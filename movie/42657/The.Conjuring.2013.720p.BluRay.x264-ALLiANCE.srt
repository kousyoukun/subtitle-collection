初次翻译字幕，如有漏误，请多多包涵指正。@塔拉Tala

00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,512
<i>It scares us just thinking about it.</i>
<i>一想到它就让我们觉得很害怕.</i>

2
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,751
<i>它都快把我们逼疯了</i>
<i>When you hear it, you're gonna</i>
<i>think we're insane.</i>

3
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,600
<i>麻烦你再重新讲一遍，从头开始。</i>
<i>Try us. Please, from the start.</i>

4
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,875
其实开始的时候并不是很严重，比如它的手或者腿的位置会移动。
It started out small,
like a hand or a leg was in a different position.

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,555
后来，它的头会突然抬起来
Then its head was looking up
instead of down.

6
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,758
再后来，有一天，我们发现它自己跑到了另外的房间里。
And then one day, it was in
a completely different room.

7
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,479
It was moving around by itself.

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,793
有没有想过也许有其他人会有你们公寓的钥匙，可能这只是个恶作剧？
Ever think maybe somebody had a key
to your apartment and was playing a trick?

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,633
我们以前有这么想过
That's exactly what we thought.

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,794
但是我们从未发现过有任何人进来的迹象。
But never once did we find any
sign or evidence of intrusion.

11
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,714
所以，你们认为你们的布偶被附身了？
And this all led you to believe
that the doll was possessed?

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,280
是的
Yes.

13
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,150
Camilla 之前联系过一个灵媒，她说有一位名叫
Camilla got in touch with a medium.
We learned from her that a 7-year-old girl...

14
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,233
Annabelle Higgins的7岁女孩曾经死在这座公寓里。
...named Annabelle Higgins
had died in this apartment.

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,110
她很孤独，而且她很喜欢我们的布偶。
She was lonely and took a liking
to my doll.

16
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,632
她只是需要朋友
All she wanted was to be friends.

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,156
听到这些之后，我们觉得很难过
When we heard this,
we felt really sorry for her.

18
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,000
我的意思是说，我们是护士，我们可以帮助别人。
I mean, we're nurses, we help people.

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,476
所以。。。
So...

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,115
我们决定让她搬到玩偶里
...we gave her permission
to move into the doll.

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,272
等等，你们做了什么?
Wait, you did what?

22
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,070
她想在玩偶里栖身，所以她就可以和我们住在一起。
She wanted to live with us
by inhabiting the doll.

23
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,435
所以我们同意了。
We said yes.

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,990
可是，接下来，事情变得更糟糕了。
But then things got worse.

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,360
天哪。。。
God.

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,352
当我们回到公寓的时候，她坐在走廊的地板上。
<i>When we came home,</i>
<i>she was sitting in the hallway.</i>

27
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,955
可实际上，我们一直让她待在客房里。
<i>But we had left her in the spare room.</i>

28
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,951
等一下，Debbie。
Debbie! Debbie, wait!

29
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,757
我们害怕极了。
We are beyond terrified.

30
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,920
我们不知道发生了什么事，也不知道应该怎么办，你能帮助我们吗?
We don't know what's going on
or what to do. Can you help us?

31
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,514
当然。
Yes, we can.

32
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,000
现在，你们听着，首先，事情并不是像你们以为的那样是鬼魂附身什么的
Now, firstly, there's no such thing
as Annabelle, and there never was.

33
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,231
而且鬼魂也不具备这样的能力。
Ghosts don't possess such power.

34
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,040
我想所有的这一切都是有什么东西在背后操纵。
I think what we have here is something
extremely manipulative.

35
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,157
一种非人类的东西。
It's something inhuman.

36
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,831
最大的问题是你们不应该理会这个玩偶。
It was a big mistake acknowledging this doll.

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,151
也正因为如此，你们才会上当。
And through that,
the inhuman spirit tricked you.

38
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,080
才会扰乱你们的生活。
You gave it permission
to infest your lives.

39
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,478
你指的是什么？
What's an inhuman spirit?

40
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,517
一种不可能和人类共生的东西。
It's something that's never walked
the earth in human form.

41
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,798
一种很邪恶的东西。
It's something demonic.

42
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,757
所以，你是说，并不是玩偶被鬼魂附身了？
So the doll was never possessed?

43
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,838
对，它只是一个被用来传递信息的载体。
No, no, it was used as a conduit.

44
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,350
It was moved around to give
the impression of possession.

45
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,196
恶灵不会控制物体，它只会控制人。
Demonic spirits don't possess things,
they possess people.

46
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,431
它真正想要的是控制你们。
It wanted to get inside of you.

47
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,191
好了，Drew，这很不错，你可以把那个关掉了。
All right, that's good, Drew.
You can shut it down now.

48
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,030
开一下灯。
Hit the lights.

49
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,157
后来，我们让教会委派一位神父过去保护那座房子和住户。
So we got the church to send a priest over...

50
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,391
...to bless the house and the occupants.

51
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,236
不管那个公寓里究竟有什么，但现在已经没事了。还有什么问题吗？
Whatever was oppressing that apartment
was no longer with them. Any questions?

52
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,396
左边的那位
Yes.

53
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,199
那个玩偶现在在哪里？
Where's the doll now?

54
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,113
在一个安全的地方
Someplace safe.

55
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,551
那一位。
那么，你们算什么？
- Yep.
- So, what are you guys?

56
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,558
我是说，别人怎么称呼你们这种人？
I mean, what do people call you?

57
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,480
哦，这个嘛，人们会叫我们驱魔师。
Uh, well, we've been called Demonologists.
That's one name for us.

58
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,353
或者捉鬼人、超自然现象研究者。
Ghost hunters, paranormal researchers.

59
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,836
怪物。哈哈～
- Kooks.
- Ha-ha-ha.

60
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,434
疯子
Wackos.

61
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,753
但是我们更喜欢别人叫我们Ed 和 Lorraine Warren
But we prefer to be known simply
as Ed and Lorraine Warren.

62
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,834
我们到了。
Here we are.

63
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,437
哇，你听到了吗？
Wow, hear that?

64
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,239
我什么都没听到。
- I don't hear anything.
- Exactly.

65
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,629
呵呵
Oh. Ha!

66
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,077
好了，伙计们，我们到了，都下车吧。
- Okay. Guys, we are here!
- Get out of the car.

67
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,118
天哪，这里真是前不着村后不着店。
Oh, God, we're in the middle of nowhere.

68
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,318
很兴奋，对不对？
是的。
Are you so excited?
Where's my "yes"? Where's my "yes"? Yes!

69
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,590
我们来赛跑吧
I'll race you!

70
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,991
你们是不是觉得很兴奋？
是的。
- Are you guys excited?
- Yes!

71
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,157
我太激动了！
快点儿，Sadie
- I'm so excited!
- Come on, Sadie!

72
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,840
我要住自己的房间。
I get my own room!

73
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,674
你开玩笑吧？你可没有优先权。
Are you kidding me?
No dibs on the rooms!

74
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,956
什么？
- What?
- What?

75
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,836
我可以挑选我自己的房间吗？
还是说我没有选择？
So do I get to pick my own room?
Or do I have no choice in that either?

76
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,671
唉～一旦她遇到一个可爱的男孩子时，她就会忘了Jersey
Well, first cute boy she meets,
she'll forget about Jersey.

77
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,115
那很好。
我希望是吧。
- Great.
- I hope.

78
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,475
我都等不及了。
I can't wait.

79
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,349
过来，Sadie。
Come on, Sadie.

80
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,874
Sadie，我们进去吧。
Sadie, let's go.

81  
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,473
嘿～快点
Hey, come.

82
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,200
你怎么了？
What's the matter with you?

83
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,113
嘿，快点儿。
Hey, come on, girl.

84
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,878
好吧，你自便吧。
All right, suit yourself.

85
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,073
你叫什么名字？
<i>- What's your name?</i>

86
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,112
你的爸爸是谁？
<i>- Who's your daddy?</i>

87
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,959
他很富有吗？
是不是像我一样富有？
<i>- He rich?</i>
<i>- Is he rich like me?</i>

88
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,236
看着脚下
Watch your step.

89
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,834
借过借过
Coming through.

90
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,716
小心点儿，爸爸
Whoa, watch out, Dad.

91
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,712
你想把它放在哪儿？
客厅
- Where do you want it?
- In the living room.

92
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,793
Andrea，我的风铃在哪里？
我想Nancy把它放到其他房间了。
- Andrea, where's my wind chime?
- I think Nancy's got it in the other room.

93
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,231
谢谢。Nancy，你见过我的风铃吗？
Thanks. Hey, Nancy,
have you seen my wind chime?

94
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,039
这个吗？
对，谢谢
- Oh, this one?
- Yeah, thanks.

95
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,034
你必须要接住它。
Nancy，放手，把它给我。
- You're gonna have to catch it.
- Nancy! Let go! Give it here.

96
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,079
你真讨厌。
You're so mean.

97
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,833
妈妈，我可以把我的风铃挂起来吗？
Hey, Mom, can I hang up
my wind chime?

98
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,390
当然，你可以挂在外边的绳子上。
Of course. There's a line outside
you can hang it on.

99
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,240
宝贝，把April带进屋，好吗？天就快要黑了。
Honey, have April come in, okay?
It's gonna be dark soon.

100
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,675
好
Okay.

101
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,878
快点，April ，妈妈让我们进去。
Come on, April! Mom wants us inside!

102
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,716
Cindy，看看我找到了什么。
Look what I found, Cindy.

103
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,714
1
<i>One...</i>

104
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,276
2
...two...

105
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,556
3
...three.

106
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,598
不许偷看
Come on, come on, come on.
No peeking.

107
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,114
4
Four.

108
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,438
你们可以把披萨都吃完吗？不要浪费。
Are you guys done with the pizza?
I don't want it going to waste.

109
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,035
我们走
养活你们这些女孩儿可真难。
- Let's go.
- It's expensive feeding you girls.

110
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,591
7，8，9，10
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

111
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,910
我应该藏在哪里？
Where should I hide?

112
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,272
准备好了吗？我要来了。。
Ready or not, here I come!

113
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,029
好，拍拍手。
Okay, clap.

114
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,597
哇
你还不熟悉这个房子。
- Whoa!
- You don't know the house well enough.

115
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,830
有人会受伤的。
Someone's gonna get hurt.

116
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,275
我没事。
I'm okay, I'm okay.

117
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,560
第二次拍手
Second clap.

118
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,080
那是作弊
That's cheating.

119
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,955
拍手
Clap.

120
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,874
抓到你了
哈哈
- Got you!
- Aah!

121
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,517
你还好吗？
嗯
- Are you okay? Um--
- Yeah.

122
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,554
打碎什么了？
All right, what did we break now?

123
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,712
我不是故意的
离开这里。
- I didn't mean to.
- Move out of there, please.

124
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,633
是Christine的错
It was Christine's fault.

125
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,031
我的错？天。。
- Oh, jeez.
- My fault? Oh, my God.

126
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,112
都是Christine搞的
不，我没有
- Christine did it.
- No, I didn't.

127
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,431
是你推我的
才不是，是你跌倒了。
- You pushed me.
- No, no, you fell back.

128
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,274
Nancy，你可以去帮我把火柴拿来吗？
Hey, Nancy, can you go get me
the matches, please?

129
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,316
发生什么事情了？
What's going on?

130
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,472
Nancy把东西打破了
闭嘴
- Nancy broke something.
- Shut up.

131
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,512
什么破了？
墙
- What broke?
- It's the wall.

132
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,718
哇哦
我想我们有一个地窖或者什么东东
- Whoa.
- I think we have a cellar or something.

133
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,280
我想看看，走开走开
I wanna see, I wanna see. Move, move, move.

134
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,555
火柴来了。谢谢你
Here, matches. Thank you.

135
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,753
我想要看看
你可以看
- I wanna see.
- You can see.

136
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,673
我想看看
你们都可以看
- I wanna see.
- You can all see.

137
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,035
Move!

138
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,072
噢，天哪
Oh, man.

139
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,876
Huh.

140
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,909
Roger？
Roger?

141
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,355
下面有什么？
What do you see down there?

142
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,039
很难描述。
Just, uh, hard to tell, you know?

143
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,156
一架老式钢琴，还有一大堆垃圾
It's an old piano
and a whole bunch of garbage.

144
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,716
妈的
Agh. Son of a--

145
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,953
哇～
Wow.

146
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,234
Rog?
Rog?

147
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,000
快上来
Come on up.

148
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,959
你们女孩子不许下去那里。
I don't want you girls going down there.

149
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,839
那个地方到处都是蜘蛛。
- That place is loaded with spiders.
- Ew!

150
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,076
别紧张
Just relax. Okay.

151
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,550
别闹了Nancy，那不好玩。
Stop it, Nancy. It's not funny.

152
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,431
总之，现在我们多了一些额外的空间。。明天早晨我会去查看一下。
We've got extra square footage anyway.
I'll check it out in the morning.

153
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,791
我想知道为什么那里被木板封起来了
我不知道
- I wonder why it was boarded up.
- I don't know.

154
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,996
好了，演出结束了。
Okay, show's over.

155
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,879
再让我们玩5分钟吧
不行
- Five minutes.
- No more minutes.

156
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,396
上床
马上上床睡觉
- Up to bed. Please. Thank you.
- Right to bed.

157
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,920
我快累死了
Man, I'm fried.

158
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,473
Sadie好像很烦躁
Something's up with Sadie.

159
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,590
嗯，我不知道是怎么回事
它死活不肯进门
Yeah, I don't know what her problem is.
Couldn't get her to come inside.

160
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,553
我们不能让她呆在外边
We can't leave her out there.

161
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,871
没事，我给她拴上链子了。
She's all right. I got her on a chain.

162
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,959
Sadie，安静点儿
Sadie, hey, be quiet.

163
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,952
谢谢你让所做的一切。
Thanks for making this work.

164
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,998
我知道你为此付出了很多
I know it was a lot to bite off.

165
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,309
一切都会好的，对吗？
It's gonna be great, isn't it?

166
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,752
我觉得已经很棒了
I think it's great already.

167
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,110
是的
Yeah.

168
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,994
你是不是累得都不能为咱们的新房子来一次“洗礼仪式”了？
You still too fried to christen
the new house?

169
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,440
谁说我累了？
Who said I'm fried?

170
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,994
咱这儿没人觉得累吗？
哈哈
- Ain't nobody here's fried.
- Ha, ha.

171
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,589
妈妈
Mom?

172
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,196
嗨，你们睡得怎么样？
Hey. How did you guys sleep?

173
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,550
好冷呀
I'm cold.

174
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,234
这里的确有点儿冷
It is chilly, isn't it?

175
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,236
难道我们就不能买一座有马桶的房子吗？
You think maybe we could have bought
a house with a toilet that actually works?

176
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,436
去跟你爸爸说吧
Tell your father.

177
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,718
昨天晚上我都房间里有一股特别臭的味道，就像有什么东西死了。
And there was a funky smell in my
room last night. Like something died.

178
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,473
现在还有吗？
没了
- Is it still there?
- No.

179
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,676
那就没事了
Problem solved.

180
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,550
Roger?
Roger?

181
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,520
Roger?
Roger?

182
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,434
在下面，亲爱的。
Down here, honey.

183
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,636
早
Morning.

184
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,876
哇哦
Ooh. Whoa.

185
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,720
要清理这里可是要费点儿功夫。
This is gonna take some
serious elbow grease.

186
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,070
是呀
Yeah.

187
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,873
噢天哪
Oh, my God.

188
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,632
我们要如何处理这些东东
What are we gonna do
with all this stuff?

189
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,235
我们可能应该就把它们全部丢掉
Well, we probably ought
to go through it, you know?

190
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,790
这里备不住藏着什么值钱的古董吧？
There might be some antiques down here
worth a lot.

191
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,634
也备不住就只是一堆垃圾，连前任房主都不想要。
Yeah, or just a lot of junk
the previous owner didn't want.

192
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,117
总之，现在都是我们的了。
嗯，都是咱的了
- It's ours now.
- Knock yourself out.

193
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,757
我去弄点儿咖啡
好
- I'm gonna make some coffee.
- Okay.

194
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,957
我要看看这个火炉还能不能用
I'm gonna see if I can get
this furnace working.

195
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,918
那太好了，这里冷得跟冰窖一样。
Yeah, that'd be nice. It's freezing.

196
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,230
嗯
Yeah.

197
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,873
HUM

198
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,034
Sadie，出来
Sadie! Come here, Sadie!

199
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,635
妈妈
Mommy!

200
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,274
妈妈，Sadie在哪儿
Mommy, where's Sadie?

201
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,753
她在外边。她肯定很饿了，你去把她牵进来吧
She's outside. You know, I'm sure she's
hungry by now. Why don't you go and get her.

202
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,796
哇哦
早上好，爸爸
- Whoa.
- Morning, Dad.

203
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,952
你能帮我拿着这个吗
嗯
- Can you hold this?
- Sure.

204
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,793
Sadie
慢一点，Scoot
- Sadie!
- Slow it down, Scoot.

205
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,235
- Roger.
嗯？
- Roger.
- Yeah.

206
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,558
这个钟停在了3：07，走廊里的那个也一样。
This clock stopped at 3:07,
and so did the one in the hallway.

207
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,120
那很古怪。
That's weird.

208
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,798
可能坏了吧
Maybe it got knocked around in the move.

209
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,839
说到这个，顺便问一下，你对我的腿做了什么？
Speaking of knocked around,
what did you do to me last night?

210
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,754
噢～我没有做什么呀，那是我弄得吗？
我不知道
- Ouch. I didn't do that. Did l?
- I don't know.

211
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,355
Sadie
Sadie!

212
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,356
April， April
April! April!

213
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,115
April，你怎么了？
What's--? April! What's going on?

214
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,590
发生什么事了
噢天哪
- What happened?
- Oh, my God!

215
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,400
噢～Sadie
Oh, Sadie.

216
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,557
我们把所有的东东都锁在这里
We keep everything locked in here.

217
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,753
你随便看看吧
Feel free to look around.

218
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,793
但是什么都别碰
Just don't touch anything.

219
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,759
哇
Wow.

220
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,520
这简直太疯狂了
This is crazy.

221
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,433
那么，所有的这些玩意儿都来自你所调查过的那些案子？
So all these are taken from cases
you've investigated?

222
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,560
对，你所看到的所有的东东都是被恶灵附体的，被诅咒过的，
That's right. Everything you see
in here is either haunted, cursed...

223
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,673
或者是被用来举行某种仪式的
...or has been used in some kind
of ritualistic practice.

224
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,993
连玩具也是？
Nothing's a toy.

225
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,833
甚至就连那个玩具猴子也一样
Not even the toy monkey.

226
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,714
别碰～！
Don't touch it.

227
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,392
那，这些东东都放在你的房间里你不觉得害怕吗？或者担忧？
Oh, ahem. Well, isn't it scary,
or doesn't it worry you...

228
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,836
或者担忧？
...to have all these items
right in your home?

229
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,391
这就是为什么每个月神父都会来这里的原因。
That's why we have a priest that comes by
once a month to bless the room.

230
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,755
我对此的看法是，
Well, the way I see it is:

231
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,560
它们待在这座房子里要远远比待在外边更安全。
It's safer for these things
to be in here than out there.

232
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,518
这和要让枪支远离街头的道理的一样的。
It's kind of like keeping guns
off the street.

233
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,752
为什么不直接把它们扔进焚化炉里烧毁它们？
Why not just throw them
in an incinerator? Destroy them.

234
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,838
那没什么用，能烧毁的仅仅是这些被利用的物体而已。
Well, that would only destroy the vessel.

235
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,159
有时候，最好的办法是把鬼啊妖怪什么的封在瓶子里。
Sometimes it's better to keep
the genie in the bottle.

236
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,194
玩偶Annabelle是不是也在这里？
Say, is the, uh, Annabelle doll here?

237
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,474
就在这边。
Right this way.

238
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,075
嗯
Yeah.

239
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,315
你说过她只是一个载体？
对
- You said she's a conduit?
- That's right.

240
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,675
那指的是什么意思？
What does that mean?

241
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,675
她被有一个力量非常强大的恶灵侵占了
A very powerful demonic
has latched itself onto her.

242
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,799
你们就是研究类似恶灵缠身这类事情的？
So when you guys investigate
these hauntings...

243
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,191
你如何来避免它们接近你？
...how do you stop them
from latching onto you?

244
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,919
我们必须要高度警惕
We have to take great precaution.

245
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,713
那，你的妻子呢？
But what about your wife?

246
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,954
她怎么了？
What about her?

247
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,878
神父Gordon告诉过我。
Well, Father Gordon told me that--

248
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,520
噢，那不一样。
Well, that was different.

249
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,879
我妻子是在驱魔的时候出事的

What happened to my wife
happened during an exorcism.

250
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,713
那有什么不同？
Well, what's the difference?

251
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,755
抱歉
Excuse me.

252
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,789
宝贝，你在干什么？
Honey, what are you doing?

253
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,390
过来这里
Come here.

254
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,910
你很清楚你不该来这里，对吗？
You know better. All right?

255
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,514
Georgiana?
Georgiana?

256
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,076
过来～！你有没有碰过什么东西？
没有
- Come on. Did you touch anything?
- No.

257
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,560
好吧，过来宝贝
All right, come on, honey.

258
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,960
Georgiana，你能带Judy上楼吗？
好的
- Georgiana! Could you take Judy upstairs?
- Oh, sure.

259
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,589
不管怎么样，你都不可以进这个房间，记住了吗?
You can't go into this room,
no matter what, remember?

260
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,194
知道了爸爸
好
- Yes, Daddy.
- All right.

261
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,270
去吧
好，过来
- Go on.
- Okay, come on.

262
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,478
我来给你找点儿吃的，好吗？走吧
Let's see if I can find you
a little snack, okay? Come on.

263
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,791
这里发生什么事了？
Hey. What's going on in here?

264
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,429
爸爸，你看
你看起来真漂亮
- Daddy, look.
- You look very pretty.

265
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,956
弄好了。
去穿好衣服，该吃晚饭了。
All right, all done.
Go get dressed for dinner.

266
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,954
我要穿着这个吃晚饭
不行。
- I'm wearing it to dinner.
- No, you're not!

267
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,355
给你
Here you go.

268
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,440
怎么样？
How'd it go?

269
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,717
我想他可能会写一篇正面的文章
Oh, I think he may write a positive article.

270
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,792
噢，一个无神论者
Ooh, a non-skeptic.

271
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,675
那会是个可喜的改变。
That's a pleasant change.

272
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,990
嗯
Yeah.

273
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,633
不要再责备你自己了。
Stop blaming yourself.

274
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,034
没加糖吗？
No sugar.

275
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,674
我马上回来
Be right back.

276
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,437
别闹了，Nancy
Not funny, Nancy.

277
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,829
什么？
What?

278
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,597
别拽我的脚
Stop grabbing my foot.

279
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,917
我什么都没做。
Shut up, I didn't do anything.

280
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,194
嗯～
Yeah, right.

281
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,877
也别再放屁了
And stop farting.

282
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,118
臭死人了
It really stinks.

283
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,031
明明是你放的屁，别什么都怪在我头上，Pew.
Don't blame that on me. It's you. Pew.

284
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,390
爸爸
Dad?

285
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,592
Andrea，为什么你要起床？
Andrea, what are you doing out of bed?

286
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,035
那是什么声音
What's that sound?

287
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,114
那是Cindy，她在我房间，她又梦游了。
It's Cindy. She's in my room.
She's sleepwalking again.

288
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,677
我以前从未见过她这样
I've never seen her do this before.

289
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,230
我记得你说过如果她梦游的时候不要叫醒她。
I remembered you saying not
to wake her if she's like this.

290
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,312
不要，我们把她抱回床上就好
No, we just put her back to bed.

291
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,995
嗨，宝贝～
Hey, hey. Sweetie. Shh.

292
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,155
我们回床上去吧
Let's go back to bed.

293
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,953
她没事了，晚安。
She's okay. Good night.

294
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,315
晚安
Night.

295
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,438
她有梦游了?
她已经有一阵子不这样了
<i>She's sleepwalking again?</i>
<i>She hasn't done that for awhile.</i>

296
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,192
她又去了Andrea的房间
我想Andrea可能被吓到了。
She ended up in Andrea's room too.
I think kind of freaked her out.

297
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,955
那很糟糕，我们应该怎么办
我不知道
- That's not good. What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

298
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,680
宝贝，你这里又有其他的伤痕了
是吗？
- Honey, you got another bruise here.
- Hmm?

299
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,280
痛不痛?
Does that hurt?

300
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,356
太怪异了
That's weird.

301
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,473
是啊，你可不可以去找个医生看看?
I don't know. Will you do me a favor,
go see a doctor for that?

302
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,596
嗯，我会的。小心开车。
好的
- Yeah, I will. Drive safe.
- Yeah.

303
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,479
我爱你
我也爱你
- I love you.
- I love you too.

304
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,076
88
Bye!

305
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,720
爱你
Love you!

306
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,759
Cindy，你吃过午饭了吗？
吃过了
- Cindy, you have your lunch?
- Yeah.

307
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,391
是的
Yes, I do.

308
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,392
我好想Sadie呀
I miss Sadie a lot.

309
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,916
她是我最好的朋友
She was my best friend.

310
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,998
你也是我的朋友，对吗？
You're my friend, right?

311
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,239
我们来玩吧
Yeah, let's play.

312
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,114
你在跟谁说话？
Rory.

- Who are you talking to?
- Rory.

313
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,670
Rory？
Rory?

314
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,072
他是我的新朋友
噢，是吗？
- He's my new friend.
- Oh, really?

315
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,312
嗯哼，你想要见见他吗？
当然，可是要怎么见？
- Yeah, do you want to see him?
- Yeah. Uh-huh. How?

316
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,914
用这个
With this.

317
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,756
音乐停止的时候你就会从镜子里看到他站在你的身后
When the music stops, you see him
in the mirror standing behind you.

318
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,790
好
Okay.

319
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,872
但是你必须要拧钥匙
But you have to twist the key.

320
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,235
好
Okay.

321
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,400
妈妈，哈哈
喔～
- Boo, Mommy! Ha-ha!
- Oh!

322
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,879
April，你吓得我心脏病都快发作了
哈哈，骗到你了
- April, you just gave me a heart attack.
- Got you!

323
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,912
好吧，我猜Rory可能不想看到我，是吗？
Well, okay, I guess Rory
doesn't want to see me, huh?

324
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,309
嗯嗯
Hmm. Oh, well.

325
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,153
我们可以玩躲猫猫？
Can we play hide-and-clap?

326
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,596
躲猫猫？
噢～宝贝，我不太想玩
Hide-and-cla--?
Oh, honey, I don't want to play.

327
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,356
求你了妈妈，从来没有人让我玩儿
好吧好吧
- Please! Nobody ever lets me play.
- Okay, okay.

328
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,317
你要记得让我拍三次手。
Remember, you get to ask me
for three claps.

329
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,516
好
Okay.

330
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,878
1，2，3
One, two, three.

331
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,679
我要找地方藏起来了
好
- I'm gonna go hide now!
- Okay.

332
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,514
4，5
Four, five...

333
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,559
6，7
...six, seven...

334
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,076
8，9
...eight, nine...

335
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,955
10
...ten!

336
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,154
第一次拍手
First clap!

337
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,478
噢 糟糕
Ow. Shit.

338
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,154
第二次拍手
Second clap!

339
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,036
April.
April.

340
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,434
April.
April.

341
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,674
我知道你藏在哪儿
Oh, I know where you're hiding.

342
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,951
还要拍一次手
Give me the third clap.

343
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,954
我要抓到你了
I'm gonna get you now.

344
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,039
我可以听到你的呼吸声
I can hear you breathing.

345
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,040
April.
April.

346
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,440
April.
April.

347
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,436
哈哈，你摘掉眼罩了，，，我赢咯。。
Ha, ha. You took your blindfold off. I win!

348
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,475
你都没有提前发出警告，妈妈
我藏在Christine和Nancy的房间里
You weren't even warm, Mom.
I was in Christine and Nancy's room.

349
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,795
我必须要在这里弄一些routes
不然保险的损失就太大了
<i>I gotta have some routes here,</i>
<i>or I'm gonna lose the insurance on the rig.</i>

350
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,480
那差不多占了一半
That's like half of my rate, man.

351
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,152
好吧
Yeah, okay.

352
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,232
好吧，我会的
I'll, uh-- Yeah, I'll take it.

353
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,675
谢谢
Thank you.

354
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,359
什么是route？
哦，是Florida
- What's the route?
- It's, uh, Florida.

355
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,240
明天开始。
It's a week turnaround. I start tomorrow.

356
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,554
我们会解决这个问题
We'll get through this.

357
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,596
嗯
Yeah.

358
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,080
好了，我们去睡觉吧
Come on, let's go to bed.

359
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,996
别闹了Nancy，那没什么好玩的
Stop it, Nancy. It's not funny anymore.

360
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,232
我在努力入睡，请不要再拽我的脚丫子了
I'm trying to sleep,
please stop grabbing my feet.

361
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,034
Nancy
Nancy?

362
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,599
Nancy
Nancy?

363
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,719
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

364
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,640
Christine
Christine?

365
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,430
你还好吗？
Are you all right?

366
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,760
你看到它了吗？
Do you see it?

367
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,755
看到什么？
See what?

368
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,311
有人在门后面
There's someone behind the door.

369
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,709
什么？
What?

370
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,920
There's someone standing over there.
有人站在那边

371
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,396
我怎么看不见
I don't see anyone.

372
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,150
它在看着我们
It's looking right at us.

373
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,920
Nancy，别！
Nancy, don't! Nancy.

374
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,515
我没闹，你看！
No, no. Look. Look.

375
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,151
你看，这里什么都没有，看到了吗?
Look, there's no one here. See?

376
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,794
又是那个味道
Ugh. It's that smell again.

377
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,271
噢天哪
Oh, my God.

378
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,913
它就站在你身后
It's standing right behind you.

379
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,918
Christine，Christine，Christine
Christine?! Christine! Christine!

380
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,440
门打不开
God, it won't op--

381
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,712
Christine
不要～～
- Christine!
- No! No! No!

382
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,913
发生什么事了？怎么了？
这里有其他的人。
- What's going on? What happened?
- There was someone else in here!

383
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,116
什么？
在哪儿？
- What?
- Where?

384
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,557
在就门那里，在门后面
By the door. It was behind the door.

385
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,275
宝贝，这里什么都没有
没有人在这里
Honey, there's nothing in here.
There's nobody in here.

386
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,238
有其他人在这里
There was someone else in here!

387
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,838
我正在睡觉，突然有人拽我的脚
I was just sleeping, and then
I felt somebody grab my feet.

388
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,310
那时我以为是Nancy
So I thought it was Nancy.

389
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,797
宝贝，我肯定那只是个噩梦而已。
Well, honey, I'm pretty sure
that it was just a bad dream.

390
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,555
不是，它跟我说话了
No! It talked to me!

391
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,638
它说
It said...

392
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,870
它想要我们全家都死。
...that it wants my family dead.

393
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,389
Winston先生
<i>Mr. Winston!</i>

394
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,553
Winston？Winston？
Winston? Winston?

395
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,320
去他后面
Get behind him.

396
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,156
你要去哪里？
Where you off to?

397
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,789
我要去商店买点儿东西
I just gotta run to the store
for a few things.

398
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,959
为什么你还要继续尝试？
你什么意思？
- Why do you even try?
- What? What do you mean?

399
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,680
得了吧，都15年了，你怎么还可能瞒得过我？
In 15 years have you
ever been able to lie to me?

400
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,799
Gordon神父打电话说，他那里有件案子想让我们去调查一下
Father Gordon called. He's got
a case he wants us to look into.

401
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,520
我跟他说我会自己去看看
Lorraine，我是说只有我自己去。
I said I'd go check it out myself.
Lorraine, myself.

402
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,034
我和你一起去
I'm going with you.

403
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,270
我知道你很担心那种事会再次发生
I know you're worried
it's gonna happen again.

404
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,238
是啊，当然了。我很担心。
Yeah, I am. I really am.

405
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,920
我想我们也许是时候该休息一下了，顺便写完那本书。
Maybe it's just time we take a break.
Write that book.

406
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,954
你还记不记得在我们的婚礼上你跟我说过什么？
Do you remember what you said to me
on our wedding night?

407
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,959
我们可以再来一次吗？
"Can we do it again?"

408
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,990
在那之后
After that.

409
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,229
你说上帝让我们在一起是有原因的，对吗?
You said that God brought us together
for a reason. Right?

410
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,359
我很确定它让我们在一起并不是为了让我们一起写本书
I'm pretty sure it's not to write a book.

411
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,713
我去换衣服
I'm gonna get dressed.

412
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,356
我们把那个声音分离出来了
<i>We've isolated the disturbances to the attic.</i>

413
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,840
我想要你听一下这个
<i>I want you to listen for a second.</i>

414
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,270
天那，就是那个
Oh, my God, that's it.

415
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,354
再来一次，Ed
Do it again, Ed.

416
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,551
现在就只是我的重量
因为你把水管里的水排干了
Right now it's just my weight.
But you take the water coming off the pipe...

417
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,280
风从这个破了的窗户里吹进来，进入管道
...combined with the wind coming
through the broken window...

418
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,750
就会导致这些木板会互相碰撞和摩擦
...these boards are gonna expand
and rub against each other.

419
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,715
这些管道都通向暖气片，所以你可以在整个房间里都听到这些声音
You heard it all through the house
because of these pipes leading to the radiator.

420
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,832
你是说，这个房间没问题
So this place isn't haunted?

421
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,593
是的，完全没问题
No, it rarely is.

422
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,555
类似这样的情况通常都会有合理的解释。
Yeah, there's usually always
some kind of rational explanation.

423
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,440
姑娘们，已经过了就寝时间了
Girls, it's way past your bedtime.

424
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,040
那是谁
Who is that?

425
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,000
究竟是谁在下面？
我要把你锁起来
Who's ever down there,
I'm gonna lock you in now!

426
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,716
Aah! Unh.

427
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,800
Aah!

428
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,434
救命
Help!

429
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,398
Andrea，救命～！
Andrea! Help!

430
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,515
嗨～想要玩躲猫猫吗？
<i>Hey, wanna play hide-and-clap?</i>

431
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,353
Aah!

432
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,389
Cindy？
Cindy?

433
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,032
好吧。。。
Okay, now....

434
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,509
好吗？
All right?

435
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,274
听话～过来
All right, come on.

436
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,869
Come on.

437
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,115
过来
There you go.

438
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,077
今晚你可以和我睡在一起，好吗？
Okay, you can just sleep with me tonight,
all right?

439
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,314
来，躺下
There you go.

440
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,870
There.

441
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,955
Andrea？
救命～～
- Andrea?
- Help! Help! Help!

442
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,753
谁在里面？
Andrea！
- Who's in here?
- Andrea!

443
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,116
Andrea，Andrea，
Andrea? Andrea!

444
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,396
在里面
In here!

445
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,035
救命·～爸爸，救命呀。。是Andrea。
Help, Daddy! Help, it's Andrea!

446
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,634
谁在里面？
Andrea。。
- Who's in here?
- Andrea!

447
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,600
出什么事了？
What happened?

448
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,195
有没有人能告诉我究竟发生什么事了？
Somebody, goddamn it,
tell me what's going on here?

449
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:22,270
我们通常所指的恐惧，是指人们在面对来自鬼怪的威胁时所导致的
<i>Fear is defined as a feeling of agitation</i>
<i>and anxiety caused by the presence...</i>

450
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,954
害怕和焦虑不安的感觉
<i>...or imminence of danger.</i>

451
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,632
无论是鬼魂，或者恶灵
他们都以此为生
<i>Whether it's a ghost, a spirit</i>
<i>or an entity, they all feed on it.</i>

452
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,836
这个是Maurice
Take Maurice here.

453
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,192
一个只受过三年教育的法裔加拿大农夫
A French-Canadian farmer with
no more than a third-grade education...

454
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,876
当他被附身了之后，他可以讲一口流利的拉丁语。
...yet after he was possessed,
spoke some of the best Latin I'd ever heard.

455
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,269
但有时候前好相反
Sometimes backwards.

456
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,150
他曾经被他的父亲性侵过，并且也常常被虐待。
He'd been molested by his father,
who had also tortured him repeatedly.

457
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,796
一个恶灵入侵了他。
A dark spirit made its home in this man.

458
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,398
现在，如果你注视着他的眼睛，你可以看到他的眼睛在流血
Now, if you look into his eyes,
you can see him tearing blood.

459
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,394
And like that...

460
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,713
他的身体上出现了一个倒置的十字
...an upside-down cross started
to appear from within his body.

461
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,671
好了，Drew，你可以打开灯
All right, Drew, you can hit the lights.

462
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,196
Oh.

463
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,716
你有没有亲自驱过魔？
Did you personally perform the exorcism?

464
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,719
没有，我没有得到许可
不过我做过许多辅助工作
No, I'm not authorized.
But I've assisted on many.

465
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,832
驱魔是非常危险的工作
See, an exorcism
can be very dangerous...

466
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,038
不仅仅是针对受害者，而是要针对所有住在房子里的人。
...not only for the victim,
but for anyone in the room.

467
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,110
Maurice究竟做了什么？
他想要杀了他的妻子。。
- What happened to Maurice?
- He tried to kill his wife...

468
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,632
但是子弹却射到了她的胳膊上。然后他开枪自杀了。
...but instead shot her in the arm
and then turned the gun on himself.

469
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,237
Maurice的一生非常糟坎坷，也很短暂
Maurice had a very troubled life
with little to live for...

470
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,279
没有任何一位驱魔人能救他
...and not even an exorcist
could bring him back.

471
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,878
他已经处在恶灵附身的第三个阶段了
Which brings us to the three stages
of demonic activity:

472
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,271
侵扰，胁迫，占有
Infestation, oppression and possession.

473
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,794
现在我们来说说侵扰
Now, infestation:

474
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,920
通常都是低语，脚步声，对其他未知物质的感知
That's the whispering, the footsteps,
the feeling of another presence...

475
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,750
然后会进入第二个阶段：胁迫
...which ultimately grows
into oppression, the second stage.

476
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,196
在这个阶段，那些心理脆弱的人
Now this is where the victim,
and it's usually the one...

477
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,238
往往会成为受害者
...who's the most
psychologically vulnerable...

478
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,279
...is targeted specifically
by an external force.

479
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,877
这些受害者的行为将会不受自己的意愿所控制
Breaks the victim down.
Crushes their will.

480
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:06,280
一旦处在这种弱势的状态下，就会很容易进入第三个也就是最后的阶段：占有
And, once in a weakened state, leads them
to the third and final stage: possession.

481
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,999
嗨～Ed? Lorraine?
嗯
- Hey, Ed? Lorraine?
- Yeah.

482
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,595
这里有个人想要跟你说句话
There's someone here
that would like to talk to you.

483
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,796
嗨～
谢谢你，Drew.
- Hi.
- Thanks, Drew.

484
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,440
谢谢你
回头见
- Thank you.
- I'll see you later.

485
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,670
你有什么事吗？
How can we help you?

486
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:22,153
我的房子里发生了一些非常糟糕的事，你们可以过来看一下吗？
There's something horrible happening in
my house. Could you come and take a look?

487
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,272
现在恐怕有点儿太晚了
You know, uh, it's getting kinda late.

488
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,194
我们真的需要回家了
你不明白。。
- We really need to head to our family.
- You don't understand.

489
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,239
我们理解你的心情，不过，你所说的事通常都会有合理的解释
But we do. There's usually some
sort of rational explanation--

490
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,156
我的五个女儿现在都害怕得要死
我很担心那个东西会伤害我们
I have five daughters who are scared to death.
I'm so afraid this thing wants to hurt us.

491
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:39,155
你们也有女儿，难道你们不会想尽一切办法来保护你们的女儿？
You have a daughter. Wouldn't you do
anything you could to protect her? Please.

492
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,516
求你了～就过来看一下
Please can you come and take a look?

493
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,235
好吧，我们会去。
Of course we will.

494
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,600
我们会的
Of course we will.

495
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,671
快点Jan，快点打开
<i>Come on, Jan! Open up!</i>

496
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,560
Jan，出什么事了？
<i>Jan, what happened?</i>

497
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,513
你的头顶变成黑色了
<i>The top of your head turned black.</i>

498
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,433
你们都站起来，整理一下
You guys straighten up? Thanks.

499
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,398
别傻了，那是假发
<i>Don't be silly, it's a wig.</i>

500
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,680
你好
你好
- Hello. Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

501
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,240
谢谢你们能过来
Thanks for coming.

502
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,713
嗨，我是Roger
我是Lorraine
- Hi, I'm Roger.
- Lorraine.

503
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,196
很高兴见到你，Roger.我是 Ed Warren.
Hey, nice to meet you, Roger. Ed Warren.

504
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,638
谢谢，快请进
- Thanks for coming.
- Please, come in.

505
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,035
谢谢
Thank you.

506
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,670
那么。。
So....

507
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,833
噢，这些漂亮的女孩子们是谁呀？
Oh, my God. Look at you all.
Who are these beautiful young women?

508
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,357
这是 Andrea, 她最大。Nancy, Cindy, Christine...
This is Andrea, the oldest,
Nancy, Cindy, Christine...

509
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,119
这位是April
...and April.

510
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,274
这两位是Warren先生和夫人
It's Mr. and Mrs. Warren.

511
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,554
我们现在都睡在这里
嗯
- We're all sleeping down here now.
- Mm.

512
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,754
女孩们觉得安全一点，也比较暖和。
The girls feel safer and it's warmer.

513
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,636
我总是开着暖气，可是这个房子里总是那么冷
I'm constantly turning up the heat,
but the house is always freezing.

514
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,712
不过那不是火炉的问题
It's not a problem with the furnace.

515
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,155
我是说，我不知道是什么原因
I mean, not that I can find.

516
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,155
过去的几个晚上，这里发生了太多糟糕的事情
It's gotten a lot worse the past few nights.

517
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:09,039
这里有一股很难闻的味道，就像腐烂的肉一样，整个房子里都是这股味儿
There's this awful smell, like rotting meat.
It moves around the house.

518
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,070
Uh....

519
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,435
怎么了？那是什么？
What? What is it?

520
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:20,519
腐肉的味道可能意味着有某种恶灵在这里出没
Well, rancid smells could indicate
some type of demonic activity.

521
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,830
噢，天哪
Oh, my God.

522
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,556
那是为了晚上的时候防止那些撞门的声音
That's to keep those doors
from banging at night.

523
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,157
整个晚上都像这样，
Otherwise, it's like:
All night long, just like that.

524
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,637
一次敲三下？
对
- Does it come in threes?
- Yeah.

525
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,950
黎明的时候就会停止？
It stops at dawn?

526
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,755
对
Uh-huh.

527
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,037
有时候那可能意味着是对三位一体的一种侮辱。
Well, sometimes it's meant
as an insult to the Trinity:

528
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,157
所谓的三位一体，就是指基督教里的圣父、圣子及圣灵
The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

529
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,476
最奇怪的事情是，有很多小鸟
You know, it's the damndest thing,
but we also get all kinds of birds...
总是会飞来撞墙，直到撞断自己的脖子

530
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,639
...that will just fly against the side
of the house and break their necks.

531
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,439
真的吗？
Hm. Really?

532
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,030
还有，房间里的钟表总是会停在凌晨3：07
And the clocks stop at 3:07 a.m.

533
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,271
所有的钟表？
是的
- All of them?
- Every one.

534
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,434
我们本来把那些照片挂在楼梯边的墙壁上
Oh, we were hanging those
along the stairs.

535
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,879
但是总是有什么东西会把它们弄下来，所以就没有再挂了
Something just kept knocking them down,
so we stopped hanging them up.

536
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,596
那就是我想要说到的
That's what I was talking about.

537
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,673
我们刚刚搬进来的时候
It was here when we moved in.

538
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,036
这里有一个地窖，堆满了各种东西。
There's also a lot of stuff in the cellar.

539
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,440
带我去那个地窖
Show me the cellar.

540
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,155
看看她让我干了什么
<i>Look what she made me do.</i>

541
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,790
你正在接收那些信息，对吗宝贝？
You picking up anything in here, hon?

542
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,274
这里曾经发生过很糟糕的事情，Ed
Something awful happened here, Ed.

543
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,312
那些擦伤，也是来这里以后发生的吗？
Those bruises, they from something
that happened here?

544
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:01,520
噢，那个嘛～我有点贫血。
Oh, it's some iron deficiency thing I have.

545
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,070
既然发生了这么多事，为什么你们不从这里搬出去
You know, with all that's been going on,
why haven't you just moved out?

546
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,357
我不知道应该去哪里
I don't know where
we'd move to, you know?

547
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,833
我们用所有的钱买了这所房子，另外也已经做了各种修理
We got all our money tied up in this place
and had a lot of repairs on top of that.

548
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,474
我也不知道有谁会让我们这么一大家子暂住。
And I don't know anybody whose gonna
take in a family of seven indefinitely.

549
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,558
这也就是为什么我们会去找你们。
That's why we tracked you down.

550
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,793
我们很高兴你们找到我们
We're glad you found us.

551
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,590
我们开始吧
All right, let's get started.

552
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,157
我是Ed Warren，现在是1971年11月1号
My name is Ed Warren.
It's November 1st, 1971.

553
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,352
我和Carolyn Perron坐在这里
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

554
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,719
她和她的家人最近正在经历一些超自然的事件。
...who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.

555
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,120
你来说
Okay, go ahead.

556
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,040
我们从哪里开始？
Where do I start?

557
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,273
从最初的发生的事情开始
From the first occurrence.

558
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,357
我猜应该是从那些钟表开始
I guess it was the clocks.

559
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,477
妈妈和爸爸告诉我，你有一个朋友
Mom and Dad tell me
that you have a friend.

560
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,871
他的名字叫Rory，他也住在这里。
His name's Rory.
He lives here too.

561
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,872
噢。
可是他总是很悲伤
- Hmm.
- But he's always sad.

562
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,076
为什么？
Why is that?

563
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,029
他不要告诉我，可是我觉得他可能遇到过不好的事。
He won't tell me but I think
something bad happened to him.

564
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,991
你介不介意我见见Rory？
Do you mind if I try to see Rory?

565
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,150
嗨～
Hey.

566
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,195
怎么了？
What is it?

567
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,479
这座房子是我们从拍卖会上买的，所以我们也不晓得以前住在这里的是谁。
We bought it at auction from the bank, so,
you know, we never knew who lived here.

568
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:24,360
Lorraine和我都觉得你们的房子需要清洁。
Well, Lorraine and I both feel that
what your house needs is a cleansing.

569
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,835
我是说，需要驱魔
An exorcism.

570
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,874
什么？驱魔？
What, exorcism?

571
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,799
我以为需要驱魔的是人，而不是房子
I thought that was something
that you do to people.

572
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,354
不，那不一定。

No, not necessarily, no.

573
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,320
我们必须要离开这里
We have to get out of here.

574
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,472
恐怕那已经没有用了
I'm afraid that's not gonna help.

575
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,796
Lorraine看见了一些东西
Lorraine saw something, which--

576
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,235
你来告诉他们，宝贝
Go ahead, hon.

577
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,037
我一直能看到有黑色的东西在你们的房子里出没
I've been seeing the dark entity
that haunts your house...

578
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,714
还有房子外面
<i>...and your land.</i>

579
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,756
我刚刚进门的时候就看到它了
I saw it first when I came
through your door.

580
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,116
在你们的身后
<i>It was latched to your back.</i>

581
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,679
后来我又在客厅里看到它，和那些女孩子们在一起
<i>And then I saw it again with the girls</i>
<i>when we walked into the living room.</i>

582
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,876
无论你们去哪里
And it doesn't matter where you go...

583
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,198
那个黑死的东西都会附着在你的家人身上
...this dark entity has latched itself
to your family...

584
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,874
它的存在完全是依靠你们
...and it's feeding off you.

585
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,077
即使我们离开这里？
Even if we leave?

586
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,914
有时候，当你们被附身以后，就好象踩在口香糖上
Sometimes when you get haunted,
it's like stepping on gum.

587
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,358
你走到哪里，它们就会跟到哪里
You take it with you.

588
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,512
听着，我必须要告诉你
这里有很多恶灵
Look, I gotta tell you,
you have a lot of spirits in here...

589
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,277
但是有一个让我很担心，它非常可怕
...but this is the one that I'm most
worried about, because it is so hateful.

590
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,999
好吧，那我们该怎么办？
我们可以请一个神父吗？
Okay, so what do we do?
Can we call a priest?

591
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,480
要是那么容易就好了
I wish it were that easy.

592
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,634
驱魔是一项很古老的仪式，需要经过很多年的练习。
Performing an exorcism is an archaic
procedure. Requires years of training.

593
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,560
即便如此，还是会出错
And even then,
I have seen it go horribly wrong.

594
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,230
而且，在那之前，首先要得到教会的批准
But before we even get that far,
the church has to authorize it first.

595
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,632
那就意味着我们必须要先调查和研究，收集证据并且能证明这里的确存在恶灵
It means we gotta investigate,
gather evidence and provide proof...

596
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,320
那是最难的部分
...and that's the hard part.

597
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,199
你们的孩子们有没有受洗？
Have your children been baptized?

598
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,673
没有，我们一直没有来得及做那个，实际上我们也不算是虔诚的教会家庭。
Uh, no, we never got around to that.
We're not really a churchgoing family.

599
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,516
你们可能需要重新考虑一下，我们出现在这里只会让事情变得更糟糕/
Well, you may want to rethink that.
Our presence here could make things worse.

600
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,796
为什么?
Why?

601
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,314
因为对他们来说，我们是个威胁
Because we're a threat.

602
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,399
但是你们不一样，无论你们做什么，都不会像我们一样。
And whatever you're dealing with here
isn't gonna like us.

603
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,110
到目前为止它没有做过任何暴力的事情，那是个很好的预兆
So far it hasn't done anything violent,
and that's a good sign.

604
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,199
我们会让我们的人去查一下这座房子的来源
So we're gonna have our guy
do some homework on the property...

605
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,158
看看我们面对的究竟是什么东东
...to see what we're up against.

606
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,198
Judy，你在做什么?
<i>Judy, what are you up to?</i>

607
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,114
我给你带了件礼物
- I got you a present.
- Aah.

608
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,352
我和Nanna去教堂院子里的售卖会了
Me and Nanna got these
at the church's yard sale.

609
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,352
宝贝
一个给你，一个给我
- Honey.
- One for you and one for me.

610
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,079
哇哦
她放了一张你和爸爸的照片在我的项链里
- Aw.
- She put a picture...

611
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,515
...of you and Daddy in mine.

612
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,192
Nanna说这样一来我们就会永远在一起了
Nanna said this way
we'll always be together.

613
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,875
你会和我在一起，我会和你在一。
You'll be with me and I'll be with you.

614
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,677
我很想你和爸爸
I miss you and Daddy.

615
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,436
嘿～宝贝
Hey, hon.

616
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,716
嗯？
Yup.

617
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,714
你肯定不会相信，Carolyn的声音没有被录进去。
You're not gonna believe this.
Carolyn's voice didn't record.

618
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,116
你说什么？
What do you mean?

619
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,275
你听
Listen.

620
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,237
我是Ed Warren，现在是1971年11月1日
<i>My name is Ed Warren.</i>
<i>It's November 1st, 1971.</i>

621
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,232
我和Carolyn Perron坐在这里
<i>I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...</i>

622
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,837
她和她的家人最近正在经历一些超自然的事件。
<i>...who, with her family, has been</i>
<i>experiencing supernatural occurrences.</i>

623
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,554
你说吧
<i>Okay, go ahead.</i>

624
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,598
从开始讲
<i>From the first occurrence.</i>

625
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,475
你听，什么都没有
Nothing.

626
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,230
全都没有
The whole time.

627
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,955
我不知道，你发现什么了吗？
太多了
- I don't know. You find anything?
- Lots.

628
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,559
我是说，难怪他们要经历这一切
I mean, it's no wonder they're
going through what they are.

629
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,752
那是最早期的农舍
That's the original farmhouse.

630
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,992
是由一个叫Jedson Sherman的男人建于1863年
It was built in 1863 by a man
named Jedson Sherman...

631
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,755
他娶了一个叫Bathsheba的女人
...who was married to a woman
named Bathsheba.

632
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,192
Ed，Bathsheba和Mary Towne Estye是亲戚
Ed, she's related to Mary Towne Estye.

633
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,511
她是那些在Salem被控告的女巫之一。
She was one of the women
accused of witchcraft in Salem.

634
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,592
她在审讯期间被吊死了
哇哦
- She was hung during the trials.
- Wow.

635
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,639
Bathsheba嫁给Jedson之后，生了一个孩子。
After Bathsheba married Jedson,
they had a baby...

636
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,638
那个孩子7岁的时候
...and when the baby was 7 days old...

637
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,719
Jedson发现她正在壁炉前面用她的孩子献祭。
...Jedson caught her sacrificing it
in front of the fireplace.

638
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,951
她跑到码头前的那棵树前
She ran out to that tree by the dock...

639
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,271
爬上树，宣告她热爱撒旦
...climbed up, proclaimed her love
to Satan...

640
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,320
并且诅咒任何想要拿走她的土地的人，然后上吊死了。
...cursed anyone who tried
to take her land, and hung herself.

641
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,756
她死亡的时间正好是凌晨3：07
Time of death was pronounced at 3:07
in the morning.

642
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,873
噢，那可以解释一些事。
Well, that explains a few things.

643
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,759
嗯，这个也是。
Yeah, so does this.

644
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,070
她最后的名字是Walker，30年代的时候她住在那里
Her last name's Walker.
She lived there in the '30s.

645
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,318
她有个孩子名字叫Rory，他在树林里神秘地消失了
She had a boy named Rory who
mysteriously disappeared in the woods.

646
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,278
在那之后，她在地窖里自杀了。
Then she killed herself in the cellar.

647
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,356
那还不是全部
And that's not all.

648
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:47,710
从那之后，这座200亩土地就被分块，廉价出售了
So, what was the original 200-acre farm
has since been subdivided and sold off.

649
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,880
这里还有另外一个男孩子在池塘里淹死了。他住在旁边的房子里
There was another boy who drowned in
a pond here. He lived in a house over here.

650
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:56,159
还有一位女仆，也在隔壁的房子里自杀了。
And a woman who worked as a maid in a
neighboring home, she committed suicide too.

651
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,912
无论是谁得到她的土地
People who took her land.

652
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,796
我和Carolyn Perron坐在这里
<i>I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...</i>

653
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:07,158
她和她的家人最近正在经历一些超自然的事件。
<i>...who, with her family, has been</i>
<i>experiencing supernatural occurrences.</i>

654
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,080
你来
<i>Okay, go ahead.</i>

655
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,357
从头说
<i>From the first occurrence.</i>

656
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,029
Brad来了
Here's Brad.

657
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,440
没问题吧？
嗯
- You find it okay?
- Oh, yeah.

658
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,954
Drew，这位是Brad警官
Drew, this is Officer Brad.

659
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,675
警官 Brad Hamilton
Harrisville, Rhode Island P.D.
Officer Brad Hamilton,
Harrisville, Rhode Island P.D.

660
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,718
很高兴见到你
Hm. Nice to meet you, man.

661
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,710
你是那位运气超好的新警察？
我猜是吧
- So you're the lucky new cop, huh?
- Guess so.

662
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,038
你知道你不可能射中鬼魂，对吗？
有好一点儿，Drew
- You know you can't shoot ghosts, right?
- Take it easy on him, Drew.

663
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,431
大家过来帮我把这些东东卸下来
All right, guys,
help me get this stuff unloaded.

664
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,074
你拿这个
You take this.

665
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,390
嗨 Roger
Hi, Roger.

666
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,910
Drew你把这里弄完之后，就到楼上去。
All right. When you're finished here,
why don't you hit upstairs, all right, Drew?

667
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,275
没问题吧
You got it.

668
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,679
那辆雪佛来怎么了？
What's wrong with the Chevy?

669
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,272
坏了
Ugh, what's not wrong with her?

670
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,591
需要一个新的换油器
噢，是吗
- Needs a new carburetor to start.
- Oh, yeah?

671
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,872
先扔着吧，过一段时间再修理
Kind of put fixing her up
on hold for a while.

672
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,474
Yeah. Ahem.

673
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,511
Brad，麻烦递给我一个调温器。
Hey, Brad, hand me a thermostat,
would you?

674
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,150
这是什么东东？
What's this, uh, do?

675
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,478
如果温度急剧下降
When there's an instant drop
in temperature...

676
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,075
调温器可以触动相机的快门
...the thermostat
triggers the camera to take a picture.

677
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,557
你真的有拍摄到那些东西吗？
You've actually caught things on film?

678
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,520
嗯，当然
Well, yeah, that's, uh, the point.

679
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:26,232
为什么我们要在外边
Why, uh--? Why out here?

680
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:29,160
这里是女巫下咒的地方
Well, this is where the witch
committed suicide.

681
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,953
她就在站的那个地方上方的树杈上上吊死了
She hung herself from that branch
right above where you're standing.

682
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,312
多狠毒的妈妈才会把自己的孩子杀了
<i>How could a mother kill her own child?</i>

683
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,918
对她来说，那并不是她的孩子
It was never a child to her.

684
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:48,710
她只是在利用上帝赐给她的礼物来对抗圣灵
She just used her God-given gift
as the ultimate offense against him.

685
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,952
女巫们认为那会提高她们在撒旦眼中的地位
Witches believe it elevates their status
in the eyes of Satan.

686
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:01,870
噢
Mm.

687
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:05,511
哇哦，你们在海边的那天真是个美好的日子呀
Wow.
That's a nice day at the beach, huh?

688
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,478
你是怎么知道的？
How did you know?

689
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:12,197
这就是所谓的洞察力。就像掀开窗帘的一角去偷窥别人的生活一样。
It's an insight. It's like a peek through
the curtain into another person's life.

690
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,034
嗯
Mm.

691
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,440
对我来说，那是非常重要的一天。我们沿着海岸开了很久的车
That day meant so much to me.
We were driving along the coast.

692
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,195
Nancy说那里的风景好美
Nancy pointed out
how pretty the view was.

693
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,713
我觉得应该拍张家庭合影。
I thought this is a perfect opportunity
for a photo.

694
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,032
我们就要开始新的生活了。新的房子，新的开始。
<i>We're gonna start fresh, you know?</i>
<i>A new house, a new beginning.</i>

695
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,557
我从未见过Roger和女孩们那么地开心
<i>You should have seen Roger and the girls.</i>
<i>I've never seen them so happy.</i>

696
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,870
干杯～！
Cheese!

697
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,637
对我而言她们就是我的全部。
They mean the world to me.

698
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,072
把你的手放在桌子上
Put your hand flat on the desk.

699
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,438
拿开
Yeah, and take it off.

700
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,394
我们来看看
Here we go.

701
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,876
看到了吗
See?

702
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,396
它可以让我们看到一些我们平时看不到的东西
It just reveals to us what
the naked eye can't see.

703
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,080
非常先进，对吗
Pretty far out, isn't it?

704
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,679
对，很好玩
Yeah, it's groovy.

705
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,557
Drew， 你把Bolex准备好了吗？
Drew, you got the Bolex ready for Brad?

706
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,070
嗯，弄好了
Yeah, already locked and loaded, sir.

707
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,115
怎么了？我憋不住了
What? I had to go.

708
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,800
所有的房间都安装好了
All the rooms are coming in pretty good.

709
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,189
很好
Good.

710
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,154
瓶子里是什么？
What's in the bottle?

711
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:17,996
圣水
Holy water.

712
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,550
放一些宗教的标识
Presence of religious icons...

713
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,758
会刺激那些邪恶的东西
from anything unholy.

714
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,199
可以激怒它们
Sort of pisses them off.

715
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,991
我要把这些标识多放几个地方，看看会发生什么
So I set these throughout the house,
see if I can stir things up a bit.

716
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,669
就像在魔鬼面前拿着十字架？
太对了
- Like holding a cross to a vampire?
- Yeah. Exactly.

717
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,191
除了吸血鬼以外
Except I don't believe in vampires.

718
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,509
那不是我
Wasn't me.

719
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,520
Brad，拿着相机
Brad, get the camera.

720
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,430
好
Okay.

721
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:21,192
现在是9:18，我们正在去地窖，
All right, it's 9:18, we're headed down into the
cellar where the door's just opened on its own.

722
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,199
我和Lorraine、Brad Hamilton警官在一起
I have Lorraine and Officer Brad Hamilton
with me.

723
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,557
我们要关掉地窖的灯
Let's keep the cellar light off.

724
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:43,394
如果你想要和我们联系，就发个信号
Give us a sign that you wanna
communicate with us.

725
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,434
宝贝，你没事吧
Hon, you all right?

726
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,235
这里绝对有东西
There's definitely something here.

727
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,758
关上门，弄点儿动静出来
我的手好冷
- All right, close the door. Move something.
- My hands are so cold.

728
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,315
快点
Come on.

729
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,630
不
No.

730
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,439
它跑了。。
It's gone. It's gone.

731
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,120
什么都没有
I got nothing.

732
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,760
好吧
Okay.

733
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,797
就像我说过的，不一定总会成功。
Well, like I said, it doesn't always work
when you want it to.

734
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,755
也许相机会拍到点有用的东东
Yeah, maybe the camera picked
something up.

735
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,835
小心点儿
Watch out!

736
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,154
对于一个不相信这些东东的人而言
<i>For a guy who doesn't believe...</i>

737
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:17,677
那扇门撞上的时候你好象真有点儿吓着了
...you looked a little freaked out
when that door slammed shut.

738
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,597
那肯定是个draft（不知咋翻译）
It must have been a draft.

739
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,799
噢，那很好笑
Oh, that's funny.

740
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,915
A draft never put that look
on my face before.

741
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,353
我相信那个钟表
I believe the clock.

742
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,593
现在是3:08
It's 3:08.

743
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,359
让我看看你的眼镜
Let me see your glasses.

744
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,716
这是给你的
For you.

745
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:52,630
我想待会儿我可能会带几个女孩子去吃冰淇淋,你觉得怎么样?
I think I might take some girls for ice cream
later on. What do you say about that?

746
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,991
太好了
宝贝,你想要一起来吗
- Yeah!
- Honey, you wanna come?

747
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:58,198
不,我快累死了,我只想休息一下.
I'm exhausted. I'm just gonna take a nap.
The late nights are getting to me.

748
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,750
那是个好主意.你去休息吧
That's probably a good idea.
Why don't you get some rest.

749
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,555
Lorraine和我会照看这里
真的吗
- Lorraine and I'll watch over things for a bit.
- Really?

750
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:06,440
我先走了,一个小时之后就该轮到我值班了.
I'm gonna take off.
I have a shift starting in an hour.

751
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,751
这个房间里已经很久没有像今天这样热闹了
The house hasn't felt like this
in a long time.

752
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,873
我想有你们在这里,孩子们会觉得非常安全.
I think the kids feel a lot safer
with you around.

753
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,875
我可以习惯这个
什么?我洗衣服?
- I could get used to this.
- What, me doing laundry?

754
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,832
哈哈
真讨厌
- Ha-ha-ha.
- You're funny.

755
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,994
不是,我是说这个地方
No, this place.

756
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,471
很不错的地方,空气也很新鲜
Nice, fresh country air.

757
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,840
他们的家庭也非常美好
They have such a beautiful family,
don't they?

758
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,472
嗯,最小的那个,April,你有没有看到她那给我煎饼?
Yeah, that little one, April,
did you see her bring me pancakes?

759
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,513
我们必须要帮助他们
We've gotta help them.

760
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,400
我知道
I know.

761
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:50,069
我会从那个雪佛莱开始
- I'll start with the Chevy.
- Heh.

762
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,515
Carolyn
Carolyn!

763
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,596
你还好吗
Are you okay?

764
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:16,910
Carolyn,开门
Carolyn, open the door.

765
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,150
Carolyn,快开门
Carolyn, open up!

766
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,196
你还好吗
Are you okay?

767
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:27,635
我没事
你是不是生病了
- Oh, I'm fine.
- Are you sick?

768
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,634
我醒来后觉得好恶心,再没什么事
我觉得我好像看到...
- I woke up feeling nauseous, that's all.
- I thought I saw--

769
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,031
我听到Roger和女孩们
I hear Roger and the girls.

770
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,270
等一下
One minute.

771
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,637
大家想要玩游戏们?
无聊
- Guys, do you wanna play a game?
- Boring!

772
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:49,916
谢谢你爸爸
Thank you, Daddy.

773
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,350
我们进去吧
Let's go inside.

774
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,790
我以为那是你
I thought that was you.

775
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,195
希望你不要介意
Hey, I hope you don't mind.

776
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,040
我有个好主意.
I got a good deal on a rebuild
at that wrecking yard in Smithfield.

777
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:05,278
你看起来好像知道你在做什么
嗯,等着瞧
- No, you look like you know what you're doing.
- Yeah, we'll see.

778
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,879
Roger,这个地方真不错
Got a nice place here, Roger.

779
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,390
Lorraine和我一直想要这样的地方
Lorraine and I always wanted
a spot in the country.

780
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,880
我会把这个卖给你
I'll sell you this one.

781
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,594
把扳手递给我
Hey, hand me a wrench, would you?

782
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:24,678
你待在这里对我们来说真的意味着很多
Hey, uh, it really means a lot
to us to have you here.

783
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:27,912
我必须要承认,我有点儿害怕进去那里
I gotta admit, I was a little
bit skeptical going in.

784
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,272
只是想要谢谢你
Just wanna say thank you, though,
for coming out when you did.

785
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,676
其实都是Lorraine的主意
I can't take the credit.
That's, uh-- That's all Lorraine.

786
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,594
那时我并不想来
为什么?
- I didn't want to.
- Oh. Why's that?

787
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,311
Lorraine看到的,感觉到的,接触过的,都可以帮助别人.
Whatever Lorraine sees, feels, touches,
it helps people.

788
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,597
但是她也因此受到了伤害
But it also takes a toll on her.

789
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,194
每次一点点
Little piece each time.

790
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,880
几个月之前,我们正在处理一个案子
Couple months ago
we were working on a case.

791
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,159
她看见了某种东西
She saw something.

792
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,194
那次她受到了很大的伤害
It took a real big piece.

793
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,634
我们回到家以后
When we got home...

794
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,833
她把自己锁进房子里
...she went into our room,
locked herself in...

795
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,834
不说话,不吃东西,整整8天都没有出门
...didn't talk, didn't eat,
didn't come out for eight days.

796
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,120
她看到了什么
What'd she see?

797
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,309
走开
Get out of here!

798
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,629
我不知道
I don't know.

799
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,799
我也没有问
And I won't ask.

800
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:54,552
我去找点儿吃的,你想要点儿吗
I need to reload. You want some?

801
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,554
我不要,谢谢
I'm good, thanks.

802
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,675
好吧
All right.

803
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,232
看看她让我都干了些什么
Look what she made me do.

804
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:31,230
看看她让我都干了些什么
Look what she made me do.

805
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,275
Hey.

806
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:43,756
Ed?
Ed?

807
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,155
看看她让我都干了些什么
Look what she made me do!

808
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,953
Ed!
Ed!

809
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,829
Ed!
Ed!

810
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,155
兄弟,你没事吧
Dude, you okay?

811
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:54,800
坚持住,Brad,发生什么事了
Hold up, Brad. What's going on?

812
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,873
我看到了一个女人,打扮得像个女仆
I saw someone. There was
a woman dressed as a maid.

813
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,517
Ed,有动静了
Ed? Ed, we're getting something.

814
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,634
那是Cindy,她在梦游
等等,我们需要这个
- It's just Cindy. She's sleepwalking.
- No, wait. We need this.

815
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,359
为什么我们要拍Cindy的照片
Why do we need pictures of Cindy?

816
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,834
她没有碰到机关
She didn't trigger it.

817
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,311
你什么意思?
有人和她在一起
- What do you mean she didn't trigger it?
- Somebody's with her.

818
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,630
谁?
Who?

819
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:28,914
Cindy!
Cindy!

820
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,915
Cindy!
Cindy!

821
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,080
Cindy!
Cindy!

822
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,879
过来这里,这里很安全
Hey, over here. It's safe.

823
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,918
那里有其他人和她在一起
There's someone else in there with her.

824
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,510
我听到别人的声音,你听~~
I'm hearing another voice. Here, listen.

825
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,516
跟着我,来这边
Follow me. This way.

826
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,798
我就藏在这里
<i>This is where I hide.</i>

827
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,189
Cindy!
Cindy?

828
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,040
Cindy!
Cindy?

829
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,030
她要去哪里?
Where'd she go, Ed?

830
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,033
窗户是锁着的
Windows are locked.

831
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,037
Ed,她去了哪里?
Ed, where'd she go?

832
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:22,914
Brad,打开紫外线灯
Brad, get the UV light.

833
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:25,231
什么?
问Drew.
- The what?
- Just ask Drew.

834
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:29,159
Drew,我需要紫外线灯
- Drew, I need a UV light.
- Uh--

835
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,834
在这边来
Here, that's it. Go, go, go, go!

836
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:38,914
关掉灯
Turn off the light.

837
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,119
让开点
Get out of the way.

838
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,396
好
Okay.

839
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,194
拿着灯
Hit the lights!

840
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,760
找到她了
Found her.

841
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,436
Here we go.

842
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,271
抱好她
是的
- All right. You got her?
- Yeah.

843
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,038
Rory害怕的时候他就藏在这里
That's where Rory hides
when he's afraid.

844
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,753
宝贝,把April的音乐盒递给我一下
Hon? Could I have April's
music box, please?

845
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:27,560
Cindy怎么样?
她什么都不记得了
- How's Cindy?
- She doesn't remember a thing.

846
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:31,840
来,接着
Here you go.

847
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:33,875
谢谢
Thank you.

848
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:12,874
Lorraine!

849
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,189

Lorraine!
Lorraine!

853
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,760
Lorraine!
Lorraine!

854
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:35,640
是她让我做的
She made me do it.

855
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:39,280
She made me do it.
是她让我做的

856
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,600
是她让我做的
She made me do it.

857
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,356
Ed!
Ed!

858
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,358
Lorraine!
Come on! Lorraine!

859
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,316
Ed!
Ed!

860
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,873
Ed!我知道她做了什么
Ed, I know what she did.

861
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,640
我抓到你了,我知道,没事
我知道她做了什么
- I got you. I know. It's okay.
- I know what she did.

862
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,713
我知道她做了什么.她迫使那些母亲杀死了孩子们
I know what she did. She possessed
the mother to kill the child.

863
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,394
她每天晚上都来找Carolyn
She visits Carolyn every night.

864
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:12,394
这就是那些伤痕的来源
That's what the bruise marks are!
She's feeding off of her!

865
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,079
Uh....

866
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,754
Nancy?
Nancy?

867
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:34,469
Nancy?
Nancy!

868
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,155
你没事吧
Are you okay?

869
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,080
Nancy?
Nancy!

870
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,636
抓住她
Grab her!

871
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:44,719
爸爸,救命
Daddy! Help!

872
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,670
Nancy?
Nancy!

873
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:54,990
她没事吧?
Is she okay?

874
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,395
没事了
It's okay, I got you.

875
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,596
你拍到那些了吗
Did you get that?

876
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,075
拍到了
Yeah.

877
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:07,233
我要把那些照片冲洗出来,带去给Gordon神父看
I'll have the footage developed
and get it over to Father Gordon.

878
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:11,394
他是我们在教堂的联络人,我想我们很快就会收到回复.
He's our liaison at the church.
I imagine we'll get a pretty fast response.

879
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:13,597
听着Roger
嗯?
- Listen, Roger?
- Yeah?

880
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,952
听着,我找到那些驱魔师会马上就回来,但是Lorraine
Listen, when we get the exorcist,
I'll be back. But Lorraine--

881
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:20,192
我明白
在Drew注意到你之前都要照顾好她
- Yeah, I understand.
- Until then Drew's gonna keep an eye on you.

882
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,716
Ed,谢谢你所做的一切
- Hey, Ed, thank you for everything.
- Yeah.

883
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:25,435
<i>Mommy?</i>
<i>Mommy?</i>

884
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,399
That's everything.

885
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:42,674
<i>Mommy?</i>
<i>Mommy?</i>

886
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,116
Judy?
Judy?

887
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:03,794
天哪
Oh, God!

888
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,076
Judy
Judy?

889
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,672
Lorraine,等等
Lorraine! Wait!

890
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,794
等一下,怎么了?
Lorraine. What?

891
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:20,314
妈妈,是我,Judy还好吗?
Mom, it's me. Is Judy okay?

892
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,949
什么?您能再去看一下吗
- What?
- Can you go check, please?

893
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,193
妈妈,就去看一下
Damn it, Mom, just check, please!

894
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:28,194
告诉我究竟发生什么事了
是Judy
- Are you gonna tell me what's going on?
- It's Judy.

895
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,874
什么?你是什么意思?
What? What do you mean?

896
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:31,996
什么?
What?

897
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,511
谢谢上帝
Oh, thank God.

898
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:39,358
对不起妈妈.我不是故意要吓你的,晚一点我会解释的.好吗
Mom, I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you. I'll explain later, okay?

899
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,320
发生什么事情了
What the hell happened?

900
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:45,951
我刚刚看到Judy在水里
I had a vision of Judy in the water.

901
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:48,396
我知道那是某种警告
I know it was some kind of warning.

902
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,120
我知道
I know it.

903
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,509
好吧
Okay.

904
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,880
走吧,我们离开这里
Let's get out of here.

905
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:46,349
然后呢?
你开玩笑的吧?
- So?
- Yeah, well, you weren't kidding.

906
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,590
没有
No.

907
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:52,553
听着Ed,这说起来有点儿复杂,因为那些孩子没有受过洗
Look, Ed, this is complicated
because the kids aren't baptized.

908
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,952
我明白
而且,这个家庭也不是我们教堂的成员
- No, I understand.
- And the family are not members of the church.

909
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,440
别说那个
- Oh, come on.
- And....

910
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:01,751
尤其是,这要得到罗马教会的直接批准
The approval would have to come
directly from the Vatican.

911
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:06,033
神父,我们从来没有见过这样的事
Father, we've never seen nothing like this.

912
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,640
是啊,我也没有
Yeah, well, neither have l.

913
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,238
神父,他们没有太多时间了
Father, they don't have a lot of time.

914
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,069
好吧
All right.

915
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,153
我会亲自督促这事儿.成吗?
I'll push it through myself.

916
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,277
谢谢你神父
谢谢你
- Thank you, Father. Thank you.
- Thank you.

917
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:33,753
我们等你电话
- All right, we'll wait for your call.
- Yeah.

918
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:39,711
妈妈,爸爸
Mommy? Daddy?

919
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:58,560
妈妈
Mommy?

920
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:00,400
爸爸
Daddy?

921
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,594
爸爸
Dad?

922
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,354
奶奶
Nanna?

923
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,000
奶奶
Nanna?

924
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,275
Aah!

925
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:41,834
奶奶
Nanna!

926
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:44,839
奶奶,救命
Nanna, help! Nanna, help!

927
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,036
Judy?
Judy?

928
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:50,558
奶奶

奶奶

Judy?,快开门
妈妈
- Judy, open the door!
- Mom!

932
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:00,352
Ed,这里有点儿不对劲
什么?
- Ed, there's something wrong.
- What?

933
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,630
奶奶
Nanna!

934
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,873
- Judy!
救命
- Judy!
- Help!

935
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,191
- Judy!- Judy!快开门
怎么了?
- Judy! Judy, open this door!
- What is it?

936
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:12,478
她出什么事了?- Judy!
- What's wrong with her? Judy!
躲开~~
- Hey, move. Move, move, move, move.

937
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:14,273
Judy, 退后
Judy, get back, honey. Get back!

938
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,154
快点儿
- Come on!
- Hurry.

939
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,792
救命
Help! Help!

940
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,079
离们远一点,Judy, 
Get away from the door, Judy!

941
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:25,958
Aah!

942
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,793
天哪,你还好吗
Oh, God! Are you okay?

943
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:32,034
有人拿着Annabelle玩偶坐在椅子里
There was someone rocking
in the chair with Annabelle.

944
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,236
什么
What?

945
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:40,709
没事了
It's okay.

946
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,074
她仍然很害怕
She's still in the case.

947
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:05,916
没事了
It's okay.

948
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:08,759
没事了～～
It's okay. It's okay.

949
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,670
爸爸～～
- Dad! Dad!
- Daddy!

950
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:19,196
爸爸～妈妈刚刚和Christine、 April一起离开了
Dad! Dad! Mom just left
with Christine and April.

951
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,795
我什么都没说，直接开车就走了。我不知道发生什么事了
She went in the car and drove away.
I don't know what happened.

952
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,515
她的身上全是腐肉的味道。
她也没有说除了上面事
- She smells like rotting meat.
- She didn't say what was going on.

953
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:28,276
什么？她走了？去哪儿了
走了，我不知道她去了哪里
- What do you mean, she left? Left where?
- Gone! I don't know where she was going.

954
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:35,359
妈妈～我们要去哪里？
Where are we going, Mom?

955
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,235
你好，我是Roger
- Hello?
<i>- It's Roger.</i>

956
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:46,760
Carolyn出事了
<i>Something's going on with Carolyn.</i>

957
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,794
Andrea说她带着Christine 和 April走了
Andrea was here,
said Carolyn took off with Christine and April.

958
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:52,714
女孩们说她的味道闻起来怪极了。。
胁迫母亲。。。。
<i>- The girls said she smelled like rotten meat.</i>
- Possesses the mother...

959
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,634
杀害自己的孩子。。她会把女孩们带回家去
...to kill the child, that's what she does.
She's taking them to the house.

960
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,632
Roger，马上回家。我们在那里碰面
Roger, get back to the house now.
I'll meet you.

961
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:01,237
锁上们，拉上窗帘。离电话远点儿
Lock the door, close the blinds.
Stay off the phone!

962
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,595
快去
Go.

963
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,713
我和你一起去
不行，你和Judy待在一起
- I'm coming.
- No, you stay with Judy.

964
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:13,310
保护Judy的唯一办法就是让这个破事儿早点结束
Only way to protect Judy
is if we stop this where it started.

965
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:16,598
否则，它会再次骚扰我们
这就是我的目的。
- Otherwise, she'll latch onto us again.
- That's exactly why I am going.

966
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,395
我不能让你一个人去面对那个女巫。
You think I'm gonna let you walk
into this alone?

967
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:21,400
我不能没有你。
I can't lose you.

968
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,229
你不会失去我。
You won't.

969
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,073
我们一起去，让这一切都结束吧。
Let's finish this together.

970
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:47,594
门锁着
Carolyn!
- Agh! It's locked.
- Carolyn!

971
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:49,196
Roger!
Roger!

972
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,476
走开
Get out of the way!

973
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:58,359
Roger!
- Ed!
- Roger!
- Ed!

974
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,113
- Carolyn!
- Ed!
- Carolyn!
- Ed!

975
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:02,555
- Carolyn!
- Carolyn!
我们下来了
- We're down here!

976
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:05,554
Carolyn,不要～～
Carolyn, don't!
No, no! She's got--!

977
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,837
抓着她的手，拿剪刀来
Get her hand! Get the scissors!

978
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,436
我们要把她弄到车里去
带她去哪里？
- We gotta get her to the car!
- And bring her where?

979
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:23,597
去找牧师
To take her to the priest
for the exorcism.

980
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:25,154
April在哪儿
April
- Where's April?
- April?

981
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:28,795
April
April!

982
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:31,676
把Christine带去车子里，找到April
Take Christine to the car and find April!

983
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:32,916
April
April!

984
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:35,355
快点
Come on!

985
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:47,751
她不会让Carolyn离开这座房间
你说什么？
- She won't let her leave the house.
- What do you mean?

986
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:50,310
她一旦离开这所房子，女巫就会杀死她
- If we take her out, the witch will kill her.
- Agh!

987
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:59,674
Roger!
Roger!

988
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,194
Carolyn!
Carolyn!

989
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:02,596
快
Go!

990
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:03,830
Carolyn!
Carolyn?

991
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:11,431
先把你房子这里
Okay, I'm gonna put you in here.
Come on.

992
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,240
进去，待在车子里
我不想一个人待在这里
- Get in. Stay in here.
- I don't wanna stay here by myself.

993
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,198
不管发生什么事，都要待在这里。我很快回来
Stay in here no matter what.
I'll be back.

994
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:18,795
我必须要找到April，好吗？我很快就回来，我保证
I have to find April, okay?
I'll be back, I promise.

995
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:22,910
April?
April?

996
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:27,109
你还好吗？
You okay?

997
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:33,269
不要～
Stop!

998
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,831
Brad!
Brad! Brad!

999
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:44,279
Aah!

1000
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:54,472
找个东西把她绑起来
Let's get something to tie her up!

1001
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,434
拽着点儿
Hold it.

1002
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:16,914
我要打电话给Gordon神父，他必须要过来这里
I gotta call Father Gordon.
We gotta get him out here.

1003
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:19,436
他离这里太远了。
看看她，，我想她已经坚持不住了。
He's too far away.
She won't make it. Look at her.

1004
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:32,515
那么你必须要离开
你在说什么？
- Then you need to leave.
- What are you talking about?

1005
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:34,797
我必须要开始驱魔
I have to do it. The exorcism.

1006
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:38,193
什么？我以为你说我们需要一个神父，你又不是神父
What? I thought you said we
need a priest. You're not a priest.

1007
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,835
你难道还有更好的主意？
他可以做到。
- Well, you got a better idea?
- He can do it.

1008
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:44,116
你可以做到
但是你必须要离开这里
- You can do it.
- But you gotta get out of here.

1009
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:47,876
我不会离开你
如果你待在这里，我是不会做这种事儿的。
- I'm not leaving you!
- Damn it, I'm not doing this with you in here!

1010
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:52,952
上帝让我们在一起，是有原因的。
这个就是原因
God brought us together for a reason.
This is it.

1011
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,559
我去拿书
I'm gonna get the book.

1012
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:13,514
April!
April!

1013
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,754
April!
April!

1014
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:49,110
以圣父、圣子以及圣灵的名义
"In the name of the Father,
the Son, the Holy Spirit."

1015
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:29,950
April!
April!

1016
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:31,951
抓好
Hold her still! Hold her still!

1017
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,873
过来这边，把她抓好了
Come here! Hold her still!

1018
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:43,949
April!
April?

1019
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:51,876
April!
April!

1020
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:53,599
April，你在下面吗？
April, you under there?

1021
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,070
April!
April!

1022
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:04,713
Carolyn，Carolyn，不要屈服！不要让她带走你
Carolyn. Carolyn. Don't give in!
Don't let her take you!

1023
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:06,957
Ed!停下来，你会杀死她的。快停止
Ed! You gotta stop,
you're killing her. Stop!

1024
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:08,474
不，他不能停止
No, he can't!

1025
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:13,320
Roger,救救我
Roger, help me!

1026
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:20,232
Ed! 妈的，快停下
Ed! Goddamn it, stop it!

1027
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,835
明白了吗，我们在拯救她的灵魂
Understand this! We are
now fighting for her soul!

1028
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,232
以耶稣基督、所有的天使和圣人的名义
"In the name of Jesus Christ,
the saints and all the angels...

1029
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:28,511
我命令你，马上停止作恶。。。
...I command you to reveal yourself!"

1030
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,480
Roger,
Roger, help me!

1031
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:53,120
放她下来
Put her down!

1032
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,275
放她下来
Put her down!

1033
01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:58,550
放她下来
Put her down!

1034
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:01,635
Carolyn!
Carolyn!

1035
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,155
Carolyn!
Carolyn!

1036
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:07,991
Ed,小心
- Ed, look out!
- Unh!

1037
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:12,954
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

1038
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:16,917
抓紧她，别让她起来
Hold her still! Don't let her up!

1039
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:18,480
我们失去她了，Roger!
We're losing her, Roger!

1040
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:21,195
该死的，离我家人远一点，听到了吗
Damn you! You leave my family alone,
you hear me?

1041
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:24,000
我不知道你是个什么东西，但是离我妻子远一点。
I don't know what you are, but you leave
my wife alone, goddamn it!

1042
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:27,153
放开她
听到了吗？放开她
Let her go!
Do you hear me? Let her go!

1043
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:31,950
放开她
Let her go, goddamn it! Let her go!

1044
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:40,471
她已经死了
She's already gone.

1045
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,317
现在，你们全部都要死
And now you're all gonna die.

1046
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:51,870
April!
April!

1047
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:55,920
我找到她了。她在厨房下面
I found her! She's under the house!
Under the kitchen!

1048
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:58,510
别
Don't! No!

1049
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,680
抓住她
Get her!

1050
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:16,514
这边，
Carolyn!
- Here.
- Carolyn!

1051
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:21,397
Carolyn!
她在那边的洞里。
- Carolyn!
- She's in that hole. Right there.

1052
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,117
Carolyn!，天哪，不要～～
Carolyn? Oh, my God. No!

1053
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:29,000
我进不去，够不到她
Can't go in. Can't reach.

1054
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:30,669
不要，Carolyn!不要～～
No! Carolyn, don't!

1055
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:34,400
不要
Carolyn, no!

1056
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:36,558
Bathsheba!

1057
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:42,960
以上帝的力量，我命令你回到地狱吧
By the power of God,
I condemn you back to hell!

1058
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,920
这是你的女儿
This is your daughter!

1059
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:51,754
你不能屈服
- You can't give in!
- Agh!

1060
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:54,151
Roger.，我们要让她自己和女巫抗争
to fight from the inside.

1061
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:56,880
不要让她这样做
Don't let her do this.
Don't let this thing do this.

1062
