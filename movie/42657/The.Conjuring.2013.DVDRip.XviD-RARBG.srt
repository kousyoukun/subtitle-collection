1
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:26,796
It scares us just thinking about it.

2
00:00:26,973 --> 00:00:29,032
When you hear it, you're gonna
think we're insane.

3
00:00:29,209 --> 00:00:31,905
Try us. Please, from the start.

4
00:00:34,147 --> 00:00:39,141
It started out small, like a hand
or a leg was in a different position.

5
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:41,810
Then its head was looking up
instead of down.

6
00:00:41,988 --> 00:00:45,014
And then one day, it was in
a completely different room.

7
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:46,716
It was moving around by itself.

8
00:00:46,893 --> 00:00:51,057
Ever think maybe somebody had a key
to your apartment and was playing a trick?

9
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:52,926
That's exactly what we thought.

10
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:56,095
But never once did we find any
sign or evidence of intrusion.

11
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:59,030
And this all led you to believe
that the doll was possessed?

12
00:00:59,172 --> 00:01:00,537
Yes.

13
00:01:00,707 --> 00:01:04,438
Camilla got in touch with a medium. We
learned from her that a 7-year-old girl...

14
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:07,512
...named Annabelle Higgins
had died in this apartment.

15
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:11,378
She was lonely and took a liking
to my doll.

16
00:01:12,018 --> 00:01:13,952
All she wanted was to be friends.

17
00:01:14,154 --> 00:01:16,452
When we heard this,
we felt really sorry for her.

18
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:19,250
I mean, we're nurses, we help people.

19
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:20,785
So...

20
00:01:21,928 --> 00:01:24,396
...we gave her permission
to move into the doll.

21
00:01:24,564 --> 00:01:26,555
Wait, you did what?

22
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:29,367
She wanted to live with us
by inhabiting the doll.

23
00:01:29,536 --> 00:01:30,696
We said yes.

24
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:33,305
But then things got worse.

25
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,617
God.

26
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:54,654
When we came home,
she was sitting in the hallway.

27
00:01:54,828 --> 00:01:57,228
But we had left her in the spare room.

28
00:02:35,135 --> 00:02:37,228
Debbie! Debbie, wait!

29
00:03:52,112 --> 00:03:54,046
We are beyond terrified.

30
00:03:54,214 --> 00:03:58,173
We don't know what's going on
or what to do. Can you help us?

31
00:03:59,252 --> 00:04:00,810
Yes, we can.

32
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:05,282
Now, firstly, there's no such thing
as Annabelle, and there never was.

33
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,517
Ghosts don't possess such power.

34
00:04:07,694 --> 00:04:10,322
I think what we have here is something
extremely manipulative.

35
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:12,431
It's something inhuman.

36
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:15,130
It was a big mistake
acknowledging this doll.

37
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:17,429
And through that,
the inhuman spirit tricked you.

38
00:04:17,604 --> 00:04:20,368
You gave it permission
to infest your lives.

39
00:04:20,874 --> 00:04:22,739
What's an inhuman spirit?

40
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:26,777
It's something that's never walked
the earth in human form.

41
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:29,078
It's something demonic.

42
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:35,046
So the doll was never possessed?

43
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:37,155
No, no, it was used as a conduit.

44
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:39,656
It was moved around to give
the impression of possession.

45
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:43,455
Demonic spirits don't possess things,
they possess people.

46
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:46,725
It wanted to get inside of you.

47
00:04:56,076 --> 00:04:59,512
All right, that's good, Drew.
You can shut it down now.

48
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:02,307
Hit the lights.

49
00:05:05,318 --> 00:05:07,411
So we got the church to
send a priest over...

50
00:05:07,587 --> 00:05:09,646
...to bless the house and the occupants.

51
00:05:09,823 --> 00:05:13,486
Whatever was oppressing that apartment
was no longer with them. Any questions?

52
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:16,653
Yes.

53
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,457
Where's the doll now?

54
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:20,395
Someplace safe.

55
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:23,827
- Yep.
- So, what are you guys?

56
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:25,835
I mean, what do people call you?

57
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:31,768
Uh, well, we've been called Demonologists.
That's one name for us.

58
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:33,640
Ghost hunters, paranormal researchers.

59
00:05:33,813 --> 00:05:36,111
- Kooks.
Ha-ha-ha.

60
00:05:36,282 --> 00:05:37,681
Wackos.

61
00:05:37,851 --> 00:05:42,049
But we prefer to be known simply
as Ed and Lorraine Warren.

62
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:44,105
Here we are.

63
00:06:47,787 --> 00:06:49,721
Wow, hear that?

64
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:51,516
- I don't hear anything.
- Exactly.

65
00:06:51,691 --> 00:06:52,885
Oh. Ha!

66
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:56,358
- Okay. Guys, we are here!
- Get out of the car.

67
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:58,394
Oh, God, we're in the middle of nowhere.

68
00:06:58,565 --> 00:07:01,591
Are you so excited? Where's my "yes"?
Where's my "yes"? Yes!

69
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:02,860
I'll race you!

70
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:05,300
- Are you guys excited?
- Yes!

71
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:07,473
- I'm so excited!
- Come on, Sadie!

72
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,130
I get my own room!

73
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:11,971
Are you kidding me?
No dibs on the rooms!

74
00:07:12,145 --> 00:07:13,237
- What?
- What?

75
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:17,144
So do I get to pick my own room?
Or do I have no choice in that either?

76
00:07:19,652 --> 00:07:22,985
Well, first cute boy she meets,
she'll forget about Jersey.

77
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:24,384
- Great.
- I hope.

78
00:07:24,557 --> 00:07:25,751
I can't wait.

79
00:07:26,392 --> 00:07:27,620
Come on, Sadie.

80
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:30,118
Sadie, let's go.

81
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:32,758
Hey, come.

82
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:35,491
What's the matter with you?

83
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:37,397
Hey, come on, girl.

84
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:40,136
All right, suit yourself.

85
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,377
- What's your name?
- What's your name?

86
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:51,414
- Who's your daddy?
- Who's your daddy?

87
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:53,245
- He rich?
- Is he rich like me?

88
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:54,511
Watch your step.

89
00:07:54,687 --> 00:07:56,120
Coming through.

90
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,014
Whoa, watch out, Dad.

91
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:00,071
- Where do you want it?
- In the living room.

92
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:03,193
- Andrea, where's my wind chime?
- I think Nancy's got it in the other room.

93
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:05,493
Thanks. Hey, Nancy,
have you seen my wind chime?

94
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:07,292
- Oh, this one?
- Yeah, thanks.

95
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:10,300
- You're gonna have to catch it.
- Nancy! Let go! Give it here.

96
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:12,328
You're so mean.

97
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:15,102
Hey, Mom, can I hang up
my wind chime?

98
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:17,709
Of course. There's a line outside
you can hang it on.

99
00:08:17,877 --> 00:08:20,505
Honey, have April come in, okay?
It's gonna be dark soon.

100
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,942
Okay.

101
00:08:30,957 --> 00:08:34,154
Come on, April! Mom wants us inside!

102
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:36,989
Look what I found, Cindy.

103
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:57,980
One...

104
00:08:58,518 --> 00:08:59,542
...two...

105
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:00,811
...three.

106
00:09:00,987 --> 00:09:02,852
Come on, come on, come on.
No peeking.

107
00:09:03,022 --> 00:09:04,421
Four.

108
00:09:04,624 --> 00:09:07,684
Are you guys done with the pizza?
I don't want it going to waste.

109
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:10,329
- Let's go.
- It's expensive feeding you girls.

110
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:13,863
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

111
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:15,193
Where should I hide?

112
00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:17,526
Ready or not, here I come!

113
00:09:19,072 --> 00:09:20,334
Okay, clap.

114
00:09:28,781 --> 00:09:30,874
- Whoa!
- You don't know the house well enough.

115
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,074
Someone's gonna get hurt.

116
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:33,549
I'm okay, I'm okay.

117
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:36,854
Second clap.

118
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:44,360
That's cheating.

119
00:09:56,976 --> 00:09:58,238
Clap.

120
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:02,178
- Got you!
- Aah!

121
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:04,774
- Are you okay? Um...
- Yeah.

122
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:06,852
All right, what did we break now?

123
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,011
- I didn't mean to.
- Move out of there, please.

124
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:10,917
It was Christine's fault.

125
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,285
- Oh, jeez.
- My fault? Oh, my God.

126
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:15,379
- Christine did it.
- No, I didn't.

127
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:17,723
- You pushed me.
- No, no, you fell back.

128
00:10:17,897 --> 00:10:20,559
Hey, Nancy, can you go get me
the matches, please?

129
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:22,593
What's going on?

130
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:24,760
- Nancy broke something.
- Shut up.

131
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:26,769
- What broke?
- It's the wall.

132
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,966
- Whoa.
- I think we have a cellar or something.

133
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,574
I wanna see, I wanna see. Move, move, move.

134
00:10:34,347 --> 00:10:36,838
Here, matches. Thank you.

135
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,051
- I wanna see.
- You can see.

136
00:10:39,218 --> 00:10:40,978
- I wanna see.
- You can all see.

137
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,348
Move!

138
00:10:52,532 --> 00:10:54,329
Oh, man.

139
00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:00,129
Huh.

140
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:03,203
Roger?

141
00:11:04,377 --> 00:11:05,639
What do you see down there?

142
00:11:06,512 --> 00:11:09,310
Just, uh, hard to tell, you know?

143
00:11:09,749 --> 00:11:13,446
It's an old piano
and a whole bunch of garbage.

144
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:17,986
Agh. Son of a...

145
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:23,256
Wow.

146
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,497
Rog?

147
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:33,270
Come on up.

148
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:38,204
I don't want you girls going down there.

149
00:11:38,378 --> 00:11:40,107
- That place is loaded with spiders.
- Ew!

150
00:11:40,313 --> 00:11:41,337
Just relax. Okay.

151
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:43,846
Stop it, Nancy. It's not funny.

152
00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:47,709
We've got extra square footage anyway.
I'll check it out in the morning.

153
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:50,048
- I wonder why it was boarded up.
- I don't know.

154
00:11:50,223 --> 00:11:51,281
Okay, show's over.

155
00:11:51,457 --> 00:11:53,177
- Five minutes.
- No more minutes.

156
00:11:53,326 --> 00:11:55,658
- Up to bed. Please. Thank you.
- Right to bed.

157
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:01,197
Man, I'm fried.

158
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:03,729
Something's up with Sadie.

159
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:07,866
Yeah, I don't know what her problem is.
Couldn't get her to come inside.

160
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:09,833
We can't leave her out there.

161
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:12,170
She's all right. I got her on a chain.

162
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:16,210
Sadie, hey, be quiet.

163
00:12:19,218 --> 00:12:21,209
Thanks for making this work.

164
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:23,252
I know it was a lot to bite off.

165
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,581
It's gonna be great, isn't it?

166
00:12:27,193 --> 00:12:29,024
I think it's great already.

167
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:31,387
Yeah.

168
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:36,264
You still too fried to christen
the new house?

169
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:38,703
Who said I'm fried?

170
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:42,306
- Ain't nobody here's fried.
- Ha, ha.

171
00:13:17,677 --> 00:13:18,871
Mom?

172
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:21,473
Hey. How did you guys sleep?

173
00:13:21,647 --> 00:13:22,841
I'm cold.

174
00:13:23,015 --> 00:13:24,505
It is chilly, isn't it?

175
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:28,514
You think maybe we could have bought
a house with a toilet that actually works?

176
00:13:28,688 --> 00:13:29,712
Tell your father.

177
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:32,983
And there was a funky smell in my
room last night. Like something died.

178
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,751
- Is it still there?
- No.

179
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:35,951
Problem solved.

180
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:02,814
Roger?

181
00:14:04,423 --> 00:14:05,788
Roger?

182
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:07,692
Down here, honey.

183
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:13,923
Morning.

184
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:18,166
Ooh. Whoa.

185
00:14:18,337 --> 00:14:20,999
This is gonna take some
serious elbow grease.

186
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:22,334
Yeah.

187
00:14:23,376 --> 00:14:25,139
Oh, my God.

188
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:33,916
What are we gonna do
with all this stuff?

189
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:36,520
Well, we probably ought
to go through it, you know?

190
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:39,055
There might be some antiques down here
worth a lot.

191
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:41,921
Yeah, or just a lot of junk
the previous owner didn't want.

192
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:44,386
- It's ours now.
- Knock yourself out.

193
00:14:45,097 --> 00:14:47,031
- I'm gonna make some coffee.
- Okay.

194
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,259
I'm gonna see if I can get
this furnace working.

195
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:51,198
Yeah, that'd be nice. It's freezing.

196
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,496
Yeah.

197
00:15:01,547 --> 00:15:03,139
Hmm.

198
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:08,315
Sadie! Come here, Sadie!

199
00:15:08,654 --> 00:15:09,916
Mommy!

200
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,557
Mommy, where's Sadie?

201
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:17,025
She's outside. You know, I'm sure she's hungry by now.
Why don't you go and get her.

202
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,054
- Whoa.
- Morning, Dad.

203
00:15:19,232 --> 00:15:21,223
- Can you hold this?
- Sure.

204
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,061
- Sadie!
- Slow it down, Scoot.

205
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:24,533
- Roger.
- Yeah.

206
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:27,832
This clock stopped at 3:07,
and so did the one in the hallway.

207
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:29,406
That's weird.

208
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,075
Maybe it got knocked around in the move.

209
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:36,113
Speaking of knocked around,
what did you do to me last night?

210
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:39,045
- Ouch. I didn't do that. Did I?
- I don't know.

211
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:41,618
Sadie!

212
00:15:51,364 --> 00:15:53,628
April! April!

213
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,393
What's...? April! What's going on?

214
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:58,867
- What happened?
- Oh, my God!

215
00:15:59,272 --> 00:16:00,705
Oh, Sadie.

216
00:16:10,783 --> 00:16:12,842
We keep everything locked in here.

217
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:15,049
Feel free to look around.

218
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:17,081
Just don't touch anything.

219
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,050
Wow.

220
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:23,785
This is crazy.

221
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:28,733
So all these are taken from cases
you've investigated?

222
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:32,837
That's right. Everything you see
in here is either haunted, cursed...

223
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:35,940
...or has been used in some kind
of ritualistic practice.

224
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:38,268
Nothing's a toy.

225
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:40,105
Not even the toy monkey.

226
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,979
Don't touch it.

227
00:16:45,184 --> 00:16:49,644
Oh, ahem. Well, isn't it scary,
or doesn't it worry you...

228
00:16:49,822 --> 00:16:52,120
...to have all these items
right in your home?

229
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:55,658
That's why we have a priest that comes by
once a month to bless the room.

230
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:57,056
Well, the way I see it is:

231
00:16:57,229 --> 00:16:59,857
It's safer for these things
to be in here than out there.

232
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:01,833
It's kind of like keeping guns
off the street.

233
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:05,061
Why not just throw them
in an incinerator? Destroy them.

234
00:17:05,237 --> 00:17:07,137
Well, that would only destroy the vessel.

235
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,438
Sometimes it's better to keep
the genie in the bottle.

236
00:17:11,711 --> 00:17:14,475
Say, is the, uh, Annabelle doll here?

237
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:17,780
Right this way.

238
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:21,349
Yeah.

239
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:32,562
- You said she's a conduit?
- That's right.

240
00:17:32,732 --> 00:17:33,960
What does that mean?

241
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:37,967
A very powerful demonic
has latched itself onto her.

242
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:41,072
So when you guys investigate
these hauntings...

243
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,470
...how do you stop them
from latching onto you?

244
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:45,200
We have to take great precaution.

245
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:47,005
But what about your wife?

246
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,211
What about her?

247
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:52,146
Well, Father Gordon told me that...

248
00:17:52,318 --> 00:17:53,808
Well, that was different.

249
00:17:54,353 --> 00:17:57,151
What happened to my wife
happened during an exorcism.

250
00:17:57,323 --> 00:17:58,984
Well, what's the difference?

251
00:18:00,793 --> 00:18:02,021
Excuse me.

252
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:05,057
Honey, what are you doing?

253
00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:06,691
Come here.

254
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:09,198
You know better. All right?

255
00:18:09,368 --> 00:18:10,801
Georgiana?

256
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,368
- Come on. Did you touch anything?
- No.

257
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:14,836
All right, come on, honey.

258
00:18:15,674 --> 00:18:18,234
- Georgiana! Could you take Judy upstairs?
- Oh, sure.

259
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:20,879
You can't go into this room,
no matter what, remember?

260
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:22,479
- Yes, Daddy.
- All right.

261
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:24,540
- Go on.
- Okay, come on.

262
00:18:24,717 --> 00:18:27,743
Let's see if I can find you
a little snack, okay? Come on.

263
00:18:35,995 --> 00:18:38,054
Hey. What's going on in here?

264
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,721
- Daddy, look.
- You look very pretty.

265
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,232
All right, all done.
Go get dressed for dinner.

266
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:46,235
- I'm wearing it to dinner.
- No, you're not!

267
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:48,635
Here you go.

268
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:50,705
How'd it go?

269
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:52,969
Oh, I think he may write
a positive article.

270
00:18:53,145 --> 00:18:55,079
Ooh, a non-skeptic.

271
00:18:55,648 --> 00:18:56,945
That's a pleasant change.

272
00:18:57,116 --> 00:18:58,276
Yeah.

273
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:06,920
Stop blaming yourself.

274
00:19:17,903 --> 00:19:19,302
No sugar.

275
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:21,929
Be right back.

276
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,698
Not funny, Nancy.

277
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:22,128
What?

278
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:24,870
Stop grabbing my foot.

279
00:20:25,104 --> 00:20:27,197
Shut up, I didn't do anything.

280
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,473
Yeah, right.

281
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,178
And stop farting.

282
00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:35,375
It really stinks.

283
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:39,306
Don't blame that on me. It's you. Pew.

284
00:22:55,621 --> 00:22:56,679
Dad?

285
00:22:56,855 --> 00:22:58,846
Andrea, what are you doing out of bed?

286
00:22:59,124 --> 00:23:00,318
What's that sound?

287
00:23:00,492 --> 00:23:04,394
It's Cindy. She's in my room.
She's sleepwalking again.

288
00:23:19,845 --> 00:23:21,972
I've never seen her do this before.

289
00:23:26,085 --> 00:23:28,519
I remembered you saying not
to wake her if she's like this.

290
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:30,587
No, we just put her back to bed.

291
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:33,257
Hey, hey. Sweetie. Shh.

292
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,421
Let's go back to bed.

293
00:23:46,605 --> 00:23:48,232
She's okay. Good night.

294
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:49,567
Night.

295
00:24:02,588 --> 00:24:05,716
She's sleepwalking again?
She hasn't done that for awhile.

296
00:24:06,391 --> 00:24:09,451
She ended up in Andrea's room too.
I think kind of freaked her out.

297
00:24:09,628 --> 00:24:12,222
- That's not good. What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

298
00:24:12,397 --> 00:24:14,922
- Honey, you got another bruise here.
- Hmm?

299
00:24:15,234 --> 00:24:16,565
Does that hurt?

300
00:24:18,537 --> 00:24:19,629
That's weird.

301
00:24:19,838 --> 00:24:22,739
I don't know. Will you do me a favor,
go see a doctor for that?

302
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:25,873
- Yeah, I will. Drive safe.
- Yeah.

303
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:27,739
- I love you.
- I love you too.

304
00:24:58,243 --> 00:24:59,335
Bye!

305
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:00,978
Love you!

306
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:05,011
- Cindy, you have your lunch?
- Yeah.

307
00:25:06,618 --> 00:25:08,643
Yes, I do.

308
00:25:08,821 --> 00:25:10,652
I miss Sadie a lot.

309
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:13,184
She was my best friend.

310
00:25:14,426 --> 00:25:16,291
You're my friend, right?

311
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:19,487
Yeah, let's play.

312
00:25:25,704 --> 00:25:28,400
- Who are you talking to?
- Rory.

313
00:25:28,807 --> 00:25:29,967
Rory?

314
00:25:30,342 --> 00:25:32,333
- He's my new friend.
- Oh, really?

315
00:25:32,511 --> 00:25:35,605
- Yeah, do you want to see him?
- Yeah. Uh-huh. How?

316
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:37,180
With this.

317
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:41,012
When the music stops, you see him
in the mirror standing behind you.

318
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,046
Okay.

319
00:25:43,222 --> 00:25:45,156
But you have to twist the key.

320
00:25:45,324 --> 00:25:46,518
Okay.

321
00:26:10,182 --> 00:26:11,672
- Boo, Mommy! Ha-ha!
- Oh!

322
00:26:12,184 --> 00:26:15,153
- April, you just gave me a heart attack.
- Got you!

323
00:26:16,088 --> 00:26:19,182
Well, okay, I guess Rory
doesn't want to see me, huh?

324
00:26:19,358 --> 00:26:20,586
Hmm. Oh, well.

325
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:22,417
Can we play hide-and-clap?

326
00:26:22,594 --> 00:26:24,858
Hide-and-cla...?
Oh, honey, I don't want to play.

327
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:28,659
- Please! Nobody ever lets me play.
- Okay, okay.

328
00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:33,566
Remember, you get to ask me
for three claps.

329
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:34,763
Okay.

330
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,171
One, two, three.

331
00:26:38,343 --> 00:26:39,935
- I'm gonna go hide now!
- Okay.

332
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:42,774
Four, five...

333
00:26:42,981 --> 00:26:45,848
...six, seven...

334
00:26:46,018 --> 00:26:48,350
...eight, nine...

335
00:26:48,987 --> 00:26:50,215
...ten!

336
00:26:52,925 --> 00:26:54,415
First clap!

337
00:27:13,946 --> 00:27:15,743
Ow. Shit.

338
00:27:15,914 --> 00:27:17,438
Second clap!

339
00:27:32,965 --> 00:27:35,297
April.

340
00:27:41,173 --> 00:27:42,731
April.

341
00:27:53,285 --> 00:27:55,947
Oh, I know where you're hiding.

342
00:27:56,154 --> 00:27:58,247
Give me the third clap.

343
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:08,265
I'm gonna get you now.

344
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:17,302
I can hear you breathing.

345
00:28:17,943 --> 00:28:19,308
April.

346
00:28:20,312 --> 00:28:21,745
April.

347
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:30,719
Ha, ha. You took your blindfold off. I win!

348
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:34,723
You weren't even warm, Mom.
I was in Christine and Nancy's room.

349
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:43,099
I gotta have some routes here,
or I'm gonna lose the insurance on the rig.

350
00:28:45,137 --> 00:28:47,731
That's like half of my rate, man.

351
00:28:49,408 --> 00:28:51,399
Yeah, okay.

352
00:28:52,511 --> 00:28:54,502
I'll, uh... Yeah, I'll take it.

353
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:55,976
Thank you.

354
00:28:58,683 --> 00:29:01,652
- What's the route?
- It's, uh, Florida.

355
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,516
It's a week turnaround. I start tomorrow.

356
00:29:05,323 --> 00:29:06,847
We'll get through this.

357
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,852
Yeah.

358
00:29:10,028 --> 00:29:11,359
Come on, let's go to bed.

359
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:39,246
Stop it, Nancy. It's not funny anymore.

360
00:29:39,424 --> 00:29:42,518
I'm trying to sleep,
please stop grabbing my feet.

361
00:31:26,865 --> 00:31:28,332
Nancy?

362
00:31:30,335 --> 00:31:31,859
Nancy?

363
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:36,001
What are you doing?

364
00:31:39,578 --> 00:31:40,909
Christine?

365
00:31:42,647 --> 00:31:43,705
Are you all right?

366
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,049
Do you see it?

367
00:31:49,854 --> 00:31:51,014
See what?

368
00:31:56,528 --> 00:31:58,587
There's someone behind the door.

369
00:31:58,797 --> 00:31:59,991
What?

370
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,196
There's someone standing over there.

371
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:09,666
I don't see anyone.

372
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:14,408
It's looking right at us.

373
00:32:23,822 --> 00:32:25,187
Nancy, don't! Nancy.

374
00:32:25,357 --> 00:32:27,791
No, no. Look. Look.

375
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:31,417
Look, there's no one here. See?

376
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:35,060
Ugh. It's that smell again.

377
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,561
Oh, my God.

378
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:41,205
It's standing right behind you.

379
00:32:56,988 --> 00:33:00,219
Christine?! Christine! Christine!

380
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:02,726
God, it won't op...

381
00:33:04,095 --> 00:33:05,995
- Christine!
- No! No! No!

382
00:33:06,164 --> 00:33:09,156
- What's going on? What happened?
- There was someone else in here!

383
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:10,391
- What?
- Where?

384
00:33:10,568 --> 00:33:13,867
By the door. It was behind the door.

385
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:16,564
Honey, there's nothing in here.
There's nobody in here.

386
00:33:16,741 --> 00:33:18,504
There was someone else in here!

387
00:33:18,677 --> 00:33:23,114
I was just sleeping, and then
I felt somebody grab my feet.

388
00:33:23,281 --> 00:33:25,613
So I thought it was Nancy.

389
00:33:25,784 --> 00:33:29,083
Well, honey, I'm pretty sure
that it was just a bad dream.

390
00:33:29,254 --> 00:33:31,814
No! It talked to me!

391
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:33,920
It said...

392
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:38,156
...that it wants my family dead.

393
00:33:45,203 --> 00:33:47,671
Mr. Winston!

394
00:33:48,206 --> 00:33:49,833
Winston? Winston?

395
00:33:50,175 --> 00:33:51,608
Get behind him.

396
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,434
Where you off to?

397
00:33:53,611 --> 00:33:56,045
I just gotta run to the store
for a few things.

398
00:33:57,449 --> 00:34:00,213
- Why do you even try?
- What? What do you mean?

399
00:34:00,418 --> 00:34:02,943
In 15 years have you
ever been able to lie to me?

400
00:34:04,189 --> 00:34:07,090
Father Gordon called. He's got
a case he wants us to look into.

401
00:34:07,258 --> 00:34:09,783
I said I'd go check it out myself.
Lorraine, myself.

402
00:34:09,961 --> 00:34:11,326
I'm going with you.

403
00:34:12,263 --> 00:34:14,527
I know you're worried
it's gonna happen again.

404
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,496
Yeah, I am. I really am.

405
00:34:20,238 --> 00:34:24,197
Maybe it's just time we take a break.
Write that book.

406
00:34:25,477 --> 00:34:28,207
Do you remember what you said to me
on our wedding night?

407
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,204
"Can we do it again?"

408
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:34,278
After that.

409
00:34:36,721 --> 00:34:40,521
You said that God brought us together
for a reason. Right?

410
00:34:40,759 --> 00:34:43,660
I'm pretty sure it's not to write a book.

411
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:47,992
I'm gonna get dressed.

412
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:53,630
We've isolated the
disturbances to the attic.

413
00:34:53,772 --> 00:34:55,133
I want you to listen for a second.

414
00:34:56,474 --> 00:34:57,532
Oh, my God, that's it.

415
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,609
Do it again, Ed.

416
00:35:02,514 --> 00:35:05,847
Right now it's just my weight. But you
take the water coming off the pipe...

417
00:35:06,017 --> 00:35:08,542
...combined with the wind coming
through the broken window...

418
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,080
...these boards are gonna expand
and rub against each other.

419
00:35:11,222 --> 00:35:15,022
You heard it all through the house because
of these pipes leading to the radiator.

420
00:35:15,193 --> 00:35:17,093
So this place isn't haunted?

421
00:35:17,262 --> 00:35:18,889
No, it rarely is.

422
00:35:19,063 --> 00:35:22,863
Yeah, there's usually always
some kind of rational explanation.

423
00:36:05,143 --> 00:36:07,737
Girls, it's way past your bedtime.

424
00:38:04,862 --> 00:38:06,295
Who is that?

425
00:39:08,726 --> 00:39:11,286
Who's ever down there,
I'm gonna lock you in now!

426
00:39:11,963 --> 00:39:12,987
Aah! Unh.

427
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,104
Aah!

428
00:40:05,183 --> 00:40:06,707
Help!

429
00:40:06,884 --> 00:40:08,681
Andrea! Help!

430
00:40:33,377 --> 00:40:35,777
Hey, wanna play hide-and-clap?

431
00:40:38,983 --> 00:40:40,644
Aah!

432
00:41:10,515 --> 00:41:11,709
Cindy?

433
00:41:26,531 --> 00:41:28,362
Okay, now...

434
00:41:29,634 --> 00:41:30,862
All right?

435
00:41:31,235 --> 00:41:32,634
All right, come on.

436
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:34,198
Come on.

437
00:41:35,173 --> 00:41:36,470
There you go.

438
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:40,442
Okay, you can just sleep with me tonight,
all right?

439
00:41:45,316 --> 00:41:46,681
There you go.

440
00:41:48,052 --> 00:41:49,212
There.

441
00:42:52,884 --> 00:42:55,284
- Andrea?
- Help! Help! Help!

442
00:42:57,521 --> 00:42:59,079
- Who's in here?
- Andrea!

443
00:42:59,257 --> 00:43:01,452
Andrea? Andrea!

444
00:43:01,626 --> 00:43:02,752
In here!

445
00:43:02,927 --> 00:43:05,395
Help, Daddy! Help, it's Andrea!

446
00:43:05,563 --> 00:43:06,962
- Who's in here?
- Andrea!

447
00:43:07,465 --> 00:43:08,932
What happened?

448
00:43:11,102 --> 00:43:13,570
Somebody, goddamn it,
tell me what's going on here?

449
00:43:17,742 --> 00:43:22,611
Fear is defined as a feeling of agitation
and anxiety caused by the presence...

450
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,304
...or imminence of danger.

451
00:43:24,482 --> 00:43:28,976
Whether it's a ghost, a spirit
or an entity, they all feed on it.

452
00:43:29,153 --> 00:43:30,177
Take Maurice here.

453
00:43:30,354 --> 00:43:33,551
A French-Canadian farmer with
no more than a third-grade education...

454
00:43:33,724 --> 00:43:37,182
...yet after he was possessed, spoke
some of the best Latin I'd ever heard.

455
00:43:37,361 --> 00:43:38,623
Sometimes backwards.

456
00:43:38,796 --> 00:43:42,493
He'd been molested by his father,
who had also tortured him repeatedly.

457
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:46,133
A dark spirit made its home in this man.

458
00:43:46,304 --> 00:43:50,764
Now, if you look into his eyes,
you can see him tearing blood.

459
00:43:58,316 --> 00:43:59,715
And like that...

460
00:43:59,884 --> 00:44:04,082
...an upside-down cross started
to appear from within his body.

461
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:09,017
All right, Drew, you can hit the lights.

462
00:44:09,493 --> 00:44:10,517
Oh.

463
00:44:10,695 --> 00:44:13,061
Did you personally perform the exorcism?

464
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:16,063
No, I'm not authorized.
But I've assisted on many.

465
00:44:16,233 --> 00:44:18,167
See, an exorcism
can be very dangerous...

466
00:44:18,336 --> 00:44:21,362
...not only for the victim,
but for anyone in the room.

467
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:24,473
- What happened to Maurice?
- He tried to kill his wife...

468
00:44:24,742 --> 00:44:27,973
...but instead shot her in the arm
and then turned the gun on himself.

469
00:44:28,145 --> 00:44:31,581
Maurice had a very troubled life
with little to live for...

470
00:44:31,749 --> 00:44:34,650
...and not even an exorcist
could bring him back.

471
00:44:35,186 --> 00:44:38,212
Which brings us to the three stages
of demonic activity:

472
00:44:38,389 --> 00:44:40,584
Infestation, oppression and possession.

473
00:44:40,758 --> 00:44:42,157
Now, infestation:

474
00:44:42,326 --> 00:44:46,262
That's the whispering, the footsteps,
the feeling of another presence...

475
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:50,127
...which ultimately grows
into oppression, the second stage.

476
00:44:50,301 --> 00:44:52,542
Now this is where the victim,
and it's usually the one...

477
00:44:52,703 --> 00:44:54,568
...who's the most
psychologically vulnerable...

478
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:57,606
...is targeted specifically
by an external force.

479
00:44:57,775 --> 00:45:01,211
Breaks the victim down.
Crushes their will.

480
00:45:01,412 --> 00:45:06,645
And, once in a weakened state, leads them
to the third and final stage: possession.

481
00:45:09,787 --> 00:45:11,345
- Hey, Ed? Lorraine?
- Yeah.

482
00:45:11,522 --> 00:45:13,922
There's someone here
that would like to talk to you.

483
00:45:14,091 --> 00:45:15,115
- Hi.
- Thanks, Drew.

484
00:45:15,292 --> 00:45:16,759
- Thank you.
- I'll see you later.

485
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,019
How can we help you?

486
00:45:18,195 --> 00:45:22,529
There's something horrible happening in
my house. Could you come and take a look?

487
00:45:22,767 --> 00:45:24,598
You know, uh, it's getting kinda late.

488
00:45:24,769 --> 00:45:27,533
- We really need to head to our family.
- You don't understand.

489
00:45:27,705 --> 00:45:30,572
But we do. There's usually some
sort of rational explanation...

490
00:45:30,741 --> 00:45:35,474
I have five daughters who are scared to death.
I'm so afraid this thing wants to hurt us.

491
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:39,513
You have a daughter. Wouldn't you do
anything you could to protect her? Please.

492
00:45:39,683 --> 00:45:41,878
Please can you come and take a look?

493
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:44,584
Of course we will.

494
00:45:45,456 --> 00:45:46,946
Of course we will.

495
00:45:58,836 --> 00:46:00,997
Come on, Jan! Open up!

496
00:46:02,506 --> 00:46:03,905
Jan, what happened?

497
00:46:05,276 --> 00:46:06,837
The top of your head turned black.

498
00:46:07,011 --> 00:46:08,774
You guys straighten up? Thanks.

499
00:46:08,946 --> 00:46:10,743
Don't be silly, it's a wig.

500
00:46:14,718 --> 00:46:16,015
- Hello. Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

501
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,585
Thanks for coming.

502
00:46:18,355 --> 00:46:20,084
- Hi, I'm Roger.
- Lorraine.

503
00:46:20,257 --> 00:46:22,521
Hey, nice to meet you, Roger. Ed Warren.

504
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,991
- Thanks for coming.
- Please, come in.

505
00:46:25,162 --> 00:46:26,356
Thank you.

506
00:46:27,965 --> 00:46:28,989
So...

507
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:32,158
Oh, my God. Look at you all.
Who are these beautiful young women?

508
00:46:32,336 --> 00:46:35,703
This is Andrea, the oldest,
Nancy, Cindy, Christine...

509
00:46:35,873 --> 00:46:37,465
...and April.

510
00:46:39,176 --> 00:46:40,643
It's Mr. and Mrs. Warren.

511
00:46:41,245 --> 00:46:43,873
- We're all sleeping down here now.
- Mm.

512
00:46:44,348 --> 00:46:47,112
The girls feel safer and it's warmer.

513
00:46:47,485 --> 00:46:50,977
I'm constantly turning up the heat,
but the house is always freezing.

514
00:46:51,155 --> 00:46:53,055
It's not a problem with the furnace.

515
00:46:53,224 --> 00:46:54,486
I mean, not that I can find.

516
00:46:59,763 --> 00:47:03,494
It's gotten a lot
worse the past few nights.

517
00:47:04,034 --> 00:47:09,370
There's this awful smell, like rotting meat.
It moves around the house.

518
00:47:12,343 --> 00:47:13,401
Uh...

519
00:47:13,577 --> 00:47:14,805
What? What is it?

520
00:47:15,513 --> 00:47:20,849
Well, rancid smells could indicate
some type of demonic activity.

521
00:47:21,085 --> 00:47:22,177
Oh, my God.

522
00:47:26,624 --> 00:47:28,888
That's to keep those doors
from banging at night.

523
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:32,495
All night long, just like that.

524
00:47:33,864 --> 00:47:35,991
- Does it come in threes?
- Yeah.

525
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:37,327
It stops at dawn?

526
00:47:37,902 --> 00:47:39,130
Uh-huh.

527
00:47:41,105 --> 00:47:44,370
Well, sometimes it's meant
as an insult to the Trinity:

528
00:47:44,542 --> 00:47:46,510
The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

529
00:47:48,212 --> 00:47:51,841
You know, it's the damndest thing,
but we also get all kinds of birds...

530
00:47:52,016 --> 00:47:54,985
...that will just fly against the side
of the house and break their necks.

531
00:47:55,152 --> 00:47:56,779
Hm. Really?

532
00:47:56,954 --> 00:47:59,388
And the clocks stop at 3:07 a.m.

533
00:47:59,557 --> 00:48:01,616
- All of them?
- Every one.

534
00:48:04,929 --> 00:48:07,762
Oh, we were hanging those
along the stairs.

535
00:48:07,932 --> 00:48:12,232
Something just kept knocking them down,
so we stopped hanging them up.

536
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:17,937
That's what I was talking about.

537
00:48:18,275 --> 00:48:20,038
It was here when we moved in.

538
00:48:20,211 --> 00:48:22,372
There's also a lot of stuff in the cellar.

539
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:26,780
Show me the cellar.

540
00:48:38,896 --> 00:48:41,490
Look what she made me do.

541
00:48:41,765 --> 00:48:44,131
You picking up anything in here, hon?

542
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:50,601
Something awful happened here, Ed.

543
00:48:54,445 --> 00:48:57,642
Those bruises, they from something
that happened here?

544
00:48:57,815 --> 00:49:01,876
Oh, it's some iron deficiency thing I have.

545
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:07,414
You know, with all that's been going on,
why haven't you just moved out?

546
00:49:07,758 --> 00:49:09,692
I don't know where
we'd move to, you know?

547
00:49:09,893 --> 00:49:14,159
We got all our money tied up in this place
and had a lot of repairs on top of that.

548
00:49:14,832 --> 00:49:18,825
And I don't know anybody whose gonna
take in a family of seven indefinitely.

549
00:49:19,003 --> 00:49:20,903
That's why we tracked you down.

550
00:49:21,405 --> 00:49:23,134
We're glad you found us.

551
00:49:23,641 --> 00:49:25,939
All right, let's get started.

552
00:49:28,045 --> 00:49:31,503
My name is Ed Warren.
It's November 1st, 1971.

553
00:49:31,682 --> 00:49:33,673
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

554
00:49:33,851 --> 00:49:38,049
...who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.

555
00:49:38,989 --> 00:49:40,456
Okay, go ahead.

556
00:49:41,992 --> 00:49:43,357
Where do I start?

557
00:49:43,961 --> 00:49:45,622
From the first occurrence.

558
00:49:46,664 --> 00:49:48,689
I guess it was the clocks.

559
00:49:48,866 --> 00:49:50,834
Mom and Dad tell me
that you have a friend.

560
00:49:51,001 --> 00:49:53,196
His name's Rory.
He lives here too.

561
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:55,201
- Hmm.
- But he's always sad.

562
00:49:55,372 --> 00:49:56,396
Why is that?

563
00:49:56,573 --> 00:50:00,373
He won't tell me but I think
something bad happened to him.

564
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,344
Do you mind if I try to see Rory?

565
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,532
Hey.

566
00:51:48,285 --> 00:51:49,547
What is it?

567
00:52:10,707 --> 00:52:14,803
We bought it at auction from the bank, so,
you know, we never knew who lived here.

568
00:52:19,516 --> 00:52:24,681
Well, Lorraine and I both feel that
what your house needs is a cleansing.

569
00:52:25,989 --> 00:52:27,183
An exorcism.

570
00:52:28,792 --> 00:52:30,225
What, exorcism?

571
00:52:32,196 --> 00:52:35,165
I thought that was something
that you do to people.

572
00:52:35,332 --> 00:52:36,697
No, not necessarily, no.

573
00:52:37,334 --> 00:52:38,665
We have to get out of here.

574
00:52:38,836 --> 00:52:40,827
I'm afraid that's not gonna help.

575
00:52:42,873 --> 00:52:45,137
Lorraine saw something, which...

576
00:52:45,309 --> 00:52:46,606
Go ahead, hon.

577
00:52:49,012 --> 00:52:52,379
I've been seeing the dark entity
that haunts your house...

578
00:52:52,549 --> 00:52:54,039
...and your land.

579
00:52:58,622 --> 00:53:02,080
I saw it first when I came
through your door.

580
00:53:02,259 --> 00:53:04,489
It was latched to your back.

581
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:11,028
And then I saw it again with the girls
when we walked into the living room.

582
00:53:11,935 --> 00:53:14,233
And it doesn't matter where you go...

583
00:53:14,404 --> 00:53:17,532
...this dark entity has latched itself
to your family...

584
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:19,198
...and it's feeding off you.

585
00:53:22,279 --> 00:53:24,406
Even if we leave?

586
00:53:24,581 --> 00:53:27,243
Sometimes when you get haunted,
it's like stepping on gum.

587
00:53:27,851 --> 00:53:29,716
You take it with you.

588
00:53:30,654 --> 00:53:33,851
Look, I gotta tell you,
you have a lot of spirits in here...

589
00:53:34,024 --> 00:53:38,654
...but this is the one that I'm most
worried about, because it is so hateful.

590
00:53:39,396 --> 00:53:42,365
Okay, so what do we do?
Can we call a priest?

591
00:53:42,533 --> 00:53:43,795
I wish it were that easy.

592
00:53:43,967 --> 00:53:47,960
Performing an exorcism is an archaic
procedure. Requires years of training.

593
00:53:48,872 --> 00:53:52,899
And even then,
I have seen it go horribly wrong.

594
00:53:53,877 --> 00:53:57,574
But before we even get that far,
the church has to authorize it first.

595
00:53:57,748 --> 00:54:00,979
It means we gotta investigate,
gather evidence and provide proof...

596
00:54:01,184 --> 00:54:02,674
...and that's the hard part.

597
00:54:04,821 --> 00:54:06,550
Have your children been baptized?

598
00:54:06,723 --> 00:54:10,989
Uh, no, we never got around to that.
We're not really a churchgoing family.

599
00:54:11,261 --> 00:54:14,856
Well, you may want to rethink that.
Our presence here could make things worse.

600
00:54:15,032 --> 00:54:16,124
Why?

601
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,665
Because we're a threat.

602
00:54:17,834 --> 00:54:20,735
And whatever you're dealing with here
isn't gonna like us.

603
00:54:20,904 --> 00:54:24,465
So far it hasn't done anything violent,
and that's a good sign.

604
00:54:24,641 --> 00:54:27,542
So we're gonna have our guy
do some homework on the property...

605
00:54:27,711 --> 00:54:29,474
...to see what we're up against.

606
00:54:31,748 --> 00:54:33,511
Judy, what are you up to?

607
00:54:33,684 --> 00:54:36,448
- I got you a present.
- Aah.

608
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:39,714
Me and Nanna got these
at the church's yard sale.

609
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:41,721
- Honey.
- One for you and one for me.

610
00:54:41,892 --> 00:54:43,453
- Aw.
- She put a picture...

611
00:54:43,594 --> 00:54:44,856
...of you and Daddy in mine.

612
00:54:45,395 --> 00:54:48,523
Nanna said this way
we'll always be together.

613
00:54:48,699 --> 00:54:51,224
You'll be with me and I'll be with you.

614
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:55,997
I miss you and Daddy.

615
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:07,776
Hey, hon.

616
00:55:10,053 --> 00:55:11,077
Yup.

617
00:55:11,254 --> 00:55:14,087
You're not gonna believe this.
Carolyn's voice didn't record.

618
00:55:15,392 --> 00:55:16,450
What do you mean?

619
00:55:17,427 --> 00:55:18,621
Listen.

620
00:55:19,162 --> 00:55:22,563
My name is Ed Warren.
It's November 1st, 1971.

621
00:55:22,733 --> 00:55:24,564
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

622
00:55:24,735 --> 00:55:28,171
...who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.

623
00:55:28,538 --> 00:55:29,903
Okay, go ahead.

624
00:55:33,143 --> 00:55:34,940
From the first occurrence.

625
00:55:38,548 --> 00:55:39,810
Nothing.

626
00:55:40,417 --> 00:55:41,577
The whole time.

627
00:55:41,752 --> 00:55:44,312
- I don't know. You find anything?
- Lots.

628
00:55:44,955 --> 00:55:47,890
I mean, it's no wonder they're
going through what they are.

629
00:55:48,191 --> 00:55:50,091
That's the original farmhouse.

630
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:53,354
It was built in 1863 by a man
named Jedson Sherman...

631
00:55:53,563 --> 00:55:56,088
...who was married to a woman
named Bathsheba.

632
00:55:56,466 --> 00:55:59,526
Ed, she's related to Mary Towne Estye.

633
00:55:59,703 --> 00:56:01,904
She was one of the women
accused of witchcraft in Salem.

634
00:56:02,039 --> 00:56:03,973
- She was hung during the trials.
- Wow.

635
00:56:04,141 --> 00:56:07,008
After Bathsheba married Jedson,
they had a baby...

636
00:56:07,177 --> 00:56:09,008
...and when the baby was 7 days old...

637
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:12,046
...Jedson caught her sacrificing it
in front of the fireplace.

638
00:56:12,215 --> 00:56:14,308
She ran out to that tree by the dock...

639
00:56:14,484 --> 00:56:16,645
...climbed up, proclaimed her love
to Satan...

640
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:20,688
...cursed anyone who tried
to take her land, and hung herself.

641
00:56:22,526 --> 00:56:26,087
Time of death was pronounced at 3:07
in the morning.

642
00:56:26,496 --> 00:56:28,225
Well, that explains a few things.

643
00:56:28,398 --> 00:56:30,093
Yeah, so does this.

644
00:56:31,034 --> 00:56:33,434
Her last name's Walker.
She lived there in the '30s.

645
00:56:33,603 --> 00:56:36,663
She had a boy named Rory who
mysteriously disappeared in the woods.

646
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,603
Then she killed herself in the cellar.

647
00:56:39,676 --> 00:56:40,700
And that's not all.

648
00:56:43,213 --> 00:56:48,082
So, what was the original 200-acre farm
has since been subdivided and sold off.

649
00:56:48,251 --> 00:56:52,210
There was another boy who drowned in
a pond here. He lived in a house over here.

650
00:56:52,389 --> 00:56:56,519
And a woman who worked as a maid in a
neighboring home, she committed suicide too.

651
00:56:58,428 --> 00:57:00,259
People who took her land.

652
00:57:01,865 --> 00:57:04,146
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

653
00:57:04,301 --> 00:57:07,498
...who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.

654
00:57:09,005 --> 00:57:10,438
Okay, go ahead.

655
00:57:13,577 --> 00:57:15,670
From the first occurrence.

656
00:57:51,148 --> 00:57:52,376
Here's Brad.

657
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:57,786
- You find it okay?
- Oh, yeah.

658
00:57:57,954 --> 00:57:59,319
Drew, this is Officer Brad.

659
00:57:59,489 --> 00:58:02,014
Officer Brad Hamilton,
Harrisville, Rhode Island P.D.

660
00:58:02,192 --> 00:58:04,092
Hm. Nice to meet you, man.

661
00:58:04,394 --> 00:58:08,057
- So you're the lucky new cop, huh?
- Guess so.

662
00:58:08,231 --> 00:58:11,359
- You know you can't shoot ghosts, right?
- Take it easy on him, Drew.

663
00:58:11,535 --> 00:58:13,799
All right, guys,
help me get this stuff unloaded.

664
00:58:15,005 --> 00:58:16,438
You take this.

665
00:58:17,574 --> 00:58:18,768
Hi, Roger.

666
00:58:23,313 --> 00:58:28,250
All right. When you're finished here, why
don't you hit upstairs, all right, Drew?

667
00:58:28,418 --> 00:58:29,646
You got it.

668
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:54,036
What's wrong with the Chevy?

669
00:58:54,644 --> 00:58:56,635
Ugh, what's not wrong with her?

670
00:58:56,813 --> 00:58:58,974
- Needs a new carburetor to start.
- Oh, yeah?

671
00:58:59,149 --> 00:59:02,209
Kind of put fixing her up
on hold for a while.

672
00:59:02,385 --> 00:59:03,852
Yeah. Ahem.

673
00:59:05,789 --> 00:59:07,848
Hey, Brad, hand me a thermostat,
would you?

674
00:59:10,193 --> 00:59:12,525
What's this, uh, do?

675
00:59:13,063 --> 00:59:14,864
When there's an instant drop
in temperature...

676
00:59:14,998 --> 00:59:17,432
...the thermostat
triggers the camera to take a picture.

677
00:59:17,868 --> 00:59:19,893
You've actually caught things on film?

678
00:59:20,337 --> 00:59:22,862
Well, yeah, that's, uh, the point.

679
00:59:23,473 --> 00:59:26,567
Why, uh...? Why out here?

680
00:59:26,776 --> 00:59:29,472
Well, this is where the witch
committed suicide.

681
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:34,276
She hung herself from that branch
right above where you're standing.

682
00:59:40,857 --> 00:59:42,698
How could a mother kill her own child?

683
00:59:43,393 --> 00:59:45,258
It was never a child to her.

684
00:59:45,428 --> 00:59:49,057
She just used her God-given gift
as the ultimate offense against him.

685
00:59:49,232 --> 00:59:52,292
Witches believe it elevates their status
in the eyes of Satan.

686
01:00:01,077 --> 01:00:02,237
Mm.

687
01:00:02,412 --> 01:00:05,848
Wow.
That's a nice day at the beach, huh?

688
01:00:06,016 --> 01:00:07,813
How did you know?

689
01:00:08,051 --> 01:00:12,545
It's an insight. It's like a peek through
the curtain into another person's life.

690
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:16,357
Mm.

691
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,787
That day meant so much to me.
We were driving along the coast.

692
01:00:20,964 --> 01:00:23,558
Nancy pointed out
how pretty the view was.

693
01:00:24,134 --> 01:00:27,069
I thought this is a perfect opportunity
for a photo.

694
01:00:27,237 --> 01:00:30,365
We're gonna start fresh, you know?
A new house, a new beginning.

695
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:33,873
You should have seen Roger and the girls.
I've never seen them so happy.

696
01:00:34,044 --> 01:00:35,204
Cheese!

697
01:00:36,846 --> 01:00:38,973
They mean the world to me.

698
01:00:49,592 --> 01:00:51,389
Put your hand flat on the desk.

699
01:00:52,929 --> 01:00:54,794
Yeah, and take it off.

700
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:58,767
Here we go.

701
01:01:04,174 --> 01:01:05,198
See?

702
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:07,741
It just reveals to us what
the naked eye can't see.

703
01:01:07,911 --> 01:01:09,435
Pretty far out, isn't it?

704
01:01:10,313 --> 01:01:12,008
Yeah, it's groovy.

705
01:01:17,754 --> 01:01:19,881
Drew, you got the Bolex ready for Brad?

706
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:22,456
Yeah, already locked and loaded, sir.

707
01:01:40,043 --> 01:01:42,477
What? I had to go.

708
01:02:05,568 --> 01:02:08,128
All the rooms are coming in pretty good.

709
01:02:08,304 --> 01:02:09,532
Good.

710
01:02:15,011 --> 01:02:16,501
What's in the bottle?

711
01:02:17,313 --> 01:02:18,337
Holy water.

712
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:22,915
Presence of religious icons...

713
01:02:23,086 --> 01:02:26,078
...will get a reaction
from anything unholy.

714
01:02:27,824 --> 01:02:29,553
Sort of pisses them off.

715
01:02:30,894 --> 01:02:34,352
So I set these throughout the house,
see if I can stir things up a bit.

716
01:02:37,233 --> 01:02:40,999
- Like holding a cross to a vampire?
- Yeah. Exactly.

717
01:02:41,404 --> 01:02:43,565
Except I don't believe in vampires.

718
01:02:48,611 --> 01:02:49,839
Wasn't me.

719
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,884
Brad, get the camera.

720
01:03:09,699 --> 01:03:10,791
Okay.

721
01:03:17,073 --> 01:03:21,533
All right, it's 9:18, we're headed down into the
cellar where the door's just opened on its own.

722
01:03:21,711 --> 01:03:24,578
I have Lorraine and Officer Brad Hamilton
with me.

723
01:03:24,781 --> 01:03:26,874
Let's keep the cellar light off.

724
01:03:40,897 --> 01:03:43,764
Give us a sign that you wanna
communicate with us.

725
01:04:12,262 --> 01:04:13,752
Hon, you all right?

726
01:04:18,168 --> 01:04:20,568
There's definitely something here.

727
01:04:22,005 --> 01:04:25,133
- All right, close the door. Move something.
- My hands are so cold.

728
01:04:27,443 --> 01:04:28,671
Come on.

729
01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:34,976
No.

730
01:04:35,151 --> 01:04:36,812
It's gone. It's gone.

731
01:04:36,986 --> 01:04:38,453
I got nothing.

732
01:04:38,788 --> 01:04:40,085
Okay.

733
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:04,168
Well, like I said, it doesn't
always work when you want it to.

734
01:05:04,681 --> 01:05:07,115
Yeah, maybe the camera picked
something up.

735
01:05:07,917 --> 01:05:09,145
Watch out!

736
01:05:13,022 --> 01:05:14,502
For a guy who doesn't believe...

737
01:05:14,657 --> 01:05:18,024
...you looked a little freaked out
when that door slammed shut.

738
01:05:20,897 --> 01:05:22,922
It must have been a draft.

739
01:05:23,433 --> 01:05:25,128
Oh, that's funny.

740
01:05:25,668 --> 01:05:28,262
A draft never put that look
on my face before.

741
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:32,669
I believe the clock.

742
01:05:34,344 --> 01:05:35,936
It's 3:08.

743
01:05:46,155 --> 01:05:47,713
Let me see your glasses.

744
01:05:48,057 --> 01:05:49,081
For you.

745
01:05:49,259 --> 01:05:52,990
I think I might take some girls for ice cream later on.
What do you say about that?

746
01:05:53,162 --> 01:05:55,323
- Yeah!
- Honey, you wanna come?

747
01:05:55,498 --> 01:05:58,524
I'm exhausted. I'm just gonna take a nap.
The late nights are getting to me.

748
01:05:58,701 --> 01:06:01,101
That's probably a good idea.
Why don't you get some rest.

749
01:06:01,304 --> 01:06:03,864
- Lorraine and I'll watch over things for a bit.
- Really?

750
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,770
I'm gonna take off.
I have a shift starting in an hour.

751
01:06:06,943 --> 01:06:09,104
The house hasn't felt like this
in a long time.

752
01:06:09,312 --> 01:06:12,213
I think the kids feel a lot safer
with you around.

753
01:06:15,785 --> 01:06:18,253
- I could get used to this.
- What, me doing laundry?

754
01:06:20,356 --> 01:06:22,187
- Ha-ha-ha.
- You're funny.

755
01:06:22,825 --> 01:06:24,315
No, this place.

756
01:06:24,727 --> 01:06:26,820
Nice, fresh country air.

757
01:06:30,633 --> 01:06:33,158
They have such a beautiful family,
don't they?

758
01:06:33,336 --> 01:06:37,830
Yeah, that little one, April,
did you see her bring me pancakes?

759
01:06:43,246 --> 01:06:44,838
We've gotta help them.

760
01:06:45,348 --> 01:06:46,781
I know.

761
01:06:47,917 --> 01:06:50,442
- I'll start with the Chevy.
- Heh.

762
01:08:12,602 --> 01:08:13,864
Carolyn!

763
01:08:14,904 --> 01:08:15,928
Are you okay?

764
01:08:16,105 --> 01:08:17,265
Carolyn, open the door.

765
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,498
Carolyn, open up!

766
01:08:25,515 --> 01:08:26,539
Are you okay?

767
01:08:26,716 --> 01:08:27,978
- Oh, I'm fine.
- Are you sick?

768
01:08:28,151 --> 01:08:30,984
- I woke up feeling nauseous, that's all.
- I thought I saw...

769
01:08:31,154 --> 01:08:33,384
I hear Roger and the girls.

770
01:08:33,556 --> 01:08:34,614
One minute.

771
01:08:46,869 --> 01:08:48,962
- Guys, do you wanna play a game?
- Boring!

772
01:08:49,138 --> 01:08:50,264
Thank you, Daddy.

773
01:08:51,541 --> 01:08:52,735
Let's go inside.

774
01:08:57,013 --> 01:08:58,173
I thought that was you.

775
01:08:58,347 --> 01:08:59,575
Hey, I hope you don't mind.

776
01:08:59,749 --> 01:09:02,390
I got a good deal on a rebuild
at that wrecking yard in Smithfield.

777
01:09:02,552 --> 01:09:05,612
- No, you look like you know what you're doing.
- Yeah, we'll see.

778
01:09:08,558 --> 01:09:10,253
Got a nice place here, Roger.

779
01:09:10,426 --> 01:09:12,758
Lorraine and I always wanted
a spot in the country.

780
01:09:12,929 --> 01:09:14,226
I'll sell you this one.

781
01:09:16,432 --> 01:09:17,956
Hey, hand me a wrench, would you?

782
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:25,007
Hey, uh, it really means a lot
to us to have you here.

783
01:09:25,174 --> 01:09:28,268
I gotta admit, I was a little
bit skeptical going in.

784
01:09:29,479 --> 01:09:32,642
Just wanna say thank you, though,
for coming out when you did.

785
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:38,011
I can't take the credit.
That's, uh... That's all Lorraine.

786
01:09:38,187 --> 01:09:40,917
- I didn't want to.
- Oh. Why's that?

787
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:47,661
Whatever Lorraine sees, feels, touches,
it helps people.

788
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:49,957
But it also takes a toll on her.

789
01:09:50,199 --> 01:09:51,530
Little piece each time.

790
01:09:55,505 --> 01:09:58,201
Couple months ago
we were working on a case.

791
01:09:59,809 --> 01:10:01,504
She saw something.

792
01:10:12,021 --> 01:10:13,545
It took a real big piece.

793
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:16,982
When we got home...

794
01:10:17,193 --> 01:10:20,185
...she went into our room,
locked herself in...

795
01:10:20,363 --> 01:10:23,196
...didn't talk, didn't eat,
didn't come out for eight days.

796
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:25,463
What'd she see?

797
01:10:28,437 --> 01:10:29,631
Get out of here!

798
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:32,002
I don't know.

799
01:10:32,508 --> 01:10:34,169
And I won't ask.

800
01:10:52,028 --> 01:10:55,156
I need to reload. You want some?

801
01:10:55,665 --> 01:10:57,155
I'm good, thanks.

802
01:10:58,034 --> 01:10:59,296
All right.

803
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:45,880
Look what she made me do.

804
01:12:29,525 --> 01:12:31,823
Look what she made me do.

805
01:12:34,697 --> 01:12:35,891
Hey.

806
01:12:43,339 --> 01:12:44,363
Ed?

807
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:45,768
Look what she made me do!

808
01:12:47,977 --> 01:12:49,569
Ed! Ed!

809
01:12:50,212 --> 01:12:51,440
Ed!

810
01:12:52,581 --> 01:12:53,775
Dude, you okay?

811
01:12:53,949 --> 01:12:55,416
Hold up, Brad. What's going on?

812
01:12:55,584 --> 01:12:58,485
I saw someone. There was
a woman dressed as a maid.

813
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:04,126
Ed? Ed, we're getting something.

814
01:13:09,398 --> 01:13:12,265
- It's just Cindy. She's sleepwalking.
- No, wait. We need this.

815
01:13:12,435 --> 01:13:13,996
Why do we need pictures of Cindy?

816
01:13:14,904 --> 01:13:16,462
She didn't trigger it.

817
01:13:16,639 --> 01:13:19,938
- What do you mean she didn't trigger it?
- Somebody's with her.

818
01:13:23,112 --> 01:13:24,272
Who?

819
01:13:28,184 --> 01:13:29,515
Cindy!

820
01:13:33,255 --> 01:13:34,517
Cindy!

821
01:13:41,297 --> 01:13:42,696
Cindy!

822
01:13:42,865 --> 01:13:44,492
Hey, over here. It's safe.

823
01:13:44,667 --> 01:13:46,532
There's someone else in there with her.

824
01:13:47,837 --> 01:13:50,135
I'm hearing another voice. Here, listen.

825
01:13:54,910 --> 01:13:57,140
Follow me. This way.

826
01:13:58,614 --> 01:14:00,411
This is where I hide.

827
01:14:05,554 --> 01:14:06,816
Cindy?

828
01:14:09,358 --> 01:14:10,655
Cindy?

829
01:14:12,461 --> 01:14:13,621
Where'd she go, Ed?

830
01:14:14,063 --> 01:14:15,621
Windows are locked.

831
01:14:18,701 --> 01:14:20,635
Ed, where'd she go?

832
01:14:22,171 --> 01:14:23,536
Brad, get the UV light.

833
01:14:23,706 --> 01:14:25,867
- The what?
- Just ask Drew.

834
01:14:26,976 --> 01:14:29,774
- Drew, I need a UV light.
- Uh...

835
01:14:29,945 --> 01:14:31,435
Here, that's it. Go, go, go, go!

836
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:39,544
Turn off the light.

837
01:14:43,192 --> 01:14:44,716
Get out of the way.

838
01:14:47,897 --> 01:14:49,023
Okay.

839
01:15:18,294 --> 01:15:19,784
Hit the lights!

840
01:15:31,907 --> 01:15:33,374
Found her.

841
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:36,034
Here we go.

842
01:15:36,645 --> 01:15:38,875
- All right. You got her?
- Yeah.

843
01:15:50,626 --> 01:15:53,652
That's where Rory hides
when he's afraid.

844
01:16:19,421 --> 01:16:22,356
Hon? Could I have April's
music box, please?

845
01:16:25,461 --> 01:16:28,157
- How's Cindy?
- She doesn't remember a thing.

846
01:16:31,133 --> 01:16:32,430
Here you go.

847
01:16:33,202 --> 01:16:34,499
Thank you.

848
01:17:12,107 --> 01:17:13,506
Lorraine!

849
01:17:17,579 --> 01:17:18,841
No.

850
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:32,922
Lorraine!

851
01:17:33,162 --> 01:17:34,424
Lorraine!

852
01:17:38,767 --> 01:17:40,166
Lorraine!

853
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:42,369
Lorraine!

854
01:18:33,522 --> 01:18:36,252
She made me do it.

855
01:18:37,326 --> 01:18:39,886
She made me do it.

856
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:04,212
She made me do it.

857
01:19:47,963 --> 01:19:48,987
Ed!

858
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:50,995
Come on! Lorraine!

859
01:19:58,841 --> 01:19:59,933
Ed!

860
01:20:00,809 --> 01:20:02,504
Ed, I know what she did.

861
01:20:02,711 --> 01:20:05,236
- I got you. I know. It's okay.
- I know what she did.

862
01:20:05,414 --> 01:20:08,349
I know what she did. She possessed
the mother to kill the child.

863
01:20:08,517 --> 01:20:09,984
She visits Carolyn every night.

864
01:20:10,152 --> 01:20:12,985
That's what the bruise marks are!
She's feeding off of her!

865
01:20:26,135 --> 01:20:27,693
Uh...

866
01:20:27,936 --> 01:20:29,335
Nancy?

867
01:20:33,842 --> 01:20:35,104
Nancy!

868
01:20:35,477 --> 01:20:36,774
Are you okay?

869
01:20:37,379 --> 01:20:38,676
Nancy!

870
01:20:40,182 --> 01:20:41,240
Grab her!

871
01:20:43,785 --> 01:20:45,309
Daddy! Help!

872
01:20:46,221 --> 01:20:47,279
Nancy!

873
01:20:54,563 --> 01:20:55,621
Is she okay?

874
01:20:55,797 --> 01:20:56,991
It's okay, I got you.

875
01:20:57,166 --> 01:20:58,190
Did you get that?

876
01:21:00,502 --> 01:21:01,662
Yeah.

877
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:07,832
I'll have the footage developed
and get it over to Father Gordon.

878
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:12,003
He's our liaison at the church.
I imagine we'll get a pretty fast response.

879
01:21:12,181 --> 01:21:14,240
- Listen, Roger?
- Yeah?

880
01:21:14,416 --> 01:21:17,579
Listen, when we get the exorcist,
I'll be back. But Lorraine...

881
01:21:17,753 --> 01:21:20,813
- Yeah, I understand.
- Until then Drew's gonna keep an eye on you.

882
01:21:20,989 --> 01:21:23,321
- Hey, Ed, thank you for everything.
- Yeah.

883
01:21:24,793 --> 01:21:26,021
Mommy?

884
01:21:28,363 --> 01:21:29,990
That's everything.

885
01:21:41,944 --> 01:21:43,309
Mommy?

886
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:02,722
Judy?

887
01:22:03,065 --> 01:22:04,396
Oh, God!

888
01:22:04,566 --> 01:22:05,692
Judy?

889
01:22:14,376 --> 01:22:16,276
Lorraine! Wait!

890
01:22:17,879 --> 01:22:19,403
Lorraine. What?

891
01:22:19,581 --> 01:22:20,912
Mom, it's me. Is Judy okay?

892
01:22:21,083 --> 01:22:23,574
- What?
- Can you go check, please?

893
01:22:24,119 --> 01:22:25,814
Damn it, Mom, just check, please!

894
01:22:25,988 --> 01:22:28,786
- Are you gonna tell me what's going on?
- It's Judy.

895
01:22:28,957 --> 01:22:30,481
What? What do you mean?

896
01:22:31,493 --> 01:22:32,585
What?

897
01:22:33,996 --> 01:22:36,157
Oh, thank God.

898
01:22:36,765 --> 01:22:39,962
Mom, I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you. I'll explain later, okay?

899
01:22:41,603 --> 01:22:42,934
What the hell happened?

900
01:22:43,105 --> 01:22:46,563
I had a vision of Judy in the water.

901
01:22:46,742 --> 01:22:49,006
I know it was some kind of warning.

902
01:22:50,245 --> 01:22:51,735
I know it.

903
01:22:51,913 --> 01:22:53,107
Okay.

904
01:22:55,150 --> 01:22:56,515
Let's get out of here.

905
01:23:44,499 --> 01:23:46,967
- So?
- Yeah, well, you weren't kidding.

906
01:23:47,135 --> 01:23:48,193
No.

907
01:23:49,004 --> 01:23:53,168
Look, Ed, this is complicated
because the kids aren't baptized.

908
01:23:53,342 --> 01:23:56,539
- No, I understand.
- And the family are not members of the church.

909
01:23:56,712 --> 01:23:58,043
- Oh, come on.
- And...

910
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:02,338
The approval would have to come
directly from the Vatican.

911
01:24:03,752 --> 01:24:06,653
Father, we've never seen nothing like this.

912
01:24:10,525 --> 01:24:13,255
Yeah, well, neither have I.

913
01:24:21,970 --> 01:24:23,835
Father, they don't have a lot of time.

914
01:24:24,473 --> 01:24:25,667
All right.

915
01:24:27,175 --> 01:24:28,733
I'll push it through myself.

916
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:30,878
- Thank you, Father. Thank you.
- Thank you.

917
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:34,381
- All right, we'll wait for your call.
- Yeah.

918
01:25:38,146 --> 01:25:40,341
Mommy? Daddy?

919
01:25:57,766 --> 01:25:59,165
Mommy?

920
01:25:59,668 --> 01:26:00,999
Daddy?

921
01:26:24,726 --> 01:26:26,193
Dad?

922
01:26:42,511 --> 01:26:43,978
Nanna?

923
01:26:45,247 --> 01:26:46,612
Nanna?

924
01:26:59,628 --> 01:27:00,925
Aah!

925
01:27:40,969 --> 01:27:42,459
Nanna!

926
01:27:42,671 --> 01:27:45,469
Nanna, help! Nanna, help!

927
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:46,664
Judy?

928
01:27:46,841 --> 01:27:48,035
Nanna!

929
01:27:48,209 --> 01:27:49,608
Nanna!

930
01:27:49,778 --> 01:27:51,177
Nanna!

931
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:52,908
Help!

932
01:27:53,381 --> 01:27:54,973
- Judy!
- Nanna!

933
01:27:55,183 --> 01:27:56,980
- Judy, open the door!
- Mom!

934
01:27:58,954 --> 01:28:00,979
- Ed, there's something wrong.
- What?

935
01:28:04,192 --> 01:28:05,250
Nanna!

936
01:28:05,827 --> 01:28:07,454
- Judy!
- Help!

937
01:28:07,629 --> 01:28:09,824
- Judy! Judy, open this door!
- What is it?

938
01:28:09,998 --> 01:28:13,092
- What's wrong with her? Judy!
- Hey, move. Move, move, move, move.

939
01:28:13,268 --> 01:28:14,895
Judy, get back, honey. Get back!

940
01:28:15,403 --> 01:28:16,768
- Come on!
- Hurry.

941
01:28:17,505 --> 01:28:19,405
Help! Help!

942
01:28:20,108 --> 01:28:21,700
Get away from the door, Judy!

943
01:28:24,713 --> 01:28:26,578
Aah!

944
01:28:26,748 --> 01:28:28,409
Oh, God! Are you okay?

945
01:28:28,583 --> 01:28:32,644
There was someone rocking
in the chair with Annabelle.

946
01:28:35,724 --> 01:28:36,850
What?

947
01:28:40,095 --> 01:28:41,357
It's okay.

948
01:29:01,249 --> 01:29:02,682
She's still in the case.

949
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:06,544
It's okay.

950
01:29:07,822 --> 01:29:09,380
It's okay. It's okay.

951
01:29:14,863 --> 01:29:17,297
- Dad! Dad!
- Daddy!

952
01:29:17,465 --> 01:29:19,797
Dad! Dad! Mom just left
with Christine and April.

953
01:29:19,968 --> 01:29:22,448
She went in the car and drove away.
I don't know what happened.

954
01:29:22,604 --> 01:29:25,245
- She smells like rotting meat.
- She didn't say what was going on.

955
01:29:25,306 --> 01:29:28,901
- What do you mean, she left? Left where?
- Gone! I don't know where she was going.

956
01:29:34,282 --> 01:29:35,977
Where are we going, Mom?

957
01:29:44,559 --> 01:29:45,856
- Hello?
- It's Roger.

958
01:29:46,027 --> 01:29:47,388
Something's going on with Carolyn.

959
01:29:47,562 --> 01:29:50,395
Andrea was here, said Carolyn took
off with Christine and April.

960
01:29:50,565 --> 01:29:53,295
- The girls said she smelled like rotten meat.
- She possesses the mother...

961
01:29:53,468 --> 01:29:56,028
...to kill the child, that's what she does.
She's taking them to the house.

962
01:29:56,204 --> 01:29:58,263
Roger, get back to the house now.
I'll meet you.

963
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:01,841
Lock the door, close the blinds.
Stay off the phone!

964
01:30:03,011 --> 01:30:04,205
Go.

965
01:30:09,551 --> 01:30:11,392
- I'm coming.
- No, you stay with Judy.

966
01:30:11,519 --> 01:30:14,079
The only way to protect Judy
is if we stop this where it started.

967
01:30:14,122 --> 01:30:17,216
- Otherwise, she'll latch onto us again.
- That's exactly why I am going.

968
01:30:17,392 --> 01:30:20,020
You think I'm gonna let you walk
into this alone?

969
01:30:20,695 --> 01:30:22,026
I can't lose you.

970
01:30:22,597 --> 01:30:23,859
You won't.

971
01:30:24,933 --> 01:30:26,696
Let's finish this together.

972
01:30:45,553 --> 01:30:48,215
- Agh! It's locked.
- Carolyn!

973
01:30:48,757 --> 01:30:49,781
Roger!

974
01:30:49,958 --> 01:30:51,084
Get out of the way!

975
01:30:57,298 --> 01:30:58,959
- Roger!
- Ed!

976
01:30:59,134 --> 01:31:00,726
- Carolyn!
- Ed!

977
01:31:01,903 --> 01:31:03,224
- Carolyn!
- We're down here!

978
01:31:03,338 --> 01:31:06,136
Carolyn, don't!
No, no! She's got...!

979
01:31:06,307 --> 01:31:08,434
Get her hand! Get the scissors!

980
01:31:19,754 --> 01:31:22,074
- We gotta get her to the car!
- And bring her where?

981
01:31:22,257 --> 01:31:24,225
To take her to the priest
for the exorcism.

982
01:31:24,425 --> 01:31:25,746
- Where's April?
- April?

983
01:31:28,129 --> 01:31:29,426
April!

984
01:31:30,098 --> 01:31:32,293
Take Christine to the car and find April!

985
01:31:32,467 --> 01:31:33,491
April!

986
01:31:34,669 --> 01:31:35,966
Come on!

987
01:31:46,281 --> 01:31:48,482
- She won't let her leave the house.
- What do you mean?

988
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:50,950
- If we take her out, the witch will kill her.
- Agh!

989
01:31:57,559 --> 01:32:00,289
Roger!

990
01:32:00,461 --> 01:32:01,792
Carolyn!

991
01:32:02,163 --> 01:32:03,187
Go!

992
01:32:03,364 --> 01:32:04,456
Carolyn?

993
01:32:09,804 --> 01:32:12,068
Okay, I'm gonna put you in here.
Come on.

994
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:14,834
- Get in. Stay in here.
- I don't wanna stay here by myself.

995
01:32:15,009 --> 01:32:16,806
Stay in here no matter what.
I'll be back.

996
01:32:16,978 --> 01:32:19,378
I have to find April, okay?
I'll be back, I promise.

997
01:32:22,350 --> 01:32:23,510
April?

998
01:32:26,487 --> 01:32:27,715
You okay?

999
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:33,888
Stop!

1000
01:32:37,365 --> 01:32:39,458
Brad! Brad!

1001
01:32:43,338 --> 01:32:44,862
Aah!

1002
01:32:53,248 --> 01:32:55,113
Let's get something to tie her up!

1003
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:04,055
Hold it.

1004
01:33:14,869 --> 01:33:17,531
I gotta call Father Gordon.
We gotta get him out here.

1005
01:33:17,705 --> 01:33:20,037
He's too far away.
She won't make it. Look at her.

1006
01:33:30,685 --> 01:33:33,119
- Then you need to leave.
- What are you talking about?

1007
01:33:33,454 --> 01:33:35,422
I have to do it. The exorcism.

1008
01:33:35,890 --> 01:33:38,825
What? I thought you said we
need a priest. You're not a priest.

1009
01:33:39,027 --> 01:33:41,427
- Well, you got a better idea?
- He can do it.

1010
01:33:42,530 --> 01:33:44,725
- You can do it.
- But you gotta get out of here.

1011
01:33:44,899 --> 01:33:48,494
- I'm not leaving you!
- Damn it, I'm not doing this with you in here!

1012
01:33:50,305 --> 01:33:53,570
God brought us together for a reason.
This is it.

1013
01:33:54,542 --> 01:33:56,169
I'm gonna get the book.

1014
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:14,125
April!

1015
01:34:23,004 --> 01:34:24,335
April!

1016
01:34:45,994 --> 01:34:49,725
"In the name of the Father,
the Son, the Holy Spirit."

1017
01:35:29,437 --> 01:35:30,563
April!

1018
01:36:30,498 --> 01:36:32,557
Hold her still! Hold her still!

1019
01:36:32,733 --> 01:36:34,496
Come here! Hold her still!

1020
01:36:43,311 --> 01:36:44,573
April?

1021
01:36:51,452 --> 01:36:52,476
April!

1022
01:36:52,653 --> 01:36:54,211
April, you under there?

1023
01:36:55,623 --> 01:36:56,647
April!

1024
01:37:02,330 --> 01:37:05,322
Carolyn. Carolyn. Don't give in!
Don't let her take you!

1025
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:07,559
Ed! You gotta stop,
you're killing her. Stop!

1026
01:37:07,735 --> 01:37:09,100
No, he can't!

1027
01:37:10,071 --> 01:37:13,939
Roger, help me!

1028
01:37:18,846 --> 01:37:20,837
Ed! Goddamn it, stop it!

1029
01:37:21,015 --> 01:37:23,449
Understand this! We are
now fighting for her soul!

1030
01:37:23,618 --> 01:37:26,849
"In the name of Jesus Christ,
the saints and all the angels...

1031
01:37:27,054 --> 01:37:29,113
...I command you to reveal yourself!"

1032
01:37:58,519 --> 01:38:01,113
Roger, help me!

1033
01:38:52,340 --> 01:38:53,739
Put her down!

1034
01:38:54,709 --> 01:38:55,869
Put her down!

1035
01:38:58,079 --> 01:38:59,171
Put her down!

1036
01:39:01,048 --> 01:39:02,242
Carolyn!

1037
01:39:02,516 --> 01:39:03,744
Carolyn!

1038
01:39:06,454 --> 01:39:08,581
- Ed, look out!
- Unh!

1039
01:39:12,059 --> 01:39:13,549
Are you okay?

1040
01:39:15,563 --> 01:39:17,531
Hold her still! Don't let her up!

1041
01:39:17,698 --> 01:39:19,097
We're losing her, Roger!

1042
01:39:19,267 --> 01:39:21,792
Damn you! You leave my family alone,
you hear me?

1043
01:39:21,969 --> 01:39:24,610
I don't know what you are, but you leave
my wife alone, goddamn it!

1044
01:39:24,772 --> 01:39:27,764
Let her go!
Do you hear me? Let her go!

1045
01:39:30,144 --> 01:39:32,578
Let her go, goddamn it! Let her go!

1046
01:39:38,919 --> 01:39:41,080
She's already gone.

1047
01:39:41,789 --> 01:39:43,916
And now you're all gonna die.

1048
01:39:51,432 --> 01:39:52,456
April!

1049
01:39:52,633 --> 01:39:56,501
I found her! She's under the house!
Under the kitchen!

1050
01:39:58,072 --> 01:39:59,130
Don't! No!

1051
01:39:59,974 --> 01:40:01,271
Get her!

1052
01:40:15,723 --> 01:40:17,122
- Here.
- Carolyn!

1053
01:40:19,894 --> 01:40:22,014
- Carolyn!
- She's in that hole. Right there.

1054
01:40:24,632 --> 01:40:26,691
Carolyn? Oh, my God. No!

1055
01:40:26,867 --> 01:40:29,597
Can't go in. Can't reach.

1056
01:40:30,037 --> 01:40:31,299
No! Carolyn, don't!

1057
01:40:33,674 --> 01:40:35,005
Carolyn, no!

1058
01:40:35,309 --> 01:40:37,174
Bathsheba!

1059
01:40:39,513 --> 01:40:43,540
By the power of God,
I condemn you back to hell!

1060
01:40:46,087 --> 01:40:47,520
This is your daughter!

1061
01:40:49,690 --> 01:40:52,352
- You can't give in!
- Agh!

1062
01:40:52,526 --> 01:40:54,790
Roger. We need to get her
to fight from the inside.

1063
01:40:54,962 --> 01:40:57,487
Don't let her do this.
Don't let this thing do this.

1064
01:40:57,665 --> 01:40:59,860
You gotta fight it.
You're stronger than she is.

1065
01:41:00,034 --> 01:41:01,899
- You gotta fight!
- Keep it going, Roger!

1066
01:41:02,069 --> 01:41:04,833
You gotta stay with us, all right?
Come on back, Carolyn.

1067
01:41:05,406 --> 01:41:06,873
You're in, that's it! Get her back!

1068
01:41:07,041 --> 01:41:09,669
- Remember what you showed me.
- No!

1069
01:41:11,579 --> 01:41:14,104
Remember that day that you said
you would never forget.

1070
01:41:23,824 --> 01:41:26,190
You said they meant the world to you.

1071
01:41:26,727 --> 01:41:28,922
This is what you'll be leaving behind.

1072
01:42:07,835 --> 01:42:09,097
Mommy?

1073
01:42:36,730 --> 01:42:38,095
Oh.

1074
01:42:42,369 --> 01:42:43,802
It's over.

1075
01:42:44,305 --> 01:42:45,897
I am so sorry.

1076
01:42:46,073 --> 01:42:50,066
I love you so much. I love you so much.

1077
01:42:50,244 --> 01:42:51,575
I love you so much.

1078
01:42:52,947 --> 01:42:54,505
I'm so happy.

1079
01:43:16,504 --> 01:43:18,199
A draft do that to your face?

1080
01:43:19,006 --> 01:43:21,099
I'd take a guy with a gun any day.

1081
01:43:25,312 --> 01:43:26,802
You did good.

1082
01:43:27,281 --> 01:43:28,646
No, you did.

1083
01:44:29,276 --> 01:44:32,404
I'll call Father Gordon
and let him know what happened.

1084
01:44:33,347 --> 01:44:34,871
Sounds good.

1085
01:45:00,107 --> 01:45:02,735
The Vatican approved the exorcism.

1086
01:45:03,043 --> 01:45:05,034
Heh. Nice timing.

1087
01:45:06,647 --> 01:45:10,310
And if we can, then he'd like
to meet with us tomorrow.

1088
01:45:10,517 --> 01:45:12,985
There's a case in Long Island
he'd like to discuss.

1089
01:45:13,153 --> 01:45:14,245
Really?

1090
01:52:32,098 --> 01:52:33,531
Nanna!

1091
01:52:34,967 --> 01:52:37,595
You know, being scared
is like being made to laugh.

1092
01:52:37,804 --> 01:52:39,396
It's an instinctive reaction.

1093
01:52:39,605 --> 01:52:42,938
When something scary is happening,
you just feel it automatically.

1094
01:52:47,847 --> 01:52:49,144
A mark.

1095
01:52:49,348 --> 01:52:52,146
Getting James on board this project
was a home run for us.

1096
01:52:52,351 --> 01:52:55,787
When the screenplay was ready
to go out to directors...

1097
01:52:55,955 --> 01:52:58,014
...and we were putting together our list...

1098
01:52:58,224 --> 01:53:00,556
...there was one name
that was the top of everybody's list.

1099
01:53:00,793 --> 01:53:03,728
New Line's, Warner Bros., mine.
And that was James'.

1100
01:53:03,963 --> 01:53:07,194
He was the only director
that we ever went to on this movie.

1101
01:53:07,467 --> 01:53:11,028
I wanted to do something
I haven't done before...

1102
01:53:11,237 --> 01:53:14,832
...and that is basically
deal into the world of, you know...

1103
01:53:15,308 --> 01:53:17,003
...telling a biographic story.

1104
01:53:17,210 --> 01:53:18,802
So, what are you guys?

1105
01:53:19,011 --> 01:53:20,672
Ghost hunters, paranormal researchers.

1106
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:22,177
- Kooks.
Ha-ha-ha.

1107
01:53:22,381 --> 01:53:26,078
But we prefer to be known simply
as Ed and Lorraine Warren.

1108
01:53:26,319 --> 01:53:31,052
The crucial aspect for me
was the real-life inspiration...

1109
01:53:31,257 --> 01:53:32,588
...of Ed and Lorraine Warren.

1110
01:53:32,825 --> 01:53:35,586
I could pull from a lot of the stories
they've had in the past...

1111
01:53:35,762 --> 01:53:39,391
...I think they investigated
over 10,000 cases in their lifetime.

1112
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:43,160
And so that means, you know,
a lot of great materials to pull from.

1113
01:53:43,369 --> 01:53:46,532
James is able to...

1114
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:49,208
...elevate the level of the genre...

1115
01:53:49,776 --> 01:53:54,975
...to a point where you don't
necessarily need the blood...

1116
01:53:55,181 --> 01:53:58,378
...you don't need the guts to scare people.

1117
01:54:07,059 --> 01:54:09,926
That's actually drawing him to the room
and talking to her.

1118
01:54:10,096 --> 01:54:12,792
His artistry is off the charts.

1119
01:54:13,432 --> 01:54:18,597
You know, his visual sense,
his production design sense...

1120
01:54:20,373 --> 01:54:24,400
...his eye for the camera,
he gets the rhythm.

1121
01:54:24,577 --> 01:54:28,604
It's less about cheap scares,
it's about where do you put the camera...

1122
01:54:28,815 --> 01:54:32,717
...how do you frame it, how do you use
empty spaces to build suspense with?

1123
01:54:32,919 --> 01:54:36,650
I want it to feel very real.
I always, when I create these scenes...

1124
01:54:36,889 --> 01:54:40,381
...I want to put you, the audience,
in there with the family...

1125
01:54:40,593 --> 01:54:45,656
...so one of the tricks I do a lot of is
if a character's walking down a hallway...

1126
01:54:45,898 --> 01:54:49,766
...I would always have the camera be behind
the character following down the hallway.

1127
01:54:49,969 --> 01:54:52,096
So you're there with them.
You're walking with them.

1128
01:54:52,305 --> 01:54:54,239
And so you don't know
what's in front of them.

1129
01:54:54,440 --> 01:54:56,840
Yeah, maybe the camera picked
something up.

1130
01:54:57,643 --> 01:54:59,076
Watch out!

1131
01:54:59,812 --> 01:55:01,245
Cool.

1132
01:55:01,447 --> 01:55:04,177
And you can see it in the actors
that they respond to that.

1133
01:55:04,350 --> 01:55:06,978
That they understand
what he's trying to get.

1134
01:55:07,186 --> 01:55:10,747
Not only just performance-wise, but also
by moving the camera in certain ways...

1135
01:55:10,957 --> 01:55:13,255
...to build up the suspense
and build up the scares.

1136
01:55:13,426 --> 01:55:16,953
Sometimes in these kind of movies
you write too many scares.

1137
01:55:17,163 --> 01:55:19,131
Because you think
it's gotta be scare after scare.

1138
01:55:19,332 --> 01:55:22,130
You can't do that,
you gottajust build, slow it down.

1139
01:55:22,335 --> 01:55:25,998
Actually, that's one thing that James said,
his first read, he goes:

1140
01:55:26,205 --> 01:55:29,565
- "I love all these scares, there's too many."
- "We gotta pull some of these out."

1141
01:55:29,642 --> 01:55:32,440
We're like, "This is a horror
movie, James." And he goes:

1142
01:55:32,645 --> 01:55:35,205
"We have to build the tension.
We're gonna build more tension...

1143
01:55:35,314 --> 01:55:37,282
...between the scares."
He goes, "Trust me."

1144
01:55:37,450 --> 01:55:38,508
Yeah, he was spot-on.

1145
01:55:38,684 --> 01:55:43,178
My approach for the scares
and the suspense sequences in this film...

1146
01:55:43,389 --> 01:55:47,291
...are definitely much... Are based much...
Are much more grounded.

1147
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:51,487
I tried to put into the film, you know,
things that happened to the family.

1148
01:55:51,697 --> 01:55:54,894
You know, things that they would see,
that they would experience in this house.

1149
01:55:55,134 --> 01:55:57,500
You know, a rocking chair on its own.

1150
01:55:58,137 --> 01:55:59,798
Like a creaking door.

1151
01:56:02,108 --> 01:56:04,872
Those are classic haunted house
horror movie tropes.

1152
01:56:05,111 --> 01:56:09,377
But there's a reason why they're there because
when they work, they're so effective.

1153
01:56:10,349 --> 01:56:12,112
Nanna?

1154
01:56:14,387 --> 01:56:16,855
I've always said
what makes scary movies work...

1155
01:56:17,056 --> 01:56:19,616
...is not so much the visual...

1156
01:56:19,825 --> 01:56:23,056
...it's the sound,
it's what you think you see...

1157
01:56:23,262 --> 01:56:26,993
...through the sound design
that is the most important thing.

1158
01:56:27,199 --> 01:56:30,599
Keep coming around, come around, and then he
starts to back away here, and the thud...

1159
01:56:30,770 --> 01:56:31,828
...as we go along.

1160
01:56:42,949 --> 01:56:44,644
There's a difference in wanting
to scare an audience...

1161
01:56:44,850 --> 01:56:46,290
...and wanting to trick an audience.

1162
01:56:46,452 --> 01:56:49,387
James is one of those people that
would never want to trick an audience.

1163
01:56:49,555 --> 01:56:53,514
It's not about fooling them into thinking
this is something different.

1164
01:56:53,693 --> 01:56:56,890
He loves to scare you,
but he's just not gonna trick you.

1165
01:57:02,168 --> 01:57:06,434
And to me, why I think...

1166
01:57:06,672 --> 01:57:10,574
...the haunted house subgenre
or the haunting genre is so enduring...

1167
01:57:10,776 --> 01:57:14,542
...is it takes place in a world
that we all understand...

1168
01:57:14,747 --> 01:57:16,476
...which is it takes place in the home.

1169
01:57:16,716 --> 01:57:19,207
What has been fantastic
for me on this film...

1170
01:57:19,418 --> 01:57:25,050
...for me to realize my vision, we literally
built this two-story house inside a stage.

1171
01:57:25,257 --> 01:57:28,886
And that was amazing, you know, just, like,
seeing how quickly it came together.

1172
01:57:29,095 --> 01:57:31,928
And how, you know, we would talk about...

1173
01:57:32,131 --> 01:57:34,326
And how Julie would find ways
to accommodate what I...

1174
01:57:34,567 --> 01:57:36,125
How I wanna shoot my sequences.

1175
01:57:36,335 --> 01:57:39,270
The driving force is
I need to achieve what the script had.

1176
01:57:39,438 --> 01:57:42,430
And what James wants, his vision.

1177
01:57:42,641 --> 01:57:45,961
We realized very much what we've been
saying about how James frames a shot...

1178
01:57:46,012 --> 01:57:47,809
...and what he needs out of each scene...

1179
01:57:48,014 --> 01:57:51,006
...is that doorways had to be in an
exact spot to make the scare work.

1180
01:57:51,250 --> 01:57:53,931
And hallways needed to be a certain length
and a certain darkness...

1181
01:57:54,120 --> 01:57:57,112
...to be able to kind of have things
come out of them and make them scary.

1182
01:58:00,659 --> 01:58:03,093
The details were so fantastic, you know?

1183
01:58:03,462 --> 01:58:08,263
Um, so I just love when a production
designer is on that level, I just...

1184
01:58:08,467 --> 01:58:12,801
I just love when they've just filled in
every little... They filled the canvas in.

1185
01:58:13,005 --> 01:58:17,169
For me, I take all these stories
and I try to filter it through myself.

1186
01:58:17,376 --> 01:58:20,834
I try to think of it through my own head,
going, "Okay, what scares me?"

1187
01:58:21,047 --> 01:58:23,948
Roger!

1188
01:58:24,750 --> 01:58:28,447
When I first read the script, the more I started
designing that end sequence, I realized:

1189
01:58:28,654 --> 01:58:32,613
"Wow, that could be a really cool,
iconic moment for the film."

1190
01:58:32,825 --> 01:58:35,851
I kind of didn't wanna show
her face when she was transforming...

1191
01:58:36,062 --> 01:58:37,893
...into, like, this scary person.

1192
01:58:38,130 --> 01:58:41,122
And so the way to do that was...

1193
01:58:41,333 --> 01:58:44,461
...we had Lily's character...

1194
01:58:44,904 --> 01:58:47,998
...attacking someone,
attacking Brad, the cop character...

1195
01:58:48,207 --> 01:58:50,471
...and biting him in the face.

1196
01:58:52,378 --> 01:58:55,040
And in doing so,
that allowed me to muzzle her...

1197
01:58:55,281 --> 01:58:58,546
...with a sheet across her and basically
spent the rest of the exorcism...

1198
01:58:58,784 --> 01:59:00,718
...with her underneath this white sheet...

1199
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:04,014
...you know, wrapped around
this white sheet tied to a chair.

1200
01:59:06,025 --> 01:59:09,654
And then, you know, for that moment where
she starts coughing and hacking up blood.

1201
01:59:11,363 --> 01:59:14,423
You know, she coughs up the blood,
but because the sheets are in her face...

1202
01:59:14,667 --> 01:59:18,603
...the blood sprays onto the inside
of the sheet and so it adds this extra...

1203
01:59:18,838 --> 01:59:21,671
...really sort of gritty layer to it,
to what's going on.

1204
01:59:21,874 --> 01:59:25,002
And I think it just makes it really creepy.

1205
01:59:42,394 --> 01:59:46,057
The key is to, you know,
make a scary film...

1206
01:59:46,265 --> 01:59:50,258
...that has a lasting impact and that
affects people way after the film is over.
