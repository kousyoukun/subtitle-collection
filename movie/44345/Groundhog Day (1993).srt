1
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:56,502
<i>Somebody asked me today:</i>

2
00:00:56,752 --> 00:01:00,006
<i>"Phil, if you could be anywhere in the
world, where would you like to be?"</i>

3
00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:02,800
And I said to him,
"Probably right here

4
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,137
Elko, Nevada."
Our nation's high at 79 today.

5
00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:09,056
Out in California, they're going to have
some warm weather tomorrow,

6
00:01:09,307 --> 00:01:11,934
gang wars and some very
overpriced real estate.

7
00:01:12,184 --> 00:01:15,021
Up in the Pacific Northwest, as you can
see, they're going to have some

8
00:01:15,313 --> 00:01:16,939
very, very tall trees.

9
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:19,734
It will be clear across the Rockies
and the Great Plains mostly.

10
00:01:19,684 --> 00:01:22,103
But look out, here comes trouble.

11
00:01:24,272 --> 00:01:25,315
Oh, boy!

12
00:01:25,898 --> 00:01:27,692
Front coming our way!
Look out!

13
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:31,738
What's that going to mean to us
here in the Three Rivers area?
One of these big blue things!

14
00:01:31,988 --> 00:01:35,867
This cold, frigid arctic air,
this big mass coming out of the north.

15
00:01:36,784 --> 00:01:40,079
It's going to meet up with all of this
moisture coming up out of the Gulf.

16
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,707
They're going to mix together at high
altitudes and cause some snow.

17
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:48,421
Going out on a limb now: Not
going to hit us here in Pittsburgh.
Going to push off and hit Altoona.

18
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:50,014
Close call, folks!

19
00:01:50,264 --> 00:01:51,932
Let's take a look at the five-day.

20
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,261
As you can see, nothing to be
too scared about.

21
00:01:55,762 --> 00:01:59,223
Bundle up warm, of course, but I think
you can leave your galoshes at home.

22
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:02,185
I'm not going to be here for the 10:00.
Tomorrow's Groundhog Day

23
00:02:02,435 --> 00:02:06,939
and I'm going out to Punxsutawney for our
country's oldest Groundhog Festival.

24
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,401
So, as you know, according to the
legend, tomorrow, February 2nd

25
00:02:10,693 --> 00:02:13,404
if the groundhog wakes
and sees his shadow

26
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:15,740
we've got six more weeks of winter to look
forward to, so keep your fingers crossed.

27
00:02:16,532 --> 00:02:17,575
Sounds like a lot of fun.

28
00:02:17,825 --> 00:02:21,370
You must really enjoy it. This is your
third year in a row, isn't it Phil?

29
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,872
Four, Nan.

30
00:02:23,122 --> 00:02:24,081
Four.

31
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:25,499
Thanks, Phil.

32
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:30,421
Up next, our entertainment editor,
Diane Kingman, looks at sex
and violence in the movies.

33
00:02:30,671 --> 00:02:31,755
Stay with us.

34
00:02:34,842 --> 00:02:35,884
We're clear.

35
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:38,012
Have fun in Punxsutawney, Phil.

36
00:02:39,013 --> 00:02:44,018
For your information, hairdo, there is
a major network interested in me.

37
00:02:44,268 --> 00:02:46,895
Yeah. That would be the
Home Shopping Network.

38
00:02:48,272 --> 00:02:50,941
Thanks, Larry.
Go wait in the van, will you?

39
00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:54,028
That was nice, Phil.
"Big trees"!

40
00:02:54,278 --> 00:02:55,154
Stop, Kenny.

41
00:02:55,362 --> 00:02:58,032
Look, can you handle
the 10 or not?

42
00:02:57,865 --> 00:03:01,911
Listen, if for any reason you don't want
to rush back, I can do the 5 tomorrow.

43
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:05,123
Oh, come on! You think I want to stay an
extra second in Punxsutawney? Please!

44
00:03:05,873 --> 00:03:08,083
Look, Rita thinks it would be
a great idea

45
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:11,712
to stay around for some of the other events.
You know, get some incredible footage

46
00:03:11,962 --> 00:03:14,298
of the people and the fun.
The excitement!

47
00:03:14,548 --> 00:03:17,718
You haven't worked with her yet, have you?
She's really nice.

48
00:03:17,926 --> 00:03:21,096
I think she's going to be
a really good producer.

49
00:03:21,347 --> 00:03:23,766
You guys are going to have fun.

50
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,730
She's fun. But not my kind of fun.
I will be here for the 5.

51
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:30,731
Rita!

52
00:03:59,232 --> 00:04:03,232
#  Predictions show
a steady low  #

53
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:07,733
#  You're feeling just the same  #

54
00:04:08,434 --> 00:04:12,934
#  But seasons come
and seasons go  #

55
00:04:13,135 --> 00:04:17,135
#  I'll make you smile again  #

56
00:04:17,636 --> 00:04:21,636
#  If you don't believe me
take me by the hand  #

57
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:29,137
#  Can't you feel you're warming up,
yeah, I'm your weatherman  #

58
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:34,336
Can you keep a secret, Larry?

59
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:37,047
I'm probably leaving PBH.

60
00:04:37,506 --> 00:04:40,134
So this will be the last time

61
00:04:40,467 --> 00:04:41,969
we do the groundhog together.

62
00:04:42,803 --> 00:04:45,472
I don't understand what's wrong with
the Groundhog Festival?

63
00:04:45,722 --> 00:04:46,807
You know, when I worked in San Diego

64
00:04:47,057 --> 00:04:50,727
I covered the swallows returning to
Capistrano six years in a row.

65
00:04:51,395 --> 00:04:55,566
Someday, somebody's going to see
me interviewing a groundhog and
think I don't have a future.

66
00:04:55,774 --> 00:04:57,860
I think it's a nice story.

67
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,904
He comes out.
He looks around.

68
00:05:01,113 --> 00:05:02,865
He wrinkles up his little nose.

69
00:05:03,115 --> 00:05:06,910
He sees his shadow, he doesn't see his
shadow. It's nice! People like it!

70
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,538
You are new, aren't you?

71
00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:12,416
You know, people like
blood sausage, too.

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,167
People are morons!

73
00:05:14,793 --> 00:05:16,420
Nice attitude.

74
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:21,008
I want you to look in the mirror and
see what you look like when you do
that little groundhog thing, okay?

75
00:05:21,258 --> 00:05:22,426
For me? Once?

76
00:05:22,634 --> 00:05:26,430
He comes out, and there he
looks at his little shadow.

77
00:05:27,848 --> 00:05:29,425
Would you like some blood sausage?

78
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:33,426
- I have some here in the glove compartment.
- I like blood sausage.

79
00:05:34,427 --> 00:05:38,427
#  They say it's gone,
say winter's done  #

80
00:05:39,428 --> 00:05:42,428
#  That don't mean a thing  #

81
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:48,129
#  'Cause I'm the one,
that moves the sun  #

82
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,630
#  For you I'd turn it into spring  #

83
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:57,131
#  So when you're feeling lonely,
try to understand  #

84
00:05:57,632 --> 00:06:03,632
#  Baby, I can warm you up,
'cause I'm your weatherman  #

85
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:16,133
#  Just ask the weatherman  #

86
00:06:20,134 --> 00:06:23,134
#  'Cause I'm you're weatherman  #

87
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:32,663
Rita, I can't stay here.

88
00:06:34,206 --> 00:06:35,457
- Prima donna.
- Yeah, I know.

89
00:06:36,124 --> 00:06:37,918
- What's the matter, Phil?
- I hate this place.

90
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:40,796
I stayed here two years ago.
I was miserable. It's a fleabag.

91
00:06:41,004 --> 00:06:43,632
- I'm not staying here.
- You're not staying here.

92
00:06:43,882 --> 00:06:45,508
- I'm not?
- No.

93
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:46,960
Larry's just dropping me off.

94
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:49,461
I've booked you in a very nice bed
and breakfast in Cherry Street.

95
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:52,265
Great.

96
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:56,686
You know, I think this is one of the
traits of a really good producer.

97
00:06:56,978 --> 00:06:58,647
Keep the talent happy.

98
00:06:59,064 --> 00:07:00,357
Anything I can do.

99
00:07:00,732 --> 00:07:03,151
Would you help me with
my pelvic tilt?

100
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,698
Within reason. Would you like to come
to dinner with Larry and me?

101
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:12,119
No, thank you.
I've seen Larry eat.

102
00:07:14,538 --> 00:07:17,249
You get your sleep.
I'll see you in the morning.

103
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,501
Don't be late.

104
00:07:21,795 --> 00:07:24,297
Did he actually call himself
"the talent"?

105
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:36,598
#  And put your little hand in mine  #

106
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:42,799
#  There ain't no hill or mountain
we can't climb  #

107
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,100
#  Babe  #

108
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:48,101
#  I got you, Babe  #

109
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,402
#  I got you, Babe  #

110
00:07:52,576 --> 00:07:56,037
<i>Okay, campers, rise and shine!
And don't forget your booties.</i>

111
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:59,082
<i>- 'Cause it's cold out there today!
- It's cold out there every day!</i>

112
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,585
<i>- What is this, Miami Beach?
- Not hardly!</i>

113
00:08:01,835 --> 00:08:04,629
<i>And you know, you can expect hazardous
travel later today with</i>

114
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,298
<i>that blizzard thing.</i>

115
00:08:06,548 --> 00:08:09,676
<i>That blizzard thing. That blizzard thing.
Oh, well, here's the report.</i>

116
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:14,264
<i>The National Weather Service is
calling for a big blizzard thing.</i>

117
00:08:14,472 --> 00:08:17,267
<i>Yes, they are. But you know, there's another
reason why today's especially exciting</i>

118
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:19,227
<i>- Especially cold.
- Especially cold.</i>

119
00:08:19,436 --> 00:08:21,897
<i>Oh, okay, but the big question
on everybody's lips</i>

120
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:24,816
<i>- Yeah, their chapped lips.
- On their chapped lips. You got that right.</i>

121
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:27,652
<i>Do you think Phil's going to come
out and see his shadow?</i>

122
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:31,197
<i>- Punxsutawney Phil!
- That's right, woodchuck chuckers!</i>

123
00:08:31,448 --> 00:08:32,866
<i>It's Groundhog Day!</i>

124
00:08:33,116 --> 00:08:36,161
<i>Get up and chuck me a
hog out there! Yah!</i>

125
00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:38,162
<i>- Soo-ee! Soo-ee!
- Come here, groundhog!</i>

126
00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:41,374
- Morning!
- Morning.

127
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,810
- You off to see the groundhog?
- Yes, I am.

128
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,004
You think it's going to
be an early spring?

129
00:08:46,212 --> 00:08:48,298
I'm predicting March 21st.

130
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:50,759
Good guess!

131
00:08:51,217 --> 00:08:54,638
You know, I think that actually is
the first day of spring.

132
00:09:01,895 --> 00:09:05,899
- Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?
- I slept alone, Mrs. Lancaster.

133
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,401
Would you like some coffee?

134
00:09:08,652 --> 00:09:13,114
I don't suppose there's any possibility
of getting an espresso or a cappuccino
this morning, is there?

135
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:15,325
Oh, I really don't know.

136
00:09:15,617 --> 00:09:19,162
How to spell espresso or cappuccino.
This looks fine.

137
00:09:19,412 --> 00:09:21,581
I hope you enjoy the festivities.

138
00:09:21,831 --> 00:09:25,085
- Oh, yeah, I'm sure I'm going to.
- There's uh, there's talk of a blizzard.

139
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:28,838
Well, we may catch a break and that
blizzard's going to blow right by us.

140
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:31,257
All of this moisture coming up
out of the south

141
00:09:31,508 --> 00:09:33,718
by midday is probably going to
push on to the east of us.

142
00:09:33,927 --> 00:09:38,932
And at high altitudes it's going to
crystallize and give us what we call snow.
Probably be some accumulation.

143
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,936
But here in Punxsutawney, our high's going
to get up to about 30 today, teens tonight.

144
00:09:43,144 --> 00:09:46,898
Chance of precipitation about
20 per cent today, 20 per cent tomorrow.

145
00:09:47,148 --> 00:09:50,151
Did you want to talk about the weather
or were you just making chitchat?

146
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:52,112
Chitchat.

147
00:09:52,362 --> 00:09:53,905
See you later.

148
00:09:54,406 --> 00:09:55,406
Goodbye.

149
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,369
Will you be checking out today,
Mr. Connors?

150
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:01,913
Chance of departure today,
100 per cent.

151
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:21,101
Phil?

152
00:10:21,102 --> 00:10:23,502
Hey!
Phil.

153
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:24,601
Phil!

154
00:10:24,602 --> 00:10:27,105
Phil Connors! Phil Connors,
I thought that was you!

155
00:10:27,313 --> 00:10:29,607
- Hi. How you doing? Thanks for watching.
- Hey. Hey!

156
00:10:29,858 --> 00:10:34,362
Now don't you tell me you don't remember me
because I sure as heckfire remember you.

157
00:10:35,405 --> 00:10:36,531
Not a chance.

158
00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:38,158
Ned!

159
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,952
Ryerson!

160
00:10:41,786 --> 00:10:43,538
Needlenose Ned.
Ned the Head.

161
00:10:43,746 --> 00:10:46,166
Come on, buddy,
Case Western High!

162
00:10:46,374 --> 00:10:50,295
Ned Ryerson. I did the whistling bellybutton
trick at the high school talent show.

163
00:10:50,545 --> 00:10:55,425
Bing! Ned Ryerson. I got the shingles real
bad senior year. Almost didn't graduate.

164
00:10:55,717 --> 00:10:57,594
Bing again!

165
00:10:57,802 --> 00:11:01,890
Ned Ryerson. I dated your sister, Mary Pat, a
couple times till you told me not to anymore.

166
00:11:02,098 --> 00:11:03,391
Well?

167
00:11:04,225 --> 00:11:05,101
Ned Ryerson?

168
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:06,311
Bing!

169
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:07,854
Bing.

170
00:11:08,688 --> 00:11:11,608
So, did you turn pro with that
bellybutton thing, Ned, or what?

171
00:11:11,816 --> 00:11:13,193
No, Phil, I sell insurance.

172
00:11:13,443 --> 00:11:15,695
- What a shock.
- Do you have life insurance?

173
00:11:15,904 --> 00:11:17,864
'Cause if you do, you could
always use a little more.

174
00:11:18,072 --> 00:11:20,700
Am I right, or am I right,
or am I right?

175
00:11:21,534 --> 00:11:22,534
Ned.

176
00:11:22,535 --> 00:11:25,496
I would love to stand here
and talk with you.

177
00:11:25,705 --> 00:11:26,998
But I'm not going to.

178
00:11:27,248 --> 00:11:28,208
See you.

179
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,293
Hey, that's all right!
I'll walk with you.

180
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:33,421
You know, whenever I see an
opportunity now, I charge it like a bull.

181
00:11:33,671 --> 00:11:35,506
Ned the Bull, that's me now.

182
00:11:35,757 --> 00:11:39,302
You know, I got friends of mine who
live and die by the actuarial tables.

183
00:11:39,552 --> 00:11:42,597
And I say, "Hey! It's all one big
crap shoot anyhoo."

184
00:11:42,805 --> 00:11:47,727
Tell me. Have you ever heard of single
premium life? Because I think that
really could be the ticket for you.

185
00:11:47,977 --> 00:11:49,395
Oh, God!

186
00:11:49,646 --> 00:11:53,566
It is so good to see you!
Oh. What are you doing for dinner?

187
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:55,109
Something else.

188
00:11:55,318 --> 00:11:58,821
It's been great seeing you,
Needlehead. Take care.

189
00:12:02,992 --> 00:12:06,621
Watch out for that first step.
It's a doozy!

190
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,724
#  Strike up the music
the band has begun  #

191
00:12:16,825 --> 00:12:19,825
#  The Pennsylvania Polka  #

192
00:12:20,426 --> 00:12:23,426
#  Pick out your partner
and join in the fun  #

193
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:27,227
#  The Pennsylvania Polka  #

194
00:12:27,928 --> 00:12:30,928
#  It started in Scranton
It's now number one  #

195
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:34,929
#  It's bound to entertain ya  #

196
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:36,809
#  Everybody has a mania  #
- Hey, Phil!

197
00:12:36,818 --> 00:12:38,444
#  Everybody has a mania  #
- Phil, over here!

198
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:40,354
#  to do the polka from Pennsylvania  #
- Where have you been?

199
00:12:40,405 --> 00:12:41,948
#  to do the polka from Pennsylvania  #
- It was horrible.

200
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:44,117
A giant leech got me.

201
00:12:44,617 --> 00:12:46,953
Well, you're missing all the fun.
These people are great!

202
00:12:47,203 --> 00:12:50,832
Some of them been partying all night long.
They sing songs till they get too cold.

203
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,668
And then they go sit by the fire
and then they get warm.

204
00:12:53,876 --> 00:12:56,295
And then they come back and
they sing some more!

205
00:12:56,296 --> 00:12:58,296
Yeah.
They're hicks, Rita.

206
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:02,093
So. Did you sleep okay without me?

207
00:13:02,343 --> 00:13:04,095
You tossed and turned, didn't you?

208
00:13:04,303 --> 00:13:05,513
You're incredible.

209
00:13:05,847 --> 00:13:06,973
Who told you?

210
00:13:07,474 --> 00:13:08,474
Okay.

211
00:13:09,016 --> 00:13:10,768
It's groundhog time.

212
00:13:14,105 --> 00:13:15,898
Okay.
On me in three,

213
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:17,817
two, one.

214
00:13:18,776 --> 00:13:23,531
Once a year, the eyes of the nation turn to
this tiny hamlet in Western Pennsylvania

215
00:13:23,781 --> 00:13:25,408
to watch a master at work.

216
00:13:25,658 --> 00:13:26,576
The master?

217
00:13:26,826 --> 00:13:28,161
Punxsutawney Phil

218
00:13:28,411 --> 00:13:31,706
the world's most famous weatherman.
The groundhog.

219
00:13:31,956 --> 00:13:36,085
Who, as legend has it, can predict
the coming of an early spring.

220
00:13:36,335 --> 00:13:39,005
So, I guess the question we have
to ask ourselves today is:

221
00:13:39,255 --> 00:13:41,257
"Does Phil feel lucky?"

222
00:13:43,384 --> 00:13:47,513
Then it's the same old schtick every year.
The guy comes with a big stick
and raps on the door.

223
00:13:47,722 --> 00:13:50,475
They pull the little rat out.
They talk to him.

224
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:55,020
The rat talks back. And then they
tell us when it's going to end.

225
00:14:00,443 --> 00:14:02,236
Awww! Isn't he cute?

226
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,700
Do you like your guys with the
prominent upper teeth?

227
00:14:07,701 --> 00:14:08,701
No!

228
00:14:18,211 --> 00:14:22,131
This February 2nd, at 7:20
and 30 seconds

229
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,799
Punxsutawney Phil

230
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,593
the seer of seers

231
00:14:25,843 --> 00:14:28,804
prognosticator of prognosticators

232
00:14:29,096 --> 00:14:31,015
emerged reluctantly

233
00:14:31,265 --> 00:14:32,308
but alertly

234
00:14:32,516 --> 00:14:34,560
in Punxsutawney, PA

235
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:37,480
and stated in groundhog-ese

236
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,899
"I definitely see a shadow."

237
00:14:42,777 --> 00:14:43,736
Sorry, folks.

238
00:14:43,986 --> 00:14:46,572
Six more weeks of winter.

239
00:14:52,036 --> 00:14:52,954
On me in three,

240
00:14:53,162 --> 00:14:54,830
two, one.

241
00:14:56,207 --> 00:14:58,501
This is one time where
television really fails

242
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:01,587
to capture the true excitement
of a large squirrel

243
00:15:01,837 --> 00:15:03,047
predicting the weather.

244
00:15:03,297 --> 00:15:06,592
I, for one, am grateful to have been here.
From Punxsutawney

245
00:15:06,842 --> 00:15:09,512
this is Phil Connors.
So long.

246
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,889
Okay. Want to try it again
without the sarcasm?

247
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:14,684
We got it.
I'm out of here.

248
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:17,228
Prima donnas.

249
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:33,035
Oh, boy.
Take a look at this.

250
00:15:33,661 --> 00:15:35,329
What is going on?

251
00:15:35,538 --> 00:15:39,500
I don't know, Phil. Perhaps it's that giant
blizzard we're not supposed to get.

252
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:41,627
This is impossible.

253
00:15:41,928 --> 00:15:43,428
Hey, hey, hey!
No, no, no.

254
00:15:43,546 --> 00:15:46,632
Nobody honks this horn but me,
okay, pal?

255
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:51,733
No.

256
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,034
No!

257
00:16:08,028 --> 00:16:09,530
Take this thing out of here.

258
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,366
Hey, Commander, what's going on?

259
00:16:12,616 --> 00:16:14,744
There's nothing going on.
We're closing the road.

260
00:16:14,994 --> 00:16:18,581
- Big blizzard moving in.
- What blizzard? It's a couple of flakes.

261
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:21,500
Don't you listen to the weather?
We got a major storm here.

262
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:23,711
I make the weather.

263
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,924
All this moisture coming up out of the Gulf
is going to push off to the east, into Altoona.

264
00:16:29,216 --> 00:16:31,635
Pal, you got that moisture
on your head.

265
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:33,846
Now, you can go back
to Punxsutawney,

266
00:16:34,513 --> 00:16:37,391
or you can go ahead and freeze to death.
It's your choice.

267
00:16:37,725 --> 00:16:39,769
So, what's it going to be?

268
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,898
I'm thinking.

269
00:16:44,523 --> 00:16:48,110
Come on, all the long-distance
lines are down?

270
00:16:48,944 --> 00:16:50,404
What about the satellite?

271
00:16:50,654 --> 00:16:52,573
Is it snowing in space?

272
00:16:53,441 --> 00:16:57,778
Don't you have some kind of a line that you
keep open for emergencies or for celebrities?

273
00:16:59,205 --> 00:17:02,583
I'm both.
I'm a celebrity in an emergency.

274
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:05,586
Can you patch me through
on that line please?

275
00:17:12,843 --> 00:17:16,055
Could I have one more of these
with some booze in it, please?

276
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:18,766
Ooh, I like it here.

277
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:19,767
Phil!

278
00:17:20,226 --> 00:17:22,228
You going to the groundhog dinner?

279
00:17:22,478 --> 00:17:24,188
No, I had groundhog for lunch.

280
00:17:24,396 --> 00:17:26,690
Wasn't bad.
Tastes like chicken.

281
00:17:26,899 --> 00:17:27,816
You two run along.

282
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:29,317
Wow!

283
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,196
Looking foxy tonight, man.
Hey!

284
00:17:32,738 --> 00:17:35,908
Is your troop going to be selling
cookies again this year?

285
00:17:36,158 --> 00:17:37,451
That's so funny, Phil.

286
00:17:37,785 --> 00:17:39,161
So, what are you going to do?

287
00:17:39,703 --> 00:17:41,914
I think I'm going to go back
to my room and

288
00:17:42,164 --> 00:17:45,709
take a hot shower and maybe
read Hustler or something.

289
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:47,336
Suit yourself.

290
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,064
Yo, mom.

291
00:18:07,314 --> 00:18:09,024
Isn't there any hot water?

292
00:18:09,275 --> 00:18:11,151
Oh, no, there wouldn't be today.

293
00:18:11,402 --> 00:18:13,862
Of course not.
Silly me.

294
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:15,531
Sweet dreams.

295
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:23,598
# And put your little hand in mine #

296
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:29,799
# There ain't no hill or mountain
we can't climb #

297
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,100
# Babe #

298
00:18:33,101 --> 00:18:35,101
# I got you, Babe #

299
00:18:36,402 --> 00:18:38,402
# I got you, Babe #

300
00:18:39,221 --> 00:18:42,682
<i>Okay, campers, rise and shine!
And don't forget your booties.</i>

301
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:45,727
<i>- 'Cause it's cold out there today!
- It's cold out there every day!</i>

302
00:18:45,936 --> 00:18:48,030
<i>- What is this, Miami Beach?
- Not hardly!</i>

303
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:51,400
Nice going, boys.
You're playing yesterday's tape.

304
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,068
<i>that blizzard thing.</i>

305
00:18:53,318 --> 00:18:56,446
<i>That blizzard thing. That blizzard thing.
Oh, well, here's the report.</i>

306
00:18:56,696 --> 00:19:01,034
<i>The National Weather Service is
calling for a big blizzard thing.</i>

307
00:19:01,242 --> 00:19:04,037
<i>Yes, they are. But you know, there's another
reason why today's especially exciting</i>

308
00:19:04,245 --> 00:19:05,997
<i>- Especially cold.
- Especially cold.</i>

309
00:19:06,206 --> 00:19:08,667
<i>Oh, okay, but the big question
on everybody's lips</i>

310
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:11,668
- Chapped lips.
- Yeah, their chapped lips.
- You got that right.

311
00:19:11,795 --> 00:19:14,422
<i>Do you think Phil's going to come
out and see his shadow?</i>

312
00:19:14,673 --> 00:19:17,967
<i>- Punxsutawney Phil!
- That's right, woodchuck chuckers!</i>

313
00:19:18,218 --> 00:19:19,636
<i>It's Groundhog Day!</i>

314
00:19:19,886 --> 00:19:22,931
<i>Get up and chuck me a
hog out there! Yah!</i>

315
00:19:22,932 --> 00:19:24,932
<i>- Soo-ee! Soo-ee!
- Come here, groundhog!</i>

316
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,353
What the hell?

317
00:19:36,403 --> 00:19:39,323
Morning!
Off to see the groundhog?

318
00:19:39,948 --> 00:19:40,948
Yeah.

319
00:19:40,949 --> 00:19:43,201
Think it'll be an early spring?

320
00:19:43,577 --> 00:19:45,454
Didn't we do this yesterday?

321
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,539
I don't know what you mean.

322
00:19:48,457 --> 00:19:50,459
Don't mess with me, porkchop!

323
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:53,921
- What day is this?
- It's February 2nd.

324
00:19:54,254 --> 00:19:55,714
Groundhog Day.

325
00:19:56,715 --> 00:19:57,715
Yeah.

326
00:19:58,634 --> 00:20:01,553
I'm sorry. You know,
I thought it was yesterday.

327
00:20:01,554 --> 00:20:02,554
Oh.

328
00:20:23,992 --> 00:20:26,078
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

329
00:20:26,662 --> 00:20:28,372
Did I sleep well?

330
00:20:28,664 --> 00:20:30,332
Would you like some coffee?

331
00:20:30,582 --> 00:20:33,252
Yes, please.
I think I'll have a double.

332
00:20:33,544 --> 00:20:35,921
I hope you enjoy the festivities.

333
00:20:36,338 --> 00:20:38,590
There's talk of a blizzard.

334
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,428
Do you ever have déjà vu,
Mrs. Lancaster?

335
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,306
I don't think so, but I could
check with the kitchen.

336
00:20:46,598 --> 00:20:48,475
No, that's okay.
Thank you.

337
00:20:49,935 --> 00:20:52,604
Will you be checking out today,
Mr. Connors?

338
00:20:54,898 --> 00:20:59,194
I'd say the chance
of departure is 80 percent.

339
00:21:00,404 --> 00:21:02,114
75 to 80.

340
00:21:07,327 --> 00:21:08,787
Excuse me!

341
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:11,832
Excuse me.
Where's everybody going?

342
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,875
To Gobbler's Knob.

343
00:21:14,084 --> 00:21:15,335
It's Groundhog Day.

344
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:18,588
It's still just once a year,
isn't it?

345
00:21:26,102 --> 00:21:28,502
Hey!
Phil.

346
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:29,601
Phil!

347
00:21:29,602 --> 00:21:33,405
Hey! Phil Connors!
I thought that was you!

348
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:35,731
My, oh my, Phil Connors!

349
00:21:35,981 --> 00:21:39,901
Now don't say you don't remember me
because I sure as heckfire remember you.

350
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,612
- Well?
- Ned Ryerson?

351
00:21:42,863 --> 00:21:46,199
Bing! Oh! First shot right
out of the box!

352
00:21:46,408 --> 00:21:49,036
So how's it going, old buddy?

353
00:21:49,328 --> 00:21:52,164
Well, uh, to tell you the truth, Neddy, I'm
not feeling real well. Would you excuse me?

354
00:21:52,414 --> 00:21:57,210
Well, you know, it's funny you should
mention your health because you
will never guess what I do now.

355
00:21:57,461 --> 00:21:59,463
Do you sell insurance?

356
00:21:59,755 --> 00:22:02,591
Bing again!
You are sharp as a tack today!

357
00:22:02,841 --> 00:22:04,676
Do you have life insurance, Phil?

358
00:22:04,926 --> 00:22:07,220
Because if you do, you could
always use a little more.

359
00:22:07,471 --> 00:22:09,389
Right! I mean, who couldn't?

360
00:22:09,639 --> 00:22:10,974
But you want to know something?

361
00:22:11,224 --> 00:22:13,226
I gots a feeling

362
00:22:13,727 --> 00:22:15,145
you ain't got any.

363
00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:18,231
Am I right, or am I right,
or am I right?

364
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,116
- I got to go.
- Phil!

365
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:28,241
Watch out for that first step,
it's a doozy!

366
00:22:33,024 --> 00:22:36,224
#  Strike up the music
the band has begun  #

367
00:22:37,325 --> 00:22:40,325
#  The Pennsylvania Polka  #

368
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,926
#  Pick out your partner
and join in the fun  #

369
00:22:44,727 --> 00:22:47,727
#  The Pennsylvania Polka  #

370
00:22:48,428 --> 00:22:51,428
#  It started in Scranton
It's now number one  #

371
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:55,429
- Phil! Phil, over here!
#  It's bound to entertain ya  #

372
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:58,309
#  Everybody has a mania  #
- Where have you been?

373
00:22:58,318 --> 00:23:00,244
#  Everybody has a mania  #
- Rita. Do me a favor.

374
00:23:00,315 --> 00:23:03,443
I need someone to give me a
good, hard slap in the face.

375
00:23:05,111 --> 00:23:06,530
How's that?

376
00:23:06,738 --> 00:23:07,572
Good!

377
00:23:08,073 --> 00:23:11,535
If you need any help with the other cheek,
let me know, I'm right here.

378
00:23:13,203 --> 00:23:14,663
Something's going on and I
don't know what to do.

379
00:23:14,955 --> 00:23:17,624
- Are you drunk or something?
- Drunk's more fun.

380
00:23:17,874 --> 00:23:19,876
Can I be serious with you
for a minute?

381
00:23:20,085 --> 00:23:21,211
I don't know. Can you?

382
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:23,255
Yes! I'm being serious!

383
00:23:23,505 --> 00:23:27,509
I'm having a problem.
I may be having a problem.

384
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,710
Rita. Rita.

385
00:23:28,802 --> 00:23:29,970
It's groundhog time.

386
00:23:30,178 --> 00:23:32,430
See? I knew you were
going to say that!

387
00:23:32,848 --> 00:23:34,391
I really feel

388
00:23:34,641 --> 00:23:36,059
weird.

389
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:39,103
Let's just do this, Phil.
Then we'll talk.

390
00:23:40,814 --> 00:23:42,399
All right, on me in three,

391
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:44,442
two, one.

392
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:46,778
Well, it's Groundhog Day

393
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:48,363
again

394
00:23:48,613 --> 00:23:51,491
and that must mean that we're
up here at Gobbler's Knob

395
00:23:51,741 --> 00:23:55,495
waiting for the world's most famous
groundhog/weatherman

396
00:23:55,704 --> 00:23:57,038
Punxsutawney Phil

397
00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:01,251
who's just about to tell us how much
more winter we can expect.

398
00:24:06,965 --> 00:24:08,341
This is a riot!

399
00:24:10,886 --> 00:24:13,054
Awww. Isn't he cute?

400
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:18,059
This February 2nd, at 7:20
and 30 seconds

401
00:24:18,643 --> 00:24:21,980
Punxsutawney Phil,
the seer of seers

402
00:24:22,522 --> 00:24:25,066
prognosticator of prognosticators

403
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:27,277
- emerged reluctantly
- Phil!

404
00:24:27,527 --> 00:24:29,779
but alertly in Punxsu--

405
00:24:32,282 --> 00:24:34,326
Oh, my gosh!

406
00:24:36,911 --> 00:24:38,913
Yeah, sport, I know there's a blizzard.

407
00:24:39,164 --> 00:24:42,250
When are the long-distance
lines going to be repaired?

408
00:24:44,127 --> 00:24:48,298
Well, what if there is no tomorrow?
There wasn't one today.

409
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,299
Hello?

410
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,500
Hello!?

411
00:25:22,098 --> 00:25:25,598
#  And put your little hand in mine  #

412
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:31,799
#  There ain't no hill or mountain
we can't climb  #

413
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,100
#  Babe  #

414
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:37,101
#  I got you, Babe  #

415
00:25:38,402 --> 00:25:40,402
#  I got you, Babe  #

416
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:46,397
Morning!

417
00:25:46,648 --> 00:25:48,191
Off to see the groundhog?

418
00:25:54,781 --> 00:25:56,866
Oh. Did you sleep well, Mr.

419
00:26:09,838 --> 00:26:10,838
Hey, Phil!

420
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:13,383
Phil Connors! I thought

421
00:26:14,926 --> 00:26:18,179
Don't say you don't remember me because
I sure as heckfire remember you!

422
00:26:18,388 --> 00:26:20,473
It's me, Ned! Ryerson!

423
00:26:20,682 --> 00:26:23,184
Needlenose Ned! Ned the Head!
Come on, buddy, Case Western High.

424
00:26:23,685 --> 00:26:25,685
Hey, look--
Heyyy!

425
00:26:25,926 --> 00:26:29,226
#  Pick out your partner and join in the fun  #
- Phil! Phil! Over here!

426
00:26:29,727 --> 00:26:31,427
#  The Pennsylvania Polka  #
- Where have you been?

427
00:26:31,484 --> 00:26:34,445
- Can I talk to you about a
matter that is not work-related?

428
00:26:34,654 --> 00:26:37,574
- You never talk about work.
- We really have to talk. Come on.
- Hey!

429
00:26:37,782 --> 00:26:40,910
- It's a creative meeting. Forget it!
- Wait a second. We've got work to do!

430
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:43,538
No. I don't.
I've already done it twice.

431
00:26:43,788 --> 00:26:46,749
Now, when you get finished,
come and meet me in the diner.

432
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,750
Phil!

433
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:52,297
- What's that all about?
- I don't know.

434
00:26:52,547 --> 00:26:54,132
Prima donnas.

435
00:26:57,719 --> 00:26:58,720
More coffee, hon?

436
00:26:58,928 --> 00:27:02,765
No, thanks, just the check, please.
These sticky buns are just Heaven.

437
00:27:02,974 --> 00:27:04,475
Aren't they?

438
00:27:05,852 --> 00:27:08,313
Just put that anywhere, pal!
Yeah!

439
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:10,106
Good save!

440
00:27:11,733 --> 00:27:15,069
Okay, now tell me why you're too sick
to work and it better be good.

441
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:21,070
Rita, I'm re-living the same day
over and over.

442
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:23,870
Groundhog Day. Today.

443
00:27:24,454 --> 00:27:27,624
Okay. I'm waiting for the punch line.

444
00:27:27,915 --> 00:27:30,793
No! Really!
This is the third time!

445
00:27:31,044 --> 00:27:33,004
It's like yesterday never happened!

446
00:27:33,463 --> 00:27:37,216
I am racking my brain, but I can't even
begin to imagine why you'd make
up something like this.

447
00:27:38,134 --> 00:27:40,803
I'm not making it up.
I am asking you for help!

448
00:27:41,471 --> 00:27:43,348
Okay, what do you want me to do?

449
00:27:43,556 --> 00:27:46,893
I don't know! You're a producer.
Come up with something.

450
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:49,729
You want my advice? I think you should
get your head examined

451
00:27:49,979 --> 00:27:53,274
if you expect me to believe a
stupid story like that, Phil!

452
00:27:53,566 --> 00:27:55,276
Phil? Like the groundhog, Phil?

453
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:58,196
Yeah. Like the groundhog, Phil.

454
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,032
Look out for your shadow there, pal!

455
00:28:01,908 --> 00:28:03,826
Morons, your bus is leaving!

456
00:28:04,911 --> 00:28:08,539
You guys ready? We better get going if
we're going to stay ahead of the weather.

457
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:13,336
- Let's talk about it back in Pittsburgh.
- I'm not going back to Pittsburgh.

458
00:28:13,628 --> 00:28:15,838
- Why not?
- Because of the blizzard!

459
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,549
I thought you said that was
going to hit Altoona.

460
00:28:18,758 --> 00:28:21,427
I know that's what I said.

461
00:28:22,095 --> 00:28:24,138
Phil, I think you need help.

462
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:28,517
That's what I've been saying, Rita.
I need help.

463
00:28:28,893 --> 00:28:30,645
Well. No spots.

464
00:28:30,895 --> 00:28:33,356
No clots, no tumors.

465
00:28:33,606 --> 00:28:34,982
No lesions.

466
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:36,776
No aneurysms.

467
00:28:37,026 --> 00:28:38,569
At least none that I can see,
Mr. Connors.

468
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,698
Of course, if you want a CAT scan or an MRI,
you're going to have to go into Pittsburgh.

469
00:28:42,907 --> 00:28:45,118
I can't go into Pittsburgh.

470
00:28:45,368 --> 00:28:48,955
- Why can't you go into Pittsburgh?
- I told you, there's a blizzard.

471
00:28:49,163 --> 00:28:50,414
Oh, right. The blizzard.

472
00:28:50,665 --> 00:28:53,334
You know what you may need,
Mr. Connors?

473
00:28:54,127 --> 00:28:55,461
A biopsy.

474
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,713
A psychiatrist.

475
00:28:59,382 --> 00:29:01,926
That's an unusual problem

476
00:29:02,176 --> 00:29:03,261
Mr. Connors.

477
00:29:05,096 --> 00:29:09,767
Most of my work is with couples, families.
I have an alcoholic now.

478
00:29:12,103 --> 00:29:13,855
Well, you went to college, right?
I mean

479
00:29:14,063 --> 00:29:16,399
It wasn't veterinary
psychology, was it?

480
00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:19,610
Didn't you take some kind of course that
covered this stuff?

481
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:22,321
Yeah. Sort of. I guess.

482
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,741
Abnormal psychology.

483
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,119
So.

484
00:29:29,245 --> 00:29:30,538
What do I do?

485
00:29:31,372 --> 00:29:32,707
I think we should meet again.

486
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:36,168
How's tomorrow for you?

487
00:29:38,421 --> 00:29:39,797
Is that not good?

488
00:29:50,641 --> 00:29:53,436
I was in the Virgin Islands once.

489
00:29:53,686 --> 00:29:55,688
I met a girl.

490
00:29:55,897 --> 00:29:57,189
We ate lobster.

491
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,442
Drank piña coladas.

492
00:29:59,692 --> 00:30:02,236
At sunset, we made love
like sea otters.

493
00:30:06,073 --> 00:30:08,409
That was a pretty good day.

494
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:10,494
Why couldn't I get that day

495
00:30:10,703 --> 00:30:11,829
over

496
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:14,248
and over and over?

497
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:18,419
You know, some guys would look
at this glass and they would say,

498
00:30:18,628 --> 00:30:20,087
"That glass is half empty."

499
00:30:20,338 --> 00:30:24,133
Other guys would say,
"That glass is half full."

500
00:30:24,383 --> 00:30:27,720
I peg you as a "glass is half empty"
kind of guy. Am I right?

501
00:30:29,722 --> 00:30:33,059
What would you do if you were
stuck in one place

502
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:37,229
and every day was exactly the same,
and nothing that you did mattered?

503
00:30:39,815 --> 00:30:42,568
That about sums it up for me.

504
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,160
Good luck.

505
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,828
I'll drop you off.

506
00:30:54,997 --> 00:30:57,208
This thing sticks a little bit.

507
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:58,959
You got to jiggle it.

508
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:01,379
Come on up here, pal.

509
00:31:01,587 --> 00:31:04,048
Come on, give me your keys, pal.
Give me the keys.

510
00:31:04,256 --> 00:31:07,009
Friends don't let friends drive, right?
Come on, stand up here.

511
00:31:07,218 --> 00:31:10,179
Take a deep breath. You feel okay?
Really?

512
00:31:10,429 --> 00:31:11,806
Okay, you're all right.

513
00:31:18,312 --> 00:31:20,981
You want to throw up here or
you want to throw up in the car?

514
00:31:21,357 --> 00:31:23,901
I think, both.

515
00:31:24,902 --> 00:31:25,902
Come on.

516
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:37,039
I really don't think I
should be driving.

517
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:39,166
No, no. I don't, I don't either.

518
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:40,793
Watch your head.

519
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:44,171
Watch your knees.
Don't break anything.

520
00:31:44,422 --> 00:31:46,549
Let's not forget seat belts.

521
00:31:47,508 --> 00:31:48,508
Hey.

522
00:31:48,509 --> 00:31:51,637
Who else could go for some
flapjacks right now?

523
00:31:56,892 --> 00:31:58,602
Let me ask you guys a question.

524
00:31:58,853 --> 00:31:59,728
Shoot.

525
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,232
What if there were no tomorrow?

526
00:32:03,774 --> 00:32:07,069
No tomorrow? That would mean there'd be
no consequences

527
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:08,863
there would be no hangovers.

528
00:32:09,113 --> 00:32:11,574
We could do whatever we wanted!

529
00:32:12,992 --> 00:32:14,368
That's true.

530
00:32:14,577 --> 00:32:17,705
We could do whatever we want.

531
00:32:23,294 --> 00:32:26,839
Hey, Phil, if we wanted to hit
mailboxes we could let Ralph drive!

532
00:32:30,636 --> 00:32:33,636
Oh. Hey.
Hey, Phil.

533
00:32:33,637 --> 00:32:35,222
I think they want you to stop.

534
00:32:35,431 --> 00:32:36,348
Hang on!

535
00:32:42,104 --> 00:32:44,106
It's the same thing
your whole life.

536
00:32:44,565 --> 00:32:47,484
"Clean up your room! Stand up
straight! Pick up your feet!"

537
00:32:47,943 --> 00:32:49,486
"Take it like a man!"

538
00:32:49,695 --> 00:32:51,363
"Be nice to your sister!"

539
00:32:52,197 --> 00:32:54,700
"Don't mix beer and wine, ever!"

540
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:56,192
Oh, yeah.

541
00:32:56,493 --> 00:32:58,704
"Don't drive on the
railroad tracks!"

542
00:32:58,788 --> 00:32:59,988
Well, Phil.

543
00:33:00,289 --> 00:33:01,582
That's one I happen to agree with.

544
00:33:11,175 --> 00:33:13,302
I don't know, Gus.

545
00:33:13,552 --> 00:33:16,305
Sometimes I think you just have to

546
00:33:16,555 --> 00:33:18,933
take the big chances.

547
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,518
<i>This is the police!
Pull over immediately!</i>

548
00:33:22,895 --> 00:33:25,105
Hey, we're talking in here!

549
00:33:25,606 --> 00:33:26,606
Phil.

550
00:33:26,607 --> 00:33:28,107
Uh, uh, Phil.

551
00:33:28,108 --> 00:33:30,108
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

552
00:33:30,277 --> 00:33:32,196
I'm betting he's going
to swerve first.

553
00:33:35,197 --> 00:33:36,197
Phil!

554
00:33:37,198 --> 00:33:40,198
Phillllll!!!!!

555
00:33:46,418 --> 00:33:49,713
I'm not going to live by
their rules anymore!

556
00:33:49,922 --> 00:33:51,548
I noticed that.

557
00:33:51,757 --> 00:33:54,301
You make choices and
you live with them.

558
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,025
My knee!

559
00:34:12,903 --> 00:34:14,697
Let me handle this.

560
00:34:16,282 --> 00:34:20,035
Yeah, uh, three cheeseburgers,
two large fries

561
00:34:20,285 --> 00:34:22,287
two chocolate shakes
and one large Coke.

562
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:24,498
And some flapjacks!

563
00:34:24,748 --> 00:34:26,583
Too early for flapjacks?

564
00:34:32,598 --> 00:34:36,098
#  And put your little hand in mine  #

565
00:34:36,299 --> 00:34:40,099
#  There ain't no hill or mountain
we can't climb  #

566
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,432
Yes!

567
00:34:42,641 --> 00:34:44,309
Rise and shine, campers!

568
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,563
Don't forget your booties 'cause
it's cold out there today!

569
00:34:47,813 --> 00:34:49,189
It's cold out there every day.

570
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,526
What is this, Miami Beach?
Not hardly!

571
00:34:57,114 --> 00:34:58,532
Slept like a baby. Thank you.

572
00:34:58,782 --> 00:35:00,784
I'd love some of your coffee, please.

573
00:35:01,034 --> 00:35:02,828
- I hope
- Flurries moving in a little bit later

574
00:35:03,036 --> 00:35:05,205
but the blizzard's going to hit
outside of town.

575
00:35:05,456 --> 00:35:06,457
Mrs. Lancaster?

576
00:35:06,707 --> 00:35:09,001
Was anybody looking for me
here this morning?

577
00:35:09,251 --> 00:35:12,671
Perhaps a state official?
Maybe a blue hat, gun, nightstick?

578
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,799
Oh, no, no one like that!
Will there be?

579
00:35:16,008 --> 00:35:17,676
Apparently not.

580
00:35:19,803 --> 00:35:23,182
Will you hold my room for me, please?
I'm going to stay an extra day.

581
00:35:29,021 --> 00:35:31,023
Catch you tomorrow, huh, pops.

582
00:35:31,724 --> 00:35:33,024
Hey!

583
00:35:33,025 --> 00:35:34,525
Phil.

584
00:35:34,726 --> 00:35:35,926
Phil.

585
00:35:36,028 --> 00:35:38,239
- Hey. Phil Connors!
- Ned?

586
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:13,440
I like to see a man of advancing years
throwing caution to the wind.

587
00:36:13,649 --> 00:36:15,943
It's inspiring, in a way.

588
00:36:16,735 --> 00:36:19,196
My years are not advancing
as fast as you might think.

589
00:36:19,863 --> 00:36:20,697
More coffee, hon?

590
00:36:21,065 --> 00:36:22,532
Yeah, just keep it coming, please.

591
00:36:22,866 --> 00:36:23,992
Sure thing.

592
00:36:25,827 --> 00:36:28,205
Just put that anywhere, pal!

593
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,831
Good save!

594
00:36:31,917 --> 00:36:35,671
Don't you worry about cholesterol,
lung cancer, love handles?

595
00:36:38,006 --> 00:36:39,716
I don't worry about anything anymore.

596
00:36:40,175 --> 00:36:42,469
What makes you so special?
Everybody worries about something.

597
00:36:42,928 --> 00:36:45,555
Well, that's exactly what makes
me so special.

598
00:36:45,764 --> 00:36:47,557
I don't even have to floss.

599
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,235
What?

600
00:37:00,153 --> 00:37:03,824
"The wretch, concentered all in self"

601
00:37:04,241 --> 00:37:06,576
"Living, shall forfeit fair renown"

602
00:37:06,993 --> 00:37:09,913
"And doubly dying, shall go down"

603
00:37:10,122 --> 00:37:13,125
"To the vile dust from whence he sprung"

604
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:14,751
"Unwept,"

605
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,421
"unhonored, and unsung."

606
00:37:18,046 --> 00:37:20,090
Sir Walter Scott.

607
00:37:23,218 --> 00:37:24,636
What? You don't like poetry?

608
00:37:25,387 --> 00:37:26,763
I love poetry!

609
00:37:26,972 --> 00:37:30,100
I just thought that was Willard Scott.
I was confused.

610
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,061
You think I'm acting like this
because I'm egocentric?

611
00:37:33,311 --> 00:37:36,481
I know you're egocentric.
It's your defining characteristic.

612
00:37:38,734 --> 00:37:42,404
Are you guys ready? We better get going
if we're going to stay ahead of the weather.

613
00:37:42,405 --> 00:37:43,405
Thanks, Larry.

614
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:45,949
Well! Would you like a doggie bag?

615
00:37:46,408 --> 00:37:47,826
No. I'm going to stay here and finish.

616
00:37:48,034 --> 00:37:50,328
I thought you hated this town.

617
00:37:50,537 --> 00:37:52,414
No, it's beginning to grow on me.

618
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:55,041
Larry, quit staring.

619
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:58,253
- These are excellent.
- Bon appétit.

620
00:38:08,722 --> 00:38:10,974
Hey! Did you see the groundhog
this morning?

621
00:38:11,642 --> 00:38:14,311
Uh-huh. I never miss it.

622
00:38:14,603 --> 00:38:16,188
What's your name?

623
00:38:18,064 --> 00:38:20,150
Nancy Taylor. And you are?

624
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:22,903
- What high school did you go to?
- What?

625
00:38:23,111 --> 00:38:24,154
High school.

626
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:28,116
Lincoln, in Pittsburgh.
Who are you?

627
00:38:28,325 --> 00:38:31,536
Who was your 12th grade
English teacher?

628
00:38:31,786 --> 00:38:33,163
Are you kidding?

629
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:35,624
No, no, no, no. In 12th grade,
your English teacher was

630
00:38:35,832 --> 00:38:37,751
Mrs. Walsh.

631
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:41,504
Nancy. Lincoln. Walsh.
Okay.

632
00:38:41,671 --> 00:38:43,715
- Thanks very much.
- Hey!

633
00:38:44,316 --> 00:38:45,816
Hey!

634
00:38:51,724 --> 00:38:54,924
#  Strike up the music
the band has begun  #

635
00:38:56,025 --> 00:38:58,725
#  The Pennsylvania Polka  #

636
00:38:58,813 --> 00:39:00,398
Nancy?

637
00:39:01,274 --> 00:39:03,735
Nancy Taylor!

638
00:39:04,236 --> 00:39:06,446
Lincoln High School!

639
00:39:06,863 --> 00:39:10,200
I sat next to you in
Mrs. Walsh's English class!

640
00:39:10,659 --> 00:39:13,954
- I'm sorry.
- Phil Connors!

641
00:39:14,788 --> 00:39:17,707
- Wow! That's amazing!
- You don't remember me, do you?

642
00:39:20,502 --> 00:39:22,545
I even asked you to the prom.

643
00:39:23,296 --> 00:39:25,548
Phil Connors?

644
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,801
I was short and I've sprouted.

645
00:39:30,763 --> 00:39:32,263
Gosh!

646
00:39:32,264 --> 00:39:33,932
How are you?

647
00:39:34,641 --> 00:39:35,684
Great.

648
00:39:35,934 --> 00:39:37,644
You look terrific!

649
00:39:37,936 --> 00:39:41,106
You look very, very terrific!

650
00:39:42,607 --> 00:39:45,026
Listen, I got to go do this report.

651
00:39:45,235 --> 00:39:46,486
Are you a reporter?

652
00:39:46,695 --> 00:39:49,197
I'm a weatherman with
Channel 9, Pittsburgh.

653
00:39:49,447 --> 00:39:51,366
Wow! Gosh! I should have known!
That's great!

654
00:39:51,658 --> 00:39:53,326
But maybe later we could

655
00:39:53,535 --> 00:39:54,786
Yeah, whatever!

656
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,788
Stay right here.

657
00:39:57,205 --> 00:39:58,875
- Promise me?
- Yes.

658
00:39:58,876 --> 00:40:00,576
- Okay, I'll be right back. Wish me luck!
- Okay.

659
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:02,335
Good luck!

660
00:40:20,228 --> 00:40:21,521
Oh, Phil.

661
00:40:22,564 --> 00:40:23,940
Oh, Rita.

662
00:40:27,819 --> 00:40:29,028
Who's Rita?

663
00:40:29,529 --> 00:40:31,114
How should I know?

664
00:40:31,406 --> 00:40:33,950
What is this,
some kind of one-night stand?

665
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,161
On the contrary, Nancy

666
00:40:36,411 --> 00:40:39,664
I love you.
I've always loved you.

667
00:40:40,457 --> 00:40:42,959
This is going to seem sudden, but

668
00:40:44,335 --> 00:40:46,337
Nancy, will you be my wife?

669
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:50,838
Oh, Phil!

670
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:54,679
Rita.

671
00:40:55,513 --> 00:40:58,016
- Nancy.
- Whatever.

672
00:41:02,479 --> 00:41:04,689
A gust of wind.

673
00:41:06,608 --> 00:41:08,234
A dog barks.

674
00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:11,029
Cue the truck.

675
00:41:18,745 --> 00:41:19,954
Exit Herman.

676
00:41:20,663 --> 00:41:22,540
Walk on to the bank.

677
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:26,836
Exit Felix, and stand there with a
not-so-bright look on your face.

678
00:41:28,755 --> 00:41:30,757
All right, Doris. Come on.

679
00:41:31,424 --> 00:41:34,344
Hey, fix your bra, honey.
That's better.

680
00:41:35,345 --> 00:41:36,763
Felix!

681
00:41:37,013 --> 00:41:38,431
How you doing, Doris?

682
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,226
Can I have a roll of quarters?

683
00:41:42,435 --> 00:41:47,065
Ten, nine, eight

684
00:41:47,774 --> 00:41:49,108
car

685
00:41:49,317 --> 00:41:52,403
six, five

686
00:41:52,654 --> 00:41:54,781
quarters

687
00:41:55,156 --> 00:41:58,743
three, two

688
00:42:06,543 --> 00:42:07,710
Felix?

689
00:42:07,919 --> 00:42:11,506
- Did I bring out two bags or one?
- I don't know.

690
00:42:38,783 --> 00:42:41,327
I thought we were going
to a costume party.

691
00:42:41,577 --> 00:42:44,455
It's like I said, I love this film.

692
00:42:44,706 --> 00:42:46,916
I've seen it over 100 times.

693
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:48,167
Phil!

694
00:42:48,418 --> 00:42:49,669
Told you

695
00:42:49,919 --> 00:42:52,171
call me "Bronco."

696
00:42:52,422 --> 00:42:54,215
Sorry, Bronco.

697
00:42:55,466 --> 00:42:57,135
Hi, Nancy.

698
00:43:01,347 --> 00:43:03,307
My own fiancée

699
00:43:03,558 --> 00:43:05,685
doesn't remember me.

700
00:43:06,812 --> 00:43:08,812
- Hi.
- Hi.

701
00:43:08,813 --> 00:43:11,357
That'll be one adult and

702
00:43:11,607 --> 00:43:14,861
- Two adults.
- Two adults, I guess.

703
00:43:17,355 --> 00:43:22,485
<i>- groundhog who, as legend has it,
can predict the coming of an early spring.</i>

704
00:43:22,994 --> 00:43:25,747
<i>So, I guess the question we have
to ask ourselves today is:</i>

705
00:43:25,997 --> 00:43:27,957
<i>"Does Phil feel lucky?"</i>

706
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:30,960
Rita, if you only had
one day to live

707
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:32,837
what would you do with it?

708
00:43:33,087 --> 00:43:35,631
I don't know, Phil.
What are you dying of?

709
00:43:35,882 --> 00:43:40,344
No. I mean the whole world
is about to explode.

710
00:43:40,553 --> 00:43:41,554
What do you do?

711
00:43:41,804 --> 00:43:44,098
I just want to know where
to put the camera.

712
00:43:44,307 --> 00:43:46,809
What are you looking for, Phil?
A date for the weekend?

713
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,896
No, I'm just interested in you.

714
00:43:50,146 --> 00:43:52,398
You know, what do you want?
What do you like?

715
00:43:52,607 --> 00:43:54,484
What do you think about?

716
00:43:54,734 --> 00:43:57,028
What kind of men are
you interested in?

717
00:43:57,236 --> 00:43:59,071
What do you do for fun?

718
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:02,992
Is this for real, Phil, or are you just
trying to make me look like a fool?

719
00:44:03,201 --> 00:44:07,413
I'm just trying to talk like normal
people talk. Isn't this how they talk?

720
00:44:07,622 --> 00:44:09,957
- Close.
- Okay, so talk to me.

721
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:12,418
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

722
00:44:14,712 --> 00:44:15,588
And a doughnut.

723
00:44:15,797 --> 00:44:17,423
All right.

724
00:44:19,801 --> 00:44:21,803
<i>So what do you want out of life, anyway?</i>

725
00:44:23,721 --> 00:44:25,973
I guess I want what everybody wants.
You know.

726
00:44:26,182 --> 00:44:29,727
Career, love, marriage, children.

727
00:44:30,144 --> 00:44:31,604
Are you seeing anyone?

728
00:44:32,104 --> 00:44:36,776
I think this is getting too personal. I don't
think I'm ready to share this with you.

729
00:44:37,944 --> 00:44:40,196
How about you?
What do you want?

730
00:44:41,364 --> 00:44:44,659
What I really want is
someone like you.

731
00:44:44,909 --> 00:44:46,202
Oh, please!

732
00:44:46,452 --> 00:44:48,621
Well, why not?
What are you looking for?

733
00:44:48,871 --> 00:44:50,206
Who's your perfect guy?

734
00:44:51,582 --> 00:44:55,586
Well, first of all, he's too humble
to know he's perfect.

735
00:44:56,921 --> 00:44:58,297
That's me!

736
00:44:58,548 --> 00:45:01,884
He's intelligent, supportive, funny.

737
00:45:02,134 --> 00:45:04,345
Intelligent, supportive, funny.

738
00:45:04,595 --> 00:45:07,932
Me, me, me.

739
00:45:08,182 --> 00:45:10,977
He's romantic and courageous.

740
00:45:11,227 --> 00:45:12,478
Me, also.

741
00:45:13,062 --> 00:45:16,649
He's got a good body but he doesn't have
to look in the mirror every two minutes.

742
00:45:17,316 --> 00:45:22,154
I have a great body, and sometimes
I go months without looking.

743
00:45:24,657 --> 00:45:28,160
He's kind, sensitive, gentle.

744
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,538
He's not afraid to cry in front of me.

745
00:45:30,788 --> 00:45:33,374
This is a man we're talking
about, right?

746
00:45:33,624 --> 00:45:38,587
He likes animals, children, and
he'll change poopy diapers.

747
00:45:38,838 --> 00:45:41,215
Does he have to use the word 'poopy'?

748
00:45:42,758 --> 00:45:46,220
And he plays an instrument,
and he loves his mother.

749
00:45:47,471 --> 00:45:50,224
I am really close on this one.

750
00:45:51,017 --> 00:45:53,769
Really, really close.

751
00:45:58,232 --> 00:45:59,817
It's Phil Connors!

752
00:46:00,026 --> 00:46:01,319
Hello.

753
00:46:01,527 --> 00:46:03,362
Thanks for watching.

754
00:46:16,292 --> 00:46:19,462
So. What are the chances
of getting out today?

755
00:46:19,712 --> 00:46:21,964
Van still won't start.
Larry's working on it.

756
00:46:22,214 --> 00:46:23,632
Wouldn't you know it?

757
00:46:23,883 --> 00:46:25,676
Can I buy you a drink?

758
00:46:27,003 --> 00:46:28,003
Okay.

759
00:46:28,304 --> 00:46:30,973
Jim Beam, ice, water.

760
00:46:31,807 --> 00:46:32,933
For you, miss?

761
00:46:33,392 --> 00:46:36,729
Sweet vermouth on the rocks
with a twist, please.

762
00:46:42,026 --> 00:46:44,278
What are the chances
of getting out of town today?

763
00:46:44,528 --> 00:46:46,947
The van still won't start.
Larry's working on it.

764
00:46:47,198 --> 00:46:48,824
Oh, wouldn't you know it?

765
00:46:49,033 --> 00:46:50,910
Can I buy you a drink?

766
00:46:52,211 --> 00:46:53,211
Okay.

767
00:46:53,788 --> 00:46:56,499
Sweet vermouth, rocks,
with a twist, please.

768
00:46:56,707 --> 00:46:57,583
For you, miss?

769
00:46:57,958 --> 00:46:59,460
The same.

770
00:47:00,294 --> 00:47:01,962
That's my favorite drink.

771
00:47:02,213 --> 00:47:03,964
Mine too!

772
00:47:04,215 --> 00:47:05,758
It always makes me think of Rome.

773
00:47:06,008 --> 00:47:09,261
The way the sun hits
the buildings in the afternoon.

774
00:47:11,013 --> 00:47:13,015
Well, what should we drink to?

775
00:47:14,266 --> 00:47:16,185
To the groundhog!

776
00:47:16,435 --> 00:47:19,063
I always drink to world peace.

777
00:47:27,988 --> 00:47:29,907
Can I buy you a drink?

778
00:47:30,908 --> 00:47:31,908
Okay.

779
00:47:32,827 --> 00:47:35,871
Sweet vermouth, rocks,
with a twist, please.

780
00:47:36,539 --> 00:47:38,249
For you, miss?

781
00:47:38,499 --> 00:47:40,167
The same.

782
00:47:40,793 --> 00:47:42,253
That's my favorite drink.

783
00:47:42,503 --> 00:47:44,088
Mine too!

784
00:47:45,297 --> 00:47:47,550
It always makes me think of Rome.

785
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,595
The way the sun hits
the buildings in the afternoon.

786
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,515
Well, what should we drink to?

787
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:59,728
I'd like to say a prayer and
drink to world peace.

788
00:48:01,689 --> 00:48:04,782
- To world peace.
- World peace.

789
00:48:13,534 --> 00:48:16,870
- This is wonderful!
- See? Didn't I tell you?

790
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:19,123
How do you know so much
about Punxsutawney?

791
00:48:19,331 --> 00:48:21,750
I spent a lot of time here.

792
00:48:22,001 --> 00:48:24,044
Small-town people are more real.
They're down-to-earth.

793
00:48:24,295 --> 00:48:26,672
- That's how I feel!
- Really?

794
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,009
- Would you like to try some white chocolate?
- Yuck, don't make me sick.

795
00:48:30,259 --> 00:48:31,427
No white chocolate.

796
00:48:31,635 --> 00:48:34,555
There is something so
familiar about this.

797
00:48:34,805 --> 00:48:36,890
Do you ever have déjà vu?

798
00:48:37,141 --> 00:48:39,351
Didn't you just ask me that?

799
00:48:43,314 --> 00:48:46,900
I think people place too much
emphasis on their careers.

800
00:48:47,109 --> 00:48:50,279
I wish we could all live in the mountains.
At high altitude.

801
00:48:50,487 --> 00:48:53,032
That's where I see myself
in five years.

802
00:48:53,282 --> 00:48:54,199
How about you?

803
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:57,286
Oh, I agree. I just like
to go with the flow.

804
00:48:57,494 --> 00:48:59,580
See where it leads me.

805
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:01,665
Well, it's led you here.

806
00:49:03,417 --> 00:49:07,087
Which is about a million miles from
where I started out in college.

807
00:49:07,338 --> 00:49:10,841
You weren't in broadcasting
or journalism?

808
00:49:11,925 --> 00:49:16,055
Believe it or not, I studied
19th-century French poetry.

809
00:49:16,347 --> 00:49:17,931
What a waste of time!

810
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:21,101
I mean, for someone else that would
be an incredible waste of time.

811
00:49:21,352 --> 00:49:23,395
It was so bold of you to choose that.

812
00:49:23,645 --> 00:49:27,316
It's incredible.
You must be a very, very strong person.

813
00:49:29,068 --> 00:49:32,571
I think people place too much
emphasis on their careers.

814
00:49:32,821 --> 00:49:37,368
Gosh! I wish we could all live in the
mountains. At high altitudes.

815
00:49:37,618 --> 00:49:39,870
That's where I see myself
in five years.

816
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,080
How about you?

817
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:45,250
Oh, I agree. I just like to go
with the flow, see what happens.

818
00:49:45,501 --> 00:49:47,795
Well, it's gotten you here.

819
00:49:48,337 --> 00:49:51,548
Of course, it's a million miles
from where I started out in college.

820
00:49:51,799 --> 00:49:55,260
Oh, yeah? You weren't in broadcasting
or journalism or anything like that?

821
00:49:56,386 --> 00:50:00,474
Believe it or not, I studied
19th-century French poetry.

822
00:50:04,975 --> 00:50:06,975
<i>The girl I will love</i>

823
00:50:06,976 --> 00:50:08,976
<i>is like a fine wine</i>

824
00:50:09,677 --> 00:50:11,677
<i>that gets a little better</i>

825
00:50:12,178 --> 00:50:15,578
<i>every morning.</i>

826
00:50:17,407 --> 00:50:18,700
You speak French!

827
00:50:19,201 --> 00:50:20,201
Oui!

828
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:27,209
- I haven't done this since I was a kid.
- Me, neither.

829
00:50:27,459 --> 00:50:29,253
It's fun!

830
00:50:29,711 --> 00:50:30,587
It's good, clean fun.

831
00:50:33,465 --> 00:50:36,969
I hope that one day I can do this
with my own children.

832
00:50:40,389 --> 00:50:42,641
Where did you get that?

833
00:50:42,891 --> 00:50:45,519
Well, I went over
to the snowman shop.

834
00:50:47,354 --> 00:50:48,897
Hey, an assassin!

835
00:50:49,356 --> 00:50:50,941
I'll protect you, Your Majesty!

836
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:54,194
I shall die for you.
You shall not take her!

837
00:50:54,403 --> 00:50:55,696
Find cover, my Lady!

838
00:50:58,031 --> 00:51:00,367
I'm getting some good ones.
Ooh, hey, there's a boy.

839
00:51:00,576 --> 00:51:03,453
That's a boy! Good try.

840
00:51:03,662 --> 00:51:05,330
Help me!

841
00:51:09,031 --> 00:51:12,531
#  You give your hand to me  #

842
00:51:12,532 --> 00:51:16,032
#  And then you say, "Hello"  #

843
00:51:16,033 --> 00:51:19,233
#  And I can hardly speak  #

844
00:51:19,234 --> 00:51:22,234
#  My heart is beating so  #

845
00:51:22,235 --> 00:51:25,935
#  And anyone can tell  #

846
00:51:25,936 --> 00:51:29,436
#  You think you know me well  #

847
00:51:29,437 --> 00:51:32,937
#  Well, you don't know me  #

848
00:51:32,938 --> 00:51:36,438
#  No you don't know me  #

849
00:51:36,439 --> 00:51:39,739
#  No you don't know the one  #

850
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:42,940
#  Who dreams of you at night  #

851
00:51:42,941 --> 00:51:46,241
#  And longs to kiss your lips  #

852
00:51:46,242 --> 00:51:49,542
#  And longs to hold you tight  #

853
00:51:49,543 --> 00:51:53,043
#  Oh, I'm just a friend  #

854
00:51:53,044 --> 00:51:56,344
#  That's all I've ever been  #

855
00:51:56,945 --> 00:52:00,445
#  'Cause you don't know me  #

856
00:52:01,303 --> 00:52:02,471
What?

857
00:52:02,721 --> 00:52:06,767
I'm just amazed,
and I'm not easily amazed.

858
00:52:07,017 --> 00:52:08,435
About what?

859
00:52:08,685 --> 00:52:11,438
How you can start a day with one
kind of expectation

860
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:13,732
and end up so
completely different.

861
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:18,320
Well, do you like the way
this day is turning out?

862
00:52:18,528 --> 00:52:20,947
I like it very much.

863
00:52:21,198 --> 00:52:24,701
It's a perfect day.
You couldn't plan a day like this.

864
00:52:24,951 --> 00:52:26,203
Well, you can.

865
00:52:26,411 --> 00:52:29,414
It just takes an awful lot of work.

866
00:52:29,664 --> 00:52:31,875
Come on in.
I want to show you something.

867
00:52:32,084 --> 00:52:34,378
- I don't think I should, Phil.
- Oh, I don't think you should, either.

868
00:52:34,628 --> 00:52:38,965
That's why I'm just going to show you this
one thing, and kick you right out.
So, it'll be one minute.

869
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,393
It's just lovely.

870
00:52:59,778 --> 00:53:02,531
Would you like to sit
and stare at the fake fire?

871
00:53:02,732 --> 00:53:03,732
Okay.

872
00:53:07,202 --> 00:53:09,412
It's a really wonderful room.

873
00:53:09,663 --> 00:53:11,498
It is now.

874
00:53:18,421 --> 00:53:20,882
I don't know, Phil.
I don't think we should do this.

875
00:53:21,133 --> 00:53:22,759
I don't either.

876
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:28,181
You know what?
On second thought, I think we should.

877
00:53:29,015 --> 00:53:32,185
It's the perfect end
to a perfect day.

878
00:53:32,769 --> 00:53:35,689
Well, it's a little fast for me.

879
00:53:35,939 --> 00:53:37,357
Me, too.

880
00:53:37,816 --> 00:53:40,068
Maybe I should go.

881
00:53:40,277 --> 00:53:42,195
Where would you go?

882
00:53:42,445 --> 00:53:43,822
Why?

883
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:46,324
We've got a perfect fire.

884
00:53:46,616 --> 00:53:49,661
I've got some French poetry here.
Baudelaire

885
00:53:49,662 --> 00:53:50,662
Sé fantastique.

886
00:53:51,204 --> 00:53:52,706
I will read to you.

887
00:53:53,456 --> 00:53:57,586
I've got some ice cream over on the
windowsill. Hold on a minute.

888
00:54:03,216 --> 00:54:04,259
Rocky road.

889
00:54:04,509 --> 00:54:06,052
Oh! I love rocky road.

890
00:54:06,303 --> 00:54:08,221
Yeah, I thought so.

891
00:54:08,513 --> 00:54:10,223
You have to stay.

892
00:54:10,473 --> 00:54:14,269
No, really, Phil, I'm tired.
We can see each other tomorrow.

893
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:18,273
No, tonight.
It's got to be tonight.

894
00:54:18,481 --> 00:54:21,359
No, Phil, really.

895
00:54:22,277 --> 00:54:25,530
Come on. Just stay for a while and
if you like it, stay for a while longer.

896
00:54:25,739 --> 00:54:27,866
And if you like that, stay longer.

897
00:54:28,074 --> 00:54:29,951
Let's not spoil it, okay?

898
00:54:30,201 --> 00:54:32,621
I'm not spoiling.
I don't want to spoil it either.

899
00:54:32,829 --> 00:54:35,749
You know I can't--
I can't stay with you.

900
00:54:35,999 --> 00:54:39,085
Why not? I love you.

901
00:54:41,129 --> 00:54:43,256
- You love me?
- I love you.

902
00:54:43,506 --> 00:54:47,636
- You don't even know me.
- Oh, I know you.

903
00:54:49,179 --> 00:54:52,140
Oh, no. I can't believe
I fell for this!

904
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:54,768
This whole day has been
one long setup.

905
00:54:55,018 --> 00:54:55,977
No, it hasn't.

906
00:54:56,227 --> 00:54:58,980
And I hate fudge. Yuck!

907
00:54:59,272 --> 00:55:01,316
No white chocolate, no fudge.

908
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:05,320
What are you doing? Are you making
some kind of list, or something?

909
00:55:05,528 --> 00:55:08,740
Did you call up my friends and ask them
what I like and what I don't like?

910
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:12,494
- Is this what love is for you?
- No. This is real. This is love.

911
00:55:12,702 --> 00:55:14,162
Stop saying that!

912
00:55:14,788 --> 00:55:16,331
You must be crazy.

913
00:55:16,581 --> 00:55:20,293
I could never love someone like you, Phil,
because you'll never love anyone but yourself.

914
00:55:20,835 --> 00:55:24,422
That's not true. I don't even like myself.
Give me another chance.

915
00:55:26,091 --> 00:55:28,718
That's for making me
care about you.

916
00:55:35,684 --> 00:55:38,144
- I haven't done this since I was a kid.
- Me neither.

917
00:55:38,395 --> 00:55:39,396
It's fun!

918
00:55:39,604 --> 00:55:43,942
And good, clean fun too. I think that's what's
missing in the world today, don't you?

919
00:55:44,192 --> 00:55:46,903
Gosh, I can't wait to do this
with my own children.

920
00:55:47,112 --> 00:55:48,655
Golly! I want kids!
Lots of kids!

921
00:55:48,905 --> 00:55:52,742
I want to adopt, I want to have my own
kids, I want to have foster kids.

922
00:55:52,992 --> 00:55:55,245
I got this over at Snowman City.
Look what you can round up.

923
00:55:55,495 --> 00:55:58,331
Hey! Some kid just
threw a snowball at us.

924
00:55:58,581 --> 00:56:01,418
Come here! Let's have some fun!

925
00:56:03,628 --> 00:56:06,423
I wish these were my own
kids hitting me like this.

926
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:11,678
Are any of you up for adoption?

927
00:56:12,387 --> 00:56:14,806
Hey, here's a humdinger over here!

928
00:56:15,056 --> 00:56:17,100
Wasn't that great?

929
00:56:25,525 --> 00:56:27,152
Stop it!

930
00:57:11,946 --> 00:57:13,948
Phil! Over here!

931
00:57:16,326 --> 00:57:18,953
Where have you been?
You're missing all the fun.

932
00:57:19,204 --> 00:57:21,080
Phil, you look terrible.

933
00:57:21,748 --> 00:57:24,250
What happened? Rough night?

934
00:57:25,451 --> 00:57:26,451
Yeah.

935
00:57:42,477 --> 00:57:44,145
Okay, campers.

936
00:57:44,562 --> 00:57:46,397
Rise and shine.

937
00:57:48,316 --> 00:57:51,986
And don't forget your booties,
because it's cold out there today.

938
00:57:52,904 --> 00:57:55,323
It's cold out there every day.

939
00:57:56,032 --> 00:58:00,969
<i>This country's largest lake, Chapala,
is located near the city of Guadalajara.</i>

940
00:58:01,037 --> 00:58:02,121
What is Mexico?

941
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:03,373
<i>What is Mexico?</i>

942
00:58:03,706 --> 00:58:05,541
<i>- Correct.
- Lakes and Rivers, 400.</i>

943
00:58:05,792 --> 00:58:09,061
<i>Seneca is the largest of these lakes
in West-Central New York.</i>

944
00:58:09,128 --> 00:58:10,630
What are the Finger Lakes?

945
00:58:10,838 --> 00:58:13,800
<i>- What are the Finger Lakes?
- Correct.</i>

946
00:58:14,008 --> 00:58:18,179
<i>- This South American lake in Bolivia...
- What is Titicaca?</i>

947
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:20,181
<i>- What is Titicaca?
- Correct.</i>

948
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:21,349
Lakes and Rivers for 1,000.

949
00:58:21,557 --> 00:58:23,476
<i>- Milky-colored...
- The Rhone.</i>

950
00:58:23,726 --> 00:58:25,353
<i>when entering Lake Geneva</i>

951
00:58:25,603 --> 00:58:28,147
<i>this river is
clear blue upon exiting.</i>

952
00:58:28,356 --> 00:58:29,315
<i>- Jim?
- What is the Rhone?</i>

953
00:58:29,565 --> 00:58:30,900
<i>Good for $1, 000.</i>

954
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:34,569
<i>- You're $500 off the lead right now.
- Let's go to inventors for $200.</i>

955
00:58:36,364 --> 00:58:38,032
This is pitiful.

956
00:58:38,366 --> 00:58:39,784
A thousand people

957
00:58:40,034 --> 00:58:43,037
freezing their butts off,
waiting to worship a rat.

958
00:58:43,246 --> 00:58:44,431
What a hype.

959
00:58:44,432 --> 00:58:46,932
Groundhog Day used to mean
something in this town.

960
00:58:46,933 --> 00:58:49,733
They used to pull the hog out,
and they used to eat it.

961
00:58:49,752 --> 00:58:52,880
You're hypocrites! All of you!

962
00:58:55,174 --> 00:58:57,718
You got a problem with what
I'm saying, Larry?

963
00:58:58,177 --> 00:59:01,011
Untie your tongue and you come
out here and talk, huh?

964
00:59:01,012 --> 00:59:03,012
Am I upsetting you, princess?

965
00:59:03,224 --> 00:59:05,017
You know, you want a prediction
about the weather?

966
00:59:05,268 --> 00:59:07,937
You're asking the wrong Phil.

967
00:59:08,187 --> 00:59:10,857
I'll give you a winter prediction.

968
00:59:11,107 --> 00:59:13,151
It's going to be cold.

969
00:59:13,401 --> 00:59:15,611
It's going to be gray.

970
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:20,616
And it's going to last you
for the rest of your life.

971
00:59:21,098 --> 00:59:24,598
#  And put your little hand in mine  #

972
00:59:26,798 --> 00:59:30,298
#  And put your little hand in mine  #

973
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:33,299
#  There ain't no hill or mount--  #

974
00:59:39,098 --> 00:59:42,598
#  And put your little hand in mine  #

975
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:48,599
#  There ain't no hill or mountain
we can't climb  #

976
00:59:49,141 --> 00:59:50,141
#  Babe  #

977
00:59:52,142 --> 00:59:54,642
#  I got you, Babe  #

978
00:59:55,443 --> 00:59:59,197
Once again the eyes of the nation
have turned here to this

979
00:59:59,697 --> 01:00:02,950
tiny village in Western Pennsylvania.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

980
01:00:03,159 --> 01:00:06,078
There is no way that this winter

981
01:00:06,329 --> 01:00:09,207
is ever going to end

982
01:00:09,415 --> 01:00:13,377
as long as this groundhog keeps
seeing his shadow.

983
01:00:13,628 --> 01:00:15,504
I don't see any other way out.

984
01:00:16,297 --> 01:00:18,174
He's got to be stopped.

985
01:00:19,675 --> 01:00:21,052
And I have to stop it.

986
01:00:23,396 --> 01:00:24,230
Real good, Phil.

987
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,732
Real good.

988
01:00:27,316 --> 01:00:29,601
He's out of his gourd.

989
01:00:33,573 --> 01:00:36,951
I'm worried. I think there's something
really wrong with Phil.

990
01:00:37,201 --> 01:00:39,871
Yeah, there's a lot of things
really wrong with Phil.

991
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,491
Oh, hi, Phil.

992
01:00:43,908 --> 01:00:46,035
I've come to the end of me, Rita.

993
01:00:46,285 --> 01:00:48,412
There's no way out now.

994
01:00:49,872 --> 01:00:53,209
I just want you to remember, we had
a beautiful day together once.

995
01:00:56,629 --> 01:00:58,047
All right, little fellow.

996
01:00:58,297 --> 01:01:01,676
Good job. He just smiled at me!
Did you see that?

997
01:01:01,926 --> 01:01:03,427
I believe he did.

998
01:01:04,345 --> 01:01:07,181
Okay, little fellow.
There you go.

999
01:01:09,183 --> 01:01:11,560
Hi, there, mister.
Something I can do you for?

1000
01:01:13,145 --> 01:01:14,145
Hey!

1001
01:01:14,146 --> 01:01:16,065
Hey! What are you doing?

1002
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,863
Dave! Get the word out.
Somebody kidnapped Phil!

1003
01:01:23,239 --> 01:01:24,573
We're going after him!

1004
01:01:31,247 --> 01:01:33,666
Why would anybody steal a groundhog?

1005
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:35,960
I could probably think of
a couple of reasons.

1006
01:01:36,168 --> 01:01:37,128
Pervert.

1007
01:02:03,154 --> 01:02:04,947
He must have just snapped!

1008
01:02:05,156 --> 01:02:06,490
This ought to be good.

1009
01:02:08,868 --> 01:02:10,119
What is he doing?

1010
01:02:10,327 --> 01:02:11,871
What can he be thinking?

1011
01:02:12,538 --> 01:02:14,323
That's not bad for a quadruped.

1012
01:02:14,373 --> 01:02:18,294
You got to check your mirrors.
Use the side of your eye. Side of your eye.

1013
01:02:24,341 --> 01:02:25,843
That's it. That's it.

1014
01:02:26,093 --> 01:02:29,138
Hey, they're chasing us!
Come on, make it fun.

1015
01:02:37,354 --> 01:02:38,522
Don't drive angry.

1016
01:02:38,731 --> 01:02:39,940
Don't drive angry.

1017
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,838
Hot dog! There's no way out except
the way we came in!

1018
01:03:02,888 --> 01:03:04,548
We got him now!

1019
01:03:23,859 --> 01:03:25,069
What the hell is he doing?

1020
01:03:25,319 --> 01:03:26,320
I don't know.

1021
01:03:30,658 --> 01:03:33,452
If you got to shoot, aim high,
I don't want to hit the groundhog.

1022
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:40,000
Well, we mustn't keep our
public waiting, huh?

1023
01:03:43,337 --> 01:03:45,372
It's show time, Phil.

1024
01:03:51,053 --> 01:03:52,346
All right.
On me, Larry,  in three,

1025
01:03:54,473 --> 01:03:55,307
two

1026
01:03:57,226 --> 01:03:58,185
one.

1027
01:04:11,991 --> 01:04:13,033
Phil!

1028
01:04:15,369 --> 01:04:16,745
He might be okay.

1029
01:04:21,375 --> 01:04:23,919
Well, no. Probably not now.

1030
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:36,059
#  And put your little hand in mine  #

1031
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:39,560
#  There ain't no hill or mountain
we can't climb  #

1032
01:04:39,561 --> 01:04:42,061
Aww, nuts.

1033
01:04:48,736 --> 01:04:51,655
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

1034
01:04:52,698 --> 01:04:54,366
Would you like some

1035
01:04:54,992 --> 01:04:56,410
toast?

1036
01:05:14,762 --> 01:05:16,847
Oh, my God!

1037
01:05:49,221 --> 01:05:50,897
That's him.

1038
01:05:53,967 --> 01:05:57,387
He was a really, really great guy.

1039
01:05:57,638 --> 01:05:59,348
I really, really liked him

1040
01:05:59,549 --> 01:06:01,049
a lot.

1041
01:06:07,848 --> 01:06:09,850
I'm sorry?
What was that again?

1042
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:13,320
- I'm a god.
- You're God?

1043
01:06:13,529 --> 01:06:16,782
I'm a god. I'm not the god,
I don't think.

1044
01:06:17,366 --> 01:06:19,493
Because you survived a car wreck?

1045
01:06:19,701 --> 01:06:20,869
You folks ready to order?

1046
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:24,331
I didn't just survive a wreck.
I wasn't just blown up yesterday.

1047
01:06:24,748 --> 01:06:27,334
I have been stabbed,
shot, poisoned

1048
01:06:27,543 --> 01:06:30,879
frozen, hung, electrocuted
and burned.

1049
01:06:31,088 --> 01:06:32,422
Oh, really?

1050
01:06:32,673 --> 01:06:36,885
And every morning I wake up without a
scratch on me, not a dent in the fender.

1051
01:06:37,594 --> 01:06:38,679
I am an immortal.

1052
01:06:38,887 --> 01:06:41,515
Special today is blueberry waffles.

1053
01:06:41,723 --> 01:06:43,558
Why are you telling me this?

1054
01:06:43,850 --> 01:06:45,978
Because I want you to believe in me.

1055
01:06:46,186 --> 01:06:47,521
You're not a god.

1056
01:06:47,729 --> 01:06:51,149
You can take my word for it. This is
12 years of Catholic school talking.

1057
01:06:51,692 --> 01:06:53,652
I could come back if you're not ready.

1058
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:55,862
How do you know I'm not a god?

1059
01:06:56,071 --> 01:06:57,322
Oh, please.

1060
01:06:57,572 --> 01:07:00,108
- How do you know?
- Because it's not possible.

1061
01:07:00,117 --> 01:07:01,868
I'll come back.

1062
01:07:02,202 --> 01:07:03,453
Doris.

1063
01:07:06,873 --> 01:07:09,459
This is Doris. Her brother-in-law, Carl,
owns this diner.

1064
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:11,280
She's worked here since
she was 17.

1065
01:07:11,281 --> 01:07:14,981
More than anything else  in her life,
she wants to see Paris before she dies.

1066
01:07:15,007 --> 01:07:15,966
Oh, boy! Would I.

1067
01:07:16,174 --> 01:07:18,844
- What are you doing?
- This is Debbie Kleiser and her fiancé, Fred.

1068
01:07:19,094 --> 01:07:20,345
Do I know you?

1069
01:07:20,554 --> 01:07:23,432
They're supposed to getting married this
afternoon, but Debbie is having second thoughts.

1070
01:07:23,682 --> 01:07:24,850
What?

1071
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:26,226
Lovely ring.

1072
01:07:26,476 --> 01:07:31,314
This is Bill. He's been a waiter here for three years,
since he left Penn State and had to get work.

1073
01:07:31,565 --> 01:07:34,651
He likes the town,
he paints toy soldiers, and he's gay.

1074
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:35,902
I am.

1075
01:07:36,528 --> 01:07:39,281
This is Gus. He hates his life here,
he wishes he'd stayed in the Navy.

1076
01:07:39,531 --> 01:07:42,075
Well, I could've retired
on half pay after 20 years.

1077
01:07:42,325 --> 01:07:44,161
Excuse me.
Is this some kind of trick?

1078
01:07:44,411 --> 01:07:48,248
Well, maybe the real God uses tricks.
You know, maybe he's not omnipotent

1079
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:50,417
he's just been around so long
he just knows everything.

1080
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:52,002
- Well, who's that?
- This is Tom.

1081
01:07:52,252 --> 01:07:54,254
He worked in the coal mine
till they closed it down.

1082
01:07:54,463 --> 01:07:55,630
- And her?
- That's Alice.

1083
01:07:55,881 --> 01:07:58,425
She came over here from Ireland when she was
a baby. She lived in Erie most of her life.

1084
01:07:58,675 --> 01:07:59,509
He's right.

1085
01:07:59,718 --> 01:08:01,136
- And her?
- Nancy.

1086
01:08:01,386 --> 01:08:05,348
She works in a dress shop, and makes noises
like a chipmunk when she gets real excited.

1087
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,309
- It's true.
- How do you know these people?

1088
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:09,269
I told you, I know everything.

1089
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:12,397
In about five seconds, a waiter
is going to drop a tray of dishes.

1090
01:08:12,606 --> 01:08:15,358
- Five, four, three, two, one.
- This is nuts.

1091
01:08:17,694 --> 01:08:20,113
- Okay?
- Okay, that's enough.

1092
01:08:21,156 --> 01:08:23,366
What about me, Phil?
Do you know me, too?

1093
01:08:23,617 --> 01:08:27,829
I know all about you. You like producing, but
you hope for more than Channel 9 Pittsburgh.

1094
01:08:28,038 --> 01:08:30,457
Well, everyone knows that.

1095
01:08:30,832 --> 01:08:33,418
You like boats but not the ocean.

1096
01:08:33,835 --> 01:08:37,214
You go to a lake in the summer with
your family up in the mountains.

1097
01:08:37,464 --> 01:08:41,384
There's a long wooden dock and a boathouse
with boards missing from the roof

1098
01:08:42,093 --> 01:08:45,013
and a place you used to crawl
underneath to be alone.

1099
01:08:45,639 --> 01:08:48,892
You're a sucker for French
poetry and rhinestones.

1100
01:08:49,601 --> 01:08:51,019
You're very generous.

1101
01:08:51,269 --> 01:08:53,772
You're kind to strangers
and children.

1102
01:08:54,314 --> 01:08:57,150
And when you stand in the snow
you look like an angel.

1103
01:08:57,609 --> 01:08:59,152
How are you doing this?

1104
01:09:00,237 --> 01:09:03,198
I told you. I wake up every day.

1105
01:09:03,448 --> 01:09:05,116
Right here.

1106
01:09:05,325 --> 01:09:08,745
Right in Punxsutawney.
And it's always February 2nd.

1107
01:09:09,746 --> 01:09:12,249
And there's nothing
I can do about it.

1108
01:09:12,958 --> 01:09:16,044
If you still can't believe me, listen:

1109
01:09:16,294 --> 01:09:18,296
In 10 seconds

1110
01:09:18,797 --> 01:09:22,259
Larry is going to come through that door
and take you away from me.

1111
01:09:22,508 --> 01:09:24,343
But you can't let him.

1112
01:09:24,344 --> 01:09:25,344
Larry?

1113
01:09:25,345 --> 01:09:28,390
Please believe me.
You've got to believe me.

1114
01:09:33,478 --> 01:09:37,482
You guys ready? We better get going if
we're going to stay ahead of the weather.

1115
01:09:38,108 --> 01:09:39,359
What's that?

1116
01:09:40,277 --> 01:09:42,696
"if we're going to stay ahead
of the weather."

1117
01:09:48,201 --> 01:09:52,289
Maybe it really is happening.
I mean, how else could you know so much?

1118
01:09:52,497 --> 01:09:55,000
Well, there is no way.
I'm not that smart.

1119
01:09:56,126 --> 01:09:58,378
Maybe I should spend the rest
of the day with you

1120
01:09:58,628 --> 01:10:02,090
as an objective witness,
just to see what happens.

1121
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:04,801
Gee, this sounds like a
science project.

1122
01:10:05,927 --> 01:10:07,137
Concentrate.

1123
01:10:07,387 --> 01:10:09,180
You got to want it.

1124
01:10:09,639 --> 01:10:11,725
You've got to want it, Rita.

1125
01:10:12,183 --> 01:10:17,062
Oh, come on. It's more in the wrist
than the fingers. You just gotta--

1126
01:10:24,362 --> 01:10:26,197
Be the hat. Come on, go.
Be the hat.

1127
01:10:26,448 --> 01:10:29,409
- It would take me a year to get good at this.
- No. Six months.

1128
01:10:29,659 --> 01:10:32,912
Four to five hours a day,
and you'd be an expert.

1129
01:10:33,413 --> 01:10:37,042
- Is this what you do with eternity?
- Now you know.

1130
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:40,503
That's not the worst part.

1131
01:10:40,754 --> 01:10:42,172
What's the worst part?

1132
01:10:42,422 --> 01:10:44,424
The worst part is that

1133
01:10:44,632 --> 01:10:47,177
tomorrow you'll have forgotten
all about this

1134
01:10:47,427 --> 01:10:50,637
- and you'll treat me like a jerk again.
- No.

1135
01:10:50,764 --> 01:10:52,223
It's all right. I am a jerk.

1136
01:10:52,432 --> 01:10:54,267
No, you're not.

1137
01:10:54,642 --> 01:10:59,147
It doesn't make any difference.
I've killed myself so many times

1138
01:10:59,397 --> 01:11:01,107
I don't even exist anymore.

1139
01:11:01,691 --> 01:11:04,444
Well sometimes I wish I had
a thousand lifetimes.

1140
01:11:05,028 --> 01:11:08,031
I don't know, Phil.
Maybe it's not a curse.

1141
01:11:08,281 --> 01:11:10,909
It just depends on how
you look at it.

1142
01:11:12,452 --> 01:11:14,662
Gosh, you're an upbeat lady!

1143
01:11:17,957 --> 01:11:21,127
I want you to know it's been
a really nice day for me.

1144
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:22,253
Me, too.

1145
01:11:22,462 --> 01:11:23,671
And maybe

1146
01:11:23,922 --> 01:11:27,592
if it's not too boring,
we can do it again sometime.

1147
01:11:27,842 --> 01:11:29,260
I hope so.

1148
01:11:41,439 --> 01:11:43,233
You're still here?

1149
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:48,446
I thought you were supposed to disappear.
Or I was, or something.

1150
01:11:48,696 --> 01:11:50,365
Not until 6.

1151
01:11:51,241 --> 01:11:52,659
You rat!

1152
01:11:52,909 --> 01:11:54,744
I never said midnight.

1153
01:11:55,078 --> 01:11:57,539
You knew I was waiting for midnight.

1154
01:11:58,331 --> 01:11:59,749
Does this mean you are going to leave?

1155
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:02,550
No.

1156
01:12:03,545 --> 01:12:04,671
Good.

1157
01:12:06,672 --> 01:12:07,672
Okay.

1158
01:12:15,348 --> 01:12:17,016
I'm sorry.

1159
01:12:18,518 --> 01:12:20,770
It's all right.
You can fall asleep.

1160
01:12:21,771 --> 01:12:24,107
I promise I won't touch you.

1161
01:12:24,816 --> 01:12:26,067
Much.

1162
01:12:27,402 --> 01:12:30,154
It's all right. I'm not tired.

1163
01:12:30,989 --> 01:12:32,657
What were you saying?

1164
01:12:34,075 --> 01:12:37,370
I think the last thing that
you heard was

1165
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:40,290
only God could make a tree.

1166
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:41,624
Really?

1167
01:13:19,787 --> 01:13:22,081
What I wanted to say was

1168
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:25,960
I think you are the kindest

1169
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:28,755
sweetest, prettiest person

1170
01:13:29,255 --> 01:13:31,257
that I've ever met in my life.

1171
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,011
I've never seen anyone

1172
01:13:35,636 --> 01:13:38,139
that's nicer to people
than you are.

1173
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:53,154
And the first time I saw you

1174
01:13:54,238 --> 01:13:56,491
something happened to me.

1175
01:13:57,742 --> 01:13:59,869
I never told you, but

1176
01:14:03,247 --> 01:14:05,666
I knew that I wanted to hold you

1177
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:07,752
as hard as I could.

1178
01:14:20,723 --> 01:14:23,184
I don't deserve someone like you.

1179
01:14:27,021 --> 01:14:28,815
But if I ever could

1180
01:14:30,274 --> 01:14:32,360
I swear I would love you

1181
01:14:32,735 --> 01:14:34,862
for the rest of my life.

1182
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:41,327
Did you say something?

1183
01:14:47,041 --> 01:14:48,626
Good night, Rita.

1184
01:14:49,836 --> 01:14:51,420
Good night.

1185
01:14:57,098 --> 01:15:00,598
#  And put your little hand in mine  #

1186
01:15:00,799 --> 01:15:06,799
#  There ain't no hill or mountain
we can't climb  #

1187
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:10,100
#  Babe  #

1188
01:15:10,101 --> 01:15:12,101
#  I got you, Babe  #

1189
01:15:13,402 --> 01:15:15,402
#  I got you, Babe  #

1190
01:15:16,576 --> 01:15:20,037
<i>Okay, campers, rise and shine!
And don't forget your booties.</i>

1191
01:15:20,288 --> 01:15:23,082
<i>- 'Cause it's cold out there today!
- It's cold out there every day!</i>

1192
01:15:23,291 --> 01:15:25,585
<i>- What is this, Miami Beach?
- Not hardly!</i>

1193
01:15:41,824 --> 01:15:45,024
#  Strike up the music
the band has begun  #

1194
01:15:46,025 --> 01:15:49,025
#  The Pennsylvania Polka  #

1195
01:15:49,626 --> 01:15:52,626
#  Pick out your partner
and join in the fun  #

1196
01:15:53,427 --> 01:15:56,427
#  The Pennsylvania Polka  #

1197
01:15:57,028 --> 01:16:00,028
#  It started in Scranton
It's now number one  #

1198
01:16:00,865 --> 01:16:04,226
Who wants coffee?
Get it while it's hot.

1199
01:16:04,227 --> 01:16:05,427
Oh. Thanks, Phil.

1200
01:16:05,428 --> 01:16:08,428
Larry?
Skim milk, two sugar.

1201
01:16:08,998 --> 01:16:10,333
Yeah. Thanks, Phil.

1202
01:16:10,334 --> 01:16:11,834
Pastry?

1203
01:16:11,959 --> 01:16:16,127
- No. We're just setting up.
- Pastry, Larry? Take your pick.

1204
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:18,424
Well, thanks, Phil.
Raspberry. Great.

1205
01:16:18,924 --> 01:16:22,094
Say, I was just talking with Buster Green,
he's the head groundhog honcho.

1206
01:16:22,345 --> 01:16:25,139
And he said if we set up over here
we might get a better shot.

1207
01:16:25,598 --> 01:16:27,850
- What do you think?
- Sounds good.

1208
01:16:28,184 --> 01:16:30,193
Larry, what do you think?

1209
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:32,605
Yeah. Let's go for it.

1210
01:16:32,855 --> 01:16:33,898
Good work, Phil.

1211
01:16:34,565 --> 01:16:37,902
Maybe we'll get lucky. Let me give you
a hand with the heavy stuff.

1212
01:16:39,362 --> 01:16:42,281
No, no. You got your coffee.
I'll get it.

1213
01:16:43,574 --> 01:16:45,451
We never talk, Larry.
Do you have kids?

1214
01:17:19,235 --> 01:17:20,235
Yes?

1215
01:17:20,236 --> 01:17:22,071
Yes. I'd like a piano lesson, please.

1216
01:17:22,405 --> 01:17:26,367
Oh, okay. I'm with a student now. But if you want
to come back tomorrow I could probably squeeze--

1217
01:17:26,575 --> 01:17:29,829
Well, I kind of want to get started.
I can give you $1,000.

1218
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:33,499
Come on in.

1219
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:55,104
Morning!
Off to see the groundhog?

1220
01:17:55,312 --> 01:17:57,356
<i>Buon giorno, signore!</i>

1221
01:17:58,357 --> 01:18:00,818
You think it's going to be
an early spring?

1222
01:18:01,068 --> 01:18:03,445
"Winter, slumbering in the open air

1223
01:18:03,696 --> 01:18:05,322
"Wears on his smiling face

1224
01:18:05,573 --> 01:18:07,783
"a dream of spring."

1225
01:18:08,033 --> 01:18:09,076
Ciao!

1226
01:18:10,369 --> 01:18:11,579
Ciao!

1227
01:18:43,099 --> 01:18:44,099
Phil!

1228
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,100
Rita. Hi.

1229
01:18:47,101 --> 01:18:48,601
Hey, Lar. Hi.

1230
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:50,951
How does she look?

1231
01:18:51,243 --> 01:18:52,328
Great.

1232
01:18:52,828 --> 01:18:53,746
Thank you.

1233
01:18:53,954 --> 01:18:57,416
- Did you know he could ice sculpt?
- No.

1234
01:19:11,472 --> 01:19:14,683
Not bad, Mr. Connors. You say
this is your first lesson?

1235
01:19:15,643 --> 01:19:18,896
Yes, but my father was
a piano mover, so

1236
01:19:23,317 --> 01:19:24,317
Phil?

1237
01:19:24,818 --> 01:19:29,323
- Phil Connors, I thought it was you.
- Ned Ryerson.

1238
01:19:31,033 --> 01:19:33,577
I have missed you so much.

1239
01:19:37,956 --> 01:19:41,502
I don't know where you're headed,
but can you call in sick?

1240
01:19:44,922 --> 01:19:46,840
I got to get going.

1241
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:49,760
It's good to see you, Phil.

1242
01:20:07,861 --> 01:20:09,321
Hello, father.

1243
01:20:10,072 --> 01:20:11,782
Let's get you someplace warm.

1244
01:20:12,116 --> 01:20:13,616
Yeah. Yeah.

1245
01:20:13,617 --> 01:20:14,993
Remember me?

1246
01:20:20,433 --> 01:20:21,833
Excuse me, sir?

1247
01:20:21,834 --> 01:20:25,044
- Are you the one who brought the old man in?
- M-hmm. How is he?

1248
01:20:25,504 --> 01:20:27,506
Well, he just passed away.

1249
01:20:29,258 --> 01:20:32,302
- What did he die of?
- He was just old.

1250
01:20:32,553 --> 01:20:34,388
It was just his time.

1251
01:20:37,141 --> 01:20:40,144
- I want to see his chart. Excuse me.
- Sir!

1252
01:20:40,519 --> 01:20:42,146
Sir, you can't come in here.

1253
01:20:42,396 --> 01:20:45,023
Sir, this is a restricted area.

1254
01:20:54,199 --> 01:20:55,868
Where's the chart?

1255
01:20:56,368 --> 01:20:58,704
Sometimes people just die.

1256
01:20:59,621 --> 01:21:01,081
Not today.

1257
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:15,679
Gets hard down there at the bottom.

1258
01:21:18,599 --> 01:21:19,808
Here you go.

1259
01:21:20,142 --> 01:21:21,268
Thank you.

1260
01:21:25,689 --> 01:21:26,773
Come on, dad.
Come one, pop.

1261
01:21:27,024 --> 01:21:28,400
Come on, pop.

1262
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:32,154
Come on. Come on.
Come on, breathe.

1263
01:21:32,404 --> 01:21:35,073
Breathe, pop! Breathe, pop!

1264
01:22:00,807 --> 01:22:03,477
When Chekhov saw the long winter

1265
01:22:03,936 --> 01:22:07,314
he saw a winter bleak and
dark and bereft of hope.

1266
01:22:07,564 --> 01:22:12,235
Yet we know winter is just another
step in the cycle of life.

1267
01:22:12,486 --> 01:22:16,156
But standing here, among the
people of Punxsutawney

1268
01:22:16,406 --> 01:22:19,201
and basking in the warmth of
their hearths and hearts

1269
01:22:20,285 --> 01:22:22,579
I couldn't imagine a better fate

1270
01:22:22,788 --> 01:22:25,749
than a long and lustrous winter.

1271
01:22:25,999 --> 01:22:28,794
From Punxsutawney,
it's Phil Connors.

1272
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:30,337
So long.

1273
01:22:32,214 --> 01:22:33,924
Nice speech, Phil. Very nice.

1274
01:22:34,174 --> 01:22:35,342
Thank you.

1275
01:22:35,543 --> 01:22:36,543
Thanks.

1276
01:22:36,677 --> 01:22:39,930
- How was that for you two?
- My man, you touched me.

1277
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:41,848
- Thanks, Larry.
- Thank you.

1278
01:22:43,225 --> 01:22:44,142
I got to go.

1279
01:22:44,143 --> 01:22:45,143
Phil.

1280
01:22:45,727 --> 01:22:49,773
That was surprising.
I didn't know you were so versatile.

1281
01:22:50,023 --> 01:22:51,692
I surprise myself sometimes.

1282
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,902
Well, where are you going?
Would you like to get a cup of coffee?

1283
01:22:54,111 --> 01:22:59,173
I'd love to. Can I have a rain check? I've
got some errands I've got to run. Okay?

1284
01:23:00,326 --> 01:23:01,626
Well, Phil!

1285
01:23:01,827 --> 01:23:03,745
Errands? What errands?

1286
01:23:03,995 --> 01:23:06,206
I thought we were going back.

1287
01:23:15,148 --> 01:23:17,148
Now hold it, fella.

1288
01:23:23,849 --> 01:23:26,685
What do you say? What do you say?
What do you say?

1289
01:23:26,893 --> 01:23:29,771
You little brat.
You have never thanked me!

1290
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:32,107
I'll see you tomorrow

1291
01:23:32,357 --> 01:23:33,442
maybe.

1292
01:23:41,158 --> 01:23:43,493
- You've totaled it.
- No.

1293
01:23:43,702 --> 01:23:47,831
- It's only a flat tire.
- What are we going to do?

1294
01:23:49,207 --> 01:23:52,627
- It's an earthquake!
- Oh, it's not an earthquake.

1295
01:23:52,836 --> 01:23:53,837
What is it?

1296
01:23:57,424 --> 01:23:59,509
Thank you, young man.

1297
01:24:00,635 --> 01:24:03,013
It's nothing, ma'am.
I had the tire and the jack.

1298
01:24:03,263 --> 01:24:05,891
Just be comfortable, all right.
It'll be a minute.

1299
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:07,350
Who is that?

1300
01:24:07,601 --> 01:24:10,353
He must be from the motor club.

1301
01:24:11,605 --> 01:24:14,274
Oh, my God! He is having a heart attack!
Do something!

1302
01:24:14,324 --> 01:24:18,612
- Well, what should I do?
- Call 911, an ambulance, a lawyer,
doctor, anything!

1303
01:24:25,869 --> 01:24:27,412
I think that did it.

1304
01:24:31,291 --> 01:24:34,369
If you're going to eat steak, get some
sharper teeth, all right?

1305
01:24:34,419 --> 01:24:36,755
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

1306
01:24:37,339 --> 01:24:38,673
Who was that?

1307
01:24:38,882 --> 01:24:41,593
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

1308
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:42,719
Eat, eat!

1309
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:48,683
<i>Well, people just don't understand</i>

1310
01:24:48,892 --> 01:24:51,686
what is involved in this.
This is an art form.

1311
01:24:51,937 --> 01:24:54,397
You know, I think that most
people just think that

1312
01:24:54,648 --> 01:24:57,817
I hold the camera and
point it at stuff.

1313
01:24:58,068 --> 01:25:00,962
There is a heck of a lot more
to it than just that.

1314
01:25:01,163 --> 01:25:02,163
Hey!

1315
01:25:02,164 --> 01:25:05,664
Would you be at all interested in
seeing the inside of a van?

1316
01:25:06,117 --> 01:25:09,412
Oh, you know, I really have to
get back to the party, but.

1317
01:25:09,663 --> 01:25:11,373
Great idea.
I think I'll go with you.

1318
01:25:11,623 --> 01:25:14,375
Yeah. Let me just drop a tip here.
Okay.

1319
01:25:19,423 --> 01:25:21,424
Rita! Hi! How are you?

1320
01:25:21,675 --> 01:25:23,468
- Rita, this is Nancy.
- Hi!

1321
01:25:23,469 --> 01:25:24,469
Nancy, Rita.

1322
01:25:24,594 --> 01:25:26,846
We were just going to go to the party.
You going to go?

1323
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:29,683
Yeah. Sounds like fun.
Maybe we should call Phil.

1324
01:25:29,684 --> 01:25:30,684
Phil Connors?

1325
01:25:30,767 --> 01:25:33,452
- I think he's already in there.
- Great.

1326
01:27:29,552 --> 01:27:30,803
Isn't he good?

1327
01:27:31,054 --> 01:27:32,180
He's great!

1328
01:27:32,430 --> 01:27:34,057
He's my student.

1329
01:27:36,684 --> 01:27:38,561
I'm so proud.

1330
01:27:39,729 --> 01:27:40,939
Thank you.

1331
01:27:42,106 --> 01:27:44,150
Hello, welcome to our party.

1332
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,653
Phil, I didn't know you could
play like that.

1333
01:27:46,903 --> 01:27:48,613
Oh, I'm versatile.

1334
01:27:55,995 --> 01:27:59,040
It's that nice young man
from the motor club.

1335
01:27:59,249 --> 01:28:00,750
Thank you again.

1336
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,418
It's nothing, ladies.

1337
01:28:02,669 --> 01:28:05,922
He's the fastest jack in
Jefferson County.

1338
01:28:08,383 --> 01:28:10,009
What was that all about?

1339
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:13,346
I really don't know. They've been
hitting on me all night.

1340
01:28:14,222 --> 01:28:15,598
There you are!

1341
01:28:17,558 --> 01:28:20,770
I never thanked you properly
for what you did for Buster.

1342
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:23,064
Well, he would've choked for sure.

1343
01:28:23,314 --> 01:28:27,026
Well, he may have. He was trying
to swallow a whole cow.

1344
01:28:27,277 --> 01:28:28,486
I owe you one, buddy.

1345
01:28:28,736 --> 01:28:31,864
Hang on to him, dear.
He's a real find.

1346
01:28:34,283 --> 01:28:35,994
What did you do today?

1347
01:28:36,244 --> 01:28:37,829
Oh, same old, same old.

1348
01:28:43,584 --> 01:28:45,128
Excuse me, Mr. Connors.

1349
01:28:45,336 --> 01:28:46,921
Hey, Fred, how was the wedding?

1350
01:28:47,171 --> 01:28:50,174
Well, I just wanted to thank you for making
Debbie go through with it and everything.

1351
01:28:50,425 --> 01:28:53,469
All I did was fan the flame of her
passion for you, Fred.

1352
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:54,929
You are the best.

1353
01:28:55,179 --> 01:28:56,222
No, you are the best.

1354
01:28:56,472 --> 01:28:59,642
- Rita, this is Debbie and Fred Kleiser.
- Hi.

1355
01:28:59,892 --> 01:29:03,730
- Here you go, kids. Congratulations.
- What is this?

1356
01:29:04,188 --> 01:29:06,024
No way!

1357
01:29:06,274 --> 01:29:09,402
Wrestlemania!
No way!

1358
01:29:10,361 --> 01:29:13,322
How'd you know?
We're going to be in Pittsburgh anyway!

1359
01:29:13,573 --> 01:29:15,408
Thank you, Mr. Connors.
You're a real pal.

1360
01:29:15,658 --> 01:29:18,035
Oh, this is the best.

1361
01:29:22,331 --> 01:29:23,950
I don't understand.

1362
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,710
Uh, yeah, I guess not.

1363
01:29:26,210 --> 01:29:28,963
How does everyone know you?
I mean, you only come here once a year.

1364
01:29:29,213 --> 01:29:31,048
You seem like the most popular
person in town.

1365
01:29:31,299 --> 01:29:33,509
- Excuse me. Dr. Connors?
- Yes?

1366
01:29:33,718 --> 01:29:36,637
I want to thank you for
fixing Felix's back.

1367
01:29:36,846 --> 01:29:38,931
He can even help around
the house again.

1368
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:41,642
Well, I'm sorry to hear
that, Felix.

1369
01:29:44,020 --> 01:29:45,646
Dr. Connors?

1370
01:29:46,022 --> 01:29:48,357
It's kind of an honorary title.

1371
01:29:48,608 --> 01:29:50,193
What is going on?

1372
01:29:50,401 --> 01:29:51,444
I really don't know.

1373
01:29:51,694 --> 01:29:54,155
No, there is something
going on with you.

1374
01:29:54,739 --> 01:29:56,699
Would you like the long version
or the short one?

1375
01:29:56,949 --> 01:29:59,786
Let's start with the short
and go from there.

1376
01:30:05,583 --> 01:30:07,585
Okay, folks, attention.

1377
01:30:08,377 --> 01:30:11,506
Time for the big bachelor auction.
Now you all know the rules.

1378
01:30:11,756 --> 01:30:14,217
All the eligible bachelors
come down in front.

1379
01:30:14,509 --> 01:30:15,968
And you ladies

1380
01:30:16,219 --> 01:30:17,553
you bid on them!

1381
01:30:17,803 --> 01:30:19,847
You get to do whatever
you want with them,

1382
01:30:20,097 --> 01:30:21,682
no questions asked!

1383
01:30:21,933 --> 01:30:25,019
I don't want to know about it,
as long as it's legal.

1384
01:30:25,228 --> 01:30:29,607
Okay, so get out your pocketbooks,
and remember it's all for charity.

1385
01:30:29,608 --> 01:30:30,608
Phil!

1386
01:30:31,776 --> 01:30:33,361
What are you doing down here?

1387
01:30:33,611 --> 01:30:35,112
Go on, get up there.

1388
01:30:35,321 --> 01:30:38,407
I got 10 bucks that
says you're mine.

1389
01:30:38,824 --> 01:30:40,743
Hey, Buster, I got your first victim.

1390
01:30:40,952 --> 01:30:43,621
Phil Connors, come on up here!

1391
01:30:48,668 --> 01:30:52,004
All right! Now, what am I bid
for this fine specimen?

1392
01:30:52,296 --> 01:30:53,714
Five dollars!

1393
01:30:53,923 --> 01:30:55,883
The bidding has begun
at five dollars.

1394
01:30:56,175 --> 01:30:57,426
Ten dollars!

1395
01:30:57,635 --> 01:30:58,844
Fifteen!

1396
01:30:59,053 --> 01:31:01,055
- Twenty!
- Twenty-five!

1397
01:31:01,264 --> 01:31:02,223
Thirty!

1398
01:31:02,431 --> 01:31:04,225
- Thirty-five!
- Forty!

1399
01:31:04,433 --> 01:31:05,434
Forty-five!

1400
01:31:06,102 --> 01:31:07,144
Fifty!

1401
01:31:07,395 --> 01:31:08,354
Fifty-five!

1402
01:31:08,562 --> 01:31:09,563
Sixty!

1403
01:31:09,772 --> 01:31:11,440
I'm bid $60.
Do I hear more?

1404
01:31:15,236 --> 01:31:18,406
$339.88.

1405
01:31:22,326 --> 01:31:26,163
Well, I don't think we can accept any
more bids. I think that's sold

1406
01:31:26,414 --> 01:31:30,084
to the little lady for $339.88!

1407
01:31:31,210 --> 01:31:32,586
Congratulations!

1408
01:31:40,678 --> 01:31:42,596
Okay, bachelors, who's next?

1409
01:31:53,024 --> 01:31:56,319
All right! Now, what am I
bid for this guy?

1410
01:31:56,527 --> 01:31:58,362
Do I hear a buck and a half?

1411
01:31:58,654 --> 01:31:59,905
Anybody?

1412
01:32:00,781 --> 01:32:01,824
75 cents?

1413
01:32:02,033 --> 01:32:03,826
I bid a two bits!

1414
01:32:04,452 --> 01:32:06,829
Sold to the lady for 25 cents.

1415
01:32:07,038 --> 01:32:08,581
I got him!

1416
01:32:08,582 --> 01:32:09,582
Oh!

1417
01:32:15,038 --> 01:32:16,038
Phil?

1418
01:32:16,039 --> 01:32:16,839
Phil.

1419
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:19,551
Phil Connors,
I thought that was you.

1420
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:22,261
Rita, this is Ned Ryerson, he's
my new insurance agent.

1421
01:32:22,511 --> 01:32:23,763
I'll say.

1422
01:32:24,972 --> 01:32:26,932
I have not seen this guy for 20 years.

1423
01:32:27,183 --> 01:32:32,229
He comes up and then he buys whole life,
term, uniflex, fire, theft, auto, dental, health

1424
01:32:32,438 --> 01:32:35,357
with the optional death and
dismemberment plan, water damage.

1425
01:32:35,408 --> 01:32:37,777
Phil, this is the best day of my life.

1426
01:32:38,027 --> 01:32:40,154
- Mine, too.
- Mine, too.

1427
01:32:40,362 --> 01:32:41,614
Where are we going?

1428
01:32:41,864 --> 01:32:43,574
Oh, let's not spoil it.

1429
01:32:45,117 --> 01:32:47,745
Let's not--Oh!
I got that.

1430
01:32:50,664 --> 01:32:52,082
Why can't I look?

1431
01:32:52,541 --> 01:32:54,376
Because you bother me.
A lot.

1432
01:32:54,668 --> 01:32:56,045
I'm getting cold.

1433
01:32:56,253 --> 01:32:57,880
How much longer do I
have to sit here?

1434
01:32:58,506 --> 01:33:02,134
I'm just trying to give you your money's
worth. You paid top dollar for me.

1435
01:33:02,218 --> 01:33:04,553
Well, I think you were a bargain.

1436
01:33:05,387 --> 01:33:07,515
Sweet of you to say.
You're probably right.

1437
01:33:10,267 --> 01:33:11,685
Is it finished yet?

1438
01:33:12,561 --> 01:33:15,439
Almost. I still have to put some
cherry syrup on the top

1439
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:16,690
and then we can eat it.

1440
01:33:16,941 --> 01:33:19,610
Come on, Phil.
I'm freezing!

1441
01:33:19,819 --> 01:33:21,487
One second, one second.
All right.

1442
01:33:21,737 --> 01:33:23,531
Let me turn it in the light.

1443
01:33:29,036 --> 01:33:30,538
It's amazing.

1444
01:33:31,288 --> 01:33:32,540
It's beautiful.

1445
01:33:36,836 --> 01:33:38,212
How did you do that?

1446
01:33:39,046 --> 01:33:42,841
I know your face so well,
I could've done it with my eyes closed.

1447
01:33:47,388 --> 01:33:48,806
It's lovely.

1448
01:33:49,557 --> 01:33:51,392
I don't know what to say.

1449
01:33:52,601 --> 01:33:53,811
I do.

1450
01:33:55,896 --> 01:33:58,190
No matter what happens tomorrow,

1451
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:00,317
or for the rest of my life,

1452
01:34:00,526 --> 01:34:02,236
I'm happy now

1453
01:34:03,445 --> 01:34:05,030
because I love you.

1454
01:34:05,948 --> 01:34:07,741
I think I'm happy too.

1455
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:52,600
#  Babe  #

1456
01:34:52,601 --> 01:34:54,601
#  I got you, Babe  #

1457
01:34:55,902 --> 01:34:57,902
#  I got you, Babe  #

1458
01:34:59,603 --> 01:35:03,103
#  They say our love won't
pay the rent  #

1459
01:35:03,104 --> 01:35:05,104
#  Before it's earned  #

1460
01:35:05,105 --> 01:35:07,405
<i>- #  Our money's all been spent  #
- Oh, please. Not again.</i>

1461
01:35:07,801 --> 01:35:09,678
<i>- That is a great song.
- No, it's not.</i>

1462
01:35:09,928 --> 01:35:11,972
<i>Don't listen to this man, he's</i>

1463
01:35:12,556 --> 01:35:14,975
It's too early.

1464
01:35:25,694 --> 01:35:27,488
Something is different.

1465
01:35:28,113 --> 01:35:29,364
Good or bad?

1466
01:35:29,740 --> 01:35:32,034
Anything different is good.

1467
01:35:34,495 --> 01:35:36,789
But this could be real good.

1468
01:35:41,668 --> 01:35:43,087
Why are you here?

1469
01:35:43,545 --> 01:35:45,631
I bought you.
I own you.

1470
01:35:48,133 --> 01:35:49,718
But why are you still here?

1471
01:35:49,968 --> 01:35:53,055
You said, "Stay," so I stayed.

1472
01:35:55,724 --> 01:35:57,768
I said, "Stay," so you stayed.

1473
01:35:58,018 --> 01:36:00,562
I can't even make a collie stay.

1474
01:36:02,731 --> 01:36:04,733
I got to check something.

1475
01:36:05,526 --> 01:36:06,902
Stay.

1476
01:36:07,319 --> 01:36:08,445
Stay.

1477
01:36:14,076 --> 01:36:15,369
They're gone!

1478
01:36:16,286 --> 01:36:17,871
They're all gone.

1479
01:36:19,957 --> 01:36:22,668
- Do you know what today is?
- No, what?

1480
01:36:24,002 --> 01:36:26,004
Today is tomorrow.

1481
01:36:26,588 --> 01:36:27,923
It happened.

1482
01:36:30,175 --> 01:36:32,427
- You're here.
- I'm here.

1483
01:36:35,798 --> 01:36:40,728
Oh, Phil! Why weren't you like
this last night? You just fell asleep.

1484
01:36:43,063 --> 01:36:45,858
It was the end of a very long day.

1485
01:36:48,944 --> 01:36:52,739
Is there anything I can do
for you today?

1486
01:36:53,615 --> 01:36:56,243
I'm sure I can think of something.

1487
01:37:29,359 --> 01:37:31,361
It's so beautiful!

1488
01:37:41,997 --> 01:37:43,624
Let's live here.

1489
01:37:53,592 --> 01:37:55,636
We'll rent to start.

1490
01:37:56,337 --> 01:37:58,837
#  What a day this has been!  #

1491
01:37:58,838 --> 01:38:01,338
#  What a rare mood I'm in!  #

1492
01:38:01,339 --> 01:38:05,139
#  Why, it's almost like being in love!  #

1493
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:11,940
#  There's a smile on my face
for the whole human race!  #

1494
01:38:11,941 --> 01:38:15,741
#  Why, it's almost like being in love!  #

1495
01:38:16,742 --> 01:38:21,742
#  All the music of life seems to be  #

1496
01:38:22,043 --> 01:38:26,543
#  Like a bell that is ringing for me!  #

1497
01:38:26,744 --> 01:38:29,944
#  And from the way that I feel  #

1498
01:38:29,945 --> 01:38:32,745
#  When that bell starts to peal  #

1499
01:38:32,746 --> 01:38:35,746
#  I would swear I was falling  #

1500
01:38:35,747 --> 01:38:38,047
#  Swear I was falling  #

1501
01:38:38,048 --> 01:38:44,048
#  It's almost like being in love.  #
