1
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:56,713
<i>Somebody asked me today...</i>

2
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,226
<i>"Phil, if you could be anywhere,</i>
<i>where would you like to be?"</i>

3
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:03,057
<i>I said to him,</i>
<i>"Probably right here."</i>

4
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:06,394
Elko, Nevada.
Our nation's high at 79 today.

5
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:09,230
In California,
they'll have warm weather tomorrow...

6
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:12,066
gang wars and some
very overpriced real estate.

7
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:17,007
Up in the Pacific Northwest,
they'll have some very tall trees.

8
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,011
It will be clear across
the Rockies and the Great Plains.

9
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,048
But look out,
here comes trouble.

10
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:28,250
Oh, boy!
Front coming our way. Look out.

11
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,414
What will that mean to us
in the Three Rivers area?

12
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,221
One of these big blue things!
This cold, frigid, Arctic air.

13
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,228
This big mass out of the north.

14
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:40,426
It will meet up with all this moisture
coming out of the Gulf...

15
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,025
mix together at high altitudes
and cause some snow.

16
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:48,438
It won't hit us here in Pittsburgh.
It will push off and hit Altoona.

17
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,066
Close call.

18
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,269
Let's take a look
at the five-day.

19
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:55,781
Nothing to be too scared about.

20
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:59,615
Bundle up warm,
but leave your galoshes at home.

21
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,449
I won't be here for the 10:00.

22
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,786
Tomorrow is Groundhog Day,
and I'm going out to Punxsutawney...

23
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,452
for our country's
oldest groundhog festival.

24
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:10,963
According to the legend,
tomorrow, February 2...

25
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:14,956
if the groundhog sees his shadow,
we'll have six more weeks of winter.

26
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,629
- Keep your fingers crossed.
- Sounds like a lot of fun.

27
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:21,470
This is your third year in a row
isn't it?

28
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,974
Four, Nan.

29
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,643
Thanks, Phil.

30
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:30,308
Up next: Diane Kingman looks
at sex and violence in the movies.

31
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:31,816
Stay with us.

32
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,849
- We're clear.
- Have fun in Punxsutawney.

33
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,325
For your information, Hairdo...

34
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,988
there is a major network
interested in me.

35
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,124
That would be
the Home Shopping Network.

36
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:51,328
Thanks, Larry.
Go wait in the van.

37
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,998
That was nice.
"Big trees."

38
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,136
Stop, Henny.
Can you handle the 10:00 or not?

39
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:02,010
If you don't want to rush back,
I can do the 5:00 tomorrow.

40
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:05,506
I want to stay an extra second
in Punxsutawney? Please!

41
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:09,851
Rita thinks it would be great to stay
for some of the other events...

42
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,618
get some incredible footage.

43
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,353
The people and the fun,
the excitement.

44
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:17,590
You haven't worked with her yet.
She's really nice.

45
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,064
She's gonna be a really good producer.

46
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,735
You guys will have fun.

47
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:30,603
She's fun, but not my kind of fun.
I will be here for the 5:00. Rita.

48
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,772
Can you keep a secret, Larry?

49
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,275
I'm probably leaving PBH.

50
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:41,871
So this will be the last time
we do the Groundhog together.

51
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:45,440
What's wrong
with the Groundhog Festival?

52
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:50,581
In San Diego, I covered the swallows
returning to Capistrano six years.

53
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,251
Someday somebody will see me
interviewing a groundhog...

54
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,452
and think I don't have a future.

55
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,962
I think it's a nice story.

56
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,795
He comes out,
and he looks around.

57
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:04,803
He wrinkles up his little nose.
He sees his shadow or he doesn't see it.

58
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,101
It's nice. People like it.

59
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:10,108
You are new, aren't you?

60
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,235
People like blood sausage too.

61
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,006
People are morons.

62
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,275
Nice attitude.

63
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:20,819
Look in the mirror and see what you
look like doing that groundhog thing.

64
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,320
For me? Once?

65
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:26,484
He comes out
and looks at his little shadow.

66
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:31,693
- Would you like some blood sausage?
- I like blood sausage.

67
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,187
Rita, I can't stay here.

68
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,717
- Prima donna.
- I'll handle it. What's the matter?

69
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,560
I hate this place. I stayed here
two years ago. I was miserable.

70
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:43,466
- It's a fleabag. I'm not staying here.
- You're not staying here.

71
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,663
I'm not?

72
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,174
Larry's dropping me off. I booked you
in a nice bed-and-breakfast.

73
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:56,745
Great. I think this is the trait
of a really good producer:

74
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,511
Keep the talent happy.

75
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,176
Anything I can do.

76
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,245
Would you help me
with my pelvic tilt?

77
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,420
Within reason.

78
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,551
Would you like to have dinner
with Larry and me?

79
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:11,756
No, thank you.
I've seen Larry eat.

80
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:17,068
Get your sleep.
I'll see you in the morning.

81
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,472
Don't be late.

82
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,235
Did he actually
call himself"the talent"?

83
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,306
<i>Okay, campers, rise and shine.</i>

84
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,274
<i>Don't forget your booties</i>
<i>because it's cold out there today.</i>

85
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:00,278
<i>It's cold out there every day.</i>
<i>What is this, Miami Beach?</i>

86
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:05,978
<i>Not hardly. You can expect hazardous</i>
<i>travel later with that blizzard thing.</i>

87
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:09,647
<i>"That blizzard thing"?</i>
<i>Here's the report.</i>

88
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:13,283
<i>The National Weather Service</i>
<i>is calling for a big blizzard thing.</i>

89
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:17,295
<i>They are. But there's another reason</i>
<i>why today is especially exciting.</i>

90
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,126
<i>Especially cold.</i>

91
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,257
<i>The big question</i>
<i>on everybody's lips...</i>

92
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,826
<i>On their chapped lips.</i>

93
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,839
<i>Do you think Phil will come out</i>
<i>and see his shadow?</i>

94
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,671
- <i>Punxsutawney Phil.</i>
- <i>That's right, woodchuck chuckers.</i>

95
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,836
<i>It's Groundhog Day!</i>

96
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:38,111
- <i>Get up and check that hog!</i>
- <i>Come here, groundhog!</i>

97
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,519
Good morning.

98
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,680
- You off to see the groundhog?
- I am.

99
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,020
Do you think
it will be an early spring?

100
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,856
I'm predicting March 21.

101
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,021
Good guess.

102
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:54,464
I think that actually is
the first day of spring.

103
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,538
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

104
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,543
I slept alone, Mrs. Lancaster.

105
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,880
- Would you like some coffee?
- Is there any possibility...

106
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,884
of getting an espresso
or a cappuccino this morning?

107
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,352
I really don't know.

108
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,514
How to spell "espresso"
or "cappuccino."

109
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,181
This looks fine.

110
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:22,716
- I hope you enjoy the festivities.
- I'm sure I will.

111
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,956
There's talk of a blizzard.

112
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:28,728
We may catch a break
and have that blizzard blow by us.

113
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,201
All this moisture coming up
out of the south...

114
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,738
will probably push on
east of us.

115
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:37,207
At high altitudes it will crystallize
and give us what we call snow.

116
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,903
Probably will be some accumulation...

117
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:42,812
but here in Punxsutawney our high
will be about 30 today, teens tonight.

118
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:46,818
Chance of precipitation
about 20 percent today and tomorrow.

119
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,980
Did you want to talk about the weather
or were you just making chitchat?

120
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:54,220
- Chitchat.
- See you later.

121
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:58,525
- Bye.
- Will you be checking out today?

122
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:01,759
Chance of departure today:
100 percent.

123
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:27,021
Phil Connors?
I thought that was you!

124
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,425
How you doing?
Thanks for watching.

125
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:34,159
Don't tell me you don't remember me.
I sure as heck-fire remember you.

126
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:40,866
- Not a chance.
- Ned Ryerson!

127
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,364
Needlenose Ned.
Ned the Head.

128
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:46,002
Come on, buddy.
Case Western High.

129
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:51,106
I did the whistling belly button trick
at the high school talent show. Bing!

130
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:55,244
Got the shingles real bad senior year,
almost didn't graduate.

131
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,414
Bing again!

132
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,722
I dated your sister Mary Pat
till you told me not to anymore.

133
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,435
Did you turn pro
with that belly button thing or what?

134
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,995
- I sell insurance.
- What a shock.

135
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,737
Do you have life insurance?
You could always use a little more.

136
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,075
Am I right or am I right
or am I right? Right?

137
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:27,017
I would love to stand here and talk
with you, but I'm not going to.

138
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:30,318
- See you.
- I'll walk with you.

139
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,324
Whenever I see an opportunity now,
I charge it like a bull.

140
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,485
Ned the Bull, that's me now.

141
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:39,497
I have friends who live and die
by the actuarial tables.

142
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,500
It's all one big crap shoot.

143
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,866
Have you ever heard
of single premium life?

144
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,701
I think that really could be
the ticket for you.

145
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:52,176
God!
It is so good to see you!

146
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:55,179
- What are you doing for dinner?
- Something else.

147
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:58,705
It's been great seeing you,
Needlehead. Take care.

148
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:06,349
Watch out for that first step.
It's a doozy!

149
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:16,534
<i>Strike up the music</i>
<i>The band has begun</i>

150
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:20,038
<i>The Pennsylvania Polka</i>

151
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:24,372
<i>Pick out your partner</i>
<i>and join in the fun</i>

152
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:31,879
<i>It started in Scranton</i>
<i>It's now number one</i>

153
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,784
<i>It's gonna entertain you</i>

154
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,320
Phil, over here!

155
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,051
Where have you been?

156
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:44,222
It was horrible.
A giant leech got me.

157
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:47,060
You're missing all the fun.
These people are great.

158
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,227
Some have been partying all night.
They sing until they get too cold...

159
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:55,239
then they sit by the fire,
get warm and sing some more.

160
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,409
They're hicks, Rita.

161
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:03,938
Did you sleep okay without me?
You tossed and turned, didn't you?

162
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,849
- You're incredible.
- Who told you?

163
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,082
It's groundhog time.

164
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,722
On me in three.

165
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,659
Two, one.

166
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:23,430
Once a year, the eyes of the nation turn
to this tiny Pennsylvania hamlet...

167
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,436
to watch a master at work.

168
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:28,098
The master?
Punxsutawney Phil...

169
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:31,610
the world's most famous weatherman,
the groundhog...

170
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:35,977
who, as legend has it, can predict
the coming of an early spring.

171
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:41,078
The question we have to ask ourselves
today is, "Does Phil feel lucky?"

172
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,612
Then it's the same old schtick.

173
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,454
The guy with the big stick
raps on the door.

174
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:50,461
They pull the little rat out.
They talk to him.

175
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,862
The rat talks back and then
they tell us what's gonna happen.

176
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,463
Isn't he cute?

177
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,509
You like your guys
with prominent upper teeth?

178
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:22,019
"This February 2,
at 7:20 and 30 seconds...

179
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:25,497
Punxsutawney Phil,
the seer of seers...

180
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:28,624
prognosticator
of prognosticators...

181
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:32,137
emerged reluctantly,
but alertly...

182
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,399
in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania...

183
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:37,340
and stated in Groundhogese...

184
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,707
'I definitely see a shadow."'

185
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:46,381
Sorry, folks.
Six more weeks of winter.

186
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:55,853
On me in three. Two, one.

187
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:59,692
Television really fails to capture
the true excitement...

188
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:03,030
of a large squirrel
predicting the weather.

189
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,195
I, for one, am very grateful
to have been here.

190
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:09,332
From Punxsutawney,
this is Phil Connors. So long.

191
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,899
Want to try it again
without the sarcasm?

192
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:14,207
We got it.
I'm out of here.

193
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,044
Prima donnas.

194
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,359
Boy, take a look at this.

195
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,526
- What is going on?
- I don't know.

196
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,332
Perhaps it's that giant blizzard
we're not supposed to get.

197
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,066
This is impossible.

198
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,437
Nobody honks this horn but me, pal.

199
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,333
Take this rig out of here.

200
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,427
Commander, what's going on?

201
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,563
There's nothing going on.
We're closing the road.

202
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,406
- Big blizzard moving in.
- What blizzard? It's a couple flakes.

203
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,344
Don't you listen to the weather?
We got a major storm here.

204
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,608
I make the weather!

205
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,116
All this moisture coming up
out of the Gulf...

206
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,745
will push off to the east
and hit Altoona.

207
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,449
Pal, you got that moisture
on your head.

208
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:36,119
You can go back to Punxsutawney
or you can freeze to death.

209
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:39,631
It's your choice.
What's it gonna be?

210
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,758
I'm thinking.

211
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:47,499
All the long-distance lines
are down?

212
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:53,336
What about the satellite?
Is it snowing in space?

213
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:58,975
Don't you have a line you keep open
for emergencies or for celebrities?

214
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:02,986
I'm both.
I'm a celebrity in an emergency.

215
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,522
Can you patch me through
on that line, please?

216
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,523
Can I have one more
with booze in it?

217
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,361
I like it here.

218
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:22,203
Phil, are you going
to the groundhog dinner?

219
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:25,038
I had groundhog for lunch.
It wasn't bad.

220
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,670
Tastes like chicken.
You two run along.

221
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:31,711
Looking foxy tonight, man.

222
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,878
Is your troop selling cookies
again this year?

223
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,319
That's so funny, Phil.

224
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,016
What are you gonna do?

225
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:42,720
I'm going back to my room
and take a hot shower.

226
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,696
Maybe read <i>Hustler</i>
or something.

227
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,197
Suit yourself.

228
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,737
God!

229
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,412
Yo, Mom.
Isn't there any hot water?

230
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,047
There wouldn't be today.

231
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,920
Of course not.
Silly me.

232
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,425
Sweet dreams.

233
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,287
Nice going, boys.
You're playing yesterday's tape.

234
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:09,980
Chapped lips.

235
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,791
What the hell?

236
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:40,678
Good morning.
Off to see the groundhog?

237
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,340
Think it will be an early spring?

238
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,849
Didn't we do this yesterday?

239
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,182
I don't know what you mean.

240
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,517
Don't mess with me, Pork Chop.

241
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:55,686
- What day is this?
- It's February 2. Groundhog Day.

242
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,524
I thought it was yesterday.

243
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,383
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

244
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,392
Did I sleep well?

245
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:33,227
- Would you like some coffee?
- Please. I think I'll have a double.

246
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:36,028
I hope you enjoy the festivities.

247
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:38,399
There's talk of a blizzard.

248
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,407
Do you ever have deja vu?

249
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:46,410
I don't think so,
but I could check with the kitchen.

250
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,412
That's okay. Thank you.

251
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,582
Will you be checking out today?

252
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:58,589
I'd say the chance of departure
is 80 percent.

253
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,616
Seventy-five, eighty.

254
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:08,857
Excuse me.

255
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,698
Where is everybody going?

256
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,171
To Gobbler's Knob.
It's Groundhog Day.

257
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,936
It's still just once a year,
isn't it?

258
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,455
Phil Connors.
I thought that was you.

259
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:39,763
Don't you say you don't remember me.
I sure as heck-fire remember you.

260
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,462
Ned Ryerson?

261
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:46,095
Bing!
First shot right out of the box!

262
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:49,106
How's it going, old buddy?

263
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:52,109
Actually, I'm not feeling well.
Would you excuse me?

264
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,645
It's funny
you should mention your health.

265
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:57,477
You will never guess what I do now.

266
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,643
- Do you sell insurance?
- Bing again!

267
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,778
You are sharp as a tack today.

268
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:07,484
Do you have life insurance?
If you do, you could always use more.

269
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,652
Right?
Who couldn't?

270
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:15,291
You know something?
I got a feeling you ain't got any.

271
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,860
- Am I right or am I right?
- I gotta go.

272
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:27,838
Watch out for that first step.
It's a doozy.

273
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,005
Phil, over here!

274
00:22:57,242 --> 00:23:00,006
- Where have you been?
- Rita, do me a favor.

275
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:03,377
I need someone to give me
a good hard slap in the face.

276
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,441
- How's that?
- Good.

277
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,387
If you need help with the other cheek,
let me know. I'm right here.

278
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:16,189
- Something's going on.
- Are you drunk or something?

279
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:19,890
Drunk's more fun.
Can I be serious for a minute?

280
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:23,196
- I don't know. Can you?
- I'm being serious.

281
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:27,329
I'm having a problem.
I may be having a problem.

282
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:32,334
- It's groundhog time.
- I knew you would say that.

283
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:36,039
I really feel weird.

284
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,548
Let's just do this,
then we'll talk.

285
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,313
On me in three.

286
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,286
Two, one.

287
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:48,383
It's Groundhog Day again.

288
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:52,759
That must mean we're at Gobbler's Knob
waiting for the forecast...

289
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,391
from the world's most famous
groundhog weatherman...

290
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,058
Punxsutawney Phil...

291
00:23:57,135 --> 00:24:00,764
who's just about to tell us
how much more winter we can expect.

292
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:08,145
This is a riot.

293
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,913
Isn't he cute?

294
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,968
Yeah, Sport,
I know there's a blizzard.

295
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,275
When are the long-distance lines
gonna be repaired?

296
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:47,818
What if there is no tomorrow?
There wasn't one today.

297
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,120
Hello?

298
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:48,007
Good morning.
Off to see the groundhog?

299
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:56,777
Did you sleep well, Mr...

300
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:13,202
I thought...

301
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:18,037
Don't say you don't remember me.
I sure as heck-fire remember you.

302
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:20,373
It's me, Ned Ryerson!

303
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:23,073
Needlenose Ned. Ned the Head.
Come on, buddy. Case Western...

304
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,883
Over here!

305
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:34,392
- Where have you been?
- Can we talk about a nonwork matter?

306
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:37,394
- You never talk about work.
- We really have to talk. Come on.

307
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:40,761
- It's a creative meeting. Forget it.
- Wait a second. We've got work to do.

308
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:43,596
I don't.
I've already done it twice.

309
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:46,603
When you get finished,
meet me in the diner.

310
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,234
- What's that all about?
- I don't know.

311
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,039
Prima donnas.

312
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,548
More coffee, hon?

313
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,413
No, thanks.
Just the check, please.

314
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:04,251
- These sticky buns are heaven.
- Aren't they?

315
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,250
Just put that anywhere, pal.

316
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:09,793
Good save.

317
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,923
Tell me why you're too sick to work,
and it better be good.

318
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:21,264
I'm reliving the same day
over and over.

319
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:24,274
Groundhog Day. Today.

320
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:26,276
I'm waiting for the punch line.

321
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:30,804
Really.
This is the third time.

322
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:32,873
It's like yesterday never happened.

323
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:37,047
I am racking my brain, but I can't
imagine why you'd make this up.

324
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:40,751
I'm not making it up.
I am asking you for help!

325
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,191
What do you want me to do?

326
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:46,753
I don't know! You're a producer,
come up with something.

327
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,321
You want my advice?

328
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,303
You should get your head examined
if you expect me to believe that story.

329
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:55,168
Like the groundhog Phil?

330
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:00,977
Look out for your shadow, pal.

331
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,746
Morons, your bus is leaving.

332
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,580
You guys ready?
We better get going...

333
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,655
- to stay ahead of the weather.
- Let's talk back in Pittsburgh.

334
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:13,246
I'm not going back to Pittsburgh.

335
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:15,792
- Why not?
- Because of the blizzard.

336
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,158
You said that would hit Altoona.

337
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:21,858
I know that's what I said.

338
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:24,697
I think you need help.

339
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:27,863
That's what I've been saying.
I need help.

340
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:32,001
No spots, no clots...

341
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:35,012
no tumors, no <i>lesions...</i>

342
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,877
no aneurisms.

343
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,882
None that I can see.

344
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:42,716
If you want a CAT scan or an MRI,
you have to go into Pittsburgh.

345
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:45,187
I can't go into Pittsburgh.

346
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:48,521
- Why can't you go into Pittsburgh?
- There's a blizzard.

347
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:50,527
Right. The blizzard.

348
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:53,894
You know what you may need,
Mr. Connors?

349
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:55,899
A biopsy.

350
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,366
A psychiatrist.

351
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:03,173
That's an unusual problem,
Mr. Connors.

352
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:08,173
Most of my work is
with couples, families.

353
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,679
I have an alcoholic now.

354
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:16,219
You went to college, right?
It wasn't veterinary psychology, was it?

355
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:19,745
Didn't you take some course
that covered this stuff?

356
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:22,384
Sort of. I guess.

357
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:25,659
Abnormal psychology.

358
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:30,463
So, what do I do?

359
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,594
I think we should meet again.

360
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,571
How's tomorrow for you?

361
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,709
Is that not good?

362
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:53,423
I was in the Virgin Islands once.

363
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:55,584
I met a girl.

364
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,426
We ate lobster,
drank pina coladas.

365
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:02,125
At sunset,
we made love like sea otters.

366
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:08,430
That was a pretty good day.

367
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:14,172
Why couldn't I get that day
over and over and over?

368
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,112
You know, some guys
would look at this glass...

369
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:20,117
and they would say,
"That glass is half empty."

370
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:23,985
Other guys would say,
"That glass is half full."

371
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:27,617
I peg you as a "glass is half empty"
kind of guy. Am I right?

372
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,126
What would you do
if you were stuck in one place...

373
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:37,134
and every day was exactly the same,
and nothing that you did mattered?

374
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:42,472
That sums it up for me.

375
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,846
Good luck.
I'll drop you off.

376
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:59,754
- This thing sticks. You gotta jiggle it.
- Come on up here.

377
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:04,022
- My gosh.
- Give me your keys, pal.

378
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:07,998
Friends don't let friends drive.
Stand up here. Take a deep breath.

379
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,000
You feel okay? Really?

380
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,501
You're all right.

381
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:21,011
You want to throw up here
or in the car?

382
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:26,142
- I think both.
- Come on.

383
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,359
I don't think I should be driving.

384
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:40,693
I don't either.
Watch your head.

385
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:43,029
Watch your knees.
Don't break anything.

386
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:46,434
All right.
Let's not forget seat belts.

387
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:51,533
Who else could go
for some flapjacks right now?

388
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,708
Let me ask you guys a question.

389
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:03,049
- Shoot.
- What if there were no tomorrow?

390
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:07,057
No tomorrow? That would mean
there would be no consequences.

391
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:11,459
There would be no hangovers.
We could do whatever we wanted!

392
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:17,397
That's true.
We could do whatever we want.

393
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:26,636
If we wanted to hit mailboxes,
we could let Ralph drive!

394
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:36,248
- I think they want you to stop.
- Hang on.

395
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,023
It's the same thing
your whole life:

396
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:47,394
"Clean up your room." " Stand up
straight." " Pick up your feet."

397
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:51,993
"Take it like a man."
"Be nice to your sister."

398
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,595
"Don't mix beer and wine, ever."

399
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,608
"Don't drive
on the railroad tracks."

400
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,474
Phil, that's one
I happen to agree with.

401
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:13,289
I don't know, Gus.

402
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:18,853
Sometimes I think you just have
to take the big chances.

403
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,455
<i>This is the police!</i>
<i>Pull over immediately!</i>

404
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,964
We're talking in here.

405
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,133
I'm betting he'll swerve first.

406
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:49,658
I'm not gonna live
by their rules anymore.

407
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:54,221
- I noticed that.
- You make choices and live with them.

408
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:09,936
My knee.

409
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,718
Let me handle this.

410
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:20,053
Three cheeseburgers,
two large fries...

411
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,217
two chocolate shakes
and one large Coke.

412
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:26,525
- And some flapjacks.
- Too early for flapjacks?

413
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,414
Rise and shine, campers!

414
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:47,246
Don't forget your booties
because it's cold out there today!

415
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:52,449
It's cold out there every day.
What is this, Miami Beach? Not hardly.

416
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,591
Slept like a baby.
Thank you.

417
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:01,257
- I'd love some of your coffee.
- I hope...

418
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:05,098
Flurries moving in later, but
the blizzard will hit outside of town.

419
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:08,764
Mrs. Lancaster, was anybody
looking for me here this morning?

420
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,072
Perhaps a state official?
Maybe a blue hat, gun, nightstick?

421
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,771
No one like that.
Will there be?

422
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,280
Apparently not.

423
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:22,778
Hold my room for me, please.
I'm staying an extra day.

424
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,851
Catch you tomorrow, Pops.

425
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:13,333
I like to see a man of advancing years
throwing caution to the wind.

426
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:16,498
It's inspiring, in a way.

427
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:19,099
My years are not advancing
as fast as you might think.

428
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,643
More coffee, hon?

429
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:22,474
Just keep it coming, please.

430
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:23,980
Sure thing.

431
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,344
Just put that anywhere, pal.

432
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:29,852
Good save.

433
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:35,586
Don't you worry about cholesterol,
lung cancer, love handles?

434
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,593
I don't worry
about anything anymore.

435
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:42,428
What makes you so special?
Everybody worries about something.

436
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:47,494
That's exactly what makes me so special.
I don't even have to floss.

437
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:58,146
What?

438
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:03,982
"The wretch,
concentered all in self...

439
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:06,512
Living,
shall forfeit fair renown...

440
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:09,856
And, doubly dying,
shall go down...

441
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:13,226
To the vile dust,
from whence he sprung...

442
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:17,358
Unwept, unhonor'd, and unsung."

443
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,903
Sir Walter Scott.

444
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:26,741
- You don't like poetry?
- I love poetry.

445
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:30,247
I just thought that was Willard Scott.
I was confused.

446
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:33,044
Do you think I'm acting like this
because I'm egocentric?

447
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:36,416
I know you're egocentric.
It's your defining characteristic.

448
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:42,217
Are you guys ready? We better get going
to stay ahead of the weather.

449
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:46,057
Thanks, Larry.
Would you like a doggie bag?

450
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:50,066
- I'll stay here and finish.
- I thought you hated this town.

451
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:53,228
It's beginning to grow on me.

452
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:54,895
Larry, quit staring.

453
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:56,599
These are excellent.

454
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:11,952
Did you see the groundhog
this morning?

455
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:14,457
I never miss it.

456
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,459
What's your name?

457
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:20,092
Nancy Taylor.
And you are?

458
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:22,962
- What high school did you go to?
- What?

459
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,630
- High school.
- Lincoln, in Pittsburgh.

460
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:31,641
- Who are you?
- Who was your senior English teacher?

461
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,973
Are you kidding?

462
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:37,811
- Your 12th-grade English teacher was...
- Mrs. Walsh.

463
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:42,649
Nancy. Lincoln. Walsh.
Thanks very much.

464
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,669
Lincoln High School.

465
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:09,508
I sat next to you
in Mrs. Walsh's English class.

466
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,514
I'm sorry.

467
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:17,645
- That's amazing.
- You don't remember me, do you?

468
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,886
I even asked you to the prom.

469
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,725
I was short,
and I've sprouted.

470
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:33,870
Gosh! How are you?

471
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,606
Great.
You look terrific.

472
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:40,166
You look very terrific.

473
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:46,007
- I have to do this report.
- Are you a reporter?

474
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:49,018
I'm a weatherman
with Channel 9 Pittsburgh.

475
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:51,281
I should have known.
That's great!

476
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,152
Maybe later we could...

477
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,714
Whatever.

478
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:58,023
Stay right here.
Promise me?

479
00:39:58,095 --> 00:40:00,563
I'll be right back.
Wish me luck.

480
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:02,030
Good luck!

481
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:29,216
Who's Rita?

482
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:31,227
How should I know?

483
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:34,059
Is this some kind
of one-night stand?

484
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:37,066
On the contrary, Nancy.
I love you.

485
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:40,228
I've always loved you.

486
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:44,240
This is gonna seem sudden, but...

487
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:47,243
Nancy, will you be my wife?

488
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,953
Whatever.

489
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:04,260
A gust of wind.

490
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,963
A dog barks.

491
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:10,966
Cue the truck.

492
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,909
Exit Herman.

493
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,639
Walk into the bank.

494
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:26,774
Exit Felix. Stand there with
a not-so-bright look on your face.

495
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,710
All right, Doris, come on.

496
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:34,246
Fix your bra, honey.
That's better.

497
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:38,261
"Felix."
"How you doing, Doris?"

498
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,992
"Can I have a roll of quarters?"

499
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:47,493
Ten, nine, eight...

500
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:52,235
Car. Six, five...

501
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,641
Quarters.

502
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,236
Three...

503
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:57,837
two...

504
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,692
- What?
- Did I bring out two bags or one?

505
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,819
I don't know.

506
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:41,349
I thought we were going
to a costume party.

507
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:44,519
It's like I said,
I love this film.

508
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:46,721
I've seen it
over a hundred times.

509
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:52,201
I told you to call me Bronco.

510
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:53,896
Sorry, Bronco.

511
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:05,381
My old fiance.
They never remember me.

512
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:13,589
- That will be one adult and...
- Two adults.

513
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:27,827
<i>The question we have to ask ourselves</i>
<i>today is, "Does Phil feel lucky?"</i>

514
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:32,774
Rita, if you only had one day to live,
what would you do with it?

515
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:35,573
I don't know, Phil.
What are you dying of?

516
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:41,413
I mean, the whole world
is about to explode. What do you do?

517
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:44,079
I want to know
where to put the camera.

518
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:46,782
Are you looking
for a date for the weekend?

519
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:49,951
I'm just interested in you.

520
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:54,431
What do you want? What do you like?
What do you think about?

521
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:56,966
What kind of men
are you interested in?

522
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:59,435
What do you do for fun?

523
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:02,961
Is this for real or are you trying
to make me look like a fool?

524
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:07,273
I'm just trying to talk like normal
people talk. Isn't this how they talk?

525
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:09,972
- Close.
- So talk to me.

526
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:12,107
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

527
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:17,483
- And a donut.
- All right.

528
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:21,616
What do you want
out of life?

529
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:25,995
I guess I want
what everybody wants:

530
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:29,557
Career, love, marriage, children.

531
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,430
Are you seeing anyone?

532
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,993
I think this is
getting too personal.

533
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:36,598
I don't think I'm ready
to share this with you.

534
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:40,005
How about you?
What do you want?

535
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:44,638
What I really want
is someone like you.

536
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:47,148
- Please.
- Why not?

537
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:50,015
What are you looking for?
Who is your perfect guy?

538
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:55,324
First of all, he's too humble
to know he's perfect.

539
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,318
That's me.

540
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:01,853
He's intelligent,
supportive, funny.

541
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:07,802
Me, me, me.

542
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:12,308
- He's romantic and courageous.
- Me also.

543
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:16,472
He's got a good body, but doesn't look
in the mirror every two minutes.

544
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:22,008
I have a great body, and sometimes
I go months without looking.

545
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:28,016
He's kind, sensitive and gentle.

546
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,526
He's not afraid to cry
in front of me.

547
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:33,188
This is a man, right?

548
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:38,530
He likes animals and children,
and he'll change poopy diapers.

549
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:41,036
Does he have
to use the word "poopy"?

550
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:46,042
And he plays an instrument,
and he loves his mother.

551
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:50,542
I am really close on this one.

552
00:45:57,988 --> 00:45:59,717
It's Phil Connors.

553
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:02,758
Hello.
Thanks for watching.

554
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,405
So, what are the chances
of getting out today?

555
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:21,944
The van still won't start.
Larry's working on it.

556
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:25,573
Wouldn't you know it.
Can I buy you a drink?

557
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:30,851
Jim Beam, ice, water.

558
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:32,786
For you, miss?

559
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:36,417
Sweet vermouth on the rocks
with a twist, please.

560
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:44,265
What are the chances
of getting out of town today?

561
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:46,962
The van still won't start.
Larry's working on it.

562
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:51,100
Wouldn't you know it.
Can I buy you a drink?

563
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:56,345
Sweet vermouth,
rocks with a twist, please.

564
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:59,974
- For you, miss?
- The same.

565
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:03,976
- That's my favorite drink.
- Mine too.

566
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:08,981
It always makes me think of Rome,
the way the sun hits the buildings.

567
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:12,787
What shall we drink to?

568
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:16,124
To the groundhog.

569
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,464
I always drink to world peace.

570
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:29,638
Can I buy you a drink?

571
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:35,708
Sweet vermouth,
rocks with a twist, please.

572
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:38,152
For you, miss?

573
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:42,318
The same.
That's my favorite drink.

574
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:45,020
Mine too.

575
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:47,496
It always makes me think of Rome...

576
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:52,331
the way the sun hits the buildings.

577
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:54,495
What shall we drink to?

578
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,505
I like to say a prayer
and drink to world peace.

579
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:04,346
To world peace.

580
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:09,242
Amen.

581
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:16,881
- This is wonderful.
- Didn't I tell you?

582
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,019
How do you know so much
about Punxsutawney?

583
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:21,690
I've spent a lot of time here.

584
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:25,201
- Small town people are more real.
- That's how I feel.

585
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,703
Really?
Would you like some white chocolate?

586
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:31,366
- Don't make me sick.
- No white chocolate.

587
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:34,535
There is something familiar
about this.

588
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:38,877
- Do you ever have deja vu?
- Didn't you just ask me that?

589
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:46,717
People place too much emphasis
on their careers.

590
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:50,385
I wish we could all live
in the mountains at high altitude.

591
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,928
That's where I see myself
in five years.

592
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:55,396
- How about you?
- I agree.

593
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:59,561
I like to go with the flow,
see where it leads me.

594
00:48:59,636 --> 00:49:01,570
It's led you here.

595
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:07,073
It's a million miles
from where I started in college.

596
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:09,908
You weren't in broadcasting
or journalism?

597
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:16,085
Believe it or not, I studied
19th-century French poetry.

598
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:17,916
What a waste of time.

599
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:21,081
For someone else that would be
an incredible waste of time.

600
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:24,093
It was so bold of you to choose that.
It's incredible.

601
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:27,619
You must be a very strong person.

602
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:32,596
People place too much emphasis
on their careers.

603
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:37,436
I wish we could all live
in the mountains, at high altitudes.

604
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,771
That's where I see myself
in five years.

605
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:41,777
- How about you?
- I agree.

606
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:45,110
I like to go with the flow,
see what happens.

607
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:47,946
It's gotten you here.

608
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:51,112
It's a million miles
from where I started in college.

609
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:54,282
You weren't in broadcasting
or journalism?

610
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:59,952
Believe it or not, I studied
19th-century French poetry.

611
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,547
You speak French.

612
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:27,356
- I haven't done this since I was a kid.
- Me neither.

613
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:30,416
- It's fun.
- It's good, clean fun.

614
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:37,199
I hope that one day I can do this
with my own children.

615
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,534
Where did you get that?

616
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:45,370
I went over to the snowman shop.

617
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:48,771
An assassin!

618
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:50,813
I'll protect you,
Your Majesty.

619
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:54,009
I shall die for you!
You shall not take her!

620
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:55,550
Find cover, my lady!

621
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:58,887
- Nice arm.
- I'm getting some good ones.

622
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:01,890
There's a boy.
That's a boy. Good try.

623
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:03,949
- Got him.
- Help me.

624
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:06,781
- What?
- I'm amazed, and I'm not easily amazed.

625
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:09,451
- About what?
- How you can start a day...

626
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:13,792
with one kind of expectation
and end up so completely different.

627
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:18,297
Do you like the way
this day is turning out?

628
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:20,962
I like it very much.

629
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:24,633
It's a perfect day.
You couldn't plan a day like this.

630
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:29,304
You can.
It just takes an awful lot of work.

631
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:31,813
Come on in.
I want to show you something.

632
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:34,316
- I don't think I should.
- I don't think you should either.

633
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:38,320
That's why I'll show you one thing
and kick you out. Just one minute.

634
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:49,127
It's just lovely.

635
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:03,512
Would you like to sit and stare
at the fake fire?

636
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,518
It's really a wonderful room.

637
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:11,144
It is now.

638
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:20,855
I don't know.
I don't think we should do this.

639
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:22,364
I don't either.

640
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:28,362
On second thought,
I think we should.

641
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:31,532
It's the perfect end
to a perfect day.

642
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:35,703
It's a little fast for me.

643
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:37,542
Me too.

644
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:39,878
Maybe I should go.

645
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:42,180
Where would you go?

646
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:46,381
Why?
We've got a perfect fire.

647
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:49,186
I've got some French poetry here.
Baudelaire.

648
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:52,553
I will read to you.

649
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:55,723
I've got ice cream
on the windowsill.

650
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:57,733
Hold on a minute.

651
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:06,041
- Rocky Road?
- I love Rocky Road.

652
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:08,407
I thought so.

653
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:10,036
You have to stay.

654
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:14,413
I'm tired.
We can see each other tomorrow.

655
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:18,215
Tonight.
It's gotta be tonight.

656
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:23,259
- Really.
- Just stay for awhile.

657
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:27,922
If you like it, stay for a while longer
and awhile longer.

658
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:32,594
- Let's not spoil it.
- I don't want to spoil it either.

659
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:35,763
You know I can't stay with you.

660
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:38,933
Why not? I love you.

661
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:43,070
You love me?

662
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:47,913
- You don't even know me.
- I know you.

663
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:52,083
I can't believe I fell for this.

664
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:54,783
This whole day has just been
one long setup.

665
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:58,851
- It hasn't.
- And I hate fudge.

666
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:01,158
No white chocolate.
No fudge.

667
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:05,099
What are you doing?
Are you making some kind of list?

668
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:08,797
Did you call my friends and ask
what I like and what I don't like?

669
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:12,467
- Is this what love is for you?
- This is real. This is love.

670
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:16,273
Stop saying that!
You must be crazy.

671
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:20,110
I could never love someone like you.
You only love yourself.

672
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:24,244
That's not true. I don't even like
myself. Give me another chance.

673
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:28,119
That's for making me care about you.

674
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:38,126
- I haven't done this since I was a kid.
- Me neither.

675
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:40,999
- It's fun.
- Good, clean fun too.

676
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:43,835
That's what's missing
in the world today.

677
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:46,501
I can't wait to do this
with my own children.

678
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:48,669
Golly, I want lots of kids!

679
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:50,679
I want to adopt.
I want to have my own.

680
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:54,308
I want foster kids.
I got this at Snowman City.

681
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:58,220
Some kid threw
a snowball at us!

682
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:01,223
Come here!
Let's have some fun!

683
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,221
I wish these were my own kids!

684
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:11,525
Are any of you up for adoption?

685
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:15,427
Here's a humdinger over here!
Wasn't that great?

686
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,012
Stop it!

687
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:14,061
Over here!

688
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:18,828
Where have you been?
You're missing all the fun.

689
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:20,927
You look terrible.

690
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:24,064
What happened?
Rough night?

691
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:46,418
Okay, campers, rise and shine.

692
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:51,429
Don't forget your booties
because it's cold out there today.

693
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,699
It's cold out there every day.

694
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:59,731
<i>This country's largest lake, Chapala,</i>
<i>is located near the city...</i>

695
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,970
- <i>of Guadalajara.</i>
- What is Mexico?

696
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:05,645
- <i>Correct.</i>
- <i>"Lakes and Rivers," 400.</i>

697
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:09,014
<i>Seneca is the largest of these lakes</i>
<i>in West-Central New York.</i>

698
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:11,610
- What are the Finger Lakes?
- <i>Correct.</i>

699
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:13,622
- That's amazing.
- <i>"Lakes and Rivers" for 600.</i>

700
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:16,215
<i>This South American lake drains</i>
<i>into the smaller lake in Bolivia.</i>

701
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:20,023
- What is Titicaca?
- <i>Correct.</i>

702
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:22,496
- <i>"Lakes and Rivers" for 1,000.</i>
- <i>Milky colored...</i>

703
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:23,998
- <i>from glacial clay...</i>
- What is the Rhone?

704
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:27,992
<i>When entering Lake Geneva,</i>
<i>this river is clear upon exiting.</i>

705
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:30,835
<i>Jim?</i>
<i>The Rhone is good for $ 1,000.</i>

706
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:35,742
- <i>You are $500 off the lead.</i>
- <i>Let's go to "Inventors" for 200.</i>

707
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:38,076
This is pitiful.

708
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:42,914
A thousand people freezing their butts
off, waiting to worship a rat.

709
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:46,649
What a hype. Groundhog Day used
to mean something in this town.

710
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:49,317
They used to pull the hog out
and eat it!

711
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:52,486
You're hypocrites, all of you!

712
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:57,995
You got a problem
with what I'm saying?

713
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,832
Untie your tongue,
and you come out here and talk.

714
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:02,872
Am I upsetting you, Princess?

715
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:07,967
You want a prediction about the weather,
you're asking the wrong Phil.

716
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:10,946
I'll give you a winter prediction.

717
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:13,278
It's gonna be cold...

718
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:15,510
it's gonna be gray...

719
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:20,783
and it's gonna last you
for the rest of your life.

720
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:59,394
Once again, the eyes of the nation
have turned here to this...

721
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:01,760
tiny village
in western Pennsylvania.

722
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:06,058
There is no way that
this winter...

723
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:09,161
is ever going to end...

724
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:13,197
as long as this groundhog
keeps seeing his shadow.

725
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,301
I don't see any other way out.

726
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:18,113
He has to be stopped.

727
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:20,907
I have to stop him.

728
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:25,217
Real good, Phil.

729
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:28,950
He's crazy.

730
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:36,862
I'm worried. I think there's something
really wrong with Phil.

731
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:39,527
There's a lot of things
really wrong with Phil.

732
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:46,004
I've come to the end of me.

733
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:49,442
There's no way out now.

734
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:52,970
I just want you to remember
we had a beautiful day together once.

735
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:59,846
All right, little fella.
Good job.

736
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:02,516
- He smiled at me. Did you see that?
- I believe he did.

737
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,321
Okay, little fella.
There you go.

738
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:11,298
Hi, mister.
Something I can do you for?

739
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:15,904
What are you doing?

740
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:22,737
Jake, get the word out!
Somebody kidnapped Phil!

741
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:24,370
We're going after him!

742
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:33,913
Why would anybody steal a groundhog?

743
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:36,982
I can probably think
of a couple of reasons. Pervert.

744
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:06,312
- He must have just snapped!
- This should be good.

745
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:11,726
What is he doing?
What can he be thinking?

746
01:02:11,794 --> 01:02:14,194
That's not bad
for a quadruped.

747
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:18,097
You gotta check your mirrors,
just the side of your eye.

748
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,803
That's it.

749
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,469
They're chasing us!
Come on, make it fun!

750
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:39,784
Don't drive angry.

751
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:04,372
Hot dog! There's no way out except
the way we came in. We got him now!

752
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:26,130
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.

753
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:33,265
If you gotta shoot, aim high.
I don't wanna hit the groundhog.

754
01:03:37,613 --> 01:03:39,843
We mustn't keep
our public waiting.

755
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:44,486
It's show time.

756
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,194
All right, on me, Larry,
in three!

757
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:58,191
Two, one.

758
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:16,518
He might be okay.

759
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:23,715
Probably not now.

760
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:41,467
Nuts.

761
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:51,884
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

762
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:55,549
Would you like some toast?

763
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:17,003
- What's going on?
- My God.

764
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:50,711
That's him.

765
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:57,379
He was a really great guy.

766
01:05:57,453 --> 01:06:00,286
I really liked him a lot.

767
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:07,897
I'm sorry.
What was that again?

768
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:10,024
I'm sorry.
What was that again?

769
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:13,160
- I'm a god!
- You're a god?

770
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:16,602
I'm a god.
I'm not the God, I don't think.

771
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:19,266
Because you survived a car wreck?

772
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:20,934
You ready to order?

773
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:24,173
I didn't just survive a wreck.
I wasn't just blown up yesterday.

774
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:27,113
I have been stabbed,
shot, poisoned...

775
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:30,118
frozen, hung, electrocuted...

776
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:32,450
- and burned.
- Really?

777
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:37,288
Every morning I wake up fine,
not a dent in the fender.

778
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:41,319
- I am an immortal.
- Special today is blueberry waffles.

779
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:43,388
Why are you telling me this?

780
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:45,798
Because I want you
to believe in me.

781
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:50,965
You're not a god. Believe me. This is
12 years of Catholic school talking.

782
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,474
I could come back
if you're not ready.

783
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:55,840
How do you know I'm not a god?

784
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:59,745
Please!
Because it's not possible!

785
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:02,875
- I'll come back.
- Doris!

786
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:09,520
This is Doris. Her brother-in-law,
Carl, owns this diner.

787
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:14,154
She's worked here since she was 17.
She wants to see Paris before she dies.

788
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:16,630
- Boy, would I!
- What are you doing?

789
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:20,260
- Debbie Kleiser and her fiance, Fred.
- Do I know you?

790
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:23,464
They're supposed to be married this
afternoon, but Debbie is reconsidering.

791
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:26,508
- What?
- Lovely ring.

792
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:28,770
This is Bill who's been a waiter
for three years...

793
01:07:28,844 --> 01:07:31,335
since he left Penn State
and had to get work.

794
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:34,247
He likes the town, paints toy soldiers,
and he's gay.

795
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:36,181
I am.

796
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:39,346
This is Gus. He hates his life here
and wishes he'd stayed in the Navy.

797
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:42,084
I could have retired on half pay
after 20 years.

798
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:44,217
Is this some kind of trick?

799
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:47,194
Maybe the real God uses tricks.
Maybe He's not omnipotent.

800
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:50,391
He's just been around so long,
He knows everything.

801
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:51,899
- Who's that?
- This is Tom.

802
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:54,197
He worked in the coal mine
till they closed it down.

803
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:55,703
- Her?
- Alice.

804
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:58,399
She came from Ireland as a baby
and lived in Erie most of her life.

805
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:00,601
- He's right.
- Nancy.

806
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:05,409
She works in the dress shop and makes
chipmunk noises when she gets excited.

807
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:07,415
- It's true.
- How do you know these people?

808
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:12,284
I know everything. In five seconds,
a waiter will drop a tray of dishes.

809
01:08:12,354 --> 01:08:15,152
- Five, four, three, two, one.
- This is nuts.

810
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,360
That's enough.

811
01:08:20,996 --> 01:08:24,796
- Do you know me too?
- I know all about you.

812
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:27,665
You like producing, but you're hoping
for more than Channel 9 Pittsburgh.

813
01:08:27,736 --> 01:08:30,261
Everyone knows that.

814
01:08:30,339 --> 01:08:33,604
You like boats, but not the ocean.

815
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:37,237
You go to a mountain lake in the summer
with your family.

816
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:39,338
There's a long, wooden dock
and a boathouse...

817
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:41,440
with boards missing
from the roof...

818
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:44,850
and a place you used to crawl
underneath to be alone.

819
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:49,289
You're a sucker for French poetry
and rhinestones.

820
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:51,087
You're very generous.

821
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:54,026
You're kind to strangers
and children.

822
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,963
And when you stand in the snow,
you look like an angel.

823
01:08:56,999 --> 01:08:58,967
How are you doing this?

824
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:04,972
I wake up every day right here...

825
01:09:05,007 --> 01:09:08,534
in Punxsutawney,
and it's always February 2.

826
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:12,012
There's nothing
I can do about it.

827
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:16,010
If you still doubt me...

828
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:18,576
in ten seconds...

829
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:22,351
Larry will come through that door
and take you away from me...

830
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:25,120
but you can't let him.

831
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:28,196
Please believe me.
You've got to believe me.

832
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:37,305
You ready? We better get going if we're
going to stay ahead of the weather.

833
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:39,637
What's that?

834
01:09:48,117 --> 01:09:50,051
Maybe it really is happening.

835
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:52,246
How else could you know so much?

836
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:54,812
There is no way.
I'm not that smart.

837
01:09:55,991 --> 01:09:58,425
Maybe I should spend the day
with you...

838
01:09:58,494 --> 01:10:02,021
as an objective witness,
just to see what happens.

839
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:04,828
This sounds
like a science project.

840
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:08,497
Concentrate.
You gotta want it.

841
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:15,872
It's more in the wrist than the finger.
It's just gotta...

842
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:26,087
Be the hat! Come on! Go!

843
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:28,089
It would take me a year
to get good at this.

844
01:10:28,157 --> 01:10:32,719
Six months. Four to five hours a day,
and you'd be an expert.

845
01:10:32,795 --> 01:10:35,127
Is this what you do
with eternity?

846
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,858
Now you know.

847
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:40,258
That's not the worst part.

848
01:10:40,336 --> 01:10:42,270
What's the worst part?

849
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:47,105
The worst part is that tomorrow you
will have forgotten all about this...

850
01:10:47,176 --> 01:10:50,407
and you'll treat me
like a jerk again.

851
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:54,040
- It's all right. I am a jerk.
- You're not.

852
01:10:54,116 --> 01:10:56,175
It doesn't make any difference.

853
01:10:56,285 --> 01:11:00,915
I've killed myself so many times,
I don't even exist anymore.

854
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:04,323
Sometimes I wish
I had a thousand lifetimes.

855
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:08,022
I don't know, Phil.
Maybe it's not a curse.

856
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:10,623
It just depends on
how you look at it.

857
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:14,596
Gosh, you're an upbeat lady!

858
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:22,334
- It's been a really nice day for me.
- Me too.

859
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:27,439
Maybe, if it's not too boring,
we could do it again sometime.

860
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:29,450
I hope so.

861
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:42,955
You're still here.

862
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:48,502
I thought you were supposed
to disappear or I was or something!

863
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:51,038
Not until 6:00.

864
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:52,767
You rat!

865
01:11:52,841 --> 01:11:54,570
I never said midnight.

866
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:59,603
- You knew I was waiting for midnight!
- Does this mean you're gonna leave?

867
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:04,519
Good.

868
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:16,664
I'm sorry.

869
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:21,597
It's all right.
You can fall asleep.

870
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:26,004
I promise
I won't touch you, much.

871
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:30,678
That's all right.
I'm not tired.

872
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:32,771
What were you saying?

873
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:37,315
I think the last thing
that you heard was...

874
01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:39,944
"Only God can make a tree."

875
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:41,455
Really?

876
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:21,662
What I wanted to say was...

877
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:29,035
I think you're the kindest, sweetest,
prettiest person...

878
01:13:29,104 --> 01:13:31,197
I've ever met in my life.

879
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:35,438
I've never seen anyone...

880
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:37,911
that's nicer to people
than you are.

881
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:53,993
The first time I saw you...

882
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:57,589
something happened to me.

883
01:13:57,666 --> 01:14:00,066
I never told you, but...

884
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:07,767
I knew that I wanted
to hold you as hard as I could.

885
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:23,785
I don't deserve someone like you.

886
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:30,160
But if I ever could...

887
01:14:30,232 --> 01:14:32,598
I swear I would love you...

888
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:34,795
for the rest of my life.

889
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:41,433
Did you say something?

890
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:48,381
Good night.

891
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:03,389
Who wants coffee?
Get it while it's hot.

892
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:05,221
Thanks, Phil.

893
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:10,322
- Larry? Skim milk, two sugars.
- Thanks, Phil.

894
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:12,993
- Pastry?
- We're just setting up.

895
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:14,969
Take your pick.

896
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:18,263
Thanks. Raspberry. Great.

897
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:21,901
I was just talking with Buster Green,
the head groundhog honcho.

898
01:16:21,977 --> 01:16:24,969
He said if we set up over here,
we might get a better shot.

899
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:27,709
- What do you think?
- Sounds good.

900
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:29,216
What do you think?

901
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:32,453
Let's go for it.

902
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:35,513
- Good work.
- Maybe we'll get lucky.

903
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:37,524
Let me help you
with the heavy stuff.

904
01:16:39,294 --> 01:16:42,229
You got your coffee.
I'll get it.

905
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:45,266
We never talk.
Do you have kids?

906
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:21,936
I'd like a piano lesson, please.

907
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:26,407
I'm with a student now. If you come
back tomorrow, I can squeeze you in.

908
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:29,672
I kind of want to get started.
I could give you $1,000.

909
01:17:31,913 --> 01:17:33,312
Come on in.

910
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:55,128
Good morning!
Off to see the groundhog?

911
01:17:58,273 --> 01:18:00,833
You think it will be
an early spring?

912
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:03,400
"Winter slumbering in the open air...

913
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:05,412
wears on his smiling face...

914
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,448
a dream of spring."

915
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:50,991
How's she look?

916
01:18:51,026 --> 01:18:53,586
- Great.
- Thank you.

917
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:55,630
Did you know
he could ice sculpt?

918
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:14,507
Not bad.
You say this is your first lesson?

919
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:18,180
My father was a piano mover.

920
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,921
I thought it was you.

921
01:19:30,832 --> 01:19:33,426
I have missed you so much.

922
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:41,341
I don't know where you're headed,
but can you call in sick?

923
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:47,442
I gotta get going.

924
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:49,575
It's good to see you.

925
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:09,864
Hello, father.

926
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:13,396
Let's get you someplace warm.

927
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:14,942
Remember me?

928
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:23,108
Excuse me, sir. Are you the one
who brought the old man in?

929
01:20:23,185 --> 01:20:25,176
How is he?

930
01:20:25,253 --> 01:20:27,619
He just passed away.

931
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:30,824
What did he die of?

932
01:20:30,892 --> 01:20:34,123
He was just old.
It was just his time.

933
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:39,991
- I want to see his chart. Excuse me.
- Sir!

934
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:42,229
You can't come in here.

935
01:20:42,304 --> 01:20:45,000
This is a restricted area.

936
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:56,210
Where's the chart?

937
01:20:56,284 --> 01:20:59,481
Sometimes people just die.

938
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:01,488
Not today.

939
01:21:13,335 --> 01:21:15,269
It's hard down there
at the bottom.

940
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:21,168
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

941
01:21:25,513 --> 01:21:27,504
Come on, Dad!
Come on, Pop!

942
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:34,181
Breathe, Pop!

943
01:22:00,715 --> 01:22:03,309
When Chekhov
saw the long winter...

944
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:07,287
he saw a winter bleak and dark
and bereft of hope.

945
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:12,292
Yet we know that winter is just
another step in the cycle of life.

946
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:16,228
But standing here
among the people of Punxsutawney...

947
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:19,028
and basking in the warmth
of their hearths and hearts...

948
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:22,399
I couldn't imagine a better fate...

949
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:25,735
than a long and lustrous winter.

950
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:28,799
From Punxsutawney,
it's Phil Connors.

951
01:22:28,877 --> 01:22:30,310
So long.

952
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:33,981
Very nice speech, Phil.

953
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:36,347
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

954
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:39,649
- How was that for you two?
- Man, you touched me.

955
01:22:39,721 --> 01:22:41,655
- Thanks, Larry.
- Thank you.

956
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:45,455
I gotta go.

957
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:49,725
That was surprising.
I didn't know you were so versatile.

958
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:51,732
I surprise myself sometimes.

959
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,859
Would you like
to get some coffee?

960
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:57,928
I'd love to. Can I have a rain check?
I've got some errands to run.

961
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:05,545
What errands?
I thought we were going back.

962
01:23:15,223 --> 01:23:17,020
Hold it, fella!

963
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:26,665
What do you say?

964
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:30,171
You little brat.
You have never thanked me!

965
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:33,503
I'll see you tomorrow, maybe!

966
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:43,345
- Now what?
- You've totaled it.

967
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:48,515
It's only a flat tire.
Now just be patient. Just cool it!

968
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:52,492
- It's an earthquake!
- It's not an earthquake!

969
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,993
What is it?

970
01:23:57,265 --> 01:23:59,358
Thank you, young man.

971
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:02,993
It's nothing.
I had the tire and the jack.

972
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:05,767
Just be comfortable.
Be a minute.

973
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,364
Who is that?

974
01:24:07,442 --> 01:24:10,206
Must be from the motor club.

975
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:14,409
- My God! He's having a heart attack!
- What should I do?

976
01:24:14,482 --> 01:24:17,883
- Call an ambulance, a lawyer, a doctor!
- Mom, I don't think he's breathing!

977
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:27,761
I think that did it.

978
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:34,134
If you're gonna eat steak,
get some sharper teeth.

979
01:24:34,202 --> 01:24:36,898
- Enjoy your lunch.
- Thank you.

980
01:24:36,971 --> 01:24:39,701
Who was that? I'm fine.

981
01:24:39,774 --> 01:24:42,572
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yes. Eat.

982
01:24:46,981 --> 01:24:49,643
<i>People just don't understand</i>
<i>what is involved in this.</i>

983
01:24:49,717 --> 01:24:51,651
This is an art form.

984
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:54,449
You know, I think most people
just think that...

985
01:24:54,522 --> 01:24:57,685
I hold the camera
and point it at stuff.

986
01:24:57,759 --> 01:25:00,227
There is a lot more to it
than just that.

987
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:05,429
Would you be at all interested
in seeing the inside of the van?

988
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:09,402
You know, I really have to get back
to the party.

989
01:25:09,471 --> 01:25:13,430
Great idea. I'll go with you.
Let me just drop a tip here.

990
01:25:20,548 --> 01:25:23,415
How are you?
Rita, this is Nancy.

991
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:25,919
We were just going
to the party.

992
01:25:25,987 --> 01:25:27,921
- You going?
- Sounds like fun.

993
01:25:27,989 --> 01:25:30,583
Maybe we should call Phil.

994
01:25:30,658 --> 01:25:32,717
- I think he's already in there.
- Great.

995
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:32,208
- Isn't he good?
- He's great!

996
01:27:32,313 --> 01:27:34,247
He's my student.

997
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:38,485
I'm so proud.

998
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:41,020
Thank you.

999
01:27:42,023 --> 01:27:44,082
Welcome to our party.

1000
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:47,958
- I didn't know you could play like that.
- I'm versatile.

1001
01:27:55,903 --> 01:27:58,929
It's that nice, young man
from the motor club.

1002
01:27:59,007 --> 01:28:02,306
- Thank you again.
- It's nothing, ladies.

1003
01:28:02,377 --> 01:28:05,778
He's the fastest jack
in Jefferson County.

1004
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:10,050
What was that all about?

1005
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:13,144
I really don't know.
They've been hitting on me all night.

1006
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:15,489
There you are.

1007
01:28:17,358 --> 01:28:20,759
I never thanked you properly
for what you did for Buster.

1008
01:28:20,828 --> 01:28:23,160
He would have choked for sure.

1009
01:28:23,231 --> 01:28:27,065
He may have.
He was trying to swallow a whole cow.

1010
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:31,231
- I owe you one, buddy.
- Hang onto him, dear. He's a real find.

1011
01:28:34,108 --> 01:28:37,669
- What did you do today?
- Same old, same old.

1012
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:45,013
Excuse me.

1013
01:28:45,086 --> 01:28:47,020
Fred, how was the wedding?

1014
01:28:47,088 --> 01:28:50,285
I just wanted to thank you
for making Debbie go through with it.

1015
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:53,554
All I did was fan the flame
of her passion for you.

1016
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:56,188
You are the best.

1017
01:28:56,264 --> 01:28:59,529
Rita,
this is Debbie and Fred Kleiser.

1018
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,865
- Here you go, kids. Congratulations.
- What is this?

1019
01:29:02,937 --> 01:29:06,031
No way!

1020
01:29:06,107 --> 01:29:07,574
Wrestlemania!

1021
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:13,204
How did you know?
We're gonna be in Pittsburgh anyway!

1022
01:29:13,281 --> 01:29:17,149
- Thank you! You're a real pal!
- This is the best!

1023
01:29:22,156 --> 01:29:25,956
- I don't understand.
- I guess not.

1024
01:29:25,993 --> 01:29:28,484
How does everyone know you?
You only come here once a year.

1025
01:29:28,563 --> 01:29:31,088
You seem like the most popular person
in town.

1026
01:29:31,165 --> 01:29:33,531
Excuse me. Dr. Connors?

1027
01:29:33,601 --> 01:29:36,399
I want to thank you
for fixing Felix's back.

1028
01:29:36,471 --> 01:29:38,837
He can even help
around the house again.

1029
01:29:38,906 --> 01:29:41,374
I'm sorry to hear that, Felix.

1030
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:45,812
"Dr. Connors"?

1031
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,440
It's kind of an honorary title.

1032
01:29:48,516 --> 01:29:51,280
- What is going on?
- I really don't know.

1033
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:54,617
There is something
going on with you.

1034
01:29:54,689 --> 01:29:56,782
Would you like the long version
or the short one?

1035
01:29:56,858 --> 01:29:59,622
Let's start with the short
and go from there.

1036
01:30:05,333 --> 01:30:08,097
Okay, folks. Attention.

1037
01:30:08,169 --> 01:30:11,536
Time for the big bachelor auction.
You all know the rules.

1038
01:30:11,606 --> 01:30:14,040
All the eligible bachelors
come down in front...

1039
01:30:14,108 --> 01:30:17,373
and you ladies bid on them!

1040
01:30:17,478 --> 01:30:21,539
You get to do whatever you want
with them. No questions asked!

1041
01:30:21,616 --> 01:30:24,881
I don't want to know about it,
as long as it's legal!

1042
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:28,752
Get out your pocketbooks and remember,
it's all for charity!

1043
01:30:31,692 --> 01:30:34,991
What are you doing down here?
Go on. Get up there.

1044
01:30:35,029 --> 01:30:38,556
I got ten bucks that
says you're mine!

1045
01:30:38,633 --> 01:30:42,091
- Buster, I got your first victim.
- Come up here!

1046
01:30:48,509 --> 01:30:51,876
All right! What am I bid
for this fine specimen?

1047
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:53,573
Five dollars!

1048
01:30:53,648 --> 01:30:55,741
The bidding has begun
at five dollars.

1049
01:30:55,817 --> 01:30:58,718
- Ten dollars!
- Fifteen!

1050
01:30:58,786 --> 01:31:00,913
- Twenty!
- Twenty-five!

1051
01:31:00,988 --> 01:31:03,149
- Thirty!
- Thirty-five!

1052
01:31:03,224 --> 01:31:05,249
- Forty!
- Forty-five!

1053
01:31:05,326 --> 01:31:08,193
- Fifty!
- Fifty-five!

1054
01:31:08,262 --> 01:31:11,254
- Sixty!
- I'm bid sixty. Do I hear more?

1055
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:18,333
Three hundred and thirty-nine dollars
and eighty-eight cents!

1056
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:26,170
We can't accept any more bids.
That's sold...

1057
01:31:26,247 --> 01:31:29,944
to the little lady for $339.88!

1058
01:31:31,018 --> 01:31:32,417
Congratulations.

1059
01:31:40,528 --> 01:31:42,428
Okay, bachelors!
Who's next?

1060
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:56,136
All right!
What am I bid for this guy?

1061
01:31:56,210 --> 01:31:58,201
Do I hear a buck and a half?

1062
01:31:58,279 --> 01:32:00,577
Anybody?

1063
01:32:00,648 --> 01:32:03,674
- Seventy-five cents?
- I bid two bits!

1064
01:32:03,751 --> 01:32:06,686
Sold to the lady
for twenty-five cents!

1065
01:32:06,754 --> 01:32:08,346
I got him!

1066
01:32:16,764 --> 01:32:19,426
Phil Connors!
I thought that was you!

1067
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:22,230
This is Ned Ryerson,
my new insurance agent.

1068
01:32:22,303 --> 01:32:23,770
I'll say!

1069
01:32:24,839 --> 01:32:26,932
I have not seen this guy
for 20 years.

1070
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:29,977
He comes to me and buys whole life,
term, uniflex...

1071
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:32,036
fire, theft, auto,
dental, health...

1072
01:32:32,113 --> 01:32:35,310
with the optional death
and dismemberment plan, water damage.

1073
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:37,817
This is the best day of my life.

1074
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:40,046
Mine too.

1075
01:32:40,121 --> 01:32:43,352
- Where are we going?
- Let's not spoil it.

1076
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:47,727
I got that!

1077
01:32:50,731 --> 01:32:54,189
- Why can't I look?
- Because you bother me a lot.

1078
01:32:54,268 --> 01:32:57,760
I'm getting cold.
How much longer do I have to sit here?

1079
01:32:57,838 --> 01:33:01,467
I'm just giving you your money's worth.
You paid top dollar for me.

1080
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:04,374
I think you were a bargain.

1081
01:33:04,445 --> 01:33:07,346
Sweet of you to say.
You're probably right.

1082
01:33:10,151 --> 01:33:12,813
- Is it finished yet?
- Almost.

1083
01:33:12,887 --> 01:33:16,721
I still have to put cherry syrup on top
and then we can eat it.

1084
01:33:16,791 --> 01:33:19,453
Come on!
I'm freezing!

1085
01:33:19,527 --> 01:33:22,394
One second. All right.
Let me turn toward the light.

1086
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:30,369
It's amazing.

1087
01:33:31,072 --> 01:33:33,006
It's beautiful.

1088
01:33:36,677 --> 01:33:40,511
- How did you do that?
- I know your face so well...

1089
01:33:40,615 --> 01:33:42,674
I could have done it
with my eyes closed.

1090
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:51,224
It's lovely.
I don't know what to say.

1091
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:53,927
I do.

1092
01:33:55,696 --> 01:33:58,164
No matter what happens tomorrow...

1093
01:33:58,232 --> 01:34:00,257
or for the rest of my life...

1094
01:34:00,334 --> 01:34:04,100
I'm happy now
because I love you.

1095
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,774
I think I'm happy too.

1096
01:35:06,267 --> 01:35:08,895
- <i>Please, not again.</i>
- <i>That is a great song!</i>

1097
01:35:08,969 --> 01:35:10,561
- <i>It's not!</i>
- <i>Don't listen to this man...</i>

1098
01:35:12,773 --> 01:35:15,071
It's too early.

1099
01:35:25,586 --> 01:35:27,986
Something is different.

1100
01:35:28,022 --> 01:35:29,489
Good or bad?

1101
01:35:29,557 --> 01:35:32,048
Anything different is good...

1102
01:35:34,328 --> 01:35:36,489
but this could be real good.

1103
01:35:41,402 --> 01:35:43,336
Why are you here?

1104
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:45,838
I bought you. I own you.

1105
01:35:47,875 --> 01:35:49,809
But why are you still here?

1106
01:35:49,877 --> 01:35:52,539
You said stay, so I stayed.

1107
01:35:55,516 --> 01:35:57,814
I said stay, so you stayed?

1108
01:35:57,885 --> 01:36:00,547
I can't even make a collie stay.

1109
01:36:02,490 --> 01:36:05,288
I gotta check something.

1110
01:36:05,359 --> 01:36:06,826
Stay.

1111
01:36:13,801 --> 01:36:15,200
They're gone!

1112
01:36:16,103 --> 01:36:18,162
They're all gone!

1113
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:22,572
- Do you know what today is?
- What?

1114
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:26,310
Today is tomorrow.

1115
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:28,075
It happened.

1116
01:36:30,017 --> 01:36:32,212
- You're here.
- I'm here.

1117
01:36:36,157 --> 01:36:40,753
Why weren't you like this last night?
You just fell sleep.

1118
01:36:42,963 --> 01:36:45,431
It was the end
of a very long day.

1119
01:36:48,836 --> 01:36:52,431
Is there anything
I can do for you today?

1120
01:36:52,506 --> 01:36:55,873
I'm sure I can think
of something.

1121
01:37:29,243 --> 01:37:31,177
It's so beautiful!

1122
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:43,756
Let's live here.

1123
01:37:53,968 --> 01:37:56,027
We'll rent to start.
