1
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:57,213
Somebody asked me today...

2
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,726
"Phil, if you could be anywhere,
where would you like to be?"

3
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:03,557
I said to him,
"Probably right here."

4
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,894
Elko, Nevada.
Our nation's high at 79 today.

5
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:09,730
In California,
they'll have warm weather tomorrow...

6
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:12,566
gang wars and some
very overpriced real estate.

7
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:17,507
Up in the Pacific Northwest,
they'll have some very tall trees.

8
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,511
It will be clear across
the Rockies and the Great Plains.

9
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,548
But look out,
here comes trouble.

10
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:28,750
Oh, boy!
Front coming our way. Look out.

11
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:30,914
What will that mean to us
in the Three Rivers area?

12
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,721
One of these big blue things!
This cold, frigid, Arctic air.

13
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:36,728
This big mass out of the north.

14
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:40,926
It will meet up with all this moisture
coming out of the Gulf...

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,525
mix together at high altitudes
and cause some snow.

16
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:48,938
It won't hit us here in Pittsburgh.
It will push off and hit Altoona.

17
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,566
Close call.

18
00:01:50,676 --> 00:01:52,769
Let's take a look
at the five-day.

19
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:56,281
Nothing to be too scared about.

20
00:01:56,349 --> 00:02:00,115
Bundle up warm,
but leave your galoshes at home.

21
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:01,949
I won't be here for the 10:00.

22
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:05,286
Tomorrow is Groundhog Day,
and I'm going out to Punxsutawney...

23
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,952
for our country's
oldest groundhog festival.

24
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:11,463
According to the legend,
tomorrow, February 2...

25
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:15,456
if the groundhog sees his shadow,
we'll have six more weeks of winter.

26
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:18,129
- Keep your fingers crossed.
- Sounds like a lot of fun.

27
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:21,970
This is your third year in a row
isn't it?

28
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,474
Four, Nan.

29
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,143
Thanks, Phil.

30
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:30,808
Up next: Diane Kingman looks
at sex and violence in the movies.

31
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:32,316
Stay with us.

32
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:38,349
- We're clear.
- Have fun in Punxsutawney.

33
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,825
For your information, Hairdo...

34
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:44,488
there is a major network
interested in me.

35
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,624
That would be
the Home Shopping Network.

36
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:51,828
Thanks, Larry.
Go wait in the van.

37
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:54,498
That was nice.
"Big trees."

38
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,636
Stop, Henny.
Can you handle the 10:00 or not?

39
00:02:58,744 --> 00:03:02,510
If you don't want to rush back,
I can do the 5:00 tomorrow.

40
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:06,006
I want to stay an extra second
in Punxsutawney? Please!

41
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:10,351
Rita thinks it would be great to stay
for some of the other events...

42
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,118
get some incredible footage.

43
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,853
The people and the fun,
the excitement.

44
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:18,090
You haven't worked with her yet.
She's really nice.

45
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,564
She's gonna be a really good producer.

46
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:24,235
You guys will have fun.

47
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:31,103
She's fun, but not my kind of fun.
I will be here for the 5:00. Rita.

48
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:35,272
Can you keep a secret, Larry?

49
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,775
I'm probably leaving PBH.

50
00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:42,371
So this will be the last time
we do the Groundhog together.

51
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,940
What's wrong
with the Groundhog Festival?

52
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:51,081
In San Diego, I covered the swallows
returning to Capistrano six years.

53
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,751
Someday somebody will see me
interviewing a groundhog...

54
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:55,952
and think I don't have a future.

55
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:58,462
I think it's a nice story.

56
00:04:58,497 --> 00:05:01,295
He comes out,
and he looks around.

57
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:05,303
He wrinkles up his little nose.
He sees his shadow or he doesn't see it.

58
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,601
It's nice. People like it.

59
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:10,608
You are new, aren't you?

60
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:12,735
People like blood sausage too.

61
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,506
People are morons.

62
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,775
Nice attitude.

63
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:21,319
Look in the mirror and see what you
look like doing that groundhog thing.

64
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:22,820
For me? Once?

65
00:05:22,888 --> 00:05:26,984
He comes out
and looks at his little shadow.

66
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:32,193
- Would you like some blood sausage?
- I like blood sausage.

67
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,687
Rita, I can't stay here.

68
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,217
- Prima donna.
- I'll handle it. What's the matter?

69
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,060
I hate this place. I stayed here
two years ago. I was miserable.

70
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:43,966
- It's a fleabag. I'm not staying here.
- You're not staying here.

71
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,163
I'm not?

72
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:49,674
Larry's dropping me off. I booked you
in a nice bed-and-breakfast.

73
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:57,245
Great. I think this is the trait
of a really good producer:

74
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,011
Keep the talent happy.

75
00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:00,676
Anything I can do.

76
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,745
Would you help me
with my pelvic tilt?

77
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:06,920
Within reason.

78
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:09,051
Would you like to have dinner
with Larry and me?

79
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:12,256
No, thank you.
I've seen Larry eat.

80
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:17,568
Get your sleep.
I'll see you in the morning.

81
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,972
Don't be late.

82
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:24,735
Did he actually
call himself"the talent"?

83
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:54,806
Okay, campers, rise and shine.

84
00:07:54,873 --> 00:07:57,774
Don't forget your booties
because it's cold out there today.

85
00:07:57,843 --> 00:08:00,778
It's cold out there every day.
What is this, Miami Beach?

86
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:06,478
Not hardly. You can expect hazardous
travel later with that blizzard thing.

87
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:10,147
"That blizzard thing"?
Here's the report.

88
00:08:10,222 --> 00:08:13,783
The National Weather Service
is calling for a big blizzard thing.

89
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:17,795
They are. But there's another reason
why today is especially exciting.

90
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:19,626
Especially cold.

91
00:08:19,698 --> 00:08:21,757
The big question
on everybody's lips...

92
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,326
On their chapped lips.

93
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:28,339
Do you think Phil will come out
and see his shadow?

94
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,171
- Punxsutawney Phil.
- That's right, woodchuck chuckers.

95
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:33,336
It's Groundhog Day!

96
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:38,611
- Get up and check that hog!
- Come here, groundhog!

97
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:42,019
Good morning.

98
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:44,180
- You off to see the groundhog?
- I am.

99
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:46,520
Do you think
it will be an early spring?

100
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:49,356
I'm predicting March 21.

101
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,521
Good guess.

102
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:54,964
I think that actually is
the first day of spring.

103
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,038
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

104
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:06,043
I slept alone, Mrs. Lancaster.

105
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:10,380
- Would you like some coffee?
- Is there any possibility...

106
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:13,384
of getting an espresso
or a cappuccino this morning?

107
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,852
I really don't know.

108
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:18,014
How to spell "espresso"
or "cappuccino."

109
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:19,681
This looks fine.

110
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:23,216
- I hope you enjoy the festivities.
- I'm sure I will.

111
00:09:23,295 --> 00:09:25,456
There's talk of a blizzard.

112
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:29,228
We may catch a break
and have that blizzard blow by us.

113
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:31,701
All this moisture coming up
out of the south...

114
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,238
will probably push on
east of us.

115
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:37,707
At high altitudes it will crystallize
and give us what we call snow.

116
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:39,403
Probably will be some accumulation...

117
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:43,312
but here in Punxsutawney our high
will be about 30 today, teens tonight.

118
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:47,318
Chance of precipitation
about 20 percent today and tomorrow.

119
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,480
Did you want to talk about the weather
or were you just making chitchat?

120
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:54,720
- Chitchat.
- See you later.

121
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:59,025
- Bye.
- Will you be checking out today?

122
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:02,259
Chance of departure today:
100 percent.

123
00:10:24,723 --> 00:10:27,521
Phil Connors?
I thought that was you!

124
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,925
How you doing?
Thanks for watching.

125
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:34,659
Don't tell me you don't remember me.
I sure as heck-fire remember you.

126
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:41,366
- Not a chance.
- Ned Ryerson!

127
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:43,864
Needlenose Ned.
Ned the Head.

128
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:46,502
Come on, buddy.
Case Western High.

129
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:51,606
I did the whistling belly button trick
at the high school talent show. Bing!

130
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:55,744
Got the shingles real bad senior year,
almost didn't graduate.

131
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,914
Bing again!

132
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,222
I dated your sister Mary Pat
till you told me not to anymore.

133
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:11,935
Did you turn pro
with that belly button thing or what?

134
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,495
- I sell insurance.
- What a shock.

135
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,237
Do you have life insurance?
You could always use a little more.

136
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,575
Am I right or am I right
or am I right? Right?

137
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:27,517
I would love to stand here and talk
with you, but I'm not going to.

138
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:30,818
- See you.
- I'll walk with you.

139
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:33,824
Whenever I see an opportunity now,
I charge it like a bull.

140
00:11:33,892 --> 00:11:35,985
Ned the Bull, that's me now.

141
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:39,997
I have friends who live and die
by the actuarial tables.

142
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:43,000
It's all one big crap shoot.

143
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:45,366
Have you ever heard
of single premium life?

144
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:48,201
I think that really could be
the ticket for you.

145
00:11:48,273 --> 00:11:52,676
God!
It is so good to see you!

146
00:11:52,744 --> 00:11:55,679
- What are you doing for dinner?
- Something else.

147
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:59,205
It's been great seeing you,
Needlehead. Take care.

148
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:06,849
Watch out for that first step.
It's a doozy!

149
00:12:13,098 --> 00:12:17,034
Strike up the music
The band has begun

150
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:20,538
The Pennsylvania Polka

151
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:24,872
Pick out your partner
and join in the fun

152
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:32,379
It started in Scranton
It's now number one

153
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,284
It's gonna entertain you

154
00:12:36,955 --> 00:12:38,820
Phil, over here!

155
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,551
Where have you been?

156
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:44,722
It was horrible.
A giant leech got me.

157
00:12:44,796 --> 00:12:47,560
You're missing all the fun.
These people are great.

158
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,727
Some have been partying all night.
They sing until they get too cold...

159
00:12:50,802 --> 00:12:55,739
then they sit by the fire,
get warm and sing some more.

160
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:59,909
They're hicks, Rita.

161
00:12:59,978 --> 00:13:04,438
Did you sleep okay without me?
You tossed and turned, didn't you?

162
00:13:04,516 --> 00:13:07,349
- You're incredible.
- Who told you?

163
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,582
It's groundhog time.

164
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,222
On me in three.

165
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,159
Two, one.

166
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,930
Once a year, the eyes of the nation turn
to this tiny Pennsylvania hamlet...

167
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:25,936
to watch a master at work.

168
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:28,598
The master?
Punxsutawney Phil...

169
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:32,110
the world's most famous weatherman,
the groundhog...

170
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:36,477
who, as legend has it, can predict
the coming of an early spring.

171
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:41,578
The question we have to ask ourselves
today is, "Does Phil feel lucky?"

172
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:45,112
Then it's the same old schtick.

173
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,954
The guy with the big stick
raps on the door.

174
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:50,961
They pull the little rat out.
They talk to him.

175
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:54,362
The rat talks back and then
they tell us what's gonna happen.

176
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,963
Isn't he cute?

177
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,009
You like your guys
with prominent upper teeth?

178
00:14:18,423 --> 00:14:22,519
"This February 2,
at 7:20 and 30 seconds...

179
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,997
Punxsutawney Phil,
the seer of seers...

180
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:29,124
prognosticator
of prognosticators...

181
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,637
emerged reluctantly,
but alertly...

182
00:14:32,704 --> 00:14:34,899
in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania...

183
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:37,840
and stated in Groundhogese...

184
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:40,207
'I definitely see a shadow."'

185
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:46,881
Sorry, folks.
Six more weeks of winter.

186
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:56,353
On me in three. Two, one.

187
00:14:56,461 --> 00:15:00,192
Television really fails to capture
the true excitement...

188
00:15:00,265 --> 00:15:03,530
of a large squirrel
predicting the weather.

189
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,695
I, for one, am very grateful
to have been here.

190
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:09,832
From Punxsutawney,
this is Phil Connors. So long.

191
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:12,399
Want to try it again
without the sarcasm?

192
00:15:12,477 --> 00:15:14,707
We got it.
I'm out of here.

193
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,544
Prima donnas.

194
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:32,859
Boy, take a look at this.

195
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:37,026
- What is going on?
- I don't know.

196
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,832
Perhaps it's that giant blizzard
we're not supposed to get.

197
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,566
This is impossible.

198
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,937
Nobody honks this horn but me, pal.

199
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,833
Take this rig out of here.

200
00:16:10,902 --> 00:16:12,927
Commander, what's going on?

201
00:16:13,004 --> 00:16:15,063
There's nothing going on.
We're closing the road.

202
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,906
- Big blizzard moving in.
- What blizzard? It's a couple flakes.

203
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:21,844
Don't you listen to the weather?
We got a major storm here.

204
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:24,108
I make the weather!

205
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:26,616
All this moisture coming up
out of the Gulf...

206
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,245
will push off to the east
and hit Altoona.

207
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,949
Pal, you got that moisture
on your head.

208
00:16:32,023 --> 00:16:36,619
You can go back to Punxsutawney
or you can freeze to death.

209
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:40,131
It's your choice.
What's it gonna be?

210
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:44,258
I'm thinking.

211
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,999
All the long-distance lines
are down?

212
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:53,836
What about the satellite?
Is it snowing in space?

213
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:59,475
Don't you have a line you keep open
for emergencies or for celebrities?

214
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:03,486
I'm both.
I'm a celebrity in an emergency.

215
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:06,022
Can you patch me through
on that line, please?

216
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,023
Can I have one more
with booze in it?

217
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,861
I like it here.

218
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:22,703
Phil, are you going
to the groundhog dinner?

219
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:25,538
I had groundhog for lunch.
It wasn't bad.

220
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,170
Tastes like chicken.
You two run along.

221
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:32,211
Looking foxy tonight, man.

222
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:35,378
Is your troop selling cookies
again this year?

223
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:37,819
That's so funny, Phil.

224
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:39,516
What are you gonna do?

225
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:43,220
I'm going back to my room
and take a hot shower.

226
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:46,196
Maybe read Hustler
or something.

227
00:17:46,264 --> 00:17:47,697
Suit yourself.

228
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:54,237
God!

229
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,912
Yo, Mom.
Isn't there any hot water?

230
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,547
There wouldn't be today.

231
00:18:11,656 --> 00:18:14,420
Of course not.
Silly me.

232
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:15,925
Sweet dreams.

233
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,787
Nice going, boys.
You're playing yesterday's tape.

234
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,480
Chapped lips.

235
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,291
What the hell?

236
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:41,178
Good morning.
Off to see the groundhog?

237
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,840
Think it will be an early spring?

238
00:19:43,915 --> 00:19:46,349
Didn't we do this yesterday?

239
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,682
I don't know what you mean.

240
00:19:48,753 --> 00:19:51,017
Don't mess with me, Pork Chop.

241
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:56,186
- What day is this?
- It's February 2. Groundhog Day.

242
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:02,024
I thought it was yesterday.

243
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,883
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

244
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,892
Did I sleep well?

245
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,727
- Would you like some coffee?
- Please. I think I'll have a double.

246
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:36,528
I hope you enjoy the festivities.

247
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:38,899
There's talk of a blizzard.

248
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,907
Do you ever have deja vu?

249
00:20:43,975 --> 00:20:46,910
I don't think so,
but I could check with the kitchen.

250
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:48,912
That's okay. Thank you.

251
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:53,082
Will you be checking out today?

252
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:59,089
I'd say the chance of departure
is 80 percent.

253
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,116
Seventy-five, eighty.

254
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:09,357
Excuse me.

255
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,198
Where is everybody going?

256
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,671
To Gobbler's Knob.
It's Groundhog Day.

257
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,436
It's still just once a year,
isn't it?

258
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:33,955
Phil Connors.
I thought that was you.

259
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:40,263
Don't you say you don't remember me.
I sure as heck-fire remember you.

260
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,962
Ned Ryerson?

261
00:21:43,034 --> 00:21:46,595
Bing!
First shot right out of the box!

262
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:49,606
How's it going, old buddy?

263
00:21:49,674 --> 00:21:52,609
Actually, I'm not feeling well.
Would you excuse me?

264
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:55,145
It's funny
you should mention your health.

265
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:57,977
You will never guess what I do now.

266
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:01,143
- Do you sell insurance?
- Bing again!

267
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:03,278
You are sharp as a tack today.

268
00:22:03,354 --> 00:22:07,984
Do you have life insurance?
If you do, you could always use more.

269
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:10,152
Right?
Who couldn't?

270
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:15,791
You know something?
I got a feeling you ain't got any.

271
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,360
- Am I right or am I right?
- I gotta go.

272
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:28,338
Watch out for that first step.
It's a doozy.

273
00:22:53,571 --> 00:22:55,505
Phil, over here!

274
00:22:57,742 --> 00:23:00,506
- Where have you been?
- Rita, do me a favor.

275
00:23:00,578 --> 00:23:03,877
I need someone to give me
a good hard slap in the face.

276
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,941
- How's that?
- Good.

277
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:11,887
If you need help with the other cheek,
let me know. I'm right here.

278
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:16,689
- Something's going on.
- Are you drunk or something?

279
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:20,390
Drunk's more fun.
Can I be serious for a minute?

280
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,696
- I don't know. Can you?
- I'm being serious.

281
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:27,829
I'm having a problem.
I may be having a problem.

282
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:32,834
- It's groundhog time.
- I knew you would say that.

283
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:36,539
I really feel weird.

284
00:23:36,614 --> 00:23:39,048
Let's just do this,
then we'll talk.

285
00:23:41,152 --> 00:23:42,813
On me in three.

286
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,786
Two, one.

287
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:48,883
It's Groundhog Day again.

288
00:23:48,993 --> 00:23:53,259
That must mean we're at Gobbler's Knob
waiting for the forecast...

289
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,891
from the world's most famous
groundhog weatherman...

290
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,558
Punxsutawney Phil...

291
00:23:57,635 --> 00:24:01,264
who's just about to tell us
how much more winter we can expect.

292
00:24:07,178 --> 00:24:08,645
This is a riot.

293
00:24:12,116 --> 00:24:13,413
Isn't he cute?

294
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:39,468
Yeah, Sport,
I know there's a blizzard.

295
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,775
When are the long-distance lines
gonna be repaired?

296
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:48,318
What if there is no tomorrow?
There wasn't one today.

297
00:24:50,221 --> 00:24:51,620
Hello?

298
00:25:45,743 --> 00:25:48,507
Good morning.
Off to see the groundhog?

299
00:25:54,752 --> 00:25:57,277
Did you sleep well, Mr...

300
00:26:12,303 --> 00:26:13,702
I thought...

301
00:26:15,306 --> 00:26:18,537
Don't say you don't remember me.
I sure as heck-fire remember you.

302
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:20,873
It's me, Ned Ryerson!

303
00:26:20,945 --> 00:26:23,573
Needlenose Ned. Ned the Head.
Come on, buddy. Case Western...

304
00:26:29,153 --> 00:26:31,383
Over here!

305
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:34,892
- Where have you been?
- Can we talk about a nonwork matter?

306
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:37,894
- You never talk about work.
- We really have to talk. Come on.

307
00:26:37,962 --> 00:26:41,261
- It's a creative meeting. Forget it.
- Wait a second. We've got work to do.

308
00:26:41,332 --> 00:26:44,096
I don't.
I've already done it twice.

309
00:26:44,168 --> 00:26:47,103
When you get finished,
meet me in the diner.

310
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,734
- What's that all about?
- I don't know.

311
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,539
Prima donnas.

312
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,048
More coffee, hon?

313
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,913
No, thanks.
Just the check, please.

314
00:27:00,985 --> 00:27:04,751
- These sticky buns are heaven.
- Aren't they?

315
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,750
Just put that anywhere, pal.

316
00:27:08,826 --> 00:27:10,293
Good save.

317
00:27:12,363 --> 00:27:15,423
Tell me why you're too sick to work,
and it better be good.

318
00:27:17,668 --> 00:27:21,764
I'm reliving the same day
over and over.

319
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:24,774
Groundhog Day. Today.

320
00:27:24,842 --> 00:27:26,776
I'm waiting for the punch line.

321
00:27:26,844 --> 00:27:31,304
Really.
This is the third time.

322
00:27:31,382 --> 00:27:33,373
It's like yesterday never happened.

323
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:37,547
I am racking my brain, but I can't
imagine why you'd make this up.

324
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:41,251
I'm not making it up.
I am asking you for help!

325
00:27:41,325 --> 00:27:43,691
What do you want me to do?

326
00:27:43,761 --> 00:27:47,253
I don't know! You're a producer,
come up with something.

327
00:27:47,331 --> 00:27:48,821
You want my advice?

328
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,803
You should get your head examined
if you expect me to believe that story.

329
00:27:53,871 --> 00:27:55,668
Like the groundhog Phil?

330
00:27:59,043 --> 00:28:01,477
Look out for your shadow, pal.

331
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:04,246
Morons, your bus is leaving.

332
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:08,080
You guys ready?
We better get going...

333
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,155
- to stay ahead of the weather.
- Let's talk back in Pittsburgh.

334
00:28:11,255 --> 00:28:13,746
I'm not going back to Pittsburgh.

335
00:28:13,824 --> 00:28:16,292
- Why not?
- Because of the blizzard.

336
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,658
You said that would hit Altoona.

337
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:22,358
I know that's what I said.

338
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:25,197
I think you need help.

339
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:28,363
That's what I've been saying.
I need help.

340
00:28:29,907 --> 00:28:32,501
No spots, no clots...

341
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:35,512
no tumors, no lesions...

342
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,377
no aneurisms.

343
00:28:37,448 --> 00:28:39,382
None that I can see.

344
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:43,216
If you want a CAT scan or an MRI,
you have to go into Pittsburgh.

345
00:28:43,287 --> 00:28:45,687
I can't go into Pittsburgh.

346
00:28:45,756 --> 00:28:49,021
- Why can't you go into Pittsburgh?
- There's a blizzard.

347
00:28:49,093 --> 00:28:51,027
Right. The blizzard.

348
00:28:51,095 --> 00:28:54,394
You know what you may need,
Mr. Connors?

349
00:28:54,465 --> 00:28:56,399
A biopsy.

350
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:57,866
A psychiatrist.

351
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:03,673
That's an unusual problem,
Mr. Connors.

352
00:29:05,476 --> 00:29:08,673
Most of my work is
with couples, families.

353
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:10,179
I have an alcoholic now.

354
00:29:12,316 --> 00:29:16,719
You went to college, right?
It wasn't veterinary psychology, was it?

355
00:29:16,787 --> 00:29:20,245
Didn't you take some course
that covered this stuff?

356
00:29:20,324 --> 00:29:22,884
Sort of. I guess.

357
00:29:24,328 --> 00:29:26,159
Abnormal psychology.

358
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:30,963
So, what do I do?

359
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,094
I think we should meet again.

360
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:36,071
How's tomorrow for you?

361
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:40,209
Is that not good?

362
00:29:50,988 --> 00:29:53,923
I was in the Virgin Islands once.

363
00:29:53,991 --> 00:29:56,084
I met a girl.

364
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,926
We ate lobster,
drank pina coladas.

365
00:29:59,997 --> 00:30:02,625
At sunset,
we made love like sea otters.

366
00:30:05,836 --> 00:30:08,930
That was a pretty good day.

367
00:30:09,006 --> 00:30:14,672
Why couldn't I get that day
over and over and over?

368
00:30:14,745 --> 00:30:17,612
You know, some guys
would look at this glass...

369
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:20,617
and they would say,
"That glass is half empty."

370
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:24,485
Other guys would say,
"That glass is half full."

371
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:28,117
I peg you as a "glass is half empty"
kind of guy. Am I right?

372
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,626
What would you do
if you were stuck in one place...

373
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:37,634
and every day was exactly the same,
and nothing that you did mattered?

374
00:30:40,037 --> 00:30:42,972
That sums it up for me.

375
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:53,346
Good luck.
I'll drop you off.

376
00:30:55,419 --> 00:31:00,254
- This thing sticks. You gotta jiggle it.
- Come on up here.

377
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:04,522
- My gosh.
- Give me your keys, pal.

378
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:08,498
Friends don't let friends drive.
Stand up here. Take a deep breath.

379
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:10,500
You feel okay? Really?

380
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,001
You're all right.

381
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:21,511
You want to throw up here
or in the car?

382
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:26,642
- I think both.
- Come on.

383
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:37,859
I don't think I should be driving.

384
00:31:37,928 --> 00:31:41,193
I don't either.
Watch your head.

385
00:31:41,265 --> 00:31:43,529
Watch your knees.
Don't break anything.

386
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:46,934
All right.
Let's not forget seat belts.

387
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:52,033
Who else could go
for some flapjacks right now?

388
00:31:57,047 --> 00:31:59,208
Let me ask you guys a question.

389
00:31:59,283 --> 00:32:03,549
- Shoot.
- What if there were no tomorrow?

390
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:07,557
No tomorrow? That would mean
there would be no consequences.

391
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:11,959
There would be no hangovers.
We could do whatever we wanted!

392
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:17,897
That's true.
We could do whatever we want.

393
00:32:23,507 --> 00:32:27,136
If we wanted to hit mailboxes,
we could let Ralph drive!

394
00:32:33,984 --> 00:32:36,748
- I think they want you to stop.
- Hang on.

395
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,523
It's the same thing
your whole life:

396
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:47,894
"Clean up your room." " Stand up
straight." " Pick up your feet."

397
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:52,493
"Take it like a man."
"Be nice to your sister."

398
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,095
"Don't mix beer and wine, ever."

399
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:59,108
"Don't drive
on the railroad tracks."

400
00:32:59,176 --> 00:33:01,974
Phil, that's one
I happen to agree with.

401
00:33:11,355 --> 00:33:13,789
I don't know, Gus.

402
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:19,353
Sometimes I think you just have
to take the big chances.

403
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,955
This is the police!
Pull over immediately!

404
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:25,464
We're talking in here.

405
00:33:30,574 --> 00:33:32,633
I'm betting he'll swerve first.

406
00:33:46,757 --> 00:33:50,158
I'm not gonna live
by their rules anymore.

407
00:33:50,227 --> 00:33:54,721
- I noticed that.
- You make choices and live with them.

408
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:10,436
My knee.

409
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:15,218
Let me handle this.

410
00:34:16,787 --> 00:34:20,553
Three cheeseburgers,
two large fries...

411
00:34:20,624 --> 00:34:22,717
two chocolate shakes
and one large Coke.

412
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:27,025
- And some flapjacks.
- Too early for flapjacks?

413
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,914
Rise and shine, campers!

414
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:47,746
Don't forget your booties
because it's cold out there today!

415
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:52,949
It's cold out there every day.
What is this, Miami Beach? Not hardly.

416
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,091
Slept like a baby.
Thank you.

417
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:01,757
- I'd love some of your coffee.
- I hope...

418
00:35:01,832 --> 00:35:05,598
Flurries moving in later, but
the blizzard will hit outside of town.

419
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:09,264
Mrs. Lancaster, was anybody
looking for me here this morning?

420
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:13,572
Perhaps a state official?
Maybe a blue hat, gun, nightstick?

421
00:35:13,677 --> 00:35:16,271
No one like that.
Will there be?

422
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:17,780
Apparently not.

423
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:23,278
Hold my room for me, please.
I'm staying an extra day.

424
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,351
Catch you tomorrow, Pops.

425
00:36:10,534 --> 00:36:13,833
I like to see a man of advancing years
throwing caution to the wind.

426
00:36:13,904 --> 00:36:16,998
It's inspiring, in a way.

427
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,599
My years are not advancing
as fast as you might think.

428
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,143
More coffee, hon?

429
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:22,974
Just keep it coming, please.

430
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:24,480
Sure thing.

431
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,844
Just put that anywhere, pal.

432
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:30,352
Good save.

433
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:36,086
Don't you worry about cholesterol,
lung cancer, love handles?

434
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:40,093
I don't worry
about anything anymore.

435
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:42,928
What makes you so special?
Everybody worries about something.

436
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,994
That's exactly what makes me so special.
I don't even have to floss.

437
00:36:57,247 --> 00:36:58,646
What?

438
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:04,482
"The wretch,
concentered all in self...

439
00:37:04,521 --> 00:37:07,012
Living,
shall forfeit fair renown...

440
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:10,356
And, doubly dying,
shall go down...

441
00:37:10,427 --> 00:37:13,726
To the vile dust,
from whence he sprung...

442
00:37:13,797 --> 00:37:17,858
Unwept, unhonor'd, and unsung."

443
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:20,403
Sir Walter Scott.

444
00:37:23,373 --> 00:37:27,241
- You don't like poetry?
- I love poetry.

445
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:30,747
I just thought that was Willard Scott.
I was confused.

446
00:37:30,814 --> 00:37:33,544
Do you think I'm acting like this
because I'm egocentric?

447
00:37:33,617 --> 00:37:36,916
I know you're egocentric.
It's your defining characteristic.

448
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:42,717
Are you guys ready? We better get going
to stay ahead of the weather.

449
00:37:42,826 --> 00:37:46,557
Thanks, Larry.
Would you like a doggie bag?

450
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:50,566
- I'll stay here and finish.
- I thought you hated this town.

451
00:37:50,634 --> 00:37:53,728
It's beginning to grow on me.

452
00:37:53,837 --> 00:37:55,395
Larry, quit staring.

453
00:37:55,472 --> 00:37:57,099
These are excellent.

454
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:12,452
Did you see the groundhog
this morning?

455
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:14,957
I never miss it.

456
00:38:15,025 --> 00:38:16,959
What's your name?

457
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,592
Nancy Taylor.
And you are?

458
00:38:20,664 --> 00:38:23,462
- What high school did you go to?
- What?

459
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:28,130
- High school.
- Lincoln, in Pittsburgh.

460
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:32,141
- Who are you?
- Who was your senior English teacher?

461
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,473
Are you kidding?

462
00:38:34,511 --> 00:38:38,311
- Your 12th-grade English teacher was...
- Mrs. Walsh.

463
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:43,149
Nancy. Lincoln. Walsh.
Thanks very much.

464
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:07,169
Lincoln High School.

465
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:10,008
I sat next to you
in Mrs. Walsh's English class.

466
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,014
I'm sorry.

467
00:39:15,085 --> 00:39:18,145
- That's amazing.
- You don't remember me, do you?

468
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,386
I even asked you to the prom.

469
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,225
I was short,
and I've sprouted.

470
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:34,370
Gosh! How are you?

471
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:38,106
Great.
You look terrific.

472
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:40,666
You look very terrific.

473
00:39:42,946 --> 00:39:46,507
- I have to do this report.
- Are you a reporter?

474
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:49,518
I'm a weatherman
with Channel 9 Pittsburgh.

475
00:39:49,586 --> 00:39:51,781
I should have known.
That's great!

476
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,652
Maybe later we could...

477
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,214
Whatever.

478
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:58,523
Stay right here.
Promise me?

479
00:39:58,595 --> 00:40:01,063
I'll be right back.
Wish me luck.

480
00:40:01,131 --> 00:40:02,530
Good luck!

481
00:40:28,158 --> 00:40:29,716
Who's Rita?

482
00:40:29,793 --> 00:40:31,727
How should I know?

483
00:40:31,795 --> 00:40:34,559
Is this some kind
of one-night stand?

484
00:40:34,631 --> 00:40:37,566
On the contrary, Nancy.
I love you.

485
00:40:37,634 --> 00:40:40,728
I've always loved you.

486
00:40:40,804 --> 00:40:44,740
This is gonna seem sudden, but...

487
00:40:44,808 --> 00:40:47,743
Nancy, will you be my wife?

488
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,453
Whatever.

489
00:41:02,826 --> 00:41:04,760
A gust of wind.

490
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,463
A dog barks.

491
00:41:10,033 --> 00:41:11,466
Cue the truck.

492
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,409
Exit Herman.

493
00:41:20,477 --> 00:41:23,139
Walk into the bank.

494
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:27,274
Exit Felix. Stand there with
a not-so-bright look on your face.

495
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:31,210
All right, Doris, come on.

496
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:34,746
Fix your bra, honey.
That's better.

497
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:38,761
"Felix."
"How you doing, Doris?"

498
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:42,492
"Can I have a roll of quarters?"

499
00:41:42,532 --> 00:41:47,993
Ten, nine, eight...

500
00:41:48,071 --> 00:41:52,735
Car. Six, five...

501
00:41:52,809 --> 00:41:55,141
Quarters.

502
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,736
Three...

503
00:41:56,813 --> 00:41:58,337
two...

504
00:42:07,724 --> 00:42:10,192
- What?
- Did I bring out two bags or one?

505
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,319
I don't know.

506
00:42:39,289 --> 00:42:41,849
I thought we were going
to a costume party.

507
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:45,019
It's like I said,
I love this film.

508
00:42:45,128 --> 00:42:47,221
I've seen it
over a hundred times.

509
00:42:48,765 --> 00:42:52,701
I told you to call me Bronco.

510
00:42:52,769 --> 00:42:54,396
Sorry, Bronco.

511
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:05,881
My old fiance.
They never remember me.

512
00:43:09,152 --> 00:43:14,089
- That will be one adult and...
- Two adults.

513
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:28,327
The question we have to ask ourselves
today is, "Does Phil feel lucky?"

514
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:33,274
Rita, if you only had one day to live,
what would you do with it?

515
00:43:33,343 --> 00:43:36,073
I don't know, Phil.
What are you dying of?

516
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:41,913
I mean, the whole world
is about to explode. What do you do?

517
00:43:41,985 --> 00:43:44,579
I want to know
where to put the camera.

518
00:43:44,654 --> 00:43:47,282
Are you looking
for a date for the weekend?

519
00:43:47,357 --> 00:43:50,451
I'm just interested in you.

520
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:54,931
What do you want? What do you like?
What do you think about?

521
00:43:54,998 --> 00:43:57,466
What kind of men
are you interested in?

522
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:59,935
What do you do for fun?

523
00:44:00,003 --> 00:44:03,461
Is this for real or are you trying
to make me look like a fool?

524
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:07,773
I'm just trying to talk like normal
people talk. Isn't this how they talk?

525
00:44:07,844 --> 00:44:10,472
- Close.
- So talk to me.

526
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,607
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

527
00:44:14,684 --> 00:44:17,983
- And a donut.
- All right.

528
00:44:20,023 --> 00:44:22,116
What do you want
out of life?

529
00:44:24,027 --> 00:44:26,495
I guess I want
what everybody wants:

530
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:30,057
Career, love, marriage, children.

531
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,930
Are you seeing anyone?

532
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,493
I think this is
getting too personal.

533
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:37,098
I don't think I'm ready
to share this with you.

534
00:44:38,241 --> 00:44:40,505
How about you?
What do you want?

535
00:44:41,611 --> 00:44:45,138
What I really want
is someone like you.

536
00:44:45,248 --> 00:44:47,648
- Please.
- Why not?

537
00:44:47,717 --> 00:44:50,515
What are you looking for?
Who is your perfect guy?

538
00:44:51,888 --> 00:44:55,824
First of all, he's too humble
to know he's perfect.

539
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,818
That's me.

540
00:44:58,895 --> 00:45:02,353
He's intelligent,
supportive, funny.

541
00:45:04,901 --> 00:45:08,302
Me, me, me.

542
00:45:08,371 --> 00:45:12,808
- He's romantic and courageous.
- Me also.

543
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:16,972
He's got a good body, but doesn't look
in the mirror every two minutes.

544
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:22,508
I have a great body, and sometimes
I go months without looking.

545
00:45:24,921 --> 00:45:28,516
He's kind, sensitive and gentle.

546
00:45:28,558 --> 00:45:31,026
He's not afraid to cry
in front of me.

547
00:45:31,094 --> 00:45:33,688
This is a man, right?

548
00:45:33,763 --> 00:45:39,030
He likes animals and children,
and he'll change poopy diapers.

549
00:45:39,102 --> 00:45:41,536
Does he have
to use the word "poopy"?

550
00:45:43,106 --> 00:45:46,542
And he plays an instrument,
and he loves his mother.

551
00:45:47,777 --> 00:45:51,042
I am really close on this one.

552
00:45:58,488 --> 00:46:00,217
It's Phil Connors.

553
00:46:00,323 --> 00:46:03,258
Hello.
Thanks for watching.

554
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,905
So, what are the chances
of getting out today?

555
00:46:19,976 --> 00:46:22,444
The van still won't start.
Larry's working on it.

556
00:46:22,512 --> 00:46:26,073
Wouldn't you know it.
Can I buy you a drink?

557
00:46:28,518 --> 00:46:31,351
Jim Beam, ice, water.

558
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:33,286
For you, miss?

559
00:46:33,356 --> 00:46:36,917
Sweet vermouth on the rocks
with a twist, please.

560
00:46:42,365 --> 00:46:44,765
What are the chances
of getting out of town today?

561
00:46:44,834 --> 00:46:47,462
The van still won't start.
Larry's working on it.

562
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:51,600
Wouldn't you know it.
Can I buy you a drink?

563
00:46:54,377 --> 00:46:56,845
Sweet vermouth,
rocks with a twist, please.

564
00:46:56,913 --> 00:47:00,474
- For you, miss?
- The same.

565
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:04,476
- That's my favorite drink.
- Mine too.

566
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:09,481
It always makes me think of Rome,
the way the sun hits the buildings.

567
00:47:11,194 --> 00:47:13,287
What shall we drink to?

568
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:16,624
To the groundhog.

569
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,964
I always drink to world peace.

570
00:47:27,977 --> 00:47:30,138
Can I buy you a drink?

571
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:36,208
Sweet vermouth,
rocks with a twist, please.

572
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:38,652
For you, miss?

573
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:42,818
The same.
That's my favorite drink.

574
00:47:42,892 --> 00:47:45,520
Mine too.

575
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:47,996
It always makes me think of Rome...

576
00:47:48,064 --> 00:47:52,831
the way the sun hits the buildings.

577
00:47:52,902 --> 00:47:54,995
What shall we drink to?

578
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,005
I like to say a prayer
and drink to world peace.

579
00:48:01,911 --> 00:48:04,846
To world peace.

580
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:09,742
Amen.

581
00:48:13,923 --> 00:48:17,381
- This is wonderful.
- Didn't I tell you?

582
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,519
How do you know so much
about Punxsutawney?

583
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:22,190
I've spent a lot of time here.

584
00:48:22,265 --> 00:48:25,701
- Small town people are more real.
- That's how I feel.

585
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:28,203
Really?
Would you like some white chocolate?

586
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:31,866
- Don't make me sick.
- No white chocolate.

587
00:48:31,941 --> 00:48:35,035
There is something familiar
about this.

588
00:48:35,111 --> 00:48:39,377
- Do you ever have deja vu?
- Didn't you just ask me that?

589
00:48:43,486 --> 00:48:47,217
People place too much emphasis
on their careers.

590
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:50,885
I wish we could all live
in the mountains at high altitude.

591
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,428
That's where I see myself
in five years.

592
00:48:53,496 --> 00:48:55,896
- How about you?
- I agree.

593
00:48:55,965 --> 00:49:00,061
I like to go with the flow,
see where it leads me.

594
00:49:00,136 --> 00:49:02,070
It's led you here.

595
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:07,573
It's a million miles
from where I started in college.

596
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:10,408
You weren't in broadcasting
or journalism?

597
00:49:12,148 --> 00:49:16,585
Believe it or not, I studied
19th-century French poetry.

598
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:18,416
What a waste of time.

599
00:49:18,521 --> 00:49:21,581
For someone else that would be
an incredible waste of time.

600
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:24,593
It was so bold of you to choose that.
It's incredible.

601
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:28,119
You must be a very strong person.

602
00:49:29,365 --> 00:49:33,096
People place too much emphasis
on their careers.

603
00:49:33,169 --> 00:49:37,936
I wish we could all live
in the mountains, at high altitudes.

604
00:49:38,007 --> 00:49:40,271
That's where I see myself
in five years.

605
00:49:40,343 --> 00:49:42,277
- How about you?
- I agree.

606
00:49:42,345 --> 00:49:45,610
I like to go with the flow,
see what happens.

607
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:48,446
It's gotten you here.

608
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:51,612
It's a million miles
from where I started in college.

609
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:54,782
You weren't in broadcasting
or journalism?

610
00:49:56,493 --> 00:50:00,452
Believe it or not, I studied
19th-century French poetry.

611
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,047
You speak French.

612
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:27,856
- I haven't done this since I was a kid.
- Me neither.

613
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:30,916
- It's fun.
- It's good, clean fun.

614
00:50:33,763 --> 00:50:37,699
I hope that one day I can do this
with my own children.

615
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:43,034
Where did you get that?

616
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:45,870
I went over to the snowman shop.

617
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:49,271
An assassin!

618
00:50:49,345 --> 00:50:51,313
I'll protect you,
Your Majesty.

619
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:54,509
I shall die for you!
You shall not take her!

620
00:50:54,617 --> 00:50:56,050
Find cover, my lady!

621
00:50:57,453 --> 00:50:59,387
- Nice arm.
- I'm getting some good ones.

622
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:02,390
There's a boy.
That's a boy. Good try.

623
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:04,449
- Got him.
- Help me.

624
00:52:01,584 --> 00:52:07,181
- What?
- I'm amazed, and I'm not easily amazed.

625
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:09,851
- About what?
- How you can start a day...

626
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:14,192
with one kind of expectation
and end up so completely different.

627
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:18,697
Do you like the way
this day is turning out?

628
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:21,362
I like it very much.

629
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:25,033
It's a perfect day.
You couldn't plan a day like this.

630
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:29,704
You can.
It just takes an awful lot of work.

631
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:32,213
Come on in.
I want to show you something.

632
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:34,716
- I don't think I should.
- I don't think you should either.

633
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:38,720
That's why I'll show you one thing
and kick you out. Just one minute.

634
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:49,527
It's just lovely.

635
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:03,912
Would you like to sit and stare
at the fake fire?

636
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:09,918
It's really a wonderful room.

637
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:11,544
It is now.

638
00:53:18,661 --> 00:53:21,255
I don't know.
I don't think we should do this.

639
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:22,764
I don't either.

640
00:53:25,668 --> 00:53:28,762
On second thought,
I think we should.

641
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:31,932
It's the perfect end
to a perfect day.

642
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:36,103
It's a little fast for me.

643
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:37,942
Me too.

644
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:40,278
Maybe I should go.

645
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,580
Where would you go?

646
00:53:42,685 --> 00:53:46,781
Why?
We've got a perfect fire.

647
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:49,586
I've got some French poetry here.
Baudelaire.

648
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:52,953
I will read to you.

649
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:56,123
I've got ice cream
on the windowsill.

650
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:58,133
Hold on a minute.

651
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:06,441
- Rocky Road?
- I love Rocky Road.

652
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:08,807
I thought so.

653
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:10,436
You have to stay.

654
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:14,813
I'm tired.
We can see each other tomorrow.

655
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:18,615
Tonight.
It's gotta be tonight.

656
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:23,659
- Really.
- Just stay for awhile.

657
00:54:23,726 --> 00:54:28,322
If you like it, stay for a while longer
and awhile longer.

658
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:32,994
- Let's not spoil it.
- I don't want to spoil it either.

659
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:36,163
You know I can't stay with you.

660
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:39,333
Why not? I love you.

661
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:43,470
You love me?

662
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:48,313
- You don't even know me.
- I know you.

663
00:54:50,253 --> 00:54:52,483
I can't believe I fell for this.

664
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:55,183
This whole day has just been
one long setup.

665
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:59,251
- It hasn't.
- And I hate fudge.

666
00:54:59,328 --> 00:55:01,558
No white chocolate.
No fudge.

667
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:05,499
What are you doing?
Are you making some kind of list?

668
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:09,197
Did you call my friends and ask
what I like and what I don't like?

669
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:12,867
- Is this what love is for you?
- This is real. This is love.

670
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:16,673
Stop saying that!
You must be crazy.

671
00:55:16,779 --> 00:55:20,510
I could never love someone like you.
You only love yourself.

672
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:24,644
That's not true. I don't even like
myself. Give me another chance.

673
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:28,519
That's for making me care about you.

674
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:38,526
- I haven't done this since I was a kid.
- Me neither.

675
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:41,399
- It's fun.
- Good, clean fun too.

676
00:55:41,437 --> 00:55:44,235
That's what's missing
in the world today.

677
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:46,901
I can't wait to do this
with my own children.

678
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:49,069
Golly, I want lots of kids!

679
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:51,079
I want to adopt.
I want to have my own.

680
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:54,708
I want foster kids.
I got this at Snowman City.

681
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:58,620
Some kid threw
a snowball at us!

682
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:01,623
Come here!
Let's have some fun!

683
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:06,621
I wish these were my own kids!

684
00:56:09,832 --> 00:56:11,925
Are any of you up for adoption?

685
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:15,827
Here's a humdinger over here!
Wasn't that great?

686
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:27,412
Stop it!

687
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:14,461
Over here!

688
00:57:16,532 --> 00:57:19,228
Where have you been?
You're missing all the fun.

689
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:21,327
You look terrible.

690
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:24,464
What happened?
Rough night?

691
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:46,818
Okay, campers, rise and shine.

692
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:51,829
Don't forget your booties
because it's cold out there today.

693
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:56,099
It's cold out there every day.

694
00:57:56,172 --> 00:58:00,131
This country's largest lake, Chapala,
is located near the city...

695
00:58:00,209 --> 00:58:02,370
- of Guadalajara.
- What is Mexico?

696
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:06,045
- Correct.
- "Lakes and Rivers," 400.

697
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:09,414
Seneca is the largest of these lakes
in West-Central New York.

698
00:58:09,485 --> 00:58:12,010
- What are the Finger Lakes?
- Correct.

699
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:14,022
- That's amazing.
- "Lakes and Rivers" for 600.

700
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,615
This South American lake drains
into the smaller lake in Bolivia.

701
00:58:16,692 --> 00:58:20,423
- What is Titicaca?
- Correct.

702
00:58:20,496 --> 00:58:22,896
- "Lakes and Rivers" for 1,000.
- Milky colored...

703
00:58:22,965 --> 00:58:24,398
- from glacial clay...
- What is the Rhone?

704
00:58:24,433 --> 00:58:28,392
When entering Lake Geneva,
this river is clear upon exiting.

705
00:58:28,437 --> 00:58:31,235
Jim?
The Rhone is good for $ 1,000.

706
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:36,142
- You are $500 off the lead.
- Let's go to "Inventors" for 200.

707
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:38,476
This is pitiful.

708
00:58:38,547 --> 00:58:43,314
A thousand people freezing their butts
off, waiting to worship a rat.

709
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:47,049
What a hype. Groundhog Day used
to mean something in this town.

710
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:49,717
They used to pull the hog out
and eat it!

711
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:52,886
You're hypocrites, all of you!

712
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:58,395
You got a problem
with what I'm saying?

713
00:58:58,434 --> 00:59:01,232
Untie your tongue,
and you come out here and talk.

714
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:03,272
Am I upsetting you, Princess?

715
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:08,367
You want a prediction about the weather,
you're asking the wrong Phil.

716
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:11,346
I'll give you a winter prediction.

717
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:13,678
It's gonna be cold...

718
00:59:13,749 --> 00:59:15,910
it's gonna be gray...

719
00:59:16,018 --> 00:59:21,183
and it's gonna last you
for the rest of your life.

720
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:59,794
Once again, the eyes of the nation
have turned here to this...

721
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:02,160
tiny village
in western Pennsylvania.

722
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:06,458
There is no way that
this winter...

723
01:00:06,535 --> 01:00:09,561
is ever going to end...

724
01:00:09,638 --> 01:00:13,597
as long as this groundhog
keeps seeing his shadow.

725
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:15,701
I don't see any other way out.

726
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:18,513
He has to be stopped.

727
01:00:19,715 --> 01:00:21,307
I have to stop him.

728
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,617
Real good, Phil.

729
01:00:27,723 --> 01:00:29,350
He's crazy.

730
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:37,262
I'm worried. I think there's something
really wrong with Phil.

731
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:39,927
There's a lot of things
really wrong with Phil.

732
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,404
I've come to the end of me.

733
01:00:46,475 --> 01:00:49,842
There's no way out now.

734
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:53,370
I just want you to remember
we had a beautiful day together once.

735
01:00:56,685 --> 01:01:00,246
All right, little fella.
Good job.

736
01:01:00,322 --> 01:01:02,916
- He smiled at me. Did you see that?
- I believe he did.

737
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,721
Okay, little fella.
There you go.

738
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:11,698
Hi, mister.
Something I can do you for?

739
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:16,304
What are you doing?

740
01:01:20,976 --> 01:01:23,137
Jake, get the word out!
Somebody kidnapped Phil!

741
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:24,770
We're going after him!

742
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:34,313
Why would anybody steal a groundhog?

743
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:37,382
I can probably think
of a couple of reasons. Pervert.

744
01:02:03,185 --> 01:02:06,712
- He must have just snapped!
- This should be good.

745
01:02:09,191 --> 01:02:12,126
What is he doing?
What can he be thinking?

746
01:02:12,194 --> 01:02:14,594
That's not bad
for a quadruped.

747
01:02:14,663 --> 01:02:18,497
You gotta check your mirrors,
just the side of your eye.

748
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,203
That's it.

749
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:28,869
They're chasing us!
Come on, make it fun!

750
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:40,184
Don't drive angry.

751
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:04,772
Hot dog! There's no way out except
the way we came in. We got him now!

752
01:03:23,732 --> 01:03:26,530
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.

753
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:33,665
If you gotta shoot, aim high.
I don't wanna hit the groundhog.

754
01:03:38,013 --> 01:03:40,243
We mustn't keep
our public waiting.

755
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:44,886
It's show time.

756
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,594
All right, on me, Larry,
in three!

757
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:58,591
Two, one.

758
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:16,918
He might be okay.

759
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:24,115
Probably not now.

760
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:41,867
Nuts.

761
01:04:48,917 --> 01:04:52,284
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

762
01:04:52,354 --> 01:04:55,949
Would you like some toast?

763
01:05:13,842 --> 01:05:17,403
- What's going on?
- My God.

764
01:05:49,678 --> 01:05:51,111
That's him.

765
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:57,779
He was a really great guy.

766
01:05:57,853 --> 01:06:00,686
I really liked him a lot.

767
01:06:08,163 --> 01:06:08,297
I'm sorry.
What was that again?

768
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,424
I'm sorry.
What was that again?

769
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:13,560
- I'm a god!
- You're a god?

770
01:06:13,635 --> 01:06:17,002
I'm a god.
I'm not the God, I don't think.

771
01:06:17,072 --> 01:06:19,666
Because you survived a car wreck?

772
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:21,334
You ready to order?

773
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:24,573
I didn't just survive a wreck.
I wasn't just blown up yesterday.

774
01:06:24,646 --> 01:06:27,513
I have been stabbed,
shot, poisoned...

775
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:30,518
frozen, hung, electrocuted...

776
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:32,850
- and burned.
- Really?

777
01:06:32,921 --> 01:06:37,688
Every morning I wake up fine,
not a dent in the fender.

778
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,719
- I am an immortal.
- Special today is blueberry waffles.

779
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:43,788
Why are you telling me this?

780
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:46,198
Because I want you
to believe in me.

781
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:51,365
You're not a god. Believe me. This is
12 years of Catholic school talking.

782
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,874
I could come back
if you're not ready.

783
01:06:53,942 --> 01:06:56,240
How do you know I'm not a god?

784
01:06:56,311 --> 01:07:00,145
Please!
Because it's not possible!

785
01:07:00,215 --> 01:07:03,275
- I'll come back.
- Doris!

786
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:09,920
This is Doris. Her brother-in-law,
Carl, owns this diner.

787
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:14,554
She's worked here since she was 17.
She wants to see Paris before she dies.

788
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:17,030
- Boy, would I!
- What are you doing?

789
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:20,660
- Debbie Kleiser and her fiance, Fred.
- Do I know you?

790
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:23,864
They're supposed to be married this
afternoon, but Debbie is reconsidering.

791
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:26,908
- What?
- Lovely ring.

792
01:07:26,975 --> 01:07:29,170
This is Bill who's been a waiter
for three years...

793
01:07:29,244 --> 01:07:31,735
since he left Penn State
and had to get work.

794
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:34,647
He likes the town, paints toy soldiers,
and he's gay.

795
01:07:34,716 --> 01:07:36,581
I am.

796
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:39,746
This is Gus. He hates his life here
and wishes he'd stayed in the Navy.

797
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:42,484
I could have retired on half pay
after 20 years.

798
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:44,617
Is this some kind of trick?

799
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:47,594
Maybe the real God uses tricks.
Maybe He's not omnipotent.

800
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:50,791
He's just been around so long,
He knows everything.

801
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:52,299
- Who's that?
- This is Tom.

802
01:07:52,367 --> 01:07:54,597
He worked in the coal mine
till they closed it down.

803
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,103
- Her?
- Alice.

804
01:07:56,171 --> 01:07:58,799
She came from Ireland as a baby
and lived in Erie most of her life.

805
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:01,001
- He's right.
- Nancy.

806
01:08:01,076 --> 01:08:05,809
She works in the dress shop and makes
chipmunk noises when she gets excited.

807
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:07,815
- It's true.
- How do you know these people?

808
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:12,684
I know everything. In five seconds,
a waiter will drop a tray of dishes.

809
01:08:12,754 --> 01:08:15,552
- Five, four, three, two, one.
- This is nuts.

810
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:19,760
That's enough.

811
01:08:21,396 --> 01:08:25,196
- Do you know me too?
- I know all about you.

812
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:28,065
You like producing, but you're hoping
for more than Channel 9 Pittsburgh.

813
01:08:28,136 --> 01:08:30,661
Everyone knows that.

814
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:34,004
You like boats, but not the ocean.

815
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:37,637
You go to a mountain lake in the summer
with your family.

816
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:39,738
There's a long, wooden dock
and a boathouse...

817
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:41,840
with boards missing
from the roof...

818
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:45,250
and a place you used to crawl
underneath to be alone.

819
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:49,689
You're a sucker for French poetry
and rhinestones.

820
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:51,487
You're very generous.

821
01:08:51,593 --> 01:08:54,426
You're kind to strangers
and children.

822
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:57,363
And when you stand in the snow,
you look like an angel.

823
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:59,367
How are you doing this?

824
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:05,372
I wake up every day right here...

825
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:08,934
in Punxsutawney,
and it's always February 2.

826
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:12,412
There's nothing
I can do about it.

827
01:09:13,282 --> 01:09:16,410
If you still doubt me...

828
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:18,976
in ten seconds...

829
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:22,751
Larry will come through that door
and take you away from me...

830
01:09:22,824 --> 01:09:25,520
but you can't let him.

831
01:09:25,627 --> 01:09:28,596
Please believe me.
You've got to believe me.

832
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:37,705
You ready? We better get going if we're
going to stay ahead of the weather.

833
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:40,037
What's that?

834
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:50,451
Maybe it really is happening.

835
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:52,646
How else could you know so much?

836
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:55,212
There is no way.
I'm not that smart.

837
01:09:56,391 --> 01:09:58,825
Maybe I should spend the day
with you...

838
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:02,421
as an objective witness,
just to see what happens.

839
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:05,228
This sounds
like a science project.

840
01:10:06,201 --> 01:10:08,897
Concentrate.
You gotta want it.

841
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:16,272
It's more in the wrist than the finger.
It's just gotta...

842
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:26,487
Be the hat! Come on! Go!

843
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,489
It would take me a year
to get good at this.

844
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:33,119
Six months. Four to five hours a day,
and you'd be an expert.

845
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:35,527
Is this what you do
with eternity?

846
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:37,258
Now you know.

847
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:40,658
That's not the worst part.

848
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:42,670
What's the worst part?

849
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:47,505
The worst part is that tomorrow you
will have forgotten all about this...

850
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:50,807
and you'll treat me
like a jerk again.

851
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:54,440
- It's all right. I am a jerk.
- You're not.

852
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:56,575
It doesn't make any difference.

853
01:10:56,685 --> 01:11:01,315
I've killed myself so many times,
I don't even exist anymore.

854
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:04,723
Sometimes I wish
I had a thousand lifetimes.

855
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:08,422
I don't know, Phil.
Maybe it's not a curse.

856
01:11:08,463 --> 01:11:11,023
It just depends on
how you look at it.

857
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,996
Gosh, you're an upbeat lady!

858
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:22,734
- It's been a really nice day for me.
- Me too.

859
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:27,839
Maybe, if it's not too boring,
we could do it again sometime.

860
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:29,850
I hope so.

861
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:43,355
You're still here.

862
01:11:44,966 --> 01:11:48,902
I thought you were supposed
to disappear or I was or something!

863
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:51,438
Not until 6:00.

864
01:11:51,506 --> 01:11:53,167
You rat!

865
01:11:53,241 --> 01:11:54,970
I never said midnight.

866
01:11:55,043 --> 01:12:00,003
- You knew I was waiting for midnight!
- Does this mean you're gonna leave?

867
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:04,919
Good.

868
01:12:15,597 --> 01:12:17,064
I'm sorry.

869
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:21,997
It's all right.
You can fall asleep.

870
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:26,404
I promise
I won't touch you, much.

871
01:12:27,642 --> 01:12:31,078
That's all right.
I'm not tired.

872
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:33,171
What were you saying?

873
01:12:34,382 --> 01:12:37,715
I think the last thing
that you heard was...

874
01:12:37,819 --> 01:12:40,344
"Only God can make a tree."

875
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:41,855
Really?

876
01:13:20,128 --> 01:13:22,062
What I wanted to say was...

877
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:29,435
I think you're the kindest, sweetest,
prettiest person...

878
01:13:29,504 --> 01:13:31,597
I've ever met in my life.

879
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:35,838
I've never seen anyone...

880
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:38,311
that's nicer to people
than you are.

881
01:13:51,526 --> 01:13:54,393
The first time I saw you...

882
01:13:54,462 --> 01:13:57,989
something happened to me.

883
01:13:58,066 --> 01:14:00,466
I never told you, but...

884
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:08,167
I knew that I wanted
to hold you as hard as I could.

885
01:14:21,022 --> 01:14:24,185
I don't deserve someone like you.

886
01:14:27,295 --> 01:14:30,560
But if I ever could...

887
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:32,998
I swear I would love you...

888
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:35,195
for the rest of my life.

889
01:14:39,774 --> 01:14:41,833
Did you say something?

890
01:14:47,382 --> 01:14:48,781
Good night.

891
01:16:01,389 --> 01:16:03,789
Who wants coffee?
Get it while it's hot.

892
01:16:03,858 --> 01:16:05,621
Thanks, Phil.

893
01:16:05,694 --> 01:16:10,722
- Larry? Skim milk, two sugars.
- Thanks, Phil.

894
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:13,393
- Pastry?
- We're just setting up.

895
01:16:13,435 --> 01:16:15,369
Take your pick.

896
01:16:16,604 --> 01:16:18,663
Thanks. Raspberry. Great.

897
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:22,301
I was just talking with Buster Green,
the head groundhog honcho.

898
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:25,369
He said if we set up over here,
we might get a better shot.

899
01:16:25,413 --> 01:16:28,109
- What do you think?
- Sounds good.

900
01:16:28,183 --> 01:16:29,616
What do you think?

901
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:32,853
Let's go for it.

902
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:35,913
- Good work.
- Maybe we'll get lucky.

903
01:16:36,024 --> 01:16:37,924
Let me help you
with the heavy stuff.

904
01:16:39,694 --> 01:16:42,629
You got your coffee.
I'll get it.

905
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:45,666
We never talk.
Do you have kids?

906
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:22,336
I'd like a piano lesson, please.

907
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:26,807
I'm with a student now. If you come
back tomorrow, I can squeeze you in.

908
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:30,072
I kind of want to get started.
I could give you $1,000.

909
01:17:32,313 --> 01:17:33,712
Come on in.

910
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:55,528
Good morning!
Off to see the groundhog?

911
01:17:58,673 --> 01:18:01,233
You think it will be
an early spring?

912
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:03,800
"Winter slumbering in the open air...

913
01:18:03,878 --> 01:18:05,812
wears on his smiling face...

914
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,848
a dream of spring."

915
01:18:49,924 --> 01:18:51,391
How's she look?

916
01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:53,986
- Great.
- Thank you.

917
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:56,030
Did you know
he could ice sculpt?

918
01:19:11,813 --> 01:19:14,907
Not bad.
You say this is your first lesson?

919
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:18,580
My father was a piano mover.

920
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:27,321
I thought it was you.

921
01:19:31,232 --> 01:19:33,826
I have missed you so much.

922
01:19:37,805 --> 01:19:41,741
I don't know where you're headed,
but can you call in sick?

923
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:47,842
I gotta get going.

924
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:49,975
It's good to see you.

925
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:10,264
Hello, father.

926
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:13,796
Let's get you someplace warm.

927
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:15,342
Remember me?

928
01:20:20,448 --> 01:20:23,508
Excuse me, sir. Are you the one
who brought the old man in?

929
01:20:23,585 --> 01:20:25,576
How is he?

930
01:20:25,653 --> 01:20:28,019
He just passed away.

931
01:20:29,290 --> 01:20:31,224
What did he die of?

932
01:20:31,292 --> 01:20:34,523
He was just old.
It was just his time.

933
01:20:37,365 --> 01:20:40,391
- I want to see his chart. Excuse me.
- Sir!

934
01:20:40,468 --> 01:20:42,629
You can't come in here.

935
01:20:42,704 --> 01:20:45,400
This is a restricted area.

936
01:20:54,415 --> 01:20:56,610
Where's the chart?

937
01:20:56,684 --> 01:20:59,881
Sometimes people just die.

938
01:20:59,954 --> 01:21:01,888
Not today.

939
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:15,669
It's hard down there
at the bottom.

940
01:21:18,906 --> 01:21:21,568
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

941
01:21:25,913 --> 01:21:27,904
Come on, Dad!
Come on, Pop!

942
01:21:31,953 --> 01:21:34,581
Breathe, Pop!

943
01:22:01,115 --> 01:22:03,709
When Chekhov
saw the long winter...

944
01:22:03,785 --> 01:22:07,687
he saw a winter bleak and dark
and bereft of hope.

945
01:22:07,755 --> 01:22:12,692
Yet we know that winter is just
another step in the cycle of life.

946
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:16,628
But standing here
among the people of Punxsutawney...

947
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:19,428
and basking in the warmth
of their hearths and hearts...

948
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:22,799
I couldn't imagine a better fate...

949
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:26,135
than a long and lustrous winter.

950
01:22:26,207 --> 01:22:29,199
From Punxsutawney,
it's Phil Connors.

951
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:30,710
So long.

952
01:22:32,413 --> 01:22:34,381
Very nice speech, Phil.

953
01:22:34,415 --> 01:22:36,747
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

954
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:40,049
- How was that for you two?
- Man, you touched me.

955
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:42,055
- Thanks, Larry.
- Thank you.

956
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:45,855
I gotta go.

957
01:22:45,927 --> 01:22:50,125
That was surprising.
I didn't know you were so versatile.

958
01:22:50,198 --> 01:22:52,132
I surprise myself sometimes.

959
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,259
Would you like
to get some coffee?

960
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:58,328
I'd love to. Can I have a rain check?
I've got some errands to run.

961
01:23:02,009 --> 01:23:05,945
What errands?
I thought we were going back.

962
01:23:15,623 --> 01:23:17,420
Hold it, fella!

963
01:23:24,232 --> 01:23:27,065
What do you say?

964
01:23:27,135 --> 01:23:30,571
You little brat.
You have never thanked me!

965
01:23:30,638 --> 01:23:33,903
I'll see you tomorrow, maybe!

966
01:23:41,015 --> 01:23:43,745
- Now what?
- You've totaled it.

967
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:48,915
It's only a flat tire.
Now just be patient. Just cool it!

968
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:52,892
- It's an earthquake!
- It's not an earthquake!

969
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,393
What is it?

970
01:23:57,665 --> 01:23:59,758
Thank you, young man.

971
01:24:00,902 --> 01:24:03,393
It's nothing.
I had the tire and the jack.

972
01:24:03,471 --> 01:24:06,167
Just be comfortable.
Be a minute.

973
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,764
Who is that?

974
01:24:07,842 --> 01:24:10,606
Must be from the motor club.

975
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:14,809
- My God! He's having a heart attack!
- What should I do?

976
01:24:14,882 --> 01:24:18,283
- Call an ambulance, a lawyer, a doctor!
- Mom, I don't think he's breathing!

977
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:28,161
I think that did it.

978
01:24:31,599 --> 01:24:34,534
If you're gonna eat steak,
get some sharper teeth.

979
01:24:34,602 --> 01:24:37,298
- Enjoy your lunch.
- Thank you.

980
01:24:37,371 --> 01:24:40,101
Who was that? I'm fine.

981
01:24:40,174 --> 01:24:42,972
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yes. Eat.

982
01:24:47,381 --> 01:24:50,043
People just don't understand
what is involved in this.

983
01:24:50,117 --> 01:24:52,051
This is an art form.

984
01:24:52,119 --> 01:24:54,849
You know, I think most people
just think that...

985
01:24:54,922 --> 01:24:58,085
I hold the camera
and point it at stuff.

986
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:00,627
There is a lot more to it
than just that.

987
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:05,829
Would you be at all interested
in seeing the inside of the van?

988
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:09,802
You know, I really have to get back
to the party.

989
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:13,830
Great idea. I'll go with you.
Let me just drop a tip here.

990
01:25:20,948 --> 01:25:23,815
How are you?
Rita, this is Nancy.

991
01:25:23,885 --> 01:25:26,319
We were just going
to the party.

992
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:28,321
- You going?
- Sounds like fun.

993
01:25:28,389 --> 01:25:30,983
Maybe we should call Phil.

994
01:25:31,058 --> 01:25:33,117
- I think he's already in there.
- Great.

995
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:32,608
- Isn't he good?
- He's great!

996
01:27:32,713 --> 01:27:34,647
He's my student.

997
01:27:36,951 --> 01:27:38,885
I'm so proud.

998
01:27:40,021 --> 01:27:41,420
Thank you.

999
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:44,482
Welcome to our party.

1000
01:27:44,558 --> 01:27:48,358
- I didn't know you could play like that.
- I'm versatile.

1001
01:27:56,303 --> 01:27:59,329
It's that nice, young man
from the motor club.

1002
01:27:59,407 --> 01:28:02,706
- Thank you again.
- It's nothing, ladies.

1003
01:28:02,777 --> 01:28:06,178
He's the fastest jack
in Jefferson County.

1004
01:28:08,516 --> 01:28:10,450
What was that all about?

1005
01:28:10,518 --> 01:28:13,544
I really don't know.
They've been hitting on me all night.

1006
01:28:14,422 --> 01:28:15,889
There you are.

1007
01:28:17,758 --> 01:28:21,159
I never thanked you properly
for what you did for Buster.

1008
01:28:21,228 --> 01:28:23,560
He would have choked for sure.

1009
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:27,465
He may have.
He was trying to swallow a whole cow.

1010
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:31,631
- I owe you one, buddy.
- Hang onto him, dear. He's a real find.

1011
01:28:34,508 --> 01:28:38,069
- What did you do today?
- Same old, same old.

1012
01:28:43,718 --> 01:28:45,413
Excuse me.

1013
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:47,420
Fred, how was the wedding?

1014
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:50,685
I just wanted to thank you
for making Debbie go through with it.

1015
01:28:50,791 --> 01:28:53,954
All I did was fan the flame
of her passion for you.

1016
01:28:54,028 --> 01:28:56,588
You are the best.

1017
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:59,929
Rita,
this is Debbie and Fred Kleiser.

1018
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,265
- Here you go, kids. Congratulations.
- What is this?

1019
01:29:03,337 --> 01:29:06,431
No way!

1020
01:29:06,507 --> 01:29:07,974
Wrestlemania!

1021
01:29:10,544 --> 01:29:13,604
How did you know?
We're gonna be in Pittsburgh anyway!

1022
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:17,549
- Thank you! You're a real pal!
- This is the best!

1023
01:29:22,556 --> 01:29:26,356
- I don't understand.
- I guess not.

1024
01:29:26,393 --> 01:29:28,884
How does everyone know you?
You only come here once a year.

1025
01:29:28,963 --> 01:29:31,488
You seem like the most popular person
in town.

1026
01:29:31,565 --> 01:29:33,931
Excuse me. Dr. Connors?

1027
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:36,799
I want to thank you
for fixing Felix's back.

1028
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:39,237
He can even help
around the house again.

1029
01:29:39,306 --> 01:29:41,774
I'm sorry to hear that, Felix.

1030
01:29:44,278 --> 01:29:46,212
"Dr. Connors"?

1031
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:48,840
It's kind of an honorary title.

1032
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:51,680
- What is going on?
- I really don't know.

1033
01:29:51,786 --> 01:29:55,017
There is something
going on with you.

1034
01:29:55,089 --> 01:29:57,182
Would you like the long version
or the short one?

1035
01:29:57,258 --> 01:30:00,022
Let's start with the short
and go from there.

1036
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:08,497
Okay, folks. Attention.

1037
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:11,936
Time for the big bachelor auction.
You all know the rules.

1038
01:30:12,006 --> 01:30:14,440
All the eligible bachelors
come down in front...

1039
01:30:14,508 --> 01:30:17,773
and you ladies bid on them!

1040
01:30:17,878 --> 01:30:21,939
You get to do whatever you want
with them. No questions asked!

1041
01:30:22,016 --> 01:30:25,281
I don't want to know about it,
as long as it's legal!

1042
01:30:25,352 --> 01:30:29,152
Get out your pocketbooks and remember,
it's all for charity!

1043
01:30:32,092 --> 01:30:35,391
What are you doing down here?
Go on. Get up there.

1044
01:30:35,429 --> 01:30:38,956
I got ten bucks that
says you're mine!

1045
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:42,491
- Buster, I got your first victim.
- Come up here!

1046
01:30:48,909 --> 01:30:52,276
All right! What am I bid
for this fine specimen?

1047
01:30:52,346 --> 01:30:53,973
Five dollars!

1048
01:30:54,048 --> 01:30:56,141
The bidding has begun
at five dollars.

1049
01:30:56,217 --> 01:30:59,118
- Ten dollars!
- Fifteen!

1050
01:30:59,186 --> 01:31:01,313
- Twenty!
- Twenty-five!

1051
01:31:01,388 --> 01:31:03,549
- Thirty!
- Thirty-five!

1052
01:31:03,624 --> 01:31:05,649
- Forty!
- Forty-five!

1053
01:31:05,726 --> 01:31:08,593
- Fifty!
- Fifty-five!

1054
01:31:08,662 --> 01:31:11,654
- Sixty!
- I'm bid sixty. Do I hear more?

1055
01:31:15,536 --> 01:31:18,733
Three hundred and thirty-nine dollars
and eighty-eight cents!

1056
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:26,570
We can't accept any more bids.
That's sold...

1057
01:31:26,647 --> 01:31:30,344
to the little lady for $339.88!

1058
01:31:31,418 --> 01:31:32,817
Congratulations.

1059
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:42,828
Okay, bachelors!
Who's next?

1060
01:31:52,907 --> 01:31:56,536
All right!
What am I bid for this guy?

1061
01:31:56,610 --> 01:31:58,601
Do I hear a buck and a half?

1062
01:31:58,679 --> 01:32:00,977
Anybody?

1063
01:32:01,048 --> 01:32:04,074
- Seventy-five cents?
- I bid two bits!

1064
01:32:04,151 --> 01:32:07,086
Sold to the lady
for twenty-five cents!

1065
01:32:07,154 --> 01:32:08,746
I got him!

1066
01:32:17,164 --> 01:32:19,826
Phil Connors!
I thought that was you!

1067
01:32:19,934 --> 01:32:22,630
This is Ned Ryerson,
my new insurance agent.

1068
01:32:22,703 --> 01:32:24,170
I'll say!

1069
01:32:25,239 --> 01:32:27,332
I have not seen this guy
for 20 years.

1070
01:32:27,408 --> 01:32:30,377
He comes to me and buys whole life,
term, uniflex...

1071
01:32:30,411 --> 01:32:32,436
fire, theft, auto,
dental, health...

1072
01:32:32,513 --> 01:32:35,710
with the optional death
and dismemberment plan, water damage.

1073
01:32:35,783 --> 01:32:38,217
This is the best day of my life.

1074
01:32:38,285 --> 01:32:40,446
Mine too.

1075
01:32:40,521 --> 01:32:43,752
- Where are we going?
- Let's not spoil it.

1076
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:48,127
I got that!

1077
01:32:51,131 --> 01:32:54,589
- Why can't I look?
- Because you bother me a lot.

1078
01:32:54,668 --> 01:32:58,160
I'm getting cold.
How much longer do I have to sit here?

1079
01:32:58,238 --> 01:33:01,867
I'm just giving you your money's worth.
You paid top dollar for me.

1080
01:33:01,976 --> 01:33:04,774
I think you were a bargain.

1081
01:33:04,845 --> 01:33:07,746
Sweet of you to say.
You're probably right.

1082
01:33:10,551 --> 01:33:13,213
- Is it finished yet?
- Almost.

1083
01:33:13,287 --> 01:33:17,121
I still have to put cherry syrup on top
and then we can eat it.

1084
01:33:17,191 --> 01:33:19,853
Come on!
I'm freezing!

1085
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:22,794
One second. All right.
Let me turn toward the light.

1086
01:33:29,336 --> 01:33:30,769
It's amazing.

1087
01:33:31,472 --> 01:33:33,406
It's beautiful.

1088
01:33:37,077 --> 01:33:40,911
- How did you do that?
- I know your face so well...

1089
01:33:41,015 --> 01:33:43,074
I could have done it
with my eyes closed.

1090
01:33:47,688 --> 01:33:51,624
It's lovely.
I don't know what to say.

1091
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:54,327
I do.

1092
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:58,564
No matter what happens tomorrow...

1093
01:33:58,632 --> 01:34:00,657
or for the rest of my life...

1094
01:34:00,734 --> 01:34:04,500
I'm happy now
because I love you.

1095
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:08,174
I think I'm happy too.

1096
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:09,295
- Please, not again.
- That is a great song!

1097
01:35:09,369 --> 01:35:10,961
- It's not!
- Don't listen to this man...

1098
01:35:13,173 --> 01:35:15,471
It's too early.

1099
01:35:25,986 --> 01:35:28,386
Something is different.

1100
01:35:28,422 --> 01:35:29,889
Good or bad?

1101
01:35:29,957 --> 01:35:32,448
Anything different is good...

1102
01:35:34,728 --> 01:35:36,889
but this could be real good.

1103
01:35:41,802 --> 01:35:43,736
Why are you here?

1104
01:35:43,804 --> 01:35:46,238
I bought you. I own you.

1105
01:35:48,275 --> 01:35:50,209
But why are you still here?

1106
01:35:50,277 --> 01:35:52,939
You said stay, so I stayed.

1107
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:58,214
I said stay, so you stayed?

1108
01:35:58,285 --> 01:36:00,947
I can't even make a collie stay.

1109
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:05,688
I gotta check something.

1110
01:36:05,759 --> 01:36:07,226
Stay.

1111
01:36:14,201 --> 01:36:15,600
They're gone!

1112
01:36:16,503 --> 01:36:18,562
They're all gone!

1113
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:22,972
- Do you know what today is?
- What?

1114
01:36:24,344 --> 01:36:26,710
Today is tomorrow.

1115
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:28,475
It happened.

1116
01:36:30,417 --> 01:36:32,612
- You're here.
- I'm here.

1117
01:36:36,557 --> 01:36:41,153
Why weren't you like this last night?
You just fell sleep.

1118
01:36:43,363 --> 01:36:45,831
It was the end
of a very long day.

1119
01:36:49,236 --> 01:36:52,831
Is there anything
I can do for you today?

1120
01:36:52,906 --> 01:36:56,273
I'm sure I can think
of something.

1121
01:37:29,643 --> 01:37:31,577
It's so beautiful!

1122
01:37:42,256 --> 01:37:44,156
Let's live here.

1123
01:37:54,368 --> 01:37:56,427
We'll rent to start.
