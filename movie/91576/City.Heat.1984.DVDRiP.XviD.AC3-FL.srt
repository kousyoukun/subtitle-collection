1
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,100
- Evening, lieutenant.
- Louie.

2
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,500
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

3
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,400
Forget it, lieutenant.
Their free refills were killing me anyway.

4
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,400
Mike Murphy been in yet?

5
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,700
- Who?
- Murphy. Michael.

6
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't know him, pal.

7
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,000
That's funny.
I hear he eats here every night.

8
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,200
Murray, you say?

9
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Murphy, brick brain.
Your ears need unplugging?

10
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,900
- So?
- No, he ain't been in yet.

11
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,700
I'll wait.

12
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,900
Damn. Damn.

13
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,800
Hello, Louie.

14
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,500
Got an emergency.
They need your meat loaf down at the river.

15
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,600
The levee's got a hole in it...

16
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,100
...and meat loaf's the only thing
that can stop it up for a year.

17
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,500
Hey.

18
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,000
Somebody left the cage door open, huh?
It's out.

19
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,100
What's the occasion?

20
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,200
Archie, how you doing?

21
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,700
- Not too bad. And you?
- Not too bad.

22
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,600
Good.

23
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,900
- How's the stew?
- Not too good.

24
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,500
That's too bad. I was counting on the stew.
I had my mouth set on it. I'll try the Ritz.

25
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,700
- Maybe not.
- This here is Archie.

26
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,100
Really? Ain't that peculiar?

27
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,400
- What?
- See, Archie...

28
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,100
...we're looking for a gumshoe
named Mike Murphy.

29
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,300
Guy about your size
with a mustache like you.

30
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,000
Even drives a Model A Roadster like you,
with the same license plate too.

31
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:13,400
- Now, ain't that peculiar?
- Yeah, that's peculiar.

32
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,300
They're a couple of cupcakes.

33
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,000
I guess this wouldn't work again.

34
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,500
Oh, Speer.

35
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,000
Lieutenant, aren't you gonna do anything?

36
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,900
How about a refill?

37
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
He can take care of himself.

38
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,100
I'm not disturbing you, am I?
I got a situation here.

39
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,100
I know we're not really close
anymore, but let by--

40
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,400
- You back?
- Fuck, yes, I'm back.

41
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,500
You know why I'm back?
Because I'm being killed.

42
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,600
What are you gawking at?

43
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,100
- You waiting for them to kill me?
- They competitors?

44
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,000
Or did you have your nose
in the wrong ass?

45
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,200
- There's plenty left for you.
- Say when.

46
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,800
Mike, please.
There's not much left.

47
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,100
- Anytime, Speer.
- Until then, you watch your step.

48
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,700
- You hear me?
- What are you talking about?

49
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,400
I'm talking about rumors
of a frayed-collar peeper...

50
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,100
...trying to get in bed
with the wrong snot balls.

51
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,900
Of course, that wouldn't be you.
You're too much of a fancy Dan.

52
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,600
So?

53
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,300
- I'll be watching.
- I'm shaking.

54
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,300
So long, shorty.

55
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,600
You pathetic son of a bitch.

56
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,100
He's so pathetic.
I turned in my badge, you know.

57
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,500
I got my own--
I got my own office now!

58
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,600
I got my name in gold.
You're just jealous.

59
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,800
You're so insecure, it's unbelievable.

60
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,700
Is this frayed?

61
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
How you doing, boss?

62
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,600
- Fine, fine, doing fine.
- Alrighty.

63
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,400
- Keep the change.
- Thanks a million. Much obliged.

64
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,500
The finance company just called.
Those mugs last night were after your car.

65
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,300
Repo guys?

66
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,500
Seems they don't enjoy their work
as much as they used to.

67
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,400
You owe $98.98, Mike.
It's the cash or the keys.

68
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Mahoney.

69
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,200
- Who?
- The landlord.

70
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,100
Do I have to do everything?
I told you to send that check weeks ago.

71
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,700
- Oh, my gosh!
- I can't stand irresponsibility.

72
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,200
I know. I'm so--

73
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,300
Still singing that song?
Ain't never worked. Ain't never gonna work.

74
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,000
You remember my silent
and invisible partner, Mr. Swift.

75
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,100
We thought you were Mahoney...

76
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,300
...president of the Landlord's
Malevolent Association.

77
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,000
- Behind in our rent again.
- The word is "still."

78
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,400
Tell Mr. Mahoney to fix the plumbing,
or we're gonna move to a better dump.

79
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,800
Mike, catch me. I'm gonna faint.

80
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,100
I suppose Murphy and Swift are financially
delinquent with regards to their secretary.

81
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,900
- Somewhat.
- One week, two weeks?

82
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,900
- Three.
- For shame.

83
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,800
- Months.
- Oh, now that's what I call loyalty.

84
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,800
And a little bonus. How's that?

85
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Addy, take a letter somewhere.

86
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,100
Yes, sir, Mr. Murphy. Sir.

87
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,500
Yes.

88
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,200
Free Spirit in the seventh.

89
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,700
You've never been that lucky,
and you ain't that smart.

90
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,100
- People change.
- Not you.

91
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,100
I heard a rumor about you last night.

92
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,100
Taletelling, Mike?

93
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,200
- I didn't figure you were the type.
- Snot balls play hard.

94
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,500
It warms my cockles knowing you care.

95
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,200
You're not that good, Dehl.

96
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,700
Hello. Hey, sugar.
Fine.

97
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,600
Tonight at 8?
Okay. Bye-bye.

98
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,000
Gotta breeze, Mike.

99
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,700
Promises to keep and all.

100
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,700
Oh, by the way...

101
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,100
...don't be surprised if you receive
a little bonus soon.

102
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,800
Why would that happen?

103
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,800
Maybe because you're the only guy around
who's got trouble telling dark from light.

104
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,300
- Take care of yourself.
- Oh, yeah.

105
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,200
Don't spend it all in one place.

106
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,800
I won't even ask.

107
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,800
- I appreciate that.
- Here.

108
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,300
That's your bonus.

109
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,400
I'm investing in the company.
Can't do much detecting without a car.

110
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,500
Addy...

111
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,800
...thank you.

112
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,700
I'll see you.

113
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,100
It's all arranged.

114
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,500
- You must not give it to Pitt before I've gone.
- Tomorrow night.

115
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,500
Ginny, baby.

116
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,600
If it's worth 25, 000 to Primo Pitt,
then it's worth twice that much to Leon Coll.

117
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,300
- Dehl.
- Why not?

118
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
- You know why not. If you double-cross Pitt--
- I got protection from Coll.

119
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,300
Now listen, when you finish here,
meet me back at my place, okay?

120
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,600
Dehl?

121
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,700
Please don't do this.

122
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:30,200
Come on, baby, stop worrying. In 48 hours,
you'll have everything you ever wanted.

123
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,000
Hey, sugar, cheer up.
There ain't nothing left but the good times.

124
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,900
Hello?

125
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,900
- Mike?
- Hello, sweetness.

126
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,400
Guess what I'm doing.

127
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,500
From the sound, you're either
making gin or taking a bath.

128
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,400
Lying there all warm and soapy,
watching your pores open up.

129
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,200
I could help. Come right over
and get those hard to reach places.

130
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,500
Actually, I'm making a list for this party
I'm giving. Would you come?

131
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,800
Please? I need cheering up.

132
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,600
And I haven't smiled since last Tuesday.
Do you remember Tuesday?

133
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
- Was it raining?
- Yes, it was.

134
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,700
Maybe I'm confused.
Maybe you were....

135
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,000
Monday. Yeah, or Sunday. Yeah.

136
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,900
- Sunday was nice.
- You bitch, I was with you Sunday...

137
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,100
...and Monday and Tuesday
and Wednesday.

138
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,000
- Well, what happened to Thursday?
- Thursday I was in traction.

139
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,100
Do you want to be Friday?
Come to my party.

140
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,300
- I might be late.
- Oh, early is boring.

141
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,400
That's why I like you so much,
because you're always so late.

142
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,900
- How about I come over and be late now?
- I've too much to do.

143
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,400
Just come to my party.

144
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,300
Maybe.

145
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Good night, luscious.

146
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:00,000
Okay, I'll come over and buff your body
and bring a nice glow to your cheeks.

147
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,600
I'll bring a nice foot to your ass.

148
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:09,100
- Who dialed the phone for you, Speer?
- I've been hearing that rumor again.

149
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,800
- Once is a pain in the ass, twice is a bore.
- Once is all you get, pal.

150
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,100
I'm tired, Speer. Why don't you save
the patter for the pulp reporters?

151
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,400
There's a good card at the arena tonight,
and I'm holding two tickets.

152
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,100
- You think l'd go to the fights with you?
- Who invited you?

153
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:31,800
- I'm calling you for Addy's number.
- Not a chance. I like the girl too much.

154
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,700
- See you around, shorty.
- Not if I see your mug first, flatfoot.

155
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,200
Go for the eye!

156
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,100
Thanks for the invite, lieutenant.
I like the fights.

157
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,800
No, honest, I really do.

158
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:28,600
I love watching two sweaty, sinewy,
nearly-naked guys bounce each other around.

159
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,600
Raises all my prurient interests.

160
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,900
Well, that's great. You don't have to be
so formal. Why don't you call me "Speer"?

161
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,600
Come on. Go. Go.

162
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,600
Come on!

163
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,800
Way to go.

164
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:19,000
Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine.

165
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,600
Ten. You're out.

166
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,700
- A toast.
- A toast.

167
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,500
- Where you going?
- One more picture over here.

168
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,000
Better be good, sunshine.

169
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,400
Name's not "Sunshine,"
and it's 50, 000 good.

170
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,300
Fifty thousand?

171
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,800
- I don't like clowns, sunshine.
- Told you, my name is not "Sunshine."

172
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,400
- Spit it out or you're a memory.
- How does "bookkeeper" strike you, huh?

173
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,000
- What about him?
- He sold you out.

174
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,600
- To who?
- Primo Pitt for 25 big ones.

175
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,000
- What did he sell?
- A cleaver big enough to cut yours clean off.

176
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,000
Yeah.

177
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,100
Pitt got the stuff?

178
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,800
Not yet.

179
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,400
- But you'll get it back.
- Oh, yeah.

180
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,600
For 50, 000. Half now, half on delivery.

181
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,100
Don't got that much on me.

182
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,000
Tell you what. The bookkeeper does.

183
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,300
On the river. Pier 14,
Star of Bolivia.

184
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,700
Just have one of your mutts
drop it at my place.

185
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,400
- And the goods?
- Don't worry, you'll hear.

186
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,800
- Dehl. Dehl.
- Yeah?

187
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,900
Cross me and you're snail food.

188
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,800
This is crummy, Speer.

189
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,600
I better check this out.
It may be for his own good.

190
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,500
Look what the rat dragged in.

191
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,600
Sugar, it's all gonna be fine.

192
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,500
What kind of game are you playing, Pitt?

193
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,400
Did you have a good time at the fight?

194
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,900
- Wasn't nothing.
- Maybe not.

195
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,700
You're in a lot of trouble, shoe fly.
Open that case.

196
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,200
Open the case.

197
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,200
Run!

198
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,800
Get her!

199
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,600
Stay there.

200
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,800
Jesus!

201
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Come on! Come on! Come on!

202
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:38,800
- Everything all right?
- All right for me, not so good for him.

203
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,200
- He took a four-story fall.
- Fall?

204
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,900
- He had help.
- Bastards.

205
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,600
- Didn't know you two were so close.
- He was my partner.

206
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,000
That's right, he was.

207
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:59,800
We dug two .38s and a .45 out of the walls,
a 9 mm out of the ceiling.

208
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,800
Now this in here was chasing Ginny Lee
when I bumped into him.

209
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:09,800
- She got away.
- Vint Diestock, one of Pitt's soldiers.

210
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,700
Dehl's gun was in his holster.

211
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,100
- What'd you do with Addy?
- I sent her home in a patrol car.

212
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,300
Boy, you really know how to show
a girl a good time, Speer.

213
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,600
Mr. Coll wants to see you.

214
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,700
Hard or easy, Murphy?

215
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,900
Mr. Murphy.

216
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,900
- Mr. Coll.
- Well, I'm so glad you could come.

217
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,000
- Make yourself comfortable. Want a drink?
- No, thanks.

218
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,800
Swell-looking joint you got here.

219
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,200
- Fruits of my labor.
- Yeah.

220
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,800
Don't tell me why you asked me up here.
Let me guess.

221
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,400
You're a night kind of guy.
You like to invite new friends up.

222
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,100
Chew the rag a little bit.
What do you want to gab about, fish face?

223
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,500
- I saw your late partner tonight.
- Oh, yeah?

224
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:51,300
Was that about 1:00 when he tried to fly out
of the fourth-floor window without wings?

225
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,300
- You know I didn't dust him.
- How do I know that?

226
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,100
Because you remember all about Mr. Pitt,
don't you?

227
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,900
Oh, yeah. Primo Pitt. Hell of a guy.

228
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,900
He came in second to you
in the snot-ball pageant.

229
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,800
- You're close to a manners lesson.
- You're close to getting your ass kicked.

230
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,200
- You want some of me, pal? Come on.
- Not now.

231
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,400
Where do you stand, Murphy?

232
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,600
You and Dehl, you had a fix
with Mr. Pitt, right?

233
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
So, Dehl, he pulls a double-cross.

234
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,200
Now, you in with him
or he's screwing you too?

235
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,000
He was my partner.

236
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:45,800
- He couldn't cut it. Can you?
- He was my junior partner.

237
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,000
I taught him practically nothing
of what I know.

238
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,900
So you'll get my goods back for me, then?

239
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:01,100
Well, I didn't talk to Dehl
before he went out for some air.

240
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,000
I don't know the financial arrangement.

241
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,000
This now,
another like it when I take possession.

242
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,700
Fifty thousand or forget it.

243
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,100
Agreed.

244
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,100
Good. Tell the little rodents
to fix me a drink, will you?

245
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,900
Two.

246
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,400
Wait till you see the bedroom.

247
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,000
When was the last time
you talked to Primo Pitt?

248
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,700
I've never talked to Primo Pitt.

249
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,100
Well, two of his guns are parked
right across the street.

250
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,400
- Cadillac?
- Yeah.

251
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,900
You rate the heavy artillery.

252
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,500
Maybe they're waiting for you.
Did you ever think of that?

253
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,500
I ducked in the alley,
came up the back.

254
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,000
What are you drinking?

255
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,800
Tea. I found it in the bottle
under the sink.

256
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,900
Or what's left of your sink.
It tastes like gin.

257
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,700
It is gin, my gin.

258
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,800
You didn't sly up here
just to prove you're stealthy.

259
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,000
We fished Aram Strossell
out of the river today.

260
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,100
- Leon Coll's bookkeeper.
- A friend of yours?

261
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,600
He was gonna do my taxes next year.

262
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,300
He was wired to a cement block.
The wire broke, and he popped up...

263
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,100
...in front of a seafood restaurant,
much to the chagrin of the customers.

264
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:28,200
- Catch of the day.
- Very funny.

265
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Want to quote me odds on the connection
between Dehl and the bookkeeper?

266
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,900
Or the link between you and them?

267
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,700
They dug a slug out of the mess
that was left of Dehl.

268
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,700
It was a 9 mm.

269
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,600
One of those wouldn't be too good
for your looks either, shorty.

270
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,500
Duck.

271
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,000
That's right.

272
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,800
- Yeah?
- Roll it down further.

273
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,400
It's against the law
to lie down in the street.

274
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,500
- I never laid down on the street.
- Sure you did. You were hit by a truck.

275
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,700
- What truck?
- Next one that comes along.

276
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,800
- Look, lieutenant--
- No, you look. I don't like sludge like you.

277
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,300
In fact, it wouldn't break my heart at all
to scrape the street clean of your ilk.

278
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,700
- You know what an "ilk" is, don't you, Dub?
- A big deer.

279
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,000
Yeah. Now, if I catch you loitering
around my precinct again...

280
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,400
...I'm gonna shoot me an ilk.
You understand?

281
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,300
All right, throw your cannons
out the window.

282
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,200
Come on, I hear a truck coming.

283
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,700
Good boy.

284
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,200
Pretty stealthy, lieutenant.
Pretty stealthy.

285
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,400
- Hello, Tuck. How you feeling?
- Good.

286
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,200
Getting plenty of raw meat, are you?
That's good.

287
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,600
- Say, "The Leith police dismisseth us."
- What?

288
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,100
- It's a test they give radio announcers.
- What?

289
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,300
- You don't wanna be a radio announcer?
- No.

290
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,900
- Ç'est la vie, Tuck.
- Yeah.

291
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,200
- Hello, Freddie.
- Well, Murph.

292
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,200
- Care for a taste?
- I'm full of tea.

293
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,600
You're supposed to flush that,
not smoke it.

294
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,600
Now, don't razz my ass, Mike.
I'm low.

295
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,900
- Why?
- Ginny.

296
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,000
I do some fine coin with her singing.

297
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,200
She hits them notes real nice.

298
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,800
You worried about business,
Freddie?

299
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:12,200
What the hell, Mike,
I never could jive you.

300
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,300
I'm worried about her.

301
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,300
Last night when Dehl was dumped,
he was here, wasn't he?

302
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,400
He came here about 8:00
to see Ginny?

303
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,400
Yeah. Ginny and the bookkeeper.

304
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,700
Thanks a lot, Freddie.
And kill those before they kill you.

305
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,200
- It's black tie, sir.
- Thank God I've got one.

306
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,800
Everybody's going.
Pres, Buffy, Boo, Binky, everyone.

307
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,600
- Well, just pull it out.
- Yes.

308
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,700
I love it when you talk that way.

309
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,700
He'll never know the difference if I--
Oh, Mike! Finally!

310
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,400
- Keith, this is Michael Twitchell Murphy.
- Hi.

311
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,100
- Where does the "Twitchell" come from?
- The milkman.

312
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,000
- Mike, this is Keith Stoddard, Esq.
- Where's the "esquire" come from?

313
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,600
- Mama the heiress or Papa the pirate?
- Oh, Mike.

314
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,600
- How'd you like to step outside, smart guy?
- Oh, I don't think so.

315
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,800
See, I'm gonna go upstairs and try to put
a twinkle in both of Caroline's eyes.

316
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,500
If I'm not too tired afterwards, though,
I'll come down and pop your face inside out.

317
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,400
Good night, Keith.

318
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,000
I don't know how you got in,
but you're not gonna get out so easy.

319
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:05,200
Well, maybe I'll use you as a shield, blind
those goons of yours with your jammies.

320
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,800
What do you want?

321
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,800
They picked a 9 mm slug
out of Dehl Swift.

322
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:14,300
- What's a Dehl Swift?
- You won't mind if I take this for ballistics?

323
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,400
You're not gonna take this gun
without a warrant.

324
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,800
I wasn't planning to.

325
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,900
Oh, Mother!
Jesus!

326
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,100
Just want the bullet.

327
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,200
I'm kind of scared, Mike.

328
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,000
Lt'll be light soon.

329
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,100
I'm falling in love with you, Murphy.

330
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:50,000
Real love.
And it scares me.

331
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,700
I know what you mean.

332
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,200
Say that again.

333
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,800
Well, I should be running.
It's getting a little late, you know?

334
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,900
You son of a bitch!

335
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,100
- You can't say it, can you?
- What?

336
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,000
You tried, but you couldn't,
you big palooka!

337
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,200
Where you going?

338
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,700
I pour my heart out, and you put
your pants on. You dope!

339
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,400
Big palooka-dope!

340
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,800
Son of a bitch!

341
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,700
Morning, angel.

342
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,600
This just came.

343
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,300
- It's addressed to Dehl.
- Ln his own handwriting.

344
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,200
Oh, yeah?

345
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,100
- "Majestic Pawnshop."
- This is it, boss.

346
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,700
I see that.

347
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:59,500
So after you go to the beauty shop,
you could pick up my laundry?

348
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,500
Primo Pitt. Somebody kicked over
the rock you live under...

349
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,600
...and you had to crawl out
into the sunshine.

350
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,200
Scram.

351
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,400
- Your partner crossed me.
- Really? That's a shame.

352
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,600
His squeeze or you
has got something I want.

353
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,800
What could that be?
I know.

354
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:36,000
The address
of a good plastic surgeon.

355
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,300
He's a funny man.

356
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,600
Don't matter who's got it.
You're gonna hand it over.

357
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,900
- Why would I do that?
- Because I got something you want.

358
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,200
The only thing I want
is to see your ass walk out of here.

359
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,700
Phone's ringing.

360
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,400
- Yeah?
- Mike?

361
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,600
- I've been kidnapped.
- Where are you?

362
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,000
This is ridiculous!
What's going on?

363
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,500
- You okay?
- Hell, no!

364
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:24,000
My hair's a mess.
I broke two of my fingernails.

365
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,800
I don't have my makeup.

366
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:31,400
And I'm stuck here with these
two ugly, smelly garbage cans!

367
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,300
Caroline.

368
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,500
Caroline!

369
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,000
You son of a bitch!

370
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,500
All right.

371
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,200
I'll give you whatever you want.
Let her go.

372
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:00,300
She walks when I hold the goods.

373
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,800
Come on.

374
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,500
Did you tab that .45 yet?

375
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,100
How about the 9 mm?

376
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,700
They match?

377
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,500
Good.

378
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:41,100
Croix de Guerre.
French medal of honor.

379
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,200
When Dehl was good,
he was very, very good.

380
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,900
Pretty fancy for the bottom
of a Cracker Jack box.

381
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:53,800
- I didn't hear you knock.
- What a relief. I thought I was going deaf.

382
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,400
What do you want, Speer?

383
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:02,300
We ID'd the .45, the 9 mm.
Dub Slack and Primo Pitt.

384
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:08,300
- Is it enough to nail them?
- Not with their alibi. We need an eyewitness.

385
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,300
That's why you will tell me
when you find Ginny Lee, right?

386
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,800
- What makes you think I'm after Ginny?
- Questions you're asking.

387
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,900
- The places you're asking them.
- Always pushing people around, aren't you?

388
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,200
Always on the prod.

389
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,400
- That's how you do the job, remember?
- You're damn right I remember.

390
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:30,800
Okay, guys. No clinches, no rabbit punches
and please, no hitting below the belt.

391
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,500
Now shake hands, and at the sound
of the bell, come out slugging.

392
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,800
Anything to drink around here?

393
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:42,100
We're out of tea. There's some
furniture polish under the sink.

394
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,100
I'll get it.

395
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,600
Why do you both go at each other so hard?
Do you enjoy it?

396
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,800
Yeah.

397
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,500
Hello?

398
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,100
Hello?

399
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,800
Hello?

400
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:08,000
- One more time and I hang up.
- Mike?

401
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,800
- Who is this?
- It's me, Ginny Lee.

402
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,000
You all right, kid?
Where are you?

403
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,100
Mike, I got trouble.
Can you meet me?

404
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:19,200
- Where?
- The park. You know, the pavilion?

405
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,400
When?

406
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,100
When?

407
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,400
Sick friend.

408
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,500
Mike had to take off.

409
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,600
- He's good at that.
- Yeah.

410
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,000
- Care for a drink?
- Sure, why not?

411
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,500
Thanks, lieutenant.

412
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,700
- Really is furniture polish.
- Yeah.

413
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:03,200
Shocking what Prohibition
forces people to drink.

414
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,400
So we're back to lieutenant, huh?

415
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,500
- It's what you are, right?
- Yeah.

416
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:14,300
First, last, always,
seven days a week, 24 hours a day.

417
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,100
Look, I'm sorry about the other night.
That wasn't too good.

418
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:22,200
Forget about it.

419
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,300
I better go.

420
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,600
- What?
- I've gotta go.

421
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:34,100
- Someday I'll figure it out.
- What?

422
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:39,000
Mike's not the only one around here
who's good at taking off.

423
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:41,500
Caroline Howley, the society twist.

424
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:47,300
Pitt took a hell of a chance
kidnapping Randolph Howley's daughter.

425
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,100
He must expect big things
from Mr. Murphy.

426
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,100
Like the bookkeeper's merchandise?

427
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,400
It's time we had another meet
with Mr. Murphy.

428
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,000
Come back for me in five minutes.

429
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,000
Hike!

430
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,600
Fancy seeing you here.
Well, it's a small world after all.

431
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,300
Hike!

432
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,300
Just leave me alone.

433
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,300
You really should be nice to me.
You belong in the back, you know.

434
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,700
Why don't you get
the hell out of here, huh?

435
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,600
- Now.
- Why weren't you in that last scrimmage?

436
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,000
I waited in the park for two hours, kid.

437
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,000
I'm sorry, Mike.

438
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,000
I had to be sure.

439
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,600
Are you sure?

440
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,800
I don't know.

441
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,700
I don't know anything anymore.

442
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,200
They killed Dehl.

443
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,000
I know.

444
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,800
You're a witness.
They're gonna try to kill you too.

445
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,800
Sweet Jesus!
What am I supposed to do?

446
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,900
- You can call Speer.
- Oh, God. Mike, I can't do that.

447
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,600
I know he's a bastard, but he's straight.
He's good at his job too.

448
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,900
He'll keep you safe.

449
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:24,100
You can put Pitt at the scene of a murder.
Don't you understand?

450
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:30,900
- He'll kill me if I go to Speer.
- He'll kill you if you--

451
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,200
He'll kill you if you don't.

452
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:39,400
Either way, Ginny Lee Lewis is....

453
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,300
Where are the bookkeeper's goods?
Where is it?

454
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,100
- I don't know.
- Pitt says you do.

455
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,400
I don't. I swear I don't.

456
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:53,100
Dehl made-- He made
some kind of a switch.

457
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:56,300
Yeah, he was good at that.

458
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,000
Always chasing rainbows.

459
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:06,700
Ginny, did you ever see this key before?

460
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,800
No.

461
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,900
Damn.

462
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:16,600
Did he say anything new?
Talk about anything different?

463
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:23,400
He was talking about getting into shape.

464
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,500
He said he was playing handball.
I don't know.

465
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,700
Where?

466
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,200
Somewhere near his place.

467
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:37,800
All right, I'm gonna go now, kid.

468
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,300
It's gonna be okay.

469
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,100
Call Speer.

470
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,800
Hey, you're running the wrong way.

471
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,000
- Evening.
- Yeah.

472
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:48,600
Boy, it's so cold tonight
it makes you want to be a boilermaker.

473
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,500
And how the hell would you know?

474
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:57,800
Because I was pounding a beat
when you were still peeing your pants.

475
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,200
I used to freeze my ass off
right on the same street.

476
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:06,100
So many times I thought about becoming
a boilermaker. See, I was a hotshot like you.

477
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,200
Didn't have any respect for the badge
or the uniform.

478
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,700
I got my own business now.
Know what I'm doing?

479
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:19,300
I'm still freezing my ass off and taking a lot
of flack from a snot-nosed rookie like you.

480
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:23,600
- I'm sorry.
- Ain't we all.

481
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,700
- You know 10th Street?
- Used to be my beat.

482
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:31,800
Are there any athletic clubs around there?

483
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,500
- Gymnasiums?
- Yeah, Riverside Athletic on Broad Street.

484
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,200
Thanks.

485
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,200
Anytime.

486
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,500
Oh, lieutenant, I didn't see you.

487
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,500
Muldoon.

488
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,000
Excuse me.

489
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,700
Oh, my God!

490
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,200
- Where's the locker room?
- It's over there.

491
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,500
Thanks.

492
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:44,800
Get on the heavy bag.

493
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,600
Hey, buddy. Can I help you?

494
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,900
Yeah, I wanna see Dehl Swift's locker.

495
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,900
- Yeah, why?
- I'm here to pick up his stuff.

496
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:03,900
I can't let you in his locker
without his permission.

497
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:06,700
That'll be a little tough.
He's dead.

498
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:10,200
I'm the executor of his estate.

499
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:15,100
- How did he die?
- Suddenly.

500
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:21,500
Well, there's his locker right here, 628.

501
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,300
Thank you.

502
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,100
Yeah, okay.

503
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,300
- Lt. Speer?
- Yeah.

504
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:47,200
- I'm Dr. Breslin.
- Doc, how is she?

505
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:50,000
She fractured the radius and ulna
on her left arm...

506
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:54,000
...cracked the 10th, 11th and 12th ribs
on her left side and banged her head.

507
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,500
That could mean a concussion.
So we're gonna watch her for a few days.

508
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:00,900
- Can I talk to her?
- Maybe tomorrow.

509
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,700
Addy!

510
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:33,600
I got it!
I got a feeling I got it!

511
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,700
You know how I am when I got a feeling.

512
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,200
This is what got Strossell
and Dehl killed.

513
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,100
Mike.

514
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,100
It's a dull knife anyway.

515
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:01,000
Holy mackerel!

516
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,300
I had no idea Dehl was in so deep.

517
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:10,700
This could put Coll away forever
and change Pitt from Mr. Two to Mr. One.

518
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:14,800
- Mike. Got some bad news.
- What?

519
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:17,900
- Caroline's been kidnapped.
- How'd you find out?

520
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Just heard it on the radio.
You know?

521
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:22,900
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

522
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:25,500
- And that's not all.
- What?

523
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,000
- Ginny Lee's in City General.
- What?

524
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,000
Speer called, said she was hit by a car.

525
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,900
No.

526
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:36,700
- Guess I'll go home?
- No! No, no, no, stay.

527
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,600
Furniture polish.

528
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:04,000
- Better call Fat Freddie, tell him about Ginny.
- I already did.

529
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,900
You do good work, kid.

530
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,200
- Hello?
- This is Pitt.

531
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,700
I was just on my way over
to see you, Mr. Pitt.

532
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:26,500
- I have the goods.
- You better not double-cross me.

533
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:29,100
Why would I do
a stupid-ass thing like that?

534
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:33,600
- You do, and she's dead.
- I told you, I'll bring you the goods.

535
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,900
She better be okay.

536
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:43,300
You don't hear from me by morning,
tell your friend, the cop...

537
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:46,700
...to drag the river with a magnet.

538
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,700
Mike.

539
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,500
I know, kid.

540
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,300
Doesn't anybody knock anymore?

541
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,000
Now, Addy!

542
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:31,900
Got it.

543
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:38,200
Help.

544
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,000
No.

545
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,100
- I'm covered in gasoline.
- What?

546
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:23,000
- I'm covered in goddamn gasoline!
- Stay the hell away from me.

547
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Oh, I've been doing it all wrong.
I've been hiding.

548
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:59,000
You just walk down
the middle of the street, huh?

549
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:02,400
Two guys down there on the right,
and two guys on the left.

550
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,600
There's four guys down there altogether.

551
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,300
Oh, no.

552
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,800
Hey!

553
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,800
We did all right, huh?
What a team.

554
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,900
I start off slow,
but I had to set them up for you.

555
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,400
Don't tell me why you hit me.
Let me guess.

556
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,600
They took the tire out of your cage,
and you're peeved.

557
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:42,300
You said you'd tell me
when you found Ginny Lee.

558
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,900
- I don't give a damn--
- Where you going?

559
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,300
I got things to do and places to go, pal.

560
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,300
- You're under arrest.
- For what?

561
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,500
For obstructing justice,
assaulting a police officer...

562
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:55,500
...disturbing the peace
and anything else I can think of.

563
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,900
They got Caroline.

564
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:01,100
- Who?
- Pitt.

565
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:06,200
Let me go. I'll wrap it up in a neat package
and give it to you, all right?

566
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:08,500
What do you say?

567
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:17,300
- Get out of here.
- I appreciate that. I really appreciate that.

568
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,300
Next time I see you, I'll hit you so hard,
I'll knock you...

569
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,900
...into the Stone Age,
where you came from.

570
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:42,500
- Hello.
- You okay?

571
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,800
Come on, I'll give you a ride home.

572
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,500
- Ln a cop car?
- My cop car.

573
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:52,600
That would be nice, Speer.
Real nice.

574
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:56,900
How come you're not married?

575
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,800
- How come you're not?
- I don't know.

576
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,900
Lots of reasons.

577
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,200
Why do you and Mike
go at each other so hard?

578
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,400
I don't know. Lots of reasons.

579
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:34,000
Five card draw.

580
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,200
Keep your shirt on.

581
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:52,700
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

582
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:01,900
- Hi.
- Why did you bust my door?

583
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:05,700
Nobody knocks anymore.
Haven't you heard?

584
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,400
- You're nuts, Murphy.
- Where is she?

585
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,600
Not here.

586
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,300
Not till I know she's safe.

587
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,100
Exterminate this pest.

588
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:18,300
Don't you want to know
what's in the case?

589
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:23,700
- Hold it! I know what better be in there.
- Oh, that's in there.

590
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:30,200
- I think you just said goodbye.
- And a little surprise just for you.

591
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,700
- What?
- Dynamite.

592
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,000
Dynamite?

593
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:38,900
Enough to blow this garage
right over to the wealthy section of town.

594
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:41,400
You're bluffing.

595
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:46,200
I relax my grip and we go boom!

596
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:51,600
- Blast him.
- We shoot him, boss, he relaxes.

597
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,200
Give me that.

598
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,200
I'm calling your bluff.

599
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:05,200
- I hope you like loud noises.
- Evening, gents.

600
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,600
Shorty.

601
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:17,300
Hi.

602
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,500
Is this a private party
or can anybody attend?

603
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:24,300
- I thought you were gonna sit this one out?
- I lied.

604
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,600
What are you pointing the gun
at the suitcase for? It's dead already.

605
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,500
Oh, what if I shoot me a live cop?

606
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:35,300
Well, that'd give the 20 officers
I have outside just cause.

607
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:37,500
Check it out.

608
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,100
- Hey!
- I gotta go to the bathroom.

609
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,500
You stay where you are.

610
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:47,900
Twenty cops. You're as nuts as him.

611
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:51,400
We're nuts? He's the one
who's got the drop on the luggage.

612
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,600
It's all that corruption.
It corrodes their brains.

613
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:59,000
- He says it's full of dynamite.
- Is it?

614
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:03,900
Well, two sticks of dynamite
and a hand grenade.

615
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:06,400
What were you gonna do
after you dropped it?

616
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:09,800
- I don't know, Ollie.
- I really should go to the bathroom.

617
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,300
- Pee in your pants.
- I did that.

618
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:17,200
Nobody out there
but an old man walking his dog.

619
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,400
Two dead wise guys.

620
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,700
Well, that old man is Sgt. Lefkowitz.

621
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,900
Who's the guy in the dog suit?

622
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,300
That's Connors.
You remember him.

623
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,800
Right. Short legs,
long tongue, pants a lot.

624
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,800
Okay, give me the case.

625
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:39,500
- Give it to him.
- You got it.

626
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,000
- I'm out of here.
- Get up!

627
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:13,500
Help!

628
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:22,400
You shot Pitt. You killed him,
you big dummy.

629
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,500
What were you shooting at me for?

630
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:26,900
- You were shooting at Pitt.
- He was shooting at you.

631
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:30,300
I wasn't shooting at you.
I was trying to distract you.

632
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,400
Some difference.

633
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:40,200
Where's Caroline?

634
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,300
What time is it?

635
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:47,200
What the hell difference does that make
to you now? A little after 1.

636
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:51,800
Two o'clock, I don't call,
she don't breath no more.

637
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:55,500
This ain't so bad.

638
01:16:55,600 --> 01:17:00,200
You get to watch me die,
I get to watch you squirm.

639
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:15,400
- Now how do we find Caroline?
- Dub and Nino.

640
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,700
What does "Dub and Nino" mean,
you closed-mouth son of a--

641
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:27,600
- Make that Dub.
- That's just terrific. Just goddamn terrific.

642
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:32,000
I figured somebody had to go down.
Better him than you. Maybe I was wrong.

643
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,900
How we gonna find Caroline
if you shoot the bums...

644
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:37,700
- ...that'll tell us where she is?
- We'll get Dub.

645
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,100
Where we gonna get Dub?

646
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:42,100
Where would you go
if you had an ass load of buckshot?

647
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:44,100
- Doc Loomis.
- Now you're thinking.

648
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,700
Don't kill anybody.
Let me say this to you one more time.

649
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:49,800
Do not kill anybody. Do me a favor,
don't save my life anymore.

650
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,500
My pleasure.

651
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:57,000
Speer! It's about time.

652
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
She's a pal of the cop's too.

653
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:07,400
We came looking for answers,
but maybe we found some insurance too.

654
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:12,100
You know, this is gonna hurt.

655
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:16,000
- Maybe I should give you some ether.
- No ether.

656
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:19,800
Okay, but there's no reason
both of us should suffer.

657
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,600
- Just get it over with.
- Patience, Dub.

658
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,900
- Where's the girl?
- What girl?

659
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:34,100
After you get the information,
then you can kill him.

660
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:37,000
- How you been keeping?
- Not too bad. How about you?

661
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:40,600
- Not too bad.
- That's good.

662
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,200
Last chance, Dub.

663
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:49,600
I don't know what you're talking about.

664
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,500
No!

665
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:02,200
No! No! You crazy!

666
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:07,200
Yeah?

667
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:09,800
They still together?

668
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,600
Murphy's still got the goods?

669
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,100
Right.

670
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,800
Let me guess.
We're going for a little ride.

671
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,300
Look, if it's all the same to you fellas,
I think I'll just take the trolley.

672
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:25,200
Didn't have any tokens anyway.

673
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:56,200
Hi.

674
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,800
- Your coat, sir?
- Thank you.

675
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,300
- How are you?
- Fine.

676
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,100
Good to see you.

677
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Gentlemen!

678
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:08,000
Peg, I want to have you meet my friend
Mr. Smith from St. Louis.

679
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,400
- Oh, come right in, Mr. Smith.
- Thanks.

680
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,900
We have quite a few
of your relatives here tonight.

681
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:17,000
- Your 20 and 100.
- A hundred?

682
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:18,900
- I haven't got that much.
- I win.

683
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:21,700
- The hell you do.
- That ain't the way you play.

684
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,000
- It's table stakes.
- Whatever I got in front of me.

685
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:28,900
And I got 20, 30, 35, 37,
and you're called. What do you got?

686
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:31,400
A straight.

687
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,300
Full house.

688
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,800
All diamonds.

689
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,800
There's a guy on the roof.

690
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,600
Man in the doorway.

691
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:05,500
Okay, now, we're not going to shoot anybody
until we know Caroline's all right.

692
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,500
Right?

693
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:10,800
Right.

694
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:19,800
Seven card stud,
deuces and one-eyed jacks wild.

695
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
For Pete's sake!

696
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:35,000
- Is this the place, Ollie?
- That's right, Stanley.

697
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,500
Where do you two rum-dums
think you're going?

698
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:40,600
- Is this the public library?
- Look, pal--

699
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:04,800
All right, what now?

700
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,700
You can go up and take out
the goon on the roof.

701
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:09,400
Why do I go up on the roof?

702
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,500
Because I'm stealthy. That means
you've gotta be agile. Right, shorty?

703
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:18,000
Listen, ape face, after this is over,
I'm gonna show you how agile I am.

704
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:22,800
- You name the time.
- I'll see you inside.

705
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:27,800
Hey, Speer? Let's not kill anybody
until we get Caroline, okay?

706
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:52,700
- What is this?
- Police business. Take her around the block.

707
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,300
Get your clothes off.

708
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:01,000
It's your bet.

709
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:03,400
- What?
- You got a deuce.

710
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,200
Not so bad now, huh?

711
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:09,400
What are you doing?
Go watch the window.

712
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:18,100
- This bet's 50.
- Nine. King.

713
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,400
Hey. Got a match?

714
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,300
And an ace to the dealer.
Fair bet.

715
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:35,700
- Hey, I don't see Lefty.
- Probably taking a leak.

716
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,500
- Two hundred.
- I'm out.

717
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:39,700
- Call.
- Raise 100.

718
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,600
You're raising?
You haven't got a pair showing.

719
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:47,100
Well, he ain't there.
I think somebody ought to go and check.

720
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:16,100
What are you talking about?
What's that?

721
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,300
All right.

722
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,100
- Your jacket?
- I can't give you my jacket.

723
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:30,800
- And why not?
- Because I've got a gun right here.

724
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:36,200
Hello, lieutenant. Since when
do you have the cathouse detail?

725
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,400
I want you, your girls and customers
on the street in five minutes.

726
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,900
I'm entertaining two congressmen
and a superior court judge.

727
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,800
- And a kidnap victim.
- Primo didn't give me any choice.

728
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,100
- Primo's dead.
- We can be out of here in two minutes.

729
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:52,700
- Where's the girl?
- End of the hall, facing the street, upstairs.

730
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:54,000
How many guns?

731
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:57,600
Four upstairs, one across the street,
one on the roof, one shooting pool.

732
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:15,900
- How about a fast game of sleeper?
- Never heard of it.

733
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:21,400
Well, it's simple. You go ahead
and make your shot, and I put you to sleep.

734
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,200
Okay.

735
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,400
I'm agile.

736
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:54,800
Who appointed him the boss anyway?

737
01:25:56,700 --> 01:26:00,500
My, Granny, what big eyes you have.

738
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:06,500
My, Granny, what big ears you have.

739
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:07,900
My, Granny--

740
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,600
- Murphy!
- Hi, Marie.

741
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:17,300
What the hell you doing?

742
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:21,500
I'm gonna do to a couple of mugs
what you're gonna do to the congressman.

743
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:24,100
Are you ready?

744
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:28,600
- Six nines.
- Five queens.

745
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:31,900
Hold it, Barney.
You can't have six cards.

746
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,700
- The hell I can't.
- Only five cards count.

747
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,300
- Not in this game.
- Ln any poker game.

748
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:40,100
This ain't any poker game.
This is her dumb game.

749
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:45,900
Dumb deuces, one-eyed jacks. I don't know
if I'm winning or losing this dumb game.

750
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:02,700
Oh, so big, so strong.

751
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:21,600
- No, no, I don't want the animal thing.
- Oh, sorry. Keep it up.

752
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:26,300
Pardon me. I'm sorry.

753
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,600
- That's everybody but the second floor.
- Good.

754
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:31,500
Not too much breakage, please.

755
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:35,900
Will that make it 40? I raise.
I raise you, Barney, all the time.

756
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,100
- What the--?
- What are you doing?

757
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:39,700
Take a walk. Wrong room.

758
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:42,300
- I raised over here.
- You bet. Let's go.

759
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,800
- Hey, baby.
- You hear? I said, take a walk!

760
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,800
I'll huff and I'll puff
and I'll blow your house down!

761
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,600
Hold it. Hold it!
Later, Speer, later!

762
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:26,900
Boys.

763
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:39,500
Well, it's about time!

764
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,500
Michael Twitchell Murphy,
I'm getting scared again.

765
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:52,100
- No, it's all over now.
- No, I don't mean gangsters.

766
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:55,300
I'm really getting scared, Mike.

767
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:01,900
- I'm a little terrified myself.
- So, what do we do about it?

768
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,700
Get that camera out of here.

769
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:10,800
All right. Let's go.

770
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:16,800
I want my goods.

771
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:36,800
Hold it.

772
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,600
You call it.

773
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,800
Let him have it.

774
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,300
Easy.

775
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:18,700
Sooner or later,
I'm gonna get those rats.

776
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:21,000
I got a feeling it's gonna be sooner.

777
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:35,200
- I thought you said you defused that.
- I lied.

778
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,800
Sit right here, lieutenant.

779
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:14,200
- Speer, you amaze me.
- Thank you, my dove.

780
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,800
Madam.

781
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:40,600
Hi, Addy. You know,
I been thinking it over, and...

782
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,200
...we make a pretty fair team.

783
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,400
Yeah, I suppose so, shorty.

784
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,900
All right, that tears it.

785
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:52,300
Step out here, brass ass,
and let's settle this right now.

786
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,800
Hey, pal! Pipe down
and then sit down.

787
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,300
- Down in front.
- Sit down!

788
01:31:56,500 --> 01:32:01,200
Hey, pal, when you talk to me, stand up.
Sorry, you are standing.

789
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:04,800
No reason to kneel.
We're not in church.

790
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:08,900
Oh, boy! We can play ball.
We got three bases.

791
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,100
Play ball.

792
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:31,900
This is either the Woolworth building,
in which case it's okay, or--

793
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,900
"The Leith police dismisseth us."

794
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:46,300
Aren't you gonna help him?

795
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:49,000
I abhor violence.

796
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:54,500
"The Leith police dismisseth us."

797
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:59,100
- I got a situation here.
- So?

798
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:00,700
That's it.

799
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:14,100
I'll take it from here.
Good luck in your radio career.

800
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:17,500
Where we going?
Out there, huh? Fine with me.

801
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:20,600
I need a lot of room
for you, pal. Yeah.

802
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:25,200
You know, I looked up "Neanderthal"
in the dictionary. There was a picture of you.

803
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:27,200
Whereabouts?

804
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:30,000
- Right here.
- That's good for me.

805
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:35,000
I don't know what Addy sees in you.
You know, she should go out with humans.

806
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:36,700
I was wrong.

807
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:40,800
- What?
- You can't take care of yourself.

808
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,700
They wrote a song about you.

809
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:49,000
"Brother, Can You Spare a Brain?"

810
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:52,100
- You want to know something?
- What?

811
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:56,000
You'll always be "shorty" to me.
