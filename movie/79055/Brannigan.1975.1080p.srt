1
00:02:10,423 --> 00:02:14,619
This is Captain Moretti to Unit 5.
Pick up Brannigan.

2
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,705
Use a forklift if you have to,
but get him.

3
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:21,793
APB on Lieutenant James Brannigan.

4
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,197
Knock knock.

5
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:53,742
Breaking and entering
is against the law, Brannigan.

6
00:02:53,842 --> 00:02:56,619
I rang. You didn't answer.

7
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,830
I was working.

8
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,166
Doing your own engraving now?

9
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:05,127
Hey, wouldn't know old Abe
without his mole.

10
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,214
Where's Larkin?

11
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,346
No serial number, no prints,
can't be traced.

12
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:18,683
Nobody'll know who dumped you.

13
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,519
I don't spook, Brannigan.

14
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:22,687
Oh, all right.

15
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:26,024
The government wants Larkin for taxes.

16
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:29,612
The Chicago Police
want him for extortion.

17
00:03:29,712 --> 00:03:31,780
Cut out the dedicated cop act.

18
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,157
Everybody in this town
knows you want Larkin.

19
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:36,201
And the grand jury finally indicts him

20
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:38,119
and he disappears like a short beer.

21
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:41,080
I'll give you five seconds
to tell me where.

22
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,623
You count.

23
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:50,924
Hey, wait a minute, wait, okay.
He left town.

24
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:53,051
- How?
- I don't know.

25
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:54,844
- Where?
- I don't know.

26
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:58,139
No, wait a minute, I don't know.
You got to believe me.

27
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:01,267
All right, cool it.

28
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,980
You must be getting old, Angell.

29
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,443
Trying to push second-rate
paper like this.

30
00:04:10,543 --> 00:04:13,613
Manny, this is Warehouse 17,
Polk Street,

31
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:15,073
I got a paperhanger.

32
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:16,950
Turn around, big man.

33
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,452
Angell, you're a real bush leaguer.

34
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:20,578
Yeah.

35
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:24,541
You know something,
I don't think it's loaded.

36
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:28,253
You dirty, lousy Mick, you got no rules.

37
00:04:28,353 --> 00:04:29,920
You got no...

38
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:33,591
Are you all right?

39
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:37,345
Are you all right, Jim?

40
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:40,056
Now listen, Jim, Moretti's steaming.

41
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:42,600
He's got the whole Chicago PD
looking for you.

42
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,102
Nice to be wanted.

43
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:47,272
You're wanted, all right.
There's an APB out on you.

44
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:51,901
Listen, Brannigan, you're dead.
There's a contract out on you.

45
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:56,322
Try explaining that
to your parole officer.

46
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:59,742
Larkin's put up 25 Gs
to get you knocked off.

47
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,661
You're gonna be walking down the street,

48
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:03,997
or sleeping, or sitting on the can,

49
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:06,082
and the next minute, Brannigan,

50
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:09,418
you are dead! You lousy Mick, you!

51
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:25,602
Brannigan.

52
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:28,605
He's on the inside, far end of 17.

53
00:05:28,705 --> 00:05:31,065
Not him.

54
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,650
Who?

55
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,568
You.

56
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:37,405
The Captain wants to see you. Now.

57
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:40,992
You got a warrant?

58
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:44,537
I don't need a warrant, Jim.
You're a public menace.

59
00:05:44,637 --> 00:05:47,165
- All right.
- Get in.

60
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:48,499
It's my car.

61
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:50,501
Joe will bring your car.

62
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:57,258
Careful with the paint job.

63
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:56,567
British Airways Flight 570,
nonstop 747 to London,

64
00:06:56,667 --> 00:07:00,070
will depart from the B Concourse.

65
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:03,324
Well, you made it.

66
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:07,078
All right, Captain, you going someplace?

67
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:10,832
No, Lieutenant. You are.

68
00:07:10,932 --> 00:07:12,416
I am?

69
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:19,090
What is this, Moretti?

70
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,760
Passport, airline ticket
and $500 expenses.

71
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:25,138
I packed a bag for you.

72
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:26,764
That is my bag.

73
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,057
I put everything in that was clean.

74
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:29,934
Here, don't catch a cold.

75
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:34,272
Moretti, you're gonna make somebody
a nice little wife.

76
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:35,440
I'm doing you a favor, Jim.

77
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,274
Yeah?

78
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:40,695
Ben Larkin got out of town
a couple of days ago.

79
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:41,779
I know that.

80
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,948
He's in London. Scotland Yard's got him.

81
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:46,742
- London?
- You got extradition papers.

82
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:48,202
Miss Allen.

83
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,954
I thought you might like
to bring him back

84
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:51,914
and personally kick him in a cell.

85
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,708
Miss Allen,
this is Lieutenant Brannigan.

86
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:55,543
- Hi.
- She'll find a seat for you.

87
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:56,836
All right.

88
00:07:56,936 --> 00:07:58,796
Just follow me, Lieutenant.

89
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:01,006
Anywhere.

90
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,872
Nice day.

91
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:18,042
Want to walk, Mel?

92
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:20,711
All right, you're on.

93
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:36,894
By the right.

94
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:42,316
Keep up, there.

95
00:09:47,046 --> 00:09:49,907
First order of business.
Call off the wolves.

96
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:53,077
Even the elevator man looks like
he's from Scotland Yard.

97
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:55,454
It may not be as simple as that.

98
00:09:55,972 --> 00:09:57,498
What broke loose?

99
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:01,169
The word was in the street, Ben.

100
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:03,796
Somebody talked, somebody listened.

101
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:07,091
Chicago is sending Jim Brannigan over

102
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,802
with extradition papers and handcuffs.

103
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:12,930
He'll be at Heathrow anytime now.

104
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,892
I told you I wanted
that big Irish bastard wasted.

105
00:10:15,992 --> 00:10:17,976
It's being taken care of, Ben.

106
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:21,439
That won't help
your extradition problem.

107
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:23,399
There'll only be a dozen Chicago cops

108
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:25,318
on the next flight with more papers.

109
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:28,196
Well, I'm not running. I like this town.

110
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:30,823
I like the women, the clubs, the action.
I always did.

111
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:34,660
Ben, please.
Listen to what I worked out.

112
00:10:36,304 --> 00:10:38,205
Now, in Devon,

113
00:10:38,306 --> 00:10:41,792
at an airport nobody's used for years,

114
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,836
I've got a pilot
who'll take you to Ireland,

115
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:47,173
where you'll skip immigration
and customs.

116
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:50,885
Then you head on south
to Ecuador, Venezuela.

117
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:52,970
Oh, that's just great.

118
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:56,682
I end up eating bananas,
listening to my arteries harden.

119
00:10:56,782 --> 00:11:00,144
Ben, I'm talking to you as your lawyer.

120
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:03,147
Your friend. Not a tour guide.

121
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:08,235
The Cook County grand jury
can't touch you down there.

122
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:17,036
Look, the boys will take care of you.
They have to.

123
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:19,705
They've got more skeletons
than most graveyards.

124
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:22,541
And you know what closets
they're hanging in.

125
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,336
Fields, we didn't build
this organization

126
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:29,047
by running from grand juries
just to save our hides.

127
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:31,967
- We stick together.
- That's what I'm saying.

128
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:35,263
To the boys, you're still number one.

129
00:11:35,363 --> 00:11:37,681
They'll see that you live like a king.

130
00:11:38,074 --> 00:11:40,559
They'll use me as a conduit.

131
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:43,479
I'll funnel the cash to Switzerland,

132
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,189
launder it in Panama,

133
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:48,526
and ship it to you
by bank drafts or letters of credit,

134
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:49,860
whichever you prefer.

135
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,113
That's good. That's good.

136
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:56,409
You know, Mel,

137
00:11:56,509 --> 00:11:59,036
those bananas will taste
a hell of a lot better

138
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:02,164
when I know Brannigan's
lying in some gutter.

139
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,333
It's done.

140
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,085
- Who you got?
- Gorman.

141
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:08,629
We used him before.

142
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:11,548
Good. He's a pro.

143
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:15,844
Enough of the walking. Let's ride.

144
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:46,917
British Airways Flight number BA 570

145
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:51,004
from Chicago now arriving
at gate number 2.

146
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,257
Is Flight 570 in yet?

147
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,676
Yes, it's just arrived.

148
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,762
Could you make the announcement, then?

149
00:12:57,862 --> 00:12:59,763
Yes.

150
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:03,267
Have a nice stay.

151
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:04,602
Thank you.

152
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:06,520
Would Mr. James Brannigan,

153
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,856
British Airways passenger from Chicago,

154
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:11,942
please report to the British Airways
information desk.

155
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,779
James Brannigan to British Airways
information desk, please.

156
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:20,075
How long are you expecting
to be with us, Mr. Gorman?

157
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,082
Mr. Gorman?

158
00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:28,041
Oh, sorry. A week.

159
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:30,878
Business or pleasure, sir?

160
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:32,963
Strictly pleasure.

161
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:38,135
Air India Flight number Al620

162
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:42,681
for Bombay and Tokyo
now boarding at gate number 8.

163
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:50,147
Lieutenant Brannigan?

164
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,733
Yes. How did you know?

165
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:57,071
Headquarters told me to look for someone
slightly smaller than the Statue of Liberty.

166
00:13:57,171 --> 00:14:00,533
Detective Sergeant Jennifer Thatcher, sir,
Scotland Yard.

167
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:03,702
They've made some real improvements
since I was last here.

168
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,830
Thank you. This way, sir.

169
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,831
Where's my man?

170
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:09,834
The prisoner, Ben Larkin.

171
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:12,795
Oh, Commander Swann
is handling the extradition.

172
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:15,673
And the return-ticket reservations?

173
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:17,341
Sir Charles has taken care of that.

174
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:19,510
He's expecting you
for lunch at his club, sir.

175
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,597
Sir Charles. Sir Charles.

176
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,150
I've been assigned
as your driver, Lieutenant.

177
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,569
And to generally take care of you
while you're here.

178
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:38,154
To keep an eye on me, you mean.

179
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:41,990
Well, not quite. It's more of a PR job.

180
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:45,661
Anyway, it'll make a nice change
from the Vice Squad.

181
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:33,166
- Okay, sir.
- Right.

182
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:41,591
Mel, I'm the one
that's going to take the heat.

183
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:44,303
Now, nothing can screw up.

184
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:46,305
Stay cool, Ben.

185
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:49,099
It's ticking like a Swiss watch.

186
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:58,108
- Morning, Mr. Larkin.
- Good to see you, Jules.

187
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,627
- Morning, Ben.
- Morning, boys.

188
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:28,096
Get me a box
at the dog races tonight, Gates.

189
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:32,684
Oh, yeah. Call Jimmy the Bet.

190
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:36,980
And tell him to put
£400 on Triple Cross.

191
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:40,067
Ready when you are, Mr. Larkin.

192
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,651
Good.

193
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,533
You've been to England before, sir?

194
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:52,329
That's right, Miss Thatcher,
during the war.

195
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,999
Well, I expect you'll find London's
changed quite a bit.

196
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:58,668
But it's basically the same,
still a very beautiful city.

197
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:02,006
If there are any places
you'd like to revisit, any pubs or any...

198
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:04,842
Right now, what I'd like is
about eight hours of sleep,

199
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:07,844
a shower and a change of clothes.

200
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:11,015
And to get my hands in Larkin's lapels.

201
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:12,516
Yes, sir.

202
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:18,022
I sound like a bear cub
with a toothache, it's just...

203
00:17:18,122 --> 00:17:21,817
I understand, sir.
My father flew with the RAF.

204
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:26,405
He said there were only three things
wrong with the Yanks.

205
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:27,531
Yeah?

206
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:31,326
Overpaid, oversexed and over here.

207
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,704
I really walked into that one.

208
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,374
And deserved it. I'm sorry.

209
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,835
Might we start again, sir.

210
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:42,879
Why? We're doing fine.

211
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:48,469
I was just thinking,
can I call you Jenny?

212
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,303
Of course.

213
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:54,308
Boy, I knew a great gal named Jenny.

214
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:00,313
She used to lend me money
when I was broke.

215
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:04,985
Did she contribute
any other philanthropies?

216
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:11,575
We were friends. Good friends.

217
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:17,581
Damn good friends.

218
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:13,803
- Right, Mr. Larkin.
- Hello, hello, hello.

219
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:20,060
Lie down facing this way.

220
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,437
- All right.
- And relax.

221
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:30,987
Excuse me, Jackson,
I've got a steam bath out there.

222
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:33,657
Well, the pool's down there,
but you'll have to go outside.

223
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:36,159
I'll show you the way.
It's right around the back.

224
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:02,352
Excuse me, Tom, there's a delivery.

225
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,980
What? I don't know anything
about a delivery.

226
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,732
- Neither do I.
- It's a rush order.

227
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,234
Where should we drop it?

228
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,861
Better put it out there.
Through the open door.

229
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,741
Grand Central Station.

230
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:23,749
Hey, muscles.

231
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:26,835
It's a bit tight here.
Can you give us a hand?

232
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:29,004
Excuse me a moment, Mr. Larkin.

233
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:35,969
Now, what's all this?

234
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:06,458
That's great.

235
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:09,753
You like that, do you?

236
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,151
How do you like that?

237
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,164
Morning, sir.

238
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,201
Here we are, sir. The Garrick Club.

239
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,384
See you later, sir.

240
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:22,344
Aren't you joining us?

241
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:25,055
If I walked in there,
I'd cause a dozen heart attacks.

242
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:28,684
It's a men's club.
Rules strictly enforced.

243
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:30,351
Too bad.

244
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:36,733
Sir?

245
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:40,529
Brannigan. Jim Brannigan
to see Commander Swann.

246
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:42,531
Yes, sir. That'd be Sir Charles.

247
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:44,991
He's in the lounge bar upstairs.

248
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:46,910
Thank you.

249
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,912
Begging your pardon, sir.

250
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:52,582
I'm sorry, Mr. Brannigan,
it's a club rule.

251
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,752
Fine.

252
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:58,796
Strictly enforced, I presume.

253
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:30,286
...and that was the last I saw of her.

254
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,460
Excuse me.

255
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:40,338
- Lieutenant Brannigan?
- Right.

256
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:43,091
Charles Swann. Pleasant flight?

257
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:44,551
Just long.

258
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:46,470
Would you like a glass of sherry, then?

259
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,764
Well, actually, I'd like a boilermaker.

260
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,602
That's a whiskey neat,
you'd say, and a beer chaser.

261
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:55,979
- Cold, if you can find it.
- Certainly, sir.

262
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,689
I think we can manage that.

263
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:59,983
A good old Polish drink.

264
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,318
Now, where do we pick up this Larkin?

265
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:04,946
Well, he's under surveillance.

266
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:06,573
Surveillance?

267
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:08,533
You come to the States for a prisoner,

268
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:11,661
and we'd have him standing by
handcuffed at the airport.

269
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:15,040
Yes, but you see,
under our judicial system,

270
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,751
Mr. Larkin has the right
to apply for bail.

271
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:20,837
Well, unfortunately,
we have the same law.

272
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,714
That's how we lost him.

273
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:24,883
Rather careless, wasn't it?

274
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:28,470
I think you can rest assured
that won't happen here.

275
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,263
Spot of lunch?

276
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:31,848
Why not?

277
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:36,019
Then we'll pick up your friend Larkin.

278
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:43,360
Should I call you Sir Charles?

279
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,529
Oh, I think Swann
will do nicely, thank you.

280
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:48,657
I only use the Sir for theater tickets
and table reservations.

281
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:50,658
May I lead the way?

282
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:52,410
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

283
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,830
Actually, the title
is a military courtesy

284
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,374
granted to one of my ancient ancestors.

285
00:25:57,474 --> 00:26:00,335
Probably for holding somebody's
horse at a coronation.

286
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:02,587
- How's this?
- Thank you.

287
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:04,131
No castles or booty?

288
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:06,049
No, I'm afraid not.

289
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:09,010
But every Maundy Thursday,
for some totally unaccountable reason,

290
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,637
I'm granted the inestimable privilege...

291
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,264
- Morning, Barker.
- Morning, Sir Charles.

292
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:15,058
...of dropping a sprig of myrtle
in the River Thames at Westminster.

293
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,270
The Dover sole is excellent.

294
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,313
Thank you very much. Dover sole?

295
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:22,357
Commander, it's my breakfast time.

296
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:24,818
I'd sure like two over easy,

297
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:27,612
some bacon crisp and a short stack.

298
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:30,282
Right. I think what my guest
would like is

299
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:32,701
two eggs lightly fried on either side,

300
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:36,705
a couple of rashers of bacon
and a modest portion of pancakes.

301
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:38,456
Not too modest on the pancakes.

302
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:40,458
- Right, sir.
- And Dover sole for me, please.

303
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:41,959
Thank you, sir.

304
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:46,422
Lieutenant, you shouldn't be wearing
that particular item.

305
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:50,927
Well, a fellow at the front desk said
I had to put it on.

306
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:55,431
Not the tie,
the .38 caliber Colt Diamondback.

307
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:02,647
Commander, I always wear this.

308
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,734
Well, I'm afraid it's placing you
in violation of

309
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:08,444
British law
and Scotland Yard regulations.

310
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:12,741
Well, it isn't in violation
of United States law,

311
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:15,952
and I work under the Chicago
Police Department regulations,

312
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:18,287
which makes it obligatory.

313
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:22,834
Then I strongly urge you to resist
any temptation to use it.

314
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:28,881
Well, I don't think
I'll be needing it in here.

315
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,426
Excuse me, Sir Charles.

316
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:33,553
Gentleman to see you at the door.

317
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:36,889
Excuse me.

318
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:00,330
Barker.

319
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:04,000
Bring the Lieutenant a whiskey
and a beer chaser, will you.

320
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,085
You mean a boilermaker, sir.

321
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:09,130
Make it two.

322
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:12,717
What for?

323
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:16,179
Mr. Larkin has been kidnapped.

324
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:24,604
It can't happen here, huh?

325
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:33,738
Well, cheer up.

326
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:36,991
All we can lose is our jobs.

327
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:07,707
- Oh! Gorman?
- Yeah.

328
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:17,258
A friend of mine said
you had a package for me.

329
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:21,470
Two questions. From where and for what?

330
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,750
From Chicago, to hit something.

331
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,016
Right on, bucko.

332
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:36,152
Half now, and half at ice time.

333
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:38,780
When he's on ice, you mean.

334
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:03,763
It's a bit light.

335
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:05,932
It's just my usual commission.

336
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:11,287
Off their end. Not mine.
Don't be difficult, friend.

337
00:31:11,387 --> 00:31:15,474
Why don't you stay awhile
and talk to Luana?

338
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:02,321
Nice and gentle, love, I'm not kinky.

339
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:05,157
You are what you're paid to be.

340
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:21,132
This is all that Larkin left behind
at the athletic club.

341
00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:23,593
We don't know that Larkin
was really snatched.

342
00:32:23,693 --> 00:32:25,428
Of course not.

343
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:28,556
But we do still have
that masseur unconscious in hospital.

344
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:30,767
That's might be just an act.

345
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:32,685
At this particular point
I don't think that's

346
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:35,188
an assumption the Yard
can afford to make.

347
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:37,607
Well, if it was up to me,
I'd get some men out

348
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:41,236
thumping on the streets,
passing out some e pluribus unum.

349
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:44,488
That's what 90% of police work is today.

350
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:47,158
The murder rate
in your country, I'm sure,

351
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:50,870
gives ample testimony
to your superior police methods.

352
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:54,582
Well, Commander, I didn't come over here
to argue police methods.

353
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:57,585
But a certain Ben Larkin is missing.

354
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:01,005
And I intend to use
my best efforts to find him.

355
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:03,883
Without interfering
with the Yard, of course.

356
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,343
Oh, Lieutenant.

357
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:08,763
I am still a little concerned

358
00:33:08,863 --> 00:33:11,766
about a certain item you're wearing.

359
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:15,186
Oh, well if that bothers you,

360
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,688
wear it in good health.

361
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:20,524
The old school tie.

362
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:31,077
Well, guv, what do you think
of our friend Brannigan?

363
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:37,291
Well, he's an American.

364
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,056
Sir Charles.

365
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:56,412
Why would a bona fide lord
want to be a cop?

366
00:33:56,512 --> 00:33:58,979
Because he's good at it.
Why are you a cop?

367
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,566
I don't know. Runs in the family.

368
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:03,693
But it stops right here.

369
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:05,361
My son is a lawyer.

370
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:11,283
Hello, Central? Central 77 here.

371
00:34:12,677 --> 00:34:14,871
Mollie? Do me a favor, will you?

372
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:17,456
Call Richard and tell him I'll be late.

373
00:34:17,932 --> 00:34:20,876
I don't know. About 7:00. Thanks.

374
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,379
Monkey wrench?

375
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,173
You mean a spanner?

376
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,218
Did I throw one in your social life?

377
00:34:29,718 --> 00:34:31,721
Well, not quite.

378
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:35,057
Not that Richard is exactly
a paragon of patience.

379
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:39,354
Well, just blame it
on your Yankee slave driver,

380
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:41,481
who still hasn't eaten.

381
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:44,525
Would you mind grabbing a bite
before we go house hunting?

382
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,527
I wouldn't mind at all.

383
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:31,739
Thank you very much.

384
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,117
Lieutenant, I'll see you in the morning.

385
00:35:34,217 --> 00:35:37,620
- Maybe around nine?
- About that, goodnight.

386
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:12,548
Mr. Lawyer, the next voice your hear

387
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:16,510
belongs to Ben Larkin.
You'd better listen.

388
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,848
Fields, I've been grabbed
by a couple of hoods.

389
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:22,433
They're tough.

390
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:25,519
So you do exactly what I tell you,
or I'm a dead man.

391
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:28,064
Now, you've got five envelopes
with this tape.

392
00:37:28,164 --> 00:37:32,276
First, put £50,000 in each envelope.
Get old, used bills.

393
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,403
Then you make the drop in person.

394
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:37,240
Come alone to the mailbox
in the middle of Piccadilly Circus

395
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,284
at exactly 11:35 a.m. tomorrow morning.

396
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:42,203
You got that?

397
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:45,581
Next, stay away
from those damn limey cops.

398
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:48,084
They could screw things up.

399
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:49,961
There's a gun at my head, Fields,

400
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:51,920
so don't blow this one.

401
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:55,299
Or my guys will tear your heart out.

402
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:02,639
Why did you double-cross him, Fields?

403
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:04,475
What does that mean?

404
00:38:04,575 --> 00:38:07,228
Larkin told you to stay away
from the cops.

405
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:09,730
In Chicago, I would have.

406
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:12,358
But considering the reputation
of Scotland Yard,

407
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:15,444
I decided it was
in the best interests of my client

408
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:17,863
to put the matter in their hands.

409
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:22,243
You're a real Eagle Scout, Fields.

410
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:25,538
We don't even know
that that's Larkin's voice.

411
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:30,001
Inspector, Mr. Larkin called in
to complain about our surveillance, sir.

412
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:32,458
The call was routed
routinely through Central

413
00:38:32,558 --> 00:38:35,881
where it was in turn re-directed
to the switchboard of our department.

414
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:38,467
In rather sulfurous language,
I must say,

415
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:39,886
Mr. Larkin demanded...

416
00:38:39,986 --> 00:38:41,887
Yes, thank you, Mike, thank you.

417
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:46,309
The point is, we taped Larkin's call,
voiceprinted it.

418
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:48,143
They matched.

419
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:54,775
Do you think you can raise
that money by tomorrow morning?

420
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,652
That's no problem.

421
00:38:56,752 --> 00:39:01,365
Fortunately, Mr. Larkin has generous
and influential associates in the States.

422
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:04,326
Translation, Commander, hoods.

423
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:06,829
A bank draft is on its way.

424
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:11,667
Mob money, squeezed out of hookers
and skimmed off of casinos.

425
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:15,838
Yes, well, I think we perhaps
better get on with it, Mr. Fields.

426
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:19,299
Commander, what will you be doing?

427
00:39:19,692 --> 00:39:23,220
Well, our interests are mutual.
The safe return of Mr. Larkin.

428
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:25,597
We'll keep you informed.

429
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:38,629
It's a bit dicey.

430
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:41,256
Not a copper in sight.

431
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:47,596
They're down there, all right.
I can smell them.

432
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:09,993
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

433
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:39,750
Attention, all units.
Attention, all units.

434
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:42,210
Rolls-Royce approaching the circus.

435
00:43:54,216 --> 00:43:55,868
Drop completed.

436
00:43:55,968 --> 00:43:57,869
Prepare for pickup phase.

437
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:13,051
Well, now we'll see.

438
00:44:57,696 --> 00:45:01,266
Mailman's just passed me.
Approaching the island now.

439
00:46:10,227 --> 00:46:12,087
It's too damn simple.

440
00:46:14,648 --> 00:46:16,091
Pickup completed.

441
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:18,134
Right, job completed. Let's go.

442
00:46:32,374 --> 00:46:34,025
We'll take it.

443
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:34,141
It's a messenger on a motor scooter.
We're on him.

444
00:50:34,241 --> 00:50:35,975
Right. Get going!

445
00:50:48,714 --> 00:50:52,158
- Like I said.
- Too damn simple.

446
00:50:52,801 --> 00:50:56,037
That's right. Too damn simple.

447
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,716
Don't get too far behind.

448
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:15,909
Give Harry a hand, there.

449
00:52:36,613 --> 00:52:38,514
Hold it!

450
00:52:41,076 --> 00:52:42,894
Can you swim?

451
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:44,938
- Yeah.
- Go get it!

452
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:57,659
I'll sink with these boots on!

453
00:52:59,344 --> 00:53:01,162
Oy, give us a hand.

454
00:53:02,764 --> 00:53:04,958
After a few questions.

455
00:53:09,646 --> 00:53:12,173
What's the idea of throwing
this money in the river?

456
00:53:12,607 --> 00:53:13,717
Money?

457
00:53:13,817 --> 00:53:15,969
I don't know nothing about no money.

458
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:20,348
Some bloke mailed the instructions,
with a five-pound note.

459
00:53:32,878 --> 00:53:34,529
Newspaper.

460
00:53:34,629 --> 00:53:36,030
What?

461
00:53:36,131 --> 00:53:38,366
They pulled a Murphy.

462
00:53:38,675 --> 00:53:41,036
Hey, what about me?

463
00:53:41,136 --> 00:53:43,037
A Murphy?

464
00:53:57,611 --> 00:53:59,012
Okay.

465
00:54:11,374 --> 00:54:14,068
Yeah, they tunneled from underneath.

466
00:54:14,794 --> 00:54:19,241
Yes, of course. And then they switched
envelopes by means of...

467
00:54:19,341 --> 00:54:21,367
A false bottom.

468
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,500
As simple as that.

469
00:54:30,018 --> 00:54:31,794
A magnet.

470
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:39,927
Ruddy sewers.
They'll be miles away by now.

471
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:11,918
I'll be right back.

472
00:55:31,204 --> 00:55:33,398
Hello, Mrs. Cooper.

473
00:55:33,498 --> 00:55:36,025
Good afternoon, Mr. Brannigan.

474
00:55:37,085 --> 00:55:38,445
Would you like a coffee?

475
00:55:38,545 --> 00:55:42,115
Oh, thank you, no.
Some people are waiting for me.

476
00:55:42,215 --> 00:55:44,158
Oh, pity.

477
00:56:59,167 --> 00:57:01,235
Oh, Mrs. Cooper.

478
00:57:01,711 --> 00:57:03,738
Yes, Mr. Brannigan?

479
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,241
Did I have any visitors today?

480
00:57:06,341 --> 00:57:08,410
No, I don't think so.

481
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:10,119
Thank you.

482
00:57:10,762 --> 00:57:16,209
Oh, there was a man here.
Something about the central heating.

483
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:06,217
What happened?

484
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:08,845
Your central heating friend
left me a present.

485
00:58:08,945 --> 00:58:11,305
- We must call the police.
- He is the police.

486
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,934
I have never seen anything
like it in my life.

487
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:43,170
- You're insured?
- Oh, yes, I am.

488
00:58:46,816 --> 00:58:49,218
- Jim?
- In here.

489
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:03,608
What are you doing?

490
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:06,444
Well, I'm afraid that the...
I'll show you.

491
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,492
You mean he's put another one in there?

492
00:59:12,592 --> 00:59:14,243
I mean...

493
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:19,457
- That's what I mean.
- Yes.

494
00:59:28,608 --> 00:59:30,009
Yeah.

495
00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:35,389
Larkin paid 25 grand
to get me that view.

496
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:48,069
- All the usual checks being made?
- Yes, sir.

497
00:59:49,955 --> 00:59:51,573
All been fingerprinted, guv.

498
00:59:51,673 --> 00:59:53,950
I want a complete report
on all sales of gelignite

499
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:55,743
- during the past two months.
- Right, guv.

500
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:58,746
And try and trace that damn thing.

501
00:59:58,972 --> 01:00:02,166
- Where is he?
- He's downstairs at Mrs. Cooper's, sir.

502
01:00:04,102 --> 01:00:06,254
Oh, don't you look nice.

503
01:00:06,354 --> 01:00:07,380
Well, thank you.

504
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,257
I'm sorry I haven't a room available,

505
01:00:09,357 --> 01:00:11,301
but I'm sure I could make room
for you in my place.

506
01:00:11,401 --> 01:00:12,927
Oh, that's very kind of you, but...

507
01:00:13,027 --> 01:00:14,637
- No, really, it'd be a pleasure.
- Lieutenant.

508
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:18,349
Jennifer, don't you think we ought to show
our visitor a bit of British hospitality?

509
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:20,351
Why don't you take him out
for a spot of dinner?

510
01:00:20,451 --> 01:00:21,436
Yes, sir.

511
01:00:21,536 --> 01:00:24,814
Oh, that's very kind of you.
And leave the police work to the Yard.

512
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,442
Thank you very much, Mrs. Cooper.

513
01:00:27,542 --> 01:00:29,777
Oh, yes, Mrs. Cooper, thank you.

514
01:00:32,714 --> 01:00:34,573
Enjoy yourself, Lieutenant.

515
01:00:34,841 --> 01:00:36,409
I will.

516
01:00:40,221 --> 01:00:44,166
Perhaps you'd care
for a cup of coffee. Come along.

517
01:00:45,226 --> 01:00:46,794
Well.

518
01:01:02,535 --> 01:01:04,729
It says For Sale.

519
01:01:04,829 --> 01:01:07,273
Well, I'm sure I can persuade them
to rent it to you for a week.

520
01:01:07,373 --> 01:01:08,608
If you don't mind me as a neighbor.

521
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:11,902
Why should I?
It puts me closer to my driver.

522
01:01:25,767 --> 01:01:27,168
It's been a lovely evening, Jim.

523
01:01:27,268 --> 01:01:29,504
Yeah, pleasant.

524
01:01:29,604 --> 01:01:32,173
And I hate to change the mood.

525
01:01:32,273 --> 01:01:34,884
But, Jenny, I want you to do me a favor.

526
01:01:34,984 --> 01:01:37,178
You shouldn't have that, Jim.
That's a felony.

527
01:01:37,278 --> 01:01:39,514
- Is that so?
- Yes, that is so.

528
01:01:39,614 --> 01:01:41,516
Commander Swann was not amused.

529
01:01:41,616 --> 01:01:44,269
I had all these names run down
by the Department.

530
01:01:44,369 --> 01:01:46,812
They all check out except that one.

531
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:50,275
- Jimmy the Bet.
- That's right, do you know him?

532
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:53,778
Yeah, he's a bookie. He's also a grass.

533
01:01:53,878 --> 01:01:57,573
What you would call a stoolie.
He's got his eye on every keyhole in London.

534
01:01:57,673 --> 01:01:59,450
Is it important?

535
01:01:59,634 --> 01:02:03,162
Anything that has to do
with Larkin is important.

536
01:02:03,346 --> 01:02:07,625
He's in blackmail, extortion, hard drugs.
You name it, he's in it.

537
01:02:10,812 --> 01:02:14,673
Jenny, I just happen to be working
the other side of the street.

538
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,926
Is that all?

539
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:23,724
Well, a couple of years ago,
I was making it tough for him.

540
01:02:24,617 --> 01:02:29,396
And one night he hit back.
Pair of shotguns.

541
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:32,859
But he obviously missed.

542
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:37,571
But the rookie riding with me
took a blast in his face.

543
01:02:38,548 --> 01:02:43,035
He left a widow
and a couple of nice kids.

544
01:02:44,303 --> 01:02:46,247
I'm sorry, Jim.

545
01:02:46,347 --> 01:02:48,249
You must have been close to him.

546
01:02:48,349 --> 01:02:52,503
Oh, it'd make a good story,
but that's not the reason.

547
01:02:53,521 --> 01:02:57,132
The truth is, I hated his guts.
He didn't like me.

548
01:02:57,525 --> 01:03:01,262
He had a degree in criminology and...
Well, to hell with that.

549
01:03:01,821 --> 01:03:05,308
My job was to keep him alive
until he could

550
01:03:05,408 --> 01:03:08,978
get smart enough or tough enough
to take care of himself.

551
01:03:11,372 --> 01:03:12,398
I blew it.

552
01:03:18,129 --> 01:03:19,989
What's that for?

553
01:03:20,465 --> 01:03:22,324
I don't know.

554
01:03:22,717 --> 01:03:25,911
You're just so damn solid.

555
01:03:26,721 --> 01:03:28,414
Fat, you mean.

556
01:03:30,349 --> 01:03:32,960
- Telephone for you, sir.
- Thank you.

557
01:03:33,394 --> 01:03:34,795
Hello?

558
01:03:36,105 --> 01:03:40,676
Yes, Inspector. Yes, right away.

559
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:45,306
He wants us back at the office.

560
01:03:54,415 --> 01:03:57,192
Yes, well, there's no doubt
this fingerprint is Larkin's.

561
01:03:59,128 --> 01:04:03,232
Oh, forgive me for interrupting
your evening, Lieutenant.

562
01:04:03,632 --> 01:04:06,828
Jenny, the artist has a sketch
of our mad bomber up in 194.

563
01:04:06,928 --> 01:04:09,163
- Pick it up for me, will you?
- Yes, sir.

564
01:04:11,766 --> 01:04:15,378
Your theory that Mr. Larkin
may have staged his own kidnapping

565
01:04:15,478 --> 01:04:16,504
doesn't quite work.

566
01:04:16,604 --> 01:04:17,630
Is that so?

567
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:21,300
Someone sent us
a personal contribution from Mr. Larkin.

568
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:24,678
Did you print it?

569
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:27,348
Of course.

570
01:04:27,782 --> 01:04:30,267
Third finger of the left hand.

571
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:37,399
And it was accompanied by a demand
for an additional 350,000 quid.

572
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:40,945
That brings the ante up to
a million and a half dollars.

573
01:04:41,045 --> 01:04:44,031
The additional payment
was in the nature of a penalty

574
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:47,452
because Mr. Fields consulted
the Yard for assistance.

575
01:04:47,552 --> 01:04:50,037
- These gentlemen play rough.
- And smart.

576
01:04:50,137 --> 01:04:53,165
They certainly made bloody fools of us
in that Piccadilly caper.

577
01:04:53,641 --> 01:04:57,670
All my years in the Yard, I've never
received a finger in the morning post.

578
01:04:58,062 --> 01:05:00,381
God knows what they'll be
sending us next. On, thanks.

579
01:05:00,481 --> 01:05:01,716
Well, that's it.

580
01:05:01,816 --> 01:05:04,385
It's only based on your landlady's
description, of course.

581
01:05:04,485 --> 01:05:08,222
But we've wired copies to Interpol,
the Sûreté and the FBI.

582
01:05:08,322 --> 01:05:09,724
Does it ring a bell for you?

583
01:05:09,824 --> 01:05:13,686
No, but if Larkin has a contract on me,
he'd hire top talent.

584
01:05:13,786 --> 01:05:16,314
Then I want you
on the next flight to Chicago.

585
01:05:16,414 --> 01:05:19,692
You care, Commander, you really care.

586
01:05:20,668 --> 01:05:24,363
I want you in Chicago alive,
you big sod.

587
01:05:24,505 --> 01:05:27,700
I don't want you in London
as an unsolved homicide.

588
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,035
We're short-staffed as it is.

589
01:05:29,135 --> 01:05:31,954
We have the same problem
in Chicago, Commander.

590
01:05:32,179 --> 01:05:33,914
Goodnight.

591
01:05:34,015 --> 01:05:35,416
Goodnight.

592
01:05:36,017 --> 01:05:38,210
Oh, Lieutenant.

593
01:05:40,605 --> 01:05:42,590
I'll take that particular item.

594
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:44,466
You mean the...

595
01:05:46,986 --> 01:05:48,387
The notepad.

596
01:05:50,906 --> 01:05:55,602
I guess I picked this up by mistake.

597
01:05:55,828 --> 01:05:58,522
Of course. That's what I assumed.

598
01:06:03,252 --> 01:06:05,446
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, sir.

599
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:16,791
Listen, darling, I've got a problem.
I've got to stay on duty till 2:00.

600
01:06:16,891 --> 01:06:19,418
Well, here comes my problem.

601
01:06:19,894 --> 01:06:22,547
Oh, Jim, this is my fiancé,
Richard Nelson.

602
01:06:22,647 --> 01:06:23,965
- Jim Brannigan.
- Oh, how are you?

603
01:06:24,065 --> 01:06:25,841
So, you're the guy
who's been ruining our love life.

604
01:06:27,193 --> 01:06:28,928
I'm glad you're not 20 years younger.

605
01:06:29,028 --> 01:06:31,597
If I were, you'd have to worry.

606
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:36,143
Well, we're not finished yet.
One more call. Sorry.

607
01:06:36,994 --> 01:06:39,146
- Goodnight, love.
- Goodnight.

608
01:06:44,627 --> 01:06:47,529
Okay, where to?

609
01:06:47,755 --> 01:06:48,823
Jimmy the Bet.

610
01:06:48,923 --> 01:06:52,117
Oh, you watch him.
He's a tough customer.

611
01:07:09,527 --> 01:07:11,470
- Evening, Jimmy.
- I've got no time for bird cops.

612
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:13,180
I got £1,000 on this fight.

613
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,183
Jimmy, it isn't social, it's official.
Open up.

614
01:07:19,412 --> 01:07:23,107
It still isn't social. I'm a cop.

615
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:24,567
It shows, flatfoot.

616
01:07:24,667 --> 01:07:28,529
And I found your name on a notepad
of Benny Larkin's.

617
01:07:28,629 --> 01:07:29,947
Is he one of your customers?

618
01:07:30,047 --> 01:07:33,575
I got nothing to say to you. Out!

619
01:07:34,009 --> 01:07:36,621
Benny Larkin's been kidnapped.

620
01:07:36,721 --> 01:07:38,748
You're gonna give me some information.

621
01:07:38,848 --> 01:07:42,209
I can ask questions easy,
or I can ask them hard.

622
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:44,211
Which will it be?

623
01:07:44,311 --> 01:07:47,089
This is what I answer questions with.

624
01:07:47,189 --> 01:07:48,758
It's mighty persuasive.

625
01:07:48,858 --> 01:07:52,427
I guess the questions can wait.
But not for long.

626
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:03,397
Now, would you like to try
for England's free dental care,

627
01:08:03,497 --> 01:08:05,733
or are you gonna answer my questions?

628
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:08,026
I'll ask you just once.

629
01:08:09,545 --> 01:08:11,947
- Name a name.
- Al Drexel.

630
01:08:12,548 --> 01:08:15,284
- Did you hear another?
- No, I swear it.

631
01:08:16,343 --> 01:08:18,079
Where can I find this Drexel?

632
01:08:18,179 --> 01:08:21,332
A pub, he goes there, the Lamb Tavern.

633
01:08:21,432 --> 01:08:23,125
He goes there midday.

634
01:08:24,518 --> 01:08:26,253
Well, thanks, Jimmy.

635
01:08:26,854 --> 01:08:30,507
You know something,
that Jackson's a bum.

636
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:33,760
He won't make it through the eighth.

637
01:08:45,206 --> 01:08:46,940
Any trouble?

638
01:08:47,082 --> 01:08:51,987
No trouble. Little hard
to understand his accent.

639
01:09:12,024 --> 01:09:13,300
That's Scotch rump steak, sir.

640
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,219
Right, well, I'll have that one, please.

641
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:18,973
I don't mind this turning
into a shopping tour

642
01:09:19,073 --> 01:09:21,183
as long as it ends up with Drexel.

643
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,981
I say. Talk of the devil.

644
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:32,111
That's him in the gray suit,
walking towards the pub now.

645
01:09:32,211 --> 01:09:36,365
Fine, would you just give me time
to get a little friendly.

646
01:09:59,446 --> 01:10:01,515
Mind if I butt in, partner?

647
01:10:01,615 --> 01:10:02,641
It's a free country.

648
01:10:02,741 --> 01:10:04,142
- All right, Navy?
- Yes, sure.

649
01:10:04,577 --> 01:10:06,228
Yeah, it's a pleasant country.

650
01:10:06,328 --> 01:10:07,521
I wouldn't argue with that.

651
01:10:07,621 --> 01:10:11,192
Last time I was here, people were
getting bombed a different way.

652
01:10:19,633 --> 01:10:21,786
Doris, let's have some service here.
The man's dying of thirst.

653
01:10:21,886 --> 01:10:23,662
All right, darling, what do you want?

654
01:10:23,762 --> 01:10:25,039
Well, I want some Guinness.
How about you?

655
01:10:25,139 --> 01:10:26,874
- Same again, please.
- Good.

656
01:10:26,974 --> 01:10:28,876
- Navy?
- No, I've got enough, thanks.

657
01:10:28,976 --> 01:10:30,711
How is the second-best Navy?

658
01:10:30,811 --> 01:10:32,463
- You should know.
- Nice one, Ted.

659
01:10:34,023 --> 01:10:37,467
Well, partner. Cheers.

660
01:10:39,987 --> 01:10:42,681
Wait a minute, friend,
we're having a drink.

661
01:10:42,781 --> 01:10:45,935
Drexel, I'd like a few words with you.
Let's step outside, shall we?

662
01:10:46,035 --> 01:10:47,895
Scotland Yard. Can't you smell it?

663
01:10:47,995 --> 01:10:49,605
Is it illegal to have a drink?

664
01:10:49,705 --> 01:10:51,774
May I suggest, sir,
that you keep out of this.

665
01:10:51,874 --> 01:10:53,526
This is strictly police business.

666
01:10:53,626 --> 01:10:56,237
Oh, tell him to show you his badge.

667
01:10:56,337 --> 01:10:58,906
Drexel, I said outside. Now come on.

668
01:10:59,006 --> 01:11:00,699
That cuts it!

669
01:11:05,888 --> 01:11:07,248
Sorry.

670
01:11:09,642 --> 01:11:11,418
Hey, what are you doing?

671
01:11:18,484 --> 01:11:19,844
What's the idea?

672
01:11:19,944 --> 01:11:21,678
Well, who the hell started it?

673
01:11:24,865 --> 01:11:26,600
Awfully sorry.

674
01:11:36,126 --> 01:11:38,945
And I love you so

675
01:11:39,964 --> 01:11:43,450
Let the sun shine

676
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:47,287
Let the sunshine in

677
01:11:51,225 --> 01:11:54,461
Let the sun shine

678
01:11:54,561 --> 01:11:58,465
Let the sunshine in

679
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:16,583
Guv.

680
01:12:27,803 --> 01:12:29,204
Guv!

681
01:12:29,471 --> 01:12:30,997
Mike, have you got it?

682
01:12:31,181 --> 01:12:32,374
Seems likely, guv.

683
01:12:32,474 --> 01:12:35,794
Gwendolyn Rooke.
Female, Caucasian, aged 26.

684
01:12:37,563 --> 01:12:39,048
Well, get on with it then.

685
01:12:39,148 --> 01:12:41,299
The subject resides in Balham.

686
01:12:42,151 --> 01:12:43,886
I'm sorry, lady. If I were you, I'd...

687
01:12:43,986 --> 01:12:45,679
Look out!

688
01:12:51,618 --> 01:12:53,604
And has access to blueprints and charts

689
01:12:53,704 --> 01:12:56,148
for telephone and sewage conduits...

690
01:12:58,751 --> 01:13:00,527
...under Piccadilly Circus.

691
01:13:04,173 --> 01:13:06,533
This place is getting kinda unfriendly.

692
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:09,536
- You're right.
- Where are we going?

693
01:13:09,636 --> 01:13:12,080
Let's go to my place and have a drink.

694
01:13:19,772 --> 01:13:21,214
You all right?

695
01:13:22,149 --> 01:13:24,176
Come on, partner.

696
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:26,428
We'd better get out of here.

697
01:13:38,499 --> 01:13:39,900
The Yank's got our pigeon.

698
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,443
As far as I can see.

699
01:13:59,019 --> 01:14:01,922
Yes, well, perhaps
we'd better look her over.

700
01:14:02,731 --> 01:14:04,425
See what Miss Rooke
has to say for herself.

701
01:14:04,525 --> 01:14:07,928
Oh, and, Mike, while you're at it,

702
01:14:08,028 --> 01:14:09,930
run this lot of rowdies in, will you.

703
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:11,515
Right, guv.

704
01:14:13,075 --> 01:14:15,227
Excuse me. How's your wrist?

705
01:14:36,314 --> 01:14:38,125
Constable. Arrest that lot, will you.

706
01:14:38,225 --> 01:14:40,210
Come on, sir. Come on.

707
01:14:42,146 --> 01:14:43,630
It had nothing to do with me.

708
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:45,924
I'm only here for the beer.

709
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:50,971
I think you'll find the evidence
is conclusive, sir,

710
01:14:51,071 --> 01:14:52,014
if you would just examine the map.

711
01:14:52,114 --> 01:14:54,224
Yes, of course. Thank you.

712
01:14:55,909 --> 01:14:57,769
Thanks, Mike.

713
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:03,817
Last month,

714
01:15:06,753 --> 01:15:08,363
the 16th, to be exact,

715
01:15:09,047 --> 01:15:10,282
you made copies of maps

716
01:15:10,382 --> 01:15:14,953
detailing the electrical and sewage conduits
beneath Piccadilly Circus.

717
01:15:15,554 --> 01:15:17,039
That's what I'm paid to do, sir.

718
01:15:17,139 --> 01:15:18,832
Of course.

719
01:15:18,932 --> 01:15:21,043
But to whom did you give those copies?

720
01:15:21,143 --> 01:15:23,336
To one of my supervisors, I expect.

721
01:15:24,688 --> 01:15:29,342
Miss Rooke, both you and I know
that that is not true.

722
01:15:33,989 --> 01:15:37,810
Protecting a criminal, Miss Rooke,
is a crime in itself.

723
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:43,398
And I suggest that in your own
best interests you stop lying to me.

724
01:15:51,048 --> 01:15:53,200
It's okay. It's okay.
Don't upset yourself.

725
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:54,660
Miss Rooke.

726
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,453
I've always been a good girl, sir.

727
01:15:56,553 --> 01:16:00,248
I'm sure you have, my dear.
But to whom did you give them?

728
01:16:02,643 --> 01:16:05,462
To my boyfriend, Freddy.

729
01:16:08,482 --> 01:16:09,883
Freddy.

730
01:16:11,276 --> 01:16:12,786
Now, now, come on.

731
01:16:13,463 --> 01:16:14,596
Watch it, partner.

732
01:16:14,696 --> 01:16:17,182
- I'm only just...
- You're a handful.

733
01:16:20,494 --> 01:16:23,438
I like Americans. They think big.

734
01:16:24,498 --> 01:16:27,109
Wait till you see what I've got here.
Take a look at this.

735
01:16:27,209 --> 01:16:28,360
Look at what?

736
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:32,238
I've got a deal going here
that'll make your hair stand on end.

737
01:16:34,967 --> 01:16:39,079
Oh, no, you're getting too familiar.
I've only just met you.

738
01:16:39,179 --> 01:16:41,373
We're only acquaintances yet.

739
01:16:41,473 --> 01:16:44,501
Well, you know what I think
you need, fella, is a cup of coffee.

740
01:16:44,601 --> 01:16:46,044
- I need another drink.
- Come on.

741
01:16:46,144 --> 01:16:47,921
- I can't stand coffee.
- Get in the kitchen.

742
01:16:48,021 --> 01:16:51,216
Come on, let's have a fight, Marquis
of Queensberry rules. Let's have a drink.

743
01:16:58,198 --> 01:17:00,392
Give me a minute
and I'll fix you right up,

744
01:17:00,492 --> 01:17:02,728
- if I can find the coffee.
- I don't want any coffee.

745
01:17:02,828 --> 01:17:05,814
Maybe you'll have to settle for tea.

746
01:17:56,548 --> 01:18:00,994
All right, Buster,
the friendly hour's over. Wake up.

747
01:18:05,515 --> 01:18:07,333
Come on, get up.

748
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:16,634
Hold it up, down there!

749
01:18:34,294 --> 01:18:36,696
Get off, you stupid-looking mutt.

750
01:18:37,839 --> 01:18:39,240
Sorry!

751
01:18:41,968 --> 01:18:44,204
Police, son. Follow that car.

752
01:18:44,554 --> 01:18:47,373
What? Police? What car?

753
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:50,711
- Right-hand drive.
- Of course.

754
01:18:50,811 --> 01:18:52,378
Well...

755
01:19:16,837 --> 01:19:18,113
I say...

756
01:19:18,213 --> 01:19:21,783
This is actually a new car, you know.

757
01:19:22,008 --> 01:19:26,329
It's not really supposed
to go beyond 4,000 revs.

758
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:34,128
Till the 1,000-mile inspection.

759
01:19:37,524 --> 01:19:38,967
Please look out!

760
01:19:41,778 --> 01:19:45,932
I was rather hoping to keep it
for a year or so, I...

761
01:19:49,035 --> 01:19:53,106
I wonder if I might get you
a taxi or something.

762
01:20:37,709 --> 01:20:39,485
Hang on.

763
01:20:46,676 --> 01:20:49,746
- I feel sick.
- Not in here!

764
01:21:30,303 --> 01:21:32,038
Oh, nuts!

765
01:21:33,974 --> 01:21:36,125
Oh, no!

766
01:22:04,838 --> 01:22:06,573
I waited a year for delivery.

767
01:22:16,891 --> 01:22:18,876
Very good. Thank you.

768
01:22:20,228 --> 01:22:26,426
Well, Lieutenant, how did you enjoy
your sightseeing tour?

769
01:22:26,651 --> 01:22:28,887
The view from the bridge was terrific.

770
01:22:28,987 --> 01:22:31,431
Incidentally, regarding that automobile,

771
01:22:31,531 --> 01:22:33,725
where would you liked it shipped?

772
01:22:34,454 --> 01:22:36,477
Well, you bought it, you know.

773
01:22:47,213 --> 01:22:49,074
Ooh, handsome.

774
01:22:49,174 --> 01:22:50,575
Freddy!

775
01:22:56,181 --> 01:22:58,041
- Yes, Mike?
- Nothing, guv.

776
01:23:04,397 --> 01:23:08,593
It's not fair. My eyes are murdering me,
looking at all those bloody pictures.

777
01:23:09,235 --> 01:23:10,845
You'll smoke when I tell you.

778
01:23:10,945 --> 01:23:12,514
Listen, I know my rights.

779
01:23:12,614 --> 01:23:15,183
You start talking to me about rights,

780
01:23:15,283 --> 01:23:18,478
and I'll tear you limb from limb.

781
01:23:18,578 --> 01:23:20,730
Now, who did you sell those plans to?

782
01:23:22,248 --> 01:23:24,442
I don't know what the bloody hell
you're talking about, man.

783
01:23:24,542 --> 01:23:27,361
Poor, ignorant, wee laddie, isn't he?

784
01:23:27,629 --> 01:23:29,990
They do have libraries inside, Freddy,

785
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:33,827
and I'll put you away for so long,
you'll come out a bloody PhD!

786
01:23:40,392 --> 01:23:41,793
Swann.

787
01:23:42,185 --> 01:23:44,838
I'd tell that fellow
what he wants to know.

788
01:23:44,938 --> 01:23:47,132
He likes to hurt people.

789
01:23:47,232 --> 01:23:50,259
Today at a bar, there was a fight.

790
01:23:50,819 --> 01:23:53,179
He bit a fellow's ear off.

791
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:54,347
Him?

792
01:23:54,447 --> 01:23:56,265
And that's not all.

793
01:23:59,994 --> 01:24:01,729
What, him?

794
01:24:03,707 --> 01:24:07,652
We'll be in touch. No more calls.

795
01:24:08,503 --> 01:24:11,906
Look, I've really had you, you creep.

796
01:24:12,006 --> 01:24:13,407
Okay.

797
01:24:14,551 --> 01:24:15,952
Okay.

798
01:24:16,636 --> 01:24:18,246
He gave me £100 to sell him the plans.

799
01:24:18,346 --> 01:24:20,373
- Who did?
- Charlie.

800
01:24:20,974 --> 01:24:23,042
Charlie Kane.

801
01:24:24,144 --> 01:24:25,920
Put him up.

802
01:24:29,232 --> 01:24:30,425
That's him. That's Charlie.

803
01:24:30,525 --> 01:24:31,635
- Take him away.
- All right, come on.

804
01:24:31,735 --> 01:24:35,680
And that's our man,
that's the fellow that nailed Drexel.

805
01:24:35,989 --> 01:24:37,849
- Are you sure?
- I saw him.

806
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:41,227
Boy, oh boy,
it's really coming together.

807
01:24:41,327 --> 01:24:43,813
That was Fields. His friends
are calling at 11:00 tomorrow

808
01:24:43,913 --> 01:24:46,232
with instructions for the next payment.

809
01:24:46,416 --> 01:24:48,276
Give us time
to put a tracer on the call?

810
01:24:48,376 --> 01:24:51,821
I wish we could.
They're calling on a marine frequency.

811
01:24:51,921 --> 01:24:53,656
They ain't amateurs.

812
01:26:59,799 --> 01:27:01,701
Hello, Jim. Where are you going?

813
01:27:01,801 --> 01:27:04,370
Have you got the keys to your car?
I forgot my notebook.

814
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:05,872
Sure, I'll get it.

815
01:27:05,972 --> 01:27:08,958
No, you'll get your hair wet.

816
01:27:13,104 --> 01:27:14,880
You wanna bet?

817
01:28:51,077 --> 01:28:53,062
Jenny, look out!

818
01:29:24,777 --> 01:29:27,513
Jenny! You all right?

819
01:29:29,615 --> 01:29:30,850
Are you all right?

820
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:33,185
- No.
- What's the matter?

821
01:29:33,286 --> 01:29:34,979
Well, look at my hat.

822
01:29:35,079 --> 01:29:38,190
Oh, your hat.

823
01:29:40,209 --> 01:29:42,278
Let's get out of this.

824
01:29:43,921 --> 01:29:45,656
Yes, sir.

825
01:29:47,508 --> 01:29:50,244
Damn it, I'm having to take more flak

826
01:29:50,344 --> 01:29:54,082
than an air gunner over Normandy
on this case. Forget the Commissioner.

827
01:29:54,182 --> 01:29:56,084
Now, we've got the Home Secretary

828
01:29:56,184 --> 01:30:00,254
blowing his top, demanding to know
what kind of a lunatic I've turned loose.

829
01:30:00,354 --> 01:30:02,090
This isn't Chicago, you know, Brannigan.

830
01:30:02,190 --> 01:30:03,800
That's right, Commander.

831
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:06,469
You can't buy a decent hamburger
anyplace around here.

832
01:30:06,569 --> 01:30:07,679
You're a bloody magnet for trouble.

833
01:30:07,779 --> 01:30:11,182
First the man hired to kill you
blows up an apartment,

834
01:30:11,282 --> 01:30:14,978
and then you demolish an automobile
in what must be one of the most

835
01:30:15,078 --> 01:30:17,772
brazen, reckless stunts
in the annals of this city.

836
01:30:17,872 --> 01:30:18,982
Look, Commander...

837
01:30:19,082 --> 01:30:20,692
And then, last night,
you turn a perfectly peaceful

838
01:30:20,792 --> 01:30:22,527
London street into a shooting gallery.

839
01:30:22,627 --> 01:30:24,529
And if I hadn't done some shooting,

840
01:30:24,629 --> 01:30:26,864
Jenny would be lying
on a marble slab right now.

841
01:30:26,964 --> 01:30:29,867
Exactly. Simply because she
was mistaken for you.

842
01:30:29,967 --> 01:30:32,912
I've asked you politely.
Now I'll ask you impolitely,

843
01:30:33,012 --> 01:30:34,580
give me that gun.

844
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:36,081
I haven't got it.

845
01:30:41,479 --> 01:30:42,964
Well?

846
01:30:43,064 --> 01:30:46,300
This just arrived
from the FBI in Washington, DC, guv.

847
01:30:46,651 --> 01:30:47,969
You got a name for him?

848
01:30:48,069 --> 01:30:51,222
Name of John Gorman.
An habitué of New Orleans, Louisiana.

849
01:30:51,322 --> 01:30:52,932
- Last known address...
- Do you know him?

850
01:30:53,032 --> 01:30:54,726
Well, I know about him.

851
01:30:54,826 --> 01:30:57,437
The word is that he's a stud
who won't quit.

852
01:30:57,537 --> 01:31:00,398
Well, we'll pick him up. Send out
a top-priority signal to all stations.

853
01:31:00,498 --> 01:31:01,482
Right away, sir.

854
01:31:04,544 --> 01:31:05,945
Yes?

855
01:31:09,882 --> 01:31:12,535
Joseph Brannigan, long distance.

856
01:31:14,387 --> 01:31:15,788
Hello?

857
01:31:16,722 --> 01:31:20,459
Hello, big stuff. Sure, fine.

858
01:31:20,893 --> 01:31:22,170
You did?

859
01:31:22,270 --> 01:31:23,879
Well, what's the dope?

860
01:31:25,439 --> 01:31:27,759
Well, now let me get this straight, now.

861
01:31:27,859 --> 01:31:30,010
Jupiter Equity Fund.

862
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:36,141
He bought 20,000 shares at $49,
sold them at $3.

863
01:31:37,410 --> 01:31:40,855
That makes Melvin a living,
breathing pauper.

864
01:31:40,955 --> 01:31:43,399
Sure, I will. Be home soon.

865
01:31:44,333 --> 01:31:45,734
Your son?

866
01:31:46,419 --> 01:31:47,779
What's his line of work?

867
01:31:47,879 --> 01:31:49,113
Ballet.

868
01:31:49,213 --> 01:31:50,490
I should have guessed.

869
01:31:50,590 --> 01:31:54,202
No, he's Assistant
District Attorney for Cook County.

870
01:31:54,302 --> 01:31:57,329
Anything in that conversation
I should know about?

871
01:31:57,889 --> 01:32:00,666
Commander, I wish it were Christmas.

872
01:32:00,766 --> 01:32:03,794
Have I got some
kind of a present for you.

873
01:32:26,792 --> 01:32:29,820
Yes. Right, thank you.

874
01:32:31,130 --> 01:32:32,657
Mr. Fields is on his way up, sir.

875
01:32:32,757 --> 01:32:34,408
Do you know where he's parked?

876
01:32:34,508 --> 01:32:36,785
- Nine, lower level.
- Right.

877
01:32:44,644 --> 01:32:46,129
Excuse me.

878
01:32:46,229 --> 01:32:47,880
Sorry.

879
01:32:49,190 --> 01:32:51,425
Got to the bank at the stroke of 10:00,

880
01:32:51,525 --> 01:32:55,721
and it took eight clerks
until now to get this package together.

881
01:32:56,447 --> 01:32:58,850
We were worried about you, Melvin.

882
01:32:58,950 --> 01:33:00,893
Make yourself right at home, Brannigan.

883
01:33:00,993 --> 01:33:02,645
I have.

884
01:33:03,663 --> 01:33:07,566
We're now ready and willing
to make the payment.

885
01:33:11,671 --> 01:33:15,407
Mr. Fields,
we have some new information.

886
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:20,412
And we are now very close to a breakthrough
in this case. Very close.

887
01:33:23,849 --> 01:33:26,919
Within four hours, or five, at the most,

888
01:33:27,019 --> 01:33:30,089
we expect to have Mr. Larkin home safe.

889
01:33:31,857 --> 01:33:34,385
I strongly suggest, therefore, that,

890
01:33:34,485 --> 01:33:36,429
in the best interests of your client,

891
01:33:36,529 --> 01:33:39,765
you delay payment for those few hours.

892
01:33:40,032 --> 01:33:41,601
No way.

893
01:33:41,701 --> 01:33:44,770
This time I do exactly
what they tell me.

894
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:50,901
You pay that money now,
and you'll get Larkin back in chunks.

895
01:33:52,670 --> 01:33:56,407
The Lieutenant quotes chapter
and verse, Mr. Fields.

896
01:33:56,507 --> 01:33:59,618
This is a gentleman who rejoices
in the name of Charlie the Handle.

897
01:34:00,344 --> 01:34:03,455
Identified as a member
of the kidnap team.

898
01:34:03,806 --> 01:34:06,709
He will lead us to Mr. Larkin.

899
01:34:07,059 --> 01:34:09,420
Kind of unusual, Melvin.

900
01:34:10,354 --> 01:34:14,133
Couple of professional cops telling you
what's best for your client.

901
01:34:14,233 --> 01:34:15,509
Knock it off, Brannigan.

902
01:34:15,609 --> 01:34:17,845
If Larkin's friends in the States
find out I'm in bed with the Yard,

903
01:34:17,945 --> 01:34:20,305
they'll part my hair with a blowtorch.

904
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,686
It's all there,
you don't have to count it.

905
01:34:25,786 --> 01:34:27,939
Well, if you lose Larkin and that loot,

906
01:34:28,039 --> 01:34:31,317
they'll part more than your hair
with that blowtorch.

907
01:34:31,417 --> 01:34:35,488
Earthy, but accurate, I would have thought.
If you'll accept my apologies,

908
01:34:35,588 --> 01:34:38,782
Mr. Fields, I really must insist
that you give us the time.

909
01:34:39,592 --> 01:34:41,869
Something's coming in, sir.

910
01:34:41,969 --> 01:34:43,370
Put it on the speaker.

911
01:34:45,890 --> 01:34:49,668
Calling Mel Fields on 17.35.

912
01:34:49,894 --> 01:34:51,462
Now you contact us

913
01:34:51,562 --> 01:34:57,718
on marine frequency 15.2. Repeat, 15.2.

914
01:34:58,152 --> 01:35:00,930
We will use different frequencies
to contact you,

915
01:35:01,030 --> 01:35:04,558
and you will have only four seconds
to make the change.

916
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:08,061
Calling Mel Fields.

917
01:35:08,954 --> 01:35:12,858
Calling Mel Fields on 17.35.
Are you there, Fields?

918
01:35:16,754 --> 01:35:18,030
This is Mel Fields.

919
01:35:18,130 --> 01:35:21,867
Now, I'm going to give it to you
just once, so get it good.

920
01:35:23,010 --> 01:35:25,621
This is how you make the drop.

921
01:35:26,055 --> 01:35:29,666
You leave the hotel
in exactly 10 minutes.

922
01:35:31,352 --> 01:35:35,047
And make sure you come alone.
Have you got that, Fields?

923
01:35:36,399 --> 01:35:38,258
Yes, I've got it.

924
01:35:39,527 --> 01:35:41,929
But I've run into a slight snag.

925
01:35:42,488 --> 01:35:44,598
What's the problem?

926
01:35:45,241 --> 01:35:46,642
There's no problem.

927
01:35:46,742 --> 01:35:50,854
But the bank needs four or five hours
more to get the money together.

928
01:35:51,831 --> 01:35:53,733
What do you think, Geef? Coppers?

929
01:35:53,833 --> 01:35:55,234
For his sake, I hope not.

930
01:35:55,334 --> 01:35:57,111
Listen, Fields...

931
01:35:57,211 --> 01:36:00,447
Come on, Mel.
Bring the money here. Bring it!

932
01:36:03,801 --> 01:36:06,871
All right. You've just
bought yourself four hours.

933
01:36:06,971 --> 01:36:08,413
And then you've had it.

934
01:36:12,852 --> 01:36:13,961
Then you've had it.

935
01:36:19,942 --> 01:36:21,343
All right.

936
01:36:22,027 --> 01:36:25,138
You've got four hours
to get Larkin back.

937
01:36:26,157 --> 01:36:29,560
But if you don't, I make the payment.

938
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:32,229
And I won't tell you where or when.

939
01:36:32,329 --> 01:36:33,522
Fair enough.

940
01:36:33,622 --> 01:36:35,274
And, Commander Swann,

941
01:36:36,083 --> 01:36:39,820
I want your word that there'll be
no surveillance of any kind.

942
01:36:40,171 --> 01:36:41,947
You have my word, sir.

943
01:36:43,215 --> 01:36:46,451
Oh, and be sure to call room service
if you need anything.

944
01:36:50,347 --> 01:36:51,915
I will.

945
01:36:54,685 --> 01:36:56,587
Find anything?

946
01:36:59,815 --> 01:37:02,551
She's clean, sir. Except for this.

947
01:37:04,487 --> 01:37:06,555
Long-range homing device.

948
01:37:09,909 --> 01:37:12,644
You can't trust anybody these days.

949
01:37:36,810 --> 01:37:39,087
Stay back, not too close.

950
01:40:13,926 --> 01:40:15,869
It's okay. He's alone.

951
01:41:20,325 --> 01:41:23,896
Well, come on, make the payoff
and let's get the hell out of here.

952
01:41:23,996 --> 01:41:25,772
Not yet, Ben.

953
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:30,194
What do you mean, not yet?

954
01:41:30,294 --> 01:41:32,445
Charlie. Geef.

955
01:41:33,338 --> 01:41:36,199
- You're early, Fields.
- Yeah.

956
01:41:36,759 --> 01:41:38,327
Has he been a good boy?

957
01:41:38,427 --> 01:41:40,245
He never raised a finger.

958
01:41:40,345 --> 01:41:43,415
Oh, bad joke, Geef.

959
01:41:47,269 --> 01:41:49,212
Good job, Charlie.

960
01:41:54,359 --> 01:41:55,386
Well, come on, get them off!

961
01:41:55,486 --> 01:41:57,482
Get back,

962
01:41:57,582 --> 01:42:00,824
on your big fat... rear.

963
01:42:06,872 --> 01:42:08,315
Well.

964
01:42:11,210 --> 01:42:13,278
What's going on?

965
01:42:15,839 --> 01:42:19,284
You know, I think it's about time.

966
01:42:19,384 --> 01:42:21,077
Yes.

967
01:42:22,054 --> 01:42:24,297
But this is my party, Charlie.

968
01:42:27,392 --> 01:42:28,835
Ben,

969
01:42:31,897 --> 01:42:33,632
the first time we met,

970
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:37,802
you told me something
I've never forgotten.

971
01:42:37,903 --> 01:42:40,722
It's my golden rule, you might say.

972
01:42:41,490 --> 01:42:44,935
Never trust anybody.

973
01:43:02,094 --> 01:43:03,287
Mel, have you gone out of your...

974
01:43:25,534 --> 01:43:28,353
We pulled it off, Ben. We did it!

975
01:43:29,955 --> 01:43:33,025
Oh, I'm sorry about your finger, Ben.
I'm really sorry.

976
01:43:33,125 --> 01:43:36,111
I bet you are, yeah.
For a million bucks, it was worth it.

977
01:43:36,211 --> 01:43:39,864
And don't forget the first payment
I've got stashed away.

978
01:43:40,924 --> 01:43:42,201
How do I get this thing off?

979
01:43:42,301 --> 01:43:43,786
The key's over by the mirror.

980
01:43:43,886 --> 01:43:47,831
It's first class for you
all the way to South America

981
01:43:48,473 --> 01:43:50,375
and on into the sunset.

982
01:43:52,269 --> 01:43:55,839
And this makes up for that bath
I took in that Jupiter stock.

983
01:43:55,939 --> 01:43:58,550
Yeah, sorry about that.

984
01:43:58,650 --> 01:44:00,093
We got wall-to-wall alibis.

985
01:44:00,193 --> 01:44:03,222
Oh, Scotland Yard will swear
that I cooperated.

986
01:44:03,322 --> 01:44:04,640
I made the payments.

987
01:44:04,740 --> 01:44:09,102
And even that big clown Brannigan
backs up our story.

988
01:44:09,202 --> 01:44:11,479
As long as he's alive.

989
01:44:13,582 --> 01:44:19,112
You know, Mel, for a minute,
when you had that gun on me,

990
01:44:20,839 --> 01:44:23,241
I thought you were gonna get greedy.

991
01:44:24,343 --> 01:44:27,245
You know, for a minute, Ben,
I was tempted.

992
01:44:28,055 --> 01:44:31,750
But what the hell kind of world would it be
if you couldn't trust somebody?

993
01:45:18,522 --> 01:45:20,173
We've been had.

994
01:45:24,695 --> 01:45:26,096
Knock knock.

995
01:45:26,405 --> 01:45:28,056
Brannigan!

996
01:45:28,156 --> 01:45:29,975
I wouldn't.

997
01:45:30,075 --> 01:45:32,685
Unless you wanna sing soprano.

998
01:45:32,995 --> 01:45:36,356
Earthy, but I agree with my friend.

999
01:45:53,557 --> 01:45:56,167
They're all yours, Lieutenant.

1000
01:46:01,231 --> 01:46:03,716
Don't worry about me, James.

1001
01:46:04,109 --> 01:46:05,593
Bye-bye.

1002
01:46:08,447 --> 01:46:10,890
And I mean bye-bye.

1003
01:46:17,247 --> 01:46:20,192
That fella don't quit easy, does he?

1004
01:46:20,292 --> 01:46:22,110
Well, do you think
you can hang on to them

1005
01:46:22,210 --> 01:46:24,905
until I can get them
a couple of airplane tickets?

1006
01:46:25,005 --> 01:46:27,324
Oh, I think we can manage that, yes.

1007
01:46:27,424 --> 01:46:29,451
I just hope you don't lose them
back in the Colonies.

1008
01:46:30,635 --> 01:46:31,745
Safe trip.

1009
01:46:31,845 --> 01:46:33,329
Thank you.

1010
01:46:51,698 --> 01:46:54,017
How about a lift, Yank?

1011
01:47:15,722 --> 01:47:17,123
Jim!

1012
01:47:28,568 --> 01:47:29,886
Jim! Jim!

1013
01:47:29,986 --> 01:47:31,263
I'm all right.

1014
01:47:34,324 --> 01:47:36,059
Over here!

1015
01:47:40,872 --> 01:47:42,273
Now!

1016
01:47:43,583 --> 01:47:45,485
Get behind that car!

1017
01:50:05,267 --> 01:50:09,629
Well, I'm going to miss this old town.

1018
01:50:10,313 --> 01:50:12,465
It's going to miss you.

1019
01:50:13,692 --> 01:50:17,304
I'm not sure if I agree with what
my old dad said about you Yanks.

1020
01:50:17,404 --> 01:50:20,932
You mean that part
about us being overpaid?

1021
01:50:21,032 --> 01:50:23,267
No, over here.

1022
01:50:24,411 --> 01:50:27,105
Jenny, it's been great.

1023
01:50:27,205 --> 01:50:28,747
It has.

1024
01:50:28,748 --> 01:50:30,316
So long.
