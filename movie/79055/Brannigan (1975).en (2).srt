1
00:02:09,494 --> 00:02:12,329
This is Captain Moretti to unit five.

2
00:02:12,455 --> 00:02:16,952
Pick up Brannigan. Use a forklift
if you have to, but get him.

3
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:20,577
APB on Lieutenant James Brannigan.

4
00:02:20,714 --> 00:02:24,665
Brannigan.
Cream sports. You know the licence.

5
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:52,874
- Knock, knock.
- Breaking and entering is against the law. Brannigan.

6
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,002
I rang. You didn't answer.

7
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:58,169
I was working.

8
00:02:58,298 --> 00:03:00,374
Doing your own engraving now?

9
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:04,970
Hey! Wouldn't know
old Abe without his mole.

10
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:07,888
Where's Larkin?

11
00:03:11,688 --> 00:03:15,816
No serial number, no prints,
can't be traced...

12
00:03:15,943 --> 00:03:18,612
Nobody'll know who dumped you.

13
00:03:18,737 --> 00:03:20,777
I don't spook, Brannigan.

14
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:23,314
Oh, all right.

15
00:03:23,451 --> 00:03:28,826
The government wants Larkin for taxes.
The Chicago police want him for extortion.

16
00:03:28,957 --> 00:03:33,370
Cut out the dedicated-cop act. Everybody
in this town knows you want Larkin.

17
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,372
And the grand jury finally indicts him
and he disappears like a short beer.

18
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:41,589
And I'll give you five seconds
to tell me where. You count.

19
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,845
Hey, wait a minute. Wait, OK.

20
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,222
- He left town.
- How?

21
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:52,921
- I don't know.
- Where?

22
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:57,522
I don't know. No, wait a minute.
I don't know. You gota believe me.

23
00:03:57,656 --> 00:04:00,112
All right. Cool it.

24
00:04:02,578 --> 00:04:09,080
You must be getin' old, Angell,
tryin' to push second-rate paper like this.

25
00:04:09,836 --> 00:04:12,707
Manny, this is Warehouse 17, Polk Street.

26
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:16,125
- I got a paperhanger.
- Turn around, big man.

27
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,676
- Angell, you're a real bush-leaguer.
- Yeah?

28
00:04:20,932 --> 00:04:25,725
- You know somethin'? I don't think it's loaded.
- You dirty, lousy Mick!

29
00:04:25,854 --> 00:04:29,021
You got no rules! You got no...

30
00:04:30,484 --> 00:04:33,770
Jim? Jim, are you all right?

31
00:04:34,989 --> 00:04:37,527
Are you all right, Jim?

32
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:41,871
Now listen, Jim, Moretti's steaming. 
He's got the whole Chicago PD looking for you.

33
00:04:41,997 --> 00:04:45,034
- Nice to be wanted.
- You're wanted all right.

34
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:49,035
- There's an APB out on you.
- Listen, Brannigan, you're dead.

35
00:04:49,172 --> 00:04:51,710
There's a contract out on you.

36
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:55,585
Try explaining that to your parole officer.

37
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:59,054
Larkin's put up 25 Gs
to get you knocked off.

38
00:04:59,183 --> 00:05:03,644
You're gonna be walking down the street,
or sleeping, or siting on the can,

39
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:07,223
and the next minute,
Brannigan, you are dead!

40
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:09,482
You lousy Mick, you!

41
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:25,002
Brannigan.

42
00:05:25,003 --> 00:05:27,958
He's on the inside, far end of 17.

43
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,379
Not him.

44
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:32,383
Who?

45
00:05:32,512 --> 00:05:36,296
You. The captain wants to see you. Now.

46
00:05:38,602 --> 00:05:42,303
- You got a warrant?
- I don't need a warrant, Jim.

47
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:44,978
- You're a public menace.
- All right.

48
00:05:45,109 --> 00:05:47,481
- Get in.
- It's my car.

49
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:50,483
Joe will bring your car.

50
00:05:54,494 --> 00:05:57,365
Careful with the paint job.

51
00:06:50,182 --> 00:06:55,722
British Airways flight 570,
nonstop 747 to London,

52
00:06:55,854 --> 00:06:58,642
will depart from the B concourse.

53
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:03,272
Ah, you made it.

54
00:07:03,405 --> 00:07:06,406
All right, Captain. You goin' someplace?

55
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:08,573
No, Lieutenant.

56
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:11,867
- You are.
- I am?

57
00:07:16,628 --> 00:07:21,871
- What is this, Moreti?
- Passport, airline ticket, 500 expenses.

58
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:25,804
- I packed a bag for you.
- That is my bag.

59
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:30,723
I put everything in that was clean.
Here, don't catch cold.

60
00:07:30,852 --> 00:07:33,474
Moreti, you're gonna make somebody
a nice litle wife.

61
00:07:33,605 --> 00:07:36,690
- I'm doin' you a favour, Jim.
- Yeah.

62
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:40,939
- Ben Larkin got out of town a couple of days ago.
- I know that.

63
00:07:41,072 --> 00:07:44,026
- He's in London. Scotland Yard's got him.
- London?

64
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:46,282
You got extradition papers.

65
00:07:46,411 --> 00:07:51,323
Miss Allen? I thought you might like
to bring him back and personally kick him in a cell.

66
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,665
- Miss Allen, Lieutenant Brannigan.
- Hi.

67
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:56,120
- She'll find a seat for you.
- Hi.

68
00:07:56,255 --> 00:07:58,544
Just follow me, Lieutenant.

69
00:07:58,675 --> 00:08:00,714
Anywhere.

70
00:09:12,674 --> 00:09:14,713
Nice day.

71
00:09:16,011 --> 00:09:19,594
- Want to walk, Mel?
- All right. You're on.

72
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:36,278
By the right!

73
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,952
Keep up, there!

74
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,457
First order of business -
call off the wolves.

75
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,508
Even the elevator man looks
like he's from Scotland Yard.

76
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:55,173
It may not be as simple as that.

77
00:09:55,305 --> 00:09:58,222
What broke loose?

78
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,426
The word was in the street, Ben.

79
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,099
Somebody talked, somebody listened.

80
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:10,105
Chicago is sending Jim Brannigan over
with extradition papers and handcuffs.

81
00:10:10,238 --> 00:10:12,278
He'll be at Heathrow any time now.

82
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:15,029
I told you I wanted
that big Irish bastard wasted.

83
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,997
It's being taken care of, Ben.
That won't help your extradition problem.

84
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:24,826
There'll only be a dozen Chicago cops
on the next flight with more papers.

85
00:10:24,963 --> 00:10:29,459
Well, I'm not running. I like this town.
I like the women, the clubs, the action.

86
00:10:29,593 --> 00:10:33,840
- I always did.
- Ben, please. Listen to what I worked out.

87
00:10:35,725 --> 00:10:37,848
Now, in Devon,

88
00:10:37,977 --> 00:10:43,220
at an airport nobody's used for years,
I've got a pilot who'll take you to Ireland

89
00:10:43,358 --> 00:10:46,359
where you'll skip
immigration and customs.

90
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:50,152
Then you'll head on south
to Ecuador, Venezuela...

91
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:55,657
Oh, that's just great. I end up eating
bananas, listening to my arteries harden.

92
00:10:55,789 --> 00:11:02,373
Ben... I'm talking to you as your lawyer,
your friend, not a tour guide.

93
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:07,544
The Cook County grand jury
can't touch you down there.

94
00:11:11,264 --> 00:11:14,431
Look, the boys will take care of you.

95
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,352
They have to. They've got
more skeletons than most graveyards.

96
00:11:19,482 --> 00:11:23,231
- And you know what closets they're hanging in.
- Fields,

97
00:11:23,361 --> 00:11:28,604
we didn't build this organisation by
running the grand juries to save our hides.

98
00:11:28,742 --> 00:11:31,946
- We stick together.
- That's what I'm saying.

99
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,831
To the boys, you're still number one.

100
00:11:34,957 --> 00:11:37,709
They'll see that you live like a king.

101
00:11:37,835 --> 00:11:40,374
They'll use me as a conduit.

102
00:11:40,505 --> 00:11:44,918
I'll funnel the cash to Switzerland,
launder it in Panama,

103
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:49,180
and ship it to you by bank drafts
or leters of credit, whichever you prefer.

104
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:52,142
That's good. That's good.

105
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:58,475
You know, Mel, those bananas
will taste a hell of a lot beter

106
00:11:58,609 --> 00:12:01,729
when I know Brannigan's lying
in some gutter.

107
00:12:01,862 --> 00:12:04,104
It's done.

108
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,989
- Who you got?
- Gorman. We used him before.

109
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:10,789
Good. He's a pro.

110
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:15,704
Enough of the walking. Let's ride.

111
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:49,311
British Airways flight number BA570
from Chicago {\1c&H0000FF&}is{\r} now arriving at gate No.two.

112
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:53,168
Is flight 570 in yet?

113
00:12:53,295 --> 00:12:56,415
- Yes, it's just arrived.
- Could you make the announcement,then?

114
00:12:56,548 --> 00:12:58,588
Yes.

115
00:13:01,554 --> 00:13:04,010
- Have a nice stay.
- Thank you.

116
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:08,138
Would Mr James Brannigan,
British Airways passenger from Chicago,

117
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,354
please report to the British Airways
information desk?

118
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:15,562
James Brannigan, British Airways
information desk, please.

119
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:19,609
How long are you expecting
to be with us, Mr Gorman?

120
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:26,908
- Mr Gorman?
- Oh, sorry. A week.

121
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:30,834
Business or pleasure, sir?

122
00:13:30,962 --> 00:13:33,204
Strictly pleasure.

123
00:13:34,204 --> 00:13:37,204
Air India Flight No. AI602

124
00:13:39,204 --> 00:13:43,204
for Bombay and Tokyo
now boarding at gate No.8.

125
00:13:48,064 --> 00:13:51,932
- Lieutenant Brannigan?
- Yes. How did you know?

126
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:56,530
Headquarters told me to look for someone
slightly smaller than the Statue of Liberty.

127
00:13:56,657 --> 00:13:59,860
Detective Sergeant Jennifer Thatcher, sir.
Scotland Yard.

128
00:13:59,994 --> 00:14:03,079
They've made real improvements
since I was last here.

129
00:14:03,206 --> 00:14:05,199
Thank you. This way, sir.

130
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,952
Where's my man?
The prisoner, Ben Larkin.

131
00:14:09,087 --> 00:14:12,005
Oh, Commander Swann
is handling the extradition.

132
00:14:12,132 --> 00:14:16,427
- And the return ticket reservations?
- Sir Charles has taken care of that.

133
00:14:16,554 --> 00:14:20,683
- He's expecting you for lunch at his club, sir.
- Sir Charles?

134
00:14:21,518 --> 00:14:23,558
Sir Charles? Sir Charles?

135
00:14:31,487 --> 00:14:35,699
I've been assigned as your driver, Lieutenant.
And to generally take care of you while you're here.

136
00:14:35,826 --> 00:14:40,987
- To keep an eye on me, you mean.
- Well, not quite. It's more of a PR job.

137
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:45,997
Anyway, it'll make a nice change
from the vice squad.

138
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:32,760
- Okay, sir.
- Right.

139
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,602
Mel...

140
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:43,641
I'm the one that's going to take the heat.
Now, nothing can screw up.

141
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,816
Stay cool, Ben.

142
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,697
It's ticking like a Swiss watch.

143
00:15:54,914 --> 00:15:58,829
- Good morning, Mr Larkin.
- Good to see you, Jules.

144
00:16:14,602 --> 00:16:17,354
- Morning, Ben.
- Morning, boys.

145
00:16:19,441 --> 00:16:21,481
Larkin's here.

146
00:16:24,697 --> 00:16:27,782
Get me a box
at the dog races tonight, Gates.

147
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,451
Oh, yeah.

148
00:16:30,578 --> 00:16:36,000
Call Jimmy-the-Bet and tell him
to put L400 on Triple Cross.

149
00:16:37,044 --> 00:16:39,452
Ready when you are, Mr Larkin.

150
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:41,416
Good.

151
00:16:46,012 --> 00:16:48,551
You've been to England before, sir?

152
00:16:48,682 --> 00:16:51,683
That's right, Miss Thatcher -
during the war.

153
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:56,105
Well, I expect you'll find London's changed
quite a bit. But it's basically the same.

154
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:58,439
still a very beautiful city.

155
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:01,356
If there are any places
you'd like to revisit, any pubs or any...

156
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:07,325
Right now, what I'd like is about eight hours of
sleep, a shower and a change of clothes.

157
00:17:07,453 --> 00:17:10,454
And to get my hands in Larkin's lapels.

158
00:17:10,581 --> 00:17:12,146
Yes, sir.

159
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:14,209
Oh.

160
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:17,414
I sound like a bear cub
with a toothache, it's just...

161
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:20,999
I understand, sir.
My father flew with the RAF.

162
00:17:21,802 --> 00:17:23,219
Huh?

163
00:17:23,221 --> 00:17:25,973
He said there were three things
wrong with Yanks.

164
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,135
- Yeah?
- Overpaid, oversexed...

165
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:31,428
and over here.

166
00:17:31,563 --> 00:17:34,233
I really walked into that one.

167
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:36,517
And deserved it. I'm sorry.

168
00:17:36,652 --> 00:17:39,404
Might we start again, sir?

169
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,200
Why? We're doing fine.

170
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,908
I was just thinking - can I call you Jenny?

171
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,496
Of course.

172
00:17:50,626 --> 00:17:53,793
Boy, I knew a great gal named Jenny.

173
00:17:53,921 --> 00:17:55,630
Whoo!

174
00:17:56,925 --> 00:18:00,259
She used to lend me money
when I was broke.

175
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:04,549
Did she contribute
any other... philanthropies?

176
00:18:07,144 --> 00:18:09,600
We were friends.

177
00:18:09,731 --> 00:18:11,770
Good friends.

178
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:17,068
Damn good friends.

179
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:13,550
- Right, Mr Larkin.
- Hello, hello, hello.

180
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:19,225
Lie down facing this way?

181
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,806
- All right.
- And relax.

182
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:30,940
Excuse me, Jackson, I've got
a steam bath out there.

183
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:37,276
Well, the pool's down there, but you'll have to go outside. I'll show you the way. It's right around the back.

184
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:01,511
Excuse me, Tom. There's a delivery.

185
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:04,352
What? I don't know
anything about a delivery.

186
00:20:04,484 --> 00:20:08,268
- Neither do I.
- It's a rush order. Where shall we drop it?

187
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:12,699
Better put it out there.
Through the open door.

188
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,159
Grand Central Station.

189
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:26,213
Hey, muscles. It's a bit tight here.
Can you give us a hand?

190
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:29,011
Excuse me a moment, Mr Larkin.

191
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:36,098
Now, what's all this?

192
00:21:03,925 --> 00:21:05,965
That's great.

193
00:21:07,512 --> 00:21:09,838
Oh, you like that, do you?

194
00:21:26,867 --> 00:21:28,990
Yeah. Good.

195
00:21:30,663 --> 00:21:33,154
How do you like that?

196
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,889
Morning, sir.

197
00:23:02,057 --> 00:23:04,927
Here we are, sir. The Garrick Club.

198
00:23:18,033 --> 00:23:21,616
- See you later, sir.
- Aren't you joining us?

199
00:23:21,745 --> 00:23:24,450
If I walked in there,I'd cause
a dozen heart atacks.

200
00:23:24,582 --> 00:23:27,832
It's a men's club - rules strictly enforced.

201
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,000
Too bad.

202
00:23:34,968 --> 00:23:36,093
Sir?

203
00:23:36,095 --> 00:23:39,678
Brannigan. Jim Brannigan
to see Commander Swann.

204
00:23:39,807 --> 00:23:45,015
Yes,sir. That'd be Sir Charles.
He's in the lounge bar, upstairs.

205
00:23:45,146 --> 00:23:48,480
- Thank you.
- Begging your pardon, sir...

206
00:23:48,608 --> 00:23:52,192
I'm sorry, Mr Brannigan. It's a club rule.

207
00:23:53,364 --> 00:23:55,191
Fine.

208
00:23:55,324 --> 00:23:57,994
Strictly enforced, I presume.

209
00:24:27,235 --> 00:24:30,485
And that was the last I saw of her.

210
00:24:35,202 --> 00:24:37,242
Excuse me.

211
00:24:38,205 --> 00:24:40,875
Lieutenant Brannigan? Right. Charles Swann.

212
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,085
- Pleasant flight?
- Just long.

213
00:24:44,212 --> 00:24:49,373
- Would you like a glass of sherry, then?
- Well, actually, I'd like a boilermaker.

214
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:54,421
That's whisky - neat, you'd say -
and a beer chaser, cold, if you can find it.

215
00:24:54,557 --> 00:24:57,013
- Certainly, sir.
- I think we can manage that.

216
00:24:57,143 --> 00:24:59,266
A good old Polish drink.

217
00:24:59,396 --> 00:25:01,934
now, where do we pick up this Larkin?

218
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:04,189
Well, he's under surveillance.

219
00:25:04,318 --> 00:25:07,568
Surveillance? You come
to the States for a prisoner,

220
00:25:07,697 --> 00:25:10,568
and we'd have him standing by
handcuffed at the airport.

221
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:17,035
Yes, but you see,under our judicial system.
Mr Larkin has the right to apply for bail.

222
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:20,001
Well, unfortunately,
we have the same law.

223
00:25:20,127 --> 00:25:24,125
- That's how we lost him.
- Rather careless, wasn't it?

224
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:27,673
I think you can rest assured
that won't happen here.

225
00:25:27,802 --> 00:25:30,638
- Spot of lunch?
- Why not?

226
00:25:33,142 --> 00:25:36,059
Then we'll pick up your friend Larkin.

227
00:25:40,692 --> 00:25:44,642
- Should I call you Sir Charles?
- Oh, I think Swann will do nicely, thank you.

228
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:49,857
I only use the "sir" for theatre tickets and
table reservations. May I lead the way?

229
00:25:50,411 --> 00:25:51,745
Morning, sir.
Morning.

230
00:25:51,746 --> 00:25:56,622
Actually, the title is a military courtesy
granted to one of my ancient ancestors,

231
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:59,836
probably for holding
somebody's horse at a coronation.

232
00:25:59,963 --> 00:26:01,790
- How's this?
- Thank you.

233
00:26:01,924 --> 00:26:05,210
- No castles or booty?
- No, I'm afraid not.

234
00:26:05,344 --> 00:26:08,132
But every Maundy Thursday,
for some totally unaccountable reason,

235
00:26:08,264 --> 00:26:11,550
I'm granted the inestimable privilege -
morning, Barker - morning,Sir Charles.

236
00:26:11,685 --> 00:26:16,062
of dropping a sprig of myrtle
in the river Thames at Westminster.

237
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:19,226
- The Dover sole is excellent.
- Thank you very much, Dover sole?

238
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,518
Commander, it's my breakfast time.

239
00:26:21,654 --> 00:26:26,198
I'd sure like two over easy,
some bacon crisp, and a short stack.

240
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:32,120
Right. I think what my guest would like
is two eggs, lightly fried on either side,

241
00:26:32,249 --> 00:26:35,998
a couple of rashers of bacon
and a modest portion of pancakes.

242
00:26:36,129 --> 00:26:38,584
- Not too modest on the pancakes.
- Sir.

243
00:26:38,715 --> 00:26:41,716
- Right, sir. And Dover sole for me, please.
- Thank you, sir.

244
00:26:41,843 --> 00:26:46,506
Lieutenant, you shouldn't be wearing
that particular item.

245
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,926
Well, a fellow at the front desk
said I had to put it on.

246
00:26:50,061 --> 00:26:51,970
Not the tie.

247
00:26:52,105 --> 00:26:54,513
The .38 calibre Colt Diamondback.

248
00:26:58,862 --> 00:27:01,698
Commander, I always wear this.

249
00:27:02,908 --> 00:27:08,200
Well, I'm afraid it's placing you in violation of
British law and Scotland Yard regulations.

250
00:27:08,331 --> 00:27:11,167
Well, it isn't in violation
of United States law,

251
00:27:11,293 --> 00:27:15,373
and I work under the Chicago
Police Department regulations

252
00:27:15,506 --> 00:27:18,258
which makes it obligatory.

253
00:27:18,384 --> 00:27:22,050
Then I strongly urge you
to resist any temptation to use it.

254
00:27:23,765 --> 00:27:27,633
Well, I don't think I'll be needing it in here.

255
00:27:28,604 --> 00:27:30,727
Excuse me, Sir Charles.

256
00:27:30,856 --> 00:27:33,608
Gentleman to see you at the door.

257
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,143
Excuse me.

258
00:27:58,095 --> 00:28:02,888
Barker, bring the lieutenant a whisky
and a beer chaser, will you?

259
00:28:03,017 --> 00:28:06,517
You mean a boilermaker, sir.

260
00:28:06,646 --> 00:28:09,137
Make it two.

261
00:28:10,776 --> 00:28:15,106
- What for?
- Mr Larkin has been kidnapped.

262
00:28:21,454 --> 00:28:23,993
It can't happen here, huh?

263
00:28:30,214 --> 00:28:32,705
Well, cheer up.

264
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,216
All we can lose is our jobs.

265
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,775
Oh. Gorman?

266
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,529
Yeah.

267
00:30:14,205 --> 00:30:16,412
A friend of mine said you had a package for me.

268
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:20,539
Two questions - from where and for what?

269
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:23,244
From Chicago, to hit something.

270
00:30:23,382 --> 00:30:25,422
Right on, bucko.

271
00:30:33,018 --> 00:30:35,687
Half now and half at ice time.

272
00:30:36,813 --> 00:30:39,483
When he's on ice, you mean.

273
00:31:01,925 --> 00:31:06,053
- It's a bit light.
- It's just my usual commission.

274
00:31:07,556 --> 00:31:10,474
Off their end, not mine. Don't be difficult, friend.

275
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:14,302
Why don't you stay awhile
and talk to Luana?

276
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,065
Hm?

277
00:31:19,236 --> 00:31:20,861
Oh.

278
00:31:59,155 --> 00:32:02,192
Nice and gentle, love. I'm not kinky.

279
00:32:02,325 --> 00:32:05,031
You are what you're paid to be.

280
00:32:16,675 --> 00:32:20,293
This is all that Larkin
left behind at the athletic club.

281
00:32:20,429 --> 00:32:23,099
We don't know
he was really snatched.

282
00:32:23,224 --> 00:32:28,219
Of course not. But we do still have
that masseur unconscious in hospital.

283
00:32:28,355 --> 00:32:30,015
That's might be just an act.

284
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:34,478
At this particular point I don't think that's an assumption
the Yard can afford to make.

285
00:32:34,611 --> 00:32:37,945
Well, if it was up to me I'd get some men
out thumpin' on the streets,

286
00:32:38,074 --> 00:32:40,399
passing out some e pluribus unum.

287
00:32:40,535 --> 00:32:44,118
That's what 90 percent
of police work is today.

288
00:32:44,247 --> 00:32:49,918
The murder rate in your country, I'm sure,
gives ample testimony to your superior police methods.

289
00:32:50,045 --> 00:32:53,746
Well, Commander, I didn't come
over here to argue methods.

290
00:32:53,883 --> 00:33:00,004
But a certain Ben Larkin is missing, and
I intend to use my best efforts to find him.

291
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:03,474
Without interfering
with the Yard, of course.

292
00:33:03,602 --> 00:33:05,891
Oh, er, Lieutenant.

293
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:10,731
I am still a litle concerned
about a certain item you're wearing.

294
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,945
Oh, well, if that bothers you...

295
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,362
wear it in good health.

296
00:33:17,493 --> 00:33:19,948
The old school tie.

297
00:33:26,878 --> 00:33:30,793
Well, guv, what do you think
of our friend Brannigan?

298
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,383
Well...

299
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,135
he's an American.

300
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:55,402
Sir Charles. Why would
a bona fide lord want to be a cop?

301
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:58,489
Because he's good at it.
Why are you a cop?

302
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:00,780
I don't know. Runs in the family.

303
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:04,831
But it stops right here. My son is a lawyer.

304
00:34:04,962 --> 00:34:07,085
Uh-huh?

305
00:34:07,215 --> 00:34:10,465
Hello, Central? Central 77 here.

306
00:34:11,928 --> 00:34:17,054
Mollie? Do me a favour, will you?
Call Richard and tell him I'll be late.

307
00:34:17,184 --> 00:34:20,269
I don't know. About seven. Thanks.

308
00:34:21,147 --> 00:34:23,721
Monkey wrench?

309
00:34:23,858 --> 00:34:26,266
You mean a spanner?

310
00:34:26,403 --> 00:34:28,811
Did I throw one in your social life?

311
00:34:28,947 --> 00:34:31,070
Well, not quite.

312
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,652
Not that Richard is exactly
a paragon of patience.

313
00:34:34,787 --> 00:34:40,660
Well, just blame it on your Yankee
slave-driver - who still hasn't eaten.

314
00:34:40,794 --> 00:34:43,665
Would you mind grabbing a bite
before we go house-hunting?

315
00:34:43,797 --> 00:34:46,467
I wouldn't mind at all.

316
00:35:29,515 --> 00:35:31,175
Thank you very much, Mrs Cooper.

317
00:35:31,308 --> 00:35:34,310
- Lieutenant, I'll see you in the morning.
- Maybe around nine?

318
00:35:34,437 --> 00:35:36,893
Fine, sir. Good night.

319
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:14,244
Mr Lawyer, the next voice
you hear belongs to Ben Larkin.

320
00:37:14,382 --> 00:37:16,458
You'd better listen.

321
00:37:16,592 --> 00:37:20,341
Fields, I've been grabbed
by a couple of hoods.

322
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:24,968
They're tough, so you do exactly
what I tell you or I'm a dead man.

323
00:37:25,102 --> 00:37:27,309
Now, you got five envelopes with this tape.

324
00:37:27,438 --> 00:37:31,732
First put L50,000 in each envelope -
get old, used bills.

325
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:36,522
Then you make the drop in person. Come alone to the
mailbox in the middle of Piccadilly Circus

326
00:37:36,657 --> 00:37:39,777
at exactly 11.35am tomorrow morning.

327
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:44,952
You got that? Next, stay away
from those damn limey cops.

328
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:47,289
They could screw things up.

329
00:37:47,419 --> 00:37:51,796
There's a gun at my head, Fields,
so don't blow this one.

330
00:37:51,924 --> 00:37:54,593
Or my guys will tear your heart out.

331
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:03,720
- Why did you double-cross him, Fields?
- What does that mean?

332
00:38:03,853 --> 00:38:06,606
Larkin told you
to stay away from the cops.

333
00:38:06,732 --> 00:38:11,643
In Chicago, I would have. But, considering
the reputation of Scotland Yard,

334
00:38:11,779 --> 00:38:17,201
I decided it was in the best interests of
my client to put the mater in their hands.

335
00:38:17,327 --> 00:38:21,539
Oh, you're a real eagle scout, Fields.

336
00:38:21,665 --> 00:38:25,533
- We don't even know that that's Larkin's voice.
- Inspector.

337
00:38:25,669 --> 00:38:29,003
Mr Larkin called in to complain
about our surveillance, sir.

338
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:31,670
The call was routed routinely through Central,

339
00:38:31,801 --> 00:38:35,716
where it was in turn redirected
to the switchboard of our department.

340
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:39,051
In rather sulphurous language,I may say,
Mr Larkin demanded...

341
00:38:39,185 --> 00:38:40,893
Yes, thank you, Mike, thank you.

342
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:45,682
The point is, we taped
Larkin's call, voiceprinted it.

343
00:38:45,817 --> 00:38:47,940
They matched.

344
00:38:49,821 --> 00:38:53,902
Do you think you can raise that money
by tomorrow morning?

345
00:38:54,034 --> 00:38:55,908
That's no problem.

346
00:38:56,037 --> 00:39:00,498
Fortunately Mr Larkin has generous
and influential associates in the States.

347
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:06,082
- Translation, Commander: hoods.
- A bank draft is on its way.

348
00:39:06,215 --> 00:39:10,961
Mob money, squeezed out of hookers
and skimmed off of casinos.

349
00:39:11,095 --> 00:39:15,722
Yes, well, er, I think we perhaps
beter get on with it, Mr Fields.

350
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:18,852
Commander, what will you be doing?

351
00:39:18,979 --> 00:39:23,059
Well, our interests are mutual -
the safe return of Mr Larkin.

352
00:39:23,192 --> 00:39:25,862
We'll keep you informed.

353
00:40:36,148 --> 00:40:38,687
It's a bit dicey.

354
00:40:38,818 --> 00:40:40,977
Not a copper in sight.

355
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:46,693
They're down there, all right.
I can smell 'em.

356
00:41:07,683 --> 00:41:09,926
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

357
00:42:36,699 --> 00:42:41,161
Attention, all units. Attention, all units.
Rolls-Royce approaching the circus.

358
00:43:53,535 --> 00:43:55,099
Drop completed.

359
00:43:55,162 --> 00:43:58,199
Prepare for pick-up phase.

360
00:44:10,596 --> 00:44:13,467
Well, now we'll see.

361
00:44:56,981 --> 00:44:58,808
Mailman's just passed me.

362
00:44:58,941 --> 00:45:01,812
Approaching the island now.

363
00:46:09,562 --> 00:46:12,017
It's too damn simple.

364
00:46:14,025 --> 00:46:18,604
- Pick-up completed.
- Right, job completed. Let's go.

365
00:46:31,753 --> 00:46:33,793
We'll take him.

366
00:50:30,936 --> 00:50:33,392
It's a messenger on a motor scooter.
We're on him.

367
00:50:33,523 --> 00:50:35,562
Right. Get going.

368
00:50:48,247 --> 00:50:51,118
- Like I said...
- Too damn simple.

369
00:50:52,627 --> 00:50:55,201
That's right. Too damn simple.

370
00:51:06,226 --> 00:51:07,850
Don't get too far behind.

371
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:15,850
Give Harry a hand, there.

372
00:52:36,201 --> 00:52:38,988
Hold it!

373
00:52:40,372 --> 00:52:43,492
- Can you swim?
- Yeah.

374
00:52:43,626 --> 00:52:46,544
- Go get it.
- Argh!

375
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:57,342
I'll sink with these boots on!

376
00:52:58,726 --> 00:53:01,300
Oi, give us a hand!

377
00:53:02,147 --> 00:53:04,602
After a few questions.

378
00:53:09,029 --> 00:53:11,817
What's the idea of throwin'
this money in the river?

379
00:53:11,949 --> 00:53:15,283
Money? I don't know nothing
about no money.

380
00:53:15,411 --> 00:53:19,244
Some bloke mailed me instructions
with a L5 note.

381
00:53:32,263 --> 00:53:34,755
- Newspaper!
- What?!

382
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:37,931
They pulled a murphy!

383
00:53:38,062 --> 00:53:40,434
Hey, what about me?

384
00:53:40,564 --> 00:53:42,142
A murphy?

385
00:53:57,124 --> 00:53:58,998
OK.

386
00:54:10,765 --> 00:54:13,968
Yeah,
they tunnelled from underneath.

387
00:54:14,102 --> 00:54:18,645
Yes, of course. And then
they switched envelopes by means of a...

388
00:54:18,774 --> 00:54:20,766
A false botom.

389
00:54:27,116 --> 00:54:29,275
As simple as that.

390
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:31,866
A magnet.

391
00:54:35,542 --> 00:54:39,243
Ruddy sewers.
They'll be miles away by now.

392
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:11,661
I'll be right back.

393
00:55:30,187 --> 00:55:32,760
Hello, Mrs Cooper.

394
00:55:32,898 --> 00:55:36,314
Good afternoon, Mr Brannigan.

395
00:55:36,444 --> 00:55:40,062
- Would you like a coffee?
- Oh, thank you, no.

396
00:55:40,198 --> 00:55:43,365
- Some people are waiting for me.
- Oh, Pity.

397
00:56:58,702 --> 00:57:00,944
Oh, Mrs Cooper?

398
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,119
Yes, Mr Brannigan?

399
00:57:03,249 --> 00:57:07,828
- Did I have any visitors today?
- No, I don't think so.

400
00:57:07,962 --> 00:57:10,038
Thank you.

401
00:57:10,173 --> 00:57:13,044
Oh, there was a man here.

402
00:57:13,176 --> 00:57:16,047
Something about the central heating.

403
00:58:04,066 --> 00:58:08,065
- What happened?
- Your central-heating friend left a present.

404
00:58:08,196 --> 00:58:11,897
- We must call the police.
- He is the police.

405
00:58:12,897 --> 00:58:14,897
I have never seen anything like it in my life.

406
00:58:40,315 --> 00:58:43,067
- You're insured?
- Oh, yes, I am.

407
00:58:45,988 --> 00:58:48,658
- Jim?
- In here.

408
00:59:01,047 --> 00:59:05,674
- What are you doing?
- Well, I'm afraid that the... I'll show you.

409
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:13,426
- You mean he's put another one in there?
- I mean...

410
00:59:17,815 --> 00:59:19,440
Yes.

411
00:59:27,868 --> 00:59:29,493
Yeah.

412
00:59:30,872 --> 00:59:34,656
Larkin paid 25 grand to get me that view.

413
00:59:44,637 --> 00:59:48,255
- All the usual checks being made?
- Yes, sir.

414
00:59:48,391 --> 00:59:50,847
Ah-ah. All being fingerprinted, guv.

415
00:59:50,977 --> 00:59:54,975
I want a complete report on all sales
of gelignite in the past two months.

416
00:59:55,107 --> 00:59:58,357
Right,guv.
And try and trace that damn thing.

417
00:59:58,486 --> 01:00:01,689
- Where is he?
- He's downstairs at Mrs Cooper's, sir.

418
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:05,609
Oh, don't you look nice!

419
01:00:05,744 --> 01:00:08,496
- Well, thank you.
- I'm sorry I haven't a room available.

420
01:00:08,622 --> 01:00:11,457
- but I'm sure I could make room for you in my place.
- Oh, that's very kind of you, but...

421
01:00:11,584 --> 01:00:13,873
- No, really, it'd be a pleasure.
- Lieutenant.

422
01:00:14,003 --> 01:00:17,622
Jennifer, don't you think we ought to show our visitor
a bit of British hospitality?

423
01:00:17,757 --> 01:00:20,593
- Why don't you take him out for a spot of dinner?
- Yes, sir.

424
01:00:20,719 --> 01:00:25,180
Oh, that's very kind of you.
And leave the police work to the Yard.

425
01:00:25,307 --> 01:00:30,136
- Thank you very much, Mrs Cooper.
- Oh, yes, Mrs Cooper, thank you.

426
01:00:31,981 --> 01:00:34,140
Enjoy yourself, Lieutenant.

427
01:00:34,276 --> 01:00:36,315
I will.

428
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:43,618
Perhaps you'd care for a cup of coffee.
Come along.

429
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:46,364
Well...

430
01:01:01,556 --> 01:01:03,964
But it says "for sale".

431
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:07,885
Well, I'm sure I can persuade them to rent it to you for a week, if you don't mind me as your neighbour.

432
01:01:08,021 --> 01:01:11,521
Why should I?
It Puts me closer to my driver.

433
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,789
- It's been a lovely evening, Jim.
- Yeah, pleasant.

434
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,458
And I hate to change the mood.

435
01:01:31,589 --> 01:01:36,418
- But, Jenny, I want you to do me a favour.
- You shouldn't have that, Jim. That's a felony.

436
01:01:36,553 --> 01:01:38,630
- Is that so?
- Yes, that is so.

437
01:01:38,764 --> 01:01:40,804
Commander Swann was not amused.

438
01:01:40,933 --> 01:01:43,471
I had all these names run down
by the department.

439
01:01:43,603 --> 01:01:46,308
They all check out except that one.

440
01:01:46,439 --> 01:01:49,559
- Jimmy-the-Bet.
- That's right. Do you know him?

441
01:01:49,693 --> 01:01:54,402
Yeah. He's a bookie. He's also a grass -
what you would call a stoolie.

442
01:01:54,532 --> 01:01:58,482
He's got his eye on every keyhole
in London. Is it important?

443
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:02,487
Anything that has to do
with Larkin is important.

444
01:02:02,624 --> 01:02:06,705
He's in blackmail, extortion, hard drugs -
you name it, he's in it.

445
01:02:10,091 --> 01:02:14,718
Jenny, I just happen to be working
the other side of the street.

446
01:02:14,846 --> 01:02:16,922
Is that all?

447
01:02:18,266 --> 01:02:23,807
Well, a couple of years ago
I was makin' it tough for him and...

448
01:02:23,939 --> 01:02:26,976
one night he hit back.

449
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,862
Pair of shotguns.

450
01:02:29,988 --> 01:02:32,064
But he obviously missed.

451
01:02:32,199 --> 01:02:36,742
But the rookie riding with me
took a blast in his face.

452
01:02:37,955 --> 01:02:42,203
He left a widow and a couple of nice kids.

453
01:02:43,586 --> 01:02:47,371
I'm sorry, Jim.
You must have been close to him.

454
01:02:47,507 --> 01:02:50,046
Oh, it'd make a good story.

455
01:02:50,177 --> 01:02:52,668
But that's not the reason.

456
01:02:52,805 --> 01:02:56,637
The truth is, I hated his guts
and he didn't like me.

457
01:02:56,768 --> 01:03:00,980
He had a degree in criminology and...
Well, the hell with that. I...

458
01:03:01,106 --> 01:03:03,146
My job was to keep him alive

459
01:03:03,275 --> 01:03:09,361
until he could get smart enough
or tough enough to take care of himself.

460
01:03:10,825 --> 01:03:12,865
I blew it.

461
01:03:17,416 --> 01:03:19,622
What's that for?

462
01:03:19,752 --> 01:03:21,875
I don't know.

463
01:03:22,004 --> 01:03:24,922
You're just so... damn solid.

464
01:03:25,967 --> 01:03:28,007
Fat, you mean.

465
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:32,597
- Telephone for you, sir.
- Thank you.

466
01:03:32,724 --> 01:03:34,385
Hello?

467
01:03:35,352 --> 01:03:37,678
Yes, Inspector.

468
01:03:37,813 --> 01:03:39,853
Yes, right away.

469
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,738
He wants us back at the office.

470
01:03:53,623 --> 01:03:58,285
Yes, well, there's no doubt
that fingerprint is Larkin's.

471
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:02,714
Oh. Forgive me for interrupting
your evening, Lieutenant.

472
01:04:02,841 --> 01:04:09,177
Jenny, the artist has a sketch of our mad bomber up in 194. 
Pick it up for me, will you? Yes, sir.

473
01:04:11,059 --> 01:04:15,887
Your theory that Mr. Larkin may have staged
his own kidnapping doesn't quite work.

474
01:04:16,023 --> 01:04:20,436
- Is that so?
- Someone sent us a personal contribution from Mr. Larkin.

475
01:04:21,821 --> 01:04:24,941
Did you print it?

476
01:04:25,074 --> 01:04:26,984
Of course.

477
01:04:27,118 --> 01:04:29,788
Third finger of the left hand.

478
01:04:31,915 --> 01:04:37,255
And it was accompanied by a demand
for an additional 350,000 quid.

479
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:40,215
That brings the ante up
to a million and a half dollars.

480
01:04:40,342 --> 01:04:46,511
The additional payment was in the nature of a penalty
because Mr Fields consulted the Yard for assistance.

481
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,214
- These gentlemen play rough.
- And smart.

482
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:52,935
They certainly made bloody fools of us
in that Piccadilly caper.

483
01:04:53,064 --> 01:04:57,014
All my years at the Yard,
I've never received a finger in the morning post.

484
01:04:57,152 --> 01:04:59,987
Lord knows what they'll be sending us next.
Ah, thanks.

485
01:05:00,114 --> 01:05:03,068
Well, that's it. It's only based
on your landlady's description, of course.

486
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:08,990
But we've wired copies to Interpol, the Suret?
and the FBI. Does it ring a bell for you?

487
01:05:09,124 --> 01:05:12,908
No, but if Larkin has a contract
on me, he'd hire top talent.

488
01:05:13,045 --> 01:05:15,583
Then I want you on
the next flight to Chicago.

489
01:05:15,714 --> 01:05:19,000
You care, Commander! You really care.

490
01:05:20,011 --> 01:05:23,712
I want you in Chicago alive, you big sod.

491
01:05:23,848 --> 01:05:28,345
I don't want you in London as an unsolved
homicide. We're short-staffed as it is.

492
01:05:28,478 --> 01:05:33,188
We have the same trouble in Chicago,
Commander. Good night.

493
01:05:33,317 --> 01:05:35,191
Good night.

494
01:05:35,319 --> 01:05:37,443
Oh! Lieutenant.

495
01:05:39,908 --> 01:05:43,692
- I'll take that particular item.
- You mean, uh...?

496
01:05:46,415 --> 01:05:48,906
- The notepad.
- Oh.

497
01:05:50,211 --> 01:05:54,920
Yes, I-I, uh... I guess
I picked this up by mistake.

498
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:58,087
Yes, of course. That's what I'd assumed.

499
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,270
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

500
01:06:12,736 --> 01:06:16,521
Darling, I've got a problem.
I've got to stay on duty till 2:00.

501
01:06:16,657 --> 01:06:19,113
Yeah, well, here comes my problem.

502
01:06:19,243 --> 01:06:23,194
- Oh, Jim, this is my fiance, Richard Nelson.
- Jim Brannigan. Og, how are you?

503
01:06:23,331 --> 01:06:26,249
So you're the guy
who's been ruining our love life.

504
01:06:26,376 --> 01:06:31,454
- I'm glad you're not 20 years younger.
- If I were, you'd have to worry.

505
01:06:31,591 --> 01:06:36,218
Well, we're not finished yet.
One more call. Sorry.

506
01:06:36,346 --> 01:06:39,098
- Good night, love.
- Good night.

507
01:06:44,021 --> 01:06:48,102
- OK. Where to?
- Jimmy-the-Bet.

508
01:06:48,234 --> 01:06:51,734
Oh. You watch him.
He's a tough customer.

509
01:07:08,715 --> 01:07:10,755
- Evening, Jimmy.
- I've got no time for bird cops.

510
01:07:10,884 --> 01:07:17,089
- I got a thousand pounds on this fight.
- Jimmy, this isn't social, it's official. Open up.

511
01:07:18,685 --> 01:07:20,974
It still isn't social.

512
01:07:21,104 --> 01:07:23,892
- I'm a cop.
- It shows, flatfoot.

513
01:07:24,024 --> 01:07:27,808
And I found your name
on a notepad of Benny Larkin's.

514
01:07:27,945 --> 01:07:33,071
- Is he one of your customers?
- I got nothing to say to you. Out!

515
01:07:33,201 --> 01:07:38,077
Benny Larkin's been kidnapped.
You're gonna give me some information.

516
01:07:38,206 --> 01:07:43,546
I can ask questions easy or
I can ask 'em hard. Which will it be?

517
01:07:43,671 --> 01:07:46,245
This is what I answer questions with.

518
01:07:46,382 --> 01:07:51,839
It's mighty persuasive. I guess
the questions can wait. But not for long.

519
01:07:56,936 --> 01:07:58,500
Argh!

520
01:07:58,562 --> 01:08:05,100
Now, would you like to try for England's
free dental care or are you gonna answer my questions?

521
01:08:05,237 --> 01:08:07,906
I'll ask you just once.

522
01:08:08,907 --> 01:08:11,944
- Name a name.
- Al Drexel.

523
01:08:12,078 --> 01:08:15,363
- Did you hear another?
- No, I swear it.

524
01:08:15,498 --> 01:08:18,832
- Where can I find this Drexel?
- A pub.

525
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,208
He goes there. The Lamb Tavern.
He goes there midday.

526
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:26,092
Well, thanks, Jimmy.

527
01:08:26,218 --> 01:08:29,422
You know something?
That Jackson's a bum.

528
01:08:30,556 --> 01:08:33,427
He won't make it through the eighth.

529
01:08:34,561 --> 01:08:37,515
Jackson's hurt! He's down!

530
01:08:44,656 --> 01:08:47,573
- Any trouble?
- No trouble.

531
01:08:49,161 --> 01:08:52,530
Little hard to understand his accent.

532
01:09:11,644 --> 01:09:14,729
- That's Scotch rump steak, sir.
- Right, well, I'll have that one, please.

533
01:09:14,856 --> 01:09:20,231
I don't mind this turning into a shopping
tour as long as it ends up with Drexel.

534
01:09:24,533 --> 01:09:27,203
I say. Talk of the devil.

535
01:09:28,204 --> 01:09:31,455
That's him in the grey suit,
walking towards the pub now.

536
01:09:31,583 --> 01:09:35,367
Fine. Would you just give me time
to get a litle friendly?

537
01:09:58,822 --> 01:10:01,064
Mind if I but in, partner?

538
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,773
- It's a free country.
- All right, Navy?

539
01:10:03,911 --> 01:10:06,865
- Yeah, it's a pleasant country.
- I wouldn't argue with that.

540
01:10:06,997 --> 01:10:11,790
Last time I was here, people were
getin' bombed a different way.

541
01:10:18,802 --> 01:10:22,421
- Doris, let's have some service here.
The man's dying of thirst.
- All right, darling, what do you want?

542
01:10:22,556 --> 01:10:25,344
- Well, I want ome Guinness. How about you?
- Same again, please.

543
01:10:25,476 --> 01:10:28,146
- Good. Navy?
- No, I've got enough, thanks.

544
01:10:28,271 --> 01:10:31,059
- How is the second-best navy?
- You should know.

545
01:10:31,191 --> 01:10:33,480
Nice one, Ted.

546
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:36,612
Well, partner, cheers.

547
01:10:39,283 --> 01:10:42,035
Wait a minute, friend. We're havin' a drink.

548
01:10:42,162 --> 01:10:45,246
Drexel, I'd like a few words with you.
Let's step outside, shall we?

549
01:10:45,373 --> 01:10:48,957
- Scotland Yard. Can't you smell it?
- Is it illegal to have a drink?

550
01:10:49,086 --> 01:10:52,787
May I suggest, sir, that you keep out of this?
This is strictly police business.

551
01:10:52,924 --> 01:10:55,593
Oh, tell him to show you his badge.

552
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:58,292
Drexel, I said outside. Now come on.

553
01:10:58,430 --> 01:11:00,387
That cuts it.

554
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:07,226
Sorry. Sorry.

555
01:11:08,441 --> 01:11:10,897
It wasn't me! What you trying to...?

556
01:11:17,826 --> 01:11:22,038
- What's the idea?
- Well, who the hell started it?

557
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:26,160
Awfully sorry.

558
01:11:32,259 --> 01:11:33,823
Henry!

559
01:11:33,823 --> 01:11:33,823


560
01:12:13,805 --> 01:12:15,964
Ah! Guv.

561
01:12:24,234 --> 01:12:26,392
Ah-ah-ah.

562
01:12:27,404 --> 01:12:28,863
Guv.

563
01:12:28,864 --> 01:12:31,782
- Ah, Mike. Have you got it?
- Seems likely, guv.

564
01:12:31,909 --> 01:12:35,278
Gwendolyn Rooke, female,
Caucasian, age 26...

565
01:12:36,748 --> 01:12:41,540
- Well, get on with it, then.
- The subject resides in Balham...

566
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:43,912
- I'm sorry, lady. If I were you, i'd...
- Look out!

567
01:12:44,047 --> 01:12:46,206
Huh? Oh.

568
01:12:51,013 --> 01:12:55,676
...and has access to blueprints
and charts for telephone and sewage conduits...

569
01:12:58,105 --> 01:13:00,810
under Piccadilly Circus.

570
01:13:03,736 --> 01:13:06,821
This place is getin' kinda unfriendly.

571
01:13:08,116 --> 01:13:11,865
- You're right. Where are we goin'?
- Let's go to my place and have a drink.

572
01:13:19,086 --> 01:13:21,459
You all right?

573
01:13:22,090 --> 01:13:25,340
Come on, partner.
We'd  beter get out of here.

574
01:13:37,899 --> 01:13:40,521
- The Yank's got our pigeon.
- As far as I can see.

575
01:13:58,005 --> 01:14:03,795
Yes, well. Perhaps we'd beter look her
over, see what Miss Rooke has to say for herself.

576
01:14:03,928 --> 01:14:09,303
Oh, and, er, Mike, while you're at it,
run this lot of rowdies in, will you?

577
01:14:09,434 --> 01:14:11,474
Right, guv.

578
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:15,149
'Scuse me. How's your wrist?

579
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:38,963
Ah, Constable. Arrest that lot, will you?

580
01:14:38,963 --> 01:14:40,963
Come on, sir. Come on.

581
01:14:41,553 --> 01:14:46,180
It had nothing to do with me!
I'm only here for the beer!

582
01:14:48,019 --> 01:14:54,272
I think you'll find the evidence
is conclusive, sir, if you would just examine the map.

583
01:14:55,277 --> 01:14:57,317
Yes, of course. Thank you.
Thanks, Mike.

584
01:15:01,701 --> 01:15:04,370
Last month, the, erm...

585
01:15:06,122 --> 01:15:09,622
the 16th, to be exact,
you made copies of maps

586
01:15:09,751 --> 01:15:14,794
detailing the electrical and sewage
conduits beneath Piccadilly Circus.

587
01:15:14,924 --> 01:15:18,174
- That's what I'm paid to do, sir.
- Of course.

588
01:15:18,303 --> 01:15:23,642
- But to whom did you give those copies?
- To one of my supervisors, I expect.

589
01:15:23,767 --> 01:15:28,975
Miss Rooke, both you and I know
that that is not true.

590
01:15:33,319 --> 01:15:37,152
Protecting a criminal, Miss Rooke,
is a crime in itself,

591
01:15:37,282 --> 01:15:42,870
and I suggest that in your own
best interests you stop lying to me.

592
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:52,539
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

593
01:15:52,674 --> 01:15:55,841
- Miss Rooke!
- I've always been a good girl, sir.

594
01:15:55,970 --> 01:16:00,098
I'm sure you have, my dear,
but to whom did you give them?

595
01:16:01,935 --> 01:16:04,390
To my boyfriend. Freddy.

596
01:16:07,774 --> 01:16:10,396
Freddy.

597
01:16:10,528 --> 01:16:13,944
- Now, now, come on.
- Whoops! Watch it, partner.

598
01:16:14,073 --> 01:16:16,743
- I'm only just...
- You're a handful.

599
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:25,037
I like Americans. They think big.
Wait till you see what I got here.

600
01:16:25,169 --> 01:16:27,458
- Take a look at this.
- Look at what?

601
01:16:27,588 --> 01:16:32,465
I've got a deal goin' here
that'll make your hair stand on end.

602
01:16:32,594 --> 01:16:33,886
Uh-uh.

603
01:16:33,887 --> 01:16:38,348
Oh, no. You're geting too familiar.
I've only just met you.

604
01:16:38,475 --> 01:16:40,634
We're only acquaintances yet.

605
01:16:40,770 --> 01:16:43,641
Well, you know what I think you need,  fella,
is a cup of coffee.

606
01:16:43,773 --> 01:16:46,858
- I need another drink.Come on.
- I can't stand coffee. Get in the kitchen.

607
01:16:46,985 --> 01:16:52,656
Come on, let's have a fight. Marquis
of Queensberry rules. Let's have a drink.

608
01:16:57,538 --> 01:17:00,742
Give me a minute and I'll fix you right up,
if I can find the coffee.

609
01:17:00,875 --> 01:17:05,087
- I don't want any coffee.
- Maybe you'll have to settle for tea.

610
01:17:29,616 --> 01:17:31,180
I want a drink.

611
01:17:55,937 --> 01:17:59,223
All right, buster, the friendly hour's over.

612
01:17:59,357 --> 01:18:01,397
Wake up.

613
01:18:04,738 --> 01:18:07,194
Come on. Get up.

614
01:18:14,332 --> 01:18:17,417
Hold it up down there!

615
01:18:33,687 --> 01:18:35,976
Get off, you stupid-lookin' mutt.

616
01:18:36,857 --> 01:18:39,064
Whoops! Sorry.

617
01:18:41,321 --> 01:18:43,859
Police, son. Follow that car.

618
01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:46,660
What? Police? What... What car?

619
01:18:48,203 --> 01:18:51,205
- Right-hand drive.
- Of course.

620
01:19:16,109 --> 01:19:20,523
I say, this is actually a new car, you know.

621
01:19:21,324 --> 01:19:25,536
It's not really supposed
to go beyond 4,000 revs...

622
01:19:31,126 --> 01:19:34,578
...till the 1,000-mile inspection.

623
01:19:37,091 --> 01:19:39,547
Please look out. Oh! Agh!

624
01:19:41,346 --> 01:19:45,178
I was rather hoping to keep it
for a year or so. I...

625
01:19:48,437 --> 01:19:52,270
I wonder if I might get you
a taxi or something.

626
01:20:01,285 --> 01:20:03,242
Oh! Argh!

627
01:20:37,075 --> 01:20:38,699
Hang on.

628
01:20:46,252 --> 01:20:49,087
- I feel sick.
- Not in here!

629
01:21:29,508 --> 01:21:31,133
Oh, nuts.

630
01:21:33,763 --> 01:21:35,327
Oh, no!

631
01:22:04,255 --> 01:22:06,925
I waited a year for delivery.

632
01:22:16,185 --> 01:22:18,474
Very good. Thank you.

633
01:22:19,647 --> 01:22:25,900
Well, Lieutenant. How did you, er...
enjoy your sightseeing tour?

634
01:22:26,029 --> 01:22:28,236
The view from the bridge was terrific.

635
01:22:28,365 --> 01:22:33,075
Incidentally, regarding that automobile,
where would you like it shipped?

636
01:22:33,204 --> 01:22:36,075
- Hm?
- Well, you bought it, you know.

637
01:22:46,928 --> 01:22:49,597
- Cor, handsome.
- Freddy.

638
01:22:55,604 --> 01:22:58,060
- Yes, Mike?
- Nothing, guv.

639
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:08,489
It's not fair. My eyes are murderin' me
looking at all those bloody pictures.

640
01:23:08,619 --> 01:23:12,154
- You smoke when I tell you.
- Listen, I know my rights.

641
01:23:12,289 --> 01:23:15,990
you start talking about rights.
And I'll tear you limb from limb.

642
01:23:16,127 --> 01:23:19,543
- Oh, aye?
- Now, who did you sell those plans to?

643
01:23:21,633 --> 01:23:26,759
- I don't know what the blood hell you're talkin' about, man.
- Poor ignorant wee laddie, isn't he?

644
01:23:26,889 --> 01:23:29,297
They do have libraries inside, Freddy,

645
01:23:29,433 --> 01:23:33,017
and I'll put you away for so long,
you'll come out a bloody PhD!

646
01:23:39,737 --> 01:23:41,301
Swann.

647
01:23:41,572 --> 01:23:46,448
I'd tell that fella what he wants to know.
He likes to hurt people.

648
01:23:46,578 --> 01:23:50,077
Today at a bar there was a fight.

649
01:23:50,207 --> 01:23:52,496
He bit a guy's ear off.

650
01:23:52,626 --> 01:23:55,296
- Him?
- And that's not all.

651
01:23:59,342 --> 01:24:00,967
What, him?

652
01:24:02,804 --> 01:24:06,505
We'll be in touch. No more calls.

653
01:24:07,851 --> 01:24:11,185
Look. I've really had you, you creep.

654
01:24:11,314 --> 01:24:12,938
OK.

655
01:24:13,941 --> 01:24:17,525
OK. He gave me L100
to sell him the plans.

656
01:24:17,654 --> 01:24:20,110
- Who did?
- Charlie.

657
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:22,280
Charlie Kane!

658
01:24:23,410 --> 01:24:25,450
Put him up.

659
01:24:28,541 --> 01:24:30,867
- That's him. That's Charlie!
- Take him away. All right, come on.

660
01:24:31,002 --> 01:24:35,083
And that's our man.
That's the fellow that nailed Drexel.

661
01:24:35,215 --> 01:24:37,623
- Are you sure?
- I saw him.

662
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,547
Boy, oh boy, it's really coming together.

663
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:45,638
That was Fields. His friends are calling at 11:00 tomorrow
with instructions for the next payment.

664
01:24:45,769 --> 01:24:48,639
- Give us time to put a tracer on the call?
- I wish we could.

665
01:24:48,772 --> 01:24:53,233
- They're calling on a marine frequency.
- They ain't amateurs.

666
01:26:59,167 --> 01:27:02,537
- Hello, Jim. Where are you going?
- Have you got the keys to your car?

667
01:27:02,671 --> 01:27:05,163
- I forgot my notebook.
- Sure. I'll get it.

668
01:27:05,299 --> 01:27:06,841
No!

669
01:27:06,843 --> 01:27:09,512
You'll get your hair wet!

670
01:27:12,390 --> 01:27:15,226
You wanna bet?

671
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:52,208
Jenny, look out!

672
01:29:24,079 --> 01:29:26,072
Jenny!

673
01:29:26,206 --> 01:29:28,698
You all right?

674
01:29:28,834 --> 01:29:30,874
- Are you all right?
- No.

675
01:29:31,003 --> 01:29:32,747
What's the mater?

676
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,502
- Well, look at my hat.
- Oh.

677
01:29:35,633 --> 01:29:37,673
Your hat.

678
01:29:39,388 --> 01:29:42,093
Let's get out of this.

679
01:29:43,267 --> 01:29:45,307
Yes, sir.

680
01:29:46,896 --> 01:29:51,475
Damm it, I'm having to take more flak
than an air gunner over Normandy on this case.

681
01:29:51,610 --> 01:29:56,272
Forget the commissioner. Now we've got
the Home Secretary blowing his top,

682
01:29:56,407 --> 01:29:59,610
demanding to know what kind
of a lunatic I've turned loose.

683
01:29:59,744 --> 01:30:02,780
- This isn't Chicago, you know, Brannigan.
- That's right, Commander.

684
01:30:02,914 --> 01:30:06,959
- You can't buy a decent hamburger anyplace around here.
- You're a bloody magnet for trouble.

685
01:30:07,085 --> 01:30:10,501
First the man hired to kill you
blows up an apartment.

686
01:30:10,631 --> 01:30:12,670
and then you demolish an automobile

687
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:17,795
in what must be one of the most brazen,
reckless stunts in the annals of this city.

688
01:30:17,931 --> 01:30:21,845
Look, Commander...
And then, last night, you turn a perfectly peaceful London street into a shooting gallery!

689
01:30:21,977 --> 01:30:26,141
And if I hadn't done some shooting, Jenny would be
lying on a marble slab right now!

690
01:30:26,273 --> 01:30:29,191
Exactly! Simply because
she was mistaken for you!

691
01:30:29,318 --> 01:30:33,981
I've asked you politely. Now I'll
ask you impolitely. Give me that gun!

692
01:30:34,115 --> 01:30:36,867
I haven't got it!

693
01:30:40,748 --> 01:30:42,312
Well?

694
01:30:42,416 --> 01:30:45,868
This just arrived
from the FBI in Washington DC,guv.

695
01:30:46,003 --> 01:30:48,495
- Got a name for him?
- Name of John Gorman.

696
01:30:48,631 --> 01:30:51,087
An habitue of New Orleans, Louisiana.

697
01:30:51,218 --> 01:30:54,089
- Last known address...Do you know him?
- Well, I know about him.

698
01:30:54,221 --> 01:30:56,795
The word is that he's a stud who won't quit.

699
01:30:56,932 --> 01:30:59,768
Well. we'll pick him up.
Send out a top-priority signal to all stations.

700
01:30:59,894 --> 01:31:02,219
Right away, sir.

701
01:31:04,024 --> 01:31:05,648
Yes?

702
01:31:09,196 --> 01:31:12,150
Joseph Brannigan, long distance.

703
01:31:13,868 --> 01:31:15,908
Hello.

704
01:31:16,037 --> 01:31:18,077
Hello, big stuff.

705
01:31:18,206 --> 01:31:19,914
Sure. Fine.

706
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:23,078
You did? Well, what's the dope?

707
01:31:23,629 --> 01:31:24,796
Uh-huh.

708
01:31:24,797 --> 01:31:29,590
Well, now let me get this straight, now.
Jupiter Equity Fund.

709
01:31:29,719 --> 01:31:36,497
He bought 20,000 shares at 49,
sold them at three. Whoo!

710
01:31:36,727 --> 01:31:40,096
That makes Melvin
a living, breathing pauper.

711
01:31:40,231 --> 01:31:42,804
Sure, I will. Be home soon.

712
01:31:43,735 --> 01:31:47,104
Your son? What's his line of work?

713
01:31:47,238 --> 01:31:49,777
- Ballet.
- I should have guessed.

714
01:31:49,908 --> 01:31:53,159
No, he's assistant district atorney
for Cook County.

715
01:31:53,287 --> 01:31:57,071
Anything in that conversation
I should know about?

716
01:31:57,208 --> 01:31:59,960
Commander, I wish it were Christmas.

717
01:32:00,086 --> 01:32:03,538
Have I got some kind of a present for you.

718
01:32:26,115 --> 01:32:27,693
Yes.

719
01:32:27,825 --> 01:32:30,151
Right. Thank you.

720
01:32:30,286 --> 01:32:33,703
- Mr Fields is on his way up, sir.
- You know where he's parked.

721
01:32:33,832 --> 01:32:35,872
Nine, lower level.
Right.

722
01:32:43,872 --> 01:32:45,872
Excuse me

723
01:32:47,515 --> 01:32:49,674
Got to the bank at the stroke of 10:00,

724
01:32:49,809 --> 01:32:54,638
but it took eight clerks until now
to get this package together.

725
01:32:54,773 --> 01:32:57,229
We were worried about you, Melvin.

726
01:32:57,359 --> 01:33:00,859
- Make yourself right at home, Brannigan.
- I have.

727
01:33:01,948 --> 01:33:06,076
We are now ready and willing
to make the payment.

728
01:33:09,998 --> 01:33:13,949
Mr Fields, we have some new information,

729
01:33:14,086 --> 01:33:19,793
and we are now very close to
a breakthrough in this case. Very close.

730
01:33:19,926 --> 01:33:21,634
Oh?

731
01:33:21,762 --> 01:33:28,014
Within four hours, or five at the most, we
expect to have Mr Larkin home and safe.

732
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:34,731
I strongly suggest, therefore,
that, in the best interests of your client,

733
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:37,730
you delay payment for those few hours.

734
01:33:37,863 --> 01:33:39,903
No way.

735
01:33:40,032 --> 01:33:43,401
This time I do exactly what they tell me.

736
01:33:44,412 --> 01:33:49,454
You pay that money now and
you'll get Larkin back in chunks.

737
01:33:50,877 --> 01:33:54,578
The lieutenant quotes
chapter and verse, Mr Fields.

738
01:33:54,715 --> 01:33:58,499
This is a gentleman who rejoices
in the name of Charlie-the-Handle,

739
01:33:58,636 --> 01:34:02,171
identified as a member
of the kidnap team.

740
01:34:02,307 --> 01:34:04,845
He will lead us to Mr Larkin.

741
01:34:04,976 --> 01:34:07,515
Kind of unusual, Melvin.

742
01:34:08,689 --> 01:34:12,438
Couple of  professional cops telling you
what's best for your client.

743
01:34:12,568 --> 01:34:16,151
Knock it off, Brannigan. If Larkin's friends in the States
find out I'm in bed with the Yard,

744
01:34:16,281 --> 01:34:19,531
they'll part my hair with a blowtorch.

745
01:34:21,411 --> 01:34:23,985
It's all there. You don't have to count it.

746
01:34:24,123 --> 01:34:29,628
Well, if you lose Larkin and that loot, they'll part
more than your hair with that blowtorch.

747
01:34:29,754 --> 01:34:32,791
Earthy but accurate,
I would have thought.

748
01:34:32,924 --> 01:34:37,800
If you'll accept my apologies, Mr. Fields, I really
must insist that you give us the time.

749
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:40,302
Something's coming in, sir.

750
01:34:40,433 --> 01:34:42,888
Put it on the speaker.

751
01:34:44,103 --> 01:34:47,971
Calling Mel Fields on 17.35.

752
01:34:48,108 --> 01:34:53,020
Now you contact us
on marine frequency 15.2.

753
01:34:53,155 --> 01:34:59,075
Repeat: 15.2. We will use
different frequencies to contact you

754
01:34:59,204 --> 01:35:04,080
and you will have only four seconds
to make the change.

755
01:35:04,209 --> 01:35:06,249
Calling Mel Fields.

756
01:35:07,296 --> 01:35:11,211
Calling Mel Fields on 17.35.
Are you there, Fields?

757
01:35:14,971 --> 01:35:18,590
- This is Mel Fields.
- Now, I'm going to give it to you just once,

758
01:35:18,725 --> 01:35:21,217
so get it good.

759
01:35:21,353 --> 01:35:24,271
This is how you make the drop.

760
01:35:24,398 --> 01:35:28,064
You leave the hotel in exactly ten minutes.

761
01:35:29,654 --> 01:35:33,355
Make sure you come alone.
Have you got that, Fields?

762
01:35:34,576 --> 01:35:36,616
Yes, I've got it.

763
01:35:37,830 --> 01:35:40,404
But I've run into a slight snag.

764
01:35:40,541 --> 01:35:44,539
- What's the problem?
- There's no problem.

765
01:35:44,671 --> 01:35:49,049
But the bank needs four or five hours
more to get the money together.

766
01:35:50,219 --> 01:35:53,505
- What do you think, Geef? Coppers?
- For his sake, I hope not.

767
01:35:53,639 --> 01:35:57,424
- Listen, Fields...
- Come on, Mel. Bring the money here!

768
01:35:57,560 --> 01:35:59,124
Bring it!

769
01:36:02,149 --> 01:36:06,479
All right, you've just bought yourself
four hours. And then you've had it.

770
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:13,656
Then you've had it.

771
01:36:18,292 --> 01:36:20,249
All right.

772
01:36:20,377 --> 01:36:23,213
You've got four hours to get Larkin back.

773
01:36:24,424 --> 01:36:29,964
But if you don't, I make the payment,
and I won't tell you where or when.

774
01:36:30,806 --> 01:36:33,475
- Fair enough.
- And, Commander Swann,

775
01:36:34,351 --> 01:36:38,480
I want your word that there'll be
no surveillance of any kind.

776
01:36:38,606 --> 01:36:41,441
You have my word, sir.

777
01:36:41,568 --> 01:36:45,696
Oh, and be sure to call room service
if you need anything.

778
01:36:48,701 --> 01:36:51,370
I will.

779
01:36:52,997 --> 01:36:55,120
Find anything?

780
01:36:58,169 --> 01:37:01,124
She's clean, sir, except for this.

781
01:37:02,925 --> 01:37:05,796
A long-range homing device.

782
01:37:08,222 --> 01:37:10,892
Can't trust anybody these days.

783
01:37:35,002 --> 01:37:37,458
Stay back. Not too close.

784
01:40:12,261 --> 01:40:14,135
It's OK. He's alone.

785
01:41:18,710 --> 01:41:22,411
Well, come on. Make the payoff
and let's get the hell out of here.

786
01:41:22,548 --> 01:41:24,587
Not yet, Ben.

787
01:41:26,719 --> 01:41:30,669
- What do you mean, not yet?
- Charlie. Geef.

788
01:41:31,641 --> 01:41:34,132
- You're early, Fields.
- Yeah.

789
01:41:35,103 --> 01:41:38,473
- Has he been a good boy?
- He never raised a finger.

790
01:41:38,607 --> 01:41:40,315
Ooh.

791
01:41:40,442 --> 01:41:43,397
Bad joke, Geef.

792
01:41:45,573 --> 01:41:47,613
Good job, Charlie.

793
01:41:52,790 --> 01:41:55,707
- Well, come on, get 'em off!
- Get back...

794
01:41:55,835 --> 01:41:59,286
on your big, fat ........rear.

795
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:06,845
Mel.

796
01:42:09,517 --> 01:42:11,556
What's going on?

797
01:42:14,188 --> 01:42:17,605
You know, I think it's about time.

798
01:42:17,734 --> 01:42:20,190
Yes.

799
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,990
But this is my party, Charlie.

800
01:42:25,743 --> 01:42:27,652
Ben...

801
01:42:30,290 --> 01:42:35,961
The first time we met, you told me
something I've never forgoten.

802
01:42:36,088 --> 01:42:38,579
It's my golden rule, you might say.

803
01:42:39,759 --> 01:42:43,342
Never trust anybody.

804
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:02,778
Mel, have you gone out of your...?

805
01:43:23,891 --> 01:43:26,727
We pulled it off, Ben. We did it!

806
01:43:28,313 --> 01:43:31,267
I'm sorry about your finger.
I'm really sorry.

807
01:43:31,399 --> 01:43:34,436
I bet you are.
For a million bucks, it was worth it.

808
01:43:34,570 --> 01:43:39,149
And don't forget that first payment
I've got stashed away.

809
01:43:39,283 --> 01:43:42,201
- How do I get this thing off?
- The key's over by the mirror.

810
01:43:42,328 --> 01:43:48,617
It's first class for you all the way
to South America, and on into the sunset.

811
01:43:50,838 --> 01:43:54,041
And this makes up for that bath I took
in that Jupiter stock.

812
01:43:54,175 --> 01:43:58,422
Yeah. Sorry about that.
And we got wall-to-wall alibis.

813
01:43:58,555 --> 01:44:03,051
Oh, Scotland Yard will swear that
I cooperated, I made the payments.

814
01:44:03,185 --> 01:44:07,847
And even that big clown Brannigan
backs up our story.

815
01:44:07,982 --> 01:44:10,438
As long as he's alive.

816
01:44:12,153 --> 01:44:17,741
You know, Mel, for a minute,
when you had that gun on me...

817
01:44:19,203 --> 01:44:22,703
I thought you were gonna get greedy.

818
01:44:22,832 --> 01:44:26,332
You know, for a minute,
Ben, I was tempted.

819
01:44:26,461 --> 01:44:32,298
But what the hell kind of world would it be
if you couldn't trust somebody, hm?

820
01:45:16,892 --> 01:45:18,932
We've been had.

821
01:45:23,066 --> 01:45:25,818
- Knock, knock.
- Brannigan!

822
01:45:26,736 --> 01:45:31,233
I wouldn't.
Unless you wanna sing soprano.

823
01:45:31,367 --> 01:45:35,151
Earthy, but I agree with my friend.

824
01:45:51,889 --> 01:45:54,641
They're all yours, Lieutenant.

825
01:45:59,606 --> 01:46:02,311
Don't worry about me, James.

826
01:46:02,443 --> 01:46:04,483
Bye-bye.

827
01:46:06,781 --> 01:46:09,403
And I mean bye-bye.

828
01:46:15,541 --> 01:46:18,542
That fella don't quit easy, does he?

829
01:46:18,669 --> 01:46:23,296
Well, do you think you can hang onto 'em until
I can get 'em a couple of airplane tickets?

830
01:46:23,425 --> 01:46:25,667
Oh, I think we could manage that, yes.

831
01:46:25,802 --> 01:46:28,757
I just hope you don't lose them
back in the Colonies.

832
01:46:28,889 --> 01:46:31,345
- Safe trip.
- Thank you.

833
01:46:50,204 --> 01:46:52,874
How about a lift, Yank?

834
01:47:12,980 --> 01:47:15,305
Gorman. Jim!

835
01:47:27,037 --> 01:47:29,445
- Jim! Jim?
- I'm all right.

836
01:47:32,627 --> 01:47:34,287
Hold it here.

837
01:47:39,343 --> 01:47:40,967
Now!

838
01:47:42,137 --> 01:47:45,092
Get behind that car!

839
01:50:03,712 --> 01:50:05,870
Well...

840
01:50:06,006 --> 01:50:08,462
I'm gonna miss this old town.

841
01:50:08,592 --> 01:50:11,048
It's gonna miss you.

842
01:50:12,096 --> 01:50:15,715
I'm not sure if I agree with what
my old dad said about you Yanks.

843
01:50:15,850 --> 01:50:19,017
You mean that part about being overpaid?

844
01:50:19,146 --> 01:50:21,637
No. Over here.

845
01:50:22,816 --> 01:50:26,649
- Jenny, it's been great.
- It has.

846
01:50:26,779 --> 01:50:28,819
So long.

847
