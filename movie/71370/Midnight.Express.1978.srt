0
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:09,086
Excuse me.

1
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:20,430
- Nervous?
- No.

2
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:25,234
- I hate flying.
- Is something I ate.

3
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:31,490
Maybe you're just excited
about getting home.

4
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:36,786
- I've got to go to the john again.
- I'll wait.

5
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,202
- No, I'll catch up to you. Okay?
- Okay.

6
00:04:45,574 --> 00:04:48,576
Passport.

7
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:04,047
Basket.

8
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,913
Is a frisbee.

9
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:38,290
You throw it and catch it.
Is a game.

10
00:05:38,465 --> 00:05:42,166
A game...

11
00:06:31,896 --> 00:06:37,022
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, great. Want a piece of gum?

12
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:41,235
Thank you.

13
00:06:41,408 --> 00:06:45,405
See this?
Janis Joplin died yesterday.

14
00:06:45,578 --> 00:06:48,663
Overdose.
There never was anyone like Janis.

15
00:06:48,832 --> 00:06:53,708
- There never was anyone like you.
- Knock it off.

16
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,627
- You never take anything seriously.
- Nothing.

17
00:07:19,782 --> 00:07:23,115
- Whas he saying?
- I don't know.

18
00:07:23,285 --> 00:07:28,623
They always have everything
ass backwards in Turkey.

19
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:35,665
- Billy, whas the matter?
- Passport. Susan, get on the plane.

20
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:43,338
- Whas wrong, are you sick?
- Get on the plane. Go.

21
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:13,543
I'm looking for my passport.

22
00:08:17,134 --> 00:08:21,631
Harry, you'd better
get rid of those grenades.

23
00:09:22,246 --> 00:09:25,200
Get down.

24
00:10:33,238 --> 00:10:36,323
- Name?
- William Hayes.

25
00:10:36,492 --> 00:10:40,325
- William...
- Hayes.

26
00:10:40,496 --> 00:10:44,624
Hayes.

27
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:48,210
- American?
- Thas right.

28
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:52,628
Yes, American. United States.

29
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:55,472
American.

30
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:13,112
- Name?
- Jesus... William Hayes.

31
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:19,996
- Name?
- Hayes. H-A-Y-E-S.

32
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:06,100
Howdy, Billy.
How are you doing? Okay?

33
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:14,942
I think these gentlemen
have finished for the time being.

34
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,035
If you'd like
to put your clothes on.

35
00:13:40,522 --> 00:13:44,984
The officer wants to know
if you're afraid.

36
00:13:45,153 --> 00:13:48,403
No, I'm not afraid.

37
00:14:02,672 --> 00:14:06,586
The officer said
there's nothing to be afraid of.

38
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:10,674
Co-operate,
and you'll be on the plane home.

39
00:14:20,148 --> 00:14:25,309
- Where did you get the hashish?
- From a cab driver.

40
00:14:25,488 --> 00:14:28,489
In the playing shop at the bazaar.

41
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:47,424
- Would you recognise him again?
- I think so.

42
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:57,723
You decided to fly at a bad time.

43
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:03,521
Guerrillas all over the place,
blowing up planes...

44
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:08,488
Four planes in four days.
Don't you read the newspapers?

45
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:12,822
There's been a shit storm
over the flow of heroin from Turkey.

46
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:16,864
- I didn't have heroin.
- A drug is a drug.

47
00:15:17,043 --> 00:15:21,670
It was my first time.
It was only two kilos.

48
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,374
It doesn't matter
if it was 2 or 200 kilos.

49
00:15:25,552 --> 00:15:29,846
Catching you shows the world
Turkey is fighting the drug trade.

50
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:35,602
- Are you with the Consulate?
- Something like that. Cigarette?

51
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,356
- What did you pay this cab driver?
- $200. My last 200.

52
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:45,940
- How much did you figure to make?
- I'd only sell it to my friends.

53
00:15:46,115 --> 00:15:50,279
- I'm not a pusher. Honest.
- It beats working.

54
00:15:50,454 --> 00:15:55,794
- Have you got a family?
- Mother, father, brother, sister.

55
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,041
- Long Island.
- Ill be tough on them.

56
00:16:00,215 --> 00:16:04,545
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah, she was on the plane.

57
00:16:06,971 --> 00:16:13,889
- She didn't know anything about it.
- Lucky girl.

58
00:16:14,063 --> 00:16:18,773
- She used to say I was lucky.
- Les hope so, Billy.

59
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:33,047
You seem like a nice enough kid.

60
00:20:33,216 --> 00:20:38,293
But you try it,
and I'll blow your brains out.

61
00:21:07,335 --> 00:21:14,169
Mom and Dad, this is the hardest
letter I've ever had to write.

62
00:21:14,343 --> 00:21:20,845
I hoped to get out of this quickly,
so you'd never know about it.

63
00:21:21,017 --> 00:21:27,386
But that just isn't possible now.
I don't know whas going to happen.

64
00:21:27,565 --> 00:21:31,943
What can I say to you?
Will "I'm sorry" make a difference?

65
00:21:32,112 --> 00:21:37,107
Will it ease the pain,
the shame you must be feeling?

66
00:21:37,284 --> 00:21:40,699
Forgive me, please.

67
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,220
Could I have a blanket?

68
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:02,890
Is cold.
Could I have a blanket?

69
00:22:03,061 --> 00:22:09,314
- A blanket!
- Too late. Tomorrow.

70
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:16,734
He'll be here tomorrow, I think.
Goodnight.

71
00:22:51,696 --> 00:22:55,944
- Can you speak English?
- Your cell is open.

72
00:22:56,118 --> 00:23:00,495
Blankets, three cells down.
You get me one.

73
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:21,203
I needed a blanket.

74
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:27,214
William Hayes.

75
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:45,692
I needed a blanket, I was cold!

76
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:03,558
Jesus...

77
00:26:03,736 --> 00:26:06,986
Come on, you must stand.

78
00:26:08,031 --> 00:26:11,946
You'd better walk around,
or your feet will swell up.

79
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:19,287
- You've got to be crazy.
- We all are. Smoke some of this.

80
00:26:20,171 --> 00:26:26,755
You've been out for days,
talking all kinds of shit.

81
00:26:26,928 --> 00:26:30,463
- How does it feel?
- About as good as it looks.

82
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:38,055
Gecmis olsun. Is Turkish.
It means, "May it pass quickly."

83
00:26:39,566 --> 00:26:43,695
- It looks like a cheap hotel.
- The room service is lousy.

84
00:26:43,863 --> 00:26:48,156
I'm Jimmy Booth.
This is Erich... something Swedish.

85
00:26:48,325 --> 00:26:51,410
- Just Erich.
- He cleaned you up.

86
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:56,158
Thanks. I'm Billy Hayes...
at least I used to be.

87
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:38,789
- Why peacocks?
- They use them instead of dogs.

88
00:27:38,963 --> 00:27:45,630
They scream like mad if they're
disturbed and they don't get rabies.

89
00:27:46,721 --> 00:27:52,013
- Who are the kids?
- Little fuckers...

90
00:27:52,186 --> 00:27:56,765
Thieves, rapists, murderers...
You name it, they do it.

91
00:27:56,941 --> 00:28:01,021
Don't trust any of them.
They tell Rifki everything.

92
00:28:01,195 --> 00:28:04,481
He's the squeal around here.
He sells tea, -

93
00:28:04,657 --> 00:28:08,441
- hash, blankets,
anything for a buck.

94
00:28:09,995 --> 00:28:13,697
- What are you in for, hash?
- Yeah.

95
00:28:15,251 --> 00:28:18,170
- Where?
- At the airport.

96
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:24,508
Thas heavy.
This ain't the good old USA.

97
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:28,463
In Turkey, is a fucking accident
if you're innocent.

98
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:33,305
- Nobody here is innocent.
- Don't pay too much attention.

99
00:28:33,481 --> 00:28:39,104
Anything is possible in Turkey.
They may not hit you for smuggling.

100
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:43,323
If they make it possession,
you might even get bail.

101
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:48,864
If you make bail, you're free.
Sneak across the border to Greece.

102
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:55,077
Sure, keep dreaming.
See where it gets you. Like Max.

103
00:28:55,253 --> 00:28:59,584
Is going to be a while
before you taste a hamburger again.

104
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:04,254
- You broke the law.
- The law is sometimes wrong.

105
00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:07,347
The law is never wrong!

106
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,136
The fucking law is.

107
00:29:19,821 --> 00:29:23,820
- People get on his nerves.
- Whas he in for?

108
00:29:23,993 --> 00:29:26,911
Stealing from a mosque.

109
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,365
- What did he steal?
- Two candlesticks.

110
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:33,827
- Thas all?
- Jimmy has more balls than brains.

111
00:29:34,003 --> 00:29:38,999
He was in for a year and a half
before he even told his parents.

112
00:29:39,176 --> 00:29:44,596
- What about you?
- Hashish, like most foreigners.

113
00:29:44,764 --> 00:29:49,474
- What did they give you?
- 12 years. I had 100 grams.

114
00:29:49,645 --> 00:29:55,897
You've got to get a good lawyer.
Talk to the Englishman. Max.

115
00:29:56,068 --> 00:29:59,936
He's been in the longest.
Seven years.

116
00:30:17,383 --> 00:30:21,677
Gastro. Stomach medicine.

117
00:30:23,473 --> 00:30:28,551
Is got codeine in it.
Is the best I can do around here.

118
00:30:28,729 --> 00:30:31,101
Max...

119
00:30:31,273 --> 00:30:35,485
- Lawyers?
- Oh, yeah.

120
00:30:36,653 --> 00:30:40,734
There's no straight lawyers
in Turkey.

121
00:30:40,908 --> 00:30:44,527
They're all bent.

122
00:30:44,704 --> 00:30:49,995
Bent as hairpins.
Occupational necessity.

123
00:30:50,168 --> 00:30:54,961
They have special classes
in corruption at night school.

124
00:30:56,342 --> 00:31:00,174
If you're suspected of honesty,
you're disbarred.

125
00:31:05,308 --> 00:31:09,853
I knew a lawyer fellow once.

126
00:31:10,023 --> 00:31:14,686
He got that Frenchman off.
La Roche.

127
00:31:18,031 --> 00:31:21,151
A big smuggler.

128
00:31:21,326 --> 00:31:24,660
200 kilos.

129
00:31:26,082 --> 00:31:30,791
He put enough bread
in enough pockets. Got bail.

130
00:31:30,962 --> 00:31:34,580
Vanished.

131
00:31:34,758 --> 00:31:39,634
- His name?
- Who?

132
00:31:39,805 --> 00:31:45,226
- The lawyer.
- Lawyer?

133
00:31:45,393 --> 00:31:50,103
Who got the Frenchman off.

134
00:31:51,984 --> 00:31:57,821
Yesil is his name.

135
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:03,699
I don't know anything else
about him.

136
00:32:03,872 --> 00:32:07,289
Yesil.

137
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:14,164
The best thing to do
is get your ass out of here.

138
00:32:14,341 --> 00:32:18,754
- Yeah, but how?
- Catch the midnight express.

139
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:22,097
Whas that?

140
00:32:24,727 --> 00:32:33,817
Is not a train.
Is a prison word for... escape.

141
00:32:38,492 --> 00:32:41,577
It doesn't stop around here.

142
00:33:28,588 --> 00:33:31,506
Dad, I'm sorry.

143
00:33:31,675 --> 00:33:34,878
Forget it.

144
00:33:35,053 --> 00:33:41,852
I'll punch you in the nose later.
We've got to get you out of here.

145
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,728
This is a suit I brought for you.

146
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:51,519
Smarten you up a little.

147
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:58,785
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

148
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:02,323
How's Mom?

149
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:06,498
Well, she's bad.

150
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:11,498
She couldn't make the trip.
You know Mom. Her boy...

151
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:18,046
Susan told us
before we got your letter.

152
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:21,428
She's saving to come back here...

153
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:27,273
Don't let her come.
How's Rob? How's Peg?

154
00:34:27,443 --> 00:34:30,728
They're the same. You know.

155
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:36,113
We told the neighbours
you were in hospital in Europe.

156
00:34:36,286 --> 00:34:42,788
This is Stanley Daniels.
He's the American Consul here.

157
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:50,754
Billy, we're going to do everything
in our power to get you out of here.

158
00:34:50,926 --> 00:34:57,843
Thas Necdit Yesil,
the lawyer you asked for.

159
00:34:58,017 --> 00:35:02,182
I know exactly what you feel,
but you must not worry.

160
00:35:02,356 --> 00:35:06,567
We'll get the right court
and the right judge.

161
00:35:06,735 --> 00:35:10,187
I'll arrange everything, just right.

162
00:35:11,615 --> 00:35:18,032
I understand that if you get bail,
is easy to get across the border.

163
00:35:18,205 --> 00:35:24,575
Thas what we're shooting for.
I've spoken to the State Department.

164
00:35:24,753 --> 00:35:30,045
Right now, relations with the Turks
aren't too good. Nixon upset them.

165
00:35:30,218 --> 00:35:36,507
- Our best bet is right here.
- Dad, I'll pay you back for this.

166
00:35:36,684 --> 00:35:41,062
Money doesn't matter, Billy.
Not at this stage.

167
00:35:46,986 --> 00:35:53,026
- Where did you get that limp?
- I twisted my ankle.

168
00:35:53,202 --> 00:35:58,195
- Where are you staying?
- The Hilton.

169
00:35:58,374 --> 00:36:03,879
- How do you like Istanbul?
- Interesting place.

170
00:36:04,046 --> 00:36:09,504
The food is lousy. The crap
they sell in the restaurants...

171
00:36:09,678 --> 00:36:14,885
I had to run to the toilet.
You should have seen the toilet.

172
00:36:15,058 --> 00:36:22,437
I'll eat at the Hilton every night.
Steak, French fries and ketchup.

173
00:36:29,823 --> 00:36:32,990
Billy...

174
00:36:33,161 --> 00:36:39,496
- Why did you do it?
- Money.

175
00:36:40,752 --> 00:36:44,501
I know you kids smoke that stuff
and we drink booze, -

176
00:36:44,673 --> 00:36:48,968
- but taking it across the border,
thas stupid.

177
00:36:49,137 --> 00:36:51,591
I know.

178
00:36:51,764 --> 00:36:57,601
Dad... get me out of here.

179
00:36:57,771 --> 00:37:02,599
I promise you. Just sit tight.

180
00:37:02,777 --> 00:37:07,687
Let me work with Mr. Daniels
and Mr. Yesil here.

181
00:37:07,865 --> 00:37:11,115
We'll get you out, okay?

182
00:37:11,285 --> 00:37:15,235
Hey, Billy... Okay?

183
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,456
Okay.

184
00:39:01,236 --> 00:39:05,733
- What did that prosecutor say?
- Is not important.

185
00:39:05,908 --> 00:39:11,247
We made our case. You spoke well.
The judge liked you.

186
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:34,051
Mr. Hayes, the judge is coming back.

187
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:20,446
- Four years, two months.
- Four years?

188
00:40:20,613 --> 00:40:22,689
We'll appeal.

189
00:40:22,865 --> 00:40:28,951
Ill be reduced for good behaviour.
It is only for possession.

190
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:33,998
The prosecutor wanted
a life sentence for smuggling.

191
00:40:34,169 --> 00:40:39,709
To be honest, Mr. Hayes,
it is a great victory.

192
00:40:50,062 --> 00:40:56,479
With good time,
it works out to about three years.

193
00:40:56,652 --> 00:40:59,819
And then there's the appeal.

194
00:40:59,989 --> 00:41:08,412
Daniels and Yesil
are all working for you.

195
00:41:08,581 --> 00:41:12,365
We're trying to get you transferred.

196
00:41:12,543 --> 00:41:18,416
Daniels thinks there might be
a political amnesty any month now.

197
00:41:22,054 --> 00:41:25,969
All right, Billy...

198
00:41:26,142 --> 00:41:31,812
I know it sounds tough,
but we are going to get you out.

199
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:37,320
I promise you.
Don't do anything stupid.

200
00:41:37,486 --> 00:41:41,188
They could play with your sentence.

201
00:41:42,993 --> 00:41:46,197
All right, now...

202
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:55,168
I'm putting $500 in the bank.
Anything you need, you write.

203
00:41:55,340 --> 00:42:00,547
There's food here,
candy, writing paper, -

204
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:08,052
- books, cigarettes, soap,
toothbrush...

205
00:42:13,442 --> 00:42:16,562
I've sold insurance for 30 years.

206
00:42:16,737 --> 00:42:20,356
Now I've got to see my own son...

207
00:42:20,533 --> 00:42:25,076
Jesus!

208
00:42:28,917 --> 00:42:36,000
If I could be where you are...
I'd be there.

209
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,379
I love you, Dad.

210
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:16,627
You take good care of my boy,
or I'll have your fucking head!

211
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:55,779
Dear Susan,
1970 has now passed into 1971.

212
00:44:55,949 --> 00:44:59,948
You can drift in here
and never know you're gone.

213
00:45:00,122 --> 00:45:06,373
You can fade so far out, you
don't know where you are anymore.

214
00:45:06,544 --> 00:45:14,969
I find loneliness is a physical pain
that hurts all over.

215
00:45:46,378 --> 00:45:49,664
To the Turks
everything is "soyle boyle".

216
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:53,792
It means "like this, like that."
You never know what will happen.

217
00:45:55,556 --> 00:45:59,885
All foreigners are "ayip."
They're considered dirty.

218
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:05,221
So is homosexuality, but they
do it every chance they get.

219
00:46:05,399 --> 00:46:10,027
There are about 1,000 things
that are "ayip".

220
00:46:10,197 --> 00:46:15,439
You can stab or shoot somebody
below the waist but not above.

221
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:21,911
Stabbing somebody in the ass
is considered Turkish revenge.

222
00:46:24,379 --> 00:46:29,502
I know it must sound crazy to you,
but this place is crazy.

223
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:39,556
One day,
one of the new kids was raped.

224
00:46:39,727 --> 00:46:44,140
So they picked out
four of the worst kids.

225
00:48:14,996 --> 00:48:19,659
Then there's Rifki. The more
I know of him, the more I hate him.

226
00:48:19,835 --> 00:48:23,703
$10 for this shit? You pig.

227
00:48:23,881 --> 00:48:27,499
There are no pigs in Turkey.

228
00:48:27,677 --> 00:48:33,797
- This shit is shit.
- No, is good. Good shit.

229
00:48:33,975 --> 00:48:37,973
- You big shit.
- Yeah, me big shit.

230
00:48:57,208 --> 00:49:00,329
You asshole.

231
00:49:04,717 --> 00:49:09,379
What is it with you?
Just what the hell is it, man?

232
00:49:12,433 --> 00:49:16,301
You don't fuck with me,
I don't fuck with you.

233
00:49:16,479 --> 00:49:20,477
You fuck with me all the time.
You make crummy tea.

234
00:49:20,649 --> 00:49:27,698
- You rip us off on the hash.
- I make special tea for you.

235
00:49:27,867 --> 00:49:32,778
We have to live like brothers.
We have to be in here together.

236
00:49:32,956 --> 00:49:36,786
For all the money you've got,
you've got nothing.

237
00:49:36,959 --> 00:49:41,835
- You are American, you don't know.
- Know what?

238
00:49:42,006 --> 00:49:44,165
Dog eat dog.

239
00:49:44,342 --> 00:49:48,589
You fuck other man before he
fucks you. And you must fuck last.

240
00:49:57,023 --> 00:50:00,973
Come on down.

241
00:50:06,742 --> 00:50:13,575
Egbert...
Sodding cat.

242
00:52:43,826 --> 00:52:46,115
William!

243
00:52:46,287 --> 00:52:50,700
Are you all right?

244
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:55,537
The new American Ambassador
is following your case.

245
00:52:55,713 --> 00:53:00,542
He says there is progress.
You want a cigarette?

246
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,424
But there is another route...

247
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:09,726
...that is quite possible.

248
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:13,514
For a proper amount of money,
it is possible -

249
00:53:13,692 --> 00:53:18,438
- to convince the ten officials
to lose track of your papers -

250
00:53:18,614 --> 00:53:23,359
- before the High Court in Ankara
confirms your sentence.

251
00:53:23,535 --> 00:53:31,746
And you could be in Greece by
the time they discover the mistake.

252
00:53:34,339 --> 00:53:41,967
But I have to act before the
official sentence is handed down.

253
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:50,556
And for that
I must pay certain officials.

254
00:54:02,868 --> 00:54:05,194
Whas that?

255
00:54:11,713 --> 00:54:16,624
The blueprints to the prison, man.

256
00:54:16,801 --> 00:54:22,922
There was this German architect
in the hospital.

257
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:25,888
He let me copy them.

258
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:30,106
Is too bad
you didn't have a Xerox machine.

259
00:54:31,525 --> 00:54:34,526
There are two ways out of here.

260
00:54:34,695 --> 00:54:39,773
One is over the roof,
but thas kind of risky.

261
00:54:39,951 --> 00:54:45,787
The other way, I'll need your help,
and that is under.

262
00:54:48,544 --> 00:54:50,832
A tunnel?

263
00:54:51,004 --> 00:54:56,877
- Are you serious?
- This is not Stalag 17.

264
00:54:57,052 --> 00:55:02,213
Thas where you're wrong.
The tunnel is already built.

265
00:55:02,391 --> 00:55:06,472
There's a basement
where they used to keep weapons.

266
00:55:06,646 --> 00:55:13,610
Beneath that are the catacombs the
Christians built to bury their dead.

267
00:55:13,779 --> 00:55:18,406
We're sitting
right on top of it... here.

268
00:55:19,453 --> 00:55:25,206
The kraut says that there's
a bunch of hollow shafts.

269
00:55:25,374 --> 00:55:29,752
They're like dumbwaiters,
all along these walls.

270
00:55:29,921 --> 00:55:33,919
One of them
is right next to our shower.

271
00:55:34,093 --> 00:55:37,792
If we get in there,
we can get down into the catacombs.

272
00:55:37,971 --> 00:55:41,921
With three of us working,
it shouldn't take too long.

273
00:55:42,101 --> 00:55:47,096
I swear I heard a couple of dead
Christians singing down there.

274
00:55:47,273 --> 00:55:54,486
- You stop shitting me, man. Okay?
- How do we get into the shaft?

275
00:55:54,656 --> 00:55:58,950
We knock three times and
say we're a friend of the deceased.

276
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:04,955
I'm getting this together and
I don't need no gastro-head along.

277
00:56:05,125 --> 00:56:08,245
You understand me?

278
00:56:15,595 --> 00:56:20,092
- We go through the wall.
- We go through the wall?

279
00:56:21,893 --> 00:56:24,811
Go through the wall.

280
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:51,292
There's no reinforced steel
in those shower walls.

281
00:56:51,466 --> 00:56:57,173
Is real soft
from underground seepage.

282
00:56:57,348 --> 00:57:00,681
You can almost push it over.

283
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:04,138
All we have to do...

284
00:57:04,314 --> 00:57:09,474
We only have to use your screwdriver
to scrape the mortar out.

285
00:57:09,652 --> 00:57:13,567
We pull out three stones
and squeeze through...

286
00:57:22,917 --> 00:57:27,414
Squeeze through,
and get our ass down the shaft.

287
00:57:27,589 --> 00:57:32,299
- Is a two-night operation.
- What do we do in the catacombs?

288
00:57:32,469 --> 00:57:35,470
What do you want, a door?

289
00:57:35,638 --> 00:57:39,340
There's miles of them down there.

290
00:57:39,518 --> 00:57:44,513
- You must be fucking crazy.
- They've got to come up someplace.

291
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:51,192
You won't find any catacombs,
you'll just finish up in section 13.

292
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:57,863
Billy... the tunnel or the roof?

293
00:57:58,038 --> 00:58:01,657
Forget the wall.
Rifki's always there.

294
00:58:01,834 --> 00:58:07,753
- The roof is guarded.
- Help me get into the shaft.

295
00:58:07,924 --> 00:58:12,337
If we get caught,
I'll get the shaft.

296
00:58:12,512 --> 00:58:17,138
I'll be back up to
three years again, maybe more.

297
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:23,020
Fuck it, then.
You choose your own death.

298
00:58:23,191 --> 00:58:28,648
I'll do this thing on my own.
I'm taking the roof out of here.

299
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:49,042
No! I can't take it!

300
00:59:29,136 --> 00:59:32,837
Dear Susan,
Jimmy was caught and beaten badly.

301
00:59:33,015 --> 00:59:36,847
He got a severe hernia
and lost a testicle.

302
00:59:37,019 --> 00:59:40,720
He's been in the sanatorium
for months.

303
00:59:40,898 --> 00:59:45,062
In comparison,
my problems seem small.

304
00:59:45,236 --> 00:59:49,649
But 2 1/2 years have gone by.

305
00:59:49,824 --> 00:59:54,570
The Turks
are slowly draining my life away.

306
01:00:03,755 --> 01:00:11,337
- Why do you keep your hair short?
- To remind me that I hate it here.

307
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:07,824
Prison, monastery, cloister, cave.

308
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:34,514
Prison...

309
01:03:33,523 --> 01:03:39,776
- Okay.
- I've thought of another way.

310
01:03:39,947 --> 01:03:44,075
- Another way what?
- Out of here.

311
01:03:44,243 --> 01:03:49,949
When I was in the sanatorium,
there was only one guard on duty.

312
01:03:50,124 --> 01:03:54,703
- I could have got out of there.
- Why didn't you?

313
01:03:54,879 --> 01:04:00,170
As soon as I could walk,
they threw me back in here.

314
01:04:00,343 --> 01:04:04,803
- Lucky you.
- I tell you, Billy...

315
01:04:04,972 --> 01:04:10,098
Another ward in the sanatorium
had no guard on it at all.

316
01:04:10,270 --> 01:04:13,391
- Who was in it?
- Three guys.

317
01:04:13,566 --> 01:04:18,274
- What was wrong with them?
- I don't know.

318
01:04:19,404 --> 01:04:24,281
- I think they were dead.
- It figures.

319
01:04:31,001 --> 01:04:36,755
I've got to go. Is Daniels!
Turkish justice has done it again.

320
01:04:36,924 --> 01:04:43,010
They're going to let me off.
Jimmy, I'm going home!

321
01:04:43,181 --> 01:04:48,139
God! "I've got to go."

322
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:08,158
Whas wrong?

323
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:11,701
Sit down, Billy.

324
01:05:11,878 --> 01:05:17,003
I'm afraid
I have some bad news for you.

325
01:05:18,009 --> 01:05:22,304
- Is it Dad? Mom?
- No.

326
01:05:22,472 --> 01:05:28,842
- You're going to have a new court.
- What do you mean?

327
01:05:29,021 --> 01:05:34,064
The prosecutor objected
to your sentence for possession.

328
01:05:34,236 --> 01:05:38,779
He wanted a smuggling conviction.
The Ankara court reviewed it.

329
01:05:38,949 --> 01:05:45,320
It seems everyone wanted
an example made. A scapegoat.

330
01:05:48,001 --> 01:05:54,335
We've been notified
that they rejected the sentence.

331
01:05:55,633 --> 01:05:58,801
There were 35 judges in the court.

332
01:05:58,971 --> 01:06:02,839
28 voted for... a life sentence.

333
01:06:05,226 --> 01:06:10,103
The lower court in Istanbul
had to go along with the decision.

334
01:06:10,274 --> 01:06:15,233
The judge likes you.
He notified your dad.

335
01:06:15,405 --> 01:06:18,737
What do you mean, life?

336
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:23,155
- Life for what?
- Billy!

337
01:06:23,329 --> 01:06:28,704
I have 53 days left!

338
01:06:46,396 --> 01:06:50,097
So now is time for me to speak.

339
01:06:50,275 --> 01:06:54,226
What is there for me to say?

340
01:06:54,405 --> 01:06:59,991
When I finish,
you'll sentence me for my crime.

341
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:03,328
So let me ask you now:

342
01:07:03,498 --> 01:07:06,369
What is a crime?

343
01:07:06,543 --> 01:07:09,330
What is a punishment?

344
01:07:09,504 --> 01:07:15,756
It seems to vary from time to time
and place to place.

345
01:07:15,927 --> 01:07:22,097
Whas legal today
is suddenly illegal tomorrow.

346
01:07:22,268 --> 01:07:28,805
Whas illegal is suddenly legal
because everybody's doing it.

347
01:07:28,983 --> 01:07:32,981
You can't put everybody in jail.

348
01:07:33,822 --> 01:07:37,358
I'm not saying
this is right or wrong.

349
01:07:37,535 --> 01:07:42,446
I'm just saying
thas the way it is.

350
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:49,829
I've spent 3 1/2 years of my life
in your prison.

351
01:07:50,007 --> 01:07:54,715
I think I've paid for my error.

352
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:03,220
If is your decision today
to sentence me to more years...

353
01:08:18,119 --> 01:08:23,660
My lawyer... thas a good one.
He says, "Be cool, Billy."

354
01:08:23,834 --> 01:08:30,252
"Be good. I'll get you a pardon,
an amnesty, an appeal."

355
01:08:30,966 --> 01:08:36,341
This has been going on now
for 3 1/2 years.

356
01:08:36,514 --> 01:08:41,972
I've been playing it cool.
I've been good.

357
01:08:43,273 --> 01:08:51,184
Now I'm damn tired of being good.
You said I had 53 days left.

358
01:08:51,364 --> 01:08:58,611
You hung 53 days in my face,
and then you took them away.

359
01:08:58,788 --> 01:09:01,493
And you!

360
01:09:01,666 --> 01:09:05,996
I wish you could be standing
where I'm standing right now.

361
01:09:06,171 --> 01:09:10,217
Then you would know something
that you don't know.

362
01:09:10,384 --> 01:09:13,301
Mercy!

363
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:21,052
You would know that a just society
is based on the concept of mercy.

364
01:09:21,229 --> 01:09:24,479
Its sense of fair play and justice.

365
01:09:26,859 --> 01:09:30,904
But I guess thas like asking
a bear to shit in a toilet.

366
01:09:42,085 --> 01:09:47,292
For a nation of pigs,
it sure is funny you don't eat them.

367
01:09:56,058 --> 01:10:01,645
Jesus Christ forgave the bastards,
but I can't.

368
01:10:04,776 --> 01:10:09,484
I hate.

369
01:10:09,655 --> 01:10:12,361
I hate you.

370
01:10:12,533 --> 01:10:17,611
I hate your nation
and I hate your people.

371
01:10:17,789 --> 01:10:23,709
I fuck your sons and daughters
because they're pigs.

372
01:10:23,879 --> 01:10:26,501
You're a pig.

373
01:10:31,887 --> 01:10:35,552
You're all pigs.

374
01:10:57,208 --> 01:11:02,996
My hands are tied by Ankara.

375
01:11:08,677 --> 01:11:13,672
I must sentence you, William Hayes,
to be imprisoned -

376
01:11:13,849 --> 01:11:16,969
- for a term no less than 30 years.

377
01:11:19,313 --> 01:11:22,932
May it pass quickly.

378
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:51,299
Got the old Istanbul blues

379
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:54,973
Istanbul blues

380
01:11:55,144 --> 01:12:00,684
they give me 30 years

381
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:04,939
ain't got nothing left to lose...

382
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:10,071
We are going to get you out.
I promise you.

383
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:15,915
Don't do anything stupid.
They could play with your sentence.

384
01:12:21,297 --> 01:12:25,758
I was busted at the border...

385
01:12:25,927 --> 01:12:31,088
The best thing to do
is get your ass out of here.

386
01:12:31,266 --> 01:12:34,966
The best way you can.

387
01:13:13,143 --> 01:13:17,605
Hey, I think I found it.
Come here.

388
01:13:18,901 --> 01:13:23,148
Listen to that.
Do you hear anything?

389
01:13:26,116 --> 01:13:30,328
I told you, you suckers.
You didn't believe me.

390
01:13:30,495 --> 01:13:34,031
Keep it down.

391
01:13:36,628 --> 01:13:40,542
Look how soft this is.
Ill be easy.

392
01:13:40,715 --> 01:13:48,546
Go and get Rifki's poker,
but don't wake him up.

393
01:14:06,034 --> 01:14:11,242
Is really soft. Is coming.

394
01:14:15,294 --> 01:14:19,162
- Jimmy, is coming.
- Here, use this.

395
01:14:22,343 --> 01:14:27,469
Is coming real easy.
Is coming right out.

396
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:32,931
Is easier than I thought.
Is a piece of cake.

397
01:14:43,324 --> 01:14:46,526
Is coming.

398
01:14:46,701 --> 01:14:49,408
Like butter.

399
01:14:50,499 --> 01:14:55,660
Hey, Max. Rifki.

400
01:15:11,647 --> 01:15:15,395
- Keep checking for Rifki.
- Is okay.

401
01:15:30,499 --> 01:15:35,791
- Watch it.
- I thought you wanted out of here.

402
01:15:38,883 --> 01:15:43,676
- They're loose.
- Les try.

403
01:15:43,847 --> 01:15:47,548
- Watch your hernia.
- Fuck that.

404
01:15:53,066 --> 01:15:57,111
- Okay? You got it?
- Yeah.

405
01:16:03,994 --> 01:16:09,237
Thas it. Is the shaft.

406
01:16:16,132 --> 01:16:18,754
Is coming.

407
01:16:25,725 --> 01:16:29,675
Is okay.

408
01:16:36,069 --> 01:16:41,147
- Les go, Billy.
- Is too late. We're not prepared.

409
01:16:41,325 --> 01:16:44,991
We'll go tomorrow.
Is too late.

410
01:16:45,163 --> 01:16:48,365
Les put them back. Help me.

411
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:17,978
Any fuck-ups
and we should be back by dawn.

412
01:17:18,156 --> 01:17:22,106
You got everything?

413
01:17:22,287 --> 01:17:27,197
Maps, railroad, bus timetables.

414
01:17:27,374 --> 01:17:31,075
Okay, les do it.

415
01:18:33,695 --> 01:18:37,111
- Can you see?
- No.

416
01:18:52,716 --> 01:18:57,296
Come on, Max,
get your ass down here.

417
01:18:58,682 --> 01:19:02,680
This way to Istanbul, baby.

418
01:19:07,274 --> 01:19:11,568
Watch it.
Mind how you go there.

419
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:20,234
Are you all right?
Come down this pole and cross over.

420
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:25,039
Terrific.

421
01:19:28,671 --> 01:19:33,001
- All right, is a tunnel.
- Les go.

422
01:19:56,451 --> 01:19:59,488
Come on, Max.

423
01:20:09,173 --> 01:20:12,839
Fuck! What is that? Shit!

424
01:20:28,819 --> 01:20:35,652
Shit! Is a dead end.
The Turks must have blocked it up.

425
01:20:35,826 --> 01:20:39,077
Shit!

426
01:20:41,708 --> 01:20:44,116
Billy!

427
01:20:46,923 --> 01:20:51,169
- What the fuck are we going to do?
- What time is it?

428
01:20:51,343 --> 01:20:54,878
4:30.

429
01:20:57,141 --> 01:21:03,560
- Go back.
- You must be fucking joking.

430
01:21:03,732 --> 01:21:09,023
We go back, seal it up,
and come back tomorrow.

431
01:21:09,196 --> 01:21:13,360
Every night, until we get out.

432
01:21:13,534 --> 01:21:17,532
There's got to be a way out.

433
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:36,130
Billy, they found it. Rifki.

434
01:22:16,727 --> 01:22:19,931
No do, no do.

435
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:47,459
I'm going to kick your brains
all over your fucking kitchen.

436
01:22:47,635 --> 01:22:51,086
Fine! Good. Man to man.

437
01:22:51,263 --> 01:22:58,263
When we're finished, I'll bring
Hamidou and he'll kick your ass.

438
01:23:00,315 --> 01:23:03,351
Les go, Max. Come on.

439
01:23:12,662 --> 01:23:17,205
- I know what I'm going to do.
- What?

440
01:23:17,375 --> 01:23:21,539
- I'm going to cut his throat.
- Whose?

441
01:23:21,713 --> 01:23:24,750
Rifki.

442
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:34,434
What have I got to lose?
Anyway, I'd really enjoy it.

443
01:23:37,647 --> 01:23:43,816
Why don't you sit down?
You're in no shape to kill anybody.

444
01:23:43,987 --> 01:23:49,444
- I want to cut his fucking throat.
- Is already been cut.

445
01:23:55,791 --> 01:23:59,124
Then I'll cut his balls off.

446
01:24:03,215 --> 01:24:08,423
You know, if you really
wanted to hurt Rifki...

447
01:24:10,014 --> 01:24:16,019
His money. Steal that
and you steal his life's blood.

448
01:24:16,772 --> 01:24:21,649
Could you see his face if everything
he had got snatched?

449
01:24:21,819 --> 01:24:25,983
- If we only knew where he hid it.
- I know where it is.

450
01:24:26,991 --> 01:24:29,447
Max...

451
01:24:31,246 --> 01:24:34,033
The money?

452
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:40,171
Them that hides can find, says I.

453
01:24:44,677 --> 01:24:48,626
I've seen him, the big tit.

454
01:24:50,933 --> 01:24:55,929
He looks at it, late at night.

455
01:24:59,067 --> 01:25:02,768
Talking to it.

456
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:06,818
Where?

457
01:25:10,038 --> 01:25:13,289
Max, where?

458
01:25:15,501 --> 01:25:18,669
The money, where?

459
01:25:21,175 --> 01:25:27,843
In his radio.
In the back of his radio.

460
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:35,144
Thas why he never plays it.

461
01:27:33,232 --> 01:27:37,730
- He never had one.
- Soon he's back on the street.

462
01:27:37,905 --> 01:27:44,619
No friends, no money,
plenty of enemies.

463
01:27:44,786 --> 01:27:48,155
- I'll drink to that.
- Me, too.

464
01:27:50,334 --> 01:27:57,546
- I've just got some news on Jimmy.
- Really? What?

465
01:27:57,717 --> 01:28:02,877
They sent him to hospital.
They ruptured his hernia again.

466
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:09,676
- Shit!
- I guess he didn't talk.

467
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:18,193
- Look at Rifki, wearing a suit.
- Maybe he's got a new job.

468
01:28:27,124 --> 01:28:29,200
Jesus! Not again.

469
01:29:14,424 --> 01:29:16,797
Hashish.

470
01:29:33,988 --> 01:29:37,819
You're kidding! Me?

471
01:29:42,747 --> 01:29:46,329
I didn't sell him anything.

472
01:29:58,471 --> 01:30:02,386
Rifki's lying. He's a liar!

473
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:19,573
Rifki!

474
01:34:22,964 --> 01:34:26,000
Cigare, cigare, s'il vous plait.

475
01:34:41,066 --> 01:34:44,602
Please, listen to me.

476
01:36:36,775 --> 01:36:42,812
Excuse me, I've been wanting
to speak to you. You're an American?

477
01:36:42,988 --> 01:36:47,319
Yes, America.
My name is Ahmet.

478
01:36:47,494 --> 01:36:53,081
I studied philosophy at Harvard,
and also at Oxford.

479
01:36:53,249 --> 01:36:58,375
I also studied in Vienna,
and now I study here.

480
01:36:58,547 --> 01:37:03,256
They put me here.
They say I raped a little child.

481
01:37:03,428 --> 01:37:07,805
They'll never let me go.
They won't let you go, either.

482
01:37:07,973 --> 01:37:13,763
They tell you they'll let you go,
but in fact you stay.

483
01:37:13,938 --> 01:37:19,609
You see, we all of us
come from a factory.

484
01:37:19,778 --> 01:37:24,737
Sometimes the factory makes
bad machines that don't work.

485
01:37:24,908 --> 01:37:29,405
The bad machines
don't know they're bad machines.

486
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:36,829
But the factory knows you are one
of the machines that doesn't work.

487
01:37:37,005 --> 01:37:41,668
I think we've spoken enough
for today.

488
01:37:41,844 --> 01:37:44,679
I wish you goodnight.

489
01:39:27,123 --> 01:39:30,207
My God!

490
01:39:34,922 --> 01:39:36,963
Billy!

491
01:39:40,721 --> 01:39:44,968
What have they done to you?

492
01:39:49,522 --> 01:39:53,140
Your family is fine.

493
01:39:55,988 --> 01:40:00,696
Senator Buckley has made
a special plea on your behalf.

494
01:40:00,867 --> 01:40:05,577
They've called you a pawn in the
game between Nixon and the Turks.

495
01:40:05,748 --> 01:40:10,042
The letters are coming in.
People do care.

496
01:40:16,967 --> 01:40:20,633
What?

497
01:40:20,805 --> 01:40:23,379
Take it off.

498
01:40:23,558 --> 01:40:30,973
- You'll just make yourself...
- Take it off.

499
01:40:34,319 --> 01:40:36,858
S'il vous plait.

500
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:14,480
Billy...

501
01:41:16,574 --> 01:41:23,111
I wish I could make it better
for you. Please, don't.

502
01:41:25,374 --> 01:41:28,044
Don't.

503
01:41:42,393 --> 01:41:47,351
- Susan.
- Yes, Billy.

504
01:41:47,523 --> 01:41:51,438
I love you.

505
01:41:55,866 --> 01:41:59,401
I love you.

506
01:42:07,128 --> 01:42:10,746
Your father gave me this for you.

507
01:42:10,923 --> 01:42:15,918
There's pictures of your mom
and dad, and Rob and Peg.

508
01:42:16,095 --> 01:42:21,850
And in the back there's a picture
of your old friend Mr. Franklin.

509
01:42:23,187 --> 01:42:26,602
Remember him? From the bank.

510
01:42:28,358 --> 01:42:33,270
He's over in Greece now.
He bought a ticket.

511
01:42:36,242 --> 01:42:41,699
I'll give it to them for you.

512
01:42:41,874 --> 01:42:47,663
Don't count on them.
Don't count on anyone but yourself.

513
01:42:56,514 --> 01:43:00,975
You're running out of time.
If you stay here, you'll die.

514
01:43:01,144 --> 01:43:07,349
You've got to get yourself together.
You've got to get out of here.

515
01:44:47,884 --> 01:44:51,467
Good morning, my American friend.

516
01:44:51,639 --> 01:44:56,347
There will be trouble
if you go this way.

517
01:44:56,517 --> 01:45:00,563
A good Turk
always walks to the right.

518
01:45:00,730 --> 01:45:05,559
Left is Communist.
Right is good.

519
01:45:08,530 --> 01:45:13,323
You must go the other way.

520
01:45:13,494 --> 01:45:16,863
The other way is good.

521
01:45:19,292 --> 01:45:23,372
Where are you going?
Why don't you walk the wheel?

522
01:45:23,546 --> 01:45:28,375
What is the matter,
my American friend?

523
01:45:32,473 --> 01:45:36,422
A bad machine
doesn't know he's a bad machine.

524
01:45:36,601 --> 01:45:42,475
You still don't believe
you're a bad machine?

525
01:45:42,650 --> 01:45:45,770
To know yourself is to know God.

526
01:45:45,945 --> 01:45:50,655
The factory knows,
thas why they put you here.

527
01:45:50,826 --> 01:45:56,865
- In time you'll know.
- I already know.

528
01:45:57,041 --> 01:46:02,996
You are a bad machine, thas why
the factory keeps you here.

529
01:46:03,172 --> 01:46:06,090
Do you know how I know?

530
01:46:06,259 --> 01:46:11,052
I know because I'm from the factory.

531
01:46:11,223 --> 01:46:14,259
I make the machines.

532
01:48:48,891 --> 01:48:53,020
Max.

533
01:48:55,107 --> 01:48:58,108
Max!

534
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:08,907
I'm going away.
I've come to say goodbye.

535
01:49:10,623 --> 01:49:15,831
You see, if I stay here,
I'm going to die.

536
01:49:16,004 --> 01:49:20,714
You'll die. Don't die, Max.

537
01:49:20,885 --> 01:49:24,752
Please, don't die.

538
01:49:24,930 --> 01:49:28,430
I'm going to come back for you.

539
01:49:28,601 --> 01:49:32,849
You hang on for me.

540
01:51:28,104 --> 01:51:33,644
You're not taking me
to the sanatorium!
