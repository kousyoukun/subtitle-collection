1
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,990
Excuse me.

2
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,869
- Nervous?
- No.

3
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,477
- I hate flying.
- It's something I ate.

4
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:27,476
Maybe you're just excited
about getting home.

5
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,554
- I've got to go to the john again.
- I'll wait.

6
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,748
- No, I'll catch up to you. Okay?
- Okay.

7
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,398
Passport.

8
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,235
Basket.

9
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,916
It's a frisbee.

10
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,073
You throw it and catch it.
It's a game.

11
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,789
A game...

12
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,395
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, great. Want a piece of gum?

13
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,434
Thank you.

14
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,434
See this?
Janis Joplin died yesterday.

15
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,558
Overdose.
There never was anyone like Janis.

16
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,396
- There never was anyone like you.
- Knock it off.

17
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,155
- You never take anything seriously.
- Nothing.

18
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,597
- What's he saying?
- I don't know.

19
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,880
They always have everything
ass backwards in Turkey.

20
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,632
- Billy, what's the matter?
- Passport. Susan, get on the plane.

21
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:28,990
- What's wrong, are you sick?
- Get on the plane. Go.

22
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,956
I'm looking for my passport.

23
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,712
Harry, you'd better
get rid of those grenades.

24
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,673
Get down.

25
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,878
- Name?
- William Hayes.

26
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,715
- William...
- Hayes.

27
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,839
Hayes.

28
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,276
- American?
- That's right.

29
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,513
Yes, American. United States.

30
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,240
American.

31
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,158
- Name?
- Jesus... William Hayes.

32
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,759
- Name?
- Hayes. H-A-Y-E-S.

33
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,509
Howdy, Billy.
How are you doing? Okay?

34
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,989
I think these gentlemen
have finished for the time being.

35
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,914
If you'd like
to put your clothes on.

36
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,798
The officer wants to know
if you're afraid.

37
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,077
No, I'm not afraid.

38
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,514
The officer said
there's nothing to be afraid of.

39
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,434
Co-operate,
and you'll be on the plane home.

40
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:54,469
- Where did you get the hashish?
- From a cab driver.

41
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,518
In the playing shop at the bazaar.

42
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,677
- Would you recognise him again?
- I think so.

43
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,552
You decided to fly at a bad time.

44
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,113
Guerrillas all over the place,
blowing up planes...

45
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,876
Four planes in four days.
Don't you read the newspapers?

46
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,033
There's been a shit storm
over the flow of heroin from Turkey.

47
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,909
- I didn't have heroin.
- A drug is a drug.

48
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,517
It was my first time.
It was only two kilos.

49
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,070
It doesn't matter
if it was 2 or 200 kilos.

50
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,358
Catching you shows the world
Turkey is fighting the drug trade.

51
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,878
- Are you with the Consulate?
- Something like that. Cigarette?

52
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,396
- What did you pay this cab driver?
- $200. My last 200.

53
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,792
- How much did you figure to make?
- I'd only sell it to my friends.

54
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,953
- I'm not a pusher. Honest.
- It beats working.

55
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,240
- Have you got a family?
- Mother, father, brother, sister.

56
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,313
- Long Island.
- It'll be tough on them.

57
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,632
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah, she was on the plane.

58
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:38,593
- She didn't know anything about it.
- Lucky girl.

59
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,276
- She used to say I was lucky.
- Let's hope so, Billy.

60
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,118
You seem like a nice enough kid.

61
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,149
But you try it,
and I'll blow your brains out.

62
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,553
<i>Mom and Dad, this is the hardest
letter I've ever had to write.</i>

63
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,955
<i>I hoped to get out of this quickly,
so you'd never know about it.</i>

64
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,229
<i>But that just isn't possible now.
I don't know what's going to happen.</i>

65
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,598
<i>What can I say to you?
Will "I'm sorry" make a difference?</i>

66
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,550
<i>Will it ease the pain,
the shame you must be feeling?</i>

67
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,996
<i>Forgive me, please.</i>

68
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,757
Could I have a blanket?

69
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,276
It's cold.
Could I have a blanket?

70
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,436
- A blanket!
- Too late. Tomorrow.

71
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:26,551
He'll be here tomorrow, I think.
Goodnight.

72
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,153
- Can you speak English?
- Your cell is open.

73
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,518
Blankets, three cells down.
You get me one.

74
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,914
I needed a blanket.

75
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,678
William Hayes.

76
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,397
I needed a blanket, I was cold!

77
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,069
Jesus...

78
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,357
Come on, you must stand.

79
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,114
You'd better walk around,
or your feet will swell up.

80
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:19,152
- You've got to be crazy.
- We all are. Smoke some of this.

81
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,314
You've been out for days,
talking all kinds of shit.

82
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,870
- How does it feel?
- About as good as it looks.

83
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:37,151
<i>Gecmis olsun. It's Turkish.
It means, "May it pass quickly. "</i>

84
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,559
- It looks like a cheap hotel.
- The room service is lousy.

85
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,838
I'm Jimmy Booth.
This is Erich... something Swedish.

86
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,958
- Just Erich.
- He cleaned you up.

87
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,511
Thanks. I'm Billy Hayes...
at least I used to be.

88
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,393
- Why peacocks?
- They use them instead of dogs.

89
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:41,954
They scream like mad if they're
disturbed and they don't get rabies.

90
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,074
- Who are the kids?
- Little fuckers...

91
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,631
Thieves, rapists, murderers...
You name it, they do it.

92
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,713
Don't trust any of them.
They tell Rifki everything.

93
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,031
He's the squeal around here.
He sells tea, -

94
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,829
- hash, blankets,
anything for a buck.

95
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,869
- What are you in for, hash?
- Yeah.

96
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,158
- Where?
- At the airport.

97
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:19,236
That's heavy.
This ain't the good old USA.

98
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,029
In Turkey, it's a fucking accident
if you're innocent.

99
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,671
- Nobody here is innocent.
- Don't pay too much attention.

100
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,233
Anything is possible in Turkey.
They may not hit you for smuggling.

101
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,279
If they make it possession,
you might even get bail.

102
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,594
If you make bail, you're free.
Sneak across the border to Greece.

103
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:48,551
Sure, keep dreaming.
See where it gets you. Like Max.

104
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,872
It's going to be a while
before you taste a hamburger again.

105
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,352
- You broke the law.
- The law is sometimes wrong.

106
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,318
The law is never wrong!

107
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,910
The fucking law is.

108
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,114
- People get on his nerves.
- What's he in for?

109
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,078
Stealing from a mosque.

110
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,391
- What did he steal?
- Two candlesticks.

111
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,711
- That's all?
- Jimmy has more balls than brains.

112
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,670
He was in for a year and a half
before he even told his parents.

113
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:36,039
- What about you?
- Hashish, like most foreigners.

114
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,716
- What did they give you?
- 12 years. I had 100 grams.

115
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,876
You've got to get a good lawyer.
Talk to the Englishman. Max.

116
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,749
He's been in the longest.
Seven years.

117
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,598
Gastro. Stomach medicine.

118
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,189
It's got codeine in it.
It's the best I can do around here.

119
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,635
Max...

120
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,839
- Lawyers...?
- Oh, yeah.

121
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,873
There's no straight lawyers
in Turkey.

122
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,510
They're all bent.

123
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,754
Bent as hairpins.
Occupational necessity.

124
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:43,516
They have special classes
in corruption at night school.

125
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,515
If you're suspected of honesty,
you're disbarred.

126
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,797
I knew a lawyer fellow once.

127
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,431
He got that Frenchman off.
La Roche.

128
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,632
A big smuggler.

129
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,997
200 kilos.

130
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,876
He put enough bread
in enough pockets. Got bail.

131
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,510
Vanished.

132
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:26,356
- His name?
- Who?

133
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:31,719
- The lawyer.
- Lawyer?

134
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,396
Who got the Frenchman off.

135
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:43,797
Yesil is his name.

136
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,434
I don't know anything else
about him.

137
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,876
Yesil.

138
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:59,470
The best thing to do
is get your ass out of here.

139
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,872
- Yeah, but how?
- Catch the midnight express.

140
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,077
What's that?

141
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:18,315
It's not a train.
It's a prison word for... escape.

142
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,758
It doesn't stop around here.

143
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,638
Dad, I'm sorry.

144
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,872
Forget it.

145
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:23,559
I'll punch you in the nose later.
We've got to get you out of here.

146
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:28,236
This is a suit I brought for you.

147
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,830
Smarten you up a little.

148
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,799
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

149
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,191
How's Mom?

150
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,194
Well, she's bad.

151
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,990
She couldn't make the trip.
You know Mom. Her boy...

152
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,269
Susan told us
before we got your letter.

153
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,512
She's saving to come back here...

154
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:07,118
Don't let her come.
How's Rob? How's Peg?

155
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,431
They're the same. You know.

156
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:15,594
We told the neighbours
you were in hospital in Europe.

157
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,995
This is Stanley Daniels.
He's the American Consul here.

158
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:29,635
Billy, we're going to do everything
in our power to get you out of here.

159
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:36,433
That's Necdit Yesil,
the lawyer you asked for.

160
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,593
I know exactly what you feel,
but you must not worry.

161
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,799
We'll get the right court
and the right judge.

162
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,270
I'll arrange everything, just right.

163
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:55,795
I understand that if you get bail,
it's easy to get across the border.

164
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:02,069
That's what we're shooting for.
I've spoken to the State Department.

165
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,314
Right now, relations with the Turks
aren't too good. Nixon upset them.

166
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:13,510
- Our best bet is right here.
- Dad, I'll pay you back for this.

167
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:17,878
Money doesn't matter, Billy.
Not at this stage.

168
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:29,351
- Where did you get that limp?
- I twisted my ankle.

169
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,310
- Where are you staying?
- The Hilton.

170
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,759
- How do you like Istanbul?
- Interesting place.

171
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:45,153
The food is lousy. The crap
they sell in the restaurants...

172
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,314
I had to run to the toilet.
You should have seen the toilet.

173
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:57,556
I'll eat at the Hilton every night.
Steak, French fries and ketchup.

174
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,677
Billy...

175
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:13,915
- Why did you do it?
- Money.

176
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,715
I know you kids smoke that stuff
and we drink booze, -

177
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,998
- but taking it across he border,
that's stupid.

178
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,515
I know.

179
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,277
Dad... get me out of here.

180
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,070
I promise you. Just sit tight.

181
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,950
Let me work with Mr. Daniels
and Mr. Yesil here.

182
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,237
We'll get you out, okay?

183
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,188
Hey, Billy... Okay?

184
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,195
Okay.

185
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,152
- What did that prosecutor say?
- It's not important.

186
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,440
We made our case. You spoke well.
The judge liked you.

187
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,309
Mr. Hayes, the judge is coming back.

188
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,799
- Four years, two months.
- Four years?

189
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,951
We'll appeal.

190
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:53,956
It'll be reduced for good behaviour.
It is only for possession.

191
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:58,796
The prosecutor wanted
a life sentence for smuggling.

192
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,273
To be honest, Mr. Hayes,
it is a great victory.

193
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:20,355
With good time,
it works out to about three years.

194
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,557
And then there's the appeal.

195
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:31,798
Daniels and Yesil
are all working for you.

196
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,589
We're trying to get you transferred.

197
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:41,392
Daniels thinks there might be
a political amnesty any month now.

198
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,634
All right, Billy...

199
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,238
I know it sounds tough,
but we are going to get you out.

200
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,520
I promise you.
Don't do anything stupid.

201
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,229
They could play with your sentence.

202
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,032
All right, now...

203
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,635
I'm putting $500 in the bank.
Anything you need, you write.

204
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,794
There's food here,
candy, writing paper, -

205
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:28,991
- books, cigarettes, soap,
toothbrush...

206
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,152
I've sold insurance for 30 years.

207
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,790
Now I've got to see my own son...

208
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,317
Jesus!

209
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,792
If I could be where you are...
I'd be there.

210
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,910
I love you, Dad.

211
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,752
You take good care of my boy,
or I'll have your fucking head!

212
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,836
<i>Dear Susan,
1970 has now passed into 1971.</i>

213
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,834
<i>You can drift in here
and never know you're gone.</i>

214
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,996
<i>You can fade so far out, you
don't know where you are anymore.</i>

215
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:28,238
<i>I find loneliness is a physical pain
that hurts all over.</i>

216
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,511
<i>To the Turks
everything is "söyle böyle".</i>

217
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,468
<i>It means "like this, like that. "
You never know what will happen.</i>

218
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,312
<i>All foreigners are "ayip. "
They're considered dirty.</i>

219
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:16,429
<i>So is homosexuality, but they
do it every chance they get.</i>

220
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:21,037
<i>There are about 1,000 things
that are "hyip".</i>

221
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,228
<i>You can stab or shoot somebody
below the waist but not above.</i>

222
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:32,434
<i>Stabbing somebody in the ass
is considered Turkish revenge.</i>

223
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,715
<i>I know it must sound crazy to you,
but this place is crazy.</i>

224
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,356
<i>One day,
one of the new kids was raped.</i>

225
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,752
<i>So they picked out
four of the worst kids.</i>

226
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,351
<i>Then there's Rifki. The more
I know of him, the more I hate him.</i>

227
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,229
$10 for this shit? You pig.

228
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,870
There are no pigs in Turkey.

229
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:38,910
- This shit is shit.
- No, it's good. Good shit.

230
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,914
- You big shit.
- Yeah, me big shit.

231
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,352
You asshole.

232
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:13,031
What is it with you?
Just what the hell is it, man?

233
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,669
You don't fuck with me,
I don't fuck with you.

234
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,674
You fuck with me all the time.
You make crummy tea.

235
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:30,598
- You rip us off on the hash.
- I make special tea for you.

236
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:35,470
We have to live like brothers.
We have to be in here together.

237
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:39,315
For all the money you've got,
you've got nothing.

238
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:44,156
- You are American, you don't know.
- Know what?

239
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,390
Dog eat dog.

240
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,633
You fuck other man before he
fucks you. And you must fuck last.

241
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,508
Come on down.

242
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:14,593
Egbert...
Sodding cat.

243
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,875
William!

244
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,272
Are you all right?

245
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,911
The new American Ambassador
is following your case.

246
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:54,710
He says there is progress.
You want a cigarette?

247
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,432
But there is another route...

248
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,517
...that is quite possible.

249
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,150
For a proper amount of money,
it is possible -

250
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:11,871
- to convince the ten officials
to lose track of your papers -

251
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:16,591
- before the High Court in Ankara
confirms your sentence.

252
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:24,633
And you could be in Greece by
the time they discover the mistake.

253
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:34,435
But I have to act before the
official sentence is handed down.

254
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:42,672
And for that
I must pay certain officials.

255
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,710
What's that?

256
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,670
The blueprints to the prison, man.

257
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:13,710
There was this German architect
in the hospital.

258
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,553
He let me copy them.

259
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,599
It's too bad
you didn't have a Xerox machine.

260
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,838
There are two ways out of here.

261
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,869
One is over the roof,
but that's kind of risky.

262
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:35,637
The other way, I'll need your help,
and that is under.

263
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,475
A tunnel?

264
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:46,272
- Are you serious?
- This is not Stalag 17.

265
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:51,389
That's where you're wrong.
The tunnel is already built.

266
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:55,473
There's a basement
where they used to keep weapons.

267
00:52:55,640 --> 00:53:02,318
Beneath that are the catacombs the
Christians built to bury their dead.

268
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,917
We're sitting
right on top of it... here.

269
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,438
The kraut says that there's
a bunch of hollow shafts.

270
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,798
They're like dumbwaiters,
all along these walls.

271
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,794
One of them
is right next to our shower.

272
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,509
If we get in there,
we can get down into the catacombs.

273
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,468
With three of us working,
it shouldn't take too long.

274
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:34,430
I swear I heard a couple of dead
Christians singing down there.

275
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:41,517
- You stop shitting me, man. Okay?
- How do we get into the shaft?

276
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,798
We knock three times and
say we're a friend of the deceased.

277
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:51,557
I'm getting this together and
I don't need no gastro-head along.

278
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,712
You understand me?

279
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,072
- We go through the wall.
- We go through the wall?

280
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,598
Go through the wall.

281
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:35,993
There's no reinforced steel
in those shower walls.

282
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:41,632
It's real soft
from underground seepage.

283
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,997
You can almost push it over.

284
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,311
All we have to do...

285
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,429
We only have to use your screwdriver
to scrape the mortar out.

286
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,354
We pull out three stones
and squeeze through...

287
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:10,632
Squeeze through,
and get our ass down the shaft.

288
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,316
- It's a two-night operation.
- What do we do in the catacombs?

289
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,358
What do you want, a door?

290
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,069
There's miles of them down there.

291
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:27,030
- You must be fucking crazy.
- They've got to come up someplace.

292
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:33,435
You won't find any catacombs,
you'll just finish up in section 13.

293
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:39,832
Billy... the tunnel or the roof?

294
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,470
Forget the wall.
Rifki's always there.

295
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:49,317
- The roof is guarded.
- Help me get into the shaft.

296
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,712
If we get caught,
I'll get the shaft.

297
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:58,317
I'll be back up to
three years again, maybe more.

298
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,956
Fuck it, then.
You choose your own death.

299
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:09,353
I'll do this thing on my own.
I'm taking the roof out of here.

300
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,912
No! I can't take it!

301
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,909
<i>Dear Susan,
Jimmy was caught and beaten badly.</i>

302
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:14,755
<i>He got a severe hernia
and lost a testicle.</i>

303
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:18,469
<i>He's been in the sanatorium
for months.</i>

304
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,633
<i>In comparison,
my problems seem small.</i>

305
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:27,032
<i>But 2 1/2 years have gone by.</i>

306
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:31,751
<i>The Turks
are slowly draining my life away.</i>

307
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:47,830
- Why do you keep your hair short?
- To remind me that I hate it here.

308
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:41,999
Prison, monastery, cloister, cave.

309
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:07,593
Prison...

310
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:07,716
- Okay.
- I've thought of another way.

311
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:11,839
- Another way what?
- Out of here.

312
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,472
When I was in the sanatorium,
there was only one guard on duty.

313
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:22,031
- I could have got out of there.
- Why didn't you?

314
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:27,274
As soon as I could walk,
they threw me back in here.

315
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:31,718
- Lucky you.
- I tell you, Billy...

316
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:36,795
Another ward in the sanatorium
had no guard on it at all.

317
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,952
- Who was in it?
- Three guys.

318
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:44,636
- What was wrong with them?
- I don't know.

319
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:50,396
- I think they were dead.
- It figures.

320
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:02,358
I've got to go. It's Daniels!
Turkish justice has done it again.

321
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:08,356
They're going to let me off.
Jimmy, I'm going home!

322
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:13,275
God! "I've got to go. "

323
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,472
What's wrong?

324
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,871
Sit down, Billy.

325
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:40,955
I'm afraid
I have some bad news for you.

326
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:46,038
- Is it Dad? Mom?
- No.

327
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:52,309
- You're going to have a new court.
- What do you mean?

328
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:57,315
The prosecutor objected
to your sentence for possession.

329
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:01,837
He wanted a smuggling conviction.
The Ankara court reviewed it.

330
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:08,109
It seems everyone wanted
an example made. A scapegoat.

331
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:16,755
We've been notified
that they rejected the sentence.

332
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,037
There were 35 judges in the court.

333
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,909
28 voted for... a life sentence.

334
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:31,876
The lower court in Istanbul
had to go along with the decision.

335
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:36,795
The judge likes you.
He notified your dad.

336
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,157
What do you mean, life?

337
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:44,393
- Life for what?
- Billy!

338
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:49,714
I have 53 days left!

339
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:10,229
So now it's time for me to speak.

340
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,188
What is there for me to say?

341
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:19,718
When I finish,
you'll sentence me for my crime.

342
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,917
So let me ask you now:

343
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,833
What is a crime?

344
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,673
What is a punishment?

345
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:34,836
It seems to vary from time to time
and place to place.

346
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,916
What's legal today
is suddenly illegal tomorrow.

347
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:47,349
What's illegal is suddenly legal
because everybody's doing it.

348
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:51,354
You can't put everybody in jail.

349
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,550
I'm not saying
this is right or wrong.

350
01:04:55,720 --> 01:05:00,430
I'm just saying
that's the way it is.

351
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:07,509
I've spent 3 1/2 years of my life
in your prison.

352
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:12,196
I think I've paid for my error.

353
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:20,351
If it's your decision today
to sentence me to more years...

354
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:39,953
My lawyer... that's a good one.
He says, "Be cool, Billy. "

355
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:46,275
"Be good. I'll get you a pardon,
an amnesty, an appeal. "

356
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:52,114
This has been going on now
for 3 1/2 years.

357
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:57,513
I've been playing it cool.
I've been good.

358
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:06,348
Now I'm damn tired of being good.
You said I had 53 days left.

359
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:13,471
You hung 53 days in my face,
and then you took them away.

360
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,234
And you!

361
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:20,552
I wish you could be standing
where I'm standing right now.

362
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:24,599
Then you would know something
that you don't know.

363
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:27,558
Mercy!

364
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:34,990
You would know that a just society
is based on the concept of mercy.

365
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:38,277
Its sense of fair play and justice.

366
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:44,439
But I guess that's like asking
a bear to shit in a toilet.

367
01:06:55,160 --> 01:07:00,154
For a nation of pigs,
it sure is funny you don't eat them.

368
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:13,918
Jesus Christ forgave the bastards,
but I can't.

369
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:21,436
I hate.

370
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:24,194
I hate you.

371
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:29,229
I hate your nation
and I hate your people.

372
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:35,077
I fuck your sons and daughters
because they're pigs.

373
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:37,754
You're a pig.

374
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:46,435
You're all pigs.

375
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:12,752
My hands are tied by Ankara.

376
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:22,990
I must sentence you, William Hayes,
to be imprisoned -

377
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:26,152
- for a term no less than 30 years.

378
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,870
May it pass quickly.

379
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:59,072
<i>Got the old Istanbul blues</i>

380
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:02,596
<i>Istanbul blues</i>

381
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:08,073
<i>they give me 30 years</i>

382
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:12,153
<i>ain't got nothing left to lose...</i>

383
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:17,075
<i>We are going to get you out.
I promise you.</i>

384
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:22,678
<i>Don't do anything stupid.
They could play with your sentence.</i>

385
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:32,118
<i>I was busted at the border...</i>

386
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:37,229
<i>The best thing to do
is get your ass out of here.</i>

387
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:40,949
<i>The best way you can.</i>

388
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:21,838
Hey, I think I found it.
Come here.

389
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:27,153
Listen to that.
Do you hear anything?

390
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,039
I told you, you suckers.
You didn't believe me.

391
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,590
Keep it down.

392
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:43,834
Look how soft this is.
It'll be easy.

393
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:51,509
Go and get Rifki's poker,
but don't wake him up.

394
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:13,274
It's really soft. It's coming.

395
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:20,869
- Jimmy, it's coming.
- Here, use this.

396
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:28,835
It's coming real easy.
It's coming right out.

397
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,074
It's easier than I thought.
It's a piece of cake.

398
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:47,112
It's coming.

399
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,874
Like butter.

400
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:55,869
Hey, Max. Rifki.

401
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:14,795
- Keep checking for Rifki.
- It's okay.

402
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:34,354
- Watch it.
- I thought you wanted out of here.

403
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:41,916
- They're loose.
- Let's try.

404
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:45,629
- Watch your hernia.
- Fuck that.

405
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:54,799
- Okay? You got it?
- Yeah.

406
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:06,428
That's it. It's the shaft.

407
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,554
It's coming.

408
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:26,028
It's okay.

409
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:37,029
- Let's go, Billy.
- It's too late. We're not prepared.

410
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,715
We'll go tomorrow.
It's too late.

411
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,952
Let's put them back. Help me.

412
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,349
Any fuck-ups
and we should be back by dawn.

413
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:16,308
You got everything?

414
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:21,190
Maps, railroad, bus timetables.

415
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,909
Okay, let's do it.

416
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,236
- Can you see?
- No.

417
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:47,591
Come on, Max,
get your ass down here.

418
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:52,754
This way to Istanbul, baby.

419
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:01,278
Watch it.
Mind how you go there.

420
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:09,588
Are you all right?
Come down this pole and cross over.

421
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:14,196
Terrific.

422
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:21,832
- All right, it's a tunnel.
- Let's go.

423
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:47,232
Come on, Max.

424
01:16:56,520 --> 01:17:00,035
Fuck! What is that? Shit!

425
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:21,913
Shit! It's a dead end.
The Turks must have blocked it up.

426
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:25,197
Shit!

427
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:30,029
Billy!

428
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:36,793
- What the fuck are we going to do?
- What time is it?

429
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:40,350
4:30.

430
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:48,675
- Go back.
- You must be fucking joking.

431
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:53,914
We go back, seal it up,
and come back tomorrow.

432
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:58,073
Every night, until we get out.

433
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:02,074
There's got to be a way out.

434
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:19,909
Billy, they found it. Rifki.

435
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,912
No do, no do.

436
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:28,311
I'm going to kick your brains
all over your fucking kitchen.

437
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:31,790
Fine! Good. Man to man.

438
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:38,672
When we're finished, I'll bring
Hamidou and he'll kick your ass.

439
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,552
Let's go, Max. Come on.

440
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:56,837
- I know what I'm going to do.
- What?

441
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,993
- I'm going to cut his throat.
- Whose?

442
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:04,072
Rifki.

443
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:13,359
What have I got to lose?
Anyway, I'd really enjoy it.

444
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:22,356
Why don't you sit down?
You're in no shape to kill anybody.

445
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:27,753
- I want to cut his fucking throat.
- It's already been cut.

446
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:37,037
Then I'll cut his balls off.

447
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:45,954
You know, if you really
wanted to hurt Rifki...

448
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:53,237
His money. Steal that
and you steal his life's blood.

449
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:58,636
Could you see his face if everything
he had got snatched?

450
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,793
- If we only knew where he hid it.
- I know where it is.

451
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,115
Max...

452
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,513
The money?

453
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:16,399
Them that hides can find, says I.

454
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:24,508
I've seen him, the big tit.

455
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:31,510
He looks at it, late at night.

456
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:38,069
Talking to it.

457
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,953
Where?

458
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:48,157
Max, where?

459
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:53,317
The money, where?

460
01:21:55,720 --> 01:22:02,114
In his radio.
In the back of his radio.

461
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:09,116
That's why he never plays it.

462
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:06,672
- He never had one.
- Soon he's back on the street.

463
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:13,279
No friends, no money,
plenty of enemies.

464
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,671
- I'll drink to that.
- Me, too.

465
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:25,677
- I've just got some news on Jimmy.
- Really? What?

466
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:30,789
They sent him to hospital.
They ruptured his hernia again.

467
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:37,309
- Shit!
- I guess he didn't talk.

468
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:45,475
- Look at Rifki, wearing a suit.
- Maybe he's got a new job.

469
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:56,031
Jesus! Not again.

470
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,675
Hashish.

471
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:01,835
You're kidding! Me?

472
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:09,996
I didn't sell him anything.

473
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:25,394
Rifki's lying. He's a liar!

474
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,875
Rifki!

475
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:38,192
<i>Cigare, cigare, s'il vous plait.</i>

476
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:56,030
Please, listen to me.

477
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:49,391
Excuse me, I've been wanting
to speak to you. You're an American?

478
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:53,712
Yes, America.
My name is Ahmet.

479
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:59,238
I studied philosophy at Harvard,
and also at Oxford.

480
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:04,315
I also studied in Vienna,
and now I study here.

481
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:08,996
They put me here.
They say I raped a little child.

482
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:13,358
They'll never let me go.
They won't let you go, either.

483
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:19,072
They tell you they'll let you go,
but in fact you stay.

484
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:24,678
You see, we all of us
come from a factory.

485
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:29,595
Sometimes the factory makes
bad machines that don't work.

486
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:34,072
The bad machines
don't know they're bad machines.

487
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:41,191
But the factory knows you are one
of the machines that doesn't work.

488
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:45,831
I think we've spoken enough
for today.

489
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,719
I wish you goodnight.

490
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:29,918
My God!

491
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:36,396
Billy!

492
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,073
What have they done to you?

493
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:51,910
Your family is fine.

494
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:59,156
Senator Buckley has made
a special plea on your behalf.

495
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:03,836
They've called you a pawn in the
game between Nixon and the Turks.

496
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,118
The letters are coming in.
People do care.

497
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:18,275
What?

498
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:20,908
Take it off.

499
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:28,191
- You'll just make yourself...
- Take it off.

500
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:33,834
<i>S'il vous plait.</i>

501
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,913
Billy...

502
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:18,189
I wish I could make it better
for you. Please, don't.

503
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:22,920
Don't.

504
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:41,435
- Susan.
- Yes, Billy.

505
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:45,354
I love you.

506
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:52,990
I love you.

507
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:03,870
Your father gave me this for you.

508
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:08,830
There's pictures of your mom
and dad, and Rob and Peg.

509
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:14,518
And in the back there's a picture
of your old friend Mr. Franklin.

510
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:19,076
Remember him? From the bank.

511
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:25,470
He's over in Greece now.
He bought a ticket.

512
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:33,553
I'll give it to them for you.

513
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:39,272
Don't count on them.
Don't count on anyone but yourself.

514
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:52,038
You're running out of time.
If you stay here, you'll die.

515
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:58,150
You've got to get yourself together.
You've got to get out of here.

516
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:37,996
Good morning, my American friend.

517
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:42,676
There will be trouble
if you go this way.

518
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:46,719
A good Turk
always walks to the right.

519
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:51,510
Left is Communist.
Right is good.

520
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:58,956
You must go the other way.

521
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:02,351
The other way is good.

522
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:08,593
Where are you going?
Why don't you walk the wheel?

523
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:13,390
What is the matter,
my American friend?

524
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:21,108
A bad machine
doesn't know he's a bad machine.

525
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:26,912
You still don't believe
you're a bad machine?

526
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:30,072
To know yourself is to know God.

527
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:34,756
The factory knows,
that's why they put you here.

528
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:40,711
- In time you'll know.
- I already know.

529
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:46,591
You are a bad machine, that's why
the factory keeps you here.

530
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:49,558
Do you know how I know?

531
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:54,316
I know because I'm from the factory.

532
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:57,392
I make the machines.

533
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:29,639
Max.

534
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:34,518
Max!

535
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:44,874
I'm going away.
I've come to say goodbye.

536
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:51,514
You see, if I stay here,
I'm going to die.

537
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:56,196
You'll die. Don't die, Max.

538
01:44:56,360 --> 01:45:00,069
Please, don't die.

539
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:03,596
I'm going to come back for you.

540
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:07,833
You hang on for me.

541
01:46:58,360 --> 01:47:03,673
You're not taking me
to the sanatorium!
