2
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:35,701
Prayer:
<i>Arabic: Subhaana Rabbiyal a'laa wa bihamdih....(3x)
English: Praise only to The Most Holly and The Most High (Allah, The True God) 3x</i>

3
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:38,701
<i>Arabic: Allahu Akbar
English: Allah is The Most Great</i>

4
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:49,201
- What time is it, sweetheart?
- It's okay, go back to sleep.

5
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:53,389
I know, but I told you to wake me up.

6
00:01:54,508 --> 00:01:57,496
You need to take some rests,
it's for both of you.

7
00:01:58,378 --> 00:02:00,378
I love you.

8
00:02:00,907 --> 00:02:05,279
I love you too.

9
00:02:05,932 --> 00:02:09,004
Wait for Daddy home, all right?

10
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:42,288
I'll bring him home.

11
00:02:56,015 --> 00:02:59,102
THE RAID : REDEMPTION

12
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,866
OK, listen guys!
Our target is Tama Riyadi.

13
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,290
I'm sure all of you here know who he is.

14
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,991
All the bad guys in this city
consider him as a legend in dark world,

15
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:32,403
as a drug supplier, a murderer, a robber.
Even a thug-wannabe thought so.

16
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,340
During the last 10 years his building
became a free-cops zone.

17
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:42,539
I don't care who support him,
and how big-influence he is,

18
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:46,449
Because now he dares to make his
apartment rooms for rent,

19
00:03:46,592 --> 00:03:48,992
As hiding place for the criminals that we hunt.

20
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:53,461
Our mission is simple ...

21
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,910
We enter,  take and drag him out!

22
00:03:56,997 --> 00:04:00,888
- Yes sir!
- Tama is not alone.

23
00:04:01,026 --> 00:04:05,226
Intelligence reports, there is
a big narcotics lab in there,

24
00:04:06,214 --> 00:04:09,914
And a mass of people who ready to
do anything to protect that place.

25
00:04:12,515 --> 00:04:14,515
He (Tama) has two trusted servant.

26
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:16,609
The first one called Mad Dog.

27
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:21,209
A "mad dog" that he dragged from the street,
that would do anything and die for him.

28
00:04:22,411 --> 00:04:25,811
Second one is named Andi.
The brain of Tama's business.

29
00:04:26,412 --> 00:04:28,912
And he's the only one who can hold
Mad Dog's tail.

30
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,340
Meanwhile, be cautious for these two people.

31
00:04:32,492 --> 00:04:35,489
If you were careless,
you guys got slaughtered by them.

32
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:40,552
Hey, no need for shaking, all right?
Be patient.

33
00:06:00,165 --> 00:06:02,165
Where were we at?

34
00:06:10,523 --> 00:06:12,523
Focus is necessary.

35
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:14,582
Secure the place floor by floor.

36
00:06:15,095 --> 00:06:18,092
Everyone concentrate on
each gun-point.

37
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:20,161
Why us? Why today?

38
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:25,712
- Why the hell not?
- That's a valid question!

39
00:06:26,535 --> 00:06:28,535
That's as valid as my answer!

40
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:31,278
Are we finished?

41
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,110
Should I continue? Yeah? hmm?

42
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:41,564
You need to know, that this is not
the first time that place is under attack.

43
00:06:42,284 --> 00:06:44,784
For many times, Tama's rivals tried
to overtake the place.

44
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:47,787
But always failed.

45
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:53,029
Be advice! These people are well-trained,
and well-prepared for war.

46
00:06:54,034 --> 00:06:56,034
30 seconds!

47
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Re-check the weapons!

48
00:07:11,195 --> 00:07:13,295
I don't want any empty seat when
we back home.

49
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:17,811
Let's go! We clean this city's mess!

50
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:54,511
- Morning, Sir!
- Morning.

51
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:58,511
- Who are they?
- They're new members.

52
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:02,211
My responsibility. I guarantee.
They won't disturb.

53
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:05,811
But you don't forget with our mission, right?

54
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:09,711
Lieutenant, to cover area that wide,
you should've known, we need more guys.

55
00:08:10,711 --> 00:08:12,991
Also as wide as the possibilty for mistakes.

56
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:14,991
They're beginners.

57
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:17,291
This is not a training camp!

58
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:20,291
Okay. I put them behind.

59
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:24,991
Behind? The most behind!

60
00:09:00,011 --> 00:09:02,591
Split the group into two.

61
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:06,591
I'll enter from main door. Find alternative path.
We meet at the gate. Okay?

62
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:14,591
- And Wahyu, you're with me.
- Yes, Sir.

63
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:19,091
Go!

64
00:10:18,011 --> 00:10:23,091
<i>We have commitment, all right? Always
train and perform the best shows..</i>

65
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:26,091
<i>Therefore, Andi and also Anton who...</i>

66
00:10:30,011 --> 00:10:31,591
Take him down.

67
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:52,591
B3 clear.

68
00:10:55,711 --> 00:10:58,591
Let's go! Upstairs now!

69
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:22,091
Silence! Don't move!

70
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:24,591
What the hell?!

71
00:11:25,011 --> 00:11:26,591
I gotta go upstairs.

72
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:30,091
Even you go to fucking sea, I don't care!

73
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:34,591
My wife is alone up there. She needs this medicine.
I gotta go upstairs!

74
00:11:34,811 --> 00:11:35,791
Damn!

75
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:39,591
Step once more, that's gonna be your last!

76
00:11:40,011 --> 00:11:41,591
What the hell?!

77
00:11:41,811 --> 00:11:43,391
That's enough.

78
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:46,091
Bowo, enough!

79
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,091
Wanna be a hero?

80
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:52,091
Go ahead.

81
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:54,991
Don't step any closer!

82
00:11:57,511 --> 00:12:01,091
- What room are you, Sir?
- 726

83
00:12:02,511 --> 00:12:09,010
Relax. I'll take you to your room.
You need to be relax. Until this area is secured.

84
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:11,091
How about my wife up there, then?

85
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,891
I understand. But you need to remain calm.

86
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:16,891
Bullshit!

87
00:12:16,911 --> 00:12:22,391
Listen, you only have 2 options.
With me, or with him.

88
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:25,791
Okay, everyone! We enter now!

89
00:12:26,511 --> 00:12:29,291
You, keep an eye on him!

90
00:12:55,011 --> 00:12:55,791
Huh?

91
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:58,791
Stop him!

92
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:13,291
Clear!

93
00:13:30,211 --> 00:13:31,491
Tie him!

94
00:13:35,211 --> 00:13:36,491
Fuck!

95
00:14:28,504 --> 00:14:30,504
Don't move!

96
00:14:34,514 --> 00:14:36,514
Don't be stupid, boy!

97
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:38,878
Stay where you at!!

98
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:47,094
Good.

99
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:58,359
Now ...

100
00:14:58,787 --> 00:15:00,787
Wait!

101
00:15:15,807 --> 00:15:18,805
Police!

102
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:34,419
- Is that fucking necessary?!
- It is!

103
00:15:35,838 --> 00:15:38,838
Sergeant, we got another one!

104
00:15:39,374 --> 00:15:41,374
Fuck!!

105
00:15:54,502 --> 00:15:56,502
Police!

106
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:01,951
Problem?

107
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:06,021
They're here.

108
00:17:10,214 --> 00:17:14,714
Shut all communications down.
Lock all access down!

109
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:20,132
I wanna ask neighbors to play.

110
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,279
We have visitors. You know what to do.

111
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,390
I'll take the one on the left,
You'll take the one on the right.

112
00:18:08,432 --> 00:18:10,432
Now ...

113
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,125
Hold on! Let him scream.

114
00:18:18,249 --> 00:18:21,245
Outside is secured.

115
00:18:39,249 --> 00:18:40,245
Jono!

116
00:19:15,668 --> 00:19:19,868
This is a football news. Last night. What a game.

117
00:19:19,922 --> 00:19:22,922
I'm a true football fans.

118
00:19:23,072 --> 00:19:25,072
So all games, I..

119
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:58,429
Help! They wanna kill me!

120
00:19:58,692 --> 00:20:01,692
- Stop, don't move!
- Help! They wanna kill me!

121
00:20:01,886 --> 00:20:03,886
Don't move!

122
00:20:11,563 --> 00:20:13,563
Fifth floor is secured.

123
00:20:29,363 --> 00:20:31,106
Let's go get them! Focus!

124
00:20:31,107 --> 00:20:35,003
- We stay in one formation! Be more cautious!
- All right / Okay!
- Lieutenant, you come with me! / Yep!

125
00:20:41,842 --> 00:20:44,742
Rama leave him. Return to formation!

126
00:20:47,316 --> 00:20:51,311
Deer 1, Deer 1. This is Jaka.
Come in.

127
00:20:54,896 --> 00:20:58,896
To anyone who's listening to this.
This is Sergeant Jaka. Come in.

128
00:21:02,004 --> 00:21:04,004
They're dead.

129
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:10,011
Good morning, pals!

130
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:15,559
Maybe you've heard, we got uninvited guests.

131
00:21:16,606 --> 00:21:20,902
It is not me who invite them.
And surely they are not welcomed here.

132
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,065
For the sake of our business..

133
00:21:27,218 --> 00:21:31,218
You may give your help to disinfenct
these fleas.

134
00:21:32,676 --> 00:21:37,676
Then you have your reward to stay for free.

135
00:21:38,543 --> 00:21:43,243
You may meet these uninvited guests
at sixth floor.

136
00:21:44,091 --> 00:21:46,091
Have a nice work!

137
00:21:46,217 --> 00:21:50,717
And don't forget to have fun.

138
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:56,767
Lieutenant, we need backup now.

139
00:21:57,705 --> 00:22:01,374
- We still can handle this.
- With all due respect, Lieutenant.

140
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,675
These bastards are gonna burn us alive,
if we don't do anything.

141
00:22:03,694 --> 00:22:07,473
- We need backup now! / Impossible!
- What the heck with "impossible"?!

142
00:22:07,474 --> 00:22:09,674
This raid is not..

143
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:19,059
Who the hell knows we're here?!

144
00:22:21,178 --> 00:22:23,978
What on earth have you done, Lieutenant?

145
00:22:25,665 --> 00:22:27,665
We're alone.

146
00:22:41,462 --> 00:22:43,462
Sergeant!

147
00:22:46,821 --> 00:22:48,821
Stay here.

148
00:22:49,321 --> 00:22:50,821
Go forward.

149
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,961
Now!

150
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,550
Everyone back off!

151
00:24:19,578 --> 00:24:22,074
Move!

152
00:24:47,134 --> 00:24:49,934
- What the fuck have you done, huh?
- Come here!

153
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,820
See that.

154
00:25:07,364 --> 00:25:10,658
- Are you fucking crazy?
- Watch your mouth!

155
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:13,533
This is my business, I'll take care of it.

156
00:25:14,607 --> 00:25:16,607
Use your brain!

157
00:25:16,901 --> 00:25:19,996
What if they got their backup, huh?

158
00:25:20,068 --> 00:25:23,261
You can't shoot the cops, you buy them!
Done!

159
00:25:23,354 --> 00:25:25,654
You think they come here asking for money?

160
00:25:25,663 --> 00:25:29,663
There won't be any backups.
There won't be any evidences.

161
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:34,645
There's no any diffrence with last takeover.

162
00:25:35,129 --> 00:25:40,129
No shit! We take them all down.

163
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:46,424
- Are you sure?
- I've known the culprit.

164
00:25:47,523 --> 00:25:50,323
Damn this old motherfucker!

165
00:25:50,521 --> 00:25:54,021
How dare he enters my kingdom.

166
00:26:53,284 --> 00:26:56,484
Back off! Everybody back off!
Hangi, break the door!

167
00:27:08,322 --> 00:27:10,329
Clear!

168
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,330
Guard the door!

169
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:30,247
Don't!

170
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,573
Fuck!

171
00:27:39,665 --> 00:27:42,361
Leave this place now!

172
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:04,219
Ari, the axe!

173
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,196
Sergeant!

174
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,900
Come on!

175
00:28:48,673 --> 00:28:50,721
Jaka!

176
00:28:50,722 --> 00:28:52,722
Wait!

177
00:29:21,851 --> 00:29:24,151
They have come.

178
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:43,999


179
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,500
Get me the fuck out of here!

180
00:30:37,874 --> 00:30:39,974
Alee, help!

181
00:30:42,196 --> 00:30:44,196
Dagu!

182
00:31:00,971 --> 00:31:04,571
Get it forward, open fast.
One, two, three.

183
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:15,103
What the fuck is this?

184
00:31:15,184 --> 00:31:17,184
It's a news flash for who we're dealing with.

185
00:31:18,523 --> 00:31:20,523
How bad?

186
00:31:21,307 --> 00:31:25,107
Localized. Only two rooms.

187
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:28,465
Not bad.

188
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:31,866
And about 30 people who rent for us,
die into pieces.

189
00:31:31,989 --> 00:31:33,989
Check the rooms where they stay.

190
00:31:35,324 --> 00:31:37,324
Take their stashes.

191
00:31:37,401 --> 00:31:39,401
All paid.

192
00:31:42,136 --> 00:31:47,136
Get down. Bring your guys.
Clear this shit.

193
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:52,874
Yes, boss.

194
00:35:11,813 --> 00:35:14,313
You take the stairs, I get the elevator.

195
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:18,191
We meet on the seventh floor.
Tomi, Angga, go with him.

196
00:35:18,195 --> 00:35:20,175
No need.

197
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,200
I go along.

198
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:27,082
I go along.

199
00:35:28,529 --> 00:35:30,529
Fine.

200
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:32,929
Okay, come on.

201
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,240
- Where are we going?
- That man before, he was here.

202
00:37:41,253 --> 00:37:43,953
- No, no.
- Relax! We can't out like this.

203
00:37:44,033 --> 00:37:46,727
- Don't you ever leave me there.
- He is not one of them.

204
00:37:46,772 --> 00:37:50,272
That son of a bitch must've torn me apart.
I would haunt you.

205
00:37:50,452 --> 00:37:52,152
Whatever.

206
00:40:02,729 --> 00:40:04,729
Come on!

207
00:40:46,357 --> 00:40:48,357
Up. 2 floors.

208
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,540
Please, open the door!

209
00:41:36,485 --> 00:41:42,180
Please, open the door! We're wounded.
If not, we'll die.

210
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:45,867
Don't open! Don't open!

211
00:42:00,468 --> 00:42:02,468
They're closer.

212
00:42:02,986 --> 00:42:05,786
For the sake of God, look at my face.

213
00:42:05,848 --> 00:42:09,349
Please open the door. Please.

214
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:13,830


215
00:42:30,671 --> 00:42:32,971
Start from there.

216
00:42:35,124 --> 00:42:37,224
Over here.

217
00:42:38,124 --> 00:42:39,724
Keep going.

218
00:42:43,321 --> 00:42:45,321
Wait.

219
00:43:28,954 --> 00:43:30,954
Hey, what's going on?

220
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,375
Shut the fuck up!
You wanna die now?

221
00:43:37,399 --> 00:43:40,399
Check all cupboards, bathroom.

222
00:43:40,454 --> 00:43:43,454
Don't leave anything unswept.

223
00:43:44,084 --> 00:43:47,484
- Hey, what are you hiding?
- Nothing.

224
00:43:48,256 --> 00:43:50,256
Don't you dare lie to me, okay?

225
00:43:50,674 --> 00:43:52,674
I have no time for your lie.

226
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:56,208
All of you make me fed up!

227
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:02,546
When I fed up, I off-control.

228
00:44:03,755 --> 00:44:07,155
- For the sake of Allah, I'm not lying.
- we'll see.

229
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:16,653
What is this?

230
00:45:09,728 --> 00:45:13,028
You are all bastards! Bastards!

231
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,044
You are all bastards!

232
00:45:15,727 --> 00:45:17,727
Go to hell! You're all go to hell!

233
00:45:18,522 --> 00:45:23,927
- Hey, can you shut your damn mouth up, huh?
- Nothing's here. You just destroy all of these!

234
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:27,179
Don't even try lying to me, okay?!

235
00:45:27,779 --> 00:45:30,080
What should I lie for?

236
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:06,861
You want me to slice that bitch up, huh?

237
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:10,360
You want it, huh? Sit down!

238
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:13,430
OK, let's go.

239
00:46:47,855 --> 00:46:51,855
Quick, get a knife or anything sharp.
Quick!

240
00:47:05,419 --> 00:47:08,019
Okay, pretty bad.
I need you to calm down.

241
00:47:08,071 --> 00:47:10,471
I can do it. Don't worry.

242
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,490
Only this.

243
00:47:18,181 --> 00:47:20,881
Get the right one, shit!

244
00:47:20,928 --> 00:47:25,027
I only got this. Or do you need spoon?
Or chop sticks?

245
00:47:32,042 --> 00:47:34,342
Just do it, quick.

246
00:48:15,334 --> 00:48:17,334
What's wrong?

247
00:48:18,394 --> 00:48:20,394
What the hell?!

248
00:49:00,891 --> 00:49:03,091
You must tell me everything about
this place, Sir.

249
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:07,299
Anything that can be used to help
me get him out of here.

250
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:09,486
I wish I could.

251
00:49:09,487 --> 00:49:12,787
Tama gets this place under heavy surveillance.

252
00:49:12,858 --> 00:49:15,058
Even if there was a place out of camera angel,

253
00:49:15,143 --> 00:49:16,647
You'd still trapped in here.

254
00:49:16,767 --> 00:49:18,767
There's no way for escape.

255
00:49:18,797 --> 00:49:22,797
There's no way out. The only one is
your entrance,

256
00:49:23,183 --> 00:49:26,178
with full force.

257
00:49:28,476 --> 00:49:33,249
You must be careful. You're not here
on the humanity mission.

258
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:37,171
Don't be blind. I've seen your boss before.

259
00:49:37,697 --> 00:49:40,697
He knows this building as well as I and others do.

260
00:49:42,506 --> 00:49:44,561
Not every cop can be paid, Sir.

261
00:49:44,562 --> 00:49:47,962
If I didn't believe you,
I wouldn't open the door.

262
00:50:01,945 --> 00:50:03,945
He is stubborn. I don't get him.

263
00:50:05,084 --> 00:50:07,084
But he's a good man.

264
00:50:07,934 --> 00:50:10,734
Take care of him,
I'll be back as soon as I can.

265
00:50:23,934 --> 00:50:26,734
<i>Spare me, please!</i>

266
00:50:48,137 --> 00:50:50,637
Hey, you're too sadistic!

267
00:50:55,931 --> 00:50:57,931
Hey, that's him!

268
00:51:27,106 --> 00:51:29,106
Upstairs!

269
00:52:47,917 --> 00:52:49,917
His legs!

270
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:56,770
Where did this man come from?

271
00:57:03,972 --> 00:57:06,272
Stop! Calm down! Calm down!

272
00:57:11,474 --> 00:57:14,868
What the fuck are you doing here?

273
00:57:26,074 --> 00:57:27,868
Stay here.

274
00:57:49,221 --> 00:57:51,221
They're all dead.

275
00:57:52,837 --> 00:57:54,837
We don't know that for sure.

276
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:01,559
Think about it Jaka, one's a cripple,
the other one is a rookie.

277
00:58:01,926 --> 00:58:03,926
They can't survive.

278
00:58:04,542 --> 00:58:08,542
I don't wanna sacrifice myself,
only for saving their lives.

279
00:58:12,557 --> 00:58:14,600
Listen to me, motherfucker.

280
00:58:14,654 --> 00:58:18,150
When it comes to the lives of my men,
It's better for you to shut the fuck up.

281
00:58:19,067 --> 00:58:21,067
You talk about sacrifice?

282
00:58:21,579 --> 00:58:24,275
That's exactly what they're doing now.

283
00:58:24,725 --> 00:58:26,725
Your life is on my hand.

284
00:58:27,187 --> 00:58:29,687
- Who order this raid?
- What?!

285
00:58:30,156 --> 00:58:32,250
Surely it's not you.

286
00:58:32,251 --> 00:58:35,651
Nobody wants to bath their hands
with dirty work, nobody.

287
00:58:37,516 --> 00:58:39,516
Remember, Jaka.

288
00:58:39,842 --> 00:58:42,826
- What is your rank?
- Rank?

289
00:58:42,827 --> 00:58:46,421
What the hell with rank!
After we get out of here..

290
00:58:46,888 --> 00:58:51,388
You're gonna mop the pee on prison floor,
for the rest of your life.

291
00:58:52,249 --> 00:58:54,749
We're here not on humanity mission.

292
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:59,064
We're here on behalf of someone's business.

293
00:58:59,404 --> 00:59:03,398
Now, who's the culprit beyond all of these?

294
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:10,844
This is not the right time.
This is not the right place.

295
00:59:15,338 --> 00:59:17,338
Whatever.

296
00:59:19,307 --> 00:59:23,799
We're gonna back up there.
We're gonna find our men who survived.

297
00:59:24,582 --> 00:59:26,582
And then we go out of here.

298
00:59:28,752 --> 00:59:31,061
Any objections?

299
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,300
L.i.l.i.y.a.n.a  4  k.u.c.i.n.g._.g.a.u.l

300
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:38,330
Everyone get ready.

301
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:43,193
Go.

302
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:10,187
Protect him! Now!!

303
01:01:39,503 --> 01:01:42,497
Actually, it is not enough.

304
01:01:45,442 --> 01:01:49,435
There's no fun.

305
01:01:50,337 --> 01:01:54,994
Just pull the trigger, you end.

306
01:01:56,042 --> 01:01:58,042
And this ...

307
01:01:59,698 --> 01:02:02,092
This is cool.

308
01:02:03,042 --> 01:02:06,536
This is fun.

309
01:02:07,412 --> 01:02:09,912
This game, is exactly what I like.

310
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,480
You shouldn't be here, Rama.

311
01:05:14,164 --> 01:05:17,658
Nor should you.

312
01:05:22,124 --> 01:05:24,124
Who are they?

313
01:05:29,495 --> 01:05:33,488
No one.

314
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:39,741
Don't you think they have any data, that we..

315
01:05:39,742 --> 01:05:43,868
They don't have any evidence.
Only our first name.

316
01:05:44,218 --> 01:05:46,518
Nobody knows anything about us.

317
01:05:48,992 --> 01:05:52,392
I almost choked when they place
your photo on the board.

318
01:05:52,471 --> 01:05:55,671
Six years without any contact,
and now you come from the middle of nowhere.

319
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:03,570
You have to leave this place.

320
01:06:05,082 --> 01:06:08,779
- Now.
- I can't.

321
01:06:08,935 --> 01:06:12,679
- Not without my friend.
- what? / You heard me.

322
01:06:13,348 --> 01:06:15,542
But you do understand the situation, aren't you?

323
01:06:15,543 --> 01:06:19,143
I do. I'm not the one who lives here.

324
01:06:20,471 --> 01:06:25,267
You're gonna be fine, Rama. Please save your
time if you wanna go here. Just call me.

325
01:06:25,382 --> 01:06:27,882
Oh yeah?
All day I heard my friends..

326
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:29,983
talk about to cut your head off!

327
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:32,060
I can help to get you out of here.

328
01:06:32,309 --> 01:06:34,554
Without get you handcuffed in front of my friends.

329
01:06:34,655 --> 01:06:38,159
What the hell?!
You wanna save me?!

330
01:06:38,238 --> 01:06:40,336
Last time I checked, my friends here are almost done.

331
01:06:40,337 --> 01:06:42,337
But, look at your friends...

332
01:06:42,396 --> 01:06:46,193
- Just fucking do what I ask for!
- And then what? Home?

333
01:06:47,453 --> 01:06:50,375
I am a big disappointment for him.

334
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:56,889
And I'm sure he would be very proud of
who I am now.

335
01:06:58,775 --> 01:07:03,073
Dad just wants you to go home.
We want you to go home.

336
01:07:08,418 --> 01:07:11,367
You don't get it, Rama.

337
01:07:12,582 --> 01:07:15,955
I am who you're looking at right now,
is not who I was.

338
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:19,458
Just because you see what I do is wrong,

339
01:07:19,459 --> 01:07:21,459
does not mean I can not be good at it, Rama.

340
01:07:21,556 --> 01:07:23,556
I paid for my place here.

341
01:07:23,579 --> 01:07:25,579
I am respected here.

342
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:28,540
No, Rama.

343
01:07:29,554 --> 01:07:32,350
I will not go back into what I was.

344
01:07:44,236 --> 01:07:47,630
You're going to be an uncle.

345
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:52,237
What?

346
01:07:53,024 --> 01:07:55,924
Yes, a boy, due in two months.

347
01:08:04,171 --> 01:08:08,771
You tell me this because...
Are you expecting me to leave ....?

348
01:08:08,829 --> 01:08:12,329
- I told you this, because you're my brother!
- Think about what you are doing!

349
01:08:12,496 --> 01:08:15,893
If you choose to stay here, huh?
You sacrifice your life.

350
01:08:15,977 --> 01:08:19,374
- Soon, you'll be a daddy.
- I think about that.

351
01:08:19,426 --> 01:08:22,623
Every goddamn day since I got this assignment.
And that fucking terrifies me!

352
01:08:25,427 --> 01:08:27,427
This is fucking ridiculous! Smart-ass!

353
01:08:35,335 --> 01:08:37,935
You must go, I don't have much time.

354
01:08:38,548 --> 01:08:41,448
At least change your clothing before
you leave.

355
01:08:43,476 --> 01:08:46,076
No, this suits me.

356
01:08:53,883 --> 01:09:00,480
I go first. After the situation is good,
You can go.

357
01:09:19,924 --> 01:09:22,524
Wait! Hold the door.

358
01:09:33,464 --> 01:09:37,347
- Where are your men?
- Still hunting. And yours?

359
01:09:37,622 --> 01:09:39,622
The same.

360
01:09:41,077 --> 01:09:43,477
- Where are you taking him?
- To the Boss.

361
01:09:53,921 --> 01:09:56,121
That's not the guy.

362
01:09:56,122 --> 01:09:58,987
- It is.
- No, definitely isn't.

363
01:09:59,535 --> 01:10:01,535
Plus this guy is already dead.

364
01:10:01,962 --> 01:10:04,362
Well, I'm taking him anyway.

365
01:10:04,914 --> 01:10:07,514
What do you get?

366
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,552
Rama. Get in.

367
01:11:13,865 --> 01:11:17,658
- Where is Bowo?
- He is safe.

368
01:11:18,722 --> 01:11:22,722
We lost the Sergeant. They got him. Die.

369
01:11:24,709 --> 01:11:28,409
That motherfucker dragged him
across the floor like an animal.

370
01:11:28,802 --> 01:11:32,202
What happened? Why did you got split up?

371
01:11:32,649 --> 01:11:35,849
We have fallen in the ambush.
They got in.

372
01:11:35,908 --> 01:11:41,000
And he ran.
Sergeant ordered me to protect him.

373
01:11:43,035 --> 01:11:47,223
Now we can only
try to survive this.

374
01:11:47,531 --> 01:11:49,720
We must get out of here, quick.

375
01:11:49,807 --> 01:11:53,203
You are the cause of every drop of blood
spilled in this place.

376
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:56,238
But now, you don't have any choice.
You must follow us on every step.

377
01:11:56,255 --> 01:12:00,244
Whatever it takes,
until this nightmare is over.

378
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:05,071
- What then?
- we go upstairs. Attack.

379
01:12:05,204 --> 01:12:09,497
We pull out the target, and use him as our
way out of here.

380
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:14,626
- Finding him won't be easy.
- 15th floor.

381
01:12:14,662 --> 01:12:16,662
It's where they control everything.

382
01:12:18,874 --> 01:12:20,874
But it is hard to get there.

383
01:12:21,332 --> 01:12:25,124
And assuming we do get there...
What will you do? Huh? What?

384
01:12:25,144 --> 01:12:28,168
- We force him.
- How?

385
01:12:28,398 --> 01:12:30,883
Man like him should be kneeled.

386
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:33,935
- By what?
- A knife, a chair leg, bare hands, anything.

387
01:12:34,374 --> 01:12:36,471
Do whatever needs to be done to
make him ours.

388
01:12:36,574 --> 01:12:39,562
We still have time to get out.

389
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:48,548
- What is this?
- I told you, that is not the guy.

390
01:12:50,247 --> 01:12:55,139
Yeah. He wears uniform,
and importantly I got something. You?

391
01:12:55,764 --> 01:12:58,752
Isn't it right, Andi?

392
01:12:59,027 --> 01:13:01,107
What do you mean?

393
01:13:03,095 --> 01:13:06,984
Usually you come bringing something.

394
01:13:08,065 --> 01:13:12,562
You're the only one who don't waste my time.

395
01:13:13,285 --> 01:13:15,581
What can I say? I got nothing.

396
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:20,100
Let me see your hands.

397
01:13:23,953 --> 01:13:26,945
- Come here. / What?
- Come here.

398
01:13:38,795 --> 01:13:40,795
Empty.

399
01:13:41,229 --> 01:13:44,726
You must keep something.
Flip them.

400
01:13:45,306 --> 01:13:47,306


401
01:13:56,005 --> 01:14:00,028
I was wrong.
You did waste my fucking time.

402
01:14:03,876 --> 01:14:07,880
- I saw a lot of dead bodies, downstairs.
- Oh yeah? Then?

403
01:14:08,478 --> 01:14:11,478
I think only 20 cops left downstairs.

404
01:14:12,847 --> 01:14:15,747
I think it is 3. What do you think?

405
01:14:15,752 --> 01:14:20,547
Approximately so.
Too many floors to be covered.

406
01:14:21,325 --> 01:14:23,725
Approximately?

407
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:34,575
Listen up, asshole!

408
01:14:34,627 --> 01:14:38,426
I admit you have a gut. I salute it for you.

409
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:42,469
But never underestimate my business.

410
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:48,769
You see that?

411
01:14:50,217 --> 01:14:53,915
After seeing that, I never get my eyes
off the screen.

412
01:14:55,403 --> 01:14:59,303
Looks like only this monitor that
I can trust, asshole!

413
01:15:00,902 --> 01:15:05,301
Only this thing that lets me know everything.

414
01:15:06,096 --> 01:15:08,495
I wanted to ask you..

415
01:15:08,959 --> 01:15:10,959
Why?

416
01:15:11,656 --> 01:15:13,656
You did such a bold move ...

417
01:15:16,539 --> 01:15:19,638
Usually it's not because of the clash of conscience.

418
01:15:20,244 --> 01:15:22,844
Must be something more.

419
01:15:23,565 --> 01:15:26,965
But then I think, "it's useless..".
You're gonna die here anyway.

420
01:15:27,558 --> 01:15:29,558
Why should I ask you "where were you just now?"

421
01:15:31,385 --> 01:15:33,385
But I wanna know..

422
01:15:33,506 --> 01:15:38,506
Who is that dog that bring hurricane
to my kingdom?

423
01:15:39,807 --> 01:15:41,807
And I wanna know his reactions..

424
01:15:44,254 --> 01:15:49,253
If I slaughtered you in front of him..

425
01:15:50,219 --> 01:15:53,119
Or, if I slaughtered him in front of you..

426
01:15:55,666 --> 01:15:58,565
Fuck you!

427
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:16,949
Come on!

428
01:23:39,023 --> 01:23:41,822
Don't move!
Drop your gun!

429
01:23:45,558 --> 01:23:48,058
Why does everything gotta be like this, now?

430
01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:49,970
Get over here!

431
01:23:50,936 --> 01:23:52,936
Quick!

432
01:23:54,538 --> 01:23:57,238
What's wrong, officer?

433
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:59,832
Shut the fuck up! Raise your hands!

434
01:24:04,264 --> 01:24:06,264
Dagu, tie him!

435
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:28,261
Now, get me outta here!

436
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:36,560
Amazing.

437
01:30:07,591 --> 01:30:10,790
What the hell are you doing? Dagu!

438
01:30:10,949 --> 01:30:12,949
He didn't make it.

439
01:30:13,164 --> 01:30:16,164
Fuck you, motherfucker! Why?!

440
01:30:16,552 --> 01:30:19,552
Let it go. This will be over soon.

441
01:30:19,739 --> 01:30:22,439
Soon everything is gonna be fine.

442
01:30:23,068 --> 01:30:24,868
- You can not leave this place!
- Shut up!

443
01:30:25,042 --> 01:30:28,042
Did you think it was easy to sneak around here,
without getting busted?

444
01:30:28,402 --> 01:30:30,402
Did you think I'm that stupid?

445
01:30:30,832 --> 01:30:33,832
I was waiting for you intentionally.
Everyone was.

446
01:30:34,102 --> 01:30:36,102
So, we can get you.

447
01:30:36,482 --> 01:30:39,082
Unfortunately, you didn't make it.

448
01:30:39,151 --> 01:30:44,651
Don't be so sure. Eighteen of your men
are now dead bodies.

449
01:30:44,733 --> 01:30:46,233
Plus your car.

450
01:30:46,543 --> 01:30:48,943
You'd be better to give up.

451
01:30:52,173 --> 01:30:55,172
You only have a few men left.

452
01:30:56,545 --> 01:30:58,545
Mine outnumbers yours, boss.

453
01:30:58,818 --> 01:31:02,818
I only need a single bullet
to blow your skull up!

454
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:06,490
You don't get it, do you?
You're already dead.

455
01:31:07,521 --> 01:31:10,021
You're dead after Reza called me.

456
01:31:13,562 --> 01:31:17,562
What's wrong?
You're shocked? hearing his name? yeah?

457
01:31:18,899 --> 01:31:22,899
Reza and his fancy friends never say "no" to me.

458
01:31:26,165 --> 01:31:30,554
I know what I have to pay,
and how much..

459
01:31:30,793 --> 01:31:34,433
Meanwhile, you can get some discounts from me.

460
01:31:34,743 --> 01:31:37,741
This is not about killing me.

461
01:31:37,742 --> 01:31:41,442
But you were sent here to die, screw you!

462
01:31:42,951 --> 01:31:47,411
- Motherfucker, fuck you!
- Fuck you!

463
01:31:47,570 --> 01:31:51,370
Listen to me! You won't count.

464
01:31:51,433 --> 01:31:54,933
Never!
You can only look above..

465
01:31:55,599 --> 01:31:59,999
Did you think when all of these are over,
you'll got a badge?

466
01:32:00,182 --> 01:32:03,614
Be a hero?!
No, you son of a bitch!

467
01:32:03,769 --> 01:32:06,568
You'll haunted by bullets..

468
01:32:06,569 --> 01:32:10,569
You won't get a wink of sleep,
You got suffocate on your own pillow!

469
01:32:11,218 --> 01:32:14,717
Your career is over.
Just a matter of time.

470
01:32:16,511 --> 01:32:18,511
Fuck you!

471
01:32:19,408 --> 01:32:22,207
Shut up.

472
01:33:35,183 --> 01:33:38,683
<i>My friends, please return to your rooms.</i>

473
01:33:40,359 --> 01:33:42,759
<i>Everything is over.</i>

474
01:33:49,839 --> 01:33:53,338
He actually have known that someone
will dethrone him someday.

475
01:33:53,368 --> 01:33:55,448
Here is the evidence.

476
01:33:55,449 --> 01:33:58,349
It will show you who are in the black list.

477
01:33:59,665 --> 01:34:02,465
Not everyone you know is bad, Rama.

478
01:34:02,623 --> 01:34:04,623
Give it to Bunawar.

479
01:34:04,670 --> 01:34:06,670
He is a good man.

480
01:34:39,070 --> 01:34:41,070
Open the gate!

481
01:34:45,049 --> 01:34:47,049
Keep walking.

482
01:34:47,156 --> 01:34:49,156
Follow me.

483
01:34:50,450 --> 01:34:53,850
I'm sure I can save your life
in this world..

484
01:34:55,315 --> 01:34:57,315
To protect you..

485
01:34:58,124 --> 01:35:01,524
But can you save me out there?

486
01:35:03,001 --> 01:35:08,299
The cops are gonna be here.
They will destroy this place.

487
01:35:08,499 --> 01:35:11,698
We'll be gone before they get here.

488
01:35:14,256 --> 01:35:16,256
Then why do you stay?

489
01:35:16,356 --> 01:35:19,056
For the same reason why
you stayed in that uniform.

490
01:35:21,262 --> 01:35:23,262
Because it fits.
