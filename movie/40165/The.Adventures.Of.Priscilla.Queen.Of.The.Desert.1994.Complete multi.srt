to tell my parents

what a wonderful childhood I'd had.

791
01:08:03,539 --> 01:08:07,668
They never spoke to me again
after I'd had the chop.

792
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:15,509

- Spread his legs.
- No, please.

800
01:08:50,586 --> 01:08:53,714
Stop! What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

801

will be much more impressed

and fuck a couple of pigs on the bar.

I suppose you wanna fuck, too, do you?

Come on, Bernadette.
Come and fuck me. That's it.

it takes care of us.

stop them getting in or us getting out.

- No worries, mate.

all the way to Alice?

No good. He says the man to help us
is a fair way out of town.

- Because he's not out here.

There's one thing I'd like to do to you,

I've got a good mind
to put you over my knee.

- I'll spank, spank you back.

For Christ sake, Mitz,
why didn't you tell us?

01:19:00,987 --> 01:19:03,240
Why the hell did you have to
shock me like that?

I think you look more
like a Disney witch, myself.

962
01:19:17,128 --> 01:19:19,756
Oh, shut your face, Felicia.
At least I don't look like

963
01:19:19,923 --> 01:19:21,841

a can of beans with my face.

964

I'm sorry, girls.

965
01:19:23,093 --> 01:19:25,428
I couldn't stand the thought of you
bagging me on the bus for two weeks.

966
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:27,347
Anyway, what difference
does it make now?

967
01:19:27,514 --> 01:19:29,516
About two inches to my head, for one.

968
01:19:29,683 --> 01:19:32,185
Did you get a good look at him?
He's got my profile, that's for sure.

969
01:19:32,352 --> 01:19:33,228
I think I'm gonna be sick.

970
01:19:33,395 --> 01:19:36,356
I hate to be practical here,
but does he know who you are?

971
01:19:36,523 --> 01:19:38,191
I mean, does he know
what you do for a living?

972
01:19:38,358 --> 01:19:42,529
He knows he has a father in the
show business, cosmetics industry.

Oh, Lord. I don't understand.

No, you don't understand,
so stop trying to.

hide in there, have you?

BOB: Cat.

1091
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:32,201
Famous woman.

1092
01:29:34,537 --> 01:29:35,788
MARION: Baby.
FELICIA: Rocking.

1093
01:29:36,122 --> 01:29:37,623
MARION: I know this one.

1094
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:40,293
- BOB: Race horse.
- FELICIA: Cat. Scary cat.

1095
01:29:40,459 --> 01:29:41,961
Scary moose.

1096
01:29:42,461 --> 01:29:43,796
- Scary dog.
- BOB: I know, I know.

1097
01:29:43,963 --> 01:29:45,256
FELICIA: N0?

1098
01:29:46,007 --> 01:29:47,383
BERNADETTE: Lindy Chamberlain.

1099
01:29:49,176 --> 01:29:51,512
That was appalling, Benji.
Who taught you that?

1100
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:53,806
- Mum did.
- MARION: Lies, all lies.

1101
01:29:55,766 --> 01:29:59,145
Come on, Adam. Up.

1102
01:30:00,146 --> 01:30:03,816
Time is against us,
and we have things to do.

1103
01:30:06,652 --> 01:30:10,156
- Come on, you butch thing, you.
- No, count me out.

1104
01:30:10,907 --> 01:30:12,533
- All for one.
- FELICIA: Come on, Tick.

1105
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:13,868
No.

1106
01:30:17,788 --> 01:30:20,124
BERNADETTE: Come on, Adam,
let's get frocked.

1107
01:30:26,672 --> 01:30:28,090
So...

1108
01:30:29,175 --> 01:30:32,303
What's it like to finally have a father?

1109
01:30:32,845 --> 01:30:34,513
It's okay.

1110
01:30:39,518 --> 01:30:41,145
Sorry about last night.

1111
01:30:41,312 --> 01:30:43,648
I don't always dress up
in women's clothes.

1112
01:30:43,814 --> 01:30:46,525
I mean, you know,
don't get the wrong idea.

1113
01:30:49,904 --> 01:30:51,697
I mean, I do a lot of
different stuff, you know,

1114
01:30:51,864 --> 01:30:56,994
like Elvis and Gary Glitter.

1115
01:30:57,161 --> 01:30:58,663
ABBA?

1116
01:31:02,291 --> 01:31:05,127
I'm not supposed to know
about the ABBA show,

1117
01:31:05,294 --> 01:31:07,004
but I'd really like to see it.

1118
01:31:07,964 --> 01:31:10,216
Would you do ABBA for me?

1119
01:31:11,842 --> 01:31:13,052
Sure.

1120
01:31:18,891 --> 01:31:20,601
You know what I am, don't you?

1121
01:31:22,269 --> 01:31:24,146
Mum says you're
the best in the business.

1122
01:31:26,524 --> 01:31:29,193
Well, your mother was always
prone to exaggeration.

1123
01:31:33,239 --> 01:31:36,534
Will you have a boyfriend
when we get back to Sydney?

1124
01:31:40,705 --> 01:31:42,206
Maybe.

1125
01:31:44,125 --> 01:31:45,626
That's good.

1126
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:59,598
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

1127
01:31:59,765 --> 01:32:02,143
We're gonna unleash
the best in the business.

1128
01:32:10,359 --> 01:32:11,819
I had a dream.

1129
01:33:50,584 --> 01:33:53,546
MITZI: Well, We did it.

1130
01:33:55,589 --> 01:33:57,091
It never ends, does it?

1131
01:33:57,716 --> 01:33:59,385
All that space.

1132
01:34:05,057 --> 01:34:06,267
So what now?

1133
01:34:07,643 --> 01:34:09,645
I think I wanna go home.

1134
01:34:12,022 --> 01:34:13,274
Me, too.

1135
01:34:15,359 --> 01:34:20,239
Well, then, let's finish
the shows and go home.

1136
01:34:35,504 --> 01:34:37,339
Hey, don't go without leaving me
your number, sunshine.

1137
01:34:37,506 --> 01:34:38,799
Already taken care of, Jeff.

1138
01:34:38,966 --> 01:34:40,843
It's at the far end
of the men's cubicle.

1139
01:34:41,010 --> 01:34:42,761
"For a good time, phone Felicia."

1140
01:34:42,928 --> 01:34:45,347
Hey, can we stop at McDonald's
on the way back?

1141
01:34:45,514 --> 01:34:46,432
That's a good idea.

1142
01:34:46,599 --> 01:34:48,100
I've had just about enough of
this shitty food. Fucking crawfish.

1143
01:34:48,267 --> 01:34:49,852
I don't know.
Where the hell do you start?

1144
01:34:50,019 --> 01:34:52,938
Stop it. Lay it on the line, husband.
Don't conceal a thing.

1145
01:34:53,105 --> 01:34:55,524
That's the key. And if he doesn't
like it, stiff bikkies.

1146
01:34:55,691 --> 01:34:56,942
He can always buy his own ticket back.

1147
01:34:57,109 --> 01:34:59,320
What happens when word gets out
that Mitzi's got a minor?

1148
01:34:59,486 --> 01:35:02,114
That's your problem, not his.
He knows when and where to listen.

1149
01:35:02,281 --> 01:35:03,991
Morals are a choice,
and he'll decide his own

1150
01:35:04,158 --> 01:35:05,868
when he's good and bloody well ready.

1151
01:35:06,035 --> 01:35:08,287
Well, that's it. You're all packed.

1152
01:35:08,454 --> 01:35:09,580
Gotta be joking.

1153
01:35:09,747 --> 01:35:12,666
We haven't got Bernadette's shoes
up on board yet.

1154
01:35:12,833 --> 01:35:15,169
I hate to say this.
Wish I was going with you.

1155
01:35:15,336 --> 01:35:19,131
Your gas tank will be fine.
Your axle may be another matter.

1156
01:35:19,298 --> 01:35:21,592
I'm sure the road home
will just be filled with bored mechanics

1157
01:35:21,759 --> 01:35:24,261
waiting for a bus full of drag queens
to spirit them away to a better life.

1158
01:35:24,428 --> 01:35:27,097
I wish. We're not even gonna
spirit gum at this rate.

1159
01:35:27,264 --> 01:35:29,350
- Where the hell's Bernadette?
- Here.

1160
01:35:31,435 --> 01:35:34,897
Come on, Cabanossi tits.
Where are your bags?

1161
01:35:35,064 --> 01:35:36,565
BERNADETTE: In my room.

1162
01:35:38,317 --> 01:35:41,153
I'm not going.
I've decided to stay here for a while.

1163
01:35:42,154 --> 01:35:44,990
Oh, really? And you're choosing
to tell us about this now?

1164
01:35:45,824 --> 01:35:48,535
She told me a few weeks back.
Just when I was looking for somebody

1165
01:35:48,702 --> 01:35:50,704
to handle the guest entertainment
while I'm away.

1166
01:35:50,871 --> 01:35:51,830
Oh, I get it.

1167
01:35:51,997 --> 01:35:54,833
Who's been playing
hide the sausage, then?

1168
01:35:56,210 --> 01:35:58,337
That's it.
Let's get out of here before I throw up.

1169
01:35:58,504 --> 01:35:59,672
Come on, Benj.

1170
01:36:01,173 --> 01:36:03,133

No, I'm not sure.

1174
01:36:15,729 --> 01:36:18,065
But I'll never know
unless I give it a shot.

BENJI: Bye-bye.
