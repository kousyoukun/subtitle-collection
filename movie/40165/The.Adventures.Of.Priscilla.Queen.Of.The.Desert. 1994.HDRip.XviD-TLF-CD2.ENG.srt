00:00:25,303 --> 00:00:27,388
What the hell is going on?

3
00:00:52,288 --> 00:00:54,290
Oh, she's not!

4
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:55,833
Is she?

5
00:00:57,627 --> 00:01:00,630
Oh, you can't do that
with a ping-pong ball!

6
00:01:02,882 --> 00:01:04,592
Do you want a bet?

7
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,846
Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh!

8
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:36,913
Help me!

9
00:01:36,948 --> 00:01:39,492
He's taking me away! Help me!

10
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,799
I'm going!

11
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:50,253
Darling, there's nothing
we can't work out.

12
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:53,273
You no good man.
Now, don't be silly.

13
00:01:53,308 --> 00:01:56,259
You want good wife -
you be good husband.

14
00:01:56,294 --> 00:01:58,268
Darling, don't go.

15
00:01:58,303 --> 00:02:02,057
I no like you anyway.
You got little ding-a-ling.

16
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:20,200
Some days you just shouldn't
get out of bed.

17
00:02:20,235 --> 00:02:22,636
In my opinion, you should wait here

18
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:25,003
for the new gas tank
from Coober Pedy.

19
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:28,729
Then again,
you listened to my last opinion.

20
00:02:28,764 --> 00:02:31,614
Forget it, Bob.
It's time we made a move.

21
00:02:31,649 --> 00:02:34,429
I'm just a gifted amateur
around here.

22
00:02:34,464 --> 00:02:37,349
There's no way a nice frock
and a catchy tune

23
00:02:37,384 --> 00:02:41,450
can compete with three ping-pong
balls, two cigarettes and beer.

24
00:02:41,485 --> 00:02:45,517
I'll play it safe and stick
to the main drag, pardon the pun.

25
00:02:45,552 --> 00:02:47,025
Well, goodbye, Bob.

26
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,110
Thanks for a very educational stay.

27
00:02:49,145 --> 00:02:52,607
I'd love to be able
to open a bottle like that.

28
00:02:52,642 --> 00:02:54,401
Bernadette,
it's certainly been an honour

29
00:02:54,436 --> 00:02:56,326
meeting a member of Les Girls.

30
00:02:56,361 --> 00:02:59,454
And it's been an honour
to meet a gentleman.

31
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:04,035
Believe me, Bob, these days
gentlemen are an endangered species.

32
00:03:06,746 --> 00:03:11,126
Unlike bloody drag queens
who just keep breeding like rabbits!

33
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,385
Oh, fuck it!

34
00:03:21,428 --> 00:03:25,640
Bob! Fancy a free ride
to Coober Pedy?

35
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:34,114
Now, listen, Bob.
Let's get one thing straight.

36
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:38,319
We wear the frocks, but that
doesn't mean you wear the pants.

37
00:03:38,354 --> 00:03:39,995
Right. Where do I sleep?

38
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,282
Oh! Anywhere that takes your fancy!

39
00:03:42,317 --> 00:03:44,534
The roof will do me fine.

40
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:47,544
Thank you, Bob.

41
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:49,629
I don't know what to say.

42
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:54,294
That's alright. Might as well get
there earlier. Bit of R and R.

43
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:56,504
God knows I need it.

44
00:04:20,403 --> 00:04:24,366
Can I ask you a personal question,
if you don't mind?

45
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:26,916
Sure.
Why?

46
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:30,163
Why do you... you know?

47
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,216
You mean the $64,000 question?

48
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:38,345
That's the girl.
Don't tear the wrapping paper.

49
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,218
Just slide the ribbon off and we can
see what Santa's brought you.

50
00:04:43,253 --> 00:04:44,803
Here it comes now.

51
00:04:44,838 --> 00:04:46,680
What is it?

52
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:49,557
Oh, it's a... It's a...

53
00:04:51,768 --> 00:04:53,853
...cement mixer.

54
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:59,901
Have you been changing the cards
around again, Ralph?

55
00:05:03,446 --> 00:05:06,873
So, I guess I had no choice
in the matter.

56
00:05:06,908 --> 00:05:10,203
For fuck's sake! Watch where
you're driving, you stupid bitch!

57
00:05:10,238 --> 00:05:12,080
You trying to fucken kill me?

58
00:05:12,115 --> 00:05:13,588
My fault!

59
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:16,001
Sorry, Bob.
I thought it was Bernadette.

60
00:05:19,254 --> 00:05:23,174
One-two-three, two-two-three,
three-two-three...

61
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:24,849
Now you're getting it.

62
00:05:24,884 --> 00:05:27,220
Who taught you to waltz?
My wife.

63
00:05:27,255 --> 00:05:28,728
Oh, how sweet.

64
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:31,975
You and the missus down at
Arthur Murray's every Tuesday

65
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,806
practising your hearts out.

66
00:05:33,841 --> 00:05:35,603
Makes me want to sick up.

67
00:05:35,638 --> 00:05:37,112
Married?

68
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:38,863
Yes, married.

69
00:05:38,898 --> 00:05:40,490
We've only recently discovered

70
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:42,944
young Anthony here
bats for both teams.

71
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:45,739
I do not!
Oh, so we're straight?

72
00:05:45,774 --> 00:05:47,414
No.
Oh, we're not?

73
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:49,200
We're a donut puncher after all?

74
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:51,376
No.
Then what are we?

75
00:05:51,411 --> 00:05:53,246
I don't fucking know!

76
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:56,875
What the fuck's that?

77
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,806
Good evening.

78
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:06,593
Nice night for it.

79
00:06:07,886 --> 00:06:09,596
Oh, OK. Goodnight then.

80
00:06:10,722 --> 00:06:12,432
What a rude woman.

81
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:26,529
And that's the power steering pump.
And that's the radiator fan.

82
00:06:26,564 --> 00:06:28,413
How interesting.
Simple.

83
00:06:28,448 --> 00:06:31,868
That's the rubber band
that drives the whole thing...

84
00:06:31,903 --> 00:06:34,704
Oh! Yes!

85
00:06:36,164 --> 00:06:38,708
Hey! Who wants first bath?

86
00:06:38,743 --> 00:06:40,377
Whoo-ooh!

87
00:06:54,474 --> 00:06:56,017
I won!

88
00:07:06,695 --> 00:07:08,405
Can I help you, ma'am?

89
00:07:18,248 --> 00:07:20,083
OK! Turn her over!

90
00:07:38,476 --> 00:07:41,625
I don't care
if the sun don't shine

91
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,774
I get my loving in the evening time

92
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:49,202
When I'm with my baby

93
00:07:49,237 --> 00:07:51,997
It's no fun with the sun around

94
00:07:52,032 --> 00:07:55,160
But I get going
when the sun goes down

95
00:07:55,195 --> 00:07:59,379
And I meet my baby

96
00:07:59,414 --> 00:08:02,876
That's when we kiss
and kiss and kiss

97
00:08:02,911 --> 00:08:05,010
And then we kiss some more

98
00:08:05,045 --> 00:08:08,305
Don't ask how many times we kiss

99
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,301
At a time like this
who keeps score?

100
00:08:11,336 --> 00:08:14,262
So, I don't care
if the sun don't shine

101
00:08:14,297 --> 00:08:17,015
I get my loving in the evening time

102
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,227
When I'm with my baby!

103
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,049
That's it over there.

104
00:08:44,084 --> 00:08:47,212
It's an OK room - with a shower.
Bags first!

105
00:08:47,247 --> 00:08:49,596
Is hot water all you think about?

106
00:08:49,631 --> 00:08:53,141
No. A shower, bed
and nice meal will do fine.

107
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:56,471
If you think I'm just going to
watch television, you're wrong.

108
00:08:56,506 --> 00:08:58,807
Now, look.
You blokes watch your back.

109
00:08:58,842 --> 00:09:00,482
It's a pretty tough town.

110
00:09:00,517 --> 00:09:04,312
They go down holes, blow things up,
then come up again.

111
00:09:04,347 --> 00:09:06,363
That sums things up.
Oh, fabulous!

112
00:09:06,398 --> 00:09:09,199
You're welcome to hang out
with us, Bob.

113
00:09:09,234 --> 00:09:13,738
I'm meeting some of the boys
in the old drive-in for a booze-up.

114
00:09:13,773 --> 00:09:15,246
Like the old days.

115
00:09:15,281 --> 00:09:17,582
I want to go to the boys club!

116
00:09:17,617 --> 00:09:22,372
You'll have supper with us
or stay in your room and watch TV.

117
00:09:47,605 --> 00:09:49,155
Ha!

118
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,401
He's a good man, our Bob.

119
00:09:52,444 --> 00:09:54,411
Yeah.

120
00:09:54,446 --> 00:09:56,329
Not my type, though.

121
00:09:56,364 --> 00:09:59,332
Oh! Don't come the raw prawn with me!

122
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:02,871
I can spot the fluttering
of a beaded lash from 300 paces!

123
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:05,874
Oh, get out! He's far too old.

124
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:10,003
Mind you, so am I.
Mmm.

125
00:10:11,046 --> 00:10:13,465
Did you catch that mail-order bride?

126
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,510
Why'd he marry? I'm dying to ask.

127
00:10:19,054 --> 00:10:22,265
Oops! Sorry.
It's alright.

128
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,940
Don't worry about it.

129
00:10:23,975 --> 00:10:26,776
You're the world's best husband.

130
00:10:26,811 --> 00:10:30,357
And, given the chance,
a perfectly good father too.

131
00:10:31,858 --> 00:10:33,616
Do you really think so?

132
00:10:33,651 --> 00:10:36,029
Why? Thinking about children?

133
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,324
Yes, as a matter of fact.

134
00:10:55,924 --> 00:10:59,844
Um, do you have
'The Texas Chainsaw Mascara'?

135
00:11:03,765 --> 00:11:05,273
You ever wanted kids?

136
00:11:05,308 --> 00:11:08,978
Sure. But I've learned
not to think about it.

137
00:11:12,691 --> 00:11:16,027
You think an old queen's
capable of raising a child?

138
00:11:16,062 --> 00:11:18,988
Well, Elizabeth did
a pretty good job.

139
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:21,717
Prince Charles is a wonderful boy.

140
00:11:21,752 --> 00:11:24,411
Edward's still a bit of a worry.

141
00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:29,561
What happens
if they turn out like Adam?

142
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:32,836
You stuff them back in
and ask for a refund.

143
00:11:36,047 --> 00:11:37,590
Stupid little shit.

144
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:41,302
I dread to think what he's up to.

145
00:12:06,578 --> 00:12:08,455
Oooh.

146
00:12:09,622 --> 00:12:11,131
Hello.

147
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,335
I'm new in town.

148
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:16,803
No kidding.

149
00:12:16,838 --> 00:12:19,945
Could I have a bloody Mary, please?

150
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,053
It's a beer or nothing... sweetheart.

151
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:26,514
Well, I'd better have a beer then.

152
00:12:27,932 --> 00:12:29,476
Cheers.

153
00:12:33,605 --> 00:12:35,690
What are you all looking at?

154
00:12:38,818 --> 00:12:40,362
I'm sorry.

155
00:12:41,613 --> 00:12:45,950
Didn't mean to stare.
We don't usually get women down here.

156
00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:47,459
Oh.

157
00:12:47,494 --> 00:12:52,874
So what do women do around here
besides watching videos?

158
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:57,837
Well, well, well!
Look who we have here.

159
00:12:59,714 --> 00:13:01,633
You know that bloke, do you?

160
00:13:06,596 --> 00:13:08,139
No.

161
00:13:09,182 --> 00:13:12,977
So... who's going to show me
the sights?

162
00:13:14,437 --> 00:13:16,189
It'd be my pleasure.

163
00:13:17,232 --> 00:13:18,775
Oh.

164
00:13:21,695 --> 00:13:23,238
So, how about it?

165
00:13:25,615 --> 00:13:28,743
I suppose a fuck's
now out of the question.

166
00:13:33,456 --> 00:13:36,584
Get her, Frank!
Go, Frank!

167
00:13:38,545 --> 00:13:42,340
Come on, boys! Who wants to see
my map of Tasmania?

168
00:13:43,508 --> 00:13:48,013
I never got to tell my parents
what a wonderful childhood I'd had.

169
00:13:50,682 --> 00:13:54,894
They never spoke to me again
after I'd had... the chop.

170
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:03,006
I think I have something
to tell you.

171
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,037
Oh, shit.

172
00:14:06,072 --> 00:14:08,450
Get after her!

173
00:14:20,545 --> 00:14:23,673
OK, fellas!
Don't forget how to treat a lady.

174
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,216
You fucking freak!

175
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,270
Hold him down.

176
00:14:30,305 --> 00:14:32,036
Spread his legs apart.

177
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,767
Oh, no. Please, don't!

178
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:37,902
Frank, stop!

179
00:14:37,937 --> 00:14:40,940
Stop! What the fuck
do you think you're doing?!

180
00:14:40,975 --> 00:14:43,360
You mean you do know
this cocksucker.

181
00:14:43,395 --> 00:14:44,993
Get off him, you mongrel!

182
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:49,115
He was joking, OK?
You leave the little bugger alone.

183
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,825
Get out of there, Bob.

184
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,375
Calm down, Frank.

185
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:56,206
Put the faggot down and get out
or you'll be next.

186
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:58,048
Frank!
Get out of there!

187
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:02,128
Stop flexing your muscles
you big pile of budgie turd.

188
00:15:02,163 --> 00:15:04,179
Your mates will be more impressed

189
00:15:04,214 --> 00:15:08,718
if you go back to the pub
and fuck a few pigs on the bar.

190
00:15:08,753 --> 00:15:10,345
Bernadette, please...

191
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,437
Bernadette?!

192
00:15:12,472 --> 00:15:16,226
Well, I'll be darned.
The whole circus is in town.

193
00:15:16,261 --> 00:15:19,017
I suppose you want a fuck too,
do you?

194
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:21,773
Come on, Bernadette.
Come and fuck me.

195
00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:23,316
That's it.

196
00:15:24,526 --> 00:15:27,118
Come on. Come and fuck me.

197
00:15:27,153 --> 00:15:29,343
Come on.

198
00:15:29,378 --> 00:15:31,533
Fuck me.

199
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:40,006
There, now you're fucked.

200
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:43,899
You stupid bloody idiot!
Drugs, for Christ's sake!

201
00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:47,757
Well, three cheers for you!
I hope you're happy now!

202
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,844
You bloody fuckwit!

203
00:15:54,848 --> 00:15:56,391
It's funny.

204
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,109
We all sit around

205
00:15:59,144 --> 00:16:02,814
mindlessly slagging off
that vile stink-hole of a city.

206
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:08,576
But in its own strange way
it takes care of us.

207
00:16:08,611 --> 00:16:12,782
I don't know if that ugly wall
of suburbia's been put there

208
00:16:12,817 --> 00:16:16,411
to stop them getting in
or us getting out.

209
00:16:20,081 --> 00:16:21,624
Come on.

210
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:25,462
Don't let it drag you down.

211
00:16:25,497 --> 00:16:27,172
Let it toughen you up.

212
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,343
I can only fight
because I've learnt to.

213
00:16:32,635 --> 00:16:36,556
Being a man one day
and a woman the next isn't easy.

214
00:16:40,518 --> 00:16:42,395
Sorry. Can't help you.
No worries, Pete.

215
00:16:46,024 --> 00:16:49,319
Are we bunny-hopping
all the way to Alice?

216
00:16:49,354 --> 00:16:52,614
The man to help's
a fair way out of town.

217
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:54,247
Like how fair?

218
00:16:54,282 --> 00:16:55,957
Couple of hundred klicks fair.

219
00:16:55,992 --> 00:17:00,372
No matter. I've go nothing else
to do today. Let's get out of here.

220
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:02,457
Come on, Adam. We're not here.

221
00:17:08,046 --> 00:17:15,560
A fine romance
with no kisses

222
00:17:15,595 --> 00:17:22,644
A fine romance,
my friend, this is

223
00:17:23,687 --> 00:17:28,191
We should be like
a couple of hot tomatoes...

224
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:34,781
Some things are said
in the heat of the moment.

225
00:17:37,742 --> 00:17:40,912
I'm sorry I got angry with you
last night.

226
00:17:40,947 --> 00:17:43,390
Oh, I dare say you deserved it.

227
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:45,834
Anyway, that's enough of that.

228
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,256
This is quite an experience
sitting with you now.

229
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,931
I can quite safely say

230
00:17:52,966 --> 00:17:57,053
that I think your taste in clothing
is absolutely terrible

231
00:17:57,088 --> 00:17:59,347
because you can't say a word,
can you?

232
00:18:00,932 --> 00:18:03,601
Oh, this is great fun!

233
00:18:06,938 --> 00:18:10,483
We're going to have a problem
finding this guy with the tank.

234
00:18:10,518 --> 00:18:13,236
Why say that?
Because he's not out here.

235
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:15,655
He's out here. He's in Alice.

236
00:18:16,698 --> 00:18:19,582
I can't go back to Coober Pedy
for a while.

237
00:18:19,617 --> 00:18:22,746
I'm not the most popular bloke
back there anymore.

238
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:29,336
Ooof!

239
00:18:35,508 --> 00:18:37,468
Hello.

240
00:18:37,503 --> 00:18:39,394
Hello!

241
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:42,390
Who are you?
I your wife!

242
00:18:45,393 --> 00:18:48,438
Guess I'll be going home then.
You no going!

243
00:18:48,473 --> 00:18:50,857
I coming too. I your wife!

244
00:18:50,892 --> 00:18:53,360
See? I your wife!

245
00:18:53,395 --> 00:18:55,493
Silly girl.

246
00:18:55,528 --> 00:18:57,871
Should've done her homework better.

247
00:18:57,906 --> 00:19:01,701
She always thought...
She thought I was from Sydney.

248
00:19:01,736 --> 00:19:04,371
Why did you bring her home?

249
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:06,254
She was me wife.

250
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:08,340
Couldn't you sell her off?

251
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,919
Oh, the party's over, everyone.
It talks.

252
00:19:10,954 --> 00:19:13,511
Can't keep a good bitch down.

253
00:19:13,546 --> 00:19:16,007
What time
will we be in Alice Springs?

254
00:19:17,342 --> 00:19:18,850
Late tomorrow arvo.

255
00:19:18,885 --> 00:19:20,970
How long will you be staying?

256
00:19:21,005 --> 00:19:22,479
Don't know.

257
00:19:22,514 --> 00:19:24,224
A couple of days maybe.

258
00:19:25,266 --> 00:19:29,062
A big day for you tomorrow!
We'll all meet the missus!

259
00:19:29,097 --> 00:19:30,772
I saw that smile, Felicia!

260
00:19:30,807 --> 00:19:32,280
One derogatory word

261
00:19:32,315 --> 00:19:35,610
and I'll take you back
to your mate in Coober Pedy.

262
00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:39,781
Please, everyone.
Tomorrow will be tough.

263
00:19:39,816 --> 00:19:41,873
Please don't make it any harder.

264
00:19:41,908 --> 00:19:46,413
We're only teasing. We won't open
our mouths until you give the word.

265
00:19:46,448 --> 00:19:48,123
And then it's open season.

266
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,187
Oh, well. Time for bed.

267
00:20:04,222 --> 00:20:06,606
Got to look good for the wife.

268
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:09,269
Come along, Adam.
Time for your beauty sleep.

269
00:20:09,304 --> 00:20:11,403
Come on!

270
00:20:11,438 --> 00:20:13,523
Will you two be joining us?

271
00:20:14,566 --> 00:20:17,694
I just thought
I'd have one for the road.

272
00:20:17,729 --> 00:20:19,275
How about you, Bob?

273
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,787
Sounds good to me.

274
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:23,366
Alright, then.
See you in the morning.

275
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:24,909
Goodnight!

276
00:20:26,745 --> 00:20:28,830
Another piece of cake, Bob?

277
00:20:28,865 --> 00:20:31,583
Ah, no.
Oh.

278
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:39,507
So... tell me about you.

279
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:43,310
Can't complain.

280
00:20:43,345 --> 00:20:45,061
Life's a lot simpler now.

281
00:20:45,096 --> 00:20:47,564
Spent 30 years
wandering around the world

282
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,686
only to find I was better off
where I started.

283
00:20:53,271 --> 00:20:55,357
Not much, but it's my turf.

284
00:20:55,392 --> 00:20:57,067
Oooh! Shit!

285
00:21:11,498 --> 00:21:13,041
Adam!

286
00:21:15,001 --> 00:21:17,177
Adam!

287
00:21:17,212 --> 00:21:19,798
What?
Guess who didn't come home?

288
00:21:27,347 --> 00:21:30,482
I've waited all my life for this.

289
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:34,270
Bernice has left her cake
out in the rain!

290
00:21:39,442 --> 00:21:43,405
Hava nagila
Have a hangover

291
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,449
Hava nagila
Hi hi hi!

292
00:21:48,284 --> 00:21:51,788
Di di, di-di-di-di
Di di, di-di-di-di

293
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:58,009
Hava nagila
Hava nagila

294
00:21:58,044 --> 00:22:01,589
Hava nagila
V'nish m'cha, hey!

295
00:22:01,624 --> 00:22:04,922
Hava nagila
Hava nagila

296
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:08,186
Hava nagila
V'nish m'cha

297
00:22:08,221 --> 00:22:15,395
Aaaahhhhhh, aaaahhhhhh,
aaaahhhhhh HEY!

298
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,689
My fucking back's killing me.

299
00:22:17,724 --> 00:22:19,698
I need a crap.

300
00:22:19,733 --> 00:22:22,861
Do you want me to go in?
I'll go.

301
00:22:24,154 --> 00:22:27,205
Excuse me.
You can't park your bus here.

302
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,993
Are you planning on staying here?
I'm sorry...

303
00:22:30,028 --> 00:22:32,262
Could you direct me to Marian Barber?

304
00:22:32,297 --> 00:22:34,462
We're the cabaret act from Sydney.

305
00:22:34,497 --> 00:22:37,375
Oh, right, right!
Just go through to reception.

306
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,883
Thanks.
No worries.

307
00:22:38,918 --> 00:22:41,338
It's alright, Lenny.
It's the drag queens!

308
00:22:43,423 --> 00:22:47,177
Come on, Bob. Let's go try on
your new frock.

309
00:22:47,212 --> 00:22:48,720
G'day.

310
00:22:50,722 --> 00:22:52,807
Just over there by the bar.

311
00:22:52,842 --> 00:22:54,351
Thanks.

312
00:22:59,689 --> 00:23:02,532
No, those three kegs
didn't arrive.

313
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:05,278
I need them today -
not tomorrow, but today.

314
00:23:05,313 --> 00:23:06,839
You're a doll.

315
00:23:06,874 --> 00:23:08,365
What an arsehole.

316
00:23:12,494 --> 00:23:14,919
Oh, my God! Husband! Husband!

317
00:23:14,954 --> 00:23:17,672
It's so good to see you!
Hiya, wife!

318
00:23:17,707 --> 00:23:20,689
You're late. Where are the others?
Oh, they're outside.

319
00:23:20,724 --> 00:23:23,637
You've lost weight, you old queer.
About fucken time!

320
00:23:23,672 --> 00:23:27,842
I can fit into your old one-piece -
the one with the sunflowers.

321
00:23:27,877 --> 00:23:29,893
What do you do with it?

322
00:23:29,928 --> 00:23:33,390
'The Poseidon Adventure' routine.
You know, Shelley Winters.

323
00:23:39,437 --> 00:23:41,022
Where is he?

324
00:23:48,154 --> 00:23:51,700
I'd like to give you
a good spanking.

325
00:23:51,735 --> 00:23:53,458
You can get it!

326
00:23:53,493 --> 00:23:55,502
Spank, spank, spank!

327
00:23:55,537 --> 00:23:58,046
I'll put you over my knee.

328
00:23:58,081 --> 00:24:00,417
I'll "spank, spank" you back!
Oops!

329
00:24:00,452 --> 00:24:01,960
Benj.

330
00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:04,838
Do you remember Tick?

331
00:24:12,387 --> 00:24:14,055
Hello, Tick.

332
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:20,478
Hello.

333
00:24:23,231 --> 00:24:24,899
Where's the bloody bar?

334
00:24:28,987 --> 00:24:30,947
Mr Belrose?

335
00:24:30,982 --> 00:24:32,789
Yes?

336
00:24:32,824 --> 00:24:35,618
Congratulations. It's a boy.

337
00:24:39,122 --> 00:24:40,707
Oh!

338
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,550
Shit!
Are you OK?

339
00:24:43,585 --> 00:24:45,844
What's the matter? Oh, my God!
Help.

340
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:48,256
Christ's sake, Mitz,
why didn't you tell us?

341
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,675
Why did you shock me like that?

342
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,183
Ooh!

343
00:24:52,218 --> 00:24:55,347
This lump on my head's
growing by the second.

344
00:24:55,382 --> 00:24:57,397
I'm making
my Northern Territory debut

345
00:24:57,432 --> 00:25:00,143
looking like a fucking
Warner Bros cartoon character

346
00:25:00,178 --> 00:25:02,193
has hit me with an iron.

347
00:25:02,228 --> 00:25:05,190
You look more like a Disney witch.
Shut up!

348
00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:06,906
At least I don't look like

349
00:25:06,941 --> 00:25:10,007
somebody's tried to open
a can of beans with my face.

350
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:13,073
Sorry. I didn't want you
bagging me for two weeks.

351
00:25:13,108 --> 00:25:15,116
What difference does it make now?

352
00:25:15,151 --> 00:25:17,240
About two inches to my head.

353
00:25:17,275 --> 00:25:19,329
See him? He's got my profile.

354
00:25:19,364 --> 00:25:20,879
I'm gonna be sick.

355
00:25:20,914 --> 00:25:24,042
Let's be practical -
does he know who you are?

356
00:25:24,077 --> 00:25:26,134
Does he know what you do?

357
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:29,589
He knows his father's in
the show business cosmetics industry.

358
00:25:29,624 --> 00:25:31,796
Oh, Lord! I don't understand.

359
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:33,942
You don't, so stop trying to.

360
00:25:33,977 --> 00:25:36,019
It'll be fine!
It'd better be.

361
00:25:36,054 --> 00:25:39,015
Hello! Oh, stop wearing out
that mirror!

362
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,732
Do you always knock?
Always.

363
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:43,186
Haven't got anything to hide,
have you?

364
00:25:44,229 --> 00:25:46,648
Alright, girls,
you're on in 10 minutes.

365
00:25:46,683 --> 00:25:48,406
You've been on since birth.

366
00:25:48,441 --> 00:25:51,069
The word's out. There's a big crowd.

367
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,113
How big?
A full house.

368
00:25:54,197 --> 00:25:56,998
Where's Benj?
Safe and sound, asleep in bed.

369
00:25:57,033 --> 00:26:00,078
Don't worry about a thing,
my little powder puff.

370
00:26:00,113 --> 00:26:02,170
Can I come in?

371
00:26:02,205 --> 00:26:03,957
Now, there's a gentleman.

372
00:26:03,992 --> 00:26:05,709
Of course you can, Bob.

373
00:26:06,876 --> 00:26:08,837
My Aunt Minnie in here?

374
00:26:10,964 --> 00:26:13,341
Just... wanted to wish you luck.

375
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,343
Thank you, Bob.
Thanks.

376
00:26:17,012 --> 00:26:19,062
To make up for last time.

377
00:26:19,097 --> 00:26:21,815
Thank you. That's so thoughtful.

378
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:24,978
Let's get this show on the road.
You, out.

379
00:26:25,013 --> 00:26:27,313
10-minute curtain call. Good luck.

380
00:26:30,525 --> 00:26:32,909
That's quite a wife you've got, Mitz.

381
00:26:32,944 --> 00:26:36,865
What's her hobby - sanding back
oil tanker hulls with her tongue?

382
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,491
She sure is something!

383
00:26:39,826 --> 00:26:41,418
Oh!
Chookers, girls.

384
00:26:41,453 --> 00:26:43,621
Watch my jaw!
Mind my head.

385
00:26:43,656 --> 00:26:45,248
Aren't we faaa-bulous!

386
00:26:46,332 --> 00:26:49,794
Ladies and gentlemen,
Lasseters Casino, Alice Springs

387
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:51,720
presents Miss Mitzi del Gra,

388
00:26:51,755 --> 00:26:55,675
Miss Felicia Jolly Good Fellow
and Miss Bernadette Basinger -

389
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:58,094
the Sisters of the Simpson Desert.

390
00:27:05,477 --> 00:27:07,625
Meeting Mr Right

391
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,738
The man of my dreams

392
00:27:09,773 --> 00:27:13,943
The one who showed me true love
or at least it seemed

393
00:27:13,978 --> 00:27:17,662
With brown cocoa skin
and curly black hair

394
00:27:17,697 --> 00:27:21,534
Just the way he looks at me -
that gentle, loving stare

395
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:25,837
Finally you came along

396
00:27:25,872 --> 00:27:29,751
The way I feel about you
it just can't be wrong

397
00:27:29,786 --> 00:27:34,130
If you only knew
the way I feel about you

398
00:27:34,165 --> 00:27:37,092
I just can't describe it

399
00:27:37,127 --> 00:27:38,642
Oh, no, no

400
00:27:38,677 --> 00:27:41,144
Finally it's happened to me

401
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:46,142
Right in front of my face
My two lips can't describe it

402
00:27:46,177 --> 00:27:49,152
Finally it's happened to me

403
00:27:49,187 --> 00:27:53,900
Right in front of my face
and I just cannot hide it

404
00:27:53,935 --> 00:27:57,118
Finally it's happened to me

405
00:27:57,153 --> 00:28:01,950
Right in front of my face
My two lips can't describe it

406
00:28:01,985 --> 00:28:05,210
Finally it's happened to me

407
00:28:05,245 --> 00:28:09,958
Right in front of my face
and I just cannot hide it...

408
00:28:09,993 --> 00:28:13,896
Seemed so many times
he seemed to be the one

409
00:28:13,931 --> 00:28:17,764
But all he ever wanted
was to have a little fun

410
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:21,990
But now you've come along
and brightened up my world

411
00:28:22,025 --> 00:28:26,182
In my heart I feel it
I'm that special kind of girl

412
00:28:26,217 --> 00:28:29,859
Finally you came along

413
00:28:29,894 --> 00:28:33,898
The way I feel about you
it just can't be wrong

414
00:28:33,933 --> 00:28:38,194
If you only knew
the way I feel about you

415
00:28:38,229 --> 00:28:41,031
I just can't describe it

416
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:42,539
Oh, no, no

417
00:28:42,574 --> 00:28:45,166
Finally it's happened to me

418
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:49,914
Right in front of my face
My two lips can't describe it

419
00:28:49,949 --> 00:28:53,133
Finally it's happened to me

420
00:28:53,168 --> 00:28:57,922
Right in front of my face
and I just cannot hide it

421
00:28:57,957 --> 00:29:01,182
Finally it's happened to me

422
00:29:01,217 --> 00:29:05,847
Right in front of my face
My two lips can't describe it

423
00:29:05,882 --> 00:29:09,232
Finally it's happened to me

424
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:13,897
Right in front of my face
and I just cannot hide it...

425
00:29:13,932 --> 00:29:15,774
Finally

426
00:29:16,858 --> 00:29:18,491
WWhoa

427
00:29:18,526 --> 00:29:23,448
Finally
Yeah, yeah

428
00:29:23,483 --> 00:29:25,551
Whoa-oh-oh

429
00:29:25,586 --> 00:29:27,707
Finally, baby

430
00:29:27,742 --> 00:29:29,578
Y ea h, yea h, ow

431
00:29:29,613 --> 00:29:31,494
Baby, yeah, yeah

432
00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:33,411
Y ea h, yea h, ow

433
00:29:33,446 --> 00:29:35,454
Baby, yeah, yeah

434
00:29:35,489 --> 00:29:37,455
Y ea h, yea h, ow

435
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,457
Baby, yeah, yeah

436
00:29:39,492 --> 00:29:41,459
Y ea h, yea h, ow

437
00:29:41,494 --> 00:29:43,544
Baby, yeah, yeah

438
00:29:43,579 --> 00:29:45,595
Y ea h, yea h, ow

439
00:30:01,986 --> 00:30:05,121
Finally it's happened to me

440
00:30:05,156 --> 00:30:09,869
Right in front of my face
My two lips can't describe it

441
00:30:09,904 --> 00:30:13,171
Finally it's happened to me

442
00:30:13,206 --> 00:30:17,919
Right in front of my face
and I just cannot hide it

443
00:30:17,954 --> 00:30:24,234
Finally
Oh, yeah

444
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:30,480
Yeah, yeah...

445
00:30:30,515 --> 00:30:33,935
Finally
Oh, yeah.

446
00:30:51,703 --> 00:30:54,587
More!
Bravo!

447
00:30:54,622 --> 00:30:56,458
Beauty!
Come on, everybody!

448
00:30:56,493 --> 00:30:57,966
Yay!
More!

449
00:30:58,001 --> 00:30:59,676
Yes! More!

450
00:30:59,711 --> 00:31:01,254
Hey-hey!
More! More!

451
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,883
More!
You were wonderful!

452
00:31:04,918 --> 00:31:07,006
We want more!
Yes!

453
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:09,111
Magnificent!
Yay!

454
00:31:09,146 --> 00:31:11,146
Bravo! Whoo!
More!

455
00:31:11,181 --> 00:31:14,184
We want more!

456
00:31:15,435 --> 00:31:17,207
Come on, snap out of it.

457
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,945
Come on, mate.

458
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,648
You'll be fine.

459
00:31:22,609 --> 00:31:24,159
Come on, love.

460
00:31:24,194 --> 00:31:26,196
Oh.
That's it, mate.

461
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,331
Scared us all for a minute.

462
00:31:29,366 --> 00:31:32,035
Had to have extra attention,
didn't you?

463
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,079
Nice one, lovey, nice one.

464
00:31:34,114 --> 00:31:35,670
Shit!

465
00:31:35,705 --> 00:31:37,422
What are you doing, Marian?

466
00:31:37,457 --> 00:31:40,418
You liar!
You said he was in bed.

467
00:31:40,453 --> 00:31:42,020
Shh! Drink your daiquiri.

468
00:31:42,055 --> 00:31:43,553
I hate bloody daiquiri!

469
00:31:43,588 --> 00:31:45,805
You don't.
You love bloody daiquiris.

470
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,635
Now I know why drag queens
drink from big glasses.

471
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:53,323
To make their hands look smaller!
Oh, ha ha, Marian!

472
00:31:53,358 --> 00:31:56,976
What do I tell the boy?
I've never been so embarrassed.

473
00:31:57,011 --> 00:31:58,808
You're overreacting.
Really?!

474
00:31:58,843 --> 00:32:00,570
Yes. You're being a drama queen.

475
00:32:00,605 --> 00:32:04,401
You'd better drop that shit
if you're gonna be a good father.

476
00:32:04,436 --> 00:32:07,404
And don't pretend to be surprised.
It's your turn.

477
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:10,156
Not forever -
maybe just a couple of months.

478
00:32:10,191 --> 00:32:11,706
Yeah, but why now?

479
00:32:11,741 --> 00:32:14,536
Because I haven't had a holiday
in eight years.

480
00:32:14,571 --> 00:32:16,955
I need a rest, Tick. I need space.

481
00:32:18,164 --> 00:32:21,418
Reminds me of something I said.
Well, I do.

482
00:32:21,453 --> 00:32:24,087
It's time he knew his father anyway.

483
00:32:24,122 --> 00:32:25,630
Yeah, that's the problem.

484
00:32:25,665 --> 00:32:27,389
What do I tell him?

485
00:32:27,424 --> 00:32:29,808
What do you assume I do - lie?

486
00:32:29,843 --> 00:32:32,303
Assumption's the mother
of all fuck-ups.

487
00:32:32,338 --> 00:32:33,979
Bitch to him, not me.

488
00:32:34,014 --> 00:32:37,017
You might be surprised.
Thanks for the free advice.

489
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,171
Who is it?

490
00:32:46,206 --> 00:32:47,944
It's me, Bob.

491
00:32:52,407 --> 00:32:54,492
Your flowers were being mangled.

492
00:32:54,527 --> 00:32:56,578
Thought I'd rescue them for you.

493
00:32:59,664 --> 00:33:02,042
Good idea. Thanks.

494
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:13,219
What's the matter?

495
00:33:14,471 --> 00:33:16,139
Nothing.

496
00:33:20,185 --> 00:33:23,104
Know what your father does
for a living?

497
00:33:23,139 --> 00:33:24,689
Yeah.

498
00:33:27,776 --> 00:33:30,945
So you know he doesn't
really like girls then?

499
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,323
Does he have a boyfriend
at the moment?

500
00:33:34,783 --> 00:33:36,333
No.

501
00:33:36,368 --> 00:33:37,917
Neither does Mum.

502
00:33:37,952 --> 00:33:41,081
She had a girlfriend,
but she got over her.

503
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:48,254
Want to play in my room?
I've got Lego.

504
00:33:49,381 --> 00:33:51,091
Sure.

505
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,647
Come on, Butch. Get moving.

506
00:33:58,682 --> 00:34:01,149
We can't brand the cattle
by ourselves.

507
00:34:01,184 --> 00:34:04,729
Great show last night.
You always end a number like that?

508
00:34:04,764 --> 00:34:06,523
Always.

509
00:34:07,941 --> 00:34:11,194
How'd you like to pick her up
every night, Sundance?

510
00:34:11,229 --> 00:34:12,702
Be a pleasure.

511
00:34:12,737 --> 00:34:15,865
That might include
tucking the lady into bed, Jeff.

512
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,540
What's the pay like, Marian?

513
00:34:17,575 --> 00:34:20,161
He'll get himself into trouble
one day.

514
00:34:20,196 --> 00:34:22,747
And you might just be
the lucky fellow.

515
00:34:22,782 --> 00:34:24,297
All aboard!

516
00:34:24,332 --> 00:34:26,688
So take a letter, Maria

517
00:34:26,723 --> 00:34:28,760
Address it to my wife...

518
00:34:28,795 --> 00:34:31,005
Watch it with the innuendos.

519
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,181
Give me a clear shot at this.

520
00:34:33,216 --> 00:34:37,053
You call dressing like a Xanadu
production number a clear shot?

521
00:34:37,088 --> 00:34:39,389
Come on, Tick! Who's kidding who?

522
00:34:39,424 --> 00:34:41,825
He sure as shit isn't.

523
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,227
Sehd a ocopy to hmy awyer

524
00:34:45,353 --> 00:34:47,188
Gotta start a new life

525
00:34:48,356 --> 00:34:49,906
You've been many things

526
00:34:49,941 --> 00:34:53,445
But most of all
a good secretary to me...

527
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,953
Um, wave...

528
00:34:54,988 --> 00:34:57,115
What am I doing?
Swimming!

529
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,947
Um...

530
00:34:58,982 --> 00:35:00,709
Murray.

531
00:35:00,744 --> 00:35:02,627
Rock...
Murray rock...

532
00:35:02,662 --> 00:35:05,248
River rock... Oh, Rock! Rock Hudson!

533
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:08,675
Silly dag!
Didn't you get Doris Day?

534
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:12,130
My turn! My turn!
OK, smartypants, you try.

535
00:35:13,173 --> 00:35:14,966
Come on, then.

536
00:35:15,001 --> 00:35:16,725
It's a...
Person.

537
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,303
A sexy woman.
Cat?

538
00:35:18,338 --> 00:35:20,009
Famous woman.

539
00:35:20,044 --> 00:35:21,646
Um...
Oh, ah...

540
00:35:21,681 --> 00:35:23,328
Baby.
Oh, ah, rocking.

541
00:35:23,363 --> 00:35:24,941
Oh, I know this one.

542
00:35:24,976 --> 00:35:27,520
Racehorse!
Cat. Scary cat.

543
00:35:27,555 --> 00:35:29,147
Er, scary moose.

544
00:35:29,182 --> 00:35:30,655
Scary dog?

545
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,365
I know, I know!
No?

546
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,903
Oh, Lindy Chamberlain.

547
00:35:36,488 --> 00:35:38,302
That was appalling, Benji.

548
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:40,269
Who taught you that?
Mum did.

549
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,441
Lies! All lies!
I thought so.

550
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:44,695
Come on, Adam.

551
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,880
Up!

552
00:35:46,915 --> 00:35:48,798
Time is against us.

553
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:51,044
And we have things to do.

554
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:55,924
Come on, you butch thing, you.

555
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:57,682
No, no, count me out.

556
00:35:57,717 --> 00:36:00,136
All for one...
Come on, Tick.

557
00:36:00,171 --> 00:36:01,721
No.

558
00:36:03,014 --> 00:36:04,648
Hmm.

559
00:36:04,683 --> 00:36:07,268
Come on, Adam. Let's get frocked.

560
00:36:14,067 --> 00:36:15,742
So, uh...

561
00:36:15,777 --> 00:36:19,739
...er, what's it like
to finally have a father?

562
00:36:19,774 --> 00:36:21,449
It's OK.

563
00:36:26,287 --> 00:36:28,213
I'm sorry about last night.

564
00:36:28,248 --> 00:36:31,251
I don't always dress up
in women's clothes.

565
00:36:31,286 --> 00:36:34,254
I mean, you know,
don't get the wrong idea.

566
00:36:35,422 --> 00:36:37,013
Um...

567
00:36:37,048 --> 00:36:39,516
I do a lot of different stuff.

568
00:36:39,551 --> 00:36:44,639
You know,
like... Elvis and Gary Glitter.

569
00:36:44,674 --> 00:36:46,224
Abba?

570
00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:52,397
I'm not supposed to know
about the Abba show.

571
00:36:52,432 --> 00:36:54,899
But I'd really like to see it.

572
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:57,110
Would you do Abba for me?

573
00:36:58,611 --> 00:37:00,321
Sure.

574
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,204
You know what I am, don't you?

575
00:37:09,289 --> 00:37:12,000
Mum says you're the best
in the business.

576
00:37:13,376 --> 00:37:17,047
Ah, well, your mother was always
prone to exaggeration.

577
00:37:20,216 --> 00:37:23,345
Will you have a boyfriend
when we're in Sydney?

578
00:37:27,682 --> 00:37:29,267
Maybe.

579
00:37:31,102 --> 00:37:32,771
That's good.

580
00:37:44,616 --> 00:37:47,000
Come on!
Where are we going?

581
00:37:47,035 --> 00:37:49,537
To unleash the best in the business.

582
00:37:57,253 --> 00:37:59,005
I had a dream.

583
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:39,112
Well...

584
00:39:39,147 --> 00:39:41,149
...we did it.

585
00:39:42,442 --> 00:39:44,611
It never ends, does it?

586
00:39:44,646 --> 00:39:46,321
All that space.

587
00:39:51,493 --> 00:39:53,286
So, what now?

588
00:39:54,329 --> 00:39:56,831
I think I want to go home.

589
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,543
Me too.

590
00:40:02,003 --> 00:40:03,762
Well, then...

591
00:40:03,797 --> 00:40:07,592
...let's finish the shows
and go home.

592
00:40:22,023 --> 00:40:24,526
Don't go without leaving me
your number.

593
00:40:24,561 --> 00:40:26,034
Already taken care of, Jeff.

594
00:40:26,069 --> 00:40:28,697
It's at the bar end
of the men's cubicle -

595
00:40:28,732 --> 00:40:30,612
"For a good time, phone Felicia. "

596
00:40:30,647 --> 00:40:32,457
Can we stop at McDonald's?
Good idea.

597
00:40:32,492 --> 00:40:35,537
I've had enough of this shitty food.
Fucking crayfish.

598
00:40:35,572 --> 00:40:37,660
Where the hell do you start?

599
00:40:37,695 --> 00:40:39,714
Lay it on the line, husband.

600
00:40:39,749 --> 00:40:41,466
Don't conceal anything -
that's the key.

601
00:40:41,501 --> 00:40:45,005
If he doesn't like it, stiff
bickies, he can always come back.

602
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,424
What happens when people
hear about Mitzi's minor?

603
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:49,265
That's your problem, not his.

604
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:53,138
Morals are a choice. He'll decide
his own when he's ready.

605
00:40:53,173 --> 00:40:55,605
Well, that's it. You're all packed.

606
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,310
You're joking?! Bernadette's shoes
aren't on board yet.

607
00:40:59,345 --> 00:41:02,230
Hate to say this -
wish I was going with you.

608
00:41:02,265 --> 00:41:04,280
Your gas tank will be fine.

609
00:41:04,315 --> 00:41:06,366
Your axle... may be another matter.

610
00:41:06,401 --> 00:41:09,258
The road will be filled
with bored mechanics

611
00:41:09,293 --> 00:41:12,115
hoping some drag queens
will spirit them away.

612
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,489
We won't spirit gum at this rate.

613
00:41:14,524 --> 00:41:16,828
Where the hell's Bernadette?
Here.

614
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:21,583
Come on, cabanossi tits.
Where are your bags?

615
00:41:21,618 --> 00:41:23,209
In my room.

616
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:28,346
I'm not going.
I'm staying here for a while.

617
00:41:28,381 --> 00:41:32,260
Oh, really? And you're choosing
to tell us about this now?

618
00:41:32,295 --> 00:41:34,769
She told me a few weeks back.

619
00:41:34,804 --> 00:41:38,266
Somebody's got to handle the guest
entertainment while I'm away.

620
00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:41,478
I get it.
Who's been playing hide the sausage?

621
00:41:43,646 --> 00:41:45,774
Let's go before I throw up.

622
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:47,324
Come on, Benj.

623
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,131
Hope you can drive.

624
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:50,904
Hey, not without a hug!

625
00:41:50,939 --> 00:41:52,697
Waaaa!
Waaaa!

626
00:41:56,201 --> 00:41:57,952
Are you sure?

627
00:41:59,037 --> 00:42:00,705
No, I'm not sure.

628
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,669
I'll never know
unless I give it a shot.

629
00:42:20,934 --> 00:42:23,061
I'm as jealous as all hell.

630
00:42:25,146 --> 00:42:28,358
Shit! Raccoon time again.

631
00:42:32,237 --> 00:42:34,614
Don't forget to write!
See ya!

632
00:42:34,649 --> 00:42:36,122
Wish I was staying.

633
00:42:36,157 --> 00:42:38,576
'Bye!
'Bye! Take care of her now!

634
00:42:38,611 --> 00:42:40,449
'Bye, Mum. 'Bye, Ralph!

635
00:42:40,484 --> 00:42:42,288
Yeah, see ya, Ralph!

636
00:42:43,832 --> 00:42:49,504
I've been cheated by you
since I don't know when

637
00:42:51,756 --> 00:42:56,803
So I've made up my mind
it must come to an end

638
00:42:59,347 --> 00:43:03,018
Look at me now
Will I ever learn?

639
00:43:03,053 --> 00:43:04,818
I don't know how

640
00:43:04,853 --> 00:43:08,210
But I suddenly lose control

641
00:43:08,245 --> 00:43:11,568
There's a fire within my soul

642
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:15,988
Just one look
and I can hear a bell ring

643
00:43:16,023 --> 00:43:19,367
One more look
and I forget everything

644
00:43:19,402 --> 00:43:21,042
WWhoa

645
00:43:21,077 --> 00:43:24,170
Mama mia
Here I go again

646
00:43:24,205 --> 00:43:27,708
My, my, how can I resist you?

647
00:43:27,743 --> 00:43:31,177
Mama mia
Does it show again

648
00:43:31,212 --> 00:43:34,632
My, my, just how much I missed you?

649
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:38,090
Yes, I've been broken-hearted

650
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:41,738
Blue since the day we parted

651
00:43:41,773 --> 00:43:45,352
Why, why
did I ever let you go?

652
00:43:45,387 --> 00:43:48,737
Mama mia
Now I really know

653
00:43:48,772 --> 00:43:52,233
My, my,
I could never let you go...

654
00:43:59,324 --> 00:44:03,119
I've been angry and sad
about things that you do

655
00:44:06,331 --> 00:44:10,502
I can't count all the times
that I told you we're through

656
00:44:13,171 --> 00:44:16,806
How can you go
when you slam the door?

657
00:44:16,841 --> 00:44:21,888
I think you know
that you won't be away too long

658
00:44:21,923 --> 00:44:26,066
You know that I'm not that strong

659
00:44:26,101 --> 00:44:29,646
Just one look
and I can hear a bell ring

660
00:44:29,681 --> 00:44:33,191
One more look
and I forget everything

661
00:44:33,226 --> 00:44:34,699
WWhoa

662
00:44:34,734 --> 00:44:38,091
Mama mia
Here I go again

663
00:44:38,126 --> 00:44:41,414
My, my, how can I resist you?

664
00:44:41,449 --> 00:44:44,959
Mama mia
Does it show again

665
00:44:44,994 --> 00:44:48,338
My, my,
just how much I missed you?

666
00:44:48,373 --> 00:44:51,793
Yes, I've been broken-hearted

667
00:44:51,828 --> 00:44:55,418
Blue since the day we parted

668
00:44:55,453 --> 00:44:59,009
Why, why
did I ever let you go?

669
00:44:59,044 --> 00:45:02,352
Mama mia
Now I really know

670
00:45:02,387 --> 00:45:06,057
Why, why
I could never let you go.

671
00:45:24,576 --> 00:45:26,334
No, that's enough.

672
00:45:26,369 --> 00:45:28,455
Oh, my tits are falling down!

673
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,937
Oh, Jesus!

674
00:45:31,972 --> 00:45:33,800
Thank you!

675
00:45:33,835 --> 00:45:36,296
Thank you. It's good to be home!

676
00:45:54,647 --> 00:45:59,464
Sometimes the snow
comes down in June

677
00:45:59,499 --> 00:46:04,282
Sometimes the sun
goes round the moon

678
00:46:04,317 --> 00:46:09,304
I see the passion in your eyes

679
00:46:09,339 --> 00:46:14,257
Sometimes it's all a big surprise

680
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:19,839
'Cause there was a time
when all I did was wish

681
00:46:19,874 --> 00:46:24,100
You'd tell me this was love

682
00:46:24,135 --> 00:46:30,100
It's not the way I hoped
or how I planned

683
00:46:30,135 --> 00:46:34,277
But somehow it's enough

684
00:46:34,312 --> 00:46:39,233
And now we're standing face to face

685
00:46:39,268 --> 00:46:44,120
Isn't this world a crazy place?

686
00:46:44,155 --> 00:46:49,202
Just when I thought
our chance had passed

687
00:46:49,237 --> 00:46:55,917
You go and save the best for last

688
00:47:01,798 --> 00:47:06,393
All of the nights you came to me

689
00:47:06,428 --> 00:47:11,412
When some silly girl
had set you free

690
00:47:11,447 --> 00:47:16,396
You wondered
how you'd make it through

691
00:47:16,431 --> 00:47:21,741
I wondered what was wrong with you

692
00:47:21,776 --> 00:47:27,574
'Cause how could you give your love
to someone else

693
00:47:27,609 --> 00:47:31,543
And share your dreams with me?

694
00:47:31,578 --> 00:47:37,584
Sometimes the very thing
you're looking for

695
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:41,803
Is the one thing you can't see

696
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:46,864
But now we're standing face to face

697
00:47:46,899 --> 00:47:51,855
Isn't this world a crazy place?

698
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:56,644
Just when I thought
our chance had passed

699
00:47:56,679 --> 00:48:03,193
You go and save the best for last

700
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:11,826
Sometimes the snow
comes down in June

701
00:48:11,861 --> 00:48:16,702
Sometimes the sun
goes round the moon

702
00:48:16,737 --> 00:48:21,544
Just when I thought
our chance had passed

703
00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:28,385
You go and save the best for last

704
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:35,684
You went and saved the best...

705
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:41,815
...for last

706
00:48:42,941 --> 00:48:47,112
Yeah, yeah.

707
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,103
