I've got a good mind
to put you over my knee.

- I'll spank, spank you back.
- Benj.

Do you remember Tick?

Hello, Tick.

Hello.

- Yes?

Congratulations. It's a boy.

- BERNADETTE: Help.
- Oh, my God.

953
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:00,818
For Christ sake, Mitz,
why didn't you tell us?

954
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:03,237
Why the hell did you have to
shock me like that?

955
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:08,284
This lump on my head
is getting bigger by the second.

956
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:10,995
I'm about to make
my Northern Territories debut

957
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:13,622
looking like a fucking
Warner Brothers cartoon character

958
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:15,332
has hit me over the head with an iron.

959
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:16,959
I think you look more
like a Disney witch, myself.

960
01:19:17,127 --> 01:19:19,754
Oh, shut your face, Felicia.
At least I don't look like

961
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:21,839
somebody's tried to open
a can of beans with my face.

962
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:22,923
I'm sorry, girls.

963
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:25,426
I couldn't stand the thought of you
bagging me on the bus for two weeks.

964
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:27,344
Anyway, what difference
does it make now?

965
01:19:27,512 --> 01:19:29,513
About two inches to my head, for one.

966
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:32,183
Did you get a good look at him?
He's got my profile, that's for sure.

967
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:33,225
I think I'm gonna be sick.

968
01:19:33,393 --> 01:19:36,353
I hate to be practical here,
but does he know who you are?

969
01:19:36,521 --> 01:19:38,189
I mean, does he know
what you do for a living?

970
01:19:38,356 --> 01:19:42,526
He knows he has a father in the
show business, cosmetics industry.

971
01:19:42,694 --> 01:19:44,528
Oh, Lord. I don't understand.

972
01:19:44,696 --> 01:19:46,489
No, you don't understand,
so stop trying to.

973
01:19:46,656 --> 01:19:48,240
- It'll be fine.
- It better be.

Hello! Stop wearing out that mirror.

- Always. Why?

You haven't got anything to
hide in there, have you?

977
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:58,626
All right, girls,
you're on in 10 minutes.

978

Sweetheart, you've been on

Hope you're ready to slay them.
The word's out, we've got a big crowd.

Don't mean to barge in.
Just wanted to wish you luck.

- Thank you, Bob.
- Thanks.

To make up for what happened last time.

991
01:20:31,451 --> 01:20:34,745
Thank you. That's so thoughtful.

All right, girls,
let's get this show on the road.

you've got there, Mitz.

What does she do in her spare time,

998

sand back the hulls of oil tankers
with her tongue?

- Chookers, girls.
- Watch my jaw.

I've never been so embarrassed.

Yes, you're just being a drama queen.

Because I haven't had a holiday

not so long ago.

Well, I do. And besides, it's time
he knew who his father was anyway.

Yeah, and that's the problem.
I mean, I don't know what to tell him.

he doesn't really like girls then.

Does he have a boyfriend at the moment?

- No.
- Neither does mum.

but she got over her.

1092
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:40,290
- BOB: Race horse.
- FELICIA: Cat. Scary cat.

1093
01:29:40,458 --> 01:29:41,958
Scary moose.

1094
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:43,794
- Scary dog.
- BOB: I know, I know.

1095
01:29:43,961 --> 01:29:45,253
FELICIA: No?

1096
01:29:46,005 --> 01:29:47,381
BERNADETTE: Lindy Chamberlain.

1097
01:29:49,175 --> 01:29:51,510
That was appalling, Benji.
Who taught you that?

1098
01:29:51,677 --> 01:29:53,804
- Mum did.
- MARION: Lies, all lies.

1099
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:59,142
Come on, Adam. Up.

1100
01:30:00,144 --> 01:30:03,814
Time is against us,
and we have things to do.

1101
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:10,153
- Come on, you butch thing, you.
- No, count me out.

1102
01:30:10,905 --> 01:30:12,531
- All for one.
- FELICIA: Come on, Tick.

1103
01:30:12,698 --> 01:30:13,865
No.

1104
01:30:17,787 --> 01:30:20,122
BERNADETTE: Come on, Adam,
let's get frocked.

1105
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:28,088
So...

1106
01:30:29,173 --> 01:30:32,300
What's it like to finally have a father?

1107
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:34,511
It's okay.

1108
01:30:39,517 --> 01:30:41,143
Sorry about last night.

1109
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:43,645
I don't always dress up
in women's clothes.

1110
01:30:43,813 --> 01:30:46,523
I mean, you know,
don't get the wrong idea.

1111
01:30:49,902 --> 01:30:51,695
I mean, I do a lot of
different stuff, you know,

1112
01:30:51,863 --> 01:30:56,992
like Elvis and Gary Glitter.

1113
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:58,660
ABBA?

1114
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:05,125
I'm not supposed to know
about the ABBA show,

1115
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:07,002
but I'd really like to see it.

1116
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:10,213
Would you do ABBA for me?

1117
01:31:11,841 --> 01:31:13,049
Sure.

1118
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:20,599
You know what I am, don't you?

1119
01:31:22,268 --> 01:31:24,144
Mum says you're
the best in the business.

1120
01:31:26,522 --> 01:31:29,191
Well, your mother was always
prone to exaggeration.

1121
01:31:33,237 --> 01:31:36,531
Will you have a boyfriend
when we get back to Sydney?

1122
01:31:40,703 --> 01:31:42,204
Maybe.

1123
01:31:44,123 --> 01:31:45,624
That's good.

1124
01:31:57,678 --> 01:31:59,596
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

1125
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:02,140
We're gonna unleash
the best in the business.

1126
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:11,816
I had a dream.

1127
01:33:50,583 --> 01:33:53,543
MITZI: Well, we did it.

1128
01:33:55,588 --> 01:33:57,088
It never ends, does it?

1129
01:33:57,715 --> 01:33:59,382
All that space.

1130
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,264
So what now?

1131
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:09,643
I think I wanna go home.

1132
01:34:12,021 --> 01:34:13,271
Me, too.

1133
01:34:15,358 --> 01:34:20,236
Well, then, let's finish
the shows and go home.

1134
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:37,337
Hey, don't go without leaving me
your number, sunshine.

1135
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:38,797
Already taken care of, Jeff.

1136
01:34:38,964 --> 01:34:40,840
It's at the far end
of the men's cubicle.

1137
01:34:41,008 --> 01:34:42,759
"For a good time, phone Felicia."

1138
01:34:42,927 --> 01:34:45,345
Hey, can we stop at McDonald's
on the way back?

1139
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:46,429
That's a good idea.

1140
01:34:46,597 --> 01:34:48,098
I've had just about enough of
this shitty food. Fucking crawfish.

1141
01:34:48,265 --> 01:34:49,849
I don't know.
Where the hell do you start?

1142
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:52,936
Stop it. Lay it on the line, husband.
Don't conceal a thing.

1143
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:55,522
That's the key. And if he doesn't
like it, stiff bikkies.

1144
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:56,940
He can always buy his own ticket back.

1145
01:34:57,108 --> 01:34:59,317
What happens when word gets out
that Mitzi's got a minor?

1146
01:34:59,485 --> 01:35:02,112
That's your problem, not his.
He knows when and where to listen.

1147
01:35:02,279 --> 01:35:03,988
Morals are a choice,
and he'll decide his own

1148
01:35:04,156 --> 01:35:05,865
when he's good and bloody well ready.

1149
01:35:06,033 --> 01:35:08,284
Well, that's it. You're all packed.

1150
01:35:08,452 --> 01:35:09,577
Gotta be joking.

1151

We haven't got Bernadette's shoes
up on board yet.

1152
01:35:12,832 --> 01:35:15,166
I hate to say this.
Wish I was going with you.

1153
01:35:15,334 --> 01:35:19,129
Your gas tank will be fine.
Your axle may be another matter.

1154
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:21,589
I'm sure the road home
will just be filled with bored mechanics

1155

to spirit them away to a better life.

1156
01:35:24,427 --> 01:35:27,095
I wish. We're not even gonna
spirit gum at this rate.

1157
01:35:27,263 --> 01:35:29,347
- Where the hell's Bernadette?
- Here.

1158

Where are your bags?

1159
01:35:35,062 --> 01:35:36,563
BERNADETTE: In my room.

1160
01:35:38,315 --> 01:35:41,151
I'm not going.
I've decided to stay here for a while.

1161
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:44,988
Oh, really? And you're choosing
to tell us about this now?

1162
01:35:45,823 --> 01:35:48,533
She told me a few weeks back.
Just when I was looking for somebody

1163
01:35:48,701 --> 01:35:50,702
to handle the guest entertainment

hide the sausage, then?

1166
01:35:56,208 --> 01:35:58,334
That's it.
Let's get out of here before I throw up.

1167
01:35:58,502 --> 01:35:59,669

No, I'm not sure.
