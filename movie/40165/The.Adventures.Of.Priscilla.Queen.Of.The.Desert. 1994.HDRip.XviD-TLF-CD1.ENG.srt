00:00:46,763 --> 00:00:50,308
Hey, lady, you, lady

3
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:53,818
Cursin' at your life

4
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:57,857
You're a discontented mother

5
00:00:57,892 --> 00:01:02,327
And a regimented wife

6
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:06,324
I've no doubt you dream about

7
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:09,417
The things you never do

8
00:01:09,452 --> 00:01:13,414
But I wish someone
had've talked to me

9
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:16,966
Like I wanna talk to you

10
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:21,798
Ooh, I've been to Georgia
and California

11
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:25,516
And anywhere I could run

12
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:29,221
Took the hand of a preacher man

13
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,857
And we made love in the sun

14
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:37,438
But I ran out of places
and friendly faces

15
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:41,251
Because I had to be free

16
00:01:41,286 --> 00:01:45,201
I've been to paradise

17
00:01:45,236 --> 00:01:49,117
But I've never been to me

18
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:55,665
Please, lady
Please, lady

19
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,508
Don't just walk away

20
00:01:58,543 --> 00:02:02,422
'Cause I have this need to tell you

21
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:06,839
Why I'm all alone today

22
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:10,800
I can see so much of me

23
00:02:10,835 --> 00:02:14,691
Still living in your eyes

24
00:02:14,726 --> 00:02:18,945
Won't you share a part
of a weary heart

25
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,073
That has lived a million lies?

26
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:26,654
Oh, I've been to Nice
and the isle of Greece

27
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:30,717
While I sipped champagne
on a yacht

28
00:02:30,752 --> 00:02:34,746
I've moved like Harlow
in Monte Carlo

29
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:37,599
And showed 'em what I've got

30
00:02:37,634 --> 00:02:40,068
I've been undressed by kings

31
00:02:40,103 --> 00:02:42,468
And I've seen some things

32
00:02:42,503 --> 00:02:46,507
That a woman ain't s'posed to see

33
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:52,134
I've been to paradise

34
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:57,727
But I've never been

35
00:02:57,762 --> 00:03:01,894
To me

36
00:03:01,929 --> 00:03:05,992
Ooooh

37
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:09,871
I've been to paradise...

38
00:03:09,906 --> 00:03:13,124
Never been to me.
More! More!

39
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,126
More!

40
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:18,296
Oh, please!

41
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,792
Next!
Put it away, sweetie!

42
00:03:24,796 --> 00:03:26,339
Ugh!

43
00:03:28,257 --> 00:03:30,677
Are you OK?
Yeah.

44
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:36,432
That was fuckin' charming,
you gutless pack of dickheads.

45
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:39,185
Fuck off, you talentless dog!
What was that?

46
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,235
Show us your pink bits!
No!

47
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,988
Know why this microphone
has such a long cord?

48
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:47,568
So it's easily retrieved
after I've shoved it up YOUR arse.

49
00:03:56,285 --> 00:03:58,246
Christ almighty!

50
00:03:59,497 --> 00:04:02,250
What the fuck's
going on out there tonight?

51
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:04,877
Are you hurt?

52
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,132
Alright, which one of you bitches
sat on my dress?

53
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:11,217
Tick, darling, it's for you.

54
00:04:13,094 --> 00:04:15,645
Hello.
Ding dong, Avon calling.

55
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,808
Howdy, sunshine. Long time no hear.

56
00:04:20,018 --> 00:04:22,895
Where?
Emergency ward A.

57
00:04:25,273 --> 00:04:27,865
Mr Belrose?

58
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,403
Yes?

59
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:35,700
So... how about it?

60
00:04:40,663 --> 00:04:43,082
Leave him alone!
Fuck off!

61
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,794
Get... get off him!

62
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:51,507
Taxi! Taxi!

63
00:05:00,516 --> 00:05:02,025
Yeah?

64
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,569
Bernadette? It's Tick.

65
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,648
Sorry to call you so late, but I...

66
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:10,463
Hey, are you OK?

67
00:05:10,498 --> 00:05:12,201
No, I'm not.

68
00:05:12,236 --> 00:05:14,364
Well... what's the matter?

69
00:05:15,656 --> 00:05:17,200
Trumpet just died.

70
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,960
"... and established it on the floods. "

71
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:31,022
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

72
00:05:31,057 --> 00:05:34,050
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

73
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:36,552
"He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

74
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,311
"He restoreth my soul.

75
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:41,099
"He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness... "

76
00:05:41,134 --> 00:05:42,732
"... for his name's sake.

77
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:46,938
"Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

78
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:50,400
"I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

79
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:52,450
"Thy rod and staff comfort me.

80
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:56,656
"Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

81
00:05:56,691 --> 00:06:00,135
"Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.

82
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,772
"Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all my life,

83
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:07,375
"and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever. "

84
00:06:09,252 --> 00:06:10,760
It's not fair.

85
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:13,402
I spent half my life
and all my savings

86
00:06:13,437 --> 00:06:15,974
trying to snag
a sympathetic husband.

87
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:19,268
And the selfish little shit
goes and dies on me.

88
00:06:19,303 --> 00:06:24,767
25 years old, and he goes
and slips over in a bathroom.

89
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:26,275
He didn't slip.

90
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,815
He was peroxiding his hair at home
and he asphyxiated on the fumes.

91
00:06:33,317 --> 00:06:34,867
I need some space.

92
00:06:34,902 --> 00:06:38,364
I've, um... been asked to do a show
out of town.

93
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,791
That's nice.
Well, why don't you come with me?

94
00:06:41,826 --> 00:06:45,621
I'll need some help, and...
we could both use the break.

95
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,707
You're not wrong. Where is it?

96
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:49,215
Um... Alice Springs.

97
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,927
You've got to be fucking joking!

98
00:06:52,962 --> 00:07:00,345
Wo-Man is a... unique range
of speciality facial products

99
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,767
designed for the more...
heavy-duty woman in us all.

100
00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:08,245
Now, um... this week...

101
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,688
Excuse me.

102
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:13,990
Um... hello?

103
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:16,069
How long is the run?

104
00:07:17,195 --> 00:07:18,703
Four weeks.

105
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:22,283
Equity minimum, two shows a night,
accommodation included.

106
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,628
I can't just sit around here
crying all the time.

107
00:07:27,663 --> 00:07:31,167
Jesus! My mascara keeps running.
I look like a raccoon.

108
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:34,427
Good girl!
That's the spirit.

109
00:07:34,462 --> 00:07:38,466
Here's hoping the desert's
big enough for the two of us.

110
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:41,267
Um... three of us.

111
00:07:41,302 --> 00:07:42,935
A desert holiday

112
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,812
Let's pack the drag away

113
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:48,434
You take the lunch and tea
I'll take the ecstasy

114
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:50,245
Fuck off, you silly queer

115
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,986
I'm getting out of here

116
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:55,149
A desert holiday
Hip, hip, hip, hip, hooray.

117
00:07:58,903 --> 00:08:00,592
Why?

118
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:02,246
Why not?

119
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,535
Look, he's turned into
a bloody good little performer.

120
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,043
That's right.

121
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:09,309
A bloody good little performer.

122
00:08:09,344 --> 00:08:11,652
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

123
00:08:11,687 --> 00:08:13,925
I thought we were escaping
this shit.

124
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,761
Two's company, three's a party,
Bernadette my sweet.

125
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:21,551
We're unplugging our curling wands
and going bush, Felicia.

126
00:08:21,586 --> 00:08:24,137
Why would you possibly
leave all this glamour

127
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:26,020
for a hike into nowhere?

128
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:28,141
You really want to know?
Desperately.

129
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:33,875
Well, ever since I was a lad
I've had this dream -

130
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:37,942
a dream that I now, finally,
have a chance to fulfil.

131
00:08:37,977 --> 00:08:39,575
And that is...?

132
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,155
To travel to the centre
of Australia,

133
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,372
climb Kings Canyon - as a queen -

134
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:48,244
in a full-length Gaultier sequin,
heels and a tiara.

135
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:53,958
Great. That's just what
this country needs.

136
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:56,676
A cock in a frock on a rock.

137
00:08:56,711 --> 00:08:59,429
Get back in your kennels,
both of you.

138
00:08:59,464 --> 00:09:03,217
Now, the first thing
we have to work out...

139
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,720
...is how the hell we get there.

140
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,075
Ta-da!

141
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,785
What do you think?

142
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,948
When do we have to
return it to the school?

143
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,575
We don't. We own it.

144
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:30,126
What?!

145
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:35,625
Well, I met some nice 'Svedish'
tourists called Lars, Lars and Lars

146
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,520
and I coaxed it out of them
for $10,000.

147
00:09:38,555 --> 00:09:41,346
We can't afford it.
Well, that's right.

148
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:44,509
"Mummy,
maybe a trip to the outback

149
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:50,056
"would help me get over this little
'phase' I'm going through.

150
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,974
"And you never know - I might meet
some lovely country girl. "

151
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:56,145
I hereby christen
this budget Barbie camper...

152
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,737
...Priscilla -

153
00:09:57,772 --> 00:09:59,482
Queen of the Desert.

154
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,655
That must be the understatement
of the century.

155
00:10:16,374 --> 00:10:17,924
Together

156
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:20,294
WWe w go ou r way

157
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:22,011
Together

158
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:23,881
WWe w eave sohme day

159
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,734
Together...
Mum!

160
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:27,552
Your hand in my hand

161
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:29,185
Together

162
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,201
We will make the plans...

163
00:10:31,236 --> 00:10:33,147
Ladies and gentlemen!

164
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:36,289
We're here today to see off
a very brave woman

165
00:10:36,324 --> 00:10:39,397
who will attempt to cross
a continent alone.

166
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:41,482
On behalf of all her sponsors...

167
00:10:43,151 --> 00:10:44,659
Together

168
00:10:44,694 --> 00:10:46,404
This is what we'll do

169
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:48,162
Go west

170
00:10:48,197 --> 00:10:50,033
Life is peaceful there

171
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:51,791
Go west

172
00:10:51,826 --> 00:10:53,578
Lots of open air

173
00:10:53,613 --> 00:10:55,253
Go west

174
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,227
To begin anew

175
00:10:57,262 --> 00:10:59,132
Go west
ad es

176
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:01,919
...start your engines.
This is what we'll do

177
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:03,428
Go west

178
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,256
Sun in wintertime

179
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,056
Go west

180
00:11:07,091 --> 00:11:08,926
We will do just fine

181
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,727
Go west

182
00:11:10,762 --> 00:11:12,597
Where the skies are blue

183
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:14,272
Go west

184
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,559
This is what we'll do

185
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:18,067
Together

186
00:11:18,102 --> 00:11:20,313
We will love the beach

187
00:11:20,348 --> 00:11:22,030
Together

188
00:11:22,065 --> 00:11:23,983
We will learn and teach

189
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:25,783
Together

190
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,987
Change our pace of life

191
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:29,537
Together

192
00:11:29,572 --> 00:11:31,831
We will work and strive...

193
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:34,584
This old man
He played two

194
00:11:34,619 --> 00:11:36,454
He played knick-knack
with my poo...

195
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:38,254
Please!
Knick-knack paddy-whack...

196
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:41,668
Give me a break!
This old man came rolling home.

197
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:45,178
Four fat trannies
working on the wall

198
00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:48,675
And if one fat trannie
should accidentally fall...

199
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:52,470
My darling Clementine

200
00:11:52,505 --> 00:11:55,390
Da da da da...

201
00:11:57,475 --> 00:12:00,436
How long have we been on the road?

202
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:02,855
4 and a half hours.

203
00:12:03,898 --> 00:12:07,360
I've got
a splitting headache already.

204
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,373
Happy hour!
Mother's ruin pour moi.

205
00:12:13,408 --> 00:12:17,036
Long Island tea...
And a Stoli and tonic for me.

206
00:12:19,622 --> 00:12:22,834
Stupid cow.
Well, listen to this one.

207
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:24,884
After we did the Abba show,

208
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:27,672
Kevin had one of those liposuction
penis enlargements.

209
00:12:27,707 --> 00:12:29,232
He didn't?
Yep.

210
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:30,723
Know what they do?

211
00:12:30,758 --> 00:12:33,177
They siphon fat
from your love handles

212
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,263
and inject it into your wing-wang.

213
00:12:35,298 --> 00:12:36,771
Ugh! Yucky!

214
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:39,996
It gives a new meaning
to "cracking a fat", though.

215
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:43,152
Baaa-aaaa! Baaa-aaaa!

216
00:12:43,187 --> 00:12:47,984
Listen to yourselves! You sound like
two fat slags at a pie bake-off.

217
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:50,483
Well, your contribution
to the conversation

218
00:12:50,518 --> 00:12:52,947
hasn't exactly
made headlines, Bernice.

219
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:55,039
Gee, poor Kevin's dick.

220
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,458
There can't be much room down there

221
00:12:57,493 --> 00:13:00,621
with his brain taking up
so much space already.

222
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:03,840
No, I'll join this conversation

223
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:07,420
on the proviso that we stop
bitching about people,

224
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,440
talking about wigs,
dresses, bust sizes,

225
00:13:10,475 --> 00:13:13,391
penises, drugs, nightclubs
and bloody Abba!

226
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:16,971
Doesn't give us much
to talk about then, does it?

227
00:13:18,473 --> 00:13:21,184
Hey, can you confirm
a rumour for me?

228
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:23,895
Is it true her real name's Ralph?
Shh!

229
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:31,486
How do you like
your little boys, girls?

230
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,332
You don't have to answer that.

231
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:42,372
Oh, my God. What is this -
'Outback with Benny Hill'?

232
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:45,392
Just leave mine outside the door
at about 8am

233
00:13:45,427 --> 00:13:48,378
along with an orange juice
and toast, please.

234
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:50,261
Why, certainly, madam.

235
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:53,049
Would you like
vegemite or jam with that?

236
00:13:56,094 --> 00:13:59,228
Er... knock knock. Room service.

237
00:13:59,263 --> 00:14:02,224
Can't you read the sign -
"Do not disturb"?

238
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:05,186
Come back in the morning.
Ha ha. Open the door.

239
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:09,232
Goodnight, Bernice.
Goodnight, Mitzi.

240
00:14:10,274 --> 00:14:12,026
Open the fucking door!

241
00:14:15,697 --> 00:14:19,909
OK, if you don't open the door...
I'm gonna sing.

242
00:14:21,703 --> 00:14:24,163
Fine. You asked for it.

243
00:14:25,373 --> 00:14:28,313
I don't care
if the sun don't shine

244
00:14:28,348 --> 00:14:31,254
I get my loving
in the evening time

245
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:33,638
When I'm with my baby

246
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:36,724
It's no fun with the sun around

247
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:39,887
'Cause I get going
when the sun goes down

248
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:42,181
And I meet my baby...

249
00:14:43,725 --> 00:14:46,477
That's when we kiss
and kiss and kiss

250
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:48,528
And then we kiss some more

251
00:14:48,563 --> 00:14:50,982
Don't ask how many times...
Night, John-boy.

252
00:14:51,017 --> 00:14:53,067
Waaah!

253
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:58,114
I'm seriously falling asleep.

254
00:14:59,157 --> 00:15:01,874
It's your shift
and you're sticking to it.

255
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:04,579
Serves you right
for staying out all night... slut.

256
00:15:04,614 --> 00:15:06,254
Well, I won't make it.

257
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:09,042
I don't care
if the sun don't...

258
00:15:09,077 --> 00:15:10,585
Oh, fuck off, grandma.

259
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,468
You alright?

260
00:15:12,503 --> 00:15:14,776
Me? Yeah. I'm fine.

261
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:17,015
I'm just thinking.

262
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,143
Billy. Don't be a hero

263
00:15:20,178 --> 00:15:23,014
Don't be a fool with your life

264
00:15:25,308 --> 00:15:28,151
rBiWWy, don, t bdo a hdoro

265
00:15:28,186 --> 00:15:30,605
Come back
and make me your wife...

266
00:15:32,815 --> 00:15:36,743
And as Billy started to go

267
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:41,789
She said.
Keep your pretty head low

268
00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:44,535
Billy. Don't be a hero "...

269
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,246
"Cdomdo bacmk tdo mdo...

270
00:15:48,873 --> 00:15:50,625
Sorry.

271
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,342
Shit!

272
00:15:52,377 --> 00:15:54,545
What is it?

273
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,813
Perhaps we should've flown.

274
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,458
Bzzt! Wrong! But thanks for playing.

275
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:33,967
Anyone else?
No!

276
00:16:34,002 --> 00:16:36,427
Witchetty grub. Your turn.

277
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:40,383
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with 'R'.

278
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:42,517
Rectum.
No.

279
00:16:42,552 --> 00:16:44,595
Ring pirate.
No.

280
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,104
Road.

281
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,620
Alright, that's it.
What's the matter with you?

282
00:16:48,655 --> 00:16:51,609
Nothing, darling.
Don't 'darling' me, darling.

283
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:54,480
Look at you.
You've got a face like a cat's arse.

284
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,316
Now 'fess up.
Just... worried about the show.

285
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:59,492
We haven't done
any rehearsals yet...

286
00:16:59,527 --> 00:17:02,989
We've got two weeks!
There's plenty of time to rehearse.

287
00:17:03,024 --> 00:17:04,699
Now, what is your problem?

288
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:06,207
No problem. I just...

289
00:17:06,242 --> 00:17:08,960
I just want this show to be good.

290
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:11,587
How the fuck
did you get this job, Mitzi?

291
00:17:11,622 --> 00:17:15,793
Who is the fish that runs this hotel
in the middle of nowhere, anyway?

292
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:17,844
Your mother?
No, my wife.

293
00:17:17,879 --> 00:17:21,007
Ooh, don't tell me
you've got an ex-boyfriend

294
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:22,759
tucked away out here somewhere.

295
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:24,469
No, my WIFE!

296
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,263
I'm married.

297
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,517
Oh, fuck!

298
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:42,612
And when the joint bank account
ran dry after a couple of years...

299
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:48,576
...I guess I preferred her wedding
ring to mine, so... no drama.

300
00:17:48,611 --> 00:17:50,995
We swapped and called it a day.

301
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,956
This is getting too weird.

302
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,085
YOU and a woman.

303
00:17:58,252 --> 00:18:00,303
What did she do for kicks?

304
00:18:00,338 --> 00:18:03,799
Put a bucket on your head
and swing off the handle?

305
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:07,261
There are two things I don't like
about you, Felicia.

306
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:10,355
Your face! So how about shutting
both of them?

307
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,851
Well, at least this explains
your abysmal batting average, Mitz.

308
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:17,188
I often wondered
why your dance card was so empty.

309
00:18:17,223 --> 00:18:19,273
You never got a divorce, then?

310
00:18:22,193 --> 00:18:24,243
Well, girls, what can I say?

311
00:18:24,278 --> 00:18:26,829
Here's to a secret very well kept.

312
00:18:26,864 --> 00:18:29,582
Shame it won't stay that way,
isn't it?

313
00:18:29,617 --> 00:18:33,788
Mmm! Got any more little surprises
you'd like to share with us?

314
00:18:33,823 --> 00:18:37,250
Haven't got any kids
stashed away out there, have you?

315
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,222
Look...

316
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:46,092
...I haven't lied about anything.

317
00:18:48,136 --> 00:18:52,306
After six years I get phone call
out of nowhere, screaming for help,

318
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:55,059
and Christ knows
I owe her some favours.

319
00:18:58,396 --> 00:19:00,982
I'm sorry that I never told you.

320
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:05,028
I'm not sorry
that you're here.

321
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,703
Don't worry about it, dolls.

322
00:19:14,746 --> 00:19:16,831
I'm as jealous as all hell.

323
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,392
What?

324
00:19:29,427 --> 00:19:32,395
So, was it a big wedding?

325
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,480
Get lots of pressies, did you?

326
00:19:34,515 --> 00:19:37,643
I wish I was OLD enough
to have been there.

327
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,152
Oh, ha ha.

328
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:40,695
I would've bought you

329
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,524
a lovely matching set
of hers and hers bathmats.

330
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,117
Oh, give it a rest.
Not on your life!

331
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:50,302
Oh, imagine! Mitzi the magnificent
and her blushing bride.

332
00:19:50,337 --> 00:19:54,452
Mowing those lawns must've been
murder on your heels, though.

333
00:19:54,487 --> 00:19:56,336
Alright, Felicia. That's enough.

334
00:19:56,371 --> 00:20:00,166
Let's put some money in that seething
cesspool mouth of yours.

335
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:01,841
If I win this game,

336
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:05,922
you will NEVER mention my wife EVER
in my presence again, OK?

337
00:20:05,957 --> 00:20:08,675
And if I win?
Name your price.

338
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,516
Well, now...

339
00:20:10,551 --> 00:20:12,060
What would I like

340
00:20:12,095 --> 00:20:15,056
more than anything else
in the whole wide world?

341
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:16,648
Snap!

342
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:18,191
Better be quick.

343
00:20:18,226 --> 00:20:20,151
About being true

344
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:23,946
And all of the trouble
we've been through

345
00:20:23,981 --> 00:20:28,820
Oh, please don't talk
about all the plans we had

346
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:32,163
For fixing this broken romance

347
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:35,243
I want to go
where the people dance...

348
00:20:35,278 --> 00:20:37,293
What the fuck am I doing?

349
00:20:37,328 --> 00:20:41,833
Take that bloody frock off, Felicia -
don't make it worse than it is.

350
00:20:41,868 --> 00:20:45,294
Think I'll let YOU get
all the attention? No chance!

351
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:48,006
Come on, girls. Let's go shopping.

352
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,349
Oh, for Christ's sake!

353
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:55,013
I love the night-life
I've got to boogie

354
00:20:55,048 --> 00:20:59,013
On the disco
Ah-ha, oh, yeah

355
00:20:59,048 --> 00:21:02,979
Oh, I love the night-life

356
00:21:03,014 --> 00:21:05,029
I've got to boogie

357
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:09,235
On the disco
Ah-ha, oh, yeah...

358
00:21:09,444 --> 00:21:11,696
Oh, I just adore these hats!

359
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:16,200
Please don't talk
about love tonight

360
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:20,329
Your sweet talking
won't make it right

361
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:23,589
Loving lies
just bring me down

362
00:21:23,624 --> 00:21:27,337
When you've got women
all over town

363
00:21:27,372 --> 00:21:29,273
You can love them all

364
00:21:29,308 --> 00:21:31,096
And when you're through

365
00:21:31,131 --> 00:21:32,849
Maybe they'll make...

366
00:21:32,884 --> 00:21:35,685
You've got to be kidding!

367
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,139
Welcome to Mario Palace!

368
00:21:38,174 --> 00:21:40,099
Come in. Come in.

369
00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:42,692
Come in.

370
00:21:42,727 --> 00:21:44,624
What can I do for you?

371
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:46,522
You'd like a room, madam?

372
00:22:00,328 --> 00:22:01,836
Subtle.

373
00:22:01,871 --> 00:22:03,713
Oh, tackarama!

374
00:22:03,748 --> 00:22:06,090
Who does all the painting
around here?

375
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:10,046
Someone with no arms or right foot,
by the look of things.

376
00:22:10,081 --> 00:22:13,174
Ugh, for goodness sakes
get down off that crucifix!

377
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:15,694
Someone needs the wood.

378
00:22:15,729 --> 00:22:18,179
What have we here?!

379
00:22:20,098 --> 00:22:23,101
What fun! Baby bottles of booze!

380
00:22:23,136 --> 00:22:24,609
Oh!

381
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:27,772
Gather round, girls -
let me show you a trick.

382
00:22:27,807 --> 00:22:30,233
You, um, drink the gin...

383
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:36,162
Ah!

384
00:22:36,197 --> 00:22:39,617
...ah, fill the bottle with water
and... put it back.

385
00:22:39,652 --> 00:22:42,001
Va-t'en vous.
What about the Scotch?

386
00:22:42,036 --> 00:22:45,748
Ah... that's where the complimentary
tea bags come in handy.

387
00:22:45,783 --> 00:22:47,715
Very clever.
Cheers, girls.

388
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,795
And congratulations, Mitzi darling.
You did it.

389
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:53,840
One lap of the Broken Hill main drag
IN drag.

390
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,723
That'll teach you to take on

391
00:22:55,758 --> 00:22:58,031
the Fairmont Boys School
snap champion.

392
00:22:58,066 --> 00:23:00,304
Here's to being off the fucking bus.

393
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:02,188
Chookers.

394
00:23:02,223 --> 00:23:03,975
Chookers.
Chookers.

395
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:09,737
So... all dolled up
and nowhere to go.

396
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:13,568
I sure as shit am not going to sit
in here all evening.

397
00:23:13,603 --> 00:23:15,111
I'm in!

398
00:23:19,115 --> 00:23:20,623
Oh, alright.

399
00:23:20,658 --> 00:23:23,995
Here's hoping they have
a decent cocktail bar.

400
00:23:44,182 --> 00:23:45,690
Hello.

401
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:48,790
Could I please have
a Stoli and tonic,

402
00:23:48,825 --> 00:23:51,856
a bloody Mary
and a lime daiquiri, please?

403
00:23:52,982 --> 00:23:55,033
Well!

404
00:23:55,068 --> 00:23:58,654
Look what the cat dragged in!

405
00:24:00,156 --> 00:24:02,415
What have we got here, eh?

406
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,787
A couple of showgirls, have we?

407
00:24:07,622 --> 00:24:10,083
Where did you ladies come in from?

408
00:24:10,118 --> 00:24:11,626
Uranus?

409
00:24:12,794 --> 00:24:15,755
Could I please have a Stol...
No!

410
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,388
Ya can't have!

411
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:19,182
Ya can't have nothin'.

412
00:24:19,217 --> 00:24:23,054
We've got nothin' here
for people like you. Nothin'!

413
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:35,073
Now listen here, you mullet.

414
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:39,612
Why don't you just light your tampon
and blow your box apart?

415
00:24:39,647 --> 00:24:43,324
Because it's the only bang
you'll ever get, sweetheart!

416
00:25:00,258 --> 00:25:03,720
I get my loving
in the evening time

417
00:25:03,755 --> 00:25:07,449
When I'm with my baby

418
00:25:07,484 --> 00:25:11,109
Oh, it's no fun...

419
00:25:11,144 --> 00:25:14,153
What could be
more soothing

420
00:25:14,188 --> 00:25:20,236
than coming home after
a hard day's work down the mine

421
00:25:20,271 --> 00:25:23,621
to the wo-man in us all?

422
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:27,702
Now, don't send any money. OK?

423
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:35,918
Ooh!

424
00:25:45,553 --> 00:25:47,638
Ooh!

425
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,020
Oooooh!

426
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,535
OOOOH!

427
00:26:14,415 --> 00:26:16,292
Shit!

428
00:26:17,418 --> 00:26:21,547
All I can see
is female impersonators.

429
00:26:27,804 --> 00:26:30,188
This has got to be a first.

430
00:26:30,223 --> 00:26:32,732
Nobody's ever outdrunk
old Shirl before.

431
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:35,895
Where'd you learn
to throw 'em back like that?

432
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,403
That's our girl, Bernadette.

433
00:26:37,438 --> 00:26:41,109
Stumbling around the pub circuit
with Les Girls for 200 years

434
00:26:41,144 --> 00:26:42,742
must've taught her something.

435
00:26:42,777 --> 00:26:45,363
You're a bloody marvel,
Bernie.

436
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:47,914
Bernadette, please.
What's that?

437
00:26:47,949 --> 00:26:51,661
My name isn't Bernie.
She said her name isn't Bernie.

438
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:54,872
It's Ralph!

439
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:01,775
Come on! Oh!

440
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:04,465
Oh! Oh!

441
00:27:06,217 --> 00:27:10,013
What did you call me?
"What did you call me" what?

442
00:27:10,048 --> 00:27:13,433
What did you call me
back there in the bar?

443
00:27:13,468 --> 00:27:14,976
Sorry... Ralph!

444
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,751
You fucking idiot! Oh!

445
00:27:19,786 --> 00:27:21,948
Oh! Fuck!

446
00:27:21,983 --> 00:27:24,951
Oh! Fuckin'... Oh! Fuck!

447
00:27:24,986 --> 00:27:27,662
Get off me, you fuckin'... Oh!

448
00:27:27,697 --> 00:27:30,081
Don't worry.
It's only my fucken head!

449
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:33,411
At least the bump on your head's
bigger than your prick!

450
00:27:33,446 --> 00:27:36,330
Why don't you ust get fucked,
you stupid old fist?!

451
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:38,078
Oh, piss off, you little faggot!

452
00:27:38,113 --> 00:27:39,757
Listen, you're so bloody boring...

453
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:43,171
If your mouth was as big
as your dick...

454
00:28:02,273 --> 00:28:04,442
Good morning.
Morning.

455
00:28:06,235 --> 00:28:08,112
It's funny, you know.

456
00:28:09,364 --> 00:28:12,867
No matter how tough
I think I'm getting...

457
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:16,704
...it still hurts.

458
00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:21,758
Hope it still works.

459
00:28:21,793 --> 00:28:24,128
Don't have much call for it here.

460
00:28:24,163 --> 00:28:26,502
Where are you blokes from?

461
00:28:26,537 --> 00:28:28,841
Uranus.
Oh, good.

462
00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:35,598
Fish gotta swim
Birds gotta fly

463
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:39,227
I got to love one man
till I die...

464
00:28:39,262 --> 00:28:40,735
There! Left!

465
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:43,279
I hope you know what you're doing.

466
00:28:43,314 --> 00:28:47,819
If we stick to the sealed road
we'll be going another two days.

467
00:28:47,854 --> 00:28:51,114
Tell me he's lazy
Tell me he's slow...

468
00:28:51,149 --> 00:28:52,955
Take the short cut.

469
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:56,668
Tell me I'm crazy
Maybe I know

470
00:28:56,703 --> 00:29:01,916
Can't help lovin' that man
of mine.

471
00:29:46,377 --> 00:29:49,470
One more push,
I'll smack his face so hard

472
00:29:49,505 --> 00:29:53,593
he'll have to stick his toothbrush
up his arse to clean his teeth.

473
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,687
Just lay off!

474
00:29:57,722 --> 00:30:01,809
I said not to use the 'R' word.
What did you go and do?

475
00:30:01,844 --> 00:30:03,526
I was only having fun.
Fun?

476
00:30:03,561 --> 00:30:07,565
What else do you do for amusement -
slam your fingers in car doors?

477
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,073
What's the point?

478
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:12,035
It gives me a kick
seeing people get hot-headed.

479
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,990
Is it true when you were born
the doctor slapped your mother?

480
00:30:17,033 --> 00:30:20,495
What sort of... bent childhood
did you have, Adam Whitely?

481
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:23,915
Adam! Adam!

482
00:30:26,626 --> 00:30:28,336
Come in here, boy.

483
00:30:30,004 --> 00:30:31,756
Come and sit over here.

484
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:38,513
Would you like
to have some fun with Uncle Barry?

485
00:30:38,548 --> 00:30:40,807
We're gonna play a SPECIAL game,

486
00:30:40,842 --> 00:30:43,184
but you can't tell anybody

487
00:30:43,219 --> 00:30:47,153
ever, ever, ever, OK?

488
00:30:47,188 --> 00:30:50,983
Now, I want you
to put your hand down here

489
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:53,861
and pull very gently, OK?

490
00:30:54,904 --> 00:30:57,198
Very gently.

491
00:31:00,201 --> 00:31:02,870
That's good. That's good.

492
00:31:04,205 --> 00:31:05,713
Ooh!

493
00:31:05,748 --> 00:31:08,716
Jesus Christ, Adam!
Get help!

494
00:31:08,751 --> 00:31:13,006
Adam, Uncle Barry's penie-pie
is caught in the drain.

495
00:31:13,041 --> 00:31:15,014
Get Mummy. Get Mummy!

496
00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:18,393
No!
Whaddya mean 'no'?!

497
00:31:18,428 --> 00:31:21,305
Never, ever, ever!

498
00:31:23,266 --> 00:31:25,309
You know the best part?

499
00:31:25,344 --> 00:31:27,318
Mum was out playing golf

500
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:31,149
and the dirty old fuck
was stuck there for seven hours!

501
00:31:31,184 --> 00:31:33,401
I thought they were
small and wrinkled

502
00:31:33,436 --> 00:31:35,361
BEFORE they got in the water!

503
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:46,935
Hey, I've got a joke.

504
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,833
Who wants to hear a joke?

505
00:31:50,084 --> 00:31:51,592
Come on, Bernice,

506
00:31:51,627 --> 00:31:54,964
you'll laugh SO hard,
your lashes will curl by themselves.

507
00:31:54,999 --> 00:31:57,467
Do tell us your hilarious joke.

508
00:31:57,502 --> 00:31:59,058
OK.

509
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:02,061
Well, once upon a time,
many moons ago,

510
00:32:02,096 --> 00:32:06,225
there was a famous bunch of Indians
called the Fuck-are-we tribe.

511
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:10,355
One day, the son of the great
Indian chief says to his father,

512
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:14,233
"Dad, why is my friend Little Hawk
called Little Hawk?"

513
00:32:14,268 --> 00:32:15,742
And his father says...

514
00:32:15,777 --> 00:32:18,529
"Why do you ask... "
"Two Dogs Fucking?"

515
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:21,199
That's NOT the end of the joke.

516
00:32:21,234 --> 00:32:23,785
So anyway, back to me.

517
00:32:25,661 --> 00:32:27,712
Jesus!
What's happening?

518
00:32:27,747 --> 00:32:29,874
Um... I don't know.

519
00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:46,432
Oh, my God.

520
00:33:04,742 --> 00:33:06,709
Oh, Felicia.

521
00:33:06,744 --> 00:33:08,913
Where the fuck are we?

522
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:22,385
Shit! Shit! Shit!

523
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:39,694
Oh, shit!

524
00:33:44,157 --> 00:33:46,207
Well, I've had a look around

525
00:33:46,242 --> 00:33:49,996
and we can safely assume
that I now know less about motors

526
00:33:50,031 --> 00:33:53,750
than I did when I lifted up
that, uh... that bonnety thing.

527
00:33:53,785 --> 00:33:55,842
Now what?

528
00:33:55,877 --> 00:33:59,339
Let's not think about it yet
and eat brekkie, shall we?

529
00:33:59,374 --> 00:34:01,264
Oh, that's a novel idea.

530
00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:03,509
Let's stuff ourselves to death.

531
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:05,393
Imagine the headlines.

532
00:34:05,428 --> 00:34:08,431
'Whales beach themselves
in the outback'.

533
00:34:08,466 --> 00:34:10,805
'Mystery bumsticks dead in drag'.

534
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,109
There's no point walking back.

535
00:34:13,144 --> 00:34:15,855
The only life I've seen
is hypnotised bunnies

536
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:18,531
and they're now
mostly wedged in the tyres.

537
00:34:18,566 --> 00:34:22,160
Surely somebody will drive past.
We'll keep the fire burning.

538
00:34:22,195 --> 00:34:25,782
Yes, and toast marshmallows
and chill champagne for their arrival.

539
00:34:25,817 --> 00:34:27,832
What if they DON'T drive past?

540
00:34:27,867 --> 00:34:30,953
Look, you're not helping here.
Just eat your hormones.

541
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:33,671
"Help". Why didn't we stick
to the main road?

542
00:34:33,706 --> 00:34:37,460
What difference does it make?!
You started this, Anthony Belrose.

543
00:34:37,495 --> 00:34:40,178
Start thinking about
how to get us back

544
00:34:40,213 --> 00:34:44,050
or I don't fancy your chances
of being a husband again.

545
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:50,688
Jesus. What are we gonna do?

546
00:34:50,723 --> 00:34:53,066
We're gonna start
with a little face-lift.

547
00:34:53,101 --> 00:34:56,354
Nothing like a new frock
to brighten up your day.

548
00:34:59,649 --> 00:35:01,157
Purple?!

549
00:35:01,192 --> 00:35:04,112
It's not PURPLE. It's lavender.

550
00:35:04,147 --> 00:35:05,620
Whaddya think?

551
00:35:05,655 --> 00:35:09,033
Oh, it's nice...
in a hideous sort of a way.

552
00:35:10,493 --> 00:35:12,001
Where are you going?

553
00:35:12,036 --> 00:35:14,087
If you think I'm sitting around

554
00:35:14,122 --> 00:35:16,999
watching Picasso
take on the public transport system

555
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:18,925
you've got another thing coming.

556
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,345
I'll be back with the cavalry
in a few hours.

557
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,424
There goes a transsexual.
Last seen heading south.

558
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:28,469
We called her Bernie,
but her real name was...

559
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:30,013
Adam!

560
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:22,405
Cooee!

561
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,151
Cooee!

562
00:37:39,434 --> 00:37:42,061
Aaaggh!

563
00:38:22,977 --> 00:38:24,604
Oh!

564
00:38:25,646 --> 00:38:28,608
Help! Help!

565
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,506
What's that, Pa?
What?

566
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:33,327
Up there, yer nong.

567
00:38:33,362 --> 00:38:35,114
Looks like a woman!

568
00:38:35,149 --> 00:38:37,909
Help!

569
00:38:38,993 --> 00:38:41,829
Oh, thank God.

570
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:50,011
Thank you.

571
00:38:50,046 --> 00:38:52,799
I can't tell you how grateful I am.

572
00:38:54,175 --> 00:38:56,844
I just walked in
to find you here

573
00:38:56,879 --> 00:38:59,514
With that sad look
upon your face...

574
00:39:10,441 --> 00:39:11,984
You fucken beauty!

575
00:39:20,785 --> 00:39:22,835
Ooh, ooh, shit. Ooh.

576
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,790
Aaah! Bernie,
I'm so glad to see you!

577
00:39:25,825 --> 00:39:28,675
I wish I could say the same.

578
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:32,922
I was just drawing up the will.
Come and meet our saviours.

579
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:37,093
Tony, Adam,
this is Mr and Mrs Spencer.

580
00:39:37,128 --> 00:39:38,803
Hello!
Hello!

581
00:39:40,888 --> 00:39:43,307
Stop! Stop!

582
00:39:46,561 --> 00:39:49,147
Shit.

583
00:39:50,523 --> 00:39:52,824
Oh, for goodness sakes,
look at yourself, Mitz.

584
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:56,654
How many times do I have to tell you
green isn't your colour?

585
00:40:02,535 --> 00:40:05,038
Do you think about Trumpet much?

586
00:40:05,073 --> 00:40:06,581
No.

587
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:12,170
Trumpet was just a nice kid
who had a thing about transsexuals.

588
00:40:12,205 --> 00:40:13,720
Lots of people do.

589
00:40:13,755 --> 00:40:16,389
Sort of...
bent status symbol, you know.

590
00:40:16,424 --> 00:40:20,094
"My girlfriend used to be
a boyfriend" - that sort of thing.

591
00:40:20,129 --> 00:40:23,052
Always good for a supper invite.

592
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,975
Still... it was better than nothing.

593
00:40:28,498 --> 00:40:31,418
Nothing. Nothing for miles.

594
00:40:35,463 --> 00:40:38,556
Can you hear
the drums, Fernando...

595
00:40:38,591 --> 00:40:41,719
I've said it before
and I'll say it again.

596
00:40:41,754 --> 00:40:43,645
No more fuckin' Abba.

597
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,434
OK, we may as well
put the time to good use.

598
00:40:47,469 --> 00:40:49,894
Come on, girls. Off your snatches.

599
00:40:49,929 --> 00:40:51,403
Rehearsal time.

600
00:40:51,438 --> 00:40:52,946
Nah, nah, nah...

601
00:40:52,981 --> 00:40:55,483
And so you're back
From outer space...

602
00:40:55,518 --> 00:40:57,986
OK? Two bobs to start with, alright?

603
00:40:58,021 --> 00:41:00,412
Boring.
Ready?

604
00:41:00,447 --> 00:41:02,511
Da da da da

605
00:41:02,546 --> 00:41:04,541
Dee dee dee dee

606
00:41:04,576 --> 00:41:06,306
Dee dee dee dee dee dee

607
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:08,232
This look upon your face...

608
00:41:08,267 --> 00:41:10,088
Oh, I did this years ago.

609
00:41:10,123 --> 00:41:14,586
You did it SO beautifully
and darling, you do it SO well.

610
00:41:14,621 --> 00:41:16,963
Right, from the top.

611
00:41:16,998 --> 00:41:18,690
One, two...

612
00:41:18,725 --> 00:41:20,471
Go on, now go

613
00:41:20,506 --> 00:41:22,425
Walk out the door

614
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,310
Just turn around now

615
00:41:24,345 --> 00:41:26,896
'Cause you're not welcome anymore

616
00:41:26,931 --> 00:41:30,560
Weren't you the one who tried
to hurt me with goodbye...

617
00:41:30,595 --> 00:41:32,979
Aaaagh!

618
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,490
Hello.

619
00:41:37,525 --> 00:41:39,068
Nice night for it.

620
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:45,742
Well, I feel alright

621
00:41:45,777 --> 00:41:47,292
Feel alright

622
00:41:47,327 --> 00:41:51,296
Yes, I feel alright

623
00:41:51,331 --> 00:41:57,837
Well, I feel alright
with you right by my side...

624
00:42:18,983 --> 00:42:21,819
I think we just... crashed a party.

625
00:42:21,854 --> 00:42:24,656
No, come on.
You'll be right.

626
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,879
Welcome to my office. Have a seat.

627
00:42:52,225 --> 00:42:56,062
Bernice, what possibly possessed
you to wear THAT to a corroboree?

628
00:42:56,097 --> 00:42:57,647
Shut your face.

629
00:43:13,913 --> 00:43:16,666
Bravo!
Fabulous!

630
00:43:22,046 --> 00:43:25,300
Well, girls, I guess it's our turn.

631
00:43:32,474 --> 00:43:36,276
At first I was afraid
I was petrified

632
00:43:36,311 --> 00:43:40,238
Kept thinking I could never live
without you by my side

633
00:43:40,273 --> 00:43:44,694
But then I spent so many nights
thinking how you did me wrong

634
00:43:44,729 --> 00:43:46,453
And I grew strong

635
00:43:46,488 --> 00:43:48,830
And I learned how to get along

636
00:43:48,865 --> 00:43:51,791
And so you're back
From outer space

637
00:43:51,826 --> 00:43:56,831
I just walked in to find you here
with that sad look upon your face

638
00:43:56,866 --> 00:43:59,167
I should have changed
that stupid lock

639
00:43:59,202 --> 00:44:01,217
And made you leave your key

640
00:44:01,252 --> 00:44:05,215
If I'd known for just one second
you'd be back to bother me

641
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,098
Go on now go

642
00:44:07,133 --> 00:44:09,197
Walk out the door

643
00:44:09,232 --> 00:44:11,227
Just turn around now

644
00:44:11,262 --> 00:44:14,439
'Cause you're not welcome anymore

645
00:44:14,474 --> 00:44:18,081
Weren't you the one
who tried to hurt me with goodbye

646
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:21,689
Did you think I'd crumble
Think I'd lay down and die?

647
00:44:21,724 --> 00:44:23,688
Oh, no, not I

648
00:44:23,723 --> 00:44:25,617
I will survive

649
00:44:25,652 --> 00:44:30,038
As long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive

650
00:44:30,073 --> 00:44:34,244
I've got all my life to live
and I've got all my love to give

651
00:44:34,279 --> 00:44:38,123
And I'll survive
I will survive

652
00:44:38,158 --> 00:44:40,125
Hey, hey...

653
00:44:46,756 --> 00:44:48,383
Hey, take a look at that.

654
00:44:51,052 --> 00:44:54,687
Ooooh!
I've got an idea!

655
00:44:54,722 --> 00:44:58,817
It took all the strength I had
not to fall apart

656
00:44:58,852 --> 00:45:02,821
Just trying hard to mend the pieces
of my broken heart

657
00:45:02,856 --> 00:45:07,110
And I spent, oh, so many nights
just feeling sorry for myself

658
00:45:07,145 --> 00:45:11,281
I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high

659
00:45:11,316 --> 00:45:12,872
And you see me

660
00:45:12,907 --> 00:45:15,208
Somebody new

661
00:45:15,243 --> 00:45:19,414
I'm not that chained-up little
person still in love with you

662
00:45:19,449 --> 00:45:23,393
So you felt like dropping in
and just expect me to be free

663
00:45:23,428 --> 00:45:27,338
Now I'm saving all my lovin'
for someone who's lovin' me

664
00:45:27,373 --> 00:45:29,973
Go on now go

665
00:45:30,008 --> 00:45:31,850
Walk out the door

666
00:45:31,885 --> 00:45:36,723
Just turn around now 'cause
you're not welcome anymore...

667
00:45:40,685 --> 00:45:45,064
So... you actually make money
by dressing up like a woman?

668
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:49,444
Oh, sure. You can make
a fine living in a pair of heels.

669
00:45:49,479 --> 00:45:52,363
Why, Allen? Do you want a job?

670
00:46:01,831 --> 00:46:05,258
Oh! If only this dress could talk.

671
00:46:05,293 --> 00:46:08,129
Sometimes I wonder
where I get my taste.

672
00:46:08,164 --> 00:46:09,637
Definitely not my mother.

673
00:46:09,672 --> 00:46:13,468
Serves me right for letting her
buy me these awful clothes.

674
00:46:15,595 --> 00:46:17,138
What's this?

675
00:46:18,556 --> 00:46:22,727
That, darling, is my most treasured
possession in the whole wide world.

676
00:46:22,762 --> 00:46:24,778
But what is it?

677
00:46:24,813 --> 00:46:28,399
Once I went on a pilgrimage
backstage to an Abba concert,

678
00:46:28,434 --> 00:46:31,986
hoping to grab an audience
with Her Royal Highness, Agnetha.

679
00:46:32,021 --> 00:46:34,697
Well, when she ducked
into the ladies loo,

680
00:46:34,732 --> 00:46:36,372
naturally I followed her in...

681
00:46:36,407 --> 00:46:38,493
...and after
she'd finished her business

682
00:46:38,528 --> 00:46:40,210
I ducked into the cubicle

683
00:46:40,245 --> 00:46:44,040
only to find she'd left
a little gift in the toilet bowl.

684
00:46:44,075 --> 00:46:46,289
What are you telling me?

685
00:46:46,324 --> 00:46:48,503
This is an Abba turd?

686
00:46:52,173 --> 00:46:55,176
I know what we can do with THIS.

687
00:46:55,385 --> 00:46:57,720
Are you right?

688
00:46:57,755 --> 00:46:59,573
Hang on!

689
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,356
OK! Go!

690
00:47:01,391 --> 00:47:05,979
Whoo-hoo!

691
00:47:23,538 --> 00:47:25,832
There! Whoo-hoo!

692
00:47:54,944 --> 00:47:57,947
Afternoon.
What seems to be the problem?

693
00:48:03,328 --> 00:48:05,163
What a nice dog.

694
00:48:05,198 --> 00:48:06,998
What's its name?

695
00:48:07,033 --> 00:48:08,541
Herpes.

696
00:48:09,793 --> 00:48:12,337
If she's good, she'll heel.

697
00:48:14,547 --> 00:48:16,632
Things get pretty quiet around here.

698
00:48:16,667 --> 00:48:18,718
We're a bit starved
of entertainment.

699
00:48:18,753 --> 00:48:20,529
Glad we could oblige.

700
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,305
How does it look?

701
00:48:23,848 --> 00:48:26,566
Well, your gas tank's
chock-a-block full of crud.

702
00:48:26,601 --> 00:48:31,022
Travelling a rough road on
a low tank chucks it into the motor.

703
00:48:31,057 --> 00:48:34,293
Your fuel line's blocked,
injectors are stuffed...

704
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:37,529
So does that mean you can fix it?
In the short term.

705
00:48:37,564 --> 00:48:40,153
What you blokes need
is a new gas tank.

706
00:48:40,188 --> 00:48:42,742
Don't suppose
there's one lying around?

707
00:48:42,777 --> 00:48:44,375
No, sorry.

708
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:47,664
Could pick one up
in Coober Pedy in about a week.

709
00:48:47,699 --> 00:48:50,708
When do you have to be in Alice?
Six days.

710
00:48:51,751 --> 00:48:55,213
We can clear it out
and hope for the best.

711
00:48:55,248 --> 00:48:57,138
You might make it.

712
00:48:57,173 --> 00:48:59,488
Won't know unless you try.

713
00:48:59,523 --> 00:49:01,768
Refreshments!

714
00:49:01,803 --> 00:49:04,354
Lemonade here - I make!

715
00:49:04,389 --> 00:49:07,183
That's very nice, darling.
Please... go back inside.

716
00:49:07,218 --> 00:49:10,270
Lemonade here - I make.
Lemonade for guests.

717
00:49:10,305 --> 00:49:12,956
No, darling, please!

718
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:15,608
I make chockrit cracker!

719
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,912
Thank you!

720
00:49:20,947 --> 00:49:22,455
We put cream on?

721
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:24,909
Er... no, no.
It's... um... face cream.

722
00:49:24,944 --> 00:49:27,293
It's for face.
Ah!

723
00:49:27,328 --> 00:49:30,477
Bob, Cynthia - thank you.

724
00:49:30,512 --> 00:49:32,924
I love lamb with meringue.

725
00:49:32,959 --> 00:49:35,301
Thank you for the company.

726
00:49:35,336 --> 00:49:39,090
Like I said, new faces
are hard to come by here.

727
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:41,714
What were you doing
off the highway?

728
00:49:41,749 --> 00:49:44,269
Oh, now,
that's a bloody good question.

729
00:49:44,304 --> 00:49:48,099
Glad you bothered. Don't get
your type out here very often.

730
00:49:49,142 --> 00:49:52,771
Me like to sing too - me like...
Yeah, pretty damn quiet.

731
00:49:52,806 --> 00:49:55,071
Thought about opening
a video business,

732
00:49:55,106 --> 00:49:58,234
but I suppose we gotta wait
for television first.

733
00:49:58,269 --> 00:50:00,618
Me perform for you. Me dance too.

734
00:50:00,653 --> 00:50:03,865
My wife was in the, uh...
entertainment business.

735
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,416
Yeah. You perform here?

736
00:50:06,451 --> 00:50:08,168
You thinking of performing here?

737
00:50:08,203 --> 00:50:11,254
I mean, you'll be here
at least another night.

738
00:50:11,289 --> 00:50:15,147
Um... well, the thought
hadn't really... crossed my mind.

739
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:19,325
Well, I'll talk to Wally at the pub.
Everybody would love it.

740
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:23,468
Oh, I'm not sure our show
would go down too well out here.

741
00:50:24,886 --> 00:50:27,138
What kind of cabaret do you do?

742
00:50:27,173 --> 00:50:29,355
We dress up in women's clothes

743
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:33,103
and parade around mouthing the words
to other people's songs.

744
00:50:33,138 --> 00:50:36,564
You mean, sort of like them...
what are they called?

745
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:38,073
Les Girls?

746
00:50:38,108 --> 00:50:41,569
Yeah, I've seen 'em in Sydney
when I was young!

747
00:50:41,604 --> 00:50:43,203
Fantastic! Just terrific!

748
00:50:43,238 --> 00:50:49,285
Bob, you are looking at probably the
most famous Les Girl ever produced!

749
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,212
You're kidding me!
Give me a break.

750
00:50:52,247 --> 00:50:55,215
I was never that famous.
I'm not joking.

751
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:58,524
What? I mean,
I wouldn't have seen you, but...

752
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,798
That was 30 years back.
Oh, you'd be surprised.

753
00:51:01,833 --> 00:51:03,848
Me perform for you. Me sing...!

754
00:51:03,883 --> 00:51:06,928
No, Cynthia. You no perform.
They perform, not you.

755
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,104
Well! A real live Les Girls show.

756
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:18,648
Right, this calls for a celebration.

757
00:51:22,819 --> 00:51:26,204
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
Oh, shut your twat.

758
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:29,721
Our frocks were the sensation
of Broken Hill, remember?

759
00:51:29,756 --> 00:51:33,204
Broken Hill had a K-Mart.
They knew what a frock was.

760
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:35,547
Christ, you should see
this woman's dress.

761
00:51:35,582 --> 00:51:39,043
It's not a frock.
It's a piece of corrugated iron!

762
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:45,633
Can I come in?
Only if you're single!

763
00:51:51,598 --> 00:51:54,601
Oh, you look, uh... incredible.

764
00:51:54,636 --> 00:51:56,276
Where did we find him?

765
00:51:56,311 --> 00:51:58,188
Keep dishing out
the compliments, Bob.

766
00:51:58,223 --> 00:51:59,738
Flattery gets you everywhere.

767
00:51:59,773 --> 00:52:02,073
Now, where's
that lovely wife of yours?

768
00:52:02,108 --> 00:52:05,862
She's at home. She's, uh...
not allowed in the pub anymore.

769
00:52:05,897 --> 00:52:08,329
Really? Why?

770
00:52:08,364 --> 00:52:12,869
Alcohol problem - when she's in
the pub she makes a fool of herself.

771
00:52:12,904 --> 00:52:14,996
I know how she feels.

772
00:52:16,956 --> 00:52:20,210
Well, we're all waiting.
Are you ready?

773
00:52:20,245 --> 00:52:22,552
Bob...

774
00:52:22,587 --> 00:52:25,180
...we're having second thoughts.

775
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:28,600
You can't back out.
Every man and his dog's here.

776
00:52:28,635 --> 00:52:32,138
They're not chained up are they?
Oh, you blokes!

777
00:52:32,173 --> 00:52:33,730
Sorry. You girls.

778
00:52:33,765 --> 00:52:36,434
You'll be fine.
Take my word for it.

779
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:15,536
There's nothing more
that I'd like to do

780
00:53:15,571 --> 00:53:19,102
Than take the floor
and dance with you

781
00:53:19,137 --> 00:53:27,402
Keep dancing
Let's keep dancing

782
00:53:31,906 --> 00:53:34,325
Shake it! Shake it!

783
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:41,589
Shake it! Shake it!

784
00:53:41,624 --> 00:53:45,503
Shake your groove thing
Shake your groove thing, yeah, yeah!

785
00:53:46,629 --> 00:53:51,217
Show them how to do it now
Show them how to do it now!

786
00:53:51,252 --> 00:53:52,761
YEAH!

787
00:53:55,972 --> 00:53:57,515
Yeah, right.

788
00:54:00,477 --> 00:54:03,521
Here she goes!

789
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,084
