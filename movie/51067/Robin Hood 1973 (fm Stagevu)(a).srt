Well, we folks of the animal kingdom

You're taking too many chances.

Chances?
You must be joking.

Did you lose it?

- Where did you come from?
- Oh, please don't tell Prince John.

Oh, don't be afraid.
You've done nothing wrong.

Oh, Marian,
what a bonny wee bunny.

Who does this young archer
remind you of?

Well, upon my word,
the notorious Robin Hood.

That's right. Only Robin Hood
wears a hat like that.

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Yeah, and look at this keen
Robin Hood bow.

- That's Maid Marian.

Hey, you guys, not so fast.
Wait for me.

I told Skippy
he was shooting too high.

I'm so very glad he did.
Now I get to meet all of you.

- Gee, you're very beautiful.
- Are you gonna marry Robin Hood?

are sweethearts.

Well, um--
[ Laughs ]

334

You see, that was several years ago
before I left for London.

- Did he ever kiss you?
- Well, uh, no.

But he carved our initials
on this tree.

- I remember it so well.
- You gonna have any kids?

My mom gots
a lot of kids.

Oh, he's probably
forgotten all about me.

Oh, not Robin Hood.

off to Sherwood Forest.

You've forgotten Prince John.
