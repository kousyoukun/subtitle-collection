1
00:04:17,586 --> 00:04:21,037
Welcome to Gattaca.

2
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,400
You keep your work station
so clean, Jerome.

3
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:26,465
It's next to godliness.

4
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,032
- Isn't that what they say?
- "Godliness."

5
00:05:29,911 --> 00:05:34,871
I reviewed your flight plan.
Not one error in a million keystrokes.

6
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:38,385
Phenomenal. It's right that
someone like you...

7
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:40,216
is taking u s to Titan.

8
00:05:40,288 --> 00:05:43,314
Has the committee
approved the mission?

9
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:45,154
There's been talk of delay.

10
00:05:45,226 --> 00:05:47,626
You shouldn't listen to talk.

11
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:50,186
You leave in a week.

12
00:05:50,264 --> 00:05:52,960
You've got a substance test.

13
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:26,359
lf you have been notified
for substance analysis...

14
00:06:26,434 --> 00:06:28,561
please report
to the testing center.

15
00:06:37,912 --> 00:06:39,846
Never shy.
Pisses on command.

16
00:06:41,616 --> 00:06:44,346
I ever tell you that's
a beautiful piece of equipment?

17
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:46,046
Every time I'm here.

18
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:48,948
Occupational hazard.

19
00:06:49,023 --> 00:06:51,685
I see many in the course of any day.

20
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,057
Yours happens to be
an exceptional example.

21
00:06:55,863 --> 00:06:58,730
I don't know why my folks
didn't order one like that for me.

22
00:07:12,447 --> 00:07:15,575
By the way...

23
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,118
have I told you about my son?

24
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:21,280
- No, you haven't.
- Remind me to sometime.

25
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:26,119
So you're about to go up.

26
00:07:26,194 --> 00:07:28,594
One week left.

27
00:07:28,663 --> 00:07:30,597
Please tell me you're excited.

28
00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:36,327
I'll tell you
at the end of the week.

29
00:07:48,716 --> 00:07:50,650
Congratulations, Jerome.

30
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:54,750
Thank you.

31
00:07:57,758 --> 00:08:01,091
How many launches are there
in a day? A dozen?

32
00:08:03,364 --> 00:08:05,298
Sometimes more.

33
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:09,001
You're the only one
who watches them all.

34
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:17,406
If you're going to pretend
like you don't care, don't look up.

35
00:08:19,914 --> 00:08:21,973
The most unremarkable
of events.

36
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,685
Jerome Morrow,
navigator first class...

37
00:08:25,753 --> 00:08:29,484
is about to embark on a one-year
manned mission to Titan...

38
00:08:29,557 --> 00:08:31,582
the 14th moon of Saturn.

39
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:35,661
A highly prestigious assignment.
Although for Jerome...

40
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,222
selection was
virtually guaranteed at birth.

41
00:08:40,468 --> 00:08:43,869
He 's blessed with all the gifts
required for such an undertaking.

42
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:46,429
A genetic quotient
second to none.

43
00:08:47,408 --> 00:08:49,899
No, there is truly
nothing remarkable...

44
00:08:49,977 --> 00:08:52,070
about the progress
of Jerome Morrow.

45
00:08:53,147 --> 00:08:56,344
Except that
I am not Jerome Morrow.

46
00:09:05,426 --> 00:09:08,088
I was conceived
in the Riviera.

47
00:09:08,162 --> 00:09:11,598
Not the French Riviera,
the Detroit variety.

48
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:16,626
They used to say that
a child conceived in love...

49
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:18,831
has a greater chance of happiness.

50
00:09:19,941 --> 00:09:21,909
They don 't say that anymore.

51
00:09:24,712 --> 00:09:27,704
I'll never understand what possessed
my mother to put her faith...

52
00:09:27,782 --> 00:09:30,842
in God's hands rather than
those of her local geneticist.

53
00:09:34,488 --> 00:09:37,457
Ten fingers, ten toes.
That 's all that used to matter.

54
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:41,120
Not now.
Now, only seconds old...

55
00:09:41,195 --> 00:09:45,222
the exact time and cause
of my death was already know.

56
00:09:50,171 --> 00:09:53,334
Neurological condition :
60% probability.

57
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,001
Manic depression :
42% probability.

58
00:09:56,077 --> 00:09:59,979
Attention deficit disorder:
89% probability.

59
00:10:00,047 --> 00:10:01,014
Heart disorder--

60
00:10:03,284 --> 00:10:05,275
99% probability.

61
00:10:05,353 --> 00:10:07,287
Early fatal potential.

62
00:10:07,355 --> 00:10:10,483
Life expectancy: 30.2 years.

63
00:10:12,093 --> 00:10:14,027
Thirty years.

64
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:15,925
The name?

65
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:18,625
- Anton.
- No!

66
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:20,633
Vincent Anton.

67
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,737
Yeah. That's a good name.

68
00:10:28,843 --> 00:10:30,777
I know he'll do something.

69
00:10:37,518 --> 00:10:41,978
From an early age l came to think
of myself as others thought of me.

70
00:10:42,056 --> 00:10:44,991
Chronically ill.
Every skinned knee and runny nose...

71
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:47,391
was treated like
it was life-threatening.

72
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:49,986
I'm sorry.
The insurance won't cover it.

73
00:10:50,064 --> 00:10:52,191
- If he fell--
- I was told everything--

74
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:54,826
I wish there was
something I could do.

75
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:06,213
Like most parents of their day...

76
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,272
they were determined that
their next child would be born...

77
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,183
in what has become
the natural way.

78
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:17,384
Your extracted eggs, Marie...

79
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:22,589
have been fertilized
with Antonio's sperm.

80
00:11:22,663 --> 00:11:26,258
After screening, we are
left with two healthy boys...

81
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:28,495
and two very healthy girls.

82
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:32,869
Naturally, no critical predispositions
to any major inheritable diseases.

83
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,068
All that remains is to select
the most compatible candidate.

84
00:11:37,378 --> 00:11:40,836
First, we let's decide on gender.
Have you given it any thought?

85
00:11:40,915 --> 00:11:44,112
We would want Vincent
to have a brother, you know...

86
00:11:44,185 --> 00:11:46,176
to play with.

87
00:11:46,253 --> 00:11:47,413
Of course.
Hello, Vincent.

88
00:11:50,324 --> 00:11:54,761
You have specified hazel eyes,
dark hair and fair skin.

89
00:11:56,497 --> 00:11:59,864
I've taken the liberty of eradicating
any potentially prejudicial conditions.

90
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:02,095
Premature baldness, myopia...

91
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:04,535
alcoholism and
addictive susceptibility...

92
00:12:04,605 --> 00:12:06,573
propensity for violence,
obesity, etc.

93
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,371
We didn't want--
Diseases, yes, but--

94
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:15,211
We were just wondering if it's good
to leave a few things to chance?

95
00:12:15,282 --> 00:12:18,649
You want to give your child
the best possible start.

96
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:21,244
Believe me, we have enough
imperfection built in already.

97
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:25,122
Your child doesn't need
any additional burdens.

98
00:12:25,192 --> 00:12:27,456
Keep in mind
this child is still you.

99
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:29,792
Simply the best of you.

100
00:12:30,531 --> 00:12:34,365
You could conceive naturally a thousand
times and never get such a result.

101
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:40,334
That 's how my brother, Anton,
came into the world.

102
00:12:40,408 --> 00:12:43,502
A son my father considered
worthy of his name.

103
00:12:57,658 --> 00:12:59,990
What did I tell you?
See how he's grown?

104
00:13:15,409 --> 00:13:17,639
By the time we were
playing at blood brothers...

105
00:13:17,711 --> 00:13:21,875
I understood that there was something
different flowing through my veins...

106
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:24,349
and I'd need
more than a drop...

107
00:13:24,418 --> 00:13:26,352
if l was going to get anywhere.

108
00:13:48,008 --> 00:13:50,374
Our favorite game was chicken.

109
00:13:50,444 --> 00:13:53,811
When our parents weren't watching,
we 'd swim out as far as we dared.

110
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:57,510
It was about who would get scared
and turn back first.

111
00:14:12,466 --> 00:14:14,434
Come on, you coward !

112
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:19,596
Of course,
it was always me.

113
00:14:19,673 --> 00:14:22,198
Anton was by far
the stronger swimmer...

114
00:14:22,276 --> 00:14:24,437
and he had no excuse
to fail.

115
00:14:33,487 --> 00:14:35,751
Maybe it was the love of the planets...

116
00:14:35,823 --> 00:14:38,792
or my growing dislike for this one.

117
00:14:38,859 --> 00:14:42,886
But for as long as l can remember,
I have dreamed of going into space.

118
00:14:42,963 --> 00:14:47,366
700 million. 750 million.
800 million.

119
00:14:47,434 --> 00:14:49,095
850 million.

120
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,935
How many astronauts are there?

121
00:14:54,008 --> 00:14:56,306
I bet I could be one
if I wanted.

122
00:14:56,377 --> 00:14:58,845
Don't eat that.
It's Pluto.

123
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:06,580
My goals didn't change a lot
in the intervening years...

124
00:15:06,654 --> 00:15:09,214
much to my parents' dismay.

125
00:15:17,231 --> 00:15:21,429
You have to be realistic.
With your heart condition--

126
00:15:21,502 --> 00:15:25,461
Mom, there's a chance there's
nothing wrong with my heart.

127
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:26,699
One in a hundred.

128
00:15:28,742 --> 00:15:31,404
- I'll take it.
- The trouble is, they won't.

129
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:34,344
Listen. For God's sake...

130
00:15:34,415 --> 00:15:36,349
you gotta understand something.

131
00:15:43,023 --> 00:15:46,515
The only way you'll see the inside
of a spaceship is to clean it.

132
00:15:47,595 --> 00:15:49,426
My father was right.

133
00:15:49,496 --> 00:15:52,192
It didn't matter how much
I lied on my resume.

134
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:55,201
My real resume
was in my cells.

135
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:58,568
Why should anybody invest
all that money to train me...

136
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,099
when there are a thousand other
applicants with a far cleaner profile?

137
00:16:03,177 --> 00:16:05,737
Of course, it's illegal
to discriminate.

138
00:16:05,813 --> 00:16:08,008
"Genoism," it's called.

139
00:16:08,082 --> 00:16:10,880
But no one
takes the law seriously.

140
00:16:17,992 --> 00:16:19,960
lf you refuse to disclose...

141
00:16:20,027 --> 00:16:24,327
they can always take a sample
from a door handle or a handshake...

142
00:16:24,398 --> 00:16:27,390
even the saliva
on your application form.

143
00:16:28,869 --> 00:16:32,532
lf in doubt, a legal drug test
can just as easily become...

144
00:16:32,606 --> 00:16:35,837
an illegal peek
at your future in the company.

145
00:16:44,652 --> 00:16:47,951
You sure you wanna do this?
You know you're gonna lose.

146
00:16:58,832 --> 00:17:01,164
It was the last time
we swam together...

147
00:17:01,235 --> 00:17:03,260
and out into the open sea...

148
00:17:03,337 --> 00:17:06,306
like always, knowing each stroke
to the horizon...

149
00:17:06,373 --> 00:17:09,308
was one we'd have to
make back to the shore.

150
00:17:22,523 --> 00:17:25,822
But something was very different
about that day.

151
00:17:25,893 --> 00:17:27,952
Every time Anton
tried to pull away...

152
00:17:28,028 --> 00:17:30,292
he found me right beside him.

153
00:17:33,934 --> 00:17:36,960
Until finally,
the impossible happened.

154
00:17:55,389 --> 00:17:58,085
It was the one moment
in our lives that my brother...

155
00:17:58,158 --> 00:18:02,424
was not as strong as he believed
and l was not as weak.

156
00:18:02,496 --> 00:18:05,488
It was the moment that made
everything else possible.

157
00:18:49,643 --> 00:18:51,634
Like many in my situation...

158
00:18:51,712 --> 00:18:55,113
I moved around in the next few years,
getting work where l could.

159
00:18:56,483 --> 00:18:59,077
I must've cleaned
half the toilets in the state.

160
00:19:00,454 --> 00:19:02,513
I belonged to a new underclass...

161
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:06,150
no longer determined
by social status or skin color.

162
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:09,795
- Welcome to Gattaca, gentlemen.
- No.

163
00:19:09,863 --> 00:19:13,060
We now have discrimination
down to a science.

164
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:15,363
There's your cleaning material.

165
00:19:15,435 --> 00:19:17,903
Start from the front,
clean all the way back.

166
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:23,042
And I wanna see my smiling face
on that floor.

167
00:19:31,885 --> 00:19:34,911
What about you, Your Majesty?
You dreaming of space?

168
00:19:36,456 --> 00:19:38,390
Come here.

169
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:45,430
You can start by
cleaning this space right here.

170
00:19:48,302 --> 00:19:52,295
I was never more certain of
how far away l was from my goal...

171
00:19:52,372 --> 00:19:54,602
than when l was
standing right beside it.

172
00:21:06,914 --> 00:21:09,382
When you clean the glass,
don't clean it too well.

173
00:21:09,449 --> 00:21:11,246
What do you mean?

174
00:21:11,318 --> 00:21:13,786
You might get ideas.

175
00:21:13,854 --> 00:21:17,847
But if it's clean, it'll be easier to
see me when I'm on the other side of it.

176
00:22:10,344 --> 00:22:13,336
For all my brave talk,
I knew it was just that.

177
00:22:13,413 --> 00:22:16,314
No matter how much l trained
or how much l studied...

178
00:22:16,383 --> 00:22:20,717
the best test score wouldn't matter
without the blood test to go with it.

179
00:22:22,489 --> 00:22:26,357
I made up my mind to resort
to more extreme measures.

180
00:22:26,426 --> 00:22:28,656
The man who
showed up at my doorstep...

181
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:31,493
didn't exactly advertise
in the Yellow Pages.

182
00:22:31,565 --> 00:22:33,499
Stand straight.

183
00:22:35,202 --> 00:22:37,762
- How did you hear about me?
- People.

184
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:43,075
Any distinguishing marks?
Tattoos, scars, birthmarks?

185
00:22:43,143 --> 00:22:46,078
No. I don't think so.

186
00:22:47,614 --> 00:22:51,175
You're serious about this?
I hope you 're not wasting my time.

187
00:22:51,251 --> 00:22:53,685
No, I'd give 1 00% .

188
00:22:54,855 --> 00:22:57,915
That'll get you halfway there.

189
00:22:57,991 --> 00:23:02,189
That's an old edition,
but I know it all by heart.

190
00:23:03,063 --> 00:23:04,997
By heart?

191
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,468
You realize the commitment
is binding.

192
00:23:10,737 --> 00:23:12,204
You have somebody?

193
00:23:33,693 --> 00:23:37,823
For the genetically superior,
success is easier to attain...

194
00:23:37,898 --> 00:23:39,866
but is by no means guaranteed.

195
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:44,131
After all, there is no gene for fate.

196
00:23:44,204 --> 00:23:46,502
And when,
for one reason or another...

197
00:23:46,573 --> 00:23:49,565
a member of the elite
falls on hard times...

198
00:23:49,643 --> 00:23:54,307
their genetic identity becomes a
valued commodity for the unscrupulous.

199
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:57,043
One man's loss is another man 's gain.

200
00:23:57,117 --> 00:23:59,085
His credentials are impeccable.

201
00:23:59,152 --> 00:24:01,177
An expiration date
you wouldn't believe.

202
00:24:06,893 --> 00:24:09,088
The guy's practically
gonna live forever.

203
00:24:09,162 --> 00:24:11,960
He's got an I.Q. off the register.

204
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,762
Better than 20/20 in both eyes.

205
00:24:14,835 --> 00:24:17,895
And the heart of an ox.
He could run through a wall.

206
00:24:23,276 --> 00:24:25,210
If he could still run.

207
00:24:27,114 --> 00:24:31,141
Actually, he was
a big-time swimming star.

208
00:24:33,186 --> 00:24:36,815
You could go anywhere with this guy's
helix tucked under your arm.

209
00:24:40,894 --> 00:24:45,058
What did I tell you? You look so right
together I wanna double my fee.

210
00:24:45,132 --> 00:24:47,623
- We don't look anything alike.
- It's close enough.

211
00:24:47,701 --> 00:24:49,999
When was the last time anybody
looked at a photograph?

212
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,937
You could have my face on your name tag,
for Christ's sake.

213
00:24:53,006 --> 00:24:56,237
- How do I explain the accident?
- That's the beautiful thing.

214
00:24:56,309 --> 00:24:58,641
It happened out of the country.

215
00:24:58,712 --> 00:25:02,170
There's no record he broke his back.
As far as anyone's concerned...

216
00:25:02,249 --> 00:25:05,776
he's still a walking, talking,
fully-productive member of society.

217
00:25:05,852 --> 00:25:09,151
You just have to get him clean
and fill in the last year of hi s life.

218
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,721
You're a foreigner.

219
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:14,692
They don 't care
where you were born, just how.

220
00:25:14,761 --> 00:25:17,594
Blood has no nationality.

221
00:25:17,664 --> 00:25:20,155
As long as it's got
what they're looking for...

222
00:25:20,233 --> 00:25:22,292
it's the only passport you need.

223
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,603
Who lives up there?

224
00:25:26,106 --> 00:25:28,040
I certainly don't.

225
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:33,846
So began the process
of becoming Jerome.

226
00:25:33,914 --> 00:25:38,476
Myopia is one of the most obvious
signs of a disadvantaged birth.

227
00:25:38,552 --> 00:25:40,520
Isn't there another way?

228
00:25:40,587 --> 00:25:43,488
Surgery's no good.
They'll see the scars.

229
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:46,425
It's contact lenses or a white cane.

230
00:25:47,827 --> 00:25:51,558
Besides, the color doesn't match.

231
00:25:51,631 --> 00:25:54,623
He's right.
My eyes are prettier.

232
00:25:58,171 --> 00:26:01,072
You understand
I take 25% of everything you make.

233
00:26:01,141 --> 00:26:06,443
If it doesn't work out, this equipment
must be returned within seven days.

234
00:26:06,513 --> 00:26:08,777
And you don't get your deposit back.

235
00:26:08,848 --> 00:26:11,976
- I thought you said 20%.
- He told me 20%.

236
00:26:12,052 --> 00:26:14,043
- Twenty percent.
- It's not negotiable.

237
00:26:29,135 --> 00:26:30,625
I guess that's it.

238
00:26:31,404 --> 00:26:32,666
Not quite.

239
00:26:32,739 --> 00:26:35,572
- Why? What?
- There's still the matter of height.

240
00:26:36,476 --> 00:26:38,876
- How tall are you?
- 4'6".

241
00:26:38,945 --> 00:26:40,936
How tall were you
before the accident?

242
00:26:41,014 --> 00:26:44,211
Unfortunately,
his profile says he's 6'1 ".

243
00:26:46,086 --> 00:26:47,075
I'll wear lifts.

244
00:26:48,688 --> 00:26:51,179
Even with lifts,
you're not that tall.

245
00:26:53,827 --> 00:26:55,761
So, what?

246
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,099
We never discussed that.

247
00:27:09,175 --> 00:27:11,143
I thought you were serious.

248
00:27:11,211 --> 00:27:13,577
I am. I'm not doing that.

249
00:27:19,719 --> 00:27:20,708
I won't.

250
00:27:27,193 --> 00:27:30,026
Jerome never
questioned my commitment again.

251
00:27:30,096 --> 00:27:33,088
I took my mind off the pain
by reminding myself...

252
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:39,002
that when l eventually did stand up
I'd be two inches closer to the stars.

253
00:27:39,072 --> 00:27:41,506
You all right?

254
00:27:41,574 --> 00:27:43,508
Yeah.

255
00:27:45,845 --> 00:27:47,938
Wanna go dancing?

256
00:27:49,516 --> 00:27:52,178
You had to be a right-hander.

257
00:27:52,252 --> 00:27:54,982
I guess no one orders
southpaws anymore.

258
00:27:56,523 --> 00:27:57,455
Jerome Morrow.

259
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:01,693
It's a nice name.

260
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:07,333
- It's my name.
- I can't be you without it.

261
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,800
What makes you think
you can be me at all?

262
00:28:19,446 --> 00:28:21,380
Look at this.

263
00:28:22,782 --> 00:28:24,716
Look at it.

264
00:28:25,485 --> 00:28:27,419
It's nice.

265
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:30,455
I'm impressed. Is it real?

266
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:33,919
Are you colorblind too?

267
00:28:33,993 --> 00:28:35,688
- It's silver.
- So?

268
00:28:35,762 --> 00:28:39,823
Jerome Morrow was never meant
to be one step down on the podium.

269
00:28:41,468 --> 00:28:43,402
With all I had going for me...

270
00:28:44,371 --> 00:28:46,305
I was still second best.

271
00:28:48,675 --> 00:28:50,609
Me.

272
00:28:51,678 --> 00:28:54,272
So how do you expect
to pull this off?

273
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:58,483
I don't know exactly.

274
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,924
Your signature needs work.

275
00:29:06,993 --> 00:29:10,224
It soon came time to put
our preparations to the test.

276
00:29:10,296 --> 00:29:14,062
Jerome was engineered with everything
needed to get into Gattaca...

277
00:29:14,134 --> 00:29:17,103
except the desire to do so.

278
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,104
Do you really wanna be in there?

279
00:29:19,172 --> 00:29:22,573
I don't wanna be in there.
I wanna be up there.

280
00:29:24,944 --> 00:29:25,876
What's up there?

281
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,214
That's what I wanna find out, Jerome.

282
00:29:31,618 --> 00:29:33,552
Call me Eugene.

283
00:29:34,554 --> 00:29:36,488
My middle name.

284
00:29:37,791 --> 00:29:40,760
If you're gonna be Jerome,
you better start getting used to it.

285
00:29:51,404 --> 00:29:53,099
Where's my sample?

286
00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:55,232
In the refrigerator!
Door on the left!

287
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,542
Which pouch?

288
00:29:58,611 --> 00:30:00,238
Oh, any of them.

289
00:30:03,783 --> 00:30:05,250
Should I test it?

290
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:08,253
If you like!

291
00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:18,757
- What's wrong with the machine?
- Nothing!

292
00:30:18,832 --> 00:30:20,959
It's a hot sample.
You've been drinking again.

293
00:30:21,034 --> 00:30:24,526
- I haven't!
- Christ, it's 8:00 in the morning !

294
00:30:24,604 --> 00:30:26,128
I haven't!

295
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:36,207
This is no joke!
My interview is in an hour!

296
00:30:42,589 --> 00:30:45,990
There is more vodka in this piss
than there is piss!

297
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:49,961
I'm sorry.
I had half a glass to celebrate.

298
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:52,862
Try Friday's.
That one will be okay.

299
00:30:52,932 --> 00:30:56,390
- There's only Wednesday left.
- That's the one.

300
00:31:08,848 --> 00:31:11,908
Listen. It's not too late
to back out.

301
00:31:15,855 --> 00:31:19,256
This is the last day you're gonna be you
and I'm gonna be me.

302
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,927
Well?

303
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,525
Congratulations.

304
00:31:57,263 --> 00:32:00,164
Well, what about the interview?

305
00:32:00,233 --> 00:32:02,633
That was it.

306
00:32:10,843 --> 00:32:12,003
I got it.

307
00:32:13,947 --> 00:32:15,881
Of course you got it.

308
00:32:25,792 --> 00:32:27,783
And that's the way it was.

309
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:32,797
Daily, l disposed of as much loose skin,
fingernails and hair as possible...

310
00:32:32,865 --> 00:32:38,064
to limit how much of my In-Valid self
I would leave in the Valid world.

311
00:32:44,577 --> 00:32:49,014
Meanwhile, Eugene prepared samples of
his own superior body matter...

312
00:32:49,082 --> 00:32:51,050
so that l might pass for him.

313
00:32:51,117 --> 00:32:54,518
Customized urine pouches
for the frequent substance tests...

314
00:32:54,587 --> 00:32:58,523
fingertip blood sachets
for security checks...

315
00:32:58,591 --> 00:33:01,287
vials filled with other traces.

316
00:33:02,295 --> 00:33:05,662
While Eugene supplied me
with a new identity, l paid the rent...

317
00:33:05,732 --> 00:33:09,133
and kept him in the style
to which he'd become accustomed.

318
00:33:10,436 --> 00:33:13,997
Eugene never suffered from the routine
discrimination of a "utero"...

319
00:33:14,073 --> 00:33:17,099
''faith birth '' or ''In-Valid''
as we were called.

320
00:33:17,176 --> 00:33:22,512
A ''Valid, '' a ''vitro, '' a ''made man,
he suffered under a different burden.

321
00:33:22,582 --> 00:33:24,209
The burden of perfection.

322
00:33:26,352 --> 00:33:28,616
I was now a member
of a relatively new...

323
00:33:28,688 --> 00:33:32,089
and particularly detested
segment of society.

324
00:33:32,158 --> 00:33:35,787
One of those who refuses
to play the hand that he was dealt.

325
00:33:35,862 --> 00:33:40,925
I am most commonly known
as a ''borrowed ladder'' or...

326
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,867
a ''de-gene-erate. ''

327
00:33:48,441 --> 00:33:50,739
In the guise of Jerome Morrow...

328
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:53,540
I have risen quickly
through the ranks of Gattaca.

329
00:33:53,613 --> 00:33:56,081
Only one of the mission directors
has ever come close...

330
00:33:56,149 --> 00:33:58,947
to discovering my true identity.

331
00:33:59,018 --> 00:34:02,715
Strange to think, he may have more
success exposing me in death...

332
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:05,622
than he ever did in life.

333
00:34:17,704 --> 00:34:19,968
We apologize for any inconvenience.

334
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,911
- I think we can rule out suicide.
- Excuse me?

335
00:34:30,983 --> 00:34:32,917
Nothing.

336
00:34:33,953 --> 00:34:35,352
Thank you.

337
00:34:38,124 --> 00:34:41,855
This will take a while.
We might have to push things back.

338
00:34:55,475 --> 00:35:00,139
Irene, I want you to
assist the investigators.

339
00:35:00,213 --> 00:35:02,238
My work, Director.
That would put me behind.

340
00:35:02,315 --> 00:35:04,340
I appreciate your sacrifice.

341
00:35:06,552 --> 00:35:08,918
Will you see that
I don't lose my place in line?

342
00:35:08,988 --> 00:35:11,422
Your place is assured.

343
00:35:11,491 --> 00:35:13,982
So, will you kindly inform
the authorities...

344
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,359
that we will cooperate
in any way...

345
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:20,797
although we can't tolerate
a major disruption.

346
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:22,926
- Director--
- Thank you.

347
00:35:23,536 --> 00:35:24,696
Thank you.

348
00:35:28,241 --> 00:35:30,641
How will this affect the mission?

349
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:33,838
We're still going ahead
as planned.

350
00:35:33,913 --> 00:35:36,746
The launch window's only open
until week's end...

351
00:35:36,816 --> 00:35:40,718
and tragic though
this event may be...

352
00:35:40,787 --> 00:35:44,917
it hasn't stopped
the planets' turning, has it?

353
00:35:55,802 --> 00:35:58,362
- What happened?
- I'm going up.

354
00:35:59,138 --> 00:36:01,072
When?

355
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,199
End of the week.

356
00:36:04,644 --> 00:36:06,703
That soon?

357
00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:09,543
What about the mission director?

358
00:36:11,217 --> 00:36:12,707
He's dead.

359
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,112
Are you serious?

360
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:22,793
He was found in his office today beaten
so badly they had to check his name tag.

361
00:36:24,564 --> 00:36:26,964
You are serious.

362
00:36:27,033 --> 00:36:28,091
So that's it.

363
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:31,398
There's nothing between us
and ignition.

364
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,969
I'm going up.

365
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:40,101
- The man was murdered.
- So? I didn't do it.

366
00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:43,444
I didn't say you did, but the place
is gonna be crawling with Hoovers.

367
00:36:43,516 --> 00:36:47,145
I'll take my chances with the
"J. Edgars" over the mission director.

368
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:51,987
Besides, what if they do find something?
I'll be out of their jurisdiction.

369
00:36:57,864 --> 00:36:59,923
We have to get drunk immediately.

370
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,068
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- I hope our table's ready.

371
00:37:10,142 --> 00:37:13,168
- I understand you're leaving us.
- Looks that way.

372
00:37:13,246 --> 00:37:15,874
- We're going to miss you.
- You've opened the wine, I hope?

373
00:37:15,948 --> 00:37:19,440
- Of course, sir.
- Pour yourself a glass, Cavendish.

374
00:37:19,518 --> 00:37:20,644
Thank you, sir.

375
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,470
How old?

376
00:37:45,544 --> 00:37:47,478
- Me?
- The specimen.

377
00:37:47,546 --> 00:37:50,481
I kissed him five minutes ago.
A real good one.

378
00:37:51,784 --> 00:37:54,184
I'll see what I can do.

379
00:37:58,324 --> 00:38:00,884
- You want the full sequence?
- Yes.

380
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,018
Thank you.

381
00:38:03,396 --> 00:38:05,591
Good luck.

382
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,672
Some samples may be consumed
in the sequencing process.

383
00:38:22,448 --> 00:38:24,939
9.3. Quite a catch.

384
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:29,884
Yes. Quite a catch.

385
00:38:56,082 --> 00:38:59,017
How many times have I told Cavendish?

386
00:38:59,085 --> 00:39:02,384
This can't have been opened
more than five minutes ago!

387
00:39:02,455 --> 00:39:05,151
A wine like this needs to breathe.
Remember that.

388
00:39:05,224 --> 00:39:07,818
You know, they say
when you're weightless...

389
00:39:09,261 --> 00:39:11,991
it's the closest thing
to being in the womb.

390
00:39:15,434 --> 00:39:18,232
I can't believe
you pulled this off.

391
00:39:18,304 --> 00:39:20,772
They're sending you up there.

392
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,331
Up there, for Christ's sake.
You, of all people.

393
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:25,707
I hate to think of you
alone in that room for a year.

394
00:39:25,778 --> 00:39:27,939
Don't think about it.
Anyway...

395
00:39:28,014 --> 00:39:30,812
the room I'm stuck in
is bigger than your tin can.

396
00:39:30,883 --> 00:39:33,147
You know what I'm saying.
What are you gonna do?

397
00:39:34,387 --> 00:39:36,947
I have my books.
I go places in my head.

398
00:39:38,324 --> 00:39:40,815
- I'd be happier if you had company.
- I have visitors!

399
00:39:40,893 --> 00:39:44,659
- None that you don't pay.
- I wouldn't have it any other way.

400
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:48,359
Seriously,
what are you gonna do?

401
00:39:50,503 --> 00:39:52,562
I'm gonna finish this.

402
00:40:05,518 --> 00:40:07,543
What's Titan like
this time of year?

403
00:40:10,956 --> 00:40:12,719
What's Titan like?

404
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:15,454
Titan is exactly like this.

405
00:40:27,673 --> 00:40:29,607
All the time.

406
00:40:29,675 --> 00:40:33,907
It's got a cloud around it so thick
nobody can tell what's underneath.

407
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,714
Maybe there's nothing there.

408
00:40:37,883 --> 00:40:40,010
There's something there.

409
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,524
You should be going
instead of me.

410
00:40:48,861 --> 00:40:50,158
Why?

411
00:40:51,464 --> 00:40:53,728
Because up there
your legs wouldn't matter.

412
00:41:00,806 --> 00:41:02,740
I'm scared of heights.

413
00:41:23,496 --> 00:41:25,430
I'm sorry!

414
00:41:26,398 --> 00:41:30,300
Do you want this?
I'll save some for you, shall l?

415
00:41:39,812 --> 00:41:42,713
- I'm really sorry.
- You're not that sorry.

416
00:41:47,987 --> 00:41:51,445
Don't give me a hard time.
Give me a break.

417
00:41:54,226 --> 00:41:55,989
Come on !

418
00:41:56,061 --> 00:41:58,552
- I'm sorry.
- Help!

419
00:42:08,874 --> 00:42:09,806
I wasn't drunk.

420
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:13,777
- What do you mean?
- When I walked in front of that car.

421
00:42:14,547 --> 00:42:16,174
What car?

422
00:42:16,248 --> 00:42:18,546
I stepped right out
in front of it.

423
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:22,314
I'd never been more sober
in my life.

424
00:42:25,324 --> 00:42:28,122
- Go to sleep.
- Couldn't even get that right.

425
00:42:29,495 --> 00:42:34,023
"If at first you don't succeed,
try, try again."

426
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:36,033
Go to sleep.

427
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,274
I'm proud of you, Vincent.

428
00:42:47,379 --> 00:42:49,904
You must be drunk
to call me Vincent.

429
00:43:30,489 --> 00:43:32,753
- How much do you need?
- Twenty minutes.

430
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,714
You can go.

431
00:44:02,855 --> 00:44:04,789
It's all right, Irene.
You're excused.

432
00:44:29,415 --> 00:44:34,478
We found our man. It's the only
specimen we can't account for.

433
00:44:34,553 --> 00:44:36,612
Every ten years or so,
things go our way.

434
00:44:36,689 --> 00:44:39,180
The eyelash?
What do you know about him?

435
00:44:39,258 --> 00:44:41,385
He's an unregistered In-Valid.

436
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,896
He was a janitor here until
a few years back when he disappeared.

437
00:44:44,963 --> 00:44:47,227
So the specimen could have
been here since then.

438
00:44:47,299 --> 00:44:51,099
Take a look at the floor.
Nothing lays around here for very long.

439
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:55,800
And motive? Would a janitor come back
to kill a man he never knew?

440
00:44:55,874 --> 00:44:58,342
His profile does suggest
a violent temperament.

441
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:02,904
If I'm not mistaken, it also
suggests that he's a sick man.

442
00:45:02,981 --> 00:45:06,849
There's a 90%% chance the owner of this
eyelash has died of natural causes.

443
00:45:06,919 --> 00:45:10,878
Then there's a ten percent chance he's
alive. It's a lost-and-found case, sir.

444
00:45:10,956 --> 00:45:14,551
We find the man who's lost an eyelash,
we have the murderer.

445
00:45:14,626 --> 00:45:16,753
I'll do a cross check,
find out about his family--

446
00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:20,424
I've already run it. There's no record
of any living relative.

447
00:45:20,499 --> 00:45:21,932
That's a damn shame, sir.

448
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,800
Check the entry log,
alibis, grudges.

449
00:45:25,871 --> 00:45:27,805
I look around,
I see a lot of dry eyes.

450
00:45:27,873 --> 00:45:31,775
The mission director
was not universally loved.

451
00:45:32,678 --> 00:45:34,737
He was leading the cutbacks
in the program.

452
00:45:35,781 --> 00:45:37,715
With all due respect, sir--

453
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,178
Whatever you say.

454
00:45:59,505 --> 00:46:02,474
Jerome, Jerome,
the metronome.

455
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:04,736
I could play the piano
by that heartbeat of his.

456
00:46:07,179 --> 00:46:10,615
Mr. Director, you will be pleased
to know we have a suspect.

457
00:46:10,682 --> 00:46:12,809
That is a relief.
Who is it?

458
00:46:12,885 --> 00:46:17,686
We found an unaccounted for specimen
in the south wing. Here's his picture.

459
00:46:19,658 --> 00:46:22,923
- An In-Valid.
- We are still following other leads.

460
00:46:22,995 --> 00:46:26,624
Be that as it may,
I'm having this posted immediately.

461
00:46:26,698 --> 00:46:27,596
I'm curious.

462
00:46:28,567 --> 00:46:33,527
An advantage, I should imagine,
in your line of work.

463
00:46:33,605 --> 00:46:36,199
Your hiring practices.

464
00:46:36,275 --> 00:46:38,800
Our recruitment philosophy.

465
00:46:38,877 --> 00:46:41,038
Who do you have to be
to be here?

466
00:46:41,113 --> 00:46:45,675
Naturally, our standard is beyond
that of the common citizen.

467
00:46:45,751 --> 00:46:49,016
Even amongst your people, you must
have varying levels of excellence.

468
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:53,649
Occasionally we've had to accept
candidates with minor shortcomings...

469
00:46:53,725 --> 00:46:57,161
but nothing that would prohibit
someone from working in a field...

470
00:46:57,229 --> 00:47:00,687
such as law enforcement,
for example.

471
00:47:00,766 --> 00:47:04,634
But now there are enough
of the right kind of people...

472
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:07,501
to warrant a new measuring stick.

473
00:47:07,573 --> 00:47:09,598
Bodies with minds to match.

474
00:47:09,675 --> 00:47:14,669
Essential as we push out further
and further.

475
00:47:14,746 --> 00:47:16,839
Yet you still
closely monitor performance.

476
00:47:16,915 --> 00:47:20,146
We have to ensure that people
are meeting their potential.

477
00:47:20,219 --> 00:47:22,983
- And exceeding it.
- No one exceeds his potential.

478
00:47:23,055 --> 00:47:24,181
If he did?

479
00:47:24,256 --> 00:47:28,056
It would simply mean we did not
accurately gauge him in the first place.

480
00:47:41,573 --> 00:47:43,507
- Are you all right?
- Terrific.

481
00:48:09,134 --> 00:48:11,329
This is the entry log
for the last seven days.

482
00:48:14,673 --> 00:48:16,140
What about you?

483
00:48:17,142 --> 00:48:18,473
Do you have an alibi?

484
00:48:19,845 --> 00:48:22,939
- I was alone.
- I find that hard to believe.

485
00:48:23,815 --> 00:48:25,112
Excuse me.

486
00:48:34,326 --> 00:48:36,419
I'll take care of that.

487
00:48:50,909 --> 00:48:54,709
I see I'm not the only one who
looks up every time there's a launch.

488
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,748
- Hello.
- Hello.

489
00:48:59,618 --> 00:49:02,018
It's awful about the director.

490
00:49:02,087 --> 00:49:04,146
Awful it didn't happen sooner.

491
00:49:06,058 --> 00:49:09,425
Didn't the director threaten to
cancel your mission more than once?

492
00:49:09,494 --> 00:49:12,395
- Yes. he did.
- Somebody did you a favor.

493
00:49:12,464 --> 00:49:14,694
Do they have any idea whose hand
I should be shaking?

494
00:49:14,766 --> 00:49:17,234
They found an eyelash
in the south wing.

495
00:49:17,302 --> 00:49:20,135
- Does it have a name?
- Just some In-Valid.

496
00:49:27,512 --> 00:49:30,504
I had you sequenced.
I read your profile.

497
00:49:32,184 --> 00:49:33,674
I'm sorry.

498
00:49:37,322 --> 00:49:39,722
Seems you're everything
they say you are and more.

499
00:49:42,594 --> 00:49:46,655
What about you? You're engineered
just like the rest of us.

500
00:49:47,366 --> 00:49:48,890
Not quite.

501
00:49:50,302 --> 00:49:53,032
"Un acceptable likelihood
of heart failure."

502
00:49:53,105 --> 00:49:55,164
I think that's what the manual says.

503
00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:00,041
The only trip I'll take in space is
around the sun on the satellite here.

504
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:04,977
If there's anything wrong with you,
I can't see it from here.

505
00:50:09,488 --> 00:50:11,422
If you don't believe me--

506
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:17,760
Here. Take it.

507
00:50:26,071 --> 00:50:28,266
If you're still interested,
let me know.

508
00:50:32,711 --> 00:50:34,975
I'm sorry.
The wind caught it.

509
00:51:12,484 --> 00:51:16,147
Is this the approach path
that we discussed?

510
00:51:19,191 --> 00:51:20,818
Absolutely, Director.

511
00:51:21,893 --> 00:51:23,827
Quite right.

512
00:51:39,444 --> 00:51:41,378
Listen to what I'm saying to you.

513
00:51:41,446 --> 00:51:43,676
I want what I ordered.

514
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:47,378
It's a completely different color.

515
00:51:47,452 --> 00:51:49,750
Now, I'm bored of talking to you.

516
00:51:49,821 --> 00:51:52,085
I'm bored.
I'll call you back.

517
00:51:54,326 --> 00:51:56,817
That was the company
that sent us your hair dye.

518
00:51:56,895 --> 00:51:59,830
They sent me ''summer wheat"
instead of "honey dawn."

519
00:51:59,898 --> 00:52:02,230
Any fool knows
it's two shades lighter.

520
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,393
She said.
"Why don't you try a change?"

521
00:52:04,469 --> 00:52:06,403
We can't use a change.

522
00:52:07,773 --> 00:52:11,300
Now I'm probably gonna have to pay
for the five boxes they've sent me.

523
00:52:11,376 --> 00:52:12,809
We can't stay here.

524
00:52:12,878 --> 00:52:15,278
Idiots I have to deal with,
you wouldn't believe.

525
00:52:15,347 --> 00:52:17,747
They think I killed
the mission director.

526
00:52:19,851 --> 00:52:24,151
- What makes them think that?
- They found my eyelash.

527
00:52:25,557 --> 00:52:26,990
Where?

528
00:52:27,058 --> 00:52:28,923
In the corridor.

529
00:52:28,994 --> 00:52:32,191
Well, it could be worse.
They could've found it in your eye.

530
00:52:32,264 --> 00:52:34,789
They've got my picture
plastered up all over the place.

531
00:52:35,534 --> 00:52:38,332
I can't turn around
without seeing my own face.

532
00:52:39,371 --> 00:52:43,307
- They'll recognize me.
- They won't recognize you.

533
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:46,811
I don't recognize you !
They won't marry the eyelash to you.

534
00:52:46,878 --> 00:52:49,346
They won't believe
that one of their elite...

535
00:52:49,414 --> 00:52:51,712
could have suckered them
all this time.

536
00:52:51,783 --> 00:52:54,047
No, no, no.
We change nothing.

537
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:55,586
We do as we planned.

538
00:52:55,654 --> 00:52:58,179
You're Jerome Morrow.
navigator first class.

539
00:52:58,256 --> 00:53:00,656
I'm not Jerome Morrow.

540
00:53:00,725 --> 00:53:02,852
I'm a murder suspect.

541
00:53:02,928 --> 00:53:05,294
What are you doing?

542
00:53:05,363 --> 00:53:07,456
That's more than a day's work!

543
00:53:07,532 --> 00:53:10,160
- Wait.
- We can't stay here.

544
00:53:10,235 --> 00:53:12,169
Stop that!

545
00:53:12,237 --> 00:53:14,364
Oh. fine!

546
00:53:14,439 --> 00:53:18,603
You leave if you want,
but you're not taking that stuff.

547
00:53:18,677 --> 00:53:20,611
That stuff is mine!

548
00:53:21,947 --> 00:53:25,383
I could've rented myself out
to somebody with a spine...

549
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:29,477
if I'd known you were going to go
belly-up on me at the last gasp.

550
00:53:30,488 --> 00:53:32,786
You can't quit on me now.

551
00:53:32,858 --> 00:53:36,658
I've put too much into this.
What do you want me to do?

552
00:53:36,728 --> 00:53:39,663
Wheel in there
and finish the job myself?

553
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,830
They're going to find me.

554
00:53:46,037 --> 00:53:47,971
You still don't understand, do you?

555
00:53:51,076 --> 00:53:53,636
When they look at you,
they don't see you anymore.

556
00:53:53,712 --> 00:53:55,304
They only see me.

557
00:54:10,161 --> 00:54:13,096
Keep your lashes on your lids
where they belong.

558
00:54:15,066 --> 00:54:17,500
How could you be so careless?

559
00:54:50,268 --> 00:54:52,099
I'm going out.

560
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:54,195
Where are you going?

561
00:54:54,272 --> 00:54:57,537
If I'm gonna get arrested tomorrow,
I'm gonna go out tonight.

562
00:54:57,609 --> 00:55:00,737
- You sure that's a good idea?
- Well, it was your idea...

563
00:55:00,812 --> 00:55:02,973
not to change anything.

564
00:55:03,048 --> 00:55:06,017
- Who's going?
- Just everybody.

565
00:55:07,385 --> 00:55:08,909
Everybody.

566
00:55:08,987 --> 00:55:11,421
If I don't go,
it'll look suspicious.

567
00:55:13,325 --> 00:55:15,657
You don't want
to look suspicious, do you?

568
00:55:20,432 --> 00:55:22,059
Thanks.

569
00:56:21,659 --> 00:56:23,627
Who ordered this?

570
00:56:23,695 --> 00:56:25,959
What are we doing here?

571
00:56:26,031 --> 00:56:28,864
I'm following a lead.
Forgive me, but that's what I do.

572
00:56:28,933 --> 00:56:31,128
I'm a detective.
I follow leads.

573
00:56:31,202 --> 00:56:34,365
What makes you think
the owner of the eyelash is here?

574
00:56:34,439 --> 00:56:38,466
He's an In-Valid, sir. Where do we look
for In-Valids but where In-Valids are?

575
00:56:38,543 --> 00:56:40,306
He's an In-Valid?

576
00:56:41,846 --> 00:56:45,509
He's an In-Valid clever enough
to go unregistered all these years.

577
00:56:45,583 --> 00:56:48,211
Do you think he's likely
to lie down for us now?

578
00:56:48,286 --> 00:56:51,016
- Well, what would you suggest?
- Move the inquiry...

579
00:56:51,089 --> 00:56:52,522
back to the scene.

580
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:55,684
Draw a five-mile radius around Gattaca,
sweep again, random stops.

581
00:57:18,349 --> 00:57:21,318
You're a navigator?
At Gattaca?

582
00:57:21,386 --> 00:57:23,547
That's what it says, doesn't it?

583
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:27,224
It doesn't say you're crippled.

584
00:57:27,992 --> 00:57:29,789
I'm not crippled.

585
00:57:29,861 --> 00:57:32,762
I hurt my leg training, you moron.

586
00:57:33,832 --> 00:57:35,766
How dare you question me?

587
00:57:35,834 --> 00:57:37,199
Yeah, right.

588
00:57:37,268 --> 00:57:40,396
- What's your number?
- All right, forget it.

589
00:57:40,472 --> 00:57:43,066
What's your number,
you fucking flatfoot?

590
00:57:43,141 --> 00:57:45,769
I said forget it.
What do you want, an apology?

591
00:57:45,844 --> 00:57:47,402
It gets to you, doesn't it?

592
00:57:47,479 --> 00:57:50,448
It gets to you that I can do
what you can only dream of!

593
00:57:50,515 --> 00:57:54,679
I'm getting off this ball of dirt!
How dare you question me?

594
00:57:54,752 --> 00:57:57,516
- That's harassment.
- My mistake.

595
00:57:57,589 --> 00:57:59,523
What's your number?

596
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:04,961
May I remind you
that this is a crime scene?

597
00:58:05,029 --> 00:58:07,088
What's this man doing here?

598
00:58:07,165 --> 00:58:11,101
- What are you doing, old man?
- Doing my job, sir.

599
00:58:12,403 --> 00:58:15,839
- This is evidence.
- But it's just trash.

600
00:59:08,693 --> 00:59:10,661
You didn't know?

601
00:59:10,728 --> 00:59:13,788
- Oh, yes.
- Wonderful. wasn't it?

602
00:59:15,633 --> 00:59:18,431
Twelve fingers or one,
it's how you play.

603
00:59:19,671 --> 00:59:22,606
That piece can only
be played with 12.

604
00:59:40,358 --> 00:59:42,292
What's all this about?

605
00:59:44,128 --> 00:59:46,062
It's probably nothing.

606
01:00:23,868 --> 01:00:27,269
You better not. I don't want to give you
a contaminated specimen.

607
01:00:28,406 --> 01:00:30,340
Get my meaning?

608
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:01,231
Thanks.

609
01:01:01,306 --> 01:01:04,241
You never know
where those swabs have been.

610
01:01:06,144 --> 01:01:08,738
I want to show you something.

611
01:01:54,792 --> 01:01:56,851
Come on !
We'll miss it!

612
01:02:24,789 --> 01:02:27,019
Come on.
We'll miss it.

613
01:03:14,372 --> 01:03:16,306
What did I tell you?

614
01:03:37,295 --> 01:03:39,320
- Strange.
- What?

615
01:03:39,397 --> 01:03:43,333
- Your eyes look different.
- I guess it must be the light.

616
01:03:44,869 --> 01:03:46,302
Must be.

617
01:04:08,493 --> 01:04:10,654
Positive match .

618
01:04:10,728 --> 01:04:12,320
I'm impressed.

619
01:04:13,598 --> 01:04:16,089
The cup was definitely used
since the original sweep?

620
01:04:17,068 --> 01:04:19,002
Two samples. Two days.

621
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:23,666
Either the suspect returned to the scene
of the crime to get a drink of water...

622
01:04:23,741 --> 01:04:25,436
or he still works there.

623
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:28,274
I thought we checked
all the service staff.

624
01:04:28,346 --> 01:04:30,610
I don't think he cleans up
the place anymore.

625
01:04:30,681 --> 01:04:33,946
I have a feeling he might be there
under false pretenses.

626
01:04:34,018 --> 01:04:37,476
A borrowed ladder?
At Gattaca?

627
01:04:37,555 --> 01:04:40,718
It's far-fetched,
but it's not impossible.

628
01:04:40,791 --> 01:04:43,954
I find it hard to believe
he could be one of their elite workers.

629
01:04:44,028 --> 01:04:47,395
He wouldn't have the mental faculty
or the physical stamina.

630
01:04:47,465 --> 01:04:49,399
Maybe you're underestimating him.

631
01:04:49,467 --> 01:04:52,630
Maybe he is an impostor,
and maybe the director found out.

632
01:04:52,703 --> 01:04:57,367
That could be his motive. Let's sample
every internal employee intravenously.

633
01:04:57,441 --> 01:05:00,376
Two-thirds of their work force
fall under that category.

634
01:05:00,444 --> 01:05:04,403
We'd close them down for days. A
fingertip or urine sample is sufficient.

635
01:05:04,482 --> 01:05:09,419
I suggest blood from the vein.
I hope I'm not out of line.

636
01:05:37,548 --> 01:05:41,279
It's only a matter of time, sir.

637
01:05:44,789 --> 01:05:47,087
What's with the plungers, Lamar?

638
01:05:49,827 --> 01:05:51,761
You open up a blood bank?

639
01:05:51,829 --> 01:05:55,595
The gentlemen of law enforcement
are concerned...

640
01:05:55,666 --> 01:05:59,500
that my testing methods
may have been compromised.

641
01:06:11,882 --> 01:06:14,248
- Goddamn !
- I'm sorry.

642
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:16,946
- Are you out of practice?
- Here, let me look at that.

643
01:06:17,021 --> 01:06:18,454
It's all right.

644
01:06:20,024 --> 01:06:22,754
Luckily, it looks as though
we have enough.

645
01:06:22,827 --> 01:06:26,388
If you need more, you can always
get it off his shoes.

646
01:06:47,585 --> 01:06:49,519
So you didn't do it, after all .

647
01:06:51,889 --> 01:06:53,823
I guess somebody beat me to it.

648
01:06:53,891 --> 01:06:55,483
I guess.

649
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:03,994
I leave in two days.

650
01:07:07,204 --> 01:07:09,434
I guess you know that.

651
01:07:09,507 --> 01:07:10,940
But--

652
01:07:23,821 --> 01:07:25,686
That's the last.

653
01:07:26,824 --> 01:07:30,123
- Something's not right.
- He's not here.

654
01:07:30,194 --> 01:07:33,686
No, we missed something.
I say we test again.

655
01:07:33,764 --> 01:07:36,130
Test? I cannot allow you...

656
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,963
to disrupt operations any further.

657
01:07:38,035 --> 01:07:40,902
You're not concerned about having
a murderer in your midst?

658
01:07:40,971 --> 01:07:44,429
Right now your presence
is creating more of a threat.

659
01:07:44,508 --> 01:07:47,477
The window for our latest launch
is open for seven days...

660
01:07:47,545 --> 01:07:49,479
once every 70 years...

661
01:07:49,547 --> 01:07:51,811
so it's rather crucial
we leave on time.

662
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:55,680
The mission means a great deal
to you, doesn't it?

663
01:07:55,753 --> 01:07:59,280
And your late colleague
opposed it, didn't he?

664
01:07:59,356 --> 01:08:02,325
Take another look
at my profile, Detective.

665
01:08:02,393 --> 01:08:05,362
You won't find a violent bone
in my body.

666
01:08:05,429 --> 01:08:08,921
My apologies, Director.
We won't trouble you any further.

667
01:08:10,701 --> 01:08:13,636
This is not the only place
we can look.

668
01:08:17,875 --> 01:08:20,503
Let's start making our rounds.

669
01:09:21,906 --> 01:09:26,172
I'm luckier than most.
Not as lucky as some.

670
01:09:28,646 --> 01:09:30,978
- I know something about that.
- You, Jerome?

671
01:09:31,682 --> 01:09:34,583
What heart problem
did you ever have?

672
01:09:34,652 --> 01:09:36,745
Did you get yours broken once?

673
01:09:41,725 --> 01:09:43,693
I had this crazy idea...

674
01:09:45,095 --> 01:09:48,030
that you were more interested
in the murder case than me.

675
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:50,232
You're right.

676
01:09:53,604 --> 01:09:55,299
That's a crazy idea.

677
01:09:58,876 --> 01:10:00,434
Would you like to dance?

678
01:10:38,315 --> 01:10:40,078
It's funny.

679
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:41,640
You work so hard...

680
01:10:41,719 --> 01:10:45,519
and you do everything you can
to get away from a place...

681
01:10:45,589 --> 01:10:48,524
and when you finally
get your chance to leave...

682
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:51,987
you find a reason to stay.

683
01:10:57,735 --> 01:10:59,828
A year is a long time.

684
01:11:01,505 --> 01:11:05,498
Not so long.
Just once around the sun.

685
01:11:14,818 --> 01:11:16,251
Hello, everyone!

686
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:20,188
I'm your detective for the evening.
Please don't leave the premises.

687
01:11:22,626 --> 01:11:25,288
I said nobody leave!
Am I speaking...

688
01:11:25,362 --> 01:11:27,626
in some strange foreign language?

689
01:11:27,698 --> 01:11:29,723
Check for hairpieces, lenses, dentures.

690
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:33,964
I want napkins. I want cigarette butts.
I want the saliva off teacups.

691
01:11:35,205 --> 01:11:38,368
That's a familiar face.
Check him out, will you?

692
01:11:42,813 --> 01:11:44,906
I thought you wanted to dance.

693
01:11:44,982 --> 01:11:47,974
- Excuse me. Where are you going?
- Yeah. I know. Just a minute.

694
01:12:00,564 --> 01:12:03,055
- Are you insane?
- Come on !

695
01:12:21,685 --> 01:12:23,516
Where did they go?

696
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,294
Come here. Come on.

697
01:12:43,107 --> 01:12:46,543
- Don't you understand? I can't do that.
- You just did.

698
01:12:47,444 --> 01:12:50,845
Don't touch your face!
Don't swallow! Don't spit!

699
01:12:50,914 --> 01:12:52,848
Let's clean his teeth.

700
01:13:11,168 --> 01:13:12,931
Who's Vincent?

701
01:13:24,648 --> 01:13:26,582
Don't say anything.

702
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:24,989
What happened?

703
01:16:28,532 --> 01:16:30,466
The scars on your legs?

704
01:16:35,072 --> 01:16:38,337
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron?

705
01:16:38,408 --> 01:16:42,071
This is the exact height
of the front fender.

706
01:16:42,145 --> 01:16:44,773
I looked left instead of right.

707
01:16:48,385 --> 01:16:51,377
Did you just make that up,
or do you use it all the time?

708
01:16:51,455 --> 01:16:53,685
I use it all the time.

709
01:16:55,592 --> 01:16:58,686
I know you had something to do
with the director's death.

710
01:16:58,762 --> 01:17:00,627
That's not true, Irene.

711
01:17:09,306 --> 01:17:12,241
Isn't that the man from last night?

712
01:17:14,711 --> 01:17:16,906
He's nobody.

713
01:17:26,556 --> 01:17:29,218
He's one of our best.

714
01:17:29,293 --> 01:17:32,387
I'm certain he has nothing
to do with this business.

715
01:17:46,343 --> 01:17:49,676
You don't look well. Jerome.

716
01:17:49,746 --> 01:17:51,941
Why don't you go home?

717
01:18:02,693 --> 01:18:05,560
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Jerome Morrow.

718
01:18:05,629 --> 01:18:09,258
I'm sorry. He's ill with nausea.
It's quite common before a mission.

719
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:11,267
Really?

720
01:18:11,335 --> 01:18:15,271
I ought to pay him a visit.
I understand you can show me the way.

721
01:18:59,950 --> 01:19:01,918
You don't know who he is, do you?

722
01:19:21,238 --> 01:19:22,671
Hello?

723
01:19:22,739 --> 01:19:25,367
Eugene, I need you
to be yourself for the day.

724
01:19:25,442 --> 01:19:27,933
I was never very good at it,
remember?

725
01:19:28,011 --> 01:19:30,912
The investigators are coming by.
I'm supposed to be sick.

726
01:19:30,981 --> 01:19:34,246
So you keep telling me.
How long have I got?

727
01:19:34,317 --> 01:19:35,750
Not long.

728
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,523
I guess he's not home.

729
01:21:28,965 --> 01:21:31,365
- Hello?
- I'm here to see Jerome Morrow.

730
01:21:31,434 --> 01:21:33,402
Yes. that's me.
Come up.

731
01:21:35,272 --> 01:21:37,206
I guess he's home.

732
01:22:12,242 --> 01:22:14,073
Come in !

733
01:22:20,083 --> 01:22:21,550
Hello, sweetheart.

734
01:22:24,754 --> 01:22:26,051
Where's my kiss?

735
01:22:30,393 --> 01:22:33,362
Good to see you're feeling better.

736
01:22:34,297 --> 01:22:36,925
Of course. Now that you're here.

737
01:22:45,508 --> 01:22:47,442
Who's your friend?

738
01:22:49,079 --> 01:22:51,013
How can I help?

739
01:22:51,081 --> 01:22:53,311
It's about the director.

740
01:22:53,383 --> 01:22:55,248
Oh. Again?

741
01:22:55,318 --> 01:22:58,310
- I hope it's no trouble.
- No. No trouble.

742
01:22:59,489 --> 01:23:02,049
Forgive me for not giving you
a guided tour.

743
01:23:02,125 --> 01:23:05,424
- Couldn't we do this another time?
- This won't take a moment.

744
01:23:05,495 --> 01:23:08,396
Maybe he can tell me what I've got.

745
01:23:45,502 --> 01:23:47,129
Who were you expecting?

746
01:24:30,113 --> 01:24:32,047
- Yes?
- We have our man, sir.

747
01:24:32,115 --> 01:24:33,639
- You have him?
- We have him in custody.

748
01:24:33,717 --> 01:24:35,651
I'll come right away.

749
01:24:59,909 --> 01:25:01,604
How are you, Jerome?

750
01:25:01,678 --> 01:25:03,612
Not bad. Jerome.

751
01:25:06,883 --> 01:25:10,114
- How the hell did you get up here?
- Oh, I could always walk.

752
01:25:10,186 --> 01:25:12,347
I've been faking it.

753
01:25:31,674 --> 01:25:33,733
- Don't touch me!
- Listen to me.

754
01:25:33,810 --> 01:25:35,744
I don't even know who you are.

755
01:25:35,812 --> 01:25:38,474
I'm the same person I was yesterday.

756
01:25:38,548 --> 01:25:41,483
I can't hear any more
of your lies, Jerome.

757
01:25:41,551 --> 01:25:44,816
My name is Vincent!
I am Vincent Anton Freeman.

758
01:25:44,888 --> 01:25:48,415
I'm a faith birth, de-gene-erate,
whatever you want to call it.

759
01:25:48,491 --> 01:25:51,426
But I am not a murderer.

760
01:25:52,529 --> 01:25:54,087
You're a God child?

761
01:25:56,099 --> 01:25:58,727
But we do have one thing in common.

762
01:25:58,802 --> 01:26:03,330
Only I don't have 20 or 30 years left.
Mine is already 1 0,000 beats overdue.

763
01:26:04,507 --> 01:26:07,567
- It's not possible.
- You are the authority...

764
01:26:07,644 --> 01:26:11,102
on what is not possible,
aren't you, Irene?

765
01:26:13,817 --> 01:26:16,877
They have got you looking
so hard for any flaw...

766
01:26:16,953 --> 01:26:19,353
that after a while
that's all that you see.

767
01:26:22,325 --> 01:26:24,589
For whatever it's worth...

768
01:26:24,661 --> 01:26:27,687
I'm here to tell you
that it is possible.

769
01:26:28,832 --> 01:26:30,766
It is possible.

770
01:27:09,873 --> 01:27:12,774
Congratulations, sir.
We did it.

771
01:27:13,843 --> 01:27:16,641
His spit was found
in the dead director's eye.

772
01:27:16,713 --> 01:27:20,740
While I was busy obsessing
about an eyelash, your instincts...

773
01:27:20,817 --> 01:27:23,342
took us in the right direction.

774
01:27:23,419 --> 01:27:26,752
So the In-Valid had nothing
to do with this?

775
01:27:26,823 --> 01:27:29,883
Our friend here acted alone.
This mission meant everything to him.

776
01:27:29,959 --> 01:27:32,018
Didn't it?

777
01:27:35,665 --> 01:27:39,431
If they miss this launch window,
he won't live to see the next one.

778
01:27:39,502 --> 01:27:44,030
And since nothing can stop the launch
now, he's being very cooperative.

779
01:27:48,244 --> 01:27:49,677
So I imagine...

780
01:27:49,746 --> 01:27:52,579
you'll be celebrating tonight, sir.

781
01:27:52,649 --> 01:27:54,082
Of course.

782
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:12,133
I think she likes us.

783
01:28:13,970 --> 01:28:17,201
Yeah, sure. Just give her a little time.
She'll get used to the idea.

784
01:28:18,274 --> 01:28:21,209
- What was he like?
- Who? The cop?

785
01:28:21,277 --> 01:28:23,711
- He was just a cop.
- Did you catch his name?

786
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:25,372
My name was the topic.

787
01:28:25,448 --> 01:28:27,473
Yeah, well, he'll be back.

788
01:28:27,550 --> 01:28:29,484
They have their man.
It's over.

789
01:28:29,552 --> 01:28:33,113
No, it's not over.
I have to meet him.

790
01:29:11,494 --> 01:29:13,428
My God, you have changed.

791
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:20,128
Don't you recognize your own brother?

792
01:29:21,037 --> 01:29:22,470
Are we brothers?

793
01:29:22,538 --> 01:29:26,065
Our parents both died
thinking they'd outlived you.

794
01:29:27,176 --> 01:29:28,609
I had my doubts.

795
01:29:28,678 --> 01:29:30,942
What are you doing here, Anton?

796
01:29:31,014 --> 01:29:33,346
I should ask you that question.

797
01:29:33,416 --> 01:29:36,544
I have a right to be here.
You don't.

798
01:29:38,654 --> 01:29:41,919
You almost sound
as if you believe that.

799
01:29:41,991 --> 01:29:46,826
I committed no murder.
You must be disappointed.

800
01:29:47,697 --> 01:29:49,289
You committed fraud.

801
01:29:51,768 --> 01:29:54,134
You're in trouble.
I can get you out of here.

802
01:29:54,203 --> 01:29:56,865
Do you have any idea
what it took to get in here?

803
01:29:56,939 --> 01:29:59,635
You've gone as far as you can go.
Come with me now!

804
01:30:00,843 --> 01:30:03,073
There is still a few million
miles left to go.

805
01:30:03,146 --> 01:30:04,636
It's over!

806
01:30:04,714 --> 01:30:07,808
Is that the only way you can succeed
is to see me fail?

807
01:30:07,884 --> 01:30:12,116
God! Even you are gonna tell me
what I can and can't do now!

808
01:30:13,723 --> 01:30:17,682
In case you haven't noticed,
I don't need any rescuing.

809
01:30:18,728 --> 01:30:20,320
But you did once.

810
01:30:22,398 --> 01:30:26,664
Well, you've got all the answers.
How do you explain that?

811
01:30:26,736 --> 01:30:29,068
You didn't beat me that day.
I beat myself.

812
01:30:30,173 --> 01:30:32,107
Who are you trying to convince?

813
01:30:33,242 --> 01:30:35,176
Do you want me
to prove it to you?

814
01:30:36,145 --> 01:30:39,945
It's not important, Anton.
It's forgotten.

815
01:30:41,217 --> 01:30:45,347
Do you want me to prove it to you?
I'll prove it to you !

816
01:30:45,421 --> 01:30:47,082
I do.

817
01:31:58,361 --> 01:31:59,794
Where's the shore?

818
01:31:59,862 --> 01:32:02,023
- You wanna quit?
- We're too far out!

819
01:32:31,761 --> 01:32:34,992
How are you doing this?

820
01:32:35,064 --> 01:32:37,862
How have you done any of this?

821
01:32:37,934 --> 01:32:40,869
- We have to go back.
- It's too late for that.

822
01:32:40,937 --> 01:32:43,098
We're closer to the other side.

823
01:32:43,172 --> 01:32:45,606
What other side?
You wanna drown us both?

824
01:32:47,076 --> 01:32:49,772
You wanna know how I did it?

825
01:32:49,845 --> 01:32:54,475
This is how I did it, Anton. I never
saved anything for the swim back.

826
01:34:39,422 --> 01:34:42,152
You couldn't see, could you?

827
01:34:42,224 --> 01:34:45,057
That night, crossing the street.

828
01:34:46,762 --> 01:34:48,696
You crossed anyway.

829
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:05,112
If you're still interested...

830
01:35:06,949 --> 01:35:08,382
Let me know.

831
01:35:15,024 --> 01:35:16,457
Sorry.

832
01:35:21,364 --> 01:35:23,628
The wind caught it.

833
01:36:17,019 --> 01:36:19,817
You're flying today, aren't you?

834
01:36:19,889 --> 01:36:22,824
Look at what a mess you're in.

835
01:36:25,628 --> 01:36:28,563
Come on.
I have your samples ready.

836
01:36:29,698 --> 01:36:31,791
I don't need any samples
where I'm going.

837
01:36:36,205 --> 01:36:38,503
You might when you get back.

838
01:36:41,677 --> 01:36:44,669
Everything you need
to last you two lifetimes.

839
01:36:47,349 --> 01:36:49,283
Why have you done all this?

840
01:36:50,653 --> 01:36:53,713
So Jerome will always be here
when you need him.

841
01:36:53,789 --> 01:36:57,816
- Where are you going?
- I'm traveling too.

842
01:37:01,564 --> 01:37:04,158
I don't know how to thank you.

843
01:37:07,670 --> 01:37:10,104
I got the better end of the deal.

844
01:37:10,172 --> 01:37:12,402
I only lent you my body.

845
01:37:13,809 --> 01:37:15,936
You lent me your dream.

846
01:37:25,988 --> 01:37:28,354
Not until you're upstairs.

847
01:38:01,190 --> 01:38:02,623
What is this?

848
01:38:02,691 --> 01:38:04,283
New policy.

849
01:38:11,066 --> 01:38:13,159
Flight got you nervous?

850
01:38:14,803 --> 01:38:17,499
Well, there's a problem, Lamar.

851
01:38:17,573 --> 01:38:21,475
I never told you about my son, did l?
He's a big fan of yours.

852
01:38:26,081 --> 01:38:27,946
Just remember...

853
01:38:28,017 --> 01:38:31,680
that I was as good as any
and better than most.

854
01:38:31,754 --> 01:38:33,847
He wants to apply here.

855
01:38:33,923 --> 01:38:37,984
I could've gone up and back,
and nobody would've been the wiser.

856
01:38:38,827 --> 01:38:42,263
Unfortunately, my son's
not all that they promised.

857
01:38:44,133 --> 01:38:46,533
But then, who knows
what he could do?

858
01:38:48,137 --> 01:38:49,798
Right?

859
01:39:06,589 --> 01:39:09,183
For future reference...

860
01:39:09,258 --> 01:39:12,523
right-handed men
don 't hold it with their left.

861
01:39:12,595 --> 01:39:14,961
Just one of those things.

862
01:39:28,043 --> 01:39:30,375
You're gonna miss your flight, Vincent.

863
01:42:16,779 --> 01:42:19,339
For someone who was never
meant for this world...

864
01:42:19,414 --> 01:42:23,248
I must confess I'm suddenly
having a hard time leaving it.

865
01:42:26,155 --> 01:42:30,216
Of course, they say every atom
in our bodies was once part of a star.

866
01:42:31,727 --> 01:42:34,127
Maybe I'm not leaving.

867
01:42:34,196 --> 01:42:36,130
Maybe I'm going home.
