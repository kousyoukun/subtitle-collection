1
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:23,752
You keep your work station
so clean, Jerome.

2
00:05:24,723 --> 00:05:26,816
It's next to godliness.

3
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:29,383
- Isn't that what they say?
- "Godliness."

4
00:05:30,262 --> 00:05:35,222
I reviewed your flight plan.
Not one error in a million keystrokes.

5
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:38,737
Phenomenal. It's right that
someone like you...

6
00:05:38,804 --> 00:05:40,567
is taking us to Titan.

7
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,665
Has the committee
approved the mission?

8
00:05:43,742 --> 00:05:45,505
There's been talk of delay.

9
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,978
You shouldn't listen to talk.

10
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,538
You leave in a week.

11
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:53,312
You've got a substance test.

12
00:06:23,582 --> 00:06:26,710
If you have been notified
for substance anaiysis...

13
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:28,912
piease report
to the testing center.

14
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,198
Never shy.
Pisses on command.

15
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:44,697
I ever tell you that's
a beautiful piece of equipment?

16
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,397
Every time I'm here.

17
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:49,299
Occupational hazard.

18
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,037
I see many in the course of any day.

19
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,409
Yours happens to be
an exceptional example.

20
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:59,082
I don't know why my folks
didn't order one like that for me.

21
00:07:12,798 --> 00:07:15,926
By the way...

22
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:18,469
have I told you about my son?

23
00:07:18,537 --> 00:07:21,631
- No, you haven't.
- Remind me to sometime.

24
00:07:23,842 --> 00:07:26,470
So you're about to go up.

25
00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:28,945
One week left.

26
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:30,948
Please tell me you're excited.

27
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,679
I'll tell you
at the end of the week.

28
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,002
Congratulations, Jerome.

29
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,101
Thank you.

30
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,443
How many launches are there
in a day? A dozen?

31
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,650
Sometimes more.

32
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,353
You're the only one
who watches them all.

33
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:17,757
If you're going to pretend
like you don't care, don't look up.

34
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:22,324
The most unremarkabie
of events.

35
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:26,037
Jerome Morrow,
navigator first ciass...

36
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:29,836
is about to embark on a one-year
manned mission to Titan...

37
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:31,933
the 14th moon of Saturn.

38
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:36,013
A highiy prestigious assignment.
Aithough forJerome...

39
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:39,573
seiection was
virtuaiiy guaranteed at birth.

40
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:44,220
He's biessed with aii the gifts
required for such an undertaking.

41
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:46,780
A genetic quotient
second to none.

42
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,251
No, there is truiy
nothing remarkabie...

43
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,422
about the progress
ofJerome Morrow.

44
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:56,696
Except that
I am notJerome Morrow.

45
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,440
I was conceived
in the Riviera.

46
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:11,950
Not the French Riviera,
the Detroit variety.

47
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,978
They used to say that
a chiid conceived in iove...

48
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,183
has a greater chance of happiness.

49
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:22,260
They don't say that anymore.

50
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,056
I'ii never understand what possessed
my mother to put her faith...

51
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:31,193
in God's hands rather than
those of her iocai geneticist.

52
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,809
Ten fingers, ten toes.
That's aii that used to matter.

53
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:41,471
Not now.
Now, oniy seconds oid...

54
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:45,574
the exact time and cause
of my death was aiready know.

55
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:53,685
Neurological condition:
60% probability.

56
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,353
Manic depression:
42% probability.

57
00:09:56,428 --> 00:10:00,330
Attention deficit disorder:
89% probability.

58
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,366
Heart disorder...

59
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:05,626
99% probability.

60
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:07,638
Early fatal potential.

61
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:10,834
Life expectancy: 30.2 years.

62
00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:14,378
Thirty years.

63
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:16,277
The name?

64
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:18,976
- Anton.
- No!

65
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,985
Vincent Anton.

66
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:26,089
Yeah. That's a good name.

67
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:31,128
I know he'll do something.

68
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,330
From an eariy age I came to think
of myseif as others thought of me.

69
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:45,342
Chronicaiiy iii.
Every skinned knee and runny nose...

70
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,742
was treated iike
it was iife-threatening.

71
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,338
I'm sorry.
The insurance won't cover it.

72
00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:52,542
- If he fell...
- I was told everything...

73
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:55,178
I wish there was
something I could do.

74
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:06,564
Like most parents of their day...

75
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:09,624
they were determined that
their next chiid wouid be born...

76
00:11:09,701 --> 00:11:12,534
in what has become
the naturai way.

77
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:17,735
Your extracted eggs, Marie...

78
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:22,940
have been fertilized
with Antonio's sperm.

79
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,610
After screening, we are
left with two healthy boys...

80
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,846
and two very healthy girls.

81
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:33,221
Naturally, no critical predispositions
to any major inheritable diseases.

82
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,420
All that remains is to select
the most compatible candidate.

83
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:41,187
First, we let's decide on gender.
Have you given it any thought?

84
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:44,463
We would want Vincent
to have a brother, you know...

85
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:46,527
to play with.

86
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:47,765
Of course.
Hello, Vincent.

87
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:55,113
You have specified hazel eyes,
dark hair and fair skin.

88
00:11:56,848 --> 00:12:00,215
I've taken the liberty of eradicating
any potentially prejudicial conditions.

89
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:02,446
Premature baldness, myopia...

90
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,887
alcoholism and
addictive susceptibility...

91
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,925
propensity for violence,
obesity, etc.

92
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:10,723
We didn't want...
Diseases, yes, but...

93
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:15,563
We were just wondering if it's good
to leave a few things to chance?

94
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:19,001
You want to give your child
the best possible start.

95
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,596
Believe me, we have enough
imperfection built in already.

96
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:25,473
Your child doesn't need
any additional burdens.

97
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,808
Keep in mind
this child is still you.

98
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,143
Simply the best of you.

99
00:12:30,882 --> 00:12:34,716
You could conceive naturally a thousand
times and never get such a result.

100
00:12:37,522 --> 00:12:40,685
That's how my brother, Anton,
came into the worid.

101
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,853
A son my father considered
worthy of his name.

102
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,342
What did I tell you?
See how he's grown?

103
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,991
By the time we were
piaying at biood brothers...

104
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:22,227
I understood that there was something
different flowing through my veins...

105
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,701
and I'd need
more than a drop...

106
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,704
if I was going to get anywhere.

107
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,726
Our favorite game was chicken.

108
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:54,163
When our parents weren't watching,
we'd swim out as far as we dared.

109
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:57,861
It was about who wouid get scared
and turn back first.

110
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,786
Come on, you coward!

111
00:14:16,955 --> 00:14:19,947
Of course,
it was aiways me.

112
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,550
Anton was by far
the stronger swimmer...

113
00:14:22,627 --> 00:14:24,788
and he had no excuse
to faii.

114
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,103
Maybe it was the iove of the pianets...

115
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:39,143
or my growing disiike for this one.

116
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:43,238
But for as iong as I can remember,
I have dreamed of going into space.

117
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:47,718
700 million. 750 million.
800 million.

118
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,447
850 million.

119
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,287
How many astronauts are there?

120
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:56,657
I bet I could be one
if I wanted.

121
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:59,196
Don't eat that.
It's Pluto.

122
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:06,932
My goais didn't change a iot
in the intervening years...

123
00:15:07,005 --> 00:15:09,565
much to my parents'dismay.

124
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:21,780
You have to be realistic.
With your heart condition...

125
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:25,812
Mom, there's a chance there's
nothing wrong with my heart.

126
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,051
One in a hundred.

127
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,756
- I'll take it.
- The trouble is, they won't.

128
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,696
Listen. For God's sake...

129
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:36,700
you gotta understand something.

130
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,867
The only way you'll see the inside
of a spaceship is to clean it.

131
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:49,777
My father was right.

132
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:52,544
It didn't matter how much
I iied on my resume.

133
00:15:52,617 --> 00:15:55,552
My reai resume
was in my ceiis.

134
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,919
Why shouid anybody invest
aii that money to train me...

135
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:03,450
when there are a thousand other
appiicants with a far cieaner profile?

136
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:06,088
Of course, it's iiiegai
to discriminate.

137
00:16:06,164 --> 00:16:08,359
"Genoism,"it's caiied.

138
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:11,231
But no one
takes the iaw seriousiy.

139
00:16:18,343 --> 00:16:20,311
If you refuse to disciose...

140
00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:24,678
they can aiways take a sampie
from a door handie or a handshake...

141
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:27,741
even the saiiva
on your appiication form.

142
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:32,884
If in doubt, a iegai drug test
can just as easiiy become...

143
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,189
an iiiegai peek
at your future in the company.

144
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:48,302
You sure you wanna do this?
You know you're gonna lose.

145
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,516
It was the iast time
we swam together...

146
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:03,611
and out into the open sea...

147
00:17:03,688 --> 00:17:06,657
iike aiways, knowing each stroke
to the horizon...

148
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,660
was one we'd have to
make back to the shore.

149
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:26,173
But something was very different
about that day.

150
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:28,303
Every time Anton
tried to puii away...

151
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,644
he found me right beside him.

152
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:37,312
Untii finaiiy,
the impossibie happened.

153
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,436
It was the one moment
in our iives that my brother...

154
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,776
was not as strong as he beiieved
and I was not as weak.

155
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:05,839
It was the moment that made
everything eise possibie.

156
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,986
Like many in my situation...

157
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:55,464
I moved around in the next few years,
getting work where I couid.

158
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,429
I must've cieaned
haif the toiiets in the state.

159
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:02,864
I beionged to a new underciass...

160
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:06,502
no ionger determined
by sociai status or skin coior.

161
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:10,146
- Welcome to Gattaca, gentlemen.
- No.

162
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:13,412
We now have discrimination
down to a science.

163
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,715
There's your cleaning material.

164
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:18,255
Start from the front,
clean all the way back.

165
00:19:19,457 --> 00:19:23,393
And I wanna see my smiling face
on that floor.

166
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:35,263
What about you, Your Majesty?
You dreaming of space?

167
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,742
Come here.

168
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,782
You can start by
cleaning this space right here.

169
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:52,646
I was never more certain of
how far away I was from my goai...

170
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,954
than when I was
standing right beside it.

171
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:09,733
When you clean the glass,
don't clean it too well.

172
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,598
What do you mean?

173
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:14,137
You might get ideas.

174
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:18,198
But if it's clean, it'll be easier to
see me when I'm on the other side of it.

175
00:22:10,695 --> 00:22:13,687
For aii my brave taik,
I knew it was just that.

176
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:16,666
No matter how much I trained
or how much I studied...

177
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:21,068
the best test score wouidn't matter
without the biood test to go with it.

178
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,709
I made up my mind to resort
to more extreme measures.

179
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:29,008
The man who
showed up at my doorstep...

180
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,844
didn't exactiy advertise
in the Yeiiow Pages.

181
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,850
Stand straight.

182
00:22:35,553 --> 00:22:38,113
- How did you hear about me?
- People.

183
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:43,426
Any distinguishing marks?
Tattoos, scars, birthmarks?

184
00:22:43,494 --> 00:22:46,429
No. I don't think so.

185
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:51,527
You're serious about this?
I hope you're not wasting my time.

186
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:54,037
No, I'd give 100%.

187
00:22:55,206 --> 00:22:58,266
That'll get you halfway there.

188
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:02,541
That's an old edition,
but I know it all by heart.

189
00:23:03,414 --> 00:23:05,348
By heart?

190
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:09,820
You realize the commitment
is binding.

191
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,556
You have somebody?

192
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:38,175
For the geneticaiiy superior,
success is easier to attain...

193
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:40,217
but is by no means guaranteed.

194
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:44,483
After aii, there is no gene for fate.

195
00:23:44,555 --> 00:23:46,853
And when,
for one reason or another...

196
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,917
a member of the eiite
faiis on hard times...

197
00:23:49,994 --> 00:23:54,658
their genetic identity becomes a
vaiued commodity for the unscrupuious.

198
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:57,394
One man's ioss is another man's gain.

199
00:23:57,468 --> 00:23:59,436
His credentials are impeccable.

200
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,529
An expiration date
you wouldn't believe.

201
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:09,440
The guy's practically
gonna live forever.

202
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:12,312
He's got an I. Q off the register.

203
00:24:12,383 --> 00:24:15,113
Better than 20/20 in both eyes.

204
00:24:15,186 --> 00:24:18,246
And the heart of an ox.
He could run through a wall.

205
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,562
If he could still run.

206
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:31,492
Actually, he was
a big-time swimming star.

207
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:37,167
You could go anywhere with this guy's
helix tucked under your arm.

208
00:24:41,245 --> 00:24:45,409
What did I tell you? You look so right
together I wanna double my fee.

209
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,974
- We don't look anything alike.
- It's close enough.

210
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:50,350
When was the last time anybody
looked at a photograph?

211
00:24:50,421 --> 00:24:53,288
You could have my face on your name tag,
for Christ's sake.

212
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:56,589
- How do I explain the accident?
- That's the beautiful thing.

213
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,993
It happened out of the country.

214
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:02,521
There's no record he broke his back.
As far as anyone's concerned...

215
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,127
he's still a walking, talking,
fully-productive member of society.

216
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:09,503
You just have to get him clean
and fill in the last year of his life.

217
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:12,072
You're a foreigner.

218
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:15,044
They don't care
where you were born, just how.

219
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,946
Blood has no nationality.

220
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,507
As long as it's got
what they're looking for...

221
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,644
it's the only passport you need.

222
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,954
Who lives up there?

223
00:25:26,457 --> 00:25:28,391
I certainly don't.

224
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:34,198
So began the process
of becomingJerome.

225
00:25:34,265 --> 00:25:38,827
Myopia is one of the most obvious
signs of a disadvantaged birth.

226
00:25:38,903 --> 00:25:40,871
Isn't there another way?

227
00:25:40,938 --> 00:25:43,839
Surgery's no good.
They'll see the scars.

228
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:46,776
It's contact lenses or a white cane.

229
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:51,910
Besides, the color doesn't match.

230
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:54,975
He's right.
My eyes are prettier.

231
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:01,424
You understand
I take 25% of everything you make.

232
00:26:01,492 --> 00:26:06,794
If it doesn't work out, this equipment
must be returned within seven days.

233
00:26:06,864 --> 00:26:09,128
And you don't get your deposit back.

234
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,328
- I thought you said 20%.
- He told me 20%.

235
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:14,394
- Twenty percent.
- It's not negotiable.

236
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:30,977
I guess that's it.

237
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,018
Not quite.

238
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,924
- Why? What?
- There's still the matter of height.

239
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:39,228
- How tall are you?
- 4'6".

240
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,288
How tall were you
before the accident?

241
00:26:41,365 --> 00:26:44,562
Unfortunately,
his profile says he's 6'1 ".

242
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:47,426
I'll wear lifts.

243
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,531
Even with lifts,
you're not that tall.

244
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:56,112
So, what?

245
00:27:07,391 --> 00:27:09,450
We never discussed that.

246
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,495
I thought you were serious.

247
00:27:11,562 --> 00:27:13,928
I am. I'm not doing that.

248
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,060
I won't.

249
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:30,378
Jerome never
questioned my commitment again.

250
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:33,440
I took my mind off the pain
by reminding myseif...

251
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:39,354
that when I eventuaiiy did stand up
I'd be two inches cioser to the stars.

252
00:27:39,423 --> 00:27:41,857
You all right?

253
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:43,860
Yeah.

254
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,290
Wanna go dancing?

255
00:27:49,867 --> 00:27:52,529
You had to be a right-hander.

256
00:27:52,603 --> 00:27:55,333
I guess no one orders
southpaws anymore.

257
00:27:56,874 --> 00:27:57,806
Jerome Morrow.

258
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:02,045
It's a nice name.

259
00:28:04,248 --> 00:28:07,684
- It's my name.
- I can't be you without it.

260
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:10,152
What makes you think
you can be me at all?

261
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:21,731
Look at this.

262
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,068
Look at it.

263
00:28:25,836 --> 00:28:27,770
It's nice.

264
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,807
I'm impressed. Is it real?

265
00:28:31,642 --> 00:28:34,270
Are you colorblind too?

266
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:36,040
- It's silver.
- So?

267
00:28:36,113 --> 00:28:40,174
Jerome Morrow was never meant
to be one step down on the podium.

268
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:43,753
With all I had going for me...

269
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:46,656
I was still second best.

270
00:28:49,026 --> 00:28:50,960
Me.

271
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:54,623
So how do you expect
to pull this off?

272
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,835
I don't know exactly.

273
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,276
Your signature needs work.

274
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:10,576
It soon came time to put
our preparations to the test.

275
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:14,414
Jerome was engineered with everything
needed to get into Gattaca...

276
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:17,454
except the desire to do so.

277
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:19,455
Do you really wanna be in there?

278
00:29:19,523 --> 00:29:22,924
I don't wanna be in there.
I wanna be up there.

279
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:26,228
What's up there?

280
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:29,566
That's what I wanna find out, Jerome.

281
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:33,903
Call me Eugene.

282
00:29:34,905 --> 00:29:36,839
My middle name.

283
00:29:38,142 --> 00:29:41,111
If you're gonna beJerome,
you better start getting used to it.

284
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,451
Where's my sample?

285
00:29:53,524 --> 00:29:55,583
In the refrigerator!
Door on the left!

286
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:58,894
Which pouch?

287
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,590
Oh, any of them.

288
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,602
Should I test it?

289
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,605
If you like!

290
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,108
- What's wrong with the machine?
- Nothing!

291
00:30:19,183 --> 00:30:21,310
It's a hot sample.
You've been drinking again.

292
00:30:21,385 --> 00:30:24,877
- I haven't!
- Christ, it's 8:00 in the morning!

293
00:30:24,955 --> 00:30:26,479
I haven't!

294
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,559
This is no joke!
My interview is in an hour!

295
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,341
There is more vodka in this piss
than there is piss!

296
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:50,312
I'm sorry.
I had half a glass to celebrate.

297
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:53,214
Try Friday's.
That one will be okay.

298
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:56,742
- There's only Wednesday left.
- That's the one.

299
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,260
Listen. It's not too late
to back out.

300
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:19,608
This is the last day you're gonna be you
and I'm gonna be me.

301
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:25,278
Well?

302
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:55,877
Congratulations.

303
00:31:57,615 --> 00:32:00,516
Well, what about the interview?

304
00:32:00,584 --> 00:32:02,984
That was it.

305
00:32:11,058 --> 00:32:12,218
I got it.

306
00:32:14,161 --> 00:32:16,095
Of course you got it.

307
00:32:26,006 --> 00:32:27,997
And that's the way it was.

308
00:32:28,075 --> 00:32:33,012
Daiiy, I disposed of as much ioose skin,
fingernaiis and hair as possibie...

309
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:38,279
to iimit how much of my In-Vaiid seif
I wouid ieave in the Vaiid worid.

310
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:49,229
Meanwhiie, Eugene prepared sampies of
his own superior body matter...

311
00:32:49,296 --> 00:32:51,264
so that I might pass for him.

312
00:32:51,332 --> 00:32:54,733
Customized urine pouches
for the frequent substance tests...

313
00:32:54,802 --> 00:32:58,738
fingertip biood sachets
for security checks...

314
00:32:58,806 --> 00:33:01,502
viais filied with other traces.

315
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:05,876
Whiie Eugene suppiied me
with a new identity, I paid the rent...

316
00:33:05,946 --> 00:33:09,347
and kept him in the styie
to which he'd become accustomed.

317
00:33:10,651 --> 00:33:14,212
Eugene never suffered from the routine
discrimination of a "utero"...

318
00:33:14,288 --> 00:33:17,314
"faith birth"or "In-Vaiid"
as we were caiied.

319
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:22,727
A "Vaiid, "a "vitro, "a "made man,
he suffered under a different burden.

320
00:33:22,796 --> 00:33:24,423
The burden of perfection.

321
00:33:26,567 --> 00:33:28,831
I was now a member
of a reiativeiy new...

322
00:33:28,902 --> 00:33:32,303
and particuiariy detested
segment of society.

323
00:33:32,373 --> 00:33:36,002
One of those who refuses
to piay the hand that he was deait.

324
00:33:36,076 --> 00:33:41,139
I am most commoniy known
as a "borrowed iadder"or...

325
00:33:41,215 --> 00:33:44,082
a "de-gene-erate."

326
00:33:48,655 --> 00:33:50,953
In the guise ofJerome Morrow...

327
00:33:51,024 --> 00:33:53,754
I have risen quickiy
through the ranks of Gattaca.

328
00:33:53,827 --> 00:33:56,295
Oniy one of the mission directors
has ever come ciose...

329
00:33:56,363 --> 00:33:59,161
to discovering my true identity.

330
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:02,930
Strange to think, he may have more
success exposing me in death...

331
00:34:03,003 --> 00:34:05,836
than he ever did in iife.

332
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,182
We apoiogize for any inconvenience.

333
00:34:27,895 --> 00:34:31,126
- I think we can rule out suicide.
- Excuse me?

334
00:34:31,198 --> 00:34:33,132
Nothing.

335
00:34:34,168 --> 00:34:35,567
Thank you.

336
00:34:38,338 --> 00:34:42,069
This will take a while.
We might have to push things back.

337
00:34:55,689 --> 00:35:00,353
Irene, I want you to
assist the investigators.

338
00:35:00,427 --> 00:35:02,452
My work, Director.
That would put me behind.

339
00:35:02,529 --> 00:35:04,554
I appreciate your sacrifice.

340
00:35:06,767 --> 00:35:09,133
Will you see that
I don't lose my place in line?

341
00:35:09,203 --> 00:35:11,637
Your place is assured.

342
00:35:11,705 --> 00:35:14,196
So, will you kindly inform
the authorities...

343
00:35:14,274 --> 00:35:17,573
that we will cooperate
in any way...

344
00:35:17,644 --> 00:35:21,011
although we can't tolerate
a major disruption.

345
00:35:21,081 --> 00:35:23,140
- Director...
- Thank you.

346
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,910
Thank you.

347
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,110
How will this affect the mission?

348
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:34,307
We're still going ahead
as planned.

349
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,215
The launch window's only open
until week's end...

350
00:35:37,285 --> 00:35:41,187
and tragic though
this event may be...

351
00:35:41,256 --> 00:35:45,386
it hasn't stopped
the planets' turning, has it?

352
00:35:56,271 --> 00:35:58,831
- What happened?
- I'm going up.

353
00:35:59,608 --> 00:36:01,542
When?

354
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,669
End of the week.

355
00:36:05,113 --> 00:36:07,172
That soon?

356
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:10,013
What about the mission director?

357
00:36:11,686 --> 00:36:13,176
He's dead.

358
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,582
Are you serious?

359
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:23,263
He was found in his office today beaten
so badly they had to check his name tag.

360
00:36:25,033 --> 00:36:27,433
You are serious.

361
00:36:27,502 --> 00:36:28,560
So that's it.

362
00:36:28,637 --> 00:36:31,868
There's nothing between us
and ignition.

363
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:36,438
I'm going up.

364
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,570
- The man was murdered.
- So? I didn't do it.

365
00:36:40,649 --> 00:36:43,914
I didn't say you did, but the place
is gonna be crawling with Hoovers.

366
00:36:43,985 --> 00:36:47,614
I'll take my chances with the
"J. Edgars" over the mission director.

367
00:36:47,689 --> 00:36:52,456
Besides, what if they do find something?
I'll be out of their jurisdiction.

368
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:00,392
We have to get drunk immediately.

369
00:37:07,909 --> 00:37:10,537
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- I hope our table's ready.

370
00:37:10,612 --> 00:37:13,638
- I understand you're leaving us.
- Looks that way.

371
00:37:13,715 --> 00:37:16,343
- We're going to miss you.
- You've opened the wine, I hope?

372
00:37:16,418 --> 00:37:19,910
- Of course, sir.
- Pour yourself a glass, Cavendish.

373
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,114
Thank you, sir.

374
00:37:44,779 --> 00:37:45,939
How old?

375
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,948
- Me?
- The specimen.

376
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:50,951
I kissed him five minutes ago.
A real good one.

377
00:37:52,254 --> 00:37:54,654
I'll see what I can do.

378
00:37:58,793 --> 00:38:01,353
- You want the full sequence?
- Yes.

379
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:02,487
Thank you.

380
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,060
Good luck.

381
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:19,142
Some sampies may be consumed
in the sequencing process.

382
00:38:22,918 --> 00:38:25,409
9.3. Quite a catch.

383
00:38:27,088 --> 00:38:30,353
Yes. Quite a catch.

384
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:59,486
How many times have I told Cavendish?

385
00:38:59,554 --> 00:39:02,853
This can't have been opened
more than five minutes ago!

386
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,620
A wine like this needs to breathe.
Remember that.

387
00:39:05,694 --> 00:39:08,288
You know, they say
when you're weightless...

388
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:12,461
it's the closest thing
to being in the womb.

389
00:39:15,904 --> 00:39:18,702
I can't believe
you pulled this off.

390
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,241
They're sending you up there.

391
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:23,800
Up there, for Christ's sake.
You, of all people.

392
00:39:23,878 --> 00:39:26,176
I hate to think of you
alone in that room for a year.

393
00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:28,408
Don't think about it.
Anyway...

394
00:39:28,483 --> 00:39:31,281
the room I'm stuck in
is bigger than your tin can.

395
00:39:31,353 --> 00:39:33,617
You know what I'm saying.
What are you gonna do?

396
00:39:34,856 --> 00:39:37,416
I have my books.
I go places in my head.

397
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,284
- I'd be happier if you had company.
- I have visitors!

398
00:39:41,363 --> 00:39:45,129
- None that you don't pay.
- I wouldn't have it any other way.

399
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,829
Seriously,
what are you gonna do?

400
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:53,031
I'm gonna finish this.

401
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,012
What's Titan like
this time of year?

402
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:13,189
What's Titan like?

403
00:40:13,261 --> 00:40:15,923
Titan is exactly like this.

404
00:40:28,143 --> 00:40:30,077
All the time.

405
00:40:30,145 --> 00:40:34,377
It's got a cloud around it so thick
nobody can tell what's underneath.

406
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:37,184
Maybe there's nothing there.

407
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,480
There's something there.

408
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,994
You should be going
instead of me.

409
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,627
Why?

410
00:40:51,933 --> 00:40:54,197
Because up there
your legs wouldn't matter.

411
00:41:01,276 --> 00:41:03,210
I'm scared of heights.

412
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:25,899
I'm sorry!

413
00:41:26,868 --> 00:41:30,770
Do you want this?
I'll save some for you, shall I?

414
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:43,182
- I'm really sorry.
- You're not that sorry.

415
00:41:48,456 --> 00:41:51,914
Don't give me a hard time.
Give me a break.

416
00:41:54,696 --> 00:41:56,459
Come on!

417
00:41:56,531 --> 00:41:59,022
- I'm sorry.
- Help!

418
00:42:09,344 --> 00:42:10,276
I wasn't drunk.

419
00:42:10,345 --> 00:42:14,247
- What do you mean?
- When I walked in front of that car.

420
00:42:15,016 --> 00:42:16,643
What car?

421
00:42:16,718 --> 00:42:19,016
I stepped right out
in front of it.

422
00:42:20,588 --> 00:42:22,783
I'd never been more sober
in my life.

423
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,591
- Go to sleep.
- Couldn't even get that right.

424
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:34,492
"If at first you don't succeed,
try, try again."

425
00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:36,503
Go to sleep.

426
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,743
I'm proud of you, Vincent.

427
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:50,374
You must be drunk
to call me Vincent.

428
00:43:30,959 --> 00:43:33,223
- How much do you need?
- Twenty minutes.

429
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:57,184
You can go.

430
00:44:03,324 --> 00:44:05,258
It's all right, Irene.
You're excused.

431
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:34,953
We found our man. It's the only
specimen we can't account for.

432
00:44:35,023 --> 00:44:37,082
Every ten years or so,
things go our way.

433
00:44:37,158 --> 00:44:39,649
The eyelash?
What do you know about him?

434
00:44:39,727 --> 00:44:41,854
He's an unregistered In-Valid.

435
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:45,365
He was a janitor here until
a few years back when he disappeared.

436
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,697
So the specimen could have
been here since then.

437
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:51,569
Take a look at the floor.
Nothing lays around here for very long.

438
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:56,269
And motive? Would a janitor come back
to kill a man he never knew?

439
00:44:56,344 --> 00:44:58,812
His profile does suggest
a violent temperament.

440
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,374
If I'm not mistaken, it also
suggests that he's a sick man.

441
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:07,319
There's a 90% chance the owner of this
eyelash has died of natural causes.

442
00:45:07,388 --> 00:45:11,347
Then there's a ten percent chance he's
alive. It's a lost-and-found case, sir.

443
00:45:11,426 --> 00:45:15,021
We find the man who's lost an eyelash,
we have the murderer.

444
00:45:15,096 --> 00:45:17,223
I'll do a cross check,
find out about his family...

445
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:20,893
I've already run it. There's no record
of any living relative.

446
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,401
That's a damn shame, sir.

447
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:26,270
Check the entry log,
alibis, grudges.

448
00:45:26,341 --> 00:45:28,275
I look around,
I see a lot of dry eyes.

449
00:45:28,343 --> 00:45:32,245
The mission director
was not universally loved.

450
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,206
He was leading the cutbacks
in the program.

451
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,184
With all due respect, sir...

452
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:43,648
Whatever you say.

453
00:45:59,974 --> 00:46:02,943
Jerome, Jerome,
the metronome.

454
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,205
I could play the piano
by that heartbeat of his.

455
00:46:07,648 --> 00:46:11,084
Mr. Director, you will be pleased
to know we have a suspect.

456
00:46:11,152 --> 00:46:13,279
That is a relief.
Who is it?

457
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:18,155
We found an unaccounted for specimen
in the south wing. Here's his picture.

458
00:46:20,128 --> 00:46:23,393
- An In-Valid.
- We are still following other leads.

459
00:46:23,464 --> 00:46:27,093
Be that as it may,
I'm having this posted immediately.

460
00:46:27,168 --> 00:46:28,066
I'm curious.

461
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:33,996
An advantage, I should imagine,
in your line of work.

462
00:46:34,075 --> 00:46:36,669
Your hiring practices.

463
00:46:36,744 --> 00:46:39,269
Our recruitment philosophy.

464
00:46:39,347 --> 00:46:41,508
Who do you have to be
to be here?

465
00:46:41,582 --> 00:46:46,144
Naturally, our standard is beyond
that of the common citizen.

466
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,485
Even amongst your people, you must
have varying levels of excellence.

467
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:54,119
Occasionally we've had to accept
candidates with minor shortcomings...

468
00:46:54,195 --> 00:46:57,631
but nothing that would prohibit
someone from working in a field...

469
00:46:57,698 --> 00:47:01,156
such as law enforcement,
for example.

470
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:05,103
But now there are enough
of the right kind of people...

471
00:47:05,173 --> 00:47:07,971
to warrant a new measuring stick.

472
00:47:08,042 --> 00:47:10,067
Bodies with minds to match.

473
00:47:10,144 --> 00:47:15,138
Essential as we push out further
and further.

474
00:47:15,216 --> 00:47:17,309
Yet you still
closely monitor performance.

475
00:47:17,385 --> 00:47:20,616
We have to ensure that people
are meeting their potential.

476
00:47:20,688 --> 00:47:23,452
- And exceeding it.
- No one exceeds his potential.

477
00:47:23,524 --> 00:47:24,650
If he did?

478
00:47:24,725 --> 00:47:28,525
It would simply mean we did not
accurately gauge him in the first place.

479
00:47:42,043 --> 00:47:43,977
- Are you all right?
- Terrific.

480
00:48:09,604 --> 00:48:11,799
This is the entry log
for the last seven days.

481
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,609
What about you?

482
00:48:17,612 --> 00:48:18,943
Do you have an alibi?

483
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:23,408
- I was alone.
- I find that hard to believe.

484
00:48:24,285 --> 00:48:25,582
Excuse me.

485
00:48:34,795 --> 00:48:36,888
I'll take care of that.

486
00:48:51,379 --> 00:48:55,179
I see I'm not the only one who
looks up every time there's a launch.

487
00:48:55,249 --> 00:48:57,217
- Hello.
- Hello.

488
00:49:00,087 --> 00:49:02,487
It's awful about the director.

489
00:49:02,557 --> 00:49:04,616
Awful it didn't happen sooner.

490
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:09,894
Didn't the director threaten to
cancel your mission more than once?

491
00:49:09,964 --> 00:49:12,865
- Yes, he did.
- Somebody did you a favor.

492
00:49:12,934 --> 00:49:15,164
Do they have any idea whose hand
I should be shaking?

493
00:49:15,236 --> 00:49:17,704
They found an eyelash
in the south wing.

494
00:49:17,772 --> 00:49:20,605
- Does it have a name?
- Just some In-Valid.

495
00:49:27,982 --> 00:49:30,974
I had you sequenced.
I read your profile.

496
00:49:32,653 --> 00:49:34,143
I'm sorry.

497
00:49:37,792 --> 00:49:40,192
Seems you're everything
they say you are and more.

498
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:47,125
What about you? You're engineered
just like the rest of us.

499
00:49:47,835 --> 00:49:49,359
Not quite.

500
00:49:50,771 --> 00:49:53,501
"Unacceptable likelihood
of heart failure."

501
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:55,633
I think that's what the manual says.

502
00:49:55,710 --> 00:50:00,511
The only trip I'll take in space is
around the sun on the satellite here.

503
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:05,446
If there's anything wrong with you,
I can't see it from here.

504
00:50:09,957 --> 00:50:11,891
If you don't believe me...

505
00:50:14,829 --> 00:50:18,230
Here. Take it.

506
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,735
If you're still interested,
let me know.

507
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,444
I'm sorry.
The wind caught it.

508
00:51:12,953 --> 00:51:16,616
Is this the approach path
that we discussed?

509
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,287
Absolutely, Director.

510
00:51:22,363 --> 00:51:24,297
Quite right.

511
00:51:39,914 --> 00:51:41,848
Listen to what I'm saying to you.

512
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:44,146
I want what I ordered.

513
00:51:45,219 --> 00:51:47,847
It's a completely different color.

514
00:51:47,922 --> 00:51:50,220
Now, I'm bored of talking to you.

515
00:51:50,291 --> 00:51:52,555
I'm bored.
I'll call you back.

516
00:51:54,795 --> 00:51:57,286
That was the company
that sent us your hair dye.

517
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:00,299
They sent me "summer wheat"
instead of"honey dawn."

518
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,699
Any fool knows
it's two shades lighter.

519
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:04,863
She said,
"Why don't you try a change?"

520
00:52:04,939 --> 00:52:06,873
We can't use a change.

521
00:52:08,242 --> 00:52:11,769
Now I'm probably gonna have to pay
for the five boxes they've sent me.

522
00:52:11,846 --> 00:52:13,279
We can't stay here.

523
00:52:13,347 --> 00:52:15,747
Idiots I have to deal with,
you wouldn't believe.

524
00:52:15,816 --> 00:52:18,216
They think I killed
the mission director.

525
00:52:20,321 --> 00:52:24,621
- What makes them think that?
- They found my eyelash.

526
00:52:26,026 --> 00:52:27,459
Where?

527
00:52:27,528 --> 00:52:29,393
In the corridor.

528
00:52:29,463 --> 00:52:32,660
Well, it could be worse.
They could've found it in your eye.

529
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:35,258
They've got my picture
plastered up all over the place.

530
00:52:36,003 --> 00:52:38,801
I can't turn around
without seeing my own face.

531
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:43,776
- They'll recognize me.
- They won't recognize you.

532
00:52:43,844 --> 00:52:47,280
I don't recognize you!
They won't marry the eyelash to you.

533
00:52:47,348 --> 00:52:49,816
They won't believe
that one of their elite...

534
00:52:49,884 --> 00:52:52,182
could have suckered them
all this time.

535
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:54,517
No, no, no.
We change nothing.

536
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:56,055
We do as we planned.

537
00:52:56,123 --> 00:52:58,648
You'reJerome Morrow,
navigator first class.

538
00:52:58,726 --> 00:53:01,126
I'm notJerome Morrow.

539
00:53:01,195 --> 00:53:03,322
I'm a murder suspect.

540
00:53:03,397 --> 00:53:05,763
What are you doing?

541
00:53:05,833 --> 00:53:07,926
That's more than a day's work!

542
00:53:08,002 --> 00:53:10,630
- Wait.
- We can't stay here.

543
00:53:10,704 --> 00:53:12,638
Stop that!

544
00:53:12,706 --> 00:53:14,833
Oh, fine!

545
00:53:14,909 --> 00:53:19,073
You leave if you want,
but you're not taking that stuff.

546
00:53:19,146 --> 00:53:21,080
That stuff is mine!

547
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:25,852
I could've rented myself out
to somebody with a spine...

548
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,947
if I'd known you were going to go
belly-up on me at the last gasp.

549
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:33,256
You can't quit on me now.

550
00:53:33,327 --> 00:53:37,127
I've put too much into this.
What do you want me to do?

551
00:53:37,198 --> 00:53:40,133
Wheel in there
and finish the job myself?

552
00:53:42,069 --> 00:53:44,299
They're going to find me.

553
00:53:46,507 --> 00:53:48,441
You still don't understand, do you?

554
00:53:51,545 --> 00:53:54,105
When they look at you,
they don't see you anymore.

555
00:53:54,181 --> 00:53:55,773
They only see me.

556
00:54:10,631 --> 00:54:13,566
Keep your lashes on your lids
where they belong.

557
00:54:15,536 --> 00:54:17,970
How could you be so careless?

558
00:54:50,738 --> 00:54:52,569
I'm going out.

559
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,665
Where are you going?

560
00:54:54,742 --> 00:54:58,007
If I'm gonna get arrested tomorrow,
I'm gonna go out tonight.

561
00:54:58,078 --> 00:55:01,206
- You sure that's a good idea?
- Well, it was your idea...

562
00:55:01,282 --> 00:55:03,443
not to change anything.

563
00:55:03,517 --> 00:55:06,486
- Who's going?
- Just everybody.

564
00:55:07,855 --> 00:55:09,379
Everybody.

565
00:55:09,456 --> 00:55:11,890
If I don't go,
it'll look suspicious.

566
00:55:13,794 --> 00:55:16,126
You don't want
to look suspicious, do you?

567
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:22,528
Thanks.

568
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,097
Who ordered this?

569
00:56:24,164 --> 00:56:26,428
What are we doing here?

570
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,333
I'm following a lead.
Forgive me, but that's what I do.

571
00:56:29,403 --> 00:56:31,598
I'm a detective.
I follow leads.

572
00:56:31,672 --> 00:56:34,835
What makes you think
the owner of the eyelash is here?

573
00:56:34,908 --> 00:56:38,935
He's an In-Valid, sir. Where do we look
for In-Valids but where In-Valids are?

574
00:56:39,013 --> 00:56:40,776
He's an In-Valid?

575
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:45,979
He's an In-Valid clever enough
to go unregistered all these years.

576
00:56:46,053 --> 00:56:48,681
Do you think he's likely
to lie down for us now?

577
00:56:48,756 --> 00:56:51,486
- Well, what would you suggest?
- Move the inquiry...

578
00:56:51,558 --> 00:56:52,991
back to the scene.

579
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:56,154
Draw a five-mile radius around Gattaca,
sweep again, random stops.

580
00:57:18,819 --> 00:57:21,788
You're a navigator?
At Gattaca?

581
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:24,016
That's what it says, doesn't it?

582
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,693
It doesn't say you're crippled.

583
00:57:28,462 --> 00:57:30,259
I'm not crippled.

584
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:33,231
I hurt my leg training, you moron.

585
00:57:34,301 --> 00:57:36,235
How dare you question me?

586
00:57:36,303 --> 00:57:37,668
Yeah, right.

587
00:57:37,738 --> 00:57:40,866
- What's your number?
- All right, forget it.

588
00:57:40,941 --> 00:57:43,535
What's your number,
you fucking flatfoot?

589
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:46,238
I said forget it.
What do you want, an apology?

590
00:57:46,313 --> 00:57:47,871
It gets to you, doesn't it?

591
00:57:47,948 --> 00:57:50,917
It gets to you that I can do
what you can only dream of!

592
00:57:50,984 --> 00:57:55,148
I'm getting off this ball of dirt!
How dare you question me?

593
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:57,986
- That's harassment.
- My mistake.

594
00:57:58,058 --> 00:57:59,992
What's your number?

595
00:58:02,529 --> 00:58:05,430
May I remind you
that this is a crime scene?

596
00:58:05,499 --> 00:58:07,558
What's this man doing here?

597
00:58:07,634 --> 00:58:11,570
- What are you doing, old man?
- Doing my job, sir.

598
00:58:12,873 --> 00:58:16,309
- This is evidence.
- But it's just trash.

599
00:59:09,163 --> 00:59:11,131
You didn't know?

600
00:59:11,198 --> 00:59:14,258
- Oh, yes.
- Wonderful, wasn't it?

601
00:59:16,103 --> 00:59:18,901
Twelve fingers or one,
it's how you play.

602
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,075
That piece can only
be played with 12.

603
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,761
What's all this about?

604
00:59:44,598 --> 00:59:46,532
It's probably nothing.

605
01:00:24,338 --> 01:00:27,739
You better not. I don't want to give you
a contaminated specimen.

606
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,809
Get my meaning?

607
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,701
Thanks.

608
01:01:01,775 --> 01:01:04,710
You never know
where those swabs have been.

609
01:01:06,613 --> 01:01:09,207
I want to show you something.

610
01:01:55,262 --> 01:01:57,321
Come on!
We'll miss it!

611
01:02:25,258 --> 01:02:27,488
Come on.
We'll miss it.

612
01:03:14,841 --> 01:03:16,775
What did I tell you?

613
01:03:37,764 --> 01:03:39,789
- Strange.
- What?

614
01:03:39,866 --> 01:03:43,802
- Your eyes look different.
- I guess it must be the light.

615
01:03:45,338 --> 01:03:46,771
Must be.

616
01:04:08,962 --> 01:04:11,123
Positive match.

617
01:04:11,198 --> 01:04:12,790
I'm impressed.

618
01:04:14,067 --> 01:04:16,558
The cup was definitely used
since the original sweep?

619
01:04:17,537 --> 01:04:19,471
Two samples. Two days.

620
01:04:19,539 --> 01:04:24,135
Either the suspect returned to the scene
of the crime to get a drink of water...

621
01:04:24,211 --> 01:04:25,906
or he still works there.

622
01:04:25,979 --> 01:04:28,743
I thought we checked
all the service staff.

623
01:04:28,815 --> 01:04:31,079
I don't think he cleans up
the place anymore.

624
01:04:31,151 --> 01:04:34,416
I have a feeling he might be there
under false pretenses.

625
01:04:34,488 --> 01:04:37,946
A borrowed ladder?
At Gattaca?

626
01:04:38,024 --> 01:04:41,187
It's far-fetched,
but it's not impossible.

627
01:04:41,261 --> 01:04:44,424
I find it hard to believe
he could be one of their elite workers.

628
01:04:44,498 --> 01:04:47,865
He wouldn't have the mental faculty
or the physical stamina.

629
01:04:47,934 --> 01:04:49,868
Maybe you're underestimating him.

630
01:04:49,936 --> 01:04:53,099
Maybe he is an impostor,
and maybe the director found out.

631
01:04:53,173 --> 01:04:57,837
That could be his motive. Let's sample
every internal employee intravenously.

632
01:04:57,911 --> 01:05:00,846
Two-thirds of their work force
fall under that category.

633
01:05:00,914 --> 01:05:04,873
We'd close them down for days. A
fingertip or urine sample is sufficient.

634
01:05:04,951 --> 01:05:09,888
I suggest blood from the vein.
I hope I'm not out of line.

635
01:05:38,018 --> 01:05:41,749
It's only a matter of time, sir.

636
01:05:45,258 --> 01:05:47,556
What's with the plungers, Lamar?

637
01:05:50,297 --> 01:05:52,231
You open up a blood bank?

638
01:05:52,299 --> 01:05:56,065
The gentlemen of law enforcement
are concerned...

639
01:05:56,136 --> 01:05:59,970
that my testing methods
may have been compromised.

640
01:06:12,352 --> 01:06:14,718
- Goddamn!
- I'm sorry.

641
01:06:14,788 --> 01:06:17,416
- Are you out of practice?
- Here, let me look at that.

642
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:18,923
It's all right.

643
01:06:20,377 --> 01:06:23,107
Luckily, it looks as though
we have enough.

644
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:26,741
If you need more, you can always
get it off his shoes.

645
01:06:47,938 --> 01:06:49,872
So you didn't do it, after all.

646
01:06:52,243 --> 01:06:54,177
I guess somebody beat me to it.

647
01:06:54,245 --> 01:06:55,837
I guess.

648
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:04,347
I leave in two days.

649
01:07:07,558 --> 01:07:09,788
I guess you know that.

650
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:11,293
But...

651
01:07:24,174 --> 01:07:26,039
That's the last.

652
01:07:27,177 --> 01:07:30,476
- Something's not right.
- He's not here.

653
01:07:30,548 --> 01:07:34,040
No, we missed something.
I say we test again.

654
01:07:34,118 --> 01:07:36,484
Test? I cannot allow you...

655
01:07:36,554 --> 01:07:38,317
to disrupt operations any further.

656
01:07:38,389 --> 01:07:41,256
You're not concerned about having
a murderer in your midst?

657
01:07:41,325 --> 01:07:44,783
Right now your presence
is creating more of a threat.

658
01:07:44,862 --> 01:07:47,831
The window for our latest launch
is open for seven days...

659
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:49,832
once every 70 years...

660
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:52,164
so it's rather crucial
we leave on time.

661
01:07:53,304 --> 01:07:56,034
The mission means a great deal
to you, doesn't it?

662
01:07:56,106 --> 01:07:59,633
And your late colleague
opposed it, didn't he?

663
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:02,679
Take another look
at my profile, Detective.

664
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:05,715
You won't find a violent bone
in my body.

665
01:08:05,783 --> 01:08:09,275
My apologies, Director.
We won't trouble you any further.

666
01:08:11,055 --> 01:08:13,990
This is not the only place
we can look.

667
01:08:18,228 --> 01:08:20,856
Let's start making our rounds.

668
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:26,525
I'm luckier than most.
Not as lucky as some.

669
01:09:28,999 --> 01:09:31,331
- I know something about that.
- You, Jerome?

670
01:09:32,036 --> 01:09:34,937
What heart problem
did you ever have?

671
01:09:35,005 --> 01:09:37,098
Did you get yours broken once?

672
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:44,047
I had this crazy idea...

673
01:09:45,449 --> 01:09:48,384
that you were more interested
in the murder case than me.

674
01:09:49,153 --> 01:09:50,586
You're right.

675
01:09:53,957 --> 01:09:55,652
That's a crazy idea.

676
01:09:59,229 --> 01:10:00,787
Would you like to dance?

677
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:40,333
It's funny.

678
01:10:40,405 --> 01:10:41,895
You work so hard...

679
01:10:41,973 --> 01:10:45,773
and you do everything you can
to get away from a place...

680
01:10:45,844 --> 01:10:48,779
and when you finally
get your chance to leave...

681
01:10:50,115 --> 01:10:52,242
you find a reason to stay.

682
01:10:57,989 --> 01:11:00,082
Ayear is a long time.

683
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,753
Not so long.
Just once around the sun.

684
01:11:15,073 --> 01:11:16,506
Hello, everyone!

685
01:11:16,574 --> 01:11:20,442
I'm your detective for the evening.
Please don't leave the premises.

686
01:11:22,881 --> 01:11:25,543
I said nobody leave!
Am I speaking...

687
01:11:25,617 --> 01:11:27,881
in some strange foreign language?

688
01:11:27,952 --> 01:11:29,977
Check for hairpieces, lenses, dentures.

689
01:11:30,055 --> 01:11:34,219
I want napkins. I want cigarette butts.
I want the saliva off teacups.

690
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:38,623
That's a familiar face.
Check him out, will you?

691
01:11:43,068 --> 01:11:45,161
I thought you wanted to dance.

692
01:11:45,236 --> 01:11:48,228
- Excuse me. Where are you going?
- Yeah, I know. Just a minute.

693
01:12:00,819 --> 01:12:03,310
- Are you insane?
- Come on!

694
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:23,771
Where did they go?

695
01:12:29,614 --> 01:12:31,548
Come here. Come on.

696
01:12:43,361 --> 01:12:46,797
- Don't you understand? I can't do that.
- You just did.

697
01:12:47,699 --> 01:12:51,100
Don't touch your face!
Don't swallow! Don't spit!

698
01:12:51,169 --> 01:12:53,103
Let's clean his teeth.

699
01:13:11,422 --> 01:13:13,185
Who's Vincent?

700
01:13:24,903 --> 01:13:26,837
Don't say anything.

701
01:16:23,514 --> 01:16:25,243
What happened?

702
01:16:28,786 --> 01:16:30,720
The scars on your legs?

703
01:16:35,326 --> 01:16:38,591
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron?

704
01:16:38,663 --> 01:16:42,326
This is the exact height
of the front fender.

705
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,028
I looked left instead of right.

706
01:16:48,639 --> 01:16:51,631
Did you just make that up,
or do you use it all the time?

707
01:16:51,709 --> 01:16:53,939
I use it all the time.

708
01:16:55,847 --> 01:16:58,941
I know you had something to do
with the director's death.

709
01:16:59,017 --> 01:17:00,882
That's not true, Irene.

710
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:12,495
Isn't that the man from last night?

711
01:17:14,966 --> 01:17:17,161
He's nobody.

712
01:17:26,811 --> 01:17:29,473
He's one of our best.

713
01:17:29,547 --> 01:17:32,641
I'm certain he has nothing
to do with this business.

714
01:17:46,597 --> 01:17:49,930
You don't look well, Jerome.

715
01:17:50,001 --> 01:17:52,196
Why don't you go home?

716
01:18:02,947 --> 01:18:05,814
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking forJerome Morrow.

717
01:18:05,883 --> 01:18:09,512
I'm sorry. He's ill with nausea.
It's quite common before a mission.

718
01:18:09,587 --> 01:18:11,521
Really?

719
01:18:11,589 --> 01:18:15,525
I ought to pay him a visit.
I understand you can show me the way.

720
01:19:00,204 --> 01:19:02,172
You don't know who he is, do you?

721
01:19:21,492 --> 01:19:22,925
Hello?

722
01:19:22,994 --> 01:19:25,622
Eugene, I need you
to be yourself for the day.

723
01:19:25,696 --> 01:19:28,187
I was never very good at it,
remember?

724
01:19:28,266 --> 01:19:31,167
The investigators are coming by.
I'm supposed to be sick.

725
01:19:31,235 --> 01:19:34,500
So you keep telling me.
How long have I got?

726
01:19:34,572 --> 01:19:36,005
Not iong.

727
01:21:24,015 --> 01:21:25,778
I guess he's not home.

728
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:31,620
- Heiio?
- I'm here to seeJerome Morrow.

729
01:21:31,689 --> 01:21:33,657
Yes, that's me.
Come up.

730
01:21:35,526 --> 01:21:37,460
I guess he's home.

731
01:22:12,496 --> 01:22:14,327
Come in!

732
01:22:20,338 --> 01:22:21,805
Hello, sweetheart.

733
01:22:25,009 --> 01:22:26,306
Where's my kiss?

734
01:22:30,648 --> 01:22:33,617
Good to see you're feeling better.

735
01:22:34,552 --> 01:22:37,180
Of course. Now that you're here.

736
01:22:45,763 --> 01:22:47,697
Who's your friend?

737
01:22:49,333 --> 01:22:51,267
How can I help?

738
01:22:51,335 --> 01:22:53,565
It's about the director.

739
01:22:53,637 --> 01:22:55,502
Oh. Again?

740
01:22:55,573 --> 01:22:58,565
- I hope it's no trouble.
- No. No trouble.

741
01:22:59,744 --> 01:23:02,304
Forgive me for not giving you
a guided tour.

742
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:05,679
- Couldn't we do this another time?
- This won't take a moment.

743
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:08,651
Maybe he can tell me what I've got.

744
01:23:45,756 --> 01:23:47,383
Who were you expecting?

745
01:24:30,367 --> 01:24:32,301
- Yes?
- We have our man, sir.

746
01:24:32,369 --> 01:24:33,893
- You have him?
- We have him in custody.

747
01:24:33,971 --> 01:24:35,905
I'll come right away.

748
01:25:00,164 --> 01:25:01,859
How are you, Jerome?

749
01:25:01,932 --> 01:25:03,866
Not bad, Jerome.

750
01:25:07,137 --> 01:25:10,368
- How the hell did you get up here?
- Oh, I could always walk.

751
01:25:10,441 --> 01:25:12,602
I've been faking it.

752
01:25:31,929 --> 01:25:33,988
- Don't touch me!
- Listen to me.

753
01:25:34,064 --> 01:25:35,998
I don't even know who you are.

754
01:25:36,066 --> 01:25:38,728
I'm the same person I was yesterday.

755
01:25:38,802 --> 01:25:41,737
I can't hear any more
of your lies, Jerome.

756
01:25:41,805 --> 01:25:45,070
My name is Vincent!
I am Vincent Anton Freeman.

757
01:25:45,142 --> 01:25:48,669
I'm a faith birth, de-gene-erate,
whatever you want to call it.

758
01:25:48,746 --> 01:25:51,681
But I am not a murderer.

759
01:25:52,783 --> 01:25:54,341
You're a God child?

760
01:25:56,353 --> 01:25:58,981
But we do have one thing in common.

761
01:25:59,056 --> 01:26:03,584
Only I don't have 20 or 30 years left.
Mine is already 10,000 beats overdue.

762
01:26:04,762 --> 01:26:07,822
- It's not possible.
- You are the authority...

763
01:26:07,898 --> 01:26:11,356
on what is not possible,
aren't you, Irene?

764
01:26:14,071 --> 01:26:17,131
They have got you looking
so hard for any flaw...

765
01:26:17,207 --> 01:26:19,607
that after a while
that's all that you see.

766
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:24,844
For whatever it's worth...

767
01:26:24,915 --> 01:26:27,941
I'm here to tell you
that it is possible.

768
01:26:29,086 --> 01:26:31,020
It is possible.

769
01:27:10,127 --> 01:27:13,028
Congratulations, sir.
We did it.

770
01:27:14,098 --> 01:27:16,896
His spit was found
in the dead director's eye.

771
01:27:16,967 --> 01:27:20,994
While I was busy obsessing
about an eyelash, your instincts...

772
01:27:21,071 --> 01:27:23,596
took us in the right direction.

773
01:27:23,674 --> 01:27:27,007
So the In-Valid had nothing
to do with this?

774
01:27:27,077 --> 01:27:30,137
Our friend here acted alone.
This mission meant everything to him.

775
01:27:30,214 --> 01:27:32,273
Didn't it?

776
01:27:35,919 --> 01:27:39,685
If they miss this launch window,
he won't live to see the next one.

777
01:27:39,757 --> 01:27:44,285
And since nothing can stop the launch
now, he's being very cooperative.

778
01:27:48,499 --> 01:27:49,932
So I imagine...

779
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,833
you'll be celebrating tonight, sir.

780
01:27:52,903 --> 01:27:54,336
Of course.

781
01:28:10,954 --> 01:28:12,387
I think she likes us.

782
01:28:14,224 --> 01:28:17,455
Yeah, sure. Just give her a little time.
She'll get used to the idea.

783
01:28:18,529 --> 01:28:21,464
- What was he like?
- Who? The cop?

784
01:28:21,532 --> 01:28:23,966
- He was just a cop.
- Did you catch his name?

785
01:28:24,034 --> 01:28:25,626
My name was the topic.

786
01:28:25,703 --> 01:28:27,728
Yeah, well, he'll be back.

787
01:28:27,805 --> 01:28:29,739
They have their man.
It's over.

788
01:28:29,807 --> 01:28:33,368
No, it's not over.
I have to meet him.

789
01:29:11,749 --> 01:29:13,683
My God, you have changed.

790
01:29:17,755 --> 01:29:20,383
Don't you recognize your own brother?

791
01:29:21,291 --> 01:29:22,724
Are we brothers?

792
01:29:22,793 --> 01:29:26,320
Our parents both died
thinking they'd outlived you.

793
01:29:27,431 --> 01:29:28,864
I had my doubts.

794
01:29:28,932 --> 01:29:31,196
What are you doing here, Anton?

795
01:29:31,268 --> 01:29:33,600
I should ask you that question.

796
01:29:33,670 --> 01:29:36,798
I have a right to be here.
You don't.

797
01:29:38,909 --> 01:29:42,174
You almost sound
as if you believe that.

798
01:29:42,246 --> 01:29:47,081
I committed no murder.
You must be disappointed.

799
01:29:47,951 --> 01:29:49,543
You committed fraud.

800
01:29:52,022 --> 01:29:54,388
You're in trouble.
I can get you out of here.

801
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:57,120
Do you have any idea
what it took to get in here?

802
01:29:57,194 --> 01:29:59,890
You've gone as far as you can go.
Come with me now!

803
01:30:01,098 --> 01:30:03,328
There is still a few million
miles left to go.

804
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:04,890
It's over!

805
01:30:04,968 --> 01:30:08,062
Is that the only way you can succeed
is to see me fail?

806
01:30:08,138 --> 01:30:12,370
God! Even you are gonna tell me
what I can and can't do now!

807
01:30:13,977 --> 01:30:17,936
In case you haven't noticed,
I don't need any rescuing.

808
01:30:18,982 --> 01:30:20,574
But you did once.

809
01:30:22,653 --> 01:30:26,919
Well, you've got all the answers.
How do you explain that?

810
01:30:26,990 --> 01:30:29,322
You didn't beat me that day.
I beat myself.

811
01:30:30,427 --> 01:30:32,361
Who are you trying to convince?

812
01:30:33,497 --> 01:30:35,431
Do you want me
to prove it to you?

813
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:40,200
It's not important, Anton.
It's forgotten.

814
01:30:41,471 --> 01:30:45,601
Do you want me to prove it to you?
I'll prove it to you!

815
01:30:45,676 --> 01:30:47,337
I do.

816
01:31:58,615 --> 01:32:00,048
Where's the shore?

817
01:32:00,117 --> 01:32:02,278
- You wanna quit?
- We're too far out!

818
01:32:32,015 --> 01:32:35,246
How are you doing this?

819
01:32:35,319 --> 01:32:38,117
How have you done any of this?

820
01:32:38,188 --> 01:32:41,123
- We have to go back.
- It's too late for that.

821
01:32:41,191 --> 01:32:43,352
We're closer to the other side.

822
01:32:43,427 --> 01:32:45,861
What other side?
You wanna drown us both?

823
01:32:47,331 --> 01:32:50,027
You wanna know how I did it?

824
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:54,730
This is how I did it, Anton. I never
saved anything for the swim back.

825
01:34:39,676 --> 01:34:42,406
You couldn't see, could you?

826
01:34:42,479 --> 01:34:45,312
That night, crossing the street.

827
01:34:47,017 --> 01:34:48,951
You crossed anyway.

828
01:35:03,934 --> 01:35:05,367
If you're still interested...

829
01:35:07,204 --> 01:35:08,637
let me know.

830
01:35:15,278 --> 01:35:16,711
Sorry.

831
01:35:21,618 --> 01:35:23,882
The wind caught it.

832
01:36:17,274 --> 01:36:20,072
You're flying today, aren't you?

833
01:36:20,143 --> 01:36:23,078
Look at what a mess you're in.

834
01:36:25,882 --> 01:36:28,817
Come on.
I have your samples ready.

835
01:36:29,953 --> 01:36:32,046
I don't need any samples
where I'm going.

836
01:36:36,459 --> 01:36:38,757
You might when you get back.

837
01:36:41,932 --> 01:36:44,924
Everything you need
to last you two lifetimes.

838
01:36:47,604 --> 01:36:49,538
Why have you done all this?

839
01:36:50,907 --> 01:36:53,967
SoJerome will always be here
when you need him.

840
01:36:54,044 --> 01:36:58,071
- Where are you going?
- I'm traveling too.

841
01:37:01,818 --> 01:37:04,412
I don't know how to thank you.

842
01:37:07,924 --> 01:37:10,358
I got the better end of the deal.

843
01:37:10,427 --> 01:37:12,657
I only lent you my body.

844
01:37:14,064 --> 01:37:16,191
You lent me your dream.

845
01:37:26,243 --> 01:37:28,609
Not until you're upstairs.

846
01:38:01,444 --> 01:38:02,877
What is this?

847
01:38:02,946 --> 01:38:04,538
New policy.

848
01:38:11,321 --> 01:38:13,414
Flight got you nervous?

849
01:38:15,058 --> 01:38:17,754
Well, there's a problem, Lamar.

850
01:38:17,827 --> 01:38:21,729
I never told you about my son, did I?
He's a big fan of yours.

851
01:38:26,336 --> 01:38:28,201
Just remember...

852
01:38:28,271 --> 01:38:31,934
that I was as good as any
and better than most.

853
01:38:32,008 --> 01:38:34,101
He wants to apply here.

854
01:38:34,177 --> 01:38:38,238
I could've gone up and back,
and nobody would've been the wiser.

855
01:38:39,082 --> 01:38:42,518
Unfortunately, my son's
not all that they promised.

856
01:38:44,387 --> 01:38:46,787
But then, who knows
what he could do?

857
01:38:48,391 --> 01:38:50,052
Right?

858
01:39:06,843 --> 01:39:09,437
For future reference...

859
01:39:09,512 --> 01:39:12,777
right-handed men
don't hold it with their left.

860
01:39:12,849 --> 01:39:15,215
Just one of those things.

861
01:39:28,298 --> 01:39:30,630
You're gonna miss your flight, Vincent.

862
01:42:17,033 --> 01:42:19,593
For someone who was never
meant for this worid...

863
01:42:19,669 --> 01:42:23,503
I must confess I'm suddeniy
having a hard time ieaving it.

864
01:42:26,409 --> 01:42:30,470
Of course, they say every atom
in our bodies was once part of a star.

865
01:42:31,981 --> 01:42:34,381
Maybe I'm not ieaving.

866
01:42:34,450 --> 01:42:36,384
Maybe I'm going home.
