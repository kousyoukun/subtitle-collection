1
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:46,891
September 1939, the German forces defeated the Polish Army in two weeks.

2
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:51,931
Jews were ordered to register all family members

3
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:53,381
and relocate to major cities.

4
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:57,491
More than 10,000 Jews from the countryside arrive in Krakow daily.

5
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:16,701
Name?

6
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:18,981
Horowitz, Salomon.

7
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:30,561
Over there. Over there!

8
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:36,091
Isak Hudes. Hudes, Isak.

9
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:38,011
Zucker, Helena.

10
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:40,711
Zucker, Helena.

11
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:43,591
Hirsch, Salomon? Hirsch, Salomon.

12
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:44,551
Hauptman, Chaim!

13
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:47,231
Weisman! Weisman, Marcus!

14
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:50,111
Feber, Ludwig! Feber, Ludwig.

15
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:52,601
Elsa Bauman.

16
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:55,111
Josef Klein. -Klein.

17
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:57,031
Davidowich, Ignacy.

18
00:02:57,031 --> 00:02:57,991
Paula Biffer.

19
00:02:57,991 --> 00:02:59,301
Nadel, Rachela.

20
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:02,281
Steiner, Gertruda. Steiner, Hilda.

21
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:57,101
Jerzy, you know who that man is?

22
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:58,631
I don't know.

23
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:19,281
Let's get together, please.

24
00:05:19,281 --> 00:05:21,191
Smile. Good.

25
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,961
Yes, sir.

26
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,621
Bring them over a round of drinks.

27
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:01,891
Very good, sir. And who shall I say th-they are from?

28
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:05,151
You can say they are from me.

29
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:26,951
From the gentleman.

30
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:28,581
Where?

31
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:35,591
Do you know him?

32
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:38,741
Find out who he is.

33
00:06:38,741 --> 00:06:39,991
Yes, sir.

34
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:45,201
Agnieszka

35
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:47,981
I would give anything to hear you sing tonight.

36
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:50,441
But I know you won't.

37
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,311
You embarrass me.

38
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:04,681
What's he doing?

39
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:08,521
Stay here.

40
00:07:12,371 --> 00:07:14,001
How are you doing?

41
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:17,131
You'd leave a woman alone at the table in a place like this?

42
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:21,281
Sweetheart, you're the picture of loneliness.

43
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:26,091
Mmm, what a lovely fragrance. You are breaking my heart.

44
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:28,401
An extra chair, please. Vodka for my friend.

45
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:30,321
And for the lady?

46
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:32,231
Pernod.

47
00:07:40,891 --> 00:07:44,231
Come to the table, girls! Drink with us!

48
00:07:49,531 --> 00:07:52,201
Come to us! Marry us!

49
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:14,671
-Thank you. -I'll tell you what I mean by cooperative.

50
00:08:14,671 --> 00:08:16,881
Two days after the law is passed that allJews have to wear the star...

51
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:18,801
theJewish tailors are turning them out by the gross

52
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:20,241
in a variety of fabrics at three zloty each.

53
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:22,161
Tell me about your cellar wines.

54
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:25,141
I have an excellent German Riesling. 1937.

55
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:26,001
Mmm, French.

56
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:27,701
A Bordeaux. Chateau Latour, '28, '29?

57
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:28,791
No, I'm sorry.

58
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,241
It's as if they have no idea what kind of law it is.

59
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:33,681
As if it's the emblem of a riding club.

60
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:36,001
-A Margaux, '29? -No, no, we don't have that.

61
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:38,431
-Burgundy then? A Romanee-Conti, '37? -Yes.

62
00:08:38,491 --> 00:08:41,361
It's human nature. "We'll do this to avoid that."

63
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:43,761
That's what they have done since thousands of years. It's what they do.

64
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:45,771
They weather the storm.

65
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:47,601
But this storm is different.

66
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:50,091
This is not the Romans. This storm is the SS.

67
00:09:19,161 --> 00:09:21,231
Martin?

68
00:09:21,231 --> 00:09:23,311
Yes, sir.

69
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:25,121
Who is that man?

70
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:28,591
That... That's Oskar Schindler!

71
00:10:37,431 --> 00:10:39,861
The Jewish Council

72
00:10:39,861 --> 00:10:42,831
comprised of 24 elected Jews personally responsible for

73
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:45,811
carrying out the orders of the regime in Krakow

74
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,301
such as drawing up lists for work details

75
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:49,361
food and housing.

76
00:10:49,361 --> 00:10:51,661
A place to lodge complaints.

77
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:54,801
Private property cannot be confiscated.

78
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:55,931
How long are the schools going to be closed?

79
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:56,721
I do not know.

80
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:59,011
You don't know anything!

81
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:01,531
I am familiar with the Hague Convention.

82
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:05,361
They come into our house and tell us we don't live there anymore.

83
00:11:05,361 --> 00:11:08,241
It now belongs to a certain SS officer.

84
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:10,731
Please. I only know what they tell me.

85
00:11:10,731 --> 00:11:14,001
And what they tell me changes from day to day.

86
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:16,371
Aren't you supposed to be able to help?

87
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:21,691
I mean, what if I just took this thing off?

88
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:25,611
What are they going to do about it? They will shoot you.

89
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:28,771
I'm looking for Itzhak Stern.

90
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,561
Are you Itzhak Stern or not?

91
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,501
I am.

92
00:11:35,501 --> 00:11:37,511
Where can we talk?

93
00:11:46,641 --> 00:11:50,051
There's a company you did the books for on Lipowa Street.

94
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:53,171
Made what? Pots and pans?

95
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:56,111
By law, I have to tell you, sir, I'm a Jew.

96
00:11:56,241 --> 00:11:58,691
Well, I'm a German. So there we are.

97
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:04,131
A good company, you think?

98
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:05,951
Modestly successful.

99
00:12:06,171 --> 00:12:08,681
I know nothing about enamelware. Do you?

100
00:12:08,731 --> 00:12:10,281
I was just the accountant.

101
00:12:11,181 --> 00:12:13,041
Simple engineering though, wouldn't you think?

102
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,571
Change the machines around,

103
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:16,621
whatever you do you could make other things, couldn't you?

104
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,671
Field kits, mess kits.

105
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:21,941
Army contracts.

106
00:12:23,971 --> 00:12:25,981
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great.

107
00:12:25,981 --> 00:12:27,931
You can make a fortune, don't you think?

108
00:12:27,931 --> 00:12:31,141
I think most people right now have other priorities.

109
00:12:31,761 --> 00:12:33,501
Like what?

110
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:36,561
I'm sure you'll do just fine once you get the contracts.

111
00:12:36,561 --> 00:12:38,491
In fact, the worse things get, the better you'll do.

112
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:42,321
Oh, well, I can get the signatures I need. That's the easy part.

113
00:12:42,321 --> 00:12:46,041
Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.

114
00:12:46,161 --> 00:12:48,081
You don't have any money?

115
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:49,721
Not that kind of money.

116
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:51,971
You know anybody?

117
00:12:53,491 --> 00:12:56,231
Jews, yeah. Investors.

118
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:59,601
You must have contacts in theJewish business community working here.

119
00:12:59,601 --> 00:13:02,481
What community? Jews can no longer own businesses.

120
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:04,961
That's why this one's in receivership. But they wouldn't own it.

121
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:08,011
I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product... pots and pans.

122
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:09,201
Pots and pans.

123
00:13:09,201 --> 00:13:11,951
Something they can use.

124
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:15,051
They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want.

125
00:13:15,051 --> 00:13:16,491
Everybody's happy.

126
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:21,331
If you want, you could run the company for me.

127
00:13:25,531 --> 00:13:27,441
Let me understand.

128
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:31,281
They'd put up all the money, I'd do all the work.

129
00:13:31,281 --> 00:13:33,191
What, if you don't mind my asking, would you do?

130
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:36,131
I'd make sure it's known the company's in business.

131
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:38,151
I'd see that it had a certain panache.

132
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,641
That's what I'm good at, not the work. Not the work.

133
00:13:41,841 --> 00:13:44,131
The presentation.

134
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:05,421
I'm sure I don't know anybody who'll be interested in this.

135
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:10,051
Well, they should be, Itzhak Stern.

136
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:13,121
Tell them they should be.

137
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:47,121
I've got a client who'll sell marks for zloty at 2.45 to 1.

138
00:14:47,121 --> 00:14:50,961
Wool, mink collar. It's a nice coat. She'll trade it for ration coupons.

139
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:52,881
-Wicks, for lamps. -You have a truckload of wicks?

140
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:56,721
What am I going to do with a truckload of wicks?

141
00:14:56,721 --> 00:14:58,821
Nine by 12, nine by 14.

142
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:07,651
You don't recognize this?

143
00:15:07,651 --> 00:15:08,621
It's shoe polish.

144
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:09,861
In metal containers?

145
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:11,321
You asked for shoe polish.

146
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:13,041
In metal containers. This is glass.

147
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,391
-It's not what I asked for. -What's the difference?

148
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:15,901
What's the difference?

149
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:17,231
What's the difference?

150
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:20,731
My client sold it to his client who sold it to the German Army.

151
00:15:20,731 --> 00:15:23,891
Only by the time it got there, because of the freezing cold, it broke.

152
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:25,881
All 10  000 units.

153
00:15:26,381 --> 00:15:27,441
This is not my problem.

154
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:29,361
This is not his problem. This is not your problem?

155
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,081
-This is not my problem.

156
00:15:33,011 --> 00:15:35,851
The German Army wants to find out where it came from.

157
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:38,001
I am going to make sure they find out.

158
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:39,051
Now it's your problem.

159
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:40,681
You be quiet!

160
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:44,521
Metal containers.

161
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:51,621
Pardon me for interfering, but that's a nice shirt.

162
00:15:51,921 --> 00:15:53,721
Nice shirt.

163
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:57,571
Do you know where I can find a nice shirt like that?

164
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:05,931
Like this?

165
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:10,551
It's illegal to buy or sell anything on the street. We don't do that.

166
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:12,741
We're here to pray.

167
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,241
Do you have any idea how much a shirt like this costs?

168
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:22,251
Nice things cost money.

169
00:16:35,021 --> 00:16:36,931
How many?

170
00:16:38,011 --> 00:16:40,751
I'm going to need some other things, too, as things come up.

171
00:16:41,271 --> 00:16:42,351
This won't be a problem.

172
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:44,131
From time to time.

173
00:16:48,781 --> 00:16:53,571
MARCH 20, 1941 DEADLINE FOR ENTERING THE GHETTO

174
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:54,673
Edict 44/91

175
00:16:54,674 --> 00:16:56,511
establishes a closed Jewish district south of the Vistula River.

176
00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:59,441
Residency in the walled ghetto is compulsory.

177
00:16:59,441 --> 00:17:02,371
All Jews from Krakow and surrounding areas are forced

178
00:17:02,371 --> 00:17:05,691
from their homes and required to crowd into an area of only 16 square blocks.

179
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:31,381
Name? Adresse? Formular ausfUllen!

180
00:17:31,381 --> 00:17:32,991
Weiter, weiter.! Nicht drangeln.!

181
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:36,421
-Kommen Sie hierher.! -Stellen Sie sich doch an.!

182
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:24,531
Achtung, Achtung! AlleJuden sind verpflichtet...

183
00:18:24,531 --> 00:18:28,181
im abgesonderten jUdischen Bezirk zu wohnen.

184
00:18:28,181 --> 00:18:32,241
Nichteinhaltung der Meldepflicht bei der Einwohnerbehorde...

185
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:35,121
verstoBt gegen das Edikt 44/91 und fUhrt zur Anzeige...

186
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:37,031
beim Militargericht.

187
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:42,671
-This is obviously the right place. How are you doing? -Herr Schindler.

188
00:18:46,451 --> 00:18:50,451
Good-bye, Jews.! Good-bye, Jews.!

189
00:18:50,451 --> 00:18:54,631
Good-bye, Jews! Good-bye, Jews!

190
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,451
Good-bye, Jews.!

191
00:18:58,451 --> 00:19:03,371
Good-bye, Jews.! Good-bye, Jews.!

192
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:25,171
Oh, my God.

193
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:28,851
Oy, God. Oh, my God.

194
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:38,091
Oh, my God.

195
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:46,031
It could not be better.

196
00:19:46,161 --> 00:19:47,971
-It could be worse. -How? Tell me.

197
00:19:49,531 --> 00:19:53,061
How on earth could it possibly be worse?

198
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:10,931
-Hey, Goldberg. -Poldek.

199
00:20:10,931 --> 00:20:13,041
-What's this? -Uh, the Judenrat has its own police now.

200
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,851
-You don't say. -Ordnungsdienst.

201
00:20:15,441 --> 00:20:18,331
I'm a policeman now, could you believe it? It's hard to believe.

202
00:20:18,331 --> 00:20:20,241
Oh, no, it's not hard to believe.

203
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:22,451
It's a good racket, Poldek. The only racket here.

204
00:20:22,451 --> 00:20:25,901
Look, maybe I could put in a good word for you with my superiors.

205
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:27,261
Your superiors?

206
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:29,601
Come on, they are not as bad as everyone says.

207
00:20:30,231 --> 00:20:34,051
Well, they're worse than everyone says, but it's a lot of money.

208
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:35,791
A lot of money.

209
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,191
Give me my housing assignment.

210
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:42,391
You look funny in that hat, Goldberg.

211
00:20:43,471 --> 00:20:45,671
You look like a clown, you know?

212
00:20:51,921 --> 00:20:54,991
He's a very important man. Just give him two minutes of your time.

213
00:20:54,991 --> 00:20:57,201
Since when did time cost money? Just sit down and listen.

214
00:20:57,201 --> 00:20:59,981
Please. Sir?

215
00:21:04,011 --> 00:21:06,331
For each thousand you invest, I will repay you with...

216
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,801
Two hundred. 200 kilos of enamelware a month

217
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,161
to begin in July and to continue for one year.

218
00:21:10,161 --> 00:21:14,001
After which time, we're even. That's it. It's very simple.

219
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:16,291
-Not good enough. -It's not good enough.

220
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:18,861
Not good enough?

221
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:21,561
Look where you're living. Look where you've been put.

222
00:21:21,561 --> 00:21:22,831
"Not good enough."

223
00:21:22,831 --> 00:21:25,481
A couple of months ago you'd be right, not anymore.

224
00:21:25,621 --> 00:21:28,011
Money's still money.

225
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:34,161
No, it is not. That's why we're here.

226
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:38,001
Trade goods that's the only currency that'll be worth anything in the ghetto.

227
00:21:38,001 --> 00:21:40,361
Things have changed, my friend.

228
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:44,781
Did I call this meeting?

229
00:21:45,111 --> 00:21:47,111
You told Mr. Stern you wanted to speak to me.

230
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:48,941
I'm here. I've made you a fair offer.

231
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,061
Fair would be a percentage in the company.

232
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:53,611
Forget the whole thing.

233
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:57,961
Get out.

234
00:22:02,961 --> 00:22:05,811
How do we know that you will do what you say?

235
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:09,681
Because I said I would. You want a contract? To be upheld by what court?

236
00:22:09,681 --> 00:22:12,261
I said what I'll do. That's our contract.

237
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:53,221
The standard SS rate forJewish skilled laborers is seven marks a day...

238
00:22:53,361 --> 00:22:55,641
five for unskilled and women.

239
00:22:56,151 --> 00:22:59,311
This is what you pay the Reich Economic Office.

240
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,771
TheJews themselves receive nothing.

241
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:06,201
Poles you pay wages. Generally, they get a little more.

242
00:23:06,221 --> 00:23:07,381
-Are you listening? -What was that about the SS?

243
00:23:07,381 --> 00:23:10,731
The rate? The what?

244
00:23:10,731 --> 00:23:12,851
TheJewish worker's salary you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker.

245
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:15,351
He gets nothing. -But it's less.

246
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:18,111
It's less than what I would pay a Pole. -It's less.

247
00:23:18,511 --> 00:23:20,971
That's the point I'm trying to make.

248
00:23:21,591 --> 00:23:23,371
Poles cost more.

249
00:23:24,851 --> 00:23:27,331
Why should I hire Poles?

250
00:23:28,211 --> 00:23:32,241
An enamelware factory over at, uh, Lipowa Street.

251
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:35,891
It, uh, it, um... It's owned by a German.

252
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:37,901
But it's outside the ghetto, so you can barter for extra goods...

253
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:39,931
for eggs, I don't know what you need with the Polish workers.

254
00:23:39,931 --> 00:23:42,321
You can't get it here.

255
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:45,731
Also, he's asking for ten healthy women for the...

256
00:23:45,731 --> 00:23:47,591
-I am healthy.

257
00:23:47,981 --> 00:23:50,001
Bring your sister, okay?

258
00:23:56,141 --> 00:23:57,711
You need to convince them you have a trade

259
00:23:57,711 --> 00:23:59,321
something valuable to the war effort.

260
00:23:59,321 --> 00:24:00,161
Like what?  What if you don't?

261
00:24:00,161 --> 00:24:01,041
I'm a musician.

262
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,581
Your name goes on a list.

263
00:24:02,581 --> 00:24:05,171
And they put you on trucks...

264
00:24:05,171 --> 00:24:06,121
No, no, no, that's not true.

265
00:24:06,121 --> 00:24:07,541
You're a musician?

266
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:09,881
-Yeah. -I'd find a good hiding place if I were you.

267
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:12,081
I'm not going to hide like some animal.

268
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:14,091
There are places to hide.

269
00:24:20,441 --> 00:24:23,001
I'm a graduate of the University of Lwow.

270
00:24:23,981 --> 00:24:26,671
I used to work at the hydroelectric station in Roznow...

271
00:24:26,671 --> 00:24:28,301
Blauschein.

272
00:24:32,051 --> 00:24:35,791
I'm gonna get the necessary papers because this card is no good anymore.

273
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:40,011
You can stay in this line all day, you'll still get one of these.

274
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:44,241
They are no good. You'll have to leave the line now then you'll get a blue card

275
00:24:44,241 --> 00:24:46,351
a Blauschein, to say that you are an essential worker.

276
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:49,321
I'll get these papers for you at Pankiewicz.

277
00:24:49,711 --> 00:24:51,431
Pharmacist. Just there, look.

278
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:53,711
Guess who is here?

279
00:24:54,611 --> 00:24:56,011
Poldek! Enjoying the weather, Poldek?

280
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:57,301
Enjoying the lines?

281
00:24:57,301 --> 00:24:58,641
Need some shoe polish?

282
00:24:58,641 --> 00:25:00,531
In a metal container maybe?

283
00:25:01,331 --> 00:25:05,931
Not essential? I think you misunderstand the meaning of the word.

284
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:10,151
No Blauschein, sir. Stand over there.  Move. Next!

285
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:13,591
What do you mean, "Not essential"?

286
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:19,271
I teach history and literature. Since when it's not essential?

287
00:25:24,361 --> 00:25:26,081
He's a metal polisher.

288
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:34,351
-It was not right? -It's very good.

289
00:25:34,351 --> 00:25:37,421
He's 53 years old. It's too new.

290
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:48,941
You're crazy. You left it in your drawer.

291
00:25:48,941 --> 00:25:51,141
How many times have I told you?

292
00:25:51,151 --> 00:25:54,411
Your work certificate you keep in your pocket at all times.

293
00:25:55,081 --> 00:25:55,761
And you leave everything in your drawer.

294
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:57,841
How many times I've told you?

295
00:25:59,021 --> 00:26:01,121
I'm a metal polisher.

296
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:12,621
Take the round sheet of tin...

297
00:26:13,141 --> 00:26:15,911
dip it in soap emulsion.

298
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:20,731
Then place it centrally in the press.

299
00:26:35,601 --> 00:26:39,281
We obtain the soup pot. The soup pot.

300
00:26:39,441 --> 00:26:41,161
Soup pot.

301
00:26:42,711 --> 00:26:45,191
Grosz, Mrs. Grosz, stay together.

302
00:26:49,221 --> 00:26:54,421
Sir, I have ten work permits here for the Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik...

303
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:57,391
cosigned by Mr. Bankier and myself.

304
00:26:57,391 --> 00:27:01,691
If it's carbonized, clean it with a file.

305
00:27:02,361 --> 00:27:06,721
But don't touch both the electrodes at the same time.

306
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:09,881
You'll get electrocuted. Here, have a try.

307
00:27:13,621 --> 00:27:16,081
Roll the metal under the press...

308
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:18,801
but be very careful unless you want your fingers...

309
00:27:18,801 --> 00:27:20,961
to become part of the teapot.

310
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:23,911
Occupation?

311
00:27:23,911 --> 00:27:26,291
I'm a writer. I play the flute.

312
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:29,931
But Moses is a skilled metalworker.

313
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:32,141
He can make tin pots. He can make tanks.

314
00:27:32,141 --> 00:27:34,161
He can make whatever Mr. Schindler asks.

315
00:27:34,161 --> 00:27:35,021
He's highly skilled. Give him your card.

316
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:38,181
Moses, give him your card.

317
00:27:40,691 --> 00:27:45,091
Now, dip the basin with the tongs into the enamel solution.

318
00:27:47,311 --> 00:27:51,631
And after swiveling it around, carefully place it aside to drip-dry.

319
00:27:54,421 --> 00:27:58,161
And whatever he asks you, allow me just to represent you and speak for you.

320
00:27:58,161 --> 00:28:00,181
Don't say a word.

321
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:02,471
Filing, billing

322
00:28:02,471 --> 00:28:04,881
keeping track of my appointments, shorthand. Typing, obviously.

323
00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:06,611
How is your typing?

324
00:28:06,611 --> 00:28:07,661
Uh, all right.

325
00:28:07,661 --> 00:28:08,991
Please.

326
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:02,831
You need a secretary. Pick one.

327
00:29:04,211 --> 00:29:06,521
I don't know how.

328
00:29:06,521 --> 00:29:08,301
They're all so qualified.

329
00:29:08,821 --> 00:29:10,541
You have to choose.

330
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:16,291
Big smile. Big smile.

331
00:29:38,001 --> 00:29:39,921
If you would, look after my guest.

332
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:44,131
Um, boxed teas are good. Coffee, pate, um...

333
00:29:44,341 --> 00:29:47,941
-kielbasa sausage, cheeses, Beluga caviar. -Yes.

334
00:29:48,561 --> 00:29:50,471
And, of course, who could live without German cigarettes?

335
00:29:50,471 --> 00:29:51,721
Get me as many as you can find.

336
00:29:52,781 --> 00:29:54,481
And some more fresh fruit.

337
00:29:54,521 --> 00:29:57,301
The real rarities... oranges, lemons, pineapples.

338
00:29:57,301 --> 00:30:00,181
-I need several boxes of Cuban cigars. The best. -Yes.

339
00:30:00,181 --> 00:30:01,961
And dark, unsweetened chocolate.

340
00:30:01,961 --> 00:30:03,921
Not in the shape ofladyfingers, the chunk chocolate.

341
00:30:03,921 --> 00:30:06,281
-Yes. -Big as my hand, you sample at wine tastings.

342
00:30:06,801 --> 00:30:09,681
We're going to need lots of cognac.

343
00:30:09,681 --> 00:30:11,971
The best, Hennessy.

344
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,771
Dom perignon champagne. Um, get L 'espadon sardines...

345
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:18,411
and, oh, try to find nylon stockings.

346
00:30:20,911 --> 00:30:23,511
It is my distinct pleasure to announce...

347
00:30:23,511 --> 00:30:26,671
the fully operational status of Deutsche Email Fabrik...

348
00:30:26,671 --> 00:30:29,621
Patrzjakies szmaty.!

349
00:30:29,841 --> 00:30:34,021
Manufacturers of superior enamelware crockery...

350
00:30:34,261 --> 00:30:39,111
expressly designed and crafted for military use.

351
00:30:39,181 --> 00:30:43,191
Utilizing only the most modern equipment...

352
00:30:43,191 --> 00:30:50,001
D.E.F. 's staff ofhighly skilled and experienced artisans andjourneymen...

353
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:51,921
deliver a product of unparalleled quality...

354
00:30:51,921 --> 00:30:53,841
enabling me to proffer, with absolute confidence and pride...

355
00:30:53,841 --> 00:30:56,821
a full line of field and kitchenware unsurpassable

356
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,941
in all respects by my competitors.

357
00:31:00,561 --> 00:31:03,591
See attached list and available colors.

358
00:31:04,401 --> 00:31:07,851
Anticipating the enclosed bids will meet with your approval...

359
00:31:07,851 --> 00:31:11,561
Looking forward to a long and mutually prosperous association.

360
00:31:11,701 --> 00:31:16,501
-Look at this. -I extend to you in advance my sincerest gratitude...

361
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:17,651
and very best regards. Oskar Schindler.

362
00:31:17,651 --> 00:31:21,011
Yeah, I need 700 gross from here for next Thursday.

363
00:31:21,011 --> 00:31:23,791
Nine hundred... No, make it ten for Wednesday.

364
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:27,811
All this stuff here goes to Madritsch's factory on Tuesday of next week.

365
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:46,131
My father was fond of saying, "you need three things in life.'

366
00:31:46,301 --> 00:31:48,091
"A good doctor, a forgiving priest...

367
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:52,511
and a clever accountant.

368
00:31:56,721 --> 00:32:00,181
The first two... I've never had much use for.

369
00:32:00,181 --> 00:32:02,471
But the third...

370
00:32:08,721 --> 00:32:12,261
Just pretend, for Christ's sake.

371
00:32:16,011 --> 00:32:18,031
Is that all?

372
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:25,771
I'm trying to thank you.

373
00:32:26,961 --> 00:32:30,411
I'm saying I couldn't have done this without you.

374
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:35,981
The usual thing would be to acknowledge my gratitude.

375
00:32:35,981 --> 00:32:38,271
It would also, by the way, be the courteous thing.

376
00:32:40,881 --> 00:32:42,791
You're welcome.

377
00:32:51,921 --> 00:32:53,731
Get out of here.

378
00:33:06,231 --> 00:33:09,101
Klonowska, who is it?

379
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:21,571
She's so embarrassed. Look at her.

380
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:35,121
You know something? You would like her.

381
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:37,041
-Oskar, please. -What?

382
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:38,961
-I don't have to like her... just because you do. -You would, though.

383
00:33:38,961 --> 00:33:41,161
It doesn't work that way.

384
00:33:54,751 --> 00:33:56,881
You've done well here.

385
00:33:59,021 --> 00:34:01,321
You look wonderful.

386
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:06,411
-Be careful of the step, miss.

387
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,611
-Mrs. Schindler, Marek.

388
00:34:20,651 --> 00:34:22,771
It's not a charade, all this?

389
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:24,521
How could it be a charade?

390
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:25,621
The clothes, the car, the apartment. -Wait a minute.

391
00:34:25,621 --> 00:34:29,481
-Take a guess how many people are on my payroll.,  -Oskar.

392
00:34:30,641 --> 00:34:33,601
My father, at the height of his success, had 50.

393
00:34:33,601 --> 00:34:35,601
I've got 350.

394
00:34:35,601 --> 00:34:39,971
350 workers on the factory floor, with one purpose.

395
00:34:40,401 --> 00:34:42,131
To make pots and pans?

396
00:34:42,131 --> 00:34:45,301
To make money. For me.

397
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:54,981
Does anyone ask about me?

398
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:57,871
Back home? Everybody.

399
00:34:58,061 --> 00:35:00,931
All the time.

400
00:35:06,011 --> 00:35:10,171
They won't soon forget the name Schindler here, I can tell you that.

401
00:35:12,051 --> 00:35:14,961
"Oskar Schindler  " they'll say.

402
00:35:14,961 --> 00:35:17,451
"Everybody remembers him.

403
00:35:19,001 --> 00:35:22,471
"He did something extraordinary.

404
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:25,951
"He did something no one else did.

405
00:35:28,511 --> 00:35:30,691
"He came here with nothing...

406
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:32,991
"a suitcase...

407
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:38,571
"and built a bankrupt company into a major manufactory.

408
00:35:39,921 --> 00:35:42,731
"And left with a steamer trunk...

409
00:35:42,731 --> 00:35:46,151
"Two steamer trunks full of money...

410
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:50,491
all the riches of the world."

411
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:57,201
It's comforting to see that nothing's changed.

412
00:35:57,201 --> 00:35:59,171
You're wrong, Emilie.

413
00:36:00,931 --> 00:36:03,141
There's no way I could have known this before

414
00:36:03,141 --> 00:36:05,351
but there was always something missing.

415
00:36:06,141 --> 00:36:09,551
In every business I tried, I can see now, it wasn't me that failed.

416
00:36:09,551 --> 00:36:11,891
Something was missing.

417
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:17,471
Even if I'd known what it was, there's nothing I could have done about it...

418
00:36:17,951 --> 00:36:20,351
because you can't create this thing.

419
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:25,511
And it makes all the difference in the world between success and failure.

420
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:28,471
Luck?

421
00:36:30,581 --> 00:36:32,121
War.

422
00:36:56,151 --> 00:36:58,151
Should I stay?

423
00:37:00,361 --> 00:37:02,391
It's a beautiful city.

424
00:37:04,401 --> 00:37:07,211
I asked you if I should stay.

425
00:37:09,441 --> 00:37:11,201
It's up to you.

426
00:37:15,811 --> 00:37:17,811
Promise me, Oskar, no doorman or maitre d' will ever presume...

427
00:37:17,811 --> 00:37:22,641
I'm anyone other than Mrs. Schindler

428
00:37:22,681 --> 00:37:24,731
and I'll stay.

429
00:37:27,441 --> 00:37:29,211
Good-bye, darling.

430
00:37:45,451 --> 00:37:49,631
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's still hot.

431
00:37:50,221 --> 00:37:51,451
We're doing well?

432
00:37:51,451 --> 00:37:51,951
Yes.

433
00:37:51,951 --> 00:37:52,921
Better this month than last?

434
00:37:52,921 --> 00:37:53,361
Yes.

435
00:37:53,361 --> 00:37:55,271
Any reason to think next month will be worse?

436
00:37:55,271 --> 00:37:57,211
The war could end.

437
00:38:08,771 --> 00:38:10,781
-What? -There is a machinist outside

438
00:38:10,781 --> 00:38:13,391
who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.

439
00:38:13,831 --> 00:38:17,731
Every day he comes. He's very grateful. It'll just take a minute.

440
00:38:24,081 --> 00:38:26,041
Mr. Lowenstein?

441
00:38:32,881 --> 00:38:36,051
I want to thank you, sir...

442
00:38:36,051 --> 00:38:38,481
for giving me the opportunity to work.

443
00:38:38,481 --> 00:38:41,361
You're welcome. I'm sure you're doing a great job.

444
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:46,071
The SS beat me up. They would have killed me...

445
00:38:46,231 --> 00:38:50,321
but I am essential to the war effort, thanks to you.

446
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,731
That's great.

447
00:38:52,251 --> 00:38:54,711
I work hard for you.

448
00:38:54,711 --> 00:38:55,841
I'm sure you do.

449
00:38:55,841 --> 00:38:58,641
I'll continue to work hard for you.

450
00:38:58,641 --> 00:39:00,561
That's great. Thanks.

451
00:39:00,561 --> 00:39:02,871
-God bless you, sir. -All right.

452
00:39:03,181 --> 00:39:05,631
You are a good man.

453
00:39:08,211 --> 00:39:09,371
He saved my life.

454
00:39:09,371 --> 00:39:10,801
Yes, he did.

455
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:13,101
-God bless him. -Yeah. Come on.

456
00:39:16,111 --> 00:39:18,311
God bless you.

457
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:32,861
I'm sorry, Herr Direktor, but you're running very late.

458
00:39:32,861 --> 00:39:36,081
This is for the Obersturmbannfuhrer, sir.

459
00:39:36,081 --> 00:39:38,961
And this is for his niece, Greta. It's her birthday.

460
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:41,841
-Greta as in Garbo. -By the way, don't ever do that to me again.

461
00:39:41,841 --> 00:39:44,271
Go. Go, go, drive! Don't bow.

462
00:39:44,271 --> 00:39:46,251
Did you happen to notice that that man had one arm?

463
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:47,971
What? Did he?

464
00:39:51,721 --> 00:39:54,291
What's his use? -Very useful.

465
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:57,481
How?

466
00:39:57,481 --> 00:39:59,941
Very useful! Success!

467
00:40:32,771 --> 00:40:35,111
We'll be late for work.

468
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,731
you shouldn't think of them as yours, Oskar.

469
00:40:49,731 --> 00:40:52,581
You need to understand that some of the officers here

470
00:40:52,581 --> 00:40:54,211
don't give a damn about production.

471
00:40:54,801 --> 00:40:57,081
To them, it's a matter of, um, national priority...

472
00:40:57,081 --> 00:41:00,941
thatJews be made to shovel snow.

473
00:41:00,941 --> 00:41:05,531
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar. You know it and I know it.

474
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:11,121
Jews shoveling snow. It's got a, um, ritual significance.

475
00:41:13,711 --> 00:41:14,861
Come with me.

476
00:41:14,861 --> 00:41:17,251
I am an essential worker.

477
00:41:17,251 --> 00:41:18,681
Essential worker?

478
00:41:18,681 --> 00:41:19,901
Yes.

479
00:41:22,471 --> 00:41:24,551
I work for Oskar Schindler.

480
00:41:24,551 --> 00:41:25,621
Essential worker for Oskar Schindler.

481
00:41:25,621 --> 00:41:27,691
A one-armed Jew?

482
00:41:27,691 --> 00:41:29,731
Twice as useless! -Yes, yes.

483
00:41:30,051 --> 00:41:33,191
I lost a day of production, Rolf.

484
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:36,231
I work for Oskar Schindler.

485
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:40,451
Danka, look at the snow. Look at the snow. Look at the snow!

486
00:41:44,411 --> 00:41:47,761
I lost a worker. I expect to be compensated.

487
00:41:47,761 --> 00:41:50,861
File a grievance with the Economic Office. It's your right.

488
00:41:50,861 --> 00:41:52,201
Would it do any good?

489
00:41:52,201 --> 00:41:53,921
Of course not.

490
00:41:56,241 --> 00:42:00,651
A big shot from the SS Budget and Construction Office came to lunch...

491
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:04,401
and he told us that to believe theJewish skilled worker had a place...

492
00:42:04,401 --> 00:42:06,121
in Reich economics

493
00:42:06,121 --> 00:42:08,321
was a treasonable idea.

494
00:42:12,161 --> 00:42:15,341
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?

495
00:42:16,351 --> 00:42:18,661
He was a metal press operator.

496
00:42:22,991 --> 00:42:24,831
Quite skilled.

497
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:57,311
Herr Direktor?  Shit. I don't believe it.

498
00:42:57,311 --> 00:42:59,401
Stern, is that you?

499
00:42:59,601 --> 00:43:03,511
No, it's Poldek. It's about Stern.

500
00:43:04,241 --> 00:43:07,481
Leave your luggage on the platform.

501
00:43:07,481 --> 00:43:09,781
Clearly label it.

502
00:43:09,801 --> 00:43:13,341
Given name first, then your surname.

503
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:18,561
Do not bring your baggage with you. It will follow you later.

504
00:43:19,031 --> 00:43:22,621
Leave your luggage on the platform.

505
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,861
Clearly label it.

506
00:43:28,771 --> 00:43:30,211
Stern?

507
00:43:32,921 --> 00:43:34,341
He's on the list.

508
00:43:34,341 --> 00:43:35,691
He is?

509
00:43:35,841 --> 00:43:37,461
Well, let's find him.

510
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:39,981
I'm sorry. You can't have him.

511
00:43:39,981 --> 00:43:41,431
He's on the list. If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list.

512
00:43:41,431 --> 00:43:44,161
I'm talking to a clerk. What is your name?

513
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:46,301
Sir, the list is correct.

514
00:43:46,301 --> 00:43:48,851
I didn't ask you about the list. I asked you your name.

515
00:43:48,851 --> 00:43:50,271
Klaus Tauber.

516
00:43:53,341 --> 00:43:57,241
Hauptscharfuhrer, this gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.

517
00:43:57,241 --> 00:43:59,801
My plant manager is somewhere on this train.

518
00:43:59,801 --> 00:44:02,091
If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production...

519
00:44:02,091 --> 00:44:04,291
and the Armaments Board will want to know why.

520
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:06,631
Is he on the list?

521
00:44:06,631 --> 00:44:08,031
Yes, sir.

522
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,541
Itzhak Stern.

523
00:44:10,641 --> 00:44:15,591
Well, the list is correct, sir. There is nothing I can do.

524
00:44:16,331 --> 00:44:17,841
What is your name?

525
00:44:19,131 --> 00:44:24,881
My name? My name is Kunder. Kunder. Hauptscharfuhrer Kunder.

526
00:44:25,261 --> 00:44:26,311
-K-U-N-D-E-R. -And what's yours?

527
00:44:26,311 --> 00:44:28,881
Schindler. S-C-H-l-N-D-L-E-R.

528
00:44:28,881 --> 00:44:30,761
Gentlemen, thank you very much.

529
00:44:30,761 --> 00:44:32,711
I think I can guarantee you you'll both be in...

530
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:37,141
Southern Russia before the end of the month. Good day.

531
00:44:40,401 --> 00:44:41,841
Stern!

532
00:44:42,321 --> 00:44:46,201
Stern! -Stern! Itzhak Stern!

533
00:44:52,881 --> 00:44:55,121
Stern! Itzhak Stern! Stern.! Stern.! -Itzhak Stern.!

534
00:44:58,641 --> 00:44:59,981
Stern!

535
00:45:00,141 --> 00:45:01,661
Sir? Stern! Herr Direktor.

536
00:45:07,091 --> 00:45:08,831
My apologies.

537
00:45:09,201 --> 00:45:10,531
Stop the train! He's here! -I apologize.

538
00:45:10,531 --> 00:45:13,411
Stop the train! -Stop the train!

539
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:15,081
Stop it!

540
00:45:28,301 --> 00:45:31,071
Sign here. Initial there.

541
00:45:32,341 --> 00:45:34,981
Makes no difference to us, you understand. This one, that one.

542
00:45:35,011 --> 00:45:38,801
It's the inconvenience to the list.

543
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:40,111
It's the paperwork.

544
00:45:40,111 --> 00:45:42,841
I somehow left my work card at home.

545
00:45:42,841 --> 00:45:46,031
I tried to explain them it was a mistake, but...

546
00:45:46,461 --> 00:45:47,591
I'm sorry, it was stupid!

547
00:45:47,591 --> 00:45:49,891
What if I got here five minutes later?

548
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,291
Then where would I be?

549
00:47:35,121 --> 00:47:37,311
"JEWISH TOWN" KRAKOW GHETTO WINTER "42 Tzukeer end sacrean.

550
00:47:37,311 --> 00:47:39,631
"JEWISH TOWN" KRAKOW GHETTO WINTER "42

551
00:47:39,631 --> 00:47:42,241
I woke up from a dream this morning.

552
00:47:42,301 --> 00:47:46,641
I was broke and sharing a room with 12 people I didn't know...

553
00:47:46,641 --> 00:47:52,361
only to discover I was broke and sharing a room with 12 people I didn't know.

554
00:47:52,501 --> 00:47:53,681
You laugh about it?

555
00:47:53,681 --> 00:47:55,181
I have to laugh.

556
00:47:55,181 --> 00:47:57,541
You are living behind walls.

557
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,721
The walls I can deal with.

558
00:47:59,721 --> 00:48:02,191
It's the restrictions to my life I'm tired of.

559
00:48:02,191 --> 00:48:05,261
Those walls keep them out. That's all I care about.

560
00:48:05,261 --> 00:48:06,551
I like it here.

561
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:10,451
There's a kind of, I don't know ancestral squalor to it all.

562
00:48:10,451 --> 00:48:11,321
You are a slave to these people.

563
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:12,561
No one envies us anymore.

564
00:48:12,561 --> 00:48:13,511
I'm smart.

565
00:48:13,511 --> 00:48:15,711
Oh, yes, you're smart.

566
00:48:15,711 --> 00:48:17,431
You're a real genius. -You had your chance.

567
00:48:17,871 --> 00:48:21,721
Today, today I actually found time to organize a thought.

568
00:48:21,721 --> 00:48:24,261
I can't remember the last time I did that.

569
00:48:24,261 --> 00:48:28,501
When's the last time we stood around and talked?

570
00:48:28,501 --> 00:48:31,521
No one ordered me onto a truck today.

571
00:48:31,661 --> 00:48:33,961
No one took my business away from me.

572
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:36,111
You don't really have a business to take.

573
00:48:36,361 --> 00:48:40,641
There's nowhere down from here. This is it. This is the bottom.

574
00:48:40,641 --> 00:48:44,251
The ghetto is... liberty.

575
00:48:50,051 --> 00:48:53,171
This street divides the ghetto just about in half.

576
00:48:53,651 --> 00:48:56,021
Right side, Ghetto A: Civil employees...

577
00:48:56,581 --> 00:49:01,041
industrial workers and so on.

578
00:49:01,681 --> 00:49:03,851
Left side, Ghetto B

579
00:49:04,581 --> 00:49:06,471
Surplus labor...

580
00:49:06,471 --> 00:49:08,461
the elderly and infirm mostly.

581
00:49:08,461 --> 00:49:10,761
Which is where you'll want to start, huh?

582
00:49:11,301 --> 00:49:12,711
Do you have any questions, sir?

583
00:49:13,511 --> 00:49:16,761
Ja why is the top down? I'm fucking freezing.

584
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:21,321
We expect a labor force of 25  000 to 30  000.

585
00:49:21,631 --> 00:49:23,151
Segregated  of course. The men in the barracks near the quarry.

586
00:49:23,151 --> 00:49:24,801
The women on the other side of the wire.

587
00:49:24,801 --> 00:49:27,061
My place is where?

588
00:49:27,351 --> 00:49:28,821
There, sir.

589
00:49:28,821 --> 00:49:30,331
There?

590
00:49:30,331 --> 00:49:31,701
You call that a villa? -Yes, the villa.

591
00:49:31,701 --> 00:49:33,011
Their synagogue, can you see it?

592
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:33,901
That's not a villa.

593
00:49:33,901 --> 00:49:35,531
We're planning to turn it into the camp stables.

594
00:49:35,531 --> 00:49:37,061
It's a house.

595
00:49:37,401 --> 00:49:39,081
What's that over there?

596
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:43,631
Kindergarten. Fifty-one.

597
00:49:43,901 --> 00:49:48,121
And we have a dentist, shoemaker, practical physicians.

598
00:49:50,751 --> 00:49:52,701
There they are, sir.

599
00:49:57,671 --> 00:50:00,461
One of you is, uh, a very lucky girl.

600
00:50:01,481 --> 00:50:05,011
There is an opening for a job...

601
00:50:05,011 --> 00:50:10,881
away from all this... backbreaking work at my new villa.

602
00:50:15,781 --> 00:50:19,361
Uh, which of you has domestic experience?

603
00:50:22,621 --> 00:50:26,491
Ja, on second thought, I don't really want someone else's maid.

604
00:50:26,491 --> 00:50:29,501
All those annoying habits I have to undo.

605
00:50:34,261 --> 00:50:36,941
I don't want to give you my cold.

606
00:50:37,481 --> 00:50:38,941
Uh, what's your name?

607
00:50:39,641 --> 00:50:41,501
-Helen Hirsch. -What?

608
00:50:41,641 --> 00:50:43,431
Helen Hirsch.

609
00:50:43,431 --> 00:50:45,141
What? I can't hear.

610
00:50:45,551 --> 00:50:47,141
Helen Hirsch.

611
00:51:05,501 --> 00:51:07,421
To work.!

612
00:51:07,421 --> 00:51:09,711
Take it down.! It is not safe.!

613
00:51:11,611 --> 00:51:14,811
She says the foundation was poured wrong. She's got to take it down.

614
00:51:14,811 --> 00:51:16,731
I told her it's the barracks, not the fucking Hotel Europa.

615
00:51:16,731 --> 00:51:20,191
Fucking Jew bitch engineer.

616
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:21,831
You fucking bitch!

617
00:51:21,831 --> 00:51:28,741
Herr Kommandant. The entire foundation has to be torn down and repoured.

618
00:51:28,741 --> 00:51:31,521
If not,

619
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:34,441
there will be at least a subsidence at the southern end of the barracks.

620
00:51:34,441 --> 00:51:37,371
Subsidence, and then collapse.

621
00:51:37,371 --> 00:51:38,621
And you are an engineer?

622
00:51:38,621 --> 00:51:39,961
Yes.

623
00:51:40,071 --> 00:51:41,961
My name is Diana Reiter.

624
00:51:41,961 --> 00:51:45,211
I'm a graduate of Civil Engineering from the University of Milan.

625
00:51:45,211 --> 00:51:48,611
Ah, an educated Jew, like Karl Marx himself.

626
00:51:59,271 --> 00:52:01,181
Shoot her. -What?

627
00:52:03,771 --> 00:52:08,021
Herr Kommandant, I'm only trying to do my job.

628
00:52:08,021 --> 00:52:09,381
Ja, I'm doing mine.

629
00:52:09,381 --> 00:52:11,801
But, sir, she's foreman of construction.

630
00:52:11,801 --> 00:52:14,551
We are not going to have arguments with these people.

631
00:52:18,621 --> 00:52:20,791
No. Shoot her here, on my authority.

632
00:52:31,901 --> 00:52:33,811
It will take more than that.

633
00:52:33,811 --> 00:52:35,351
I'm sure you're right.

634
00:52:42,881 --> 00:52:47,541
Take it down, repour it, rebuild it. Like she said.

635
00:52:47,671 --> 00:52:51,111
We have more to see, but we have only one more hour of light.

636
00:53:02,161 --> 00:53:04,451
Today is history.

637
00:53:05,881 --> 00:53:08,841
Today will be remembered.

638
00:53:10,181 --> 00:53:11,921
Years from now

639
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:16,531
the young will ask with wonder about this day.

640
00:53:17,481 --> 00:53:20,651
Today is history, and you are part of it.

641
00:53:22,631 --> 00:53:24,951
Six hundred years ago...

642
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:28,701
When elsewhere they were footing the blame for the Black Death

643
00:53:28,701 --> 00:53:30,691
Kazimierz the Great, so-called...

644
00:53:30,781 --> 00:53:35,791
told the Jews they could come to Krakow.

645
00:53:36,531 --> 00:53:39,061
Chaja, bread. They came. Not that fat. No, less.

646
00:53:39,061 --> 00:53:41,841
They trundled their belongings into the city.

647
00:53:42,131 --> 00:53:46,081
Yes, a bit less. They settled.

648
00:53:46,401 --> 00:53:48,171
They took hold. They prospered...

649
00:53:48,741 --> 00:53:52,881
in business, science, education, the arts.

650
00:53:53,511 --> 00:53:56,061
They came here with nothing.

651
00:53:57,221 --> 00:53:58,681
Nothing.

652
00:53:59,521 --> 00:54:01,771
And they flourished.

653
00:54:02,341 --> 00:54:07,511
For six centuries there has been a Jewish Krakow.

654
00:54:08,381 --> 00:54:10,181
Think about that.

655
00:54:10,631 --> 00:54:12,311
By this evening...

656
00:54:12,701 --> 00:54:16,271
those six centuries are a rumor.

657
00:54:17,771 --> 00:54:20,001
They never happened.

658
00:54:20,981 --> 00:54:23,091
Today is history.

659
00:54:35,741 --> 00:54:39,951
MARCH 13, 1943

660
00:54:52,071 --> 00:54:56,281
I think we will start... with Ghetto B.

661
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:06,441
All right?

662
00:55:06,441 --> 00:55:07,421
Start from both sides?

663
00:55:07,421 --> 00:55:10,831
I would like you to start there. The right side?

664
00:55:10,831 --> 00:55:12,401
The right side, yeah. And then move around. -Okay.

665
00:56:52,411 --> 00:56:54,281
Gold, Chaim! Platz Chodi.

666
00:56:56,021 --> 00:56:57,611
Gold, Chaim!

667
00:56:57,611 --> 00:56:58,931
Yes, Chaim Gold.

668
00:56:58,931 --> 00:57:00,281
Shoot him.

669
00:57:20,031 --> 00:57:21,881
Hey, little boy. Wie alt bist du, he?

670
00:57:22,921 --> 00:57:27,051
Na, wie hiesst du ? Wie heisst du, huh ?

671
00:57:37,771 --> 00:57:40,331
Was soll der Koffer hier?

672
00:57:58,091 --> 00:57:59,861
We're getting out through the sewers.

673
00:57:59,861 --> 00:58:02,171
I have to check if they're clear.

674
00:58:02,171 --> 00:58:04,061
Mila, pack some things. Nothing bigger than this.

675
00:58:04,061 --> 00:58:05,581
I can't go in the sewers.

676
00:58:05,581 --> 00:58:09,091
I told you I won't go in the sewers.

677
00:58:11,251 --> 00:58:13,011
You can go.

678
00:58:13,011 --> 00:58:14,811
Yes, you can.

679
00:58:16,651 --> 00:58:18,831
I won't go in the sewers.

680
00:58:29,481 --> 00:58:32,591
Move! Over there! Over there! Move!

681
00:58:33,331 --> 00:58:35,301
Your card, Jew!

682
00:58:35,921 --> 00:58:38,291
Deine Papiere,Jude!

683
00:58:38,291 --> 00:58:41,291
Deine Papiere,Jude!

684
00:58:42,261 --> 00:58:45,161
That line.

685
00:59:11,251 --> 00:59:13,551
Was soll denn die Scheisse? Bist du denn verrueckt geworden?

686
00:59:13,551 --> 00:59:16,041
Mit diesem Scheissgewehr haettest du mich erschiessen koennen!

687
00:59:16,041 --> 00:59:18,101
Du hast so nah an mir vorbeigeschossen!

688
00:59:18,101 --> 00:59:20,491
Was heisst hier Entschuldigung. Du bist wohl verrueckt geworden!

689
00:59:20,491 --> 00:59:23,971
Zurueckbleiben! Zurueckbleiben!

690
00:59:27,721 --> 00:59:31,441
Nicht sprechen,nicht sprechen! Einfach zu den Lastwagen gehen!

691
00:59:31,441 --> 00:59:34,311
Weiterlaufen! Weiterlaufen! Nicht sprechen!

692
00:59:43,731 --> 00:59:45,551
Komm her, du Judensau!

693
00:59:45,551 --> 00:59:48,101
Bleib stehen, hab'ich gesagt. Bleib stehen!

694
01:00:42,731 --> 01:00:45,021
She's good as dead. Leave her.

695
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:48,691
Give me a moment. Just let me bring her inside.

696
01:00:53,871 --> 01:00:57,421
You can join her or join the line.

697
01:01:02,061 --> 01:01:03,941
Women to the left! Wilhelm! Rose!

698
01:01:04,191 --> 01:01:07,011
Men to right. Women to the left.

699
01:01:07,161 --> 01:01:08,086
-Women to the left.

700
01:01:08,087 --> 01:01:10,201
-Let me go! I won't leave my husband!

701
01:01:14,551 --> 01:01:16,431
Women to the left, and men to the right. Promise me, be safe.

702
01:01:20,081 --> 01:01:23,461
your government is in the wrong country!

703
01:02:16,541 --> 01:02:18,251
Mila!

704
01:02:43,371 --> 01:02:45,661
Oh, God, Danka!

705
01:02:51,041 --> 01:02:52,641
You have a Blauschein. -Blauschein doesn't matter anymore.

706
01:02:53,281 --> 01:02:56,011
-They are cleaning out the ghetto. -There's not enough room for you.

707
01:02:56,011 --> 01:02:59,891
What are you talking about? We tried it before. There's more than enough room.

708
01:02:59,891 --> 01:03:02,521
I changed my mind! Mama!

709
01:03:02,731 --> 01:03:07,361
Look at the space in there. Now look at me. You are just scared.

710
01:03:07,361 --> 01:03:09,441
I can fit the girl, but not you.

711
01:03:09,441 --> 01:03:10,831
Mama, I'm coming out!

712
01:03:10,831 --> 01:03:14,191
Stay where you are.  I'd rather you be here than who knows where.

713
01:03:14,191 --> 01:03:16,451
Mama!

714
01:03:35,621 --> 01:03:37,481
Herr Kommandant.!

715
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:39,221
Very good saluting.

716
01:03:39,221 --> 01:03:41,041
I respectfully report

717
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:43,161
I've been given orders to clear the bundles from the road...

718
01:03:43,161 --> 01:03:46,061
so there will be no obstructions to the thoroughfare.

719
01:03:46,271 --> 01:03:51,461
Finish and join the lines, little Polish clicking soldier.

720
01:04:13,001 --> 01:04:14,231
Mrs. Dresner?

721
01:04:14,231 --> 01:04:15,711
Yes.

722
01:04:16,101 --> 01:04:18,411
Oh, you are a friend of my son's.

723
01:04:18,411 --> 01:04:20,731
Don't worry, I'll go quietly. I'll be no trouble.

724
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:22,401
No, get under the stairs.

725
01:04:22,401 --> 01:04:25,041
They'll be done searching soon. You'll be safe there.

726
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:27,241
Please hide ! Please !

727
01:04:27,241 --> 01:04:30,531
Hide under the stairs.

728
01:04:33,811 --> 01:04:36,241
I've searched the building. There's no one here.

729
01:04:36,241 --> 01:04:39,011
Also, gehen wir zum nachsten Block. -Einverstanden.

730
01:04:45,831 --> 01:04:48,561
-Danka! Ah! -Mama!

731
01:04:53,471 --> 01:04:54,871
Hello, Adam.

732
01:04:56,251 --> 01:04:57,991
H-Hello, Danka.

733
01:05:03,491 --> 01:05:06,521
Come with me. I will put you in the good line.

734
01:05:09,021 --> 01:05:12,071
Do you know the saying, "An hour of life is still life"?

735
01:05:12,071 --> 01:05:14,001
You are not a boy anymore.

736
01:05:14,001 --> 01:05:16,191
I'm saying a blessing for you.

737
01:06:49,781 --> 01:06:52,381
Oh, please, let's go. Let's go, please.

738
01:06:53,531 --> 01:06:55,071
Come on.

739
01:09:27,881 --> 01:09:31,851
Was ist das? Ist das Bach? Nein, nein. Mozart.

740
01:09:31,851 --> 01:09:34,281
Mozart? Ja.

741
01:10:02,951 --> 01:10:05,521
I wish this fucking night were over.

742
01:11:02,471 --> 01:11:04,541
Namen verlesen! Wer aufgerufen wird

743
01:11:04,541 --> 01:11:06,701
hebt seine Hand und ein deutliches Jawhol!

744
01:11:06,701 --> 01:11:10,181
Jawohl.

745
01:11:10,181 --> 01:11:13,701
Jawohl.

746
01:11:13,701 --> 01:11:16,911
Keller, Fanni! Jawohl.

747
01:11:16,911 --> 01:11:21,261
Adalbert, Hermann! Jawohl.

748
01:11:21,261 --> 01:11:23,631
Faber, Dorothea! Jawohl.

749
01:11:23,631 --> 01:11:26,991
Goldstein, Pola! Jawohl.

750
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:29,831
Warmberger, Markus!

751
01:11:29,831 --> 01:11:31,781
Jawohl.

752
01:11:31,781 --> 01:11:34,661
Edelstein, Max!

753
01:11:55,951 --> 01:11:58,861
The worst is over. We are workers now.

754
01:12:29,231 --> 01:12:32,601
Keine Mudigkeit vorschutzen!

755
01:12:36,421 --> 01:12:38,201
Oh, God, Amon.

756
01:12:43,621 --> 01:12:48,761
Sofort in der Baracke zurUckmelden!

757
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:39,971
Amon, you're such a damned fuckin' child !

758
01:13:39,971 --> 01:13:41,671
Wakey, wakey.

759
01:13:51,451 --> 01:13:54,621
-Make coffee. -Make it yourself.

760
01:14:09,491 --> 01:14:11,881
The SS will manage...

761
01:14:11,881 --> 01:14:13,991
certain industries itself inside plaszow...

762
01:14:16,291 --> 01:14:19,841
another for reprocessing Jewish clothing...

763
01:14:19,841 --> 01:14:22,161
from the ghettos for use by bombed-out families back home.

764
01:14:22,161 --> 01:14:25,041
But it's private industry like yours that stands to benefit most...

765
01:14:25,041 --> 01:14:27,761
by moving inside the wire of Commandant Amon Goeth's camp...

766
01:14:27,761 --> 01:14:30,151
No, no, no. Sit, sit. Julian, how are you?

767
01:14:30,151 --> 01:14:31,701
-How are you? -Good to see you, my friend.

768
01:14:31,701 --> 01:14:32,791
Oskar Schindler.

769
01:14:32,791 --> 01:14:34,281
LeoJohn.

770
01:14:38,691 --> 01:14:39,691
Franz, good to see you.

771
01:14:39,691 --> 01:14:41,081
Hello, Oskar. Glad you could join us.

772
01:14:41,081 --> 01:14:43,461
My pleasure. Julius.

773
01:14:43,571 --> 01:14:44,461
How are you? You lost weight.

774
01:14:44,461 --> 01:14:45,451
Only in the shoulders.

775
01:14:45,451 --> 01:14:47,661
Please, everybody, sit down.

776
01:14:48,411 --> 01:14:50,751
How are you doing? Oskar Schindler.

777
01:14:52,731 --> 01:14:53,951
We started without you.

778
01:14:53,951 --> 01:14:56,331
Fine. I miss anything good?

779
01:14:56,601 --> 01:14:58,851
I was explaining to Herr Bosch and Herr Madritsch...

780
01:14:58,851 --> 01:15:01,941
some of the benefits of moving their factories into Plaszow.

781
01:15:01,941 --> 01:15:03,791
I meant the food.

782
01:15:06,431 --> 01:15:10,591
Since your labor is housed on-site, it's available to you at all times.

783
01:15:10,591 --> 01:15:12,731
You can work them all night if you want.

784
01:15:13,171 --> 01:15:16,131
Your factory policies, whatever they've been in the past

785
01:15:16,131 --> 01:15:19,521
they'll continue to be. They'll be respected.

786
01:15:19,731 --> 01:15:22,611
I have to know, where do you get a suit like that?

787
01:15:22,611 --> 01:15:23,601
What is that? Is that silk?

788
01:15:23,601 --> 01:15:25,141
Of course.

789
01:15:26,691 --> 01:15:29,861
Ja. It's... It has a nice sheen about it.

790
01:15:29,861 --> 01:15:30,661
Thank you.

791
01:15:30,661 --> 01:15:31,841
Very nice.

792
01:15:31,981 --> 01:15:36,261
I'd say I'd get you one, but the man who made it is probably dead.

793
01:15:36,261 --> 01:15:38,231
I don't know.

794
01:15:38,231 --> 01:15:40,671
I go to work the other day.

795
01:15:41,401 --> 01:15:43,341
Nobody's there.

796
01:15:43,611 --> 01:15:47,751
Nobody tells me about this. I have to find out. I have to go in.

797
01:15:48,261 --> 01:15:50,261
Everybody's gone.

798
01:15:58,141 --> 01:16:00,951
They're not gone. They're here.

799
01:16:04,311 --> 01:16:06,401
They're mine! Every day that goes by, I'm losing money.

800
01:16:06,401 --> 01:16:09,141
Every worker that is shot costs me money. I have to find somebody else.

801
01:16:09,141 --> 01:16:11,051
We are going to be making so much money...

802
01:16:11,051 --> 01:16:12,341
that none of this is going to matter.

803
01:16:12,341 --> 01:16:14,201
It's bad business.

804
01:16:26,411 --> 01:16:27,811
Thank you.

805
01:16:28,131 --> 01:16:30,041
Leave the bottle.

806
01:16:30,661 --> 01:16:33,181
Take that.

807
01:16:34,081 --> 01:16:37,111
Lena... thank you.

808
01:16:46,181 --> 01:16:49,331
Scherner told me something else about you.

809
01:16:51,391 --> 01:16:53,441
Yeah? What's that?

810
01:16:53,611 --> 01:16:57,761
That you know the meaning of the word "gratitude."

811
01:16:58,871 --> 01:17:00,841
That it's not some vague thing with you...

812
01:17:00,841 --> 01:17:04,341
like it is with others.

813
01:17:05,261 --> 01:17:08,021
You want to stay where you are.

814
01:17:08,411 --> 01:17:11,271
You've got things going on the side.

815
01:17:11,571 --> 01:17:15,431
Things are good.

816
01:17:15,431 --> 01:17:17,441
You don't want anybody telling you what to do.

817
01:17:17,671 --> 01:17:21,771
I can understand all that, you know. L... I know you.

818
01:17:24,141 --> 01:17:29,151
What you want... is your own sub-camp.

819
01:17:34,331 --> 01:17:36,641
Do you have any idea what is involved? The paperwork alone?

820
01:17:36,851 --> 01:17:39,101
You've got to build the thing.

821
01:17:39,101 --> 01:17:41,931
Getting the fucking permits is enough to drive you crazy.

822
01:17:41,931 --> 01:17:44,551
Then the engineers show up, they stand around

823
01:17:44,551 --> 01:17:47,481
they argue about drainage, foundations...

824
01:17:47,481 --> 01:17:49,201
codes, exact specifications, fences four kilometers long

825
01:17:49,201 --> 01:17:50,171
1,200 kilograms of barbed wire...

826
01:17:50,171 --> 01:17:53,571
6,000 kilograms of electrified fences, ceramic insulators...

827
01:17:53,571 --> 01:17:55,491
three cubic meters of air space per prisoner.

828
01:17:55,491 --> 01:17:57,511
I'm telling you, you want to shoot somebody.

829
01:17:57,511 --> 01:17:59,661
I've been through it. I know.

830
01:17:59,661 --> 01:18:02,161
Well, you know. You've been through it.

831
01:18:05,401 --> 01:18:07,991
You could make things easier for me.

832
01:18:11,201 --> 01:18:13,441
I'd be grateful.

833
01:18:46,921 --> 01:18:48,481
Where's Stern?

834
01:18:52,251 --> 01:18:54,441
Goldberg and Chilowicz... make sure I see my cut...

835
01:18:54,441 --> 01:18:59,671
from the, uh, factory owners in this camp...

836
01:18:59,671 --> 01:19:03,141
leaving you to take care of my main account...

837
01:19:03,141 --> 01:19:06,141
the Schindler account.

838
01:19:06,381 --> 01:19:10,231
He wants his independence. I gave it to him.

839
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:12,901
But independence costs money.

840
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:15,051
This you understand?

841
01:19:20,261 --> 01:19:21,921
Look at me.

842
01:19:32,481 --> 01:19:35,701
Don't forget who you are working for now.

843
01:19:45,251 --> 01:19:47,641
Jawohl.! -Make sure he stays. He's a slippery bastard.!

844
01:19:47,641 --> 01:19:48,911
Ja. Now, girls, everyone.

845
01:19:55,361 --> 01:19:57,191
-We need more wine. -More wine!

846
01:19:57,851 --> 01:20:00,741
Stand on my friend. Don't let him leave.

847
01:20:22,721 --> 01:20:24,861
Thank you, Herr Direktor.

848
01:20:30,321 --> 01:20:31,501
What are you doing?

849
01:20:31,501 --> 01:20:33,881
What? Scratching my head.

850
01:20:33,961 --> 01:20:35,551
Makes them think we have lice.

851
01:20:35,551 --> 01:20:37,741
Helps make them keep their distance.

852
01:20:38,341 --> 01:20:39,211
-Do you have lice? -Do you have your notebook?

853
01:20:39,211 --> 01:20:42,091
The calendar on my desk has the birthdays of

854
01:20:42,091 --> 01:20:44,471
our SS friends' wives and children.

855
01:20:44,471 --> 01:20:46,161
Don't forget to send something.

856
01:20:46,531 --> 01:20:48,291
Record payoffs to the Main Administration

857
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:50,061
and Economics Office, the Arm...

858
01:20:50,061 --> 01:20:51,251
Slowly, Stern, slowly.

859
01:20:51,251 --> 01:20:53,841
The Armaments Board, Governor General's Division...

860
01:20:53,841 --> 01:20:56,621
of the Interior and Chief of Police as "fees"

861
01:20:56,621 --> 01:20:58,851
and make them on the first of each month...

862
01:20:58,851 --> 01:21:01,571
as opposed to individual payoffs to our SS contacts.

863
01:21:01,571 --> 01:21:03,671
The list is in the lower drawer of my desk, which you...

864
01:21:03,671 --> 01:21:04,911
"First of month..."

865
01:21:06,441 --> 01:21:09,411
SS contacts: List, lower drawer of my desk, which you handle...

866
01:21:09,411 --> 01:21:13,451
as cash contributions to legitimate charities sent to each official's office.

867
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:16,131
Dealings with our black market contacts

868
01:21:16,131 --> 01:21:18,591
listed as suppliers in the legitimate ledger

869
01:21:18,591 --> 01:21:19,831
are more complicated. Forget it.

870
01:21:19,831 --> 01:21:21,091
What do you mean, forget it? You can't forget it!

871
01:21:21,091 --> 01:21:23,531
It gives me a headache!

872
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:31,571
I couldn't get you out of here.

873
01:21:31,571 --> 01:21:32,921
I'll be all right.

874
01:21:33,601 --> 01:21:36,541
Anyway, I'm here almost every week.

875
01:21:36,681 --> 01:21:40,981
I'll look in on you, see how you're doing.

876
01:21:44,971 --> 01:21:47,571
Here, put these in your pocket. Come on.

877
01:21:52,481 --> 01:21:54,561
Herr Direktor, don't let things fall apart.

878
01:21:54,561 --> 01:21:56,161
I've worked too hard.

879
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:08,801
Thanks for... Good luck.

880
01:22:29,681 --> 01:22:32,501
Achtung, Mutzen ab.!

881
01:22:41,741 --> 01:22:43,111
-Work! -An die Arbeit.!

882
01:22:57,791 --> 01:22:59,201
What are you making?

883
01:22:59,331 --> 01:23:01,151
Hinges, sir.

884
01:23:04,461 --> 01:23:07,981
Ja, I've got some workers coming in tomorrow. Where are they from again?

885
01:23:07,981 --> 01:23:09,761
Yugoslavia, Herr Kommandant.

886
01:23:09,911 --> 01:23:12,011
I've got to make room.

887
01:23:14,591 --> 01:23:17,061
-Make me a hinge. -Yes, sir.

888
01:23:48,561 --> 01:23:50,111
Keep going, you're doing well.

889
01:23:59,331 --> 01:24:01,631
Oh, that's very good.

890
01:24:02,211 --> 01:24:05,841
But I'm a bit confused, and perhaps you can help me.

891
01:24:05,841 --> 01:24:08,251
What I don't understand is that you've been working...

892
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:13,371
since I think, what, about 6:00 this morning?

893
01:24:14,321 --> 01:24:19,111
Yet such a small pile of hinges.

894
01:24:46,971 --> 01:24:47,941
Oh, Christ.

895
01:24:47,941 --> 01:24:49,541
May I try that, sir?

896
01:24:49,541 --> 01:24:51,791
Check the angle lever. Maybe it's bent.

897
01:24:52,401 --> 01:24:53,492
No, no. You wouldn't hear

898
01:24:53,493 --> 01:24:54,881
a click if it was the angle lever.

899
01:24:54,881 --> 01:24:57,361
Maybe it's the pin. Maybe the pin shaft is greasy.

900
01:24:57,361 --> 01:24:59,451
What did I just say? Here.

901
01:25:01,221 --> 01:25:04,541
Herr Kommandant...

902
01:25:04,621 --> 01:25:06,121
I beg to report

903
01:25:06,121 --> 01:25:10,271
that my heap ofhinges was so unsatisfactory...

904
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:14,631
because the machines were being recalibrated this morning.

905
01:25:15,691 --> 01:25:18,731
I w-was put on to shoveling coal.

906
01:25:41,281 --> 01:25:42,801
Strange, huh?

907
01:25:49,731 --> 01:25:51,351
Thank you, Muek.

908
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:56,831
Ah, Lisiek. Don't touch the leather, it's just been oiled.

909
01:25:58,011 --> 01:25:58,491
-Rottenfuhrer. -Oh, for me?

910
01:25:58,491 --> 01:26:01,751
Oh, thank you very much, Herr Direktor.

911
01:26:12,651 --> 01:26:15,331
So the man can turn out a hinge in less than a minute.

912
01:26:15,331 --> 01:26:16,901
Why the long story? Hmm?

913
01:26:45,291 --> 01:26:46,461
Thank you, sir.

914
01:26:46,461 --> 01:26:48,021
You're welcome.

915
01:26:51,171 --> 01:26:53,961
Nobody knows who stole the chicken, hmm?

916
01:26:54,861 --> 01:26:59,381
A man walks around with a chicken and nobody notices this.

917
01:26:59,571 --> 01:27:01,401
Save yourselves.

918
01:27:02,331 --> 01:27:04,501
Tell him about the chicken.

919
01:27:19,491 --> 01:27:21,491
Still nobody knows.

920
01:27:32,451 --> 01:27:36,301
It was you. You committed this crime.

921
01:27:36,301 --> 01:27:36,951
No, sir.

922
01:27:36,951 --> 01:27:38,551
But you know who, though.

923
01:27:38,551 --> 01:27:39,461
Yes.

924
01:27:39,461 --> 01:27:40,801
Who?

925
01:27:42,151 --> 01:27:43,671
Him!

926
01:27:47,621 --> 01:27:48,651
He's very gifted.

927
01:27:48,651 --> 01:27:49,671
Sure.

928
01:27:49,671 --> 01:27:51,071
Bring him over.

929
01:27:53,851 --> 01:27:55,371
Yes, Sir.

930
01:27:56,621 --> 01:27:58,061
Thank you.

931
01:28:03,261 --> 01:28:04,921
Thank you again, Herr Direktor.

932
01:28:04,921 --> 01:28:06,051
You're welcome again.

933
01:28:06,051 --> 01:28:08,671
It's an honor to work for such a great company.

934
01:28:08,671 --> 01:28:09,751
It's great to have you.

935
01:28:09,751 --> 01:28:13,231
I promise to learn everything about enamelware production.

936
01:28:13,231 --> 01:28:14,711
That's great.

937
01:28:25,781 --> 01:28:28,441
Hello? Miss Elsa Krause is here.

938
01:28:28,441 --> 01:28:30,141
I only need five minutes.

939
01:28:30,141 --> 01:28:32,191
She wants to speak to the Herr Direktor.

940
01:28:57,531 --> 01:28:59,421
Yes. He won't see you.

941
01:29:28,731 --> 01:29:30,541
Please, sit down.

942
01:29:34,011 --> 01:29:35,621
Pernod? Cognac?

943
01:29:35,621 --> 01:29:37,541
Uh, no. No, thank you.

944
01:29:37,951 --> 01:29:40,821
So, what can I do for you?

945
01:29:45,591 --> 01:29:47,921
They say that no one dies here.

946
01:29:47,921 --> 01:29:50,591
They say your factory is a haven.

947
01:29:52,921 --> 01:29:54,911
They say you are good.

948
01:29:57,791 --> 01:29:59,491
Who says that?

949
01:30:00,051 --> 01:30:01,811
Everyone.

950
01:30:08,281 --> 01:30:10,921
My name is Regina Perlman, not Elsa Krause.

951
01:30:10,921 --> 01:30:12,841
I've been living in Krakow on false papers

952
01:30:12,841 --> 01:30:14,241
since the ghetto massacre.

953
01:30:14,241 --> 01:30:16,301
My parents are in Plaszow.

954
01:30:16,301 --> 01:30:20,361
Their names are Chana and Jakob Perlman.

955
01:30:20,361 --> 01:30:21,901
They are older people.

956
01:30:21,901 --> 01:30:23,991
They are killing older people now in plaszow.

957
01:30:23,991 --> 01:30:26,741
They bury them up in the forest. Look...

958
01:30:28,581 --> 01:30:30,591
I don't have any money.

959
01:30:30,631 --> 01:30:34,401
I, I borrowed these clothes.

960
01:30:36,321 --> 01:30:38,081
I'm begging you.

961
01:30:38,331 --> 01:30:41,931
Please, please bring them here.

962
01:30:41,931 --> 01:30:43,841
I don't do that.

963
01:30:44,551 --> 01:30:46,301
You've been misled.

964
01:30:46,931 --> 01:30:50,301
I ask one thing: Whether or not a worker has certain skills.

965
01:30:51,641 --> 01:30:53,861
My father is an importer, not a metalworker.

966
01:30:53,861 --> 01:30:55,991
Such activities are illegal.

967
01:30:55,991 --> 01:30:58,311
You will not entrap me!

968
01:30:58,811 --> 01:31:02,361
Cry, and I will have you arrested. I swear to God!

969
01:31:11,521 --> 01:31:13,991
People die. It's a fact of life.

970
01:31:14,261 --> 01:31:16,221
He wants to kill everybody?

971
01:31:16,221 --> 01:31:17,851
Great! What am I supposed to do about it?

972
01:31:17,961 --> 01:31:20,601
Bring everybody over? Is that what you think?

973
01:31:20,601 --> 01:31:23,461
Send them over to Schindler. Send them all!

974
01:31:23,461 --> 01:31:27,261
His place is a haven, didn't you know? It's not a factory.

975
01:31:27,261 --> 01:31:29,391
It's not an enterprise of any kind.

976
01:31:29,391 --> 01:31:32,221
It's a haven for rabbis and orphans...

977
01:31:32,221 --> 01:31:35,061
and people with no skills whatsoever!

978
01:31:37,601 --> 01:31:39,941
You think I don't know what you're doing?

979
01:31:39,941 --> 01:31:43,271
You're so quiet all the time. I know, I know!

980
01:31:43,271 --> 01:31:44,021
Are you losing money?

981
01:31:44,021 --> 01:31:46,351
That's not the point!

982
01:31:46,351 --> 01:31:47,451
What other point is...

983
01:31:47,451 --> 01:31:49,921
It's dangerous! It's dangerous to me!

984
01:31:53,791 --> 01:31:57,221
You have to understand. Goeth is under enormous pressure.

985
01:31:57,221 --> 01:32:00,001
You have to think of it in his situation.

986
01:32:01,101 --> 01:32:03,421
He's got this whole place to run.

987
01:32:03,421 --> 01:32:08,221
He's responsible for everything here, all these people.

988
01:32:09,571 --> 01:32:11,771
He's got a lot of things to worry about.

989
01:32:11,771 --> 01:32:15,271
And he's got the war which brings out the worst in people.

990
01:32:15,271 --> 01:32:17,181
Never the good, always the bad. Always the bad.

991
01:32:18,651 --> 01:32:23,131
But in normal circumstances he wouldn't be like this.

992
01:32:23,131 --> 01:32:23,971
He'd be all right.

993
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:26,451
There'd just be the good aspects of him which...

994
01:32:27,491 --> 01:32:30,101
He's a wonderful crook.

995
01:32:30,101 --> 01:32:34,461
A man who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...

996
01:32:34,461 --> 01:32:36,181
Killing.

997
01:32:36,951 --> 01:32:39,021
He can't enjoy it.

998
01:32:39,561 --> 01:32:41,701
Bejski told me the other day,

999
01:32:41,701 --> 01:32:45,881
somebody escaped from a work detail outside the wire.

1000
01:32:45,931 --> 01:32:49,151
Goeth lined up everybody from the missing man's barracks.

1001
01:32:49,211 --> 01:32:51,171
He shot the man to the left of Bejski, the man to the right ofhim.

1002
01:32:51,171 --> 01:32:56,001
He walked down the line shooting every other man with a pistol.

1003
01:33:01,961 --> 01:33:03,611
Twenty-five.

1004
01:33:07,901 --> 01:33:09,341
What do you want me to do about it?

1005
01:33:09,341 --> 01:33:10,931
Nothing, nothing.

1006
01:33:11,541 --> 01:33:13,481
We're just talking.

1007
01:33:25,371 --> 01:33:26,721
"Perlman."

1008
01:33:28,531 --> 01:33:30,511
Perlman!

1009
01:33:31,441 --> 01:33:33,081
Husband and wife.

1010
01:33:33,101 --> 01:33:36,941
Jakob and Chana Perlman!

1011
01:33:49,271 --> 01:33:51,611
Have Goldberg bring them over.

1012
01:34:45,081 --> 01:34:48,571
I'm sure this will be better than those rags, Lisiek.

1013
01:34:49,271 --> 01:34:52,971
Herr Direktor, I was just helping Lisiek to find something...

1014
01:34:52,971 --> 01:34:56,411
to clean the stains from the Herr Kommandant's bathtub.

1015
01:34:56,411 --> 01:34:58,641
Go clean it. Pardon me, Herr Direktor.

1016
01:35:02,391 --> 01:35:04,771
You don't have to report to me, Helen.

1017
01:35:05,511 --> 01:35:07,431
You know who I am? Hmm?

1018
01:35:15,901 --> 01:35:17,811
I'm Schindler.

1019
01:35:19,261 --> 01:35:22,141
Of course. L-I have heard and...

1020
01:35:22,941 --> 01:35:25,101
you have been here before.

1021
01:35:27,751 --> 01:35:30,301
Here, why don't you keep this someplace?

1022
01:35:30,301 --> 01:35:32,261
Go on, take it.

1023
01:35:32,341 --> 01:35:33,621
I get extra food here.

1024
01:35:33,621 --> 01:35:36,161
Well, if you don't want to eat it, trade it.

1025
01:35:36,921 --> 01:35:38,851
Or give it to Lisiek.

1026
01:35:40,771 --> 01:35:43,061
Why not build yourself up?

1027
01:35:47,491 --> 01:35:49,891
My first day here, he beat me...

1028
01:35:50,751 --> 01:35:54,581
because I threw out the bones from dinner.

1029
01:35:58,051 --> 01:36:02,231
He came down to the basement at midnight, and he...

1030
01:36:02,401 --> 01:36:04,991
he asked me where they were.

1031
01:36:07,491 --> 01:36:11,791
For his dogs, you understand.

1032
01:36:14,051 --> 01:36:16,521
I said to him, l... I don't know how I say this.

1033
01:36:16,631 --> 01:36:21,581
I never could say it now... I said to him...

1034
01:36:21,581 --> 01:36:24,531
"Why are you beating me?"

1035
01:36:27,261 --> 01:36:30,081
He said, "The reason I beat you now...

1036
01:36:30,891 --> 01:36:34,491
is because you ask why I beat you."

1037
01:36:36,011 --> 01:36:38,781
I know your sufferings, Helen.

1038
01:36:41,261 --> 01:36:43,301
It doesn't matter.

1039
01:36:45,281 --> 01:36:47,821
I have accepted them.

1040
01:36:48,391 --> 01:36:50,261
Accepted them?

1041
01:36:52,221 --> 01:36:54,091
One day he will shoot me.

1042
01:36:54,091 --> 01:36:56,611
No, no, no, no, he won't shoot you.

1043
01:36:56,611 --> 01:36:59,951
I know. I see things.

1044
01:37:00,471 --> 01:37:02,551
We were on the roof on Monday, young Lisiek and I...

1045
01:37:02,551 --> 01:37:07,921
and we saw the Herr Kommandant come out of the front door...

1046
01:37:07,921 --> 01:37:12,601
and down the steps by the patio right there below us and...

1047
01:37:12,601 --> 01:37:16,881
and there on the steps he drew his gun and he...

1048
01:37:17,121 --> 01:37:20,071
shot a woman who was passing by.

1049
01:37:21,281 --> 01:37:23,731
A woman carrying a bundle. Through the throat.

1050
01:37:23,731 --> 01:37:27,671
Just... Just a woman on her way somewhere, you know.

1051
01:37:27,671 --> 01:37:30,171
She was no fatter or thinner...

1052
01:37:30,331 --> 01:37:33,661
or slower or faster than anyone else...

1053
01:37:33,661 --> 01:37:36,601
and I couldn't guess what had she done.

1054
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:38,471
The more you see of the Herr Kommandant...

1055
01:37:42,541 --> 01:37:48,531
the more you see there is no set rules that you can live by.

1056
01:37:48,791 --> 01:37:51,181
You can't say to yourself, "If I follow these rules, I will be safe."

1057
01:37:51,181 --> 01:37:56,081
He won't shoot you because he enjoys you too much.

1058
01:37:59,101 --> 01:38:03,091
He enjoys you so much he won't even let you wear the star.

1059
01:38:03,681 --> 01:38:07,341
He doesn't want anyone else to know...

1060
01:38:07,451 --> 01:38:12,031
it's a Jew he's enjoying.

1061
01:38:15,231 --> 01:38:18,221
He shot the woman from the steps...

1062
01:38:18,221 --> 01:38:21,611
because she meant nothing to him.

1063
01:38:22,401 --> 01:38:26,931
She was one of a series neither offending or pleasing him.

1064
01:38:30,501 --> 01:38:32,721
But you, Helen.

1065
01:38:37,151 --> 01:38:41,251
It's all right. It's not that kind of a kiss.

1066
01:38:46,931 --> 01:38:48,761
Thank you.

1067
01:39:00,721 --> 01:39:03,001
Right. The wine.

1068
01:39:09,671 --> 01:39:12,681
Wonderful party, Amon. Thank you.

1069
01:39:20,891 --> 01:39:23,801
Why do you drink that motor oil?

1070
01:39:24,211 --> 01:39:26,671
Hmm? I send you good stuff all the time.

1071
01:39:27,001 --> 01:39:30,721
Your liver's going to explode like a hand grenade.

1072
01:39:30,831 --> 01:39:32,711
You know, I look at you...

1073
01:39:33,581 --> 01:39:35,281
I watch you.

1074
01:39:38,361 --> 01:39:40,171
You're never drunk.

1075
01:39:40,521 --> 01:39:45,241
Oh, that's...  that's real control.

1076
01:39:46,241 --> 01:39:48,421
Control is power.

1077
01:39:49,431 --> 01:39:51,611
That's power.

1078
01:39:55,311 --> 01:39:58,281
Is that why they fear us?

1079
01:40:00,211 --> 01:40:03,641
We have the fucking power to kill, that's why they fear us.

1080
01:40:03,991 --> 01:40:07,521
They fear us because we have the power to kill arbitrarily.

1081
01:40:07,651 --> 01:40:09,951
A man commits a crime, he should know better.

1082
01:40:09,951 --> 01:40:12,401
We have him killed, and feel good about it.

1083
01:40:12,441 --> 01:40:15,521
Or we kill him ourselves and we feel even better.

1084
01:40:17,251 --> 01:40:19,921
That's not power, though.

1085
01:40:20,381 --> 01:40:24,081
That's justice. It's different than power.

1086
01:40:27,161 --> 01:40:31,951
Power is when we have every justification to kill...

1087
01:40:32,471 --> 01:40:34,351
and we don't.

1088
01:40:34,931 --> 01:40:36,911
You think that's power?

1089
01:40:39,411 --> 01:40:41,381
That's what the emperors had. A man stole something...

1090
01:40:41,381 --> 01:40:44,121
he's brought in before the emperor...

1091
01:40:44,121 --> 01:40:48,251
he throws himself down on the ground, he begs for mercy.

1092
01:40:48,251 --> 01:40:50,921
He knows he's going to die.

1093
01:40:53,331 --> 01:40:57,101
And the emperor... pardons him.

1094
01:40:57,921 --> 01:41:00,961
This worthless man. He lets him go.

1095
01:41:04,501 --> 01:41:06,571
I think you are drunk.

1096
01:41:08,101 --> 01:41:10,571
That's power, Amon.

1097
01:41:11,161 --> 01:41:14,401
That... is power.

1098
01:41:21,701 --> 01:41:24,881
Amon the Good.

1099
01:41:27,111 --> 01:41:28,751
I pardon you.

1100
01:41:37,261 --> 01:41:38,321
What do they want?

1101
01:41:38,321 --> 01:41:41,621
I don't know, but they're in my office now reviewing our books.

1102
01:41:41,621 --> 01:41:43,511
As my accountant, tell me, should I be alarmed...

1103
01:41:43,841 --> 01:41:47,431
-that the auditors are reviewing my books? -Well...

1104
01:41:47,431 --> 01:41:49,041
-Or have you done your job properly? -You needn't be alarmed.

1105
01:41:49,041 --> 01:41:50,731
I needn't be alarmed.

1106
01:41:56,461 --> 01:41:57,381
I'm sorry, sir.

1107
01:41:57,381 --> 01:42:01,871
Do you know how much this saddle is worth? Do you know how much it costs?

1108
01:42:06,591 --> 01:42:08,021
All right.

1109
01:42:10,111 --> 01:42:11,471
All right.

1110
01:42:15,271 --> 01:42:18,161
Stern, what the hell are you doing following me around?

1111
01:43:03,861 --> 01:43:05,751
She was smoking on the job.

1112
01:43:09,021 --> 01:43:11,141
Tell her not to do it again.

1113
01:43:26,361 --> 01:43:28,461
I have to report, sir...

1114
01:43:29,911 --> 01:43:33,301
I've been unable to remove the stains from your bathtub.

1115
01:43:37,141 --> 01:43:38,871
-What are you using, Lisiek?

1116
01:43:38,871 --> 01:43:40,551
-Soap, Commandant.

1117
01:43:42,971 --> 01:43:45,501
Soap? Not lye?

1118
01:43:54,321 --> 01:43:57,581
Go ahead, go on, leave. Leave, I pardon you.

1119
01:44:19,021 --> 01:44:21,051
I pardon you.

1120
01:46:08,561 --> 01:46:11,941
Although I am not a rabbi, in these circumstances...

1121
01:46:11,941 --> 01:46:14,761
I pray to the Almighty that he will forgive me...

1122
01:46:14,761 --> 01:46:17,981
if I intone the blessings.

1123
01:47:11,381 --> 01:47:14,241
So this is where you come to hide from me.

1124
01:47:14,891 --> 01:47:17,011
I came to tell you...

1125
01:47:18,301 --> 01:47:24,501
that you, um, you really are a wonderful cook...

1126
01:47:24,691 --> 01:47:26,571
and a well-trained servant.

1127
01:47:26,691 --> 01:47:30,341
I mean it. If you need a reference after the war...

1128
01:47:31,611 --> 01:47:33,461
I'd be... I'd be happy to give you one.

1129
01:47:34,681 --> 01:47:36,801
It must get lonely down here...

1130
01:47:36,801 --> 01:47:40,591
when you're listening to everyone upstairs having such a good time.

1131
01:47:47,161 --> 01:47:48,531
Does it?

1132
01:47:51,251 --> 01:47:53,051
You can answer.

1133
01:47:55,331 --> 01:47:59,211
But what's the right answer? That's what you're thinking.

1134
01:47:59,611 --> 01:48:01,741
What does he want to hear?

1135
01:48:07,561 --> 01:48:11,561
The truth, Helen, is always the right answer.

1136
01:48:14,171 --> 01:48:16,091
Y-Yes, you're right.

1137
01:48:16,511 --> 01:48:18,581
Sometimes we're both lonely.

1138
01:48:20,111 --> 01:48:22,311
Yes. L...

1139
01:48:23,981 --> 01:48:25,561
I mean...

1140
01:48:32,871 --> 01:48:35,121
I would like so much to...

1141
01:48:36,411 --> 01:48:40,451
reach out and touch you in your loneliness.

1142
01:48:40,801 --> 01:48:44,061
Wh-What would that be like, I wonder? I mean...

1143
01:48:44,931 --> 01:48:47,011
What would be wrong with that?

1144
01:48:47,801 --> 01:48:49,951
I realize that you're not a-a person in the...

1145
01:48:50,071 --> 01:48:53,741
the strictest sense of the word, but...

1146
01:48:56,061 --> 01:48:59,081
No, maybe you're right about that too, you know.

1147
01:48:59,081 --> 01:49:04,001
Maybe what's... what's wrong isn't...  It's not us.

1148
01:49:04,891 --> 01:49:06,941
It's no... It's this.

1149
01:49:09,701 --> 01:49:12,661
I mean, when they compare you to...

1150
01:49:13,431 --> 01:49:16,951
to, uh, vermin and to rodents and to lice...

1151
01:49:20,161 --> 01:49:21,941
I just, uh...

1152
01:49:25,181 --> 01:49:29,941
N-No, you-you make a good point.  You make a very good point.

1153
01:49:38,431 --> 01:49:40,921
Is this the face of a rat?

1154
01:49:43,551 --> 01:49:46,731
Are these the eyes of a rat?

1155
01:49:49,081 --> 01:49:51,271
Hath not a Jew eyes?

1156
01:50:06,531 --> 01:50:10,371
I feel for you, Helen.

1157
01:50:26,541 --> 01:50:28,581
No, I don't think so.

1158
01:50:30,751 --> 01:50:33,641
You're a Jewish bitch.

1159
01:50:34,941 --> 01:50:37,101
You nearly talked me into it

1160
01:50:37,811 --> 01:50:39,501
didn't you?

1161
01:50:44,121 --> 01:50:45,741
Bravo.

1162
01:51:19,591 --> 01:51:21,681
On behalf of the... of the workers, sir...

1163
01:51:21,681 --> 01:51:25,401
I, I wish for you a happy birthday.

1164
01:51:25,401 --> 01:51:27,321
Happy birthday.

1165
01:51:27,321 --> 01:51:31,541
Well, the staff, please. Thank you very much for the lovely cake.

1166
01:51:50,361 --> 01:51:54,331
Thank you very much. Tell them thank you from me.

1167
01:52:09,431 --> 01:52:13,791
The trains arrived and the people were driven out with clubs.

1168
01:52:13,861 --> 01:52:17,821
They were lined up in front of two big warehouses.

1169
01:52:17,821 --> 01:52:21,561
One was marked "Cloak Room," and the other "Valuables."

1170
01:52:21,561 --> 01:52:24,241
And there they were made to undress.

1171
01:52:24,241 --> 01:52:29,001
AJewish boy handed them pieces of string to tie their shoes together.

1172
01:52:29,091 --> 01:52:31,041
They shaved their hair.

1173
01:52:31,351 --> 01:52:35,541
They told them it was needed to make something special for U-boat crews.

1174
01:52:36,481 --> 01:52:40,191
And then they were herded down a big corridor...

1175
01:52:40,191 --> 01:52:44,211
to bunkers with Stars of David on the doors...

1176
01:52:44,211 --> 01:52:47,441
and signs that said "Bath and Inhalation Room."

1177
01:52:48,161 --> 01:52:50,071
SS gave them soap.

1178
01:52:50,071 --> 01:52:54,091
They told them to breathe all the time because it's good for disinfecting.

1179
01:52:55,921 --> 01:52:58,081
And then they gassed them.

1180
01:52:59,201 --> 01:53:02,111
Mila, why soaps?

1181
01:53:02,351 --> 01:53:04,251
So that they would agree to go in, I think.

1182
01:53:04,251 --> 01:53:07,871
Come on, Mila, stop it. Your bedtime stories are scaring everyone.

1183
01:53:07,871 --> 01:53:12,291
-I just don't believe it. -Ja. You know it's ridiculous.

1184
01:53:12,291 --> 01:53:13,921
I don't believe it either. I cannot believe it.

1185
01:53:13,921 --> 01:53:14,851
I didn't say I believed it. I said I heard it.

1186
01:53:14,851 --> 01:53:15,901
From who?

1187
01:53:15,901 --> 01:53:18,591
From somebody who heard it from someone who was there.

1188
01:53:18,591 --> 01:53:23,121
You know, if they were there they would have been gassed.

1189
01:53:23,121 --> 01:53:24,471
-Yes. -It doesn't make any sense.

1190
01:53:24,471 --> 01:53:28,441
We're their workforce.

1191
01:53:28,441 --> 01:53:32,121
What sense does it make to kill your own workforce?

1192
01:53:32,121 --> 01:53:37,091
To go to all this trouble of assembling a workforce only to...

1193
01:53:37,091 --> 01:53:39,071
No, it can't be true.

1194
01:53:40,231 --> 01:53:43,381
We are very, very important for them.

1195
01:53:44,861 --> 01:53:46,341
-Good night.

1196
01:53:46,351 --> 01:53:47,721
-Good night. Sweet dreams.

1197
01:53:57,851 --> 01:54:00,161
Attention, attention.

1198
01:54:00,311 --> 01:54:05,301
Everyone who is alive is to come to the Appellplatz.

1199
01:54:06,301 --> 01:54:08,221
Attention, attention.

1200
01:54:08,221 --> 01:54:10,381
We have to go to the Appellplatz.

1201
01:54:10,381 --> 01:54:12,151
The list makers are here.

1202
01:54:12,151 --> 01:54:14,361
There is going to be a selection.

1203
01:54:14,591 --> 01:54:16,661
Attention, attention.

1204
01:54:17,151 --> 01:54:19,351
Everyone who is alive...

1205
01:54:19,351 --> 01:54:22,021
is to come to the Appellplatz.

1206
01:54:50,421 --> 01:54:52,831
You could afford to lose some weight, Amon.

1207
01:54:54,291 --> 01:54:56,601
And you've got to cut down on the cognac.

1208
01:54:56,601 --> 01:54:59,751
Morning. What's going on?

1209
01:54:59,841 --> 01:55:02,741
It's another semi-annual physical.

1210
01:55:04,191 --> 01:55:05,241
There.

1211
01:55:05,241 --> 01:55:10,541
Oh, I've, um, got another shipment coming in of, uh, What are they this time?

1212
01:55:11,251 --> 01:55:12,921
-Hungarians. -Oh, ja, Hungarians.

1213
01:55:12,921 --> 01:55:16,951
We've got to separate the sick from the healthy to make room.

1214
01:56:10,431 --> 01:56:12,141
Let me help you.

1215
01:56:12,861 --> 01:56:14,931
Look alive, Rebeka.

1216
01:56:36,601 --> 01:56:38,471
That's my mechanic.

1217
01:56:39,011 --> 01:56:41,661
Whose bright idea was it to get rid of him?

1218
01:57:42,781 --> 01:57:46,091
No, no, no. Wait, go away. She can work.

1219
01:57:46,091 --> 01:57:49,301
Come here. Look, separate the sick from the healthy.

1220
01:57:49,301 --> 01:57:51,881
Those who can work and those who can't. She can work.

1221
01:57:51,881 --> 01:57:53,861
You can work, you can come.

1222
01:59:17,471 --> 01:59:20,701
Those not selected for transport

1223
01:59:21,021 --> 01:59:22,521
put your clothes back on.

1224
01:59:22,521 --> 01:59:24,251
-Go back to the barracks.

1225
01:59:24,781 --> 01:59:26,931
-Return to the barracks.

1226
01:59:32,911 --> 01:59:34,821
Go back to the barracks.

1227
01:59:38,651 --> 01:59:40,181
Oh, my God!

1228
02:00:02,261 --> 02:00:04,171
-Olek? Olek? -Danka?

1229
02:00:21,641 --> 02:00:23,311
-Olek? -Danka?

1230
02:00:23,531 --> 02:00:24,411
-Danka?

1231
02:00:24,411 --> 02:00:25,671
-Olek?

1232
02:00:28,671 --> 02:00:29,941
-I didn't see him!

1233
02:00:29,941 --> 02:00:33,231
-They're hiding. I'm telling you, they're hiding.

1234
02:00:33,231 --> 02:00:38,351
I know Danka. She knows a good place. She took all of them together.

1235
02:00:57,141 --> 02:00:58,901
Find your own hiding place.

1236
02:00:58,901 --> 02:01:02,391
There's no room for you here. Go away, quick!

1237
02:01:24,911 --> 02:01:28,221
Get out. This is our place. Get out!

1238
02:01:51,651 --> 02:01:54,611
Oskar! -Amon. Gentlemen.  Why didn't you call me?

1239
02:01:54,611 --> 02:01:56,841
I tried to call you. Here, Hujar, move.

1240
02:01:56,841 --> 02:01:58,401
-Quite a picnic, huh? Madritsch. -Oskar.

1241
02:01:58,401 --> 02:02:02,201
They're running a little late. It's taking longer than I thought.

1242
02:02:02,721 --> 02:02:04,041
-A drink? -Something cold. Bowle.

1243
02:02:04,041 --> 02:02:06,171
The Bowle.

1244
02:02:09,561 --> 02:02:12,271
Oh, another beautiful day.

1245
02:02:50,861 --> 02:02:55,121
What do you say we get your fire hoses out here and hose down the cars?

1246
02:02:58,901 --> 02:03:00,531
Indulge me.

1247
02:03:02,221 --> 02:03:02,961
-Hujar.

1248
02:03:02,961 --> 02:03:04,011
-Yes, sir.

1249
02:03:04,321 --> 02:03:06,271
-Go bring the fire hoses.

1250
02:03:06,381 --> 02:03:07,881
-Where's the fire?

1251
02:03:11,011 --> 02:03:14,521
In the windows. That's it, that's it.

1252
02:03:14,551 --> 02:03:15,921
On the roof. That's it, good, good.

1253
02:03:18,561 --> 02:03:19,651
In the window, in the window.

1254
02:03:19,651 --> 02:03:20,931
Come on. Come on.

1255
02:03:24,741 --> 02:03:26,561
That's it, more, more.

1256
02:03:31,601 --> 02:03:33,251
That's it, that's it. More, more.

1257
02:03:34,941 --> 02:03:38,491
This is really cruel, Oskar. You are giving them hope.

1258
02:03:38,491 --> 02:03:40,281
You shouldn't do that. That's cruel.!

1259
02:03:40,961 --> 02:03:42,301
Come on, try and reach the far end. Look out...

1260
02:03:42,301 --> 02:03:45,531
Water.! More water.!

1261
02:03:51,981 --> 02:03:54,191
I've got some 200-meter hoses back in Emalia.

1262
02:03:54,191 --> 02:03:56,211
I have 20 meters at home in my garden.

1263
02:03:56,211 --> 02:03:58,101
We can reach the cars at the end.

1264
02:03:58,101 --> 02:04:01,111
What? What?

1265
02:04:05,661 --> 02:04:07,501
-Hujar. -Yeah, sure.

1266
02:04:25,771 --> 02:04:29,371
Don't forget the roof.  On the roof on the other side.

1267
02:04:36,931 --> 02:04:40,061
Water!  Scharfuhrer, every time the train stops...

1268
02:04:40,061 --> 02:04:42,671
you open the doors, you give them water, ja?

1269
02:04:42,691 --> 02:04:44,921
-Jawohl. -Ja. This car! This car!

1270
02:05:08,181 --> 02:05:11,031
I'm not saying you'll regret it, but you might.

1271
02:05:11,371 --> 02:05:13,091
-You should be aware of that.

1272
02:05:13,091 --> 02:05:15,571
-We will have to risk regret.

1273
02:05:16,021 --> 02:05:19,671
All right, sure. It's a nice day. I'll go for a drive with you.

1274
02:05:54,241 --> 02:05:56,021
What about you?

1275
02:05:56,131 --> 02:05:59,031
I violated the Race and Resettlement Act.

1276
02:05:59,671 --> 02:06:03,101
Though I doubt anyone can point out the actual provision to me.

1277
02:06:03,751 --> 02:06:06,231
I kissed a Jewish girl.

1278
02:06:11,091 --> 02:06:13,251
Did your prick fall off?

1279
02:06:31,141 --> 02:06:33,191
He likes women.

1280
02:06:35,281 --> 02:06:38,301
He likes good-looking women.

1281
02:06:39,651 --> 02:06:43,431
He sees a beautiful woman, he doesn't think.

1282
02:06:46,121 --> 02:06:50,751
he has so many women.  And they love him.

1283
02:06:51,221 --> 02:06:54,721
Ja, they love him. I mean, he is married, ja, but he's...

1284
02:06:55,751 --> 02:07:00,131
All right, no. She was Jewish. He shouldn't have done it.

1285
02:07:00,381 --> 02:07:02,781
But you didn't see this girl.

1286
02:07:02,871 --> 02:07:06,271
I saw this girl. This girl was, woof...

1287
02:07:06,901 --> 02:07:08,921
She was very good-looking.

1288
02:07:12,601 --> 02:07:14,941
They cast a spell on you, you know, theJews.

1289
02:07:14,941 --> 02:07:19,001
When you work closely with them, like I do, you see this.

1290
02:07:19,001 --> 02:07:21,181
They have this power. It's like a virus.

1291
02:07:21,181 --> 02:07:23,041
Some of my men are infected with this virus.

1292
02:07:23,041 --> 02:07:24,961
They should be pitied, not punished. They should receive treatment.

1293
02:07:24,961 --> 02:07:26,141
This is as real as typhus. I see this all the time.

1294
02:07:26,141 --> 02:07:28,041
It's a matter of money? Hmm?

1295
02:07:29,901 --> 02:07:31,981
You're offering me a bribe?

1296
02:07:33,501 --> 02:07:36,711
A bribe? No. No, please.

1297
02:07:37,081 --> 02:07:38,861
It's a gratuity.

1298
02:07:39,231 --> 02:07:40,711
Heil Hitler.!

1299
02:07:44,461 --> 02:07:46,091
Hello, Amon.

1300
02:07:50,101 --> 02:07:51,561
Sit down.

1301
02:07:53,901 --> 02:07:57,241
We give you Jewish girls at five marks a day, Oskar.

1302
02:07:57,381 --> 02:07:59,821
You should kiss us, not them.

1303
02:07:59,831 --> 02:08:03,521
God forbid you ever get a real taste forJewish skirt.

1304
02:08:03,521 --> 02:08:06,991
There's no future in it. They don't have a future.

1305
02:08:07,571 --> 02:08:10,541
That's not just good, old-fashioned, Jew-hating talk.

1306
02:08:11,511 --> 02:08:13,331
It's policy now.

1307
02:08:46,681 --> 02:08:50,601
CHUJOWA GORKA APRIL, 1944

1308
02:08:50,681 --> 02:08:55,181
Department D orders Goeth to exhume and incinerate the bodies of more than

1309
02:08:55,181 --> 02:08:57,371
10,000 Jews killed at Plaszow and the Krakow Ghetto massacre.

1310
02:08:57,371 --> 02:08:59,941
Also los! Bewegung!

1311
02:10:00,781 --> 02:10:02,531
Can you believe this?

1312
02:10:02,721 --> 02:10:05,561
As if I don't have enough to do, they come up with this?

1313
02:10:05,961 --> 02:10:09,831
I have to find every rag buried up here and burn it.

1314
02:10:11,381 --> 02:10:12,251
The party's over, Oskar.

1315
02:10:12,251 --> 02:10:14,501
They're closing us down, sending everybody to Auschwitz.

1316
02:10:14,501 --> 02:10:15,061
When?

1317
02:10:15,061 --> 02:10:17,931
I don't know. As soon as I can arrange the shipments.

1318
02:10:17,931 --> 02:10:20,891
Maybe 30, 40 days. That ought to be fun.

1319
02:10:39,201 --> 02:10:40,801
-I've been talking to Goeth.

1320
02:10:40,801 --> 02:10:43,981
-I know the destination.  These are the evacuation orders.

1321
02:10:44,651 --> 02:10:47,521
I'm to help organize the shipments, put myself on the last train.

1322
02:10:47,521 --> 02:10:49,571
That's not what I was going to say.

1323
02:10:50,411 --> 02:10:53,601
I made Goeth promise me he'll put in a good word for you.

1324
02:10:54,251 --> 02:10:57,581
Nothing bad is going to happen to you there. You'll receive special treatment.

1325
02:10:57,581 --> 02:10:59,291
The directives coming in from Berlin

1326
02:10:59,291 --> 02:11:01,631
mention "Special Treatment" more and more often.

1327
02:11:01,631 --> 02:11:03,591
-I'd like to think that's not what you mean.

1328
02:11:03,591 --> 02:11:05,691
-Preferential treatment.

1329
02:11:05,691 --> 02:11:07,821
-Do we have to invent a whole new language?

1330
02:11:07,821 --> 02:11:09,511
-I think so.

1331
02:11:12,621 --> 02:11:14,601
You're staying, I take it.

1332
02:11:18,251 --> 02:11:20,171
-In Krakow? What on earth for? -What for?

1333
02:11:20,171 --> 02:11:22,471
You have a business to run.

1334
02:11:24,001 --> 02:11:26,321
Of course, you'll have to hire new workers. Poles, I guess.

1335
02:11:26,321 --> 02:11:28,341
They cost a little more, but...

1336
02:11:31,221 --> 02:11:33,241
What are you going to do?

1337
02:11:36,751 --> 02:11:39,111
You ran my business.

1338
02:11:42,471 --> 02:11:44,271
No, I'm going home.

1339
02:11:44,271 --> 02:11:46,311
I've done what I came here for.

1340
02:11:46,311 --> 02:11:49,031
I've got more money than any man can spend in a lifetime.

1341
02:11:59,851 --> 02:12:01,871
Some day

1342
02:12:02,431 --> 02:12:05,321
this is all going to end, you know.

1343
02:12:08,761 --> 02:12:11,361
I was going to say we'll have a drink then.

1344
02:12:15,471 --> 02:12:17,541
I think I better have it now.

1345
02:13:50,261 --> 02:13:52,451
I don't understand.

1346
02:13:53,011 --> 02:13:54,361
I mean, you want these people?

1347
02:13:54,361 --> 02:13:56,921
"These people'"? My people, I want my people.

1348
02:13:56,921 --> 02:13:59,761
Who are you, Moses? Come on, what is this?

1349
02:13:59,761 --> 02:14:01,301
-Where's the money in this? Where's the scam?

1350
02:14:01,301 --> 02:14:02,391
-It's good business.

1351
02:14:02,391 --> 02:14:04,531
It's good business in your opinion.

1352
02:14:04,531 --> 02:14:09,011
You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia.

1353
02:14:09,011 --> 02:14:11,261
Pay for all that and build another camp. Doesn't make any sense.

1354
02:14:11,261 --> 02:14:13,441
-Look, Amon... It's good for me.

1355
02:14:13,441 --> 02:14:15,421
-You're not telling me something.

1356
02:14:15,481 --> 02:14:18,161
I know them. I'm familiar with them.

1357
02:14:18,161 --> 02:14:19,781
I don't have to train them.

1358
02:14:19,781 --> 02:14:20,561
-You're not telling me something. -It's good for you. I'll compensate you.

1359
02:14:20,561 --> 02:14:21,571
-That's right.

1360
02:14:21,571 --> 02:14:22,831
-It's good for the army.

1361
02:14:22,831 --> 02:14:24,891
-You know what I'm going to make? -What?

1362
02:14:25,361 --> 02:14:26,251
-Artillery shells.

1363
02:14:26,251 --> 02:14:27,211
-Everyone is!

1364
02:14:27,211 --> 02:14:28,881
-Tank shells, they need that.

1365
02:14:28,881 --> 02:14:29,761
-Tanks shells, ja.

1366
02:14:29,761 --> 02:14:31,861
-Everybody's happy. -Except me.

1367
02:14:31,861 --> 02:14:34,171
You're probably scamming me somehow.

1368
02:14:34,901 --> 02:14:37,901
If I'm making 100, you've got to be making 300.

1369
02:14:37,941 --> 02:14:40,411
If you admit to 300, then it's 400 actually.

1370
02:14:40,411 --> 02:14:41,261
But how?

1371
02:14:41,261 --> 02:14:42,171
-I just told you.

1372
02:14:42,171 --> 02:14:44,131
-You did, but you didn't.

1373
02:14:46,841 --> 02:14:48,871
Ah, ja, all right, don't tell me.

1374
02:14:48,981 --> 02:14:50,801
I'll go along with it.

1375
02:14:51,481 --> 02:14:53,141
It's just irritating I can't work it out.

1376
02:14:53,141 --> 02:14:54,451
Look

1377
02:14:54,521 --> 02:14:57,301
all you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.

1378
02:14:57,881 --> 02:14:58,961
-What's a person worth to you?

1379
02:14:58,961 --> 02:15:00,411
-No, no, no, no.

1380
02:15:00,411 --> 02:15:02,851
What's one worth to you?

1381
02:15:10,971 --> 02:15:14,821
Poldek Pfefferberg. Mila Pfefferberg.

1382
02:15:15,091 --> 02:15:16,681
And, uh...

1383
02:15:18,931 --> 02:15:21,771
Uh, Stagel, Stagel  -Paul. -Paul Stagel.

1384
02:15:21,771 --> 02:15:23,271
Doctor.

1385
02:15:25,391 --> 02:15:28,471
-The investors. I want all of them.

1386
02:15:28,471 --> 02:15:29,771
-Yes, sir.

1387
02:15:29,881 --> 02:15:32,101
Uh, Fischer. Ismail Fischer.  Fischer, Ismail.

1388
02:15:34,871 --> 02:15:36,521
-Josef Scharf.

1389
02:15:36,521 --> 02:15:38,431
-One moment, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

1390
02:15:38,431 --> 02:15:40,461
Come on, Stern. Scharf, Scharf.

1391
02:15:43,311 --> 02:15:46,251
The children. All the children.

1392
02:15:50,711 --> 02:15:53,131
-Herbert Stier. -Thank you.

1393
02:15:53,231 --> 02:15:54,481
-How many?

1394
02:15:54,481 --> 02:15:57,151
-400, 450.

1395
02:15:59,311 --> 02:16:01,121
More, more.

1396
02:16:24,211 --> 02:16:28,711
-Feigenbaum, Jakob. -Wolf. Wolf Wein.

1397
02:16:33,401 --> 02:16:38,091
Feigenbaum: Lutek, Jakob, Nacha. Yes? Nacha.

1398
02:16:38,091 --> 02:16:41,161
Nacha, that's right.  And Wolf.

1399
02:16:41,811 --> 02:16:43,411
How many?

1400
02:16:45,711 --> 02:16:47,381
-600.

1401
02:16:47,791 --> 02:16:49,351
-More.

1402
02:16:50,351 --> 02:16:53,611
you can do the same thing I'm doing.

1403
02:16:53,621 --> 02:16:54,281
-You might even make money at it. -I don't know.

1404
02:16:54,281 --> 02:16:55,471
Come on, Julius, I know about the extra food and clothes you give them.

1405
02:16:55,471 --> 02:16:59,131
Paid for out of your own pocket. If we make a combined approach...

1406
02:16:59,131 --> 02:17:02,241
we could get more than 4,000 out, mine and yours.

1407
02:17:02,241 --> 02:17:02,701
Oskar...

1408
02:17:02,701 --> 02:17:05,741
We could relocate them in something like safety, in Moravia.

1409
02:17:07,221 --> 02:17:08,721
I don't know.

1410
02:17:10,801 --> 02:17:13,301
How many cigarettes have you smoked tonight?

1411
02:17:13,301 --> 02:17:14,261
Too many.

1412
02:17:14,261 --> 02:17:18,121
For every one... You smoke, I smoke half.

1413
02:17:19,311 --> 02:17:20,581
-I've done all I can.

1414
02:17:20,581 --> 02:17:21,371
-I will not accept that.

1415
02:17:21,371 --> 02:17:22,981
-No, Oskar, I can't do any more.

1416
02:17:22,981 --> 02:17:24,561
-I will not accept that.

1417
02:17:24,561 --> 02:17:26,061
No.

1418
02:17:35,641 --> 02:17:36,721
-How many? How many?

1419
02:17:36,721 --> 02:17:38,511
-850, give or take.

1420
02:17:38,511 --> 02:17:42,511
Give or take what, Stern? Count them. How many?

1421
02:17:52,401 --> 02:17:55,501
That's it. You can finish that page.

1422
02:18:00,341 --> 02:18:04,051
What... did... Goeth... say about this?

1423
02:18:04,051 --> 02:18:08,001
You just told him how many people you needed and...

1424
02:18:10,811 --> 02:18:13,101
You're not buying them.

1425
02:18:15,311 --> 02:18:18,421
You're buying them? You're paying him for each of these names?

1426
02:18:18,421 --> 02:18:21,331
If you were still working for me, I'd expect you to talk me out of it.

1427
02:18:21,331 --> 02:18:23,601
It's costing me a fortune.

1428
02:18:25,391 --> 02:18:28,191
Finish the page and leave one space at the bottom.

1429
02:18:50,101 --> 02:18:51,591
You...

1430
02:18:57,711 --> 02:19:00,331
The list is an absolute good.

1431
02:19:01,871 --> 02:19:04,921
The list... is life.

1432
02:19:06,041 --> 02:19:09,861
All around its margins lies the gulf.

1433
02:19:11,251 --> 02:19:15,161
Oskar, there's a clerical error here at the bottom of the last page.

1434
02:19:15,161 --> 02:19:17,551
No, there's one more name I want to put there.

1435
02:19:17,551 --> 02:19:20,371
I'll never find a maid as well trained as her at Brinnlitz.

1436
02:19:20,371 --> 02:19:22,561
They are all country girls.

1437
02:19:23,441 --> 02:19:24,781
No.

1438
02:19:33,551 --> 02:19:34,861
No.

1439
02:19:35,471 --> 02:19:36,911
-One hand of twenty-one.

1440
02:19:36,911 --> 02:19:37,451
-No.

1441
02:19:37,451 --> 02:19:39,851
-If you win, I pay you 7,400 reichsmarks.

1442
02:19:39,851 --> 02:19:40,341
No.

1443
02:19:40,341 --> 02:19:43,001
-Hit a natural, I make it 14,800.

1444
02:19:43,001 --> 02:19:43,891
No.

1445
02:19:43,891 --> 02:19:46,571
If I win, the girl goes on my list.

1446
02:19:47,481 --> 02:19:49,171
-I can't wager Helen in a card game.

1447
02:19:49,171 --> 02:19:50,481
-Why not?

1448
02:19:50,481 --> 02:19:51,411
-Wouldn't be right.

1449
02:19:51,411 --> 02:19:54,401
-She's just going to Auschwitz Number Two anyway.

1450
02:19:54,401 --> 02:19:56,791
-What difference does it make? -She's not going to Auschwitz.

1451
02:19:57,561 --> 02:20:01,231
I'd never do that to her. No, I want her to come back to Vienna with me.

1452
02:20:01,231 --> 02:20:02,831
I want her to come to work for me there.

1453
02:20:02,831 --> 02:20:04,531
-I want to grow old with her.

1454
02:20:04,531 --> 02:20:06,341
-Are you mad?

1455
02:20:07,161 --> 02:20:10,511
-Amon, you can't take her to Vienna with you.

1456
02:20:10,511 --> 02:20:12,741
-No, of course I can't.

1457
02:20:13,201 --> 02:20:15,491
That's what I'd like to do.

1458
02:20:15,921 --> 02:20:17,741
What I can do, if I'm any sort of a man

1459
02:20:17,741 --> 02:20:19,901
is the next most merciful thing.

1460
02:20:19,931 --> 02:20:23,471
I shall take her into the woods and

1461
02:20:23,471 --> 02:20:26,151
shoot her painlessly in the back of the head.

1462
02:20:35,381 --> 02:20:39,481
What was it you said for a natural 21?

1463
02:20:39,791 --> 02:20:41,831
Was it 14,800?

1464
02:20:43,021 --> 02:20:44,241
Schindlerjuden to these tables!

1465
02:20:44,241 --> 02:20:45,491
Say your names clearly.

1466
02:20:45,491 --> 02:20:47,671
-We are the family Dresner.

1467
02:20:47,671 --> 02:20:50,691
-Juda, Jonas...  Donata and Chaja.

1468
02:20:51,641 --> 02:20:54,071
-We are Rosners. Henry, Manci...

1469
02:20:54,071 --> 02:20:55,251
-And Leo.

1470
02:20:55,251 --> 02:20:55,821
-And our son.

1471
02:20:55,821 --> 02:20:57,281
-I am Olek.

Jakob Levartov.

1481
02:21:19,371 --> 02:21:21,931
-Farber, Rosa. -Farber, Andrzej.

1483

1488
02:21:35,951 --> 02:21:37,621
Marcel Goldberg.

Klipstein, Isak David.

1490
02:21:41,521 --> 02:21:43,421

Zuckermann, Jetti.

1496
02:21:55,121 --> 02:21:56,931
Helen Hirsch.

1497
02:21:58,801 --> 02:22:00,971
The worst is over.

1498
02:22:02,021 --> 02:22:05,271
Men to this transport and women to this transport.

1499
02:22:05,991 --> 02:22:07,491
Be careful.

1500
02:22:07,491 --> 02:22:10,761
Men to this transport and women to this transport.

1501
02:22:10,761 --> 02:22:12,681
Watch your step. Men to this transport and women to this transport.

1502
02:22:51,721 --> 02:22:53,691
Wonderful, Olek

1503
02:22:54,571 --> 02:22:56,021
wonderful.

1504
02:22:56,021 --> 02:22:59,611
You know how we make ice into water?

1505
02:23:01,451 --> 02:23:03,401
Olek, get another one!

1506
02:23:14,471 --> 02:23:20,501
ZWITTAU-BRINNLITZ, CZECHOSLOVAKIA OSKAR SCHINDLER"S HOMETOWN

1507
02:23:43,551 --> 02:23:47,191
You'll be pleased with the level of efficiency I get from these workers.

1508
02:23:49,471 --> 02:23:50,481
Budzyn, under my command...

1509
02:23:50,481 --> 02:23:54,531
was the envy of every other commandant in the labor camp system.

1510
02:23:54,531 --> 02:23:56,071
-The prisoners, however... -Excuse me.

1511
02:23:56,071 --> 02:23:58,651
They would have rather been somewhere else.

1512
02:24:12,641 --> 02:24:16,131
The train with the women has already left plaszow...

1513
02:24:16,131 --> 02:24:18,841
and will be arriving here very shortly.

1514
02:24:19,491 --> 02:24:21,851
I know you've had a long journey.

1515
02:24:22,121 --> 02:24:25,251
But it's only a short walk further to the factory...

1516
02:24:25,251 --> 02:24:27,801
where hot soup and bread

1517
02:24:27,801 --> 02:24:29,461
is waiting for you.

1518
02:24:30,691 --> 02:24:33,081
Welcome to Brinnlitz!

1519
02:24:42,061 --> 02:24:43,551
-Beans in chunt?

1520
02:24:43,551 --> 02:24:45,101
-Beans are the best part.

1521
02:24:45,101 --> 02:24:47,231
I don't like beans.

1522
02:24:47,451 --> 02:24:51,171
Beans and meat and potatoes and bread.

1523
02:24:51,171 --> 02:24:53,731
That's not the way you make chunt.

1524
02:24:57,481 --> 02:24:59,041
-Eggs in chunt?

1525
02:24:59,041 --> 02:25:00,541
-Yes!

1526
02:25:02,891 --> 02:25:04,261
-I don't like chunt.

1527
02:25:04,261 --> 02:25:07,011
-No, you don't.  -What do you like?

1528
02:25:07,011 --> 02:25:08,891
-I like caviar.

1529
02:25:10,431 --> 02:25:13,371
One day on the fire...

1530
02:26:52,901 --> 02:26:56,101
reissig, fuenfunddreissig

1531
02:26:56,101 --> 02:26:57,651
vierzig

1532
02:26:58,051 --> 02:26:59,991
fuenfundvierzig

1533
02:27:13,311 --> 02:27:15,071
-Where are the list makers?

1534
02:27:15,071 --> 02:27:16,891
-Where are the tables?

1535
02:27:19,521 --> 02:27:23,221
Move the line.!

1536
02:27:38,281 --> 02:27:40,501
Mama, where are we?

1537
02:27:43,971 --> 02:27:46,851
-17, 18, 20... -They're in Auschwitz. The train was never routed here.

1538
02:27:46,851 --> 02:27:49,021
Apaperwork mistake.

1539
02:31:31,271 --> 02:31:33,191
Blick hinunter.!

1540
02:31:35,621 --> 02:31:37,811
Die Hand auf die Schulter.!

1541
02:31:38,241 --> 02:31:39,681
-How old are you, mother?

1542
02:31:39,681 --> 02:31:40,931
-Sixty-eight.

1543
02:31:40,931 --> 02:31:42,091
-Cough for me, mother.

1544
02:31:42,091 --> 02:31:46,591
-They say to fall against the fence is a kindness.

1545
02:31:46,591 --> 02:31:49,371
Don't kill yourself against the fence, Clara.

1546
02:31:49,371 --> 02:31:52,411
If you do, you'll never know what happened to you.

1547
02:31:54,851 --> 02:31:56,171
-How old are you, mother?

1548
02:31:56,171 --> 02:31:57,571
-Sixty-six, sir.

1549
02:31:57,571 --> 02:31:58,641
-Sir?

1550
02:31:58,641 --> 02:31:59,841
-Good morning.

1551
02:31:59,841 --> 02:32:02,721
A mistake has been made. We are not supposed to be here.

1552
02:32:02,721 --> 02:32:04,511
We work for Oskar Schindler.

1553
02:32:04,511 --> 02:32:06,371
We are SchindlerJews.

1554
02:32:06,371 --> 02:32:07,901
-Who is Oskar Schindler?

1555
02:32:07,901 --> 02:32:09,791
-He had a factory in Krakow.

1556
02:32:09,791 --> 02:32:11,561
-Enamelware.

1557
02:32:11,561 --> 02:32:13,821
-A pot maker.

1558
02:32:14,341 --> 02:32:16,541
How old are you, mother?

1559
02:32:20,581 --> 02:32:24,321
You are not the only industrialist who needs labor...

1560
02:32:25,761 --> 02:32:27,761
Herr Schindler.

1561
02:32:28,641 --> 02:32:30,281
I remember earlier this year, IG-Farben ordered...

1562
02:32:30,281 --> 02:32:36,081
a trainload of Hungarians for its chemical factory.

1563
02:32:37,091 --> 02:32:40,241
The train came in through the archway...

1564
02:32:40,931 --> 02:32:45,531
and the officer in charge of the selection went immediately to work...

1565
02:32:46,401 --> 02:32:48,901
and sent 2,000 of them...

1566
02:32:48,901 --> 02:32:51,481
straightaway to Special Treatment.

1567
02:32:53,001 --> 02:32:57,921
It is not my task to interfere with the processes that take place down here.

1568
02:32:59,371 --> 02:33:01,761
Why do you think I can help you

1569
02:33:01,761 --> 02:33:04,351
if I can't help IG-Farben?

1570
02:33:04,351 --> 02:33:07,101
Allow me to express the reason.

1571
02:33:15,911 --> 02:33:18,501
I'm not making any judgment about you.

1572
02:33:19,141 --> 02:33:21,731
It's just that I know that in the coming months...

1573
02:33:21,731 --> 02:33:24,861
we're all going to need portable wealth.

1574
02:33:27,881 --> 02:33:30,531
I could have you arrested.

1575
02:33:30,531 --> 02:33:34,781
I'm protected by powerful friends. You should know that.

1576
02:33:37,991 --> 02:33:41,021
I do not say I am accepting them.

1577
02:33:41,821 --> 02:33:45,431
All I say is, I'm not comfortable with them on the table.

1578
02:33:59,811 --> 02:34:02,611
I have a shipment coming in tomorrow.

1579
02:34:03,071 --> 02:34:06,011
I'll cut you 300 units from it.

1580
02:34:12,651 --> 02:34:16,291
-The train comes, we turn it around. -Mmm, yes, yes.

1581
02:34:16,291 --> 02:34:18,341
-It's yours. -I understand.

1582
02:34:18,341 --> 02:34:20,211
I want these.

1583
02:34:23,491 --> 02:34:26,361
You shouldn't get stuck on names.

1584
02:34:33,411 --> 02:34:37,651
That's right. It creates a lot of paperwork.

1585
02:34:37,651 --> 02:34:39,811
Zoldinger, Ernestina.!

1586
02:34:39,811 --> 02:34:41,571
Waldergrun, Hilda.!

1587
02:34:41,571 --> 02:34:43,651
Waldergrun, Leonora.!

1588
02:34:43,651 --> 02:34:45,091
Laast, Anna!

1589
02:34:45,091 --> 02:34:47,241
Pfefferberg, Mila!

1590
02:34:47,241 --> 02:34:48,771
Dresner, Chaja!

1591
02:34:48,771 --> 02:34:50,691
Dresner, Danka!

1592
02:34:50,691 --> 02:34:52,421
Nussbaum, Sidonia!

1593
02:34:52,421 --> 02:34:54,241
Rosner, Manci!

1594
02:34:54,241 --> 02:34:55,651
Hirsch, Helen.!

1595
02:34:55,651 --> 02:34:58,011
Grosz, Chaja Sara.!

1596
02:35:59,111 --> 02:36:02,691
Danka! Danka! Danka!

1597
02:36:02,691 --> 02:36:05,341
No! No! No!

1598
02:36:08,731 --> 02:36:10,751
Hey.! Hey.! Hey.! What are you doing?

1599
02:36:10,751 --> 02:36:15,101
These are mine! These are my workers! They should be on my train!

1600
02:36:15,561 --> 02:36:18,461
They're skilled munitions workers! They're essential!

1601
02:36:18,561 --> 02:36:20,441
Essential girls!

1602
02:36:23,171 --> 02:36:27,551
Their fingers polish the insides of shell metal casings.

1603
02:36:27,551 --> 02:36:30,951
How else am I to polish the inside of a 45 millimeter shell casing?

1604
02:36:30,951 --> 02:36:33,431
You tell me. You tell me!

1605
02:36:35,811 --> 02:36:37,981
Back on the train!

1606
02:36:38,361 --> 02:36:39,871
Back on the train!

1607
02:38:29,511 --> 02:38:33,051
Under Department "W" provisions...

1608
02:38:33,571 --> 02:38:37,211
it is unlawful to kill a worker without just cause.

1609
02:38:38,021 --> 02:38:40,991
Under the Businesses Compensation Fund...

1610
02:38:40,991 --> 02:38:44,481
I am entitled to file damage claims for such deaths.

1611
02:38:45,091 --> 02:38:48,101
If you shoot without thinking...

1612
02:38:48,101 --> 02:38:51,991
you go to prison, I get paid.

1613
02:38:52,131 --> 02:38:54,371
That's how it works.

1614
02:38:54,371 --> 02:38:55,791
So

1615
02:38:55,791 --> 02:38:59,281
there will be no summary executions here.

1616
02:39:00,291 --> 02:39:04,251
There will be no interference of any kind with production.

1617
02:39:04,771 --> 02:39:06,691
In hopes of ensuring that

1618
02:39:06,691 --> 02:39:09,861
guards will no longer be allowed on the factory floor...

1619
02:39:09,861 --> 02:39:12,441
without my authorization.

1620
02:39:18,051 --> 02:39:21,591
For your cooperation, you have my gratitude.

1621
02:39:23,131 --> 02:39:25,241
Come on, come.

1622
02:39:27,811 --> 02:39:30,111
-Come on, boys, come. -Guck dir mal die Buddeln an!

1623
02:39:55,231 --> 02:39:58,401
No doorman or maitre d'

1624
02:39:58,401 --> 02:40:00,891
will ever mistake you again.

1625
02:40:01,061 --> 02:40:02,871
I promise.

1626
02:40:07,041 --> 02:40:08,631
Itzhak.

1627
02:40:09,791 --> 02:40:11,611
-This is Itzhak Stern, my accountant. Itzhak...

1628
02:40:11,611 --> 02:40:13,251
-You must be Mrs. Schindler.

1629
02:40:13,251 --> 02:40:14,341
-It's a pleasure.

1630
02:40:14,341 --> 02:40:16,041
-Emilie has volunteered to work in the clinic.

1631
02:40:16,041 --> 02:40:17,171
-Very generous of you.

1632
02:40:17,171 --> 02:40:17,731
-I know.

1633
02:40:17,731 --> 02:40:20,321
We need to talk when you have a moment.

1634
02:40:20,611 --> 02:40:23,011
This is my wife, Stern. I don't keep any secrets from my spouse.

1635
02:40:23,011 --> 02:40:26,561
Oskar, please, attend to business. It's much more attractive.

1636
02:40:26,851 --> 02:40:27,811
-Madam. -Hello.  What is it?

1637
02:40:27,811 --> 02:40:30,531
We've received an angry complaint from the Armaments Board.

1638
02:40:30,531 --> 02:40:32,871
The artillery shells, tank shells, rocket casings...

1639
02:40:32,871 --> 02:40:35,241
Apparently all of them have failed quality control tests.

1640
02:40:35,241 --> 02:40:37,251
That's to be expected.

1641
02:40:37,251 --> 02:40:39,651
Start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans. This is a precise business.

1642
02:40:39,651 --> 02:40:40,411
-I'll write them a letter.

1643
02:40:40,411 --> 02:40:41,731
-They're withholding payment.

1644
02:40:41,731 --> 02:40:43,171
Sure, so would I, so would you.

1645
02:40:43,171 --> 02:40:45,601
I wouldn't worry. We'll get it right one of these days.

1646
02:40:45,601 --> 02:40:49,371
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.

1647
02:40:50,051 --> 02:40:53,471
They could shut us down, send us back to Auschwitz.

1648
02:40:55,421 --> 02:40:58,531
I'll call around, find out where we can buy shells.

1649
02:40:58,531 --> 02:41:01,021
Pass them off as ours.

1650
02:41:01,021 --> 02:41:02,171
I don't see the difference. Whether they're made here...

1651
02:41:02,171 --> 02:41:03,421
-You don't see a difference? I see a difference. -You'll lose a lot of money.

1652
02:41:03,421 --> 02:41:05,251
Fewer shells will be made.

1653
02:41:05,251 --> 02:41:05,801
Stern

1654
02:41:05,801 --> 02:41:09,091
if this factory ever produces...

1655
02:41:09,091 --> 02:41:11,271
a shell that can actually be fired, I'll be very unhappy.

1656
02:41:12,251 --> 02:41:14,551
-Hello, madam. -How do you do?

1657
02:41:27,971 --> 02:41:29,951
How are you doing, Rabbi?

1658
02:41:30,341 --> 02:41:31,901
Rabbi!

1659
02:41:34,441 --> 02:41:36,531
Good, Herr Direktor.

1660
02:41:38,051 --> 02:41:40,031
Sun's going down.

1661
02:41:42,461 --> 02:41:44,441
Yes, it is.

1662
02:41:45,761 --> 02:41:48,091
What day is this? Friday?

1663
02:41:48,091 --> 02:41:49,541
It is Friday, isn't it?

1664
02:41:49,541 --> 02:41:51,071
Is it?

1665
02:41:54,851 --> 02:41:59,161
What's the matter with you? You should be preparing for the Sabbath.

1666
02:41:59,751 --> 02:42:01,371
Shouldn't you?

1667
02:42:08,261 --> 02:42:12,641
I've got some wine. In my office. Come.

1668
02:42:50,931 --> 02:42:54,641
For the seven months it was fully operational,

1669
02:42:54,741 --> 02:42:58,461
Schindler"s Brinnlitz munitions factory

1670
02:42:58,731 --> 02:43:03,001
was a model of non-production.

1671
02:43:03,441 --> 02:43:05,281
During this same period

1672
02:43:05,281 --> 02:43:09,661
he spent millions of reichmarks to sustain

1673
02:43:10,151 --> 02:43:13,501
his workers and bribe Reich officials. Gut Shabbos.

1674
02:43:24,741 --> 02:43:26,711
What?

1675
02:43:27,811 --> 02:43:30,201
Do you have any money, uh, hidden away someplace...

1676
02:43:31,171 --> 02:43:34,361
that I don't know about?

1677
02:43:38,471 --> 02:43:40,281
No.

1678
02:43:45,091 --> 02:43:47,611
Why? Am I broke?

1679
02:43:51,591 --> 02:43:53,401
Well...

1680
02:43:54,821 --> 02:44:00,341
Yesterday morning, at 2.'41 a. M...

1681
02:44:00,931 --> 02:44:04,341
at General Eisenhower's headquarters...

1682
02:44:04,771 --> 02:44:07,221
General Jodl...

1683
02:44:07,301 --> 02:44:11,451
signed the Act of Unconditional Surrender...

1684
02:44:11,521 --> 02:44:17,311
of all German land sea and air forces in Europe...

1685
02:44:17,311 --> 02:44:20,701
to the Allied Expeditionary Force...

1686
02:44:21,091 --> 02:44:25,411
and simultaneously to the Soviet High Command.

1687
02:44:25,761 --> 02:44:29,241
The German war is, therefore, at an end.

1688
02:44:29,731 --> 02:44:31,431
But let us not forget for a moment...

1689
02:44:31,431 --> 02:44:34,681
I think it's time the guards came into the factory.

1690
02:44:38,951 --> 02:44:40,961
Japan, with all her treachery and greed.

1691
02:44:40,961 --> 02:44:43,671
The unconditional surrender of Germany has just been announced.

1692
02:44:44,191 --> 02:44:48,911
At midnight tonight, the war is over.

1693
02:44:50,631 --> 02:44:56,411
Tomorrow you'll begin the process...

1694
02:44:58,721 --> 02:45:01,081
of looking for survivors of your families.

1695
02:45:02,051 --> 02:45:04,701
In most cases, you won't find them.

1696
02:45:05,251 --> 02:45:07,931
After six long years of murder...

1697
02:45:08,131 --> 02:45:11,351
victims are being mourned throughout the world.

1698
02:45:13,401 --> 02:45:15,411
We've survived.

1699
02:45:16,351 --> 02:45:19,711
Many of you have come up to me and thanked me.

1700
02:45:22,301 --> 02:45:24,831
Thank yourselves.

1701
02:45:25,701 --> 02:45:28,291
Thank your fearless Stern...

1702
02:45:28,771 --> 02:45:31,301
and others among you who worried about you...

1703
02:45:31,301 --> 02:45:33,691
and faced death at every moment.

1704
02:45:37,571 --> 02:45:40,251
I'm a member of the Nazi party.

1705
02:45:40,421 --> 02:45:43,101
I'm a munitions manufacturer.

1706
02:45:43,391 --> 02:45:46,011
I'm a profiteer of slave labor.

1707
02:45:46,051 --> 02:45:48,761
I am a criminal.

1708
02:45:49,701 --> 02:45:53,371
At midnight you'll be free, and I'll be hunted.

1709
02:45:55,171 --> 02:45:58,531
I shall remain with you until five minutes after midnight...

1710
02:45:58,531 --> 02:46:01,731
after which time, and I hope you'll forgive me...

1711
02:46:01,731 --> 02:46:04,091
I have to flee.

1712
02:46:06,371 --> 02:46:09,831
I know you have received orders from our commandant...

1713
02:46:09,831 --> 02:46:11,971
which he has received from his superiors

1714
02:46:11,971 --> 02:46:14,941
to dispose of the population of this camp.

1715
02:46:15,331 --> 02:46:17,561
Now would be the time to do it.

1716
02:46:17,561 --> 02:46:20,051
Here they are, they're all here.

1717
02:46:20,671 --> 02:46:23,231
This is your opportunity.

1718
02:46:27,071 --> 02:46:29,521
Or you could leave...

1719
02:46:30,691 --> 02:46:33,091
and return to your families as men...

1720
02:46:33,091 --> 02:46:35,291
instead of murderers.

1721
02:47:15,521 --> 02:47:18,931
In memory of the countless victims among your people...

1722
02:47:19,421 --> 02:47:22,961
I ask us to observe three minutes of silence.

1723
02:48:16,031 --> 02:48:17,411
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

1724
02:48:17,411 --> 02:48:19,321
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

1725
02:48:21,381 --> 02:48:23,001
Open wide.

1726
02:48:24,901 --> 02:48:26,881
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

1727
02:48:44,671 --> 02:48:46,871
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

1728
02:49:09,981 --> 02:49:13,231
As soon as peace occurs, I want...

1729
02:49:14,981 --> 02:49:17,981
um, I want that cloth distributed to the workers.

1730
02:49:18,141 --> 02:49:20,321
Two and a half meters each.

1731
02:49:20,871 --> 02:49:23,911
Also, each person is to get a bottle of vodka.

1732
02:49:23,911 --> 02:49:26,871
They won't drink it. They know its value.

1733
02:49:26,981 --> 02:49:30,081
Likewise those Egipshi cigarettes we organized.

1734
02:49:30,341 --> 02:49:33,341
It'll be done. Everything you ask.

1735
02:49:52,831 --> 02:49:56,761
We've written a letter, trying to explain things...

1736
02:49:56,871 --> 02:49:58,971
in case you are captured.

1737
02:50:01,161 --> 02:50:03,641
Every worker has signed it.

1738
02:50:13,891 --> 02:50:15,611
Thank you.

1739
02:50:41,671 --> 02:50:43,671
It is Hebrew, from the Talmud.

1740
02:50:43,671 --> 02:50:44,221
It says

1741
02:50:44,221 --> 02:50:48,221
"Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire."

1742
02:51:26,851 --> 02:51:29,341
I could have got more out.

1743
02:51:31,171 --> 02:51:32,851
I could have got more.

1744
02:51:32,851 --> 02:51:33,761
I don't know.

1745
02:51:33,761 --> 02:51:38,051
If I just...  I could have got more.

1746
02:51:38,051 --> 02:51:40,821
Oskar, there are 1,100 people who are alive because of you.

1747
02:51:40,821 --> 02:51:43,181
Look at them.

1748
02:51:44,061 --> 02:51:46,241
If I'd made more money.

1749
02:51:50,111 --> 02:51:53,691
I threw away so much money.

1750
02:51:56,381 --> 02:51:58,681
You have no idea.

1751
02:51:59,491 --> 02:52:00,671
If I had just...

1752
02:52:00,671 --> 02:52:05,111
There will be generations because of what you did.

1753
02:52:05,701 --> 02:52:08,061
I didn't do enough.

1754
02:52:08,161 --> 02:52:10,301
You did so much.

1755
02:52:14,051 --> 02:52:15,861
This car.

1756
02:52:16,801 --> 02:52:18,841
Goeth would've bought this car.

1757
02:52:18,841 --> 02:52:22,901
Why did I keep the car? Ten people right there.

1758
02:52:25,991 --> 02:52:27,681
Ten people.

1759
02:52:29,311 --> 02:52:31,171
Ten more people.

1760
02:52:33,661 --> 02:52:36,791
This pin two people.

1761
02:52:39,591 --> 02:52:41,321
This is gold.

1762
02:52:41,321 --> 02:52:43,201
Two more people.

1763
02:52:43,201 --> 02:52:46,271
He would have given me two for it; at least one.

1764
02:52:46,271 --> 02:52:48,881
He would have given me one, one more.

1765
02:52:51,651 --> 02:52:53,541
One more person.

1766
02:52:55,901 --> 02:52:57,921
A person, Stern.

1767
02:52:59,421 --> 02:53:01,231
For this.

1768
02:53:03,581 --> 02:53:06,881
I could have gotten...

1769
02:53:06,881 --> 02:53:10,971
one more person and I didn't.

1770
02:53:11,941 --> 02:53:14,051
And l-I didn't!

1771

Don't go east, that's for sure.  They hate you there.

1777
02:55:14,781 --> 02:55:17,751
I wouldn't go west either, if I were you.

1778
02:55:19,421 --> 02:55:21,651
We could use some food.

1788
02:57:14,921 --> 02:57:19,451
in Jerusalem, and invited to plant a tree in the Avenue of the Righteous.
