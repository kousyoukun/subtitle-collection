man is? I don't know.

30
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,439
Let's get together,
please.

31
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:23,199
Smile. Good.

32
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,720
Yes, sir.

33
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,279
Bring them over
a round of drinks.

34
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,560
Very good, sir. And who
shall I say th-they are from?

35
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,560
You can say
they are from me.

36
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,600
From the gentleman.
Where?

37
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,480
Do you know him?

38
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,839
Find out who he is.

39
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,759
Yes, sir.

40
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,839
Agnieszka, I would
give anything...

41
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,879
to hear you
sing tonight.

42
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:51,199
But I know you won't.

43
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,399
You embarrass me.

44
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:05,519
What's he doing?

45
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,680
Stay here.

46
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,959
How are you doing?

47
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,120
You'd leave a woman alone at
the table in a place like this?

48
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,959
Sweetheart, you're the
picture of loneliness.

49
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,920
Oh.

50
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,319
Mmm, what a lovely fragrance.
You are breaking my heart.

51
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,839
An extra chair, please.
Vodka for my friend.

52
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,360
And for the lady?
Pernod.

64
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,720
Thank you. I'll tell you
what I mean by cooperative.

65
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,040
Two days after the law is passed
that allJews have to wear the star,

66
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,160
theJewish tailors are turning
them out by the gross...

67
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,560
in a variety of fabrics
at three zloty each.

68
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,480
Tell me about
your cellar wines.

69
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,920
I have an excellent German
Riesling. 1937. Mmm, French.

70
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,600
A Bordeaux. Chateau Latour,
'28, '29? No, I'm sorry.

71
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,039
It's as if they have no idea
what kind of law it is.

72
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,960
As if it's the emblem
of a riding club.

73
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,080
A Margaux, '29? No,
no, we don't have that.

74
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,399
Burgundy then? A
Romanee-Conti, '37? Yes.

75
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,279
It's human nature.
"We'll do this to avoid that. "

76
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,440
That's what they have done
since thousands of years.

77
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,679
It's what they do.
They weather the storm.

78
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,639
But this storm is different. This is
not the Romans. This storm is the SS.

Yes, sir.

89
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,360
Who is that man?

90
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,519
That...
That's Oskar Schindler!

To Krakow!

96
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,799
An alleJuden!

97
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:27,559
Ab sofort ist es allen Juden
untersagt...

98
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:31,600
Fleisch aufkoscher Art
zuzubereiten.

99
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,840
Meldung an alleJuden.
Ab sofort...

100
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:52,679
THE JUDENRAT The Jewish Council comprised of 24 elected Jews
personally responsible for carrying out the orders of the regime

101
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Rabbi... Private property
cannot be confiscated.

102
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,519
How long are the schools going
to be closed? I do not know.

103
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,720
Article 47: Pillage is formally
prohibited. You don't know anything!

104
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,679
I am familiar with the Hague
Convention. Religious...

105
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,799
They come into our house and tell
us we don't live there anymore.

106
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,639
It now belongs
to a certain SS officer.

107
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,759
Please. I only know
what they tell me.

108
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,960
And what they tell me
changes from day to day.

109
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,000
Aren't you supposed
to be able to help?

110
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,039
I mean, what if I just
took this thing off?

111
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,759
What are they going to do
about it? They will shoot you.

112
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,759
Why don't you stop this
silly talk? Itzhak Stern!

113
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,960
I'm looking
for Itzhak Stern.

114
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,519
Are you Itzhak Stern
or not?

115
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,559
I am.
Where can we talk?

116
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,519
There's a company you did the
books for on Lipowa Street.

117
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,960
Made what?
Pots and pans?

118
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
By law, I have to tell you,
sir, I'm a Jew.

119
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,799
Well, I'm a German.
So there we are.

120
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,080
A good company, you
think? Modestly successful.

121
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,600
I know nothing about enamelware. Do you?

122
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,039
I was just
the accountant.

123
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,440
Simple engineering though,
wouldn't you think?

124
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,759
Change the machines around,
whatever you do,

125
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:18,120
you could make other
things, couldn't you?

126
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:22,559
Field kits, mess kits.
Army contracts.

127
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,039
Once the war ends, forget
it, but for now it's great.

128
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,240
You can make a fortune,
don't you think?

129
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,600
I think most people right now
have other priorities.

130
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,440
Like what?

131
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,840
I'm sure you'll do just fine
once you get the contracts.

132
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:39,879
In fact, the worse things get,
the better you'll do.

133
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,279
Oh, well, I can get the signatures
I need. That's the easy part.

134
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,960
Finding the money to buy
the company, that's hard.

135
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,879
You don't have
any money?

136
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,879
Not that kind of money.
You know anybody?

137
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,759
Jews, yeah.

138
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,639
Investors. You must
have contacts...

139
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,559
in theJewish business
community working here.

140
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,279
What community? Jews can
no longer own businesses.

141
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,320
That's why this one's in
receivership. But they wouldn't own it.

142
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,039
I'd own it. I'd pay them back
in product... pots and pans.

143
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,960
Pots and pans. Something they can use.

144
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,840
Something they can
feel in their hands.

145
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:16,120
They can trade it on the black
market, do whatever they want.

146
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,519
Everybody's happy.

147
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,799
If you want, you could
run the company for me.

148
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,840
Let me understand.

149
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:31,600
They'd put up all the money,
I'd do all the work.

150
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:34,759
What, if you don't mind
my asking, would you do?

151
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,200
I'd make sure it's known
the company's in business.

152
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,360
I'd see that it had
a certain panache.

153
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,080
That's what I'm good at,
not the work. Not the work.

154
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:45,559
The presentation.

155
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm sure I don't know anybody
who'll be interested in this.

156
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:11,240
Well, they should be,
Itzhak Stern.

157
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,000
Tell them they should be.

158
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:26,519
Achtung! Achtung!

159
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,240
An alleJuden...
Ab sofort ist es verboten...

160
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,679
Vere dignum et justum est,
aequum et salutare,

161
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:41,039
nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere,

162
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,360
Domine Sancte, Pater Omnipotens,
Aeterne Deus.

163
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,799
I've got a client who'll sell
marks for zloty at 2.45 to 1.

164
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,039
Wool, mink collar.
It's a nice coat.

165
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,960
She'll trade it
for ration coupons.

166
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:55,320
Wicks, for lamps. You
have a truckload of wicks?

167
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,399
What am I going to do with a truckload
of wicks? Nine by 12, nine by 14.

168
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,360
I don't know.
Big, beautiful, Persian.

169
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,240
Lumen aeternum mundo effudit...

170
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,639
Psst.
What?

171
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,559
You don't recognize this?
It's shoe polish.

172
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:11,960
In metal containers? You
asked for shoe polish.

173
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,200
In metal containers. This is
glass. In metal containers.

174
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,120
It's not what I asked
for. What's the difference?

175
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,039
What's the difference?
What's the difference?

176
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,120
Shh! My client sold it to his client,

177
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,000
who sold it
to the German Army.

178
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,279
Only by the time it got there, because of
the freezing cold, it broke. All 10,000 units.

179
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,559
Mmm, ooh, ooh, ooh.
This is not my problem.

180
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,519
This is not his problem.
This is not your problem?

181
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,039
This is not my problem. All right.

182
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,879
The German Army wants to
find out where it came from.

183
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,159
I am going to make sure they
find out. Now it's your problem.

184
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,279
You be quiet!

185
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,000
Metal
containers.

186
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,720
Hello.

187
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:52,639
Pardon me for interfering,
but that's a nice shirt.

188
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,960
Nice shirt.

189
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,200
Do you know where I can
find a nice shirt like that?

190
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,919
...laudare, benedicere
et predicare.

191
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,440
Like this?

192
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,440
It's illegal to buy or sell
anything on the street.

193
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:13,679
We don't do that.
We're here to pray.

194
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:18,320
Jesum Christum Dominum Nostrum...

195
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,039
Do you have any idea how much a shirt
like this costs? Nice things cost money.

196
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,200
...adorant Dominationes,
tremunt Potestates.

197
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,519
Coeli coelorumque
virtutes ac Beata Seraphim...

198
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,679
socia exultatione
concelebrant...

199
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,000
How many?

200
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,919
I'm going to need some other
things, too, as things come up.

201
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
This won't be a problem.
From time to time.

202
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,960
Achtung! Achtung!

203
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,279
MARCH 20, 1941
DEADLINE FOR ENTERING THE GHETTO

204
00:16:54,559 --> 00:17:06,200
Edi

205
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,240
- Name? Adresse?
- Formular ausfuellen!

206
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:34,680
Weiter, weiter!
Nicht draengeln!

207
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:37,200
Kommen Sie hierher!
Stellen Sie sich doch an!

208
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,919
Achtung, achtung!
AlleJuden sind verpflichtet...

209
00:18:25,954 --> 00:18:29,319
im abgesonderten
juedischen Bezirk zu wohnen.

210
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,359
Nichteinhaltung der Meldepflicht
bei der Einwohnerbehoerde...

211
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,240
verstoesst gegen das Edikt 44/91
und fuehrt zur Anzeige...

212
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:37,839
beim Militaergericht.

213
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,440
This is obviously the right place.
How are you doing? Herr Schindler.

214
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:55,440
Good-bye, Jews!
Good-bye, Jews!

215
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:59,559
Good-bye, Jews!

216
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,160
Good-bye, Jews!
Good-bye, Jews!

217
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,039
This iz the vechteka, Moyshe. Ojciec.

218
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,039
Nyne, this kan
neash zyane.

219
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:26,279
Oh, my God.

220
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:29,640
Oy, God.
Oh, my God.

221
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:38,880
Oh, my God.

222
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,759
It could not be better.

223
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:50,440
It could be worse.
How? Tell me.

224
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:53,319
How on earth could it
possibly be worse?

225
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,880
Dzien dobry.

226
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,240
Dzien dobry.
Dzien dobry.

227
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:02,000
Dzien dobry.

228
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:04,400
Dzien dobry.
Dzien dobry.

229
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:09,640
Hey, Goldberg.
Poldek.

230
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,880
What's this? Uh, the Judenrat
has its own police now.

231
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,599
You don't say.
Ordnungsdienst.

232
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,119
I'm a policeman now, could you
believe it? It's hard to believe.

233
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,079
Oh, no, it's not hard to believe.

234
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,480
It's a good racket, Poldek.
The only racket here.

235
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:26,839
Look, maybe I could put in a good
word for you with my superiors.

236
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,000
Your superiors? Come on, they
are not as bad as everyone says.

237
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:34,160
Well, they're worse than everyone
says, but it's a lot of money.

238
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,759
A lot of money.

239
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,480
Give me my
housing assignment.

240
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:43,799
Come on. You look funny
in that hat, Goldberg.

241
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,119
You look like a clown,
you know?

242
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,200
He's a very important man.

243
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,960
Just give him
two minutes of your time.

244
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:59,279
Since when did time cost money?
Just sit down and listen.

245
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,519
Please.
Sir?

246
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:07,039
For each thousand you invest,
I will repay you with...

247
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:09,200
Two hundred. 200 kilos
of enamelware a month,

248
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,119
to begin in July and to
continue for one year.

249
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,799
After which time, we're even.
That's it. It's very simple.

250
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,680
Not good enough. It's not good enough.

251
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:19,920
Not good enough?

252
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,920
Look where you're living. Look where
you've been put. "Not good enough. "

253
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,440
A couple of months ago you'd
be right, not anymore.

254
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,519
Money's still money.

255
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,200
No, it is not.

256
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,279
That's why we're here.

257
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:37,240
Trade goods...
that's the only currency...

258
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,160
that'll be worth
anything in the ghetto.

259
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,480
Things have changed,
my friend.

260
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,519
Did I call
this meeting?

261
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:47,880
You told Mr. Stern
you wanted to speak to me.

262
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,480
I'm here.
I've made you a fair offer.

263
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,319
Fair would be
a percentage in the company.

264
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,519
Forget the whole thing.

265
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,759
Get out.

266
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:06,759
How do we know that you
will do what you say?

267
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,680
Because I said I would.

268
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,880
You want a contract?
To be upheld by what court?

269
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,799
I said what I'll do.
That's our contract.

270
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:19,119
...mielismy racje.

271
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:35,599
Piec, szesc, siedem...

272
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,119
osiem, dziewiec.

273
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,279
The standard SS rate for Jewish
skilled labor is seven marks a day,

274
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:57,160
five for unskilled
and women.

275
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,160
This is what you pay
the Reich Economic Office.

276
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,640
TheJews themselves
receive nothing.

277
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,960
Poles you pay wages. Generally,
they get a little more.

278
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,480
Are you listening? What
was that about the SS?

279
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:11,759
The rate? The what?

280
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,279
TheJewish worker's salary... you pay it
directly to the SS, not to the worker.

281
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:17,359
He gets nothing.
But it's less.

282
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
It's less than what I
would pay a Pole. It's less.

283
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:22,319
That's the point
I'm trying to make.

284
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,880
Poles cost more.

285
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,359
Why should I hire Poles?

286
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,200
An enamelware factory
over at, uh, Lipowa Street.

287
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:36,079
It, uh, it, um...
It's owned by a German.

288
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,160
But it's outside the ghetto, so
you can barter for extra goods...

289
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,359
for eggs, I don't know
what you need...

290
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,440
with the Polish workers.
You can't get it here.

291
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,599
Also, he's asking for ten healthy
women for the... I am healthy.

292
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,559
Bring your sister, okay?

293
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,039
Chodz.

294
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:00,359
You need to convince them you have a
trade, something valuable to the war effort.

295
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,599
Like what? What if you
don't? I'm a musician.

296
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,119
Your name goes on a list.
And they put you on trucks...

297
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,240
No, no, no, that's not
true. You're a musician?

298
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:10,720
Yeah. I'd find a good
hiding place if I were you.

299
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,079
I'm not going to hide like some
animal. There are places to hide.

300
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:21,359
Der Naechste!

301
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,680
I'm a graduate
of the University of Lwow.

302
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:27,880
I used to work at the
hydroelectric station in Roznow...

303
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,799
Blauschein.

304
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,680
I'm gonna get the necessary papers
because this card is no good anymore.

305
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:39,079
You can stay in this line all
day, you'll still get one of these.

306
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,759
They are no good. You'll
have to leave the line now,

307
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:47,240
then you'll get a blue card, a Blauschein,
to say that you are an essential worker.

308
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,279
I'll get these papers
for you at Pankiewicz.

309
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,279
Pharmacist.
Just there, look.

310
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:54,200
Guess who is here?

311
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,839
Poldek! Enjoying
the weather, Poldek?

312
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,799
Enjoying the lines?
Need some shoe polish?

313
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:02,279
In a metal container
maybe?

314
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:06,640
Not essential? I think you
misunderstand the meaning of the word.

315
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,519
No Blauschein, sir.
Stand over there.

316
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:12,240
Move. Next!

317
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:14,519
What do you mean,
"Not essential"?

318
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:20,079
I teach history and literature.
Since when is not essential?

319
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:27,480
He's a metal polisher.

320
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:36,759
It was not right? It's very
good. He's 53 years old.

321
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,799
It's too new. Mmm. Thank you.

322
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,039
You're crazy. You
left it in your drawer.

323
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:52,279
How many times
have I told you?

324
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:54,960
Your work certificate you keep
in your pocket at all times.

325
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,920
And you leave everything
in your drawer.

326
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,279
How many times I've told you?

327
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,480
I'm a metal polisher.

328
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,400
Take the round sheet of tin,

329
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,200
dip it in soap emulsion.

330
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,160
Then place it centrally
in the press.

331
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,039
We obtain the soup pot.
The soup pot.

332
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:43,359
Soup pot.

333
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,480
Grosz, Mrs. Grosz,
stay together.

334
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:55,519
Sir, I have ten work permits here
for the Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik,

335
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:58,319
cosigned by Mr. Bankier
and myself.

336
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,880
If it's carbonized,
clean it with a file.

337
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,519
But don't touch both the
electrodes at the same time.

338
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,680
You'll get electrocuted.
Here, have a try.

339
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,119
Roll the metal
under the press,

340
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,519
but be very careful
unless you want your fingers...

341
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,319
to become part
of the teapot.

342
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:27,359
Occupation? I'm a
writer. I play the flute.

343
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,720
But Moses is
a skilled metalworker.

344
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,960
He can make tin pots.
He can make tanks.

345
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,880
He can make whatever
Mr. Schindler asks.

346
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,440
He's highly skilled.
Give him your card.

347
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:39,839
Moses, give him your card.

348
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:44,000
Now, dip the basin
with the tongs...

349
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,519
into the enamel solution.

350
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,720
And after swiveling it around,
carefully place it aside to drip dry.

351
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,920
And whatever he asks you, allow me
just to represent you and speak for you.

352
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,960
Don't say a word.

353
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,359
Filing, billing, keeping track
of my appointments, shorthand.

354
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,559
Typing, obviously. How is
your typing? Uh, all right.

355
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,480
Please.

356
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,720
You need a secretary.
Pick one.

357
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:09,519
I don't know how. They're
all so... qualified.

358
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:12,400
You have to choose.

359
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,319
Prosze sie ladnie usmiechac.
Big smile. Big smile.

360
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,720
Uwaga.

361
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,240
If you would,
look after my guest.

362
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:45,400
Um, boxed teas are good.
Coffee, pate, um...

363
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,480
kielbasa sausage, cheeses,
Beluga caviar. Yes.

364
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:51,279
And, of course, who could live
without German cigarettes?

365
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,480
Get me as many
as you can find.

366
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,559
And some more fresh fruit.

367
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,319
The real rarities...
oranges, lemons, pineapples.

368
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,000
I need several boxes of
Cuban cigars. The best. Yes.

369
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:04,680
And dark, unsweetened chocolate. Not in the
shape ofladyfingers, the chunk chocolate.

370
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:07,799
Yes. Big as my hand, you
sample at wine tastings.

371
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,920
We're going to need lots
of cognac. The best, Hennessy.

372
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,200
Dom Perignon champagne.
Um, get L 'espadon sardines...

373
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:19,119
and, oh,
try to find nylon stockings.

374
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:24,680
It is my distinct pleasure
to announce...

375
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:30,119
the fully operational status
of Deutsche Email Fabrik...

376
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,400
Patrzjakies szmaty!

377
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,759
Manufacturers of superior
enamelware crockery...

378
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:40,039
expressly designed
and crafted for military use.

379
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:42,640
Utilizing only
the most modern equipment,

380
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,599
D.E.F. 's staff of highly-skilled and
experienced artisans andjourneymen...

381
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,079
deliver a product
of unparalleled quality,

382
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,960
enabling me to proffer, with
absolute confidence and pride,

383
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,519
a full line
of field and kitchenware...

384
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:01,519
unsurpassable in all respects
by my competitors.

385
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:04,160
See attached list
and available colors.

386
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,839
Anticipating the enclosed bids
will meet with your approval.

387
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,559
Made in Havana, Cuba. Looking forward to
a long and mutually prosperous association.

388
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,799
Look at this. I extend to you in
advance my sincerest gratitude...

389
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:18,680
and very best regards.
Oskar Schindler.

390
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,000
Yeah, I need 700 gross
from here for next Thursday.

391
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:24,720
Nine hundred... No, make
it ten for Wednesday.

392
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,519
All this stuff here goes to Madritsch's
factory on Tuesday of next week.

393
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,960
My father was fond of saying,
"You need three things in life:

394
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,920
"A good doctor,
a forgiving priest...

395
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,160
and a clever accountant. "

396
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,279
The first two...
I've never had much use for.

397
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:04,720
But the third...

398
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,079
Just pretend,
for Christ's sake.

399
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:19,759
Is that all?

400
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,440
I'm trying to thank you.

401
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,480
I'm saying I couldn't
have done this without you.

402
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,720
The usual thing would be
to acknowledge my gratitude.

403
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,440
It would also, by the way,
be the courteous thing.

404
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,240
You're welcome.

405
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:54,960
Get out of here.

406
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,839
Klonowska, who is it?

407
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:22,359
She's so embarrassed.
Look at her.

408
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:36,079
You know something?
You would like her.

409
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:38,000
Oskar, please.
What?

410
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:40,400
I don't have to like her... just
because you do. You would, though.

411
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,119
It doesn't
work that way.

412
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:58,160
You've done well here.

413
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,920
You look wonderful.

414
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,039
Be careful of the step,
miss. Mrs. Schindler, Marek.

415
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,039
It's not a charade, all this?
How could it be a charade?

416
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,400
The clothes, the car, the
apartment. Wait a minute.

417
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,280
Take a guess how many people
are on my payroll. Oskar.

418
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,840
My father, at the height of his
success, had 50. I've got 350.

419
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,000
350 workers on the factory
floor, with one purpose.

420
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,199
To make pots and pans?

421
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,079
To make money.
For me.

422
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:55,679
Does anyone
ask about me?

423
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:00,199
Back home?
Everybody.

424
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,079
All the time.

425
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,280
Hmm.

426
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,719
They won't soon forget the name
Schindler here, I can tell you that.

427
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:16,199
"Oskar Schindler,"
they'll say.

428
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,559
"Everybody
remembers him.

429
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:23,880
"He did something
extraordinary.

430
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,840
"He did something
no one else did.

431
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,079
"He came here
with nothing...

432
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:34,960
"a suitcase...

433
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:40,400
"and built a bankrupt company
into a major manufactory.

434
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,960
"And left with
a steamer trunk...

435
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:48,440
"Two steamer trunks
full of money,

436
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,559
all the riches
of the world. "

437
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:54,480
Hmm.

438
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:57,719
It's comforting to see
that nothing's changed.

439
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,199
You're wrong, Emilie.

440
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,639
There's no way I could have
known this before,

441
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:07,000
but there was always
something missing.

442
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:11,000
In every business I tried, I can
see now, it wasn't me that failed.

443
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:13,719
Something was missing.

444
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,199
Even if I'd known what it was, there's
nothing I could have done about it...

445
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,679
because you can't
create this thing.

446
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,840
And it makes all the difference in
the world between success and failure.

447
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,320
Luck?

448
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:34,480
War.

449
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,559
Should I stay?

450
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:05,199
It's a beautiful city.

451
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,000
I asked you
if I should stay.

452
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,960
It's up to you.

453
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,199
Promise me, Oskar, no doorman
or maitre d' will ever presume...

454
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,400
I'm anyone other than Mrs.
Schindler, and I'll stay.

455
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:30,719
Good-bye, darling.

456
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:50,719
I could try to read this or I could
eat my lunch while it's still hot.

457
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,679
We're doing well?

458
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,000
Yes. Better this month than last?

459
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:56,199
Yes. Any reason to think
next month will be worse?

460
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:59,360
The war could end.

461
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,360
What? There is a machinist outside...

462
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,400
who'd like to thank you
personally for giving him a job.

463
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,000
Every day he comes. He's very
grateful. It'll just take a minute.

464
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,320
Mr. Lowenstein?

465
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,960
I want to thank you, sir,

466
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:39,679
for giving me
the opportunity to work.

467
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,559
You're welcome. I'm sure
you're doing a great job.

468
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:46,760
The SS beat me up.
They would have killed me,

469
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,360
but I am essential to the
war effort, thanks to you.

470
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,280
That's great.

471
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,880
I work hard for you.

472
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,800
I'm sure you do. I'll
continue to work hard for you.

473
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,760
That's great.
Thanks.

474
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,199
God bless you, sir.
All right.

475
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,840
You are a good man.

476
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:12,159
He saved my life.
Yes, he did.

477
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:14,920
God bless him. Yeah. Come on.

478
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,639
God bless you.

479
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:34,000
I'm sorry, Herr Direktor,
but you're running very late.

480
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:37,199
This is for the
Obersturmbannfuehrer, sir.

481
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:40,039
And this is for his niece,
Greta. It's her birthday.

482
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:42,800
Greta as in Garbo. By the way,
don't ever do that to me again.

483
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,360
Go. Go, go, drive!
Don't bow.

484
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,199
Did you happen to notice that
that man had one arm? What? Did he?

485
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,239
What's his use?
Very useful.

486
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,400
How?
Very useful! Success!

487
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,519
#Achrar kach loe nedah #

488
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:31,199
Besen und Schaufeln
werden ausgeladen...

489
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,800
jeder nimmt sich eine und dann
wird die Strasse gereinigt.

490
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,000
We'll be late for work.

491
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,760
You shouldn't think of them
as yours, Oskar.

492
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,719
You need to understand that
some of the officers here...

493
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,400
don't give a damn
about production.

494
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,400
To them, it's a matter of,
um, national priority...

495
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,679
thatJews
be made to shovel snow.

496
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,199
It's got nothing to do
with reality, Oskar.

497
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:06,239
You know it and I know it.

498
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,519
Jews shoveling snow...

499
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:13,119
It's got a, um,
ritual significance.

500
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:18,000
Come with me.
I am an essential worker.

501
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,679
Essential worker?
Yes.

502
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:26,960
I work for Oskar Schindler.
Essential worker for Oskar Schindler.

503
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:30,360
A one-armed Jew? Twice
as useless! Yes, yes.

504
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,239
I lost a day
of production, Rolf.

505
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,360
I work for Oskar Schindler.

506
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,360
Danka, look at the snow. Look
at the snow. Look at the snow!

507
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,920
I lost a worker.
I expect to be compensated.

508
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,800
File a grievance with the
Economic Office. It's your right.

509
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,519
Would it do any good? Of course not.

510
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,100
A big shot from the SS Budget and
Construction Office came to lunch...

511
00:42:01,135 --> 00:42:04,920
and he told us that to believe
theJewish skilled worker had a place...

512
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,199
in Reich economics
was a treasonable idea.

513
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,159
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?

514
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:19,599
He was
a metal press operator.

515
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,159
Quite skilled.

516
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,000
Herr Direktor?

517
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,320
Shit.
I don't believe it.

518
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,519
Stern, is that you?

519
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:04,639
No, it's Poldek.
It's about Stern.

520
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:08,400
Leave your luggage
on the platform.

521
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,480
Clearly label it.

522
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:14,559
Given name first,
then your surname.

523
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:17,119
Do not bring
your baggage with you.

524
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:20,000
It will follow you later.

525
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:23,199
Leave your luggage
on the platform.

526
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,199
Clearly label it.

527
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,079
Lassen Sie Ihr Gepaeck
am Bahnsteig.

528
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,760
Stern?

529
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,800
He's on the list.
He is?

530
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,679
Well, let's find him. I'm
sorry. You can't have him.

531
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:42,559
He's on the list. If he were an essential
worker, he would not be on the list.

532
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:45,280
I'm talking to a clerk.
What is your name?

533
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,320
Sir, the list is correct. I
didn't ask you about the list.

534
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:52,320
I asked you your name.
Klaus Tauber.

535
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,559
Tauber.

536
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:58,360
Hauptscharfuehrer, this gentleman
thinks a mistake's been made.

537
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,800
My plant manager is
somewhere on this train.

538
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,880
If it leaves with him on it,
it'll disrupt production...

539
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,119
and the Armaments Board
will want to know why.

540
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:07,360
Achtung, dieser Zug
faehrt jetzt ab.

541
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,440
Is he on the list?
Yes, sir. Itzhak Stern.

542
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:16,880
Well, the list is correct,
sir. There is nothing I can do.

543
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,920
What is your name?
Close and secure all doors.

544
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,280
My name? My name is Kunder.
This train is now leaving.

545
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,639
Kunder.
Hauptscharfuehrer Kunder.

546
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:27,559
K- U-N-D-E-R.
And what's yours?

547
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:29,760
Schindler.
S- C-H-I-N-D-L-E-R.

548
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,079
Gentlemen,
thank you very much.

549
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:34,639
I think I can guarantee you
you'll both be in...

550
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:38,320
Southern Russia before the
end of the month. Good day.

Sir?

559
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,119
Stern!
Herr Direktor.

560
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,960
My apologies.

561
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,840
Stop the train! He's here! I apologize.

562
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,639
- Stop the train!
- Stop the train! Stop it!

563
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:33,320
Sign here.
Initial there.

564
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,320
Makes no difference to us, you
understand. This one, that one.

565
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,840
It's the inconvenience
to the list.

566
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,519
It's the paperwork. I somehow
left my work card at home.

567
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,199
I tried to explain them
it was a mistake, but...

568
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,239
I'm sorry, it was stupid! What
if I got here five minutes later?

569
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,920
Then where would I be?

570
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,920

"JEWISH TOWN"
KRAKOW GHETTO WINTER '42

574
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,239
I woke up from a dream
this morning.

575
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:47,440
I was broke and sharing a room
with 12 people I didn't know,

576
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:52,519
only to discover I was broke and sharing
a room with 12 people I didn't know.

577
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:55,920
You laugh about it?
I have to laugh.

578
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,800
You are living
behind walls.

579
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:03,440
The walls I can deal with. It's the
restrictions to my life I'm tired of.

580
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,519
Those walls keep them out.
That's all I care about.

581
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,199
I like it here. There's
a kind of, I don't know,

582
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,440
ancestral squalor
to it all.

583
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,679
You are a slave to these
people. No one envies us anymore.

584
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:15,760
I'm smart. Oh, yes, you're smart.

585
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,960
You're a real genius.
You had your chance.

586
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:22,559
Today, today I actually found
time to organize a thought.

587
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:25,320
I can't remember
the last time I did that.

588
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,239
When's the last time
we did this?

589
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,639
When's the last time
we stood around and talked?

590
00:48:29,719 --> 00:48:32,840
No one ordered me
onto a truck today.

591
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,119
No one took my business
away from me.

592
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:37,199
You don't really have
a business to take.

593
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:39,400
There's nowhere
down from here.

594
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,639
This is it.
This is the bottom.

595
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:45,320
The ghetto is... liberty.

596
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,440
This street divides the
ghetto just about in half.

597
00:48:54,519 --> 00:48:59,679
Right side, Ghetto A:
Civil employees,

598
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,559
industrial workers
and so on.

599
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:07,360
Left side, Ghetto B:
Surplus labor,

600
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,800
the elderly
and infirm mostly.

601
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,484
Which is where you'll
want to start, huh?

602

is where you'll want to start, huh?

The women on the other
side of the wire.

611
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,880
My place is where?
There, sir.

612
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:33,119
There? You call that a
villa? Yes, the villa.

613
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:35,440
Their synagogue, can you
see it? That's not a villa.

614
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:38,599
We're planning to turn it into
the camp stables. It's a house.

615
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:42,400
What's that over there?

616
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,119
Kindergarten.
Fifty-one.

617
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:49,559
And we have a dentist,
shoemaker, practical physicians.

618
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:55,119
There they are, sir.

619
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:58,119
Hmm.

620
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:02,480
One of you is, uh,
a very lucky girl.

621
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:06,159
There is an opening
for a job,

622
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:10,000
away from all this...
backbreaking work,

623
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,480
at my new villa.

624
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:17,960
Uh, which of you has...

625
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:20,719
domestic experience?

626
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:27,599
Ja, on second thought, I don't
really want someone else's maid.

627
00:50:27,639 --> 00:50:30,920
All those annoying habits
I have to undo.

628
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:38,280
I don't want
to give you my cold.

629
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,519
Uh, what's your name?

630
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:42,800
Helen Hirsch.
What?

631
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,719
Helen Hirsch.

632
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,880
What? I can't hear. Helen Hirsch.

633
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,559
Ja.
Take it all down!

634
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:09,000
To work!

635
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:13,320
Take it down!
It is not safe!

636
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,000
She says the foundation was poured
wrong. She's got to take it down.

637
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,079
I told her it's the barracks,
not the fucking Hotel Europa.

638
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:23,199
Fucking Jew bitch engineer.
You fucking bitch!

639
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,400
Herr Kommandant.
The entire foundation...

640
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,079
has to be torn down
and repoured.

641
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:33,480
If not, there will be
at least a subsidence...

642
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:36,039
at the southern end
of the barracks.

643
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:38,559
Subsidence,
and then collapse.

644
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:41,280
And you are an engineer? Yes.

645
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,719
My name is Diana Reiter.
I'm a graduate...

646
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,280
of Civil Engineering
from the University of Milan.

647
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:50,000
Ah, an educated Jew,
like Karl Marx himself.

648
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,599
Unterscharfuehrer!
Jawohl?

649
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:04,719
Shoot her.
What?

650
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,199
Herr Kommandant,
I'm only trying to do my job.

651
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,119
Ja, I'm doing mine.

652
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:13,199
But, sir, she's foreman of construction.

653
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,599
We are not going to have
arguments with these people.

654
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:17,519
Okay.

655
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:22,320
No. Shoot her here,
on my authority.

656
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,159
It will take
more than that.

657
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:38,320
I'm sure you're right.

658
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:48,840
Take it down, repour it,
rebuild it. Like she said.

659
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,360
We have more to see, but we
have only one more hour of light.

660
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:07,199
Today is history.

661
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,599
Today will be remembered.

662
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:16,320
Years from now, the young
will ask with wonder...

663
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,760
about this day.

664
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:23,599
Today is history,
and you are part of it.

665
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:26,599
Six hundred years ago...

666
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:33,000
When elsewhere they were footing the blame for
the Black Death, Kazimierz the Great, so-called,

667
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:36,159
#Ke laolam chasedo # told
theJews they could come to Krakow.

668
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:39,239
Chaja, bread.
They came.

669
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:42,480
Not that fat. No, less. They trundled
their belongings into the city.

670
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,400
Yes, a bit less.
They settled.

671
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:49,760
They took hold.
They prospered...

672
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:54,760
in business, science,
education, the arts.

673
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,440
They came here with nothing.

674
00:53:57,519 --> 00:53:59,639
Nothing.

675
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,360
And they flourished.

676
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:08,920
For six centuries
there has been a Jewish Krakow.

677
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,159
Think about that.

678
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:14,079
By this evening,

679
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:18,119
those six centuries
are a rumor.

680
00:54:18,199 --> 00:54:21,920
They never happened.

681
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,599
Today is history.

682
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:42,519
LIQUIDATION OF THE GHETTO
MARCH 13, 1943

683
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:47,519
Absitzen und in Zweierreihen
antreten!

684
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,440
Kameraden!
Schneller!

685
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:58,320
I think we will start...
with Ghetto B.

686
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,400
Hopp, hopp, hopp, hopp!

687
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:09,000
All right? Start from both sides?

688
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:11,079
I would like you to start
there. The right side?

689
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:13,679
The right side, yeah. And
then move around. Okay.

690
00:55:15,719 --> 00:55:19,960
Beschriften Sie es deutlich.
Es wird Ihnen nachgeschickt.

691
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,039
Lassen Sie
Ihr Gepaeck stehen.

692
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,800
Beschriften Sie es deutlich.

693
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:32,239
Es wird Ihnen nachgeschickt.

694
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,760
Aufmachen!
Lakoom.

695
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,960
Loe ani loe yodahat olay kaday lehachnese

Bohow.

697
00:55:44,519 --> 00:55:48,800
Hopp, hopp, hopp, hopp!

698
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,760
'Runterkommen!

699
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:27,599
'Rauskommen, Juden!

700
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,239
Ziehen Sie sich warm an!
Kommen Sie 'raus!

701
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:45,239
Na Platz!

702
00:56:53,719 --> 00:56:57,199
Gold, Chaim!
Platz Chodi.

703
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,320
Gold, Chaim!
Yes, Chaim Gold.

704
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,800
Shoot him.

705
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,880
Nie zabijaj!
Nie zabijaj!

706
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,039
Ziehen Sie warme Kleidung an
und begeben Sie sich zum Platz...

707
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:17,039
Keine Koffer!
Keine Koffer!

708
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:21,159
Gehen Sie durch!
Keine Koffer! Keine Koffer!

709
00:57:21,239 --> 00:57:23,920
Hey, little boy.
Wie alt bist du, huh?

710
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,719
Na, wie hiesst du?
Wie heisst du, huh?

711
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,280
Keine Koffer,

712
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,719
Packt keine Koffer!
Keine Koffer!

713
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,840
'Rueber zum Platz Chodi!
Koffer hierlassen!

714
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,760
Blauschein.
Platz Chodi!

715
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,000
Was soll
der Koffer hier?

716
00:57:41,079 --> 00:57:44,079
Alles 'rueber
zum Platz Chodi!

717
00:57:59,159 --> 00:58:00,880
We're getting out
through the sewers.

718
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,559
I have to check
if they're clear.

719
00:58:03,639 --> 00:58:06,599
Mila, pack some things. Nothing bigger
than this. I can't go in the sewers.

720
00:58:06,679 --> 00:58:09,760
I told you I won't go
in the sewers.

721
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:16,000
You can go.
Yes, you can.

722
00:58:18,039 --> 00:58:20,000
I won't go in the sewers.

723
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,679
Move! Over there!
Over there! Move!

724
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,920
Your card, Jew!

725
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,320
Deine Papiere,
Jude!

726
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,960
Deine Papiere, Jude!

727
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,840
That line.

728
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,159
Deine Karte!

729
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:50,840
Ich geh'nicht 'rauf
wegen Deiner verdammten Karte!

730
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,400
Deine Scheisskarte!

731
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,559
Was soll denn die Scheisse?
Bist du denn verrueckt geworden?

732
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:17,000
Mit diesem Scheissgewehr haettest
du mich erschiessen koennen!

733
00:59:17,079 --> 00:59:19,079
Du hast so nah an mir
vorbeigeschossen!

734
00:59:19,159 --> 00:59:21,519
Was heisst hier Entschuldigung.
Du bist wohl verrueckt geworden!

735
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:24,639
Zurueckbleiben!
Zurueckbleiben!

736
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,440
Nicht sprechen, nicht sprechen!
Einfach zu den Lastwagen gehen!

737
00:59:32,519 --> 00:59:35,000
Weiterlaufen! Weiterlaufen!
Nicht sprechen!

738
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,559
Komm her, du Judensau!

739
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:48,800
Bleib stehen, hab'ich gesagt.
Bleib stehen!

740
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,760
Chodzcie tu szybko!

741
01:00:44,119 --> 01:00:46,519
She's good as dead.
Leave her.

742
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:50,039
Give me a moment.
Just let me bring her inside.

743
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:58,880
You can join her...
or join the line.

744
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:05,719
Women to the left! Wilhelm! Rose!

745
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,559
Men to right.
Women to the left.

746
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:11,239
Women to the left. Let me
go! I won't leave my husband!

747
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:19,320
Women to the left, and men to
the right. Promise me, be safe.

748
01:01:21,159 --> 01:01:24,159
Your government
is in the wrong country!

749
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,960
Mama! Mama!

750
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:20,039
Mila!

751
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,440
Oh, God, Danka!

752
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:54,880
You have a Blauschein.
Blauschein doesn't matter anymore.

753
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,559
They are cleaning out the ghetto.
There's not enough room for you.

754
01:02:57,639 --> 01:03:01,159
What are you talking about? We tried it
before. There's more than enough room.

755
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:04,159
- I changed my mind!
- Mama!
