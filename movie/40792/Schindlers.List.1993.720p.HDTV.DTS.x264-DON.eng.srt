I don't know how I say this.

1230

I never could say it now--
I said to him,

''Why are you beating me ?''

1232
01:36:28,075 --> 01:36:31,625
He said, ''The reason
I beat you now...

1233

is because you ask
why I beat you.''

We were on the roof on Monday,
young Lisiek and I,

1242
01:37:04,808 --> 01:37:08,645
and we saw the Herr Kommandant
come out of the front door...

1243
01:37:08,645 --> 01:37:13,344
and down the steps by the patio
right there below us and--

1244
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:18,139
and there on the steps
he drew his gun and he...

1245
01:37:18,235 --> 01:37:21,016
shot a woman
who was passing by.

1246
01:37:22,455 --> 01:37:25,620
A woman carrying a bundle.
Through the throat.

1247

Just-- Just a woman
on her way somewhere,
you know.

1248
01:37:29,264 --> 01:37:33,005
She was no fatter
or thinner...

or slower or faster
than anyone else,

1250

and I couldn't guess
what had she done.

1251
01:37:43,650 --> 01:37:47,199
The more you see
of the Herr Kommandant,

1252
01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:51,994
the more you see
there is no set rules
that you can live by.

1253
01:37:51,994 --> 01:37:56,694
You can't say to yourself,
''If I follow these rules,
I will be safe.''

1254
01:38:00,147 --> 01:38:04,270
He won't shoot you
because he enjoys you
too much.

He enjoys you so much
he won't even let you

He shot the woman
from the steps...

nothing to him.
