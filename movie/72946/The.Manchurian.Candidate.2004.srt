01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,951
<i>of the noble tomato.</i>

1243
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:23,833
<i>What was happening was the tomato</i>
<i>was over-ripening in the process</i>

1244
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:25,758
<i>and it was losing its flavor.</i>

1245
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:29,350
<i>It's actually a very simple procedure</i>
<i>to deactivate the gene concerned.</i>

1246
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:32,791
<i>And the same thing</i>
<i>can be applied to ourselves.</i>

1247
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:33,989
<i>At a flick of a switch,</i>

1248
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:36,919
<i>we can adjust character,</i>

1249
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,758
<i>change personality.</i>

1250
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:41,349
<i>And of course, more importantly...</i>

1251
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:45,192
<i>... we can offset</i>
<i>the ravages of dementia</i>

1252
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:50,155
<i>by implanting memory or adjusting</i>
<i>the synaptic connections.</i>

1253
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:53,636
<i>We can free people</i>
<i>from the terrible burden</i>

1254
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,070
<i>of an emotionally</i>
<i>compromised past.</i>

1255
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:01,518
MARCO: Watch where you're going!
MAN 1: Sorry.

1256
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:02,755
Watch where you're going!

1257
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,791
Just back up! Just back up.

1258
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,072
Watch it. Watch it. Shut up.

1259
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:11,598
MAN 2:
Take it easy, sir.

1260
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:19,032
I called the Pentagon and they told me
he's on medical leave.

1261
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:22,949
Secret Service, they got him on a
couple of their watch and observe lists.

1262
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:28,349
I guess there's been some trouble with
this guy involving Congressman Shaw.

1263
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,794
Oh?

1264
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:37,070
JORDAN: Among the shareholders
in Manchurian Global,

1265
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,316
were they to ever publish a list,
which they won't,

1266
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:42,717
you would find former presidents,
deposed kings,

1267
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:45,309
trust fund terrorists,
fallen Communist dictators,

1268
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:48,956
ayatollahs, African warlords
and retired prime ministers.

1269
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:51,151
- See what I mean?
- I get it. They're big. They're huge.

1270
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,713
They're... They're...
They're gigantic.

1271
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,717
I can't touch them. I get it.
I don't want to.

1272
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:56,918
And you bring me rumors
and conjecture.

1273
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,951
I started with nightmares.
Rumors, conjectures,

1274
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,559
that's a giant leap forward.

1275
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,918
Nightmares that you've interpreted
using as primary resources

1276
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,235
A, your spotty memory,

1277
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,078
B, the Internet,

1278
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,556
sacred sanctuary of idiots and nutters.
That's how they're gonna look at this.

1279
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,990
And C, a crazy man's notebook,

1280
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,111
along with evidence you chewed
out of a man's back.

1281
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:17,356
All neatly stitched together
with a common thread

1282
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:21,473
of a supremely powerful,
well-connected private equity fund,

1283
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:23,272
who, if you ever get
anywhere near them,

1284
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:24,993
will plead ignorance
and be shocked.

1285
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:26,235
Shocked to learn

1286
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:28,874
what some of their subsidiary
partners are engaged in.

1287
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,957
I could give a rat's ass
about Manchurian Global, sir.

1288
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,673
I could give a rat's ass about them.

1289
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,117
That is not why I'm here.

1290
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:41,071
I looked you up too, senator.

1291
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,718
Oh?

1292
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:47,438
You were in the Army.

1293
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:48,789
JORDAN:
I was drafted.

1294
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,594
Didn't make much of a soldier,
I'm afraid. Let me see this.

1295
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,633
That's not what I saw in the record.
That's not what the record says, sir.

1296
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:57,308
And you know how it works.

1297
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:59,915
Wars are fought
one battle at a time.

1298
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:02,315
Battles, you win one bullet at a time.

1299
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:05,034
And I'd be lying to you if I said

1300
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:07,117
that I didn't factor in,
in a huge way,

1301
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:09,993
the fact that you have
a vested, personal,

1302
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,839
political and patriotic interest
in how all of this shakes out.

1303
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,837
I'd be lying to you.

1304
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:18,557
You're right, major.

1305
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,559
I do.

1306
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:22,998
RADIO NEWSCASTER:

ELLIE:
The man is insane, Tom.

1317
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,192
Full-blown schizophrenia.

1318
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:56,551
He's been stalking Raymond,
the FBI is all over this already.

1319
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,716
I've seen the files.

1320
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,669
- Have you seen them?
- All over what?

1321
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,918
Your bipolar war buddy
has been sharing his dreams

1322
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,712
with Senator Jordan.

1323
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,349
Hello, Raymond.

1324
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,315
Hello, senator.
How's Jocelyn?

1325
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:15,512
Have you fact-checked this
with anyone, Tom?

1326
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:18,394
- Raymond.
ELLIE: Hm?

1327
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:22,831
JORDAN:
Do you recognize this man?

1328
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:26,159
No.

1329
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,351
His name is Atticus Noyle.

1330
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,110
He's a South African scientist
and mercenary.

1331
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,788
Someone our CIA turned to

1332
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,037
for covert mind warfare
against the Soviets in Afghanistan.

1333
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:40,232
Someone who has sold
his technology and services

1334
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:43,079
to terrorists and rogue states.

1335
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,476
And what does he
have to do with me?

1336
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:50,149
Major Bennett Marco
claims that this man...

1337
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:51,595
...brainwashed you.

1338
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:53,313
In his dreams.

1339
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:56,076
Contrived to have you win
the Medal of Honor.

1340
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:59,956
And has you poised to be the first
privately owned and operated

1341
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:01,752
vice president of the United States.

1342
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:04,235
Sir, I've already spoken
with Ben Marco.

1343
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:06,954
Unfortunately, he's not a well man.

1344
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:08,388
He's delusional.

1345
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,158
Nevertheless,

1346
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:12,669
he's pulled from his mad hat

1347
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,950
some remarkably lucid connections

1348
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:17,720
between his dreams
of your exploits in Kuwait

1349
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,592
and this Dr. Noyle

1350
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,950
and the private equity fund
Manchurian Global,

1351
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:25,597
your mother's primary political
benefactor for the past 15 years.

1352
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,394
Oh, come on, Tom.
They contribute to half the Senate.

1353
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,158
Both sides of the aisle.

1354
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,509
What are you saying?

1355
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:35,988
At the time of Desert Storm,
Dr. Atticus Noyle

1356
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,714
was working under a research grant
from Manchurian Global,

1357
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:41,480
developing deep implant
behavior modification.

1358
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:43,318
Oh, my God.

1359
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,511
Rogue scientists, mind control,
Manchurian Global.

1360
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:46,675
- You.
- Tom.

1361
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,199
Connect the dots, Raymond.

1362
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:51,312
Where was your famous
Lost Patrol

1363
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,909
for those three missing days?

1364
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:57,430
Eluding capture in the desert?
Or somewhere else,

1365
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:00,632
being microwaved
by this Atticus Noyle?

1366
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:03,070
- Oh, Tom.
- I'm sorry, senator,

1367
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:06,192
but what exactly
are you suggesting I do?

1368
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,839
Bow out gracefully.

1369
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,553
Personal reasons,
an obscure illness.

1370
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,036
Yield your spot on the ticket
and go into seclusion.

1371
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:14,958
Oh, that's what this is about.

1372
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:17,355
And then surrender yourself
to federal authorities.

1373
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:19,152
Help them trace this thing
to its source

1374
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:22,079
and address whatever damage
may have been done to you.

1375
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:24,874
And I'll be waiting
for your press announcement

1376
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,274
first thing in the morning.

1377
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,038
- And then we'll talk.
- Tom.

1378
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:31,152
If there's any inkling of truth
in any of these charges,

1379
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,510
if anyone has ever harmed
a hair on his head,

1380
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:34,869
I will find out about it.

1381
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:36,718
You have 12 hours, senator.

1382
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:39,275
But if it's not true,

1383
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,755
I will see you impeached
on the floor of the Senate

1384
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:44,076
and bury you.

1385
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,473
Good night.

1386
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,951
It's preposterous.

1387
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,870
Idiotic story.

1388
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,950
Mother, there's something
I have to tell you.

1389
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:01,149
What?

1390
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:05,119
I've been having the dreams.

1391
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:08,549
Ben said there were tests
they could run to see if...

1392
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:11,115
No. Where are you going?

1393
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:12,914
Sergeant Shaw.

1394
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:14,553
