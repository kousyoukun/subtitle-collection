- I don't have dreams, captain.

Take it easy, sir.

1260
01:24:43,707 --> 01:24:46,835
I called the Pentagon and they told me
he's on medical leave.

1261
01:24:47,044 --> 01:24:50,923
Secret Service, they got him on a
couple of their watch and observe lists.

1262
01:24:52,841 --> 01:24:56,553
I guess there's been some trouble with
this guy involving Congressman Shaw.

1263
01:24:57,763 --> 01:24:59,098
Oh?

1264
01:25:02,101 --> 01:25:05,646
JORDAN: Among the shareholders
in Manchurian Global,

1265
01:25:05,854 --> 01:25:07,981
were they to ever publish a list,
which they won't,

1266
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:11,527
you would find former presidents,
deposed kings,

1267
01:25:11,735 --> 01:25:14,238
trust fund terrorists,
fallen Communist dictators,

1268
01:25:14,446 --> 01:25:18,033
ayatollahs, African warlords
and retired prime ministers.

1269
01:25:18,242 --> 01:25:20,327
- See what I mean?
- I get it. They're big. They're huge.

1270
01:25:20,536 --> 01:25:21,954
They're... They're...
They're gigantic.

1271
01:25:22,162 --> 01:25:24,039
I can't touch them. I get it.
I don't want to.

1272
01:25:24,707 --> 01:25:26,333
And you bring me rumors
and conjecture.

1273
01:25:26,542 --> 01:25:28,460
I started with nightmares.
Rumors, conjectures,

1274
01:25:28,669 --> 01:25:30,129
that's a giant leap forward.

1275
01:25:30,629 --> 01:25:33,632
Nightmares that you've interpreted
using as primary resources

1276
01:25:33,841 --> 01:25:35,009
A, your spotty memory,

1277
01:25:35,217 --> 01:25:36,927
B, the Internet,

1278
01:25:37,136 --> 01:25:40,556
sacred sanctuary of idiots and nutters.
That's how they're gonna look at this.

1279
01:25:40,764 --> 01:25:43,100
And C, a crazy man's notebook,

1280

along with evidence you chewed
out of a man's back.

1281
01:25:45,519 --> 01:25:47,646
All neatly stitched together
with a common thread

1282
01:25:47,855 --> 01:25:51,942
of a supremely powerful,
well-connected private equity fund,

1283
01:25:52,151 --> 01:25:53,819
who, if you ever get
anywhere near them,

1284
01:25:54,028 --> 01:25:55,612
will plead ignorance
and be shocked.

1285
01:25:55,821 --> 01:25:56,905
Shocked to learn

1286
01:25:57,114 --> 01:25:59,658
what some of their subsidiary
partners are engaged in.

1287
01:25:59,867 --> 01:26:01,827
I could give a rat's ass
about Manchurian Global, sir.

1288
01:26:02,036 --> 01:26:03,620
I could give a rat's ass about them.

1289
01:26:04,204 --> 01:26:06,165
That is not why I'm here.

1290
01:26:10,377 --> 01:26:12,379
I looked you up too, senator.

1291
01:26:14,548 --> 01:26:16,175
Oh?

1292
01:26:17,217 --> 01:26:19,011
You were in the Army.

1293
01:26:19,219 --> 01:26:20,429
JORDAN:
I was drafted.

1294
01:26:20,637 --> 01:26:23,349
Didn't make much of a soldier,
I'm afraid. Let me see this.

1295
01:26:23,557 --> 01:26:26,518
That's not what I saw in the record.
That's not what the record says, sir.

1296
01:26:26,727 --> 01:26:29,313
And you know how it works.

1297
01:26:29,730 --> 01:26:32,024
Wars are fought
one battle at a time.

1298

Battles, you win one bullet at a time.

1299

And I'd be lying to you if I said

1300
01:26:37,571 --> 01:26:39,531
that I didn't factor in,
in a huge way,

1301
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:42,534
the fact that you have
a vested, personal,

1302
01:26:42,743 --> 01:26:45,496
political and patriotic interest
in how all of this shakes out.

1303
01:26:45,704 --> 01:26:47,581
I'd be lying to you.

1304
01:26:49,583 --> 01:26:51,460
You're right, major.

1305
01:26:52,086 --> 01:26:53,545

Have you fact-checked this
with anyone, Tom?

- Raymond.
ELLIE: Hm?

No.

1329
01:28:02,156 --> 01:28:04,241
His name is Atticus Noyle.

1330
01:28:04,783 --> 01:28:07,119
He's a South African scientist
and mercenary.

1331
01:28:07,327 --> 01:28:09,913
Someone our CIA turned to

1332

for covert mind warfare
against the Soviets in Afghanistan.

1333
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:16,628
Someone who has sold
his technology and services

to terrorists and rogue states.

1335

And what does he
have to do with me?

1336

Major Bennett Marco
claims that this man...

1337
01:28:27,306 --> 01:28:28,474
...brainwashed you.

1338
01:28:28,682 --> 01:28:30,267
In his dreams.

01:28:31,018 --> 01:28:33,145
Contrived to have you win
the Medal of Honor.

Sir, I've already spoken

1343

Unfortunately, he's not a well man.

Nevertheless,

01:28:48,035 --> 01:28:50,454
he's pulled from his mad hat

1347
01:28:50,662 --> 01:28:52,831
some remarkably lucid connections

1348
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:55,709
between his dreams
of your exploits in Kuwait

1349
01:28:55,918 --> 01:28:57,670
and this Dr. Noyle

1350

and the private equity fund
Manchurian Global,

1351
01:29:00,673 --> 01:29:03,926
your mother's primary political
benefactor for the past 15 years.

What are you saying?

1355
01:29:10,808 --> 01:29:14,770
At the time of Desert Storm,
Dr. Atticus Noyle

1356
01:29:14,978 --> 01:29:17,606
was working under a research grant
from Manchurian Global,

1357
01:29:17,815 --> 01:29:20,484
developing deep implant
behavior modification.

1358
01:29:20,693 --> 01:29:22,403
Oh, my God.

1364
01:29:33,664 --> 01:29:37,126
Eluding capture in the desert?
Or somewhere else,

1365
01:29:37,334 --> 01:29:40,462
being microwaved
by this Atticus Noyle?

1366
01:29:40,671 --> 01:29:43,007
- Oh, Tom.
- I'm sorry, senator,

1367
01:29:43,215 --> 01:29:46,260
but what exactly
are you suggesting I do?

1368
01:29:47,469 --> 01:29:49,013
Bow out gracefully.

1369
01:29:49,221 --> 01:29:50,806
Personal reasons,
an obscure illness.

1370
01:29:51,265 --> 01:29:53,392
Yield your spot on the ticket
and go into seclusion.

1371
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,394
Oh, that's what this is about.

1372
01:29:55,602 --> 01:29:57,896
And then surrender yourself
to federal authorities.

1373
01:29:58,105 --> 01:29:59,773
Help them trace this thing
to its source

1374
01:29:59,982 --> 01:30:02,818
and address whatever damage
may have been done to you.

1375
01:30:03,027 --> 01:30:05,738
And I'll be waiting
for your press announcement

1376
01:30:05,946 --> 01:30:07,197
first thing in the morning.

1377
01:30:07,406 --> 01:30:09,033
- And then we'll talk.
- Tom.

1378
01:30:09,241 --> 01:30:12,286
If there's any inkling of truth
in any of these charges,

1379
01:30:12,494 --> 01:30:14,747
if anyone has ever harmed
a hair on his head,

1380
01:30:14,955 --> 01:30:16,165
I will find out about it.

1381
01:30:16,373 --> 01:30:18,083
You have 12 hours, senator.

1382
01:30:18,292 --> 01:30:20,753
But if it's not true,

1383
01:30:20,961 --> 01:30:23,339
I will see you impeached
on the floor of the Senate

1384
01:30:23,547 --> 01:30:25,758
and bury you.

1385

01:30:33,974 --> 01:30:36,060
