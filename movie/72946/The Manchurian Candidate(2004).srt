哦，来吧，伙计
Oh, come on, man, let's go.

12
00:01:53,145 --> 00:01:56,410
不，伙计，你姐还没把支票寄给我呢
No, man, your sister  didn't send me that check yet.

13
00:02:12,397 --> 00:02:15,264
不不，是这么玩的--  德克萨斯纸牌是这么玩的
No, this is how you play the-   This is how you play Texas Hold'em.

14
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:17,594
你刚刚告诉我们怎么玩法！
You just told us how to play it!

15
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:21,634
德克萨斯纸牌是这么玩的
This is how you play Texas Hold'em.

16
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:27,569
你再翻一张牌  这是他妈的第四张...
Will you flip another card.  This is the fourth fucking...

17
00:02:30,182 --> 00:02:33,049
  炸弹    你出什么牌，迈尔文？
  Four of a kind.    What do you got, Melvin?

18
00:02:35,254 --> 00:02:36,516
迈尔文，伙计，你想干嘛？
Yo, Melvin, man,  what you gonna do,

19
00:02:36,722 --> 00:02:38,986
你是打牌还是孵蛋啊？
you gonna play the cards  or you gonna hatch them?

20
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:43,287
我才不想孵蛋  我得马上跑去提点款
I ain't gonna hatch them. I need to  run out to the ATM real quick.

21
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:46,789
外边应该会有...
There's gotta be a...

22
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:49,024
会有一家7-11（超市）
Gotta be a 7-Eleven  out there somewhere.

23
00:02:53,305 --> 00:02:54,363
给我两张
Let me get two.

24
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:32,737
为什么我们不走直路
So why don't we just go directly in.

25
00:03:33,178 --> 00:03:35,271
顺着这条路，可以直奔目标
Right up this route, straight in.

26
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:39,173
哦，明白了，你就喜欢走荒无人烟的道
Yes, well, I see the captain  enjoys the road less traveled.

27
00:03:39,384 --> 00:03:41,511
不, 我只是不喜欢拉着队伍沿着大路...
No, the captain enjoys  not going down the highway,

28
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,850
成了任人宰割的对象
dragging his ass so every Tom, Dick  and Qaddafi can take a whack at it.

29
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:48,090
这里不太妙
It's very bad here.

30
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:51,691
这里，这儿也是
It's bad here, it's still bad here.

31
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:53,922
而且我听说，这儿也不太妙
And I've heard it's bad  right down here.

32
00:03:54,366 --> 00:03:56,300
  哪儿都不太妙，唔？    是啊
  Bad everywhere, huh?    Yeah.

33
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:57,559
有地雷？
Mines?

34
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,899
很难对付，都是瑞典货
Tricky. Swedish-made.

35
00:04:06,778 --> 00:04:09,804
没人跟我提到过地雷的事啊
The man didn't say anything  about mines to me.

36
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:12,516
肖中士
Sergeant Shaw.

37
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:20,024
-中士  -长官
  Sergeant.    Sir.

38
00:04:20,225 --> 00:04:22,489

39
00:04:22,694 --> 00:04:24,093
是，长官
Yes, sir.

40
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,329
你还好么？
You okay?

41
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:28,726
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

42
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:32,627
两分钟
Two minutes.

43
00:04:33,472 --> 00:04:35,963
伙计，给我两张牌
Yo, give me two cards, man.

44
00:04:56,928 --> 00:04:58,919
上尉叫我们准备行动
Captain says we're moving out.

45
00:04:59,631 --> 00:05:01,189
所以...
So...

46
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:09,863
嘿, 那屁小子需要个伴  还要人抱抱
Hey, that cat needs a friend.  And a hug.

47
00:05:10,876 --> 00:05:13,640
就在临近“沙漠风暴”行动的时候
It was just before Desert Storm.

48
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:17,246
我们在伊拉克控制的地区做例行侦察
We were on a routine recon  inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,

49
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:19,246
评估敌军实力
assessing enemy troop strength

50
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:23,785
因为萨达姆・侯赛因宣称  这将会是场无比激烈的战争
for what Saddam Hussein promised  would be the mother of all wars.

51
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:27,648
我和肖中士在领头车上
I'm in the lead vehicle  with Sergeant Shaw

52
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:31,056
还有我们的向导, 一个私人承包商
and our guide, a civilian contractor.

53
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,061
夜色清静，有星星，但没有月亮
The night is clear.  Stars, but no moon.

54
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:37,991
有埋伏！
Ambush!

55
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:43,374
坐稳了
Hang on.

56
00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:53,241
下车  听我指示！听我指示！
Exit the vehicle.  On me! On me!

57
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:55,017
照明弹,中士
Get a flare up, sergeant.

58
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:07,596
敌人逃跑了！追过去！追过去！  靠左！
Enemy dismount! Go after, go after!  Stay left!

59
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:09,266
掩护，掩护，掩护！
Covering, covering, covering!

60
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:10,935
靠右！
Bear right!

61
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:12,967
快，快，快！
Move it, move it, move it!

62
00:06:31,356 --> 00:06:32,846
马高上尉！
Captain Marco!

63
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:36,524
长官？
Sir?

64
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:39,054
你害怕了么？
Was you scared?

65
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:42,764
害怕？嗯...
Scared? Well...

66
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:46,394
根本没有时间让你害怕
...there was really no time  to be scared.

67
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:50,964
将个人生死置之度外
With complete disregard  for his own life,

68
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:54,805
雷蒙德・肖中士，单枪匹马
Sergeant Raymond Shaw  engaged single-handedly

69
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,280
与整整一个连的敌军交战
an entire company of the enemy.

70
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,421
肖中士被授予荣誉勋章
Sergeant Shaw was awarded  the Medal of Honor.

71
00:07:04,623 --> 00:07:07,114
推荐书是我亲手签名送呈的
I signed the recommendation myself.

72
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,121
先生，请说
Yes, sir.

73
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:12,228
你受伤了么？
Were you wounded?

74
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:13,625
是的，我受伤了
I was, I was injured.

75
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,464
脑震荡，失去知觉，肖中士接管了指挥权
Concussion, lost focus.  Sergeant Shaw, he took command.

76
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:19,102
少校？
Major?

77
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:22,997
  请说    你们部队有伤亡么？
  Yes.    Did your unit sustain any casualties?

78
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:27,508
有，一等兵爱德华德・英格拉姆

00:07:27,712 --> 00:07:31,910
一等兵罗伯特・贝克三世牺牲了

80
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:34,978
这荣誉勋章，国会荣誉勋章
Now, the Medal of Honor,  Congressional Medal of Honor,

81
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:38,814
是所有战士所向往的最高荣誉
is the highest award that any soldier  could aspire to.

82
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:41,754
今天我所谈到的那些勇士们的事迹
What these brave men  that I've talked about today did

83
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,451
应该永远不被世人遗忘
should never be forgotten.

84
00:07:44,663 --> 00:07:50,033
自1917年以来，在服役的  3000万名美军士兵中
Since 1 91 7, there have only been  970 Medals awarded,

85
00:07:50,235 --> 00:07:54,296
只颁发过970枚勋章
out of a total of 30 million  Americans at arms.

86
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:56,368
谁知道呢
Who knows.

87
00:07:56,575 --> 00:07:59,169
也许有一天  在你们这些优秀的青年中会有一个人
Maybe one day,  one of you fine young men

88
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:03,409
因为保卫我们伟大的祖国而被授予这勋章
will earn that medal  in defense of this great nation.

89
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,642
请说
Yes.

90
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:10,549
马高少校，我谨代表1094和1128部队
Major Marco,  on behalf of Troops 1 094 and 1 1 28,

00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:30,531
你曾希望那是你吗？
You ever wish it had been you?

97
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:33,109
对不起，你说什么？
I'm sorry, excuse me?

98
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:36,213
赢得勋章
Won the Medal.

99
00:08:37,282 --> 00:08:38,874
成为...成为英雄
Been-  Been the hero.

100
00:08:40,018 --> 00:08:43,681
那个，先生，我只是...  我只是对自己能亲身经历这一切感到骄傲
Well, sir, I'm just-   I'm just proud that I was there.

00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:12,914
  马高少校？    是
  Major Marco?    Yes.

104
00:09:14,953 --> 00:09:16,716
艾尔・迈尔文，长官
Al Melvin, sir.

105
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,486
迈尔文下士

106
00:09:22,694 --> 00:09:24,924
你的部下，“沙漠风暴”
From your unit, Desert Storm.

107
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:29,025
迈尔文下士，你好吗？
Corporal Melvin. How you doing?

108
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,902
我做了一些梦，长官
I have these dreams, sir.

109
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:36,704
  梦？    是的，长官
  Dreams?    Yes, sir.

110
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:41,442
科威特，你和我
Kuwait. It's you and me,

111
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:44,843
英格拉姆，贝克，还有...
Ingram and Baker and...

112
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:47,974
雷蒙德・肖
...Raymond Shaw.

113
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:50,916
哦
Okay.

114
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:55,050
瞧，我所记得的和你刚刚说的一样
See, I remember it happened  like you just said,

115
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,727
但然后...
and then...

116
00:09:57,696 --> 00:09:59,254
...我又记不清了
...I don't.

117
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:02,528
嗯...
Well...

118
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:04,599
我们在那儿打得很辛苦，迈尔文
...we had it pretty rough  over there, Melvin.

119
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:06,964
过去很久了，记忆是会有偏差
That was a long time ago.  Memories shift.

120
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:13,503
你有做梦吗，长官？
Do you have dreams, sir?

121
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:15,176
每个人都做梦，下士
Everybody has dreams, corporal.

122
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,109
不，不是那种
No, not these.

123
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:19,249
不，我没有
No, I don't.

124
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,712
我把它写了下来  你看，差不多，每天晚上
I write it all down.  You know, like, every night,

125
00:10:25,924 --> 00:10:30,418
每当我醒过来，我试着记下来
right when I wake up,  I try to get it down.

126
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:32,460
你知道，都是些零星片断
It doesn't always come together,  you know,

127
00:10:32,664 --> 00:10:33,995
我不能记得一清二楚
not everything that I can remember.

128
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,331
也许你应该去退伍军人医院
Maybe you should go  to the V.A. hospital,

129
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:39,662
找位医生谈谈
talk to one of the doctors.

130
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:42,032
  我已经找过了    哦，那好
  I've been to doctors, man.    Okay.

131
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:48,877
我只是...我只是...
I'm just... I'm just...

132
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:53,277
我只是有点想不通，长官
I'm just a little stuck, sir.

133
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:56,818
因为我记得，那个，肖...
Because I remember, okay, Shaw...

134
00:10:57,022 --> 00:11:00,150
肖，是的...  肖救了我们，对...
Shaw, okay...  Shaw saving us, right...

135
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:02,987
...但是那没道理啊，因为...
...but that doesn't make sense,  because...

136
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,294
应该是你才对
...that should've been you.

137
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:10,627
好吧，如果肖是在那辆悍马上...
Okay, if Shaw is in the Hummer...

138
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:13,128
...那辆丰田在这里...
...the Toyota is here...

139
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:16,068
好了，先起来，站起来
All right. Just get up, get up.

140
00:11:16,274 --> 00:11:17,764
听我说，这...
Listen, it's...

141
00:11:17,976 --> 00:11:21,969
这已经过去了，画上句号了  懂吗？你得向前看
That's over with. That's done.  Okay? You gotta move on.

142
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,080
我只是希望，你知道，也许--
What I was hoping is that,  you know, maybe--

143
00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:25,442
你缺钱花吗？
You need some money  or something?

144
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,810
  不，不，长官    等一下
  No, no, sir.    Wait a minute.

145
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:29,009
我不需要你的钱
I don't need your money, man.

146
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:31,849
那好吧，很高兴见到你
All right. It was great to see you.

147
00:11:55,013 --> 00:11:57,379
纸袋还是塑料袋，先生？
Paper or plastic, sir?

148
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:03,649
随着因血腥星期五的事件  而再度引发的公众的焦虑
With public anxiety being rekindled  by the events of Bloody Friday,

149
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:09,191
随着仍然前途未卜的反恐战迈入又一个年度
with the war on terror continuing into  yet another year, no end in sight,

150
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:12,158
忧虑仍在滋生蔓延
the worries just continue to grow.

151
00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:14,797
民意测验表明越来越多的选民
Polls indicate that  more and more voters

152
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:18,230
关注起个人家庭安全
are concerned with  personal family safety,

153
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:20,461
以及经济保障体制
with economic security,

154
00:12:20,672 --> 00:12:23,732
担忧越来越多的工职流向海外
fearing more and more jobs  going overseas

155
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:27,571
或者被非法移民占有
or being taken by  illegal immigrants.

156
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:31,840
选民关注空气和水的质量
They're concerned with the quality  of air and our water,

157
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,542
由于环保法律的倒退
the degradation caused by the  rollback in environmental regulations,

158
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:39,053
以及宗教和种族分化  导致空气和水源品质退化
by religious and racial polarization,

159
00:12:39,257 --> 00:12:43,853
并伴随着全球人口死亡骤增
with the drumbeat of body bags  coming from all over the globe.

160
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:47,395
美国人民已经为政党更替做好了准备
The American people are ready  for a new agenda.

161
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:52,434
然而由于本党在众多问题上都大有分歧
But because this party is so  divided on so many issues,

162
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:56,664
确定副总统候选人很可能会成为
the choice of a vice presidential  nominee may very well be

163
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:00,834
此次会议代表们协力齐心的要素
the unifying factor for delegates  at this convention.

164
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:03,840
如果大家因此能推举我
And if this respect propels me  toward the nomination

165
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:08,485
作为你们的副总统候选人，我将感到无比荣幸
as your vice presidential candidate,  I will be greatly honored.

166
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,553
我们需要向内看，先治理自己的家园
We need to look inward,  attend to our own house.

167
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,986
对我们国家的威胁并不仅仅  来自逍遥法外的恐怖分子
The danger to our country is not only  from some terrorists at large,

168
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:21,029
那些恐怖分子，顺便提一句  是我们帮忙造成的
terrorists who, by the way,  we've helped engender

169
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:24,199
是20年失败的对外政策的恶果
with 20 years  of failed foreign policy.

170
00:13:24,402 --> 00:13:29,203
不，真正的威胁来自被剥夺的公民自由
No, the real danger  is from suspending civil liberties,

171
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:32,109
摈弃“权利和自由法案”  放任我们的恐惧...
gutting the Bill of Rights,  allowing our fear

172
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,608
去摧毁我们民主的理念
to destroy our democratic ideals,

173
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:38,749
因为一旦我们开始  自我颠覆我们宪法的保障
because once we start overturning  our constitutional protections,

174
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,474
我们的敌人就已经赢了
our enemies have won.

175
00:13:43,888 --> 00:13:45,515
雷蒙德？
Raymond?

176
00:13:45,723 --> 00:13:47,623
  他在这儿    亲爱的
  There he is.    Darling.

177
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:51,489
怎么，你打算让我站在那儿  像个服务生似的吗？
What, were you gonna make me  stand out there like room service?

178
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,837
我问了楼下的弗里曼小姐，你的女保镖  得力助手弗里曼小姐
I asked downstairs and Miss Freeman,  your wrangler, helpful Miss Freeman,

179
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:03,940
她说你在这儿练习演讲
she said you were up here  practicing your speech.

180
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:06,235
说真的我不明白为什么
I don't honestly understand why

181
00:14:06,444 --> 00:14:09,208
你非要孤立自己，雷蒙德
you insist upon  isolating yourself, Raymond.

182
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:11,541
大家都崇拜你，他们渴望与你作伴
People adore you,  they crave your company,

183
00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:13,182
可你却在这里
and yet here you are,

184
00:14:13,384 --> 00:14:15,716
躲藏起来就像是个...
holed up as if you were some sort of

185
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,583
感情有问题的人，像你父亲似的
emotionally challenged individual  like your father.

186
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:24,524
闭嘴，汤姆  而不是雷蒙德・普兰蒂斯・肖
Shut up, Tom.  Instead of Raymond Prentiss Shaw,

187
00:14:25,096 --> 00:14:27,394
英俊，聪明
handsome, intelligent,

188
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:30,625
人们爱戴的战争英雄，本党的擎天柱石
people-loving war hero  with a great deal to offer his party.

189
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:33,065
  不    也是本国的
  No.    And his country.

190
00:14:33,271 --> 00:14:34,363
不
No.

191
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:36,301
  不什么？    不
  No, what?    No.

192
00:14:36,507 --> 00:14:38,031
我都还没问呢
I haven't even asked you  a question yet.

193
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:40,006
不--对于你那些将要问的问题
No to the question  you're going to ask.

194
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:42,270
不--对于你那些只是  装个样子问一下的问题
No to all of the questions  you pretend to want to ask.

195
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,606
你的头发太无精打采了
Your hair is too flat.

196
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:45,715
不--还有你不可以使你那些惯用的伎俩
And no, you may not engage  in your usual backdoor

197
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:46,884
还有那条领带...
And that tie...

198
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:49,610
把我推上总统候选人的位置
political thuggery to shovel me  onto the presidential ticket.

199
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:53,048
领带不对，要用再休闲些的
Tie's wrong. Something less busy.

200
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:56,853
哦，你对当候选人不感兴趣
Oh, you're not interested.

201
00:14:57,061 --> 00:15:00,030
我当然感兴趣  否则我就不会在这里了
Of course I'm interested.  I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

202
00:15:00,231 --> 00:15:02,563
但这不意味着
But not if it means attacking  the reputation

203
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:04,428
攻击一个像汤姆・乔丹  那样的政治家的声誉
of a statesman like Tom Jordan,

204
00:15:04,636 --> 00:15:07,104
我肯定这是你计划的一部分
which I am sure  was part of your plan.

205
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:13,073
对不起，我什么时候攻击过  乔丹参议员了，尽管--
Excuse me, when have I ever  attacked Senator Jordan, despite--

206
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:15,003
尽管什么？
Despite what?

207
00:15:16,114 --> 00:15:18,105
尽管他女儿那年夏天在海滨
Despite the shameful way  his daughter toyed with you

208
00:15:18,316 --> 00:15:20,546
那么厚颜无耻地玩弄你
that summer at the shore.

209
00:15:22,553 --> 00:15:24,953
你把她赶走了，妈妈  我们可得实事求是--
You chased her away, Mother,  let's not have any illusions about--

210
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:27,556
她和你不是一类人  但如果你非要说是这么回事...
She wasn't in your league, but if that's  the way you choose to remember it...

211
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,954
你毁了我们所有的在一起的可能--
You destroyed any possibility  of us ever--

212
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:33,619
亲爱的，你把事情想得  过于单纯了点，但没关系
Honey, you are oversimplifying things  a little bit, but it's okay.

213
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:36,059
我会置身事外的
I'll stay out of it.

214
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:38,597
我保证
You have my word.

215
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:44,230
谢谢，谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

216
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:49,675
我想你们都知道我的母亲  埃莉诺・普兰蒂斯・肖参议员
I think you all know my mother,  Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw.

217
00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:55,309
而你们中的一些人，毫无疑问  还记得我的父亲
And some of you, no doubt,  remember my father,

218
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,512
已故的约翰・肖参议员
the late Senator John Shaw.

219
00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:05,053
我很荣幸能在国会任职两期
I've been honored to serve  my two terms in Congress.

220
00:16:05,263 --> 00:16:07,390
但我也是在权位高处长大的
But I also grew up on the Hill.

221
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:10,795
我知道职业政客是怎么玩这个游戏的
I've seen how the game is played  by professionals,

222
00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:12,765
政治交易是如何互惠互利的
how deals are struck,

223
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:16,270
委员会受恫吓，议案被买卖
committees bullied,  agendas bought and sold.

224
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:20,376
借此向我的母亲道声歉  我希望继续当个外行人
And with apologies to my mother,  I wish to remain an amateur.

225
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,383
我坚信民主政治是不容妥协的
I believe democracy  is not negotiable.

226
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:33,647
我坚信消除全世界和本国的恐惧并重获自由
I believe that freedom from fear  in the world at large and here at home

227
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:36,190
是不容妥协的
is not negotiable.

228
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:43,266
我知道如今等待着美国人的有多少恐惧
I know how much Americans  have to fear today.

229
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:45,993
但我可以告诉你们，我曾经体验过
But I can tell you  that I've been there.

230
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:50,001
我曾在前线和敌人直接交战
I've faced the enemy firsthand  on the battlefront.

231
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:53,409
我知道恐惧是什么滋味
I know what it is to be afraid.

232
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:57,645
但我就是活生生的证明，我们可以获胜
But I am living proof  that we can win.

233
00:16:58,383 --> 00:17:00,851
我们能战胜一切
We can prevail.

234
00:17:02,353 --> 00:17:08,349
我们必须把明天掌握在今天手中，谢谢
We must secure tomorrow today.  Thank you.

235
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,031
  讹诈？    也没什么直接证据
  Bluffing?    That was the inference.

236
00:17:17,235 --> 00:17:19,362
他们应该对我下跪谢恩
They should be down on their fat,  white knees, thanking me

237
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,868
感谢我解本党于倒悬
for saving this party from  committing political seppuku.

238
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:24,405
你对他们已经仁至义尽了，参议员
You gave them every opportunity  to do the right thing, senator.

239
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:28,010
不，我给他们的仁义只有一个  这对我来说已经是法外施恩了
No. I gave them one opportunity and  that was unusually generous of me.

240
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:29,937
看看你能不能联络一下鲍勃・阿瑟
See if you can get ahold of  Bob Arthur,

241
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:31,809
我想要见他
because I'm gonna wanna  meet with him.

242
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:33,574
非常感谢你的安排
Thank you very much  for arranging this.

243
00:17:33,785 --> 00:17:35,548
  我很感谢    不客气
  I appreciate it.    Sure.

244
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:39,383
  部长先生    参议员
  Mr. Secretary.    Senator.

245
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,649
非常感谢你参加这次会议
Thank you very much  for taking this meeting.

246
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:45,192
  很高兴再见到你    利昂娜，很高兴见到你，利昂娜
  Good to see you again.    Leona. So nice to see you, Leona.

247
00:17:45,396 --> 00:17:47,956
伙计们，先生们
Buddy. Gentlemen.

248
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:51,228
不，我以为今早我们已经谈妥了
No, I thought we settled it  this morning.

249
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:53,301
好，我会和你通气的
All right, I'll keep you posted.

250
00:17:57,508 --> 00:17:59,476
这是最后的决定了
The decision is final.

251
00:17:59,677 --> 00:18:01,804
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

252
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:05,409
  珍宁怎么样？    参议员
  How's Jeanine?    Senator.

253
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:08,985
汤姆・乔丹是公认的候选人
Tom Jordan's on the ticket.

254
00:18:09,187 --> 00:18:11,655
现在，我们并不需要你的支持
Now, we don't need your blessing,

255
00:18:11,856 --> 00:18:12,914
但我们会很欢迎你的支持的
but we'd like it.

256
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,120
好吧，在正题之前，我...
Okay, so before we get started,  I'm just--

257
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:20,791
很想知道...
I'm dying to know...

258
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:27,465
是哪个天才，搞出了那段  内布拉斯加州的新闻专访？
...which genius hatched the idea of  pairing a sound bite from Nebraska

259
00:18:27,672 --> 00:18:31,108
说什么让人肉炸弹远离公交车
with a relic who thinks that keeping  suicide bombers off our buses

260
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:34,369
是违反宪法的  是你吗，高蒂？
is unconstitutional.  Was it you, Gordy?

261
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:38,038
所有调查表明阿瑟-乔丹组合
All the research indicates  that an Arthur-Jordan ticket

262
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:39,739
很受美国民众的欢迎
sits quite well  with the American people.

263
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:42,476
“很受欢迎”能换算成多少票数？
"Sits quite well"  translates into how many votes?

264
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:44,951
你儿子在纽约外很多地方都不为人所知
Your son is largely unknown  outside of New York.

265
00:18:45,223 --> 00:18:48,681
我是说他的公共服务，国会纪录
I mean, his public service,  his congressional record,

266
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:50,588
尽管值得赞扬，但还不足以--
while commendable,  is not the kind of thing--

267
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:51,762
我的儿子是位战斗英雄
My son is a war hero.

268
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:54,830
阿瑟州长已经同意考虑
Governor Arthur has agreed  to consider Raymond

269
00:18:55,032 --> 00:18:56,829
让雷蒙德・阿瑟入组内阁
for a cabinet-level post.

270
00:18:57,034 --> 00:18:58,524
我们不是来这儿讨论的
We didn't come here  to have a discussion.

271
00:18:58,736 --> 00:19:00,101
我们是来这里讨论的吗？
Did we come here  to have a discussion?

272
00:19:00,304 --> 00:19:03,296
埃莉，你没有足够票数来阻止这事
Ellie, you don't have the votes  to block this.

273
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:05,942
甚至不能发起第二轮提名投票
Not even to push the nomination  to a second ballot.

274
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:08,510
哦，吉姆，就算他的竞选对手是个
Oh, Jim, even running against  this cut-and-fold vice president,

275
00:19:08,713 --> 00:19:12,672
内政外交都极度失败的对立党副总统
with his party's record of  abysmal failure at home and abroad,

276
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:16,684
阿瑟州长也还是没法登上总统宝座...
Governor Arthur is still unelectable  to the presidency...

277
00:19:16,888 --> 00:19:18,219
...如果没人助他一臂之力的话
...without help.

278
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:21,687
想想看，我们无畏的阿瑟
Consider, that our intrepid Arthur

279
00:19:22,193 --> 00:19:24,684
可以坚守住自己家乡，和东北部的票源
can hold on to his own home ground,  and the Northeast,

280
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:27,956
甚至加利福尼亚，我们在南部仍一无所有
and even California,  we are still dead across the South.

281
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,963
在南部他并不完全没有支持，参议员...
He's not dead completely  in the South, senator...

282
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:32,796
还有西南部，他们占有压倒性的优势
And the Southwest,  where they win by landslides.

283
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:34,130
我的意思是，这些你们都明白
I mean, you know this.

284
00:19:34,338 --> 00:19:36,738
你们的观察小组，你们的民意测试  都告诉你们这些
Your focus groups,  your polls all tell you this.

285
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:38,340
它们支持了我所说的，是吧？
They back me up, right?

286
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:41,103
现在，你们指望汤姆・乔丹帮你们
Now, you're counting on  Tom Jordan to help you get

287
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:43,212
得到黑人，妇女和大学生的选票
the black vote, women  and college kids.

288
00:19:43,414 --> 00:19:45,644
我的直觉告诉我他不会的
My gut instinct says he won't,

289
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:51,152
并且指望阿瑟能拉到中部的选票  那儿正是他最弱的地方
and on Arthur to somehow hold  the center, where he is soft at best.

290
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:53,915
我们确信这已经稳操胜券了，埃莉
We're confident  this is a winning ticket, Ellie.

291
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,616
多少误差幅度，沃恩？
What's your margin of error, Vaughn?

292
00:19:56,827 --> 00:19:58,522
五个百分点？
Five points?

293
00:19:58,729 --> 00:20:00,287
三个百分点？
Three?

294
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:02,591
我可以让它化为乌有，你们也知道的
I can swing that, and you know it.

295
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,268
哦，我可以拉走百分之七的票
Oh, I could swing seven  away from you.

296
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:07,061
这足以影响选举结果了
That's more than enough  to split the ticket.

297
00:20:07,271 --> 00:20:10,138
然后又是四年我们被白宫拒之门外？不
And deny us the White House  another four years? No.

298
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:11,467
不，就算你也不能
No, not even you.

299
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:14,042
就算你也不能，参议员  你这是在虚言恫吓
Not even you, senator,  will do that, you are bluffing.

300
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:16,372
哦，不不不，我说得出就做得到
Oh, no, no, no, senator,  I would and I will

301
00:20:16,581 --> 00:20:20,278
而且我会不择手段地捍卫美国
and I will do whatever is necessary  to protect America

302
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:23,146
不让任何敌对者有可乘之机
from anyone who opposes her.

303
00:20:23,354 --> 00:20:26,187
我不能...  难道我是这房间里唯一一个
I can't...  Am I the only person in this room

304
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,119
读过国家安全局报告的人吗？
who's been reading  these NSA reports?

305
00:20:28,326 --> 00:20:30,658
  我读过    那好，那你该知道
  I've read them.    All right, then you know,

306
00:20:30,861 --> 00:20:33,955
我们正处于另一次大灾难的边缘
you know we are on the brink  of another cataclysm,

307
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:36,190
也许是核袭击，就在我们本土
probably nuclear, on our own soil.

308
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,628
哦，埃莉，这也太极端了点
Oh, Ellie, that's a bit extreme.

309
00:20:37,835 --> 00:20:39,530
而且危机并非来自捉摸不定的恐怖分子
And it's not from random terrorists,

310
00:20:39,737 --> 00:20:42,069
而是来自对我们心怀不满的国家  组成的秘密联盟
but from covert alliances  of disaffected nations

311
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:46,437
因为有乔丹之流相信人性本善  的全球一体化论者存在
who have all been made bold  by this kind of Jordan one-worlder

312
00:20:46,644 --> 00:20:49,112
这些国家越发肆无惮忌
who believes that human beings  are essentially good

313
00:20:49,313 --> 00:20:51,144
乔丹之流还认为我们的强势  我不知道怎么说--
and that our power is somehow,  I don't know,

314
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:54,011
是可耻或邪恶的，从来不应该加以利用
shameful or evil or never to be used.

315
00:20:54,218 --> 00:20:56,812
毫无疑问，美国人民正在担惊受怕
Make no mistake,  the American people are terrified.

316
00:20:57,021 --> 00:20:59,421
他们知道什么事要发生了  他们可以感觉到
They know something's coming.  They can feel it.

317
00:21:00,324 --> 00:21:03,816
而我们可以继续愚弄哄骗他们
And we can either shovel them  the same old shit and call it sugar

318
00:21:04,028 --> 00:21:06,223
或者我们可以把他们武装起来
or we can arm them.

319
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,695
我们可以用一个年轻有活力  的副总统来武装他们
We can arm them with a young,  vibrant vice president.

320
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,358
我们可以给他们热情、能量  给他们一位真心诚意的战斗英雄
We can give them heat, energy,  give them a war hero with heart,

321
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:16,904
在国人性命安危未定的时候
forged by enemy fire  in the desert in the dark,

322
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:20,271
在暗夜荒漠中经过战火洗礼的战争英雄
when American lives  hung in the balance.

323
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:40,360
给我们几分钟
Give us a few minutes.

324
00:21:41,832 --> 00:21:43,857
谢谢
Thank you.

325
00:21:44,068 --> 00:21:46,332
部长先生，谢谢你的光临
Mr. Secretary,  thank you for your time.

326
00:21:46,804 --> 00:21:49,170
  谢谢    衷心感谢
  Thank you.    Really appreciate it.

327
00:21:50,408 --> 00:21:53,536
  利昂娜，晚上好    谢谢，埃莉
  Leona, good evening.    Thank you, Ellie.

328
00:21:54,445 --> 00:21:56,709
啊，他们需要自己做决定
Well, they're gonna have to make  their own decisions.

329
00:21:56,914 --> 00:21:59,781
我很荣幸地...
I am proud...

330
00:22:00,384 --> 00:22:02,909
宣布下届的...
...to offer into nomination

331
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,956
美国副总统提名候选人的名字是：
the name of the next vice president  of these United States:

332
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,652
雷蒙德・肖！
Raymond Shaw!

333
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:14,626
一个惊人的事态发展  24小时前...
A remarkable development.  Twenty-four hours ago,

334
00:22:14,832 --> 00:22:16,527
纽约国会议员雷蒙德・普兰蒂斯・肖
New York Congressman  Raymond Prentiss Shaw

335
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:18,599
甚至没有被提名为...
wasn't even being mentioned  as a possible candidate

336
00:22:18,803 --> 00:22:21,567
四年之后下届选举的副总统候选人
for the vice presidential nomination  four years from now,

337
00:22:21,772 --> 00:22:23,831
更别说被提上本次大会的议程
much less this current convention.

338
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:27,033
今晚大会中爆出令人难以置信的消息
Some incredible news  from the convention floor tonight.

339
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:28,973
就像是在肯塔基州马赛的决赛冲刺中
Like a long shot  catching the favorite

340
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,045
突然跑出了一匹黑马
on the back stretch  of the Kentucky Derby,

341
00:22:31,248 --> 00:22:33,808
雷蒙德・肖击败了  托马斯・乔丹参议员
Raymond Shaw has overtaken  Senator Thomas Jordan

342
00:22:34,018 --> 00:22:36,885
获得了副总统候选提名
to gain the vice presidential  nomination.

343
00:22:37,088 --> 00:22:41,252
雷蒙德・肖承继了传奇性的  普兰蒂斯家族王朝的血统
Raymond Shaw bears the lineage  of the fabled Prentiss family dynasty.

344
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:46,028
是传奇实业家兼外交官  泰勒・普兰蒂斯的孙子
Grandson of legendary industrialist  and diplomat Tyler Prentiss,

345
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,461
颇受争议的爱莉诺・普兰蒂斯・肖议员的儿子
son of controversial  Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw,

346
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:52,033
他母亲接替了丈夫
who took over the seat  vacated by her husband,

347
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:53,498
那位受人尊敬的约翰・肖参议员  空下来的席位
the esteemed John Shaw,

348
00:22:53,704 --> 00:22:57,401
他于20年前不幸去世
when he died tragically  over 20 years ago.

349
00:22:58,242 --> 00:23:01,268
对很多人来说  雷蒙德・普兰蒂斯・肖是个谜
For many, Raymond Prentiss Shaw  is an enigma.

350
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,379
身价百万的哈佛模范学生
The millionaire  Harvard honors student

351
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:05,173
入伍参加了步兵
who enlisted in the infantry,

352
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:08,978
拒绝了军官头衔的任命
refusing the officer's commission  to which he was entitled.

353
00:23:09,186 --> 00:23:10,915
不喜媒体且深居简出
Media-shy and reclusive,

354
00:23:11,122 --> 00:23:13,056
雷蒙德・肖的生活
Raymond Shaw's life  was forever changed

355
00:23:13,257 --> 00:23:14,918
在科威特沙场上被永远改变了
on the killing fields of Kuwait,

356
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:19,085
他由于作战英勇而被授予国会荣誉勋章
where he won the Congressional  Medal of Honor for combat bravery.

357
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:22,493
在闻名遐尔的肖中士的  “失踪巡逻队”中有两名士兵
Two members of Sergeant Shaw's  famed "Lost Patrol, "

358
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,134
一等兵爱德华德・英格拉姆
PFC Edward Ingram

359
00:23:25,336 --> 00:23:28,430
和一等兵罗伯特・贝克三世牺牲了
and PFC Robert Baker III,  were killed.

360
00:23:28,639 --> 00:23:32,097
他们的向导，私人承包商在伏击中失踪
Their guide, a civilian contractor,  disappeared in the ambush.

361
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:36,637
但是肖中士英勇地击退了敌人
But Sergeant Shaw  heroically fought off the enemy

362
00:23:36,847 --> 00:23:39,042
然后引领惊魂未定的  “失踪巡逻队”的幸存者
and guided the shell-shocked  survivors of the Lost Patrol

363
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,946
穿越敌占区抵达安全地带
across hostile terrain to safety.

364
00:23:42,153 --> 00:23:46,249
雷蒙德・肖也许是我所认识的最和善  最勇敢，最热心
Raymond Shaw is probably  the kindest, bravest, warmest--

365
00:23:46,457 --> 00:23:48,357
最无私的人了
Most selfless human being  I've ever known.

366
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,958
这位著名的战争英雄
The celebrated war hero,

367
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:53,927
在“沙漠风暴”后献身于公共事业
who dedicated himself to  public service after Desert Storm.

368
00:23:54,131 --> 00:23:58,033
这位荣誉勋章的获得者  “失踪巡逻队”成员们所爱戴的人
The Medal of Honor winner, beloved  by the men of the Lost Patrol.

369
00:23:58,402 --> 00:24:00,393
他很快在他的第二故乡纽约州
He quickly turned his energies  to public service

370
00:24:00,604 --> 00:24:02,435
将精力转向公共事业
in his adopted state of New York.

371
00:24:02,706 --> 00:24:05,231
--革命性的生物遗传技术

372
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:08,310

  马高上尉！    雷蒙德・肖是我所认识的

Raymond Shaw is probably  the kindest, bravest, warmest...

380
00:24:34,538 --> 00:24:37,974
还得注意大脑前额叶的复杂性
Yet note the complexity  of the frontal lobe.

381
00:24:38,175 --> 00:24:40,507
尽管如此...

00:25:17,414 --> 00:25:20,008
最无私的人了
warmest, most selfless  human being I've ever known.

394
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:42,899
没别的意思，少校
No offense, major...

395
00:25:43,941 --> 00:25:46,842
但是我们老让人管着，这真让人不舒服
... but it sort of chaps my ass  that we have to have a babysitter.

396
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:48,909
我过来就是想确实一下  你们没被哪个空军上将的闺房怨妇...
I'm just here to make sure  you don't get cornered

397
00:25:49,113 --> 00:25:50,910
缠得无法脱身
by some Air Force general's  unhappy wife.

398
00:25:51,815 --> 00:25:54,181
马高少校，看来我们还算走运
Major Marco,  we should be so lucky.

399
00:25:54,418 --> 00:25:55,851
  很高兴见到你    谢谢
  So nice to meet you.    Thank you.

400
00:25:56,053 --> 00:25:58,385
  谢谢    见到你很高兴
  Thank you.    Nice to meet you.

401
00:25:58,589 --> 00:25:59,886
雷蒙德・肖
Raymond Shaw.

402
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,819
马高少校，我们的二人巡逻队
Major Marco, this army of two

403
00:26:02,026 --> 00:26:03,994
准备去侦察一下那边的自助吧台了
are gonna do some recon  at the no-host bar.

404
00:26:04,194 --> 00:26:06,958
--这种只会助长敌人气焰的失败的对外政策
--a failed foreign policy which has  only served to galvanize our enemies.

405
00:26:07,531 --> 00:26:09,123
请借过
Excuse me, please.

406
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,893
事实上，调动一个不满份子  组成的杂牌军队...
In fact, mobilizing an ersatz  army of malcontents...

407
00:26:12,102 --> 00:26:15,560
  斯隆将军，你全权负责    没问题
  General Sloan, you lead the charge.    Absolutely.

408
00:26:15,773 --> 00:26:17,832
威廉姆，嗨，你怎么样？
William. Hi, how are you?

409
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:20,704
还挺好  你见过我的妻子了吗，帕姆？
All right, good.  Have you met my wife, Pam?

410
00:26:20,911 --> 00:26:23,812
  你好，最近怎样？    你好，鲍勃・阿瑟
  Hello, how are you?    Hello, Bob Arthur.

411
00:26:24,148 --> 00:26:28,414
我是说，这不应该是我们的邦国要旨吗?
I mean, isn't that supposed to be  the point of this great country of ours,

412
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:30,416
人人都很重要
that everybody matters.

413
00:26:30,621 --> 00:26:33,454
不只是列席此次宴会的人士
Not just the people at this party.

414
00:26:36,393 --> 00:26:40,420
也许那些没资格来这里的人  反倒更为重要
But perhaps more importantly,  those who can't afford to be here.

415
00:26:40,631 --> 00:26:43,327
  雷蒙德，抱歉打断一下    抱歉    失陪了
  Raymond. Sorry to interrupt.    Excuse me.

416
00:26:43,634 --> 00:26:45,659
  鲍勃，你认识我女儿吧    汤姆，我不敢相信
  Bob. You know my daughter.    Tom, I can't believe it.

417
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:49,396
当然认识了  乔斯林，很高兴再次见到你
Of course.  Jocelyn, good to see you again.

418
00:26:50,374 --> 00:26:52,535
  马克    埃莉诺
  Mark.    Eleanor.

419
00:26:52,743 --> 00:26:56,406
雷蒙德，你祖父一定会非常为你骄傲的
Raymond, your granddad would be  so goddamn proud of you.

420
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:57,979
谢谢， 怀特宁先生
Thank you, Mr. Whiting.

421
00:26:58,215 --> 00:27:00,911
雷蒙德, 这位是J.B.约翰斯顿  来自满洲国际集团
Raymond, this is J.B. Johnston,  from Manchurian Global.

422
00:27:01,118 --> 00:27:02,176
  嗨，你怎么样？    幸会
  Hi. How are you?    Pleasure.

423
00:27:02,386 --> 00:27:03,944
还有大卫・多诺万  他们的常务董事
And David Donovan,  their managing director.

424
00:27:04,154 --> 00:27:06,520
同时也是美国国际政治核心会议的联合主席
And co-chair of  the U.S. International Policy Caucus.

425
00:27:06,724 --> 00:27:07,850
您忠实的支持者，国会议员
Strong supporters, congressman.

426
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:10,724
他们迫切地要为你效力，亲爱的
They're desperate to be  of service to you, darling.

427
00:27:10,928 --> 00:27:12,759
谢谢，妈妈  我想你赚到酬金了
Thank you, Mother,  I think you've earned your fee.

428
00:27:12,963 --> 00:27:15,659
哦，没有的事，我勇敢的理想主义者
Oh, no. My plucky idealist.

429
00:27:16,734 --> 00:27:18,861
那么，先生们，生意如何？
So, gentlemen, how's business?

430
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:21,060
不太坏， 雷蒙德，生意还不坏
Not bad, Raymond.  Business is not bad.

431
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:22,636
总是可以更上一层楼的
It could always be better.

432
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,205
再好一点的话，你们的资产...
Any better and you guys  are gonna have

433
00:27:24,408 --> 00:27:25,841
就会超过欧盟了
more assets than  the European Union.

434
00:27:26,043 --> 00:27:27,101
不是已经超过了吗?
Don't we already?

435
00:27:27,544 --> 00:27:31,275
每个伟大的社会  每个伟大的文明
Every great society,  every great civilization,

436
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:33,507
都会有一支强大的海军作为后盾
always anchored by a great navy.

437
00:27:33,717 --> 00:27:35,378
  肖议员    谢谢
  Congressman Shaw.    Thanks very much.

438
00:27:35,586 --> 00:27:38,453
见到你很高兴，鲍勃  感谢前来
Nice to see you, Bob.  Thanks for coming.

439
00:27:39,523 --> 00:27:40,717
议员
Congressman.

440
00:27:43,427 --> 00:27:45,190
本・马高
Ben Marco.

441
00:27:45,396 --> 00:27:48,092
我知道，你好，上尉
I know. Hello, captain.

442
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,198
最近好吗？
How you doing?

443
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:53,199
  我需要和你谈谈    好啊
  I need to talk to you.    Okay.

444
00:27:53,537 --> 00:27:56,005
噢，我的天，雷蒙德  这么多年了没见了
Oh, my God, Raymond,  it's been so many years.

445
00:27:56,206 --> 00:27:57,673
  还有呢？    我结过婚
  And?    And I've been married,

446
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:59,069
  又离了    哦
  I've been divorced.    Yeah.

447
00:27:59,276 --> 00:28:01,244
嗯，你也许注意到我有那么一点变化
Well, you may have noticed  I've changed a bit myself.

448
00:28:01,445 --> 00:28:05,040
不，不，那不是...  不，是的，我注意到了
No. No, that's not...  No, yes, I have noticed.

449
00:28:05,249 --> 00:28:09,242
我知道，那很棒  恭喜你
I see. It's great.  Congratulations.

450
00:28:09,453 --> 00:28:10,943
但是我的感情依旧
My feelings haven't, though.

451
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,924
我是说，依旧没变
Changed, I mean.

452
00:28:17,628 --> 00:28:20,893
什么感情？什么？
What feelings? What?

453
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:24,432
乔斯林，我一直在想
Jocelyn, I have never  stopped wondering

454
00:28:24,635 --> 00:28:27,866
我们两人之间会怎么样
how things might have turned out  between us

455
00:28:28,072 --> 00:28:30,700
  如果我母亲没有...    雷蒙德
  if my mother hadn't-     Raymond.

456
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:33,433
雷蒙德，人无法改写自己的人生
Raymond, people can't just  rewrite their lives.

457
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:38,343
自从我们分手后...
I haven't had a relationship...

458
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:40,915
我就没再跟任何人有进一步的交往了
...of any consequence  since we stopped seeing each other.

459
00:28:41,118 --> 00:28:43,586
这对你没有任何意义吗？
Doesn't that say something to you?

460
00:28:44,421 --> 00:28:47,254
嗯，那...
Yeah, that...

461
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:51,053
那你一定是世界上最孤单的人了
That you must be just about  the loneliest person on this earth.

462
00:28:51,962 --> 00:28:55,591
雷蒙德，那时我们只是孩子  那已经有，嗯，15年了吧
Raymond, we were kids then. It must  have been, what, 1 5 years ago?

463
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:56,925
是很甜蜜，不过...
It was sweet, but...

464
00:28:57,835 --> 00:28:59,200
乔斯
Joce.

465
00:29:00,037 --> 00:29:02,631
来了，我得走了
Yeah. I have to go.

466
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,307
哦
Yeah.

467
00:29:04,508 --> 00:29:05,975
祝竞选好运
Best of luck with the campaign.

468
00:29:06,677 --> 00:29:07,701
谢谢
Thank you.

469
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:13,450
乔斯...
Joce...

470
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,210
雷蒙德・肖中士
Sergeant Raymond Shaw.

471
00:29:20,357 --> 00:29:22,450
我也很想和你谈谈
I wanna talk to you too.

472
00:29:24,795 --> 00:29:26,023
  现在没空    对不起，先生
  Not now.    Excuse me, sir.

473
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,720
我是说，我知道你很忙，议员--
I mean, I know you're busy,  congressman--

474
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:29,796
  不要碰我    我很抱歉
  Don't touch me.    I'm sorry.

475
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,969
对不起，只是，那个--
I'm sorry, it's just that, well--

476
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,138
千万不要碰我
Don't ever touch me.

477
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:41,771
你好，少校  你尝过泰国炒米粉了没？
Hello, major.  Have you tried the Pad Thai?

478
00:29:42,045 --> 00:29:44,639
我听说它棒极了
I'm told it rules.

479
00:29:52,689 --> 00:29:54,748
你希望肖议员会说什么？
What were you hoping  Congressman Shaw would say?

480
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:56,888
我不知道，先生
I don't know, sir.

481
00:29:57,995 --> 00:30:02,125
关键不在他说或不说什么，而是他的
It's not so much what he said  or didn't say, it was more of his...

482
00:30:02,332 --> 00:30:03,959
...他的态度，他的举止
...attitude, his demeanor.

483
00:30:04,468 --> 00:30:05,730
你在服药吗？
Are you taking your meds?

484
00:30:05,936 --> 00:30:08,131
霍华德中校，恕我直言
Lieutenant Colonel Howard,  with all due respect,

485
00:30:08,338 --> 00:30:10,306
过去的12年以来专家一直告诉我说
I've had over a dozen years  of experts telling me

486
00:30:10,507 --> 00:30:13,271
我有海湾战争综合症  我有外伤遗忘失调症
that I have Gulf War Syndrome,  I have post-traumatic stress disorder

487
00:30:13,477 --> 00:30:16,674
还有其他你叫得出名字的  各类情绪失调症
and every other mood disorder  that you can name.

488
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,316
在这12年里，我一直是个优秀军人
In those 1 2 years,  I've been a good soldier.

489
00:30:20,517 --> 00:30:23,577
而且我一直试图否定
And I've denied what  every nerve ending in my body

490
00:30:23,787 --> 00:30:25,516
我身体里每根神经都在告诉我的真相
is telling me is more real than not.

491
00:30:25,722 --> 00:30:28,054
我每晚都做一个梦  不是千变万化的梦
I've had one dream,  not variations on a dream,

492
00:30:28,258 --> 00:30:29,816
而是完全相同的梦  一夜接着一夜
the same dream.  Night after night--

493
00:30:30,027 --> 00:30:33,087
不，不，对不起
No. No. I'm sorry.

494
00:30:33,297 --> 00:30:35,765
你是在说整个班的美国陆军战士
You're saying that an entire squad  of U.S. Army soldiers

495
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:37,900
都受到催眠而认为雷蒙德・肖
was hypnotized into believing  that Raymond Shaw

496
00:30:38,101 --> 00:30:39,659
有资格获得荣誉勋章？
deserved the Medal of Honor.

497
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,598
而且从某种意义上说，因为你这个梦
And that somehow,  thanks to your dream,

498
00:30:42,806 --> 00:30:45,331
你成了唯一洞悉真相的人了
you're the only one  who knows the truth.

499
00:30:46,076 --> 00:30:49,136
马高少校，你被禁止接近肖议员
Major Marco, you will stay clear  of Congressman Shaw.

500
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:57,552
你要继续药物治疗
And you are to resume  your medication.

501
00:30:57,754 --> 00:30:59,654
这是命令
That is an order.

502
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:01,415
就这样了，少校
That will be all, major.

503
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:05,117
此时此刻，一名在反恐战前线的美国士兵
Somewhere right now, an  American soldier in the war on terror

504
00:31:05,329 --> 00:31:07,661
正在为故乡的家人忧心
is worried about his  family back home.

505
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:11,458
此时此刻，在某个美国小镇
Somewhere right now,  in some small American town,

506
00:31:11,668 --> 00:31:14,432
他的祖母站在厨房里
his grandmother is standing  in her kitchen.

507
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:17,198
她一手拿着药瓶
She's got her medicine bottle  in one hand,

508
00:31:17,407 --> 00:31:20,808
她另一只握着冰箱门把手，心想：
she's opening the refrigerator  with the other and she's thinking:

509
00:31:21,745 --> 00:31:24,043
“是买药呢...
"I can pay for my medicine...

510
00:31:25,082 --> 00:31:27,277
...还是买晚餐？
... or I can pay for my dinner.

511
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:30,244
两者不可兼得”
I can't do both. "

512
00:31:30,821 --> 00:31:32,618
我相信我们的母亲和祖母们
I don't believe that our mothers  and grandmothers

513
00:31:32,823 --> 00:31:35,883
不应该面临这种抉择  在我们这个国家不可以
should have to face that kind of  decision, not in this country.

514
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:41,124
我相信我们军队中在海外出生入死
I don't believe that the brave men  and women of our armed forces,

515
00:31:41,331 --> 00:31:43,891
的英雄儿女们绝不应该
risking their lives overseas,  should have to worry

516
00:31:44,701 --> 00:31:48,228
为他们远在国内的家人担心
about their families back here  in America.

517
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:51,534
你们看，在这个国家里有许多裂隙
You see, there are some gaps  in this country...

518
00:31:52,743 --> 00:31:55,610
...许多需要我们填补的鸿沟
... deep chasms  that we need to bridge.

519
00:31:57,447 --> 00:31:59,244
富人和穷人之间
The gap between rich and poor,

520
00:31:59,616 --> 00:32:02,983
政府与民众之间的
between government  and the people,

521
00:32:03,186 --> 00:32:06,553
真正的安全和自我感觉的安全之间的
between true security  and the notion of feeling safe.

522
00:32:06,757 --> 00:32:08,987
二楼，三号房间，走廊尽头
Second floor, room three,  end of hall.

523
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:11,950
真相和...
Between what is real...

524
00:32:12,162 --> 00:32:13,652
难道你不喜欢这家伙吗？
Don't you just love this guy?

525
00:32:13,864 --> 00:32:15,525
...和假相之间的
And what is not.

526
00:32:16,633 --> 00:32:19,329
采取强硬政策对领导人  是难以避免的选择
Tough choices are an unavoidable  element of leadership,

527
00:32:19,536 --> 00:32:22,096
我只是恳请当政者记住
I would just urge the governor  to remember that

528
00:32:22,306 --> 00:32:25,867
政府的首要责任...
the primary responsibility  of government...

529
00:32:48,365 --> 00:32:50,128
艾尔・迈尔文
Al Melvin.

530
00:32:52,402 --> 00:32:55,098
艾尔，我是本・马高  你在吗？
Al, it's Ben Marco.  Are you in there?

531
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,244
狐狸进了鸡窝
Fox is in the henhouse.

532
00:33:02,446 --> 00:33:04,175
黄鼠狼
Weasel.

533
00:33:05,282 --> 00:33:08,683
黄鼠狼是...
Weasel is...

534
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,481
黄鼠狼就是黄鼠狼
The weasel is a weasel.

535
00:33:14,157 --> 00:33:15,886
先生，我就在外面
Sir, I'll be right outside.

536
00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:17,615
什么？
What?

537
00:33:18,328 --> 00:33:20,489
我就在外面，先生
I'll be right outside, sir.

538
00:33:21,331 --> 00:33:22,696
我知道
I know.

539
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:25,958
  晚安    晚安，先生
  Good night.    Good night, sir.

我给你30秒，妈妈
You have 30 seconds, Mother.

543
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:57,998
你知道是我？
Am I that predictable?

544
00:33:58,301 --> 00:34:00,201
我完全不知道
You have no idea.

545
00:34:00,437 --> 00:34:03,167
我是打电话来恭喜你，没好气先生
I'm calling to compliment you,  Mr. Grumpy.

546
00:34:03,373 --> 00:34:06,342
我认为你今晚表现太棒了
I thought you were  magnificent tonight.

547
00:34:06,576 --> 00:34:09,511
那些电视竞选专家也持同样观点
And so did all the network  campaign experts.

548
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:13,574
还有那套饱含同情，居安思危的作派
And that compassionate  vigilance thing

549
00:34:13,784 --> 00:34:16,548
你运用得恰到好处
is working quite well for you.

550
00:34:17,254 --> 00:34:20,280
  我也许该改投你的旗下了    我刚巧说的是真心话
  I might have to convert.    I happen to believe in it.

551
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,014
哦，是的，那当然
Oh, yes, of course you do.

552
00:34:22,259 --> 00:34:24,489
  听着，雷蒙德...    晚安，妈妈
  Now, Raymond...    Good night, Mother.

553
00:34:24,728 --> 00:34:27,356
雷蒙德？什么？不，等等
Raymond? What? No, wait, wait.

554
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:30,593
  等一下    什么？雷蒙德？
  Hang on a second.    What? Raymond?

555
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:32,363
你在吗？
Are you there?

556
00:34:35,038 --> 00:34:36,437
喂?
Yes?

557
00:34:36,807 --> 00:34:38,672
肖中士？
Sergeant Shaw?

558
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:40,771
你是哪位？
Who is this?

559
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:44,605
  雷蒙德 肖中士?    是

去你套房的卧室

564
00:34:59,262 --> 00:35:01,958
走进那里的门厅

565
00:35:02,165 --> 00:35:05,760
走到头，打开壁橱

566

是，谢谢

568
00:35:42,706 --> 00:35:44,571
你记得我吗？
Do you remember me?

569
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:50,746
不，先生，不记得
No, sir, I don't.

570
00:35:51,014 --> 00:35:53,574
很好  我们要做个20分钟的小小的身体检查
Brilliant. We've got 20 minutes  for our little checkup

571
00:35:53,783 --> 00:35:56,616
当然是头部的  先生们，让我们脱下他的外衣
from the neck up, gentlemen,  so if we could take his jacket.

572
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,720
请坐
Please sit down.

573
00:36:01,723 --> 00:36:04,385
不，维拉鲁伯斯先生，我...  军方指派我收集…
No, Mr. Villalobos, I'm just...  The Army's got me gathering

574
00:36:04,593 --> 00:36:07,494
有关焦虑失调症的信息  所以我只是...
information on stress disorders,  so I'm just...

575
00:36:07,729 --> 00:36:11,130
...你明白的，只是做个统计  想知道我的旧部下--
...you know, just running statistics,  trying to find out about my old team--

576
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,961
好吧，听着，威尔逊先生
Well, listen. Mr. Wilson,

577
00:36:17,205 --> 00:36:21,733
内森回家后，他是不是  整天只想着科威特的战事?
when Nathan came home,  was he preoccupied with Kuwait?

578
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:23,570
我的意思是说，他有没有做恶梦之类的？
I mean, did he have nightmares  or bad dreams

579
00:36:23,778 --> 00:36:25,473
和那边的战争有关的
about the firefight over there?

580
00:36:30,252 --> 00:36:34,882
麻醉膏抹上去的时候你会感到有点凉
You'll feel a little cold  as this anesthetic gel goes on.

581
00:36:39,895 --> 00:36:42,159
针套...

583
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:51,238
请放松  你放松了么， 雷蒙德？
Please relax.  Are you relaxed, Raymond?

584
00:36:51,473 --> 00:36:52,565
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

585
00:36:52,841 --> 00:36:57,574
现在，雷蒙德，我要在你颅骨上钻一个小洞
Now, Raymond, I am going to drill  a tiny hole in the skull,

586
00:36:57,812 --> 00:37:01,680
为了放入新的植入物
which will allow delivery  of the new implant.

587
00:37:02,284 --> 00:37:05,344
所以，你会感到一点点不舒服  你也许会感到些许压迫
So, what you'll feel is a little  discomfort in the form of pressure

588
00:37:05,554 --> 00:37:07,954
有点压迫感，还会听到剧烈的震动噪音
and also a loud vibrating noise  in your head,

589
00:37:08,156 --> 00:37:12,115
所有这些，当然，都是绝对正常的
all of which, of course,  is completely normal.

590
00:39:14,149 --> 00:39:15,548
谢谢
Thank you.

591
00:39:18,253 --> 00:39:21,086
当然，一旦手术完成
Of course, as soon as this  or any task is completed,

592
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:26,192
你就会忘记这件事了
you will already have forgotten  that it ever actually took place.

593
00:39:27,095 --> 00:39:29,086
现在探针进入
Probe going in now.

594
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,237
好
Good.

595
00:39:42,043 --> 00:39:43,840
非常好
Excellent.

596
00:39:44,045 --> 00:39:46,479
释放植入物
Releasing implant.

597
00:39:46,681 --> 00:39:49,172
好了  没什么的吧，是不是，雷蒙德？
There. That wasn't so bad,  was it, Raymond?

598
00:39:49,384 --> 00:39:50,681
是，先生
No, sir.

599
00:39:51,352 --> 00:39:53,650
很好，没有腐化，没有滑动
That's good. No decay, no slippage.

600
00:39:53,855 --> 00:39:58,053
所有的看起来都完美无瑕
Everything seems to be  in flawless working condition.

601
00:40:23,918 --> 00:40:25,852
现在，雷蒙德
Now, Raymond.

602
00:40:26,087 --> 00:40:29,648
你能想起一等兵贝克和  英格拉姆是怎么死的吗？
Can you remember the deaths  of Private Baker and Private lngram?

603
00:40:29,858 --> 00:40:30,847
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

604
00:40:31,092 --> 00:40:33,583
好，请你向我描述一下好吗？
Good. Can you describe them  for me, please?

任务顺利完成，在回去的路上--
The mission ends without incident.  We're heading back--

610
00:40:49,978 --> 00:40:52,742
“在回司令部的路上  夜色清静，有星星...”
"Toward the command.  The night is clear. Stars..."

611
00:40:52,981 --> 00:40:56,348
夜色清静，有星星， 但没有月亮
The night is clear.  Stars, but no moon.

612
00:40:56,918 --> 00:40:58,180
巡逻队遭遇伏击

613
00:40:58,386 --> 00:41:01,617
我们意外遭遇了有直升机援助的地面部队
We're engaged unexpectedly by  ground forces with helicopter support.

614
00:41:01,823 --> 00:41:04,656
敌方使用了火榴弹, 迫击炮

615
00:41:04,993 --> 00:41:06,551

In the ensuing firefight, Eddie lngram  gets himself separated to the left.

618
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:17,531
贝克前去支援
Baker goes after him.

619
00:41:17,739 --> 00:41:19,832
敌军的一发迫击炮弹令他们当场丧生
An incoming mortar shell  kills them both instantly

620
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:23,477
我还没来得及确定炮火方位，将之消灭
before I am able to locate and  eliminate the source of the ordnance.

621
00:41:25,313 --> 00:41:28,680
上尉，马高上尉

622
00:41:28,883 --> 00:41:30,350

抱歉，这座位有人吗？

哦, 我知道你喜欢走荒无人烟的道

纸袋还是塑料袋？

626
00:42:06,588 --> 00:42:09,853
哦，好啦，我是那家店里的

在纽约城四周到处转转

634
00:42:35,016 --> 00:42:37,450
我看见你坐在这里，然后我想，“嘿
And I saw you sitting here  and I said, "Hey,

635
00:42:37,652 --> 00:42:40,519
为什么不过去和他打个招呼？”

也许我那个时候我感到有点娇弱
...maybe I was feeling fragile  at the time.

654
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:50,757
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

655
00:43:50,959 --> 00:43:52,290
对不起
Excuse me.

656
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:41,840
你好，上尉
Hello, captain.

657
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:44,009
还记得我吗？
Do you remember me?

658
00:45:16,244 --> 00:45:17,575
本
Ben.

659
00:45:18,479 --> 00:45:21,937
嘿，我准备叫辆车  想让我带你到什么地方去吗？
Hey. I'm gonna get a cab.  You want me to drop you somewhere?

660
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:23,344
不，不用了
No, I'm okay.

661
00:45:23,551 --> 00:45:25,348
好吧，这么说你朋友要来接你了？
Okay. So your friend's  gonna meet you here, then?

662
00:45:25,553 --> 00:45:26,918
不
No.

663
00:45:28,489 --> 00:45:29,888
那好吧
All right.

664

艾尔多拉多，59970

00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:39,330
这是我的手机号码  如果你...你知道...
It's my cell phone number,  in case you ever... You know.

666
00:45:39,534 --> 00:45:41,525
我喜欢用比较老套的说法--
I like to say it the old-fashioned way.

667
00:45:41,736 --> 00:45:45,103
你能记住吗，还是要我给你刻在胸口上？
Can you remember or should I write it  on your chest with a Sharpie?

668
00:45:45,973 --> 00:45:48,203
  我能记住    那好
  I'll remember.    Okay.

669
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:51,242
嘿，你有点...
Hey, you're kind of...

670
00:45:51,913 --> 00:45:54,404
要找个地方来歇歇神吗？
You need somewhere to go  to freshen up?

671
00:45:56,217 --> 00:45:57,878
五角大楼的监察人员今天指控

和其他紧急医疗物资的价格
during the recent  Indonesian incursion,

675
00:46:07,028 --> 00:46:11,294
该公司刚刚获得一项  未经投标的5亿美元合约
even as the company secured  a half-billion-dollar no-bid contract

676
00:46:11,499 --> 00:46:14,627

to provide combat support services  to American soldiers

677
00:46:14,836 --> 00:46:17,031
所需的战备物资的供应
preparing to mobilize in Sri Lanka.

678
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,347
到了
There you go.

679
00:46:32,153 --> 00:46:33,518
进来吧
Come on in.

680
00:46:33,721 --> 00:46:36,281
这是我堂姐的公寓
This is my cousin's apartment.

681
00:46:36,724 --> 00:46:38,624
  她在吗？    不在
  Is she here?    No.

682
00:46:38,826 --> 00:46:40,885
就算再破
Be it ever so humble.

683
00:46:41,295 --> 00:46:43,525
还是自己的窝好啊，是不？
No place like home, right?

684
00:46:43,764 --> 00:46:46,961
信不信由你，这里还能看到风景呢
Believe it or not, there's a view.

685
00:46:47,168 --> 00:46:50,262
到防火梯那儿，抬起头
Go to the fire escape  and tilt your head up,

686
00:46:50,505 --> 00:46:52,700
应该还能看见一棵树呢
you can almost see a tree.

687
00:46:54,842 --> 00:46:57,140
  要喝点什么？    不，不用了
  Can I get you something to drink?    No, I'm fine.

688
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:02,544
这里有一些减肥茶
I've got some dieter's tea.

689
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:06,379
有助于你的新陈代谢  如果你相信它的话
It's great for your metabolism,  if you're into that.

690
00:47:06,587 --> 00:47:11,547
要不来点番茄汁？不要？好吧
Or some tomato juice. No? All right.

691
00:47:12,226 --> 00:47:13,887
或者...

692
00:47:14,095 --> 00:47:15,187
...白开水？
...some water?

693
00:47:15,663 --> 00:47:17,790
  不必了，谢谢    对不起
  No, thank you.    I'm sorry.

694
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,391
我有点紧张，一紧张我就喋喋不休
I'm nervous.  I yak when I get nervous.

695
00:47:22,503 --> 00:47:24,266
你的堂姐在哪里？
Where is she, your cousin?

696
00:47:25,606 --> 00:47:27,574
她跟着“梦女郎”乐队巡回演出去了
She's on tour with Dreamgirls.

697
00:47:38,853 --> 00:47:40,047
嘿，你还好吧？
Hey, are you okay?

698
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:44,055
嗯
Yeah.

699
00:47:46,861 --> 00:47:49,921
我对之前发生的事很抱歉
Look, I'm sorry about  what happened earlier.

700
00:47:50,131 --> 00:47:52,656
你不必向我道歉
You don't have to apologize to me.

701
00:47:53,701 --> 00:47:55,862
我给你冲些茶
I'll make you some tea.

702
00:48:34,909 --> 00:48:38,401
天，柠檬在那儿？好了
Jesus. Where's the lemon? Okay.

703
00:48:39,113 --> 00:48:42,810
  你没事吧？    嗯，我很好
  You okay in there?    Yeah, I'm fine.

704
00:48:43,417 --> 00:48:46,716
你看，我给你准备了浴巾  你看见了么？
You know, I left you some towels  in there, did you see them?

705
00:48:50,691 --> 00:48:52,818
  怎么回事？    包掉了
  What was that?    Dropped my bag.

706
00:49:00,434 --> 00:49:01,901
本
Ben?

707
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:04,967
你没事吧？
Are you okay in there?

708
00:49:05,439 --> 00:49:06,770
呼叫本
Earth to Ben.

709
00:49:07,508 --> 00:49:08,873
没事
Yeah.

710
00:49:09,143 --> 00:49:12,306
  真的没事吗？    是
  You sure everything's all right?    Yes.

711
00:49:15,216 --> 00:49:16,740
本？
Ben?

712
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,787
本？
Ben?

713
00:49:28,496 --> 00:49:30,259
本？
Ben?

714
00:49:31,165 --> 00:49:32,359
本
Ben.

715
00:49:36,871 --> 00:49:38,270
本?
Ben?

716
00:50:01,862 --> 00:50:03,193
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

717
00:50:07,601 --> 00:50:09,296
你看见那个了吗？
Did you see that?

718
00:50:13,107 --> 00:50:15,234
在我手里的东西
What I had in my hand.

719
00:50:19,313 --> 00:50:22,146
这不是幻觉，德尔皮  它就在我手里
I wasn't hallucinating, Delp.  I held it in my hand.

720
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:24,716
他们都是这么说，马高
That's what they all say, Marco.

721
00:50:24,952 --> 00:50:28,012
“沙漠风暴”期间你们  都沾上了些邪恶的东西
Some wicked shit got sprayed  on you guys during Desert Storm.

722
00:50:28,589 --> 00:50:31,717
我是说，除了贫铀弹的辐射微尘之外
Besides all the depleted uranium,  I mean.

723
00:50:32,393 --> 00:50:34,452
我认识几个突击队员
I personally know of  a couple of Rangers

724
00:50:34,662 --> 00:50:37,426
他们发誓现在不戴上  有色眼镜就成了瞎子
who swear that they see only  in tertiary colors now,

725
00:50:37,631 --> 00:50:40,691
  德尔皮    还说还说只要一靠近康爱迪生公司的变压器
  Delp.    and can pick up sports talk radio

726
00:50:40,901 --> 00:50:44,359
脑子里就能接收到体育广播
in their cortical block if they get  too close to a Con-Ed transformer.

727
00:50:44,772 --> 00:50:46,672
这不是海湾战争综合症
It's not Gulf War Syndrome.

728
00:50:53,514 --> 00:50:59,646
军队确实试用过一种微型  可植入的身份识别装置
The Army did try this  tiny, implantable lD thing.

729
00:51:01,455 --> 00:51:04,515
可以植入皮下，然后像条形码那样扫描
You could imbed it under the skin,  then scan it like a bar code

730
00:51:04,725 --> 00:51:07,353
记录了一些急救信息
for medical emergency information:

731
00:51:07,795 --> 00:51:10,025
血型，DNA等等
Blood type, DNA.

732
00:51:10,231 --> 00:51:12,290
哦，军方从没给我装过这个
Well, the Army never put one in me.

733
00:51:16,103 --> 00:51:18,367
这是你以为的，伙计
That you know of, man.

734
00:51:20,875 --> 00:51:22,638
你以为如此
That you know of.

735
00:51:33,354 --> 00:51:36,619
今天美军飞机轰炸了几内亚的几处选定目标
U. S. planes bombed selected sites  in Guinea today, acting on intelligence

736
00:51:36,824 --> 00:51:40,191
根据情报，这个非洲国家的军事政权
that the African nation's military  regime had secretly resumed

737
00:51:40,394 --> 00:51:42,021
正在秘密恢复其化学武器计划
its chemical weapons program.

738
00:51:42,229 --> 00:51:44,424
国防部长拒绝就空袭发表评论
The secretary of defense declined  to comment on the attack,

739
00:51:44,632 --> 00:51:46,532
只是说此次任务圆满完成
saying only that the mission  was successful,

740
00:51:46,734 --> 00:51:49,760
目标达到，所有参加行动的美国人员
targets acquired, that all American  personnel involved here

741
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:53,406
  都已安全返回    罢工的公交工人...
  were home safe and sound.    Striking transportation workers...

742
00:51:54,608 --> 00:51:59,011
对于在那儿发生的事，我所梦到的
My dreams seem more real to me

743
00:51:59,213 --> 00:52:02,614
比我记忆中的更真实，就好像...
than what I actually remember  happening over there. It's like...

744
00:52:04,852 --> 00:52:10,290
就好像在什么地方我被洗过脑，而且...
It's like somewhere along the line  I got brainwashed or something and...

745
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:15,424
我的脑子好像乱成一团了
I'm just, like, all scrambled up.

746
00:52:16,597 --> 00:52:18,622
我们都被洗过脑，马高
We have all been  brainwashed, Marco.

747
00:52:19,834 --> 00:52:23,201
至于说有人把电子探针
As for somebody  imbedding electric probes

748
00:52:23,404 --> 00:52:27,966
和电脑芯片植入你的大脑  让你惟命是从
and computer chips in your brain  to make you do things,

749
00:52:28,209 --> 00:52:30,040
那纯属无稽之谈，伙计
it's horseshit, man.

750
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:34,213
稍微给点电击...
A little electroshock...

751
00:52:35,149 --> 00:52:38,710
...再加上睡眠剥夺就可以达到同样的效果  代价却小得多
...and sleep deprivation will do  the trick for a fraction of the price.

752
00:52:38,919 --> 00:52:40,910
你可以去问乌兹别克人
Ask the Uzbeks.

753
00:52:42,122 --> 00:52:44,090
那我的那些梦呢？
What about my dreams?

754
00:52:45,392 --> 00:52:48,623
假如现在这一切都只是你的梦...
What if all this is your dream...

755
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:52,665
...而你实际上仍身在科威特呢？
...and you are really  still back in Kuwait?

756
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:19,753
  谢谢你们，谢谢    议员
  Thanks for coming out. Thank you.    Congressman!

757
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,518
  议员！    议员！
  Congressman!    Congressman!

758
00:53:21,729 --> 00:53:24,391
议员！议员！  为什么你和阿瑟州长
Congressman! Congressman!  Why do you and Governor Arthur

759
00:53:24,598 --> 00:53:26,395
反对调遣军队进驻印尼？
oppose deploying troops  into lndonesia?

760
00:53:26,634 --> 00:53:28,067
哦，阿瑟州长和我认为
Well, Governor Arthur and I believe

761
00:53:28,269 --> 00:53:29,998
我们不能用卑鄙的手段清理世界
we can't clean up the world  with dirty hands.

762
00:53:30,204 --> 00:53:31,865
肖中士!
Sergeant Shaw!

763
00:53:33,607 --> 00:53:35,336
你有没有梦到过科威特?
Do you ever dream about Kuwait?

764
00:53:35,676 --> 00:53:37,473
马高上尉
Captain Marco.

765
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,143
没关系，没关系
It's okay. It's okay.

766
00:53:41,348 --> 00:53:42,838
很高兴见到你，先生
Nice to see you, sir.

767
00:53:43,083 --> 00:53:45,483
晚上好，我也很高兴见到你
Good evening.  It's good to see you too.

768
00:53:45,786 --> 00:53:47,253
为什么向我问起科威特？
Why did you ask me about Kuwait?

769
00:53:47,454 --> 00:53:48,944
我没问你那个，我是问你的梦
I didn't.  I asked you about your dreams.

770
00:53:49,156 --> 00:53:50,453
  谢谢，丽莉    肖议员，很抱歉
  Thank you, Lily.    Congressman Shaw, I'm sorry.

771
00:53:50,658 --> 00:53:53,024
他们想知道你能否在6点  接受拉里・金的采访？
They wanna know if you can do  an interview with Larry King at 6?

772
00:53:53,227 --> 00:53:54,785
  不，不    不接受采访还是6点不行？
  No, no.    No to the interview or no to 6?

773
00:53:54,995 --> 00:53:56,485
不，他又想谈关于我母亲的事，不行
No. He wants to talk  about my mother. No.

774
00:53:56,697 --> 00:53:58,528
  一切正常吗， P.J.？    你好，先生
  Everything under control, P.J.?    Hello, sir.

775
00:53:58,766 --> 00:54:00,461
见到你很高兴
Good to see you.

776
00:54:00,701 --> 00:54:02,669
那么，上尉，我能为你做些什么？
So, captain, what can I do for you?

777
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:04,303
我只耽误你几分钟
I just need a few minutes  of your time.

778
00:54:04,505 --> 00:54:05,767
肖议员，能否打扰一下？
Congressman Shaw,  a moment, please?

779
00:54:05,973 --> 00:54:06,940
私人时间
Private time.

780
00:54:07,141 --> 00:54:09,837
不幸的是，这就是我所谓的私人时间了
Unfortunately, this is as private  as it gets for me now.

781
00:54:10,044 --> 00:54:11,568
  我了解    他没问题的，威尔
  I understand.    He's all right, Will.

782
00:54:11,779 --> 00:54:13,804
  进来吧    谢谢，谢谢
  Come on in.    Thank you, thank you.

783
00:54:15,316 --> 00:54:18,012
  嘿，乔治    那些梦
  Hey, George.    There are these dreams

784
00:54:18,218 --> 00:54:20,982
我们小分队的一些人一直都在做这些梦
that some of the men  from our unit have been having.

785
00:54:21,188 --> 00:54:22,519
包括你？
Including you?

786
00:54:22,723 --> 00:54:24,020
嗯...
Well...

787
00:54:24,625 --> 00:54:27,685
...实际上事关那天晚上
...it's more of a question  of what actually happened

788
00:54:27,895 --> 00:54:29,920
我们遭到袭击后究竟发生了什么事
the night that our patrol  got attacked.

789
00:54:30,464 --> 00:54:34,730
很简单，我们在伊拉克  控制地区执行例行侦察
That's easy. We're on a routine recon  inside lraqi-controlled terrain.

790
00:54:34,935 --> 00:54:37,563
巡逻队遭遇伏击，敌方  敌方使用了火榴弹, 迫击炮
The patrol is ambushed.  RPG incoming, mortar fire.

791
00:54:37,771 --> 00:54:40,001
  你被击中--    失去了知觉，这和我记得的完全--
  You're knocked-     Unconscious. Exactly the way--

792
00:54:40,207 --> 00:54:43,142
不是要打断你，我是说这和  我记忆中的完全一样
Not to cut you off, but I mean,  exactly the way that I remember it.

793
00:54:43,344 --> 00:54:46,177
但我梦到的却不是这样
But I dreamed something else.

794
00:54:47,781 --> 00:54:49,271
你的梦中有我吗，上尉？
Am I in your dreams, captain?

795
00:54:50,217 --> 00:54:51,809
是的，有你，议员
Yes, you are, congressman.

796
00:54:52,152 --> 00:54:53,278
救了所有人？
Saving everybody?

797
00:54:53,487 --> 00:54:56,479
不是那么简单  瞧，迈尔文下士
It's a whole lot more complicated  than that. Now, Corporal Melvin,

798
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:59,158
他画下，写下了他梦见了什么
he's been drawing these pictures  and he wrote down what he dreams.

799
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,294
  如果你刚好--    我没有做什么梦，上尉
  Maybe if you just-     I don't have dreams, captain.

800
00:55:02,229 --> 00:55:05,130
从来没有？你一点梦都不做？  每个人都会做梦的，不是吗？我是说--
At all? You don't dream at all?  Everybody dreams, right? I mean--

801
00:55:05,332 --> 00:55:07,664
听着，上尉，我很想帮助你  我想，我真的很想
Look, captain, I'd like to help you,  I would, I really would,

802
00:55:07,868 --> 00:55:09,665
但我觉得你应该去见见
but I think you ought to  see somebody.

803
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:11,929
  那些专门的--    我看过医生了
  Somebody who specializes in-     I've been to doctors.

804
00:55:12,439 --> 00:55:14,031
哦，好，那就好
Well, good, that's very good,

805
00:55:14,241 --> 00:55:16,801
因为他们比我更能帮助你
because they can probably  help you out a lot more than I can.

806
00:55:17,044 --> 00:55:18,671
  我不知道，但是--    保重，上尉
  I don't know, but-     Take care, captain.

807
00:55:18,879 --> 00:55:21,473
  嗯，嗯，好    谢谢你来拜访
  Yeah. Yeah. Okay.    Thanks for coming by.

808
00:55:27,955 --> 00:55:29,684
我没疯，肖
I'm not crazy, Shaw.

809
00:55:33,927 --> 00:55:35,451
少校
Major.

810
00:55:37,665 --> 00:55:41,533
  本，你饿了么？    饿极了
  Ben. Are you hungry?    Starving.

811
00:55:47,207 --> 00:55:48,606
嗯，那取决于人口统计
Well, it depends on the demographic.

812
00:55:48,842 --> 00:55:50,139
对不起
Excuse me.

813
00:55:51,645 --> 00:55:53,579
  我杀了贝克？    嗯，那只是个梦
  I killed Baker?    Well, it's a dream.

814
00:55:53,781 --> 00:55:55,908
我是说，也可能另有含义
I mean, it could mean  something else.

815
00:55:56,383 --> 00:55:58,715
比如可能我凭空想出来的
It could mean I'm supposed  to think you did.

816
00:55:58,919 --> 00:56:02,787
不，我杀的是敌人  我也不认识他们，所以...
No, I killed the enemy.  I didn't know them either, so...

817
00:56:03,157 --> 00:56:04,818
...这没什么  ...没关系
...it was okay.

818
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:08,494
不管怎样，我记得我们在科威特做了什么  我十分清楚的记得
And anyway, I remember what we did  in Kuwait. I remember it perfectly.

819
00:56:08,696 --> 00:56:09,924
只是...
I just...

820
00:56:10,431 --> 00:56:12,865
...不记得真的做过与否
...don't remember actually doing it.

821
00:56:13,634 --> 00:56:15,295
也许你根本没做过
Maybe you didn't do it.

822
00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:23,799
不
No.

823
00:56:24,778 --> 00:56:26,370
这真荒谬
What a thought.

824
00:56:44,498 --> 00:56:45,931
什么？
What?

825
00:56:50,738 --> 00:56:52,797
生活很奇怪，不是么？
Life is so bizarre, isn't it?

826
00:56:53,841 --> 00:56:55,433
什么地方奇怪？
Which part?

827
00:56:55,642 --> 00:56:58,110
我不知道  你在楼下看见了什么
I don't know.  What you saw downstairs.

828
00:56:58,579 --> 00:57:04,518
这次竞选，政治，我的公共生活和角色
This campaign. Politics.  My whole public life and persona.

829
00:57:06,053 --> 00:57:09,853
我是说，摆姿势，陪笑脸  像个该死的木偶
I mean, posing and grinning  like a goddamn sock puppet,

830
00:57:10,057 --> 00:57:12,719
和那些完全陌生的人握手
shaking hands with total strangers  who must be completely blind

831
00:57:12,926 --> 00:57:15,326
他们如果不能一眼把我看穿  就一定是瞎子
if they can't see  what I am at the core.

832
00:57:15,529 --> 00:57:18,464
看不到我妈妈一手造就的我  又一个普兰蒂斯家族的人
What my mother has made me.  A Prentiss.

833
00:57:18,665 --> 00:57:20,929
一个讨厌的普兰蒂斯
Ferociously a Prentiss.

834
00:57:21,502 --> 00:57:23,270
  但不是肖。不，先生    我明白
  But not a Shaw. No, sir.    I see.

835
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:24,828
  但不是肖。不，先生    我明白
  But not a Shaw. No, sir.    I see.

836
00:57:25,372 --> 00:57:26,930
不，你没明白
No, you don't.

837
00:57:27,908 --> 00:57:29,102
你也没办法明白
You can't.

838
00:57:31,578 --> 00:57:33,546
我20岁前都没有朋友
I was 20 years old  before I had a friend.

839
00:57:33,747 --> 00:57:39,743
更糟的是，第一个朋友是个女朋友  哦，你知道，在我看来算是女朋友
Worse, a girlfriend. Well, you know,  from my point of view, anyway.

840
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:44,022
一个不在我妈妈允许接触范围之内的朋友
A friend outside of my mother's circle  of approved encounters

841
00:57:44,224 --> 00:57:46,351
而她...
and she...

842
00:57:48,729 --> 00:57:50,424
...我母亲...
...my mother...

843
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:57,960
只有上帝才知道她对乔斯林说了什么  把她赶走了
God only knows what she told  Jocelyn to chase her away.

844
00:57:58,505 --> 00:58:01,133
这激发了我平生唯一的反抗行动：
Precipitating my sole act  of rebellion:

845
00:58:01,341 --> 00:58:03,172
狂怒之下...
Storming off...

846
00:58:03,977 --> 00:58:06,468
...我入伍参了军
...and enlisting in the Army.

847
00:58:09,883 --> 00:58:11,316
但是战争之后...
But after the war...

848
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,515
...我又回到她身边
...I came back to her.

849
00:58:17,191 --> 00:58:19,386
你为什么回来？  发生了什么？
Why did you come back?  What happened?

850
00:58:23,997 --> 00:58:25,794
难道你没在听么？
Weren't you listening?

851
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,468
我母亲的作用
Mother happened.

852
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:31,900
你知道，实际上我非常痛恨这件事
You know, the truth is I hate it.

853
00:58:32,339 --> 00:58:34,637
我也总是厌恶那枚勋章
I've always despised the Medal.

854
00:58:35,242 --> 00:58:38,609
那些小人令人作呕的阿谀奉承
The cloying adulation  of the little people.

855
00:58:39,613 --> 00:58:41,911
很显然...
It's certainly...

856
00:58:42,149 --> 00:58:44,743
...我没什么值得你嫉妒的，少校
...nothing for you  to be jealous of, major.

857
00:58:44,952 --> 00:58:46,317
我不是嫉妒
I'm not jealous.

858
00:58:47,287 --> 00:58:49,084
我没有那些梦，本
I don't have the dreams, Ben.

859
00:58:49,556 --> 00:58:53,925
你怎么会不记着救过  我们整个小分队呢？
How could you not remember  saving our unit?

860
00:58:54,494 --> 00:58:55,927
我记得，我说了我救过
I do. I said I did.

861
00:58:56,129 --> 00:58:59,690
不，不，你没说过  你说你不记得真的做过与否
No, no, you didn't. You said  that you didn't remember doing it.

862
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,232
那是你几分钟以前说的话
That's what you just said  a couple minutes ago.

863
00:59:03,971 --> 00:59:06,166
每当我回想起那个夜晚...
When I think about that night...

864
00:59:07,774 --> 00:59:10,436
...就好象我事先知道将要发生什么
...it's as if I know what will happen.

865
00:59:11,678 --> 00:59:13,373
问题是，我从来就没感觉到过
The thing is, I never seem  to get to the point

866
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:16,811
那是实实在在发生过的事情
where I feel that it actually  does happen.

867
00:59:17,017 --> 00:59:18,848
但我相信那是非常正常的
But I'm sure that's perfectly normal.

868
00:59:19,152 --> 00:59:22,747
好吧，那你和其他人谈过这些么？  这些自相矛盾的事？
Okay. Well, have you discussed this  with anyone? These discrepancies?

869
00:59:23,123 --> 00:59:25,318
我能和谁说呢？
Who would I share that with?

870
00:59:26,059 --> 00:59:28,425
我的老战友们喜欢我爱戴我
My old Army buddies  who love and adore me

871
00:59:28,629 --> 00:59:30,756
因为我救过他们那些不值钱的小命
for saving their  pathetically unimportant,

872
00:59:30,964 --> 00:59:33,432
难道找我周围的那些浑蛋？
present company excluded, asses?

873
00:59:33,901 --> 00:59:35,960
你可以和军队的情报部门谈谈
You could discuss it  with Army intelligence.

874
00:59:36,169 --> 00:59:39,570
你可以去那儿，我可以陪你一起去
You could go down there.  I mean, I could go with you

875
00:59:39,773 --> 00:59:41,968
谈一下这件事，告诉他们你所记得的
and discuss it and you can tell them  what you remember,

876
00:59:42,175 --> 00:59:45,144
和你记不起来的，他们会...
what you don't remember,  and they could...

877
00:59:45,879 --> 00:59:47,642
...做一些测试
...run some tests.

878
00:59:50,384 --> 00:59:52,784
是的，测试，哦
Yeah, tests. Boy.

879
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:55,011
新闻界就会有事情做了
The press would have  a field day with that.

880
00:59:55,689 --> 00:59:58,385
有人在我的身体里植入了一个装置  我今天早上发现的
Somebody put an implant inside me.  I found it this morning.

881
00:59:58,592 --> 01:00:00,822
我背上还有个洞  你要看我可以给你看看
I've got the hole in my back  if you wanna take a look at it.

882
01:00:01,028 --> 01:00:03,588
而且我觉得他们很有可能  在你身上也放了一个
And I got a good feeling  they put one in you too.

883
01:00:09,636 --> 01:00:11,297
没有人在我身体里放任何东西，本
Nobody has put anything  in me, Ben.

884
01:00:11,505 --> 01:00:13,632
让我来证明给你看  为什么不，你知道的...
Let's prove it.  Why don't, you know...

885
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,432
  我们去做个X光检查...    听着，本
  We'll go get an x-ray...    Look, Ben,

886
01:00:15,642 --> 01:00:17,439
我想支持你，真的
I wanna be supportive of you. I do.

887
01:00:17,644 --> 01:00:20,238
但是你不觉得应该把这个放到选举之后么？
But don't you think this could wait  till after the election?

888
01:00:20,447 --> 01:00:21,607
为什么？因为什么？
Why? For what?

889
01:00:21,815 --> 01:00:23,874
  你害怕什么？    我不怕任何事
  What are you scared of?    I'm not afraid of anything.

890
01:00:24,084 --> 01:00:26,848
  那么我们为什么不证明一下--    知道么？我想你应该走了
  Then why don't we just prove it-     Know what? I think you should leave.

891
01:00:27,054 --> 01:00:29,614
  对不起，我真的--    听着
  I'm sorry, I really-     Listen.

892
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:34,624
有人用钢针,切割器和锯子
Somebody got into our heads  with big steel-toe boots,

893
01:00:34,828 --> 01:00:37,296
打开我们的脑袋，为所欲为
cable cutters and a chainsaw  and they went to town.

894
01:00:37,497 --> 01:00:40,955
剥离出脑细胞，将神经回路重新搭接
Neurons got-  Got-   Got exposed and circuits got rewired.

895
01:00:41,168 --> 01:00:43,898
我们的脑细胞被清除了，雷蒙德
Our brain cells got  obliterated, Raymond.

896
01:00:44,104 --> 01:00:45,662
求你了
Please.

897
01:00:46,573 --> 01:00:48,541
你需要帮助，本
You need to get help, Ben.

898
01:00:49,343 --> 01:00:51,573
你要干什么？本！
What are you doing? Ben!

899
01:00:55,816 --> 01:00:57,511
住手！住手！
Stop! Stop!

900
01:00:57,818 --> 01:00:59,012
房间里面！房间里面！
Inside! Inside!

901
01:01:05,025 --> 01:01:06,014
议员！
Congressman!

902
01:01:11,898 --> 01:01:13,695
他咬了他，他咬了他
He bit him. He bit him.

903
01:01:18,171 --> 01:01:19,832
把他从这弄出去
Get him out of here.

904
01:01:27,547 --> 01:01:29,139
你还好吧，先生？
Are you okay, sir?

905
01:01:31,752 --> 01:01:33,185
  都给我出去    先生，我们应该--
  Leave me alone.    Sir, we should--

906
01:01:33,387 --> 01:01:34,945
出去！
Get out!

907
01:02:09,222 --> 01:02:10,951
我们是从波托马克河把他捞上来的
We fished him out of  the Potomac River

908
01:02:11,158 --> 01:02:14,059
大概在昨天下午4：45
about 4:45 yesterday afternoon.

909
01:02:15,162 --> 01:02:18,029
你去艾尔・迈尔文的公寓干什么？
What were you doing  in Al Melvin's apartment?

910
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:20,723
我去和他谈谈，他不在家
I went to talk to him.  He wasn't home.

911
01:02:20,934 --> 01:02:23,926
谈什么？那些梦？
Talk about what? Dreams?

912
01:02:26,873 --> 01:02:28,363
有趣的东西
Interesting stuff.

913
01:02:28,575 --> 01:02:31,601
是啊，他家里有几百件那样的东西
Yeah, there's hundreds  of those in his place.

914
01:02:31,812 --> 01:02:33,074
你应该让你的人去查一下
You should have your people  check it out.

915
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,747
哦，我们马上就派人去
Oh, we'll get on that right away.

916
01:02:34,948 --> 01:02:38,281
盖瑞特上校非常通容的  给我们看了你的档案，马高
Colonel Garret was kind enough  to show us the file on you, Marco.

917
01:02:38,485 --> 01:02:41,784
你可真了不起，不是么？
You are the real deal, aren't you?

918
01:02:43,056 --> 01:02:46,082
特种部队，突击队，三角洲部队
Special Forces. Rangers. Delta.

919
01:02:48,095 --> 01:02:49,858
我想和迈尔文下士谈谈
I wanted to talk to Corporal Melvin

920
01:02:50,063 --> 01:02:53,931
问他关于91年科威特那次侦察中...
to ask him some  unanswered questions about...

921
01:02:54,134 --> 01:02:56,796
...我的一些疑问
...our reconnaissance  in Kuwait back in '91.

922
01:02:57,003 --> 01:02:58,868
  他不在家    是的，不在
  He wasn't home.    Right. He wasn't there.

923
01:02:59,072 --> 01:03:02,599
所以，你觉得可以破门而入进去等他？
So, what, you thought it was okay  to just break in and wait for him?

924
01:03:02,809 --> 01:03:04,276
如果你们在暗示我杀了他  我可以告诉你们没有
I didn't kill him,  if that's where you're headed.

925
01:03:04,478 --> 01:03:06,139
没人说你杀了他
Nobody said you did.

926
01:03:06,346 --> 01:03:07,836
可能他是自杀的
Maybe he committed suicide.

927
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:11,713
你为什么缠上了雷蒙德・肖？
What's your obsession  with Raymond Shaw?

928
01:03:11,918 --> 01:03:13,476
我没有缠上他
I'm not obsessed  with Raymond Shaw.

929
01:03:13,687 --> 01:03:15,348
他的梦中情人
The man of his dreams.

930
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:18,687
你也许可以让你们的法医
You may want to ask  your medical examiners

931
01:03:18,892 --> 01:03:20,757
检查一下迈尔文的后背
to check Melvin's back.

932
01:03:20,961 --> 01:03:22,622
在肩胛骨附近的皮肤下面
It's under the skin  just shy of the scapula.

933
01:03:22,829 --> 01:03:25,662
你们会发现一个植入物
They may find a implant.

934
01:03:25,866 --> 01:03:27,527
就在皮肤下面，左肩
Just under the skin, left side.

935
01:03:27,734 --> 01:03:29,964
如果他们不仔细找，是找不到的
If they don't look real hard,  they won't find it.

936
01:03:30,504 --> 01:03:32,836
他们在找的时候也可以象这样唱歌
They could sing that while  they're looking for it if they like.

937
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:34,904
  植入物    是的
  lmplants.    That's what I said.

938
01:03:35,108 --> 01:03:36,769
植-入-物
I-M-plant.

939
01:03:36,977 --> 01:03:41,676
是的，但是从你的档案上看
Yeah, but judging from  your file here, apparently,

940
01:03:41,882 --> 01:03:44,316
你似乎对自己的情况是一无所知，朋友
you don't know your shit  from your oatmeal, my friend.

941
01:03:44,518 --> 01:03:46,145
对不起，没有必要
Excuse me. This is unnecessary.

942
01:03:46,887 --> 01:03:48,354
你有毛病吗？
You got a problem?

943
01:03:49,456 --> 01:03:52,721
心理上的？你看起来有点生气了
Psycho? You look a little angry.

944
01:03:53,927 --> 01:03:56,691
也许你想揍我？  来吧，打啊
Maybe you wanna hit me?  Go ahead, you can do it.

945
01:03:57,864 --> 01:04:00,560
  嘿！    看在上帝的份上，本...
  Hey!    For God's sake, Ben...

946
01:04:02,202 --> 01:04:03,260
他打我
He hit me.

947
01:04:04,538 --> 01:04:06,267
你还想帮他？
And you wanna help him?

948
01:04:06,473 --> 01:04:10,102
不，那在相等于政治自杀，绝对不行
No. That would be political suicide.  Of course not.

949
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:12,578
我想让你帮他
I want you to help him.

950
01:04:15,282 --> 01:04:18,445
我甚至不能想象为什么
I can't even imagine why.

951
01:04:19,186 --> 01:04:22,349
妈妈，我向你保证我求您这么做
Mother, I can assure you, I am as  uncomfortable asking you to do this

952
01:04:22,556 --> 01:04:24,717
正如您一样是万分情愿的
as you are being asked.

953
01:04:25,058 --> 01:04:27,652
我的人正在申请对他的限制令
My campaign people are getting  a restraining order against him.

954
01:04:27,861 --> 01:04:31,092
他会上每一个安全监视名单  但是我不会把他关起来
He's going on every security watch list,  but I won't lock him up.

955
01:04:31,298 --> 01:04:33,960
  我不想起诉他    什么？
  I'm not pressing charges.    What?

956
01:04:34,167 --> 01:04:36,328
我不知道，只是...
I don't know, it's just...

957
01:04:39,906 --> 01:04:41,339
我现在不想谈这个
I don't wanna talk  about this right now.

958
01:04:41,541 --> 01:04:43,338
我们能回到竞选上  把精力集中在这方面么--
Can we get back to the campaign  and focus on something--

959
01:04:43,543 --> 01:04:46,944
雷蒙德，你不会相信他的鬼话吧？
Raymond, you don't actually  believe his story?

960
01:04:48,815 --> 01:04:50,646
不
No.

961
01:04:51,184 --> 01:04:53,243
但是他相信
But he does.

962
01:04:54,821 --> 01:04:57,255
他是个好士兵
And he's a fine soldier.

963
01:04:58,291 --> 01:05:01,021
如果为了使他保持清醒
And if his slim hold  on sanity requires

964
01:05:01,228 --> 01:05:03,696
我必须容忍他的精神错乱直到他得到帮助  我会这样做的
that I tolerate his delusions  until he can get help, I'll do it.

965
01:05:03,897 --> 01:05:05,524
那对我没有伤害
It doesn't diminish me.

966
01:05:06,132 --> 01:05:08,066
我不怕他
I'm not afraid of him.

967
01:05:09,202 --> 01:05:10,692
雷蒙德
Raymond.

968
01:05:18,378 --> 01:05:21,973
你对你的朋友有多了解？
How much do you actually know  about your friend?

969
01:05:53,446 --> 01:05:55,380
哦，真是可怜
Oh, that's sad.

970
01:05:55,582 --> 01:05:57,482
可怜的小兵
Poor little tin soldier.

971
01:05:57,684 --> 01:05:59,379
妈妈，求你了
Mother, please.

972
01:05:59,586 --> 01:06:02,180
你只要想想马高少校  昨天在竞选总部出现的时候
Well, just imagine how terrified  your people were yesterday

973
01:06:02,389 --> 01:06:04,721
你的人有多惊慌
when Major Marco showed up  at campaign headquarters

974
01:06:04,924 --> 01:06:06,516
你还邀请他--
and you invite--

975
01:06:06,726 --> 01:06:08,819
上帝，你还邀请他进来
My God, you invited him in.

976
01:06:09,462 --> 01:06:10,929
他们还对他的情况都了若指掌
With all they know about him.

977
01:06:11,931 --> 01:06:13,865
我了解他
I know him.

978
01:06:14,467 --> 01:06:16,435
我在他手下当兵，他是个好人
I served under him.  He was a good man.

979
01:06:16,636 --> 01:06:19,833
是啊，连环杀手的邻居也都这样说他们
Well, that's what the neighbors  always say about serial killers.

980
01:06:28,782 --> 01:06:31,615
你可以走了，肖没有起诉你
You're out of here.  Shaw won't press charges.

981
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:37,785
有人从埃莉诺・肖参议员的办公室打电话
Someone from  Senator Eleanor Shaw's office called

982
01:06:37,992 --> 01:06:40,153
为你开脱
and intervened on your behalf.

983
01:06:40,361 --> 01:06:42,921
少校，你已经达到了  军方所能容忍的底线
Major, you've reached the terminal end  of the Army's patience.

984
01:06:43,131 --> 01:06:45,759
你已经被免职，立即生效
You're relieved of duty,  effective immediately.

985
01:06:48,036 --> 01:06:49,765
是，长官
Yes, sir.

986
01:06:49,971 --> 01:06:51,302
本
Ben,

987
01:06:51,506 --> 01:06:54,737
在沃尔特・里德有一个年轻的神经科医师  名叫扎恩
there is a young neurologist  at Walter Reed. His name is Zahn.

988
01:06:54,942 --> 01:06:57,206
他在海湾战争综合症方面很有研究
He's had real success  with Gulf War Syndrome.

989
01:06:57,412 --> 01:06:59,346
你要整理好你的材料
You are instructed to get  your affairs in order

990
01:06:59,547 --> 01:07:01,606
周一一大早就到他那去报道
and report to him  first thing Monday morning.

991
01:07:27,809 --> 01:07:29,572
我记着你说你把它弄丢了
I thought you said you lost it.

992
01:07:29,777 --> 01:07:31,335
我咬了一个家伙，又找到了一个
I bit a guy. I found another one.

993
01:07:34,115 --> 01:07:36,982
这些应该是不存在的啊
These are not supposed to exist.

994
01:07:44,192 --> 01:07:46,683
这只是在理论上存在的
These are only theoretical.

995
01:07:51,799 --> 01:07:53,323
它是干什么用的？
So, what does it do?

996
01:07:53,534 --> 01:07:55,866
  我不知道    你不知道？
  I don't know.    You don't know?

997
01:07:57,972 --> 01:07:59,735
我不知道
I don't know.

998
01:08:02,076 --> 01:08:05,102
我不想知道，你也不会想知道
I don't wanna know.  You don't wanna know.

999
01:08:05,313 --> 01:08:08,043
你看，它从你的身体里出来  而你还活着
Look, it's out of you  and you are still alive.

1000
01:08:08,249 --> 01:08:10,376
那就是好消息
That's the good news.

1001
01:08:10,885 --> 01:08:12,409
那坏消息是什么？
What's the bad news?

1002
01:08:14,756 --> 01:08:16,849
可能他们知道你在这
Maybe they know you're here.

1003
01:08:35,676 --> 01:08:38,804
你说的那些军用植入物
You said the Army implants,  they were for

1004
01:08:39,013 --> 01:08:41,413
它们是用于存放急救资料的，对吧？
emergency medical data, right?

1005
01:08:41,616 --> 01:08:44,312
他们确实是这样宣称的
The ones they publicized were.

1006
01:08:45,052 --> 01:08:50,319
曾经同时还进行着另一项计划,  研究各种可怕的植入体
There was a parallel project  for all kinds of scary implantables.

1007
01:08:50,525 --> 01:08:54,052
克林顿的特工们最终怕了这东西  计划就中止了
The Clinton watchdogs finally  freaked out about it, closed down.

1008
01:08:54,262 --> 01:08:56,355
另一项计划？
Parallel project?

1009
01:08:56,564 --> 01:08:57,792
你是怎么知道的？
How did you know about that?

1010
01:08:57,999 --> 01:09:02,800
满洲国际集团曾经资助我  制作那些可怕的玩意儿
Manchurian Global funded me  to make some of their scary shit.

1011
01:09:03,004 --> 01:09:04,733
听说过他们么？
Heard of them?

1012
01:09:05,606 --> 01:09:07,801
想象一下，那不只是一个公司，马高
Imagine not just  a corporation, Marco,

1013
01:09:08,009 --> 01:09:11,638
而是一个该死的政体附属物
but a goddamn geopolitical  extension of policy

1014
01:09:11,846 --> 01:09:14,076
从尼克松党政时就开始了
for every president since Nixon.

1015
01:09:14,282 --> 01:09:16,011
金钱就是上帝，马高
Cash is king, Marco.

1016
01:09:16,217 --> 01:09:18,276
金钱就是上帝
Cash is king.

1017
01:09:29,764 --> 01:09:31,891
你确定你非要这么做么？
You sure you wanna do this?

1018
01:09:32,099 --> 01:09:33,828
当然
Absolutely.

1019
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:37,799
因为我不想
Because I don't.

1020
01:09:38,005 --> 01:09:39,336
我欠你一个人情
I'll owe you one.

1021
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:41,269
不
No.

1022
01:09:41,476 --> 01:09:43,273
我还欠着你的人情
I still owe you.

1023
01:09:44,378 --> 01:09:46,676
因为你把我从阿尔巴尼亚弄出来
For getting me out of Albania.

1024
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:48,178
阿尔巴尼亚
Albania.

1025
01:09:53,888 --> 01:09:54,855
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

1026
01:09:55,056 --> 01:09:56,819
以防我忘掉这些我想要记住的事
In case I forget things  I wanna remember.

1027
01:10:01,929 --> 01:10:06,889
我正在给你注射甲氨己糖醇合剂  来模糊你的意识
I'm putting you on a cocktail  of methohexitol to take the edge off.

1028
01:10:07,101 --> 01:10:08,568
模糊什么意识？
The edge off of what?

1029
01:10:08,769 --> 01:10:12,500
重新清晰前的模糊  或者随便你叫它什么
Getting clarity.  Or whatever you wanna call it.

1030
01:10:13,241 --> 01:10:17,507
电休克疗法严格说是不算科学的
ECT not being  the precise science that, say,

1031
01:10:17,712 --> 01:10:19,680
跟水蛭吸血疗法差不多
Ieeching is.

1032
01:10:19,881 --> 01:10:22,179
你不认为这会起作用？
You don't think  this is gonna work?

1033
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:25,580
这是没有办法的办法，伙计
It's a desperation move, man.

1034
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:28,518
但是，嘿，有个学派就声称
But, hey, there is a school  of thought that says

1035
01:10:28,723 --> 01:10:31,055
用来诱发其情绪宣泄的人--
a victim of induced abreaction--

1036
01:10:31,259 --> 01:10:33,227
来了
Here it comes.

1037
01:11:04,792 --> 01:11:06,783
夜色清静，有星星，但没有月亮
The night is clear.  Stars, but no moon.

1038
01:11:06,994 --> 01:11:08,188
巡逻队遭遇伏击
The patrol is ambushed.

1039
01:11:08,396 --> 01:11:11,832
我们在伊拉克控制地区执行临行侦察
We were on a routine recon  inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,

1040
01:11:12,033 --> 01:11:13,967
评估敌军实力...
assessing troop strength...

1041
01:11:14,168 --> 01:11:16,033
马高上尉被击中失去了知觉
Captain Marco was  knocked unconscious.

1042
01:11:16,237 --> 01:11:19,172
在随后的交战中，  埃迪・英格拉姆被敌军分割在左翼
In the ensuing firefight, Eddie Ingram  gets himself separated to the left.

1043
01:11:19,373 --> 01:11:20,567
贝克前去支援
Baker goes after him.

我们能把人们从可怕的  精神负担中解脱出来
We can free people  from the terrible burden

1179
01:24:20,053 --> 01:24:22,385
帮他们忘记过去痛苦的经历
of an emotionally  compromised past.

1180
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:28,059
  看着点路！    对不起
  Watch where you're going!    Sorry.

1181
01:24:28,261 --> 01:24:29,353
看着点路！
Watch where you're going!

1182
01:24:29,563 --> 01:24:31,497
退后！退后
Just back up! Just back up.

1183
01:24:31,698 --> 01:24:34,929
看着点，看着点，闭嘴
Watch it. Watch it. Shut up.

1184
01:24:36,770 --> 01:24:38,567
放松点，先生
Take it easy, sir.

1185
01:24:43,210 --> 01:24:46,338
我给五角大楼打了电话  他们说他在保外就医
I called the Pentagon and they told me  he's on medical leave.

1186
01:24:46,546 --> 01:24:50,448
特工部门已经把他列进一系列监视名单中
Secret Service, they got him on a  couple of their watch and observe lists.

1187
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:54,047
我想这个人跟肖议员之间
I guess there's been some trouble  with this guy

1188
01:24:54,254 --> 01:24:56,051
一定有什么过节
involving Congressman Shaw.

1189
01:24:57,257 --> 01:24:58,622
哦？
Oh?

1190
01:25:01,595 --> 01:25:05,156
在满洲国际集团的股东中
Among the shareholders  in Manchurian Global,

1191
01:25:05,365 --> 01:25:07,492
如果他们真要发布一个名单的话  当然他们是不会的
were they to ever publish a list,  which they won't,

1192
01:25:07,701 --> 01:25:11,034
你会发现里面有前任总统  被废黜的君王
you would find former presidents,  deposed kings,

1193
01:25:11,238 --> 01:25:13,729
信托基金恐怖分子  倒台的共产主义独裁者
trust fund terrorists,  fallen Communist dictators,

1194
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:17,535
什叶派穆斯林权威，非洲军阀  还有退休的首相
ayatollahs, African warlords  and retired prime ministers.

1195
01:25:17,744 --> 01:25:19,837
  明白我的意思吗？    我明白，他们很强大，非常强大
  See what I mean?    I get it. They're big. They're huge.

1196
01:25:20,046 --> 01:25:21,479
他们...他们...  简直势力巨大无比
They're... They're...  They're gigantic.

1197
01:25:21,681 --> 01:25:23,546
我没能力去碰他们，我知道了  我也不想碰
I can't touch them. I get it.  I don't want to.

1198
01:25:24,384 --> 01:25:25,851
你给我带来的只是些谣言和猜想
And you bring me rumors  and conjecture.

1199
01:25:26,052 --> 01:25:27,952
我刚开始只是做恶梦  谣言和猜想
I started with nightmares.  Rumors, conjectures,

1200
01:25:28,155 --> 01:25:29,645
那对我来说已经是个巨大的进步
that's a giant leap forward.

1201
01:25:30,123 --> 01:25:33,149
这些就是你用来解释你恶梦的主要资料:
Nightmares that you've interpreted  using as primary resources

1202
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:34,520
一，你零星的记忆
A, your spotty memory,

1203
01:25:34,728 --> 01:25:36,423
二，互联网
B, the lnternet,

1204
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:40,066
白痴和疯子的神圣庇护所  他们就是这么来看互联网的
sacred sanctuary of idiots and nutters.  That's how they're gonna look at this.

1205
01:25:40,267 --> 01:25:42,735
还有三，一个疯子的笔记
And C, a crazy man's notebook,

1206
01:25:42,936 --> 01:25:44,801
加上你从一个男人后背上  咬下来的证据
along with evidence you chewed  out of a man's back.

1207
01:25:45,005 --> 01:25:47,132
这些都可以被同一根线索  完美地串联起来
All neatly stitched together  with a common thread

1208
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:51,436
一个非常有权势，有着强大的  关系网的私人基金会
of a supremely powerful,  well-connected private equity fund,

1209
01:25:51,645 --> 01:25:53,340
无论是谁，如果曾经接近过他们
who, if you ever get  anywhere near them,

1210
01:25:53,547 --> 01:25:55,105
都会声称自己对他们一无所知  并且心有余悸
will plead ignorance  and be shocked.

1211
01:25:55,315 --> 01:25:56,407
余悸犹在地获悉
Shocked to learn

1212
01:25:56,616 --> 01:25:59,141
该集团一些合作伙伴所在从事的勾当
what some of their subsidiary  partners are engaged in.

1213
01:25:59,352 --> 01:26:01,343
我才不在乎什么满洲国际集团, 先生
I could give a rat's ass  about Manchurian Global, sir.

1214
01:26:01,555 --> 01:26:03,113
我一点也不在乎他们
I could give a rat's ass about them.

1215
01:26:03,690 --> 01:26:05,681
那不是我来这的原因
That is not why I'm here.

1216
01:26:09,863 --> 01:26:11,888
我也查过你的资料，参议员
I looked you up too, senator.

1217
01:26:14,034 --> 01:26:15,695
哦？
Oh?

1218
01:26:16,736 --> 01:26:18,533
你曾经当过兵
You were in the Army.

1219
01:26:18,738 --> 01:26:19,932
我是被征召入伍的
I was drafted.

1220
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:22,870
恐怕不能算个好士兵，让我看看
Didn't make much of a soldier,  I'm afraid. Let me see this.

1221
01:26:23,076 --> 01:26:25,840
那倒跟我在资料中看到的不一样  资料中不是这么说的，先生
That's not what I saw in the record.  That's not what the record says, sir.

1222
01:26:26,046 --> 01:26:28,810
你也知道战争是怎么样的
And you know how it works.

1223
01:26:29,216 --> 01:26:31,548
战争是一场场战斗打下来的
Wars are fought  one battle at a time.

1224
01:26:31,751 --> 01:26:34,049
战役是一颗颗子弹赢下来的
Battles, you win one bullet at a time.

1225
01:26:34,254 --> 01:26:36,848
我无须对你讳言
And I'd be lying to you if I said

1226
01:26:37,057 --> 01:26:39,025
我来找你很大程度上是因为
that I didn't factor in,  in a huge way,

1227
01:26:39,226 --> 01:26:42,024
你无论从个人，政治  或者爱国的角度出发
the fact that you have  a vested, personal,

1228
01:26:42,229 --> 01:26:44,993
对揭发此事的真相一定会有兴趣
political and patriotic interest  in how all of this shakes out.

1229
01:26:45,198 --> 01:26:47,098
我无须对你讳言
I'd be lying to you.

1230
01:26:49,069 --> 01:26:50,969
你是对的，少校
You're right, major.

1231
01:26:51,605 --> 01:26:53,072
我有兴趣
I do.

unleashed a blizzard  of symbolic chants from above,

1237
01:27:10,824 --> 01:27:12,189
引起了短暂的恐慌

He's been stalking Raymond,  the FBl is all over this already.

1244
01:27:30,810 --> 01:27:32,835
那些文件我也看过
I've seen the files.

1245
01:27:33,513 --> 01:27:35,947
  你看过么？    全力调查什么？
  Have you seen them?    All over what?

1246
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:40,344

  Oh, Tom.    I'm sorry, senator,

1292
01:29:42,709 --> 01:29:45,769
你到底想让我做什么呢？

1293
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:48,504
体面地退出

而不是坐井观天的人
instead of just sitting around  watching it,

1431
01:39:17,550 --> 01:39:19,848
不，他们甘于冒大风险

“这样可以么？这样可以么？”
"ls this okay? Is this okay?"

1436

你懂我意思么，马克？
You know what I'm saying, Mark?

1437
01:39:32,632 --> 01:39:35,499
他只是做他该做的事情

我一直在做梦，本

1462

哦，那太好了

1463
01:42:01,814 --> 01:42:03,076
它们在我的脑袋里
They're inside my head.

1464
01:42:03,282 --> 01:42:04,681
我们会摆脱它们的，我有证据了
We'll get them out. I got the proof.

我知道他们对我们做了什么  只是不知道为什么
I know what they did to us.  I just don't know why.

1466
01:42:06,986 --> 01:42:08,214
我梦到一些事情，本
I dream things, Ben.

1467
01:42:08,421 --> 01:42:10,753
一些不可能发生的恐怖的事情
Terrible things that can't  possibly have happened.

1468
01:42:11,123 --> 01:42:13,114
  我完了, 本--    不，没有，你就在这儿
  I'm gone, Ben-     No, you're not, you're right here.

1469
01:42:13,759 --> 01:42:15,158
本...
Ben...

1470
01:42:16,061 --> 01:42:18,120
...我要给你一个东西
...there's something I want  you to have.

1471
01:42:23,202 --> 01:42:25,067
我不配得到它
I don't deserve this.

1472
01:42:30,743 --> 01:42:32,142
乔斯林的死
Jocelyn's dead.

1473
01:42:33,479 --> 01:42:34,673
我知道
I know.

1474
01:42:35,815 --> 01:42:37,112
还有参议员
And the senator.

1475
01:42:39,151 --> 01:42:40,482
是的
Yeah.

1476
01:42:42,254 --> 01:42:44,017
是我...？
Did l...?

1477
01:42:46,292 --> 01:42:48,157
我想是的，雷蒙德，是的
I think so, Raymond, yes.

1478
01:42:49,495 --> 01:42:53,932
我不记得了，本  我不记得了
I don't remember, Ben.  I don't remember.

1479
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:56,424
雷蒙德...
Raymond...

1480
01:42:56,869 --> 01:42:59,736
...他们有没有告诉你要你做什么?
...did they tell you what it is  they want you to do?

1481
01:42:59,939 --> 01:43:01,133
那就是我想要查明的
That's what I gotta find out.

1482
01:43:01,340 --> 01:43:04,605
我想弄清楚要发生什么  在哪发生--
We gotta find out what's gonna  happen, where it's gonna happen--

1483
01:43:04,810 --> 01:43:08,177
我们是朋友么，本？  我愿意相信我们是朋友
Are we friends, Ben?  I wanna believe we were friends.

1484
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:13,147
我们之间有种联系，没人能从我们这夺走
We are connected and that's  something nobody can take from us.

1485
01:43:14,053 --> 01:43:16,248
你本可以把我关起来，但你没有
You could've had me locked up,  but you didn't.

1486
01:43:16,455 --> 01:43:18,753
这就证明了在我们内心深处
That's proof that there's something  deep inside.

1487
01:43:18,958 --> 01:43:20,585
有些地方是他们无法触及的
There's a part that they can't get to.

1488
01:43:20,793 --> 01:43:23,318
深藏于我们内心，就是真相之所在
And it's deep inside of us.  And that's where the truth is.

1489
01:43:23,529 --> 01:43:26,555
那时我们唯一的希望  那就是你我需要接近的地方
That's our only hope. That's what  you and me need to tap into,

1490
01:43:26,765 --> 01:43:29,666
也是我们用来驱逐恶梦的武器，雷蒙德
and that's what you and I are gonna  use to take them out, Raymond.

1491
01:43:29,869 --> 01:43:32,030
我们时间不多了，拜托了
We don't have much time. Please.

1492
01:43:34,673 --> 01:43:38,109
  我原以为你会更聪明些的    雷蒙德，求你了
  I thought you were smarter than that.    Raymond, please.

1493
01:43:38,310 --> 01:43:39,971
你认为他们不会预料到这些，本？
You don't think they saw this  coming, Ben?

1494
01:43:40,946 --> 01:43:43,312
你认为他们不会把你考虑进去？
You don't think they factored you in?

1495
01:43:45,951 --> 01:43:49,284
我是你的敌人，马高少校
I am the enemy, Major Marco.

1496
01:43:49,788 --> 01:43:51,619
你在说什么？
