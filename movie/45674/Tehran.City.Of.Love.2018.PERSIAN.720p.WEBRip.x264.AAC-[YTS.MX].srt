3
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:25,176
Do you know him?

4
00:02:25,218 --> 00:02:26,816
No.

5
00:02:26,858 --> 00:02:32,256
He's the best French actor.
Louis Garrel.

6
00:02:32,298 --> 00:02:35,056
He's the star of the film.

7
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:37,656
Can I ask what the film is about?

8
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:42,536
The director will tell you everything
himself. If you're selected.

9
00:02:42,578 --> 00:02:46,696
There'll be two weeks of shooting
in Tehran and two in Paris.

10
00:02:46,738 --> 00:02:49,336
Visa and travel will be arranged by us.

11
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,698
If you're selected, that is.

12
00:02:52,738 --> 00:02:54,336
So when do you start?

13
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:56,696
Casting will be done today
or tomorrow.

14
00:02:56,738 --> 00:02:59,298
The shoot begins in Tehran
in six weeks.

15
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,258
You're OK with nudity?

16
00:03:20,858 --> 00:03:22,018
Flex your biceps.

17
00:03:27,538 --> 00:03:31,736
This French actor...
Is he coming to Tehran too?

18
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,698
No. Your profile.

19
00:03:37,058 --> 00:03:41,056
- Do you have a shooting permit?
- They'll get it.

20
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:42,698
Your back.

21
00:03:44,898 --> 00:03:46,898
Flex it nicely.

22
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:57,658
Put your clothes back on.

23
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:10,778
Only 200 grams.

24
00:04:14,978 --> 00:04:16,858
If you don't like the food
in your program,

25
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:20,456
we can change it so you get results.

26
00:04:20,498 --> 00:04:23,218
No, I like the food.

27
00:04:24,378 --> 00:04:29,576
- Then you're not exercising.
- I am.

28
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:34,136
All bodies differ. I promise you...

29
00:04:34,178 --> 00:04:40,296
If you stick to it,
you'll get results.

30
00:04:40,338 --> 00:04:44,298
What about liposuction?

31
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:36,338
DR. TAHERI'S BEAUTY CLINIC

32
00:05:41,058 --> 00:05:44,416
Hi. I have an appointment at 11.

33
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:47,816
- And you are?
- Farhad Moslemi.

34
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:49,658
- Are you registered with us?
- No.

35
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:07,258
Fill this out. I'll call you.

36
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:58,098
FARHAD MOSLEMI

37
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,538
Keep your eyes open, Mr Houshmand!

38
00:07:40,818 --> 00:07:42,458
It's dangerous not to.

39
00:07:53,378 --> 00:07:57,696
- How many times were you champion?
- Three times.

40
00:07:57,738 --> 00:08:00,538
I thought it was four.

41
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:03,898
I have a nephew. He's a bodybuilder.

42
00:08:04,058 --> 00:08:07,016
He wants to compete for
a championship.

43
00:08:07,058 --> 00:08:13,536
He wasn't happy with his trainer.
I told him he should see you.

44
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:18,138
- How old is he?
- He's 26.

45
00:08:19,338 --> 00:08:21,216
You already did this one!

46
00:08:21,258 --> 00:08:22,418
Sorry.

47
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:24,778
Sit up.

48
00:08:26,858 --> 00:08:29,698
It's still sore here.

49
00:08:33,098 --> 00:08:37,258
I'll tell him to call you then.
His name is Arshia.

50
00:08:38,778 --> 00:08:39,778
Hello?

51
00:08:40,738 --> 00:08:41,858
Yes?

52
00:08:42,978 --> 00:08:44,338
Who's this?

53
00:08:45,418 --> 00:08:47,698
Ah, how are you?

54
00:08:48,618 --> 00:08:50,178
Really?

55
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:53,018
Is it confirmed?

56
00:08:53,778 --> 00:08:55,218
Sure.

57
00:08:55,778 --> 00:08:58,138
What time tomorrow morning?

58
00:08:58,978 --> 00:09:00,378
That's good.

59
00:09:00,818 --> 00:09:02,738
At the same office?

60
00:09:04,018 --> 00:09:06,898
OK. Thank you.

61
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,138
So will I get the script now? Or...

62
00:09:10,498 --> 00:09:12,218
OK, see you then.

63
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:18,578
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

64
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:25,376
- Anything else?
- Do you have any puzzles of actors?

65
00:09:25,418 --> 00:09:27,496
Actors...

66
00:09:27,538 --> 00:09:30,258
We have Al Pacino's Scarface,

67
00:09:30,378 --> 00:09:32,456
Marlon Brando's Godfather

68
00:09:32,498 --> 00:09:35,138
and a few of the Rockys too.

69
00:09:35,338 --> 00:09:37,776
- What about Louis Garrel?
- Who?

70
00:09:37,818 --> 00:09:43,138
- Louis Garrel.
- Never heard of him, what's he in?

71
00:09:47,898 --> 00:09:49,218
This is him.

72
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,698
Never seen him.

73
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:57,578
He's the most famous actor in France.

74
00:10:49,738 --> 00:10:53,698
Mina, can you come a bit earlier
tomorrow to get the delivery?

75
00:10:54,018 --> 00:10:56,858
- Sure.
- Thank you. Good night.

76
00:10:57,018 --> 00:10:58,818
Good night.

77
00:11:06,418 --> 00:11:07,898
FARHAD MOSLEMI

78
00:11:12,858 --> 00:11:17,378
Hello? Hi, handsome Farhad.

79
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:20,098
How are you, baby?

80
00:11:20,698 --> 00:11:23,178
It's Sara.

81
00:11:24,898 --> 00:11:28,256
I want us to get to know
each other better.

82
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:31,018
Oh, baby...

83
00:11:31,378 --> 00:11:36,616
Does it matter where I got
your number from?

84
00:11:36,658 --> 00:11:39,178
Yeah, I have photos.

85
00:11:40,178 --> 00:11:42,178
You have the Telegram app, right?

86
00:11:43,098 --> 00:11:45,338
So I'll send them to you.

87
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,138
Bye.

88
00:11:56,018 --> 00:11:58,218
It's a thousand pieces.

89
00:12:00,298 --> 00:12:02,298
Give me those glasses.

90
00:12:10,978 --> 00:12:13,218
At least have some fruit.

91
00:12:14,258 --> 00:12:17,816
- You didn't eat your dinner.
- I had no appetite.

92
00:12:17,858 --> 00:12:22,858
You shouldn't take those pills
on an empty stomach.

93
00:12:28,818 --> 00:12:31,258
Yes? We're coming down.

94
00:12:32,098 --> 00:12:34,258
Mina, are you ready?

95
00:12:34,818 --> 00:12:36,338
The taxi's here.

96
00:12:40,418 --> 00:12:42,336
Don't you want to put makeup on?

97
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:43,456
No.

98
00:12:43,498 --> 00:12:45,858
Mina, for the love of God,
Don't embarrass me.

99
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:48,216
Auntie was telling me
about poor Manouchehr...

100
00:12:48,258 --> 00:12:50,536
He's been waiting for us to visit

101
00:12:50,578 --> 00:12:52,418
his restaurant since it opened.

102
00:12:54,298 --> 00:12:56,376
It's not a restaurant.
It's a pizza joint!

103
00:12:56,418 --> 00:12:58,818
Whatever it is, please be nice to him.

104
00:12:59,218 --> 00:13:01,096
I don't like him.

105
00:13:01,138 --> 00:13:08,096
You've never seen him properly!
Just give him a chance this time.

106
00:13:08,138 --> 00:13:09,578
Come on, let's go.

107
00:13:25,258 --> 00:13:30,658
She said they took Firouzeh to
one of those fancy fertility clinics.

108
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:33,338
And they paid a lot of money too.

109
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,416
But now they've told her
her chances are minimal.

110
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:40,818
She should've put her eggs in the
freezer when she was much younger.

111
00:13:40,978 --> 00:13:42,136
There you go, ladies.

112
00:13:42,178 --> 00:13:44,416
Thank you, son!

113
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:48,416
This is the frozen yoghurt.
It's fat free. Enjoy it without guilt!

114
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:52,058
- Thanks, Manouchehr.
- My pleasure.

115
00:13:52,218 --> 00:13:53,416
I don't want it.

116
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,298
You didn't touch your food either!

117
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,376
I prefer ice cream.

118
00:13:57,418 --> 00:14:02,098
You should've told me!
Ice cream coming right up.

119
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,336
Poor boy, he was so excited

120
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:07,058
that you were coming, Mina.

121
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:10,178
He would've made you "Pash Melba"
had he known you only like ice cream.

122
00:14:10,298 --> 00:14:12,056
It's "Peche Melba".

123
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:14,818
Whatever you call it.

124
00:14:15,018 --> 00:14:20,018
Excuse me,
I need to go outside for a bit.

125
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:35,818
Hey, Arash, you OK, baby?

126
00:14:35,978 --> 00:14:40,578
I wanted to confirm our date tomorrow.

127
00:14:40,698 --> 00:14:43,898
Let me know. Bye.

128
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:28,018
<i>Hi, son. How are you?</i>

129
00:15:28,138 --> 00:15:31,296
<i>I wanted to tell you,
we've finally got our tickets.</i>

130
00:15:31,338 --> 00:15:35,576
<i>I can't wait to see you
and my beautiful daughter-in-law.</i>

131
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:37,418
<i>Love you...</i>

132
00:15:47,618 --> 00:15:49,458
OK, my love.

133
00:15:50,898 --> 00:15:55,898
Call me when you're done.
I'll come pick you up for dinner.

134
00:15:56,098 --> 00:15:57,338
Bye.

135
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:06,738
Vahid?

136
00:16:06,858 --> 00:16:12,296
Must I chase after you every time?
Can't you be on time for once?

137
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,618
And you dropped this!

138
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,898
Please recite a prayer
for our beloved...

139
00:16:44,018 --> 00:16:49,016
Yadollah Bagheri. The eldest of the
Bagheri family, kind father,

140
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:52,498
caring husband, and loving teacher.

141
00:16:52,618 --> 00:16:57,418
They've mentioned here
that he loved walking too. Amen!

142
00:16:57,538 --> 00:17:04,218
God bless Muhammad
and his descendants!

143
00:17:05,378 --> 00:17:10,576
<i>The sorrow of your departure</i>

144
00:17:10,618 --> 00:17:16,458
<i>Haunts me forever</i>

145
00:17:18,778 --> 00:17:24,776
<i>My eyes are forever on the door</i>

146
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:28,658
<i>Expecting your return</i>

147
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:32,178
Hi.

148
00:18:33,218 --> 00:18:34,978
How are you, buddy?

149
00:18:35,818 --> 00:18:39,298
No. It's exactly what we thought.

150
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,898
She's a time waster!

151
00:18:43,218 --> 00:18:45,578
No, the bitch doesn't pick up.

152
00:18:47,898 --> 00:18:52,978
But damn, those sexy pics
were worth the effort.

153
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:58,138
I'll wait a little longer,
I'll come round if she doesn't show.

154
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:13,336
I still don't know

155
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:15,296
what this film is about.

156
00:19:15,338 --> 00:19:19,056
Believe me, this director doesn't give
the script to anyone.

157
00:19:19,098 --> 00:19:22,858
He will tell you all you need to know
when he arrives.

158
00:19:22,978 --> 00:19:25,736
When I sent him your video yesterday

159
00:19:25,778 --> 00:19:29,496
he loved it and chose you immediately.

160
00:19:29,538 --> 00:19:32,698
You've really impressed our director!

161
00:19:33,378 --> 00:19:34,898
I just don't want to get into trouble.

162
00:19:35,018 --> 00:19:36,898
What trouble?

163
00:19:37,058 --> 00:19:38,776
If you're worried about
the shooting permit,

164
00:19:38,818 --> 00:19:41,098
I promise we won't do anything
without all the permits.

165
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:22,738
<i>Seeing your beautiful face</i>

166
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:26,258
<i>Opens the doors of heaven</i>

167
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:33,176
- Goodbye, Vahid.
- Goodbye, Uncle Khosrow.

168
00:21:33,218 --> 00:21:38,818
We're going out for dinner with my
wife and her friends. Want to join us?

169
00:21:38,978 --> 00:21:40,016
No thanks.

170
00:21:40,058 --> 00:21:42,498
I'm having dinner with Arezou.

171
00:21:42,778 --> 00:21:45,258
OK, then.
Let's get you to your fiancée.

172
00:21:55,698 --> 00:21:57,658
What do you mean?

173
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:00,978
We had a plan.

174
00:22:01,098 --> 00:22:03,898
My parents are coming
in three days to see you.

175
00:22:04,098 --> 00:22:07,458
Tell them not to come.

176
00:22:07,818 --> 00:22:10,056
We're not meant for each other.

177
00:22:10,098 --> 00:22:11,578
We are.

178
00:22:14,058 --> 00:22:18,856
We're not.
I've given it a lot of thought.

179
00:22:18,898 --> 00:22:21,136
I should've told you sooner,

180
00:22:21,178 --> 00:22:23,698
but I wanted to be sure.

181
00:22:30,858 --> 00:22:36,818
These flies are driving me nuts!
Give me that!

182
00:23:02,738 --> 00:23:04,778
Sorry. One second.

183
00:23:05,338 --> 00:23:06,698
- Hi.
- Hi.

184
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,138
- Sorry I'm a bit early.
- No worries.

185
00:23:09,258 --> 00:23:10,336
Go get ready.

186
00:23:10,378 --> 00:23:12,898
I'll come and get you when I'm done.
The lockers are over there.

187
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:14,178
Thanks.

188
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:25,056
My legs are not as built as my
upper body. They need more work.

189
00:23:25,098 --> 00:23:27,418
No. They're fine.

190
00:23:33,098 --> 00:23:35,498
Take it off.

191
00:23:41,978 --> 00:23:43,898
Flex your biceps.

192
00:23:44,138 --> 00:23:47,536
I was much bigger two months ago
when I was with my old trainer.

193
00:23:47,578 --> 00:23:49,898
He went off to Germany
and left me with another guy.

194
00:23:50,058 --> 00:23:52,138
He was into steroids and stuff.

195
00:23:52,258 --> 00:23:55,696
I didn't get along with him and
lost my groove. Now I've shrunk.

196
00:23:55,738 --> 00:23:57,458
No, you have a good body.

197
00:23:57,778 --> 00:24:00,738
If you train hard, you'll be ready for
the championships in three months.

198
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:05,858
- That's exactly what I want.
- Face me.

199
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:15,898
Arms up.

200
00:24:19,738 --> 00:24:21,338
Down.

201
00:24:30,738 --> 00:24:33,338
Flex both arms.

202
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:49,176
If you don't mind, I'll come for a few
trial sessions first.

203
00:24:49,218 --> 00:24:51,096
Then we can fix it.

204
00:24:51,138 --> 00:24:52,978
As you wish.

205
00:24:53,418 --> 00:24:57,138
Sorry. It's because I had
a bad experience recently.

206
00:24:57,258 --> 00:25:00,418
No problem. Fair enough.

207
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:07,338
- When shall we start?
- I'm ready whenever you say!

208
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:12,376
How about tomorrow, 11 a.m.?

209
00:25:12,418 --> 00:25:14,058
Great!

210
00:25:14,298 --> 00:25:18,618
Just remember to bring your exercise
and diet plan so I can take a look.

211
00:25:18,738 --> 00:25:23,178
I've got them right here on my phone.
I'll send them to you now.

212
00:25:58,018 --> 00:26:02,018
Hi. I have an appointment at 4 p.m.

213
00:26:02,258 --> 00:26:04,778
- Your name?
- Hessam Fazli.

214
00:26:14,818 --> 00:26:19,258
Here you go. Fill this out.
I'll call you.

215
00:27:12,338 --> 00:27:15,338
HESSAM FAZLI

216
00:27:33,338 --> 00:27:34,898
OK, open your eyes.

217
00:27:37,298 --> 00:27:39,256
For Botox, you better start
as soon as possible.

218
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:41,816
You don't want those lines
to get any deeper.

219
00:27:41,858 --> 00:27:43,376
Does it leave any marks?

220
00:27:43,418 --> 00:27:45,978
No, none. Sit up.

221
00:27:47,858 --> 00:27:49,496
Look here.

222
00:27:49,538 --> 00:27:52,578
I'll take these for
the before and after comparison.

223
00:27:53,218 --> 00:27:57,376
I mean, right after the injection.
Does it swell? Will there be a rash?

224
00:27:57,418 --> 00:27:59,016
Not at all. What do you do for work?

225
00:27:59,058 --> 00:28:01,576
I'm a personal trainer.
But I'm supposed to act in a film.

226
00:28:01,618 --> 00:28:03,458
Look to your right.

227
00:28:04,178 --> 00:28:07,016
What kind of film?
Any famous actors in it?

228
00:28:07,058 --> 00:28:08,698
Louis Garrel.

229
00:28:11,658 --> 00:28:13,738
He's the most famous French actor.

230
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:21,978
Arezou! Please pick up.

231
00:28:23,298 --> 00:28:27,176
We can talk things through
if you give it a chance.

232
00:28:27,218 --> 00:28:30,298
You can't just give up like this!

233
00:28:31,578 --> 00:28:34,058
I love you.

234
00:28:35,618 --> 00:28:38,538
Please talk to me.

235
00:28:41,858 --> 00:28:46,656
<i>Oh, my father! Oh, my father!</i>

236
00:28:46,698 --> 00:28:50,498
<i>Oh, my father! Oh, my father!</i>

237
00:28:50,618 --> 00:28:55,376
<i>I know you will never return</i>

238
00:28:55,418 --> 00:29:00,058
<i>But still</i>

239
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:07,298
<i>I keep the door open
and look for you everywhere</i>

240
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:13,338
<i>Say it again
Oh, my father, oh, my father</i>

241
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:18,138
<i>Oh, my father, oh, my father</i>

242
00:29:36,898 --> 00:29:39,736
There you go, Vahid. Well done!

243
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,338
You gave it your all today.

244
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:44,016
I just spoke to your dad on the phone.

245
00:29:44,058 --> 00:29:48,376
I told him your son made all of us cry
even though we hear him every day!

246
00:29:48,418 --> 00:29:50,178
Thanks.

247
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:55,698
This is for tomorrow.
A 25-year-old died in a car accident.

248
00:29:55,898 --> 00:29:58,856
Just don't go overboard with this one!

249
00:29:58,898 --> 00:30:04,258
He was an only child.
The family is devastated as it is.

250
00:30:04,418 --> 00:30:07,458
SOCIETY OF HEARTS

251
00:30:34,778 --> 00:30:40,418
"Always have the strength to leave
behind those who harm you."

252
00:30:43,378 --> 00:30:46,858
Oh, dear me!
Shall I bring you some water?

253
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,858
No. I'm fine.

254
00:30:49,578 --> 00:30:50,858
Come in!

255
00:30:55,338 --> 00:30:59,018
I'm Mina Shams. I called earlier.

256
00:30:59,138 --> 00:31:02,576
Can I register for Dr Sami's class?
"Geometry of Love and Relationships".

257
00:31:02,618 --> 00:31:05,338
Are you single?

258
00:31:05,978 --> 00:31:07,256
Yes.

259
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:12,138
Perfect! Because this class
is for singles only!

260
00:31:12,298 --> 00:31:13,818
I know.

261
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:18,218
Let me get you a form then.

262
00:31:20,538 --> 00:31:24,018
"Today is the tomorrow
you've been waiting for. Smile!"

263
00:31:24,138 --> 00:31:26,496
OK, love.
Fill this out for me.

264
00:31:26,538 --> 00:31:28,858
And you know the cost, right?

265
00:31:43,618 --> 00:31:46,336
It's such a fantastic course!

266
00:31:46,378 --> 00:31:51,378
I know lots of couples
who have met through it.

267
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:58,258
Hello, Mum?

268
00:31:58,418 --> 00:31:59,778
You OK?

269
00:32:00,778 --> 00:32:02,378
I'm not bad.

270
00:32:04,698 --> 00:32:10,778
I wanted to tell you
to postpone your trip to Tehran.

271
00:32:11,378 --> 00:32:18,058
Arezou's grandpa is sick. She went to
her hometown with her family today.

272
00:32:19,658 --> 00:32:21,498
Let's see.

273
00:32:22,778 --> 00:32:23,818
Uh-huh.

274
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:26,858
Yeah, I'll let you know.

275
00:32:34,378 --> 00:32:37,096
No, nothing's happened.

276
00:32:37,138 --> 00:32:40,178
I'm just a bit tired.

277
00:32:55,978 --> 00:32:58,698
DR TAHERI'S BEAUTY CLINIC

278
00:33:05,098 --> 00:33:07,418
Hi, Farhad.

279
00:33:07,538 --> 00:33:12,736
What happened, baby?
Are we still on for Thursday?

280
00:33:12,778 --> 00:33:13,978
Bye.

281
00:33:28,098 --> 00:33:33,058
Hi. I'm Sohrab Sabet.
I have an appointment at 11 a.m.

282
00:33:35,058 --> 00:33:37,898
Sorry, I know I'm a bit early.

283
00:33:38,898 --> 00:33:42,056
No problem. But the doctor won't be
here until 11 a.m.

284
00:33:42,098 --> 00:33:45,618
I'll wait, if you don't mind.

285
00:34:01,818 --> 00:34:03,618
Fill this out.

286
00:34:25,658 --> 00:34:29,738
Excuse me! By previous illnesses, do
they specifically mean skin problems?

287
00:34:29,898 --> 00:34:31,538
All of them.

288
00:34:45,144 --> 00:34:46,696
<i>We're definitely on
for tomorrow, sexy!</i>

289
00:34:46,738 --> 00:34:52,978
<i>And if you are as hot as your pics,
we're so on for other things too!</i>

290
00:34:55,058 --> 00:34:56,696
You haven't even seen half of it.

291
00:34:56,738 --> 00:34:58,618
Tomorrow...

292
00:35:01,298 --> 00:35:03,656
Excuse me! Sorry to bother you again.

293
00:35:03,698 --> 00:35:06,178
I was answering
the questions on your form.

294
00:35:06,298 --> 00:35:10,096
I was just wondering... Do you use
anaesthetics for laser hair removal?

295
00:35:10,138 --> 00:35:11,258
No.

296
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:15,376
So the pain is bearable then?

297
00:35:15,418 --> 00:35:18,258
Depends on the person.
Some take painkillers.

298
00:35:36,018 --> 00:35:39,058
Sorry, a little more here.

299
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,618
Yeah, that's it.

300
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:05,858
Great session, man!
I'm so pumped!

301
00:36:05,978 --> 00:36:08,058
Yeah. Good start.

302
00:36:09,858 --> 00:36:12,056
I went over your diet plan.

303
00:36:12,098 --> 00:36:13,456
It's all fine.

304
00:36:13,498 --> 00:36:16,298
You just need to add these supplements
and vitamins to it.

305
00:36:16,418 --> 00:36:21,098
I'll take whatever makes me look like
those photos you showed me.

306
00:36:21,258 --> 00:36:23,616
Back then we didn't even have access
to most of this stuff.

307
00:36:23,658 --> 00:36:27,058
Now there's so much junk out there
you never know which ones to take.

308
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,096
I know this place.

309
00:36:29,138 --> 00:36:32,898
They've got genuine products
and they give me a good discount.

310
00:36:33,018 --> 00:36:35,176
We can go together.
I'll introduce you.

311
00:36:35,218 --> 00:36:36,498
Sure, let's go.

312
00:37:31,178 --> 00:37:37,658
No girl is going to put up with
this lifestyle of yours.

313
00:37:41,898 --> 00:37:45,498
All this wailing, misery and death!

314
00:37:45,658 --> 00:37:48,058
It's unbearable!

315
00:37:48,178 --> 00:37:55,056
You seriously need some positive
energy and upbeat action.

316
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:56,818
What do you want me to do?

317
00:38:00,138 --> 00:38:01,898
You know what?

318
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:05,776
I need to get you a job with
Uncle Mammad to cheer you up.

319
00:38:05,818 --> 00:38:07,978
Let me give him a call.

320
00:38:10,818 --> 00:38:11,978
Go!

321
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:18,978
<i>My eyes staring out on the road</i>

322
00:38:19,098 --> 00:38:23,698
<i>My pure and anxious heart is beating</i>

323
00:38:23,818 --> 00:38:28,616
<i>The window opens onto
the autumn sunset</i>

324
00:38:28,658 --> 00:38:31,898
<i>The pouring rain...</i>

325
00:38:33,818 --> 00:38:35,376
His voice is not bad.

326
00:38:35,418 --> 00:38:39,416
But it's got this sorrow in it.
It's not fit for weddings.

327
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:41,056
It is, uncle!
Give him a chance.

328
00:38:41,098 --> 00:38:46,056
If you don't like it,
I won't insist any more.

329
00:38:46,098 --> 00:38:48,258
For you, OK.

330
00:38:48,658 --> 00:38:53,658
I'll let him sing
a couple of songs during dinner.

331
00:38:54,618 --> 00:38:56,498
Thank you so much, uncle!

332
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:02,816
I'm not made for this.

333
00:39:02,858 --> 00:39:06,338
I only came because I didn't have
the energy to argue with you.

334
00:39:07,058 --> 00:39:10,818
Come on! If you can't do it with
the voice you have, who can?

335
00:39:13,578 --> 00:39:15,738
You need to get yourself
out of this misery.

336
00:39:16,338 --> 00:39:19,376
You'll go,
sing a couple of happy songs

337
00:39:19,418 --> 00:39:21,458
and everything will sort itself out.

338
00:39:56,138 --> 00:40:00,018
There you go.
Only for our special customers.

339
00:40:00,138 --> 00:40:03,736
Thanks, man!
Please keep this in mind,

340
00:40:03,778 --> 00:40:05,656
we are getting Arshia ready

341
00:40:05,698 --> 00:40:07,538
for the championships in three months.

342
00:40:07,698 --> 00:40:11,018
- Please look after him.
- Sure. This place is all yours.

343
00:40:11,138 --> 00:40:13,776
Thanks. I've heard a lot about you.

344
00:40:13,818 --> 00:40:16,776
Cheers. Just like Hessam,
we are at your service.

345
00:40:16,818 --> 00:40:18,978
Sorry, one second.

346
00:40:20,898 --> 00:40:22,538
Hello?

347
00:40:22,978 --> 00:40:24,538
Yes.

348
00:40:25,378 --> 00:40:26,898
Who is this?

349
00:40:28,098 --> 00:40:30,458
No, I don't.

350
00:40:32,618 --> 00:40:34,016
Where did you get my number?

351
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:37,018
Does it matter where I got it from?

352
00:40:40,378 --> 00:40:42,498
Miss! Please don't disturb me again.

353
00:40:43,738 --> 00:40:44,898
Hello?

354
00:40:45,258 --> 00:40:46,418
Hello?

355
00:40:50,778 --> 00:40:54,058
HESSAM FAZLI

356
00:40:58,778 --> 00:41:03,136
- Thanks for the ride.
- No worries.

357
00:41:03,178 --> 00:41:05,216
I love driving.

358
00:41:05,258 --> 00:41:09,618
You've got nerves of steel
to drive in this madhouse.

359
00:41:14,898 --> 00:41:17,818
Does your friend have a sore neck?

360
00:41:18,498 --> 00:41:22,498
Aww, we know how to massage it.

361
00:41:30,898 --> 00:41:35,618
- By the way, are you on Instagram?
- Yes. Hessamfitness247.

362
00:41:35,738 --> 00:41:38,616
I'm not that active though.
Mostly use it for work.

363
00:41:38,658 --> 00:41:41,138
- Cool. I'll follow you.
- Thanks!

364
00:42:16,018 --> 00:42:18,898
Just a couple hours ago on TV...

365
00:42:19,058 --> 00:42:25,138
They were talking about a 27-year-old
who died from drinking this crap.

366
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:30,618
Heart attack.

367
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:37,018
That's from steroids.

368
00:42:42,578 --> 00:42:44,979
I was at this wedding last night...

369
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,509
The bride and groom's application
for immigration to Australia

370
00:42:47,551 --> 00:42:49,698
was approved in less than six months!

371
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:52,216
I was like, lucky bastards!

372
00:42:52,258 --> 00:42:53,698
Any news from yours?

373
00:42:56,738 --> 00:42:59,736
- Special ice cream for you.
- I had the fruit salad.

374
00:42:59,778 --> 00:43:01,458
Sorry!

375
00:43:02,418 --> 00:43:05,816
- There's your fruit salad.
- Where's my umbrella?

376
00:43:05,858 --> 00:43:08,096
Well, the fruit salad doesn't come
with an umbrella.

377
00:43:08,138 --> 00:43:10,176
But I can get you one.

378
00:43:10,218 --> 00:43:12,018
Thank you.

379
00:43:12,418 --> 00:43:15,738
So, I called my lawyer right away.

380
00:43:17,218 --> 00:43:21,738
This is so yummy. Can I take some?
So I called him and complained.

381
00:43:21,858 --> 00:43:25,578
He kept saying that
it'll come any minute.

382
00:43:25,898 --> 00:43:28,216
I'm like, just give me a rough date

383
00:43:28,258 --> 00:43:30,498
so I can plan my life.

384
00:43:31,418 --> 00:43:37,456
He kept saying
it could come any day now.

385
00:43:37,498 --> 00:43:40,216
Enough about me.
What's happening with Mr Pizza Joint?

386
00:43:40,258 --> 00:43:42,218
It was a disaster.

387
00:43:42,378 --> 00:43:44,616
I was furious.

388
00:43:44,658 --> 00:43:46,138
They need to...

389
00:43:46,258 --> 00:43:48,216
just leave you alone.

390
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:50,098
They don't give up.

391
00:43:50,498 --> 00:43:53,456
You should've applied
for Australia too.

392
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:56,858
We would've gone together
and we'd be rid of this place.

393
00:43:57,538 --> 00:44:00,778
All for me? Thanks!

394
00:44:01,058 --> 00:44:04,256
Since you're so kind,
can you take a photo of us?

395
00:44:04,298 --> 00:44:06,738
Sure.

396
00:44:09,258 --> 00:44:12,138
Mina, take your umbrella.

397
00:44:12,738 --> 00:44:15,498
Ready? Three, two, one.

398
00:44:29,978 --> 00:44:34,138
Why are you not answering your phone?
I got worried!

399
00:44:34,298 --> 00:44:35,536
I was out of it.

400
00:44:35,578 --> 00:44:38,056
You'll get back in it
when you sing at the wedding tonight.

401
00:44:38,098 --> 00:44:40,898
- No way!
- Vahid! Don't be an ass!

402
00:44:41,058 --> 00:44:42,456
I promised Uncle Mammad.

403
00:44:42,498 --> 00:44:44,698
I've got three funerals
at the mosque today!

404
00:44:44,818 --> 00:44:45,819
You don't.

405
00:44:45,861 --> 00:44:47,936
You have food poisoning and
you're not going to the mosque.

406
00:44:47,978 --> 00:44:51,416
I've sorted everything out with
Haj Agha. Sajjad is replacing you.

407
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:53,456
Have you lost your mind?

408
00:44:53,498 --> 00:44:54,696
What did you tell them?

409
00:44:54,738 --> 00:44:58,496
So let's see...
What will you wear tonight?

410
00:44:58,538 --> 00:45:00,538
Everything's black here!

411
00:45:06,618 --> 00:45:08,256
Is this your dad's suit?

412
00:45:08,298 --> 00:45:10,618
I got this for my brother's wedding
a while ago.

413
00:45:10,661 --> 00:45:12,136
Thank God your brother got married.

414
00:45:12,178 --> 00:45:14,818
Made you get one thing
that's not black.

415
00:45:26,738 --> 00:45:29,056
We might be able to sort it out.

416
00:45:29,098 --> 00:45:30,538
Got any belts?

417
00:45:34,058 --> 00:45:38,498
Sadegh, has your wife
spoken to Arezou?

418
00:45:38,658 --> 00:45:42,458
- She's not answering my calls.
- I think so.

419
00:45:42,578 --> 00:45:44,338
Put the belt on.

420
00:45:44,818 --> 00:45:47,056
What do you mean? What did she say?

421
00:45:47,098 --> 00:45:49,898
Nothing. The girl doesn't know
what she wants.

422
00:45:50,018 --> 00:45:51,738
Forget about her.

423
00:45:55,738 --> 00:45:57,498
Hi, Haj Agha.

424
00:45:59,338 --> 00:46:03,058
Yes. I don't feel well.

425
00:46:03,498 --> 00:46:06,098
I think it's food poisoning.

426
00:46:08,178 --> 00:46:10,898
I don't know what it's from.

427
00:46:12,418 --> 00:46:15,138
Must be some junk food I had.

428
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:18,978
It's all Sadegh's fault.

429
00:46:21,538 --> 00:46:23,138
Yes, he told me.

430
00:46:24,338 --> 00:46:26,818
I'll also call Sajjad to cover for me.

431
00:46:28,778 --> 00:46:32,338
Sure. Sorry for the trouble.

432
00:46:32,898 --> 00:46:34,298
See you later.

433
00:46:36,298 --> 00:46:38,818
Now we're talking.

434
00:47:12,978 --> 00:47:15,658
GEOMETRY OF LOVE AND RELATIONSHIPS
SINGLES CLASS

435
00:47:19,698 --> 00:47:25,258
If you're here for anything else,
now is the time to run away.

436
00:47:26,978 --> 00:47:30,258
OK. Introductions first!

437
00:47:30,378 --> 00:47:35,698
Tell us about yourself and
what you expect from this course.

438
00:47:39,578 --> 00:47:44,338
Reza! Let us start with our
new friends first.

439
00:47:44,538 --> 00:47:45,698
Thank you.

440
00:47:46,018 --> 00:47:47,378
So.

441
00:47:48,178 --> 00:47:49,898
You, my dear.

442
00:47:57,658 --> 00:48:00,658
Hi. I'm Mina.

443
00:48:05,578 --> 00:48:10,418
Very well. Welcome, Mina.
Tell us a bit more about yourself.

444
00:48:28,418 --> 00:48:30,656
Hi, Sara?

445
00:48:30,698 --> 00:48:32,458
- Sorry?
- Sara?

446
00:48:32,578 --> 00:48:36,898
- No.
- I'm sorry. My mistake.

447
00:49:57,258 --> 00:49:59,778
I better go before my wife kills me.

448
00:50:00,418 --> 00:50:03,696
You throw me in this mess
and now you go party!

449
00:50:03,738 --> 00:50:06,378
You call going to my in-laws' a party?

450
00:50:09,218 --> 00:50:11,978
Uncle Mammad said
he will come get you at dinner time.

451
00:50:12,578 --> 00:50:14,538
I'm off. Call me when you're done.

452
00:50:50,458 --> 00:50:55,818
Please give it up for our
handsome groom, one more time!

453
00:50:56,218 --> 00:50:58,538
Thank you.

454
00:50:59,018 --> 00:51:01,376
Our groom has to leave now

455
00:51:01,418 --> 00:51:05,458
to get back to his bride
in the ladies section.

456
00:51:05,578 --> 00:51:11,256
One more round of applause.

457
00:51:11,298 --> 00:51:13,898
Thank you.

458
00:51:15,978 --> 00:51:18,456
They're telling me dinner is served.

459
00:51:18,498 --> 00:51:23,416
Please make your way to the buffet
and help yourselves.

460
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:26,496
I've also been told that
another singer named Vahid

461
00:51:26,538 --> 00:51:28,256
is going to sing for you

462
00:51:28,298 --> 00:51:30,538
while you eat.

463
00:51:30,818 --> 00:51:33,336
But I promise
that I will be back with you

464
00:51:33,378 --> 00:51:35,698
right after dinner
with some great songs.

465
00:51:35,818 --> 00:51:38,578
One more round of applause!

466
00:52:03,098 --> 00:52:04,578
What should I play?

467
00:52:06,378 --> 00:52:08,738
This is what I know.

468
00:52:12,058 --> 00:52:15,898
These? For a wedding?

469
00:52:16,738 --> 00:52:18,898
You should've checked with me.

470
00:52:48,738 --> 00:52:54,298
<i>My eyes staring out on the road</i>

471
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:59,418
<i>My pure and anxious heart beating</i>

472
00:53:00,138 --> 00:53:05,498
<i>The window open onto
the autumn sunset</i>

473
00:53:05,618 --> 00:53:10,818
<i>The pouring rain in the street</i>

474
00:53:11,018 --> 00:53:14,738
<i>Your memory beats in my heart
at every sunset</i>

475
00:53:14,978 --> 00:53:20,738
<i>The sunset always reminds me of you</i>

476
00:53:42,378 --> 00:53:44,218
Got a light?

477
00:53:53,018 --> 00:53:54,698
Thanks.

478
00:53:57,258 --> 00:54:02,578
- Been singing for long?
- A few years now.

479
00:54:03,338 --> 00:54:07,618
I wish you were singing after dinner
too. I can't stand that horny asshole.

480
00:54:08,018 --> 00:54:10,336
But I screwed up.

481
00:54:10,378 --> 00:54:11,858
No, it was all right.

482
00:54:12,578 --> 00:54:15,058
Where did you sing before?

483
00:54:15,898 --> 00:54:19,458
- I wasn't in Tehran.
- Ah, so you're a newbie here.

484
00:54:19,618 --> 00:54:20,658
Yeah.

485
00:54:20,818 --> 00:54:25,058
- Niloufar! Can you come for a second?
- Coming.

486
00:54:25,738 --> 00:54:30,018
-I'm Niloufar. Nice to meet you
-I'm Vahid.

487
00:54:30,338 --> 00:54:32,698
Are you singing on Tuesday too?

488
00:54:35,458 --> 00:54:36,698
I am.

489
00:54:36,818 --> 00:54:40,378
Great. I'll see you then! Thanks!

490
00:54:46,778 --> 00:54:49,698
Can I sing on Tuesday too?

491
00:54:52,058 --> 00:54:55,858
At dinner. Just like tonight.

492
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:04,098
And I don't want money.
Just like tonight.

493
00:55:06,778 --> 00:55:09,578
- OK, come.
- Thanks!

494
00:55:10,178 --> 00:55:11,578
Listen!

495
00:55:12,018 --> 00:55:14,736
At least rehearse
some happy songs with Mohsen.

496
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:16,058
I will.

497
00:55:16,618 --> 00:55:18,618
And fix those trousers.

498
00:55:40,058 --> 00:55:41,698
Hi.

499
00:55:43,458 --> 00:55:45,778
- How are you?
- Hi.

500
00:55:46,898 --> 00:55:48,858
We met last week at the clinic.

501
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:51,296
I was a bit early.

502
00:55:51,338 --> 00:55:54,178
Yes, of course. Sorry, I didn't
recognize you for one second.

503
00:55:54,298 --> 00:55:56,216
No worries. You see so many people

504
00:55:56,258 --> 00:55:58,298
at work every day. It's only natural.

505
00:55:58,498 --> 00:56:03,576
I just saw you and thought I should
say hi. Didn't mean to disturb you.

506
00:56:03,618 --> 00:56:05,538
No, it's OK.

507
00:56:05,658 --> 00:56:07,416
Nice seeing you.

508
00:56:07,458 --> 00:56:08,818
You too.

509
00:56:09,538 --> 00:56:12,616
My next appointment is next week.
I'll see you then.

510
00:56:12,658 --> 00:56:13,658
Sure.

511
00:56:13,778 --> 00:56:16,416
Have a good day.

512
00:56:16,458 --> 00:56:18,818
Thanks, you too.

513
00:56:58,858 --> 00:57:00,698
Hello?

514
00:57:02,178 --> 00:57:06,376
Hi. Sorry, I think I might have
the wrong number.

515
00:57:06,418 --> 00:57:09,218
I was looking for Sohrab.

516
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:15,218
Can I speak to him?

517
00:57:15,778 --> 00:57:16,818
This is...

518
00:57:17,418 --> 00:57:19,578
Mina Shams.

519
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:26,856
Hi, Sohrab! How are you?
It's Mina. From the clinic.

520
00:57:26,898 --> 00:57:29,778
We saw each other at the café today.

521
00:57:29,898 --> 00:57:32,098
I'm good, thanks.

522
00:57:33,258 --> 00:57:36,338
Sorry if I called at a bad time.

523
00:57:40,818 --> 00:57:42,698
Your wife...

524
00:57:43,298 --> 00:57:47,698
No, I just wanted to remind you
of your next appointment.

525
00:57:47,818 --> 00:57:49,138
Yes.

526
00:57:49,378 --> 00:57:51,298
Tuesday at 3 p.m.

527
00:57:52,378 --> 00:57:55,058
Thanks. Bye.

528
00:58:43,578 --> 00:58:48,258
The director insists you watch
these carefully.

529
00:58:48,418 --> 00:58:50,096
Louis Garrel is in a couple of them.

530
00:58:50,138 --> 00:58:53,858
Watch them to familiarize
yourself with him.

531
00:58:54,218 --> 00:58:57,178
- When is he coming?
- Louis Garrel?

532
00:58:57,298 --> 00:58:58,898
He's not coming.

533
00:58:59,178 --> 00:59:00,296
I mean the director.

534
00:59:00,338 --> 00:59:03,056
He'll arrive
in the next couple of days.

535
00:59:03,098 --> 00:59:05,858
We start rehearsals next week.

536
00:59:06,818 --> 00:59:09,456
Do you know the schedule
for rehearsals?

537
00:59:09,498 --> 00:59:11,858
It's five days a week.

538
00:59:12,418 --> 00:59:16,616
- Five days full time?
- Yes.

539
00:59:16,658 --> 00:59:19,698
And shooting is definitely next month?

540
00:59:20,218 --> 00:59:25,978
Yes. I told you all this already!
It's next month.

541
00:59:27,298 --> 00:59:28,858
Is anything wrong?

542
00:59:30,418 --> 00:59:31,778
No.

543
00:59:34,578 --> 00:59:36,618
No, Mum!

544
00:59:37,538 --> 00:59:42,218
Arezou isn't coming back
any time soon.

545
00:59:42,578 --> 00:59:48,178
How can we talk about marriage
when her grandfather is so ill!

546
00:59:48,458 --> 00:59:51,018
OK. I'll let you know.

547
00:59:51,978 --> 00:59:53,978
Haj Agha is well too.

548
00:59:55,498 --> 00:59:56,858
Bye.

549
01:00:10,978 --> 01:00:13,576
Go take it off.
It'll be ready tomorrow.

550
01:00:13,618 --> 01:00:14,978
I want it today.

551
01:00:15,498 --> 01:00:18,778
- It will cost you.
- I'll pay.

552
01:00:30,498 --> 01:00:32,898
Hi. I have an appointment at 1 p.m.

553
01:00:33,018 --> 01:00:34,096
You are?

554
01:00:34,138 --> 01:00:35,858
Hessam Fazli.

555
01:00:37,778 --> 01:00:40,258
You don't have an appointment today.

556
01:00:40,658 --> 01:00:46,738
I was here last week.
You gave me the appointment yourself.

557
01:00:49,058 --> 01:00:51,778
It's for tomorrow. Not today.

558
01:00:52,098 --> 01:00:56,498
I swear you said today!
I put it straight into my phone.

559
01:00:56,698 --> 01:00:58,898
You must have made a mistake.

560
01:00:59,338 --> 01:01:01,576
No, miss! I think the mistake
was made somewhere else.

561
01:01:01,618 --> 01:01:03,418
I'm sure it was for today.

562
01:01:06,218 --> 01:01:10,256
Mr Fazli! I tried writing your
appointment down on the card for you.

563
01:01:10,298 --> 01:01:12,578
You said you prefer it on your phone.

564
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:17,418
Take this to avoid any
further confusion.

565
01:01:17,578 --> 01:01:20,416
But I don't know
if I can make it tomorrow.

566
01:01:20,458 --> 01:01:22,738
Would you like to change it then?

567
01:01:23,738 --> 01:01:26,616
No. I'll call you if I can't make it.

568
01:01:26,658 --> 01:01:28,418
As you wish.

569
01:01:44,458 --> 01:01:46,816
Yes. They're good.

570
01:01:46,858 --> 01:01:48,818
Don't worry, Mohsen,
we'll figure it out.

571
01:01:49,898 --> 01:01:52,978
Just please practice that song
I told you about for tonight.

572
01:01:55,258 --> 01:01:58,018
Look, I have to go now.
I'll see you tonight.

573
01:01:58,818 --> 01:02:01,218
Oh! Which hospital?

574
01:02:02,898 --> 01:02:07,018
I'm at work till 6 p.m.
I'll come right after.

575
01:02:07,178 --> 01:02:08,898
OK. Bye.

576
01:02:09,658 --> 01:02:12,256
Where are you going at 6 p.m.?

577
01:02:12,298 --> 01:02:14,176
We got another one at 7 p.m.!

578
01:02:14,218 --> 01:02:16,978
My friend had an accident.
He's in hospital.

579
01:02:17,098 --> 01:02:19,898
His family... live out of town.

580
01:02:20,138 --> 01:02:22,296
So again,
you're not performing tonight?

581
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:25,858
I'm here for the next one.
But I'm sorry about tonight.

582
01:02:26,018 --> 01:02:28,416
I'll arrange for Sajjad to replace me.

583
01:02:28,458 --> 01:02:31,776
The next one is an 86-year-old man.

584
01:02:31,818 --> 01:02:33,898
Tonight's is a teenage cancer case.

585
01:02:34,018 --> 01:02:37,898
I wanted you to sing for that.

586
01:03:06,698 --> 01:03:08,656
Open your fingers.

587
01:03:08,698 --> 01:03:10,416
Use your thumb as a pivot.

588
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:13,656
Bit further up. Good.

589
01:03:13,698 --> 01:03:16,898
Aim at the middle of the white ball
and hit to the left of the red one.

590
01:03:17,018 --> 01:03:22,658
You should only move
from the elbow down. Let's try.

591
01:03:22,858 --> 01:03:26,816
Pretty good. You'll slowly get better.
You want to give it another go?

592
01:03:26,858 --> 01:03:28,016
Let's do it.

593
01:03:28,058 --> 01:03:30,658
- Arshia, shall we start?
- One sec.

594
01:03:30,778 --> 01:03:33,336
I'll play a set with the guys.
Then I'll practice with you.

595
01:03:33,378 --> 01:03:36,416
Sure, go ahead. I'll watch and learn.

596
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:37,818
Sorry.

597
01:03:39,778 --> 01:03:41,416
Shall I break?

598
01:03:41,458 --> 01:03:42,578
Go ahead.

599
01:03:47,178 --> 01:03:52,218
We should never confuse
self-love with selfishness.

600
01:03:52,378 --> 01:03:56,298
What we mean by self-love is
one's responsibility towards oneself.

601
01:03:56,658 --> 01:03:59,776
It's only when we love ourselves

602
01:03:59,818 --> 01:04:03,098
that we are able
to share this love with others.

603
01:04:03,258 --> 01:04:07,138
Now, everyone close your eyes.

604
01:04:08,378 --> 01:04:10,258
Concentrate.

605
01:04:12,658 --> 01:04:17,378
Now think of something
you've done recently.

606
01:04:17,658 --> 01:04:24,258
And see if you have done it
out of self-love or selfishness.

607
01:04:26,618 --> 01:04:29,658
Open your eyes. Go ahead, Reza!

608
01:04:31,178 --> 01:04:36,818
I've done something recently which
has changed people's opinion of me.

609
01:04:37,458 --> 01:04:40,018
I put my mum in a nursing home.

610
01:04:44,578 --> 01:04:46,736
Most people think of it
as a selfish act.

611
01:04:46,778 --> 01:04:49,298
And I hurt myself for years
thinking the same.

612
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:52,256
But we got to a point where
both our lives were being destroyed.

613
01:04:52,298 --> 01:04:53,696
That's why I think...

614
01:04:53,738 --> 01:04:58,576
Thanks, Reza.
Very interesting example.

615
01:04:58,618 --> 01:05:02,496
Now I want each of you to think
and say what would you've done

616
01:05:02,538 --> 01:05:03,978
if you were in Reza's shoes?

617
01:05:10,058 --> 01:05:11,778
Go ahead, Mina!

618
01:05:25,898 --> 01:05:28,658
Mina! Excuse me!

619
01:05:29,898 --> 01:05:31,176
I just wanted to say.

620
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:34,098
You were the only one who understood
where I was coming from.

621
01:05:34,218 --> 01:05:38,296
- I was very touched.
- I only said what I thought.

622
01:05:38,338 --> 01:05:40,538
That's what I mean.

623
01:05:40,898 --> 01:05:44,778
I'd love to know what you think
about other things too.

624
01:05:44,898 --> 01:05:46,336
Like what?

625
01:05:46,378 --> 01:05:47,538
Many things!

626
01:05:47,698 --> 01:05:52,978
Let me give you my number.
Maybe we can talk a little more.

627
01:06:08,858 --> 01:06:10,216
One more game?

628
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:11,738
Let's do it!

629
01:06:15,498 --> 01:06:17,296
Now that we're going
to train together full time,

630
01:06:17,338 --> 01:06:19,056
you have to be careful
with your sleeping pattern.

631
01:06:19,098 --> 01:06:21,136
Your body needs eight hours
of sleep per day.

632
01:06:21,178 --> 01:06:23,178
Yeah, man, I'll be careful.

633
01:06:23,298 --> 01:06:25,096
I've already adjusted
my work schedule.

634
01:06:25,138 --> 01:06:26,336
I want to give this my all

635
01:06:26,378 --> 01:06:27,696
until the championships.

636
01:06:27,738 --> 01:06:31,298
I'll tell my family
not to bother me as well.

637
01:06:31,418 --> 01:06:35,978
- Are you married?
- No! I meant my parents.

638
01:06:36,298 --> 01:06:39,538
Good. You can focus better that way.

639
01:06:40,778 --> 01:06:43,658
What about you? You married?

640
01:06:44,298 --> 01:06:47,298
I've been divorced for a few years.

641
01:06:57,018 --> 01:06:58,658
Thanks for the ride, again.

642
01:06:58,701 --> 01:07:01,416
Don't mention it. We should get used
to seeing more of each other.

643
01:07:01,458 --> 01:07:05,216
- We're going for the gold, man!
- One hundred percent.

644
01:07:05,258 --> 01:07:09,016
If you just tell me about your fees,
we'd be all set.

645
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:11,138
No rush. We'll deal with that later.

646
01:07:11,258 --> 01:07:13,538
- See you tomorrow.
- Good night.

647
01:07:41,698 --> 01:07:44,096
<i>Oh, my beloved and beautiful</i>

648
01:07:44,138 --> 01:07:46,498
<i>My Niloufar!</i>

649
01:07:46,778 --> 01:07:51,498
<i>You're asleep in your sweet dreams
My Niloufar!</i>

650
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:56,418
<i>You're asleep in your bed all alone</i>

651
01:07:56,738 --> 01:08:01,496
<i>You've left me and my heart
in solitude</i>

652
01:08:01,538 --> 01:08:05,738
<i>Lady of the desert Oh, Niloufar!</i>

653
01:08:05,858 --> 01:08:11,258
<i>Oh, Niloufar! Oh, Niloufar!</i>

654
01:08:20,698 --> 01:08:24,018
Impeccable song choice tonight!

655
01:08:28,578 --> 01:08:33,578
- You sing at private weddings too?
- Not yet.

656
01:08:34,058 --> 01:08:37,738
I work with this private venue
out of town.

657
01:08:37,898 --> 01:08:40,898
If you want, I can try and see
if they'll hire you.

658
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:45,018
They don't have a singer?

659
01:08:45,818 --> 01:08:50,138
They did.
But I don't know what happened to him.

660
01:08:50,258 --> 01:08:54,458
They were looking for one
up until yesterday.

661
01:08:54,898 --> 01:08:57,418
Sure. No problem.

662
01:08:58,898 --> 01:09:05,658
I'll call them and let you know.
Give me your number.

663
01:09:10,898 --> 01:09:12,378
That's me.

664
01:09:14,298 --> 01:09:16,218
I'll give you a missed call.

665
01:09:27,138 --> 01:09:29,418
Hurry up! It just started.

666
01:09:31,578 --> 01:09:33,858
I got work to do.

667
01:09:37,618 --> 01:09:40,536
Auntie Behdokht invited us
for dinner tomorrow.

668
01:09:40,578 --> 01:09:44,496
How many times do I have to say it?
I don't like that pizza guy!

669
01:09:44,538 --> 01:09:47,418
Just see him once, at home!

670
01:09:47,658 --> 01:09:50,578
You can talk to him
in a relaxed environment.

671
01:09:51,098 --> 01:09:56,858
I have nothing to say to him.
I'm going to get ice cream.

672
01:10:25,378 --> 01:10:26,898
Hi, Reza!

673
01:11:10,258 --> 01:11:12,336
The director is arriving tomorrow!

674
01:11:12,378 --> 01:11:14,378
What do I say to him?

675
01:11:14,824 --> 01:11:16,816
It's out of my hands. I have to train
someone for a competition.

676
01:11:16,858 --> 01:11:22,498
It's taking up all my time.
I did my best to make it work.

677
01:11:22,818 --> 01:11:24,176
But you can't do this!

678
01:11:24,218 --> 01:11:26,378
You've signed a contract!

679
01:11:26,738 --> 01:11:28,096
I know. And I'm sorry.

680
01:11:28,138 --> 01:11:31,898
Trust me.
This is not how I usually do business.

681
01:11:32,338 --> 01:11:34,336
And I'm letting you know
the moment I found out.

682
01:11:34,378 --> 01:11:36,178
So I don't waste your time.

683
01:13:06,378 --> 01:13:09,578
- Do you have a keyboard player?
- I do.

684
01:13:09,698 --> 01:13:12,856
Good. I've booked a DJ for tomorrow.

685
01:13:12,898 --> 01:13:15,736
But since Niloufar referred you,

686
01:13:15,778 --> 01:13:18,496
I'll let you sing after dinner
and we'll see how it goes.

687
01:13:18,538 --> 01:13:19,538
Thanks.

688
01:13:19,658 --> 01:13:21,658
OK, let's hear it.

689
01:13:24,698 --> 01:13:27,138
Light it up, guys!

690
01:13:40,738 --> 01:13:43,456
I doubt I'll make it to retirement.

691
01:13:43,498 --> 01:13:45,416
There's so much stress
in our line of work,

692
01:13:45,458 --> 01:13:46,898
people suddenly give up and go.

693
01:13:47,018 --> 01:13:51,098
Just last week, someone suddenly left
to open a café in Laos.

694
01:13:51,258 --> 01:13:55,578
- Where?
- Laos. Vang Vieng.

695
01:13:57,418 --> 01:13:59,018
Now it's your turn.

696
01:13:59,138 --> 01:14:03,138
After five years in this job,
nothing surprises me any more.

697
01:14:03,298 --> 01:14:05,498
Come on!
What's the weirdest thing you've seen?

698
01:14:08,298 --> 01:14:11,456
There was this woman in her 60s
who brought her cat's picture

699
01:14:11,498 --> 01:14:14,376
and wanted to make herself
look like the cat.

700
01:14:14,418 --> 01:14:15,536
Is that even possible?

701
01:14:15,578 --> 01:14:16,738
It was.

702
01:14:16,858 --> 01:14:19,618
But by the time all her surgeries
were done, she died.

703
01:14:19,738 --> 01:14:22,416
- The woman?
- The cat.

704
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:23,496
You're joking?

705
01:14:23,538 --> 01:14:24,656
I'm serious.

706
01:14:24,698 --> 01:14:26,698
Desert menus.

707
01:14:30,818 --> 01:14:35,736
My neck is so sore from sitting behind
the computer all the time.

708
01:14:35,778 --> 01:14:38,098
Shall we have ice cream?

709
01:14:48,658 --> 01:14:50,616
One, two, three, four.

710
01:14:50,658 --> 01:14:54,416
<i>The city is full of light and stars</i>

711
01:14:54,458 --> 01:14:58,056
<i>Lovers' dreams are all coming true</i>

712
01:14:58,098 --> 01:15:00,378
<i>What a beautiful...</i>

713
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:04,536
Vahid, you need to be more energetic
for these private mixed weddings.

714
01:15:04,578 --> 01:15:06,416
You're singing for a bunch of
men and women

715
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:08,456
dancing and jumping up and down.

716
01:15:08,498 --> 01:15:10,136
It's not like "legal" weddings

717
01:15:10,178 --> 01:15:13,776
with a bunch of grumpy old men
stuffing their faces with food.

718
01:15:13,818 --> 01:15:16,736
Have you done this type
of wedding before?

719
01:15:16,778 --> 01:15:18,416
That's how I started.

720
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:21,776
But then it got complicated
so I stopped doing them.

721
01:15:21,818 --> 01:15:26,496
- What happened?
- Nothing. It's stupid.

722
01:15:26,538 --> 01:15:30,018
Listen, it'll help if you stand up.

723
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:37,898
OK, now imagine the room is filled
with people dancing and screaming.

724
01:15:38,018 --> 01:15:39,658
Lights going on and off.

725
01:15:39,978 --> 01:15:42,538
Lots of energy.
Ready?

726
01:15:42,698 --> 01:15:44,576
One, two, three, four.

727
01:15:44,618 --> 01:15:48,498
<i>The city is full of light and stars</i>

728
01:15:48,618 --> 01:15:52,216
<i>Lovers' dreams are all coming true</i>

729
01:15:52,258 --> 01:15:55,978
<i>What a beautiful night</i>

730
01:16:01,738 --> 01:16:05,098
He's a bit provincial,
but he's so sweet.

731
01:16:05,218 --> 01:16:06,696
The second time he saw me,

732
01:16:06,738 --> 01:16:09,336
he performed <i>Niloufar </i>on stage
in front of everyone.

733
01:16:09,378 --> 01:16:11,338
Can you imagine?

734
01:16:12,258 --> 01:16:15,778
Keep going. There's some more.

735
01:16:17,458 --> 01:16:21,576
I'm helping him get into the
private weddings business too.

736
01:16:21,618 --> 01:16:28,458
Poor guy is a beginner.
I felt sorry for him.

737
01:16:29,498 --> 01:16:33,058
I met someone too.

738
01:16:33,218 --> 01:16:37,096
Who? Where?
Why didn't you say anything?

739
01:16:37,138 --> 01:16:39,176
We met in this class I go to.

740
01:16:39,218 --> 01:16:42,056
What class? Is he nice?
What does he do?

741
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:46,178
He's nice. He's in I.T. and stuff.

742
01:16:46,418 --> 01:16:49,458
Nice! Finally someone you approve of.

743
01:16:49,658 --> 01:16:53,376
You've got to tell me all about it.
But guess who called today?

744
01:16:53,418 --> 01:16:56,018
- Who?
- My lawyer!

745
01:16:56,338 --> 01:16:58,858
My visa is here!

746
01:17:00,018 --> 01:17:02,418
Nice.

747
01:17:03,658 --> 01:17:05,536
So you're leaving for real...

748
01:17:05,578 --> 01:17:09,536
Yeah. By the end
of the month, I think.

749
01:17:09,578 --> 01:17:12,576
I'll miss you so much.

750
01:17:12,618 --> 01:17:14,338
Wish you could come with me.

751
01:17:15,418 --> 01:17:18,656
But we'll hang out a lot
before I leave.

752
01:17:18,698 --> 01:17:21,338
You just wait here in the car.

753
01:17:21,498 --> 01:17:26,298
I'll be back in a second.

754
01:17:44,418 --> 01:17:46,298
Two more...

755
01:17:46,578 --> 01:17:49,098
- One...
- One more...

756
01:17:49,818 --> 01:17:51,258
Two.

757
01:17:53,978 --> 01:17:56,656
I've got some DVDs
from the European championships.

758
01:17:56,698 --> 01:17:58,656
We can watch them together
at my place tonight.

759
01:17:58,698 --> 01:18:01,376
I can explain some of
the techniques to you.

760
01:18:01,418 --> 01:18:02,616
Sure. Thanks.

761
01:18:02,658 --> 01:18:04,098
It'll be good for you.

762
01:18:31,138 --> 01:18:33,618
I'm off to bed.

763
01:18:34,778 --> 01:18:36,858
Good night, Mr Fazli.

764
01:19:54,618 --> 01:19:56,898
- Thanks.
- Sorry again.

765
01:19:57,018 --> 01:19:59,618
I have to be somewhere, otherwise
we'd stay together until dinner.

766
01:20:03,458 --> 01:20:05,258
We'll speak later tonight.

767
01:20:06,538 --> 01:20:07,538
OK.

768
01:20:12,098 --> 01:20:13,658
See you.

769
01:21:09,858 --> 01:21:14,458
Hello? Hi, Reza. How are you, baby?

770
01:21:14,658 --> 01:21:16,978
It's Sara.

771
01:21:17,498 --> 01:21:20,098
You don't remember me?

772
01:21:21,138 --> 01:21:24,858
I'm not going to remind you then.

773
01:21:25,498 --> 01:21:31,058
But if you want, we can meet up
and I can refresh your memory.

774
01:21:31,298 --> 01:21:33,658
How rude!

775
01:21:34,378 --> 01:21:37,818
Just say you're not interested.

776
01:21:38,338 --> 01:21:39,658
Hello?

777
01:21:40,698 --> 01:21:42,618
Hello?

778
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:44,178
Hello?

779
01:22:25,218 --> 01:22:28,498
Hello? Hi, Arshia.

780
01:22:28,738 --> 01:22:30,138
You OK?

781
01:22:30,498 --> 01:22:33,138
Where are you? You're not coming?

782
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:35,858
Oh.

783
01:22:37,098 --> 01:22:39,658
Yeah, let's meet when you can.

784
01:22:41,138 --> 01:22:46,418
By the way, I was comparing your last
measurements with when you started.

785
01:22:46,538 --> 01:22:48,738
You've come a long way!

786
01:22:51,778 --> 01:22:54,738
OK. I'll see you soon.

787
01:23:02,818 --> 01:23:06,496
<i>Bride, kiss the groom, yalla!</i>

788
01:23:06,538 --> 01:23:10,136
<i>We want a kiss, yalla! Yalla!</i>

789
01:23:10,178 --> 01:23:13,856
<i>We want a kiss, yalla! Yalla!</i>

790
01:23:13,898 --> 01:23:17,538
<i>We want a kiss, yalla! Yalla!</i>

791
01:23:17,658 --> 01:23:20,858
<i>We want a kiss, yalla! Yalla!</i>

792
01:23:20,978 --> 01:23:24,858
<i>Mashallah! </i>Give it up for the bride!

793
01:23:24,978 --> 01:23:27,858
Now it's the groom's turn!

794
01:23:27,978 --> 01:23:33,338
Thank you all for coming, We
have a special guest among us tonight.

795
01:23:33,458 --> 01:23:37,138
Now for the groom.

796
01:23:38,058 --> 01:23:41,856
<i>Groom, kiss the bride, yalla!</i>

797
01:23:41,898 --> 01:23:45,776
<i>Groom, kiss the bride, yalla!</i>

798
01:23:45,818 --> 01:23:49,456
<i>Groom, kiss the bride, yalla!</i>

799
01:23:49,498 --> 01:23:53,216
<i>Give her an artistic kiss, yalla!</i>

800
01:23:53,258 --> 01:23:56,218
<i>Give her an artistic kiss, yalla!</i>

801
01:25:01,418 --> 01:25:04,098
You really want to give up?

802
01:25:04,778 --> 01:25:09,816
I swear I wouldn't if I could.
But it's out of my hands.

803
01:25:09,858 --> 01:25:11,696
It'd be such a pity.

804
01:25:11,738 --> 01:25:14,298
You know how much I wanted this.

805
01:25:14,778 --> 01:25:18,898
But I can't focus
until I sort things out.

806
01:25:19,058 --> 01:25:24,658
We can do late nights too.
If that helps.

807
01:25:25,098 --> 01:25:27,818
I can arrange it with the gym manager.

808
01:25:28,898 --> 01:25:32,296
That's nice of you.
But there's no way.

809
01:25:32,338 --> 01:25:34,496
It's not the time that's the issue.

810
01:25:34,538 --> 01:25:39,816
I just have to go on these work trips.
A few weeks in Europe, then China.

811
01:25:39,858 --> 01:25:42,418
I don't want to waste your time.

812
01:26:21,498 --> 01:26:23,418
Can I get you anything else?

813
01:27:32,578 --> 01:27:37,018
Thank you so much, Haj Agha.
You were so kind.

814
01:27:37,138 --> 01:27:43,098
Vahid was too ashamed so
I took the liberty to call you myself.

815
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:46,016
He is really lucky to have you.

816
01:27:46,058 --> 01:27:50,138
God willing
they've learnt their lesson.

817
01:27:50,338 --> 01:27:53,016
And I hope to see more of you
at the mosque.

818
01:27:53,058 --> 01:27:54,978
Certainly, sir.

819
01:27:56,458 --> 01:28:01,018
Be at the mosque at 5 p.m. sharp.
We need to talk.

820
01:28:01,178 --> 01:28:04,138
I haven't mentioned anything
to your dad yet.

821
01:28:04,978 --> 01:28:07,218
Yes, sir.

822
01:28:07,338 --> 01:28:10,898
And you go find yourself a decent job!

823
01:28:19,978 --> 01:28:22,738
Hello? Hi, Niloufar.

824
01:28:23,498 --> 01:28:27,418
Yes, a friend managed to get us out.

825
01:28:29,018 --> 01:28:33,298
No worries. It wasn't your fault.

826
01:28:35,818 --> 01:28:40,016
Thank you. I just...
I was wondering...

827
01:28:40,058 --> 01:28:43,298
If it's possible for us to meet?

828
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:49,778
I need to talk to you.

829
01:29:27,658 --> 01:29:29,418
Open it!

830
01:29:41,138 --> 01:29:43,016
Thanks!
So thoughtful of you!

831
01:29:43,058 --> 01:29:47,698
For your neck.
I thought it'd be useful.

832
01:29:51,058 --> 01:29:53,898
- Mina, dear.
- Yes?

833
01:29:54,618 --> 01:29:55,978
I...

834
01:29:57,258 --> 01:29:59,178
I'm a married man, with a son.

835
01:30:01,058 --> 01:30:03,256
I mean, we are not together any more.

836
01:30:03,298 --> 01:30:07,656
The legal process of the divorce
is taking too long.

837
01:30:07,698 --> 01:30:10,538
But I wanted you to know,
before we go any further.

838
01:30:23,818 --> 01:30:26,978
A deluxe double ice cream, please.

839
01:30:27,258 --> 01:30:32,498
- Sure. And you?
- I'm OK. Thanks.

840
01:30:48,098 --> 01:30:50,216
How old is he?

841
01:30:50,258 --> 01:30:52,778
Abtin? He's five.

842
01:31:13,498 --> 01:31:16,138
I was never a wedding singer.

843
01:31:16,778 --> 01:31:20,378
Really? What were you then?

844
01:31:20,898 --> 01:31:24,538
I performed at funerals. At a mosque.

845
01:31:24,738 --> 01:31:25,856
You're serious?

846
01:31:25,898 --> 01:31:29,898
Yes. Sorry, I should've
told you sooner.

847
01:31:30,058 --> 01:31:31,738
It just never came up.

848
01:31:31,898 --> 01:31:34,978
What were you doing
at the wedding then?

849
01:31:35,138 --> 01:31:40,778
I was depressed
and was looking for a change.

850
01:31:41,378 --> 01:31:45,898
I could hear the sorrow in your voice.

851
01:31:47,018 --> 01:31:49,416
You tried to be happy for once
and look what happened.

852
01:31:49,458 --> 01:31:53,178
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's OK.

853
01:31:53,978 --> 01:31:56,096
I mean now...

854
01:31:56,138 --> 01:31:58,736
The reality is...

855
01:31:58,778 --> 01:32:01,618
My real happiness is in seeing you.

856
01:32:07,578 --> 01:32:09,698
You're sweet.

857
01:32:12,378 --> 01:32:15,618
I'm leaving Iran in two weeks.

858
01:32:16,218 --> 01:32:20,178
- Where to?
- Australia.

859
01:32:36,178 --> 01:32:37,178
Vahid!

860
01:32:45,498 --> 01:32:51,818
These are a couple of photos from the
wedding. Keep them as souvenir.

861
01:32:55,538 --> 01:33:00,538
- Can I give you a ride?
- Thanks. I'm OK.

862
01:33:01,058 --> 01:33:04,618
- OK. Take care of yourself.
- You too.

863
01:33:04,898 --> 01:33:06,778
Bon voyage.

864
01:33:37,178 --> 01:33:40,458
It's such a shame your schedule
didn't work with Arshia's.

865
01:33:40,578 --> 01:33:42,738
I didn't know you were so busy!

866
01:33:43,258 --> 01:33:49,218
He was lucky to find another
trainer so quickly.

867
01:33:49,338 --> 01:33:52,218
I hope he makes it to the competition.

868
01:33:52,898 --> 01:33:55,818
He really wants to be champion.

869
01:33:57,458 --> 01:34:01,618
- How many more?
- Four more.

870
01:34:55,658 --> 01:34:58,216
PROFESSIONAL BODYBUILDING COACH

871
01:34:58,258 --> 01:35:00,898
HESSAM FAZLI
THREE-TIME CHAMPION

872
01:35:25,578 --> 01:35:28,378
I want to change jobs, Haj Agha.

873
01:35:29,618 --> 01:35:32,696
What do you mean? You don't want
to work here any more?

874
01:35:32,738 --> 01:35:33,738
Yes.

875
01:35:35,538 --> 01:35:37,898
What do you want to do then?

876
01:35:38,418 --> 01:35:40,738
I'm not sure yet.

877
01:35:43,218 --> 01:35:45,618
And your father...

878
01:35:45,738 --> 01:35:51,218
- What are you going to tell him?
- I don't know.

879
01:35:52,498 --> 01:35:53,778
Very well then...

880
01:35:56,138 --> 01:35:58,296
You're asking me to tell
my dear friend of 30 years

881
01:35:58,338 --> 01:36:01,016
that the son he's entrusted to me
all these years

882
01:36:01,058 --> 01:36:04,696
has decided to become
a jester and an entertainer,

883
01:36:04,738 --> 01:36:07,778
- and I let him get away with it?
- Yes.

884
01:36:41,578 --> 01:36:43,338
Ms Shams?
