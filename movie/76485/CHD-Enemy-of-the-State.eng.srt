1
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,757
Come on.

2
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:54,136
Come on, mutt.
Now, look at that ball. All right.

3
00:00:54,303 --> 00:00:56,514
Come on. Get that ball. Ah-

4
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,350
There's no problem with that.

5
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,602
Oh, God damn it.

6
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:07,525
- If it happens, let me know.
- What the hell are you doing here?
This is not the office.

7
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:10,820
- This is my private time.
- Five minutes.

8
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,698
No- I said no Tuesday,
I said no last week...

9
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,616
and I'm gonna keep sayin' no
till you hear me.

10
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:18,494
Five minutes, Mr Chairman.

11
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,581
It's all I ask-- five minutes.

12
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:24,083
- Want some coffee?
- No, I don't want any coffee.

13
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,627
I want to play with my dog.

14
00:01:26,794 --> 00:01:29,672
Look, I'm not asking you
to vote for it.

15
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,508
I know you can't.
Just release your people.

16
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:35,553
Let them go the way they want.

17
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,724
Telecommunications
Security and Privacy Act-

18
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,268
Invasion of privacy is more like it.

19
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:47,148
You read the Post?
"This bill is not the first step
toward the surveillance society.

20
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,275
It is the surveillance society."

21
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,278
- Uh, liberal hysteria.
- Oh, listen.
I'm not gonna sit in Congress...

22
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,488
and pass a law
that lets the government...

23
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:57,992
point a camera and a microphone
at anything they damn well please.

24
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:03,414
Phil, look.
I don't care who bangs who...

25
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,625
what cabinet officers get stoned.

26
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:09,378
But this is the richest,
most powerful nation on Earth,
and therefore the most hated.

27
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:11,964
And you and I know
what the average citizen does not:

28
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:14,717
that we are at war
24 hours of every day.

29
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,386
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30
00:02:17,553 --> 00:02:20,139
Do I have to itemize the number
of American lives we've saved...

31
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:24,310
in the past 12 months alone
with judicious use
of surveillance intelligence?

32
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:28,147
Thomas, cut the crap.
I've got three major employers...

33
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:32,652
in the Syracuse area alone who are
gonna get just killed by this bill.

34
00:02:34,278 --> 00:02:37,323
I promise to get you funds
equal to or greater than...

35
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,076
whatever those companies
gave your last campaign.

36
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,037
I'm not talking about
campaign contributions, damn it.

37
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,998
I'm talking about my constituents
being out of work.

38
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:48,334
Jesus, man- Wake up-

39
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,838
National security isn't the only thing
going on in this country.

40
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,551
God.

41
00:02:56,717 --> 00:02:59,303
This conversation is over.

42
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,182
I beg of you, Phil.
Please don't.

43
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,102
I've been there for you in the past,
haven't I? There have been times...

44
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,231
personal situations, when you needed
my assistance and my confidence.

45
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:13,860
Are you blackmailing me,
you ambitious shit?

46
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:18,531
I'm sorry we can't find a common ground
on this one, Congressman.

47
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,576
You're a good man.
People of your district are lucky...

48
00:03:21,742 --> 00:03:23,995
to have you representing them.

49
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,588
Come on. Come on.

50
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:35,590
Come on.

51
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:32,934
Let me fight management.
Okay, I can accept that.

52
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,478
But this is our own
goddamned union leadership...

53
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:39,148
tryin' to railroad us into signing
some, some sweetheart contract.

54
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,234
Look-- Look, everybody knows...

55
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,029
that, that the mob
has been controlling these guys since,
since as long as I can remember.

56
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:49,575
And now, uh-- now we got Pintero's goons
down there tuning up my people.

57
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:53,246
Well, first off, that's a Hobbs Act
violation, probably a RICO.

58
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,664
- Hey.
- How you doing, Eddie?
- Thanks.

59
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,541
- How you doin'?
- Great.
- All right.
- Thanks.

60
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,293
- Robert Dean.
- Tony O'Neill. Nice to meet you.

61
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,506
A Hobbs and a RICO.
Ooh, baby, don't stop.

62
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:08,219
Sounds like you guys need
a labour lawyer. What happened?

63
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,055
We were in Louie's two nights ago.
I go to use the bathroom...

64
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,682
and these two fuckin' guidos jump me.

65
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,686
Uh, I prefer we use the term
"Italian-Americans."

66
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,439
Eh, whatever, but they were
really goin' to work on me.
It could've gotten serious.

67
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,652
- But then Larry Cash came in
and he went after 'em.
- Uh, Larry Cash is in the hospital...

68
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,613
with a broken jaw
and a ruptured kidney.

69
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,324
Is this becoming
a criminal investigation, Robert?

70
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,035
Um, no, it would take years
to see that thing through.

71
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:36,038
Besides, these people have families
that are living through this every day.

72
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,544
Hey, Julie, can we send
a case of Chianti over to Larry Cash?

73
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,629
- Larry Cash?
- Yes, he's at St. Luke's.

74
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,924
And send some flowers to his wife,
Brenda. They're both in the Rolodex.

75
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,468
Yes, Mr Dean.

76
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,764
- Well, why don't you guys
just head on home?
- All right.

77
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:57,852
I'm your lawyer. I'm in the process of
dealing with these guido motherfuckers.

78
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,354
Pintero doesn't stand a chance.

79
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:07,528
So, how's the trout?

80
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,239
- Tastes like fish.
- It is fish.

81
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,993
No, I mean it tastes like
every other fish I've ever had.

82
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,287
Okay.

83
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:22,210
Brill's note said that this
is the videotape that you need
to convince Pintero with.

84
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:26,923
And watch out for the FBI. Brill says
the place is under surveillance.

85
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:31,135
- So when do I get to meet him?
- Pintero?

86
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,055
Brill.

87
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,682
Never.

88
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,851
Okay. Um--

89
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,687
Wow. That's not exactly
the answer I was hoping for.

90
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,940
Oh, and what was the answer
you were hoping for?

91
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:47,610
Oh, I don't know. Soon.
Uh, definitely sooner than never.

92
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,905
Bobby, why do we have to
go through this every time?

93
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:55,034
Brill talks to me, I talk to you.
That's the way it works.

94
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,245
Well, pardon me for being
a little uncomfortable...

95
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,081
with hiring someone that I don't know
and I've never even met.

96
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,625
Then don't hire him.

97
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,048
Ten thousand dollars.

98
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,468
And I'm also a little
uncomfortable havin' to carry
that kind of cash around.

99
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,512
Well, this should lighten your load.

100
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,682
I don't know if it's Brill's price
that's goin' up or your commission.

101
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,726
I take 15%, as always.

102
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,895
Brill's fee varies with risk.

103
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,731
Maybe you'd be more comfortable
using someone else.

104
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,777
- What, other than Brill?
- Other than me.

105
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,989
- What's wrong with you?
- Oh, there's nothing wrong with me.

106
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:38,327
Just, you know, someone
with whom you don't have
quite so complicated a history.

107
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,916
I like our history, and I like you.

108
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,628
I like you too.

109
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:53,301
Look, I-I just want to make sure that
I'm not breaking the law in any way.

110
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,721
- You're not.
- And how can I be so sure?

111
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,641
Because I wouldn't let you.

112
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:15,239
So, Mr Pintero, the guy on the left is
Carl Matthews, president of Local 6650.

113
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:19,202
And this is Dave Early,
secretary-treasurer of the National.

114
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,078
Oh, right there, you see--
you see the guy there?

115
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,040
Uh, that's Hugh Simic.
He administers the pension fund.

116
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:29,337
Hey, you're going to recognize
this fellow right here.

117
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,923
That's you.
Am I correct, Mr Pintero?

118
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,050
That ain't me.

119
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:37,386
Let's watch a little more of this.

120
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,556
- Take a-- Take a picture of this.
- Everybody say "money."

121
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,850
Here comes a great shot right here.

122
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,144
Wait. Everybody say "not guilty."

123
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,314
Right here; here it comes.

124
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,068
- That's not you?
- That ain't me.

125
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:55,196
Well, you know, that-that's actually
really great news for me.

126
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,074
It lifts a huge weight
off of my shoulders.

127
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:01,202
Because, you know, the conditions of
your parole specifically forbid you...

128
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:05,414
from having any contact of any kind
with any union officials.

129
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:09,168
- I know that.
- Well, I'm-- I'm saying,
so hypothetically...

130
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:13,881
had that been you, I mean,
you'd be headed back to prison for...

131
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,843
15-- I don't know--
maybe 20 years-- even more.

132
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,596
But, you know, I mean, that ain't you,
as you so eloquently put it.

133
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:25,059
Are you fuckin' with me?
Eloquently? That's not me.

134
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:29,230
Oh, that's not you. Well, I'm sorry
that I've wasted your time, gentlemen...

135
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,233
you know, since
that's not you, um--

136
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,823
Oh, you know what? I'm thinkin'.
Maybe I'll just, you know...

137
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,659
run this tape past
the federal prosecutor.

138
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,953
You know, they have
really great VCRs down there.

139
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,706
A lot of times, they can see
some things that we can't see.

140
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,542
You ain't runnin' this by nobody.

141
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,965
- What do you want?
- My clients want to vote
their contract up or down...

142
00:11:56,132 --> 00:12:00,469
as they see fit, without,
shall we say, any outside influences.

143
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,514
Okay. Sit down.

144
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,184
- No, I'm fine, thank you.
- No, you are not fine.

145
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,062
Now sit your ass down.

146
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:23,951
I would like my clients to be able
to exercise their constitutional rights.

147
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:28,039
And if that happens,
that tape will disappear forever
into my private collection...

148
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:32,543
along with the Zapruder film
and the porno from Hitler's bunker.

149
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,005
- Do you got any copies of this thing?
- Absolutely.

150
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,341
Who made it? You make it?

151
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:43,221
I'm an attorney.
I don't make videotapes.

152
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,306
Now you listen to me,
you fuckin' eggplant.

153
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,518
This fuckin' videotape
may save your clients' asses...

154
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,604
but you can be goddamned sure
it ain't gonna save yours.

155
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,274
Now, who made
the fuckin' videotape?

156
00:12:56,817 --> 00:13:00,738
- I don't know.
- How'd you get it?

157
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,200
Through an acquaintance.

158
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,495
Mr Dean, he's got acquaintances.
Me, I got friends. I don't know.

159
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,997
Vic, get outside. See if they're
any acquaintances out there...

160
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,333
that are of the black persuasion.

161
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,503
Carlos, why don't you
get out of that chair?

162
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,799
Talk to Mr Dean.

163
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,555
Who's your fucking acquaintance?

164
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,186
Listen to me. I wanna know
who made that videotape...

165
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,897
but I wanna know in a week...

166
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,567
or I'll kill ya.

167
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,489
Hey, smile.

168
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,075
- What?
- Smile for the FBI.

169
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:57,086
- Who's the brother?
- I don't know, but he doesn't
look Italian to me, does he?

170
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,756
Table Harvest to 101.
We got a blue overcoat heading east.

171
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:14,145
Give me a loose one.
See if we can get his plates.

172
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,362
I'm standing by live at the
Lockraven Reservoir right now...

173
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,365
where police and fire officials
are in the process of removing...

174
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,202
a classic Mercedes owned
by Republican Congressman...

175
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,121
Phillip Hamersly
of Syracuse, New York.

176
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,665
This accident comes
at a very untimely juncture...

177
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:39,045
since the congressman was
working on a controversial
piece of legislation, Dale...

178
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,548
opposing the Telecommunications
Security and Privacy Act.

179
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,885
Fire officials do tell me
that it appears the congressman...

180
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,012
was by himself in the car.

181
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,515
We have confirmed that.
However, strangely enough...

182
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,976
his favourite dog, Bob,
is currently with police.

183
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,853
I understand there was
a history of heart problems.

184
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,064
There was, in fact,
a history of heart problems.

185
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,692
In fact, the congressman
endured open-heart surgery
just a couple of years ago.

186
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:06,155
Homicide investigators have told me they
did find a bottle of pills in his lap.

187
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,450
That might mean that the congressman--
and I speculate here--

188
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:13,496
may have suffered a heart attack before
going into the Lockraven Reservoir.

189
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,915
He leaves behind a family of four.

190
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:19,085
We'll have more details
as the story develops.

191
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,494
I need a 10-27 on a...

192
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:57,248
brown and tan '75 GMC Jimmy.

193
00:15:57,415 --> 00:16:00,084
D.C. tags. Eight, kilo...

194
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,712
six, three, nine, four.

195
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,047
And a 10-28 on the registered owner.

196
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,237
Jake, please do not give me
optimistic numbers. I hate optimism.

197
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,906
- Sir?
- I want to know how many votes
we have in the bank...

198
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,075
aren't gonna change their mind
every time the wind blows.

199
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,828
Thank you.

200
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,539
We may have a problem
out at the lake.

201
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:42,001
This is Daniel Zavitz.
He's a nature photographer
who was in government grants.

202
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:46,797
One of them is for monitoring
migratory patterns of Canadian geese.

203
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,966
Or lack thereof.

204
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,845
The box is called a hide.
It contains a motion-activated...

205
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,348
digital video camera
with a compound lens.

206
00:16:55,515 --> 00:17:00,144
It was aimed directly
at the boat ramp across the lake.

207
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,493
We need two techs with full electronic
capabilities-- two humpty-dumpties.

208
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,913
Get Fiedler to organize it,
and call Kramer...

209
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,832
to get us some ex-military cutouts.

210
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:24,627
How do I describe the project?

211
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:30,132
Call it a training op hosted here.
Set up a link with the NRO.

212
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:33,761
- That's good.
- Falsify FBI approval.

213
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:38,099
And none of this goes beyond our team.
And get that videotape.

214
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:41,352
- Of course.
- Get a wire on our bird-watcher.

215
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,938
You got it.

216
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,526
Fiedler, it's Hicks. I need
an intercept on a Daniel Leon Zavitz.

217
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,820
202-555-0108.

218
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,406
And, uh, what's our authorization?

219
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,992
We're calling it a P-1 training op.
FBI approval.

220
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,744
Krug and Jones, sir.

221
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,165
We were with the 22nd Marine
expeditionary unit. Kramer sent us.

222
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,917
- Oh, nice haircut.
- Thirty months in
a federal penitentiary...

223
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,254
at Marion, Illinois, for a GVH-1--
on your gunnery sergeant--
what's that about?

224
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:13,134
The guy was an asshole, sir,
and he deserved it, if you'll excuse me.

225
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:24,270
All new, designed for today.

226
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:28,566
The electric car is here.

227
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,360
A sedan for you.

228
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,571
I'm standing by live
at the Lockraven Reservoir...

229
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,782
right now, where police
and fire officials are
in the process of removing...

230
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,870
a classic Mercedes owned by
Republican congressman Phillip Hamersly.

231
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,706
You may be able to see it here,
being removed in the background.

232
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,542
Now, fire and police officials
aren't saying much at this point.

233
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,712
Here's what I do know.
I have been told that the congressman...

234
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:54,300
was alone in the vehicle
when this accident happened
just under an hour ago.

235
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,345
You may know that the congressman
suffers from a heart condition.

236
00:18:57,512 --> 00:19:01,516
Homicide investigators
have told me that they did find
a bottle of pills in his lap.

237
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,977
That might mean that the congressman--
and I speculate here--

238
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,314
may have suffered a heart attack before
going into the Lockraven Reservoir.

239
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,734
I am also told that there was no one
in the car with him at the time of the--

240
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:15,071
- Fuck a duck.
- However, curiously enough,
the congressman's dog Bob--

241
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:17,448
Holy shit-

242
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,951
...on the ground,
and is currently with police.

243
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,203
He's from Syracuse, New York.

244
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,874
The congressman was a key opponent
to the Telecommunications
Security and Privacy Act.

245
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,629
- News desk.
- Lenny...

246
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:35,091
you are not going to believe
what I have in my possession.

247
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,927
- Zavitz. Long time.
- Lenny, I've got...

248
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:41,138
the Phil Hamersly murder on videotape.

249
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,599
Phil Hamersly died
of a heart attack.

250
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,978
Negative. Hamersly was professionally
wasted under the direction...

251
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:51,691
of some anal-retentive with what looks
like a serious vitamin D deficiency.

252
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:56,320
- Well, how did you get this tape?
- My conservation study at the
lake photographed the murder.

253
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,991
- You're kidding me-
- The camera was aimed
straight across at the pier...

254
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,076
right where Phil Hamersly was killed.

255
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:06,247
- How fast can you get
that tape over here?
- I'm making a copy right now.

256
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,916
Uh, Mark, I have to take this.

257
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,795
Good. Thank you.
Call if you need anything.

258
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:22,054
- Fiedler, is this line secure?
- Yes, it is, sir.
- Go ahead.

259
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,223
Zavitz is speaking
to a Lenny Bloom...

260
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,434
a former anti-war activist.

261
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:30,688
He publishes a variety
of left-wing newsletters
on various political subjects.

262
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:34,734
- He's taking the tape now
to Bloom's offices. Over.
- Put a tap on Bloom.

263
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:38,946
- And give us a dedicated
satellite for this operation.
- It's already done.

264
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:41,699
Yeah, so, Julie, I'm gonna take
the rest of the day.

265
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:45,536
Uh, finish up my Christmas shopping.
Take my mind off things.

266
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:50,458
Hey, do chicks dig lingerie?

267
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,711
All right.
I'll see you in the morning.

268
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:57,798
- Hi.
- Hi.

269
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,884
How you doin'?

270
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:02,220
Why, hello.

271
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,680
- Hi.
- Hey, hi.
- Can I help you?

272
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:08,434
- Uh, yes.
- Do you see something you like?

273
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,979
- Uh, I'm married.
- That's allowed.

274
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,440
Uh-- Uh, um, I just--
I need-- I need some...

275
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,026
uh, a-- a Christmas present.

276
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:20,404
- For your wife ?
- Yes, of-of several years.
We're ver-- We're, uh, yes.

277
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:24,700
- So you want some
lingerie for your wife?
- Yes, yes, I-I would.

278
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,078
Do you like Christian Dior?

279
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:31,999
You know, I have to be really
honest with you. Um, I'm not
really experienced in this.

280
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,836
- I don't--
- Get out of town-

281
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,797
I-I mean, don't get me wrong. I mean,
I'm-I'm experienced, you know, from--

282
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,466
- Yeah.
- from a certain perspective.
- Right.
- I-I just--

283
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:44,387
You know, I don't want to come in here
and, you know, look stupid.

284
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:46,472
Too late.

285
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,183
- Yeah. What size?
- I'm sorry?

286
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:53,187
- Oh, my wife. Oh.
- Yeah.
- Uh, she-she's, um--

287
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,857
- She's about, uh-- She--
- Size six.

288
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,276
Yeah, right, she's, uh--
She's ab-- She's a six.

289
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,528
Right. And what about cup size?

290
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:02,947
Um--

291
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:05,658
Oh- Oh, she's way bigger than that.

292
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,828
I mean, uh, not--
I mean, not noticeably.

293
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:12,331
- Oops.
- Should have gotten her a watch.

294
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,917
- So far--
- Hello?

295
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:19,630
- It's me, Ruthie.
- Shit.
- Uh, they disconnected my phone again.

296
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:23,634
Uh, mine's not working either.
I think it's a problem with the line.

297
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,679
Um--

298
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:30,600
Let me borrow some change
for the pay phone, man.

299
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,477
Come on. I gotta call Dr Mike.

300
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,652
Danny-

301
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:46,240
Danny, I always pay you back.
Come on-

302
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,618
Danny-

303
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,835
Open the door-

304
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,087
Shit. Fuck.

305
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,178
- Come on, man-
- Uh, one minute.

306
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:10,848
- I'm goin'.
- Come on, Danny-

307
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:15,102
Come on. Come on.

308
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:20,107
Oh, shit.

309
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,285
Ah, shit.
It's not working.

310
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:36,874
I got him- I got him-
He's rabbiting-

311
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:43,422
- He's out the back.
- Give me real-time imagery coverage
at LAT 38, 55, LONG 77, 00.

312
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,758
Got it. Base, this is local control.

313
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,261
Request immediate keyhole
visual tasking. Maximum resolution.

314
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,180
LAT 38, 55, LONG 77, 00. Over.

315
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:54,392
Roger that. I'll need a minute
on satellite visual. Over.

316
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,854
Run, run, Danny-
They got guns- Go-

317
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,314
- Where is he?
- He's on the roof. Right there. Go-

318
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,904
-Okay, satellite imagery coming through.
-Roger that. Patch visual, my location.

319
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,448
Confirm visual. Thank you much.
Air One, ahead.

320
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,869
All units:
Target heading north on rooftop.

321
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,997
Columbia and 18th.
Request immediate visual support. Over.

322
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:17,999
Roger that. We have visual.

323
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:34,307
Everybody move.
He just jumped to the adjacent building.

324
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:42,398
- All units,
he is entering rear entrance--
- Entering entrance of Captain Ike's.

325
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:45,568
- Captain Ike's.
- Roger.

326
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,622
Get out of the way-

327
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,046
Hey-

328
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:10,635
- Air One, be advised, suspect
heading towards front entrance.
- Front of Columbia.

329
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,179
- Detail front of building on Columbia.
- Copy that.

330
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:23,606
I got him- I got him-

331
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:27,193
All units, target
entering the barber-shop.

332
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:38,913
- Hah- Bullshit-
We lost him; we lost him.
- We've lost him-

333
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,416
- I can't--
- Units in pursuit, target seen exiting
rear of barber-shop in alley. Follow.

334
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:54,804
- Okay, I'm blank. I can't see anything.
- Air One, we've lost the visual.

335
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:57,807
- I'm blank. What do you got?
- Who's got him?

336
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:03,229
Zavitz- Dan Zavitz-

337
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:08,442
Hey, uh-- It's me, Bobby Dean. We were
at Georgetown together. You okay?

338
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,988
- Help me.
- Are you hurt?
- What do you think of this one, sir?

339
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,949
Yeah, this is Becky.
Becky, say hi.

340
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:18,536
I'm s-- Can I have one second, please?

341
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:21,289
Oh, he's right on top of Pratt.
He's running from Pratt on Connecticut.

342
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:24,750
- Pratt, he's on your 6:00. Turn around.
- Got him-

343
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,628
Move, move, move.
Get out of the way-

344
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:32,466
Hey, hey-
Come back, man- Come back-

345
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:36,095
Hey, I got him-

346
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,389
Target northbound--
northbound on Connecticut.

347
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:40,433
Okay, got him.

348
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,519
Go, go, go, go-

349
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:57,241
Switching targets. Switching.
Now heading southbound
towards DuPont circle.

350
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,754
Stop-

351
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:30,358
Target down on Connecticut Avenue.
Air One, confirm.

352
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:34,612
Target is down.
Target is down permanently.

353
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:48,709
- What happened?
- A guy on a bike got creamed.

354
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,966
Oh, Jesus.

355
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:27,165
- I'm beatin' you.
- Yeah, right.

356
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:30,626
- Oh, you are.
- Oh, sh--

357
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:33,171
- Hey, hey-
- I'm beatin' you.
- No, I'm beatin' you.

358
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:36,382
- I just caught up.
- Hello.
- Oh, yeah?
- Hi, Mr Dean.

359
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:39,093
Am I in the wrong house?

360
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,971
I'm looking for an eight-year-old boy,
about yea high.

361
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,891
- Kinda good-looking. Allegedly my son.
- No.

362
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:48,853
- Hmm. Maybe he's behind the TV.
- Eric?
- Mr Dean-
- Dad-

363
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,771
- Eric?
- Mr Dean, get out-
- Get out of the way-

364
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:53,316
What? What? Oh, I'm sorry.

365
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:56,819
- Are those my Christmas presents?
- Yep, some of 'em.

366
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:59,197
- Can I open 'em?
- Yeah, sure. Here you go.

367
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:02,575
- Seriously?
- In your dreams, buddy. Beat it.
- Dad-

368
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:05,411
- Are you staying for dinner
tonight, Dylan?
- If it's okay with you.

369
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:08,414
- Got any money?
- Money?
- He's kidding.

370
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:11,542
- I'm going to sleep over
at Dylan's, okay?
- Did you ask your mother?

371
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:14,378
I was going to, but she's
too busy yelling at the TV.

372
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:18,633
Oh, well, there goes the Fourth
Amendment-- what's left of it.

373
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,552
- Hey, Maria.
- Hello, Mr Bobby.

374
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:24,805
Don't you honestly doubt
that the average citizen--

375
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:27,642
Hey, you're about a bark-and-a-half
from being homeless.

376
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:31,395
Baby, listen to
this fascist gas bag.

377
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:34,232
- Uh-oh.
- ...and freedom have
always existed in a--

378
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:39,612
in a very precarious balance,
and when buildings start blowing up,
people's priorities tend to change.

379
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,990
- He's got a point there, sweetie.
- Bobby-

380
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:47,662
- I mean, who is this idiot?
- He is talking about ending
personal privacy.

381
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:51,916
- Do you want your phone tapped?
- I'm not plannin' on
blowing up the country.

382
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:55,503
Well, how do we know until we've heard
all your dirty little secrets?

383
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,714
You're just gonna have to trust me.

384
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:01,801
Oh, I know.
We'll just tap the criminals.

385
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:04,428
We won't suspend the civil rights
of the good people.

386
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:07,431
- Right.
- Then who decides which is which?

387
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:11,477
- I think you should.
- You know, Bobby, I think you
should take this more seriously.

388
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:14,397
Honey, I think you're taking it
seriously enough for both of us...

389
00:30:14,564 --> 00:30:17,650
and half the people on the block.

390
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,322
Tens of millions of foreign nationals
living within our borders...

391
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:26,409
and many of these people consider
the United States their enemy.

392
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:31,372
- And they see acts of terrorism as--
- You remember Daniel Zavitz?

393
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:34,333
- We were at Georgetown together?
- Vaguely.

394
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,045
- I saw him today.
- How's he doing?

395
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:40,882
- He's dead.
- What?

396
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:45,469
- He got hit by a fire engine
pretty much in front of my eyes.
- Oh, my God-

397
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:48,472
I ran into him in a store,
and he was upset about something.

398
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:50,683
- About what?
- I don't know.

399
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,895
Before we had a chance to talk about it,
he ran out of the store...

400
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:57,857
and next time I saw him,
he was dead.

401
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:00,776
Baby- Come here.

402
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:04,447
Ohh, I love you so much-

403
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:06,699
I love you, too, sweetie.

404
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:11,954
Oh, that's not even to mention
the gangster that threatened
to kill me today.

405
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:16,417
- Hah- Very funny-
- Oh, you think? Hilarious.

406
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:19,378
- Hmm. What'd you get me?
- A bowling ball.

407
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:23,799
No more of that MSNBC terrorist talk.
You're scaring the kids.

408
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:27,470
We'll be back with your phone calls for
Congressman Sam Albert right after this.

409
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:32,517
- Tell me.
- Zavitz is dead. So is Lenny,
the guy from the paper.

410
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:35,269
- What about the tape?
- We found the original
in Zavitz's apartment.

411
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:37,230
- The original?
- There was a copy.

412
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,815
- There was a copy?
- I think so, sir.
- Any more good news?

413
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:42,652
They never made it to the newspaper,
but there was a private sector contact.

414
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:44,987
- Who was that?
- Several indiscriminants
and one primary.

415
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:47,323
- Who?
- Robert Dean.
He's a D.C. Labour lawyer.

416
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:51,327
Lives in Georgetown with his wife,
Carla Dean. She's also an attorney.

417
00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:53,579
She's with the ACLU, as it happens.

418
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:56,749
Well, I suppose he could've given it
directly to Bob Woodward.

419
00:31:56,916 --> 00:32:01,462
Maybe we dodged a bullet.
Find out what Dean knows.

420
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:03,548
- Make contact.
- Yes, sir.

421
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:06,884
I hate doing this at Christmas.

422
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,807
Fiedler, we need
a complete FinCEN, EPIC...

423
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:15,184
and a DRD work-up
on a Robert Clayton Dean.

424
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:20,231
His social's 986-26-0901.
Pull up keyhole data files, okay?

425
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:23,734
Let's go-
Let's get this show on the road-

426
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:27,989
Eric, just call me in the morning
when you want me to come pick you up.

427
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:31,075
You know, if you decide
you want to stay at Dylan's
till the end of the weekend...

428
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:34,704
or the end of the century,
your mom and I have discussed it.

429
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:38,416
It'll be difficult initially,
but we think we can live with it.

430
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:41,836
Dad's kidding.
He's gonna miss you, just like me.

431
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:47,466
Honey, hurry back.
You know what that means.

432
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:50,011
Mm-hmm. That you're gonna
be asleep when I get back.

433
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:52,930
That only happened
one time, sweetie.

434
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:56,601
We're running
a comprehensive database search.

435
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:58,978
Brian did a preliminary
analysis and comparison...

436
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:02,106
and he came up with
some pretty interesting stuff.

437
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:07,445
Thanks, Brian.

438
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:10,114
Thank you.

439
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:13,409
Prioritize his phone bill.

440
00:33:13,576 --> 00:33:16,162
Who's he been calling?

441
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,291
- Oh, man. Check this one.
- Who?

442
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:24,212
Rachel F-For-You-Know-What Banks. God,
would I love to have her ruin my life.

443
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:26,672
Do a cross.

444
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:29,175
They were at Georgetown
together, sophomore year.

445
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:32,303
They have the same address,
same phone number.

446
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:36,474
They remain close.
Many calls, regardless of marriage.

447
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:38,976
- Oh, here we go.
- What?

448
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:41,854
Dean, over the past 18 months...

449
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:46,526
has four, five, seven cash
withdrawals of 4,000, 5,000...

450
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:49,111
and up, and up...

451
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,781
and each time,
the delectable Miss Banks...

452
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:54,617
makes large cash deposits
of her own within a day or two.

453
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:59,789
- Blackmail?
- Well, her deposits aren't the same,
but let me figure this out.

454
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:05,211
Ah, yes, they're exactly-- exactly
15 percent of the amount Dean withdrew.

455
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:08,381
Brian, can we get some more?

456
00:34:08,548 --> 00:34:11,926
I mean, you know, we got the blimp cam,
we got the police officer cam...

457
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:16,180
we've got, uh, two ATM cameras,
but this is the one showing promise.

458
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:19,308
This is the security camera
at the underwear store. Freeze there.

459
00:34:20,852 --> 00:34:24,313
Rotate us 75 degrees
around the vertical, please.

460
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,149
Freeze there. Times ten.

461
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:31,696
Focus on the drop.

462
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:36,701
Enhance, then forward frame-by-frame.

463
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:43,791
All right. Now, just before
the view's blocked, there's
a shape change in Dean's bag.

464
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:46,169
See the shadow variance? See?

465
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:51,007
The shadow's wrong. Zavitz changed
the configuration of Dean's packages.

466
00:34:51,174 --> 00:34:54,260
- Is it a tape?
- It's hard to say for sure.
These things are--

467
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:58,264
- Can the computer take us
around to the other side?
- It can hypothesize. Chris?

468
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:02,476
- Yeah?
- Can you rotate us 75 degrees
around the vertical, please?

469
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,525
- What do you think it is?
- It looks a lot bigger than a tape.

470
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:13,613
Zavitz had digital compression
equipment in his apartment.
He could've downloaded it to anything.

471
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,698
Or maybe the bag twisted
in Dean's hand.

472
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:19,452
Or something moved in front
of the light and altered
the shadow. Maybe it's nothing.

473
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,622
Maybe it's everything.
Let's get it and find out.

474
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:27,585
Beat it. I got work to do.

475
00:35:27,752 --> 00:35:30,588
Go. Porsche-

476
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:37,553
Go away-

477
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,222
Damn it, Porsche-

478
00:35:40,598 --> 00:35:42,850
- Hello, Mr Dean?
- Uh, yes. Can I help you?

479
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:46,979
This is Detective Benning.
I'm Pratt. We're with D.C. Metro.

480
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:50,900
Uh, sorry to bother you at home, sir.
We were just hoping to ask you
a few questions about Daniel Zavitz.

481
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:53,778
- Wh-- I'm s-- Can I see
your badges, please?
- Certainly, sir.

482
00:35:53,945 --> 00:35:56,197
Sure.

483
00:35:58,074 --> 00:36:01,369
All right. Come on.
Back up, Porsche.

484
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:06,207
- All right. Nice and smooth.
Come on, boys.
- Okay.

485
00:36:06,374 --> 00:36:08,501
I didn't really see the accident.
I don't know whose fault it was.

486
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:12,421
- Oh, we're not here to talk
about the accident, Mr Dean.
- I'm sorry, I thought you said
you were here--

487
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:14,924
We should apologize
for the confusion, sir.

488
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:17,343
It's just that we're handling
a different aspect of the inquiry.

489
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:21,180
Um, it turns out Mr Zavitz was
involved in an extortion scheme.

490
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:24,517
- What kind of watch is that?
- Did you represent Mr Zavitz
as an attorney?
- It's an Omega.

491
00:36:24,684 --> 00:36:27,895
- No, I didn't.
- So you're not constrained
by attorney-client privilege?

492
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:30,731
- Shh-shh. Yeah, that's correct.
- You see, Mr Dean...

493
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:34,318
we have reason to believe
that Mr Zavitz may have passed
sensitive materials to you.

494
00:36:35,987 --> 00:36:39,657
- What kind of materials?
- Well, sensitive, so we're hoping
that you could tell us that.

495
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:42,952
Uh, no, he-he didn't pass me anything.

496
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,539
These voice stress points indicate
a really high degree of anxiety.

497
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:49,917
- Anxiety about what?
- That's the nature of physics.

498
00:36:50,084 --> 00:36:53,004
If he'd have given me something,
I would've known.

499
00:36:53,171 --> 00:36:56,424
- Oh, he's lying-
- What about your packages, sir?

500
00:36:56,591 --> 00:36:59,510
Could something have slipped in amongst
the purchases without your knowledge?

501
00:36:59,677 --> 00:37:02,638
Excuse me. Daniel Zavitz
did not give me anything.

502
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:05,808
- That's a Parker pen.
- It's a Mont Blanc.

503
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:09,061
He didn't secrete it
into any of my bodily orifices.

504
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:12,231
- Whatever it is, I don't have it.
- Could we look at them?

505
00:37:12,398 --> 00:37:15,651
- I don't think so.
Not without a warrant.
- Oh, Christ.

506
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:18,362
- This guy's good.
- How did you happen
to be at Ruby's today?

507
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:20,865
I was shopping for some lingerie.
That's still legal, isn't it?

508
00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:24,702
- You buying that for your wife?
- No, I was, uh, picking
something up for myself.

509
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:27,997
I do a little cross-dressing
on the weekends.
You know, you'd be surprised...

510
00:37:28,164 --> 00:37:31,042
how a nice pair of edible panties
can make a guy feel sexy.

511
00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:35,171
We thought it might be
for Rachel Banks.

512
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:37,673
Good night, gentlemen.

513
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:42,136
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Mr Dean.

514
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:02,406
What are they talking about, Porsche?
There's nothing here.

515
00:38:08,955 --> 00:38:11,082
Honey, I'm home.

516
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:15,711
Uh, yeah, uh, just a second, sweetie.

517
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:26,264
Well, either he's getting ready
to do something with it,
or he doesn't know he has it.

518
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,600
Or he doesn't have it.

519
00:38:29,767 --> 00:38:31,978
You know what I've seen?

520
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:37,024
I've seen killers walk free
because the eyewitness was an alcoholic.

521
00:38:37,191 --> 00:38:40,319
I've seen sex offenders
that couldn't be touched
because the victim was a call girl.

522
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:46,325
Credibility-- It's the only
currency that means anything
on this kind of playing field.

523
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:50,580
Dean's got the tape,
and he's gonna come out with it; and
when he does, I want his credibility.

524
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:53,457
I want people to know he's lying
before they hear what he says.

525
00:38:53,624 --> 00:38:56,752
We could take his wife and kid.
He'd give it up for them.

526
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:59,463
We'd have the police and the FBI
all over this in 24 hours.

527
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,967
Put taps on his 20
most frequently called numbers,
and let's get into his life.

528
00:39:03,134 --> 00:39:05,970
The union situation has--
has mob written all over it.

529
00:39:06,137 --> 00:39:08,181
And he's definitely vulnerable
on Rachel Banks.

530
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:10,141
I want to know about his wife,
I want to know about his parents...

531
00:39:10,308 --> 00:39:13,603
I want to know about
his gambling problems,
his urine samples, his porno rentals.

532
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:16,480
I want to use every means possible
to get what we need...

533
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:19,650
because this little
son of a bitch is not going to be
the final chapter of my life.

534
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:27,575
- Tell me something.
- Uh-oh.

535
00:39:27,742 --> 00:39:31,704
How did you find out Pintero
was associated with union officials?

536
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:34,790
I'm just that good.

537
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:37,668
I hired an investigator.

538
00:39:47,011 --> 00:39:49,680
- Hey.
- Shut up the dog-

539
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:54,143
My mom used to have one of these.
Come on. Ow- The dog bit me-

540
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:58,689
- Oh, who was the investigator?
- Wh-- I-- What do you mean? His name?

541
00:39:58,856 --> 00:40:02,902
Come on, Bobby. You know what I'm
asking. Is it the guy who Rachel knows?

542
00:40:04,278 --> 00:40:06,197
Ca-- Why do we-- Why do we have
to go through this every time?

543
00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:11,202
- Bobby, I'm just asking, okay?
- Carla, Rachel Banks is not
an issue any more.

544
00:40:27,093 --> 00:40:31,639
You are the only woman
in the world for me.

545
00:40:31,806 --> 00:40:34,267
You and Janet Jackson.

546
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:38,020
I-I have to be honest.
If-lf Janet Jackson called me...

547
00:40:38,187 --> 00:40:41,023
I w-- I-- I might have to change
my last name to Jackson.

548
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:45,236
Yeah, right. I'd have to break
that woman's legs too.

549
00:40:53,661 --> 00:40:57,206
- Lower, lower,
like kids would do it, damn it.
- You sound like a fuckin' old lady.
Shut up.

550
00:40:57,373 --> 00:41:00,501
Ooh, sensitive.

551
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:03,880
All right. Jones has some issues
we need to resolve.

552
00:41:05,798 --> 00:41:08,384
- Oh. Hey, Control, they are home.
- Uh-oh.

553
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,726
Move, guys.

554
00:41:16,893 --> 00:41:18,769
Oh, nice blender.

555
00:41:25,026 --> 00:41:27,695
Oh, my God.

556
00:41:31,741 --> 00:41:33,409
Oh, Porsche.

557
00:41:35,995 --> 00:41:40,291
Oh, damn. The dog is green.

558
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:43,503
Jones painted the-- the dog-

559
00:41:43,669 --> 00:41:46,506
This is Robert Dean, 2811 Sutton.
I'd like to report a break-in.

560
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:49,634
I don't know. Um, it's been vandalized.
From the looks of it, i-it's kids...

561
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,220
but I need a squad car
here immediately.

562
00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:05,233
- Here we go.
- We'll be checking out the rest
of the house, sir, ma'am.

563
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:14,200
At least they left me one.

564
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:22,291
How do you know
it wasn't Pintero?

565
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:25,336
I don't. It was just
kind of frivolous.

566
00:42:25,503 --> 00:42:28,548
I guess I'm just hopin'
it was kids.

567
00:42:38,516 --> 00:42:41,185
John.

568
00:42:50,945 --> 00:42:53,406
What have we here?

569
00:42:56,284 --> 00:42:59,036
I think we have a winner.

570
00:43:00,371 --> 00:43:02,373
Phone for phone.

571
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,959
- Take any of your clothes?
- No.

572
00:43:05,126 --> 00:43:07,545
They threw all my shoes
and suits in the tub...

573
00:43:07,712 --> 00:43:09,630
and spray painted my damn dog.

574
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:13,301
- Black.
- Black.

575
00:43:13,467 --> 00:43:15,469
Perfect. How does that look?

576
00:43:15,636 --> 00:43:18,181
Paging Mr Dean.

577
00:43:18,347 --> 00:43:20,850
We have you bugged, Mr Dean.

578
00:43:21,017 --> 00:43:25,855
They thrashed my computers,
my big-screen TV-- They took my blender.

579
00:43:26,022 --> 00:43:28,441
- What about jewellery?
- Nope.

580
00:43:28,608 --> 00:43:32,487
- What about silverware?
- Nope. Just my blender.

581
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:35,406
- Blender, huh?
- Loved that blender.

582
00:43:35,573 --> 00:43:38,409
You know, I did stuff
when I was a kid.

583
00:43:38,576 --> 00:43:41,370
I mean, not breaking-and-entering,
but, you know, stuff.

584
00:43:41,537 --> 00:43:44,832
Yeah, we all did stuff. I just wish
they hadn't stolen my damn blender.

585
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:47,793
You seem a little attached
to this blender, Robert.

586
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,590
Yeah, well, some people meditate,
some people get massages.

587
00:43:52,757 --> 00:43:56,552
- I blend.
- You're really weird, you know that?

588
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:00,973
Yeah, then on top of it, the only suit
they leave me is three years old.

589
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,017
Hasn't gotten any better with age.

590
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,856
Blow over? I'm not--
I'm not gonna sit around
and wait for this to blow over-

591
00:44:09,023 --> 00:44:12,652
Jerry, I-- I'm, I'm suing their
right-wing asses right into Chapter 11-

592
00:44:12,819 --> 00:44:15,988
This is flagrant- They never even called
to see what my side of the story was-

593
00:44:16,155 --> 00:44:18,991
- They have no Sullivan
protection with this-
- Mr Dean?

594
00:44:19,158 --> 00:44:21,410
- Yes.
- Rachel Banks is on line one...

595
00:44:21,577 --> 00:44:24,038
and, uh, Silverberg and Blake
would like to see you
in the conference room.

596
00:44:24,205 --> 00:44:28,042
All right. Uh, Jerry, uh,
I got to take this call. All right.

597
00:44:28,209 --> 00:44:31,796
- Hey, what's up?
- My firm called me this morning
telling me not to come in.

598
00:44:31,963 --> 00:44:34,298
- What? Why not?
- I don't know.

599
00:44:34,465 --> 00:44:37,343
Reporters are calling, asking me
about my relationship with you...

600
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:40,179
and how long
I've worked for the mob.

601
00:44:40,346 --> 00:44:42,932
- The mob, Bobby.
- Jesus.

602
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:46,727
- Do you know how hard
I worked to get this job?
- Yeah, I know. I know.

603
00:44:46,894 --> 00:44:49,981
Mr Dean, Silverberg and Blake
are still waiting to see you
in the conference room.

604
00:44:50,147 --> 00:44:53,317
- I heard you the first time.
Thank you.
- Look. You got your own problems.

605
00:44:53,484 --> 00:44:55,486
Uh, no, Rachel. It's fine.

606
00:44:55,653 --> 00:44:57,864
Oh, g--

607
00:45:04,495 --> 00:45:06,956
I just got off the phone
with a source that I trust.

608
00:45:07,123 --> 00:45:11,252
A grand jury is being convened
to look into your labour practise...

609
00:45:11,419 --> 00:45:14,172
as far back as the
electrical workers' strike.

610
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:19,552
- And why is that?
- They claim you helped create a shell
company for Sam Villotti in Zurich...

611
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:23,639
and that through your continuing
relationship, the Peitso family
has been able...

612
00:45:23,806 --> 00:45:28,811
to exert influence and provide
false witness to discredit our case.

613
00:45:28,978 --> 00:45:30,897
- Oh, well, that's true.
- You're admitting it?

614
00:45:31,063 --> 00:45:35,193
Sure. Everything except
setting up a company in Zurich...

615
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,695
or even knowing anyone
named Sam Villotti...

616
00:45:37,862 --> 00:45:41,908
or having any relationship
whatsoever to the Peitso family-

617
00:45:42,074 --> 00:45:45,077
- This is ridiculous-
- Robert--
- Uh, Mark, I'm tell you.

618
00:45:45,244 --> 00:45:46,954
This is Pintero.
He's coming back after me.

619
00:45:47,121 --> 00:45:49,916
You give me one week-- one week
and four guys from litigation...

620
00:45:50,082 --> 00:45:52,960
and I guarantee you,
we have this guy begging us--

621
00:45:53,127 --> 00:45:55,505
Tell us about Rachel Banks.

622
00:45:58,424 --> 00:46:01,928
Tell you what. Uh, she was my girlfriend
the second year of law school.

623
00:46:02,094 --> 00:46:06,599
We keep in touch.
We-We toss one another some work
every once in a while. Uh, that's it.

624
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:10,019
Did you have an affair
with her four years ago?

625
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:15,316
You ever beat off
in the shower, Brian?

626
00:46:15,483 --> 00:46:17,527
Hmm? You ever have
any homosexual thoughts?

627
00:46:17,693 --> 00:46:22,740
- Bobby, that is--
- None of my fucking business-
You're damn right it's not-

628
00:46:22,907 --> 00:46:25,785
I love my wife,
and I love my son absolutely...

629
00:46:25,952 --> 00:46:29,914
with no equivocations, and that's
none of your fuckin' business either-

630
00:46:30,081 --> 00:46:32,333
Uh, we think that you
should take a leave of absence...

631
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,502
until we're able
to, uh, sort all this out.

632
00:46:34,669 --> 00:46:37,588
- Are you firing me?
- I think you just fired yourself.

633
00:46:49,475 --> 00:46:51,727
Carla-

634
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,984
Where is she, Jen?

635
00:46:58,151 --> 00:47:00,611
- Don't go in there.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
- Why not?

636
00:47:00,778 --> 00:47:03,698
Because she's reading the paper.

637
00:47:07,326 --> 00:47:09,453
- Asshole.
- Carla--

638
00:47:11,789 --> 00:47:15,042
- How could you let me
find out like this?
- I'm findin' out like this.

639
00:47:15,209 --> 00:47:17,879
This is all lies.
Th-- None of this stuff is true.

640
00:47:18,004 --> 00:47:20,756
- So you're saying
you weren't there with her?
- Yes, I had lunch with her.

641
00:47:20,923 --> 00:47:24,552
We have lunch once a month. She's the
contact for the investigator, Brill.

642
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:29,015
You were right about that. Someone
must have taken this picture off the
security camera outside the restaurant.

643
00:47:29,182 --> 00:47:33,144
- You said she wasn't an issue.
- She's not- I have to see her
for business.

644
00:47:33,311 --> 00:47:37,732
-And I-- And I knew if I told you that--
-Bobby, you had an affair
with this woman- An affair.

645
00:47:37,899 --> 00:47:40,568
We went to a counsellor for a year-

646
00:47:40,693 --> 00:47:44,822
And now you're standin' there lyin'
about even seein' her? You make me sick-

647
00:47:47,867 --> 00:47:52,205
Carla, I am smeared all over
the newspapers for money-laundering
schemes, mob ties--

648
00:47:52,371 --> 00:47:55,374
I lost my job. I am asking you--

649
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:59,795
I'm asking you to please just trust me
on this Rachel Banks thing right now.

650
00:47:59,962 --> 00:48:04,842
How in God's name can I trust you?
Bobby, I want you to leave.

651
00:48:05,009 --> 00:48:07,678
- Carla, I'm telling you
that this is all bullshit-
- I don't wanna hear anything else.

652
00:48:07,803 --> 00:48:11,974
I don't wanna hear anything else.
I cannot think with you in my face.
I want you to leave.

653
00:48:12,141 --> 00:48:14,352
- What do you need to think about?
- Bobby, get out-
- I'm telling you it's bullshit-
- Get out-

654
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:17,188
Just leave, so I can think-
For me, okay? Just leave.

655
00:48:17,355 --> 00:48:21,901
Just go, Bobby. Go. Go.

656
00:48:24,946 --> 00:48:27,990
- You want a blend?
- Yeah.

657
00:48:28,157 --> 00:48:30,910
Thanks.

658
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:41,212
- Hi.
- Hi. Uh, I'd like to have a room
for the evening, please.

659
00:48:41,379 --> 00:48:44,674
Okay. Thank you.

660
00:48:48,261 --> 00:48:52,390
-I'm sorry, sir. This card was declined.
-Declined? This is a brand-new card.
Try it again, please.

661
00:48:52,557 --> 00:48:55,601
Yes, sir.

662
00:48:57,144 --> 00:48:59,939
You know, maybe it's
not activated yet.

663
00:49:00,106 --> 00:49:02,817
Thank you.
Run this one, please. Thank you.

664
00:49:02,984 --> 00:49:05,862
Yes, sir.

665
00:49:06,028 --> 00:49:08,573
No, it didn't go through.

666
00:49:08,739 --> 00:49:10,616
- But I'll try it again.
- N-No, thank you.

667
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:14,871
- My briefcase is gone.
- Excuse me, sir?

668
00:49:15,037 --> 00:49:17,707
- My briefcase was right here.
- Are you sure you brought it in?

669
00:49:17,832 --> 00:49:20,626
Yes, I'm sure I brought it in-

670
00:49:24,338 --> 00:49:27,800
Hi. This is Rachel.
Leave a message after the beep.

671
00:49:27,967 --> 00:49:30,428
Hey, Rachel, it's Bobby.
Uh, I need to talk to you...

672
00:49:30,595 --> 00:49:32,680
and I need to talk to you
face-to-face.

673
00:49:32,847 --> 00:49:37,059
Uh, meet me tomorrow, 11:00 a.m.,
Mount Vernon Square. I'll see you then.

674
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:40,646
Yes.

675
00:49:50,156 --> 00:49:51,908
All right, we're moving into
phase two of the training op.

676
00:49:52,074 --> 00:49:55,119
Selb's gonna brief you on it,
so listen up, all right?

677
00:49:55,286 --> 00:49:57,205
We're gonna be following
the subjects through the square.

678
00:49:57,371 --> 00:50:01,584
We're gonna have three listening
stations and two video surveillance
units with unidirectional mikes.

679
00:50:01,751 --> 00:50:04,754
Pratt, you're three.
Jones, Fiedler, Krug...

680
00:50:04,921 --> 00:50:07,173
you guys are at ground level.
You'll be following the targets.

681
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,467
You move when I say,
you go when I say.

682
00:50:09,634 --> 00:50:12,053
All handoffs go on my command.

683
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:14,889
Now, for the uninitiated,
if we don't have line-of-sight...

684
00:50:15,014 --> 00:50:17,683
we can't hear
what they say, right?

685
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:19,936
- Right?
- Yeah. Got it.

686
00:50:20,102 --> 00:50:23,105
- All right. You guys clear?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

687
00:50:23,272 --> 00:50:25,441
Jones, Krug, what, are you guys
from communications?

688
00:50:25,608 --> 00:50:28,528
- No, we're ops.
- You can tell by their haircuts.

689
00:50:36,744 --> 00:50:39,956
I would like to sit down
with Mr Pintero in private...

690
00:50:40,122 --> 00:50:41,958
so he and I can discuss
what's happening to me.

691
00:50:42,124 --> 00:50:44,168
I called; they said he was here.

692
00:50:44,335 --> 00:50:46,838
Mr Pintero would like to help you.

693
00:50:49,465 --> 00:50:52,009
- But he won't.
- And why not?

694
00:50:52,176 --> 00:50:54,554
Well, because first, you haven't
told him who made the tape...

695
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:59,934
and second, we've spent hundreds
of thousands of dollars...

696
00:51:00,101 --> 00:51:02,353
on shyster lawyers just like you...

697
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,941
because of shyster lawyers
just like you.

698
00:51:08,067 --> 00:51:10,528
Actually, I believe
the slur "shyster"...

699
00:51:10,695 --> 00:51:13,865
is generally reserved
for Jewish attorneys.

700
00:51:14,031 --> 00:51:16,951
I believe the proper slur
for someone like myself...

701
00:51:17,118 --> 00:51:19,328
would be, uh, "eggplant."

702
00:51:19,495 --> 00:51:22,582
Boom. This kid gets brighter
every time I see him.

703
00:51:28,504 --> 00:51:32,049
- You said 11:00 sharp.
- I know. Uh, Christmas
traffic is horrible.

704
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:39,515
You know, it's not so smart, us being
seen together in public like this.

705
00:51:39,682 --> 00:51:42,935
- Do we have anything to hide?
- Heavy background on one.
Could we do better on audio two?

706
00:51:43,102 --> 00:51:46,063
- Unfortunately not.
- Two is better.

707
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:48,191
IRS contacted me this morning.

708
00:51:48,357 --> 00:51:52,737
- Two, you're good. Hold position.
- They say my lifestyle
exceeds my income.

709
00:51:52,904 --> 00:51:54,947
Ohh. You're being audited?

710
00:51:55,114 --> 00:51:58,826
For the last four years.
What's going on, Bobby?

711
00:51:58,993 --> 00:52:03,206
Uh, look, don't worry about that.
W-- My firm will represent you
completely free of charge.

712
00:52:03,372 --> 00:52:07,668
- Eighty percent.
- You don't work there
any more, remember?

713
00:52:07,835 --> 00:52:10,922
- It's a temporary situation.
- Your 80's becoming a 20.
- Bullshit.
- Move to audio three.

714
00:52:11,088 --> 00:52:14,008
- On three. Much better. Much better.
- We're screwed.

715
00:52:14,175 --> 00:52:16,636
- Wake up, one.
- We are out.

716
00:52:19,138 --> 00:52:22,183
Rachel, I'm going to fix this.

717
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:24,227
- How?
- Tell me about Brill.

718
00:52:24,393 --> 00:52:28,272
- Did he say "Bill"?
- No, "Brill," with an "R."
- I can't do that.

719
00:52:28,439 --> 00:52:31,192
- Cross-reference Rachel's file.
See if the name "Brill" comes up.
- Got it.

720
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:35,530
Rachel, don't you see that he is
the key to this whole mess?

721
00:52:35,696 --> 00:52:38,658
From the second you gave me that tape,
my life has been falling apart.

722
00:52:38,825 --> 00:52:40,952
You assured me
that this-this guy was legit.

723
00:52:41,118 --> 00:52:44,622
- You needed information;
I got it for you.
- Two, you're good. Hold position.

724
00:52:44,789 --> 00:52:48,584
- Three is good.
- This conversation is over.

725
00:52:50,795 --> 00:52:54,048
- Okay, here we go.
- What are you gonna do?
You gonna wander around--
- Two, you gotta do better.

726
00:52:54,215 --> 00:52:57,093
- Want your job back--
- Shit.
- Do you want your life back?

727
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:59,929
I don't have a life.

728
00:53:00,054 --> 00:53:02,765
I'm in love with a married man.

729
00:53:08,229 --> 00:53:10,982
Okay, I have 'em on the bench.

730
00:53:11,149 --> 00:53:16,404
Rachel, I'm sorry, but there's
nothing I can do about that.

731
00:53:16,571 --> 00:53:20,032
What makes you think it's you?

732
00:53:21,284 --> 00:53:24,620
It's not me?

733
00:53:24,787 --> 00:53:26,706
I j-- I just as-assumed from--

734
00:53:26,873 --> 00:53:31,460
- You're a moron, you know that?
- Yes. I know.

735
00:53:36,007 --> 00:53:39,677
Rachel, you're gonna have
to tell me about Brill.

736
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,306
Let's get outta here.

737
00:53:43,472 --> 00:53:45,975
All right. They're on the move.

738
00:53:46,142 --> 00:53:50,146
- Comin' to three.
- Stay with 'em.
- I got 40's, 20--

739
00:53:52,106 --> 00:53:55,067
- You're following through trees.
Two, can you track them?
- I lost line-of-sight.

740
00:53:55,234 --> 00:53:58,154
- Repeat, I have lost line-of-sight.
- Three, you've got nothing.

741
00:53:58,321 --> 00:54:02,950
- Lost line-of-sight. I'm out.
- We lost audio. It's gone. But we have
his tracers. We can still follow 'em.

742
00:54:03,117 --> 00:54:05,036
When I need to reach Brill, I--

743
00:54:05,203 --> 00:54:08,456
I chalk the mailbox
outside my house.

744
00:54:08,623 --> 00:54:11,667
When he crosses the mark,
I make the drop.

745
00:54:11,834 --> 00:54:15,838
The location's always the same--
same time, same place.

746
00:54:16,005 --> 00:54:19,258
3:00 p.m. ferry to Gibson Island.

747
00:54:19,425 --> 00:54:22,220
- You ever see him in person?
- He's the cautious type.

748
00:54:22,386 --> 00:54:25,765
He's not gonna like you
trackin' him down.

749
00:54:27,433 --> 00:54:29,519
The drop is behind seat 32.

750
00:54:29,685 --> 00:54:33,314
I leave something;
he picks it up later.

751
00:55:26,909 --> 00:55:30,955
I'm sorry it took so long. I had to
make sure you weren't being followed.

752
00:55:31,122 --> 00:55:33,541
- Brill.
- Brill's dead.

753
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:36,878
Died of smallpox when he was two.
Buried in a field in Kansas.

754
00:55:37,044 --> 00:55:40,006
- What is that ?
- It's a bug-sweeper.

755
00:55:42,341 --> 00:55:44,844
- Take off your left shoe.
- What does it mean when--

756
00:55:45,011 --> 00:55:48,848
Take off your shoe. I don't have time to
explain. Take off your shoe right now.

757
00:55:49,015 --> 00:55:51,058
Come on.

758
00:56:00,193 --> 00:56:03,613
It's a beacon transmitter.
Thousand-yard range.

759
00:56:03,779 --> 00:56:05,990
They're close. Let's go.

760
00:56:07,366 --> 00:56:11,037
Who is "they"?

761
00:56:11,204 --> 00:56:13,873
And why are they puttin' things
in my shoes?

762
00:56:19,253 --> 00:56:22,048
No, get in the back,
like you're a customer.

763
00:56:28,054 --> 00:56:30,806
Everything's gone--
the wife, job...

764
00:56:30,973 --> 00:56:33,851
bank accounts, everything.

765
00:56:34,018 --> 00:56:36,604
You said Zavitz was behind
an extortion scheme?

766
00:56:36,771 --> 00:56:39,440
- No, they said it.
- You were the last one
that talked to him?

767
00:56:39,565 --> 00:56:43,569
- Yeah.
- What did he say?
- He didn't say anything.
He said, uh, "Help me, Bobby."

768
00:56:43,736 --> 00:56:47,156
- Help me with what?
- I don't know. We never got
around to that.

769
00:56:48,866 --> 00:56:52,036
- What did he give you?
- Nothing. He didn't give me anything.

770
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:03,047
Listen, you gotta come clean.
If you bullshit me, I can't help you.

771
00:57:03,214 --> 00:57:06,467
- No- I'm tellin' ya,
he didn't give me anything. Nothing.
- A name? A phone number?

772
00:57:06,634 --> 00:57:10,137
No, nothing-
He didn't give me anything-

773
00:57:16,894 --> 00:57:19,730
- Who the hell is that?
- Oh, just somebody trying
to get our attention.

774
00:57:19,897 --> 00:57:22,775
Well, he's doing
a good job.

775
00:57:25,611 --> 00:57:28,406
Two-zero-nine to anybody.
I need help.

776
00:57:28,573 --> 00:57:31,784
- Who you calling?
I thought you worked alone.
- Just shut up a second.

777
00:57:49,218 --> 00:57:51,262
- Stay exactly where you are.
- Hey-

778
00:57:54,265 --> 00:57:56,809
Look what you did to my car-

779
00:58:04,192 --> 00:58:06,319
Shit-

780
00:58:14,327 --> 00:58:18,414
Okay, gentlemen, we have a subject
entering the structure on the
northeast corner of Chambers and Light.

781
00:58:18,581 --> 00:58:21,292
That's 105 Chambers Avenue.

782
00:58:21,459 --> 00:58:25,630
- Run a check on all six tracers.
- All six tracers are operative.

783
00:58:25,796 --> 00:58:28,758
- Call up geo-position.
- Yeah, I got it. No problem.
- Task keyhole their coordinates.

784
00:58:28,925 --> 00:58:33,471
All right. LAT, 39 degrees, 14 minutes.
LONG, 74 degrees, 39 minutes.

785
00:58:48,486 --> 00:58:51,280
- Hello.
- Carla, don't hang up on me.

786
00:58:51,447 --> 00:58:54,659
- Robert, do you know what
I'm looking at right now?
- Carla, listen.

787
00:58:54,826 --> 00:58:59,288
Photographs of you and Rachel
taken today. Is this true?

788
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:02,333
Carla-- Carla, how did
you get the pictures?

789
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,669
By messenger, Robert-
By messenger.

790
00:59:04,836 --> 00:59:07,880
- What does it matter?
- Look, all right, um--

791
00:59:08,172 --> 00:59:10,925
Some-- Something's going on.
I don't-- I don't know who it is.

792
00:59:11,092 --> 00:59:13,553
Robert,
I went to the store today...

793
00:59:13,719 --> 00:59:16,389
and my ATM and my credit cards
didn't work.

794
00:59:16,556 --> 00:59:19,225
- I know. Mine either.
- I couldn't buy food.

795
00:59:21,769 --> 00:59:25,022
- I gotta go.
- What do you mean you gotta go?

796
00:59:25,189 --> 00:59:28,526
- Carla-- Carla, I gotta-- I gotta go.
- Robert, wait a minute.

797
00:59:36,909 --> 00:59:39,036
Get on the fucking elevator.

798
00:59:45,543 --> 00:59:47,545
Oh, really?

799
00:59:52,758 --> 00:59:55,011
Got vertical movement here.

800
00:59:56,762 --> 00:59:59,223
Elevator.
He's in an elevator.

801
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:02,727
- We're losing our tracking.
- Anybody got a visual?
- We need to move location
and get better signal.

802
01:00:02,894 --> 01:00:05,480
- I'm on it.
- Are you guys there yet?
- Negative.

803
01:00:17,074 --> 01:00:19,410
What the fuck is going on?

804
01:00:22,288 --> 01:00:26,250
- Shh.
- Wait. They stopped.

805
01:00:31,631 --> 01:00:35,134
Hold it.

806
01:00:38,221 --> 01:00:41,098
- I don't know what your problem--
- Shh.

807
01:01:00,827 --> 01:01:04,163
I'm getting high-frequency clutter.
We lost tracers one, two and six.

808
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:07,500
Their signals are completely dead.
Something is wrong here.

809
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:24,892
Get up.

810
01:01:27,061 --> 01:01:31,482
- Tracers three, four and five
are on their way up.
- He's getting help, boys.
He's getting help.

811
01:01:31,649 --> 01:01:35,153
We had an arrangement.
No contact. You broke the rules.

812
01:01:35,319 --> 01:01:37,989
They got to be heading for the roof.
Air One, we need to establish
visual on the rooftop...

813
01:01:38,156 --> 01:01:39,991
northeast corner,
Chambers and Light.

814
01:01:40,158 --> 01:01:42,827
Copy that. Rooftop,
northeast corner, Chambers and Light.

815
01:01:42,952 --> 01:01:46,247
Do you know how many federal agents
you had following you on that ferry?

816
01:01:46,414 --> 01:01:49,292
- I-I don't--
- Who are you working for?
- What are you talking about? I'm not--

817
01:01:49,458 --> 01:01:52,503
Is that about me? Am I a target here?
Do they know me?

818
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:56,465
-Who is "they"?
-Do they know me?
-I don't know what you're talking about-

819
01:01:59,051 --> 01:02:01,762
You're either very smart
or incredibly stupid.

820
01:02:01,929 --> 01:02:04,056
Get off. Come on.

821
01:02:09,187 --> 01:02:12,482
- I got separating signals here.
- Tracer three is on its way down.
Four and five are still together.

822
01:02:12,648 --> 01:02:13,733
Where did he go?

823
01:02:13,983 --> 01:02:18,654
- How'd you find out about the ferry?
Who set that up for you?
- Rachel did. Who was that other guy?

824
01:02:18,821 --> 01:02:22,533
- What did he say, exactly?
- He said he was Brill.

825
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:26,496
Did he say it or did you say it,
and he picked up on it? Come on. Think.

826
01:02:26,662 --> 01:02:29,832
- Shit, I said it.
- God damn it. You see,
that's why I have rules.

827
01:02:29,999 --> 01:02:33,044
- Is all this about Pintero?
- You think the mob
uses devices like this?

828
01:02:39,842 --> 01:02:43,679
-Excuse me, sir.
Where are your elevators?
-Right over there.
-In your phone was a GPS sat-tracker.

829
01:02:43,846 --> 01:02:46,265
- Pulse is at 24 gigahertz.
- I don't know what that means.

830
01:02:46,432 --> 01:02:49,560
It's like a Lo Jack,
only two generations better
than what the police have.

831
01:02:49,727 --> 01:02:52,897
- And what does that mean?
- Do you speak English?
- Obviously not that well.

832
01:02:53,064 --> 01:02:57,485
You're kind of a jerk, aren't you?
It means the NSA can read the time
off your fucking wristwatch.

833
01:02:57,652 --> 01:03:02,156
All right. Enough of this bullshit.
Right now, you either shoot me
or tell me what the fuck is going on-

834
01:03:03,741 --> 01:03:07,411
- Jones, you take the stairs.
- Krug, hold the perimeter.
Come in on my signal.

835
01:03:07,578 --> 01:03:10,248
The National Security Agency
conducts worldwide surveillance--

836
01:03:10,414 --> 01:03:12,750
fax, phones,
satellite communication.

837
01:03:12,917 --> 01:03:16,546
They're the only ones in the country,
including the military, who could
possibly have anything like this.

838
01:03:16,712 --> 01:03:19,465
- Why are they after me?
- I don't know, and I don't wanna know.

839
01:03:19,632 --> 01:03:23,302
Here they come. I thought these
sat dishes would scramble their signals.

840
01:03:23,469 --> 01:03:25,596
Control, this is Air One.
Repeat coordinates.

841
01:03:25,763 --> 01:03:27,723
105 Chambers Avenue.

842
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:30,643
You're transmitting.
They still have a signal on you.

843
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:33,771
Your collar, your belt, your zipper.
Get rid of your clothes.
All of them.

844
01:03:33,938 --> 01:03:38,568
- And then what am I supposed to do?
- Nothing. You live another day,
I'll be very impressed.

845
01:03:38,734 --> 01:03:42,905
- Two targets, rooftop, north side.
- Understood. Two targets, rooftop.
Maintain visual, please.

846
01:03:43,072 --> 01:03:45,741
- You have something they want.
- Look, I don't have anything-

847
01:03:45,908 --> 01:03:49,453
Maybe you do and you don't know it.
You stay away from Rachel
and you stay away from me.

848
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:52,957
You come near either one of us, I'm
gonna kill you. Get rid of your watch.

849
01:03:53,124 --> 01:03:57,795
- My wife gave me this
for our anniversary.
- Then keep it. Stay off the phone.

850
01:04:06,262 --> 01:04:09,098
- Wait a minute. Either he just
committed suicide here--
- Or he learned to fly.

851
01:04:09,265 --> 01:04:12,560
- Air One, stay with him.
- Target's on the move.

852
01:04:12,727 --> 01:04:15,313
Satellite imagery
coming through.

853
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:19,817
One metre res layering wireframe
coming your way. Over.

854
01:04:19,984 --> 01:04:21,944
Okay, gentlemen,
we're back on-line.

855
01:04:22,111 --> 01:04:24,447
Okay. Wireframe download complete.

856
01:04:24,614 --> 01:04:27,992
All right. We have a tracer
in the stairwell on 20 travelling down.

857
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:30,161
Nineteen, eighteen...

858
01:04:33,122 --> 01:04:35,458
seventeen...

859
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:38,503
Moving up-

860
01:04:42,673 --> 01:04:45,176
He's out of the stairwell
on 17. Go to 17.

861
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:53,518
Oh, shit.

862
01:05:06,614 --> 01:05:08,908
Shit. Mr Wu.

863
01:05:09,075 --> 01:05:11,828
- Target is holding on 17.
Zoom three Mag.
- Zooming.

864
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:15,790
Mr Wu.

865
01:05:18,376 --> 01:05:20,962
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

866
01:05:21,128 --> 01:05:23,548
Hi. I'm from hotel hospitality
and evaluation.

867
01:05:23,714 --> 01:05:26,551
Oh, no, no. No tip. I'm fine.
Thank you. No tip.

868
01:05:26,717 --> 01:05:30,513
- Hello.
- Hi.
- I just wanna make sure that you folks
have absolutely everything you need...

869
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:34,267
- to be completely comfortable.
- I got something here.

870
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:38,229
- We got him.
- Krug, Jones...

871
01:05:38,396 --> 01:05:40,439
get your asses up here
to the 17th floor right now.

872
01:05:40,606 --> 01:05:44,026
That's really important
to us here.

873
01:05:44,193 --> 01:05:47,822
- Mr Dean? I'd like to talk to you
for a second, if I could.
- Oh, shit.

874
01:05:47,989 --> 01:05:50,324
My clothes.

875
01:05:50,491 --> 01:05:54,704
- Shit-
- Yeah.

876
01:05:54,871 --> 01:05:56,789
Mr Dean?

877
01:06:01,043 --> 01:06:04,922
Mr Dean, if you could just come
to the door for a second, sir,
we could work this all out.

878
01:06:07,133 --> 01:06:09,802
I can't-- I got rabies or something.
I can't do it. I can't do it.

879
01:06:23,566 --> 01:06:25,776
Let's go.

880
01:06:35,453 --> 01:06:38,122
- Okay, that's our last tracer.
- Mr Dean-

881
01:06:38,247 --> 01:06:41,334
Let's not let this get out of hand.
Let's not involve
the hotel guests in this.

882
01:06:44,795 --> 01:06:46,797
Down, ma'am, sir.
Sit down. Please? Thank you. Thank you.

883
01:06:50,927 --> 01:06:54,305
-Door-
-Everything's gonna be all right, folks.

884
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,311
Krug, balcony-

885
01:07:00,478 --> 01:07:04,023
Air One and Control, we got him.
He's dropped to the 16th floor.

886
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:07,652
Air One, visual support. Check
perimeter, south side of the building.

887
01:07:07,819 --> 01:07:10,530
Ten-four, Control.
We have visual.

888
01:07:17,286 --> 01:07:19,997
- He jumped to 15. Go to 15.
- Go-

889
01:07:22,667 --> 01:07:25,419
Grab his clothes.

890
01:07:25,586 --> 01:07:29,006
Let's go, gentlemen.
Weapons away.

891
01:07:33,344 --> 01:07:36,305
Go-

892
01:07:37,473 --> 01:07:39,308
Move-

893
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:49,527
- Dean, open this door, God damn it-
- What are you doing? Come on-

894
01:08:01,539 --> 01:08:06,377
Dean, come on now-
We just wanna talk- Open this door-

895
01:08:18,931 --> 01:08:20,766
Open that door-

896
01:08:27,231 --> 01:08:30,735
- D.C. Metro.
Our partner's trapped inside.
- Yeah. We gotta evacuate this building-

897
01:08:37,074 --> 01:08:39,577
Control, Air One. We have
approaching emergency vehicles.

898
01:08:39,744 --> 01:08:43,789
Team, the show's going public,
and they're coming in the front door.
Stand down. Maintain visual perimeter.

899
01:08:43,956 --> 01:08:46,709
This is Air One.
We're outta here.

900
01:08:50,296 --> 01:08:54,300
We have a friend, Chavez,
on the 15th floor. We got one man
trapped and possibly down.

901
01:08:54,467 --> 01:08:56,761
Hey, there's a guy
trapped in there-

902
01:09:06,979 --> 01:09:09,357
You're going to be okay, guy.
You're going to be all right.

903
01:09:13,778 --> 01:09:17,490
- Okay, we are travelling.
Known destination?
- St. Elizabeth's.
- St. Elizabeth's Hospital.

904
01:09:17,657 --> 01:09:20,243
- We need sat backup now.
- It's already done.

905
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:33,923
Hey. Take it easy, guy.
You're going to be all right.
Just calm down. Okay.

906
01:09:36,342 --> 01:09:39,804
- Easy, fella.
- I'm sorry. I gotta go.
Stop the ambulance.

907
01:09:39,971 --> 01:09:43,641
- Tell him to stop--
Tell him to stop it now-
- Pull over, George.
- Easy, fella.

908
01:09:47,103 --> 01:09:49,522
- He's getting out- He's getting out-
- Son of a bitch-

909
01:09:51,941 --> 01:09:54,777
He's escaped the ambulance and he's
on foot. But our guys are in pursuit.

910
01:09:54,944 --> 01:09:58,406
- Task keyhole their coordinates.
- All right.
LAT 39 degrees, 27 minutes.

911
01:09:58,573 --> 01:10:01,284
LONG, 74 degrees,
42 minutes.

912
01:10:04,495 --> 01:10:09,167
- Move, guys.
- Go, go, go- Damn it-
Go around- Go around-

913
01:10:16,382 --> 01:10:19,051
- You're on. Go.
- Tunnel Control, this is D.C. Metro.

914
01:10:19,177 --> 01:10:22,388
In pursuit armed felon loose
in tunnel. Requesting video help.

915
01:10:24,682 --> 01:10:29,645
Metro, this is Tunnel Control.
Yeah, we got a 20 on your suspect
heading south in tunnel six.

916
01:10:29,812 --> 01:10:31,731
Copy that.

917
01:10:33,024 --> 01:10:36,319
Yeah, we got him, we got him. He's right
in front of us. Uh, tunnel six.

918
01:10:36,486 --> 01:10:40,031
- He's heading south down tunnel six.
- I got him. I got him.
- He's got nowhere to go.

919
01:10:43,367 --> 01:10:46,537
He crossed over.
He's on the wrong side.

920
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:52,543
Stop- Stop-

921
01:10:55,713 --> 01:10:58,716
We lost him. We lost him.
Son of a bitch- Pull over.

922
01:11:01,552 --> 01:11:05,056
- He's currently entering
vertical stairwell five.
- Where does that lead?

923
01:11:05,223 --> 01:11:08,184
Five leads to main access
to sub-ventilation tunnel.

924
01:11:08,351 --> 01:11:13,189
- Request closest vehicular access.
- Adjacent utility entrance, south side.
- Copy that.

925
01:11:13,356 --> 01:11:17,276
Boys, he's in the ventilation tunnel.
Proceed to the adjacent utility
entrance on the south side.

926
01:11:17,443 --> 01:11:20,738
- There is no visual coverage.
- They got him- They got him-
He's in a ventilation tunnel-

927
01:11:20,905 --> 01:11:24,200
To the service entrance
at the south end- Come on- Let's go-

928
01:11:24,367 --> 01:11:26,410
Come on- Go-

929
01:12:23,968 --> 01:12:27,513
- Normally, I wouldn't do this.
- Do you guys have him?
Talk to me, people.

930
01:12:38,983 --> 01:12:42,153
- Shit-
- Shit-

931
01:12:48,784 --> 01:12:50,703
I don't understand
why this is so difficult.

932
01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:53,664
He shed the sensors. He's clever.
And he's had help.

933
01:12:53,831 --> 01:12:58,002
- Maybe it's the real Brill.
- There's 23 Brills
in the Baltimore/D.C. area.

934
01:12:58,169 --> 01:13:00,671
None of them check out. We're running it
through the EPIC computer now.

935
01:13:00,838 --> 01:13:04,008
- Do you think we're being set up?
- What, somebody in the agency?

936
01:13:04,175 --> 01:13:06,469
I don't know.

937
01:13:06,636 --> 01:13:10,681
It just tastes
a little off, doesn't it?

938
01:13:10,848 --> 01:13:14,143
- I know what you mean.
- Let's raise the stakes.

939
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:17,647
Make things a bit more serious for Mr
Dean. We'll both think about how, okay?

940
01:13:17,814 --> 01:13:19,690
Okay. Good.

941
01:13:25,488 --> 01:13:27,865
- Anything wrong?
- No.

942
01:13:30,785 --> 01:13:35,039
You know, you should have made deputy
director two years ago, maybe three.

943
01:13:35,206 --> 01:13:38,543
But it'll happen now. Once this bill
passes, that'll be it for you.

944
01:13:47,885 --> 01:13:49,804
Thanks, Maria.

945
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:01,440
Porsche, what are you
barking at, boy?

946
01:14:13,077 --> 01:14:15,746
- Porsche?
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

947
01:14:15,913 --> 01:14:18,916
- Hey, it's me. It's me.
- I know it's you.
You scared the shit out of me.

948
01:14:19,083 --> 01:14:23,087
The house is bugged. Electronically.
Everything you say in there,
they can hear and maybe even see.

949
01:14:23,254 --> 01:14:25,298
Listen to me.
Listen, listen.

950
01:14:25,464 --> 01:14:28,926
I never-- I sw-- I swear to God.
I never-- Th-This is the truth.

951
01:14:29,093 --> 01:14:32,138
I never-- Ever since the problem,
I've never touched Rachel like that.

952
01:14:32,305 --> 01:14:36,309
I never-- I never even looked at her
like that, honey. I love you.

953
01:14:36,476 --> 01:14:40,313
I love you, and that is it.
That is it. Only you.

954
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:44,275
- What about Eric?
- And Eric.

955
01:14:44,442 --> 01:14:47,778
And I love your family.
Except for your dad.

956
01:14:50,531 --> 01:14:53,743
I need you. I need you real bad.
I need you, okay?

957
01:14:57,038 --> 01:14:59,040
Okay.

958
01:15:00,625 --> 01:15:02,835
I told you, Bobby.

959
01:15:03,002 --> 01:15:05,254
I told you they had
this type of capability.

960
01:15:05,421 --> 01:15:08,925
And that goddam privacy bill
is just another way for them
to expand the power.

961
01:15:09,091 --> 01:15:11,886
- Shh.
- Don't you "shh" me.

962
01:15:14,472 --> 01:15:18,935
You were right. I was wrong.
But this is not the time
for the "I told you so" speech.

963
01:15:19,101 --> 01:15:22,855
That day when Daniel Zavitz got hit
by the fire truck, he was running.
H-He was scared.

964
01:15:23,022 --> 01:15:26,442
The same people-- I know it now--
the people that were chasing him,
that's the people that are chasing me.

965
01:15:26,609 --> 01:15:29,987
- Bobby, are you serious?
- I need you to go to Philadelphia.
Stay there with your family.

966
01:15:30,154 --> 01:15:33,032
- Ju-Just give me time to work this out.
I'll get in touch with you.
- Oh, no. I don't think so.

967
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:35,284
They're not chasing me
out of my house. Uh-uh, Bobby.

968
01:15:35,451 --> 01:15:37,537
They're not chasing me--
I picked those drapes-

969
01:15:37,703 --> 01:15:41,123
Shh, shh.
Nobody cares about the drapes.

970
01:15:41,290 --> 01:15:43,835
Just one time can I make
some decisions around here? Please?

971
01:15:44,001 --> 01:15:47,380
Just go to Philadelphia.
I need you to do that for me, okay?

972
01:15:47,547 --> 01:15:50,633
- Okay.
- I miss you.

973
01:15:52,969 --> 01:15:55,179
Oh, God.

974
01:15:55,346 --> 01:15:58,474
Oh, I miss you so much.

975
01:16:00,601 --> 01:16:03,688
- You can't wear that.
That's a Christmas present.
- I know. I'm sorry.

976
01:16:03,855 --> 01:16:08,025
- But, baby, I missed you. I was lonely.
- How you just gonna go through
my stuff like that?

977
01:16:08,192 --> 01:16:11,154
Baby, until I actually give it to you,
that's still mine.

978
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,865
Yeah, but it looks better on me,
don't you think?

979
01:16:15,825 --> 01:16:18,161
Baby, you're
as bad as Eric.

980
01:16:18,327 --> 01:16:21,497
I missed you so much.

981
01:16:25,126 --> 01:16:27,253
- What?
- Oh, shit. That was the night.

982
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:30,256
That was the night
that I came home with the presents.

983
01:16:30,423 --> 01:16:32,633
- Where is Eric?
- He's at Dylan's house.

984
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:36,179
He's probably on the way to school.
What? What's going on?

985
01:16:36,345 --> 01:16:40,099
- What are you doing with that?
- Shh. Here, baby. Shh, shh.
- No, no. No. I don't want it.
I don't want it.

986
01:16:40,266 --> 01:16:43,686
- Take it. Take it.
- What do you want me to do with this?
- Get me some money. I need some
clothes. Put it away.

987
01:16:43,853 --> 01:16:46,397
- Okay. Okay.
- Tell Maria we need her car. Chances
are they wouldn't have bugged it.

988
01:16:46,564 --> 01:16:49,484
Oh, shit. Eric.

989
01:16:59,202 --> 01:17:02,371
Base, this is unit one.
The nanny is leaving. Please advise.

990
01:17:02,538 --> 01:17:05,416
Stay put. We have satellite tracking
and Bingham at the school.

991
01:17:14,759 --> 01:17:18,554
Aw, man, let me follow
the nanny.

992
01:17:18,721 --> 01:17:22,141
She doesn't shave
her legs. Jesus-

993
01:17:22,308 --> 01:17:24,560
Women like that
are so hot.

994
01:17:24,727 --> 01:17:27,772
- Is there anybody following us?
- No. No, Mr Bobby.

995
01:17:27,939 --> 01:17:30,650
All right.
Drive a little faster. I wanna
catch 'em before they get to school.

996
01:17:37,573 --> 01:17:40,117
- There they are.
- Pull up to them and tell them
to get into the car.

997
01:17:40,284 --> 01:17:42,954
Okay.

998
01:17:43,079 --> 01:17:45,456
Eric, Dylan,
get in the car, please.

999
01:17:45,623 --> 01:17:47,750
- No, we're okay.
- Get in the car right now.

1000
01:17:47,917 --> 01:17:50,670
But school's right down the block.

1001
01:17:50,837 --> 01:17:53,506
You heard me.
Now, get in.

1002
01:17:57,385 --> 01:18:00,054
Come on-
Come on. Throw it-

1003
01:18:04,559 --> 01:18:06,477
- What's up, fellas?
- Dad?

1004
01:18:06,644 --> 01:18:09,021
No, no. Turn around.
Sit down. Face forward.

1005
01:18:09,188 --> 01:18:11,274
- But, Dad--
- What did I say, Eric?

1006
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:15,653
You guys both pick a spot
on those seats. We're gonna play a game.
You pick a spot and look right at it.

1007
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:18,865
You can't let anyone know
I'm back here, okay?

1008
01:18:19,031 --> 01:18:20,992
How you been, E.?
I missed you, man.

1009
01:18:21,159 --> 01:18:23,619
I missed you, too, Dad.
Where did you go?

1010
01:18:23,786 --> 01:18:28,666
Oh, they've been keeping me really busy
on this case. They're trying to work me
to death out there.

1011
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:32,336
- Are you and Mom getting a divorce?
- Face forward.

1012
01:18:32,503 --> 01:18:35,339
What are you talking about?
No, we're not getting a divorce.

1013
01:18:35,506 --> 01:18:38,551
I mean, so we, we had a little fight.
Sometimes married couples have fights.

1014
01:18:38,718 --> 01:18:41,846
- That's nothing
for you to worry about.
- Who won the fight?

1015
01:18:42,013 --> 01:18:45,183
This is your dad, Eric. You know
when I put my foot down, that's it.

1016
01:18:45,349 --> 01:18:48,895
- My mom won.
- Look, I-I have a question
I need to ask you...

1017
01:18:49,061 --> 01:18:52,190
and it is absolutely imperative
that you tell me the truth.

1018
01:18:52,356 --> 01:18:56,194
Now, no matter what you say,
I swear to you, you are not
going to get in trouble.

1019
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,237
- All right? You ready?
- Yeah.

1020
01:18:58,404 --> 01:19:01,199
You remember that night I came home
with those Christmas presents,
and you asked me, could--

1021
01:19:01,365 --> 01:19:05,953
I just looked in the bag, Dad.
I wouldn't have taken it,
except it was already open.

1022
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:11,209
All right, so we're clear.
But I need it. And I promise
I'll get you another one, Eric.

1023
01:19:11,375 --> 01:19:15,046
- Dad.
- What's the matter?
- It's broken.

1024
01:19:15,213 --> 01:19:18,382
It's not Eric's fault, Mr Dean.
It was always broken.

1025
01:19:18,549 --> 01:19:20,885
The screen just scrambles
when you turn it on.

1026
01:19:21,052 --> 01:19:24,722
- All right, but I need it, guys.
Do you have it here?
- Yeah, we have it.

1027
01:19:24,889 --> 01:19:27,016
Eric, just pass it
around the side to me.

1028
01:19:48,412 --> 01:19:51,749
Yes. Hello. Hi.
My name is Leon Newman.

1029
01:19:51,916 --> 01:19:53,960
I'm sorry.
What's your name, ma'am?

1030
01:19:54,126 --> 01:19:57,421
Sergeant Miller. Yes, we live
at 454 Beaumont Terrace.

1031
01:19:57,588 --> 01:19:59,882
Actually, my mother lives there.
I'm calling for her.

1032
01:20:00,049 --> 01:20:03,261
There's been a-a van sitting
outside all day, and...

1033
01:20:03,427 --> 01:20:05,388
I'm not trying to get anyone
in trouble or anything like that...

1034
01:20:05,555 --> 01:20:08,474
but, uh, I think they might be
doing drugs or-or something in there.

1035
01:20:08,641 --> 01:20:10,601
I was hoping you
could send a car by.

1036
01:20:12,395 --> 01:20:14,397
Thirty-one Allison,
all available units.

1037
01:20:14,564 --> 01:20:19,777
Check out a white van at 454 Beaumont
for a possible 1031 narcotics violation.

1038
01:20:19,944 --> 01:20:22,613
- Oh, eat me. That's us.
- Yep.

1039
01:21:00,234 --> 01:21:02,236
Rachel.

1040
01:21:02,403 --> 01:21:04,322
Rachel.

1041
01:22:22,859 --> 01:22:26,028
Oh, shit.

1042
01:22:55,349 --> 01:22:57,268
Open the door. Open the door-

1043
01:23:17,663 --> 01:23:21,584
- All right, what happened?
- Rachel's dead.

1044
01:23:26,964 --> 01:23:30,635
I told you not
to contact her. I told you.

1045
01:23:35,848 --> 01:23:38,142
Get out of the car.

1046
01:23:38,309 --> 01:23:43,272
- I think I found what they're
looking for. My son had it.
- Get out of the fucking car.

1047
01:24:24,689 --> 01:24:26,607
Give me the toy.

1048
01:24:36,284 --> 01:24:39,370
- You know why they killed her?
- Trying to make it look like it was me.

1049
01:24:39,537 --> 01:24:42,623
They-- They had my stuff planted
all over her house.

1050
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:46,711
First, if you're a murder suspect,
you're gonna be easier to find...

1051
01:24:46,878 --> 01:24:51,132
and second, to discredit you,
in case you ever go public against them.

1052
01:24:51,299 --> 01:24:56,095
The NSA set you up.
It had nothing to do with Rachel.

1053
01:24:56,262 --> 01:24:59,098
Absolutely nothing.

1054
01:25:05,062 --> 01:25:08,065
- What do we got?
- We got nothing.

1055
01:25:08,232 --> 01:25:10,193
All right. Pull up everything
we have on tape so far--

1056
01:25:10,359 --> 01:25:12,528
the square,
the house surveillance.

1057
01:25:12,695 --> 01:25:15,531
Van, give me the sat imagery
of the hotel roof.

1058
01:25:15,698 --> 01:25:20,870
Okay, here. These are the parametrics
for the space vehicle
during data acquisition.

1059
01:25:21,037 --> 01:25:23,581
Can we take a look at this guy
who's helping him? Who is he?

1060
01:25:26,375 --> 01:25:28,294
Can you get a feature extraction
and pattern matching on him?

1061
01:25:28,461 --> 01:25:31,130
Mm-mmm.
He never looks up.

1062
01:25:31,297 --> 01:25:33,758
- He's smart.
- Why does he have to look up?

1063
01:25:33,925 --> 01:25:37,929
The satellite's about
155 miles above the earth.
It can only look straight down.

1064
01:25:38,095 --> 01:25:40,932
- That's kind of limited, isn't it?
- Well, maybe you can design a new one.

1065
01:25:41,098 --> 01:25:43,643
Oh, maybe I will, idiot.

1066
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:49,065
Stay put. I need some food.
I need to eat.

1067
01:25:49,232 --> 01:25:52,068
Rockin' around the Christmas tree

1068
01:25:52,235 --> 01:25:55,863
Let the Christmas spirit ring

1069
01:25:56,030 --> 01:25:58,825
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie

1070
01:25:58,991 --> 01:26:02,620
And we'll do some carolling

1071
01:26:02,787 --> 01:26:05,122
You will get a sentiment--

1072
01:26:08,793 --> 01:26:11,671
- Hello.
- Yeah, it's me.
- Oh, it's you, asshole.

1073
01:26:11,838 --> 01:26:14,090
- What are you calling me for?
- Shut up and listen.

1074
01:26:14,257 --> 01:26:17,385
Go to the house. Go.
Do not call Carla.

1075
01:26:17,552 --> 01:26:21,264
Rachel Banks is dead. The papers will
make it sound like I killed her.

1076
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:23,641
Tell her that I didn't do it.

1077
01:26:23,808 --> 01:26:27,520
Make sure she goes. Get her
out of there. Tell 'em I love 'em.

1078
01:26:27,687 --> 01:26:33,317
The call is coming from 840 McClean,
Baltimore, between Hood and St. Anne's.

1079
01:26:33,484 --> 01:26:36,070
Copy that. Yes-

1080
01:26:54,881 --> 01:27:00,678
What's up, man? We're gonna have
to look at your surveillance tapes
for the last 20 minutes.

1081
01:27:00,845 --> 01:27:04,849
- Hey, Larry-
- The surveillance footage
is coming in right now from Pratt.

1082
01:27:05,016 --> 01:27:07,310
Freeze it and process it
for face recognition.

1083
01:27:16,652 --> 01:27:19,489
Pratt, do we see
which way the car went?

1084
01:27:19,655 --> 01:27:23,159
No, sir. This kid here at the register
thinks that it might have went south.

1085
01:27:23,326 --> 01:27:29,707
Unfortunately, the shot's too tight.
I got make, uh, model and colour,
but the plates are phony.

1086
01:27:29,874 --> 01:27:32,668
- Order satellite coverage
on this sector.
- It's already done.

1087
01:27:46,390 --> 01:27:50,269
- You planning a quick getaway?
- Yeah, ever since I met you.

1088
01:28:14,001 --> 01:28:17,463
Hate to see the chicken
that lives in this coop.

1089
01:28:17,630 --> 01:28:22,426
This is where I work.
Might seem strange to you, but this
has been my office for 15 years.

1090
01:28:22,593 --> 01:28:27,974
It's completely secure. Copper wire mesh
keeps the radio signals out.

1091
01:28:31,602 --> 01:28:35,064
This is the satellite imagery
of the convenience store 20 minutes ago.

1092
01:28:35,231 --> 01:28:37,984
- They're in an EI Camino.
- Eighty-six.

1093
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:45,783
- There it is.
- John, give us LAT 30, 64 minutes,
LONG 72, 29 minutes.

1094
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:49,996
- That's affirmative.
- There they are.

1095
01:28:50,163 --> 01:28:52,373
It's coming in from top left.

1096
01:28:54,959 --> 01:28:56,919
Let's go in there and get them.

1097
01:29:00,548 --> 01:29:04,469
I call it the jar.
No phone or utility lines coming in.

1098
01:29:04,635 --> 01:29:07,346
Self-contained.
Unplugged from the world.

1099
01:29:07,513 --> 01:29:09,932
Nothing for a wire bug
to piggyback in on.

1100
01:29:10,099 --> 01:29:14,312
That leaves only transmitters. It's
easy enough to signal-sweep for those.

1101
01:29:14,479 --> 01:29:18,191
Signal-sweeping for transmitters.
You're just a party animal.

1102
01:29:20,026 --> 01:29:24,697
See, the government's been in bed
with the entire telecommunications
industry since the '40s.

1103
01:29:24,864 --> 01:29:28,034
They've infected everything. They
can get into your bank statements...

1104
01:29:28,201 --> 01:29:32,663
your computer files, your e-mail,
listen to your phone calls.

1105
01:29:32,830 --> 01:29:37,460
- My wife's been saying that for years.
- Every wire, every airwave.

1106
01:29:37,627 --> 01:29:42,340
The more technology you use, the easier
it is for them to keep tabs on you.

1107
01:29:42,507 --> 01:29:47,220
It's a brave new world out there.
At least it better be.

1108
01:30:04,028 --> 01:30:08,950
There it goes.
It's some kind of simple encryption.

1109
01:30:09,116 --> 01:30:11,869
Oh, conspiracy theorists
of the world, unite.

1110
01:30:12,036 --> 01:30:14,956
It's more than a theory with me.
I'm a former conspirer.

1111
01:30:16,541 --> 01:30:20,419
Yeah, I used to work for the NSA.
I was a communication analyst.

1112
01:30:20,586 --> 01:30:22,922
Listen to international calls,
calls from foreign nationalists.

1113
01:30:23,089 --> 01:30:26,050
That GPS tracking device we found
in your cellular telephone?

1114
01:30:26,217 --> 01:30:29,428
I designed one of the first models
in that series.

1115
01:30:37,019 --> 01:30:42,275
Fort Meade has 18 acres
of mainframe computers underground.

1116
01:30:42,441 --> 01:30:46,737
You're talking to your wife
on the phone and you use the word
"bomb," "president," "Allah"...

1117
01:30:46,904 --> 01:30:49,448
any of a hundred key words,
the computer recognizes it...

1118
01:30:49,615 --> 01:30:51,826
automatically records it,
red-flags it for analysis.

1119
01:30:51,993 --> 01:30:54,495
That was 20 years ago.

1120
01:31:00,459 --> 01:31:02,670
You know the Hubble Telescope
that looks up at the stars?

1121
01:31:02,837 --> 01:31:07,258
They've got over a hundred spy
satellites looking down at us.
That's classified.

1122
01:31:07,425 --> 01:31:10,553
In the old days, we actually had
to tap a wire into your phone line.

1123
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:13,890
Now calls bouncing off satellites,
they snatch 'em right out of the air.

1124
01:31:17,226 --> 01:31:18,895
What's this?

1125
01:31:24,734 --> 01:31:27,778
- That's Phil Hamersly.
- Jesus Christ.

1126
01:31:36,662 --> 01:31:40,208
Who's this guy? I'm gonna check
the executive NSA files.

1127
01:31:40,374 --> 01:31:43,169
Let's run a photo ID on him.

1128
01:31:53,846 --> 01:31:56,766
Reynolds, Thomas Brian.
Born 9-11-40.

1129
01:31:56,933 --> 01:32:00,812
Attended Episcopal School, D.C.
B.A., Harvard, PhD, Princeton.

1130
01:32:00,978 --> 01:32:03,648
On loan from the State Department
since '95.

1131
01:32:03,773 --> 01:32:06,108
This guy's not a professional.
He's a politician.

1132
01:32:10,947 --> 01:32:14,283
Aw, shit- Take that.

1133
01:32:14,450 --> 01:32:17,620
- When was the last time
you contacted somebody you knew?
- When we stopped for food.

1134
01:32:17,787 --> 01:32:20,832
- Didn't I tell you
not to use the telephone?
- I called from a pay phone.

1135
01:32:20,998 --> 01:32:24,377
- What did I tell you?
- You told me no calls.

1136
01:32:24,544 --> 01:32:26,963
I told you no calls.

1137
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:31,050
- Get the cat. Get the cat.
- Hey, man--

1138
01:32:31,217 --> 01:32:33,386
- What's the cat's name?
- Babe.

1139
01:32:33,553 --> 01:32:37,640
Come here, baby. Come here, baby.
Baby, come, come. Come here-

1140
01:32:45,022 --> 01:32:47,358
Shit-

1141
01:32:50,361 --> 01:32:52,405
God damn it.

1142
01:33:02,665 --> 01:33:04,917
All right, baby,
what do we got?

1143
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:10,173
What the--

1144
01:33:18,139 --> 01:33:22,393
- Subjects exiting.
- Williams, get the hell out of there.

1145
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:26,814
This bitch is gonna blow-
Go, go, go- Move-

1146
01:33:43,915 --> 01:33:46,584
Come on- Go-

1147
01:33:50,588 --> 01:33:53,257
Move- Move- Move-

1148
01:34:00,598 --> 01:34:02,391
Move- Move-

1149
01:34:13,236 --> 01:34:15,238
- What the hell is happening?
- I blew up the building.

1150
01:34:15,404 --> 01:34:17,615
- Why?
- Because you made a phone call-

1151
01:34:27,792 --> 01:34:30,503
- Tell him to pull over-
- Pull the vehicle over now-

1152
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:37,969
Pull over now-

1153
01:34:53,651 --> 01:34:55,820
Pump action-

1154
01:35:13,379 --> 01:35:16,340
Gosh damn-

1155
01:35:19,510 --> 01:35:22,722
Fuel line must be broken.

1156
01:35:22,889 --> 01:35:25,808
- Get it out- Get it out- Goddam-
- Stop the car-

1157
01:35:34,734 --> 01:35:37,320
- Where's the disk?
- Shit-

1158
01:35:37,487 --> 01:35:41,741
No- Shit-
Look, is there any way to save it?

1159
01:35:41,908 --> 01:35:44,911
- Ah, that's ruined.
- What do we do?

1160
01:35:45,077 --> 01:35:47,663
- I'm leaving.
- Subjects heading west
across the coal fields.

1161
01:35:47,830 --> 01:35:51,918
- What do you mean you're leaving?
- The disk is gone.
We got nothing. It's over.

1162
01:36:04,347 --> 01:36:07,183
We have control.
Put down your weapons.

1163
01:36:15,066 --> 01:36:18,861
You think I wanted that disk?
You think I wanted that idiot
to put that goddam thing in my--

1164
01:36:19,028 --> 01:36:24,075
Who gives a fuck what you wanted?
Since you've shown up, Rachel's dead
and the NSA's onto me.

1165
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:31,290
Onto you? What do you mean onto you?
Onto you about what, Brill?

1166
01:36:31,457 --> 01:36:33,793
You're not the target.
I am.

1167
01:36:45,763 --> 01:36:48,516
This time we got him. We got him.
He's right in front of us.

1168
01:36:51,185 --> 01:36:53,688
Come on, come on.

1169
01:36:55,148 --> 01:36:58,359
We got him.
He's got nowhere to go. We got him.

1170
01:37:08,953 --> 01:37:11,497
Air One to ground,
they're somewhere between the trains.

1171
01:37:12,790 --> 01:37:15,209
Get the fuck away from me.

1172
01:37:16,836 --> 01:37:20,506
- Damn it-
- We're coming back around.

1173
01:37:20,673 --> 01:37:23,426
- You're blowing my whole life.
- What life?

1174
01:37:23,593 --> 01:37:26,471
You live in a fucking jar
so the world can't touch you.

1175
01:37:26,637 --> 01:37:31,309
And Rachel-- You didn't give a shit
about Rachel- Just some package
under seat number 32 to you.

1176
01:37:34,145 --> 01:37:37,940
- Come on-
- Do you have a problem?
- Do it- Go on- Do it-

1177
01:37:39,233 --> 01:37:42,528
I'm all you've got-
And you're all I've got.

1178
01:37:50,536 --> 01:37:53,498
Got 'em.
Heading west towards the freeway.

1179
01:38:03,883 --> 01:38:06,803
- Get out of the fucking car- Get out-
- All right.

1180
01:38:06,969 --> 01:38:09,806
- Come on. Get out. Move.
- Don't do this to me. Come on.

1181
01:38:09,972 --> 01:38:13,851
- Tell your story walking.
- Hey, wait a minute. Don't--
Oh, for God's sakes--

1182
01:38:14,018 --> 01:38:16,854
-Thanks for your help back at the train.
-Wait a minute.

1183
01:38:18,898 --> 01:38:20,858
Oh, for Jesus--

1184
01:38:21,025 --> 01:38:23,069
Air One to ground,
I think we lost them.

1185
01:38:23,319 --> 01:38:25,655
They're somewhere beneath the overpass.

1186
01:38:34,580 --> 01:38:38,459
Well, you certainly carjacked
a really nice car.

1187
01:38:38,626 --> 01:38:41,963
This is a piece of shit.
What are you talking about?

1188
01:38:44,006 --> 01:38:49,053
- I need sugar, you know.
I'm-I'm getting cranky.
- Getting?

1189
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:52,473
I'm hypoglycaemic. Uh, my body
can't metabolize the sugar, so--

1190
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:55,560
So you're a real, you know,
pain in the ass when you don't eat.

1191
01:38:55,726 --> 01:38:57,812
Basically.

1192
01:38:57,979 --> 01:39:00,064
Yeah. Right.

1193
01:39:00,231 --> 01:39:03,234
- We should eat then.
- Let's do that.

1194
01:39:04,402 --> 01:39:09,782
His real name is Edward Lyle.
Graduated from Drexel University.
Enlisted in the army, 1953.

1195
01:39:09,949 --> 01:39:15,037
Rapid promotion, excelled
at intelligence and communications.
Joined NSA in '65.

1196
01:39:15,204 --> 01:39:20,334
- Of course.
- Yeah. He was in the agency till 1980,
when he vanished and went underground.

1197
01:39:20,501 --> 01:39:23,921
- Hasn't been seen since.
- That's a long time.

1198
01:39:24,088 --> 01:39:26,549
Lots of black bags,
lots of deleteds.

1199
01:39:26,716 --> 01:39:29,427
He's familiar
with explosives, obviously.

1200
01:39:29,594 --> 01:39:33,473
His last assignment, he went into Iran,
late '78, after the Shah.

1201
01:39:33,639 --> 01:39:37,685
- This is our problem.
- This man.

1202
01:39:39,854 --> 01:39:44,108
So, we were helping
the secret police supply weapons...

1203
01:39:44,275 --> 01:39:46,402
to the Afghani rebels
fighting the Soviets.

1204
01:39:46,569 --> 01:39:51,115
My partner and I were
on the eastern border monitoring
Soviet military transmissions.

1205
01:39:51,282 --> 01:39:55,036
It was kind of fun, actually.
I liked the Iranians.

1206
01:39:55,203 --> 01:39:57,914
But back in Tehran,
the hard-liners seized the embassy...

1207
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,666
and overnight,
the whole country changed.

1208
01:40:00,833 --> 01:40:04,462
People we'd been working with,
they turned on us. I got out.

1209
01:40:04,629 --> 01:40:06,839
My partner didn't.

1210
01:40:07,006 --> 01:40:10,802
By the time I got home,
the whole mission had become
a press disaster waiting to happen.

1211
01:40:10,968 --> 01:40:13,262
Aiding and abetting
the new enemy.

1212
01:40:13,429 --> 01:40:16,599
The agency conveniently
forgot I existed.

1213
01:40:17,975 --> 01:40:22,522
I don't blame them.
It's what they had to do.

1214
01:40:22,688 --> 01:40:25,942
I loved the agency.

1215
01:40:26,108 --> 01:40:29,362
I loved the work.
I loved the people.

1216
01:40:29,529 --> 01:40:32,323
It was my whole life.

1217
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:34,909
Your partner
was Rachel's father.

1218
01:40:35,076 --> 01:40:39,413
Yeah. The idea was--

1219
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:43,292
The idea always was that if one
of us got out, he'd take care
of the other's family.

1220
01:40:44,752 --> 01:40:48,422
Rachel was all he had, so she became
my promise to him.

1221
01:40:48,589 --> 01:40:51,342
- Here you go, hon.
- Thank you.

1222
01:40:55,972 --> 01:40:58,182
Maybe we can still keep
that promise in a way.

1223
01:40:58,349 --> 01:41:01,394
You're a threat now,
just like I was.

1224
01:41:01,561 --> 01:41:04,063
Threat to whom? To them?

1225
01:41:04,230 --> 01:41:06,941
To your family, to your friends,
everyone you know, everyone you meet.

1226
01:41:07,108 --> 01:41:11,612
That's why I went away and didn't
come back. You gotta go away, Robert.

1227
01:41:11,779 --> 01:41:14,448
No, I don't think so.
This is my life.

1228
01:41:14,615 --> 01:41:17,785
I worked hard for it,
and I want it back.

1229
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:23,291
I grew up without a father. I know what
that is. And I will not allow my family
to go through that.

1230
01:41:23,458 --> 01:41:26,878
Mommy, I don't wanna
go home.

1231
01:41:34,177 --> 01:41:37,430
Wanna take a poke at me? Come on.

1232
01:41:37,597 --> 01:41:40,141
I don't hit senior citizens.

1233
01:41:41,809 --> 01:41:44,312
Oh, come here, Babe. Come on. Hey.

1234
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:45,354
Come up here. Come on.

1235
01:41:46,689 --> 01:41:50,651
You know, in guerilla warfare, you try
to use your weaknesses as strengths.

1236
01:41:50,818 --> 01:41:53,237
- Such as?
- Well...

1237
01:41:53,404 --> 01:41:59,285
if they're big and you're small,
then you're mobile and they're slow.

1238
01:41:59,452 --> 01:42:01,037
You're hidden
and they're exposed.

1239
01:42:01,913 --> 01:42:06,542
You only fight battles you know you can
win. That's the way the Vietcong did it.

1240
01:42:06,709 --> 01:42:09,754
You capture the weapons and you use them
against them the next time.

1241
01:42:09,921 --> 01:42:13,591
That way they're supplying you.
You grow stronger as they grow weaker.

1242
01:42:15,218 --> 01:42:17,929
- Hey, try these.
- Can I have something else, please?

1243
01:42:18,095 --> 01:42:20,348
- Yeah. Here.
- N-Never mind.

1244
01:42:22,558 --> 01:42:26,395
- That's my best aloha shirt.
- Well, say "aloha" to it.

1245
01:42:35,404 --> 01:42:39,158
- Steve, how you doing?
- Howdy.
- Need some gear.
- Help yourself.

1246
01:42:39,325 --> 01:42:42,370
- Say hi to Bill.
- Hi, Bill.
- How you doing, Bill?

1247
01:42:43,955 --> 01:42:46,290
Steve, where's the two gigahertz
video transmitters?

1248
01:42:46,457 --> 01:42:48,835
Right behind you,
second shelf.

1249
01:42:49,001 --> 01:42:51,671
Steve? I thought you said
his name was Bill.

1250
01:42:51,838 --> 01:42:54,132
No. You're Bill.

1251
01:42:54,298 --> 01:42:57,635
- If I'm Bill, you're going to have
to let me know I'm Bill.
- I just did.

1252
01:42:57,802 --> 01:43:00,638
The, uh, president has not
committed himself...

1253
01:43:00,805 --> 01:43:04,684
but he does recognize
that we do need something in this area.

1254
01:43:04,851 --> 01:43:07,979
And I think he will come to see
that this bill will, in the end...

1255
01:43:08,146 --> 01:43:11,149
provide the kind
of security that this--

1256
01:43:11,315 --> 01:43:14,986
- What security?
- The kind of security he's gonna need.

1257
01:43:19,490 --> 01:43:24,412
Ah, here we go. Modified cell phone
interfaced with laptop computer.

1258
01:43:24,579 --> 01:43:27,623
- Creates an enormously powerful tool.
- What is that?

1259
01:43:27,790 --> 01:43:32,587
This is Congressman Albert's
home address and his cellular ESN.

1260
01:43:32,753 --> 01:43:35,882
Now, we reprogramme our phone...

1261
01:43:36,048 --> 01:43:40,636
with Congressman Albert's ESN,
and you know what we got?

1262
01:43:40,803 --> 01:43:43,139
Hi, sweetie. We just landed.
So, how are the kids?

1263
01:43:43,306 --> 01:43:45,892
- Melissa has a fever.
- She okay?
- She's fine.

1264
01:43:46,058 --> 01:43:48,978
- When will you have
some time to talk?
- Uh, about 30, 40 minutes.

1265
01:43:49,145 --> 01:43:53,858
- I'll be in suite 59, Lincoln Hotel.
I'll call you when you get in.
- You're a dangerous man.

1266
01:43:54,025 --> 01:43:57,236
Oh, shit.

1267
01:44:00,198 --> 01:44:02,533
Aw, shit.

1268
01:44:16,047 --> 01:44:18,216
- Say something.
- Excuse me?

1269
01:44:18,382 --> 01:44:21,636
- Louder.
- What are you talking about?
- That's good.

1270
01:44:24,013 --> 01:44:27,391
- Won't they look in there?
- That's the idea.

1271
01:44:27,558 --> 01:44:30,520
Great plan.

1272
01:44:30,686 --> 01:44:33,147
I've been a law-abiding citizen
my whole life. One day with you...

1273
01:44:33,314 --> 01:44:37,068
I'm sh-shooting... and breaking--

1274
01:44:37,235 --> 01:44:39,570
I have to go to the bathroom.

1275
01:44:39,737 --> 01:44:42,657
- Rest well.
- Thanks. Bye.

1276
01:44:44,450 --> 01:44:46,452
Good work, guys.

1277
01:45:04,804 --> 01:45:07,223
We got him.

1278
01:45:07,390 --> 01:45:10,143
Yeah, go for it,
Mr Congressman.

1279
01:45:15,565 --> 01:45:19,026
- I think you're too young
to watch this part here.
- Yeah, so is she.

1280
01:45:33,166 --> 01:45:35,835
Yeah, hello. Could you send somebody
up to my room, please?

1281
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:38,379
Yes, this is Christa,
the congressman's aide.

1282
01:45:38,546 --> 01:45:41,591
- Might be able to piggyback it
on top of this.
- How the hell am I supposed
to know what it is?

1283
01:45:41,757 --> 01:45:44,719
I'm just a congressman,
for Christ's sake.

1284
01:45:44,886 --> 01:45:50,433
Security expert tells me it's like
a-a PX-73 burst transmitter,
whatever the hell that is...

1285
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:54,020
except it's-it's
much, much more sophisticated.

1286
01:45:54,187 --> 01:45:58,149
Of course I'm going to send it down,
but that's-- That's not the--

1287
01:45:58,316 --> 01:46:00,985
Because I want to know
who in the hell put it there, Jim.

1288
01:46:12,663 --> 01:46:15,166
- Hi there. Hey.
- Hola. Si?

1289
01:46:32,225 --> 01:46:37,355
- The category, Barbara.
- You know, this is very irritating.
Get one channel and stay with it.

1290
01:46:40,525 --> 01:46:43,027
- Stop jumping--
- We're on TV-

1291
01:46:43,194 --> 01:46:46,239
- I told you to stop jumping around.
- We're on TV-

1292
01:47:02,588 --> 01:47:06,384
Okay, these are the ones
they wanted us to find.

1293
01:47:06,551 --> 01:47:09,303
They're all ours.
We made 'em.

1294
01:47:09,470 --> 01:47:12,265
Thomas, could
I see you a second?

1295
01:47:17,228 --> 01:47:21,399
Look, there's $140,000 here.
I have no idea where it came from.

1296
01:47:21,566 --> 01:47:25,403
- What are you talking about?
An extra 140?
- Yeah.

1297
01:47:25,570 --> 01:47:27,905
Look, it's right here.

1298
01:47:28,072 --> 01:47:31,200
Two separate $70,000 deposits
on the same day.

1299
01:47:31,367 --> 01:47:33,578
Yes, I see the deposits,
thank you.

1300
01:47:33,744 --> 01:47:36,956
- What I'm saying is
I have no idea where they came from.
- Tom.

1301
01:47:37,123 --> 01:47:41,461
I'm sorry. That was Shaffer. He wants
to see all department heads at 0800.

1302
01:47:43,671 --> 01:47:46,507
You're going in on Sunday.

1303
01:47:46,674 --> 01:47:49,343
- That's just great.
- Emily.

1304
01:47:50,595 --> 01:47:52,763
This is your separate account.
I have no idea--

1305
01:47:52,930 --> 01:47:55,349
By the way, who is Christa?

1306
01:47:58,352 --> 01:48:00,771
"Eternally yours"?

1307
01:48:03,733 --> 01:48:07,695
I want the entire history
of this device, from birth to abortion,

1308
01:48:07,862 --> 01:48:11,240
on my desk in two hours.

1309
01:48:11,407 --> 01:48:14,452
I want the name
of the tech who made it.

1310
01:48:17,330 --> 01:48:21,000
I want to know
who authorized its use...

1311
01:48:21,167 --> 01:48:23,920
who checked it out
from inventory...

1312
01:48:24,086 --> 01:48:26,672
and for what purpose.

1313
01:48:29,467 --> 01:48:32,720
Most important,
how on God's green earth...

1314
01:48:32,887 --> 01:48:35,932
it got into Congressman Albert's
hotel room.

1315
01:48:36,098 --> 01:48:38,810
Listen, people, everyone here knows
where this is going.

1316
01:48:38,976 --> 01:48:43,439
Now, if this was a legit op--

1317
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:49,737
If this was a legit op...

1318
01:48:49,904 --> 01:48:53,658
and I can't possibly see
how it could be, then so be it.

1319
01:48:56,077 --> 01:49:00,748
But if this was somebody's
unilateral wet dream...

1320
01:49:00,915 --> 01:49:03,334
then that somebody
is going to prison.

1321
01:49:05,545 --> 01:49:07,380
It's him.

1322
01:49:10,258 --> 01:49:13,427
- Yes?
- Thomas Reynolds?

1323
01:49:13,594 --> 01:49:17,014
- Who is this?
- I have that environmental study
you've been looking for.

1324
01:49:19,267 --> 01:49:24,147
- Can we discuss this in person?
- Be at the corner
of Iowa and Third at 3:00.

1325
01:49:24,313 --> 01:49:27,400
I'll be there at 4:00.

1326
01:49:28,651 --> 01:49:30,903
We have to get a confession out of
this guy, we have to...

1327
01:49:31,070 --> 01:49:33,823
get it on tape, and we have
to get it fast, okay?

1328
01:49:36,826 --> 01:49:41,038
Oh, you shouldn't have. This thing
must've cost 12, 13 bucks easy.

1329
01:49:41,205 --> 01:49:43,708
Now, they expect me
to be wired, all right?

1330
01:49:43,875 --> 01:49:45,960
So what they'll do
is they'll sweep me.

1331
01:49:46,127 --> 01:49:49,797
But once they're done,
I'm gonna give you the signal...

1332
01:49:49,964 --> 01:49:52,216
- and, uh, you turn the mike on.
- What's the signal?

1333
01:49:52,383 --> 01:49:55,094
Signal is putting, uh, gum in my mouth.

1334
01:49:55,261 --> 01:49:58,389
So after the signal, you turn
the mike on. T-Turn it on now.

1335
01:49:58,556 --> 01:50:02,059
- Let's try it.
- Okay, off. Off.

1336
01:50:02,226 --> 01:50:05,730
Good. Now, to be safe,
they'll also try...

1337
01:50:05,897 --> 01:50:08,608
to scan all the frequencies
to try to track you down.

1338
01:50:08,774 --> 01:50:12,111
Now, if these guys are good,
and they're probably very good,
in a location like this...

1339
01:50:12,278 --> 01:50:14,197
they'll have you
in five, six minutes.

1340
01:50:14,363 --> 01:50:18,367
So let's say in four minutes time,
after you turn that tape on...

1341
01:50:18,534 --> 01:50:21,120
regardless of what's happening,
you get out that door.

1342
01:50:21,287 --> 01:50:24,081
- Now, you got that?
- No.

1343
01:50:39,096 --> 01:50:43,184
Record. On-off.

1344
01:50:43,351 --> 01:50:45,520
All right,
let the games begin.

1345
01:50:47,230 --> 01:50:49,232
Hey there.

1346
01:50:51,984 --> 01:50:55,530
Edward Lyle. Policeman.

1347
01:50:55,696 --> 01:50:58,616
- Very clever.
- Why don't you call your friends over.

1348
01:50:59,992 --> 01:51:02,078
Pratt.

1349
01:51:07,708 --> 01:51:10,878
Step towards the fence for me.
This won't take a second.

1350
01:51:17,093 --> 01:51:19,303
He's clear, sir.

1351
01:51:19,470 --> 01:51:22,473
So, do you have the tape?

1352
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:26,102
- Yes, I have.
- Here?

1353
01:51:26,269 --> 01:51:29,272
- No.
- Then what is there to talk about?

1354
01:51:29,438 --> 01:51:33,943
- Money.
- Money?
- I was wondering why
I hadn't seen it on CNN.

1355
01:51:34,110 --> 01:51:37,155
Have you looked at the tape?

1356
01:51:37,321 --> 01:51:41,033
- What's on it?
- Your ugly-ass face is on it.

1357
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:44,245
It shows the death
of Congressman Hamersly.

1358
01:51:44,412 --> 01:51:46,497
The needle behind the ear.

1359
01:51:46,664 --> 01:51:50,168
- Three faces, readily identifiable.
- How much you want for it?

1360
01:51:50,334 --> 01:51:53,171
- 1.8 million dollars.
- What?

1361
01:51:53,337 --> 01:51:56,174
And my file cleared.
I want my life back.

1362
01:51:56,340 --> 01:52:00,178
My 1980 salary with cost-of-living
increases for the past 18 years.

1363
01:52:00,344 --> 01:52:04,474
- Plus interest.
- Oh, shit.
- Plus the retirement package
for executive level E-16.

1364
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:07,393
Comes to 1.85.
I rounded it down.

1365
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:10,146
And for this,
I get the tape and, uh, Mr Dean.

1366
01:52:10,313 --> 01:52:13,357
- Actually, it's Dean that has the tape.
- Aw, shit.

1367
01:52:13,524 --> 01:52:17,111
- So what does he want?
- He wants to know
why you killed the girl.

1368
01:52:17,278 --> 01:52:21,866
- What girl you talking about?
- I tried to explain it to him,
but I couldn't figure it out myself.

1369
01:52:22,033 --> 01:52:25,203
You're getting self-righteous on me?
Because I've seen your file.

1370
01:52:25,369 --> 01:52:28,039
- Not exactly a beacon of light.
- Yeah, I agree.

1371
01:52:28,206 --> 01:52:31,459
It's just that--
You kill Hamersly, okay.

1372
01:52:31,626 --> 01:52:33,711
I wouldn't have,
but I understand the argument.

1373
01:52:33,878 --> 01:52:37,965
But why the girl?
Just to get to some schmuck
who barely knows you're after him?

1374
01:52:38,132 --> 01:52:41,969
- Schmuck?
- We never had to deal with domestic.
With us, it was always war.

1375
01:52:42,136 --> 01:52:45,807
You won the war. Now we're fighting
the peace. It's a lot more volatile.

1376
01:52:45,973 --> 01:52:48,893
Does he take this long
doing everything?

1377
01:52:49,060 --> 01:52:53,564
Now we've got ten million crackpots
out there with sniper scopes,
saran gas and C-4.

1378
01:52:53,731 --> 01:52:58,569
Ten-year-olds go on the Net, downloading
encryption we can barely break,
not to mention...

1379
01:52:58,736 --> 01:53:01,405
- Aw, shit.
- instructions on how to make
a low-yield nuclear device.

1380
01:53:01,572 --> 01:53:04,867
Privacy's been dead for 30 years
because we can't risk it.

1381
01:53:05,034 --> 01:53:08,412
The only privacy that's left
is the inside of your head,
and maybe that's enough.

1382
01:53:08,579 --> 01:53:12,166
- Come on. Get him to say something.
- We've located subject.
Keep him talking.

1383
01:53:12,333 --> 01:53:17,338
You think we're the enemy of democracy,
you and I? I think
we're democracy's last hope.

1384
01:53:17,505 --> 01:53:21,050
- There's always going to be power.
- You shouldn't be there, Robert,
but if you are, get out.

1385
01:53:21,217 --> 01:53:23,928
They're onto us.
Get out and follow procedure.

1386
01:53:26,347 --> 01:53:28,266
Get out now, Robert.
Get out-

1387
01:53:45,950 --> 01:53:49,954
- You gonna shoot a policeman
on the street? You wouldn't get a block.
- Get in.

1388
01:53:55,501 --> 01:53:58,087
- Yeah?
- Tom?
- Emily, what is it?

1389
01:53:58,254 --> 01:54:01,591
- Tom, our Visa card's been cancelled.
I tried to use--
- Did you try the American Express?

1390
01:54:01,757 --> 01:54:04,302
-Yeah, I tried that, too, and it's not--
-Look, I-I-I can't deal with this
right now.

1391
01:54:04,469 --> 01:54:06,554
- I'll call you back.
- Tom, listen, I-- No, Tom--

1392
01:54:06,721 --> 01:54:11,559
Credit cards not working, huh?
Yeah, that can be a real
pain in the ass, can't it?

1393
01:54:20,818 --> 01:54:22,695
Come in.

1394
01:54:26,240 --> 01:54:28,242
- Asshole.
- Great plan.

1395
01:54:36,083 --> 01:54:40,171
Tell him
to give me the tape.

1396
01:54:40,338 --> 01:54:44,258
- What guarantees do we have if--
- None.

1397
01:54:44,425 --> 01:54:46,344
None?

1398
01:54:46,511 --> 01:54:50,473
Does everybody here know that you
killed Phil Hamersly and Rachel Banks?

1399
01:54:50,640 --> 01:54:53,935
This guy is going down, and he's going
to take all of you with him.

1400
01:54:54,101 --> 01:54:59,607
Trust me on this. Amah- Goddam-
Oh, you son of a bitch- You--

1401
01:54:59,774 --> 01:55:04,695
- Rachel Banks is not the issue.
- Oh, you bastard-
- Hamersly is the issue. He was killed
for a purpose. Now, where's the tape?

1402
01:55:06,572 --> 01:55:09,242
Oh-- Oh, shit.

1403
01:55:09,367 --> 01:55:11,828
Where's the tape?

1404
01:55:13,746 --> 01:55:15,915
- Tom-
- All right. All right.

1405
01:55:16,082 --> 01:55:18,751
- I'll-I'll give it to you.
- Thank you.

1406
01:55:18,876 --> 01:55:22,380
What are you doing, you moron?
That's our only leverage-

1407
01:55:22,547 --> 01:55:27,510
- For Christ's sake.
- I'm the moron? Me?
No, you're the moron-

1408
01:55:27,677 --> 01:55:31,681
- Where is it?
- Washington and Fourth.
- Washington and Fourth.

1409
01:55:39,355 --> 01:55:41,607
- That's my blender.
- So?

1410
01:55:42,942 --> 01:55:45,194
Fourth and Washington.

1411
01:55:51,450 --> 01:55:53,703
- Where is it?
- The restaurant.

1412
01:55:53,870 --> 01:55:57,582
11169 Fourth Street.
Stand by to enter.

1413
01:56:09,302 --> 01:56:11,179
Wait a second.

1414
01:56:12,847 --> 01:56:15,224
See if you can get
the plate on that van.

1415
01:56:15,391 --> 01:56:18,936
T-S-1-8-7-8-5.

1416
01:56:19,103 --> 01:56:22,940
- You go in with Pratt and bring it out.
- I don't think so.

1417
01:56:25,151 --> 01:56:29,322
- Oh, you don't think so?
- If I go in there
and I bring that tape out...

1418
01:56:29,489 --> 01:56:31,407
I'm a dead man.

1419
01:56:31,574 --> 01:56:34,535
We go together, you and me. And you
view the tape, you sign off on it.

1420
01:56:34,702 --> 01:56:39,415
They let Brill go, and you take the tape
home. Everyone has a Merry Christmas.

1421
01:56:39,582 --> 01:56:42,376
What assurances do I have
that you haven't copied that tape?

1422
01:56:43,753 --> 01:56:47,256
You think I want copies? That tape has
been the bane of my existence.

1423
01:56:47,423 --> 01:56:50,843
I wish the one that we have
was at the bottom of the Chesapeake.

1424
01:56:51,010 --> 01:56:53,387
I wanna go home.

1425
01:56:59,519 --> 01:57:03,314
- Give me a piece.
- Yes, sir.

1426
01:57:04,649 --> 01:57:07,193
All right, you and me.

1427
01:57:09,278 --> 01:57:12,782
And Pratt and Bingham.

1428
01:57:12,949 --> 01:57:16,119
Fiedler, get one of those
little cameras on Bingham.

1429
01:57:23,084 --> 01:57:26,546
Guess what.
It's a government vehicle. Shit-

1430
01:57:26,712 --> 01:57:29,799
I'm going in cold. If I need you,
Hicks will call it.

1431
01:57:34,804 --> 01:57:38,057
- You guys got some food
or something in here?
- Oh, behind you.

1432
01:57:50,153 --> 01:57:54,907
You're either incredibly smart
or incredibly stupid.

1433
01:57:55,074 --> 01:57:58,953
We'll see in a minute.
Watch out for the FBI.

1434
01:58:06,502 --> 01:58:10,214
- I'll be back to get my blender.
- Yeah, I'll have it gift-wrapped.

1435
01:58:14,051 --> 01:58:16,971
It's your show.

1436
01:58:17,138 --> 01:58:20,433
- Isn't that the guy that was here
last time? That labour lawyer?
- You're right.

1437
01:58:29,650 --> 01:58:32,111
- No, no. Thank you.
- You guys like the food?

1438
01:58:32,278 --> 01:58:35,281
- Yeah. It's good food.
- It's good food, huh? I made it.

1439
01:58:35,448 --> 01:58:37,950
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, sure you made it.

1440
01:58:38,117 --> 01:58:40,870
- Come on. Eat your food.
- I'm eating.

1441
01:58:41,037 --> 01:58:44,624
- Boss.
- Huh?
- Black guy's back with a couple creeps.
- Yeah, sh-show him in.

1442
01:58:51,672 --> 01:58:55,092
Hey, how you doing?

1443
01:58:55,259 --> 01:58:57,512
What's this, the FBI?

1444
01:58:57,678 --> 01:59:00,598
No, sir, Mr Pintero. This is
the gentleman you wanted to meet.

1445
01:59:00,765 --> 01:59:04,101
- Oh, that's him?
- Yep, that's him.

1446
01:59:04,268 --> 01:59:06,938
- So you made the tape?
- What?

1447
01:59:07,063 --> 01:59:10,399
Did you make the videotape?

1448
01:59:10,566 --> 01:59:13,319
Look, look. He wants it back.

1449
01:59:13,486 --> 01:59:17,031
Really? I don't give a shit
what he wants.

1450
01:59:20,118 --> 01:59:22,453
Could we have
some privacy, please?

1451
01:59:23,830 --> 01:59:26,916
Yeah, maybe we should.

1452
01:59:27,083 --> 01:59:29,961
- Maria, get the kids out of here.
- Come on, boys.

1453
01:59:32,004 --> 01:59:34,173
Get 'em out of here.
Go on.

1454
01:59:34,340 --> 01:59:38,886
Maria, come on- Get 'em out-
Come on- Uncle Paulie will take you
to the zoo later.

1455
01:59:41,055 --> 01:59:44,350
- Ooh, ooh, Hicks.
- What the hell's the matter with him?

1456
01:59:44,517 --> 01:59:47,353
No, no, no, no. Not on the equipment.
We gotta get him-- Okay.

1457
01:59:56,737 --> 01:59:58,823
Check this out.
Come here.

1458
02:00:00,283 --> 02:00:02,285
Tony, they just pulled
a guy out of the van.

1459
02:00:02,452 --> 02:00:05,580
He's puking and bleeding
all over himself.

1460
02:00:08,458 --> 02:00:12,253
Shit. It's a city cop.

1461
02:00:12,420 --> 02:00:16,215
Hey, Babe. Come on. Come on.

1462
02:00:16,382 --> 02:00:20,803
- Oh, yeah. Okay.
- Now, he's your friend.
You persuade him to give us the tape.

1463
02:00:20,970 --> 02:00:25,725
Hey, look. Number one,
he's not my friend.

1464
02:00:25,892 --> 02:00:28,769
- And number two, it's not his tape.
- Whose is it?

1465
02:00:28,936 --> 02:00:32,273
It's mine, okay?
It's mine. I bought it.

1466
02:00:32,440 --> 02:00:34,942
You sold it to him?

1467
02:00:38,571 --> 02:00:40,615
Now, you listen to me.

1468
02:00:43,659 --> 02:00:46,788
Who are you? What the fuck
you trying to do to me?

1469
02:00:46,954 --> 02:00:51,834
- Oh, this looks bad.
- I'm with the federal government.
- Oh, the federal government
made a videotape?

1470
02:00:52,001 --> 02:00:54,879
- You guys oughta get in there.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Listen.

1471
02:00:55,046 --> 02:00:58,633
Now, we can go get a warrant
and come back with the FBI,
take anything we want...

1472
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:01,928
arrest anybody that we want--
just give the man the videotape.

1473
02:01:02,094 --> 02:01:05,056
Hey, only one gonna get arrested here
is you, for felonious cocksucking...

1474
02:01:05,223 --> 02:01:07,642
with an attempt to swallow
the evidence, so shut your mouth.

1475
02:01:07,809 --> 02:01:09,977
And you, get the fuck
out of here.

1476
02:01:10,144 --> 02:01:12,605
Go get your warrant.
And until then, get out of my joint.

1477
02:01:12,772 --> 02:01:15,733
Come on. You gotta get in there-
God, there are gonna be
dead bodies all over the--

1478
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:18,194
- Shut up-
- Get in there- Get in there- Come on.

1479
02:01:18,361 --> 02:01:20,446
- Shit, forget it. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.
- Okay.

1480
02:01:20,613 --> 02:01:23,491
This is it-, This is it- Krug,
take the rear. Jamie, you're with us.

1481
02:01:23,658 --> 02:01:26,119
Jones, you're on the side entrance.

1482
02:01:26,285 --> 02:01:31,082
- So what are we waiting for?
Come on. Let's go-
- No. Tony says we wait
until they show up. We wait.

1483
02:01:31,249 --> 02:01:34,001
- Put the guns away.
- You put your guns away.

1484
02:01:34,168 --> 02:01:36,170
Put it away.
Put it away.

1485
02:01:41,425 --> 02:01:43,636
Put it away.
Put it away.

1486
02:01:48,850 --> 02:01:51,394
All right,
I'm putting it away.

1487
02:01:56,649 --> 02:02:00,236
- Now, what will it take
for us to get that videotape?
- The end of the world.

1488
02:02:04,323 --> 02:02:06,534
Let's go. We're leaving.

1489
02:02:06,701 --> 02:02:09,745
- Put the guns down now.
- Everybody, drop your weapons-
- No-

1490
02:02:42,278 --> 02:02:45,448
Go- Go- Go-
Out of the way- Out of the way-

1491
02:02:52,497 --> 02:02:55,374
- Get your hands up.
- You get your hands up-
Drop the gun-

1492
02:02:55,541 --> 02:02:58,294
- On your knees.
- Easy-Easy-Easy with this guy.
He's not one of them.

1493
02:02:58,461 --> 02:03:01,297
Easy, easy. Get up. Get up.
Get up. Come on.

1494
02:03:01,464 --> 02:03:05,343
- All right. Let's get
this place cleaned up.
- Not too stupid after all.

1495
02:03:05,510 --> 02:03:08,888
Let's go.
Let's move it. Come on.

1496
02:03:09,055 --> 02:03:11,265
Right there.
Somebody get the paramedics.

1497
02:03:11,432 --> 02:03:14,560
We need some paramedics in here.
We have 13 bodies in here. Let's go.

1498
02:03:27,114 --> 02:03:31,035
All right, listen up.
Get some IDs on these guys.
Let's get these guns out of here.

1499
02:04:01,399 --> 02:04:04,652
This guy is going down.
He's going to take all of you with him.

1500
02:04:04,819 --> 02:04:08,030
- Goddam-
- Rachel Banks is not the issue.

1501
02:04:08,197 --> 02:04:11,909
Hamersly is the issue. He was killed
for a purpose. Now, where's the tape?

1502
02:04:15,329 --> 02:04:18,583
- Why did you record it?
- Okay, uh...

1503
02:04:18,749 --> 02:04:23,504
first of all, we were there for
technical support. And, uh,
we had no idea--

1504
02:04:23,671 --> 02:04:26,883
- Do they know that Reynolds is dead?
- Yeah.
- They know all that?

1505
02:04:27,049 --> 02:04:29,844
- Right, but they're still stalling.
- They're still stalling.

1506
02:04:30,011 --> 02:04:32,263
- A tape.
- A tape of it.

1507
02:04:32,430 --> 02:04:35,308
- What did you think was going on?
- Oh, I thought it was an STO.

1508
02:04:35,475 --> 02:04:38,603
- STO?
- Standard Training Op.

1509
02:04:43,065 --> 02:04:46,903
Congressman- Rhonda Overby, CNN.
Does this mean the privacy bill
is dead, Congressman?

1510
02:04:47,069 --> 02:04:51,324
Uh, in its current form, yes,
but the issue is still
very much alive, I can assure you...

1511
02:04:51,491 --> 02:04:54,577
unless, of course, no one worries
about national security any more.

1512
02:05:04,003 --> 02:05:07,507
We knew that we had
to monitor our enemies.

1513
02:05:07,673 --> 02:05:09,592
We also have come
to realize that we need...

1514
02:05:09,759 --> 02:05:12,595
to monitor the people
who are monitoring them.

1515
02:05:12,762 --> 02:05:16,224
Well, who's going to monitor
the monitors of the monitors?

1516
02:05:16,390 --> 02:05:19,894
I wouldn't mind doing
a little, uh, monitoring myself.

1517
02:05:20,061 --> 02:05:23,981
Mmm. Yeah, and you got lots
and lots of monitoring to do.

1518
02:05:24,148 --> 02:05:27,527
Are you guys talking
about sex?

1519
02:05:27,693 --> 02:05:29,904
- Boy--
- Oh, no. It's time for dinner.

1520
02:05:30,071 --> 02:05:33,741
Get in there and eat your dinner.
No more hanging with Dylan.

1521
02:06:08,151 --> 02:06:10,695
Brill, you are one sick man.

1522
02:06:13,823 --> 02:06:15,992
Yeah, me too.

1523
02:06:18,244 --> 02:06:21,664
Ooh, you're gonna need
to get a tan on those things.

1524
02:06:26,294 --> 02:06:29,088
Congressman Sam Albert, how do we
draw the line-- draw the line...

1525
02:06:29,255 --> 02:06:32,216
between protection
of national security...

1526
02:06:32,383 --> 02:06:35,761
obviously the government's need
to obtain intelligence data...

1527
02:06:35,928 --> 02:06:40,433
and the protection of civil liberties,
particularly the sanctity of my home?

1528
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:44,061
You've got no right
to come into my home.
