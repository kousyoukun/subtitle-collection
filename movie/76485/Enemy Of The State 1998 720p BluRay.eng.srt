Come on. Come on

3
00:00:52,236 --> 00:00:54,295
Come on, mutt. Look at that ball. All right

4
00:00:54,438 --> 00:00:55,632
- Come on. Get that ball. Baah ! - [ Barking ]

5
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,737
There's no problem with that

6
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,805
Oh, goddamn it

7
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:04,473


8
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:07,641
What the hell are you doing here ? This is not the office !

9
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:09,475
- This is my private time

10
00:01:09,553 --> 00:01:11,020
- Five minutes

11
00:01:11,088 --> 00:01:13,921
No ! l said no Tuesday, l said no last week

12
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,822
and l'm gonna keep sayin' no till you hear me

13
00:01:15,926 --> 00:01:18,190
Five minutes, Mr. Chairman

14
00:01:18,862 --> 00:01:20,625
- lt's all l ask. Five minutes. - [ Dog Barking ]

00:01:21,932 --> 00:01:22,921
- You want some coffee ?

16
00:01:23,067 --> 00:01:25,592
- No, l don't want any coffee. l want to play with my dog

17
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:29,132
Look, l'm not asking you to vote for it

18
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:32,398
l know you can't. Just release your people

19
00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:34,537
Let them go the way they want

20
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:39,509
Telecommunications Security and Privacy Act !

21
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,950
lnvasion of privacy is more like it

22
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,051
You read the Post ?

23
00:01:44,788 --> 00:01:47,450
"This bill is not the first step towards the surveillance society

24
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,424
lt is the surveillance society."

25
00:01:49,493 --> 00:01:50,687
- Liberal hysteria

26
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:54,128
- Listen, l'm not gonna sit in Congress and pass a law that

27
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:58,167
lets the government point a camera and a microphone at anything they damn well please

- Phil. - [ Grunts ]

29
00:02:00,437 --> 00:02:01,096
Yeah

30
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:03,564
Look, l don't care who bangs who

31
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,733
what cabinet officers get stoned

32
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,602
But this is the richest, most powerful nation on earth, and therefore the most hated

33
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,909
And you and l know what the average citizen does not: that we are at war 24 hours of every day

34
00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:16,849
Yeah, yeah, yeah

35
00:02:17,755 --> 00:02:20,588
Do l have to itemize the number of American lives we've saved¡­

36
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:23,717
in the past 12 months alone with judicious use of surveillance intelligence ?

37
00:02:24,595 --> 00:02:26,187
Thomas, cut the crap

38
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,966
l've got three major employers in the Syracuse area alone¡­

39
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:32,763
who are gonna get just killed by this bill

40
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:37,632
l promise to get you funds equal to¡­

41
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,699
or greater than whatever those companies gave your last campaign

42
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:43,244
l'm not talking about campaign contributions, damn it

43
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:46,111
l'm talking about my constituents being out of work

44
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,111
Jesus, man ! Wake up !

45
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:51,982
National security isn't the only thing going on in this country

46
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:58,327
This conversation is over

47
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:01,096
l beg of you, Phil. Please don't

48
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:05,525
l've been there for you in the past, haven't l ? There have been times

49
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:09,766
personal situations, when you needed my assistance and my confidence

50
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,772
Are you blackmailing me, you ambitious shit ?

51
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:17,774
l'm sorry we can't find a common ground on this one, Congressman

52
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:19,704
People of your district are lucky¡­You're a good man.

53
00:03:20,517 --> 00:03:23,911
to have you representing them

54
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,458
Come on. [ Grumbles ]

55
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:32,984
Come on

56
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,836


57
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,898


58
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,035


59
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:29,738


60
00:06:29,738 --> 00:06:32,935
Let me fight management. Okay, l can accept that

61
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:35,743
But this is our own goddamned union leadership¡­

62
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:38,780
tryin' to railroad us into signing some sweetheart contract

63
00:06:39,414 --> 00:06:40,312
Look,

64
00:06:40,716 --> 00:06:45,210
everybody knows¡­that the mob has been controlling these guys since as long as l can remember

65
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:50,323
And now, uh-- down there tuning up my people  now we got Pintero's goons¡­

66
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:53,519
Well, first off, that's a Hobbs Act violation, probably a RlCO

67
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:56,325
- Hey, thanks. Great. - How you doing, Eddie? How's it goin'?

68
00:06:56,765 --> 00:06:57,561
- Robert Dean

69
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:58,998
- Tony O'Neill. Nice to meet you.

70
00:06:59,635 --> 00:07:03,230
A Hobbs and a RlCO. Ooh, baby, don't stop

71
00:07:03,805 --> 00:07:05,670
Sounds like you guys need a labor lawyer. 

72
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:07,302
What happened ?

73
00:07:08,677 --> 00:07:12,841
We were in Louie's two nights ago,l go to use the bathroom, and these two fuckin' guidos jump me

74
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,780
Uh, l prefer we use the term "ltalian-Americans."

75
00:07:17,252 --> 00:07:21,052
Eh, whatever, but they were really goin' to work on me. lt could've gotten serious

76
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:22,647
- But then Larry Cash came in and he went after 'em

77
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:27,092
- Larry Cash is in the hospital,with a broken jaw and a ruptured kidney

78
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:29,956
ls this becoming a criminal investigation, Robert ?

79
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:33,057
- Um, no, it would take years to see that thing through. - [ lntercom Beeps ]

80
00:07:33,435 --> 00:07:36,165
Besides, these people have families that are living through this every day

81
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:41,737
Hey, Julie, can we send a case of Chianti over to Larry Cash ?

82
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,674
- Larry Cash ?

83
00:07:42,744 --> 00:07:44,268
- Yes, he's at St. Luke's

84
00:07:44,346 --> 00:07:46,041
And send some flowers to his wife, Brenda. 

85
00:07:46,114 --> 00:07:47,103
They're both in the Rolodex.

86
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:48,110
Yes, Mr. Dean

87
00:07:50,752 --> 00:07:53,277
Well, why don't you guys just head on home ?

88
00:07:54,022 --> 00:07:57,617
l'm your lawyer. l'm in the process of dealing with these guido motherfuckers

89
00:07:58,293 --> 00:08:00,124
Pintero doesn't stand a chance

90
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,789
So, how's the trout ?

91
00:08:07,903 --> 00:08:08,961
- Tastes like fish

92
00:08:09,404 --> 00:08:10,393
- lt is fish

93
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:13,639
No, l mean it tastes like every other fish l've ever had

94
00:08:14,242 --> 00:08:15,300
Okay

95
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:22,946
this is the videotape you need to convince Pintero with  Brill's note said that¡­

96
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:24,683
And watch out for the F.B.l. 

97
00:08:24,753 --> 00:08:27,051
Brill says the place is under surveillance

98
00:08:27,422 --> 00:08:28,582
- So when do l get to meet him ?

99
00:08:29,224 --> 00:08:30,384
- Pintero ?

100
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,449
Brill

101
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:35,263
Never

102
00:08:36,898 --> 00:08:37,887
Okay. Um--

103
00:08:39,134 --> 00:08:41,830
Wow. That's not exactly the answer l was hoping for

104
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,063
And what was the answer you were hoping for ?

105
00:08:44,439 --> 00:08:46,100
Oh, l don't know. Soon

106
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:47,768
Uh, definitely sooner than never

107
00:08:47,876 --> 00:08:50,936
Bobby, why do we have to go through this every time ?

108
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:53,237
Brill talks to me, l talk to you

109
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:54,980
That's the way it works

110
00:08:55,283 --> 00:09:00,222
Well, pardon me for being with hiring someone that l don't know and l've never even met a little uncomfortable¡­

111
00:09:00,222 --> 00:09:01,655
Then don't hire him

112
00:09:07,295 --> 00:09:08,785
$10,000

113
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:12,061
And l'm also uncomfortable havin' to carry that kind of cash around

114
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:14,563
Well, this should lighten your load

115
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,805
l don't know if it's Brill's price that's goin' up or your commission

116
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,870
l take 15%, as always

117
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:23,000
Brill's fee varies with risk

118
00:09:23,211 --> 00:09:25,372
Maybe you'd be more comfortable using someone else

119
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:27,208
- What, other than Brill ?

120
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:28,809
- Other than me

121
00:09:30,085 --> 00:09:31,017
- What's wrong with you ?

122
00:09:31,086 --> 00:09:32,576
- Oh, there's nothing wrong with me

123
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:38,526
Just, you know, someone with whom¡­you don't have quite so complicated a history

124
00:09:41,296 --> 00:09:43,924
l like our history, and l like you

125
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,726
Tsk. l like you too

126
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:53,437
Look, l-l just want to make sure that l'm not breaking the law in any way

127
00:09:53,508 --> 00:09:54,372
- You're not

128
00:09:55,444 --> 00:09:56,877
- And how can l be so sure ?

129
00:09:58,447 --> 00:10:01,249
Because l wouldn't let you

130
00:10:01,249 --> 00:10:07,654


131
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:10,453
[ Dean ] So, Mr. Pintero, 

132
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:12,857
the guy on the left¡­is Carl Matthews

133
00:10:12,928 --> 00:10:15,664
president of Local 6650

134
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:17,222
And this is Dave Early

135
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:18,534
secretary-treasurer of the National

136
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,264
Oh, right there, you see-- you see the guy there ?

137
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,168
That's Hugh Simic. He administers the pension fund

138
00:10:24,606 --> 00:10:26,665
Hey, you're going to recognize this fellow right here

139
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:31,908
- [ Beeps ] - That's you. - Am l correct, Mr. Pintero ?

140
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:33,145
- That ain't me

141
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:36,207
- [ Chuckling ] - Let's watch a little more

142
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,880
- Take a picture of this

143
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:40,714
- Everybody say "money."

144
00:10:40,822 --> 00:10:41,948
Here comes a great shot right here

145
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,423
Everybody say "not guilty."

146
00:10:45,494 --> 00:10:47,121
- [ Dean ] Right here; here it comes. - [ Remote Control Clicks ]

147
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:49,394
- That's not you ?

148
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:51,466
- That ain't me

149
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:56,064
[ Chuckling ] Well, you know, that's actually really great news for me

150
00:10:56,138 --> 00:10:58,197
lt lifts a huge weight off of my shoulders

151
00:10:58,507 --> 00:11:00,270
Because the conditions of your parole specifically forbid you

152
00:11:00,342 --> 00:11:06,641
from having any contact of any kind with any union officials. - l know that

153
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:10,716
Well, l'm saying, so hypothetically, had that been you

154
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:13,646
l mean, you'd be headed back to prison for¡­

155
00:11:14,222 --> 00:11:16,986
fifteen-- l don't know-- maybe twenty years-- even more

156
00:11:17,526 --> 00:11:20,723
But, l don't know, that ain't you, as you so eloquently put it

157
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:22,625
Are you fuckin' with me ?

158
00:11:24,132 --> 00:11:25,156
Eloquently ? That's not me

159
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,560

Maybe l'll just, you know run this tape past the federal prosecutor

You know, they have really great VCRs down there

A lot of times, they can see things that we can't see

165
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:49,683
You ain't runnin' this by nobody

166
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:53,554
- What do you want ? 

167
00:11:53,929 --> 00:12:00,625
- My clients want to vote their contract up or down¡­as they see fit, without, shall we say, any outside influences

168
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:03,665
Okay. Sit down

Now sit your ass¡­down

l would like my clients to be able to exercise their constitutional rights

And if that happens, that tape will disappear forever into my private collection

along with the Zapruder film and the porno from Hitler's bunker

are in the process of removin Republican congressman

Phillip Hamersly of Syracuse, New York

206
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:35,311
[ Woman #2 ] This accident comes at a very untimely juncture

207
00:14:35,456 --> 00:14:39,119
since the congressman was working on a controversial piece of legislation, Dale

208
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:42,662
opposing the Telecommunications Security and Privacy Act

209
00:14:43,264 --> 00:14:48,099
Fire officials do tell me was by himself in the car that it appears the congressman¡­

210
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:49,659
We have confirmed that.

However, strangely enough his favorite dog, Bob, is currently with police

212

[ Woman #1 ] l understand there was a history of heart problems

213
00:14:56,076 --> 00:14:58,306
[ Woman #2 ] There was, in fact, a history of heart problems

214
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:01,837
ln fact, the congressman endured open-heart surgery just a couple of years ago

215
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:06,413
Homicide investigators have told me they did find a bottle of pills in his lap

216
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,723
That might mean that the congressman-- and l speculate here--

217
00:15:09,723 --> 00:15:13,761
may have suffered a heart attack before going into the Lockraven Reservoir

You may know that the congressman suffers from a heart condition

00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:45,079
- My God !

473
00:30:45,823 --> 00:30:48,587
l ran into him in a store, and he was upset about something

474
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,020
- About what ? 

475
00:30:50,094 --> 00:30:53,086
- l don't know Before we had a chance to talk about it, he ran out of the store

476
00:30:53,498 --> 00:30:56,126
and next time l saw him, he was dead

477
00:30:58,102 --> 00:31:00,434
Baby ! Come here

478
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,634
Ohh, l love you so much !

479
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:06,640
l love you, too, sweetie

480
00:31:09,213 --> 00:31:12,512
That's not even to mention the gangster that threatened to kill me today

481
00:31:12,884 --> 00:31:14,215
- Hah ! Very funny !

482
00:31:14,285 --> 00:31:16,116
- Oh, you think ? - Hilarious

483
00:31:17,455 --> 00:31:18,547
- Mmm. What'd you get me ?

484
00:31:18,689 --> 00:31:19,553
A bowling ball

485
00:31:20,858 --> 00:31:23,850
No more of that MSNBC terrorist talk. You're scaring the kids

486
00:31:24,028 --> 00:31:27,555
We'll be back with your phone calls for Congressman Sam Albert right after this

487
00:31:29,934 --> 00:31:32,698
- Tell me. - Zavitz is dead. So is Lenny, the guy from the paper

488
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:33,937
- What about the tape ?

489
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:35,438
- We found the original in Zavitz's apartment

490
00:31:35,807 --> 00:31:37,468
- The original ? - There was a copy

491
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:38,975
- There was a copy ? - l think so, sir

492
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,737
- Any more good news ? - They never made it to the paper, but there was a private contact

493
00:31:43,014 --> 00:31:45,141
- Who was that ? - Several indiscriminants and one primary

494
00:31:45,249 --> 00:31:48,582
- Who ? - Robert Dean, a D.C. labor lawyer

495
00:31:48,653 --> 00:31:50,746
Lives in Georgetown with his wife, Carla Dean. She's also an attorney

496
00:31:51,756 --> 00:31:53,656
She's with the A.C.L.U., as it happens

497
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:55,918
l suppose he could've given it directly to Bob Woodward

498
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:00,497
Maybe we dodged a bullet. Find out what Dean knows

499
00:32:00,565 --> 00:32:02,664
Make contact

500
00:32:02,934 --> 00:32:03,764
- Yes, sir

501
00:32:04,235 --> 00:32:05,702
- l hate doing this at Christmas

502
00:32:10,741 --> 00:32:11,605
[ Hicks ] Fiedler,

503
00:32:11,742 --> 00:32:15,375
we need a complete FinCEN, EPlC¡­and a DRD work-up on a Robert Clayton Dean

504
00:32:15,546 --> 00:32:18,572
His social's 986-26-0901

505
00:32:18,716 --> 00:32:20,377
Pull up keyhole data files, okay ?

506
00:32:20,485 --> 00:32:23,113
Let's go ! Let's get this show on the road !

507
00:32:24,055 --> 00:32:27,388
Eric, just call me in the morning when you want me to come pick you up

508
00:32:28,459 --> 00:32:30,361
You know, if you decide you want to stay at Dylan's¡­

509
00:32:30,361 --> 00:32:34,895
till the end of the weekend or the end of the century, your mom and l have discussed it

510
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:38,129
lt'll be difficult initially, but we think we can live with it

511
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:41,866
Dad's kidding. He's gonna miss you, just like me

512
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:45,008
Honey, 

513
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:48,135
hurry back. - You know what that means

514
00:32:48,546 --> 00:32:50,241
- Mmm-hmm. That you're gonna be asleep when l get back

515
00:32:50,314 --> 00:32:52,077
That only happened one time, sweetie

516
00:32:53,618 --> 00:32:55,984
[ Fiedler ] We're running a comprehensive database search

517
00:32:56,954 --> 00:32:59,422
Brian did a preliminary analysis and comparison

518
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,822
and he came up with some pretty interesting stuff

519
00:33:04,896 --> 00:33:06,090
Thanks, Brian

520
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:08,895
Thank you

521
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:11,795
Prioritize his phone bill

522
00:33:13,838 --> 00:33:14,770
Who's he been calling ?

523
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:20,436
- Oh, man. Check this one. - Who ?

524
00:33:20,678 --> 00:33:22,578
Rachel F-for-you-know-what Banks. 

525
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,375
God, would l love to have her ruin my life

526
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:25,447
Do a cross

527
00:33:27,018 --> 00:33:29,384
They were at Georgetown together, sophomore year

528
00:33:29,453 --> 00:33:32,286
They have the same address, same phone number

529
00:33:32,657 --> 00:33:35,285
They remain close. Many calls, regardless of marriage

530
00:33:36,928 --> 00:33:39,192
- [ Fiedler ] Oh, here we go. - [ Hicks ] What ?

531
00:33:39,263 --> 00:33:41,823
Dean, over the past 18 months

532
00:33:42,233 --> 00:33:45,964
has four, five, seven cash withdrawals of 4,000, 5,000

533
00:33:46,904 --> 00:33:49,270
and up, and up

534
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,375
and each time

535
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:54,944
the delectable Miss Banks makes large cash deposits of her own within a day or two

536
00:33:55,012 --> 00:33:55,808
- Blackmail ? 

537
00:33:55,913 --> 00:33:59,981
- Well, her deposits aren't the same but let me figure this out

538
00:34:00,218 --> 00:34:04,921
- [ Beeping ] - Oh, yes, they're exactly-- exactly 15% of the amount Dean withdrew

539
00:34:05,456 --> 00:34:07,651
Brian, can we get some more ? [ Whistles ]

540
00:34:08,726 --> 00:34:12,163
l mean, you know, we got the blimp cam, we got the police officer cam

541
00:34:12,163 --> 00:34:16,500
we've got two A.T.M. cameras, but this is the one showing promise

542
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,492
This is the security camera at the underwear store. Freeze there

543
00:34:20,938 --> 00:34:24,101
- [ Computer Beeps ] - Rotate us 75 degrees around the vertical, please

544
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:25,633
Freeze there

545
00:34:26,377 --> 00:34:27,344
Times ten

546
00:34:29,847 --> 00:34:30,939
Focus on the drop

547
00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:36,844
Enhance, then forward frame-by-frame

548
00:34:40,524 --> 00:34:42,492
All right. Now, 

549
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,255
just before the view's blocked, there's a shape change in Dean's bag

550
00:34:44,328 --> 00:34:46,353
See the shadow variance ? See ?

551
00:34:46,464 --> 00:34:50,230
The shadow's wrong. Zavitz changed the configuration of Dean's packages

552
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:52,133
- ls it a tape ?

553
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,861
- lt's hard to say for sure. These things are--

554
00:34:54,972 --> 00:34:56,166
- Can the computer take us around to the other side ?

555
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,735
- lt can hypothesize. Chris ?

556
00:34:59,076 --> 00:35:02,671
- Can you rotate us¡­Yeah ? 75 degrees around the vertical, please ?

557
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:07,750
- What do you think it is ?

558
00:35:08,252 --> 00:35:09,742
- lt looks a lot bigger than a tape

559
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,754
Zavitz had digital compression equipment in his apartment

560
00:35:11,822 --> 00:35:13,756
He could've downloaded it to anything

561
00:35:13,924 --> 00:35:15,824
Or maybe the bag twisted in Dean's hand

562
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,658
Or something moved in front of the light and altered the shadow. 

563
00:35:18,729 --> 00:35:19,661
Maybe it's nothing

564
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:20,822
Maybe it's everything

565
00:35:21,432 --> 00:35:22,729
Let's get it and find out

566
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,637
- Beat it. l got work to do. - [ Barking ]

567
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,531
Go. Porsche !

568
00:35:29,373 --> 00:35:30,533
Porsche

569
00:35:34,845 --> 00:35:35,903
- Go away !

570
00:35:36,747 --> 00:35:39,409
- [ Porsche Barking ] - Damn it, Porsche !

571
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:43,042
- Hello, Mr. Dean ? - Uh, yes. Can l help you ?

572
00:35:43,921 --> 00:35:45,855
This is Detective Benning. l'm Pratt. We're with D.C. Metro

573
00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:51,091
- Uh, sorry to bother you at home, sir. We were hoping to ask you a few questions about Daniel Zavitz

574
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:52,887
- Wh-- l'm s-- Can l see your badges, please ?

575
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:53,962
- Certainly, sir

576
00:35:54,031 --> 00:35:56,363
Sure

577
00:35:58,269 --> 00:36:00,169
All right. Come on. Back up, Porsche

578
00:36:04,408 --> 00:36:06,342
- All right. Nice and smooth. Come on. - Okay

579
00:36:06,744 --> 00:36:09,269
l didn't really see the accident. l don't know whose fault it was

580
00:36:09,346 --> 00:36:11,109
-We're not here to talk about the accident, Mr. Dean

581
00:36:11,582 --> 00:36:13,140
-l'm sorry, l thought you said--

582
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,081
[ Pratt ] We should apologize for the confusion, sir

583
00:36:15,186 --> 00:36:17,848
lt's just that we're handling a different aspect of the inquiry

584
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:21,286
lt turns out Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme

585
00:36:21,592 --> 00:36:22,581
- What kind of watch is that ?

586
00:36:24,195 --> 00:36:25,219
- lt's an Omega

587
00:36:25,429 --> 00:36:27,420
- So you're not constrained by attorney-client privilege ? - [ Barking ]

588
00:36:28,766 --> 00:36:29,698
- Shh-shh. Yeah, that's correct

589
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:31,860
- You see, Mr. Dean, we have reason to believe

590
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:34,437
that Mr. Zavitz may have passed sensitive materials to you

591
00:36:34,572 --> 00:36:37,105
- [ Growls ] - What kind of materials ?

592
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:39,699
[ Pratt, Over Speaker ] Well, sensitive, so we were hoping you could tell us that

593
00:36:39,977 --> 00:36:43,140
[ Dean Sighs ] No, he didn't pass me anything

594
00:36:43,214 --> 00:36:45,774
These voice stress points indicate a really high degree of anxiety

595
00:36:46,851 --> 00:36:48,341
Anxiety about what ?

596
00:36:48,819 --> 00:36:50,218
That's the nature of physics

597
00:36:50,287 --> 00:36:53,120
lf he'd given me something, l would've known

598
00:36:53,457 --> 00:36:54,685
- Oh, he's lying !

599
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:56,453
- What about your packages, sir ?

600
00:36:56,627 --> 00:36:59,363
Could something have slipped in amongst the purchases without your knowledge ?

601
00:36:59,363 --> 00:37:02,821
Excuse me. Daniel Zavitz did not give me anything

602
00:37:03,234 --> 00:37:04,064
- That's a Parker pen

603
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:05,995
- lt's a Mont Blanc

604
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:09,196
He didn't secrete it into any of my bodily orifices

605
00:37:09,406 --> 00:37:10,805
- Whatever it is, l don't have it

606
00:37:10,908 --> 00:37:11,897
- Could we look at them ?

607
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,077
l don't think so. Not without a warrant

608
00:37:14,411 --> 00:37:15,343
- Oh, Christ

609
00:37:16,013 --> 00:37:16,843
- This guy's good

610
00:37:16,947 --> 00:37:18,505
- How did you happen to be at Ruby's today ? 

611
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:22,517
- l was shopping for lingerie That's still legal, isn't it ? - You buying that for your wife ?

612
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:24,985
No, l was, uh, picking something up for myself

613
00:37:25,055 --> 00:37:28,183
You know, you'd be surprised¡­l do a little cross-dressing on the weekends.

614
00:37:28,259 --> 00:37:31,228
how a nice pair of edible panties can make a guy feel sexy

615
00:37:31,562 --> 00:37:32,961
We thought it might be for Rachel Banks

616
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:36,397
Good night, gentlemen

617
00:37:37,935 --> 00:37:41,167
- Good night, sir. - Good night, Mr. Dean

618
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,850
What are they talking about, Porsche ? There's nothing here

619
00:38:09,066 --> 00:38:11,227
Honey, l'm home

620
00:38:11,335 --> 00:38:14,771
- [ Door Shuts ] - Uh, yeah, just a second, sweetie

621
00:38:17,424 --> 00:38:23,680


622
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,410
Well, either he's getting ready to do something with it, or he doesn't know he has it

623
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,142
Or he doesn't have it

624
00:38:29,886 --> 00:38:31,080
You know what l've seen ?

625
00:38:32,289 --> 00:38:34,348
l've seen killers walk free¡­

626
00:38:34,424 --> 00:38:37,291
because the eyewitness was an alcoholic

627
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,523
l've seen sex offenders that couldn't be touched because the victim was a call girl

628
00:38:40,597 --> 00:38:41,757
Credibility-- 

629
00:38:41,898 --> 00:38:45,390
lt's the only currency that means anything on this kind of playing field

630
00:38:46,636 --> 00:38:48,297
Dean's got the tape, and he's gonna come out with it

631
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:51,169
And when he does, l want his credibility

632
00:38:51,308 --> 00:38:53,606
l want people to know he's lying before they hear what he says

633
00:38:53,743 --> 00:38:55,938
We could take his wife and kid. He'd give it up for them

634
00:38:56,112 --> 00:38:59,741
We'd have the police and the F.B.l. all over this in 24 hours

635
00:38:59,816 --> 00:39:03,081
Put taps on his 20 most frequently called numbers, and let's get into his life

636
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,150
The union situation has-has mob written all over it

637
00:39:06,256 --> 00:39:08,417
And he's definitely vulnerable on Rachel Banks

638
00:39:08,491 --> 00:39:10,982
l want to know about his wife, l want to know about his parents

639
00:39:11,094 --> 00:39:13,756
l want to know about his gambling problems, his urine samples, his porno rentals

640
00:39:13,997 --> 00:39:16,158
l want to use every means possible to get what we need

641
00:39:16,766 --> 00:39:19,758
Because this little son of a bitch is not going to be the final chapter of my life

642
00:39:25,842 --> 00:39:27,173
- [ Carla ] Tell me something. - [ Dean ] Uh-oh

643
00:39:28,311 --> 00:39:31,303
How did you find out Pintero was associated with union officials ?

644
00:39:32,015 --> 00:39:33,039
l'm just that good

645
00:39:34,084 --> 00:39:36,678
l hired an investigator

646
00:39:46,663 --> 00:39:49,826
- Hey. - Shut up the dog !

647
00:39:50,033 --> 00:39:51,330
My mom used to have one of these. Come on

648
00:39:51,901 --> 00:39:53,869
Ow ! The dog bit me !

649
00:39:54,571 --> 00:39:56,061
- Who was the investigator ?

650
00:39:56,473 --> 00:39:58,031
- Wh-What do you mean ? His name ?

651
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:02,011
Come on, Bobby. You know what l'm asking. ls it the guy who Rachel knows ?

652
00:40:04,447 --> 00:40:06,415
Why do-- Why do we have to go through this every time ?

653
00:40:06,516 --> 00:40:08,507
- Baby, l'm just asking, okay ? - Carla

654
00:40:08,852 --> 00:40:11,286
Rachel Banks is not an issue anymore

655
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:29,204
You are the only woman in the world for me

656
00:40:31,908 --> 00:40:33,170
You and Janet Jackson

657
00:40:33,276 --> 00:40:38,145
- [ Scoffs ] - l have to be honest. lf-lf Janet Jackson called me

658
00:40:38,281 --> 00:40:41,182
l w-- l might have to change my last name to Jackson

659
00:40:41,284 --> 00:40:42,683
- Yeah, right. 

660
00:40:43,019 --> 00:40:45,351
l'd have to break that woman's legs too

661
00:40:53,763 --> 00:40:55,162
- Lower, like kids would do it

662
00:40:55,265 --> 00:40:57,324
- You sound like a fuckin' old lady. Shut up

663
00:40:57,734 --> 00:40:58,632
Ooh, sensitive

664
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:02,931
Jones has some issues we need to resolve

665
00:41:06,443 --> 00:41:07,933
- Oh. Control, they are home. - Uh-oh

666
00:41:14,517 --> 00:41:15,347
Move, guys

667
00:41:17,053 --> 00:41:18,816
Oh, nice blender

668
00:41:25,395 --> 00:41:26,555
Oh, my God

669
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,599
- [ Barking ] - [ Carla ] Oh, Porsche

670
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:37,833
Oh, damn

671
00:41:38,108 --> 00:41:39,575
The dog is green

672
00:41:40,543 --> 00:41:43,205
[ Chuckles ] Jones painted the-- the dog !

673
00:41:43,813 --> 00:41:46,646
This is Robert Dean, 2811 Sutton. l'd like to report a break-in

674
00:41:46,783 --> 00:41:50,378
l don't know. lt's been vandalized. From the looks of it, i-it's kids

675
00:41:50,453 --> 00:41:52,284
but l need a squad car here immediately

676
00:42:01,331 --> 00:42:02,491
Here we go

677
00:42:02,766 --> 00:42:05,360
We'll be checking out the rest of the house, sir, ma'am

678
00:42:11,941 --> 00:42:13,602
At least they left me one

679
00:42:20,116 --> 00:42:21,845
How do you know it wasn't Pintero ?

680
00:42:22,585 --> 00:42:23,745
l don't. 

681
00:42:24,287 --> 00:42:25,584
lt was just kind of frivolous

682
00:42:25,655 --> 00:42:28,180
l guess l'm just hopin' it was kids

683
00:42:38,434 --> 00:42:39,093
John

684
00:42:39,169 --> 00:42:40,136


685
00:42:51,114 --> 00:42:52,308
What have we here ?

686
00:42:56,486 --> 00:42:57,714
l think we have a winner

687
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:01,723
Phone for phone

688
00:43:02,659 --> 00:43:03,990
[ Man ] Take any of your clothes ?

689
00:43:04,194 --> 00:43:05,252
No, 

690
00:43:05,361 --> 00:43:07,829
they threw all my shoes and suits in the tub

691
00:43:07,897 --> 00:43:09,762
and spray painted my damn dog

692
00:43:09,899 --> 00:43:12,697
- Black. - Black

693
00:43:13,436 --> 00:43:14,130
Perfect

694
00:43:14,771 --> 00:43:15,669
How does that look ?

695
00:43:15,872 --> 00:43:17,533
Paging Mr. Dean

696
00:43:18,441 --> 00:43:20,807
We have you bugged, Mr. Dean

697
00:43:21,277 --> 00:43:24,440
They thrashed my computers, my big-screen TV-- 

698
00:43:24,948 --> 00:43:26,006
They took my blender

699
00:43:26,216 --> 00:43:27,205
- What about jewelry ?

700
00:43:27,417 --> 00:43:28,543
- Nope

701
00:43:28,618 --> 00:43:29,812
- What about silverware ?

702
00:43:29,953 --> 00:43:31,978
- Nope. Just my blender

703
00:43:32,655 --> 00:43:33,349
- Blender, huh ?

704
00:43:34,424 --> 00:43:35,584
- Loved that blender

705
00:43:36,092 --> 00:43:38,253
You know, l did stuff when l was a kid

706
00:43:38,828 --> 00:43:40,853
l mean, not breaking-and-entering, but, you know, stuff

707
00:43:41,631 --> 00:43:44,998
Yeah, we all did stuff. l just wish they hadn't stolen my damn blender

708
00:43:45,602 --> 00:43:47,627
You seem a little attached to this blender, Robert

709
00:43:48,137 --> 00:43:51,766
Yeah, well, some people meditate, some people get massages

710
00:43:51,841 --> 00:43:55,902
- l blend. - You're really weird, you know that ?

711
00:43:56,913 --> 00:44:00,644
Yeah, then on top of it, the only suit they leave me is three years old

712
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:03,082
Hasn't gotten any better with age

713
00:44:05,722 --> 00:44:08,657
[ Dean ] Blow over ? l'm not gonna sit around and wait for this to blow over !

714
00:44:09,158 --> 00:44:12,889
Jerry, l-l'm suing their right-wing asses right into Chapter 11 !

715
00:44:12,962 --> 00:44:16,261
This is flagrant ! They never even called to see what my side of the story was !

716
00:44:16,332 --> 00:44:18,425
- [ Knock At Door ] - They have no Sullivan protection with this !

717
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:19,831
- Mr. Dean, 

718
00:44:19,936 --> 00:44:21,597
Rachel Banks is on line one. - Yes

719
00:44:21,671 --> 00:44:24,538
And Silverberg and Blake would like to see you in the conference room

720
00:44:24,641 --> 00:44:27,735
Uh, Jerry, l got to take this call. All right

721
00:44:28,311 --> 00:44:29,278
Hey, what's up ?

722
00:44:29,512 --> 00:44:31,946
My firm called me this morning telling me not to come in

723
00:44:32,081 --> 00:44:32,911
- What ? Why not ?

724
00:44:33,182 --> 00:44:34,342
- l don't know

725
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:37,783
Reporters are calling, asking me about my relationship with you¡­

726
00:44:37,854 --> 00:44:40,322
and how long l've worked for the mob

727
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:42,052
- The mob, Bobby

728
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:43,092
- Jesus

729
00:44:43,259 --> 00:44:45,159
- Do you know how hard l worked to get this job ?

730
00:44:45,361 --> 00:44:46,726
- Yeah, l know. l know

731
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:50,193
Mr. Dean, Silverberg and Blake are still waiting to see you in the conference room

732
00:44:50,266 --> 00:44:51,597
- l heard you the first time. Thank you

733
00:44:52,402 --> 00:44:53,562
- You got your own problems

734
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:55,501
- Uh, no, Rachel. lt's fine. - [ Phone Hangs Up ]

735
00:45:04,681 --> 00:45:07,081
l just got off the phone with a source that l trust

736
00:45:07,483 --> 00:45:11,442
A grand jury is being convened to look into your labor practice¡­

737
00:45:11,521 --> 00:45:13,489
as far back as the electrical workers' strike

738
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:15,320
And why is that ?

739
00:45:16,259 --> 00:45:19,660
They claim you helped create a shell company for Sam Villotti in Zurich

740
00:45:20,096 --> 00:45:22,360
And through your continuing relationship, the Peitso family has been able¡­

741
00:45:22,432 --> 00:45:28,428
to exert influence and provide false witness to discredit our case

742
00:45:29,105 --> 00:45:29,969
- Oh, well, that's true

743
00:45:30,406 --> 00:45:31,065
- You're admitting it ?

744
00:45:31,407 --> 00:45:32,396
Sure. 

745
00:45:32,475 --> 00:45:36,104
Everything except setting up a company in Zurich

746
00:45:36,179 --> 00:45:38,044
Or even knowing anyone named Sam Villotti

747
00:45:38,114 --> 00:45:42,016
Or having any relationship whatsoever to the Peitso family !

748
00:45:42,185 --> 00:45:43,413
This is ridiculous !

749
00:45:44,187 --> 00:45:45,381
- Robert-- - Mark, l'm telling you

750
00:45:45,455 --> 00:45:47,116
This is Pintero. He's coming back after me

751
00:45:47,256 --> 00:45:50,384
You give me one week-- one week and four guys from litigation

752
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,156
and l guarantee you, we'll have this guy begging us--

753
00:45:53,229 --> 00:45:54,628
Tell us about Rachel Banks

754
00:45:58,501 --> 00:45:59,661
Tell you what ?

755
00:45:59,836 --> 00:46:02,236
Uh, she was my girlfriend the second year of law school

756
00:46:02,305 --> 00:46:03,397
We keep in touch. We-We toss one another some work every once in awhile. That's it

757
00:46:03,473 --> 00:46:06,733
We keep in touch. We-We toss one another some work every once in awhile. That's it

758
00:46:07,077 --> 00:46:08,635
Did you have an affair with her four years ago ?

759
00:46:12,916 --> 00:46:14,508
You ever beat off in the shower, Brian ?

760
00:46:14,617 --> 00:46:17,711
Hmm ? You ever have any homosexual thoughts ?

761
00:46:17,887 --> 00:46:18,876
- Bobby, that is--

762
00:46:18,988 --> 00:46:20,922
- None of my fucking business ! !

763

absolutely, with no equivocations, 

766
00:46:27,597 --> 00:46:29,360
and that's none of your fuckin' business either

767
00:46:30,266 --> 00:46:32,564
Uh, we think that you should take a leave of absence¡­

768
00:46:32,669 --> 00:46:34,660
until we're able to, uh, sort all this out

00:46:34,971 --> 00:46:35,903
- Are you firing me ?

770
00:46:36,106 --> 00:46:37,630
- l think you just fired yourself

772
00:46:54,124 --> 00:46:54,886
Where is she, Jen ?

773
00:46:58,361 --> 00:46:59,919
Don't go in there. She doesn't want to talk to you

774
00:47:00,063 --> 00:47:00,859
- Why not ?

775
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:02,397
- Because she's reading the paper

776

00:47:08,538 --> 00:47:09,527
Carla--

778
00:47:11,975 --> 00:47:13,567
How could you let me find out like this ?

779
00:47:13,643 --> 00:47:15,235
l'm findin' out like this. This is all lies. 

780
00:47:15,311 --> 00:47:17,836
None of this stuff is true

781
00:47:18,047 --> 00:47:19,878
So you're saying you weren't there with her ?

782
00:47:20,049 --> 00:47:22,415
Yes, l had lunch with her. We have lunch once a month

783
00:47:22,485 --> 00:47:24,453
She's the contact for the investigator, Brill

784
00:47:24,521 --> 00:47:25,579
 You were right about that

785
00:47:25,822 --> 00:47:29,189
Someone must have taken this picture off the security camera outside the restaurant

786
00:47:29,292 --> 00:47:30,589
- You said she wasn't an issue. - She's not !

787
00:47:30,693 --> 00:47:33,321
l have to see her for business

788
00:47:33,429 --> 00:47:35,158
And l knew if l told you that--

789
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:36,892
Bobby, you had an affair with this woman ! An affair

790
00:47:37,066 --> 00:47:39,967
We went to a counselor for a year !

791
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:43,338
And now you're standin' there lyin' about even seein' her ?

792
00:47:43,606 --> 00:47:44,937
You make me sick !

793
00:47:46,476 --> 00:47:52,415
Carla, l am smeared all over the newspapers for money- laundering schemes, mob ties--

794
00:47:52,816 --> 00:47:53,942
l lost my job

795
00:47:54,617 --> 00:47:55,549
l am asking you

796
00:47:55,885 --> 00:47:59,946
l am asking you to please just trust me on this Rachel Banks thing right now

797
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:02,852
How in God's name can l trust you ?

798
00:48:03,827 --> 00:48:05,055
Bobby, l want you to leave

799
00:48:05,161 --> 00:48:07,152
Carla, l'm telling you that this is all bullshit !

800
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:09,061
l don't want to hear anything else

801
00:48:09,132 --> 00:48:12,124
l cannot think with you in my face. l want you to leave

802
00:48:12,235 --> 00:48:14,567
What do you need to think about ? l'm telling you it's bullshit !

803
00:48:14,637 --> 00:48:17,401
Just leave, so l can think ! For me, okay ? Just leave

804
00:48:17,473 --> 00:48:19,566
Just go, Bobby. Go

805
00:48:20,376 --> 00:48:22,105
Go !

806
00:48:25,081 --> 00:48:25,843
- You want a blend ? - Yeah

807
00:48:26,616 --> 00:48:31,104
Thanks

808
00:48:36,575 --> 00:48:39,408


809
00:48:39,578 --> 00:48:42,461
- Hi. - Hi. l'd like to have a room for the evening, please. Okay

810
00:48:43,967 --> 00:48:44,865
Thank you

811
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:50,298
- [ Computer Beeps ] - [ Woman ] l'm sorry, sir. This card was declined

812
00:48:50,607 --> 00:48:52,541
Declined ? This is a brand-new card. Try it again, please

813
00:48:52,809 --> 00:48:53,503
Yes, sir

814
00:48:55,879 --> 00:48:59,247
- [ Computer Beeps ] - You know, maybe it's not activated yet

815
00:49:00,283 --> 00:49:03,047
Thank you. Run this one, please

816
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:03,778
- Thank you. - Yes, sir

817
00:49:06,189 --> 00:49:09,420
No, it didn't go through

818
00:49:09,492 --> 00:49:10,789
- But l'll try it again. - No, thank you

819
00:49:12,795 --> 00:49:14,057
- My briefcase is gone

820
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:15,058
- Excuse me, sir ?

821
00:49:15,365 --> 00:49:16,627
- My briefcase was right here.

822
00:49:16,966 --> 00:49:19,457
- Are you sure you brought it in ?Yes, l'm sure l brought it in !

823
00:49:24,507 --> 00:49:27,374
Hi. This is Rachel. Leave a message after the beep

824
00:49:28,177 --> 00:49:29,940
- Hey, Rachel, it's Bobby. l need to talk to you, - [ Beeping ]

825
00:49:30,013 --> 00:49:33,683
and l need to talk to you face-to-face

826
00:49:33,683 --> 00:49:36,015
Meet me tomorrow, 11:00 a.m., Mount Vernon Square. 

827
00:49:36,386 --> 00:49:37,216
l'll see you then

828
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,584
Yes

829
00:49:46,596 --> 00:49:49,087


830
00:49:50,366 --> 00:49:52,300
All right, we're moving into phase two of the training op

831
00:49:52,368 --> 00:49:54,268
Selby's gonna brief you on it, so listen up, okay ?

832
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:57,498
We're gonna be following the subjects through the square

833
00:49:57,574 --> 00:50:01,776
We're gonna have three listening stations and two with unidirectional mikes  video surveillance units¡­

834
00:50:01,878 --> 00:50:03,072
Pratt, you're three. Jones, Fiedler, Krug

835
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:07,414
you guys are at ground level. You'll be following the targets

836
00:50:07,483 --> 00:50:09,610
You move when l say, you go when l say

837
00:50:09,953 --> 00:50:11,386
All handoffs go on my command

838
00:50:12,255 --> 00:50:13,483
Now, for the uninitiated, if we don't have line-of-sight

839
00:50:13,856 --> 00:50:17,888
we can't hear what they say, right ?

840
00:50:18,227 --> 00:50:18,921
- Right ?

841
00:50:19,095 --> 00:50:20,062
- Yeah. Got it

842
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:21,957
- All right. You guys clear ?

843
00:50:22,665 --> 00:50:23,324
- Yeah

844
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,600
Jones, Krug, what, are you guys from communications ?

845
00:50:25,835 --> 00:50:26,995
- No, we're ops

846
00:50:27,303 --> 00:50:28,668
- You can tell by their haircuts

847
00:50:30,922 --> 00:50:37,012


848
00:50:37,012 --> 00:50:40,140
l would like to sit down  with Mr. Pintero in private¡­

849
00:50:40,215 --> 00:50:42,183
so he and l can discuss what's happening to me

850
00:50:42,251 --> 00:50:43,548
l called; they said he was here

851
00:50:44,419 --> 00:50:46,410
Mr. Pintero would like to help you

852
00:50:47,756 --> 00:50:50,490
[ Chuckles ] But he won't

853
00:50:50,893 --> 00:50:52,121
- And why not ?

854
00:50:52,294 --> 00:50:56,061
- Well, first, you haven't told him¡­who made the tape, and second

855
00:50:56,164 --> 00:51:00,191
we've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars¡­

856
00:51:00,269 --> 00:51:02,499
on shyster lawyers just like you¡­

857
00:51:02,838 --> 00:51:07,104
because of shyster lawyers just like you

858
00:51:08,176 --> 00:51:11,009
Actually, l believe the slur "shyster"

859
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:14,071
is generally reserved¡­ for Jewish attorneys

860
00:51:14,182 --> 00:51:17,982
l believe the proper slur¡K for someone like myself¡­

861
00:51:18,053 --> 00:51:19,452
would be, uh, "eggplant."

862
00:51:19,821 --> 00:51:23,258
Boom. This kid gets brighter every time l see him

863
00:51:23,258 --> 00:51:26,921


864
00:51:27,529 --> 00:51:30,498
[ Rachel ] You said 11:00 sharp

865
00:51:30,498 --> 00:51:32,193
l know. Uh, Christmas traffic is horrible

866
00:51:34,369 --> 00:51:38,465
You know, it's not so smart, us being seen together in public like this

867
00:51:39,907 --> 00:51:41,067
- Do we have anything to hide ?

868
00:51:41,209 --> 00:51:43,040
- Heavy background on one. Can we do better on two ?

869
00:51:43,478 --> 00:51:44,502
- [ Rachel ] Unfortunately not

870
00:51:44,712 --> 00:51:45,371
- Two is better

871
00:51:46,381 --> 00:51:48,315
[ Rachel ] The l.R.S. contacted me this morning

872
00:51:48,483 --> 00:51:49,609
- Two, you're good. Hold position.

873
00:51:49,984 --> 00:51:55,121
- They say my lifestyle¡­exceeds my income. - Ohh. You're being audited ?

874
00:51:55,256 --> 00:51:56,746
For the last four years

875
00:51:57,225 --> 00:51:58,817
What's going on, Bobby ?

876
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,084
Uh, look, don't worry about that

877
00:52:01,162 --> 00:52:03,357
 My firm will represent you free of charge

878
00:52:03,664 --> 00:52:04,596
- [ Seth ] Eighty percent

879
00:52:04,832 --> 00:52:06,993
- You don't work there anymore, remember ?

880
00:52:07,168 --> 00:52:09,261
lt's a temporary situation

881
00:52:09,337 --> 00:52:11,362
- Your 80's becoming a 20. Move to audio three

882
00:52:11,439 --> 00:52:12,838
- On three. Much better

883
00:52:13,174 --> 00:52:14,163
- [ Rachel ] We're screwed

884
00:52:14,442 --> 00:52:15,340
- Wake up, one

885
00:52:15,777 --> 00:52:16,766
[ Rachel ] We are out

886
00:52:19,313 --> 00:52:20,143
Rachel

887
00:52:20,915 --> 00:52:22,314
l'm going to fix this

888
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:23,242
- How ?

889
00:52:23,451 --> 00:52:24,383
- Tell me about Brill

890
00:52:24,685 --> 00:52:27,017
- Did he say "Bill" ? - No, "Brill," with an "R."

891
00:52:27,455 --> 00:52:28,387
- l can't do that

892
00:52:28,589 --> 00:52:31,285
- Cross-reference Rachel's file. See if "Brill" comes up. - Got it

893
00:52:31,626 --> 00:52:35,084
Rachel, don't you see that he is the key to this whole mess ?

894
00:52:35,863 --> 00:52:38,798
From the second you gave me that tape, my life has been falling apart

895
00:52:38,966 --> 00:52:41,093
You assured me that this-this guy was legit

896
00:52:41,202 --> 00:52:43,534
- You needed information; l got it for you. - Two, you're good

897
00:52:44,906 --> 00:52:45,838
- Three is good

898
00:52:46,441 --> 00:52:48,602
- This conversation is over

899
00:52:48,843 --> 00:52:52,006
- Okay, here we go

900
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:53,478
- [ Dean Continues, lndistinct ]

- Two, you gotta do better

902
00:52:54,782 --> 00:52:56,784
- Shit. - You want your life back ?

903
00:52:57,385 --> 00:52:59,046
l don't have a life

904
00:53:00,288 --> 00:53:02,222
l'm in love with a married man

905
00:53:08,496 --> 00:53:10,123
Okay, l have 'em on the bench

906
00:53:10,231 --> 00:53:13,790
Rachel, l'm sorry, 

907
00:53:14,702 --> 00:53:16,033
but there's nothing l can do about that

908
00:53:16,771 --> 00:53:18,261
What makes you think it's you ?

909
00:53:21,509 --> 00:53:22,498
lt's not me ?

910
00:53:24,879 --> 00:53:26,870
l j-- l just as-assumed from--

912
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:31,550
- Yes. l know

913
00:53:36,057 --> 00:53:38,321
Rachel, you're gonna have to tell me about Brill

914
00:53:41,429 --> 00:53:42,361
Let's get out of here

915
00:53:43,531 --> 00:53:44,520
All right. They're on the move

916
00:53:46,234 --> 00:53:46,962
- Comin' to three

917
00:53:47,101 --> 00:53:47,760
- Stay with 'em

918
00:53:48,202 --> 00:53:50,261
- l got 40, 20--

919
00:53:50,404 --> 00:53:54,363
-[ Garbled Audio ] -You're following through trees. Two, can you track them ?

920
00:53:54,475 --> 00:53:57,103
l have lost line-of-sight. Repeat, l have lost line-of-sight

921
00:53:57,311 --> 00:53:58,300
- Three, you've got nothing. - l've lost line-of-sight. 

922
00:53:58,412 --> 00:53:59,709
l'm out

923
00:53:59,881 --> 00:54:02,577
We've lost audio; it's gone. But we still have his tracers. We can still follow 'em

924
00:54:03,217 --> 00:54:05,151
When l need to reach Brill

925
00:54:05,686 --> 00:54:08,348
l chalk the mailbox outside my house

926
00:54:09,156 --> 00:54:11,750
When he crosses the mark, l make the drop

927
00:54:11,993 --> 00:54:15,929
The location's always the same-- same time, same place

3:00 p.m. ferry to Gibson lsland

- [ Dean ] You ever see him in person ?

930
00:54:20,968 --> 00:54:22,435
- He's the cautious type. 

931
00:54:22,503 --> 00:54:24,562
He's not gonna like you trackin' him down

932
00:54:27,608 --> 00:54:29,633
The drop is behind seat 32

933
00:54:29,944 --> 00:54:33,175
l leave something; he picks it up later

934
00:55:27,101 --> 00:55:29,433
l'm sorry it took so long. l had to make sure you weren't being followed

935
00:55:31,238 --> 00:55:31,966
- Brill

936

Died of smallpox when he was two. Buried in a field in Kansas

938
00:55:37,144 --> 00:55:37,803

He's got nowhere to go

1177

He's crossed over. He's on the wrong side

l don't understand why this is so difficult

1194
01:12:51,044 --> 01:12:53,604
He shed the sensors. He's clever. And he's had help

1195
01:12:54,181 --> 01:12:55,580
- Maybe it's the real Brill

1196
01:12:56,116 --> 01:12:58,983
- There's 23 Brills in the Baltimore/D.C. area

- l know what you mean. - Let's raise the stakes

1203

Make things a bit more serious for Mr. Dean. We'll both think about how, okay ?

1204
01:13:17,971 --> 01:13:19,632
Okay. Good

1205

- No

1207
01:13:30,984 --> 01:13:34,977
You should have made deputy director two years ago, maybe three

1208
01:13:35,388 --> 01:13:38,516
But it'll happen now. Once this bill passes, that'll be it for you

1209
01:13:41,143 --> 01:13:47,933


1210

The house is bugged. Everything you say, they can hear and maybe see

1216
01:14:23,402 --> 01:14:25,302
Listen to me. Listen, listen

l never-- l swear to God. l never-- This is the truth

1218
01:14:27,506 --> 01:14:32,171
l never, ever since the problem, touched Rachel like that

1219
01:14:32,411 --> 01:14:36,279
l never even looked at her like that, honey. l love you

1220
01:14:36,515 --> 01:14:39,507
l love you, and that is it. That is it. Only you

1221
01:14:40,519 --> 01:14:41,816
What about Eric ?

1222
01:14:42,054 --> 01:14:43,487
And Eric

Except for your dad

l need you. l need you real bad. l need you, okay ?

1226
01:14:56,969 --> 01:14:57,993
Okay

1227
01:15:00,973 --> 01:15:02,133
l told you, Bobby

1228
01:15:03,242 --> 01:15:05,301
l told you they had this type of capability

1229
01:15:05,377 --> 01:15:08,869
And that goddamn privacy bill is just another way for them to expand the power

1230
01:15:09,014 --> 01:15:09,673
- Shh

1231
01:15:09,782 --> 01:15:10,908
- Don't you "shh" me

1232
01:15:14,587 --> 01:15:16,384
You were right. l was wrong

1233
01:15:16,455 --> 01:15:18,389
But this is not the time for the "l told you so" speech

1234
01:15:19,058 --> 01:15:22,994
That day when Daniel Zavitz got hit by the fire truck, he was running

1235
01:15:23,062 --> 01:15:26,327
The people that were chasing him, that's the people that are chasing me

1236
01:15:26,632 --> 01:15:27,997
- Bobby, are you serious ?

1237
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,100
- Go to Philadelphia, stay with your family

1238
01:15:30,169 --> 01:15:31,431
- Just give me time to work this out

1239
01:15:31,504 --> 01:15:33,096
- l don't think so

1240
01:15:33,172 --> 01:15:36,266
They're not chasing me out of my house

1241
01:15:36,342 --> 01:15:37,934
- l picked those drapes

1242
01:15:38,844 --> 01:15:40,539
- Shh, shh, shh. Nobody cares about the drapes

1243
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,805
Just one time can l make some decisions around here ?

1244
01:15:43,983 --> 01:15:46,679
Just go to Philadelphia. l need you to do that for me, okay ?

1245
01:15:47,553 --> 01:15:48,645
- Okay

1246
01:15:49,421 --> 01:15:50,615
- l miss you

1247
01:16:00,533 --> 01:16:02,558
- You can't wear that. That's a Christmas present. - l know. l'm sorry

1248
01:16:02,668 --> 01:16:05,638
But, baby, l missed you. l was lonely

1249
01:16:05,638 --> 01:16:07,970
How you just gonna go through my stuff like that ?

1250
01:16:08,174 --> 01:16:11,109
Until l actually give it to you, that's still mine

1251
01:16:11,443 --> 01:16:13,877
Yeah, but it looks better on me, don't you think ?

1252
01:16:15,848 --> 01:16:17,782
Baby, you're as bad as Eric

1253
01:16:18,684 --> 01:16:21,175
l missed you so much

1254
01:16:25,157 --> 01:16:26,021
- What ? - That was the night

1255
01:16:26,392 --> 01:16:29,850
That was the night that l came home with the presents

1256
01:16:30,196 --> 01:16:31,527
- Where is Eric ? - He's at Dylan's house

1257
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:35,427
He's probably on the way to school. What's going on ?

1258
01:16:35,501 --> 01:16:38,262
[ Gasps ] What are you doing with that ?

1259
01:16:38,771 --> 01:16:41,535
- Shh, baby. Shh, shh. - What do you want me to do with this ?

1260
01:16:41,607 --> 01:16:43,666
Get me some money. l need some clothes. Tell Maria we need her car

1261
01:16:43,776 --> 01:16:46,013
Chances are they wouldn't have bugged it. Oh, shit. 

1262
01:16:48,013 --> 01:16:49,251
Eric

1263
01:16:57,251 --> 01:17:00,489
Base, this is unit one.

1264
01:17:00,559 --> 01:17:02,550
The nanny is leaving- Please advise. 

1265
01:17:02,628 --> 01:17:05,392
- Stay put We have satellite tracking and Bingham at the school

1266
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,808
Aw, man, let me follow the nanny

1267
01:17:18,711 --> 01:17:20,542
She doesn't shave her legs. Jesus !

1268
01:17:20,613 --> 01:17:24,078
Women like that are so hot

1269
01:17:24,683 --> 01:17:26,207
- [ Dean ] ls there anybody following us ?

1270
01:17:26,285 --> 01:17:27,775
- No. No, Mr. Bobby

1271
01:17:27,953 --> 01:17:30,615
Drive a little faster. l wanna catch 'em before they get to school

1272
01:17:36,362 --> 01:17:40,162
- There they are. - Pull up and tell them to get into the car

1273
01:17:40,432 --> 01:17:41,558
Okay

1274
01:17:43,202 --> 01:17:45,534
Eric, Dylan, get in the car, please

1275
01:17:45,604 --> 01:17:46,571
- No, we're okay.

1276
01:17:46,639 --> 01:17:48,038
- Get in the car right now

1277
01:17:48,107 --> 01:17:49,938
- But school's right down the block

1278
01:17:50,776 --> 01:17:53,176
- You heard me. Now, get

1279
01:18:04,523 --> 01:18:05,512
- What's up, fellas ? - Dad ?

1280
01:18:06,058 --> 01:18:08,049
No. Turn around. Sit down. 

1281
01:18:08,394 --> 01:18:09,053
Face forward

1282
01:18:09,128 --> 01:18:10,891
- But, Dad-- - What did l say, Eric ?

1283
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:15,596
We're gonna play a game. Pick a spot and look right at it

1284
01:18:15,934 --> 01:18:17,959
You can't let anyone know l'm back here, okay ?

1285
01:18:19,004 --> 01:18:20,995
How you been, E. ? l missed you, man

1286
01:18:21,173 --> 01:18:23,607
l missed you, too, Dad. Where did you go ?

1287
01:18:23,942 --> 01:18:26,672
Oh, they've been keeping me really busy on this case

1288
01:18:26,945 --> 01:18:28,674
They're trying to work me to death

1289
01:18:29,214 --> 01:18:30,806
- Are you and Mom getting a divorce ?

1290
01:18:30,883 --> 01:18:31,872
- Face forward

1291
01:18:32,618 --> 01:18:35,416
What are you talking about ? No, we're not getting a divorce

1292
01:18:35,487 --> 01:18:38,581
We had a little fight. Sometimes married couples have fights

1293
01:18:38,691 --> 01:18:40,386
- That's nothing for you to worry about

1294
01:18:40,859 --> 01:18:41,848
- Who won the fight ?

1295
01:18:42,061 --> 01:18:45,189
This is your dad, Eric. When l put my foot down, that's it

1296
01:18:45,464 --> 01:18:46,453
- My mom won

1297
01:18:46,598 --> 01:18:49,032
- l have a question l need to ask you

1298
01:18:49,201 --> 01:18:52,193
lt is absolutely imperative that you tell me the truth

1299
01:18:52,604 --> 01:18:56,165
Now, no matter what you say, you are not going to get in trouble

1300
01:18:56,709 --> 01:18:58,301
- All right ? You ready ? - Yeah

1301
01:18:58,544 --> 01:19:01,240
You remember that night l came home with those Christmas presents--

1302
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:03,371
l just looked in the bag, Dad

1303
01:19:03,449 --> 01:19:05,781
l wouldn't have taken it, except it was already open

1304
01:19:06,118 --> 01:19:07,710
All right, 

1305
01:19:08,454 --> 01:19:09,386
so we're clear. But l need it

1306
01:19:09,455 --> 01:19:11,184
 l promise l'll get you another one

1307
01:19:11,457 --> 01:19:13,425
- Dad. - What's the matter ?

1308
01:19:13,492 --> 01:19:14,356
 lt's broken

1309
01:19:15,194 --> 01:19:18,322
lt's not Eric's fault, Mr. Dean. lt was always broken

1310
01:19:18,664 --> 01:19:20,825
The screen just scrambles when you turn it on

1311
01:19:20,999 --> 01:19:22,990
- But l need it. Do you have it here ?

1312
01:19:23,502 --> 01:19:24,833
- Yeah, we have it

1313
01:19:24,903 --> 01:19:26,996
Eric, just pass it around the side to me

1314
01:19:48,794 --> 01:19:51,695
[ Dean ] Yes. Hello. Hi. My name is Leon Newman

1315
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:53,491
l'm sorry. What's your name, ma'am ?

1316
01:19:54,032 --> 01:19:57,559
Sergeant Miller. Yes, we live at 454 Beaumont Terrace

1317
01:19:57,636 --> 01:19:59,866
Actually, my mother lives there. l'm calling for her

1318
01:20:00,038 --> 01:20:03,269
There's been a van sitting outside all day

1319
01:20:03,442 --> 01:20:05,808
l'm not trying to get anyone in trouble

1320
01:20:05,878 --> 01:20:08,745
but l think they might be doing drugs or something in there

1321
01:20:08,814 --> 01:20:10,543
l was hoping you could send a car by

1322
01:20:10,682 --> 01:20:14,486
- [ Beeping ] - Thirty-one Allison, all available units

1323
01:20:14,486 --> 01:20:19,814
Check out a white van at 454 Beaumont for a possible 1031 narcotics violation

1324
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:22,150
Oh, eat me. That's us

1325
01:20:35,690 --> 01:20:39,922


1326
01:21:00,165 --> 01:21:04,268
Rachel. Rachel

1327
01:22:23,282 --> 01:22:24,340
Oh, shit

1328
01:22:35,494 --> 01:22:37,325


1329
01:22:55,514 --> 01:22:57,243
- Open the door. Open the door !

1330
01:23:06,759 --> 01:23:08,659
l thought l told you to stay the fuck away from me

1331
01:23:08,761 --> 01:23:10,695
Please, not now. Just drive

1332
01:23:17,870 --> 01:23:18,962
- All right, what happened ?

1333
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:21,570
- Rachel's dead

1334
01:23:25,978 --> 01:23:30,642
l told you not to contact her. l told you

1335
01:23:35,821 --> 01:23:36,719
Get out of the car

1336
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:40,756
- l think l found what they're looking for. My son had it

1337
01:23:40,826 --> 01:23:43,090
- Get out of the fucking car

1338
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:26,303
Give me the toy

1339
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:37,348
You know why they killed her ?

1340
01:24:38,183 --> 01:24:41,946
Trying to make it look like it was me. They had my stuff planted all over her house

1341
01:24:42,788 --> 01:24:46,918
First, if you're a murder suspect, you're gonna be easier to find

1342
01:24:46,992 --> 01:24:50,428
and second, to discredit you, in case you ever go public against them

1343
01:24:51,263 --> 01:24:53,163
The N.S.A. set you up

1344
01:24:53,665 --> 01:24:55,132
lt had nothing to do with Rachel

1345
01:24:55,267 --> 01:24:58,100
Absolutely nothing

1346
01:25:05,143 --> 01:25:06,110
- What have we got ?

1347
01:25:06,178 --> 01:25:07,509
- We got nothing

1348
01:25:08,513 --> 01:25:10,242
Pull up everything we have on tape so far

1349
01:25:10,415 --> 01:25:12,349
The square, the house surveillance

1350
01:25:12,417 --> 01:25:14,612
Van, give me the sat imagery of the hotel roof

1351
01:25:15,921 --> 01:25:16,853
Okay, here. 

1352
01:25:17,256 --> 01:25:20,748
These are the parametrics for the space vehicle during data acquisition

1353
01:25:21,193 --> 01:25:23,559
Can we take a look at this guy who's helping him ?

1354
01:25:26,298 --> 01:25:28,266
Can you get a feature extraction ?

1355
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:31,168
Mm-mmm. He never looks up

1356
01:25:31,403 --> 01:25:32,335
- He's smart

1357
01:25:32,638 --> 01:25:33,764
- Why does he have to look up ?

1358
01:25:34,306 --> 01:25:37,833
The satellite's about 155 miles above the earth. lt can only look straight down

1359
01:25:38,143 --> 01:25:39,201
- That's kind of limited

1360
01:25:39,278 --> 01:25:40,870
- Maybe you can design a new one

1361
01:25:40,946 --> 01:25:42,538
Maybe l will, idiot

1362
01:25:45,918 --> 01:25:47,886
Stay put. l need some food. l need to eat

1363
01:26:07,406 --> 01:26:10,307
- Hello. - Yeah, it's me

1364
01:26:10,642 --> 01:26:12,906
- Oh, it's you, asshole. What are you calling me for ?

1365
01:26:13,178 --> 01:26:14,110
- Shut up and listen

1366
01:26:14,179 --> 01:26:17,239
Go to the house. Go. Do not call Carla

1367
01:26:17,582 --> 01:26:20,483
Rachel Banks is dead. The papers will make it sound like l killed her

1368
01:26:21,486 --> 01:26:23,317
Tell her that l didn't do it

1369
01:26:23,855 --> 01:26:27,518
Make sure she goes. Get her out of there. Tell 'em l love 'em

1370
01:26:27,893 --> 01:26:29,360
The call is coming from

1371
01:26:29,561 --> 01:26:31,461
 840 McClean, Baltimore

1372
01:26:31,530 --> 01:26:33,293
 between Hood and St. Anne's

1373
01:26:33,665 --> 01:26:35,030
Copy that. Yes !

1374
01:26:54,820 --> 01:26:55,809
What's up, man ?

1375
01:26:56,555 --> 01:26:59,046
We're gonna have to look at your surveillance tapes for the last 20 minutes

1376
01:27:00,959 --> 01:27:01,789
- Hey, Larry !

1377
01:27:02,361 --> 01:27:04,761
- The surveillance footage is coming in now from Pratt

1378
01:27:05,297 --> 01:27:07,288
Freeze it and process it for face recognition

1379
01:27:16,641 --> 01:27:19,371
Pratt, do we see which way the car went ?

1380
01:27:19,811 --> 01:27:23,042
No, sir. This kid here at the register thinks that it might have went south

1381
01:27:23,115 --> 01:27:25,015
Unfortunately, the shot's too tight

1382
01:27:25,317 --> 01:27:27,683
l got make, model and color, but the plates are phony

1383
01:27:27,753 --> 01:27:32,690
- Order satellite coverage on this sector. - lt's already done

1384
01:27:46,605 --> 01:27:48,874
- You planning a quick getaway ? 

1385
01:27:48,874 --> 01:27:50,273
- Yeah, ever since l met you

1386
01:28:12,698 --> 01:28:15,963
l hate to see the chicken that lives in this coop

1387
01:28:18,036 --> 01:28:18,934
This is where l work

1388
01:28:19,004 --> 01:28:20,631
Might seem strange to you,

1389
01:28:20,706 --> 01:28:22,367
This has been my office for 15 years

1390
01:28:22,941 --> 01:28:24,431
lt's completely secure. 

1391
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:27,843
Copper wire mesh keeps the radio signals out

1392
01:28:31,950 --> 01:28:34,783
[ Fiedler ] This is the satellite imagery of the convenience store

1393
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:36,819
- They're in El Camino. - [ John ] Eighty-six

1394
01:28:40,292 --> 01:28:41,486
- There it is

1395
01:28:41,827 --> 01:28:45,695
- John, give us LAT 30, 64 minutes, LONG 72, 29 minutes

1396
01:28:45,864 --> 01:28:50,028
- [ John ] That's affirmative. - [ Reynolds ] There they are

1397
01:28:50,135 --> 01:28:51,067
Coming in from top left

1398
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:56,698
[ Reynolds ] Let's get them

1399
01:28:59,211 --> 01:29:01,771
[ Brill ] l call it the jar

1400
01:29:02,447 --> 01:29:04,438
No phone or utility lines coming in

1401
01:29:04,716 --> 01:29:07,310
Self-contained. Unplugged from the world

1402
01:29:07,553 --> 01:29:09,953
Nothing for a wire bug to piggyback in on

1403
01:29:10,055 --> 01:29:11,955
That leaves transmitters. 

1404
01:29:12,357 --> 01:29:14,291
lt's easy enough to signal-sweep for those

1405
01:29:14,626 --> 01:29:18,187
Signal-sweeping for transmitters. You're just a party animal

1406
01:29:20,199 --> 01:29:24,695
The government's with the entire telecommunications industry since the '40s  been in bed¡­

1407
01:29:24,803 --> 01:29:26,293
They've infected everything

1408
01:29:26,505 --> 01:29:30,168
They can get into your bank statements, your computer files, e-mail

1409
01:29:30,242 --> 01:29:32,676
listen to your phone calls

1410
01:29:33,178 --> 01:29:35,009
- My wife's been saying that for years

1411
01:29:35,113 --> 01:29:37,343
- Every wire, every airwave

1412
01:29:38,283 --> 01:29:42,276
The more technology you use, the easier it is for them to keep tabs on you

1413
01:29:42,855 --> 01:29:44,686
lt's a brave new world out there

1414
01:29:45,023 --> 01:29:46,615
At least it better be

1415
01:30:04,209 --> 01:30:05,233
There it goes

1416
01:30:06,712 --> 01:30:08,304
lt's some kind of simple encryption

1417
01:30:09,147 --> 01:30:11,843
Oh, conspiracy theorists of the world, unite

1418
01:30:11,984 --> 01:30:14,976
lt's more than a theory with me. l'm a former conspirer

1419
01:30:16,455 --> 01:30:18,218
l used to work for the N.S.A

1420
01:30:18,857 --> 01:30:20,484
l was a communication analyst

1421
01:30:20,559 --> 01:30:22,891
Listen to international calls, calls from foreign nationalists

1422
01:30:23,395 --> 01:30:26,262
That G.P.S. tracking device we found in your cellular telephone ?

1423
01:30:26,331 --> 01:30:28,196
l designed one of the first models in that series

1424
01:30:28,333 --> 01:30:29,459


1425
01:30:37,009 --> 01:30:39,637
Fort Meade has 18 acres of mainframe 

1426
01:30:39,711 --> 01:30:42,179
computers underground

1427
01:30:42,414 --> 01:30:46,783
You're talking on the phone and you use the word, "bomb," "president," "Allah,"

1428
01:30:46,885 --> 01:30:48,614
any of a hundred key words, the computer recognizes it

1429
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:51,848
automatically records it, red flags it for analysis;

1430
01:30:51,924 --> 01:30:53,414
 that was 20 years ago

1431
01:31:00,432 --> 01:31:02,593
You know the Hubble Telescope that looks up to the stars ?

1432
01:31:02,768 --> 01:31:05,328
They've got over a hundred spy satellites looking down at us

1433
01:31:05,971 --> 01:31:07,336
That's classified

1434
01:31:07,406 --> 01:31:09,874
ln the old days, we actually had to tap a wire into your phone line

1435
01:31:10,842 --> 01:31:13,834
Now calls bouncin' around on satellite, they snatch right out of the air

1436
01:31:17,582 --> 01:31:18,742
What's this ?

1437
01:31:23,922 --> 01:31:27,790
- [ Dean ] That's Phil Hamersly. - Jesus Christ

1438
01:31:36,668 --> 01:31:37,430
Who's this guy ? 

1439
01:31:37,936 --> 01:31:39,995
l'm gonna check the executive N.S.A. files

1440
01:31:40,605 --> 01:31:42,095
Let's run the photo l.D. on him

1441
01:31:53,885 --> 01:31:56,149
Reynolds, Thomas Brian. Born 9-11-40

On loan from the State Department since '95

1445
01:32:02,627 --> 01:32:06,119
This guy's not a professional. He's a politician

1446
01:32:10,869 --> 01:32:13,030
Aw, shit ! Take that

1447
01:32:14,539 --> 01:32:16,473
- When was the last time you contacted somebody ?

1448
01:32:16,575 --> 01:32:17,633
- When we stopped for food

1449
01:32:17,709 --> 01:32:19,108
- Didn't l tell you not to use the telephone ?

1450
01:32:19,411 --> 01:32:20,844
- l called from a pay phone

1451
01:32:20,912 --> 01:32:22,072
- What did l tell you ?

1452
01:32:23,215 --> 01:32:24,375
- You told me no calls

1453
01:32:24,549 --> 01:32:25,914
l told you no calls

1454
01:32:27,219 --> 01:32:27,981
- Get the cat.  - Hey, man--

1455
01:32:28,387 --> 01:32:29,718
Get the cat

1456
01:32:31,189 --> 01:32:32,554
- What's the cat's name ?

1457
01:32:32,624 --> 01:32:33,488
- Babe

1458
01:32:33,558 --> 01:32:34,889
Come here, baby. Come here, baby

1459
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:37,551
Baby, come, come. Come here !

1460
01:33:02,587 --> 01:33:04,145
All right, baby, what do we got ?

1461
01:33:08,026 --> 01:33:09,357
What the--

1462
01:33:18,136 --> 01:33:19,034
- Subjects exiting

1463
01:33:19,738 --> 01:33:22,229
- Williams, get the hell out of there

1464
01:33:22,441 --> 01:33:23,465
This bitch is gonna blow !

1465
01:33:23,909 --> 01:33:25,240
Go, go, go !

1466
01:33:43,829 --> 01:33:46,593
Come on ! Go !

1467
01:34:13,225 --> 01:34:15,250
- What is happening ? - l blew up t he building

1468
01:34:15,327 --> 01:34:17,557
- Why ? - Because you made a phone call !

1469
01:34:27,806 --> 01:34:29,034
- Tell him to pull over !

1470
01:34:29,107 --> 01:34:30,506
- Pull the vehicle over now !

1471
01:34:35,747 --> 01:34:36,736
Pull over now !

1472
01:34:53,565 --> 01:34:54,463
Pump action !

1473
01:35:13,518 --> 01:35:14,485
Gosh damn !

1474
01:35:19,491 --> 01:35:20,651
Fuel line must be broken

1475
01:35:22,861 --> 01:35:24,123
- Get it out ! Goddamn !

1476
01:35:24,896 --> 01:35:25,794
- Stop the car !

1477
01:35:34,706 --> 01:35:35,638
- Where's the disk ? - Shit !

1478
01:35:37,809 --> 01:35:39,709
No ! Shit !

1479
01:35:40,478 --> 01:35:41,775
 Look, is there any way to save it ?

1480
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:43,142
- Ah, that's ruined

1481
01:35:43,481 --> 01:35:44,140
- What do we do ?

1482
01:35:44,616 --> 01:35:45,984
- l'm leaving.

1483
01:35:45,984 --> 01:35:47,645
- Subjects heading west across the coal fields

1484
01:35:47,919 --> 01:35:48,943
- You're leaving ? - The disk is gone

1485
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:51,511
We've got nothing. lt's over

1486
01:36:04,502 --> 01:36:06,993
We have control. Put down your weapons

1487
01:36:15,013 --> 01:36:18,779
You think l wanted that idiot to put that goddamn disk--

1488
01:36:18,850 --> 01:36:20,841
Who gives a fuck what you wanted ?

1489
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:24,111
Since you've shown up, Rachel's dead and the N.S.A.'s onto me

1490
01:36:27,959 --> 01:36:29,927
Onto you ? What do you mean onto you ? Onto you about what ?

1491
01:36:29,995 --> 01:36:33,797
You're not the target. l am

1492
01:36:45,677 --> 01:36:47,702
We got him. He's right in front of us

1493
01:36:50,582 --> 01:36:52,516
Come on, come on

1494
01:36:55,086 --> 01:36:56,747
We got him. He's got nowhere to go

1495
01:37:08,967 --> 01:37:11,231
Air One to ground, they're somewhere between the trains

1496
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,898
Get the fuck away from me

1497
01:37:18,877 --> 01:37:20,401
We're coming back around

1498
01:37:20,679 --> 01:37:22,044
- You're blowing my whole life

1499
01:37:22,314 --> 01:37:23,508
- What life ?

1500
01:37:23,581 --> 01:37:26,583
You live in a fucking jar¡­so the world can't touch you

1501
01:37:26,651 --> 01:37:28,585
And you didn't give a shit about Rachel !

1502
01:37:28,753 --> 01:37:31,221
Just some package under seat number 32

1503
01:37:34,192 --> 01:37:36,023
- Come on ! - Do you have a problem ?

1504
01:37:36,194 --> 01:37:37,821
- Go on ! Do it !

1505
01:37:39,230 --> 01:37:42,461
l'm all you've got ! And you're all l've got

1506
01:37:50,542 --> 01:37:52,407
Heading west towards the freeway

1507
01:38:03,888 --> 01:38:06,220
- Get out of the fucking car ! - All right

1508
01:38:07,025 --> 01:38:08,287
- Come on. Get out. - All right

1509
01:38:08,393 --> 01:38:09,690
- Don't do this to me

1510
01:38:09,761 --> 01:38:10,819
- Tell your story walking

1511
01:38:11,663 --> 01:38:13,028
Hey, wait a minute. Don't-- Oh, for God sakes

1512
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:15,593
- Thanks for your help back at the train. - Wait a minute

1513
01:38:21,406 --> 01:38:24,898
Air One to ground, l think we lost them. They're somewhere beneath the overpass

1514
01:38:34,753 --> 01:38:37,847
Well, you certainly carjacked a really nice car

1515
01:38:38,556 --> 01:38:40,820
This is a piece of shit. What are you talking about ?

1516
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:46,326
[ Sighs ] l need sugar, you know. l'm getting cranky

1517
01:38:46,998 --> 01:38:48,158
Getting ?

1518
01:38:49,034 --> 01:38:52,561
l'm hypoglycemic. My body can't metabolize the sugar, so--

1519
01:38:52,637 --> 01:38:55,504
So you're a pain in the ass when you don't eat

1520
01:38:55,940 --> 01:38:57,202
Basically

1521
01:38:57,909 --> 01:38:59,900
Yeah. Right

1522
01:39:00,311 --> 01:39:01,869
- We should eat then

1523
01:39:02,213 --> 01:39:03,202
- Let's do that

1524
01:39:04,315 --> 01:39:05,748
[ Hicks ] His real name is Edward Lyle

1525
01:39:06,151 --> 01:39:09,746
Graduated from Drexel University. Enlisted in the army, 1953

1526
01:39:09,821 --> 01:39:12,984
Rapid promotion, excelled at intelligence and communications

1527
01:39:13,058 --> 01:39:14,992
- Join N.S.A. in '65

1528
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:16,591
- Of course

1529
01:39:17,595 --> 01:39:20,598
He was in the agency till 1980 when he vanished and went underground

1530
01:39:20,598 --> 01:39:23,931
- Hasn't been seen since. - That's a long time

1531
01:39:24,002 --> 01:39:26,334
Lots of black bags, lots of deleteds

1532
01:39:26,671 --> 01:39:28,662
He's familiar with explosives, obviously

1533
01:39:29,741 --> 01:39:33,336
His last assignment, he went into lran, late '78, after the Shah

1534
01:39:33,611 --> 01:39:36,444
- This is our problem. - This man

1535
01:39:39,918 --> 01:39:45,190
So, we were helping the secret police supply weapons¡­

1536
01:39:45,190 --> 01:39:48,109
to the Afghani rebels fighting the Soviets. My partner and l were

1537
01:39:48,109 --> 01:39:51,029
on the eastern border monitoring Soviet military transmissions

1538
01:39:51,029 --> 01:39:53,896
lt was kind of fun actually. l liked the lranians

1539
01:39:53,998 --> 01:39:57,964
Back in Tehran, the hard-liners seized the embassy

1540
01:39:58,036 --> 01:40:00,436
and overnight, the whole country changed

1541
01:40:00,972 --> 01:40:04,135
People we'd been working with, they turned on us. l got out

1542
01:40:04,709 --> 01:40:06,199
My partner didn't

1543
01:40:06,945 --> 01:40:10,837
By the time l got home, the whole mission had become a press disaster waiting to happen

1544
01:40:10,949 --> 01:40:13,110
Aiding and abetting the new enemy

1545
01:40:13,585 --> 01:40:16,315
The agency conveniently forgot l existed

1546
01:40:18,123 --> 01:40:19,647
l don't blame them

1547
01:40:20,425 --> 01:40:22,086
lt's what they had to do

1548
01:40:22,727 --> 01:40:24,558
l loved the agency

1549
01:40:26,097 --> 01:40:28,759
l loved the work. l loved the people

1550
01:40:29,434 --> 01:40:30,833
lt was my whole life

1551
01:40:32,637 --> 01:40:34,901
Your partner was Rachel's father

1552
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:38,073
Yeah. The idea was--

1553
01:40:38,476 --> 01:40:43,311
The idea always was that if one of us got out, he'd take care of the other's family

1554
01:40:43,381 --> 01:40:48,353
Rachel was all he had. So she became my promise to him

1555
01:40:48,353 --> 01:40:49,684
- [ Woman ] Here you go, hon

1556
01:40:50,455 --> 01:40:51,319
- Thank you

1557
01:40:55,927 --> 01:40:58,122
Maybe we can still keep that promise in a way

1558
01:40:58,563 --> 01:41:00,793
You're a threat now, just like l was

1559
01:41:01,466 --> 01:41:03,161
Threat to whom ? To them ?

1560
01:41:04,035 --> 01:41:06,868
To your family, friends, everyone you know, everyone you meet

1561
01:41:07,539 --> 01:41:09,473
That's why l went away and didn't come back. 

1562
01:41:10,308 --> 01:41:11,605
You gotta go away, Robert

1563
01:41:11,910 --> 01:41:14,572
No, l don't think so. This is my life

1564
01:41:14,846 --> 01:41:16,905
l worked hard for it, and l want it back

1565
01:41:17,882 --> 01:41:19,782
l grew up without a father. l know what that is

1566
01:41:20,118 --> 01:41:22,518
And l will not allow my family to go through that

1567
01:41:22,654 --> 01:41:24,713


1568
01:41:24,789 --> 01:41:26,916


1569
01:41:32,463 --> 01:41:35,057
Wanna take a poke at me ?

1570
01:41:36,334 --> 01:41:37,392
- Come on

1571
01:41:37,835 --> 01:41:38,995
- l don't hit senior citizens

1572
01:41:41,873 --> 01:41:43,807
- Oh, come here, Babe. - [ Purrs ]

1573
01:41:44,409 --> 01:41:45,467
Come up here. Come on

1574
01:41:46,611 --> 01:41:50,103
ln guerilla warfare, you try to use your weaknesses as strengths

1575
01:41:50,715 --> 01:41:51,613
- Such as ? - Well

1576
01:41:51,916 --> 01:41:58,813
if they're big and you're small, then you're mobile and they're slow

1577
01:41:59,357 --> 01:42:01,018
You're hidden and they're exposed

1578
01:42:01,226 --> 01:42:01,749


1579
01:42:01,926 --> 01:42:04,010
Only fight battles you know you can win.

1580
01:42:04,010 --> 01:42:07,563
That's the way the Vietcong did it

1581
01:42:07,563 --> 01:42:09,865
You capture their weapons and you use them against them the next time

1582
01:42:09,865 --> 01:42:13,631
That way they're supplying you. You grow stronger as they grow weaker

1583
01:42:15,104 --> 01:42:16,264
- Hey, try these

1584
01:42:16,739 --> 01:42:17,831
- Can l have something else, please ?

1585
01:42:18,007 --> 01:42:19,201
- Yeah. Here

1586
01:42:19,442 --> 01:42:20,306
- Never mind

1587
01:42:22,511 --> 01:42:23,705
- That's my best aloha shirt

1588
01:42:25,147 --> 01:42:26,375
- Well, say "aloha" to it

1589
01:42:35,491 --> 01:42:38,153
- Steve, how you doing ? Need some gear

1590
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:39,156
- Howdy. Help yourself

1591
01:42:39,328 --> 01:42:41,660
- Hi, Bill. - Say hi to Bill. - How you doing, Bill ?

1592
01:42:42,465 --> 01:42:46,299
Steve, where's the two gigahertz video transmitters ?

1593
01:42:46,669 --> 01:42:48,500
Right behind you, second shelf

1594
01:42:49,171 --> 01:42:51,162
Steve ? l thought you said his name was Bill

1595
01:42:51,707 --> 01:42:53,436
No. You're Bill

1596
01:42:54,243 --> 01:42:56,006
- lf l'm Bill, let me know l'm Bill

1597
01:42:56,712 --> 01:42:57,610
- l just did

1598
01:42:57,713 --> 01:43:00,749
The president has not committed himself

1599
01:43:00,749 --> 01:43:05,152
but he does recognize that we do need something in this area

1600
01:43:05,254 --> 01:43:11,360
And l think he will come to see that this bill will, in the end, provide the kind of security that this--

1601
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,486
- What security ?

1602
01:43:12,561 --> 01:43:18,092
- The kind of security he's gonna need

1603
01:43:19,468 --> 01:43:20,594
[ Brill ] Ah, here we go

Modified cell phone interfaced with laptop computer

1605
01:43:24,507 --> 01:43:26,407
- Creates an enormously powerful tool

1606
01:43:26,909 --> 01:43:27,876
- What is that ?

1607
01:43:27,943 --> 01:43:32,539
This is Congressman Albert's home address and his cellular E.S.N

1608
01:43:33,048 --> 01:43:38,748
Now, we reprogram our phone with Congressman Albert's E.S.N.

1609
01:43:39,121 --> 01:43:40,554
and you know what we got ?

1610
01:43:40,789 --> 01:43:43,121
[ Albert ] Hi, sweetie. We just landed. So, how are the kids ?

1611
01:43:43,392 --> 01:43:44,654
- [ Woman ] Melissa has a fever

1612
01:43:44,727 --> 01:43:45,455
- She okay ?

1613
01:43:45,528 --> 01:43:47,928
She's fine. When will you have some time to talk ?

1614
01:43:48,163 --> 01:43:51,428
About 30, 40 minutes. l'll be in suite 59, Lincoln Hotel

1615
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:52,658
You're a dangerous man. [ Chuckling ]

1616
01:43:54,119 --> 01:44:16,324


1617
01:44:16,324 --> 01:44:17,222
- Say something

1618
01:44:17,459 --> 01:44:18,221
- Excuse me ?

1619
01:44:18,626 --> 01:44:19,285
- Louder

1620
01:44:19,627 --> 01:44:20,594
- What are you talking about ?

1621
01:44:21,029 --> 01:44:21,688
That's good

1622
01:44:24,232 --> 01:44:26,723
- Won't they look in there ? - That's the idea

1623
01:44:27,569 --> 01:44:28,968
Great plan

1624
01:44:30,638 --> 01:44:33,573
l've been a law-abiding citizen my whole life

1625
01:44:33,641 --> 01:44:36,804
One day with you, l'm shooting and¡­breaking-- 

1626
01:44:37,245 --> 01:44:38,473
l have to go to the bathroom

1627
01:44:38,580 --> 01:44:42,676
- [ Man ] Rest well. - [ Albert ] Thanks. Bye

1628

Good work, guys

- We got him. - [ Woman Sighs ]

1630

Yeah, go for it, Mr. Congressman

1631
01:45:15,617 --> 01:45:17,346
- You're too young to watch this part here

1632
01:45:17,886 --> 01:45:18,978
- Yeah, so is she

1633
01:45:33,134 --> 01:45:35,295
Yeah, could you send somebody up to my room, please ?

1634
01:45:35,937 --> 01:45:38,303
Yes, this is Christa, the congressman's aide

1635
01:45:38,473 --> 01:45:44,737
- How the hell am l supposed to know what it is ? l'm just a congressman, for Christ's sake

1636
01:45:45,313 --> 01:45:47,076
Security expert tells me¡­

1637
01:45:47,148 --> 01:45:50,879
it's like a PX-73 burst transmitter, whatever the hell that is

1638
01:45:51,052 --> 01:45:53,350
Except it's much more sophisticated

1639
01:45:54,055 --> 01:45:57,375
Of course l'm going to send it down. That's not the--

1640
01:45:57,375 --> 01:46:00,867
Because l want to know who in the hell put it there, Jim

This is very irritating

Get one channel and stay with it

who checked it out from inventory

1674
01:48:23,837 --> 01:48:25,498
and for what purpose

1675
01:48:29,243 --> 01:48:30,335

it got into Congressman Albert's hotel room

1678
01:48:36,349 --> 01:48:38,817
Listen, people, everyone here knows where this is going

1679
01:48:39,052 --> 01:48:41,486
Now, if this was a legit op--

1680
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:49,624
lf this was a legit op

1681
01:48:50,197 --> 01:48:53,462
and l can't possibly see how it could be, then so be it

1682
01:48:56,036 --> 01:48:59,528
But if this was somebody's unilateral wet dream

1683

then that somebody is going to prison

l have that environmental study you've been looking for

1689
01:49:19,259 --> 01:49:20,521
Can we discuss this in person ?

 on tape and fast, okay ?

1694

Oh, you shouldn't have. This thing must've cost 12, 13 bucks easy

1695

Now, they expect me to be wired, all right ?

1696
01:49:43,783 --> 01:49:45,614
So what they'll do is they'll sweep me

1697
01:49:45,919 --> 01:49:47,580
But once they're done, l'm gonna give you the signal

Putting gum in my mouth

1700
01:49:55,262 --> 01:49:57,321
So after the signal, you turn the mike on. Turn it on now

- Let's try it. - [ High-Pitched Squeal ] - Okay, off

they'll have you in five, six minutes

1707

01:50:18,451 --> 01:50:22,019
you get out that door. You got that ?

01:51:17,042 --> 01:51:18,066
He's clear, sir

1721
01:51:19,878 --> 01:51:21,311
[ Reynolds ] So, do you have the tape ?

1722
01:51:22,714 --> 01:51:23,612
- Yes, l have

1723
01:51:24,149 --> 01:51:25,241
- Here ?

1724
01:51:26,518 --> 01:51:28,543
- No. - Then what is there to talk about ?

1725
01:51:29,388 --> 01:51:30,116
- Money

1726
01:51:30,188 --> 01:51:31,018
- Money ?

1727
01:51:31,156 --> 01:51:33,750
l was wondering why l hadn't seen it on CNN. 

1728
01:51:34,059 --> 01:51:35,253
Have you looked at the tape ?

1729
01:51:37,496 --> 01:51:38,394
- What's on it ?

1730
01:51:38,497 --> 01:51:40,192
- Your ugly-ass face is on it

1731
01:51:41,199 --> 01:51:43,690
lt shows the death of Congressman Hamersly

1732
01:51:44,603 --> 01:51:46,503
The needle behind the ear

1733
01:51:47,039 --> 01:51:49,030
- Three faces, readily identifiable

1734
01:51:49,207 --> 01:51:50,196
- How much you want for it ?

1735
01:51:50,509 --> 01:51:51,908
- 1.8 million dollars

1736
01:51:52,244 --> 01:51:53,176
- What ?

1737
01:51:53,712 --> 01:51:56,112
And my file cleared. l want my life back

1738
01:51:56,415 --> 01:52:00,112
My 1980 salary with cost of living increases for the past 18 years

1739
01:52:00,252 --> 01:52:01,844
- Plus interest. - Oh, shit

1740
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:05,788
Plus the retirement package for executive level, E-16. Comes to 1.85

1741
01:52:05,957 --> 01:52:07,356
- l rounded it down

1742
01:52:07,793 --> 01:52:10,057
- And for this, l get the tape and Mr. Dean

1743
01:52:10,329 --> 01:52:11,796
- Actually, it's Dean that has the tape

1744
01:52:12,164 --> 01:52:13,256
- Aw, shit

1745
01:52:13,465 --> 01:52:14,557
- What does he want ?

1746
01:52:15,167 --> 01:52:17,032
- He wants to know why you killed the girl

1747
01:52:17,569 --> 01:52:18,866
- What girl you talking about ?

1748
01:52:18,970 --> 01:52:21,632
- l tried to explain it to him, but l couldn't figure it out

1749
01:52:21,973 --> 01:52:23,133
You're getting self-righteous on me ?

1750
01:52:23,375 --> 01:52:25,036
Because l've seen your file

1751
01:52:25,210 --> 01:52:26,643
- Not exactly a beacon of light. - Yeah, l agree

1752
01:52:26,712 --> 01:52:30,048
lt's just that-- You kill Hamersly, okay

1753
01:52:30,048 --> 01:52:33,711
l wouldn't have, but l understand the argument

1754
01:52:33,819 --> 01:52:35,309
But why the girl ?

1755
01:52:35,620 --> 01:52:37,918
Just to get to some schmuck that barely knows you're after him ?

1756
01:52:38,223 --> 01:52:39,019
- Schmuck ?

1757
01:52:39,091 --> 01:52:41,889
- We never dealt with domestic. With us, it was always war

1758
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:43,149
You won the war

1759
01:52:43,662 --> 01:52:45,653
 Now we're fighting the peace. lt's a lot more volatile

1760
01:52:45,897 --> 01:52:47,330
- Does he take this long doing everything ? - [ Purrs ]

1761
01:52:49,034 --> 01:52:51,161
Now we've got ten million crackpots out there

1762
01:52:51,236 --> 01:52:53,534
 with sniper scopes, sarin gas and C-4

1763
01:52:54,072 --> 01:52:55,664
Ten-year-olds go on the Net, 

1764
01:52:55,774 --> 01:52:57,708
downloading encryption we can barely break

1765
01:52:57,776 --> 01:53:01,371
not to mention instructions on how to make a low-yield nuclear device

1766
01:53:01,813 --> 01:53:04,805
Privacy's been dead for 30 years because we can't risk it

1767
01:53:04,950 --> 01:53:08,408
The only privacy that's left is the inside of your head. Maybe that's enough

1768
01:53:08,653 --> 01:53:09,950
- Get him to say something

1769
01:53:10,188 --> 01:53:12,088
- We've located subject. Keep him talking

1770
01:53:12,357 --> 01:53:14,848
You think we're the enemy of democracy, you and l ? 

1771
01:53:14,926 --> 01:53:16,257
We're democracy's last hope

1772
01:53:16,361 --> 01:53:20,391
There's always going to be power. You shouldn't be there, Robert. But if you are, get out

1773
01:53:21,366 --> 01:53:23,891
Get out and follow procedure

1774
01:53:26,271 --> 01:53:28,205
Get out now, Robert. Get out !

1775
01:53:45,891 --> 01:53:48,485
- You gonna shoot a policeman ? You wouldn't get a block

1776
01:53:48,861 --> 01:53:49,793
- Get in

1777
01:53:55,334 --> 01:53:56,733
- Yeah ? - [ Woman ] Tom ?

1778
01:53:56,902 --> 01:53:57,960
- Emily, what is it ?

1779
01:53:58,036 --> 01:53:59,936
- Tom, our Visa card's been canceled--

1780
01:54:00,005 --> 01:54:01,472
- Did you try the American Express ?

1781
01:54:01,540 --> 01:54:02,802
- Yeah, l tried that too

1782
01:54:02,875 --> 01:54:05,867
- l can't deal with this now. l'll call you back. - Listen, l-- No, Tom--

1783
01:54:06,812 --> 01:54:08,109
Credit cards not working ?

1784
01:54:08,714 --> 01:54:11,342
 That can be a real pain in the ass, can't it ?

1785
01:54:20,792 --> 01:54:21,588
Come in

1786
01:54:26,298 --> 01:54:28,061
- Asshole. - Great plan

1787
01:54:36,008 --> 01:54:37,236
- Tell him to give me the tape. - [ Laughing ]

1788
01:54:40,179 --> 01:54:41,339
- What guarantees do we have if--

1789
01:54:41,413 --> 01:54:42,107
- None

1790
01:54:44,383 --> 01:54:45,247
[ Lyle ] None ?

1791
01:54:45,450 --> 01:54:50,353
Does everybody here know that you killed Phil Hamersly and Rachel Banks ?

1792
01:54:50,722 --> 01:54:53,122
This guy is going down, and he's going to take all of you with him

1793
01:54:54,026 --> 01:54:55,015
Trust me on this. 

1794
01:54:56,395 --> 01:54:59,125
Aah ! Goddamn ! Oh, you son of a bitch !

1795
01:54:59,565 --> 01:55:00,657
Rachel Banks is not the issue. Hamersly is

1796
01:55:01,366 --> 01:55:04,494
He was killed for a purpose. Where's the tape ?

1797
01:55:09,107 --> 01:55:10,472
Where's the tape ?

1798
01:55:13,579 --> 01:55:14,511
- Tom ! - [ Cocking Gun ] - [ Dean ] All right

1799
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:16,877
- l'll give it to you

1800
01:55:17,649 --> 01:55:18,547
- Thank you

1801
01:55:19,218 --> 01:55:20,879
What are you doing, you moron ?

1802
01:55:21,086 --> 01:55:22,212
That's our only leverage !

1803
01:55:22,321 --> 01:55:27,384
- For Christ's sake. - l'm the moron ? Me ? No, you're the moron !

1804
01:55:27,459 --> 01:55:28,255
- Where is it ?

1805
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:29,749
- Washington and Fourth

1806
01:55:30,028 --> 01:55:31,495
- Washington and Fourth

1807
01:55:39,204 --> 01:55:40,136
- That's my blender

1808
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:41,503
- So ?

1809
01:55:42,841 --> 01:55:44,069
Fourth and Washington

1810
01:55:47,045 --> 01:55:51,582


1811
01:55:51,582 --> 01:55:52,344
- Where is it ?

1812
01:55:52,916 --> 01:55:53,610
- The restaurant

1813
01:55:54,151 --> 01:55:56,745
11169 Fourth Street. Stand by to enter

1814
01:56:09,099 --> 01:56:10,327
Wait a second

1815
01:56:13,003 --> 01:56:14,470
- See if you can get the plate on that van

1816
01:56:15,205 --> 01:56:18,265
- T-S-1-8-7-8-5

1817
01:56:19,009 --> 01:56:20,567
- You go in with Pratt and bring it out

1818
01:56:21,945 --> 01:56:22,843
- l don't think so

1819
01:56:25,215 --> 01:56:26,546
- Oh, you don't think so ?

1820
01:56:26,884 --> 01:56:29,045
- lf l go in there and l bring that tape out

1821
01:56:29,420 --> 01:56:30,409
 l'm a dead man

1822
01:56:31,322 --> 01:56:34,591
We go together, you and me. You view the tape, you sign off on it

1823
01:56:34,591 --> 01:56:37,822
They let Brill go, you take the tape home, everyone has a Merry Christmas

1824
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:42,194
What assurances do l have that you haven't copied that tape ?

1825
01:56:42,333 --> 01:56:47,171
You think l want copies ? That tape has been the bane of my existence

1826
01:56:47,171 --> 01:56:50,004
l wish the one that we have was at the bottom of the Chesapeake

1827
01:56:51,041 --> 01:56:52,702
l wanna go home

1828
01:56:59,450 --> 01:57:00,417
- Give me a piece. - Yes, sir

1829
01:57:04,488 --> 01:57:07,048
All right, you and me

1830
01:57:09,126 --> 01:57:10,457
And Pratt and Bingham

1831
01:57:11,695 --> 01:57:16,029
Fiedler, get one of those little cameras on Bingham

1832
01:57:23,006 --> 01:57:25,497
Guess what. lt's a government vehicle

1833
01:57:25,743 --> 01:57:26,437
 Shit !

1834
01:57:26,677 --> 01:57:29,612
l'm going in cold. lf l need you, Hicks will call it

1835
01:57:33,384 --> 01:57:36,478
You guys got some food or something in here ?

1836
01:57:36,787 --> 01:57:38,220
Oh, behind you

1837
01:57:49,967 --> 01:57:54,028
You're either incredibly smart or incredibly stupid

1838
01:57:54,905 --> 01:57:56,133
We'll see in a minute

1839
01:57:56,707 --> 01:57:58,470
Watch out for the F.B.l

1840
01:58:06,316 --> 01:58:07,578
- l'll be back to get my blender

1841
01:58:07,851 --> 01:58:09,045
- l'll have it gift wrapped

1842
01:58:14,158 --> 01:58:15,455
lt's your show

1843
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:19,190
- lsn't that the guy that was here last time ?

1844
01:58:19,363 --> 01:58:20,261
- You're right

1845
01:58:29,540 --> 01:58:30,871
No, no. Thank you

1846
01:58:31,108 --> 01:58:32,166
- You guys like the food ? - Yeah

1847
01:58:32,242 --> 01:58:33,334
- lt's good food

1848
01:58:33,410 --> 01:58:35,207
- lt's good food, huh ? l made it

1849
01:58:35,279 --> 01:58:37,076
- Yeah, yeah, sure you made it

1850
01:58:38,182 --> 01:58:39,114
- [ Pintero ] Come on. Eat your food. - l am

1851
01:58:40,918 --> 01:58:42,783
- Boss, black guy's back with a couple creeps

1852
01:58:42,886 --> 01:58:44,376
- Yeah, show him in

1853
01:58:51,462 --> 01:58:53,521
[ Pintero ] Hey, how you doing ?

1854
01:58:53,797 --> 01:58:55,865
What's this, the F.B.l. ?

1855
01:58:57,568 --> 01:59:00,628
No, sir, Mr. Pintero. This is the gentleman you wanted to meet

1856
01:59:00,704 --> 01:59:01,534
- Oh, that's him ?

1857
01:59:02,539 --> 01:59:03,369
- Yep, that's him

1858
01:59:04,041 --> 01:59:04,905
- So you made the tape ?

1859
01:59:05,843 --> 01:59:06,775
- What ?

1860
01:59:06,977 --> 01:59:10,242
Did you make the videotape ?

1861
01:59:10,380 --> 01:59:13,213
Look, he wants it back

1862
01:59:13,484 --> 01:59:14,644
Really ?

1863
01:59:15,252 --> 01:59:16,879
 l don't give a shit what he wants

1864
01:59:19,923 --> 01:59:22,255
Could we have some privacy, please ?

1865
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:24,988
Yeah, maybe we should

1866
01:59:27,130 --> 01:59:28,461
- Get the kids out of here

1867
01:59:29,132 --> 01:59:29,860
- Come on, boys

1868
01:59:31,935 --> 01:59:32,833
Get 'em out of here. Go on

1869
01:59:32,970 --> 01:59:34,870
Come on !

1870
01:59:35,038 --> 01:59:38,405
 Uncle Paulie will take you to the zoo later

1871
01:59:41,245 --> 01:59:42,234
- Ooh, ooh, Hicks

1872
01:59:42,412 --> 01:59:43,401
- What the hell's the matter with him ?

1873
01:59:44,348 --> 01:59:47,181
- [ Retching ] - No, not on the equipment. We gotta get him-- Okay

1874
01:59:56,827 --> 01:59:58,226
Check this out. Come here

1875
02:00:00,097 --> 02:00:02,361
Tony, they just pulled a guy out of the van

1876
02:00:02,432 --> 02:00:04,161
He's puking and bleeding all over himself

1877
02:00:08,472 --> 02:00:09,837
- Shit. lt's a city cop. - [ Door Opens ]

1878
02:00:12,309 --> 02:00:14,436
Hey, Babe

1880
02:00:20,817 --> 02:00:21,977

1881
02:00:22,786 --> 02:00:25,550
Number one: He's not my friend

Who are you ? What the fuck you trying to do to me ?

1888
02:00:46,843 --> 02:00:47,867
- Oh, this looks bad

1889
02:00:48,111 --> 02:00:49,669
- l'm with the federal government

1890
02:00:49,746 --> 02:00:51,680
The federal government made a videotape ?

1891
02:00:52,182 --> 02:00:53,581
- You guys oughta get in there

1892
02:00:53,650 --> 02:00:54,742
- Wait a minute. Listen

1893
02:00:55,586 --> 02:00:58,589
Now, we can go get a warrant and come back with the F.B.l., take anything we want

1894
02:00:58,589 --> 02:01:01,820

1895
02:01:01,925 --> 02:01:04,394
Only one gonna  get arrested here is you¡­

1896
02:01:04,394 --> 02:01:07,522

1897
02:01:07,931 --> 02:01:09,899
And you, get the fuck out of here

1898

Go get your warrant. Until then, get out of my joint

1899
02:01:12,636 --> 02:01:15,696
You gotta get in there ! They're gonna be dead bodies all over the place !

1900
02:01:15,872 --> 02:01:18,204

1901
02:01:18,675 --> 02:01:20,108
- Okay, let's go. - This is it. This is it

1902
02:01:20,377 --> 02:01:24,779
Krug, take the rear. Jones, you're in the side entrance

1903
02:01:26,149 --> 02:01:28,117
What are we waiting for ? Come on; let's go !

1904
02:01:28,285 --> 02:01:30,913
Tony says we wait until they show up

1905
02:01:31,088 --> 02:01:32,077
- Put the guns away

1906
02:01:32,322 --> 02:01:33,289
- You put your guns away

1907
02:01:33,991 --> 02:01:34,650
Put it away

1908
02:01:35,192 --> 02:01:36,090
Put it away

1909
02:01:41,231 --> 02:01:42,095
Put it away. Put it away

1910
02:01:47,571 --> 02:01:50,301
All right, l'm putting it away

1911
02:01:56,446 --> 02:01:58,539
- Now, what will it take for us to get that videotape ?

1912
02:01:59,116 --> 02:02:00,105
- The end of the world

1913
02:02:04,621 --> 02:02:06,490
Let's go. We're leaving

1914
02:02:06,490 --> 02:02:09,653
- Put the guns down now. - Drop your weapons ! - No !

1915
02:02:42,492 --> 02:02:43,925

You get your hands up ! Drop the gun !On your knees.Easy with this guy. He's not one of them

1918
02:02:58,608 --> 02:03:01,133
Easy, easy. Get up. Come on

1919
02:03:01,311 --> 02:03:03,176
- Let's get this place cleaned up

1920
02:03:03,346 --> 02:03:05,211
- Not too stupid after all

1921
02:03:05,315 --> 02:03:07,715
Let's go. Let's move it. Come on

1922
02:03:07,784 --> 02:03:11,618


1923
02:03:11,722 --> 02:03:14,418
We need some paramedics in here. We have 13 bodies in here

1924
02:03:27,037 --> 02:03:30,837
All right, listen up. Get some l.D.s on these guys. Get these guns out of here

1925
02:03:56,150 --> 02:04:01,505


1926
02:04:01,505 --> 02:04:04,235
[ Lyle, On Tape ] This guy is going down. He's going to take all of you with him

1927
02:04:04,808 --> 02:04:05,968
- [ Gunshot ] - [ Lyle ] Goddamn !

1928
02:04:06,043 --> 02:04:07,874
- Rachel Banks is not the issue

1929
02:04:07,945 --> 02:04:11,745
Hamersly is the issue. He was killed for a purpose. Now, where's the tape ?

1930
02:04:15,152 --> 02:04:16,244
Why did you record it ?

1931
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:21,314
Okay, uh, first of all, we were there for technical support

1932
02:04:21,692 --> 02:04:23,421
- And, uh, we had no idea--

1933
02:04:23,527 --> 02:04:25,188
- Do they know that Reynolds is dead ?

1934
02:04:25,262 --> 02:04:26,991
- Yeah. - They know all that ? - Right

1935
02:04:27,064 --> 02:04:29,191
But they're still stalling

1936
02:04:30,067 --> 02:04:32,035
- A tape. - A tape of it

1937
02:04:32,369 --> 02:04:33,666
- What did you think was going on ?

1938
02:04:33,737 --> 02:04:35,170
- l thought it was an S.T.O

1939
02:04:35,305 --> 02:04:36,294
- S.T.O. ?

1940
02:04:36,974 --> 02:04:38,441
- Standard Training Op

1941
02:04:42,913 --> 02:04:44,642
Congressman ! 

1942
02:04:44,715 --> 02:04:46,842
Does this mean the privacy bill is dead, Congressman ?

1943
02:04:46,917 --> 02:04:51,115
ln its current form, yes, but the issue is still very much alive, l can assure you

1944
02:04:51,355 --> 02:04:54,415
unless, of course, no one worries about national security anymore

1945
02:04:59,997 --> 02:05:03,330


1946
02:05:03,867 --> 02:05:07,530
We knew that we had to monitor our enemies

1947
02:05:07,638 --> 02:05:12,501
We've also come that we need to monitor the people who are monitoring them to realize¡­

1948
02:05:12,643 --> 02:05:16,079
Well, who's going to monitor the monitors of the monitors ?

1949
02:05:16,246 --> 02:05:19,738
l wouldn't mind doing a little, uh, monitoring myself

1950
02:05:20,017 --> 02:05:23,817
Yeah, and you got lots and lots of monitoring to do

1951
02:05:24,154 --> 02:05:25,781
Are you guys talking about sex ?

1952
02:05:27,624 --> 02:05:28,454
- Boy !

1953
02:05:28,825 --> 02:05:29,814
- Oh, no. lt's time for dinner

1954
02:05:30,027 --> 02:05:31,585
Get in there and eat your dinner

1955
02:05:31,728 --> 02:05:33,389
No more hanging with Dylan

1956
02:06:07,998 --> 02:06:10,523
Brill, you are one sick man

1957
02:06:11,835 --> 02:06:13,496


1958
02:06:14,071 --> 02:06:15,561
Yeah, me too

1959
02:06:18,275 --> 02:06:21,108
Ooh, you're gonna need to get a tan on those things

1960
02:06:26,249 --> 02:06:29,184
Congressman Albert, how do we draw the line¡­

1961
02:06:29,453 --> 02:06:32,081
between protection of national security

1962
02:06:32,222 --> 02:06:35,783
obviously the government's need to obtain intelligence data

1963
02:06:35,859 --> 02:06:37,850
and the protection of civil liberties

1964
02:06:37,928 --> 02:06:40,362
particularly the sanctity of my home ?

1965
02:06:40,430 --> 02:06:43,957
You've got no right to come into my home

1966
02:06:46,052 --> 02:06:50,386
