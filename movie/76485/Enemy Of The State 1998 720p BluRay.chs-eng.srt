把球捡回来
- Come on. Get that ball. Baah ! - [ Barking ]

这么做没问题
There's no problem with that

00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,805
真该死
Oh, goddamn it

7

lf it happens, let me know

00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:07,641
你跑来干么？这不是办公室
What the hell are you doing here ? This is not the office !

15
00:01:21,932 --> 00:01:22,921
喝咖啡吗？
- You want some coffee ?

16
00:01:23,067 --> 00:01:25,592
我不想喝，我只想陪狗玩
- No, l don't want any coffee. l want to play with my dog

17

我不要求你投赞成票
Look, l'm not asking you to vote for it

18

我知道你不能 我只请你放手
l know you can't. Just release your people

19
00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:34,537
准许其他人投赞成票
Let them go the way they want

电信安全与隐私权法案
Telecommunications Security and Privacy Act !

21
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,950
分明是侵犯隐私权
lnvasion of privacy is more like it

22
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,051
你看过华盛顿邮报吗？
You read the Post ?

23
00:01:44,788 --> 00:01:47,450
这法案并非尝试监控人民生活
"This bill is not the first step towards the surveillance society

24
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,424
根本就是侵犯人民生活
lt is the surveillance society."

我不会通过这条法案
- Listen, l'm not gonna sit in Congress and pass a law that

27
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:58,167

我不管谁跟谁上床
Look, l don't care who bangs who

31
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,733
或是哪位官员有毒瘾
what cabinet officers get stoned

32
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,602
这是世上最强盛的国家 因此而有很多人痛恨它
But this is the richest, most powerful nation on earth, and therefore the most hated

33
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,909
你很清楚一天24小时 我们都在作战
And you and l know what the average citizen does not: that we are at war 24 hours of every day

34
00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:16,849
是哦，是哦
Yeah, yeah, yeah

35

你要我逐条列出来 情治单位透过监视窃听 of American lives we've saved…
Do l have to itemize the number

36
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:23,717
光是在过去12个月 就救过多少条人命
in the past 12 months alone with judicious use of surveillance intelligence ?

37
00:02:24,595 --> 00:02:26,187
汤姆，废话少说
Thomas, cut the crap

38
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,966
在纽约州就有三家公司 in the Syracuse area alone…
l've got three major employers

39
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:32,763
会被这条法案整垮
who are gonna get just killed by this bill

40
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:37,632
不管这些公司 上次选举给你多少捐款 equal to…
l promise to get you funds

41
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,699
我保证能募得更多钱
or greater than whatever those companies gave your last campaign

42
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:43,244
我要的不是政治献金
l'm not talking about campaign contributions, damn it

43
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:46,111
我的选民会丢掉他们的饭碗
l'm talking about my constituents being out of work

44
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,111
天啊，你醒醒吧
Jesus, man ! Wake up !

45
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:51,982
国家安全不是这个国家 唯一的问题
National security isn't the only thing going on in this country

46
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:58,327
没什么好说的
This conversation is over

47
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:01,096
求求你别这样
l beg of you, Phil. Please don't

48
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:05,525
我一向都很支持你，不是吗？
l've been there for you in the past, haven't l ? There have been times

49
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:09,766
你也曾向我求助要我保密
personal situations, when you needed my assistance and my confidence

50
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,772
你在恐吓我吗，王八蛋？
Are you blackmailing me, you ambitious shit ?

51
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:17,774
很遗憾我们无法达到共识
l'm sorry we can't find a common ground on this one, Congressman

52
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:19,704
你是个好人 People of your district are lucky…
You're a good man.

53
00:03:20,517 --> 00:03:23,911
选民有你这种议员很幸运
to have you representing them

我很赞成向资方激烈抗争
Let me fight management. Okay, l can accept that

61
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:35,743
可是这次工会的领导人 goddamned union leadership…
But this is our own

that the mob has been controlling these guys since as long as l can remember

现在潘提洛又派人殴打员工 now we got Pintero's goons…
And now, uh-- down there tuning up my people

66
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:53,519
这已经形成伤害和恐吓罪名
Well, first off, that's a Hobbs Act violation, probably a RlCO

67
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:56,325

A Hobbs and a RlCO. Ooh, baby, don't stop

71
00:07:03,805 --> 00:07:05,670
听起来你们需要劳工律师
Sounds like you guys need a labor lawyer. 

72
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:07,302
怎么回事？
What happened ?

73
00:07:08,677 --> 00:07:12,841
两天前我在餐馆吃饭 上厕所时被臭义佬偷袭
We were in Louie's two nights ago,l go to use the bathroom, and these two fuckin' guidos jump me

74
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,780
我们最好用意裔美国人
Uh, l prefer we use the term "ltalian-Americans."

75
00:07:17,252 --> 00:07:21,052
随便，他们开始揍我
Eh, whatever, but they were really goin' to work on me. lt could've gotten serious

- But then Larry Cash came in and he went after 'em

- Larry Cash is in the hospital,with a broken jaw and a ruptured kidney

鳟鱼好吃吗？
So, how's the trout ?

91
00:08:07,903 --> 00:08:08,961
味道很像是鱼
- Tastes like fish

92
00:08:09,404 --> 00:08:10,393
本来就是鱼
- lt is fish

93
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:13,639
我是说跟别的鱼没两样
No, l mean it tastes like every other fish l've ever had

94
00:08:14,242 --> 00:08:15,300
好吧
Okay

95
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:22,946
这卷带子会让潘提洛低头 Brill's note said that…
[ Clears Throat ] this is the videotape you need to convince Pintero with

96
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:24,683
你要小心联邦调查局
And watch out for the F.B.l. 

97
00:08:24,753 --> 00:08:27,051
毕瑞说那地方受到监视
Brill says the place is under surveillance

98
00:08:27,422 --> 00:08:28,582
我几时能见他？
- So when do l get to meet him ?

永远都不能
Never

00:08:36,898 --> 00:08:37,887
好吧
Okay. Um--

103
00:08:39,134 --> 00:08:41,830
这不是我想要的答案
Wow. That's not exactly the answer l was hoping for

104
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,063
你想要的是什么答案？
And what was the answer you were hoping for ?

105
00:08:44,439 --> 00:08:46,100
不知道，很快吧
Oh, l don't know. Soon

106
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:47,768
总比“永远都不能”好一些
Uh, definitely sooner than never

107
00:08:47,876 --> 00:08:50,936
不要每次都跟我吵
Bobby, why do we have to go through this every time ?

108
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:53,237
毕瑞告诉我，我告诉你
Brill talks to me, l talk to you

109
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:54,980
这是游戏规则
That's the way it works

110
00:08:55,283 --> 00:09:00,781
原谅我不喜欢请一个 我不认识也没见过面的人做事 a little uncomfortable…
Well, pardon me for being with hiring someone that l don't know and l've never even met

111
00:09:00,222 --> 00:09:01,655
那就别请他
Then don't hire him

112
00:09:07,295 --> 00:09:08,785
一万元
$10,000

113
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:12,061
我也不喜欢带这么一大笔现金
And l'm also uncomfortable havin' to carry that kind of cash around

114
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:14,563
现在你应该放心吧
Well, this should lighten your load

115
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,805
是你还是毕瑞要求加薪？
l don't know if it's Brill's price that's goin' up or your commission

116
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,870
我一向都拿一成五佣金
l take 15%, as always

117
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:23,000
毕瑞以工作性质开价
Brill's fee varies with risk

118
00:09:23,211 --> 00:09:25,372
也许你宁愿找别人
Maybe you'd be more comfortable using someone else

119
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:27,208
不找毕瑞？
- What, other than Brill ?

120
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:28,809
不找我
- Other than me

121
00:09:30,085 --> 00:09:31,017
你有什么不好？
- What's wrong with you ?

122
00:09:31,086 --> 00:09:32,576
没什么
- Oh, there's nothing wrong with me

123
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:38,526
也许你想找没跟你交往过的人 someone with whom…
Just, you know, you don't have quite so complicated a history

124
00:09:41,296 --> 00:09:43,924
我不介意，我喜欢你
l like our history, and l like you

125
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,726
我也喜欢你
Tsk. l like you too

Look, l-l just want to make sure that l'm not breaking the law in any way

127
00:09:53,508 --> 00:09:54,372
你没犯法
- You're not

128
00:09:55,444 --> 00:09:56,877
我怎么能确定？
- And how can l be so sure ?

129
00:09:58,447 --> 00:10:01,249
因为我不会让你犯法

他是死于心脏病发作

这个蠢蛋是谁？
- l mean, who is this idiot ?

00:29:44,996 --> 00:29:47,829
他想侵犯个人隐私权

447

着急什么？

Before we had a chance to talk about it, he ran out of the store

474
00:30:53,498 --> 00:30:56,126
他突然冲出去，结果就被撞死

很好笑
- Hah ! Very funny !

l suppose he could've given it directly to Bob Woodward

530
00:33:42,233 --> 00:33:45,964
狄恩从银行提过 四、五K七次巨款
has four, five, seven cash withdrawals of 4,000, 5,000

531
00:33:46,904 --> 00:33:49,270
金额越来越高
and up, and up

532
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,407
一到两天之内
and each time

533
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:54,944
班小姐就存入一笔现金
the delectable Miss Banks makes large cash deposits of her own within a day or two

534
00:33:55,012 --> 00:33:55,808
她在勒索他
- Blackmail ? - Well, her deposits aren't the same

535
00:33:55,913 --> 00:33:59,981
她存的金额不同，我算算看
but let me figure this out

536
00:34:00,218 --> 00:34:04,921
刚好是狄恩提款的一成五
- [ Beeping ] - Oh, yes, they're exactly-- exactly 15% of the amount Dean withdrew

537
00:34:05,456 --> 00:34:07,651
布莱恩，咖啡
Brian, can we get some more ? [ Whistles ]

538
00:34:08,726 --> 00:34:13,060
有高空摄影机、警用摄影机
l mean, you know, we got the blimp cam, we got the police officer cam

539
00:34:12,163 --> 00:34:16,827
两架自动提款机监看机 这一个最有用
we've got two A.T.M. cameras, but this is the one showing promise

540
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,492
内衣店的监看机，停格
This is the security camera at the underwear store. Freeze there

541
00:34:20,938 --> 00:34:24,101
做75度的原地旋转
- [ Computer Beeps ] - Rotate us 75 degrees around the vertical, please

542
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:25,633
停格
Freeze there

543
00:34:26,377 --> 00:34:27,344
放大十倍
Times ten

544
00:34:29,847 --> 00:34:30,939
他丢了什么进去
Focus on the drop

545
00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:36,844
放大，一格一格前进
Enhance, then forward frame-by-frame

546
00:34:40,524 --> 00:34:42,492
好，就在K
All right. Now, 

547
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,255
狄恩的袋子的形状有改变
just before the view's blocked, there's a shape change in Dean's bag

548
00:34:44,328 --> 00:34:46,353
阴影有变化
See the shadow variance ? See ?

549
00:34:46,464 --> 00:34:50,230
齐丹尼改变狄恩的袋子形状
The shadow's wrong. Zavitz changed the configuration of Dean's packages

550
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:52,133
是录影带吗？
- ls it a tape ?

551
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,861
很难说
- lt's hard to say for sure. These things are--

552
00:34:54,972 --> 00:34:56,166
能不能转到另一边？
- Can the computer take us around to the other side ?

553
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,735
电脑只能作假设
- lt can hypothesize. Chris ?

554
00:34:59,076 --> 00:35:02,671
请你做75度的旋转 - Can you rotate us…
- Yeah ? 75 degrees around the vertical, please ?

555
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:07,750
你觉得是什么？
- What do you think it is ?

556
00:35:08,252 --> 00:35:09,742
看起来比录影带大
- lt looks a lot bigger than a tape

557
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,754
齐丹尼家里有数位压缩器材
Zavitz had digital compression equipment in his apartment

558
00:35:11,822 --> 00:35:13,756
他可以下载到任何东西上
He could've downloaded it to anything

559
00:35:13,924 --> 00:35:15,824
也许狄恩只是用手捏紧袋子
Or maybe the bag twisted in Dean's hand

560
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,658
或是别的东西改变阴影
Or something moved in front of the light and altered the shadow. 

561
00:35:18,729 --> 00:35:19,661
也许根本不重要
Maybe it's nothing

562
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:20,822
也许很重要
Maybe it's everything

563
00:35:21,432 --> 00:35:22,729
一定要拿到手
Let's get it and find out

564
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,637
滚开，我在忙
- Beat it. l got work to do. - [ Barking ]

565
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,531
快滚
Go. Porsche !

566
00:35:29,373 --> 00:35:30,533
小宝


567
00:35:34,845 --> 00:35:35,903
滚开
- Go away !

568
00:35:36,747 --> 00:35:39,409
可恶的小狗
- [ Porsche Barking ] - Damn it, Porsche !

569
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:43,042
狄先生吗？ 我是，能帮什么忙？
- Hello, Mr. Dean ? - Uh, yes. Can l help you ?

570
00:35:43,921 --> 00:35:45,855
我们是华府警探，比翰跟普洛
This is Detective Benning. l'm Pratt. We're with D.C. Metro

571
00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:51,091
打搅了，我们想问齐丹尼的事
- Shh. - Uh, sorry to bother you at home, sir. We were hoping to ask you a few questions about Daniel Zavitz

572
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:52,887
请出示你们的警徽
- Wh-- l'm s-- Can l see your badges, please ?

573
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:53,962
没问题
- Certainly, sir

574
00:35:54,031 --> 00:35:56,363

Sure

575
00:35:58,269 --> 00:36:00,169
请进，小宝，别乱叫
All right. Come on. Back up, Porsche

576
00:36:04,408 --> 00:36:06,342
装得有礼貌
- All right. Nice and smooth. Come on. - Okay

577
00:36:06,744 --> 00:36:09,269
我没看到车祸，不知道谁错
l didn't really see the accident. l don't know whose fault it was

578
00:36:09,346 --> 00:36:11,109
这跟车祸无关
-We're not here to talk about the accident, Mr. Dean

579
00:36:11,582 --> 00:36:13,140
不过你们说K
-l'm sorry, l thought you said--

580
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,081
抱歉让你误解了
[ Pratt ] We should apologize for the confusion, sir

581
00:36:15,186 --> 00:36:17,848
这是另外一件事
lt's just that we're handling a different aspect of the inquiry

582
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:21,286
齐先生涉及一起恐吓案
lt turns out Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme

583
00:36:21,592 --> 00:36:22,581
手表是什么牌子？
- What kind of watch is that ?

584
00:36:24,195 --> 00:36:25,219
欧米茄
- lt's an Omega

585
00:36:25,429 --> 00:36:27,420
他不是你的委托人吧
- So you're not constrained by attorney-client privilege ? - [ Barking ]

586
00:36:28,766 --> 00:36:29,698
不是
- Shh-shh. Yeah, that's correct

587
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:31,860
是这样子，我们相信
- You see, Mr. Dean, we have reason to believe

588
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:34,437
齐先生把敏感的资料交给你
that Mr. Zavitz may have passed sensitive materials to you

589
00:36:34,572 --> 00:36:37,105
什么资料？
- [ Growls ] - What kind of materials ?

590
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:39,699
敏感资料，希望你能告诉我们
[ Pratt, Over Speaker ] Well, sensitive, so we were hoping you could tell us that

591
00:36:39,977 --> 00:36:43,140
他没给我什么
[ Dean Sighs ] No, he didn't pass me anything

592
00:36:43,214 --> 00:36:45,774
声音显示高度焦虑感
These voice stress points indicate a really high degree of anxiety

593
00:36:46,851 --> 00:36:48,341
为什么焦虑？
Anxiety about what ?

594
00:36:48,819 --> 00:36:50,218
这是物理定律
That's the nature of physics

595
00:36:50,287 --> 00:36:53,120
他给我东西我一定会知道
lf he'd given me something, l would've known

596
00:36:53,457 --> 00:36:54,685
他在说谎
- Oh, he's lying !

597
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:56,453
你的购物袋呢？
- What about your packages, sir ?

598
00:36:56,627 --> 00:37:00,028
也许他放什么进去你不知道
Could something have slipped in amongst the purchases without your knowledge ?

599
00:36:59,363 --> 00:37:02,821
他没有给我什么K
Excuse me. Daniel Zavitz did not give me anything

600
00:37:03,234 --> 00:37:04,064
派克牌钢笔
- That's a Parker pen

601
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:05,995
是万宝龙
- lt's a Mont Blanc

602
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:09,196
K也没跟我发生关系
He didn't secrete it into any of my bodily orifices

603
00:37:09,406 --> 00:37:10,805
不管是什么，我没有你们要的
- Whatever it is, l don't have it

604
00:37:10,908 --> 00:37:11,897
我们能看看吗？
- Could we look at them ?

605
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,077
没有搜索票就不行
l don't think so. Not without a warrant

606
00:37:14,411 --> 00:37:15,343
老天
- Oh, Christ

607
00:37:16,013 --> 00:37:16,843
他很高竿
- This guy's good

608
00:37:16,947 --> 00:37:18,505
你去那家店干嘛？
- How did you happen to be at Ruby's today ? - l was shopping for lingerie

609
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:22,517
我去买内衣，这犯法吗？ 买给你太太吗？
- That's still legal, isn't it ? - You buying that for your wife ?

610
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:24,985
不是，买给我自己
No, l was, uh, picking something up for myself

611
00:37:25,055 --> 00:37:28,183
周末我最爱扮成女生 You know, you'd be surprised…
l do a little cross-dressing on the weekends.

612
00:37:28,259 --> 00:37:31,228
穿那种糖果内衣感觉好性感
how a nice pair of edible panties can make a guy feel sexy

613
00:37:31,562 --> 00:37:32,961
不是送给蕾秋班克吗？
We thought it might be for Rachel Banks

614
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:36,397
晚安，两位
Good night, gentlemen

615
00:37:37,935 --> 00:37:41,167
晚安 晚安，狄先生
- Good night, sir. - Good night, Mr. Dean

616
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,850
他们在说什么？什么也没有
What are they talking about, Porsche ? There's nothing here

617
00:38:09,066 --> 00:38:11,227
老公，我回来了
Honey, l'm home

618
00:38:11,335 --> 00:38:14,771
等一下，亲爱的
- [ Door Shuts ] - Uh, yeah, just a second, sweetie

619
00:38:17,424 --> 00:38:23,680
（国安局，9时22分）


620
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,410
他不是准备公开，就是不知情
Well, either he's getting ready to do something with it, or he doesn't know he has it

621
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,142
或是真的没有
Or he doesn't have it

622
00:38:29,886 --> 00:38:31,080
你们知道吗？
You know what l've seen ?

623
00:38:32,289 --> 00:38:34,348
我看过凶手被无罪开释 l've seen killers walk free…


624
00:38:34,424 --> 00:38:37,291
就因为证人是酒鬼
because the eyewitness was an alcoholic

625
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,523
我看过有人强暴妓女被判无罪
l've seen sex offenders that couldn't be touched because the victim was a call girl

626
00:38:40,597 --> 00:38:41,757
信誉
Credibility-- 

627
00:38:41,898 --> 00:38:45,390
碰到这种情况只能用这手段
lt's the only currency that means anything on this kind of playing field

628
00:38:46,636 --> 00:38:48,297
要是狄恩敢公开录影带
Dean's got the tape, and he's gonna come out with it

629
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:51,169
我就毁了他的名誉
And when he does, l want his credibility

630
00:38:51,308 --> 00:38:53,606
让大家认为他在说谎
l want people to know he's lying before they hear what he says

631
00:38:53,743 --> 00:38:55,938
干脆拿他妻儿威胁他
We could take his wife and kid. He'd give it up for them

632
00:38:56,112 --> 00:38:59,741
这样警方和FBI就会插手
We'd have the police and the F.B.l. all over this in 24 hours

633
00:38:59,816 --> 00:39:03,081
监视他的一举一动
Put taps on his 20 most frequently called numbers, and let's get into his life

634
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,150
那起劳资纠纷肯定跟黑道有关
The union situation has-has mob written all over it

635
00:39:06,256 --> 00:39:08,417
他跟蕾秋的关系也很暖昧
And he's definitely vulnerable on Rachel Banks

636
00:39:08,491 --> 00:39:10,982
调查他的老婆、父母
l want to know about his wife, l want to know about his parents

637
00:39:11,094 --> 00:39:13,756
赌债、尿液样本、租过的A片
l want to know about his gambling problems, his urine samples, his porno rentals

638
00:39:13,997 --> 00:39:16,158
我要不择手段达到目的
l want to use every means possible to get what we need

639
00:39:16,766 --> 00:39:19,758
我不会让这浑蛋毁了我一生
Because this little son of a bitch is not going to be the final chapter of my life

640
00:39:25,842 --> 00:39:27,173
告诉我
- [ Carla ] Tell me something. - [ Dean ] Uh-oh

641
00:39:28,311 --> 00:39:31,303
你怎么查到潘提洛和工会挂勾
How did you find out Pintero was associated with union officials ?

642
00:39:32,015 --> 00:39:33,039
我很高竿
l'm just that good

643
00:39:34,084 --> 00:39:36,678
我请了一名侦探
l hired an investigator

644
00:39:46,663 --> 00:39:49,826
让小狗闭嘴
- Hey. - Shut up the dog !

645
00:39:50,033 --> 00:39:51,330
我老妈也有一只
My mom used to have one of these. Come on

646
00:39:51,901 --> 00:39:53,869
它咬我
Ow ! The dog bit me !

647
00:39:54,571 --> 00:39:56,061
那个侦探是谁？
- Who was the investigator ?

648
00:39:56,473 --> 00:39:58,031
你要知道他名字？
- Wh-What do you mean ? His name ?

649
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:02,011
是不是蕾秋认识的那个？
Come on, Bobby. You know what l'm asking. ls it the guy who Rachel knows ?

650
00:40:04,447 --> 00:40:06,415
你每次都要为这件事吵吗？
Why do-- Why do we have to go through this every time ?

651
00:40:06,516 --> 00:40:08,507
我只是问问
- Baby, l'm just asking, okay ? - Carla

652
00:40:08,852 --> 00:40:11,286
蕾秋班克已不再是问题
Rachel Banks is not an issue anymore

653
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:29,204
我生命中的女人只有你K
You are the only woman in the world for me

654
00:40:31,908 --> 00:40:33,170
K你和珍娜杰克森
You and Janet Jackson

655
00:40:33,276 --> 00:40:38,145
要是珍娜杰克森看上我
- [ Scoffs ] - l have to be honest. lf-lf Janet Jackson called me

656
00:40:38,281 --> 00:40:41,182
我就有机会当麦可的妹夫
l w-- l might have to change my last name to Jackson

657
00:40:41,284 --> 00:40:42,683
才怪
- Yeah, right. 

658
00:40:43,019 --> 00:40:45,351
我会打断她的狗腿
l'd have to break that woman's legs too

659
00:40:53,763 --> 00:40:55,162
装成青少年涂鸦

至少给我留了一套西装

你怎么知道不是潘提洛？

只是没重大损失
lt was just kind of frivolous

我小时候也做过坏事

不是闯空门，是别的事
l mean, not breaking-and-entering, but, you know, stuff

705
00:43:41,631 --> 00:43:44,998

Yeah, we all did stuff. l just wish they hadn't stolen my damn blender

706

你好像很喜欢果汁机
You seem a little attached to this blender, Robert

Yeah, then on top of it, the only suit they leave me is three years old

710
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:03,082
早就不流行了
Hasn't gotten any better with age

Jerry, l-l'm suing their right-wing asses right into Chapter 11 !

713
00:44:12,962 --> 00:44:16,261

This is flagrant ! They never even called to see what my side of the story was !

714
00:44:16,332 --> 00:44:18,425
我大可以上法院告他们
- [ Knock At Door ] - They have no Sullivan protection with this !

00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:19,831

736
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:15,320
为什么？
And why is that ?

737
00:45:16,259 --> 00:45:19,660
你替黑道老大成立空壳公司

也不认识黑道老大

或是跟黑道家族有任何关系
Or having any relationship whatsoever to the Peitso family !

746
00:45:42,185 --> 00:45:43,413
太荒谬了

747
00:45:44,187 --> 00:45:45,381
马克，让我告诉你

四年前你和她有婚外情
Did you have an affair with her four years ago ?

757

你有没有打过手枪？
You ever beat off in the shower, Brian ?

758
00:46:14,617 --> 00:46:17,711
或是搞过同性

759
00:46:17,887 --> 00:46:18,876
这跟你K
- Bobby, that is--

760
00:46:18,988 --> 00:46:20,922
一点关系都没有
- None of my fucking business ! !

761
00:46:21,024 --> 00:46:22,150
这不是重要
You're damn right it's not 

762
00:46:23,093 --> 00:46:25,084
我爱我的妻儿

763
00:46:25,195 --> 00:46:27,527
我对他们的爱是绝对的
absolutely, with no equivocations, 

764
00:46:27,597 --> 00:46:29,360
这也与你无关
and that's none of your fuckin' business either

765
00:46:30,266 --> 00:46:32,564
你最好先留职停薪 should take a leave of absence…
Uh, we think that you

766
00:46:32,669 --> 00:46:34,660
澄清这些疑点
until we're able to, uh, sort all this out

767
00:46:34,971 --> 00:46:35,903
你们要炒我鱿鱼？
- Are you firing me ?

768
00:46:36,106 --> 00:46:37,630
你刚炒了自己的鱿鱼
- l think you just fired yourself

769
00:46:48,618 --> 00:46:50,552
卡拉
Carla !

Don't go in there. She doesn't want to talk to you

772
00:47:00,063 --> 00:47:00,859
为什么？
- Why not ?

773
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:02,397
她正在看报纸
- Because she's reading the paper

774
00:47:06,436 --> 00:47:08,404
混蛋
Asshole

00:47:08,538 --> 00:47:09,527
卡拉
Carla--

776
00:47:11,975 --> 00:47:13,567
我得看报才知道？
How could you let me find out like this ?

777
00:47:13,643 --> 00:47:15,235
我也才刚知道
l'm findin' out like this. This is all lies. 

778
00:47:15,311 --> 00:47:17,836
这全是谎
None of this stuff is true

779
00:47:18,047 --> 00:47:19,878
你是说你没跟她碰面
So you're saying you weren't there with her ?

780
00:47:20,049 --> 00:47:22,415
我们每个月吃一次饭
Yes, l had lunch with her. We have lunch once a month

781
00:47:22,485 --> 00:47:24,453
她帮我介绍那个侦探毕瑞
She's the contact for the investigator, Brill

782
00:47:24,521 --> 00:47:25,579
你猜得没错
 You were right about that

783
00:47:25,822 --> 00:47:29,189
这一定是餐馆监看器拍的照片
Someone must have taken this picture off the security camera outside the restaurant

784
00:47:29,292 --> 00:47:30,589
你说她已不是问题
- You said she wasn't an issue. - She's not !

785
00:47:30,693 --> 00:47:33,321
当然不是，我们只是谈公事
l have to see her for business

786
00:47:33,429 --> 00:47:35,158
要是我告诉你
And l knew if l told you that--

787
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:36,892
你跟她有过婚外情
Bobby, you had an affair with this woman ! An affair

788
00:47:37,066 --> 00:47:39,967
我们看了一年的婚姻辅导
We went to a counselor for a year !

789
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:43,338
现在你连跟她见面都不承认
And now you're standin' there lyin' about even seein' her ?

790
00:47:43,606 --> 00:47:44,937
你让我作呕
You make me sick !

791
00:47:46,476 --> 00:47:52,415
报上说我洗黑钱、跟黑道挂勾
Carla, l am smeared all over the newspapers for money- laundering schemes, mob ties--

792
00:47:52,816 --> 00:47:53,942
我还丢掉工作
l lost my job

793
00:47:54,617 --> 00:47:55,549
求求你
l am asking you

794
00:47:55,885 --> 00:47:59,946
蕾秋这件事请你要相信我
l am asking you to please just trust me on this Rachel Banks thing right now

795
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:02,852
我凭什么相信你？
How in God's name can l trust you ?

796
00:48:03,827 --> 00:48:05,055
我要你离开
Bobby, l want you to leave

797
00:48:05,161 --> 00:48:07,152
这不是真的
Carla, l'm telling you that this is all bullshit !

798
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:09,061
我不想再听下去
l don't want to hear anything else

799
00:48:09,132 --> 00:48:12,124
我得单独想想，给我走吧
l cannot think with you in my face. l want you to leave

800
00:48:12,235 --> 00:48:14,567
你要想什么？
What do you need to think about ? l'm telling you it's bullshit !

801
00:48:14,637 --> 00:48:17,401
让我冷静一下
Just leave, so l can think ! For me, okay ? Just leave

802
00:48:17,473 --> 00:48:19,566
你走吧，快走吧

All right, we're moving into phase two of the training op

829

塞斯会做简报，仔细听好
Selby's gonna brief you on it, so listen up, okay ?

830
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:57,498
我们要守在广场上
We're gonna be following the subjects through the square

831

三个人监听、两个人录影 video surveillance units…
We're gonna have three listening stations and two with unidirectional mikes

832
00:50:01,878 --> 00:50:03,072
普洛是三号
Pratt, you're three. Jones, Fiedler, Krug

833
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:07,414
琼斯、斐德和古格跟着目标
you guys are at ground level. You'll be following the targets

834
00:50:07,483 --> 00:50:09,610
听我的命令行动
You move when l say, you go when l say

835
00:50:09,953 --> 00:50:11,386
我决定谁来跟监
All handoffs go on my command

836
00:50:12,255 --> 00:50:13,483
菜鸟听好了
Now, for the uninitiated, if we don't have line-of-sight

837
00:50:13,856 --> 00:50:17,888
看不到目标就无法进行窃听
we can't hear what they say, right ?

838
00:50:18,227 --> 00:50:18,921
懂不懂？
- Right ?

839
00:50:19,095 --> 00:50:20,062
我懂了
- Yeah. Got it

- All right. You guys clear ?

喂？
- Yeah

842
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,600
你们是通讯官吗？
Jones, Krug, what, are you guys from communications ?

特种部队
- No, we're ops

844
00:50:27,303 --> 00:50:28,668
看发型就知道
- You can tell by their haircuts

845
00:50:30,922 --> 00:50:37,012
（潘氏礼车公司，10时06分）


846
00:50:37,012 --> 00:50:40,140
我想见潘先生 with Mr. Pintero in private…
l would like to sit down

847
00:50:40,215 --> 00:50:42,183
谈谈我最近的遭遇
so he and l can discuss what's happening to me

848
00:50:42,251 --> 00:50:43,548
他们说他会在
l called; they said he was here

849
00:50:44,419 --> 00:50:46,410
潘先生可以帮你
Mr. Pintero would like to help you

850
00:50:47,756 --> 00:50:50,490
不过他不会帮
[ Chuckles ] But he won't

851
00:50:50,893 --> 00:50:52,121
为什么？ - Well, first, you haven't told him…
- And why not ?

852
00:50:52,294 --> 00:50:56,061
因为你没说出录影带是谁拍的
who made the tape, and second

853
00:50:56,164 --> 00:51:00,191
而且我们花了几十万元 of thousands of dollars…
we've spent hundreds

854
00:51:00,269 --> 00:51:02,499
请来像你这种奸诈律师 just like you…
on shyster lawyers

855
00:51:02,838 --> 00:51:07,104
就为了对付你这种奸诈律师
because of shyster lawyers just like you

856
00:51:08,176 --> 00:51:11,009
“奸诈律师”这个字眼 is generally reserved…
Actually, l believe the slur "shyster"

857
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:14,071
通常都是形容犹太裔律师
for Jewish attorneys

858
00:51:14,182 --> 00:51:17,982
骂我这种人的字眼应该是K for someone like myself…
l believe the proper slur

859
00:51:18,053 --> 00:51:19,452
K黑鬼
would be, uh, "eggplant."

860

Boom. This kid gets brighter every time l see him

我知道，圣诞节大塞车
l know. Uh, Christmas traffic is horrible

864
00:51:34,369 --> 00:51:38,465
我们不该在公共场所碰面
You know, it's not so smart, us being seen together in public like this

865
00:51:39,907 --> 00:51:41,067
有什么好怕的？
- Do we have anything to hide ?

866
00:51:41,209 --> 00:51:43,040
有杂音，二号比较好吗？
- Heavy background on one. Can we do better on two ?

867
00:51:43,478 --> 00:51:44,502
应该没有
- [ Rachel ] Unfortunately not

868
00:51:44,712 --> 00:51:45,371
二号比较好
- Two is better

869

国税局通知我
[ Rachel ] The l.R.S. contacted me this morning

870

二号别动 - They say my lifestyle…
- Two, you're good. Hold position.

871
00:51:49,984 --> 00:51:55,121
他们说我的花费比收入多 你被查税？
- exceeds my income. - Ohh. You're being audited ?

872
00:51:55,256 --> 00:51:56,746
这四年来的税
For the last four years

873
00:51:57,225 --> 00:51:58,817
这是怎么回事？
What's going on, Bobby ?

874
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,084
别担心
Uh, look, don't worry about that

875
00:52:01,162 --> 00:52:03,357
我会免费替你打官司

- You don't work there anymore, remember ?

878
00:52:07,168 --> 00:52:09,261
只是暂时的
lt's a temporary situation

879
00:52:09,337 --> 00:52:11,362
听不到，转到三号
- Your 80's becoming a 20. Move to audio three

880
00:52:11,439 --> 00:52:12,838
这是三号，好多了
- On three. Much better

881
00:52:13,174 --> 00:52:14,163
我们完了
- [ Rachel ] We're screwed

882
00:52:14,442 --> 00:52:15,340
一号快醒来
- Wake up, one

883
00:52:15,777 --> 00:52:16,766
我们一败涂地
[ Rachel ] We are out

我会解决的
l'm going to fix this

怎么解决？
- How ?

887
00:52:23,451 --> 00:52:24,383
告诉我毕瑞的事
- Tell me about Brill

888
00:52:24,685 --> 00:52:27,017
他说比尔吗？ 不，是毕瑞
- Did he say "Bill" ? - No, "Brill," with an "R."

889
00:52:27,455 --> 00:52:28,387
不行
- l can't do that

890
00:52:28,589 --> 00:52:31,285
查毕瑞这个名字 好
- Cross-reference Rachel's file. See if "Brill" comes up. - Got it

891
00:52:31,626 --> 00:52:35,084
他是这件事的关键人物
Rachel, don't you see that he is the key to this whole mess ?

892
00:52:35,863 --> 00:52:38,798
你把录影带给我就出了事
From the second you gave me that tape, my life has been falling apart

893
00:52:38,966 --> 00:52:41,093
你说他没有问题
You assured me that this-this guy was legit

894
00:52:41,202 --> 00:52:43,534
二号别动
- You needed information; l got it for you. - Two, you're good

三号很清楚
- Three is good

我不想再谈了
- This conversation is over

897
00:52:48,843 --> 00:52:52,006
走吧
- Okay, here we go

898

你想怎么办？
- [ Dean Continues, lndistinct ]

899
00:52:53,548 --> 00:52:54,640
二号加强
- Two, you gotta do better

900
00:52:54,782 --> 00:52:56,784
你想过以前的生活吗？
- Shit. - You want your life back ?

901
00:52:57,385 --> 00:52:59,046
我没有生活可
l don't have a life

902
00:53:00,288 --> 00:53:02,222
我爱上有妇之夫
l'm in love with a married man

903
00:53:08,496 --> 00:53:10,123
他坐在长椅上
Okay, l have 'em on the bench

904
00:53:10,231 --> 00:53:13,790
蕾秋，对不起
Rachel, l'm sorry, 

905
00:53:14,702 --> 00:53:16,033
这我恐怕无能为力
but there's nothing l can do about that

906
00:53:16,771 --> 00:53:18,261
你怎么知道是你？
What makes you think it's you ?

907
00:53:21,509 --> 00:53:22,498
不是我？
lt's not me ?

908
00:53:24,879 --> 00:53:26,870
我只是以为K
l j-- l just as-assumed from--

909
00:53:26,981 --> 00:53:28,278
你是个呆瓜
- You're a moron, you know that ?

910
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:31,550
是啊，我知道
- Yes. l know

911
00:53:36,057 --> 00:53:38,321
你得跟我谈谈毕瑞
Rachel, you're gonna have to tell me about Brill

912
00:53:41,429 --> 00:53:42,361
我们走吧
Let's get out of here

913
00:53:43,531 --> 00:53:44,520
他们走了
All right. They're on the move

914
00:53:46,234 --> 00:53:46,962
换到三号
- Comin' to three

915
00:53:47,101 --> 00:53:47,760
跟着他们
- Stay with 'em

916
00:53:48,202 --> 00:53:50,261
有四成K二成讯号
- l got 40, 20--

917
00:53:50,404 --> 00:53:54,363
中间有很多树，二号跟上去
-[ Garbled Audio ] -You're following through trees. Two, can you track them ?

918
00:53:54,475 --> 00:53:57,103
我看不到他们
l have lost line-of-sight. Repeat, l have lost line-of-sight

919
00:53:57,311 --> 00:53:58,300
你没有讯号
- Three, you've got nothing. - l've lost line-of-sight. 

920
00:53:58,412 --> 00:53:59,709
我看不到了
l'm out

921
00:53:59,881 --> 00:54:02,577
失去声音，用追踪器跟踪他
We've lost audio; it's gone. But we still have his tracers. We can still follow 'em

922
00:54:03,217 --> 00:54:05,151
我想跟他联络
When l need to reach Brill

923
00:54:05,686 --> 00:54:08,348
就用粉笔在邮筒做记号
l chalk the mailbox outside my house

924
00:54:09,156 --> 00:54:11,750
他有回应我就去找他
When he crosses the mark, l make the drop

925
00:54:11,993 --> 00:54:15,929
地点和时间每次都相同
The location's always the same-- same time, same place

926
00:54:16,297 --> 00:54:18,527
三点钟到吉柏逊岛的渡轮
3:00 p.m. ferry to Gibson lsland

927
00:54:19,634 --> 00:54:20,896
你见过他吗？
- [ Dean ] You ever see him in person ?

928
00:54:20,968 --> 00:54:22,435
他做事很小心
- He's the cautious type. 

929
00:54:22,503 --> 00:54:24,562
不会喜欢你去找他
He's not gonna like you trackin' him down

1017
01:01:32,934 --> 01:01:35,129
不准联络，你坏了规矩
No contact. You broke the rules

1018
01:01:35,236 --> 01:01:38,103
他们一定是去屋顶 直升机飞到饭店的屋顶

收到不同的讯号

1033
01:02:10,338 --> 01:02:12,499
3号下降，4、5号没动
- Tracer three is on its way down

1034
01:02:12,573 --> 01:02:13,699
他跑到哪儿？
Where did he go ?

1035
01:02:14,008 --> 01:02:15,498
谁叫你到渡轮找我？

他说他是毕瑞
- He said he was Brill

1040
01:02:22,817 --> 01:02:24,978
是不是你先说的？
Did he say it or did you, and he picked up on it ? 

1041
01:02:25,286 --> 01:02:26,446
仔细想
Come on. Think

1042
01:02:26,754 --> 01:02:27,584
糟糕，是我说的

1054
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:54,072
你很皮，是吧？
You're kind of a jerk, aren't you ?

1055
01:02:54,849 --> 01:02:57,477
国安局能透过卫星看你的表
- The N.S.A. can read the time off your fucking wristwatch

1056
01:02:57,752 --> 01:02:59,447

They're the only ones in the country who could possibly have anything like this

1063
01:03:16,671 --> 01:03:17,797

01:13:13,133 --> 01:13:17,665
那就冒点险 让狄先生尝尝苦头
Make things a bit more serious for Mr. Dean. We'll both think about how, okay ?

1202
01:13:17,971 --> 01:13:19,632
好吧
Okay. Good

1203
01:13:25,378 --> 01:13:26,208
有问题吗？
- Anything wrong ?

1204
01:13:26,813 --> 01:13:27,802
没有
- No

1205
01:13:30,984 --> 01:13:34,977
两、三年前你就该当上副局长
You should have made deputy director two years ago, maybe three

1206
01:13:35,388 --> 01:13:38,516
只要法案通过你就能出头
But it'll happen now. Once this bill passes, that'll be it for you

1207
01:13:41,143 --> 01:13:47,933
（狄恩宅，7时15分）


1208
01:13:47,933 --> 01:13:49,264
谢了，玛莉亚
Thanks, Marie

1209
01:13:57,309 --> 01:14:00,403
你在叫什么？
Porsche, what are you barking at, boy ?

1210
01:14:12,992 --> 01:14:14,016
小宝
Porsche ?

1211
01:14:15,961 --> 01:14:16,620
是我
- lt's me

1212
01:14:16,695 --> 01:14:18,993
你差点把我吓死
- l know it's you. You scared the shit out of me

1213
01:14:19,098 --> 01:14:23,057
房子被窃听，他们在监视
The house is bugged. Everything you say, they can hear and maybe see

1214
01:14:23,402 --> 01:14:25,302
听我说
Listen to me. Listen, listen

1215
01:14:25,871 --> 01:14:27,395
我对天发誓
l never-- l swear to God. l never-- This is the truth

1216
01:14:27,506 --> 01:14:32,171
自上次我就没再跟蕾秋有私情
l never, ever since the problem, touched Rachel like that

1217
01:14:32,411 --> 01:14:36,279
我不爱她，我爱的是你
l never even looked at her like that, honey. l love you

1218
01:14:36,515 --> 01:14:39,507
这世上我只爱你一个
l love you, and that is it. That is it. Only you

1219
01:14:40,519 --> 01:14:41,816
儿子呢？
What about Eric ?

1220
01:14:42,054 --> 01:14:43,487
我也爱他
And Eric

1221
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:45,982
我也爱你家人
And l love your family

1222
01:14:46,926 --> 01:14:47,824
你老爸除外
Except for your dad

1223
01:14:50,496 --> 01:14:53,693
我需要你，我真的需要你
l need you. l need you real bad. l need you, okay ?

1224
01:14:56,969 --> 01:14:57,993
好吧
Okay

1225
01:15:00,973 --> 01:15:02,133
我就说吧
l told you, Bobby

1226
01:15:03,242 --> 01:15:05,301
政府无所不用其极
l told you they had this type of capability

1227
01:15:05,377 --> 01:15:08,869
那条法案会给他们更多权力
And that goddamn privacy bill is just another way for them to expand the power

1228
01:15:09,014 --> 01:15:09,673
嘘
- Shh

1229
01:15:09,782 --> 01:15:10,908
别嘘我
- Don't you "shh" me

1230
01:15:14,587 --> 01:15:16,384
你说得对，我错了
You were right. l was wrong

1231
01:15:16,455 --> 01:15:18,389
不过我没时间听你说教
But this is not the time for the "l told you so" speech

1232
01:15:19,058 --> 01:15:22,994
丹尼当时在逃避他们的追捕
That day when Daniel Zavitz got hit by the fire truck, he was running

1233
01:15:23,062 --> 01:15:26,327
现在他们正在追我
The people that were chasing him, that's the people that are chasing me

1234
01:15:26,632 --> 01:15:27,997
这是真的吗？
- Bobby, are you serious ?

1235
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,100
我要你到费城的娘家
- Go to Philadelphia, stay with your family

1236
01:15:30,169 --> 01:15:31,431
给我时间解决这件事
- Just give me time to work this out

1237
01:15:31,504 --> 01:15:33,096
不行
- l don't think so

1238
01:15:33,172 --> 01:15:36,266
这是我的家，我不走
They're not chasing me out of my house

1239
01:15:36,342 --> 01:15:37,934
窗帘是我挑的
- l picked those drapes

1240
01:15:38,844 --> 01:15:40,539
谁还管窗帘呀？
- Shh, shh, shh. Nobody cares about the drapes

1241
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,805
拜托你让我作主，好吗？
Just one time can l make some decisions around here ?

1242
01:15:43,983 --> 01:15:46,679
到费城去帮我个忙，好吗？
Just go to Philadelphia. l need you to do that for me, okay ?

1243
01:15:47,553 --> 01:15:48,645
好啦
- Okay

1244
01:15:49,421 --> 01:15:50,615
我好想你
- l miss you

1245
01:16:00,533 --> 01:16:02,558
怎么穿起你的圣诞礼物
- You can't wear that. That's a Christmas present. - l know. l'm sorry

1246
01:16:02,668 --> 01:16:06,334
对不起，我想你，我好寂寞
But, baby, l missed you. l was lonely

1247
01:16:05,638 --> 01:16:07,970
你不能翻我的东西
How you just gonna go through my stuff like that ?

1248
01:16:08,174 --> 01:16:11,109
在我送你之前还是我的
Until l actually give it to you, that's still mine

1249
01:16:11,443 --> 01:16:13,877
我穿起来比较好看
Yeah, but it looks better on me, don't you think ?

1250
01:16:15,848 --> 01:16:17,782
你比儿子还坏
Baby, you're as bad as Eric

1251
01:16:18,684 --> 01:16:21,175
我好想念你
l missed you so much

1252
01:16:25,157 --> 01:16:26,021
怎么了？
- What ? - That was the night

1253
01:16:26,392 --> 01:16:29,850
那天晚上我把礼物带回家
That was the night that l came home with the presents

1254
01:16:30,196 --> 01:16:31,527
艾瑞克呢？
- Where is Eric ? - He's at Dylan's house

1255
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:35,427
他跟狄伦一起上学 怎么了？
He's probably on the way to school. What's going on ?

1256
01:16:35,501 --> 01:16:38,262
你拿枪干嘛？
[ Gasps ] What are you doing with that ?

1257
01:16:38,771 --> 01:16:41,535
我不要，别给我 拿去
- Shh, baby. Shh, shh. - What do you want me to do with this ?

1258
01:16:41,607 --> 01:16:43,666
我要钱和衣服
Get me some money. l need some clothes. Tell Maria we need her car

1259
01:16:43,776 --> 01:16:49,582
玛莉亚的车该没被窃听
Chances are they wouldn't have bugged it. Oh, shit. Eric

1260
01:16:48,013 --> 01:17:00,489
艾瑞克 总部，一号报告
The nanny is leaving

1261
01:17:00,559 --> 01:17:02,550
保母要走了，请指示
- Please advise. - Stay put

1262
01:17:02,628 --> 01:17:05,392
留下来，比翰在学校等
We have satellite tracking and Bingham at the school

1263
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,808
让我跟踪保母
Aw, man, let me follow the nanny

1264
01:17:18,711 --> 01:17:20,542
她没刮腿毛
She doesn't shave her legs. Jesus !

1265
01:17:20,613 --> 01:17:24,078
这种女人好性感
Women like that are so hot

1266
01:17:24,683 --> 01:17:26,207
有人跟来吗？
- [ Dean ] ls there anybody following us ?

1267
01:17:26,285 --> 01:17:27,775
没有，狄先生
- No. No, Mr. Bobby

1268
01:17:27,953 --> 01:17:30,615
开快点，你得赶在他们前面
Drive a little faster. l wanna catch 'em before they get to school

1269
01:17:36,362 --> 01:17:40,162
他们在那儿 叫他们上车
- There they are. - Pull up and tell them to get into the car

1270
01:17:40,432 --> 01:17:41,558
好
Okay

1271
01:17:43,202 --> 01:17:45,534
艾瑞克、狄伦，上车
Eric, Dylan, get in the car, please

1272
01:17:45,604 --> 01:17:46,571
没关系
- No, we're okay.

1273
01:17:46,639 --> 01:17:48,038
快上车
- Get in the car right now

1274
01:17:48,107 --> 01:17:49,938
学校就在前面
- But school's right down the block

1275
01:17:50,776 --> 01:17:53,176
听我的话，上车
- You heard me. Now, get

1276
01:18:04,523 --> 01:18:05,512
你们好
- What's up, fellas ? - Dad ?

1277
01:18:06,058 --> 01:18:08,049
爸？别转头，坐好
No. Turn around. Sit down. 

1278
01:18:08,394 --> 01:18:09,053
往前看
Face forward

1279
01:18:09,128 --> 01:18:10,891
可是K 听我的话
- But, Dad-- - What did l say, Eric ?

1280
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:15,596
你们乖乖地坐好别东张西望
We're gonna play a game. Pick a spot and look right at it

1281
01:18:15,934 --> 01:18:17,959
别让人知道我在
You can't let anyone know l'm back here, okay ?

1282
01:18:19,004 --> 01:18:20,995
儿子，我好想你
How you been, E. ? l missed you, man

1283
01:18:21,173 --> 01:18:23,607
爸，我也想你 你上哪儿了？
l missed you, too, Dad. Where did you go ?

1284
01:18:23,942 --> 01:18:26,672
我忙着处理一个案子
Oh, they've been keeping me really busy on this case

1285
01:18:26,945 --> 01:18:28,674
忙得要死
They're trying to work me to death

1286
01:18:29,214 --> 01:18:30,806
你跟妈要离婚吗？
- Are you and Mom getting a divorce ?

1287
01:18:30,883 --> 01:18:31,872
往前看
- Face forward

1288
01:18:32,618 --> 01:18:35,416
胡说八道，我们不会离婚
What are you talking about ? No, we're not getting a divorce

1289
01:18:35,487 --> 01:18:38,581
我们吵了一架，这很平常
We had a little fight. Sometimes married couples have fights

1290
01:18:38,691 --> 01:18:40,386
你不必担心
- That's nothing for you to worry about

1291
01:18:40,859 --> 01:18:41,848
谁吵赢了？
- Who won the fight ?

1292
01:18:42,061 --> 01:18:45,189
老爸说话算话，妈妈敢不听？
This is your dad, Eric. When l put my foot down, that's it

1293
01:18:45,464 --> 01:18:46,453
我老妈赢了
- My mom won

1294
01:18:46,598 --> 01:18:49,032
我要问你
- l have a question l need to ask you

1295
01:18:49,201 --> 01:18:52,193
你一定要说实话
lt is absolutely imperative that you tell me the truth

1296
01:18:52,604 --> 01:18:56,165
不管你说什么都不会有麻烦
Now, no matter what you say, you are not going to get in trouble

1297
01:18:56,709 --> 01:18:58,301
好了吗？ 好了
- All right ? You ready ? - Yeah

1298
01:18:58,544 --> 01:19:01,240
记得我带回家的圣诞礼物
You remember that night l came home with those Christmas presents--

1299
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:03,371
我只偷看袋子
l just looked in the bag, Dad

1300
01:19:03,449 --> 01:19:05,781
已经拆开的我才拿走
l wouldn't have taken it, except it was already open

1301
01:19:06,118 --> 01:19:07,710
你没事了
All right, 

1302
01:19:08,454 --> 01:19:09,386
我要拿回来
so we're clear. But l need it

1303
01:19:09,455 --> 01:19:11,184
我会给你一个新的
 l promise l'll get you another one

1304
01:19:11,457 --> 01:19:13,425
爸 怎么了？
- Dad. - What's the matter ?

1305
01:19:13,492 --> 01:19:14,356
它坏了
 lt's broken

1306
01:19:15,194 --> 01:19:18,322
不是他的错，本来就坏了
lt's not Eric's fault, Mr. Dean. lt was always broken

1307
01:19:18,664 --> 01:19:20,825
一打开荧幕就乱闪
The screen just scrambles when you turn it on

1308
01:19:20,999 --> 01:19:22,990
我还是要，东西在吗？
- But l need it. Do you have it here ?

1309
01:19:23,502 --> 01:19:24,833
在
- Yeah, we have it

1310
01:19:24,903 --> 01:19:26,996
从旁边递过来给我
Eric, just pass it around the side to me

1311
01:19:48,794 --> 01:19:51,695
你好，我叫李昂纽曼
[ Dean ] Yes. Hello. Hi. My name is Leon Newman

1312
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:53,491
请问你贵姓？
l'm sorry. What's your name, ma'am ?

1313
01:19:54,032 --> 01:19:57,559
我住在波蒙特街454号
Sergeant Miller. Yes, we live at 454 Beaumont Terrace

1314
01:19:57,636 --> 01:19:59,866
这是我妈的房子
Actually, my mother lives there. l'm calling for her

1315
01:20:00,038 --> 01:20:03,269
一辆箱型车一直停在外面
There's been a van sitting outside all day

1316
01:20:03,442 --> 01:20:05,808
我不想惹麻烦
l'm not trying to get anyone in trouble

1317
01:20:05,878 --> 01:20:08,745
不过他们可能在贩毒
but l think they might be doing drugs or something in there

1318
01:20:08,814 --> 01:20:10,543
请你派警车过来
l was hoping you could send a car by

1319

请去查停在波蒙街的箱型车
- [ Beeping ] - Thirty-one Allison, all available units

1320
01:20:14,486 --> 01:20:19,814
可能有人贩毒
Check out a white van at 454 Beaumont for a possible 1031 narcotics violation

1321
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:22,150
老天，那是我们
Oh, eat me. That's us

1322
01:20:35,690 --> 01:20:39,922
（蕾秋班克公寓，11时24分）

蕾秋K蕾秋K

“你的爱，罗伯狄恩”


1326
01:22:55,514 --> 01:22:57,243
开门，快开门
- Open the door. Open the door !

1327
01:23:06,759 --> 01:23:08,659
我叫你离我远点
l thought l told you to stay the fuck away from me

1328
01:23:08,761 --> 01:23:10,695
现在别吵，快开车
Please, not now. Just drive

1329
01:23:17,870 --> 01:23:18,962
怎么回事？
- All right, what happened ?

1330
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:21,570
蕾秋死了
- Rachel's dead

1331
01:23:25,978 --> 01:23:30,642
我叫你别去找她
l told you not to contact her. l told you

1332
01:23:35,821 --> 01:23:36,719
下车

01:33:22,441 --> 01:33:23,465
这地方要爆炸
This bitch is gonna blow !

1467
01:33:23,909 --> 01:33:25,240
快走K快走K
Go, go, go !

1468
01:33:43,829 --> 01:33:46,593

Come on ! Go !

1469
01:33:50,502 --> 01:33:52,231

Move ! Move ! Move !

1470
01:33:56,141 --> 01:33:56,800
快走


1471
01:34:00,545 --> 01:34:02,410

Move ! Move !

1472
01:34:13,225 --> 01:34:15,250
怎么回事？ 我把大楼炸掉
- What is happening ? - l blew up the building

1473
01:34:15,327 --> 01:34:17,557
为什么？ 因为你打了通电话
- Why ? - Because you made a phone call !

1474
01:34:27,806 --> 01:34:29,034
叫他停车
- Tell him to pull over !

1475
01:34:29,107 --> 01:34:30,506
马上停车
- Pull the vehicle over now !

1476
01:34:35,747 --> 01:34:36,736
快停车
Pull over now !

1477
01:34:53,565 --> 01:34:54,463
上膛
Pump action !

1478
01:35:13,518 --> 01:35:14,485
可恶
Gosh damn !

1479
01:35:19,491 --> 01:35:20,651
油管一定断了
Fuel line must be broken

1480
01:35:22,861 --> 01:35:24,123
快灭火
- Get it out ! Goddamn !

1481
01:35:24,896 --> 01:35:25,794
停车
- Stop the car !

1482
01:35:34,706 --> 01:35:35,638
磁碟片呢？
- Where's the disk ? - Shit !

1483
01:35:37,809 --> 01:35:39,709
该死
No ! Shit !

1484
01:35:40,478 --> 01:35:41,775
救得了吗？
 Look, is there any way to save it ?

1485
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:43,142
全毁了
- Ah, that's ruined

1486
01:35:43,481 --> 01:35:44,140
怎么办？
- What do we do ?

1487
01:35:44,616 --> 01:35:45,984
我要走了
- l'm leaving.- Subjects heading west across the coal fields

1488
01:35:45,984 --> 01:35:47,645
目标往西前进
- l'm leaving. - Subjects heading west across the coal fields

1489
01:35:47,919 --> 01:35:48,943
你要一走了之？
- You're leaving ? - The disk is gone

1490
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:51,511
没有磁碟片就没戏唱
We've got nothing. lt's over

1491
01:36:04,502 --> 01:36:06,993
把枪放下
We have control. Put down your weapons

1492
01:36:15,013 --> 01:36:18,779
我根本就不想要拿到磁片
You think l wanted that idiot to put that goddamn disk--

1493
01:36:18,850 --> 01:36:20,841
我不管你想什么
Who gives a fuck what you wanted ?

1494
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:24,111
你把蕾秋害死，害我被追杀
Since you've shown up, Rachel's dead and the N.S.A.'s onto me

1495
01:36:27,959 --> 01:36:29,927
你被追杀，什么意思？
Onto you ? What do you mean onto you ? Onto you about what ?

1496
01:36:29,995 --> 01:36:33,797
你不是目标，我才是
You're not the target. l am

1497
01:36:45,677 --> 01:36:47,702
看到了，他就在前面
We got him. He's right in front of us

1498
01:36:50,582 --> 01:36:52,516

Come on, come on

1499
01:36:55,086 --> 01:36:56,747
他逃不了，逮到他了
We got him. He's got nowhere to go

1500
01:37:08,967 --> 01:37:11,231
他们在列车中间
Air One to ground, they're somewhere between the trains

1501
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,898
滚远一点
Get the fuck away from me

1502
01:37:18,877 --> 01:37:20,401
我们要绕回去
We're coming back around

1503
01:37:20,679 --> 01:37:22,044
你毁了我的生活
- You're blowing my whole life

1504
01:37:22,314 --> 01:37:23,508
什么生活？
- What life ?

1505
01:37:23,581 --> 01:37:26,583
你只会作茧自缚、离群索居 You live in a fucking jar…so the world
can't touch you

1506
01:37:26,651 --> 01:37:28,585
你才不关心蕾秋
And you didn't give a shit about Rachel !

1507
01:37:28,753 --> 01:37:31,221
你只关心她带来的生意
Just some package under seat number 32

1508
01:37:34,192 --> 01:37:36,023
揍我呀，你有毛病呀？
- Come on ! - Do you have a problem ?

1509
01:37:36,194 --> 01:37:37,821
动手呀
- Go on ! Do it !

1510
01:37:39,230 --> 01:37:42,461
我只有你，你也只有我
l'm all you've got ! And you're all l've got

1511
01:37:50,542 --> 01:37:52,407
他们往西走向公路
Heading west towards the freeway

1512
01:38:03,888 --> 01:38:06,220
给我下车
- Get out of the fucking car ! - All right

1513
01:38:07,025 --> 01:38:08,287
下车
- Come on. Get out. - All right

1514
01:38:08,393 --> 01:38:09,690
别这样
- Don't do this to me

1515
01:38:09,761 --> 01:38:10,819
乖乖走路吧K
- Tell your story walking

1516
01:38:11,663 --> 01:38:13,028
等一下
Hey, wait a minute. Don't-- Oh, for God sakes

1517
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:15,593
谢谢你救我一命
- Thanks for your help back at the train. - Wait a minute

1518
01:38:21,406 --> 01:38:24,898
我们追丢了，他们在桥下
Air One to ground, l think we lost them. They're somewhere beneath the overpass

1519
01:38:34,753 --> 01:38:37,847
你抢到一辆好车
Well, you certainly carjacked a really nice car

1520
01:38:38,556 --> 01:38:40,820
这算什么好车？
This is a piece of shit. What are you talking about ?

1521
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:46,326
我缺乏血糖会很急躁
[ Sighs ] l need sugar, you know. l'm getting cranky

1522
01:38:46,998 --> 01:38:48,158
那还用说
Getting ?

1523
01:38:49,034 --> 01:38:52,561
我有低血糖症，无法新陈代谢
l'm hypoglycemic. My body can't metabolize the sugar, so--

1524
01:38:52,637 --> 01:38:55,504
你没吃东西就变浑蛋？
So you're a pain in the ass when you don't eat

1525
01:38:55,940 --> 01:38:57,202
差不多
Basically

1526
01:38:57,909 --> 01:38:59,900
没错
Yeah. Right

1527
01:39:00,311 --> 01:39:01,869
那就去吃东西
- We should eat then

1528
01:39:02,213 --> 01:39:03,202
好吧
- Let's do that

1529
01:39:04,315 --> 01:39:05,748
他的真名是艾德华莱尔
[ Hicks ] His real name is Edward Lyle

1530
01:39:06,151 --> 01:39:09,746
德卓大学毕业，53年从军
Graduated from Drexel University. Enlisted in the army, 1953

1531
01:39:09,821 --> 01:39:12,984
在情报和通讯方面表现优异
Rapid promotion, excelled at intelligence and communications

1532
01:39:13,058 --> 01:39:14,992
65年加入国安局
- Join N.S.A. in '65

1533
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:16,591
当然了
- Of course

1534
01:39:17,595 --> 01:39:21,326
80年潜入地下消失无踪
He was in the agency till 1980 when he vanished and went underground

1535
01:39:20,598 --> 01:39:23,931
很久以前的事
- Hasn't been seen since. - That's a long time

1536
01:39:24,002 --> 01:39:26,334
执行过很多机密的行动
Lots of black bags, lots of deleteds

1537
01:39:26,671 --> 01:39:28,662
他也是爆破高手
He's familiar with explosives, obviously

1538
01:39:29,741 --> 01:39:33,336
最后的任务是78年在伊朗
His last assignment, he went into lran, late '78, after the Shah

1539
01:39:33,611 --> 01:39:36,444
这个人就是我们的问题
- This is our problem. - This man

1540
01:39:39,918 --> 01:39:46,448
我们协助阿富汗叛军打俄国人 the secret police supply weapons…
So, we were helping

1541
01:39:45,190 --> 01:39:51,158
我和搭档负责监听俄军通讯
to the Afghani rebels fighting the Soviets. My partner and l were on the eastern border monitoring Soviet military transmissions

1542
01:39:51,029 --> 01:39:53,896
其实很好玩，我喜欢伊朗人
lt was kind of fun actually. l liked the lranians

1543
01:39:53,998 --> 01:39:57,964
强硬派占领德黑兰的美国使馆
Back in Tehran, the hard-liners seized the embassy

1544
01:39:58,036 --> 01:40:00,436
一夜之间政权转移
and overnight, the whole country changed

1545
01:40:00,972 --> 01:40:04,135
伊朗政府马上翻脸，我逃出来
People we'd been working with, they turned on us. l got out

1546
01:40:04,709 --> 01:40:06,199
我的搭档没能逃走
My partner didn't

1547
01:40:06,945 --> 01:40:10,837
这项任务是外交上的污点
By the time l got home, the whole mission had become a press disaster waiting to happen

1548
01:40:10,949 --> 01:40:13,110
我们等于协助新的敌人
Aiding and abetting the new enemy

1549
01:40:13,585 --> 01:40:16,315
国安局忘了我的存在
The agency conveniently forgot l existed

1550
01:40:18,123 --> 01:40:19,647
我并不怪他们
l don't blame them

1551
01:40:20,425 --> 01:40:22,086
他们必须这么做
lt's what they had to do

1552
01:40:22,727 --> 01:40:24,558
我热爱国安局
l loved the agency

1553
01:40:26,097 --> 01:40:28,759
我热爱这份工作和同事
l loved the work. l loved the people

1554
01:40:29,434 --> 01:40:30,833
那是我的生命
lt was my whole life

1555
01:40:32,637 --> 01:40:34,901
你的搭档猫是蕾秋的父亲
Your partner was Rachel's father

1556
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:38,073
没错，我们说好了
Yeah. The idea was--

1557
01:40:38,476 --> 01:40:43,311
谁逃走就要照顾对方的家人
The idea always was that if one of us got out, he'd take care of the other's family

1558
01:40:43,381 --> 01:40:48,441
我答应他要把蕾秋照顾好
Rachel was all he had. So she became my promise to him

1559
01:40:48,353 --> 01:40:49,684
来吧
- [ Woman ] Here you go, hon

1560
01:40:50,455 --> 01:40:51,319
谢谢你
- Thank you

1561
01:40:55,927 --> 01:40:58,122
也许还能完成你的承诺
Maybe we can still keep that promise in a way

1562
01:40:58,563 --> 01:41:00,793
你跟我一样成为威胁
You're a threat now, just like l was

1563
01:41:01,466 --> 01:41:03,161
对他们是威胁？
Threat to whom ? To them ?

1564
01:41:04,035 --> 01:41:06,868
对你周遭的每一个人
To your family, friends, everyone you know, everyone you meet

1565
01:41:07,539 --> 01:41:09,473
所以我才躲起来
That's why l went away and didn't come back. 

1566
01:41:10,308 --> 01:41:11,605
你也得消失
You gotta go away, Robert

1567
01:41:11,910 --> 01:41:14,572
不，这是我的生活
No, l don't think so. This is my life

1568
01:41:14,846 --> 01:41:16,905
我要拿回以前的生活
l worked hard for it, and l want it back

1569
01:41:17,882 --> 01:41:19,782
我从小失去父亲
l grew up without a father. l know what that is

1570
01:41:20,118 --> 01:41:22,518
不能让我的妻儿也受苦
And l will not allow my family to go through that

1571
01:41:22,654 --> 01:41:24,713

Mommy

1572
01:41:24,789 --> 01:41:26,916

l don't wanna go home

1573
01:41:32,463 --> 01:41:35,057
想打我一拳吗？
Wanna take a poke at me ?

1574
01:41:36,334 --> 01:41:37,392
尽管打
- Come on

1575
01:41:37,835 --> 01:41:38,995
我不打老年人
- l don't hit senior citizens

1576
01:41:41,873 --> 01:41:43,807
过来，宝贝
- Oh, come here, Babe. - [ Purrs ]

1577
01:41:44,409 --> 01:41:45,467
过来
Come up here. Come on

1578
01:41:46,611 --> 01:41:50,103
打游击战你的弱点就是优势
ln guerilla warfare, you try to use your weaknesses as strengths

1579
01:41:50,715 --> 01:41:51,613
比如说？
- Such as ? - Well

1580
01:41:51,916 --> 01:41:58,813
当对手强大你很弱小 表示你较灵活，他们较笨拙
if they're big and you're small, then you're mobile and they're slow

1581
01:41:59,357 --> 01:42:01,018
你在暗，他们在明
You're hidden and they're exposed

1582
01:42:01,226 --> 01:42:01,749

You're hidden and they're exposed

1583
01:42:01,926 --> 01:42:04,010
别打赢不了的仗
Only fight battles you know you can win. That's the way the Vietcong did it

1584
01:42:04,010 --> 01:42:07,563
越共很清楚这点 （毕瑞公寓，8时07分）
Only fight battles you know you can win. That's the way the Vietcong did it. You capture their weapons and you use them against them the next time

1585
01:42:07,563 --> 01:42:10,828
用对手的武器对付他们
You capture their weapons and you use them against them the next time

1586
01:42:09,865 --> 01:42:13,631
他们越弱、你就越强
That way they're supplying you. You grow stronger as they grow weaker

1587
01:42:15,104 --> 01:42:16,264
穿起来
- Hey, try these

1588
01:42:16,739 --> 01:42:17,831
有别的吗？
- Can l have something else, please ?

1589
01:42:18,007 --> 01:42:19,201
有
- Yeah. Here

1590
01:42:19,442 --> 01:42:20,306
算了
- Never mind

1591
01:42:22,511 --> 01:42:23,705
我最好的夏威夷衫
- That's my best aloha shirt

1592
01:42:25,147 --> 01:42:26,375
逊毙了
- Well, say "aloha" to it

1593
01:42:35,491 --> 01:42:38,153
史提夫，我要器材
- Steve, how you doing ? Need some gear

1594
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:39,156
自己拿
- Howdy. Help yourself

1595
01:42:39,328 --> 01:42:41,660
这是比尔 嗨，比尔
- Hi, Bill. - Say hi to Bill. - How you doing, Bill ?

1596
01:42:42,465 --> 01:42:46,299
史提夫，影像传送器呢？
Steve, where's the two gigahertz video transmitters ?

1597
01:42:46,669 --> 01:42:48,500
你后面第二层
Right behind you, second shelf

1598
01:42:49,171 --> 01:42:51,162
史提夫？他不是比尔吗？
Steve ? l thought you said his name was Bill

1599
01:42:51,707 --> 01:42:53,436
