1
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:23,167
You're not looking at me, Mike.

2
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,172
You're not looking at me in the eyes.

3
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:31,133
That's weak.

4
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,427
Only weak people do that.

5
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:40,017
I could look you in the eye if-
if I wanted to, Daddy. I -

6
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,311
I just -

7
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,730
I just don't want to look you in the eye.

8
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:48,359
I guess you're just a weak person, hmm?

9
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,695
Must have got that from your mother.

10
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:57,034
It probably would have been better for you
had you been born a girl.

11
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:01,205
Then we could have named you Michelle.

12
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,749
Hmm?

13
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,293
You see, weakness is more
acceptable in a girl, Michelle.

14
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:07,545
Oh.

15
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:12,216
Oh, I'm sorry. I mean Mike.
I keep forgetting.

16
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:18,139
Wait a minute.

17
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,724
Why don't I call you Michelle
all the time? Hmm?

18
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,105
Then I wouldn't have to be so goddamn
fucking ashamed of you and your weaknesses.

19
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,232
I could just think of you
as a girl all the time, couldn't I?

20
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,860
Buy your frocks and your dresses and your
frilly hats and your frilly scarves.

21
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:34,113
And you could be -
You could be Daddy's little girl.

22
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:38,909
I wouldn't have to be so fucking ashamed of
being seen with you in public, would I? Eh?

23
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,581
What do you think of that, Michelle?

24
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,916
Sound like a good idea?

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,752
Don't, Daddy. Don't.

26
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,756
What? Did you say something?

27
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:57,219
Such a soft, little girl's voice.
I couldn't hear what you said.

28
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,514
I hate you, Daddy. I hate you.

29
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:03,601
- Speak up, girl!
- I hate you!

30
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:07,688
I hate you... because I love you.

31
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:14,320
It makes me feel guilty inside - hate.

32
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,490
I can't hardly speak.

33
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,159
Then don't speak.

34
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,870
Don't speak to me. Show me.

35
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,956
Don't tell me about it. I'm not interested
in what little girls have to say anyway.

36
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,750
Show me! Show me your anger!

37
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,211
Show me!
Then I can understand it.

38
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,133
There you are, Daddy.

39
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,969
There you are.

40
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,807
I see you, Michelle.

41
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,353
I see everything.

42
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,940
This is me, Daddy.

43
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:54,818
This is what you do to me inside.

44
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,614
Go all the way through it, Michelle.

45
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,785
Go all the way through it to the end.

46
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,829
Come out the other end.

47
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,332
Don't stop in the middle.

48
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,126
I'm watching you.

49
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,212
I'm watching everything you do, Mike.

50
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,507
Oh, Daddy.

51
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,863
Wow.

52
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,533
The man is a genius.

53
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,827
The man is a genius.

54
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,206
Dr. Raglan would like to thank you all
for coming this afternoon.

55
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,208
I believe your bus is waiting outside now.

56
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:52,793
Thank you.

57
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,473
Candy? It's me, honey.

58
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,441
Mmm!

59
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:01,987
On, Daddy. Daddy.

60
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:37,898
Okay, honey.

61
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:40,692
Warm enough?

62
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,871
There we go.

63
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,835
Okay, put the whale down, honey.
Turn around.

64
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,004
Hold your hair up now.

65
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,057
Oh, my God.

66
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,697
Yeah.

67
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:34,455
Sorry, Hal, but, uh, Mr.
Carveth is still here.

68
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:37,499
He's starting to get, uh,
passionate about the whole thing.

69
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,878
Okay. Send him in.

70
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,881
Mr. Carveth.

71
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,133
Thanks a lot.

72
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,635
Frank, it's been some time.

73
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,763
What can I do for you?

74
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:55,184
I want to see Nola.
I want to see my wife now.

75
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:58,645
You know she's still undergoing
intensive therapy.

76
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,689
I can't let you break that isolation.

77
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:04,026
Well, you let her see Candice
on the weekends, don't you?

78
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,945
Yes, Frank, I do.
But then that's different.

79
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:11,033
Regular visits from her daughter was built
into her program from the very start.

80
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,410
Yeah? Well, her program has just changed.

81
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:17,122
What do you mean, Frank?
You sound hostile.

82
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,376
Well, my daughter has been beaten -
severely.

83
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,171
And scratched and bitten.
And her mother did it.

84
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,716
Her mother who's under
your psychiatric care.

85
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:34,264
That's an incredibly heavy accusation
to make, Frank.

86
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:37,893
Did Candice tell you that?

87
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,271
Huh. Candice won't talk about it.

88
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:44,733
She pretends the whole thing
never happened.

89
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,360
But it was Nola.

90
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,530
Or some other crazy
you have stashed away up here.

91
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:53,283
Either way, no more weekends with Mummy.
The kid stays with me.

92
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:59,414
To take Candice away from her
at this stage...

93
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:02,501
could send Nola over into the deep end.

94
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,379
It's a critical time for her, Frank.

95
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:09,841
Yeah, well, I happen to think that Nola's
been in over her head for a long time now.

96
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:13,303
You have no legal right to deny access.

97
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,140
Anytime you'd like
to test the matter in open court...

98
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,978
I'd be more than happy to oblige.

99
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:25,148
For the ultimate good
of your own family, Frank...

100
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,652
we'd be prepared to do just that.

101
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,154
But don't you force it.

102
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,323
You bring Candy back to her mother
next weekend.

103
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,242
She won't harm the child.

104
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:38,078
There must be some other answer
to what you've seen.

105
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:42,499
Well, until you give me that answer,
Candy's not coming back.

106
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,851
<i>Yes, Hal.</i>

107
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:04,896
Chris, prepare Nola Carveth-Kelly
for another session tonight, will you?

108
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,273
<i>Sure.</i>

109
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:10,485
Oh, and, uh, Chris,
make it phase two after supper.

110
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,613
<i>Okay, Hal.</i>

111
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:19,661
This guy Raglan
is strictly an emotional opportunist.

112
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,788
He's a legit MD, right?

113
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:24,666
He's a real psychiatrist.

114
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,377
Yes.

115
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:32,966
Goddamn it! Psychoplasmics is a rip-off!

116
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,052
It's a sideshow. I've seen it in action.

117
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:40,223
Frank, it doesn't matter what you think.
Now you listen to me.

118
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:45,437
You call up this Raglan
and you be a real mensch with him.

119
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:50,067
Otherwise, it's just a matter of time
before the cops show up at your door...

120
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,111
and you lose your kid for good.

121
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:55,405
The law believes in motherhood.

122
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:03,872
If I can dig up enough testimony
to prove that Raglan's a dangerous fraud...

123
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,958
that Somafree is crawling with crazies -

124
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,877
It's no place for a kid anytime.

125
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,590
You're getting warmer.

126
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:17,177
But, you know, when Candy doesn't show up
at Somafree next weekend...

127
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,930
your wife can take
legal action immediately.

128
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:25,227
You could find yourself belted
with a writ in seven days.

129
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,981
If I give Nola enough time,
she'll really hurt the kid.

130
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,276
I know she will, Al.

131
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:38,156
I'll do anything I have to.

132
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,414
Oh, here's your daddy.

133
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,958
Oh.
I'll bet he knows all about this zipper.

134
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,793
There we go.

135
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,338
All set now.

136
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,721
I'd like to talk to you
sometime soon, Mr. Carveth...

137
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:46,725
about school activities and... Candy.

138
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,186
You missed the last open house.

139
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,605
Yeah.

140
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,065
Okay. Soon.

141
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,485
Oh.

142
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,405
Thanks.

143
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,866
See you tomorrow, Candy.

144
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:10,248
Thank you very much, Frank.

145
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:13,627
- For what?
- For bringing me my grandchild.

146
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,546
I know if it were up to Nola,
I'd never see Candice.

147
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,548
Juliana, that's not true.

148
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:21,051
Nola and I both know how much
she needs her grandma.

149
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,345
Especially now.

150
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,222
You're sweet.

151
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,685
I guess you know now what it feels like.

152
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,479
What it feels like?

153
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,940
Being a parent.

154
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,401
Being blamed for everything.

155
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,279
To have the past distorted
so you don't even recognize yourself in it.

156
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:44,658
Your child's version of the past, that is.

157
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,786
Juliana, Candice is only five.

158
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,206
She's working on it right now, believe me.

159
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,877
Thirty seconds after you're born,
you have a past.

160
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:59,923
And 60 seconds after that,
you start to lie to yourself about it.

161
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,717
Juliana.

162
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:09,850
I guess I've been indulging in a horrid
bout of nostalgia these last few days.

163
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,552
Must be the weather.

164
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,187
At least now I have a partner in crime.

165
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,065
- I gotta go.
- Of course.

166
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,278
Bye, Daddy.

167
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,958
Take your time. We'll both be just fine.

168
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,057
I'll be with you in a second, sweetie.
I'm just going to get a refill...

169
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,393
and then we'll look
at those lovely old pictures.

170
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,648
Mummy.

171
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,402
Yes, Candice?

172
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:04,613
Yes, sweetie?

173
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,325
Mummy, you hurt me.

174
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:13,204
You hit me with your fists,
and you scratched me with your nails. You -

175
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,291
You hurt me.

176
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,710
No, I didn't, sweetie.

177
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,338
You must have had a bad dream.

178
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:25,175
Mummies don't do that.
Mummies don't hurt their own children.

179
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,510
They don't?

180
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,722
They never do?

181
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,558
They never do?

182
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,523
They sometimes do.

183
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,945
Sometimes, but then they're bad mummies.

184
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,905
They're fucked-up mummies.

185
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,032
Like whose?

186
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,201
Like whose mummy?

187
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,666
Like mine was.

188
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,003
Fucked-up and bad.

189
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,215
No, I'm not, Nola.

190
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:10,136
You're being so unfair, sweetheart.
Mummies never do that.

191
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:13,431
Mummies never hurt their own children.

192
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,560
You did hurt me.

193
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,856
You beat me, and you scratched me.

194
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,317
You threw me down the stairs.

195
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,069
Show me what I did.

196
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,864
Don't stop it now, darling. You show me.

197
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:33,159
Show me your anger, Nola. Show it to me.

198
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:37,163
Go all the way through it.

199
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:40,417
Go all the way through it to the end.

200
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,878
Right to the end.

201
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,304
That one's my favorite.

202
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,933
- This one's your favorite?
- Yes.

203
00:16:57,017 --> 00:17:00,270
Mummy in the hospital
when she was a little girl.

204
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:04,983
Hmm. That's right. I remember this picture.

205
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,736
Your Grandpa Barton took this picture.

206
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:11,197
Tell me the rest of the story
that goes with the picture.

207
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,783
Why was Mummy in the hospital so much?

208
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,618
Well -

209
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,331
Some days she would wake up...

210
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:24,627
and she would be covered
with big, ugly bumps.

211
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,173
And the doctors were very worried...

212
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:32,052
because they could never find out what
those bumps all over her skin really were.

213
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,888
Then as soon as she became a teenager...

214
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:39,059
the bumps went away for good
and she never saw them again.

215
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:40,810
That's right.

216
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:07,629
Oh.

217
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,507
I guess I didn't stack
the dishes too well.

218
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,051
I better go see what the damage is.

219
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:19,182
While I'm there,
I think I'll freshen up both our drinks.

220
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,781
Please let me go!

221
00:21:19,703 --> 00:21:20,738
Jerry.

222
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,365
Hi, Frank.

223
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,492
You're really falling behind on this,
you know.

224
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:28,496
The Brenleys think that they're gonna be
moving in here by May.

225
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,581
Nah, we're not gonna make that for sure.

226
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,292
Maybe by June.

227
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,086
I just found out this morning that
the city plumbing permit got held up...

228
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:38,047
...because of a change
in the building code.

229
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,799
Mr. Carveth.

230
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,384
Telephone call for you.

231
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,969
All right.

232
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:56,774
- Hello?
<i>- Is that Mr. Carveth?</i>

233
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:58,359
- Yes.
<i>- Mr. Frank Carveth?</i>

234
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:01,654
- Yeah, this is Frank Carveth.
<i>- This is Sergeant Markle of 78 Division.</i>

235
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:04,490
One of our officers noticed
a broken kitchen window...

236
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:07,327
while on a routine patrol
of the neighborhood.

237
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,830
Found your mother-in-law's body
in the kitchen.

238
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,333
The murder weapon
was on the floor next to her.

239
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:18,087
He then found your daughter upstairs,
sound asleep in the bedroom.

240
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:22,342
It seems she missed the whole thing.

241
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,385
Where is she now? I'd like to see her.

242
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:27,347
She's with our police psychologist,
Dr. Birkin.

243
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,224
Psychologist? Why? Was she hysterical?

244
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:33,478
No. No. On the contrary.

245
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,938
She was very cool
throughout the whole thing.

246
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,816
A little too cool, I thought.

247
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,653
So I asked Dr. Birkin to talk with her,
just for an opinion.

248
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:48,201
In the meantime, can you think
of the names of any persons...

249
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,536
who would have a motive
to murder this woman?

250
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:55,124
You see, it doesn't seem to me to be
a simple case of an interrupted break-in...

251
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,170
or, say, a rape-murder.

252
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,759
Juliana had a long series of lovers.
I never met any of them.

253
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,761
What about her husband?

254
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:11,891
His name is Barton Kelly.
He works for the government out in Halifax.

255
00:23:13,374 --> 00:23:15,311
They were divorced over 10 years ago.

256
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,275
Dr. Birkin.

257
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,570
- You must be Candice's father.
- Yeah. I'd like to take her home now.

258
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:27,073
Mr. Carveth, please.
Give me just two minutes with you.

259
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:29,158
It's important. Have a seat.

260
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:35,373
Speaking bluntly, I don't think that your daughter
escaped this incident entirely unscathed.

261
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:39,085
- You think she saw what happened.
- I suspect she did.

262
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:42,255
Or she saw something
which traumatized her...

263
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:45,091
confused her, disturbed her in some way.

264
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:48,803
The officer who found her said
that she was very difficult to wake up.

265
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:51,931
To me, that indicates
a kind of abnormal deep sleep...

266
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,766
which a lot of people, even children...

267
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,562
will use to escape something
that's too painful to face.

268
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:01,858
And she still says that she doesn't remember
being brought to her grandmother's...

269
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,235
or seeing her at all.

270
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:07,113
Do you think she'll remember eventually?

271
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:10,491
Mr. Carveth, I think you must
encourage her to remember.

272
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:12,660
Why?

273
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:16,080
My concern is that the child could have
a very serious breakdown...

274
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:19,125
if she doesn't come to terms
with what she's experienced.

275
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:23,713
You see, these things tend to express
themselves in one way or another.

276
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,132
I've seen five-year-olds
like your daughter...

277
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,843
with ulcers as bad
as any middle-aged businessman.

278
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,762
Okay, okay. I get the picture.

279
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:34,223
Now can I take her home?

280
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:36,517
- I think that's fine.
- No problem.

281
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:56,621
<i>What we're gonna do is we're gonna get
Ralph to stand straight up in the air.</i>

282
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:58,664
<i>But only with your help.
On the count of three...</i>

283
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:01,167
<i>I'll say “One, two, three.
Stand up, Ralph.”</i>

284
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,836
<i>Then I want everybody to clap loudly.
He'll stand right up in the air.</i>

285
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,379
<i>Everybody ready?</i>

286
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:07,298
<i>One...</i>

287
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:21,604
You're sure you don't want a story?

288
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,023
We don't have to read, you know.

289
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,108
I can make one up for you.

290
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,739
Do you want to tell <i>me</i> a story?

291
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:34,158
About what happened today at Grandmas?

292
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:43,543
You go to sleep, honey.

293
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:46,128
I'll leave the hall light on.

294
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,518
Damn.

295
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:06,941
Nola, no outside calls.
You're in isolation. You know that.

296
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,985
I tried to reach Dr. Raglan.

297
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,529
- He hasn't come.
- He's on his way.

298
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,824
Chris...

299
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,245
is something wrong?

300
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,122
Anything?

301
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:24,500
Then it's me again.

302
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:29,338
Nothing's wrong, except with me.

303
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:34,343
No, no, that's Frank -
Frank talking, Frank twisting my words.

304
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,262
He won't be patient.

305
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:39,223
He won't trust me.
He won't wait until I get well.

306
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,602
He thinks that I'm -

307
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:44,645
that I'm turning into my mother...

308
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:46,439
day by day, moment by moment.

309
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:50,901
He thinks that I'm trying
to make Candy into - into baby Nola.

310
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:53,154
Is he right?

311
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:58,868
No, no, no, no.
That's the last thing on earth I...

312
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:06,917
Who's that?

313
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:13,549
It's Daddy.

314
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,635
Oh!

315
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,470
Frank hates me, Daddy.

316
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,680
He despises me.

317
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,017
He thinks that I'm trying to harm
our little girl...

318
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,146
and I know that he's thinking of a way
to take her away.

319
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:30,191
And that's very unfair of him.
That's very arrogant of him.

320
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:33,319
You mustn't be too hard on him,
Nola, sweetheart.

321
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,696
He's just trying to be
a good, protective father.

322
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:40,159
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

323
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:43,454
He's just doing
what a good father should do.

324
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:45,915
He's protecting his little girl.
Now, there's -

325
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,917
There's nothing wrong with that, is there?

326
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,835
He doesn't want to see her hurt.

327
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,005
He doesn't want to see her hurt by anybody,
not even her own mother.

328
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:55,091
Now, is there anything wrong with that?

329
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,802
Is there?

330
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:59,428
No.

331
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,349
No, there isn't.

332
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:09,563
After all, that's just
what I did for you, isn't it?

333
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:12,024
Hmm?

334
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:15,945
Frank's protecting Candy
the same way as I protected you, isn't he?

335
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,824
Well, isn't he?

336
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,450
No.

337
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,913
No? What do you mean no?

338
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:30,042
- What do you mean when you say no?
- I love you, Daddy.

339
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:32,878
What do you mean when you say no?

340
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:35,381
I don't want you to think
that I don't love you.

341
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,383
What do you mean when you say no?

342
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:38,968
I mean you didn't.

343
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,763
Didn't?

344
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:44,473
Didn't what?

345
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,854
You didn't protect me.

346
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,731
You didn't.

347
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:53,566
You didn't. You didn't. You didn't.

348
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,901
And you should have.

349
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,322
You should have.

350
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:05,536
You shouldn't have
looked away when she hit me.

351
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:13,753
And you shouldn't have walked away
from the table when she twisted my words.

352
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,838
You should have stopped her.

353
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,013
You should have hit her when she hit me!

354
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,724
You should have slapped her
when she slapped me!

355
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:29,560
Oh, God, I love you.

356
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,816
But you didn't protect me...

357
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,860
and you should have.

358
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,446
You pretended it wasn't happening.

359
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,448
You looked away.

360
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:46,202
And you should have.

361
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,371
Why didn't you?

362
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:53,000
Why didn't you?

363
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:56,504
Didn't you love me?

364
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:40,882
Look, there he is.

365
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:43,467
There's Grandpa Barton.

366
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:45,094
Barton.

367
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:47,763
Oh, hello, Frank. How you doing?

368
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:49,348
- Good to see you.
- Let me take that.

369
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,684
Hello. How you doing, Candy?

370
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,562
I guess you don't remember
your old granddad, eh?

371
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:57,857
Right this way.

372
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,026
You didn't have to come way out here, Frank.
We could have met later at the hotel.

373
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,863
I just didn't like the idea
of you coming in alone.

374
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:05,906
How long are you planning to stay in town?

375
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,742
Well, I guess we could have
the funeral tomorrow, but, uh...

376
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:10,828
Juliana's parents might want
to come in from Arizona.

377
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:13,038
Then there's that sister in Vancouver.

378
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:15,165
I don't know just how
it's going to work out.

379
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:18,335
- What hotel are you staying in?
- Park Plaza.

380
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:22,923
You know, I was even thinking about
going out to that old house again.

381
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:26,468
I still have the key after all these years.

382
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:30,723
Juliana used to make a big fuss
about never having changed the locks.

383
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,933
I could never understand why.

384
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:36,353
Maybe it's because she really couldn't
admit that we were finished.

385
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,815
Ah, Frank, when I think
about you and Nola...

386
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,067
and this sweet child...

387
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:44,612
having to go through the same heartaches
we went through, it's -

388
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:47,406
it's enough to make you cry.

389
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:50,659
Yes, it is.

390
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:32,159
Uh, I'm here to see Mr. Hartog.

391
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,744
Mr. Jan Hartog.

392
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,264
Come in. Step right in.

393
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:04,400
Sit down. Yeah. I'll be right there.

394
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,948
Sit down. I'll be with you in a second.

395
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:15,911
Goddamn son of a bitch.

396
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,498
I don't know. I don't know.

397
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,960
You know, I just don't know.

398
00:33:24,343 --> 00:33:25,129
Okay.

399
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:28,132
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

400
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,271
That's my, uh -

401
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:45,024
my heart over there on the floor.

402
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:48,110
- Your heart?
- My second heart.

403
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:52,239
I mean, your first heart makes your -
makes your blood circulate, right?

404
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:56,243
But what about your, uh, lymphatic fluids?

405
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:58,162
Well, I don't know.

406
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:02,374
Well, movement -walking, running, fucking,
rolling on the floor, anything.

407
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:07,379
I mean, people have this whole other
system they don't even know about.

408
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:08,964
The lymphatic system.

409
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:14,470
It's just like the blood system with its
own style of-of veins and arteries...

410
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,805
but - but no heart.

411
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:21,268
You have to keep moving.
You have to circulate.

412
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:24,063
And, uh, they've just given me pills.

413
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:26,774
They do that every day!

414
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:29,068
And, uh - And I've gotta -

415
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:32,154
I've gotta move 'em
through the lymphatic system.

416
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:36,492
Goddamn it.

417
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,749
Pardon my sweat.

418
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,876
I'm gonna take a bath real soon.

419
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:51,924
So, uh, Mr.
Um, uh, Carveth...

420
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,967
how did you get my name?

421
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:56,053
My lawyer knows your lawyer.

422
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:59,139
Oh, I see. I get it.
And is your - is your lawyer...

423
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:02,267
preparing a case against Raglan too?

424
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:03,894
Basically, yes.

425
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:06,271
Uh, slightly different from yours.

426
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:08,482
Yeah? How different?

427
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,944
Well, my wife is still
in therapy with Raglan.

428
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:17,449
Uh, I'm claiming psychological damage,
uh, not physiological.

429
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:21,078
Oh, I see. Well, give him
some more time with your wife...

430
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:24,206
and you'll be able to claim
physiological damage too.

431
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:28,377
Won't this look impressive in court?

432
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:34,424
You like it? I do.

433
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:38,804
That's Raglan. That's Psychoplasmics.

434
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:42,141
It's called lymphosarcoma.

435
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:44,351
And it's spreading.

436
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:48,689
It's a form of cancer
of the lymphatic system.

437
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,774
You blame Raglan for that?

438
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:54,194
Oh, Raglan did it.

439
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:58,407
I mean, Raglan encouraged my body to-to -

440
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:02,369
to revolt against me, you know.

441
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,204
And it did.

442
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:08,500
Now I have a small
revolution on my hands...

443
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:11,587
and I'm not putting it down
very successfully.

444
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,507
Then your lawyer really thinks he can
prove Raglan's responsible?

445
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:17,050
Are you kidding me?

446
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:19,303
You can't prove a thing like -
like that in court.

447
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:22,514
Right from square one, you're into -
you're into, what, metaphysics.

448
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:24,224
Mmm.

449
00:36:24,308 --> 00:36:28,312
I mean, how do you know
I'm not gonna get cancer at age 32...

450
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:32,274
whether I'd gone into
Psychoplasmics therapy or not?

451
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:36,361
No, no, no.
We'd get laughed out of court.

452
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:38,989
Well, then why are you going into court?

453
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:42,826
Revenge.

454
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,995
Yeah, revenge.

455
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:49,750
Even if we lose, people'll get nervous
about Psychoplasmics.

456
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:52,711
It will be bad publicity.

457
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,171
You know?

458
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:57,174
They won't even remember
whether we won or lost.

459
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:59,718
They'll just remember the slogan -

460
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:03,764
“Psychoplasmics can cause cancer.”

461
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:05,849
Catchy, huh?

462
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:10,312
Is that gonna help?

463
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:15,567
Maybe.

464
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:17,444
I'm not alone, you know.

465
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:21,531
I mean, I'm in touch with a lot of people
who did Psychoplasmics.

466
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,826
We might form a club.

467
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:30,666
I... I... I want to help you.

468
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:34,586
Okay. Thanks.

469
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:56,108
Dr. Raglan?

470
00:37:58,652 --> 00:37:59,945
Yes.

471
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:03,365
I'm Barton Kelly, Nola Carveth's father.

472
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,659
I'm glad to meet you.

473
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,537
I'm sorry to, uh, accost you like this...

474
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,540
but, uh, your receptionist
wasn't too helpful.

475
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,001
Yes, well, she probably knew
I was on my way to -

476
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:18,672
Did you know that Nola's mother died
yesterday, that she was murdered?

477
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:21,675
Yes. The police spoke to me.

478
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:24,845
- Then you've told her?
- No, I haven't.

479
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:28,724
Well, then,
that's why I'm here - to tell her.

480
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:33,312
Mr. Kelly, your wife's death
was a tragic and shocking thing.

481
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:35,522
That's why Nola must not be told.

482
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:38,317
What?

483
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,862
Nola is going through
a very critical stage in her therapy.

484
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:43,947
I'm not sure she could take it.

485
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:48,493
Are you saying that I'm just supposed
to bury the girl's mother...

486
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:50,162
and not tell her about it?

487
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,456
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

488
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:59,296
You are one ignorant
son of a bitch, Dr. Raglan.

489
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:08,722
Now, I have left my phone number
on your front desk.

490
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:13,685
If I don't hear from my daughter
by tomorrow afternoon...

491
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:17,064
I'm coming back up here to get her.

492
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,321
Shall I have him stopped?

493
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:27,282
No, no, that's all right.

494
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:29,409
He's drunk.

495
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:13,328
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

496
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:15,872
You two look like you're having fun.

497
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:18,125
We were!

498
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:20,669
Daddy, Miss Mayer said she was starving.

499
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,130
Can we feed her at our place tonight?

500
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:25,090
Candy.

501
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:27,175
We could if she wanted to.

502
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:30,178
What do you think?

503
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:32,639
Well, I -

504
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:35,350
We could talk after Candy goes to bed.

505
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:38,687
Sure.

506
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,480
Sure.

507
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:48,029
As soon as Candy realized
she had me alone...

508
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:51,116
she got me to play
mother and daughter with her.

509
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:56,121
She obviously needs mothering
and isn't getting it.

510
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,706
Yeah.

511
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:03,795
Sometimes it just kills me to think that
I might have screwed my kid up already.

512
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:05,714
She's not even six.

513
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,757
It's not just you.

514
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:09,718
No.

515
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,971
No, sometimes when I'm being easy on
myself, I say, “Well, it's not your fault.

516
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,973
You got taken in.

517
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,976
You got involved with a woman
who married you for your sanity...

518
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,061
hoping it would rub off.”

519
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,316
Instead, it started to work the other way.

520
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,447
Excuse me.

521
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:35,160
Hello.

522
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,162
<i>It's Barton Kelly, Frank.</i>

523
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,747
<i>How are you?</i>

524
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,165
Just mediocre.

525
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:41,917
<i>How are you?</i>

526
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,712
I made a mistake, Frank.

527
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,797
I came back to the old place.

528
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:50,717
It's got me, Frank.

529
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:54,804
I'm depressed as hell.

530
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:57,933
Barton, get in a cab, will you?

531
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:01,019
- Just tell him to take...
<i>- That's not all.</i>

532
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:02,938
<i>There's Nola too.</i>

533
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,525
How do you mean?

534
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:09,277
I went up to that place to see her.

535
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,364
They wouldn't even let me talk to her.

536
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:15,158
<i>They said no to me, her own father.</i>

537
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:16,743
Jesus.

538
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:20,038
So I'm going back up there to Somafree.

539
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:22,624
<i>We'll leave just as soon
as you get here, Frank.</i>

540
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,626
As soon as <i>I</i> get there?

541
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:28,213
I'll be waiting for you.
I know you'll want to go up there with me.

542
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:30,382
You're not far from here, are you?

543
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,384
<i>Barton, listen to me.</i>

544
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:35,387
<i>I don't think that's
a very smart thing to do.</i>

545
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,431
Well, I'm doing it, Frank,
with or without you.

546
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:41,393
Okay, okay.

547
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:44,396
<i>I'm only about 15 minutes away.
Wait for me, Barton.</i>

548
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,022
I'll be there.

549
00:42:46,106 --> 00:42:48,108
You're a good lad, Frank.

550
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,946
We'll go up there together
and kick their ass.

551
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,032
I'm waiting on you, Frank.

552
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,333
I've a feeling I've just
been recruited to babysit.

553
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:09,212
Please, would you? It'll take 45 minutes.

554
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:10,964
He's drunk.

555
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:14,217
He'll drive his car off a bridge or something
unless I talk some sense into him.

556
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:18,013
- Forty-five minutes?
- That's all it'll take.

557
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,307
- Okay.
- Thanks.

558
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:23,476
Help yourself to some coffee.

559
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:26,146
Oh, here.

560
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,107
Look at this while I'm gone.

561
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,610
If you like it, I'll give it to you.

562
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:33,194
Forty-five minutes.

563
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,541
Oh, Juliana.

564
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:38,505
I never meant it to be this way.

565
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:34,727
Nola?

566
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:08,928
Barton.

567
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:12,849
It's me.

568
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,479
Barton!

569
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:27,322
Oh, no.

570
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:31,576
Oh, shit.

571
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:00,873
I can't get over it.

572
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:04,043
The thing was in the house.
It was in the house all the time.

573
00:50:04,127 --> 00:50:05,628
We searched the place.

574
00:50:05,712 --> 00:50:08,715
But we weren't looking for anything
that small, and we missed it.

575
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:12,218
We were spending our time
checking out an Estonian musician.

576
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:14,721
Have you found out
who it belongs to - the kid?

577
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:16,139
No.

578
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:20,226
My guess is some crazy woman didn't want
anyone to know she had a deformed child.

579
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:24,564
She's had this kid locked up in an attic
for years and never told anybody.

580
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:26,733
Wouldn't be the first time.

581
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,031
Hello.

582
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:36,659
- Hello?
<i>- Who's this?</i>

583
00:50:36,743 --> 00:50:39,912
Ruth Mayer.
Did you want to speak with Frank Carveth?

584
00:50:39,996 --> 00:50:43,624
<i>Ruth Mayer?
From Crell Street School?</i>

585
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:45,043
Yes.

586
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:46,711
Is this Mrs. Carveth?

587
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:51,883
<i>Are you and my husband having your own
private PTA meeting, Miss Mayer?</i>

588
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:54,802
I won't even bother to answer that.

589
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:56,804
<i>You bitch!</i>

590
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:59,557
<i>You're killing my family!</i>

591
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,142
<i>You bitch!</i>

592
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:33,674
<i>Our friend has very strange eyes.</i>

593
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:36,552
They have irises, but no retinas.

594
00:51:36,636 --> 00:51:39,555
I should think his vision of the world
is very distorted.

595
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:42,558
And I'm pretty certain he sees things
only in black and white.

596
00:51:42,642 --> 00:51:44,352
No colors.

597
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:46,687
The upper lip is cleft.

598
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:48,773
A real harelip.

599
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:51,109
But the palate is not.

600
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:54,362
And the tongue is too thick and inflexible
for proper speech.

601
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,281
He has no teeth...

602
00:51:57,365 --> 00:52:02,370
but you can get a pretty nasty bite
from these strange beak-like gums.

603
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:04,664
<i>Why did it die?</i>

604
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:08,167
<i>Well, I found some sort of
collapsed, fleshy sac...</i>

605
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:10,837
<i>between the little
fellow's shoulder blades.</i>

606
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,841
It contains traces
of a solid nutrient material...

607
00:52:14,924 --> 00:52:16,968
a bit like the yolk sac of certain fish...

608
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:19,512
or a... camel's hump.

609
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:23,850
Basically, it's a gas tank.
It was full at birth.

610
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:28,271
Once the hump material
is completely assimilated...

611
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:31,315
I think the creature
simply starves to death.

612
00:52:31,399 --> 00:52:33,734
Runs out of gas, so to speak.

613
00:52:34,986 --> 00:52:37,989
<i>And that brings us to the
last point of interest.</i>

614
00:52:38,865 --> 00:52:41,450
<i>There's an external deformity.</i>

615
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:45,913
I mean, apart from
the lack of sexual organs.

616
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:50,251
It's extremely subtle
and extremely provocative.

617
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:54,463
I wonder if either of you have noticed.

618
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:57,967
- It has no navel.
- No what?

619
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,594
No belly button.

620
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:02,305
The thing has no belly button.

621
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:03,848
That's right.

622
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:08,186
And that means this creature
has never really been born.

623
00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:11,189
At least not the way
human beings are born.

624
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:12,857
Jesus.

625
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:24,702
You're the beginning
of the end, Miss Mayer.

626
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:29,040
The beginning of the end for me,
my family, my dream.

627
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:30,791
So sad.

628
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:34,462
And I feel so guilty for my part in it.

629
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:36,756
I wish it had never happened.

630
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:41,969
I wish we could be together again,
just the three of us.

631
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:44,680
You're kidding yourself.

632
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:48,017
Right now you're dreaming.

633
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,436
From what Frank tells me,
it was lousy from the very start.

634
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:53,147
You never had anything real together.

635
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,484
It would be better for everybody if you -

636
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,819
well, if Frank divorced you
and married me.

637
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:02,823
We'd still let you see Candy
at the weekends.

638
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:05,785
That stinks!

639
00:54:06,786 --> 00:54:08,996
That stinks.

640
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:13,918
We had a lot. We had beautiful things,
things that you couldn't understand.

641
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:18,047
And we'll have them again
if you'd just leave him alone...

642
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:23,010
and stop poisoning him against me
and taking advantage of his loneliness.

643
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:28,182
Then he'd wait for me.

644
00:54:29,392 --> 00:54:32,603
He'd help me to get better
instead of abandoning me.

645
00:54:33,813 --> 00:54:37,900
He would do that
if you would just leave him alone.

646
00:54:39,068 --> 00:54:42,780
If you'd just leave him alone.
If you'd just leave him alone!

647
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:44,699
Leave him alone!

648
00:54:57,945 --> 00:55:00,798
Hey, listen, I'm sorry.
I called a few times. You didn't answer.

649
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:03,801
I didn't want to talk to your wife again.
That's why I didn't answer.

650
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:06,304
- Once was enough.
- Nola called? What did she say?

651
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:08,389
Look, I have to go.

652
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:14,979
Your life is just a little too complicated
for me right now.

653
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:18,107
I'll, uh... I'll see you
at the next open house.

654
00:56:20,336 --> 00:56:21,879
Daddy?

655
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:23,798
Oh, Candy.

656
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:28,386
What's the matter, sweetheart?
Why aren't you sleeping?

657
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:30,346
'Cause I had a bad dream.

658
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,348
A scary bad dream.

659
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:34,350
What was the dream about, honey?

660
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:37,561
- I'm afraid to tell you.
- Why?

661
00:56:37,645 --> 00:56:39,897
The dream doesn't want me to.

662
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,066
Candy, listen to me.

663
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:45,903
I know what happened at Grandma's.
I know what you saw there.

664
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:47,696
I just came from the police...

665
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:50,658
and, when I was there,
I saw the thing that hurt Grandma.

666
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:54,995
And, Candy, it's dead.

667
00:56:55,955 --> 00:56:57,623
I saw it lying on a table.

668
00:56:57,706 --> 00:57:00,876
And the police were there, and it's dead.

669
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,963
It can't hurt you now.

670
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:09,093
And it can't hurt me or anybody else.

671
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:11,804
Do you understand me?

672
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:13,931
It's dead?

673
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:15,516
Yes.

674
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:27,278
It's all right now, baby.

675
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:28,988
It's all right.

676
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:41,125
What do you think?

677
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:43,878
How many people do we have
at the main house?

678
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:45,921
Twenty-seven.

679
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:50,176
Okay, I want them out by this afternoon.

680
00:57:50,259 --> 00:57:51,760
And the house closed.

681
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:57,057
It'll be hard on them, Hal.
Especially Mike.

682
00:57:57,808 --> 00:58:00,311
Then do it gently.

683
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,438
But get them out.

684
00:58:03,898 --> 00:58:05,858
All right.

685
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:31,800
- Just put your suitcases in the compartment.
- I don't want to go.

686
00:58:31,884 --> 00:58:34,553
- I don't want to go.
- Michael, you have to go.

687
00:58:34,637 --> 00:58:36,722
- I just want you to get on the bus.
- No!

688
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:38,974
You'll see the doctor. Michael. Michael.

689
00:58:39,058 --> 00:58:41,268
- No. I don't want to go.
- Michael.

690
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:46,732
- Don't make me leave.
- I'm not making you leave.

691
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:49,735
Just be a good boy and get in the bus.
All right?

692
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:01,705
Hi, Jan.

693
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:03,207
Frank, hi.

694
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:07,211
Look, I think we got ourselves
a real live one.

695
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:10,297
Come on upstairs.
There's somebody I want you to meet.

696
00:59:16,453 --> 00:59:18,597
Is this the guy from Chicago?

697
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:20,975
Nope. Nope. No.

698
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:25,729
He's a - He's a local boy. Lives a lot
closer to home than you ever expected.

699
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:35,155
<i>- Hi. Sandra, I've been thinking that -
- Hello, Joe.</i>

700
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,334
Um, Trellan.

701
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:51,005
Mr. Carveth is here to see you.

702
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:54,592
Look who's here.

703
00:59:54,675 --> 00:59:56,343
Nola's old man.

704
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:59,430
The queen bee's favorite drone.

705
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:01,640
He's pretty far gone, huh?

706
01:00:01,724 --> 01:00:04,184
He'd be dynamite in court.

707
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:09,982
What did you mean when you said
Nola's the queen bee?

708
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:12,985
Oh, she's the queen bee, all right.

709
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:14,862
She's the star.

710
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:17,114
She's the one he's interested in.

711
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:20,117
And the rest of us don't count anymore.

712
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,329
She doesn't even have to pay for it.

713
01:00:23,412 --> 01:00:26,790
And that's because she's the one
who was born to prove...

714
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:28,542
that Psychoplasmics is -

715
01:00:28,626 --> 01:00:31,086
“the ultimate therapeutic device.”

716
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:32,389
That's a quote.

717
01:00:35,716 --> 01:00:38,677
Will you be my daddy?
He won't do it anymore.

718
01:00:38,761 --> 01:00:40,763
And my real daddy won't do it.

719
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:43,891
And that bastard, Dr. Raglan,
won't do it anymore.

720
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:49,563
You see, my real daddy
rejected me, and my -

721
01:00:49,647 --> 01:00:52,650
And my - my surrogate daddy
rejected me.

722
01:00:52,733 --> 01:00:55,069
That's just fuckin' wonderful.
Don't you think?

723
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:59,073
Calm down, Mike. Cool it
and tell him what happened at Somafree.

724
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,034
Look...

725
01:01:03,744 --> 01:01:06,622
I'll make a deal with you. Okay?

726
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:08,457
Just“

727
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:10,125
be my daddy.

728
01:01:10,209 --> 01:01:11,585
Please.

729
01:01:11,669 --> 01:01:13,545
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

730
01:01:13,629 --> 01:01:16,423
I'll bleed for you. Want me to bleed?

731
01:01:17,508 --> 01:01:20,052
No. That's silly, right?

732
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:23,138
It repulses you. I-I can see that.

733
01:01:23,222 --> 01:01:25,933
You're not into it. So why do it, right?

734
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:29,353
Besides...

735
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:32,314
nobody could do it like Dr. Raglan.

736
01:01:32,398 --> 01:01:34,400
Not even real Daddy.

737
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:37,444
And he knows it.

738
01:01:38,779 --> 01:01:42,116
Dr. Raglan knows I'm addicted to him...

739
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:44,576
and he doesn't care.

740
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,621
He's such a hard man.

741
01:01:49,123 --> 01:01:51,792
I was at that demonstration last Monday.

742
01:01:52,793 --> 01:01:56,171
You and Raglan seemed... very close.

743
01:01:56,255 --> 01:01:58,424
What happened?

744
01:01:58,507 --> 01:02:01,552
He threw us out, all of us.

745
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:03,345
Locked the door.

746
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:08,016
Yeah, it's true. I've been in touch
with some of the others.

747
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:12,062
They've all been thrown out of Somafree
and all therapy suspended.

748
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:16,775
All except for your wife.
She's still there.

749
01:02:19,528 --> 01:02:21,655
Doesn't anybody know why?

750
01:02:21,739 --> 01:02:24,616
Sure, somebody knows! <i>I</i> know!

751
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,326
He wants to be alone with her!

752
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:29,997
Dr. Raglan wants to be
alone with your wife.

753
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:33,936
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

754
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,222
Frank?

755
01:04:12,266 --> 01:04:14,726
- Hi, Frank.
- Oh, hi. Hi, Wendy.

756
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:22,568
Work quickly but quietly, children.

757
01:04:22,651 --> 01:04:26,530
Rebecca, wait until I hand out
these papers, please.

758
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:34,538
Teacher!

759
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:46,174
Rebecca, do you want to pass out
the blue papers, please?

760
01:04:46,258 --> 01:04:49,970
And, Clayton, how about you
pass out the purple ones?

761
01:04:52,264 --> 01:04:54,182
Okay, let's see.

762
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:56,768
How about this?

763
01:05:09,615 --> 01:05:11,617
- This person here?
- Yes.

764
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:27,966
Do the snowflakes too. That's a good idea.

765
01:05:29,176 --> 01:05:31,595
We'll do this larger. Is it...

766
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:44,650
Stop!

767
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:54,034
Help! No!

768
01:05:57,911 --> 01:05:58,872
Oh, my God!

769
01:06:07,089 --> 01:06:08,083
Help!

770
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:11,176
- What's the matter?
- They're hurting Miss Mayer!

771
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:13,780
They're hurting Miss Mayer!
The bad kids are hurting Miss Mayer!

772
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:16,682
The bad kids knocked her on the floor
and they're hitting her!

773
01:06:16,765 --> 01:06:19,805
They're hitting Miss Mayer! They made her
fall down! They made her fall down!

774
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:11,820
Candy!

775
01:07:13,488 --> 01:07:15,323
Candy!

776
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:23,123
Candy?

777
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:26,918
- Nola.
- Hmm?

778
01:07:27,002 --> 01:07:29,129
It's all right. It's Hal.

779
01:07:30,172 --> 01:07:32,049
Oh.

780
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:34,342
Hal, where's - Where is Chris?

781
01:07:34,426 --> 01:07:36,511
Chris usually wakes me up.

782
01:07:36,595 --> 01:07:39,514
Chris had to go into the city.

783
01:07:39,598 --> 01:07:41,475
- Mmm.
- You've been dreaming.

784
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:45,896
Yes, I was having a wonderful dream.

785
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:47,481
Wonderful.

786
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:51,359
And painful at the same time.

787
01:07:51,443 --> 01:07:54,696
My daughter was coming back to me.

788
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,323
And Frank.

789
01:07:57,157 --> 01:08:00,827
And Ruth Mayer-
was she in your dream?

790
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:05,123
Candy's teacher?

791
01:08:05,207 --> 01:08:07,209
I don't remember.

792
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:12,339
Then maybe we should talk about her.

793
01:08:13,507 --> 01:08:16,468
But I don't feel the need
to talk about her.

794
01:08:17,177 --> 01:08:20,514
You don't? Why not?

795
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,851
I don't know, Hal.

796
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:29,940
I think I must be
getting stronger because...

797
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:34,528
somehow, I just don't feel
threatened by her anymore.

798
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:48,375
Candice!

799
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,337
Candice!

800
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:10,730
This is where my wife and kid
lived for nine months...

801
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:13,525
before Nola moved out to Somafree.

802
01:09:14,408 --> 01:09:17,237
This is the first time I've seen the place.

803
01:09:19,406 --> 01:09:24,077
Frank, what are we doing here?
Tell me again.

804
01:09:26,661 --> 01:09:27,831
I don't know.

805
01:09:28,614 --> 01:09:30,917
I thought Candy might come back here.

806
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,720
No.

807
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:44,097
It's not a coincidence.

808
01:09:45,015 --> 01:09:47,267
Those things, those creatures...

809
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:50,812
they all disappeared together.

810
01:09:50,896 --> 01:09:52,939
They've got her.

811
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,900
<i>The best way to insulate
and finish your basement...</i>

812
01:11:14,104 --> 01:11:15,522
You gotta help me.

813
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:17,649
Somebody's following me.
Somebody's always following me.

814
01:11:17,732 --> 01:11:20,652
Did you find out anything?
Did you find out why they moved you out?

815
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:22,654
I gotta have something to eat. Anything.

816
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:24,948
I gotta have something to eat.
Anything.

817
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:28,118
What did you find out?
Why did they close Somafree down?

818
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:30,245
Talk to me now!

819
01:11:31,128 --> 01:11:33,623
Okay. Raglan's
onto something very, very big.

820
01:11:33,707 --> 01:11:35,625
Something to do with the kids.

821
01:11:35,709 --> 01:11:38,295
- He just got bored with the rest of us.
- Kids?

822
01:11:38,378 --> 01:11:40,297
What kids?

823
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:43,466
The disturbed kids in the work shed.

824
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:46,678
The ones your wife's taking care of.

825
01:13:56,433 --> 01:13:59,811
What have you done with my kid?
Where is she?

826
01:14:03,898 --> 01:14:06,901
Carveth, what the hell
are you talking about?

827
01:14:08,403 --> 01:14:10,113
They took her.

828
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:14,325
They killed Ruth Mayer,
and then they brought Candice back here.

829
01:14:29,007 --> 01:14:30,842
They killed Ruth Mayer?

830
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:34,262
Raglan, I want my daughter back.

831
01:14:35,013 --> 01:14:36,181
Now.

832
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:39,934
They bring her back here,
back to Nola?

833
01:14:40,018 --> 01:14:41,978
No, no.

834
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:44,647
If they brought her back here, then she'd -

835
01:14:44,731 --> 01:14:47,108
then she'd be up there in the attic.

836
01:14:47,192 --> 01:14:48,776
That's where they live.

837
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:59,078
Frank, I've got a gun.

838
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:04,417
They'll kill you...

839
01:15:04,501 --> 01:15:06,586
if you try to take her away from them.

840
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:11,257
Why?

841
01:15:11,341 --> 01:15:14,093
Because in a sense, she's one of them.

842
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:17,430
You're insane.

843
01:15:17,514 --> 01:15:19,557
Frank, they exist. You've seen them.

844
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:25,271
They're just freaks, deformed children.

845
01:15:25,355 --> 01:15:27,273
You've got Nola taking care of them.

846
01:15:27,357 --> 01:15:30,276
I'm sure she just loves
being their surrogate mother.

847
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:34,364
She's not their surrogate mother, Frank.

848
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:36,241
She's their real mother.

849
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:39,035
Their only mother.

850
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:42,664
Raglan, I'm not gonna listen.

851
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:45,083
They're her children, Frank.

852
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:48,127
More exactly,
they're the children of her rage.

853
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:50,129
They're motivated only by her anger...

854
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:53,967
whether that anger
is conscious or subconscious.

855
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:58,179
I mean, when - When Nola got cross
with Candy last weekend -

856
01:15:58,263 --> 01:16:00,223
annoyed really -

857
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:02,350
the brood beat her.

858
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:06,187
But when she released her rage
against her parents under therapy...

859
01:16:07,313 --> 01:16:08,982
then they killed them.

860
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:13,027
Now, I didn't want to believe that.

861
01:16:13,111 --> 01:16:15,029
But now they've killed Ruth Mayer.

862
01:16:15,113 --> 01:16:18,700
And they could kill you or me,
and she wouldn't even be aware of it.

863
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:22,287
I mean, she doesn't even
know that Candy's here.

864
01:16:25,832 --> 01:16:27,667
I want Candice back.

865
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:29,752
Then do it my way.

866
01:16:29,836 --> 01:16:33,339
Please. It's the right way.

867
01:16:35,425 --> 01:16:37,468
What do you want me to do?

868
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:40,930
I want you to go back into that hut...

869
01:16:41,014 --> 01:16:44,100
and persuade Nola
that you want her back...

870
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:46,603
that you want your family back.

871
01:16:46,686 --> 01:16:50,565
I want you to play the role
of apologetic lover and husband.

872
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:51,774
Why?

873
01:16:51,858 --> 01:16:54,986
Because if you can
keep Nola calm and happy...

874
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:57,488
then the brood's neutral.

875
01:16:57,572 --> 01:16:59,616
If she's mellow...

876
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:02,118
then I can just walk into that attic...

877
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:04,912
pick up Candy,
tuck her under my arm and walk out.

878
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:07,540
Now, can you do that?

879
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:12,045
I don't know.

880
01:17:13,254 --> 01:17:15,882
Frank, if things go wrong...

881
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:19,093
if Nola gets angry, if the kids get angry -

882
01:17:21,346 --> 01:17:23,514
You understand?

883
01:17:23,598 --> 01:17:26,684
I'm not going to be the only one
to pay for that anger.

884
01:17:26,768 --> 01:17:29,062
Raglan, I don't trust you.

885
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:33,941
What does it matter?

886
01:17:35,109 --> 01:17:38,112
I'll move up there
30 seconds after you're in.

887
01:17:47,497 --> 01:17:49,248
Frank, be nice to her.

888
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:27,537
Hal?

889
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:32,458
It's me, Nola. It's Frank.

890
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:38,172
Frank?

891
01:18:38,256 --> 01:18:40,550
Am I dreaming?

892
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:44,470
I thought you said you weren't going
to come and see me while I was here.

893
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:50,309
Well, I think that was a misunderstanding.

894
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:57,191
That's why I'm here.

895
01:18:58,818 --> 01:19:01,320
I want us to understand each other.

896
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:46,324
You're the only woman in the world for me.

897
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:49,160
You always have been. You always will be.

898
01:19:50,161 --> 01:19:52,288
That won't ever change.

899
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:55,458
I want you to know that.

900
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:59,587
I wish it were true.
God, I wish it were true.

901
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:30,827
We've lost touch.

902
01:20:32,245 --> 01:20:35,748
That's the only reason
all this ever happened.

903
01:20:35,832 --> 01:20:39,919
All we have to do is make sure
we don't lose touch again.

904
01:20:41,254 --> 01:20:44,257
Isolation is part of my therapy, Frank.

905
01:20:46,133 --> 01:20:50,012
What's been happening to me
has been just too strange -

906
01:20:50,096 --> 01:20:55,059
too strange for me to share
with anyone from my old life.

907
01:20:56,269 --> 01:20:59,605
Then make me a part of your new life.

908
01:20:59,689 --> 01:21:01,732
Let me be part of it.

909
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,695
Show me, educate me, involve me.

910
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:09,782
I'm ready now.
I wasn't before, but I'm ready now.

911
01:21:19,959 --> 01:21:21,794
Candy.

912
01:21:27,008 --> 01:21:29,594
Are you ready for me, Frank?

913
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:33,055
Are you really?

914
01:21:34,849 --> 01:21:37,894
I seem to be a very special person.

915
01:21:37,977 --> 01:21:41,314
I'm in the middle of a strange adventure.

916
01:21:43,149 --> 01:21:45,151
Let me be with you.

917
01:21:46,527 --> 01:21:49,322
I want to go with you wherever you go.

918
01:21:50,281 --> 01:21:51,824
Do you?

919
01:21:55,244 --> 01:21:56,787
Do you?

920
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:00,333
Yes.

921
01:22:01,459 --> 01:22:03,711
Then look.

922
01:22:33,074 --> 01:22:34,101
Candy?

923
01:22:39,622 --> 01:22:41,165
Candy?

924
01:22:45,252 --> 01:22:47,463
Daddy?

925
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:50,549
Is it time to go to school yet?

926
01:22:51,217 --> 01:22:53,552
No, sweetheart.

927
01:22:53,636 --> 01:22:55,680
It's Dr. Hal.

928
01:22:55,763 --> 01:22:58,975
Your daddy's downstairs talking to Mummy.

929
01:22:59,058 --> 01:23:01,102
He wants to see you.

930
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,802
Oh, God, Nola.

931
01:24:18,763 --> 01:24:22,141
No. I disgust you.

932
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:26,896
I sicken you.

933
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:29,190
You <i>hate</i> me.

934
01:24:31,317 --> 01:24:34,236
You didn't come here because you love me.

935
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:38,115
You came here to take our daughter away
and give her to somebody else.

936
01:24:42,328 --> 01:24:44,413
I wouldn't do that.

937
01:24:44,497 --> 01:24:46,499
I wouldn't do that to you.

938
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:54,590
Candy.

939
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:56,592
You go out of that door.

940
01:24:56,675 --> 01:24:58,427
You find your daddy.

941
01:25:03,224 --> 01:25:05,059
You liar.

942
01:25:05,142 --> 01:25:07,019
You're lying.

943
01:25:08,187 --> 01:25:10,564
You're lying! You're lying!

944
01:25:10,648 --> 01:25:12,108
I know!

945
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:57,236
I know you so well.

946
01:25:57,319 --> 01:25:59,822
And it won't work. It won't work.

947
01:26:01,407 --> 01:26:05,035
I'd kill Candice before I'd let you
take her away from me.

948
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:07,413
Do you hear me?

949
01:26:08,372 --> 01:26:11,709
I'd kill Candice
before I'd let you take her!

950
01:26:48,996 --> 01:26:50,497
Make them stop.

951
01:26:59,298 --> 01:27:02,384
They're doing what you want them to do!

952
01:27:07,306 --> 01:27:09,308
You want them to kill Candice.

953
01:27:13,395 --> 01:27:16,273
You make them stop, or I'll kill <i>you!</i>

954
01:27:16,357 --> 01:27:17,900
Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!

955
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:20,194
Kill me! Kill me!

956
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:50,594
