         WE COULD JUST
      GO BACK TO THE CAR.

      - I MET SOMEBODY...

552
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:44,140
    AND HE'S QUITE A CATCH.

553
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:47,310
HE'S REALLY A GREAT GUY.

554
00:25:47,378 --> 00:25:50,847
    AND I'M HAPPY...REALLY.

        plays on radio]

556
00:25:55,169 --> 00:25:58,388
    - COME TO MAMA, SUGAR!

557
00:25:58,472 --> 00:26:00,473
         - HEY, MAMA.

558
00:26:00,524 --> 00:26:02,642
      - OH, GOOD LAND OF
          THE LIVIN',

559
00:26:02,693 --> 00:26:06,312
    YOU ARE SKIN AND BONES.

560
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,698
  WELL, DON'T I GET A SMILE?

561
00:26:08,783 --> 00:26:10,650
      I KNOW YOU GOT ONE
      IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

562
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:13,870
 - COME ON, COME ON, LET'S NOT
  LET ALL THE BOUGHT AIR OUT.

563

    - WELL, ARE YOU HUNGRY,
        SWEETIE?

564
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,581
 DO YOU WANT ME TO REHEAT YOU
SOME CHICKEN-FRIED STEAK?

565
00:26:24,665 --> 00:26:25,949
- OH, NO, MAMA, I'M FINE.

566
00:26:26,016 --> 00:26:28,134
  - SWEETIE, YOU LOOK TIRED.

567
00:26:28,202 --> 00:26:30,170
        ARE YOU TIRED?
      OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

568
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:33,339
      MAYBE IT'S THE WAY
 YOU'RE WEARING YOUR HAIR NOW.

569
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:37,477
  - YOU GUYS HAVE REALLY DONE
     A LOT WITH THE PLACE.

570
00:26:37,544 --> 00:26:39,512
- LORD, WOULD YOU LISTEN
        TO THAT ACCENT?

571
00:26:39,563 --> 00:26:41,481
- HEY, WHY DON'T YOU SIT
    IN MY GOOD CHAIR?

572
00:26:41,548 --> 00:26:43,349
  NOW, YOUR MAMA GOT ME THIS
    CHRISTMAS BEFORE LAST.

573
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:44,884
    - OH, YOU MEAN THE ONE
        WHERE YOU GUYS

574
00:26:44,935 --> 00:26:46,319
    WERE SUPPOSED TO
        COME VISIT ME?

575
00:26:46,386 --> 00:26:47,771
         - I TOLD YOU
     TIME AND TIME AGAIN,

576
00:26:47,855 --> 00:26:49,722
     IT JUST DIDN'T SUIT.

577
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,108
        LET ME--LET ME
    GET YOU THOSE TICKETS.

578
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:57,730
    - SIT DOWN IN IT.
        SIT DOWN.

579
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,735
        NOW WATCH THIS.

580
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,789
             - OH!

581
00:27:05,873 --> 00:27:07,957
     - I MEAN, ISN'T THAT
        QUITE THE DEAL?

582
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:09,959
- THERE ARE HARDLY WORDS.

583
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:11,628
    NOW HOW DO I GET
      OUT OF THIS THING?

584
00:27:11,712 --> 00:27:13,680
             - OH.

585
00:27:13,747 --> 00:27:15,849
    - [grunts] OH, MY GOD!

586
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:18,417
        - JAKE TELL YOU
 HE'S THINKIN' OF GETTIN' ONE?

587
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:21,438
 - OH, I SEE YOUR PRIORITIES.

588
00:27:21,522 --> 00:27:23,273
  JAKE, JAIL, AND THEN HOME.

589
00:27:23,357 --> 00:27:25,925
- MAMA, IT WAS JUST UNFINISHED
    BUSINESS, IS ALL.

590
00:27:25,993 --> 00:27:29,195
- JAKE'S DOIN' ALL RIGHT.
      BOY'S GOIN' PLACES.

591
00:27:29,263 --> 00:27:31,264
      - ONCE UPON A TIME,
  YOU WERE GOIN' PLACES TOO.

592
00:27:31,315 --> 00:27:34,117
    HERE ARE YOUR TICKETS.

593
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:36,269
     - THESE WERE A GIFT.

594
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,771
      I'D RATHER YOU GUYS
        JUST USE THEM.

595
00:27:42,376 --> 00:27:43,576
        YOU KNOW
    WHAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND

596
00:27:43,627 --> 00:27:44,994
    IS HOW Y'ALL WILL VISIT

597
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:47,547
EVERY STUPID BATTLEFIELD
IN THE CONTINENTAL U.S.,

598
00:27:47,614 --> 00:27:50,166
     BUT YOU CAN'T MANAGE
 TO VISIT YOUR ONLY DAUGHTER.

599
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,652
    - WELL, THE DOOR SWINGS
      BOTH WAYS, SWEETIE.

600
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,472
ANYWAY, DON'T GET ME STARTED ON
THE THINGS I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

601
00:27:55,556 --> 00:27:56,756
         - HERE WE GO.
- MAMA, YOUR DREAM FOR ME

602
00:27:56,807 --> 00:27:58,641
        WAS TO GET OUT
OF THIS PLACE AND BE SOMEBODY.

603
00:27:58,726 --> 00:28:00,459
THAT'S WHY YOU SHOVED ME
    IN EVERY BEAUTY PAGEANT

604
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:01,895
         IN THE STATE.

605
00:28:01,962 --> 00:28:03,513
  - I'M JUST SAYIN', IS ALL.

606
00:28:03,597 --> 00:28:05,932
     - WHAT?! WHAT ARE YOU
        TRYING TO SAY?!

607
00:28:05,983 --> 00:28:08,318
I MEAN, JUST TELL ME WHAT
  I CAN DO TO MAKE YOU HAPPY!

608
00:28:08,402 --> 00:28:09,969
  - JUST MAKE YOURSELF HAPPY,
        DARLIN'.

609
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,689
            - DONE.
    WE'RE THERE, ALL RIGHT?

610
00:28:12,756 --> 00:28:14,741
     YOU KNOW, I'VE REALLY
MADE SOMETHING OF MYSELF.

611
00:28:14,808 --> 00:28:17,476
    I HAVE A CAREER.
PEOPLE ACTUALLY WANT TO BE ME.

612
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:20,530
    AND SOMEBODY LOVES ME,
        AND I LOVE HIM.

613
00:28:26,153 --> 00:28:28,621
 - PEARL, WHY DON'T YOU GET US
SOME OF THAT BALONEY CAKE

614
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:31,374
        OUT THE ICEBOX?

615
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:39,599
 YOUR MAMA'S A COMPLEX WOMAN.

616
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:41,834
      - I'M GOING TO BED.

617
00:28:45,656 --> 00:28:47,640
    - GOOD NIGHT, DARLIN'.

618
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,314
    - BUT YOU KNOW NOTHING
          ABOUT HER.

619
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,482
 ARE YOU EVEN SURE WHO SHE IS?

620
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,984
      - I LOVE HER, MOM.

621
00:28:58,035 --> 00:28:59,569
        - THAT'S NICE,
  BUT YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.

622
00:28:59,653 --> 00:29:01,287
YOU AND I ARE DIFFERENT.

623
00:29:01,355 --> 00:29:02,906
    WE'RE NOT BETTER,
    WE'RE NOT WORSE.

624
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,357
     WE'RE JUST DIFFERENT.

625
00:29:04,408 --> 00:29:05,708
     WE'RE IN PUBLIC LIFE
        TO SERVE,

626
00:29:05,793 --> 00:29:07,260
         AND TO SERVE
 TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITIES,

627
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,128
 WE HAVE TO SET GOOD EXAMPLES.

628
00:29:09,196 --> 00:29:10,914
- DO YOU HAVE TO CONTROL
          EVERYTHING?

629
00:29:10,981 --> 00:29:12,332
      - TELL HER I'VE PUT
      A HOLD ON THE PLAZA

630
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:13,833
    FOR THE SECOND WEEKEND
        IN JUNE.

631
00:29:13,884 --> 00:29:15,301
     THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU
A NICE, LONG ENGAGEMENT.

632
00:29:15,369 --> 00:29:18,421
 - WE WERE THINKING CHRISTMAS
          IN IRELAND.

633
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:22,725
        - IF YOU THINK
  I'M GOING TO LET SOME GIRL

634
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,394
         TALK YOU INTO
      GETTING MARRIED...

635
00:29:24,478 --> 00:29:25,678
- SHE IS NOT "SOME GIRL."

636
00:29:25,729 --> 00:29:27,046
          - ANY PLACE
     BUT NEW YORK CITY...

637
00:29:27,097 --> 00:29:28,982
      - SHE'S MY FIANCEE,
      FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

638
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:31,935
          - [laughs]

639
00:29:32,002 --> 00:29:34,237
YOU ARE JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER.

640
00:29:34,321 --> 00:29:37,323
 ONE MINUTE YOU'RE BRILLIANT,

641
00:29:37,391 --> 00:29:39,576
    CONTROLLED, STEADFAST.

642
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,110
        THE NEXT YOU'RE
     THROWING IT ALL AWAY

643
00:29:41,195 --> 00:29:44,998
  ON SOME YOUNG PIECE OF ASS.

644
00:29:45,065 --> 00:29:46,916
- THOSE ARE YOUR ISSUES,
            MOTHER.

645
00:29:47,001 --> 00:29:48,901
        NOT MINE.

646
00:29:57,244 --> 00:29:59,262
            - OKAY.

647
00:29:59,346 --> 00:30:02,465
        HOLD ON.

648
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:04,884
        YOU KNOW WHAT?
             UH...

649
00:30:04,935 --> 00:30:07,586
         HOW LONG DOES
A CONTESTED DIVORCE TAKE?

650
00:30:07,638 --> 00:30:10,306
          18 MONTHS?!

651
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,259
          MR. BUFORD,
    I DON'T HAVE 18 MONTHS.

652
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,094
     I DON'T HAVE 18 DAYS.

653
00:30:15,145 --> 00:30:17,981
    OKAY, WELL, THAT'S JUST
    NOT GONNA WORK FOR ME.

654
00:30:18,065 --> 00:30:20,316
         - WHOO-WHEE!
        - Y-YEAH--YES.

655
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:23,269
 - DON'T SEE THE LIKES OF YOU
 AROUND THESE HERE PARTS MUCH!

656
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,154
         - MR. BUFORD,
    THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

657
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:28,441
     - LADY, YOU LOOK LIKE
        SEX ON A STICK

658
00:30:28,492 --> 00:30:30,293
IN THAT FREDERICK MONTANA GETUP!
  - I HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK.

659
00:30:30,377 --> 00:30:33,496
        LISTEN, BUBBA,
 WHY DON'T YOU JUST KISS MY...

660
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,780
             ASS!

661
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:36,449
          OH, MY GOD!

662
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,117
  - GET IN THE TRUCK, THERE,
            MISSY,

663
00:30:38,185 --> 00:30:42,138
  'CAUSE I DON'T DO THAT SORT
    OF THING ON THE STREET.

664
00:30:42,222 --> 00:30:44,123
      - I GUESS YOUR MAMA
    RAISED YOU RIGHT.

665
00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:47,626
     - WHOO! WHAT IS THAT?
CALVIN KLEIN? THAT'S VERY NICE.

666
00:30:47,678 --> 00:30:50,813
         - VERY GOOD.
      I BETTER BACK OFF.

667
00:30:50,881 --> 00:30:53,650
DON'T WANT TO GET YOU IN TROUBLE
     WITH THE LITTLE LADY.

668
00:30:53,734 --> 00:30:55,435
    THERE IS A LITTLE LADY,
         ISN'T THERE?

669
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,470
          - AH, HELL,
    I CAN HARDLY AFFORD ME,

670
00:30:57,521 --> 00:30:59,339
        MUCH LESS
  SOME HIGH-MAINTENANCE BABE.

671
00:30:59,406 --> 00:31:00,806
         - WHAT ABOUT
    CINDY WHAT'S-HER-NAME?

672
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,241
    YOU GUYS WERE REAL HOT
AND HEAVY IN HIGH SCHOOL.

673
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:03,609
     WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

674
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:05,478
- SHE'S A WOMEN'S SOFTBALL COACH
    UP IN NASHVILLE.

675
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:06,496
            MM-HMM.

676
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,947
          [chuckles]

677
00:31:07,998 --> 00:31:10,183
     - WELL, THAT EXPLAINS
SOME LINGERING QUESTIONS

678
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,168
    THAT I HAD ABOUT A GAME
        OF POST OFFICE

679
00:31:12,252 --> 00:31:13,786
      WE PLAYED ONE TIME.

680
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:16,655
             - NO!
        [both laughing]

681
00:31:16,707 --> 00:31:18,324
     - I GUESS WE ALL HAVE
      OUR LITTLE SECRETS,

682
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:20,626
     DON'T WE, BOBBY RAY?

683
00:31:20,694 --> 00:31:23,212
      - YEAH, WE SURE DO.

684
00:31:25,132 --> 00:31:27,833
  'COURSE, I READ ABOUT YOURS
    ON THE INTERNET.

685
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:29,218
        - WHAT?!

686
00:31:29,303 --> 00:31:31,437
    - OH, I KNOW ALL ABOUT
  THE COCKS IN YOUR HENHOUSE.

687
00:31:31,505 --> 00:31:34,057
          - OH, GOD!
          BOBBY RAY!

00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:31,680
I'M NOT REALLY A WATCH-AND-SEE

    YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED
        TO LEARN

  DO YOU REMEMBER THAT, MEL?
     - HOW COULD I FORGET?

956
00:43:58,017 --> 00:44:00,552
      THAT WAS THE NIGHT

         AN ADVENTURE.

1347
01:07:39,671 --> 01:07:41,906

- LOCAL HERO AROUND HERE.

1458
01:13:56,881 --> 01:13:58,799
        - WHY IS THAT?

1459
01:13:58,883 --> 01:14:01,018
    - SHE BLEW UP THE BANK.

1460
01:14:01,085 --> 01:14:03,270
  - AND THAT MADE HER A HERO?

1461
01:14:03,354 --> 01:14:06,723
  - WELL, NOTORIOUS, ANYWAY.
         SHE WAS TEN.

      NOBODY WAS HURT...

1464
01:14:10,695 --> 01:14:13,146
    EXCEPT, MAYBE, THE CAT.

1465
01:14:13,231 --> 01:14:14,781
          - WHAT CAT?

1466
01:14:14,866 --> 01:14:18,368
  - THE ONE WITH THE DYNAMITE
         ON ITS BACK.

1467
01:14:18,436 --> 01:14:19,903
     - SHE BLEW UP A CAT?

1468
01:14:19,954 --> 01:14:21,455
- HE WAS SCHEDULED TO DIE
            ANYWAY.

1469
01:14:21,539 --> 01:14:22,456
    - FROM DYNAMITE?

1470
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:25,075
 - THE VET SAID IT HAD CANCER,

1471
01:14:25,126 --> 01:14:28,545
SO ELDON THOUGHT IT'D BE PUT IN
    ONE OF THOSE CHAMBERS,

1472
01:14:28,612 --> 01:14:31,131
 YOU KNOW, THE ONES THAT SUCK
    THEIR LUNGS OUT.

1473
01:14:31,215 --> 01:14:33,616
 LITTLE MEL, SHE COULDN'T BEAR
     THE THOUGHT OF THAT.

1474
01:14:33,668 --> 01:14:36,720
 SHE, UH, SHE WANTED SOMETHIN'
         MORE HUMANE.

1475
01:14:36,787 --> 01:14:38,755
         - YEAH, SURE.

1476
01:14:38,806 --> 01:14:41,508
- SO THEY WERE DOIN' SOME
BLASTIN' OUT BY THE NEW HIGHWAY.

1477
01:14:41,592 --> 01:14:46,096
SO WE, UH, WE TOOK OLD FUZZ UP
     THERE, TAPED HIM UP.

1478
01:14:46,147 --> 01:14:48,598
USED ABOUT, I DON'T KNOW,
        30 FEET OF FUSE

1479
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,067
 JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE,

1480
01:14:50,134 --> 01:14:52,019
    SAID OUR PRAYERS,
      AND RAN LIKE HELL.

1481
01:14:52,103 --> 01:14:53,403
         - OF COURSE.

1482
01:14:53,471 --> 01:14:56,573
- SO THERE WE WERE, SITTIN' IN
        VIRGIE'S DINER,

1483
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,325
     FEELIN' PRETTY BLUE,

1484
01:14:58,409 --> 01:15:01,161
    WHEN MEL LOOKS UP
    AND SEES THAT DAMN CAT

1485
01:15:01,245 --> 01:15:04,164
    TROTTIN' DOWN THE ROAD,
     SEARCHIN' FOR ELDON.

1486
01:15:04,248 --> 01:15:05,415
          - NO SHIT.

1487
01:15:05,483 --> 01:15:07,250
- YEAH, AND WE WOULD HAVE
        CAUGHT HIM TOO,

1488
01:15:07,318 --> 01:15:09,819
      BUT ONCE THAT FUSE
         HIT HIS TAIL,

1489
01:15:09,871 --> 01:15:10,871
    BOOM, HE TOOK OFF
         LIKE A SHOT.

1490
01:15:10,955 --> 01:15:12,989
     - AND INTO THE BANK.

1491
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:14,458
        - WELL...

1492
01:15:14,509 --> 01:15:16,043
  THE THEORY IS, HE PROBABLY
        WRIGGLED LOOSE

1493
01:15:16,127 --> 01:15:17,461
      FROM THE EXPLOSIVE,

1494
01:15:17,512 --> 01:15:20,547
'CAUSE, UH, PEOPLE STILL SEE HIM
      FROM TIME TO TIME,

1495

1496
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:27,020
    HE'S A LITTLE SKITTISH
        AROUND HUMANS.

1497
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:28,772
    - THAT'S QUITE A STORY.

1498
01:15:28,839 --> 01:15:33,343
    - SHE WAS QUITE A GIRL.

1499
01:15:33,394 --> 01:15:36,613
  - WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HER?

1500
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:39,116
        - OH, YOU KNOW,

    - YOU AND I ARE IN LOVE
  WITH TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

1514
01:16:46,384 --> 01:16:49,386
- IS HE A SECOND COUSIN?

1515
01:16:49,437 --> 01:16:51,104
      - HE'S MY HUSBAND.

1516
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:52,305
         - YOUR WHAT?

1517
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:53,807
    - I MEAN MY EX-HUSBAND.

1518
01:16:53,891 --> 01:16:55,058
  - YOU MARRIED YOUR COUSIN?

1519
01:16:55,109 --> 01:16:57,310
    - NO, I CAME DOWN HERE
    TO FINALIZE MY DIVORCE.

1520
01:16:57,395 --> 01:16:58,528
- JESUS CHRIST, MELANIE.

1521
01:16:58,596 --> 01:17:03,200
        - HEY, DARLIN',
     THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU.

1522
01:17:03,267 --> 01:17:06,319
MUST BE YOUR NEW SOMEONE.

    GLAD TO MEET YA.

      - MELANIE SMOOTER.

1525
01:17:17,114 --> 01:17:18,548
        - ANDREW, WAIT.

1526
01:17:18,616 --> 01:17:20,133
             WAIT.

1527

            PLEASE!

1531
01:17:24,839 --> 01:17:27,057
LET ME TRY AND EXPLAIN MYSELF!

1532

     YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!

1533
01:17:29,227 --> 01:17:30,960
 THIS IS NOT WHO I AM ANYMORE!

1534
01:17:31,012 --> 01:17:33,296
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE
 OR WHAT ELSE YOU LIED ABOUT,

1535
01:17:33,347 --> 01:17:34,514
     BUT I KNOW ONE THING,

1536
01:17:34,599 --> 01:17:38,185
THERE IS A LEAR JET IN MOBILE,
        AND I AM ON IT.

1537
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:03,710
- I KNOW YOU'RE THINKIN'
I SPOILED THINGS GOOD THIS TIME.

1538
01:18:03,794 --> 01:18:07,297
- OH, HON, DON'T GO ACCUSIN' ME
         OF THINKIN'.

1539
01:18:07,348 --> 01:18:10,467
     I AIN'T DONE ANYTHING
         OF THE SORT.

1540
01:18:10,518 --> 01:18:15,171
 ANYWAY, SPOILED'S IN THE EYE
    OF THE BEHOLDER.

1541
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:17,190
    LIKE THESE PLUMS HERE,

1542
01:18:17,275 --> 01:18:20,310
  SOME PEOPLE MIGHT CALL THEM
            SPOILED

1543
01:18:20,361 --> 01:18:25,232
  BUT I THINK THAT, UM, THESE
     ALMOST-RUINED ONES...

1544
01:18:25,316 --> 01:18:29,236
        SOMETIMES MAKE
    THE SWEETEST JAM.

1545
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,071
    - DO YOU NEED ANY HELP?

1546
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:35,242
      IT WAS KIND OF FUN,

1547
01:18:35,326 --> 01:18:37,878
    SEEIN' DADDY UP THERE,
         SURRENDERING.

1548
01:18:37,962 --> 01:18:42,632
- YEAH, HE SURE DOES HAVE
A FLAIR FOR THE DRAMATIC.

1549
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:45,752
  YOU CERTAINLY DON'T GET IT
  FROM MY SIDE OF THE FAMILY.

1550
01:18:48,005 --> 01:18:49,389
         - HEY, Y'ALL.

1551
01:18:49,473 --> 01:18:52,208
    LOOK WHO I FOUND
      WALKIN' DOWN I-58.

1552
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:55,011

1553
01:18:55,062 --> 01:18:59,065
             - HI.

1554
01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:03,236
  I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HALFWAY
      TO NEW YORK BY NOW.

1555
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:05,989
          - SO DID I.

1556
01:19:06,056 --> 01:19:08,408
  - OOH, IF I'D KNOWN COMPANY
          WAS COMIN',

1557
01:19:08,492 --> 01:19:11,895
I'D HAVE PUT ON THE DOG.

1558
01:19:11,963 --> 01:19:15,916
      - THIS IS MY MAMA.

1559
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,118
    SHE MAKES THE BEST JAM
      IN THREE COUNTIES.

1560
01:19:18,202 --> 01:19:20,537
          - OH, NOW.

1561
01:19:20,588 --> 01:19:21,705
     - AND MY DADDY, YOU--

1562
01:19:21,756 --> 01:19:25,908
     YOU ALREADY MET HIM.

1563
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:29,746
     AND THIS IS OUR HOME.

1564
01:19:29,797 --> 01:19:32,682
THIS IS WHERE I GREW UP.

1565
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:35,652
    - WELL, IT'S A PLEASURE
    MEETING YOU BOTH.

            WELL...

1569
01:19:41,392 --> 01:19:44,461
          THAT IS IF
     SHE'LL STILL HAVE ME.

1570
01:19:50,284 --> 01:19:53,603
          LOOK, MEL.

1571
01:19:53,654 --> 01:19:56,239
      I REALLY DON'T CARE
WHAT HAPPENED DOWN HERE.

1572
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:59,209
      SO YOU HAVE A PAST.

1573
01:19:59,276 --> 01:20:01,411
     I MEAN, WHO DOESN'T?

1574
01:20:06,417 --> 01:20:09,753
      WHAT I NEED TO KNOW
 IS IF THERE IS A PLACE FOR ME

1575
01:20:09,804 --> 01:20:12,122
        IN YOUR FUTURE.

1576
01:20:12,189 --> 01:20:16,259
    - OH, GOOD LORD.
  THAT IS THE SWEETEST THING.

1577
01:20:18,029 --> 01:20:20,397
         WELL, GO ON.

1578

              OH!
     HELLO, NEW YORK CITY.

      YOU GASSIN' ABOUT?

1580
01:20:31,242 --> 01:20:33,777
        - WELL, SIR...

1581
01:20:33,828 --> 01:20:36,413
    MY MOTHER HAPPENS TO BE
 THE MAYOR UP THERE, AND, UH,

1582
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,165
SHE'D LIKE NOTHING BETTER
          THAN A BIG,

1583
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:43,453
SNAZZY NEW YORK WEDDING.

1584
01:20:43,504 --> 01:20:47,207
  - WELL, UH, YEAH, I SUPPOSE
     I CAN TAKE OFF WORK.

1585
01:20:49,827 --> 01:20:52,128
    - ANDREW, I, UM,

1586
01:20:52,179 --> 01:20:53,546
ACTUALLY, I WAS THINKING
        MAYBE WE COULD

1587
01:20:53,631 --> 01:20:57,834
    HAVE THE WEDDING HERE.

1588
01:20:57,885 --> 01:20:59,185
            - HERE.

1589
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:02,355
    - IN MY HOMETOWN.

1590
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,507
- LOOK, MEL, IF YOU'RE WORRIED
    ABOUT THE MONEY, DON'T.

1591
01:21:04,558 --> 01:21:06,893
  - IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY,
        ANDREW...

01:21:06,977 --> 01:21:11,865
        NOT DOWN HERE.

1593
01:21:11,949 --> 01:21:14,901
  - YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE
    ARE EXPECTING US

1594
01:21:14,985 --> 01:21:17,353
  TO GET MARRIED IN THE CITY,

1595
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:20,323
  BUT I THINK A NICE, QUIET,
        COUNTRY WEDDING

1596

      IS JUST THE TICKET.

1597
01:21:22,993 --> 01:21:25,829
     EARL, PEARL, IF YOU--

1598
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:29,365
IF YOU FOLKS COULD TAKE CARE OF
     THE REHEARSAL DINNER,

1599
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:33,202
 I'D REALLY LIKE TO TAKE CARE
         OF THE REST.

1600
01:21:33,254 --> 01:21:36,673
- WELL, I THINK WE COULD
          COVER THAT.

1601
01:21:36,724 --> 01:21:39,476
  - HECK, HOW MANY TIMES DOES

1602
01:21:39,543 --> 01:21:41,061
      YOUR ONLY DAUGHTER
         GET MARRIED?

1603
01:21:46,016 --> 01:21:49,385
      OTHER THAN BEFORE.

1604
01:21:49,437 --> 01:21:52,355
    - FELONY MELANIE?
  - SHE WAS NEVER CONVICTED.

01:21:55,242 --> 01:21:57,894
    CHILD CAT KILLER
  OR SONS OF THE CONFEDERACY.

1607
01:21:57,945 --> 01:22:01,331
- WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST I DO,
 MOM, DUMP HER FOR BEING POOR?

1608
01:22:01,398 --> 01:22:03,065
     YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
     A DEMOCRAT, REMEMBER?

1609
01:22:03,117 --> 01:22:04,918
- THERE IS NOTHING WRONG
    WITH BEING POOR.

1610
01:22:05,002 --> 01:22:08,404
 I GET ELECTED BY POOR PEOPLE,
  AND I'M A BIG ENOUGH PERSON

1611
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:10,673
TO COMMEND HER FOR MAKING
     SOMETHING OF HERSELF.

1612
01:22:10,741 --> 01:22:12,792
        WHAT UPSETS ME
IS THAT SHE LIED TO YOU.

1613
01:22:12,877 --> 01:22:13,927
          - SO WHAT?

1614
01:22:14,011 --> 01:22:15,345
        SHE WAS ASHAMED
      OF HER BACKGROUND.

1615
01:22:15,412 --> 01:22:16,629
    I MEAN, WHO HASN'T BEEN
          EMBARRASSED

1616
01:22:16,714 --> 01:22:19,015
 BY THEIR PARENTS AT ONE POINT
          OR ANOTHER?

1617
01:22:19,082 --> 01:22:21,601
- I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT WAS
    A RHETORICAL QUESTION.

1618
01:22:21,685 --> 01:22:26,055
        - ASSUME AWAY.

1619
01:22:26,107 --> 01:22:28,057
NO ONE IS GOING TO CHANGE
      MY MIND ABOUT THIS,

1620
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:30,944
    NOT YOU, NOT THE MEDIA,
          NOT ANYONE.

1621
01:22:31,028 --> 01:22:33,780
            - FINE.

1622
01:22:33,864 --> 01:22:36,783
         BUT ADMIT IT,
         I WAS RIGHT.

1623
01:22:36,867 --> 01:22:40,102
    - YES, YOU WERE RIGHT.

1624
01:22:40,154 --> 01:22:41,738
      BUT SHE CAME CLEAN,
      NOW CAN WE MOVE ON?

1625

      THERE IS A WEDDING
        IN YOUR FUTURE,

1634
01:23:02,459 --> 01:23:04,344

    BUT IF THIS GETS OUT--

1635
01:23:04,428 --> 01:23:05,895
          - IT WON'T.

     - BECAUSE I HESITATED
    LONG ENOUGH TO REALIZE
