- Gosh, you can <i>see</i> it. You look glowing.
- You look really dark.

159
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,371
Girls, I might just pack
up and move there.

- What? Where?
- Where did you go?

161
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:08,293
It's this tiny little oasis
on the coast of Florida.

162
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:12,005
It's people like us, mid-lifers
who still like to strut past the pool

163
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:16,259
and stop the party dead in its
tracks with a tube top and full jewelry.

A soul-douche? Well...

167
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:26,769
And not that I was looking, but there
are so many gorgeous men there.

We're talking Tommy
Bahama from head to toe.

169

Tommy Bahama.

Put that with a 24-hour CVS

I was really hoping to talk
this week about horses.

193

Specifically my horse, and
the spectacular time we had...

You know the rules, Delores.

We only share about the topic
that we pick out of the talking jar.

Give me your soup.

jobs.

199

I wanted to talk about my
job at the Christmas store.

200

I know everyone thinks
it's not busy right now,

- I believe you.
- Thank you.

Well, I love my job at the pharmacy.

204
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,846
I get to play with the pills,

205
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,849
and sometimes I shake
them along to the music.

Star, we can't tell the
ladies what happened today.

apart with character socks.

I mean, you guys work at

Maybe socks would be a good topic.

Oh, yes. I love the socks without ankles.

So, we had a lot of... Big delivery.

- One big delivery.
- With furniture.

- And sofa.
- Tables.

228
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:22,737
There was a guy.

- The other was shorter.
- Not as tall.

- We filled out paperwork.
- Inventory.

Did everything.

233

Barb, men are not attracted to

think of Kermit riding his bicycle

legs. He really needed them.

- Yeah.

Oh, I wasn't thinking about
him anymore. I forgot him.

forgot all about him.

Sit on the patio and
practice my calligraphy.

Maybe write a poem.

845
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:12,149
And just have a couple of
Wheat Thins, and just cool it.

Oh, that's a nice idea.

Hi.

894
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:51,684
I've been thinking about
you ever since this morning.

895
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,067
- Shall I come in?
- Uh... no, no, no.

- Wait. Sorry. Um...
- Oh.

897
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,279
I got like work stuff
everywhere. It's a real mess.

898
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,531
That's okay. I only have
a few minutes anyways.

899
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,408
- Star thinks I'm in the tub.
- No, no. Wait, wait.

900
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,410
Um, not here. Not
here. Let's not do it here.

901
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,704
Let's, um... Let's go for a walk?

902
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,789
- Edgar.
- What?

903
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,040
- Okay.
- Okay.

904
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:18,752
<i>There's probably a lot
you wanna know about me.</i>

905
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,130
My husband's name was Ron Quicksilver.

906
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,174
He was a rodeo star.

907
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:26,302
He was so manly, there were
rumors he was chemically off.

908
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,053
He was the love of my life.

909
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,807
All I'm grateful for is,
he died a quick death.

910
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:33,934
He was trampled.

911
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,313
- Oh, no. By a bull?
- No.

912
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,773
It was a bunch of shoppers at
the Stereo Hut on Black Friday.

913
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,151
They had 50-inch flat screens for $199.

914
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:44,612
I did get one.

916
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:50,618
I realized your worst
fears can come true.

917
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:54,413
And I think maybe when
Ron died, I stopped living too.

918
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:55,873
I mean, I didn't really stop living.

919
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,708
I'm not dead. I'm not a ghost.

920
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:01,504
But after that wild night with you,
something shifted in me, you know?

921
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,506
Something's changing. I...

922
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:06,759
I wanna look at life for the
first time again, like a baby.

923
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:11,096
Gosh, I wanna be a baby
again. I was so flexible then.

924
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,890
Star went as a baby for Halloween once.

925
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,142
She wore a diaper. Only a diaper.

926
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:18,187
She won best costume.

927

God, I'm a terrible friend.
I wasted all that water.

930
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:35,746
Edgar, I'm sorry. This can't happen.

931
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,481
We weren't meant to be.

932

my gosh, I was thinking

His name is Carmine Testaviglio.

having an affair with Dina.

I didn't stand a chance.

Carmine had a foot fetish,

00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:09,843
<i>but he couldn't before the elderly mayor
mistook me for the actual Shrimp Queen</i>

1089
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,595
<i>and proceeded with the tradition.</i>

1090
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,598
He shoved me into the human cannon.

1091
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:20,562
<i>Then one of the girls
turned the dial all the way up.</i>

1092
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,355
I was shot out into the ocean.

1093
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,609
<i>As I rocketed through the air,</i>

1094
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:28,192
<i>the force of the wind
ripped off all of my clothes.</i>

1095
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,387
And I landed in the water...

1096
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:32,282
<i>of a pool.-.</i>

1097
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,577
Of a Disney Cruise Ship.

1098
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,205
<i>And there I was, a laughingstock,</i>

1099
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:42,042
<i>bobbing in the water like
a ball of fresh mozzarella.</i>

1100
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,295
From all the guilt and the stress,

1101
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:47,923
my poor father suffered a heart attack.

1102
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:52,219
And my mother abandoned me
to reinvent herself in Palm Springs.

1103
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,553
And <i>after</i> all that,

1104
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:56,389
I knew someday...

1105
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,684
I would get revenge on that small town,

1106
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:02,395
and everyone that chose to live in it.

1107
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:06,066
That dreadful town...

1108
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:09,778
that ruined my life

1109
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:13,490
and cost me everything.

1110
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:18,161
I think your feelings are valid
and this is the only answer.

1111
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:19,371
Thank you, Yoyo.

1112
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:22,874
But we have to get another microchip
to Edgar. We're running out of time.

1113
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:25,627
Oh, don't worry about that.

1114
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,630
Plan B is in already in motion.

1115
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:34,511

1120
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:46,565
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1121
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,525
It's me. We spoke on the phone.

1122
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,196
- Darlie Bunkle?
- Shoot! I forgot you knew my name.

1123
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,158
Yeah, it's me, Darlie
Bunkle. 205 Pagoda Drive.

1124
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,742
Is that your address?

1125
00:58:57,826 --> 00:59:00,412
Damn it! That was private.

1126
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,622
So, any idea when you think
the microchip will be ready?

1127
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:05,292
- It's ready. I have a plan.
- Good.

1128
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,544
A piece of paper will be
slipped under your door

1129
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:10,130
naming the time and
the place for the dropoff.

1130
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:13,049
It will lined notebook
paper with frayed edges.

1131
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:15,733
Letters will be small because
the message is private.

1132
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:19,306
Why don't you just tell it to me now

1133
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,589
instead of having to
come back here later on?

1134
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:30,108
Listen, Edgar, I've been
thinking about your idea.

1135
00:59:30,192 --> 00:59:32,402
You know, the one where I
just tell you where we're meeting

1136
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,571
instead of me driving
a piece of paper to you

1137
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:35,822
- wherever you are later?
- Yeah.

1138
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:39,117
And I like it. I like it.

1139
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:42,954
I'll meet you outside your hotel
room, probably at sundown.

1140
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:46,875
When you <i>see me</i> next, I'll be wearing
a large, purple, Zorro-style fedora,

1141
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:50,795
and the rest I don't know yet,
but I love colors, all of them.

1142
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:52,380
All right. I mean,
you're the expert. Okay.

1143
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:53,798
- Thank you. I am.
- Yeah.

1144
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:56,676
I'm gonna sneak out subtly,
show you how it's done.

1145
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:06,102
Damn it!

1146
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:10,023
Barb, look. A banana boat.

1147
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,691
I can't wait for us to
go on that together.

1148
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:12,776
Yeah.

1149
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:15,070
Ladies, I know I've said this a lot,

1150
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,697
but it's really hard to draw your
faces when you keep talking.

1151
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:19,991
- Sorry. Enough said. Yes.
- I'm sorry. Sorry about that.

1152
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:21,993
Apologize.

1153
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:23,495
- What is she drawing?
- I don't know.

1154
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:24,871
You just did it. You
moved your head again.

1155
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:26,081
- I'm a caricature.
- The suspense is killing me.

1156
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:28,208
I hope she gives me
bigger teeth. Love big teeth.

1157
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,668
- She loves big teeth.
- Good to know.

1158
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:33,046
I just like how everything is
accentuated in the caricatures.

1159
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,757
So, feel free to make my
teeth as big as you want.

1160
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,301
Like, just real big. Like,
even if it's just two eyes

1161
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:40,011
and a bunch of teeth, that would be...

1162
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:41,888
Barb. Um, uh...

1163
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:44,599
Gosh! All of a sudden,
I'm... I'm not feeling so good.

1164
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:47,143
Oh. Oh, no. Are you... Are you okay?

1165
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:49,396
I don't know. No. I think I have the flu.

1166
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,648
I think I should go lie down
in the room or something.

1167
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,400
Oh, Star. Do you want
me to come with you?

1168
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,985
No, no. I don't wanna ruin your day.

1169
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,194
Just, uh, go snorkeling?

1170
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:58,113
Snorkeling? In the
ocean? With the currents?

1171
01:00:58,196 --> 01:00:59,698
- Oh, I couldn't do that.
- Oh.

1172
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,700
Plus, we said we were
gonna do these things together.

1173
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:03,576
I'll just wait for you to get better.

1174
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,578
Probably a few hours or
so. I'm feeling very faint.

1175
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,289
But, um, I'll see
you... I'll <i>see</i> you then.

1176
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:08,822
- All right. I'm done.
- Star.

1177
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,543
And there you go. Enjoy.

1178
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:15,547
I can <i>see</i> where the
talking was problematic.

1179
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,882
That's what your face was doing.

1180
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,147
You want in?

1181
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,482
Oh, no. No, thanks.

1182
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:54,294

Oh. Yup. It's a fever, 137.

- Oh.
- You better rest.

Look at you. Looks like
you're getting a little tan.

Oh.

1192
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:29,055
There's a skylight in
the business center.

1193
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:30,098
Oh.

1194
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,433
I've been in the business center.

1195

- Okay. Well, I better... gosh!
- I don't wanna give you what I have.

1196
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,019
- I'm gonna let you get you rest. Yeah.
- Contagious.

1197
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:36,146
I'm so sick.

1198
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:37,981
Yeah, I'll check in with you later.

1199
01:03:57,709 --> 01:03:58,960
Woo-hoo!

01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:06,134
Woo! This is living!

01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:08,428
Woo!

1202
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:15,602
Mm.

1203
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:18,396
These just arrived.

1204
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:28,031
Well, looks like Edgar
is distracting himself.

1205
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:29,949
Hmm.

1206
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:34,579
Well, she <i>is</i> beautiful.

1207
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:36,312
You want me to take care of them?

1208
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:40,668
No, Yoyo. I'll handle this.

1209
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,972
Ow! Oh, my elbow!

1210
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:56,768
- Here!
- Oh, my.

1211
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:58,186
Take my calloused hand.

1212
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:02,857
Oh. That's very calloused.

1213
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:04,901
Wow! Feels like barnacles.

1214
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:07,362
Oh, yeah. I fell on my elbow.

1215
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:09,280
It's... it's all right. It'll be fine.

1216
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:14,285
What is such a beautiful woman
doing all alone out here in the sticks?

1217
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:18,331
Oh. I'm just changing
into my regular clothes.

1218
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,792
I... I'm sorry. I thought
it was private here.

1219
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,043
- Give me your arm.
- What?

1220
01:05:22,126 --> 01:05:23,753
- Your arm.
- Oh.

1221
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,090
Thank you.

1222
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,968
What do you mean, regular clothes?

1223
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:33,304
It's a long story. I'm on
vacation, and my friend is sick,

1224
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:35,223
and I've been pretending
that I'm doing nothing,

1225
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:37,100
but I've been doing everything.

1226
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,434
Anyway, I feel bad.

1227
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:41,104
But I have to admit, I also
have never felt more alive.

1228
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:42,480
Am I a bad friend?

1229
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:46,150
You could only be a friend if
you're a friend to yourself first.

1230
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:48,027
That is where you find your truth.

1231
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:49,779
What if I don't know my truth?

1232
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:51,823
- What if you do?
- Oh.

1233
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:53,956
You are finding your courage, your voice.

1234
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,203
- You're being delivered.
- I am?

1235
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:58,371
It is time to mount the wind

1236
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:02,417
and ride it with the
fierceness of a hippopotamus.

1237
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,253
Okay.

1238
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:06,796
- A-hoya!
- Oh.

1239
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,758
- You are rising.
- Oh, my God.

1240
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:14,554
Your truth is that you are... a phoenix.

1241
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,224
Dumbledore's bird.

1242

- Who?
- Dumbledore.

I must leave now... to
finish my swamp walk.

Remember, your shimmer is on the horizon.

1245

My shimmer? How did you know that?

1246
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:36,576
It's what I do.

1247

The name is Tommy.

1249
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:45,835
Tommy Bahama.

1250
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:55,303

Oh, Edgar, what are we
gonna do when this trip is over?

1254
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:04,812
Let's not talk about the future.

1255
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:06,564
I just wanna spend every moment we have

1256
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:09,192
discovering different
levels of specialness in you.

1257
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,527
Oh, you're so amazing.

1258
01:07:11,611 --> 01:07:13,738
I have so many feelings in my heart.

1259
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:16,721
- Just incredible and amazing.
- I have those feelings too.

1260
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:24,957
You've been pleasuring me a lot lately.

1261
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:28,378
In that last position, your
dong went really deep.

1262
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:30,838
I think your dong went
all the way up and...

1263
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:33,675
touched my heart.

1264
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:36,052
So, what do we do now?

1265
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:38,346
I mean, do you still just
want meaningless flings

1266
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:40,765
- or something more...
- Official?

1267
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:45,478
What? Oh, Star!

1268
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:57,573
Oh, I have to go. I have...
I have a business meeting.

1269
01:07:57,657 --> 01:07:59,367
Oh, business meeting.

1270
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:02,036
Oh, no. I wish I could tell
you more about my job,

1271
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,371
- but...
- No. No. Come on.

1272
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:04,872
What else is there to know?

1273
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:07,917
You're a clam inspector, and
you're in town on top business.

1274
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,134
Okay.

1278
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:39,907
I'm in a big pickle, little crab.

1279
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:43,453
What am I gonna do?

1280
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:49,250
Go with your heart. Love is rare.

1281
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:51,210
True friends forgive.

1282
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,547
Oh. Well, that makes me feel better.

1283

1284

01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:04,724
she is not gonna talk to you again.

1287
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:08,603
Oh. Well, thanks a lot.

1288

- No, Star!

A killer?

1434
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:09,899
But, Barb, what you're
saying is ridiculous.

There's nothing ridiculous
about what I'm saying.

1436
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:13,569
Edgar put a receiver in the
middle of the Seafood Jam

1437
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:15,738

It's more of a game, really.

01:42:07,913 --> 01:42:09,373
I can feel a little granules, like,

1861
01:42:09,457 --> 01:42:11,292

- Your teeth? Oh!

- I just got some. There you go.
- Oh, there you go.

Can we talk about horses now?

There are good ships and wood ships,

1871
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:40,185
and ships that sail the sea.

But the best ships are friendships
