Wait, you come in here
when the store is closed

172
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,302
and host
your Thanksgiving dinners?

173
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,175
[both] No.

174
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,111
[Star] God I'm really upset.

175
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:14,146
I can't believe we're not
gonna work here anymore.

176
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,682
I'm grieving. I think...
I think I'm really grieving.

177
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,150
Me too, but you know what?

178
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,386
We'll find another job.
This small town's full of places

179
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,421
looking to hire women
in their 40s.

180
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,757
Yeah. That's the attitude!

181
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,126
-We'll find something better.
-Yeah.

182
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:30,129
I mean, we both
have high school degrees.

183
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,797
-Well, you do.
-Well, I don't.

184
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,766
-I thought you did.
-Well, I don't.

185
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,404
-Well, what can we do?
-[woman] Ladies!

186
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:39,839
Hi!

187
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,041
[both] Mickey.

188
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,977
[upbeat music playing]

189
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,748
-You look amazing.
-You look great.

190
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,249
-Wow.
-Miguel and I just got back

191
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,784
from vacation.

192
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,253
My dermatologist
is not gonna be happy with me.

193
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:57,490
I soaked up some mega rays.
[laughs]

194
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,792
Gosh, you can see it.
You look glowing.

195
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,593
You look really dark.

196
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,129
Girls, I might just pack up
and moved there.

197
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,930
-What? Where?
-[both] Where did you go?

198
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,933
It's this tiny little oasis
on the coast of Florida.

199
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,835
It's people like us.
Mid-lifers

200
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,938
who still like to strut past
the pool and stop the party

201
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:16,042
dead in its tracks with a tube
top and full jewelry.

202
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,177
-Oh. Yeah.
-[Mickey] I'm not kidding.

203
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,845
I feel like I got a soul-douche.

204
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,114
-A soul-douche? Well...
-[chuckling]

205
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,816
And not that I was looking,

206
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,352
but there are so many
gorgeous men there.

207
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:27,987
We're talking Tommy Bahama

208
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,255
from head to toe.

209
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,357
[both] Tommy Bahama.

210
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,392
Put that with a 24-hour CVS

211
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,294
and you got yourself a party.

212
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:38,798
I mean best week of my life.
You girls have got to go.

213
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,866
-Well, not the best--
-Oh, yeah, no.

214
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,168
-We're not--
-Time right now.

215
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,235
We're not in a place

216
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:44,970
-to really go anywhere.
-We can't really leave.

217
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,238
I'll drop off a brochure later.

218
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,941
-Oh, wow. Thank you.
-Oh, yeah.

219
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,376
-That won't be necessary.
-I mean, yeah.

220
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,144
It'd be nice to see
what it looks like.

221
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,379
What's the name
of the place again?

222
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,147
Vista Del Mar!

223
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,985
-View of the swordfish.
-View of the mar.

224
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,357
[Debbie]
Before we begin
I just wanna thank

225
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,427
Barb and Star for hosting
tonight's talking club

226
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,429
and for making their famous,

227
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,266
usual hot dog soup. Again.

228
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,235
-You're welcome.
-It's a simple recipe.

229
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,170
-Simple.
-Oh, Gail's not here,

230
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:21,507
but it's 6:00 on the dot.
So, it's time to lock the door.

231
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,178
-[knocking on door]
-[Gail] I'm here.

232
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,047
You're late Gail, buh-bye.

233
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,853
Well, Talking Club
is officially in session.

234
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,956
I was really hoping to talk
this week about horses.

235
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,058
Specifically my horse,

236
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,993
and the spectacular time
we had--

237
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,995
You know the rules, Delores.

238
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,164
We only share about the topic

239
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,166
that we pick out
of the talking jar.

240
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,268
Give me your soup.

241
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,447
Today's topic is...

242
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:04,450
jobs.

243
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,184
[women groan]

244
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:09,955
[Pinky] I wanted to talk about
my job at the Christmas store.

245
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:13,025
I know everyone thinks
it's not busy right now,

246
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:16,028
but we are... all year round.

247
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,365
-I believe you.
-Thank you.

248
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,901
Well, I love my job
at the pharmacy.

249
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,403
I get to play with the pills,

250
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:27,439
and sometimes I shake them
along to the music.

251
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,309
Star, we can't tell the ladies
what happened today.

252
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,378
What? You mean lie? We can't.

253
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,914
Oh, we just lost our job
at the hottest place in town.

254
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,415
-What will they think of us?
-[Debbie] Oh,

255
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:37,983
and I love my uniform.

256
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,084
It's all white,

257
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:42,454
so I get to set myself apart
with character socks.

258
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,057
-[all gasp]
-Those look fun.

259
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,960
These have coffee cups
and coffee beans on them.

260
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,429
-[laughs] I wish you dress me.
-I don't have time.

261
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,898
Barb and Star?
What about you guys?

262
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,067
I mean, you guys work at the
hottest place in town!

263
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,002
Maybe socks
would be a good topic.

264
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,138
Oh, yes. I love the socks
without ankle.

265
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,074
Barb, Star, the topic is jobs.

266
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,078
Tell us about your jobs.

267
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,280
-Oh. Well...
-Oh.

268
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:13,319
-[both] Uh... Today was...
-Uh, it was busy.

269
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,053
-It was busy.
-Yeah.

270
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,356
[both] So, we had a lot of--
Big delivery.

271
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,491
-[Star] One big delivery.
-With furniture.

272
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,126
-And sofa.
-Tables.

273
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,461
[both] There was a guy.

274
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,330
-[Star] He was delivering,
-[both] He was tall.

275
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,299
-[Barb] The other was shorter.
-[both] Not as tall.

276
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,401
-[Star] We filled out paperwork.
-Inventory.

277
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,269
Did everything.

278
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:33,138
-Then we had to load it all in.
-[Barb] To look at the samples.

279
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,307
-...brought the samples.
-[Star] ...clipboard.

280
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,610
-[Barb] Made some tea.
-We signed up.

281
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,112
[both] And then
we got a promotion.

282
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,146
-Oh!
-What?

283
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,349
-Wow!
-Congrats.

284
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,184
[Gail]
Congratulations you guys!

285
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,686
-Go home, Gail.
-[woman] We're so proud of you.

286
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,321
We should do a toast.

287
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,689
[neighs]

288
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:55,227
What? That's how
I cheers with my horse.

289
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,697
[snorts, chuckles]

290
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,401
Barb and I lost our jobs.

291
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,236
[gasp]

292
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,438
Sorry. The store closed.

293
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,074
And the story we just told you
about the delivery,

294
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,110
the men coming,
the trucks, the nightstands,

295
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,444
the fabric samples, the couches,

296
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,114
the tall guy and the shorter guy
that wasn't as tall?

297
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,749
-That was a lie! [whimpers]
-[gasp]

298
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,083
Oh, damn.

299
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:23,122
We all know there are only three
major rules in Talking Club.

300
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,191
Rule number one, no sneakers.

301
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,995
Rule number two, no swearing
except for the "F" word.

302
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:34,233
Rule number three, no lying.

303
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,302
You two are banned
from the club.

304
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:37,136
-What?
-What?

305
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,605
[Debbie] Ladies, grab your
purses, and pocket books.

306
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:42,274
-[Barb] No, Debbie, please.
-Isn't there like

307
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,009
a three-strike rule
or something?

308
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,312
Please, we won't do it again.
This is all we have left.

309
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,080
-Can we have one more chance?
-[Star] One more chance.

310
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,515
-[Barb] Please.
-[Star] It was just one lie.

311
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,784
-[Barb] Give us a chance.
-We don't know what to say.

312
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:55,154
[dramatic music playing]

313
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:56,422
[door closes]

314
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:02,194
Barb, are you upset with me?
I'm sorry I blurted it out.

315
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:05,264
[Barb] Star, no.
I can never be upset with you.

316
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:09,301
It's okay, we lied.
We deserved it.

317
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,739
Do you know
they make denim culottes?

318
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,375
They're for our weather.

319
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,210
Do you think
Jennifer Convertibles closing

320
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:19,244
was a sign?

321
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,580
And getting kicked out
of Talking Club?

322
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:23,615
A sign?

323
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,086
Okay. You know those days
when you see me

324
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,121
-just staring at the carpet?
-Yes.

325
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,756
Sometimes I daydream.

326
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:33,359
About life
outside of this place.

327
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,529
Maybe something is telling us
to do something different.

328
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,299
-Oh, my gosh. Yes.
-Yes? Oh!

329
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,668
Should we try those socks
with individual toes? [laughs]

330
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,136
-Yeah.
-What do they feel like?

331
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:44,870
I've always wondered.

332
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:48,073
I wonder how my toes will react.
They've always been together.

333
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,041
I think they'll like it.

334
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,377
-What if it's something bigger?
-Like what?

335
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:54,680
-Like this.
-[tropical tune plays]

336
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,181
-A trip?
-Yes.

337
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,649
-Star--
-No, look,

338
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,818
look at these two people.
Look how happy they are.

339
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,254
Imagine that's you and me
riding on that banana boat.

340
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,789
Just bouncing around

341
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,125
with our arms and legs
spread wide open

342
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,761
with water and air
going all inside of us.

343
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,396
This is dangerous.

344
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,830
Things happen to people
on trips.

345
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,432
What if we get lost,
or poisoned,

346
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,467
or we get a rash?
What if they put us in jail

347
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,202
'cause they think
we put drugs in our butts?

348
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,203
What if we fall out of a car?

349
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,539
Have you heard
of traveler's diarrhea, Star?

350
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:25,644
Your stomach doesn't care where
you are, it just releases.

351
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,646
Haven't you ever wondered
if the real ocean

352
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,181
sounds like our noise machine?

353
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,883
The real ocean
has strong currents.

354
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,719
And people get swept out,
and they sink and they drown.

355
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,122
[sighs] Okay.

356
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,592
I know things changed for you
after Ron died.

357
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,594
They certainly did for me
after Carmine Left.

358
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,730
But we used to have fun.

359
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,566
Remember that one time
we went on a haunted hay ride?

360
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,568
-[both chuckle]
-And we got chased by that man

361
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,437
with a Jack-o'-lantern head
and a chainsaw.

362
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,471
And then we heard later

363
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,340
he wasn't an actor, he just
escaped from the local prison.

364
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,775
-[laughs] He was a real killer.
-Killer.

365
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,677
-He was trying to kill us.
-[both] Oh.

366
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,313
Remember the 4th of July when
we roller skated through town

367
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,748
in our sequined leotards?

368
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,683
And my sparkler
caught your hair on fire?

369
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,618
And then my hair
caught your hair on fire.

370
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,588
[both laughing] We caught
each other's hair on fire.

371
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,356
Oh.

372
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:19,598
Barb, I feel like...
we lost our... shimmer.

373
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,402
Isn't that just what happens
when you get older?

374
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,504
No. I mean, it doesn't have to.

375
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,806
We still have a chance
to be those people again.

376
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,409
[scoffs] I mean,
look all of our stories.

377
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,910
They're-- they're from the past.

378
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,346
We don't
have any stories from now.

379
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,351
I feel like we're fading away.

380
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,920
I don't wanna fade away.

381
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,356
Hey, look, I know you're afraid
something is gonna go wrong,

382
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,625
but what if it doesn't?

383
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,827
What if we go there
and have a time of our lives?

384
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,863
We lay on the beach
and we feel the sun

385
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,631
and we have breakfast
and have muffins

386
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,433
and croissants
with all kinds of jelly--

387
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,901
-Let's do it.
-What?

388
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,605
I can't believe I'm saying this.
Let's throw caution to the wind

389
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,306
like a couple
of rock and rollers!

390
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,574
-[Star] Really?
-Yes.

391
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,576
-Barb.
-Star.

392
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,980
[both]
Let's go to Vista Del Mar.

393
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,414
[both squeal]

394
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,885
[Barb] I'm gonna bring those
culottes I bought at Kaboom.

395
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,653
-[Star] Culottes?
-[Barb] My fringe shorts.

396
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,255
-[Star] Tangerine pants.
-[Barb] Oh, my curlers.

397
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,390
I don't want anything
to happen to my curlers.

398
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,293
-Anyway--
-[Star] Cheese pizza.

399
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,462
Gosh, let me
just get mushroom. Well.

400
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,631
[Barb] Traveler's checks.
Leftover from my wedding.

401
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,566
[Star] For the shower.
Safety first.

402
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,002
[Barb] Always good to bring
a little piece of art

403
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,904
-from home.
-[Star] We're gonna buy a lot

404
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,338
-of Florida cookies.
-[Barb] Some rope.

405
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,673
[Star] This is gonna be
for the cheese pizza.

406
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:35,941
[Barb] My curlers.

407
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,244
[Star] This is a toilet
scrubber and a back scrubber.

408
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,713
[Barb] Maybe it's time
to put the curlers in.

409
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,882
-[Star] Vista Del Mar...
-[Barb] Here we come.

410
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,654
[suspenseful music playing]

411
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,824
What's on your mind?

412
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,960
[Dr. Lady] I'm just nervous
something is going to go wrong.

413
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,995
I even tried
to distract myself today

414
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,565
by training some of the mice
from the lab.

415
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:02,434
Everything is going to be
fine. I promise.

416
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:03,936
I want you to get there early.

417
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,437
Get the lay of the land.

418
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:06,939
Here's the microchip.

419
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,775
The receiver cannot
be activated without it.

420
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,311
Be very careful with it.
It's fragile.

421
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:14,746
There's a compartment for it
in your belt.

422
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,715
Yoyo designed it.

423
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,750
God, I love that little boy...

424
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,953
And most importantly...

425
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,021
the antidote.

426
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,389
You might get stung.

427
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,625
This will make you
immune to the poison.

428
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:30,362
-I won't let you down, my love.
-No, you won't.

429
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:36,535
I've been working on this plan
my entire life.

430
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:41,607
And now, it's finally time.

431
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,709
[Edgar] I can't wait for all
of this to be over.

432
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,744
After what those people
did to you,

433
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:46,878
and for you to be happy,

434
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,815
and for us to be
an official couple.

435
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,954
Um...

436
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,493
Mm-hmm. Yes.

437
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,363
You do wanna be together, right?

438
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,633
-Be an official couple?
-Mm-hmm.

439
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:10,936
Yes, of course I do.

440
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,537
[chuckles] I'm just, um,

441
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:15,474
it's hard for me relax.
You know, until this is over.

442
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,843
-You understand.
-Yeah.

443
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,044
So...

444
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,614
don't screw it up.

445
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,850
[climatic orchestra music plays]

446
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,387
Strings, you're still off.

447
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,422
-[mice groan]
-[conductor squeaking angrily]

448
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,523
The rest can have cheese.

449
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,425
[mice squeaking excitedly]

450
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,461
[tropical music playing]

451
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:40,999
Woo! Well, I was not
prepared for that take off.

452
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:41,833
Me neither.

453
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,536
Ma'am, I apologize for screaming
at the top of my lungs.

454
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:45,570
Mm.

455
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:49,408
-What? A free magazine! [gasps]
-What?

456
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,610
I have got to read
this interview with Don Cheadle.

457
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,446
Oh, I love him.
You know that reminds me,

458
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,148
the other day
I said to myself...

459
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,583
I cannot think of a famous
actress named Trish.

460
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,952
You're kidding.
That's my favorite name.

461
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,022
What? Mine too! How did we
never talk about this?

462
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:08,593
To me, a woman named Trish
is a woman you can count on.

463
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:11,530
Really has her act together.
Athletic, natural.

464
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,865
Just real natural.
And loves the holidays.

465
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,501
Trish? At Christmas? Forget it.

466
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:17,936
She gets everybody a gift.

467
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:19,705
-What about Halloween?
-Oh.

468
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,074
Trish leaves a big pot
of candy for the kids.

469
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,042
-Yeah.
-[both] Because she trusts.

470
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,544
-[chuckle]
-[Barb] She'd be out

471
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:26,912
-with her girlfriends.
-[Star] Country-dancing.

472
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,647
[Barb] She has a natural
sense of rhythm.

473
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,148
She'd have one ear
double-pierced.

474
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,817
-And the other...
-Just single.

475
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,653
Once when I was applying
for a job at Talbots,

476
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,855
-I told them my name was Trish.
-What? [laughs]

477
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:39,124
Well, remember when
I was in that hit and run

478
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:40,625
-and that lady passed?
-Uh-huh.

479
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:41,960
-Her name was Trish. Yeah.
-Really?

480
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:43,962
[Barb] Trish loses one of her
ears in a twister,

481
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:46,098
-but not her hearing.
-She's a storm chaser.

482
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,833
Her mom doesn't want her to be.

483
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,668
-Their relationship is tough.
-Hmm.

484
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,903
Trish always wanted to be
a portrait photographer.

485
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:54,439
She loves people.
She would always say,

486
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,641
"A person's face says
a lot about how they look."

487
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,009
-Oh, that's beautiful.
-Yeah.

488
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:58,944
[Star] Okay.

489
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,812
-Trish's favorite number?
-[both] Four.

490
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,614
-Her favorite animal?
-[both] Hen!

491
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:04,216
-Trish's favorite movie?
-Oh.

492
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:05,717
-Short Circuit.
-The Ring.

493
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,519
[both laugh]

494
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,489
And then she said,
"You know what, skin cancer?

495
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,691
"You are not gonna take me.

496
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,794
"Because I'm gonna take
my own life."

497
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:17,696
And she did.

498
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:22,067
She jumped off that cliff
near her house on the Cape.

499
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,668
Dove right into the water,

500
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,472
hitting every rock on the way.
[sniffles]

501
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:30,942
And now there's a beautiful
spirit out there in the ocean.

502
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,779
And you know what her name is?

503
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,117
[both] It's Trish.

504
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,487

to a small town

1186
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:52,115
in Florida called...

1187
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:55,051
Vista Del Mar.

1188
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:58,555
At my new school,
everyone made fun of me

1189
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:00,023
because of the way
that I looked.

1190
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:01,524
They would call me names like...

1191
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:02,659
-pale girl...
-Pale girl.

1192
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:04,728
-[Dr. Lady]
...white devil...
-White devil.

1193
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:06,529
-[Dr. Lady]
...and asshole.
-Asshole.

1194
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:09,165
[Dr. Lady]
I finally made one friend.

1195
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,668
Her name was Maria Margolis.

1196
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,838
She would stay inside with me.

1197
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,474
We would read
and create inventions,

1198
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:18,808
cook food from her culture.

1199
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:21,845
Then one day as we were walking
to her
casa,

1200
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,546
through the Vista Del Mar
swamps,

1201
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:28,184
an alligator jumped out
of the water and ate Maria

1202
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,754
-right in front of me.
-[Maria screaming]

1203
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:32,188
Really gobbled her up.

1204
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:36,693
She was my last friend.

1205
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,729
Years later,
my father convinced me

1206
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:43,767
to go to Vista Del Mar's
annual Seafood Jam.

1207
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,569
I remember looking up
on the stage

1208
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:48,438
at the four young pretty girls.

1209
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:51,574
One of them about to be crowned
the new Shrimp Queen.

1210
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,477
And then all of a sudden...

1211
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:56,713
a group of popular girls

1212
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,715
from my school
pushed me on to the stage...

1213
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,083
[laughter]

1214
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:03,520
...ripping my hat off,
replacing it with a fake crown.

1215
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:04,954
-No. No.
-[Dr. Lady]
Father was trying

1216
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:06,956
to get to the front,
but he couldn't

1217
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,258
before the elderly mayor
mistook me

1218
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:11,594
for the actual Shrimp Queen and
proceeded with the tradition.

1219
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:14,230
He shoved me
into the human cannon.

1220
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:20,136
Then one of the girls
turned the dial all the way up.

1221
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,971
I was shot out into the ocean.

1222
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:24,007
[crowd cheering]

1223
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,175
[Dr. Lady]
As I rocketed
through the air,

1224
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:28,077
the force of the wind
ripped off all of my clothes.

1225
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:30,613
And I landed in the water...

1226
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:31,915
of a pool...

1227
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:35,151
-of a Disney Cruise Ship.
-[ship horn blowing]

1228
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:37,921
[Dr. Lady]
And there I was,
a laughing stock.

1229
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:41,724
Bobbing in the water like
a ball of fresh mozzarella.

1230
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:43,092
[laughter]

1231
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,161
From all the guilt
and the stress,

1232
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:47,530
my poor father
suffered a heart attack.

1233
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:50,066
And my mother abandoned me
to reinvent herself

1234
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:53,136
in Palm Springs.
And after all that,

1235
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:54,971
I knew someday,

1236
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,808
I would get revenge
on that small town.

1237
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:02,011
And everyone
that chose to live in it.

1238
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:08,251
That dreadful town
that ruined my life

1239
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:13,022
and cost me everything.

1240
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:17,861
I think your feelings are valid
and this is the only answer.

1241
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:18,728
Thank you, Yoyo.

Oh. Oh. Nothing. Never mind.
I thought you were-- It wasn't.

1524
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:52,641
It's not. It's okay.
Never mind. [chuckles]

1525
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:54,977
-My head is just a little...
-[cell phone rings]

1526
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:58,781
That's my cell phone.

1527
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:00,616
-Oh. Phew!
-Yeah.

1528
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:05,054
It's work.
I should probably take this.

1529
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:06,088
Okay.

1530
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:07,690
See each other soon?

1531
01:12:08,023 --> 01:12:09,091
-Okay.
-Star.

1532
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:10,693
Yeah?

1533
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:11,960
I've never been this happy.

1534
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:13,462
Really?

1535
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:15,064
Oh.

1536
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:17,066
-[mumbling] Musical.
-What?

1537
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:22,137
Uh-uh. I've gonna be...
[chuckles, mumbles]

1538
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,839
-I didn't get it.
-[chuckles]

1539
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:25,841
I'm gonna be-- Yeah.
[chuckles]

1540
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:29,478
Okay.
[mumbles, chuckles]

1541
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:31,113
Hmm?

1542
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:34,516
[elevator door dings]

1543
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:41,623
-[elevator door dings]
-[dramatic music playing]

1544
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:42,891
[panting]

1545
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:45,794
Star.

1546
01:12:47,896 --> 01:12:50,632
[Edgar] Well, I don't know
how much clearer I can be.

1547
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:55,604
I've changed my mind.

1548
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:57,005
I see now, you've been using me.

1549
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,475
[Dr. Lady]
Edgar, don't be silly.

1550
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:00,809
We're almost at
the finish line.

1551
01:13:00,843 --> 01:13:03,946
And you and I can be official.

1552
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:05,581
Don't even try.

1553
01:13:05,614 --> 01:13:07,583
You know,
I've figured it all out.

1554
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:09,585
You pretended to loved me.

1555
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:11,019
You made me a bunch of promises

1556
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,554
so that I would come down here

1557
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:14,556
and place the receiver
on the stage,

1558
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:16,525
in the middle
of the Seafood Jam party,

1559
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:18,227
that will attract
thousands of deadly mosquitoes

1560
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:20,229
that are gonna kill
thousands of people.

1561
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:21,930
[woman] Excuse me.

1562
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:25,601
Did you get that leaf and pearl
necklace down by the boardwalk?

1563
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:29,071
[whispering] Oh, yes.
I got it at Baleafy Ornate.

1564
01:13:29,104 --> 01:13:30,572
I'm sorry. What?

1565
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:32,908
-Baleafy Ornate.
-What?

1566
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:35,244
And not that you care,
but I have met someone.

1567
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:38,547
And unlike you, I know-- I know
what real love feels like,

1568
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,649
and it is not
how you've treated me.

1569
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:44,820
-It feels amazing and special.
-[Dr. Lady]
Oh, Edgar,

1570
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:47,089
I really hate to be the one
to tell you this.

1571
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:48,757
You know, you-- your girlfriend

1572
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:51,059
and her little partner,
the ones with the fluffy hair

1573
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:53,796
-and the culottes.
-How do you know about them?

1574
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:57,266
Their spies, Edgar. They're not
who they say they are

1575
01:13:57,299 --> 01:13:59,234
and they've been playing you
all along.

1576
01:14:00,135 --> 01:14:02,504
-You're lying.
-[Dr. Lady]
I wish I was.

1577
01:14:02,538 --> 01:14:03,238
Luckily,

1578
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:06,074
I have some inside sources
at their agency.

1579
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,709
What agency?
Who do they work for?

1580
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:12,214
-The H...P... V.

1581
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:15,617
-Sounds familiar.
-[Dr. Lady]
Check your emails.

1582
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:17,886
We've intercepted some
of the photos they've sent back

1583
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,588
to headquarters.
I think you'll find

1584
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:21,557
there are some interesting ones.

1585
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:26,929
It all looks very fun.

1586
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:29,064
-Star, no.
-Oh,

1587
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:29,998
I know, Edgar,

1588
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:33,635
this must hurt that she
lied to you about loving you.

1589
01:14:34,002 --> 01:14:35,070
And I don't blame you

1590
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:37,239
about running into the arms
of another woman.

1591
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:39,641
I hadn't been there for you,
and I'm so sorry.

1592
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:43,679
Let's get away after this,
find a little place in Portugal

1593
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:45,714
where we can be official.

1594
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:48,584
I got the necklace
at Baleafy Ornate.

1595
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:51,019
-I cannot hear you. What?
-Baleafy Ornate.

1596
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:52,020
It's called Baleafy Ornate!

1597
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:54,223
It sells everything bay leaf!

1598
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:57,125
It's a play on words!
My God, lady!

1599
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:58,160
Okay.

1600
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:01,630
-Oh.
-[glass shatters]

1601
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:05,834
[Barb] Sorry I yelled.

1602
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:07,135
-Sorry.
-Shit!

1603
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:08,337
What shit?

1604
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:10,906
It was Barb, the other one.
She was listening

1605
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:12,708
at the door.
Damn, they're good...

1606
01:15:12,741 --> 01:15:14,843
spies.
I can't believe this.

1607
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:18,614
Edgar, you listen to me
and you listen to me good.

1608
01:15:27,222 --> 01:15:29,124
-Edgar?
-I'm listening.

1609
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:31,093
Okay. I just wanted to make
sure you could still hear me.

1610
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:32,995
Sometimes
the connection in here...

1611
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:33,729
Anyway,

1612
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:37,900
I need you to find those two.
And kill them.

1613
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:42,237
Star.

1614
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:44,740
Star!

1615
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:47,843
[coughs]

1616
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:50,012
Oh, don't bother
pretending to be sick anymore.

1617
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:51,880
I know all
about your little lies.

1618
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:53,949
And I know all
about you and Edgar.

1619
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:56,018
And guess what?
He's a bad man!

1620
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:57,286
And he's gonna do
something terrible!

1621
01:15:57,586 --> 01:15:58,520
-What?
-He's following orders

1622
01:15:58,854 --> 01:16:00,789
from someone. I overheard him
on the phone with his boss.

1623
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:01,557
His boss from Clamco?

1624
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:04,192
No, Star! He lied to you!
He's a killer!

1625
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:05,260
A killer?

1626
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:09,665
But, Barb, what you're saying
is ridiculous.

1627
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:11,333
There's nothing ridiculous
about what I'm saying.

1628
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:13,268
Edgar put a receiver
in the middle of the Seafood Jam

1629
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:15,404
that'll trigger deadly mosquitos
that'll fly into the crowd

1630
01:16:15,437 --> 01:16:17,639
and sting everybody
with their killer tails!

1631
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,876
Why are you doing this?
[gasps]

1632
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:25,080
-You're making this all up!
-Oh, come on.

1633
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:26,214
I cannot believe you.

1634
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:29,051
You're mad
because Edgar picked me!

1635
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:31,153
Get me a break.
I am not mad about that.

1636
01:16:31,186 --> 01:16:33,055
And I am not making it up.

1637
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:35,891
-I'm calling the police.
-[scoffs] Fine.

1638
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:39,728
Jeff's Banana Boats?

1639
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:41,797
I didn't go through with it.

1640
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:43,699
While I was lying here
in my deathbed?

1641
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:45,200
-You weren't sick.
-You didn't know that?

1642
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:47,302
-Because you lied.
-So did you.

1643
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:48,670
[both scoff]

1644
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:52,908
I should have gone
on that banana boat.

1645
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:54,376
-I wish I did.
-Oh.

1646
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:57,713
[Edgar] I hear it's a real
tit flapper.

1647
01:16:58,380 --> 01:16:59,281
[gasps]

1648
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:02,884
[dispatcher]
911, what's your emergency?

1649
01:17:02,918 --> 01:17:03,952
Uh, never mind.

1650
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:08,857
I thought I saw a burglar
but it was a... turtle.

1651
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:14,663
[suspenseful music playing]

1652
01:17:21,737 --> 01:17:23,238
[Dr. Lady]
Yoyo, where are you?

1653
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:24,940
The mosquitoes are almost there.

1654
01:17:25,273 --> 01:17:25,974
Goodie.

1655
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:29,811
And, remember, don't keep
the steering wheel too straight.

1656
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:32,147
Lots of tiny movements,
left to right.

1657
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:37,019
[groans] I wish we wouldn't
have had these ropes.

1658
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:38,787
-[grunting]
-Stop squirming.

1659
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:41,823
Believe me this is better.
I'm supposed to kill you guys.

1660
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:44,459
What? Who said to kill us?
Edgar, what is happening?

1661
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:47,229
-Ow! Our bracelets are sharp.
-These bracelets really hurt.

1662
01:17:47,262 --> 01:17:49,264
-They're sharp. I know.
-They're sharp, be careful

1663
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:51,466
with that. And we-- [groans]

1664
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,169
Edgar, you lied to me!

1665
01:17:54,202 --> 01:17:57,239
You should talk.
I know all about the HPV.

1666
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,375
Okay. Look, I was gonna
tell you about that.

1667
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:02,978
A lot of people have it.
I mean, you probably have it.

1668
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:05,213
What?
Stop trying to confuse me.

1669
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:08,316
Star, I thought
you we're different.

1670
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,518
Edgar.

1671
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:11,186
Don't let him
bamboozled you, Star.

1672
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:12,454
He's a murderer.
Tell her.

1673
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:15,524
-You're not who you say you are.
-You're not who you say you are.

1674
01:18:15,557 --> 01:18:18,226
We are who we are.
We're Barb and Star.

1675
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:21,329
Unlike you, Edgar,
you big effin' liar.

1676
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:22,364
Huh?

1677
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:24,266
God, I knew this wasn't real.

1678
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:26,268
And no one could ever
love me again.

1679
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:28,403
God, I'm in so much grief
right now.

1680
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:31,173
-Goodbye, ladies.
-[Barb] Edgar, please wait.

1681
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:32,941
A lot of innocent people
will die.

1682
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:34,543
[Star] At least tell us why?

1683
01:18:34,576 --> 01:18:37,312
Why you would ever be involved
with such an awful thing?

1684
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:44,086
[sighs] Fine.
I'll tell you.

1685
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:49,925
-Oh, he pulled up a chair.
-It's gonna be a long story.

1686
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:52,060
When I was seven years old
my father

1687
01:18:52,094 --> 01:18:53,862
left my mom,
my eleven sisters, and me.

1688
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:56,198
-[whispering] Use your bracelet.
-[Edgar] I was the oldest,

1689
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:57,833
so I had to support us.

1690
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,135
We had no money.

1691
01:19:01,369 --> 01:19:04,239
I did odd jobs.
I built lawnmowers for Honda.

1692
01:19:04,272 --> 01:19:06,141
I even tried to sell my poop
to farmers

1693
01:19:06,174 --> 01:19:07,976
saying that it was fertilizer.

1694
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:10,412
It was never enough.

1695
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:13,448
One day,
a woman wearing a cape

1696
01:19:13,482 --> 01:19:16,551
and bag over her head
put $50 in my cup.

1697
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:20,288
-Oh. Hmm.
-Oh. Mm-hmm.

1698
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:23,859
She started to seduce me

1699
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:25,327
as the errands
became more criminal.

1700
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,329
-[grunting]
-I fell under her spell.

1701
01:19:27,829 --> 01:19:29,331
I thought it was love.

1702
01:19:32,234 --> 01:19:33,935
I would do anything for her.

1703
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:36,171
We'd always talk
about this particular plan.

1704
01:19:36,204 --> 01:19:37,305
Her life's work.

1705
01:19:37,973 --> 01:19:39,841
When it came time to help her,
I said, Yes.

1706
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:41,576
Of course,
I had my reservations,

1707
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:42,844
but...

1708
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:47,282
But she said when it was over,
we could be an official couple.

1709
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:50,352
That's all I wanted at the time.
That's all I've ever wanted.

1710
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,221
People do crazy things for love.

1711
01:19:54,055 --> 01:19:56,391
Yeah, but, I mean,
killing people, that's...

1712
01:19:56,424 --> 01:19:57,359
that's a lot.

1713
01:19:57,692 --> 01:20:00,862
Yeah, it's a lot of people.
That's... that's a little crazy.

1714
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:03,231
Is it? Wouldn't you
have done it for Carmine?

1715
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:06,468
And you for Ron?

1716
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:10,205
Wait.

1717
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:12,874
How do you know about Barb's
dead husband, Ron Quicksilver?

1718
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:14,442
-Wait.
-She told me

1719
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:15,577
-when she came to see me.
-Oh.

1720
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:17,913
That night on the foot bridge
right before you did.

1721
01:20:17,946 --> 01:20:20,048
Well, you weren't supposed
to say that.

1722
01:20:20,448 --> 01:20:23,451
Goodbye, Barb and Star.
Whoever you are.

1723
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:30,058
Okay. We can talk about it.
Let's just talk about it.

1724
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:32,327
It's-- It was a long time ago.
A long time.

1725
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:35,096
[MC]
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome

1726
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:37,933
to the 49th Annual Seafood Jam,

1727
01:20:38,466 --> 01:20:40,202
where the clams are hot

1728
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:42,671
and the crowd
is on the older side.

1729
01:20:42,704 --> 01:20:44,639
[indistinct chatter]

1730
01:20:46,074 --> 01:20:47,309
People are gonna die!

1731
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:49,044
-We have to find Edgar!
-You're right,

1732
01:20:49,077 --> 01:20:51,279
but by me agreeing with you
about having to stop Edgar,

1733
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:53,181
I don't agree about
stopping being mad at you.

1734
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:55,150
We agree to go.
But I want you to know

1735
01:20:55,183 --> 01:20:56,685
that I'm frustrated and hurt

1736
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:58,420
and I'm really
freaking pissed off.

1737
01:20:58,453 --> 01:21:00,655
I'm freaking pissed off too.
It's not that I'm copying you

1738
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:01,990
-It's because I am.
-Fine.

1739
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:07,529
Hello.

1740
01:21:07,562 --> 01:21:08,597
[both] Hi.

1741
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,336
[dramatic music playing]

1742
01:21:16,104 --> 01:21:17,639
[seagulls calling]

1743
01:21:23,411 --> 01:21:24,579
[both gasp]

1744
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:28,950
-[Dr. Lady] Oh, hello.
-[both gasp]

1745
01:21:29,317 --> 01:21:31,253
Enjoying your vacation?

1746
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:33,488
-Well, um...
-Oh, um...

1747
01:21:33,521 --> 01:21:36,258
-It started out fine.
-...supposed to be a friend trip

1748
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:37,993
-We got here and we were...
-And we got here.

1749
01:21:38,026 --> 01:21:39,427
-No, I didn't--
-[Barb overlapping]

1750
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:41,730
The first night, we went out
to loosen up a little bit.

1751
01:21:41,763 --> 01:21:44,466
That's when we meet Edgar,
which was not a good idea.

1752
01:21:44,499 --> 01:21:47,068
Edgar and I started hanging out,
and I was lying to Barb,

1753
01:21:47,102 --> 01:21:49,037
-which I shouldn't have done...
-I met Tommy Bahama.

1754
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:51,006
-You met Tommy Bahama? Anyway...
-Then we discovered--

1755
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:51,840
Enough!

1756
01:21:52,173 --> 01:21:56,244
I have set up one last excursion
for the two of you.

1757
01:21:56,278 --> 01:21:58,513
[snickers]
It's more of a game, really.

1758
01:21:58,546 --> 01:22:04,019
The rules are
you get to choose how you die.

1759
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:05,153
-What?
-What?

1760
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:07,322
You can either
jump off that cliff behind you

1761
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:09,557
hitting every sharp rock
on the way down,

1762
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,426
ripping your skin
at every bounce

1763
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:14,462
or you can stay here
and have dinner

1764
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:18,667
with, um... my new friends.

1765
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,302
-[growling]
-There are two

1766
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:24,272
very hungry hot alligators
in those crates.

1767
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:25,473
[both] Alligators?

1768
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:27,142
-Oh, please. No, no...
-No, no, no...

1769
01:22:27,175 --> 01:22:30,512
That's what you get
for getting in my way.

1770
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:36,117
Now, you can kiss your
middle-aged, flat, wide asses...

1771
01:22:36,718 --> 01:22:37,619
[both gasp]

1772
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:40,555
...goodbye.

1773
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:41,690
-Please wait!
-Oh, my gosh!

1774
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:44,059
[Star] No, no, no, no, no, no.

1775
01:22:46,594 --> 01:22:48,763
Thanks a lot, Star, for making
me come on this trip.

1776
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,565
Now, we're gonna die
just like I predicted.

1777
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:52,567
Oh, will you just stop
your complaining for once?

1778
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,069
Seems to me like you've been
having the time

1779
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:55,737
-of your life here.
-Oh, I sure have.

1780
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:58,707
-[growling]
-[both whimpering]

1781
01:22:58,907 --> 01:23:02,344
[suspenseful music playing]

1782
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:12,587
When we get to heaven, we're not
living with each other,

1783
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:14,422
and we're not running around
playing harps

1784
01:23:14,456 --> 01:23:15,190
in our halos and wings!

1785
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:18,393
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm not even
gonna look for you up there!

1786
01:23:18,426 --> 01:23:20,428
I'm gonna find the farthest
cloud away from you.

1787
01:23:20,462 --> 01:23:22,197
And I'm gonna find Betsy Ross!

1788
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:24,132
And I'm gonna be
best friends with her.

1789
01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:26,301
And we're gonna ignore you
at all the parties.

1790
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:29,671
[whimpering]

1791
01:23:31,139 --> 01:23:33,141
I guess we're gonna die
on bad terms.

1792
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:34,409
I guess you're right.

1793
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:37,612
[dramatic music playing]

1794
01:23:43,118 --> 01:23:44,519
[screaming]

1795
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:48,790
[parachute flapping]

1796
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:52,293
[dramatic music playing]

1797
01:23:54,329 --> 01:23:56,464
-Our culottes!
-They're natural parachutes.

1798
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:11,379
[gasping]

1799
01:24:13,515 --> 01:24:15,250
I'm so sorry. Oh!

1800
01:24:15,283 --> 01:24:17,218
So sorry. Lying to you
was the hardest thing

1801
01:24:17,252 --> 01:24:18,386
I've ever had to do.

1802
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:20,221
-I'm sorry too.
-No. This is all my fault.

1803
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:21,756
None of this will be happening
if I hadn't suggested

1804
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:23,491
coming on this trip
in the first place.

1805
01:24:23,525 --> 01:24:25,794
Are you kidding? I've had
the time of my life here.

1806
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:27,595
I've done things
I never thought I would do.

1807
01:24:27,629 --> 01:24:29,597
-I went in the ocean, Star.
-[gasps]

1808
01:24:29,631 --> 01:24:31,766
-And I got my labia pierced.
-What?

1809
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,135
I took it out.
Immediately took it out.

1810
01:24:34,169 --> 01:24:36,204
I should never have spent
all that time with Edgar

1811
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:37,872
behind your back.
I should've told you.

1812
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:40,508
I know you're only
trying to protect my feelings.

1813
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:42,277
And I'm so happy you found love.

1814
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:43,678
[giggling]

1815
01:24:44,612 --> 01:24:47,415
I mean, it's unfortunate that
he turned out to be a conman

1816
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:50,151
-and a mass murderer.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1817
01:24:50,185 --> 01:24:51,286
[both gasp]

1818
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:52,387
-Oh, my God.
-[Star] Edgar.

1819
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,189
-[both] We have to stop him.
-Go!

1820
01:24:55,056 --> 01:24:58,226
[MC] The Seafood Jam
just keeps on jamming!

1821
01:24:58,693 --> 01:24:59,861
[Dr. Lady] Nice view.

1822
01:25:02,697 --> 01:25:04,332
-[slurping]
-What are you doing here?

1823
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:06,835
Cleaning up your mess.

1824
01:25:06,868 --> 01:25:08,503
Seems like
you can't follow through

1825
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:10,538
with anything these days.
For example,

1826
01:25:10,572 --> 01:25:12,607
getting rid
of your little friends.

1827
01:25:14,309 --> 01:25:17,445
-I did. I-I mean, I--
-Oh, it's okay, Edgar.

1828
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:19,914
I took care of them myself.

1829
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:20,849
What?

1830
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:23,518
-What did you do?
-Let's just say

1831
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:25,787
there are a couple
of alligators out there

1832
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:29,290
with bellies full of... them.

1833
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:33,328
Oh, don't be so sad, Edgar.

1834
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:36,498
Those two were just a couple
of pathetic Stellas

1835
01:25:36,531 --> 01:25:38,366
trying to get their groove back.

1836
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:40,401
But they were spies, right?

1837
01:25:41,135 --> 01:25:43,805
I mean, you told me
that they were spies.

1838
01:25:43,838 --> 01:25:46,474
Sorry. I just said that
to get what I want.

1839
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:48,576
Sometimes I do that,

1840
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:52,247
but I'll work on it
on our relationship, I promise.

1841
01:25:52,614 --> 01:25:55,216
That is still what you want,
isn't it, Edgar?

1842
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:56,684
To be official?

1843
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:01,789
And, um, the receiver
is in position?

1844
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:03,658
It's on the stage.

1845
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:05,793
-The microchip is inside.
-Good.

1846
01:26:11,766 --> 01:26:12,867
This is it.

1847
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:15,270
My moment of glory.

1848
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:21,543
Goodbye, Vista Del Mar.
You stupid place

1849
01:26:21,576 --> 01:26:22,844
full of dummies.

1850
01:26:26,648 --> 01:26:28,416
[detonator beeping]

1851
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:32,420
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1852
01:26:32,954 --> 01:26:34,422
Shit.

1853
01:26:36,824 --> 01:26:39,227
[dramatic music playing]

1854
01:26:42,931 --> 01:26:44,532
-Shit.
-[MC] Of course, shrimp

1855
01:26:44,566 --> 01:26:47,302
is the most popular fish
