Wait, you come in here
when the store is closed

172
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:03,472
and host
your Thanksgiving dinners?

173
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:09,304
[both] No.

174
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,220
[Star] God I'm really upset.

175
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:14,265
I can't believe we're not
gonna work here anymore.

176
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:16,659
I'm grieving. I think...
I think I'm really grieving.

177
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,269
Me too, but you know what?

178
00:10:18,313 --> 00:10:20,576
We'll find another job.
This small town's full of places

179
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,622
looking to hire women
in their 40s.

180
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:24,754
Yeah. That's the attitude!

181
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:27,235
-We'll find something better.
-Yeah.

182
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,238
I mean, we both
have high school degrees.

183
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:31,805
-Well, you do.
-Well, I don't.

184
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:33,763
-I thought you did.
-Well, I don't.

185
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:38,594
-Well, what can we do?
-[woman] Ladies!

186
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,856
Hi!

187
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:42,119
[both] Mickey.

188
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:45,035
[upbeat music playing]

189
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:48,735
-You look amazing.
-You look great.

190
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:50,388
-Wow.
-Miguel and I just got back

191
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:51,781
from vacation.

192
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:54,392
My dermatologist
is not gonna be happy with me.

193
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:57,700
I soaked up some mega rays.
[laughs]

194
00:10:57,744 --> 00:10:59,789
Gosh, you can see it.
You look glowing.

195
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:00,834
You look really dark.

196
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:03,227
Girls, I might just pack up
and moved there.

197
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:04,968
-What? Where?
-[both] Where did you go?

198
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:07,971
It's this tiny little oasis
on the coast of Florida.

199
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:09,843
It's people like us.
Mid-lifers

200
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:12,976
who still like to strut past
the pool and stop the party

201
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,110
dead in its tracks with a tube
top and full jewelry.

202
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:18,286
-Oh. Yeah.
-[Mickey] I'm not kidding.

203
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:19,853
I feel like I got a soul-douche.

204
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:22,203
-A soul-douche? Well...
-[chuckling]

205
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:23,813
And not that I was looking,

206
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:26,511
but there are so many
gorgeous men there.

207
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:28,035
We're talking Tommy Bahama

208
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:29,384
from head to toe.

209
00:11:29,427 --> 00:11:31,516
[both] Tommy Bahama.

210
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:33,562
Put that with a 24-hour CVS

211
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:35,433
and you got yourself a party.

212
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:38,785
I mean best week of my life.
You girls have got to go.

213
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:40,874
-Well, not the best--
-Oh, yeah, no.

214
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:42,266
-We're not--
-Time right now.

215
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,354
We're not in a place

216
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:45,008
-to really go anywhere.
-We can't really leave.

217
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:46,357
I'll drop off a brochure later.

218
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:48,969
-Oh, wow. Thank you.
-Oh, yeah.

219
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:50,535
-That won't be necessary.
-I mean, yeah.

220
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:52,233
It'd be nice to see
what it looks like.

221
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:53,538
What's the name
of the place again?

222
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:55,236
Vista Del Mar!

223
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,023
-View of the swordfish.
-View of the mar.

224
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:05,507
[Debbie] Before we begin
I just wanna thank

225
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,597
Barb and Star for hosting
tonight's talking club

226
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,599
and for making their famous,

227
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,385
usual hot dog soup. Again.

228
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:16,344
-You're welcome.
-It's a simple recipe.

229
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:18,259
-Simple.
-Oh, Gail's not here,

230
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:21,697
but it's 6:00 on the dot.
So, it's time to lock the door.

231
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:26,267
-[knocking on door]
-[Gail] I'm here.

232
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,095
You're late Gail, buh-bye.

233
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:33,840
Well, Talking Club
is officially in session.

234
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:36,973
I was really hoping to talk
this week about horses.

235
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,106
Specifically my horse,

236
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:41,021
and the spectacular time
we had--

237
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:43,023
You know the rules, Delores.

238
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:45,242
We only share about the topic

239
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:47,244
that we pick out
of the talking jar.

240
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:49,377
Give me your soup.

241
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:01,606
Today's topic is...

242
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:04,609
jobs.

243
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:05,567
[women groan]

244
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:09,963
[Pinky] I wanted to talk about
my job at the Christmas store.

245
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:13,053
I know everyone thinks
it's not busy right now,

246
00:13:13,096 --> 00:13:16,056
but we are... all year round.

247
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:19,494
-I believe you.
-Thank you.

248
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,888
Well, I love my job
at the pharmacy.

249
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:24,542
I get to play with the pills,

250
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:27,589
and sometimes I shake them
along to the music.

251
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:30,418
Star, we can't tell the ladies
what happened today.

252
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:32,507
What? You mean lie? We can't.

253
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,901
Oh, we just lost our job
at the hottest place in town.

254
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:36,554
-What will they think of us?
-[Debbie] Oh,

255
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:37,991
and I love my uniform.

256
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:39,427
It's all white,

257
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,604
so I get to set myself apart
with character socks.

258
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:45,085
-[all gasp]
-Those look fun.

259
00:13:45,128 --> 00:13:47,957
These have coffee cups
and coffee beans on them.

260
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:50,568
-[laughs] I wish you dress me.
-I don't have time.

261
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:52,875
Barb and Star?
What about you guys?

262
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:55,095
I mean, you guys work at the
hottest place in town!

263
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:57,010
Maybe socks
would be a good topic.

264
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:59,186
Oh, yes. I love the socks
without ankle.

265
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:02,102
Barb, Star, the topic is jobs.

266
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:06,106
Tell us about your jobs.

267
00:14:06,758 --> 00:14:08,369
-Oh. Well...
-Oh.

268
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:13,417
-[both] Uh... Today was...
-Uh, it was busy.

269
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:14,375
-It was busy.
-Yeah.

270
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:17,465
[both] So, we had a lot of--
Big delivery.

271
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:19,641
-[Star] One big delivery.
-With furniture.

272
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:21,164
-And sofa.
-Tables.

273
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,600
[both] There was a guy.

274
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:24,428
-[Star] He was delivering,
-[both] He was tall.

275
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:27,388
-[Barb] The other was shorter.
-[both] Not as tall.

276
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:29,520
-[Star] We filled out paperwork.
-Inventory.

277
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:30,652
Did everything.

278
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:33,176
-Then we had to load it all in.
-[Barb] To look at the samples.

279
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,396
-...brought the samples.
-[Star] ...clipboard.

280
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:37,789
-[Barb] Made some tea.
-We signed up.

281
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,140
[both] And then
we got a promotion.

282
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:41,184
-Oh!
-What?

283
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,447
-Wow!
-Congrats.

284
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,232
[Gail]
Congratulations you guys!

285
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:47,887
-Go home, Gail.
-[woman] We're so proud of you.

286
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,410
We should do a toast.

287
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:50,890
[neighs]

288
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:55,285
What? That's how
I cheers with my horse.

289
00:14:56,243 --> 00:14:58,898
[snorts, chuckles]

290
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:02,510
Barb and I lost our jobs.

291
00:15:02,553 --> 00:15:04,294
[gasp]

292
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:06,557
Sorry. The store closed.

293
00:15:06,601 --> 00:15:09,082
And the story we just told you
about the delivery,

294
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,127
the men coming,
the trucks, the nightstands,

295
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:12,563
the fabric samples, the couches,

296
00:15:12,607 --> 00:15:15,131
the tall guy and the shorter guy
that wasn't as tall?

297
00:15:15,175 --> 00:15:16,959
-That was a lie! [whimpers]
-[gasp]

298
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:18,091
Oh, damn.

299
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:23,139
We all know there are only three
major rules in Talking Club.

300
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,229
Rule number one, no sneakers.

301
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:29,972
Rule number two, no swearing
except for the "F" word.

302
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:34,281
Rule number three, no lying.

303
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:36,370
You two are banned
from the club.

304
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:37,458
-What?
-What?

305
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,764
[Debbie] Ladies, grab your
purses, and pocket books.

306
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:42,332
-[Barb] No, Debbie, please.
-Isn't there like

307
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:43,986
a three-strike rule
or something?

308
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,380
Please, we won't do it again.
This is all we have left.

309
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:48,077
-Can we have one more chance?
-[Star] One more chance.

310
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:49,644
-[Barb] Please.
-[Star] It was just one lie.

311
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:51,994
-[Barb] Give us a chance.
-We don't know what to say.

312
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:55,171
[dramatic music playing]

313
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:56,520
[door closes]

314
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:02,222
Barb, are you upset with me?
I'm sorry I blurted it out.

315
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:05,312
[Barb] Star, no.
I can never be upset with you.

316
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:09,359
It's okay, we lied.
We deserved it.

317
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:13,929
Do you know
they make denim culottes?

318
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,453
They're for our weather.

319
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:18,238
Do you think
Jennifer Convertibles closing

320
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:19,282
was a sign?

321
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:21,719
And getting kicked out
of Talking Club?

322
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:23,765
A sign?

323
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:27,073
Okay. You know those days
when you see me

324
00:16:27,116 --> 00:16:29,118
-just staring at the carpet?
-Yes.

325
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:30,946
Sometimes I daydream.

326
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,427
About life
outside of this place.

327
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,648
Maybe something is telling us
to do something different.

328
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:40,347
-Oh, my gosh. Yes.
-Yes? Oh!

329
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,827
Should we try those socks
with individual toes? [laughs]

330
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:44,133
-Yeah.
-What do they feel like?

331
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:45,091
I've always wondered.

332
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,050
I wonder how my toes will react.
They've always been together.

333
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:49,312
I think they'll like it.

334
00:16:49,356 --> 00:16:51,445
-What if it's something bigger?
-Like what?

335
00:16:52,228 --> 00:16:54,839
-Like this.
-[tropical tune plays]

336
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:56,189
-A trip?
-Yes.

337
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:57,799
-Star--
-No, look,

338
00:16:57,842 --> 00:17:00,019
look at these two people.
Look how happy they are.

339
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:02,282
Imagine that's you and me
riding on that banana boat.

340
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:03,979
Just bouncing around

341
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:06,112
with our arms and legs
spread wide open

342
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:08,940
with water and air
going all inside of us.

343
00:17:08,983 --> 00:17:10,464
This is dangerous.

344
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:12,031
Things happen to people
on trips.

345
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,510
What if we get lost,
or poisoned,

346
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:15,556
or we get a rash?
What if they put us in jail

347
00:17:15,598 --> 00:17:17,210
'cause they think
we put drugs in our butts?

348
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:18,515
What if we fall out of a car?

349
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,647
Have you heard
of traveler's diarrhea, Star?

350
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:25,782
Your stomach doesn't care where
you are, it just releases.

351
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:27,785
Haven't you ever wondered
if the real ocean

352
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,178
sounds like our noise machine?

353
00:17:29,222 --> 00:17:31,093
The real ocean
has strong currents.

354
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:33,877
And people get swept out,
and they sink and they drown.

355
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:37,098
[sighs] Okay.

356
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,711
I know things changed for you
after Ron died.

357
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:42,713
They certainly did for me
after Carmine Left.

358
00:17:42,757 --> 00:17:44,888
But we used to have fun.

359
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:47,675
Remember that one time
we went on a haunted hay ride?

360
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:49,676
-[both chuckle]
-And we got chased by that man

361
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,505
with a Jack-o'-lantern head
and a chainsaw.

362
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:52,854
And then we heard later

363
00:17:53,202 --> 00:17:55,378
he wasn't an actor, he just
escaped from the local prison.

364
00:17:55,422 --> 00:17:56,945
-[laughs] He was a real killer.
-Killer.

365
00:17:56,988 --> 00:17:58,816
-He was trying to kill us.
-[both] Oh.

366
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,341
Remember the 4th of July when
we roller skated through town

367
00:18:01,384 --> 00:18:02,907
in our sequined leotards?

368
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:04,822
And my sparkler
caught your hair on fire?

369
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:06,737
And then my hair
caught your hair on fire.

370
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:09,697
[both laughing] We caught
each other's hair on fire.

371
00:18:10,263 --> 00:18:11,394
Oh.

372
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:19,707
Barb, I feel like...
we lost our... shimmer.

373
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:23,450
Isn't that just what happens
when you get older?

374
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:25,582
No. I mean, it doesn't have to.

375
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,976
We still have a chance
to be those people again.

376
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:30,457
[scoffs] I mean,
look all of our stories.

377
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,111
They're-- they're from the past.

378
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:34,374
We don't
have any stories from now.

379
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:39,379
I feel like we're fading away.

380
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:42,121
I don't wanna fade away.

381
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:44,384
Hey, look, I know you're afraid
something is gonna go wrong,

382
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:46,734
but what if it doesn't?

383
00:18:46,777 --> 00:18:48,997
What if we go there
and have a time of our lives?

384
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,042
We lay on the beach
and we feel the sun

385
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:52,740
and we have breakfast
and have muffins

386
00:18:52,783 --> 00:18:54,481
and croissants
with all kinds of jelly--

387
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:56,091
-Let's do it.
-What?

388
00:18:56,961 --> 00:18:59,703
I can't believe I'm saying this.
Let's throw caution to the wind

389
00:18:59,747 --> 00:19:01,314
like a couple
of rock and rollers!

390
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:02,663
-[Star] Really?
-Yes.

391
00:19:03,316 --> 00:19:04,665
-Barb.
-Star.

392
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:08,190
[both]
Let's go to Vista Del Mar.

393
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:09,452
[both squeal]

394
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,064
[Barb] I'm gonna bring those
culottes I bought at Kaboom.

395
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:14,762
-[Star] Culottes?
-[Barb] My fringe shorts.

396
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:16,242
-[Star] Tangerine pants.
-[Barb] Oh, my curlers.

397
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:18,418
I don't want anything
to happen to my curlers.

398
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:21,290
-Anyway--
-[Star] Cheese pizza.

399
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:23,510
Gosh, let me
just get mushroom. Well.

400
00:19:23,553 --> 00:19:25,729
[Barb] Traveler's checks.
Leftover from my wedding.

401
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:27,644
[Star] For the shower.
Safety first.

402
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:30,212
[Barb] Always good to bring
a little piece of art

403
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:32,083
-from home.
-[Star] We're gonna buy a lot

404
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:33,346
-of Florida cookies.
-[Barb] Some rope.

405
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:34,782
[Star] This is gonna be
for the cheese pizza.

406
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:36,131
[Barb] My curlers.

407
00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:39,221
[Star] This is a toilet
scrubber and a back scrubber.

408
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:41,832
[Barb] Maybe it's time
to put the curlers in.

409
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:44,052
-[Star] Vista Del Mar...
-[Barb] Here we come.

410
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:48,752
[suspenseful music playing]

411
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:53,279
What's on your mind?

412
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,150
[Dr. Lady] I'm just nervous
something is going to go wrong.

413
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,196
I even tried
to distract myself today

414
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,633
by training some of the mice
from the lab.

415
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:02,462
Everything is going to be
fine. I promise.

416
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:04,115
I want you to get there early.

417
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,465
Get the lay of the land.

418
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:07,118
Here's the microchip.

419
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:09,904
The receiver cannot
be activated without it.

420
00:20:09,947 --> 00:20:12,298
Be very careful with it.
It's fragile.

421
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:14,865
There's a compartment for it
in your belt.

422
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:16,824
Yoyo designed it.

423
00:20:17,128 --> 00:20:18,869
God, I love that little boy...

424
00:20:19,827 --> 00:20:21,132
And most importantly...

425
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:23,222
the antidote.

426
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:24,397
You might get stung.

427
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,703
This will make you
immune to the poison.

428
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:30,359
-I won't let you down, my love.
-No, you won't.

429
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,583
I've been working on this plan
my entire life.

430
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:41,675
And now, it's finally time.

431
00:20:41,718 --> 00:20:43,807
[Edgar] I can't wait for all
of this to be over.

432
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:45,853
After what those people
did to you,

433
00:20:45,896 --> 00:20:47,028
and for you to be happy,

434
00:20:48,072 --> 00:20:49,944
and for us to be
an official couple.

435
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:56,124
Um...

436
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,521
Mm-hmm. Yes.

437
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:04,350
You do wanna be together, right?

438
00:21:05,394 --> 00:21:07,701
-Be an official couple?
-Mm-hmm.

439
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:11,095
Yes, of course I do.

440
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:12,575
[chuckles] I'm just, um,

441
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:15,491
it's hard for me relax.
You know, until this is over.

442
00:21:15,535 --> 00:21:17,972
-You understand.
-Yeah.

443
00:21:18,015 --> 00:21:19,234
So...

444
00:21:20,627 --> 00:21:22,672
don't screw it up.

445
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:24,979
[climatic orchestra music plays]

446
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:28,374
Strings, you're still off.

447
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:30,419
-[mice groan]
-[conductor squeaking angrily]

448
00:21:30,463 --> 00:21:31,551
The rest can have cheese.

449
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:33,422
[mice squeaking excitedly]

450
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:36,469
[tropical music playing]

451
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:41,169
Woo! Well, I was not
prepared for that take off.

452
00:21:41,212 --> 00:21:42,257
Me neither.

453
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:44,564
Ma'am, I apologize for screaming
at the top of my lungs.

454
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:45,608
Mm.

455
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:49,395
-What? A free magazine! [gasps]
-What?

456
00:21:49,438 --> 00:21:51,658
I have got to read
this interview with Don Cheadle.

457
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:54,443
Oh, I love him.
You know that reminds me,

458
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:56,358
the other day
I said to myself...

459
00:21:56,402 --> 00:21:58,621
I cannot think of a famous
actress named Trish.

460
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,102
You're kidding.
That's my favorite name.

461
00:22:01,145 --> 00:22:04,192
What? Mine too! How did we
never talk about this?

462
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:08,631
To me, a woman named Trish
is a woman you can count on.

463
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:11,547
Really has her act together.
Athletic, natural.

464
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:13,984
Just real natural.
And loves the holidays.

465
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:16,509
Trish? At Christmas? Forget it.

466
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:18,075
She gets everybody a gift.

467
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:19,773
-What about Halloween?
-Oh.

468
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:22,253
Trish leaves a big pot
of candy for the kids.

469
00:22:22,297 --> 00:22:24,212
-Yeah.
-[both] Because she trusts.

470
00:22:24,255 --> 00:22:25,561
-[chuckle]
-[Barb] She'd be out

471
00:22:25,605 --> 00:22:27,041
-with her girlfriends.
-[Star] Country-dancing.

472
00:22:27,084 --> 00:22:28,695
[Barb] She has a natural
sense of rhythm.

473
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:30,349
She'd have one ear
double-pierced.

474
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:31,915
-And the other...
-Just single.

475
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:34,701
Once when I was applying
for a job at Talbots,

476
00:22:34,744 --> 00:22:36,964
-I told them my name was Trish.
-What? [laughs]

477
00:22:37,007 --> 00:22:39,314
Well, remember when
I was in that hit and run

478
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,663
-and that lady passed?
-Uh-huh.

479
00:22:40,707 --> 00:22:42,099
-Her name was Trish. Yeah.
-Really?

480
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:44,101
[Barb] Trish loses one of her
ears in a twister,

481
00:22:44,145 --> 00:22:46,277
-but not her hearing.
-She's a storm chaser.

482
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:47,931
Her mom doesn't want her to be.

483
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:49,716
-Their relationship is tough.
-Hmm.

484
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:52,022
Trish always wanted to be
a portrait photographer.

485
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:54,416
She loves people.
She would always say,

486
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,679
"A person's face says
a lot about how they look."

487
00:22:56,723 --> 00:22:58,159
-Oh, that's beautiful.
-Yeah.

488
00:22:58,202 --> 00:22:59,378
[Star] Okay.

489
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:00,901
-Trish's favorite number?
-[both] Four.

490
00:23:00,944 --> 00:23:02,642
-Her favorite animal?
-[both] Hen!

491
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:04,426
-Trish's favorite movie?
-Oh.

492
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,775
-Short Circuit.
-The Ring.

493
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:07,516
[both laugh]

494
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,476
And then she said,
"You know what, skin cancer?

495
00:23:11,302 --> 00:23:12,739
"You are not gonna take me.

496
00:23:14,044 --> 00:23:15,872
"Because I'm gonna take
my own life."

497
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:17,744
And she did.

498
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:22,226
She jumped off that cliff
near her house on the Cape.

499
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,706
Dove right into the water,

500
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:27,449
hitting every rock on the way.
[sniffles]

501
00:23:27,493 --> 00:23:31,061
And now there's a beautiful
spirit out there in the ocean.

502
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:33,847
And you know what her name is?

503
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:39,287
[both] It's Trish.

504
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:42,464

1188
00:55:56,091 --> 00:55:58,572
At my new school,
everyone made fun of me

1189
00:55:58,616 --> 00:56:00,182
because of the way
that I looked.

1190
00:56:00,226 --> 00:56:01,532
They would call me names like...

1191
00:56:01,575 --> 00:56:02,707
-pale girl...
-Pale girl.

1192
00:56:03,011 --> 00:56:04,796
-[Dr. Lady] ...white devil...
-White devil.

1193
00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:06,537
-[Dr. Lady] ...and asshole.
-Asshole.

1194
00:56:07,146 --> 00:56:09,366
[Dr. Lady]
I finally made one friend.

1195
00:56:09,409 --> 00:56:11,716
Her name was Maria Margolis.

1196
00:56:12,978 --> 00:56:14,936
She would stay inside with me.

1197
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:17,461
We would read
and create inventions,

1198
00:56:17,504 --> 00:56:18,897
cook food from her culture.

1199
00:56:19,506 --> 00:56:21,943
Then one day as we were walking to hercasa,

1200
00:56:21,987 --> 00:56:23,554
through the Vista Del Mar
swamps,

1201
00:56:25,556 --> 00:56:28,385
an alligator jumped out
of the water and ate Maria

1202
00:56:28,428 --> 00:56:30,822
-right in front of me.
-[Maria screaming]

1203
00:56:30,865 --> 00:56:32,389
Really gobbled her up.

1204
00:56:34,826 --> 00:56:36,741
She was my last friend.

1205
00:56:37,655 --> 00:56:39,787
Years later,
my father convinced me

1206
00:56:39,831 --> 00:56:43,835
to go to Vista Del Mar's
annual Seafood Jam.

1207
00:56:44,444 --> 00:56:46,577
I remember looking up
on the stage

1208
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,405
at the four young pretty girls.

1209
00:56:48,927 --> 00:56:51,582
One of them about to be crowned
the new Shrimp Queen.

1210
00:56:53,018 --> 00:56:54,454
And then all of a sudden...

1211
00:56:55,194 --> 00:56:56,761
a group of popular girls

1212
00:56:56,804 --> 00:56:58,763
from my school
pushed me on to the stage...

1213
00:56:58,806 --> 00:57:00,242
[laughter]

1214
00:57:00,286 --> 00:57:03,507
...ripping my hat off, replacing it with a fake crown.

1215
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:05,073
-No. No.
-[Dr. Lady] Father was trying

1216
00:57:05,117 --> 00:57:07,075
to get to the front,
but he couldn't

1217
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:08,773
before the elderly mayor
mistook me

1218
00:57:08,816 --> 00:57:11,602
for the actual Shrimp Queen and proceeded with the tradition.

1219
00:57:12,341 --> 00:57:14,431
He shoved me
into the human cannon.

1220
00:57:15,301 --> 00:57:20,306
Then one of the girls turned the dial all the way up.

1221
00:57:20,349 --> 00:57:22,090


1222
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:24,136
[crowd cheering]

1223
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:25,659
[Dr. Lady] As I rocketed
through the air,

1224
00:57:25,703 --> 00:57:28,227
the force of the wind
ripped off all of my clothes.

1225
00:57:28,836 --> 00:57:30,621
And I landed in the water...

1226
00:57:30,664 --> 00:57:32,013
of a pool...

1227
00:57:33,014 --> 00:57:35,321
-of a Disney Cruise Ship.
-[ship horn blowing]

1228
00:57:35,364 --> 00:57:38,019
[Dr. Lady] And there I was,
a laughing stock.

1229
00:57:38,063 --> 00:57:41,762
Bobbing in the water like
a ball of fresh mozzarella.

1230
00:57:41,806 --> 00:57:43,242
[laughter]

1231
00:57:43,285 --> 00:57:45,331
From all the guilt
and the stress,

1232
00:57:45,374 --> 00:57:47,507
my poor father
suffered a heart attack.

1233
00:57:48,073 --> 00:57:50,205
And my mother abandoned me
to reinvent herself

1234
00:57:50,249 --> 00:57:53,295
in Palm Springs.
And after all that,

1235
00:57:53,339 --> 00:57:55,080
I knew someday,

1236
00:57:56,211 --> 00:57:58,866
I would get revenge
on that small town.

1237
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,130
And everyone
that chose to live in it.

1238
00:58:03,305 --> 00:58:08,441
That dreadful town
that ruined my life

1239
00:58:09,703 --> 00:58:13,141
and cost me everything.

1240
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:17,929
I think your feelings are valid
and this is the only answer.

1241
00:58:17,972 --> 00:58:19,060
Thank you, Yoyo.

1242
00:58:19,365 --> 00:58:21,323
But we have to get another

-[cell phone rings]

1526
01:11:57,748 --> 01:11:58,879
That's my cell phone.

1527
01:11:58,923 --> 01:12:00,664
-Oh. Phew!
-Yeah.

1528
01:12:02,230 --> 01:12:05,233
It's work.
I should probably take this.

1529
01:12:05,277 --> 01:12:06,278
Okay.

1530
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:07,758
See each other soon?

1531
01:12:08,193 --> 01:12:09,281
-Okay.
-Star.

1532
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,761
Yeah?

1533
01:12:10,804 --> 01:12:12,110
I've never been this happy.

1534
01:12:12,458 --> 01:12:13,459
Really?

1535
01:12:14,242 --> 01:12:15,243
Oh.

1536
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:17,245
-[mumbling] Musical.
-What?

1537
01:12:17,637 --> 01:12:22,338
Uh-uh. I've gonna be...
[chuckles, mumbles]

1538
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,948
-I didn't get it.
-[chuckles]

1539
01:12:23,991 --> 01:12:25,950
I'm gonna be-- Yeah.
[chuckles]

1540
01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:29,475
Okay.
[mumbles, chuckles]

1541
01:12:30,128 --> 01:12:31,303
Hmm?

1542
01:12:33,305 --> 01:12:34,523
[elevator door dings]

1543
01:12:39,746 --> 01:12:41,661
-[elevator door dings]
-[dramatic music playing]

1544
01:12:41,705 --> 01:12:43,010
[panting]

1545
01:12:44,882 --> 01:12:45,883
Star.

1546
01:12:48,014 --> 01:12:50,670
[Edgar] Well, I don't know
how much clearer I can be.

1547
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,632
I've changed my mind.

1548
01:12:55,675 --> 01:12:57,155
I see now, you've been using me.

1549
01:12:57,198 --> 01:12:59,462
[Dr. Lady]
Edgar, don't be silly.

1550
01:12:59,505 --> 01:13:00,898
We're almost at
the finish line.

1551
01:13:00,941 --> 01:13:04,075
And you and I can be official.

1552
01:13:04,335 --> 01:13:05,598
Don't even try.

1553
01:13:05,642 --> 01:13:07,600
You know,
I've figured it all out.

1554
01:13:07,644 --> 01:13:09,602
You pretended to loved me.

1555
01:13:09,646 --> 01:13:11,169
You made me a bunch of promises

1556
01:13:11,212 --> 01:13:12,562
so that I would come down here

1557
01:13:12,605 --> 01:13:14,564
and place the receiver
on the stage,

1558
01:13:14,607 --> 01:13:16,522
in the middle
of the Seafood Jam party,

1559
01:13:16,566 --> 01:13:18,437
that will attract
thousands of deadly mosquitoes

1560
01:13:18,481 --> 01:13:20,439
that are gonna kill
thousands of people.

1561
01:13:20,483 --> 01:13:22,049
[woman] Excuse me.

1562
01:13:22,093 --> 01:13:25,618
Did you get that leaf and pearl
necklace down by the boardwalk?

1563
01:13:25,662 --> 01:13:29,230
[whispering] Oh, yes.
I got it at Baleafy Ornate.

1564
01:13:29,273 --> 01:13:30,580
I'm sorry. What?

1565
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:33,017
-Baleafy Ornate.
-What?

1566
01:13:33,059 --> 01:13:35,454
And not that you care,
but I have met someone.

1567
01:13:35,498 --> 01:13:38,544
And unlike you, I know-- I know
what real love feels like,

1568
01:13:38,588 --> 01:13:40,677
and it is not
how you've treated me.

1569
01:13:41,416 --> 01:13:44,898
-It feels amazing and special.
-[Dr. Lady] Oh, Edgar,

1570
01:13:44,942 --> 01:13:47,248
I really hate to be the one
to tell you this.

1571
01:13:47,291 --> 01:13:48,815
You know, you-- your girlfriend

1572
01:13:48,859 --> 01:13:51,209
and her little partner,
the ones with the fluffy hair

1573
01:13:51,252 --> 01:13:53,864
-and the culottes.
-How do you know about them?

1574
01:13:53,907 --> 01:13:57,476
Their spies, Edgar. They're not
who they say they are

1575
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,434
and they've been playing you
all along.

1576
01:14:00,610 --> 01:14:02,481
-You're lying.
-[Dr. Lady] I wish I was.

1577
01:14:02,525 --> 01:14:03,439
Luckily,

1578
01:14:03,787 --> 01:14:06,224
I have some inside sources
at their agency.

1579
01:14:06,267 --> 01:14:07,746
What agency?
Who do they work for?

1580
01:14:08,052 --> 01:14:12,404
-The H...P... V.

1581
01:14:13,623 --> 01:14:15,625
-Sounds familiar.
-[Dr. Lady] Check your emails.

1582
01:14:15,668 --> 01:14:17,975
We've intercepted some
of the photos they've sent back

1583
01:14:18,018 --> 01:14:19,585
to headquarters.
I think you'll find

1584
01:14:19,629 --> 01:14:21,544
there are some interesting ones.

1585
01:14:24,503 --> 01:14:27,027
It all looks very fun.

1586
01:14:27,071 --> 01:14:29,202
-Star, no.
-Oh,

1587
01:14:29,246 --> 01:14:30,422
I know, Edgar,

1588
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:33,643
this must hurt that she
lied to you about loving you.

1589
01:14:34,121 --> 01:14:35,514
And I don't blame you

1590
01:14:35,558 --> 01:14:37,429
about running into the arms
of another woman.

1591
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,648
I hadn't been there for you,
and I'm so sorry.

1592
01:14:39,692 --> 01:14:43,696
Let's get away after this,
find a little place in Portugal

1593
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:45,742
where we can be official.

1594
01:14:45,785 --> 01:14:48,571
I got the necklace
at Baleafy Ornate.

1595
01:14:48,614 --> 01:14:51,138
-I cannot hear you. What?
-Baleafy Ornate.

1596
01:14:51,182 --> 01:14:52,139
It's called Baleafy Ornate!

1597
01:14:52,575 --> 01:14:54,402
It sells everything bay leaf!

1598
01:14:54,446 --> 01:14:57,275
It's a play on words!
My God, lady!

1599
01:14:57,318 --> 01:14:58,318
Okay.

1600
01:15:00,321 --> 01:15:01,627
-Oh.
-[glass shatters]

1601
01:15:04,717 --> 01:15:05,892
[Barb] Sorry I yelled.

1602
01:15:06,414 --> 01:15:07,285
-Sorry.
-Shit!

1603
01:15:07,764 --> 01:15:08,852
What shit?

1604
01:15:09,156 --> 01:15:10,984
It was Barb, the other one.
She was listening

1605
01:15:11,028 --> 01:15:12,725
at the door.
Damn, they're good...

1606
01:15:12,769 --> 01:15:14,901
spies.
I can't believe this.

1607
01:15:15,423 --> 01:15:18,601
Edgar, you listen to me
and you listen to me good.

1608
01:15:27,392 --> 01:15:29,263
-Edgar?
-I'm listening.

1609
01:15:29,307 --> 01:15:31,222
Okay. I just wanted to make
sure you could still hear me.

1610
01:15:31,264 --> 01:15:33,093
Sometimes
the connection in here...

1611
01:15:33,137 --> 01:15:34,050
Anyway,

1612
01:15:34,442 --> 01:15:37,968
I need you to find those two.
And kill them.

1613
01:15:41,406 --> 01:15:42,407
Star.

1614
01:15:43,755 --> 01:15:44,757
Star!

1615
01:15:46,454 --> 01:15:47,891
[coughs]

1616
01:15:47,934 --> 01:15:50,110
Oh, don't bother
pretending to be sick anymore.

1617
01:15:50,154 --> 01:15:51,938
I know all
about your little lies.

1618
01:15:51,982 --> 01:15:54,027
And I know all
about you and Edgar.

1619
01:15:54,071 --> 01:15:56,116
And guess what?
He's a bad man!

1620
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,465
And he's gonna do
something terrible!

1621
01:15:57,857 --> 01:15:59,076
-What?
-He's following orders

1622
01:15:59,511 --> 01:16:00,817
from someone. I overheard him
on the phone with his boss.

1623
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:01,818
His boss from Clamco?

1624
01:16:02,121 --> 01:16:04,342
No, Star! He lied to you!
He's a killer!

1625
01:16:04,385 --> 01:16:05,430
A killer?

1626
01:16:06,213 --> 01:16:09,652
But, Barb, what you're saying
is ridiculous.

1627
01:16:09,695 --> 01:16:11,523
There's nothing ridiculous
about what I'm saying.

1628
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,438
Edgar put a receiver
in the middle of the Seafood Jam

1629
01:16:13,481 --> 01:16:15,614
that'll trigger deadly mosquitos
that'll fly into the crowd

1630
01:16:15,657 --> 01:16:17,616
and sting everybody
with their killer tails!

1631
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:20,924
Why are you doing this?
[gasps]

1632
01:16:22,882 --> 01:16:25,189
-You're making this all up!
-Oh, come on.

1633
01:16:25,232 --> 01:16:26,364
I cannot believe you.

1634
01:16:26,407 --> 01:16:29,148
You're mad
because Edgar picked me!

1635
01:16:29,193 --> 01:16:31,282
Get me a break.
I am not mad about that.

1636
01:16:31,325 --> 01:16:33,153
And I am not making it up.

1637
01:16:33,806 --> 01:16:35,939
-I'm calling the police.
-[scoffs] Fine.

1638
01:16:37,984 --> 01:16:39,725
Jeff's Banana Boats?

1639
01:16:40,639 --> 01:16:41,814
I didn't go through with it.

1640
01:16:41,858 --> 01:16:43,686
While I was lying here
in my deathbed?

1641
01:16:43,728 --> 01:16:45,339
-You weren't sick.
-You didn't know that?

1642
01:16:45,383 --> 01:16:47,472
-Because you lied.
-So did you.

1643
01:16:47,514 --> 01:16:48,647
[both scoff]

1644
01:16:51,344 --> 01:16:52,956
I should have gone
on that banana boat.

1645
01:16:52,999 --> 01:16:54,566
-I wish I did.
-Oh.

1646
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:57,700
[Edgar] I hear it's a real
tit flapper.

1647
01:16:58,570 --> 01:16:59,440
[gasps]

1648
01:17:01,268 --> 01:17:02,922
[dispatcher]
911, what's your emergency?

1649
01:17:02,966 --> 01:17:04,315
Uh, never mind.

1650
01:17:04,358 --> 01:17:08,885
I thought I saw a burglar
but it was a... turtle.

1651
01:17:10,495 --> 01:17:14,630
[suspenseful music playing]

1652
01:17:21,724 --> 01:17:23,377
[Dr. Lady] Yoyo, where are you?

1653
01:17:23,421 --> 01:17:24,987
The mosquitoes are almost there.

1654
01:17:25,423 --> 01:17:26,337
Goodie.

1655
01:17:27,032 --> 01:17:29,818
And, remember, don't keep
the steering wheel too straight.

1656
01:17:29,862 --> 01:17:32,255
Lots of tiny movements,
left to right.

1657
01:17:34,954 --> 01:17:37,087
[groans] I wish we wouldn't
have had these ropes.

1658
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:38,784
-[grunting]
-Stop squirming.

1659
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:41,831
Believe me this is better.
I'm supposed to kill you guys.

1660
01:17:41,874 --> 01:17:44,660
What? Who said to kill us?
Edgar, what is happening?

1661
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:47,358
-Ow! Our bracelets are sharp.
-These bracelets really hurt.

1662
01:17:47,401 --> 01:17:49,403
-They're sharp. I know.
-They're sharp, be careful

1663
01:17:49,447 --> 01:17:51,666
with that. And we-- [groans]

1664
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:54,278
Edgar, you lied to me!

1665
01:17:54,321 --> 01:17:57,368
You should talk.
I know all about the HPV.

1666
01:17:58,761 --> 01:18:00,545
Okay. Look, I was gonna
tell you about that.

1667
01:18:00,588 --> 01:18:03,026
A lot of people have it.
I mean, you probably have it.

1668
01:18:03,068 --> 01:18:05,332
What?
Stop trying to confuse me.

1669
01:18:06,029 --> 01:18:08,466
Star, I thought
you we're different.

1670
01:18:08,509 --> 01:18:09,728
Edgar.

1671
01:18:09,772 --> 01:18:11,295
Don't let him
bamboozled you, Star.

1672
01:18:11,338 --> 01:18:12,949
He's a murderer.
Tell her.

1673
01:18:12,992 --> 01:18:15,734
-You're not who you say you are.
-You're not who you say you are.

1674
01:18:15,778 --> 01:18:18,344
We are who we are.
We're Barb and Star.

1675
01:18:18,389 --> 01:18:21,478
Unlike you, Edgar,
you big effin' liar.

1676
01:18:21,522 --> 01:18:22,523
Huh?

1677
01:18:22,567 --> 01:18:24,395
God, I knew this wasn't real.

1678
01:18:24,438 --> 01:18:26,397
And no one could ever
love me again.

1679
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,573
God, I'm in so much grief
right now.

1680
01:18:28,616 --> 01:18:31,271
-Goodbye, ladies.
-[Barb] Edgar, please wait.

1681
01:18:31,315 --> 01:18:32,969
A lot of innocent people
will die.

1682
01:18:33,012 --> 01:18:34,753
[Star] At least tell us why?

1683
01:18:34,797 --> 01:18:37,451
Why you would ever be involved
with such an awful thing?

1684
01:18:40,759 --> 01:18:44,154
[sighs] Fine.
I'll tell you.

1685
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:49,942
-Oh, he pulled up a chair.
-It's gonna be a long story.

1686
01:18:49,986 --> 01:18:52,118
When I was seven years old
my father

1687
01:18:52,162 --> 01:18:53,859
left my mom,
my eleven sisters, and me.

1688
01:18:53,903 --> 01:18:56,296
-[whispering] Use your bracelet.
-[Edgar] I was the oldest,

1689
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:57,820
so I had to support us.

1690
01:18:58,821 --> 01:19:00,213
We had no money.

1691
01:19:01,519 --> 01:19:04,348
I did odd jobs.
I built lawnmowers for Honda.

1692
01:19:04,391 --> 01:19:06,219
I even tried to sell my poop
to farmers

1693
01:19:06,263 --> 01:19:08,004
saying that it was fertilizer.

1694
01:19:09,179 --> 01:19:10,571
It was never enough.

1695
01:19:11,181 --> 01:19:13,618
One day,
a woman wearing a cape

1696
01:19:13,661 --> 01:19:16,752
and bag over her head
put $50 in my cup.

1697
01:19:18,492 --> 01:19:20,407
-Oh. Hmm.
-Oh. Mm-hmm.

1698
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:23,846
She started to seduce me

1699
01:19:23,889 --> 01:19:25,456
as the errands
became more criminal.

1700
01:19:25,499 --> 01:19:27,458
-[grunting]
-I fell under her spell.

1701
01:19:28,111 --> 01:19:29,460
I thought it was love.

1702
01:19:32,332 --> 01:19:33,943
I would do anything for her.

1703
01:19:33,986 --> 01:19:36,249
We'd always talk
about this particular plan.

1704
01:19:36,293 --> 01:19:37,424
Her life's work.

1705
01:19:38,295 --> 01:19:39,818
When it came time to help her,
I said, Yes.

1706
01:19:40,166 --> 01:19:41,777
Of course,
I had my reservations,

1707
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:42,821
but...

1708
01:19:43,866 --> 01:19:47,391
But she said when it was over,
we could be an official couple.

1709
01:19:47,434 --> 01:19:50,481
That's all I wanted at the time.
That's all I've ever wanted.

1710
01:19:51,699 --> 01:19:53,309
People do crazy things for love.

1711
01:19:54,398 --> 01:19:56,530
Yeah, but, I mean,
killing people, that's...

1712
01:19:56,574 --> 01:19:57,793
that's a lot.

1713
01:19:58,228 --> 01:20:00,839
Yeah, it's a lot of people.
That's... that's a little crazy.

1714
01:20:00,883 --> 01:20:03,320
Is it? Wouldn't you
have done it for Carmine?

1715
01:20:05,322 --> 01:20:06,627
And you for Ron?

1716
01:20:09,021 --> 01:20:10,588
Wait.

1717
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:12,851
How do you know about Barb's
dead husband, Ron Quicksilver?

1718
01:20:12,895 --> 01:20:14,592
-Wait.
-She told me

1719
01:20:14,635 --> 01:20:16,072
-when she came to see me.
-Oh.

1720
01:20:16,115 --> 01:20:17,900
That night on the foot bridge
right before you did.

1721
01:20:17,943 --> 01:20:20,076
Well, you weren't supposed
to say that.

1722
01:20:20,598 --> 01:20:23,601
Goodbye, Barb and Star.
Whoever you are.

1723
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:30,085
Okay. We can talk about it.
Let's just talk about it.

1724
01:20:30,129 --> 01:20:32,436
It's-- It was a long time ago.
A long time.

1725
01:20:33,132 --> 01:20:35,134
[MC]
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome

1726
01:20:35,178 --> 01:20:37,920
to the 49th Annual Seafood Jam,

1727
01:20:38,616 --> 01:20:40,270
where the clams are hot

1728
01:20:40,313 --> 01:20:42,880
and the crowd
is on the older side.

1729
01:20:42,925 --> 01:20:44,840
[indistinct chatter]

1730
01:20:46,102 --> 01:20:47,407
People are gonna die!

1731
01:20:47,451 --> 01:20:49,061
-We have to find Edgar!
-You're right,

1732
01:20:49,105 --> 01:20:51,368
but by me agreeing with you
about having to stop Edgar,

1733
01:20:51,411 --> 01:20:53,239
I don't agree about
stopping being mad at you.

1734
01:20:53,282 --> 01:20:55,198
We agree to go.
But I want you to know

1735
01:20:55,241 --> 01:20:56,895
that I'm frustrated and hurt

1736
01:20:56,939 --> 01:20:58,549
and I'm really
freaking pissed off.

1737
01:20:58,592 --> 01:21:00,856
I'm freaking pissed off too.
It's not that I'm copying you

1738
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:01,987
-It's because I am.
-Fine.

1739
01:21:06,469 --> 01:21:07,688
Hello.

1740
01:21:07,732 --> 01:21:08,776
[both] Hi.

1741
01:21:12,519 --> 01:21:14,434
[dramatic music playing]

1742
01:21:16,132 --> 01:21:17,829
[seagulls calling]

1743
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:24,749
[both gasp]

1744
01:21:26,794 --> 01:21:28,927
-[Dr. Lady] Oh, hello.
-[both gasp]

1745
01:21:29,406 --> 01:21:31,321
Enjoying your vacation?

1746
01:21:32,496 --> 01:21:33,932
-Well, um...
-Oh, um...

1747
01:21:33,976 --> 01:21:36,326
-It started out fine.
-...supposed to be a friend trip

1748
01:21:36,369 --> 01:21:37,980
-We got here and we were...
-And we got here.

1749
01:21:38,023 --> 01:21:39,546
-No, I didn't--
-[Barb overlapping]

1750
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:41,940
The first night, we went out
to loosen up a little bit.

1751
01:21:41,984 --> 01:21:44,594
That's when we meet Edgar,
which was not a good idea.

1752
01:21:44,638 --> 01:21:47,076
Edgar and I started hanging out,
and I was lying to Barb,

1753
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:49,034
-which I shouldn't have done...
-I met Tommy Bahama.

1754
01:21:49,077 --> 01:21:50,993
-You met Tommy Bahama? Anyway...
-Then we discovered--

1755
01:21:51,036 --> 01:21:52,081
Enough!

1756
01:21:52,516 --> 01:21:56,302
I have set up one last excursion
for the two of you.

1757
01:21:56,346 --> 01:21:58,652
[snickers]
It's more of a game, really.

1758
01:21:58,696 --> 01:22:04,005
The rules are
you get to choose how you die.

1759
01:22:04,049 --> 01:22:05,181
-What?
-What?

1760
01:22:05,616 --> 01:22:07,400
You can either
jump off that cliff behind you

1761
01:22:07,443 --> 01:22:09,707
hitting every sharp rock
on the way down,

1762
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:11,535
ripping your skin
at every bounce

1763
01:22:11,577 --> 01:22:14,581
or you can stay here
and have dinner

1764
01:22:15,452 --> 01:22:18,846
with, um... my new friends.

1765
01:22:18,889 --> 01:22:20,370
-[growling]
-There are two

1766
01:22:20,674 --> 01:22:24,330
very hungry hot alligators
in those crates.

1767
01:22:24,374 --> 01:22:25,592
[both] Alligators?

1768
01:22:25,636 --> 01:22:27,159
-Oh, please. No, no...
-No, no, no...

1769
01:22:27,202 --> 01:22:30,641
That's what you get
for getting in my way.

1770
01:22:31,684 --> 01:22:36,125
Now, you can kiss your
middle-aged, flat, wide asses...

1771
01:22:36,907 --> 01:22:37,778
[both gasp]

1772
01:22:39,519 --> 01:22:40,693
...goodbye.

1773
01:22:40,737 --> 01:22:41,869
-Please wait!
-Oh, my gosh!

1774
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:44,046
[Star] No, no, no, no, no, no.

1775
01:22:46,744 --> 01:22:48,964
Thanks a lot, Star, for making
me come on this trip.

1776
01:22:49,007 --> 01:22:50,704
Now, we're gonna die
just like I predicted.

1777
01:22:50,748 --> 01:22:52,706
Oh, will you just stop
your complaining for once?

1778
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:54,056
Seems to me like you've been
having the time

1779
01:22:54,099 --> 01:22:55,927
-of your life here.
-Oh, I sure have.

1780
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:58,886
-[growling]
-[both whimpering]

1781
01:22:59,148 --> 01:23:02,412
[suspenseful music playing]

1782
01:23:10,594 --> 01:23:12,726
When we get to heaven, we're not
living with each other,

1783
01:23:12,770 --> 01:23:14,511
and we're not running around
playing harps

1784
01:23:14,554 --> 01:23:15,512
in our halos and wings!

1785
01:23:16,165 --> 01:23:18,471
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm not even
gonna look for you up there!

1786
01:23:18,514 --> 01:23:20,517
I'm gonna find the farthest
cloud away from you.

1787
01:23:20,559 --> 01:23:22,214
And I'm gonna find Betsy Ross!

1788
01:23:22,258 --> 01:23:24,129
And I'm gonna be
best friends with her.

1789
01:23:24,173 --> 01:23:26,349
And we're gonna ignore you
at all the parties.

1790
01:23:27,785 --> 01:23:29,830
[whimpering]

1791
01:23:31,136 --> 01:23:33,138
I guess we're gonna die
on bad terms.

1792
01:23:33,182 --> 01:23:34,487
I guess you're right.

1793
01:23:35,271 --> 01:23:37,751
[dramatic music playing]

1794
01:23:43,105 --> 01:23:44,628
[screaming]

1795
01:23:47,630 --> 01:23:48,980
[parachute flapping]

1796
01:23:50,416 --> 01:23:52,331
[dramatic music playing]

1797
01:23:54,377 --> 01:23:56,553
-Our culottes!
-They're natural parachutes.

1798
01:24:09,305 --> 01:24:11,437
[gasping]

1799
01:24:13,612 --> 01:24:15,267
I'm so sorry. Oh!

1800
01:24:15,311 --> 01:24:17,226
So sorry. Lying to you
was the hardest thing

1801
01:24:17,269 --> 01:24:18,443
I've ever had to do.

1802
01:24:18,487 --> 01:24:20,228
-I'm sorry too.
-No. This is all my fault.

1803
01:24:20,272 --> 01:24:21,925
None of this will be happening
if I hadn't suggested

1804
01:24:21,969 --> 01:24:23,580
coming on this trip
in the first place.

1805
01:24:23,623 --> 01:24:25,973
Are you kidding? I've had
the time of my life here.

1806
01:24:26,017 --> 01:24:27,714
I've done things
I never thought I would do.

1807
01:24:27,758 --> 01:24:29,716
-I went in the ocean, Star.
-[gasps]

1808
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,936
-And I got my labia pierced.
-What?

1809
01:24:31,978 --> 01:24:34,112
I took it out.
Immediately took it out.

1810
01:24:34,156 --> 01:24:36,201
I should never have spent
all that time with Edgar

1811
01:24:36,245 --> 01:24:38,073
behind your back.
I should've told you.

1812
01:24:38,116 --> 01:24:40,597
I know you're only
trying to protect my feelings.

1813
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:42,294
And I'm so happy you found love.

1814
01:24:42,338 --> 01:24:43,817
[giggling]

1815
01:24:45,036 --> 01:24:47,473
I mean, it's unfortunate that
he turned out to be a conman

1816
01:24:47,517 --> 01:24:50,128
-and a mass murderer.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1817
01:24:50,172 --> 01:24:51,303
[both gasp]

1818
01:24:51,347 --> 01:24:52,434
-Oh, my God.
-[Star] Edgar.

1819
01:24:52,478 --> 01:24:54,175
-[both] We have to stop him.
-Go!

1820
01:24:55,307 --> 01:24:58,223
[MC] The Seafood Jam
just keeps on jamming!

1821
01:24:58,832 --> 01:25:00,050
[Dr. Lady] Nice view.

1822
01:25:02,835 --> 01:25:04,360
-[slurping]
-What are you doing here?

1823
01:25:05,491 --> 01:25:07,014
Cleaning up your mess.

1824
01:25:07,058 --> 01:25:08,581
Seems like
you can't follow through

1825
01:25:08,625 --> 01:25:10,627
with anything these days.
For example,

1826
01:25:10,670 --> 01:25:12,716
getting rid
of your little friends.

1827
01:25:14,326 --> 01:25:17,503
-I did. I-I mean, I--
-Oh, it's okay, Edgar.

1828
01:25:17,547 --> 01:25:20,115
I took care of them myself.

1829
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:21,028
What?

1830
01:25:21,638 --> 01:25:23,596
-What did you do?
-Let's just say

1831
01:25:23,639 --> 01:25:25,946
there are a couple
of alligators out there

1832
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:29,298
with bellies full of... them.

1833
01:25:30,299 --> 01:25:33,344
Oh, don't be so sad, Edgar.

1834
01:25:33,389 --> 01:25:36,566
Those two were just a couple
of pathetic Stellas

1835
01:25:36,609 --> 01:25:38,394
trying to get their groove back.

1836
01:25:39,003 --> 01:25:40,439
But they were spies, right?

1837
01:25:41,397 --> 01:25:43,964
I mean, you told me
that they were spies.

1838
01:25:44,008 --> 01:25:46,532
Sorry. I just said that
to get what I want.

1839
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:48,665
Sometimes I do that,

1840
01:25:48,708 --> 01:25:52,234
but I'll work on it
on our relationship, I promise.

1841
01:25:52,712 --> 01:25:55,193
That is still what you want,
isn't it, Edgar?

1842
01:25:55,759 --> 01:25:56,803
To be official?

1843
01:25:58,327 --> 01:26:01,939
And, um, the receiver
is in position?

1844
01:26:01,982 --> 01:26:03,767
It's on the stage.

1845
01:26:03,809 --> 01:26:05,943
-The microchip is inside.
-Good.

1846
01:26:11,905 --> 01:26:13,037
This is it.

1847
01:26:13,690 --> 01:26:15,257
My moment of glory.

1848
01:26:16,867 --> 01:26:21,611
Goodbye, Vista Del Mar.
You stupid place

1849
01:26:21,654 --> 01:26:23,003
full of dummies.

1850
01:26:26,746 --> 01:26:28,443
[detonator beeping]

1851
01:26:30,663 --> 01:26:32,448
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1852
01:26:33,144 --> 01:26:34,450
Shit.

1853
01:26:36,974 --> 01:26:39,193
[dramatic music playing]

1854
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:44,590
-Shit.
-[MC] Of course, shrimp

1855
01:26:44,634 --> 01:26:47,289
is the most popular fish
in America.

1856
01:26:47,332 --> 01:26:48,855
Let's introduce our finalists.

1857
01:26:49,726 --> 01:26:50,814
[Edgar] Star?

1858
01:26:50,857 --> 01:26:52,294
-[Star] Sorry.
