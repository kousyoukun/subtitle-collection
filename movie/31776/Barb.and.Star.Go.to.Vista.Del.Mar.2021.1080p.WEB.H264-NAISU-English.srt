1
00:01:06,385 --> 00:01:10,215
# Shadows falling baby

2
00:01:10,259 --> 00:01:12,043
# We stand alone

3
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:15,655
# Out on the street
Anybody you meet #

4
00:01:15,699 --> 00:01:18,484
# Got a heartache
Of their own #

5
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:20,617
# It oughta be illegal

6
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,664
# Make it a crime
To be lonely or sad #

7
00:01:25,448 --> 00:01:27,798
# It oughta be illegal

8
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:32,803
# You got a reason for livin'
You battle on #

9
00:01:32,846 --> 00:01:35,197
# With the love
You're livin' on #

10
00:01:35,675 --> 00:01:38,591
# You gotta be mine #

11
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,203
# We take it away #

12
00:01:41,942 --> 00:01:47,644
# It's gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time #

13
00:01:56,348 --> 00:01:57,915
# And we got nothing to be

14
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:01,614
# Guilty of our love

15
00:02:01,962 --> 00:02:07,098
# Will climb any mountain
Near or far we are #

16
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:11,798
# And we never let it end

17
00:02:11,842 --> 00:02:14,888
# We are devotion

18
00:02:14,932 --> 00:02:17,717
# And we got nothing
To be sorry for #

19
00:02:18,196 --> 00:02:23,027
# Our love is one
In a million eyes #

20
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,838
Good morning, Yoyo.

21
00:02:51,882 --> 00:02:53,449
Morning, Gene.
Has it started?

22
00:02:53,492 --> 00:02:55,625
They're waiting for you,sir. You better get changed.

23
00:02:55,668 --> 00:02:56,626
Okey-dokey.

24
00:03:46,763 --> 00:03:49,156
Would anyone like a drink
before we get started?

25
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,595
No, thank you.

26
00:03:52,638 --> 00:03:54,901
Well, I'm going to make myself..

27
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:57,730
a "suicide."

28
00:04:07,697 --> 00:04:10,656
Just a little bit of root beer,
traditional cola,

29
00:04:11,091 --> 00:04:12,441
just a touch
of lemon-lime spritz,

30
00:04:13,311 --> 00:04:16,401
orange up, and my
secret ingredient...

31
00:04:18,055 --> 00:04:20,318
just a dash of lemon-infused
iced tea.

32
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:24,017
I like the extra bite.

33
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:31,721
It's perfect.

34
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:35,681
Is it ready?

35
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:37,117
Finally, yes.

36
00:04:37,553 --> 00:04:39,511
After years of work,
I have developed

37
00:04:39,555 --> 00:04:41,818
genetically modified mosquitos

38
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:43,907
and a way to control them.

39
00:04:47,563 --> 00:04:51,044
This remote here, activates
that receiver under the cow,

40
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:53,656
releasing a signal attracting
the mosquitos.

41
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,788
These are not just
itchy mosquito bites.

42
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,139
One sting will kill
a large animal within minutes.

43
00:05:00,358 --> 00:05:03,317
So, hypothetically speaking,

44
00:05:03,361 --> 00:05:05,755
if the receiver was placed, say,

45
00:05:05,798 --> 00:05:09,019
in the middle of a small town,

46
00:05:09,062 --> 00:05:11,108
the mosquitoes
would then fly towards it

47
00:05:11,804 --> 00:05:14,546
stinging and killing everyone
in the town?

48
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,463
- Hypothetically.
- Well,

49
00:05:18,507 --> 00:05:21,423
given that we have
thousands of mosquitos,

50
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:23,599
we could kill
thousands of people

51
00:05:23,642 --> 00:05:25,688
but we don't
wanna do that, right?

52
00:05:27,124 --> 00:05:30,301
We're using these to kill
animals with rabies, right?

53
00:05:30,344 --> 00:05:31,998
In South Africa?

54
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:35,437
There was a problem with rabid
herds of animals? You said?

55
00:05:37,482 --> 00:05:39,353
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

56
00:05:39,397 --> 00:05:42,705
You cannot get away with this!
My house is full of evidence!

57
00:05:43,662 --> 00:05:44,837
Yoyo.

58
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,670
- Goodbye, Dr. Bradley.

59
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:09,819
Now, no one can stop me.

60
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:12,038
No one.

61
00:06:12,082 --> 00:06:12,952
# Let's go girls

62
00:06:16,695 --> 00:06:17,653
# Come on...

63
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:21,918
Whenever
I watch those movies

64
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:23,528
- where they're in the 1800s...
- Oh.

65
00:06:23,572 --> 00:06:25,487
I can't stop thinking,

66
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,054
did everybody just...
Gosh, I don't wanna be rude...

67
00:06:28,315 --> 00:06:29,534
- Stink?
- Yes.

68
00:06:29,578 --> 00:06:30,970
Yes, I know.
I think about it all the time.

69
00:06:31,014 --> 00:06:32,450
- They didn't have deodorant!
- No.

70
00:06:32,494 --> 00:06:34,104
They didn't have toilets,
didn't brush their teeth!

71
00:06:34,147 --> 00:06:35,148
- Everyone had yellow teeth.
- Yeah.

72
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:36,759
Yellow teeth was just
the regular color.

73
00:06:36,802 --> 00:06:38,021
- It was the norm.
- The regular color.

74
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,675
- Yes, everyone had it.

75
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:43,679
# No inhibitions
Make no conditions #

76
00:06:43,722 --> 00:06:46,508
# Get a little outta line...

77
00:06:46,812 --> 00:06:47,726
I had a dream

78
00:06:48,248 --> 00:06:49,859
that I made love with that man
on the Pringles can.

79
00:06:49,902 --> 00:06:52,165
- What flavor of Pringles was it?
- Plain. I like everything plain.

80
00:06:52,644 --> 00:06:53,863
- Plain Pringles are the best.
- Just plain.

81
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:54,864
- Yeah.
- You know who I always

82
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:57,388
- had a crush on? Mr. Peanut.
- Who? Oh, my gosh.

83
00:06:57,431 --> 00:06:59,129
- Something about him.
- But he's so smart.

84
00:06:59,172 --> 00:07:00,870
- He had that little monocle.
- And a top hat.

85
00:07:00,913 --> 00:07:03,089
- Love a man with a top hat.
- Me too.

86
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,832
# Oh, oh, oh
Go totally crazy... #

87
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:09,269
God, it's so funny to think
all the raccoons in the world

88
00:07:09,313 --> 00:07:10,488
- are sleeping right now.
- What?

89
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,882
Listen, I don't really know more
than what I've already said.

90
00:07:12,925 --> 00:07:15,275
And some of what I said I'm not
even sure I actually know.

91
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,103
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

92
00:07:17,756 --> 00:07:20,324
- Do you work here?
- Yes. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

93
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:23,066
Great! 'Cause we're interested
in this couch you're sitting on.

94
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:25,982
- Hmm, good. Okay.
- Um...

95
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:29,899
- Okay...
- Here's the thing.

96
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:31,857
- Um, okay.

97
00:07:32,728 --> 00:07:36,209
This couch is the floor model.
And it's the only one left.

98
00:07:36,253 --> 00:07:37,646
- I'm so sorry.
- So, I'm sorry.

99
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:39,430
- It's soiled up pretty badly.
- Is there a discount

100
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:41,084
- since it's the floor model?
- Oh.

101
00:07:41,824 --> 00:07:43,739
I'm sorry would you excuse us
just for one minute?

102
00:07:44,217 --> 00:07:45,523
Just a quick second.

103
00:07:48,221 --> 00:07:50,267
- Star.
- Barb, what are we gonna do?

104
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,877
- This is our couch.
- We've told each other

105
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:54,140
so many things on this couch.
Remember when you told me

106
00:07:54,184 --> 00:07:55,925
you were afraid
you were addicted to caramel?

107
00:07:55,968 --> 00:07:57,883
- Right here on this couch.
- Caramel squares.

108
00:07:57,927 --> 00:08:00,016
God, I'm glad that's over.
And it was on this couch

109
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:01,583
you told me my husband
was having an affair

110
00:08:01,626 --> 00:08:03,846
- with Dina Rankusio.
- That was so hard for me.

111
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:06,022
You're a good friend
for telling me. Some wouldn't.

112
00:08:06,065 --> 00:08:08,154
Well, I couldn't keep that in.
I would never lie to you.

113
00:08:08,198 --> 00:08:10,635
- I would never lie to you.
- Star.

114
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:12,289
Excuse me, uh, ladies?

115
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:15,466
Listen, the reason why
we're acting a little funny

116
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:18,730
about this couch is because
well, we love it.

117
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:20,906
It's the truth.

118
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,647
We sit on it every day.

119
00:08:22,691 --> 00:08:24,780
It's, um, it's our talking
couch, you know?

120
00:08:25,258 --> 00:08:29,262
So, um, you're telling us not
to buy the couch

121
00:08:29,306 --> 00:08:32,918
because you wanna sit on it?
At work?

122
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:35,573
- That's it. You get it. Yes.
- Yes. She gets it. Exactly.

123
00:08:35,617 --> 00:08:36,966
- That's exactly it.
- Thank you.

124
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:39,795
Thank you for helping us.
That was very helpful.

125
00:08:39,838 --> 00:08:41,448
Thank you so much.

126
00:08:41,492 --> 00:08:43,146
- That's so nice of you.
- Oh, my gosh.

127
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,278
- Okay. Look, that was close.
- That was the couch.

128
00:08:45,322 --> 00:08:47,672
- We should do something.
- We have to rip a hole...

129
00:08:47,716 --> 00:08:49,326
- Why don't we fart on it?
- Oh, yes. Let's fart.

130
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:51,284
- Let's fart right now.

131
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:53,025
Hi.

132
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:54,331
I called you both

133
00:08:54,374 --> 00:08:56,507
in here today because...

134
00:08:57,551 --> 00:09:00,380
Wait, Star are you even
supposed to be working today?

135
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:02,818
Oh, I always come in
when Barb works.

136
00:09:02,861 --> 00:09:05,168
She does the same. Don't worry,
you're not paying us double.

137
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,517
Wait. I thought you were
working today.

138
00:09:06,952 --> 00:09:08,127
No! I thought
you were the one working.

139
00:09:08,475 --> 00:09:10,260
- Gosh, that's so funny.

140
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:12,001
- It's not the first time...
- That this happened.

141
00:09:12,044 --> 00:09:13,306
Sometimes one of us
is on the schedule,

142
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,743
- we both come in.
- We just come in.

143
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:17,136
Alright. Look. This is very
difficult for me to do.

144
00:09:17,963 --> 00:09:20,444
But I need to tell you
that we're closing the store.

145
00:09:21,358 --> 00:09:23,012
- What?
- Oh, I think he means

146
00:09:23,055 --> 00:09:24,404
for renovations.
Oh my gosh.

147
00:09:24,883 --> 00:09:26,406
- Are we getting a juke box?
- Please tell me

148
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,712
we're getting that jukebox.

149
00:09:27,756 --> 00:09:29,845
No, please stop asking me
about that.

150
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:31,760
The store is closing for good.

151
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:34,066
Apparently,
Jennifer Convertibles

152
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,807
as a national chain

153
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:40,899
closed about seven months ago
and nobody bothered to tell us.

154
00:09:40,943 --> 00:09:42,771
- So, what does that mean?
- What does that mean?

155
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:44,860
I'm sorry,
I know you love it here.

156
00:09:44,903 --> 00:09:46,818
But the good news is that
the company

157
00:09:46,862 --> 00:09:48,515
- is giving you severance.
- No. Severance?

158
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,474
- We don't wanna be severanced.
- No! Please!

159
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:52,737
This job is our lives.
It's our purpose.

160
00:09:52,781 --> 00:09:54,347
Where are we
gonna host Thanksgiving?

161
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:55,609
Well, you can...

162
00:09:56,306 --> 00:09:59,570
Wait, you come in here
when the store is closed

163
00:09:59,613 --> 00:10:01,572
and host
your Thanksgiving dinners?

164
00:10:06,316 --> 00:10:07,404
No.

165
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,320
God I'm really upset.

166
00:10:10,363 --> 00:10:12,365
I can't believe we're not
gonna work here anymore.

167
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:14,759
I'm grieving. I think...
I think I'm really grieving.

168
00:10:14,803 --> 00:10:16,369
Me too, but you know what?

169
00:10:16,413 --> 00:10:18,676
We'll find another job.
This small town's full of places

170
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,722
looking to hire women
in their 40s.

171
00:10:20,765 --> 00:10:22,854
Yeah. That's the attitude!

172
00:10:23,681 --> 00:10:25,335
- We'll find something better.
- Yeah.

173
00:10:25,378 --> 00:10:28,338
I mean, we both
have high school degrees.

174
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:29,905
- Well, you do.
- Well, I don't.

175
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:31,863
- I thought you did.
- Well, I don't.

176
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:36,694
- Well, what can we do?
- Ladies!

177
00:10:36,738 --> 00:10:37,956
Hi!

178
00:10:38,478 --> 00:10:40,219
Mickey.

179
00:10:44,658 --> 00:10:46,835
- You look amazing.
- You look great.

180
00:10:46,878 --> 00:10:48,488
- Wow.
- Miguel and I just got back

181
00:10:48,532 --> 00:10:49,881
from vacation.

182
00:10:49,925 --> 00:10:52,492
My dermatologist
is not gonna be happy with me.

183
00:10:52,536 --> 00:10:55,800
I soaked up some mega rays.

184
00:10:55,844 --> 00:10:57,889
Gosh, you can see it.
You look glowing.

185
00:10:57,933 --> 00:10:58,934
You look really dark.

186
00:10:59,238 --> 00:11:01,327
Girls, I might just pack up
and moved there.

187
00:11:01,371 --> 00:11:03,068
- What? Where?
- Where did you go?

188
00:11:03,503 --> 00:11:06,071
It's this tiny little oasis
on the coast of Florida.

189
00:11:06,115 --> 00:11:07,943
It's people like us.
Mid-lifers

190
00:11:07,986 --> 00:11:11,076
who still like to strut past
the pool and stop the party

191
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,210
dead in its tracks with a tube
top and full jewelry.

192
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:16,386
- Oh. Yeah.
- I'm not kidding.

193
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:17,953
I feel like I got a soul-douche.

194
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,303
- A soul-douche? Well...

195
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,913
And not that I was looking,

196
00:11:21,957 --> 00:11:24,611
but there are so many
gorgeous men there.

197
00:11:24,655 --> 00:11:26,135
We're talking Tommy Bahama

198
00:11:26,178 --> 00:11:27,484
from head to toe.

199
00:11:27,527 --> 00:11:29,616
Tommy Bahama.

200
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:31,662
Put that with a 24-hour CVS

201
00:11:31,705 --> 00:11:33,533
and you got yourself a party.

202
00:11:33,577 --> 00:11:36,885
I mean best week of my life.
You girls have got to go.

203
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:38,974
- Well, not the best...
- Oh, yeah, no.

204
00:11:39,017 --> 00:11:40,366
- We're not...
- Time right now.

205
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,454
We're not in a place

206
00:11:41,977 --> 00:11:43,108
- to really go anywhere.
- We can't really leave.

207
00:11:43,152 --> 00:11:44,457
I'll drop off a brochure later.

208
00:11:44,501 --> 00:11:47,069
- Oh, wow. Thank you.
- Oh, yeah.

209
00:11:47,112 --> 00:11:48,635
- That won't be necessary.
- I mean, yeah.

210
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,333
It'd be nice to see
what it looks like.

211
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,638
What's the name
of the place again?

212
00:11:51,682 --> 00:11:53,336
Vista Del Mar!

213
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,123
- View of the swordfish.
- View of the mar.

214
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:03,607
Before we begin
I just wanna thank

215
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,697
Barb and Star for hosting
tonight's talking club

216
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,699
and for making their famous,

217
00:12:09,308 --> 00:12:12,485
usual hot dog soup. Again.

218
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:14,444
- You're welcome.
- It's a simple recipe.

219
00:12:14,487 --> 00:12:16,359
- Simple.
- Oh, Gail's not here,

220
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,797
but it's 6:00 on the dot.
So, it's time to lock the door.

221
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:24,367
- I'm here.

222
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,195
You're late Gail, buh-bye.

223
00:12:28,675 --> 00:12:31,940
Well, Talking Club
is officially in session.

224
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:35,073
I was really hoping to talk
this week about horses.

225
00:12:35,857 --> 00:12:37,206
Specifically my horse,

226
00:12:37,249 --> 00:12:39,121
and the spectacular time
we had...

227
00:12:39,164 --> 00:12:41,123
You know the rules, Delores.

228
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,342
We only share about the topic

229
00:12:43,386 --> 00:12:45,344
that we pick out
of the talking jar.

230
00:12:46,171 --> 00:12:47,477
Give me your soup.

231
00:12:57,966 --> 00:12:59,706
Today's topic is...

232
00:13:01,752 --> 00:13:02,709
jobs.

233
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:08,063
I wanted to talk about
my job at the Christmas store.

234
00:13:08,106 --> 00:13:11,153
I know everyone thinks
it's not busy right now,

235
00:13:11,196 --> 00:13:14,156
but we are... all year round.

236
00:13:15,592 --> 00:13:17,594
- I believe you.
- Thank you.

237
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,988
Well, I love my job
at the pharmacy.

238
00:13:20,858 --> 00:13:22,642
I get to play with the pills,

239
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:25,689
and sometimes I shake them
along to the music.

240
00:13:26,211 --> 00:13:28,518
Star, we can't tell the ladies
what happened today.

241
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:30,607
What? You mean lie? We can't.

242
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,001
Oh, we just lost our job
at the hottest place in town.

243
00:13:33,044 --> 00:13:34,654
- What will they think of us?
- Oh,

244
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:36,091
and I love my uniform.

245
00:13:36,134 --> 00:13:37,527
It's all white,

246
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,704
so I get to set myself apart
with character socks.

247
00:13:41,574 --> 00:13:43,185
- Those look fun.

248
00:13:43,228 --> 00:13:46,057
These have coffee cups
and coffee beans on them.

249
00:13:46,101 --> 00:13:48,668
- I wish you dress me.
- I don't have time.

250
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:50,975
Barb and Star?
What about you guys?

251
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:53,195
I mean, you guys work at the
hottest place in town!

252
00:13:53,238 --> 00:13:55,110
Maybe socks
would be a good topic.

253
00:13:55,153 --> 00:13:57,286
Oh, yes. I love the socks
without ankle.

254
00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:00,202
Barb, Star, the topic is jobs.

255
00:14:02,552 --> 00:14:04,206
Tell us about your jobs.

256
00:14:04,858 --> 00:14:06,469
- Oh. Well...
- Oh.

257
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:11,517
- Uh... Today was...
- Uh, it was busy.

258
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:12,475
- It was busy.
- Yeah.

259
00:14:12,866 --> 00:14:15,565
So, we had a lot of...
Big delivery.

260
00:14:15,608 --> 00:14:17,741
- One big delivery.
- With furniture.

261
00:14:17,784 --> 00:14:19,264
- And sofa.
- Tables.

262
00:14:19,308 --> 00:14:20,700
There was a guy.

263
00:14:20,744 --> 00:14:22,528
- He was delivering,
- He was tall.

264
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:25,488
- The other was shorter.
- Not as tall.

265
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,620
- We filled out paperwork.
- Inventory.

266
00:14:27,664 --> 00:14:28,752
Did everything.

267
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:31,276
- Then we had to load it all in.
- To look at the samples.

268
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,496
- ...brought the samples.
- ...clipboard.

269
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,889
- Made some tea.
- We signed up.

270
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:38,240
And then
we got a promotion.

271
00:14:38,283 --> 00:14:39,284
- Oh!
- What?

272
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,547
- Wow!
- Congrats.

273
00:14:41,808 --> 00:14:43,332
Congratulations you guys!

274
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,987
- Go home, Gail.
- We're so proud of you.

275
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,510
We should do a toast.

276
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,385
What? That's how
I cheers with my horse.

277
00:14:58,651 --> 00:15:00,610
Barb and I lost our jobs.

278
00:15:02,438 --> 00:15:04,657
Sorry. The store closed.

279
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:07,182
And the story we just told you
about the delivery,

280
00:15:07,225 --> 00:15:09,227
the men coming,
the trucks, the nightstands,

281
00:15:09,271 --> 00:15:10,663
the fabric samples, the couches,

282
00:15:10,707 --> 00:15:13,231
the tall guy and the shorter guy
that wasn't as tall?

283
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:15,059
- That was a lie!

284
00:15:15,103 --> 00:15:16,191
Oh, damn.

285
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:21,239
We all know there are only three
major rules in Talking Club.

286
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,329
Rule number one, no sneakers.

287
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:28,072
Rule number two, no swearing
except for the "F" word.

288
00:15:28,855 --> 00:15:32,381
Rule number three, no lying.

289
00:15:32,424 --> 00:15:34,470
You two are banned
from the club.

290
00:15:34,513 --> 00:15:35,558
- What?
- What?

291
00:15:36,037 --> 00:15:37,864
Ladies, grab your
purses, and pocket books.

292
00:15:37,908 --> 00:15:40,432
- No, Debbie, please.
- Isn't there like

293
00:15:40,476 --> 00:15:42,086
a three-strike rule
or something?

294
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,480
Please, we won't do it again.
This is all we have left.

295
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:46,177
- Can we have one more chance?
- One more chance.

296
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:47,744
- Please.
- It was just one lie.

297
00:15:47,787 --> 00:15:50,094
- Give us a chance.
- We don't know what to say.

298
00:15:57,014 --> 00:16:00,322
Barb, are you upset with me?
I'm sorry I blurted it out.

299
00:16:00,365 --> 00:16:03,412
Star, no.
I can never be upset with you.

300
00:16:03,934 --> 00:16:07,459
It's okay, we lied.
We deserved it.

301
00:16:10,158 --> 00:16:12,029
Do you know
they make denim culottes?

302
00:16:13,074 --> 00:16:14,553
They're for our weather.

303
00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:16,338
Do you think
Jennifer Convertibles closing

304
00:16:16,381 --> 00:16:17,382
was a sign?

305
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:19,819
And getting kicked out
of Talking Club?

306
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,865
A sign?

307
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:25,173
Okay. You know those days
when you see me

308
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:27,218
- just staring at the carpet?
- Yes.

309
00:16:27,262 --> 00:16:29,046
Sometimes I daydream.

310
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,527
About life
outside of this place.

311
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,748
Maybe something is telling us
to do something different.

312
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:38,447
- Oh, my gosh. Yes.
- Yes? Oh!

313
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,927
Should we try those socks
with individual toes?

314
00:16:40,971 --> 00:16:42,233
- Yeah.
- What do they feel like?

315
00:16:42,277 --> 00:16:43,191
I've always wondered.

316
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,150
I wonder how my toes will react.
They've always been together.

317
00:16:46,194 --> 00:16:47,412
I think they'll like it.

318
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:49,545
- What if it's something bigger?
- Like what?

319
00:16:50,328 --> 00:16:52,939
- Like this.

320
00:16:52,983 --> 00:16:54,289
- A trip?
- Yes.

321
00:16:54,332 --> 00:16:55,899
- Star...
- No, look,

322
00:16:55,942 --> 00:16:58,119
look at these two people.
Look how happy they are.

323
00:16:58,162 --> 00:17:00,382
Imagine that's you and me
riding on that banana boat.

324
00:17:00,425 --> 00:17:02,079
Just bouncing around

325
00:17:02,123 --> 00:17:04,212
with our arms and legs
spread wide open

326
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:07,040
with water and air
going all inside of us.

327
00:17:07,084 --> 00:17:08,564
This is dangerous.

328
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,131
Things happen to people
on trips.

329
00:17:10,174 --> 00:17:11,610
What if we get lost,
or poisoned,

330
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:13,656
or we get a rash?
What if they put us in jail

331
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,310
'cause they think
we put drugs in our butts?

332
00:17:15,353 --> 00:17:16,615
What if we fall out of a car?

333
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:18,748
Have you heard
of traveler's diarrhea, Star?

334
00:17:19,836 --> 00:17:23,883
Your stomach doesn't care where
you are, it just releases.

335
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:25,885
Haven't you ever wondered
if the real ocean

336
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:27,278
sounds like our noise machine?

337
00:17:27,322 --> 00:17:29,193
The real ocean
has strong currents.

338
00:17:29,237 --> 00:17:31,978
And people get swept out,
and they sink and they drown.

339
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:35,199
Okay.

340
00:17:36,592 --> 00:17:38,811
I know things changed for you
after Ron died.

341
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:40,813
They certainly did for me
after Carmine Left.

342
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:42,989
But we used to have fun.

343
00:17:43,686 --> 00:17:45,775
Remember that one time
we went on a haunted hay ride?

344
00:17:45,818 --> 00:17:47,777
- And we got chased by that man

345
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,605
with a Jack-o'- lantern head
and a chainsaw.

346
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:50,954
And then we heard later

347
00:17:51,302 --> 00:17:53,478
he wasn't an actor, he just
escaped from the local prison.

348
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:55,045
- He was a real killer.
- Killer.

349
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:56,916
- He was trying to kill us.
- Oh.

350
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,441
Remember the 4th of July when
we roller skated through town

351
00:17:59,484 --> 00:18:01,007
in our sequined leotards?

352
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:02,922
And my sparkler
caught your hair on fire?

353
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:04,837
And then my hair
caught your hair on fire.

354
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:07,797
We caught
each other's hair on fire.

355
00:18:08,363 --> 00:18:09,494
Oh.

356
00:18:12,018 --> 00:18:17,807
Barb, I feel like...
we lost our... shimmer.

357
00:18:19,243 --> 00:18:21,550
Isn't that just what happens
when you get older?

358
00:18:21,593 --> 00:18:23,682
No. I mean, it doesn't have to.

359
00:18:23,726 --> 00:18:26,076
We still have a chance
to be those people again.

360
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:28,557
I mean,
look all of our stories.

361
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,211
They're... they're from the past.

362
00:18:30,254 --> 00:18:32,474
We don't
have any stories from now.

363
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:37,479
I feel like we're fading away.

364
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:40,221
I don't wanna fade away.

365
00:18:40,264 --> 00:18:42,484
Hey, look, I know you're afraid
something is gonna go wrong,

366
00:18:42,527 --> 00:18:44,834
but what if it doesn't?

367
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:47,097
What if we go there
and have a time of our lives?

368
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,142
We lay on the beach
and we feel the sun

369
00:18:49,186 --> 00:18:50,840
and we have breakfast
and have muffins

370
00:18:50,883 --> 00:18:52,581
and croissants
with all kinds of jelly...

371
00:18:52,624 --> 00:18:54,191
- Let's do it.
- What?

372
00:18:55,061 --> 00:18:57,803
I can't believe I'm saying this.
Let's throw caution to the wind

373
00:18:57,847 --> 00:18:59,414
like a couple
of rock and rollers!

374
00:18:59,457 --> 00:19:00,763
- Really?
- Yes.

375
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,765
- Barb.
- Star.

376
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:06,290
Let's go to Vista Del Mar.

377
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,164
I'm gonna bring those
culottes I bought at Kaboom.

378
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,862
- Culottes?
- My fringe shorts.

379
00:19:12,905 --> 00:19:14,342
- Tangerine pants.
- Oh, my curlers.

380
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:16,518
I don't want anything
to happen to my curlers.

381
00:19:17,997 --> 00:19:19,390
- Anyway...
- Cheese pizza.

382
00:19:19,434 --> 00:19:21,610
Gosh, let me
just get mushroom. Well.

383
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:23,829
Traveler's checks.
Leftover from my wedding.

384
00:19:23,873 --> 00:19:25,744
For the shower.
Safety first.

385
00:19:25,788 --> 00:19:28,312
Always good to bring
a little piece of art

386
00:19:28,356 --> 00:19:30,183
- from home.
- We're gonna buy a lot

387
00:19:30,227 --> 00:19:31,446
- of Florida cookies.
- Some rope.

388
00:19:31,489 --> 00:19:32,882
This is gonna be
for the cheese pizza.

389
00:19:32,925 --> 00:19:34,231
My curlers.

390
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:37,321
This is a toilet
scrubber and a back scrubber.

391
00:19:37,365 --> 00:19:39,932
Maybe it's time
to put the curlers in.

392
00:19:39,976 --> 00:19:42,152
- Vista Del Mar...
- Here we come.

393
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:51,379
What's on your mind?

394
00:19:51,683 --> 00:19:53,250
I'm just nervous
something is going to go wrong.

395
00:19:53,294 --> 00:19:55,296
I even tried
to distract myself today

396
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:57,733
by training some of the mice
from the lab.

397
00:19:57,776 --> 00:20:00,562
Everything is going to be
fine. I promise.

398
00:20:00,605 --> 00:20:02,215
I want you to get there early.

399
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:03,565
Get the lay of the land.

400
00:20:03,826 --> 00:20:05,218
Here's the microchip.

401
00:20:05,262 --> 00:20:08,004
The receiver cannot
be activated without it.

402
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:10,398
Be very careful with it.
It's fragile.

403
00:20:11,573 --> 00:20:12,965
There's a compartment for it
in your belt.

404
00:20:13,444 --> 00:20:14,924
Yoyo designed it.

405
00:20:15,228 --> 00:20:16,969
God, I love that little boy...

406
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:19,232
And most importantly...

407
00:20:20,103 --> 00:20:21,322
the antidote.

408
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:22,497
You might get stung.

409
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,803
This will make you
immune to the poison.

410
00:20:24,847 --> 00:20:28,459
- I won't let you down, my love.
- No, you won't.

411
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,683
I've been working on this plan
my entire life.

412
00:20:35,988 --> 00:20:39,775
And now, it's finally time.

413
00:20:39,818 --> 00:20:41,907
I can't wait for all
of this to be over.

414
00:20:41,951 --> 00:20:43,953
After what those people
did to you,

415
00:20:43,996 --> 00:20:45,128
and for you to be happy,

416
00:20:46,172 --> 00:20:48,044
and for us to be
an official couple.

417
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,224
Um...

418
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,621
Mm-hmm. Yes.

419
00:21:00,665 --> 00:21:02,450
You do wanna be together, right?

420
00:21:03,494 --> 00:21:05,801
- Be an official couple?
- Mm-hmm.

421
00:21:08,107 --> 00:21:09,195
Yes, of course I do.

422
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:10,675
I'm just, um,

423
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:13,591
it's hard for me relax.
You know, until this is over.

424
00:21:13,635 --> 00:21:16,072
- You understand.
- Yeah.

425
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:17,334
So...

426
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:20,772
don't screw it up.

427
00:21:24,907 --> 00:21:26,474
Strings, you're still off.

428
00:21:28,563 --> 00:21:29,651
The rest can have cheese.

429
00:21:35,526 --> 00:21:39,269
Woo! Well, I was not
prepared for that take off.

430
00:21:39,312 --> 00:21:40,357
Me neither.

431
00:21:40,836 --> 00:21:42,664
Ma'am, I apologize for screaming
at the top of my lungs.

432
00:21:42,707 --> 00:21:43,708
Mm.

433
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:47,495
- What? A free magazine!
- What?

434
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:49,758
I have got to read
this interview with Don Cheadle.

435
00:21:50,106 --> 00:21:52,543
Oh, I love him.
You know that reminds me,

436
00:21:52,587 --> 00:21:54,458
the other day
I said to myself...

437
00:21:54,502 --> 00:21:56,721
I cannot think of a famous
actress named Trish.

438
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,202
You're kidding.
That's my favorite name.

439
00:21:59,245 --> 00:22:02,292
What? Mine too! How did we
never talk about this?

440
00:22:02,335 --> 00:22:06,731
To me, a woman named Trish
is a woman you can count on.

441
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:09,647
Really has her act together.
Athletic, natural.

442
00:22:09,691 --> 00:22:12,084
Just real natural.
And loves the holidays.

443
00:22:12,128 --> 00:22:14,609
Trish? At Christmas? Forget it.

444
00:22:14,652 --> 00:22:16,175
She gets everybody a gift.

445
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:17,873
- What about Halloween?
- Oh.

446
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:20,353
Trish leaves a big pot
of candy for the kids.

447
00:22:20,397 --> 00:22:22,312
- Yeah.
- Because she trusts.

448
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:23,661
- She'd be out

449
00:22:23,705 --> 00:22:25,141
- with her girlfriends.
- Country-dancing.

450
00:22:25,184 --> 00:22:26,795
She has a natural
sense of rhythm.

451
00:22:26,838 --> 00:22:28,449
She'd have one ear
double-pierced.

452
00:22:28,492 --> 00:22:30,015
- And the other...
- Just single.

453
00:22:31,103 --> 00:22:32,801
Once when I was applying
for a job at Talbots,

454
00:22:32,844 --> 00:22:35,064
- I told them my name was Trish.
- What?

455
00:22:35,107 --> 00:22:37,414
Well, remember when
I was in that hit and run

456
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:38,763
- and that lady passed?
- Uh-huh.

457
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:40,199
- Her name was Trish. Yeah.
- Really?

458
00:22:40,243 --> 00:22:42,201
Trish loses one of her
ears in a twister,

459
00:22:42,245 --> 00:22:44,377
- but not her hearing.
- She's a storm chaser.

460
00:22:44,421 --> 00:22:46,031
Her mom doesn't want her to be.

461
00:22:46,075 --> 00:22:47,816
- Their relationship is tough.
- Hmm.

462
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:50,122
Trish always wanted to be
a portrait photographer.

463
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,516
She loves people.
She would always say,

464
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,779
"A person's face says
a lot about how they look."

465
00:22:54,823 --> 00:22:56,259
- Oh, that's beautiful.
- Yeah.

466
00:22:56,302 --> 00:22:57,478
Okay.

467
00:22:57,521 --> 00:22:59,001
- Trish's favorite number?
- Four.

468
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,742
- Her favorite animal?
- Hen!

469
00:23:00,785 --> 00:23:02,526
- Trish's favorite movie?
- Oh.

470
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:03,875
- Short Circuit.
- The Ring.

471
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,576
And then she said,
"You know what, skin cancer?

472
00:23:09,402 --> 00:23:10,839
"You are not gonna take me.

473
00:23:12,144 --> 00:23:13,972
"Because I'm gonna take
my own life."

474
00:23:14,886 --> 00:23:15,844
And she did.

475
00:23:17,236 --> 00:23:20,326
She jumped off that cliff
near her house on the Cape.

476
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,806
Dove right into the water,

477
00:23:22,546 --> 00:23:25,549
hitting every rock on the way.

478
00:23:25,593 --> 00:23:29,161
And now there's a beautiful
spirit out there in the ocean.

479
00:23:30,249 --> 00:23:31,947
And you know what her name is?

480
00:23:35,951 --> 00:23:37,387
It's Trish.

481
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:40,564
Trish.

482
00:23:41,652 --> 00:23:43,959
# Florida #

483
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:47,745
# Florida

484
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,662
# Going back to the peninsula

485
00:23:53,185 --> 00:23:55,840
# Ooh, Florida

486
00:24:03,456 --> 00:24:04,849
I'm here.

487
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,551
Oh, the air
feels different here.

488
00:24:10,594 --> 00:24:12,465
Oh, my God, you're right.

489
00:24:13,205 --> 00:24:14,555
Smells like Red Lobster.

490
00:24:15,817 --> 00:24:18,254
Look, it's the shuttle
for our hotel!

491
00:24:18,907 --> 00:24:20,386
Oh, my God.

492
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,606
# Florida #

493
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,175
# Florida

494
00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:30,571
# Going back to the peninsula

495
00:24:31,746 --> 00:24:34,052
# Ooh, Florida

496
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:38,230
# Ooh, Florida

497
00:24:39,928 --> 00:24:41,799
# Florida

498
00:24:45,281 --> 00:24:50,025
- Oh, my Star.
- Oh, my Barb.

499
00:24:50,373 --> 00:24:51,374
Let me take your bags, ma'am.

500
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:53,158
- Check in's over there.

501
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:54,638
Hope you had a nice flight.

502
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,254
# Welcome to Palm Vista

503
00:25:02,298 --> 00:25:04,343
# A Floridian paradise

504
00:25:04,387 --> 00:25:06,650
# All your dreams
Come true here #

505
00:25:06,694 --> 00:25:08,826
# Every drink
Is served with ice #

506
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,091
# We're here
To please every member #

507
00:25:13,135 --> 00:25:15,050
# We love the pie in town

508
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:17,618
# It's a middle-age Nirvana

509
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:19,663
# At the Palm Vista Hotel

510
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,796
# Add this macaroni salad #

511
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:24,059
# At the all
You can eat buffet #

512
00:25:24,102 --> 00:25:25,974
# We'll chop your food
With passion #

513
00:25:26,017 --> 00:25:28,193
# We'll change your sheets here Every day #

514
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:29,673
# Well, almost every day

515
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:33,938
# Everywhere I look I see official couples #

516
00:25:34,983 --> 00:25:38,377
# And soon
My turn will come around #

517
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:43,469
# A man must do what it takes
To win his sweetheart #

518
00:25:43,513 --> 00:25:47,343
# So I'm gonna kill everyone
In this town #

519
00:25:47,996 --> 00:25:49,693
# The spa is so relaxing #

520
00:25:49,737 --> 00:25:51,652
# The ocean is aquamarine

521
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,915
# I'm recovering
From my divorce here #

522
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:57,614
# And the pool has chlorine #

523
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:03,576
# So get ready For the time of your life #

524
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:09,060
# We're gonna rock
Your freaking bell #

525
00:26:09,104 --> 00:26:12,368
# Are you ready
For your soul-douche #

526
00:26:12,411 --> 00:26:15,545
- # Soul-douche
- # Soul-douche

527
00:26:15,588 --> 00:26:18,374
# Soul-douche

528
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,768
# At the Palm Vista #

529
00:26:20,811 --> 00:26:23,814
# The Palm Vista
The Palm... #

530
00:26:23,858 --> 00:26:25,468
# Vista...

531
00:26:25,511 --> 00:26:27,949
# Motel #

532
00:26:27,992 --> 00:26:30,429
Stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

533
00:26:32,518 --> 00:26:35,347
Did you say Palm Vista Motel?

534
00:26:35,391 --> 00:26:36,566
Uh, yeah.

535
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:37,828
# The beds are tempurpedic

536
00:26:37,872 --> 00:26:39,438
No, Jerry! No.
You're late again.

537
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:40,613
And the song is over.

538
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,704
Ma'ams, I am so sorry,

539
00:26:43,747 --> 00:26:47,751
but this is the Palm Vista Hotel
Spa and Salon.

540
00:26:47,795 --> 00:26:50,841
You are clearly staying
at the Palm Vista Motel

541
00:26:50,885 --> 00:26:52,495
which is right outside the doors

542
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:55,367
two football fields away
across the hot parking lot.

543
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:56,499
So, have a good day.

544
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:57,892
Can we stay here?

545
00:26:57,935 --> 00:26:59,589
You have any rooms?
We really like it here.

546
00:26:59,632 --> 00:27:01,591
Ladies, you can flirt with me
all you want,

547
00:27:01,634 --> 00:27:03,201
but it's not
gonna change my mind.

548
00:27:03,245 --> 00:27:05,334
There is absolutely
no vacancies.

549
00:27:05,682 --> 00:27:07,292
We are completely booked up

550
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:09,860
because of this weekend's
Seafood Jam.

551
00:27:09,904 --> 00:27:10,948
Have a great day.

552
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,299
Oh, brother.

553
00:27:26,834 --> 00:27:28,923
We'll, this looks nice too.

554
00:27:29,532 --> 00:27:32,187
Oh, look at that. Painting.

555
00:27:33,449 --> 00:27:35,973
Oh, hi. Hi.

556
00:27:36,017 --> 00:27:37,366
- Hi.
- Hi.

557
00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:39,847
We have a reservation
under Barb and Star.

558
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,240
Okay, six nights?

559
00:27:42,284 --> 00:27:43,676
- Yup.
- Yup. Mm-hmm.

560
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,330
Yeah. Do you want towels?

561
00:27:45,853 --> 00:27:48,029
- Yes, uh, yeah, uh-huh.
- Yeah I think so.

562
00:27:48,638 --> 00:27:49,900
Do you need sheets?

563
00:27:51,684 --> 00:27:54,513
- Probably.
- Yeah, for the bed.

564
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,212
No pillows though, okay?

565
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:04,828
- Okay.
- Okay.

566
00:28:06,569 --> 00:28:08,658
- Gosh.

567
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,226
This is peaceful.

568
00:28:12,662 --> 00:28:14,795
I like how the stains
everywhere look like designs.

569
00:28:15,056 --> 00:28:16,405
Oh, yeah.

570
00:28:16,448 --> 00:28:17,841
I am warm though.

571
00:28:17,885 --> 00:28:18,886
- Me too.
- Yeah.

572
00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:20,278
- I'm really warm.
- Yeah.

573
00:28:21,105 --> 00:28:23,325
I have an idea.
What if we go check out the pool

574
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,153
- over at the nice hotel?
- Star.

575
00:28:25,196 --> 00:28:27,416
- Is that even legal?
- I honestly don't know.

576
00:28:29,157 --> 00:28:31,115
- Come.

577
00:28:32,595 --> 00:28:34,031
- Oh. Woo.
- Whoa, gosh.

578
00:28:34,075 --> 00:28:35,728
- Better get some water.
- My eyes...

579
00:28:35,772 --> 00:28:37,078
I don't see anything.

580
00:28:37,121 --> 00:28:39,558
# The sun will come out
Tomorrow #

581
00:28:39,602 --> 00:28:42,692
# Bet your bottom dollar
That tomorrow #

582
00:28:42,735 --> 00:28:44,737
# There'll be sun

583
00:28:45,564 --> 00:28:48,219
# Just thinkin' about
tomorrow #

584
00:28:48,263 --> 00:28:51,048
# Clears away the cobwebs
And the sorrow #

585
00:28:51,092 --> 00:28:53,181
# 'Til there's none

586
00:28:53,224 --> 00:28:56,184
# With the day that's gray

587
00:28:56,227 --> 00:28:59,317
# And lonely
I just stick out my chin #

588
00:28:59,883 --> 00:29:03,626
# And grin, and say #

589
00:29:08,457 --> 00:29:11,112
Mickey was right.
Everyone here is so friendly!

590
00:29:11,155 --> 00:29:13,201
I know.
Star?

591
00:29:13,244 --> 00:29:14,637
- What?
- That guy is waving at you.

592
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,987
I think he likes you.
You should take a lover

593
00:29:17,031 --> 00:29:18,206
- on this trip.
- Barb,

594
00:29:18,684 --> 00:29:20,948
men are not attracted to me,
okay? The guy's just being nice.

595
00:29:20,991 --> 00:29:23,428
And Carmine was proof of that
when he left me for Dina!

596
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:24,734
That is not true.

597
00:29:24,777 --> 00:29:26,997
Men find me disgusting,
and I'm okay with it.

598
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:29,043
Star, if I said it once,
I said it a million times,

599
00:29:29,086 --> 00:29:30,435
you could model
for effin' Chico's,

600
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:32,350
- and I'm not just saying that.
- Chico's?

601
00:29:32,394 --> 00:29:35,179
- Come on. I wish.
- Or Costco.

602
00:29:35,223 --> 00:29:36,833
I'm talking
the Kirkland brand.

603
00:29:37,225 --> 00:29:39,488
Kirkland? Oh, my God.

604
00:29:39,531 --> 00:29:41,185
- Oh, my God.

605
00:29:42,012 --> 00:29:44,014
I think I'm gonna try
the frog's legs.

606
00:29:44,058 --> 00:29:45,407
What? Oh, gosh, I couldn't.

607
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,974
Every time I think of frog legs

608
00:29:47,017 --> 00:29:48,453
I think of Kermit
riding his bicycle

609
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:50,368
and how much he used his legs.
He really needed them.

610
00:29:50,803 --> 00:29:52,893
He did. Oh, I feel bad now.

611
00:29:52,936 --> 00:29:55,199
Okay. I'm gonna do
the veal-stuffed manatee.

612
00:29:55,808 --> 00:29:58,594
Ooh. I'm gonna try

613
00:29:58,637 --> 00:30:00,248
the fried bald eagle babies.

614
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:02,554
- Oh, yum.
- Excuse me, ladies?

615
00:30:02,598 --> 00:30:03,642
Hi.

616
00:30:04,252 --> 00:30:06,036
Can I see you
out of the pool, please?

617
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:08,517
We're so sorry.

618
00:30:08,952 --> 00:30:10,127
- Please. You're right.
- I knew this was gonna happen.

619
00:30:10,562 --> 00:30:13,043
- She said we'd go to jail.
- The other motel, it was so hot.

620
00:30:13,087 --> 00:30:14,479
- Stop!

621
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:15,698
Ladies listen.

622
00:30:16,177 --> 00:30:19,180
There's been a cancellation
and we have a room available.

623
00:30:19,223 --> 00:30:20,181
- What? Here?
- What?

624
00:30:20,442 --> 00:30:22,096
It's not really a cancellation.

625
00:30:23,227 --> 00:30:24,925
The family that was in the room
is missing.

626
00:30:24,968 --> 00:30:25,926
Oh!

627
00:30:25,969 --> 00:30:27,449
It's probably the husband.

628
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,886
It's always the husband.
He reported them missing,

629
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,280
the next thing you know,
they're stuffed up in a chimney.

630
00:30:32,671 --> 00:30:34,891
Anyway, the room is yours,
if you'd like it.

631
00:30:39,287 --> 00:30:41,376
Yes. Yes, yes.

632
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:43,030
Ooh, your voices
are really high.

633
00:30:57,914 --> 00:30:59,002
Oh, my God.

634
00:30:59,046 --> 00:31:00,786
- Look at this room!
- Woo.

635
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:03,311
Star, did you see
that restaurant?

636
00:31:03,354 --> 00:31:04,616
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm so excited

637
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,922
it's almost time for dinner!

638
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:07,358
And time for a cocktail?

639
00:31:07,619 --> 00:31:09,273
- Star!
- Okay. You go in the bathroom,

640
00:31:09,317 --> 00:31:10,753
I'll lay out our bottoms
and tops!

641
00:31:10,796 --> 00:31:11,972
You know what
should wear tonight?

642
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,017
Our evening culottes!

643
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:19,066
Everything's going
according to plan, my love.

644
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:20,763
I'm also missing you.

645
00:31:20,806 --> 00:31:23,679
There are lots of people here,
lots of official couples.

646
00:31:24,462 --> 00:31:25,333
Do you miss me?

647
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:31,208
Oh, well, you're usually here.
And now you're not.

648
00:31:31,252 --> 00:31:32,949
And I know you're gone.

649
00:31:32,993 --> 00:31:36,431
And when you return,
you'll be back.

650
00:31:36,474 --> 00:31:37,693
Is that what you mean?

651
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,217
- Never-mind.
- Oh, Edgar,

652
00:31:40,261 --> 00:31:42,002
I feel like I'm sensing
some 'tude.

653
00:31:42,045 --> 00:31:44,047
- No, no.
- I really must run.

654
00:31:44,091 --> 00:31:45,527
Yoyo and I have been playing
hide and seek

655
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,572
and I haven't seen him
since last night.

656
00:31:55,841 --> 00:31:57,191
Good evening,
ladies and gentleman,

657
00:31:57,234 --> 00:31:58,627
I'm Richard Cheese.

658
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:01,499
# What I really, really love

659
00:32:01,543 --> 00:32:04,241
# When I look
Around this place #

660
00:32:04,981 --> 00:32:08,028
# Is all the sets of boobies #

661
00:32:08,071 --> 00:32:10,682
# And I want them in my face

662
00:32:11,727 --> 00:32:13,120
# Hello, boobies

663
00:32:14,121 --> 00:32:15,557
# I love boobies

664
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,254
# I love gazongas

665
00:32:17,298 --> 00:32:20,605
# I love knockers
And chimichangas #

666
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:22,912
# I love melons and bonbons

667
00:32:22,955 --> 00:32:24,522
# And Winnebagos

668
00:32:24,566 --> 00:32:27,743
# I'll take a big chest
Up shirt potatoes #

669
00:32:27,786 --> 00:32:30,180
# Because I love boobs

670
00:32:30,224 --> 00:32:31,268
Thank you.

671
00:32:31,312 --> 00:32:32,878
Oh, my, these are comfortable.

672
00:32:32,922 --> 00:32:34,576
Put another whiskey, please?

673
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:38,493
- Room number again, please, sir?
- Six-eleven.

674
00:32:38,536 --> 00:32:42,453
Oh, 611? Oh, my... Barb.

675
00:32:42,497 --> 00:32:44,542
Oh, my gosh! He's 611.

676
00:32:44,586 --> 00:32:46,979
Six-eleven? We're in 124!

677
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:51,288
- We're in room 124.
- And you're...

678
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:53,595
Wow.

679
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:57,816
I'm Barb and this is Star,
and you are...

680
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,906
Edgar.

681
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,517
- Oh. Edgar.
- Nice.

682
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,784
I'm sorry, I'm having a bad day.

683
00:33:08,827 --> 00:33:10,699
Oh, no.
Are you not going?

684
00:33:11,569 --> 00:33:13,005
That's what's happening with us.

685
00:33:13,049 --> 00:33:14,703
Traveling really stops you up.

686
00:33:14,746 --> 00:33:16,270
I mean, my stomach it's like

687
00:33:16,792 --> 00:33:19,099
just a bunch
of rolled up sacks in there.

688
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:21,884
All in line trying to get out,
it's like a traffic jam.

689
00:33:21,927 --> 00:33:24,104
No, uh, work stuff.

690
00:33:24,974 --> 00:33:27,194
Oh, my gosh.
We have work stuff too!

691
00:33:27,237 --> 00:33:29,109
- We just lost our dream jobs.
- Yeah.

692
00:33:29,152 --> 00:33:30,588
It's been really hard.

693
00:33:31,154 --> 00:33:34,549
Star, why don't you cheer him up
with one of your greeting card

694
00:33:34,592 --> 00:33:36,159
- poems?
- Oh, Barb. Don't listen to her.

695
00:33:36,203 --> 00:33:38,030
- No. I'm so rusty, no.
- Come on.

696
00:33:38,074 --> 00:33:39,162
- Stop it.
- Come on.

697
00:33:39,206 --> 00:33:41,338
- Barb?
- Sorry, what is this?

698
00:33:41,382 --> 00:33:43,079
Star has a gift,
you should share it.

699
00:33:43,123 --> 00:33:44,907
Oh, it's nothing,
it's just a silly hobby I have.

700
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,822
I like to make my own
greeting cards, specifically

701
00:33:46,865 --> 00:33:49,868
for the middle aged, you know,
because we go through stuff.

702
00:33:49,912 --> 00:33:51,957
- Don't be shy, come on.
- Barb, please.

703
00:33:52,001 --> 00:33:53,611
Do it, just do it.
Help this man.

704
00:33:53,655 --> 00:33:57,963
Okay. Okay.
Just do one. Gosh.

705
00:33:58,007 --> 00:33:59,443
- You're gonna love this.
- Okay,

706
00:33:59,487 --> 00:34:01,445
- I'm gonna make it up.
- She's gonna make it up.

707
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:03,186
- Okay.
- Nothing planned.

708
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,710
She's thinking.
She's preparing.

709
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:07,016
We can't force it.

710
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:11,629
Sometimes life's umbrella
has holes in it,

711
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:17,287
and the water just pours
all over your shoulders

712
00:34:17,331 --> 00:34:20,160
- and your hair.
- All right.

713
00:34:20,812 --> 00:34:23,424
But don't worry,
because the rain will end.

714
00:34:24,555 --> 00:34:27,471
But you should also get
a replacement umbrella

715
00:34:27,515 --> 00:34:28,820
for the next time.

716
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,651
Gosh. Was that okay?
I was so nervous!

717
00:34:33,695 --> 00:34:35,958
I don't know how she does it.
Words just...

718
00:34:36,001 --> 00:34:38,395
fall out of her,
like, air comes out of a...

719
00:34:39,657 --> 00:34:41,093
- See, I can't do it.
- Anyway,

720
00:34:41,137 --> 00:34:42,747
I hope it helped a little.

721
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:45,359
Yeah, it did actually, yeah.
Thank you.

722
00:34:45,402 --> 00:34:46,403
See?

723
00:34:47,317 --> 00:34:49,189
- See?
- All right.

724
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:52,975
Thank you so much.
I'm gonna take a short break.

725
00:34:53,018 --> 00:34:54,498
I'll be right back, thank you.

726
00:34:55,151 --> 00:34:56,979
Okay. I'm back.
Thank you.

727
00:34:59,373 --> 00:35:01,375
- My turn to pick the drink.
- Okay.

728
00:35:01,418 --> 00:35:03,681
Okay. Ooh, George,
what's this drink

729
00:35:03,725 --> 00:35:05,292
with the skull
and crossbones over it?

730
00:35:05,335 --> 00:35:07,119
Can we get one of those?

731
00:35:12,037 --> 00:35:13,474
It's called The Buried Treasure.

732
00:35:13,517 --> 00:35:15,650
- Yo-ho-ho.
- No one's ever finished

733
00:35:15,693 --> 00:35:16,651
the whole thing.

734
00:35:17,608 --> 00:35:19,175
But if you get to the bottom,

735
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:20,437
there's a real treasure.

736
00:35:22,874 --> 00:35:24,876
You sure you guys wanna do this?

737
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,226
- Yeah.
- Yes.

738
00:35:26,269 --> 00:35:27,618
- Okay.
- I love treasures.

739
00:35:27,662 --> 00:35:29,272
- Yes.
- Yeah.

740
00:35:31,274 --> 00:35:34,234
# Tried to amend
My carnivorous habit #

741
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:37,715
# Made it nearly 70 days #

742
00:35:38,499 --> 00:35:39,848
You finished that already?

743
00:35:39,891 --> 00:35:40,936
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Yeah.

744
00:35:41,328 --> 00:35:42,938
Just for the record,
we never found the treasure.

745
00:35:42,981 --> 00:35:44,374
You found the chest
at the bottom

746
00:35:44,896 --> 00:35:46,202
- with the syrupy liquid?
- Yeah.

747
00:35:46,246 --> 00:35:47,638
- We licked it up.
- All the syrup.

748
00:35:47,682 --> 00:35:48,726
- Let's go.
- You open up

749
00:35:49,118 --> 00:35:50,337
the scuba diver's mask
and found the three pills?

750
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,599
- Uh-hmm.
- I took a pill.

751
00:35:51,642 --> 00:35:52,948
- I had one.
- I had a pill.

752
00:35:52,991 --> 00:35:57,735
Oh, well, that's you...
treasure.

753
00:35:57,779 --> 00:36:02,262
# Cheeseburger in paradise #

754
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:07,832
# Heaven on Earth
With an onion slice #

755
00:36:08,964 --> 00:36:13,534
# Not too particular
Not too precise #

756
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,667
# Cheeseburger... #

757
00:36:23,979 --> 00:36:27,069
# Near, far #

758
00:36:27,112 --> 00:36:30,246
# Wherever you are #

759
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:32,553
# I believe that #

760
00:36:32,596 --> 00:36:36,731
# The heart does go on #

761
00:36:39,734 --> 00:36:42,650
I like looking at wicker,
but I don't like sitting at it.

762
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,261
Hmm.

763
00:36:47,394 --> 00:36:50,353
# Love can touch us one time #

764
00:36:50,397 --> 00:36:52,877
# And last for a... #

765
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:55,576
Hello, it's me.
Of course, you didn't answer.

766
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,839
I'm getting sick of these...

767
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:02,800
mixed messages,
so I've met two young...

768
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:06,630
two middle-aged lady friends.

769
00:37:06,674 --> 00:37:09,764
If you don't start giving me
this respect thing soon...

770
00:37:09,807 --> 00:37:13,245
And the mission is off.

771
00:37:18,468 --> 00:37:22,342
# My heart will go on... #

772
00:37:52,763 --> 00:37:54,199
- Did we all...
- Yes.

773
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:56,288
A lot of times.

774
00:37:56,332 --> 00:37:58,726
I just got
your message, my darling.

775
00:37:58,769 --> 00:38:01,424
Let's not talk such nonsense
about completing the mission.

776
00:38:01,468 --> 00:38:03,513
You know it's hard for me
to show it,

777
00:38:03,557 --> 00:38:05,994
but I love you deeply.

778
00:38:06,037 --> 00:38:08,300
I know I rode you guys
like a couple of horses.

779
00:38:08,344 --> 00:38:10,651
- Oh. That's why...
- There up and down the hallway.

780
00:38:10,694 --> 00:38:12,130
- ...my back's a little sore.
- Yeah.

781
00:38:12,174 --> 00:38:13,436
- That's why my back...
- It might be sore

782
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,264
from all you did
against the table.

783
00:38:15,307 --> 00:38:17,309
- It was two against one there.
- Well, that's true.

784
00:38:17,353 --> 00:38:19,399
Miss you.
Kiss with tongues.

785
00:38:19,442 --> 00:38:21,531
We really used the room
today and our bodies.

786
00:38:21,575 --> 00:38:25,056
Bye, guys. Thanks very much
for the, um, great time.

787
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,884
- Oh, Edgar. Goodbye.
- Hey, come on.

788
00:38:26,928 --> 00:38:28,364
- Come on.
- Goodbye to you.

789
00:38:28,408 --> 00:38:29,583
- Have a great day.
- Bye.

790
00:38:30,105 --> 00:38:31,585
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

791
00:38:31,628 --> 00:38:33,891
- Oh, great.

792
00:38:33,935 --> 00:38:35,545
- Oh.
- Well, okay.

793
00:38:36,111 --> 00:38:39,680
Oh, gosh I have to admit
I do feel kind of funny.

794
00:38:39,723 --> 00:38:41,159
Was it because
I spanked your bottom?

795
00:38:41,203 --> 00:38:42,900
I think it's because
he's the first man

796
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,772
I've been with,
you know, since Carmine left.

797
00:38:44,815 --> 00:38:47,339
- Oh, I know how you feel.
- Yeah.

798
00:38:47,383 --> 00:38:49,298
I haven't been with anyone
since Ron.

799
00:38:49,341 --> 00:38:50,647
- You know that.
- Yeah.

800
00:38:51,735 --> 00:38:53,389
- Oh.
- Edgar was nice though.

801
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:54,608
- I mean...
- Oh, my gosh.

802
00:38:54,651 --> 00:38:56,740
What a nice man.

803
00:38:56,784 --> 00:38:59,351
- Was such a nice man.

804
00:39:06,924 --> 00:39:09,449
- My God! The shop...
- The shopping here.

805
00:39:09,492 --> 00:39:12,147
I love that magnet I got
that says "Flip Flop Zone"

806
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,801
in wacky letters?
I wanna look at it.

807
00:39:13,844 --> 00:39:15,716
That ones in the bag that says
Pookie McNally's Trinket Hut.

808
00:39:15,759 --> 00:39:17,282
- It's the yellow one.
- Oh, yes.

809
00:39:17,326 --> 00:39:18,806
That's where I got
my new phone case.

810
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:21,025
- I love it.
- It's like I'm listening

811
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:22,418
- to the ocean.
- I love it.

812
00:39:22,723 --> 00:39:24,899
- We don't have cell phones.
- Oh, no, I'm gonna take it home

813
00:39:24,942 --> 00:39:26,770
- and glue it to our land line.
- That's clever.

814
00:39:26,814 --> 00:39:29,294
- I can't believe we found this.
- That's going on our car.

815
00:39:29,338 --> 00:39:31,427
Do you know what
my favorite thing is?

816
00:39:31,471 --> 00:39:33,081
- Friendship bracelets?
- Yes.

817
00:39:33,124 --> 00:39:34,865
I can't believe
these were only three dollars.

818
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:36,780
It's a keepsake,
it's a keepsake for life.

819
00:39:38,565 --> 00:39:39,696
- It's a little sharp though.
- They are sharp.

820
00:39:40,088 --> 00:39:41,698
- They're a little sharp.
- Getting my skin a little bit.

821
00:39:41,742 --> 00:39:43,308
We'll break it in.
It'll wear down over time.

822
00:39:43,352 --> 00:39:44,832
- Yeah.
- Star.

823
00:39:45,441 --> 00:39:47,399
A glass bottom boat?

824
00:39:47,443 --> 00:39:49,184
- Let's see what time it leaves.
- Let's go fast.

825
00:39:49,532 --> 00:39:51,229
- We gotta hurry. Oh, God!
- Okay.

826
00:39:51,273 --> 00:39:52,796
- Sea shells!
- What? Gosh.

827
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,711
It's a freakin' clam
with googly eyes.

828
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:07,942
Ready to party?

829
00:40:07,985 --> 00:40:12,555
# Near, far, wherever you are #

830
00:40:24,436 --> 00:40:25,655
You imbecile!

831
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:26,961
I can fix this, I can.

832
00:40:27,004 --> 00:40:29,006
- Fiddlesticks.
- Please, just let me try.

833
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:30,660
I won't mess up again.
Please don't worry.

834
00:40:30,704 --> 00:40:31,879
Oh, I won't.

835
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,838
I know if I need
to count on someone,

836
00:40:34,882 --> 00:40:37,493
there's another man
I could call.

837
00:40:37,537 --> 00:40:39,408
What?
What man?

838
00:40:39,451 --> 00:40:41,453
Let's just say
when it comes to spies,

839
00:40:41,497 --> 00:40:43,325
I know he won't let me down.

840
00:40:43,368 --> 00:40:45,675
Now, you listen to me
and you listen good.

841
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:48,243
You work for me,
do you get that?

842
00:40:48,286 --> 00:40:50,550
You are my employee
and nothing more

843
00:40:50,593 --> 00:40:53,117
until this gets done.
Now, if you'll excuse me

844
00:40:53,161 --> 00:40:55,032
I have a long distance
phone call to make.

845
00:40:55,076 --> 00:40:56,730
No, wait, wait. No!

846
00:40:56,773 --> 00:40:58,601
Wait, wait! No!
Hello?

847
00:41:07,392 --> 00:41:11,396
# Burning, like my blood's
In a pan on a stove #

848
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,269
# And its heating me up
To the max #

849
00:41:14,312 --> 00:41:18,055
# So I'm running, my legs
As just fast as I can #

850
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:19,753
# To the left, to the right

851
00:41:19,796 --> 00:41:21,972
# I'm a frustrated man

852
00:41:22,016 --> 00:41:25,672
# Now I'm flicking my tiptoes
To kick up the sand #

853
00:41:25,715 --> 00:41:27,674
# 'Cause I can't understand

854
00:41:27,717 --> 00:41:32,200
# All these fire
That's raging inside me #

855
00:41:32,243 --> 00:41:35,943
# Seagulls in the sand
Can you hear my prayer #

856
00:41:35,986 --> 00:41:39,773
# I keep trying
But I'm getting nowhere #

857
00:41:39,816 --> 00:41:43,733
# Head's gonna fall now
Under her spell #

858
00:41:43,777 --> 00:41:48,129
# Am I in heaven
Or am I in hell #

859
00:41:49,696 --> 00:41:52,916
# Leaping, doing the splits
From my heart #

860
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,703
# Going higher and higher
My legs spread apart #

861
00:41:56,746 --> 00:42:00,663
# Now I'm twirling
Like a baby ballerina #

862
00:42:00,924 --> 00:42:04,406
# Who's digging a hole
With the force of his feet #

863
00:42:04,449 --> 00:42:06,190
# Watch me climbing

864
00:42:06,234 --> 00:42:10,455
# I'm going up a palm tree
Like a cat up a palm tree #

865
00:42:10,499 --> 00:42:14,808
# Who's decided
To go up a palm tree #

866
00:42:14,851 --> 00:42:18,507
# Seagull on the tire
Can you hear my prayer #

867
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:22,380
# I keep trying
But I'm getting nowhere #

868
00:42:22,424 --> 00:42:26,341
# Head's gonna fall now
Under her spell #

869
00:42:26,384 --> 00:42:32,390
# Am I in heaven
Or am I in hell #

870
00:42:32,434 --> 00:42:52,410
# Ooh...

871
00:42:52,454 --> 00:42:54,978
# Yeah, yeah, yeah

872
00:42:55,022 --> 00:43:01,811
- # Ooh
- # Ooh

873
00:43:03,073 --> 00:43:05,075
# Woman, I love you

874
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,731
# Seagulls in a group
Can you hear my prayer #

875
00:43:08,775 --> 00:43:12,604
# I keep trying
But I'm getting nowhere #

876
00:43:12,648 --> 00:43:16,521
# Head's gonna fall now
Under her spell #

877
00:43:16,565 --> 00:43:21,091
# This couldn't be heaven
I know #

878
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:24,747
# I'm in...

879
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:28,142
# Hell

880
00:43:32,233 --> 00:43:35,062
Phew! Well, I gotta be honest,

881
00:43:35,584 --> 00:43:37,499
I don't think I can do
another night like last night.

882
00:43:37,542 --> 00:43:39,501
- Oh.

883
00:43:39,544 --> 00:43:41,068
Me neither. My gosh.

884
00:43:41,677 --> 00:43:43,723
Although, you know,
Edgar was so nice.

885
00:43:43,766 --> 00:43:44,898
Who?

886
00:43:45,376 --> 00:43:48,292
Oh, um... Oh, was it Edgar?
What was his... that man's name?

887
00:43:48,553 --> 00:43:50,642
- Oh, I don't know.
- Hmm.

888
00:43:50,686 --> 00:43:52,296
- Oh, right. Edgar.
- Yeah.

889
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,515
From last night.

890
00:43:53,558 --> 00:43:55,604
Oh, I wasn't thinking
about him anymore.

891
00:43:55,647 --> 00:43:57,084
I forgot him.

892
00:43:57,127 --> 00:43:59,826
Me too. Yeah, I should forget
all about him.

893
00:44:01,044 --> 00:44:02,654
I think I just
wanna stay in tonight.

894
00:44:02,698 --> 00:44:05,135
Sit on the patio
and practice my calligraphy.

895
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:06,484
Maybe write a poem.

896
00:44:06,528 --> 00:44:08,791
And just have a couple
of wheat thins,

897
00:44:08,835 --> 00:44:10,706
- and just cool it.
- Oh, that's a nice idea.

898
00:44:11,054 --> 00:44:12,099
And I'm gonna take a bath.

899
00:44:12,621 --> 00:44:14,710
- Oh. I won't disturb you.
- And I will not disturb you.

900
00:44:15,842 --> 00:44:17,582
- Okay.
- I'm gonna get my stuff.

901
00:44:17,626 --> 00:44:18,801
Oh, here's my pen.

902
00:44:34,164 --> 00:44:35,644
Okay, I'm in the tub now.

903
00:44:39,517 --> 00:44:42,216
Dearest Edgar,
I hope you remember me.

904
00:44:42,259 --> 00:44:44,087
I'm the disgusting woman
from last night.

905
00:44:44,131 --> 00:44:45,523
Oh, gosh.

906
00:44:45,567 --> 00:44:48,135
Barb says I shouldn't
describe myself that way.

907
00:44:48,178 --> 00:44:51,268
You should know that
I've been hurt in the past.

908
00:44:51,312 --> 00:44:53,401
I'm a broken woman.

909
00:44:54,881 --> 00:44:56,752
I haven't written
my feelings down in so long,

910
00:44:56,796 --> 00:44:58,536
but, gosh,
you lit a fire in me

911
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,669
and I am raging with passion
right now.

912
00:45:02,714 --> 00:45:04,586
Okay? Where do I begin?
Um...

913
00:45:05,456 --> 00:45:09,417
I was born in a hospital...

914
00:45:14,204 --> 00:45:15,858
Ah. I get it.

915
00:45:19,906 --> 00:45:21,777
- Hello?
- Edgar Paget?

916
00:45:22,517 --> 00:45:25,389
- Uh, who is this?
- Never mind you.

917
00:45:26,347 --> 00:45:27,783
- Uh, what?
- For the purpose

918
00:45:27,827 --> 00:45:30,220
of our relationship,
I shall remain anonymous.

919
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:32,570
I'm an associate
of you know who.

920
00:45:32,614 --> 00:45:35,878
Oh. Um...
hello.

921
00:45:35,922 --> 00:45:38,054
I understand
you lost the microchip.

922
00:45:38,098 --> 00:45:40,100
You are in a bit of a conundrum.

923
00:45:40,143 --> 00:45:42,885
Fortunately, I'm the man
with the means to replace it.

924
00:45:42,929 --> 00:45:45,975
Don't ask me what they are.
That's private.

925
00:45:46,976 --> 00:45:48,673
- Okay.
- You'll hear from me.

926
00:45:48,717 --> 00:45:50,762
Wait for my call
from this private number

927
00:45:50,806 --> 00:45:53,156
I'm calling you from
right now privately.

928
00:45:53,983 --> 00:45:55,593
Actually, you know what,
you came...

929
00:45:55,637 --> 00:45:56,856
you came up on my...
on my phone.

930
00:45:57,247 --> 00:45:59,075
- I'm sorry. What?
- Your number actually

931
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:00,642
came up on my phone.

932
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:04,733
Damn it!
Well, don't look at it again.

933
00:46:04,776 --> 00:46:06,866
- I won't?
- Don't call it.

934
00:46:06,909 --> 00:46:08,302
I'm very private.

935
00:46:08,345 --> 00:46:10,391
- And don't give to anyone.
- Who will I give it to?

936
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,480
Listen, um,
when the number comes up,

937
00:46:12,523 --> 00:46:14,656
does it happen to say
the name Darlie Bunkle?

938
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,572
Uh, no. Is that your name?

939
00:46:17,615 --> 00:46:19,139
Damn it!

940
00:46:20,488 --> 00:46:21,489
What was that noise?

941
00:46:22,011 --> 00:46:23,970
Don't tell him it's me
on the phone. Darlie Bunkle.

942
00:46:24,013 --> 00:46:26,624
- Capital D-A-
- Oh, listen, I have to go.

943
00:46:26,668 --> 00:46:27,756
No, I have to go.

944
00:46:33,718 --> 00:46:34,719
Shit.

945
00:46:40,987 --> 00:46:41,944
Hey.

946
00:46:43,076 --> 00:46:44,120
Hi.

947
00:46:46,775 --> 00:46:49,386
I've been thinking about you
ever since this morning.

948
00:46:55,827 --> 00:46:58,004
- Shall I come in?
- Uh... no, no, no.

949
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,483
- Wait. Sorry. Um...
- Oh

950
00:46:59,527 --> 00:47:01,268
I got like work stuff
everywhere. It's a real mess.

951
00:47:01,311 --> 00:47:03,487
That's okay. I only have
a few minutes anyways.

952
00:47:03,531 --> 00:47:05,359
- Star thinks I'm in the tub.
- No, no. Wait, wait.

953
00:47:05,402 --> 00:47:07,361
Um, not here. Not here.
Let's not do it here.

954
00:47:07,404 --> 00:47:09,754
Let's, um... Let's go for a walk

955
00:47:09,798 --> 00:47:11,756
- Edgar.
- What?

956
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,149
- Okay.
- Okay.

957
00:47:14,194 --> 00:47:16,631
There's probably a lot
you wanna know about me.

958
00:47:16,674 --> 00:47:19,068
My husband's name
was Ron Quicksilver.

959
00:47:19,112 --> 00:47:20,417
He was a rodeo star.

960
00:47:21,201 --> 00:47:24,247
He was so manly, there were
rumors he was chemically off.

961
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:25,988
He was the love of my life.

962
00:47:27,294 --> 00:47:30,123
All I'm grateful for
is he died a quick death.

963
00:47:30,732 --> 00:47:31,951
He was trampled.

964
00:47:32,864 --> 00:47:35,171
- Oh, no. By a bull?
- No.

965
00:47:35,215 --> 00:47:37,739
It was a bunch of shoppers at
the Stereo Hut on Black Friday.

966
00:47:37,782 --> 00:47:39,741
They had 50-inch flat screens
for $199.

967
00:47:41,003 --> 00:47:42,570
I did get one.

968
00:47:42,613 --> 00:47:44,528
# Wrapped around each other... #

969
00:47:45,094 --> 00:47:47,792
I realized
your worst fears can come true.

970
00:47:48,576 --> 00:47:52,232
And I think maybe when Ron died,
I stopped living too. I mean,

971
00:47:52,275 --> 00:47:53,842
- I didn't really stop living.

972
00:47:53,885 --> 00:47:55,539
I'm not dead.
I'm not a ghost.

973
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:57,063
But after
that wild night with you,

974
00:47:57,106 --> 00:47:58,803
something shifted in me,
you know?

975
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,458
Something's changing. I...

976
00:48:01,502 --> 00:48:03,634
I wanna look at life
for the first time again

977
00:48:03,678 --> 00:48:04,766
like a baby.

978
00:48:05,201 --> 00:48:09,205
Gosh, I wanna be a baby again.
I was so flexible then.

979
00:48:09,249 --> 00:48:10,859
Star went as a baby
for Halloween once.

980
00:48:10,902 --> 00:48:13,079
She wore a diaper.
Only a diaper.

981
00:48:13,122 --> 00:48:15,037
She won best costume.

982
00:48:16,212 --> 00:48:19,172
Oh, my gosh.
Star, she thinks I'm in the tub.

983
00:48:20,303 --> 00:48:22,697
I lied to her
and I've never done that before.

984
00:48:23,654 --> 00:48:27,658
God, I'm a terrible friend.
I wasted all that water.

985
00:48:29,443 --> 00:48:33,490
Edgar, I'm sorry.
This can't happen.

986
00:48:35,231 --> 00:48:36,624
We weren't mean to be.

987
00:48:37,277 --> 00:48:40,019
You've set me free,
and that's all this was.

988
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,326
Thank you, Edgar.
Thank you!

989
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,502
You're welcome?

990
00:48:45,546 --> 00:48:48,027
Everything is possible!

991
00:48:53,075 --> 00:48:54,859
Oh, look at her.
She's asleep.

992
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,038
Star!

993
00:49:00,822 --> 00:49:01,823
Star!

994
00:49:03,433 --> 00:49:06,175
Okay. You're probably exhausted
from writing.

995
00:49:07,307 --> 00:49:10,179
Anyway, sweet dreams.
Good night, Star.

996
00:49:13,965 --> 00:49:15,271
I'm just so grateful for you!

997
00:49:15,315 --> 00:49:16,707
Gosh darn it,
you're a good friend.

998
00:49:16,751 --> 00:49:19,058
That's all.
Good night, Star!

999
00:49:28,241 --> 00:49:29,242
Hi.

1000
00:49:30,591 --> 00:49:31,592
Hi.

1001
00:49:37,598 --> 00:49:39,382
I started writing you a letter,
but then,

1002
00:49:39,426 --> 00:49:41,123
my gosh, I was thinking
about you so much,

1003
00:49:41,167 --> 00:49:43,560
my brain just
got all squirrelly.

1004
00:49:43,604 --> 00:49:45,519
I just...
wanted to come over and...

1005
00:49:46,737 --> 00:49:48,826
talked to you inside
where your sheets are.

1006
00:49:53,179 --> 00:49:54,876
His name is Carmine Testaviglio.

1007
00:49:54,919 --> 00:49:57,313
I should've known he was
having an affair with Dina.

1008
00:49:57,357 --> 00:49:59,185
I didn't stand a chance.

1009
00:49:59,228 --> 00:50:02,666
Carmine had a foot fetish,
and Dina has huge toes.

1010
00:50:03,319 --> 00:50:05,191
My toes stopped growing
after I was three months old.

1011
00:50:05,234 --> 00:50:07,845
They're like little pieces
of rice. I'm not kidding.

1012
00:50:08,759 --> 00:50:10,761
- Oh, God, don't look.
- I wasn't.

1013
00:50:11,936 --> 00:50:13,982
# Wrapped around each other... #

1014
00:50:15,114 --> 00:50:17,333
Now, when someone
leaves you, you just think,

1015
00:50:17,377 --> 00:50:19,074
"So there must be
something wrong with me."

1016
00:50:19,118 --> 00:50:21,032
So I just figured
I'm disgusting.

1017
00:50:21,076 --> 00:50:23,861
But that night with you
was the first time since Carmine

1018
00:50:23,905 --> 00:50:25,863
I felt non-disgusting.

1019
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,692
I mean, you saw
my folds and holes

1020
00:50:28,736 --> 00:50:30,694
- and you didn't run away.

1021
00:50:31,086 --> 00:50:32,740
Now, I'm just starting
to realize that maybe

1022
00:50:32,783 --> 00:50:34,916
having meaningless flings
is the way to go.

1023
00:50:35,438 --> 00:50:37,527
No one gets hurt.
No strings attached.

1024
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,662
It's just you shouldn't have
to try to make someone love you.

1025
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,533
That's all.
I don't know.

1026
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,146
I know what you mean.

1027
00:50:48,103 --> 00:50:49,104
You do?

1028
00:50:52,151 --> 00:50:55,023
Plus, you put all your faith
in someone and, poof,

1029
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,721
they turn out
to be someone else.

1030
00:50:57,765 --> 00:50:59,593
I once heard this story
about a woman

1031
00:50:59,636 --> 00:51:01,812
who married a doctor,
turns out

1032
00:51:01,856 --> 00:51:03,553
he was Bruce Springsteen.

1033
00:51:03,597 --> 00:51:05,512
I guess he just wanted
to be a regular person

1034
00:51:05,555 --> 00:51:07,166
for a little while or something.

1035
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,516
I remember one year
for Halloween,

1036
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:11,300
Barb went as Bruce Springsteen.

1037
00:51:12,127 --> 00:51:14,173
Oh, my God. Barb.

1038
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:17,567
What am I doing?
She thinks I'm sleeping.

1039
00:51:17,611 --> 00:51:20,527
I lied to her, and I think
she might have feelings for you.

1040
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:23,182
- Oh, no. I don't think she...
- I've been a terrible friend.

1041
00:51:23,225 --> 00:51:24,879
And I ruined that pillow.

1042
00:51:25,923 --> 00:51:28,274
Oh, Edgar...
I should go.

1043
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:30,624
Which means
we don't have a lot of time.

1044
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:32,103
Gosh, I need you inside me.

1045
00:51:32,147 --> 00:51:34,715
Let's go make love against
those hard wooden stairs.

1046
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:43,941
Edgar. Oh, thanks for letting me
talk through this

1047
00:51:43,985 --> 00:51:45,595
and letting me
ride you like that.

1048
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:48,207
Now, I get meaningless sex.

1049
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:50,513
It feels good physically,
and that's all.

1050
00:51:50,557 --> 00:51:51,949
Star that was...

1051
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:55,997
that was amazing.

1052
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,262
I mean, it was really,
really different.

1053
00:52:00,306 --> 00:52:02,308
- Did I bounce too much?
- No.

1054
00:52:02,351 --> 00:52:03,352
Oh, good.

1055
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:05,615
That was so lovely.

1056
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,096
Listen, I really
have to get back.

1057
00:52:08,139 --> 00:52:10,011
Barb, can never know about this.

1058
00:52:10,054 --> 00:52:11,534
Gosh, gotta go.

1059
00:52:14,494 --> 00:52:16,974
- Let's do it one more time.
- Oh, yup. Yup. Please.

1060
00:52:48,441 --> 00:52:49,790
What are you doing?

1061
00:52:51,444 --> 00:52:53,054
Oh, I was just playing
with this lamp.

1062
00:52:53,097 --> 00:52:55,143
- Oh.
- I got a little reflux.

1063
00:52:55,186 --> 00:52:56,318
And I tried to wake you,

1064
00:52:56,362 --> 00:52:58,189
but I saw you put a pillow
in the bed.

1065
00:52:58,233 --> 00:53:01,323
Was that just a funny joke?
I laughed but then I wondered.

1066
00:53:01,671 --> 00:53:04,021
Oh, um, I just didn't wanna
make you up.

1067
00:53:04,805 --> 00:53:08,374
You know, I didn't know
how long I was gonna be out.

1068
00:53:08,417 --> 00:53:09,679
Oh, thank God.

1069
00:53:10,114 --> 00:53:12,421
I thought maybe you went down
to the ocean and got swept away.

1070
00:53:12,465 --> 00:53:14,118
Where did you go?

1071
00:53:14,162 --> 00:53:15,772
I just went out
to clear my head.

1072
00:53:15,816 --> 00:53:19,036
You know, get some of that
salty breeze in my lungs.

1073
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,343
- Okay.
- And went for a walk with...

1074
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:25,129
a turtle.

1075
00:53:26,348 --> 00:53:27,697
- A turtle?
- You know, I just

1076
00:53:28,002 --> 00:53:31,832
wanna make sure he was safe,
so I-I... made sure he got home.

1077
00:53:32,354 --> 00:53:34,878
You went to a turtle's house?

1078
00:53:34,922 --> 00:53:36,489
I went to a turtle's house.

1079
00:53:36,532 --> 00:53:38,447
Where do they
live around here?

1080
00:53:38,491 --> 00:53:41,102
Oh, over by bushes.
How was your bath?

1081
00:53:41,711 --> 00:53:42,756
Oh.

1082
00:53:44,061 --> 00:53:46,150
- It was good. Good tub.
- Good.

1083
00:53:46,673 --> 00:53:49,545
I just stayed in there,
the whole time.

1084
00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:50,981
Well, good for you.

1085
00:53:51,025 --> 00:53:55,246
Well, I was really relaxed,
and the water was warm.

1086
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:57,814
And I...

1087
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,600
saw a turtle.

1088
00:54:00,643 --> 00:54:02,515
In the tub?

1089
00:54:02,558 --> 00:54:03,864
Yup. A baby one.

1090
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,779
He just floated up
out of the drain,

1091
00:54:05,822 --> 00:54:08,129
and he swam around,
and he splashed me.

1092
00:54:08,172 --> 00:54:09,391
And I tried to pet him,

1093
00:54:09,435 --> 00:54:11,350
- but he got scared.
- 'Cause you're big?

1094
00:54:11,393 --> 00:54:13,917
So much bigger than him.
He went back down.

1095
00:54:13,961 --> 00:54:17,138
And, uh, anyway, that's why
you can't see him right now.

1096
00:54:18,052 --> 00:54:19,749
- Wow.

1097
00:54:21,185 --> 00:54:22,491
We should probably hit the hay.

1098
00:54:22,535 --> 00:54:24,275
Yes. Let's go to bed.
I'm tired.

1099
00:54:27,409 --> 00:54:30,412
Anyway, I'm so happy
to be here with you.

1100
00:54:30,456 --> 00:54:32,588
Well, I'm so happy
to be here with you.

1101
00:54:33,633 --> 00:54:35,765
- Good night.
- Good night, Star.

1102
00:55:02,531 --> 00:55:03,837
Yoyo.

1103
00:55:04,707 --> 00:55:06,274
- I love it.

1104
00:55:06,317 --> 00:55:08,232
I'm so happy I built you
that craft room.

1105
00:55:09,016 --> 00:55:11,453
Now, let's go over the plan
one last time.

1106
00:55:11,497 --> 00:55:13,237
- Are you ready?
- Why does this plan

1107
00:55:13,281 --> 00:55:14,717
mean so much to you, huh?

1108
00:55:14,761 --> 00:55:17,024
Oh, Yoyo.

1109
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,331
Bring me my chair.

1110
00:55:21,028 --> 00:55:22,203
Where shall I begin?

1111
00:55:23,509 --> 00:55:25,119
I was born here in Taylorsville.

1112
00:55:26,033 --> 00:55:29,123
I was also born with a skin
condition the doctors called

1113
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:33,257
pigmentatia-degenera-hysterica- whiteskinika.

1114
00:55:33,301 --> 00:55:35,085
Is it serious?

1115
00:55:35,129 --> 00:55:37,697
It is serious. You have
to take care of yourself.

1116
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,350
You have to stay
out of the sunlight.

1117
00:55:39,394 --> 00:55:41,962
Leaving me
forever allergic to the sun.

1118
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,095
When I was seven years old,
my father got a job

1119
00:55:45,139 --> 00:55:46,880
that would change our lives.

1120
00:55:46,923 --> 00:55:48,838
We packed up and moved
to a small town

1121
00:55:48,882 --> 00:55:50,405
in Florida called...

1122
00:55:51,754 --> 00:55:53,321
Vista Del Mar.

1123
00:55:54,191 --> 00:55:56,672
At my new school,
everyone made fun of me

1124
00:55:56,716 --> 00:55:58,282
because of the way
that I looked.

1125
00:55:58,326 --> 00:55:59,632
They would call me names like...

1126
00:55:59,675 --> 00:56:00,807
- pale girl...
- Pale girl.

1127
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:02,896
- ...white devil...
- White devil.

1128
00:56:02,939 --> 00:56:04,637
- ...and asshole.
- Asshole.

1129
00:56:05,246 --> 00:56:07,466
I finally made one friend.

1130
00:56:07,509 --> 00:56:09,816
Her name was Maria Margolis.

1131
00:56:11,078 --> 00:56:13,036
She would stay inside with me.

1132
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,561
We would read
and create inventions,

1133
00:56:15,604 --> 00:56:16,997
cook food from her culture.

1134
00:56:17,606 --> 00:56:20,043
Then one day as we were walking to hercasa,

1135
00:56:20,087 --> 00:56:21,654
through the Vista Del Mar
swamps,

1136
00:56:23,656 --> 00:56:26,485
an alligator jumped out
of the water and ate Maria

1137
00:56:26,528 --> 00:56:28,922
- right in front of me.

1138
00:56:28,965 --> 00:56:30,489
Really gobbled her up.

1139
00:56:32,926 --> 00:56:34,841
She was my last friend.

1140
00:56:35,755 --> 00:56:37,887
Years later,
my father convinced me

1141
00:56:37,931 --> 00:56:41,935
to go to Vista Del Mar's
annual Seafood Jam.

1142
00:56:42,544 --> 00:56:44,677
I remember looking up
on the stage

1143
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,505
at the four young pretty girls.

1144
00:56:47,027 --> 00:56:49,682
One of them about to be crowned
the new Shrimp Queen.

1145
00:56:51,118 --> 00:56:52,554
And then all of a sudden...

1146
00:56:53,294 --> 00:56:54,861
a group of popular girls

1147
00:56:54,904 --> 00:56:56,863
from my school
pushed me on to the stage...

1148
00:56:58,386 --> 00:57:01,607
...ripping my hat off, replacing it with a fake crown.

1149
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:03,173
- No. No.
- Father was trying

1150
00:57:03,217 --> 00:57:05,175
to get to the front,
but he couldn't

1151
00:57:05,219 --> 00:57:06,873
before the elderly mayor
mistook me

1152
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:09,702
for the actual Shrimp Queen and proceeded with the tradition.

1153
00:57:10,441 --> 00:57:12,531
He shoved me
into the human cannon.

1154
00:57:13,401 --> 00:57:18,406
Then one of the girls turned the dial all the way up.

1155
00:57:18,449 --> 00:57:20,190
I was shot out into the ocean.

1156
00:57:22,279 --> 00:57:23,759
As I rocketed
through the air,

1157
00:57:23,803 --> 00:57:26,327
the force of the wind
ripped off all of my clothes.

1158
00:57:26,936 --> 00:57:28,721
And I landed in the water...

1159
00:57:28,764 --> 00:57:30,113
of a pool...

1160
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,421
- of a Disney Cruise Ship.

1161
00:57:33,464 --> 00:57:36,119
And there I was,
a laughing stock.

1162
00:57:36,163 --> 00:57:39,862
Bobbing in the water like
a ball of fresh mozzarella.

1163
00:57:41,385 --> 00:57:43,431
From all the guilt
and the stress,

1164
00:57:43,474 --> 00:57:45,607
my poor father
suffered a heart attack.

1165
00:57:46,173 --> 00:57:48,305
And my mother abandoned me
to reinvent herself

1166
00:57:48,349 --> 00:57:51,395
in Palm Springs.
And after all that,

1167
00:57:51,439 --> 00:57:53,180
I knew someday,

1168
00:57:54,311 --> 00:57:56,966
I would get revenge
on that small town.

1169
00:57:57,576 --> 00:58:00,230
And everyone
that chose to live in it.

1170
00:58:01,405 --> 00:58:06,541
That dreadful town
that ruined my life

1171
00:58:07,803 --> 00:58:11,241
and cost me everything.

1172
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:16,029
I think your feelings are valid
and this is the only answer.

1173
00:58:16,072 --> 00:58:17,160
Thank you, Yoyo.

1174
00:58:17,465 --> 00:58:19,423
But we have to get another
microchip to Edgar.

1175
00:58:19,467 --> 00:58:20,729
We're running out of time.

1176
00:58:20,773 --> 00:58:22,731
Oh, don't worry about that.

1177
00:58:23,558 --> 00:58:26,648
Plan B is in already in motion.

1178
00:58:29,999 --> 00:58:32,262
# Boobies on vacation #

1179
00:58:32,654 --> 00:58:34,874
# Boobies in the afternoon #

1180
00:58:35,483 --> 00:58:37,877
# Boobies at the hotel buffet #

1181
00:58:38,268 --> 00:58:40,967
# Bouncing all over the room #

1182
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:42,011
# Boobies

1183
00:58:42,969 --> 00:58:44,448
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1184
00:58:44,492 --> 00:58:46,581
It's me. We spoke on the phone.

1185
00:58:47,713 --> 00:58:48,801
Darlie Bunkle?

1186
00:58:48,844 --> 00:58:51,064
Shoot!
I forgot you knew my name.

1187
00:58:51,107 --> 00:58:53,675
Yeah, it's me, Darlie Bunkle.
205 Pagoda Drive.

1188
00:58:54,415 --> 00:58:55,677
Is that your address?

1189
00:58:55,721 --> 00:58:58,201
Damn it!
That was private.

1190
00:58:58,245 --> 00:59:00,421
So, any idea when you think
the microchip will be ready?

1191
00:59:00,464 --> 00:59:03,032
- It's ready. I have a plan.
- Good.

1192
00:59:03,467 --> 00:59:05,469
A piece of paper
will be slipped under your door

1193
00:59:05,513 --> 00:59:08,037
naming the time and the place
for the drop off.

1194
00:59:08,081 --> 00:59:10,953
It will lined notebook paper
with frayed edges.

1195
00:59:10,997 --> 00:59:13,652
Letters will be small
because the message is private.

1196
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:17,220
Why don't you
just tell it to me now

1197
00:59:17,264 --> 00:59:19,483
instead of having
to come back here later on?

1198
00:59:24,663 --> 00:59:27,448
Listen, Edgar, I've been
thinking about your idea.

1199
00:59:28,101 --> 00:59:30,146
You know, the one where I just
tell you where we're meeting

1200
00:59:30,581 --> 00:59:32,496
instead of me driving
a piece of paper to you

1201
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:33,584
- wherever you are later.
- Yeah.

1202
00:59:33,846 --> 00:59:36,065
And I like it. I like it.

1203
00:59:37,327 --> 00:59:39,286
I'll meet you outside
your hotel room

1204
00:59:39,329 --> 00:59:40,853
probably at sundown.

1205
00:59:40,896 --> 00:59:42,768
When you see me next,
I'll be wearing a large

1206
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,032
purple Zorro-style fedora
and the rest I don't know yet

1207
00:59:46,075 --> 00:59:48,730
but I love colors, all of them.

1208
00:59:48,774 --> 00:59:50,297
All right. I mean,
you're the expert. Okay.

1209
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:53,256
Thank you. I am. Yeah,
I'm gonna sneak out subtly,

1210
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,736
show you how it's done.

1211
01:00:02,657 --> 01:00:03,832
Damn it!

1212
01:00:05,704 --> 01:00:07,836
Bard, look. A banana boat.

1213
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,533
I can't wait for us
to go on that together.

1214
01:00:09,577 --> 01:00:10,709
Yeah.

1215
01:00:10,752 --> 01:00:12,841
Ladies, I know
I've said this a lot,

1216
01:00:12,885 --> 01:00:14,408
but it's really hard
to draw your faces

1217
01:00:14,451 --> 01:00:15,496
when you keep talking.

1218
01:00:16,062 --> 01:00:17,803
- Sorry. Enough said. Yes.
- I'm sorry. Sorry about that.

1219
01:00:17,846 --> 01:00:20,675
Apologize.
What is she drawing?

1220
01:00:20,719 --> 01:00:22,024
- I don't know.
- You just did it.

1221
01:00:22,068 --> 01:00:23,156
- You moved your head again.
- I'm a caricature.

1222
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:24,287
The suspense is killing me.

1223
01:00:24,331 --> 01:00:25,419
I hope she
gives me bigger teeth.

1224
01:00:25,462 --> 01:00:26,899
- Love big teeth.
- She loves big teeth.

1225
01:00:26,942 --> 01:00:28,030
- Good to know.
- I just like how

1226
01:00:28,335 --> 01:00:30,946
everything is accentuated
in the caricatures.

1227
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:33,688
So, feel free to make my teeth
as big as you want.

1228
01:00:33,732 --> 01:00:36,212
Like just real big. Like,
even if it's just two eyes

1229
01:00:36,256 --> 01:00:37,866
and a bunch of teeth,
that would be...

1230
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:39,781
Barb. Um, uh...

1231
01:00:39,825 --> 01:00:42,349
Gosh! All of a sudden, I'm...
I'm not feeling so good.

1232
01:00:42,828 --> 01:00:45,004
Oh. Oh, no. Are you...
are you okay?

1233
01:00:45,047 --> 01:00:47,223
I don't know. No.
I think I have the flu.

1234
01:00:47,267 --> 01:00:49,573
I think I should go lay down
in the room or something.

1235
01:00:49,617 --> 01:00:51,314
Oh, Star. Do you want me
to come with you?

1236
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:52,838
No. I don't wanna ruin your day.

1237
01:00:52,881 --> 01:00:54,056
Just, uh, go snorkeling?

1238
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,015
Snorkeling? In the ocean
with the currents?

1239
01:00:56,058 --> 01:00:57,625
- Oh, I couldn't do that.
- Oh.

1240
01:00:57,668 --> 01:00:59,409
Plus, we said we were
gonna do these things together.

1241
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:01,411
I'll just wait for you
to get better.

1242
01:01:01,455 --> 01:01:03,500
Probably a few hours or so.
I'm feeling very faint.

1243
01:01:03,544 --> 01:01:05,198
But, um, I'll see you...
I'll see you then.

1244
01:01:05,241 --> 01:01:07,591
- All right. I'm done.
- Star.

1245
01:01:07,635 --> 01:01:09,550
And there you go. Enjoy.

1246
01:01:10,725 --> 01:01:12,814
I can see where the talking
was problematic.

1247
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:15,425
Uh-hmm.
That's what your face was doing.

1248
01:01:28,961 --> 01:01:29,918
You want in?

1249
01:01:29,962 --> 01:01:32,268
Oh, no. No, thanks.

1250
01:02:01,689 --> 01:02:04,997
There's a current, everyone!
There's a current!

1251
01:02:05,562 --> 01:02:06,737
Oh, my God. Waves.

1252
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:11,917
# Pineapple princess

1253
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,789
# He calls me
Pineapple princess all day #

1254
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:19,794
# As he plays his ukulele
On the hill above the bay #

1255
01:02:19,838 --> 01:02:24,190
# I saw a boy on Oahu isle

1256
01:02:24,755 --> 01:02:28,411
# Floatin' down the bay
On a crocodile #

1257
01:02:28,455 --> 01:02:30,239
# He waved at me

1258
01:02:30,283 --> 01:02:32,720
# And he swam ashore

1259
01:02:32,763 --> 01:02:36,332
# And I knew he'd be mine
Forevermore #

1260
01:02:36,985 --> 01:02:38,595
# Pineapple princess

1261
01:02:38,639 --> 01:02:41,424
# He calls me
Pineapple princess all day #

1262
01:02:41,468 --> 01:02:45,559
# As he plays his ukulele
On the hill above the bay #

1263
01:02:45,907 --> 01:02:48,257
# Pineapple princess,
I love you #

1264
01:02:48,301 --> 01:02:50,520
# You're the sweetest girl
I've seen #

1265
01:02:50,564 --> 01:02:52,827
# Someday we're gonna marry

1266
01:02:52,871 --> 01:02:54,873
# And you'll be
My pineapple queen #

1267
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:00,574
Oh.

1268
01:03:07,537 --> 01:03:09,235
- Oh, no!

1269
01:03:09,278 --> 01:03:11,933
How are you feeling?
Let me check.

1270
01:03:12,934 --> 01:03:15,632
Oh. Yup. It's fever.
A hundred and thirty-seven.

1271
01:03:15,937 --> 01:03:18,070
- Oh.
- You better rest.

1272
01:03:18,722 --> 01:03:21,247
Look at you. Looks like
you're getting a little tan.

1273
01:03:21,508 --> 01:03:22,901
Oh.

1274
01:03:25,294 --> 01:03:26,905
There's a skylight
in the business center.

1275
01:03:26,948 --> 01:03:27,949
Oh.

1276
01:03:27,993 --> 01:03:29,429
I've been
in the business center.

1277
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:30,909
- Okay. Well, I better... Gosh!
- I don't wanna give you

1278
01:03:30,952 --> 01:03:32,345
- what I have.
- I'm gonna let you get you rest.

1279
01:03:32,388 --> 01:03:34,042
- Contagious. I'm so sick.
- Yeah.

1280
01:03:34,086 --> 01:03:35,783
Yeah, I'll check in
with you later.

1281
01:03:35,826 --> 01:03:39,265
# He sings his song
From banana trees #

1282
01:03:39,308 --> 01:03:43,530
# He even sings to me
On his water skis #

1283
01:03:43,573 --> 01:03:47,926
# We went skin-divin'
And beneath the blue #

1284
01:03:47,969 --> 01:03:51,407
# He sang and played
His ukulele too #

1285
01:03:52,017 --> 01:03:54,497
# Pineapple princess
I love you #

1286
01:03:54,541 --> 01:03:56,935
# You're the sweetest girl
I've seen #

1287
01:03:56,978 --> 01:03:58,937
# Someday we're gonna marry

1288
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:00,982
# And you'll be
My pineapple queen #

1289
01:04:01,026 --> 01:04:04,246
Woo!
This is living!

1290
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:06,335
Woo!

1291
01:04:11,253 --> 01:04:13,386
Mm.

1292
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:16,476
These just arrived.

1293
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:26,051
Well, looks like Edgar
is distracting himself.

1294
01:04:26,877 --> 01:04:27,878
Hmm.

1295
01:04:29,663 --> 01:04:31,578
Well, she is beautiful.

1296
01:04:32,492 --> 01:04:34,407
You want me
to take care of them?

1297
01:04:35,234 --> 01:04:38,585
No, Yoyo.
I'll handle this.

1298
01:04:48,203 --> 01:04:50,814
Ow! Oh, my... Ow!

1299
01:04:51,815 --> 01:04:54,601
- Here!
- Oh, my.

1300
01:04:54,644 --> 01:04:55,950
Take my calloused hand.

1301
01:04:58,344 --> 01:05:00,694
Oh.
That's very calloused.

1302
01:05:00,737 --> 01:05:03,044
Wow! Feels like barnacles.

1303
01:05:03,088 --> 01:05:05,220
Oh, yeah. I fell on my elbow.

1304
01:05:05,264 --> 01:05:07,222
It's all right.
It'll be fine.

1305
01:05:07,266 --> 01:05:10,399
What is such a beautiful woman
doing all alone out here?

1306
01:05:11,226 --> 01:05:12,532
in the sticks?

1307
01:05:13,141 --> 01:05:16,188
Oh. I'm just changing
into my regular clothes.

1308
01:05:16,231 --> 01:05:18,668
I... I'm sorry.
I thought it was private here.

1309
01:05:18,712 --> 01:05:19,843
Give me your arm.

1310
01:05:19,887 --> 01:05:21,149
- What?
- Your arm.

1311
01:05:21,193 --> 01:05:22,063
Oh.

1312
01:05:23,847 --> 01:05:24,848
Thank you.

1313
01:05:26,024 --> 01:05:27,851
What do you mean
regular clothes?

1314
01:05:27,895 --> 01:05:29,592
It's a long story.
I'm on vacation,

1315
01:05:29,636 --> 01:05:31,159
and my friend is sick,

1316
01:05:31,203 --> 01:05:33,074
and I've been pretending
that I'm doing nothing,

1317
01:05:33,118 --> 01:05:34,989
but I've been doing everything.

1318
01:05:35,033 --> 01:05:36,338
Anyway, I feel bad.

1319
01:05:36,643 --> 01:05:39,037
But I have to admit, I also
have never felt more alive.

1320
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,212
Am I a bad friend?

1321
01:05:40,777 --> 01:05:42,083
You could only be a friend

1322
01:05:42,127 --> 01:05:44,042
if you're a friend
to yourself first.

1323
01:05:44,085 --> 01:05:45,782
That is where you find
your truth.

1324
01:05:46,087 --> 01:05:47,654
What if I don't know my truth?

1325
01:05:47,697 --> 01:05:49,830
- What if you do?
- Oh.

1326
01:05:49,873 --> 01:05:52,050
You are finding
your courage, your voice.

1327
01:05:52,833 --> 01:05:55,096
- You're being delivered.
- I am?

1328
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:57,185
It is time to mount the wind
and ride it

1329
01:05:57,229 --> 01:06:00,145
with the fierceness
of a hippopotamus.

1330
01:06:01,537 --> 01:06:02,538
Okay.

1331
01:06:03,191 --> 01:06:04,540
- Ha-hoya!
- Oh.

1332
01:06:05,889 --> 01:06:08,631
- You are rising.
- Oh, my God.

1333
01:06:08,675 --> 01:06:12,113
Your truth is
that you are a phoenix.

1334
01:06:13,506 --> 01:06:15,508
Dumbledore's bird.

1335
01:06:16,161 --> 01:06:18,728
- Who?
- Dumbledore.

1336
01:06:19,468 --> 01:06:23,081
I must leave now...
to finish my swamp walk.

1337
01:06:24,343 --> 01:06:28,086
Remember, your shimmer
is on the horizon.

1338
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,612
My shimmer?
How did you know that?

1339
01:06:33,308 --> 01:06:34,570
It's what I do.

1340
01:06:36,355 --> 01:06:38,966
Wait. Sir, I'm sorry,
what was your name.

1341
01:06:39,836 --> 01:06:41,099
The name is Tommy.

1342
01:06:42,622 --> 01:06:43,797
Tommy Bahama.

1343
01:06:51,761 --> 01:06:53,154
What the fu...

1344
01:06:53,198 --> 01:06:54,808
- Bless you.

1345
01:06:54,851 --> 01:06:55,983
Thank you.

1346
01:06:57,463 --> 01:07:00,727
Edgar, what are we gonna do
when this trip is over?

1347
01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:02,685
Let's not talk about the future.

1348
01:07:02,729 --> 01:07:04,426
I just wanna spend
every moment we have

1349
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:07,299
discovering different levels
of specialness in you.

1350
01:07:07,342 --> 01:07:09,388
Oh, you're so amazing.

1351
01:07:09,431 --> 01:07:11,607
I have so many feelings
in my heart.

1352
01:07:11,651 --> 01:07:13,131
Just incredible and amazing.

1353
01:07:13,174 --> 01:07:14,523
I have those feelings too.

1354
01:07:20,747 --> 01:07:22,836
You've been pleasuring me
a lot lately.

1355
01:07:22,879 --> 01:07:25,317
In that last position,
your dong went really deep.

1356
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:28,711
I think your dong
went all the way up and...

1357
01:07:30,148 --> 01:07:31,410
touched my heart.

1358
01:07:32,585 --> 01:07:33,890
So, what do we do now?

1359
01:07:33,934 --> 01:07:35,414
I mean, do you still just want

1360
01:07:35,457 --> 01:07:37,590
meaningless flings
or something more...

1361
01:07:37,633 --> 01:07:38,504
Official?

1362
01:07:40,114 --> 01:07:41,115
What?

1363
01:07:42,464 --> 01:07:43,683
Oh, Star!

1364
01:07:52,344 --> 01:07:55,390
Oh, I have to go. I have...
I have a business meeting.

1365
01:07:55,434 --> 01:07:57,218
Oh, business meeting.

1366
01:07:57,262 --> 01:07:59,916
Oh, no. I wish I could tell you
more about my job,

1367
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,353
- but...
- No. No. Come on.

1368
01:08:01,396 --> 01:08:04,007
What else is there to know?
You're a clam inspector,

1369
01:08:04,051 --> 01:08:05,661
and you're in town
on top business.

1370
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,061
Okay.

1371
01:08:25,377 --> 01:08:28,206
Gosh, he smells so good.

1372
01:08:29,816 --> 01:08:30,947
Is this right?

1373
01:08:31,687 --> 01:08:33,733
What about Barb?

1374
01:08:36,039 --> 01:08:37,911
I'm in a big pickle,
little crab.

1375
01:08:39,869 --> 01:08:41,175
What am I gonna do?

1376
01:08:42,959 --> 01:08:46,615
Go with your heart.
Love is rare.

1377
01:08:47,225 --> 01:08:48,922
True friends forgive.

1378
01:08:50,053 --> 01:08:52,404
Oh. Well, that makes me
feel better.

1379
01:08:52,447 --> 01:08:54,101
- I...
- To a point.

1380
01:08:54,144 --> 01:08:57,670
Well, it depends what you do
and how long your lie lasts.

1381
01:08:58,018 --> 01:09:00,107
Now, if you really
"F" her over,

1382
01:09:00,150 --> 01:09:02,457
she is not gonna talk
to you again.

1383
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:06,287
Oh. Well, thanks a lot.

1384
01:09:07,723 --> 01:09:10,030
Shoot!
I should probably get going.

1385
01:09:10,073 --> 01:09:11,074
The name's Morgan.

1386
01:09:11,553 --> 01:09:14,034
Morgan Freemond, with a "D."

1387
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:17,080
Okay.
Well, maybe I'll see you around.

1388
01:09:17,124 --> 01:09:19,387
You won't.

1389
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,869
I am going
into the ocean tonight

1390
01:09:22,912 --> 01:09:24,871
and I shall never return.

1391
01:09:25,611 --> 01:09:28,091
Oh, I have lived a full life.

1392
01:09:28,135 --> 01:09:31,965
Bathed in the sun.
Slept in the sand.

1393
01:09:32,008 --> 01:09:36,012
I was in jail.
Even drove an old lady around,

1394
01:09:36,056 --> 01:09:39,320
and taught her about tolerance
and true friendship.

1395
01:09:39,364 --> 01:09:41,670
But that kid is long gone.

1396
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:45,239
This old crab
is all that's left.

1397
01:09:48,155 --> 01:09:50,592
Goodbye, me.

1398
01:10:02,038 --> 01:10:04,389
Psst! Get me tonight.
I'm having a yard sale.

1399
01:10:04,432 --> 01:10:06,086
And it's going better
than I thought.

1400
01:10:06,129 --> 01:10:09,655
So, the microchip is inside.
Keep it private.

1401
01:10:09,698 --> 01:10:13,006
Darlie Bunkle. Age, 41.
Weight, 179. Damn it!

1402
01:10:16,836 --> 01:10:18,577
Oh, my gosh.

1403
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:20,318
I love this place.

1404
01:10:20,361 --> 01:10:22,058
I love this bar.
I love the food.

1405
01:10:22,102 --> 01:10:25,714
I love the way Richard's music
always lift my spirits. Oh!

1406
01:10:25,758 --> 01:10:27,934
# Several of my friends
From high school #

1407
01:10:27,977 --> 01:10:30,415
# Have recently passed

1408
01:10:31,677 --> 01:10:34,332
# Seth, Gabe, Grant
All dead... #

1409
01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:38,074
That one's a little dark,
but I love it here.

1410
01:10:38,118 --> 01:10:39,380
We love having you, Barb.

1411
01:10:39,424 --> 01:10:40,947
Aw, that's so sweet.

1412
01:10:40,990 --> 01:10:42,035
Hey, Barb.

1413
01:10:42,078 --> 01:10:43,776
- Jeff.
- Ready for the banana boat?

1414
01:10:43,819 --> 01:10:45,125
- Oh, yes.
- All right.

1415
01:10:45,168 --> 01:10:46,561
Gosh! I forgot
we were doing this.

1416
01:10:46,605 --> 01:10:47,997
- Put this on.
- Is it okay

1417
01:10:48,041 --> 01:10:49,738
if I just wear my culottes?
I forgot.

1418
01:10:49,782 --> 01:10:51,261
- Yeah.
- Great.

1419
01:10:51,305 --> 01:10:52,872
Just helping you ready
'cause you're in

1420
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:54,134
for a real tit flapper.

1421
01:10:54,177 --> 01:10:55,918
Jeff, really?

1422
01:10:55,962 --> 01:10:57,398
It's what it does.

1423
01:10:57,442 --> 01:10:59,400
Your skin jiggles,
your tits start flapping.

1424
01:10:59,444 --> 01:11:02,360
- Anyway, after you.
- Oh, okay.

1425
01:11:02,403 --> 01:11:03,796
Oh, I'm so excited.

1426
01:11:03,839 --> 01:11:05,406
I'm, you know,
feeling a little guilty.

1427
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:07,756
I supposed to be doing this
with Star.

1428
01:11:08,627 --> 01:11:09,584
You know what?

1429
01:11:09,889 --> 01:11:12,152
I'm gonna wait
till she's feeling better,

1430
01:11:12,195 --> 01:11:13,588
'cause this the one thing

1431
01:11:13,632 --> 01:11:16,548
that we really, really,
really wanted to do together.

1432
01:11:19,202 --> 01:11:20,073
Star?

1433
01:11:23,772 --> 01:11:24,904
Ya-ya-yow!

1434
01:11:27,907 --> 01:11:28,995
That's hot.

1435
01:11:34,304 --> 01:11:36,002
Look, Star, I...

1436
01:11:37,133 --> 01:11:38,221
I really like you.

1437
01:11:38,265 --> 01:11:40,702
Oh, my God.
Yes, I will.

1438
01:11:41,573 --> 01:11:42,965
- What?
- Hmm?

1439
01:11:44,010 --> 01:11:47,970
Oh. Oh. Nothing. Never mind.
I thought you were... It wasn't.

1440
01:11:48,362 --> 01:11:50,799
It's not. It's okay.
Never mind.

1441
01:11:50,843 --> 01:11:53,236
- My head is just a little...

1442
01:11:55,848 --> 01:11:56,979
That's my cell phone.

1443
01:11:57,023 --> 01:11:58,764
- Oh. Phew!
- Yeah.

1444
01:12:00,330 --> 01:12:03,333
It's work.
I should probably take this.

1445
01:12:03,377 --> 01:12:04,378
Okay.

1446
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:05,858
See each other soon?

1447
01:12:06,293 --> 01:12:07,381
- Okay.
- Star.

1448
01:12:07,425 --> 01:12:08,861
Yeah?

1449
01:12:08,904 --> 01:12:10,210
I've never been this happy.

1450
01:12:10,558 --> 01:12:11,559
Really?

1451
01:12:12,342 --> 01:12:13,343
Oh.

1452
01:12:13,779 --> 01:12:15,345
- Musical.
- What?

1453
01:12:15,737 --> 01:12:20,438
Uh-uh. I've gonna be...

1454
01:12:20,481 --> 01:12:22,048
- I didn't get it.

1455
01:12:22,091 --> 01:12:24,050
I'm gonna be... Yeah.

1456
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:27,575
Okay.

1457
01:12:28,228 --> 01:12:29,403
Hmm?

1458
01:12:42,982 --> 01:12:43,983
Star.

1459
01:12:46,115 --> 01:12:48,770
Well, I don't know
how much clearer I can be.

1460
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:53,732
I've changed my mind.

1461
01:12:53,775 --> 01:12:55,255
I see now, you've been using me.

1462
01:12:55,298 --> 01:12:57,562
Edgar, don't be silly.

1463
01:12:57,605 --> 01:12:58,998
We're almost at
the finish line.

1464
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:02,175
And you and I can be official.

1465
01:13:02,436 --> 01:13:03,698
Don't even try.

1466
01:13:03,742 --> 01:13:05,700
You know,
I've figured it all out.

1467
01:13:05,744 --> 01:13:07,702
You pretended to loved me.

1468
01:13:07,746 --> 01:13:09,269
You made me a bunch of promises

1469
01:13:09,312 --> 01:13:10,662
so that I would come down here

1470
01:13:10,705 --> 01:13:12,664
and place the receiver
on the stage,

1471
01:13:12,707 --> 01:13:14,622
in the middle
of the Seafood Jam party,

1472
01:13:14,666 --> 01:13:16,537
that will attract
thousands of deadly mosquitoes

1473
01:13:16,581 --> 01:13:18,539
that are gonna kill
thousands of people.

1474
01:13:18,583 --> 01:13:20,149
Excuse me.

1475
01:13:20,193 --> 01:13:23,718
Did you get that leaf and pearl
necklace down by the boardwalk?

1476
01:13:23,762 --> 01:13:27,330
Oh, yes.
I got it at Baleafy Ornate.

1477
01:13:27,374 --> 01:13:28,680
I'm sorry. What?

1478
01:13:28,723 --> 01:13:31,117
- Baleafy Ornate.
- What?

1479
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,554
And not that you care,
but I have met someone.

1480
01:13:33,598 --> 01:13:36,644
And unlike you, I know... I know
what real love feels like,

1481
01:13:36,688 --> 01:13:38,777
and it is not
how you've treated me.

1482
01:13:39,517 --> 01:13:42,998
- It feels amazing and special.
- Oh, Edgar,

1483
01:13:43,042 --> 01:13:45,348
I really hate to be the one
to tell you this.

1484
01:13:45,392 --> 01:13:46,915
You know, you... your girlfriend

1485
01:13:46,959 --> 01:13:49,309
and her little partner,
the ones with the fluffy hair

1486
01:13:49,352 --> 01:13:51,964
- and the culottes.
- How do you know about them?

1487
01:13:52,007 --> 01:13:55,576
Their spies, Edgar. They're not
who they say they are

1488
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:57,535
and they've been playing you
all along.

1489
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:00,581
- You're lying.
- I wish I was.

1490
01:14:00,625 --> 01:14:01,539
Luckily,

1491
01:14:01,887 --> 01:14:04,324
I have some inside sources
at their agency.

1492
01:14:04,367 --> 01:14:05,847
What agency?
Who do they work for?

1493
01:14:06,152 --> 01:14:10,504
- The H...P... V.

1494
01:14:11,723 --> 01:14:13,725
- Sounds familiar.
- Check your emails.

1495
01:14:13,768 --> 01:14:16,075
We've intercepted some
of the photos they've sent back

1496
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:17,685
to headquarters.
I think you'll find

1497
01:14:17,729 --> 01:14:19,644
there are some interesting ones.

1498
01:14:22,603 --> 01:14:25,127
It all looks very fun.

1499
01:14:25,171 --> 01:14:27,303
- Star, no.
- Oh,

1500
01:14:27,347 --> 01:14:28,522
I know, Edgar,

1501
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:31,743
this must hurt that she
lied to you about loving you.

1502
01:14:32,221 --> 01:14:33,614
And I don't blame you

1503
01:14:33,658 --> 01:14:35,529
about running into the arms
of another woman.

1504
01:14:35,573 --> 01:14:37,749
I hadn't been there for you,
and I'm so sorry.

1505
01:14:37,792 --> 01:14:41,796
Let's get away after this,
find a little place in Portugal

1506
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,842
where we can be official.

1507
01:14:43,885 --> 01:14:46,671
I got the necklace
at Baleafy Ornate.

1508
01:14:46,714 --> 01:14:49,238
- I cannot hear you. What?
- Baleafy Ornate.

1509
01:14:49,282 --> 01:14:50,239
It's called Baleafy Ornate!

1510
01:14:50,675 --> 01:14:52,502
It sells everything bay leaf!

1511
01:14:52,546 --> 01:14:55,375
It's a play on words!
My God, lady!

1512
01:14:55,418 --> 01:14:56,419
Okay.

1513
01:14:58,421 --> 01:14:59,727
- Oh.

1514
01:15:02,817 --> 01:15:03,992
Sorry I yelled.

1515
01:15:04,514 --> 01:15:05,385
- Sorry.
- Shit!

1516
01:15:05,864 --> 01:15:06,952
What shit?

1517
01:15:07,256 --> 01:15:09,084
It was Barb, the other one.
She was listening

1518
01:15:09,128 --> 01:15:10,825
at the door.
Damn, they're good...

1519
01:15:10,869 --> 01:15:13,001
spies.
I can't believe this.

1520
01:15:13,523 --> 01:15:16,701
Edgar, you listen to me
and you listen to me good.

1521
01:15:25,492 --> 01:15:27,363
- Edgar?
- I'm listening.

1522
01:15:27,407 --> 01:15:29,322
Okay. I just wanted to make
sure you could still hear me.

1523
01:15:29,365 --> 01:15:31,193
Sometimes
the connection in here...

1524
01:15:31,237 --> 01:15:32,151
Anyway,

1525
01:15:32,542 --> 01:15:36,068
I need you to find those two.
And kill them.

1526
01:15:39,506 --> 01:15:40,507
Star.

1527
01:15:41,856 --> 01:15:42,857
Star!

1528
01:15:46,034 --> 01:15:48,210
Oh, don't bother
pretending to be sick anymore.

1529
01:15:48,254 --> 01:15:50,038
I know all
about your little lies.

1530
01:15:50,082 --> 01:15:52,127
And I know all
about you and Edgar.

1531
01:15:52,171 --> 01:15:54,216
And guess what?
He's a bad man!

1532
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:55,565
And he's gonna do
something terrible!

1533
01:15:55,957 --> 01:15:57,176
- What?
- He's following orders

1534
01:15:57,611 --> 01:15:58,917
from someone. I overheard him
on the phone with his boss.

1535
01:15:58,960 --> 01:15:59,918
His boss from Clamco?

1536
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:02,442
No, Star! He lied to you!
He's a killer!

1537
01:16:02,485 --> 01:16:03,530
A killer?

1538
01:16:04,313 --> 01:16:07,752
But, Barb, what you're saying
is ridiculous.

1539
01:16:07,795 --> 01:16:09,623
There's nothing ridiculous
about what I'm saying.

1540
01:16:09,667 --> 01:16:11,538
Edgar put a receiver
in the middle of the Seafood Jam

1541
01:16:11,581 --> 01:16:13,714
that'll trigger deadly mosquitos
that'll fly into the crowd

1542
01:16:13,758 --> 01:16:15,716
and sting everybody
with their killer tails!

1543
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:19,024
Why are you doing this?

1544
01:16:20,982 --> 01:16:23,289
- You're making this all up!
- Oh, come on.

1545
01:16:23,332 --> 01:16:24,464
I cannot believe you.

1546
01:16:24,507 --> 01:16:27,249
You're mad
because Edgar picked me!

1547
01:16:27,293 --> 01:16:29,382
Get me a break.
I am not mad about that.

1548
01:16:29,425 --> 01:16:31,253
And I am not making it up.

1549
01:16:31,906 --> 01:16:34,039
- I'm calling the police.
- Fine.

1550
01:16:36,084 --> 01:16:37,825
Jeff's Banana Boats?

1551
01:16:38,739 --> 01:16:39,914
I didn't go through with it.

1552
01:16:39,958 --> 01:16:41,786
While I was lying here
in my deathbed?

1553
01:16:41,829 --> 01:16:43,439
- You weren't sick.
- You didn't know that?

1554
01:16:43,483 --> 01:16:45,572
- Because you lied.
- So did you.

1555
01:16:49,445 --> 01:16:51,056
I should have gone
on that banana boat.

1556
01:16:51,099 --> 01:16:52,666
- I wish I did.
- Oh.

1557
01:16:52,710 --> 01:16:55,800
I hear it's a real
tit flapper.

1558
01:16:59,368 --> 01:17:01,022
911, what's your emergency?

1559
01:17:01,066 --> 01:17:02,415
Uh, never mind.

1560
01:17:02,458 --> 01:17:06,985
I thought I saw a burglar
but it was a... turtle.

1561
01:17:19,824 --> 01:17:21,477
Yoyo, where are you?

1562
01:17:21,521 --> 01:17:23,088
The mosquitoes are almost there.

1563
01:17:23,523 --> 01:17:24,437
Goodie.

1564
01:17:25,133 --> 01:17:27,919
And, remember, don't keep
the steering wheel too straight.

1565
01:17:27,962 --> 01:17:30,356
Lots of tiny movements,
left to right.

1566
01:17:33,054 --> 01:17:35,187
I wish we wouldn't
have had these ropes.

1567
01:17:35,230 --> 01:17:36,884
- Stop squirming.

1568
01:17:37,450 --> 01:17:39,931
Believe me this is better.
I'm supposed to kill you guys.

1569
01:17:39,974 --> 01:17:42,760
What? Who said to kill us?
Edgar, what is happening?

1570
01:17:42,803 --> 01:17:45,458
- Ow! Our bracelets are sharp.
- These bracelets really hurt.

1571
01:17:45,501 --> 01:17:47,503
- They're sharp. I know.
- They're sharp, be careful

1572
01:17:47,547 --> 01:17:49,767
with that. And we...

1573
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:52,378
Edgar, you lied to me!

1574
01:17:52,421 --> 01:17:55,468
You should talk.
I know all about the HPV.

1575
01:17:56,861 --> 01:17:58,645
Okay. Look, I was gonna
tell you about that.

1576
01:17:58,688 --> 01:18:01,126
A lot of people have it.
I mean, you probably have it.

1577
01:18:01,169 --> 01:18:03,432
What?
Stop trying to confuse me.

1578
01:18:04,129 --> 01:18:06,566
Star, I thought
you we're different.

1579
01:18:06,609 --> 01:18:07,828
Edgar.

1580
01:18:07,872 --> 01:18:09,395
Don't let him
bamboozled you, Star.

1581
01:18:09,438 --> 01:18:11,049
He's a murderer.
Tell her.

1582
01:18:11,092 --> 01:18:13,834
- You're not who you say you are.
- You're not who you say you are.

1583
01:18:13,878 --> 01:18:16,445
We are who we are.
We're Barb and Star.

1584
01:18:16,489 --> 01:18:19,579
Unlike you, Edgar,
you big effin' liar.

1585
01:18:19,622 --> 01:18:20,623
Huh?

1586
01:18:20,667 --> 01:18:22,495
God, I knew this wasn't real.

1587
01:18:22,538 --> 01:18:24,497
And no one could ever
love me again.

1588
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:26,673
God, I'm in so much grief
right now.

1589
01:18:26,716 --> 01:18:29,371
- Goodbye, ladies.
- Edgar, please wait.

1590
01:18:29,415 --> 01:18:31,069
A lot of innocent people
will die.

1591
01:18:31,112 --> 01:18:32,853
At least tell us why?

1592
01:18:32,897 --> 01:18:35,551
Why you would ever be involved
with such an awful thing?

1593
01:18:38,859 --> 01:18:42,254
Fine.
I'll tell you.

1594
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:48,042
- Oh, he pulled up a chair.
- It's gonna be a long story.

1595
01:18:48,086 --> 01:18:50,218
When I was seven years old
my father

1596
01:18:50,262 --> 01:18:51,959
left my mom,
my eleven sisters, and me.

1597
01:18:52,003 --> 01:18:54,396
- Use your bracelet.
- I was the oldest,

1598
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:55,920
so I had to support us.

1599
01:18:56,921 --> 01:18:58,313
We had no money.

1600
01:18:59,619 --> 01:19:02,448
I did odd jobs.
I built lawnmowers for Honda.

1601
01:19:02,491 --> 01:19:04,319
I even tried to sell my poop
to farmers

1602
01:19:04,363 --> 01:19:06,104
saying that it was fertilizer.

1603
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:08,671
It was never enough.

1604
01:19:09,281 --> 01:19:11,718
One day,
a woman wearing a cape

1605
01:19:11,761 --> 01:19:14,852
and bag over her head
put $50 in my cup.

1606
01:19:16,592 --> 01:19:18,507
- Oh. Hmm.
- Oh. Mm-hmm.

1607
01:19:20,770 --> 01:19:21,946
She started to seduce me

1608
01:19:21,989 --> 01:19:23,556
as the errands
became more criminal.

1609
01:19:23,599 --> 01:19:25,558
- I fell under her spell.

1610
01:19:26,211 --> 01:19:27,560
I thought it was love.

1611
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:32,043
I would do anything for her.

1612
01:19:32,086 --> 01:19:34,349
We'd always talk
about this particular plan.

1613
01:19:34,393 --> 01:19:35,524
Her life's work.

1614
01:19:36,395 --> 01:19:37,918
When it came time to help her,
I said, Yes.

1615
01:19:38,266 --> 01:19:39,877
Of course,
I had my reservations,

1616
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:40,921
but...

1617
01:19:41,966 --> 01:19:45,491
But she said when it was over,
we could be an official couple.

1618
01:19:45,534 --> 01:19:48,581
That's all I wanted at the time.
That's all I've ever wanted.

1619
01:19:49,799 --> 01:19:51,410
People do crazy things for love.

1620
01:19:52,498 --> 01:19:54,630
Yeah, but, I mean,
killing people, that's...

1621
01:19:54,674 --> 01:19:55,893
that's a lot.

1622
01:19:56,328 --> 01:19:58,939
Yeah, it's a lot of people.
That's... that's a little crazy.

1623
01:19:58,983 --> 01:20:01,420
Is it? Wouldn't you
have done it for Carmine?

1624
01:20:03,422 --> 01:20:04,727
And you for Ron?

1625
01:20:07,121 --> 01:20:08,688
Wait.

1626
01:20:08,731 --> 01:20:10,951
How do you know about Barb's
dead husband, Ron Quicksilver?

1627
01:20:10,995 --> 01:20:12,692
- Wait.
- She told me

1628
01:20:12,735 --> 01:20:14,172
- when she came to see me.
- Oh.

1629
01:20:14,215 --> 01:20:16,000
That night on the foot bridge
right before you did.

1630
01:20:16,043 --> 01:20:18,176
Well, you weren't supposed
to say that.

1631
01:20:18,698 --> 01:20:21,701
Goodbye, Barb and Star.
Whoever you are.

1632
01:20:25,139 --> 01:20:28,186
Okay. We can talk about it.
Let's just talk about it.

1633
01:20:28,229 --> 01:20:30,536
It's... It was a long time ago.
A long time.

1634
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:33,234
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome

1635
01:20:33,278 --> 01:20:36,020
to the 49th Annual Seafood Jam,

1636
01:20:36,716 --> 01:20:38,370
where the clams are hot

1637
01:20:38,413 --> 01:20:40,981
and the crowd
is on the older side.

1638
01:20:44,202 --> 01:20:45,507
People are gonna die!

1639
01:20:45,551 --> 01:20:47,161
- We have to find Edgar!
- You're right,

1640
01:20:47,205 --> 01:20:49,468
but by me agreeing with you
about having to stop Edgar,

1641
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:51,339
I don't agree about
stopping being mad at you.

1642
01:20:51,383 --> 01:20:53,298
We agree to go.
But I want you to know

1643
01:20:53,341 --> 01:20:54,995
that I'm frustrated and hurt

1644
01:20:55,039 --> 01:20:56,649
and I'm really
freaking pissed off.

1645
01:20:56,692 --> 01:20:58,956
I'm freaking pissed off too.
It's not that I'm copying you

1646
01:20:58,999 --> 01:21:00,087
- It's because I am.
- Fine.

1647
01:21:04,570 --> 01:21:05,788
Hello.

1648
01:21:05,832 --> 01:21:06,876
Hi.

1649
01:21:24,894 --> 01:21:27,027
- Oh, hello.

1650
01:21:27,506 --> 01:21:29,421
Enjoying your vacation?

1651
01:21:30,596 --> 01:21:32,032
- Well, um...
- Oh, um...

1652
01:21:32,076 --> 01:21:34,426
- It started out fine.
- ...supposed to be a friend trip

1653
01:21:34,469 --> 01:21:36,080
- We got here and we were...
- And we got here.

1654
01:21:36,123 --> 01:21:37,646
- No, I didn't...

1655
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:40,040
The first night, we went out
to loosen up a little bit.

1656
01:21:40,084 --> 01:21:42,695
That's when we meet Edgar,
which was not a good idea.

1657
01:21:42,738 --> 01:21:45,176
Edgar and I started hanging out,
and I was lying to Barb,

1658
01:21:45,219 --> 01:21:47,134
- which I shouldn't have done...
- I met Tommy Bahama.

1659
01:21:47,178 --> 01:21:49,093
- You met Tommy Bahama? Anyway...
- Then we discovered...

1660
01:21:49,136 --> 01:21:50,181
Enough!

1661
01:21:50,616 --> 01:21:54,402
I have set up one last excursion
for the two of you.

1662
01:21:54,446 --> 01:21:56,752
It's more of a game, really.

1663
01:21:56,796 --> 01:22:02,106
The rules are
you get to choose how you die.

1664
01:22:02,149 --> 01:22:03,281
- What?
- What?

1665
01:22:03,716 --> 01:22:05,500
You can either
jump off that cliff behind you

1666
01:22:05,544 --> 01:22:07,807
hitting every sharp rock
on the way down,

1667
01:22:07,850 --> 01:22:09,635
ripping your skin
at every bounce

1668
01:22:09,678 --> 01:22:12,681
or you can stay here
and have dinner

1669
01:22:13,552 --> 01:22:16,946
with, um... my new friends.

1670
01:22:16,990 --> 01:22:18,470
- There are two

1671
01:22:18,774 --> 01:22:22,430
very hungry hot alligators
in those crates.

1672
01:22:22,474 --> 01:22:23,692
Alligators?

1673
01:22:23,736 --> 01:22:25,259
- Oh, please. No, no...
- No, no, no...

1674
01:22:25,303 --> 01:22:28,741
That's what you get
for getting in my way.

1675
01:22:29,785 --> 01:22:34,225
Now, you can kiss your
middle-aged, flat, wide asses...

1676
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:38,794
...goodbye.

1677
01:22:38,838 --> 01:22:39,969
- Please wait!
- Oh, my gosh!

1678
01:22:40,231 --> 01:22:42,146
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1679
01:22:44,844 --> 01:22:47,064
Thanks a lot, Star, for making
me come on this trip.

1680
01:22:47,107 --> 01:22:48,804
Now, we're gonna die
just like I predicted.

1681
01:22:48,848 --> 01:22:50,806
Oh, will you just stop
your complaining for once?

1682
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:52,156
Seems to me like you've been
having the time

1683
01:22:52,199 --> 01:22:54,027
- of your life here.
- Oh, I sure have.

1684
01:23:08,694 --> 01:23:10,826
When we get to heaven, we're not
living with each other,

1685
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:12,611
and we're not running around
playing harps

1686
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:13,612
in our halos and wings!

1687
01:23:14,265 --> 01:23:16,571
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm not even
gonna look for you up there!

1688
01:23:16,615 --> 01:23:18,617
I'm gonna find the farthest
cloud away from you.

1689
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,314
And I'm gonna find Betsy Ross!

1690
01:23:20,358 --> 01:23:22,229
And I'm gonna be
best friends with her.

1691
01:23:22,273 --> 01:23:24,449
And we're gonna ignore you
at all the parties.

1692
01:23:29,236 --> 01:23:31,238
I guess we're gonna die
on bad terms.

1693
01:23:31,282 --> 01:23:32,587
I guess you're right.

1694
01:23:52,477 --> 01:23:54,653
- Our culottes!
- They're natural parachutes.

1695
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:13,367
I'm so sorry. Oh!

1696
01:24:13,411 --> 01:24:15,326
So sorry. Lying to you
was the hardest thing

1697
01:24:15,369 --> 01:24:16,544
I've ever had to do.

1698
01:24:16,588 --> 01:24:18,329
- I'm sorry too.
- No. This is all my fault.

1699
01:24:18,372 --> 01:24:20,026
None of this will be happening
if I hadn't suggested

1700
01:24:20,069 --> 01:24:21,680
coming on this trip
in the first place.

1701
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:24,073
Are you kidding? I've had
the time of my life here.

1702
01:24:24,117 --> 01:24:25,814
I've done things
I never thought I would do.

1703
01:24:25,858 --> 01:24:27,816
- I went in the ocean, Star.

1704
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:30,036
- And I got my labia pierced.
- What?

1705
01:24:30,079 --> 01:24:32,212
I took it out.
Immediately took it out.

1706
01:24:32,256 --> 01:24:34,301
I should never have spent
all that time with Edgar

1707
01:24:34,345 --> 01:24:36,173
behind your back.
I should've told you.

1708
01:24:36,216 --> 01:24:38,697
I know you're only
trying to protect my feelings.

1709
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,394
And I'm so happy you found love.

1710
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:45,573
I mean, it's unfortunate that
he turned out to be a conman

1711
01:24:45,617 --> 01:24:48,228
- and a mass murderer.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1712
01:24:49,447 --> 01:24:50,535
- Oh, my God.
- Edgar.

1713
01:24:50,578 --> 01:24:52,276
- We have to stop him.
- Go!

1714
01:24:53,407 --> 01:24:56,323
The Seafood Jam
just keeps on jamming!

1715
01:24:56,932 --> 01:24:58,151
Nice view.

1716
01:25:00,936 --> 01:25:02,460
- What are you doing here?

1717
01:25:03,591 --> 01:25:05,114
Cleaning up your mess.

1718
01:25:05,158 --> 01:25:06,681
Seems like
you can't follow through

1719
01:25:06,725 --> 01:25:08,727
with anything these days.
For example,

1720
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:10,816
getting rid
of your little friends.

1721
01:25:12,426 --> 01:25:15,603
- I did. I-I mean, I...
- Oh, it's okay, Edgar.

1722
01:25:15,647 --> 01:25:18,215
I took care of them myself.

1723
01:25:18,258 --> 01:25:19,128
What?

1724
01:25:19,738 --> 01:25:21,696
- What did you do?
- Let's just say

1725
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:24,046
there are a couple
of alligators out there

1726
01:25:24,090 --> 01:25:27,398
with bellies full of... them.

1727
01:25:28,399 --> 01:25:31,445
Oh, don't be so sad, Edgar.

1728
01:25:31,489 --> 01:25:34,666
Those two were just a couple
of pathetic Stellas

1729
01:25:34,709 --> 01:25:36,494
trying to get their groove back.

1730
01:25:37,103 --> 01:25:38,539
But they were spies, right?

1731
01:25:39,497 --> 01:25:42,064
I mean, you told me
that they were spies.

1732
01:25:42,108 --> 01:25:44,632
Sorry. I just said that
to get what I want.

1733
01:25:45,285 --> 01:25:46,765
Sometimes I do that,

1734
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:50,334
but I'll work on it
on our relationship, I promise.

1735
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:53,293
That is still what you want,
isn't it, Edgar?

1736
01:25:53,859 --> 01:25:54,903
To be official?

1737
01:25:56,427 --> 01:26:00,039
And, um, the receiver
is in position?

1738
01:26:00,082 --> 01:26:01,867
It's on the stage.

1739
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:04,043
- The microchip is inside.
- Good.

1740
01:26:10,005 --> 01:26:11,137
This is it.

1741
01:26:11,790 --> 01:26:13,357
My moment of glory.

1742
01:26:14,967 --> 01:26:19,711
Goodbye, Vista Del Mar.
You stupid place

1743
01:26:19,754 --> 01:26:21,103
full of dummies.

1744
01:26:28,763 --> 01:26:30,548
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1745
01:26:31,244 --> 01:26:32,550
Shit.

1746
01:26:41,210 --> 01:26:42,690
- Shit.
- Of course, shrimp

1747
01:26:42,734 --> 01:26:45,389
is the most popular fish
in America.

1748
01:26:45,432 --> 01:26:46,955
Let's introduce our finalists.

1749
01:26:47,826 --> 01:26:48,914
Star?

1750
01:26:48,957 --> 01:26:50,394
- Sorry.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

1751
01:26:50,437 --> 01:26:52,265
Oh, my God.
Where?

1752
01:26:52,309 --> 01:26:54,136
He said it was on the stage.

1753
01:26:57,401 --> 01:26:59,228
- Star.
- Yes?

1754
01:26:59,272 --> 01:27:00,882
Oh, my gosh. That's it.

1755
01:27:01,579 --> 01:27:03,581
Star, it's bleeping.

1756
01:27:03,624 --> 01:27:04,886
Go, go, go, go.

1757
01:27:08,673 --> 01:27:10,588
- We need to get it in the water!
- Okay!

1758
01:27:10,631 --> 01:27:12,198
Run, run!
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.

1759
01:27:12,241 --> 01:27:13,547
- Look, look, look.
- Yeah?

1760
01:27:13,591 --> 01:27:16,028
- Oh, Lord, shells?
- Everything's shells.

1761
01:27:16,071 --> 01:27:18,160
What kind of bird is this?
It's all made out of shells.

1762
01:27:18,204 --> 01:27:20,598
- Star!
- He's coming. Run!

1763
01:27:20,641 --> 01:27:21,860
Star. Guys, please stop!

1764
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:23,644
Please wait!
Hey, I'm trying to stop this!

1765
01:27:23,688 --> 01:27:25,342
No! We won't let you do this.

1766
01:27:25,385 --> 01:27:27,256
We'll throw it on the ocean
and destroy it.

1767
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:28,475
No. That won't destroy it.

1768
01:27:28,519 --> 01:27:29,955
- Just... just give it to me.
- No.

1769
01:27:29,998 --> 01:27:31,043
Look, I'm sorry.

1770
01:27:31,565 --> 01:27:33,828
She told me you were spies.
That's why I tied you up.

1771
01:27:33,872 --> 01:27:36,875
She's manipulated me
this whole time.

1772
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:38,703
- Why should we believe you?
- Because...

1773
01:27:40,792 --> 01:27:42,837
- I love you, Star.

1774
01:27:43,534 --> 01:27:44,665
Oh.

1775
01:27:45,057 --> 01:27:47,581
I think you're the most
beautiful woman I've ever met,

1776
01:27:48,669 --> 01:27:50,279
especially on the inside.

1777
01:27:51,150 --> 01:27:54,109
Edgar, please.
Not in front of Barb.

1778
01:27:54,153 --> 01:27:56,895
- No. Not that inside.
- Oh.

1779
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:58,853
- Your heart.
- Oh.

1780
01:27:58,897 --> 01:28:01,073
Listen, I need you guys
to get in the cab

1781
01:28:01,116 --> 01:28:03,118
and drive inland
as fast as you can, okay?

1782
01:28:03,162 --> 01:28:05,120
I'm gonna get in the boat
and dump the receiver

1783
01:28:05,164 --> 01:28:06,470
far out in the ocean, okay?

1784
01:28:06,513 --> 01:28:07,775
You don't have
to worry about me.

1785
01:28:07,819 --> 01:28:09,777
Look, I have the antidote.

1786
01:28:14,478 --> 01:28:15,348
What's the matter?

1787
01:28:16,349 --> 01:28:17,611
Lemon infused ice tea?

1788
01:28:18,917 --> 01:28:21,398
She was setting me up
to die this whole time.

1789
01:28:21,441 --> 01:28:23,748
- Oh. That's not nice.
- Oh. Oh, no.

1790
01:28:24,357 --> 01:28:25,358
It doesn't matter.

1791
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:28,361
The plan is the same.
I have to go through with it.

1792
01:28:28,405 --> 01:28:30,102
I got us into this mess.
I'm gonna fix it.

1793
01:28:30,145 --> 01:28:31,625
- No, Edgar. No, you can't.
- Star...

1794
01:28:33,366 --> 01:28:34,759
I'm sorry
for getting you into this.

1795
01:28:36,151 --> 01:28:37,544
- Goodbye, Star.
- No.

1796
01:28:37,588 --> 01:28:39,459
- You mean hello...

1797
01:28:39,503 --> 01:28:40,547
...to me.

1798
01:28:41,069 --> 01:28:41,983
It's me, fools,

1799
01:28:42,506 --> 01:28:45,987
Darlie Bunkle.
Now, do you recognize me?

1800
01:28:46,031 --> 01:28:47,902
- I was wearing disguise glasses.

1801
01:28:48,381 --> 01:28:49,600
And this disguise shirt,

1802
01:28:49,643 --> 01:28:50,949
- and this disguise...
- Run!

1803
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:53,038
- Whoa! Hey!

1804
01:28:57,390 --> 01:29:00,045
Hey. Sir. Sir, can we please
borrow your Jet Ski?

1805
01:29:00,088 --> 01:29:01,133
It's really important.

1806
01:29:01,438 --> 01:29:03,004
Don't explain.
I need no further information.

1807
01:29:03,048 --> 01:29:05,703
- Take it. We trust you. Come on.
- I'll drive. Come on.

1808
01:29:05,746 --> 01:29:06,747
Okay.

1809
01:29:07,792 --> 01:29:09,620
Uh, it's beeping faster.

1810
01:29:12,927 --> 01:29:15,147
Okie-dokey.
Time to surface.

1811
01:29:22,110 --> 01:29:23,677
- We're sorry,

1812
01:29:23,721 --> 01:29:26,375
you have reached a number
that's no longer in service.

1813
01:29:53,228 --> 01:29:55,448
Ladies and gentlemen...

1814
01:29:57,015 --> 01:29:59,887
...who will be
this year's

1815
01:29:59,931 --> 01:30:04,892
Seafood Jam Shrimp Queen?

1816
01:30:25,652 --> 01:30:27,045
Releasing the mosquitoes.

1817
01:30:37,403 --> 01:30:39,797
- What's happening?

1818
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,407
We're gonna die this time!

1819
01:30:45,542 --> 01:30:47,413
Okay. My turn.

1820
01:30:48,370 --> 01:30:50,677
My favorite facial expression
goes like this.

1821
01:30:59,425 --> 01:31:01,470
Lord, we're coming
to see you now!

1822
01:31:01,514 --> 01:31:03,821
- Open the gate!
- The pearly one!

1823
01:31:03,864 --> 01:31:05,605
Make sure
it's the pearly one!

1824
01:31:06,214 --> 01:31:07,694
And the winner is...

1825
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:09,478
Sydney Hobart!

1826
01:31:10,305 --> 01:31:13,308
# She is the Shrimp Queen #

1827
01:31:13,352 --> 01:31:17,574
# Is she a dream
Or is she real? #

1828
01:31:18,357 --> 01:31:22,143
# What a glorious deal
For her and the... #

1829
01:31:22,666 --> 01:31:25,799
- Just stop!

1830
01:31:25,843 --> 01:31:27,105
Fine.

1831
01:31:28,672 --> 01:31:31,457
I'll give you your break.
You need it.

1832
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:34,895
Star. What have I done?
I should be right there.

1833
01:31:38,856 --> 01:31:40,422
Barb,
I gotta get something

1834
01:31:40,466 --> 01:31:42,337
really big off my chest.
The biggest lie of them all.

1835
01:31:42,381 --> 01:31:43,991
- I gotta tell you.
- What?

1836
01:31:44,644 --> 01:31:46,254
I never went
to a turtle's house.

1837
01:31:46,298 --> 01:31:48,213
Oh, Star, that's okay.

1838
01:31:48,256 --> 01:31:50,911
I never splashed and played
with a baby turtle in the tub.

1839
01:31:50,955 --> 01:31:52,870
I never even got in the tub.

1840
01:31:52,913 --> 01:31:54,523
And I still have my
labia pierced.

1841
01:31:54,567 --> 01:31:56,003
- What?
- God, it's so uncomfortable

1842
01:31:56,047 --> 01:31:58,440
sitting on this thing.
I don't think it's healed yet.

1843
01:31:58,484 --> 01:31:59,616
- Barb?

1844
01:32:01,226 --> 01:32:03,097
- Barb!

1845
01:32:08,973 --> 01:32:11,105
- Give it to me!
- It's too late. It's over.

1846
01:32:17,503 --> 01:32:19,592
Give it to me, or she drowns!

1847
01:32:19,636 --> 01:32:22,639
Star, no!
Star, no!

1848
01:32:25,859 --> 01:32:26,860
Really?

1849
01:32:32,039 --> 01:32:33,258
Eureka!

1850
01:32:35,782 --> 01:32:37,697
Ha!

1851
01:32:41,658 --> 01:32:42,833
Looking for this?

1852
01:32:43,703 --> 01:32:45,183
Yes, I was actually.

1853
01:32:46,488 --> 01:32:48,360
You're really gonna sacrifice
your own lives

1854
01:32:48,403 --> 01:32:50,144
for those fools on the beach?

1855
01:32:50,971 --> 01:32:52,320
Give me the keys!

1856
01:32:53,365 --> 01:32:54,975
- Barb?
- Star?

1857
01:32:55,759 --> 01:32:57,108
No, no, no, no.

1858
01:33:02,548 --> 01:33:06,030
No! No!

1859
01:34:17,188 --> 01:34:18,667
Sorry about that, man.

1860
01:34:19,756 --> 01:34:22,019
Let me know if you wanna get
some food later.

1861
01:34:28,286 --> 01:34:29,809
Barb and Star,

1862
01:34:29,853 --> 01:34:32,856
they... they saved us all.
Now they're gone.

1863
01:34:52,789 --> 01:34:55,748
# Did you ever-eever-eyever
In your life-lee-low #

1864
01:34:56,096 --> 01:34:59,186
# See a diver-deever-devver
Kiss his wife-wee-woe... #

1865
01:34:59,230 --> 01:35:00,797
What the fuck?

1866
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:02,363
# In the kingdom of the sea

1867
01:35:02,407 --> 01:35:05,366
# While the bubbles bounce
About above the water? #

1868
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:09,631
You're alive?

1869
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:15,289
What just happened?
What was that?

1870
01:35:19,424 --> 01:35:20,817
It was Trish.

1871
01:35:29,521 --> 01:35:31,392
Oh, Star, I'm so sorry

1872
01:35:31,436 --> 01:35:34,004
I was ever involved in such
a horrible plan. I mean,

1873
01:35:34,918 --> 01:35:36,223
I'm so ashamed.

1874
01:35:36,267 --> 01:35:38,660
No, Edgar, I believe you.

1875
01:35:39,574 --> 01:35:42,403
And I do wanna be
an official couple with you.

1876
01:35:43,578 --> 01:35:45,102
Because I love you.

1877
01:35:45,624 --> 01:35:47,844
I love you with all
my fart... heart.

1878
01:35:47,887 --> 01:35:50,281
Oh, God. What a terrible time
to flub my words.

1879
01:35:51,456 --> 01:35:52,631
- Whoo.
- Yeah.

1880
01:35:52,674 --> 01:35:53,762
- All right.
- Wow!

1881
01:35:53,806 --> 01:35:55,503
- I just wanna say,

1882
01:35:56,156 --> 01:35:59,333
I believe you too, Edgar,
so we're cool.

1883
01:35:59,856 --> 01:36:01,248
Everything's cool.

1884
01:36:01,901 --> 01:36:03,903
I do wonder where we're all
gonna live though?

1885
01:36:03,947 --> 01:36:05,644
Well, isn't this sweet?

1886
01:36:09,256 --> 01:36:11,215
Surprised to see me?

1887
01:36:11,258 --> 01:36:14,087
Well, I'm not surprise.
You took the real antidote?

1888
01:36:14,131 --> 01:36:16,785
Of course, I did!
You traitor!

1889
01:36:16,829 --> 01:36:19,440
And as for you,
I should've push you two

1890
01:36:19,484 --> 01:36:21,312
off the cliff
when I had the chance!

1891
01:36:22,052 --> 01:36:23,967
But it's not too late for me

1892
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:26,273
to shut your blabbing trap.

1893
01:36:26,317 --> 01:36:28,667
No. You shut your
blabbing trap.

1894
01:36:28,710 --> 01:36:29,755
You're a nobody.

1895
01:36:31,191 --> 01:36:32,889
- Not anymore!

1896
01:36:33,977 --> 01:36:37,502
I am Barb freakin' Quicksilver,
and I have been delivered.

1897
01:36:37,545 --> 01:36:39,199
- I used to be afraid

1898
01:36:39,243 --> 01:36:41,201
of a lot of stuff,
including people like you.

1899
01:36:41,245 --> 01:36:42,507
But I'm not afraid anymore!

1900
01:36:42,942 --> 01:36:44,901
And I know my truth.
I'm a phoenix.

1901
01:36:44,944 --> 01:36:47,033
- Now, my friend,

1902
01:36:47,077 --> 01:36:49,557
Star is really good with words,
and she is gonna speak now!

1903
01:36:49,601 --> 01:36:50,776
You won't be rude through it.

1904
01:36:50,819 --> 01:36:52,299
You won't be rude,
you rude lady!

1905
01:36:53,126 --> 01:36:55,215
- Ha-hoya!

1906
01:36:55,824 --> 01:36:58,349
Star, the beach is yours.

1907
01:37:00,177 --> 01:37:01,700
You can do this, Star.

1908
01:37:06,444 --> 01:37:07,445
Hi.

1909
01:37:08,185 --> 01:37:09,926
I know you have a lot of pain.

1910
01:37:10,839 --> 01:37:13,364
You're just trying to hurt
all these people because...

1911
01:37:14,147 --> 01:37:15,932
you're hurting inside yourself.

1912
01:37:16,976 --> 01:37:18,630
But you're not alone.

1913
01:37:19,544 --> 01:37:21,633
I've always been alone.

1914
01:37:22,416 --> 01:37:25,202
Well, that's terrible.
No friends?

1915
01:37:26,029 --> 01:37:27,334
I hate that word.

1916
01:37:28,466 --> 01:37:30,511
Friend is the best word of all.

1917
01:37:30,555 --> 01:37:32,949
I mean, they're there
when you're sad.

1918
01:37:32,992 --> 01:37:35,821
They jump up and down with you
when something good happens.

1919
01:37:35,864 --> 01:37:37,823
Yeah. And you'll spend
your birthdays together

1920
01:37:37,866 --> 01:37:40,521
and stay up late giggling
about boobs and butts and stuff.

1921
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:44,961
No one ever wants to be...
my friend.

1922
01:37:48,051 --> 01:37:49,443
I'll be your friend.

1923
01:37:49,487 --> 01:37:50,488
What?

1924
01:37:52,055 --> 01:37:53,056
So will I.

1925
01:37:54,405 --> 01:37:56,059
Me too.
I'll be your friend.

1926
01:37:56,102 --> 01:37:58,409
- Me too.
- Me too.

1927
01:37:58,713 --> 01:38:00,237
I'd very much like
being your friend,

1928
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:01,586
if you'll take me.

1929
01:38:05,546 --> 01:38:06,504
Edgar?

1930
01:38:07,331 --> 01:38:12,379
Uh... I mean, it's kind of weird
but I guess.

1931
01:38:12,423 --> 01:38:14,207
After everything I've done?

1932
01:38:17,384 --> 01:38:18,603
I'm not going to...

1933
01:38:19,386 --> 01:38:21,040
I'm not gonna get emotional.

1934
01:38:21,084 --> 01:38:22,694
No. No!

1935
01:38:23,651 --> 01:38:26,002
I'm not going to cry. No.

1936
01:38:26,567 --> 01:38:29,135
They're trying to come up,
but no.

1937
01:38:29,179 --> 01:38:30,963
No! No!

1938
01:38:31,007 --> 01:38:33,400
They're coming.
My feelings are coming!

1939
01:38:36,099 --> 01:38:37,230
Yes!

1940
01:38:37,274 --> 01:38:40,320
I'm ready to have friends!

1941
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:44,063
And now I'm gonna
rush out into the crowd.

1942
01:38:44,107 --> 01:38:46,022
I mean, all of you,
we could giggle

1943
01:38:46,065 --> 01:38:48,589
about boobs and butts.
Who wants to be my first friend?

1944
01:38:49,025 --> 01:38:50,026
We did it.

1945
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:57,294
Barb, there something
on your chest.

1946
01:38:58,512 --> 01:39:00,819
- It's like you're glowing.
- So are you. On your chest.

1947
01:39:02,386 --> 01:39:03,430
What is...

1948
01:39:05,258 --> 01:39:06,912
It's our shimmer.

1949
01:39:15,051 --> 01:39:16,269
- Edgar.
- That's great.

1950
01:39:16,313 --> 01:39:18,315
- We got our shimmer. I saw hers.
- She saw mine.

1951
01:39:18,358 --> 01:39:19,664
What do you say
we go celebrate

1952
01:39:20,143 --> 01:39:21,187
if I get another
buried treasure.

1953
01:39:21,231 --> 01:39:23,276
- Ooh. That sounds fun.
- Yeah.

1954
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:25,670
- Really fun!
- But actually, um...

1955
01:39:25,713 --> 01:39:27,976
Barb and I have something
we have to do first.

1956
01:39:29,761 --> 01:39:31,632
- We found it.
- I can't believe it.

1957
01:39:31,676 --> 01:39:34,200
Well, looks like
Barb and Star

1958
01:39:34,244 --> 01:39:35,897
found some adventure after all.

1959
01:39:36,637 --> 01:39:38,552
I mean, ain't that
what we all want?

1960
01:39:39,205 --> 01:39:41,642
A little love, friendship,
and adventure?

1961
01:39:42,252 --> 01:39:44,863
Well, I hope you learned
something here today.

1962
01:39:44,906 --> 01:39:46,256
I know I did.

1963
01:39:46,299 --> 01:39:48,954
Sometimes you gotta step out
of your box a little

1964
01:39:48,997 --> 01:39:51,565
then you'll know what life
is really about.

1965
01:39:51,609 --> 01:39:53,524
But then again, what do I know?

1966
01:39:53,567 --> 01:39:57,049
I'm just a fun-loving
water spirit named Trish.

1967
01:39:57,702 --> 01:39:59,182
Bye-bye now.

1968
01:40:16,112 --> 01:40:17,591
# Ay

1969
01:40:30,648 --> 01:40:32,606
Hey, middle-aged people.

1970
01:40:32,650 --> 01:40:34,260
You thought this was over?

1971
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:37,394
You are wrong.

1972
01:40:39,918 --> 01:40:41,528
It's time to boogie!

1973
01:40:41,572 --> 01:40:43,530
# Okay, shawty
What's happenin'? #

1974
01:40:43,574 --> 01:40:45,489
# Girl let's get
This thing crackin' #

1975
01:40:45,532 --> 01:40:47,273
# You just bend it on over

1976
01:40:47,317 --> 01:40:49,275
# I'll get behind
And you make it wind #

1977
01:40:49,319 --> 01:40:51,321
# Jump in the line
Shake your body on mine #

1978
01:40:51,364 --> 01:40:52,887
# Ba-dong-bong-bong
Ba-dong-ba-da-bong-bong #

1979
01:40:52,931 --> 01:40:55,760
- We keep going? A little more.
- Yeah. Just a little more.

1980
01:40:56,848 --> 01:40:58,980
# Jump in the line
Shake your body on mine #

1981
01:40:59,024 --> 01:41:00,808
# Brra-dong
Ba-dong-ba-dong-bong #

1982
01:41:00,852 --> 01:41:02,767
# Jump in the line
Shake your body on mine #

1983
01:41:02,810 --> 01:41:04,812
# Ba-dong-bong-bong
Ba-dong-ba-da-bong-bong... #

1984
01:41:18,130 --> 01:41:19,697
# Shake, shake, shake, señora

1985
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:21,481
- # Shake it left and right
- # Right

1986
01:41:21,525 --> 01:41:24,963
# Work, work, work, señora
Right into my ride #

1987
01:41:25,006 --> 01:41:27,139
# Miami's in the house
Without a doubt #

1988
01:41:27,183 --> 01:41:29,097
# I'm the Chico, in the club
That they yell about #

1989
01:41:29,141 --> 01:41:31,404
# I'm from the city
Where the women all real... #

1990
01:41:31,448 --> 01:41:32,840
It's getting hard to breath
a little bit,

1991
01:41:32,884 --> 01:41:34,146
but I'm gonna keep going.

1992
01:41:34,712 --> 01:41:36,540
# And that ass
Is off the chain #

1993
01:41:36,583 --> 01:41:38,063
# I hit that thing so hard

1994
01:41:38,106 --> 01:41:40,108
# She called 411 pain
Dammit, man #

1995
01:41:40,674 --> 01:41:42,459
# Let's go to Jamaica
For Sean Paul #

1996
01:41:42,502 --> 01:41:44,243
# Then take it to tally
For T-Pain #

1997
01:41:44,287 --> 01:41:46,289
# Mami move that ass
Like chitty-chitty bang-bang #

1998
01:41:46,332 --> 01:41:47,986
# Chitty-chitty bang-bang

1999
01:41:48,029 --> 01:41:49,683
# Okay, shawty
What's happenin'? #

2000
01:41:49,727 --> 01:41:51,424
# Girl let's get
This thing crackin' #

2001
01:41:51,468 --> 01:41:53,252
# You just bend it on over

2002
01:41:53,296 --> 01:41:55,211
# I'll get behind
And you make it wind #

2003
01:41:55,254 --> 01:41:57,213
# Jump in the line
Shake your body on mine #

2004
01:41:57,256 --> 01:41:58,779
# Brra-dong
Ba-dong-ba-dong-bong #

2005
01:41:58,823 --> 01:42:00,781
# Jump in the line
Shake your body on mine #

2006
01:42:00,825 --> 01:42:02,609
# Brra-dong
Ba-dong-ba-dong-bong... #

2007
01:42:02,653 --> 01:42:04,568
I don't have any sand
in my mouth yet...

2008
01:42:04,611 --> 01:42:05,786
- You don't?
- Not yet.

2009
01:42:05,830 --> 01:42:07,310
I can feel a little
granules, like,

2010
01:42:07,353 --> 01:42:09,268
- in between my teeth, like...
- Your teeth? Oh!

2011
01:42:09,312 --> 01:42:11,009
- I just got some. There you go.
- Oh, there you go.

2012
01:42:11,052 --> 01:42:12,793
# Brra-dong
Ba-dong-ba-dong-bong #

2013
01:42:51,092 --> 01:42:54,008
Ah. Can we talk about
horses now?

2014
01:42:54,574 --> 01:42:55,662
Give it to me.

2015
01:44:18,049 --> 01:44:19,224
Woo-hoo.

2016
01:44:31,497 --> 01:44:32,759
My bad.

2017
01:46:34,315 --> 01:46:36,492
There are good ships.
And wood ships.

2018
01:46:36,535 --> 01:46:38,145
And ships that sail the sea.

2019
01:46:38,189 --> 01:46:40,104
But the best ships
are friendships.

2020
01:46:40,147 --> 01:46:41,975
And may they always be.

2021
01:46:43,368 --> 01:46:44,848
I agree.
