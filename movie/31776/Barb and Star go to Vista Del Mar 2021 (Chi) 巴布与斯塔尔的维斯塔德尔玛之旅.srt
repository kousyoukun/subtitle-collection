After years of work,
I have developed

genetically modified mosquitos

This remote here, activates
that receiver under the cow,

the mosquitos.

These are not just
itchy mosquito bites.

One sting will kill
a large animal within minutes.

49

in the middle of a small town,

50
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:13,097
the mosquitoes
would then fly towards it

in the town?

- Hypothetically.
- Well,

given that we have
thousands of mosquitos,

54

155
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,385
- Are we getting a juke box?
- Please tell me

156
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:29,620
we're getting that jukebox.

157
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,955
No, please stop asking me
about that.

158
00:09:32,523 --> 00:09:33,891
The store is closing for good.

159
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:36,126
Apparently,
Jennifer Convertibles

160
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,928
as a national chain

161
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:43,000
closed about seven months ago
and nobody bothered to tell us.

162
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:44,902
- So, what does that mean?
- What does that mean?

163
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:46,970
I'm sorry,
I know you love it here.

164
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,939
But the good news is that
the company

165
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:50,474
- is giving you severance.
- No. Severance?

166
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,443
- We don't wanna be severanced.
- No! Please!

167
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:54,645
This job is our lives.
It's our purpose.

168
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:56,347
Where are we
gonna host Thanksgiving?

169
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,548
Well, you can...

170
00:09:58,082 --> 00:10:01,518
Wait, you come in here
when the store is closed

171
00:10:01,552 --> 00:10:03,520
and host
your Thanksgiving dinners?

172
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:09,393
[both] No.

173
00:10:10,627 --> 00:10:12,329
[Star] God I'm really upset.

174
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:14,365
I can't believe we're not
gonna work here anymore.

175
00:10:14,398 --> 00:10:16,900
I'm grieving. I think...
I think I'm really grieving.

176
00:10:16,934 --> 00:10:18,369
Me too, but you know what?

177
00:10:18,402 --> 00:10:20,604
We'll find another job.
This small town's full of places

178
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:22,639
looking to hire women
in their 40s.

179
00:10:22,673 --> 00:10:24,975
Yeah. That's the attitude!

180
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:27,344
- We'll find something better.
- Yeah.

181
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:30,347
I mean, we both
have high school degrees.

182
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:32,015
- Well, you do.
- Well, I don't.

183
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:33,984
- I thought you did.
- Well, I don't.

184
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,622
- Well, what can we do?
- [woman] Ladies!

185
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:40,057
Hi!

186
00:10:40,457 --> 00:10:42,259
[both] Mickey.

187
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:45,195
[upbeat music playing]

188
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:48,966
- You look amazing.
- You look great.

189
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:50,467
- Wow.
- Miguel and I just got back

190
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:52,002
from vacation.

191
00:10:52,035 --> 00:10:54,471
My dermatologist
is not gonna be happy with me.

192
00:10:54,505 --> 00:10:57,708
I soaked up some mega rays.
[laughs]

193
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,010
Gosh, you can see it.
You look glowing.

194
00:11:00,043 --> 00:11:00,812
You look really dark.

195
00:11:01,044 --> 00:11:03,347
Girls, I might just pack up
and moved there.

196
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,149
- What? Where?
- [both] Where did you go?

197
00:11:05,482 --> 00:11:08,152
It's this tiny little oasis
on the coast of Florida.

198
00:11:08,185 --> 00:11:10,053
It's people like us.
Mid-lifers

199
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:13,157
who still like to strut past
the pool and stop the party

200
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:16,260
dead in its tracks with a tube
top and full jewelry.

201
00:11:16,293 --> 00:11:18,395
- Oh. Yeah.
- [Mickey] I'm not kidding.

202
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:20,063
I feel like I got a soul-douche.

203
00:11:20,364 --> 00:11:22,332
- A soul-douche? Well...
- [chuckling]

204
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:24,034
And not that I was looking,

205
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:26,570
but there are so many
gorgeous men there.

206
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,205
We're talking Tommy Bahama

207
00:11:28,238 --> 00:11:29,473
from head to toe.

208
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:31,575
[both] Tommy Bahama.

209
00:11:31,876 --> 00:11:33,610
Put that with a 24-hour CVS

210
00:11:33,644 --> 00:11:35,512
and you got yourself a party.

211
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:39,016
I mean best week of my life.
You girls have got to go.

212
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:41,084
- Well, not the best...
- Oh, yeah, no.

213
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,386
- We're not...
- Time right now.

214
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:43,454
We're not in a place

215
00:11:43,855 --> 00:11:45,189
- to really go anywhere.
- We can't really leave.

216
00:11:45,222 --> 00:11:46,457
I'll drop off a brochure later.

217
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,159
- Oh, wow. Thank you.
- Oh, yeah.

218
00:11:49,193 --> 00:11:50,594
- That won't be necessary.
- I mean, yeah.

219
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,362
It'd be nice to see
what it looks like.

220
00:11:52,396 --> 00:11:53,597
What's the name
of the place again?

221
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,365
Vista Del Mar!

222
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,204
- View of the swordfish.
- View of the mar.

223
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:05,576
[Debbie] <i>Before we begin
I just wanna thank</i>

224
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:08,645
Barb and Star for hosting
tonight's talking club

225
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:10,647
and for making their famous,

226
00:12:11,114 --> 00:12:14,485
usual hot dog soup. Again.

227
00:12:14,518 --> 00:12:16,453
- You're welcome.
- It's a simple recipe.

228
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:18,388
- Simple.
- Oh, Gail's not here,

229
00:12:18,422 --> 00:12:21,725
but it's 6:00 on the dot.
So, it's time to lock the door.

230
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:26,396
- [knocking on door]
- [Gail] I'm here.

231
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,265
You're late Gail, buh-bye.

232
00:12:30,634 --> 00:12:34,071
Well, Talking Club
is officially in session.

233
00:12:34,104 --> 00:12:37,174
I was really hoping to talk
this week about horses.

234
00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:39,276
Specifically my horse,

235
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:41,211
and the spectacular time
we had...

236
00:12:41,245 --> 00:12:43,213
You know the rules, Delores.

237
00:12:43,247 --> 00:12:45,382
We only share about the topic

238
00:12:45,415 --> 00:12:47,384
that we pick out
of the talking jar.

239
00:12:48,252 --> 00:12:49,486
Give me your soup.

240
00:13:00,097 --> 00:13:01,665
Today's topic is...

241
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,668
jobs.

242
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:05,402
[women groan]

243
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,173
[Pinky] I wanted to talk about
my job at the Christmas store.

244
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:13,243
I know everyone thinks
it's not busy right now,

245
00:13:13,277 --> 00:13:16,246
but we are... all year round.

246
00:13:17,581 --> 00:13:19,583
- I believe you.
- Thank you.

247
00:13:20,018 --> 00:13:22,119
Well, I love my job
at the pharmacy.

248
00:13:22,787 --> 00:13:24,621
I get to play with the pills,

249
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:27,658
and sometimes I shake them
along to the music.

250
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:30,527
Star, we can't tell the ladies
what happened today.

251
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,596
What? You mean lie? We can't.

252
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:35,132
Oh, we just lost our job
at the hottest place in town.

253
00:13:35,165 --> 00:13:36,633
- What will they think of us?
- [Debbie] Oh,

254
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:38,201
and I love my uniform.

255
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:39,336
It's all white,

256
00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:42,673
so I get to set myself apart
with character socks.

257
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,275
- [all gasp]
- Those look fun.

258
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:48,178
These have coffee cups
and coffee beans on them.

259
00:13:48,211 --> 00:13:50,647
- [laughs] I wish you dress me.
- I don't have time.

260
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:53,116
Barb and Star?
What about you guys?

261
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,285
I mean, you guys work at the
hottest place in town!

262
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:57,220
Maybe socks
would be a good topic.

263
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:59,356
Oh, yes. I love the socks
without ankle.

264
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:02,292
Barb, Star, the topic is jobs.

265
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:06,296
Tell us about your jobs.

266
00:14:06,798 --> 00:14:08,498
- Oh. Well...
- Oh.

267
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:13,537
- [both] Uh... Today was...
- Uh, it was busy.

268
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,271
- It was busy.
- Yeah.

269
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:17,574
[both] So, we had a lot of...
Big delivery.

270
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,710
- [Star] One big delivery.
- With furniture.

271
00:14:19,743 --> 00:14:21,345
- And sofa.
- Tables.

272
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:22,679
[both] There was a guy.

273
00:14:22,713 --> 00:14:24,548
- [Star] He was delivering,
- [both] He was tall.

274
00:14:24,748 --> 00:14:27,517
- [Barb] The other was shorter.
- [both] Not as tall.

275
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:29,620
- [Star] We filled out paperwork.
- Inventory.

276
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:30,487
Did everything.

277
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:33,357
- Then we had to load it all in.
- [Barb] To look at the samples.

278
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,525
- ...brought the samples.
- [Star] ...clipboard.

279
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,829
- [Barb] Made some tea.
- We signed up.

280
00:14:37,862 --> 00:14:40,330
[both] And then
we got a promotion.

281
00:14:40,364 --> 00:14:41,365
- Oh!
- What?

282
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,567
- Wow!
- Congrats.

283
00:14:43,768 --> 00:14:45,402
[Gail]
Congratulations you guys!

284
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:47,905
- Go home, Gail.
- [woman] We're so proud of you.

285
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:49,539
We should do a toast.

286
00:14:49,573 --> 00:14:50,908
[neighs]

287
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:55,445
What? That's how
I cheers with my horse.

288
00:14:56,413 --> 00:14:58,916
[snorts, chuckles]

289
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:02,619
Barb and I lost our jobs.

290
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,454
[gasp]

291
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,657
Sorry. The store closed.

292
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,292
And the story we just told you
about the delivery,

293
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,328
the men coming,
the trucks, the nightstands,

294
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:12,663
the fabric samples, the couches,

295
00:15:12,696 --> 00:15:15,332
the tall guy and the shorter guy
that wasn't as tall?

296
00:15:15,365 --> 00:15:16,968
- That was a lie! [whimpers]
- [gasp]

297
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:18,301
Oh, damn.

298
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:23,340
We all know there are only three
major rules in Talking Club.

299
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:26,410
Rule number one, no sneakers.

300
00:15:26,978 --> 00:15:30,213
Rule number two, no swearing
except for the "F" word.

301
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:34,451
Rule number three, no lying.

302
00:15:34,484 --> 00:15:36,520
You two are banned
from the club.

303
00:15:36,553 --> 00:15:37,354
- What?
- What?

304
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:39,824
[Debbie] Ladies, grab your
purses, and pocket books.

305
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:42,492
- [Barb] No, Debbie, please.
- Isn't there like

306
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:44,227
a three-strike rule
or something?

307
00:15:44,261 --> 00:15:46,530
Please, we won't do it again.
This is all we have left.

308
00:15:46,563 --> 00:15:48,298
- Can we have one more chance?
- [Star] One more chance.

309
00:15:48,331 --> 00:15:49,733
- [Barb] Please.
- [Star] It was just one lie.

310
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:52,003
- [Barb] Give us a chance.
- We don't know what to say.

311
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:55,372
[dramatic music playing]

312
00:15:55,405 --> 00:15:56,640
[door closes]

313
00:15:58,943 --> 00:16:02,412
Barb, are you upset with me?
I'm sorry I blurted it out.

314
00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:05,482
[Barb] Star, no.
I can never be upset with you.

315
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:09,519
It's okay, we lied.
We deserved it.

316
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:13,958
Do you know
they make denim culottes?

317
00:16:14,992 --> 00:16:16,593
They're for our weather.

318
00:16:16,626 --> 00:16:18,428
Do you think
Jennifer Convertibles closing

319
00:16:18,462 --> 00:16:19,463
was a sign?

320
00:16:19,931 --> 00:16:21,799
And getting kicked out
of Talking Club?

321
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:23,835
A sign?

322
00:16:24,634 --> 00:16:27,304
Okay. You know those days
when you see me

323
00:16:27,337 --> 00:16:29,339
- just staring at the carpet?
- Yes.

324
00:16:29,372 --> 00:16:30,975
Sometimes I daydream.

325
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:33,577
About life
outside of this place.

326
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:37,748
Maybe something is telling us
to do something different.

327
00:16:37,782 --> 00:16:40,517
- Oh, my gosh. Yes.
- Yes? Oh!

328
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,887
Should we try those socks
with individual toes? [laughs]

329
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,354
- Yeah.
- What do they feel like?

330
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:45,089
I've always wondered.

331
00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:48,291
I wonder how my toes will react.
They've always been together.

332
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:49,259
I think they'll like it.

333
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:51,595
- What if it's something bigger?
- Like what?

334
00:16:52,196 --> 00:16:54,899
- Like this.
- [tropical tune plays]

335
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,399
- A trip?
- Yes.

336
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:57,869
- Star...
- No, look,

337
00:16:57,902 --> 00:17:00,037
look at these two people.
Look how happy they are.

338
00:17:00,071 --> 00:17:02,472
Imagine that's you and me
riding on that banana boat.

339
00:17:02,506 --> 00:17:04,008
Just bouncing around

340
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,343
with our arms and legs
spread wide open

341
00:17:06,376 --> 00:17:08,980
with water and air
going all inside of us.

342
00:17:09,013 --> 00:17:10,614
This is dangerous.

343
00:17:10,647 --> 00:17:12,049
Things happen to people
on trips.

344
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,650
What if we get lost,
or poisoned,

345
00:17:13,683 --> 00:17:15,685
or we get a rash?
What if they put us in jail

346
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:17,420
'cause they think
we put drugs in our butts?

347
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,421
What if we fall out of a car?

348
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,758
Have you heard
of traveler's diarrhea, Star?

349
00:17:21,591 --> 00:17:25,863
Your stomach doesn't care where
you are, it just releases.

350
00:17:25,897 --> 00:17:27,865
Haven't you ever wondered
if the real ocean

351
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:29,399
sounds like our noise machine?

352
00:17:29,432 --> 00:17:31,102
The real ocean
has strong currents.

353
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,938
And people get swept out,
and they sink and they drown.

354
00:17:36,007 --> 00:17:37,340
[sighs] Okay.

355
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:40,812
I know things changed for you
after Ron died.

356
00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:42,814
They certainly did for me
after Carmine Left.

357
00:17:42,847 --> 00:17:44,949
But we used to have fun.

358
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,785
Remember that one time
we went on a haunted hay ride?

359
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:49,787
- [both chuckle]
- And we got chased by that man

360
00:17:49,821 --> 00:17:51,655
with a Jack-o'-lantern head
and a chainsaw.

361
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:52,689
And then we heard later

362
00:17:52,957 --> 00:17:55,559
he wasn't an actor, he just
escaped from the local prison.

363
00:17:55,592 --> 00:17:56,994
- [laughs] He was a real killer.
- Killer.

364
00:17:57,028 --> 00:17:58,896
- He was trying to kill us.
- [both] Oh.

365
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,531
Remember the 4th of July when
we roller skated through town

366
00:18:01,565 --> 00:18:02,967
in our sequined leotards?

367
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,902
And my sparkler
caught your hair on fire?

368
00:18:04,936 --> 00:18:06,838
And then my hair
caught your hair on fire.

369
00:18:06,871 --> 00:18:09,807
[both laughing] We caught
each other's hair on fire.

370
00:18:10,473 --> 00:18:11,575
Oh.

371
00:18:13,978 --> 00:18:19,817
Barb, I feel like...
we lost our... shimmer.

372
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:23,620
Isn't that just what happens
when you get older?

373
00:18:23,653 --> 00:18:25,722
No. I mean, it doesn't have to.

374
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:28,025
We still have a chance
to be those people again.

375
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:30,627
[scoffs] I mean,
look all of our stories.

376
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,129
They're... they're from the past.

377
00:18:32,163 --> 00:18:34,564
We don't
have any stories from now.

378
00:18:36,868 --> 00:18:39,569
I feel like we're fading away.

379
00:18:40,637 --> 00:18:42,139
I don't wanna fade away.

380
00:18:42,173 --> 00:18:44,574
Hey, look, I know you're afraid
something is gonna go wrong,

381
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:46,844
but what if it doesn't?

382
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:49,046
What if we go there
and have a time of our lives?

383
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,082
We lay on the beach
and we feel the sun

384
00:18:51,115 --> 00:18:52,850
and we have breakfast
and have muffins

385
00:18:52,884 --> 00:18:54,651
and croissants
with all kinds of jelly...

386
00:18:54,684 --> 00:18:56,120
- Let's do it.
- What?

387
00:18:56,787 --> 00:18:59,824
I can't believe I'm saying this.
Let's throw caution to the wind

388
00:18:59,857 --> 00:19:01,524
like a couple
of rock and rollers!

389
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:02,793
- [Star] Really?
- Yes.

390
00:19:03,526 --> 00:19:04,795
- Barb.
- Star.

391
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,199
[both]
Let's go to Vista Del Mar.

392
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:09,633
[both squeal]

393
00:19:11,168 --> 00:19:13,104
[Barb] I'm gonna bring those
culottes I bought at Kaboom.

394
00:19:13,137 --> 00:19:14,872
- [Star] Culottes?
- [Barb] My fringe shorts.

395
00:19:14,906 --> 00:19:16,473
- [Star] Tangerine pants.
- [Barb] Oh, my curlers.

396
00:19:16,506 --> 00:19:18,608
I don't want anything
to happen to my curlers.

397
00:19:19,977 --> 00:19:21,511
- Anyway...
- [Star] Cheese pizza.

398
00:19:21,544 --> 00:19:23,680
Gosh, let me
just get mushroom. Well.

399
00:19:23,713 --> 00:19:25,850
[Barb] Traveler's checks.
Leftover from my wedding.

400
00:19:25,883 --> 00:19:27,785
[Star] For the shower.
Safety first.

401
00:19:27,818 --> 00:19:30,221
[Barb] Always good to bring
a little piece of art

402
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:32,123
- from home.
- [Star] We're gonna buy a lot

403
00:19:32,156 --> 00:19:33,556
- of Florida cookies.
- [Barb] Some rope.

404
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,892
[Star] This is gonna be
for the cheese pizza.

405
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:36,160
[Barb] My curlers.

406
00:19:36,693 --> 00:19:39,462
[Star] This is a toilet
scrubber and a back scrubber.

407
00:19:39,496 --> 00:19:41,933
[Barb] Maybe it's time
to put the curlers in.

408
00:19:41,966 --> 00:19:44,101
- [Star] Vista Del Mar...
- [Barb] Here we come.

409
00:19:45,236 --> 00:19:48,873
[suspenseful music playing]

410
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:53,044
What's on your mind?

411
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:55,179
[Dr. Lady] I'm just nervous
something is going to go wrong.

412
00:19:55,212 --> 00:19:57,214
I even tried
to distract myself today

413
00:19:57,248 --> 00:19:59,784
by training some of the mice
from the lab.

414
00:19:59,817 --> 00:20:02,652
Everything is going to be
fine. I promise.

415
00:20:02,686 --> 00:20:04,155
I want you to get there early.

416
00:20:04,188 --> 00:20:05,655
Get the lay of the land.

417
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:07,158
Here's the microchip.

418
00:20:07,191 --> 00:20:09,994
The receiver cannot
be activated without it.

419
00:20:10,027 --> 00:20:12,529
Be very careful with it.
It's fragile.

420
00:20:13,431 --> 00:20:14,966
There's a compartment for it
in your belt.

421
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,934
Yoyo designed it.

422
00:20:17,168 --> 00:20:18,970
God, I love that little boy...

423
00:20:19,937 --> 00:20:21,172
And most importantly...

424
00:20:22,073 --> 00:20:23,240
the antidote.

425
00:20:23,274 --> 00:20:24,607
You might get stung.

426
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,844
This will make you
immune to the poison.

427
00:20:26,877 --> 00:20:30,580
- I won't let you down, my love.
- No, you won't.

428
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:36,754
I've been working on this plan
my entire life.

429
00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:41,826
And now, it's finally time.

430
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:43,928
[Edgar] I can't wait for all
of this to be over.

431
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:45,963
After what those people
did to you,

432
00:20:45,997 --> 00:20:47,098
and for you to be happy,

433
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:50,034
and for us to be
an official couple.

434
00:20:54,939 --> 00:20:56,173
Um...

435
00:21:00,011 --> 00:21:01,711
Mm-hmm. Yes.

436
00:21:02,746 --> 00:21:04,581
You do wanna be together, right?

437
00:21:05,615 --> 00:21:07,852
- Be an official couple?
- Mm-hmm.

438
00:21:10,087 --> 00:21:11,155
Yes, of course I do.

439
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:12,757
[chuckles] I'm just, um,

440
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,692
it's hard for me relax.
You know, until this is over.

441
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:18,062
- You understand.
- Yeah.

442
00:21:18,095 --> 00:21:19,263
So...

443
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:22,833
don't screw it up.

Woo! Well, I was not
prepared for that take off.

Me neither.

452

Ma'am, I apologize for screaming
at the top of my lungs.

453
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:45,790
Mm.

454
00:21:46,457 --> 00:21:49,626
- What? A free magazine! [gasps]
- What?

455
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:51,829
I have got to read
this interview with Don Cheadle.

456
00:21:52,096 --> 00:21:54,664
Oh, I love him.
You know that reminds me,

457
00:21:54,697 --> 00:21:56,367
the other day
I said to myself...

458
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,803
I cannot think of a famous
actress named Trish.

459
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,172
You're kidding.
That's my favorite name.

460
00:22:01,205 --> 00:22:04,241
What? Mine too! How did we
never talk about this?

461
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:08,813
To me, a woman named Trish
is a woman you can count on.

462
00:22:08,846 --> 00:22:11,748
Really has her act together.
Athletic, natural.

463
00:22:11,782 --> 00:22:14,085
Just real natural.
And loves the holidays.

Trish? At Christmas? Forget it.

She gets everybody a gift.

466
00:22:18,189 --> 00:22:19,924
- What about Halloween?
- Oh.

467
00:22:19,957 --> 00:22:22,293
Trish leaves a big pot
of candy for the kids.

468
00:22:22,326 --> 00:22:24,261
- Yeah.
- [both] Because she trusts.

469
00:22:24,295 --> 00:22:25,763
- [chuckle]
- [Barb] She'd be out

470
00:22:25,796 --> 00:22:27,131
- with her girlfriends.
- [Star] Country-dancing.

471
00:22:27,164 --> 00:22:28,866
[Barb] She has a natural
sense of rhythm.

472
00:22:28,899 --> 00:22:30,367
She'd have one ear
double-pierced.

473
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:32,036
- And the other...
- Just single.

474

for a job at Talbots,

- I told them my name was Trish.
- What? [laughs]

476

I was in that hit and run

477

- Uh-huh.

- Her name was Trish. Yeah.
- Really?

479
00:22:42,213 --> 00:22:44,181
[Barb] Trish loses one of her
ears in a twister,

480
00:22:44,215 --> 00:22:46,317
- but not her hearing.
- She's a storm chaser.

481
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,052
Her mom doesn't want her to be.

482
00:22:48,085 --> 00:22:49,887
- Their relationship is tough.
- Hmm.

483
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,123
Trish always wanted to be
a portrait photographer.

484
00:22:52,156 --> 00:22:54,657
She loves people.
She would always say,

"A person's face says
a lot about how they look."

486

- Oh, that's beautiful.
- Yeah.

487
00:22:58,262 --> 00:22:59,163
[Star] Okay.

488
00:22:59,196 --> 00:23:01,031
- Trish's favorite number?
- [both] Four.

489
00:23:01,065 --> 00:23:02,833
- Her favorite animal?
- [both] Hen!

490

- Oh.

"You know what, skin cancer?

"You are not gonna take me.

"Because I'm gonna take
my own life."

496
00:23:16,947 --> 00:23:17,915
And she did.

497
00:23:18,983 --> 00:23:22,286
She jumped off that cliff
near her house on the Cape.

498
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,888
Dove right into the water,

And now there's a beautiful
spirit out there in the ocean.

00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:33,998
And you know what her name is?

502
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:39,336

00:50:25,877 --> 00:50:27,845
I felt non-disgusting.
[chuckles]

1079
00:50:28,478 --> 00:50:30,714
I mean, you saw
my folds and holes

1080
00:50:30,747 --> 00:50:32,716
- and you didn't run away.
- [camera shutter clicks]

1081
00:50:33,017 --> 00:50:34,751
Now, I'm just starting
to realize that maybe

1082
00:50:34,786 --> 00:50:36,888
having meaningless flings
is the way to go.

1083
00:50:37,287 --> 00:50:39,589
No one gets hurt.
No strings attached.

1084
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:43,693
It's just you shouldn't have
to try to make someone love you.

1085
00:50:43,727 --> 00:50:45,595
That's all.
I don't know.

1086
00:50:47,832 --> 00:50:49,066
I know what you mean.

1087
00:50:50,034 --> 00:50:51,035
You do?

1088
00:50:54,071 --> 00:50:56,974
Plus, you put all your faith
in someone and, poof,

1089
00:50:57,541 --> 00:50:59,743
they turn out
to be someone else.

1090
00:50:59,777 --> 00:51:01,645
[gasps] I once heard this story
about a woman

1091
00:51:01,678 --> 00:51:03,815
who married a doctor,
turns out

1092
00:51:03,848 --> 00:51:05,615
he was Bruce Springsteen.

1093
00:51:05,649 --> 00:51:07,584
I guess he just wanted
to be a regular person

1094
00:51:07,617 --> 00:51:09,319
for a little while or something.

1095
00:51:09,754 --> 00:51:11,588
I remember one year
for Halloween,

1096
00:51:11,621 --> 00:51:13,423
Barb went as Bruce Springsteen.

1097
00:51:14,058 --> 00:51:16,326
Oh, my God. Barb.

1098
00:51:17,061 --> 00:51:19,629
What am I doing?
She thinks I'm sleeping.

1099
00:51:19,663 --> 00:51:22,599
I lied to her, and I think
she might have feelings for you.

1100
00:51:22,632 --> 00:51:25,102
- Oh, no. I don't think she...
- I've been a terrible friend.

1101
00:51:25,136 --> 00:51:26,871
[scoffs]
And I ruined that pillow.

1102
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:30,407
Oh, Edgar...
[scoffs] I should go.

1103
00:51:30,842 --> 00:51:32,676
Which means
we don't have a lot of time.

1104
00:51:32,709 --> 00:51:34,045
Gosh, I need you inside me.

1105
00:51:34,078 --> 00:51:36,746
Let's go make love against
those hard wooden stairs.

1106
00:51:39,516 --> 00:51:41,484
[both exhales]

1107
00:51:42,419 --> 00:51:45,923
Edgar. Oh, thanks for letting me
talk through this

1108
00:51:45,957 --> 00:51:47,657
and letting me
ride you like that.

1109
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:50,127
[giggles]
Now, I get meaningless sex.

1110
00:51:50,161 --> 00:51:52,596
It feels good physically,
and that's all.

1111
00:51:52,629 --> 00:51:53,931
Star that was...

1112
00:51:56,801 --> 00:51:57,969
that was amazing.

1113
00:52:00,171 --> 00:52:02,173
I mean, it was really,
really different.

1114
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:04,441
- Did I bounce too much?
- No.

1115
00:52:04,474 --> 00:52:05,475
Oh, good.

1116
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,677
That was so lovely.

1117
00:52:08,478 --> 00:52:10,047
Listen, I really
have to get back.

1118
00:52:10,081 --> 00:52:11,983
Barb, can never know about this.

1119
00:52:12,016 --> 00:52:13,617
Gosh, gotta go.

1120
00:52:16,586 --> 00:52:18,956
- Let's do it one more time.
- Oh, yup. Yup. Please.

1121
00:52:39,877 --> 00:52:42,947
- [lamp switch clicking]
- [eerie music playing]

1122
00:52:50,553 --> 00:52:51,822
What are you doing?

1123
00:52:53,556 --> 00:52:55,026
Oh, I was just playing
with this lamp.

1124
00:52:55,059 --> 00:52:57,094
- Oh. [laughs]
- [Barb] I got a little reflux.

1125
00:52:57,128 --> 00:52:58,461
And I tried to wake you,

1126
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,131
but I saw you put a pillow
in the bed.

1127
00:53:00,164 --> 00:53:03,466
Was that just a funny joke?
I laughed but then I wondered.

1128
00:53:03,733 --> 00:53:06,003
Oh, um, I just didn't wanna
make you up.

1129
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:10,507
You know, I didn't know
how long I was gonna be out.

1130
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,508
Oh, thank God.

1131
00:53:11,842 --> 00:53:14,544
I thought maybe you went down
to the ocean and got swept away.

1132
00:53:14,577 --> 00:53:16,080
[chuckles]
Where did you go?

1133
00:53:16,113 --> 00:53:17,815
I just went out
to clear my head.

1134
00:53:17,848 --> 00:53:21,018
You know, get some of that
salty breeze in my lungs.

1135
00:53:21,052 --> 00:53:23,486
- Okay.
- And went for a walk with...

1136
00:53:25,957 --> 00:53:27,091
a turtle.

1137
00:53:28,259 --> 00:53:29,293
- A turtle?
- You know, I just

1138
00:53:29,526 --> 00:53:33,864
wanna make sure he was safe,
so I-I... made sure he got home.

1139
00:53:34,265 --> 00:53:36,901
You went to a turtle's house?

1140
00:53:36,934 --> 00:53:38,601
I went to a turtle's house.

1141
00:53:38,635 --> 00:53:40,570
[squeals] Where do they
live around here?

1142
00:53:40,603 --> 00:53:43,074
Oh, over by bushes. [chuckles]
How was your bath?

1143
00:53:43,774 --> 00:53:44,809
Oh.

1144
00:53:46,043 --> 00:53:48,112
- It was good. Good tub.
- Good.

1145
00:53:48,511 --> 00:53:51,648
I just stayed in there,
the whole time.

1146
00:53:51,681 --> 00:53:52,749
Well, good for you.

1147
00:53:52,783 --> 00:53:57,188
Well, I was really relaxed,
and the water was warm.

1148
00:53:57,221 --> 00:53:59,857
And I...

1149
00:54:01,092 --> 00:54:02,692
saw a turtle.

1150
00:54:02,726 --> 00:54:04,627
[scoffs] In the tub?

1151
00:54:04,661 --> 00:54:05,896
Yup. A baby one.

1152
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:07,832
He just floated up
out of the drain,

1153
00:54:07,865 --> 00:54:10,101
and he swam around,
and he splashed me.

1154
00:54:10,134 --> 00:54:11,302
And I tried to pet him,

1155
00:54:11,335 --> 00:54:13,270
- but he got scared.
- 'Cause your big?

1156
00:54:13,304 --> 00:54:15,940
So much bigger than him.
He went back down.

1157
00:54:15,973 --> 00:54:19,110
And, uh, anyway, that's why
you can't see him right now.

1158
00:54:20,044 --> 00:54:21,812
- Wow.
- [both chuckle]

1159
00:54:23,147 --> 00:54:24,614
We should probably hit the hay.

1160
00:54:24,647 --> 00:54:26,217
Yes. Let's go to bed.
I'm tired.

1161
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:32,323
Anyway, I'm so happy
to be here with you.

1162
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:34,691
Well, I'm so happy
to be here with you.

1163
00:54:35,725 --> 00:54:37,828
- Good night.
- Good night, Star.

1164
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:53,878
[ominous music playing]

1165
00:55:01,252 --> 00:55:02,253
[gasps]

1166
00:55:04,654 --> 00:55:05,890
Yoyo.

1167
00:55:06,791 --> 00:55:08,225
- I love it.
- [sighs]

1168
00:55:08,259 --> 00:55:10,194
I'm so happy I built you
that craft room.

1169
00:55:10,795 --> 00:55:13,596
Now, let's go over the plan
one last time.

1170
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:15,199
- Are you ready?
- Why does this plan

1171
00:55:15,232 --> 00:55:16,801
mean so much to you, huh?

1172
00:55:16,834 --> 00:55:19,036
Oh, Yoyo.

1173
00:55:21,005 --> 00:55:22,273
Bring me my chair.

1174
00:55:22,807 --> 00:55:24,175
Where shall I begin?

1175
00:55:25,409 --> 00:55:27,111
I was born here in Taylorsville.

1176
00:55:27,812 --> 00:55:31,115
<i>I was also born with a skin
condition the doctors called</i>

1177
00:55:31,148 --> 00:55:35,219
<i>pigmentatia-degenera-hysterica-
whiteskinika.</i>

1178
00:55:35,252 --> 00:55:37,088
Is it serious?

1179
00:55:37,121 --> 00:55:39,790
It is serious. You have
to take care of yourself.

1180
00:55:39,824 --> 00:55:41,292
You have to stay
out of the sunlight.

1181
00:55:41,325 --> 00:55:43,994
[Dr. Lady] <i>Leaving me
forever allergic to the sun.</i>

1182

<i>When I was seven years old,
my father got a job</i>

1183
00:55:47,131 --> 00:55:48,933
<i>that would change our lives.</i>

1184
00:55:48,966 --> 00:55:50,901
<i>We packed up and moved
to a small town</i>

1185
00:55:50,935 --> 00:55:52,336
<i>in Florida called...</i>

1186
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:55,272
Vista Del Mar.

1187
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:58,776
<i>At my new school,
everyone made fun of me</i>

1188
00:55:58,809 --> 00:56:00,244
<i>because of the way
that I looked.</i>

1189
00:56:00,277 --> 00:56:01,744
<i>They would call me names like...</i>

1190
00:56:01,779 --> 00:56:02,880
- <i>pale girl...</i>
- Pale girl.

1191
00:56:03,114 --> 00:56:04,949
- [Dr. Lady] <i>...white devil...</i>
- White devil.

1192
00:56:04,982 --> 00:56:06,749
- [Dr. Lady] <i>...and asshole.</i>
- Asshole.

1193
00:56:07,218 --> 00:56:09,386
[Dr. Lady]
<i>I finally made one friend.</i>

1194
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,889
<i>Her name was Maria Margolis.</i>

1195
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:15,059
She would stay inside with me.

1196
00:56:15,092 --> 00:56:17,694
We would read
and create inventions,

1197
00:56:17,727 --> 00:56:19,029
cook food from her culture.

1198

- <i>right in front of me.</i>
- [Maria screaming]

1202
00:56:31,008 --> 00:56:32,409
Really gobbled her up.

1203
00:56:34,979 --> 00:56:36,914
She was my last friend.

<i>Years later,

One of them about to be crowned

<i>a group of popular girls</i>

- I didn't get it.
- [chuckles]

1538
01:12:24,095 --> 01:12:26,063
I'm gonna be... Yeah.
[chuckles]

1539
01:12:26,629 --> 01:12:29,699
Okay.
[mumbles, chuckles]

1540
01:12:30,201 --> 01:12:31,335
Hmm?

1541
01:12:33,337 --> 01:12:34,737
[elevator door dings]

1542
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:41,846
- [elevator door dings]
- [dramatic music playing]

1543
01:12:41,879 --> 01:12:43,114
[panting]

1544
01:12:45,015 --> 01:12:46,016
Star.

1545
01:12:48,119 --> 01:12:50,855
[Edgar] Well, I don't know
how much clearer I can be.

1546
01:12:53,924 --> 01:12:55,826
I've changed my mind.

1547
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:57,228
I see now, you've been using me.

1548
01:12:57,261 --> 01:12:59,696
[Dr. Lady]
<i>Edgar, don't be silly.</i>

1549
01:12:59,729 --> 01:13:01,031
<i>We're almost at
the finish line.</i>

1550
01:13:01,065 --> 01:13:04,168
And you and I can be official.

1551
01:13:04,368 --> 01:13:05,803
Don't even try.

1552
01:13:05,836 --> 01:13:07,805
You know,
I've figured it all out.

1553
01:13:07,838 --> 01:13:09,807
You pretended to loved me.

1554
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,242
You made me a bunch of promises

1555
01:13:11,275 --> 01:13:12,776
so that I would come down here

1556
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:14,778
and place the receiver
on the stage,

1557
01:13:14,812 --> 01:13:16,746
in the middle
of the Seafood Jam party,

1558
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:18,449
that will attract
thousands of deadly mosquitoes

1559
01:13:18,482 --> 01:13:20,451
that are gonna kill
thousands of people.

1560
01:13:20,484 --> 01:13:22,153
[woman] Excuse me.

1561
01:13:22,186 --> 01:13:25,823
Did you get that leaf and pearl
necklace down by the boardwalk?

1562
01:13:25,856 --> 01:13:29,293
[whispering] Oh, yes.
I got it at Baleafy Ornate.

1563
01:13:29,326 --> 01:13:30,794
I'm sorry. What?

1564
01:13:30,828 --> 01:13:33,130
- Baleafy Ornate.
- What?

1565
01:13:33,164 --> 01:13:35,466
And not that you care,
but I have met someone.

1566
01:13:35,499 --> 01:13:38,769
And unlike you, I know... I know
what real love feels like,

1567
01:13:38,802 --> 01:13:40,871
and it is not
how you've treated me.

1568
01:13:41,438 --> 01:13:45,042
- It feels amazing and special.
- [Dr. Lady] <i>Oh, Edgar,</i>

1569
01:13:45,075 --> 01:13:47,311
I really hate to be the one
to tell you this.

1570
01:13:47,344 --> 01:13:48,979
<i>You know, you... your girlfriend</i>

1571
01:13:49,013 --> 01:13:51,282
<i>and her little partner,
the ones with the fluffy hair</i>

1572
01:13:51,315 --> 01:13:54,018
- <i>and the culottes.</i>
- How do you know about them?

1573
01:13:54,051 --> 01:13:57,488
Their spies, Edgar. They're not
who they say they are

1574
01:13:57,521 --> 01:13:59,456
and they've been playing you
all along.

1575
01:14:00,357 --> 01:14:02,725
- You're lying.
- [Dr. Lady] <i>I wish I was.</i>

1576
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:03,460
<i>Luckily,</i>

1577
01:14:03,726 --> 01:14:06,297
I have some inside sources
at their agency.

1578
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:07,932
What agency?
Who do they work for?

1579
01:14:08,165 --> 01:14:12,436
-The H... P... V.

1580
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:15,839
- Sounds familiar.
- [Dr. Lady] <i>Check your emails.</i>

1581
01:14:15,873 --> 01:14:18,108
We've intercepted some
of the photos they've sent back

1582
01:14:18,142 --> 01:14:19,810
<i>to headquarters.
I think you'll find</i>

1583
01:14:19,843 --> 01:14:21,779
there are some interesting ones.

1584
01:14:24,515 --> 01:14:27,151
<i>It all looks very fun.</i>

1585
01:14:27,184 --> 01:14:29,286
- Star, no.
- <i>Oh,</i>

1586
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,221
I know, Edgar,

1587
01:14:30,487 --> 01:14:33,857
this must hurt that she
lied to you about loving you.

1588
01:14:34,225 --> 01:14:35,292
<i>And I don't blame you</i>

1589
01:14:35,326 --> 01:14:37,461
<i>about running into the arms
of another woman.</i>

1590
01:14:37,494 --> 01:14:39,863
<i>I hadn't been there for you,
and I'm so sorry.</i>

1591
01:14:39,897 --> 01:14:43,901
Let's get away after this,
find a little place in Portugal

1592
01:14:43,934 --> 01:14:45,936
<i>where we can be official.</i>

1593
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:48,806
I got the necklace
at Baleafy Ornate.

1594
01:14:48,839 --> 01:14:51,242
- I cannot hear you. What?
- Baleafy Ornate.

1595
01:14:51,275 --> 01:14:52,243
It's called Baleafy Ornate!

1596
01:14:52,576 --> 01:14:54,445
It sells everything bay leaf!

1597
01:14:54,478 --> 01:14:57,348
It's a play on words!
My God, lady!

1598
01:14:57,381 --> 01:14:58,382
Okay.

1599
01:15:00,384 --> 01:15:01,852
- Oh.
- [glass shatters]

1600
01:15:04,922 --> 01:15:06,056
[Barb] Sorry I yelled.

1601
01:15:06,457 --> 01:15:07,358
- Sorry.
- Shit!

1602
01:15:07,725 --> 01:15:08,559
What shit?

1603
01:15:08,792 --> 01:15:11,128
It was Barb, the other one.
She was listening

1604
01:15:11,161 --> 01:15:12,930
<i>at the door.
Damn, they're good...</i>

1605
01:15:12,963 --> 01:15:15,065
spies.
I can't believe this.

1606
01:15:15,466 --> 01:15:18,836
Edgar, you listen to me
and you listen to me good.

1607
01:15:27,444 --> 01:15:29,346
- Edgar?
- I'm listening.

1608
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:31,315
Okay. I just wanted to make
sure you could still hear me.

1609
01:15:31,348 --> 01:15:33,217
Sometimes
the connection in here...

1610
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:33,951
<i>Anyway,</i>

1611
01:15:34,251 --> 01:15:38,122
I need you to find those two.
And kill them.

1612
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:42,459
Star.

1613
01:15:43,961 --> 01:15:44,962
Star!

1614
01:15:46,497 --> 01:15:48,065
[coughs]

1615
01:15:48,098 --> 01:15:50,234
Oh, don't bother
pretending to be sick anymore.

1616
01:15:50,267 --> 01:15:52,102
I know all
about your little lies.

1617
01:15:52,136 --> 01:15:54,171
And I know all
about you and Edgar.

1618
01:15:54,204 --> 01:15:56,240
And guess what?
He's a bad man!

1619
01:15:56,273 --> 01:15:57,508
And he's gonna do
something terrible!

1620
01:15:57,808 --> 01:15:58,742
- What?
- He's following orders

1621
01:15:59,076 --> 01:16:01,011
from someone. I overheard him
on the phone with his boss.

1622
01:16:01,045 --> 01:16:01,780
His boss from Clamco?

1623
01:16:02,012 --> 01:16:04,415
No, Star! He lied to you!
He's a killer!

1624
01:16:04,448 --> 01:16:05,482
A killer?

1625
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:09,887
But, Barb, what you're saying
is ridiculous.

1626
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:11,555
There's nothing ridiculous
about what I'm saying.

1627
01:16:11,588 --> 01:16:13,490
Edgar put a receiver
in the middle of the Seafood Jam

1628
01:16:13,524 --> 01:16:15,626
that'll trigger deadly mosquitos
that'll fly into the crowd

1629
01:16:15,659 --> 01:16:17,861
and sting everybody
with their killer tails!

1630
01:16:18,562 --> 01:16:21,098
Why are you doing this?
[gasps]

1631
01:16:23,067 --> 01:16:25,302
- You're making this all up!
- Oh, come on.

1632
01:16:25,336 --> 01:16:26,437
I cannot believe you.

1633
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:29,273
You're mad
because Edgar picked me!

1634
01:16:29,306 --> 01:16:31,375
Get me a break.
I am not mad about that.

1635
01:16:31,408 --> 01:16:33,277
And I am not making it up.

1636
01:16:33,778 --> 01:16:36,113
- I'm calling the police.
- [scoffs] Fine.

1637
01:16:38,148 --> 01:16:39,950
Jeff's Banana Boats?

1638
01:16:40,651 --> 01:16:42,019
I didn't go through with it.

1639
01:16:42,052 --> 01:16:43,921
While I was lying here
in my deathbed?

1640
01:16:43,954 --> 01:16:45,422
- You weren't sick.
- You didn't know that?

1641
01:16:45,456 --> 01:16:47,524
- Because you lied.
- So did you.

1642
01:16:47,558 --> 01:16:48,892
[both scoff]

1643
01:16:51,428 --> 01:16:53,130
I should have gone
on that banana boat.

1644
01:16:53,163 --> 01:16:54,598
- I wish I did.
- Oh.

1645
01:16:54,631 --> 01:16:57,935
[Edgar] I hear it's a real
tit flapper.

1646
01:16:58,602 --> 01:16:59,503
[gasps]

1647

1648
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:04,174
Uh, never mind.

1649
01:17:04,208 --> 01:17:09,079
I thought I saw a burglar
but it was a... turtle.

1650
01:17:10,547 --> 01:17:14,885
[suspenseful music playing]

[Dr. Lady] <i>Yoyo, where are you?</i>

1652
01:17:23,494 --> 01:17:25,162
The mosquitoes are almost there.

01:17:25,496 --> 01:17:26,196
Goodie.

1654
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:30,033
And, remember, don't keep
the steering wheel too straight.

<i>Lots of tiny movements,
left to right.</i>

[groans] I wish we wouldn't
have had these ropes.

- [grunting]
- Stop squirming.

1658
01:17:39,443 --> 01:17:42,045
Believe me this is better.
I'm supposed to kill you guys.

1659
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:44,681
What? Who said to kill us?
Edgar, what is happening?

1660
01:17:44,715 --> 01:17:47,451
- Ow! Our bracelets are sharp.
- These bracelets really hurt.

1661
01:17:47,484 --> 01:17:49,486
- They're sharp. I know.
- They're sharp, be careful

1662
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,688
with that. And we... [groans]

1663
01:17:51,722 --> 01:17:54,391
Edgar, you lied to me!

1664
01:17:54,425 --> 01:17:57,461
You should talk.
I know all about the HPV.

1665
01:17:58,763 --> 01:18:00,597
Okay. Look, I was gonna
tell you about that.

1666
01:18:00,631 --> 01:18:03,200
A lot of people have it.
I mean, you probably have it.

1667
01:18:03,233 --> 01:18:05,436
What?
Stop trying to confuse me.

1668
01:18:05,969 --> 01:18:08,539
Star, I thought
you we're different.

1669
01:18:08,572 --> 01:18:09,740
Edgar.

1670
01:18:09,774 --> 01:18:11,408
Don't let him
bamboozled you, Star.

1671
01:18:11,442 --> 01:18:12,676
He's a murderer.
Tell her.

1672
01:18:12,709 --> 01:18:15,746
- You're not who you say you are.
- You're not who you say you are.

1673
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:18,449
We are who we are.
We're Barb and Star.

1674
01:18:18,482 --> 01:18:21,552
Unlike you, Edgar,
you big effin' liar.

1675
01:18:21,585 --> 01:18:22,586
Huh?

1676
01:18:22,619 --> 01:18:24,488
God, I knew this wasn't real.

1677
01:18:24,521 --> 01:18:26,490
And no one could ever
love me again.

1678
01:18:26,523 --> 01:18:28,625
God, I'm in so much grief
right now.

1679
01:18:28,659 --> 01:18:31,395
- Goodbye, ladies.
- [Barb] Edgar, please wait.

1680
01:18:31,428 --> 01:18:33,163
A lot of innocent people
will die.

1681
01:18:33,197 --> 01:18:34,766
[Star] At least tell us why?

1682
01:18:34,799 --> 01:18:37,534
Why you would ever be involved
with such an awful thing?

1683
01:18:40,772 --> 01:18:44,308
[sighs] Fine.
I'll tell you.

1684
01:18:46,543 --> 01:18:50,147
- Oh, he pulled up a chair.
- It's gonna be a long story.

1685
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:52,282
When I was seven years old
my father

1686
01:18:52,316 --> 01:18:54,084
left my mom,
my eleven sisters, and me.

01:18:56,453 --> 01:18:58,055
so I had to support us.

1689
01:18:58,823 --> 01:19:00,357
We had no money.

1690
01:19:01,592 --> 01:19:04,461
I did odd jobs.
I built lawnmowers for Honda.

1691
01:19:04,495 --> 01:19:06,363
I even tried to sell my poop
to farmers

1692
01:19:06,396 --> 01:19:08,198
saying that it was fertilizer.

1693
01:19:09,333 --> 01:19:10,634
It was never enough.

1694
01:19:11,101 --> 01:19:13,670
One day,
a woman wearing a cape

1695
01:19:13,704 --> 01:19:16,774
and bag over her head
put $50 in my cup.

1696
01:19:18,575 --> 01:19:20,511
- Oh. Hmm.
- Oh. Mm-hmm.

1697
01:19:22,713 --> 01:19:24,081
She started to seduce me

1698
01:19:24,114 --> 01:19:25,549
as the errands
became more criminal.

1699
01:19:25,582 --> 01:19:27,551
- [grunting]
- I fell under her spell.

1700
01:19:28,051 --> 01:19:29,553
I thought it was love.

1701
01:19:32,456 --> 01:19:34,157
I would do anything for her.

1702
01:19:34,191 --> 01:19:36,393
We'd always talk
about this particular plan.

1703
01:19:36,426 --> 01:19:37,528
Her life's work.

1704
01:19:38,195 --> 01:19:40,063
When it came time to help her,
I said, Yes.

1705
01:19:40,330 --> 01:19:41,799
Of course,
I had my reservations,

1706
01:19:41,833 --> 01:19:43,066
but...

1707
01:19:43,868 --> 01:19:47,504
But she said when it was over,
we could be an official couple.

1708
01:19:47,538 --> 01:19:50,574
That's all I wanted at the time.
That's all I've ever wanted.

1709
01:19:51,742 --> 01:19:53,443
People do crazy things for love.

1710
01:19:54,311 --> 01:19:56,613
Yeah, but, I mean,
killing people, that's...

1711
01:19:56,647 --> 01:19:57,581
that's a lot.

1712
01:19:57,916 --> 01:20:01,084
Yeah, it's a lot of people.
That's... that's a little crazy.

1713
01:20:01,118 --> 01:20:03,453
Is it? Wouldn't you
have done it for Carmine?

1714
01:20:05,455 --> 01:20:06,690
And you for Ron?

1715
01:20:09,226 --> 01:20:10,427
Wait.

1716
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:13,096
How do you know about Barb's
dead husband, Ron Quicksilver?

1717
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:14,665
- Wait.
- She told me

1718
01:20:14,698 --> 01:20:15,800
- when she came to see me.
- Oh.

1719
01:20:15,833 --> 01:20:18,135
That night on the foot bridge
right before you did.

1720
01:20:18,168 --> 01:20:20,270
Well, you weren't supposed
to say that.

1721
01:20:20,671 --> 01:20:23,674
Goodbye, Barb and Star.
Whoever you are.

1722
01:20:27,244 --> 01:20:30,280
Okay. We can talk about it.
Let's just talk about it.

1723
01:20:30,314 --> 01:20:32,549
It's... It was a long time ago.
A long time.

1724
01:20:33,083 --> 01:20:35,319
[MC]
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome

1725
01:20:35,352 --> 01:20:38,155
to the 49th Annual Seafood Jam,

1726
01:20:38,689 --> 01:20:40,424
where the clams are hot

1727
01:20:40,457 --> 01:20:42,894
and the crowd
is on the older side.

1728
01:20:42,927 --> 01:20:44,862
[indistinct chatter]

1729
01:20:46,296 --> 01:20:47,531
People are gonna die!

1730
01:20:47,564 --> 01:20:49,266
- We have to find Edgar!
- You're right,

1731
01:20:49,299 --> 01:20:51,501
but by me agreeing with you
about having to stop Edgar,

1732
01:20:51,535 --> 01:20:53,403
I don't agree about
stopping being mad at you.

1733
01:20:53,437 --> 01:20:55,372
We agree to go.
But I want you to know

1734
01:20:55,405 --> 01:20:56,908
that I'm frustrated and hurt

1735
01:20:56,941 --> 01:20:58,642
and I'm really
freaking pissed off.

1736
01:20:58,675 --> 01:21:00,878
I'm freaking pissed off too.
It's not that I'm copying you

1737
01:21:00,912 --> 01:21:02,212
- It's because I am.
- Fine.

1738
01:21:06,583 --> 01:21:07,751
Hello.

1739
01:21:07,785 --> 01:21:08,820
[both] Hi.

1740
01:21:12,623 --> 01:21:14,558
[dramatic music playing]

1741
01:21:16,326 --> 01:21:17,862
[seagulls calling]

1742
01:21:23,634 --> 01:21:24,802
[both gasp]

1743
01:21:26,838 --> 01:21:29,172
- [Dr. Lady] Oh, hello.
- [both gasp]

1744
01:21:29,539 --> 01:21:31,475
Enjoying your vacation?

1745
01:21:32,609 --> 01:21:33,710
- Well, um...
- Oh, um...

1746
01:21:33,744 --> 01:21:36,480
- It started out fine.
- ...supposed to be a friend trip

1747
01:21:36,513 --> 01:21:38,215
- We got here and we were...
- And we got here.

1748
01:21:38,248 --> 01:21:39,650
- No, I didn't...
- [Barb overlapping]

1749
01:21:39,683 --> 01:21:41,953
The first night, we went out
to loosen up a little bit.

1750
01:21:41,986 --> 01:21:44,688
That's when we meet Edgar,
which was not a good idea.

1751
01:21:44,721 --> 01:21:47,290
Edgar and I started hanging out,
and I was lying to Barb,

1752
01:21:47,324 --> 01:21:49,259
- which I shouldn't have done...
- I met Tommy Bahama.

1753
01:21:49,292 --> 01:21:51,228
- You met Tommy Bahama? Anyway...
- Then we discovered...

1754
01:21:51,261 --> 01:21:52,063
Enough!

1755
01:21:52,396 --> 01:21:56,466
I have set up one last excursion
for the two of you.

1756
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:58,735
[snickers]
It's more of a game, really.

1757
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:04,241
The rules are
you get to choose how you die.

1758
01:22:04,274 --> 01:22:05,375
- What?
- What?

1759
01:22:05,709 --> 01:22:07,544
You can either
jump off that cliff behind you

1760
01:22:07,577 --> 01:22:09,781
hitting every sharp rock
on the way down,

1761
01:22:09,814 --> 01:22:11,648
ripping your skin
at every bounce

1762
01:22:11,682 --> 01:22:14,685
or you can stay here
and have dinner

1763
01:22:15,352 --> 01:22:18,890
with, um... my new friends.

1764
01:22:18,923 --> 01:22:20,524
- [growling]
- There are two

1765
01:22:20,758 --> 01:22:24,494
very hungry hot alligators
in those crates.

1766
01:22:24,528 --> 01:22:25,696
[both] Alligators?

1767
01:22:25,729 --> 01:22:27,364
- Oh, please. No, no...
- No, no, no...

1768
01:22:27,397 --> 01:22:30,734
That's what you get
for getting in my way.

1769
01:22:31,535 --> 01:22:36,339
Now, you can kiss your
middle-aged, flat, wide asses...

1770
01:22:36,941 --> 01:22:37,842
[both gasp]

1771
01:22:39,643 --> 01:22:40,778
...goodbye.

1772
01:22:40,812 --> 01:22:41,913
- Please wait!
- Oh, my gosh!

1773
01:22:42,113 --> 01:22:44,281
[Star] No, no, no, no, no, no.

1774
01:22:46,818 --> 01:22:48,986
Thanks a lot, Star, for making
me come on this trip.

1775
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:50,788
Now, we're gonna die
just like I predicted.

1776
01:22:50,822 --> 01:22:52,790
Oh, will you just stop
your complaining for once?

1777
01:22:52,824 --> 01:22:54,291
Seems to me like you've been
having the time

1778
01:22:54,324 --> 01:22:55,960
- of your life here.
- Oh, I sure have.

1779
01:22:55,993 --> 01:22:58,930
- [growling]
- [both whimpering]

1780
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:02,566
[suspenseful music playing]

1781
01:23:10,707 --> 01:23:12,810
When we get to heaven, we're not
living with each other,

1782
01:23:12,844 --> 01:23:14,644
and we're not running around
playing harps

1783
01:23:14,678 --> 01:23:15,412
in our halos and wings!

1784
01:23:15,913 --> 01:23:18,615
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm not even
gonna look for you up there!

1785
01:23:18,648 --> 01:23:20,650
I'm gonna find the farthest
cloud away from you.

1786
01:23:20,684 --> 01:23:22,419
And I'm gonna find Betsy Ross!

1787
01:23:22,452 --> 01:23:24,354
And I'm gonna be
best friends with her.

1788
01:23:24,387 --> 01:23:26,523
And we're gonna ignore you
at all the parties.

1789
01:23:27,859 --> 01:23:29,894
[whimpering]

1790
01:23:31,361 --> 01:23:33,363
I guess we're gonna die
on bad terms.

1791
01:23:33,396 --> 01:23:34,631
I guess you're right.

1792
01:23:35,465 --> 01:23:37,835
[dramatic music playing]

1793
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:44,741
[screaming]

1794
01:23:47,744 --> 01:23:49,013
[parachute flapping]

1795
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:52,516
[dramatic music playing]

1796
01:23:54,551 --> 01:23:56,686
- Our culottes!
- They're natural parachutes.

1797
01:24:09,499 --> 01:24:11,601
[gasping]

1798
01:24:13,737 --> 01:24:15,472
I'm so sorry. Oh!

1799
01:24:15,505 --> 01:24:17,440
So sorry. Lying to you
was the hardest thing

1800
01:24:17,474 --> 01:24:18,608
I've ever had to do.

1801
01:24:18,642 --> 01:24:20,443
- I'm sorry too.
- No. This is all my fault.

1802
01:24:20,477 --> 01:24:21,979
None of this will be happening
if I hadn't suggested

1803
01:24:22,013 --> 01:24:23,713
coming on this trip
in the first place.

1804
01:24:23,747 --> 01:24:26,017
Are you kidding? I've had
the time of my life here.

1805
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:27,819
I've done things
I never thought I would do.

1806
01:24:27,852 --> 01:24:29,821
- I went in the ocean, Star.
- [gasps]

1807
01:24:29,854 --> 01:24:31,989
- And I got my labia pierced.
- What?

1808
01:24:32,023 --> 01:24:34,357
I took it out.
Immediately took it out.

1809
01:24:34,391 --> 01:24:36,426
I should never have spent
all that time with Edgar

1810
01:24:36,459 --> 01:24:38,095
behind your back.
I should've told you.

1811
01:24:38,129 --> 01:24:40,730
I know you're only
trying to protect my feelings.

1812
01:24:40,765 --> 01:24:42,499
And I'm so happy you found love.

1813
01:24:42,532 --> 01:24:43,901
[giggling]

1814
01:24:44,836 --> 01:24:47,637
I mean, it's unfortunate that
he turned out to be a conman

1815
01:24:47,671 --> 01:24:50,373
- and a mass murderer.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1816
01:24:50,407 --> 01:24:51,508
[both gasp]

1817
01:24:51,541 --> 01:24:52,609
- Oh, my God.
- [Star] Edgar.

1818
01:24:52,642 --> 01:24:54,411
- [both] We have to stop him.
- Go!

1819
01:24:55,279 --> 01:24:58,448
[MC] The Seafood Jam
just keeps on jamming!

1820
01:24:58,916 --> 01:25:00,084
[Dr. Lady] Nice view.

1821
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:04,554
- [slurping]
- What are you doing here?

1822
01:25:05,655 --> 01:25:07,058
Cleaning up your mess.

1823
01:25:07,091 --> 01:25:08,725
Seems like
you can't follow through

1824
01:25:08,759 --> 01:25:10,761
with anything these days.
For example,

1825
01:25:10,795 --> 01:25:12,830
getting rid
of your little friends.

1826
01:25:14,531 --> 01:25:17,667
- I did. I-I mean, I...
- Oh, it's okay, Edgar.

1827
01:25:17,701 --> 01:25:20,137
I took care of them myself.

1828
01:25:20,171 --> 01:25:21,072
What?

1829
01:25:21,538 --> 01:25:23,740
- What did you do?
- Let's just say

1830
01:25:23,774 --> 01:25:26,010
there are a couple
of alligators out there

1831
01:25:26,043 --> 01:25:29,512
with bellies full of... them.

1832
01:25:30,513 --> 01:25:33,550
Oh, don't be so sad, Edgar.

1833
01:25:33,583 --> 01:25:36,720
Those two were just a couple
of pathetic Stellas

1834
01:25:36,753 --> 01:25:38,588
trying to get their groove back.

1835
01:25:39,056 --> 01:25:40,624
But they were spies, right?

1836
01:25:41,359 --> 01:25:44,028
I mean, you told me
that they were spies.

1837
01:25:44,061 --> 01:25:46,696
Sorry. I just said that
to get what I want.

1838
01:25:47,198 --> 01:25:48,799
Sometimes I do that,

1839
01:25:48,833 --> 01:25:52,469
but I'll work on it

Look, I'm sorry.

01:27:33,204 --> 01:27:35,873
She told me you were spies.
That's why I tied you up.

1880
01:27:35,906 --> 01:27:38,909
She's manipulated me
this whole time.

1881

- Because...

and drive inland
as fast as you can, okay?

1891
01:28:05,136 --> 01:28:07,104
I'm gonna get in the boat
and dump the receiver

1892

far out in the ocean, okay?

1893

You don't have
to worry about me.

Look, I have the antidote.

I have to go through with it.
