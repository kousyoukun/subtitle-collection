1
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:30,200
印第安納波利斯號：勇者無懼

2
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,400
(沖繩 1945年3月31日)

3
00:00:45,673 --> 00:00:46,952
開火！　開火！

4
00:00:53,315 --> 00:00:54,813
十一點鐘方向！
十一點鐘方向！

5
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,393
開火！　開火！

6
00:01:04,526 --> 00:01:05,796
戰鬥機攻擊艦頭！

7
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:12,737
十二點鐘方向！
十二點鐘方向！

8
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:14,137
開火！　開火！

9
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:18,542
準備迎接撞擊！
準備迎接撞擊！

10
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:25,379
損傷報告！損傷報告！

11
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:27,848
救火隊快去艦頭！救火隊快去艦頭！

12
00:01:27,884 --> 00:01:29,188
馬上報告受損情況！

13
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:49,203
日本鬼子偷襲珍珠港
給了我們沉重一擊

14
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,506
我們必須強硬起來，予以反擊

15
00:01:51,542 --> 00:01:53,741
對他們不能有任何同情

16
00:01:53,778 --> 00:01:56,545
要以牙還牙
目標在硫磺島，沖繩島

17
00:01:56,582 --> 00:01:58,013
要採取什麼樣的方式？

18
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,615
內地攻擊，只會更加拖延戰爭時間

19
00:02:00,852 --> 00:02:02,852
杜魯門身為總統三個月了

20
00:02:02,988 --> 00:02:04,854
和諧蜜月期即將結束

21
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:08,258
美國希望這場戰爭趕快結束

22
00:02:08,494 --> 00:02:11,192
天啊，你的意思是動用原子彈？

23
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,128
如此才能一針見血，直擊要害

24
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:16,333
把炸彈投到廣島的軍事基地

25
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,399
從表面上看來是可行的

26
00:02:18,436 --> 00:02:21,437
但如此做會殺死了所有人
包含女人小孩

27
00:02:21,473 --> 00:02:23,440
更不用說輻射外洩的問題

28
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,672
若是原子彈爆炸

29
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:26,342
關於輻射，我們根本保證不了

30
00:02:26,378 --> 00:02:27,911
明目張膽飛到日本空投
是行不通的

31
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:32,415
我們用氣艇把炸彈
運到菲律賓海的天寧島

32
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:33,617
恕我直言

33
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,417
我們知道日本海軍防線很薄弱

34
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:36,886
但派一支艦隊太招搖了
日本會發現

35
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,722
不是一支艦隊，也沒有護航

36
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,993
只是一艘戰艦，快速移動的戰艦

37
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,361
單獨前往，沒有保護

38
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,734
這簡直是自殺任務

39
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,935
但是如果成功…

40
00:02:50,972 --> 00:02:52,908
他們將會永垂青史

41
00:02:56,575 --> 00:02:58,341
你有理想的人選嗎？

42
00:02:58,377 --> 00:03:01,478
戰事頻起

43
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:05,549
直到我們把同類趕盡殺絕

44
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,286
我們和亡命殺徒的區別在於

45
00:03:07,322 --> 00:03:10,454
我們會盡全力執行任務，然後回家

46
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:13,859
那位開著神風戰鬥機
迎頭撞向我們艦頭的人

47
00:03:13,896 --> 00:03:16,427
他清楚知道再也回不了家

48
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:19,031
他執行的是自殺任務

49
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:22,901
用自己的身體當作武器

50
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:26,471
當面對這樣的敵人時
願上帝保佑我們

51
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:33,045
再過幾天就是我的生日

52
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:37,783
再見你一面就是我最好的禮物

53
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,718
我親愛的路易絲

54
00:03:39,755 --> 00:03:41,054
是的

55
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,490
保羅？
是的，長官

56
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,759
你可以把這電報
送到西聯匯款電報公司嗎？

57
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:49,064
遵命，長官

58
00:04:00,662 --> 00:04:02,642
(加州納帕山谷 1945年4月)

59
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:04,478
從你國小四年級開始
就對這個女孩有意思！

60
00:04:04,515 --> 00:04:07,046
但是到現在你都還沒約她出來過？

61
00:04:07,082 --> 00:04:08,681
你不會明白的

62
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:10,818
像她那種久經事故的富家女

63
00:04:10,855 --> 00:04:12,854
你無法體驗我的感受的

64
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,556
你必須向她證明自己

65
00:04:14,592 --> 00:04:16,423
所以我才會這麼努力地想要晉陞…

66
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,424
什麼，所以你沒得到晉陞
她就不會喜歡你？

67
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:19,828
當你忙著籌策規劃時

68
00:04:19,864 --> 00:04:21,562
你知道未來會發生什麼事嗎？

69
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:26,033
人生，要活在當下，我的朋友

70
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,470
天啊！

71
00:04:28,507 --> 00:04:30,475
她老爸真有錢！

72
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:38,581
布萊恩·史密斯威克

73
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:40,849
貝茲摩爾法官
你好，先生？

74
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:42,717
這是我的朋友，麥克

75
00:04:42,754 --> 00:04:44,519
您家真的好豪華

76
00:04:44,556 --> 00:04:46,522
我一直跟我的兄弟巴馬說
就像那部電影裏的豪宅

77
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:49,457
有句台詞是「老實說，親愛的，我一點也不在乎」
(語出︰亂世佳人)

78
00:04:49,493 --> 00:04:51,093
哦，想不起來就算了
我是麥克·德安東尼歐

79
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:52,560
很高興見到你

80
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:54,096
他來自紐約，先生

81
00:04:54,132 --> 00:04:56,132
布萊恩，可以到我的辦公室嗎？

82
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:58,167
紳士們想認識你

83
00:04:58,203 --> 00:05:00,604
阿隆索，帶麥克到樓上客廳

84
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,806
同時告訴那些女孩
把音樂關小聲點

85
00:05:06,511 --> 00:05:10,513
布萊恩，我們終於要攻打日本
這是真的嗎？

86
00:05:10,549 --> 00:05:12,715
嗯，是傳聞有一段時間了，先生

87
00:05:12,752 --> 00:05:14,518
他們不會透漏太多內幕的

88
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:17,020
我聽說我們重創了日本帝國海軍

89
00:05:17,056 --> 00:05:18,854
嗯…

90
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:23,461
我們印第安納波利斯號的主力戰將

91
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:24,896
久仰其名！

92
00:05:24,932 --> 00:05:27,030
你認為戰爭會持續打下去嗎，帥哥？

93
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:28,833
我真的不知道，先生

94
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:30,435
你有兒子在軍隊裏嗎？

95
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:33,035
沒有，我兒子靠鋼鐵賺了很多錢

96
00:05:33,072 --> 00:05:34,971
沒錯，戰爭有利於企業

97
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:36,641
而企業有利於美國

98
00:05:36,678 --> 00:05:39,610
我們為你感到驕傲，帥哥
謝謝你，先生

99
00:05:39,646 --> 00:05:42,512
五，六，七，八

100
00:05:42,548 --> 00:05:44,051
你們準備好了？

101
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:54,193
老兄，可以過來幫忙嗎？

102
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,727
不，不，你繼續出醜吧！

103
00:05:56,763 --> 00:05:57,999
我在這裏看就好了

104
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:05,671
您的朋友正在教舞蹈社團的女孩

105
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,738
跳著紐約最新的熱舞

106
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,946
帥吧？

107
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,486
喔！

108
00:06:19,687 --> 00:06:21,820
他真是有趣

109
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,399
(舊金山 1945年7月15日)

110
00:07:14,345 --> 00:07:16,311
聽著，你們要拿出勞斯萊斯的水準

111
00:07:16,347 --> 00:07:18,746
來修這艘戰艦，明白嗎？

112
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,316
她可是海軍的掌上明珠！

113
00:07:21,352 --> 00:07:23,251
幹的好，幹的好

114
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:26,588
好，必須把這戰艦修得跟新的一樣！

115
00:07:26,624 --> 00:07:28,623
讓日本鬼子知道
他們的攻擊在我們眼裏不算什麼！

116
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,759
我們才不怕他們，明白嗎？

117
00:07:29,795 --> 00:07:31,593
幹得好，水手！

118
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,696
我的鞋不准破洞
我的戰艦不准任何破洞！

119
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:38,067
嘿，這需要兩個醫生花六小時

120
00:07:38,103 --> 00:07:40,002
從你的屁眼拉出我的十號靴子

121
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:41,904
如果你再不快一點的話
新兵 FNG(Fucking New Guy)

122
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,239
你是說「該死的新兵」！

123
00:07:43,275 --> 00:07:45,307
長官！繼續

124
00:07:45,344 --> 00:07:47,777
恭喜你，麥克沃特，我有聽到消息

125
00:07:47,813 --> 00:07:49,679
是男孩嗎？迫不及待地想見到他

126
00:07:49,715 --> 00:07:52,014
是個體重九磅十三盎司
出生時活蹦亂跳

127
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:53,249
我妻子情況也很好

128
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:55,318
太棒了，戰艦修復的狀況如何？

129
00:07:55,354 --> 00:07:57,186
日本飛機在船上炸了一個大洞

130
00:07:57,223 --> 00:07:59,226
但沒有傷到大炮，長官

131
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:06,762
長官？
斯坦迪遜中尉前來報到，長官

132
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:07,997
準備把這些水手們

133
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:11,603
訓練成驍勇善戰的戰鬥機器

134
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,606
順帶一提，我的父親
珀西·斯坦迪遜上將

135
00:08:14,642 --> 00:08:17,045
向您問好

136
00:08:19,113 --> 00:08:23,118
所有船員做好準備
所有船員做好準備

137
00:08:43,872 --> 00:08:45,637
看起來你們對戰艦進行的修復工作

138
00:08:45,673 --> 00:08:47,205
進度非常快
是的長官

139
00:08:47,242 --> 00:08:48,706
我們今天就能修復完畢

140
00:08:48,742 --> 00:08:51,243
那場戰役上
你們只有九名士兵陣亡

141
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,378
對你及弟兄們是個很好的交代

142
00:08:53,415 --> 00:08:55,147
九名太多了

143
00:08:55,183 --> 00:08:57,850
準備走出陰霾了嗎，上校？

144
00:08:57,886 --> 00:09:00,084
海軍上將，我有九名新進軍官

145
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:02,186
和兩百五十名新士兵

146
00:09:02,223 --> 00:09:05,027
但我們會盡快完成戰艦健康檢查
而且做好出海準備的

147
00:09:08,997 --> 00:09:12,064
這邊，這邊

148
00:09:12,101 --> 00:09:16,002
上校，杜魯門總統決定任命你

149
00:09:16,038 --> 00:09:18,837
來領導執行一個高度機密的任務

150
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:20,810
這不是一個戰鬥任務

151
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:26,146
你要運送兩件高度機密的貨物

152
00:09:26,182 --> 00:09:27,913
以最快的速度前往天寧島

153
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,317
途中只能在珍珠港停靠加油

154
00:09:30,353 --> 00:09:32,753
你明天出發

155
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:35,155
我們在哪裏和護航艦會合？

156
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:39,863
查理，這項任務
可以挽救數百萬美國人的生命

157
00:09:41,264 --> 00:09:43,063
這是最高機密的

158
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,070
所以沒有護航艦

159
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:53,945
這任務是否與曼哈頓計劃有關？

160
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:04,118
明天你戰艦起航後，再打開它

161
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:05,921
明天早上五點之後

162
00:10:05,957 --> 00:10:07,856
這艘戰艦將由美國總統

163
00:10:07,892 --> 00:10:09,461
全權指揮

164
00:10:11,764 --> 00:10:13,195
祝你好運，上校

165
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,443
滾開我的座位

166
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:28,815
抱歉！對不起！

167
00:10:32,985 --> 00:10:35,015
你看，就是那個混蛋

168
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:36,490
一直找你麻煩

169
00:10:38,158 --> 00:10:42,126
告訴大家，你會好好教訓他的

170
00:10:42,162 --> 00:10:43,798
你打算怎麼做？

171
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,240
怎麼啦？嘿，不就是個鑽石而已

172
00:10:56,276 --> 00:10:57,775
等我有錢後，會給她買一個更大的

173
00:10:57,811 --> 00:11:00,377
這跟戒指無關

174
00:11:00,414 --> 00:11:02,112
我無法相信，你竟然想在法官面前

175
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:03,847
向他女兒求婚

176
00:11:03,883 --> 00:11:07,917
你想好了嗎？你才認識她三個月

177
00:11:07,954 --> 00:11:09,854
我以為你們只是玩一玩而已

178
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,956
哦，是啊
我們在一起確實非常快樂

179
00:11:12,993 --> 00:11:16,094
此外，你憑什麼認為
我會怕一個法官？

180
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,263
你連試都沒試…

181
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:21,398
就鐵定不會成功的，我知道

182
00:11:31,512 --> 00:11:34,947
別忘了稱呼他們
「先生」和「夫人」，好嗎？

183
00:11:34,983 --> 00:11:38,053
嘿，我要讓你當我的伴郎

184
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:52,298
我的媽啊，大飽眼福羅

185
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:54,399
你沒機會了，沒機會了

186
00:11:54,436 --> 00:11:56,203
要連進兩球，不然你輸定了！

187
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,904
我告訴你，你根本無法知道

188
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,839
神風戰鬥機會從何處撞過來
你知道嗎？

189
00:11:59,876 --> 00:12:01,241
而我是負責開火的，明白嗎？
我就像…

190
00:12:02,277 --> 00:12:03,944
戰機來啦…

191
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,545
辣爆了，桑切斯，你他媽太屌了！

192
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:13,252
把你的馬牽好！
我來了！我來了！

193
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:16,590
下一輪換你啦！

194
00:12:16,627 --> 00:12:19,560
年輕的小伙子，如果不喝掛一次

195
00:12:19,596 --> 00:12:22,062
他怎麼會知道自己可以喝多少呢？

196
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:24,531
現在是1945年

197
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:27,535
我們的戰艦停靠在舊金山進行維修

198
00:12:27,571 --> 00:12:30,637
街上喧騰熱鬧，而且水手們…

199
00:12:30,673 --> 00:12:33,207
今晚進城逍遙去

200
00:12:33,244 --> 00:12:37,011
德安東尼歐！我爸不是那個意思！

201
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,380
是啊，但聽起來就是，克萊拉！

202
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:42,120
求求你，等我！

203
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:46,925
麥克！

204
00:12:48,326 --> 00:12:50,157
德安東尼歐！
幹嘛？

205
00:12:50,194 --> 00:12:52,493
你可以停下來聽我解釋嗎？
我有在聽！

206
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:55,330
你需要給我爸一個機會！
他只是需要一些時間想想！

207
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:57,965
所以，我猜你從來沒有告訴過你的父母
你在跟窮小子交往

208
00:12:58,002 --> 00:12:59,234
不是這樣的

209
00:12:59,271 --> 00:13:01,302
他們的表情就說明了一切！

210
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:06,075
爭強好勝的紅衣年輕女子
正在糾纏一位水手…

211
00:13:06,111 --> 00:13:09,077
而另一位水手…

212
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:11,113
似乎在追求紅衣女子

213
00:13:14,686 --> 00:13:17,519
快點！快點！

214
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:23,259
伙食房的打雜竟然會拳擊喔！

215
00:13:23,296 --> 00:13:25,261
他們在打架！
嘿，各位，他們在打架！

216
00:13:25,297 --> 00:13:26,663
這不公平，你不能以此威脅我！

217
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,964
德安東尼歐！
德安東尼歐！有人在打架

218
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:29,265
有人在打架！有人在打架！

219
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:31,234
待在這兒！

220
00:13:31,271 --> 00:13:32,535
待在這兒！麥克！

221
00:13:37,344 --> 00:13:38,912
給他點顏色瞧瞧

222
00:13:42,148 --> 00:13:44,615
你們哪一位想先上來挨刀子？

223
00:13:44,652 --> 00:13:48,218
你真的要玩刀子嗎？
我受寵若驚！

224
00:13:48,254 --> 00:13:50,387
三對五！
旁邊的朋友過來湊合才公平

225
00:13:50,423 --> 00:13:51,688
加裏森，別鬧了！

226
00:13:51,725 --> 00:13:53,624
閉嘴！閉嘴！奎因！

227
00:13:53,661 --> 00:13:55,727
後退，夥伴！

228
00:13:55,763 --> 00:13:59,030
我說，後退！

229
00:13:59,067 --> 00:14:01,131
好啦

230
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:02,567
公平對決

231
00:14:02,604 --> 00:14:04,169
你我單挑

232
00:14:04,205 --> 00:14:06,570
你哪知道什麼叫做公平！

233
00:14:06,607 --> 00:14:09,573
你現在不是在船上，屌蛋！

234
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:13,512
如果他們亂動，就砍他們！
如果你們不做，那我就砍你們！

235
00:14:13,548 --> 00:14:15,079
爽！

236
00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:16,247
繼續，來吧！站起來！

237
00:14:22,024 --> 00:14:23,591
加裏森，這是不值得的！

238
00:14:25,693 --> 00:14:26,725
加油！

239
00:14:26,761 --> 00:14:28,261
擊倒他，老兄！

240
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:30,267
嘿！有人在下面打架！

241
00:14:37,273 --> 00:14:38,771
我賭黑鬼傢伙！
我賭黑鬼傢伙贏！

242
00:14:38,808 --> 00:14:41,541
我賭黑鬼！
撂倒他，加裏森！

243
00:14:41,577 --> 00:14:43,447
我賭黑鬼贏！

244
00:14:47,516 --> 00:14:48,547
軟腳蝦！

245
00:14:48,584 --> 00:14:50,021
閉嘴！

246
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,392
後退！後退！
耳朵長包皮啊你！

247
00:14:58,694 --> 00:15:00,531
這樣做不值得！

248
00:15:02,598 --> 00:15:04,234
擊倒他！麥克！

249
00:15:07,204 --> 00:15:08,239
擊倒他！

250
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:15,676
分開來！

251
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:19,080
停止！別打了！

252
00:15:19,117 --> 00:15:21,116
嘿，聽著，聽著！

253
00:15:21,152 --> 00:15:22,783
我的錢去你拿去哪裏…

254
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:26,153
嘿，嘿，嘿，我們剛剛接到命令？

255
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,688
上校的命令
戰艦要出發了，好嗎？

256
00:15:28,725 --> 00:15:32,259
我們得回戰艦去

257
00:15:32,296 --> 00:15:34,565
麥克！克萊拉！

258
00:15:38,469 --> 00:15:39,834
克萊拉！

259
00:15:39,871 --> 00:15:42,136
我們之間的感情是我們的事

260
00:15:42,173 --> 00:15:43,506
克萊拉，我們走吧

261
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,274
我不會像我的父親一樣

262
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,446
你是真心的？是的

263
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:51,414
德安東尼歐！

264
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,616
德安東尼歐，我們得走了！

265
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,717
快！不，不，不！

266
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,154
事情不應該是這樣的…

267
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,689
我愛你！我也愛你！

268
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:01,290
快走，水手！

269
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:04,197
克萊拉，我們走吧
我會回來的！

270
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:13,303
印第安納波利斯號的新弟兄

271
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,838
我是你們的上校

272
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:20,176
沒有我，你們是毫無價值的

273
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,844
你們是我的船員

274
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:25,282
沒有你們，我是一文不值

275
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:27,617
我們的成功

276
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,720
我們的生存…

277
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:35,392
是緊繫在我們團隊的功能運作

278
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:38,328
是一個生死互依的團體

279
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:41,199
我們要完全相信和信任

280
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:45,135
總司令的決策命令

281
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,439
明白了嗎？是的，長官！

282
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:50,246
明白了嗎？是的，長官！

283
00:17:41,497 --> 00:17:43,798
印第安納波利斯號是一艘重型巡洋艦

284
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:46,900
他的設計是用來催毀敵人的船艦和飛機

285
00:17:46,936 --> 00:17:49,803
但艦上的武器無法有效攻擊潛水艇

286
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,441
這就是為何我們需要額外的驅逐艦護航

287
00:17:53,477 --> 00:17:56,742
護航驅逐艦在我們前面充當阻滯機制

288
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:59,914
他們的工作是
發現和摧毀敵方潛水艇

289
00:17:59,951 --> 00:18:02,849
在敵方攻擊我們時
以深水炸彈消滅敵方

290
00:18:02,885 --> 00:18:05,720
很多船員都還只是嫩草

291
00:18:05,757 --> 00:18:10,291
海上是危險重重的，他們毫無概念

292
00:18:10,327 --> 00:18:12,894
如果我們被敵方潛水艇攻擊

293
00:18:12,931 --> 00:18:16,264
而且能奇蹟般地及早發現

294
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,301
在敵方魚雷到達前
我們最多會有四分鐘的時間應付或逃離

295
00:18:20,338 --> 00:18:22,570
我們主要的防禦是讓戰艦密不透水

296
00:18:22,607 --> 00:18:24,939
不讓任何船體破裂情況

297
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:26,641
嚴重擴散導致艦沉

298
00:18:26,678 --> 00:18:28,945
有關這項秘密任務
我們需在沒有護航下

299
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:32,380
以無上榮耀的郵務精神
護送兩個包裹

300
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:36,655
但任務的真正目的，我卻不能多問

301
00:18:42,761 --> 00:18:45,793
嘿，演練時
我們這組比其他組還要快七秒

302
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,465
即使沒有你，我們也都贏了

303
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:50,003
胡說八道！

304
00:18:52,438 --> 00:18:56,339
嘿，鄉巴佬，這支給你啃著玩！

305
00:18:58,544 --> 00:19:01,711
吃吧！那可是高檔貨！

306
00:19:01,747 --> 00:19:06,883
是啊，你這個混蛋

307
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,387
擔心敵人潛水艇，長官？

308
00:19:09,423 --> 00:19:11,755
看不到的東西是很難擊中的

309
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:15,559
我的建議是
戰艦可以採取Z字形航行，長官

310
00:19:15,595 --> 00:19:18,662
但對抗「回天魚雷」並不是那麼有效

311
00:19:18,698 --> 00:19:20,430
回天魚雷(Kaitens)？

312
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:24,335
是日本新的武器
一種由人操控的自殺式魚雷！

313
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,638
就像水下的神風自殺戰鬥機

314
00:19:26,674 --> 00:19:28,839
如果敵人發射回天魚雷

315
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,776
魚雷在射程中可以重新校正目標位置

316
00:19:31,812 --> 00:19:34,983
我們戰艦航速比日本潛水艇快
卻快不過回天魚雷

317
00:19:45,536 --> 00:19:50,966
1945年 7月19日
大日本帝國海軍潛水艇 I-58 於菲律賓海巡航

318
00:20:04,713 --> 00:20:08,336
他們說這潛水艇是被詛咒的

319
00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:13,028
他們不是那麼說

320
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,156
他們說我才是被詛咒的

321
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:18,555
長達四年

322
00:20:19,807 --> 00:20:20,850
無人陣亡

323
00:20:21,902 --> 00:20:25,541
是因為英靈還活著，他們才這麼說

324
00:20:26,073 --> 00:20:29,712
你相信他們有炸彈，不是嗎？

325
00:20:30,244 --> 00:20:32,840
有自己的想法是很明智的

326
00:20:33,383 --> 00:20:34,926
露出來的釘子

327
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,011
總是會挨鐵鎚打的

328
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,557
我錯過我女兒的生日

329
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,311
你有小孩嗎？

330
00:20:44,842 --> 00:20:46,396
沒有

331
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,094
長官

332
00:20:56,928 --> 00:20:58,389
我們有看到一些東西

333
00:21:05,072 --> 00:21:07,251
他又在自言自語了

334
00:21:18,628 --> 00:21:19,456
準備發射回天魚雷

335
00:21:19,556 --> 00:21:19,670
準備發射回天魚雷

336
00:21:43,237 --> 00:21:44,790
希望你成功

337
00:21:48,972 --> 00:21:50,004
登上回天魚雷一號

338
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,496
全艦進入戰備狀態

339
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,534
傳上去，快！

340
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,441
動作快！

341
00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:12,945
準備

342
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:40,275
方位向右三十度

343
00:22:40,588 --> 00:22:42,454
距離八千公尺

344
00:22:42,673 --> 00:22:44,227
方位向右三十度

345
00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:46,104
距離八千公尺

346
00:22:46,219 --> 00:22:48,398
十二分鐘到達目標

347
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,049
最後你有什麼想說的

348
00:22:54,144 --> 00:22:56,740
最後你有什麼想說的

349
00:22:59,357 --> 00:23:02,580
他說，「衷心感謝」

350
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:06,333
發射

351
00:23:06,438 --> 00:23:07,220
發射

352
00:23:21,217 --> 00:23:23,050
就戰鬥位置！
就戰鬥位置！

353
00:23:26,189 --> 00:23:28,025
快點！快點！

354
00:23:34,764 --> 00:23:36,063
裝彈

355
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,932
快點！快點！

356
00:23:37,969 --> 00:23:39,604
戰鬥人員就定位！

357
00:23:41,872 --> 00:23:43,837
準備！

358
00:23:43,874 --> 00:23:44,906
往下！

359
00:23:44,942 --> 00:23:46,776
炮彈！炮彈！

360
00:23:46,812 --> 00:23:49,009
好！準備！

361
00:23:49,046 --> 00:23:50,880
發射！發射！發射！

362
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:53,019
發射！發射！發射！發射！快點！

363
00:24:06,094 --> 00:24:08,690
那只是一艘貨艦，沒擊中！

364
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,174
他光榮陣亡

365
00:24:13,393 --> 00:24:14,947
我會告訴他的家人

366
00:24:15,874 --> 00:24:17,940
完畢！

367
00:24:17,977 --> 00:24:19,875
W組的夥伴可以休息了

368
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:21,777
我想讓重炮組在全暗情況下
再演練一次

369
00:24:21,813 --> 00:24:23,180
W組的夥伴，演練結束

370
00:24:23,217 --> 00:24:25,681
把五，六，七區的電源關掉

371
00:24:25,717 --> 00:24:29,318
我們成功了！

372
00:24:29,354 --> 00:24:30,820
再做一次演練

373
00:24:30,857 --> 00:24:32,824
好的

374
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,727
好吧！軟殼兵們
上校要我們再做一次演練

375
00:24:35,763 --> 00:24:36,764
不會吧！

376
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,715
拖完一遍後，再拖一遍！

377
00:24:58,752 --> 00:25:02,053
如果我看見你們兩個…嘿！

378
00:25:02,089 --> 00:25:04,923
拜託，你們真是蠢到爆

379
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:06,759
怎麼連拖個地都不會

380
00:25:06,795 --> 00:25:08,893
哪一個是給斯坦迪遜的？

381
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,230
是這一份嗎？
不，不，不，這是麥克維的

382
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:13,365
太好啦

383
00:25:13,401 --> 00:25:15,200
歐~拜託

384
00:25:15,237 --> 00:25:18,107
你很噁心

385
00:25:23,412 --> 00:25:25,944
奎因，你在做什麼？

386
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,381
做好事
你加太多了，他喝得出來的

387
00:25:29,418 --> 00:25:31,288
希望他喜歡這特製的餡餅

388
00:25:34,191 --> 00:25:35,221
上校

389
00:25:35,257 --> 00:25:36,889
今天你武器演練做得不錯

390
00:25:36,926 --> 00:25:38,894
謝謝你，長官

391
00:25:40,796 --> 00:25:46,465
你在這個美味的餡餅放了什麼
希歐多爾？

392
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:48,768
這恐怕是機密資訊，長官

393
00:25:48,805 --> 00:25:51,004
放下吧，蠢蛋

394
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,242
是的

395
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:02,153
是不是太燙了，長官？

396
00:26:05,254 --> 00:26:07,454
重炮組花費四十二秒，長官

397
00:26:07,491 --> 00:26:10,192
全暗情況下花費四分三十六秒

398
00:26:10,228 --> 00:26:12,259
需不需要再演練一次？不用了！

399
00:26:12,296 --> 00:26:14,328
全速前進

400
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:17,465
全速前進，班迪克斯

401
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:20,368
她的美色在港口頂多四分
要是到了船上，絕對有十分！

402
00:26:20,404 --> 00:26:22,937
我今天右手割傷，算你們走運

403
00:26:22,974 --> 00:26:24,238
怎們弄傷的？換衛生棉條時？

404
00:26:24,274 --> 00:26:26,140
是啊，起笑吧，傻逼！

405
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,909
好吧，我欠豆斯七十五元

406
00:26:28,946 --> 00:26:31,346
然後欠桑切斯五十元

407
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:33,185
欠奎因二十五元

408
00:26:36,021 --> 00:26:37,918
雪特！

409
00:26:37,955 --> 00:26:40,822
在我們卸完貨後
有人知道我們要去哪裏？

410
00:26:40,858 --> 00:26:42,824
好吧，豬頭，誰拿走我的包包

411
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,494
沒有人拿你的包包，你這蠢蛋

412
00:26:44,531 --> 00:26:49,069
你這亮晶晶的魔鬼
真的值八百五十元？

413
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:53,902
A - R - T

414
00:26:53,938 --> 00:26:56,974
長官？卸完貨後，我們要去哪裏？

415
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:00,446
這不關我的事，也不關你的事

416
00:27:06,552 --> 00:27:08,151
貨箱裏裝什麼東西？

417
00:27:08,188 --> 00:27:12,022
我聽說是麥克阿瑟將軍的衛生紙

418
00:27:15,995 --> 00:27:18,829
你為什麼要加入海軍陸戰隊？

419
00:27:18,865 --> 00:27:20,501
為了殺人

420
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,508
您要的麥片，大副

421
00:27:31,544 --> 00:27:34,577
嘿，林迪想要告白

422
00:27:34,614 --> 00:27:37,448
這混蛋本來想加入陸軍

423
00:27:37,485 --> 00:27:41,885
但是最後被派到海軍
他卻不會游泳

424
00:27:41,922 --> 00:27:43,888
我告訴他，其實不需要

425
00:27:43,925 --> 00:27:45,457
會游泳

426
00:27:45,493 --> 00:27:48,026
因為我們戰艦不會沉吧，長官？

427
00:27:48,062 --> 00:27:51,161
老弟，你知道這艘戰艦有幾年了？

428
00:27:51,198 --> 00:27:53,932
十三年了
十三是一個不吉祥的數字

429
00:27:53,969 --> 00:28:03,475
我們仗著不吉祥的特權
運送這只有天曉得，卻沒人護航的包裹遠渡重洋

430
00:28:03,512 --> 00:28:06,911
你根本不需要會游泳
一旦你掉進海裏

431
00:28:06,948 --> 00:28:12,384
即使日本鬼子沒有逮到你…
在海裏，還有鯊魚等著你

432
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,353
鯊魚？

433
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,354
是的，大白鯊

434
00:28:16,391 --> 00:28:19,326
鯊魚處於食物鏈的最頂端
沒什麼天敵

435
00:28:19,363 --> 00:28:21,995
是從恐龍時代遺留下來的古老殺手鑭

436
00:28:22,031 --> 00:28:24,297
那時在海裏，還有取之不盡的食物

437
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,999
你們這些傢伙繼續幹活

438
00:28:26,035 --> 00:28:29,068
我們的祖先從海裏走上陸地
經由進化演變

439
00:28:29,104 --> 00:28:33,607
我們有了這進化的大腦
發明了武器

440
00:28:33,643 --> 00:28:36,410
所以我們很自然地登上食物鏈的頂端

441
00:28:36,446 --> 00:28:39,912
一旦我們踏進海洋這塊區域

442
00:28:39,949 --> 00:28:42,915
就馬上變成食物鏈的最下層

443
00:28:42,952 --> 00:28:47,121
即使你泳技再好
在鯊魚眼中你還是小蝦米

444
00:28:47,157 --> 00:28:51,491
鯊魚會把我們撕裂，從中間咬斷
你知道嗎？

445
00:28:51,527 --> 00:28:55,496
五排匕首般的牙齒，強而有力的下顎

446
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:59,933
可以弄彎鋼材

447
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:03,171
沒關係！
人肉咸咸，我們也不太好吃

448
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:05,173
但是當鯊魚把我們撕成碎片後

449
00:29:05,209 --> 00:29:06,974
我們的血流的到處都是

450
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,477
要知道，沒有什麼會讓鯊魚興奮

451
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,016
除了血…

452
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:15,082
抱歉！是啊

453
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:17,019
我奉命被派到輪機艙做沖壓員

454
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,587
執行官奉命你來的？
是的，大副

455
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:21,255
是嗎？你們看他漂亮的鼻子

456
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,662
這漂亮的鼻子！你看！

457
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,630
你該感到慶幸
我沒往你的鼻子上來一拳！

458
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,331
是的，大副

459
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:32,668
其實我一點也不擔心

460
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:34,937
只要有只和平鴿在這裏

461
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:36,472
我們好運就不會用光

462
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:39,207
她是我們的好運護身符
好了，回去工作！

463
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:41,109
上校要求全速度航行

464
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:43,245
大副，和平鴿尾羽要更長一點的

465
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,981
這是一隻野鴿子

466
00:29:45,018 --> 00:29:46,953
我的父親有飼養鴿子
所以我知道

467
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:54,594
嗯

468
00:29:57,564 --> 00:29:59,362
我們完成我們的使命

469
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:04,238
在規定的時間與零傷亡狀況下
抵達天寧島

470
00:30:04,243 --> 00:30:06,771
(抵達天寧島 1945年7月26日)

471
00:30:17,617 --> 00:30:20,283
我擔心，我們卸下來的這兩箱貨物

472
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,487
可能會永遠地改變戰爭的性質

473
00:30:23,523 --> 00:30:27,192
我們的下一個任務是回到戰場

474
00:30:27,228 --> 00:30:30,661
但我們要求護航保護
仍然沒有被接受

475
00:31:35,432 --> 00:31:38,399
敬我們最棒的牧師！

476
00:31:38,436 --> 00:31:40,735
他是一個極好的夥伴

477
00:31:40,771 --> 00:31:43,238
他是一個極好的夥伴

478
00:31:43,274 --> 00:31:47,142
他是一個極好的夥伴

479
00:31:47,178 --> 00:31:50,111
沒有人可以否認

480
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:54,348
恭喜你最後一次航行，牧師

481
00:31:54,385 --> 00:31:55,816
謝謝你們

482
00:31:55,853 --> 00:31:58,120
我想要拿到寢室吃

483
00:31:59,791 --> 00:32:02,191
別掃興啦，多待一會啦

484
00:32:02,227 --> 00:32:03,858
我很感謝，豆斯今晚沒有

485
00:32:03,894 --> 00:32:06,428
偷偷帶脫衣舞孃來這裏

486
00:32:06,465 --> 00:32:09,131
聽好了，斯坦迪遜正在巡房，對吧？

487
00:32:09,168 --> 00:32:10,298
所以請小聲一點

488
00:32:10,335 --> 00:32:12,268
艾爾文，我知道這要求對你有點難

489
00:32:12,304 --> 00:32:14,836
我這麼無辜，你瞭解我的

490
00:32:14,873 --> 00:32:17,310
再次感謝你們

491
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:26,449
上將，我知道
我們接下來要開往萊特島

492
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,385
但現在我們已經將包裹送達

493
00:32:29,421 --> 00:32:32,556
可以幫我們安排護航艦嗎？

494
00:32:32,592 --> 00:32:35,491
查理，我怎麼可能派護航艦給你？

495
00:32:35,527 --> 00:32:37,363
因為你不曾來過這裏

496
00:32:42,603 --> 00:32:44,400
加油！

497
00:32:44,437 --> 00:32:48,338
加油！

498
00:32:50,277 --> 00:32:51,474
大伙聽好

499
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,612
嘿，我是誰？

500
00:32:54,648 --> 00:32:58,182
我要你們都知道…

501
00:32:58,219 --> 00:33:01,618
我是以第二名的成績
從海軍學校畢業的！

502
00:33:03,723 --> 00:33:08,592
我要把你們訓練成
驍勇善戰的殺戮機器！

503
00:33:12,232 --> 00:33:13,735
所有人注意！

504
00:33:14,802 --> 00:33:15,904
信號員！

505
00:33:19,673 --> 00:33:21,906
酒從哪裏拿到的？

506
00:33:21,942 --> 00:33:24,341
事實上酒是我的

507
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:26,281
是真的嗎？

508
00:33:28,482 --> 00:33:31,520
那麼他之前喝的酒？
也是你的？

509
00:33:35,524 --> 00:33:40,292
把地上的酒擦乾淨！
我們馬上要啟航了！

510
00:33:40,328 --> 00:33:44,229
現在已經沒有自由可言了！
這就是命令！

511
00:33:44,266 --> 00:33:46,865
你們全部到伙食部值班
立即生效！

512
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:51,507
我們在執行任務，不是吟遊秀！
這裏是美國海軍！

513
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:56,247
順便說一句，我是第一名畢業的！

514
00:34:03,581 --> 00:34:06,709
駛離菲律賓天寧島 1945年7月27日
艦上一千一百九十七名官兵

515
00:34:18,568 --> 00:34:20,735
搞什麼？這是不是你的包包

516
00:34:20,771 --> 00:34:23,271
不，這是阿爾文的
我覺得是他拿走戒指

517
00:34:23,307 --> 00:34:25,472
嘿，你會被發現的

518
00:34:25,509 --> 00:34:28,509
我檢查過桑切斯和韋斯特的包包

519
00:34:28,544 --> 00:34:30,644
還是找不到！該死！

520
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:33,747
嘿！斯坦迪遜那晚
謝謝你幫我解圍

521
00:34:33,784 --> 00:34:36,350
我不希望那件事影響你晉陞

522
00:34:36,387 --> 00:34:37,986
好吧，聽我說

523
00:34:38,023 --> 00:34:41,457
這艘戰艦之所以能夠正常運行

524
00:34:41,493 --> 00:34:43,725
是因為他們制定了計劃
而且嚴格遵循行事

525
00:34:43,761 --> 00:34:46,728
所以克萊拉沒有答應我的求婚
或許是件好事

526
00:34:46,764 --> 00:34:49,430
因為我不懂得計劃未來

527
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:51,000
我也無法養活她

528
00:34:51,036 --> 00:34:53,336
我是說，也許這是最好的結果

529
00:34:53,372 --> 00:34:56,606
我現在的計劃
是找到偷我戒指的混蛋

530
00:34:56,642 --> 00:34:59,574
然後一下戰艦，馬上娶她

531
00:34:59,611 --> 00:35:01,743
我不在乎她的父母，或是你

532
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,444
或者其他人有什麼看法

533
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:05,615
嘿，你就是那位負責潛水的？

534
00:35:05,652 --> 00:35:08,283
你要找的是無所不知的
布萊恩史密斯威克？

535
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,489
沒錯，就是他

536
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:13,956
沒錯，我會一點潛水

537
00:35:13,993 --> 00:35:16,425
夥伴，我們想多瞭解鯊魚的事

538
00:35:16,462 --> 00:35:18,961
我一直跟林迪說

539
00:35:18,998 --> 00:35:21,298
除非你在流血
不然鯊魚是不會主動攻擊你的

540
00:35:21,335 --> 00:35:24,438
如果你在流血，那你就糗大了

541
00:35:28,842 --> 00:35:30,978
我經常流鼻血

542
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:33,258
(菲律賓海 1945年7月23日 凌晨)

543
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:34,749
上校來控制台

544
00:35:36,684 --> 00:35:39,383
上校，又有士兵在甲板上睡覺

545
00:35:39,419 --> 00:35:40,785
讓他們睡吧

546
00:35:40,822 --> 00:35:42,920
他們的寢室很熱

547
00:35:42,956 --> 00:35:45,389
能見度如何？很不清楚

548
00:35:45,425 --> 00:35:47,591
開始起霧了

549
00:35:47,628 --> 00:35:49,859
盡快通過這片迷霧區

550
00:35:49,896 --> 00:35:53,397
在霧散之後，再採取Z字型航行
現在全速前進

551
00:35:53,434 --> 00:35:55,701
遵命
斯坦迪遜

552
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:56,934
全速前進

553
00:35:56,971 --> 00:36:00,371
全速前進，小伙子
全速前進

554
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,042
我聽說你懲罰二十四人
到伙食部值班一星期

555
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,844
是的長官
稍後我會把名字提報上去的

556
00:36:05,881 --> 00:36:08,380
日本人的紀律是非常嚴格的，長官

557
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:09,815
如果我們要打敗日本人…

558
00:36:09,852 --> 00:36:14,022
有時候尊重比擔心還有效

559
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,679
很可能是敵軍，方位轉九十度

560
00:36:36,866 --> 00:36:39,837
確定，下潛

561
00:37:06,709 --> 00:37:07,741
德安東尼歐，幹嘛？

562
00:37:07,778 --> 00:37:08,876
夜巡應該走這邊

563
00:37:08,912 --> 00:37:10,444
是他拿走戒指，什麼？

564
00:37:10,481 --> 00:37:11,912
我的訂婚戒指，是豆斯偷走的

565
00:37:11,949 --> 00:37:13,481
當時是他把我從鬥毆中拉走的

566
00:37:13,517 --> 00:37:15,482
龜兒子扒手，不是吧，是豆斯？

567
00:37:15,518 --> 00:37:17,389
你聞起來像酒罐子一樣臭

568
00:37:25,931 --> 00:37:28,763
你就承認吧！承認你害怕了

569
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,435
怕你？你出拳像個娘們一樣

570
00:37:32,471 --> 00:37:36,070
我跟人打架會怯場
這還是第一次聽說

571
00:37:36,106 --> 00:37:40,108
你該慶幸的是那幾個憲兵救了你

572
00:37:40,145 --> 00:37:42,177
否則你會像這火烤雞一樣
被我嚼碎

573
00:37:42,214 --> 00:37:44,179
嘿，大嘴巴

574
00:37:44,216 --> 00:37:45,215
不管你對這只

575
00:37:45,251 --> 00:37:46,682
火烤雞骨頭幹了什麼

576
00:37:46,718 --> 00:37:49,552
我都會一五一十複製在你身上

577
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:53,560
等我離開這裏後
別被我逮到你落單

578
00:38:05,203 --> 00:38:07,106
你舔骨頭的模樣，看起來真熟練

579
00:38:10,911 --> 00:38:11,704
看到船艦了

580
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,903
準備好魚雷

581
00:38:13,101 --> 00:38:14,102
回天魚雷也要待命

582
00:38:14,352 --> 00:38:17,543
看到船艦了，準備好魚雷
回天魚雷也要待命

583
00:38:22,486 --> 00:38:24,530
回天魚雷待命

584
00:38:56,157 --> 00:38:58,190
幸運女神是我的朋友

585
00:38:58,226 --> 00:39:01,261
開局羅，財源滾滾好運連連

586
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,831
好吧

587
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,935
來吧，開牌羅

588
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,837
喔！

589
00:39:11,874 --> 00:39:13,810
方位向右六十度

590
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:16,104
距離一千五百公尺

591
00:39:16,462 --> 00:39:17,710
敵方速度十二節

592
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,536
快點

593
00:39:19,694 --> 00:39:21,109
兩分鐘到達目標

594
00:39:21,571 --> 00:39:22,882
快，快！

595
00:39:25,012 --> 00:39:27,157
十二節，魚雷深度四

596
00:39:33,296 --> 00:39:34,298
發射

597
00:39:41,906 --> 00:39:44,705
啊，就是那，醫官

598
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:48,877
豆斯，我的戒指呢？

599
00:39:48,913 --> 00:39:51,145
你他媽在說什麼？
哦，你心知肚明

600
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:52,884
我說的是什麼！
不，「我不知道你在說什麼」！

601
00:39:56,219 --> 00:39:58,256
雙倍下注！
啊！

602
00:40:05,296 --> 00:40:06,598
我的天啊！

603
00:40:07,881 --> 00:40:12,126
(第一枚魚雷擊中 凌晨)

604
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:13,838
全艦戰備部署！

605
00:40:19,244 --> 00:40:20,646
發射

606
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:37,730
閃開！

607
00:40:46,439 --> 00:40:48,004
戰況報告！

608
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,906
所有通訊都失靈了，長官！
我有叫他們關掉引擎！

609
00:40:50,942 --> 00:40:52,776
但我不知道他們是否有收到！
冷靜點！

610
00:40:52,812 --> 00:40:54,276
卡瓦諾，繼續聯絡引擎室

611
00:40:54,313 --> 00:40:57,147
斯坦迪遜
我需要你派人檢查損傷情況

612
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:02,356
你聽到上校說的沒！走啊！走啊！

613
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:07,924
消防單位，控制火勢！
戰艦右舷著火

614
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,960
快滅火！

615
00:41:15,437 --> 00:41:18,339
趕快關閉引擎！快關掉！

616
00:41:45,467 --> 00:41:47,000
通訊是否連絡上？

617
00:41:47,036 --> 00:41:49,703
無線電壞了，我只好重新接線

618
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:51,170
求救信號發送了嗎？
發了，長官

619
00:41:51,206 --> 00:41:52,705
看看指針，有在移動

620
00:41:52,741 --> 00:41:54,710
幹的好，繼續

621
00:42:07,088 --> 00:42:08,922
別用手摸艙門把手！

622
00:42:11,193 --> 00:42:12,829
我告訴過你不要摸它！

623
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,800
快點！快點！

624
00:42:21,537 --> 00:42:23,707
我們得離開，我們得離開！

625
00:42:25,862 --> 00:42:27,628
直接命中

626
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:35,484
印第安納波利斯號，呼叫
請求支援

627
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,450
是否有人聽見？
有進展嗎？

628
00:42:37,487 --> 00:42:39,221
我不知道，長官

629
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:41,522
繼續呼叫聯絡
遵命，長官

630
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:44,926
受損維修得如何
沒有反應，長官

631
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:47,962
這是印第安納波利斯號呼叫
是否有人聽見？

632
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:50,966
印第安納波利斯號，呼叫
請求支援

633
00:42:51,003 --> 00:42:53,469
印第安納波利斯號
印第安納波利斯號，你有聽見嗎？

634
00:42:53,505 --> 00:42:54,970
這是萊特島

635
00:42:55,006 --> 00:42:56,805
怎麼回事？
三次求救呼叫，長官

636
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,440
有一次呼叫的人，他自稱是上校

637
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:00,274
我派了三艘拖救船支援
誰准的命令？

638
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,210
叫拖救船回來！

639
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:04,412
我們不會派出任何支援
直到知道他們的正確位置

640
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:06,983
這可能是敵方的潛水艇
企圖設下圈套

641
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,217
聽清楚了嗎？
是的長官

642
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:25,001
戰艦嚴重毀損，無法修復了

643
00:43:25,038 --> 00:43:26,869
戰艦要沉了

644
00:43:26,906 --> 00:43:30,073
傳令下去！棄艦

645
00:43:30,109 --> 00:43:33,080
棄艦！棄艦！

646
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:52,162
救我，牧師

647
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:54,497
救我，牧師

648
00:43:54,534 --> 00:43:56,200
我聽到了

649
00:43:56,238 --> 00:43:59,941
救我，牧師！我好害怕

650
00:44:01,541 --> 00:44:03,974
棄艦！棄艦！

651
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:06,209
上校的命令，棄艦！

652
00:44:06,247 --> 00:44:08,349
趕快收拾文件！
遵命，長官

653
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,859
所有人到甲板上集合！
棄艦！

654
00:44:24,466 --> 00:44:26,899
趕快，趕快！

655
00:44:26,935 --> 00:44:28,100
我找到鑰匙了！

656
00:44:31,507 --> 00:44:33,638
快救我！

657
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:34,910
也幫幫我！

658
00:44:39,081 --> 00:44:41,081
趕快，趕快！

659
00:44:42,684 --> 00:44:46,018
鑰匙，鑰匙掉了！
我找不到了！

660
00:44:46,054 --> 00:44:49,455
嘿！不！

661
00:44:49,492 --> 00:44:53,424
嘿，你們不能丟下我！
求你們回來！

662
00:44:53,462 --> 00:44:55,095
求求你們

663
00:45:05,441 --> 00:45:07,975
走，小心

664
00:45:08,011 --> 00:45:09,180
快走！

665
00:45:21,991 --> 00:45:25,526
快，趕快離開！

666
00:45:25,563 --> 00:45:30,064
求求你們回來！救命啊！

667
00:45:30,101 --> 00:45:34,636
加裏森，求求你回來！

668
00:45:34,672 --> 00:45:36,242
快，趕快離開！

669
00:45:37,709 --> 00:45:41,580
加裏森，請救救我！
回來吧！救救我！

670
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,691
巴馬，扔掉文件！

671
00:45:54,728 --> 00:45:56,959
上校命令扔掉文件

672
00:46:01,499 --> 00:46:04,070
救命啊！

673
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:08,375
幫我抬一下救生艇！

674
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,657
救命啊！

675
00:46:24,491 --> 00:46:26,723
加裏森！

676
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,225
快去找鑰匙

677
00:46:29,262 --> 00:46:31,060
幫助我離開這裏，加裏森

678
00:46:31,097 --> 00:46:33,133
把燈拿好！把燈拿好！

679
00:46:36,235 --> 00:46:38,336
快找鑰匙！

680
00:46:38,372 --> 00:46:40,005
加裏森，快點！

681
00:46:44,477 --> 00:46:46,447
找到了
給我

682
00:46:51,718 --> 00:46:53,288
快點

683
00:46:57,391 --> 00:46:58,493
我們被鎖在裏面！

684
00:47:09,103 --> 00:47:10,501
棄艦！

685
00:47:10,538 --> 00:47:13,239
跳下水後，盡快游離開戰艦

686
00:47:13,275 --> 00:47:14,806
游得越遠越好

687
00:47:14,842 --> 00:47:17,677
離開油污洩漏的區域

688
00:47:17,713 --> 00:47:19,149
卡瓦諾，快跳！

689
00:47:31,394 --> 00:47:32,596
這是命令！

690
00:47:49,712 --> 00:47:52,245
戰艦裂開了，戰艦裂開了

691
00:47:52,281 --> 00:47:53,718
戰艦裂開了
聽我說

692
00:48:02,659 --> 00:48:05,360
對不起！

693
00:48:05,396 --> 00:48:07,095
和我一起祈禱，和我一起祈禱

694
00:48:07,131 --> 00:48:08,395
「我們在天國的上帝…」

695
00:48:08,432 --> 00:48:10,264
你不該回來救我，我很抱歉

696
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,335
抱歉，是我害了你，對不起

697
00:48:13,371 --> 00:48:14,740
「你們的意願已完成」

698
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,905
快跳！快，快，跳啊！

699
00:51:45,425 --> 00:51:46,827
哈羅？

700
00:51:50,429 --> 00:51:53,330
哈囉！

701
00:51:53,367 --> 00:51:55,398
有人聽到嗎？

702
00:51:55,435 --> 00:51:57,634
哈羅？

703
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:01,072
哈羅？

704
00:52:01,108 --> 00:52:03,045
有人聽到嗎？

705
00:52:28,136 --> 00:52:29,706
保羅？

706
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:35,043
保羅

707
00:53:18,354 --> 00:53:24,428
第一天 1945年7月30日
九百零二名生還 糧食剩兩天

708
00:53:25,195 --> 00:53:27,494
把頭抬高，快

709
00:53:27,531 --> 00:53:29,897
快，跟我一起踢水

710
00:53:29,933 --> 00:53:33,734
踢水，踢水，就是這樣

711
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:36,538
來吧，夥伴！頭抬高

712
00:53:47,818 --> 00:53:49,087
天啊

713
00:54:18,751 --> 00:54:23,053
這裏不安全，我們得去救生艇上

714
00:54:23,089 --> 00:54:26,922
長官，你瘋了嗎？
我們離開這塊板

715
00:54:26,958 --> 00:54:30,660
這木板在下沉，這是命令

716
00:54:30,696 --> 00:54:32,232
不

717
00:54:37,704 --> 00:54:39,240
把林迪拉上救生艇

718
00:54:39,244 --> 00:54:41,850
A-組，位於印第安納波利斯號
西南方二點四英哩

719
00:54:41,875 --> 00:54:42,874
拉他起來，加把勁

720
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:45,214
就是這樣！

721
00:54:49,783 --> 00:54:51,581
是誰把我們擊沉的？

722
00:54:51,617 --> 00:54:53,717
一定是日本鬼子

723
00:54:53,754 --> 00:54:56,858
他們應該還在四處巡邏
要將我們趕盡殺絕

724
00:54:59,092 --> 00:55:01,858
求救信號發出去了嗎？
應該吧

725
00:55:01,894 --> 00:55:03,629
有人會知道我們失蹤了

726
00:55:03,665 --> 00:55:06,869
他們會來救我們的，兄弟
他們會來救我們的

727
00:55:08,879 --> 00:55:13,126
(B組 位於A組西方一英哩)

728
00:55:18,179 --> 00:55:21,812
你們沒事嗎？
上校有逃出來嗎？

729
00:55:21,849 --> 00:55:23,685
上校跟戰艦一起沉下去了！

730
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:29,188
所有人注意！注意！

731
00:55:29,224 --> 00:55:33,792
如果你沒有受傷而且在救生艇上，離開救生艇

732
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:37,597
救生艇是給受傷人員及軍官的！

733
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:42,302
現在將所有救援物資集中到這裏！

734
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,909
抓住我的手
來人啊，幫幫我

735
00:55:47,109 --> 00:55:48,679
快！

736
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:54,646
離開救生艇

737
00:55:54,683 --> 00:55:57,086
讓受傷人員上救生艇

738
00:55:57,811 --> 00:56:04,068
麥克維上校
位於 A組與B組 南方

739
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:11,603
堅持住

740
00:56:19,144 --> 00:56:21,842
上校，嘿，你逃出來了

741
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:24,816
坎貝爾，坎貝爾

742
00:56:27,118 --> 00:56:29,218
急救藥包

743
00:56:29,253 --> 00:56:31,019
我需要它

744
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:36,024
嘿…你成功了
上校，你逃出來了

745
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:39,064
你有嗎啡嗎？嘿

746
00:56:44,002 --> 00:56:46,635
你逃出來了

747
00:56:46,671 --> 00:56:49,738
好…啊

748
00:56:53,845 --> 00:56:57,283
這是不是我要掛點的徵兆？

749
00:57:08,761 --> 00:57:12,029
把腿部抬高！把腿部抬高！

750
00:57:12,066 --> 00:57:14,831
好的

751
00:57:14,867 --> 00:57:16,833
別走

752
00:57:16,869 --> 00:57:18,970
長官，求你別走

753
00:57:19,006 --> 00:57:22,371
我不會走
求你別走，別離開我

754
00:57:22,408 --> 00:57:24,273
我的小男孩還好吧？
他很好

755
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:28,046
是的，他很堅強，像他爸爸一樣

756
00:57:28,082 --> 00:57:31,682
真的？
求你別走，不要留下我一個人

757
00:57:31,718 --> 00:57:34,389
不會的，我不會離開你的

758
00:57:41,103 --> 00:57:46,902
美國海軍中尉，安卓馬克思
搜索海上失事飛機

759
00:58:02,485 --> 00:58:04,783
我想說的是

760
00:58:04,819 --> 00:58:06,819
如果你要甩掉一個女人

761
00:58:06,856 --> 00:58:10,054
你要造成讓她認為
是她甩了你的這種假象

762
00:58:10,091 --> 00:58:12,025
是嗎？你如何做到的？

763
00:58:12,061 --> 00:58:15,060
這需要更多的歷練才能領悟

764
00:58:15,097 --> 00:58:18,164
你還沒有這份功力，老弟

765
00:58:20,035 --> 00:58:22,468
冷靜！省點力氣！

766
00:58:22,505 --> 00:58:24,137
冷靜！

767
00:58:24,174 --> 00:58:26,872
你連向飛機求救都懶得求嗎，長官？

768
00:58:26,908 --> 00:58:28,941
你以為我招手他們就一定看的到嗎？

769
00:58:28,978 --> 00:58:30,876
我要殺了你！

770
00:58:30,912 --> 00:58:33,513
信不信我讓你受軍法制裁，水手！
動手啊！

771
00:58:33,549 --> 00:58:35,515
如果我們獲救…如果我們獲救的話…

772
00:58:38,188 --> 00:58:41,221
大家冷靜下來！
我們很快就會獲救的

773
00:58:41,257 --> 00:58:43,957
兄弟們還希望我們帶領他們活下去呢

774
00:58:43,994 --> 00:58:45,862
我們需要團結

775
00:58:47,532 --> 00:58:50,400
我要把醫官的救生衣脫下來

776
00:58:58,342 --> 00:59:01,107
上帝，保佑他的靈魂

777
00:59:01,144 --> 00:59:05,246
以聖父，聖子，聖靈的名

778
00:59:05,282 --> 00:59:08,416
我們還要繞圈圈多久
一小時，還是一天？

779
00:59:08,452 --> 00:59:10,283
繼續尋找

780
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,487
失事飛機上有九人失去行蹤，中尉

781
00:59:12,523 --> 00:59:14,222
這簡直是大海撈針

782
00:59:14,258 --> 00:59:16,123
即使有他們的座標位置
但我們的燃料不足

783
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:17,291
無法返回基地

784
00:59:19,329 --> 00:59:20,494
你們有聽到嗎？

785
00:59:20,531 --> 00:59:22,531
有看到失蹤飛機嗎？

786
00:59:22,567 --> 00:59:23,999
還沒有，長官

787
00:59:24,035 --> 00:59:26,401
需要再來回多找幾次

788
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:28,836
不行，你們已經在那裏找很久了

789
00:59:28,874 --> 00:59:31,406
飛回基地

790
00:59:47,927 --> 00:59:49,491
就是這樣

791
00:59:49,528 --> 00:59:50,994
抓住木板

792
00:59:55,069 --> 00:59:58,367
奎因…

793
00:59:58,403 --> 01:00:00,404
你的臉色看起來很糟糕

794
01:00:00,441 --> 01:00:02,973
我們得讓你待在救生艇上

795
01:00:03,008 --> 01:00:05,509
蛤，不要

796
01:00:05,545 --> 01:00:08,311
不想跟他待在一起，不要

797
01:00:08,348 --> 01:00:11,316
你繼續吹口琴，繼續吹

798
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:20,091
希歐多爾
你在那本冊子上寫些什麼呢？

799
01:00:20,127 --> 01:00:23,193
「親愛的媽媽，早知道我就好好學游泳」

800
01:00:23,229 --> 01:00:26,129
「但現在我都快淹死了」

801
01:00:28,669 --> 01:00:31,301
什麼這麼好笑，蛤？

802
01:00:31,338 --> 01:00:34,372
你知道嗎，我們都會死的？

803
01:00:34,409 --> 01:00:36,341
你們知道，是吧？

804
01:00:36,378 --> 01:00:40,279
最好笑的一點是
你們這些伙食班弟兄，居然會為一個

805
01:00:40,315 --> 01:00:43,881
根本不在乎你的國家，壯烈捐軀

806
01:00:43,918 --> 01:00:45,918
是啊，我並不期待無知的白種人

807
01:00:45,954 --> 01:00:49,354
或其他人在乎關心我

808
01:00:49,392 --> 01:00:51,991
在底特律我是得不到這種待遇

809
01:00:52,028 --> 01:00:55,662
這麼說吧，入伍前，我的心早就死了

810
01:00:55,697 --> 01:00:57,462
我也是

811
01:00:57,499 --> 01:01:01,568
我爸和我的小弟
在加爾維斯頓的街頭被人殺了

812
01:01:01,604 --> 01:01:05,103
另外，我想出去看看外面的世界

813
01:01:05,141 --> 01:01:06,472
外國的月亮比較圓嘛！

814
01:01:08,544 --> 01:01:10,276
我同意

815
01:01:10,313 --> 01:01:13,580
嘿，希歐多爾
你可以把它寫下來

816
01:01:13,615 --> 01:01:16,416
把冒險，性愛…

817
01:01:16,452 --> 01:01:19,218
這些主題寫到書裏
它一定會大賣的

818
01:01:19,254 --> 01:01:21,552
我們甚至會有新版的新約聖經

819
01:01:38,308 --> 01:01:40,007
那邊怎麼了！

820
01:01:40,044 --> 01:01:42,380
到救生艇上去，快上去

821
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:46,013
別待在水裏！快上救生艇

822
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:50,984
所有人別待在水裏！
別待在水裏！

823
01:01:51,021 --> 01:01:54,155
老兄，別待在水裏！
你在做什麼？

824
01:01:54,192 --> 01:01:56,425
不要游了，別待在水裏

825
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:59,131
他要游去哪裏？

826
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,302
發生什麼事？

827
01:02:11,442 --> 01:02:13,111
回報狀況

828
01:02:14,987 --> 01:02:18,951
還沒有人去救他們，請指示

829
01:02:21,296 --> 01:02:22,496
謝謝

830
01:02:37,237 --> 01:02:39,702
願主保佑你，與你同在

831
01:02:39,738 --> 01:02:42,075
願他的光澤照耀你

832
01:02:44,443 --> 01:02:46,713
阿門

833
01:03:15,777 --> 01:03:19,148
親愛的上帝，引領我的靈魂…

834
01:03:24,351 --> 01:03:25,687
感謝上帝

835
01:03:39,867 --> 01:03:43,268
啊！快起來，渾蛋！

836
01:03:43,304 --> 01:03:45,338
有東西在那裏！那是鯊魚！

837
01:03:45,374 --> 01:03:48,541
希歐多爾，希歐多爾
你有沒有看到其他組員？

838
01:03:48,577 --> 01:03:50,810
我就是從一堆人裏逃出來的
那裏還有一百多人呢

839
01:03:50,847 --> 01:03:53,213
在哪個方向？那邊！

840
01:03:53,249 --> 01:03:56,115
渾蛋！

841
01:04:02,325 --> 01:04:04,290
剝開後幫他注射

842
01:04:04,326 --> 01:04:05,792
我過去看看

843
01:04:05,829 --> 01:04:08,160
不會離開很久，看能不能找到他們

844
01:04:08,197 --> 01:04:12,165
不，等等，上校！
別丟下我們！

845
01:04:12,201 --> 01:04:15,103
跟他說話，轉移他的注意力！

846
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:18,172
安撫他！
等一下，上校！

847
01:04:18,208 --> 01:04:20,540
長官！上校！

848
01:04:20,576 --> 01:04:22,079
救我

849
01:04:37,562 --> 01:04:42,564
贊嘆恩典

850
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:47,869
多麼甜美的聲音

851
01:04:47,906 --> 01:04:50,738
救

852
01:04:50,775 --> 01:04:53,207
一個無助的人

853
01:04:53,244 --> 01:04:57,479
像我

854
01:04:57,516 --> 01:05:00,415
我曾經迷失…

855
01:05:08,326 --> 01:05:10,859
沒事…

856
01:05:12,731 --> 01:05:16,933
哦，基督憐憫我！

857
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:19,502
他走進了飯廳，眼中閃爍著

858
01:05:19,539 --> 01:05:22,506
搖擲骰子
並說，幸運女神是我的朋友

859
01:05:22,542 --> 01:05:24,373
財源滾滾，好運連連

860
01:05:24,410 --> 01:05:26,510
你在做什麼？
我在朗誦

861
01:05:26,546 --> 01:05:28,512
蛤？朗誦！

862
01:05:28,548 --> 01:05:31,447
朗誦些好聽的
我他媽的都快死了！

863
01:05:31,484 --> 01:05:33,217
好吧好吧！

864
01:05:33,253 --> 01:05:36,419
朗誦更好聽的
對不起！

865
01:05:36,455 --> 01:05:38,255
我第一次見到她時

866
01:05:38,292 --> 01:05:40,557
是在舊金山市場街

867
01:05:40,593 --> 01:05:42,892
她穿著紅色禮服
在人群中非常醒目

868
01:05:42,929 --> 01:05:44,662
是緊身連衣裙還是？

869
01:05:44,698 --> 01:05:46,863
當然，當然，緊身連衣裙

870
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:49,867
非常緊，緊到讓人想入非非

871
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:51,568
這是你寫的？

872
01:05:51,605 --> 01:05:53,938
是啊，這是我的冊子

873
01:05:53,975 --> 01:05:57,612
那很好，再念一遍

874
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:04,549
我第一次見到…
長官先生，別睡著

875
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:06,485
我會念給你聽，仔細聽，好嗎？

876
01:06:06,521 --> 01:06:10,721
好的？
她是如此的…

877
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:13,958
她安全了，她知道了

878
01:06:13,995 --> 01:06:17,729
真正重要的
不是你所面對的困難是什麼

879
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:19,668
而是你的態度和做法

880
01:06:26,742 --> 01:06:27,974
她彷彿是一個墮落的天使

881
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:29,474
天上的天使？

882
01:06:29,511 --> 01:06:31,944
她被上帝派遣去保護他

883
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:34,746
「看著我的雙眼」，她笑著說

884
01:06:34,783 --> 01:06:38,517
她的觸摸讓水手的心為之一震

885
01:06:38,554 --> 01:06:40,319
把救生艇綁在一起！

886
01:06:40,355 --> 01:06:43,790
發現更多的弟兄跟補給用品

887
01:06:43,827 --> 01:06:45,459
這兩個兄弟說，他們和你一樣

888
01:06:45,495 --> 01:06:48,294
都是從大單位走散的，希歐多爾

889
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:49,730
你們還好吧？

890
01:06:49,766 --> 01:06:51,330
這個年輕人在講故事

891
01:06:51,367 --> 01:06:53,834
讓我這個老芋仔臉紅尷尬，麥克維

892
01:06:55,838 --> 01:06:59,539
繼續說下去，老兄
最後他們是否在一起了？

893
01:06:59,575 --> 01:07:01,979
繼續啊

894
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:06,379
我將一生一世愛著你

895
01:07:06,416 --> 01:07:09,416
她輕聲細語說，然後…

896
01:07:09,452 --> 01:07:13,487
她躺到他的懷裏，與他共度良宵

897
01:07:18,796 --> 01:07:20,695
親愛的路易絲

898
01:07:20,732 --> 01:07:23,030
我們在海上漂流兩天了
(第二天 : 1945年7月31日 )
(六百九十八名生還，糧食剩一天)

899
01:07:23,067 --> 01:07:25,566
還是沒有任何救援到來
(六百九十八名生還，糧食剩一天)

900
01:07:25,603 --> 01:07:28,703
我害怕讓弟兄失望了

901
01:07:28,739 --> 01:07:32,508
我用盡一切辦法給弟兄鼓勵

902
01:07:32,544 --> 01:07:34,510
午餐肉！
雖然糧食有限

903
01:07:34,546 --> 01:07:36,348
酒店招牌菜

904
01:07:46,759 --> 01:07:47,860
天啊

905
01:07:48,927 --> 01:07:50,893
這是…

906
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:52,929
狒狒屁股…

907
01:07:52,965 --> 01:07:54,868
嘗起來像上等牛排

908
01:08:00,005 --> 01:08:03,372
我們每天開一罐

909
01:08:03,409 --> 01:08:05,908
往自己頭上撒些海水

910
01:08:05,945 --> 01:08:09,512
讓微風幫你降溫

911
01:08:09,548 --> 01:08:15,019
但不要喝海水，會讓你抓狂的

912
01:08:15,055 --> 01:08:19,923
飛機會發現我們才有鬼

913
01:08:19,959 --> 01:08:23,093
但不管希望多麼渺茫

914
01:08:23,129 --> 01:08:24,597
我還是會不時地仰望天空

915
01:08:49,891 --> 01:08:51,123
安靜一下

916
01:08:52,493 --> 01:08:53,925
為什麼，那個吝嗇老鬼

917
01:08:53,961 --> 01:08:55,526
他可以從盲眼蜘蛛手中偷走蒼蠅

918
01:08:55,563 --> 01:08:56,794
是啊，但是他剛過世

919
01:08:56,831 --> 01:08:57,862
留下五十萬美元給你

920
01:08:57,899 --> 01:08:59,035
五十萬？

921
01:09:08,643 --> 01:09:11,611
我教會她好幾個舞步

922
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:15,652
天啊…她真的有跳舞的天賦

923
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,620
克萊拉是全世界最可愛的

924
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:22,054
你知道她喜歡叫我什麼嗎，巴馬？

925
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:23,823
不知道

926
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:25,763
我不想聽這個

927
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:29,429
我告訴過你

928
01:09:29,466 --> 01:09:30,802
別在救生艇上吐，麻煩鬼！

929
01:09:38,909 --> 01:09:40,678
見鬼啦！

930
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,119
住手！住手！

931
01:09:52,155 --> 01:09:53,792
你這樣不是在嚇跑他們的！

932
01:09:56,226 --> 01:09:58,463
是替他們搖開飯鈴

933
01:10:01,799 --> 01:10:05,233
不能用我的安納波利斯戒指作為誘餌

934
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:07,902
因為它象徵著好運

935
01:10:07,938 --> 01:10:10,672
但可以用我的結婚戒指

936
01:10:10,709 --> 01:10:13,241
我的妻子會理解的

937
01:10:13,277 --> 01:10:17,512
你知道嗎，她喜歡釣魚

938
01:10:17,548 --> 01:10:19,918
甚至比我還熱衷

939
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:27,655
你們怎們認識的？

940
01:10:27,691 --> 01:10:31,093
你是想加到您的創意題材之中吧，是嗎？

941
01:10:31,129 --> 01:10:34,563
不會的，長官

942
01:10:34,599 --> 01:10:39,068
我們是在華盛頓特區郊外的
吉維蔡斯俱樂部

943
01:10:39,104 --> 01:10:41,170
當時樂隊在演奏「天降財神」

944
01:10:41,206 --> 01:10:42,705
我看到她

945
01:10:42,741 --> 01:10:46,246
她喃喃地跟著唱

946
01:10:56,756 --> 01:10:58,526
她是我的一切

947
01:11:04,598 --> 01:11:08,502
你一定也非常想念家人了

948
01:11:13,874 --> 01:11:17,174
你有沒有告訴你老婆？

949
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:18,975
就是你剛剛對我說的那些？

950
01:11:19,011 --> 01:11:21,746
告訴她什麼？

951
01:11:21,783 --> 01:11:23,051
你對她的感覺

952
01:11:25,886 --> 01:11:27,755
我試著寫信給她

953
01:11:29,591 --> 01:11:31,590
但我就是詞窮…

954
01:11:31,627 --> 01:11:34,760
不行！上帝！
我有一個小兒子，但我還未見過他！

955
01:11:34,796 --> 01:11:37,796
不要！我不要天使！
天使別來找我！

956
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:40,966
拜託，拜託，上帝！

957
01:11:41,003 --> 01:11:43,135
按住它，按住它

958
01:11:43,172 --> 01:11:45,337
還沒看到他前，不要讓我死在這裏

959
01:11:45,373 --> 01:11:47,672
抓住我的手，我不想死啊！

960
01:11:47,709 --> 01:11:50,312
還沒看到他前，不要讓我死…

961
01:12:19,008 --> 01:12:21,744
到現在仍然沒有人去救他們

962
01:12:24,792 --> 01:12:26,342
他們是敵人

963
01:12:27,191 --> 01:12:29,262
但他們也是人

964
01:13:05,824 --> 01:13:08,995
上校，上校？

965
01:13:12,832 --> 01:13:14,300
沒事的

966
01:13:16,735 --> 01:13:18,171
救援艦隊快到了

967
01:13:23,743 --> 01:13:25,044
休息一下

968
01:13:32,218 --> 01:13:35,164
你們聽從命令馬上返回日本

969
01:13:36,898 --> 01:13:38,817
天皇下令的

970
01:13:47,133 --> 01:13:49,167
全體注意！

971
01:13:49,203 --> 01:13:51,133
如果真的有人要過來救我們

972
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:52,736
他們早就應該出現了

973
01:13:52,772 --> 01:13:56,940
我發現幾英哩外有個小島

974
01:13:56,977 --> 01:13:58,442
這不可能

975
01:13:58,478 --> 01:14:00,911
我們在菲律賓海的某個位置上

976
01:14:00,948 --> 01:14:03,080
你不知道我們在哪裏

977
01:14:03,117 --> 01:14:04,816
我們要順著洋流

978
01:14:04,853 --> 01:14:06,249
我們要劃到那個島上去

979
01:14:06,286 --> 01:14:08,186
上校會希望我們聚在一起

980
01:14:08,223 --> 01:14:10,923
上校死了，你明白嗎？

981
01:14:10,959 --> 01:14:12,356
現在由我掌管

982
01:14:12,393 --> 01:14:14,258
我需要一些狀況好的弟兄

983
01:14:14,295 --> 01:14:17,733
誰厭倦了當鯊魚誘餌
現在就和我一起去！

984
01:14:19,299 --> 01:14:20,936
你過來

985
01:14:22,071 --> 01:14:24,268
你也過來

986
01:14:24,304 --> 01:14:27,876
很明顯地，我們不能帶受傷流血的人

987
01:14:30,078 --> 01:14:32,376
對不起，小伙子！

988
01:14:32,413 --> 01:14:35,050
我向我媽保證過要安全回家的

989
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:43,490
來吧，游過來

990
01:14:43,526 --> 01:14:47,827
還有，瓦克斯曼
我要你負責照顧傷患

991
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:49,763
還有那兩個鬧事的

992
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,430
你們看起來還蠻合得來的

993
01:14:51,467 --> 01:14:55,435
能否留一些補給品給我們，長官？

994
01:14:55,471 --> 01:14:57,872
那個多的救生艇就留給你們

995
01:14:57,908 --> 01:15:00,372
別擔心，我們會找人來救你們的

996
01:15:00,409 --> 01:15:02,474
陸戰隊哥，你呢？

997
01:15:02,511 --> 01:15:06,079
我留下來陪牧師

998
01:15:06,116 --> 01:15:07,914
很好，那麼

999
01:15:07,951 --> 01:15:09,516
每個人抓好槳，開始划船

1000
01:15:09,552 --> 01:15:13,854
動作一致點
我知道大家都很累了

1001
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:15,855
小島就在那一邊

1002
01:15:15,891 --> 01:15:17,327
上帝保佑你們

1003
01:15:26,037 --> 01:15:29,341
劃，劃，用力劃

1004
01:15:38,616 --> 01:15:41,483
麥克

1005
01:15:41,519 --> 01:15:44,286
麥克

1006
01:15:44,322 --> 01:15:46,988
麥克，你在那裏嗎？

1007
01:15:47,025 --> 01:15:49,423
我們在這裏！

1008
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:53,862
巴馬，巴馬，醒醒，他們來了

1009
01:15:53,899 --> 01:15:56,598
什麼？我們要離開這裏了

1010
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:58,036
他們來了

1011
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:02,571
是克萊拉！是克萊拉！是克萊拉！

1012
01:16:09,281 --> 01:16:12,582
冷靜！嘿，嘿！那都是幻覺

1013
01:16:12,618 --> 01:16:14,983
冷靜，嘿，冷靜下來

1014
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:17,054
那只是幻覺

1015
01:16:17,091 --> 01:16:19,455
冷靜下來，哥們

1016
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:21,395
我愛她，邁克

1017
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,933
我愛克萊拉！

1018
01:16:33,373 --> 01:16:35,143
我是愛著她的

1019
01:16:36,976 --> 01:16:40,477
自從在第一浸信會主日學校開始

1020
01:16:40,514 --> 01:16:45,552
我…我想親手做些禮物給她

1021
01:16:56,162 --> 01:16:56,661
那是什麼？

1022
01:17:01,403 --> 01:17:03,935
是鯊魚！進去救生艇，進去救生艇

1023
01:17:03,972 --> 01:17:05,640
這樣救生艇會翻的，你到另一邊去

1024
01:17:23,625 --> 01:17:26,524
媽的，臭死人

1025
01:17:26,561 --> 01:17:29,128
可能已經死了兩小時以上

1026
01:17:29,165 --> 01:17:31,033
把他的救生衣脫下來

1027
01:17:34,136 --> 01:17:36,101
哦，天啊，那是希歐多爾

1028
01:17:36,137 --> 01:17:40,406
那是他的書

1029
01:17:40,443 --> 01:17:43,543
鯊魚把他的頭啃掉

1030
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:47,481
誰生誰死，你覺得是靠運氣嗎？

1031
01:17:47,517 --> 01:17:49,452
是他的時候到了

1032
01:17:52,321 --> 01:17:55,690
我希望我可以是
不足以好到上天堂

1033
01:17:55,727 --> 01:17:58,425
卻又不會壞到下地獄的境地

1034
01:17:58,462 --> 01:18:00,628
我覺得宗教都是人們

1035
01:18:00,664 --> 01:18:04,031
編出來安慰自己的

1036
01:18:04,068 --> 01:18:06,200
上帝怎麼可能存在

1037
01:18:06,237 --> 01:18:10,237
至少我還沒見過

1038
01:18:10,273 --> 01:18:12,974
至少，我不信這些

1039
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:16,243
死亡啦，惡魔啦…

1040
01:18:16,279 --> 01:18:20,549
我見過一個男人
願意為另一個男人犧牲自己的生命

1041
01:18:20,586 --> 01:18:23,652
我是不想左右你該相信什麼，兄弟

1042
01:18:23,688 --> 01:18:27,255
我…我只是知道
世界上還有很多好的一面

1043
01:18:27,292 --> 01:18:29,491
還有…

1044
01:18:29,527 --> 01:18:31,593
我很想重溫那種感覺

1045
01:18:31,630 --> 01:18:35,097
你是說你的女朋友？
嗯

1046
01:18:35,133 --> 01:18:40,203
她真的是密西根州的腕力冠軍？

1047
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:41,502
連續兩年冠軍

1048
01:18:50,115 --> 01:18:52,051
千萬別跟她鬧彆扭噢

1049
01:19:17,277 --> 01:19:19,681
你覺得這會搞砸我的求婚計劃？

1050
01:19:22,183 --> 01:19:24,181
其實…

1051
01:19:24,218 --> 01:19:25,784
這叫做為林迪舞

1052
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:37,265
要是她不相信我給她買了戒指怎麼辦？

1053
01:19:39,232 --> 01:19:43,701
那你就再買個戒指親手送給她

1054
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:47,409
她是個非常優秀的女孩，對吧？

1055
01:19:49,877 --> 01:19:52,377
好好照顧她

1056
01:19:52,414 --> 01:19:55,112
什麼？
答應我，巴馬

1057
01:19:55,149 --> 01:19:57,383
好好照顧她

1058
01:19:57,419 --> 01:19:58,584
嘿，你別說了

1059
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:01,157
聽著，巴馬
還記得在艦上逃亡時？

1060
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,197
你告訴我別慌亂

1061
01:20:09,398 --> 01:20:10,500
我沒聽進去

1062
01:20:13,668 --> 01:20:15,337
非要去抓艙門把手

1063
01:20:17,206 --> 01:20:20,640
結果燙傷雙手，巴馬

1064
01:20:20,677 --> 01:20:26,313
手掌皮都燒爛了，我從不聽勸告

1065
01:20:26,349 --> 01:20:28,715
你是在做你所認為應該做的事情

1066
01:20:28,752 --> 01:20:30,421
我只會讓她陷入麻煩

1067
01:20:34,324 --> 01:20:36,622
這就是為什麼…

1068
01:20:36,659 --> 01:20:38,361
那枚戒指

1069
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,570
一個這麼漂亮的女孩

1070
01:20:59,616 --> 01:21:02,654
麥克？麥克？

1071
01:21:11,396 --> 01:21:13,861
麥克？

1072
01:21:13,898 --> 01:21:15,168
嘿

1073
01:21:19,237 --> 01:21:21,240
不要死

1074
01:22:03,383 --> 01:22:05,252
嘿，有人來了

1075
01:22:11,859 --> 01:22:13,528
韋斯特

1076
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:24,002
他們都死了

1077
01:22:24,038 --> 01:22:25,869
斯坦迪遜，卡瓦諾

1078
01:22:25,906 --> 01:22:27,509
到處都是鯊魚

1079
01:22:28,842 --> 01:22:32,611
韋斯特，你還好吧？

1080
01:22:32,647 --> 01:22:35,346
原諒我，牧師

1081
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:37,783
我很抱歉
沒關係

1082
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:39,517
你安全了
我很抱歉

1083
01:22:39,554 --> 01:22:40,690
你安全了

1084
01:22:45,026 --> 01:22:46,362
不

1085
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:55,301
離開水裏！

1086
01:22:55,338 --> 01:22:57,302
快游！快游！

1087
01:22:59,674 --> 01:23:01,378
快上來！

1088
01:23:20,397 --> 01:23:22,630
不

1089
01:23:22,666 --> 01:23:24,769
他媽的！

1090
01:23:35,078 --> 01:23:38,545
漂流第四天 1945年8月2日
三百五十名生還

1091
01:23:38,582 --> 01:23:40,718
很多弟兄已經放棄了

1092
01:23:45,523 --> 01:23:48,924
我看到有些弟兄
非常堅強

1093
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,760
他們被這恐怖的惡境折磨

1094
01:23:51,796 --> 01:23:55,535
但還是繼續努力堅持力抗下去

1095
01:23:57,402 --> 01:24:00,774
另一部分弟兄卻處在崩潰的邊緣

1096
01:26:18,231 --> 01:26:20,326
美國海軍PV1轟炸機
查克葛林中蔚

1097
01:26:31,996 --> 01:26:35,029
加裏森

1098
01:26:35,066 --> 01:26:37,135
加裏森，那是…是幻覺嗎？

1099
01:26:39,871 --> 01:26:41,971
那個混蛋越來越近，你是否看見？

1100
01:26:42,007 --> 01:26:44,240
你看到了嗎？

1101
01:26:44,276 --> 01:26:48,177
救命！我們在這裏！我們在這裏！

1102
01:26:48,214 --> 01:26:50,980
我看不到，我看不到了

1103
01:26:51,016 --> 01:26:53,487
我看不到…我什麼都看不到

1104
01:26:55,587 --> 01:26:56,986
向他們招手，飛機很接近了

1105
01:26:57,023 --> 01:26:59,893
喂！喂！嘿！

1106
01:27:02,193 --> 01:27:04,560
除了靜電干擾
什麼都沒有發現，長官

1107
01:27:04,596 --> 01:27:06,763
那是天線干擾
我以為你有檢查過了

1108
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:07,934
我調過了啊

1109
01:27:13,939 --> 01:27:15,642
他媽的

1110
01:27:18,945 --> 01:27:20,715
往下看！

1111
01:27:28,255 --> 01:27:29,886
我們在某些東西的上空

1112
01:27:29,923 --> 01:27:31,855
我想這應該是日本潛水艇的漏油

1113
01:27:31,891 --> 01:27:34,195
我們繞回去，準備投放炸彈

1114
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:45,971
他看到我們了！他看到我們了！

1115
01:27:46,007 --> 01:27:48,038
他看到我們了！

1116
01:27:48,075 --> 01:27:50,342
五十公尺後進行投彈！坐穩囉！

1117
01:27:50,378 --> 01:27:53,044
你確定那是日本潛水艇嗎，長官？

1118
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:56,181
不然還有誰會在這裏？
你有看到嗎？

1119
01:27:56,218 --> 01:27:57,287
聽我的指示！

1120
01:28:03,092 --> 01:28:06,926
你…看見了嗎，隊長？

1121
01:28:06,962 --> 01:28:10,730
你有看…看到這個？

1122
01:28:10,766 --> 01:28:12,067
它沒有看到我們

1123
01:28:14,268 --> 01:28:16,572
只看到漏油

1124
01:28:20,375 --> 01:28:24,276
投彈倒數計時，三，二，一

1125
01:28:24,313 --> 01:28:25,982
等一等！等一等！

1126
01:28:28,816 --> 01:28:31,817
數英哩的範圍內
有上百人分散在海上

1127
01:28:31,854 --> 01:28:33,057
快聯絡總部吧

1128
01:28:37,693 --> 01:28:40,094
這是賭徒17號戰機

1129
01:28:40,130 --> 01:28:42,160
我們發現海上有數百名生還者

1130
01:28:42,197 --> 01:28:45,735
我再說一遍
我們發現海上有數百名生還者

1131
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:52,039
這裏是琥珀17號，收到

1132
01:28:52,076 --> 01:28:53,906
我們必須按照計劃行動

1133
01:28:53,942 --> 01:28:55,745
日軍可能還在那裏

1134
01:29:00,216 --> 01:29:03,952
中尉！中尉！中尉長官！

1135
01:29:03,988 --> 01:29:05,291
中尉，長官！

1136
01:29:07,791 --> 01:29:09,256
我們剛收到一通電報

1137
01:29:09,293 --> 01:29:11,192
有東西在水域上

1138
01:29:11,228 --> 01:29:15,095
可能是我們正在尋找的那架飛機，長官

1139
01:29:15,131 --> 01:29:18,900
把我們飛機所有的水、食物
醫療用品都找出來

1140
01:29:18,936 --> 01:29:20,905
誰知道他們在那裏漂流多久了

1141
01:29:33,095 --> 01:29:38,268
美國海軍中尉，安卓馬克思
兩個小時後

1142
01:29:39,157 --> 01:29:43,192
你是否也看到了？
到處都是人！

1143
01:29:43,228 --> 01:29:44,727
日軍一定是把船艦擊沉了

1144
01:29:44,763 --> 01:29:46,228
日軍可能還在那裏

1145
01:29:46,265 --> 01:29:48,669
伺機攻擊前來營救的船隻！

1146
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:53,070
那些弟兄現在需要幫助

1147
01:29:53,106 --> 01:29:56,404
長官，請求在海上進行降落

1148
01:29:56,441 --> 01:29:58,007
不准

1149
01:29:58,044 --> 01:30:00,444
飛機不允許在公海降落

1150
01:30:00,481 --> 01:30:02,416
損傷風險太大，你不能冒這個險

1151
01:30:04,450 --> 01:30:06,248
我偏要降落

1152
01:30:06,284 --> 01:30:08,318
我支持你，中尉

1153
01:30:08,354 --> 01:30:09,857
坐穩囉！

1154
01:30:21,803 --> 01:30:25,102
天啊，這些傢伙要在海上降落

1155
01:30:25,138 --> 01:30:28,071
我們快沒油了，長官
我們必須回去

1156
01:30:28,107 --> 01:30:29,843
10-4，飛回基地

1157
01:30:32,211 --> 01:30:37,348
他看到我們了！他看到我們了！

1158
01:32:26,497 --> 01:32:28,202
海上降落成功

1159
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:32,372
天啊！

1160
01:32:38,278 --> 01:32:40,611
先救落單的人，中尉

1161
01:32:40,647 --> 01:32:42,144
先救成群的人不是比較快嗎？

1162
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:43,947
是比較快多了

1163
01:32:43,983 --> 01:32:45,983
成群的人生存機率比較高

1164
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:48,952
嘿，小弟，你叫什麼名字？
這裏發生了什麼事？

1165
01:32:48,988 --> 01:32:51,321
布萊恩·史密斯威克

1166
01:32:51,357 --> 01:32:56,497
印第安納波利斯號－通信上等兵

1167
01:32:58,265 --> 01:32:59,528
注意平衡！放平！

1168
01:32:59,565 --> 01:33:01,265
中尉，機艙快滿了

1169
01:33:01,301 --> 01:33:03,001
機翼上可以再多坐幾個，機尾也是

1170
01:33:03,037 --> 01:33:05,569
我們可以把一些在機尾，小心夾板！

1171
01:33:05,606 --> 01:33:07,005
我們要回家了！

1172
01:33:07,042 --> 01:33:08,239
是真的嗎…

1173
01:33:11,110 --> 01:33:13,411
嘿，等等，等等！

1174
01:33:13,447 --> 01:33:15,046
那位是我們的隊長

1175
01:33:15,082 --> 01:33:16,985
謝謝你們…

1176
01:33:19,286 --> 01:33:21,985
願意…降落！

1177
01:33:22,022 --> 01:33:23,592
空間又多了一些出來

1178
01:33:26,093 --> 01:33:28,459
我沒事！

1179
01:33:28,495 --> 01:33:30,930
先救我的弟兄…

1180
01:33:30,966 --> 01:33:32,368
離開水中！

1181
01:33:45,613 --> 01:33:47,681
是印第安納波利斯號成員

1182
01:33:47,717 --> 01:33:49,950
不可能的

1183
01:33:49,986 --> 01:33:51,016
是不應該，但確實是他們

1184
01:33:51,053 --> 01:33:52,650
這可是一級事件

1185
01:33:52,687 --> 01:33:54,687
必須要有人出來，為此事付出代價

1186
01:33:54,723 --> 01:33:57,190
如果我是你
我會把我所有的船艦派到這裏

1187
01:33:57,226 --> 01:33:59,291
在鯊魚把他們全都咬光之前

1188
01:33:59,327 --> 01:34:01,294
我不知道飛機上還能再裝多少弟兄

1189
01:34:01,330 --> 01:34:02,394
你要用飛機載送他們？

1190
01:34:02,430 --> 01:34:04,330
你的飛機鐵定飛不起來！

1191
01:34:04,367 --> 01:34:07,000
你在開玩笑？胡斯
這架飛機被擊中，打到挫屎了

1192
01:34:07,036 --> 01:34:09,269
我們在水面上降落
我們很慶幸還能漂浮起來

1193
01:34:09,305 --> 01:34:11,737
你不願意派船來救這些弟兄

1194
01:34:11,774 --> 01:34:14,010
至少派一艘給我吧！

1195
01:34:17,582 --> 01:34:21,115
我無法理解
為何要花了這麼長的時間

1196
01:34:21,151 --> 01:34:24,317
最後，救援真的來了

1197
01:34:24,353 --> 01:34:26,586
轟炸機上沒有足夠的空間

1198
01:34:26,622 --> 01:34:31,560
來容納所有倖存者
但很快的艦隊就來了

1199
01:34:31,596 --> 01:34:34,997
巴塞特號(APD-73)，瑞格納斯號(DE-590)
塔爾博特號(FFG-4)

1200
01:34:35,033 --> 01:34:37,466
瑞吉斯特號(APD-92)，當費爾和號(DE-423)

1201
01:34:37,502 --> 01:34:39,304
塞西爾號(APA-96)，多伊爾號(DMS-34)

1202
01:34:52,449 --> 01:34:55,617
這正是我想要的

1203
01:34:55,654 --> 01:34:58,252
我們的英雄戰艦
在限定時間內送達炸彈後

1204
01:34:58,289 --> 01:35:00,721
於四天前沉沒

1205
01:35:00,758 --> 01:35:02,729
什麼？有多少人存活？

1206
01:35:04,762 --> 01:35:06,695
三百一十七名

1207
01:35:06,732 --> 01:35:10,565
八百七十九人罹難

1208
01:35:10,601 --> 01:35:12,635
有三次求救通訊呼叫

1209
01:35:12,671 --> 01:35:14,203
是從印第安納波利斯號發出來的

1210
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:16,071
這還不包括攔截的一則
來自日軍I-58潛水艇

1211
01:35:16,107 --> 01:35:19,074
也就是沈船事件始作俑著的信息

1212
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:20,575
王八蛋

1213
01:35:20,612 --> 01:35:22,712
日本現在已經頻臨投降的邊緣

1214
01:35:22,749 --> 01:35:25,516
有很大部分功勞
是在於印第安納波利斯號

1215
01:35:25,552 --> 01:35:28,551
我不想在新聞中
聽到任何沈船事件的報導

1216
01:35:28,588 --> 01:35:30,186
除非我他媽準備好了

1217
01:35:30,223 --> 01:35:32,721
日本鬼子投降
新聞會大幅轉播報導

1218
01:35:32,758 --> 01:35:34,657
用這些新聞來壓一壓沈船事件

1219
01:35:34,693 --> 01:35:36,560
還是有人會去調查的

1220
01:35:36,596 --> 01:35:37,794
畢竟太多人喪生了

1221
01:35:37,831 --> 01:35:39,363
珍珠港事件後
戰爭傷亡仍然持續

1222
01:35:39,399 --> 01:35:41,397
要質疑軍事政策的無能

1223
01:35:41,434 --> 01:35:43,566
現在還不是時候

1224
01:35:43,603 --> 01:35:46,271
或是你建議我們來控告那個渾蛋

1225
01:35:46,307 --> 01:35:50,406
不，我是說媒體與公眾

1226
01:35:50,443 --> 01:35:53,180
都希望找出禍首以息眾怒

1227
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:01,585
那我們就給他們一個人

1228
01:36:01,621 --> 01:36:05,156
我要回家！

1229
01:36:05,193 --> 01:36:07,195
我只是想回家！

1230
01:36:10,732 --> 01:36:14,433
醫生在哪裏？我需要醫生！

1231
01:36:14,469 --> 01:36:16,268
請你躺好，先生

1232
01:36:16,304 --> 01:36:19,572
信號兵，是的長官

1233
01:36:19,609 --> 01:36:23,245
你朋友有逃出來嗎？
就是那位跟你一起跳下海的男孩？

1234
01:36:43,932 --> 01:36:47,399
不知道是不是命運捉弄人

1235
01:36:47,436 --> 01:36:50,737
結果，我是唯一的一位軍官

1236
01:36:50,774 --> 01:36:52,806
僥倖存活下來

1237
01:36:52,842 --> 01:36:56,408
很多罹難者是我們親愛的摯友

1238
01:36:56,445 --> 01:36:58,478
那將會是你心頭上沉重的負擔

1239
01:36:58,515 --> 01:37:00,615
去告訴他們的妻子

1240
01:37:00,652 --> 01:37:02,716
你的丈夫為國捐軀

1241
01:37:02,753 --> 01:37:07,491
而你自己，上校，卻是存活下來

1242
01:37:09,661 --> 01:37:11,525
有人看到卡瓦諾嗎？

1243
01:37:11,562 --> 01:37:15,428
卡瓦諾有逃出來嗎？

1244
01:37:15,465 --> 01:37:16,864
斯坦迪遜呢？

1245
01:37:16,901 --> 01:37:19,438
加裏森，九點鐘方向

1246
01:37:23,641 --> 01:37:24,809
伸出你的手來

1247
01:37:27,478 --> 01:37:30,210
這是希歐多爾，你這笨蛋

1248
01:37:32,817 --> 01:37:35,384
你這個屎蛋！

1249
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:38,452
我們在一位陣亡的弟兄身上
發現你的書

1250
01:37:38,489 --> 01:37:40,388
我給了那位水手算是紀念他

1251
01:37:40,424 --> 01:37:43,325
我還沒準備好去見上帝呢

1252
01:37:43,362 --> 01:37:45,230
我好想念你們！

1253
01:37:54,273 --> 01:37:58,575
我在水溝裏…找到戒指的…

1254
01:37:58,612 --> 01:38:00,809
兩個星期前

1255
01:38:00,845 --> 01:38:02,582
你相信嗎？

1256
01:38:04,449 --> 01:38:06,249
謝謝

1257
01:38:06,286 --> 01:38:09,752
不要…不要感謝我
我原本要到這裏來

1258
01:38:09,788 --> 01:38:14,291
假裝要告訴你
我不知道這是誰的

1259
01:38:14,327 --> 01:38:16,693
但事實上我知道

1260
01:38:16,730 --> 01:38:19,795
我知道這是德安東尼歐的

1261
01:38:19,832 --> 01:38:22,869
我想要典當戒指來支付一些債務

1262
01:38:26,339 --> 01:38:31,942
我真的不是一般的混蛋，巴馬

1263
01:38:31,979 --> 01:38:33,714
我是特級大混蛋

1264
01:38:36,717 --> 01:38:39,015
對不起

1265
01:38:39,052 --> 01:38:41,323
我很抱歉

1266
01:38:53,567 --> 01:38:55,400
(一個月後)
戰爭結束了

1267
01:38:55,437 --> 01:38:58,736
原子彈投到廣島和長崎

1268
01:38:58,772 --> 01:39:02,007
日本已經向同盟國投降

1269
01:39:02,044 --> 01:39:04,476
我們送達的兩箱包裹

1270
01:39:04,513 --> 01:39:07,346
做到了毀滅性巨大作用

1271
01:39:07,383 --> 01:39:09,815
印第安納波利斯號的弟兄終於回家了

1272
01:39:09,852 --> 01:39:12,286
歡欣鼓舞的日子

1273
01:39:12,322 --> 01:39:14,020
盛大舉行的綵帶遊行

1274
01:39:14,056 --> 01:39:16,422
是對所有英勇的美國大兵
表示感謝及慰問

1275
01:39:16,459 --> 01:39:18,391
也對那些拋頭顱灑熱血

1276
01:39:18,427 --> 01:39:20,559
英勇的壯士，表示祈禱與祝福

1277
01:39:20,595 --> 01:39:22,665
並非所有人都是帶著好消息回家的

1278
01:39:31,341 --> 01:39:34,674
(莫比爾市 阿拉巴馬州)
對於他們來說，戰爭是真的結束了

1279
01:39:34,711 --> 01:39:36,777
媽媽！

1280
01:39:47,091 --> 01:39:50,424
但對我來說，戰爭才剛剛開始

1281
01:39:50,461 --> 01:39:51,524
我在這裏

1282
01:40:07,678 --> 01:40:10,412
我的兒子，我的男嬰

1283
01:40:10,448 --> 01:40:12,450
我再也看不到他了！

1284
01:40:35,708 --> 01:40:37,573
麥克維家

1285
01:40:37,610 --> 01:40:40,442
我希望你為了你做出的事付出代價

1286
01:40:40,478 --> 01:40:42,615
把電話掛掉，查理

1287
01:40:44,483 --> 01:40:45,885
下地獄吧！

1288
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:51,488
我們需要你走出陰霾，查理

1289
01:40:51,524 --> 01:40:55,726
我，還有你兒子…

1290
01:40:55,762 --> 01:40:57,827
我們需要你

1291
01:40:57,863 --> 01:41:00,497
很多弟兄也需要我

1292
01:41:00,534 --> 01:41:02,670
你已經盡力了

1293
01:41:12,779 --> 01:41:14,844
我聽說你得到晉陞了

1294
01:41:14,881 --> 01:41:17,415
我婉拒了

1295
01:41:17,451 --> 01:41:20,151
我準備搬到華盛頓特區
去讀法學院

1296
01:41:20,188 --> 01:41:22,687
甚至會幫助我的叔叔
在接下來的競選活動

1297
01:41:22,723 --> 01:41:25,857
好，祝你一切好運，布萊恩

1298
01:41:25,893 --> 01:41:27,692
這是你應得的

1299
01:41:27,729 --> 01:41:32,429
克萊拉，我…

1300
01:41:32,466 --> 01:41:34,867
我歷經了，一個人在海上

1301
01:41:34,970 --> 01:41:37,769
所能碰到最可怕的災難

1302
01:41:37,806 --> 01:41:39,604
我不知道後面的日子

1303
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:41,506
我得去面對克服他們

1304
01:41:41,542 --> 01:41:42,840
你看，我一直害怕

1305
01:41:42,877 --> 01:41:44,143
把我的生活安排得滿滿

1306
01:41:44,179 --> 01:41:47,078
我已經畏縮很久了

1307
01:41:47,115 --> 01:41:49,948
你怕什麼？

1308
01:41:51,886 --> 01:41:56,312
嗯，怕自己不夠優秀

1309
01:41:57,059 --> 01:41:59,091
還有

1310
01:41:59,127 --> 01:42:02,028
害怕被拒絕

1311
01:42:02,064 --> 01:42:05,832
拒絕？被誰拒絕？

1312
01:42:05,868 --> 01:42:09,002
被你，克萊拉

1313
01:42:09,038 --> 01:42:14,011
自從我們第一次見面
我深深愛上你了

1314
01:42:16,613 --> 01:42:18,078
所以我，嗯…

1315
01:42:21,083 --> 01:42:23,016
求婚？

1316
01:42:23,053 --> 01:42:25,752
布萊恩…

1317
01:42:25,788 --> 01:42:27,087
邁克和我有…

1318
01:42:27,124 --> 01:42:30,123
一個小孩，是啊，我知道了

1319
01:42:30,159 --> 01:42:33,159
但是，麥克就像是我親兄弟一樣

1320
01:42:33,196 --> 01:42:36,230
而寶寶需要一個父親

1321
01:42:36,267 --> 01:42:38,665
如果你願意嫁給我

1322
01:42:38,702 --> 01:42:41,506
那將是我莫大的榮幸

1323
01:42:44,242 --> 01:42:48,543
你不需要非常愛我
或是為我付出所有

1324
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:52,112
我們可能無法像你父母一樣有錢

1325
01:42:52,149 --> 01:42:56,250
但我們在華盛頓特區可以重新開始

1326
01:42:56,287 --> 01:42:58,520
我知道你已經有了一枚戒指

1327
01:42:58,557 --> 01:43:00,158
但我想二個肯定優於一個

1328
01:43:05,162 --> 01:43:08,062
他歷經了這麼多事
現在卻要被進行審判

1329
01:43:08,099 --> 01:43:10,165
聽起來他們正在找一個代罪羔羊

1330
01:43:10,201 --> 01:43:13,768
路易絲，這…事情很複雜

1331
01:43:13,805 --> 01:43:16,238
什麼事情複雜？上將

1332
01:43:16,274 --> 01:43:17,607
上校

1333
01:43:17,643 --> 01:43:19,207
你們想喝茶嗎？

1334
01:43:19,244 --> 01:43:22,210
謝謝你，路易絲

1335
01:43:22,247 --> 01:43:23,646
「撞到了潛水艇」

1336
01:43:23,683 --> 01:43:25,247
「該潛水艇發射魚雷」

1337
01:43:25,283 --> 01:43:27,282
「油輪的船員證實了這項說法」

1338
01:43:29,087 --> 01:43:31,153
「總統暫時不發表立即評論…」

1339
01:43:31,190 --> 01:43:33,924
查理，在他們看來

1340
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:36,893
你是在執行一項
由總統直接指揮的高度機密任務

1341
01:43:38,863 --> 01:43:43,633
上頭的行事命令就是
沒有任何紀錄說明戰艦到達天寧島

1342
01:43:43,669 --> 01:43:45,069
他們也會辯解說

1343
01:43:45,105 --> 01:43:48,543
沒有任何紀錄說明戰艦沒回到港口

1344
01:43:50,644 --> 01:43:52,207
所以現在要怎麼辦？

1345
01:43:52,244 --> 01:43:54,649
我有找外面的法律顧問

1346
01:44:05,026 --> 01:44:06,295
我接下來要告訴你的事情

1347
01:44:09,097 --> 01:44:10,898
千萬別讓第三個人知道

1348
01:44:17,371 --> 01:44:21,771
在你的船艦被日軍擊沉的四天前

1349
01:44:21,808 --> 01:44:26,110
還有一艘美國船艦在同一水域

1350
01:44:26,147 --> 01:44:27,583
昂德希爾號

1351
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:34,591
她也是被魚雷擊沉了

1352
01:44:37,359 --> 01:44:41,995
也就是說，應該為你們安排護航艦的

1353
01:44:42,031 --> 01:44:45,632
應該讓你們使用聲納探測系統

1354
01:44:45,668 --> 01:44:47,737
查理，我很抱歉

1355
01:44:51,373 --> 01:44:53,308
審判將在華盛頓舉行

1356
01:45:03,185 --> 01:45:04,652
夥伴們，這一杯敬…

1357
01:45:04,688 --> 01:45:06,853
我們終於回到陸地上了

1358
01:45:06,889 --> 01:45:10,023
敬，再也碰不到鯊魚

1359
01:45:10,059 --> 01:45:14,261
祝，我們的上校
在這場審判能一切順利

1360
01:45:14,297 --> 01:45:17,031
敬，所有在海上罹難的好兄弟

1361
01:45:17,068 --> 01:45:19,801
阿門，阿門

1362
01:45:20,837 --> 01:45:22,769
對不起，各位

1363
01:45:22,806 --> 01:45:24,138
有看到喜歡的東西嗎，阿爾文？

1364
01:45:24,175 --> 01:45:27,175
哦，不，是啊，不，我…

1365
01:45:27,211 --> 01:45:29,711
我認的出來你戴的戒指

1366
01:45:29,747 --> 01:45:33,280
但是，呃，是另一個戒指

1367
01:45:33,317 --> 01:45:36,283
我丈夫巴馬送我的

1368
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:39,057
你的丈夫，哦

1369
01:45:44,329 --> 01:45:47,695
你有什麼話想要說的，阿爾文？

1370
01:45:47,732 --> 01:45:49,764
他不是德安東尼歐的女友嗎？

1371
01:45:49,801 --> 01:45:54,302
是啊，曾經是，所以？

1372
01:45:54,339 --> 01:45:56,105
布萊恩他居然要娶

1373
01:45:56,142 --> 01:45:58,140
他兄弟已經懷了孕的女朋友？

1374
01:45:58,176 --> 01:46:00,176
那真是…

1375
01:46:00,213 --> 01:46:02,177
他是個好男人，比我還優

1376
01:46:02,214 --> 01:46:05,815
因為這句話，我要敬你

1377
01:46:05,852 --> 01:46:08,317
嘿，上校的審判九點開始

1378
01:46:08,353 --> 01:46:09,955
我們應該提前一個小時到

1379
01:46:12,524 --> 01:46:14,827
軍事法庭 華盛頓特區
1945年12月3日

1380
01:46:14,927 --> 01:46:16,293
長官！長官！

1381
01:46:16,329 --> 01:46:18,128
接受軍法審判
是在你的預料之中嗎？

1382
01:46:18,165 --> 01:46:20,897
長官，請回答問題！

1383
01:46:20,933 --> 01:46:22,465
對於你那些罹難的弟兄

1384
01:46:22,501 --> 01:46:24,171
你覺得是否要負起個人責任？上校！

1385
01:46:30,009 --> 01:46:32,876
麥克維上校，你被指控錯誤指揮

1386
01:46:32,912 --> 01:46:35,146
沒有採取Z字型航行
而危害到你的船艦

1387
01:46:35,182 --> 01:46:40,816
也沒有及時通知全體船員棄艦逃生

1388
01:46:40,853 --> 01:46:44,255
法庭上你要如何辯護
才會對你有幫助？

1389
01:46:44,292 --> 01:46:45,423
無罪

1390
01:46:50,030 --> 01:46:51,429
當船艦被擊中時

1391
01:46:51,466 --> 01:46:54,265
你有收到上校的任何命令嗎？

1392
01:46:54,301 --> 01:46:57,435
我跑去艦橋駕駛台
指揮官卡瓦諾在那裏

1393
01:46:57,471 --> 01:46:58,835
卡瓦諾告訴我，麥克維上校

1394
01:46:58,872 --> 01:47:00,973
下達了棄艦命令

1395
01:47:01,009 --> 01:47:04,009
但是你從來沒有
直接從麥克維上校接到命令

1396
01:47:04,046 --> 01:47:06,411
剛開始沒有，但是…
謝謝你，先生，這已足夠的了

1397
01:47:06,447 --> 01:47:08,485
沒有進一步的問題，法官大人

1398
01:47:14,957 --> 01:47:17,855
你為何不提出有異議？
軍隊中就是這樣下命令的

1399
01:47:22,463 --> 01:47:25,863
麥克維上校，請你告訴大家…

1400
01:47:25,900 --> 01:47:27,300
船艦Z字航行是你的命令嗎？

1401
01:47:27,337 --> 01:47:29,501
但對抗回天魚雷並不是那麼有效

1402
01:47:29,538 --> 01:47:32,572
是日本新的武器
一種由人操控的自殺式魚雷！

1403
01:47:32,609 --> 01:47:34,841
就像水下的神風自殺戰鬥機

1404
01:47:34,878 --> 01:47:36,542
看不到的東西是很難擊中的

1405
01:47:36,579 --> 01:47:39,312
那麼當天晚上呢？

1406
01:47:39,348 --> 01:47:41,881
盡快通過這片迷霧區吧

1407
01:47:41,917 --> 01:47:43,550
在霧散之後，再採取Z字型航行

1408
01:47:43,587 --> 01:47:45,052
現在全速前進

1409
01:47:45,088 --> 01:47:46,320
請告訴我們遇襲擊那天晚上

1410
01:47:46,356 --> 01:47:48,354
事情發生的經過順序吧

1411
01:47:48,391 --> 01:47:52,459
我們遭受襲擊
問題在於船艦受傷的程度

1412
01:47:52,495 --> 01:47:55,195
印第安納波利斯號是非常堅固的

1413
01:47:55,231 --> 01:47:57,430
她像是一個漂移的坦克

1414
01:47:57,467 --> 01:47:59,933
戰艦之前被攻擊好幾次
但我們都活了下來

1415
01:47:59,970 --> 01:48:01,302
所以我們必須對損傷進行評估

1416
01:48:01,339 --> 01:48:04,238
全艦戰備部署！
我們收不到通訊信號

1417
01:48:04,274 --> 01:48:06,941
求救訊號發出去了嗎？

1418
01:48:06,978 --> 01:48:08,509
傳令下去！棄艦

1419
01:48:08,545 --> 01:48:11,946
所以你下達棄艦命令
是在船艦被擊中

1420
01:48:11,982 --> 01:48:14,516
六到八分鐘之後棄艦！

1421
01:48:14,552 --> 01:48:16,852
你自己是如何逃出來的？

1422
01:48:16,888 --> 01:48:18,256
快，快！

1423
01:48:24,495 --> 01:48:26,231
有人聽到我嗎？

1424
01:48:31,370 --> 01:48:32,604
保羅？

1425
01:48:34,305 --> 01:48:35,841
保羅

1426
01:48:40,579 --> 01:48:44,647
當天晚上
保羅是我最後一次見到的弟兄

1427
01:48:44,684 --> 01:48:47,252
還有最後一次見到我們的戰艦

1428
01:48:58,331 --> 01:48:59,932
沒有進一步問題了，法官大人

1429
01:49:12,545 --> 01:49:15,979
我們請求傳喚唯一的潛水艇指揮官

1430
01:49:16,015 --> 01:49:19,082
當時他也在那裏
他也是這起事件的相關人物

1431
01:49:19,119 --> 01:49:24,621
美國政府傳喚日本帝國海軍橋本隊長

1432
01:49:39,174 --> 01:49:42,278
法院請保持肅靜，法院請保持肅靜

1433
01:49:49,451 --> 01:49:52,418
橋本隊長，你知道的

1434
01:49:52,454 --> 01:49:54,986
你是宣誓講實話

1435
01:49:55,023 --> 01:49:58,490
絕對坦誠，還清事實

1436
01:49:58,526 --> 01:50:01,627
但你不是基督徒，是嗎？

1437
01:50:01,663 --> 01:50:03,329
神道教

1438
01:50:03,366 --> 01:50:06,598
我們相信人死後靈魂的存在

1439
01:50:06,635 --> 01:50:11,371
是的，我理解真理和謊言的差異

1440
01:50:11,408 --> 01:50:14,106
非常好

1441
01:50:14,143 --> 01:50:17,315
告訴我們當晚你們的行動過程

1442
01:50:25,287 --> 01:50:26,180
看見船艦

1443
01:50:26,329 --> 01:50:27,213
準備所有魚雷

1444
01:50:27,372 --> 01:50:27,849
回天魚雷也要待命

1445
01:50:28,832 --> 01:50:30,664
看到船艦了，準備好魚雷
回天魚雷也要待命

1446
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:33,296
你有發射回天魚雷？

1447
01:50:34,145 --> 01:50:36,386
回天魚雷怎麼了

1448
01:50:42,757 --> 01:50:44,102
給我看照片

1449
01:50:44,311 --> 01:50:44,728
長官

1450
01:50:44,832 --> 01:50:46,813
你老婆與女兒的照片

1451
01:50:47,336 --> 01:50:48,899
給我看照片

1452
01:50:49,211 --> 01:50:50,359
遵命

1453
01:51:00,577 --> 01:51:02,142
關閉回天魚雷

1454
01:51:06,208 --> 01:51:07,668
準備發射魚雷

1455
01:51:18,377 --> 01:51:22,377
所以，印第安納波利斯號

1456
01:51:22,414 --> 01:51:24,246
是被傳統的魚雷擊沉

1457
01:51:24,282 --> 01:51:26,048
是的

1458
01:51:26,084 --> 01:51:29,619
在您看來
如果船艦採取Z字形航行

1459
01:51:29,656 --> 01:51:31,558
他們可以避開魚雷嗎？

1460
01:51:37,161 --> 01:51:38,527
不能

1461
01:51:38,564 --> 01:51:40,463
我們當時距離很近

1462
01:51:40,499 --> 01:51:42,433
我一共發射六枚魚雷

1463
01:51:42,469 --> 01:51:44,471
他沒有逃生的機會

1464
01:51:55,447 --> 01:51:57,418
沒有進一步的問題，法官大人

1465
01:52:03,290 --> 01:52:05,789
麥克維必須負責！
麥克維必須負責！

1466
01:52:05,826 --> 01:52:08,162
現在宣佈裁決結果，請起立！

1467
01:52:11,498 --> 01:52:14,364
首先，對於沒有及時下令棄艦

1468
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:16,333
造成錯過逃生最佳時機的罪名

1469
01:52:16,370 --> 01:52:17,734
我們認為被告

1470
01:52:17,770 --> 01:52:21,872
查理斯‧巴特勒‧麥克維 III 上校
無罪

1471
01:52:49,570 --> 01:52:53,339
這意味著什麼？怎麼了？

1472
01:52:53,375 --> 01:52:58,311
他們只宣佈無罪判決

1473
01:52:58,347 --> 01:53:00,446
由於沒有下令採取Z字型航行
置船艦於危險境地

1474
01:53:00,483 --> 01:53:01,913
被判錯誤指揮
有罪

1475
01:53:01,950 --> 01:53:04,517
他們以軍事法庭審判我們的上校

1476
01:53:04,554 --> 01:53:06,819
卻隻字未提那些死亡的弟兄？

1477
01:53:06,856 --> 01:53:09,259
他們應該為他建一座紀念碑

1478
01:53:11,661 --> 01:53:14,160
查理，我想讓你知道

1479
01:53:14,197 --> 01:53:16,132
對於這個判決結果
我深表遺憾

1480
01:53:34,652 --> 01:53:37,450
數百艘船艦在戰爭中被擊沉

1481
01:53:37,487 --> 01:53:40,321
而只有你受軍事法庭審判？

1482
01:53:40,357 --> 01:53:41,924
真的很糟糕

1483
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:43,495
謝謝

1484
01:53:45,662 --> 01:53:47,828
喔，喔，喔，那個人是誰？

1485
01:53:47,864 --> 01:53:49,801
那個人是誰？

1486
01:53:51,836 --> 01:53:53,701
給我幾分鐘時間

1487
01:53:53,737 --> 01:53:57,738
上校，上校
對於這個歷史上最嚴重的海軍災難
你有什麼看法？

1488
01:53:57,775 --> 01:54:01,213
上校…
你放棄選擇辯護律師的權力…
這是真的嗎？

1489
01:54:12,257 --> 01:54:14,360
（說日語）

1490
01:54:20,266 --> 01:54:22,899
這種事在日本決不會發生

1491
01:54:22,935 --> 01:54:25,467
如果角色互換

1492
01:54:25,503 --> 01:54:29,342
你不需為任何人的行為辯護
及遭受傳喚的

1493
01:54:30,744 --> 01:54:33,310
當時有什麼是我夠避免的？

1494
01:54:33,346 --> 01:54:36,312
你們暴露行蹤了

1495
01:54:36,348 --> 01:54:37,851
我們就在不遠處

1496
01:54:41,588 --> 01:54:44,989
身為日本帝國海軍指揮官

1497
01:54:45,026 --> 01:54:47,729
我的責任就是殺了你

1498
01:54:52,532 --> 01:54:54,369
但作為一個人…

1499
01:54:58,806 --> 01:55:00,642
我後悔我做過的事

1500
01:55:03,811 --> 01:55:07,915
我當時也很清楚
我們運過去的是什麼東西

1501
01:55:11,552 --> 01:55:13,022
我也是盡我的職責

1502
01:55:17,759 --> 01:55:20,959
但作為一個人

1503
01:55:20,996 --> 01:55:23,396
我覺得…

1504
01:55:23,433 --> 01:55:25,835
一點都不驕傲

1505
01:55:29,938 --> 01:55:31,704
我常常在想
如果我在你交付任務前

1506
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:35,412
阻止了你們
事情不知會如何演變

1507
01:55:41,717 --> 01:55:44,587
我們已經學會原諒對方
曾為昔日的敵手

1508
01:55:47,756 --> 01:55:51,324
但願有一天…

1509
01:55:51,361 --> 01:55:53,563
我們也可以原諒自己以前所做的事

1510
01:56:08,811 --> 01:56:11,878
人們都說我們贏得了戰爭

1511
01:56:11,914 --> 01:56:13,881
在我看來

1512
01:56:13,917 --> 01:56:17,517
當戰爭永遠消失，才是真正的勝利

1513
01:56:17,554 --> 01:56:21,689
就像海裏漂浮的倖存者
被自然分成幾種人

1514
01:56:21,726 --> 01:56:25,859
現今陸地上，也有不同種族的人

1515
01:56:25,896 --> 01:56:29,697
每年，我們這些倖存者
會聚集在一起

1516
01:56:29,734 --> 01:56:31,966
紀念我們去逝的兄弟

1517
01:56:32,003 --> 01:56:35,971
即使他們走了
他們將永遠與我們同在

1518
01:56:36,007 --> 01:56:39,107
我們新的使命就是努力確保

1519
01:56:39,144 --> 01:56:42,444
子孫後代永遠銘記在心

1520
01:56:42,481 --> 01:56:44,350
我們為自由所付出的慘痛代價

1521
01:56:52,657 --> 01:56:55,790
時光飛逝

1522
01:56:55,827 --> 01:56:58,897
最終我親愛的路易絲也離開了我

1523
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:06,102
那些與所有我們
在海上逝去兄弟的所有回憶

1524
01:57:06,138 --> 01:57:08,475
我永生難忘

1525
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:17,746
而電話

1526
01:57:17,783 --> 01:57:19,586
也永不停息地響著

1527
01:59:29,720 --> 01:59:33,288
第一天，我們大概有一百二十

1528
01:59:33,324 --> 01:59:36,324
到一百五十條鯊魚
整天圍繞在我們身邊

1529
01:59:36,361 --> 01:59:39,662
這是一個可怕的經驗，你知道

1530
01:59:39,698 --> 01:59:41,596
在水中

1531
01:59:41,633 --> 01:59:43,299
無法知道它們和實過來咬你

1532
01:59:43,336 --> 01:59:46,603
如果你攻擊那些鯊魚的眼球

1533
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:49,639
他們或非常吃痛，然後遊走

1534
01:59:49,676 --> 01:59:52,310
你可以看到在水面下
大約五十英尺的地方

1535
01:59:52,345 --> 01:59:55,045
他們會潛到那裏

1536
01:59:55,081 --> 01:59:57,047
痛苦地來回翻騰掙扎

1537
01:59:57,083 --> 01:59:59,014
每當他們說，該水域有鯊魚

1538
01:59:59,052 --> 02:00:02,718
我總是把我的腿抬高然後動也不動

1539
02:00:02,755 --> 02:00:04,354
我被嚇傻了

1540
02:00:04,391 --> 02:00:07,191
我看到這麼多鯊魚吃人的畫面

1541
02:00:07,227 --> 02:00:09,826
絕對不想自己也像他們一樣

1542
02:00:09,862 --> 02:00:11,861
你知道，我認為他們是可怕的

1543
00:00:45,673 --> 00:00:46,632
<i>Fire!</i>

1544
00:00:46,674 --> 00:00:48,259
<i>Fire!</i>

1545
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:54,890
- 11:00!
- 11:00!

1546
00:00:54,932 --> 00:00:56,267
- Fire!
- Fire!

1547
00:01:04,608 --> 00:01:05,901
Fighter plane to the bow!

1548
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:13,617
<i>- 12:00! 12:00! Fire!
- 12:00! 12:00!</i>

1549
00:01:16,746 --> 00:01:18,622
<i>- Brace for impact!
- Brace for impact!</i>

1550
00:01:22,752 --> 00:01:25,463
<i>- Damage report!
- Damage report!</i>

1551
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,923
Fire party to the bow.
Fire party to the bow.

1552
00:01:27,965 --> 00:01:29,258
Damage report now!

1553
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,278
Japs blew the crap out of us
at Pearl harbor.

1554
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,572
We cowboyed up,
turned the tables on them.

1555
00:01:51,614 --> 00:01:53,824
Ain't a whole lot of quit
in them either.

1556
00:01:53,866 --> 00:01:56,619
Gave as good as they got.
Iwo jima, okinawa.

1557
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,996
- Where's this all going?
- Mainland ground invasion's

1558
00:01:59,038 --> 00:02:00,915
only going to stretch
this war out even longer.

1559
00:02:00,956 --> 00:02:03,042
Truman's in his third month
as president.

1560
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:05,336
Honeymoon's about over.

1561
00:02:05,378 --> 00:02:08,547
America wants this war
to end and quickly.

1562
00:02:08,589 --> 00:02:11,384
Jesus, are you talking
about the atomic bomb?

1563
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:13,511
Send a message
loud and clear.

1564
00:02:13,552 --> 00:02:16,514
Drop it right on Hiroshima,
military target.

1565
00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:18,474
Ostensibly, yes.

1566
00:02:18,516 --> 00:02:21,519
But you'll kill every man,
woman, and child,

1567
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,521
not to mention
the radioactive fallout.

1568
00:02:23,562 --> 00:02:24,772
Even if the bomb works,

1569
00:02:24,814 --> 00:02:26,440
and there's no guarantee
that it will,

1570
00:02:26,482 --> 00:02:27,983
you can't fly it to Japan.

1571
00:02:28,025 --> 00:02:32,488
We motorboat the son of a bitch.
The tinian, philippine sea.

1572
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,697
With all due respect,

1573
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:35,491
we know their Navy's
stretched thin,

1574
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:36,951
but the Japanese
will spot a fleet.

1575
00:02:36,992 --> 00:02:39,787
Not a fleet.
No escorts.

1576
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,081
One ship, a fast ship.

1577
00:02:42,123 --> 00:02:44,458
Alone, unprotected.

1578
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,836
That's a damn
suicide mission.

1579
00:02:48,838 --> 00:02:51,006
But if it works...

1580
00:02:51,048 --> 00:02:53,008
They're heroes.

1581
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:58,431
Who do you have in mind?

1582
00:02:58,472 --> 00:03:01,559
"There will always be war

1583
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,646
until we kill off
our own species.

1584
00:03:05,688 --> 00:03:07,356
The difference
between us and them

1585
00:03:07,398 --> 00:03:10,526
is that we want to
do our duty and then go home.

1586
00:03:10,568 --> 00:03:13,946
The man who flew his kamikaze plane
into the bow of our ship

1587
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:16,490
knew he wasn't going home.

1588
00:03:16,532 --> 00:03:19,118
He was on
a suicide mission

1589
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,997
using his body
as ammunition.

1590
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:26,542
God help all of us
when we face an enemy like that."

1591
00:03:29,754 --> 00:03:33,132
"In a few days
it's my birthday.

1592
00:03:33,174 --> 00:03:37,845
My best gift would be
just to see you again,

1593
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:39,805

1594
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:41,140
Yeah.

1595
00:03:43,976 --> 00:03:45,561
- Paul?
- Sir.

1596
00:03:45,603 --> 00:03:47,855
Can you please get this off
to western union?

1597
00:03:47,897 --> 00:03:49,148
Aye aye, sir.

1598
00:04:02,661 --> 00:04:04,580
<i>So you been
sweet on this girl</i>

1599
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,124
<i>since the fourth grade and
you ain't asked her out yet?</i>

1600
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,751
You don't get it.

1601
00:04:08,793 --> 00:04:10,920
A sophisticated debutante
like her, hell,

1602
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,922
you wouldn't know
what I mean.

1603
00:04:12,963 --> 00:04:14,632
You have to prove yourself.

1604
00:04:14,673 --> 00:04:16,509
That's why I got to get
that promotion...

1605
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,511
<i>What, so she wouldn't
like you without a promotion?</i>

1606
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:19,929
<i>While you're plotting
and planning,</i>

1607
00:04:19,929 --> 00:04:21,639
<i>you know what's happening
out there?</i>

1608
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,102
<i>Life!
So live it, my friend.</i>

1609
00:04:26,143 --> 00:04:28,562
Holy smokes!

1610
00:04:28,604 --> 00:04:30,564
Daddyo's

<i>Judge bazemore.
How are you, sir?</i>

1613
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,785
<i>This here

1614
00:04:42,827 --> 00:04:44,578
<i>Hell of a place
you got here, sir.</i>

1615
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,622
<i>I was telling my boy bama,
it's like that movie,</i>

<i>"frankly, my dear,
i don't give a damn."</i>

Oh, forget it.
Mike d'Antonio.

1618
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,628
Good to meet you.

1619
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,171
He's from New York, sir.

1620
00:04:54,213 --> 00:04:56,215
Brian, why don't you step
into my office?

1621
00:04:56,257 --> 00:04:58,259
There's a gentleman there
who would like to meet you.

1622
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,678
Alonso, show Mike
up to the parlor,

1623
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,888
and tell those girls
to turn down that racket.

1624
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,604
Brian, is it true we might
be finally invading Japan?

1625
00:05:10,646 --> 00:05:12,773
Well, that has been
the rumor now for a while, sir.

1626
00:05:12,815 --> 00:05:14,608
They don't really tell us much.

1627
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,111
I've heard we have crippled
the Japanese imperial Navy.

1628
00:05:17,153 --> 00:05:18,946
Well...

1629
00:05:18,988 --> 00:05:23,534
<i>Much in large part to the men
of the USS Indianapolis.</i>

1630
00:05:23,576 --> 00:05:24,994
Hear, hear!

1631
00:05:24,994 --> 00:05:27,121
Do you think the war's
going to continue, son?

1632
00:05:27,163 --> 00:05:28,914
I don't really know, sir.

1633
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:30,499
Do you have a son
in the military?

1634
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,127
Heavens no, son.
He's got money in steel.

1635
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:35,046
That's right,
war is good for business,

1636
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:36,714
and business
is good for America.

1637
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:39,675
- We're proud of you, son.
- Thank you, sir.

1638
00:05:39,717 --> 00:05:42,595
<i>Five, six, seven, eight!</i>

1639
00:05:42,636 --> 00:05:44,138
You girls ready?

1640
00:05:52,772 --> 00:05:54,273
Hey, could use
a little help over here!

1641
00:05:54,315 --> 00:05:56,817
No, no, you go ahead
and make a fool of yourself.

1642
00:05:56,859 --> 00:05:58,069
I'm fine right here.

1643
00:06:03,324 --> 00:06:05,743
Your friend is teaching
the dance society girls

1644
00:06:05,785 --> 00:06:07,828
the latest dance craze
from New York.

1645
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,040
Not bad, huh?

1646
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:16,545
Whoo!

1647
00:06:19,757 --> 00:06:21,884

1649

00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,816
of a damn Rolls-Royce,
all right?

1651
00:07:18,858 --> 00:07:21,402
She's the crown Jewel
of the Navy!

1652
00:07:21,444 --> 00:07:23,320
Good job.
Good job.

1653
00:07:23,362 --> 00:07:26,657
Okay, we're gonna get this boat
looking brand-spanking new!

1654
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:28,701
Let them japs know
they didn't hurt nobody!

1655
00:07:28,743 --> 00:07:29,827
They didn't do
nothing to us, okay?

1656
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:31,662
Good job, sailors!

1657
00:07:31,704 --> 00:07:34,749
No holes in my shoes,
and no holes in my boat!

1658
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,127
Hey, it's going to take two
surgeons six hours

1659
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:40,087
to get my size-10 boot
out of your ass

1660
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:41,964
if you don't
get a move on, fng.

1661
00:07:42,006 --> 00:07:43,299
Means "friggin' new guy."

1662
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,384
- Sir.
- Carry on.

1663
00:07:45,426 --> 00:07:47,845
Congratulations, mcwhorter.
I heard the news.

1664
00:07:47,887 --> 00:07:49,764
- A boy right?
- Can't wait to meet him.

1665
00:07:49,805 --> 00:07:52,099
He's nine pounds and 13 ounces
of romping-stomping dynamite.

1666
00:07:52,141 --> 00:07:53,309
And the wife's fine, too.

1667
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,394
Outstanding.
How we doing here?

1668
00:07:55,436 --> 00:07:57,271
The japs put a pretty
big hole in the ship,

1669
00:07:57,313 --> 00:07:59,315
but the big guns
are fine, sir.

1670
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:06,822
Sir? Lieutenant standish
reporting for duty again, sir.

1671
00:08:06,864 --> 00:08:08,074
Ready to turn these sailors

1672
00:08:08,115 --> 00:08:11,660
into a lean,
mean fighting machine.

1673
00:08:11,702 --> 00:08:14,663
And may I say, my father,
admiral Percy standish,

1674
00:08:14,705 --> 00:08:17,124
<i>sends his regards.</i>

1675

<i>All hands stand by.
All hands, stand by.</i>

1676
00:08:43,943 --> 00:08:45,694
Looks like you got
the damage from that zero

1677
00:08:45,736 --> 00:08:47,279
- repaired pretty quickly.
- Yes, sir.

1678
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:48,781
We finished it today.

1679
00:08:48,823 --> 00:08:51,325
The fact that you lost
only nine men

1680
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:53,452
is a solid testament
to you and your crew.

1681
00:08:53,494 --> 00:08:55,204
Nine too many.

1682
00:08:55,246 --> 00:08:57,915
Ready to get
out there again, captain?

1683
00:08:57,957 --> 00:09:00,167
Admiral,
i have nine new officers

1684
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:02,253
and 250 new enlisted men,

1685
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:05,089
but we will press through
workup and be ready for sea.

1686
00:09:09,051 --> 00:09:12,138
This way, this way.

1687
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:16,058
Captain, president Truman
has chosen you

1688
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,894
to lead a highly
classified mission.

1689
00:09:18,936 --> 00:09:20,896
This is not
a combat mission.

1690
00:09:23,065 --> 00:09:26,193
<i>You will carry two pieces
of highly classified cargo</i>

1691
00:09:26,235 --> 00:09:27,987
<i>to tinian at best speed</i>

1692
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:30,364
<i>stopping only at Pearl harbor
to refuel.</i>

1693
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:32,825
You leave tomorrow.

1694
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:35,244
Where do we pick up
our escort?

1695
00:09:35,244 --> 00:09:39,915
Charlie, this mission could save
millions of American lives.

1696
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,127
It is top-secret.

1697
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:45,129
There'll be no escort.

1698
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,013
Does this have something to do
with the Manhattan project?

1699
00:09:59,977 --> 00:10:04,190
Open that tomorrow
after you've weighed anchor.

1700
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:05,983
As of 0500 tomorrow,

1701
00:10:06,025 --> 00:10:07,902
this ship is under
the direct command

1702
00:10:07,943 --> 00:10:09,528
of the president
of the United States.

1703
00:10:11,822 --> 00:10:13,240
Good luck, captain.

1704
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:27,505
Get your butt outta my seat.

1705
00:10:27,546 --> 00:10:28,881
Excuse me.
Sorry.

1706
00:10:33,052 --> 00:10:35,096
Look, look, look it,
that's that cracker

1707
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:36,555
that's been messing with you.

1708
00:10:38,224 --> 00:10:42,186
You told everybody
you was gonna whup his ass.

1709
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:43,854
What you gonna do?

1710
00:10:53,197 --> 00:10:56,283
What? Hey.
It's still a diamond.

1711
00:10:56,325 --> 00:10:57,827
I'll get her a better one
when I can afford it.

1712
00:10:57,868 --> 00:11:00,454
It's not about
the damn ring.

1713
00:11:00,496 --> 00:11:02,164
I can't believe you're
about to pop the question

1714
00:11:02,206 --> 00:11:03,916
in front of the judge.

1715
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,962
You even thought about this?
You've known her three months.

1716
00:11:08,003 --> 00:11:09,922
I thought y'all
were just having fun.

1717
00:11:09,964 --> 00:11:13,008
Oh, yeah,
we're having lots of fun.

1718
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,137
Besides, when you ever known
me to be scared of a judge?

1719
00:11:16,178 --> 00:11:18,305
You miss 100 percent...

1720
00:11:18,347 --> 00:11:21,475
Of the shots that you
don't take, yeah, I know.

1721
00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:34,989
Just don't forget to call them
"sir" and "ma'am," all right?

1722
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:38,117
Hey, you're gonna be
our best man.

1723
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:52,339
Mama, mama, yeah,
there we are.

1724
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:54,467
You have no shot.
No shot.

1725
00:11:54,508 --> 00:11:56,260
Double or nothing.
Double or nothing!

1726
00:11:56,302 --> 00:11:57,970
I'm telling you,

you know?

1728
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,307

I'm like...

00:12:33,297 --> 00:12:37,051
D'Antonio!
Daddy didn't mean it.

1742
00:12:37,093 --> 00:12:39,428
Yeah, well, it sure as hell
sounded like he did, Clara!

1743

Please, wait!

1744
00:12:45,643 --> 00:12:46,977
Mike!

1745
00:12:48,396 --> 00:12:50,231
- D'Antonio!
- What?

1746
00:12:50,272 --> 00:12:52,566
- Would you stop and listen to me?
- I'm listening.

1747
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:55,403
You need to give daddy a chance.
He just needs some time.

1748
00:12:55,444 --> 00:12:58,030
So you never told your parents
you were slumming it, I guess.

1749
00:12:58,072 --> 00:12:59,281
That's not what this is.

1750
00:12:59,323 --> 00:13:01,367
That's exactly
how they looked at me!

1751
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:06,122
A feisty young lady in red
pursued a sailor...

1752
00:13:06,163 --> 00:13:09,125
While another one...

1753
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,168
Seemed to pursue her.

1754
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:17,591
Come on! Come on!

1755
00:13:17,633 --> 00:13:20,428
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

1756
00:13:20,469 --> 00:13:23,305
Mess hall boy

1757
00:13:23,347 --> 00:13:25,307
They fighting!
Hey, y'all, they fighting!

1758
00:13:25,349 --> 00:13:26,726
That's not fair,
you can't hold that against me!

1759
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:28,018
D'Antonio! D'Antonio!
There's a fight.

1760
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,311
There's a fight.
There's a fight!

1761
00:13:29,353 --> 00:13:31,272

<i>Show him what for.</i>

1764

Which one of you wants
to get sliced open first?

1765
00:13:44,702 --> 00:13:48,289
You really need that thing?
I'm flattered.

1766

Little friend here makes it even.

Shut up, Quinn!

1769
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:55,796
Back up, boys.

1770
00:13:55,838 --> 00:13:59,091

You don't know nothing
about fair.

1775

You ain't on a ship now,
peckerwood.

1776
00:14:09,685 --> 00:14:13,564
If they move, cut 'em.
If you don't, I cut you.

1777
00:14:13,606 --> 00:14:15,149
Oh, yeah!

1778
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:16,317

<i>Yeah, knock him out, man!</i>

1782

Hey,
there's a fight down there!

1783

I got the colored fella.
I got the colored.

1784
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:41,592

1897
00:25:35,287 --> 00:25:36,914
Good work
on the guns today.

1898
00:25:36,956 --> 00:25:38,916
Thank you, sir.

1899
00:25:40,835 --> 00:25:46,507
What do you put in this
delicious pie, Theodore?

1900
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:48,801
I'm afraid that's
classified information, sir.

1901
00:25:48,843 --> 00:25:51,011
Set it down, imbecile.

1902
00:25:51,053 --> 00:25:52,263
Yes, sir.

1903
00:26:00,104 --> 00:26:02,189
Is it too hot, sir?

1904
00:26:05,276 --> 00:26:07,486
It's 42 seconds
on the big guns, sir.

1905
00:26:07,528 --> 00:26:10,197
Four minutes
and 36 seconds on zebra.

1906
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:12,283
- Run it again?
- Negative.

1907
00:26:12,324 --> 00:26:14,368
All ahead. Best speed.

1908
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,496
All ahead, bendix.

1909
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:20,374
<i>She was a four at port,
but she was a 10 on the ship!</i>

1910
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:22,960
Y'all are really lucky
i cut my right cross today.

1911
00:26:23,002 --> 00:26:24,253
Doing what?
Changing your tampon?

1912
00:26:24,295 --> 00:26:26,172
Yeah, laugh it up, ya mug.

1913
00:26:26,213 --> 00:26:28,924
Okay, $75, deuce.

1914
00:26:28,966 --> 00:26:31,385
That's another 50
to Sanchez, right.

1915
00:26:31,427 --> 00:26:33,220
25 to Quinn.

1916
00:26:36,057 --> 00:26:37,933
Shit.

1917
00:26:37,975 --> 00:26:38,934
<i>Anybody know
where we're going</i>

1918
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,853
<i>after we drop cargo?</i>

1919
00:26:40,895 --> 00:26:42,855
<i>All right, chowder heads,
who took my bag?</i>

1920
00:26:42,897 --> 00:26:44,523
<i>Nobody took your bag,
you idiot.</i>

1921
00:26:44,565 --> 00:26:49,111
Are you worth $850,
you shiny devil, huh?

1922
00:26:51,447 --> 00:26:53,908
<i>Alpha, Romeo, tango.</i>

1923
00:26:53,949 --> 00:26:56,994
Sir? Where are we headed
after the drop?

1924
00:26:57,036 --> 00:27:00,456
Not my concern.
Or yours.

1925
00:27:06,587 --> 00:27:08,172
<i>Hey, so what's
in the crate, huh?</i>

1926
00:27:08,214 --> 00:27:12,051
I hear it's toilet paper
for general MacArthur.

1927
00:27:16,013 --> 00:27:18,849
So why'd you join
the marines?

1928
00:27:18,891 --> 00:27:20,518
To kill people.

1929
00:27:30,027 --> 00:27:31,529
Your requested cereal,
chief.

1930
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:34,615
Hey, Lindy here
has a confession to make.

1931
00:27:34,657 --> 00:27:37,451
This asshole wanted
to join the army.

1932
00:27:37,493 --> 00:27:41,914
But he ended up in the Navy,
and he doesn't know how to swim.

1933
00:27:41,956 --> 00:27:43,916
I'll tell him tell him why
he doesn't need to know

1934
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:45,459
how to swim.

1935
00:27:45,501 --> 00:27:48,045
Because we won't be going
in the water, sir?

1936
00:27:48,087 --> 00:27:51,173
Hey, son, you any idea
how old the ship is?

1937
00:27:51,215 --> 00:27:53,968
It's 13 years old.
13 is an unlucky number.

1938
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:59,265
We have the unlucky privilege
of carrying god knows what

1939
00:27:59,306 --> 00:28:03,477
with no protection
across the ocean.

1940
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:06,939
So you don't need to swim
because if you go in the drink,

1941
00:28:06,981 --> 00:28:12,403
and the japs don't get you...
Here... the sharks will.

1942
00:28:12,445 --> 00:28:14,363
Sharks, sir?

1943
00:28:14,405 --> 00:28:16,365
<i>Si, señor,
the great white shark.</i>

1944
00:28:16,407 --> 00:28:19,326
Very top of the food chain.
No natural enemies,

1945
00:28:19,368 --> 00:28:21,996
an ancient killer left over
from the dinosaur age

1946
00:28:22,038 --> 00:28:24,331
when there was still a big
food supply in the water.

1947
00:28:24,373 --> 00:28:26,000
Go that way, you guys.

1948
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:29,086
Now up on the land
by some evolutionary accident,

1949
00:28:29,128 --> 00:28:33,632
we developed these big brains,
and we invented weapons.

1950
00:28:33,674 --> 00:28:36,427
So we got used to being
at the top of the food chain,

1951
00:28:36,469 --> 00:28:39,930
but once you step
in that saltwater,

1952
00:28:39,972 --> 00:28:42,933
right back to the bottom
of the food chain.

1953
00:28:42,975 --> 00:28:47,146
Even if you swim well,
we look pathetic to sharks.

1954
00:28:47,188 --> 00:28:51,525
They think were wounded,
split up the middle, you know?

1955
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:55,529
Five rows of dagger-like
teeth and jaws...

1956
00:28:55,571 --> 00:28:59,950
That can bend steel.

1957
00:28:59,992 --> 00:29:03,204
It's okay. Apparently,
we're not good eatin'.

1958
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:05,206
'Course, they don't know that
until they shred us up pretty good

1959
00:29:05,247 --> 00:29:06,999
and we're bleeding
everywhere

1960
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:09,502
and nothing turns a shark
on more...

1961
00:29:09,543 --> 00:29:11,045
Than blood.

1962
00:29:13,339 --> 00:29:15,091
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

1963
00:29:15,132 --> 00:29:17,051
I was sent down here
for an engine room punch.

1964
00:29:17,093 --> 00:29:18,594
- Xo send you?
- Yes, chief.

1965
00:29:18,636 --> 00:29:21,263
Yeah?
Look at that nose.

1966
00:29:21,305 --> 00:29:23,682
Look at that nose!
Look at it.

1967
00:29:26,435 --> 00:29:28,646
You can be thankful
you didn't get an engine room punch

1968
00:29:28,687 --> 00:29:30,356
- in the nose.
- Y-yes, chief.

1969
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:32,691
I wouldn't worry
about it, though.

1970
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:34,944
Our luck will hold

1971
00:29:34,985 --> 00:29:36,487
as long as we have
our little white dove of peace here.

1972
00:29:36,529 --> 00:29:39,240
She's our good luck charm.
All right, back to work!

1973
00:29:39,281 --> 00:29:41,117
Captain wants the boat
at top speed.

1974
00:29:41,158 --> 00:29:43,244
Chief, doves have longer
tail feathers.

1975
00:29:43,285 --> 00:29:44,995
That's a pigeon.

1976
00:29:45,037 --> 00:29:46,956
I know. My father
raises pigeons.

1977
00:29:53,254 --> 00:29:54,630

any unclothed women
in here tonight.

So keep it down.

00:32:10,349 --> 00:32:12,268
Alvin, I know
that's tough for you.

1999
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:14,854
Hey, I'm innocent as a dove,
father, you know me.

2000
00:32:14,895 --> 00:32:17,314
Thanks, fellas.

2001
00:32:22,153 --> 00:32:26,449
Admiral, I understand that
we are to sail to Leyte.

2002
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:29,410
Now that we have
delivered the packages,

2003
00:32:29,452 --> 00:32:32,580
can we please
have our escort?

2004
00:32:32,621 --> 00:32:35,499
Charlie, how can you
have an escort?

2005
00:32:35,541 --> 00:32:37,376
You were never here.

2006
00:32:42,631 --> 00:32:44,425
Go! Go! Go! Go!

2007
00:32:44,467 --> 00:32:48,345
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

2008

Listen up,
listen up,

2009
00:32:51,515 --> 00:32:54,602
hey, hey,
who am I? Huh? Huh?

2010
00:32:54,643 --> 00:32:58,189
Hey! I'll have y'all know...

2011
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:01,609
That I graduated second in
my class at the naval academy!

2012
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,694
Whoo!

2013
00:33:03,736 --> 00:33:08,616
And I'm going to turn you into lean,
mean fighting machines!

2014
00:33:12,244 --> 00:33:13,746
Attention on deck!

2015
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,915
Signalman!

2016
00:33:19,668 --> 00:33:21,921
Where did you
get that alcohol?

2017
00:33:21,962 --> 00:33:24,340
It's actually mine.

2018
00:33:24,382 --> 00:33:26,300
Is that so?

2019
00:33:28,469 --> 00:33:31,514
And that liquor on his breath?
Is that yours, too?

2020
00:33:35,518 --> 00:33:40,314
Swab up that giggle water.
We're shipping out!

2021
00:33:40,356 --> 00:33:44,235
There will be no Liberty!
We're received our orders.

2022
00:33:44,276 --> 00:33:46,862
And you'll all be on mess hall duty
effective immediately.

2023
00:33:46,904 --> 00:33:51,534
This isn't a minstrel show.
This is the United States Navy!

2024
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:56,247
And I graduated first
in my class, by the way.

2025
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:20,730
What in the hell?
That ain't your bag.

2026
00:34:20,771 --> 00:34:23,274
No, it's Alvin's.
I think he took the ring.

2027
00:34:23,315 --> 00:34:25,484
Hey, you're gonna
get busted.

2028
00:34:25,526 --> 00:34:28,529
I checked Sanchez and west.

2029
00:34:28,529 --> 00:34:30,656
Nothing. Shit.

2030
00:34:30,698 --> 00:34:33,743
Hey, thanks for helping me
out the other night with standish.

2031
00:34:33,784 --> 00:34:36,370
Wouldn't want you
to jeopardize your promotion.

2032
00:34:36,412 --> 00:34:37,997
All right, look,

2033
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:41,459
the whole reason
that this ship is on a course

2034
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,711
is 'cause they charted a plan
and they followed it.

2035
00:34:43,753 --> 00:34:46,714
So it's lucky Clara
didn't get a chance to say yes

2036
00:34:46,756 --> 00:34:49,425
because I'm incapable
of making a plan,

2037
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:51,010
incapable of supporting her.

2038
00:34:51,052 --> 00:34:53,345
I'm just saying maybe things
turned out for the best.

2039
00:34:53,387 --> 00:34:56,599
My plan is to find
the son of a bitch that stole my ring

2040
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,560
and marry her the second
i get off this ship,

2041
00:34:59,602 --> 00:35:01,729
and I don't care
what her parents or you

2042
00:35:01,771 --> 00:35:03,439
or anybody else
has got to say...

2043
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:05,608
You the kid
that does the diving?

2044
00:35:05,649 --> 00:35:08,277
Oh, you mean the all-knowing
Brian smithwick?

2045
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:10,488
Yeah, that's him.

2046
00:35:12,448 --> 00:35:13,949
Yeah, I do a little diving.

2047
00:35:13,991 --> 00:35:16,410
Okay, man, we want
to know about sharks.

2048
00:35:16,452 --> 00:35:18,954
I've been telling
Lindy here that sharks

2049
00:35:18,996 --> 00:35:21,290
don't really bother you
unless you're bleeding.

2050
00:35:21,332 --> 00:35:24,460
If you're bleeding,
it's a problem.

2051
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:30,966
I get nosebleeds.

2052
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:34,762
Captain's on the bridge.

2053
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,392
Captain, some of the men
are sleeping on deck again.

2054
00:35:39,433 --> 00:35:40,768
Let them.

2055
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,937
Their racks
are hotter than Hades.

2056
00:35:42,978 --> 00:35:45,398
- Visibility?
- Just this side of poor, sir,

2057
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:47,608
got a fog rolling in.

2058
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:49,860
Let's get through this weather
as quickly as possible.

2059
00:35:49,902 --> 00:35:53,406
Cease zigzagging until the fog clears,
full speed ahead.

2060
00:35:53,447 --> 00:35:55,700
- Aye aye.
- Standish.

2061
00:35:55,741 --> 00:35:56,951
Full speed ahead.

2062
00:35:56,992 --> 00:36:00,371
Full speed ahead, boys.
Full speed ahead.

2063
00:36:00,413 --> 00:36:03,040
I hear you put 24 men
on mess hall duty for a week.

2064
00:36:03,082 --> 00:36:05,835
Yes, sir, I'm gonna
write them all up as well.

2065
00:36:05,876 --> 00:36:08,379
The Japanese are extremely
disciplined adversary, sir.

2066
00:36:08,421 --> 00:36:09,797
If we are to defeat them...

2067
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:14,009
Sometimes it's better
to be respected than feared.

2068
00:37:06,729 --> 00:37:07,730
- D'Antonio.
- What?

2069
00:37:07,772 --> 00:37:08,856
Night watch
is that way.

2070
00:37:08,898 --> 00:37:10,441
- He took the ring.
- What?

2071
00:37:10,483 --> 00:37:11,901
<i>The engagement ring,
deuce took it</i>

2072
00:37:11,942 --> 00:37:13,486
when he pulled me
out of the fight,

2073
00:37:13,527 --> 00:37:15,488
- pickpocketing son of a bitch.
- Come on, deuce?

2074
00:37:15,529 --> 00:37:17,406
Ugh, you smell like
a distillery.

2075
00:37:25,915 --> 00:37:28,751
Might as well go on and admit.
You was scared, boy.

2076
00:37:28,793 --> 00:37:32,421
Scared? Of you?
You hit like a girl.

2077
00:37:32,463 --> 00:37:36,050
Next time I'm scared of a fight,
it'll be the first damn time.

2078
00:37:36,092 --> 00:37:40,096
Boy, you better be glad them mps
saved your ass from us.

2079
00:37:40,137 --> 00:37:42,181
Else we have to take you
like this chicken bone here.

2080
00:37:42,223 --> 00:37:44,183
Hey, Mr. big talk,

2081
00:37:44,225 --> 00:37:45,226
whatever you do
to that there

2082
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:46,685
flight deck buzzard bone,

2083
00:37:46,727 --> 00:37:49,563
that's exactly what
I'm going to do to you

2084
00:37:49,605 --> 00:37:53,567
when I get out of his cage
and I catch you alone.

2085
00:38:05,204 --> 00:38:07,123
<i>You suck that bone
like you've done that before!</i>

2086
00:38:56,172 --> 00:38:58,174
Lady luck
is a friend of mine.

2087
00:38:58,215 --> 00:39:01,260
Open up
and let it shine. Huh?

2088
00:39:01,302 --> 00:39:02,845
Yeah.

2089
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,932
- Come on, now,
- here we go, we go.

2090
00:39:41,884 --> 00:39:44,678
Ah, yeah, doc.
Okay.

2091
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,806
Yeah. Mmm.

2092
00:39:46,847 --> 00:39:48,849
Deuce, where's my ring?

2093
00:39:48,891 --> 00:39:51,143
- What the hell you talking about?
- Oh, no, you know exactly

2094
00:39:51,185 --> 00:39:52,895
- what I'm talking about!
- No, I don't know what you're talking about!

2095
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,234
Double or nothing!
Hey!

2096
00:40:05,282 --> 00:40:06,575
<i>Oh, my god!</i>

2097
00:40:12,373 --> 00:40:13,833
General quarters!

2098
00:40:35,271 --> 00:40:37,732
Out of the way!

2099
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:47,992
Report!

2100
00:40:48,034 --> 00:40:50,911
All comms are down, sir!
I tried to stop the engines!

2101
00:40:50,911 --> 00:40:52,747
- But I don't know if the signal went through!
- Stay calm.

2102
00:40:52,788 --> 00:40:54,248
Cavanaugh,
keep trying to get through.

2103
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:57,126
Standish, I want eyes
on the damage.

2104
00:40:58,919 --> 00:41:02,339
You heard the captain!
Go! Go!

2105
00:41:04,175 --> 00:41:07,928
Fire control, fire control now!
Hoses, starboard side.

2106
00:41:07,928 --> 00:41:08,929
Get that fire out!

2107
00:41:15,436 --> 00:41:18,314
Shut the engines down!
Shut them down!

2108
00:41:45,466 --> 00:41:46,967
Are we getting through?

2109
00:41:47,009 --> 00:41:49,678
Radios are down,
but I Jerry-rigged the wires.

2110
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,138
- You sent the sos out?
- Yes sir.

2111
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,681
Look at the needles.
They're moving.

2112
00:41:52,723 --> 00:41:54,683
Good work. Carry on.

2113
00:42:07,071 --> 00:42:08,906
Don't touch it
with your hands!

2114
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,827
I told you not to touch it!

2115
00:42:18,082 --> 00:42:19,792
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

2116
00:42:21,502 --> 00:42:23,713
We gotta go.
We gotta go!

2117
00:42:32,888 --> 00:42:35,474
<i>USS Indianapolis trying to
establish any and all contact.</i>

2118
00:42:35,516 --> 00:42:37,435
- Does anybody copy?
- Anything?

2119
00:42:37,476 --> 00:42:39,186
I don't know, sir.

2120
00:42:39,228 --> 00:42:41,522
- Keep trying.
- Yes, sir.

2121
00:42:41,522 --> 00:42:44,900
- Damage control.
- It's dead, sir.

2122
00:42:44,942 --> 00:42:47,945
<i>This is USS Indianapolis.
Does anybody copy?</i>

2123
00:42:47,987 --> 00:42:50,948
<i>This is USS Indianapolis trying
to establish any contact.</i>

2124
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:53,451
<i>Indianapolis, Indianapolis,
do you copy?</i>

2125
00:42:53,492 --> 00:42:54,952
This is Leyte.

2126
00:42:54,994 --> 00:42:56,787
- What's going on?
- Three calls, sir.

2127
00:42:56,829 --> 00:42:58,414
One caller identified
himself as the captain.

2128
00:42:58,456 --> 00:43:00,249
- I dispatched three tugboats...
- On whose command?

2129
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:02,209
Pull them back!

2130
00:43:02,251 --> 00:43:04,378
We don't send anyone out
until we get confirmation of their position.

2131
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,964
That could be an enemy sub
trying to draw us out.

2132
00:43:07,006 --> 00:43:08,215
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

2133
00:43:22,938 --> 00:43:24,982
We're not going to be able
to fight this one off.

2134
00:43:25,024 --> 00:43:26,859
She's going down.

2135
00:43:26,901 --> 00:43:30,071
Pass the word!
Abandon ship.

Abandon ship!

2204
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:23,015
This is not safe.
We got to get to the rafts.

2205
00:54:23,057 --> 00:54:26,894
Sir, are you crazy?
We can't leave this thing.

2206
00:54:26,894 --> 00:54:30,606
This thing's sinking.
That's an order.

2207
00:54:30,648 --> 00:54:32,191
No.

2208
00:54:37,655 --> 00:54:39,198
<i>Get Lindy in the raft.</i>

2209
00:54:41,826 --> 00:54:42,827
- Get him up.
- Come on, guys.

2210
00:54:42,868 --> 00:54:45,162
Like this.

2211
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:51,544
What sunk us?

2212
00:54:51,585 --> 00:54:53,671
It had to have been the japs.

2213
00:54:53,713 --> 00:54:56,799
They might still be a out there
looking to finish this off.

2214
00:54:59,051 --> 00:55:01,804
- Did the signal go out?
- It had to.

2215
00:55:01,846 --> 00:55:03,597
Someone will know
we're missing.

2216
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:06,809
They'll come rescue us, boys.
They'll come rescue us.

2217
00:55:18,112 --> 00:55:21,782
You guys okay?
The captain make it?

2218
00:55:21,782 --> 00:55:23,617
He went down
with the ship.

2219
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:29,123
Attention, men!
Attention!

2220
00:55:29,165 --> 00:55:33,753
If you are able-bodied
and in a raft, get out now!

2221
00:55:33,794 --> 00:55:37,548
The rafts are for
injured men and officers!

2222
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:42,261
Bring all of the provisions
over here now!

2223
00:55:42,303 --> 00:55:44,847
<i>- Grab my hand!
- I need help over here!</i>

2224
00:55:47,058 --> 00:55:48,642
Now!

2225
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:54,607
Get out of the raft!

2226
00:55:54,648 --> 00:55:57,026
Let the injured men
into the raft now!

2227
00:56:09,914 --> 00:56:11,540
Hold on.

2228
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:21,801
Captain.
Hey, you made it.

2229
00:56:21,842 --> 00:56:24,762
Campbell.
Campbell.

2230
00:56:27,056 --> 00:56:29,183
Medicine.

2231
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:30,976
I need it.

2232
00:56:31,018 --> 00:56:35,981
Hey... you made it,
captain, you made it.

2233
00:56:36,023 --> 00:56:39,026
You got some morphine,
huh? Hey.

2234
00:56:43,948 --> 00:56:46,575
You made it.

2235
00:56:46,617 --> 00:56:49,704
Okay... ah.

2236
00:56:53,791 --> 00:56:57,253
Ain't this a hell
of a damn note?

2237
00:57:08,723 --> 00:57:11,976
Gotta keep the leg elevated!
Keep it elevated!

2238
00:57:12,017 --> 00:57:14,770
Okay.

2239
00:57:14,812 --> 00:57:16,772
Don't go nowhere.

2240
00:57:16,814 --> 00:57:18,899
Sir, please
don't go nowhere.

2241
00:57:18,941 --> 00:57:22,319
- I'm not going.
- Don't go nowhere. Please don't go nowhere.

2242
00:57:22,361 --> 00:57:24,238
- How's my little boy?
- He's good.

2243
00:57:24,238 --> 00:57:27,992
- Yeah.
- He's strong, like his daddy.

2244
00:57:28,034 --> 00:57:31,620
He is? Don't go nowhere.
Don't leave me here.

2245
00:57:31,662 --> 00:57:34,331
I'm not.
I'm not leaving you.

2246
00:58:02,443 --> 00:58:04,737
<i>What I'm saying, fireplug,</i>

2247
00:58:04,779 --> 00:58:06,781
<i>is if you gotta
leave a woman,</i>

2248
00:58:06,822 --> 00:58:09,992
you always make sure
she thinks she left you.

2249
00:58:10,034 --> 00:58:11,952
Yeah? And how do
you do that?

2250
00:58:11,994 --> 00:58:14,997
That requires
a level of sophistication

2251
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:18,125
you have not yet
acquired, my friend.

2252
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,421
Calm down!
Save your energy!

2253
00:58:22,463 --> 00:58:24,090
Calm down!

2254
00:58:24,131 --> 00:58:26,801
You too good
to flag a plane, sir?

2255
00:58:26,842 --> 00:58:28,886
Oh, you think me waving
would've made the difference?!

2256
00:58:28,928 --> 00:58:30,805
I'll kill you!

2257
00:58:30,846 --> 00:58:33,474
- I will have you court-martialed, sailor!
- Go ahead!

2258
00:58:33,474 --> 00:58:35,476
If we get rescued...
And if we get rescued...

2259
00:58:38,145 --> 00:58:41,148
Let's all cool off!
We're going to get rescued soon.

2260
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:43,901
These men look to us on how
to conduct themselves.

2261
00:58:43,943 --> 00:58:45,820
We need each other.

2262
00:58:47,488 --> 00:58:50,324
I need to get the life
jacket off the doctor.

2263
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:01,043
Father, bless his soul,

2264
00:59:01,085 --> 00:59:05,172
in the name of the father,
son, and holy ghost.

2265
00:59:05,214 --> 00:59:08,342
How much longer are we going
to circle, an hour, a day?

2266
00:59:08,384 --> 00:59:10,219
Keep looking.

2267
00:59:10,261 --> 00:59:12,430
It's nine men lost on one plane,
lieutenant.

2268
00:59:12,471 --> 00:59:14,181
It's beyond a needle
in a haystack.

2269
00:59:14,181 --> 00:59:16,058
<i>Even with coordinates,
we barely have enough fuel</i>

2270
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,226
<i>to get back to base.</i>

2271
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:20,438
<i>Do you copy?</i>

2272
00:59:20,479 --> 00:59:22,481
<i>You got eyes
on that plane?</i>

2273
00:59:22,523 --> 00:59:23,941
That's a negative, sir.

2274
00:59:23,983 --> 00:59:26,360
Request a few
more beats out here.

2275
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,779
<i>Negative, you've been
out there too long as it is.</i>

2276
00:59:28,821 --> 00:59:31,365
<i>Bring it back.</i>

2277
00:59:47,882 --> 00:59:49,425
This way,
right over here.

2278
00:59:49,467 --> 00:59:50,926
Just grab on.

2279
00:59:55,014 --> 00:59:58,309
Quinn...

2280
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:00,353
Your head looks like
40 miles of bad road.

2281
01:00:00,394 --> 01:00:02,897
<i>We gotta get you
in the raft.</i>

2282
01:00:02,938 --> 01:00:05,441
Unh-unh, no.

2283
01:00:05,483 --> 01:00:08,235
Not with him, no.

2284
01:00:08,277 --> 01:00:11,238
Keep playing.
Keep playing.

2285
01:00:15,826 --> 01:00:20,039
Theo, what in the hell you
writing in that book now, boy?

2286
01:00:20,081 --> 01:00:23,125
"Dear mama, I should've
learned how to swim.

2287
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:26,087
But now my black ass
gonna drown."

2288
01:00:28,589 --> 01:00:31,258
What are you all laughing at,
huh?

2289
01:00:31,258 --> 01:00:34,303
We're all gonna die,
you know?

2290
01:00:34,345 --> 01:00:36,263
You know that, right?

2291
01:00:36,305 --> 01:00:40,226
I mean, the funny part is
you mess hall boys are dying for a country

2292
01:00:40,267 --> 01:00:43,813
that doesn't give a shit
about you or your people.

2293
01:00:43,854 --> 01:00:45,856
<i>Yeah, well,
i ain't waiting for no white folks</i>

2294
01:00:45,898 --> 01:00:49,276
or anybody else
to care for me.

2295
01:00:49,318 --> 01:00:51,946
I just knew the streets
of Detroit wouldn't.

2296
01:00:51,987 --> 01:00:55,616
I'm telling you, man,
I'd have died out there.

2297
01:00:55,616 --> 01:00:57,410
Same here.

2298
01:00:57,451 --> 01:01:01,497
The streets of galveston
killed my pa and my little brother.

2299
01:01:01,539 --> 01:01:05,042
Plus I wanted to get out
and see the world,

2300
01:01:05,084 --> 01:01:06,419
chase some foreign tail.

2301
01:01:08,462 --> 01:01:10,214
I second that.

2302
01:01:10,256 --> 01:01:13,509
Hey, you take notes.

2303
01:01:13,551 --> 01:01:16,345
Adventure, sex...

2304
01:01:16,387 --> 01:01:19,140
You put that in your book,
it'll sell like hot cakes.

2305
01:01:19,181 --> 01:01:21,475
We might even have
a new new testament!

2306
01:01:38,242 --> 01:01:39,952
What's going on
over there!

2307
01:01:39,994 --> 01:01:42,329
Get in the raft!
Get in the raft!

2308
01:01:43,497 --> 01:01:45,958
Get the men out of the water!
Get on the raft!

2309
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,921
Everybody out of the water!
Get out of the water!

2310
01:01:50,963 --> 01:01:54,091
<i>You men, out of the water!
What are you doing?</i>

2311
01:01:54,133 --> 01:01:56,343
<i>You stop swimming,
you get out of the water!</i>

2312
01:01:56,385 --> 01:01:59,055
Where in the hell's
he going?

2313
01:02:01,932 --> 01:02:03,225
What happened?

2314
01:02:37,176 --> 01:02:39,637
May the lord bless you
and keep you.

2315
01:02:39,678 --> 01:02:42,014
May he shine
his face upon you.

2316
01:02:44,392 --> 01:02:46,644
Amen.

2317
01:03:15,715 --> 01:03:19,093
Dear god, take my soul...

2318
01:03:24,265 --> 01:03:25,599
Thank you, god.

2319
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:43,200
Agh! Get off me,
god damn it!

2320
01:03:43,242 --> 01:03:45,286
- There's something out there!
- Sharks!

2321
01:03:45,286 --> 01:03:48,456
Theodore, Theodore,
have you see any other group?

2322
01:03:48,497 --> 01:03:50,750
I was in a big group,
100 or more of us.

2323
01:03:50,791 --> 01:03:53,127
- Which direction?
- That way!

2324
01:03:53,169 --> 01:03:56,047
Son of a bitch!

2325
01:04:02,261 --> 01:04:04,221
Peel that open
and inject him.

2326
01:04:04,263 --> 01:04:05,723
I'll just head out
a little ways.

2327
01:04:05,765 --> 01:04:08,100
I won't be gone long.
See if I can find them.

2328
01:04:08,142 --> 01:04:12,104
No, wait, captain!
Don't leave us!

2329
01:04:12,146 --> 01:04:15,024
Talk to him, distract him!

2330
01:04:15,066 --> 01:04:18,110
- Keep him calm!
- Wait, sir!

2331
01:04:18,152 --> 01:04:20,488
Sir! Captain!

2332
01:04:20,488 --> 01:04:21,989

gleam in his eyes,

- I'm reading.

2345

- What?
- Reading!

You're gonna have to do better than that.

Okay, okay!

- Do better than that.
- I'm sorry!

"The first time I saw her,

2350
01:05:38,232 --> 01:05:40,484
it was on market street
in San Francisco.

2351
01:05:40,526 --> 01:05:42,820
You could spot
her red dress a mile away."

2352
01:05:42,862 --> 01:05:44,572
Was it a tight dress or what?

2353
01:05:44,613 --> 01:05:46,782
Sure, sure,
tight dress.

2354
01:05:46,824 --> 01:05:49,785
So tight, leaving little
to the imagination.

2355
01:05:49,827 --> 01:05:51,495
Did you write that?

2356
01:05:51,537 --> 01:05:53,873
Yeah, it's my book.

2357
01:05:53,914 --> 01:05:57,543
That's good.

01:43:38,679 --> 01:43:43,476
<i>And since their orders were
to never announce arrivals,</i>

2827
01:43:43,517 --> 01:43:44,894
<i>they'll argue that they</i>

2828
01:43:44,935 --> 01:43:48,356
were not supposed to announce
non-arrivals either.

2829
01:43:50,483 --> 01:43:52,026
So what now?

2830
01:43:52,068 --> 01:43:54,487
I found outside counsel.

2831
01:44:04,872 --> 01:44:06,123
What I'm about
to tell you...

2832
01:44:08,918 --> 01:44:10,711
Can't ever
leave this room.

2833
01:44:17,218 --> 01:44:21,597
Four days before your ship
was sunk by the Japanese...

2834
01:44:21,639 --> 01:44:25,935
There was another us ship
in those same waters.

2835
01:44:25,976 --> 01:44:27,395
<i>The USS underhill.</i>

2836
01:44:30,564 --> 01:44:34,402
She was torpedoed...
And sunk.

2837
01:44:37,196 --> 01:44:41,826
Point being, you should
have had an escort.

2838
01:44:41,867 --> 01:44:45,454
You should have had sonar.

2839
01:44:45,496 --> 01:44:47,581
Charlie, I am so sorry.

2840
01:44:51,210 --> 01:44:53,129
The trial
will be in Washington.

2841
01:45:03,014 --> 01:45:04,473
This one right here, fellas,

2842
01:45:04,515 --> 01:45:06,684
is to being back
on solid ground.

2843
01:45:06,726 --> 01:45:09,854
To never seeing another shark again.

2844
01:45:09,895 --> 01:45:14,108
To wishing our captain luck
in this bullshit trial.

2845
01:45:14,108 --> 01:45:16,861
To all the good men
we lost at sea.

2846
01:45:16,902 --> 01:45:19,613
- Amen.
- Amen.

2847
01:45:20,656 --> 01:45:22,616
Excuse me, boys.

2848
01:45:22,616 --> 01:45:23,951
See something
you like, Alvin?

2849
01:45:23,993 --> 01:45:26,996
Oh, no, yeah, no I...

2850
01:45:27,038 --> 01:45:29,540
I recognize
one of those rings.

2851
01:45:29,582 --> 01:45:33,127
But, uh, not the other one.

2852
01:45:33,127 --> 01:45:36,130
I got it
from my husband, bama.

2853
01:45:36,130 --> 01:45:38,883
Your husband.
Oh.

2854
01:45:44,138 --> 01:45:47,516
You got something
you want to say, Alvin?

2855
01:45:47,558 --> 01:45:49,602
Isn't that d'Antonio's girl?

2856
01:45:49,643 --> 01:45:54,148
Yeah, she was. So?

2857
01:45:54,148 --> 01:45:55,941
I mean,
a fella married

2858
01:45:55,983 --> 01:45:57,985
his buddy's
pregnant girlfriend?

2859
01:45:57,985 --> 01:45:59,987
That's...

2860
01:46:00,029 --> 01:46:01,989
Well, he's
a better man than me.

2861
01:46:02,031 --> 01:46:05,659
Yeah, I'll drink to that.

2862
01:46:05,659 --> 01:46:08,162
Hey, mcvay's trial starts
at 0900.

2863
01:46:08,162 --> 01:46:09,789
Think we ought a be there
about an hour early.

2864
01:46:14,752 --> 01:46:16,128
<i>Sir! Sir!</i>

2865
01:46:16,170 --> 01:46:17,963
<i>Are you expecting
to be court martialed?</i>

2866
01:46:18,005 --> 01:46:20,716
<i>Sir, answer the question!</i>

2867
01:46:20,758 --> 01:46:22,301
<i>Do you feel
personally responsible</i>

2868
01:46:22,343 --> 01:46:24,011
<i>for the loss
of your men? Captain!</i>

2869
01:46:29,850 --> 01:46:32,687
Captain mcvay,
you're being accused

2870
01:46:32,728 --> 01:46:34,980
of hazarding your ship
by failing to zigzag

2871
01:46:35,022 --> 01:46:38,192
as an evasive maneuver
and failing to abandon ship

2872
01:46:38,192 --> 01:46:40,653
in a timely manner.

2873
01:46:40,695 --> 01:46:44,073
For the benefit of the court,
how do you plead?

2874
01:46:44,115 --> 01:46:45,241
Not guilty.

2875
01:46:49,870 --> 01:46:51,247
And when the ship was hit,

2876
01:46:51,288 --> 01:46:54,083
did you hear any directives
from your captain?

2877
01:46:54,125 --> 01:46:57,253
I went to the bridge.
Commander Cavanaugh was there.

2878
01:46:57,294 --> 01:46:58,671
He told me
that captain mcvay

2879
01:46:58,713 --> 01:47:00,798
had given the order
to abandon ship.

2880
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:03,843
But you never got the order
from captain mcvay.

2881
01:47:03,884 --> 01:47:06,220
- Not initially, but...
- Thank you, sir, that'll suffice.

2882
01:47:06,262 --> 01:47:08,305
No further questions,
your honor.

2883
01:47:14,770 --> 01:47:17,690
Why didn't you object?
That was military protocol.

2884
01:47:22,278 --> 01:47:25,698
Captain mcvay,
what, pray tell,

2885
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:27,116
is your theory
on zigzagging?

2886
01:47:27,158 --> 01:47:29,326
Not so effective
against kaitens,

2887
01:47:29,368 --> 01:47:32,413
it's a new Japanese weapon
a manned suicide torpedo,

2888
01:47:32,413 --> 01:47:34,665
<i>like an underwater
kamikaze plane.</i>

2889
01:47:34,707 --> 01:47:36,375
Hard to hit
what you can't see.

2890
01:47:36,417 --> 01:47:39,128
And on that night?

2891
01:47:39,170 --> 01:47:41,714
<i>Let's get through this weather
is quickly as possible.</i>

2892
01:47:41,756 --> 01:47:43,382
Cease zigzagging
until the fog clears.

2893
01:47:43,424 --> 01:47:44,884
<i>Full speed ahead.</i>

2894
01:47:44,925 --> 01:47:46,135
Tell us about
the sequence of events

2895
01:47:46,177 --> 01:47:48,179
the night you were struck.

2896
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:52,266
We'd been hit.
The question was how bad.

2897
01:47:52,308 --> 01:47:55,019
<i>The Indianapolis
is a strong ship.</i>

2898
01:47:55,061 --> 01:47:57,271
She's built
like a floating tank.

2899
01:47:57,271 --> 01:47:59,774
We had survived
multiple attacks before

2900
01:47:59,774 --> 01:48:01,108
<i>so we had
to assess the damage.</i>

2901
01:48:01,150 --> 01:48:04,070
- General quarters!
- We had no electrical.

2902
01:48:04,111 --> 01:48:06,781
Did you get the sos out?

2903
01:48:06,781 --> 01:48:08,324
Pass the word!
Abandon ship.

2904
01:48:08,366 --> 01:48:11,786
So you called abandon ship
about six to eight minutes

2905
01:48:11,786 --> 01:48:14,330
<i>- after you were struck.
- Abandon ship!</i>

2906
01:48:14,372 --> 01:48:16,666
How did you personally
abandon ship?

2907
01:48:16,707 --> 01:48:18,084
Go, go!

2908
01:48:24,298 --> 01:48:26,050
Can anyone hear me?

2909
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:32,431
Paul?

2910
01:48:34,141 --> 01:48:35,643
Paul.

2911
01:48:40,398 --> 01:48:44,485
<i>It was the last
i saw of my men that night</i>

2912
01:48:44,485 --> 01:48:47,071
<i>and the last I saw
of our ship.</i>

2913
01:48:58,165 --> 01:48:59,750
Nothing further,
your honor.

2914
01:49:12,346 --> 01:49:15,808
We wish to call to the stand
the only submarine commander

2915
01:49:15,850 --> 01:49:18,894
who is relevant to this case
because he was there.

2916
01:49:18,936 --> 01:49:22,064
The United States government
calls captain hashimoto

2917
01:49:22,106 --> 01:49:24,442
of the imperial Japanese Navy.

2918
01:49:38,998 --> 01:49:42,084
<i>Order in the court.
Order in the court.</i>

2919
01:49:49,258 --> 01:49:52,219
<i>Captain hashimoto,
you understand</i>

2920
01:49:52,261 --> 01:49:54,805
<i>that you are under oath
to tell the truth,</i>

2921
01:49:54,847 --> 01:49:58,309
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

2922
01:49:58,351 --> 01:50:01,437
But you're not Christian,
are you?

2923
01:50:01,479 --> 01:50:03,147
Shintoist.

2924
01:50:03,189 --> 01:50:06,400
We believe that the soul
exists after death,

2925
01:50:06,442 --> 01:50:09,070
and, yes,
i understand the difference

2926
01:50:09,111 --> 01:50:11,197
between truth
and falsehood.

2927
01:50:11,238 --> 01:50:13,908
Very well.

2928
01:50:13,949 --> 01:50:17,119
Tell us about your actions
on the night in question.

2929
01:50:31,175 --> 01:50:33,094
Did you fire your kaitens?

2930
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:22,184
<i>So the USS Indianapolis
was sunk</i>

2931
01:51:22,226 --> 01:51:24,061
using conventional torpedoes.

2932
01:51:24,103 --> 01:51:25,855
<i>Yes.</i>

2933
01:51:25,896 --> 01:51:29,442
In your opinion,
if the ship had been zigzagging,

2934
01:51:29,483 --> 01:51:31,360
would it have made
a difference?

2935
01:51:36,991 --> 01:51:38,325
No.

2936
01:51:38,367 --> 01:51:40,286
<i>We were too close.</i>

2937
01:51:40,327 --> 01:51:42,246
<i>I fired six torpedoes.</i>

2938
01:51:42,288 --> 01:51:44,290
<i>He had no chance to escape.</i>

2939
01:51:55,259 --> 01:51:57,219
No further questions,
your honor.

2940
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:05,603
Mcvay must pay!
Mcvay must pay!

2941
01:52:05,644 --> 01:52:07,980
<i>Call to order.
Please rise.</i>

2942
01:52:11,317 --> 01:52:14,195
On the first count,
failure to give the order

2943
01:52:14,195 --> 01:52:16,155
<i>to abandon ship
in a timely manner,</i>

2944
01:52:16,197 --> 01:52:17,531
<i>we find the defendant,</i>

2945
01:52:17,573 --> 01:52:21,702
<i>captain Charles Butler
mcvay III, not guilty.</i>

2946
01:52:49,397 --> 01:52:53,150
What does that mean?
What happened?

2947
01:52:53,192 --> 01:52:58,114
They only announce
the not-guilty verdicts.

2948
01:52:58,155 --> 01:53:00,241
He's been found guilty
of hazarding the ship

2949
01:53:00,282 --> 01:53:01,742
by failing to zigzag.

2950
01:53:01,742 --> 01:53:04,328
<i>They court-martial
our captain</i>

2951
01:53:04,370 --> 01:53:06,622
and didn't mention
all of our dead?

2952
01:53:06,664 --> 01:53:09,083
They should be building
him a monument.

2953
01:53:11,460 --> 01:53:13,963
Charlie,
i want you to know,

2954
01:53:14,005 --> 01:53:15,923
I'd rather this
played out differently.

2955
01:53:34,442 --> 01:53:37,278
Hundreds of ships
were sunk during the war,

2956
01:53:37,278 --> 01:53:40,114
and yours is the only
court-martial?

2957
01:53:40,156 --> 01:53:41,741
It stinks.

2958
01:53:41,782 --> 01:53:43,284
Thank you.

2959
01:53:45,453 --> 01:53:47,621
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who's that guy?</i>

2960
01:53:47,663 --> 01:53:49,623
<i>Who is that guy?</i>

2961
01:53:51,625 --> 01:53:53,502
I need a few minutes alone.

2962
01:53:53,544 --> 01:53:55,421
Captain...
Captain, how do you feel

2963
01:53:55,463 --> 01:53:57,548
<i>about this being the worst
naval disaster in history?</i>

2964
01:53:57,590 --> 01:54:01,010
- Captain...
- Is it true you were denied your choice of an attorney?

2965
01:54:20,071 --> 01:54:22,698
This would never happen
in Japan.

2966
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:25,284
If the roles were reversed,

2967
01:54:25,326 --> 01:54:29,163
you would not be called in
to testify on anyone's behalf.

2968
01:54:30,539 --> 01:54:33,125
Was there anything
i could have done?

2969
01:54:33,167 --> 01:54:36,128
You were exposed.

2970
01:54:36,170 --> 01:54:37,672
We were there.

2971
01:54:41,384 --> 01:54:44,804
As a commander
in the imperial Japanese Navy,

2972
01:54:44,845 --> 01:54:47,515
it was my duty to kill you.

2973
01:54:52,353 --> 01:54:54,188
But as a man...

2974
01:54:58,609 --> 01:55:00,444
I have regrets.

2975
01:55:03,614 --> 01:55:07,702
I had a good idea
of what we were carrying.

2976
01:55:11,372 --> 01:55:12,832
I, too, did my duty.

2977
01:55:17,545 --> 01:55:20,756
But as a man...

2978
01:55:20,798 --> 01:55:23,217
I find no...

2979
01:55:23,217 --> 01:55:25,636
Honor in it.

2980
01:55:29,724 --> 01:55:31,517
I often wonder
how things would be

2981
01:55:31,559 --> 01:55:35,229
if I had stopped you before
you completed your mission.

2982
01:55:41,527 --> 01:55:44,405
We have learned to
forgive each other as former adversaries.

2983
01:55:47,575 --> 01:55:51,120
Perhaps one day...

2984
01:55:51,162 --> 01:55:53,372
We can forgive ourselves
as men.

2985
01:56:08,596 --> 01:56:11,682
<i>They say we won the war.</i>

2986
01:56:11,724 --> 01:56:13,684
<i>In my opinion,</i>

2987
01:56:13,726 --> 01:56:17,313
<i>we'll really win
when there is no more war.</i>

2988
01:56:17,355 --> 01:56:18,856
<i>And just like there were
different groups</i>

2989
01:56:18,898 --> 01:56:21,484
<i>of survivors in the water...</i>

2990
01:56:21,525 --> 01:56:25,654
<i>There are different
groups on land today.</i>

2991
01:56:25,696 --> 01:56:29,492
<i>Every year,
we survivors gather together</i>

2992
01:56:29,533 --> 01:56:31,786
<i>to honor our fallen brothers.</i>

2993
01:56:31,786 --> 01:56:35,790
<i>Even though they're gone,
they'll be with us forever.</i>

2994
01:56:35,790 --> 01:56:38,918
<i>Our new mission
is to try to make sure</i>

2995
01:56:38,959 --> 01:56:42,254
<i>that even future generations
never forget</i>

2996
01:56:42,296 --> 01:56:44,131
<i>the price that
we all paid for freedom.</i>

2997
01:56:52,473 --> 01:56:55,601
<i>Time marched on,</i>

2998
01:56:55,643 --> 01:56:58,688
<i>and I eventually lost
my dear Louise.</i>

2999
01:57:01,399 --> 01:57:02,983
<i>And the memories...</i>

3000
01:57:02,983 --> 01:57:05,903
<i>Of all the boys
we lost at sea...</i>

3001
01:57:05,945 --> 01:57:08,280
<i>Never faded.</i>

3002
01:57:14,662 --> 01:57:17,540
<i>And the phone...</i>

3003
01:57:17,581 --> 01:57:19,375
<i>Never stopped ringing.</i>

3004
01:57:46,610 --> 01:57:49,613
♪

3005
01:59:29,505 --> 01:59:33,092
The first day,
we must have had 120,

3006
01:59:33,134 --> 01:59:36,137
150 sharks around us
all day long.

3007
01:59:36,137 --> 01:59:39,473
It's a horrifying experience,
you know,

3008
01:59:39,473 --> 01:59:41,392
being in the water,

3009
01:59:41,434 --> 01:59:43,102
don't know if they're
coming to get you.

3010
01:59:43,144 --> 01:59:46,397
If you hit those sharks
in the eyeball,

3011
01:59:46,439 --> 01:59:49,442
it really hurt them,
and they left you alone,

3012
01:59:49,483 --> 01:59:52,111
and you could see down
in the water maybe 50 feet,

3013
01:59:52,153 --> 01:59:54,822
and they'd go down there
and just thrash

3014
01:59:54,864 --> 01:59:56,824
back and forth in pain.

3015
01:59:56,866 --> 01:59:58,826
Whenever they said there were
sharks in the area,

3016
01:59:58,826 --> 02:00:02,496
I always pulled my legs up
and froze.

3017
02:00:02,538 --> 02:00:04,165
And I was petrified.

3018
02:00:04,165 --> 02:00:07,001
I saw so many sharks
eating men

3019
02:00:07,001 --> 02:00:09,628
that I never will
like them.

3020
02:00:09,670 --> 02:00:11,672
You know,
i think they're horrible.
