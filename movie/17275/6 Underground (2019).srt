1
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,148
What if I told you...

2
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,448
I know what happens when you die?

3
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:30,951
You become a ghost...

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,910
trapped in a shadowland.

5
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,245
A world of whispers,

6
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,080
invisible except to other ghosts.

7
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,627
Orphaned,

8
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,669
unable to return to those you loved.

9
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,098
But with loneliness...

10
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,610
comes freedom...

11
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,155
...to go where you please.

12
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,951
Do what you want.

13
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:30,008
Ghosts have one power above all others:

14
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,471
to haunt the living.

15
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:36,925
Haunt them...

16
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,812
for what they've done.

17
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,373
345-Tango-Tango.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Tango-Tango, we have engine failure.

19
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:11,835
Shit, shit, shit!

20
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,133
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

21
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,336
Going down!

22
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,896
This is the day I died three years ago...

23
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,443
as far as anyone else knows.

24
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,857
There was no eulogy. No wake.

25
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,200
I became a ghost.

26
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,030
But this isn't where the story
really starts. No, no.

27
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,197
That was four months ago,
on my team's first mission.

28
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,751
And that was a glorious clusterfuck.

29
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,003
- It didn't fucking work!
- One? Five for One.

30
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,666
God, I hate these numbers.

31
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,816
- They're for your own safety.
- Get in the car.

32
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,550
She's, uh, she's bleeding.

33
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,233
- I'm aware.
- Drive!

34
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,101
Gonna smoke these motherfuckers!

35
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,305
They're shooting at us!

36
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,438
Go, go, go!

37
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,359
- We're gonna need a hospital.
- Getting a little tense in here.

38
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,377
Where did the guys come from?

39
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,604
- You said you were covering the door.
- I was covering the door.

40
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,397
- You were shot through a window!
- Such an amateur show.

41
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,761
- Oh, an amateur show?
- Yeah!

42
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,549
I know, you got shot through the window.
God, that's so bad.

43
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,861
What lawyer has this many guards?

44
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,755
You're definitely gonna die.

45
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,894
I don't know,
a lawyer with friends in high places.

46
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,851
- Mafia friends or something.
- Mafia?

47
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,352
The point is we got this.
That's all that matters.

48
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,444
- Yeah. What's that?
- It's... It's disturbing.

49
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,018
Gonna hurt, okay?

50
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,065
I'm gonna go in really deep
and find that bullet.

51
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,819
No, no, no. Don't.
No, you're not gonna put that in her.

52
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,532
Oh, I'm in. Feel that?

53
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,293
- Shit.
- Oh, God. There it goes.

54
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,155
Oh, that's so gross.

55
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,002
- Oh, I'm gonna yak.
- We got a tail.

56
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,866
Stop playing with your fucking gun,
and let me work.

57
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,035
Shut up. You wanna die?

58
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,206
Hey, I think they got us. You wanna...

59
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,502
Yeah, here we go. Hang on.

60
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,499
Okay.

61
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,470
It's a little tight.

62
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,715
Watch out!

63
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,230
What did you guys do in there?
Why are you covered in blood?

64
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:38,736
The head, neck, and face
are very vascular, so it's a lot of blood.

65
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,912
Oh, please tell me
you didn't kill a mafia guy in Italy!

66
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,914
Fuck... off.

67
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,827
No.

68
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,955
I'm trying to help you here.

69
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:54,208
And anything beyond a simple "yes"
is gonna just super suck for your face.

70
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:58,007
Look, your client is a half-wit,
fuckstain war criminal.

71
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,169
Why are you protecting him?

72
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,715
My client has never ordered
any gas attacks.

73
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,351
No, he's ordered the four generals that
work for him to order the gas attacks.

74
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,760
Just get him on the phone.

75
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,805
Let's just fucking get nuts.

76
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:09,891
What do you say?

77
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,734
Client privilege.

78
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,481
You're gonna be a pirate.

79
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,477
- This is getting blood on my car.
- Shut up!

80
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,726
There's a BMW chasing us.

81
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,331
Can I take a moment to thank you?

82
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,333
There is nothing else I'd rather be doing
with my life.

83
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,674
I don't care.

84
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,594
Go, go!

85
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,518
Whoo!

86
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,111
Oh, nuns, of course.

87
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,740
They'll forgive me.

88
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,571
What the fuck?

89
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,914
Watch out for that...

90
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,622
Ohhh...

91
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,495
Oh, I so had the right of way.

92
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,132
You hit one more person, and I'm walking.

93
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,511
- You hear that?
- A lot of backseat-driving going on.

94
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,020
Nice call on the Day-Glo green.

95
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,310
- Is it too flashy?
- Blends into the Italian architecture.

96
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,456
- What, you don't like this color?
- Baby, baby!

97
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,980
Baby... Baby... Baby...

98
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,494
No, no, no, no! Puppies!

99
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,542
Fuck!

100
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,206
She's fine. She's fine.

101
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,013
Uh, he's got a gun.

102
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,729
- Move!
- What?

103
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,572
- Jesus! Shoot him!
- Go get him!

104
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,449
Do it!

105
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,795
She okay?

106
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,467
- She's lost a shit ton of blood.
- This isn't a shit ton.

107
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,030
Oh, it's leaking under my seat!

108
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:52,893
I am judge of what's a shit ton.
You see? Blood. Red.

109
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,062
Can you just staunch it
or whatever the fuck you call it?

110
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,942
I can actually hear it pumping out.

111
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,611
She squirted.

112
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,959
- That was literal... She squirted.
- That's a lot of blood!

113
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,463
Tell me that didn't go in your mouth.

114
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,052
Guess this happens when you try to steal
a whole country. Right, One?

115
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,866
Yeah, we could have used
a warm-up mission.

116
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,293
Yeah, that's my problem.
I'm just getting warmed up.

117
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,967
Oh! Fuck!

118
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,052
Oh!

119
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,097
Why is everyone on a fucking Vespa?

120
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,231
Whoa.

121
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,483
God, I love Italy.

122
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,949
I'm starting to feel it.

123
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,949
I'm feeling fucking carsick.

124
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,705
One for Four?

125
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,967
Yeah, go for Four.

126
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,048
We need you.

127
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,429
'Course you need me.

128
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,509
I'm here.

129
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,933
Remind me, where the fuck is "here?"

130
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,312
"Here" here. Like, here?

131
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,679
Specificity.

132
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,237
Here. Right effin' here!

133
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,068
Top of the Duomo, like we talked about.

134
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,028
Look up.

135
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,116
Where you going?

136
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,583
Oh, shit.

137
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,001
Coming down.

138
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,274
I see you.

139
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,607
Punch up. Pit maneuver!

140
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,751
Right over you!

141
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,388
Coming north. Down on Via de... Via de...

142
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,530
There's so many fucking vias in Italy.

143
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,680
Wrong way!

144
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,774
Come back. I've got an idea.

145
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,194
Round the corner.

146
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,874
That's it. Keep coming, keep coming.

147
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,633
Six, you see that?

148
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,585
- That's called "skill."
- Oh!

149
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,759
Who knew the optic nerve was so long?

150
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,934
Surprised his asshole didn't come with it.

151
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,601
This isn't gonna work. Pull over there.

152
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,823
Ah! What the fuck, dude?

153
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,150
- Aargh! No!
- Okay. Don't...

154
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,279
Don't you squish it, you motherfucker!

155
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,221
- Grab it! Got it?
- I'm fucking serious!

156
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,418
- You squish it, the mission's over!
- Get it!

157
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,708
- Dude, come on!
- Got it!

158
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,304
- Oh, fuck me!
- Got it!

159
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,879
- Toss it! Toss it!
- Keep your goddamn eye on the road!

160
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,296
This is so stressful.

161
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,595
- Whose eye is that?
- It's... It's the lawyer's.

162
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:12,114
- Did you just scoop it out, or...
- God, no! I didn't scoop it out.

163
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,399
Two did.

164
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,032
Okay, here we go.

165
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:16,991
All right.

166
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,827
Okay. All of Rovach's transmissions.

167
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,007
Gonna lead us straight
to the four generals.

168
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,770
- I'm getting light-headed.
- You're not the one holding it.

169
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,844
You got the generals? Can I go?

170
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,551
Cop.

171
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,221
- Cop.
- Don't you move.

172
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,470
There's a cop looking right at us.

173
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,191
Go, guy. Go, go, go, go!

174
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,796
You gotta lose that police chopper.

175
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,786
Buongiorno, Uno.

176
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,153
Yeah, hey. Shit's gone...
We're super fucked.

177
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,269
Well, I could probably point you
to il bagno.

178
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,253
Whatever. Four needs an Uber.

179
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,507
Way ahead of you, papi.

180
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,972
Buongiorno, Quattro.

181
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,052
Go, go, go!

182
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,597
I'm gonna send new exfil.

183
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,522
As soon as we get clear, lose the chopper.
Can you do that?

184
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,232
- Lose the chopper?
- "Can I lose the chopper?"

185
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,236
Go, go, go, go, go!

186
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,615
- Shit! Shit!
- Fucking drive!

187
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:50,703
You fucking drive!

188
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,250
Get down.

189
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,636
- Is your arm hurt?
- What? You wanna fucking shoot?

190
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,928
Then can you use it to shoot back?

191
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,017
- You seeing that? You seeing that?
- Yes! Yes!

192
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,645
Don't tell me my job.

193
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,195
- Hey, remember the Uffizi?
- Fuck, no.

194
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,423
It's the museum next to where
we got those mochaccinos.

195
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:28,077
I remember the mochaccinos!
I'm saying fuck, no!

196
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,389
Punch him.

197
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,824
Sorry for yelling.

198
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,402
Mind if I turn on some music?

199
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,093
Just watch out for the people!

200
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,344
Okay, where in the fuck is the front door?

201
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,887
Gun! Gun, gun, gun, gun!

202
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,112
Two!

203
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,253
Oh, fuck!

204
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,335
Glad you're on the team.

205
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
Me too.

206
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,968
You said whatever I need to do,
right? So, I'm just gonna do it.

207
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,601
- We're definitely gonna be on the news.
- No shit. Hang on.

208
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,737
Shit!

209
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,078
Ah, shit!

210
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,921
No, no, no, no, no!

211
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,036
That was Apollo and Daphne!

212
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,433
You see any choppers?
I don't see any choppers.

213
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,269
Three, lost the chopper.

214
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,661
Not the David. No! Not the David,
not the David, not the...

215
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,225
Is the David the one
with the really small...

216
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,442
Yep, that's it.

217
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,577
You wanna get out and compare,
or should we maybe think about going?

218
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,858
- No. I'm good.
- Yep. Let's go.

219
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:08,993
Go!

220
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,370
Oh, shit!
Two black Suburbans coming your way.

221
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,083
Six, fake 'em out. I'm coming to you.

222
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,961
Go, go, go, go, go!

223
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,456
They're expecting, "Go, go, go!"

224
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,412
You got a superhero on the squad!

225
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,539
I don't speak that.

226
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,426
Shit's about to get crazy.

227
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,596
Now? I'm conducting surgery.

228
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:25,205
- I'm trying to lose a thousand cars.
- She's gonna die, you know?

229
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,559
You can live for days with a gunshot wound
in the stomach.

230
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,208
She'll be fine.

231
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,573
No. Don't speak that either.

232
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,694
Up top!

233
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,624
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!
- Whoa.

234
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,367
Oh, I feel it, I feel it.

235
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,576
I got it, I got it.

236
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,668
Yeah!

237
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,922
Oh, I feel so much better now.

238
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,174
I got it, baby!

239
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,359
Yes! Now, that's driving! That's driving!

240
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,815
What the heck?

241
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,238
I can't see!

242
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,028
Whoa, shit!

243
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,410
Oh, shit!

244
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,840
Okay.

245
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,510
Okay.

246
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,595
Come on.

247
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,638
Go, go, go!

248
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,772
Where's...

249
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,714
Here's a toast to a kid I liked.

250
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,459
Are you crying?

251
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,511
We didn't even know his name.

252
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,340
We don't know any names.

253
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,969
What was his name?

254
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,603
It doesn't matter.

255
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,433
He was a good man.

256
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,738
Thought I managed the risk. I'm sorry.

257
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,158
Did he have a family?

258
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,698
I think you're looking at it.

259
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,445
All of us.

260
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,252
We're not a family.

261
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,376
Not the Cleavers.

262
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:57,708
What?

263
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,878
The Cleavers.

264
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,175
Ward, June?

265
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,737
- What? No.
- Leave It to Beaver.

266
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,721
- Leave It to Beaver?
- Jerry Mathers?

267
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:05,852
- No.
- Tony Dow?

268
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,181
- No.
- Barbara Billingsley, Hugh Beaumont?

269
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,667
- Never heard of it.
- No? Nobody watches Nick at Nite?

270
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,107
The French don't watch shit like that.

271
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,818
Millennials, French people.
Let's just grab the head.

272
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,399
What does this mean?

273
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,949
It means we find a Seven.

274
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,495
Central, Aid and Base.

275
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,506
Aid and Base, this is Central.
The net is yours.

276
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,992
Jackpot.

277
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,623
Don't be afraid now,
I'm gonna put my foot...

278
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,337
- Whoa!
- We'll be quiet for a second.

279
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,841
Do you hear any noise?

280
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,052
- Zero.
- Zero.

281
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,061
Hey. Whoa!

282
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,639
Whoa, hey, hey!

283
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,433
We got a van stepping out.
United Nations.

284
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,227
ISR is approaching coordinates.

285
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,112
Black Hawk, got eyes on the white van?

286
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,650
He looks agitated, man. Something's wrong.

287
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,574
He's headed for my guys,
and I don't like it.

288
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,492
I said he is headed for my guys.

289
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,321
My guys...

290
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,462
Looks like the letters are backwards.

291
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:00,548
I said the UN is backwards.
Request permission to fire.

292
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,815
Maybe you haven't heard,
we're spectators here.

293
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,799
- Commander...
- Unless you wanna

294
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:08,391
suck on a court-martial, I suggest
you pull up a chair and spectate.

295
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,347
The van! The van!

296
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,850
RPG!

297
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,534
Dear mister and missus,

298
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,840
you may not know me,

299
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:52,932
but Johnny's one of my Delta brothers;
a friend.

300
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,151
Welcome home, Blaine.

301
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,408
We've been looking for a special operator
like you for a while.

302
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,986
Who are you?

303
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,410
I'm somebody who'd have let you
pull the trigger.

304
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:18,914
Excuse me?

305
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:23,964
I listened to your call.

306
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,758
Never mind how.

307
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,970
I would've let you pull that trigger.

308
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,307
Can I come in?

309
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,145
Thank you.

310
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,815
Nobody's gonna save the world.

311
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,867
But we can make it a little less shitty,
you know?

312
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,242
And I'm the guy who can help you do that.

313
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,736
You wonder what it would be like

314
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,500
if you could do the job
that you were put on this Earth to do?

315
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,127
Hmm?

316
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:10,048
You could take out some truly evil people.

317
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,345
Not people that the government tells you
are evil,

318
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:17,807
because based on, you know,
policies or politics and bureaucracy

319
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,561
or trade relations or any of that shit.

320
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:26,073
No, I'm talking truly world-class
evil motherfuckers.

321
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,740
I can help you go after those guys.

322
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:36,159
And I will never tell you
to not pull that trigger.

323
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,748
What would you say to that?

324
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,140
Hey, kid!

325
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,040
- Hey, what's that guy doing?
- Don't do it!

326
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,064
Hey!

327
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,073
Man overboard!

328
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,743
Blaine was a born operator,

329
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,866
a fourth-generation soldier.

330
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,250
As a matter of fact, his family fought
for us since the Second World War.

331
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:30,205
And like those before him,
Blaine believed in right and wrong,

332
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:33,337
in knowing the difference
and then doing something about it.

333
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,970
He told me stories...

334
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,723
he heard as a kid about his grandfather.

335
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,936
A Tuskegee airman
killed in action in 1944.

336
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,190
He would like that we're here,

337
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,066
placing these photos together...

338
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,574
...at his hero's grave.

339
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:57,074
And he damn sure loved his country,

340
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,527
like Captain America.

341
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,495
And none of us know how we would react

342
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,709
if we were put in the same position
he was.

343
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,765
The fear, the noise.

344
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,594
But if I was Blaine,

345
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,384
I would've shot the motherfuckers.
I would've blown their fucking heads off.

346
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,594
That's just me.

347
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,643
I would've been the last man standing.

348
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,635
And I don't have any military background,
but I'm like a mother duck.

349
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,312
You get in the way of my ducklings...

350
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,160
Man, just sit down.

351
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,524
Just... Just sit down.

352
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,522
You should have seen him watching Coco.

353
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,145
Puddle of tears.

354
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,899
It's an emotional movie.

355
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,986
He's really heaving.

356
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,610
God, that's hard to watch. Okay.

357
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,664
I think we've seen enough.

358
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,161
From now on, you will be known as Seven.

359
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:45,829
I'm One.

360
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,499
So, there's seven of us.

361
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,172
No, six.

362
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,353
There's this trick that we all do
to get through our day.

363
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:10,694
We take a box and into that box,
we place all the horrors of the world,

364
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,402
all the wrongs humans do to one another.

365
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,860
And then we close the box
and pretend it doesn't exist.

366
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,618
Only some of us spend too much time
inside the box.

367
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,365
We've lost our ability to pretend.

368
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,831
We know there's too much
unfinished business

369
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,043
in this fucked-up world.

370
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:33,169
Our job as ghosts is to do the dirty work
the living can't or won't.

371
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,424
And we do it from here.

372
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,092
This is our haunted house.

373
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,138
It's a lot like the Batcave,
except it's nothing like the Batcave.

374
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,471
Seven, you're dead.

375
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,180
You're gonna be restricted to cities
that you've never visited before.

376
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,438
People that you've never met.

377
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,689
All, of course, except your fellow ghosts.

378
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:55,071
None of whom you'll know by name,
only number, for safety,

379
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,647
and so no one gets too close.

380
00:28:58,737 --> 00:28:59,737
Walk over here.

381
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,622
This is our target hit board.

382
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:07,294
These nine men have been placing
too much shit inside the box.

383
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,964
So, now, they answer to us.

384
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,880
Target number one: this prick.

385
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,214
First mission:

386
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:20,473
the dictator of Turgistan, Rovach Alimov.

387
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,009
When you're dead,
you get to stop all the bullshit.

388
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:26,012
No more DMV lines,
no more shopping Christmas...

389
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,387
Or backstabbing girlfriends.

390
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,104
They should make
an "Out of Office" reply for dead people.

391
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,865
"Sorry I'm away from the planet right now.

392
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,312
I'm fucking dead."

393
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,024
No more tax, no more criminal records,

394
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:40,317
no more getting arrested by the pigs
just for being naked or just usual stuff.

395
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,703
You know, being naked, getting drunk.
Casual stuff.

396
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,878
Know the best part about being dead?

397
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,118
- Mm.
- No more immigration lines.

398
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,752
Don't look at me like that.
I'm fucking American.

399
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,039
I'm illegal.

400
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,921
You guys sure are cynical.

401
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,249
How about high blood pressure?

402
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,894
Fuck you, high blood pressure.
I'll eat whatever the fuck I want.

403
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,250
Thank you very much.

404
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,468
You realize you're actually still alive,
right?

405
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,143
Fuck you, too, technology.

406
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,620
What they don't know
is I've been making magnets

407
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,694
since my seventh grade
science fair project,

408
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,953
which I completely dominated, by the way.

409
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,692
I figured out
how to take big stuff like this...

410
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,896
This is pure shit.

411
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:21,985
...into this.

412
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,370
I came up with neodymium, micro magnets.

413
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,408
Equal vibrating phones,
ten million cell phones...

414
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,012
...Priuses, Teslas, all use my ingenuity.

415
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:33,076
And someday,
this will make me very, very rich.

416
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:38,166
You guys, you got it all wrong, you know.

417
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,510
Best thing about being dead...

418
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,422
is the freedom.

419
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,720
I mean, we're all gonna die.

420
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,144
May as well do it
while we're alive, right?

421
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,807
When you're young, you lock yourselves
into all of these bad decisions.

422
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,852
You know, marriages and mortgages,
and all that kind of stuff.

423
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:56,937
But you die...

424
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,400
it's all erased.

425
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,526
Poof! Gone.

426
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,240
From that point forward,
all that matters is what you choose.

427
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,162
The point is that we should bring Seven
behind the curtain.

428
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,156
You wanna hand me those over there?

429
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:19,383
Here we go. All right,
a little demonstration, no technology.

430
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:24,550
This is how to stage a coup
in three not-so-easy steps.

431
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,432
All right, you got a country,
Turgistan, yeah?

432
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,560
These are the people, nice people,
going about, doing their thing.

433
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:35,642
Then you got the four generals,
cuatro cunts, very bad guys.

434
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,227
But there's one worse guy.

435
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,607
That's the piece-of-shit dictator.

436
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,613
Right there at the top.

437
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,981
Don't forget his brother.

438
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,687
Democracy-loving brother.

439
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,488
He's the key.

440
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:50,783
So, we're gonna hit the four generals.
They're gonna lead us to the brother.

441
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:54,117
You kill top generals,
you fuck a dictator's day.

442
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,243
The second thing we're gonna do
is free the brother.

443
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:59,459
The last thing that we're gonna do
is we're gonna say goodbye

444
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:03,842
to piece-of-shit dictator
and hello to democracy-loving brother.

445
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,129
It all goes down in four months.

446
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:10,466
El Día de los Muertos.
The Day of the Dead.

447
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,272
Oh, that's it?

448
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,444
Oh, well, that's pretty simple, you know?

449
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,188
It's cups.

450
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,935
So, we're all gonna die?

451
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,775
Not me.

452
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,105
She's not. We all are.

453
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,238
- Painfully.
- Yeah, y'all are funny.

454
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:35,695
So, what else can you tell me
about this guy Rovach in Turgistan?

455
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,312
On the Turgistan border,

456
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,086
hundreds of thousands
are fleeing Rovach's reign...

457
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,858
Military targets the aid work...

458
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,842
Rovach's military targets
these secret hospitals.

459
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,927
As the world sits on the sideline...

460
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,823
A million people have been displaced
since the conflict began.

461
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:14,946
We have over 80,000 in this camp alone,
nearly half of them children.

462
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,744
- Heartbreaking. God.
- Yeah.

463
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,958
I'd love to show you
the hospital we just built.

464
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,498
We're not gonna go to the hospital.

465
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,461
I'm a little behind
on my malaria pills, but...

466
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,092
Malaria's not an issue in this part.

467
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,288
I'll be the judge of that.

468
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,548
Here's what we're gonna do, though.
Okay, I'm gonna...

469
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,172
- What's your name again?
- Oliver.

470
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,388
Oliver. Oliver here is gonna take
a picture of us right there,

471
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:36,849
and then I am going to take some shots
of some kids, hopefully not too sick,

472
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,811
nothing too depressing, no amputees.

473
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,311
Then I'm gonna carry some...

474
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,154
...you know, water jugs around,

475
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:46,479
and then I'm gonna cut your foundation
a giant check.

476
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,186
- Okay, what's your name again?
- Mike.

477
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,356
Yeah, okay. Thank you, Mike.

478
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,032
Watch out there.

479
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,865
- Please, let me help you.
- It's balanced.

480
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,780
If I dropped one,

481
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,038
I'd just walk around in circles.

482
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,077
What's that rich guy doing here?

483
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,294
I don't know.
Photo op for social media?

484
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,374
Showing he cares?

485
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,711
I should've been a soccer player.
I could've gone pro.

486
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,273
Get out of here. We're good.

487
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,401
- They're gonna hit us!
- What's going on?

488
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,821
Come with us! We gotta get the masks!

489
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,633
- Get the masks!
- Gas! Gas!

490
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,710
- Get the masks!
- Gas!

491
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,163
- Go open the boxes.
- Pass them out.

492
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,227
Put that on. Put this on.

493
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,835
We're in the Louvre.
In the most beautiful place in the world.

494
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:41,925
Shut it off.

495
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,049
But, sir...

496
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,635
- Where did you find this?
- Social media, sir.

497
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:48,931
It's everywhere. News outlets
and foreign governments are greeting it

498
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,426
with universal condemnation.

499
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,996
He is a war criminal
that no one holds accountable.

500
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:57,020
His worst atrocities involve
banned chemical weapons.

501
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,441
Such a fuss.

502
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,897
It's all perfectly bloodless.

503
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,949
Who do you think shot it?

504
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,567
Impress me.

505
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:06,946
You shot it,

506
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,201
had it shot and leaked,

507
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:12,832
to communicate resolve, inspire fear.

508
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:20,836
Show my enemies what's in store for them
and for those they love.

509
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,590
It's only the beginning.

510
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,350
Thou wast provoked by thy foul mind,

511
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,444
which never dreamt on aught
but butcheries.

512
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,479
Say that I slew them not.

513
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,613
But dead they are,
and devilish slain by thee.

514
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,494
Why dost thou spit at me?

515
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,281
Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake.

516
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,947
Never came poison from so sweet a place.

517
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,996
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.

518
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,630
Thine eyes,
sweet lady, have infected mine.

519
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,549
Would they were
basilisks, to strike thee dead!

520
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:12,734
Martini.

521
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,564
Stirred. Not shaken, stirred.

522
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,357
What's your opinion?

523
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,991
I'll take a Negroni.

524
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,070
Just poured.

525
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,321
Sorry?

526
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,327
On the... On the play?

527
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:33,829
There's that old cliché,
"Does art actually imitate life?"

528
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,833
'Cause you got this tyrant
who's walking the stage...

529
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:37,746
Baasha.

530
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,673
And, uh, in the first act,

531
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,339
his cruelty goes completely unpunished.

532
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,552
But in the fifth...

533
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,474
In the fifth... justice.

534
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,635
Always justice.

535
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,022
You see a tyrant.

536
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:58,481
I see a man bringing order
to a disordered world.

537
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:02,646
Scouring its filth,
polishing it till it shines.

538
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,953
In art, our most fervent hopes come true.

539
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,658
Heroes always win.

540
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,739
It's bullshit.

541
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:13,869
In life... totally different.

542
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:19,753
Nah, I'm with Shakespeare.
Act Five's coming.

543
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,544
- To Shakespeare.
- Mm.

544
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:22,627
To Bill.

545
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,299
I think you both just spoiled the end.

546
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,340
No.

547
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:30,932
We didn't.

548
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,437
I didn't catch your name.

549
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,599
- Rovach.
- No, I was talking to her.

550
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,862
Do you mind? I can feel the tip.

551
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,196
Yeah.

552
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,197
He's no longer inside me. We're safe.

553
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,493
What is your name?

554
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,285
Arianna.

555
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:00,331
Arianna.
Big guy's still staring at me, isn't he?

556
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,961
- Yeah.
- He's gonna kick my ass later.

557
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,044
- Good.
- Yeah.

558
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,155
We must be doing something wrong.

559
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,122
Why?

560
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:39,122
'Cause the chocolates have lasted
the whole night right there.

561
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,325
- Like they're glued there.
- That's crazy.

562
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,790
I'm getting old.

563
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,955
Do you believe what that man said?

564
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,433
Evil goes unpunished.

565
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,716
I believe he believes it.

566
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,060
And what about you?

567
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,142
I just feel like the whole world's,
like, on an...

568
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,806
endless, evil...

569
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,935
shitty loop.

570
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,614
Hmm.

571
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,361
But he'll get his.

572
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,704
You know, this was fun.

573
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,371
Are you ghosting me?

574
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,324
Do I look like a ghost to you?

575
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,586
No. It's like the things you say,
it sounds like you want to be.

576
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,091
- The things I say.
- Mm-hmm.

577
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,427
But what makes you think
that I want to see you again?

578
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,097
You weren't that memorable.

579
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,058
Ow!

580
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,480
Besides, I'm moving to New York.

581
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,732
Mmm.

582
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,225
That's where I live.

583
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,356
Sucker.

584
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,030
So, now you're stalking me?

585
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,405
Maybe a little bit.

586
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:10,339
And now you're all caught up.

587
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:18,143
Anything happen in school today?

588
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,808
Angela Valentine said
she was going to get sick in class.

589
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,019
What happened?

590
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,099
She did.

591
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:26,482
- Hey, what do you know about One?
- He loves Wally the dog.

592
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:29,652
He's obsessed with this Beaver show.
I think he's an orphan.

593
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,192
We got a little bet on
if you wanna put some money in.

594
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,290
It's an interesting crew
you got here, bro.

595
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,700
How many missions you guys run?

596
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:36,859
- Counting Florence?
- Yeah.

597
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,025
- One.
- One what?

598
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,219
Actually, no, there was, um,
this, like, mini-mission,

599
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,163
so maybe one and a quarter.
It was in Sicily.

600
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,405
But Florence, absolute shitshow.

601
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:48,327
I mean, if I wasn't there,
probably more than one of us dead.

602
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,537
- That's all I'm saying.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

603
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,340
I don't fuck around.

604
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:55,061
You realize I just buried myself
in front of my family and friends?

605
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,550
Yeah, One told me about that.

606
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,304
Big military funeral.

607
00:43:58,385 --> 00:43:59,595
Guns popping, flags.

608
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,616
It's pretty cool. At my funeral,
there was five people there,

609
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,220
and two of them left before the end.

610
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,348
It is tough watching
your mum cry at your grave.

611
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,265
Yeah.

612
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,813
This mission, I got a good feeling.

613
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,106
I got a really good feeling
about this mission.

614
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,362
How come you can't find this guy?

615
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:18,664
I don't know. One can usually find anyone,
but he just can't seem to find him.

616
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,819
He said Americans caught him
a few years back.

617
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,078
Americans?

618
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:23,576
I don't know.

619
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,550
Prep your team, target...

620
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,141
Camille, I get you hate this,

621
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,125
but sometimes you gotta put bad guys
on thrones.

622
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,289
Just do your job.

623
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,783
No one touch. He's mine.

624
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,508
I was assured by your state department...

625
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:22,722
- I'm from a different department.
- God, CIA.

626
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,473
I've come to deliver you to your brother.

627
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:28,273
You don't know my brother.
Rovach is a monster.

628
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:33,020
He'll violate every single principle
your nation holds dear.

629
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,975
I begged the director
not to do this, Murat, begged.

630
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,753
The Americans caught him years back
and gave him to his brother.

631
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,699
That bald-looking fella.
You like him though, One, yeah?

632
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,070
He's definitely an arsehole,
but a likable arseshole, no?

633
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,410
- No.
- Well, he likes you.

634
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:49,498
Here's the fun part.

635
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,620
How many billionaires
do you actually know?

636
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,497
You've heard of Elon Musk,
Bill Gates, that's the... Fuck it.

637
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,745
Okay. Of course
you haven't heard of me before.

638
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,467
That's how I like it. I'm a good inventor.

639
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:02,798
Created a lot of tech, tracking
and hiding digital trails of people.

640
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,845
Some I even sold to the CIA,

641
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,678
where I met some interesting people,
did some adventurous shit.

642
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,813
But slowly, I cleaned house,
and I had other ideas.

643
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,895
Used my money to help people
in bad situations.

644
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,610
But I realized,
my billions, that's not enough.

645
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,691
Governments don't really help
people in need.

646
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:23,447
So, I said, "Fuck the government.
I'm gonna do this myself."

647
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,450
So, here we are. A little eyeball led us
to these fuckhead generals,

648
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:27,583
and it's game on.

649
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,695
Okay, General,
you're flying to Vegas.

650
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:33,168
I have a very important mission for you.

651
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:35,918
You are going to meet Viktor,
the arms dealer.

652
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:37,752
Get drunk.

653
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,131
We're going to Vegas, baby!

654
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,050
Viktor, Vegas, viceroy.

655
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,886
General Garioff, lots of consonants,
so we'll make this easy.

656
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,732
The little fat one, he's the handler
of Rovach's baby brother.

657
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:58,404
Las Vegas has more facial recognition
software than any place on Earth.

658
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,782
Oh, I know what I'm gonna be.

659
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,948
Choose your disguises wisely.

660
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,278
I'm a grown man. I can handle my shit.

661
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,764
That's not how the expression goes.

662
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:09,585
Don't handle your shit, flush it down
the toilet like a grown-ass man.

663
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:12,248
Be subtle. Blend in. Disappear.

664
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,766
Okay, now it's safe.

665
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:43,069
You mean the red one or the blue one?

666
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,871
- Probably a Ferrari.
- You don't see gas of this quality.

667
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:50,331
It's US Army, experimental sarin gas
for testing antidotes.

668
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,619
Whatever's left over,
they bury in the desert.

669
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,123
Now, I can procure it,

670
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,580
but you take delivery here.

671
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,629
And no middlemen.

672
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,670
Kill them all?

673
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:03,763
Mm-hmm.

674
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,298
Love it.

675
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:16,477
- A gift from Viktor.
- I love Viktor.

676
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:37,998
Oh!

677
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:39,916
Coming!

678
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,054
Welcome to party!

679
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,943
It's too late.

680
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,687
The deal is done.

681
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,397
Two tons of sarin gas.

682
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,954
- Where are you keeping Rovach's brother?
- What?

683
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:53,119
You got three seconds. Be specific.

684
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,948
No, don't think, don't think. Talk!

685
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,409
Three, two...

686
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:01,674
Ni Hai Tower, uh, in Hong Kong, penthouse.

687
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,382
...one.

688
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,005
It could be worse.

689
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,759
You know, he could've finished.

690
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:15,933
Good work. I said undercover,
not coked-up Borg and McEnroe.

691
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,465
I hate this town. I really do.

692
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:22,307
No, it's Navratilova.
She's a woman tennis player.

693
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,774
Your costume's stupid, too.
Motorcycle dick.

694
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,981
I'm so, so sorry, ladies.

695
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,776
But what happens in Vegas...

696
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,489
You know the rest, yeah?

697
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:42,329
We can't.

698
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,254
Ow! Watch the gun.

699
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:48,335
Oh, my gosh.

700
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,590
- We can't do this.
- What?

701
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:52,843
No kissing.

702
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:54,892
I'm cool with that.

703
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,676
Stop kissing!

704
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,557
What? I'm not kissing.

705
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,781
- Come here.
- Nose off.

706
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,734
Way better.

707
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,632
Where are you running to?

708
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,633
One promised my soul back.

709
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:34,304
I just gotta talk to somebody.

710
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,722
You're scared.

711
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,638
You're such a pussy.

712
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,553
Ever stage a coup d'état?

713
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,387
No. No, I don't even know what it means.

714
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:47,273
Oh, wow. A coup. A coup d’état.
It's French, Napoleon.

715
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,814
French history stuff.

716
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:50,481
Okay.

717
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:52,521
You can't tear a place down

718
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,317
until you have someone
to build it back up.

719
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:57,162
That someone is Rovach's brother, Murat.

720
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,779
Imprisoned in Hong Kong.

721
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:01,365
You see, the army's fucked
now we killed the generals.

722
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,747
They will look for a new leader.

723
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,209
And we're gonna give them one.

724
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:09,253
"Coup." I don't even know what it means.
Stupid word.

725
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,805
Oh, my favorite.

726
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:32,106
I know, Mama. How you doing?

727
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,896
Well, you see, Ma...

728
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:41,775
there's this country, Uzbekis...
No, Turg...

729
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,657
Turkis... Turkikas...

730
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,754
Fuck! Turkikasazhan?

731
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,540
Ma, all I know is that it's got a "stan"
at the end,

732
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:52,344
- and it's in Asia.
- Oh, by Kansas!

733
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,878
Ish. Yes, Mama, by Kansas.

734
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:59,014
Anyway, the man who ran it died,
and, uh...

735
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,721
he... he left behind two sons.

736
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:04,925
One good and one bad.

737
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,893
And the bad one came out on top.

738
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:10,016
So, what the fuck are you looking at,
Nurse Ratched?

739
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,395
Huh?

740
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,648
Go hang with the fucking nuns
or something.

741
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:15,572
Yeah, walk.

742
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,650
Walk.

743
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:19,568
I will fucking knock you out
in front of my mother.

744
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:23,782
Sorry, Mama.

745
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:27,948
Anyway, the two sons fought,
and the bad one came out on top,

746
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,498
so he locked the good one up, and...

747
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,252
I never liked Diego.

748
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:36,251
Yeah, me either, Mama.
Working for him didn't agree with me.

749
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,627
But I work for someone else now, Ma.
We're doing good things.

750
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:43,929
Huh? We're fixing
what's going on in Kansas.

751
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,274
Good things can erase the bad ones,
right, Mama?

752
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,939
I love you, Andres.

753
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,651
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

754
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,651
No, Ma, Andres is in Bogota.
It's me, Javi.

755
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,445
- Javi.
- Javi?

756
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:03,908
I won't speak to Javi anymore
because he is a murderer.

757
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:07,541
Ma, it was only bad people, Mama.

758
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,385
Please,
you don't have to do this.

759
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,592
No, I do. My job.

760
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:29,519
Daddy?

761
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,179
I can't sleep.

762
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:43,779
Daddy?

763
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,446
He's not here.

764
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,241
Where's your mommy?

765
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,748
I don't have a mommy.

766
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,220
Javi loves you, Mama. Huh?

767
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:10,679
You and your Bruce Wayne shit!

768
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:11,885
Boo.

769
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,475
One rule.

770
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:15,766
One rule.

771
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,191
You don't know what it's like
to have someone.

772
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,145
She doesn't even remember my name.

773
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,945
So, she'll never know you stopped coming.

774
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:27,319
See, you're lucky that I don't paint
the inside of this car

775
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:28,777
with chunks of your fucking skull.

776
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,447
Jesus, who raised you, the mob?

777
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:32,695
That's none of your fucking business,
Three.

778
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:35,995
We sacrificed everything
to be a part of this.

779
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:38,252
Honor it, respect it. It's all we got.

780
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:48,643
I don't usually stand on ceremony,
but today,

781
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:51,769
what just befell your superiors
in America

782
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:55,942
undid over 60 years of loyal service
to my family.

783
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:58,814
Those fine men won't be replaced easily.

784
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:04,107
Colonel Zaga, Niazo, Abdulim, Daheem.

785
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,105
You're next in line, gentlemen.

786
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:13,237
Your combined experience is nearly that
of your predecessors,

787
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:16,285
but if my generals' shoes
are to be filled,

788
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,711
I need men like you.

789
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,000
Like you,

790
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,336
but not you.

791
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,237
I don't know
who killed my generals,

792
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:49,778
but I'd be a fool to trust the men
who most stood to benefit.

793
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:53,988
So, next men up, congratulations!

794
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:06,169
All right, we're gonna tiptoe
through these waypoints here, under radar.

795
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,836
There's our backdoor to Hong Kong.

796
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:09,466
Hey, One!

797
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,683
You ever plan on calling me Six?

798
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,180
- No.
- Okay.

799
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:17,535
- Hey, look, I know we don't get to ask...
- Then don't.

800
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,349
But, uh, who is One?

801
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,559
- Who is he?
- A rich guy who snapped.

802
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:22,476
That's all I got.

803
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,694
- Yeah, but how did you meet him?
- We didn't.

804
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:27,494
He met us. In really weird ways.

805
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:28,989
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. Very weird,

806
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:31,780
like, perfect timing kind of weird.

807
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,254
Cheap. Fake.

808
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:46,754
Fuck! We ain't leaving
till we find the Kalahari.

809
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:01,064
Let's go.

810
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,209
Oh, shit.

811
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:35,636
Shit!

812
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,023
Whoa, whoa!

813
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,979
Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

814
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:50,651
Hang on!

815
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:14,299
I'm rich.

816
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,858
What do you want?
What do you fucking want?

817
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,945
Hey! Hey! Calm down.

818
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:38,914
What are you? Are you a fucking pig?

819
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,290
Are you afraid?

820
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,084
Never.

821
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:51,922
There's power in that.

822
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,125
More power finding a cause.

823
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:00,966
Something so important
that you're afraid to lose it,

824
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:03,274
afraid that you're gonna die
some other way.

825
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:04,519
For nothing...

826
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,496
- instead of what you're fighting for.
- You're making a mistake to do this.

827
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,690
I'm a thief.

828
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,981
I've been robbing my whole f...
I can make you money.

829
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:12,725
- Are you afraid?
- I've got skills.

830
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,993
- I can be useful. I can help you.
- You're gonna die now.

831
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,923
- I can fucking help you!
- Gonna fucking die now.

832
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:20,367
- If you're gonna do it, fucking do it.
- You die now!

833
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,450
Fucking do it!

834
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,843
- Oh, my God!
- You sick fuck! Who fucking does that?

835
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:34,759
- You should have seen your face.
- You sick fuck!

836
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:36,169
It's not fucking funny!

837
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:37,717
It's really funny.

838
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,298
Ooh, I never thought I'd meet a family
more screwed up than mine.

839
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:44,307
Hey, no. Don't say that.
He hates the word "family." I don't know.

840
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:45,520
I think he never had one.

841
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,640
And if you're ever left behind
in a mission...

842
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,654
he's not coming back for you.

843
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:50,729
What?

844
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:52,942
We Deltas don't operate like that.

845
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,989
Things are gonna have to change.
I promise you that.

846
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:59,534
FMS, Hong Kong. Engine start.

847
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:03,282
Look, I know we're not supposed to ask,
but I'm a nosy dude.

848
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:04,828
So, here goes.

849
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,661
You could have fought a million battles.

850
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,666
Why now... and why Turgistan?

851
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:13,288
Everybody talks about helping.
It's nice to actually do something.

852
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,568
It is quite the view, little brother.

853
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:40,859
Personally, I'd prefer more gold,
you know.

854
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:43,952
Black.

855
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:47,163
- I'm alone.
- Closing on you, it's, like, dark.

856
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,078
You know Sultan Ahmed I?

857
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:52,632
That shit.

858
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:57,209
In 1603, Sultan Ahmed I
gave a gift to his younger siblings.

859
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:59,296
Magnificent wing in Topkapi Palace.

860
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,552
The gilded cage.

861
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:03,392
Yeah, I've learned my history, too.

862
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:07,312
Would you prefer the sultans before Ahmed?

863
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:11,229
Who strangled the younger brother
with the same silk sheets?

864
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:18,071
You have your own library, screening room.

865
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:20,446
Yeah, it's a fun prison.

866
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:23,448
And this, what is... what is this?

867
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:24,735
Art.

868
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:25,874
Ugly art.

869
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,413
And the occasional visit
from a loving brother.

870
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:32,575
Quite generous after you tried to take
what was rightfully mine.

871
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,915
The throne is not yours or mine.

872
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:37,504
- It belongs to the people.
- The people?

873
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,007
Yes, brother, the people.

874
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:40,798
Like they're some sacred body.

875
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:46,221
Instead of a violent, ignorant,
illiterate mob who just begs for the whip.

876
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,564
He's got his anger issues.

877
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,523
What are you doing here?

878
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:56,060
These shameful chemical attacks of yours,

879
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:58,567
you're making me more popular
than yourself.

880
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:01,355
The only way you'll ever leave this place

881
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:04,494
is if Daqeeq here throws you
through that window.

882
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:06,032
I wish.

883
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:16,127
My generals, the Four Horsemen,
were just executed.

884
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,125
Do you know anything about that?

885
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:21,761
Do you?

886
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:27,221
These attacks on my generals

887
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,223
will only increase the frequency
of my chemical strikes.

888
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:35,057
It may take years,
but they will carve you up

889
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:38,364
for all the beautiful things
you have done for these people.

890
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:41,029
Who? The US? They made me.

891
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,991
Russia? They armed me.

892
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:48,834
Daqeeq, seriously?

893
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,538
Did you buy that shirt by yourself?

894
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:52,410
You're embarrassing me.

895
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,705
Sorry. I have bad taste.

896
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:59,091
Daqeeq is under strict order:

897
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:02,958
If any harm should befall me,
the same exact harm will befall you.

898
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,837
Specifically and immediately.

899
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,300
I'm going back to Turgistan.

900
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,599
To my safe travels.

901
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:14,977
Hey, team, we're below radar.

902
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:17,689
So, buckle up
'cause it's about to get bumpy.

903
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:19,688
Oh, fuck me.

904
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:23,566
You know, I usually look at the stewardess
to see if I should be scared.

905
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:25,737
Flight attendant.

906
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:27,988
You can look at me.

907
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,241
Oh, darling, you could be on fire,

908
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:33,925
and you would have the same creepy,
blank expression on your face.

909
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:34,953
No offense.

910
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:37,575
You know, guys, what sucks?

911
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:41,589
If we were to crash,
no one would ever know or care.

912
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:43,419
We would have no impact on anything.

913
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:44,804
Like we never existed.

914
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,651
I can hear you,
and if you're gonna shit your pants,

915
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:49,175
there's a bathroom in the back.

916
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:55,268
The world is wrapped in red tape,

917
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:59,305
and I couldn't cut through it
even with a billion-dollar sword.

918
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,233
So, we left behind everything,

919
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,527
everyone,

920
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:05,779
to become...

921
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:07,527
no one.

922
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:13,992
So, how long's this been going on?

923
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,249
What?

924
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:19,079
I've been wondering the same thing.
Florence?

925
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,171
Nah, Vegas.

926
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,130
- Vegas.
- Definitely Vegas.

927
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,416
So, you guys know about us?

928
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,884
- Well, we do now, dumbass.
- Nice.

929
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:31,586
Well, I guess it's not against the rules,
right?

930
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:35,257
Depends.
So, are you guys fucking or making love?

931
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:36,518
What's the difference?

932
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:38,266
We're fucking.

933
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:40,648
Oh, good.

934
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:43,228
Hey. Who's this honey badger?

935
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,574
- I'm... I'm Raymond.
- Hi, Raymond.

936
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:46,900
You new to the team?

937
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:48,494
Just... Just hanging out.

938
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:50,153
It's Britney, bitch.

939
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:53,236
So, we should probably go discuss
our sensitive geopolitical issues

940
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:56,044
when we're, you know, Raymond-free.
Great security, though.

941
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,288
Really great.

942
01:05:57,745 --> 01:05:58,825
Especially you.

943
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:02,955
Hong Kong, penthouse extraction.

944
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:06,751
We're gonna break out Rovach's
baby brother from his 90th-floor prison.

945
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:10,471
It's a simple snatch-and-grab.
Minus the word simple because it's not.

946
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:12,179
- And minus the word snatch...
- Snatch?

947
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:13,639
- Snatch.
- Snatch.

948
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:15,322
- Snatch what?
- Minus the word "snatch-and-grab."

949
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:16,949
- They mean the same thing.
- Snatch?

950
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,393
Snatch. Stop saying that.

951
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:20,937
This mine.

952
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:23,314
Yeah, nothing's simple.

953
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:25,856
The next building over,
we use the sky cranes.

954
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,690
One as a sniper's nest for yours truly,

955
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:29,375
one as a crossover,
building to building.

956
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:32,067
Crane lose control. Very dangerous.

957
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,575
- Stay off the roof.
- What do you mean?

958
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,657
- Because I will fuck you up.
- You not fuck me up.

959
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:40,097
- What?
- Don't talk to me like this!

960
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:42,081
- Smash you like a bitch.
- No, no, no, no.

961
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:43,504
No? Bye.

962
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:54,337
We have 15 minutes
before HK police arrive.

963
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:08,517
- You afraid?
- Nope.

964
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:10,987
- Good luck.
- Saying good luck is bad luck.

965
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:13,398
- I take it back.
- Taking it back is even worse luck.

966
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:15,277
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Yeah.

967
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:17,115
Good luck.

968
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:18,993
Do you want me to die?

969
01:07:19,493 --> 01:07:20,493
Wanker.

970
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:24,706
It's time.

971
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:35,295
Ferrari's landed.

972
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:41,324
It's a good ride, One.

973
01:07:41,348 --> 01:07:43,228
A little scary up here, but...

974
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:46,229
Nah, this is fun.
Don't be a pussy, Seven.

975
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:48,729
Yeah, I got the gun, smartass.

976
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:49,824
Remember that.

977
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:54,204
Slow it down, One. Slow it down.

978
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:59,155
Overwatch is set.

979
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:04,746
I got the target in his bed,
scratching his balls,

980
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:06,290
reading some Chinese book.

981
01:08:06,373 --> 01:08:07,463
Hit it, guys.

982
01:08:17,384 --> 01:08:18,724
Eagle's landed.

983
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:20,433
I love that movie line.

984
01:08:34,693 --> 01:08:35,863
Hello, boys.

985
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:43,699
You know, laughter is life.

986
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:46,871
Just kidding.
I stole that from my old dentist's office.

987
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,326
Along with a shit ton of nitrous.

988
01:08:51,752 --> 01:08:52,752
Hey!

989
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,416
Badges? We don't need no stinking badges.

990
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,184
One, laughing gas is working.

991
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,930
Oh, shit.

992
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:09,936
We got a 911.

993
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:12,306
- Cops were called.
- Cops?

994
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:13,648
We got 13 minutes.

995
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:19,534
Zip line secure.

996
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:22,740
Ready, ready.

997
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:24,534
One.

998
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:27,583
There's movement, man.

999
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:28,753
Where?

1000
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:31,001
Four bogeys. Rooftop.

1001
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:42,850
What, am I funny to you?

1002
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:43,798
Huh?

1003
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:44,928
I'm funny?

1004
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,724
How am I funny to you?

1005
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:48,347
Do I amuse you?

1006
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:52,516
I'm gonna need your finger. Come here.

1007
01:09:59,236 --> 01:10:00,986
Two and Three, in the elevator.

1008
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:04,025
All right. You got targets.

1009
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:05,276
On your left, eye level.

1010
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:20,627
Underwater. Thirty seconds.

1011
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,801
He's in some shit, man.

1012
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:32,271
Freeze, Four.

1013
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:33,851
He's above you.

1014
01:10:35,272 --> 01:10:36,482
Sixty seconds.

1015
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:39,315
One, he's gonna drown. I got four guys
up top. Want me to drop 'em?

1016
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:40,691
No, mission will be compromised.

1017
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,857
Let me drop 'em, One. This is what I do.

1018
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:48,241
He's been under 120.

1019
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,079
He's gonna drown.

1020
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:52,997
Four, move right.

1021
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:56,667
Incoming round.

1022
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:01,471
You're welcome.

1023
01:11:01,548 --> 01:11:04,088
And y'all can refer to me as Mr. Seven
from now on.

1024
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,010
Hot mask.

1025
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,807
In a Darth Vader daughter kind of way.

1026
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:13,475
Maybe later we can... coochie-coochie?

1027
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,400
Stop it.

1028
01:11:14,478 --> 01:11:15,848
Woochie-woochie-coochie.

1029
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,308
A little over-the-top, guys.

1030
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:18,608
Oh, Check this out.

1031
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,071
I went to the dentist.

1032
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:21,739
Oh, my God.

1033
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:24,199
- You lost one of the seals!
- Huh?

1034
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,450
You're on laughing gas,
you dumb motherfucker.

1035
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:27,676
Give me your gun.

1036
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,262
- I'm not giving you my gun.
- You're a danger to yourself.

1037
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,406
I am the danger.

1038
01:11:32,496 --> 01:11:33,556
No more movie lines.

1039
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,580
Okay? Not just tonight... but ever.

1040
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:37,706
It's a TV line, not a movie line.

1041
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:39,003
Just stay behind me.

1042
01:11:39,086 --> 01:11:40,836
Yes, Miss Vader.

1043
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:46,152
- You almost done there?
- Okay, we've got a problem.

1044
01:11:46,176 --> 01:11:49,136
Three got hit with nitrous,
and he's stupider than usual.

1045
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:51,851
This is the funniest shit ever!

1046
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:57,055
How you doing over there?

1047
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,186
You having fun yet?

1048
01:11:58,272 --> 01:12:00,752
Anyone ever asked you dumb questions
when you're 90 stories up?

1049
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:02,483
No need to climb angry.

1050
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:05,068
Mate, you're really ruining my flow
right now, you know that?

1051
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:06,840
Get those
high-intensity speakers placed.

1052
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:08,874
I got the targets all grouped
in the kitchen.

1053
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:12,159
Hey, have you ever... you ever been
to an American movie theater?

1054
01:12:12,244 --> 01:12:14,254
Between 1983 and 2015?

1055
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,210
No, I just pirate them on my phone.

1056
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:18,575
That's an asshole move. All right.

1057
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:20,707
Get ready to pull that trigger.

1058
01:12:20,794 --> 01:12:22,054
Till my finger hurts.

1059
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,600
No party here! No party!

1060
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:47,987
Hit it.

1061
01:12:48,072 --> 01:12:49,072
Now.

1062
01:12:55,662 --> 01:12:57,252
I see dead people.

1063
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:09,944
Help me.

1064
01:13:09,968 --> 01:13:10,968
Three!

1065
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:12,763
Get off.

1066
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:15,178
What are you doing?

1067
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:18,935
Move, move, move.
Move, move, move, move, move.

1068
01:13:25,275 --> 01:13:27,525
I got 'em up top.

1069
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:31,948
Move.

1070
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:37,575
Who are you? Stay away. Stay away!

1071
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:40,250
- Let's go.
- One, Four's got the target.

1072
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:41,960
Always starts out well.

1073
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:44,162
- Stay low.
- You're American military?

1074
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:47,712
Two, Three, you're clear to move up top.

1075
01:13:48,465 --> 01:13:49,965
Four, move.

1076
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,430
Got the target. Moving out.

1077
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:53,140
Let's go.

1078
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,850
Oh, wow. Look at this.

1079
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:57,020
- Stay behind me, idiot.
- Oh, yeah.

1080
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:02,830
- Don't move!
- I got him.

1081
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,273
Come on.

1082
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:07,066
Move, move, move, move, move.

1083
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:13,317
Get back here!

1084
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:14,447
One sec.

1085
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:16,987
- Oh, pearl handle.
- Oh, shit.

1086
01:14:17,077 --> 01:14:18,447
That's a cool piece.

1087
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:20,657
This is like bringing a child
to a gunfight.

1088
01:14:22,749 --> 01:14:23,749
Whoa.

1089
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:28,760
There you go. Come on, come on, come on.
Say peek-a-boo, you punk.

1090
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:30,798
No, no! Stop!

1091
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:34,257
Ouch!

1092
01:14:34,344 --> 01:14:35,974
Who the fuck was that?

1093
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:37,644
Somebody speak to me.

1094
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:41,273
- Please tell me I did not just kill Three.
- What? These are good masks.

1095
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:43,691
The hell you picking up
a bad guy's gun for, man?

1096
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:45,707
- You shot me, bro!
- This is going great.

1097
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,584
- You shot me!
- Because you're an idiot.

1098
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:50,778
- You don't look through a bullet hole.
- I'm so mad at everyone right now.

1099
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:52,491
What's new? I like you mad.

1100
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:54,741
Wrong intel. Too many men.

1101
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,913
Oh, no. I'm pissed now.

1102
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:59,582
I just got shot by my own man.
More guys coming.

1103
01:15:08,795 --> 01:15:10,523
What's going on?
You guys have one minute left.

1104
01:15:10,547 --> 01:15:12,967
We're only supposed to have
seven guys working.

1105
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:14,550
Where are they coming from?

1106
01:15:14,968 --> 01:15:15,968
Go.

1107
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:17,641
We got five more targets.

1108
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:28,469
Get up here now, all you've got.

1109
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:36,158
Watch out for the snipers.

1110
01:15:37,282 --> 01:15:39,492
Two at the bar, three in the corner.

1111
01:15:39,576 --> 01:15:42,576
Okay, we do like that movie
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, okay?

1112
01:15:43,413 --> 01:15:45,213
They died at the end of that movie.

1113
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:48,128
- They do?
- Yeah.

1114
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:03,273
Hey, Chan, what's up?

1115
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:12,359
Two, Three, hold at the stair.

1116
01:16:27,207 --> 01:16:28,997
Fifteen minutes.

1117
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:32,667
Half of China's in the lobby.

1118
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:34,384
That's... That's high.

1119
01:16:34,464 --> 01:16:37,224
We're out of time.
What the hell are you guys doing up there?

1120
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:38,841
Come on.

1121
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:42,805
We're stuck at the stairwell.

1122
01:16:43,473 --> 01:16:44,853
Can we go down?

1123
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:47,603
Negative. This place is full of police.
Do not come down.

1124
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:52,648
They're surrounding us.

1125
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:54,533
Only one way out. That's up.

1126
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:57,363
Two coming up.

1127
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:01,278
Guys, I got a bad idea.

1128
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:04,446
What do you mean you have a bad idea?
No, you're supposed to have good ideas.

1129
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:10,210
Like a... really, really bad idea.

1130
01:17:12,836 --> 01:17:15,166
One, remember when I said
some shit was gonna go bad?

1131
01:17:15,255 --> 01:17:17,215
Shoot people! You're a sniper, goddamn it!

1132
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:20,049
It's fucked up right now,
so watch me work. I'm improvising.

1133
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:22,255
Y'all might wanna grab a hold
of some shit.

1134
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:25,137
- What do you mean?
- The pool!

1135
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:26,683
Oh, no, no, no! Back, back!

1136
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,517
Grab something!

1137
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:36,191
Jump!

1138
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:05,428
Hang on!

1139
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,915
You drowned everybody!

1140
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:38,166
Drowned the whole fucking team!

1141
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:39,774
- Dumbest idea ever.
- Fucking crazy.

1142
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:41,526
- Almost killed us.
- I don't like Seven.

1143
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:44,153
- We need a long talk after this.
- We'll chat later.

1144
01:18:44,177 --> 01:18:46,557
Hey. Whoa, whoa. Okay.

1145
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:48,055
Whoa.

1146
01:18:57,649 --> 01:19:00,049
You wanna tell everyone
where you learned that shit?

1147
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:07,329
- Go.
- Is a helicopter coming to rescue us?

1148
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:08,729
- Pretty soon.
- 'Cause...

1149
01:19:08,785 --> 01:19:11,325
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Come on, no. What? Wait.

1150
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:14,623
Oh, my God. I'm afraid of heights.
I will have a heart attack.

1151
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:16,838
- Yeah? Don't cover your face!
- Ah!

1152
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:18,628
- Ow!
- Why?

1153
01:19:20,213 --> 01:19:21,691
- I'm knocking him out.
- Stop.

1154
01:19:21,715 --> 01:19:23,465
- You're to save...
- Come on!

1155
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:25,050
It's gonna be over soon!

1156
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:26,675
- Ow!
- Hey, hey, hey!

1157
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,182
- Go down!
- Stop!

1158
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:30,143
- Goddamn it!
- What bullshit is this?

1159
01:19:30,223 --> 01:19:31,863
I thought you guys are here to rescue me.

1160
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:33,562
- He's the good guy.
- Yes!

1161
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:35,983
What's wrong with you, you fucking goon?

1162
01:19:36,062 --> 01:19:38,666
- I was trying to knock him out.
- No. He's the point of the mission.

1163
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:40,050
- Use your head.
- He wasn't going.

1164
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:40,938
No, get out! Go!

1165
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:44,816
Oh, my God!

1166
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:46,275
- Go.
- Whatever. I'm leaving.

1167
01:19:46,364 --> 01:19:47,534
Adiós, asshole.

1168
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:02,962
No. No!

1169
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:05,678
- No! No, no. Stay away.
- Come here!

1170
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:10,469
Get off me.

1171
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:13,635
- You fucking...
- Hey!

1172
01:20:15,435 --> 01:20:16,265
Come on.

1173
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:17,523
Oh, now what?

1174
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:19,902
- Do you have rabies?
- No.

1175
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:21,111
You have rabies?

1176
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:22,231
- What?
- What?

1177
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:24,947
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- He was escaping.

1178
01:20:25,028 --> 01:20:27,448
And why do you think
he might wanna get away from you?

1179
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:29,331
You should thank me.
I just saved the mission.

1180
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:31,026
What? Get off of him.

1181
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:33,055
- Get off of him.
- Get off me.

1182
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:35,289
How many times
do I have to save this mission? Fuck.

1183
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:38,502
- Probably have some ice in the car.
- Fucking sick prick. I'm so sorry.

1184
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:40,223
- Your buddy is an asshole.
- Hey.

1185
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:41,552
Come on. It gets better.

1186
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:42,628
Don't help.

1187
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:45,511
Don't help. Just stay right there,
James Bond. Thank you.

1188
01:20:47,008 --> 01:20:48,048
Oh, shit.

1189
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:52,137
Three bullets.

1190
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,692
Come on, Four. We're moving.

1191
01:20:58,562 --> 01:20:59,562
Just go.

1192
01:21:00,605 --> 01:21:01,605
I can't get across.

1193
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:03,977
They cut the zip line.

1194
01:21:04,734 --> 01:21:05,784
I'm sorry.

1195
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:08,355
It's just bad luck.

1196
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:15,366
Yeah.

1197
01:21:15,453 --> 01:21:16,583
Bad luck.

1198
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:30,548
Come on, come on.

1199
01:21:32,095 --> 01:21:33,135
That's a lot of cops.

1200
01:21:36,016 --> 01:21:37,556
Come on. Get up!

1201
01:21:38,643 --> 01:21:40,233
Whoa! I'm coming, I'm coming.

1202
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:47,111
What made your president change his mind?

1203
01:21:48,194 --> 01:21:51,874
This wasn't him. The guy doesn't know
how to spell Turgistan.

1204
01:21:52,657 --> 01:21:54,777
This better not be
what I'm thinking it is.

1205
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,247
- What's that?
- A coup.

1206
01:21:57,829 --> 01:21:59,749
Exchanging my brother with me.

1207
01:22:27,984 --> 01:22:30,154
- What is that?
- Three blew the budget on the Ferrari.

1208
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:33,818
- Sorry. My bad. My bad.
- Stupid.

1209
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:36,367
It's adorable.
We are not having a good night.

1210
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:56,348
I can't steer like Six, so let's avoid
any violent bullshit, all right?

1211
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:10,067
Oh!

1212
01:23:13,446 --> 01:23:14,606
Oh, shit!

1213
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:15,948
Was that a bad guy?

1214
01:23:32,048 --> 01:23:34,588
Shit.

1215
01:23:34,926 --> 01:23:35,756
Kill him?

1216
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:37,604
No.

1217
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,281
- Want me to kill him?
- No.

1218
01:23:39,305 --> 01:23:40,515
Hey!

1219
01:23:40,598 --> 01:23:42,978
- Cops. I've been kidnapped!
- I'm gonna kill him.

1220
01:23:43,059 --> 01:23:45,269
- And I'm gonna let you.
- They are kidnapping me!

1221
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:47,593
Hey, cops, where are you going?

1222
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:53,355
Whoa. Shit.

1223
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:15,548
Shit.

1224
01:24:16,926 --> 01:24:17,926
Fuck.

1225
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:29,897
Whoa!

1226
01:24:58,885 --> 01:25:00,345
Fuck.

1227
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:01,468
I made it across.

1228
01:25:01,971 --> 01:25:03,181
Southwest side.

1229
01:25:04,557 --> 01:25:05,977
Where are you guys?

1230
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:07,059
No!

1231
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:13,266
- Stop the car.
- No, don't stop the car.

1232
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:14,528
- We're leaving him.
- What?

1233
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:15,489
- No.
- He's on his own.

1234
01:25:15,568 --> 01:25:17,448
- Stop the car.
- Do not stop the car.

1235
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:19,659
- Stop the fucking car!
- Hey! Don't fucking do it!

1236
01:25:21,574 --> 01:25:23,084
He cocked it first.

1237
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:25,909
I'm not doing this again.
I'm not leaving him behind.

1238
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:28,205
We're all we got.

1239
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,400
- Get out the car.
- He's in the net up there.

1240
01:25:42,887 --> 01:25:45,177
Dude, little space.

1241
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:52,229
Die!

1242
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:01,570
Come on. Hurry, Seven.

1243
01:26:04,742 --> 01:26:05,992
Come on, come on, come on.

1244
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:08,752
I'm gonna kill you.

1245
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:10,497
No!

1246
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:13,837
Hurry, Seven.

1247
01:26:32,478 --> 01:26:33,478
Nice shot.

1248
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:36,323
Carvers.

1249
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:41,650
Cleavers.

1250
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:53,332
They're making war on me.

1251
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:56,456
My most loyal generals are dead,
and my brother is loose.

1252
01:26:56,544 --> 01:26:58,344
They're not shadows. They're men.

1253
01:26:58,421 --> 01:26:59,461
And women.

1254
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:02,507
Uncommonly skilled
in covering their tracks.

1255
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:05,362
Outside of their violence against you,
they appear not to exist at all.

1256
01:27:05,386 --> 01:27:08,176
You mean to tell me in a world
of cell phones and Internet browsers...

1257
01:27:08,264 --> 01:27:10,484
We have found no digital footprints.

1258
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:14,311
She was declared dead seven months ago.

1259
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:15,975
Your firm is helpless.

1260
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:19,781
I find people by examining their links
to the world,

1261
01:27:19,859 --> 01:27:23,989
to families, friends,
employers, organizations.

1262
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:28,872
Once I find a thread, I pull it
and keep pulling it until I reach them

1263
01:27:28,952 --> 01:27:30,952
so I can have my teams kill them.

1264
01:27:31,037 --> 01:27:32,247
How is this different?

1265
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:37,001
Whatever links to the world
these people had, they've cut them.

1266
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:38,875
And yet they walk the Earth
like you and me.

1267
01:27:39,754 --> 01:27:42,724
They have blood types and birthdays
and sock drawers.

1268
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:45,339
This ghost act is itself a form of hubris.

1269
01:27:45,885 --> 01:27:48,425
If they exist, they can be made not to.

1270
01:27:53,559 --> 01:27:54,559
We're good.

1271
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:10,591
This shit isn't sitting right with me,
man. You made me a promise.

1272
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:12,418
You said you'd always let me
pull the trigger.

1273
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:14,293
Yeah. Yeah, I did say that.

1274
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:16,172
- Yeah, you remember that?
- Okay, easy.

1275
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:18,919
- You know why we don't use names?
- Why?

1276
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:20,562
No offense, Four, I'm glad you're alive,

1277
01:28:20,586 --> 01:28:23,506
but you left us out on that street there.
We were totally exposed.

1278
01:28:23,589 --> 01:28:26,109
If I was up there, I'd expect you
to leave me and not turn back.

1279
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:28,070
- Fuck that.
- Mission is more important than the man.

1280
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:29,104
Fuck the mission.

1281
01:28:30,888 --> 01:28:33,268
- You don't leave a soldier behind.
- I got news for you.

1282
01:28:33,349 --> 01:28:36,689
Seven, you're not a soldier anymore.
She's not a doctor.

1283
01:28:36,769 --> 01:28:38,059
She's not a spy.

1284
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:41,146
- He's not a hitman. And I'm not a CEO.
- A rich asshole?

1285
01:28:41,232 --> 01:28:42,782
Oh, I am still a rich asshole.

1286
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:44,670
- I just don't have a name.
- You are. What's your name?

1287
01:28:44,694 --> 01:28:46,954
- Don't tell him.
- I'm Blaine.

1288
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:48,410
I just saved your life.

1289
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:50,330
What's your name?

1290
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:53,410
It's Billy.

1291
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:54,373
Billy.

1292
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:56,464
- You look like a Billy.
- You look like a Four.

1293
01:28:57,749 --> 01:28:58,789
I'm Javier.

1294
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:00,334
Camille.

1295
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:01,752
Amelia.

1296
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:04,922
It's nice to meet everyone. That's great.

1297
01:29:05,631 --> 01:29:07,221
That's great. Let's go, let's go.

1298
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:10,177
Great.

1299
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:14,055
Hey, ghosts.
This is Seven, AKA Blaine.

1300
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:16,390
We're below radar,
we're entering Turgistan airspace.

1301
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:18,346
That gives us four days
till Day of the Dead.

1302
01:29:24,317 --> 01:29:25,897
Concentric circles.

1303
01:29:25,985 --> 01:29:28,695
Your enemy's radius of operations
is shrinking.

1304
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:29,910
Thirty-eight hours ago,

1305
01:29:29,989 --> 01:29:33,329
an unidentified aircraft vanished
off-radar near Tyrus.

1306
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:37,615
It filed no flight plan,
it ignored control and then disappeared.

1307
01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:50,722
Two, Three, you hustling?

1308
01:29:51,135 --> 01:29:52,175
Speed it up.

1309
01:29:53,513 --> 01:29:54,353
Don't drop it.

1310
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:55,850
It's a two-block walk. Come on.

1311
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:01,651
Funny guy. What is your number?

1312
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:04,859
One, Two, Three? Whatever it is.
My number is Zero.

1313
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:06,821
I'm doing jack ass here.

1314
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:11,275
You got the biggest job of all 'cause
none of this matters if you don't step up.

1315
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:13,204
They will catch all of us!

1316
01:30:13,282 --> 01:30:14,492
Can I ask you something?

1317
01:30:14,575 --> 01:30:16,985
If you had one shot,

1318
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:19,580
one opportunity
to seize everything that you ever wanted

1319
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:23,084
in one moment,
would you capture it or let it slip?

1320
01:30:27,338 --> 01:30:28,338
Was that, uh...

1321
01:30:28,798 --> 01:30:29,798
Was that Eminem?

1322
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:33,592
- Yes.
- You gave me fucking goosebumps.

1323
01:30:34,762 --> 01:30:38,062
If I do whatever you're asking me to do,
my brother will cut off my head.

1324
01:30:38,141 --> 01:30:41,101
And he loves cutting heads.
And believe me,

1325
01:30:41,185 --> 01:30:43,725
compared to what he will do
with you ghosts, this is nothing.

1326
01:30:43,813 --> 01:30:45,693
Arm them. Click to the right.

1327
01:30:47,316 --> 01:30:49,776
I wonder how many people you have to kill
to get one of these.

1328
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:02,624
We're at the TV relay.

1329
01:31:09,755 --> 01:31:10,755
Hey, are you afraid?

1330
01:31:14,218 --> 01:31:15,048
He's in.

1331
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:17,886
Three little words
have helped dictators rule:

1332
01:31:19,098 --> 01:31:21,478
State-run television.

1333
01:31:26,939 --> 01:31:29,319
We're gonna become
the new heads of programming...

1334
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,120
Inverter's in place.

1335
01:31:32,278 --> 01:31:34,028
...and you're gonna be
our new spokesperson.

1336
01:31:36,073 --> 01:31:39,413
After his national address,
he'll have a big party on his yacht.

1337
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:43,410
If we're gonna flush Rovach to his yacht,

1338
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:45,538
we need to disable security at his palace,

1339
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,790
which means
a crippling surge of electricity,

1340
01:31:47,877 --> 01:31:51,377
which means an unannounced visit
to a state-run power generator.

1341
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:55,514
This one's highly defended, no back doors,
so we walk through the front.

1342
01:31:56,052 --> 01:31:57,932
All right, guys. You're clear to the gate.

1343
01:31:58,012 --> 01:32:00,972
Never underestimate the power
of a very nice suit.

1344
01:32:02,433 --> 01:32:05,233
Remember, they don't like Americans.

1345
01:32:05,311 --> 01:32:07,151
Everything's looking good. They're in.

1346
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:08,560
Cheeks on seats.

1347
01:32:22,745 --> 01:32:24,025
Manchester.

1348
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:27,580
Manchester and Farquarson.
We've got a website, look it up.

1349
01:32:27,667 --> 01:32:29,787
Inspection is our business.
That's the slogan.

1350
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:30,797
And your name again?

1351
01:32:30,878 --> 01:32:32,258
My name is Mr. Worthington,

1352
01:32:32,338 --> 01:32:35,298
- and this is my associate, Mr. Ferijips...
- Ferjelpo.

1353
01:32:35,341 --> 01:32:36,551
Surjepo.

1354
01:32:37,009 --> 01:32:38,009
And he's from...

1355
01:32:38,094 --> 01:32:39,144
Turgistan.

1356
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:41,761
- Turgistan.
- Turgistan.

1357
01:32:41,847 --> 01:32:42,927
You want soup?

1358
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:44,978
Got any booze in there?

1359
01:32:46,894 --> 01:32:47,944
No.

1360
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:50,150
- Cup. Compliment his wife.
- Is that your wife?

1361
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:52,190
It's my daughter.

1362
01:32:56,571 --> 01:32:57,781
Uh...

1363
01:32:59,407 --> 01:33:01,277
It's hard living out here, isn't it?

1364
01:33:02,368 --> 01:33:03,998
She come out full grown?

1365
01:33:04,078 --> 01:33:06,288
Faked me out there
with the gray hair and the wrinkles

1366
01:33:06,372 --> 01:33:08,622
- and the orthopedic shoes and...
- What do you want?

1367
01:33:08,708 --> 01:33:10,038
An unannounced stress test.

1368
01:33:10,501 --> 01:33:12,131
Plants three through seven, they passed.

1369
01:33:12,211 --> 01:33:14,261
And I have no doubt that you will, too.
All right.

1370
01:33:14,338 --> 01:33:15,718
The only failure was at plant two.

1371
01:33:15,798 --> 01:33:16,838
You know, that was very...

1372
01:33:16,924 --> 01:33:18,014
Plant two failed?

1373
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:19,842
..minor. Yes, so, you know Mr. Noor?

1374
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:22,047
- We're trying to keep his name out of it.
- Yeah.

1375
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:23,598
Noor is a fool.

1376
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:27,017
Yeah.

1377
01:33:28,686 --> 01:33:31,516
- Noor is dead. Say he's dead.
- No, he's dead.

1378
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:32,646
He died.

1379
01:33:32,732 --> 01:33:34,692
Wrong guy. He's alive. Fuck!

1380
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:40,493
Just recover. Recover.

1381
01:33:40,906 --> 01:33:42,776
Yeah. He was found with a belt...

1382
01:33:43,701 --> 01:33:46,541
tied around his neck
in an unfortunate masturbating accident.

1383
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:50,789
Ferocious masturbating accident.

1384
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:52,289
It was very sad.

1385
01:33:52,376 --> 01:33:53,876
One, shut the fuck up.

1386
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:56,460
- What?
- Come on. We've all choked ourselves

1387
01:33:56,547 --> 01:33:58,167
having a little choke, haven't we?

1388
01:34:01,844 --> 01:34:02,844
Come.

1389
01:34:03,346 --> 01:34:05,216
And this is our finest room.

1390
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:09,226
It transmits all state-run television
and power to the palace.

1391
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:10,440
Very efficient.

1392
01:34:13,356 --> 01:34:17,106
Maybe Mr. Grace can mention it
to Mr. Bashir.

1393
01:34:18,110 --> 01:34:19,240
I doubt it.

1394
01:34:21,739 --> 01:34:23,239
Does it ever bother you, bro?

1395
01:34:23,741 --> 01:34:26,201
To mean nothing to anyone.

1396
01:34:27,203 --> 01:34:31,463
Like, one wrong word in there,
and they go find themselves an Eight?

1397
01:34:31,874 --> 01:34:32,794
Nine?

1398
01:34:32,875 --> 01:34:34,335
Why do you think I chose you?

1399
01:34:35,044 --> 01:34:37,134
A man whose longest relationship's
with a rifle.

1400
01:34:37,213 --> 01:34:39,633
You don't know my fucking life, bro.

1401
01:34:40,216 --> 01:34:43,296
You can't do the stuff that we do
and have someone you love.

1402
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:44,596
It doesn't... It doesn't work.

1403
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:47,599
Everybody's got someone
or something to lose, man.

1404
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:49,516
Even you.

1405
01:34:51,644 --> 01:34:56,324
No, I... I'm gonna leave this world
the same way that I came into it.

1406
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:58,284
Alone, thank you.

1407
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:02,240
You can drop the boo-hoo bullshit
'cause I see through it.

1408
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:04,948
You were good in there.

1409
01:35:05,032 --> 01:35:07,082
- I know.
- Yeah, that Turkmen was garbage.

1410
01:35:07,159 --> 01:35:08,489
Fuck you.

1411
01:35:09,245 --> 01:35:11,615
You've got a soul, man.
You should let it out.

1412
01:35:19,755 --> 01:35:21,965
Presidente, we go live in five minutes.

1413
01:35:29,974 --> 01:35:31,201
When the shit goes down,

1414
01:35:31,225 --> 01:35:33,885
presidential protocol is
they take him to his yacht.

1415
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:36,309
They store him in a stateroom.

1416
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:37,897
It's hardened like a bunker.

1417
01:35:40,484 --> 01:35:43,454
Wow! It's so big!

1418
01:35:56,667 --> 01:35:57,947
How you doing, Mama?

1419
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:01,340
Three, set at palace.

1420
01:36:09,638 --> 01:36:10,808
It's beautiful.

1421
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:12,432
Thank you.

1422
01:36:13,142 --> 01:36:14,482
I just threw it together.

1423
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:17,900
The route to Rovach's boat
will take about an hour.

1424
01:36:19,106 --> 01:36:20,436
We need every second.

1425
01:36:25,154 --> 01:36:26,994
You know, none of us will be remembered.

1426
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:32,660
What's about to happen will.

1427
01:36:35,581 --> 01:36:38,251
Little things, they add up to big things.

1428
01:36:43,255 --> 01:36:44,835
Let's go change the world.

1429
01:36:57,561 --> 01:36:58,731
Hey, One.

1430
01:36:58,813 --> 01:36:59,853
I'm freaking the fuck out.

1431
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,440
My fellow countrymen, well...

1432
01:37:05,528 --> 01:37:06,568
No, I can't do this.

1433
01:37:06,654 --> 01:37:08,074
I can't go live.

1434
01:37:09,156 --> 01:37:10,156
Uh...

1435
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:16,206
My brothers and, uh, my sisters.

1436
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:18,118
I'm here to teach.

1437
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:21,338
It's time for a revolution.

1438
01:37:21,418 --> 01:37:25,588
For so many years, our people
have suffered under my brother.

1439
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:26,723
Free yourself,

1440
01:37:26,799 --> 01:37:27,879
rise up.

1441
01:37:27,967 --> 01:37:29,507
Set us free.

1442
01:37:29,593 --> 01:37:31,183
It's time for a revolution.

1443
01:37:47,069 --> 01:37:48,149
Who picked this?

1444
01:37:49,321 --> 01:37:50,241
You're welcome.

1445
01:37:50,322 --> 01:37:51,822
- It's a good song.
- This... No.

1446
01:37:51,907 --> 01:37:54,537
- It's perfect.
- That is subjective.

1447
01:37:54,618 --> 01:37:57,618
 Than give up the fight
Give up the fight, give up the fight

1448
01:38:01,709 --> 01:38:02,869
Rise up

1449
01:38:02,918 --> 01:38:04,838
and let's take our country back.

1450
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:15,010
We'll see if this works.

1451
01:38:39,622 --> 01:38:41,542
- No. I don't really care.
- Power's out.

1452
01:38:41,624 --> 01:38:43,334
Just tell me. Who the fuck is it?

1453
01:38:43,417 --> 01:38:45,787
State TV are compromised.
It's showing everywhere.

1454
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:47,418
We are under attack.

1455
01:38:58,682 --> 01:38:59,910
- Breakthrough...
- BBC...

1456
01:38:59,934 --> 01:39:02,314
- Breaking news...
- A coup is underway...

1457
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:06,970
Every man we've got,
fully armed and tacked.

1458
01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:15,408
All right, guys, here they come.

1459
01:39:21,914 --> 01:39:23,834
I'm counting cars.
It's like a fucking parade.

1460
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:26,671
Murat, go.

1461
01:39:41,767 --> 01:39:43,387
Scramble all squadrons.

1462
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:45,767
Bring in strike fighters to escort me.

1463
01:39:45,854 --> 01:39:48,324
Replace traditional ordnance
with sarin VX.

1464
01:39:48,732 --> 01:39:50,282
Start on my word.

1465
01:39:54,279 --> 01:39:56,739
Why is it always me
that has to do this kind of shit, man?

1466
01:39:58,993 --> 01:40:02,333
Hey, Chatty Cathy.
Do you know what over and out means?

1467
01:40:02,413 --> 01:40:04,503
I'm a little afraid.
What do you want me to say?

1468
01:40:04,581 --> 01:40:06,211
Conversation's over. Capisce?

1469
01:40:06,291 --> 01:40:09,501
There's a lot of bad guys,
and I'm the only good guy here. Move!

1470
01:40:09,586 --> 01:40:11,876
If I die, just tell my mother
that I love her.

1471
01:40:11,964 --> 01:40:13,304
Over and out!

1472
01:40:17,302 --> 01:40:19,642
They poke the nest,
they're gonna find hornets.

1473
01:40:37,239 --> 01:40:39,579
Oh, okay, papi. They have fighter jets.

1474
01:40:39,658 --> 01:40:41,198
They have fighter jets, man.

1475
01:40:45,122 --> 01:40:46,122
Is this gonna work?

1476
01:40:46,582 --> 01:40:47,582
Well...

1477
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:51,630
I hope so.

1478
01:40:51,712 --> 01:40:52,712
We better hurry.

1479
01:41:08,937 --> 01:41:09,937
Where'd you get these?

1480
01:41:10,689 --> 01:41:11,769
It's the pro shit.

1481
01:41:12,274 --> 01:41:13,614
Ghost guns.

1482
01:41:13,692 --> 01:41:16,452
Ceramic barrels,
plastic frames, plastic mags.

1483
01:41:24,661 --> 01:41:26,461
These are no longer my people.

1484
01:41:26,538 --> 01:41:28,418
Through that crowd. Through that crowd!

1485
01:41:34,004 --> 01:41:35,264
No, you evil fuck!

1486
01:41:49,269 --> 01:41:51,479
This is where you ask me if I'm afraid.

1487
01:41:51,563 --> 01:41:53,573
Right now, I'm shit scared.

1488
01:42:03,784 --> 01:42:06,334
Dropping one! Two!

1489
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:09,001
Three! Four!

1490
01:42:15,337 --> 01:42:16,337
Drive. Drive fast.

1491
01:42:29,059 --> 01:42:30,439
What's the status, Three?

1492
01:42:30,519 --> 01:42:33,059
I'm good. Just making the world
a better place, that's all.

1493
01:42:48,245 --> 01:42:49,995
Go! Go! Let's go!

1494
01:42:51,540 --> 01:42:53,790
TOT, let's go, let's go, let's go!

1495
01:42:53,876 --> 01:42:55,956
Hey, Four,
you've gotta sabotage that anchor.

1496
01:42:56,044 --> 01:42:57,344
See you on the other side.

1497
01:43:04,094 --> 01:43:05,514
Open the bridge.

1498
01:43:05,596 --> 01:43:06,596
All the way.

1499
01:43:09,808 --> 01:43:11,438
Don't start the party without me.

1500
01:43:13,061 --> 01:43:14,311
Time clock. Guys.

1501
01:43:14,396 --> 01:43:15,726
Let's go. Go.

1502
01:43:23,906 --> 01:43:25,816
President. Ready to go underway.

1503
01:43:47,304 --> 01:43:48,354
Hello.

1504
01:43:57,898 --> 01:43:58,898
Why are we not moving?

1505
01:44:00,776 --> 01:44:02,066
Cauliflower is very nice.

1506
01:44:02,152 --> 01:44:04,322
- I wanna move!
- I told the captain to move.

1507
01:44:04,404 --> 01:44:06,914
- There's nothing more I can do.
- I want to move right now!

1508
01:44:06,990 --> 01:44:08,740
He's German. He's very precise.

1509
01:44:08,825 --> 01:44:10,655
Start the engines. Prepare to leave.

1510
01:44:20,796 --> 01:44:22,456
Side door is opening.

1511
01:44:40,357 --> 01:44:41,897
Take the wheel! Take the wheel!

1512
01:44:53,996 --> 01:44:54,906
Lock the boat down.

1513
01:44:54,997 --> 01:44:56,497
Everyone, strap on body armor,

1514
01:44:56,581 --> 01:44:58,081
and tell the captain let's get going.

1515
01:45:00,877 --> 01:45:02,247
Captain of the Kismet.

1516
01:45:02,337 --> 01:45:03,547
I need military escort.

1517
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:05,970
Not so fast. We're gonna stay and party.
Get down.

1518
01:45:06,049 --> 01:45:07,929
Down. Get down. On your knees.

1519
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:10,180
- All right.
- Show me your hands, por favor.

1520
01:45:10,721 --> 01:45:11,761
Two hands!

1521
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:18,265
This is Turgistan security
on the Kismet. Pirates have just...

1522
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,564
Comms cut. We're good.

1523
01:45:27,195 --> 01:45:28,695
- Bonjour.
- Hi.

1524
01:45:28,780 --> 01:45:29,780
- Hey.
- Hi.

1525
01:45:33,368 --> 01:45:34,408
Hey, papi.

1526
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:45,960
Listen closely.

1527
01:45:47,049 --> 01:45:48,379
The enemy is us.

1528
01:45:49,051 --> 01:45:51,721
We must target him not where he is strong
but where he's weak.

1529
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:54,600
Hospitals, to take away his safety.

1530
01:45:55,098 --> 01:45:57,678
Schools, to take away his future.

1531
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:01,480
Youth, to suffocate his hope.

1532
01:46:01,563 --> 01:46:02,403
Stop.

1533
01:46:02,481 --> 01:46:04,459
- Commence gas attack.
- Get out of my way.

1534
01:46:04,483 --> 01:46:05,483
Do it now.

1535
01:46:06,651 --> 01:46:07,741
Do it!

1536
01:46:08,153 --> 01:46:09,153
I said do...

1537
01:46:09,654 --> 01:46:11,074
Join me, brothers.

1538
01:46:11,156 --> 01:46:13,446
So you don't have to kill
your own people again.

1539
01:46:14,576 --> 01:46:17,156
Tell the military to back away
from that boat.

1540
01:46:17,704 --> 01:46:21,174
Together, we will bring peace
to our beloved country.

1541
01:46:22,084 --> 01:46:23,094
We're good.

1542
01:46:24,252 --> 01:46:25,842
Guards have chest armor.

1543
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:26,921
Yes, they do.

1544
01:46:26,963 --> 01:46:29,843
We got the fancy composite Kevlar.
I hope this works, man.

1545
01:46:29,925 --> 01:46:32,165
- It'll work.
- They have some fancy food up there.

1546
01:46:32,219 --> 01:46:34,179
Really? Tell me more about that.
Don't hold back.

1547
01:46:34,262 --> 01:46:38,812
This fish soup they call...
labu... labuan...

1548
01:46:38,892 --> 01:46:40,232
I'm fucking kidding. Focus.

1549
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:42,770
It's so delicious, man.
They put this little cheese on it.

1550
01:46:43,313 --> 01:46:46,943
Does it have to be on the walkie-talkie?
And we're all standing right here. Yeah?

1551
01:46:47,359 --> 01:46:49,069
Don't you give me attitude, okay?

1552
01:46:49,152 --> 01:46:51,612
- Over and out.
- I...

1553
01:46:51,696 --> 01:46:55,076
Don't scratch my boat with your guns.
It cost me one billion manat.

1554
01:47:08,588 --> 01:47:11,878
When I pop this,
the magnet pulse lasts for 15 seconds.

1555
01:47:17,264 --> 01:47:19,434
Welcome to the world's biggest magnet.

1556
01:47:22,477 --> 01:47:25,687
I was thinking that when this is over,
I want you to meet my mother, yes?

1557
01:47:26,148 --> 01:47:28,188
Oh, God. You didn't say that.

1558
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:29,985
What? Yes, I said it.

1559
01:47:31,695 --> 01:47:33,105
What's wrong with you people?

1560
01:47:40,745 --> 01:47:42,575
Ooh! Big guns.

1561
01:47:42,873 --> 01:47:43,923
Ooh, la la!

1562
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:47,380
I found the back doors to Rovach's suite.

1563
01:47:55,594 --> 01:47:56,804
Fuck!

1564
01:47:59,973 --> 01:48:01,643
Ah, fucking American-made!

1565
01:48:05,061 --> 01:48:06,441
The fucking chip fell out.

1566
01:48:07,105 --> 01:48:08,105
- What?
- What?

1567
01:48:08,190 --> 01:48:09,940
- The chip fell out!
- Well, fix it.

1568
01:48:10,025 --> 01:48:13,985
I can't just fix it, all right?
The phone is very fucking complicated.

1569
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:18,830
No. No, no, no, no. No, no.
Go. Go, go, go.

1570
01:48:19,367 --> 01:48:21,929
- Sir, please, we must leave right now.
- Hungry. I went for a dip.

1571
01:48:21,953 --> 01:48:23,431
- I'm important guest.
- We have to...

1572
01:48:23,455 --> 01:48:24,775
I just went for a dip, all right?

1573
01:48:24,831 --> 01:48:26,631
This is succulent chicken, man.

1574
01:48:27,083 --> 01:48:28,883
- Show me your hands.
- This couscous?

1575
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:31,170
Show me your hands!

1576
01:48:33,423 --> 01:48:34,423
Fine.

1577
01:48:35,675 --> 01:48:36,675
Hey.

1578
01:48:37,135 --> 01:48:38,175
You know what?

1579
01:48:39,346 --> 01:48:40,966
I would love to meet your mother.

1580
01:48:41,723 --> 01:48:42,893
Really?

1581
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:05,620
I'm really happy.

1582
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:08,750
Contact!

1583
01:49:16,383 --> 01:49:17,383
Come on.

1584
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:26,540
- What the fuck?
- One!

1585
01:49:28,687 --> 01:49:31,897
- What the fuck?
- Put the phone down, and use your gun.

1586
01:49:40,282 --> 01:49:41,452
I got it, I got it! I got it!

1587
01:49:44,327 --> 01:49:46,077
Grenade!

1588
01:50:03,305 --> 01:50:04,305
Gah!

1589
01:50:13,106 --> 01:50:14,106
Oh!

1590
01:50:41,885 --> 01:50:44,675
Holy shit!
I mean, I wasn't sure it would work.

1591
01:50:44,763 --> 01:50:47,683
I mean, I wasn't "sure" sure.
I had a suspicion, but I, uh...

1592
01:50:48,058 --> 01:50:50,098
God, this is all so fucking dangerous.

1593
01:50:50,185 --> 01:50:51,185
Move!

1594
01:50:54,189 --> 01:50:55,189
Hey, hey!

1595
01:50:55,231 --> 01:50:56,981
You like that phone now, motherfucker?

1596
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:58,400
This thing is amazing.

1597
01:50:59,319 --> 01:51:01,399
Stop fucking around. We gotta find Rovach.

1598
01:51:05,158 --> 01:51:06,488
Oh, shit. What happened?

1599
01:51:06,951 --> 01:51:08,541
What the fuck?

1600
01:51:20,799 --> 01:51:22,549
Jesus. What did you do?

1601
01:51:22,634 --> 01:51:24,014
You goddamn animals.

1602
01:51:24,094 --> 01:51:25,684
Don't look at me. She's the evil one.

1603
01:51:26,096 --> 01:51:27,636
- You did this?
- Yeah.

1604
01:51:27,722 --> 01:51:29,033
- Why?
- If we don't move quick,

1605
01:51:29,057 --> 01:51:31,307
- they're gonna pull them from the boat.
- You're sick.

1606
01:51:31,393 --> 01:51:32,693
Disgusting.

1607
01:51:35,522 --> 01:51:36,732
Let's find Rovach.

1608
01:51:53,164 --> 01:51:54,254
Let's go.

1609
01:52:08,555 --> 01:52:09,755
More guys coming.

1610
01:52:11,516 --> 01:52:12,726
Flashbang!

1611
01:52:12,809 --> 01:52:14,189
Move it here!

1612
01:52:28,575 --> 01:52:29,575
Move, move.

1613
01:52:35,665 --> 01:52:37,825
- The boat's moving.
- That's bad.

1614
01:52:39,919 --> 01:52:41,249
Mag!

1615
01:52:42,338 --> 01:52:45,088
- Magnet! Where is the magnet?
- They're getting their guns!

1616
01:52:46,718 --> 01:52:48,798
- Fix the phone!
- I'm trying!

1617
01:52:49,596 --> 01:52:51,716
The screen is cracked!

1618
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:56,810
We get it! They're dead!

1619
01:52:57,228 --> 01:52:59,558
Shit. They got our position.
We need to move.

1620
01:52:59,647 --> 01:53:02,027
Honestly, I didn't think
we'd make it this far.

1621
01:53:02,567 --> 01:53:04,107
Go kill the engine.

1622
01:53:18,041 --> 01:53:19,751
That is disgusting!

1623
01:53:19,834 --> 01:53:20,884
It was a flashbang.

1624
01:53:21,336 --> 01:53:22,456
Holy shit.

1625
01:53:23,463 --> 01:53:24,923
We should split up.

1626
01:53:28,301 --> 01:53:29,391
Go with him.

1627
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:31,470
Get me to the boat.

1628
01:53:39,229 --> 01:53:42,649
You. Where's Rovach?

1629
01:53:52,075 --> 01:53:53,195
I feel like a Jedi.

1630
01:54:02,919 --> 01:54:04,339
Five, flush him out.

1631
01:54:27,735 --> 01:54:29,775
Five, find Rovach.
I'll distract the guards.

1632
01:54:35,326 --> 01:54:36,326
I wouldn't do that.

1633
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:55,010
We're sinking.

1634
01:55:01,185 --> 01:55:04,105
I've got four guys on me.
I'm on the upper deck, and I'm screwed.

1635
01:55:07,275 --> 01:55:08,605
Who are you?

1636
01:55:08,943 --> 01:55:10,493
He's up there! On top!

1637
01:55:16,242 --> 01:55:17,242
No, no, no!

1638
01:55:23,333 --> 01:55:24,253
Come on!

1639
01:55:24,334 --> 01:55:27,054
Oh, no. Wait. Wait. I got it.

1640
01:55:29,130 --> 01:55:31,170
Big motherfucker.

1641
01:55:57,909 --> 01:56:00,069
I almost shot you right in the head.

1642
01:56:00,119 --> 01:56:01,579
Goddamn it. You go eat some food.

1643
01:56:01,663 --> 01:56:02,793
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

1644
01:56:02,872 --> 01:56:03,872
No, you fuck you.

1645
01:56:07,126 --> 01:56:09,626
I'm in Rovach's stateroom.

1646
01:56:10,964 --> 01:56:13,554
- Get me to the rescue boat.
- One.

1647
01:56:14,133 --> 01:56:15,593
Rovach is leaving with a guard.

1648
01:56:15,677 --> 01:56:17,007
What do you want me to do?

1649
01:56:17,095 --> 01:56:18,095
Four, where you at?

1650
01:56:23,267 --> 01:56:24,137
One, please!

1651
01:56:24,227 --> 01:56:25,477
- Four?
- Help me!

1652
01:56:25,561 --> 01:56:26,561
Give me a hint, buddy.

1653
01:56:31,109 --> 01:56:32,859
Get me out of this boat.

1654
01:56:34,070 --> 01:56:34,900
What's your 20?

1655
01:56:34,988 --> 01:56:36,318
Anybody got eyes on the target?

1656
01:56:36,406 --> 01:56:39,196
I don't know my 20. Stay off the channel.
I'm going for Four.

1657
01:56:39,450 --> 01:56:42,290
- Four, where you at, buddy?
- You're breaking your own rules.

1658
01:56:44,497 --> 01:56:46,247
I thought you didn't have a family.

1659
01:57:02,849 --> 01:57:03,979
Presidente!

1660
01:57:13,192 --> 01:57:14,492
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1661
01:57:17,572 --> 01:57:19,372
It's a big ship. Say something, pal.

1662
01:57:20,992 --> 01:57:21,992
He's gonna kill me.

1663
01:57:22,410 --> 01:57:24,410
Look, Bond, you gotta get here fast.

1664
01:57:34,338 --> 01:57:35,758
There you are.

1665
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:36,720
Cleavers.

1666
01:57:36,799 --> 01:57:37,799
What?

1667
01:57:37,842 --> 01:57:39,552
It's a TV show. Come on, let's go.

1668
01:57:39,635 --> 01:57:41,005
Fucking millennials.

1669
01:57:41,095 --> 01:57:42,505
Ship's sinking. Come on.

1670
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:13,460
They're all in.

1671
01:58:34,816 --> 01:58:37,526
As fast as she can fly
to the villa in Dezar.

1672
01:58:37,610 --> 01:58:39,030
They sunk my boat.

1673
01:58:41,030 --> 01:58:43,530
I was thinking of somewhere else.

1674
01:58:48,079 --> 01:58:50,369
- Hey.
- I'll blow your fucking head off!

1675
01:58:53,918 --> 01:58:54,958
Who are you?

1676
01:58:55,419 --> 01:58:56,419
No one.

1677
01:59:06,514 --> 01:59:07,524
Murat!

1678
01:59:19,026 --> 01:59:21,380
In Turgistan,
we're witnessing a regime change.

1679
01:59:21,404 --> 01:59:23,340
We're following a major breaking story.

1680
01:59:23,364 --> 01:59:24,508
Country's overthrown...

1681
01:59:24,532 --> 01:59:26,051
Countries around the world

1682
01:59:26,075 --> 01:59:27,555
are now mobilizing to give them help.

1683
01:59:27,618 --> 01:59:30,158
Refugee camps are emptying.
It's an amazing sight to see.

1684
01:59:39,380 --> 01:59:41,670
We're following a major breaking story.

1685
01:59:41,757 --> 01:59:44,927
We understand now that
they're dropping Rovach off to rebels.

1686
02:00:14,248 --> 02:00:15,418
I know you.

1687
02:00:17,168 --> 02:00:18,208
From the opera, right?

1688
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:21,010
- Welcome to Act Five.
- I knew it.

1689
02:00:21,756 --> 02:00:22,966
What are you gonna do?

1690
02:00:28,221 --> 02:00:29,221
Murat!

1691
02:00:29,722 --> 02:00:30,812
I'm your brother!

1692
02:00:32,475 --> 02:00:34,475
You didn't listen to me, Brother.

1693
02:00:36,187 --> 02:00:37,477
Kill me here, huh?

1694
02:00:38,981 --> 02:00:40,401
I wanna die with dignity.

1695
02:00:41,108 --> 02:00:41,938
Kill me here.

1696
02:00:42,026 --> 02:00:43,026
Kill me here!

1697
02:00:45,029 --> 02:00:46,069
Kill me!

1698
02:00:50,159 --> 02:00:51,539
Kill me right now.

1699
02:01:01,337 --> 02:01:02,627
Don't let them touch me.

1700
02:01:02,713 --> 02:01:04,303
Shoot me right now!

1701
02:01:09,470 --> 02:01:10,470
Murat!

1702
02:01:12,306 --> 02:01:13,716
No! No!

1703
02:02:05,484 --> 02:02:06,494
Truth?

1704
02:02:08,404 --> 02:02:10,534
I have no idea what happens when you die.

1705
02:02:11,699 --> 02:02:13,119
Death's still a mystery.

1706
02:02:18,998 --> 02:02:20,248
But life...

1707
02:02:22,626 --> 02:02:23,836
a little less so.

1708
02:02:27,131 --> 02:02:28,131
Alone...

1709
02:02:30,092 --> 02:02:31,432
we walk the Earth...

1710
02:02:33,637 --> 02:02:34,637
quiet.

1711
02:02:38,559 --> 02:02:39,769
But together?

1712
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:42,560
As a team?

1713
02:02:44,815 --> 02:02:46,645
Oh, we can do some shit...

1714
02:02:48,152 --> 02:02:49,902
awfully loud.

1715
02:02:52,698 --> 02:02:54,988
They say that your soul departs
when you pass.

1716
02:02:58,662 --> 02:03:00,872
Well, for us, it was the opposite.

1717
02:03:05,836 --> 02:03:07,836
The moment nothing to lose...

1718
02:03:09,882 --> 02:03:11,592
became something to gain.

1719
02:05:10,044 --> 02:05:11,884
And the whole wide world...

1720
02:05:13,130 --> 02:05:14,590
seemed a little less haunted.

1721
02:05:15,883 --> 02:05:17,223
I am one...

1722
02:05:17,927 --> 02:05:18,927
but not done.

1723
02:05:34,777 --> 02:05:37,817
Next time,
can we just knock off a fucking casino?
