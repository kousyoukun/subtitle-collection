1
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,670
(girl) Swords and staves.

2
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,049
Tough road you got this year.

3
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,136
Judgement... Death...

4
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,514
..and Mr Devil.

5
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,559
I'm glad it's your birthday reading
and not mine.

6
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:04,021
Now here's your card, Fool. See?

7
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,441
- That's where I got your nickname.
- (boy) Don't remind me!

8
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,318
Here you go. 13 today.

9
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:13,447
The golden-haired birthday boy is
settin' off on life's big adventure.

10
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:17,534
I ain't no golden-haired nobody!
All I'm goin' on to is seventh grade.

11
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,246
Well, you're the Fool, and you
can't escape that. That ain't bad.

12
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:24,833
- No?
- No. Ain't the stupid kind of fool.

13
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,503
The ignorant kind,
cos you're just startin' out.

14
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,505
That's better, I guess.

15
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:33,717
Ah, but look here.
Already he's got a problem, see?

16
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,720
One step in front - the drop-off.

17
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:41,391
- What about the dog?
- That's Fool's companion.

18
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,477
See his spirit barking?

19
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,355
"Fool! Don't go marching
over that cliff, now."

20
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,399
"Do the smart thing. The high thing."

21
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:53,278
So what Fool gonna do if he ain't
gonna go off the cliff? Fly?

22
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,447
He gonna do what he have to, Fool.

23
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:59,660
Turn around and walk the other way,
right through the fire of the sun.

24
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,829
He'll get burned up if he do that.

25
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,164
Just the boy part get burned up.

26
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,334
The rest come out the other side a man.

27
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,003
And no one calls him "Fool" again.

28
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,674
(woman coughing)

29
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:19,429
(girl) Just try to sleep, Mama.
There's nothing you can do.

30
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,015
- Sh.
- (coughing)

31
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,309
Sh.

32
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,728
Just rest, Mom.

33
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,027
Oh. (coughs)

34
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:38,157
I don't know what to do with this, Ruby.

35
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,326
I didn't think the landlord would do this.

36
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,037
Not now.

37
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:48,167
- Fool, you shouldn't be here.
- Fool, go back to reading your book.

38
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,170
- What's wrong?
- Nothing you can do. Go on.

39
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,358
(Lighter clicks)

40
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,862
Who are you?

41
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,700
Leroy. A friend of Ruby's.

42
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:26,288
You the little brother she call Fool?

43
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:30,792
My real name's Poindexter,
but Ruby's hung up on them tarot cards.

44
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,340
Why Mama cryin'?

45
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:40,844
Y'all been evicted. You gotta
be out tomorrow at midnight.

46
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,931
I guess Ruby didn't see
that one in the cards.

47
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,016
But why?

48
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,602
You're three days late
with your payment.

49
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:52,564
The fine print in the lease says
you gotta pay triple or else get out.

50
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,608
Your mama and Ruby ain't got triple.

51
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:58,862
Well, don't the landlord know that...
that Mama's sick,...

52
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:02,741
- ..or Ruby got babies?
- Yeah, sure. He knows. He don't care.

53
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:07,371
He wants to tear down the building.
You're the last family in it.

54
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,123
You got some money you can kick in?

55
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,635
I know a way you can earn some.

56
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,096
You game?

57
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:45,367
One last family in the Lenox Avenue
building, then it's clear to tear down.

58
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:49,871
We build a nice neat condominium,
we get clean people in there.

59
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,624
Lots of nice wood for my fireplace,
lots of nice...

60
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,502
- Money.
- And money.

61
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,504
For me.

62
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,967
Mama, what happens to the people
when you make them leave their home?

63
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,261
I don't believe I was speaking to you.

64
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,472
Speak when spoken to,
that's what good girls do.

65
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:11,059
- You getting them out soon?
- By tomorrow midnight.

66
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,857
Damn buckshot.

67
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,513
(man #1) Hey, Fool. I hear
you're gettin' evicted, man.

68
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,767
(man #2) Your ass will be out on
the street like the rest of us!

69
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,144
Hey, come back here!

70
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,073
(savage barking)

71
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,205
Hi, Fool.

72
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:18,418
(Ruby) He don't need that kind
of opportunity. He's a good kid.

73
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:22,881
He'd do better than the rest of you.
Out of seven, three's already dead.

74
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:26,551
Then there's you, baby,
turnin' tricks on the strip.

75
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:30,097
Willy's a crack addict,
and what's the other one's name, in jail?

76
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:34,768
- Washington. And he didn't do nothin'.
- He tried to put food on the damn table.

77
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,187
That's what I'm tryin'
to teach the boy to do.

78
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,482
- He wants to be a doctor.
- You can't even afford to pay rent!

79
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,443
How are you gonna afford
to send him to medical school?

80
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,279
- It ain't right anyway.
- Oh, that right?

81
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:51,034
Your mama got a cancer in her
she can't afford to have taken out.

82
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
Leroy!

83
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,830
A thing any doctor could
take outjust like that.

84
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:58,583
But you ain't got no money! And you
ain't gonna have no money unless...

85
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,961
Ow! You little snot!

86
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,130
Don't touch me. Don't touch me!

87
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,466
You listen up, you little punk. Listen up!

88
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,886
Now, this is the big one,
and somebody deserve to be robbed...

89
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:13,306
..somebody who don't care about families
or the neighbourhood.

90
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:18,103
He just wanna bring the wreckin' ball in
so he can line his pockets.

91
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,480
Who you talkin' about?

92
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,734
The landlord, that's who.

93
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,237
- The landlord of this building?
- Yeah.

94
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:31,700
I found the treasure map last night
in the liquor store, me and Spenser.

95
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:35,787
A letter addressed to the owner,
along with the name of his company.

96
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,790
- So?
- So the name of the company...

97
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,210
..is the same as the name
on your eviction notice.

98
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:46,798
Same guy who owns the liquor store
owns half the buildings in the ghetto.

99
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,593
I know where your landlord lives.

100
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,389
No.

101
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:58,143
Leave him alone. I heard things about him.

102
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,854
- Bad things.
- You heard about the gold?

103
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:08,612
This is from the company that wants to
buy the coins the landlord collected.

104
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:13,533
- Gold coins.
- You wanna be stupid, Leroy,...

105
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:17,662
- ...you don't need Fool for that.
- We got a plan for him, baby.

106
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:20,457
Fool proof.

107
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:24,252
Or you want your family
eatin' beans out in the street?

108
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,599
One day I'm gonna buy you
a Cadillac for each foot, Mama.

109
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:41,520
And you're gonna skate
around town lookin' so bad.

110
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:45,899
Just take care of the kids, Dexter.

111
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,279
You the man of the house now.

112
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,450
I'm tryin', Mama.

113
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,036
I'm tryin'.

114
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,205
(coughs)

115
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,810
You didn't lick this, did you?

116
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,772
No, ma'am.

117
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,108
Stand up.

118
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,163
I hope this fits. I worked all day.

119
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,001
Turn around. Stand still.

120
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,049
- Do you love your mother?
- Yes, ma'am.

121
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,594
"Yes, ma'am" what?

122
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,138
Yes, ma'am, I love you, Mother.

123
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,685
Good girl.

124
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,154
Where's your fork?

125
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,199
- Fork?
- I gave you a fork with this.

126
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,078
Where is your fork?

127
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,124
Well, it must have fallen... somewhere.

128
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,209
- On the floor, maybe.
- You don't know?

129
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,379
No, I'm sure it's on the floor.
I mean, I know I dropped it.

130
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:34,883
You know the punishment
for losing silverware.

131
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,344
I'm sure it's right here.

132
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,931
I knew it was there.

133
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,776
Some niggers robbed the store.

134
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,780
Again? May they burn in hell.

135
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,325
I'm very tense from this.

136
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:05,330
- You have one of your headaches?
- Ooh.

137
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,957
I'm very, very tense about this.

138
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,461
Alice has been bad.

139
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,882
She's been feeding that thing
between the walls again.

140
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,134
- No...
- (wailing)

141
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,553
Remember not to bruise her face.

142
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:30,980
Bad girls... burn in hell.

143
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,068
(Leroy) There.

144
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:39,656
- (man) Jesus. It goes on for ever.
- No bars on the windows.

145
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:43,201
No car in the driveway.
Maybe we lucked out. Where's Fool?

146
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,912
He's goin' in. Takin' it cool.

147
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,673
May I help you?

148
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,554
Good afternoon, ma'am. I'd like to show
you some of these cookies we're selling.

149
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,683
I'm sorry. We watch what we eat
very carefully here.

150
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,813
I know it's a bother,
but so is... cerebral palsy.

151
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,107
- And if we don't do all we can...
- I'm sorry.

152
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,944
Well, do you have, like,
a bathroom I could use?

153
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,697
They leave us out here all day
without anywhere to take a leak.

154
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,492
- Sorry. Run along.
- That's all right.

155
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,911
No. Run along.

156
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,122
That's OK.

157
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,383
Heavy wire screens on the back windows.

158
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:08,388
- They been hit before, you think?
- No, probably just the neighborhood.

159
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,724
- How are the screens held on?
- Padlocks on the outside.

160
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,144
Padlocks on the outside?
Jeez. What else?

161
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:19,566
- Any alarms?
- I don't know. She wouldn't let me in.

162
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,778
- I told you to tell her you gotta piss.
- She wasn't buyin' that.

163
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,742
- I wanna take a look.
- Don't be stupid, Spenser.

164
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,036
The kid told us all there was to see.

165
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:36,207
- We go in Sunday as planned.
- What if they got an alarm to the police?

166
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,669
I'm not going in Sunday
without checking out the security.

167
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:43,339
Just look at the doors... the basement,
maybe the connector boxes.

168
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:48,261
How the hell are you gonna get in? She
wouldn't even let him up on the porch.

169
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:52,557
You send a boy to do a man's job,
that's what you get.

170
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:57,478
Anyway, if you thought the Bear Scout
disguise was good, watch this.

171
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,831
- Help you?
- Gas company, ma'am.

172
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:21,878
Got an emergency. Got an emergency.
I need to check your meter.

173
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,172
You passed it on your way up the drive.

174
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:28,593
Oh, that one we've already got. There's
one inside the house I need to check.

175
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,429
There's none in the house.
I'm quite sure of that.

176
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:35,183
You're probably not even aware of it,
ma'am, but it's on the list.

177
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,686
We got a leak on the block,
and it could be very dangerous.

178
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,230
Identification?

179
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:46,945
We do have a legal right to come in,
even if we do have to call the police.

180
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,113
Not that we ever have.

181
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,665
It's just there have been
a lot of robberies lately.

182
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,751
The neighbourhood's changing.
It has us all a bit on edge.

183
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,962
I completely understand.

184
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:08,508
Better this little bother than
a chance of danger, though, right?

185
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,933
(Fool) I don't know how he got past
that woman. She's got x-ray eyeballs.

186
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,061
(Leroy) Spenser's as slippery
as a snake.

187
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:23,022
- I think he's up to somethin'.
- Somethin' like what?

188
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,693
Like grabbin' that coin collection
for himself and cuttin' me out.

189
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,863
Cuttin' us out. Spenser mess with you,
he gotta deal with me, too.

190
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,368
You somethin', Fool.

191
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,880
- She leave him alone? You're kiddin'.
- There has to be someone else in there.

192
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,882
Old folks, kids or something.

193
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,970
Maybe Spenser should stick
his ugly head out and give us a signal.

194
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,390
Maybe he lookin' around a little bit,
to make sure it's safe.

195
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,644
Maybe the president is gonna
make me Secretary of Pussy.

196
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,398
Now, he's probably in there
hiding the best for himself.

197
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,526
Come on. We're goin' in.

198
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,029
Spenser said we gotta
stay out here, Leroy.

199
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,364
So he can get
all the good shit for himself?

200
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:18,036
Why not throw your mom out in
the street along with Ruby and the kids?

201
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,111
See?

202
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,099
(grunts) They in Fort Knox or what?

203
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:25,394
Listen, Leroy. This breakin'
and enterin' might not be so smart.

204
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,649
I mean, it's the first day
of my 13th birthday.

205
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:34,445
- Could be unlucky.
- 13th birthday is unlucky anyway.

206
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:39,408
Too old to get tit, too young to get ass.
You're fucked either way.

207
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,208
Lord, now look at this.

208
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,007
The mother of all doors.

209
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,553
They ain't messin' around.

210
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,682
Spenser.

211
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,726
Spenser!

212
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,981
(squeaking)

213
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,777
Uh, so, Leroy,...

214
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:18,531
..you think I got what it takes
to be a doctor?

215
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,825
Doctor of burglary, maybe.

216
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,578
You're lucky
I'm teachin' you a trade, kid.

217
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,956
Ain't no door stands up to Leroy.

218
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,382
I done busted this house's cherry.

219
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,634
It's opened right up now.

220
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,600
Get off him!

221
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,061
Leroy!

222
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:54,358
Hey, fuzzball!
Your mother sleeps with cats!

223
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,367
Run, Fool!

224
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,664
That's one mean motherfucker.
You see that?

225
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,335
- He came at me like an airplane.
- I saw him all right.

226
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,678
He gone?

227
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,847
He's waitin' right there.

228
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,391
Been trained to wait there, probably.

229
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,603
He'll stay out there,
and we stay right in here.

230
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,817
(fly buzzing)

231
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,406
This place is weird.

232
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,576
"See no evil,
hear no evil, speak no evil."

233
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,120
Every cabinet has a lock on it.

234
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,292
Why do you think they do that?

235
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,755
Somebody need a bath, bad.

236
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,590
(banging)

237
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,724
Nice to see the rich folks got rats too.

238
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:13,062
Listen, Leroy, let's just
get outta here. Out the front.

239
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,982
First we find out what's up
with good old Spenser.

240
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,651
Man, the hell with Spenser.
Let's get outta here.

241
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,654
The hell with those gold coins too, huh?

242
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,033
Maybe you're too stupid for this
kinda work, or maybe too chickenshit.

243
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,160
(scurrying)

244
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,207
Oh, there's that bastard now.

245
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,793
He's upstairs.

246
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,421
We'll surprise him. Come on.

247
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,972
- You comin' or what?
- I'm comin'.

248
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,028
(click)

249
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,950
(clock chimes)

250
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,334
I don't think
we should go up there, Leroy.

251
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,627
Oh, that's fine, girlfriend.

252
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:22,465
I tell you what. You stay down here,
and you keep an eye out.

253
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,217
You think you can do that?
(blows a kiss)

254
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,765
Yeah, I can do that.

255
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:43,486
Man, there's enough room
for ten families in here.

256
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,364
(Leroy) Spenser!
Spenser, are you up here?

257
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,204
(clanking)

258
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,286
(scrabbling)

259
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,469
Spenser!

260
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,997
Spenser, you back in there?

261
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,999
(eerie whispering)

262
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,376
I ain't stupid.

263
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:31,844
"Or maybe you're just
too chickenshit for this kinda work."

264
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,701
- ( door locks)
- (eerie voice) Fool.

265
00:25:01,249 --> 00:26:05,938
Spenser?

266
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:10,276
(man) How can you say that of me?
I've never been unfaithful to you.

267
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,904
(woman) I'm not talking
about another woman, John.

268
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,491
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Connect the dots, John.

269
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:21,912
Everyone else has. Ever since Paris.
Ever since Cybill killed herseIf.

270
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:25,082
(man) Cybill's death
was a sailing accident.

271
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,378
- That's what I am - a survivor.
- Tiffany!

272
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:35,843
I'm sorry, John. Sorry for the both of us.
Sorry for the child that... we never had.

273
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:39,054
- And never will!
- Tiffany, don't get...

274
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,223
(gunfire)

275
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,520
Now the anti-aircraft battery!
They're firing.

276
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,981
- Where?
- I think it's the barracks.

277
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,984
They're over by the barracks.

278
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,404
We can hear the staccato firing,
and now here it comes.

279
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,031
Baghdad is lighting up!

280
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:02,328
Tracers flaring up like... like
angry hornets from every rooftop now.

281
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:06,915
We cannot see the bombers, but the fire
of their munitions is shaking the city.

282
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:10,628
It's shaking our hotel. Oh, look! See it?

283
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,922
There! Right over there,
flying just over the rooftops.

284
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,050
Spenser, you back in there?

285
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,218
(bang)

286
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,101
(eerie voice) No!

287
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,699
(groaning)

288
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,705
Spenser!

289
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,167
(groaning)

290
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,451
You can't do that,
you miserable stinkin' thing!

291
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,954
(gibbering)

292
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,290
Come on, Spense.
I'm gonna get you outta here.

293
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:44,847
Man... this ain't right.

294
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,819
Who are you?

295
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,336
Leroy, we gotta get outta this place!

296
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,302
(gibbering)

297
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,433
(groaning)

298
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,397
Hello? Miss?

299
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,177
Leroy. Leroy!

300
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,357
Leroy?

301
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,288
- Leroy?
- Jesus!

302
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:17,875
- You scared the shit outta me.
- I thought you were dead!

303
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,586
- You was just layin' there.
- A man ain't dead...

304
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,880
..just cos he's layin' on the floor.

305
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,424
I was listenin'. Something's in there.

306
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:30,220
As a matter of fact, why don't you
crawl in there and see what it is?

307
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:33,849
Turkey-brain! Are you hittin' on me
like I'm here to save yourass?

308
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:37,352
You're gonna stick your dumb head
in there and lose it, like Spenser!

309
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:41,189
- What kinda shit you talkin'?
- I'm talkin' we gotta get outta here.

310
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,860
The x-ray lady's back.
She's out back right now by the van.

311
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,029
She got a man with her
the size of Detroit!

312
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,197
Damn. You seen Spenser?

313
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:52,242
- I seen Spenser all right.
- He find anything?

314
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,412
Somethin' found him. He's dead, Leroy.

315
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,749
I think scared to death.

316
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,711
- You sure?
- You thought he was white before?

317
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,297
You should see that sucker now!

318
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,561
There is somebody in there.
The door's been pried.

319
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,397
- I told you there'd be another one.
- Out the front.

320
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,277
Wah!

321
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,322
Oh, shit!

322
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,824
Oh, my hand!

323
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:39,206
(woman) Pry it open at the bottom,
enough so Prince can get in.

324
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,375
(snarling)

325
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:50,550
- Come on, Fool!
- Agh! What are you doin'?

326
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,762
Stay here in the open
so the fuckin' dog can see you.

327
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:57,099
You think I'm crazy? He's got teeth
he ain't even used yet!

328
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,310
Do like I say,
or I'm gonna take your head off.

329
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,983
I'm gonna nail that sucker, don't worry.

330
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,735
- I'm worryin'.
- (barking)

331
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,070
(man) Kill him!

332
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,746
Uh-oh.

333
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,751
- Where'd he go?
- (growIs)

334
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,170
Shit!

335
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,683
- Leroy!
- What the hell are you doin', Fool?!

336
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,601
Come on!

337
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:55,365
I'm gonna take your fuckin' head off!

338
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:06,043
(woman) I heard him yell!
I heard him go down!

339
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,634
- I told you, don't mess with me.
- Man, I saved your body.

340
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,262
- Are these people crazy or what?
- You ask 'em!

341
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,098
Get in there, Daddy!
Get in there and get 'em!

342
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,975
Make it safe for Mommy!

343
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,418
Ow! Damn!

344
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,385
Little doggy baby! Someone is in here.

345
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,764
The people under the stairs
got the so-called gasman.

346
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:05,477
- The other one must be upstairs.
- Princey... Daddy'll get him.

347
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:11,233
That's a big-calibre automatic.
Did you ever see the holes they tear?

348
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,612
- We can hide under the bed.
- I ain't goin' in there, man.

349
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,573
No room. Find your own.

350
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,787
- (banging)
- (locks clicking)

351
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,663
Aha!

352
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,712
Run, Fool!

353
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,305
Fool... Yee-ha!

354
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,766
Got him! (laughs)

355
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,687
Oh, Daddy!

356
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,734
- See that? He came at me like a bull.
- Just like a bull!

357
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,361
A big one!

358
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:41,156
- Did you hear what he called me?
- He called you a fool.

359
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,158
(man) He's the fool!

360
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,911
(woman) The only good fool's
a dead one.

361
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:56,254
- (woman) Upstairs might be a mess.
- I don't want a mess. I better go look.

362
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,798
We might have to mop up a little.

363
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,691
Thought I heard something. Stay there.

364
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,286
Get back in the cellar, you little bastard.

365
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:21,840
(echoing) You little animal shit!
I get the dog up here, you'll be sorry.

366
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,236
(creaking)

367
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,382
My... my name is Fool.

368
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,219
- What's yours?
- Alice.

369
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:13,683
Don't be scared. You...
you never seen a brother before?

370
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:16,770
- I never had a brother.
- No, I mean a black dude.

371
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,689
There's black folks
in this neighbourhood.

372
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,983
Neighbourhood?

373
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,362
The neighbourhood.

374
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,739
You know, outside?

375
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,326
Well, that's outside, not in here.

376
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,870
So you get outside, don't you?

377
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:40,502
- Are... are you sayin' never?
- Can't get out. No one ever has.

378
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,130
Well... well, I'm gonna get out.

379
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,758
I'm a whole other thing.

380
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,971
People have tried.

381
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:56,559
You... you mean
the... the people in the cellar?

382
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:06,069
Who are they?

383
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:11,241
Mommy and Daddy looked a long time
to find the perfect boy child.

384
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,120
But each one they found turned out bad.

385
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,705
Some saw things
they weren't supposed to.

386
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,834
Others heard too much,
others talked back.

387
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:27,340
Daddy cut out the bad parts
and put the boys in the cellar...

388
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,509
...one by one.

389
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:32,637
When they get flashlights
and food of some kind...

390
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,306
...they're happy in their own way.

391
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,685
Yeah, right.

392
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,981
(bolts door)

393
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,984
What about you?

394
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:49,571
How come they haven't
put you in the cellar?

395
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:55,994
I do not see, or hear, or speak evil.

396
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,252
It's the only way.

397
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,882
( agonised yelling)

398
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,720
- What is that?
- What?

399
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,890
- That yellin'. What is that?
- Well, that's Roach.

400
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,058
- Roach?
- That's who Daddy's hunting.

401
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:24,147
See, Daddy hates Roach cos he got
out of the cellar and into the walls.

402
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,648
And Daddy can't find him.

403
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,817
(Roach yelling)

404
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:46,961
- There must be another way out.
- Further into the house. Here.

405
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:50,215
Father's too big to follow,
and he's afraid of what's in there.

406
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:54,093
- I don't want in, I want out.
- Sometimes in is out.

407
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,015
(Roach yells)

408
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,644
Forget it.

409
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,771
(Roach laughs)

410
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,780
(man) I hear ya! I hear ya!

411
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,199
(gunshot)

412
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,245
Yes.

413
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,039
- OK, I'll get in there.
- (gunshot)

414
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:30,922
(gunshot)

415
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,935
(taunting laughter)

416
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,943
(man) I'm gonna get ya!

417
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:53,987
- (gunshot)
- Yes!

418
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,155
(laughter)

419
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,663
I've got something for my Princey. Yes!

420
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,249
Come on. Come on. Come on.

421
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,460
Good appetite.

422
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:13,464
Healthy Prince... a secure home.

423
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,802
(tyres squeal)

424
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,388
Stay.

425
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:27,186
(radio) The vehicle registration matches
that of a van used in a 21 1 last night.

426
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:38,615
Daddy. Police out back.

427
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,537
Damn.

428
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:52,962
(growIs)

429
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,098
Hey, police! Police!

430
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,147
Police! Police!

431
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:15,360
Hello. What can I do for you, gentlemen?

432
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,071
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Is this your van?

433
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:22,408
Goodness, no. It was just standing here
when we got back from shopping.

434
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:25,703
- Did you see anybody around?
- Trouble?

435
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,956
Well, as a matter of fact
we did see a couple of men -

436
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,084
one black, one white -

437
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,419
walking away as we approached.

438
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,172
We thought they were
service people of some sort.

439
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:39,300
- They were working on your door.
- No harm done.

440
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,844
- We'll check the house.
- Just checked it.

441
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,972
Even looked under the beds.
Clean as a whistle.

442
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,475
Well, let's recon the neighbourhood.

443
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:51,104
- Do you get a lot of this?
- It's as if we're the prisoners,...

444
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,065
- ..and the criminals roam free.
- I know what you mean.

445
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:58,361
You're lucky. This van was used
in a liquor-store robbery last night.

446
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:01,406
- Oh, goodness.
- Liquor store?

447
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:05,243
I'd advise you to stay inside,
keep your doors locked for a while.

448
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,870
You can count on it.

449
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:15,211
Hope you catch 'em.

450
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:19,549
- Catch 'em in hell.
- Oh, my God.

451
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:23,928
- What?
- There's not just the two.

452
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:30,309
There's a boy.

453
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,937
He's in there right now...

454
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,441
..with our little angel!

455
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,031
(snarls)

456
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,266
God! What are they feedin' you?

457
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:29,368
(man) What is it, boy?

458
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,512
(man groans)

459
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,851
You come in here
and I'm gonna kick your ass!

460
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,500
Gonna kill you!

461
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,384
Kill.

462
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,096
Kill them!

463
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,398
(boy grunts)

464
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,987
(grunts)

465
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,580
Is this your place?

466
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,047
(snarls)

467
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:09,844
- What hit you?
- The damn Bear Trooper.

468
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:13,890
But Prince is after him.
He'll kill him before he gets to Alice.

469
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,901
Let's do somethin'!

470
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,243
(laughs hysterically)

471
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,537
(howling)

472
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:39,540
Do you hear something?

473
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:52,094
The boy's gotten to Alice.

474
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,282
Thanks.

475
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:19,622
He doesn't talk much, does he?

476
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:22,458
His... his tongue's cut out.

477
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,005
(whispers) Oh, man!

478
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:31,884
Mummy caught him trying to
call for help one day, and...

479
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:35,680
- ...Daddy had to teach him...
- Speak no evil, right?

480
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:40,768
Your father's one sick mother,
you know that?

481
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:44,188
Actually, your mother's
one sick mother, too.

482
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,107
Sh!

483
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:51,112
You're speaking evil. They'd kill you
if they heard a word you just said.

484
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,867
Roach. Roach is my friend.

485
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,036
Roach?

486
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:03,874
I'm Poindexter. Everybody calls me Fool.

487
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,377
Fool?

488
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:10,381
We sure got the names, huh?

489
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,433
Is this Leroy?

490
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:27,857
You did this? Why do you make these?

491
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:32,445
To hold the souls
of burglars when they died.

492
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:36,699
Or salesmen, workmen...
other people who saw too much.

493
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,964
There she is!

494
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:57,261
You viper in my bosom!

495
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,681
- You little Judas!
- What do I do with him, Mommy?

496
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:03,601
It is time to clean house!

497
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:10,649
Total spring-cleaning.

498
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:15,279
OK, let's move it!
Pull, you little piece of shit!

499
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:19,575
No, wait a minute!

500
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:38,677
I am sick and tired of your attitude!
You will do your chore now!

501
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,766
Clean it up, for God's sake!

502
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,977
What is a mother to do?

503
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:51,357
Lazy brat sits in her room
all day, sewing dolls!

504
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:55,361
Children misbehaving in the basement!

505
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,489
And one in the walls...

506
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:01,826
..doing his business God knows where!

507
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,621
You kids'll be the death of me!

508
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,126
The death of me.

509
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:41,782
I keep 'em real hungry.

510
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:47,413
I ask a simple thing -

511
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:53,169
just clean up that awful man's blood -
and what do you do?

512
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:58,090
You get it all over your nice,
clean dress I worked so hard to make!

513
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:01,093
Now get in that tub and scrub yourself!

514
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:03,262
No!

515
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:06,140
Don't wanna get in, huh?
Well, let me help you!

516
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,684
(screams)

517
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,353
You scrub yourself!

518
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,357
You scrub yourself! It's hot!

519
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:17,902
The fires of hell are hotter!

520
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,589
No! Don't put me in there!

521
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,966
No! No!

522
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,476
No!

523
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:57,608
Where's the Bear Trooper?

524
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,530
Dead meat.

525
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:09,536
I could've killed him, but I let
the people under the stairs do it.

526
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:31,767
Leave me alone!

527
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:36,105
Get away from me!

528
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,838
Roach.

529
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:05,801
It's right there, Roach.

530
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,558
(man) I told you to keep quiet
down there!

531
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:13,684
You're drivin' me nuts!

532
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:14,977
Pull it!

533
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:19,857
Guard 'em, Prince. Guard 'em.

534
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,362
Noisy bastards.

535
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:30,117
If I have to come down there,
you're gonna be sorry.

536
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:37,416
Roach, you're shot.
We gotta get you to a hospital.

537
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,370
The coin collection.

538
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,705
Leroy was right.

539
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,671
Thanks, Roach.

540
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:50,030
Alice is up there?

541
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,919
Roach!

542
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,798
Roach...

543
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,925
(barking and snarling)

544
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:28,652
Get outta here! Go!

545
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:48,380
(man) What did he do to you?
I told you never to talk to anybody!

546
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:52,718
You hear me? Come here!
You answer me!

547
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:55,053
Did you tell him anything?

548
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,640
If you did, you know what I'll do.

549
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:03,604
I killed your skinny friend in the walls.
Now what do you think of that?

550
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:09,735
Oh, I got him good.
And the black one, too.

551
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:11,904
(barking)

552
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,617
Shut the fuck up!

553
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:23,373
What the hell's wrong with him?

554
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,671
- He said he killed you.
- He exaggerated.

555
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:39,181
Come on!

556
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:41,141
Stay!

557
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,904
Move. If he finds us,
he'll shoot through the walls.

558
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:57,115
- My dress is stuck on something.
- Oh, great(!)

559
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:04,748
Uh-oh. You gotta keep goin', Alice.
Come on.

560
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:13,715
Burn in hell for gettin' free,
and burn in hell for showin' the way!

561
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,314
Who turned on the heat?

562
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:37,698
Burn! Burn!

563
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:40,033
Burn in hell!

564
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,038
Burn!

565
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,713
(coughing)

566
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:57,342
Alice, he's comin' closer.
We gotta get outta here.

567
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:31,126
- Which way?
- Only Roach knew the way.

568
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:33,128
So we'll explore.

569
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:35,589
(cocks gun) Gonna find you!

570
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:38,133
- I gotta sneeze.
- Gonna kill ya!

571
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,013
(sneezes)

572
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:50,270
Sh! If he can't hear us, he can't shoot us.

573
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:07,663
- We gotta be careful.
- Real careful.

574
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:11,917
- Do you think you got him?
- We'll soon find out. Come on.

575
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:14,461
Come on. Kill. Kill. Kill.

576
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:17,547
Kill! Kill 'em, Prince. Kill 'em!

577
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,091
Kill 'em!

578
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:22,594
Sh! I just heard something.

579
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,848
Come on!

580
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:33,605
I'm not runnin' any more.

581
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:36,191
Come on!

582
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,986
(screaming)

583
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:45,117
Alice!

584
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:00,215
Alice, get back!

585
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:20,026
(Alice) Get away from the wall!
Get away from the wall!

586
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,179
Got ya.

587
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:50,807
Got ya!

588
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,360
Jesus.

589
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:05,071
I got him! I got him!

590
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:11,453
I got him, I got him, I got him!
I got him, I got him!

591
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:14,331
I got him, I got him, I got him!

592
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,666
Prove it.

593
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,006
Hey! Hey, wait a minute.

594
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:26,051
There's light up there. Come on.

595
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:40,398
I know you're in there,
you little piece of shit.

596
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,484
- (growls)
- Oh, no!

597
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:50,200
Oh, shit.

598
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:52,619
You killed Prince!

599
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:17,727
Look. You can see
the lights of the ghetto from here.

600
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,939
I never thought
smog could smell so good.

601
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,401
- Help!
- Sh!

602
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:27,904
- We might have to climb down.
- There's nothing to hold on to.

603
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,198
It's just a straight drop off the roof.

604
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:32,158
- Wait a minute.
- What?

605
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:36,246
The water in the garden.
I think it's right under this window.

606
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:39,207
If we take a jump off the edge,
we might be able to hit it.

607
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:42,168
- I don't know how deep it is.
- (banging) I hear 'em!

608
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:45,797
- Alice, come on. We gotta jump!
- I can't! I'm afraid.

609
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:47,966
You upstairs, Alice?

610
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:50,010
- Alice!
- What's out there?

611
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:54,055
There he is!

612
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:02,105
What were you doin' with him?
Come here.

613
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:04,399
Alice! Alice!

614
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:13,408
No! No! No! No!

615
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:22,083
Damn it.

616
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:39,809
I'll be back, Alice! Hang on!

617
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:43,939
Bastard!

618
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:47,984
Never shoot your gun outside!

619
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:52,447
- He got away.
- Come back inside.

620
01:05:57,745 --> 01:05:59,788
Damn it.

621
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:03,625
Bad boy! Go on.

622
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:09,756
Go to your room and get into your suit.

623
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:17,263
If these had come from anybody else,
I'd make you take 'em straight back.

624
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,849
- You know that?
- Yes, sir.

625
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:25,021
Well, figurin' the rarity of these,...

626
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:28,775
..you do have enough
to pay your rent for a while.

627
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:31,444
Say, to the year 2000.

628
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:37,283
- And Mama's operation?
- And your mama's operation.

629
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:42,163
Keep hold of these till tomorrow.

630
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:45,125
I'm gonna order
an ambulance for your mama.

631
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:48,128
Tomorrow we'll take those to
a good coin dealer,

632
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:50,380
and we'll all be smilin'.

633
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:52,966
Meanwhile, you be careful.

634
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:57,137
That brother-sister act you messed with
are evil, plain and simple.

635
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,889
Wait a minute. Brother and sister?

636
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:05,353
Brother and sister. Tail end of
the craziest family you ever heard of.

637
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:08,606
Every generation more insane
than the one before.

638
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:12,235
Started out as a family
runnin' a funeral home,...

639
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:16,740
...sellin' cheap coffins
for expensive prices.

640
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:19,743
Then they got their fingers
into real estate,...

641
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:23,079
..started makin' a lot of money
takin' over people's homes.

642
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:26,041
The more money they got,
the greedier they got.

643
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:29,210
The greedier they got,
the crazier they got.

644
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:33,048
All sorts of rumours about
what's gone on in that place.

645
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:37,802
Never proved it because
the police didn't take it serious.

646
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:42,640
But believe me, when I was a kid,
none of us ever walked past that house.

647
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,942
You OK, Fool?

648
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:57,322
I was just tellin' Mama that
I did somethin' wrong. Real wrong.

649
01:07:57,448 --> 01:08:00,033
And now I gotta do somethin' right.

650
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,702
I done the tarot cards on you again.

651
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:07,207
They come up real scary. Don't go
messin' with them people again.

652
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:14,672
Somebody has to.
And maybe that means me.

653
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:19,844
Anyway, I made a promise to Alice.
And I'm gonna keep it.

654
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:53,253
- 14th Precinct.
- Hello. Police?

655
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:54,420
Yes.

656
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:56,714
I'd like to report a case of child abuse.

657
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:59,926
- All right. When did this happen?
- Right now.

658
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:06,850
- Is this real or what?
- Bogus. The place is clean.

659
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:11,020
The people don't even have kids.
They have coffee, though.

660
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:14,607
(cop) I'm gonna go upstairs
and look around.

661
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:19,279
- More coffee?
- No, thank you. I've had plenty.

662
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:32,625
I'm so sorry you all had to come out
at such an hour for such a silly thing.

663
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:41,759
But, you know, it's better
there are a few false calls...

664
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:45,555
...if we can prevent
just one child from being abused.

665
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:48,892
- Mm-hm. Absolutely right.
- Cream and sugar?

666
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:21,507
Nice furniture. You didn't get that stuff
at Price Club, that's for sure.

667
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:24,135
- It's been in the family for years.
- Yeah?

668
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:28,723
Used to be the house
was used for, uh... business.

669
01:10:28,849 --> 01:10:30,808
- No kidding?
- Sergeant?

670
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:33,019
There's something you might wanna see.

671
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:35,521
- What?
- Take a look.

672
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:49,786
- I thought you said you had no kids.
- Alice left us a long time ago.

673
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:52,705
The Lord saw fit to come and take her.

674
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:55,375
Never touched the room since.

675
01:10:55,501 --> 01:11:00,964
We're foolish, I suppose, but...
in a sense, she still lives here.

676
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:07,887
- And always will.
- My apologies.

677
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:10,139
It must be very painful for you.

678
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:13,685
I'm sorry about this.
This should have never happened.

679
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:16,521
No need to apologise.
We wanna be helpful.

680
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:20,858
- (woman) Good night, sir.
- (cop) Thanks for the refreshments.

681
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:22,568
You're welcome.

682
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:27,573
I don't wanna see
another cop or cookie in my life!

683
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:31,494
I don't know which one makes me sicker.

684
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,955
May they burn in hell.

685
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:38,126
For ever and ever in hell.

686
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:56,144
- The shelf worked.
- Yup.

687
01:11:57,229 --> 01:12:00,398
Always does. Simple works best.

688
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:04,652
Gotta get a new dog tomorrow.

689
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:06,988
A good big one.

690
01:12:14,621 --> 01:12:18,583
(woman) I was worried. The police left
the back door open for so long.

691
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:21,085
- So?
- I couldn't watch it all the time.

692
01:12:21,211 --> 01:12:25,214
- Think any of 'em got out?
- Nah. They were pretty out of it.

693
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,842
- What'd you use?
- Horse tranquillisers.

694
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:38,704
(man) Tomorrow I'm gonna look
for the Bear Trooper.

695
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:41,416
- Where would you look?
- The ghetto.

696
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:44,252
I'll find him. And I'll kill him.

697
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:50,258
- Night, Mama.
- Night, Daddy.

698
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:54,846
- Say your prayers like a good boy.
- Oh! I forgot.

699
01:13:55,931 --> 01:13:58,641
(woman) Now I lay me down to sleep...

700
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:02,311
(man) Now I lay me down to sleep...

701
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:06,232
(both) ...I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

702
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:10,820
If I should kill before I wake...

703
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:14,740
(woman) ...I pray the Lord
my soul to take.

704
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:17,785
(man) ...I pray the Lord my soul to take.

705
01:14:29,506 --> 01:14:32,383
Ah! You miserable little shit!

706
01:14:35,762 --> 01:14:37,346
Shut up!

707
01:14:41,935 --> 01:14:44,270
You hurt my baby!

708
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:49,108
Get him! Get him!

709
01:15:00,787 --> 01:15:03,247
- Get him! Get him!
- (yells)

710
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,918
"Downstairs door."

711
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:31,776
- Did you get him?
- He's fast, damn it!

712
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:33,778
Open the kitchen.

713
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:41,994
Oh, shit!

714
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,872
What happened? Did he get out?

715
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:48,042
Oh! Burn in hell.

716
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:51,045
(man) Burn in hell.

717
01:15:51,171 --> 01:15:54,966
(woman) What about Alice?
What'll we do with her?

718
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:57,677
Let her hang up there all night.

719
01:15:57,803 --> 01:16:02,765
- (woman) She's terrified of the attic.
- I know. It serves her right.

720
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,752
- Alice!
- Fool?

721
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,964
Are you OK?

722
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:38,676
Can you get any more of these bricks out?

723
01:16:38,802 --> 01:16:41,429
- I can't. They've got me stuck.
- How?

724
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:44,974
I'm tied to a bolt in the chimney.

725
01:16:46,643 --> 01:16:47,643
This one?

726
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:50,021
(banging)

727
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:57,111
Yes.

728
01:16:57,237 --> 01:16:58,988
- Hi.
- Hi.

729
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:05,828
Let's see if we can get
some more of these bricks out.

730
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:10,625
Sh! Get down!

731
01:17:26,266 --> 01:17:28,684
Let me down, please.

732
01:17:34,024 --> 01:17:38,152
Daddy! Come down from there
and help me to bed!

733
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:41,113
Daddy!

734
01:17:50,123 --> 01:17:52,375
I said now!

735
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,838
He's gone. Fool?

736
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:00,841
Fool?

737
01:18:03,136 --> 01:18:05,179
Meet me at the window.
You know the one.

738
01:18:05,305 --> 01:18:06,972
OK.

739
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:10,059
- You find him, bring him back to me.
- I will!

740
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:13,562
I'll take him under the stairs
and do him like the others.

741
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:16,774
- Only it won't be his ears I cut off.
- His balls!

742
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,195
Here, hold this.

743
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:33,040
Listen, Alice. They're not your real parents.

744
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:35,418
They're not even husband and wife.

745
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:39,922
They stole you, like they did
Roach and all the others.

746
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:42,717
They're a bunch of
rotten baby snatchers.

747
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:46,679
- You're just saying that.
- My grandfather Booker told me.

748
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:49,223
He wouldn't lie to me.

749
01:18:52,102 --> 01:18:54,353
What do we do now?

750
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,690
Feel up to a little jump?

751
01:18:57,816 --> 01:19:01,152
The problem is, first thing he did
when you escaped was drain it...

752
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:04,113
..and put broken glass and rocks
in the bottom.

753
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:05,698
That's a problem.

754
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:08,909
The way we came up before
he's got fixed now.

755
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:17,543
Look.

756
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:22,173
- (Fool) This place is one big bomb.
- (Alice) He's got 'em all over the house.

757
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:26,469
- Think you could climb the roof?
- What's up there?

758
01:19:29,806 --> 01:19:31,432
The only way out.

759
01:19:38,982 --> 01:19:42,902
- How dare he come into our home?
- He came back to get Alice!

760
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:47,072
- You should have let me kill her.
- You stay away from Alice!

761
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,242
- She did it with him, I know it.
- Not my little girl!

762
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:52,578
She's a whore!

763
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,003
(clattering)

764
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:06,300
What is that?

765
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,815
(Fool) Oh, God!

766
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:24,026
- That hurts so bad!
- (laughs)

767
01:20:28,406 --> 01:20:30,658
See him?

768
01:20:31,451 --> 01:20:33,828
I can't see shit!

769
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:36,914
Let me see the brick.

770
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,291
Hold it. I think I hear somethin'.

771
01:20:40,126 --> 01:20:41,210
Bombs away.

772
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:42,962
- (rattling)
- No!

773
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:45,381
- (thud)
- Argh!

774
01:20:46,758 --> 01:20:48,968
I guess it was one of those smart bricks.

775
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:51,011
You bastard!

776
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:54,640
Come on. You can do it.
Just brace yourself on the sides.

777
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:03,190
This is it. Hang on.

778
01:21:06,736 --> 01:21:08,571
(screams)

779
01:21:10,657 --> 01:21:12,449
The gun!

780
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,511
Ca-ca!

781
01:21:35,515 --> 01:21:38,392
- Hold it. Do you know where we are?
- Uh-uh.

782
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:41,645
There's the living room.
Get out the back door.

783
01:21:41,771 --> 01:21:45,482
- Fool, come with me.
- I'm not finished with them yet.

784
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,446
- Fool...
- Go!

785
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:53,824
I'm gonna get the shotgun,
set those kids free.

786
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:18,682
(man) I... I will get them.

787
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:25,356
(boys gibbering)

788
01:22:39,412 --> 01:22:41,246
Sh!

789
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:48,587
Hold it right there!

790
01:22:49,714 --> 01:22:52,675
Where is that little bastard? Tell me!

791
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:55,719
- Tell me!
- I... I won't tell you.

792
01:22:56,429 --> 01:22:58,847
We will get him out of our house!

793
01:22:59,849 --> 01:23:04,103
He's filthy! He's bad. He's awful!

794
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:11,443
Go to hell!

795
01:23:16,282 --> 01:23:17,574
(woman) Eldon!

796
01:23:18,618 --> 01:23:22,871
Oh, God! He's turned
my little girl against me!

797
01:23:24,874 --> 01:23:27,292
I told you. Those two...

798
01:23:28,461 --> 01:23:30,796
Then she can burn in hell.

799
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:34,466
Both of them.

800
01:23:43,059 --> 01:23:46,145
She doesn't have a key. She's still in here!

801
01:23:58,908 --> 01:24:01,535
(gibbering)

802
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,833
- (glass shattering)
- (banging)

803
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:10,794
- She's in the cellar.
- No way.

804
01:24:11,671 --> 01:24:13,922
Then he is.

805
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:20,220
You know a prayer?

806
01:24:20,346 --> 01:24:22,347
You say it.

807
01:24:33,443 --> 01:24:35,861
Shoot her if you see her.

808
01:24:44,996 --> 01:24:47,414
Come here!

809
01:24:55,632 --> 01:24:57,800
See your friends?

810
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:04,223
- Get him?
- Oh, yeah.

811
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:07,518
(knocking)

812
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:13,023
Sh! It may be the police again. Hold on.

813
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:39,007
My name is Ruby. I represent the
Association of People Unjustly Evicted,...

814
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:41,927
- ...Exploited and Generally Fucked Over.
- What?

815
01:25:42,428 --> 01:25:45,472
You and your brother are
landlords of over 50 buildings...

816
01:25:45,598 --> 01:25:48,475
...which you allow
to deteriorate into hellholes...

817
01:25:48,601 --> 01:25:51,436
..while you guys get rich
charging ridiculous rents!

818
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:57,109
Then you evict anyone when they can't
pay so you can tear down their homes.

819
01:25:57,235 --> 01:26:00,362
- Ain't that about right?
- None of your goddamn business!

820
01:26:04,617 --> 01:26:06,910
Kill the little bugger!

821
01:26:07,453 --> 01:26:09,955
Kiss your ass goodbye, boy.

822
01:26:10,081 --> 01:26:11,665
(gibbering)

823
01:26:20,633 --> 01:26:24,428
- What the hell is going on?!
- He's loose again! Damn it!

824
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:28,432
- (knocking)
- (man) Police! Open up!

825
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:30,100
Sh!

826
01:26:33,646 --> 01:26:36,273
Police! We have reports of gunfire!

827
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:40,861
If you do not open this door,
we'll break it down!

828
01:26:45,825 --> 01:26:49,536
- Get off my property!
- Just want to finish sayin' our piece.

829
01:26:49,662 --> 01:26:53,165
Not only are you bad landlords
but, ten times worse,...

830
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:57,878
..you've stolen children from
our community for your own sick needs.

831
01:26:58,004 --> 01:27:00,589
There's no community here.

832
01:27:01,674 --> 01:27:03,842
All I see are a couple of n...

833
01:27:03,968 --> 01:27:06,386
(man) Ruby! We're right here.

834
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:11,600
(woman) We busted your ass, bitch!

835
01:27:13,102 --> 01:27:15,687
What are you gonna do? Shoot us all?

836
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:18,607
- You'll do!
- (Alice) No!

837
01:27:22,612 --> 01:27:25,155
(Ruby) Damn! You knocked
that bitch cold!

838
01:27:25,281 --> 01:27:28,742
(man) Look at her!
What they doin' to her in there?

839
01:28:00,066 --> 01:28:01,108
Oh, shit.

840
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:21,712
I know you're in here.

841
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:24,715
You're not gettin' out.

842
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:27,676
Nobody gets out.

843
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:29,678
(cocks gun) Nobody.

844
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:32,723
Fool!

845
01:28:35,727 --> 01:28:38,186
(Ruby) Fool? That you?

846
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:51,658
Listen. There's a way out for you guys,
if you can get past the man.

847
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:57,456
The door to the outside cellar
got left open.

848
01:28:57,582 --> 01:29:02,002
There you can get outside.
To the sun, to the birds.

849
01:29:02,879 --> 01:29:05,172
To the women.

850
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:10,344
You wanna give me something?

851
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:25,692
A burglar alarm? No problem.
I've studied with the best.

852
01:29:29,697 --> 01:29:31,907
I can use these wires to bridge it.

853
01:29:34,577 --> 01:29:36,620
(gibbering)

854
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:03,438
No wonder there's no money in the ghetto.

855
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:14,950
Fool?

856
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:20,038
Fool! Fool!

857
01:30:20,164 --> 01:30:21,790
( door sIams)

858
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:24,501
Uh-oh. Your mama's gone.

859
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:28,755
Oh, shit. Where did that crazy heifer go?

860
01:30:35,346 --> 01:30:39,224
You guys see where she went?
Don't let her get away, you hear?

861
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:41,309
Wait a minute! Let us help you!

862
01:30:42,645 --> 01:30:44,896
Please! Open the door!

863
01:30:45,648 --> 01:30:48,150
We wanna help you!

864
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:58,493
System remote override.
AII doors locked.

865
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:03,957
(woman) You know I wouldn't
let you get away that easy.

866
01:31:28,774 --> 01:31:31,193
I see you.

867
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:36,823
And I see you, dearie.

868
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:40,952
(screams)

869
01:32:20,117 --> 01:32:22,702
You get back in there! Get back in there!

870
01:32:26,457 --> 01:32:28,750
Don't you touch me!

871
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:30,835
Don't you touch me! No!

872
01:33:25,057 --> 01:33:27,767
You hurt your mother.

873
01:33:27,893 --> 01:33:30,270
You're not my mother.

874
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:34,024
You never were.

875
01:33:45,369 --> 01:33:47,912
Then burn in hell!

876
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:04,721
Mommy!

877
01:34:38,214 --> 01:34:40,340
(coins jingle)

878
01:34:52,978 --> 01:34:55,271
(jingling)

879
01:35:16,836 --> 01:35:21,089
I know what you're doin'.
You're countin' that money.

880
01:35:21,215 --> 01:35:28,680
You're lettin' it roll through your fingers.
I've done it myself... a thousand times.

881
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:31,433
And I'll do it again.

882
01:35:31,559 --> 01:35:34,060
But you won't!

883
01:35:52,329 --> 01:35:53,246
Hey!

884
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:59,085
You shoot me and you die too, man.

885
01:35:59,211 --> 01:36:01,963
And you better believe it.

886
01:36:02,089 --> 01:36:06,801
Don't be crazy, now. There's enough
dynamite there to blow you sky-high.

887
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:10,263
Not the best place
to store it, in my opinion.

888
01:36:10,389 --> 01:36:13,141
But there it was. Just put the gun down.

889
01:36:14,935 --> 01:36:17,353
Put the gun down.

890
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:24,235
I don't wanna kill you, but I will,
cos I don't like you much anyway.

891
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:32,577
I'm tired of fuckin' around,
so either put the gun down now,...

892
01:36:32,703 --> 01:36:36,539
...or kiss your ass goodbye, boy.

893
01:36:44,006 --> 01:36:45,340
Oh, shit!

894
01:37:15,412 --> 01:37:17,163
All right!

895
01:37:17,289 --> 01:37:19,666
(yelling and cheering)

896
01:37:22,294 --> 01:37:24,337
Fool?

897
01:37:29,051 --> 01:37:31,344
Fool, are you OK?

898
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:38,977
I feel like a million dollars.

899
