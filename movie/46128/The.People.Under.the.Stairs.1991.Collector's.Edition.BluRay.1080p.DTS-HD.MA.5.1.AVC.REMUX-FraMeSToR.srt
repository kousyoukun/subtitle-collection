1
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,463
Swords and staves.

2
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,633
Tough road you got this year.

3
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,137
Judgement... Death...

4
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,515
...and Mr. Devil.

5
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,768
I'm glad it's your birthday
reading and not mine.

6
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,313
Now here's your card, Fool.
See?

7
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:06,358
- That's where I got your nickname.
- Don't remind me!

8
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,194
Here you go.
13 today.

9
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,696
The golden-haired
birthday boy is settin' off

10
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,156
on life's big adventure.

11
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,033
I ain't no
golden-haired nobody!

12
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,118
All I'm goin' on to
is seventh grade.

13
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,788
Well, you're the Fool
and you can't escape that.

14
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,540
- That ain't bad.
- No?

15
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,042
No.
Ain't the stupid kind of fool.

16
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,670
Only the ignorant kind,
'cause you're just startin' out.

17
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,588
That's better, I guess.

18
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:33,468
Ah, but look here.
Already he's got a problem, see?

19
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,346
One step in front:
The drop-off.

20
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,809
What about the dog?
That's Fool's companion.

21
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,811
See his spirit barking?

22
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,564
"Fool! Don't go marching
over that cliff, now."

23
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,775
"Do the smart thing.
The high thing."

24
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,778
So what Fool gonna do if
he ain't gonna go off the cliff?

25
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:52,779
Fly?

26
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,906
He gonna do
what he have to, Fool.

27
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,992
Turn around and
walk the other way,

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,994
right through the
fire of the sun.

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,079
He'll get burned
up if he do that.

30
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,290
Just the boy part
get burned up.

31
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,293
The rest come out
the other side a man.

32
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,921
And no one calls
him "Fool" again.

33
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:18,680
Just try to sleep, Mama.
There's nothing you can do.

34
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,933
Shh.

35
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,144
Shh.

36
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,521
Just rest, Mom.

37
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,029
Oh.

38
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,449
I don't know
what to do with this, Ruby.

39
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:40,493
I didn't think the
landlord would do this.

40
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,079
Not now.

41
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,540
Fool, you shouldn't be here.

42
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,584
Fool, go back to
reading your book.

43
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,752
What's wrong?

44
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,629
Nothing you can do.
Go on.

45
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,112
Who are you?

46
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,534
Leroy.
A friend of Ruby's.

47
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,497
You the little brother
she call Fool?

48
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,707
My real name's Poindexter,

49
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,251
but Ruby's hung up
on them tarot cards.

50
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,548
Why Mama cryin'?

51
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:40,512
Y'all been evicted. You gotta
be out tomorrow at midnight.

52
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,473
I guess Ruby didn't see
that one in the cards.

53
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,475
But why?

54
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,977
You're three days late
with your payment.

55
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,729
The fine print in
the lease says

56
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,731
you gotta pay triple
or else get out.

57
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,733
Your mama and Ruby
ain't got triple.

58
00:03:54,526 --> 00:04:00,115
Well, don't the landlord know that...
that Mama's sick or Ruby got babies?

59
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,534
Yeah, sure, he knows.
He don't care.

60
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,494
He wants to tear
down the building.

61
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,121
You're the last family in it.

62
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,290
You got some money
you can kick in?

63
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,260
I know where you can earn some.

64
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,679
You game?

65
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,199
One last family in the
Lenox Avenue building,

66
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,076
then it's clear to tear down.

67
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:49,414
We build a nice neat condominium,
we get clean people in there.

68
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,000
Lots of nice wood for
my fireplace, lots of nice-

69
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,753
- Money.
- And money.

70
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,671
For me.

71
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,715
Mama, what happens
to the people

72
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,009
when you make them
leave their home?

73
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,928
I don't believe
I was speaking to you.

74
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,056
Speak when spoken to,
that's what good girls do.

75
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,602
- You getting them out soon?
- By tomorrow midnight.

76
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,649
Damn buckshot.

77
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,056
Hey, Fool, I hear
you're gettin' evicted, man.

78
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:51,226
Your ass will be out
on the street like the rest of us!

79
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,520
Hey, come back here!

80
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,081
Hi, Fool.

81
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,417
He don't need
that kind of opportunity.

82
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,044
He's a good kid.
Let's keep him that way.

83
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,421
He work for me, he'd
do better than the rest of you.

84
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,298
Out of seven,
three's already dead.

85
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,844
Then there's you, baby,
turnin' tricks on the strip.

86
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,638
Willy's a crack addict,
and what's the other one's name,

87
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:29,889
what's he in jail for, assault?

88
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,100
Washington.
And he didn't do nothin'.

89
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,352
He tried to put food
on the damn table.

90
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,729
That's what I'm tryin'
to teach the boy to do.

91
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:40,316
- He wants to be a doctor.
- You can't even afford to pay rent!

92
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,986
How the hell are you gonna afford
to send him to medical school?

93
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,780
- It ain't right anyway.
- Oh, that right?

94
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,075
You know your mama
got a cancer in her

95
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,077
she can't afford
to have taken out.

96
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,203
Leroy!

97
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,789
A thing any doctor could
take out just like that.

98
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,165
But you ain't got no money!

99
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,293
And you ain't gonna
have no money unless...

100
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,628
Ow!
You little snot!

101
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,714
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me!

102
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,884
You listen up, you little punk.
Listen up!

103
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,554
Now, this is the big one and
somebody deserve to be robbed,

104
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,765
somebody who don't care about
families or the neighborhood.

105
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,560
He just wanna bring
the wreckin' ball in

106
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,437
so he can line his pockets.

107
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,689
Who you talkin' about?

108
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,318
The landlord, that's who.

109
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:27,155
- The landlord of this building?
- Yeah.

110
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,533
I found the treasure map last night
in the back room of the liquor store,

111
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:31,534
me and Spenser hit.

112
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,453
A letter addressed to the owner,

113
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,455
along with the
name of his company.

114
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,374
- So?
- So the name of the company

115
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,628
is the same as the name
on your eviction notice.

116
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,713
Same guy who
owns the liquor store

117
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,716
owns this building and half
the buildings in the ghetto.

118
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,636
I know where
your landlord lives.

119
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,264
No.

120
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,061
Leave him alone.
I heard things about him.

121
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,105
- Bad things.
- You heard about the gold?

122
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,735
This is from the company
that wants to buy

123
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,071
the coins the
landlord collected.

124
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:13,326
- Gold coins.
- You wanna be stupid, Leroy,

125
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,746
- you don't need Fool for that.
- We got a plan for him, baby.

126
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,457
Foolproof.

127
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,503
Or you want your family
eatin' beans out in the street?

128
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,350
One day I'm gonna buy you
a Cadillac for each foot, Mama.

129
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,145
And you're gonna skate
around town lookin' so bad.

130
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,775
Just take care of the kids,
Dexter.

131
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,947
You the man of the house now.

132
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,951
I'm tryin', Mama.

133
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,453
<i>I'm twin'.</i>

134
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,644
You didn't lick this, did you?

135
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,440
No, ma'am.

136
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,734
Stand up.

137
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,373
I hope this fits.
I worked all day.

138
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:46,419
Turn around.
Stand still.

139
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,176
- Do you love your mother?
- Yes, ma'am.

140
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,303
"Yes, ma'am" what?

141
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,513
Yes, ma'am,
I love you, Mother.

142
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,061
Good girl.

143
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,988
Where's your fork?

144
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:18,451
- Fork?
- I gave you a fork with this.

145
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,579
Where is your fork?

146
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,042
Well, it must have fallen...
somewhere.

147
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,877
- On the floor, maybe.
- You don't know?

148
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,922
No, I'm sure it's on the floor.
I mean, I know I dropped it.

149
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:34,258
You know the punishment
for losing silverware.

150
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,677
I'm sure it's right here.

151
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,015
I knew it was there.

152
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,693
Some niggers robbed the store.

153
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,948
Again?
May they burn in hell.

154
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,992
I'm very tense from this.

155
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,621
You have one of
your headaches?

156
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,747
Ooh.

157
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,625
I'm very, very tense about this.

158
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:11,254
Alice has been bad.

159
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,258
She's been feeding that thing
between the walls again.

160
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,426
No...

161
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,012
Remember not to bruise her face.

162
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:30,690
Bad girls... burn in hell.

163
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,277
There.

164
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:38,698
- Jesus. It goes on for ever.
- No bars on the windows.

165
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,492
No car in the driveway.
Maybe we lucked out.

166
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,580
- Where's Fool?
- He's goin' in, takin' it cool.

167
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,508
May I help you?

168
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,261
Good afternoon, ma'am.
Sorry to bother you,

169
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,595
but I'd just like
to show you

170
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,472
some of these delicious
cookies we're selling.

171
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:30,101
I'm sorry, we watch what
we eat very carefully here.

172
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:34,063
I know it's a bother,
but so is... cerebral palsy.

173
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:37,233
- And if we don't do all we can--
- I'm sorry.

174
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,986
Well, do you have, like,
a bathroom I could use?

175
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,572
They leave us out here all day
without anywhere to take a leak.

176
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:47,410
- No, sorry. Run along.
- That's all right.

177
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,328
No.
Run along.

178
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,914
That's OK.

179
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,591
Heavy wire screens
on the back windows.

180
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,219
They been hit before,
you think?

181
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,471
No, probably just
the neighborhood.

182
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,142
- How are the screens held on?
- Padlocks on the outside.

183
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:14,437
Padlocks on the outside?
Jeez. What else?

184
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,272
Any alarms?

185
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,691
Man, I don't know.
She wouldn't let me in.

186
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,360
I told you to tell
her you gotta piss.

187
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,820
She wasn't buyin' that.

188
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,618
- I wanna take a look.
- Don't be stupid, Spenser.

189
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,871
The kid told us all
there was to see.

190
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,372
We go in Sunday as planned.

191
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,000
What if they got a
remote alarm to the police?

192
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,128
I'm not going in Sunday without
checking out the security.

193
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,213
Just look at the doors,
the basement,

194
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,673
maybe the connector boxes.

195
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,508
How the hell are
you gonna get in?

196
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,719
She wouldn't even
let him up on the porch.

197
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:51,182
You send a boy to do a man's job,
that's what you get.

198
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,434
Anyway, if you thought

199
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,228
the Bear Scout disguise
was good, watch this.

200
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,707
- Help you?
- Gas company, ma'am.

201
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:21,504
Got an emergency. Got an emergency.
I need to check your meter.

202
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,714
You passed it on
your way up the drive.

203
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,466
Oh, that one we've already got.

204
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,010
There's one inside
the house I need to check.

205
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,763
There's none in the house.
I'm quite sure of that.

206
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,723
You're probably not
even aware of it, ma'am,

207
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,101
but it's on the master list here,
and I'm gonna have to check it.

208
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,602
See, the situation is we
got a leak on the block,

209
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,187
and it could be very dangerous.

210
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,730
Identification?

211
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,693
Fact is, we do have
the legal right to come in,

212
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,779
even if we do have
to call the police.

213
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,906
Not that we ever have.

214
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,457
It's just there have been an
awful lot of robberies lately.

215
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,377
The neighborhood's changing.
It has us all a bit on edge.

216
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,462
I completely understand.

217
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,924
Better this little bother than a
chance of danger, though, right?

218
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,057
I don't know how
he got past that woman.

219
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,684
She's got x-ray eyeballs.

220
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,978
Spenser's as
slippery as a snake.

221
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,565
- I think he's up to somethin'.
- Somethin' like what?

222
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:26,110
Like grabbin' that coin collection
for himself and cuttin' me out.

223
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,778
Cuttin' us out.

224
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,698
Spenser mess with you,
he gotta deal with me, too.

225
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,410
You somethin', Fool.

226
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,420
She leave him
alone in the place?

227
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,337
You gotta be kiddin'.

228
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,173
There has to be
someone else in there.

229
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,800
Old folks,
kids or something.

230
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,635
Maybe Spenser should
stick his ugly head out

231
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,387
and give us some
kind of signal.

232
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,639
Maybe he lookin'
around a little bit,

233
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,266
to make sure it's safe.

234
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,394
Maybe the president is gonna
make me Secretary of Pussy.

235
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,023
Now, he's probably in there
hiding the best for himself.

236
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,026
Come on.
We're goin' in.

237
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,030
No, Spenser said we gotta
stay out here, Leroy.

238
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,282
So he can get all the
good shit for himself?

239
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,867
Why not throw your mom
out in the street

240
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,869
along with Ruby and the kids?

241
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,861
See?

242
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,100
They in
Fort Knox or what?

243
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,434
Listen, Leroy.

244
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,479
This breakin' and enterin'
might not be so smart.

245
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,233
I mean, it's the first day
of my 13th birthday.

246
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,821
- Could be unlucky.
- 13th birthday is unlucky anyway.

247
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,366
Too old to get tit,
too young to get ass.

248
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,326
You're fucked either way.

249
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,500
Lord, now look at this.

250
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,758
The mother of all doors.

251
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,095
They ain't messin' around.

252
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,099
Spenser.

253
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,060
Spenser!

254
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,736
Uh, so, Leroy...

255
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:17,323
You think I got what it takes
to be a doctor?

256
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,326
Doctor of burglary, maybe.

257
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,995
You're lucky
I'm teachin' you a trade, kid.

258
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,206
Ain't no door
stands up to Leroy.

259
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,174
I done busted this
house's cherry.

260
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,135
It's opened right up now.

261
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,266
Get off him!

262
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:47,436
- Help me! Help!
- Leroy!

263
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,900
Hey, fuzzball!

264
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,443
Your mother sleeps with cats!

265
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,451
Run, Fool!

266
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,290
That's one mean motherfucker.
You see that?

267
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,668
He came at me like an
airplane or something.

268
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,211
I saw him all right.

269
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,388
He gone?

270
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,473
He's waitin' right there.

271
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,892
Been trained to wait there,
probably.

272
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,978
He'll stay out there,
and we stay right in here.

273
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,449
This place is weird.

274
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,536
"See no evil,
hear no evil, speak no evil."

275
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,705
Every cabinet has a lock on it.

276
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,918
Why do you think they do that?

277
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,214
Somebody need a bath, bad.

278
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,559
Nice to see the
rich folks got rats too.

279
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:12,730
Listen, Leroy, let's just
get outta here. Out the front.

280
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,524
First we find out what's up
with good old Spenser.

281
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,068
Man, the hell with Spenser.
Let's just get outta here.

282
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,946
The hell with those
gold coins too, huh?

283
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,615
Maybe you're too stupid
for this kinda work,

284
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,159
or maybe you're
too chickenshit.

285
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,167
Oh, there's that bastard now.

286
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,002
He's upstairs.

287
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,172
We'll surprise him.
Come on.

288
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:48,056
- You comin' or what?
- I'm comin'.

289
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,751
I don't think we should
go up there, Leroy.

290
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,337
Oh, that's fine,
girlfriend.

291
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:19,880
I tell you what.

292
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,007
You stay down here
and you keep an eye out.

293
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,718
You think you can do that?

294
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,057
Yeah, I can do that.

295
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,403
Man, there's enough room
for ten families in here.

296
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,657
Spenser!
Spenser, are you up here?

297
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,053
Spenser!

298
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,956
Spenser, you back in there?

299
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,044
I ain't stupid.

300
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,467
Or maybe you're just

301
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,136
too chickenshit for
this kinda work.

302
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,243
Fool.

303
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,085
Spenser?

304
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:05,605
Spenser?

305
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,482
How can
you say that of me?

306
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,776
I've never been unfaithful
to you, never even looked--

307
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,446
I'm not talking
about another woman, John.

308
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,197
I'm not talking
about that at all.

309
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,657
What's that
supposed to mean?

310
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:18,660
Connect the dots, John.
Everyone else has.

311
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,997
Ever since Paris.
Ever since Cybill killed herself.

312
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,082
Cybill's death
was a sailing accident.

313
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,459
There was
no accident, John.

314
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,670
Only survivor, John,
that's what I am: A survivor.

315
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:30,547
- Tiffany--
- I'm sorry, John.

316
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,049
Sorry for the both of us.

317
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,968
Sorry for the child
that we never had.

318
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,138
- And never will!
- Tiffany, don't get--

319
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,480
Now the anti-aircraft
battery, they're firing.

320
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,899
- Where?
- I think it's the barracks.

321
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:50,442
They're over by the
barracks and now

322
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,777
they're beginning to enter...

323
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:55,113
We can hear the staccato firing,
and now here it comes.

324
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,615
Baghdad is lighting up!

325
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,910
Tracers flaring up like...
like angry hornets

326
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,703
from every rooftop now.

327
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:04,122
We cannot see the bombers,

328
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,209
but the fire of their munitions
is shaking the city.

329
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,502
It's shaking our hotel.

330
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,796
Oh, look, there's
a cruise missile. See it?

331
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,965
There! Right over there,
flying just over the rooftops.

332
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,051
Spenser, you back in there?

333
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,393
No!

334
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,747
Spenser!

335
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,452
You can't do that,
you miserable stinkin' thing!

336
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,874
Come on, Spense.
I'm gonna get you outta here.

337
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,931
Man... this ain't right.

338
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,944
Who are you?

339
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,837
Leroy, we gotta
get outta this place!

340
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,148
Hello?
Miss?

341
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,262
Leroy.
Leroy!

342
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,941
Leroy?

343
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,122
- Leroy?
- Jesus!

344
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:17,500
- You scared the shit outta me.
- I thought you were dead!

345
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,128
- Leroy, you was just layin' there!
- A man ain't dead...

346
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,297
...just 'cause he's
layin' on the floor.

347
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:25,759
I was listenin'.
Something's in there.

348
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:29,304
As a matter of fact, why don't you
crawl in there and see what it is?

349
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,265
You turkey-brain!
Are you hittin' me

350
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,059
after I come up here
to save your ass?

351
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,435
You're gonna stick
your dumb head in there

352
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,354
and lose it just like Spenser!

353
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,938
What kinda shit you talkin'?

354
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,107
I'm talkin' we gotta
get outta here, Leroy.

355
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,484
The X-ray lady's back.

356
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,611
She's out back right
now by the van.

357
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,696
She got a man with her
the size of Detroit!

358
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,782
Damn.
You seen Spenser?

359
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,701
- I seen Spenser all right.
- He find anything?

360
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,455
Somethin' found him.
He's dead, Leroy.

361
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:57,707
I think scared to death.

362
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:02,337
- You sure?
- You thought he was white before?

363
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,798
You should see that sucker now!

364
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,104
There is somebody in there.
The door's been pried open.

365
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:22,065
- I told you there'd be another one.
- Out the front.

366
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,406
Oh, shit!

367
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,866
Oh, my hand!

368
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,663
Pry it open
at the bottom,

369
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,373
enough so Prince can get in.

370
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,051
- Come on, Fool!
- Agh! What are you doin'?

371
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:53,555
Stay here in the open
so the fuckin' dog can see you.

372
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:54,681
You think I'm crazy?

373
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,266
That mother got teeth
he ain't even used yet!

374
00:32:56,474 --> 00:33:00,228
Do like I say or I'm gonna
take your head off.

375
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,817
I'm gonna nail that sucker,
don't worry.

376
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,486
I'm worryin'.

377
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,196
- Kill him!
- Get him!

378
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,831
Uh-oh...

379
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,835
Where'd he go?

380
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,213
Shit!

381
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:33,344
Shit! Fuck off!

382
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,263
Fuck off!

383
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,557
Come on, Leroy!

384
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,392
What the hell
are you doin', Fool?!

385
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,269
Come on, come on!

386
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,782
I'm gonna take
your fuckin' head off!

387
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,118
Fuck you!

388
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,919
I heard him yell!
I heard him go down!

389
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,469
- I told you, don't mess with me.
- Man, I saved your body.

390
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,971
- Are these people crazy or what?
- You ask 'em!

391
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,057
Get in there, Daddy!
Get in there and get 'em!

392
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,684
Clear 'em out!
Make it safe for Mommy!

393
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,919
Ow! Damn!

394
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,428
Little doggy baby!
Someone is in here.

395
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,723
The people under the stairs
got the so-called gasman.

396
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:05,186
- The other one must be upstairs.
- Princey... Daddy'll get him.

397
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:09,399
That's a big-calibre automatic.
Did you ever see the holes they tear?

398
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,570
- We can hide under the bed.
- I ain't goin' in there, man.

399
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,572
There's something
about that place.

400
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,074
No room. Find your own.

401
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,289
Aha!

402
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:13,046
Run, Fool!

403
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:24,265
Yee-ha!</i>

404
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:27,185
Got him!

405
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,313
Oh, Daddy!

406
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,400
See that?
He came at me like a bull.

407
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,153
Just like a bull!
A big one!

408
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,990
- Did you hear what he called me?
- He called you a fool.

409
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,909
He's the fool!

410
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:45,953
The only good
fool's a dead one.

411
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,544
Better check upstairs.
Might be a mess.

412
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,380
I don't want a mess.
I better go look.

413
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,924
We might have
to mop up a little.

414
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,901
Thought I heard something.
Stay there.

415
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,454
Get back in the cellar, you little bastard.

416
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,212
You little animal shit!

417
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:22,049
I get the dog up here,
you'll be sorry.

418
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,133
My... my name is Fool.

419
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,346
- What's yours?
- Alice.

420
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:13,059
Don't be scared. You...
you never seen a brother before?

421
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:16,479
- I never had a brother.
- No, I mean a black dude.

422
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,607
There's black folks
in this neighborhood.

423
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,901
Neighborhood?

424
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,071
The neighborhood.

425
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,323
You know, outside?

426
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,785
Well, that's outside,
not in here.

427
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:33,246
So you get outside,
don't you?

428
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,917
Are... are you sayin' never?

429
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,503
Can't get out.
No one ever has.

430
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,464
Well... well,
I'm gonna get out.

431
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,967
I'm a whole other thing.

432
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,222
People have tried.

433
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,686
You... you mean the...
the people in the cellar?

434
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,069
Who are they?

435
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,365
Mommy and Daddy
looked a long time

436
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,409
to find the perfect boy child.

437
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,829
But each one they
found turned out bad.

438
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:17,206
Some saw things
they weren't supposed to.

439
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:20,209
Others heard too much,
others talked back.

440
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:26,465
Daddy cut out the bad parts
and put the boys in the cellar...

441
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,551
...one by one.

442
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:31,554
When they get flashlights
and food of some kind

443
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,307
I suppose they're happy
in their own way.

444
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,560
Yeah, right.

445
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,400
What about you?

446
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,654
How come they haven't
put you in the cellar?

447
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:56,329
I do not see, or hear,
or speak evil.

448
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,336
It's the only way.

449
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:13,679
- What is that?
- What?

450
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,515
- That yellin'. What is that?
- Well, that's Roach.

451
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,143
- Roach?
- That's who Daddy's hunting.

452
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:20,436
See, Daddy hates Roach

453
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,980
'cause he got out of the
cellar and into the walls.

454
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,608
And now Daddy can't find him.

455
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:45,252
- There must be another way out.
- Further into the house. Here.

456
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,837
The only way here.

457
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:50,007
Father's too big to follow and
he's afraid of what's in there.

458
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:54,220
- I don't want in, I want out.
- Sometimes in is out.

459
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,602
Forget it.

460
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,614
I hear ya!
I hear ya!

461
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:19,954
Yes.

462
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,124
Okay, I'll get in there.

463
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:51,652
I'm gonna get ya!

464
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,654
Yes!

465
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,289
I've got something
for my Princey, yes!

466
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:06,667
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

467
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,836
Good appetite.

468
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:13,424
Healthy Prince...
a secure home.

469
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,680
Stay.

470
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:24,185
The vehicle registration
matches the description

471
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,771
of a van used
in a 211 last night.

472
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:38,074
Daddy.
Police out back.

473
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:44,455
Damn.

474
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:04,183
Hey, police!
Police!

475
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:11,023
Police! Police!

476
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:15,111
Hello. What can I do
for you, gentlemen?

477
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,738
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Is this your van?

478
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:20,783
Goodness, no.
It was just standing here

479
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,576
when we got back from shopping.

480
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,120
Did you see anybody
around when you pulled in?

481
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,371
Trouble?

482
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,874
Well, as a matter of fact,
we did see a couple of men,

483
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,001
one black, one white,

484
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,212
walking away
as we approached.

485
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,881
We thought they were
service people of some sort.

486
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,092
You know they were
working on your door.

487
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,344
- No harm done.
- We'll check the house.

488
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:41,637
Just checked it.

489
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,223
Even looked under the beds.
Clean as a whistle.

490
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,725
Well, let's recon
the neighborhood.

491
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,478
Do you get a lot
of this sort of thing?

492
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,021
It's as if we're the prisoners

493
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,816
- and the criminals roam free.
- I know what you mean.

494
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:55,192
You're lucky you're alright.

495
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,987
This van was used in a
liquor store robbery last night.

496
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:00,906
- Oh, goodness.
- Liquor store?

497
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,616
I'd advise you to stay inside,

498
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,577
keep your doors
locked for a while.

499
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:07,079
You can count on it.

500
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,920
Hope you catch 'em.

501
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:19,633
- Catch 'em in hell.
- Oh my God.

502
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:24,096
- What?
- There's not just the two.

503
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,351
There's a boy.

504
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,271
He's in there right now...

505
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,733
...with our little angel!

506
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,142
God! What are they feedin' you?

507
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,744
What is it, boy?

508
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,602
You come in here
and I'm gonna kick your ass!

509
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,981
Come on, come on!

510
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,459
Gonna kill you!

511
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,968
Kill.

512
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:30,389
Kill them!

513
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,705
Is this your place?

514
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:09,803
- What hit you?
- The damn Bear Trooper.

515
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,305
But Prince is after him.

516
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,724
He'll kill him before
he gets to Alice.

517
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:24,276
Let's do somethin'!

518
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,540
Do you hear something?

519
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,221
The boy's gotten to Alice.

520
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:13,242
Thanks.

521
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,664
He doesn't talk much, does he?

522
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:22,042
His... his tongue's cut out.

523
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:27,339
Oh, man!

524
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:31,093
Mommy caught him trying to
call for help one day, and...

525
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:35,180
- Daddy had to teach him...
- Speak no evil, right?

526
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:40,436
Your father's one sick mother,
you know that?

527
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:43,689
Actually, your mother's
one sick mother, too.

528
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:45,524
Shh!

529
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,443
You're speaking evil.

530
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:51,029
They'd kill you if they
heard a word you just said.

531
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:56,660
Roach.
Roach is my friend.

532
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,745
Roach?

533
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:03,959
I'm Poindexter.
Everybody calls me Fool.

534
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:05,794
Fool?

535
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,590
We sure got the names, huh?

536
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,350
Is this Leroy?

537
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:28,025
You did this?
Why do you make these?

538
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:31,612
To hold the souls of
burglars when they died.

539
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:37,034
Or salesmen, workmen...
other people who saw too much.

540
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:50,297
There she is!

541
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,346
You viper in my bosom!

542
00:50:57,513 --> 00:51:00,724
- You little Judas!
- What do I do with him, Mommy?

543
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:03,810
It is time to clean house!

544
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:10,692
Total spring cleaning.

545
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:15,447
OK, let's move it!
Pull, you little piece of shit!

546
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,825
No, wait a minute!

547
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:36,051
I am sick and tired
of your attitude!

548
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,554
You will do your chore now!

549
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,433
Clean it up, for God's sake!

550
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,228
What is a mother to do?

551
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:51,233
Lazy brat sits in her room
all day, sewing dolls!

552
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:55,612
Children misbehaving
in the basement!

553
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,073
And one in the walls,

554
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:02,119
doing his business
God knows where!

555
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,664
You kids'll be the death of me!

556
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,668
The death of me.

557
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:42,034
I keep 'em real hungry.

558
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,997
I ask a simple thing:

559
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:52,502
Just clean up that awful man's
blood and what do you do?

560
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:57,215
You get it all over your nice clean
dress I worked so hard to make!

561
00:52:57,382 --> 00:53:00,093
Now get in that tub
and scrub yourself!

562
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,179
No!

563
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:04,973
Don't wanna get in, huh?
Well, let me help you!

564
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,854
You scrub yourself!

565
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:15,025
You scrub yourself! It's hot!

566
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:18,070
The fires of hell are hotter!

567
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:37,297
No! Don't put me in there!

568
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,591
No! No!

569
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,976
No!

570
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,526
Where's the Bear Trooper?

571
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:03,198
Dead meat.

572
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:09,913
I could've killed him, but I let
the people under the stairs do it.

573
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:31,518
Leave me alone!

574
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:35,689
Get away from me!

575
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,464
Roach.

576
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,343
It's right there, Roach.

577
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:12,309
I told you to
keep quiet down there!

578
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:13,602
You're drivin' me nuts!

579
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,061
Pull it!

580
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,441
Guard 'em, Prince.
Guard 'em.

581
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:24,404
Noisy bastards.

582
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:29,367
If I have to come down there,
you're gonna be sorry.

583
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:37,209
Roach, you're shot.
We gotta get you to a hospital.

584
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,912
The coin collection.

585
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,122
Leroy was right.

586
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,755
Thanks, Roach.

587
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,364
Alice is up there?

588
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:03,378
Roach!

589
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:07,132
Roach...

590
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:28,445
Get outta here!
Get! Go!

591
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,629
What did he do to you?

592
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,590
I told you never to
talk to anybody!

593
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:52,177
You hear me? Come here!
You answer me!

594
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:54,471
Did you tell him anything?

595
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:58,308
If you did,
you know what I'll do.

596
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:01,144
I killed your skinny
friend in the walls.

597
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:03,188
Now what do you think of that?

598
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:09,694
Oh, I got him good.
And the black one, too.

599
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,910
Shut the fuck up!

600
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:22,832
What the hell's wrong with him?

601
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:29,089
- He said he killed you.
- He exaggerated.

602
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:38,014
Come on!

603
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:40,976
Stay!

604
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:51,861
Keep moving, Alice.

605
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,738
He finds us here,
he'll shoot through the walls.

606
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,992
- My dress is stuck on something.
- Oh, great.

607
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:04,666
Uh-oh. You gotta keep going, Alice.
Come on.

608
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:13,883
Burn in hell for gettin' free and
burn in hell for showin' the way!

609
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:29,566
Who turned on the heat?

610
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:37,282
Burn! Burn!

611
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:39,576
Burn in hell!

612
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,289
Burn!

613
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:49,544
Burn in hell!

614
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:56,384
Alice, he's comin' closer.
We gotta get outta here.

615
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,000
Which way?

616
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:31,294
Only Roach knew the
way through the walls.

617
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:33,296
So we'll explore.

618
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,590
Gonna find you!

619
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:38,093
- I gotta sneeze.
- Gonna kill ya!

620
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:50,355
Shh! If he can't hear us,
he can't shoot us.

621
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:07,664
- We gotta be careful.
- Real careful.

622
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:11,209
- Do you think you got him?
- We'll soon find out. Come on.

623
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:13,711
Come on.
Kill. Kill. Kill.

624
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:16,631
Kill! Kill 'em, Prince.
Kill 'em!

625
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,050
Kill 'em!

626
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:22,428
Shh! I think I just
heard something.

627
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,349
Come on!

628
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,856
I'm not runnin' any more.

629
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:35,316
Come on!

630
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,742
Alice!

631
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,507
Alice, get back!

632
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:18,484
Get away from the wall!
Get away from the wall!

633
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:20,486
Get away from the wall!

634
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,971
Gotcha.

635
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:51,476
Gotcha!

636
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,403
Jesus.

637
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,989
I got him! I got him!

638
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:07,992
I got him, I got him, I got him!
I sot him, I got him!

639
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:11,120
I got him, I got him, I got him!
I sot him, I got him!

640
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,873
I got him, I got him, I got him!

641
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,125
Prove it.

642
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:22,131
Hey!
Hey, wait a minute.

643
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:26,261
There's light up there.
Come on.

644
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:40,066
I know you're in there,
you little piece of shit.

645
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:43,236
Oh, no!

646
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:50,243
Oh, shit.

647
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:52,620
You killed Prince!

648
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:55,999
I didn't
mean to do it!

649
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,437
Look, you can see the lights
of the ghetto from here.

650
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:20,523
I never thought
smog could smell so good.

651
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:24,444
- Help!
- Shh!

652
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:27,989
- We might have to climb down.
- There's nothing to hold on to.

653
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,199
It's just a straight
drop off the roof.

654
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,076
- Wait a minute.
- What?

655
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:33,703
The water in the garden.

656
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:36,039
I think it's right
under this window.

657
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:38,833
If we take a jump off the edge,
we might be able to hit it.

658
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,669
- I don't know how deep it is.
- I hear 'em!

659
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:45,465
- Alice, come on. We gotta jump!
- I can't! I'm afraid.

660
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:47,550
You upstairs, Alice?

661
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:50,219
- Alice!
- What's out there?

662
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:53,890
There he is!

663
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:02,357
What were you doin' with him?
Come here.

664
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,650
Alice! Alice!

665
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:13,242
No! No! No! No!

666
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:22,377
Damn it.

667
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:40,019
I'll be back, Alice!
Hang on!

668
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:44,816
- Bastard!
- I'll be back!

669
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:47,610
Never shoot your gun outside!

670
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,698
- He got away.
- Come back inside.

671
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,122
Damn it.

672
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,626
Bad boy!
Go on.

673
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:09,715
Go straight to your room
and get into your suit.

674
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:14,679
If these had come
from anybody else,

675
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:16,931
I'd make you take
'em straight back.

676
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:19,392
- You know that?
- Yes, sir.

677
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:24,313
Well, figurin' the
rarity of these...

678
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,984
you do have enough
to pay your rent for a while.

679
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:31,237
Say, to the year 2000.

680
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:36,617
- And Mama's operation?
- And your mama's operation.

681
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:41,539
Keep hold of
these till tomorrow.

682
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:45,168
I'm gonna order
an ambulance for your mama.

683
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:48,504
Tomorrow we'll take those
to a good coin dealer,

684
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,256
and we'll all be smilin'.

685
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:52,717
Meanwhile, you be careful.

686
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:56,721
That brother-sister act you messed
with are evil, plain and simple.

687
01:06:56,888 --> 01:06:59,348
Wait a minute.
Brother and sister?

688
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,392
Brother and sister.

689
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:05,354
Tail end of the craziest
family you ever heard of,

690
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:08,566
every generation more insane
than the one before it.

691
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:11,986
Started out as a family
runnin' a funeral home,

692
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:16,365
sellin' cheap coffins
for expensive prices.

693
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:19,285
Then they got their fingers
into real estate,

694
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:22,371
started makin' a lot of money
takin' over people's homes.

695
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:25,208
The more money they got,
the greedier they got.

696
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:28,294
The greedier they got,
the crazier they got.

697
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:32,798
All sorts of rumors about
what's gone on in that place.

698
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:37,345
Never proved it because the
police didn't take it serious.

699
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:39,514
But believe me,
when I was a kid,

700
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:42,016
none of us ever
walked past that house.

701
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:52,151
You OK, Fool?

702
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:56,906
I was just tellin' Mama that
I did somethin' wrong, real wrong.

703
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,450
And now I gotta
do somethin' right.

704
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:02,036
I clone the tarot cards
on you again.

705
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:03,704
They come up real scary.

706
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:06,290
Don't go messin'
with them people again.

707
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:14,298
Somebody has to.
And maybe that means me.

708
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:19,512
Anyway, I made a promise
to Alice and I'm gonna keep it.

709
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:52,837
- 14th Precinct.
- Hello. Police?

710
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:53,921
Yes, this is the police.

711
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,674
I'd like to report a case
of child abuse going on.

712
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:59,760
- All right. When did this happen?
- Right now.

713
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:06,726
- Is this real or what?
- Bogus. The place is clean.

714
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:10,730
The people don't even have kids.
They have coffee, though.

715
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:14,150
I'm gonna go
upstairs and look around.

716
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:18,613
- More coffee?
- No, thank you. I've had plenty.

717
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:29,540
I'm so sorry you
all had to come out

718
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:32,543
at such an hour
for such a silly thing.

719
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:41,802
But, you know, it's better
there are a few false calls

720
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:45,389
if we can prevent just one
child from being abused.

721
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:48,684
- Mm-hm. Absolutely right.
- Cream and sugar?

722
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:18,506
Nice furniture.

723
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:21,050
You didn't get that stuff
at Price Club, that's for sure.

724
01:10:21,258 --> 01:10:23,594
- It's been in the family for years.
- Yeah?

725
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:28,015
Used to be the house
was used for, uh... business.

726
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,059
- No kidding?
- Sergeant?

727
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:32,144
I think there's something
here you might wanna see.

728
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:34,897
- What?
- Take a look.

729
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:46,992
I thought you said
you had no kids.

730
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:49,453
Alice left us a long
time ago, Sergeant.

731
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:52,206
The Lord saw fit to
come and take her.

732
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:54,750
Never touched the room since.

733
01:10:55,710 --> 01:11:01,006
We're foolish, I suppose, but...
in a sense, she still lives here.

734
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,596
- And always will.
- My apologies.

735
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:09,724
It must be very painful for you.

736
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:13,144
I'm sorry about this.
This should have never happened.

737
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:15,855
No need to apologise.
We wanna be helpful.

738
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:20,860
- Good night, sir.
- Thanks for the refreshments.

739
01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:22,445
You're welcome.
Good night!

740
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:27,533
I don't want to see another
cop or cookie in my life!

741
01:11:28,492 --> 01:11:31,036
I don't know which one
makes me sicker.

742
01:11:31,203 --> 01:11:33,372
May they burn in hell.

743
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:37,960
Forever and ever in hell.

744
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:55,936
- The shelf worked.
- Yup.

745
01:11:57,021 --> 01:12:00,483
Always does.
Simple works best.

746
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,028
Gotta get a new dog tomorrow.

747
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:06,280
A good big one.

748
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:15,498
I was worried.

749
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:18,125
The police left the back
door open for so long.

750
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:20,628
- So?
- I couldn't watch it all the time.

751
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:24,507
- Think any of 'em got out?
- Nah. They were pretty out of it.

752
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:28,219
- What'd you use?
- Horse tranquillizers.

753
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:38,330
Tomorrow I'm gonna
look for the Bear Trooper.

754
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:40,916
- Where would you look?
- The ghetto.

755
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:44,503
I'll find him.
And I'll kill him.

756
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:50,175
- Night, Mama.
- Night, Daddy.

757
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:53,846
- Say your prayers like a good boy.
- Oh! I forgot.

758
01:13:56,181 --> 01:13:58,684
Now I lay me
down to sleep...

759
01:13:59,476 --> 01:14:02,229
Now I lay me
down to sleep...

760
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:05,983
I pray the
Lord my soul to keep.

761
01:14:06,191 --> 01:14:10,404
If I should kill
before I wake...

762
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:14,116
I pray the
Lord my soul to take.

763
01:14:14,325 --> 01:14:18,162
I pray the Lord
my soul to take.

764
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:32,843
Ah!
You miserable little shit!

765
01:14:35,512 --> 01:14:37,056
Shut up!

766
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:43,687
You hurt my baby!

767
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:49,193
Get him!
Get him!

768
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:03,374
Get him! He's getting away!

769
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:06,961
"Downstairs door."

770
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:31,610
- Did you get him?
- He's fast, damn it!

771
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:33,529
Open the kitchen.

772
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:42,121
Oh, shit!

773
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:45,040
What happened?
Did he get out?

774
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:48,002
Oh!
Burn in hell.

775
01:15:48,585 --> 01:15:50,504
Burn in hell.

776
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:54,258
What about Alice?
What'll we do with her?

777
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:56,844
Let her hang
up there all night.

778
01:15:57,052 --> 01:16:02,641
- She's terrified of the attic.
- I know. It serves her right.

779
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:31,503
- Alice!
- Fool?

780
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:34,590
Are you OK?

781
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,177
Alice, can you get any
more of these bricks out?

782
01:16:38,385 --> 01:16:41,472
- I can't. They've got me stuck.
- How?

783
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,224
I'm tied to a bolt
in the chimney.

784
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:47,478
This one?

785
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:55,819
Yes.

786
01:16:56,904 --> 01:16:59,198
- Hi.
- Hi.

787
01:17:01,533 --> 01:17:04,119
Let's see if we can get
some more of these bricks out.

788
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:05,621
Alright.

789
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:10,876
Shh!
Get clown!

790
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:28,102
Let me down, please.

791
01:17:34,108 --> 01:17:38,112
Daddy! Come down from
there and help me to bed!

792
01:17:38,946 --> 01:17:40,864
Daddy!

793
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:52,084
I said now!

794
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,714
He's gone.
Fool?

795
01:17:58,632 --> 01:18:00,551
Fool?

796
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:04,763
Meet me at the window.
You know the one.

797
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:06,348
OK.

798
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:09,810
- You find him, bring him back to me.
- I will!

799
01:18:09,977 --> 01:18:13,188
I'll take him under the stairs
and do him like the others.

800
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:17,442
- Only it won't be his ears I cut off.
- His balls!

801
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:20,529
Here, hold this.

802
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:30,914
Listen, Alice.

803
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:33,000
- They're not your real parents.
- What?

804
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:35,836
They're not.
They're not even husband and wife.

805
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:39,631
They stole you, like they did
Roach and all the others.

806
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:42,301
They're a bunch of
rotten baby snatchers.

807
01:18:42,467 --> 01:18:46,096
- You're just saying that.
- My grandfather Booker told me.

808
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:48,599
He wouldn't lie to me.

809
01:18:51,351 --> 01:18:53,562
What do we do now?

810
01:18:54,646 --> 01:18:56,690
Feel up to a little jump?

811
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:01,236
The problem is, first thing he did
when you escaped was drain it

812
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:04,114
and put broken glass
and rocks in the bottom.

813
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:05,574
That's a problem.

814
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:08,660
The way we came up before
he's got fixed now.

815
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:16,960
Wait!
Look.

816
01:19:17,127 --> 01:19:19,213
This place
is one big bomb.

817
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,757
He's got 'em
all over the house.

818
01:19:22,216 --> 01:19:25,928
- Think you could climb the roof?
- What's up there?

819
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:31,475
The only way out.

820
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:41,068
How dare he come
into our happy home?

821
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:42,861
He came back to get Alice!

822
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:46,865
- You should have let me kill her.
- You stay away from Alice!

823
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:49,952
- She did it with him, I know it.
- Not my little girl!

824
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:52,162
She's a whore!

825
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,342
What is that?

826
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:20,065
Oh, God!

827
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:25,279
That hurts so bad!

828
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:29,491
See him?

829
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:33,704
I can't see shit!

830
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,623
Let me see the brick.

831
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:39,251
Hold it.
I think I hear somethin'.

832
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:40,752
Bombs away.

833
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:42,170
No!

834
01:20:42,587 --> 01:20:44,798
Argh!

835
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:48,218
I guess it was one
of those smart bricks.

836
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:50,971
You bastard!

837
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:54,474
Come on. You can do it.
Just brace yourself on the sides.

838
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:57,644
(moaning?

839
01:21:01,064 --> 01:21:03,400
This is it.
Hang on.

840
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:05,402
You're mine now!

841
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:12,367
The gun!

842
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,387
Ca-ca!

843
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:36,641
- Okay, hold it here.
- What?

844
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:38,477
- Do you know where we are?
- Uh-uh.

845
01:21:38,685 --> 01:21:41,146
There's the living room.
Get out the back door.

846
01:21:41,355 --> 01:21:44,941
- Fool, come with me.
- I'm not finished with them yet.

847
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:50,614
- Fool...
- Go!

848
01:21:50,822 --> 01:21:53,742
I'm gonna get the shotgun,
set those kids free.

849
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:19,101
I...
I will get them.

850
01:22:37,077 --> 01:22:40,288
- Fool! Fool!
- Shh!

851
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:48,547
Hold it right there!

852
01:22:49,673 --> 01:22:52,467
Where is that little bastard?
Tell me!

853
01:22:52,676 --> 01:22:55,887
- Tell me!
- I... I won't tell you.

854
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:58,390
We will get him
out of our house!

855
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:04,187
He's filthy! He's bad.
He's awful!

856
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:11,236
Go to hell!

857
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:17,868
Eldon!

858
01:23:18,618 --> 01:23:22,956
Oh, God! He's turned
my little girl against me!

859
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:27,169
I told you.
Those two...

860
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:30,213
Then she can burn in hell.

861
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:33,717
Both of them.

862
01:23:43,226 --> 01:23:46,146
She doesn't have a key.
She's still in here!

863
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:11,004
- She's in the cellar.
- No way.

864
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,965
Then he is.

865
01:24:18,094 --> 01:24:20,013
You know a prayer?

866
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:22,015
You say it.

867
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:35,070
Shoot her if you see her.

868
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:46,081
Come here!

869
01:24:55,257 --> 01:24:57,259
See your friends?

870
01:25:01,972 --> 01:25:04,182
- Get him?
- Oh, yeah.

871
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:12,691
Shh! It may be the police again.
Hold on.

872
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:35,922
My name is Ruby Williams

873
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:38,758
and I represent the Association
of People Unjustly Evicted,

874
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:41,886
- "Exploited and Generally Fucked Over.
- What?

875
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:44,973
You and your brother are landlords
of over 50 building in this city,

876
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,224
all of which which
you've allowed

877
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:47,851
to deteriorate into
rat-infested hellholes

878
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:50,687
while you guys get rich
charging ridiculous rents!

879
01:25:50,895 --> 01:25:54,441
Then you evict anyone
the minute they can't pay rent

880
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:56,860
so you can tear down their homes
and build some more office buildings.

881
01:25:57,027 --> 01:26:00,447
- Ain't that about right?
- None of your goddamn business!

882
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:06,828
Kill the little bugger!

883
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:09,664
Kiss your ass goodbye, boy.

884
01:26:19,924 --> 01:26:24,512
- What the hell is going on?!
- He's loose again! Damn it.

885
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:28,475
Police! Open up!

886
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:29,976
Shh!

887
01:26:33,229 --> 01:26:36,524
Police!
We have reports of gunfire!

888
01:26:36,733 --> 01:26:40,111
If you do not open this door,
we'll break it down!

889
01:26:45,742 --> 01:26:49,162
- Get off my property!
- Just want to finish sayin' our piece.

890
01:26:49,329 --> 01:26:52,666
Not only are you bad landlords
but ten times worse,

891
01:26:52,832 --> 01:26:57,212
you've stolen children from our
community for your own sick needs.

892
01:26:57,420 --> 01:27:00,507
There's no community here.

893
01:27:01,675 --> 01:27:03,760
All I see are a couple of n--

894
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:06,137
Ruby!
We're right here.

895
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:11,184
We busted
your ass, bitch!

896
01:27:12,686 --> 01:27:15,814
What are you gonna do?
Shoot us all?

897
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:17,899
- You'll do!
- No!

898
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:24,989
Damn!
You knocked that bitch cold!

899
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:28,702
Look at her!
What they doin' to her in there?

900
01:27:59,357 --> 01:28:01,317
Oh, shit.

901
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:21,629
I know you're in here.

902
01:28:21,796 --> 01:28:24,507
You're not gettin' out.

903
01:28:24,674 --> 01:28:27,385
Nobody gets out.

904
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:29,220
Nobody.

905
01:28:30,346 --> 01:28:32,432
Fool!

906
01:28:35,769 --> 01:28:37,479
Fool? That you?

907
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:48,948
Listen.

908
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:52,076
There's a way out for you guys,
if you can get past the man.

909
01:28:53,953 --> 01:28:57,040
The door to the outside cellar
got left open.

910
01:28:57,248 --> 01:29:02,128
There you can get outside.
To the sun, to the birds.

911
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:04,547
To the women.

912
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:09,594
You wanna give me something?

913
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:25,777
A burglar alarm? No problem.
I've studied with the best.

914
01:29:29,656 --> 01:29:31,783
I can use these wires
to bridge it.

915
01:30:00,979 --> 01:30:03,565
No wonder there's
no money in the ghetto.

916
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:14,659
Fool?

917
01:30:16,786 --> 01:30:19,455
Fool! Fool!

918
01:30:21,332 --> 01:30:24,210
Uh-oh. Your mama's gone.

919
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:28,840
Oh, shit.
Where did that crazy heifer go?

920
01:30:35,054 --> 01:30:38,725
You guys see where she went?
Don't let her get away, you hear?

921
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:41,477
Wait a minute!
Let us help you!

922
01:30:42,896 --> 01:30:44,689
Please! Open the door!

923
01:30:45,607 --> 01:30:47,442
We wanna help you!

924
01:30:55,533 --> 01:30:58,786
System remote override.
All doors locked.

925
01:31:00,163 --> 01:31:03,666
You know I wouldn't
let you get away that easy.

926
01:31:29,067 --> 01:31:31,361
I see you.

927
01:31:34,405 --> 01:31:36,741
And I see you, dearie.

928
01:32:20,326 --> 01:32:23,037
You get back in there!
Get back in there!

929
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:28,501
Don't you touch me!

930
01:32:28,710 --> 01:32:31,295
Don't you touch me! No!

931
01:32:31,504 --> 01:32:33,297
(shouts,

932
01:33:25,016 --> 01:33:27,518
You hurt your mother.

933
01:33:27,685 --> 01:33:30,021
You're not my mother.

934
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:33,524
You never were.

935
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:47,663
Then burn in hell!

936
01:34:02,345 --> 01:34:04,222
Mommy!

937
01:34:43,803 --> 01:34:48,099
Fool!
Fool! Fool!

938
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:21,007
I know what you're doin'.
You're countin' that money.

939
01:35:21,174 --> 01:35:23,843
You're lettin' it roll
through your fingers.

940
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:28,222
I've done it myself...
a thousand times.

941
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:30,975
And I'll do it again.

942
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:32,852
But you won't!

943
01:35:52,246 --> 01:35:53,289
Hey!

944
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:58,628
You shoot me and you die too, man.

945
01:35:58,794 --> 01:36:01,380
And you better believe it.

946
01:36:02,256 --> 01:36:03,507
Don't be crazy, now.

947
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:07,220
There's enough dynamite back
there to blow you sky-high.

948
01:36:07,637 --> 01:36:10,223
Not the best place
to store it, in my opinion.

949
01:36:10,389 --> 01:36:12,934
But there it was.
Just put the gun down.

950
01:36:14,685 --> 01:36:17,021
Put the gun down.

951
01:36:19,398 --> 01:36:24,612
I don't wanna kill you, but I will,
'cause I don't like you much anyway.

952
01:36:28,282 --> 01:36:32,411
I'm tired of fuckin' around,
so either put the gun down now,

953
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:36,415
or kiss your ass goodbye, boy.

954
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:46,217
Oh, shit!

955
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:17,123
All right!

956
01:37:22,086 --> 01:37:24,005
Fool?

957
01:37:28,592 --> 01:37:30,720
Fool, are you OK?

958
01:37:36,475 --> 01:37:38,436
I feel like a million dollars.
