1
00:00:59,932 --> 00:01:02,662
Dragon Tiger Gate was founded...

2
00:01:02,868 --> 00:01:04,631
by 2 kungfu masters:

3
00:01:04,836 --> 00:01:07,270
Wong Jianglong and Wong Fuhu.

4
00:01:07,706 --> 00:01:10,766
They promoted self-strengthening...

5
00:01:11,343 --> 00:01:13,834
to free people from oppression.

6
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:16,008
They even taught martial arts...

7
00:01:16,214 --> 00:01:19,183
to street urchins.

8
00:01:19,985 --> 00:01:22,977
The Gate thus became
the symbol of Justice.

9
00:01:23,422 --> 00:01:26,880
While every youth
was eager to join the Gate...

10
00:01:27,225 --> 00:01:30,194
Wong Fuhu's son,

11
00:01:30,395 --> 00:01:32,226
Dragon,

12
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:34,558
decided to leave.

13
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:36,725
He was to part

14
00:01:36,935 --> 00:01:38,766
with his baby brother,

15
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:40,700
Tiger.

16
00:02:20,278 --> 00:02:21,711
Shibumi

17
00:02:23,615 --> 00:02:27,551
Rosa, Ma Kun's been doing a good job.

18
00:02:27,753 --> 00:02:30,187
I decide to continue our collaboration.

19
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:32,357
Give him the Lousha Plaque.

20
00:02:32,557 --> 00:02:35,492
Ask him to keep up his work!

21
00:02:36,461 --> 00:02:40,659
Remember, the Plaque
represents Lousha Gang.

22
00:02:46,738 --> 00:02:48,729
I've given you the Lousha Plaque.

23
00:02:49,174 --> 00:02:50,038
Don't let anything

24
00:02:50,242 --> 00:02:52,210
happen to it.

25
00:02:54,713 --> 00:02:57,443
I know. I'll do my best.

26
00:03:10,195 --> 00:03:11,719
What a coincidence!

27
00:03:12,364 --> 00:03:13,729
Still remember me?

28
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:17,793
- Xiao... - That's right!

29
00:03:18,203 --> 00:03:19,864
So you still remember me!

30
00:03:21,473 --> 00:03:24,374
Grade 5?

31
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,174
Not Grade 5! Grade 3!

32
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:30,780
Almost the same.

33
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:36,115
Not at all. What a poor memory!

34
00:03:36,421 --> 00:03:39,049
Remember the fatso in our class?

35
00:03:39,257 --> 00:03:41,748
Sure, the one who bawled all the time?

36
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:46,053
No, the one who wetted his pants!

37
00:03:47,365 --> 00:03:49,526
Well, he bawled after
he wetted his pants!

38
00:03:49,835 --> 00:03:52,235
I remember he liked pulling your plait!

39
00:03:52,604 --> 00:03:56,096
It couldn't be! I had short hair then.

40
00:03:59,444 --> 00:04:01,378
I remember you had long hair!

41
00:04:02,481 --> 00:04:04,847
How can I forget I had short hair?

42
00:04:05,383 --> 00:04:08,318
Like, would you forget
you're called Chan?

43
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:13,185
Look who has a poor memory?

44
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:15,985
I'm not Chan, Xiaowei!

45
00:04:24,603 --> 00:04:26,867
I'm not Xiaowei!

46
00:04:32,544 --> 00:04:34,307
- I'm sorry! - I'm sorry!

47
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,981
So what's your name?

48
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:46,251
Tiger Wong.

49
00:04:46,558 --> 00:04:47,889
I'm Ma Xiaoling.

50
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:12,614
- Hey - Hey, Tiger!

51
00:05:12,818 --> 00:05:13,682
Why so many people?

52
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:16,445
Ma Kun has reserved...

53
00:05:16,655 --> 00:05:17,815
the whole upper floor.

54
00:05:18,023 --> 00:05:19,081
Ma Kun?

55
00:05:19,357 --> 00:05:21,484
The biggest kingpin in Hong Kong.

56
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:24,924
Those dudes in black are his dogs.

57
00:05:31,336 --> 00:05:33,463
Some dudes in white are barging in!

58
00:05:35,974 --> 00:05:39,137
They're the White Lions.
As powerful as Kun!

59
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:40,641
Black or white,

60
00:05:40,846 --> 00:05:42,541
they're still bad guys!

61
00:05:45,984 --> 00:05:48,509
Kun, so you got the Plaque again.

62
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,684
You have monopoly
over all smuggling gigs.

63
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:55,788
It takes juice to work with Lousha Gang.

64
00:05:55,994 --> 00:05:58,929
You gotta work harder!

65
00:05:59,698 --> 00:06:01,859
Juice? I got much more than you!

66
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:03,398
To hell with your gigs.

67
00:06:03,602 --> 00:06:05,433
I want half of your cut!

68
00:06:05,637 --> 00:06:07,366
You kiddin' or what?

69
00:06:07,606 --> 00:06:08,573
Whoever has the Plaque

70
00:06:08,773 --> 00:06:11,105
can get all the cut.

71
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:14,506
You want half? You outta your mind?

72
00:06:18,383 --> 00:06:20,715
Nice food! It's pay-up time!

73
00:06:22,454 --> 00:06:23,011
Mom!

74
00:06:23,221 --> 00:06:25,086
How dare you welsh

75
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,086
on our debts?

76
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,349
Not that I don't wanna pay.
We're the victims!

77
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:29,026
We've paid a lot already!

78
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:32,186
Let them be. They are Kun's dogs!

79
00:06:32,731 --> 00:06:35,928
Stay put! Master won't like it!

80
00:06:38,403 --> 00:06:40,803
Shibumi gave me the Plaque.

81
00:06:42,207 --> 00:06:44,198
Come get it if you dare!

82
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:54,874
Even if I let you go,

83
00:06:55,086 --> 00:06:56,815
my boss Scaly won't!

84
00:06:59,057 --> 00:07:02,117
Enjoying your food, huh?

85
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:04,789
Tiger!

86
00:07:44,102 --> 00:07:45,296
Where's the Plaque?

87
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:48,895
Who are you?

88
00:07:49,107 --> 00:07:50,574
Tiger Wong!

89
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:53,534
Find the Plaque...

90
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:55,144
or you can't leave!

91
00:08:09,194 --> 00:08:11,025
I'll take sole responsibility
for what I've done!

92
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:27,765
Go down!

93
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,930
Let him go!

94
00:10:39,711 --> 00:10:41,406
Why?

95
00:10:51,723 --> 00:10:55,352
Gosh! Scaly has gone way out of hand!

96
00:10:55,894 --> 00:10:58,658
All crap!

97
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:05,392
What you starin' at, Dragon Wong?

98
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,437
You wanna fight me one on one?

99
00:11:09,974 --> 00:11:11,134
Why you let that kid

100
00:11:11,342 --> 00:11:13,310
go just now, Kun?

101
00:11:13,511 --> 00:11:15,342
None of them were able to beat him.

102
00:11:15,547 --> 00:11:16,639
And the White Lions were watching.

103
00:11:16,848 --> 00:11:18,782
If Kun hadn't let him go...

104
00:11:18,983 --> 00:11:20,109
the two gangs
could have started fighting.

105
00:11:20,318 --> 00:11:21,615
What good would that do, you crazy dog?

106
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:22,786
Who cares about the White Lions?

107
00:11:22,987 --> 00:11:24,648
You're just a bodyguard.

108
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:26,289
I could have taken him out on my own!

109
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:28,721
I'm good!

110
00:11:29,027 --> 00:11:30,619
- Scaly...
- Come fight me one on one!

111
00:11:31,729 --> 00:11:32,991
Scram!

112
00:11:34,365 --> 00:11:35,798
You better watch out!

113
00:11:41,406 --> 00:11:42,737
Why didn't you

114
00:11:42,941 --> 00:11:44,499
go all the way...

115
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:46,404
when fighting the kid?

116
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,188
I will get you the Plaque back.

117
00:12:32,457 --> 00:12:34,516
Stop eating!
Look how heavy the plaque is!

118
00:12:34,726 --> 00:12:35,715
Why is the plaque with you?

119
00:12:35,927 --> 00:12:37,724
I snatched it when you were fighting.

120
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:39,123
Hey! Let me see! Look!

121
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,059
We can fence it for some dough!

122
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:42,255
Sure can!

123
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:44,765
We can donate the money for charity.

124
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:47,560
Charity? What a waste!

125
00:12:47,772 --> 00:12:49,137
So who's the boss today?

126
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,207
Tiger, of course!

127
00:12:52,443 --> 00:12:53,205
Hey you guys!

128
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:53,877
Me again?

129
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:55,170
Come! In sum...

130
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,508
Tiger is virtuous and generous.
He's perfect!

131
00:12:58,716 --> 00:13:01,344
Indeed! Cheers!

132
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:03,812
- Cheers! - Thanks!

133
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:07,623
Just dig in!

134
00:13:07,992 --> 00:13:09,892
Pass me the whole plate!

135
00:13:39,957 --> 00:13:42,721
The sushi today is so good! So delicious!

136
00:13:42,927 --> 00:13:44,827
Two more orders please!

137
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:46,257
Hurry up!

138
00:13:47,532 --> 00:13:49,090
Tiger is our boss today.

139
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,961
He'll start first.

140
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:53,763
Tiger, that's for you!

141
00:13:54,105 --> 00:13:57,131
And this is for me!

142
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,302
Gimme the Plaque.

143
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:02,506
The plaque?

144
00:14:03,548 --> 00:14:06,642
What plaque?

145
00:14:07,352 --> 00:14:08,512
This one?

146
00:14:08,986 --> 00:14:10,317
The plaque is your head!

147
00:14:11,556 --> 00:14:13,046
You want this?

148
00:14:13,257 --> 00:14:14,952
How much can you pay?

149
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:31,269
You weren't all that bad last time!

150
00:14:31,476 --> 00:14:32,670
Dragon!

151
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,373
You got lost or what?

152
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,172
I come here to give you a hand!

153
00:14:37,382 --> 00:14:38,906
I've put drugs in their wine!

154
00:14:39,117 --> 00:14:40,584
I already got the Plaque.

155
00:14:40,785 --> 00:14:42,480
I hate dirty tricks!

156
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,882
The plaque is ours.
They're having fun with it.

157
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:47,182
We got every right to beat them up.

158
00:14:47,658 --> 00:14:49,592
What did you say before? Me dirty?

159
00:14:49,794 --> 00:14:52,729
You dumbhead. Let me teach you a lesson!

160
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,158
Beat him up!

161
00:14:59,804 --> 00:15:01,795
You dare to touch me?

162
00:15:02,006 --> 00:15:03,371
Beat him up too!

163
00:15:06,077 --> 00:15:08,068
You guys will need
an ambulance real soon!

164
00:15:12,183 --> 00:15:14,777
I said beat him up!
Who you fightin' with?

165
00:16:27,925 --> 00:16:30,189
Dragon Wong!

166
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,255
Didn't you say you're a good fighter?

167
00:16:43,107 --> 00:16:44,506
Go in!

168
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:50,477
Beat the crap outta anyone you see!

169
00:17:35,126 --> 00:17:37,287
I hate to be disturbed at my meals.

170
00:18:33,517 --> 00:18:35,178
Your nunchaku sucks.

171
00:18:35,386 --> 00:18:37,013
Better practice more!

172
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,621
Let's practice together sometimes!

173
00:18:46,497 --> 00:18:47,429
Thanks for your help!

174
00:18:47,632 --> 00:18:50,567
You're welcome. Just couldn't stand them!

175
00:18:54,105 --> 00:18:55,231
I'm Turbo.

176
00:18:55,973 --> 00:18:56,962
Tiger.

177
00:18:57,174 --> 00:18:58,539
Tiger?

178
00:18:58,743 --> 00:19:01,268
A fierce name! Gotta split now!

179
00:19:05,983 --> 00:19:07,007
You guys okay?

180
00:19:07,218 --> 00:19:09,345
We're fine.

181
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:11,245
No blood was shed.

182
00:19:11,656 --> 00:19:15,023
Hey, is that yours? I just found it.

183
00:19:21,032 --> 00:19:22,693
Tiger!

184
00:19:23,934 --> 00:19:26,027
Where's Dragon Tiger Gate?

185
00:20:10,247 --> 00:20:11,680
Baldy, you snatched the plaque.

186
00:20:11,882 --> 00:20:14,180
You better explain
to the Master yourself.

187
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,158
Stop staring. You can touch it.

188
00:20:40,644 --> 00:20:43,738
I got this scar when I was a kid.

189
00:20:44,615 --> 00:20:46,082
When I was at your age,

190
00:20:46,283 --> 00:20:48,376
I already knew kungfu well.

191
00:20:48,652 --> 00:20:50,677
Once I passed by
someone wielding his sword.

192
00:20:50,888 --> 00:20:53,254
And there went this scar!

193
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,355
It's such a big golden plaque.

194
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,492
I had to snatch it.

195
00:20:57,695 --> 00:20:59,219
Then this long-haired guy
asked me for it.

196
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,294
Of course I wouldn't give it to him.

197
00:21:00,498 --> 00:21:01,556
So he beat us up.

198
00:21:01,766 --> 00:21:03,233
He punched me and I parried...

199
00:21:03,434 --> 00:21:04,924
like what you taught us.

200
00:21:05,136 --> 00:21:06,899
And the rest is history.

201
00:21:07,104 --> 00:21:08,935
We're really not to blame!

202
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,631
Indeed, Master! We're not to blame!

203
00:21:11,842 --> 00:21:14,709
The plaque you snatched
is called Lousha Plaque.

204
00:21:15,513 --> 00:21:16,946
It's the transaction permit

205
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:19,582
between Lousha Gang and Kun.

206
00:21:20,651 --> 00:21:23,620
Lousha Gang is a crime organization.

207
00:21:24,288 --> 00:21:27,451
You snatched their stuff...

208
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,524
and claimed you're innocent?

209
00:21:30,194 --> 00:21:32,685
Get out and squat for 3 hours!

210
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:39,168
Would someone gimme a hand? I can't see!

211
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,201
3 hours already!

212
00:21:49,113 --> 00:21:50,478
Uncle.

213
00:21:51,882 --> 00:21:53,474
I saw my brother again.

214
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:56,948
He's Kun's man now.

215
00:21:57,688 --> 00:22:00,020
So he's tied to Lousha Gang.

216
00:22:01,258 --> 00:22:03,055
But I don't believe he's a bad guy.

217
00:22:04,762 --> 00:22:06,423
Bring him back to the Gate.

218
00:22:07,865 --> 00:22:09,298
Master,

219
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:13,299
I'm Turbo from overseas.

220
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:16,530
I was invincible in Chinatown...

221
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,106
But I know...

222
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,972
you're well versed in martial arts.

223
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:23,168
I wanna aggregate

224
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,905
the skills of all schools...

225
00:22:26,116 --> 00:22:28,846
to manifest the spirits
of Chinese kungfu.

226
00:22:29,053 --> 00:22:30,953
I'd therefore like to be your disciple.

227
00:22:35,893 --> 00:22:38,088
I'll be your disciple no matter what!

228
00:22:47,638 --> 00:22:49,003
You still here?

229
00:22:49,406 --> 00:22:50,464
Wait!

230
00:22:50,774 --> 00:22:52,366
I ain't gonna give up!

231
00:22:53,911 --> 00:22:55,674
You're great in nunchaku.

232
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,713
Can you teach me?

233
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:02,112
I won't teach you.
But we can practice together.

234
00:23:03,053 --> 00:23:04,452
Great!

235
00:23:13,197 --> 00:23:14,858
Where's your nunchaku?

236
00:23:19,703 --> 00:23:21,762
By the way, I'm also called the Judo Kid!

237
00:23:21,972 --> 00:23:23,132
Come on!

238
00:23:28,913 --> 00:23:31,074
Wow, excellent footwork!

239
00:23:31,815 --> 00:23:34,147
By the way, how you got that scar?

240
00:23:34,618 --> 00:23:35,585
How you got that scar?

241
00:23:35,786 --> 00:23:36,684
I can't hear you.

242
00:23:36,887 --> 00:23:37,854
I said your scar...

243
00:23:41,091 --> 00:23:44,458
I got the scar while practicing.

244
00:23:45,195 --> 00:23:47,595
But the other guy is a limp now.

245
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:50,294
So be careful!

246
00:24:11,288 --> 00:24:13,882
Dragon, Come over!

247
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:25,094
It's for Dad's safety.

248
00:24:25,302 --> 00:24:26,462
Let's do it together.

249
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,399
Am I not good enough...

250
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:30,197
to protect you?

251
00:24:30,407 --> 00:24:32,136
Come fight me!

252
00:24:32,409 --> 00:24:36,812
No way! I don't wanna kill you!

253
00:24:37,548 --> 00:24:38,913
Then I'll die for sure

254
00:24:39,116 --> 00:24:40,811
Better rely on yourself than on gods.

255
00:24:41,018 --> 00:24:42,986
I won't let anything happen to you...

256
00:24:43,187 --> 00:24:45,018
or your dad.

257
00:24:47,024 --> 00:24:50,050
If Dad retired,

258
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,285
you wouldn't need to protect us.

259
00:24:52,496 --> 00:24:54,794
We'd all be safe then.

260
00:24:57,568 --> 00:24:59,729
Where would you go

261
00:24:59,937 --> 00:25:01,905
if you could retire?

262
00:25:06,677 --> 00:25:08,110
Take this one first.

263
00:25:08,312 --> 00:25:10,906
I'll go get another one.

264
00:25:25,662 --> 00:25:27,562
Mom, did Tiger's mom

265
00:25:27,765 --> 00:25:29,232
take Dad away from us?

266
00:25:29,433 --> 00:25:31,298
I hate them!

267
00:25:32,002 --> 00:25:33,799
You shouldn't hate

268
00:25:34,004 --> 00:25:36,063
any member of the Gate.

269
00:25:36,473 --> 00:25:37,565
Dad and I separated

270
00:25:37,775 --> 00:25:39,470
not because of them.

271
00:25:39,676 --> 00:25:42,042
It's my own decision.

272
00:25:43,313 --> 00:25:46,646
Dragon, come out! It's Tiger!

273
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,943
Go away! Don't come see me anymore!

274
00:25:49,153 --> 00:25:51,451
I don't wanna see anyone
from the Gate ever!

275
00:25:51,655 --> 00:25:53,714
Get lost!

276
00:26:08,872 --> 00:26:10,032
Why you crying?

277
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,969
I'll beat you till you smile!

278
00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:21,277
Stop! Stop!

279
00:26:28,926 --> 00:26:30,257
Stop him. Don't let him run away.

280
00:26:30,461 --> 00:26:31,450
Stop!

281
00:26:31,662 --> 00:26:34,028
Still running, smart ass?

282
00:26:34,498 --> 00:26:35,795
Wanna fight back?

283
00:26:36,467 --> 00:26:37,559
What you guys want?

284
00:26:37,768 --> 00:26:38,996
What?

285
00:26:39,203 --> 00:26:40,295
Beat him up!

286
00:26:44,141 --> 00:26:45,631
Take his slipper!

287
00:26:45,843 --> 00:26:48,038
Don't come back to this park again!

288
00:26:48,245 --> 00:26:50,042
Let's go!

289
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,259
Hurry up, Tiger!

290
00:27:05,629 --> 00:27:07,358
Okay. I'm coming!

291
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,403
Let me give you my slipper,

292
00:27:14,605 --> 00:27:17,039
or your mom will yell at you.

293
00:27:17,241 --> 00:27:19,300
What about your mom?

294
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,568
It won't be a problem.

295
00:27:20,777 --> 00:27:22,369
Thanks!

296
00:27:25,082 --> 00:27:27,778
You don't wanna know
why I was in a fight?

297
00:27:30,187 --> 00:27:33,122
'Cos I know Dragon is a man of justice.

298
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,880
Unless they're in the wrong,

299
00:27:35,192 --> 00:27:37,422
you wouldn't have picked a fight.

300
00:27:37,628 --> 00:27:39,357
They were bullying Tiger.

301
00:27:39,763 --> 00:27:43,199
So I fought with them.

302
00:27:54,611 --> 00:27:56,272
Carry this jade pendant with you.

303
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,142
You're a member of the Gate
wherever you go.

304
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,344
You'll make it big in the future.

305
00:28:02,753 --> 00:28:05,688
Remember you're Wong Fuhu's son.

306
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,724
Don't ever commit a crime.

307
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:10,649
Your life...

308
00:28:10,861 --> 00:28:13,489
will be fraught with frustrations.

309
00:28:13,864 --> 00:28:17,459
You will come back to the Gate
with your head up.

310
00:28:18,035 --> 00:28:19,935
Never give up

311
00:28:20,137 --> 00:28:22,196
however difficult life will become.

312
00:28:23,607 --> 00:28:25,541
What you meant by "make it big"?

313
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:27,670
You'll know when you grow up.

314
00:28:30,047 --> 00:28:31,480
Come!

315
00:28:34,484 --> 00:28:36,714
When will I make it big?

316
00:28:49,132 --> 00:28:51,123
Dragon, your mom

317
00:28:51,335 --> 00:28:53,326
hasn't come out yet!

318
00:28:54,571 --> 00:28:56,835
Mom never came out.

319
00:28:57,808 --> 00:28:59,708
She was never seen again.

320
00:29:01,044 --> 00:29:02,841
It's lucky

321
00:29:03,247 --> 00:29:05,044
I met Kun.

322
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,277
Out of gratitude,

323
00:29:10,454 --> 00:29:13,548
I've done reluctant things for him.

324
00:29:14,658 --> 00:29:16,990
I know I can't leave here...

325
00:29:17,594 --> 00:29:20,586
I'm ashamed to go back
to the Gate ever again.

326
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:36,041
Dragon!

327
00:29:48,058 --> 00:29:49,855
I'm your baby brother!

328
00:29:50,227 --> 00:29:52,422
I know. So what?

329
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:54,790
Am I supposed to hug you
with tears in my eyes?

330
00:29:54,998 --> 00:29:58,661
And you hug me and call me Bro?

331
00:30:02,172 --> 00:30:04,470
Uncle and I want you back to the Gate.

332
00:30:04,908 --> 00:30:07,172
Don't work for this bad guy Kun anymore!

333
00:30:11,081 --> 00:30:14,050
So you're a good guy and I'm a bad guy.

334
00:30:14,584 --> 00:30:15,608
Go back to the Gate

335
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:17,616
and play your good guy!

336
00:30:50,954 --> 00:30:52,319
Chan!

337
00:30:53,724 --> 00:30:55,123
I'm Tiger Wong.

338
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,927
You're no fun!

339
00:31:00,664 --> 00:31:02,325
You and Dragon are tight?

340
00:31:03,934 --> 00:31:07,097
He works for my dad.
I treat him like a brother.

341
00:31:07,304 --> 00:31:08,965
You're his baby brother?

342
00:31:09,606 --> 00:31:11,938
You don't look alike.

343
00:31:14,111 --> 00:31:15,874
You guys are brothers.

344
00:31:16,246 --> 00:31:18,407
Why you act like that?

345
00:31:23,453 --> 00:31:25,080
That's why I wanna help him.

346
00:31:27,691 --> 00:31:30,922
Good! Gimme your phone.

347
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,213
Listen. Hurry up!

348
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:55,517
- Hello. - Hello.

349
00:32:00,056 --> 00:32:03,116
This is my number. Remember to call me!

350
00:32:05,996 --> 00:32:08,794
Aren't you gonna help me?

351
00:32:09,466 --> 00:32:12,799
Sure, but I didn't say now.

352
00:32:13,503 --> 00:32:16,131
I'll call you when I find him. Bye.

353
00:32:42,065 --> 00:32:45,228
Thanks for taking care
of Scaly and his dogs.

354
00:32:45,435 --> 00:32:47,426
They've been nothing but trouble lately.

355
00:32:47,904 --> 00:32:49,565
You can always quit.

356
00:32:49,973 --> 00:32:51,565
Not so simple!

357
00:32:53,343 --> 00:32:56,710
What's so hard?

358
00:32:59,216 --> 00:33:01,116
I've been in this biz forever.

359
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:04,213
Xiaoling is my only worry.

360
00:33:05,355 --> 00:33:09,348
I've taken you for my dad,

361
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,885
and Xiaoling my sis.

362
00:33:16,066 --> 00:33:19,092
I won't let anything
bad happen to my folks.

363
00:33:21,004 --> 00:33:23,131
I believe you.

364
00:33:23,406 --> 00:33:25,033
Just sleep on it.

365
00:33:26,343 --> 00:33:30,006
And you? Will you go back to the Gate?

366
00:33:30,347 --> 00:33:31,905
Yes,

367
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:34,043
but it's not the right time yet.

368
00:33:34,251 --> 00:33:35,878
I'll wait till you've retired.

369
00:33:36,086 --> 00:33:37,883
Wanna get rid of me?

370
00:33:41,191 --> 00:33:44,786
Yes. Give the Plaque back to Lousha Gang.

371
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:26,394
Nunchaku Slippers! Watch out!

372
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,901
You should be practicing!

373
00:34:36,646 --> 00:34:38,546
Playing with slippers?

374
00:34:38,748 --> 00:34:41,581
No more slippers for a month.

375
00:34:41,785 --> 00:34:43,275
Take them all off!

376
00:34:59,102 --> 00:35:03,163
You don't wanna teach me.

377
00:35:04,474 --> 00:35:06,101
At least practice with me!

378
00:35:08,979 --> 00:35:11,004
You're best at nunchaku?

379
00:35:11,881 --> 00:35:13,212
Yes.

380
00:35:13,683 --> 00:35:16,743
Please pick a weapon, Master!

381
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:48,579
You're clueless.

382
00:35:49,386 --> 00:35:52,116
Worse than the kids.

383
00:35:52,922 --> 00:35:55,550
You know nothing about nunchaku.

384
00:35:55,925 --> 00:35:57,415
Come back when you know...

385
00:35:57,627 --> 00:36:00,755
how to grasp a nunchaku.

386
00:36:33,663 --> 00:36:34,891
I'm Turbo,

387
00:36:35,098 --> 00:36:37,828
invincible in Chinatown.

388
00:36:40,537 --> 00:36:42,528
You're clueless.

389
00:36:43,473 --> 00:36:45,805
You know nothing nunchaku.

390
00:36:46,443 --> 00:36:48,001
Come back when you know...

391
00:36:48,211 --> 00:36:51,669
how to grasp a nunchaku.

392
00:37:14,771 --> 00:37:17,831
I was always bullied as I grew up abroad.

393
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:20,300
I didn't like that.

394
00:37:21,077 --> 00:37:23,307
So I slashed a scar on my face.

395
00:37:24,781 --> 00:37:27,045
I wanna scare people off.

396
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:30,645
I learnt nunchaku

397
00:37:31,254 --> 00:37:33,779
'cos it's fierce and powerful.

398
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:37,924
But today I was totally beaten.

399
00:37:39,662 --> 00:37:42,324
I thought I had grasped it very hard...

400
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:45,724
but he took it from me so easily!

401
00:37:48,104 --> 00:37:49,833
After a long struggle,

402
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,535
I finally realized...

403
00:37:53,643 --> 00:37:57,841
it's not a matter of strength...

404
00:37:59,149 --> 00:38:01,140
but of the heart.

405
00:38:02,819 --> 00:38:04,912
I can't scare people...

406
00:38:05,288 --> 00:38:07,779
with a scar on my face.

407
00:38:11,127 --> 00:38:13,789
I won't tell my scar story anymore.

408
00:38:15,865 --> 00:38:18,060
But I'll say...

409
00:38:19,002 --> 00:38:22,631
Master Wong left
a slipper mark on my face.

410
00:38:27,243 --> 00:38:28,938
I will keep it up.

411
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,480
Thanks!

412
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,352
Turbo!

413
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:54,669
You know how to do household chores?

414
00:38:54,871 --> 00:38:58,272
I don't, but I will learn!

415
00:39:13,456 --> 00:39:16,516
Kun wants to return
the Plaque and retire?

416
00:39:16,726 --> 00:39:19,627
That's good news for you.

417
00:39:25,635 --> 00:39:28,069
I'll arrange for you to join Lousha Gang.

418
00:39:28,972 --> 00:39:32,931
That way... we can be together.

419
00:39:38,748 --> 00:39:40,841
Why you staring at me?

420
00:39:41,885 --> 00:39:43,443
I want you to understand...

421
00:39:43,653 --> 00:39:46,713
I can make Shibumi
let you take Kun's place.

422
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:50,856
You can be your own boss finally!

423
00:39:52,061 --> 00:39:54,529
I shouldn't have rescued you that day.

424
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:17,950
Listen up, Dragon!

425
00:40:18,154 --> 00:40:20,315
Whether you join the Gang or not,

426
00:40:22,225 --> 00:40:26,093
we ain't good guys.

427
00:40:45,381 --> 00:40:49,408
We cannot change our fate.

428
00:41:09,605 --> 00:41:11,436
- Dragon, I... - Xiaoling.

429
00:41:12,108 --> 00:41:13,598
You know Tiger?

430
00:41:13,977 --> 00:41:15,274
Yeah.

431
00:41:15,645 --> 00:41:16,942
Arrange a meeting for us,

432
00:41:17,947 --> 00:41:19,175
please.

433
00:41:43,373 --> 00:41:45,273
You know where we are?

434
00:41:47,377 --> 00:41:49,845
You won't recall. You were just a kid.

435
00:41:50,213 --> 00:41:51,441
It used to be a park.

436
00:41:51,647 --> 00:41:54,241
And there was a monkey bar here.

437
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,674
After we were beaten,

438
00:41:55,885 --> 00:41:57,546
you liked to hide here.

439
00:41:58,955 --> 00:42:01,480
I'll learn my kungfu well.
I'll beat them up!

440
00:42:01,724 --> 00:42:05,023
Kungfu is for protecting people,

441
00:42:05,228 --> 00:42:07,560
not for fighting.

442
00:42:08,131 --> 00:42:09,792
We will never be bad guys

443
00:42:09,999 --> 00:42:10,931
no matter what.

444
00:42:11,134 --> 00:42:12,328
Got it?

445
00:42:12,535 --> 00:42:13,797
Got it.

446
00:42:14,771 --> 00:42:18,502
Look! That's the direction
to the Dragon Tiger Gate.

447
00:42:20,743 --> 00:42:23,177
Ever beaten anyone you shouldn't have?

448
00:42:24,414 --> 00:42:27,178
No! Never!

449
00:42:28,818 --> 00:42:32,413
But I have. Many times!

450
00:42:33,823 --> 00:42:35,154
Many things

451
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:37,588
have happened to me,

452
00:42:39,028 --> 00:42:41,758
but you won't understand.

453
00:42:43,132 --> 00:42:46,033
I wanna tell you today...

454
00:42:47,103 --> 00:42:49,003
I'm proud of you.

455
00:42:49,505 --> 00:42:52,099
'Cos you can stick to your principles!

456
00:42:52,308 --> 00:42:53,969
I also have my principles.

457
00:42:54,844 --> 00:42:56,937
I know where I should go.

458
00:43:02,085 --> 00:43:03,484
Let's go.

459
00:43:06,055 --> 00:43:07,215
Hey!

460
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:08,752
I'll wait for you at home!

461
00:43:08,958 --> 00:43:11,984
Cool. See you at the Gate!

462
00:43:21,404 --> 00:43:24,430
Giving up the Plague is an insult to me!

463
00:43:25,508 --> 00:43:26,873
Rosa.

464
00:43:27,076 --> 00:43:30,068
Both Kun and Dragon must die!

465
00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:32,110
Watch out!

466
00:43:32,448 --> 00:43:34,780
Xiaoling, show us what you got!

467
00:43:34,984 --> 00:43:37,350
Do your best, Xiaoling!

468
00:43:53,803 --> 00:43:56,237
Dad, how did I do?

469
00:43:56,739 --> 00:43:57,865
Not too bad.

470
00:43:59,008 --> 00:44:00,805
I'm the best

471
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:03,001
in the team.

472
00:44:03,212 --> 00:44:04,736
And you call that "not too bad"?!

473
00:44:04,947 --> 00:44:08,110
I was the best softball player once.

474
00:44:08,317 --> 00:44:11,753
Your game is just kiddy stuff for me!

475
00:44:12,155 --> 00:44:13,349
Cool!

476
00:44:13,556 --> 00:44:16,116
If you're so good, let's play a game!

477
00:44:16,325 --> 00:44:17,792
Okay, you arrange it.

478
00:44:17,994 --> 00:44:20,861
But you better get changed now.
We'll go eat.

479
00:44:21,063 --> 00:44:22,030
Dragon is on his way.

480
00:44:22,231 --> 00:44:23,425
Cool!

481
00:44:28,137 --> 00:44:29,035
Hello.

482
00:44:29,238 --> 00:44:31,604
Dragon, I have to see you now.

483
00:44:31,941 --> 00:44:33,431
But I don't feel like it.

484
00:44:35,311 --> 00:44:37,108
You'll regret if you don't show up.

485
00:45:01,571 --> 00:45:05,530
So fast! You must miss me!

486
00:45:15,318 --> 00:45:18,651
Have you ever done it in the water?

487
00:45:23,459 --> 00:45:24,153
I thought you had

488
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,521
something urgent to tell me.

489
00:45:36,973 --> 00:45:38,531
Tattoo for me.

490
00:45:40,343 --> 00:45:42,368
Why?

491
00:45:43,913 --> 00:45:47,110
My birthday present.

492
00:45:48,551 --> 00:45:50,644
You have birthday?

493
00:45:51,354 --> 00:45:54,380
You saved me years ago.

494
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:56,990
To me, that's my birthday.

495
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:08,626
Forget it. I know you won't.

496
00:46:15,044 --> 00:46:16,477
Turn around.

497
00:46:38,634 --> 00:46:40,158
Go away!

498
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:42,365
You'll fall to your death!

499
00:46:42,571 --> 00:46:44,664
None of your business. Go way!

500
00:46:44,874 --> 00:46:47,672
Jump down and I'll catch you.

501
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,287
What's your name?

502
00:46:58,487 --> 00:46:59,954
Dragon.

503
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:01,849
Yours?

504
00:47:02,058 --> 00:47:03,457
Rosa.

505
00:47:07,396 --> 00:47:08,385
What you staring at?

506
00:47:08,597 --> 00:47:10,030
Can't I stare?

507
00:47:14,837 --> 00:47:16,862
I'll be in love with you forever.

508
00:47:27,249 --> 00:47:29,183
What have you tattooed for me?

509
00:47:52,408 --> 00:47:54,968
I've always wanted to
stare at you like that.

510
00:48:02,118 --> 00:48:03,710
I was supposed to kill you.

511
00:48:03,986 --> 00:48:05,681
Double Devils are off to kill Kun.

512
00:48:05,955 --> 00:48:07,820
It's too late.

513
00:50:10,012 --> 00:50:10,979
Go to hell!

514
00:50:14,817 --> 00:50:16,216
You bloody old man!

515
00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:19,613
I'm good but you treat me like shit!

516
00:50:19,822 --> 00:50:21,915
Better to work for
Lousha Gang than for you.

517
00:50:22,791 --> 00:50:26,124
Retire? Not so easy!

518
00:50:26,328 --> 00:50:27,955
Let me retire you now!

519
00:50:29,865 --> 00:50:31,594
Don't hit me, Kun!

520
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,701
I was just kiddin'!

521
00:50:34,904 --> 00:50:37,372
- You back-stabbing asshole!
- Let me retire with you.

522
00:50:40,676 --> 00:50:42,803
Help! Double Devils!

523
00:50:43,012 --> 00:50:45,742
Help!

524
00:51:07,403 --> 00:51:08,802
Dad!

525
00:55:20,389 --> 00:55:22,289
Watch over her!

526
00:57:01,556 --> 00:57:04,491
Remember you're Wong Fuhu's son.

527
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,294
You'll make it big in the future.

528
00:57:07,729 --> 00:57:10,664
You will come back to the Gate
with your head up.

529
00:57:10,999 --> 00:57:12,660
Never give up...

530
00:57:12,868 --> 00:57:14,995
however difficult life will become.

531
00:58:36,918 --> 00:58:38,647
My dad...

532
00:58:39,221 --> 00:58:41,212
Will he go to heaven?

533
00:58:43,592 --> 00:58:47,619
He will. He loved you so much.

534
00:58:53,902 --> 00:58:57,804
Better ask when the bad guys
will go to hell!

535
00:59:02,377 --> 00:59:04,709
From now on, the Gate is your home.

536
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:08,014
Even if my limps are broken,

537
00:59:08,316 --> 00:59:10,477
I won't let anyone harm you.

538
00:59:50,125 --> 00:59:54,061
Double Devils were beaten
by people from the Gate.

539
00:59:58,066 --> 01:00:00,261
The Gate is really that strong?

540
01:00:00,902 --> 01:00:02,529
Good!

541
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,508
Master,

542
01:00:15,317 --> 01:00:16,215
we haven't found Tiger yet.

543
01:00:16,418 --> 01:00:18,181
Baldy and others are searching for him!

544
01:00:29,397 --> 01:00:31,160
Who's the best here?

545
01:01:27,856 --> 01:01:29,153
Watch out for...

546
01:01:30,058 --> 01:01:31,355
the "Black Pagoda"!

547
01:02:56,311 --> 01:03:00,372
So Dragon Tiger Gate's kungfu sucks!

548
01:03:38,153 --> 01:03:40,781
You're not good enough
to die under my hands!

549
01:03:57,505 --> 01:03:58,972
But you can!

550
01:04:14,656 --> 01:04:16,624
Find your brother.

551
01:04:16,825 --> 01:04:20,352
Guard the Gate together...

552
01:04:53,762 --> 01:04:56,959
Xiaoling, should anything
happen to anyone...

553
01:04:57,165 --> 01:04:58,689
bring them to Mt Baiyun...

554
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,868
and look for a guy called Qi.

555
01:06:50,378 --> 01:06:51,777
Master!

556
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:58,646
Master! Master...

557
01:06:58,853 --> 01:07:01,344
Please save my friends!

558
01:07:03,324 --> 01:07:07,385
Their wounds are too deep for me.

559
01:07:08,263 --> 01:07:10,026
All over Mt Baiyun,

560
01:07:10,231 --> 01:07:13,826
Only Qi can help them.

561
01:07:14,736 --> 01:07:16,533
Where can I find Qi?

562
01:07:17,705 --> 01:07:19,696
Inside the pagoda.

563
01:07:20,975 --> 01:07:23,136
I'll find him once I get up there?

564
01:07:23,344 --> 01:07:26,404
No one has ever entered the pagoda!

565
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,251
Stay put!

566
01:07:33,521 --> 01:07:35,489
Pick up the prayer beads.

567
01:07:51,072 --> 01:07:53,666
Pick up all the prayer beads.

568
01:08:51,933 --> 01:08:53,491
Master Qi

569
01:09:18,326 --> 01:09:20,317
Here are all the prayer beads.

570
01:09:20,528 --> 01:09:22,792
Please save my friends.

571
01:09:23,097 --> 01:09:25,497
There's still one bead below the pagoda.

572
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:31,195
You've gone an arduous way.

573
01:09:31,406 --> 01:09:34,034
Your friends must mean a lot to you.

574
01:09:34,475 --> 01:09:36,739
If you can jump down the pagoda...

575
01:09:36,944 --> 01:09:39,845
to pick up the bead...

576
01:09:40,815 --> 01:09:42,680
then I will save them.

577
01:09:58,366 --> 01:10:00,561
I hope you'll keep your promise.

578
01:10:13,114 --> 01:10:15,412
Did I ever go up there?

579
01:10:17,151 --> 01:10:19,745
Everything is an illusion
in the mundane world.

580
01:10:19,954 --> 01:10:22,821
Only your conviction is real.

581
01:10:23,791 --> 01:10:26,783
The moment you decided
to sacrifice yourself...

582
01:10:27,128 --> 01:10:29,756
the prayer bead was already in your hand.

583
01:10:34,869 --> 01:10:37,929
Don't worry. I will save your friends.

584
01:10:41,542 --> 01:10:45,205
No one at the Gate is good enough
to beat Double Devils.

585
01:10:45,413 --> 01:10:49,144
I know your relationship with Dragon.

586
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:50,578
He's good.

587
01:10:50,785 --> 01:10:52,480
I wanna fight with him.

588
01:10:53,121 --> 01:10:54,486
Take this to save him.

589
01:10:54,689 --> 01:10:57,283
He should die under my hands.

590
01:11:23,818 --> 01:11:27,618
You'll be okay after the acupuncture.

591
01:11:30,258 --> 01:11:34,126
Your internal power might even increase.

592
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:47,236
Don't move.

593
01:11:48,176 --> 01:11:49,905
Don't say a word.

594
01:11:56,551 --> 01:11:58,712
I was also adopted.

595
01:11:59,754 --> 01:12:02,222
No one ever cares how I feel.

596
01:12:03,424 --> 01:12:05,892
I did this for you today,

597
01:12:06,127 --> 01:12:07,992
so you'll care for me.

598
01:12:10,565 --> 01:12:12,965
Even if you don't love me,

599
01:12:14,735 --> 01:12:17,067
I can make you hate me!

600
01:12:42,396 --> 01:12:44,660
This pill can only save one person.

601
01:12:44,899 --> 01:12:46,389
You can either save Dragon...

602
01:12:46,667 --> 01:12:48,726
or yourself!

603
01:13:14,161 --> 01:13:15,719
Dragon,

604
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,561
have you ever loved me?

605
01:15:14,515 --> 01:15:18,144
Tiger, I'll teach you
"Electric Dragon Drill."

606
01:15:20,621 --> 01:15:23,317
Turbo, I'll teach you "Golden Mask."

607
01:16:36,497 --> 01:16:39,057
Tiger, Turbo,

608
01:16:39,266 --> 01:16:41,598
I'm giving you two gadgets.

609
01:16:41,802 --> 01:16:44,737
They can help you fight Shibumi.

610
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:46,768
But whether you'll win in the end

611
01:16:46,974 --> 01:16:48,999
depends on yourselves.

612
01:17:20,508 --> 01:17:21,975
Wait for me at the Gate.

613
01:17:25,446 --> 01:17:27,038
I promise I'll be back.

614
01:18:57,738 --> 01:18:59,330
Looking for your own death?

615
01:19:41,448 --> 01:19:43,143
Your kungfu has improved a lot!

616
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:53,585
Let's have a good fight!

617
01:21:01,929 --> 01:21:03,328
That's it?

618
01:21:05,532 --> 01:21:07,295
Anything more?

619
01:22:12,065 --> 01:22:13,794
Your "Golden Mask" is not bad!

620
01:22:41,662 --> 01:22:42,993
Anything else?

621
01:23:16,563 --> 01:23:20,294
Electric Dragon Drill! Embarrassing!

622
01:23:32,946 --> 01:23:35,744
On behalf of the Gate,
I'm returning the Plaque to you.

623
01:23:37,718 --> 01:23:40,278
Dragon, I've been waiting for you!

624
01:24:54,194 --> 01:24:55,525
Eighteen Dragon Slaying Palms?

625
01:25:09,876 --> 01:25:12,811
That's all you have, Shibumi? How slow!

626
01:28:44,257 --> 01:28:46,657
We can go back to the Gate now,

627
01:28:48,428 --> 01:28:49,918
Little Bro!

628
01:29:37,944 --> 01:29:38,911
Tiger!

629
01:29:39,279 --> 01:29:40,303
Tiger is back!

630
01:29:40,513 --> 01:29:41,172
Tiger!

631
01:29:41,381 --> 01:29:42,405
Tiger!

632
01:29:43,116 --> 01:29:44,515
Tiger!

633
01:29:51,558 --> 01:29:54,823
Uncle, we're back, my brother and me.

634
01:30:04,938 --> 01:30:06,872
Uncle said the Gate...

635
01:30:07,073 --> 01:30:09,234
should be passed on to both of us.

636
01:30:10,243 --> 01:30:12,211
Yo, what about me?

637
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:14,410
Ever think about changing

638
01:30:14,614 --> 01:30:16,275
your name to Leopard?

639
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:19,912
Turbo Leopard? Sounds fierce!
