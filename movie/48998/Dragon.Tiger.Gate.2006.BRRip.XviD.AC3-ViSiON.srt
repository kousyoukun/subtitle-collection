1
00:01:07,532 --> 00:01:10,262
Dragon Tiger Gate was founded...

2
00:01:10,468 --> 00:01:12,231
by 2 kungfu masters:

3
00:01:12,436 --> 00:01:14,870
Wong Jianglong and Wong Fuhu.

4
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:18,366
They promoted self-strengthening...

5
00:01:18,943 --> 00:01:21,434
to free people from oppression.

6
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,608
They even taught martial arts...

7
00:01:23,814 --> 00:01:26,783
to street urchins.

8
00:01:27,585 --> 00:01:30,577
The Gate thus became
the symbol of Justice.

9
00:01:31,022 --> 00:01:34,480
While every youth
was eager to join the Gate...

10
00:01:34,825 --> 00:01:37,794
Wong Fuhu's son,

11
00:01:37,995 --> 00:01:39,826
Dragon,

12
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:42,158
decided to leave.

13
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:44,325
He was to part

14
00:01:44,535 --> 00:01:46,366
with his baby brother,

15
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:48,300
Tiger.

16
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:29,311
Shibumi

17
00:02:31,215 --> 00:02:35,151
Rosa, Ma Kun's been doing a good job.

18
00:02:35,353 --> 00:02:37,787
I decide to continue our collaboration.

19
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:39,957
Give him the Lousha Plaque.

20
00:02:40,157 --> 00:02:43,092
Ask him to keep up his work!

21
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:48,259
Remember, the Plaque
represents Lousha Gang.

22
00:02:54,338 --> 00:02:56,329
I've given you the Lousha Plaque.

23
00:02:56,774 --> 00:02:57,638
Don't let anything

24
00:02:57,842 --> 00:02:59,810
happen to it.

25
00:03:02,313 --> 00:03:05,043
I know. I'll do my best.

26
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:19,319
What a coincidence!

27
00:03:19,964 --> 00:03:21,329
Still remember me?

28
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:25,393
- Xiao... - That's right!

29
00:03:25,803 --> 00:03:27,464
So you still remember me!

30
00:03:29,073 --> 00:03:31,974
Grade 5?

31
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,774
Not Grade 5! Grade 3!

32
00:03:36,981 --> 00:03:38,380
Almost the same.

33
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:43,715
Not at all. What a poor memory!

34
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:46,649
Remember the fatso in our class?

35
00:03:46,857 --> 00:03:49,348
Sure, the one who bawled all the time?

36
00:03:50,161 --> 00:03:53,653
No, the one who wetted his pants!

37
00:03:54,965 --> 00:03:57,126
Well, he bawled after
he wetted his pants!

38
00:03:57,435 --> 00:03:59,835
I remember he liked pulling your plait!

39
00:04:00,204 --> 00:04:03,696
It couldn't be! I had short hair then.

40
00:04:07,044 --> 00:04:08,978
I remember you had long hair!

41
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:12,447
How can I forget I had short hair?

42
00:04:12,983 --> 00:04:15,918
Like, would you forget
you're called Chan?

43
00:04:19,557 --> 00:04:20,785
Look who has a poor memory?

44
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:23,585
I'm not Chan, Xiaowei!

45
00:04:32,203 --> 00:04:34,467
I'm not Xiaowei!

46
00:04:40,144 --> 00:04:41,907
- I'm sorry! - I'm sorry!

47
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,581
So what's your name?

48
00:04:52,623 --> 00:04:53,851
Tiger Wong.

49
00:04:54,158 --> 00:04:55,489
I'm Ma Xiaoling.

50
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:20,214
- Hey - Hey, Tiger!

51
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:21,282
Why so many people?

52
00:05:21,485 --> 00:05:24,045
Ma Kun has reserved...

53
00:05:24,255 --> 00:05:25,415
the whole upper floor.

54
00:05:25,623 --> 00:05:26,681
Ma Kun?

55
00:05:26,957 --> 00:05:29,084
The biggest kingpin in Hong Kong.

56
00:05:29,293 --> 00:05:32,524
Those dudes in black are his dogs.

57
00:05:38,936 --> 00:05:41,063
Some dudes in white are barging in!

58
00:05:43,574 --> 00:05:46,737
They're the White Lions.
As powerful as Kun!

59
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:48,241
Black or white,

60
00:05:48,446 --> 00:05:50,141
they're still bad guys!

61
00:05:53,584 --> 00:05:56,109
Kun, so you got the Plaque again.

62
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,284
You have monopoly
over all smuggling gigs.

63
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,388
It takes juice to work with Lousha Gang.

64
00:06:03,594 --> 00:06:06,529
You gotta work harder!

65
00:06:07,298 --> 00:06:09,459
Juice? I got much more than you!

66
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:10,998
To hell with your gigs.

67
00:06:11,202 --> 00:06:13,033
I want half of your cut!

68
00:06:13,237 --> 00:06:14,966
You kiddin' or what?

69
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:16,173
Whoever has the Plaque

70
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:18,705
can get all the cut.

71
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:22,106
You want half? You outta your mind?

72
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:28,315
Nice food! It's pay-up time!

73
00:06:30,054 --> 00:06:30,611
Mom!

74
00:06:30,821 --> 00:06:32,686
How dare you welsh

75
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:33,686
on our debts?

76
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:34,949
Not that I don't wanna pay.
We're the victims!

77
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,626
We've paid a lot already!

78
00:06:37,261 --> 00:06:39,786
Let them be. They are Kun's dogs!

79
00:06:40,331 --> 00:06:43,528
Stay put! Master won't like it!

80
00:06:46,003 --> 00:06:48,403
Shibumi gave me the Plaque.

81
00:06:49,807 --> 00:06:51,798
Come get it if you dare!

82
00:07:01,485 --> 00:07:02,474
Even if I let you go,

83
00:07:02,686 --> 00:07:04,415
my boss Scaly won't!

84
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:09,717
Enjoying your food, huh?

85
00:07:11,195 --> 00:07:12,389
Tiger!

86
00:07:51,702 --> 00:07:52,896
Where's the Plaque?

87
00:07:55,506 --> 00:07:56,495
Who are you?

88
00:07:56,707 --> 00:07:58,174
Tiger Wong!

89
00:07:59,143 --> 00:08:01,134
Find the Plaque...

90
00:08:01,345 --> 00:08:02,744
or you can't leave!

91
00:08:16,794 --> 00:08:18,625
I'll take sole responsibility
for what I've done!

92
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:35,365
Go down!

93
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,530
Let him go!

94
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:49,006
Why?

95
00:10:59,323 --> 00:11:02,952
Gosh! Scaly has gone way out of hand!

96
00:11:03,494 --> 00:11:06,258
All crap!

97
00:11:11,502 --> 00:11:12,992
What you starin' at, Dragon Wong?

98
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,037
You wanna fight me one on one?

99
00:11:17,574 --> 00:11:18,734
Why you let that kid

100
00:11:18,942 --> 00:11:20,910
go just now, Kun?

101
00:11:21,111 --> 00:11:22,942
None of them were able to beat him.

102
00:11:23,147 --> 00:11:24,239
And the White Lions were watching.

103
00:11:24,448 --> 00:11:26,382
If Kun hadn't let him go...

104
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:27,709
the two gangs
could have started fighting.

105
00:11:27,918 --> 00:11:29,215
What good would that do, you crazy dog?

106
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:30,386
Who cares about the White Lions?

107
00:11:30,587 --> 00:11:32,248
You're just a bodyguard.

108
00:11:32,456 --> 00:11:33,889
I could have taken him out on my own!

109
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:36,321
I'm good!

110
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:38,219
- Scaly...
- Come fight me one on one!

111
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:40,591
Scram!

112
00:11:41,965 --> 00:11:43,398
You better watch out!

113
00:11:49,006 --> 00:11:50,337
Why didn't you

114
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,099
go all the way...

115
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:54,004
when fighting the kid?

116
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,788
I will get you the Plaque back.

117
00:12:40,057 --> 00:12:42,116
Stop eating!
Look how heavy the plaque is!

118
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:43,315
Why is the plaque with you?

119
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:45,324
I snatched it when you were fighting.

120
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:46,723
Hey! Let me see! Look!

121
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,659
We can fence it for some dough!

122
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:49,855
Sure can!

123
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:52,365
We can donate the money for charity.

124
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:55,160
Charity? What a waste!

125
00:12:55,372 --> 00:12:56,737
So who's the boss today?

126
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,807
Tiger, of course!

127
00:13:00,043 --> 00:13:00,805
Hey you guys!

128
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:01,477
Me again?

129
00:13:01,678 --> 00:13:02,770
Come! In sum...

130
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,108
Tiger is virtuous and generous.
He's perfect!

131
00:13:06,316 --> 00:13:08,944
Indeed! Cheers!

132
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:11,412
- Cheers! - Thanks!

133
00:13:13,824 --> 00:13:15,223
Just dig in!

134
00:13:15,592 --> 00:13:17,492
Pass me the whole plate!

135
00:13:47,557 --> 00:13:50,321
The sushi today is so good! So delicious!

136
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:52,427
Two more orders please!

137
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:53,857
Hurry up!

138
00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:56,690
Tiger is our boss today.

139
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,561
He'll start first.

140
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:01,363
Tiger, that's for you!

141
00:14:01,705 --> 00:14:04,731
And this is for me!

142
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,902
Gimme the Plaque.

143
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:10,106
The plaque?

144
00:14:11,148 --> 00:14:14,242
What plaque?

145
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:16,112
This one?

146
00:14:16,586 --> 00:14:17,917
The plaque is your head!

147
00:14:19,156 --> 00:14:20,646
You want this?

148
00:14:20,857 --> 00:14:22,552
How much can you pay?

149
00:14:37,607 --> 00:14:38,869
You weren't all that bad last time!

150
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:40,270
Dragon!

151
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:42,973
You got lost or what?

152
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,772
I come here to give you a hand!

153
00:14:44,982 --> 00:14:46,506
I've put drugs in their wine!

154
00:14:46,717 --> 00:14:48,184
I already got the Plaque.

155
00:14:48,385 --> 00:14:50,080
I hate dirty tricks!

156
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:52,482
The plaque is ours.
They're having fun with it.

157
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:54,782
We got every right to beat them up.

158
00:14:55,258 --> 00:14:57,192
What did you say before? Me dirty?

159
00:14:57,394 --> 00:15:00,329
You dumbhead. Let me teach you a lesson!

160
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,758
Beat him up!

161
00:15:07,404 --> 00:15:09,395
You dare to touch me?

162
00:15:09,606 --> 00:15:10,971
Beat him up too!

163
00:15:13,677 --> 00:15:15,668
You guys will need
an ambulance real soon!

164
00:15:19,783 --> 00:15:22,377
I said beat him up!
Who you fightin' with?

165
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:37,789
Dragon Wong!

166
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,855
Didn't you say you're a good fighter?

167
00:16:50,707 --> 00:16:52,106
Go in!

168
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:58,077
Beat the crap outta anyone you see!

169
00:17:42,726 --> 00:17:44,887
I hate to be disturbed at my meals.

170
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:42,778
Your nunchaku sucks.

171
00:18:42,986 --> 00:18:44,613
Better practice more!

172
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,221
Let's practice together sometimes!

173
00:18:54,097 --> 00:18:55,029
Thanks for your help!

174
00:18:55,232 --> 00:18:58,167
You're welcome. Just couldn't stand them!

175
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:02,831
I'm Turbo.

176
00:19:03,573 --> 00:19:04,562
Tiger.

177
00:19:04,774 --> 00:19:06,139
Tiger?

178
00:19:06,343 --> 00:19:08,868
A fierce name! Gotta split now!

179
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,607
You guys okay?

180
00:19:14,818 --> 00:19:16,945
We're fine.

181
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:18,845
No blood was shed.

182
00:19:19,256 --> 00:19:22,623
Hey, is that yours? I just found it.

183
00:19:28,632 --> 00:19:30,293
Tiger!

184
00:19:31,534 --> 00:19:33,627
Where's Dragon Tiger Gate?

185
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:19,280
Baldy, you snatched the plaque.

186
00:20:19,482 --> 00:20:21,780
You better explain
to the Master yourself.

187
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,758
Stop staring. You can touch it.

188
00:20:48,244 --> 00:20:51,338
I got this scar when I was a kid.

189
00:20:52,215 --> 00:20:53,682
When I was at your age,

190
00:20:53,883 --> 00:20:55,976
I already knew kungfu well.

191
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:58,277
Once I passed by
someone wielding his sword.

192
00:20:58,488 --> 00:21:00,854
And there went this scar!

193
00:21:01,725 --> 00:21:03,955
It's such a big golden plaque.

194
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,092
I had to snatch it.

195
00:21:05,295 --> 00:21:06,819
Then this long-haired guy
asked me for it.

196
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:07,894
Of course I wouldn't give it to him.

197
00:21:08,098 --> 00:21:09,156
So he beat us up.

198
00:21:09,366 --> 00:21:10,833
He punched me and I parried...

199
00:21:11,034 --> 00:21:12,524
like what you taught us.

200
00:21:12,736 --> 00:21:14,499
And the rest is history.

201
00:21:14,704 --> 00:21:16,535
We're really not to blame!

202
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,231
Indeed, Master! We're not to blame!

203
00:21:19,442 --> 00:21:22,309
The plaque you snatched
is called Lousha Plaque.

204
00:21:23,113 --> 00:21:24,546
It's the transaction permit

205
00:21:24,748 --> 00:21:27,182
between Lousha Gang and Kun.

206
00:21:28,251 --> 00:21:31,220
Lousha Gang is a crime organization.

207
00:21:31,888 --> 00:21:35,051
You snatched their stuff...

208
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:37,124
and claimed you're innocent?

209
00:21:37,794 --> 00:21:40,285
Get out and squat for 3 hours!

210
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,768
Would someone gimme a hand? I can't see!

211
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,801
3 hours already!

212
00:21:56,713 --> 00:21:58,078
Uncle.

213
00:21:59,482 --> 00:22:01,074
I saw my brother again.

214
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:04,548
He's Kun's man now.

215
00:22:05,288 --> 00:22:07,620
So he's tied to Lousha Gang.

216
00:22:08,858 --> 00:22:10,655
But I don't believe he's a bad guy.

217
00:22:12,362 --> 00:22:14,023
Bring him back to the Gate.

218
00:22:15,465 --> 00:22:16,898
Master,

219
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:20,899
I'm Turbo from overseas.

220
00:22:21,104 --> 00:22:24,130
I was invincible in Chinatown...

221
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,706
But I know...

222
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,572
you're well versed in martial arts.

223
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:30,768
I wanna aggregate

224
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,505
the skills of all schools...

225
00:22:33,716 --> 00:22:36,446
to manifest the spirits
of Chinese kungfu.

226
00:22:36,653 --> 00:22:38,553
I'd therefore like to be your disciple.

227
00:22:43,493 --> 00:22:45,688
I'll be your disciple no matter what!

228
00:22:55,238 --> 00:22:56,603
You still here?

229
00:22:57,006 --> 00:22:58,064
Wait!

230
00:22:58,374 --> 00:22:59,966
I ain't gonna give up!

231
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:03,274
You're great in nunchaku.

232
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,313
Can you teach me?

233
00:23:07,016 --> 00:23:09,712
I won't teach you.
But we can practice together.

234
00:23:10,653 --> 00:23:12,052
Great!

235
00:23:20,797 --> 00:23:22,458
Where's your nunchaku?

236
00:23:27,303 --> 00:23:29,362
By the way, I'm also called the Judo Kid!

237
00:23:29,572 --> 00:23:30,732
Come on!

238
00:23:36,513 --> 00:23:38,674
Wow, excellent footwork!

239
00:23:39,415 --> 00:23:41,747
By the way, how you got that scar?

240
00:23:42,218 --> 00:23:43,185
How you got that scar?

241
00:23:43,386 --> 00:23:44,284
I can't hear you.

242
00:23:44,487 --> 00:23:45,454
I said your scar...

243
00:23:48,691 --> 00:23:52,058
I got the scar while practicing.

244
00:23:52,795 --> 00:23:55,195
But the other guy is a limp now.

245
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:57,894
So be careful!

246
00:24:18,888 --> 00:24:21,482
Dragon, Come over!

247
00:24:30,533 --> 00:24:32,694
It's for Dad's safety.

248
00:24:32,902 --> 00:24:34,062
Let's do it together.

249
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,999
Am I not good enough...

250
00:24:36,205 --> 00:24:37,797
to protect you?

251
00:24:38,007 --> 00:24:39,736
Come fight me!

252
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:44,412
No way! I don't wanna kill you!

253
00:24:45,148 --> 00:24:46,513
Then I'll die for sure

254
00:24:46,716 --> 00:24:48,411
Better rely on yourself than on gods.

255
00:24:48,618 --> 00:24:50,586
I won't let anything happen to you...

256
00:24:50,787 --> 00:24:52,618
or your dad.

257
00:24:54,624 --> 00:24:57,650
If Dad retired,

258
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,885
you wouldn't need to protect us.

259
00:25:00,096 --> 00:25:02,394
We'd all be safe then.

260
00:25:05,168 --> 00:25:07,329
Where would you go

261
00:25:07,537 --> 00:25:09,505
if you could retire?

262
00:25:14,277 --> 00:25:15,710
Take this one first.

263
00:25:15,912 --> 00:25:18,506
I'll go get another one.

264
00:25:33,262 --> 00:25:35,162
Mom, did Tiger's mom

265
00:25:35,365 --> 00:25:36,832
take Dad away from us?

266
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:38,898
I hate them!

267
00:25:39,602 --> 00:25:41,399
You shouldn't hate

268
00:25:41,604 --> 00:25:43,663
any member of the Gate.

269
00:25:44,073 --> 00:25:45,165
Dad and I separated

270
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:47,070
not because of them.

271
00:25:47,276 --> 00:25:49,642
It's my own decision.

272
00:25:50,913 --> 00:25:54,246
Dragon, come out! It's Tiger!

273
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,543
Go away! Don't come see me anymore!

274
00:25:56,753 --> 00:25:59,051
I don't wanna see anyone
from the Gate ever!

275
00:25:59,255 --> 00:26:01,314
Get lost!

276
00:26:16,472 --> 00:26:17,632
Why you crying?

277
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,569
I'll beat you till you smile!

278
00:26:26,249 --> 00:26:28,877
Stop! Stop!

279
00:26:36,526 --> 00:26:37,857
Stop him. Don't let him run away.

280
00:26:38,061 --> 00:26:39,050
Stop!

281
00:26:39,262 --> 00:26:41,628
Still running, smart ass?

282
00:26:42,098 --> 00:26:43,395
Wanna fight back?

283
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:45,159
What you guys want?

284
00:26:45,368 --> 00:26:46,596
What?

285
00:26:46,803 --> 00:26:47,895
Beat him up!

286
00:26:51,741 --> 00:26:53,231
Take his slipper!

287
00:26:53,443 --> 00:26:55,638
Don't come back to this park again!

288
00:26:55,845 --> 00:26:57,642
Let's go!

289
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,859
Hurry up, Tiger!

290
00:27:13,229 --> 00:27:14,958
Okay. I'm coming!

291
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,003
Let me give you my slipper,

292
00:27:22,205 --> 00:27:24,639
or your mom will yell at you.

293
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:26,900
What about your mom?

294
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,168
It won't be a problem.

295
00:27:28,377 --> 00:27:29,969
Thanks!

296
00:27:32,682 --> 00:27:35,378
You don't wanna know
why I was in a fight?

297
00:27:37,787 --> 00:27:40,722
'Cos I know Dragon is a man of justice.

298
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,480
Unless they're in the wrong,

299
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:45,022
you wouldn't have picked a fight.

300
00:27:45,228 --> 00:27:46,957
They were bullying Tiger.

301
00:27:47,363 --> 00:27:50,799
So I fought with them.

302
00:28:02,211 --> 00:28:03,872
Carry this jade pendant with you.

303
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,742
You're a member of the Gate
wherever you go.

304
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,944
You'll make it big in the future.

305
00:28:10,353 --> 00:28:13,288
Remember you're Wong Fuhu's son.

306
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:16,324
Don't ever commit a crime.

307
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:18,249
Your life...

308
00:28:18,461 --> 00:28:21,089
will be fraught with frustrations.

309
00:28:21,464 --> 00:28:25,059
You will come back to the Gate
with your head up.

310
00:28:25,635 --> 00:28:27,535
Never give up

311
00:28:27,737 --> 00:28:29,796
however difficult life will become.

312
00:28:31,207 --> 00:28:33,141
What you meant by "make it big"?

313
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:35,270
You'll know when you grow up.

314
00:28:37,647 --> 00:28:39,080
Come!

315
00:28:42,084 --> 00:28:44,314
When will I make it big?

316
00:28:56,732 --> 00:28:58,723
Dragon, your mom

317
00:28:58,935 --> 00:29:00,926
hasn't come out yet!

318
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:04,435
Mom never came out.

319
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,308
She was never seen again.

320
00:29:08,644 --> 00:29:10,441
It's lucky

321
00:29:10,847 --> 00:29:12,644
I met Kun.

322
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,877
Out of gratitude,

323
00:29:18,054 --> 00:29:21,148
I've done reluctant things for him.

324
00:29:22,258 --> 00:29:24,590
I know I can't leave here...

325
00:29:25,194 --> 00:29:28,186
I'm ashamed to go back
to the Gate ever again.

326
00:29:41,878 --> 00:29:43,641
Dragon!

327
00:29:55,658 --> 00:29:57,455
I'm your baby brother!

328
00:29:57,827 --> 00:30:00,022
I know. So what?

329
00:30:00,229 --> 00:30:02,390
Am I supposed to hug you
with tears in my eyes?

330
00:30:02,598 --> 00:30:06,261
And you hug me and call me Bro?

331
00:30:09,772 --> 00:30:12,070
Uncle and I want you back to the Gate.

332
00:30:12,508 --> 00:30:14,772
Don't work for this bad guy Kun anymore!

333
00:30:18,681 --> 00:30:21,650
So you're a good guy and I'm a bad guy.

334
00:30:22,184 --> 00:30:23,208
Go back to the Gate

335
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:25,216
and play your good guy!

336
00:30:58,554 --> 00:30:59,919
Chan!

337
00:31:01,324 --> 00:31:02,723
I'm Tiger Wong.

338
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,527
You're no fun!

339
00:31:08,264 --> 00:31:09,925
You and Dragon are tight?

340
00:31:11,534 --> 00:31:14,697
He works for my dad.
I treat him like a brother.

341
00:31:14,904 --> 00:31:16,565
You're his baby brother?

342
00:31:17,206 --> 00:31:19,538
You don't look alike.

343
00:31:21,711 --> 00:31:23,474
You guys are brothers.

344
00:31:23,846 --> 00:31:26,007
Why you act like that?

345
00:31:31,053 --> 00:31:32,680
That's why I wanna help him.

346
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:38,522
Good! Gimme your phone.

347
00:31:56,879 --> 00:31:58,813
Listen. Hurry up!

348
00:32:01,183 --> 00:32:03,117
- Hello. - Hello.

349
00:32:07,656 --> 00:32:10,716
This is my number. Remember to call me!

350
00:32:13,596 --> 00:32:16,394
Aren't you gonna help me?

351
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:20,399
Sure, but I didn't say now.

352
00:32:21,103 --> 00:32:23,731
I'll call you when I find him. Bye.

353
00:32:49,665 --> 00:32:52,828
Thanks for taking care
of Scaly and his dogs.

354
00:32:53,035 --> 00:32:55,026
They've been nothing but trouble lately.

355
00:32:55,504 --> 00:32:57,165
You can always quit.

356
00:32:57,573 --> 00:32:59,165
Not so simple!

357
00:33:00,943 --> 00:33:04,310
What's so hard?

358
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,716
I've been in this biz forever.

359
00:33:09,151 --> 00:33:11,813
Xiaoling is my only worry.

360
00:33:12,955 --> 00:33:16,948
I've taken you for my dad,

361
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,485
and Xiaoling my sis.

362
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:26,692
I won't let anything
bad happen to my folks.

363
00:33:28,604 --> 00:33:30,731
I believe you.

364
00:33:31,006 --> 00:33:32,633
Just sleep on it.

365
00:33:33,943 --> 00:33:37,606
And you? Will you go back to the Gate?

366
00:33:37,947 --> 00:33:39,505
Yes,

367
00:33:40,449 --> 00:33:41,643
but it's not the right time yet.

368
00:33:41,851 --> 00:33:43,478
I'll wait till you've retired.

369
00:33:43,686 --> 00:33:45,483
Wanna get rid of me?

370
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:52,386
Yes. Give the Plaque back to Lousha Gang.

371
00:34:31,867 --> 00:34:33,994
Nunchaku Slippers! Watch out!

372
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:43,501
You should be practicing!

373
00:34:44,246 --> 00:34:46,146
Playing with slippers?

374
00:34:46,348 --> 00:34:49,181
No more slippers for a month.

375
00:34:49,385 --> 00:34:50,875
Take them all off!

376
00:35:06,702 --> 00:35:10,763
You don't wanna teach me.

377
00:35:12,074 --> 00:35:13,701
At least practice with me!

378
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:18,604
You're best at nunchaku?

379
00:35:19,481 --> 00:35:20,812
Yes.

380
00:35:21,283 --> 00:35:24,343
Please pick a weapon, Master!

381
00:35:53,949 --> 00:35:56,179
You're clueless.

382
00:35:56,986 --> 00:35:59,716
Worse than the kids.

383
00:36:00,522 --> 00:36:03,150
You know nothing about nunchaku.

384
00:36:03,525 --> 00:36:05,015
Come back when you know...

385
00:36:05,227 --> 00:36:08,355
how to grasp a nunchaku.

386
00:36:41,263 --> 00:36:42,491
I'm Turbo,

387
00:36:42,698 --> 00:36:45,428
invincible in Chinatown.

388
00:36:48,137 --> 00:36:50,128
You're clueless.

389
00:36:51,073 --> 00:36:53,405
You know nothing nunchaku.

390
00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:55,601
Come back when you know...

391
00:36:55,811 --> 00:36:59,269
how to grasp a nunchaku.

392
00:37:22,371 --> 00:37:25,431
I was always bullied as I grew up abroad.

393
00:37:26,308 --> 00:37:27,900
I didn't like that.

394
00:37:28,677 --> 00:37:30,907
So I slashed a scar on my face.

395
00:37:32,381 --> 00:37:34,645
I wanna scare people off.

396
00:37:35,651 --> 00:37:38,245
I learnt nunchaku

397
00:37:38,854 --> 00:37:41,379
'cos it's fierce and powerful.

398
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:45,524
But today I was totally beaten.

399
00:37:47,262 --> 00:37:49,924
I thought I had grasped it very hard...

400
00:37:50,799 --> 00:37:53,324
but he took it from me so easily!

401
00:37:55,704 --> 00:37:57,433
After a long struggle,

402
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,135
I finally realized...

403
00:38:01,243 --> 00:38:05,441
it's not a matter of strength...

404
00:38:06,749 --> 00:38:08,740
but of the heart.

405
00:38:10,419 --> 00:38:12,512
I can't scare people...

406
00:38:12,888 --> 00:38:15,379
with a scar on my face.

407
00:38:18,727 --> 00:38:21,389
I won't tell my scar story anymore.

408
00:38:23,465 --> 00:38:25,660
But I'll say...

409
00:38:26,602 --> 00:38:30,231
Master Wong left
a slipper mark on my face.

410
00:38:34,843 --> 00:38:36,538
I will keep it up.

411
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,080
Thanks!

412
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,952
Turbo!

413
00:38:58,367 --> 00:39:02,269
You know how to do household chores?

414
00:39:02,471 --> 00:39:05,872
I don't, but I will learn!

415
00:39:21,056 --> 00:39:24,116
Kun wants to return
the Plaque and retire?

416
00:39:24,326 --> 00:39:27,227
That's good news for you.

417
00:39:33,235 --> 00:39:35,669
I'll arrange for you to join Lousha Gang.

418
00:39:36,572 --> 00:39:40,531
That way... we can be together.

419
00:39:46,348 --> 00:39:48,441
Why you staring at me?

420
00:39:49,485 --> 00:39:51,043
I want you to understand...

421
00:39:51,253 --> 00:39:54,313
I can make Shibumi
let you take Kun's place.

422
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:58,456
You can be your own boss finally!

423
00:39:59,661 --> 00:40:02,129
I shouldn't have rescued you that day.

424
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:25,550
Listen up, Dragon!

425
00:40:25,754 --> 00:40:27,915
Whether you join the Gang or not,

426
00:40:29,825 --> 00:40:33,693
we ain't good guys.

427
00:40:52,981 --> 00:40:57,008
We cannot change our fate.

428
00:41:17,205 --> 00:41:19,036
- Dragon, I... - Xiaoling.

429
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:21,198
You know Tiger?

430
00:41:21,577 --> 00:41:22,874
Yeah.

431
00:41:23,245 --> 00:41:24,542
Arrange a meeting for us,

432
00:41:25,547 --> 00:41:26,775
please.

433
00:41:50,973 --> 00:41:52,873
You know where we are?

434
00:41:54,977 --> 00:41:57,445
You won't recall. You were just a kid.

435
00:41:57,813 --> 00:41:59,041
It used to be a park.

436
00:41:59,247 --> 00:42:01,841
And there was a monkey bar here.

437
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,274
After we were beaten,

438
00:42:03,485 --> 00:42:05,146
you liked to hide here.

439
00:42:06,555 --> 00:42:09,080
I'll learn my kungfu well.
I'll beat them up!

440
00:42:09,324 --> 00:42:12,623
Kungfu is for protecting people,

441
00:42:12,828 --> 00:42:15,160
not for fighting.

442
00:42:15,731 --> 00:42:17,392
We will never be bad guys

443
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:18,531
no matter what.

444
00:42:18,734 --> 00:42:19,928
Got it?

445
00:42:20,135 --> 00:42:21,397
Got it.

446
00:42:22,371 --> 00:42:26,102
Look! That's the direction
to the Dragon Tiger Gate.

447
00:42:28,343 --> 00:42:30,777
Ever beaten anyone you shouldn't have?

448
00:42:32,014 --> 00:42:34,778
No! Never!

449
00:42:36,418 --> 00:42:40,013
But I have. Many times!

450
00:42:41,423 --> 00:42:42,754
Many things

451
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:45,188
have happened to me,

452
00:42:46,628 --> 00:42:49,358
but you won't understand.

453
00:42:50,732 --> 00:42:53,633
I wanna tell you today...

454
00:42:54,703 --> 00:42:56,603
I'm proud of you.

455
00:42:57,105 --> 00:42:59,699
'Cos you can stick to your principles!

456
00:42:59,908 --> 00:43:01,569
I also have my principles.

457
00:43:02,444 --> 00:43:04,537
I know where I should go.

458
00:43:09,685 --> 00:43:11,084
Let's go.

459
00:43:13,655 --> 00:43:14,815
Hey!

460
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,352
I'll wait for you at home!

461
00:43:16,558 --> 00:43:19,584
Cool. See you at the Gate!

462
00:43:29,004 --> 00:43:32,030
Giving up the Plague is an insult to me!

463
00:43:33,108 --> 00:43:34,473
Rosa.

464
00:43:34,676 --> 00:43:37,668
Both Kun and Dragon must die!

465
00:43:37,879 --> 00:43:39,710
Watch out!

466
00:43:40,048 --> 00:43:42,380
Xiaoling, show us what you got!

467
00:43:42,584 --> 00:43:44,950
Do your best, Xiaoling!

468
00:44:01,403 --> 00:44:03,837
Dad, how did I do?

469
00:44:04,339 --> 00:44:05,465
Not too bad.

470
00:44:06,608 --> 00:44:08,405
I'm the best

471
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:10,601
in the team.

472
00:44:10,812 --> 00:44:12,336
And you call that "not too bad"?!

473
00:44:12,547 --> 00:44:15,710
I was the best softball player once.

474
00:44:15,917 --> 00:44:19,353
Your game is just kiddy stuff for me!

475
00:44:19,755 --> 00:44:20,949
Cool!

476
00:44:21,156 --> 00:44:23,716
If you're so good, let's play a game!

477
00:44:23,925 --> 00:44:25,392
Okay, you arrange it.

478
00:44:25,594 --> 00:44:28,461
But you better get changed now.
We'll go eat.

479
00:44:28,663 --> 00:44:29,630
Dragon is on his way.

480
00:44:29,831 --> 00:44:31,025
Cool!

481
00:44:35,737 --> 00:44:36,635
Hello.

482
00:44:36,838 --> 00:44:39,204
Dragon, I have to see you now.

483
00:44:39,541 --> 00:44:41,031
But I don't feel like it.

484
00:44:42,911 --> 00:44:44,708
You'll regret if you don't show up.

485
00:45:09,171 --> 00:45:13,130
So fast! You must miss me!

486
00:45:22,918 --> 00:45:26,251
Have you ever done it in the water?

487
00:45:31,059 --> 00:45:31,753
I thought you had

488
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,121
something urgent to tell me.

489
00:45:44,573 --> 00:45:46,131
Tattoo for me.

490
00:45:47,943 --> 00:45:49,968
Why?

491
00:45:51,513 --> 00:45:54,710
My birthday present.

492
00:45:56,151 --> 00:45:58,244
You have birthday?

493
00:45:58,954 --> 00:46:01,980
You saved me years ago.

494
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,590
To me, that's my birthday.

495
00:46:12,267 --> 00:46:16,226
Forget it. I know you won't.

496
00:46:22,644 --> 00:46:24,077
Turn around.

497
00:46:46,234 --> 00:46:47,758
Go away!

498
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:49,965
You'll fall to your death!

499
00:46:50,171 --> 00:46:52,264
None of your business. Go way!

500
00:46:52,474 --> 00:46:55,272
Jump down and I'll catch you.

501
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:05,887
What's your name?

502
00:47:06,087 --> 00:47:07,554
Dragon.

503
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:09,449
Yours?

504
00:47:09,658 --> 00:47:11,057
Rosa.

505
00:47:14,996 --> 00:47:15,985
What you staring at?

506
00:47:16,197 --> 00:47:17,630
Can't I stare?

507
00:47:22,437 --> 00:47:24,462
I'll be in love with you forever.

508
00:47:34,849 --> 00:47:36,783
What have you tattooed for me?

509
00:48:00,008 --> 00:48:02,568
I've always wanted to
stare at you like that.

510
00:48:09,718 --> 00:48:11,310
I was supposed to kill you.

511
00:48:11,586 --> 00:48:13,281
Double Devils are off to kill Kun.

512
00:48:13,555 --> 00:48:15,420
It's too late.

513
00:50:17,612 --> 00:50:18,579
Go to hell!

514
00:50:22,417 --> 00:50:23,816
You bloody old man!

515
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:27,213
I'm good but you treat me like shit!

516
00:50:27,422 --> 00:50:29,515
Better to work for
Lousha Gang than for you.

517
00:50:30,391 --> 00:50:33,724
Retire? Not so easy!

518
00:50:33,928 --> 00:50:35,555
Let me retire you now!

519
00:50:37,465 --> 00:50:39,194
Don't hit me, Kun!

520
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,301
I was just kiddin'!

521
00:50:42,504 --> 00:50:44,972
- You back-stabbing asshole!
- Let me retire with you.

522
00:50:48,276 --> 00:50:50,403
Help! Double Devils!

523
00:50:50,612 --> 00:50:53,342
Help!

524
00:51:15,003 --> 00:51:16,402
Dad!

525
00:55:27,989 --> 00:55:29,889
Watch over her!

526
00:57:09,156 --> 00:57:12,091
Remember you're Wong Fuhu's son.

527
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,894
You'll make it big in the future.

528
00:57:15,329 --> 00:57:18,264
You will come back to the Gate
with your head up.

529
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:20,260
Never give up...

530
00:57:20,468 --> 00:57:22,595
however difficult life will become.

531
00:58:44,518 --> 00:58:46,247
My dad...

532
00:58:46,821 --> 00:58:48,812
Will he go to heaven?

533
00:58:51,192 --> 00:58:55,219
He will. He loved you so much.

534
00:59:01,502 --> 00:59:05,404
Better ask when the bad guys
will go to hell!

535
00:59:09,977 --> 00:59:12,309
From now on, the Gate is your home.

536
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:15,614
Even if my limps are broken,

537
00:59:15,916 --> 00:59:18,077
I won't let anyone harm you.

538
00:59:57,725 --> 01:00:01,661
Double Devils were beaten
by people from the Gate.

539
01:00:05,666 --> 01:00:07,861
The Gate is really that strong?

540
01:00:08,502 --> 01:00:10,129
Good!

541
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,108
Master,

542
01:00:22,917 --> 01:00:23,815
we haven't found Tiger yet.

543
01:00:24,018 --> 01:00:25,781
Baldy and others are searching for him!

544
01:00:36,997 --> 01:00:38,760
Who's the best here?

545
01:01:35,456 --> 01:01:36,753
Watch out for...

546
01:01:37,658 --> 01:01:38,955
the "Black Pagoda"!

547
01:03:03,911 --> 01:03:07,972
So Dragon Tiger Gate's kungfu sucks!

548
01:03:45,753 --> 01:03:48,381
You're not good enough
to die under my hands!

549
01:04:05,105 --> 01:04:06,572
But you can!

550
01:04:22,256 --> 01:04:24,224
Find your brother.

551
01:04:24,425 --> 01:04:27,952
Guard the Gate together...

552
01:05:01,362 --> 01:05:04,559
Xiaoling, should anything
happen to anyone...

553
01:05:04,765 --> 01:05:06,289
bring them to Mt Baiyun...

554
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:08,468
and look for a guy called Qi.

555
01:06:57,978 --> 01:06:59,377
Master!

556
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:06,246
Master! Master...

557
01:07:06,453 --> 01:07:08,944
Please save my friends!

558
01:07:10,924 --> 01:07:14,985
Their wounds are too deep for me.

559
01:07:15,863 --> 01:07:17,626
All over Mt Baiyun,

560
01:07:17,831 --> 01:07:21,426
Only Qi can help them.

561
01:07:22,336 --> 01:07:24,133
Where can I find Qi?

562
01:07:25,305 --> 01:07:27,296
Inside the pagoda.

563
01:07:28,575 --> 01:07:30,736
I'll find him once I get up there?

564
01:07:30,944 --> 01:07:34,004
No one has ever entered the pagoda!

565
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,851
Stay put!

566
01:07:41,121 --> 01:07:43,089
Pick up the prayer beads.

567
01:07:58,672 --> 01:08:01,266
Pick up all the prayer beads.

568
01:08:59,533 --> 01:09:01,091
Master Qi

569
01:09:25,926 --> 01:09:27,917
Here are all the prayer beads.

570
01:09:28,128 --> 01:09:30,392
Please save my friends.

571
01:09:30,697 --> 01:09:33,097
There's still one bead below the pagoda.

572
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:38,795
You've gone an arduous way.

573
01:09:39,006 --> 01:09:41,634
Your friends must mean a lot to you.

574
01:09:42,075 --> 01:09:44,339
If you can jump down the pagoda...

575
01:09:44,544 --> 01:09:47,445
to pick up the bead...

576
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,280
then I will save them.

577
01:10:05,966 --> 01:10:08,161
I hope you'll keep your promise.

578
01:10:20,714 --> 01:10:23,012
Did I ever go up there?

579
01:10:24,751 --> 01:10:27,345
Everything is an illusion
in the mundane world.

580
01:10:27,554 --> 01:10:30,421
Only your conviction is real.

581
01:10:31,391 --> 01:10:34,383
The moment you decided
to sacrifice yourself...

582
01:10:34,728 --> 01:10:37,356
the prayer bead was already in your hand.

583
01:10:42,469 --> 01:10:45,529
Don't worry. I will save your friends.

584
01:10:49,142 --> 01:10:52,805
No one at the Gate is good enough
to beat Double Devils.

585
01:10:53,013 --> 01:10:56,744
I know your relationship with Dragon.

586
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:58,178
He's good.

587
01:10:58,385 --> 01:11:00,080
I wanna fight with him.

588
01:11:00,721 --> 01:11:02,086
Take this to save him.

589
01:11:02,289 --> 01:11:04,883
He should die under my hands.

590
01:11:31,418 --> 01:11:35,218
You'll be okay after the acupuncture.

591
01:11:37,858 --> 01:11:41,726
Your internal power might even increase.

592
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:54,836
Don't move.

593
01:11:55,776 --> 01:11:57,505
Don't say a word.

594
01:12:04,151 --> 01:12:06,312
I was also adopted.

595
01:12:07,354 --> 01:12:09,822
No one ever cares how I feel.

596
01:12:11,024 --> 01:12:13,492
I did this for you today,

597
01:12:13,727 --> 01:12:15,592
so you'll care for me.

598
01:12:18,165 --> 01:12:20,565
Even if you don't love me,

599
01:12:22,335 --> 01:12:24,667
I can make you hate me!

600
01:12:49,996 --> 01:12:52,260
This pill can only save one person.

601
01:12:52,499 --> 01:12:53,989
You can either save Dragon...

602
01:12:54,267 --> 01:12:56,326
or yourself!

603
01:13:21,761 --> 01:13:23,319
Dragon,

604
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,161
have you ever loved me?

605
01:15:22,115 --> 01:15:25,744
Tiger, I'll teach you
"Electric Dragon Drill."

606
01:15:28,221 --> 01:15:30,917
Turbo, I'll teach you "Golden Mask."

607
01:16:44,097 --> 01:16:46,657
Tiger, Turbo,

608
01:16:46,866 --> 01:16:49,198
I'm giving you two gadgets.

609
01:16:49,402 --> 01:16:52,337
They can help you fight Shibumi.

610
01:16:52,639 --> 01:16:54,368
But whether you'll win in the end

611
01:16:54,574 --> 01:16:56,599
depends on yourselves.

612
01:17:28,108 --> 01:17:29,575
Wait for me at the Gate.

613
01:17:33,046 --> 01:17:34,638
I promise I'll be back.

614
01:19:05,338 --> 01:19:06,930
Looking for your own death?

615
01:19:49,048 --> 01:19:50,743
Your kungfu has improved a lot!

616
01:19:59,058 --> 01:20:01,185
Let's have a good fight!

617
01:21:09,529 --> 01:21:10,928
That's it?

618
01:21:13,132 --> 01:21:14,895
Anything more?

619
01:22:19,665 --> 01:22:21,394
Your "Golden Mask" is not bad!

620
01:22:49,262 --> 01:22:50,593
Anything else?

621
01:23:24,163 --> 01:23:27,894
Electric Dragon Drill! Embarrassing!

622
01:23:40,546 --> 01:23:43,344
On behalf of the Gate,
I'm returning the Plaque to you.

623
01:23:45,318 --> 01:23:47,878
Dragon, I've been waiting for you!

624
01:25:01,794 --> 01:25:03,125
Eighteen Dragon Slaying Palms?

625
01:25:17,476 --> 01:25:20,411
That's all you have, Shibumi? How slow!

626
01:28:51,857 --> 01:28:54,257
We can go back to the Gate now,

627
01:28:56,028 --> 01:28:57,518
Little Bro!

628
01:29:45,544 --> 01:29:46,511
Tiger!

629
01:29:46,879 --> 01:29:47,903
Tiger is back!

630
01:29:48,113 --> 01:29:48,772
Tiger!

631
01:29:48,981 --> 01:29:50,005
Tiger!

632
01:29:50,716 --> 01:29:52,115
Tiger!

633
01:29:59,158 --> 01:30:02,423
Uncle, we're back, my brother and me.

634
01:30:12,538 --> 01:30:14,472
Uncle said the Gate...

635
01:30:14,673 --> 01:30:16,834
should be passed on to both of us.

636
01:30:17,843 --> 01:30:19,811
Yo, what about me?

637
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:22,010
Ever think about changing

638
01:30:22,214 --> 01:30:23,875
your name to Leopard?

639
01:30:24,850 --> 01:30:27,512
Turbo Leopard? Sounds fierce!
