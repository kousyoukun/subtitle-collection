1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,750
Dragon Tiger Gate was founded...

2
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:05,000
By 2 kungfu masters

3
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:08,000
Wong Jianglong and Wong Fuhu

4
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,100
They protected self-strengthening

5
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:14,400
To free people from oppression

6
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:18,900
They even taught martial arts

7
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:20,700
To street orphans

8
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:24,000
The gate thus became the symbol of justice

9
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:27,001
While every youth was eager to join the Gate

10
00:01:27,002 --> 00:01:31,000
Wong Fuhu's son Dragon

11
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:35,100
Decided to leave

12
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:39,000
He was to part with his baby brother...

13
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:42,200
Tiger

14
00:01:47,201 --> 00:01:50,201
Black Pagoda

15
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,202
Luosha

16
00:02:25,203 --> 00:02:27,803
You always perform trouble with such fashion,

17
00:02:27,804 --> 00:02:30,800
so I decided to continue cooperating with you,

18
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:32,801
give LuoSha to him,

19
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:34,802
Let her work for us earnestly,

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Remember

21
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:40,001
The LuoSha medallion stands for a LuoSha person

22
00:02:46,002 --> 00:02:48,002
I already gave you the LuoSha medallion

23
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:50,003
If there is something wrong,

24
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,004
You should preside over

25
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:57,005
Yes, I understand, I will exert myself

26
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,500
Hey!

27
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:11,501
Chan

28
00:03:12,502 --> 00:03:13,502
Do you remember me?

29
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:18,503
- Xiao...
- Thats it!

30
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,800
So you still remember me?

31
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,000
Grade 5, right?

32
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:28,450
Not grade 5! Grade 3!

33
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,001
Almost the same...

34
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:35,000
Not at all, what a poor memory

35
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,200
Remember the fatso in our class?

36
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:42,200
Sure, the one who cried all the time?

37
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,500
No, the one who wet his pants!

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,500
Well, he cried after he wet his pants

39
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:52,500
I remember he liked pulling your hair

40
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,300
It couldnt be! I had short hair then

41
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,900
I remember you had long hair

42
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,900
How can I forget I had short hair?

43
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:08,200
Like, would you forget your called Chan?

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,001
Look who has a poor memory?

45
00:04:14,002 --> 00:04:16,500
I'm not Chan, Xiaowei!

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm not Xiaowei

47
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,001
I'm sorry

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,500
So what is your name?

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,500
Tiger Wong

50
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,001
I'm Ma Xiaoling

51
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Hey Tiger!
Hey Tiger!

52
00:05:12,501 --> 00:05:14,000
Why so many people?

53
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:16,500
Ma Kun has reserved...

54
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:18,300
the whole upper floor

55
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:19,301
Ma Kun?

56
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:21,302
The biggest kingpin in hong kong

57
00:05:21,303 --> 00:05:24,500
Those dudes in the black are his dogs

58
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,000
Some dudes in white are breaking in!

59
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,000
They're the White Lions,
as powerful as Kun

60
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Black or White,
they're still bad guys

61
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,001
Kun, so you got the Plaque again

62
00:05:47,002 --> 00:05:52,000
You have a monopoly over all smuggling gigs

63
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:55,800
It takes juice to work with the Luosha Gang

64
00:05:55,801 --> 00:05:58,600
You got to work harder!

65
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,500
Juice? I got much more than you!

66
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:05,501
I want half your cut!

67
00:06:05,502 --> 00:06:07,502
You kiddin', or what?

68
00:06:07,503 --> 00:06:10,503
Whoever has the plaque can get all the cut

69
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:14,504
You want half?
Your outta your mind!

70
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:21,505
Nice food!
It's payup time!

71
00:06:22,506 --> 00:06:23,506
Mom!

72
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
How dare you welsh on our debts!

73
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:28,501
Not that I don't want to pay
We're the victims

74
00:06:28,502 --> 00:06:29,502
We've paid alot already!

75
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:32,000
Let them be, they are Kun's dogs

76
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:36,001
Stay put!
Master won't like it!

77
00:06:36,002 --> 00:06:40,500
Shibumi gave me the plaque

78
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:44,501
Come get it if you dare

79
00:06:53,502 --> 00:06:55,502
Even if I let you go

80
00:06:55,503 --> 00:06:57,503
My boss Fan won't

81
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,000
Enjoying your food, Huh?

82
00:07:03,001 --> 00:07:04,001
Tiger!

83
00:07:44,002 --> 00:07:46,002
Where's the Plaque?

84
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,003
Who are you?

85
00:07:49,004 --> 00:07:51,004
Tiger Wong!

86
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:53,500
Find the Plaque

87
00:07:53,501 --> 00:07:57,501
or you can't leave!

88
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,002
I'll take sole responsibility for what I've done!

89
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Go down!

90
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Let him go

91
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Why?

92
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Gosh, Fan has gotten way out of hand

93
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,001
All crap!

94
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
What you starin' at Dragon Wong?

95
00:11:05,501 --> 00:11:08,501
You wanna fight me one on one?

96
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Why'd you let that kid go just now, Kun?

97
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:15,001
None of them were able to beat him

98
00:11:15,002 --> 00:11:18,002
And the White Tigers were watching
If Kun hadn't let him go...

99
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:21,000
2 gangs would have started fighting
What good would that do, you crazy?

100
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:22,500
Who cares about the White Lions?

101
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:26,000
You're just a bodyguard,
I could have taken him out on my own!

102
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:28,001
I'm good!

103
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,000
Fan....
Come fight me one on one!

104
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:32,001
Scram!

105
00:11:34,002 --> 00:11:36,002
You better watch out!

106
00:11:42,003 --> 00:11:44,500
Why didn't you go all the way

107
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,501
when fighting that kid?

108
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:00,000
I will get you the plaque back

109
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,001
We have a job today?

110
00:12:34,002 --> 00:12:36,002
Why is gold brand in your hair?

111
00:12:36,003 --> 00:12:38,003
I went to pick up things when you started to fight!

112
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:41,004
If it can be sold, waou, we can collect alot of money

113
00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:42,005
Yeah, I think so

114
00:12:42,006 --> 00:12:45,006
When we sell it,
we can use the money to do some kind-hearted things

115
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:47,007
My God, we can use the money to do kind-hearted things?!
It's with a free hand!

116
00:12:47,008 --> 00:12:49,008
Hey, hey, hey, we drink to make a decision..
Who is the winner?

117
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:50,500
Of course, our brother

118
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
It's obvious, isn't it?

119
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:57,501
Hey, hey, hey, in a word, our brothers character is good,

120
00:12:57,502 --> 00:12:59,502
- Kind-hearted, everything is good.
- "Yeah!"

121
00:13:01,503 --> 00:13:04,503
-Brother, cheer up!
-Cheer up!
-Ok, cheer up!

122
00:13:05,506 --> 00:13:07,506
Thanks!

123
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,000
The sushi today is so good!
Very delicious!

124
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:44,001
2 more orders please!

125
00:13:44,002 --> 00:13:46,002
Hurry up!

126
00:13:47,003 --> 00:13:48,500
Tiger is our boss today

127
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:50,000
He'll start first

128
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:53,001
Tiger, this's for you!

129
00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:56,002
And this is for me!

130
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,003
Gimme the Plaque

131
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The plaque

132
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:06,001
What plaque?
What plaque?

133
00:14:07,002 --> 00:14:08,002
This one?

134
00:14:08,003 --> 00:14:10,003
The plaque is your head!

135
00:14:11,004 --> 00:14:13,004
You want this?

136
00:14:13,005 --> 00:14:14,005
How much can you pay?

137
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,006
You weren't all that bad last time!

138
00:14:31,007 --> 00:14:33,007
Dragon!

139
00:14:34,008 --> 00:14:35,008
You get lost or what?

140
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:37,000
I came here to give you a hand!

141
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,500
I poisoned their wine!

142
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:40,501
I already got the Plaque

143
00:14:40,502 --> 00:14:42,000
I hate dirty tricks!

144
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:45,001
The Plaque is ours
They're having fun with it

145
00:14:45,002 --> 00:14:46,800
We got every right to beat them up

146
00:14:46,801 --> 00:14:49,500
What did you say before?
Me dirty?

147
00:14:49,501 --> 00:14:52,501
You dumbass
Let me teach you a lesson!

148
00:14:52,502 --> 00:14:54,502
Beat him up!!!

149
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,503
You dare touch me?

150
00:15:01,504 --> 00:15:03,504
Beat him up too!

151
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,000
You guys will need an ambulence real soon

152
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
I said beat him up!
Who you fightin' with?

153
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:29,500
Dragon wong!

154
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:34,000
Didn't you say you're a good fighter?

155
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,001
Go in!

156
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,002
Beat the crap out of anyone you see!

157
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:36,500
I hate to be disturbed at my meals

158
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,501
Your nunchuku sucks
Better practice more!

159
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,502
Let's practice together sometime!

160
00:18:45,503 --> 00:18:47,000
Thanks for your help

161
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:50,001
You're welcome
Just couldn't stand them!

162
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,500
I'm Turbo Shek

163
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,500
Tiger Wong

164
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:58,000
Tiger?

165
00:18:58,001 --> 00:19:00,001
A Fierce name!
Gotta split now!

166
00:19:05,002 --> 00:19:06,500
You guys okay?

167
00:19:06,501 --> 00:19:08,500
We're fine

168
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,000
No blood was shed

169
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:14,001
Hey, is this yours?
I just found it

170
00:19:20,002 --> 00:19:22,002
Tiger

171
00:19:23,002 --> 00:19:25,500
Where is Dragon Tiger Gate?

172
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:11,501
Xing, you snatched the Plaque

173
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,502
You better explain to the master yourself

174
00:20:25,503 --> 00:20:28,503
Stop staring,
you can touch it

175
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,504
I got this scar when I was a kid

176
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:45,505
When I was at your age

177
00:20:45,506 --> 00:20:47,506
I already knew kungfu well

178
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:49,507
Once, I passed by someone wielding
his sword

179
00:20:50,508 --> 00:20:52,508
And there went this scar

180
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:55,509
It's such a big golden Plaque

181
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,510
I had to snatch it

182
00:20:56,511 --> 00:20:59,511
Then this long-haired guy asked me for it
Of course I wouldn't give it to him

183
00:20:59,512 --> 00:21:00,512
So he beat us up

184
00:21:00,513 --> 00:21:02,513
He punched me and I ran

185
00:21:02,514 --> 00:21:04,514
Just like what you taught us

186
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:06,515
And the rest is history

187
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:08,516
We're really not to blame!

188
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,517
Indeed, Master!
We're not to blame!

189
00:21:11,518 --> 00:21:14,518
The Plaque you snatched is called
Luosha Plaque

190
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:18,519
It's the transaction permit between
Luosha Gang and Kun

191
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,520
Luosha Gang is a crime organization

192
00:21:23,521 --> 00:21:26,521
You snatched their stuff...

193
00:21:26,522 --> 00:21:29,522
and claim your innocent?!

194
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:32,523
Get out and squat for 3 hours!

195
00:21:35,524 --> 00:21:38,524
Would someone give me a hand?
I can't see!

196
00:21:39,525 --> 00:21:41,525
Hold on!

197
00:21:47,526 --> 00:21:49,526
Uncle

198
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:53,527
I saw my brother again

199
00:21:54,528 --> 00:21:56,528
He's Kun's man now

200
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So he's bed to Luosha Gang

201
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But I don't believe he's a bad guy

202
00:22:03,001 --> 00:22:05,001
Bring him back to the Gate

203
00:22:07,002 --> 00:22:09,002
Master

204
00:22:10,003 --> 00:22:13,003
I'm Turbo Shek from overseas

205
00:22:13,004 --> 00:22:16,004
I was invincible in Chinatown

206
00:22:16,005 --> 00:22:18,005
But I know

207
00:22:18,006 --> 00:22:21,006
You're well versed in martial arts

208
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:25,007
I wanna aggregate the skills of all schools

209
00:22:25,008 --> 00:22:28,008
To manifest the spirits of Chinese Kungfu

210
00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:31,009
I'd therefore like to be your disciple

211
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,010
I'll be your disciple no matter what!

212
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:48,011
You still here?

213
00:22:48,012 --> 00:22:50,012
Wait!

214
00:22:50,013 --> 00:22:52,013
I ain't gonna give up!

215
00:22:53,014 --> 00:22:55,014
You're great in nunchaku

216
00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:57,015
Can you teach me?

217
00:22:58,016 --> 00:23:01,016
I won't teach you
but we can practice together

218
00:23:02,017 --> 00:23:03,017
Great!

219
00:23:12,018 --> 00:23:14,018
Where's your nunchaku?

220
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:21,019
By the way
I'm also called the Judo Kid!

221
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,020
Come on

222
00:23:28,021 --> 00:23:30,021
Wow!
Excellent footwork!

223
00:23:30,022 --> 00:23:32,022
By the way,
how did you get that scar?

224
00:23:34,023 --> 00:23:35,023
How did you get that scar?

225
00:23:35,024 --> 00:23:36,024
I can't hear you

226
00:23:36,025 --> 00:23:38,025
I said your scar...

227
00:23:40,026 --> 00:23:42,026
I got the scar while practicing

228
00:23:43,027 --> 00:23:45,027
The other guy has a limp now

229
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:49,028
So  be careful!

230
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:12,029
Dragon, come over

231
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:25,030
It's for dad's safety
Let's do it together

232
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:27,031
Am I not good enough...

233
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,032
to protect you?

234
00:24:29,033 --> 00:24:31,033
Come, fight me!

235
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:35,034
No way! I don't want to kill you!

236
00:24:36,035 --> 00:24:38,035
Then I'll die for sure

237
00:24:38,036 --> 00:24:40,036
Better to rely on yourself than on gods

238
00:24:40,037 --> 00:24:42,037
I won't let anything happen to you...

239
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:44,038
or your dad

240
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:48,039
If dad retired...

241
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,040
you wouldn't need to protect us

242
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:53,041
We'd all be safe then

243
00:24:56,042 --> 00:25:00,042
Where would you go if you could retire?

244
00:25:05,043 --> 00:25:07,043
Take this one first

245
00:25:07,044 --> 00:25:09,044
I'll go get another one

246
00:25:24,045 --> 00:25:28,045
Mom, did Dragon's mom take
dad away from us?

247
00:25:29,046 --> 00:25:31,046
I hate them

248
00:25:31,047 --> 00:25:34,047
You shouldn't hate any member of Gate

249
00:25:35,048 --> 00:25:39,048
Dad and I separated not because of them

250
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:41,049
It's my own decision

251
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:46,050
Dragon... Come out, It's Tiger

252
00:25:46,051 --> 00:25:48,051
Go away! Dont come see me anymore!

253
00:25:48,052 --> 00:25:50,052
I don't want to see anyone from
the Gate ever!

254
00:25:50,053 --> 00:25:53,053
Get lost!

255
00:26:07,054 --> 00:26:09,054
Why are you crying?

256
00:26:09,055 --> 00:26:11,055
I'll beat you till you smile!

257
00:26:17,056 --> 00:26:19,056
Stop! Stop!

258
00:26:27,057 --> 00:26:29,057
Stop him! Don't let him get away!

259
00:26:29,058 --> 00:26:31,058
Stop!

260
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:34,059
Still running,
smartass?

261
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,060
Wanna fight back?

262
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,061
What you guys want?

263
00:26:38,062 --> 00:26:39,062
What?

264
00:26:39,063 --> 00:26:41,063
Beat him up!

265
00:26:43,064 --> 00:26:45,064
Take his slipper!

266
00:26:45,065 --> 00:26:47,065
Don't come back to this park again!

267
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:50,066
Lets go!

268
00:27:01,067 --> 00:27:03,067
Hurry up Tiger!

269
00:27:03,068 --> 00:27:06,068
Okay, I'm coming!

270
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:13,069
Let me give you my slipper

271
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:16,070
or your mom will yell at you

272
00:27:16,071 --> 00:27:18,071
What about your mom?

273
00:27:19,072 --> 00:27:20,072
It won't be a problem

274
00:27:20,073 --> 00:27:22,073
Thanks

275
00:27:24,074 --> 00:27:27,074
You don't wanna know why
I was in a fight?

276
00:27:28,075 --> 00:27:31,075
I know that Dragon is a man of justice

277
00:27:32,076 --> 00:27:34,076
Unless they're in the wrong...

278
00:27:34,077 --> 00:27:36,077
you wouldn't have picked a fight

279
00:27:36,078 --> 00:27:38,078
They were bullying Tiger

280
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:41,079
So I fought with them

281
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,080
Carry this jade pendant with you

282
00:27:55,081 --> 00:27:58,081
Your a member of the gate
wherever you go

283
00:27:58,082 --> 00:28:01,082
You'll make it big in the future

284
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:04,083
Remember, you're Wong Fuhu's son

285
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:07,084
Don't ever commit a crime

286
00:28:08,085 --> 00:28:10,085
Your life...

287
00:28:10,086 --> 00:28:12,086
will be frought with frustrations

288
00:28:12,087 --> 00:28:15,087
You will come back to the Gate
with your head up

289
00:28:17,088 --> 00:28:20,088
Never give up, no matter how difficult
life will become

290
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:25,089
What did you mean by "Make it big"?

291
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,090
You'll know when you grow up

292
00:28:28,091 --> 00:28:30,091
Come

293
00:28:33,092 --> 00:28:35,092
When will I make it big?

294
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:51,093
Dragon! Your mom hasn't come out yet!

295
00:28:53,094 --> 00:28:55,094
Mom never came out

296
00:28:56,095 --> 00:28:59,095
She was never seen again

297
00:29:01,096 --> 00:29:03,096
It was lucky I met Kun

298
00:29:03,097 --> 00:29:05,097
Out of gratitude

299
00:29:07,098 --> 00:29:11,098
I've done reluctant things for him

300
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:16,099
I know I can't leave here...

301
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,500
I'm ashamed to go back to the
Gate ever again

302
00:29:32,501 --> 00:29:34,501
Dragon

303
00:29:46,502 --> 00:29:48,502
I'm your baby brother!

304
00:29:48,503 --> 00:29:50,503
I know,
so what?

305
00:29:50,504 --> 00:29:53,504
Am I supposed to hug you
with tears in my eyes?

306
00:29:53,505 --> 00:29:56,505
And you hug me and call me bro?

307
00:30:00,506 --> 00:30:02,506
Uncle and I want you back at the Gate

308
00:30:02,507 --> 00:30:05,507
Don't work for this bad guy Kun anymore

309
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,500
So you're a goodguy and I'm a badguy?

310
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Go back to the Gate and play
your good guy!

311
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,500
Chan!

312
00:30:52,501 --> 00:30:54,501
I'm Tiger Wong

313
00:30:55,502 --> 00:30:57,502
You're no fun

314
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
You and Dragon are tight?

315
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:05,001
He works for my dad,
I treat him like a brother

316
00:31:06,002 --> 00:31:08,002
You're his baby brother?

317
00:31:08,003 --> 00:31:10,003
You don't look alike

318
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:17,004
If you guys are brothers,
Why'd you act like that?

319
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,005
Thats why I wanna help him

320
00:31:26,006 --> 00:31:29,006
Good! Gimme your phone

321
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:50,007
Listen, hurry up!

322
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:02,008
This is my number, remember to call me!

323
00:32:05,009 --> 00:32:07,009
Aren't you going to help me?

324
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,010
Sure, but I didn't say now

325
00:32:12,011 --> 00:32:16,011
I'll call you when I find him, bye

326
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,500
Thank you for taking care of Fan
and his dogs

327
00:32:43,501 --> 00:32:45,501
They've been nothing but trouble lately

328
00:32:46,502 --> 00:32:48,502
You can always quit

329
00:32:48,503 --> 00:32:49,503
It's not so simple

330
00:32:51,504 --> 00:32:54,504
What's so hard?

331
00:32:57,505 --> 00:33:00,000
I've been in this biz forever

332
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:02,001
Xiaoling is my only worry

333
00:33:04,002 --> 00:33:06,002
I've taken you for my dad

334
00:33:08,003 --> 00:33:11,003
And Xiaoling my sis

335
00:33:14,004 --> 00:33:17,004
I won't let anything bad
happen to my folks

336
00:33:19,005 --> 00:33:21,005
I believe you

337
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,500
Just sleep on it

338
00:33:24,501 --> 00:33:28,501
And you? Will you go back to the Gate?

339
00:33:28,502 --> 00:33:30,502
Yes

340
00:33:30,503 --> 00:33:32,503
But its not the right time yet

341
00:33:32,504 --> 00:33:34,504
I'll wait till you've retire

342
00:33:34,505 --> 00:33:37,505
Wanna get rid of me?

343
00:33:39,506 --> 00:33:42,506
Yes, the Plaque back to Luosha Gang

344
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:24,507
Nunchacku Stippers, watch out!

345
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,008
You should be beaten!

346
00:34:35,009 --> 00:34:38,009
Playing with slippers?
No more slippers for a month!

347
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:41,010
Take them all off!

348
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,500
You don't want to teach me

349
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,501
At least practice with me!

350
00:35:07,502 --> 00:35:09,502
You are best at nunchaku?

351
00:35:10,503 --> 00:35:12,000
Yes

352
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,504
Please, pick a weapon Master!

353
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
You are clueless

354
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:50,001
Worse than the kids!

355
00:35:51,002 --> 00:35:53,002
You know nothin about Nunchaku

356
00:35:54,003 --> 00:35:56,003
Come back when you know...

357
00:35:56,004 --> 00:35:59,004
how to handle a nunchaku!

358
00:36:32,005 --> 00:36:34,405
I'm Turbo Shek

359
00:36:34,406 --> 00:36:36,406
Invincible in Chinatown

360
00:36:39,407 --> 00:36:41,407
You are clueless

361
00:36:42,008 --> 00:36:44,508
You know nothing about nunchaku

362
00:36:44,509 --> 00:36:46,509
Come back when you know...

363
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,510
How to handle a nunchaku!

364
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I was always bullied
as I grew up abroad

365
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,001
I didn't like that

366
00:37:19,002 --> 00:37:22,002
So I slashed a scar on my face

367
00:37:23,003 --> 00:37:25,003
I  want to scare people off

368
00:37:26,004 --> 00:37:29,004
I learned nunchaku...

369
00:37:29,005 --> 00:37:32,005
because it's fierce and powerful

370
00:37:34,006 --> 00:37:37,006
But today I was totally beaten

371
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:41,007
I thought I was very good

372
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,000
But he took it from me so easily!

373
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,500
After a long struggle

374
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:51,000
I finally realized...

375
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
It's not a matter of strength...

376
00:37:57,503 --> 00:37:59,503
But of the heart

377
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I can't scare people

378
00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:06,001
With a scar on my face

379
00:38:09,002 --> 00:38:12,002
I won't tell my scar story anymore

380
00:38:14,003 --> 00:38:16,003
But I will say...

381
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:20,004
Master Wong left a
slipper mark on my face

382
00:38:25,005 --> 00:38:27,005
I will keep it up

383
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:31,006
Thanks

384
00:38:42,007 --> 00:38:44,007
Turbo!

385
00:38:49,008 --> 00:38:53,008
You know how to do household chores?

386
00:38:53,009 --> 00:38:57,009
I don't, but I will learn!

387
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:14,010
Kun wants to return
the Plaque and retire?

388
00:39:15,011 --> 00:39:18,011
Thats good news for you

389
00:39:23,012 --> 00:39:26,012
I will arrange for
you to join Luosha Gang

390
00:39:27,013 --> 00:39:31,013
That way... we can be together

391
00:39:37,014 --> 00:39:39,500
Why are you staring at me?

392
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:41,501
I want you to understand...

393
00:39:41,502 --> 00:39:44,502
I can make Shabumi
let you take Kuns's place

394
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
You can be your own boss finally

395
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:53,201
I shouldn't have rescued you that day

396
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Listen up, Dragon

397
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:19,001
Wether you join Luosha Gang or not

398
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:24,002
We aren't good guys

399
00:40:43,003 --> 00:40:47,003
We cannot change our fate

400
00:41:07,004 --> 00:41:09,500
-Dragon, I...
-Xiaoling

401
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:11,501
You know Tiger?

402
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,500
Yeah

403
00:41:13,501 --> 00:41:15,501
Arrange a meeting for us

404
00:41:15,502 --> 00:41:17,502
Please

405
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,500
Do you remember what used to be here?

406
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:47,501
At that time you were little,
so you must not remember it

407
00:41:47,502 --> 00:41:48,502
There was a park here before

408
00:41:48,503 --> 00:41:51,503
Where we are sitting was a hob

409
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,504
We always liked to hang out here

410
00:41:56,505 --> 00:41:58,505
When I train and increase my skills, I can defeat them

411
00:41:59,506 --> 00:42:00,506
Xiao Hu...

412
00:42:00,507 --> 00:42:02,507
learn, strength is not to be used to hurt people

413
00:42:02,508 --> 00:42:04,508
but use it to protect people

414
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
In any case, from now on
we couldn't become malefactor

415
00:42:09,001 --> 00:42:10,001
Understand?

416
00:42:10,002 --> 00:42:11,002
Understood

417
00:42:12,003 --> 00:42:13,003
Look there!

418
00:42:14,004 --> 00:42:16,004
There is the direction to Dragon Tiger Gate!

419
00:42:19,005 --> 00:42:21,005
Wether or not you beat one,
who you shouldn't beat?

420
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:24,006
No, never

421
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,500
I have

422
00:42:28,501 --> 00:42:30,501
I have beaten alot

423
00:42:31,502 --> 00:42:32,502
Since a long time ago in fact...

424
00:42:32,503 --> 00:42:34,503
there were a lot of things happening around me

425
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
But if I tell you, you may not understand

426
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:44,001
Today I called you out
In fact, I want to tell you...

427
00:42:45,002 --> 00:42:47,002
I am happy you are my brother,

428
00:42:47,003 --> 00:42:49,003
because you stand by your principle all the time

429
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,004
I have my own principle

430
00:42:52,005 --> 00:42:54,005
I know what I must do

431
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,500
I am going

432
00:43:03,501 --> 00:43:05,001
Hey

433
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:06,500
I'm waiting here

434
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:07,501
Okay

435
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,502
See you at Dragon Tiger Gate!

436
00:43:19,003 --> 00:43:22,003
Giving up the Plaque is an insult to me!

437
00:43:23,004 --> 00:43:25,004
Lousha

438
00:43:25,005 --> 00:43:27,500
Both Kun and Dragon must die!

439
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Watch out!

440
00:43:31,001 --> 00:43:32,500
Xiaoling, show us what you got!

441
00:43:32,501 --> 00:43:34,501
Do your best, Xiaoling!

442
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,002
Dad, how did I do?

443
00:43:54,003 --> 00:43:55,503
Not too bad

444
00:43:57,004 --> 00:44:00,004
I'm the best on the team

445
00:44:00,005 --> 00:44:02,005
and you call that "Not too bad"?

446
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:05,506
I was the best softball player once

447
00:44:05,507 --> 00:44:08,507
Your game is just kiddy stuff for me!

448
00:44:10,008 --> 00:44:11,008
Cool

449
00:44:11,009 --> 00:44:14,009
If your so good, lets play a game!

450
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:16,010
Okay, you arrange it

451
00:44:16,011 --> 00:44:20,011
But you better get changed now,
we're going to eat

452
00:44:20,012 --> 00:44:22,012
Cool!

453
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,500
Hello

454
00:44:26,501 --> 00:44:28,501
Dragon, I have to see you now

455
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:31,002
But I don't feel like it

456
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,003
You will regret it if you
don't show up

457
00:44:59,004 --> 00:45:02,004
So fast, you must stalk me!

458
00:45:13,005 --> 00:45:16,005
You ever made love in the water?

459
00:45:21,006 --> 00:45:23,006
I thought you had something
urgent to tell me

460
00:45:35,007 --> 00:45:37,007
A tattoo for me

461
00:45:38,008 --> 00:45:39,008
Why?

462
00:45:41,109 --> 00:45:44,009
My birthday present

463
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,010
It's your birthday?

464
00:45:49,011 --> 00:45:51,011
You saved me years ago

465
00:45:53,012 --> 00:45:56,012
To me, thats my birthday

466
00:46:02,013 --> 00:46:06,013
Forget it, I know you won't

467
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,500
Turn around

468
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,001
Go away!

469
00:46:38,002 --> 00:46:40,002
You will fall!

470
00:46:40,003 --> 00:46:42,003
This is none of your business, go away!

471
00:46:42,004 --> 00:46:44,004
Jump down and I will catch you

472
00:46:55,005 --> 00:46:56,005
What is your name?

473
00:46:56,006 --> 00:46:58,006
Dragon

474
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,500
Yours?

475
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,500
Rose

476
00:47:05,001 --> 00:47:06,501
What are you staring at?

477
00:47:06,502 --> 00:47:07,502
Can't I stare?

478
00:47:12,003 --> 00:47:14,003
I will be in love with you forever

479
00:47:24,004 --> 00:47:27,004
What have you tattooed for me?

480
00:47:49,005 --> 00:47:52,005
I have always wanted to
stare at you like that

481
00:47:59,006 --> 00:48:01,006
I was supposed to kill you

482
00:48:01,007 --> 00:48:03,007
Double Devils are off to kill Kun

483
00:48:03,008 --> 00:48:06,008
It's too late

484
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,009
You bloody old man!

485
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:16,010
I'm good, but you treat me like shit

486
00:50:17,011 --> 00:50:19,011
I'd rather work for the
Lucsha Gang than for you!

487
00:50:20,012 --> 00:50:22,012
Retire?

488
00:50:22,013 --> 00:50:24,013
Let me retire you!

489
00:50:27,014 --> 00:50:29,014
Don't hit me, Kun!

490
00:50:29,015 --> 00:50:32,015
I was just kidding!

491
00:50:33,016 --> 00:50:35,016
You back stabbing asshole!
Let me retire with you!

492
00:50:38,017 --> 00:50:40,017
Help! Daemon!

493
00:50:40,018 --> 00:50:42,018
Help Stick!

494
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:07,019
Dad!

495
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:20,020
Watch over her

496
00:57:00,021 --> 00:57:02,021
Remember, you are Wong Fuhu's son

497
00:57:03,022 --> 00:57:05,022
You will make it big in the future

498
00:57:06,023 --> 00:57:08,023
You will come back to the 
Gate with your head up

499
00:57:09,024 --> 00:57:11,024
Never give up

500
00:57:11,025 --> 00:57:13,025
However difficult life may become

501
00:58:34,026 --> 00:58:36,026
My dad...

502
00:58:36,027 --> 00:58:38,027
Will he goto Heaven?

503
00:58:40,028 --> 00:58:43,028
He will, he loved you so much

504
00:58:51,029 --> 00:58:54,029
 Better to ask when the 
bad guys will goto Hell!

505
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:01,030
From now on, the Gate is your home

506
00:59:02,031 --> 00:59:05,031
Even if my limbs are broken

507
00:59:05,032 --> 00:59:08,032
I won't let anyone harm you

508
00:59:47,033 --> 00:59:50,033
Daemon and Stick were beaten
by people from the Gate

509
00:59:55,034 --> 00:59:57,034
The Gate is really that strong?

510
00:59:58,035 --> 01:00:00,035
Good!

511
01:00:09,036 --> 01:00:11,036
Master!

512
01:00:12,037 --> 01:00:16,037
We haven't found Tiger yet.
Xing and the others are searching for him!

513
01:00:26,038 --> 01:00:28,038
Who's the best here?

514
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:27,039
Watch out for...

515
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,040
the "Black Pagoda"!

516
01:02:53,041 --> 01:02:55,041
So Dragon Tiger Gate's kungfu is this weak?

517
01:03:35,042 --> 01:03:38,042
You are not worthy enough
to die by my hands

518
01:03:54,043 --> 01:03:56,043
But you can!

519
01:04:11,044 --> 01:04:13,044
Find your brother

520
01:04:13,045 --> 01:04:16,045
Guard the Gate together!

521
01:04:51,046 --> 01:04:54,046
Xiaoling,
should anything happen to anyone...

522
01:04:54,047 --> 01:04:56,047
Bring them to Mt Baiyun..

523
01:04:56,048 --> 01:04:57,048
And look for a man called Qi

524
01:06:47,049 --> 01:06:49,049
Master!

525
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:54,050
Master! Master!

526
01:06:55,051 --> 01:06:57,051
Please save my friends!

527
01:07:00,052 --> 01:07:04,052
Their wounds are too deep for me

528
01:07:05,053 --> 01:07:07,053
All over Mt Baiyun

529
01:07:07,054 --> 01:07:10,054
Only Qi can help them

530
01:07:12,055 --> 01:07:14,055
Where can I find Qi?

531
01:07:14,056 --> 01:07:16,056
Inside the pagoda

532
01:07:17,507 --> 01:07:19,057
I will find him once I get up there?

533
01:07:19,058 --> 01:07:22,058
No one has ever entered the pagoda

534
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:30,559
Stop!

535
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:32,560
Pick up the prayer beads

536
01:07:47,561 --> 01:07:50,561
Pick up all the prayer beads!

537
01:08:48,002 --> 01:08:50,002
Master Qi!

538
01:09:14,003 --> 01:09:17,003
Here are all the prayer beads

539
01:09:17,004 --> 01:09:19,004
Please save my friends!

540
01:09:19,505 --> 01:09:21,505
There is still one bead below the pagoda

541
01:09:25,506 --> 01:09:27,506
You have come a long way

542
01:09:27,507 --> 01:09:30,507
Your friends must mean alot to you

543
01:09:31,008 --> 01:09:33,008
If you can jump down the pagoda...

544
01:09:33,009 --> 01:09:36,009
to pick up the bead...

545
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:40,010
Then, I will save them

546
01:09:55,012 --> 01:09:57,012
I hope you'll keep your promise

547
01:10:09,013 --> 01:10:11,013
Did I ever really go up there?

548
01:10:13,014 --> 01:10:16,014
Everything is an illusion
in the mundane world

549
01:10:17,015 --> 01:10:19,015
Only your conviction is real

550
01:10:20,016 --> 01:10:22,016
the moment you decided to 
sacrifice yourself...

551
01:10:23,017 --> 01:10:26,017
the prayer bead was 
already in your hand

552
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:34,018
Don't worry, I will save your friends

553
01:10:38,019 --> 01:10:41,019
No one at the Gate was good enough
 to beat Daemon and Stick

554
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:45,020
I know your relationship with Dragon

555
01:10:46,021 --> 01:10:49,021
He's good, I want to fight with him

556
01:10:49,022 --> 01:10:51,022
Take this to save him

557
01:10:51,023 --> 01:10:53,023
He should die under my hand

558
01:11:27,024 --> 01:11:30,024
You'll be okay after the acupuncture

559
01:11:32,524 --> 01:11:36,524
Your internal power might even increase

560
01:11:42,005 --> 01:11:44,005
Don't move

561
01:11:44,006 --> 01:11:46,006
Don't say a word

562
01:11:52,507 --> 01:11:54,507
I was also adopted

563
01:11:56,008 --> 01:11:58,008
No one ever cares how I feel

564
01:11:59,509 --> 01:12:01,509
I did this for you today

565
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:04,510
So you'll care for me

566
01:12:07,011 --> 01:12:09,011
Even if you don't love me

567
01:12:11,012 --> 01:12:13,512
I can make you hate me

568
01:12:38,513 --> 01:12:40,513
This pill can only save one person

569
01:12:41,014 --> 01:12:43,014
You can either save Dragon...

570
01:12:43,015 --> 01:12:45,015
or yourself!

571
01:13:10,016 --> 01:13:13,016
Dragon

572
01:13:15,017 --> 01:13:18,017
Have you ever loved me?

573
01:15:10,018 --> 01:15:14,018
Tiger, I'll teach you
"Electric Dragon Drill"

574
01:15:17,019 --> 01:15:20,019
Turbo, I'll teach you "Golden Mask"

575
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:35,020
Tiger, Turbo

576
01:16:35,021 --> 01:16:37,501
I'm giving you two weapons

577
01:16:37,502 --> 01:16:40,502
They can help you fight Shibumi

578
01:16:40,503 --> 01:16:44,503
But wether you win in the end
depends on yourselves

579
01:17:16,504 --> 01:17:18,504
Wait for me at the Gate

580
01:17:21,505 --> 01:17:23,505
I promise I'll be back

581
01:18:54,006 --> 01:18:56,006
Looking for your own death?

582
01:19:36,007 --> 01:19:38,007
Your Kungfu has improved alot!

583
01:19:47,008 --> 01:19:49,008
Let's have a good fight!

584
01:20:57,509 --> 01:20:59,509
That's it?

585
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Anything more?

586
01:22:07,501 --> 01:22:09,501
Your "Golden Mask" is not bad!

587
01:22:37,002 --> 01:22:39,002
Anything else?

588
01:23:12,003 --> 01:23:17,003
"Electric Dragon Drill"! Embarrasing!

589
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:30,504
On behalf of the Gate
I'm returning the Plaque to you

590
01:23:33,005 --> 01:23:35,005
Dragon, I've been waiting for you!

591
01:24:49,006 --> 01:24:51,006
"Eighteen Dragon Staying Palms"?!

592
01:25:05,007 --> 01:25:08,007
That's all you have Shibumi?
How slow!

593
01:28:39,008 --> 01:28:42,008
We can go back to the Gate now

594
01:28:43,509 --> 01:28:45,509
Little Brother

595
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Tiger!

596
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:36,001
Tiger is back!

597
01:29:36,002 --> 01:29:38,002
Tiger!

598
01:29:38,003 --> 01:29:39,003
Tiger!

599
01:29:46,504 --> 01:29:49,504
Uncle, we're back
My brother and me

600
01:30:00,005 --> 01:30:02,005
Uncle said the Gate...

601
01:30:02,006 --> 01:30:04,006
should be passed on to the both of us

602
01:30:04,007 --> 01:30:07,007
Yo, what about me?

603
01:30:08,508 --> 01:30:10,508
Ever think about changing
your name to Leopard?

604
01:30:12,009 --> 01:30:15,009
Turbo Leopard? Sounds fierce!
