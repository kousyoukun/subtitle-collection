1
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,213
- Julian.
- Hey.

2
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:35,506
- You came all the way out here?
- Yeah.

3
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:36,799
I had to leave somebody off
up on the beach.

4
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,092
- Thought I'd drop by.
- It's been weeks.

5
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,802
- Hi.
- Hi.

6
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,762
Hello, girls.

7
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:45,141
You mean you didn't fly down to Rio
for the weekend?

8
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,437
- Don't mind them. They're just jealous.
- I don't mind.

9
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,648
I've been trying to reach you all day.

10
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,610
Yeah, I got the message. Number?

11
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,404
Tonight. It's a woman
from Charlottesville.

12
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:02,783
She's flying in to close a negotiation
on her husband's estate.

13
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,995
- First time?
- Yeah.

14
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,706
She's meeting with the lawyers
in the morning.

15
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,499
They want a chauffeur.

16
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,170
Is she into drugs?

17
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,589
No, no drugs.

18
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,426
$1,000, right?

19
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,846
$600 for me.

20
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,681
Julie, don't start this up again.

21
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,808
Look, you want 50-50? You go get Mike.

22
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,603
Or one of those high school dropouts
you like so much.

23
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:35,024
There's no percentage in it
if I don't get 50-50.

24
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,652
You already cut me out of the repeaters.

25
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,279
It's only fair. Only fair.

26
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:44,283
It ain't fair, Julie,
but I don't have any choice.

27
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:45,660
You got a choice.
You got a lot of choice.

28
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,745
You can keep dealing
those retarded faggots

29
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,289
- who don't know class from...
- Look who's talking.

30
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,004
All right. 50-50.

31
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,844
Who'd you drop off up the beach?

32
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,972
Wouldn't you like to know.

33
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,599
Julie, why do you do this to me?

34
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:11,686
Look, you know anybody else
who gets in the LA Country Club?

35
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:16,857
And that's not the Hillcrest,
or the Riverside, or the Riviera.

36
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,902
I gotta run now, so why don't you
leave the info on the service?

37
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,863
You don't want to take some sun?

38
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,241
I'm sure the girls
would like some company.

39
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:31,664
No, thanks. No way. See you later.

40
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,708
How's the Swedish coming?

41
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,460
Okay.

42
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,255
Do you want me to help you?

43
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:24,300
Listen to the recording
and repeat what you hear.

44
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,803
Listen and then repeat.

45
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:41,233
I am not interested in that.

46
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:55,664
How much farther have we to go?

47
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,841
Is this your first visit?

48
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,927
Okay.

49
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,687
Yeah?

50
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,065
Okay, let him through.

51
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,234
Hey, Leon, what's up?

52
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,610
Hey, Julie, baby, listen,

53
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,404
I hate to bug you like this,
but you gotta help me out.

54
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,573
I had this Palm Springs gig
set up for Joey

55
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,618
and the bitch split.
Least he ain't nowhere around.

56
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,370
No, I can't do it.

57
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,957
Getting a haircut now.
I got something on later this afternoon.

58
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,084
Baby, baby, this is a two-hour gig.

59
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,461
- Plus the drive.
- Plus the drive.

60
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,463
Five C's. Straight in-and-out job.

61
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,715
Nothing fancy. Come on.
Do me a favour.

62
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,761
I don't know. Maybe. If I get some time.

63
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,138
I'll give you 50 bucks.

64
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:55,391
You go fuck yourself.
You think I'm in this for charity?

65
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,269
Hey! Hey, hey, wait a minute, here.
Who's doing who a favour?

66
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,229
Who called who up, begging for a sub?

67
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,691
Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I appreciate it.

68
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,026
Anything for a friend.

69
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,747
Excuse me.

70
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,585
Mind if I take my cap off, ma'am?

71
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,879
No, of course not.

72
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,925
Thank you.

73
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,566
I think I know this hotel
better than I do my own apartment.

74
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,111
All the important people
come and stay here.

75
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:53,073
You know, I used to be a pool boy here.

76
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,161
Anything I can do to help you?

77
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,705
Look, I'll open up
the champagne for you.

78
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,125
- You don't have to open up the...
- Julian. My name is Julian.

79
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,462
You don't have to open the champagne.

80
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,590
I will give you a tip, don't worry.

81
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,301
Oh, Jesus.

82
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:17,640
Look, I'm sorry, Mrs Dobrun.
That's not what I meant at all. I was...

83
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,270
I'm sorry.

84
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,775
This your first time in LA?

85
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:34,240
- Maybe you can be a help to me.
- Yeah?

86
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,409
Well, I haven't been here
for several years

87
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,163
and I was wondering if there are
any new really good restaurants.

88
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,667
You know,
where the famous people go?

89
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,169
Yeah, well,

90
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,965
it's probably safer to recommend
the more established restaurants.

91
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:57,554
There's Ma Maison and La Scala,

92
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,599
and Scandia.

93
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,272
And of the newer ones,
I hear that Le Dome is quite nice.

94
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,107
Very popular.

95
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:14,530
My, you are making me
thirsty just standing there.

96
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:19,034
Now you can open the champagne.

97
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,329
Pour me a drink,

98
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,457
and set the bottle down.

99
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,222
Yeah, she liked the pool boy bit.

100
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,392
I'm going to see her again
tomorrow afternoon.

101
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,479
Yeah.

102
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,732
Okay, Anne. Yes. Love you, too.

103
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,287
Paging Mrs Anderson.

104
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,122
- Mrs Anderson, front desk, please.
- Hey, pretty lady.

105
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,333
- Hi.
- Got my other jacket?

106
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,586
- Sure. Here you go, Julian.
- Thanks.

107
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,008
- Good evening, Mr Kay.
- Vince. How are you doing?

108
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,885
Fine. Nice to see you.

109
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,431
Then he has the nerve
to hit on my sister...

110
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,151
- It's not the greatest job in the world.
- Yeah.

111
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,236
- You get to meet people...
- Thank you.

112
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,821
Yeah, I'll have a Scotch on the rocks.

113
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,573
No, he's not.

114
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:43,118
I told you. He's looking right at us.

115
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,086
What'll it be?

116
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,962
No, that's okay, Jim.

117
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,994
Je m'appelle Julian Kay.

118
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,081
Excusez-moi, Michelle Jost.

119
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,131
Mr Kay would like another drink.

120
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,052
Manhattan. Dry Manhattan on the rocks.

121
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,345
Yes, sir.

122
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,431
- You speak English.
- You speak English.

123
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,933
- You fooled me.
- And you, me.

124
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:50,602
How long have you been over here
in Los Angeles?

125
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,771
I live here.

126
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:55,107
You live here? I don't understand.

127
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,191
You wouldn't.

128
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,529
I'm just trying to refresh
my college French.

129
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,908
I usually practise with a friend,
but she's not here yet.

130
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,131
Where are you from?

131
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,928
I was born in Torino,
but I studied at Nantes.

132
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,598
You hardly have any accent at all.

133
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,808
Yeah, I've been travelling too much.

134
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,394
I envy you.

135
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,063
I love to travel.

136
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:40,235
I used to travel a lot, but my husband's
involved in local politics.

137
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,697
So now I just practise French.

138
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,951
He thinks it's chic
to have a bilingual wife.

139
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,997
I think he's right.

140
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,874
Where are you going?

141
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,044
I made a mistake.

142
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,509
My husband's in New York.

143
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,930
What about your friend?

144
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,976
I'm not waiting for anyone.

145
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,772
You still don't understand.

146
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,565
Understand what?

147
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,737
Who I am.

148
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,616
Who are you?

149
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:32,663
You don't even understand who you are,
why you're sitting here.

150
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,666
Why are you here?

151
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,545
I've got to go.

152
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,797
All right. Just one thing.

153
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,675
Why did you come on to me?

154
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,844
Like I said, I made a mistake.

155
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,139
I heard you speaking French.

156
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,268
Often in these big hotels,

157
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,395
you run into women
from foreign countries

158
00:14:56,479 --> 00:15:00,816
who may need a translator or a guide.

159
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,279
And they hire you?

160
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,573
Yes.

161
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,497
How many languages do you speak?

162
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,042
Five or six.

163
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:26,550
Plus the international language.

164
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,179
That's right.

165
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,188
Well, now,

166
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:44,067
you're something really special,
aren't you?

167
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,531
You're one to talk.

168
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:54,036
I saw you sitting here. You wanted me
to come over. I came over.

169
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:57,039
I know what I see.

170
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,877
How much would you have charged me?

171
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,296
As what? Translator or guide?

172
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,714
No.

173
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,591
Just one fuck.

174
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,638
Now, you've made a mistake.
I don't do that.

175
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,973
You don't, huh?

176
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:20,062
I know what I see, too, Monsieur Kay.

177
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:26,276
It's been a pleasure talking to you,
Madame Jost.

178
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,154
Don't spoil it. Bonne chance.

179
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,772
Look, mister,
someone's made a mistake here.

180
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,023
I don't do fags.

181
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,608
I didn't mean that.

182
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,401
And I don't do couples, either.

183
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,112
No, no, no. You don't understand.

184
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:37,616
It's just my wife Judy. Not me.

185
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:41,411
- Just her.
- Okay.

186
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:45,207
- But I can watch.
- Of course.

187
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,543
Would you like a drink?

188
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,217
Not yet.

189
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,971
I think I'd like my money now.

190
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,849
Sure. Sure.

191
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,229
- I like to talk afterwards, too.
- Sure.

192
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,641
Hello, Judy.

193
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,312
You're a very sexy lady,
a very good-looking woman.

194
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:54,609
Very pretty woman.
You're gonna like me.

195
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,696
I can tell.

196
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:02,450
Because I like you. I like you.

197
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:07,289
So just relax and close your eyes.

198
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:12,043
Just relax and let your mind run free.

199
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,090
Don't worry about anything.

200
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,635
I can take care of you.
I know what you want.

201
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,476
That's right. Close your eyes.

202
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,188
Forget about him.

203
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,275
This has nothing to do with him.
This is just you and me.

204
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,903
No, no, no, from behind.

205
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,156
It has to be from behind.

206
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,914
Okay, baby,
just flip over on your stomach.

207
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:53,501
Just relax. Don't worry.
Leave everything to me,

208
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,547
'cause I'm gonna take care of you.
I'm gonna take care of you.

209
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:02,260
I'm gonna get you wet.
I'm gonna get you very wet.

210
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,554
I know how to do this.

211
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,390
Now slap her.

212
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,023
Slap that cunt.

213
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:27,744
Hey, Leon.

214
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,205
- How you doing, Julie?
- All right.

215
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:38,046
I want to thank you
for helping me out, Julie.

216
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:43,593
Finally found Joey holed up
with one of his boyfriends,

217
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:47,597
just banging away, you know how it is.
Dumb bastard.

218
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,140
Hello, Julian.

219
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,227
- Hi. I'll just have a Perrier.
- Okay.

220
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:53,728
Okay.

221
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:58,692
You made quite a hit in Palm Springs.
They want you back.

222
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:03,071
I'm serious.
They want you to come back this week.

223
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:09,494
I wouldn't take much, you know. It's...
They're regulars for me.

224
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:13,123
You lied to me, Leon.
It was a rough trick.

225
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:19,170
I forgot. You got scruples now, huh?

226
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,883
I don't like playing
the same numbers too often.

227
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,302
They get possessive.

228
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,055
I can't be possessed.

229
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,766
That include Miss Anne?

230
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,352
Anne who?

231
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:38,440
Boy, I don't know why you fool around
with that dumb bitch.

232
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,941
I'll tell you why, Leon.

233
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,862
She's got a job coming up for me
in a week.

234
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,114
Eight grand.

235
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,283
Can you get me that?

236
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,453
All right. All right.

237
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,371
Thanks, hon.

238
00:22:55,624 --> 00:23:00,003
Just trying to warn you, that's all.
I mean, that bitch will sell you out.

239
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:04,632
But you really care about me, don't you?
Don't you, Leon?

240
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,718
You care.

241
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:11,056
You know,
you walk an awful thin line, Julie.

242
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,726
I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes.
I mean, you're getting awful cocky.

243
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,394
All the rest of the boys are happy

244
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,689
with a car, house in the hills,
but not you.

245
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:24,986
You got all your rich pussy lined up,
once-a-month tricks,

246
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:29,407
a dip in the pool, a little tennis,
and orgasm.

247
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,410
I'm just trying to warn you as a friend.

248
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,998
If those bitches ever turn on you,
you're through.

249
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:41,461
You're sure about that?

250
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,797
They'll cut you out.

251
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,554
Yeah?

252
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,475
Says she's a friend?

253
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,685
Where does she know me from?

254
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:07,106
Yeah, send her up.

255
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,294
I'm Michelle.

256
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:39,013
- How did you find me?
- It wasn't hard.

257
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,058
Are you surprised?

258
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,653
What do you want?

259
00:26:56,156 --> 00:27:01,953
I would have thought that you'd live
in a place with thick red carpet,

260
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,122
big circular bed
and mirrors on the ceiling.

261
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:05,540
Bordello.

262
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,752
This is my apartment.

263
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,713
Women don't come here.

264
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,095
- You're going out?
- Yeah.

265
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,849
Business?

266
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,601
Maybe.

267
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,563
Isn't it a little late?

268
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:31,190
Isn't it a little late for you?

269
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:35,236
My husband's still in New York.
I'm alone.

270
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,381
I thought it would be easier.

271
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,509
What did you say?

272
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:02,096
I said, "I thought it would be easier."

273
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,015
What would be?

274
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:09,103
To be with you, to procure you.

275
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:12,231
I told you, you're mistaken.

276
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,380
Why are you doing this to me?

277
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,090
What am I doing?

278
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,133
Embarrassing me.

279
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,596
I'm not embarrassing you.

280
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,477
I can't keep up

281
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:55,316
this front much longer.

282
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,154
I came here.

283
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:03,116
I found out who you were,
where you live.

284
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,952
I came here in the middle of the night.

285
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:11,249
I want to know what

286
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:15,002
it would be like to fuck you.

287
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,674
I brought money.

288
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,346
What more can I do? I...

289
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,849
I...

290
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,270
I like...

291
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,859
I don't want to know.

292
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,267
Don't say that.

293
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:15,480
You got me aroused
just thinking about it.

294
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:21,777
I'm lying here with a hard-on,
it's not even 10:00 yet.

295
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:27,575
Don't tease me.
Come on, baby, you're just teasing me.

296
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,245
I'll have to hang up
and jerk off right now.

297
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,663
I am.

298
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,084
Yes, I'm touching myself.

299
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:40,129
You like that, don't you?

300
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:46,010
Come on, baby. Don't say that.

301
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,180
We're lying here getting aroused,

302
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:52,225
talking about having more pleasure
than you've had in years,

303
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:57,396
you got to bring up
some stupid little $1,200 stereo?

304
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:02,860
How much does your husband make?
What's he worth? What's he worth?

305
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,820
A couple of million?

306
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:10,243
Of course I could do without it.
I can listen to the radio.

307
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:12,620
The speaker's cracked.

308
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:17,792
Lisa. Lisa, listen to yourself.

309
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,711
Just listen to yourself.
Do you hear what you're saying?

310
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,381
Can you hold on a second?
Someone's at the door.

311
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,425
Good morning.

312
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,052
What do you want for breakfast?

313
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:32,640
Coffee, orange juice, croissant, eggs?

314
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,685
Julian Kay.

315
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,979
Yeah, I want two coffees,
orange juice, croissant...

316
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,230
No eggs.

317
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:43,359
...one scrambled egg
and a side of cottage cheese.

318
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,611
Lisa, this is really embarrassing.

319
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:47,238
I'm sitting here with a hard-on,

320
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,574
and there's people all over
and I can't talk to you now.

321
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:53,369
All right, I'll see you about 5:00.
Bye-bye, love.

322
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,085
So, what do you think?

323
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,504
About what?

324
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,842
Did you make the right decision
to come here last night?

325
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:12,138
Was it what you expected?

326
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,475
No. It was like really making love.

327
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,438
I'm not used...

328
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,941
That's not what I expected.

329
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,529
Do you remember
what you said last night?

330
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,034
Yes.

331
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:39,373
Now, if I bid on it, I have to buy it, right?

332
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:40,625
Right.

333
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,961
Well, now, the one I want is
right over here. There it is!

334
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:45,046
What does it say?

335
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,756
I saw one just like that in Madam Wu's.

336
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,133
"Jacobean. Late 17th century."

337
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:52,386
It's estimated at $4,800 to $5,200.

338
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:56,098
This has been worked on.
There's glue in it.

339
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,433
Yeah.

340
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,310
I don't know.

341
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:03,689
My guess,
it's gonna go for $5,000, 55 maybe.

342
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,069
It's a great piece,
but it's not a great bargain.

343
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:11,989
Now, 48, that's a good bargain.
What do you think?

344
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:18,537
It's perfect for the guest room,
but I don't know.

345
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:21,749
You know, I saw a George III chest
around here somewhere

346
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,627
going for, like, 22, 23.

347
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,671
It's a lot of money,
but it's a good investment.

348
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,339
Beautiful lines on it.

349
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:33,052
Probably the best bargain is that
tacky garniture set over there,

350
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,845
if the Japs don't bid it up. What is it?

351
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,682
- Do you see who I see?
- Who is it?

352
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,725
It's Randolph Sloan's widow.

353
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,895
- She's a stockholder in Jim's company.
- Is she still alive?

354
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,356
She's gonna make a beeline
straight for us.

355
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:47,358
There goes the garniture set.

356
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,819
- What am I gonna do?
- I don't know.

357
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:56,575
Come, Lisa, we must face the enemy
before they face us.

358
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,161
Lucille!

359
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,915
How lovely to see you.
Are you buying or selling?

360
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,084
- Just looking.
- How nice.

361
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,796
There is an exquisite
garniture set over there.

362
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,507
Lucille, this is Willem Shoenvelt.

363
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,509
He's helping me redecorate
the guest house.

364
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:15,678
Great hospitality, madam.

365
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,474
The dress! Look, the dress.
Beautiful dress.

366
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,810
Goes well with the face.
They're both beige.

367
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:24,311
Willem.

368
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,355
Madam!

369
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,985
- What is going on here?
- I don't know. So sorry.

370
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,486
Willem.

371
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:34,989
Lisa, we must go, auf Wiedersehen.

372
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,876
- Did you see her face?
- I can't believe you did that!

373
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,388
I wish your husband would come back.

374
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:44,266
- He has.
- Good.

375
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,651
I can't stop thinking about you.

376
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,446
Do you mind?

377
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,579
What have you been doing?

378
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,083
- When?
- This morning.

379
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,253
Driving around.

380
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,091
I drove to Anaheim,
then I drove to Long Beach.

381
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:19,760
I pumped my own gas in Long Beach.

382
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:23,013
Then I drove here.

383
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,976
You know, Michelle,

384
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:29,562
I'm really not part of your problems.

385
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,482
And I'm certainly not the solution
to your problems.

386
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,278
I brought money.

387
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,783
Don't...

388
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,120
I don't want your money.

389
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,123
I'll buy you something, then.

390
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,792
I'll buy you that stereo.

391
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,003
I got a stereo.

392
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:56,672
What, then?

393
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:04,805
Come on.

394
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:09,602
- What?
- We're going to my room.

395
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,398
Bulgari. You want it?

396
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,566
No.

397
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:42,736
Good, 'cause you're not gonna get it.

398
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:46,365
Tell me everything about you.
Right now.

399
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,576
God. Why?

400
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,746
I don't know. It seems important.

401
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,333
We just made love, didn't we?

402
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:58,168
Yes.

403
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,255
Then you know everything
there is to know.

404
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,258
That's silly. Where are you from?

405
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,636
No. I'm not from anywhere.

406
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,265
I'm from this bed.

407
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:14,977
Anything worth knowing about me

408
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,771
you can learn from letting me
make love to you.

409
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,941
That's not true.

410
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,987
Why do you sleep with older women?

411
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,533
I prefer older women.

412
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,452
Why?

413
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,540
What's the use of bringing
some high schooler to climax?

414
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:41,545
Some silly teenager gets wet in the
movies and goes home to masturbate.

415
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,132
No challenge.

416
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,260
It has no meaning.

417
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,515
The other night,

418
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,602
that night I met you at the hotel,

419
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,813
I was with a woman.

420
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,649
Somebody's mother.

421
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:06,487
Her husband didn't care
about her any more.

422
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,908
This woman hadn't had an orgasm
in maybe 10 years.

423
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,621
It took me three hours to get her off.

424
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:19,374
For a while there, I didn't think
I was gonna be able to do it.

425
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:26,298
When it was over, I felt like I'd
done something, something worthwhile.

426
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:34,515
Who else would've taken the time
or cared enough to do it right?

427
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:39,978
My God.

428
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,189
These are not the handcuffs
your wife was wearing

429
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,691
when she was killed, Mr Rheiman.

430
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,361
Those we found in the study.

431
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,696
They were in a filing cabinet.

432
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,368
Along with some dildos,
some paddles and some...

433
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,577
You know what I'm talking about.

434
00:40:55,662 --> 00:41:01,333
Listen, your private sex life
is of no concern to me or to the LAPD.

435
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:06,421
However, the manner
in which your wife was assaulted

436
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:11,969
suggests the killer was, may have
been, a guest in your home once.

437
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:16,515
I'll try to keep what you tell me
in the strictest confidence.

438
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:21,145
However, I'm gonna have to have
detailed information

439
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,565
about you and your wife's sex practices.

440
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:30,988
The names of the parties, if any,
that were involved. All right?

441
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:46,420
Sorry. Here you go. And this, too.

442
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:48,630
So I get the Salvation Army.
Thanks a lot.

443
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:50,090
Yep.

444
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,426
Mrs Stewart.

445
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:57,931
Hi, excuse me.
Does Mr Julian Kay live here?

446
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,935
I'm Detective Sunday.

447
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,563
I'm with the Homicide Bureau,

448
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,814
and I'd just like to ask him
a few questions.

449
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:07,274
What do you want?

450
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,194
You're Mr Kay?

451
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,530
Hello, I'm Detective Sunday.
How are you?

452
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,783
Come on.

453
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,620
Look, I'm walking into Westwood.
Do you wanna talk there?

454
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:22,664
- Sure.
- I'll pick that stuff up later, Jill.

455
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,299
I'm investigating the Rheiman murder
from the Los Angeles area.

456
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,968
You heard about the case?

457
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,638
Yeah, that's the one
that was in the paper, right?

458
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:38,889
Yeah.

459
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:42,226
- Palm Springs.
- Right again.

460
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,603
Yeah, I think I read
something about that.

461
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:45,687
Yeah, I bet you did.

462
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,481
- You want a cup of coffee?
- Sure.

463
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:49,650
Listen, we'll sit in the back.

464
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,240
And what were you doing
Tuesday night?

465
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,826
Tuesday.

466
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:02,913
- Or people.
- Tuesday night, I was...

467
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:09,127
I was with a friend at a pre-auction
viewing at Sotheby Parke Bernet.

468
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,171
She'll verify that?

469
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:15,550
We're talking about a woman
of substance here.

470
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,845
- I think she enjoys her privacy.
- I don't want this any more.

471
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,891
...if that's what this is to you, okay?
I don't want it! I don't want it!

472
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,978
Come over here.

473
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:31,024
You can't mix May and December.
It just...

474
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:32,776
Yep.

475
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,362
You like cigars?

476
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,489
I'm sorry.

477
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,824
Am I a suspect?

478
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:40,951
No, no, no, no. But we're gonna
have to check out your alibi

479
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,703
just to be on the safe side,
for your sake.

480
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:46,581
All right, now, this work that you
were doing for the Rheimans,

481
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:50,627
was this as a translator or a chauffeur?

482
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,381
Neither. This was...

483
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,592
This was more of a personal matter.

484
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,761
You're friends?

485
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,097
Not exactly.

486
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:04,891
Not exactly. All right, then.

487
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:07,894
Then what exactly is it

488
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,814
that you were doing with the Rheimans,
or for the Rheimans?

489
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:13,358
Nothing special.

490
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:16,153
Chit-chat. I don't know.

491
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:20,073
I have a hard time
remembering about these things.

492
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:22,451
You know, I meet a lot of people.

493
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:25,620
Yes, yes.
No, I understand your problem.

494
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:27,914
Let's see now, you got there,
you sat around, you had a few drinks.

495
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:30,125
Next thing you know, you're back in LA.
Is that right?

496
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:32,336
More or less.
You want another cup of coffee?

497
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,629
That's bullshit, Julian.
I'm gonna take you in.

498
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:36,089
It'll be good for your memory.

499
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:40,927
You seem like a young man
who needs a little self-improvement.

500
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,933
Look, Mr Sunday...

501
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,227
Detective Sunday.

502
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:52,898
Look, Detective.

503
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:57,861
I want to cooperate with the police
in any way I can, but these...

504
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:01,698
These are very delicate matters.

505
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:07,454
Things that may not fall
under the exact letter of the law.

506
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:11,833
Publicity's the last thing I want.

507
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:14,795
I'm not gonna book you, Julian.

508
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,089
And I'm not gonna take away
your chauffeur's licence.

509
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:21,176
I'm not gonna bring you up on
drug charges. I could do all of that.

510
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,930
Just tell me about the Rheimans.

511
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:30,143
Please welcome Charles Stratton.

512
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:43,573
Mac, thank you.

513
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:47,119
I hope you're having
as good a time as the rest of us,

514
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:51,289
trying to figure out what this stuff is
on our plates.

515
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:53,875
But most of all...

516
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,377
Who's that man up there
who's second from...

517
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:59,673
...I'm happy to have the opportunity
to speak to you in an informal way

518
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:03,009
about the problems
facing southern California.

519
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:06,555
More than any other
community in the country...

520
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:09,516
Do you follow California politics, Julian?

521
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,602
- Not very much.
...we not only use oil and gas...

522
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:14,062
You're smart. They're all whores.

523
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:15,647
...more extravagantly
than any other community,

524
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:19,276
but we also have the technological
means and know-how

525
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:24,114
to help free America
from the grip of fossil fuels.

526
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:27,451
In times of austerity like these,

527
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:31,246
it is the privileged
who should lead the way,

528
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:34,207
who should set an example
for the rest of the country.

529
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,461
- I believe...
- This guy is a real comer.

530
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:39,129
...that example.

531
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,769
So, I said, "What happens
when Mike Curb leaves town?"

532
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:56,021
I'm telling you...

533
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:57,731
Nice of you to come.
You know my wife, Michelle?

534
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,608
She's pretty, isn't she?

535
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:01,151
Yes, very.

536
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,235
Jim, good to see you.

537
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,403
Thank you for coming.
You know Michelle.

538
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:04,821
Glad to meet you.

539
00:47:04,906 --> 00:47:09,242
Mrs Laudner, how nice of you to come.
It's always a pleasure to see you.

540
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:12,329
It's bullshit, but I like it.
Can we talk later?

541
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:14,664
Certainly. Mrs Laudner,
my wife Michelle.

542
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:15,999
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

543
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,083
It's a pleasure to meet you.

544
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,252
- And this is Julian Kay.
- It's an honour to meet you, sir.

545
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:20,921
I enjoyed the speech.

546
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:25,008
Mrs Stratton.

547
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,471
You're a fortunate man, Senator.

548
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,350
Well, you know what he is, don't you?

549
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:37,729
That boy is gonna go far.
Got a nice wife, too.

550
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:39,564
Tell me about them, Frances.

551
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:41,066
Well, I told you he's a comer.

552
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:44,611
No, I want to hear
about them as a couple.

553
00:47:44,946 --> 00:47:48,198
- How is their marriage?
- Julian, you are incorrigible.

554
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,450
No, come on. I mean it.
I wanna hear about it.

555
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,536
I hear she's very unhappy.

556
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,710
How you doing?

557
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:55,825
...really pretty picture...

558
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,997
- Julian!
- Well, hello.

559
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:03,166
What a surprise.

560
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,335
You do a lot of shopping here, maybe.

561
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:08,046
No. I'm just browsing.

562
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:10,298
Just browsing.

563
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:13,968
Well, I gotta go now.
Lot of appointments.

564
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:17,931
It's been very nice talking to you,
Mrs Stratton.

565
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,974
Wait.

566
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,563
I have to talk to you.

567
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:31,820
Yeah. Me, too.

568
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,240
Want to have a drink?

569
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,577
It's kind of early for a drink.

570
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:42,080
Maybe we could get to that
in about an hour.

571
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:43,873
What do you think?

572
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:46,042
I think you're awful.

573
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:49,170
I think you're right. Come on.

574
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,302
I've seen your husband on television.

575
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,347
He's very impressive.

576
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:02,142
What's that supposed to mean?

577
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,481
Nothing. I'm sorry.

578
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:13,486
I would never do anything
to hurt him politically.

579
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:16,865
I could never leave him.

580
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,661
Don't let him blackmail you.

581
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:24,998
He has this big political thing about

582
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:29,002
having a family.

583
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:32,589
He keeps wanting me to be pregnant.

584
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:34,758
What are we talking about?

585
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,552
Are we talking about
what he wants or what you want?

586
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,847
I can't tell any more.

587
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:47,103
What can I do?

588
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,066
I don't know.

589
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:55,028
Be yourself.

590
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:58,406
Leave him?

591
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:02,202
His career will survive.

592
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:05,205
People forget.

593
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:11,044
These things have to be done quietly.

594
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:20,386
Don't let him fool you with his talk
about duty and self-sacrifice.

595
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:25,809
He's getting exactly what he wants.
You've got to do the same.

596
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:29,521
Take your pleasure when you can.

597
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:35,527
How about you? Where do you come in?

598
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,072
How do you get pleasure?

599
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:10,895
What a surprise. Mr Kay.

600
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,481
Detective Sunday.

601
00:53:13,566 --> 00:53:16,568
You are full of surprises.
Come on in. Sit down.

602
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:18,194
Take a shine. You need it.

603
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:21,197
Thank you, Julian.
Well, you're quite dressed up today.

604
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:23,449
Well, I'm going to the country club.

605
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:27,120
To the country club.
We checked on your alibi.

606
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:32,041
Mrs Williams said that you had
been with her Tuesday night.

607
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:38,506
But you dropped her off at 7:00.

608
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:40,675
The Rheiman murder was at 10:00.

609
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,093
Shit.

610
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:46,014
But I described the house.
The bedroom.

611
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:48,558
Yeah, she said you had been
helping her redecorate,

612
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,810
that you had been to Parke Bernet,
picking out a bureau.

613
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:53,062
- Right. Right.
- I can understand why she'd say that.

614
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:54,856
She has a reputation to protect.

615
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:58,151
How do you do it, Julian?

616
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:03,907
This afternoon with Mrs Jarvie
and tonight at the country club.

617
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:07,535
How do you seduce
all these women, huh?

618
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:11,456
I don't like you poking around
in my private life, Sunday,

619
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,375
bugging my friends.

620
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:20,214
I'll tell you what. You lay off my clients,

621
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:22,967
I'll give you a few pointers
picking up women, okay?

622
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:25,011
How's that?

623
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,266
First, obviously, you dress for shit.

624
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:32,185
Anybody can fix that, no problem.

625
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,770
- It's your face.
- Face?

626
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:35,396
Face. Bad face.

627
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:36,940
And your body.
What's wrong with your body?

628
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:39,609
You have back problems?
You look like a monkey sitting there.

629
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:42,403
- Come on.
- Hey, back. Shoulders back. Back.

630
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:45,990
And your jaw, work the jaw.
Exercise. You don't want it slack.

631
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:49,369
- Up tight, tight. Yes.
- Tight. Tight.

632
00:54:50,663 --> 00:54:52,956
Would you be willing
to come in for a line-up?

633
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,711
Sure. Why not?

634
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:00,713
Doesn't it ever bother you, Julian?

635
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:03,299
- What?
- What you do.

636
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:09,472
Giving pleasure to women?
I'm supposed to feel guilty about that?

637
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:11,307
But it's not legal.

638
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:13,351
Legal is not always right.

639
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:16,562
Men make laws.
Sometimes they're wrong.

640
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:19,857
They're stupid,

641
00:55:21,402 --> 00:55:23,236
or jealous.

642
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:25,738
And you know better?

643
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,574
Some people are above the law.

644
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:31,828
Well, how do these people
know who they are?

645
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:33,329
They know.

646
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:37,417
They ask themselves.

647
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:41,587
Eugene, thanks.
I'll take care of you in a minute.

648
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:43,381
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

649
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,592
- May I?
- Please.

650
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:49,762
Yeah, the other one
could use some work.

651
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:54,934
Why didn't you tell me
you handcuffed Mrs Rheiman?

652
00:55:57,438 --> 00:55:59,188
I didn't.

653
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:01,315
Yeah, you said that.

654
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:04,569
That's why I went back and had it
checked it twice with the coroner.

655
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:07,905
Apparently, she must have
put up quite a struggle.

656
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:11,492
There were cuts on her wrists
from being handcuffed.

657
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:14,203
But underneath the cuts
there were bruises

658
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:15,872
from where she was handcuffed earlier.

659
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:19,375
Now the coroner estimates
about 48 hours earlier,

660
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,627
which would be the night
you were there.

661
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:27,467
Jesus Christ.

662
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:32,180
Now, she was beaten
with a heavy metal object,

663
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:35,641
raped and violated with an object,

664
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,477
presumably the murder weapon.

665
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,997
Yeah.

666
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:02,001
Yeah, I handcuffed her.

667
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:07,090
But you gotta understand
about these people,

668
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:09,008
like the Rheimans.

669
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:15,681
It's like a game to them.

670
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,102
I'll explain.

671
00:57:24,817 --> 00:57:26,317
Julian.

672
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:29,362
Yeah? What is it?

673
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,156
They were here two hours, the police.

674
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:33,366
They were here two hours.

675
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,535
I couldn't stop them.
They had a search warrant.

676
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:37,870
It's all right, Jill. It's okay.

677
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:39,664
What's going on?

678
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:12,238
Jill, it's Julian.

679
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,032
No, it's okay. It's okay.

680
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:16,909
Send the maid up now.

681
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,347
Hi. How you doing, Timmy?

682
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:42,143
Julian! You're becoming
a regular visitor.

683
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,936
What's happening?

684
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:47,565
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

685
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:50,109
I don't like to have anybody
in the house when Tim visits.

686
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:53,154
Courts might not let me see him at all.

687
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:56,991
Let's go down to the beach, then.

688
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,474
Watch out.

689
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:24,852
Thank you.

690
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:31,067
I think I'm in a frame.

691
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:33,653
- Who's putting you in?
- I don't know.

692
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:35,988
All I see is a frame.

693
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,659
It's that Rheiman murder.
Out in Palm Springs.

694
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:41,619
You tricked with them?

695
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:44,372
Once. Just once. Favour to Leon.

696
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:48,501
- Two-timing bastard.
- So I'm a nice guy. I can't help it.

697
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,419
You check around for me?

698
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:53,214
Why don't you ask
your new friend Leon?

699
00:59:53,674 --> 00:59:55,174
I may just do that!

700
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:59,845
You trick for other people,
you cheat me out of money,

701
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:03,224
and then when you need a favour,
you come back to me.

702
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:08,271
If I help you, you'll have to help me.

703
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:11,524
How?

704
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:15,403
You'll have to come back to me,
work strictly for me.

705
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:19,532
Wait a minute, now.
No, it's got nothing to do with that.

706
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:21,284
- Like shit it doesn't.
- No.

707
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:22,702
I made you, Julie.

708
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:24,787
I taught you everything you know,

709
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:29,083
how to dress, how to behave,
how to treat women, how to make love.

710
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,793
And then one day
you come to me and say,

711
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,337
"I'm too good for you," and cut me out.

712
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:35,298
It ain't right, Julie.

713
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:39,343
Things are different now.

714
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:40,886
I'm more than what I used to be.

715
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:45,975
I'm getting older, Anne.
I gotta keep moving forward.

716
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:49,270
- Just move.
- Please, Julie, save me the speeches.

717
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:53,858
How's your Swedish coming?

718
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:55,818
I'll be ready.

719
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,237
She's flying in from Stockholm
on Thursday.

720
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:02,074
She apparently has certain
sexual idiosyncrasies.

721
01:01:04,036 --> 01:01:06,537
Are you going to come back with me?

722
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,625
You did it, didn't you?

723
01:01:13,754 --> 01:01:14,837
What?

724
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,423
The Rheiman killing.

725
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,514
Don't worry, Julie.

726
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,224
It doesn't matter.

727
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:39,236
Thank you.
It's been a wonderful evening.

728
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:47,787
- Can I see you again tomorrow?
- How about this one?

729
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:51,207
There was a sexy girl
from Borgan Place...

730
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,629
Do you live alone?

731
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,759
It's such a sweet face.

732
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,144
No, not yet.

733
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:13,813
Why not?

734
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:17,066
- Let's just kiss some more, okay?
- What's wrong?

735
01:02:19,111 --> 01:02:22,321
Nothing's wrong.
I just don't want to make love.

736
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:30,579
I love to be with you.

737
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:35,000
I love it when you kiss me
and when you touch me,

738
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:39,004
but when you make love, you go to work.

739
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:44,635
Look, if it's your period, it's okay.
I don't mind. I love it.

740
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:48,180
Don't give me that crap.
You know what I'm talking about.

741
01:02:48,557 --> 01:02:50,808
I can't give you any pleasure,

742
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:53,519
and you can't fool me any more.

743
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,271
You don't know
what you're talking about.

744
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:58,065
Yes, I do. And so do you.

745
01:03:09,411 --> 01:03:12,204
Yeah, I know.

746
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:17,585
You're talking about me
giving up what I am,

747
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:19,128
what I do.

748
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,714
Is that so shocking?

749
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:31,515
I care about you. I really do.

750
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,191
That's still not enough.

751
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:47,156
It's all I'm good at.

752
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:49,909
That's not true.

753
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:54,455
It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.

754
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:57,708
I can't quit anyhow.
If I quit, I'm out on a limb.

755
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:02,421
Well, then we'd be even.
I'm already out on one.

756
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:10,638
People I know take care of each other.

757
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,101
I need their protection.

758
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:23,359
I'm being framed by somebody.

759
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:25,110
I don't know who.

760
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:30,449
There was a murder, Palm Springs,
a couple weeks ago.

761
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:33,953
Police think I did it.

762
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:36,956
It was a woman.

763
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:39,250
A woman I met once.

764
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:43,546
I wasn't there,
but my alibi completely denies it.

765
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:45,631
Why would anyone
want to do that to you?

766
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:49,176
I can't figure that out. I don't know.
It doesn't make any sense.

767
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,428
When was the murder?

768
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:53,264
A week ago Tuesday.

769
01:04:56,268 --> 01:04:58,602
Weren't we together that night?

770
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:01,313
Baby, I wish we were.

771
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:18,664
All right, boys, stand full-face, please.

772
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,082
This is bullshit. These cops...

773
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:22,793
Number three, take off your glasses.

774
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:28,674
Number two, straighten up.

775
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:31,635
Turn to your right.

776
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:36,807
No, number three, to your right.

777
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:38,350
Jerk.

778
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:40,561
How much you getting paid?

779
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:44,315
What are you talking about?
I'm just a con.

780
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:45,733
So am I.

781
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:47,860
I'm getting 15.

782
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:51,363
- You are?
- Yeah, 15 bucks.

783
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:53,365
Now left, please.

784
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:58,037
Left.

785
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:01,915
Thank you.

786
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:08,213
- The wino's getting 20.
- You're kidding.

787
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:11,842
You ain't getting paid,
you're getting screwed.

788
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:14,970
Shit! What the fuck is going on here?
Is my lawyer here yet?

789
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:16,305
- I want to speak to my lawyer...
- Four!

790
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,681
...when he gets here!
Make sure they call me.

791
01:06:17,766 --> 01:06:20,392
Four. You'll see your lawyer.
Get back in line.

792
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:23,062
Now, just make sure I speak to him.

793
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:25,606
Number one, turn to your right again.

794
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:26,732
I know my rights.

795
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,902
- This isn't Russia.
- Okay, number one, turn to your left.

796
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,488
We have a constitution here.
I know my rights.

797
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:34,239
- Wait till my lawyer gets here.
- All right, thank you.

798
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:35,866
You all can leave now.

799
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,702
How about this fucking jerk here, three?
Is he getting paid?

800
01:06:38,787 --> 01:06:41,330
Hey, you!
Are you getting paid, too, huh?

801
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:43,415
What the fuck is going on?

802
01:06:46,086 --> 01:06:48,045
Well, what do you think?

803
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,383
- Not bad.
- I'm gonna steal your thunder.

804
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:54,718
He's teaching me how to dress.

805
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:58,263
This is Lieutenant Curtis
from Palm Springs.

806
01:06:58,348 --> 01:06:59,556
He's...

807
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:02,685
He's in charge of this case.

808
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:04,937
Wait a minute. I thought you were.

809
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:07,815
No, not me. I'm in charge
of pimps, prostitutes and hustlers.

810
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:11,318
They keep me pretty low on the pole.
Good joke, huh?

811
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:18,617
You've been identified, Julian.

812
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:22,162
- Julian.
- By whom?

813
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:24,873
Who could possibly identify me?

814
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,501
You parked your Mercedes
about 50 feet from the Rheiman house

815
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:30,254
between 9:30 and 10:00
on the night of the 22nd.

816
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:33,882
Then you proceeded up the street,
entered the house.

817
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:37,845
- Someone saw you, Julian.
- I request formal charges...

818
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:40,347
I don't understand. I don't know
who would say this about me.

819
01:07:40,432 --> 01:07:42,808
- Now, he's been apprised of his rights!
- I was not there.

820
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:45,769
Then she identified subject number one.

821
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:50,941
Then she wasn't sure
which one of you it was.

822
01:07:56,156 --> 01:07:58,866
- You got the licence number?
- She didn't see it.

823
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:00,617
- Shit!
- Right.

824
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:02,828
Here.

825
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:07,374
We looked around your house
the other day. We had a warrant.

826
01:08:07,459 --> 01:08:09,835
- We know.
- You recognise these?

827
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:11,545
No.

828
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:13,380
- They were under your mattress.
- So what?

829
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:18,010
They had Mrs Rheiman's fingerprints
all over it. That's so what.

830
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:21,180
- Did you find the jewels?
- What jewels?

831
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:24,683
I read the paper, too.
Jewels stolen from Rheiman's house.

832
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:27,770
Whoever planted that money
probably planted the jewels, too.

833
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:29,688
There were no jewels.

834
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:33,025
Didn't you ever wonder
this whole thing may be a frame?

835
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,860
It occurred to us.

836
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:37,529
It occurred to you.

837
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:40,574
- Did you check out Rheiman himself?
- He has an alibi.

838
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,243
Big deal, he's got an alibi. What about...

839
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:44,620
You're grasping at straws.

840
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:46,580
What about Leon James, the black guy
sent me out to Rheiman's?

841
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:50,292
He spoke very highly of you.
He said you were a high-class act.

842
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:52,211
And what do you think?

843
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:02,221
I think you're guilty as sin.

844
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:04,598
I think you went to the Rheimans',

845
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,810
I think you did a trick,
played some rough games.

846
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:11,355
You got drugged or stupid or both.

847
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:15,692
I think you beat her, you killed her,
stole the money and the jewels.

848
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:21,156
Then there's no use to talk any more
until you press charges.

849
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:25,327
Even though we think Julian's guilty,
we're not gonna arrest him.

850
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:27,287
If you are being framed,

851
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:30,833
you're gonna be a lot more use to us
floating around.

852
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,921
Can we go now?

853
01:09:47,976 --> 01:09:50,102
Just one more thing, Julian.

854
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:55,774
Don't tell cons they get paid for line-ups.

855
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:59,027
Some cops don't have
a sense of humour. You know that.

856
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:01,089
- Hi.
- Yes?

857
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:04,051
I'm here to see Mrs Williams.
My name is Julian Kay.

858
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:06,511
That's all right, Wilma.
I'll take care of it.

859
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,513
- Hi.
- Hello, Julian.

860
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:13,060
- Why are you here?
- Can I talk to you?

861
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:15,020
What do you want to talk about?

862
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:19,691
Were the police here?

863
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:21,610
There was a detective here.

864
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:24,363
I was very surprised you used my name.

865
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,825
I'm very, very sorry about that, Lisa,

866
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:32,371
but this is very important to me.

867
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:34,790
I told him the truth.

868
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:39,586
Lisa, you didn't tell him the truth.
I was with you until after midnight.

869
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:41,463
That's not the truth.

870
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:43,507
Julian, I can't...

871
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,385
You weren't here.

872
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:48,261
What is it, dear?

873
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:50,180
This is Julian Kay,

874
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:53,141
the one who is helping
with the decorating.

875
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:57,312
He's the boy who told the police
he was with me the night of that murder.

876
01:11:57,397 --> 01:11:59,272
So, you're Mr Kay.

877
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:03,360
It's bad enough you made a fool
of my wife at Parke Bernet,

878
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:05,654
but then you start spreading these lies?

879
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,990
- Leave us alone.
- I wasn't lying.

880
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:10,158
I don't know what you did.
I don't want to know.

881
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:12,536
Whatever it is, you're not going
to get out of it by dragging...

882
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:15,414
Truth. I just came here for the truth.
That's all.

883
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:19,710
- I know you're lying.
- How do you know I'm lying?

884
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:24,840
Because I was here with my wife
the entire evening.

885
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:27,509
Thank you, Mr Kay.

886
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,452
You're really not very good at this,
you know?

887
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:37,788
- What?
- Following people, pal!

888
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:39,539
In fact, you're lousy.

889
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:41,208
Who are you?
What are you talking about?

890
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:42,501
Who's paying you?

891
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:45,128
You're not a cop, are you? You can't be.
Leon. It's Leon, right?

892
01:13:45,213 --> 01:13:47,881
- I'm calling the police.
- You want to call? Go ahead, good, call.

893
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:51,259
You want a dime? I'll give you a dime.
What have we got here?

894
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:54,096
- Give me that!
- Floyd... Floyd Wicker. Nice name.

895
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:56,473
Born 7-23-52.

896
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:58,558
Hawthorne Avenue, LA.

897
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:00,811
Driver's licence, American Express,

898
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:03,772
Master Charge, picture of girlfriend...

899
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:07,150
So-so, eyes too close together, Floyd.

900
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:09,277
What else have we got here?

901
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:11,822
We got California State
Congressional Library pass,

902
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:14,908
California State
identification, California...

903
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,620
State senate pass.

904
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:20,997
Senator Charles Stratton.

905
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:24,876
- Who the fuck are you?
- You can read, can't you?

906
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:30,382
Here.

907
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,717
You work for Senator Stratton?

908
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:35,846
Yes.

909
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:41,726
- Why are you following me, Floyd?
- I was told to.

910
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:44,229
- By who? The Senator?
- Who else?

911
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:47,399
If the Senator wanted to know
about my private life,

912
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,776
why didn't he ask me himself?

913
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:54,865
You don't know. You don't know.

914
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:58,577
Well, I'll tell you what, Floyd,
I'm gonna make this easy for you.

915
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:00,704
I'm gonna make it real easy,
so you don't forget.

916
01:15:00,788 --> 01:15:02,747
This is my telephone number.

917
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:07,419
Now you tell the Senator,
if he wants to talk to me,

918
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:11,173
he can just give me a call, all right?

919
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:14,593
Now you fuck off and leave me alone!

920
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,792
I received your message, Mr Kay.

921
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,881
- Thought I'd come see you in person.
- Good evening, Senator.

922
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,549
Yes, I'll have a vodka and tonic,
Charles, please.

923
01:15:54,634 --> 01:15:55,884
Yes, sir.

924
01:15:58,012 --> 01:15:59,888
This is heart-warming.

925
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:04,017
It's nice to see you haven't lost touch
with your constituency.

926
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:07,145
I'm not talking as a senator now.
I'm talking as a husband.

927
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:10,315
That's too bad. I'm not a wife.

928
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:13,652
Very funny.

929
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:16,154
What do you want?

930
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:18,365
Want?

931
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:22,285
I know who you are.
I can't stop my wife from being a fool.

932
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:26,289
But I can stop her
from being blackmailed.

933
01:16:30,795 --> 01:16:32,671
I don't know what you're talking about.

934
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:35,006
You don't?

935
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,385
The police think you're involved
in a murder in Palm Springs

936
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:40,011
a week ago.

937
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:42,472
Three days later,
you saw my wife at a fundraiser

938
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:44,266
and seduced her.

939
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:47,394
You think you can blackmail me
into helping you?

940
01:16:49,689 --> 01:16:51,523
You're crazy, mister.

941
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:53,191
Am I?

942
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:10,000
Last night, my wife asked me
about the Rheiman murder.

943
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:14,129
It didn't make any sense
until I heard about you.

944
01:17:15,089 --> 01:17:17,549
You talked to Michelle about this?

945
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,470
You're not gonna blackmail me!
You can spread...

946
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:24,681
You don't know
anything about this, Mister.

947
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:27,309
But I do know a whore when I see one.

948
01:17:28,269 --> 01:17:29,561
How much?

949
01:17:32,273 --> 01:17:34,357
Not to see your wife again?

950
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:41,072
Five thousand.

951
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:47,454
You'll have the cash in the morning.

952
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:55,170
I'm seeing Michelle
because I want to see her

953
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,590
and because she wants to see me.

954
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:03,595
I don't want a dime from you,
or anyone like you.

955
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:18,443
Let me be even simpler.

956
01:18:19,195 --> 01:18:22,238
You live off the good graces
of a small number of people.

957
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:26,034
Like Mrs Andrews,
who was just at the door a minute ago.

958
01:18:26,577 --> 01:18:29,245
And the good graces of places
such as this.

959
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:32,248
You're just a hanger-on.

960
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:35,710
Unless you want to find a new crowd
to hang on to,

961
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:37,796
don't see my wife again.

962
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:43,236
- Hey, man, how you doing?
- Not bad. How about you?

963
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:46,531
I'm looking for Leon James.
Is he around?

964
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:49,325
Yeah. He's probably at the Probe.

965
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:51,953
Okay. Thanks. Take care.

966
01:20:23,194 --> 01:20:24,569
Hi, Julian.

967
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:19,624
Hey, Jason.

968
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:21,626
Julian, I haven't seen you
in a long time here.

969
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:23,211
What brings you to this
neck of the woods?

970
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:25,004
I'm looking for Leon.
Have you seen him around?

971
01:21:25,089 --> 01:21:26,297
Leon? Yeah, he was here.

972
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:29,425
He was showing off his new little boy.
A cute little blond kid.

973
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:32,220
I think he's over there someplace.

974
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:34,055
- Okay, thanks.
- Yeah.

975
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:55,535
Hey, Julie! I thought that was you.

976
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:56,619
Homecoming?

977
01:21:56,704 --> 01:21:58,454
I've been looking for you. I wanna talk.

978
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:00,081
Let's go out back where it's quiet.

979
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:01,165
Okay.

980
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:03,334
What're you doing here?

981
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:08,131
You coming from a funeral?

982
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:11,926
I hear you're showing off
a new boy here, Leon.

983
01:22:12,011 --> 01:22:15,597
Got to make sure none of these fruits
snatch him from me, too.

984
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:23,104
You heard anything
about the Rheiman killing?

985
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:24,981
That's all I've been hearing about.

986
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:27,859
Cops on my ass like white on rice.

987
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,111
They're giving me
the third degree, Leon.

988
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:32,322
Everybody else, too, Julie.

989
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:37,910
I may need your help.
I don't have an alibi.

990
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:41,372
You're the one that sent me.

991
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:44,751
You need one?

992
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:46,961
Yeah.

993
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:50,006
I'll see what I can do.

994
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,516
Who do you think killed her?

995
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:05,563
Well, if I was the police, I'd be more
interested in Rheiman himself.

996
01:23:05,648 --> 01:23:07,440
He's a freak, you know?

997
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:12,445
Yeah, he's a freak. But he's got an alibi.

998
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:14,030
An alibi?

999
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:19,327
Hey, Julie.
I got something working tonight.

1000
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:20,495
Little thing, you know.

1001
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:23,539
I thought I'd cut you in on it.
If you're interested, let me know.

1002
01:23:23,624 --> 01:23:25,083
Straight?

1003
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:27,043
At this time of night? Are you serious?

1004
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:31,839
Leon, I'm sick of doing your shit.

1005
01:23:31,924 --> 01:23:33,466
I mean, I'm sick of it! No more fag stuff.

1006
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:36,511
No more kink. Nothing. Finito. Got it?

1007
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:38,763
I heard about your problems.

1008
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:41,140
What problems?

1009
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:44,394
Your clientele, Julie. Your rich pussy.

1010
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:48,523
They won't touch you. Say it's too hot.

1011
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:50,358
They're looking for new boys.

1012
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:52,610
Fuck them! Fuck them!

1013
01:23:53,112 --> 01:23:55,113
Hey, Julie, listen.

1014
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:59,325
You ask me
to help you out of a tight spot.

1015
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:01,035
I'm glad to do it.

1016
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:04,997
But I ask you to do my trick,
you tell me no.

1017
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:08,292
Well, how do you expect me
to help you?

1018
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:15,508
You give me the alibi,
and then we'll talk about tricks.

1019
01:24:37,156 --> 01:24:38,281
I have to talk to you.

1020
01:24:38,365 --> 01:24:41,659
Hey, baby! Oh, God!
I'm glad to see you!

1021
01:24:44,997 --> 01:24:47,665
You okay? You better be.
You look so worn out.

1022
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:49,751
I didn't get much sleep.

1023
01:24:50,377 --> 01:24:52,920
- You wanna go for a walk?
- Yeah.

1024
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:55,339
Okay, let me get my shoes.

1025
01:25:00,012 --> 01:25:01,554
What's wrong?

1026
01:25:02,181 --> 01:25:04,348
Are you gonna tell me about it?

1027
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:10,021
Hey!

1028
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:13,441
Hey! You.

1029
01:25:18,864 --> 01:25:20,615
Come on. Tell me.

1030
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:25,286
When I said I didn't want
to make love to you the other day,

1031
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:27,038
I didn't mean it.

1032
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:30,374
I want to fuck you.
I always want to fuck you.

1033
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:43,304
Is that what you came to tell me?

1034
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:44,639
No.

1035
01:25:45,599 --> 01:25:48,810
Charles asked me
to leave for two months.

1036
01:25:49,269 --> 01:25:51,229
Till the primaries are over.

1037
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:52,980
I'm going to Rome.

1038
01:25:57,486 --> 01:25:59,111
Two months.

1039
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:04,992
I'll be back! Wait for me.

1040
01:26:09,706 --> 01:26:11,374
I don't know if I can.

1041
01:26:12,626 --> 01:26:14,544
- The police searched my apartment...
- Maybe Charles could help.

1042
01:26:14,628 --> 01:26:16,754
Don't... That's not what I'm saying!

1043
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:27,932
I don't know what I'm saying.

1044
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:40,319
All my life I've been
looking for something.

1045
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:42,780
I don't even know what it is.

1046
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:45,825
- Let me do it...
- Maybe you're what I'm looking for.

1047
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:53,291
I gave Charles my word.

1048
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:56,043
I've got to go.

1049
01:26:57,421 --> 01:26:59,130
It'll be all right.

1050
01:27:02,342 --> 01:27:03,551
Yeah.

1051
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:05,803
I have to leave.

1052
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:41,662
Shit!

1053
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:14,463
I don't know where he is.
I haven't seen him since yesterday.

1054
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:17,633
- Tell me.
- I don't know. Honest. I'd tell you.

1055
01:33:18,468 --> 01:33:20,928
The police have been here all morning.
His room's a mess.

1056
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:23,681
There's another cop waiting in his room.

1057
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:26,809
- Does he call in?
- I'm not supposed to tell.

1058
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:30,771
Okay, next time he calls in,
tell him that I've got to talk to him.

1059
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:31,939
Tell him it's important.

1060
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:33,190
Ask him if there's someplace
I can meet him.

1061
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:47,871
Do you know a blond kid

1062
01:33:47,956 --> 01:33:49,373
that hangs around
with Leon James?

1063
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:52,042
Nah. Couldn't tell you.

1064
01:33:53,837 --> 01:33:55,713
Eat shit, asshole.

1065
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:09,977
Anne, I'm sorry.

1066
01:34:11,438 --> 01:34:13,355
I've got to talk to you.

1067
01:34:14,065 --> 01:34:16,483
I can't now. I'm looking for somebody.

1068
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:21,030
Perino's? Look, I don't have time! I...

1069
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:23,115
Yeah, all right. All right. Perino's.

1070
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:24,742
Yes. 8:30.

1071
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:40,924
Jill? It's Julian.

1072
01:34:43,094 --> 01:34:46,055
Yeah, I know, I know.
Got some messages for me?

1073
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:51,310
Michelle?

1074
01:34:55,774 --> 01:34:58,067
Tell her to meet me at Perino's.

1075
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:04,531
Son of a bitch, it's Rheiman.

1076
01:35:38,650 --> 01:35:41,235
Mr Julian! You can't come in like this.

1077
01:35:41,444 --> 01:35:42,861
I was working. I forgot my tie.

1078
01:35:42,946 --> 01:35:46,240
- I'll have to give you a jacket.
- No, it's okay.

1079
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,915
Julie. You look like shit. What's wrong?

1080
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:57,042
Everything. Straight bourbon.

1081
01:35:57,627 --> 01:35:58,836
What're you doing to yourself?

1082
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:02,423
The way you look now,
you couldn't get a maid to fuck you!

1083
01:36:02,507 --> 01:36:04,508
Anne, I need your help.

1084
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:06,510
The cops are after me.

1085
01:36:06,594 --> 01:36:07,886
They're framing me
for the Rheiman murder.

1086
01:36:07,971 --> 01:36:09,471
Where have you been?

1087
01:36:09,556 --> 01:36:12,349
- I was looking for somebody.
- Last night?

1088
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:14,935
- What do you mean?
- Mrs Vakklar.

1089
01:36:15,019 --> 01:36:17,187
She came in last night
on a flight from Stockholm.

1090
01:36:17,272 --> 01:36:18,272
And she only speaks Swedish.

1091
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:20,482
Nobody could understand her
and there was no one there to meet her.

1092
01:36:20,567 --> 01:36:21,567
- Anne...
- She was furious!

1093
01:36:21,651 --> 01:36:23,444
The auto people are furious.
Now I've got hell to pay!

1094
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:24,736
Now what happened?
Didn't you prepare?

1095
01:36:24,821 --> 01:36:26,613
Didn't you hear me?

1096
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:29,366
I said the cops are after me!
For murder!

1097
01:36:29,826 --> 01:36:31,702
So, you stand me up?

1098
01:36:33,037 --> 01:36:34,705
Jesus Christ.

1099
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:38,250
What do you want?

1100
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,632
Are you gonna help me?

1101
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:50,429
I've checked around, Julie.
You are in trouble!

1102
01:36:51,890 --> 01:36:53,348
That's why I need your help.

1103
01:36:53,433 --> 01:36:55,392
You never did anything for me.

1104
01:36:56,561 --> 01:36:58,353
I never did anything for you...

1105
01:36:58,438 --> 01:37:01,148
What are you talking about?
I'm your number one boy!

1106
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:03,233
And you fight me every turn.

1107
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:07,571
You ask a favour, and then stand up
a gig I worked for six months to set up!

1108
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:09,406
I explained that already. I told you.

1109
01:37:09,491 --> 01:37:11,033
I'm through with you, Julie.

1110
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:14,036
You'll have to fend for yourself.

1111
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:16,914
I don't care
what happens to you any more.

1112
01:37:30,011 --> 01:37:31,720
Excuse me. I'll be back in a second.

1113
01:37:45,568 --> 01:37:48,028
Julian. Thank God you got my message.

1114
01:37:48,112 --> 01:37:49,738
I've been looking for you all day.

1115
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:52,366
It's all right, baby. It's okay.

1116
01:37:53,159 --> 01:37:56,328
No. No, it's not all right.
Charles talked to the D.A.

1117
01:37:56,412 --> 01:37:59,540
They've found the murder weapon.
They're gonna arrest you.

1118
01:37:59,874 --> 01:38:01,416
That can't be.

1119
01:38:02,794 --> 01:38:04,628
What're you gonna do?

1120
01:38:05,964 --> 01:38:07,756
I don't know.

1121
01:38:12,428 --> 01:38:14,429
What can I do to help you?

1122
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:17,891
- There's nothing you can do.
- There's gotta be something.

1123
01:38:17,976 --> 01:38:20,811
Don't you understand?
I am in big trouble!

1124
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:23,814
- Just stay away from me!
- No!

1125
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:26,316
It's gonna be a scandal.
You know what a scandal is?

1126
01:38:26,401 --> 01:38:28,151
You know what that's like?

1127
01:38:28,695 --> 01:38:31,446
Just stay away from me.
I'll ruin your life.

1128
01:38:31,531 --> 01:38:33,949
Your husband's. It's all over.

1129
01:38:34,033 --> 01:38:35,951
Not if you're innocent.

1130
01:38:37,662 --> 01:38:39,204
If I'm innocent?
How do you know I'm innocent?

1131
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:42,291
- But you are...
- Look at me, right in the face!

1132
01:38:42,375 --> 01:38:46,211
Can you tell me, without hesitation,
you know I'm innocent?

1133
01:38:46,337 --> 01:38:47,462
Yes.

1134
01:38:54,345 --> 01:38:57,306
- You see... Forget me.
- Is someone in there?

1135
01:38:57,432 --> 01:38:59,391
I never loved you.

1136
01:41:15,695 --> 01:41:18,113
- Julie.
- Let me in. It's important.

1137
01:41:22,869 --> 01:41:25,036
Julie, you look terrible.

1138
01:41:25,121 --> 01:41:27,706
Hey, listen, you wanna clean up?
Get a shave?

1139
01:41:27,790 --> 01:41:30,584
I'm sorry to bug you
this time of the morning.

1140
01:41:30,668 --> 01:41:32,544
I've been looking for you.

1141
01:41:34,672 --> 01:41:36,214
I'm listening.

1142
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:41,845
You got my alibi ready?
I'm gonna need it today.

1143
01:41:42,555 --> 01:41:45,098
It's not ready yet, Julie. Tomorrow.

1144
01:41:45,183 --> 01:41:47,017
I'm still piecing it together.

1145
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:50,437
It's not easy, you know.

1146
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:52,230
I'm just trying, you know, to get it right.

1147
01:41:52,315 --> 01:41:55,066
- Why are you trying to frame me?
- What're you talking about?

1148
01:41:55,151 --> 01:41:57,819
Judy Rheiman's murder.
You're behind it.

1149
01:41:58,279 --> 01:42:00,447
You, Rheiman,

1150
01:42:02,074 --> 01:42:05,327
your cute little blond boyfriend
in the bedroom there.

1151
01:42:05,411 --> 01:42:07,329
The one who planted the jewels
in my car!

1152
01:42:07,413 --> 01:42:09,539
I don't know what you're talking about!

1153
01:42:09,624 --> 01:42:10,916
You don't know what I'm talking about.

1154
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,210
What the fuck is that, then?

1155
01:42:14,253 --> 01:42:16,421
He's the one
that actually killed her, isn't he?

1156
01:42:18,966 --> 01:42:22,177
Leon, what happened?
You sent him out there.

1157
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:25,388
You sent him out there, he got into
a scene with Rheiman and his wife.

1158
01:42:25,473 --> 01:42:28,141
He got rough, and he killed her.

1159
01:42:28,226 --> 01:42:30,352
You shut your fucking face!

1160
01:42:30,895 --> 01:42:33,563
I never saw that shit before in my life!

1161
01:42:33,689 --> 01:42:36,358
Look, I wanna know one thing from you.

1162
01:42:36,442 --> 01:42:39,611
How much is it gonna cost me
to get you off my back?

1163
01:42:39,737 --> 01:42:43,073
You ain't talking money,
you're talking murder.

1164
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:45,367
- How much?
- I feel sorry for you, Julie.

1165
01:42:45,451 --> 01:42:46,827
How much?

1166
01:42:48,412 --> 01:42:51,706
It don't make no difference
how much, Julie.

1167
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:55,669
The other side will always pay more.

1168
01:43:13,771 --> 01:43:16,022
You got it on real tight, huh?

1169
01:43:20,945 --> 01:43:23,780
Real proud of yourself,
aren't you, Leon?

1170
01:43:24,448 --> 01:43:28,368
The police found the murder weapon
a block from your apartment.

1171
01:43:29,245 --> 01:43:33,748
And that bitch in Palm Springs
is gonna change her mind anytime now

1172
01:43:33,833 --> 01:43:36,251
and identify you.

1173
01:43:37,461 --> 01:43:40,422
Police want you real bad, Julie.

1174
01:43:41,048 --> 01:43:42,799
Now they got you.

1175
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:04,321
Look, I'm worth maybe 20, 30 grand.
It's yours.

1176
01:44:09,911 --> 01:44:12,203
I'll break in new boys for you.

1177
01:44:15,708 --> 01:44:17,626
I'll work just for you!

1178
01:44:18,169 --> 01:44:20,170
Just for you, Leon!

1179
01:44:20,463 --> 01:44:22,339
40-60 split.

1180
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:24,549
That's fair. 40-60.

1181
01:44:26,135 --> 01:44:27,469
40...

1182
01:44:29,138 --> 01:44:30,722
30-70.

1183
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:34,851
I'll do fag tricks for you.

1184
01:44:34,936 --> 01:44:38,188
I'll do kink.
I'll do anything you want me to do!

1185
01:44:40,399 --> 01:44:43,693
Leave me alone and get out, Julie.

1186
01:44:50,368 --> 01:44:51,660
Why me?

1187
01:44:54,038 --> 01:44:55,747
Why did you pick me?

1188
01:44:58,042 --> 01:45:01,336
Because you were frameable, Julie.

1189
01:45:04,006 --> 01:45:06,716
You stepped on too many toes.

1190
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:09,844
Nobody cared about you.

1191
01:45:10,805 --> 01:45:13,598
I never liked you much myself.

1192
01:45:15,893 --> 01:45:17,727
Now get out.

1193
01:45:23,985 --> 01:45:25,652
Who's down there?

1194
01:45:28,072 --> 01:45:30,865
Your new boyfriend? You motherfucker!

1195
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:32,075
You...

1196
01:45:34,578 --> 01:45:37,497
Oh, my God! Help!

1197
01:45:37,581 --> 01:45:40,500
Listen, don't let me fall!
Please, Julie, help me!

1198
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:43,753
- Don't let me fall!
- Don't fall. Leon, I need you!

1199
01:45:44,839 --> 01:45:46,047
Give me your hand.

1200
01:45:46,132 --> 01:45:49,134
- Try. At least try.
- I can't. I'm trying.

1201
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,678
Help me! Help me, please!

1202
01:45:51,762 --> 01:45:54,848
God! Don't fall!

1203
01:47:10,007 --> 01:47:11,966
Julian, would you
answer a few questions?

1204
01:47:14,136 --> 01:47:16,054
How many times
have you been to Palm Springs?

1205
01:47:17,389 --> 01:47:19,849
How long were you
seeing Mrs Rheiman?

1206
01:47:22,853 --> 01:47:24,604
Any Hollywood notables...

1207
01:47:24,688 --> 01:47:26,231
How much money
have you made, Julian?

1208
01:47:26,315 --> 01:47:27,774
Go ahead and give me
an exclusive, huh?

1209
01:47:27,858 --> 01:47:28,942
Who're you trying to protect?

1210
01:47:29,026 --> 01:47:32,195
- How much did you get for a trick?
- Please. Please. Come on, Julian.

1211
01:47:32,279 --> 01:47:33,780
Is it true you're getting a plea bargain?

1212
01:47:37,868 --> 01:47:40,120
Why would you make a statement?

1213
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:10,984
I wish I had arrested you earlier.

1214
01:48:11,068 --> 01:48:13,027
It would have been easier for everybody.

1215
01:48:13,112 --> 01:48:15,655
You'd better put an end
to this pre-trial publicity.

1216
01:48:16,574 --> 01:48:19,242
We'll be moving him
to Palm Springs soon.

1217
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:23,997
Do you have anything to say, Julian?

1218
01:48:35,342 --> 01:48:36,551
Julian?

1219
01:48:41,432 --> 01:48:42,515
No.

1220
01:49:17,176 --> 01:49:18,676
Hello, Julian.

1221
01:49:20,679 --> 01:49:22,597
Going away on your trip?

1222
01:49:22,681 --> 01:49:24,474
No, I decided not to.

1223
01:49:27,728 --> 01:49:30,647
- Does your husband know you're here?
- No.

1224
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:34,651
Why did you come?

1225
01:49:37,613 --> 01:49:40,657
I didn't think
I was ever going to see you again.

1226
01:49:45,329 --> 01:49:47,330
Don't come back, Michelle.

1227
01:49:55,631 --> 01:49:58,174
Are you satisfied with your lawyer?

1228
01:49:59,677 --> 01:50:01,344
It doesn't matter.

1229
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:04,555
Don't go.

1230
01:50:28,747 --> 01:50:32,125
Michelle Stratton is paying
for my services, Julian.

1231
01:50:32,918 --> 01:50:36,087
I think you know
this is a matter of some secrecy.

1232
01:50:40,759 --> 01:50:42,677
Tell her not to bother.

1233
01:50:42,761 --> 01:50:45,346
Julian, you'll have to help us more.

1234
01:50:48,809 --> 01:50:51,102
You tell Michelle to forget me.

1235
01:50:53,689 --> 01:50:58,776
I'm more worried about your defence,
Julian, than about her private life.

1236
01:51:00,154 --> 01:51:04,240
We'll have to go into all the details
of the night of the murder.

1237
01:51:04,575 --> 01:51:07,785
A maid saw you trying to save Leon,

1238
01:51:07,870 --> 01:51:10,413
so the police are only pressing
the Rheiman case.

1239
01:51:10,956 --> 01:51:14,334
The papers and TV
are trying you already, Julian.

1240
01:51:15,127 --> 01:51:17,879
The police aren't
investigating any more.

1241
01:51:18,255 --> 01:51:19,672
We need some help,

1242
01:51:19,757 --> 01:51:23,301
some facts to get
the investigation going again.

1243
01:51:24,428 --> 01:51:27,347
Then we can find out
about Leon, Rheiman.

1244
01:51:27,431 --> 01:51:28,556
Maybe the blond boy.

1245
01:51:30,559 --> 01:51:32,393
How about it, Julian?

1246
01:51:47,951 --> 01:51:51,496
- Lieutenant Curtis?
- Yes, Mrs Stratton. This is an honour.

1247
01:51:52,164 --> 01:51:53,790
May I sit?

1248
01:51:55,042 --> 01:51:58,086
I was told you wanted to see me.
What can I do for you?

1249
01:51:58,170 --> 01:52:02,465
I want to talk to you about
the Julian Kay/Rheiman murder case.

1250
01:52:03,384 --> 01:52:04,467
Yes.

1251
01:52:04,968 --> 01:52:07,345
I'm paying for Mr Kay's legal defence.

1252
01:52:08,972 --> 01:52:10,473
I know.

1253
01:52:11,475 --> 01:52:14,644
I'm paying for Mr Kay's defence
because I know he's not guilty.

1254
01:52:14,812 --> 01:52:17,230
And I don't want to see
an obstruction of justice.

1255
01:52:17,314 --> 01:52:19,649
How do you know he's not guilty?

1256
01:52:20,401 --> 01:52:23,528
Because he was not in Palm Springs
the night of the murder.

1257
01:52:23,612 --> 01:52:25,321
- No?
- No.

1258
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:27,865
He was with me.

1259
01:52:43,549 --> 01:52:45,508
I told them, Julian.

1260
01:52:46,635 --> 01:52:47,969
I heard.

1261
01:52:50,973 --> 01:52:53,641
You didn't have to do that, Michelle.

1262
01:52:54,435 --> 01:52:56,185
You could have forgotten me.

1263
01:52:56,770 --> 01:52:58,521
I'd rather die.

1264
01:53:03,068 --> 01:53:04,861
What will you do now?

1265
01:53:06,029 --> 01:53:07,655
I don't know.

1266
01:53:08,031 --> 01:53:09,574
I can't go home.

1267
01:53:10,951 --> 01:53:13,161
The newsmen are waiting
outside for me.

1268
01:53:13,245 --> 01:53:15,037
There's dozens of them.

1269
01:53:20,544 --> 01:53:22,211
Why did you do it?

1270
01:53:24,631 --> 01:53:26,382
I had no choice.

1271
01:53:27,384 --> 01:53:29,010
I love you.

1272
01:53:38,395 --> 01:53:40,229
Oh, my God, Michelle.

1273
01:53:42,274 --> 01:53:45,067
It's taken me so long to come to you.
