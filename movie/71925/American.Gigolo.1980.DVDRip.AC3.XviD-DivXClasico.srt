1
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,352
Julian.
You came all the way out here?

2
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,317
I had to leave somebody at the beach.

3
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,358
- It's been weeks.
- Hi.

4
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,873
Hello, girls.

5
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,633
You didn't fly to Rio
for the weekend?

6
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,749
Don't mind them.
They're just jealous.

7
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,718
I've been trying
to reach you all day.

8
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,268
Yeah, I got the message. Number?

9
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,113
Tonight. It's a woman
from Charlottesville.

10
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,510
She's flying in for negotiation
on her husband's estate.

11
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,639
- First time?
- Yeah.

12
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,759
She's meeting lawyers in the morning.
They want a chauffeur.

13
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,950
- Is she into drugs?
- No, no drugs.

14
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,352
1,000, right?

15
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,076
600 for me.

16
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,948
- Don't start this again.
- You want 50/50, get Mike,

17
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,476
or one of those drop-outs
you like so much.

18
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,870
There's no percentage in it
if I don't get 50/50.

19
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,428
You already cut me out of repeaters.

20
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,909
It's only fair. Only fair.

21
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,675
It ain't fair, Julie,
but I don't have any choice.

22
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,548
You got a lot of choice. You can
keep dealing retarded faggots...

23
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,596
Look who's talking!

24
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,910
All right... 50/50.

25
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,394
Who'd you drop off up the beach?

26
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,076
- Wouldn't you like to know.
- Why do you do this to me?

27
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,630
You know anybody else
who gets in the LA Country Club?

28
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,508
And that's not the Hillcrest
or the Riverside or the Riviera.

29
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,558
I gotta run.
Leave the info on the service.

30
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,280
You don't want to take some sun?

31
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,432
I'm sure the girls
would like some company.

32
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,150
No, thanks. No way. See you later.

33
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,196
How's the Swedish coming?

34
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,798
OK.

35
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,758
Do you want me to help you?

36
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,230
Listen to the recording
and repeat what you hear.

37
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,915
Listen and then repeat.

38
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,753
I am not interested in that.

39
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,674
I am not interested in that.

40
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,839
How much farther have we to go?

41
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,839
How much farther have we to go?

42
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,920
Is this your first visit?

43
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,030
Yeah?

44
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,236
OK, let him through.

45
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,276
Hey, Leon, what's up?

46
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,909
Julie, I hate to bug you,
but you gotta help me.

47
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,231
I had this Palm Springs gig
set up for Joey

48
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,072
and he ain't nowhere around.

49
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,154
I can't do it. I'm getting a haircut
I got something on this afternoon.

50
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,276
Baby, this is a two-hour gig.

51
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,157
Plus the drive.

52
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,518
5C, straight in-and-out job.
Nothing fancy. Do me a favour.

53
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,070
I don't know. Maybe.
If I get some time.

54
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,912
I'll give you 50 bucks.

55
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,833
Go fuck yourself.
You think I'm a charity?

56
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,753
Wait a minute.
Who's doing who a favour?

57
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,513
Who called who up, begging for a sub?

58
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,955
OK. I'm sorry. I appreciate it.

59
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,996
Anything for a friend.

60
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,392
Excuse me.

61
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,080
Mind if I take my cap off, ma'am?

62
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,912
No, of course not.

63
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,112
Thank you.

64
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,393
I think I know this hotel
better than my own apartment.

65
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,553
All the important people
come and stay here.

66
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,076
You know,
I used to be a pool boy here.

67
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,475
Anything I can do to help you?

68
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,676
I'll open the champagne for you.

69
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,719
- Open up the...?
- Julian. My name is Julian.

70
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,155
You don't have to open the champagne.

71
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,959
I will give you a tip, don't worry.

72
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,236
Jesus.

73
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,711
I'm sorry, Mrs Tolbin.
That's not what I meant. I was...

74
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,316
I'm sorry.

75
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,312
Is this your first time in LA?

76
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,989
- Maybe you can be a help to me.
- Yeah?

77
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,640
Well, I haven't been here for years,

78
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,349
and I was wondering if there are
any new good restaurants.

79
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,398
You know, where the famous people go?

80
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,914
Yeah, well...

81
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,788
it's probably safer to recommend
the more established restaurants.

82
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:32,035
There's... Ma Maison and La Scala...

83
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,998
Scandia.

84
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,319
And of the newer ones,
I hear that Le Dome is quite nice.

85
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,958
Very popular.

86
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,112
My, you are making me
thirsty just standing there.

87
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,760
Now you can open the champagne.

88
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,349
Pour me a drink...

89
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,396
and set the bottle down.

90
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,829
Yeah, she liked the pool boy bit.

91
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,076
I'm going to see her
again tomorrow afternoon.

92
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,718
Yeah.

93
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,756
OK, Anne. Love you, too.

94
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,398
Paging Mrs Anderson.

95
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,629
Hey, pretty lady.

96
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,950
- Hi.
- Got my other jacket?

97
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,873
- Sure. Here you go, Julian.
- Thanks.

98
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,273
- Good evening, Mr Kay.
- How you doing?

99
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,918
Fine.

100
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,236
Then he has the nerve
to hit on my sister.

101
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,279
No, he's not.

102
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,999
I told you. He's looking right at us.

103
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,671
What'll it be?

104
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,194
No, that's OK, Jimmy.

105
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,196
Mr Kay would like another drink.

106
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,710
- Dry Manhattan on the rocks.
- Yes, sir.

107
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,995
- You speak English.
- You speak English.

108
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,389
- You fooled me.
- And you me.

109
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,040
How long have you
been in Los Angeles?

110
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,031
I live here.

111
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,350
You live here? I don't understand.

112
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,513
You wouldn't. I'm just trying
to refresh my college French.

113
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,958
I usually practise with a friend,
but she's not here yet.

114
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,360
Where are you from?

115
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,829
I was born in Torino,

116
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,309
but I studied at Nantes.

117
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,470
You hardly have any accent at all.

118
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,313
Yeah, I've been travelling too much.

119
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,153
I envy you. I love to travel.

120
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,030
I used to travel a lot, but my
husband's involved in local politics.

121
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,475
So now I just practise French.

122
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,151
He thinks it's chic
to have a bilingual wife.

123
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,598
I think he's right.

124
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,398
Where are you going?

125
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,431
I made a mistake.

126
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,676
My husband's in New York.

127
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,878
What about your friend?

128
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,595
I'm not waiting for anyone.

129
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,916
- You still don't understand.
- Understand what?

130
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,956
Who I am.

131
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,276
Who are you?

132
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,869
You don't even understand
who you are, why you're sitting here.

133
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,836
Why are you here?

134
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,153
- I've got to go.
- All right. Just one thing.

135
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,549
Why did you come on to me?

136
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,552
Like I said, I made a mistake.

137
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,995
I heard you speaking French.

138
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,596
Often in these big hotels, you run
into women from foreign countries

139
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,639
who may need
a translator... or a guide.

140
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,073
And they hire you?

141
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,037
Yes.

142
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,757
How many languages do you speak?

143
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,796
Five or six.

144
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,238
Plus the... international language.

145
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,752
That's right.

146
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,669
Well, now,

147
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,116
you're something really
special, aren't you?

148
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,709
You're one to talk.

149
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,794
I saw you sitting here. You wanted me
to come over. I came over.

150
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,552
I know what I see.

151
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,428
How much would you have charged me?

152
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,909
As what? Translator or guide?

153
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,878
No. Just one fuck.

154
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,473
Now you've made a mistake.
I don't do that.

155
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,677
You don't, huh?

156
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,719
I know what I see, too, Monsieur Kay.

157
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,233
It's been a pleasure talking to you,
Madame Joste.

158
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,478
Look, someone's made a mistake here.
I don't do fags.

159
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,552
- I didn't mean that.
- Or couples.

160
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,438
No, no, no. You don't understand.

161
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,512
It's just my wife Judy. Not me.

162
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,431
Just her.

163
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,277
- But I can watch.
- Of course.

164
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,999
Would you like a drink?

165
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,477
Not yet.

166
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,190
- I think I'd like my money now.
- Sure. Sure.

167
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,959
- I like to talk after.
- Sure.

168
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,595
Hello, Judy.

169
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,389
You're a very sexy lady,
a very good-looking woman.

170
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,589
A very pretty woman. You'll like me.

171
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,592
I can tell...

172
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,678
because I like you. I like you.

173
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,594
So just relax and close your eyes.

174
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,478
Just relax
and let your mind run free.

175
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,195
Don't worry about anything.

176
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,716
I can take care of you.
I know what you want.

177
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,870
That's right. Close your eyes.

178
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,432
Forget about him.
This is just you and me.

179
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,557
No, no, no, from behind.

180
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,279
It has to be from behind.

181
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,596
Ok, baby, just flip over
on your stomach.

182
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,871
Just relax. Don't worry.
Leave everything to me,

183
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,509
'cause I'm going to take care of you.

184
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,674
I'm going to get you wet, very wet.

185
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,512
I know how to do this.

186
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,038
Now slap her.

187
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,513
Slap that cunt.

188
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,989
- Hey, Leon.
- How you doing, Jule?

189
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,918
I want to thank you
for helping me out, Julie.

190
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,118
Finally found Joey holed up
with one of his... boyfriends,

191
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,159
just banging away,
you know how it is. Dumb bastard.

192
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,789
- Hello, Julian.
- Hi. I'll just have a Perrier.

193
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,790
You made quite a hit in Palm Springs.
They want you back.

194
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,553
I'm serious.
They want you back this week.

195
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,675
I wouldn't take much,
you know. It's...

196
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,193
They're regulars for me.

197
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,153
You lied, Leon.
It was a rough trick.

198
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,954
I forgot. You got scruples now, huh?

199
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,116
I don't like playing
the same numbers too often.

200
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,634
They get possessive.

201
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,111
- I can't be possessed.
- Does that include Miss Anne?

202
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,952
Anne who?

203
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,033
I don't know why you fool around
with that dumb bitch.

204
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:47,353
I'll tell you why, Leon. She's got
a job coming up for me in a week.

205
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,237
Eight grand.

206
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,914
Can you get me that?

207
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,434
All right. All right.

208
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,636
Thanks, hon.

209
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,671
Just trying to warn you, that's all.
That bitch will sell you out.

210
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,878
But you really care about me,
don't you? Don't you, Leon?

211
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,916
You care.

212
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,032
You know, you walk
an awful thin line, Julian.

213
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,669
I wouldn't want to be in your shoes.
You're getting cocky.

214
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,072
The other boys are happy,
with a car, a house, but not you.

215
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:26,359
You got all your rich pussy lined up,
once-a-month tricks,

216
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,150
a dip in the pool,
a little tennis, and orgasm.

217
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,834
I'm just to warning you as a friend.

218
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,118
If those bitches ever turn on you,
you're through.

219
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,833
You're sure about that?

220
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,150
They'll cut you out.

221
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,792
Yeah?

222
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,471
Says she's a friend?

223
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,551
Where does she know me from?

224
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,950
Yeah, send her up.

225
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,830
I'm Michelle.

226
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,515
- How did you find me?
- It wasn't hard.

227
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,556
Are you surprised?

228
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,676
What do you want?

229
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,632
I would have thought that you'd live
in a place with thick red carpet,

230
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,030
- big bed, mirrors on the ceiling...
- Bordello.

231
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,550
This is my apartment.
Women don't come here.

232
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,596
- You're going out?
- Yeah.

233
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,635
Business?

234
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,555
- Maybe.
- Isn't it a little late?

235
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,838
- Isn't it late for you?
- My husband's still in New York.

236
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,478
I'm alone.

237
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,593
I thought it would be easier.

238
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,432
What did you say?

239
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,193
I said I thought it would be easier.

240
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,838
What?

241
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,352
To be with you, to procure you.

242
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,595
I told you, you're mistaken.

243
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,188
Why are you doing this to me?

244
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,431
- What am I doing?
- Embarrassing me.

245
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,630
I'm not embarrassing you.

246
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,670
I can't keep up...

247
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,797
this front much longer.

248
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,916
I came here.

249
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,798
I found out who you were,
where you lived.

250
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,270
I came here
in the middle of the night.

251
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,598
I wanted to know what...
it would be like... to fuck you.

252
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,670
I brought money.

253
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,799
What more can I do? I...

254
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,233
I...

255
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,353
I like...

256
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,756
I don't want to know.

257
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,356
Don't say that.

258
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,832
You got me aroused
just thinking about it.

259
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,878
I'm lying here with a hard-on,
it's not even 10:00 yet.

260
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,716
Don't tease me.
Come on, baby, you're teasing me.

261
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,590
I'm gonna have to hang up
and jerk off right now. I am.

262
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:23,479
Yeah, I'm touching myself.
You like that, don't you?

263
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,792
Oh, come on, baby. Don't say that.

264
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,079
We're talking about having more
pleasure than you've had in years,

265
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:40,473
you got to bring up
some stupid little $1,200 stereo?

266
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,592
How much does your husband make?
What's he worth?

267
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,069
A couple of million?

268
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,914
Of course I could do without it.
I can listen to the radio.

269
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,956
The speaker's cracked.

270
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,712
Lisa. Lisa, listen to yourself.
You know what you're saying?

271
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,357
Can you hold on a second?
Somebody's at the door.

272
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,271
Good morning.

273
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:14,993
What do you want for breakfast?
Coffee, juice, croissant, eggs?

274
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,991
Julian Kay.

275
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,196
I want two coffee,
orange juice, croissant...

276
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,474
No eggs.

277
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,599
...one scrambled egg
and a side of cottage cheese.

278
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:29,959
Lisa, I'm here with a hard-on,
people all over, I can't talk.

279
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,117
I'll see you about 5:00. Bye-bye.

280
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,110
So, what do you think?

281
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,276
About what?

282
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,150
Did you make the right decision
to come here last night?

283
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,759
Was it what you expected?

284
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,877
No. It was like really making love.

285
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,630
I'm not used...

286
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,515
It's not what I expected.

287
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,878
Do you remember
what you said last night?

288
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,271
Yes.

289
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,878
Now, if I bid, I have to buy it.

290
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,188
Right.

291
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,636
The one I want is over here.
There it is.

292
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,154
What does it say?

293
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:30,951
"Jacobean, late 17th century".
Estimated at 4,800 to 5,200.

294
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,278
This has been worked on.
There's glue in it.

295
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,873
Yeah.

296
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:41,717
I don't know. My guess is this
is gonna go for 5,000. 55 maybe.

297
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,194
It's a great piece,
but it's not a great bargain.

298
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,158
At 48, that's a bargain.
What do you think?

299
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,839
It's perfect for the guest room,
but I... don't know.

300
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:01,438
I saw a George III chest around here
somewhere, going for, like, 22, 23.

301
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,149
It's a lot, but a good investment.
Beautiful lines on it.

302
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,597
Probably the best bargain is that
tacky garnisher set over there...

303
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,990
- What is it?
- Do you see who I see?

304
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,958
- Who is it?
- It's Randolph Sloan's widow.

305
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,952
- A stockholder in Jim's company.
- She's still alive?

306
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,349
She's gonna make a beeline for us.

307
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,351
There goes the garnisher set.

308
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,750
- What am I gonna do?
- I don't know.

309
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,834
Come, Lisa, we must face the enemy
before they face us.

310
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,071
Lucille!

311
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,311
How lovely to see you.
Are you buying or selling?

312
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,960
- Just looking.
- Oh, how nice!

313
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,998
There is an exquisite
garnisher set over there!

314
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,389
Lucille,
this is Wilhelm Schoenfeld.

315
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,550
He's helping me redecorate
the guest house.

316
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,710
Great hospitality, madame.

317
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,758
Oh, the dress! Look, the dress.

318
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,718
Beautiful dress. It goes
with her face. They're both beige.

319
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,755
Wilhelm.

320
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,475
Madame!

321
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,677
- What is going on here?
- I don't know. So sorry.

322
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,512
Lisa, we must go.

323
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,111
Did you see her face?

324
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,158
Come on.

325
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,232
I wish your husband would come back.

326
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,356
- He has.
- Good.

327
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,554
I can't stop thinking about you.

328
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,196
Do you mind?

329
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,633
What have you been doing?

330
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,831
- When?
- This morning.

331
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,229
Driving around.

332
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,029
I drove to Anaheim,
then I drove to Long Beach.

333
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,714
I pumped my own gas in Long Beach.

334
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,075
Then I drove here.

335
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,430
You know, Michelle,

336
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,478
I'm really not part of your problems.

337
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,313
I'm certainly not the solution
to your problems.

338
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,152
I brought money.

339
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,559
Don't...

340
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,637
I don't want your money.

341
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,320
I'll buy you something, then.

342
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,075
- I'll buy you that stereo.
- I got a stereo.

343
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,553
What, then?

344
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,515
Come on.

345
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,276
- What?
- We're going to my room.

346
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,317
- You want it?
- No.

347
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,358
Good, 'cause you're
not gonna get it.

348
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,153
Tell me everything about you.
Right now.

349
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,994
God. Why?

350
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,152
I don't know. It seems important.

351
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,629
We just made love, didn't we?

352
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,517
Yes.

353
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,512
Then you know everything
there is to know.

354
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,512
That's silly. Where are you from?

355
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,160
I don't know. I'm not from anywhere.

356
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,636
I'm from this bed.

357
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,912
Anything worth knowing, you can learn
by letting me make love to you.

358
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,237
That's not true.

359
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,835
Why do you sleep with older women?

360
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,954
I prefer older women.

361
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,554
Why?

362
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,394
What's the use of bringing
some high-schooler to climax?

363
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,678
Some silly teenager gets wet in the
movies and goes home to masturbate.

364
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,155
No challenge.

365
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,196
It has no meaning.

366
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,950
The other night...

367
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,998
That night I met you
at the hotel...

368
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,196
I was with a woman...

369
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,078
Somebody's mother.

370
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,194
Her husband didn't care
about her any more.

371
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,840
She hadn't had an orgasm in 10 years.

372
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,674
Took me 3 hours to get her off.

373
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,036
For a while,
I didn't think I could do it.

374
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,794
When it was over, I felt
like I'd done something worthwhile.

375
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,950
Who else would've taken the time
or cared enough to do it right?

376
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,159
My God.

377
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,472
These are not the handcuffs your wife
was wearing when she was killed.

378
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,199
Those we found in the study.

379
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,396
They were in a filing cabinet...

380
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,514
along with some dildos, paddles...
You know what I'm talking about.

381
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:20,038
Your private sex life is
of no concern to me or to the LAPD.

382
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,192
However, the manner
in which your wife was assaulted

383
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:29,877
suggests the killer may have
been a guest in your home once.

384
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,397
I'll try to keep what you tell me
in the strictest confidence.

385
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,235
However, I'll have to have
detailed information

386
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,869
about you and your
wife's sex practices...

387
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,397
and the names of any parties
that were involved. All right?

388
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,909
Sorry. Here you go. This, too.

389
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,434
I get the Salvation Army.

390
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,517
Mrs Stewart.

391
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,680
Hi. Excuse me.
Does Mr Julian Kay live here?

392
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,513
I'm Detective Sunday.

393
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,070
I'm with the homicide bureau.
I'd like to ask him a few questions.

394
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,993
What do you want?

395
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,275
You're Mr Kay?

396
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,716
Hello, I'm Detective Sunday.
How are you?

397
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,030
Come on.

398
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,509
I'm walking into Westwood.
You want to talk there?

399
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,558
- Sure.
- I'll pick that stuff up later.

400
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,391
I'm investigating the Rheiman murder
from the Los Angeles area.

401
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,436
You heard about the case?

402
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,830
- Yeah. It was in the paper, right?
- Yeah.

403
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,388
- Palm Springs.
- Right again.

404
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,438
- Yeah, I read about that.
- I bet.

405
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,351
- Cup of coffee?
- Sure!

406
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,510
We'll sit in the back.

407
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,594
Now, what were you doing
Tuesday night?

408
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,233
Tuesday.

409
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,675
Tuesday night, I was...

410
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,709
I was with a friend
at a pre-auction viewing.

411
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,189
She'll verify that?

412
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,751
We're talking about a woman
of substance here.

413
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,752
I think she enjoys her privacy.

414
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:36,630
...if that's what this is
to you. OK? I don't want it!

415
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,948
Come over here.

416
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,471
You can't mix May and December.
It just never...

417
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,837
Maybe she likes the guy, huh?

418
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,592
- I'm sorry.
- Am I a suspect?

419
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,229
No, but we'll have to check
your alibi for your sake.

420
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,393
Now, this work that you were
doing for the Rheimans,

421
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,109
was this as a translator
or a chauffeur?

422
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,670
Neither. This was...

423
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,832
This was more of a personal matter.

424
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,799
- You're friends?
- Not exactly.

425
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,150
Not exactly. All right, then.

426
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,836
What exactly is it
that you were doing for the Rheimans?

427
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,276
Nothing special.

428
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,078
Chit-chat. I don't know.

429
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:32,231
I have a hard time remembering
these things. I meet a lot of people.

430
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,471
Yes, yes.
No, I understand your problem.

431
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:39,439
You got there, you had a few drinks.
Next thing, you're back in LA?

432
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,829
More or less.
You want another cup of coffee?

433
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,151
That's bullshit. I'm taking you in.
It'll be good for your memory.

434
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:49,836
You seem like a young man
who needs a little self-improvement.

435
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,951
Look, Mr Sunday...

436
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,996
Detective Sunday.

437
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,234
Look, Detective...

438
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:07,599
I want to cooperate with the police
in any way I can, but these...

439
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,114
these are very delicate matters...

440
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,791
things that may not fall
under the exact letter of the law.

441
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,470
Publicity's the last thing I want.

442
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,469
I'm not gonna book you or
take away your chauffeur's license.

443
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,270
I'm not gonna bring you up on drug
charges. I could do all of that.

444
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,316
Just tell me about the Rheimans.

445
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,231
Please welcome Charles Stratton.

446
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,991
Mack, thank you.

447
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,595
I hope you're having
as good a time as us...

448
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:58,879
trying to figure out
what the stuff is on our plates.

449
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,396
But most of all,
I'm happy to have the opportunity

450
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,631
to speak to you in an informal way

451
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,951
about the problems
facing southern California.

452
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,635
More than any other
community in the country...

453
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,359
Do you follow
California politics, Julian?

454
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,749
Not very much.

455
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,593
You're smart. They're all whores.

456
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,389
...but we also have the technological
means and know-how

457
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,837
to help free America
from the grip of fossil fuels.

458
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,356
In times of austerity like these,

459
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:36,035
it is the privileged
who should lead the way,

460
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,430
who should set an example
for the rest of the country.

461
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,592
This guy is a real comer.

462
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,758
She's pretty, isn't she?

463
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,512
Yes, very.

464
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,273
Jim, Thank you for coming.
You know Michelle.

465
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,870
Mrs Laudner, how nice of you to come.
It's a pleasure to see you.

466
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,235
Bullshit. Can we talk later?

467
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,153
Certainly. Mrs Laudner,
my wife Michelle.

468
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,468
How do you do?

469
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,951
- And this is Julian Kay.
- It's an honour. Enjoyed the speech.

470
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,756
Mrs Stratton.

471
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,470
You're a fortunate man, Senator.

472
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,270
- You know what he is.
- That boy will go far.

473
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,669
Got a nice wife, too.

474
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,832
- Tell me about them.
- I told you he's a comer.

475
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,674
No. I want to hear
about them as a couple.

476
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,877
- How is their marriage?
- Julian, you are incorrigible!

477
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,190
No, I want to hear about it.

478
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,236
I hear she's very unhappy.

479
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,958
- Julian!
- Well, hello.

480
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,315
What a surprise.

481
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,837
- You do a lot of shopping here?
- No. Just browsing.

482
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,558
Just browsing.

483
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,314
Well, I gotta go.
Lot of appointments.

484
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,075
Been very nice talking to you...
Mrs Stratton.

485
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,957
Wait.

486
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,631
I have to talk to you.

487
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,553
Yeah. Me, too.

488
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,556
Want to have a drink?

489
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,000
It's kind of early for a drink.

490
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:38,198
Maybe we do that in about an hour.
What do you think?

491
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,236
I think you're awful.

492
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,117
I think you're right.

493
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,553
Come on.

494
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,114
I've seen your husband
on television.

495
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,799
He's very impressive.

496
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,836
What's that supposed to mean?

497
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,668
Nothing. I'm sorry.

498
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,718
I would never do anything
to hurt him politically.

499
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,071
I could never leave him.

500
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,515
Don't let him blackmail you.

501
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,797
He has this big
political thing about...

502
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,838
having... a family.

503
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,238
He keeps wanting me to be pregnant.

504
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:30,678
What are we talking about here?
What he wants or what you want?

505
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,230
I can't tell any more.

506
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,877
What can I do?

507
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,951
I don't know.

508
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,109
Be yourself.

509
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,031
Leave him?

510
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,192
His career will survive.

511
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,157
People forget.

512
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,678
These things have to
be done quietly.

513
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:11,996
Don't let him fool you with his talk
about duty and self-sacrifice.

514
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:16,915
He's getting exactly what he wants.
You've got to do the same.

515
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,468
Take your pleasure when you can.

516
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,958
How about you? Where do you come in?

517
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,157
How do you get pleasure?

518
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,630
What a surprise. Mr Kay.

519
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,631
Detective Sunday.

520
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,757
You are full of surprises.
Come on in. Sit down.

521
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:09,152
- Take a shine. You need it.
- Thank you. You're dressed up today.

522
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,071
I'm going to the country club.

523
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,948
To the country club.
We checked on your alibi.

524
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:19,830
Mrs Williams said you had
been with her Tuesday night.

525
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,156
But...

526
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,629
you dropped her off at 7:00.

527
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,915
The Rheiman murder was at 10:00.

528
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,035
Shit.

529
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,030
I described the house, the bedroom.

530
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,236
She said
you were helping her redecorate

531
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,754
and you'd been picking
out a bureau...

532
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,991
I understand why.
She has a reputation to protect.

533
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,551
How do you do it, Julian?

534
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:50,192
This afternoon with Mrs Jarvey
and tonight at the country club.

535
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,909
How do you seduce
all these women, huh?

536
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,913
I don't like you poking around
in my private life, Sunday...

537
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,514
bugging my friends.

538
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,517
I'll tell you what.
You lay off my clients,

539
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,592
I'll give you a few pointers
picking up women.

540
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,512
How's that?

541
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,433
First, obviously, you dress for shit.

542
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:20,230
Anybody can fix that, no problem.
It's your face. Bad face.

543
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:24,154
And that body? You have back
problems? You look like a monkey.

544
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,879
Hey, back. Shoulders back.

545
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,396
And your jaw, work the jaw.
Exercise. You don't want it slack.

546
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,914
Up tight, tight. Tight, yes.

547
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,351
Would you be willing
to come in for a line-up?

548
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,630
- Sure. Why not?
- Doesn't it ever bother you, Julian?

549
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,870
- What?
- What you do.

550
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,672
Giving pleasure to women?
I'm supposed to feel guilty?

551
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:57,276
- But it's not legal.
- Legal is not always right.

552
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,477
Men make laws.
Sometimes they're wrong.

553
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:05,998
They're stupid... or jealous.

554
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,116
And you know better?

555
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,390
Some people are above the law.

556
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,392
How do these people
know who they are?

557
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,879
They know.

558
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,153
They ask themselves.

559
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,676
Eugene, thanks.
I'll take care of you in a minute.

560
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,829
Yes, sir.

561
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,192
- May I?
- Please.

562
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,317
Yeah, the other one
could use some work.

563
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,838
Why didn't you tell me
you handcuffed Mrs Rheiman?

564
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,799
- I didn't.
- Yeah, you said that.

565
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,440
That's why I checked twice
with the coroner.

566
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,956
Apparently, she must have
put up quite a struggle.

567
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,350
There were cuts on her wrists
from being handcuffed.

568
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:56,718
Underneath the cuts were bruises from
where she was handcuffed earlier.

569
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,997
The coroner estimates
about 48 hours earlier,

570
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,435
which would be the night
you were there.

571
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,069
Jesus Christ.

572
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,197
She was beaten with
a heavy metal object,

573
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,352
raped and violated... with an object,

574
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,192
presumably the murder weapon.

575
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,032
Yeah.

576
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,314
Yeah, I handcuffed her.

577
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:47,798
But you gotta understand about
these people... like the Rheimans.

578
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,076
It's like a game to them.

579
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,633
I'll explain.

580
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,353
Julian.

581
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,352
Yeah? What is it?

582
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,556
They were here two hours...
the police.

583
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:13,519
They were here two hours.
They had a search warrant.

584
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,272
It's all right. It's OK.

585
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,032
What's going on?

586
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,040
Jill, it's Julian.

587
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,951
No, it's OK, it's OK.

588
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,792
Send the maid up now.

589
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,919
Hi. How you doing, Timmy?

590
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,994
Julian! You're becoming
a regular visitor. What's happening?

591
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,310
There's something
I want to talk about.

592
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,039
I don't like anybody
here when Tim visits.

593
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:28,636
Courts might not
let me see him at all.

594
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,029
Let's go down to the beach, then.

595
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,435
Watch out.

596
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,997
Thank you.

597
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,430
I think I'm in a frame.

598
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,512
- Who's putting you in?
- I don't know.

599
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,989
All I see is a frame.

600
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,878
It's that Rheiman murder
out in Palm Springs.

601
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,030
You tricked with them?

602
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,918
Once. Just once. Favour to Leon.

603
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,390
- Two-timing bastard.
- I'm nice. I can't help it.

604
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,198
You check around for me?

605
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,999
Why don't you ask
your new friend Leon?

606
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,469
I may just do that.

607
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:31,075
You trick for other people,
cheat me out of money,

608
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:35,199
and then when you need a favour,
you come back to me.

609
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:40,029
If I help you...
you'll have to help me.

610
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,069
How?

611
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:46,870
You'll have to come back to me,
work strictly for me.

612
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,032
Wait a minute.
It's got nothing to do with that.

613
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:53,271
Like shit it doesn't.
I made you, Julie.

614
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,875
I taught you everything you know,
how to dress, how to behave,

615
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,235
how to treat women, how to make love.

616
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:03,438
Then you say, "I'm too good for you,"
and cut me out.

617
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,909
It ain't right, Julie.

618
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,271
Things are different.
I'm more than I used to be.

619
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:16,072
I'm getting older, Anne.
I got to keep moving forward.

620
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,118
Please, Julie, save me the speeches.

621
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:24,753
- How's your Swedish coming?
- I'll be ready.

622
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,910
She's flying in
from Stockholm on Thursday.

623
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,393
She apparently has certain
sexual idiosyncrasies.

624
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,790
Are you going to come back with me?

625
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,873
- You did it, didn't you?
- What?

626
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,918
The Rheiman killing.

627
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:56,036
Don't worry, Julie.
It doesn't matter.

628
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,679
Thank you.
It's been a wonderful evening.

629
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,229
- Can I see you again tomorrow?
- How about this one?

630
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,949
There was a sexy
girl from Borgan Place...

631
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,756
Do you live alone?

632
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,429
It's such a sweet face.

633
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,678
- No, not yet.
- Why not?

634
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,832
- Let's just kiss some more, OK?
- What's wrong?

635
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,798
Nothing's wrong. I just don't...
want to make love.

636
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,793
I love to be with you.

637
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,509
I love it when you kiss me
and when you touch me,

638
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,558
but when you make love,
you go to work.

639
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,275
If it's your period, I don't mind.

640
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,352
Don't give me that.
You know what I'm talking about.

641
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,670
I can't give you any pleasure,

642
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:17,672
and you can't fool me any more.

643
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,751
You don't know what you're saying.

644
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,798
Yes, I do... and so do you.

645
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:36,430
Yeah, I know.

646
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:42,353
You're talking about me giving up
what I am, what I do.

647
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,196
Is that so shocking?

648
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,833
I care about you. I really do.

649
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:03,114
That's still not enough.

650
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,476
It's all I'm good at.

651
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,516
That's not true.

652
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:17,150
It doesn't matter.
I can't quit anyway.

653
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,676
If I quit, I'm out on a limb.

654
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,435
Well, then we'd be even.
I'm already out on one.

655
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,112
People I know
take care of each other.

656
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,589
I need their protection.

657
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:45,916
I'm being framed by somebody.
I don't know who.

658
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,719
There was a murder, Palm Springs,
a couple weeks ago.

659
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,791
Police think I did it.

660
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:58,711
It was a woman. A woman I met once.

661
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,398
I wasn't there,
but my alibi completely denies it.

662
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:07,439
- Why would anyone do that to you?
- I can't figure that out.

663
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,876
- It doesn't make any sense.
- When was the murder?

664
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,030
A week ago Tuesday.

665
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:20,191
- Weren't we together that night?
- Baby, I wish we were.

666
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,795
All right,
boys, stand full-face, please.

667
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,393
This is bullshit. These cops...

668
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,040
Number three, take off your glasses.

669
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,876
Number two, straighten up.

670
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,518
Turn to your right.

671
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,235
No, Number three, to your right.

672
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,514
Jerk.

673
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,556
How much you getting paid?

674
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,871
What are you talking about?
I'm just a con.

675
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,509
So am I. I'm getting 15.

676
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,313
- You are?
- Yeah. 15 bucks.

677
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,231
Now left, please.

678
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,039
Left.

679
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:17,873
Thank you.

680
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:24,709
- The wino's getting 20.
- You're kidding.

681
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,758
You ain't getting paid,
you're getting screwed.

682
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,195
Shit! What the fuck's going on?

683
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:33,078
I want to speak to my lawyer!

684
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,754
You'll see your lawyer.
Get in line.

685
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,956
Make sure I speak to him.

686
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:41,350
Number one, turn to your right.

687
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:45,797
I know my rights. This isn't Russia.
We have a constitution here.

688
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:50,510
- I know my rights.
- Thank you. You can leave now.

689
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,478
How about this fuckin' jerk
here, three.

690
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:57,394
You getting paid, too?
What the fuck is going on?

691
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:03,352
Well, what do you think?

692
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,750
- Not bad.
- I'm gonna steal your thunder.

693
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,149
He's teaching me how to dress.

694
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,993
This is Lieutenant Curtis
from Palm Springs.

695
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,877
He's...

696
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:18,238
- He's in charge of this case.
- Wait a minute. I thought you were?

697
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:21,915
No, I'm in charge
of pimps, prostitutes and hustlers.

698
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,675
Pretty low on the pole.
Good joke, huh?

699
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,798
You've been identified, Julian.

700
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,236
- Julian.
- By whom?

701
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,834
Who could possibly identify me?

702
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,878
You parked 50 feet
from the Rheiman house

703
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,916
around 10:00 on the 22nd,

704
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,356
proceeded up the street
and entered the house.

705
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:50,910
- Someone saw you.
- I request formal charges...

706
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,959
I don't understand.
Who would say this? I was not there.

707
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:58,237
Then she identified
subject number one.

708
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:03,108
Then she wasn't sure
which one of you it was.

709
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:10,673
- You got the license number?
- She didn't see it.

710
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,512
- Shit!
- Right.

711
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,033
Here.

712
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:18,590
We looked around your house.
We had a warrant.

713
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:21,148
- We know.
- You recognise these?

714
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:24,357
- They were under your mattress.
- So what?

715
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:28,752
They had Mrs Rheiman's fingerprints
all over them. That's so what.

716
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:31,798
- Did you find the jewels?
- What jewels?

717
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:35,190
I read the paper, too.
Jewels stolen from Rheiman's house.

718
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,192
Whoever planted that money
probably planted the jewels.

719
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:39,838
There were no jewels.

720
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,310
Didn't you ever wonder
this may be a frame?

721
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:47,109
- It occurred to us.
- It occurred to you.

722
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,590
- Did you check Rheiman?
- He has an alibi.

723
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:54,309
- Big deal.
- You're grasping at straws.

724
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,073
What about Leon James, the black guy?

725
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:01,517
- He said you were high-class.
- What do you think?

726
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,235
I think you're guilty as sin.

727
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:14,073
I think you went to the Rheimans',

728
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,993
did a trick,
played some rough games.

729
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,913
You got drugged or stupid or both.

730
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,073
You beat her, killed her,
stole the money and the jewels.

731
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:29,234
Then there's no use talking further
until you press charges.

732
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:33,233
Whether we think Julian's guilty...
we're not going to arrest him.

733
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,992
If you're being framed,

734
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:38,470
you're gonna be more use to us
floating around.

735
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,518
Can we go now?

736
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:58,437
Just one more thing, Julian...

737
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:03,470
don't tell cons
they get paid for line-ups.

738
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:06,518
Some cops don't have
a sense of humour.

739
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,799
Hi. I'm here
to see Mrs Williams.

740
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:10,873
- I'm Julian Kay.
- I'll take care of this, Wilma.

741
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:16,432
- Julian, why are you here?
- Can I talk to you?

742
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,476
What about?

743
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,836
Were the police here?

744
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:25,036
There was a detective here.

745
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:28,795
I was very surprised
you used my name.

746
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,270
I'm very, very sorry
about that, Lisa,

747
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:35,113
but this is very important to me.

748
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,191
I told him the truth.

749
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:41,956
Lisa, you didn't,
I was with you until after midnight.

750
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,871
That's not the truth.

751
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,315
Julian, I can't...

752
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,197
you weren't here.

753
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:50,191
What is it, dear?

754
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:51,599
This is Julian Kay,

755
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:54,990
the one who is helping
with the decorating.

756
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:59,870
The boy who said he was with me
the night of that murder.

757
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:04,476
Mr Kay, it's bad enough
you made a fool of my wife

758
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,516
But then spreading lies...

759
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:09,512
- Leave us alone.
- I wasn't lying.

760
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:14,355
Whatever you did, you won't
to get out of it by dragging...

761
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,795
I just came here for the truth.

762
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:21,271
- I know you're lying.
- How do you know I'm lying?

763
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:26,150
Because I was here with my wife
the entire evening.

764
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,992
Thank you, Mr Kay.

765
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,475
You're not very good at this.

766
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:36,757
- What?
- Following people. You're lousy.

767
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:40,196
- What are you talking about?
- Who's paying you?

768
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:43,317
- You're not a cop.
- I'm calling the police.

769
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:46,153
You want to call? Go ahead, call.

770
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:48,276
What have we got here?

771
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,715
Floyd... Floyd Wicker. Nice name.

772
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,109
Born 7-23-52.

773
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,031
Hawthorne Avenue, LA.

774
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,111
Driver's license, American Express,

775
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,919
Mastercharge,
picture of girlfriend...

776
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,515
So-so,
eyes too close together, Floyd.

777
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,477
What else have we got?

778
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,630
California State
Congressional Library pass,

779
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:11,235
California State identification,
California...

780
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:15,069
State Senate pass...

781
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,071
Senator Charles Stratton.

782
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:20,630
- Who the fuck are you?
- You can read.

783
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:25,869
Here.

784
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,791
You work for Senator Stratton?

785
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,473
Yes.

786
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:37,833
- Why are you following me?
- I was told to.

787
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,480
- By the senator?
- Who else?

788
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,269
Why didn't he ask me
about my private life himself?

789
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:49,316
Huh? You don't know. You don't know.

790
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:52,870
Well, Floyd, I'm gonna
make this easy for you

791
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,712
so you don't forget.

792
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,836
This is my telephone number.

793
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:01,471
Now, you tell... the senator
if he wants to talk to me...

794
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,916
he can just give me a call,
all right?

795
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,958
Now, you fuck off
and leave me alone!

796
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,275
I received your message, Mr Kay.

797
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:45,390
- Thought I'd see you.
- Good evening, Senator.

798
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:48,074
- A vodka tonic.
- Yes, sir.

799
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,118
This is heartwarming.

800
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,875
Nice to see you haven't lost touch
with your constituency.

801
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,635
I'm not talking as a senator,
but as a husband.

802
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:01,314
That's too bad. I'm not a wife.

803
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,798
Very funny.

804
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,518
What do you want?

805
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,115
- Want?
- I know who you are.

806
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,760
I can't stop my wife being a fool,

807
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,230
but I can stop her
from being blackmailed.

808
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:25,752
- I don't know what you mean.
- You don't?

809
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:30,231
The police think you're involved
in a murder in Palm Springs.

810
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:34,518
Three days later,
you seduced my wife at a fund-raiser

811
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,194
to blackmail me into helping you.

812
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:42,876
- You're crazy, mister.
- Am I?

813
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:59,228
Last night, my wife asked me
about the Rheiman murder.

814
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:02,630
Didn't make any sense
till I heard about you.

815
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,990
You talked to Michelle about this?

816
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,836
You're not gonna blackmail me.

817
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:13,070
You don't know anything about this.

818
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:16,232
But I do know a whore when I see one.

819
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,878
How much?

820
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,955
Not to see your wife again?

821
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,832
5,000.

822
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,914
You'll have the cash in the morning.

823
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:42,636
I'm seeing Michelle
because I want to see her...

824
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:45,314
and because she wants to see me.

825
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,439
I don't want a dime from you.

826
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:04,117
That may be even simpler.

827
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:08,159
You live off the good graces
of a few people,

828
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:12,279
like Mrs Andros,
who was at the door a minute ago...

829
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,920
and of places such as this.

830
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,956
You're just a hanger-on.

831
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:21,158
Unless you want to find
a new crowd to hang onto,

832
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,196
don't see my wife again.

833
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,594
- How you doing?
- Not bad. How about you?

834
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:29,148
I'm looking for Leon James.
Seen him around?

835
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:31,879
Yeah. He's probably at Probe.

836
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:34,155
OK. Thanks. Take care.

837
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:05,713
Hey, Julie.

838
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,950
Hey, Jason.

839
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,679
I haven't seen you lately.
What brings you here?

840
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,671
Have you seen Leon around?

841
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,036
Oh, yeah.
He was showing off his new boy.

842
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,680
I think he's over there someplace.

843
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,512
OK, thanks.

844
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,672
Hey, Julie!
I thought that was you.

845
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:35,832
I've been looking for you.
I want to talk.

846
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,514
- Let's go out back.
- OK.

847
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,274
What you doing here?

848
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:44,874
You... coming from a funeral?

849
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,838
I hear you're
showing off a new boy.

850
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:52,232
I'm gonna make sure none
of these fruits snatch him from me.

851
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:59,074
You heard anything
about the Rheiman killing?

852
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:01,116
That's all I've heard about.

853
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:03,760
Cops on my ass like white on rice.

854
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:08,868
- They're giving me the third degree.
- Everybody else, too.

855
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,190
I may need your help.

856
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,475
I don't have an alibi.

857
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,676
You're the one that sent me.

858
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,072
You need one?

859
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,759
Yeah.

860
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,070
I'll see what I can do.

861
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,830
Who do you think killed her?

862
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,911
If I was the police,

863
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,676
I'd be more interested in Rheiman.
He's a freak, you know.

864
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:46,992
He's a freak...
but he's got an alibi.

865
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,991
An alibi?

866
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:53,596
Julie, I got something working
tonight, a little thing.

867
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:57,036
I'll cut you in on it
if you're interested.

868
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,997
Straight?

869
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,753
This time of night? Are you serious?

870
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,434
Leon, I'm sick of doing your shit.

871
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:08,637
No more fag stuff.
No more kink. Nothing.

872
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:12,474
- Finito! Got it?
- I heard about your problems.

873
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,516
What problems?

874
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:17,990
Your clientele, Julie,
your rich pussy.

875
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:21,356
They won't touch you.
They say it's too hot.

876
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:25,479
- They're looking for new boys.
- Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em!

877
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,835
Hey, Julie, listen...

878
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:31,674
you ask me to help you
out of a tight spot,

879
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,637
I'm glad to do it.

880
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:37,633
But I ask you to do my trick,
you say no.

881
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:41,633
Now, how you expect me
to help you, huh?

882
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,954
You give me the alibi,
then we'll talk about tricks.

883
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,796
- I have to talk to you.
- Hey, baby.

884
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,075
God, I'm glad to see you.

885
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,276
Are you OK? You look so worn out.

886
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,191
I didn't sleep much.

887
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:23,431
- Want to go for a walk?
- Yeah.

888
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,078
I'll get my shoes.

889
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:33,433
What's wrong?
Are you gonna tell me about it?

890
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,074
Hey.

891
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:43,278
Hey... you.

892
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,157
Come on, tell me.

893
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:53,670
When I said I didn't want
to make love to you,

894
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:56,957
I didn't mean it. I want to fuck you.

895
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,349
I always want to fuck you.

896
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:12,516
- Is that what you came to tell me?
- No.

897
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:15,910
Charles asked me to leave
for two months,

898
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,312
till the primaries are over.
I'm going to Rome.

899
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:26,278
Two months...

900
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,597
I'll be back. Wait for me.

901
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:40,393
I don't know if I can.
The police searched my apartment.

902
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:43,199
- Maybe Charles...
- That's not what I'm saying.

903
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,835
I don't know what I'm saying.

904
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:06,714
All my life... l've been
looking for something.

905
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,597
I don't even know what it is.

906
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:11,513
- Let me...
- Maybe you're what I'm looking for.

907
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:20,395
I gave Charles my word.
I've got to go.

908
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,275
It'll be all right.

909
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,437
Yeah.

910
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,750
I have to leave.

911
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:54,959
Shit!

912
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:23,877
I don't know.
I haven't seen him since yesterday.

913
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:27,032
- Tell me.
- I don't know. Honest.

914
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,680
The police have been
here all morning.

915
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:33,639
- Another cop's in his room.
- Does he call in?

916
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,517
I'm not supposed to tell.

917
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:39,673
OK. Next time he calls in
I've gotta talk to him.

918
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:42,115
Ask if I can meet him.

919
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:57,710
Do you know a blonde kid
that hangs around with Leon James?

920
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:59,870
Nah. Couldn't tell you.

921
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:20,113
Anne, I'm sorry.
I've got to talk to you.

922
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:23,919
I can't now.
I'm looking for somebody.

923
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,434
Perino's? Look, I don't have time.

924
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:31,192
Yeah, all right, Perino's. Yes, 8:30.

925
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:46,790
Jill, this is Julian.

926
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:51,317
Yeah, I know.
You got some messages for me?

927
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:56,798
Michelle?

928
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,395
Tell her to meet me at Perino's.

929
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,751
Son of a bitch, it's Rheiman.

930
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:44,638
Mr Julian.
You can't come in like this.

931
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,551
I was working. I forgot.

932
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:49,598
- I'll get you a jacket.
- No, it's OK.

933
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:57,880
Julie, you look like shit.
What's wrong?

934
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:01,236
- Everything. Straight bourbon.
- What are you doing?

935
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:05,199
The way you look
you couldn't get a maid to fuck you.

936
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:10,115
Anne, the cops are after me. They're
framing me for the Rheiman murder.

937
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,953
- Where have you been?
- Looking for somebody.

938
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,792
Last night?

939
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:19,078
Mrs Farfter came in last night
on a flight from Stockholm.

940
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:23,199
There was no one there to meet her.
She was furious.

941
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:26,158
I've got hell to pay. What happened?

942
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,958
Did you hear me?

943
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:31,555
I said the cops are after me...
for murder.

944
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:33,596
So you stand me up.

945
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:35,591
Jesus Christ!

946
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,318
What do you want?

947
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,272
Are you gonna help me?

948
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:51,831
I've checked around, Julie.
You are in trouble.

949
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:54,115
That's why I need your help.

950
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:56,760
You never did anything for me.

951
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:58,592
Never did anything for...

952
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:03,151
- I'm your number-one boy.
- And you fight me every turn.

953
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:07,677
You ask favours, then blow a gig
I worked six months to arrange.

954
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:10,832
- I explained that already.
- I'm through, Julie.

955
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:13,115
You'll have to fend for yourself.

956
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:16,556
I don't care
what happens to you any more.

957
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:30,596
Excuse me. I'll be back.

958
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:48,198
Julian, thank God you got my message.
I've been looking for you.

959
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:50,475
It's all right, baby. It's OK.

960
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:54,235
No, it's not all right.
Charles talked to the DA.

961
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:57,596
They found the weapon.
They're going to arrest you.

962
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:59,910
That can't be. It can't be.

963
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,309
What are you going to do?

964
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,277
I don't know.

965
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:11,749
What can I do to help?

966
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:14,798
- Nothing.
- There's gotta be something.

967
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:17,633
Don't you understand?
I'm in big trouble.

968
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:19,711
- Just stay away.
- No.

969
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:23,509
There's gonna be a scandal.
You know what a scandal is?

970
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:26,717
You know what that's like?
Stay away from me.

971
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:30,395
I'll ruin your life, your husband's.
It's all over.

972
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:32,118
Not if you're innocent.

973
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:38,235
How do you know I'm innocent?
Look at me, right in the face

974
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:41,995
Can you tell me without hesitation
you know I'm innocent?

975
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:43,638
Yes.

976
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:51,198
Listen, forget me.

977
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:52,872
Is someone in there?

978
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,518
I never loved you.

979
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:08,397
- Julie?
- Let me in. It's important.

980
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:16,679
You look terrible.
You want to clean up, shave?

981
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:21,276
I'm sorry to bug you this late.
I've been looking for you.

982
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:25,118
I'm listening.

983
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:30,878
You got my alibi ready?
I'm gonna need it today.

984
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:33,599
It's not ready yet, Julie. Tomorrow.

985
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:35,875
I'm still piecing it together.

986
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:40,635
It's not easy.
I'm trying to get it right.

987
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:43,951
- Why are you framing me?
- What?

988
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:48,556
Judy Rheiman's murder...
you were behind it. You, Rheiman,

989
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:51,916
your cute little blonde
boyfriend in the bedroom there,

990
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,798
who planted the jewels in my car.

991
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:57,348
I don't know
what you're talking about.

992
01:37:57,440 --> 01:38:00,193
What the fuck is that, then?

993
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:03,716
He's the one that
actually killed her, isn't he?

994
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:08,110
Leon, what happened?

995
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:12,034
You sent him out there
with Rheiman and his wife,

996
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:14,793
he got rough and he killed her.

997
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,757
Shut your fucking face!

998
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:20,071
I never saw that shit
before in my life.

999
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:22,390
I want to know one thing.

1000
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:25,916
What will it cost
to get you off my back?

1001
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,560
You ain't talking money,
you're talking murder.

1002
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:31,552
- How much?
- I feel sorry for you.

1003
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:32,868
How much?

1004
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:37,836
It don't make no difference
how much, Julie.

1005
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:40,798
The other side will always pay more.

1006
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:00,475
Got it on real tight, huh?

1007
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,151
You're real proud
of yourself, aren't you?

1008
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:12,199
The police found the murder weapon
a block from your apartment.

1009
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,271
That bitch in Palm Springs

1010
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:20,275
is gonna change her mind
any time now and identify you.

1011
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:24,796
Police want you real bad, Julie.

1012
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,836
Now they got you.

1013
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:47,438
Look, I'm worth maybe...
20, 30 grand. It's yours.

1014
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:54,873
I'll break your new boys for you.

1015
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,355
I'll work just for you.

1016
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:02,192
Just for you, Leon,

1017
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:04,794
40/60 split.

1018
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,950
It's fair, 40/60.

1019
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:09,553
40...

1020
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:12,996
30/70. I'll...

1021
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:17,354
I'll do fag tricks. I'll do kink.

1022
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:20,159
I'll do anything you want me to!

1023
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:25,077
Leave me alone and get out, Julie.

1024
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:32,992
Why me?

1025
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:36,951
Why did you pick me?

1026
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:42,153
Because you were framable, Julie.

1027
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:46,992
You stepped on too many toes.

1028
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:49,640
Nobody cared about you.

1029
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:53,712
I never liked you much myself.

1030
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,431
Now get out.

1031
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:06,033
Who's down there?

1032
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:10,074
Your new boyfriend? You motherfucker!

1033
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:15,398
Oh, my God!

1034
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:19,996
Don't let me fall!
Please, Julie, help me!

1035
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:22,753
Don't fall. I need you.

1036
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:24,637
Give me your hand.

1037
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:27,075
- Reach up.
- I'm trying.

1038
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:30,037
Help me. Help me, please!

1039
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:33,590
God! Don't fall!

1040
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:47,674
Julian!
Would you answer a few questions?

1041
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:52,196
- Who was involved?
- How old are you?

1042
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:55,795
How long had you
been seeing Mrs Rheiman?

1043
01:42:55,880 --> 01:43:00,510
- Any Hollywood notables?
- How much money have you made?

1044
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:03,398
Julian, give me an exclusive.

1045
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:07,155
How much do you get for a trick?

1046
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:10,038
Give me a break, Julian.

1047
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:13,351
Do you feel
you're being framed, Julian?

1048
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:16,477
Were you ever afraid of the husbands?

1049
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:43,353
I wish I had arrested you earlier.

1050
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:45,670
It would've been easier
for everybody.

1051
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:48,149
You'd better end
this pretrial publicity.

1052
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:51,198
We're moving him
to Palm Springs soon.

1053
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:56,195
You have anything to say, Julian?

1054
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,752
Julian?

1055
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:14,193
No.

1056
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:48,952
Hello, Julian.

1057
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:52,231
Going away on your trip?

1058
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:54,709
No. I decided not to.

1059
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:00,430
- Does your husband know you're here?
- No.

1060
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:03,912
Why did you come?

1061
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:09,756
I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

1062
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:15,871
Don't come back, Michelle.

1063
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:26,555
Are you satisfied with your lawyer?

1064
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,672
It doesn't matter.

1065
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:32,558
Don't go.

1066
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:59,159
Michelle Stratton is paying
for my services, Julian.

1067
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:03,313
I think you know this is
a matter of some secrecy.

1068
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:08,957
Tell her not to bother.

1069
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:11,634
Julian, you'll have to help us more.

1070
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:17,035
You tell Michelle to forget me.

1071
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:22,478
I'm more worried
about your defence, Julian,

1072
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:25,233
than about her private life.

1073
01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:29,393
We'll must go into the details
the night of the murder.

1074
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:32,438
The maid saw you trying to save Leon,

1075
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:35,830
so the police are only pressing
the Rheiman case.

1076
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:39,037
The papers and TV
are trying you already.

1077
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:42,192
The police aren't
investigating any more.

1078
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:45,795
We need some help, some facts,

1079
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:48,713
to get the investigation going again.

1080
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:51,712
Then we can find out
about Leon, Rheiman...

1081
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:53,313
maybe the blonde boy.

1082
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:56,912
How about it, Julian?

1083
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:12,953
Lieutenant Curtis?

1084
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:15,508
Yes, Mrs Stratton. This is an honour.

1085
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,238
May I sit?

1086
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:21,716
I was told you wanted to see me.

1087
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:26,237
I want to talk to you about
the Julian Kay/Rheiman murder case.

1088
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:27,878
Yes.

1089
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:30,315
I'm paying
for Mr Kay's defence.

1090
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:33,038
I know.

1091
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:37,636
I'm paying for Mr Kay's defence
because I know he's not guilty.

1092
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:40,280
I don't want
an obstruction of justice.

1093
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:42,874
How do you know he's not guilty?

1094
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:46,111
Because he wasn't
in Palm Springs that night.

1095
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:49,510
- No?
- No. He was with me.

1096
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:07,957
I told them, Julian.

1097
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:10,395
I heard.

1098
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:14,833
You didn't have to do that, Michelle.

1099
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:17,115
You could have forgotten me.

1100
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:19,156
I'd rather die.

1101
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:26,160
What will you do now?

I don't know. I can't go home.

1103
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:33,357
The newsmen
are waiting outside for me.

1104
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:35,396
There's dozens of them.

1105
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:41,517
Why did you do it?

1106
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:46,110
I had no choice.

1107
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:49,236
I love you.

1108
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:59,115
My God, Michelle...

1109
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:04,430
it's taken me so long
to come to you.
