00:02:06,264 --> 00:02:08,335
real-life massacres
have been put on tape

That's right.
Would you like to see it?

57
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:53,543
Sure.

64
00:04:16,186 --> 00:04:20,156

the pockets this time.

90

91
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,575

some screen time

- Really?

93
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:11,854

113
00:07:32,728 --> 00:07:34,039

114
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,834
Why not me?

115
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:38,837
It's because I'm adopted,
isn't it?

116
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:41,426
Because you're adopted?
No, sweetheart.

117
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,703
Of course, not.

118
00:07:42,807 --> 00:07:44,118
It's because you're a girl.

119
00:07:44,222 --> 00:07:47,156
- What?
- Sorry. Woman.

120
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:50,124
Ma, I mean no disrespect,
but she's got to hear this.

121
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:51,436

125
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:03,690

things are done around here.

126
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:05,657

00:12:50,493 --> 00:12:54,428
I need you to help
Mackenzie tomorrow night.

182
00:12:54,532 --> 00:12:56,189
He can't do it alone.

183
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:58,363
Can't we postpone
the release date?

184
00:12:58,467 --> 00:13:01,435
The store won't survive
another setback.

185
00:13:02,747 --> 00:13:06,544
Please, kiddo.
Do it for me.

186
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:10,928
Do you want to
go over the plan?

187
00:13:11,031 --> 00:13:12,412
No, I'm ready.

188
00:13:12,515 --> 00:13:14,276
- Are you?
- "Are you?"

189
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:15,795
Dude, cut the crap.

190
00:13:15,898 --> 00:13:17,348
Let's at least get you
to study the floor plans

191
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:19,557
or practice some moves
with the knife.

192
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,007
Pass.

193
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:30,533
Bezzleman residence.

194
00:13:30,637 --> 00:13:32,604
Oh, hello, Mother.

195
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,330
Four rings?

196
00:13:34,434 --> 00:13:36,781
I guess I couldn't hear you
over the absolute rager

197
00:13:36,885 --> 00:13:38,887
currently taking place
at our home.

198
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,993
Can't you hear the drunken,
destructive masses?

199
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:48,172
Well, I learned from the best.

200
00:13:48,275 --> 00:13:51,071
I will also have you know that
your dearest and only child

201
00:13:51,175 --> 00:13:55,317
has upheld her oath to have
absolutely no fun this weekend.

202
00:13:57,802 --> 00:13:59,010
Uh-huh.

203
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,426
Yes, of course.

204
00:14:02,496 --> 00:14:04,326
Well, anyway, got to run.

205
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:07,777
There's a documentary about rock
tumbling that's about to start.

206
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,020
Night night.

207
00:14:21,722 --> 00:14:23,345
Good luck in there, killer.

208
00:14:38,015 --> 00:14:39,464
Back door, buddy.

209
00:14:39,568 --> 00:14:42,502
It's the back door
they keep unlocked.

210
00:15:01,245 --> 00:15:02,798
Hello?

211
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,249
She's already
out of the shower.

212
00:15:05,352 --> 00:15:07,009
Bummer.

213
00:15:07,113 --> 00:15:10,047
Is there any way
to get her dirty again?

214
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,532
I really wanted my first kill
to be in the shower.

215
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:13,878
<i>Where's the dude?</i>

216
00:15:13,982 --> 00:15:16,122
Where she should be--
washing up.

217
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:18,331
<i>Well, there you go.</i>

218
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:20,471
<i>You'll get your shower kill
after all.</i>

219
00:15:20,574 --> 00:15:25,648
Eww. No, I don't want to see
some guy's gross dick.

220
00:15:38,903 --> 00:15:40,663

00:15:56,127 --> 00:15:57,232

00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:36,409
Wait, I need to go back
and grab my clothes.

234
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:39,343
No, babe.
It's not safe in there.

235
00:16:52,908 --> 00:16:54,461
Oh, my God.

00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:58,776

Please don't kill me.

242
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:45,227
Hello? Please help.
I'm at 75 Cardinal Drive.

243
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:46,573
There's been a--

244
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:48,773
<i>"May your slashes be swift

<i>May your success
know no bounds. Dad.</i>

246
00:19:52,363 --> 00:19:54,814
<i>P.S., follow the rules."</i>

247
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,396
Before one slices their way
to stardom,

248
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,296
they must first
stalk their prey.

249
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:31,885
I've heard high school
is a target-rich environment.

250
00:20:31,989 --> 00:20:35,441
And though the hallowed halls
of Clover High are alien to me,

251
00:20:35,544 --> 00:20:37,650
I kind of look the part.

252
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:42,241
Oh, screw that.
I <i>am</i> the part.

253
00:20:42,344 --> 00:20:45,623
Or at least I hope I'm the part.

254
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,525
I wonder if I'll get shoved
in a locker.

255
00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:55,599
Come on, Ab.
Power of positive thinking.

256
00:20:55,702 --> 00:20:56,427
Yeah.

257
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:58,671
Glenn, it's Abbie.

258
00:20:58,774 --> 00:21:01,190
I'm calling to offer you
the role of a lifetime.

259
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:07,473
What the freak?

260
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:09,302
Big day.

It's my undercover alias,
Sergio,

whose tragic fall from stardom

264
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:19,347

No, I've done so much
to prepare for this part.

269
00:21:28,425 --> 00:21:30,703

00:27:49,564 --> 00:27:51,083
Star quarterback, slain.

362
00:27:51,186 --> 00:27:54,362
Valedictorian?
More like Vale-no-morian.

363
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:56,053
And I can't even begin
to describe the horrors

364
00:27:56,157 --> 00:27:57,883
that befell the bowling team.

365
00:27:58,953 --> 00:28:02,335
Largest mass disemboweling
on record.

366
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:05,166
Dang.

367
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:06,754
Yeah.

368
00:28:06,857 --> 00:28:09,170
And that was just last year.

369
00:28:27,464 --> 00:28:29,017
I'm in here.

370
00:28:32,676 --> 00:28:34,816
Um, hi.

371
00:28:38,855 --> 00:28:42,237
What are you doing?
You shouldn't be up.

372
00:28:43,687 --> 00:28:46,069
I'm not on my deathbed, kiddo.

373
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,243
Yeah.

374
00:28:48,347 --> 00:28:51,902
Look, time flies, huh?

375
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:57,425
Oh, I, uh, found
your first knife, too.

376
00:29:04,156 --> 00:29:07,090
Hmm, cute.

377
00:29:08,885 --> 00:29:11,163
Anyway, got to run.

378
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:14,097
Those pesky teens aren't
going to stalk themselves.

379
00:29:15,684 --> 00:29:19,274
Um, you need--
you need a lift or...

380
00:29:19,378 --> 00:29:20,724
Or I-I could come along.

381
00:29:20,828 --> 00:29:23,727
Maybe wait in the car
in case you need me.

382
00:29:23,831 --> 00:29:26,799
Nah, I got it covered.

You got a light?

392
00:31:43,453 --> 00:31:46,145
A woodwind requires
maximum lung capacity,

393
00:31:46,249 --> 00:31:47,767
which would be compromised

394
00:31:47,871 --> 00:31:49,459
by just a single puff
of that cigarette.

395

00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:13,448
Hey, there, stranger.

401
00:32:13,552 --> 00:32:15,761
Are you picking
on our dear Patty Cake?

402
00:32:15,864 --> 00:32:17,521
You know I hate that name.

403
00:32:20,386 --> 00:32:24,080

00:32:24,632 --> 00:32:27,635
Yo, check it out.

00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:32,398

406
00:32:32,502 --> 00:32:35,884
Oh, hell yes.

407
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:37,196
Love it.

408
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,992
Dynamo work, my friend.

409
00:32:40,096 --> 00:32:42,891
Tonight's the night.
Come on out.

410
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:44,479
On a school night?
I can't.

411
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:46,102
Oh, come on, Patty.

412
00:32:46,205 --> 00:32:47,827
I heard they don't even card.

413
00:32:47,931 --> 00:32:49,346

00:32:56,112 --> 00:32:57,837
Dude, show tonight.

Ladies, you coming

418
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:02,049
Tell your friends, okay?

419
00:33:02,152 --> 00:33:04,120
Yeah. You take one, too.

420
00:33:04,223 --> 00:33:06,985

Yeah.

432
00:34:04,352 --> 00:34:07,528
I just wanted to apologize.

433
00:34:08,253 --> 00:34:10,703
I think we got started
on the wrong foot.

434
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,224
I usually practice
under the bleachers

435
00:34:14,328 --> 00:34:17,296
so the other kids
won't mess with me, so...

436
00:34:20,196 --> 00:34:22,336
So you're new here.

437
00:34:23,406 --> 00:34:24,545
Yeah.

438
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:25,891
That's fun.

439
00:34:25,994 --> 00:34:27,617
Or maybe it's not.
I'm sorry.

440
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,791
I didn't-- I didn't mean
to, like, speak for you.

441
00:34:33,588 --> 00:34:36,971
Anyway, if you ever need someone

442
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,285
to show you around town,
let me know.

443
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:42,080
Not that I get out much, but--

444
00:34:42,183 --> 00:34:43,874
Well, no. I mean,
I leave my house

445
00:34:43,978 --> 00:34:50,881
to go places like-- like--
like school and-- and... school.

446
00:34:52,055 --> 00:34:55,438
But yeah.

447
00:34:56,508 --> 00:34:57,612
Thanks.

448
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,512
Of course.

449
00:35:06,242 --> 00:35:07,415
That's Izzy.

450
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:09,107
We don't have
a dance squad here.

451
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:12,696
But if we did,
Izzy would surely be captain.

452
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,320
She won second place
at the talent show last year.

453
00:35:15,423 --> 00:35:17,011
Mr. Ferguson won't let her
get up from her desk,

454
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,808
but she still finds a way
to practice her righteous moves.

455
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:34,408
What's up?

456
00:35:43,796 --> 00:35:47,075
So, I'd love to hear how
everything's coming together.

457
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:49,285
Well, I was wondering

458
00:35:49,388 --> 00:35:51,735
if you could provide
some insight on procedure.

459
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,323
Happy to.

460
00:35:54,013 --> 00:35:55,360
Okay.

461
00:35:56,361 --> 00:35:58,432
How would one reverse
the circle?

462
00:35:58,535 --> 00:36:01,262
Is there an appeal process
of some kind?

463
00:36:01,366 --> 00:36:02,746
What's to appeal?

464
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,679
You see the circle.
You kill the kid.

465
00:36:04,783 --> 00:36:06,060
Pretty straightforward.

466
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,303
Why are you asking?

467
00:36:07,406 --> 00:36:09,753
I don't know.

468
00:36:09,857 --> 00:36:14,793
Offing Sam Crane
just doesn't feel right.

469
00:36:16,622 --> 00:36:19,315
Sam Crane.

470
00:36:19,418 --> 00:36:21,040
The girl who nearly killed you.

471
00:36:21,144 --> 00:36:23,319
Exactly. She didn't run.
She fought me.

472
00:36:23,422 --> 00:36:24,941
She set a trap.

473
00:36:25,044 --> 00:36:26,529
She's promiscuous.

474
00:36:26,632 --> 00:36:28,116
She's crass.

475
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,188
She-- She abuses drugs.

476
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:34,261
Abuses drugs?
Like-- Like what, weed?

477
00:36:34,364 --> 00:36:35,641
Like weed?

478
00:36:35,745 --> 00:36:37,712
I can't believe what
I'm hearing here.

479
00:36:37,816 --> 00:36:40,128
What's wrong
with a little change?

480
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:41,544
They're not all that bad.

481
00:36:41,647 --> 00:36:45,341
Take, um, Izzy, for instance.

482
00:36:47,688 --> 00:36:49,552
Check out this dance routine
she did.

483
00:36:52,693 --> 00:36:54,591
She's actually pretty cool.

484
00:37:01,702 --> 00:37:04,325
Okay.
Let me stop you there.

485
00:37:05,637 --> 00:37:09,123
You can't let your emotions
cloud your judgment.

486
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,745
Emotions?

487
00:37:12,195 --> 00:37:14,266
This isn't up for debate.

488
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:17,821
Sam dies.
The dancing queen dies.

489
00:37:17,925 --> 00:37:21,618
The rest of that
misfit group-- D-E-A-D.

490
00:37:36,357 --> 00:37:40,741
<i>I want those nachos hot.
Extra sour cream.</i>

491

♪ Don't

492
00:39:10,969 --> 00:39:14,144
Don't tell me you guys
already played.

493
00:39:14,248 --> 00:39:16,526
Yeah, you missed it, dude.

494
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:20,288
Like our best show ever.
The crowd went the fuck off.

495
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:22,394
Damn, really?

496
00:39:22,498 --> 00:39:25,742
No, there were
like six people there.

497
00:39:25,846 --> 00:39:28,952
And Billy got so drunk, he
pissed his pants three songs in.

498
00:39:33,129 --> 00:39:34,510
Hey.

499
00:39:36,132 --> 00:39:37,927
I'm so sorry.

500
00:39:45,244 --> 00:39:49,732
Uh, are you heading out
now or--

501
00:39:49,835 --> 00:39:51,423
Uh, well, I am.

502
00:39:51,527 --> 00:39:54,461
Not sure about Prince of Puke
over there, but...

503
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:59,500
You wanted to join me
for some beer murdering?

504
00:39:59,604 --> 00:40:00,915
The promoter refused to pay us,

505
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:03,608
so I stole this parting gift
of cheap swill.

506
00:40:06,127 --> 00:40:10,546
So, where will we take
these innocent beers to die?

507
00:40:13,618 --> 00:40:14,929
To the folly of youth.

508
00:40:15,033 --> 00:40:16,586
Cheers.

509
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,701
God, I'm not going to miss
this place.

510
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:32,050
What are your plans
after graduation?

511
00:40:34,121 --> 00:40:36,951
To get as far away from here
as I possibly can.

512
00:40:39,402 --> 00:40:40,955
Smart move.

513
00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:42,854
It's just been...

514
00:40:44,338 --> 00:40:46,616
...so much death at this school.

515
00:40:47,997 --> 00:40:52,898
And the town just carries on
without missing a beat.

516
00:40:55,314 --> 00:40:57,558
I can't tell you how many
funerals I've been to

517
00:40:57,662 --> 00:40:59,111
since freshman year.

518
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:06,015
That's fucked up.

519
00:41:06,118 --> 00:41:08,983
Just another day
in the neighborhood, I guess.

520
00:41:12,297 --> 00:41:13,781
But, uh...

521
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,991
...you're cool.

522
00:41:18,234 --> 00:41:20,788
This is cool.

523
00:41:22,445 --> 00:41:23,826
Hanging.

524
00:41:26,414 --> 00:41:27,933
Oh, uh...

525
00:41:31,454 --> 00:41:33,076
I made you this.

526
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:42,085
Um... can we... listen to it?

527
00:41:42,189 --> 00:41:44,329
Right now?

528
00:41:44,432 --> 00:41:45,951

run and grab... that.

Out.

554

Until 3:00 in the morning?

555
00:44:11,718 --> 00:44:14,582
Yeah.
Not like I have a curfew.

556
00:44:14,686 --> 00:44:16,239
Because I called Glenn.

557
00:44:16,343 --> 00:44:19,449
He said the last he heard
from you is a little after 9:00.

558
00:44:19,553 --> 00:44:21,831
- So?
- So why are you out so late?

559
00:44:21,935 --> 00:44:23,902
Have you been drinking?

560
00:44:24,006 --> 00:44:25,835
Please.

561
00:44:25,939 --> 00:44:28,873
Knock it off with the
after-school-special bullshit.

562
00:44:35,189 --> 00:44:40,229
The more you get to know them,
the closer you get...

563
00:44:42,196 --> 00:44:44,820
...the harder it will be
to do your job.

564
00:44:46,891 --> 00:44:48,927
Thanks for the advice, old man.

565
00:44:52,448 --> 00:44:54,933
She's not your friend, Abigail.

566
00:44:57,039 --> 00:44:58,454
None of this is real.

567
00:45:22,236 --> 00:45:24,480
So tragic,
what happened to Izzy.

568
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:30,831
All it takes is for
one good dance move to go bad.

569
00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:34,317
Just one.

570
00:45:43,257 --> 00:45:44,742
It's me.

571
00:45:49,091 --> 00:45:50,748
Do you know that kid?

572
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:54,890
Your dad's here.

573
00:45:54,993 --> 00:45:57,168
I don't even want to ask about
the getup today.

574
00:45:57,271 --> 00:45:58,790
Do you think this
will make the cut?

575
00:45:58,894 --> 00:46:02,449
Don't care.
Who's working the store?

576
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:04,209
Uh...

577
00:46:08,662 --> 00:46:10,422
How's it going?

578
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:24,920
What's going on?

579
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,576
Get in the car.

580
00:46:43,524 --> 00:46:44,871
Here.

581
00:46:46,182 --> 00:46:48,840
Those two, coming out the door
right now.

582
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:04,235
Crap.

583
00:47:09,999 --> 00:47:12,519
Finish the job. Tonight.

586
00:47:40,996 --> 00:47:43,101
<i>We're barely staying afloat
month to month.</i>

587
00:47:44,275 --> 00:47:46,518

another setback.</i>

588
00:47:50,212 --> 00:47:52,386

589
00:47:54,802 --> 00:47:55,907
<i>She's not your friend.</i>

590
00:47:56,011 --> 00:47:57,115
You hung over?

591
00:47:57,219 --> 00:48:01,706
I, uh-- Yeah.
A little bit.

592
00:48:01,809 --> 00:48:03,501
Last night was fun.

593
00:48:04,605 --> 00:48:08,506
So you want to come over,
listen to records?

594
00:48:08,609 --> 00:48:10,335
Can't. I got work.

595
00:48:10,439 --> 00:48:13,511
Okay.
I could pick you up after.

596
00:48:13,614 --> 00:48:14,892
We could grab a bite.

597
00:48:14,995 --> 00:48:16,652
I can show you
my favorite pizza place.

598
00:48:16,755 --> 00:48:18,171
Not today.

599
00:48:18,757 --> 00:48:20,898
Oh.

600
00:48:21,001 --> 00:48:23,245
Okay.

601
00:48:23,348 --> 00:48:24,418
Cool.

602
00:49:11,707 --> 00:49:13,433

Um, I knocked a few times.

608
00:50:09,144 --> 00:50:10,835
The window was open.

609
00:50:10,938 --> 00:50:14,287
And then you crept,
like a creep.

610
00:50:21,087 --> 00:50:24,435
Sorry I attacked.
First instinct.

611
00:50:29,923 --> 00:50:31,545
You want to fool around?

612
00:50:33,513 --> 00:50:34,997
What?

613
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:49,115
Where's that from?

614
00:50:50,668 --> 00:50:52,014
It's nothing.

615
00:50:52,911 --> 00:50:55,500
Sorry, I didn't mean to--

616
00:50:58,986 --> 00:51:00,609
Hello?

617
00:51:00,712 --> 00:51:02,128

618

What's wrong?

619
00:51:08,962 --> 00:51:10,205
What?

620
00:51:12,517 --> 00:51:13,622
No.

621
00:51:15,348 --> 00:51:16,487
How?

622
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:19,904
Oh, my God. Um...

623
00:51:20,007 --> 00:51:21,423
I'm just here with Abbie.

624
00:51:22,217 --> 00:51:23,735
Sure. Uh...

625
00:51:25,427 --> 00:51:27,601
Okay, call me back.

626
00:51:32,917 --> 00:51:34,367
Izzy's dead.

627
00:51:36,438 --> 00:51:37,784
What?

628
00:51:39,406 --> 00:51:40,649
No.

629
00:51:47,587 --> 00:51:48,864
Hello?

630
00:51:48,967 --> 00:51:51,660
Yeah, I just heard.

631
00:51:53,006 --> 00:51:54,214
What?

632
00:51:55,146 --> 00:51:57,528
Are you kidding me?
Who else?

633
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,531
No.

634
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:07,158
Abbie?

635
00:52:12,301 --> 00:52:15,546
Officer, what happened?

636
00:52:15,649 --> 00:52:20,137
We, the people of
this community, deserve to know.

637
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,587
Everyone, please go back
to your homes.

638
00:52:22,691 --> 00:52:24,451
Let us do our job.

639
00:52:24,555 --> 00:52:27,351
Oh, my God.

640
00:52:27,454 --> 00:52:30,354
What is happening to our town?

641
00:52:30,457 --> 00:52:34,185
What is happening
to our children?

00:52:43,021 --> 00:52:45,334

644
00:52:48,924 --> 00:52:50,443
Did you see me over there?

645
00:52:50,546 --> 00:52:52,376
I was just sort of improvising,

646
00:52:52,479 --> 00:52:55,655
but I really felt
that last moment.

647
00:52:55,758 --> 00:52:59,210
Great scene partner.
Real stuff.

00:53:01,626 --> 00:53:03,870

657
00:53:42,736 --> 00:53:46,775
Okay. Come on, really.
Who is this?

658
00:53:46,878 --> 00:53:48,846
<i>Silence, stupid teen.</i>

659
00:53:48,949 --> 00:53:55,266

00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:57,268

661
00:53:57,372 --> 00:53:58,614
How do I know
that you're telling the truth

662
00:53:58,718 --> 00:54:00,306
and this isn't some prank call?

663

Just get out, you stupid twat.

00:54:20,153 --> 00:54:22,707
- What was that about?
- We're next.

670
00:54:22,811 --> 00:54:24,191
So what do we do?

671
00:54:24,295 --> 00:54:26,504
Maybe it's time
we get the fuck out of Dodge.

672
00:54:28,472 --> 00:54:31,095

679
00:55:29,187 --> 00:55:30,948
What's the story?

680
00:55:31,051 --> 00:55:33,399
Well, there's good news
and there's bad news.

681
00:55:33,502 --> 00:55:34,952
What's the bad news?

682
00:55:35,055 --> 00:55:36,643
The bad news is they
don't have the part we need,

683
00:55:36,747 --> 00:55:38,714
so the van won't be fixed
till Monday.

684
00:55:38,818 --> 00:55:42,373
The good news is, if we cut
through those woods over there,

685
00:55:42,477 --> 00:55:44,271
we'll hit Camp Chillgood
in like a mile or so.

686
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:45,790
That's the good news?

687
00:55:45,894 --> 00:55:47,965
It sounds like a good place
to lie low.

688
00:55:48,068 --> 00:55:51,348
An abandoned campground seems
like a good place to lie low?

689
00:55:51,451 --> 00:55:53,039
The old dude in there
said it's haunted.

690
00:55:54,661 --> 00:55:58,769
It was definitely him, Glenn.
I just know it.

691
00:55:58,872 --> 00:56:01,012
Straight out of the "Bladecut 2"
playbook.

692
00:56:01,116 --> 00:56:03,567
Abbie, come on.

693
00:56:07,536 --> 00:56:09,607

694
00:56:17,443 --> 00:56:20,584
How much farther?

695
00:56:20,687 --> 00:56:22,586
This feels misguided.

696
00:56:47,749 --> 00:56:49,923
I'm glad you're here.

697
00:56:51,546 --> 00:56:54,238
We can still turn around.

698
00:57:00,313 --> 00:57:01,556
There it is.

699
00:57:02,177 --> 00:57:03,937

Guys?

702
00:57:09,633 --> 00:57:12,670
I'm beginning
to have second thoughts.

703
00:57:12,774 --> 00:57:15,155

Aah!

704
00:57:20,506 --> 00:57:23,750

705
00:57:25,649 --> 00:57:28,652
Leave now while you still can.

706
00:57:28,755 --> 00:57:31,586
Hey, back off, weirdo.

707
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,419
Go!

708
00:57:37,523 --> 00:57:38,869
Leave these woods

709
00:57:38,972 --> 00:57:42,217
or you'll end up
like the rest of them.

710
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,701
Dead.

711
00:57:47,429 --> 00:57:50,777
- Where did you come from, guy?
- Uh...

712
00:57:50,881 --> 00:57:55,230
You don't smell
like a dirty-ass drunk.

713
00:58:00,649 --> 00:58:02,099
Is that cologne?

714
00:58:02,202 --> 00:58:03,238
Uh...

715
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:10,625

719
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,290
Yeah. I've seen you before.

720
00:58:21,394 --> 00:58:22,775
Uh...

721
00:58:23,879 --> 00:58:27,607
These woods, it's--
it's not safe here, and--

722
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:29,298
Okay, I'm sorry.

723
00:58:29,402 --> 00:58:30,541
I can't continue with--

724
00:58:49,456 --> 00:58:53,460
That is some
Loch Ness-level shit.

725
00:59:05,162 --> 00:59:07,509
Hey.

726
00:59:07,613 --> 00:59:09,960
They got a fire pit.

727
00:59:10,685 --> 00:59:13,895
Anybody want to roast
some wieners?

728
00:59:33,984 --> 00:59:35,364
How about a scary story?

729
00:59:35,468 --> 00:59:36,780
Yes.

730
00:59:36,883 --> 00:59:38,782
Anybody got a good one?

731
00:59:39,368 --> 00:59:41,301
How about a real scary story?

732
00:59:42,337 --> 00:59:44,063
According to that newspaper,

733
00:59:44,166 --> 00:59:46,030
teenage campers have
been butchered year after year

734
00:59:46,134 --> 00:59:47,618
on these grounds.

735
00:59:47,722 --> 00:59:50,932
Whoa.
Just like our high school.

736
00:59:51,829 --> 00:59:54,107
Did they ever catch the killer?

737
00:59:54,211 --> 00:59:57,248
No. It's impossible
to catch a ghost.

738
00:59:57,352 --> 01:00:00,389
A ghost?

739
01:00:00,493 --> 01:00:03,047
Roger Bladecut.

740
01:00:09,122 --> 01:00:11,608
Do you think that's
the same guy that's after us?

741
01:00:11,711 --> 01:00:15,059
Come on. You guys don't really
believe in this crap, do you?

742
01:00:15,163 --> 01:00:16,267
It's true.

743
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,650
Roger Bladecut is real.

744
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:29,177
Look, some 60 years ago, Roger
was a little boy, a camper here,

745
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,973
and he died playing in that barn
across the way.

746
01:00:37,219 --> 01:00:40,809
Little Roger wasn't
the most popular of campers.

747
01:00:40,913 --> 01:00:42,915
So when a counselor
forced his bunk-mates

748
01:00:43,018 --> 01:00:45,607
to take him along
for a game of tag,

749
01:00:45,711 --> 01:00:47,644
the group was none too pleased.

750
01:00:47,747 --> 01:00:53,684
Now, Roger,
an uncoordinated and clumsy kid,

751
01:00:53,788 --> 01:00:55,790
couldn't catch
a single soul that day.

752
01:00:55,893 --> 01:00:58,896
He leapt and dove

753
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,624
and he chased the children
for what seemed like hours.

754
01:01:03,418 --> 01:01:07,871
Every inch of the camp
was covered during his pursuit,

755
01:01:07,974 --> 01:01:11,460
which tragically ended here.

756
01:01:11,564 --> 01:01:14,015
The campers were ruthless,

757
01:01:14,118 --> 01:01:17,294
taunting the boy as he lurched
and stumbled

758
01:01:17,397 --> 01:01:18,778
on the rafters above.

759
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:23,438
Having grown exhausted,

760
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:28,270
his eyes blurry from the tears
streaming down his face...

761
01:01:30,721 --> 01:01:32,343
...Roger tripped
on a loose plank.

762
01:01:34,449 --> 01:01:35,830
He flew through that opening

763
01:01:35,933 --> 01:01:39,178
where he plummeted 30 feet
to his death.

764
01:01:42,733 --> 01:01:45,184
Damn.

765
01:01:45,287 --> 01:01:49,326
So a little boy is
murdering everyone in the town.

766
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:51,984
No.

767
01:01:52,881 --> 01:01:55,366
Roger is very much grown now.

768
01:01:57,334 --> 01:01:59,854
And with his machete,
he chops up any teens

769
01:01:59,957 --> 01:02:03,271
foolish enough to visit the camp
where he once died.

770
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:07,275
You know, Abbie,
for a recent transplant,

771
01:02:07,378 --> 01:02:10,209
you sure know a lot
about this boogeyman.

772
01:02:15,041 --> 01:02:17,837
It was my favorite
bedtime story.

773
01:02:18,804 --> 01:02:20,633
Hey.

774
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,808
Ahoy down there.

775
01:02:22,911 --> 01:02:24,637
Are you crazy?

776
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,777
Just looking for
our little ghost boy.

777
01:02:26,881 --> 01:02:28,330
You have to get down.

778
01:02:28,434 --> 01:02:30,505
- Oooh.
- Now.

779
01:02:30,608 --> 01:02:33,991
Ghost boy.

780
01:02:37,443 --> 01:02:38,755
Sam?

781
01:02:44,795 --> 01:02:46,417
Stay down here.

782
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:41,300
Not cool.

783
01:03:41,403 --> 01:03:43,578
Sam? Abbie?

784
01:03:43,681 --> 01:03:44,890
Found her.

785
01:03:44,993 --> 01:03:47,133
We found something, too.

786
01:03:50,965 --> 01:03:54,071
Holy shit.

787
01:03:54,175 --> 01:03:56,315
It's too good to be true.

788
01:04:02,252 --> 01:04:04,599
You're right.
No keys.

789
01:04:04,702 --> 01:04:06,843
Maybe we could hot-wire it.

790
01:04:06,946 --> 01:04:09,776
They make it look pretty easy
in the movies.

791
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,848
We need to get inside.

792
01:04:23,894 --> 01:04:29,244
Okay, whatever we do,
we can't fall asleep.

793
01:04:29,348 --> 01:04:32,040
Don't worry.
I've got us covered.

794
01:04:32,144 --> 01:04:34,146
Uppers to get us
through the night.

795
01:04:47,124 --> 01:04:50,679
No, thanks.
I'm naturally caffeinated.

796
01:04:52,716 --> 01:04:55,132
Okay, just one.

797
01:04:57,238 --> 01:05:00,620
♪ Crashing in
like a waterfall ♪

798
01:05:00,724 --> 01:05:04,038
♪ I know it's not pretty
when I get like this ♪

799
01:05:04,141 --> 01:05:08,214

802
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,325
♪ You put up with it

01:05:15,428 --> 01:05:17,672
♪ But you're not ready for it

804
01:05:19,294 --> 01:05:20,709
Boo!

805
01:05:20,813 --> 01:05:22,919
I hate this slow shit.

806
01:05:23,022 --> 01:05:25,300
No, Billy.
Don't change it.

807
01:05:25,404 --> 01:05:26,612
I love this song.

808
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:31,651
Come on.

809
01:05:46,632 --> 01:05:48,289
You puke on me
and I will kill you

810
01:05:48,392 --> 01:05:50,291
before Bladecut has a chance.

811
01:05:55,572 --> 01:05:58,471

Sam?

817
01:06:19,561 --> 01:06:21,632
Yeah?

818
01:06:21,736 --> 01:06:23,841
Are you sure these are uppers?

819
01:06:26,085 --> 01:06:27,362
I'm pretty sure.

820
01:06:27,466 --> 01:06:29,675
At least,
that's what the label said.

821
01:06:38,201 --> 01:06:40,548
Who sold you the bottle?

822
01:06:41,445 --> 01:06:42,619
Nobody.

823
01:06:42,722 --> 01:06:45,760
I found them
in that car parked in the barn.

824
01:06:45,863 --> 01:06:48,452
Oh, shit.

825
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:04,468
Where's Sam?

826
01:07:04,572 --> 01:07:06,539
Where's Billy?

827
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,596
Oh, my God.

828
01:07:33,497 --> 01:07:35,844
Fuck me.

829
01:07:35,948 --> 01:07:38,433
That's a charred dick.

830
01:07:38,537 --> 01:07:40,608
Oh, Billy.

831
01:07:51,101 --> 01:07:53,241
I found the rest of Billy.

832
01:07:54,898 --> 01:07:56,210
Patty?

833
01:08:04,632 --> 01:08:05,667
Time to go.

834
01:08:20,855 --> 01:08:22,477
I knew it.

835
01:08:23,064 --> 01:08:24,445
Patty.

836
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,344
Now, hold up.

837
01:08:27,448 --> 01:08:29,450
You two know each other?

838
01:08:31,348 --> 01:08:34,386
The weird kid and the new girl.

839
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,322
Look what I found.

840
01:08:41,324 --> 01:08:43,567
That's how you did it.

841
01:08:43,671 --> 01:08:46,812
The two of you
in cahoots together.

842
01:08:48,054 --> 01:08:50,954
You killed them all.

843
01:08:51,057 --> 01:08:53,715
And now you brought us here
to die.

844
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:56,339
I can explain.

845
01:08:58,755 --> 01:09:02,862
All my friends, dead.

846
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:08,523
Please, don't do this.

847
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:12,872
You sick motherfuckers.

848
01:09:34,791 --> 01:09:36,689
Patty?

849
01:09:37,518 --> 01:09:38,760
Shit.

850
01:09:47,217 --> 01:09:48,253
Okay.

851
01:09:48,356 --> 01:09:51,842
Now, stay calm.

852
01:09:51,946 --> 01:09:54,259
This is bad.

853
01:09:54,362 --> 01:09:56,261
This is really bad.

854
01:09:57,089 --> 01:09:59,402
But whatever you do, don't--

855
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:38,786
Wait.

856
01:10:38,889 --> 01:10:40,408
How do you know
he's not the killer?

857
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,791
I know you are, but what am I?

858
01:10:51,799 --> 01:10:52,938
Come on!

859
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:01,464
Come on, Abbie. Come on.
- Go, Abbie.

860
01:11:01,567 --> 01:11:04,087
- Come on.
- Go, go!

861
01:11:16,548 --> 01:11:18,757
Oh, he is so pissed.

862
01:11:19,999 --> 01:11:21,069
Go!

863
01:11:33,979 --> 01:11:35,463
Abbie.

864
01:11:37,776 --> 01:11:39,847
Abbie, you need to keep going.

865
01:11:42,746 --> 01:11:44,058
I-I can't.

866
01:11:44,161 --> 01:11:47,026
What? Why?
Run him the fuck over.

867
01:11:49,235 --> 01:11:50,478
Hey.

868
01:12:09,186 --> 01:12:10,671
Dad, stop!

869
01:12:12,362 --> 01:12:13,570
Dad!

870
01:12:13,674 --> 01:12:16,262
Please, I love her.

871
01:12:16,366 --> 01:12:17,850
She needs to die.

872
01:12:26,825 --> 01:12:28,274
Dad.

873
01:12:49,882 --> 01:12:51,367
Sam!

874
01:12:58,166 --> 01:12:59,754
Say something.

875
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,002
Look at me.

876
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:26,505
Dad?

877
01:13:32,235 --> 01:13:34,133
Sam, I--

878
01:13:35,756 --> 01:13:37,136
Please.

879
01:13:41,037 --> 01:13:42,590
