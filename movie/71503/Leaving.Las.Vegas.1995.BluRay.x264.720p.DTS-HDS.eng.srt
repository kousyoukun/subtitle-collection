1
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,730
- To a wonderful film. You were great.
- Thank you.

2
00:00:49,802 --> 00:00:52,965
- What a romantic you are.
- To the agency and my little protege.

3
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,973
Bless you.
Thank you, daddy.

4
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,574
Eight years at Berlitz,
that's what you learn?

5
00:01:00,647 --> 00:01:02,478
He learned chin the first month
and then chin-chin.

6
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:04,414
Am I right?

7
00:01:04,484 --> 00:01:05,917
I can't be clever.

8
00:01:05,985 --> 00:01:08,078
It was really beautiful,
what you guys did.

9
00:01:08,154 --> 00:01:12,090
It was beautiful,
and you guys are great.

10
00:01:12,158 --> 00:01:13,523
I love the food here.

11
00:01:13,593 --> 00:01:18,087
The nicest thing about the film
is that we get to handle guns.

12
00:01:18,197 --> 00:01:20,131
- I had never done that.
- Peter.

13
00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:21,632
- Very rare.
- What?

14
00:01:21,701 --> 00:01:24,101
- How are you?
- Wow. Ben, how are you?

15
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,104
Outstanding, sir.

16
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:31,706
Excuse me.
Ben Sanderson, Marc Nussbaum.

17
00:01:31,778 --> 00:01:34,042
- Of course.
- How are you?

18
00:01:34,113 --> 00:01:35,876
- Sheila.
- Ladies.

19
00:01:35,949 --> 00:01:38,543
- Hi, Ben.
- Nice to meet you.

20
00:01:38,618 --> 00:01:44,318
I'm a big fan of your writing.
I thought Bay of Pigs was great.

21
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,850
Actually, I didn't write it,
I just got the credit. I was fired.

22
00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:53,399
Didn't I talk to you a couple
of years ago when you both worked...

23
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:56,900
- at MGM with Laddie?
- That's right, by God.

24
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,905
So are you still at ICM?

25
00:01:59,973 --> 00:02:04,069
- I'm at TriStar.
- You're at TriStar.

26
00:02:04,143 --> 00:02:07,909
- You'll have to say hello to Mike.
- I will.

27
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:12,441
He's not there anymore,
but I'll hunt him down.

28
00:02:12,518 --> 00:02:15,419
- Can I talk to you, please?
- Sure.

29
00:02:15,488 --> 00:02:17,251
- Please?
- Be right back.

30
00:02:17,323 --> 00:02:20,884
Hold the fort, kiddo.
I have my own office this way.

31
00:02:20,994 --> 00:02:23,485
- What is the matter with him?
- He's sick.

32
00:02:23,596 --> 00:02:25,894
I can't help you anymore.
Do you understand?

33
00:02:25,965 --> 00:02:30,698
This is the last time. I promise.
I just need some cash tonight.

34
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:34,763
- How are you?
- I lost my credit cards.

35
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:37,708
The money will be on your desk
first thing in the morning.

36
00:02:37,777 --> 00:02:41,713
How's the new one coming along?
I hear you got Dickie Gere.

37
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:45,547
- That is great, man.
- I got everybody in the movie.

38
00:02:45,618 --> 00:02:48,553
Look, you're sick.

39
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:51,055
This is all I have in cash.

40
00:02:51,124 --> 00:02:54,719
Please, don't drink it in here.

41
00:02:55,995 --> 00:02:58,862
- Man.
- That's fine, Peter.

42
00:02:58,931 --> 00:03:01,399
I'll messenger it over to you
in the morning.

43
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:04,402
I don't want it.

44
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,736
I think it would be the best thing
if you don't contact me again.

45
00:03:18,484 --> 00:03:21,510
- What's your name?
- Terri.

46
00:03:21,587 --> 00:03:24,522
- Terri, I am going to buy you a drink.
- I'm okay. Thanks.

47
00:03:26,993 --> 00:03:30,724
Bud, please. Buy the lady a drink
and another one for you.

48
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,162
I'm Benjamin. Ben.

49
00:03:33,232 --> 00:03:36,531
Benny Goodman, that's me.
I think you're sexy. That's right.

50
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:40,038
Look at those eyes.
Sexy like a kitty cat.

51
00:03:40,106 --> 00:03:42,199
You turn me on

52
00:03:44,277 --> 00:03:46,370
You're not too tall
You're not too short

53
00:03:46,446 --> 00:03:48,209
You're not too round

54
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:51,910
You're like a cat
The cat in the hat

55
00:03:51,984 --> 00:03:54,384
Look at those eyes.
Honest to God.

56
00:03:54,454 --> 00:03:57,048
You're luminescent, baby.
What?

57
00:03:57,123 --> 00:04:00,889
- You've been drinking all day.
- Of course.

58
00:04:00,993 --> 00:04:03,553
Speaking of drinks,
here is yours.

59
00:04:03,663 --> 00:04:05,096
- Thanks.
- Down that hatch.

60
00:04:05,164 --> 00:04:07,598
And here is mine.
Cheers. Come on.

61
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:11,068
There we go.
Let's do it to it.

62
00:04:15,808 --> 00:04:19,403
I just thought
of an amazing concept.

63
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:21,606
What do you say
we finish these...

64
00:04:21,681 --> 00:04:24,741
and we go back
to my apartment on the beach!

65
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:27,149
I'll throw a movie in the VCR...

66
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,087
and mix you up
a gooey blender drink.

67
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:31,487
Sound good? Sound sexy?

68
00:04:45,438 --> 00:04:47,804
Bud, give me another.

69
00:04:50,576 --> 00:04:55,878
I really wish you'd come home with me.
You're so cute.

70
00:04:55,948 --> 00:04:58,746
I'm really good in bed too.
Believe me.

71
00:05:00,586 --> 00:05:03,885
And you smell great...

72
00:05:03,956 --> 00:05:06,891
and you look great
and your hair's great.

73
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:15,164
Look, I've got to wake up early
in the morning.

74
00:05:15,234 --> 00:05:18,726
I have to go. Thank you.

75
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:27,506
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.

76
00:05:30,249 --> 00:05:32,979
Maybe I shouldn't breathe so much.

77
00:05:40,793 --> 00:05:43,819
That's it, pal.
We're closing up now.

78
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,898
I'm gonna finish this.

79
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:19,581
Hey, Mr. Erection,
you want a date?

80
00:07:20,793 --> 00:07:23,887
The room is 20.
You pay for it.

81
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:27,695
But only because I think...

82
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:33,034
that the concept of surrender...

83
00:07:33,105 --> 00:07:37,701
fits with the big picture right now.

84
00:07:41,948 --> 00:07:44,508
Hey, get outta the street!

85
00:07:50,056 --> 00:07:55,358
I don't remember
if I started drinking...

86
00:07:55,461 --> 00:07:58,191
because my wife left me or...

87
00:07:58,297 --> 00:08:02,529
my wife left me
'cause I started drinking.

88
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:04,535
Fuck it anyway!

89
00:09:03,062 --> 00:09:04,529
Next, please.

90
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:13,704
One moment, sir.

91
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,135
Sign the back
of the check, please.

92
00:09:21,747 --> 00:09:26,707
- Can't you just cash it as it is?
- Is there a problem?

93
00:09:38,597 --> 00:09:40,690
I'm a little shaky right now.

94
00:09:43,402 --> 00:09:45,336
I had brain surgery.

95
00:09:45,404 --> 00:09:49,500
I'll go get some lunch,
and then I'll come back...

96
00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:52,066
and take care of it then.

97
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,180
Next I'll have a gin and tonic.

98
00:10:02,788 --> 00:10:05,222
Do you know what time it is?

99
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,723
You should be drinking coffee.

100
00:10:09,795 --> 00:10:11,558
You're a young guy.

101
00:10:15,134 --> 00:10:18,865
It's none of my business...

102
00:10:18,938 --> 00:10:23,204
but if you could see
what I see...

103
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:25,709
you wouldn't be doing this
to yourself.

104
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:35,687
I understand
what you're saying.

105
00:10:35,754 --> 00:10:38,518
I appreciate your concern.

106
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:42,987
It's not my intention
to make you uncomfortable.

107
00:10:44,597 --> 00:10:49,500
Please, serve me today,
and I'll never come in here again.

108
00:10:49,568 --> 00:10:51,661
If I do, you can 86 me.

109
00:10:51,737 --> 00:10:53,671
Stop fucking with me!

110
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,174
I can 86 you anytime I want to.

111
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:15,727
I don't give a fuck what you do.

112
00:11:15,794 --> 00:11:18,820
That one's on the house, son.

113
00:11:18,898 --> 00:11:20,729
Were you in Los Angeles
for the earthquake?

114
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,063
- It was pretty scary.
- Did you have a lot of damage?

115
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:26,696
- Just a little bit.
- Are you desirable?

116
00:11:26,772 --> 00:11:29,468
Are you irresistible?

117
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:32,807
Maybe if you drank bourbon with me,
it would help.

118
00:11:32,878 --> 00:11:37,406
If you kissed me, and I could taste
the sting in your mouth, it would help.

119
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:39,177
If you drank bourbon with me naked...

120
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:43,153
if you smelled of bourbon
as you fucked me, it would help.

121
00:11:43,222 --> 00:11:46,316
It would increase
my esteem for you...

122
00:11:46,392 --> 00:11:51,125
if you poured bourbon on your naked body
and said to me, "Drink this."

123
00:11:51,197 --> 00:11:56,294
If you spread your legs and you had
bourbon dripping from your breasts...

124
00:11:56,368 --> 00:12:00,134
and your pussy and said,
"Drink here"...

125
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,333
then I could
fall in love with you.

126
00:12:03,409 --> 00:12:06,845
Because then I would have a purpose:
To clean you up.

127
00:12:06,912 --> 00:12:11,246
And that would prove...

128
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,716
that I'm worth something.

129
00:12:13,786 --> 00:12:19,383
I'd lick you clean so that you could
go away and fuck someone else.

130
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,392
Our business is
to make our customers happy.

131
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:25,424
Next, please.

132
00:12:26,865 --> 00:12:28,765
I am back.

133
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:32,600
I've got my check,
and, baby, I'm ready to sign.

134
00:12:35,774 --> 00:12:37,469
There.

135
00:12:38,811 --> 00:12:41,871
Steady as a fucking rock.
Excuse my French.

136
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:45,974
Want to have dinner with me?

137
00:12:47,453 --> 00:12:50,980
But what's the back end like?

138
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:54,389
By the time we're through
with P and A...

139
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,327
the "above the line"
is gonna take it to about 15.

140
00:12:57,396 --> 00:13:00,365
With something like this,
what would Disney think?

141
00:13:02,434 --> 00:13:03,833
Messages.

142
00:13:03,902 --> 00:13:06,166
What did Diller say?

143
00:13:07,406 --> 00:13:10,000
Listen, I'm very busy.
Just kidding.

144
00:13:10,075 --> 00:13:12,669
Can I call you back on this?

145
00:13:12,745 --> 00:13:15,179
Ciao for now.

146
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:17,715
Could somebody fix the phones
around here?

147
00:13:17,783 --> 00:13:20,115
- Good morning.
- Mr. Simpson's looking for you.

148
00:13:20,185 --> 00:13:22,085
He wants you to go in
as soon as you get...

149
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:30,323
- Are you all right?
- Outstanding.

150
00:13:30,396 --> 00:13:36,130
But I have to go
to a very important meeting.

151
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:38,635
Could make a couple million
for the company.

152
00:13:45,044 --> 00:13:46,477
What?

153
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:52,349
You should go in there now.

154
00:13:59,425 --> 00:14:02,360
- Hi, Bill.
- Take a seat.

155
00:14:12,237 --> 00:14:15,035
We're gonna let you go.

156
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:40,159
This is too generous, Bill.

157
00:14:44,036 --> 00:14:48,598
We really liked having you around,
but you know how it is.

158
00:14:48,674 --> 00:14:50,301
I'm sorry.

159
00:14:54,546 --> 00:14:58,004
What are you gonna do now?

160
00:15:03,922 --> 00:15:05,514
I thought...

161
00:15:07,593 --> 00:15:10,528
I thought
I'd move out to Las Vegas.

162
00:15:37,556 --> 00:15:39,990
My name is Yuri Botsov.

163
00:15:40,058 --> 00:15:42,151
Where you from, Yuri?

164
00:15:42,227 --> 00:15:45,719
You sure don't sound like you come
from around these parts.

165
00:15:45,798 --> 00:15:48,323
That is very true.

166
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,766
Very good observation.
I am from Latvia.

167
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:54,434
Very tough place.

168
00:15:54,506 --> 00:15:57,964
I hear this,
but I am not a tough man.

169
00:15:58,043 --> 00:16:02,446
I am a humble man who is here to learn
from my friends in the New World.

170
00:16:26,238 --> 00:16:28,934
This must be Yuri's friend.

171
00:16:29,007 --> 00:16:32,738
Sera is my gift to you all.

172
00:16:34,112 --> 00:16:36,273
You will find her a very willing girl
for each of you...

173
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:38,440
just as we arranged.

174
00:16:40,185 --> 00:16:45,157
So, I have business to attend.
Please, enjoy.

175
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:57,935
Do you wanna watch?

176
00:17:52,157 --> 00:17:54,091
Are you scared?

177
00:18:01,366 --> 00:18:03,266
It's all right.

178
00:18:05,003 --> 00:18:06,937
It's okay.

179
00:18:18,684 --> 00:18:21,278
I bring out the best
in the men who fuck me.

180
00:18:21,353 --> 00:18:23,947
It's not easy,
but I'm very good.

181
00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:27,549
It's amazing. I haven't worked
for a really long time...

182
00:18:27,626 --> 00:18:30,220
and I can just turn on a dime.

183
00:18:30,295 --> 00:18:32,490
I can just become
who they want me to be.

184
00:18:32,564 --> 00:18:35,226
I walk into that room,
I know right away...

185
00:18:35,334 --> 00:18:37,529
this is their fantasy,
and I become it.

186
00:18:37,636 --> 00:18:41,902
I'm that service.
I perform it, and I perform it well.

187
00:18:41,974 --> 00:18:43,407
I'm an equation mostly.

188
00:18:43,475 --> 00:18:48,742
Thirty minutes of my body
costs $300.

189
00:18:48,814 --> 00:18:51,078
That's just to get into the room.

190
00:18:51,149 --> 00:18:54,585
It's about $500 after that.
We negotiate.

191
00:18:54,653 --> 00:18:57,383
But it's a performance.

192
00:18:57,456 --> 00:18:59,981
It's definitely a performance.

193
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:03,755
I am very pleased with how
you've moved up in the world.

194
00:19:03,829 --> 00:19:07,526
It is, after all,
a glamorous world I showed you.

195
00:19:11,303 --> 00:19:14,932
Why did you leave me
in Los Angeles?

196
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:19,443
Because you are sly.

197
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:23,613
You knew there was more money
here in Las Vegas.

198
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:30,613
You don't need to fear me, Sera...

199
00:19:30,689 --> 00:19:32,953
because we belong together.

200
00:19:34,192 --> 00:19:36,456
Don't we?

201
00:19:47,506 --> 00:19:51,272
- Are you lonely?
- I am lonely, Yuri.

202
00:19:51,343 --> 00:19:53,106
So am I.

203
00:22:19,424 --> 00:22:23,758
Janek, we called you last night!

204
00:22:23,829 --> 00:22:26,059
There was no one home.

205
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:31,899
We're 30 miles
outside of Las Vegas.

206
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:36,907
Someone saw him there yesterday.

207
00:22:40,812 --> 00:22:43,804
No, this is the end of it!

208
00:22:43,882 --> 00:22:48,376
Yuri knew what he was doing.

209
00:23:16,615 --> 00:23:18,913
That was a red light.

210
00:23:18,984 --> 00:23:20,918
I walk, you stop.

211
00:23:21,853 --> 00:23:24,117
Are you sorry?

212
00:23:24,189 --> 00:23:26,157
Good.

213
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,171
Three towels in each room
and a complimentary bar of soap.

214
00:23:51,249 --> 00:23:56,209
If you run out of soap,
you can buy an extra bar.

215
00:23:56,288 --> 00:23:58,848
Feel free to use our pool,
but use it at your own risk.

216
00:23:58,924 --> 00:24:02,052
- There are three towels in your room.
- Do you have vacancies?

217
00:24:03,128 --> 00:24:05,562
We do.
I'll be with you in a minute.

218
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:09,566
Linens are provided for you.
Rooms are $29 a night.

219
00:24:09,634 --> 00:24:13,695
You pay at the beginning of each week.
Maid service is optional.

220
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:23,575
Maid service is optional.
It costs $3.50 a day.

221
00:24:23,648 --> 00:24:26,742
Feel free to use the pool,
but use it at your own risk.

222
00:24:26,818 --> 00:24:28,911
We don't have a lifeguard.

223
00:24:28,987 --> 00:24:33,924
No kids, no pets and no guests
after 11:00 at night.

224
00:24:33,992 --> 00:24:35,926
You've been provided
with three towels.

225
00:24:35,994 --> 00:24:39,930
We expect when you check out
there will still be three towels.

226
00:24:39,998 --> 00:24:41,829
There's a complimentary
bar of soap.

227
00:24:43,168 --> 00:24:46,660
I walked into the room,
and he was lying on the bed.

228
00:24:46,738 --> 00:24:50,003
He had his arms
behind his head...

229
00:24:50,075 --> 00:24:53,511
and there was
just hair everywhere.

230
00:24:53,578 --> 00:24:56,376
He was really, really fat.

231
00:24:56,448 --> 00:24:58,780
He had a large erection.

232
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:03,480
I remember he was so proud
of his large erection.

233
00:25:07,325 --> 00:25:11,659
I asked him where my money was,
and he pointed to the dresser.

234
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,494
And then I asked him
what he wanted...

235
00:25:14,566 --> 00:25:19,970
and he said,
"Lie down, I'm on top."

236
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:25,476
He started pounding me
really hard.

237
00:25:26,711 --> 00:25:30,647
I had to bite my tongue
to keep from crying.

238
00:25:32,217 --> 00:25:36,313
He did that for awhile,
and then I started to get up.

239
00:25:36,388 --> 00:25:41,155
He pushed me back down,
and he held my hair.

240
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:46,697
He was pulling it,
and he stuck his penis in my mouth.

241
00:25:46,765 --> 00:25:52,260
I tried to get up again,
and he said...

242
00:25:52,337 --> 00:25:57,331
"Stay there, baby,
I'm gonna come on your face."

243
00:25:57,409 --> 00:26:00,936
So he did.

244
00:26:01,012 --> 00:26:04,948
Then he rubbed his semen
all over my face and in my hair.

245
00:26:08,153 --> 00:26:13,216
Then he kicked me off the bed
and told me to leave.

246
00:26:45,023 --> 00:26:48,049
- Are you working?
- What do you mean? I'm walking.

247
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,128
Just wait one second.

248
00:26:52,063 --> 00:26:53,496
Great ass!

249
00:26:57,035 --> 00:27:00,562
- Want some?
- Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?

250
00:27:03,975 --> 00:27:05,909
That's pretty funny.

251
00:27:05,977 --> 00:27:09,572
I wonder if you'll take $250
to fuck me?

252
00:27:11,483 --> 00:27:14,919
That is, if you'll come
to my room for one hour...

253
00:27:14,986 --> 00:27:17,250
I will give you $500.

254
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:22,592
- You're pretty drunk.
- Not really.

255
00:27:22,694 --> 00:27:25,219
My room's not far.
It's The Whole Year Inn.

256
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:29,357
You could drive with me if you want
or we could walk.

257
00:27:30,635 --> 00:27:32,068
Or I could give you cab fare.

258
00:27:32,137 --> 00:27:33,729
- In the car.
- Whatever you want.

259
00:27:33,805 --> 00:27:36,239
Why don't you give me the money
in the car?

260
00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:46,410
I'm Ben.

261
00:27:46,985 --> 00:27:48,748
I'm Sera.

262
00:27:58,696 --> 00:28:01,688
Sarah with an "H"?

263
00:28:03,101 --> 00:28:06,366
With an "E." S-e-r-a.

264
00:28:11,276 --> 00:28:13,210
You wanna start the engine?

265
00:28:31,996 --> 00:28:34,430
What this room needs
is more booze.

266
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:38,393
- Can I use the bathroom?
- Of course.

267
00:28:39,804 --> 00:28:42,671
Want a drink?
I'm having one.

268
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,403
Sure. I'll have a shot of tequila,
if you can spare it.

269
00:29:12,604 --> 00:29:14,162
Your drink's here.

270
00:29:22,113 --> 00:29:26,049
For 500 bucks, you can do
pretty much whatever you want.

271
00:29:26,117 --> 00:29:29,917
- You can fuck my ass.
- Oh, my God.

272
00:29:29,988 --> 00:29:35,790
You can come on my face.
Whatever you want to do.

273
00:29:35,893 --> 00:29:40,592
Just keep it out of my hair.
I just washed it.

274
00:30:02,053 --> 00:30:06,649
Just because my feet
were too big in the morning

275
00:30:06,724 --> 00:30:11,127
Just because I can't remember
your mother's name

276
00:30:11,195 --> 00:30:17,566
Just because I put the octopus
in the bed

277
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:22,504
Just because, because
because, because Bill Cosby

278
00:30:26,377 --> 00:30:28,368
You wanna fuck now?

279
00:30:31,149 --> 00:30:35,552
Maybe something to drink first.
More tequila?

280
00:30:36,487 --> 00:30:38,011
Whatever.

281
00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:18,659
What's the story?
Are you too drunk to come?

282
00:31:20,598 --> 00:31:23,726
I don't care about any of that.

283
00:31:27,972 --> 00:31:33,569
There's time left.
You can have more money.

284
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:36,579
You can drink all you want.

285
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:39,741
Just stay.
That's what I want.

286
00:31:39,817 --> 00:31:44,845
I want you to talk or listen.

287
00:31:44,922 --> 00:31:46,412
Just stay.

288
00:32:04,942 --> 00:32:08,708
So, Ben with an "N"...

289
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,941
what brings you to Las Vegas?

290
00:32:11,015 --> 00:32:12,539
Business convention?

291
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:25,919
I came here
to drink myself to death.

292
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,900
Cashed in all my money...

293
00:32:32,937 --> 00:32:35,030
gonna sell the car tomorrow.

294
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:41,710
How long is it gonna take
for you to...

295
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:44,213
drink yourself to death?

296
00:32:48,986 --> 00:32:52,979
I think about four weeks.

297
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,558
I don't know for sure,
but I think.

298
00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:01,428
I got enough
for about 250, $300 a day.

299
00:33:01,499 --> 00:33:03,399
That should do it.

300
00:33:04,936 --> 00:33:07,734
What am I? A luxury?

301
00:33:10,675 --> 00:33:14,441
You're a luxury,
and your meter just ran out.

302
00:33:14,512 --> 00:33:16,673
That's a nice watch.

303
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:19,238
You do like it?

304
00:33:22,386 --> 00:33:25,355
You can talk
a little bit more.

305
00:33:25,456 --> 00:33:27,720
I don't have to be anywhere.

306
00:33:29,126 --> 00:33:30,559
Talk.

307
00:33:32,129 --> 00:33:34,222
In Los Angeles...

308
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:39,227
I kept running out of booze
and the store would be closed...

309
00:33:39,303 --> 00:33:42,431
because I forget
to look at my watch.

310
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:49,544
I used to live in Los Angeles.

311
00:33:53,985 --> 00:33:56,317
But I don't anymore.

312
00:33:58,422 --> 00:34:01,585
I think the tough times
are finally behind me.

313
00:34:03,928 --> 00:34:08,888
There'll always
be bad things, but...

314
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:11,264
my life is good.

315
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,768
It is as I want it to be.

316
00:34:18,276 --> 00:34:20,574
It's good.

317
00:34:23,848 --> 00:34:27,978
It's good being here with you.

318
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:47,027
Shit.

319
00:35:05,656 --> 00:35:08,921
Hey, Bill.
How are you?

320
00:35:25,076 --> 00:35:27,010
Is this a full night's work?

321
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,507
I'm really sorry.

322
00:35:31,582 --> 00:35:34,779
It was such a slow night,
and I couldn't score.

323
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:42,221
What do you think?

324
00:35:42,293 --> 00:35:45,262
You're just a 16-year-old girl
on Hollywood Boulevard?

325
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:48,230
Is that what you think?
Is that what you play?

326
00:36:01,779 --> 00:36:03,371
Here.

327
00:36:07,652 --> 00:36:09,119
Go ahead.

328
00:36:30,641 --> 00:36:33,667
I could kill you, Sera.

329
00:36:37,081 --> 00:36:39,675
You work tonight,
and you bring me the money.

330
00:36:39,784 --> 00:36:41,877
It doesn't matter how late.

331
00:36:42,987 --> 00:36:45,387
I will.

332
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:52,387
He cut me a couple of times.

333
00:36:52,463 --> 00:36:57,025
He'd always say,
"Never on the face."

334
00:36:59,603 --> 00:37:01,901
So, he cut me right here.

335
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:07,209
He cried...

336
00:37:07,278 --> 00:37:12,477
and I felt sorry for him.

337
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:14,813
In his mind,
I'd done something bad...

338
00:37:14,919 --> 00:37:18,480
but in my mind
I hadn't done anything bad.

339
00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:20,682
He's kind of paranoid.

340
00:37:31,669 --> 00:37:34,137
This ring is a ruby.
It's my lucky ring.

341
00:37:34,205 --> 00:37:36,833
This watch is real gold.
It's not plated.

342
00:37:36,907 --> 00:37:39,273
It's the real thing.
Feel how heavy it is.

343
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:44,303
- These rings, $3,000.
- One thousand.

344
00:37:44,381 --> 00:37:47,373
One thousand?
Look what you're getting.

345
00:37:47,485 --> 00:37:50,613
It's a ruby. It's my lucky ring.
It's a beautiful thing.

346
00:37:50,721 --> 00:37:53,884
I can put that in.
Two thousand dollars.

347
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:58,895
- I can't give you more than a thousand.
- But I just added the ring.

348
00:37:58,963 --> 00:38:01,124
- Synthetic ruby.
- Look...

349
00:38:01,198 --> 00:38:03,428
What can I do for you?

350
00:38:11,442 --> 00:38:13,433
Five hundred.

351
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:21,447
Five hundred dollars
for a 1993 Rolex Daytona watch.

352
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:24,987
I'll do it.

353
00:38:29,527 --> 00:38:33,361
- How are you doin'?
- I'm doing fine, thank you.

354
00:38:35,866 --> 00:38:38,994
Are you here for the convention?

355
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:41,094
I didn't think I was that obvious.

356
00:38:42,907 --> 00:38:47,776
- It was just a wild guess.
- My name's Paul, honey.

357
00:38:50,247 --> 00:38:53,341
- Vodka Seven.
- And for the lady?

358
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,918
- Are you ready for another one?
- Sure.

359
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,181
- I'll have a margarita.
- Good choice.

360
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:03,021
Are you alone?

361
00:39:04,195 --> 00:39:06,823
Or are you using me
to make someone jealous?

362
00:39:06,897 --> 00:39:09,832
Alone. I'm here alone.

363
00:39:11,068 --> 00:39:12,933
Thank you.

364
00:39:14,171 --> 00:39:16,105
Cheers.

365
00:39:18,542 --> 00:39:21,136
Where are you staying?

366
00:39:21,212 --> 00:39:23,476
Right here at the hotel.
Why?

367
00:39:24,915 --> 00:39:27,475
I thought
you might be looking for a date.

368
00:39:27,585 --> 00:39:31,021
"A date"?
What are you, a hooker?

369
00:39:31,088 --> 00:39:33,579
What exactly do you mean
by a date?

370
00:39:33,691 --> 00:39:35,852
I got a wife waiting
for me at home.

371
00:39:35,926 --> 00:39:39,862
- I just came over to talk.
- I'm sorry. I guess I misunderstood.

372
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:42,660
- I guess you did.
- Just keep your voice down.

373
00:39:42,733 --> 00:39:44,997
I won't bother you again.

374
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,732
Here, have another one on me.

375
00:39:48,806 --> 00:39:50,330
Christ.

376
00:39:54,078 --> 00:39:56,842
Maybe you should give it a miss
for tonight.

377
00:40:05,789 --> 00:40:08,986
I don't know, it's just...

378
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:13,052
I really like this guy.
I've never felt anything...

379
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:18,869
for anyone I've ever been with,
as a trick.

380
00:40:19,003 --> 00:40:21,938
It's weird.
I feel kind of confused about it.

381
00:40:22,006 --> 00:40:24,440
We were with each other
only one night...

382
00:40:24,508 --> 00:40:26,703
but I felt like
the relationship...

383
00:40:26,777 --> 00:40:31,043
I felt like there was
a relationship being formed.

384
00:40:31,115 --> 00:40:33,083
I was kind of scared.

385
00:40:36,287 --> 00:40:38,551
I don't think
I should see him again.

386
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,621
But I look for him.

387
00:40:43,594 --> 00:40:47,621
I went out last night.
I was looking for him.

388
00:41:05,316 --> 00:41:07,443
Where's your car?

389
00:41:07,518 --> 00:41:10,078
I sold it this morning.

390
00:41:11,322 --> 00:41:13,790
I'm gonna take cabs from now on.

391
00:41:16,126 --> 00:41:20,790
What's it tonight?
Another 500 to watch you sleep?

392
00:41:26,937 --> 00:41:30,395
- What's up?
- I was looking for you tonight.

393
00:41:30,474 --> 00:41:34,376
I don't know
if you have a boyfriend...

394
00:41:34,445 --> 00:41:37,209
or a girlfriend...

395
00:41:37,281 --> 00:41:41,217
but, if you have
some free time...

396
00:41:41,285 --> 00:41:45,881
I thought maybe
we could get some dinner.

397
00:41:48,392 --> 00:41:50,326
Are you serious?

398
00:41:51,462 --> 00:41:54,795
I think you know I'm serious.

399
00:41:57,134 --> 00:42:02,401
I'll pay you if you like,
but I just want to see you.

400
00:42:14,251 --> 00:42:17,015
I can't have dinner with you.

401
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:24,351
We could get prime rib.

402
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:29,190
They've got it on sale for $2.99.

403
00:42:33,771 --> 00:42:35,705
I love that dress.

404
00:43:23,754 --> 00:43:26,848
I had a really good night.

405
00:43:29,126 --> 00:43:32,562
I think things
are finally picking up.

406
00:43:32,629 --> 00:43:35,598
We made so much money.
Look.

407
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:37,360
Come here.

408
00:43:58,455 --> 00:44:02,391
Now listen.
Do you hear?

409
00:44:03,827 --> 00:44:06,887
They're talking about me.

410
00:44:23,614 --> 00:44:26,014
Are you all right?

411
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:36,324
Get out.

412
00:44:44,801 --> 00:44:49,431
Do not come back here.
I'll not see you again.

413
00:45:57,441 --> 00:46:00,035
Do you still wanna have dinner?

414
00:46:37,748 --> 00:46:40,842
I think I put too much salt on it.

415
00:46:42,753 --> 00:46:45,517
- It's not good.
- It's good.

416
00:46:53,297 --> 00:46:58,701
- Why are you a drunk?
- Why am I a drunk?

417
00:46:58,769 --> 00:47:01,294
Is that really
what you want to ask me?

418
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:11,706
Then this is our first date
or our last.

419
00:47:11,782 --> 00:47:14,216
Until now,
I wasn't sure it was either.

420
00:47:17,921 --> 00:47:20,219
First.

421
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:22,224
It's our first.

422
00:47:23,727 --> 00:47:26,195
I just wanna know.

423
00:47:26,296 --> 00:47:28,890
Why are you killing yourself?

424
00:47:29,966 --> 00:47:32,332
Interesting choice of words.

425
00:47:34,404 --> 00:47:39,501
I don't remember.
I just know that I want to.

426
00:47:39,576 --> 00:47:42,044
Is your drinking a way
to kill yourself?

427
00:47:42,112 --> 00:47:45,816
- Or killing myself is a way to drink.
- Very clever.

428
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:51,052
Shoot.

429
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:55,024
Can I have another one?

430
00:48:17,214 --> 00:48:20,672
What are you thinking?
Are you angry?

431
00:48:46,977 --> 00:48:48,808
Good night.

432
00:48:52,416 --> 00:48:56,682
- I had the most wonderful...
- Why don't you stay at my place tonight?

433
00:48:58,755 --> 00:49:01,747
Look, you're pretty drunk.

434
00:49:01,825 --> 00:49:07,695
- I like you. I trust you.
- Wow. That's astonishing, Sera.

435
00:49:07,764 --> 00:49:10,232
I hate to think of you
in that cheesy motel.

436
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:14,066
I'll move to a real smart hotel tomorrow
if it makes you feel better.

437
00:49:16,072 --> 00:49:20,509
Let's talk about tomorrow.
Do you want to do something?

438
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:24,512
We'll talk about it tonight
at my place.

439
00:49:26,883 --> 00:49:29,750
I'm not much good in the sack.

440
00:49:31,388 --> 00:49:33,822
It's not about sex.

441
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:36,324
I'll make you up a bed
on the sofa.

442
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:39,954
We'll talk till late.
We'll sleep till late.

443
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:42,931
As you know,
I am my own boss.

444
00:49:46,536 --> 00:49:48,527
Do it, Ben.

445
00:49:55,045 --> 00:49:56,672
I'll do it.

446
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,994
This is the home of an angel.

447
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:25,002
- Are you okay?
- Of course.

448
00:50:27,444 --> 00:50:30,538
You look extremely beautiful.

449
00:50:32,782 --> 00:50:34,647
I do?

450
00:50:49,332 --> 00:50:54,201
It's really weird because...

451
00:50:54,304 --> 00:50:56,033
you know...

452
00:50:56,139 --> 00:50:58,869
it's just like
this thing's happening...

453
00:50:58,975 --> 00:51:00,909
really quickly.

454
00:51:02,646 --> 00:51:05,206
I just don't know
what's going on.

455
00:51:05,282 --> 00:51:09,082
Just the second I met him,
and the way I said my name.

456
00:51:09,152 --> 00:51:13,521
I just said, "Hi, my name's Sera,"
and that's not what I do.

457
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:16,184
And it's just...

458
00:51:16,259 --> 00:51:18,853
It's all happening really quickly.

459
00:51:18,929 --> 00:51:22,831
I just felt like
we've been together for a long time.

460
00:51:22,899 --> 00:51:25,993
It just felt so easy...

461
00:51:26,069 --> 00:51:29,334
and I felt like...

462
00:51:29,439 --> 00:51:31,873
I felt like I was me.

463
00:51:31,942 --> 00:51:34,376
I didn't feel like I was...

464
00:51:35,612 --> 00:51:37,375
trying to be somebody else.

465
00:52:02,305 --> 00:52:04,967
When is your rent coming up
at the motel?

466
00:52:05,075 --> 00:52:07,009
What do you mean?

467
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:14,676
I think you should go
and bring all your stuff over here.

468
00:52:21,858 --> 00:52:25,794
- Sera, you are crazy.
- So?

469
00:52:25,862 --> 00:52:29,229
Don't you think you'll get
a little bored living with a drunk?

470
00:52:31,601 --> 00:52:36,834
- That's what I want.
- You haven't seen the worst of it.

471
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:40,307
These last few days,
I've been very controlled.

472
00:52:40,377 --> 00:52:44,473
I knock things over
and throw up all the time.

473
00:52:47,884 --> 00:52:51,820
Right now I feel really good.

474
00:52:54,858 --> 00:52:59,921
You're like an antidote that mixes
with the liquor and keeps me in balance.

475
00:52:59,996 --> 00:53:03,227
But that won't last forever.

476
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,538
All right,
you go back to your motel.

477
00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:16,443
I'll go back to my glamorous life
of being alone.

478
00:53:20,483 --> 00:53:24,010
The only thing I have to come home to
is a bottle of mouthwash...

479
00:53:24,087 --> 00:53:26,555
to take the taste
of come out of my mouth.

480
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:33,185
I'm tired of being alone.
That's what I'm tired of.

481
00:53:55,351 --> 00:53:58,286
Don't you like me, Ben?

482
00:54:02,125 --> 00:54:05,094
What you don't understand is...
No. See? No.

483
00:54:05,161 --> 00:54:06,856
What?

484
00:54:10,366 --> 00:54:15,827
You can never, never...

485
00:54:15,905 --> 00:54:18,339
ask me to stop drinking.

486
00:54:19,909 --> 00:54:22,639
Do you understand?

487
00:54:24,914 --> 00:54:27,178
I do.

488
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:28,979
I really do.

489
00:54:50,106 --> 00:54:53,439
I'm nuts about you.

490
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,558
We didn't know...

491
00:55:33,668 --> 00:55:36,136
- whether to call the police.
- He has been here about half an hour.

492
00:55:36,238 --> 00:55:40,504
- I know that...
- Mickey had seen you two together.

493
00:55:40,575 --> 00:55:43,840
I wasn't opening the door.
I don't know who, I don't know where...

494
00:55:43,912 --> 00:55:47,177
I don't know what,
I don't know whatever these days.

495
00:55:47,249 --> 00:55:52,812
He's my friend. I'm sorry.
He must have had too much to drink.

496
00:55:52,888 --> 00:55:57,655
That's why I had him patch the key code.
Because he's not gonna do it.

497
00:55:57,726 --> 00:55:59,489
I'll help him inside.
Thank you so much.

498
00:55:59,561 --> 00:56:01,654
- I'm so sorry to bother you.
- No trouble.

499
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:05,166
You just give me a call
if you need any help.

500
00:56:05,267 --> 00:56:07,929
Ben, can you wake up?

501
00:56:13,275 --> 00:56:17,473
We gotta go inside,
but I have some presents for you.

502
00:56:17,546 --> 00:56:19,036
Up we go.

503
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:23,645
- Here we go.
- This is Mrs. Van Houten.

504
00:56:23,718 --> 00:56:25,310
This is Ben.

505
00:56:25,387 --> 00:56:26,945
Outstanding, sir.

506
00:56:27,022 --> 00:56:29,786
All right.
Here we go.

507
00:56:29,858 --> 00:56:31,621
- You're okay?
- I'm fine.

508
00:56:31,693 --> 00:56:34,457
- Good.
- I'm so sorry to bother you.

509
00:56:34,529 --> 00:56:37,464
- Thank you for being so nice.
- Sure.

510
00:56:37,566 --> 00:56:40,501
- All right.
- Bye-bye.

511
00:56:43,071 --> 00:56:46,370
Sorry.
I was miles away.

512
00:56:48,076 --> 00:56:49,509
The gifts.

513
00:56:52,581 --> 00:56:54,515
I love that name.

514
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:02,156
Before we proceed onwards,
there's something I have to say.

515
00:57:06,561 --> 00:57:11,157
I've come this far.
Here I am, in your house.

516
00:57:12,434 --> 00:57:16,894
- Let me pay this month's rent.
- Why?

517
00:57:18,006 --> 00:57:19,496
Because...

518
00:57:20,609 --> 00:57:23,737
Because it's better for me
that way.

519
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:35,383
I'll tell you right now...

520
00:57:35,457 --> 00:57:37,618
I'm in love with you.

521
00:57:43,198 --> 00:57:46,827
But, be that as it may,
I am not here...

522
00:57:46,935 --> 00:57:51,702
to force my twisted soul
into your life.

523
00:57:51,773 --> 00:57:54,173
I know that.

524
00:57:54,242 --> 00:57:57,006
We both know I'm a drunk.

525
00:57:59,114 --> 00:58:01,173
And I know you're a hooker.

526
00:58:02,584 --> 00:58:05,144
I hope you understand
that I'm a person...

527
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:07,814
who is totally
at ease with this...

528
00:58:07,889 --> 00:58:12,121
which is not to say that
I'm indifferent or I don't care.

529
00:58:12,193 --> 00:58:14,320
I do.

530
00:58:14,396 --> 00:58:18,457
It simply means I trust
and accept your judgment.

531
00:58:20,402 --> 00:58:23,633
I was really worried
about how that would be...

532
00:58:23,705 --> 00:58:26,469
but now I'm not.

533
00:58:31,646 --> 00:58:33,978
But you should know that included
with the rent around here...

534
00:58:34,049 --> 00:58:36,176
is a complimentary blow job.

535
00:58:40,021 --> 00:58:42,387
I suppose sooner or later
we ought to fuck.

536
00:58:44,859 --> 00:58:46,793
Whatever that means.

537
00:58:49,464 --> 00:58:52,558
- Open your presents.
- Presents!

538
00:58:56,237 --> 00:58:57,670
All right.

539
00:58:59,374 --> 00:59:01,342
Open this one first.

540
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:12,644
Very nice.

541
00:59:14,789 --> 00:59:17,656
This should go very nicely
with my suit...

542
00:59:17,726 --> 00:59:19,921
which, by the way,
is the only item of clothing...

543
00:59:19,995 --> 00:59:23,431
I brought over
from the motel with me.

544
00:59:23,498 --> 00:59:26,160
Right.
The suitcase was clinking.

545
00:59:26,267 --> 00:59:28,132
What did you do
with your clothes?

546
00:59:28,203 --> 00:59:32,196
I threw them out,
which was perhaps immoral...

547
00:59:32,307 --> 00:59:35,140
but I wanted to come to you clean,
so to speak.

548
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:38,304
Thought we'd go shopping
for a pair of jeans...

549
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:43,579
and 45 pairs of underwear,
and just throw one out each day.

550
00:59:43,652 --> 00:59:46,450
That's nice talk, Ben.
Keep drinking.

551
00:59:46,521 --> 00:59:52,118
Between the 101-proof breath
and the occasional drool...

552
00:59:52,193 --> 00:59:54,957
some interesting words
fall from your mouth.

553
01:00:22,991 --> 01:00:26,085
It looks like
I'm with the right girl.

554
01:00:28,997 --> 01:00:31,898
I'm very impressed
you would buy this for me.

555
01:00:36,805 --> 01:00:39,467
I'm gonna fill it right now.

556
01:00:41,042 --> 01:00:42,976
Do you want
to go gambling tonight?

557
01:00:43,044 --> 01:00:47,811
I was thinking we could go
and just play for a few hours.

558
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:51,780
I hadn't planned to gamble...

559
01:00:51,853 --> 01:00:54,117
but if you could keep
the bulk of my money...

560
01:00:54,189 --> 01:00:59,456
I could safely blow
a couple hundred bucks.

561
01:00:59,527 --> 01:01:02,018
Giving you money
makes me want to come.

562
01:01:07,902 --> 01:01:09,335
Then come.

563
01:01:51,379 --> 01:01:52,812
I'm sorry.

564
01:01:55,049 --> 01:01:56,914
I love you.

565
01:02:13,568 --> 01:02:17,334
- You got a 13.
- Hit me.

566
01:02:17,405 --> 01:02:21,102
- Wait. She's got a seven.
- I don't know. You tell me.

567
01:02:21,176 --> 01:02:25,636
- Hit.
- I'm busted. That's all right.

568
01:02:49,537 --> 01:02:53,098
You got it.
You can do it.

569
01:02:53,208 --> 01:02:56,644
Wait a minute!
Really? Oh, man!

570
01:02:56,711 --> 01:02:58,144
- What?
- He's okay.

571
01:02:58,213 --> 01:03:00,647
Do you want anything?

572
01:03:00,715 --> 01:03:05,778
Yeah, maybe a Bloody Mary.
Can you make that?

573
01:03:05,854 --> 01:03:07,617
What?

574
01:03:11,192 --> 01:03:13,956
Fuck you! Fuck!
You fucker!

575
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,068
That boy is...
You can't judge me!

576
01:03:23,171 --> 01:03:26,732
You! I am his father!

577
01:03:26,841 --> 01:03:28,274
Get up!

578
01:03:31,179 --> 01:03:32,942
Let's go, guys.

579
01:05:21,022 --> 01:05:23,115
How are you?

580
01:05:23,191 --> 01:05:24,624
Very well.

581
01:05:27,695 --> 01:05:30,960
I never expected
to have to ask this again...

582
01:05:31,032 --> 01:05:33,296
but how did our evening go?

583
01:05:36,904 --> 01:05:39,839
I remember getting
to the casino.

584
01:05:41,576 --> 01:05:46,673
And I remember kissing you.
That was really nice.

585
01:05:48,082 --> 01:05:50,175
And then playing blackjack...

586
01:05:50,251 --> 01:05:52,310
and then security came.

587
01:05:52,387 --> 01:05:57,017
But after that, everything's a blank.
What happened?

588
01:05:57,091 --> 01:06:00,322
They wanted to carry you out
and dump you onto the street...

589
01:06:00,395 --> 01:06:04,354
but I talked them
into letting me walk you out.

590
01:06:04,432 --> 01:06:07,765
That's impressive.

591
01:06:07,835 --> 01:06:09,769
How did you do that?

592
01:06:12,707 --> 01:06:15,141
I told them
that you were an alcoholic...

593
01:06:17,245 --> 01:06:19,304
and that I would take you home...

594
01:06:20,815 --> 01:06:24,216
and that we would never
go in there ever again.

595
01:06:29,323 --> 01:06:31,257
"We"?

596
01:06:43,104 --> 01:06:45,402
That's amazing.

597
01:06:45,506 --> 01:06:47,531
What are you?

598
01:06:47,642 --> 01:06:53,444
Some sort of angel visiting me
from one of my drunk fantasies?

599
01:06:55,783 --> 01:06:58,081
How can you be so good?

600
01:07:01,622 --> 01:07:04,090
I don't know
what you're saying.

601
01:07:08,429 --> 01:07:11,489
I'm just using you.

602
01:07:11,566 --> 01:07:13,932
I need you.

603
01:07:17,472 --> 01:07:21,431
Can we not talk about it anymore?
Not a word.

604
01:07:25,346 --> 01:07:26,813
You go back to sleep...

605
01:07:26,914 --> 01:07:30,975
and I'll go out
and get us some breakfast.

606
01:07:31,052 --> 01:07:34,544
- Will you be careful?
- Don't worry.

607
01:07:51,072 --> 01:07:53,666
Ben, I'm working tonight.

608
01:07:57,411 --> 01:07:59,003
I know.

609
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:19,666
I fuckin' talk all the time
because you never fuckin' listen to me!

610
01:08:19,734 --> 01:08:23,226
- So fuck you!
- Shut the fuck up.

611
01:08:25,973 --> 01:08:30,137
I'd like a beer
and a double Kamikaze, please.

612
01:08:31,846 --> 01:08:35,646
We mustn't kick the bar.
We lean into the bar.

613
01:08:35,716 --> 01:08:37,980
Just lean into the railing.

614
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:42,656
It's not vino veritaz.
It's en vino veritaz.

615
01:08:42,723 --> 01:08:44,782
Who the fuck are you talking to?

616
01:08:44,859 --> 01:08:49,626
Little brown-nosed gnomes
with a slingshot.

617
01:08:54,368 --> 01:08:59,135
- To be in drunk.
- Lean into the bar?

618
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:01,538
You lean into the bar.

619
01:09:03,077 --> 01:09:06,604
My boyfriend over there
is really boring the shit out of me...

620
01:09:06,681 --> 01:09:09,081
and I was wondering
if you would buy me a drink?

621
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:11,710
Do you mind
if I buy her a drink?

622
01:09:11,786 --> 01:09:16,985
- I don't care what you do with her.
- I'll have a rum and Coke, please.

623
01:09:17,058 --> 01:09:19,424
Barman, a rum and Coke.

624
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:26,625
Can I stay with you for awhile?

625
01:09:26,701 --> 01:09:30,603
You mean move in with me?
Isn't this a bit sudden?

626
01:09:30,705 --> 01:09:34,141
I don't have a lot of things.

627
01:09:34,208 --> 01:09:38,144
I don't think my wife
would dig it very much.

628
01:09:38,212 --> 01:09:43,878
Then maybe we should just go
to a motel and fuck all day.

629
01:09:43,951 --> 01:09:47,045
I could suck you like this.

630
01:09:47,121 --> 01:09:49,715
I'm sure fucking you
would be wonderful...

631
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:54,727
but it's almost impossible for me
to imagine being with someone else.

632
01:09:54,795 --> 01:09:58,629
Now listen, asshole,
I'm not just gonna sit here...

633
01:09:58,699 --> 01:10:00,963
and watch her suck on your ear!

634
01:10:01,035 --> 01:10:03,469
Shut the fuck up!

635
01:10:10,077 --> 01:10:12,011
I am sorry...

636
01:10:12,079 --> 01:10:15,879
but she and I have decided to spend
a few hours together...

637
01:10:16,017 --> 01:10:18,076
in a motel.

638
01:10:18,185 --> 01:10:20,551
And after that, caviar.

639
01:10:24,492 --> 01:10:26,255
Baby, wait up!

640
01:10:33,834 --> 01:10:36,769
You're quite a fighter.

641
01:10:36,837 --> 01:10:38,930
Here.

642
01:10:39,006 --> 01:10:43,102
Listen,
this may sound silly...

643
01:10:43,177 --> 01:10:45,111
but I have to ask you
to leave.

644
01:10:45,179 --> 01:10:48,512
It's what we do around here
when there's a fight.

645
01:10:48,582 --> 01:10:50,607
The men's room
is around the back.

646
01:10:58,526 --> 01:11:00,619
Sexy.

647
01:11:05,032 --> 01:11:06,465
I'm back.

648
01:11:09,704 --> 01:11:11,968
Oh, my God.

649
01:11:12,039 --> 01:11:14,599
- Did I scare you?
- What happened?

650
01:11:16,544 --> 01:11:19,138
Fuck, Ben.
Did you get in a fight?

651
01:11:20,548 --> 01:11:22,573
I thought you said
you didn't fight.

652
01:11:23,851 --> 01:11:26,251
How do you feel?

653
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:30,416
Like the kling-klang king
of the rim-ram room.

654
01:11:30,491 --> 01:11:32,425
Did you stop at a bar?

655
01:11:33,761 --> 01:11:36,252
Did you say something stupid
to somebody stupid?

656
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:38,264
Absolutely not.

657
01:11:39,834 --> 01:11:43,964
I was defending the honor
of some poor wayward maiden.

658
01:11:46,173 --> 01:11:48,107
I bet you were.

659
01:11:52,346 --> 01:11:56,305
Why don't you go take a shower
and put on your other shirt?

660
01:11:56,384 --> 01:12:00,115
Then we'll go shopping
and buy you some new clothes.

661
01:12:00,187 --> 01:12:02,621
I think this shirt is unlucky.

662
01:12:04,358 --> 01:12:06,121
Not at all.

663
01:12:07,194 --> 01:12:09,128
Your blood tastes good.

664
01:12:12,366 --> 01:12:14,425
We got eggs.

665
01:12:14,502 --> 01:12:18,131
I always had a fantasy
of being a flamenco dancer.

666
01:12:20,374 --> 01:12:21,898
I think you look great.

667
01:12:21,976 --> 01:12:23,910
We'll just get you a bow tie...

668
01:12:23,978 --> 01:12:27,072
and then you can be one
of those blackjack dealers.

669
01:12:27,148 --> 01:12:29,912
- All right?
- They wear it because they have to.

670
01:12:30,017 --> 01:12:32,713
I'll wear it
because I want to...

671
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:35,084
which will make me
look different.

672
01:12:39,126 --> 01:12:40,753
Let's get a drink!

673
01:12:42,329 --> 01:12:43,762
- What is that?
- What?

674
01:12:43,831 --> 01:12:48,461
Holy cow.
It came out of your ear!

675
01:12:50,204 --> 01:12:52,138
I didn't have time
to write you a card...

676
01:12:52,206 --> 01:12:54,606
with you breathing down
my neck all day...

677
01:12:54,675 --> 01:12:56,802
so you'll just have
to wing it, baby.

678
01:12:58,212 --> 01:12:59,645
Open it.

679
01:13:10,724 --> 01:13:13,784
They're your color.

680
01:13:13,861 --> 01:13:16,557
I think you should wear
one of them at a time.

681
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:19,963
One of these
and one of your other ones.

682
01:13:20,034 --> 01:13:23,401
I was gonna buy you just one...

683
01:13:23,471 --> 01:13:25,598
but I didn't think it would fly.

684
01:13:25,673 --> 01:13:28,267
Nurse!
As a gift, I mean.

685
01:13:34,315 --> 01:13:36,681
I'll wear them tonight.

686
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:39,877
One of them.

687
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,253
Tonight.

688
01:13:48,329 --> 01:13:50,092
Put it on.

689
01:13:56,637 --> 01:13:59,470
I can't get it.

690
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:01,474
I'll help you.

691
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:10,810
You'll be able to feel it,
sharp and hot under your ear...

692
01:14:10,918 --> 01:14:14,319
as one of the brothers
is putting your head facedown...

693
01:14:14,388 --> 01:14:17,824
into one
of the penthouse pillows.

694
01:14:54,862 --> 01:14:56,295
Wait!

695
01:15:00,935 --> 01:15:03,631
Maybe you should wait.

696
01:15:06,407 --> 01:15:10,104
- Why?
- You can tell.

697
01:15:10,177 --> 01:15:12,111
She really wants you to.

698
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,591
Maybe I should
follow you around...

699
01:15:34,668 --> 01:15:39,503
and ask one of your tricks
what it's like to sleep with you.

700
01:15:39,573 --> 01:15:41,507
They wouldn't know.

701
01:15:45,045 --> 01:15:47,309
Maybe you should ask me
sometime.

702
01:15:47,381 --> 01:15:49,645
Be happy to show you.

703
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:55,917
I'm gonna be home around 3:00.

704
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:59,357
If you're back, we could
watch some TV or something.

705
01:16:02,396 --> 01:16:06,662
What I'm saying is that I hope
you're back when I get home.

706
01:16:10,037 --> 01:16:12,198
Be careful.

707
01:16:14,074 --> 01:16:17,202
You be careful too.

708
01:16:17,277 --> 01:16:19,745
I'm gonna miss you.

709
01:16:26,954 --> 01:16:30,390
I know this really cool place
in the desert.

710
01:16:30,457 --> 01:16:32,391
We could go away
for a couple days.

711
01:16:36,196 --> 01:16:39,233
I'd like that.

712
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:56,816
I make comic faces and...

713
01:16:56,884 --> 01:17:00,411
stand on my head and grin at you
between my legs and...

714
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:04,815
I know loads of jokes.

715
01:17:08,095 --> 01:17:09,960
Wouldn't stand a chance,
would I?

716
01:17:18,739 --> 01:17:22,971
You did tell me
I ought to find myself a girl.

717
01:17:24,611 --> 01:17:26,806
I like it here with you.

718
01:17:29,683 --> 01:17:32,083
Let's stay for awhile.

719
01:18:10,057 --> 01:18:13,493
- Need a mix master.
- What?

720
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:17,826
Just sort of take everything
and blend it all together.

721
01:20:04,538 --> 01:20:06,472
Take this off.

722
01:20:49,516 --> 01:20:51,575
- Let's go inside.
- All right.

723
01:21:05,198 --> 01:21:07,291
I want my drinky.

724
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:17,973
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

725
01:21:24,618 --> 01:21:27,553
You're bleeding.
Wait. Hold it.

726
01:21:27,654 --> 01:21:32,091
- There's glass in here.
- I'm like a prickly pear!

727
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:36,424
- I'm a prickly pear!
- Go inside.

728
01:21:36,496 --> 01:21:41,263
- I wanna clean up the glass.
- Go inside. I'll take care of it.

729
01:21:41,335 --> 01:21:43,098
Are you sure?

730
01:21:44,171 --> 01:21:45,763
All right.

731
01:21:58,952 --> 01:22:02,410
- Everybody okay?
- We're fine.

732
01:22:02,522 --> 01:22:04,752
I'm so sorry.
We'll pay for the table...

733
01:22:04,858 --> 01:22:08,794
- and I'll clean this up.
- Don't worry.

734
01:22:10,364 --> 01:22:12,628
You seem prepared for accidents.

735
01:22:12,699 --> 01:22:14,860
We get a lot of screwups here.

736
01:22:16,269 --> 01:22:20,797
You two take your loud talk
and your liquor to your room.

737
01:22:20,874 --> 01:22:22,569
You check out
first thing tomorrow.

738
01:22:22,642 --> 01:22:25,236
I don't want to see
either of you here ever again.

739
01:22:25,312 --> 01:22:27,405
Don't you worry
about paying for anything.

740
01:22:27,481 --> 01:22:30,644
And don't you worry about cutting
your little hands on the glass.

741
01:22:30,717 --> 01:22:33,413
Let's just leave it at that.

742
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,250
See you in the morning.

743
01:24:04,010 --> 01:24:05,944
I'm in here, Ben.

744
01:24:13,286 --> 01:24:15,754
I bought some plain rice.

745
01:24:15,856 --> 01:24:19,348
You probably don't want
to hear it right now, but...

746
01:24:19,459 --> 01:24:21,723
I think it's something
that you could eat.

747
01:24:22,829 --> 01:24:25,389
If you get hungry,
will you let me know?

748
01:25:24,491 --> 01:25:27,085
I think I'm ready for rice.

749
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:45,474
I want you to see a doctor.

750
01:25:58,258 --> 01:26:01,159
I'm not gonna see a doctor.

751
01:26:05,732 --> 01:26:08,997
Maybe it's time
I moved to a hotel.

752
01:26:10,904 --> 01:26:12,667
And do what?

753
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:16,231
Rot away in a room?

754
01:26:21,248 --> 01:26:24,081
We're not gonna talk about that.

755
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:26,084
Fuck you.

756
01:26:28,488 --> 01:26:30,422
You're staying here.

757
01:26:32,425 --> 01:26:36,122
You're not going to any motel.

758
01:26:36,196 --> 01:26:39,632
It's just one thing
you can do for me.

759
01:26:41,434 --> 01:26:43,902
That's all I ask.

760
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:46,029
I've given you
gallons of free will.

761
01:26:46,106 --> 01:26:48,631
You can do this one thing for me!

762
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:02,113
I have to go to work now.

763
01:27:39,526 --> 01:27:42,461
Snake eyes!

764
01:27:46,366 --> 01:27:48,027
Five!

765
01:28:18,698 --> 01:28:20,290
Boxcars!

766
01:28:36,416 --> 01:28:37,440
Five!

767
01:28:39,018 --> 01:28:42,044
- Are you in for the convention?
- What?

768
01:29:24,831 --> 01:29:27,265
You're making me really hot.

769
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:30,960
Perhaps I could crash on the couch
for a few hours and then leave.

770
01:30:31,030 --> 01:30:32,588
Get out.

771
01:31:23,550 --> 01:31:27,042
I was wondering
how much it would cost?

772
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:29,088
Sorry, guys.
I don't know what you mean.

773
01:31:29,155 --> 01:31:32,591
- Anyway, I only date one guy at a time.
- Wait. We got money.

774
01:31:32,659 --> 01:31:35,093
Show her the fucking money.

775
01:31:35,161 --> 01:31:38,255
- How much are you willing to spend?
- How much do you want?

776
01:31:38,331 --> 01:31:40,765
Two hundred for an hour?

777
01:31:40,833 --> 01:31:43,461
- Don't your friends talk?
- Sure.

778
01:31:52,946 --> 01:31:55,414
- Get this on camera.
- Smile.

779
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:03,047
- How you doin'?
- I'm fine.

780
01:32:03,156 --> 01:32:06,353
- Do you want something to drink?
- I'm fine. Where's the money?

781
01:32:06,459 --> 01:32:07,892
Money.

782
01:32:10,697 --> 01:32:12,460
Twenty, forty, sixty,
eighty, a hundred.

783
01:32:12,532 --> 01:32:15,558
- Get it on camera, dude.
- Two hundred dollars.

784
01:32:18,605 --> 01:32:21,938
- All right, who's first?
- Hold on a second.

785
01:32:22,008 --> 01:32:24,943
Miser! You've gotta get him
on camera when he comes out.

786
01:32:25,011 --> 01:32:27,741
- Come on.
- Look, you two go downstairs.

787
01:32:27,814 --> 01:32:29,748
I'll be half an hour
and then...

788
01:32:29,816 --> 01:32:32,148
The only thing is,
we really wanna get him on tape.

789
01:32:32,218 --> 01:32:34,379
This is his first time.
Come on, Miser!

790
01:32:34,487 --> 01:32:36,955
We just wanna see him.

791
01:32:48,368 --> 01:32:53,101
- Ask her the question, man.
- Ask her. Come on, ask her.

792
01:32:54,574 --> 01:32:58,442
- I wanna fuck you up the butt.
- Nobody's doing any of that.

793
01:32:58,511 --> 01:33:01,776
You're all going straight,
one at a time, and then I'm outta here.

794
01:33:01,848 --> 01:33:03,281
- You hear me?
- Ask again.

795
01:33:03,349 --> 01:33:06,750
- How much to fuck you up the butt?
- He said it again!

796
01:33:06,819 --> 01:33:10,277
- I wanna fuck you up the butt.
- Fuck one of your friends in the butt.

797
01:33:11,491 --> 01:33:15,427
- I'm outta here.
- Wait. What did she say?

798
01:33:15,528 --> 01:33:17,621
- Get out of my fuckin' way.
- What did you say? Hold on.

799
01:33:17,697 --> 01:33:21,064
- Get the fuck out of my way!
- Don't fuckin' push me!

800
01:33:22,168 --> 01:33:24,966
What the fuck is your problem?

801
01:33:26,939 --> 01:33:30,375
Look, I'm really sorry, guys.
Let's just calm down.

802
01:33:30,443 --> 01:33:33,003
I'm sorry.
Just calm down.

803
01:33:36,616 --> 01:33:40,382
- Fuck, Miser.
- Shit.

804
01:33:42,522 --> 01:33:43,989
- Shit.
- Fuck.

805
01:34:33,239 --> 01:34:34,672
Where you headed?

806
01:34:34,741 --> 01:34:37,209
421 Vista.

807
01:34:39,746 --> 01:34:43,739
I couldn't help but notice
you had a little trouble sittin' down.

808
01:34:43,816 --> 01:34:46,876
You get a back door delivery
you weren't expectin'?

809
01:34:50,289 --> 01:34:53,554
You gonna be able
to pay for this?

810
01:34:53,626 --> 01:34:57,562
I asked you a question.
You got money?

811
01:34:58,798 --> 01:35:02,393
- I'll let you out here, sister.
- I have money.

812
01:35:02,468 --> 01:35:06,734
All right.
Don't take it out on me.

813
01:35:06,839 --> 01:35:09,603
I'm just covering my ass.

814
01:35:09,675 --> 01:35:12,269
Somethin' maybe you should have
thought about doing.

815
01:35:28,327 --> 01:35:30,420
Get her, Miser.

816
01:35:30,496 --> 01:35:31,929
Here, I got her.

817
01:35:37,937 --> 01:35:39,529
Fuckin' bite me.

818
01:36:02,829 --> 01:36:05,491
- Who is it?
- Mrs. Van Houten.

819
01:36:14,407 --> 01:36:18,503
I am sorry, but we have to ask you
to be out by the end of the week.

820
01:37:46,365 --> 01:37:49,266
I'm sorry, ma'am.
He hasn't checked back in.

821
01:38:11,223 --> 01:38:14,852
What is your problem?
You're on strike?

822
01:38:32,178 --> 01:38:33,611
Out.

823
01:38:35,014 --> 01:38:37,312
What's the problem?

824
01:38:37,383 --> 01:38:41,080
We don't want you in here.
That's the problem.

825
01:38:41,153 --> 01:38:43,087
Come on. Let's go.

826
01:38:43,155 --> 01:38:47,091
Let go of my arm.
If you want me outta here...

827
01:38:47,159 --> 01:38:50,595
- I don't wanna be outta here.
- You're going out.

828
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,094
Next time it won't be
so fuckin' easy.

829
01:39:30,302 --> 01:39:35,001
It ain't none of my business,
but what in the hell happened to you?

830
01:39:35,107 --> 01:39:39,771
I had an argument.

831
01:39:39,845 --> 01:39:42,075
Must have been
a hell of an argument.

832
01:39:42,148 --> 01:39:44,446
If I was you, I'd leave him.

833
01:39:44,517 --> 01:39:46,417
A pretty,
young lady like you...

834
01:39:47,686 --> 01:39:51,349
You can get any man you want.
Don't you know that?

835
01:40:25,458 --> 01:40:27,892
Where the fuck are you?

836
01:40:33,132 --> 01:40:35,566
Give me the address.

837
01:41:19,578 --> 01:41:21,671
It's so dark in here.

838
01:41:40,432 --> 01:41:43,265
You're so sick...

839
01:41:43,335 --> 01:41:45,030
so pale.

840
01:41:47,106 --> 01:41:49,040
My love.

841
01:41:50,276 --> 01:41:52,210
You're my love.

842
01:41:56,615 --> 01:41:59,015
Do you want help?

843
01:42:04,623 --> 01:42:07,558
Do you want my help?

844
01:42:11,630 --> 01:42:14,064
I want to see you.

845
01:42:17,136 --> 01:42:19,730
You're my angel.

846
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:23,174
I'm right here.

847
01:42:31,550 --> 01:42:33,484
What happened?

848
01:42:37,089 --> 01:42:41,526
Something went wrong,
but I'm okay.

849
01:42:45,097 --> 01:42:48,191
I'm sorry I put us asunder.

850
01:42:48,267 --> 01:42:49,700
It's okay.

851
01:43:29,408 --> 01:43:31,342
Let me do it.

852
01:43:36,582 --> 01:43:40,484
There. There you go.

853
01:43:49,428 --> 01:43:52,693
See how hard
you make me, angel?

854
01:44:31,403 --> 01:44:33,394
You know I love you.

855
01:44:40,245 --> 01:44:41,735
I know.

856
01:45:18,917 --> 01:45:20,851
I love you.

857
01:46:20,345 --> 01:46:23,712
I think the thing is...

858
01:46:23,782 --> 01:46:27,684
we both realized that
we didn't have that much time...

859
01:46:27,753 --> 01:46:30,688
and...

860
01:46:30,789 --> 01:46:35,852
I accepted him for who he was.

861
01:46:37,529 --> 01:46:40,692
I didn't expect him to change.

862
01:46:40,766 --> 01:46:45,430
I think he felt that for me too.

863
01:46:48,307 --> 01:46:50,434
I liked his drama.

864
01:46:53,645 --> 01:46:55,579
And he needed me.

865
01:46:59,051 --> 01:47:00,985
I loved him.
