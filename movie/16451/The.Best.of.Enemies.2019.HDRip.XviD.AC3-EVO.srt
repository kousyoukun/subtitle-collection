00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:37,158
<i>I think one of the most
emotional moments of my life</i>

3
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,195
<i>was the night that
I was initiated into the Klan.</i>

4
00:00:40,197 --> 00:00:42,765
<i>I was led into the Klavern
hall, which was dark.</i>

5
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:45,033
<i>The only light that I could
see was a fiery cross.</i>

6
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:47,038
<i>And that...
put me through the ceremony.</i>

7
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:49,205
<i>Purified me with water.</i>

8
00:00:49,207 --> 00:00:50,941
<i>Laid his hand
on my shoulder, says,</i>

9
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:52,575
<i>"You're part of
the Invisible Empire,</i>

10
00:00:52,577 --> 00:00:54,679
<i>United Klans of America."</i>

11
00:00:55,046 --> 00:00:58,180
<i>And there was a tremendous
applause throughout the auditorium.</i>

12
00:00:58,182 --> 00:01:00,884
<i>And I came up off the floor
really in tears.</i>

13
00:01:00,886 --> 00:01:03,352
<i>Because that's what I'd been
looking for all my life.</i>

14
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:06,990
<i>An opportunity to be heard,
an opportunity to be something.</i>

15
00:01:06,992 --> 00:01:09,359
<i>I first told him, "Hell no!"</i>

16
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:12,695
<i>I would never, ever.
But kill him, that's all I want.</i>

17
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,432
<i>That was on my heart
to kill him.</i>

18
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:17,633
<i>This is the kind of reputation
that I have in Durham.</i>

19
00:01:17,635 --> 00:01:20,069
<i>I'm not bragging about it,
but it is the truth.</i>

20
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:23,207
<i>You can call Durham,
and they will tell you.</i>

21
00:01:23,675 --> 00:01:28,144
<i>Uh, no, I will not take no for an answer.
I have to have the word "yes."</i>

22
00:01:28,146 --> 00:01:31,748
<i>Because all of our blood,
when it comes out, is the same color.</i>

23
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,052
<i>I haven't seen any blood different
yet than the color of mine.</i>

24
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:38,388
<i>And I'm sayin' whatever you believe in...
I keep sayin' it...</i>

25
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,427
<i>stand on it, baby, stand on it.</i>

26
00:02:05,216 --> 00:02:08,217
Equal housing now!
Equal housing now!

27
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:10,087
Equal housing now!

28
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:12,791
They call this Magic
City, Mr. Atkins.

29
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:15,327
Ain't no magic here.

30
00:02:16,228 --> 00:02:20,263
Abe Greenfeld ain't nothin'
but a vile slumlord.

31
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,732
You know it, and I know it.

32
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:24,234
And the black people
of East Durham

33
00:02:24,236 --> 00:02:26,505
have the same rights
as anybody else.

34
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:30,140
This girl, Mr. Atkins,

35
00:02:30,142 --> 00:02:35,414
this young lady is a single
mother of three children.

36
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:39,986
And she wake up this morning
to an eviction notice.

37
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,589
- But there's no hot water. What, baby, for two weeks?
- That's right, Miss A.

38
00:02:44,591 --> 00:02:47,625
- Two weeks, and you say, what? No toilet?
- No toilet.

39
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:51,031
No toilet. And that ain't
no way for no human to live.

40
00:02:59,204 --> 00:03:02,608
Mr. Atkins,
we done writin' letters here.

41
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:05,177
We want to be heard before
tomorrow night's ruling.

42
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:08,613
Miss Atwater,
you know our agenda is tight,

43
00:03:08,615 --> 00:03:12,684
and we simply cannot allot time
to everybody that wants to speak.

44
00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:16,087
Now thank you. Show yourselves out.

45
00:03:16,089 --> 00:03:19,657
Mr. Tucker, to what
do I owe this pleasure?

46
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:21,828
Sit down.

47
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:25,432
And a mighty fine afternoon
to you, too.

48
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:29,200
Now you listen to me, Councilman!
And you too, Mr. Tucker!

49
00:03:29,202 --> 00:03:32,503
We ain't goin' nowhere until
we get down to the brass tacks.

50
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:34,574
- You understand me?
- Everything all right here, Bill?

51
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:40,545
Mr. Oldham, now we have been
sitting here for over half an hour.

52
00:03:40,547 --> 00:03:42,749
- The councilman ain't done nothin' but...
- Ann.

53
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:47,087
Ann. We're gonna give you your
chance to speak tomorrow night.

54
00:03:49,222 --> 00:03:50,356
Are we good now?

55
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:53,860
Not yet.

56
00:03:55,996 --> 00:03:57,064
Come on.

57
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:12,010
Samuel Grace. Ayes?

58
00:04:12,012 --> 00:04:14,148
- Aye.
- Nays?

59
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:19,318
Okay, then. Fred Eggert,
Gene Waddle, and Samuel Grace

60
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,520
are tentatively approved
as new citizens

61
00:04:21,522 --> 00:04:23,655
of North Carolina Unit Nine
of the Invisible Empire,

62
00:04:23,657 --> 00:04:25,190
United Klans of America.

63
00:04:25,192 --> 00:04:27,725
Kligraph is directed
to certify the petitions

64
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:30,361
and prepare the oaths
for ceremony.

65
00:04:30,363 --> 00:04:31,765
Roy, next week should be fine.

66
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:35,834
Final item.
Combat and firearms training

67
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:37,805
resumes this Saturday
from noon to 4:00

68
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:41,776
under the supervision of
second officer Floyd Kelly.

69
00:04:42,442 --> 00:04:45,944
And I'll remind the Youth Corps members
that this training is mandatory.

70
00:04:45,946 --> 00:04:48,447
Y'all hear me?
I'm talkin' to you.

71
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:50,651
Yeah.

72
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:52,620
Let's bow our heads.

73
00:04:56,091 --> 00:04:58,891
Heavenly Father, give us strong
minds, great hearts,

74
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:00,828
true faith, and ready hands.

75
00:05:01,263 --> 00:05:03,897
Keep us unfettered
from the world

76
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:05,330
that we might fight
the good fight

77
00:05:05,332 --> 00:05:07,399
and be worthy
to claim the prize.

78
00:05:07,401 --> 00:05:11,872
May we as brethren and Klansmen
be steadfast and unremovable.

79
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:14,039
As we go hence
from this Klavern

80
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,376
into the struggle
of the alien world,

81
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:21,782
let us not forget the crowning
glory of a Klansman is to serve.

82
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,750
<i>Non silba, sed anthar.</i>

83
00:05:24,752 --> 00:05:27,621
Not for self, but for others!

84
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,888
- Get him ready.
- Mm-hmm.

85
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,857
- You can say that again.
- He was born ready.

86
00:05:31,859 --> 00:05:32,894
Ready or not.

87
00:05:33,962 --> 00:05:35,030
Mr. Ellis?

88
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:37,396
Oh, hey.

89
00:05:37,398 --> 00:05:39,933
This is, uh, this is the new
boy I was telling you about.

90
00:05:39,935 --> 00:05:42,068
Oh, sure. Sure, sure.

91
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,870
Sure, Ben.
Come on in the office.

92
00:05:43,872 --> 00:05:45,207
I'll see you fellas.

93
00:05:47,843 --> 00:05:49,110
Have a seat.

94
00:05:53,982 --> 00:05:55,515
What's your name, son?

95
00:05:55,517 --> 00:05:57,320
Leonard, sir.

96
00:05:59,222 --> 00:06:00,788
Don't be nervous, Leonard.

97
00:06:01,755 --> 00:06:04,259
Ben here tells me you'd like to
be a part of the Youth Corps.

98
00:06:05,126 --> 00:06:06,261
Yes. Yes, sir.

99
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:09,965
Why do you want to be in
the Youth Corps, Leonard?

100
00:06:10,665 --> 00:06:12,334
To help...

101
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:15,735
To help protect
the white race of America

102
00:06:15,737 --> 00:06:19,875
from the communist niggers
and Jews who threaten us, sir.

103
00:06:20,675 --> 00:06:22,345
That's a good boy.

104
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:25,812
But that's not all.

105
00:06:25,814 --> 00:06:28,349
It's <i>our</i> rights,
<i>our</i> freedoms,

106
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,385
<i>our</i> way of life
that need protecting.

107
00:06:31,153 --> 00:06:33,453
We're an endangered species,
Leonard.

108
00:06:33,455 --> 00:06:34,456
You understand?

109
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:36,092
I do.

110
00:06:38,094 --> 00:06:39,262
Let me show you something.

111
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:41,030
You see that?

112
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:44,298
One day, this will be
your most prized possession.

113
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,702
It will give you everything
you need in your life.

114
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:51,339
Brotherhood, standing in the
community, and a sense of pride

115
00:06:51,907 --> 00:06:54,209
that you're part of something
bigger than yourself.

116
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,382
But most importantly,
it will be a reminder every day

117
00:07:00,048 --> 00:07:02,717
that you will no longer be
an outsider.

118
00:07:08,324 --> 00:07:10,226
Welcome to the Youth Corps,
Leonard.

119
00:07:13,362 --> 00:07:14,964
We gonna
take care of that thing?

120
00:07:15,264 --> 00:07:16,365
Yeah.

121
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:19,302
Ben, bring the car around,
out back.

122
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,463
Now what?

123
00:07:53,936 --> 00:07:55,004
We wait.

124
00:08:47,357 --> 00:08:49,192
She got a nigger boyfriend.

125
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,862
The neighbors have
been complaining.

126
00:08:57,468 --> 00:08:58,503
Stay here.

127
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,695
Wait for the light, Wiley.

128
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:26,457
Hey. Thank you. Mm-hmm.

129
00:10:26,991 --> 00:10:28,259
Miss Dupree.

130
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:33,197
Miss Dupree... Yes, I know,
Miss Dupree, but...

131
00:10:34,765 --> 00:10:35,867
Hold on, Miss Dupree.

132
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:38,568
Miss Dupree says
she can't make it. Her kids...

133
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,837
Oh, no. Come here.

134
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:43,706
Cissy, you better get your ass
down to City Hall tonight.

135
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,477
No, no,
I don't want to hear that.

136
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,477
I have been a single mother
ever since I was 16,

137
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:50,513
and that's a whole hell
of a lot longer than you.

138
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:53,215
Well, child, it's supposed to be hard.

139
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:55,317
Are you gonna be there
later tonight or what?

140
00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:58,588
I better see your face
lookin' black and angry.

141
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,755
Mm-hmm.

142
00:10:59,757 --> 00:11:00,992
Who's next?

143
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,377
Hey, Jeb, I'll take this one.

144
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,379
Sure, Mr. Ellis.

145
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,282
- Finish up that tire for me, will you?
- All right.

146
00:11:35,726 --> 00:11:36,827
Can you
fill the place tonight?

147
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:39,663
You know I can, Carvie.
What's up?

148
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,533
We're ruling
on Greenfeld tonight.

149
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:44,534
Ann Atwater and all her
Operation Breakthrough niggers

150
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:46,937
are gonna make a scene.
I just need numbers.

151
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,875
Jesus. Greenfeld.
You gonna help that scum?

152
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:52,244
You know, C.P....

153
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:55,512
Reelection here.
He got deep pockets.

154
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,684
I need to
at least appear supportive.

155
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,920
And you need to keep your
friends on the city council.

156
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:06,890
I know, Carvie. We'll be there.

157
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:50,270
Oh, you late. Yeah.

158
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,904
I guess that's
what they call Africa time.

159
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,909
First item on the docket.

160
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,711
In the matter of the
Edgemont community housing,

161
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:02,413
the council will first hear
from Mr. Paulsen,

162
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,616
representing Mr. Greenfeld.

163
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:09,490
Good evening.

164
00:13:10,424 --> 00:13:13,591
As you know,
Mr. Greenfeld prides himself

165
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:16,960
on providing comfortable
housing at affordable rent

166
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,430
to a great many people
in Durham.

167
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,000
The council will hear
Mr. Paulsen.

168
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,970
As with any dwelling,
from time to time,

169
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:29,974
there undoubtedly will be some...
wear and tear.

170
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:34,111
Mr. Greenfeld fully intends to address any of these issues

171
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,516
that these folks might have.

172
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:39,351
However, with
the recent inclement weather,

173
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:43,255
Mr. Greenfeld has had insufficient
time to get to everyone.

174
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:44,824
That's a lie.

175
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,092
We ask that the council grant us

176
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:50,631
the 90-day extension
for these minor repairs.

177
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:52,333
Thank you.

178
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,034
Miss Atwater?

179
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:16,122
Uncomfortable housing
and unaffordable rent

180
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:21,259
are about the only two things
Abe Greenfeld has ever given us.

181
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,897
Now,
I have here with me

182
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:31,305
79 written complaints from
the residents of Edgemont.

183
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,973
Each and every last one of
them is a code violation.

184
00:14:38,513 --> 00:14:40,813
I brought 'em here with me
'cause, obviously,

185
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:43,385
you ain't get 'em the first couple
times when they were sent here.

186
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,087
Order!

187
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,990
Now we are fed up
with this man

188
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:55,562
and his eviction notices
and his rent hikes.

189
00:14:56,196 --> 00:15:00,200
He has absolutely no care for
his tenants' living conditions.

190
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:04,102
We humans. Humans shouldn't
have to live like this.

191
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,477
Thank you for your comments,
Miss Atwater.

192
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:13,912
And I will personally

193
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,148
pass those complaints
on to the housing commission

194
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,720
for future review.

195
00:15:19,354 --> 00:15:22,688
At this time,
the council will grant

196
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,726
the requested
90-day extension.

197
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,396
Thank you all. This council will
now stand in recess till next week.

198
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:32,600
Bye.

199
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,806
Put down that
paper, Claiborne.

200
00:15:38,773 --> 00:15:41,308
- Put it down.
- All right. Okay, Mama.

201
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,679
- Daddy.
- Huh?

202
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,980
Hey, it's time
to visit with your children.

203
00:15:47,582 --> 00:15:50,452
- Claiborne!
- I'm visiting. I-I...

204
00:15:51,152 --> 00:15:52,320
I'm visiting.

205
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:55,824
How's your marks, Tim?

206
00:15:57,258 --> 00:15:58,760
Tim, answer your father.

207
00:16:00,261 --> 00:16:01,963
I'm gettin' an "F" in math.

208
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,665
- That's 'cause you're stupid.
- Hey!

209
00:16:05,634 --> 00:16:07,668
Well, I know it ain't for
a lack of trying, son.

210
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,937
Maybe your teacher can give you
a little extra time after school.

211
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:11,574
I don't think this teacher.

212
00:16:13,943 --> 00:16:15,276
Why not?

213
00:16:15,811 --> 00:16:17,947
She said I just ain't got
a head for numbers, Daddy.

214
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,614
She said
that don't matter, though.

215
00:16:20,616 --> 00:16:23,117
Said I'll just work in the gas
station with you when I grow up.

216
00:16:28,623 --> 00:16:29,657
Yeah.

217
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,962
Maybe this teacher
ain't so smart.

218
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,130
I'm gonna stop in at Murdock this
morning before I go in. See your brother.

219
00:16:38,132 --> 00:16:40,333
- Give him a kiss for us, Daddy.
- You bet.

220
00:16:40,335 --> 00:16:41,871
I don't like that place.

221
00:16:42,136 --> 00:16:43,971
That's 'cause it's full of
weirdos and retards.

222
00:16:43,973 --> 00:16:45,306
Kenneth Wade!

223
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:47,641
Don't be
calling your brother that.

224
00:16:47,643 --> 00:16:49,409
I wasn't talking about him.

225
00:16:49,411 --> 00:16:51,614
- He just ain't as lucky as you is all.
- That's right.

226
00:16:52,414 --> 00:16:53,415
I'm sorry.

227
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:55,584
You be sorry
cleanin' that table.

228
00:16:56,318 --> 00:16:57,553
Yes, sir.

229
00:17:00,456 --> 00:17:02,258
I better go.
Give me some sugar, sugar.

230
00:17:02,558 --> 00:17:03,726
Bye, Daddy.

231
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:08,497
Let's go, girls.
Move your backsides.

232
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:13,334
Marilynn.

233
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:17,538
Marilynn!
Girl, you forgot your lunch.

234
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,042
You'd forget your head if it wasn't
attached to your shoulders. Go on now.

235
00:17:33,689 --> 00:17:36,325
Hey, come on.
Help me out here.

236
00:17:40,062 --> 00:17:41,096
Come on.

237
00:17:48,237 --> 00:17:50,272
No. You gotta
help me out here.

238
00:17:51,206 --> 00:17:52,242
Hey, buddy.

239
00:17:53,243 --> 00:17:54,277
Hey, buddy.

240
00:17:55,045 --> 00:17:56,112
It's Daddy.

241
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,882
How you doing, pumpkin?

242
00:17:59,381 --> 00:18:00,614
You have breakfast yet?

243
00:18:00,616 --> 00:18:02,217
Pancakes this morning.

244
00:18:02,518 --> 00:18:04,955
Oh! Hey, buddy,
that's your favorite.

245
00:18:07,824 --> 00:18:08,925
Thank you.

246
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:16,265
You got eggs
and maple syrup.

247
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:25,375
Supposed to cut this up
ahead of time.

248
00:18:26,576 --> 00:18:28,411
He can't swallow all this.

249
00:18:30,547 --> 00:18:31,748
There you go.

250
00:18:32,382 --> 00:18:33,750
There you go.

251
00:18:37,721 --> 00:18:41,957
So you must multiply
the three on this side by two.

252
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:45,259
But remember,
whatever you do to the bottom,

253
00:18:45,261 --> 00:18:46,963
you must do to the top,
right?

254
00:18:48,297 --> 00:18:49,964
Good.
So, I want you to go ahead,

255
00:18:49,966 --> 00:18:52,002
work out the equations
that I gave you.

256
00:18:53,903 --> 00:18:56,136
Let's do the next one,
let's see what you come up with.

257
00:18:56,138 --> 00:18:57,607
All right?

258
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:12,255
Don't...

259
00:19:31,776 --> 00:19:32,843
Over here. Come on.

260
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,648
Ann Atwater.

261
00:19:41,418 --> 00:19:42,452
Hey, baby.

262
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:46,090
- Mama!
- Oh!

263
00:19:46,556 --> 00:19:48,057
Thank God.

264
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,159
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

265
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:52,663
Okay, baby. You go wait in the car.
I'll be right there.

266
00:19:53,831 --> 00:19:56,865
- Is anybody hurt?
- Everyone's okay. Just lots of smoke.

267
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:58,300
How did it start?

268
00:19:58,302 --> 00:19:59,702
Most likely electrical,

269
00:19:59,704 --> 00:20:01,203
the way they keep
this place up.

270
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:03,539
Or it could've been set
on purpose.

271
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,910
No. Klan ain't that stupid.

272
00:20:06,377 --> 00:20:07,445
Why do you say that?

273
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:10,414
When a black school burns,
then...

274
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,584
Then what?

275
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:18,690
Then the black kids
gotta find a new school.

276
00:20:27,998 --> 00:20:30,399
Turns out,
he left the thing in neutral.

277
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:32,568
It rolls
right back into the ravine.

278
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,737
They didn't find that truck
for two weeks.

279
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:38,240
Oh, are you talking about how
small your pecker is again, Wiley?

280
00:20:38,242 --> 00:20:40,844
That ain't funny, Doreen.

281
00:20:40,846 --> 00:20:43,949
Yeah, it ain't that kind of funny.
That's for sure.

282
00:21:06,304 --> 00:21:08,141
You-You wait...

283
00:21:12,244 --> 00:21:13,879
The guy's got one arm.

284
00:21:14,846 --> 00:21:15,847
C.P.

285
00:21:16,882 --> 00:21:20,685
Garland... Garland Keith, my friend.
You're out late.

286
00:21:21,485 --> 00:21:24,220
- You wanna have a seat?
- No, thank you. Gentlemen.

287
00:21:24,222 --> 00:21:27,390
Well, something must be awfully
important for you to lower yourself

288
00:21:27,392 --> 00:21:29,592
- to come to a dump like this, Garland.
- Floyd, come on now.

289
00:21:29,594 --> 00:21:30,796
No, no. Mm-mmm.

290
00:21:31,463 --> 00:21:33,797
I like
the White Citizens' Council,

291
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:37,234
with their parade floats and
their fancy country club meetings.

292
00:21:37,236 --> 00:21:41,071
I'm always honored to mop up after
'em, do the dirty work.

293
00:21:41,073 --> 00:21:43,306
You'll have to excuse Mr. Kelly.
It's been a long week.

294
00:21:43,308 --> 00:21:46,243
Sorry to say it's
about to get a bit longer.

295
00:21:46,245 --> 00:21:49,612
There was a fire out at
East End Elementary today.

296
00:21:49,614 --> 00:21:51,349
So what? It's a black school.

297
00:21:52,517 --> 00:21:56,352
The parents have already filed
a petition to allow the students

298
00:21:56,354 --> 00:21:59,558
to finish out the year
at Durham Elementary School.

299
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:03,028
There's an emergency
council meeting tomorrow.

300
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:08,400
Well... Ann Atwater?

301
00:22:09,268 --> 00:22:10,468
I think so.

302
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,770
This ain't no small
landlord dispute, Garland.

303
00:22:13,772 --> 00:22:15,540
We gonna need everybody
on this one.

304
00:22:16,675 --> 00:22:18,476
Well, that's why
I'm here, C.P.

305
00:22:25,852 --> 00:22:27,153
Were you scared?

306
00:22:29,422 --> 00:22:30,456
A little.

307
00:22:34,694 --> 00:22:36,395
It's gonna be
all right, okay?

308
00:22:37,797 --> 00:22:39,699
All right, baby?
You get some rest.

309
00:22:40,499 --> 00:22:42,202
Try to go to sleep, okay?

310
00:22:46,173 --> 00:22:47,372
You warm enough?

311
00:22:47,807 --> 00:22:49,173
Mm-hmm.

312
00:22:52,011 --> 00:22:53,279
- Mama?
- Mm-hmm?

313
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:56,916
Where are we gonna
go to school now?

314
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,052
Don't you worry
about a thing, okay?

315
00:23:01,454 --> 00:23:04,190
Mama gonna find you
somewhere real nice to go.

316
00:23:06,326 --> 00:23:07,593
Say your prayers.

317
00:23:10,763 --> 00:23:12,730
<i>The fire was strictly limited</i>

318
00:23:12,732 --> 00:23:15,499
<i>to the building's facilities
and perhaps equipment.</i>

319
00:23:15,501 --> 00:23:18,303
<i>I know your first appearance
here, you can't make an opinion...</i>

320
00:23:18,305 --> 00:23:20,704
I'm not gonna have them kids
going to Tim's school.

321
00:23:20,706 --> 00:23:21,742
Mmm.

322
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:24,843
Well, they gonna
put 'em somewhere.

323
00:23:24,845 --> 00:23:26,914
Ain't gonna be
in Durham Elementary.

324
00:23:27,413 --> 00:23:30,083
Tim having enough trouble
without more distractions.

325
00:23:32,052 --> 00:23:35,121
May have to look into one of them
private schools outside of town.

326
00:23:35,755 --> 00:23:39,723
- Oh, yeah. How we gonna pay for that?
- I'm workin' on it.

327
00:23:39,725 --> 00:23:42,995
It ain't gonna work until you start
sellin' gas to the other half of Durham.

328
00:23:48,335 --> 00:23:49,535
What's that
supposed to mean?

329
00:23:50,203 --> 00:23:51,470
You know what it means.

330
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:54,039
- That's not fair.
- Oh, fair.

331
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,942
- Hey.
- Come on. It's not fair, it's a fact.

332
00:23:56,944 --> 00:23:58,543
It's not fair
'cause you know I can't.

333
00:23:58,545 --> 00:24:00,312
How's it gonna look
if the president of the Klan

334
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:02,213
is puttin' gasoline
in a nigger's car?

335
00:24:02,215 --> 00:24:04,115
- How's it gonna look to my Klan folk?
- Oh. Oh, I see.

336
00:24:04,117 --> 00:24:07,585
I... I didn't know
that the Klan pays your bills.

337
00:24:07,587 --> 00:24:10,055
- I didn't think so.
- Here we go.

338
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:12,091
You spend all that time
at Klavern hall

339
00:24:12,093 --> 00:24:15,627
jaw-jackin' about them niggers
and them commies and them Jews.

340
00:24:15,629 --> 00:24:17,898
- I don't sound like that.
- Yeah, you do.

341
00:24:20,969 --> 00:24:22,401
- Give me some...
- Eww!

342
00:24:22,403 --> 00:24:23,904
Claiborne Ellis,
you smell like beer.

343
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:47,028
I'm not gonna have them kids
going to our school.

344
00:24:48,628 --> 00:24:52,131
This emergency council meeting
was called late last night

345
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:54,599
after an apparent
electrical fire

346
00:24:54,601 --> 00:24:58,304
destroyed nearly half
of East End Elementary School.

347
00:24:58,306 --> 00:25:01,207
They've been in session
for nearly three hours now.

348
00:25:35,176 --> 00:25:38,345
This council is facing
some difficult decisions.

349
00:25:38,347 --> 00:25:43,183
Tonight, we've had to consider how
these decisions will affect the students

350
00:25:43,185 --> 00:25:45,521
of not one school, but two.

351
00:25:46,422 --> 00:25:48,921
We've heard testimony
from the marshal

352
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,690
that eight classrooms
and three common areas,

353
00:25:51,692 --> 00:25:52,993
including the gymnasium,

354
00:25:52,995 --> 00:25:54,627
were unaffected by the fire.

355
00:25:54,629 --> 00:25:56,329
- Unaffected?
- Hey.

356
00:25:56,331 --> 00:25:58,531
- Have you been to the school?
- She's breakin' the rules.

357
00:25:58,533 --> 00:26:00,933
No, no. Ain't nobody talkin' to
you, C.P., so shut your mouth.

358
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:03,335
- Miss Atwater, you've had your time.
- I've seen the school.

359
00:26:03,337 --> 00:26:05,671
And if that marshal says that
school is habitable for children...

360
00:26:05,673 --> 00:26:07,373
Miss Atwater,
you have had your time.

361
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:09,842
...then he's just lyin'
or he just plain stupid!

362
00:26:09,844 --> 00:26:12,312
- Why don't you shut up?
- Don't make no sense.

363
00:26:19,354 --> 00:26:20,389
Shut up!

364
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:22,558
We will have quiet
in the chamber!

365
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:26,927
Now what we talkin' about is important,

366
00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:29,731
and you're gonna damn well
listen to us, Mr. Steele.

367
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:31,433
Miss Atwater.

368
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:33,135
Miss Atwater.

369
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:37,272
Kindly take your seat before
I have a deputy remove you.

370
00:26:52,121 --> 00:26:53,155
Now then...

371
00:26:54,456 --> 00:26:56,123
it is the opinion
of this council

372
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:58,927
that there remain
two basic questions.

373
00:26:59,727 --> 00:27:05,165
One, is East End
a safe and habitable place

374
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:07,703
for its students to finish
their school year?

375
00:27:08,471 --> 00:27:12,373
And two, would the students
of Durham Elementary

376
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:17,447
be unfairly burdened by the sudden
and massive influx of new students?

377
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:23,353
Our answer
to both of these questions...

378
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,987
is yes.

379
00:27:30,226 --> 00:27:33,327
With the limited number of
classrooms that remain at East End,

380
00:27:33,329 --> 00:27:36,963
the students will be put
on a split-shift system.

381
00:27:36,965 --> 00:27:41,437
One from 7:00 a.m. to noon,
the other from noon to 5:00.

382
00:27:41,837 --> 00:27:43,504
We're good. I got it.

383
00:27:43,506 --> 00:27:44,641
Miss Atwater?

384
00:27:47,443 --> 00:27:48,942
Who the hell are you?

385
00:27:48,944 --> 00:27:51,214
Miss Atwater,
we're from the NAACP.

386
00:27:55,618 --> 00:27:58,019
<i>WDNC news time, 9:00 a.m.</i>

387
00:27:58,021 --> 00:28:02,323
<i>Recapping our top story, the NAACP's
legal action is causing quite a stir</i>

388
00:28:02,325 --> 00:28:04,025
<i>inside the county's
district court,</i>

389
00:28:04,027 --> 00:28:06,127
<i>one source saying
he would not want to be</i>

390
00:28:06,129 --> 00:28:08,362
<i>in Judge Les Hallford's shoes
this morning.</i>

391
00:28:08,364 --> 00:28:10,733
Good morning, Your Honor.

392
00:28:14,938 --> 00:28:17,972
- Is that it?
- Just arrived.

393
00:28:17,974 --> 00:28:21,643
Full and immediate integration
of all Durham public schools.

394
00:28:24,414 --> 00:28:26,380
Get Wilbur Hobby in here.

395
00:28:26,382 --> 00:28:27,483
Yes, sir.

396
00:28:29,785 --> 00:28:31,852
You've passed things down
before.

397
00:28:31,854 --> 00:28:33,690
Ah, you know
I can't do that.

398
00:28:34,257 --> 00:28:38,361
These idiots just sent kids back
into a school that's still smokin'.

399
00:28:38,728 --> 00:28:41,929
I pass it down, it's the same
as ruling against.

400
00:28:41,931 --> 00:28:44,901
I know. I just wanted to
make sure you knew that.

401
00:28:45,969 --> 00:28:50,071
I asked you here for your
counsel, Wilbur, not a lecture.

402
00:28:50,073 --> 00:28:51,406
Sorry.

403
00:28:54,245 --> 00:28:57,179
What if you held off,
delayed your ruling?

404
00:28:57,181 --> 00:29:00,983
Delaying the inevitable,
that's all that would be.

405
00:29:00,985 --> 00:29:05,787
No. You delay to allow the people of
Durham to reach their own decision.

406
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:07,623
I'm not following, Wilbur.

407
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,394
- I know a guy.
- You know a guy?

408
00:29:13,396 --> 00:29:15,162
Yes, I know a guy.

409
00:29:15,164 --> 00:29:18,600
He runs a department at
Shaw University down in Raleigh.

410
00:29:18,602 --> 00:29:21,902
He does this thing.
Uh, he holds charrettes.

411
00:29:21,904 --> 00:29:23,240
Cha-what?

412
00:29:23,906 --> 00:29:27,576
They're kind of, uh,
these official community summits

413
00:29:27,578 --> 00:29:29,745
with people from both sides
of the problem.

414
00:29:29,747 --> 00:29:33,284
They're called charrettes.
He's had some pretty good results.

415
00:29:36,453 --> 00:29:39,658
Wilbur, get this guy of yours
up here.

416
00:29:57,742 --> 00:30:00,110
Bill?
Wilbur Hobby's on the phone.

417
00:30:09,754 --> 00:30:10,988
Wilbur Hobby.

418
00:30:11,355 --> 00:30:13,488
<i>Why does
this phone call worry me?</i>

419
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:15,357
Well, what a coincidence.

420
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:17,159
I was hoping
it would worry you.

421
00:30:19,096 --> 00:30:20,596
How are you, Wilbur?

422
00:30:20,598 --> 00:30:22,598
Looks like you're havin'
some trouble up there.

423
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,638
Well, nothing a heavy dose
of Bill Riddick can't solve.

424
00:30:28,972 --> 00:30:30,007
<i>Hello?</i>

425
00:30:31,743 --> 00:30:34,777
Look, Bill, I, uh...
I heard York went well.

426
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:37,680
York, Pennsylvania, isn't
Durham, North Carolina, Wilbur.

427
00:30:37,682 --> 00:30:41,353
Well, all the more reason
we need you.

428
00:30:42,454 --> 00:30:44,456
<i>Look, you're the only one
that does this.</i>

429
00:30:45,223 --> 00:30:47,089
<i>Besides,
it'll get you outta the house.</i>

430
00:30:47,091 --> 00:30:48,825
<i>Delores even said
you're driving her crazy.</i>

431
00:30:50,495 --> 00:30:52,330
<i>We've been
drivin' each other crazy.</i>

432
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:57,166
All right, Wilbur.

433
00:30:57,168 --> 00:30:58,737
- <i>All right.</i>
- Great.

434
00:30:59,304 --> 00:31:02,173
- I'll see you in a few hours, Bill.
- <i>A... A few hours?</i>

435
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,409
Hello?

436
00:31:07,212 --> 00:31:09,312
<i>Now,
I've asked Bill Riddick here</i>

437
00:31:09,314 --> 00:31:11,684
<i>to conduct
a ten-day community charrette</i>

438
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:15,885
<i>so that the citizens of Durham
can finally come to a resolution</i>

439
00:31:15,887 --> 00:31:18,020
<i>on the school integration
question.</i>

440
00:31:18,022 --> 00:31:20,990
The city council
will abide this resolution

441
00:31:20,992 --> 00:31:23,025
and enact
the will of the people.

442
00:31:23,027 --> 00:31:25,163
That gutless fool.

443
00:31:25,664 --> 00:31:26,699
Abide?

444
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,566
Abide? It's not even defined.

445
00:31:29,568 --> 00:31:31,737
He's making us
define it.

446
00:31:32,671 --> 00:31:34,572
What are we gonna say
to the press?

447
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,708
Nothing.

448
00:31:37,242 --> 00:31:39,377
At least not till
we get a legal opinion.

449
00:31:40,245 --> 00:31:44,115
And in the meantime,
what in good Christ is a charrette?

450
00:32:12,945 --> 00:32:15,414
Uh, yeah, we don't sell
gasoline to niggers here.

451
00:32:19,452 --> 00:32:22,555
I'm not looking for a fill-up.
Mr. Ellis?

452
00:32:25,123 --> 00:32:26,425
My name is Bill Riddick.

453
00:32:28,794 --> 00:32:29,795
Yeah?

454
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:33,831
Uh...
Wilbur Hobby suggested I...

455
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:37,269
- Wilbur Hobby sent you here?
- Yeah. He said I should come see you, yeah.

456
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:40,139
He said you represent a great
many people in this town.

457
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:44,610
He'd be right about that.

458
00:32:44,977 --> 00:32:48,746
Well, Mr. Ellis,
I've been asked to organize a charrette.

459
00:32:48,748 --> 00:32:50,314
I read the newspaper.

460
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:52,519
- Oh. So then you know...
- Hold on.

461
00:32:53,487 --> 00:32:58,323
Are you here to ask me to come to
your, uh, integration meetings?

462
00:32:58,325 --> 00:33:02,295
Well, for now, just lunch.

463
00:33:03,028 --> 00:33:05,296
- Lunch?
- Tomorrow.

464
00:33:05,298 --> 00:33:07,200
With, uh...
with me and with Ann Atwater.

465
00:33:09,135 --> 00:33:10,302
Come again?

466
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:13,003
Well, I was hoping you'd come to
lunch with me and Ann Atwater.

467
00:33:13,005 --> 00:33:15,007
- Ann Atwater?
- Ann Atwater.

468
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,346
What did Wilbur Hobby think
I'd say to that?

469
00:33:22,348 --> 00:33:24,582
Well, he thought
you would say no.

470
00:33:24,584 --> 00:33:27,317
- He'd be right about that, too.
- Well, see here, Mr. Ellis...

471
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:31,356
- You're not from around here, Mr....
- Riddick.

472
00:33:31,358 --> 00:33:32,957
...so I'll help you out.

473
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:35,193
Folks in this town,
and especially me,

474
00:33:35,195 --> 00:33:37,197
want niggers to stay
in their own schools.

475
00:33:39,132 --> 00:33:41,368
That's definitely one of the
options, Mr. Ellis.

476
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:46,007
But right now,
I'm gonna leave you my card.

477
00:33:49,175 --> 00:33:50,711
The local number is
on the back.

478
00:33:51,244 --> 00:33:54,147
- You change your mind...
- Boy, you better get on outta here.

479
00:33:55,716 --> 00:33:57,150
Go on, git.
Like I told you.

480
00:34:03,055 --> 00:34:05,759
Mr. Ellis,
I hope you reconsider.

481
00:34:06,693 --> 00:34:10,664
This charrette is happening. So, uh,
if you truly represent your people...

482
00:34:11,831 --> 00:34:12,900
represent them.

483
00:34:16,136 --> 00:34:17,304
Have a good day.

484
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,934
We know this makes
you uncomfortable, C.P.

485
00:34:48,936 --> 00:34:51,269
But goddamn it, it's the best
thing that could have happened.

486
00:34:51,271 --> 00:34:54,205
"Uncomfortable" isn't exactly
the word I'd use for it, Carvie.

487
00:34:54,207 --> 00:34:56,207
C.P., what do you think
would happen

488
00:34:56,209 --> 00:34:58,577
if a lily-white liberal was
in there instead of you?

489
00:34:58,579 --> 00:34:59,947
Nothing good.

490
00:35:00,915 --> 00:35:03,449
A liberal and Ann Atwater
would pass integration

491
00:35:03,451 --> 00:35:05,751
faster than a hot knife
through butter.

492
00:35:05,753 --> 00:35:08,420
- That's what don't make no sense.
- What don't?

493
00:35:08,422 --> 00:35:10,723
This Riddick nigger wants
school integration, right?

494
00:35:10,725 --> 00:35:13,026
So why me?
Why put that on himself?

495
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,895
I shoulda been
the last person on his list.

496
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:19,634
C.P., this judge...

497
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:21,937
Our hands may be tied.

498
00:35:22,771 --> 00:35:25,237
But it won't matter if we
have a friend on the inside.

499
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:28,775
And especially if that friend
is C.P. Ellis.

500
00:35:28,777 --> 00:35:30,777
Oh, Charlie, I...

501
00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:33,948
He's about to hand you
the keys to school integration,

502
00:35:34,915 --> 00:35:36,651
and you're going to
lock the door.

503
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:51,066
- Hey! How you doin'? How your dad doin'?
- Good.

504
00:35:53,935 --> 00:35:55,236
How late is he?

505
00:35:56,104 --> 00:35:57,204
Twenty minutes.

506
00:35:58,006 --> 00:36:01,643
C.P. comin' to have lunch
with two niggers.

507
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,680
He'd just as soon shoot us
than do that.

508
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,313
Y'all northern folks
just don't get it.

509
00:36:07,315 --> 00:36:08,915
I'm from North Carolina,
Ann.

510
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,817
Oh, yeah? Where about?

511
00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:13,455
- Hertford County.
- That still north of here.

512
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:18,493
He's here.

513
00:36:34,409 --> 00:36:35,544
Here he go.

514
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,930
Would you look at
that crazy white man?

515
00:36:54,596 --> 00:36:56,631
Just pacing back and forth.

516
00:36:58,266 --> 00:37:00,169
I ain't waitin' for that cracker.
I'm hungry.

517
00:37:01,037 --> 00:37:03,573
Mr. Ellis?
Please, come sit down.

518
00:37:16,251 --> 00:37:17,884
Well, uh, okay.

519
00:37:17,886 --> 00:37:20,154
Um, thank you both
for coming.

520
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:22,555
Hopefully,
this is a first step...

521
00:37:22,557 --> 00:37:25,893
Hey, I'm not gonna sit here one
minute longer than I have to, so...

522
00:37:25,895 --> 00:37:30,965
Well, go on and git, then. That way, me
and Bill can have a civilized conversation.

523
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:33,266
Mr. Ellis, um,

524
00:37:33,268 --> 00:37:36,806
I'm holding a steering committee
meeting here on Saturday.

525
00:37:37,206 --> 00:37:41,108
And I've invited people who represent
all types of citizens in this community.

526
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,245
All types?
Only two types in this town.

527
00:37:43,247 --> 00:37:46,580
Well, whites, black,
liberals, conservatives.

528
00:37:46,582 --> 00:37:48,449
For a charrette
to be successful,

529
00:37:48,451 --> 00:37:51,253
we need to bring together a
large number of diverse people.

530
00:37:51,255 --> 00:37:53,621
The only folk he gonna bring,

531
00:37:53,623 --> 00:37:55,389
they gonna be wearing
sheets and hoods.

532
00:37:55,391 --> 00:37:56,659
Ain't that right, C.P.?

533
00:37:58,393 --> 00:37:59,427
Hold on.

534
00:38:00,462 --> 00:38:01,829
If you already have
a meeting set,

535
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:03,298
what the hell am I doing
sitting here?

536
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:05,968
Well, you're here,
both of you...

537
00:38:06,936 --> 00:38:10,773
because I need two co-chairs
to lead the charrette.

538
00:38:19,982 --> 00:38:22,817
I'm gonna think about it,
you know,

539
00:38:22,819 --> 00:38:27,124
'cause I wouldn't want your type takin'
over this, uh... what'd you call it?

540
00:38:29,193 --> 00:38:31,195
Charade?

541
00:38:34,932 --> 00:38:36,834
I don't know
what you're up to either.

542
00:38:38,268 --> 00:38:42,270
I don't like it.
You could use me for my help. That's fine.

543
00:38:42,272 --> 00:38:44,940
But I am not gonna work
with that cracker.

544
00:38:44,942 --> 00:38:46,676
So you need to look
somewhere else.

545
00:38:48,511 --> 00:38:49,779
This corn bread is good.

546
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,784
I would love it.

547
00:38:59,555 --> 00:39:01,289
Let me help you clear this.

548
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:03,892
- It was delicious.
- Very nice of you. Thank you.

549
00:39:03,894 --> 00:39:05,694
You outdid yourself,
Mrs. Keith.

550
00:39:05,696 --> 00:39:07,729
Oh, well, thank you.

551
00:39:07,731 --> 00:39:10,565
Ten days is a long time
with them people, Garland.

552
00:39:10,567 --> 00:39:14,469
It's also a long time for them to
be making decisions on integration

553
00:39:14,471 --> 00:39:16,371
without us having a voice.

554
00:39:16,373 --> 00:39:18,976
That's not gonna make it
any easier to sell to my people.

555
00:39:19,877 --> 00:39:22,046
Well, you're their
president, C.P.

556
00:39:23,114 --> 00:39:24,581
You just make 'em understand.

557
00:39:26,351 --> 00:39:29,986
Hell, it says so right there
in your Klan Creed:

558
00:39:29,988 --> 00:39:35,058
"Failure to know your enemy gives
them aid and comfort" and all that.

559
00:39:36,727 --> 00:39:41,265
I mean, the truth is, C.P., we...
we don't know the enemy at all.

560
00:39:42,332 --> 00:39:43,400
Do we?

561
00:40:00,184 --> 00:40:02,450
You're yankin' on the trigger
too hard.

562
00:40:02,452 --> 00:40:05,621
Trick is to think of it as pressin'
the trigger, not pullin' on it.

563
00:40:05,623 --> 00:40:06,758
Ten-hut!

564
00:40:07,025 --> 00:40:08,524
Y'all heed this man, now.

565
00:40:08,526 --> 00:40:10,161
Mr. Kelly here's an expert.

566
00:40:10,628 --> 00:40:13,129
He even knows that word for when
you breathe out 'fore you shoot.

567
00:40:13,131 --> 00:40:14,332
What's that called again?

568
00:40:14,866 --> 00:40:17,099
Respiratory pause.

569
00:40:17,101 --> 00:40:19,369
See? What'd I tell ya?

570
00:40:19,371 --> 00:40:22,405
- All right, one more, then next up.
- All right.

571
00:40:22,407 --> 00:40:25,143
You didn't care too much for
that conversation last night.

572
00:40:25,943 --> 00:40:28,779
Well, when it's me and you,
it's fine.

573
00:40:29,746 --> 00:40:31,849
I ain't much for talking
in mixed company.

574
00:40:32,582 --> 00:40:34,317
Well, we do need
people there, Floyd.

575
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:37,355
And Carvie asked me
personally, so...

576
00:40:38,122 --> 00:40:41,025
Yeah, I know it, C.P.
And I'll back you up on it.

577
00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:45,928
- But, uh... be careful.
- Careful of what?

578
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,665
If you wrestle with a pig...

579
00:40:48,967 --> 00:40:50,235
...you gonna get muddy.

580
00:40:51,903 --> 00:40:54,804
Meeting these benchmarks
successfully will depend entirely

581
00:40:54,806 --> 00:40:58,942
on the dedication and enthusiasm
of this steering committee.

582
00:40:58,944 --> 00:41:01,945
And, uh, we haven't got
much time to get organized,

583
00:41:01,947 --> 00:41:05,017
so priority one
will be to get the word out

584
00:41:05,516 --> 00:41:10,888
and to recruit as many citizens as
possible to come and participate.

585
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:15,560
All right,
before we go any further,

586
00:41:15,927 --> 00:41:17,962
we need to elect
our two co-chairs.

587
00:41:20,098 --> 00:41:23,168
I nominate Ann Atwater...

588
00:41:25,837 --> 00:41:27,505
and C.P. Ellis.

589
00:41:32,978 --> 00:41:35,012
But he's a Klansman.

590
00:41:35,014 --> 00:41:37,082
And we're talking
about integration.

591
00:41:37,515 --> 00:41:41,551
Uh, Mr. Riddick, I already done
told you I won't work with that man.

592
00:41:41,553 --> 00:41:43,487
That'd be just fine with me.

593
00:41:43,489 --> 00:41:45,956
Everybody know it would be
just fine with you, C.P.

594
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:47,724
Just hold on a minute now,
Ann.

595
00:41:47,726 --> 00:41:50,029
I'd like to hear from C.P.
on this. Mr. Ellis.

596
00:41:52,265 --> 00:41:55,532
Well, I'm not in the habit of interviewing
for a job that I don't really want.

597
00:41:55,534 --> 00:41:57,767
But you're asking,
so I'll tell you.

598
00:41:57,769 --> 00:42:00,937
Everybody talkin' about nigras want
this, nigras need that.

599
00:42:00,939 --> 00:42:03,574
This whole thing started 'cause
of what nigras are demanding.

600
00:42:05,377 --> 00:42:09,046
What about white folks?
What about what we want?

601
00:42:09,048 --> 00:42:11,748
- You already got everything you want.
- No, we don't.

602
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:15,054
Now the niggers in this town are trying
to take away everything we got left.

603
00:42:15,754 --> 00:42:18,290
They don't want us to play
"Dixie" at our schools.

604
00:42:18,891 --> 00:42:20,393
That's our song.

605
00:42:21,193 --> 00:42:24,328
They're angry when we fly the
Confederate flag at ball games.

606
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:28,533
And why should one of our boys
have to play ball under that flag?

607
00:42:28,535 --> 00:42:30,634
That flag is
our proud Southern history.

608
00:42:30,636 --> 00:42:33,204
It might be your proud
Southern history, C.P.,

609
00:42:33,206 --> 00:42:35,039
but it sure as hell
ain't ours.

610
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:36,042
All right.

611
00:42:36,843 --> 00:42:38,910
Integrated schools have
"blacks only" assemblies,

612
00:42:38,912 --> 00:42:41,446
"blacks only"
Martin Luther King this, that.

613
00:42:41,448 --> 00:42:42,713
That ain't my history.

614
00:42:42,715 --> 00:42:44,182
You wanna talk about schools?

615
00:42:44,184 --> 00:42:46,285
Let's talk about schools,
Mr. Riddick.

616
00:42:47,286 --> 00:42:49,221
My sons don't have it easy
in school.

617
00:42:50,055 --> 00:42:52,189
Their teachers ain't even
teachin' them half the time.

618
00:42:52,191 --> 00:42:54,226
And you want to throw them
together with a bunch of nigras?

619
00:42:54,593 --> 00:42:56,695
It's only gonna get worse
for them.

620
00:42:57,763 --> 00:43:00,400
You ask why?
I'm here to protect my boys.

621
00:43:01,501 --> 00:43:03,869
So all the better
if she don't get in my way.

622
00:43:09,442 --> 00:43:11,010
I'll sit with you,
Brother Ellis.

623
00:43:16,916 --> 00:43:20,452
Howard, have you lost
your everlasting mind,

624
00:43:20,454 --> 00:43:22,120
callin' that man
your brother?

625
00:43:22,122 --> 00:43:23,888
You're offering
to co-chair, Howard?

626
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:25,524
Uh, I am.

627
00:43:25,526 --> 00:43:27,692
And that's an honest man
right there, Ann.

628
00:43:27,694 --> 00:43:30,331
The only honest man
that's stood up today.

629
00:43:31,098 --> 00:43:34,067
He hates me.
And he told me why.

630
00:43:35,301 --> 00:43:39,272
But then he opened up
his heart about his sons.

631
00:43:39,671 --> 00:43:41,906
Why is he agreeing with me?

632
00:43:41,908 --> 00:43:44,108
- I don't know.
- That means he's my brother.

633
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,678
Did that nigger
just call me brother?

634
00:43:48,516 --> 00:43:49,782
Y'all hear that?

635
00:43:51,017 --> 00:43:53,621
I'll tell you what you are,
Howard.

636
00:43:54,421 --> 00:43:56,457
You one of them
"big niggers," ain't you?

637
00:43:57,291 --> 00:44:00,559
You done went up north
and got your college degree,

638
00:44:00,561 --> 00:44:04,031
your fancy cars,
and your fancy suits.

639
00:44:04,664 --> 00:44:06,932
Meanwhile, we down here on
the ground gettin' dirty.

640
00:44:06,934 --> 00:44:09,301
Now wait a minute, Ann.

641
00:44:09,303 --> 00:44:12,137
The Black Solidarity Committee has
been working within this community...

642
00:44:12,139 --> 00:44:14,508
Oh, shut up, Howard!
You're late to the fight!

643
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:19,880
And you have no idea what
real black folk go through.

644
00:44:20,381 --> 00:44:23,850
You don't deserve a seat.
He don't deserve that chair, he don't.

645
00:44:24,385 --> 00:44:26,320
Callin' that man his brother.

646
00:44:29,155 --> 00:44:31,358
So are you saying you'll accept
now, Miss Atwater?

647
00:45:17,905 --> 00:45:21,006
I'm going to continue to fight
for us white working men

648
00:45:21,008 --> 00:45:24,209
even if I have to sit in a room with
that awful Ann Atwater to do it.

649
00:45:26,046 --> 00:45:28,146
C.P. Ellis don't scare me.

650
00:45:28,148 --> 00:45:31,149
We gonna beat school
segregation once and for all.

651
00:45:31,151 --> 00:45:33,586
Well, she's livin'
in her own fantasy world.

652
00:45:33,588 --> 00:45:35,889
Folks in this town
like things the way they are.

653
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:50,463
Good morning, Mr. Ellis.

654
00:46:50,465 --> 00:46:52,666
Co-chair office is
just around the corner.

655
00:46:52,668 --> 00:46:53,803
Thank you.

656
00:47:16,258 --> 00:47:19,860
All I'm saying is
our children are way behind.

657
00:47:19,862 --> 00:47:21,562
Almost a full year.

658
00:47:21,564 --> 00:47:23,698
Well,
just havin' white teachers

659
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,602
isn't gonna help them
catch up.

660
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,503
White teachers?

661
00:47:28,505 --> 00:47:30,204
They already got
some white teachers.

662
00:47:30,206 --> 00:47:32,374
It ain't that.
It's about the books.

663
00:47:32,376 --> 00:47:35,041
Newer books don't account
for a whole year.

664
00:47:35,043 --> 00:47:37,313
Newer ain't got
nothing to do with it.

665
00:47:38,012 --> 00:47:40,781
Baby, what's your name?
In the red shirt. What's your name?

666
00:47:40,783 --> 00:47:42,318
- Miles.
- Miles.

667
00:47:43,052 --> 00:47:45,219
What year did you
just finish, Miles?

668
00:47:45,221 --> 00:47:46,854
- My junior year.
- Mm-hmm.

669
00:47:46,856 --> 00:47:48,958
And what year
were your books for?

670
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:52,192
The textbooks were
for the tenth-graders, ma'am.

671
00:47:56,899 --> 00:47:58,533
Well, how's that gonna work?

672
00:47:58,535 --> 00:48:00,668
How's what gonna work, C.P.?

673
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:03,573
You gonna put a bunch of black
kids who are a year behind...

674
00:48:04,441 --> 00:48:05,874
with white kids who aren't.

675
00:48:05,876 --> 00:48:07,742
How you gonna teach
that class?

676
00:48:07,744 --> 00:48:10,110
You can't.
It just ain't possible.

677
00:48:10,112 --> 00:48:12,980
So you go ahead
and get the right books,

678
00:48:12,982 --> 00:48:16,520
but you can't teach
that class, no way. No way.

679
00:48:45,582 --> 00:48:47,248
Okay. So tomorrow,

680
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,350
we'll break into
our smaller groups

681
00:48:49,352 --> 00:48:51,586
and begin hammering out the
different resolution points.

682
00:48:51,588 --> 00:48:54,622
But we meet back here
each night for wrap-up.

683
00:48:54,624 --> 00:48:57,893
Also, you've noticed these, uh,
two tables up here on the stage.

684
00:48:57,895 --> 00:49:01,262
Along with Mr. Ellis
and Miss Atwater,

685
00:49:01,264 --> 00:49:04,602
ten more of you will be chosen to fill
these seats as part of our senate.

686
00:49:04,968 --> 00:49:07,369
That senate will vote
on the resolutions

687
00:49:07,371 --> 00:49:09,071
on the final night
of the charrette.

688
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,440
Okay.
Unless there's anything else,

689
00:49:12,442 --> 00:49:14,110
I think we could all use
some sleep.

690
00:49:14,945 --> 00:49:16,110
Yes, Reverend?

691
00:49:16,112 --> 00:49:17,812
Mr. Riddick,

692
00:49:17,814 --> 00:49:19,683
it's been
quite a tense day.

693
00:49:20,417 --> 00:49:26,120
It may be wise if we have some
positive note to end each session.

694
00:49:26,122 --> 00:49:28,089
Something to lift our spirits.

695
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:30,191
I think that's a good idea,
Reverend.

696
00:49:30,193 --> 00:49:31,495
What did you have in mind?

697
00:49:31,863 --> 00:49:34,295
Well, I notice
we have a piano over here.

698
00:49:34,297 --> 00:49:37,566
What if we all sing gospel
music at the end of each night?

699
00:49:37,568 --> 00:49:39,303
- Okay.
- Nigger music.

700
00:49:40,271 --> 00:49:42,571
What did you say?

701
00:49:42,573 --> 00:49:45,274
I believe he said
that's nigger music.

702
00:49:45,276 --> 00:49:48,244
Gospel music don't have nothing
to do with black or white.

703
00:49:48,246 --> 00:49:51,480
- It's about God.
- Praise God, but he... he's right.

704
00:49:51,482 --> 00:49:54,350
Gospel music is absolutely
for black folk.

705
00:49:54,352 --> 00:49:56,719
I'm a bit surprised that
the reverend would suggest

706
00:49:56,721 --> 00:49:57,853
something so one-sided.

707
00:49:57,855 --> 00:49:59,454
I'm a little disappointed.

708
00:49:59,456 --> 00:50:01,024
Okay.
I can appreciate that, C.P.

709
00:50:01,391 --> 00:50:03,491
These people would like
gospel music.

710
00:50:03,493 --> 00:50:05,930
So, uh, how would you like
to represent your people?

711
00:50:08,331 --> 00:50:12,001
Well, I'd like to display our Klan
materials here at the charrette.

712
00:50:16,007 --> 00:50:17,141
Klan materials?

713
00:50:17,808 --> 00:50:19,043
Mm-hmm.

714
00:50:21,445 --> 00:50:24,113
- It's not the same thing.
- I know that.

715
00:50:24,115 --> 00:50:26,415
We can't let him do it. That stuff's
full of hate. That's all it is.

716
00:50:26,417 --> 00:50:28,818
- He gave on the gospel.
- I don't give a damn what he gave on.

717
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,887
Well, he gave, so we give.

718
00:50:30,889 --> 00:50:33,823
Bill Riddick, if that stuff shows up
here, it's gonna be a riot.

719
00:50:33,825 --> 00:50:36,392
And you can bet your ass I'm gonna
be the one leading the charge.

720
00:50:36,394 --> 00:50:38,797
Oh, you gonna get all
Roughhouse Annie on me now, huh?

721
00:50:39,297 --> 00:50:42,501
Yeah, I heard tell about you.
All talkin' and no listenin'.

722
00:50:43,167 --> 00:50:46,368
We're here trying to understand each
other for once and stop fighting.

723
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:49,038
I'll stop fightin' when there
ain't nothing left to fight for.

724
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,442
Then you gonna be goin' uphill
the rest of your life, Ann.

725
00:50:52,476 --> 00:50:55,244
In the meantime,
I'm-a keep that man here talkin'

726
00:50:55,246 --> 00:50:56,982
as long as I possibly can.

727
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:01,419
C.P.

728
00:51:02,721 --> 00:51:03,755
C.P.

729
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:08,858
This, um,
display you want to bring.

730
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,827
We're willing to go along
with it.

731
00:51:10,829 --> 00:51:12,562
But there'll be folks not wild
about the sight of it.

732
00:51:12,564 --> 00:51:14,764
So, uh, you're gonna need
to provide some security,

733
00:51:14,766 --> 00:51:16,700
someone to watch over it.

734
00:51:16,702 --> 00:51:18,203
I'm not gonna be responsible for it.

735
00:51:21,074 --> 00:51:22,541
This is my security.

736
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:24,978
That gun
don't belong here.

737
00:51:25,677 --> 00:51:29,448
I like to have it close in case I
need it to do my talkin' for me.

738
00:51:30,783 --> 00:51:32,918
This here does the talkin'
for me.

739
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:36,753
- I have a Bible.
- Oh, you do? Have you read it?

740
00:51:36,755 --> 00:51:38,122
Course I've read it.

741
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:40,957
- Even go to church on Sundays.
- Hmm.

742
00:51:40,959 --> 00:51:43,026
Well, then,
you ought to know, C.P.

743
00:51:43,028 --> 00:51:44,062
Know what?

744
00:51:44,963 --> 00:51:47,599
Same God made you, made me.

745
00:52:09,354 --> 00:52:10,788
That's everything,
Mr. Ellis.

746
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:12,592
Looks good, Ben. Real good.

747
00:52:12,892 --> 00:52:14,494
Thank you, Mr. Ellis.

748
00:52:25,604 --> 00:52:27,806
Divided according to race.

749
00:52:29,008 --> 00:52:31,243
Uh, six black, six white.

750
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:34,444
The senate members will float in
and out of different working groups,

751
00:52:34,446 --> 00:52:36,281
observing and participating.

752
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:38,783
On the final night
of the charrette,

753
00:52:38,785 --> 00:52:40,951
you will vote
to either adopt or reject

754
00:52:40,953 --> 00:52:42,620
the resolutions
presented to you.

755
00:52:42,622 --> 00:52:44,356
So, we're the final word?

756
00:52:44,624 --> 00:52:46,189
Final word, Howard.

757
00:52:46,191 --> 00:52:48,494
Two-thirds majority
to pass each resolution.

758
00:52:50,263 --> 00:52:51,698
Eight votes to pass?

759
00:52:52,832 --> 00:52:55,599
Then we should be able to handpick
the other four white members.

760
00:52:55,601 --> 00:52:57,768
Well, then, we might as well
go on home then.

761
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:59,403
C.P.,
that's not practical.

762
00:52:59,405 --> 00:53:00,840
We need to be
as fair as possible.

763
00:53:01,141 --> 00:53:03,741
I'm gonna have to side
with my friend here.

764
00:53:03,743 --> 00:53:06,178
I mean,
we can surely all agree

765
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,146
that every Negro
in the building

766
00:53:08,148 --> 00:53:10,014
is gonna vote yes
on school integration.

767
00:53:10,016 --> 00:53:12,149
That's six automatic votes,
no matter what.

768
00:53:12,151 --> 00:53:14,151
Same's not true
for every last white person.

769
00:53:14,153 --> 00:53:16,321
There's a bunch of liberals
sittin' out there right now.

770
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:22,194
Look, there are four prominent
organizations represented

771
00:53:22,196 --> 00:53:23,994
in this room, right here.

772
00:53:23,996 --> 00:53:26,464
The Klan,
The White Citizens' Council,

773
00:53:26,466 --> 00:53:28,868
Black Solidarity Committee,
and Operation Breakthrough.

774
00:53:29,635 --> 00:53:30,938
You each get your votes.

775
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:32,538
You want fair?

776
00:53:32,906 --> 00:53:34,808
We'll pick
eight regular members.

777
00:53:35,209 --> 00:53:38,611
Regular. No black power people, no Klan.
They're excluded.

778
00:53:39,747 --> 00:53:40,781
Agreed?

779
00:53:45,085 --> 00:53:46,918
- None of her people?
- No.

780
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,422
And none of y'all.

781
00:54:04,704 --> 00:54:05,738
Hey!

782
00:54:06,372 --> 00:54:08,608
What do you think
you doing, huh?

783
00:54:10,878 --> 00:54:12,744
Leave that alone.

784
00:54:12,746 --> 00:54:15,281
Boys need to be reading this
instead of ripping it up.

785
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:20,754
The Klan is givin' you
a window to look through.

786
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:25,224
You need to read this stuff
and understand it.

787
00:54:25,226 --> 00:54:26,693
That way,
you understand them.

788
00:54:27,027 --> 00:54:30,562
Okay? You got the upper hand.
Got it?

789
00:54:30,564 --> 00:54:32,934
Get on outta here, Charles.
Give me that.

790
00:54:33,734 --> 00:54:35,937
Should tell your daddy.
You know better.

791
00:54:44,145 --> 00:54:45,879
Kids don't make no sense...

792
00:55:17,111 --> 00:55:21,080
"...professional experts from in
the community and from outside

793
00:55:21,082 --> 00:55:23,983
will stand by
listening, learning."

794
00:55:50,945 --> 00:55:52,612
- Ann? Ann?
- What?

795
00:55:52,614 --> 00:55:54,649
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home.

796
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:57,183
Look,
I know you're upset, Ann.

797
00:55:57,185 --> 00:55:58,718
You don't know nothing!

798
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,320
I told you
it was a damn fool idea

799
00:56:00,322 --> 00:56:02,289
to let that man
bring that stuff in here.

800
00:56:02,291 --> 00:56:04,059
Ain't no good
gonna come from it!

801
00:56:04,459 --> 00:56:06,728
And I'll tell you
something else, Bill Riddick.

802
00:56:07,329 --> 00:56:08,761
You an even bigger fool

803
00:56:08,763 --> 00:56:10,396
if you think you gonna make
any change

804
00:56:10,398 --> 00:56:11,865
with this here meeting.

805
00:56:11,867 --> 00:56:13,202
- Is that right?
- That's right.

806
00:56:13,769 --> 00:56:16,236
'Cause as long as
the C.P. Ellises of the world

807
00:56:16,238 --> 00:56:17,571
keep gettin' their way,

808
00:56:17,573 --> 00:56:19,072
ain't nothing gonna change.

809
00:56:19,074 --> 00:56:21,376
Yeah, you talk about
Roughhouse Annie?

810
00:56:22,343 --> 00:56:25,177
Keep Uncle Tommin'
that cracker

811
00:56:25,179 --> 00:56:27,349
and you gonna see
Roughhouse Annie.

812
00:56:28,416 --> 00:56:31,419
Go on back up north where you belong,
'cause you don't know nothing.

813
00:57:04,753 --> 00:57:05,955
Marion Wilson.

814
00:57:13,661 --> 00:57:15,798
Okay. The other bowl now.

815
00:57:18,834 --> 00:57:19,868
<i>Sam Watford.</i>

816
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:23,472
- Is that Scooter Watford's boy?
- Yeah.

817
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:26,575
You won't have
a problem there.

818
00:57:27,309 --> 00:57:28,911
- You sure?
- Pretty sure.

819
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:32,045
I remember he kept losin' jobs
during them boycotts.

820
00:57:32,047 --> 00:57:33,416
Still pretty sore about it.

821
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,752
I don't like that mustache,
tell you what.

822
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,055
All right. Earl Weeks.

823
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,491
He's... He's with us.

824
00:57:42,758 --> 00:57:44,027
How do you know?

825
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:46,963
He been a deacon at my church
since I was a kid.

826
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,732
He don't like nobody.

827
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,468
- That's a good man.
- Two for two.

828
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:57,104
Okay, we gonna have an issue
with this gal Maddy Mays.

829
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:58,772
The blonde over by the window.

830
00:57:58,774 --> 00:58:00,140
Yeah, she's a nurse.

831
00:58:00,142 --> 00:58:01,643
Yeah, over at Durham Clinic.

832
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,680
Real "people person." I think
that's one to worry about.

833
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:07,914
Last is Lee Trombley.

834
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:10,318
Trombley Hardware.

835
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,421
Off of Route Nine.

836
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:14,222
What do we know?

837
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:15,825
I don't know 'bout him, C.P.

838
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:17,894
<i>Might be a problem there.</i>

839
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,897
<i>He took over
after his daddy passed.</i>

840
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:24,234
<i>Family man, two kids, I think.</i>

841
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:25,835
<i>And?</i>

842
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:28,936
<i>Everybody that
works for him is a nigger.</i>

843
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:29,973
<i>Every one.</i>

844
00:58:30,474 --> 00:58:32,510
And they all thick as thieves.

845
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:40,051
All right, I guess it's time we
get acquainted with Lee Trombley.

846
00:59:01,805 --> 00:59:02,906
Can I help you, sir?

847
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:06,243
Uh... Lee around?

848
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:09,244
No, sir. He's not here right now.
But I'm the manager.

849
00:59:09,246 --> 00:59:10,548
Something I can help you with?

850
00:59:13,184 --> 00:59:14,552
Uh, no. Um...

851
00:59:15,386 --> 00:59:16,987
I'll come back another time.

852
00:59:28,467 --> 00:59:29,534
Okay.

853
00:59:30,034 --> 00:59:32,735
Any thoughts, uh, insights?

854
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:35,406
You don't have to
raise your hand, Maddy.

855
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:38,108
I think it's nice to see
people talking for once.

856
00:59:38,542 --> 00:59:40,411
That ain't talkin'.
It's yellin'.

857
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:42,677
Well, okay. It's arguing.

858
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:45,981
But people are listening to one another.
They really are.

859
00:59:45,983 --> 00:59:49,750
They're arguing.
I've been listening to it for days,

860
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,788
and still no one's answered how
integration's gonna help my kids.

861
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:55,958
- It sure can't hurt 'em.
- It sure as hell can.

862
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,961
- I'd like to know how.
- Well, for one,

863
00:59:58,963 --> 01:00:01,932
I don't want my daughter sitting
next to a Negro boy in class.

864
01:00:02,366 --> 01:00:04,099
I don't want her
eatin' next to one,

865
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,269
and don't want her being
at a school dance with one.

866
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:08,607
So, you care
about your daughter?

867
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,640
And you don't want
to see her get hurt.

868
01:00:11,642 --> 01:00:13,309
What's your point?

869
01:00:13,311 --> 01:00:17,282
My point is that is
what we do as parents.

870
01:00:18,283 --> 01:00:22,184
When they're little, we try to
keep them from touching the stove

871
01:00:22,186 --> 01:00:23,387
so they don't burn.

872
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:27,558
We teach them to take small
bites so they don't choke.

873
01:00:28,359 --> 01:00:30,993
We worry about
their first day at school,

874
01:00:30,995 --> 01:00:32,495
the first time
they drive a car,

875
01:00:32,497 --> 01:00:34,263
their very first job.

876
01:00:34,265 --> 01:00:39,067
See, we want them to avoid
the pain that we experienced.

877
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:41,038
All right. All right.

878
01:00:41,339 --> 01:00:43,939
We all gonna sit around,
hold hands, sing "Kumbaya"?

879
01:00:43,941 --> 01:00:46,842
- We see what you're doing, Howard.
- And what is that, C.P.?

880
01:00:46,844 --> 01:00:49,179
That there's no difference
between blacks and whites, right?

881
01:00:49,181 --> 01:00:51,814
'Cause we all worry
about our kids.

882
01:00:51,816 --> 01:00:53,650
We're all the same, right?

883
01:00:53,652 --> 01:00:58,555
Actually, no, C.P. We're not.

884
01:00:58,557 --> 01:01:00,425
See, I left some things out.

885
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:03,693
I left out
that black folks have

886
01:01:03,695 --> 01:01:06,698
a whole different menu of pain
to worry about.

887
01:01:07,832 --> 01:01:10,669
Our kids get spit on
for no reason.

888
01:01:11,503 --> 01:01:16,374
Our kids have to move on the
sidewalk to let white folks pass,

889
01:01:17,008 --> 01:01:18,343
or they get beat.

890
01:01:19,411 --> 01:01:21,779
Our kids aren't allowed
to sit where they want,

891
01:01:22,214 --> 01:01:25,684
play where they want,
go to school where they want.

892
01:01:26,818 --> 01:01:31,187
See, this is the pain
they experience every day

893
01:01:31,189 --> 01:01:34,759
that we, we can't...
can't spare them from.

894
01:01:36,462 --> 01:01:39,164
And that is a...

895
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,901
It's a helpless feeling.

896
01:01:44,503 --> 01:01:47,540
A more helpless feeling
than you could ever know.

897
01:01:57,015 --> 01:01:59,349
- I fell right into that one.
- Yeah.

898
01:01:59,351 --> 01:02:01,953
- Shit. You see Trombley's face?
- Yeah.

899
01:02:02,688 --> 01:02:05,888
- Did you get anywhere with Trombley last night?
- He wasn't there.

900
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:08,226
They were right, though.
He got a black manager.

901
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:10,762
Well, where we gonna
get him, then?

902
01:02:11,196 --> 01:02:13,330
Right now.
We gonna crowd him at lunch.

903
01:02:13,332 --> 01:02:14,764
Mmm.

904
01:02:14,766 --> 01:02:16,736
Okay.
Everybody listen up.

905
01:02:17,902 --> 01:02:19,771
We're going to be trying
something different today.

906
01:02:20,172 --> 01:02:23,142
There are name cards at
each seat in this lunchroom.

907
01:02:23,542 --> 01:02:26,210
This will be your seat
for the rest of the charrette.

908
01:02:26,212 --> 01:02:28,281
You may not move
your name card.

909
01:02:29,282 --> 01:02:31,782
And you guessed it,
the person sitting next to you

910
01:02:31,784 --> 01:02:33,484
will not be
the same color as you.

911
01:02:33,486 --> 01:02:35,219
- What?
- And...

912
01:02:35,221 --> 01:02:39,056
And no discussion of issues
during this hour.

913
01:02:39,058 --> 01:02:40,293
Talk about something else.

914
01:04:06,714 --> 01:04:08,246
I just can't do it. Mm-mm.

915
01:04:08,248 --> 01:04:10,818
Mm-mm! Mm-mm-mm.

916
01:04:12,018 --> 01:04:14,087
These fish sticks is dry.

917
01:04:20,627 --> 01:04:22,095
Well... Hmm.

918
01:04:22,829 --> 01:04:24,765
If we can't change
anything else,

919
01:04:25,165 --> 01:04:27,634
we can sure demand
better school lunches, huh?

920
01:04:28,201 --> 01:04:30,103
We're not supposed to
talk about issues.

921
01:04:32,072 --> 01:04:33,473
I guess you're right.

922
01:04:40,213 --> 01:04:41,248
Howard...

923
01:04:42,048 --> 01:04:44,050
Howard was wrong in there,
weren't he?

924
01:04:44,752 --> 01:04:46,587
- Wrong?
- Mm-hmm.

925
01:04:48,256 --> 01:04:52,924
Well, I mean, he weren't wrong
about what black kids go through.

926
01:04:52,926 --> 01:04:53,960
But...

927
01:04:55,430 --> 01:05:00,301
He was wrong about you not knowing
what helpless is, weren't he?

928
01:05:03,772 --> 01:05:04,972
What does that mean?

929
01:05:09,142 --> 01:05:11,478
You got a boy out at Murdock,
don't you, C.P.?

930
01:05:11,913 --> 01:05:13,913
- I don't wanna talk about that.
- I'm just trying...

931
01:05:13,915 --> 01:05:16,584
Ann, don't talk about my son.

932
01:05:18,218 --> 01:05:20,455
- Don't ever talk about my son.
- Okay.

933
01:05:47,583 --> 01:05:49,916
We're willing to go
to summer school,

934
01:05:49,918 --> 01:05:52,151
even nights, just to catch
up with the white students.

935
01:05:52,153 --> 01:05:55,290
Good Lord never intended for
blacks to have equal rights.

936
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,768
- Daddy!
- What's wrong? What's wrong, sugar?

937
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:14,804
It's Larry.

938
01:07:25,848 --> 01:07:28,649
What's goin' on?

939
01:07:28,651 --> 01:07:31,218
- Who is this?
- Alvin. He moved in Friday.

940
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:34,021
Hey, hey.
Shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh.

941
01:07:36,191 --> 01:07:38,427
Hey, pumpkin.

942
01:07:39,595 --> 01:07:41,428
- Go! It's okay.
- It's okay.

943
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:43,798
No monster.
No monster, son. No monster.

944
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,432
I got your book.
I'm gonna read...

945
01:07:45,434 --> 01:07:47,100
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh.

946
01:07:47,102 --> 01:07:48,236
It's Vickie.

947
01:07:48,538 --> 01:07:50,236
- Read to him.
- Okay.

948
01:07:50,238 --> 01:07:52,673
- Come here, pumpkin.
- I'll be right back.

949
01:07:52,675 --> 01:07:55,378
- Vickie's gonna read to you.
- It's your sister, Vickie.

950
01:07:55,945 --> 01:07:57,145
Get him out.

951
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:03,718
- Hey, who's in charge here?
- Can I help you, Mr. Ellis?

952
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,886
No. Is there someone else
I can talk to?

953
01:08:05,888 --> 01:08:07,121
One moment.

954
01:08:07,123 --> 01:08:08,157
Hey.

955
01:08:11,996 --> 01:08:13,628
Hey.

956
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:14,930
- I'll be right there.
- I need help.

957
01:08:14,932 --> 01:08:16,564
- No, sir. No, sir.
- I need help.

958
01:08:16,566 --> 01:08:18,232
- My son needs help.
- Step outside that door.

959
01:08:18,234 --> 01:08:20,101
- I need to get my son out of that room.
- Yes, sir.

960
01:08:20,103 --> 01:08:22,235
Step outside for a moment.

961
01:08:22,237 --> 01:08:24,572
- Now calm it down.
- I need to get my son out of that room.

962
01:08:24,574 --> 01:08:26,741
- Your son is gonna be just fine.
- He's scared.

963
01:08:26,743 --> 01:08:28,244
He's not fine.
He needs to be moved.

964
01:08:28,478 --> 01:08:30,411
Right away.
Or that other one needs to be moved.

965
01:08:30,413 --> 01:08:32,713
- My son's scared.
- Look. Look.

966
01:08:32,715 --> 01:08:35,349
It's important that our patients
stay in familiar surroundings.

967
01:08:35,351 --> 01:08:38,252
'Cause if they're moved
too often, they get agitated...

968
01:08:38,254 --> 01:08:40,022
A private room then.

969
01:08:40,024 --> 01:08:41,790
Give Larry a private room,
please.

970
01:08:41,792 --> 01:08:43,357
We have regulations
here at Murdock.

971
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:45,626
I don't care
about your regulations.

972
01:08:45,628 --> 01:08:48,864
- Now you move him, or I will. How's that?
- No, you will not.

973
01:08:48,866 --> 01:08:52,868
Mr. Ellis!
Call security right now.

974
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:54,972
You calm yourself down.

975
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:00,210
God...

976
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:02,846
How much...
How much is it again?

977
01:09:03,213 --> 01:09:07,315
A private room is $75 more
per week.

978
01:09:07,317 --> 01:09:09,019
Now do you wanna pay for that?

979
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:11,786
I got 16.

980
01:09:11,788 --> 01:09:13,857
Mr. Ellis.
Listen to me.

981
01:09:14,524 --> 01:09:17,627
Larry will get used to it,
all right?

982
01:09:22,432 --> 01:09:25,834
You shoulda told me. No one told
me that boy would be in this room.

983
01:09:25,836 --> 01:09:27,102
- It was...
- No one told me.

984
01:09:27,104 --> 01:09:28,637
It was a last minute...

985
01:09:28,639 --> 01:09:29,840
You shoulda told me.

986
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,513
You know,
I'm tryin' to tell you now.

987
01:10:11,515 --> 01:10:14,050
His roommate was wailin'
and screamin' and...

988
01:10:14,052 --> 01:10:15,686
But they wouldn't
let me move him.

989
01:10:18,857 --> 01:10:20,290
I wanna take him home.

990
01:10:22,026 --> 01:10:23,595
He's better off with us.

991
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:27,732
He don't belong there.

992
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:29,567
He ain't like them others.

993
01:10:31,369 --> 01:10:33,538
<i>Yes, Claiborne, he is.</i>

994
01:10:37,109 --> 01:10:39,844
<i>I'm seeing him tomorrow.
I'm sure he's fine.</i>

995
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:42,445
<i>You okay?</i>

996
01:10:42,447 --> 01:10:43,948
Yeah, I'm just tired.

997
01:10:46,151 --> 01:10:48,086
I'll see you at home.
I love you.

998
01:13:25,412 --> 01:13:26,645
Can I help you?

999
01:13:27,247 --> 01:13:29,249
You can't,
but Bernadette can.

1000
01:13:30,583 --> 01:13:32,252
- One moment.
- Thank you.

1001
01:13:38,091 --> 01:13:40,591
Miss Atwater!

1002
01:13:40,593 --> 01:13:45,431
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
How have you been?

1003
01:13:45,433 --> 01:13:48,400
Oh, baby, I've been good.
How about yourself?

1004
01:13:48,402 --> 01:13:50,568
I'm fine. I'm just fine.

1005
01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:52,340
Well,
what can I help you with?

1006
01:13:54,442 --> 01:13:56,443
Where's that Larry Ellis boy?

1007
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,521
Bernadette.

1008
01:14:09,189 --> 01:14:12,058
- Yes, Miss Atwater?
- I'm gonna need a favor.

1009
01:14:13,493 --> 01:14:15,960
- But that's not fair.
- I know it's not fair, honey.

1010
01:14:15,962 --> 01:14:18,063
But I went back and looked.
Not even half of them are done yet.

1011
01:14:18,065 --> 01:14:19,697
But she never does
any of her charts.

1012
01:14:19,699 --> 01:14:21,766
She always expects us
to do them for her.

1013
01:14:21,768 --> 01:14:24,472
You and I have to go over all her
work, or it's gonna be on us.

1014
01:14:33,781 --> 01:14:34,815
Hello?

1015
01:14:36,650 --> 01:14:37,685
Hello?

1016
01:14:38,085 --> 01:14:40,085
Where's Larry? Where's my son?

1017
01:14:40,087 --> 01:14:41,289
He's not in his room.
What happened?

1018
01:14:41,522 --> 01:14:43,392
Nothing happened, Miss Ellis.

1019
01:14:43,823 --> 01:14:45,158
He was moved.

1020
01:14:52,565 --> 01:14:53,733
It's so nice.

1021
01:14:57,371 --> 01:14:58,406
Hey, baby.

1022
01:14:59,073 --> 01:15:00,374
It's your mama.

1023
01:15:02,209 --> 01:15:03,744
Hey, baby, it's your mama.

1024
01:15:04,011 --> 01:15:05,546
- Hi.
- Hi.

1025
01:15:06,881 --> 01:15:08,416
Let's put on some music.

1026
01:15:21,629 --> 01:15:22,663
What?

1027
01:15:24,565 --> 01:15:27,035
No, no, it's good. It's...

1028
01:15:29,004 --> 01:15:30,338
It's just, uh...

1029
01:15:33,874 --> 01:15:35,443
All right,
I'll see you at home.

1030
01:15:48,256 --> 01:15:50,925
- I want to talk to you.
- Finally.

1031
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:52,960
Look. What you, uh...

1032
01:15:54,595 --> 01:15:56,965
I didn't... I...

1033
01:16:00,168 --> 01:16:02,068
I didn't ask for your help.

1034
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:04,270
I can take care of
my own family, okay?

1035
01:16:04,272 --> 01:16:05,872
- Okay.
- Okay.

1036
01:16:05,874 --> 01:16:07,774
Okay.
It's just what I do, C.P.

1037
01:16:07,776 --> 01:16:10,877
Well, whatever is you do,
don't do it for me.

1038
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:12,247
I didn't do it for you.

1039
01:16:24,526 --> 01:16:26,926
- Strike one!
- Yeah, Chester, bring the heat!

1040
01:16:26,928 --> 01:16:29,064
All right, shut your hole.
That ain't helping.

1041
01:16:31,699 --> 01:16:35,737
Don't pay him no mind, boy.
He ain't goin' nowhere with two outs.

1042
01:16:36,805 --> 01:16:38,406
They'll hold 'em.
Be all right.

1043
01:16:52,121 --> 01:16:53,156
I'll be right back.

1044
01:17:01,497 --> 01:17:03,166
- Your boy playing today?
- Oh.

1045
01:17:03,966 --> 01:17:05,034
Mr. Ellis.

1046
01:17:05,768 --> 01:17:07,969
Uh, no. My nephew.

1047
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:10,203
You can call me C.P.
You want a beer?

1048
01:17:10,205 --> 01:17:11,437
Oh. Thanks.

1049
01:17:11,439 --> 01:17:12,707
Strike!

1050
01:17:15,343 --> 01:17:17,580
So, how do you think
it's going? The charrette.

1051
01:17:19,014 --> 01:17:20,349
Um...

1052
01:17:21,049 --> 01:17:22,050
It's interesting.

1053
01:17:23,319 --> 01:17:25,188
It's nice to hear
both sides, you know.

1054
01:17:25,488 --> 01:17:26,988
Yeah. Yeah.

1055
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:30,660
We got some decisions to make.

1056
01:17:31,494 --> 01:17:33,093
Strike three! You're out!

1057
01:17:35,697 --> 01:17:37,967
Say, that nigger fella?
The one that comes, uh...

1058
01:17:40,503 --> 01:17:42,071
He runs your hardware store?

1059
01:17:42,438 --> 01:17:44,641
Yeah. 'Bout two years now.

1060
01:17:45,007 --> 01:17:46,108
His name's Emmett.

1061
01:17:47,043 --> 01:17:49,845
And you trust him to...
to run things?

1062
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:55,549
Sorry, I-I'm just curious.

1063
01:17:55,551 --> 01:17:59,422
I don't think I could trust one
of them to run my filling station.

1064
01:18:00,223 --> 01:18:02,724
Other than my wife,
he's the only person I trust.

1065
01:18:03,392 --> 01:18:04,525
How's that?

1066
01:18:04,527 --> 01:18:06,562
Well, he and I, we...

1067
01:18:08,831 --> 01:18:10,433
We were in Vietnam together.

1068
01:18:12,235 --> 01:18:14,538
- Oh. You were in Vietnam?
- Yeah.

1069
01:18:14,904 --> 01:18:17,373
Two tours. Got out in '68.

1070
01:18:17,873 --> 01:18:18,941
You?

1071
01:18:19,543 --> 01:18:21,143
No. No, I...

1072
01:18:23,547 --> 01:18:24,648
No.

1073
01:18:26,683 --> 01:18:27,750
Yeah.

1074
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:30,884
Well, look, Mr. Ellis,
I know who you are.

1075
01:18:30,886 --> 01:18:32,387
And I know
what you want from me.

1076
01:18:32,389 --> 01:18:34,322
- But I just don't...
- No, no, Lee.

1077
01:18:34,324 --> 01:18:36,324
Any man who served bravely
in this country's military

1078
01:18:36,326 --> 01:18:38,395
doesn't need to hear
anything more from me.

1079
01:18:39,096 --> 01:18:40,631
You vote how you want to.

1080
01:18:41,398 --> 01:18:42,466
I'll respect it.

1081
01:18:46,035 --> 01:18:47,069
Mr. Ellis?

1082
01:18:49,038 --> 01:18:50,707
Emmett served
this country, too.

1083
01:18:52,342 --> 01:18:54,645
And he was a lot braver
than me.

1084
01:19:09,926 --> 01:19:12,494
All right, folks.
For our last day,

1085
01:19:12,496 --> 01:19:14,162
I thought we'd go
on a little field trip.

1086
01:19:14,164 --> 01:19:16,732
- Where to?
- You gotta vote Monday night.

1087
01:19:16,734 --> 01:19:19,100
I think it's important
we get a firsthand look

1088
01:19:19,102 --> 01:19:20,937
at what we've been talkin'
about the past few weeks.

1089
01:19:44,762 --> 01:19:47,297
I know it's been a long
day, but this is the last one.

1090
01:19:48,599 --> 01:19:50,668
Please be careful.
Watch your step.

1091
01:19:51,068 --> 01:19:54,572
Ain't no better over here.
It's a mess.

1092
01:19:54,971 --> 01:19:57,473
They gotta keep the doors open
because of the smell.

1093
01:19:57,475 --> 01:19:59,475
- I imagine so.
- It helps.

1094
01:20:03,981 --> 01:20:05,815
Lot of kids
for summer school.

1095
01:20:05,817 --> 01:20:08,186
Uh...
That ain't summer school, C.P.

1096
01:20:08,953 --> 01:20:11,187
They still tryin' to finish up
from last year.

1097
01:20:11,189 --> 01:20:14,023
Yes, because of the split
shifts after the fire,

1098
01:20:14,025 --> 01:20:15,692
the students
were really only getting

1099
01:20:15,694 --> 01:20:18,127
about three hours
of schooling per day.

1100
01:20:18,129 --> 01:20:20,163
So, they're still catching up.

1101
01:20:21,965 --> 01:20:24,367
Hey, how you doin'?
Did you get them shoes I sent you?

1102
01:20:24,369 --> 01:20:25,835
Mama!

1103
01:20:25,837 --> 01:20:28,071
- Hey.
- Oh, this your girl?

1104
01:20:29,207 --> 01:20:30,441
- Hey.
- Hi.

1105
01:20:31,309 --> 01:20:34,312
Marilynn,
this here is, uh, Mr. Ellis.

1106
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:37,148
Oh.

1107
01:20:38,483 --> 01:20:40,251
Well, I better get to class.

1108
01:20:40,952 --> 01:20:42,086
Okay.

1109
01:20:50,328 --> 01:20:52,765
She looked at me like I was
some kind of monster.

1110
01:20:54,065 --> 01:20:55,333
What'd you expect?

1111
01:20:57,803 --> 01:20:59,736
I don't know.
I'm trying to do right by us.

1112
01:20:59,738 --> 01:21:01,238
Make it all better.

1113
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:03,275
And how's this gonna
make it all better?

1114
01:21:03,876 --> 01:21:05,709
Hell, I'm...

1115
01:21:05,711 --> 01:21:07,877
They wanted to integrate restaurants.
So we did.

1116
01:21:07,879 --> 01:21:10,446
Then came buses and bathrooms
and playgrounds.

1117
01:21:10,448 --> 01:21:12,214
Look, I'm over there right now

1118
01:21:12,216 --> 01:21:14,116
supporting more funding
to make their schools better.

1119
01:21:14,118 --> 01:21:16,218
If they have nicer schools, they'll...

1120
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:18,053
...stop pushin'
to integrate ours.

1121
01:21:18,055 --> 01:21:19,957
The one thing we have left.

1122
01:21:20,258 --> 01:21:22,260
Then maybe
we'll all stop fighting.

1123
01:21:22,594 --> 01:21:23,928
Then what you gonna do?

1124
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:26,964
What?

1125
01:21:28,199 --> 01:21:30,235
When everybody stops fighting,
who you gonna fight?

1126
01:22:42,675 --> 01:22:44,176
Okay. Coming.

1127
01:22:50,349 --> 01:22:51,749
Can I help you?

1128
01:22:51,751 --> 01:22:53,620
Hi, Ann. Um...

1129
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:56,355
I'm Mary Ellis.
Claiborne's wife.

1130
01:22:58,858 --> 01:23:00,025
Oh.

1131
01:23:00,527 --> 01:23:03,195
I'm sorry
for just dropping by. I, um...

1132
01:23:04,364 --> 01:23:08,066
I wanted to thank you for, um,
what you did

1133
01:23:08,568 --> 01:23:10,270
for our family,
for our son Larry.

1134
01:23:12,539 --> 01:23:13,673
Please, come in.

1135
01:23:17,477 --> 01:23:18,745
- Thanks.
- Go on in.

1136
01:23:22,917 --> 01:23:25,719
- Hope you like sweet tea.
- I do.

1137
01:23:28,522 --> 01:23:31,357
So Larry is doing better, huh?

1138
01:23:32,025 --> 01:23:33,191
He is.

1139
01:23:33,826 --> 01:23:35,728
You know,
sometimes it's hard to...

1140
01:23:37,263 --> 01:23:39,599
- keep him calm.
- Mm.

1141
01:23:42,201 --> 01:23:45,738
Well, has, uh...
has Larry always been like that?

1142
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:47,407
Yeah.

1143
01:23:48,575 --> 01:23:50,911
You know, when he was little,
it just...

1144
01:23:51,678 --> 01:23:53,681
He started not to be able
to do things.

1145
01:23:58,852 --> 01:24:01,152
Has C.P. always been
like that?

1146
01:24:01,154 --> 01:24:03,021
Oh.

1147
01:24:03,023 --> 01:24:04,058
Yes.

1148
01:24:05,826 --> 01:24:06,860
More or less.

1149
01:24:09,196 --> 01:24:12,764
You know, he used to be
a really good baseball player.

1150
01:24:12,766 --> 01:24:14,199
- Really?
- Showed a lot of promise.

1151
01:24:14,201 --> 01:24:15,467
Colleges came
and looked at him

1152
01:24:15,469 --> 01:24:17,805
right over here
at Liberty Park.

1153
01:24:18,939 --> 01:24:20,438
Where we met, actually.

1154
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,342
Came up to me,
he's so nervous.

1155
01:24:23,142 --> 01:24:25,511
Couldn't even talk.
So handsome.

1156
01:24:26,145 --> 01:24:28,446
Oh.

1157
01:24:28,448 --> 01:24:29,482
What?

1158
01:24:30,116 --> 01:24:32,019
- C.P. handsome?
- Oh.

1159
01:24:33,053 --> 01:24:34,153
He was.

1160
01:24:37,257 --> 01:24:38,459
Okay.

1161
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:42,097
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

1162
01:24:44,099 --> 01:24:45,132
Thank you again.

1163
01:24:45,366 --> 01:24:46,400
You're welcome.

1164
01:24:52,272 --> 01:24:54,941
- Ann...
- Yes?

1165
01:24:54,943 --> 01:24:56,678
Claiborne is, uh...

1166
01:24:59,814 --> 01:25:01,516
He's doing
the best he can.

1167
01:25:04,619 --> 01:25:05,952
Bye.

1168
01:25:05,954 --> 01:25:07,121
Good-bye, Miss Ellis.

1169
01:25:28,643 --> 01:25:30,308
Gimme a minute with C.P.,
would you?

1170
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:31,546
Sure thing, Floyd.

1171
01:25:50,132 --> 01:25:52,034
Hey. What do you say, Floyd?

1172
01:25:54,636 --> 01:25:55,703
You got one of those?

1173
01:26:03,945 --> 01:26:05,345
See the paper?

1174
01:26:06,346 --> 01:26:09,384
Nothin' I could do about that.
All part of this charrette business.

1175
01:26:14,389 --> 01:26:16,090
It don't look right.

1176
01:26:16,092 --> 01:26:17,757
It don't matter
what it looks like, Floyd.

1177
01:26:17,759 --> 01:26:19,059
Matters what it is.

1178
01:26:19,061 --> 01:26:20,428
Oh, yeah.

1179
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:24,232
Your wife making friends
with Ann Atwater what it is?

1180
01:26:25,667 --> 01:26:26,701
What?

1181
01:26:28,269 --> 01:26:30,139
Couple of the boys
saw 'em today.

1182
01:26:32,273 --> 01:26:33,876
How am I supposed to
explain that?

1183
01:26:40,916 --> 01:26:42,750
She did something for Larry
is all.

1184
01:26:42,752 --> 01:26:44,619
Mary was just
probably thanking her.

1185
01:26:45,253 --> 01:26:47,353
Niggers is doing you
favors now, C.P.?

1186
01:26:47,355 --> 01:26:49,023
Stop with the bullshit, Floyd.

1187
01:26:49,424 --> 01:26:51,060
Mary's always gone
her own way.

1188
01:26:51,726 --> 01:26:54,594
Has nothin' to do with how
I do my business. Never has.

1189
01:26:54,596 --> 01:26:56,232
Now you got something to say?
Say it.

1190
01:26:58,901 --> 01:27:00,468
Look around you, C.P.

1191
01:27:00,870 --> 01:27:03,371
All these guys,
they look up to you.

1192
01:27:03,939 --> 01:27:05,141
They need you.

1193
01:27:06,407 --> 01:27:08,778
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm here, ain't I?

1194
01:27:09,512 --> 01:27:12,548
- Are you?
- I'm doin' everything I can.

1195
01:28:12,976 --> 01:28:15,478
Hey. Is Mr. Trombley in?

1196
01:28:15,946 --> 01:28:17,814
- Yes, sir. He's...
- Can I help you?

1197
01:28:18,515 --> 01:28:19,682
Mr. Trombley.

1198
01:28:20,683 --> 01:28:23,652
We're from Durham Fire and
Life Safety Department. Uh...

1199
01:28:24,287 --> 01:28:26,189
We've got a random
inspection order here.

1200
01:28:26,655 --> 01:28:27,891
On a Sunday?

1201
01:28:29,491 --> 01:28:30,994
We do 'em when they come in.

1202
01:28:31,627 --> 01:28:33,828
We'll need access
to your breaker panels

1203
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:36,166
and your hazardous materials
storage area.

1204
01:28:36,633 --> 01:28:40,003
Yeah, all right. Sure.
Uh, come on back. Right this way.

1205
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:45,473
So, Mr. Trombley, it, uh,

1206
01:28:45,475 --> 01:28:47,141
seems your
circuit breaker panels

1207
01:28:47,143 --> 01:28:49,043
are not up to code.

1208
01:28:49,045 --> 01:28:51,813
You need at least 30-inch
clearance on both sides,

1209
01:28:51,815 --> 01:28:53,583
and you've got
a little under two feet.

1210
01:28:55,485 --> 01:29:00,521
Oh... They've been like
that for 20 years, since I was a kid.

1211
01:29:00,523 --> 01:29:04,527
Nevertheless, that needs to be
rectified before you can, uh, reopen.

1212
01:29:05,162 --> 01:29:09,599
- Reopen?
- Yeah. Gotta shut you down... indefinitely.

1213
01:29:10,367 --> 01:29:14,469
What? Oh, no. I...
See, I can't shut down.

1214
01:29:14,471 --> 01:29:16,506
I got...
I got a business here... Th...

1215
01:29:19,542 --> 01:29:21,578
What are they supposed to do?

1216
01:29:25,349 --> 01:29:28,986
I'm gonna need them boys
outta here... now.

1217
01:29:32,390 --> 01:29:33,657
Like I said...

1218
01:29:35,458 --> 01:29:37,627
if you fix things...

1219
01:29:39,063 --> 01:29:41,098
you'll be open again
in no time.

1220
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:46,170
You have a nice day,
Mr. Trombley.

1221
01:30:39,758 --> 01:30:41,559
My, my, my.

1222
01:30:42,593 --> 01:30:44,462
Aren't you
a pretty little thing?

1223
01:30:45,196 --> 01:30:46,364
Who are you?

1224
01:30:47,198 --> 01:30:48,299
What do you want?

1225
01:30:48,933 --> 01:30:51,569
Take it easy, Maddy.
We're just, uh,

1226
01:30:52,437 --> 01:30:54,171
friends.

1227
01:30:56,007 --> 01:30:57,175
Please don't.

1228
01:30:57,842 --> 01:31:00,611
Shh. It's okay.

1229
01:31:05,083 --> 01:31:07,319
None of these pictures
have niggers in 'em.

1230
01:31:10,288 --> 01:31:13,058
We heard you might be
a friend of niggers.

1231
01:31:13,358 --> 01:31:15,794
But I don't see none
on this wall.

1232
01:31:18,464 --> 01:31:21,967
Just to be sure though,
we're gonna need to hear you say it.

1233
01:31:23,503 --> 01:31:24,536
Say it?

1234
01:31:26,872 --> 01:31:27,906
Yes.

1235
01:31:28,907 --> 01:31:29,941
Say it.

1236
01:31:30,708 --> 01:31:33,378
That you ain't
a friend of niggers.

1237
01:31:35,213 --> 01:31:39,851
I'm... not
a friend of niggers.

1238
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:45,257
Again.

1239
01:31:46,191 --> 01:31:49,361
I'm not a friend
of niggers.

1240
01:31:57,203 --> 01:31:58,237
Well, then.

1241
01:31:58,637 --> 01:32:00,739
We must've got
some bad information.

1242
01:32:01,873 --> 01:32:04,609
Guess there was no need
for the visit after all.

1243
01:32:10,049 --> 01:32:11,451
Thanks for the beer, Maddy.

1244
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:28,967
- Hey.
- Beer, C.P.?

1245
01:32:29,935 --> 01:32:31,404
Yeah. Thanks, Doreen.

1246
01:32:42,448 --> 01:32:43,648
C.P.!

1247
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:45,983
Hey, C.P.!

1248
01:32:45,985 --> 01:32:47,418
What do you say, boys?

1249
01:32:47,420 --> 01:32:49,755
Come on, sit down.

1250
01:32:50,323 --> 01:32:52,990
Nah. Been a long week.

1251
01:32:52,992 --> 01:32:55,059
Just gonna have one beer
and go.

1252
01:32:55,061 --> 01:32:57,663
Oh, come on, C.P.
We celebratin'.

1253
01:32:58,131 --> 01:33:01,098
Yeah. What are you
celebratin', Wiley?

1254
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:05,072
We celebrating
you gettin' your votes, C.P.

1255
01:33:05,705 --> 01:33:08,941
Well, a little early for that,
don't you think?

1256
01:33:09,308 --> 01:33:11,144
But have fun.

1257
01:33:18,651 --> 01:33:20,419
What do you know about votes,
Wiley?

1258
01:33:35,502 --> 01:33:37,835
You shut him down?

1259
01:33:37,837 --> 01:33:39,538
What are you doin' here, C.P.?

1260
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:41,139
- You shut him down.
- What are you talking about?

1261
01:33:41,141 --> 01:33:43,210
- Lee Trombley.
- Is that what this is about?

1262
01:33:43,709 --> 01:33:47,045
You didn't have to do that, Carvie.
You didn't have to do that.

1263
01:33:47,047 --> 01:33:49,881
This not a good time to show up, C.P.
I got donors in there.

1264
01:33:49,883 --> 01:33:51,683
You haven't answered
my question.

1265
01:33:51,685 --> 01:33:53,854
We're just trying
to give you a leg up is all.

1266
01:33:54,687 --> 01:33:57,688
Call it insurance, whatever you want.
You got a big vote tomorrow.

1267
01:33:57,690 --> 01:33:59,890
That man served his country,
Carvie.

1268
01:33:59,892 --> 01:34:02,194
Two tours in Vietnam.
He's a working man with a family.

1269
01:34:02,196 --> 01:34:04,429
- Well...
- "Protect the white working man."

1270
01:34:04,431 --> 01:34:06,264
Isn't that what you always said,
what we always talked about?

1271
01:34:06,266 --> 01:34:11,438
C.P., sometimes there are
necessary evils.

1272
01:34:12,005 --> 01:34:14,641
Necessary evils
for the greater good.

1273
01:34:15,108 --> 01:34:17,042
And it's my job to make
those kind of decisions.

1274
01:34:17,044 --> 01:34:18,812
You're just gonna
have to trust me on this.

1275
01:34:23,283 --> 01:34:24,985
You should get
back to your party.

1276
01:34:26,621 --> 01:34:28,889
C.P.? Are we good?

1277
01:34:50,712 --> 01:34:53,146
Hey, Floyd called.
Said they want you at Klavern.

1278
01:34:56,584 --> 01:34:57,719
Klavern?

1279
01:35:00,455 --> 01:35:02,789
Something about a meeting
at 8:30 or something.

1280
01:35:04,359 --> 01:35:05,526
What? You didn't know?

1281
01:35:07,428 --> 01:35:09,364
Oh. You all right?

1282
01:35:10,365 --> 01:35:11,466
You look tired.

1283
01:35:15,903 --> 01:35:17,105
Yeah, I'm all right.

1284
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:20,408
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1285
01:36:50,632 --> 01:36:52,868
He's here.

1286
01:37:02,411 --> 01:37:03,546
Come on up, C.P.

1287
01:37:15,791 --> 01:37:16,759
Hey.

1288
01:37:17,359 --> 01:37:18,527
What's goin' on?

1289
01:37:20,529 --> 01:37:22,431
Distinguished Klansmen,

1290
01:37:22,832 --> 01:37:27,067
every now and again,
extraordinary things occur within our walls

1291
01:37:27,069 --> 01:37:28,504
that need to be addressed.

1292
01:37:29,538 --> 01:37:33,610
As your state leader,
it is my job to address them.

1293
01:37:34,376 --> 01:37:36,544
In our fight
against communism,

1294
01:37:36,546 --> 01:37:39,047
against integration,
against mongrelism...

1295
01:37:40,350 --> 01:37:42,550
we turn to those among us

1296
01:37:42,552 --> 01:37:47,290
who can lead us into
a pure, white future.

1297
01:37:48,425 --> 01:37:51,795
We have one such man
here in North Carolina.

1298
01:37:53,696 --> 01:37:56,764
Your Exhalted Cyclops,
C.P. Ellis.

1299
01:38:04,940 --> 01:38:10,580
So, in recognition
of this man's tireless effort,

1300
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:12,847
for his forethought and vision

1301
01:38:12,849 --> 01:38:15,652
in establishing the UKA's
first Youth Corps...

1302
01:38:17,253 --> 01:38:18,922
I guess I'll just read this.

1303
01:38:19,923 --> 01:38:23,092
It says,
"The United Klans of America

1304
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:26,762
hereby bestow upon
Mr. Claiborne Paul Ellis

1305
01:38:26,764 --> 01:38:29,297
the honor of being named

1306
01:38:29,299 --> 01:38:34,304
North Carolina's 'Exhalted'
Cyclops of the Year, 1971."

1307
01:39:12,476 --> 01:39:15,844
What do you mean, you're not the right
person? Baby, the vote is tonight.

1308
01:39:15,846 --> 01:39:18,747
- Yeah, but there's gotta be somebody else.
- There's nobody else, Maddy.

1309
01:39:18,749 --> 01:39:20,449
You heard everything,
you've seen everything.

1310
01:39:20,451 --> 01:39:21,917
No one else can take
your seat.

1311
01:39:21,919 --> 01:39:23,387
What brought this on, Maddy?

1312
01:39:24,990 --> 01:39:26,622
What happened?

1313
01:39:26,624 --> 01:39:28,459
Nothing. I just...

1314
01:39:31,661 --> 01:39:35,465
It's nothing. Um... It's fine.
If you'll just excuse me.

1315
01:39:35,799 --> 01:39:37,367
Mm-hmm.

1316
01:39:49,914 --> 01:39:52,082
Maddy Mays don't want to vote.

1317
01:39:52,716 --> 01:39:54,920
Just like that, out of the blue.

1318
01:39:57,154 --> 01:39:59,022
- What'd you do to that girl?
- Now, Ann.

1319
01:39:59,024 --> 01:40:00,859
I saw the way she looked...
Don't you "Now, Ann" me.

1320
01:40:02,027 --> 01:40:03,828
You coward.

1321
01:40:04,428 --> 01:40:06,731
- I ain't no coward.
- Yeah, you a coward.

1322
01:40:06,998 --> 01:40:10,165
Couldn't do it in here.
Too many people with they own thoughts.

1323
01:40:10,167 --> 01:40:12,936
You couldn't win in here,
so you went and you fixed it out there.

1324
01:40:12,938 --> 01:40:14,773
- I don't have to listen to this.
- You gonna listen today.

1325
01:40:16,206 --> 01:40:18,275
What you so afraid of, C.P.?

1326
01:40:18,876 --> 01:40:21,075
- I ain't afraid of nothing.
- Yeah, you is. You're afraid.

1327
01:40:21,077 --> 01:40:23,145
You afraid
you gonna lose control.

1328
01:40:23,147 --> 01:40:26,081
You afraid you gonna lose
what you ain't even got, C.P.!

1329
01:40:26,083 --> 01:40:28,250
You're poor.
Just like the rest of us.

1330
01:40:28,252 --> 01:40:30,085
You ain't got nothing
'cept problems.

1331
01:40:30,087 --> 01:40:31,988
Talkin' 'bout you...
you in control.

1332
01:40:31,990 --> 01:40:34,224
You ain't no more in control
than the man in the moon.

1333
01:40:35,192 --> 01:40:37,629
You're a bigger coward
than I thought you was.

1334
01:41:02,755 --> 01:41:04,757
<i>The five o'clock news hour.</i>

1335
01:41:05,091 --> 01:41:09,592
<i>With the highly anticipated charrette
vote just a few hours away now,</i>

1336
01:41:09,594 --> 01:41:12,562
<i>we caught up
with WDNC's Ken Meadows,</i>

1337
01:41:12,564 --> 01:41:14,731
<i>who was with some students</i>

1338
01:41:14,733 --> 01:41:17,369
<i>gathered outside the
charrette site earlier today.</i>

1339
01:41:17,769 --> 01:41:19,268
<i>Do you think
it's gonna be okay?</i>

1340
01:41:19,270 --> 01:41:20,739
<i>Well, it might be all right.</i>

1341
01:41:22,207 --> 01:41:24,040
<i>I think the same thing too.</i>

1342
01:41:24,042 --> 01:41:25,975
- <i>Uh-uh. I don't.</i>
- <i>Why not?</i>

1343
01:41:25,977 --> 01:41:29,980
<i>I don't. Because, see,
our first day that I went out there</i>

1344
01:41:29,982 --> 01:41:31,816
<i>where we had to scramble,
you know.</i>

1345
01:41:32,217 --> 01:41:33,618
<i>But it was okay.</i>

1346
01:41:34,653 --> 01:41:37,788
<i>It doesn't matter what school
you go to, it's gonna be the same.</i>

1347
01:41:37,790 --> 01:41:39,659
<i>You get your education
just the same.</i>

1348
01:41:40,458 --> 01:41:43,929
<i>I'm fixin' to enroll now,
and it'll be my school.</i>

1349
01:41:45,330 --> 01:41:47,898
<i>Are you concerned for
your daughter, or is she concerned?</i>

1350
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:49,500
<i>Well, I'm concerned for her,</i>

1351
01:41:49,502 --> 01:41:52,004
<i>and I think she's concerned
for her education.</i>

1352
01:41:52,938 --> 01:41:54,937
<i>Laverne,
I just talked to your mother.</i>

1353
01:41:54,939 --> 01:41:56,939
<i>She said you're a little concerned.
Are you?</i>

1354
01:41:56,941 --> 01:41:59,177
- <i>I'm very much concerned.</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

1355
01:41:59,811 --> 01:42:03,513
<i>Oh, because I wanna...
I wanna be very sure about this year,</i>

1356
01:42:03,515 --> 01:42:06,719
<i>and I want to really know
what they're doing, and...</i>

1357
01:42:07,452 --> 01:42:12,056
<i>I think that it will work out if
everybody cooperates together.</i>

1358
01:42:12,058 --> 01:42:15,959
<i>Because, I mean, this is not
the, probably, first time...</i>

1359
01:43:50,257 --> 01:43:53,059
- You did great work, Ann.
- No.

1360
01:43:53,527 --> 01:43:56,961
The one thing those people came here
for, we didn't get it for 'em.

1361
01:43:56,963 --> 01:43:59,332
Not true.
Some of them will be delighted.

1362
01:44:02,502 --> 01:44:05,305
You know, I never really
thought you was an Uncle Tom.

1363
01:44:06,339 --> 01:44:07,541
Yes, you did.

1364
01:44:11,746 --> 01:44:13,214
"Roughhouse Annie," huh?

1365
01:44:13,647 --> 01:44:15,183
Don't you forget it.

1366
01:44:24,157 --> 01:44:25,759
Welcome, welcome.

1367
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:36,503
Well, what a journey
it's been, folks.

1368
01:44:37,138 --> 01:44:40,174
You've all shown such
dedication these past two weeks.

1369
01:44:40,473 --> 01:44:43,978
And regardless of the outcome,
you should be proud.

1370
01:44:51,185 --> 01:44:54,320
The resolution you've put
before this senate is clear,

1371
01:44:54,322 --> 01:44:58,059
it is thoughtful,
and above all, it is brave.

1372
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:00,828
This resolution is
in three parts.

1373
01:45:01,395 --> 01:45:03,296
After I read out each one,

1374
01:45:03,298 --> 01:45:05,699
I will call the senate members
up to cast their votes.

1375
01:45:06,466 --> 01:45:10,169
Each part requires
a two-thirds majority to pass.

1376
01:45:10,171 --> 01:45:11,873
That's eight votes.

1377
01:45:13,406 --> 01:45:14,541
Part one.

1378
01:45:15,542 --> 01:45:18,010
Two students,
one black, one white,

1379
01:45:18,012 --> 01:45:21,883
to be appointed every year
to the Durham school board.

1380
01:45:22,183 --> 01:45:24,185
I vote yes.

1381
01:45:27,688 --> 01:45:28,856
Mr. Watford.

1382
01:45:30,625 --> 01:45:31,826
I'm a no.

1383
01:45:33,995 --> 01:45:35,694
I vote yes.

1384
01:45:35,696 --> 01:45:38,166
Part one passes
with eight votes.

1385
01:45:41,203 --> 01:45:46,840
Part two. This calls that summer classes
be included in the school board budget

1386
01:45:46,842 --> 01:45:49,910
so the black students become
level with their white peers.

1387
01:45:49,912 --> 01:45:51,046
Mr. Weeks.

1388
01:45:52,748 --> 01:45:55,047
I vote no.

1389
01:45:55,049 --> 01:45:56,117
Mr. Cox.

1390
01:45:57,151 --> 01:45:58,286
I vote yes.

1391
01:46:00,688 --> 01:46:01,756
I vote yes.

1392
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:07,793
Part two passes
with eight votes.

1393
01:46:19,473 --> 01:46:20,642
Part three.

1394
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:26,481
Public school integration.

1395
01:46:28,050 --> 01:46:29,184
In summary,

1396
01:46:30,085 --> 01:46:32,953
this calls for full
and immediate integration

1397
01:46:32,955 --> 01:46:35,891
starting in the fall semester
of this school year.

1398
01:46:36,758 --> 01:46:40,760
The resolution defines full
integration by setting a race ratio

1399
01:46:40,762 --> 01:46:45,599
of no less than 25 percent
of any race at each school.

1400
01:46:46,401 --> 01:46:49,869
And further, that busing be
made available to students

1401
01:46:49,871 --> 01:46:53,175
to aid in the implementation
of this ratio.

1402
01:46:55,577 --> 01:46:58,313
We'll start the vote
on this side with Miss Wilson.

1403
01:47:07,990 --> 01:47:09,825
I vote yes.

1404
01:47:15,365 --> 01:47:16,466
Mr. Watford?

1405
01:47:23,006 --> 01:47:24,105
I vote no.

1406
01:47:28,378 --> 01:47:30,045
Mr. Mose.

1407
01:47:34,317 --> 01:47:35,949
I vote yes.

1408
01:47:40,822 --> 01:47:41,990
Mr. Weeks.

1409
01:47:46,496 --> 01:47:49,696
I vote "hell no."

1410
01:47:55,938 --> 01:47:57,206
Mr. Cox?

1411
01:48:02,111 --> 01:48:03,744
I vote "hell yes."

1412
01:48:12,189 --> 01:48:13,357
Mr. Trombley.

1413
01:48:24,599 --> 01:48:26,135
Thank you, Mr. Riddick.

1414
01:48:33,410 --> 01:48:36,344
I believe in school
integration, and I vote yes.

1415
01:48:41,318 --> 01:48:42,752
It's not gonna matter.

1416
01:48:49,692 --> 01:48:50,793
Reverend.

1417
01:48:53,730 --> 01:48:59,636
With the good Lord as my
guide, I proudly vote yes.

1418
01:49:03,674 --> 01:49:04,808
Miss Mays.

1419
01:49:23,293 --> 01:49:27,998
Although I think it should be
considered in the future, I...

1420
01:49:31,268 --> 01:49:34,439
I don't believe right now
is the time for integration.

1421
01:49:35,906 --> 01:49:37,841
Respectfully, I vote no.

1422
01:49:39,611 --> 01:49:41,778
Hey.

1423
01:50:11,543 --> 01:50:12,676
Mr. Clement.

1424
01:50:17,848 --> 01:50:22,952
I am honored to have had the
chance to get to know most of you

1425
01:50:22,954 --> 01:50:24,923
these past few weeks,

1426
01:50:25,323 --> 01:50:28,259
to work on these vital issues.

1427
01:50:28,693 --> 01:50:32,931
And while I fear
that my vote will be in vain,

1428
01:50:33,666 --> 01:50:35,233
I'm still gonna vote.

1429
01:50:36,067 --> 01:50:38,903
And I vote yes
on school integration.

1430
01:50:44,542 --> 01:50:45,577
Mr. Keith.

1431
01:50:52,050 --> 01:50:53,084
No.

1432
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:03,696
Miss Atwater.

1433
01:51:32,123 --> 01:51:33,157
Yes.

1434
01:51:40,633 --> 01:51:42,468
Looks like
we finally shut her up.

1435
01:51:44,503 --> 01:51:45,770
Mr. Ellis.

1436
01:51:46,605 --> 01:51:48,106
All right.

1437
01:51:48,674 --> 01:51:49,907
All right.

1438
01:51:53,212 --> 01:51:54,280
All right.

1439
01:51:55,381 --> 01:51:56,415
Thank you.

1440
01:51:57,049 --> 01:51:58,115
Thank you.

1441
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:02,154
I-I-I...

1442
01:52:07,727 --> 01:52:11,330
Uh...

1443
01:52:12,465 --> 01:52:14,766
I guess I'd first echo
what Mr. Clement said.

1444
01:52:14,768 --> 01:52:16,670
It was good to get to know
some of you, and I...

1445
01:52:17,802 --> 01:52:21,507
I know many of you will be
disappointed with our outcome here.

1446
01:52:22,675 --> 01:52:23,709
I, uh...

1447
01:52:38,157 --> 01:52:40,059
You know, before I go on...

1448
01:52:41,461 --> 01:52:43,329
...I'd like to show you all
something.

1449
01:52:45,964 --> 01:52:48,399
- This is my Klan membership card.
- All right.

1450
01:52:50,303 --> 01:52:53,506
I was given this card
12 years ago.

1451
01:52:54,741 --> 01:52:56,842
It's been in my wallet
ever since.

1452
01:52:57,577 --> 01:52:59,644
In fact, I cried
when they gave me this card.

1453
01:52:59,646 --> 01:53:02,682
And I grew up in a house where
I was taught men don't cry.

1454
01:53:03,450 --> 01:53:04,951
But I cried anyway.

1455
01:53:05,918 --> 01:53:09,556
I cried because it was the first
time in my life I didn't feel alone.

1456
01:53:12,659 --> 01:53:14,826
Sure, I was married
with a family.

1457
01:53:14,828 --> 01:53:17,462
That's not the kind of alone
I'm talking about.

1458
01:53:17,464 --> 01:53:19,865
As a man, you're expected
to take care of that family.

1459
01:53:21,201 --> 01:53:23,236
And I was havin' a hard time
doin' that.

1460
01:53:23,969 --> 01:53:27,607
We were struggling.
So...

1461
01:53:28,842 --> 01:53:31,175
There I was.
I was a part of something now.

1462
01:53:31,177 --> 01:53:34,614
Something much,
much bigger than me.

1463
01:53:36,483 --> 01:53:39,519
And then when they made me
president, boy, I was over the moon.

1464
01:53:40,855 --> 01:53:43,123
Poor old C.P. Ellis
president of something.

1465
01:53:44,759 --> 01:53:46,394
Whoa.

1466
01:53:54,467 --> 01:53:56,536
And it's a real brotherhood.
It is.

1467
01:53:56,836 --> 01:53:59,105
In the Klan,
you look out for one another.

1468
01:53:59,539 --> 01:54:02,675
Nobody is left behind.
Everybody does for everybody else.

1469
01:54:03,376 --> 01:54:05,209
In fact, it says it right
here on this card...

1470
01:54:05,211 --> 01:54:08,915
It says
<i>"Non silba, sed anthar."</i>

1471
01:54:10,049 --> 01:54:12,919
Which means "Not for
oneself, but for others."

1472
01:54:13,721 --> 01:54:15,088
That's our motto.

1473
01:54:18,592 --> 01:54:20,260
But see, now I got a problem.

1474
01:54:21,562 --> 01:54:22,663
There's a problem...

1475
01:54:24,465 --> 01:54:26,765
'cause there's a lot of that going
around right here in this room.

1476
01:54:26,767 --> 01:54:28,102
People doin' for others.

1477
01:54:29,904 --> 01:54:32,273
Last two weeks have been
full of people just do...

1478
01:54:33,140 --> 01:54:34,341
doing for others.

1479
01:54:35,476 --> 01:54:37,911
And they're not just white people.
There's a...

1480
01:54:37,913 --> 01:54:40,247
There's a lot of black folk
doing for others too.

1481
01:54:41,615 --> 01:54:43,314
But I'm the president
of the Klan.

1482
01:54:43,316 --> 01:54:44,917
I'm supposed to hate
black folk.

1483
01:54:44,919 --> 01:54:48,121
I teach people
to hate black folk.

1484
01:54:50,056 --> 01:54:52,426
They're supposed to be
inferior to us.

1485
01:54:55,094 --> 01:54:56,831
Now, if I don't believe that,

1486
01:54:57,398 --> 01:55:00,434
then I have no business being
president of the Klan.

1487
01:55:06,106 --> 01:55:07,408
Well, I don't believe it.

1488
01:55:10,779 --> 01:55:12,179
So my problem is...

1489
01:55:13,414 --> 01:55:15,316
I don't have no need
for this anymore.

1490
01:55:30,664 --> 01:55:32,431
Mr. Riddick, I vote yes.

1491
01:55:32,433 --> 01:55:33,499
Jesus!

1492
01:55:50,351 --> 01:55:51,953
I just don't believe it.

1493
01:56:01,463 --> 01:56:02,631
C.P.?

1494
01:56:06,034 --> 01:56:07,135
C.P.?

1495
01:56:46,943 --> 01:56:48,044
Yeah?

1496
01:57:13,736 --> 01:57:14,870
Where's the key?

1497
01:57:15,236 --> 01:57:17,039
- Jeb!
- Where's the key?

1498
01:57:20,776 --> 01:57:22,310
Call the fire department!

1499
01:57:29,919 --> 01:57:32,021
Come on.

1500
01:58:20,469 --> 01:58:21,672
Thank you.

1501
01:58:22,338 --> 01:58:25,942
Next on the agenda is delivery
of the charrette resolution.

1502
01:58:26,476 --> 01:58:29,479
The council recognizes
Miss Atwater.

1503
01:58:59,676 --> 01:59:01,445
Yeah. Hello?

1504
01:59:56,734 --> 01:59:58,136
Okay, Mr. Ellis.

1505
02:00:00,270 --> 02:00:01,405
How many?

1506
02:00:01,773 --> 02:00:04,609
Well, you lost
about 650 gallons.

1507
02:00:05,343 --> 02:00:07,044
You're lucky
the thing didn't explode.

1508
02:00:07,578 --> 02:00:09,080
Yeah, okay.

1509
02:00:09,580 --> 02:00:13,218
You want to replace the loss?
I can have a truck here tomorrow.

1510
02:00:15,753 --> 02:00:17,887
No. Let's see how
the rest of the month goes.

1511
02:00:17,889 --> 02:00:18,956
All right.

1512
02:00:20,290 --> 02:00:22,794
- What's this?
- Would you sign both pages?

1513
02:00:45,150 --> 02:00:46,285
Thank you, Mr. Ellis.

1514
02:00:47,019 --> 02:00:48,519
Change your mind,
give us a call.

1515
02:01:11,243 --> 02:01:12,977
- Mr. Ellis.
- Mm-hmm?

1516
02:01:14,512 --> 02:01:16,514
If you need to let me go,
it's okay.

1517
02:01:17,182 --> 02:01:19,284
You know,
until things pick up again.

1518
02:01:20,818 --> 02:01:23,688
I appreciate that, Jeb.
But we're not there yet, okay?

1519
02:01:24,122 --> 02:01:26,725
So for now, go ahead,
take your lunch break.

1520
02:01:27,860 --> 02:01:29,493
Okay, Mr. Ellis.

1521
02:01:30,262 --> 02:01:31,330
All right.

1522
02:01:57,689 --> 02:02:01,523
I hope you didn't come here to
ask me to co-chair somethin' else.

1523
02:02:01,525 --> 02:02:04,327
Nah. I just came
to say good-bye is all.

1524
02:02:04,329 --> 02:02:07,099
- Back to Raleigh, huh?
- Back to Raleigh.

1525
02:02:15,241 --> 02:02:16,840
What trouble you been causin'?

1526
02:02:16,842 --> 02:02:19,444
Just organizing, you know me.

1527
02:02:20,146 --> 02:02:22,547
- It's what you do, right?
- It's just what I do.

1528
02:02:22,916 --> 02:02:24,648
I sure wish
you coulda been there

1529
02:02:24,650 --> 02:02:27,218
when we handed in
our resolution. Mmm.

1530
02:02:27,220 --> 02:02:29,454
Old Carvie Oldham
didn't even show up.

1531
02:02:32,558 --> 02:02:34,027
Wish I'd seen that.

1532
02:02:34,527 --> 02:02:35,895
How are you doin', C.P.?

1533
02:02:36,763 --> 02:02:38,598
Oh, had a little trouble here.

1534
02:02:39,766 --> 02:02:41,731
Just trying to
put it back together.

1535
02:02:41,733 --> 02:02:43,101
Yeah, we heard.

1536
02:02:44,136 --> 02:02:45,902
I'm so sorry, C.P.

1537
02:02:45,904 --> 02:02:48,774
It's okay.
Although not sure it matters much.

1538
02:02:49,541 --> 02:02:52,742
Nobody stoppin' to buy gas
from me these days.

1539
02:02:55,048 --> 02:02:58,450
Well... Maybe things
will pick up for you.

1540
02:03:00,219 --> 02:03:01,788
What you smilin' at?

1541
02:03:33,820 --> 02:03:35,922
That's just what I do, C.P.

1542
02:03:36,289 --> 02:03:38,558
You know that.
That's just what I do.

1543
02:03:55,476 --> 02:03:58,578
Hey, Jeb. We got customers.

1544
02:04:02,816 --> 02:04:05,486
Gas?

1545
02:04:05,853 --> 02:04:07,486
- Gas?
- All right, sir.

1546
02:04:07,488 --> 02:04:09,054
You want gas?

1547
02:04:09,056 --> 02:04:10,858
- Yeah, no problem.
- All right.

1548
02:04:29,343 --> 02:04:33,311
She can upset the world with
her mouth if she wants to.

1549
02:04:33,313 --> 02:04:36,281
But everywhere I go,
every time I pick up a newspaper,

1550
02:04:36,283 --> 02:04:39,618
Ann Atwater's been before the
council, the county commission,

1551
02:04:39,620 --> 02:04:42,020
or she was at some
shopping center boycotting,

1552
02:04:42,022 --> 02:04:43,791
or she was downtown
at Woolworths.

1553
02:04:44,359 --> 02:04:46,325
And he was woofin'
and goin' on,

1554
02:04:46,327 --> 02:04:48,428
and the place was packed
with Klansmen.

1555
02:04:48,430 --> 02:04:51,932
This particular night, C.P.
was up raging and ranting.

1556
02:04:52,534 --> 02:04:54,601
That's when
I wanted to cut his head off.

1557
02:04:54,868 --> 02:04:56,835
And after that first meeting,

1558
02:04:56,837 --> 02:04:59,340
I actually went home saying,
this is crazy.

1559
02:04:59,640 --> 02:05:03,543
This is absolutely crazy.
I don't think I wanna do this.

1560
02:05:03,545 --> 02:05:06,413
I mean, I can make a living
easier than this.

1561
02:05:13,587 --> 02:05:16,524
The story was picked up
in <i>The Washington Post.</i>

1562
02:05:17,224 --> 02:05:19,793
"Black man calls Klansman
'brother.'"

1563
02:05:20,395 --> 02:05:24,532
And of course, my father, when he read
the story in <i>The Washington Post...</i>

1564
02:05:25,599 --> 02:05:27,469
he thought I had lost my mind.

1565
02:05:35,009 --> 02:05:40,882
In becoming my friend,
C.P. has lost a lot.

1566
02:05:41,216 --> 02:05:44,587
Look, you do not make those changes
without having to pay for 'em.

1567
02:05:44,986 --> 02:05:47,887
I know damn well, you know.

1568
02:05:47,889 --> 02:05:49,624
You have to pay for it
eventually.

1569
02:05:50,259 --> 02:05:52,924
We bonded,
and we are still bonding.

1570
02:05:52,926 --> 02:05:54,826
Until I get mad with him
at times.

1571
02:05:54,828 --> 02:05:58,730
But we've made it through these
years, together 30 years,

1572
02:05:58,732 --> 02:06:00,335
and we're still friends.

1573
02:06:21,624 --> 02:06:26,428
'Cause there are C.P. Ellises and Ann
Atwaters in almost every community.

1574
02:06:27,662 --> 02:06:29,532
They just need
to be brought together

1575
02:06:30,065 --> 02:06:33,636
and experience what we experienced
in Durham with that charrette.

1576
02:06:47,817 --> 02:06:50,783
