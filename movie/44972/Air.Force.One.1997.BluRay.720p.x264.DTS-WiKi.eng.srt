Demo set,

4
00:04:03,254 --> 00:04:04,551
Let's move,

5
00:04:17,869 --> 00:04:19,302
Clear,

6
00:04:36,654 --> 00:04:39,418
Low Boy, this is Black Cat,

7
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,254
ETA Romeo, L-Z-one-niner,

8
00:04:42,326 --> 00:04:43,884
We are hot, Copy,

9
00:04:47,198 --> 00:04:49,666
Come on, Get out there!
Go, go!

10
00:04:51,402 --> 00:04:52,630
Come on,

11
00:04:57,608 --> 00:04:58,540
Get in!

12
00:05:01,913 --> 00:05:03,710
Cover! I'm on the roof!

13
00:05:09,086 --> 00:05:09,984
Go!

14
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,924
This is Low Boy,
Package is wrapped,

15
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:39,748
Ladies and gentlemen,,,

16
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:44,754
three weeks ago,
Russian and American special forces,,,

17
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:47,824
apprehended the self-proclaimed leader
of Kazakhstan,,,

18
00:05:47,925 --> 00:05:50,257
General Ivan Radek,

19
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:02,261
His nuclear arsenal
could have brought the world,,,

20
00:06:04,475 --> 00:06:08,172
But thanks to the support of one
of the world's greatest leaders,,,

21
00:06:08,246 --> 00:06:11,545
Radek is now in prison,

22
00:06:15,386 --> 00:06:18,753
Today we are honoring this brave man,

23
00:06:19,991 --> 00:06:22,551
Ladies and gentlemen,
my friend,,,

24
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,061
the president of the United States
of America,

25
00:06:40,878 --> 00:06:44,678
The dead remember our indifference,

26
00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:47,115
The dead remember our silence,

27
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:49,550
I came here tonight
to be congratulated,

28
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:53,120
But today when I visited
the Red Cross camps,,,

29
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,523
overwhelmed by the flood of refugees,,,

30
00:06:56,594 --> 00:06:59,028
fleeing from the horror
of Kazakhstan,,,

31
00:06:59,997 --> 00:07:03,728
I realized I don't deserve
to be congratulated, none of us do,

32
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:06,201
- What's he doing?
- That's not the speech,

33
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,669
The truth is,,,

34
00:07:07,738 --> 00:07:10,138
we acted too late,

35
00:07:10,207 --> 00:07:14,701
Only when our own national security
was threatened did we act,

36
00:07:16,647 --> 00:07:20,845
Radek's regime murdered over 200,000
men, women and children,,,

37
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:22,852
and we watched it on TV,

38
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,048
We let it happen,
People were being slaughtered,,,

39
00:07:26,157 --> 00:07:28,421
for over a year,

40
00:07:28,492 --> 00:07:33,327
We issued economic sanctions and hid
behind the rhetoric of diplomacy,

41
00:07:33,397 --> 00:07:34,796
How dare we?

42
00:07:34,865 --> 00:07:37,129
The dead remember,

43
00:07:37,201 --> 00:07:38,600
Real peace,,,

44
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:43,572
is not just the absence of conflict,
it's the presence of justice,

45
00:07:45,343 --> 00:07:48,176
Tonight I come to you with a pledge
to change America's policy,

46
00:07:49,013 --> 00:07:50,446
Never again,,,

47
00:07:50,514 --> 00:07:54,177
will I allow
our political self-interest,,,

48
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:57,482
to deter us from doing what we know
to be morally right,

49
00:07:57,521 --> 00:08:00,957
Atrocity and terror
are not political weapons,

50
00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:03,026
And to those who would use them,,,

51
00:08:04,762 --> 00:08:06,730
your day is over,

52
00:08:08,299 --> 00:08:10,267
We will never negotiate,

53
00:08:11,736 --> 00:08:16,036
We will no longer tolerate
and we will no longer be afraid,

54
00:08:18,609 --> 00:08:21,169
It's your turn to be afraid,

55
00:08:56,714 --> 00:08:58,648
The Russian was a nice touch,

56
00:08:58,716 --> 00:09:01,116
Tell my mother,
She wanted me to study French,

57
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:06,020
- Do you know what you committed us to?
- I know exactly what I committed us to,

58
00:09:11,762 --> 00:09:14,663
Gentlemen,
welcome to "Air Force One,"

59
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:17,326
Please present your equipment
for inspection,

60
00:09:17,435 --> 00:09:19,801
We were just inspected at the gate,

61
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,338
This plane carries the president
of the United States,

62
00:09:22,406 --> 00:09:24,340
I understand, I'm terribly sorry,

63
00:09:26,277 --> 00:09:28,871
Please place your thumb
on the I, D, pad,

64
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:39,381
Access cleared,

65
00:09:55,506 --> 00:09:58,737
Hello, I'm Melanie Mitchell,
deputy press secretary,

66
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:01,209
- I'll be taking you in from here,
- Oh, Miss Mitchell,

67
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:03,542
It is so nice to finally meet you
in person,

68
00:10:03,614 --> 00:10:05,912
The president and I were delighted
we could accommodate your news crew,

69
00:10:05,983 --> 00:10:08,315
So, if you boys are all cleared?

70
00:10:08,385 --> 00:10:12,754
The president's on a very tight schedule
so this is how it works,

71
00:10:12,823 --> 00:10:14,757
During the flight,
two members of your crew,,,

72
00:10:14,825 --> 00:10:16,986
will be allowed outside the press area
for filming,

73
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:20,222
You'll get exactly 10 minutes
with the president, 20 with the crew,

74
00:10:26,203 --> 00:10:29,400
Gary, the president is ready
to take Congress on,

75
00:10:29,473 --> 00:10:31,202
He's not gonna kiss their ass
for each vote,

76
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:34,608
Let them vote us down
and stand on their record,

77
00:10:34,678 --> 00:10:37,010
Yeah, I'm with him now,
I'll call you from the plane,

78
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:40,517
- What did they say about the speech?
- Your speech is leading the news,

79
00:10:40,551 --> 00:10:42,519
They're calling it
the "Be Afraid" speech,

80
00:10:42,553 --> 00:10:43,986
Good,

81
00:10:44,054 --> 00:10:46,113
With all due respect,
next time you want to make,,,

82
00:10:46,257 --> 00:10:48,225
a major policy departure,
you might want to discuss it,,,

83
00:10:48,325 --> 00:10:50,088
with your national security advisor
first,

84
00:10:51,662 --> 00:10:53,926
- We did discuss it, Jack,
- We discussed it,,,

85
00:10:53,998 --> 00:10:56,432
in private, which is where I thought
it would remain,

86
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,435
Now it's public,
Now it's policy,

87
00:11:00,738 --> 00:11:02,205
Get behind it,

88
00:11:02,273 --> 00:11:05,037
The allies are going to be very upset
they weren't consulted about this,

89
00:11:05,109 --> 00:11:07,373
It might come back and bite us
in the ass in November,

90
00:11:07,444 --> 00:11:09,810
It's the right thing to do,

91
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,347
You know it,

92
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,118
There goes the neighborhood,

93
00:11:16,086 --> 00:11:18,953
If you'd like,
we have time for a quick tour,

94
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:20,991
- We'd be delighted,
- Good,

95
00:11:21,058 --> 00:11:22,685
Andrei, Boris,

96
00:11:22,793 --> 00:11:24,420
Follow me,

97
00:11:24,495 --> 00:11:27,828
Ahead of this staff cabin
is Secret Service, Right here,

98
00:11:27,898 --> 00:11:31,561
Never try to go past them without
an escort or you'll be very sorry,

99
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:33,796
- Hello,
- Hi,

100
00:11:33,904 --> 00:11:36,464
Thanks for the warning,

101
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,770
Here we have
our in-flight offices,

102
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:06,937
A lot of the plane's features
are classified,

103
00:12:07,004 --> 00:12:09,404
But I can tell you
it's bullet-resistant,,,

104
00:12:09,473 --> 00:12:13,034
and it's even protected against
the pulse of a nuclear blast,

105
00:12:13,143 --> 00:12:15,270
I'm not sure that's very comforting,

106
00:12:16,647 --> 00:12:20,606
Upstairs is the cockpit along with the
most advanced communications center,,,

107
00:12:20,718 --> 00:12:23,312
on or above the face of the earth,

108
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,217
We could run the whole country
from here,

109
00:12:25,322 --> 00:12:27,381
Or even a war if we had to,

110
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:30,426
Just last week, the president called
the shuttle astronauts from there,

111
00:12:31,161 --> 00:12:33,686
The president's arriving,
They should take their seats,

112
00:12:33,797 --> 00:12:35,230
Right away,

113
00:12:35,332 --> 00:12:37,892
I'll get out of here and let you all
get some sleep,

114
00:12:52,383 --> 00:12:55,819
- Mr, President, welcome aboard,
- Hey, Danny, How are you?

115
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,386
Mr, President!

116
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:02,116
Change in plan, Danny,
Let's go to Barbados,

117
00:13:02,226 --> 00:13:04,091
Anything you want,
You're the president,

118
00:13:04,161 --> 00:13:05,719
Boy, I wish,

119
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:08,093
- Mr, President,
- Mr, Gibbs, where's my bunch?

120
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:10,429
Ballet ran late,
They'll be here in five minutes,

121
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:13,561
- Lewis, you tape the game?
- It was a real squeaker, sir,

122
00:13:13,671 --> 00:13:16,970
Don't brief me on it,
I wanted to watch it, for Christ's sake,

123
00:13:17,975 --> 00:13:19,806
We'll be underway
in about 30 minutes, sir,

124
00:13:19,877 --> 00:13:21,845
Mr, President,

125
00:13:21,912 --> 00:13:24,403
Could you put the game on now?
Yeah, Jack?

126
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:26,540
The Iraqis have mobilized
two armored brigades toward...

127
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,086
Just got it, Give me 15 minutes,
Get the guys together,

128
00:13:31,055 --> 00:13:33,455
"Repel them,
Make them relinquish the ball,"

129
00:13:33,524 --> 00:13:36,391
- Did you hear about Notre Dame?
- Don't, Don't tell me the score,

130
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,291
- Great game,
- Mr, President,

131
00:13:38,395 --> 00:13:40,795
We need to strategize,
smooth some things out politically,

132
00:13:40,864 --> 00:13:42,798
- What was that?
- It's not so important,

133
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:45,357
- Damage control, What if...
- Give me a minute alone,

134
00:13:45,436 --> 00:13:47,870
What if a "high-ranking
White House official"...

135
00:13:47,938 --> 00:13:49,872
Just give me a few moments alone,

136
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,875
A "high-ranking official" were
to qualify what you said last night?

137
00:13:52,943 --> 00:13:55,377
Drop it, Do yourself a favor,

138
00:13:55,446 --> 00:13:57,073
It's policy,
Drop it,

139
00:14:00,284 --> 00:14:02,752
I told them you'd give them a sound bite
about life in the White House,

140
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,583
There is no life in the White House,

141
00:14:04,655 --> 00:14:07,954
You said it,
The president needs some time alone,

142
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:11,692
14-13 Michigan!

143
00:14:11,762 --> 00:14:14,094
All right, Mr, President!

144
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:19,727
That wasn't you napping
during the performance, was it, Tom?

145
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:22,305
No, ma'am, It was very enjoyable,

146
00:14:22,406 --> 00:14:25,603
Alice, you can finish it on the plane,
Let's not keep your father waiting,

147
00:14:26,543 --> 00:14:28,909
Try and smile, sweetheart, Okay?

148
00:14:28,979 --> 00:14:32,506
- Alice, one picture, please!
- Thank you very much,

149
00:14:41,492 --> 00:14:43,983
Great, something from Tom,

150
00:14:44,094 --> 00:14:46,028
Shh, Daddy's asleep,

151
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:51,667
How was the ballet?

152
00:14:52,536 --> 00:14:54,094
It was great!

153
00:14:55,739 --> 00:14:59,140
You trying to kill me?
Wait it really good? Did you enjoy it?

154
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:02,042
Did you love it? Men in tights?
Did you hear my speech?

155
00:15:02,112 --> 00:15:04,137
- Yeah,
- Yeah?

156
00:15:04,248 --> 00:15:07,615
- You're gonna get yourself reelected,
- That's what I keep telling them,

157
00:15:13,323 --> 00:15:16,292
This is the aircraft commander,
We'll take to the runway in a moment,

158
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,386
- Are you guys comfortable?
- Yes, very,

159
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:23,999
You're welcome,

160
00:15:36,914 --> 00:15:39,075
Pass interference,
That's cheating,

161
00:15:39,183 --> 00:15:42,152
- Only if they get caught,
- Dad!

162
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:44,187
The way of the world, kiddo,

163
00:15:49,326 --> 00:15:52,591
Why didn't you take me with you
when you went to the refugee camp today?

164
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,529
For one thing,
it's not 100 percent secure,

165
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,836
Come on, Dad, It's not like
I don't see it on the news,

166
00:16:09,947 --> 00:16:11,881
It's different on the news,

167
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:15,715
All I'm saying is I'm ready for things
you don't think I'm ready for,

168
00:16:15,786 --> 00:16:17,879
Maybe I'm not ready,

169
00:16:17,988 --> 00:16:21,048
I'm 12 years old, Dad!
In the caveman days,,,

170
00:16:21,158 --> 00:16:23,422
I'd be having children of my own,

171
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:27,496
That's what we call progress, You're
missing the best part of the game,

172
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:30,166
God!

173
00:16:32,436 --> 00:16:35,530
We're so looking forward to seeing you,

174
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:40,769
- She is so anxious to grow up,
- I know, She's...

175
00:16:40,878 --> 00:16:43,005
Yes, the both of us,

176
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:45,172
Okay, Bye, bye,

177
00:16:47,117 --> 00:16:50,450
Well, she couldn't stay
your little girl forever, Jim,

178
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:54,014
I was hoping it would last
till she was 14 or 15,

179
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:56,792
Or 50,

180
00:16:58,729 --> 00:17:01,289
They hated your speech, didn't they?

181
00:17:01,398 --> 00:17:03,866
They're afraid we won't have the guts
to back it up,

182
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:06,902
And, then, if we do,
it'll be political suicide,

183
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,564
Remember our first campaign?

184
00:17:09,673 --> 00:17:11,607
- In the House?
- Yeah,

185
00:17:11,675 --> 00:17:15,076
- Downstate, driving around with...
- Who was that kid, our volunteer?

186
00:17:15,145 --> 00:17:17,613
- Henry,
- Henry with the convertible,

187
00:17:17,714 --> 00:17:20,274
- With the broken top,
- And the snow coming in,

188
00:17:20,384 --> 00:17:23,478
We were the only three people
who thought you could win that,

189
00:17:23,587 --> 00:17:27,148
You didn't give a damn, You knew
what needed to be done and you did it,

190
00:17:28,158 --> 00:17:31,389
And you spoke from your heart,
That's what I heard tonight,

191
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:36,229
Well, it felt good,

192
00:17:37,668 --> 00:17:39,636
I'll bet it did,

193
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,543
Sorry to interrupt,
Everybody's assembled, sir,

194
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:57,883
United States "Air Force One,"

195
00:17:57,955 --> 00:18:02,289
It is an honor to clear you
for immediate takeoff on runway 2-5,

196
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:04,486
"Air Force One" cleared for takeoff,

197
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:06,620
Thank you for your hospitality, Moscow,

198
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:03,110
In Moscow tonight,
President Marshall defended,,,

199
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,518
the military action
against the Radek regime,,,

200
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:09,025
an act the administration had
been calling a one-time intervention,

201
00:19:09,092 --> 00:19:11,026
But in a rare display of emotion,,,

202
00:19:11,094 --> 00:19:14,860
the president alluded to a change
in U, S, foreign policy when he stated,,,

203
00:19:14,931 --> 00:19:18,367
that America will no longer tolerate
any terrorist government,

204
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:25,372
These are two of Saddam Hussein's
Republican Guard brigades,,,

205
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:29,445
He knows we're watching,
knows we'll retaliate,

206
00:19:29,513 --> 00:19:31,777
Why the hell is he sending tanks
to the border?

207
00:19:31,848 --> 00:19:34,612
Could be a response to your speech,
Mr, President,

208
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:36,743
- Maybe he's got a son-in-law up there,
- Very funny,

209
00:19:36,853 --> 00:19:39,447
I think there's one or two
he hasn't shot yet,

210
00:19:39,523 --> 00:19:41,491
What does State have to say?

211
00:19:41,591 --> 00:19:43,752
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming
it's just an exercise,

212
00:19:44,995 --> 00:19:47,555
Let's not waste more time,
Send the "Nimitz" back in,

213
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:54,603
- Gibbs,
- Guys,

214
00:20:04,214 --> 00:20:05,977
- Sleeping on the job?
- No, sir,

215
00:20:21,131 --> 00:20:22,621
Hey, guys,,,

216
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,031
- Take a look at them,
- Thank you,

217
00:21:27,664 --> 00:21:29,598
Steward, there's smoke in the cabin,

218
00:21:31,034 --> 00:21:33,662
Everybody move to the back of the plane,
Now! Please!

219
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:36,364
Smoke! Notify the cockpit!

220
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:51,378
Mr, President, stay back,

221
00:21:55,992 --> 00:21:57,323
Everybody down!

222
00:22:08,004 --> 00:22:11,633
Code red! We have a code red!
I repeat, Shots fired on board,

223
00:22:11,741 --> 00:22:14,642
Code red acknowledged,
Lock that door now,

224
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:17,009
Flight control, this is "Air Force One"
declaring emergency,

225
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:20,305
Cover us!

226
00:22:20,383 --> 00:22:21,816
Stay back,

227
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:26,352
Move up!
I'll cover you,

228
00:22:26,957 --> 00:22:28,481
Go! Go!

229
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:31,393
- What's going on?
- Shots fired, sir,

230
00:22:31,461 --> 00:22:34,157
- What about my family?
- We're handling it, sir,

231
00:22:34,264 --> 00:22:36,596
Boy Scout coming out!
Cover!

232
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,429
- Give us cover!
- Daddy?

233
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:39,991
Alice, get back!

234
00:22:40,837 --> 00:22:44,034
Alice, get down!

235
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,631
- Take him around here,
- Get down,

236
00:22:46,743 --> 00:22:48,176
This is "Air Force One,"

237
00:22:48,245 --> 00:22:50,839
We are code red,
Shots fired on board,

238
00:22:50,981 --> 00:22:53,779
Request emergency assistance,
ETA 15 minutes,

239
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:57,616
Acknowledged, We are scrambling
our fighters, Emergency equipment,,,

240
00:22:57,687 --> 00:22:59,712
will be standing by,

241
00:23:09,699 --> 00:23:11,496
Get him to the escape pod!

242
00:23:11,568 --> 00:23:13,399
Boy Scout is headed to the vault,

243
00:23:14,137 --> 00:23:16,298
The football!
The football!

244
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,600
Get him around here,

245
00:23:22,512 --> 00:23:24,446
Get him down to the pod!

246
00:23:25,582 --> 00:23:27,049
Don't move!

247
00:23:32,656 --> 00:23:34,556
- They're on us,
- Where's my family?

248
00:23:34,624 --> 00:23:37,115
- Get in the pod, sir, Get in!
- What about my family?

249
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:48,335
"Air Force One," landing runway 0-9,
I repeat, runway 0-9,

250
00:23:48,405 --> 00:23:51,897
Roger, Turning to heading 1-8-5,
Descending to 5,000 feet,

251
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,508
Ramstein, this is "Air Force One,"

252
00:24:25,542 --> 00:24:29,273
Emergency pod has been deployed,
I repeat,

253
00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:32,041
- The emergency pod has been deployed,
- Ramstein tower, acknowledge,

254
00:24:32,148 --> 00:24:34,776
We are picking up the homing beacon
and deploying search and rescue,

255
00:24:41,157 --> 00:24:44,058
- Is the locking ready to look at?
- Just about, sir,

256
00:24:44,127 --> 00:24:46,561
- Has General Northwood arrived?
- Yes, he has,

257
00:24:48,898 --> 00:24:51,366
- Give me an update,
- Madam Vice President, this way,

258
00:24:51,434 --> 00:24:53,800
- We'll avoid the press,
- Is the president secure?

259
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,929
Not yet, The recovery team
will have him very soon,

260
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,814
"Air Force One",,,

261
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,354
this is Halo Flight Lead,
you are under escort,

262
00:25:13,423 --> 00:25:16,756
All airspace has been cleared,
Alert force has been mobilized,

263
00:25:16,826 --> 00:25:18,794
- Is everyone here?
- We're working on it,

264
00:25:18,862 --> 00:25:21,695
How did this happen?
How did they get "Air Force One"?

265
00:25:21,765 --> 00:25:24,097
Gentlemen, Mr, Secretary,

266
00:25:26,503 --> 00:25:28,095
Ramstein tower, we are at ten mile...

267
00:25:28,204 --> 00:25:30,468
Final coming in red hot,

268
00:25:30,507 --> 00:25:35,001
Roger, "Air Force One," Wind is
0-niner-0 at 1-2, You are clear to land,

269
00:25:47,657 --> 00:25:49,591
Get down! Now!

270
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,730
Open the door!

271
00:26:08,178 --> 00:26:10,510
Open!
Open the door!

272
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,913
No matter what happens, we land
this aircraft, Is that understood?

273
00:26:16,352 --> 00:26:18,684
Come on, Flaps 30,

274
00:26:18,755 --> 00:26:20,552
Flaps 30,

275
00:26:52,055 --> 00:26:54,023
- No!
- Get the fuck in the air!

276
00:26:59,229 --> 00:27:01,254
Now!
Take this plane up!

277
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:04,698
Up! Up!

278
00:27:11,207 --> 00:27:13,300
Take it up!

279
00:27:13,409 --> 00:27:16,310
Get this plane back in the air now
or you die,

280
00:27:18,181 --> 00:27:20,115
Get up now!

281
00:27:49,245 --> 00:27:50,906
No! Jesus!

282
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,177
Contact those F-15s,

283
00:28:59,282 --> 00:29:02,342
I want them to keep "Air Force One"
in visual contact,

284
00:29:02,452 --> 00:29:05,478
- What are our airborne scenarios?
- There are no airborne scenarios,

285
00:29:05,555 --> 00:29:09,218
Then we'd better start generating them,
They better be good and better work,

286
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:11,293
How long can they stay up there
with the fuel they have?

287
00:29:11,361 --> 00:29:13,829
- That's a question of airspeed, wind,
- Altitude,

288
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:17,525
We need an "Air Force One" pilot, Any
educated guesses where they might go?

289
00:29:17,634 --> 00:29:20,797
- Iraq, Libya, Algeria,
- Those are guesses, but not educated,

290
00:29:20,903 --> 00:29:23,167
Notify our allies,
We'll need secure airspace,

291
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:25,173
- Can we keep that under wraps?
- We'll do our best,

292
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:28,904
Try and relax, Kathryn,
I'm in charge here,

293
00:29:29,012 --> 00:29:31,674
I don't know,
It seems to me they're in charge,

294
00:29:48,831 --> 00:29:51,061
- Don't hurt me,
- Go,

295
00:29:51,134 --> 00:29:52,567
Go,

296
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:23,192
Moscow police found six members
of a Russian TV news crew murdered,

297
00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:29,032
Tell me it's not that easy,

298
00:30:29,138 --> 00:30:31,800
No, You would have to generate
fake I, D,, photos,

299
00:30:31,908 --> 00:30:34,172
- Fingerprints,
- Could be with help from Moscow,

300
00:30:34,243 --> 00:30:35,972
How would they get weapons on board?

301
00:30:36,045 --> 00:30:38,843
There's no way to get weapons on board
"Air Force One," It's impossible,

302
00:30:38,915 --> 00:30:42,316
There are enough weapons on board to
take Panama, but who has access to them?

303
00:30:42,418 --> 00:30:44,147
You think someone on the plane
helped them?

304
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,916
What if somebody did
and they're still on the plane?

305
00:30:47,023 --> 00:30:50,049
Who do they trust up there?
Who do we trust?

306
00:30:51,994 --> 00:30:55,259
Madam Vice President,
Mr, Secretary,

307
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:57,697
All compromised nuclear launch codes
have been cancelled,

308
00:30:57,767 --> 00:30:59,735
New codes are active,

309
00:30:59,836 --> 00:31:04,170
Ramstein, the president's escape pod
has been located,

310
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,765
We're honing in at 2-8-5 degrees,

311
00:31:11,214 --> 00:31:14,149
There it is,
Ramstein, we have a strong signal,

312
00:31:15,618 --> 00:31:17,745
ETA, two minutes,

313
00:31:26,496 --> 00:31:28,964
Where is the wife and daughter?

314
00:31:41,711 --> 00:31:43,645
Where is my husband?

315
00:31:46,015 --> 00:31:49,849
He had fled,
The coward chose to save himself,

316
00:31:52,288 --> 00:31:56,088
But one can always
strike a bargain,

317
00:31:57,093 --> 00:31:59,687
You listen to me,

318
00:31:59,796 --> 00:32:03,163
I don't know who you are
or what you want,,,

319
00:32:03,232 --> 00:32:05,792
but you will never get it,

320
00:32:06,636 --> 00:32:09,196
He will not negotiate,

321
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:12,406
Really?

322
00:32:13,276 --> 00:32:16,245
His wife, His daughter,

323
00:32:17,246 --> 00:32:20,682
A man could not live with himself,

324
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,846
And it would be such bad politics,

325
00:32:31,394 --> 00:32:33,692
I think he'll negotiate,

326
00:32:45,408 --> 00:32:47,774
The escape pod is visually acquired,

327
00:32:47,844 --> 00:32:50,972
Location of Ramstein is 2-8-4 degrees,

328
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,048
Twelve miles out,

329
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:53,325
It's "Air Force One,"
They want to talk to the vice president,

330
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,475
Hello, Can you hear me?

331
00:35:09,285 --> 00:35:11,753
This is the vice president
of the United States,

332
00:35:11,821 --> 00:35:14,847
To whom am I speaking?

333
00:35:14,957 --> 00:35:17,926
This is the person who controls
"Air Force One,"

334
00:35:17,994 --> 00:35:21,589
The world's most secure aircraft,

335
00:35:23,065 --> 00:35:25,124
What is it that you want?

336
00:35:26,302 --> 00:35:27,860
We'll get to that,

337
00:35:29,972 --> 00:35:32,702
- I want to speak to the First Lady,
- No,

338
00:35:36,912 --> 00:35:39,312
The president is safe,

339
00:35:39,382 --> 00:35:41,475
But then you must know that,

340
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:45,179
He ran from here like a whipped dog,

341
00:35:45,287 --> 00:35:48,450
I'm sure you can't wait for him
to get back to making the decisions,,,

342
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:53,484
so you can stop sweating
through that silk blouse of yours,

343
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,469
What is the condition
of the people on board?

344
00:36:00,569 --> 00:36:02,230
Some are dead,

345
00:36:03,873 --> 00:36:05,841
What are your intentions?

346
00:36:06,409 --> 00:36:10,903
What arrogance to think
you could ever understand my intentions,

347
00:36:11,013 --> 00:36:14,449
I want to understand
what it is that you want,

348
00:36:14,517 --> 00:36:16,485
What do I want?

349
00:36:17,586 --> 00:36:22,216
When Mother Russia becomes
one great nation again,,,

350
00:36:23,459 --> 00:36:26,826
when the capitalists are dragged
from the Kremlin,,,

351
00:36:29,999 --> 00:36:35,904
when our enemies run and hide in fear
at the mention of our name,,,

352
00:36:35,971 --> 00:36:40,601
and America begs our forgiveness,,,

353
00:36:40,743 --> 00:36:45,112
on that great day of deliverance,,,

354
00:36:45,181 --> 00:36:47,615
you will know what I want,

355
00:36:49,618 --> 00:36:51,779
We can give you a forum
for your grievances,

356
00:36:51,887 --> 00:36:54,219
We can contact the Russian government,

357
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,918
But you must understand
that it will take some time,

358
00:36:57,026 --> 00:37:00,052
Really?
When you talk to the president,,,

359
00:37:00,162 --> 00:37:04,292
you might remind him that I am holding
his wife, his daughter,,,

360
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,994
his chief of staff,
his national security advisor,,,

361
00:37:07,103 --> 00:37:10,834
his classified papers
and his baseball glove,

362
00:37:12,108 --> 00:37:17,307
If he wants them back, he will prevail
upon the puppet regime in Moscow,,,

363
00:37:17,413 --> 00:37:20,473
to release General Radek,

364
00:37:20,549 --> 00:37:22,517
Fifty for one,

365
00:37:22,551 --> 00:37:25,213
It's a good deal,

366
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:26,720
How's your blouse?

367
00:37:29,592 --> 00:37:33,551
What assurances do I have
that you'll keep your word?

368
00:37:33,662 --> 00:37:37,257
I'll wait for confirmation that
General Radek has been released,

369
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:40,034
Until then,,,

370
00:37:42,037 --> 00:37:45,097
I will execute a hostage
every half an hour,

371
00:37:47,877 --> 00:37:49,845
You have my word,

372
00:37:52,214 --> 00:37:55,843
You must understand that we...
Hello?

373
00:37:55,951 --> 00:37:57,384
They're off!

374
00:38:01,157 --> 00:38:02,886
Damn it!
Nobody does this,,,

375
00:38:02,992 --> 00:38:04,892
to the United States,

376
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,487
The president will get back his glove
and play catch with this guy's balls,

377
00:38:08,597 --> 00:38:11,395
We can't do anything in half an hour,
We need more time,

378
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,901
He's a zealot, Tough to negotiate with,
All you can do is wear them down,

379
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,403
Mr, Secretary!

380
00:38:25,047 --> 00:38:27,607
We found the escape pod,

381
00:38:27,716 --> 00:38:29,183
It's empty,

382
00:38:33,322 --> 00:38:35,347
So where's the president?

383
00:38:38,627 --> 00:38:42,154
I think we have to acknowledge
the possibility,,,

384
00:38:42,264 --> 00:38:45,893
that the president
may be dead,

385
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:56,110
Diversion,
Try to buy some time,

386
00:38:56,178 --> 00:38:58,806
It could have happened in a cross fire,
and they're afraid we'll retaliate,

387
00:38:58,948 --> 00:39:02,349
Damn right, we'll retaliate,
We'll release Radek into the atmosphere,

388
00:39:02,418 --> 00:39:06,479
It doesn't add up, That terrorist knew
we'd recover the pod in short order,

389
00:39:06,589 --> 00:39:08,614
He expected that we'd be talking
to Marshall,

390
00:39:08,724 --> 00:39:12,251
Let's not bury him yet,
He could still be alive in that plane,

391
00:39:12,361 --> 00:39:14,989
Let's not forget this president
is a Medal of Honor winner,

392
00:39:15,097 --> 00:39:18,828
In Vietnam, he flew more helicopter
missions than any man in my command,

393
00:39:18,934 --> 00:39:20,834
He knows how to fight,

394
00:39:20,936 --> 00:39:23,336
Then he's taking a terrible chance
with his life,

395
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:27,102
The element of surprise
is a formidable advantage in combat,

396
00:39:27,209 --> 00:39:30,110
If he's up there,
he's the best chance that we have,

397
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:32,704
That pod was designed
for a reason, General,

398
00:39:32,815 --> 00:39:35,682
He has no right to take chances
with his life,

399
00:41:39,742 --> 00:41:42,472
What does the psych profile say?
How far will he go?

400
00:41:42,578 --> 00:41:46,514
He's a Radek loyalist, That tells us
all we need to know, doesn't it?

401
00:41:46,582 --> 00:41:49,642
He'll see this thing through
to the last hostage or his own death,

402
00:41:49,752 --> 00:41:52,482
Release this bastard
and Central Asia will go up in flames!

403
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:53,782
I'm aware of that,

404
00:41:53,889 --> 00:41:57,256
Bring back the old Soviet empire
under a flag of genocide?

405
00:41:57,326 --> 00:41:59,419
Radek with a nuclear arsenal?

406
00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:02,621
I hate to say this,
but 50 people,,,

407
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:05,461
is a small price to pay
to stop that from happening,

408
00:42:05,534 --> 00:42:07,161
Even if one of them is the president?

409
00:42:07,269 --> 00:42:10,636
The presidency is bigger than any man,
Didn't they teach you that at Yale?

410
00:42:10,706 --> 00:42:14,164
Can't we release him today
and pick up the pieces tomorrow?

411
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:15,870
We caught him before,
we'll catch him again,

412
00:42:15,978 --> 00:42:18,412
If Petrov releases Radek,
his government will fall,

413
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,745
I promise you that,
Then who's gonna stand up to Radek?

414
00:42:21,817 --> 00:42:24,081
You go to catch him again,
you'll find him in Moscow,

415
00:42:25,087 --> 00:42:28,989
With respect, Mr, Secretary, we don't
need more dramatics, we need options,

416
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:30,991
- It's not an option,
- We need a decision,

417
00:42:31,093 --> 00:42:32,924
It's not her decision,

418
00:42:32,995 --> 00:42:35,589
This is a military situation,
I'm the secretary of defense,

419
00:42:35,697 --> 00:42:39,497
Check your regs, In the absence
of the president, the buck stops here,

420
00:42:39,568 --> 00:42:41,695
Get the attorney general
with a copy of the Constitution,

421
00:42:41,804 --> 00:42:45,001
We have... Oh, my God!
Nineteen minutes,

422
00:42:46,675 --> 00:42:49,109
I'm going to consult
with President Petrov,

423
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:09,031
Madam Vice President, I'm sorry,
I cannot release him,

424
00:47:09,137 --> 00:47:10,570
We would train,,,

425
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:13,608
all our military might
against this one target,

426
00:47:13,675 --> 00:47:15,734
- He wouldn't stay at large for long,
- Maybe so,

427
00:47:15,844 --> 00:47:18,142
But millions of lives
are hanging in the balance,

428
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:20,147
I am trying to save a nation!

429
00:47:20,215 --> 00:47:21,648
As am I,

430
00:47:21,717 --> 00:47:25,653
No nation can survive the loss,
nor soon replace, a great leader,

431
00:47:25,721 --> 00:47:28,656
Let us be pragmatic,
Fifty lives means nothing,,,

432
00:47:28,724 --> 00:47:30,157
in the grand scheme,

433
00:47:30,225 --> 00:47:31,954
Let me be equally pragmatic,

434
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,654
Our president took a great risk
to come to your aid,,,

435
00:47:34,763 --> 00:47:37,459
against strong opposition
in both parties and among our allies,

436
00:47:37,566 --> 00:47:39,864
It would be politically impossible
to do so again,

437
00:47:39,935 --> 00:47:42,995
If it meant saving his life,
I would gladly do it,

438
00:47:43,105 --> 00:47:45,039
But I would have to know for sure,

439
00:47:45,107 --> 00:47:47,439
And you cannot tell me he's alive,
can you?

440
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:50,544
No, Mr, President, I cannot,

441
00:47:50,612 --> 00:47:54,844
Then there is nothing I can do,
I am truly sorry, Good-bye,

442
00:47:57,919 --> 00:48:00,444
Okay, Walter,
you and your generals get to work,

443
00:48:46,568 --> 00:48:50,231
Okay, they can't keep the plane
in the air indefinitely,

444
00:48:50,338 --> 00:48:52,738
There are only four possible
landing sites in Kazakhstan,,,

445
00:48:52,808 --> 00:48:54,742
that are still controlled
by Radek's forces,

446
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:57,904
We have to go in and take all of them,
Can we do it?

447
00:48:58,013 --> 00:48:59,981
I'd rather take my chances in the air,

448
00:49:00,081 --> 00:49:02,515
I just looked at the airborne scenarios,
They're no good,

449
00:49:02,584 --> 00:49:06,520
- Can we do this?
- In the time we have? Messy,

450
00:49:06,588 --> 00:49:09,148
Three more minutes
before they execute the first hostage,

451
00:49:09,257 --> 00:49:11,191
You'll have to buy us more time,

452
00:49:11,259 --> 00:49:12,692
All right,

453
00:49:50,031 --> 00:49:52,465
You both, come here,

454
00:49:56,471 --> 00:49:57,768
Now!

455
00:50:13,188 --> 00:50:15,656
They will transfer the call here,

456
00:50:17,592 --> 00:50:19,287
So,,,

457
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:22,124
let's just wait,

458
00:50:28,036 --> 00:50:29,264
Excuse me,

459
00:50:31,773 --> 00:50:35,140
Sir, if you will permit me,
I am the national security advisor,

460
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:37,144
I'm the man the president
would be listening to,

461
00:50:37,212 --> 00:50:40,443
I believe you are negotiating right now
with the vice president,

462
00:50:40,515 --> 00:50:44,178
In our system, the vice president
is like the queen of England,

463
00:50:44,286 --> 00:50:46,481
She can't even get airline tickets
without talking,,,

464
00:50:46,621 --> 00:50:50,455
to somebody like me; therefore,
let me speak to the White House,

465
00:50:50,492 --> 00:50:54,724
I promise you, I'm the one person
who can make this all work out,

466
00:51:00,902 --> 00:51:02,767
Has he been released?

467
00:51:02,837 --> 00:51:07,035
I've contacted the Russian government,
We've set things in motion,

468
00:51:07,142 --> 00:51:09,235
But at this point,
we have to be realistic,

469
00:51:09,344 --> 00:51:11,278
It's going to take more time,

470
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,713
More time?

471
00:51:23,959 --> 00:51:25,893
He's a very good negotiator,

472
00:51:26,661 --> 00:51:29,391
He bought you another half hour,

473
00:51:39,808 --> 00:51:41,241
Mrs, Marshall,

474
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:44,137
Alice,

475
00:51:44,245 --> 00:51:47,339
If you please, come with me,

476
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,455
That's the first time
you ever seen a man killed, huh?

477
00:52:28,523 --> 00:52:30,457
Leave her alone,

478
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:34,755
You think I'm a monster?

479
00:52:34,863 --> 00:52:36,888
That I would kill this man?

480
00:52:36,998 --> 00:52:39,432
Somebody's son?

481
00:52:40,568 --> 00:52:42,934
Somebody's father?

482
00:52:44,472 --> 00:52:46,770
I am somebody's son, too,

483
00:52:47,976 --> 00:52:50,604
I have three small children,

484
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:54,015
Does that surprise you?

485
00:52:58,053 --> 00:52:59,987
- Tell her to answer,
- Leave her alone!

486
00:53:00,055 --> 00:53:01,283
Shut up!

487
00:53:07,062 --> 00:53:08,825
Why did you kill him?

488
00:53:09,931 --> 00:53:11,899
Because I believe,

489
00:53:13,501 --> 00:53:17,801
And when I shoot this man,
I know in that instant,,,

490
00:53:17,906 --> 00:53:21,034
how deep was my belief,

491
00:53:21,142 --> 00:53:24,236
That I would turn my back
on God Himself,,,

492
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:28,442
for Mother Russia,

493
00:53:29,451 --> 00:53:31,419
My doubts, my fears,

494
00:53:31,486 --> 00:53:34,216
My own private morality,

495
00:53:39,961 --> 00:53:41,485
for this love,

496
00:53:44,766 --> 00:53:47,360
You know, your father,
he has also killed,

497
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:51,664
- Is he a bad man?
- That's not true,

498
00:53:51,806 --> 00:53:53,671
Why?

499
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:59,077
Because he does it in a tuxedo
with a telephone call and a smart bomb?

500
00:54:00,615 --> 00:54:03,209
You are a monster,

501
00:54:03,318 --> 00:54:05,718
And my father is a great man,

502
00:54:06,921 --> 00:54:09,481
You're nothing like my father,

503
00:54:37,352 --> 00:54:39,320
What's the goddamn number?

504
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,488
- What city please?
- Washington D, C,, the White House,

505
00:54:48,596 --> 00:54:52,123
- Just a moment, Here's the number,
- Can you connect me to that number?

506
00:54:52,233 --> 00:54:54,758
- There's a connect fee of one dollar,
- Fine,

507
00:55:09,617 --> 00:55:12,108
White House switchboard,
How may I direct your call?

508
00:55:13,188 --> 00:55:15,622
All right, listen,
Listen carefully,

509
00:55:15,723 --> 00:55:18,988
This is an emergency call from
"Air Force One," This is the president,

510
00:55:19,093 --> 00:55:20,890
Connect me to the vice president,

511
00:55:20,995 --> 00:55:22,792
Who did you say is calling?

512
00:55:25,967 --> 00:55:29,459
- This is the president!
- Right, and I'm the First Lady,

513
00:55:29,537 --> 00:55:31,505
Don't cut me off,
This is an emergency,

514
00:55:31,539 --> 00:55:35,703
The president doesn't call this
particular number, so whoever you are...

515
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:37,971
Trace the call,

516
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,980
Follow your standard security procedure,

517
00:55:42,317 --> 00:55:44,478
Trace the goddamn call!

518
00:55:44,586 --> 00:55:48,613
Okay, sir, You want to make
a federal case out of this, fine by me!

519
00:55:57,031 --> 00:55:59,829
Hello, Anyone there?

520
00:55:59,934 --> 00:56:01,367
Don't move,

521
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:04,830
- I traced the call, sir,
- Give me the gun,

522
00:56:04,973 --> 00:56:07,567
- Are you there?
- Slowly,

523
00:56:07,675 --> 00:56:09,472
Oh, my God!

524
00:56:09,577 --> 00:56:11,670
I'll put you right through,
Mr, President,

525
00:56:17,785 --> 00:56:20,049
The switchboard has a call from someone
claiming to be the president,

526
00:56:20,855 --> 00:56:23,153
She traced it back to
the White House satellite account,

527
00:56:23,258 --> 00:56:25,317
The caller's gone,
but the line is still active,

528
00:56:25,426 --> 00:56:27,360
Put it through,

529
00:56:28,463 --> 00:56:30,055
Listen to me,

530
00:56:30,832 --> 00:56:33,062
Listen to me,
You know who I am,

531
00:56:34,569 --> 00:56:36,298
I'm the president of the United States,

532
00:56:36,404 --> 00:56:37,996
- Yes!
- Quiet!

533
00:56:38,106 --> 00:56:40,040
Don't think that means
I don't shoot you,

534
00:56:40,108 --> 00:56:42,076
Put your hands behind your head
and move,

535
00:56:51,986 --> 00:56:53,681
This is your lucky day,

536
00:56:53,788 --> 00:56:56,757
What more can my people do?
Tell the F-15s to fire at the plane?

537
00:56:56,824 --> 00:56:59,292
Even if they tried, we're equipped
with tactical countermeasures,

538
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,261
- He's talking to us,
- What do you mean?

539
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:05,731
I just want you to feel secure,
That way no one will get hurt,

540
00:57:05,833 --> 00:57:08,461
The computer will fly circles
around any missile they fire at us,

541
00:57:08,569 --> 00:57:11,504
- And no hit, just a shock wave,
- He's telling us what to do,

542
00:57:11,572 --> 00:57:14,769
Believe me, all that would happen
is that we'd get knocked off our feet,

543
00:57:14,876 --> 00:57:16,503
- That's all!
- Shut up!

544
00:57:21,049 --> 00:57:23,279
- Lf we're going to act, we must act now,
- It's too risky,

545
00:57:23,384 --> 00:57:25,443
The president is up there
with a gun to his head,

546
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,182
He's asking us to do that
to "Air Force One"?

547
00:57:28,289 --> 00:57:29,847
He's not asking,

548
00:57:29,991 --> 00:57:33,791
Your commander in chief has issued
a direct order, Do it!

549
00:57:38,499 --> 00:57:41,161
Are you sure that's what
you want me to do?

550
00:57:41,269 --> 00:57:44,864
You heard me, Let's pray it works
the way it's supposed to,

551
00:57:45,006 --> 00:57:46,906
Boys, give me room,

552
00:57:47,008 --> 00:57:50,444
I've been ordered to fire
on "Air Force One,"

553
00:58:03,057 --> 00:58:06,515
I'm in position,
Missiles are armed,

554
00:58:09,831 --> 00:58:12,959
The target is acquired,
I have a good lock,

555
00:58:14,469 --> 00:58:17,029
God, I hope this works,
Fox Three,

556
01:00:14,021 --> 01:00:15,488
This is Marshall,

557
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:18,824
- Anyone there?
- We're here, Mr, President,

558
01:00:18,926 --> 01:00:20,689
Where's my family?
Are they safe?

559
01:00:20,795 --> 01:00:23,263
The terrorists claim they're
holding them, We can't confirm,

560
01:00:23,331 --> 01:00:24,730
Who are they?

561
01:00:25,533 --> 01:00:27,091
What do they want?

562
01:00:27,235 --> 01:00:29,635
They're Russian ultranationalist
radicals, They want General Radek,,,

563
01:00:29,704 --> 01:00:31,797
released from prison,

564
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,932
- What are our tactical options?
- We're working on that,

565
01:00:36,043 --> 01:00:40,002
- But the bastards have us in a corner,
- There is no rescue attempt?

566
01:00:40,114 --> 01:00:43,515
I ruled out a midair rescue, We can
do nothing while the plane's in the air,

567
01:00:43,551 --> 01:00:47,009
We gotta get this plane on the ground,
Take me off the speakerphone,

568
01:00:47,121 --> 01:00:49,988
- Where's Bennett?
- Mr, President,

569
01:00:50,057 --> 01:00:52,082
We cannot release Radek,

570
01:00:52,226 --> 01:00:55,684
They're gonna shoot a hostage
every half hour until we do,

571
01:00:55,796 --> 01:00:57,889
I don't want a plane
full of dead people,

572
01:00:59,734 --> 01:01:01,668
They shotJack Doherty,

573
01:01:03,538 --> 01:01:04,971
Christ!

574
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:09,037
We can't give in to their demands,
It won't end there,

575
01:01:09,143 --> 01:01:11,611
If you die in the plane,
does it end there?

576
01:01:11,712 --> 01:01:14,112
We've got a job to do,,,

577
01:01:14,215 --> 01:01:16,149
whatever the cost,

578
01:01:23,691 --> 01:01:25,625
He'll want a glass of milk,

579
01:01:27,295 --> 01:01:29,695
We gotta get this plane
on the ground,

580
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:31,951
Get the plane on the ground,

581
01:03:57,545 --> 01:04:00,514
It is starting to feel
a little empty up here,

582
01:04:02,249 --> 01:04:04,740
Sit down, Please,

583
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:13,220
Come,

584
01:04:28,175 --> 01:04:31,042
Tell me your name again,,,

585
01:04:31,112 --> 01:04:33,580
for the record,

586
01:04:33,647 --> 01:04:35,342
Melanie,

587
01:04:36,484 --> 01:04:38,213
Melanie Mitchell,

588
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,686
You travel often,,,

589
01:04:41,756 --> 01:04:44,190
with the President?

590
01:04:44,258 --> 01:04:45,486
Yes,

591
01:04:45,593 --> 01:04:49,654
So you know everyone on the plane?

592
01:04:51,332 --> 01:04:52,890
Yes,

593
01:04:54,335 --> 01:04:56,803
I bet they like you, huh?

594
01:04:56,904 --> 01:05:00,169
You're a nice person, yes?

595
01:05:04,812 --> 01:05:06,746
I guess so,

596
01:05:27,401 --> 01:05:29,335
Why are you afraid?

597
01:05:30,504 --> 01:05:34,304
Because I don't wanna die,

598
01:05:38,379 --> 01:05:39,744
Tell me,,,

599
01:05:39,814 --> 01:05:43,215
what am I doing at this moment?

600
01:05:44,351 --> 01:05:47,218
You're pointing a gun at me,

601
01:05:48,155 --> 01:05:49,816
Thank you, Melanie,

602
01:05:50,858 --> 01:05:54,419
This is to the secret service agent
in the baggage deck,

603
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:57,923
I will count to ten,

604
01:05:58,032 --> 01:06:01,900
And if you do not surrender,
this nice woman will die,

605
01:06:04,171 --> 01:06:05,399
One,

606
01:06:05,506 --> 01:06:07,565
- Please don't,
- Two,

607
01:06:07,675 --> 01:06:10,838
- Don't do this!
- Three,

608
01:06:10,945 --> 01:06:13,607
- Let me talk to him!
- Four,

609
01:06:13,714 --> 01:06:15,341
- I beg you, please,
- Five,

610
01:06:15,449 --> 01:06:17,576
Let me talk to the agent,

611
01:06:17,685 --> 01:06:19,915
- Six,
- He might listen to me,

612
01:06:20,821 --> 01:06:22,220
Seven,

613
01:06:22,289 --> 01:06:24,519
- I beg you, don't do this,
- Eight,

614
01:06:24,625 --> 01:06:28,117
- Don't do this, please!
- Nine!

615
01:06:41,275 --> 01:06:42,799
Oh, God,

616
01:06:49,016 --> 01:06:51,883
Let's think about that one
for a moment,

617
01:06:51,952 --> 01:06:55,718
And then we'll start again,

618
01:06:55,823 --> 01:06:57,882
Next time,,,

619
01:06:57,992 --> 01:07:00,586
I'll choose someone
more important,

620
01:07:24,418 --> 01:07:26,477
You want me dead,

621
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:30,147
It may come to that,
In a war, people die,

622
01:07:30,257 --> 01:07:32,225
This isn't war!

623
01:07:33,327 --> 01:07:36,023
You just murdered
an unarmed woman,

624
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:40,499
You, who murdered 100,000 Iraqis
to save a nickel on a gallon of gas,,,

625
01:07:40,534 --> 01:07:43,731
are going to lecture me
about the rules of war?

626
01:07:43,837 --> 01:07:45,031
Don't!

627
01:07:47,841 --> 01:07:49,775
Mr, President,
how can I help you?

628
01:07:49,843 --> 01:07:53,074
Chief, you can help me
dump some fuel,

629
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:55,546
Who's down there in the baggage deck?

630
01:07:55,649 --> 01:07:58,550
- It's a secret service agent, Who?
- We have no idea,

631
01:07:58,652 --> 01:08:01,246
Melanie was shot because one of your men
wouldn't show himself,

632
01:08:01,355 --> 01:08:03,619
- I want to know who he is,
- We'd like to know ourselves,

633
01:08:03,724 --> 01:08:06,693
Sir, it's someone
smart enough to know,,,

634
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,194
if you're hunting with one bullet,
you wait for a clean shot,

635
01:08:09,263 --> 01:08:11,424
What are you saying?

636
01:08:11,498 --> 01:08:15,161
Whoever that is down there,
he may be our only hope,

637
01:08:15,269 --> 01:08:19,433
Our only hope is that Washington
complies with this bastard,

638
01:08:19,506 --> 01:08:22,339
Because any minute now
another one of us is dead,

639
01:08:23,944 --> 01:08:25,536
And you know what?

640
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:29,376
I'm afraid it might be me,

641
01:08:33,287 --> 01:08:36,154
- Sir, do you see the maintenance panel?
- I see it,

642
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:39,488
Pop it open, There should be
a red switch, Toggle it up,

643
01:08:39,593 --> 01:08:41,754
Hang on,

644
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:45,858
We got some indicator lights here,

645
01:08:45,966 --> 01:08:48,935
To dump the fuel, you have to close
the circuit for the pump,

646
01:08:49,036 --> 01:08:52,164
There's no switch,
so you'll have to cross the wires,

647
01:08:52,272 --> 01:08:55,469
- Open the fuel control door,
- Hang on,

648
01:08:57,344 --> 01:08:59,608
There should be five of them,

649
01:08:59,747 --> 01:09:02,375
- Do you see them, sir?
- I see them, Yeah,

650
01:09:02,483 --> 01:09:06,249
Jesus, There's a lot of goddamn wires,
All right, wait a second,

651
01:09:06,353 --> 01:09:07,786
We got five,

652
01:09:07,855 --> 01:09:10,983
Green, yellow, red, white and blue,

653
01:09:11,091 --> 01:09:12,558
Let me double-check,

654
01:09:12,693 --> 01:09:14,718
Come on, For Christ's sake, hurry up,

655
01:09:14,828 --> 01:09:17,558
Get the wrong wire, you'll cut
the engine feeds, The plane will crash,

656
01:09:17,698 --> 01:09:20,792
Then we don't want to get
the wrong wire, do we?

657
01:09:20,901 --> 01:09:22,528
Cut the green wire,

658
01:09:26,974 --> 01:09:28,271
Cut,

659
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:33,574
- Then, cross the... With the...
- With the what?

660
01:09:33,714 --> 01:09:37,047
Hello? Cross it with the what?
Say again,

661
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:40,314
Cross the green wire with the...

662
01:09:44,258 --> 01:09:45,885
For Christ's sake!

663
01:09:45,993 --> 01:09:48,655
Wait, green,,,

664
01:09:48,796 --> 01:09:50,229
yellow,,,

665
01:09:55,636 --> 01:09:57,604
I'm counting on you,
red, white and blue,

666
01:10:16,323 --> 01:10:20,020
Sirs, it looks like "Air Force One"
is losing fuel,

667
01:12:03,230 --> 01:12:08,293
Madam Vice President, the time has come
for you to demonstrate your good faith,

668
01:12:08,402 --> 01:12:10,768
I've been reading through
your press kit,

669
01:12:10,871 --> 01:12:16,138
I understand "Air Force One"
is able to refuel in midair,

670
01:12:17,344 --> 01:12:20,074
We need fuel,
And we need it now,

671
01:12:21,081 --> 01:12:24,209
I'm sure we can come
to some sort of arrangement,

672
01:12:24,318 --> 01:12:27,776
If you'll land the plane,
we'll trade fuel for hostages,

673
01:12:27,921 --> 01:12:29,889
This is bullshit!

674
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:34,484
It's simple physics, Without fuel,
the plane crashes, Everybody dies,

675
01:12:34,561 --> 01:12:36,825
We're trying to do everything
that we can,

676
01:12:36,964 --> 01:12:41,196
Tell me what I want to hear, or I will
execute a member of the senior staff,,,

677
01:12:41,301 --> 01:12:45,237
and continue killing one hostage
every minute,,,

678
01:12:45,339 --> 01:12:49,275
until the plane crash
or refueling plane arrive!

679
01:12:53,614 --> 01:12:55,548
What do you say?

680
01:12:57,684 --> 01:12:59,481
Fuel's on its way,

681
01:12:59,553 --> 01:13:01,077
Thank you,

682
01:13:35,722 --> 01:13:37,212
Move,

683
01:13:54,074 --> 01:13:57,669
- Jim, what are you doing here?
- I never left,

684
01:14:04,017 --> 01:14:05,746
Watch the door,

685
01:14:05,852 --> 01:14:07,376
Where's my family?

686
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:09,682
Another part of the plane,
We haven't seen them,

687
01:14:09,790 --> 01:14:11,917
We got weapons now,
We should try to retake the plane,

688
01:14:12,059 --> 01:14:14,254
Not while they've got Grace and Alice,
I can't take that chance,

689
01:14:14,361 --> 01:14:17,489
What about trying to disable the plane
and force them to land?

690
01:14:17,597 --> 01:14:21,328
I tried, I dumped some fuel,
Now they're gonna refuel us in midair,

691
01:14:21,435 --> 01:14:25,337
A refueling tanker?
Jesus! Sir?

692
01:14:25,405 --> 01:14:29,865
- There may be a way to get people off,
- What do you mean?

693
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:33,138
We have emergency parachutes
in the tail cone, but we're too high,

694
01:14:33,246 --> 01:14:36,215
If we could get a message
to the refueling tanker,,,

695
01:14:36,283 --> 01:14:38,410
get him to drop to 15,000 feet,
we could jump,

696
01:14:38,518 --> 01:14:41,487
They've disabled the phones,
They control the radios,

697
01:14:41,555 --> 01:14:46,891
- Mr, President? Sir? The fax machines,
- The phone lines are out,

698
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:51,158
No, Voice lines and faxes are on
two different systems of encryption,

699
01:14:51,264 --> 01:14:53,789
If you disable one,
it'd be easy to overlook the other,

700
01:14:57,871 --> 01:15:00,897
If this works, you get to be
postmaster general, Come with me,

701
01:15:01,041 --> 01:15:02,941
- Get these people ready,
- Yes, Remember,

702
01:15:03,043 --> 01:15:07,139
15,000 feet and 200 knots,
Otherwise it's suicide,

703
01:15:07,247 --> 01:15:09,340
You'll need this,

704
01:15:10,817 --> 01:15:12,842
Good luck, people,

705
01:15:23,897 --> 01:15:26,127
- Where are we sending it?
- Situation Room,

706
01:15:27,434 --> 01:15:29,595
It makes me so proud
that you stuck with us,

707
01:15:31,471 --> 01:15:33,735
- Thanks,
- Whatever happens,

708
01:16:02,869 --> 01:16:04,336
Yes!

709
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:25,758
Madam Vice President,
the attorney general is here,

710
01:16:29,896 --> 01:16:33,593
- Thank you for coming, Andrew,
- Good that you're here,

711
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:37,830
You want my interpretation of what the
Constitution says about the situation?

712
01:16:37,938 --> 01:16:40,406
Yes, Andrew,
my understanding is,,,

713
01:16:40,474 --> 01:16:43,637
that if the president is out of contact
in a military situation,,,

714
01:16:43,743 --> 01:16:46,473
the secretary of defense
is in charge as second in command,

715
01:16:46,546 --> 01:16:49,071
- Yes, of course,
- Good, Then that settles it,

716
01:16:49,216 --> 01:16:51,184
It doesn't settle it at all,

717
01:16:51,251 --> 01:16:55,517
The president is not merely out
of contact, He is also under duress,

718
01:16:55,622 --> 01:16:59,149
His family is held hostage,
possibly himself a hostage,

719
01:16:59,259 --> 01:17:04,094
It creates an incapacity to discharge
the office under the 25th amendment,

720
01:17:04,197 --> 01:17:06,427
Surely just as if he'd had a stroke,

721
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:09,526
I think the president would dispute
that any incapacity exists,

722
01:17:09,636 --> 01:17:14,596
It exists if a majority of the cabinet,
including yourself, says it exists,

723
01:17:14,708 --> 01:17:18,644
The president may be alive,
but he may not be the president,

724
01:17:18,712 --> 01:17:21,044
Madam Vice President?
I think you need to see this,

725
01:17:21,181 --> 01:17:23,649
This is CNN breaking news,

726
01:17:25,685 --> 01:17:29,416
We interrupt programming to bring you
this breaking news bulletin,

727
01:17:29,523 --> 01:17:32,686
CNN has received
unconfirmed reports,,,

728
01:17:32,792 --> 01:17:35,283
that "Air Force One"has crashed,

729
01:17:35,362 --> 01:17:37,922
- Oh, my God! How did they get that?
- I don't know,

730
01:17:38,031 --> 01:17:41,489
The aircraft was en route from Moscow
when it began its Mayday hail,

731
01:17:41,601 --> 01:17:43,831
I repeat,
We have unconfirmed reports,,,

732
01:17:43,937 --> 01:17:45,871
Call the press room,
We have to issue a statement,

733
01:17:45,939 --> 01:17:48,806
that the president's plane
has crashed in Eastern Europe,

734
01:18:20,106 --> 01:18:23,769
- Has "Air Force One" crashed?
- That is a rumor,

735
01:18:23,877 --> 01:18:27,438
- Where'd the story come from?
- I don't know where it came from,

736
01:18:27,514 --> 01:18:30,574
Listen,
I cannot confirm anything,,,

737
01:18:30,684 --> 01:18:32,652
at this point,

738
01:18:37,958 --> 01:18:40,927
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have a statement,

739
01:18:43,897 --> 01:18:48,027
The president's plane,
"Air Force One," has been hijacked,

740
01:18:50,604 --> 01:18:52,504
Please,

741
01:18:52,572 --> 01:18:55,564
Ladies and gentlemen,
please let me finish,

742
01:18:55,675 --> 01:18:58,200
For security reasons,
I cannot divulge,,,

743
01:18:58,345 --> 01:19:01,781
the identity of the hijackers
or who was on board the plane,

744
01:19:01,881 --> 01:19:05,373
But I'm here to assure
the American people,,,

745
01:19:05,485 --> 01:19:08,682
that we are doing everything we can
to resolve the situation,

746
01:19:10,523 --> 01:19:13,356
For the safety of all the people
on the plane,,,

747
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:16,725
I cannot tell you any more than I have,
and I'm sure you understand that,

748
01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:18,627
Is James Marshall still the president?

749
01:19:18,732 --> 01:19:22,190
I'm coordinating with
the National Security Council,,,

750
01:19:22,335 --> 01:19:24,394
pending the president's return,

751
01:19:24,504 --> 01:19:26,472
And, yes, James Marshall
is still the president,

752
01:19:28,508 --> 01:19:31,136
At this time...

753
01:19:31,244 --> 01:19:35,681
At this time,
I would like to ask all Americans,,,

754
01:19:39,586 --> 01:19:43,181
to pray for the safety of everyone
on board "Air Force One,"

755
01:19:43,323 --> 01:19:45,257
Thank you,

756
01:19:48,328 --> 01:19:49,818
The president,

757
01:19:57,937 --> 01:20:00,462
Where is the president?

758
01:20:42,782 --> 01:20:46,684
Folks, listen up,
This is your main rip cord,

759
01:20:46,753 --> 01:20:48,914
As soon as you clear the plane,
give it a yank,

760
01:20:49,022 --> 01:20:51,991
If your chute doesn't open,
this is your reserve chute,

761
01:20:52,092 --> 01:20:53,719
Pull it down, Clear?

762
01:21:16,449 --> 01:21:19,646
"Air Force One,"do you read?

763
01:21:19,753 --> 01:21:22,722
Yes, we read, Go ahead,

764
01:21:22,789 --> 01:21:25,656
"Air Force One,"
this is "Extender 1-0,"

765
01:21:25,725 --> 01:21:29,058
- We have been instructed to refuel you,
- Go ahead,

766
01:21:29,162 --> 01:21:33,565
Drop to 15,000 feet
and slow to 200 knots,

767
01:21:33,633 --> 01:21:36,295
Acknowledged, Two hundred,

768
01:21:40,039 --> 01:21:43,133
- They got it!
- They got the fax,

769
01:21:43,243 --> 01:21:45,677
Sir, your chute,

770
01:21:45,745 --> 01:21:48,509
- Please, sir,
- I'm not leaving without my family,

771
01:21:50,216 --> 01:21:53,344
Okay, "Air Force One,"
you need to open your receptacle door,

772
01:21:53,486 --> 01:21:56,387
Pull the yellow lever
on the upper control panel,

773
01:21:57,357 --> 01:21:58,483
Done,

774
01:21:58,558 --> 01:22:01,288
Go ahead and close distance
nice and easy,

775
01:22:04,998 --> 01:22:06,488
Almost there,

776
01:22:08,701 --> 01:22:12,000
- Where are your chutes?
- We stay with the president, sir,

777
01:22:14,207 --> 01:22:15,333
Thank you,

778
01:22:21,614 --> 01:22:25,209
All right, that's close enough,
Here we go!

779
01:22:32,625 --> 01:22:32,792
Go! Go!

780
01:22:32,792 --> 01:22:34,692
Go! Go!

781
01:22:34,761 --> 01:22:36,353
Go! Come on!

782
01:22:39,666 --> 01:22:42,362
Go! You, come on!

783
01:23:17,937 --> 01:23:19,734
We got,,,

784
01:23:19,839 --> 01:23:23,297
so far 25 chutes,

785
01:23:45,265 --> 01:23:48,462
- I can't hold her,
- What are you doing?

786
01:23:48,601 --> 01:23:51,069
Break away! Break away!

787
01:23:57,810 --> 01:24:00,142
Sir, take my hand!

788
01:24:13,493 --> 01:24:15,723
Everybody, break now!

789
01:24:30,710 --> 01:24:32,974
- Don't move!
- Let me save him!

790
01:24:33,079 --> 01:24:36,378
He's the president,
for God's sake!

791
01:24:46,626 --> 01:24:48,526
Grab my hand!

792
01:24:50,663 --> 01:24:52,028
Major!

793
01:24:56,135 --> 01:24:58,103
I got you,

794
01:25:11,851 --> 01:25:13,978
We've lost the tanker?
What else?

795
01:25:14,087 --> 01:25:17,318
- They're counting 32 survivors,
- That means they still have hostages,

796
01:25:17,423 --> 01:25:19,687
- What about the first family?
- No word yet,

797
01:25:19,792 --> 01:25:21,919
Losing hostages will make
the terrorists more desperate,

798
01:25:22,028 --> 01:25:25,464
Madam Vice President,
we've got "Air Force One" on the line,

799
01:25:25,498 --> 01:25:29,332
This is Vice President Bennett,
We're listening,

800
01:25:29,435 --> 01:25:31,403
I now hold hostage,,,

801
01:25:31,471 --> 01:25:34,838
the president of the United States
of America,

802
01:25:36,175 --> 01:25:39,975
Soon we shall enter
the sovereign airspace of Kazakhstan,

803
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:45,310
You will cease your military escort
at the border,

804
01:25:46,319 --> 01:25:48,514
If you violate our airspace,,,

805
01:25:48,621 --> 01:25:52,079
I will execute a member
of the first family,

806
01:25:53,259 --> 01:25:55,523
Tell our fighters to back off,

807
01:25:58,364 --> 01:25:59,854
Get me Ops,

808
01:26:02,702 --> 01:26:06,468
You said a presidential incapacity
could be declared by a cabinet majority,

809
01:26:06,572 --> 01:26:09,507
- Would you sign it?
- Under the circumstances,

810
01:26:09,542 --> 01:26:11,635
See who else would,

811
01:26:20,586 --> 01:26:22,986
Move! Come on, move!

812
01:26:25,191 --> 01:26:29,287
Fast! Move! Quick! Right here,

813
01:26:34,434 --> 01:26:37,892
- It'll be all right,
- I know,

814
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:02,491
You've been very busy downstairs,

815
01:27:03,796 --> 01:27:05,320
Haven't you?

816
01:27:06,399 --> 01:27:08,594
Killing my men,

817
01:27:28,788 --> 01:27:31,154
You don't wanna do that,

818
01:27:32,258 --> 01:27:35,694
I'm what you came for,
Don't forget that,

819
01:27:35,828 --> 01:27:38,422
Then I kill them,

820
01:27:38,498 --> 01:27:40,261
Or just one,

821
01:27:40,366 --> 01:27:42,459
You pick,

822
01:27:42,535 --> 01:27:46,335
That's what you do in the White House,
You play God,

823
01:27:53,346 --> 01:27:55,678
Go ahead,

824
01:27:55,815 --> 01:27:57,715
Which one lives?

825
01:27:59,819 --> 01:28:01,548
Go ahead,

826
01:28:10,263 --> 01:28:14,097
You're not here for this,
You want something,

827
01:28:16,102 --> 01:28:18,229
- What is it?
- Radek,

828
01:28:18,337 --> 01:28:22,273
- How can I do that? I can't,
- Then you die, the three of you,

829
01:28:22,375 --> 01:28:24,935
I'll do anything to save my family,
Don't ask something I can't give!

830
01:28:25,044 --> 01:28:29,140
The most powerful man on the earth,
Suddenly, there are things you can't do,

831
01:28:29,248 --> 01:28:33,378
This is very curious,
Stop with your fucking lies!

832
01:28:44,096 --> 01:28:48,192
- Petrov will never give up Radek,
- Petrov is a dog,

833
01:28:48,301 --> 01:28:51,065
He does what you tell him,

834
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:56,738
Tell him to do this,

835
01:28:56,876 --> 01:29:01,973
Petrov used me,
I just wanted to stop the bloodshed,

836
01:29:02,081 --> 01:29:05,244
He wanted a personal victory,
Petrov hates Radek,

837
01:29:05,351 --> 01:29:09,185
Of course he hates Radek,
Radek is everything he is not,

838
01:29:09,288 --> 01:29:11,756
A great man, a strong man,

839
01:29:11,891 --> 01:29:14,587
Are you saying,,,

840
01:29:14,694 --> 01:29:16,719
he would refuse you?

841
01:29:16,829 --> 01:29:21,459
You'd be playing right into his hands,
Are you an idiot?

842
01:29:21,567 --> 01:29:26,402
You'd make him into a hero,
The man who stopped the terrorists,

843
01:29:26,505 --> 01:29:29,303
Or better yet,
the man who stopped me,

844
01:29:30,910 --> 01:29:33,344
You talk as if you have nothing
to do with this,

845
01:29:35,915 --> 01:29:39,214
This is all your doing,

846
01:29:39,318 --> 01:29:42,116
This infection you call freedom,

847
01:29:42,221 --> 01:29:44,519
Without meaning, without purpose,

848
01:29:45,458 --> 01:29:47,653
You have given my country,,,

849
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,251
to gangsters and prostitutes,

850
01:29:51,797 --> 01:29:55,460
You have taken everything from us,

851
01:29:58,871 --> 01:30:01,362
There is nothing left,

852
01:30:09,482 --> 01:30:10,949
Call him,

853
01:30:29,602 --> 01:30:31,194
Sit!

854
01:30:31,304 --> 01:30:33,499
- No,
- I have no choice,

855
01:30:36,075 --> 01:30:38,543
- You have the choice,
- Leave her alone, It's between us,

856
01:30:38,644 --> 01:30:41,442
You lose a child,
it hollows you out,

857
01:30:41,514 --> 01:30:43,482
We're soldiers,

858
01:30:44,517 --> 01:30:46,917
You take my life,

859
01:30:48,020 --> 01:30:49,920
Have you no honor?

860
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:52,815
- I'll count to five,
- No!

861
01:30:52,925 --> 01:30:55,052
- It's gonna be all right, honey,
- One,

862
01:30:55,161 --> 01:30:57,425
- It's gonna be all right,
- Two,

863
01:30:57,496 --> 01:31:00,192
I'll do it,

864
01:31:00,299 --> 01:31:01,732
Yes,

865
01:31:01,801 --> 01:31:03,769
I'll do it,

866
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:10,200
You just leave my family alone,

867
01:31:17,616 --> 01:31:19,584
Leave 'em alone,

868
01:31:43,109 --> 01:31:44,474
Mr, President!

869
01:31:47,046 --> 01:31:49,071
We just got an intercept,

870
01:31:49,181 --> 01:31:51,615
The president called Petrov
and asked him to release Radek,

871
01:31:52,852 --> 01:31:55,320
- He can't do that!
- He must have no choice,

872
01:31:55,388 --> 01:31:57,686
We have a choice,

873
01:31:57,790 --> 01:32:02,250
I have the signatures of the cabinet
attesting to the president's incapacity,

874
01:32:02,361 --> 01:32:05,762
- Sign it and you can overrule him,
- No, I won't do that,

875
01:32:05,831 --> 01:32:09,460
The United States does not negotiate
with terrorists,

876
01:32:09,568 --> 01:32:11,502
It's been our principle
for 25 years,

877
01:32:11,570 --> 01:32:13,765
You can't give in to them now,

878
01:32:13,873 --> 01:32:16,671
It'll be open season on
the United States, Many more will die,

879
01:32:19,478 --> 01:32:23,847
Jim isn't making this decision as
president, but as a husband and father,

880
01:32:27,353 --> 01:32:29,844
History will judge you
by what you do right now,

881
01:32:29,955 --> 01:32:31,980
For God's sake, sign it,

882
01:33:10,796 --> 01:33:15,392
I can now confirm that General Radek
is in the process of being released,

883
01:33:15,501 --> 01:33:18,902
I repeat, General Radek
is now being released,

884
01:33:40,493 --> 01:33:44,554
Yes, yes,
General Radek has been released,

885
01:33:49,235 --> 01:33:51,100
It is confirmed,

886
01:33:54,006 --> 01:33:56,406
They are releasing the general,

887
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:58,775
Now what?

888
01:33:58,844 --> 01:34:01,813
Now we return to our homeland,,,

889
01:34:01,881 --> 01:34:04,816
where Radek will decide
how best to use you,,,

890
01:34:04,884 --> 01:34:06,943
now that we know you are willing,,,

891
01:34:07,052 --> 01:34:08,713
to negotiate,

892
01:34:10,022 --> 01:34:12,513
Our nation needs so many things,

893
01:34:12,558 --> 01:34:16,619
- You said you were gonna release us,
- Forgive me, I lied,

894
01:34:59,505 --> 01:35:00,904
Listen,

895
01:36:37,469 --> 01:36:39,767
- Sir, are you hit?
- Stay with the major, honey,

896
01:36:39,872 --> 01:36:42,670
- Alice, get in the cockpit,
- Lie down,

897
01:37:12,838 --> 01:37:16,296
- Let her go!
- Not until Radek is safely away,

898
01:37:18,210 --> 01:37:20,235
Call it off,
Don't give up Radek,

899
01:37:20,379 --> 01:37:24,440
If anything happens to the general,
your wife will die!

900
01:37:38,163 --> 01:37:41,599
You hear that?
It's almost over, Mr, President,

901
01:38:15,801 --> 01:38:17,200
Drop the gun!

902
01:38:28,781 --> 01:38:34,014
You made one mistake when
you killed my pilot, Mr, President,

903
01:38:34,119 --> 01:38:37,213
No one left to fly the plane,

904
01:38:40,526 --> 01:38:43,120
And no parachute,

905
01:38:44,897 --> 01:38:47,365
Whatever happens,,,

906
01:38:48,767 --> 01:38:51,395
you lose and I win,

907
01:39:45,824 --> 01:39:47,758
Get off my plane!

908
01:40:07,346 --> 01:40:08,745
You all right?

909
01:40:12,384 --> 01:40:13,783
Go,

910
01:40:13,886 --> 01:40:16,480
Go! Call Petrov!

911
01:41:18,917 --> 01:41:20,817
They killed him,

912
01:41:20,919 --> 01:41:22,477
Mr, President,

913
01:41:30,862 --> 01:41:35,162
He almost got away,
Did you hear me? Radek is dead,

914
01:41:35,267 --> 01:41:38,532
Yes! It's the president,
We have retaken the plane!

915
01:41:52,517 --> 01:41:55,111
- I don't suppose you know how to fly,
- No, sir,

916
01:41:55,220 --> 01:41:57,745
- Come along, I'll need a copilot,
- Yes, sir,

917
01:42:07,666 --> 01:42:09,327
Nothing like this,

918
01:42:09,434 --> 01:42:11,561
- Anybody there?
- We're here, sir,

919
01:42:11,703 --> 01:42:13,728
You got somebody
that can help me fly this?

920
01:42:13,839 --> 01:42:17,673
Sir, this is ColonelJackson, We need
to get you out of hostile territory,

921
01:42:17,776 --> 01:42:21,507
- Good idea, Bob,
- Look above the central video screen,

922
01:42:21,613 --> 01:42:25,879
There's a series of L, E, D, numbers,
One of them should read 1-1-0,

923
01:42:25,984 --> 01:42:28,384
- Got it,
- That's your course heading,

924
01:42:28,487 --> 01:42:31,923
Just below, there's a knob
surrounded by hash marks,

925
01:42:32,024 --> 01:42:35,619
Turn that knob counterclockwise
to 290,

926
01:42:37,362 --> 01:42:39,091
- We're turning,
- Good,

927
01:42:42,934 --> 01:42:45,129
- This will take you out of Kazakhstan,
- We're gonna be okay,

928
01:42:46,138 --> 01:42:50,165
We can't land this plane on autopilot,
so we'll need to go over a few things,

929
01:42:51,910 --> 01:42:54,378
Where's the nearest safe landing site?

930
01:42:54,479 --> 01:42:57,209
Incirlik, Turkey,

931
01:42:57,315 --> 01:42:59,215
- General Northwood,
- Madam?

932
01:42:59,317 --> 01:43:01,808
What's that?

933
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:06,983
- That red dot represents MiGs,
- On course to intercept "Air Force One,"

934
01:43:07,092 --> 01:43:09,424
Christ! They took off from Aktubinsk,

935
01:43:09,494 --> 01:43:12,361
The base commander there
is loyal to Radek,

936
01:43:12,464 --> 01:43:16,366
General, send our fighters
into Kazakhstan,

937
01:43:16,468 --> 01:43:19,801
Order them to use any and all means
to protect the president,

938
01:43:19,905 --> 01:43:23,136
When you're on final approach,
keep the throttles mid-range,

939
01:43:23,241 --> 01:43:25,436
- Mr, President, can you hear me?
- Yes, Kathryn,

940
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:28,570
We're tracking six MiGs closing
on your position, I'm sending in,,,

941
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:30,580
our F-15s to protect you,

942
01:43:30,682 --> 01:43:32,877
- Shit!
- Did she say MiGs?

943
01:43:32,984 --> 01:43:35,452
Yes, she said MiGs,

944
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:38,489
Get in that seat and put a seat belt on,
We're having trouble,

945
01:43:41,159 --> 01:43:44,993
These MiGs get closer,
I'm gonna have to maneuver this thing,

946
01:43:45,097 --> 01:43:47,065
How do I get it off autopilot?

947
01:43:47,165 --> 01:43:50,328
Push the button on the yoke
by your left thumb,

948
01:43:50,435 --> 01:43:52,835
I'll try a little right turn,

949
01:43:52,938 --> 01:43:55,463
Keep your moves smooth and steady,
It's all flying,

950
01:43:55,540 --> 01:43:58,805
Just step on the ball,

951
01:43:58,910 --> 01:44:01,037
That's right,
Just like riding a bike,

952
01:44:01,146 --> 01:44:05,344
Halo Flight, we are cleared to commit,
bearing 0-9-0,

953
01:44:05,450 --> 01:44:07,509
Jettison tanks and push it up,

954
01:44:12,424 --> 01:44:15,325
These MiGs, how far away are they?

955
01:44:18,163 --> 01:44:19,528
Never mind,

956
01:44:38,116 --> 01:44:42,177
- One coming, Countermeasures activated,
- Left turn,

957
01:44:46,424 --> 01:44:47,914
Jesus Christ!

958
01:44:48,026 --> 01:44:51,086
- We need some help,
- U, S, fighters, this is "Air Force One,"

959
01:44:51,196 --> 01:44:52,891
We are under attack,
Where are you?

960
01:44:52,998 --> 01:44:57,435
This is Halo Flight closing
on your position, E, T, A, two minutes,

961
01:44:57,502 --> 01:44:59,197
We may not be here!

962
01:45:07,179 --> 01:45:08,111
We're hit!

963
01:45:09,714 --> 01:45:13,275
Christ, We're on fire,
We've got an engine on fire,

964
01:45:13,385 --> 01:45:16,445
- Number four engine is on fire,
- Pull the fire handle overhead,

965
01:45:16,521 --> 01:45:18,489
I got it,

966
01:45:21,359 --> 01:45:24,988
- We're rolling right,
- Left rudder, You have to compensate,

967
01:45:25,096 --> 01:45:27,894
- Do I pull back on number one engine?
- Negative, You'll slow down,

968
01:45:30,101 --> 01:45:33,298
- Knob, Aft pedestal,
- Jesus Christ!

969
01:45:33,405 --> 01:45:37,808
We got a red light,
Looks like we're losing fuel,

970
01:45:39,544 --> 01:45:40,772
Halo Flight,

971
01:45:40,912 --> 01:45:43,073
Everybody lock a bandit,

972
01:45:43,181 --> 01:45:45,342
Stand by for max range,

973
01:45:45,450 --> 01:45:47,475
And Fox Three!

974
01:46:04,236 --> 01:46:06,101
Kill one!

975
01:46:10,942 --> 01:46:15,379
Kill two! Four more bandits
bearing 0-9-0, Halo Flight engage!

976
01:46:18,483 --> 01:46:20,644
Ha, ha! Good guys are here,

977
01:46:23,455 --> 01:46:26,652
- Bug out west, We'll cover you,
- You got it,

978
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:32,129
- Sir, pull up! You got one on your tail,
- Get him off my tail!

979
01:46:34,232 --> 01:46:35,392
Missile away,

980
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:39,698
- Break left and climb!
- Shit! Sir, we've lost countermeasures,

981
01:46:41,172 --> 01:46:44,335
This is "Halo 2," They've lost
countermeasures, I'm going in,

982
01:46:53,018 --> 01:46:55,213
Two's down! "Halo 2"is down!

983
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:57,515
"Air Force One,"
are you still with us?

984
01:46:57,622 --> 01:46:59,817
Yes! We're still here,

985
01:47:05,897 --> 01:47:07,990
Not so fast, you son of a bitch!

986
01:47:16,675 --> 01:47:18,472
The last three MiGs
are bugging out, sir,

987
01:47:23,481 --> 01:47:25,176
- Bob, are you still there?
- Yes, sir,

988
01:47:25,283 --> 01:47:28,878
Got a little problem here,
My rudder is sluggish,

989
01:47:29,020 --> 01:47:30,510
Let me look,

990
01:47:34,592 --> 01:47:36,423
Oh, man!

991
01:47:36,494 --> 01:47:38,724
Sir, you're torn up pretty bad,

992
01:47:38,830 --> 01:47:41,458
Do you have any elevator control?

993
01:47:41,533 --> 01:47:44,696
It's sluggish, too,
And we're still losing fuel,

994
01:47:47,706 --> 01:47:51,870
We got a problem up here,
Sirs, "Air Force One" is badly hit,

995
01:47:53,011 --> 01:47:56,879
With the damage,
there's no way they can land,

996
01:48:00,318 --> 01:48:01,751
I'm sorry, sir,

997
01:48:03,822 --> 01:48:07,223
- Thanks for your help,
- I'll stay on your wing, sir,

998
01:48:07,325 --> 01:48:09,953
Take it straight and steady
until we figure out what to do,

999
01:48:11,096 --> 01:48:12,290
Sir,

1000
01:48:14,566 --> 01:48:16,966
You did great,

1001
01:48:36,855 --> 01:48:40,188
They can't control the plane, Engines
are failing and they're losing fuel,

1002
01:48:40,291 --> 01:48:42,384
There must be something
we can do to help them,

1003
01:48:42,494 --> 01:48:46,897
- Is that our airstrip strike team?
- Yeah, Why?

1004
01:48:46,998 --> 01:48:49,193
I just had a wild idea,

1005
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:52,133
Time is critical,
Start turning north,

1006
01:48:52,237 --> 01:48:55,331
- You'll get more details en route,
- Yes, sir,

1007
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:57,738
Change of orders acknowledged,

1008
01:49:02,680 --> 01:49:08,482
Try to hold your heading, sir,
They'll rejoin in about 25 minutes,

1009
01:49:08,586 --> 01:49:09,780
All right,

1010
01:49:09,888 --> 01:49:11,913
- We know it's risky,
- Understood,

1011
01:49:12,023 --> 01:49:14,514
But we are all out of options,

1012
01:49:16,728 --> 01:49:18,423
Yeah, baby?

1013
01:49:18,496 --> 01:49:21,829
It'll be okay,
Everything's gonna work,

1014
01:49:37,348 --> 01:49:39,714
Concerned Americans have gathered
at the White House,,,

1015
01:49:39,818 --> 01:49:42,218
to await word on the president
and his family,

1016
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:44,447
But CNN has learned
that "Air Force One",,,

1017
01:49:44,522 --> 01:49:47,923
is severely crippled
and virtually unlandable,

1018
01:49:48,026 --> 01:49:51,257
Sources report that the first family
is still trapped on board,

1019
01:49:51,362 --> 01:49:55,389
And a daring midair rescue operation
is said to be underway,

1020
01:49:58,136 --> 01:50:00,570
"Air Force One,"this is "Liberty 2-4"
approaching on your left side,

1021
01:50:00,672 --> 01:50:03,163
- Do you read?
- "Air Force One," Loud and clear,

1022
01:50:03,274 --> 01:50:06,971
Gibbs, they're here,
Get the door,

1023
01:50:07,078 --> 01:50:10,741
- We'll need 10,000 feet and 200 knots,
- We've got to get her slowed down,

1024
01:50:13,051 --> 01:50:16,418
"Air Force One"and "Liberty 2-4,"
this is "AWACS Blue Star,"

1025
01:50:16,521 --> 01:50:19,081
We have you in radar contact,

1026
01:50:31,302 --> 01:50:34,066
"Liberty 2-4,"
they're almost out of fuel,

1027
01:50:34,205 --> 01:50:35,604
Roger,

1028
01:50:35,707 --> 01:50:37,868
"Air Force One,"keep the wings level,

1029
01:50:37,976 --> 01:50:41,776
If the engines fail, sacriice altitude
to maintain airspeed,

1030
01:50:47,685 --> 01:50:49,118
Ready!

1031
01:50:52,357 --> 01:50:54,917
Back up, Easy,

1032
01:50:55,026 --> 01:50:58,291
"Air Force One,"come left, six,

1033
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,868
- How's my speed?
- It's good, See if you can hold it,

1034
01:51:05,970 --> 01:51:09,599
A little more left, sir,
Three, two, stop,

1035
01:51:19,751 --> 01:51:21,946
Take my arm! Pull me in!

1036
01:51:23,888 --> 01:51:26,288
Come on! Come on!

1037
01:51:32,764 --> 01:51:34,391
Good,

1038
01:51:37,502 --> 01:51:39,936
"Liberty," locked in,
Where's the president?

1039
01:51:40,038 --> 01:51:42,233
Up in the cockpit,

1040
01:51:53,418 --> 01:51:57,149
- We lost another engine,
- "Liberty," we lost another engine,

1041
01:51:57,288 --> 01:51:58,687
"Liberty 2-4," Acknowledged,

1042
01:52:00,358 --> 01:52:01,848
Sir, time to go,

1043
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:06,590
- Who's gonna fly the plane?
- I'll take care of that, sir, Got it,

1044
01:52:06,698 --> 01:52:08,256
Go!

1045
01:52:08,366 --> 01:52:10,994
Ramp to pilot,
Second P, J,'s on the way,

1046
01:52:21,212 --> 01:52:24,443
- Mr, President, this way!
- My family first,

1047
01:52:24,515 --> 01:52:28,042
- Sir, I have orders to take you off,
- Them first,

1048
01:52:31,089 --> 01:52:33,887
"Blue Star,"the third parajumper
is boarding "Air Force One,"

1049
01:52:33,992 --> 01:52:37,450
- Standing by for recovery,
- Roger, Moving into receiver position,

1050
01:52:41,666 --> 01:52:44,635
- Dad?
- You'll be all right, honey,

1051
01:52:44,736 --> 01:52:47,068
- Promise?
- Promise,

1052
01:52:47,171 --> 01:52:49,002
Close your eyes,

1053
01:52:49,107 --> 01:52:51,575
You can do it,
Just hold on tight,

1054
01:52:59,651 --> 01:53:00,879
She's okay,

1055
01:53:06,324 --> 01:53:09,657
- Hang on!
- Ramp to pilot, We got her!

1056
01:53:15,867 --> 01:53:17,835
I'm right behind you,

1057
01:53:31,716 --> 01:53:33,616
Hang on, Good,

1058
01:53:33,718 --> 01:53:37,381
- You're next, sir,
- Him next, He's wounded,

1059
01:53:37,488 --> 01:53:40,651
- You go,
- Come on, Shep, Come on, pal,

1060
01:53:46,698 --> 01:53:48,393
We've lost another engine,

1061
01:53:54,038 --> 01:53:58,475
You're sinking too fast, We only
have time for one more retrieval,

1062
01:54:00,812 --> 01:54:03,781
We're passing 3,000 feet,
Impact in less than two minutes,

1063
01:54:03,881 --> 01:54:06,782
Get the president out of there!

1064
01:54:06,884 --> 01:54:08,681
Right here,

1065
01:54:08,786 --> 01:54:11,311
Easy there,

1066
01:54:11,456 --> 01:54:13,253
He's on,

1067
01:54:13,391 --> 01:54:17,293
- Get your arms ready, It's time to go,
- What about the other team?

1068
01:54:17,428 --> 01:54:21,091
There's no time,
I can only take one more,

1069
01:54:21,199 --> 01:54:23,099
No! We're all going!

1070
01:54:23,201 --> 01:54:27,069
That's impossible, sir,
I have to take you,

1071
01:54:27,171 --> 01:54:30,629
It's time to get you off this plane,
Go, sir,

1072
01:54:30,742 --> 01:54:32,300
Go!

1073
01:54:33,911 --> 01:54:35,742
Please go!

1074
01:54:45,189 --> 01:54:46,656
It was you?

1075
01:55:01,005 --> 01:55:04,168
- Give me the strap!
- I trusted you with my life,

1076
01:55:11,082 --> 01:55:14,210
We have to release the cable,
We're descending from 1200 feet,

1077
01:55:16,154 --> 01:55:18,884
I'm getting off this plane!

1078
01:55:33,171 --> 01:55:34,502
Seven hundred!

1079
01:55:37,508 --> 01:55:38,805
Five hundred!

1080
01:55:38,910 --> 01:55:40,878
We have to pull up!

1081
01:56:09,607 --> 01:56:12,405
"Blue Star,"
"Air Force One"is down,

1082
01:56:12,510 --> 01:56:15,104
I repeat,
"Air Force One"is down,

1083
01:56:15,213 --> 01:56:17,841
"Liberty 2-4,"
