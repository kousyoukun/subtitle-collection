Demo set

7
00:04:03,254 --> 00:04:04,580
Let's move

8
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:19,229
Clear

9
00:04:36,524 --> 00:04:39,489
Low Boy, this is Black Cat

10
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,288
ETA Romeo, L-Z-one-niner

11
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:43,887
We are hot, Copy

12
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:49,059
Come on, Get out there! Go, go!

13
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:52,736
Come on

14
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,612
Get in!

15
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:03,679
Cover! I'm on the roof!

16
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,948
Go!

17
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:21,769
This is Low Boy, Package is wrapped

18
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,256


19
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:39,816
Ladies and gentlemen

20
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:44,414
three weeks ago, Russian and American special forces

21
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:49,848
apprehended the self-proclaimed leader of Kazakhstan, General Ivan Radek

22
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,933
His nuclear arsenal could have brought the world

23
00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:07,634
But thanks to the support of one of the world's greatest leaders

24
00:06:08,246 --> 00:06:11,745
Radek is now in prison

25
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:18,207
Today we are honoring this brave man

26
00:06:19,553 --> 00:06:22,288
Ladies and gentlemen, my friend

27
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:25,390
the president of the United States of America

28
00:06:40,878 --> 00:06:44,878
The dead remember our indifference, The dead remember our silence

29
00:06:46,716 --> 00:06:49,077
I came here tonight to be congratulated

30
00:06:50,387 --> 00:06:52,851
But today when I visited the Red Cross camps

31
00:06:53,256 --> 00:06:58,758
overwhelmed by the flood of refugees, fleeing from the horror of Kazakhstan

32
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:03,367
I realized I don't deserve to be congratulated, none of us do

33
00:07:03,368 --> 00:07:04,660
- What's he doing? - That's not the speech

34
00:07:06,404 --> 00:07:07,737
The truth is

35
00:07:07,738 --> 00:07:09,906
we acted too late

36
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:14,942
Only when our own national security was threatened did we act

37
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:20,542
Radek's regime murdered over 200, 000 men, women and children

38
00:07:20,686 --> 00:07:26,085
and we watched it on TV, We let it happen, People were being slaughtered

39
00:07:26,157 --> 00:07:28,060
for over a year

40
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:32,561
We issued economic sanctions and hid behind the rhetoric of diplomacy

41
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:36,632
How dare we? The dead remember

42
00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:42,473
Real peace, is not just the absence of conflict, it's the presence of justice

43
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:47,909
Tonight I come to you with a pledge to change America's policy

44
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:53,047
Never again, will I allow our political self - interest

45
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:57,152
to deter us from doing what we know to be morally right

46
00:07:57,592 --> 00:08:00,317
Atrocity and terror are not political weapons

47
00:08:00,697 --> 00:08:02,831
And to those who would use them

48
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:06,330
your day is over

49
00:08:08,299 --> 00:08:10,467
We will never negotiate

50
00:08:11,341 --> 00:08:15,068
We will no longer tolerate and we will no longer be afraid

51
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:20,506
It's your turn to be afraid

52
00:08:56,657 --> 00:08:58,291
The Russian was a nice touch

53
00:08:58,292 --> 00:09:00,794
Tell my mother, She wanted me to study French

54
00:09:00,795 --> 00:09:02,142
Do you know what you committed us to?

55
00:09:02,143 --> 00:09:02,724
I know exactly what I committed us to

56
00:09:11,273 --> 00:09:14,342
Gentlemen, welcome to "Air Force One,"

57
00:09:14,343 --> 00:09:17,211
Please present your equipment for inspection

58
00:09:17,212 --> 00:09:19,107
We were just inspected at the gate

59
00:09:19,481 --> 00:09:22,050
This plane carries the president of the United States

60
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:24,109
I understand, I'm terribly sorry

61
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:28,584
Please place your thumb on the ID pad

62
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:39,101
Access cleared

63
00:09:55,121 --> 00:09:58,415
Hello, I'm Melanie Mitchell, deputy press secretary

64
00:09:58,457 --> 00:09:59,681
- I'll be taking you in from here, - Oh, Miss Mitchell

65
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:03,613
It is so nice to finally meet you in person

66
00:10:03,614 --> 00:10:05,946
The president and I were delighted we could accommodate your news crew

67
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:07,958
So, if you boys are all cleared?

68
00:10:08,385 --> 00:10:12,538
The president's on a very tight schedule so this is how it works

69
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:14,619
During the flight, two members of your crew

70
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,800
will be allowed outside the press area for filming

71
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,979
You'll get exactly 10 minutes with the president, 20 with the crew

72
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,122
Gary, the president is ready to take Congress on

73
00:10:29,123 --> 00:10:30,959
He's not gonna kiss their ass for each vote

74
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,822
Let them vote us down and stand on their record

75
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,657
Yeah, I'm with him now, I'll call you from the plane

76
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:40,664
- What did they say about the speech? - Your speech is leading the news

77
00:10:40,703 --> 00:10:42,638
They're calling it the "Be Afraid" speech

78
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:43,839
Good

79
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,886
With all due respect, next time you want to make

80
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,324
a major policy departure, you might want to discuss it

81
00:10:48,325 --> 00:10:50,388
with your national security advisor first

82
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:53,997
- We did discuss it, Jack, - We discussed it

83
00:10:53,998 --> 00:10:56,466
in private, which is where I thought it would remain

84
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:59,319
Now it's public, Now it's policy

85
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,892
Get behind it

86
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:04,662
The allies are going to be very upset they weren't consulted about this

87
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:07,127
It might come back and bite us in the ass in November

88
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:11,035
It's the right thing to do, You know it

89
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:14,538
There goes the neighborhood

90
00:11:15,774 --> 00:11:18,204
If you'd like, we have time for a quick tour

91
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:19,908
- We'd be delighted, - Good

92
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,481
Andrei, Boris

93
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,047
Follow me

94
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,519
Ahead of this staff cabin is Secret Service, Right here

95
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,053
Never try to go past them without an escort or you'll be very sorry

96
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:32,983
- Hello - Hi

97
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,059
Thanks for the warning

98
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,521
Here we have our in-flight offices

99
00:12:04,628 --> 00:12:06,623
A lot of the plane's features are classified

100
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:09,472
But I can tell you it's bullet-resistant

101
00:12:09,473 --> 00:12:13,142
and it's even protected against the pulse of a nuclear blast

102
00:12:13,143 --> 00:12:15,470
I'm not sure that's very comforting

103
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,237
Upstairs is the cockpit along with the most advanced communications center

104
00:12:20,718 --> 00:12:23,765
on or above the face of the earth

105
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:25,244
We could run the whole country from here

106
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,085
Or even a war if we had to

107
00:12:27,086 --> 00:12:30,119
Just last week, the president called the shuttle astronauts from there

108
00:12:30,756 --> 00:12:33,992
The president's arriving, They should take their seats

109
00:12:33,993 --> 00:12:35,026
Right away

110
00:12:35,027 --> 00:12:38,018
I'll get out of here and let you all get some sleep

111
00:12:52,513 --> 00:12:56,137
- Mr.President, welcome aboard, - Hey, Danny, How are you?

112
00:12:56,138 --> 00:12:58,284
Mr.President!

113
00:12:58,285 --> 00:13:01,477
Change in plan, Danny, Let's go to Barbados

114
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,891
Anything you want, You're the president

115
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:05,320
Boy, I wish

116
00:13:05,727 --> 00:13:07,779
- Mr.President, - Mr.Gibbs, where's my bunch?

117
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,964
Ballet ran late, They'll be here in five minutes

118
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:13,186
- Lewis, you tape the game? - It was a real squeaker, sir

119
00:13:13,187 --> 00:13:16,003
Don't brief me on it, I wanted to watch it, for Christ's sake

120
00:13:17,507 --> 00:13:19,572
We'll be underway in about 30 minutes, sir

121
00:13:20,043 --> 00:13:21,232
Mr.President

122
00:13:21,912 --> 00:13:24,112
- Could you put the game on now? - Yeah, Jack?

123
00:13:24,113 --> 00:13:26,372
The Iraqis have mobilized two armored brigades toward. . .

124
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,851
Just got it, Give me 15 minutes, Get the guys together

125
00:13:30,854 --> 00:13:33,523
"Repel them, Make them relinquish the ball,"

126
00:13:33,524 --> 00:13:36,459
- Did you hear about Notre Dame? - Don't, Don't tell me the score

127
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,128
- Great game, - Mr.President

128
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:40,597
We need to strategize, smooth some things out politically

129
00:13:40,598 --> 00:13:42,433
- What was that? - It's not so important

130
00:13:42,434 --> 00:13:45,069
- Damage control, What if. . . - Give me a minute alone

131
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,571
What if a "high-ranking White House official". . .

132
00:13:47,572 --> 00:13:49,137
Just give me a few moments alone

133
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,944
A "high - ranking official" were to qualify what you said last night?

134
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:55,043
Drop it, Do yourself a favor

135
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:57,273
It's policy, Drop it

136
00:14:00,284 --> 00:14:02,786
I told them you'd give them a sound bite about life in the White House

137
00:14:02,787 --> 00:14:04,356
There is no life in the White House

138
00:14:04,357 --> 00:14:08,547
You said it, The president needs some time alone

139
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:11,465
14-13 Michigan!

140
00:14:11,466 --> 00:14:13,725
All right, Mr.President!

141
00:14:16,838 --> 00:14:20,197
That wasn't you napping during the performance, was it, Tom?

142
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:21,572
No, ma'am, It was very enjoyable

143
00:14:22,443 --> 00:14:26,441
Alice, you can finish it on the plane, Let's not keep your father waiting

144
00:14:26,442 --> 00:14:28,543
Try and smile, sweetheart, Okay?

145
00:14:28,979 --> 00:14:32,706
- Alice, one picture, please! - Thank you very much

146
00:14:41,492 --> 00:14:44,017
Great, something from Tom

147
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:45,731
Shh, Daddy's asleep

148
00:14:49,573 --> 00:14:51,764
How was the ballet?

149
00:14:52,109 --> 00:14:53,776
It was great!

150
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:59,208
You trying to kill me? Wait it really good? Did you enjoy it?

151
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:02,776
Did you love it? Men in tights? Did you hear my speech?

152
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:03,888
- Yeah, - Yeah?

153
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:07,813
- You're gonna get yourself reelected, - That's what I keep telling them

154
00:15:13,323 --> 00:15:16,326
This is the aircraft commander, We'll take to the runway in a moment

155
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:18,902
- Are you guys comfortable? - Yes, very

156
00:15:19,305 --> 00:15:21,440
This is the information used in the VIP

157
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:22,308
thank you

158
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:23,806
You're welcome

159
00:15:36,624 --> 00:15:38,883
Pass interference, That's cheating

160
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:41,926
- Only if they get caught, - Dad!

161
00:15:42,163 --> 00:15:43,990
The way of the world, kiddo

162
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:53,006
Why didn't you take me with you when you went to the refugee camp today?

163
00:15:55,611 --> 00:15:58,473
For one thing, it's not 100 percent secure

164
00:16:06,606 --> 00:16:09,615
Come on, Dad, It's not like I don't see it on the news

165
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,687
It's different on the news

166
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:15,487
All I'm saying is I'm ready for things you don't think I'm ready for

167
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,462
Maybe I'm not ready

168
00:16:17,988 --> 00:16:20,048
I'm 12 years old, Dad!

169
00:16:20,058 --> 00:16:23,622
In the caveman days, I'd be having children of my own

170
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:27,307
That's what we call progress, You're missing the best part of the game

171
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:29,875
God!

172
00:16:32,518 --> 00:16:35,551
We're so looking forward to seeing you

173
00:16:37,223 --> 00:16:41,148
- She is so anxious to grow up, - I know, She's. . .

174
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:44,560
Yes, the both of us, Okay, Bye, bye

175
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:50,059
Well, she couldn't stay your little girl forever, Jim

176
00:16:50,237 --> 00:16:54,737
I was hoping it would last till she was 14 or 15

177
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:56,992
Or 50

178
00:16:58,346 --> 00:17:00,241
They hated your speech, didn't they?

179
00:17:00,982 --> 00:17:03,717
They're afraid we won't have the guts to back it up

180
00:17:03,718 --> 00:17:06,716
And, then, if we do, it'll be political suicide

181
00:17:06,722 --> 00:17:08,822
Remember our first campaign?

182
00:17:09,258 --> 00:17:11,350
- In the House? - Yeah

183
00:17:11,675 --> 00:17:15,144
- Downstate, driving around with. . . - Who was that kid, our volunteer?

184
00:17:15,145 --> 00:17:17,713
- Henry, - Henry with the convertible

185
00:17:17,714 --> 00:17:20,357
- With the broken top, - And the snow coming in

186
00:17:20,358 --> 00:17:23,132
We were the only three people who thought you could win that

187
00:17:23,587 --> 00:17:27,348
You didn't give a damn, You knew what needed to be done and you did it

188
00:17:27,778 --> 00:17:31,379
And you spoke from your heart, That's what I heard tonight

189
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:36,429
Well, it felt good

190
00:17:37,668 --> 00:17:39,836
I'll bet it did

191
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:50,193
Sorry to interrupt, Everybody's assembled, sir

192
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:57,476
United States "Air Force One,"

193
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:02,041
It is an honor to clear you for immediate takeoff on runway 2- 5

194
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:04,217
"Air Force One" cleared for takeoff

195
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:06,579
Thank you for your hospitality, Moscow

196
00:19:00,645 --> 00:19:04,171
In Moscow tonight, President Marshall defended

197
00:19:04,172 --> 00:19:05,588
the military action against the Radek regime

198
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:09,059
an act the administration had been calling a one-time intervention

199
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,093
But in a rare display of emotion

200
00:19:11,094 --> 00:19:14,930
the president alluded to a change in US foreign policy when he stated

201
00:19:14,931 --> 00:19:18,567
that America will no longer tolerate any terrorist government

202
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:26,972
These are two of Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard brigades

203
00:19:27,141 --> 00:19:29,807
He knows we're watching, knows we'll retaliate

204
00:19:29,808 --> 00:19:31,811
Why the hell is he sending tanks to the border?

205
00:19:31,812 --> 00:19:33,973
Could be a response to your speech, Mr.President

206
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:36,777
- Maybe he's got a son-in-law up there, - Very funny

207
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:39,242
I think there's one or two he hasn't shot yet

208
00:19:39,655 --> 00:19:40,788
What does State have to say?

209
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:43,952
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise

210
00:19:44,626 --> 00:19:47,386
Let's not waste more time, Send the "Nimitz" back in

211
00:19:52,335 --> 00:19:54,199
- Gibbs, - Guys

212
00:20:04,014 --> 00:20:06,440
- Sleeping on the job? - No, sir

213
00:20:20,832 --> 00:20:26,470
Hey, guys, This is a special report of the Panel in Miami

214
00:20:26,472 --> 00:20:28,568
- Take a look at them, - Thank you

215
00:21:28,072 --> 00:21:30,263
Steward, there's smoke in the cabin

216
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:33,677
Everybody move to the back of the plane, Now! Please!

217
00:21:33,678 --> 00:21:36,176
Smoke! Notify the cockpit!

218
00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:51,221
Mr.President, stay back

219
00:21:55,702 --> 00:21:57,130
Everybody down!

220
00:22:07,681 --> 00:22:10,281
Code red! We have a code red! I repeat, Shots fired on board

221
00:22:11,586 --> 00:22:14,221
Code red acknowledged, Lock that door now

222
00:22:14,222 --> 00:22:16,822
Flight control, this is "Air Force One" declaring emergency

223
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:20,171
Cover us!

224
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,660
Stay back

225
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,160
Move up! I'll cover you

226
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:28,359
Go! Go!

227
00:22:29,238 --> 00:22:31,106
- What's going on? - Shots fired, sir

228
00:22:31,107 --> 00:22:33,765
- What about my family? - We're handling it, sir

229
00:22:34,011 --> 00:22:36,202
Boy Scout coming out! Cover!

230
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,614
- Give us cover! - Daddy?

231
00:22:38,615 --> 00:22:39,682
Alice, get back!

232
00:22:39,683 --> 00:22:40,611
Daddy

233
00:22:40,617 --> 00:22:42,785
Alice, get down!

234
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,423
- Take him around here, - Get down

235
00:22:46,424 --> 00:22:51,039
This is "Air Force One,"We are code red, Shots fired on board

236
00:22:51,262 --> 00:22:53,623
Request emergency assistance, ETA 15 minutes

237
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:55,098
Acknowledged, We are scrambling our fighters, Emergency equipment

238
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:59,912
will be standing by

239
00:23:09,699 --> 00:23:11,283
Get him to the escape pod!

240
00:23:11,284 --> 00:23:13,315
Boy Scout is headed to the vault

241
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,147
The football! The football!

242
00:23:19,827 --> 00:23:23,861
Get him around here, Get him down to the pod!

243
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:26,833
Don't move!

244
00:23:28,002 --> 00:23:29,897
Go to the President

245
00:23:32,074 --> 00:23:34,375
- They're on us, - Where's my family?

246
00:23:34,376 --> 00:23:38,268
- Get in the pod, sir, Get in! - What about my family?

247
00:23:44,187 --> 00:23:48,123
"Air Force One," landing runway 0- 9, I repeat, runway 0- 9

248
00:23:48,124 --> 00:23:51,760
Roger, Turning to heading 1- 8- 5, Descending to 5, 000 feet

249
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,248
Quickly, he ran into the escape capsule

250
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:27,392
Ramstein, this is "Air Force One,"

251
00:24:27,393 --> 00:24:29,378
Emergency pod has been deployed, I repeat

252
00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:32,071
- The emergency pod has been deployed, - Ramstein tower, acknowledge

253
00:24:32,072 --> 00:24:34,706
We are picking up the homing beacon and deploying search and rescue

254
00:24:40,815 --> 00:24:43,587
- Is the locking ready to look at? - Just about, sir

255
00:24:43,588 --> 00:24:46,491
- Has General Northwood arrived? - Yes, he has

256
00:24:48,456 --> 00:24:51,162
- Give me an update, - Madam Vice President, this way

257
00:24:51,163 --> 00:24:53,834
- We'll avoid the press, - Is the president secure?

258
00:24:53,835 --> 00:24:55,858
Not yet, The recovery team will have him very soon

259
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:11,914
"Air Force One", this is Halo Flight Lead, you are under escort

260
00:25:11,915 --> 00:25:16,790
All airspace has been cleared, Alert force has been mobilized

261
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:17,812
- Is everyone here? - We're working on it

262
00:25:18,556 --> 00:25:21,359
How did this happen? How did they get "Air Force One"?

263
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,187
Gentlemen, Mr.Secretary

264
00:25:26,397 --> 00:25:30,067
Ramstein tower, we are at ten mile. . . Final coming in red hot

265
00:25:30,068 --> 00:25:34,864
Roger,"Air Force One," Wind is 0-niner-0 at 12, You are clear to land

266
00:25:43,482 --> 00:25:44,876
They landed

267
00:25:46,452 --> 00:25:49,791
Get down! Now!

268
00:25:54,027 --> 00:25:55,489
Open the door!

269
00:26:08,142 --> 00:26:10,333
Open! Open the door!

270
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:13,747
No matter what happens, we land this aircraft, Is that understood?

271
00:26:16,051 --> 00:26:18,515
Come on, Flaps 30

272
00:26:18,554 --> 00:26:20,278
Flaps 30

273
00:26:52,324 --> 00:26:53,889
- No! - Get the fuck in the air!

274
00:26:58,897 --> 00:27:01,122
Now! Take this plane up!

275
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:04,898
Up! Up!

276
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,304
Take it up!

277
00:27:13,113 --> 00:27:16,111
Get this plane back in the air now or you die

278
00:27:17,918 --> 00:27:19,210
Get up now!

279
00:27:48,952 --> 00:27:50,779
No! Jesus!

280
00:28:56,858 --> 00:28:59,027
Contact those F-15s

281
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:02,026
I want them to keep "Air Force One" in visual contact

282
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:05,550
- What are our airborne scenarios? - There are no airborne scenarios

283
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:09,105
Then we'd better start generating them, They better be good and better work

284
00:29:09,106 --> 00:29:10,940
How long can they stay up there with the fuel they have?

285
00:29:10,941 --> 00:29:13,910
- That's a question of airspeed, wind, - Altitude

286
00:29:13,911 --> 00:29:17,480
We need an "Air Force One" pilot, Any educated guesses where they might go?

287
00:29:17,481 --> 00:29:21,680
- Iraq, Libya, Algeria, - Those are guesses, but not educated

288
00:29:21,681 --> 00:29:23,238
Notify our allies, We'll need secure airspace

289
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:25,207
- Can we keep that under wraps? - We'll do our best

290
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:28,555
Try and relax, Kathryn, I'm in charge here

291
00:29:28,693 --> 00:29:31,555
I don't know, It seems to me they're in charge

292
00:29:38,637 --> 00:29:41,135
We have to go home

293
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:47,002


294
00:29:48,831 --> 00:29:51,133
- Don't hurt me, - Go

295
00:29:51,134 --> 00:29:52,767
Go

296
00:29:56,023 --> 00:29:57,747
Where the President?

297
00:29:58,292 --> 00:30:00,790
He is not the plane

298
00:30:01,362 --> 00:30:03,621
He ran into the cabin to escape to escape

299
00:30:19,215 --> 00:30:22,942
Moscow police found six members of a Russian TV news crew murdered

300
00:30:23,052 --> 00:30:26,119
They are allowed to board Air Force One

301
00:30:26,122 --> 00:30:27,118
My God

302
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,955
Tell me it's not that easy

303
00:30:29,592 --> 00:30:32,390
No, You would have to generate fake ID photos, Fingerprints

304
00:30:32,391 --> 00:30:34,059
Could be with help from Moscow

305
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,859
How would they get weapons on board?

306
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:38,668
There's no way to get weapons on board "Air Force One," It's impossible

307
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:42,202
There are enough weapons on board to take Panama, but who has access to them?

308
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,069
You think someone on the plane helped them?

309
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:46,468
What if somebody did and they're still on the plane?

310
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,912
Who do they trust up there? Who do we trust?

311
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:55,114
Madam Vice President, Mr.Secretary

312
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:59,835
All compromised nuclear launch codes have been cancelled, New codes are active

313
00:30:59,836 --> 00:31:04,204
Ramstein, the president's escape pod has been located

314
00:31:04,205 --> 00:31:06,654
We're honing in at 2-8-5 degrees

315
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:15,001
There it is, Ramstein, we have a strong signal

316
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:17,670
ETA, two minutes

317
00:31:26,187 --> 00:31:28,287
Where is the wife and daughter?

318
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:40,232
Get out

319
00:31:41,571 --> 00:31:43,534
Where is my husband?

320
00:31:45,842 --> 00:31:49,705
He had fled, The coward chose to save himself

321
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:55,908
But one can always strike a bargain

322
00:31:56,721 --> 00:31:58,786
You listen to me

323
00:31:59,523 --> 00:32:02,988
I don't know who you are or what you want

324
00:32:03,462 --> 00:32:06,230
but you will never get it

325
00:32:06,231 --> 00:32:09,161
He will not negotiate

326
00:32:10,469 --> 00:32:12,606
Really?

327
00:32:12,904 --> 00:32:17,006
His wife, His daughter

328
00:32:17,176 --> 00:32:19,901
A man could not live with himself

329
00:32:20,546 --> 00:32:25,581
And it would be such bad politics

330
00:32:31,258 --> 00:32:34,086
I think he'll negotiate

331
00:32:45,273 --> 00:32:47,408
The escape pod is visually acquired

332
00:32:47,409 --> 00:32:52,512
Location of Ramstein is 2-8-4 degrees, Twelve miles out

333
00:33:45,372 --> 00:33:47,301
Recover all weapons to the

334
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:50,334
Renevski, and then search again

335
00:33:50,578 --> 00:33:52,575
You round the first guard

336
00:34:07,062 --> 00:34:08,820
I went to search the following

337
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:23,035
Okay

338
00:34:50,009 --> 00:34:53,406
It's "Air Force One," They want to talk to the vice president

339
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:06,417
Hello, Can you hear me?

340
00:35:09,062 --> 00:35:14,881
This is the vice president of the United States, To whom am I speaking?

341
00:35:14,882 --> 00:35:17,768
This is the person who controls "Air Force One,"

342
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:21,533
The world's most secure aircraft

343
00:35:23,178 --> 00:35:24,936
What is it that you want?

344
00:35:26,081 --> 00:35:27,771
We'll get to that

345
00:35:29,651 --> 00:35:31,785
- I want to speak to the First Lady, - No

346
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,725
I would like to determine the safety of their

347
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,509
The president is safe, But then you must know that

348
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:44,466
He ran from here like a whipped dog

349
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:48,371
I'm sure you can't wait for him to get back to making the decisions

350
00:35:48,372 --> 00:35:53,373
so you can stop sweating through that silk blouse of yours

351
00:35:57,115 --> 00:36:00,375
What is the condition of the people on board?

352
00:36:00,752 --> 00:36:02,146
Some are dead

353
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:05,721
What are your intentions?

354
00:36:06,491 --> 00:36:10,821
What arrogance to think you could ever understand my intentions

355
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:14,327
I want to understand what it is that you want

356
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,531
What do I want?

357
00:36:17,303 --> 00:36:22,497
When Mother Russia becomes one great nation again

358
00:36:23,143 --> 00:36:29,009
when the capitalists are dragged from the Kremlin

359
00:36:29,683 --> 00:36:35,656
when our enemies run and hide in fear at the mention of our name

360
00:36:35,657 --> 00:36:40,351
and America begs our forgiveness

361
00:36:40,395 --> 00:36:44,497
on that great day of deliverance

362
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:47,524
you will know what I want

363
00:36:49,338 --> 00:36:54,253
We can give you a forum for your grievances, We can contact the Russian government

364
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,779
But you must understand that it will take some time

365
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,127
Really? When you talk to the president

366
00:37:00,162 --> 00:37:07,028
you might remind him that I am holding his wife, his daughter, his chief of staff, his national security advisor

367
00:37:07,029 --> 00:37:11,493
his classified papers and his baseball glove

368
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:16,721
If he wants them back, he will prevail upon the puppet regime in Moscow

369
00:37:16,722 --> 00:37:20,404
to release General Radek

370
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:24,432
Fifty for one, It's a good deal

371
00:37:24,433 --> 00:37:26,642
How's your blouse?

372
00:37:29,181 --> 00:37:32,784
What assurances do I have that you'll keep your word?

373
00:37:32,785 --> 00:37:37,649
I'll wait for confirmation that General Radek has been released

374
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:40,591
Until then

375
00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:45,023
I will execute a hostage every half an hour

376
00:37:47,735 --> 00:37:50,096
You have my word

377
00:37:52,006 --> 00:37:55,539
You must understand that we. . . Hello?

378
00:37:55,644 --> 00:37:57,277
They're off!

379
00:38:01,049 --> 00:38:04,551
Damn it! Nobody does this, to the United States

380
00:38:04,552 --> 00:38:08,390
The president will get back his glove and play catch with this guy's balls

381
00:38:08,391 --> 00:38:11,292
We can't do anything in half an hour, We need more time

382
00:38:11,293 --> 00:38:14,922
He's a zealot, Tough to negotiate with, All you can do is wear them down

383
00:38:14,923 --> 00:38:16,295
Mr.Secretary!

384
00:38:24,841 --> 00:38:29,808
We found the escape pod, It's empty

385
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,243
So where's the president?

386
00:38:38,456 --> 00:38:46,093
I think we have to acknowledge the possibility, that the president may be dead

387
00:38:48,467 --> 00:38:50,658
Why do they not say?

388
00:38:51,971 --> 00:38:55,732
Diversion, Try to buy some time

389
00:38:55,909 --> 00:38:57,229
It could have happened in a cross fire

390
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,744
and they're afraid we'll retaliate

391
00:38:58,745 --> 00:39:02,147
Damn right, we'll retaliate, We'll release Radek into the atmosphere

392
00:39:02,148 --> 00:39:06,419
It doesn't add up, That terrorist knew we'd recover the pod in short order

393
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,588
He expected that we'd be talking to Marshall

394
00:39:08,589 --> 00:39:12,092
Let's not bury him yet, He could still be alive in that plane

395
00:39:12,093 --> 00:39:14,895
Let's not forget this president is a Medal of Honor winner

396
00:39:14,896 --> 00:39:18,766
In Vietnam, he flew more helicopter missions than any man in my command

397
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:20,434
He knows how to fight

398
00:39:20,435 --> 00:39:23,170
Then he's taking a terrible chance with his life

399
00:39:23,171 --> 00:39:26,863
The element of surprise is a formidable advantage in combat

400
00:39:27,009 --> 00:39:29,878
If he's up there, he's the best chance that we have

401
00:39:29,879 --> 00:39:32,547
That pod was designed for a reason, General

402
00:39:32,548 --> 00:39:35,615
He has no right to take chances with his life

403
00:40:51,801 --> 00:40:54,469
Everything is Nothing

404
00:41:39,853 --> 00:41:42,355
What does the psych profile say? How far will he go?

405
00:41:42,356 --> 00:41:44,593
He's a Radek loyalist

406
00:41:44,594 --> 00:41:46,185
That tells us all we need to know, doesn't it?

407
00:41:46,427 --> 00:41:49,363
He'll see this thing through to the last hostage or his own death

408
00:41:49,364 --> 00:41:52,232
Release this bastard and Central Asia will go up in flames!

409
00:41:52,233 --> 00:41:53,667
I'm aware of that

410
00:41:53,668 --> 00:41:57,031
Bring back the old Soviet empire under a flag of genocide?

411
00:41:57,105 --> 00:41:59,865
Radek with a nuclear arsenal?

412
00:42:00,276 --> 00:42:03,258
I hate to say this, but 50 people

413
00:42:03,259 --> 00:42:05,495
is a small price to pay to stop that from happening

414
00:42:05,496 --> 00:42:07,048
Even if one of them is the president?

415
00:42:07,049 --> 00:42:11,313
The presidency is bigger than any man, Didn't they teach you that at Yale?

416
00:42:11,314 --> 00:42:14,023
Can't we release him today and pick up the pieces tomorrow?

417
00:42:14,024 --> 00:42:16,025
We caught him before, we'll catch him again

418
00:42:16,026 --> 00:42:18,127
If Petrov releases Radek, his government will fall

419
00:42:18,128 --> 00:42:21,627
I promise you that, Then who's gonna stand up to Radek?

420
00:42:21,666 --> 00:42:24,892
You go to catch him again, you'll find him in Moscow

421
00:42:24,902 --> 00:42:26,556
With respect, Mr.Secretary

422
00:42:26,557 --> 00:42:29,204
we don't need more dramatics, we need options

423
00:42:29,205 --> 00:42:30,935
- It's not an option, - We need a decision

424
00:42:30,936 --> 00:42:32,234
It's not her decision

425
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:35,479
This is a military situation, I'm the secretary of defense

426
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,550
Check your regs, In the absence of the president, the buck stops here

427
00:42:39,551 --> 00:42:42,748
Get the attorney general with a copy of the Constitution

428
00:42:42,749 --> 00:42:45,448
We have. . . Oh, my God! Nineteen minutes

429
00:42:46,459 --> 00:42:49,423
I'm going to consult with President Petrov

430
00:47:06,107 --> 00:47:09,209
Madam Vice President, I'm sorry, I cannot release him

431
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:12,680
We would train, all our military might against this one target

432
00:47:12,681 --> 00:47:15,545
He wouldn't stay at large for long

433
00:47:15,546 --> 00:47:18,219
Maybe so, But millions of lives are hanging in the balance

434
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:20,021
I am trying to save a nation!

435
00:47:20,022 --> 00:47:21,522
As am I

436
00:47:21,523 --> 00:47:25,527
No nation can survive the loss, nor soon replace, a great leader

437
00:47:25,528 --> 00:47:27,129
Let us be pragmatic, Fifty lives means nothing

438
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:30,191
in the grand scheme, What life is not 50

439
00:47:30,192 --> 00:47:31,800
Let me be equally pragmatic

440
00:47:31,801 --> 00:47:34,762
Our president took a great risk to come to your aid

441
00:47:34,763 --> 00:47:37,641
against strong opposition in both parties and among our allies

442
00:47:37,642 --> 00:47:39,776
It would be politically impossible to do so again

443
00:47:39,777 --> 00:47:42,946
If it meant saving his life, I would gladly do it

444
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:47,743
But I would have to know for sure, And you cannot tell me he's alive, can you?

445
00:47:48,387 --> 00:47:50,321
No, Mr.President, I cannot

446
00:47:50,322 --> 00:47:54,856
Then there is nothing I can do, I am truly sorry, Good-bye

447
00:47:58,263 --> 00:48:00,431
Okay, Walter, you and your generals get to work

448
00:48:20,988 --> 00:48:24,680
He told me five years fighting in Afghanistan

449
00:48:26,461 --> 00:48:29,926
To find the murderer, or else you die

450
00:48:46,568 --> 00:48:50,186
Okay, they can't keep the plane in the air indefinitely

451
00:48:50,187 --> 00:48:52,736
There are only four possible landing sites in Kazakhstan

452
00:48:52,737 --> 00:48:54,776
that are still controlled by Radek's forces

453
00:48:54,777 --> 00:48:57,650
We have to go in and take all of them, Can we do it?

454
00:48:57,795 --> 00:48:59,796
I'd rather take my chances in the air

455
00:48:59,797 --> 00:49:02,583
I just looked at the airborne scenarios, They're no good

456
00:49:02,584 --> 00:49:05,744
- Can we do this? - In the time we have? Messy

457
00:49:05,745 --> 00:49:08,905
Three more minutes before they execute the first hostage

458
00:49:08,906 --> 00:49:11,258
You'll have to buy us more time

459
00:49:11,259 --> 00:49:12,892
All right

460
00:49:21,087 --> 00:49:25,189
The telephone from a conference room

461
00:49:49,851 --> 00:49:53,384
You both, come here

462
00:49:56,292 --> 00:49:57,618
Now!

463
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,704
They will transfer the call here

464
00:50:19,417 --> 00:50:21,209
let's just wait

465
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:29,287
Excuse me

466
00:50:31,497 --> 00:50:35,200
Sir, if you will permit me, I am the national security advisor

467
00:50:35,201 --> 00:50:37,130
I'm the man the president would be listening to

468
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:40,338
I believe you are negotiating right now with the vice president

469
00:50:40,339 --> 00:50:44,076
In our system, the vice president is like the queen of England

470
00:50:44,077 --> 00:50:47,300
She can't even get airline tickets without talking

471
00:50:47,301 --> 00:50:50,382
to somebody like me; therefore, let me speak to the White House

472
00:50:50,383 --> 00:50:54,713
I promise you, I'm the one person who can make this all work out

473
00:51:00,862 --> 00:51:02,723
Has he been released?

474
00:51:03,064 --> 00:51:06,934
I've contacted the Russian government, We've set things in motion

475
00:51:06,935 --> 00:51:11,478
But at this point, we have to be realistic, It's going to take more time

476
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,468
More time?

477
00:51:19,883 --> 00:51:23,211
Your national security adviser, was executed

478
00:51:24,053 --> 00:51:29,591
He's a very good negotiator, He bought you another half hour

479
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:43,536
Mrs, Marshall, Alice

480
00:51:43,537 --> 00:51:47,335
If you please, come with me

481
00:52:25,687 --> 00:52:28,222
That's the first time you ever seen a man killed, huh?

482
00:52:28,223 --> 00:52:29,981
Leave her alone

483
00:52:32,194 --> 00:52:36,922
You think I'm a monster? That I would kill this man?

484
00:52:36,923 --> 00:52:42,534
Somebody's son? Somebody's father?

485
00:52:44,307 --> 00:52:47,067
I am somebody's son, too

486
00:52:47,711 --> 00:52:50,573
I have three small children

487
00:52:51,882 --> 00:52:53,982
Does that surprise you?

488
00:52:58,022 --> 00:52:59,154
- Tell her to answer, - Leave her alone!

489
00:53:00,191 --> 00:53:01,323
Shut up!

490
00:53:06,898 --> 00:53:08,827
Why did you kill him?

491
00:53:09,835 --> 00:53:11,935
Because I believe

492
00:53:13,338 --> 00:53:16,764
And when I shoot this man, I know in that instant

493
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,912
how deep was my belief

494
00:53:20,913 --> 00:53:28,642
That I would turn my back on God Himself, for Mother Russia

495
00:53:29,256 --> 00:53:34,450
My doubts, my fears, My own private morality

496
00:53:35,729 --> 00:53:41,685
for this love, Can all behind

497
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:48,008
You know, your father, he has also killed

498
00:53:48,843 --> 00:53:51,698
- Is he a bad man? - That's not true

499
00:53:51,699 --> 00:53:53,144
Why?

500
00:53:53,449 --> 00:53:58,985
Because he does it in a tuxedo with a telephone call and a smart bomb?

501
00:54:00,289 --> 00:54:06,359
You are a monster, And my father is a great man

502
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:09,490
You're nothing like my father

503
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:39,521
What's the goddamn number?

504
00:54:45,004 --> 00:54:48,508
- What city please? - Washington D C, the White House

505
00:54:48,509 --> 00:54:52,334
- Just a moment, Here's the number, - Can you connect me to that number?

506
00:54:52,335 --> 00:54:54,845
- There's a connect fee of one dollar, - Fine

507
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:12,062
White House switchboard, How may I direct your call?

508
00:55:13,035 --> 00:55:14,846
All right, listen, Listen carefully

509
00:55:14,847 --> 00:55:17,563
This is an emergency call from "Air Force One,"

510
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:21,090
This is the president, Connect me to the vice president

511
00:55:21,177 --> 00:55:22,844
Who did you say is calling?

512
00:55:25,883 --> 00:55:29,485
- This is the president! - Right, and I'm the First Lady

513
00:55:29,486 --> 00:55:31,387
Don't cut me off, This is an emergency

514
00:55:31,388 --> 00:55:35,752
The president doesn't call this particular number, so whoever you are. . .

515
00:55:36,027 --> 00:55:41,180
Trace the call, Follow your standard security procedure

516
00:55:42,367 --> 00:55:44,501
Trace the goddamn call!

517
00:55:44,502 --> 00:55:48,661
Okay, sir, You want to make a federal case out of this, fine by me!

518
00:55:56,916 --> 00:55:59,852
Hello, Anyone there?

519
00:55:59,853 --> 00:56:01,111
Don't move

520
00:56:02,255 --> 00:56:05,222
- I traced the call, sir, - Give me the gun

521
00:56:05,223 --> 00:56:07,155
- Are you there? - Slowly

522
00:56:07,594 --> 00:56:08,783
Oh, my God!

523
00:56:09,497 --> 00:56:11,722
I'll put you right through, Mr.President

524
00:56:17,738 --> 00:56:20,065
The switchboard has a call from someone claiming to be the president

525
00:56:20,709 --> 00:56:23,110
She traced it back to the White House satellite account

526
00:56:23,111 --> 00:56:25,112
The caller's gone, but the line is still active

527
00:56:25,113 --> 00:56:26,302
Put it through

528
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:33,262
Listen to me, Listen to me, You know who I am

529
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,585
I'm the president of the United States

530
00:56:36,586 --> 00:56:38,160
- Yes! - Quiet!

531
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:40,244
Don't think that means I don't shoot you

532
00:56:40,245 --> 00:56:42,776
Put your hands behind your head and move

533
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:53,787
This is your lucky day

534
00:56:53,788 --> 00:56:56,702
What more can my people do? Tell the F-15s to fire at the plane?

535
00:56:56,703 --> 00:56:59,650
Even if they tried, we're equipped with tactical countermeasures

536
00:56:59,651 --> 00:57:02,215
- He's talking to us, - What do you mean?

537
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:05,765
I just want you to feel secure, That way no one will get hurt

538
00:57:05,766 --> 00:57:08,260
The computer will fly circles around any missile they fire at us

539
00:57:08,261 --> 00:57:11,663
- And no hit, just a shock wave, - He's telling us what to do

540
00:57:11,664 --> 00:57:14,733
Believe me, all that would happen is that we'd get knocked off our feet

541
00:57:14,734 --> 00:57:17,358
- That's all! - Shut up!

542
00:57:18,861 --> 00:57:20,907
President has been hijacked

543
00:57:20,908 --> 00:57:23,273
- If we're going to act, we must act now, - It's too risky

544
00:57:23,274 --> 00:57:25,411
The president is up there with a gun to his head

545
00:57:25,412 --> 00:57:28,414
He's asking us to do that to "Air Force One"?

546
00:57:28,415 --> 00:57:29,782
He's not asking

547
00:57:29,783 --> 00:57:33,817
Your commander in chief has issued a direct order, Do it!

548
00:57:38,393 --> 00:57:40,959
Are you sure that's what you want me to do?

549
00:57:40,995 --> 00:57:44,966
You heard me, Let's pray it works the way it's supposed to

550
00:57:44,967 --> 00:57:50,644
Boys, give me room, I've been ordered to fire on "Air Force One,"

551
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,584
I'm in position, Missiles are armed

552
00:58:10,061 --> 00:58:12,957
The target is acquired, I have a good lock

553
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,192
God, I hope this works, Fox Three

554
00:58:20,939 --> 00:58:23,073
The abolition of automatic driving

555
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:39,790
"Incoming missile

556
00:58:40,627 --> 00:58:41,919
How's going on?

557
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:45,191
Yankees to fire

558
00:58:45,366 --> 00:58:46,533
I lost control

559
00:58:47,768 --> 00:58:49,595
Computer to take over the driving

560
00:58:52,207 --> 00:58:54,807
"Ready to shoot bait"

561
00:58:59,414 --> 00:59:01,377
"Injection bait"

562
00:59:08,457 --> 00:59:10,284
They are crazy?

563
01:00:14,021 --> 01:00:16,389
This is Marshall

564
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:19,024
- Anyone there? - We're here, Mr.President

565
01:00:19,267 --> 01:00:20,764
Where's my family? Are they safe?

566
01:00:20,836 --> 01:00:23,370
The terrorists claim they're holding them, We can't confirm

567
01:00:23,371 --> 01:00:26,475
Who are they? What do they want?

568
01:00:26,476 --> 01:00:31,031
They're Russian ultranationalist radicals, They want General Radek, released from prison

569
01:00:31,032 --> 01:00:32,075
General Radek

570
01:00:33,282 --> 01:00:36,816
- What are our tactical options? - We're working on that

571
01:00:36,817 --> 01:00:40,089
- But the bastards have us in a corner, - There is no rescue attempt?

572
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:41,884
I ruled out a midair rescue

573
01:00:41,885 --> 01:00:43,459
We can do nothing while the plane's in the air

574
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:45,051
We gotta get this plane on the ground

575
01:00:45,052 --> 01:00:47,061
Take me off the speakerphone

576
01:00:47,297 --> 01:00:48,725
- Where's Bennett? - Mr.President

577
01:00:50,135 --> 01:00:52,225
We cannot release Radek

578
01:00:52,226 --> 01:00:55,884
They're gonna shoot a hostage every half hour until we do

579
01:00:55,907 --> 01:00:57,972
I don't want a plane full of dead people

580
01:00:59,911 --> 01:01:01,703
They shot Jack Doherty

581
01:01:03,516 --> 01:01:04,944
Christ!

582
01:01:05,918 --> 01:01:09,110
We can't give in to their demands, It won't end there

583
01:01:09,188 --> 01:01:11,720
If you die in the plane, does it end there?

584
01:01:11,924 --> 01:01:16,162
We've got a job to do, whatever the cost

585
01:01:16,163 --> 01:01:17,796
Catherine

586
01:01:19,432 --> 01:01:21,497
A piece of biscuit to the rats

587
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:25,703
He'll want a glass of milk

588
01:01:27,275 --> 01:01:29,636
We gotta get this plane on the ground

589
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:41,289
Robards Rloff come back?

590
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:42,684
no

591
01:02:30,209 --> 01:02:32,036
Get the plane on the ground

592
01:02:52,767 --> 01:02:55,765
Below us in the shelter

593
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:58,738
I soon lost patience

594
01:03:36,915 --> 01:03:38,514
"Fuel-control system"

595
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:57,035
I would like to invite you to join us

596
01:03:57,604 --> 01:03:59,965
It is starting to feel a little empty up here

597
01:04:02,242 --> 01:04:04,307
Sit down, Please

598
01:04:07,949 --> 01:04:09,138
"Fuel-control"

599
01:04:11,619 --> 01:04:13,719
Come

600
01:04:28,237 --> 01:04:33,614
Tell me your name again, for the record

601
01:04:33,615 --> 01:04:38,413
Melanie, Melanie Mitchell

602
01:04:39,216 --> 01:04:44,354
You travel often, with the President?

603
01:04:44,355 --> 01:04:45,579
Yes

604
01:04:45,623 --> 01:04:49,190
So you know everyone on the plane?

605
01:04:51,162 --> 01:04:52,852
Yes

606
01:04:54,400 --> 01:05:00,369
I bet they like you, huh? You're a nice person, yes?

607
01:05:04,643 --> 01:05:06,834
I guess so

608
01:05:24,398 --> 01:05:26,429
You tremble

609
01:05:27,601 --> 01:05:29,393
Why are you afraid?

610
01:05:30,504 --> 01:05:36,643
Because I don't wanna die

611
01:05:38,413 --> 01:05:43,415
Tell me, what am I doing at this moment?

612
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:47,082
You're pointing a gun at me

613
01:05:48,057 --> 01:05:49,747
Thank you, Melanie

614
01:05:50,793 --> 01:05:54,520
This is to the secret service agent in the baggage deck

615
01:05:55,666 --> 01:05:57,900
I will count to ten

616
01:05:57,901 --> 01:06:01,935
And if you do not surrender, this nice woman will die

617
01:06:04,442 --> 01:06:05,505
One

618
01:06:05,506 --> 01:06:07,644
- Please don't, - Two

619
01:06:07,645 --> 01:06:10,907
- Don't do this! - Three

620
01:06:10,915 --> 01:06:13,684
- Let me talk to him! - Four

621
01:06:13,685 --> 01:06:15,635
- I beg you, please, - Five

622
01:06:15,636 --> 01:06:17,717
Let me talk to the agent

623
01:06:17,857 --> 01:06:20,185
- Six, - He might listen to me

624
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:21,759
Seven

625
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,553
- I beg you, don't do this, - Eight

626
01:06:24,554 --> 01:06:27,564
- Don't do this, please! - Nine!

627
01:06:27,565 --> 01:06:28,961
No

628
01:06:41,275 --> 01:06:42,999
Oh, God

629
01:06:48,956 --> 01:06:51,951
Let's think about that one for a moment

630
01:06:51,952 --> 01:06:55,696
And then we'll start again

631
01:06:55,697 --> 01:07:00,786
Next time, I'll choose someone more important

632
01:07:20,524 --> 01:07:22,624
I know what you think the First Lady

633
01:07:24,395 --> 01:07:28,024
You want me dead, It may come to that

634
01:07:28,025 --> 01:07:30,534
In a war, people die

635
01:07:30,535 --> 01:07:32,532
This isn't war!

636
01:07:33,171 --> 01:07:36,101
You just murdered an unarmed woman

637
01:07:36,107 --> 01:07:40,278
You, who murdered 100, 000 Iraqis to save a nickel on a gallon of gas

638
01:07:40,279 --> 01:07:43,710
are going to lecture me about the rules of war?

639
01:07:43,916 --> 01:07:45,140
Don't!

640
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,712
Mr.President, how can I help you?

641
01:07:49,856 --> 01:07:52,581
Chief, you can help me dump some fuel

642
01:07:53,594 --> 01:07:55,648
Who's down there in the baggage deck?

643
01:07:55,649 --> 01:07:58,798
- It's a secret service agent, Who? - We have no idea

644
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:01,468
Melanie was shot because one of your men wouldn't show himself

645
01:08:01,469 --> 01:08:02,969
I want to know who he is,

646
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:06,872
Sir, it's someone smart enough to know

647
01:08:07,173 --> 01:08:09,735
if you're hunting with one bullet, you wait for a clean shot

648
01:08:09,736 --> 01:08:11,624
What are you saying?

649
01:08:11,714 --> 01:08:15,483
Whoever that is down there, he may be our only hope

650
01:08:15,484 --> 01:08:19,420
Our only hope is that Washington complies with this bastard

651
01:08:19,421 --> 01:08:22,613
Because any minute now another one of us is dead

652
01:08:23,893 --> 01:08:25,754
And you know what?

653
01:08:26,596 --> 01:08:29,424
I'm afraid it might be me

654
01:08:33,269 --> 01:08:35,902
- Sir, do you see the maintenance panel? - I see it

655
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:39,509
Pop it open, There should be a red switch, Toggle it up

656
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:41,371
Hang on

657
01:08:43,347 --> 01:08:45,849
We got some indicator lights here

658
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:48,610
To dump the fuel, you have to close the circuit for the pump

659
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:51,948
There's no switch, so you'll have to cross the wires

660
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:54,856
- Open the fuel control door, - Hang on

661
01:08:57,262 --> 01:08:59,746
There should be five of them

662
01:08:59,747 --> 01:09:02,401
- Do you see them, sir? - I see them, Yeah

663
01:09:02,402 --> 01:09:05,730
Jesus, There's a lot of goddamn wires, All right, wait a second

664
01:09:06,105 --> 01:09:11,077
We got five, Green, yellow, red, white and blue

665
01:09:11,078 --> 01:09:12,645
Let me double-check

666
01:09:12,646 --> 01:09:14,714
Come on, For Christ's sake, hurry up

667
01:09:14,715 --> 01:09:16,760
Get the wrong wire, you'll cut the engine feeds

668
01:09:16,761 --> 01:09:17,679
The plane will crash

669
01:09:18,185 --> 01:09:20,153
Then we don't want to get the wrong wire, do we?

670
01:09:20,154 --> 01:09:22,728
Cut the green wire

671
01:09:22,891 --> 01:09:24,319
green wire

672
01:09:26,995 --> 01:09:28,529
Cut

673
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:32,795
- Then, cross the. . . - With the. . . With the what?

674
01:09:33,714 --> 01:09:38,330
Hello? Cross it with the what? Say again

675
01:09:38,331 --> 01:09:40,514
Cross the green wire with the. . .

676
01:09:42,044 --> 01:09:43,268
"Run out of battery"

677
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:45,842
For Christ's sake!

678
01:09:45,993 --> 01:09:53,587
Wait, green, yellow

679
01:09:55,726 --> 01:09:57,757
I'm counting on you, red, white and blue

680
01:10:16,315 --> 01:10:19,951
Sirs, it looks like "Air Force One" is losing fuel

681
01:10:24,023 --> 01:10:25,485
We out the oil

682
01:10:25,592 --> 01:10:27,555
out oil

683
01:10:27,727 --> 01:10:30,191
It was hands-feet below

684
01:10:31,866 --> 01:10:34,626
Damn

685
01:10:37,104 --> 01:10:38,601
I'm go down

686
01:10:40,808 --> 01:10:42,100
With Shag band

687
01:10:50,519 --> 01:10:53,051
To see other people on the shoot

688
01:10:53,155 --> 01:10:54,652
ok

689
01:11:28,927 --> 01:11:31,118
Quick give me magazine

690
01:11:36,702 --> 01:11:38,335
Are you ok?

691
01:11:46,746 --> 01:11:48,047
Shag band

692
01:11:48,048 --> 01:11:49,772
What's happened?

693
01:11:51,918 --> 01:11:53,676
he's ded help me

694
01:12:03,231 --> 01:12:04,728
Madam Vice President

695
01:12:04,729 --> 01:12:08,198
the time has come for you to demonstrate your good faith

696
01:12:08,303 --> 01:12:10,733
I've been reading through your press kit

697
01:12:10,839 --> 01:12:16,170
I understand "Air Force One" is able to refuel in midair

698
01:12:17,146 --> 01:12:20,144
We need fuel, And we need it now

699
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:23,784
I'm sure we can come to some sort of arrangement

700
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:27,322
If you'll land the plane, we'll trade fuel for hostages

701
01:12:27,323 --> 01:12:29,989
This is bullshit! It's simple physics

702
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:34,684
Without fuel, the plane crashes, Everybody dies

703
01:12:34,865 --> 01:12:36,900
We're trying to do everything that we can

704
01:12:36,901 --> 01:12:39,665
Tell me what I want to hear

705
01:12:39,666 --> 01:12:42,430
or I will execute a member of the senior staff

706
01:12:42,431 --> 01:12:45,175
and continue killing one hostage every minute

707
01:12:45,176 --> 01:12:49,972
until the plane crash or refueling plane arrive!

708
01:12:53,886 --> 01:12:55,610
What do you say?

709
01:12:58,024 --> 01:12:59,623
Fuel's on its way

710
01:12:59,759 --> 01:13:01,392
Thank you

711
01:13:05,966 --> 01:13:07,758
They will help us fuel

712
01:13:10,837 --> 01:13:12,061
Go

713
01:13:25,486 --> 01:13:27,119
It's all right?

714
01:13:27,389 --> 01:13:28,521
Yeh

715
01:13:35,798 --> 01:13:36,987
Move

716
01:13:53,951 --> 01:13:57,350
- Jim, what are you doing here? - I never left

717
01:13:59,757 --> 01:14:00,946
Djibouti

718
01:14:04,029 --> 01:14:05,628
Watch the door

719
01:14:05,852 --> 01:14:07,498
Where's my family?

720
01:14:07,499 --> 01:14:09,734
Another part of the plane, We haven't seen them

721
01:14:09,735 --> 01:14:12,036
We got weapons now, We should try to retake the plane

722
01:14:12,037 --> 01:14:14,406
Not while they've got Grace and Alice, I can't take that chance

723
01:14:14,407 --> 01:14:17,509
What about trying to disable the plane and force them to land?

724
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:21,043
I tried, I dumped some fuel, Now they're gonna refuel us in midair

725
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:25,143
A refueling tanker? Jesus! Sir?

726
01:14:25,405 --> 01:14:29,989
- There may be a way to get people off, - What do you mean?

727
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:33,292
We have emergency parachutes in the tail cone, but we're too high

728
01:14:33,293 --> 01:14:35,489
If we could get a message to the refueling tanker

729
01:14:35,490 --> 01:14:38,610
get him to drop to 15, 000 feet, we could jump

730
01:14:38,633 --> 01:14:41,233
They've disabled the phones, They control the radios

731
01:14:41,669 --> 01:14:46,967
- Mr.President? Sir? The fax machines, - The phone lines are out

732
01:14:47,208 --> 01:14:51,279
No, Voice lines and faxes are on two different systems of encryption

733
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:54,677
If you disable one, it'd be easy to overlook the other

734
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:01,057
If this works, you get to be postmaster general, Come with me

735
01:15:01,058 --> 01:15:02,158
- Get these people ready, - Yes, Remember

736
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:07,339
15,000 feet and 200 knots, Otherwise it's suicide

737
01:15:07,431 --> 01:15:09,189
You'll need this

738
01:15:10,834 --> 01:15:12,865
Good luck, people

739
01:15:22,914 --> 01:15:24,048
I need a pen

740
01:15:24,049 --> 01:15:26,916
- Where are we sending it? - Situation Room

741
01:15:27,419 --> 01:15:30,554
It makes me so proud that you stuck with us

742
01:15:31,323 --> 01:15:34,112
- Thanks, - Whatever happens

743
01:16:02,869 --> 01:16:04,536
Yes!

744
01:16:23,313 --> 01:16:26,277
Madam Vice President, the attorney general is here

745
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,887
- Thank you for coming, Andrew, - Good that you're here

746
01:16:33,558 --> 01:16:37,888
You want my interpretation of what the Constitution says about the situation?

747
01:16:37,938 --> 01:16:40,033
Yes, Andrew, my understanding is

748
01:16:40,034 --> 01:16:43,700
that if the president is out of contact in a military situation

749
01:16:43,701 --> 01:16:46,404
the secretary of defense is in charge as second in command

750
01:16:46,405 --> 01:16:49,340
- Yes, of course, - Good, Then that settles it

751
01:16:49,341 --> 01:16:51,042
It doesn't settle it at all

752
01:16:51,043 --> 01:16:55,713
The president is not merely out of contact, He is also under duress

753
01:16:55,714 --> 01:16:59,247
His family is held hostage, possibly himself a hostage

754
01:16:59,286 --> 01:17:03,650
It creates an incapacity to discharge the office under the 25th amendment

755
01:17:03,823 --> 01:17:06,292
Surely just as if he'd had a stroke

756
01:17:06,293 --> 01:17:09,462
I think the president would dispute that any incapacity exists

757
01:17:09,463 --> 01:17:14,634
It exists if a majority of the cabinet, including yourself, says it exists

758
01:17:14,635 --> 01:17:18,669
The president may be alive, but he may not be the president

759
01:17:18,973 --> 01:17:23,849
- Madam Vice President? I think you need to see this, - This is CNN breaking news

760
01:17:25,714 --> 01:17:29,543
We interrupt programming to bring you this breaking news bulletin

761
01:17:29,985 --> 01:17:35,455
CNN has received unconfirmed reports, that "Air Force One"has crashed

762
01:17:35,456 --> 01:17:36,191
- Oh, my God! How did they get that? - I don't know

763
01:17:36,192 --> 01:17:41,663
The aircraft was en route from Moscow when it began its Mayday hail

764
01:17:41,664 --> 01:17:43,627
I repeat, We have unconfirmed reports

765
01:17:43,667 --> 01:17:45,938
Call the press room, We have to issue a statement

766
01:17:45,939 --> 01:17:48,871
that the president's plane has crashed in Eastern Europe

767
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:53,975
. . . Then reportedly forced to land Air Force One is not

768
01:18:20,107 --> 01:18:23,831
- Has "Air Force One" crashed? - That is a rumor

769
01:18:24,177 --> 01:18:27,380
- Where'd the story come from? - I don't know where it came from

770
01:18:27,381 --> 01:18:32,852
Listen, I cannot confirm anything, at this point

771
01:18:37,959 --> 01:18:40,423
Ladies and gentlemen, I have a statement

772
01:18:43,899 --> 01:18:48,195
The president's plane,"Air Force One," has been hijacked

773
01:18:50,639 --> 01:18:55,577
Please, Ladies and gentlemen, please let me finish

774
01:18:55,578 --> 01:18:56,912
For security reasons, I cannot divulge

775
01:18:56,913 --> 01:19:01,915
the identity of the hijackers or who was on board the plane

776
01:19:01,916 --> 01:19:05,388
But I'm here to assure the American people

777
01:19:05,389 --> 01:19:08,854
that we are doing everything we can to resolve the situation

778
01:19:10,494 --> 01:19:13,459
For the safety of all the people on the plane

779
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:16,867
I cannot tell you any more than I have, and I'm sure you understand that

780
01:19:16,868 --> 01:19:18,736
Is James Marshall still the president?

781
01:19:18,737 --> 01:19:20,762
I'm coordinating with the National Security Council

782
01:19:20,763 --> 01:19:24,408
pending the president's return

783
01:19:24,409 --> 01:19:26,668
And, yes, James Marshall is still the president

784
01:19:28,614 --> 01:19:30,304
At this time. . .

785
01:19:31,317 --> 01:19:35,647
At this time, I would like to ask all Americans

786
01:19:39,392 --> 01:19:43,323
to pray for the safety of everyone on board "Air Force One,"

787
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:45,491
Thank you

788
01:19:48,335 --> 01:19:50,002
The president

789
01:19:53,068 --> 01:19:55,044
In his speech, Vice-President

790
01:19:57,946 --> 01:20:00,614
Where is the president?

791
01:20:09,091 --> 01:20:10,815
The following okay?

792
01:20:14,230 --> 01:20:15,590
Nothing

793
01:20:21,415 --> 01:20:23,615
Come, air refueling aircraft to the

794
01:20:42,828 --> 01:20:45,223
Folks, listen up, This is your main rip cord

795
01:20:45,397 --> 01:20:49,033
As soon as you clear the plane, give it a yank

796
01:20:49,034 --> 01:20:53,919
If your chute doesn't open, this is your reserve chute, Pull it down, Clear?

797
01:21:07,555 --> 01:21:10,246
"30, 000- foot high"

798
01:21:16,665 --> 01:21:19,900
"Air Force One,"do you read?

799
01:21:19,901 --> 01:21:22,467
Yes, we read, Go ahead

800
01:21:23,071 --> 01:21:25,724
"Air Force One," this is "Extender 1- 0,"

801
01:21:25,725 --> 01:21:29,177
- We have been instructed to refuel you, - Go ahead

802
01:21:29,178 --> 01:21:33,439
Drop to 15, 000 feet and slow to 200 knots

803
01:21:33,749 --> 01:21:36,543
Acknowledged, Two hundred

804
01:21:40,039 --> 01:21:43,242
- They got it! - They got the fax

805
01:21:43,243 --> 01:21:45,294
Sir, your chute

806
01:21:45,295 --> 01:21:48,123
- Please, sir, - I'm not leaving without my family

807
01:21:50,468 --> 01:21:54,681
Okay,"Air Force One," you need to open your receptacle door

808
01:21:54,682 --> 01:21:56,587
Pull the yellow lever on the upper control panel

809
01:21:57,675 --> 01:21:58,637
Done

810
01:21:58,943 --> 01:22:01,475
Go ahead and close distance nice and easy

811
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:06,640
Almost there

812
01:22:08,787 --> 01:22:12,714
- Where are your chutes? - We stay with the president, sir

813
01:22:14,427 --> 01:22:15,559
Thank you

814
01:22:21,614 --> 01:22:25,409
All right, that's close enough, Here we go!

815
01:22:30,878 --> 01:22:32,679
"Open the door jump"

816
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,677
Go! Go! Go! Go!

817
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:36,544
Go! Come on!

818
01:22:37,853 --> 01:22:39,665
Go take a look at

819
01:22:39,666 --> 01:22:42,562
Go! You, come on!

820
01:23:17,937 --> 01:23:19,863
We got,

821
01:23:19,864 --> 01:23:23,397
so far 25 chutes

822
01:23:45,265 --> 01:23:48,595
- I can't hold her, - What are you doing?

823
01:23:48,596 --> 01:23:51,094
Break away! Break away!

824
01:23:57,810 --> 01:24:00,342
Sir, take my hand!

825
01:24:13,256 --> 01:24:15,947
Everybody, break now!

826
01:24:30,641 --> 01:24:31,942
- Don't move! - Let me save him!

827
01:24:31,943 --> 01:24:36,578
He's the president, for God's sake!

828
01:24:46,793 --> 01:24:48,824
Grab my hand!

829
01:24:50,963 --> 01:24:52,152
Major!

830
01:24:56,303 --> 01:24:58,164
I got you

831
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:10,517
We catch the President

832
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:14,181
We've lost the tanker? What else?

833
01:25:14,222 --> 01:25:17,656
- They're counting 32 survivors, - That means they still have hostages

834
01:25:17,657 --> 01:25:19,794
- What about the first family? - No word yet

835
01:25:19,795 --> 01:25:22,097
Losing hostages will make the terrorists more desperate

836
01:25:22,098 --> 01:25:25,529
Madam Vice President, we've got "Air Force One" on the line

837
01:25:25,801 --> 01:25:29,528
This is Vice President Bennett, We're listening

838
01:25:29,706 --> 01:25:35,367
I now hold hostage, the president of the United States of America

839
01:25:36,413 --> 01:25:40,174
Soon we shall enter the sovereign airspace of Kazakhstan

840
01:25:41,285 --> 01:25:45,751
You will cease your military escort at the border

841
01:25:46,524 --> 01:25:52,279
If you violate our airspace, I will execute a member of the first family

842
01:25:53,365 --> 01:25:55,624
Tell our fighters to back off

843
01:25:58,370 --> 01:26:00,470
Get me Ops

844
01:26:02,941 --> 01:26:06,678
You said a presidential incapacity could be declared by a cabinet majority

845
01:26:06,679 --> 01:26:08,244
- Would you sign it? - Under the circumstances

846
01:26:09,616 --> 01:26:11,909
See who else would

847
01:26:21,061 --> 01:26:23,252
Move! Come on, move!

848
01:26:25,191 --> 01:26:29,487
Fast! Move! Quick! Right here

849
01:26:29,604 --> 01:26:30,930
Dad

850
01:26:34,409 --> 01:26:37,942
- It'll be all right, - I know

851
01:27:00,337 --> 01:27:05,520
You've been very busy downstairs, Haven't you?

852
01:27:06,399 --> 01:27:08,802
Killing my men

853
01:27:27,968 --> 01:27:28,834
Stop

854
01:27:28,835 --> 01:27:30,627
You don't wanna do that

855
01:27:32,472 --> 01:27:35,827
I'm what you came for, Don't forget that

856
01:27:35,828 --> 01:27:40,461
Then I kill them, Or just one

857
01:27:40,615 --> 01:27:42,009
You pick

858
01:27:42,717 --> 01:27:46,512
That's what you do in the White House, You play God

859
01:27:53,328 --> 01:27:57,915
Go ahead, Which one lives?

860
01:27:58,867 --> 01:27:59,867
I love you

861
01:27:59,868 --> 01:28:01,000
Go ahead

862
01:28:10,513 --> 01:28:14,149
You're not here for this, You want something

863
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,544
- What is it? - Radek

864
01:28:18,923 --> 01:28:20,886
- How can I do that? I can't, - Then you die, the three of you

865
01:28:22,493 --> 01:28:25,161
I'll do anything to save my family, Don't ask something I can't give!

866
01:28:25,363 --> 01:28:29,333
The most powerful man on the earth, Suddenly, there are things you can't do

867
01:28:29,334 --> 01:28:33,437
This is very curious, Stop with your fucking lies!

868
01:28:33,438 --> 01:28:34,332
sotp

869
01:28:44,116 --> 01:28:46,147
- Petrov will never give up Radek, - Petrov is a dog

870
01:28:46,385 --> 01:28:51,265
He does what you tell him

871
01:28:54,461 --> 01:28:55,992
Tell him to do this

872
01:28:57,197 --> 01:29:02,135
Petrov used me, I just wanted to stop the bloodshed

873
01:29:02,136 --> 01:29:05,639
He wanted a personal victory, Petrov hates Radek

874
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:09,207
Of course he hates Radek, Radek is everything he is not

875
01:29:09,377 --> 01:29:11,890
A great man, a strong man

876
01:29:11,891 --> 01:29:16,919
Are you saying, he would refuse you?

877
01:29:17,086 --> 01:29:21,622
You'd be playing right into his hands, Are you an idiot?

878
01:29:21,623 --> 01:29:26,453
You'd make him into a hero, The man who stopped the terrorists

879
01:29:26,596 --> 01:29:29,492
Or better yet, the man who stopped me

880
01:29:31,034 --> 01:29:34,226
You talk as if you have nothing to do with this

881
01:29:35,973 --> 01:29:38,971
This is all your doing

882
01:29:39,343 --> 01:29:44,553
This infection you call freedom, Without meaning, without purpose

883
01:29:44,554 --> 01:29:50,686
You have given my country, to gangsters and prostitutes

884
01:29:51,790 --> 01:29:57,485
You have taken everything from us

885
01:29:58,998 --> 01:30:01,496
There is nothing left

886
01:30:09,143 --> 01:30:11,174
Call him

887
01:30:17,818 --> 01:30:21,681
No No

888
01:30:27,395 --> 01:30:29,630
Stop, d'not hurt her

889
01:30:29,631 --> 01:30:31,196
Sit!

890
01:30:31,304 --> 01:30:35,029
- No, - I have no choice

891
01:30:36,038 --> 01:30:37,296
- You have the choice, - Leave her alone, It's between us

892
01:30:38,644 --> 01:30:42,142
You lose a child, it hollows you out

893
01:30:42,143 --> 01:30:47,117
We're soldiers, You take my life

894
01:30:48,185 --> 01:30:50,148
Have you no honor?

895
01:30:50,821 --> 01:30:52,010
- I'll count to five, - No!

896
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:54,178
- It's gonna be all right, honey, - One

897
01:30:55,459 --> 01:30:56,591
- It's gonna be all right, - Two

898
01:30:57,562 --> 01:30:58,751
I'll do it

899
01:31:01,833 --> 01:31:04,228
Yes, I'll do it

900
01:31:07,773 --> 01:31:10,567
You just leave my family alone

901
01:31:17,483 --> 01:31:18,775
Leave 'em alone

902
01:31:38,939 --> 01:31:42,108
Executive President of the United States

903
01:31:43,512 --> 01:31:44,736
Mr.President!

904
01:31:47,046 --> 01:31:49,306
We just got an intercept

905
01:31:49,317 --> 01:31:51,849
The president called Petrov and asked him to release Radek

906
01:31:53,121 --> 01:31:55,490
- He can't do that! - He must have no choice

907
01:31:55,491 --> 01:31:57,124
We have a choice

908
01:31:58,127 --> 01:32:02,457
I have the signatures of the cabinet attesting to the president's incapacity

909
01:32:02,665 --> 01:32:05,691
- Sign it and you can overrule him, - No, I won't do that

910
01:32:05,831 --> 01:32:09,639
The United States does not negotiate with terrorists

911
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:13,943
It's been our principle for 25 years, You can't give in to them now

912
01:32:13,944 --> 01:32:16,977
It'll be open season on the United States, Many more will die

913
01:32:19,284 --> 01:32:24,080
Jim isn't making this decision as president, but as a husband and father

914
01:32:27,492 --> 01:32:32,180
History will judge you by what you do right now, For God's sake, sign it

915
01:32:42,375 --> 01:32:43,769
No

916
01:32:49,583 --> 01:32:51,011
No

917
01:33:07,202 --> 01:33:09,870
You have been released

918
01:33:11,206 --> 01:33:15,544
I can now confirm that General Radek is in the process of being released

919
01:33:15,545 --> 01:33:19,146
I repeat, General Radek is now being released

920
01:33:40,493 --> 01:33:44,754
Yes, yes, General Radek has been released

921
01:33:49,547 --> 01:33:51,339
It is confirmed

922
01:33:54,053 --> 01:33:56,380
They are releasing the general

923
01:33:57,723 --> 01:33:58,843
Now what?

924
01:33:58,844 --> 01:34:02,013
Now we return to our homeland

925
01:34:02,062 --> 01:34:05,197
where Radek will decide how best to use you

926
01:34:05,198 --> 01:34:09,767
now that we know you are willing, to negotiate

927
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:12,638
Our nation needs so many things

928
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:16,531
- You said you were gonna release us, - Forgive me, I lied

929
01:34:59,623 --> 01:35:01,256
Listen

930
01:36:15,706 --> 01:36:17,134
Jim

931
01:36:34,727 --> 01:36:36,588
Dad

932
01:36:37,230 --> 01:36:39,790
- Sir, are you hit? - Stay with the major, honey

933
01:36:39,966 --> 01:36:43,229
- Alice, get in the cockpit, - Lie down

934
01:36:43,369 --> 01:36:44,797
Grace

935
01:36:46,907 --> 01:36:48,768
Grace

936
01:36:52,780 --> 01:36:54,447
JIm

937
01:36:55,449 --> 01:36:57,014
Grace

938
01:37:12,602 --> 01:37:15,632
- Let her go! - Not until Radek is safely away

939
01:37:17,106 --> 01:37:20,469
Call it off, Don't give up Radek

940
01:37:20,544 --> 01:37:23,746
If anything happens to the general, your wife will die!

941
01:37:23,747 --> 01:37:25,744
No, Jim

942
01:37:32,257 --> 01:37:33,617
Comrades

943
01:37:33,958 --> 01:37:36,285
To meet our general

944
01:37:36,594 --> 01:37:38,227
He will receive them at any time

945
01:37:38,396 --> 01:37:41,895
You hear that? It's almost over, Mr.President

946
01:38:16,003 --> 01:38:18,034
Drop the gun!

947
01:38:21,944 --> 01:38:23,304
Put Down

948
01:38:29,017 --> 01:38:34,052
You made one mistake when you killed my pilot, Mr.President

949
01:38:34,119 --> 01:38:37,485
No one left to fly the plane

950
01:38:40,563 --> 01:38:43,254
And no parachute

951
01:38:45,336 --> 01:38:47,401
Whatever happens

952
01:38:48,872 --> 01:38:51,666
you lose and I win

953
01:39:45,768 --> 01:39:49,028
Get off my plane!

954
01:40:07,658 --> 01:40:08,825
You all right?

955
01:40:08,926 --> 01:40:11,253
General was about to bring out their

956
01:40:12,663 --> 01:40:16,731
Go, Go! Call Petrov!

957
01:40:57,378 --> 01:41:00,513
Stop, do not move

958
01:41:19,202 --> 01:41:22,677
They killed him, Mr.President

959
01:41:31,082 --> 01:41:35,917
He almost got away, Did you hear me? Radek is dead

960
01:41:35,918 --> 01:41:39,946
Yes! It's the president, We have retaken the plane!

961
01:41:48,401 --> 01:41:49,868
His situation?

962
01:41:49,869 --> 01:41:51,536
Not good

963
01:41:52,517 --> 01:41:55,311
- I don't suppose you know how to fly, - No, sir

964
01:41:55,542 --> 01:41:57,403
- Come along, I'll need a copilot, - Yes, sir

965
01:41:59,946 --> 01:42:01,636
How long did you fly?

966
01:42:01,715 --> 01:42:05,018
25 years, I only had a small plane

967
01:42:05,019 --> 01:42:09,489
Nothing like this

968
01:42:09,490 --> 01:42:11,926
- Anybody there? - We're here, sir

969
01:42:11,927 --> 01:42:13,828
You got somebody that can help me fly this?

970
01:42:13,829 --> 01:42:17,591
Sir, this is ColonelJackson, We need to get you out of hostile territory

971
01:42:17,899 --> 01:42:21,188
- Good idea, Bob, - Look above the central video screen

972
01:42:21,613 --> 01:42:26,167
There's a series of L, E, D, numbers, One of them should read 1-1-0

973
01:42:26,475 --> 01:42:28,539
- Got it, - That's your course heading

974
01:42:28,578 --> 01:42:31,680
Just below, there's a knob surrounded by hash marks

975
01:42:31,681 --> 01:42:35,977
Turn that knob counterclockwise to 290

976
01:42:37,362 --> 01:42:39,347
- We're turning, - Good

977
01:42:43,126 --> 01:42:45,918
- This will take you out of Kazakhstan, - We're gonna be okay

978
01:42:46,330 --> 01:42:50,466
We can't land this plane on autopilot, so we'll need to go over a few things

979
01:42:52,136 --> 01:42:54,327
Where's the nearest safe landing site?

980
01:42:54,639 --> 01:42:56,670
Incirlik, Turkey

981
01:42:57,315 --> 01:42:59,249
- General Northwood, - Madam?

982
01:42:59,250 --> 01:43:02,008
What's that?

983
01:43:02,047 --> 01:43:07,112
- That red dot represents MiGs, - On course to intercept "Air Force One,"

984
01:43:07,386 --> 01:43:12,561
Christ! They took off from Aktubinsk, The base commander there is loyal to Radek

985
01:43:12,759 --> 01:43:16,462
General, send our fighters into Kazakhstan

986
01:43:16,463 --> 01:43:19,999
Order them to use any and all means to protect the president

987
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,192
When you're on final approach, keep the throttles mid-range

988
01:43:23,471 --> 01:43:24,968
- Mr.President, can you hear me? - Yes, Kathryn

989
01:43:25,606 --> 01:43:28,174
We're tracking six MiGs closing on your position, I'm sending in

990
01:43:28,175 --> 01:43:30,780
our F-15s to protect you

991
01:43:30,878 --> 01:43:32,708
- Shit! - Did she say MiGs?

992
01:43:32,984 --> 01:43:35,249
Yes, she said MiGs

993
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:39,716
Get in that seat and put a seat belt on, We're having trouble

994
01:43:41,189 --> 01:43:45,455
These MiGs get closer, I'm gonna have to maneuver this thing

995
01:43:45,456 --> 01:43:47,325
How do I get it off autopilot?

996
01:43:47,463 --> 01:43:50,223
Push the button on the yoke by your left thumb

997
01:43:50,700 --> 01:43:53,201
I'll try a little right turn

998
01:43:53,202 --> 01:43:58,839
Keep your moves smooth and steady, It's all flying, Just step on the ball

999
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:01,305
That's right, Just like riding a bike

1000
01:44:01,645 --> 01:44:04,948
Halo Flight, we are cleared to commit, bearing 0-9-0

1001
01:44:04,949 --> 01:44:07,913
Jettison tanks and push it up

1002
01:44:12,490 --> 01:44:14,749
These MiGs, how far away are they?

1003
01:44:15,493 --> 01:44:16,853
"Radar Lock"

1004
01:44:18,163 --> 01:44:19,852
Never mind

1005
01:44:38,185 --> 01:44:41,013
- One coming, Countermeasures activated, - Left turn

1006
01:44:46,424 --> 01:44:48,128
Jesus Christ!

1007
01:44:48,429 --> 01:44:49,496
- We need some help, - U,S, fighters, this is "Air Force One,"

1008
01:44:49,497 --> 01:44:52,499
We are under attack, Where are you?

1009
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:53,598
This is Halo Flight closing on your position, ETA two minutes

1010
01:44:57,673 --> 01:44:59,465
We may not be here!

1011
01:45:07,517 --> 01:45:08,706
We're hit!

1012
01:45:10,153 --> 01:45:12,184
Christ, We're on fire, We've got an engine on fire

1013
01:45:12,288 --> 01:45:16,685
- Number four engine is on fire, - Pull the fire handle overhead

1014
01:45:16,693 --> 01:45:18,554
I got it

1015
01:45:21,359 --> 01:45:25,201
- We're rolling right, - Left rudder, You have to compensate

1016
01:45:25,202 --> 01:45:26,994
- Do I pull back on number one engine? - Negative, You'll slow down

1017
01:45:29,106 --> 01:45:30,207
How to adjust?

1018
01:45:30,208 --> 01:45:33,241
- Knob, Aft pedestal, - Jesus Christ!

1019
01:45:33,405 --> 01:45:38,012
We got a red light, Looks like we're losing fuel

1020
01:45:39,544 --> 01:45:40,972
Halo Flight

1021
01:45:41,319 --> 01:45:43,350
Everybody lock a bandit

1022
01:45:43,656 --> 01:45:47,758
Stand by for max range, And Fox Three!

1023
01:46:04,236 --> 01:46:06,343
Kill one!

1024
01:46:10,942 --> 01:46:15,654
Kill two! Four more bandits bearing 0-9-0, Halo Flight engage!

1025
01:46:18,483 --> 01:46:20,984
Ha, ha! Good guys are here

1026
01:46:23,455 --> 01:46:27,030
- Bug out west, We'll cover you, - You got it

1027
01:46:29,272 --> 01:46:33,235
- Sir, pull up! You got one on your tail, - Get him off my tail!

1028
01:46:34,311 --> 01:46:35,499
Missile away

1029
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:40,039
- Break left and climb! - Shit! Sir, we've lost countermeasures

1030
01:46:41,586 --> 01:46:44,619
This is "Halo 2," They've lost countermeasures, I'm going in

1031
01:46:53,398 --> 01:46:55,319
Two's down! "Halo 2"is down!

1032
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:57,865
"Air Force One," are you still with us?

1033
01:46:57,903 --> 01:47:00,094
Yes! We're still here

1034
01:47:05,979 --> 01:47:08,272
Not so fast, you son of a bitch!

1035
01:47:16,824 --> 01:47:18,787
The last three MiGs are bugging out, sir

1036
01:47:19,126 --> 01:47:20,793
It's Safe

1037
01:47:23,631 --> 01:47:24,820
- Bob, are you still there? - Yes, sir

1038
01:47:25,499 --> 01:47:26,961
Got a little problem here, My rudder is sluggish

1039
01:47:29,137 --> 01:47:30,804
Let me look

1040
01:47:35,010 --> 01:47:36,643
Oh, man!

1041
01:47:36,945 --> 01:47:39,235
Sir, you're torn up pretty bad

1042
01:47:39,236 --> 01:47:41,658
Do you have any elevator control?

1043
01:47:41,684 --> 01:47:45,012
It's sluggish, too, And we're still losing fuel

1044
01:47:45,755 --> 01:47:46,979
All right

1045
01:47:48,157 --> 01:47:52,157
We got a problem up here, Sirs,"Air Force One" is badly hit

1046
01:47:53,397 --> 01:47:56,327
With the damage, there's no way they can land

1047
01:48:00,318 --> 01:48:02,127
I'm sorry, sir

1048
01:48:03,808 --> 01:48:06,736
- Thanks for your help, - I'll stay on your wing, sir

1049
01:48:07,076 --> 01:48:10,170
Take it straight and steady until we figure out what to do

1050
01:48:11,382 --> 01:48:12,606
Sir

1051
01:48:14,566 --> 01:48:17,284
You did great

1052
01:48:36,855 --> 01:48:40,614
They can't control the plane, Engines are failing and they're losing fuel

1053
01:48:40,615 --> 01:48:42,515
There must be something we can do to help them

1054
01:48:42,516 --> 01:48:46,548
- Is that our airstrip strike team? - Yeah, Why?

1055
01:48:47,288 --> 01:48:49,299
I just had a wild idea

1056
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:52,236
Time is critical, Start turning north

1057
01:48:52,237 --> 01:48:55,527
- You'll get more details en route, - Yes, sir

1058
01:48:55,528 --> 01:48:58,165
Change of orders acknowledged

1059
01:49:02,680 --> 01:49:08,903
Try to hold your heading, sir, They'll rejoin in about 25 minutes

1060
01:49:08,904 --> 01:49:10,141
All right

1061
01:49:10,146 --> 01:49:14,908
- We know it's risky, - Understood, But we are all out of options

1062
01:49:16,728 --> 01:49:18,621
Yeah, baby?

1063
01:49:18,622 --> 01:49:22,758
It'll be okay, Everything's gonna work

1064
01:49:37,476 --> 01:49:40,657
Concerned Americans have gathered at the White House

1065
01:49:40,658 --> 01:49:42,514
to await word on the president and his family

1066
01:49:42,515 --> 01:49:46,451
But CNN has learned that "Air Force One"

1067
01:49:46,452 --> 01:49:48,287
is severely crippled and virtually unlandable

1068
01:49:48,288 --> 01:49:51,590
Sources report that the first family is still trapped on board

1069
01:49:51,591 --> 01:49:55,693
And a daring midair rescue operation is said to be underway

1070
01:49:58,299 --> 01:50:01,461
"Air Force One,"this is "Liberty 2-4" approaching on your left side

1071
01:50:01,462 --> 01:50:03,273
- Do you read? - "Air Force One," Loud and clear

1072
01:50:03,274 --> 01:50:07,232
Gibbs, they're here, Get the door

1073
01:50:07,308 --> 01:50:11,635
- We'll need 10, 000 feet and 200 knots, - We've got to get her slowed down

1074
01:50:13,315 --> 01:50:15,350
"Air Force One"and "Liberty 2-4," this is "AWACS Blue Star,"

1075
01:50:15,351 --> 01:50:19,281
We have you in radar contact

1076
01:50:31,434 --> 01:50:34,371
"Liberty 2-4," they're almost out of fuel

1077
01:50:34,372 --> 01:50:35,705
Roger

1078
01:50:35,706 --> 01:50:38,141
"Air Force One,"keep the wings level

1079
01:50:38,142 --> 01:50:42,039
If the engines fail, sacriice altitude to maintain airspeed

1080
01:50:47,753 --> 01:50:49,386
Ready!

1081
01:50:49,388 --> 01:50:52,356
Free on the 24th, the first person to go on

1082
01:50:52,357 --> 01:50:55,025
Back up, Easy

1083
01:50:55,026 --> 01:50:58,522
"Air Force One,"come left, six

1084
01:51:02,368 --> 01:51:05,865
- How's my speed? - It's good, See if you can hold it

1085
01:51:06,172 --> 01:51:09,967
A little more left, sir, Three, two, stop

1086
01:51:20,221 --> 01:51:23,219
Take my arm! Pull me in!

1087
01:51:24,025 --> 01:51:26,557
Come on! Come on!

1088
01:51:29,764 --> 01:51:31,397
Open I

1089
01:51:32,764 --> 01:51:34,591
Good

1090
01:51:36,872 --> 01:51:40,041
"Liberty," locked in, Where's the president?

1091
01:51:40,042 --> 01:51:42,176
Up in the cockpit

1092
01:51:52,189 --> 01:51:57,461
- We lost another engine, - "Liberty," we lost another engine

1093
01:51:57,462 --> 01:51:59,061
"Liberty 2- 4," Acknowledged

1094
01:52:00,465 --> 01:52:01,959
Sir, time to go

1095
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:06,969
- Who's gonna fly the plane? - I'll take care of that, sir, Got it

1096
01:52:07,139 --> 01:52:08,339
Go!

1097
01:52:08,340 --> 01:52:11,441
Ramp to pilot, Second P, J, 's on the way

1098
01:52:21,254 --> 01:52:24,645
- Mr.President, this way! - My family first

1099
01:52:24,691 --> 01:52:27,585
- Sir, I have orders to take you off, - Them first

1100
01:52:31,089 --> 01:52:33,991
"Blue Star,"the third parajumper is boarding "Air Force One,"

1101
01:52:33,992 --> 01:52:37,762
- Standing by for recovery, - Roger, Moving into receiver position

1102
01:52:41,943 --> 01:52:43,132
- Dad? - You'll be all right, honey

1103
01:52:44,736 --> 01:52:47,102
- Promise? - Promise

1104
01:52:47,103 --> 01:52:49,142
Close your eyes

1105
01:52:49,284 --> 01:52:51,816
You can do it, Just hold on tight

1106
01:52:52,721 --> 01:52:54,980
Nothing would happen, do not worry

1107
01:52:59,651 --> 01:53:01,259
She's okay

1108
01:53:01,797 --> 01:53:03,988
Dad

1109
01:53:06,136 --> 01:53:10,426
- Hang on! - Ramp to pilot, We got her!

1110
01:53:16,147 --> 01:53:18,178
I'm right behind you

1111
01:53:31,716 --> 01:53:33,717
Hang on, Good
