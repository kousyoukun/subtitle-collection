1
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:40,367
English! I'm English!

2
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:42,016
It's grenadiers, mate.

3
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:57,133
Make way!

4
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:02,565
Out of the way!

5
00:06:02,776 --> 00:06:04,243
Go, go, go!

6
00:06:04,678 --> 00:06:06,543
Along the mole. All the way.

7
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,543
The ship's about to leave.

8
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,743
Along the mole. All the way.
The ship's about to leave.

9
00:07:45,846 --> 00:07:47,837
Where's the bloody air force?

10
00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:37,560
The navy's requisitioned her.

11
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:40,666
They'll be back in an hour.
My dad wants to be ready before then.

12
00:08:42,736 --> 00:08:45,364
They've told us to strip her
and load those life jackets.

13
00:08:45,605 --> 00:08:48,403
Some men across the Channel,
at Dunkirk, need taking off.

14
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:49,833
Some men?

15
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,089
Check fuel, Fortis 1 and 2.

16
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:17,393
70 gallons.

17
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:21,604
68 gallons, Fortis Leader.

18
00:09:22,475 --> 00:09:24,965
Stay down at 500 feet to leave fuel

19
00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:27,707
for 40-minute fighting time over Dunkirk.

20
00:09:28,415 --> 00:09:31,316
Understood. Vector 128, angels point five.

21
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:34,652
And keep an eye on that gauge,
even when it gets lively.

22
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:36,755
Save enough to get back.

23
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:49,226
No French soldiers. No French soldiers. No.

24
00:10:49,396 --> 00:10:52,763
No, no French. English only.
English only past this point.

25
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:55,366
No. It's a British ship.
No, you have your own ships.

26
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:57,127
Get back. Get back.

27
00:10:57,303 --> 00:10:59,423
No, you've got your own ships.
This is a British ship.

28
00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:00,903
No, get back.

29
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:03,514
Look, get the stretchers through.
There are stretchers coming.

30
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,134
Get out of the way! Out of the way!

31
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:08,246
Go, go, go. Along the mole. All the way.

32
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,849
The ship's about to leave. About to leave.

33
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:12,137
Along the mole. All the way.

34
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:14,482
Along the mole. Along the mole.
All the way. All the way.

35
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:15,721
No.

36
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:18,619
No, English only. English only!

37
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:22,661
No!

38
00:11:38,044 --> 00:11:39,409
Ready on the stern!

39
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:40,579
Yes, sir!

40
00:11:51,891 --> 00:11:53,358
Man the bowline!

41
00:11:53,526 --> 00:11:54,925
Any more room?

42
00:12:02,469 --> 00:12:04,130
You have to get back!

43
00:12:11,978 --> 00:12:13,468
That's two minutes.

44
00:12:13,646 --> 00:12:15,614
You've missed it. You've missed it.

45
00:12:43,877 --> 00:12:44,877
Is that the last one?

46
00:12:45,411 --> 00:12:46,469
Aye, sir.

47
00:12:49,415 --> 00:12:50,473
Break the line.

48
00:12:54,254 --> 00:12:55,619
Come on! Come on!

49
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:54,536
Dunkirk's so far.
Why can't they just load at Calais?

50
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:57,205
The enemy had something to say about it.

51
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:01,916
Ah, down here we're sitting ducks.

52
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:04,749
Keep 'em peeled. They'll
come out of the sun.

53
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,570
Up the line.

54
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,605
Oi. We'll take it.

55
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:26,377
Drop the gangplank!

56
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:27,546
Yes, sir!

57
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:45,959
Take a run at it.

58
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:17,762
Ready on the stern line, George.

59
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:21,990
Aren't you waiting on the navy?

60
00:15:22,268 --> 00:15:24,228
They've asked for the Moonstone,
they'll have her.

61
00:15:24,404 --> 00:15:25,564
And her captain.

62
00:15:25,772 --> 00:15:27,933
And his son.

63
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:32,167
Thanks for the help, George.

64
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:37,215
What are you doing?

65
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:38,617
You do know where we're going?

66
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,420
France.

67
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:44,354
Into war, George.

68
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:46,619
I'll be useful, sir.

69
00:15:55,201 --> 00:15:56,668
Bandit, 11 o'clock.

70
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,864
Break.

71
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:13,418
He's on me.

72
00:16:15,822 --> 00:16:17,119
I'm on him.

73
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:55,260
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

74
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:56,461
Oi, you two.

75
00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:58,027
Get a shift on.

76
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:02,566
Yeah, pull him tight. Tie a knot in it.

77
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:04,669
Back up the line. Both of you.

78
00:17:04,837 --> 00:17:06,236
Off you go.

79
00:17:06,406 --> 00:17:07,566
Off you go!

80
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,072
That last barrage has damaged the rudder.

81
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,570
Uh, okay...

82
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:14,039
Psst!

83
00:17:49,982 --> 00:17:50,982
Mr. Dawson!

84
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,515
One of ours, George.

85
00:19:02,688 --> 00:19:04,849
On my mark, Fortis 2. Draw him left.

86
00:19:07,026 --> 00:19:08,823
Three, two, one.

87
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:10,386
Mark.

88
00:19:24,677 --> 00:19:25,735
Clear.

89
00:19:29,181 --> 00:19:30,876
Is he down?

90
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:40,754
Yeah, he's down for the count.

91
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:49,428
Fortis Leader, one bandit down.

92
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:55,963
Fortis Leader, do you read?

93
00:20:00,947 --> 00:20:04,508
Fortis 2, I have you to my port.
I have no eyes on Fortis Leader. Over.

94
00:20:04,684 --> 00:20:06,777
Understood, Fortis 1.

95
00:20:06,953 --> 00:20:08,386
Orbit for a look.

96
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,362
How long, Lieutenant?

97
00:20:22,535 --> 00:20:25,595
We need to run a new cable, sir.
They're scrambling.

98
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:27,068
Very well.

99
00:20:31,844 --> 00:20:34,779
Colonel, you're gonna have to decide
how many more wounded to evacuate.

100
00:20:34,947 --> 00:20:37,541
One stretcher takes the space
of seven standing men.

101
00:20:37,717 --> 00:20:38,775
Excuse me.

102
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:54,930
- Rear Admiral.
- Commander.

103
00:20:57,503 --> 00:20:58,868
How's the perimeter?

104
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:00,561
Shrinking every day.

105
00:21:01,007 --> 00:21:03,805
But between our rear guard
and the French, we're holding the line.

106
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,141
And the enemy tanks have stopped.

107
00:21:06,312 --> 00:21:07,677
Why have they stopped?

108
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,560
Waste precious tanks when they can pick us
off from the air, like fish in a barrel?

109
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:14,510
How long does London expect the army
to hold out before we make terms?

110
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:15,687
Make terms?

111
00:21:16,355 --> 00:21:19,688
They're not stopping here.
We need to get our army back.

112
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:22,988
Britain's next
and then the rest of the world.

113
00:21:23,162 --> 00:21:24,254
Christ.

114
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:27,591
I mean, you can practically
see it from here.

115
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:28,859
What?

116
00:21:29,802 --> 00:21:31,030
Home.

117
00:21:32,138 --> 00:21:33,765
What about the French?

118
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:36,271
Publicly, Churchill's told them,
"Bras dessous."

119
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:38,433
Arm in arm, leaving together.

120
00:21:38,644 --> 00:21:39,838
And privately?

121
00:21:40,012 --> 00:21:41,502
We need our army back.

122
00:21:42,081 --> 00:21:44,140
How many men are they talking about, sir?

123
00:21:45,151 --> 00:21:48,643
Churchill wants 30,000.
Ramsay's hoping we can give him 45.

124
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:52,486
There are 400,000 men on this beach, sir.

125
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:55,552
We'll just have to do our best.

126
00:21:56,729 --> 00:21:59,289
Right, well, this mole stays open
at all costs.

127
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:04,458
We're in artillery range from the west.
If anything else sinks here,

128
00:22:04,637 --> 00:22:06,628
the mole's blocked and we're stuffed.

129
00:22:06,806 --> 00:22:08,330
Can't we load from the beaches?

130
00:22:08,507 --> 00:22:10,185
Better than standing out here
when the dive bombs come.

131
00:22:10,209 --> 00:22:11,574
- It's impossible.
- Too shallow?

132
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:14,064
'Cause anything that drafts
over three feet can't get near.

133
00:22:14,088 --> 00:22:17,148
We don't have enough small boats
to ferry men to the destroyers.

134
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:20,317
The mole it is, then, gentlemen.

135
00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:10,793
Hey!

136
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:13,932
Hey! Can you swim it?

137
00:23:15,975 --> 00:23:17,135
Dad, can you get closer?

138
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,377
Can't risk it!

139
00:23:20,946 --> 00:23:21,946
Hang on.

140
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,792
What's your name?

141
00:24:32,051 --> 00:24:33,313
Wreckage below.

142
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,283
Is it more of the 109?

143
00:24:36,422 --> 00:24:37,616
No.

144
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,551
It's Fortis Leader. Over.

145
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,060
You think he got out?

146
00:24:42,294 --> 00:24:43,294
I didn't see a 'chute.

147
00:24:45,064 --> 00:24:47,032
Record his position.

148
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:51,433
Then set heading 128, height 1,000. Over.

149
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:53,696
Vector 128, angels one. Understood.

150
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:01,076
Fortis 2, what's your fuel?

151
00:25:02,448 --> 00:25:03,574
50 gallons. Over.

152
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:06,415
50 gallons.

153
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:11,989
All right, keep letting me know.

154
00:25:12,157 --> 00:25:13,920
My gauge took a bit of a knock back there.

155
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:17,017
Shouldn't you turn back?

156
00:25:17,196 --> 00:25:18,686
No, no.

157
00:25:19,331 --> 00:25:21,697
I'm fairly confident it's just the gauge.

158
00:26:50,923 --> 00:26:52,948
- She's going down!
- Cut her loose!

159
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:54,183
What about the wounded?

160
00:26:55,494 --> 00:26:57,860
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

161
00:27:00,265 --> 00:27:01,698
Cut her loose, and push her off!

162
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:03,630
We can't let her sink at the mole!

163
00:27:04,336 --> 00:27:06,167
Push the bloody boat off!

164
00:27:13,645 --> 00:27:14,645
Help us!

165
00:28:27,953 --> 00:28:29,818
Do you want to come below?

166
00:28:30,022 --> 00:28:31,922
It's much warmer.

167
00:28:32,825 --> 00:28:34,019
It's out of the wind.

168
00:28:34,193 --> 00:28:35,592
Here you go.

169
00:28:38,297 --> 00:28:39,889
Leave him be, George.

170
00:28:40,065 --> 00:28:41,896
He feels safer on deck.

171
00:28:42,801 --> 00:28:44,462
You would too if you'd been bombed.

172
00:28:44,636 --> 00:28:45,636
U-boat.

173
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,137
It was a U-boat.

174
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,376
Get him some more tea, George.

175
00:29:10,395 --> 00:29:14,492
Right, we're about five minutes out,
so climb to 2,000. Over.

176
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:15,792
That's more fuel.

177
00:29:15,885 --> 00:29:17,645
I know, but I don't want
to get jumped again.

178
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:18,789
Let's get a decent altitude.

179
00:29:18,837 --> 00:29:20,797
We can dive down on the bastards
from above. Over.

180
00:29:20,939 --> 00:29:22,429
Understood. Angels two.

181
00:29:22,608 --> 00:29:23,608
Over.

182
00:29:26,111 --> 00:29:27,111
Right, Highlanders.

183
00:29:27,646 --> 00:29:29,238
Let's find you another ship.

184
00:30:41,353 --> 00:30:42,353
Come on.

185
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:47,917
Everyone else, keep climbing.
Climb on the deck.

186
00:30:48,493 --> 00:30:51,223
Climb on the deck.

187
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,755
Watch your heads on the rail. Watch it.

188
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,331
That's right, keep going down.
Take a blanket.

189
00:30:57,502 --> 00:30:58,862
Down you go. Put this on, my love.

190
00:30:59,404 --> 00:31:02,271
Down you go. Keep going down.

191
00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:04,568
There's a nice cup of
tea for you down there.

192
00:31:04,743 --> 00:31:05,743
Keep moving down.

193
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:07,572
Take a blanket.

194
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,780
Try and make some room.

195
00:31:09,948 --> 00:31:11,381
Keep moving down, boys.

196
00:31:12,718 --> 00:31:13,776
This way.

197
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,512
A cup of tea down there.

198
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:44,181
There you go. Down there. Move down there.

199
00:32:03,435 --> 00:32:04,902
What's wrong with your friend?

200
00:32:24,222 --> 00:32:25,542
He's looking for a quick way out.

201
00:32:27,926 --> 00:32:29,325
In case we go down.

202
00:33:07,866 --> 00:33:09,299
Where are we going?

203
00:33:09,434 --> 00:33:10,958
Dunkirk.

204
00:33:13,004 --> 00:33:15,063
No, uh, no, no, we're going to England.

205
00:33:16,808 --> 00:33:18,799
We have to go to Dunkirk first.

206
00:33:19,344 --> 00:33:22,142
Look, I'm not going back.

207
00:33:23,548 --> 00:33:25,072
I'm not going back.

208
00:33:26,051 --> 00:33:27,348
Look at it.

209
00:33:28,587 --> 00:33:30,214
If we go there, we'll die.

210
00:33:37,396 --> 00:33:38,396
I see your point, son.

211
00:33:39,264 --> 00:33:41,357
Well, let's plot a course.

212
00:33:44,703 --> 00:33:47,365
You can take your tea below and warm up.

213
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:52,535
Peter, have we got space
for a man to lie down?

214
00:33:52,677 --> 00:33:54,076
Uh, yeah.

215
00:33:59,484 --> 00:34:00,883
Here, come on.

216
00:34:06,258 --> 00:34:07,258
Careful.

217
00:34:09,694 --> 00:34:10,854
Careful.

218
00:34:17,202 --> 00:34:18,464
Just in there.

219
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:20,704
I'll get you some more tea.

220
00:34:37,456 --> 00:34:38,980
Is he a coward, Mr. Dawson?

221
00:34:39,157 --> 00:34:40,784
He's shell-shocked, George.

222
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:42,517
He's not himself.

223
00:34:45,297 --> 00:34:47,663
He may never be himself again.

224
00:34:56,241 --> 00:34:57,435
Here you are.

225
00:35:14,993 --> 00:35:16,927
40 gallons, Fortis 1.

226
00:35:18,463 --> 00:35:19,555
40 gallons, understood.

227
00:35:23,735 --> 00:35:25,202
Heinkel, 11 o'clock.

228
00:35:25,637 --> 00:35:28,538
She's lining up to drop her load
on that minesweeper.

229
00:35:28,707 --> 00:35:29,707
Fighters?

230
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:32,343
Yeah, 109s off her starboard.

231
00:35:33,445 --> 00:35:34,878
I'm on the bomber.

232
00:36:26,698 --> 00:36:27,698
Got him! Got him!

233
00:37:00,065 --> 00:37:01,828
Oh, she's turning. You must've damaged her.

234
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:03,427
Where's the escort?

235
00:37:03,602 --> 00:37:04,762
Well, I got one of...

236
00:37:05,437 --> 00:37:06,437
Jesus!

237
00:37:25,256 --> 00:37:26,484
I'm going down.

238
00:37:26,658 --> 00:37:28,216
I'm on him. Bail out.

239
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:49,973
No, the swell looks good. I'm ditching.

240
00:38:10,802 --> 00:38:14,529
- Don't leave us!
- Come back!

241
00:38:15,073 --> 00:38:17,598
- Wait for us!
- Help! Help us!

242
00:38:20,445 --> 00:38:23,846
Pick us up! Pick us up!

243
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:29,019
Come back!

244
00:38:30,789 --> 00:38:31,983
Torpedo!

245
00:39:03,254 --> 00:39:07,213
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

246
00:40:53,765 --> 00:40:54,959
Help!

247
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:56,794
Get us out of here!

248
00:41:11,516 --> 00:41:12,813
Spitfires, George.

249
00:41:12,984 --> 00:41:15,316
Greatest plane ever built.

250
00:41:19,157 --> 00:41:20,157
You didn't even look.

251
00:41:21,526 --> 00:41:23,494
Rolls-Royce Merlin engines.

252
00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:27,526
Sweetest sound you could hear out here.

253
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:29,333
Hello?

254
00:41:31,002 --> 00:41:32,993
Could you open the door?

255
00:41:33,171 --> 00:41:34,695
Hello? Can you hear me?

256
00:41:36,241 --> 00:41:38,539
Open the door!

257
00:41:38,977 --> 00:41:40,342
Do you hear me?

258
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,977
He wants to come out.

259
00:41:44,148 --> 00:41:46,139
What have you done? Locked him in?

260
00:41:46,317 --> 00:41:47,807
Let him out, for God's sake.

261
00:41:47,986 --> 00:41:48,986
Hello?

262
00:41:50,922 --> 00:41:52,583
Let me out!

263
00:42:07,105 --> 00:42:09,573
You haven't turned around.

264
00:42:12,176 --> 00:42:13,939
No. We have a job to do.

265
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,574
Job? This is a pleasure yacht.

266
00:42:18,683 --> 00:42:21,447
You're weekend sailors,
not the bloody navy.

267
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,747
A man your age?

268
00:42:24,222 --> 00:42:26,690
Men my age dictate this war.

269
00:42:26,858 --> 00:42:29,554
Why should we be allowed
to send our children to fight it?

270
00:42:29,727 --> 00:42:31,482
You should be at home!

271
00:42:31,562 --> 00:42:35,225
Well, there won't be any home if we
allow a slaughter across the Channel.

272
00:42:42,273 --> 00:42:43,993
He's turning tail. I'm gonna get after him.

273
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:46,910
Good luck.

274
00:42:47,078 --> 00:42:50,070
Watch your fuel. You're at 15 gallons.

275
00:42:52,717 --> 00:42:54,150
15 gallons, understood.

276
00:42:56,254 --> 00:42:57,812
Best of luck, Collins.

277
00:43:00,892 --> 00:43:03,053
Collins, do you read?

278
00:44:04,856 --> 00:44:07,017
Oi! No! No!

279
00:44:07,191 --> 00:44:08,886
Get off! Get off!

280
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,291
Piss off, the both of you.
It's too crowded.

281
00:44:11,462 --> 00:44:12,690
You can't leave us!

282
00:44:13,765 --> 00:44:14,823
Make some room!

283
00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:15,999
No!

284
00:44:16,901 --> 00:44:18,198
No! Get off!

285
00:44:18,369 --> 00:44:20,129
You men, leave off.
You'll capsize the boat.

286
00:44:20,153 --> 00:44:22,065
She's gone over twice on the way out here.

287
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,160
You have to stay calm.
There are plenty of boats.

288
00:44:24,184 --> 00:44:25,184
Calm?

289
00:44:25,209 --> 00:44:27,473
Wait till you get torpedoed,
then tell us to be calm!

290
00:44:28,012 --> 00:44:29,309
You have life jackets?

291
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,777
Yes, they do.

292
00:44:30,982 --> 00:44:34,176
Don't panic, boys. The water's
not too rough or too cold.

293
00:44:34,352 --> 00:44:35,876
We're heading back to the beach.

294
00:44:36,054 --> 00:44:38,318
- Let's go to Dover!
- Yeah!

295
00:44:39,057 --> 00:44:41,017
We can't make it across the Channel
in this, lads.

296
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:44,350
We need to get back to the beach
and wait for another ride.

297
00:44:44,695 --> 00:44:47,493
You men in the water, float here,
save your strength.

298
00:44:47,665 --> 00:44:49,189
We'll come back for you.

299
00:44:49,367 --> 00:44:50,367
Oars in!

300
00:44:51,502 --> 00:44:54,198
Together, pull!

301
00:44:55,473 --> 00:44:57,737
Together, pull!

302
00:45:00,078 --> 00:45:01,078
Pull!

303
00:45:02,113 --> 00:45:04,274
Together, pull!

304
00:45:06,517 --> 00:45:07,541
Pull!

305
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,588
Together, pull!

306
00:45:14,826 --> 00:45:17,021
There's no hiding from this, son.

307
00:45:19,297 --> 00:45:21,959
What is it you think you can do
out there, on this thing?

308
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,294
There's not just us. A call went out.

309
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:27,529
We aren't the only ones
to answer, you know.

310
00:45:27,705 --> 00:45:29,366
You don't even have guns.

311
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:30,740
Do you have a gun?

312
00:45:30,908 --> 00:45:33,638
Yes, of course. A rifle, a 303.

313
00:45:33,811 --> 00:45:36,837
Did it help you against the dive bombers
and the U-boats?

314
00:45:38,082 --> 00:45:39,743
You're an old fool.

315
00:45:40,952 --> 00:45:42,783
I'm not going back.

316
00:45:43,387 --> 00:45:44,615
I'm not going back.

317
00:45:45,323 --> 00:45:46,323
Turn it around.

318
00:45:47,425 --> 00:45:48,824
I'm not turning round.

319
00:45:49,494 --> 00:45:50,654
Turn it around!

320
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:53,624
Turn it...

321
00:45:55,633 --> 00:45:57,153
- Calm it down, mate.
- Turn it around!

322
00:45:57,268 --> 00:45:58,268
Wait, wait!

323
00:45:58,436 --> 00:45:59,835
Calm it down, mate.

324
00:46:01,305 --> 00:46:02,305
George?

325
00:46:03,141 --> 00:46:04,141
George!

326
00:46:06,944 --> 00:46:07,944
What have you done?

327
00:46:09,647 --> 00:46:11,114
Okay, you're all right, George.

328
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:13,009
You're all right.

329
00:46:13,751 --> 00:46:16,743
Hang on. Okay. Okay, just...

330
00:46:16,888 --> 00:46:18,412
That's it. That's good enough.

331
00:46:18,589 --> 00:46:21,490
It's gonna keep some pressure on.
There we go.

332
00:46:21,659 --> 00:46:23,251
There we go.

333
00:46:23,427 --> 00:46:24,655
Can you hear me, George?

334
00:48:59,216 --> 00:49:00,706
Come on, lads!

335
00:49:01,986 --> 00:49:04,819
Come on! Come on, boys!

336
00:51:10,314 --> 00:51:11,474
It's a pier.

337
00:51:12,583 --> 00:51:14,141
For when the water comes in.

338
00:51:18,722 --> 00:51:20,087
The tide's turning now.

339
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:23,159
How can you tell?

340
00:51:25,629 --> 00:51:27,096
The bodies come back.

341
00:51:57,928 --> 00:51:58,928
Hey.

342
00:52:11,275 --> 00:52:12,936
Hey, Highlanders!

343
00:52:22,853 --> 00:52:24,514
Hey, Highlanders!

344
00:52:24,688 --> 00:52:25,882
What's that way?

345
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:27,390
A boat.

346
00:52:27,491 --> 00:52:28,491
She's grounded.

347
00:52:29,293 --> 00:52:31,352
Not when the tide comes in, she's not.

348
00:52:48,646 --> 00:52:51,240
Be a brave lad.

349
00:52:53,784 --> 00:52:55,251
You and Mr. Dawson?

350
00:52:57,354 --> 00:52:58,754
It's the best thing I've ever done.

351
00:52:59,523 --> 00:53:01,923
You're all right. You're okay.

352
00:53:13,003 --> 00:53:15,494
Sea Cadet.
It's the only thing I've ever done.

353
00:53:15,673 --> 00:53:17,800
It's all right. It's okay.
Just have some water.

354
00:53:20,678 --> 00:53:22,339
I told my dad...

355
00:53:22,513 --> 00:53:24,674
I've done nothing at school

356
00:53:26,584 --> 00:53:28,745
and that I would do something one day.

357
00:53:31,555 --> 00:53:34,023
Maybe get in the local paper.

358
00:53:34,258 --> 00:53:36,453
Maybe my teachers would see it.

359
00:53:36,627 --> 00:53:38,185
Okay, get some rest.

360
00:53:38,829 --> 00:53:41,354
I need you back up on deck
as soon as you're able.

361
00:53:42,633 --> 00:53:43,633
I can't.

362
00:53:44,368 --> 00:53:45,892
What?

363
00:53:49,807 --> 00:53:51,138
I can't see.

364
00:54:51,068 --> 00:54:52,068
Sir.

365
00:54:53,437 --> 00:54:55,871
The French have been forced back
on the western side.

366
00:54:56,807 --> 00:54:58,167
They're still holding a perimeter?

367
00:54:58,308 --> 00:54:59,308
For now.

368
00:55:00,878 --> 00:55:03,118
Officer coming through.
Move yourselves. Move yourselves!

369
00:55:13,957 --> 00:55:15,288
Where are the destroyers?

370
00:55:15,459 --> 00:55:16,983
There'll be one soon.

371
00:55:20,097 --> 00:55:21,097
One?

372
00:55:21,231 --> 00:55:23,825
After yesterday's losses,
it's one ship on the mole at a time.

373
00:55:24,001 --> 00:55:25,059
The battle is here.

374
00:55:25,235 --> 00:55:26,795
What the hell are they saving them for?

375
00:55:26,904 --> 00:55:28,371
The next battle.

376
00:55:28,539 --> 00:55:30,006
The one for Britain.

377
00:55:30,174 --> 00:55:32,108
It's the same with the planes.

378
00:55:34,244 --> 00:55:35,871
But it's right there.

379
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:37,580
You can practically...

380
00:55:37,748 --> 00:55:39,807
Seeing home doesn't help us
get there, Colonel.

381
00:55:39,983 --> 00:55:41,917
They need to send more ships.

382
00:55:42,853 --> 00:55:44,411
Every hour the enemy pushes closer.

383
00:55:45,255 --> 00:55:47,246
They've activated the small vessels pool.

384
00:55:48,225 --> 00:55:49,225
Small vessels?

385
00:55:49,393 --> 00:55:51,861
It's the list of civilian boats
for requisition.

386
00:55:52,362 --> 00:55:53,362
Civilian?

387
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:56,928
We need destroyers.

388
00:55:57,101 --> 00:55:58,864
Small boats can load from the beach.

389
00:55:59,036 --> 00:56:00,264
Not in these conditions.

390
00:56:00,437 --> 00:56:02,928
Well, I'd rather face waves
than dive bombers.

391
00:56:05,909 --> 00:56:08,673
No, you're right. They
won't get up in this.

392
00:56:10,013 --> 00:56:12,777
The Royal Engineers are building piers
from lorries.

393
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:15,578
At least that should help us
when the tide comes back.

394
00:56:15,753 --> 00:56:17,914
Well, we'll know in six hours' time.

395
00:56:18,922 --> 00:56:20,402
I thought the tides were every three?

396
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:24,957
Then it's good that you're army
and I'm navy, isn't it?

397
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:28,728
There. Vanquisher.

398
00:56:43,547 --> 00:56:44,741
Where's the crew?

399
00:56:44,915 --> 00:56:46,780
Probably got spooked
after they ran aground.

400
00:56:47,584 --> 00:56:49,108
Scarpered up the beach.

401
00:56:49,586 --> 00:56:50,586
Why?

402
00:56:50,754 --> 00:56:53,951
'Cause we're outside the perimeter.
Enemy could be right there.

403
00:56:55,125 --> 00:56:57,559
All right, best shut
ourselves inside, boys.

404
00:56:57,728 --> 00:56:58,728
Wait for the high tide.

405
00:56:58,896 --> 00:57:00,454
How long's that?

406
00:57:00,631 --> 00:57:02,258
Every three hours.

407
00:57:25,823 --> 00:57:27,916
I've put a bit of pressure on it.

408
00:57:28,091 --> 00:57:30,025
Strapped him up, made him comfortable.

409
00:57:31,295 --> 00:57:32,319
What?

410
00:57:34,631 --> 00:57:35,631
It's bad, Dad.

411
00:57:38,635 --> 00:57:40,125
Well, should we turn back?

412
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:47,510
We've come so far.

413
00:57:48,879 --> 00:57:50,369
Dad, is that one of ours?

414
00:57:51,949 --> 00:57:55,214
That's a Heinkel.
They'll go for that minesweeper there.

415
00:57:55,719 --> 00:57:57,759
Hang on. Shouldn't we stand by
to pick up survivors?

416
00:57:57,783 --> 00:57:59,648
To do that we have to survive ourselves.

417
00:58:04,328 --> 00:58:06,489
Poke your head out.
See if the water's come in.

418
00:58:11,967 --> 00:58:13,434
Talkative sod, aren't you?

419
00:58:39,562 --> 00:58:41,359
It's barely come in at all.

420
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:43,691
- Fuck's sake.
- Calm down.

421
00:58:43,866 --> 00:58:46,027
What goes out comes back in again, right?

422
00:58:46,202 --> 00:58:47,601
Yeah, but how long?

423
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:05,220
Spitfires!

424
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:07,112
Come on.

425
00:59:13,763 --> 00:59:14,787
Come on, come on.

426
00:59:23,572 --> 00:59:24,903
Dad, he got him!

427
00:59:25,074 --> 00:59:26,632
Yeah! Yeah!

428
00:59:33,983 --> 00:59:35,507
The Heinkel's moving off.

429
00:59:40,656 --> 00:59:41,656
Yeah.

430
00:59:43,292 --> 00:59:44,292
Oh, no.

431
00:59:46,262 --> 00:59:48,059
Smoke from the Spitfire!

432
00:59:49,398 --> 00:59:51,229
Watch for a parachute!

433
00:59:58,073 --> 00:59:59,073
Oi.

434
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:05,740
Oi. Oi.

435
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,125
Are you German?

436
01:00:53,295 --> 01:00:54,626
No, Dutch. Dutch!

437
01:00:55,998 --> 01:00:56,998
Merchant navy.

438
01:00:57,833 --> 01:00:59,323
Here to pick you up. To help you.

439
01:00:59,501 --> 01:01:01,162
Why'd you leave your boat?

440
01:01:01,337 --> 01:01:02,565
In case the Germans come.

441
01:01:03,205 --> 01:01:05,298
We wait up the beach.

442
01:01:05,474 --> 01:01:07,066
With the soldiers. Wait for the tide.

443
01:01:07,243 --> 01:01:09,541
You came back. The tide must be in.

444
01:01:10,713 --> 01:01:12,408
Coming. Coming, yes.

445
01:01:12,882 --> 01:01:14,747
But more hours till we float.

446
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:16,050
Hours?

447
01:01:16,218 --> 01:01:17,685
Why'd you come back?

448
01:01:19,588 --> 01:01:20,748
Not so heavy when I left.

449
01:01:34,036 --> 01:01:35,594
No 'chute!

450
01:01:40,676 --> 01:01:41,676
Best of luck, Collins.

451
01:01:47,216 --> 01:01:49,081
Collins, do you read?

452
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:16,234
He's down.

453
01:02:59,355 --> 01:03:00,355
Dad.

454
01:03:00,522 --> 01:03:01,750
Dad, watch the engine.

455
01:03:02,624 --> 01:03:05,058
Dad, he's down. There was no 'chute.

456
01:03:09,365 --> 01:03:10,725
Dad, come on. There was no 'chute.

457
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:12,700
He's probably dead.

458
01:03:12,868 --> 01:03:15,029
Damn it, I hear you, Peter! I hear you!

459
01:03:18,374 --> 01:03:20,069
He may be alive. Maybe.

460
01:03:22,144 --> 01:03:23,975
We may be able to help him.

461
01:04:17,566 --> 01:04:19,830
No! Then they'll know we're in here.

462
01:04:20,002 --> 01:04:21,492
Why else are they shooting at us?

463
01:04:22,004 --> 01:04:23,528
Look at the grouping.

464
01:04:27,376 --> 01:04:28,843
Target practice.

465
01:05:30,072 --> 01:05:33,473
Go. Plug it. Go, go.

466
01:05:53,695 --> 01:05:54,992
We have to plug it.

467
01:05:55,164 --> 01:05:56,825
After you, mate.

468
01:06:18,887 --> 01:06:20,377
You ready? Go!

469
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:27,551
How do we get off?
Do we need to ditch some ballast?

470
01:06:27,996 --> 01:06:29,793
Weight! Do we need to lose weight?

471
01:06:29,965 --> 01:06:31,694
Weight. Weight, yes.

472
01:06:31,867 --> 01:06:33,198
Yes.

473
01:06:33,368 --> 01:06:34,733
Somebody needs to get off.

474
01:06:35,804 --> 01:06:37,203
Well volunteered.

475
01:06:37,372 --> 01:06:38,896
We don't need a volunteer.

476
01:06:39,374 --> 01:06:41,001
I know someone who ought to get off.

477
01:06:43,445 --> 01:06:44,445
This one.

478
01:06:45,814 --> 01:06:47,076
He's a German spy.

479
01:06:47,249 --> 01:06:48,648
Don't be daft.

480
01:06:48,817 --> 01:06:50,341
He's a fucking Jerry.

481
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,313
Have you noticed he hasn't said a word?

482
01:06:55,023 --> 01:06:56,183
'Cause I have.

483
01:06:57,059 --> 01:06:58,059
He don't speak English.

484
01:06:58,227 --> 01:07:01,390
If he does it's with an accent
that's thicker than sauerkraut sauce.

485
01:07:01,563 --> 01:07:03,258
You're daft. Tell him.

486
01:07:03,832 --> 01:07:05,026
Yeah.

487
01:07:08,403 --> 01:07:10,837
Tell me.

488
01:07:35,931 --> 01:07:37,193
Tell me, Gibson.

489
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:46,240
Tell me!

490
01:07:47,309 --> 01:07:48,799
Tell him, for God's sake!

491
01:07:57,653 --> 01:07:59,280
A frog.

492
01:07:59,755 --> 01:08:01,279
A bloody frog.

493
01:08:02,057 --> 01:08:05,117
A cowardly little queue-jumping frog.

494
01:08:05,794 --> 01:08:07,159
Who's Gibson, eh?

495
01:08:07,329 --> 01:08:09,797
Some naked, dead Englishman
lying out on that sand?

496
01:08:09,965 --> 01:08:11,990
Did you at least have the decency
to bury him?

497
01:08:12,234 --> 01:08:14,114
He did. I helped him.
I thought it was his mate.

498
01:08:14,169 --> 01:08:15,889
- Maybe he killed him.
- He didn't kill him.

499
01:08:15,913 --> 01:08:16,593
How do we know?

500
01:08:16,772 --> 01:08:19,172
How hard is it to find a dead Englishman
on Dunkirk beach?

501
01:08:19,341 --> 01:08:20,603
He didn't kill anyone.

502
01:08:20,776 --> 01:08:23,296
He was just looking for a way
off the sand, like the rest of us.

503
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:30,079
Haven't they had enough practice by now?

504
01:08:30,252 --> 01:08:32,243
They're trying to make
sure she won't float.

505
01:08:32,421 --> 01:08:33,911
Will she still float?

506
01:08:34,089 --> 01:08:35,852
Float, yes. Yes, with less weight.

507
01:08:37,526 --> 01:08:38,726
And we know who's getting off.

508
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:40,854
No, you can't do that.
He's French. He's on our side.

509
01:08:41,029 --> 01:08:42,519
Go on. Up you go.

510
01:08:42,698 --> 01:08:44,962
As soon as he pokes his head out,
they'll slaughter him.

511
01:08:45,133 --> 01:08:46,361
Better him than me.

512
01:08:46,535 --> 01:08:47,695
It's not fair.

513
01:08:47,869 --> 01:08:49,166
Survival's not fair.

514
01:08:49,338 --> 01:08:50,338
No, it's shit.

515
01:08:51,206 --> 01:08:53,538
It's fear, and it's greed.

516
01:08:53,709 --> 01:08:55,700
Fate pushed through the bowels of men.

517
01:08:55,877 --> 01:08:56,877
Shit.

518
01:08:58,380 --> 01:08:59,642
He saved our lives.

519
01:08:59,815 --> 01:09:01,043
And he's about to do it again.

520
01:09:01,216 --> 01:09:02,274
No, don't! Stop!

521
01:09:03,618 --> 01:09:06,985
Somebody's gotta get off,
so the rest of us can live.

522
01:09:07,723 --> 01:09:08,747
If you wanna volunteer...

523
01:09:08,957 --> 01:09:10,117
Fuck no.

524
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:11,359
I'm going home.

525
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:13,687
And if this is the price?

526
01:09:18,667 --> 01:09:19,827
I'll live with it.

527
01:09:20,469 --> 01:09:21,469
But it's wrong.

528
01:09:22,237 --> 01:09:23,237
Go on!

529
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:27,331
One man's not going to make
enough difference.

530
01:09:27,509 --> 01:09:29,869
You'd best hope it does,
because you'd be volunteering next.

531
01:09:30,746 --> 01:09:31,746
What?

532
01:09:32,581 --> 01:09:34,515
We're regimental brothers, mate.

533
01:09:35,150 --> 01:09:36,515
It's just the way it is.

534
01:09:46,528 --> 01:09:47,893
We float!

535
01:09:48,597 --> 01:09:49,723
We float!

536
01:09:50,432 --> 01:09:52,024
Start the bloody engine!

537
01:10:30,405 --> 01:10:31,804
Afternoon.

538
01:11:27,162 --> 01:11:29,528
I'm sorry, son. I really don't know.

539
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,963
You're right not moving him.

540
01:11:37,539 --> 01:11:39,029
You've done the best for him you can.

541
01:11:51,152 --> 01:11:52,312
We've wasted the day.

542
01:11:52,487 --> 01:11:54,512
I share your frustration, Colonel.

543
01:11:56,057 --> 01:11:57,057
Johnny!

544
01:12:04,032 --> 01:12:05,966
Grounded trawler, taking fire.

545
01:12:06,101 --> 01:12:08,160
They're breaking through the dunes
to the east.

546
01:12:11,973 --> 01:12:13,372
This is it.

547
01:12:21,483 --> 01:12:22,541
Plug the holes!

548
01:12:22,717 --> 01:12:24,014
With what?

549
01:12:34,930 --> 01:12:36,830
Plug the holes!

550
01:12:38,567 --> 01:12:41,365
Other side! Other side!

551
01:13:31,152 --> 01:13:32,619
What do you see?

552
01:13:39,494 --> 01:13:40,825
Home.

553
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:37,401
Is he all right? The boy?

554
01:15:39,414 --> 01:15:40,676
No.

555
01:15:40,849 --> 01:15:42,476
No, he's not.

556
01:15:53,928 --> 01:15:54,928
Dad!

557
01:16:02,804 --> 01:16:05,102
Come on. Come on, Farrier. Come on.

558
01:16:24,092 --> 01:16:25,650
There's men in the water!

559
01:17:11,005 --> 01:17:12,005
Oil.

560
01:17:13,474 --> 01:17:15,965
It's oil. Oil. You're getting into oil!

561
01:17:51,412 --> 01:17:52,879
Keep coming.

562
01:17:53,781 --> 01:17:55,214
Plenty of room.

563
01:18:00,255 --> 01:18:02,052
All right, below deck.

564
01:18:38,126 --> 01:18:40,026
Abandon ship!

565
01:19:02,283 --> 01:19:04,581
Gibson! Leave it!

566
01:19:47,595 --> 01:19:48,755
Below decks.

567
01:20:37,678 --> 01:20:39,878
Listen, we have to get as many
of you on board as we can

568
01:20:40,014 --> 01:20:41,174
before that oil catches fire.

569
01:20:41,315 --> 01:20:43,909
You go below decks or you get
off my boat. That's your choice.

570
01:20:46,854 --> 01:20:48,583
Keep coming.

571
01:20:49,924 --> 01:20:52,415
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Careful! Careful down there!

572
01:20:52,593 --> 01:20:53,890
Careful! Careful down there!

573
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:58,057
He's dead, mate.

574
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:04,763
So be bloody careful with him.

575
01:21:26,794 --> 01:21:28,455
Um, will he be okay?

576
01:21:29,230 --> 01:21:30,288
The boy?

577
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:37,270
Yeah.

578
01:23:01,022 --> 01:23:02,785
He's coming back round.

579
01:23:03,658 --> 01:23:04,955
He's coming back round!

580
01:23:10,831 --> 01:23:12,731
Come on, Farrier. Come on.

581
01:23:27,982 --> 01:23:29,210
Get off the ship!

582
01:23:45,399 --> 01:23:46,866
Come on, Farrier. Get around them.

583
01:23:47,034 --> 01:23:48,331
Come on, come on.

584
01:24:44,992 --> 01:24:45,992
Go.

585
01:24:50,498 --> 01:24:51,498
Go! Go! Go!

586
01:25:05,913 --> 01:25:06,971
Go!

587
01:25:40,748 --> 01:25:41,748
Easy.

588
01:25:46,887 --> 01:25:48,149
Take me home.

589
01:26:46,046 --> 01:26:47,343
Where are you from?

590
01:26:48,249 --> 01:26:50,046
Out of Dartmouth!

591
01:26:50,217 --> 01:26:51,445
Christ.

592
01:26:52,553 --> 01:26:53,884
You from Deal?

593
01:26:54,054 --> 01:26:55,521
I am!

594
01:26:55,689 --> 01:26:57,816
You watch the current at the mouth!

595
01:26:58,025 --> 01:26:59,025
Aye.

596
01:26:59,193 --> 01:27:00,251
And thank you!

597
01:27:50,077 --> 01:27:51,101
That's a fighter.

598
01:27:51,278 --> 01:27:52,438
Yes, an Me 109.

599
01:27:52,613 --> 01:27:54,333
From the south. Peter, you take the tiller.

600
01:27:54,782 --> 01:27:56,613
Listen for my instructions.

601
01:27:57,451 --> 01:27:58,645
Point her south!

602
01:28:11,298 --> 01:28:12,298
Full speed, Peter.

603
01:28:14,702 --> 01:28:16,169
Keep coming round.

604
01:28:16,337 --> 01:28:17,531
Keep coming.

605
01:28:18,873 --> 01:28:22,536
Before he fires, he's gotta
drop his nose. I'll give you the signal.

606
01:28:24,044 --> 01:28:25,272
- Now?
- No, no. Wait.

607
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,505
Wait for him to commit to his line.

608
01:28:45,733 --> 01:28:46,791
Now!

609
01:29:25,005 --> 01:29:26,005
He's gone.

610
01:29:26,106 --> 01:29:27,437
Yeah, bigger fish to fry.

611
01:29:27,608 --> 01:29:29,508
How'd you know that stuff, anyway?

612
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:31,104
My son's one of you lot.

613
01:29:31,912 --> 01:29:33,607
I knew he'd see us through.

614
01:29:39,687 --> 01:29:40,687
You're RAF?

615
01:29:42,723 --> 01:29:44,588
No. Not me.

616
01:29:44,758 --> 01:29:48,091
My brother. He flew Hurricanes.

617
01:29:48,262 --> 01:29:49,854
Died third week into the war.

618
01:30:30,104 --> 01:30:32,163
No, stay downstairs, please.

619
01:30:32,806 --> 01:30:34,797
We just wanna see the cliffs.

620
01:30:41,749 --> 01:30:43,649
- Is it Dover?
- No.

621
01:30:44,218 --> 01:30:45,651
That's Dorset.

622
01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:47,778
But it's home.

623
01:30:49,790 --> 01:30:52,224
We let you all down, didn't we?

624
01:31:31,565 --> 01:31:34,432
Christ, how many you got in there?

625
01:31:52,453 --> 01:31:54,080
Make your way to the trains.

626
01:31:55,756 --> 01:31:57,348
Where the hell were you?

627
01:32:04,765 --> 01:32:06,460
They know where you were.

628
01:32:11,739 --> 01:32:12,739
Bye.

629
01:32:32,559 --> 01:32:33,924
Cup of tea?

630
01:32:35,863 --> 01:32:37,228
Cup of tea?

631
01:32:38,065 --> 01:32:40,795
Well done. Well done.

632
01:32:41,235 --> 01:32:42,361
Well done, lads.

633
01:32:42,503 --> 01:32:45,131
Well done. Well done, lads.

634
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:47,798
Well done.

635
01:32:48,408 --> 01:32:50,069
All we did is survive.

636
01:32:50,744 --> 01:32:52,143
That's enough.

637
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:00,920
Well done.

638
01:33:02,089 --> 01:33:03,386
Well done.

639
01:33:14,535 --> 01:33:17,003
That old bloke wouldn't even
look us in the eye.

640
01:33:37,357 --> 01:33:39,291
Come on, private!

641
01:33:40,194 --> 01:33:44,790
I know we're officers,
but it's us or the enemy.

642
01:33:45,866 --> 01:33:48,198
So now is not the time to be particular.

643
01:33:51,839 --> 01:33:54,467
Well, Churchill got his 30,000.

644
01:33:54,641 --> 01:33:55,938
And then some.

645
01:33:56,810 --> 01:33:58,869
Almost 300,000.

646
01:34:02,316 --> 01:34:03,544
So far.

647
01:34:04,952 --> 01:34:05,976
So far?

648
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:07,748
I'm staying.

649
01:34:08,956 --> 01:34:10,321
For the French.

650
01:35:03,944 --> 01:35:05,343
Hey!

651
01:35:05,512 --> 01:35:06,672
Where are we?

652
01:35:06,813 --> 01:35:09,611
Siding. You'll be pulling in in a minute.

653
01:35:09,783 --> 01:35:11,250
What station?

654
01:35:11,418 --> 01:35:12,908
Woking.

655
01:35:13,553 --> 01:35:15,180
Grab me one of them papers.

656
01:35:15,422 --> 01:35:16,548
Go on!

657
01:35:30,404 --> 01:35:31,803
Can't bear it.

658
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:34,800
You read it.

659
01:35:35,609 --> 01:35:36,609
Can't bear it?

660
01:35:37,244 --> 01:35:39,439
They'll be spitting at us in the streets.

661
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:43,313
If they're not locked up
waiting for the invasion.

662
01:36:29,863 --> 01:36:32,331
"Wars are not won by evacuations."

663
01:36:36,136 --> 01:36:37,467
I can't look.

664
01:36:37,838 --> 01:36:41,838
"But there was a victory inside this
deliverance, which should be noted."

665
01:36:48,782 --> 01:36:50,716
"Our thankfulness at the
escape of our army"

666
01:36:50,884 --> 01:36:53,318
"must not blind us to the fact
that what has happened"

667
01:36:53,487 --> 01:36:57,048
"in France and Belgium
is a colossal military disaster."

668
01:37:14,641 --> 01:37:17,974
"We must expect another blow
to be struck almost immediately."

669
01:37:36,863 --> 01:37:38,558
"We shall go on to the end."

670
01:37:42,569 --> 01:37:44,503
"We shall fight in France."

671
01:37:46,006 --> 01:37:48,497
"We shall fight on the seas and oceans."

672
01:38:03,523 --> 01:38:07,050
"We shall fight with growing confidence
and growing strength in the air."

673
01:38:14,734 --> 01:38:16,654
"We shall defend our island
whatever the cost..."

674
01:38:16,678 --> 01:38:17,459
What?

675
01:38:17,637 --> 01:38:20,731
"We shall defend our island
whatever the cost may be."

676
01:38:21,174 --> 01:38:23,233
"We shall fight on the beaches."

677
01:38:23,410 --> 01:38:25,010
"We shall fight on the landing grounds."

678
01:38:25,045 --> 01:38:27,036
"We shall fight in the fields
and in the streets."

679
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:28,380
"We shall fight in the hills."

680
01:38:29,583 --> 01:38:31,244
"We shall never surrender."

681
01:38:43,396 --> 01:38:45,830
"And even if this island
or a large part of it"

682
01:38:45,999 --> 01:38:47,762
"were subjugated and staring,"

683
01:38:47,934 --> 01:38:51,995
"then our Empire beyond the seas,
armed and guarded by the British Fleet,"

684
01:38:52,172 --> 01:38:54,197
"would carry on the struggle"

685
01:38:54,641 --> 01:38:57,576
"until, in God's good time,"

686
01:38:57,744 --> 01:38:59,974
"the New World, with all
its power and might,"

687
01:39:00,147 --> 01:39:03,810
"steps forth to the rescue
and the liberation of the old."
