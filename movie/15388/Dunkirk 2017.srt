任 ... 任務? 這 ... 這可是艘遊艇!

279
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:21,210
You're weekend sailors, not the bloody navy.
你們 ... 你們只是業餘水手 又不是海軍!

280
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,510
A man your age?

Men my age dictate this war.
像我這把年紀的人 有些正在主導這場戰爭

282
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:29,320
Why should we be allowed to send our children to fight it?
我們又憑什麼 只讓年輕人去戰鬥?

283
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:31,260
You should be at home!
你就該待家媕Y!

284
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:34,990
Well, there won't be any home if we allow a slaughter across the Channel.
如果這場戰爭蔓延到英國 我也就無家可歸了

285
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,670
He's turning tail. I'm gonna get after him.
他掉頭逃了 我去追他

286
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,670

291
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,780
Oi! No! No!

292
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,650
Get off! Get off!
一邊去!

293
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,060
Piss off, the both of you. It's too crowded.
滾開 船上太擠了!

294
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:12,460
You can't leave us!

Make some room!
騰騰位子!

No! Get off!
一邊去!

298
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,500
You men, leave off. You'll capsize the boat.
你們快住手 船會翻掉的

She's gone over twice on the way out here.
來這的路上已經翻過兩次了

You have to stay calm. There are plenty of boats.
冷靜下來 船是夠用的

301
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:24,800
Calm?
冷靜?!

302
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,240
Wait till you get torpedoed, then tell us to be calm!
等你也被魚雷炸了 再來扯這個吧!

303
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,080
You have life jackets?

304
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,540
Yes, they do.

We're heading back to the beach.

這船沒法渡過海峽 夥計們

我們得回到海灘上 等下一班船

311

There's no hiding from this, son.

What is it you think you can do out there, on this thing?
你以為你們能幫到什麼?  就憑這玩意?

我們不是孤軍作戰 號令下來了

We aren't the only ones to answer, you know.

Do you have a gun?

326
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:33,400
Yes, of course. A rifle, a 303.
有 當然了! 來復步槍 303口徑

327
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:36,600
Did it help you against the dive bombers and the U-boats?
它能幫你回擊俯衝轟炸機嗎? U型潛艇呢?

328
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:39,510
You're an old fool.
你真是個老糊塗

329
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,550
I'm not going back.

338
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:02,060
George?
喬治?

339
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:03,900
George!

340
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:07,700
What have you done?
你都做了什麼?

341
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:10,880
Okay, you're all right, George.

342
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:12,780
You're all right.
你沒事的!

343
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,510
Hang on. Okay. Okay, just...
堅持住

344
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,180
That's it. That's good enough.
好的 現在

345
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,260
It's gonna keep some pressure on. There we go.
要給你壓一下 好了

346
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:23,020
There we go.

Come on, lads!

349
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:04,590
Come on! Come on, boys!
加把勁 夥計們

350
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,240
It's a pier.
等到海水漲起來

351
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:13,910
For when the water comes in.
就把它當碼頭用

352
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:19,850
The tide's turning now.
現在在漲潮了

353
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:22,910
How can you tell?
你怎麼知道?

354
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,860
The bodies come back.
屍體都漂回來了

355
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:58,680
Hey.
嘿!

356
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,700
Hey, Highlanders!
嘿! 高地兵們!

357
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,280
Hey, Highlanders!
嘿! 高地兵們!

358
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:25,650
What's that way?
那邊是什麼?

359
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,150
A boat.
有艘船

360
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:28,250
She's grounded.
擱淺了

361
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:31,120
Not when the tide comes in, she's not.
等到漲潮後 就不是了

362
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:51,010
Be a brave lad.
挺住 兄弟

363
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:55,020
You and Mr. Dawson?
遇見你和道森先生

364
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,350
It's the best thing I've ever done.

365
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:01,690
You're all right. You're okay.

366
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:15,260
Sea Cadet. It's the only thing I've ever done.
參加海事青年團 那是我做過的唯一一件事了

367
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,570
It's all right. It's okay. Just have some water.
沒事的 好了 喝口水吧

368
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,110
I told my dad...
我跟父親說過

369
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,440
I've done nothing at school
我在學校媮鷁M一事無成

370
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:28,510
and that I would do something one day.
可總有一天會混出點名堂

371
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,790
Maybe get in the local paper.
也許會登上本地報紙

372
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,220
Maybe my teachers would see it.
也許老師們會讀到我的報道

373
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:37,950
Okay, get some rest.
好了 休息一下

374
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,120
I need you back up on deck as soon as you're able.
等你恢復了 甲板上我還需要你

375
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,390
I can't.
做不到

376
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:45,660
What?
什麼?

377
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:50,900
I can't see.
我看不見了

378
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:51,820
Sir.
長官

379
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,640
The French have been forced back on the western side.
西側的法軍已經被迫後撤了

380
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:57,900
They're still holding a perimeter?
但原來的防線還在吧?

381
00:54:58,070 --> 00:54:59,060
For now.
目前是的

382
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,700
Officer coming through. Move yourselves. Move yourselves!
給長官讓路 都讓讓 讓讓!

383
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,050
Where are the destroyers?
驅逐艦在哪?

384
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:16,750
There'll be one soon.
很快會再來一艘

385
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:20,850
One?
一艘?

386
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,590
After yesterday's losses, it's one ship on the mole at a time.
經過昨天的損失 現在一次就來一艘了

387
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:24,830
The battle is here.
這就是戰場

388
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,490
What the hell are they saving them for?
他們藏著船究竟想做什麼?

389
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:28,140
The next battle.
為了以後的戰鬥

390
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:29,770
The one for Britain.
為了保衛不列顛

391
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,870
It's the same with the planes.
飛機也一樣

392
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:35,640
But it's right there.
可英國近在眼前!

393
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:37,340
You can practically...
你幾乎可以看 ...

394
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:39,570
Seeing home doesn't help us get there, Colonel.
就算看得到 也不意味著你能平安返家 上尉

395
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,680
They need to send more ships.
那邊得增派更多船隻

396
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,180
Every hour the enemy pushes closer.
敵人時刻都在逼近

397
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,010
They've activated the small vessels pool.
當局已經啟用"小型運力池"來增援了

398
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:48,980
Small vessels?
"小型運力"

399
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,630
It's the list of civilian boats for requisition.
也就是徵召民船

400
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:53,120
Civilian?
民船?

401
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:56,690
We need destroyers.
我們要的是驅逐艦

402
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:58,630
Small boats can load from the beach.
小船可以到海灘上載人

403
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,030
Not in these conditions.
但現在不合適

404
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,690
Well, I'd rather face waves than dive bombers.
比起俯衝轟炸 我寧願它波浪滔天

405
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,440
No, you're right. They won't get up in this.
說的沒錯 這海況沒法出航 ...

406
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:12,540
The Royal Engineers are building piers from lorries.
皇家工兵團在用卡車搭建臨時碼頭

407
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,340
At least that should help us when the tide comes back.
起碼在漲潮後能派上用場

408
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,680
Well, we'll know in six hours' time.
我們只有6個小時

409
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:20,120
I thought the tides were every three?
不是3小時一次漲潮嗎?

410
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:24,720
Then it's good that you're army and I'm navy, isn't it?
所以才說 你是陸軍 我是海軍 對吧?

411
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,490
There. Vanquisher.
那兒 "征服者"號驅逐艦 ...

412
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:44,510
Where's the crew?
船員去哪兒了?

413
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,550
Probably got spooked after they ran aground.
可能是擱淺後害怕了

414
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:48,870
Scarpered up the beach.
逃到了海灘上

415
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:50,340
Why?
為什麼?

416
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,720
'Cause we're outside the perimeter. Enemy could be right there.
因為我們在防線外頭 敵人可能就在附近

417
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:57,330
All right, best shut ourselves inside, boys.

One man's not going to make enough difference.
