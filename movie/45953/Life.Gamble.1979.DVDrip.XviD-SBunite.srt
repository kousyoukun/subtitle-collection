1
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,957
Please make a set of weapons for me

2
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,161
Seven deadly daggers

3
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:04,565
Sorry, I'm no expert. I can't do it

4
00:02:05,486 --> 00:02:07,888
You're too humble

5
00:02:07,968 --> 00:02:11,372
I've spent 3 months in search of an expert

6
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:13,934
at shaping weapons

7
00:02:14,054 --> 00:02:16,296
Who else but you
could be ideal for the job?

8
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:27,428
Brother Qiu,
I've brought along the payment too

9
00:02:27,508 --> 00:02:28,429
Please don't refuse

10
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:31,872
You've got the wrong person,
my name isn't Qiu

11
00:02:31,992 --> 00:02:33,394
And neither do I know how to make daggers

12
00:02:33,474 --> 00:02:35,436
Qiu Zi Yu, everyone knows that

13
00:02:35,516 --> 00:02:37,758
you are a well-known weapons artisan

14
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:41,081
All friends in the martial arts world

15
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:43,724
who use your weapons are world famous

16
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:46,286
Three years ago you disappeared

17
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:49,770
I've spent a lot of effort in finding you

18
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,092
why do you refuse me?

19
00:02:57,297 --> 00:02:58,659
You really have got the wrong person

20
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,862
I only know how to make farm implements

21
00:03:02,743 --> 00:03:05,866
You sell your expertise and
I'm looking for fine daggers

22
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,027
Your fine handicraft

23
00:03:07,147 --> 00:03:08,749
worn around my waist

24
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:10,631
is definitely not an insult to you

25
00:03:14,114 --> 00:03:15,636
If you refuse

26
00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:17,237
I'll kill your student first

27
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:18,639
Would Mo Jun Feng

28
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,801
a swordsman of great repute

29
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:21,882
do such a thing?

30
00:03:21,962 --> 00:03:23,283
Yes

31
00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:26,126
No

32
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:28,929
I'll keep waiting for your reply

33
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:32,453
I told you
I don't know anything about blades

34
00:03:36,497 --> 00:03:37,618
"Ironsmith"

35
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,183
Hey, have a look,
it seems the wheel is broken

36
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,832
Yes, it has to be changed

37
00:03:51,912 --> 00:03:52,793
How long will it take?

38
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:54,315
One whole day

39
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:05,686
Fix it quickly

40
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,372
Mo Jun Feng

41
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:14,935
Xiao Qiang, how come you are here?

42
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:16,537
And you?

43
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:17,778
I was just passing by

44
00:04:17,898 --> 00:04:19,299
On my way I heard that

45
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,023
various people are after you

46
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:24,665
Once they catch up, you'll die

47
00:04:24,785 --> 00:04:27,147
Me? Die?

48
00:04:27,828 --> 00:04:30,631
It's hard to believe

49
00:04:30,711 --> 00:04:33,233
You have 7 deadly daggers

50
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,035
who would dare come near you?

51
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:39,920
It's rumoured Mo Jun Feng's sword
and Xiao Qiang's smile

52
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,882
are the deadliest weapons

53
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:43,484
I am honoured

54
00:04:43,564 --> 00:04:48,729
My smile is still here
but your sword is gone

55
00:04:50,571 --> 00:04:55,095
There was no sword to start with

56
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,063
It's no use to look for Qiu Zi Yu

57
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:07,748
You know about this too?

58
00:05:07,868 --> 00:05:10,230
3 years ago Qiu Zi Yu forged

59
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:12,192
a good sword for Yan Zi Fei

60
00:05:16,196 --> 00:05:18,679
Brilliant...

61
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,242
You are the best in light technique,

62
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:25,886
Yan Zi Fei

63
00:05:33,694 --> 00:05:35,976
You needn't remind me

64
00:05:36,096 --> 00:05:38,098
I wouldn't forget your rules

65
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:41,061
A technique for a weapon

66
00:05:41,181 --> 00:05:42,943
you have made me this sword

67
00:05:43,063 --> 00:05:44,745
so I must teach you

68
00:05:44,865 --> 00:05:47,788
my humble technique

69
00:05:47,868 --> 00:05:49,430
Thank you

70
00:05:57,237 --> 00:05:58,799
Qiu Zi Yu is seriously wounded

71
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,483
and disappeared since

72
00:06:02,603 --> 00:06:06,607
There is no Qiu Zi Yu now

73
00:06:07,448 --> 00:06:10,331
I am the only solution to your problem

74
00:06:10,451 --> 00:06:11,452
You?

75
00:06:11,932 --> 00:06:13,614
Shall we talk business?

76
00:06:13,694 --> 00:06:14,855
Let's hear it

77
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:18,178
There's a large deal
which I can't handle alone

78
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:20,581
and you're the ideal partner

79
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:23,744
It sounds arrogant of you

80
00:06:23,864 --> 00:06:26,667
to ask swordsman Mo Jun Feng
to be your help

81
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:28,589
You be my help

82
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:31,312
As a reward I'll get your 7 daggers

83
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:34,555
"Fu Lai Inn"

84
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,280
Master Tang, your room is over there

85
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:00,140
Mo Jun Feng

86
00:07:11,592 --> 00:07:13,834
I stole his flying daggers

87
00:07:13,914 --> 00:07:14,955
If he knew

88
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:18,399
Wouldn't I die?

89
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,524
What do you have in mind?
What do I have to do?

90
00:07:24,284 --> 00:07:27,608
Besides killing, what do you know?

91
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,813
What else would I know?

92
00:07:33,173 --> 00:07:35,095
Who is the target?

93
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,657
There are 4 of them

94
00:07:38,298 --> 00:07:40,821
They are Jin Ba, the Chief,

95
00:07:41,822 --> 00:07:43,544
Cheng Zhang Po, the Silver Leopard

96
00:07:44,345 --> 00:07:46,146
Wu Hao, the Little King Kong,

97
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:49,630
Zhen Liu Xiang, the Golden Hairpin

98
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,922
This is the famous He Huan Jade

99
00:08:02,202 --> 00:08:04,325
Not bad, almost 3 inches

100
00:08:04,445 --> 00:08:06,527
Honourably entrenched in a spiral form

101
00:08:06,647 --> 00:08:09,209
It originated from the Han dynasty

102
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,733
and was hidden in the palace

103
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,736
This is the king of jade

104
00:08:15,856 --> 00:08:17,658
and is worth 500,000 taels of silver

105
00:08:17,738 --> 00:08:20,501
If we find a good buyer, it's worth more

106
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:23,464
How do we split the loot?

107
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,307
We can't split the jade

108
00:08:27,428 --> 00:08:29,430
so we'll split the money from the sale

109
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,032
Each one will just get over 100,000 taels

110
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:32,953
What's there to split?

111
00:08:33,073 --> 00:08:34,995
These belong to the Nan family

112
00:08:35,075 --> 00:08:37,478
In Northern provinces
they head the martial arts world

113
00:08:37,598 --> 00:08:40,160
Nan Yu, the eldest son,
is great in kung fu

114
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,162
If we make such an enemy

115
00:08:42,282 --> 00:08:44,445
even each of us got
hundred thousand taels of silver

116
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:47,808
Jin Ba and I think it is not worth it

117
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:49,089
He is right

118
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:52,573
Since Jin Ba and brother Cheng
don't want to split

119
00:08:52,693 --> 00:08:54,415
I have an idea

120
00:08:54,495 --> 00:08:57,137
Let's gamble

121
00:08:57,257 --> 00:08:59,820
whoever wins, gets the jade

122
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,144
Good idea. You think
Xiao Wu will listen to Liu Xiang?

123
00:09:04,264 --> 00:09:05,506
Of course

124
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:07,147
Zhang Bo, how about you?

125
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:08,268
I agree

126
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:12,032
500,000 taels is a large sum anyhow

127
00:09:12,112 --> 00:09:13,954
where are we going to gamble this?

128
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:16,036
You might have

129
00:09:16,116 --> 00:09:18,639
heard of the Golden Lion

130
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,761
Mao Kai Yuan, the gambling king

131
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:23,644
Yes, he is the king of gambling

132
00:09:23,724 --> 00:09:26,847
He runs a famous gambling business
in Guangdong

133
00:09:26,927 --> 00:09:29,890
Presently he has a resort here

134
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,291
where he relaxes

135
00:09:31,412 --> 00:09:34,335
It is called the Lion Rock

136
00:09:34,855 --> 00:09:37,418
The four of them decided to

137
00:09:37,498 --> 00:09:40,140
gamble for the jade

138
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,343
They asked the Golden Lion

139
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:45,065
to be the banker

140
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,788
Then I don't need to do anything

141
00:09:47,868 --> 00:09:50,311
Though the final outcome depends on
who wins

142
00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:52,473
these 4 people

143
00:09:53,354 --> 00:09:57,518
will eventually kill each other

144
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,879
One will be left

145
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:02,443
It would be the Golden Lion, Mao Kai Yuan

146
00:10:06,046 --> 00:10:09,570
It doesn't matter who gets the jade

147
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,052
it will eventually be mine

148
00:10:12,493 --> 00:10:14,094
"Lion Rock"

149
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:28,509
Green Dragon

150
00:10:32,152 --> 00:10:33,153
White Tiger

151
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:50,050
Shuang Shuang

152
00:10:56,136 --> 00:10:58,539
All ready?

153
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,301
Are these the 4 guests to be served?

154
00:11:01,422 --> 00:11:04,865
If you have no confidence
don't look for me

155
00:11:04,945 --> 00:11:08,268
These 4 are difficult guests

156
00:11:08,349 --> 00:11:11,872
Are you afraid of them?

157
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:13,834
Of course

158
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:18,238
They are not easy to deal with

159
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:24,084
Do you plan to get the jade from them?

160
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,528
What are you talking about?

161
00:11:27,648 --> 00:11:31,852
Once the gambling starts,
my part is finished

162
00:11:31,932 --> 00:11:36,056
I don't want to see such bloody scene

163
00:11:36,136 --> 00:11:38,459
Pay up first

164
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:42,182
Okay, I'll ask accounts
to give you the cheque

165
00:11:43,464 --> 00:11:44,785
I want the payment in silver

166
00:11:44,865 --> 00:11:46,306
You don't believe in our cheque?

167
00:11:46,427 --> 00:11:48,108
It's not that

168
00:11:48,228 --> 00:11:53,113
But if the issuer dies

169
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:58,479
then I can't cash it

170
00:12:26,907 --> 00:12:28,148
Yun Xiang

171
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:32,953
When Peng Shuang Shuang leaves,

172
00:12:33,073 --> 00:12:35,235
this sword will pierce her heart

173
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:38,639
within 10 paces from the door

174
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:39,640
Good

175
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,083
Hang on... my payment

176
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:47,648
All of it, I want it now

177
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:51,051
Back in Guangdong, when I took you in

178
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:53,894
you were only a petty beggar

179
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:54,655
but now...

180
00:12:54,735 --> 00:12:58,539
Yes, you raised me for the last 10 years

181
00:12:58,659 --> 00:13:01,181
but I also killed 10 people for you

182
00:13:01,662 --> 00:13:04,425
Guess we don't owe each other anything

183
00:13:04,505 --> 00:13:06,747
Alright, I'll give you

184
00:13:06,867 --> 00:13:09,229
Why do you want the money right away?

185
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:11,832
Because Mo Jun Feng and Xiao Qiang

186
00:13:11,952 --> 00:13:14,395
suddenly came to town

187
00:13:14,475 --> 00:13:18,118
Fear I mightn't get an opportunity
to ask you for money

188
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:34,895
That explains the delightful laughter

189
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:38,459
I wonder what

190
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:40,020
I could do for you at this late hour?

191
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,423
Let me introduce a friend to you

192
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:50,270
Who else could it be with you but

193
00:13:50,391 --> 00:13:53,113
Xiao Tang the Deadly Whip?

194
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,356
You are quite observant

195
00:13:56,757 --> 00:13:58,158
Just now you asked why I'm here

196
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:00,601
You do know that Qiu Zi Yu isn't dead

197
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:01,522
I didn't

198
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:05,205
Qiu Zi Yu is discouraged
and lives in hiding

199
00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:07,848
He is now a blacksmith in our town

200
00:14:07,928 --> 00:14:09,450
He never speaks of the martial arts

201
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,452
or makes any weapons

202
00:14:11,532 --> 00:14:12,573
Even better

203
00:14:12,693 --> 00:14:15,936
He'll never make another sword like mine

204
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,097
for someone else

205
00:14:17,217 --> 00:14:20,621
But I have some business with Qiu Zi Yu

206
00:14:20,701 --> 00:14:23,143
and it is opportune Xiao Tang's whip

207
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:25,506
could subdue your sword

208
00:14:25,626 --> 00:14:29,510
So I take the liberty to ask you
to lend me one thing

209
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,352
to ease Qiu Zi Yu's anger

210
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:35,155
Well, as long as you defeat me

211
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:38,559
you could even have my head

212
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:42,042
No need for that, a hand will do

213
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:55,275
How much to fix the cart?

214
00:15:55,676 --> 00:15:57,438
One tael of silver

215
00:15:57,518 --> 00:15:59,119
Let's talk of another deal

216
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:02,843
what's the cost to make
7 daggers for Mr Mo?

217
00:16:02,923 --> 00:16:05,165
I don't make blades

218
00:16:06,246 --> 00:16:07,207
Qiu Zi Yu

219
00:16:07,328 --> 00:16:10,371
I know why you discontinued making weapons

220
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:14,014
I'll give you something to cure you

221
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:25,025
Look, whose hand is this?

222
00:16:25,105 --> 00:16:27,828
This is the hand which held the sword that

223
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:30,030
pierced your heart 3 years ago

224
00:16:30,431 --> 00:16:32,393
3 years ago?

225
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:37,998
Miss, Qiu Zi Yu has long gone

226
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:39,360
The one before you

227
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,882
is merely a simple blacksmith

228
00:16:41,962 --> 00:16:44,204
Stop hassling him please

229
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,173
Let's go

230
00:16:53,694 --> 00:16:55,055
You don't want your daggers?

231
00:16:55,135 --> 00:16:56,737
He wouldn't make them for me

232
00:16:56,857 --> 00:16:58,819
It's a sad affair for him

233
00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:19,400
Yan Zi Fei, what are you doing here?

234
00:17:20,321 --> 00:17:22,603
I'll ask you 3 questions

235
00:17:25,446 --> 00:17:26,887
Has Xiao Qiang been here?

236
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,732
What did she bring you?

237
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:36,777
Your hand

238
00:17:38,699 --> 00:17:39,820
You hate me, isn't it?

239
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,021
No

240
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:45,626
No? You were almost killed by me

241
00:17:45,746 --> 00:17:49,470
The sword I used to pierce you
is your masterpiece

242
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,672
You have lived as a hermit from then on

243
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:53,674
Why don't you hate me?

244
00:17:53,754 --> 00:17:54,995
I'm sorry

245
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:58,319
I've already answered your three questions

246
00:18:04,565 --> 00:18:07,488
Pal, I have business with the blacksmith

247
00:18:07,568 --> 00:18:08,889
Please excuse us

248
00:18:16,577 --> 00:18:19,460
Master Nan would like to invite you over

249
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,302
You must go

250
00:18:25,065 --> 00:18:28,749
Nan family is well-known
in the martial arts world

251
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:30,791
Would Master Nan kidnap me?

252
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:32,633
Master instructed that

253
00:18:32,713 --> 00:18:35,075
we should invite you over at all costs

254
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,837
I won't go even if you threaten my life

255
00:18:42,042 --> 00:18:43,243
Do you keep iron-toothed rakes?

256
00:18:43,324 --> 00:18:44,284
Yes

257
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:56,296
This rake is good, how much?

258
00:19:05,986 --> 00:19:09,109
What a rake, nice weapon it'd make

259
00:19:09,229 --> 00:19:13,273
Qiu Zi Yu,
you said you won't make any weapons

260
00:19:13,394 --> 00:19:15,115
So all this is false

261
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:19,880
Look, this rake fits me well

262
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:34,054
Look, not only is this rake
a deadly weapon

263
00:19:34,134 --> 00:19:35,856
this great hammer is one too

264
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:39,219
if you hit me with it

265
00:19:43,303 --> 00:19:46,907
Qiu Zi Yu,
your fists are deadly weapons too

266
00:19:47,027 --> 00:19:50,391
I don't believe
you can get rid of your fists too?

267
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:56,877
Who are you?

268
00:19:56,957 --> 00:20:01,442
You were once eminent
in the martial arts world

269
00:20:01,522 --> 00:20:03,644
You should have good eyesight

270
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:05,526
I've heard that

271
00:20:05,646 --> 00:20:08,929
recently a young man appeared

272
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:11,692
He is powerful and ferocious

273
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:14,054
his name is Wu Hao, the Little King Kong

274
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:16,457
You really have good eyesight

275
00:20:16,537 --> 00:20:19,980
Qiu Zi Yu,
I'm afraid you can't go be a hermit

276
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,223
How about come out again and make...

277
00:20:23,303 --> 00:20:24,465
Shut up

278
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:59,059
Master Nan, are you looking for me?

279
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:02,062
I'm here on purpose

280
00:21:02,182 --> 00:21:06,226
I've got some
private business to talk to you

281
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:09,950
Your four men...

282
00:21:12,553 --> 00:21:15,796
I know, Robber Wu Hao has killed them

283
00:21:15,876 --> 00:21:18,799
I've ordered someone to get their bodies

284
00:21:37,658 --> 00:21:39,299
That's how it is

285
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,261
My family runs several businesses

286
00:21:41,382 --> 00:21:43,223
Security bureau is one of them

287
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:46,547
Owner of He Huan Jade hired us
to escort the jade

288
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:49,069
Unfortunately,
it was robbed by the four villains

289
00:21:49,189 --> 00:21:50,631
Now these four villains

290
00:21:50,711 --> 00:21:52,913
are with the Golden Lion

291
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:55,956
They must be watching my activities

292
00:21:56,076 --> 00:21:57,478
and so I can't retrieve it unnoticed

293
00:21:57,558 --> 00:21:59,239
If I gather men to
take it back by force openly

294
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,602
it might cause catastrophe

295
00:22:01,682 --> 00:22:03,484
and many may lose their lives

296
00:22:03,604 --> 00:22:06,567
The only option is using someone
who does it discreetly

297
00:22:06,687 --> 00:22:08,569
I understand

298
00:22:08,689 --> 00:22:10,491
In the past you made weapons for

299
00:22:10,611 --> 00:22:12,012
many gangsters

300
00:22:12,092 --> 00:22:15,255
Guilt overcame your conscience
and you got discouraged

301
00:22:15,336 --> 00:22:18,659
In fact, if weapons were used properly

302
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:20,180
they could still do a lot of good

303
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,222
for the martial arts world

304
00:22:22,302 --> 00:22:26,226
Great things if not done in one's lifetime

305
00:22:26,306 --> 00:22:28,709
that will be passed on
from generation to generation

306
00:22:28,829 --> 00:22:32,513
then it would be a real waste and a shame

307
00:22:32,633 --> 00:22:35,876
Master Nan,
I've left the martial arts world

308
00:22:35,996 --> 00:22:37,398
Please ask someone else

309
00:22:37,478 --> 00:22:39,720
Brother Qiu, if you change your mind

310
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,442
please come to Dong Gang

311
00:22:41,562 --> 00:22:43,564
someone will be in touch with you

312
00:23:01,862 --> 00:23:02,903
Shuang Shuang

313
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:12,232
Did you seduce Xiao Qiang

314
00:23:12,312 --> 00:23:14,475
or was it vice versa?

315
00:23:22,763 --> 00:23:27,688
You were nobody when I was with you

316
00:23:27,768 --> 00:23:33,093
Now that you've lost your daggers,
I'm here once again

317
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:36,056
this shows my sincerity

318
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,699
Let's get together tonight

319
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:41,101
I'm at the Fu Lai Inn

320
00:23:41,221 --> 00:23:45,586
Upstairs

321
00:23:55,876 --> 00:23:56,717
Xiao Hong

322
00:23:56,837 --> 00:23:59,279
Brother Qiu, quick move

323
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,082
Though in hiding,
your kung fu remains powerful

324
00:24:02,162 --> 00:24:04,084
Don't bring it up, why are you here?

325
00:24:04,164 --> 00:24:05,165
Dad brought me here

326
00:24:05,285 --> 00:24:06,487
Your dad is here too?

327
00:24:25,105 --> 00:24:27,788
Qiu Zi Yu, you holed up quite well

328
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:30,911
but I can still find you

329
00:24:33,073 --> 00:24:35,155
If you want to find someone

330
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:37,197
who could hide from you?

331
00:24:41,281 --> 00:24:43,404
Are you arresting me?

332
00:24:43,484 --> 00:24:46,246
Arrest you? What have you done?

333
00:24:48,449 --> 00:24:53,293
I'm here because of the He Huan Jade

334
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:56,857
I knew that Master Nan

335
00:24:56,977 --> 00:24:59,340
came to you

336
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,542
Whatever he said to you,

337
00:25:01,662 --> 00:25:04,625
Xiao Hong and I already knew it

338
00:25:05,466 --> 00:25:08,869
I hope you won't refuse him

339
00:25:08,989 --> 00:25:09,470
No can do

340
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,792
What if I beg you on his behalf?

341
00:25:12,593 --> 00:25:13,193
You?

342
00:25:13,273 --> 00:25:15,195
Brother Qiu, please agree just this once

343
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:18,038
What do you want me to do?

344
00:25:18,158 --> 00:25:20,080
We attack from within and outwards

345
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:22,883
to get the He Huan Jade and
give it to Master Nan

346
00:25:46,787 --> 00:25:48,989
Xiao Qiang can't help you much

347
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:53,674
but I can help you find your seven daggers

348
00:25:53,794 --> 00:25:56,557
I'll help whoever helps me find
the daggers

349
00:25:56,677 --> 00:25:59,079
Really? Let bygones be bygones?

350
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:00,160
Yes

351
00:26:01,642 --> 00:26:05,966
I must go back or else
someone will be jealous

352
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,544
Don't hide, it's me

353
00:26:24,945 --> 00:26:27,227
Shuang Shuang, you'll be the death of me

354
00:26:27,348 --> 00:26:29,390
You told me to steal Mo Jun Feng's daggers

355
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:32,993
He is just next door

356
00:26:33,073 --> 00:26:34,955
but I am sick and can't move

357
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:41,522
Stop pretending

358
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,844
I'm just afraid that
you might have other ideas

359
00:26:43,964 --> 00:26:46,367
But you can rest assured

360
00:26:46,487 --> 00:26:49,810
Mo Jun Feng doesn't know yet:
Where are the daggers?

361
00:27:03,744 --> 00:27:05,666
What about the reward you promised me?

362
00:27:06,387 --> 00:27:10,711
It is not the kind you have in mind

363
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:12,072
Take it

364
00:27:15,275 --> 00:27:16,517
It's here

365
00:27:16,877 --> 00:27:20,040
I know you wouldn't give it to me

366
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,083
so I helped myself to it

367
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,571
You?

368
00:27:31,091 --> 00:27:32,733
Xiao Tang the Deadly Whip

369
00:27:34,014 --> 00:27:36,056
Xiao Qiang's carriage driver

370
00:27:38,379 --> 00:27:42,302
This is to remind you
to be careful with your words

371
00:27:44,304 --> 00:27:46,747
What about this one then?

372
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:48,869
Distance yourself from Mo Jun Feng

373
00:27:48,989 --> 00:27:50,110
I want a man

374
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,672
Find someone else

375
00:27:55,956 --> 00:27:57,237
Who?

376
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:03,924
No one except you

377
00:28:45,566 --> 00:28:46,687
Chief Constable Xiao

378
00:28:47,207 --> 00:28:49,730
There is a penalty for murder

379
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,613
if I meet up with

380
00:28:52,693 --> 00:28:54,335
the righteous Xiao Zi Jing I am dead

381
00:28:54,455 --> 00:28:58,298
But it can be said
you killed him as you had no choice

382
00:28:58,379 --> 00:28:59,820
he wanted to rape you

383
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,141
I see

384
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:05,426
My fate depends on you

385
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:09,630
What do you want?

386
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,473
Bring me to the Lion Rock
to join in the game

387
00:29:12,593 --> 00:29:15,235
That... is too risky

388
00:29:15,356 --> 00:29:16,997
I am willing to take the risk

389
00:29:17,077 --> 00:29:20,681
Mao Kai Yuan asked you
to take care of his 4 guests

390
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,923
he won't notice
how many girls you've brought

391
00:29:23,043 --> 00:29:24,605
Peng Shuang Shuang, you...

392
00:29:24,685 --> 00:29:28,449
I have to listen to you to survive

393
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:30,290
I understand it well

394
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:35,215
That's good. I'll take care of it

395
00:29:42,703 --> 00:29:45,185
I'm going, you needn't get up

396
00:30:06,046 --> 00:30:07,888
Waiter, a pot of wine

397
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:13,854
Blacksmith, how are you today?

398
00:30:14,254 --> 00:30:16,337
Come and have a drink

399
00:30:18,339 --> 00:30:21,301
That old gentleman looks alright

400
00:30:21,422 --> 00:30:23,023
he should have recovered

401
00:30:23,143 --> 00:30:26,226
but strangely enough
he said he still can't get up

402
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,430
I might still trouble you
to get him some medicine

403
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,911
Yes...

404
00:30:41,722 --> 00:30:44,685
Do something for me, find Xiao Tang

405
00:30:45,446 --> 00:30:48,809
I don't do favours easily

406
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:53,854
You claim you are Qiu Zi Yu?

407
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:03,183
Great... more wine...

408
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:15,075
Wonderful, the Deadly Whip is dead

409
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:17,478
Xiao Tang is dead?

410
00:31:17,598 --> 00:31:19,960
Yes, I saw his body

411
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,842
Upstairs of this tavern

412
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:24,044
So you're happy

413
00:31:24,164 --> 00:31:26,807
Of course,
if he hadn't tied me with his whip

414
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:29,129
how could you have cut off my hand?

415
00:31:32,573 --> 00:31:34,174
I have something important
to talk to you about

416
00:31:34,294 --> 00:31:35,295
Come with me

417
00:31:50,711 --> 00:31:51,792
What's this?

418
00:31:51,872 --> 00:31:53,113
You really don't hate me?

419
00:31:53,233 --> 00:31:55,796
Don't mention the past

420
00:31:55,876 --> 00:31:59,440
I regretted so much after I lost my hand

421
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,242
I did a lot of bad things before

422
00:32:02,322 --> 00:32:05,125
and I really want to repent

423
00:32:05,245 --> 00:32:07,688
You could start anew

424
00:32:07,808 --> 00:32:11,452
But I can't grow another hand

425
00:32:11,532 --> 00:32:15,936
Only you could help me make a fresh start

426
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:18,539
Use your fine workmanship

427
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:20,541
and make me an iron hand

428
00:32:20,661 --> 00:32:22,823
a hand that could do anything

429
00:32:22,903 --> 00:32:24,945
and let me be a new man

430
00:32:26,467 --> 00:32:27,868
The hand you make

431
00:32:27,948 --> 00:32:30,431
should be better than my natural hand

432
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:34,795
I wronged you once

433
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:39,199
but I am sincere in wanting to change,
please...

434
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,803
I promise you, in 3 days

435
00:32:42,883 --> 00:32:45,285
I could make a better hand

436
00:32:45,406 --> 00:32:48,128
But for this

437
00:32:48,248 --> 00:32:50,851
you have to do something for me

438
00:32:51,772 --> 00:32:53,454
I'll do what you say

439
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,903
Not like that, have to walk steadier

440
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:05,386
or the tea will be spilt

441
00:33:11,311 --> 00:33:12,953
How many times have I told you

442
00:33:13,073 --> 00:33:15,836
these guests are not ordinary people

443
00:33:15,916 --> 00:33:18,399
anything could happen

444
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:21,882
No matter what happens

445
00:33:21,962 --> 00:33:24,805
pretend you see and hear nothing

446
00:33:24,885 --> 00:33:25,886
Yes

447
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:33,454
You must be even more careful,
when the gambling starts

448
00:33:33,534 --> 00:33:35,656
you should be the only one to serve

449
00:33:35,736 --> 00:33:36,617
Yes

450
00:33:51,392 --> 00:33:53,434
You are the girl brought by
Peng Shuang Shuang?

451
00:33:54,835 --> 00:33:55,796
What's your name?

452
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:56,717
Xiao Hong

453
00:33:56,837 --> 00:34:03,163
Nice name

454
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:07,968
You are the gardener?

455
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:09,249
I am in charge of many things

456
00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:11,492
You must be marvellous then

457
00:34:29,029 --> 00:34:30,991
How did you know Peng Shuang Shuang?

458
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:33,113
She raised me

459
00:34:33,794 --> 00:34:35,516
You are also an orphan?

460
00:34:35,636 --> 00:34:39,480
I'm afraid I am not as capable as you

461
00:34:41,602 --> 00:34:43,484
What do you do?

462
00:34:44,645 --> 00:34:46,647
You would be scared if I told you

463
00:34:46,727 --> 00:34:49,410
I wouldn't

464
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:52,373
Look, I dare grab your hand

465
00:34:57,097 --> 00:35:00,341
I am a killer who kills for money

466
00:35:00,461 --> 00:35:03,624
You must be a great martial artist

467
00:35:03,704 --> 00:35:07,508
Xiao Hong, I am a killer, a bad person

468
00:35:07,628 --> 00:35:09,470
People are entitled to
their own consideration

469
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,832
You are not necessarily a bad person

470
00:35:15,516 --> 00:35:16,997
When will you be leaving?

471
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:20,040
I don't know, Miss Peng asked me to stay

472
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,002
and serve the customers
after the game has begun

473
00:35:22,082 --> 00:35:25,406
Xiao Hong, ask Shuang Shuang
to get someone else

474
00:35:25,486 --> 00:35:27,888
You can't deal with those guests

475
00:35:28,008 --> 00:35:29,049
Get someone else?

476
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:32,653
If there's danger then who would suffer

477
00:35:32,773 --> 00:35:36,417
You have a good heart,
but when the game starts

478
00:35:36,497 --> 00:35:38,659
anything could happen

479
00:35:38,779 --> 00:35:41,181
you might be killed

480
00:35:43,384 --> 00:35:45,586
But I won't let anything happen to you

481
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:47,588
I'll protect you in secret

482
00:36:03,283 --> 00:36:05,165
Sir, a guest has arrived

483
00:36:05,285 --> 00:36:06,166
Who is it?

484
00:36:06,286 --> 00:36:08,449
Mo Jun Feng the swordsman

485
00:36:10,731 --> 00:36:12,092
Ask him in, but no rush

486
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,173
Yes

487
00:36:27,267 --> 00:36:31,672
Someone is here,
wait for my signal behind the door

488
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:34,675
When I blow at the tea, make your move

489
00:36:34,795 --> 00:36:37,157
Here's your payment in silver

490
00:36:54,495 --> 00:36:56,256
Hero Mo, please

491
00:37:01,862 --> 00:37:02,903
Please sit

492
00:37:03,504 --> 00:37:04,505
Sorry to disturb you

493
00:37:05,145 --> 00:37:09,269
What can I do for
a famous swordsman like you?

494
00:37:10,871 --> 00:37:12,753
Even after you retire

495
00:37:12,873 --> 00:37:15,676
big business comes to your door

496
00:37:15,796 --> 00:37:17,237
My congratulations

497
00:37:17,317 --> 00:37:19,840
You'll be receiving 4 guests

498
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,644
News travels fast, but that's not business

499
00:37:23,724 --> 00:37:25,726
Just a few friends in a game

500
00:37:25,846 --> 00:37:27,808
I even have to pay for the food

501
00:37:27,888 --> 00:37:29,970
Ask Peng Shuang Shuang to come and serve

502
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:34,254
Make the guests comfortable
and show your hospitality

503
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,936
Spend a little and in return get

504
00:37:36,056 --> 00:37:38,739
the invaluable He Huan Jade

505
00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:40,421
Is this not big business?

506
00:37:40,501 --> 00:37:41,902
What do you mean?

507
00:37:42,022 --> 00:37:44,825
I want a share, obviously

508
00:37:44,905 --> 00:37:47,828
You still have the opportunity

509
00:37:47,908 --> 00:37:50,431
to take back that statement

510
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:56,156
you still have the opportunity
to discuss it with me

511
00:37:56,477 --> 00:38:00,080
I hear you've lost your daggers

512
00:38:00,961 --> 00:38:03,644
A swordsman without his blades...

513
00:38:04,805 --> 00:38:08,328
Just like your swordsman who is useless,

514
00:38:08,449 --> 00:38:09,650
right?

515
00:38:10,611 --> 00:38:14,535
But I've found my daggers

516
00:38:14,655 --> 00:38:15,696
Really?

517
00:38:15,816 --> 00:38:18,699
You could bet on it

518
00:38:22,663 --> 00:38:28,028
Let me see your daggers
if you want a share

519
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:33,153
That's not my character

520
00:38:33,273 --> 00:38:35,436
You may bet on it if you wish

521
00:38:35,516 --> 00:38:39,880
I am in town, you could look for me,
goodbye

522
00:38:53,694 --> 00:38:55,335
Why didn't you give me a signal
to start the attack?

523
00:38:55,456 --> 00:38:57,418
I saved your life

524
00:38:57,498 --> 00:38:58,339
Saved me?

525
00:38:58,459 --> 00:39:03,023
Yes, I think
Mo Jun Feng's daggers are back

526
00:39:03,103 --> 00:39:04,705
and are with him

527
00:39:04,825 --> 00:39:07,668
You may be no match for him

528
00:39:25,886 --> 00:39:27,968
You are a famous swordsman?

529
00:39:28,088 --> 00:39:29,450
You can put it that way

530
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,091
Please tell me how I can become

531
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:32,893
a swordsman more famous than you

532
00:39:33,013 --> 00:39:35,376
Kill more people than I have

533
00:39:35,496 --> 00:39:39,259
Wrong... if I could kill you

534
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,102
I'll be a more famous swordsman than you

535
00:39:45,065 --> 00:39:47,548
Is that the reason
why you have been waiting for me?

536
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:53,554
Alright, you are a junior...
I'll let you strike first

537
00:40:09,009 --> 00:40:10,090
Stop

538
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,452
Why?

539
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:15,616
When two heroes fight,
one will surely get hurt

540
00:40:15,696 --> 00:40:17,017
I don't want this to happen

541
00:40:17,097 --> 00:40:20,901
He's your man,
but how am I related to you?

542
00:40:21,662 --> 00:40:23,824
I want to be your friend

543
00:40:38,278 --> 00:40:40,280
Yun Xiang, go back first

544
00:41:08,949 --> 00:41:11,151
So you finally come to me!

545
00:41:11,271 --> 00:41:12,192
Who do you want me to kill?

546
00:41:12,272 --> 00:41:15,396
No killings:
Just keep a close watch on one person

547
00:41:15,476 --> 00:41:17,838
and don't let him mess things up
at the critical moment

548
00:41:17,918 --> 00:41:18,559
Who?

549
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,080
Xiao Qiang

550
00:41:20,961 --> 00:41:24,004
So clever! There were two enemies

551
00:41:24,084 --> 00:41:25,606
but all of a sudden,
there's no enemy at all

552
00:41:25,726 --> 00:41:26,847
You can get ten thousand taels of silver

553
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:30,050
It's no easy thing
to keep a close watch on Xiao Qiang

554
00:41:31,171 --> 00:41:32,773
There's a pill here

555
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:35,055
Put it into her food

556
00:41:51,832 --> 00:41:53,033
What's that you're holding?

557
00:41:53,874 --> 00:41:56,036
An iron hand you made for someone

558
00:41:56,877 --> 00:41:59,840
Qiu Zi Yu,
you wouldn't make a sword for me

559
00:42:00,361 --> 00:42:01,722
Look what this is?

560
00:42:04,044 --> 00:42:05,366
Your daggers have returned

561
00:42:05,486 --> 00:42:07,888
Qiu Zi Yu, from today onwards

562
00:42:08,008 --> 00:42:10,411
you'll make whatever I ask you

563
00:42:10,491 --> 00:42:14,054
or you'll die

564
00:42:14,134 --> 00:42:15,335
Hear that?

565
00:42:16,377 --> 00:42:17,858
No way

566
00:42:21,261 --> 00:42:24,665
Mo Jun Feng, stop trying

567
00:42:24,785 --> 00:42:27,027
or you'll end up like you did yesterday

568
00:42:34,154 --> 00:42:37,478
I have broken 3 of your daggers,
I'll return 3 to you

569
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:40,361
Qiu Zi Yu, I want to be friends with you

570
00:42:40,481 --> 00:42:41,642
Why?

571
00:42:41,762 --> 00:42:44,084
It's fearful to be your enemy

572
00:42:46,367 --> 00:42:48,649
There is no friendship which lasts forever

573
00:42:48,729 --> 00:42:51,011
and no perpetual enemy

574
00:43:01,822 --> 00:43:03,063
Please sit

575
00:43:06,347 --> 00:43:09,309
Why this impetuous use of weapons
as soon as we meet?

576
00:43:11,151 --> 00:43:12,433
Who sent you?

577
00:43:13,033 --> 00:43:14,274
I sent him here

578
00:43:24,485 --> 00:43:26,407
I sent him to see how good you are

579
00:43:26,487 --> 00:43:28,008
Have you found out?

580
00:43:28,088 --> 00:43:29,249
Yes

581
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:31,452
The Golden Lion is not in his mansion

582
00:43:31,532 --> 00:43:33,534
Why have you come here?

583
00:43:33,654 --> 00:43:35,055
He Huan Jade

584
00:43:35,776 --> 00:43:39,339
If we join hands, we could get it

585
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,581
Not a bad idea

586
00:43:40,661 --> 00:43:43,784
but how do we split it when we get it?

587
00:43:43,864 --> 00:43:44,945
It�ll be yours

588
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:49,069
together with the assets in the Lion Rock

589
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,271
What do you get then?

590
00:43:51,392 --> 00:43:52,553
You

591
00:43:54,675 --> 00:43:58,118
Someone might not agree even if I did

592
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,643
Mo Jun Feng? I'll tell you one thing

593
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,164
Be careful

594
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,854
I am not lying to you

595
00:44:13,974 --> 00:44:16,617
You'll know it once Mo Jun Feng returns

596
00:44:17,898 --> 00:44:20,621
Appearances deceive

597
00:44:21,662 --> 00:44:23,063
How should I thank you?

598
00:44:23,183 --> 00:44:26,066
I'll send someone
to take you to the Lion Rock

599
00:44:26,186 --> 00:44:28,429
Together we'll deal with those four

600
00:44:49,329 --> 00:44:51,692
Xiao Qiang, Zhen Liu Xiang is here

601
00:44:51,812 --> 00:44:54,975
2 of the 4 guests have arrived

602
00:44:55,095 --> 00:44:55,936
Really?

603
00:44:56,056 --> 00:44:57,177
I have made investigations

604
00:44:57,297 --> 00:45:00,020
Zhen Liu Xiang was with Wu Hao
as soon as she arrived

605
00:45:12,673 --> 00:45:16,236
What's this? Looks like a pill

606
00:45:18,879 --> 00:45:22,082
It's a pain killer pill

607
00:45:22,403 --> 00:45:24,925
When did you get this sickness?

608
00:45:25,045 --> 00:45:27,368
I'll get you some water to take the pill

609
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:31,532
Xiao Qiang, what are you doing?

610
00:45:33,293 --> 00:45:37,217
Your ex-sweetheart has found you
the daggers, no wonder

611
00:45:37,337 --> 00:45:38,178
"Feng Chi vital point"

612
00:45:40,901 --> 00:45:42,142
"Lion Rock"

613
00:45:53,914 --> 00:45:55,155
Jin Ba

614
00:45:55,275 --> 00:45:56,877
You have arrived in time

615
00:45:56,997 --> 00:45:59,880
Since I've got the jade,
even you'd suspect me

616
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,243
if I were a little late

617
00:46:06,647 --> 00:46:08,088
Brother Jin, brother Cheng...
long time no see!

618
00:46:08,168 --> 00:46:09,129
Indeed, please

619
00:46:09,249 --> 00:46:10,531
Please...

620
00:46:27,828 --> 00:46:30,631
Brother Jin, I have to tell you that

621
00:46:30,711 --> 00:46:33,193
Wu and Zhen Liu Xiang arrived pretty early

622
00:46:33,313 --> 00:46:35,996
They might be up to something

623
00:46:37,277 --> 00:46:40,000
They wouldn't dare

624
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,082
It's hard to say

625
00:46:42,202 --> 00:46:43,484
Please

626
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:52,653
We're late

627
00:46:52,733 --> 00:46:53,694
Please sit

628
00:47:13,233 --> 00:47:15,356
Please rest in the guest rooms

629
00:47:15,476 --> 00:47:18,599
When the feast is ready we'll call you

630
00:47:18,679 --> 00:47:20,481
Okay...

631
00:47:20,601 --> 00:47:21,482
Shuang Shuang

632
00:47:23,123 --> 00:47:25,726
Golden Lion, it's so nice of you

633
00:47:25,846 --> 00:47:27,608
to get Shuang Shuang to wait on us

634
00:47:27,688 --> 00:47:28,649
Please

635
00:47:28,729 --> 00:47:30,050
Please...

636
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,617
You might think Jin Ba is arrogant

637
00:47:36,697 --> 00:47:38,499
I think he wants it all for himself

638
00:47:39,259 --> 00:47:42,583
We both might as well...

639
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:51,352
Mo Jun Feng

640
00:47:54,314 --> 00:47:55,275
"Feng Chi vital point"

641
00:47:57,998 --> 00:47:59,079
"Er Mun vital point"

642
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:12,373
I don't know what to say

643
00:48:12,893 --> 00:48:14,975
You know what I want to say?

644
00:48:15,095 --> 00:48:17,498
I'll listen to anything you say

645
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:19,660
Woman is the source of all trouble

646
00:48:21,902 --> 00:48:23,384
Xiao Qiang's smile

647
00:48:23,464 --> 00:48:26,347
is deadlier than my daggers

648
00:48:28,949 --> 00:48:29,630
What time is it?

649
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,151
It's 5pm

650
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:32,833
All the 4 guests are here?

651
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:35,956
They and their men
were riding across the town

652
00:48:36,076 --> 00:48:38,559
The sound of the horse hooves
was like thunder

653
00:48:40,761 --> 00:48:42,603
It's a pity I lost my daggers

654
00:48:42,683 --> 00:48:44,725
that means I have no chance

655
00:48:44,845 --> 00:48:46,447
There are still 3 daggers

656
00:48:52,693 --> 00:48:55,936
Good, even better than the ones I had

657
00:48:56,056 --> 00:48:57,337
You are the best swordsmith

658
00:48:57,458 --> 00:48:59,900
This is my compensation,
I have other business

659
00:49:16,196 --> 00:49:18,399
The iron hand is ready

660
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,683
It has five uses

661
00:49:22,763 --> 00:49:25,766
It could be a fist, a claw,
for attacking a foe

662
00:49:25,886 --> 00:49:27,648
and seizing opponents' weapons

663
00:49:27,768 --> 00:49:32,132
It can ensnare secret darts
and shoot 4 daggers

664
00:49:32,252 --> 00:49:35,816
I really don't know how to thank you

665
00:49:35,896 --> 00:49:38,619
You must promise me one thing

666
00:49:38,699 --> 00:49:40,100
before I give you the hand

667
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,262
I'll do whatever you say

668
00:49:42,383 --> 00:49:44,465
I'll fix-up the hand for you

669
00:49:44,585 --> 00:49:46,347
you must do a few things for me

670
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:48,429
I will teach you how to use

671
00:49:48,509 --> 00:49:51,392
the 5 functions of the hand

672
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:55,716
What you must do for me
might be very dangerous

673
00:49:55,836 --> 00:50:00,401
We'll be unwelcome guests
at a certain place

674
00:50:03,123 --> 00:50:04,565
I'll go to make preparations

675
00:50:10,491 --> 00:50:12,493
The welcome dinner is almost over

676
00:50:13,053 --> 00:50:16,016
I can't take care of you anymore,
you'll be on your own

677
00:50:16,657 --> 00:50:17,658
Take care

678
00:50:17,778 --> 00:50:18,859
Thanks

679
00:50:32,593 --> 00:50:36,036
Truly someone trained by
Peng Shuang Shuang

680
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,678
What's your name?

681
00:50:37,798 --> 00:50:39,360
Xiao Hong

682
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,122
Xiao Hong is Shuang Shuang's best hand

683
00:50:42,242 --> 00:50:43,644
When the game starts

684
00:50:43,724 --> 00:50:45,526
she'll serve us alone

685
00:50:45,646 --> 00:50:48,649
She'll have to serve one man
after the game

686
00:50:48,769 --> 00:50:49,530
Who?

687
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:50,851
Brother Jin

688
00:50:51,211 --> 00:50:53,293
He likes fresh beauty

689
00:50:53,414 --> 00:50:56,977
Check out how fresh Xiao Hong is

690
00:51:05,906 --> 00:51:07,908
Gentlemen, the game is about to begin

691
00:51:08,028 --> 00:51:09,990
I'll make preparations

692
00:51:23,564 --> 00:51:28,048
My task is accomplished

693
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:31,932
and your guests have been well entertained

694
00:51:32,052 --> 00:51:34,455
May I go now?

695
00:51:34,535 --> 00:51:35,456
Yes

696
00:51:38,298 --> 00:51:40,340
Here's this something extra for you

697
00:51:42,022 --> 00:51:43,103
Thanks

698
00:51:53,073 --> 00:51:54,435
You know what to do?

699
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:11,652
Why didn't you kill me?

700
00:52:14,334 --> 00:52:18,298
It's not me, she saved you

701
00:52:18,379 --> 00:52:23,424
otherwise it would be a sword,
not a red flower

702
00:52:53,814 --> 00:52:55,456
Please check

703
00:52:55,536 --> 00:52:58,098
If we didn't trust you

704
00:52:58,218 --> 00:53:00,981
we wouldn't have asked you
to be the banker

705
00:53:01,061 --> 00:53:04,785
What are the rules for winning?

706
00:53:04,865 --> 00:53:06,907
Didn't we agree on the betting?

707
00:53:07,027 --> 00:53:08,429
There are 4 choices

708
00:53:08,509 --> 00:53:10,831
Whoever bets correctly
will get the He Huan Jade

709
00:53:22,082 --> 00:53:27,608
Let's see the jade first

710
00:53:31,852 --> 00:53:34,214
Right... come, men

711
00:53:53,554 --> 00:53:55,436
The Golden Hammer
which gave brother Jin his fame

712
00:53:55,516 --> 00:54:00,320
It's real deadly

713
00:54:02,883 --> 00:54:05,726
We'll gamble here, you guard outside

714
00:54:05,846 --> 00:54:08,809
Nobody gets in on pain of death

715
00:54:08,929 --> 00:54:09,930
Yes

716
00:54:51,692 --> 00:54:54,495
I'll bet on...

717
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:00,821
White Tiger

718
00:55:05,265 --> 00:55:06,186
Green Dragon

719
00:55:13,754 --> 00:55:15,035
Zhu Mun

720
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,842
I never use weapons

721
00:55:22,122 --> 00:55:24,084
Then I can only bet on "Gui Sun"

722
00:55:29,249 --> 00:55:31,492
Xiao Wu, you are an expert in kung fu

723
00:55:31,612 --> 00:55:34,294
Your fists are your weapons

724
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:37,858
The poison in Miss Liu Xiang's hairpin
is deadly

725
00:55:37,978 --> 00:55:39,980
There's no antidote for that

726
00:55:40,381 --> 00:55:44,024
How could we stupid fellows
be any match for it?

727
00:55:53,073 --> 00:55:54,034
Open

728
00:55:57,478 --> 00:56:00,721
There's a fierce tiger at Mt. West,
body white as snow

729
00:56:00,841 --> 00:56:02,002
White Tiger wins

730
00:56:02,082 --> 00:56:03,163
I've won

731
00:56:23,664 --> 00:56:25,826
Xiao Cheng, why?

732
00:56:26,827 --> 00:56:29,189
Jin Ba nurtured bad intentions

733
00:56:31,071 --> 00:56:33,994
Really?
He has had the He Huan Jade all the time

734
00:56:34,074 --> 00:56:36,357
If he wanted it for himself,
he wouldn't have come here

735
00:56:36,477 --> 00:56:39,640
With the 3 of us alive,
he can't get it safely

736
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,483
The eight heroes he brought are outside

737
00:56:42,603 --> 00:56:45,366
ready to kill us all

738
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:47,648
Where are the eight men?

739
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,061
Pack up the bodies

740
00:57:01,141 --> 00:57:02,062
Yes

741
00:57:17,678 --> 00:57:20,361
What should we do with this jade?

742
00:57:20,481 --> 00:57:21,642
We bet for it again

743
00:57:22,282 --> 00:57:24,765
We would have to trouble you again

744
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:31,051
I still bet on Green Dragon

745
00:57:32,252 --> 00:57:35,055
Wu Hao and I maintain our original choice

746
00:57:35,456 --> 00:57:37,418
There's something I'd like to ask

747
00:57:37,538 --> 00:57:40,421
If the one who comes out is
"Zhu Mun" or "Gui Sun"

748
00:57:40,501 --> 00:57:43,424
Would we end up like Jin Ba?

749
00:57:43,504 --> 00:57:46,026
You and Xiao Wu must join hands to fight

750
00:57:46,146 --> 00:57:47,828
Would I do such a foolish thing?

751
00:57:47,908 --> 00:57:49,830
I'm afraid if the outcome is Green Dragon

752
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:52,593
you both would join up against me

753
00:57:52,673 --> 00:57:55,596
Against Jin Ba
when you teamed up with Golden Lion

754
00:57:55,676 --> 00:57:57,798
it seemed you had an understanding

755
00:57:57,878 --> 00:57:59,880
Then it's two against two

756
00:58:00,641 --> 00:58:03,444
As long as
you honour the result of the game

757
00:58:03,524 --> 00:58:04,845
I'll be neutral

758
00:58:04,965 --> 00:58:07,207
Alright then

759
00:58:18,298 --> 00:58:21,662
There's a fierce tiger at Mt. West,
body white as snow

760
00:58:21,782 --> 00:58:23,263
White Tiger wins

761
00:58:24,945 --> 00:58:26,667
Mao Kai Yuan,
how come it's White Tiger again?

762
00:58:26,787 --> 00:58:28,188
This is called "Lo Bao"

763
00:58:28,268 --> 00:58:30,391
When I ran a casino in Guangdong

764
00:58:30,471 --> 00:58:31,632
There was a banker who

765
00:58:31,712 --> 00:58:34,435
opened "Lo Bao" straight through
for 37 times

766
00:58:34,515 --> 00:58:36,316
None of us won

767
00:58:36,437 --> 00:58:38,759
So please try again

768
00:58:38,879 --> 00:58:41,081
Not necessary

769
00:58:41,201 --> 00:58:43,524
None of you would win

770
00:58:43,644 --> 00:58:47,247
You don't have the luck: Just accept that

771
00:58:47,368 --> 00:58:49,650
What do you mean? We had an agreement

772
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:51,211
What agreement?

773
00:58:51,291 --> 00:58:54,695
I said to follow the result of the game

774
00:58:55,736 --> 00:58:59,500
Why are you so slow this time?

775
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,061
Golden Lion is only using you

776
00:59:01,141 --> 00:59:02,823
to get rid of the strong Jin Ba

777
00:59:02,903 --> 00:59:05,386
He's bent on getting this piece of jade

778
00:59:07,187 --> 00:59:11,632
You won't be able to
take it out of the Lion Rock

779
00:59:11,712 --> 00:59:14,675
I will present you three with a favour

780
00:59:14,795 --> 00:59:17,438
so you'll leave safely

781
00:59:17,558 --> 00:59:20,320
Consider it, I am leaving

782
00:59:21,081 --> 00:59:24,324
Xiao Hong, tea for our guests

783
00:59:24,445 --> 00:59:25,446
Yes

784
01:00:06,727 --> 01:00:10,010
The Golden Lion's Fist and Cheng's Shield

785
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:13,734
are strong kung fu, we are leaving

786
01:00:15,736 --> 01:00:17,418
Did you forget
I still have my 6 men outside?

787
01:00:17,498 --> 01:00:21,221
I haven't...
Jin Ba has 8 heroes, you have 6:

788
01:00:21,301 --> 01:00:22,783
How could I forget?

789
01:00:57,458 --> 01:01:01,301
Zhen Liu Xiang is really a great beauty

790
01:01:01,702 --> 01:01:04,144
Please put down whatever's in your hands

791
01:01:04,264 --> 01:01:09,510
Money comes and goes

792
01:01:10,951 --> 01:01:12,553
I admit defeat

793
01:01:18,479 --> 01:01:20,240
Xiao Wu, stop Mao Kai Yuan

794
01:01:31,932 --> 01:01:35,055
I hear Xiao Qiang's smile is famous

795
01:01:35,135 --> 01:01:37,778
can you smile now?

796
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:52,352
Kill them all, no one leaves here alive

797
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:12,052
Mo Jun Feng, I return the daggers to you

798
01:02:12,172 --> 01:02:15,456
as you have avenged me
by killing Zhen Liu Xiang

799
01:02:51,452 --> 01:02:54,134
Mo Jun Feng, the way you draw your daggers

800
01:02:54,254 --> 01:02:55,736
will make you slower than me

801
01:02:55,856 --> 01:02:58,058
I still have one dagger

802
01:02:58,899 --> 01:03:04,104
Unless you are sure
you could kill me immediately

803
01:03:04,224 --> 01:03:07,708
I still could kill you
even if you wound me

804
01:03:07,828 --> 01:03:10,631
as I have 6 daggers

805
01:03:12,072 --> 01:03:13,834
We are experts with daggers

806
01:03:13,914 --> 01:03:17,638
there is no guarantee
one strike would kill

807
01:03:17,758 --> 01:03:19,079
What do you want?

808
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:22,002
Mao Kai Yuan raised me for 10 years

809
01:03:22,082 --> 01:03:24,365
Although I have repaid him

810
01:03:24,485 --> 01:03:27,007
I still need to protect him one last time

811
01:03:27,368 --> 01:03:28,889
Go now

812
01:03:29,009 --> 01:03:31,892
After today I'll look you up for a duel

813
01:03:32,012 --> 01:03:32,813
and see who wins

814
01:03:32,893 --> 01:03:34,535
That's a deal

815
01:03:36,056 --> 01:03:38,018
Better go & find Mo Jun Feng to
avenge Zhen Liu Xiang

816
01:03:38,138 --> 01:03:39,460
Why are you still pestering me?

817
01:03:45,706 --> 01:03:47,147
Xiao Hong

818
01:03:54,234 --> 01:03:56,236
Mao Kai Yuan, you can go first

819
01:03:56,356 --> 01:03:57,998
I'll watch these two for you

820
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:00,481
Yun Xiang,
ask him to leave the He Huan Jade

821
01:04:00,601 --> 01:04:02,803
Mao Kai Yuan, put down the He Huan Jade

822
01:04:03,404 --> 01:04:04,405
Why?

823
01:04:04,525 --> 01:04:08,008
Xiao Hong wants it,
so you have to give her

824
01:04:14,495 --> 01:04:18,419
Xiao Hong, I know that
Mao Kai Yuan is not a good man

825
01:04:18,539 --> 01:04:21,782
but I can't get to kill him myself

826
01:04:24,304 --> 01:04:26,306
I don't think this is necessary

827
01:05:01,782 --> 01:05:02,943
I practise the Iron Clothing kung fu
and hence

828
01:05:03,063 --> 01:05:05,666
the only one in the world
who doesn't fear your dagger

829
01:05:21,802 --> 01:05:25,125
Wu Hao, your Iron Clothing kung fu

830
01:05:25,245 --> 01:05:28,008
can protect you from daggers thrown by man

831
01:05:28,088 --> 01:05:31,612
But not those shot by machine

832
01:05:31,692 --> 01:05:34,655
You wouldn't have died if

833
01:05:34,735 --> 01:05:36,897
you were not greedy for the He Huan Jade

834
01:05:42,863 --> 01:05:45,145
Yan Zi Fei, you're too quick in killing

835
01:05:45,265 --> 01:05:49,390
You said that
whoever got the Jade would be killed

836
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:52,232
You want to kill me this way too

837
01:05:54,154 --> 01:05:56,196
Yun Xiang, this Brother Qiu

838
01:05:56,316 --> 01:05:58,278
is the only good man here

839
01:06:05,165 --> 01:06:08,609
Xiao Hong,
don't let your friend get involved

840
01:06:08,689 --> 01:06:12,453
I want to bet with the Golden Lion

841
01:06:16,296 --> 01:06:17,458
On what?

842
01:06:17,578 --> 01:06:19,620
On He Huan Jade... with our lives

843
01:07:06,066 --> 01:07:08,509
Brother Qiu, thanks for your three daggers

844
01:07:08,629 --> 01:07:11,432
Oh, no problem.
My pleasure if you can use my daggers

845
01:07:11,512 --> 01:07:14,915
to get rid of the bad elements
in the martial world

846
01:07:24,565 --> 01:07:27,848
"Life
earth"

847
01:07:31,412 --> 01:07:33,253
You really want to gamble with me

848
01:07:33,694 --> 01:07:35,175
You'll surely lose

849
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:37,217
Who doesn't know
that I am the gambling king

850
01:07:37,297 --> 01:07:39,059
Look carefully

851
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:42,423
This iron plaque has two sides

852
01:07:42,503 --> 01:07:45,746
Let me put it into the box, you open it

853
01:07:45,866 --> 01:07:51,912
If the word "die" faces you, you die:
Or else you live

854
01:07:52,032 --> 01:07:53,994
You are called the gambling king

855
01:07:54,074 --> 01:07:58,038
I think there must be some trickery
in this box

856
01:07:58,158 --> 01:08:00,841
You can control the result

857
01:08:00,921 --> 01:08:03,203
Qiu Zi Yu, will you keep your word?

858
01:08:03,283 --> 01:08:05,646
If I don't

859
01:08:08,529 --> 01:08:11,772
there're witnesses here:
Well, do you want to bet?

860
01:08:15,376 --> 01:08:17,658
I'll win for sure, why not?

861
01:08:37,357 --> 01:08:41,722
You'd still bet
despite being aware of the trickery?

862
01:08:41,842 --> 01:08:43,404
Don't blame me then

863
01:08:52,733 --> 01:08:56,296
Gambling King, why don't you open the box?

864
01:09:15,035 --> 01:09:16,316
He lost

865
01:09:17,798 --> 01:09:21,402
This box has tricks, he could control it

866
01:09:21,482 --> 01:09:22,483
How did you win?

867
01:09:22,603 --> 01:09:24,204
It's too simple

868
01:09:25,446 --> 01:09:29,089
The side with the word "live"
has a small nail on it

869
01:09:29,209 --> 01:09:31,372
Nail it and
he wouldn't be able to turn it over

870
01:09:31,492 --> 01:09:33,093
This Jade...

871
01:09:38,779 --> 01:09:41,341
It will be returned to Master Nan,
its owner

872
01:09:41,462 --> 01:09:42,703
But if you like

873
01:09:42,823 --> 01:09:45,586
it can also be given to Xiao Hong

874
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:51,311
Don't touch the He Huan Jade

875
01:09:52,993 --> 01:09:54,675
You made the iron hand

876
01:09:54,795 --> 01:09:56,477
you ought to know that
you can never hide away from

877
01:09:56,597 --> 01:09:58,198
the daggers shooting out
from this iron hand

878
01:09:58,278 --> 01:10:02,362
Yes, I can't... indeed no one can

879
01:10:02,483 --> 01:10:03,844
Good that you understand

880
01:10:03,964 --> 01:10:06,807
Can you just take the He Huan Jade
with this iron hand?

881
01:10:06,887 --> 01:10:10,371
Not only will I take away the Jade,
I will kill you too

882
01:10:10,491 --> 01:10:12,172
Yan Zi Fei, you want to kill me again

883
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:15,456
with the weapons I made for you?

884
01:10:15,576 --> 01:10:18,939
Qiu Zi Yu,
blame your own good craftsmanship

885
01:10:19,059 --> 01:10:22,583
With this iron hand, I can be invincible

886
01:10:22,663 --> 01:10:24,545
But if you live,

887
01:10:24,665 --> 01:10:27,428
you may make even better weapons

888
01:10:27,548 --> 01:10:29,309
Then it will be the end of me

889
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:31,472
This iron hand has five functions

890
01:10:31,592 --> 01:10:33,193
I've only told you four

891
01:10:33,273 --> 01:10:36,557
If you kill me now,
wouldn't you regret it?

892
01:10:36,677 --> 01:10:39,880
I'm not greedy, I'm satisfied with four

893
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,763
I could already dominate
the martial arts world

894
01:10:53,894 --> 01:10:56,577
It's no use: Catching flying daggers

895
01:10:56,697 --> 01:10:59,700
is one of the 4 uses of this iron hand

896
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:04,585
No one can fight with me
for the Jade again

897
01:11:10,831 --> 01:11:12,713
This is my last dagger

898
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:15,396
No one has stayed alive
after a glimpse of this!

899
01:11:16,276 --> 01:11:19,720
I've still got two daggers in my iron hand

900
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:24,044
Before I die,
I can still kill you and Qiu Zi Yu

901
01:11:27,448 --> 01:11:30,090
This is the mystery of its fifth use

902
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:32,012
After shooting two daggers

903
01:11:32,092 --> 01:11:34,174
you have to turn a switch

904
01:11:34,294 --> 01:11:36,977
If not... the remaining two

905
01:11:37,097 --> 01:11:39,460
will be shot backwards!

906
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:46,867
Mo Jun Feng,
I never thought that you'd save me

907
01:11:46,987 --> 01:11:49,790
You saved me once,
you don't need me to save you

908
01:11:49,870 --> 01:11:51,872
I just won't let him take away
the He Huan Jade

909
01:11:51,952 --> 01:11:53,594
No matter what,

910
01:11:53,674 --> 01:11:56,797
you've thrown the last dagger for me

911
01:11:56,877 --> 01:12:00,401
which means you've given up the chance
to get the Jade

912
01:12:00,481 --> 01:12:02,122
I must thank you

913
01:12:03,203 --> 01:12:04,405
Wait

914
01:12:06,086 --> 01:12:08,969
Wait until Xiao Hong and we
take the He Huan Jade

915
01:12:09,089 --> 01:12:10,651
and get your daggers back

916
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:37,037
You didn't ask me
why I want the He Huan Jade?

917
01:12:37,838 --> 01:12:40,040
I'll give you anything you want

918
01:12:47,207 --> 01:12:49,490
Miss Xiao Hong, sorry about this

919
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:53,654
I must take Xiao Hong
and the Jade away together

920
01:12:53,774 --> 01:12:57,658
Whoever makes a move, I'll kill her first

921
01:12:58,178 --> 01:13:01,261
Shuang Shuang,
do I have a share in the Jade?

922
01:13:01,382 --> 01:13:04,825
No, I've already
helped you find the daggers

923
01:13:04,905 --> 01:13:06,066
You should be satisfied

924
01:13:06,186 --> 01:13:07,227
Where are you taking Xiao Hong?

925
01:13:07,347 --> 01:13:08,949
So long as you don't come after me,

926
01:13:09,069 --> 01:13:11,151
I'll leave her at the Fu Lai Inn

927
01:13:11,271 --> 01:13:12,993
You won't harm her?

928
01:13:13,073 --> 01:13:14,875
All I want is the He Huan Jade

929
01:13:14,995 --> 01:13:16,757
Why should I harm her?

930
01:13:16,877 --> 01:13:18,799
Not to mention I like her

931
01:13:18,879 --> 01:13:22,723
I wouldn't want to
make enemies with Xiao Zi Jing

932
01:13:27,728 --> 01:13:30,411
Shuang Shuang, you can use Xiao Hong

933
01:13:30,491 --> 01:13:34,214
to threaten Qiu Zi Yu and Yun Xiang,
but not me

934
01:13:34,294 --> 01:13:37,217
Xiao Hong's life and death
has nothing to do with me

935
01:13:37,297 --> 01:13:38,499
Put down the He Huan Jade

936
01:13:38,619 --> 01:13:40,220
Do you want to bet with me

937
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:43,023
and see if I would kill her?

938
01:13:43,664 --> 01:13:45,826
Mo Jun Feng, let her go

939
01:13:45,946 --> 01:13:47,708
I'd rather not put Xiao Hong at any risk

940
01:13:49,229 --> 01:13:52,633
I suppose we can't avoid a combat today

941
01:13:53,033 --> 01:13:54,595
All you have in your hand is a dagger

942
01:13:54,675 --> 01:13:58,599
You can't beat me, let her go

943
01:13:58,679 --> 01:14:00,000
I'll let you take back all the daggers

944
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,361
and fight

945
01:14:01,482 --> 01:14:03,444
Yun Xiang, I'm leaving

946
01:14:03,524 --> 01:14:06,046
Head for the Fu Lai Inn and meet Xiao Hong

947
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:13,654
Get back your daggers:
Brother Qiu will be the witness

948
01:14:13,734 --> 01:14:15,976
I won't take advantage of you

949
01:14:32,433 --> 01:14:35,676
Maybe I've already taken advantage of you

950
01:14:35,796 --> 01:14:37,838
I've already seen
the secret of your last dagger

951
01:14:39,119 --> 01:14:41,121
I'll let you take this bit of advantage

952
01:14:41,241 --> 01:14:44,204
I believe that even if you have seen it

953
01:14:44,324 --> 01:14:46,006
you still won't be able to duck & avoid it

954
01:14:51,211 --> 01:14:53,894
We'll see

955
01:15:00,821 --> 01:15:02,383
Get ready

956
01:15:02,463 --> 01:15:05,586
I'll throw a dice
and that will be the signal

957
01:16:02,082 --> 01:16:07,327
So you too have your last dagger

958
01:16:08,529 --> 01:16:12,573
These two daggers are made of magnet

959
01:16:12,933 --> 01:16:15,215
attracting metals

960
01:16:28,188 --> 01:16:31,552
Because I've seen his last dagger

961
01:16:31,672 --> 01:16:33,153
I had that edge over him

962
01:16:33,273 --> 01:16:37,998
He was a hero after all

963
01:16:39,079 --> 01:16:40,441
You know Xiao Hong too?

964
01:16:41,482 --> 01:16:44,124
I've known her for a long time

965
01:16:44,244 --> 01:16:46,206
She's like a sister to me

966
01:16:46,326 --> 01:16:49,650
Why did Peng Shuang Shuang
mention Xiao Zi Jing?

967
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:52,092
She's the daughter of Xiao Zi Jing

968
01:16:52,212 --> 01:16:55,616
She and her father
are trying to get the Jade back

969
01:16:55,696 --> 01:16:58,939
That's why I said it would be the same

970
01:16:59,059 --> 01:16:59,860
if I gave the He Huan Jade to her

971
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:03,343
But she told me she was an orphan

972
01:17:03,464 --> 01:17:04,344
Why did she lie to me?

973
01:17:04,465 --> 01:17:06,346
She sneaked into the Lion Rock alone

974
01:17:06,467 --> 01:17:08,268
naturally she couldn't tell the truth

975
01:17:08,389 --> 01:17:11,472
Would she tell me the truth in the future?

976
01:17:14,955 --> 01:17:18,439
I believe she would

977
01:17:19,119 --> 01:17:21,001
Hurry and go to the Fu Lai Inn to get her

978
01:17:21,081 --> 01:17:22,082
I must think of a way

979
01:17:22,202 --> 01:17:24,805
to get back the Jade from
Peng Shuang Shuang

980
01:18:04,485 --> 01:18:08,128
Peng Shuang Shuang,
I've been waiting for you

981
01:18:11,211 --> 01:18:13,974
Peng Shuang Shuang, you have no way out

982
01:18:14,094 --> 01:18:16,016
You'd better come in and talk

983
01:18:28,268 --> 01:18:31,071
This is Yun Xiang, this is my dad

984
01:18:31,392 --> 01:18:32,913
He is...

985
01:18:33,033 --> 01:18:33,954
Brother Qiu has told me already

986
01:18:34,074 --> 01:18:36,757
You wouldn't blame me for

987
01:18:36,877 --> 01:18:38,078
not speaking the truth
at the Lion Rock, would you?

988
01:18:38,198 --> 01:18:40,160
You and your father are together now

989
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,483
Peng Shuang Shuang is in your hands

990
01:18:42,603 --> 01:18:45,886
He Huan Jade is with her, I can go now

991
01:18:46,407 --> 01:18:48,529
Yun Xiang, don't go

992
01:18:50,891 --> 01:18:52,052
You want me to stay?

993
01:18:53,293 --> 01:18:55,215
You still haven't answered my question

994
01:18:55,295 --> 01:18:56,777
Would you blame me?

995
01:18:57,097 --> 01:18:58,178
I wouldn't

996
01:19:04,264 --> 01:19:07,628
Peng Shuang Shuang,
hand over the He Huan Jade

997
01:19:11,712 --> 01:19:13,113
The He Huan Jade is gone

998
01:19:13,233 --> 01:19:14,715
Xiao Hong, she has no chance

999
01:19:14,835 --> 01:19:16,837
to hide the He Huan Jade in the house

1000
01:19:16,957 --> 01:19:18,919
Take her behind the screen and search her

1001
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,120
Yes

1002
01:19:33,654 --> 01:19:36,417
This is hot stuff

1003
01:19:38,539 --> 01:19:40,100
My name is Qiu Zi Yu

1004
01:19:41,261 --> 01:19:44,264
Probably you've heard about me

1005
01:19:44,785 --> 01:19:46,026
Because of the He Huan Jade

1006
01:19:46,146 --> 01:19:48,629
over ten people died

1007
01:19:48,709 --> 01:19:52,953
You've got it but
you have no ability to keep it

1008
01:19:53,073 --> 01:19:57,037
This thing will bring disaster to you

1009
01:19:57,398 --> 01:19:58,879
Since you know me

1010
01:19:58,999 --> 01:20:01,722
you'll of course know that
you cannot resist

1011
01:20:01,842 --> 01:20:04,044
if I have to take it by force

1012
01:20:04,124 --> 01:20:07,448
I don't want this thing

1013
01:20:07,568 --> 01:20:10,250
I just want to return it
to its original owner

1014
01:20:10,330 --> 01:20:12,012
This belongs to the Nan family:

1015
01:20:12,092 --> 01:20:14,815
It's the private property of Master Nan

1016
01:20:14,895 --> 01:20:17,057
I have to take it to Dong Gang

1017
01:20:28,869 --> 01:20:30,230
She doesn't have it on her

1018
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:32,513
No?

1019
01:20:37,678 --> 01:20:40,801
Did you meet anyone while coming here?

1020
01:20:40,921 --> 01:20:42,042
No

1021
01:20:44,284 --> 01:20:45,726
Except just now on the way up the stairs

1022
01:20:45,846 --> 01:20:47,728
someone passed by very quickly

1023
01:20:47,848 --> 01:20:49,209
Who's this person?

1024
01:20:49,289 --> 01:20:52,733
Skinny, like an old man

1025
01:20:56,777 --> 01:20:58,899
I know where the He Huan Jade is

1026
01:21:14,274 --> 01:21:15,396
Cui the thief

1027
01:21:15,756 --> 01:21:16,797
Constable Xiao

1028
01:21:16,917 --> 01:21:19,400
Hand over the He Huan Jade,
this is stolen goods

1029
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:21,001
Old Xiao, you know everything

1030
01:21:21,081 --> 01:21:23,163
Nothing could be hidden from you

1031
01:21:23,283 --> 01:21:24,244
Hand it over

1032
01:21:24,364 --> 01:21:26,246
The He Huan Jade was in my hands
a while back

1033
01:21:26,366 --> 01:21:28,288
but I've given it to Qiu Zi Yu

1034
01:21:28,409 --> 01:21:31,091
He said he'd go to Dong Gang
and give it to Master Nan

1035
01:21:31,211 --> 01:21:34,935
Then go and catch up with Qiu Zi Yu,
tell him I'm here

1036
01:21:35,055 --> 01:21:38,178
ask him to give me the Jade
to close the case

1037
01:21:38,298 --> 01:21:40,781
That is,
even if it has been given to Master Nan

1038
01:21:40,901 --> 01:21:43,544
As the owner has reported loss,
procedurally

1039
01:21:43,664 --> 01:21:47,508
he must first drop the case
and then request its return

1040
01:21:47,628 --> 01:21:49,269
Yes, I'll go

1041
01:21:53,073 --> 01:21:54,475
You aren't afraid
I could have lied to you?

1042
01:21:55,876 --> 01:21:58,999
I can tell the truth from deceit, now go

1043
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:00,040
Yes

1044
01:22:06,847 --> 01:22:11,051
Yun Xiang, I know things about you

1045
01:22:11,171 --> 01:22:13,494
If young men like you could
turn over a leaf

1046
01:22:13,614 --> 01:22:16,617
you'll surely have a bright future

1047
01:22:16,737 --> 01:22:19,460
I could observe your relationship
with my daughter

1048
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:22,222
Let us talk about this

1049
01:22:22,302 --> 01:22:23,223
Yes, uncle

1050
01:22:23,303 --> 01:22:24,385
Come

1051
01:22:33,674 --> 01:22:34,835
Peng Shuang Shuang

1052
01:22:57,458 --> 01:22:59,980
No need to chase

1053
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:02,863
it's someone unimportant

1054
01:23:03,624 --> 01:23:07,107
He was sent earlier

1055
01:23:07,227 --> 01:23:09,109
This man still thought that

1056
01:23:09,229 --> 01:23:11,832
Peng Shuang Shuang has got
the He Huan Jade

1057
01:23:11,952 --> 01:23:15,996
So he sent someone
to kill Shuang Shuang to get it back

1058
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:18,399
If I am correct

1059
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:19,760
the He Huan Jade

1060
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,802
is already in the hands of this man

1061
01:23:21,882 --> 01:23:23,283
Who's this person?

1062
01:23:23,404 --> 01:23:27,327
I'm just speculating, I'm not sure

1063
01:23:27,448 --> 01:23:30,210
if it's really the person I have in mind

1064
01:23:30,290 --> 01:23:32,092
He's not only great in kung fu

1065
01:23:32,212 --> 01:23:34,294
he has lots of followers

1066
01:23:34,415 --> 01:23:36,176
You and Xiao Hong stay here

1067
01:23:36,296 --> 01:23:38,058
I'll send more soldiers over

1068
01:23:41,942 --> 01:23:44,825
In event of emergency,
take the cue & act accordingly

1069
01:23:44,945 --> 01:23:47,708
Even if I can't find you here

1070
01:23:47,828 --> 01:23:50,110
I'll meet you at Dong Gang

1071
01:24:07,968 --> 01:24:10,330
We must tackle this person
with great caution

1072
01:24:10,451 --> 01:24:12,212
as he's an expert in weaponry

1073
01:24:12,292 --> 01:24:16,256
His previous rule in making weapons was

1074
01:24:16,376 --> 01:24:18,859
to exchange his product
for a kung fu technique

1075
01:24:18,979 --> 01:24:21,422
Therefore his kung fu is

1076
01:24:21,502 --> 01:24:23,223
broad and profound

1077
01:24:23,343 --> 01:24:25,586
I know he forged a pair of

1078
01:24:25,666 --> 01:24:27,948
pressure points golden pens for Mr Xi Dai

1079
01:24:28,068 --> 01:24:29,910
in exchange for pressure-points kung fu

1080
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:33,394
and made 12 lancet daggers
for Lin Him, the Phantom

1081
01:24:33,474 --> 01:24:35,796
in exchange for the Phantom Steps

1082
01:24:35,876 --> 01:24:39,480
He made a silver whip
for the Whip King, Pu Kung

1083
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:40,761
and a double headed staff

1084
01:24:40,881 --> 01:24:44,405
for the Staff Master Zhao Kun

1085
01:24:44,525 --> 01:24:46,687
So he must have learned techniques
from these two

1086
01:24:46,807 --> 01:24:48,449
He made a lot of weapons

1087
01:24:48,529 --> 01:24:50,330
so his knowledge of kung fu is boundless

1088
01:24:50,451 --> 01:24:52,733
Everyone has to be very careful

1089
01:24:52,853 --> 01:24:56,537
and ruthless, show no mercy

1090
01:24:56,657 --> 01:24:59,700
Don't give him any chance to fight back.
Dead or alive

1091
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:02,022
don't let him escape

1092
01:25:04,945 --> 01:25:07,628
Who's this person that dad is suspecting?

1093
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:11,191
I think I know him

1094
01:25:11,271 --> 01:25:12,352
Who is it?

1095
01:25:14,314 --> 01:25:15,756
I think there's something wrong

1096
01:25:15,876 --> 01:25:16,637
What is it?

1097
01:25:16,717 --> 01:25:19,440
I went after Qiu Zi Yu, but overtook him

1098
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,161
and arrived at Dong Gang
earlier than he did

1099
01:25:21,281 --> 01:25:25,045
I found something weird
and so I hid myself

1100
01:25:30,050 --> 01:25:34,054
Thanks,
you've really come to Dong Gang for me

1101
01:25:34,174 --> 01:25:34,935
You're really trustworthy

1102
01:25:35,055 --> 01:25:36,457
Glad that I didn't fail the mission

1103
01:25:46,387 --> 01:25:47,468
Thank you

1104
01:25:47,588 --> 01:25:50,030
No need, I've done a good thing

1105
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:52,673
I am at peace and happy

1106
01:25:52,793 --> 01:25:56,837
Master Nan, the property now
with its owner, I'll leave

1107
01:25:56,957 --> 01:25:59,480
Brother Qiu, see you

1108
01:26:01,802 --> 01:26:04,405
Think about it,
if this is something just and open

1109
01:26:04,485 --> 01:26:05,646
Why do those men need to put on masks?

1110
01:26:05,766 --> 01:26:08,328
What colour clothing were they wearing?

1111
01:26:08,449 --> 01:26:09,770
Grey

1112
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:11,812
Then my guess is right

1113
01:26:11,892 --> 01:26:15,255
The ones who killed
Peng Shuang Shuang also wore grey

1114
01:26:15,335 --> 01:26:18,499
Nan Yu is Mr Xiao's suspect

1115
01:26:18,619 --> 01:26:21,061
Who do you think they are against?

1116
01:26:21,181 --> 01:26:25,145
It appears it would be brother Qiu

1117
01:26:25,265 --> 01:26:27,588
That's for sure

1118
01:26:27,668 --> 01:26:30,431
What I don't understand is

1119
01:26:30,511 --> 01:26:33,594
He Huan Jade belongs to Nan Yu

1120
01:26:33,994 --> 01:26:35,596
Wouldn't he seek compensation?

1121
01:26:35,916 --> 01:26:37,438
I am aware of this

1122
01:26:37,558 --> 01:26:39,840
According to the report

1123
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:42,843
it was only insured for
100,000 tales of silver

1124
01:26:42,963 --> 01:26:45,566
but in fact it is worth 500,000

1125
01:26:45,686 --> 01:26:48,449
Nan Yu is not aware we know about this

1126
01:26:48,529 --> 01:26:50,771
and just wants to kill Brother Qiu
to silence him

1127
01:26:50,891 --> 01:26:54,054
so as people wouldn't know he has the Jade

1128
01:26:54,655 --> 01:26:57,377
I must go to Dong Gang to warn Brother Qiu

1129
01:26:57,498 --> 01:26:59,259
In case Nan Yu's men start the fight

1130
01:26:59,379 --> 01:27:01,221
I can give him a helping hand

1131
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:42,783
Nan Yu, I know it is you now

1132
01:27:42,863 --> 01:27:44,665
you needn't pretend anymore

1133
01:27:52,032 --> 01:27:54,835
Qiu Zi Yu, my archers are well trained

1134
01:27:54,915 --> 01:27:57,798
and their arrows are powerful

1135
01:27:57,878 --> 01:28:01,161
These arrows have pierced
your vital organs

1136
01:28:01,281 --> 01:28:03,644
You are merely relying on what you

1137
01:28:03,764 --> 01:28:05,646
learned from Mr Zi Dai

1138
01:28:05,726 --> 01:28:08,208
to seal off your pressure points
to stop the bleeding

1139
01:28:08,288 --> 01:28:11,412
but you'll die eventually

1140
01:28:11,532 --> 01:28:12,933
I know

1141
01:28:13,053 --> 01:28:14,575
But before I die, you scoundrel

1142
01:28:14,695 --> 01:28:16,857
I will kill you,

1143
01:28:16,977 --> 01:28:19,019
and retrieve the Jade
and give it to Xiao Zi Jing

1144
01:28:19,099 --> 01:28:22,543
Not necessarily. Come out, 8 killers

1145
01:30:26,106 --> 01:30:27,588
Four tigers attack

1146
01:31:02,463 --> 01:31:04,024
Flag formation

1147
01:31:11,271 --> 01:31:12,593
Six flag divisions

1148
01:31:25,005 --> 01:31:26,687
Encirclement of all flag divisions

1149
01:31:54,995 --> 01:31:56,276
Execute the sky net

1150
01:32:08,368 --> 01:32:09,850
Prepare the ground traps

1151
01:32:29,069 --> 01:32:30,431
Strengthen the 4 formations

1152
01:33:16,156 --> 01:33:20,801
Brother Qiu didn't claim the treasure
despite having it

1153
01:33:20,881 --> 01:33:22,883
He trusted you so much and you killed him?

1154
01:33:22,963 --> 01:33:25,045
He failed to escape from
my deadly flag formation

1155
01:33:25,165 --> 01:33:27,608
how do you compare with him?

1156
01:33:27,688 --> 01:33:32,653
We'll know when we fight

1157
01:34:07,488 --> 01:34:09,850
You're out of daggers,
but my flag formation still here

1158
01:34:09,970 --> 01:34:12,733
Today you'll be killed
by my pair of halberds

1159
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:23,824
My scabbard is like a sword
and mightier than normal ones

1160
01:34:23,944 --> 01:34:26,226
your flag would fail to deflect them

1161
01:34:28,068 --> 01:34:29,189
I don't believe it
