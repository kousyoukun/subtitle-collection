1
00:00:49,797 --> 00:00:51,559
片名：無法無天
CITY OF GOD

2
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:58,359
幹，雞跑了，快去追那只雞
Fuck, the chicken's got away!
Go after that chicken, man!

3
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:09,400
快點，捉住那只雞
Go on, for fuck's sake!
Get that chicken!

4
00:02:23,356 --> 00:02:26,052
拍得好我就能進報社
If it’s a good photo,
I'll get a job at the paper.

5
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:28,419
-是嗎？ -總得冒個險
-You think so, Rocket?
-Gotta take the risk.

6
00:02:28,627 --> 00:02:33,475
為一張照片賭命？算了吧
You'd risk your life
for a picture? Forget it!

7
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:37,166
你以為我愛惹那些流氓？
You think I want to meet up
with that motherfucking hood?

8
00:02:38,204 --> 00:02:42,072
老兄，捉住那只雞
Get that chicken, bro!

9
00:02:44,343 --> 00:02:49,707
媽的，叫你捉住，讓開
Motherfucker! I told you
to grab that chicken!
Outta my way!

10
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:51,917
捉住那只雞
Get that chicken!

11
00:03:11,537 --> 00:03:13,266
小霸王會宰了你
If Li’l Z' catches you,
he'll kill you.

12
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:17,905
他得先找到我
Yeah, well,
he's gotta find me first.

13
00:03:26,852 --> 00:03:31,429
小子，捉住那只雞
捉住那只雞
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!
Get that chicken!

14
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:34,356
媽的，條子
Shit! The cops!

15
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,824
不准跑
Don't fucking run off!

16
00:03:37,029 --> 00:03:38,826
給我
Give me that.

17
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,901
梅隆海，娘娘腔
Hey, Melonhead! You fucking fag!

18
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,461
一張照片可以改變我的人生
A picture could change
my life, but...

19
00:03:47,673 --> 00:03:50,938
但在天主之城，逃走會被逮到
in the City of God, if you
run away, they get you...

20
00:03:51,008 --> 00:03:55,343
留下來也會被逮到
他們正朝著我們來了
-They’re coming for us!
...and if you stay, they get you too.

21
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:57,876
從我小時候就是這樣
It's been that way
ever since I was a kid...

22
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:04,521
（60年代）
THE SIXTIES

23
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:13,031
你真沒用
You’re useless, man!

24
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:15,898
-去撿球啦 -廢物
-Go get the ball!
-Fucking useless!

25
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:20,198
小子，把球給我玩
Hey, kid!

26
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:23,432
Give me the ball, I wanna play.

27
00:04:25,244 --> 00:04:28,771
-又不是你的 -你想惹我嗎？
-It’s not yours.
-You wanna mess with me?

28
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:31,415
滾開
Fuck off.

29
00:04:31,617 --> 00:04:35,939
- 你叫什麼？
- 抱歉，忘了自我介紹
-What’s your name?
-Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself.

30
00:04:35,988 --> 00:04:38,513
-阿炮 -阿炮，聽我的話
-My name’s Rocket.
-Some advice, Rocket...

31
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,288
別讓小豆子碰球，他遜斃了
Don’t let Li’l Dice
touch that ball. He sucks.

32
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,786
-你輸了 -走，阿毛
-You lose, pal.
-Go, Shaggy!

33
00:04:44,997 --> 00:04:46,077
這是阿毛
That's Shaggy.

34
00:04:46,112 --> 00:04:51,049
天主之城的故事得從他說起
To tell the story of the City of God,
I have to start with him.

35
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:53,061
8，9，10，11…
8, 9, 10, 11...

36
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,743
不過要講他就得提到少年三俠
But in order to tell Shaggy's story, I
must tell the story of the Tender Trio.

37
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:05,283
阿毛，瓦斯車來了，你還混？不是怕了吧？
Well, Shaggy? The gas truck’s coming.
You’re not gonna chicken out...
What are you fucking around for?

38
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:12,292
（少年三俠的故事）
THE STORY OF THE TENDER TRIO

39
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,288
少年三俠在天主之城很有名
The notorious Tender Trio
was legendary in the City of God.

40
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,058
阿毛
Shaggy...

41
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:25,430
阿夾
Clipper...

42
00:05:26,105 --> 00:05:27,572
還有阿呆
and Goose.

43
00:05:29,508 --> 00:05:35,379
小豆子和阿毛的弟弟班尼是跟班
Li’l Dice and Benny...
Tagging along were always
Shaggy's brother.

44
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:40,312
我沒膽跟著我哥阿呆
I never had the courage
to follow my brother, Goose.

45
00:05:48,034 --> 00:05:50,896
快點
Okay, let’s go.

46
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:57,140
阿呆，快上
Let’s go!
Come on, Goose.

47
00:06:05,411 --> 00:06:07,379
停車
Stop! Stop!
Stop this fucker!

48
00:06:12,151 --> 00:06:15,985
停車，否則開槍
Stop or I’ll shoot, motherfucker!

49
00:06:16,188 --> 00:06:18,486
下車
Get out!

50
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:24,067
快下來，把錢拿來
Hurry up, asshole!
Gimme the money!

51
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,644
誰要瓦斯？
Who wants gas?

52
00:06:35,407 --> 00:06:38,934
你想為老闆的錢送命？
More! You wanna die for your
boss’ damn money?

53
00:06:39,144 --> 00:06:41,135
這裡有好多錢
Shitloads of money here!

54
00:06:43,282 --> 00:06:47,745
你活該，混蛋…
You see, asshole?
Asshole!

55
00:06:47,953 --> 00:06:49,921
靠，條子
Fuck! The cops!

56
00:06:53,259 --> 00:07:04,507
我們快離開這裡
快閃，到處都是條子
Let’s get outta here!
Clear out! The place is
crawling with cops!

57
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:31,628
-阿毛 -阿呆，給你
-Shaggy!
-The ball, Goose, it’s yours!

58
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:34,692
我曾以為少年三俠
Back then, I thought
the guys in the Tender Trio...

59
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,061
是里約熱內盧最狠的角色
were the most dangerous hoods
in Rio.

60
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:40,705
拿去買新球
Here! Buy some new balls.

61
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:45,709
其實他們只是半調子
But they were just amateurs.

62
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,573
我哥也一樣
這些給爸
-Even my brother, Goose.
-Rocket, give this money to dad.

63
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,486
別說是我給的，好嗎？
But don’t tell him it’s from me.
Okay?

64
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:02,425
-嗨，阿猛 -什麼事？
-Hey, Stringy!
-Yeah?

65
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,159
阿猛，我有好多錢
Look how much I’ve got.

66
00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:25,379
我們來天主之城尋找天堂
We came to the City of God
hoping to find paradise.

67
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:30,248
許多家庭毀於水災…
Many families were homeless
due to flooding...

68
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:32,856
和貧民區常見的縱火案
and acts of arson
in the ghettos.

69
00:08:33,058 --> 00:08:35,993
路燈，要有電了
-A light post!
-We’ll have electricity!

70
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:38,356
政府高官不是蓋的
The bigwigs in government
didn't joke around.

71
00:08:38,564 --> 00:08:42,473
無家可歸？去天主之城
Homeless? Off to City of God!

72
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,838
這裡沒電、路沒鋪、沒公車
There was no electricity,
paved streets or transportation.

73
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:49,168
但權貴者才不管我們死活
But for the rich and powerful
our problems didn't matter.

74
00:08:49,408 --> 00:08:52,377
里約熱內盧早已遺忘了我們
We were too far removed...

75
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:55,046
from the picture postcard image
of Rio de Janeiro.

76
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:14,494
你覺得我會成為救生員嗎？
Do you think I can become
a lifeguard one day?

77
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,531
我不知道
I don’t know.

78
00:09:16,735 --> 00:09:19,602
當救生員比賣魚好
Being a lifeguard is better
than a fishmonger.

79
00:09:19,805 --> 00:09:22,330
我不想賣魚，好臭
I don’t want to sell fish.
It stinks.

80
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,241
-你在罵你爸？ -不是
-Are you insulting your father?
-No.

81
00:09:25,978 --> 00:09:28,947
那你想當什麼？
So what do you want to be?

82
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:30,975
不知道
I don’t know.

83
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,777
-反正不當流氓或員警 -為什麼？
-Not a hood or a policeman.
-Why not?

84
00:09:34,987 --> 00:09:37,148
我怕中槍
I’m scared of getting shot.

85
00:09:41,627 --> 00:09:44,095
把槍收起來
Put that thing away, kid.
Are you nuts?

86
00:09:44,296 --> 00:09:47,763
拿槍指著我，你瘋啦？
Pointing that gun at me?

87
00:09:47,798 --> 00:09:51,231
別這麼凶，小豆子是我弟
Take it easy with the kid, Goose.
Li’l Dice is with me.

88
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:54,270
對啊，我也是流氓
Right, I'm a gangster too.

89
00:09:54,473 --> 00:09:56,733
這次沒搶到多少
-That gas truck didn't bring much.
-So what?

90
00:09:56,768 --> 00:10:00,938
反正我們每天都搶，一天一台
-We rob gas trucks every day.
-One today, another tomorrow.

91
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,441
我們得搶有錢人
No, we need to rob
some rich guy’s house.

92
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:06,083
才能離開這裡
That’s the only
way to get outta here.

93
00:10:06,285 --> 00:10:09,584
不對，你們應該聽我的
Hell, no. What you need
is to follow my plan.

94
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:11,221
That’s it.

95
00:10:11,423 --> 00:10:15,519
小鬼頭很屌喔
The little fart’s getting
too big for his britches!

96
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:24,834
哈了麻就開始胡扯
He gets high and starts
talking bullshit.

97
00:10:25,037 --> 00:10:30,202
你們兩個還不及他的一半
You two junkies aren't worth
half as much as that kid.

98
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,070
你有什麼主意？
What you got in mind, Li’l Dice?

99
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,876
混兄弟除了有槍，還要有點子
To be a real hood you need
more than just a gun. You need ideas.

100
00:10:43,088 --> 00:10:45,181
小豆子就有
And Li’l Dice had them.

101
00:10:46,358 --> 00:10:49,226
-就是這家？ -對
-Is that the motel?
-Yeah.

102
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:53,994
進去搶了錢就閃，不要殺人
We go in, grab the money and
get out. No killing, got that?

103
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:55,419
我需要槍
-I need this.
-Don’t touch my gun, kid.

104
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:59,390
-別碰我的槍 -不准再打我
Don’t ever do that again.

105
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,904
-別指著我 -笨蛋
-Don’t point at me.
-Fuck you.

106
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:04,602
-別用手指著我 -少幼稚了
-Don’t point your finger at me!
-Stop acting like a baby!

107
00:11:04,674 --> 00:11:06,608
這把給你
Here’s yours.

108
00:11:06,712 --> 00:11:09,112
-酷 -走吧
-Awesome!
-Let’s go!

109
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:11,839
-等一下 -幹嘛？
-Not so fast!
-What?

110
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,518
你留著把風
You stay here and keep watch.

111
00:11:14,786 --> 00:11:20,088
條子來了就射那扇窗戶
If the cops come, shoot that
window over there.

112
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:23,193
-為什麼？叫那個呆子做 -聽著…
-Why me? Let that dork do that.
-Look...

113
00:11:23,395 --> 00:11:29,282
我免費提供計畫
那傢伙最沒用了
I gave you this great plan, for free...
While that guy’s absolutely useless!

114
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,412
-你只有點子 -沒錯
-You just had the idea.
-Exactly!

115
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:33,829
You’re just a kid, remember?
你還小

116
00:11:33,872 --> 00:11:36,602
你掩護我們
You cover us, okay?

117
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:42,376
遲早會輪到你，不要心急
You’ll get your turn, so cool it.
Stop trying to rush things.

118
00:11:42,581 --> 00:11:44,710
留在這裡
You stay there.

119
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,840
（出口）

120
00:11:48,887 --> 00:11:52,015
這是搶劫
This is a hold-up, bitch.

121
00:11:55,127 --> 00:11:58,630
你們應該去上學或工作
You should be studying or working.
You don't even look like hoodlums.

122
00:11:58,665 --> 00:12:06,626
你們甚至不像流氓
你們應該去工作…
Instead, you ought to be
working or studying, boy.

123
00:12:06,661 --> 00:12:09,071
閉嘴，煩死了
Shut up!
What a pain in the ass!

124
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:11,805
好了嗎？
Okay, Clipper?

125
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:15,244
進去吧
Shall we go in?

126
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:22,850
我沒有點東西
I didn't order anything.

127
00:12:23,055 --> 00:12:27,185
旅館請客，把錢交出來
It’s on the house, sir.
Hand over the money!

128
00:12:27,392 --> 00:12:29,656
別怕，我只要你的現金和皮夾
Keep calm, all I want
is your cash.

129
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:31,453
-別指著我… -你的皮夾…
-Don’t point that...
-Your wallet...

130
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:47,806
老兄，這是什麼妓院？
Hey, man...
What kind of whorehouse is this?

131
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:53,609
你信教？ 對
-You from the church?
-Yes, brother.

132
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:57,677
拿錢來
Give it to me!

133
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:01,188
賤人
Slut!

134
00:13:01,426 --> 00:13:03,223
你人老肉又塌
You're old, fat and flabby!

135
00:13:04,196 --> 00:13:06,494
想跟她一樣嗎？
Wanna take her place?

136
00:13:10,969 --> 00:13:13,130
怎麼回事？
What’s going on?

137
00:13:14,272 --> 00:13:16,968
-條子，快跑 讓我們修理它 -快
-The cops! Let’s beat it!
-Let’s go!

138
00:13:22,114 --> 00:13:25,606
開那輛車，我去叫小豆子
Take that car.
I'll go get Li’l Dice.

139
00:13:26,985 --> 00:13:29,419
好屌的車
Jesus, what a car!

140
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,536
-小豆子不見了 -條子開槍了，走吧
-Something fucked up. Li’l Dice’s gone.
-The cops are shooting, let’s go!

141
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:09,592
慢一點，等一下
Slow down! Hold on...

142
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:13,809
你說你會開車
我會啊，別吵
-You said you knew how to drive.
-I do, so cool it!

143
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:16,856
轉彎，小心
Turn! Watch out!

144
00:14:29,147 --> 00:14:30,910
你這個混蛋
You fucking asshole!

145
00:14:31,983 --> 00:14:34,679
我又不是故意的
Hey, I didn’t do it on purpose.

146
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:39,259
你們什麼都沒看到
不准多嘴
No one saw anything.
So keep your mouths shut, understand?

147
00:14:42,294 --> 00:14:45,011
等等，我扭到了
Hold on, I twisted my ankle.

148
00:14:45,046 --> 00:14:47,729
阿夾扭到了
Goose fucked up his ankle.

149
00:14:47,764 --> 00:14:48,922
好痛
It fucking hurts.

150
00:14:49,134 --> 00:14:52,352
帶他進樹林，我開槍引開員警
Take him into the woods.
I’ll shoot to distract the cops.

151
00:14:52,387 --> 00:14:55,570
-我們信靠神 -我們信靠神
-In God we trust.
-In God we trust.

152
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:02,743
把電話給我
Pass me the telephone, Penguin.

153
00:15:02,948 --> 00:15:06,850
矮子在天主之城也很有名
Shorty is another notorious guy
in the City of God.

154
00:15:07,052 --> 00:15:09,077
待會再來聊他
But it's not yet time
to tell his story.

155
00:15:10,955 --> 00:15:15,766
阿呆，我好痛
閉嘴
-It fucking hurts, Goose.
-Shut up.

156
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:20,578
等一下，你好娘娘腔
-Wait up...
-You sound like a damn sissy, man.

157
00:15:24,502 --> 00:15:27,767
-把手給我 爬上來
-沒有人看到？
-Give me your hand! Climb up!
-No one saw anything?

158
00:15:27,972 --> 00:15:32,807
怪了，一輛車沖進酒吧
卻沒有人看到
How odd! A car crashes
into a bar and no one saw a thing.

159
00:15:33,011 --> 00:15:36,003
你也沒看到吧？
I suppose you didn’t see
anything either?

160
00:15:36,214 --> 00:15:39,945
還是一樣一問三不知
As usual, no one saw,
no one knows.

161
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:44,143
矮子，你好嗎？
So what’s up, Shorty?

162
00:15:44,823 --> 00:15:47,587
他們躲在林子裡
They’re hiding in the woods.

163
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:50,455
-梅隆海 -你打算怎麼做？
-Hello, Melonhead.
-How are you doing?

164
00:15:50,462 --> 00:15:53,898
我覺得他們在樹林裡
I have this feeling that
they’re out in the woods.

165
00:15:54,132 --> 00:15:57,830
-應該錯不了 -該死
-The motherfuckers.
-They’re out in the woods.

166
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,633
菲利浦，鎖車，藍傑，跟我來
Felipe, lock up the car.
Rangel, come with me.

167
00:16:06,044 --> 00:16:10,677
這麼暗，他們怎麼看得到
I can’t see a thing.
How the hell can they see?

168
00:16:09,514 --> 00:16:12,539
爛樹林
Fucking jungle.

169
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:20,282
-他們搶了不少 -我知道
-They stole a fortune at that motel.
-I know.

170
00:16:22,627 --> 00:16:25,289
我們把錢吞了吧
What if we took the money?

171
00:16:25,797 --> 00:16:29,961
你瘋了嗎？我不想汙錢
Are you crazy?
I’m not getting mixed up in that.

172
00:16:30,168 --> 00:16:32,728
我要剷除他們
I want to exterminate these guys.

173
00:16:32,937 --> 00:16:37,237
偷黑人和賊的錢又不犯法
What? Since when is stealing from
niggers and thieves a crime?

174
00:16:37,575 --> 00:16:44,242
要捉他們並不難，我有眼線
It won't be hard to nab them.
I have a stoolie in the City.

175
00:17:09,107 --> 00:17:15,774
-你聽到槍聲了嗎？
-被我逮到就死定了
-Did you hear those shots?
-If I catch one of them, I'll kill him.

176
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:29,049
瑪拉卡娜
Maracana!

177
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,555
快開門
Open the door.

178
00:17:33,832 --> 00:17:37,563
-怎麼了？-條子在追我
-What’s the matter?
-The cops are after me.

179
00:17:45,944 --> 00:17:47,343
阿毛…阿毛
Shaggy!

180
00:17:48,546 --> 00:17:53,440
條子就在後面，借我躲
-Shaggy!
-The cops are on my ass!

181
00:17:51,616 --> 00:17:55,302
快進來
-Hide me!
-Quick, come in.

182
00:18:02,694 --> 00:18:07,980
媽的
就知道會耗上整晚
Shit... I thought the cops
would be down there all night.

183
00:18:08,366 --> 00:18:11,267
我看到一個景象
I had a vision, Goose.

184
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:14,733
你有哈麻嗎？
You been smoking something?

185
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:17,906
-你工作過對吧？ -對
-You've had a job, right?
-Yeah.

186
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:20,168
別人怎麼說？
What’s it like?
What do people say?

187
00:18:20,378 --> 00:18:22,505
我是在幫我爸
I worked with my father.

188
00:18:22,714 --> 00:18:26,275
當爸爸的屁話最多了
And fathers talk a lot of shit.

189
00:18:27,518 --> 00:18:31,545
你知道嗎？
我不幹了
You know what, Goose?
I'm getting out, I don't want to die.

190
00:18:31,756 --> 00:18:37,571
-我不適合混兄弟 -等等，條子還沒走
-This gangster’s life isn’t for me.
-Wait! The cops are still down there.

191
00:18:37,606 --> 00:18:40,024
我不在乎
I don’t give a shit.

192
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,862
我要回教會
I'm going back to the church.

193
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,563
住在至高者隱密處的
He that dwells in the secret
place of the most High...

194
00:18:47,772 --> 00:18:52,108
必住在全能者的蔭下
shall abide under the shadow of
the Almighty. I will say of the Lord...

195
00:18:51,342 --> 00:18:55,778
我要論到耶和華說
He is my refuge and my fortress,
in Him will I trust.

196
00:18:55,813 --> 00:18:59,044
他是我的避難所，是我的山寨 是我所倚靠的
Fear not the terror by night,
nor the arrow that flies by day...

197
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,277
你必不怕黑夜的驚駭 或是白日飛的箭
也不怕黑夜行的瘟疫 或是午間…
nor the pestilence that walks
in darkness, nor the destruction...

198
00:19:03,488 --> 00:19:07,356
-站住，不准動 -站住
-Stop, motherfucker!
-Don’t move!

199
00:19:07,692 --> 00:19:11,128
否則開槍
Stop, or I’ll shoot!

200
00:19:12,764 --> 00:19:17,792
必住在全能者的蔭下…
...shall abide under the shadow
of the Almighty.

201
00:19:18,002 --> 00:19:22,769
這是城裡最血腥的一起搶案
The hold-up at the motel went down
as the bloodiest in history.

202
00:19:22,974 --> 00:19:25,807
三俠的命運就此分歧
The destinies of the outlaws
then took different paths.

203
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:29,446
我覺得他不是搶匪
I don’t think this guy
was involved in the heist.

204
00:19:29,647 --> 00:19:31,546
你看
See here?

205
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:36,953
-他是工人，不是流氓
-我現在說他是
-He’s a worker, not a hoodlum.
-I’ll make him one now.

206
00:19:40,224 --> 00:19:44,524
命運讓阿夾重回上帝懷抱
Destiny put Clipper
back into the hands of God.

207
00:19:46,064 --> 00:19:50,228
讓阿毛愛上貝妮絲
Shaggy was in Bernice's hands.

208
00:19:51,869 --> 00:19:55,396
讓阿呆回來找我爸
And Goose was
in my father's hands.

209
00:19:55,606 --> 00:19:59,098
為什麼做壞事？當我是白癡？
Why do you do these things?
You think I’m a fool?

210
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,006
以後跟著我賣魚
From now on,
you’ll work with me.

211
00:20:02,213 --> 00:20:06,377
你弟會幫忙盯著你
Your younger brother
will keep an eye on you.

212
00:20:06,584 --> 00:20:07,852
你給我聽好
You listen to me.

213
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:13,155
你再去搶錢，我就宰了你
If I catch you with money that
isn't yours, I'll kill you.

214
00:20:13,358 --> 00:20:19,228
你也一樣
你也一樣，快換衣服上工
That goes for you too. Get changed!
You start work immediately.

215
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:25,244
哥哥是流氓
遭殃的總是你
Having a hood as a brother sucks.
You always end up footing the bill.

216
00:20:25,403 --> 00:20:34,277
放心，爸氣完就沒事了
Don’t worry.
Dad’s mad at me...
but he’ll get over it.

217
00:20:37,415 --> 00:20:41,540
拿來，這不是你該碰的
你要念書
Give me that, Rocket. It’s not
for you. You have to study.

218
00:20:41,686 --> 00:20:45,599
-你不怕挨槍嗎？-我腦筋不好
-Getting shot doesn’t scare you?
-I’m a hood because I got no brain.

219
00:20:45,634 --> 00:20:49,242
你很聰明，應該念書
But you’re smart.
You should study.

220
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,859
我上學是因為討厭勞動
I go to school because
I don’t like physical work.

221
00:20:53,398 --> 00:20:57,994
答應我絕不碰這把槍，好嗎？
Promise me something... That you’ll
never touch this gun. Promise?

222
00:20:58,736 --> 00:21:00,795
握手為定
Let’s shake.

223
00:21:02,306 --> 00:21:04,866
動作快
We’d better hurry.

224
00:21:06,144 --> 00:21:09,671
我要賣很多魚，不要笑
I’m gonna sell a lot of fish.
And don’t laugh.

225
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:11,644
我挨打時你還偷笑
You grinned when I got slapped.

226
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:13,749
-我？ -我看見了
-Who, me?
-I saw you.

227
00:21:41,712 --> 00:21:45,204
怎麼？舌頭打結了？
What is it, Shaggy?
Cat got your tongue?

228
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,010
你這樣晃我會緊張
Your fidgeting behind me
makes me nervous.

229
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:52,383
-我在想該說什麼 -你也會思考？
-I'm thinking of what to say to you.
-You’re thinking, as well?

230
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,922
小心出事
Don’t. It’ll be your downfall.

231
00:21:55,126 --> 00:21:59,392
我為你傾心，我很重感覺
My heart has chosen you.
And I follow my heart.

232
00:21:59,597 --> 00:22:02,031
你在耍我嗎？
Are you pulling my leg?

233
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:05,396
你沒聽過一見鍾情嗎？
You never heard of
love at first sight?

234
00:22:06,037 --> 00:22:11,031
-兄弟沒有情，只有欲望
-你老是打斷我的話
-Hoods don’t love, they desire.
-You cut down everything I say.

235
00:22:11,242 --> 00:22:14,939
兄弟不說話，只說花言巧語
Hoods don’t talk,
they smooth-talk.

236
00:22:15,146 --> 00:22:18,479
那我就不浪費口水了
Well, I’ll stop wasting
my breath on you.

237
00:22:18,683 --> 00:22:22,210
兄弟從不罷手，只會先暫停
Hoods don't stop,
they take a break.

238
00:22:23,221 --> 00:22:25,712
跟你求愛真複雜
Talking to you about love
sure is complicated.

239
00:22:25,923 --> 00:22:29,450
這不是愛，是騙局
It’s not love,
it’s a con game.

240
00:22:45,743 --> 00:22:48,177
可是我愛你
It’s just that I love you.

241
00:22:49,213 --> 00:22:52,808
你或許會說服我
You just might end up
convincing me...

242
00:23:14,805 --> 00:23:19,799
案發後，員警經常跑來搜查
After the hold-up, there were
constant police raids in the ghetto.

243
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:31,315
每天都有人入獄
有人被捕
Every day, someone went to jail,
someone was nailed.

244
00:23:33,157 --> 00:23:37,218
但每個人都一問三不知
But no one had seen anything.
No one knew anything.

245
00:23:38,629 --> 00:23:43,999
沒有人向警方透露搶匪的去處
No one blabbed to the cops about
where the thieves were hiding out.

246
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,304
（3個月後）
3 MONTHS LATER

247
00:23:48,506 --> 00:23:53,207
阿毛，你怎麼不改變一下？
Why don’t you change your life?
Shaggy...

248
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:57,375
去找份工作，別整天賴床
Get a job instead of
lying around in bed all day.

249
00:23:57,582 --> 00:24:00,415
-一無是處 -什麼意思？
-Good-for-nothing!
-What do you mean?

250
00:24:00,618 --> 00:24:03,587
你工作就能賺錢？
You think you can make money
working? Go ahead.

251
00:24:04,255 --> 00:24:08,658
沒錯，你以為我在忙什麼？
That’s right, Shaggy...
what do you think I do all day?

252
00:24:11,596 --> 00:24:19,656
別激動
我只想跟你生孩子，買塊地
Take it easy, baby... you know all
I want is to be with you, have kids...

253
00:24:17,935 --> 00:24:22,497
養養雞，種大麻來抽
and a farm, raise chickens,
grow pot and get high.

254
00:24:22,707 --> 00:24:26,575
是啊，都是花言巧語
Sure! For me, that’s
nothing but smooth-talk.

255
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:40,753
我搶那次差點就發了
What? I almost got
rich with that motel job.

256
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:41,947
有沒有搞錯
Are you kidding?

257
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,726
條子還在為那裡的命案找你
The cops are still looking for you
because of the deaths in the motel.

258
00:24:48,199 --> 00:24:51,066
什麼命案？你說什麼？
What deaths?
What are you talking about?

259
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:54,727
你是目擊者嗎？不懂就閉嘴
Did you see anything?
You don’t know shit, so shut up.

260
00:24:54,939 --> 00:24:58,067
你又不在，我沒有殺人
You weren’t there.
I didn’t kill anyone.

261
00:24:58,276 --> 00:25:01,973
一定是員警殺人，找我頂罪
I bet it’s those fucking policemen,
and I’m the one taking the rap.

262
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:06,979
他們還捉了小豆子 別再提了
They even nabbed Li’l Dice.
So don't bring it up again!

263
00:25:07,285 --> 00:25:10,083
-我不管是誰幹的 -不是我
-I don't care who did it.
-It wasn’t me.

264
00:25:10,288 --> 00:25:14,554
我這麼說吧，我不要跟流氓生孩子
Let me just say... I don’t want my
kid’s father to be a hoodlum.

265
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:16,158
你沒人理了
You’re all alone, Shaggy.

266
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,916
-沒人理？ -沒錯
-All alone?
-That’s right!

267
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:20,259
-阿夾去信教 -哈利路亞
-Clipper’s gone religious.
-Hallelujah!

268
00:25:20,464 --> 00:25:22,159
-阿呆在工作 -馬屁精
-Goose is working.
-Ass-kisser!

269
00:25:22,366 --> 00:25:24,493
-你呢？ -我沒變，那又怎樣？
-And you?
-I haven’t changed. So what?

270
00:25:24,702 --> 00:25:29,002
是他們背棄我
They’ve deserted me,
that’s all.

271
00:25:29,206 --> 00:25:31,367
那我也要這麼做
Then I’m deserting you too.

272
00:25:31,575 --> 00:25:34,066
我要離開這裡，你想來就來
I’m splitting, Shaggy.
Come with me, if you want.

273
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:38,146
否則我自己走
Otherwise, I’ll go alone.

魚貨大特價
Fish for sale!

275
00:25:55,032 --> 00:25:58,001
我哥答應不再鬼混
My brother had promised
to stop messing around.

276
00:25:58,202 --> 00:26:04,670
但兄弟從不罷手
只會先暫停
But a hood doesn't stop,
a hood takes a break.

277
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:08,174
阿呆搞上了矮子的老婆
Goose began messing around
with Shorty's wife.

278
00:26:08,646 --> 00:26:13,083
我特地為你這種貴客
I have trout. But for special
customers like you...

279
00:26:13,284 --> 00:26:16,253
準備了接吻魚
I also have a kisser fish.

280
00:26:16,454 --> 00:26:18,786
那是鯡魚
Hey, that’s a mullet!

281
00:26:21,592 --> 00:26:25,754
你老公會替你口交嗎？
Doesn’t your husband...
go down on you?

282
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:28,455
不會
No.

283
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,996
我老公都會先幫我口交半小時
Mine, before entering me,
has to use his tongue.

284
00:26:32,203 --> 00:26:36,867
你有讓他肛交嗎？
For about half an hour.
And from behind? Do you let him?

285
00:26:37,074 --> 00:26:42,273
當然沒有，不會痛嗎？
前幾次會
-Good God, no. Doesn’t it hurt?
-The first few times.

286
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,211
之後可爽了，不過得準備香蕉
Then you’ll see, it’s fantastic.
But you need a banana.

287
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:47,907
幹什麼？
What for?

288
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:51,111
你真不懂得享樂
You’re missing the good things
in life, girl!

289
00:26:51,322 --> 00:26:54,390
你把香蕉準備好
You take a banana, warm it up...

290
00:26:54,425 --> 00:26:58,156
後面上了，前面就塞香蕉
Put it up your thing, while he
takes you from behind.

291
00:26:58,362 --> 00:27:02,560
爽死了
去問你老公
It’s a real rush!
Ask your husband.

292
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:07,534
不行，你不瞭解他，他八成會揍我
I couldn’t. You don’t know him.
He’s liable to beat me.

293
00:27:07,738 --> 00:27:11,435
試試看，男人最愛這種花招
Try him. Men go wild
for smut like that.

294
00:27:18,983 --> 00:27:21,383
死黑鬼
Motherfucking nigger!

295
00:27:23,621 --> 00:27:25,953
蕩婦
Slut!

296
00:27:27,124 --> 00:27:29,524
賤人
Whoring bitch!

297
00:27:32,229 --> 00:27:36,495
阿炮，把短褲給我，快
Rocket, give me your shorts.
Quick!

298
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,966
-快脫下來
-我才不要光屁股
-Take them off, dammit!
-I'm not going naked in the street.

299
00:27:41,172 --> 00:27:45,040
你想看我死嗎？
快把短褲給我
You want your brother to die?
Give me your shorts. Now!

300
00:27:45,075 --> 00:27:47,073
你的衣服給我
Give me your shirt.

301
00:27:50,047 --> 00:27:52,015
你的短褲，快點
Your shorts! Hurry up!

302
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:58,851
每次我都得替他擦屁股
I knew it. It’s always me
who forks up for that bum.

303
00:28:06,897 --> 00:28:09,832
那個混蛋跑了，那是他弟弟
The bastard ran off.
That's his brother.

304
00:28:10,034 --> 00:28:12,229
-那個小鬼？ -我要閹了那傢伙
-That brat there?
-I’ll castrate that fucker.

306
00:28:20,611 --> 00:28:23,273
小朋友，過來
Hey, kid, come over here.

307
00:28:24,181 --> 00:28:27,241
-你哥呢？ -他今天沒上工
-Where’s your brother?
-He’s not working today.

308
00:28:27,451 --> 00:28:30,181
-上車 -我又沒做壞事
-Oh yeah? Get in.
-I didn’t do anything.

309
00:28:30,387 --> 00:28:32,378
-上車 -那魚呢？
-Get in!
-What about my fish?

310
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,946
快點
-Hurry it up, kid!
-I don’t want to lose my fish!

311
00:28:33,981 --> 00:28:39,885
-我不想把魚扔著 -別管魚了
-給我那個 -坐下
-Forget your fish.
-Sit your ass down.

312
00:28:40,097 --> 00:28:44,183
-無所謂
-我爸會殺了我
-My father will kill me.
-That doesn’t matter.

313
00:28:55,246 --> 00:28:57,441
走吧，什麼都沒有
Let’s go.
There’s nothing here.

314
00:28:57,648 --> 00:29:01,584
那天，爸發誓再也不想見我哥
That day, my father swore he never
wanted to see my brother again.

315
00:29:01,785 --> 00:29:03,412
走吧
Let’s go, Felipe.

316
00:29:06,624 --> 00:29:09,923
確實沒有人再見到他
And he never did. No one ever
saw him in the ghetto again.

317
00:29:10,127 --> 00:29:13,585
少年三俠的故事即將結束
The story of the Tender Trio
was coming to an end.

318
00:29:15,566 --> 00:29:20,731
小豆子？媽的，我以為你掛了
Li’l Dice? Shit, man. I thought you
were a goner at the motel.

319
00:29:20,938 --> 00:29:27,768
-你好有錢
-別給他，那是我們的
-You’re fucking loaded!
-Don’t, Benny. That’s our money.

320
00:29:28,212 --> 00:29:32,046
去你的，少廢話，錢拿來
Fuck you. Cut the crap
and give me the money.

321
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:37,077
班尼，告訴阿毛矮子告密了
Benny... Tell your brother Shaggy
that Shorty is squealing.

322
00:29:37,454 --> 00:29:42,440
我要離開這裡
但矮子忙得很
-I'm leaving the ghetto.
-But Shorty had his hands full...

323
00:29:55,173 --> 00:29:58,073
阿猛，快
Let’s go see, Stringy.

324
00:30:07,451 --> 00:30:11,251
天亮前有鄰居報警
A neighbor called the police
before sunrise.

325
00:30:11,455 --> 00:30:14,219
小報也跑來了
The tabloids went to town:

326
00:30:14,425 --> 00:30:17,588
※狠心丈夫活埋妻子§
"Man Buries Wife Alive
in the City of God"

327
00:30:17,795 --> 00:30:20,662
除了記者，還來了一堆條子
Along with reporters, the place
was swarming with cops.

328
00:30:20,864 --> 00:30:24,800
流氓都閃光了
The hoodlums took off.

329
00:30:26,403 --> 00:30:30,003
-你找死啊？ -是你找死
-You wanna die?
-It’s you who’s gonna die...

330
00:30:29,473 --> 00:30:33,603
if you don’t do what I say.
照我的話去做 對她客氣一點
And show the lady more respect.

331
00:30:36,113 --> 00:30:37,671
快開車
Let’s go, dammit!

332
00:30:37,881 --> 00:30:40,611
-前面有條子 -管他的，開車
-There are cops ahead.
-Fuck them, let’s go.

333
00:30:40,818 --> 00:30:43,480
-去哪裡？ -隨便，快走
-Where to?
-Anywhere, just go.

334
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:49,142
-怎麼搞的？
-我的天哪
-What’s the matter?
-Have mercy!

335
00:30:49,177 --> 00:30:50,413
饒了我吧，這輛車很破
-This car’s a piece of junk.
-My ass! Start the damn thing!

336
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:54,921
-少來，快發動 -得下去推車
It needs a push.

337
00:30:56,266 --> 00:30:58,131
快去
Push, Shaggy!

338
00:30:58,335 --> 00:30:59,825
去啊
Push!

339
00:31:13,117 --> 00:31:17,486
是你？
You?

340
00:31:18,155 --> 00:31:20,988
你想捉賊？在那邊
You want to arrest the thieves?
Over there...

341
00:31:21,191 --> 00:31:24,354
捉住那個人
Nab that guy over there!

342
00:31:48,652 --> 00:31:50,745
阿毛，快點
Run, Shaggy!

343
00:31:50,954 --> 00:31:54,355
停車
Stop the car!

344
00:32:35,766 --> 00:32:46,353
-這邊，他在那裡
-抓住那傢伙
-This way! He’s over here.
-We got that sonofabitch!

345
00:32:48,581 --> 00:33:00,112
-笨蛋 -他是兇手
-He’s a murderer.
-The bastard!

346
00:33:00,324 --> 00:33:04,317
阿毛死的那天，有人群圍觀
On the day Shaggy died
I remember the crowds...

347
00:33:04,528 --> 00:33:07,190
還有人照相
and a camera.

348
00:33:07,397 --> 00:33:10,662
我一直想要一台相機
I’d always wanted to have one.

349
00:33:12,402 --> 00:33:15,497
去上學吧
Let’s go to school.

350
00:33:24,314 --> 00:33:26,282
-如何？ -去海邊吧
-Well?
-Let’s go to the beach.

351
00:33:26,483 --> 00:33:27,814
但是要考試
But we have an exam.

352
00:33:28,018 --> 00:33:31,722
那又怎樣？
So what?

353
00:33:31,889 --> 00:33:34,483
其他人都去了
Everyone else is at the beach.

354
00:33:34,691 --> 00:33:37,683
走吧
Come on, let’s go!

355
00:33:37,895 --> 00:33:41,296
她穿比基尼還不去
She’s in a bikini,
but doesn’t want to go.

356
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:46,401
你到底有什麼？
What’s that saying you have?

357
00:33:46,603 --> 00:33:49,766
海邊不是人人都能去的
The sun is for everyone. The beach,
for those who deserve it.

358
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:54,640
（70年代）
THE SEVENTIES

359
00:33:54,187 --> 00:33:56,745
看這邊
我16歲買了第一台相機
-Over here!
-I bought my first camera...

360
00:33:56,947 --> 00:34:01,225
我很窮，所以從等級最低
when I was 16. Like all poor people,
I started at the bottom...

361
00:34:01,652 --> 00:34:04,120
最便宜的機種買起
with the world's cheapest model.

362
00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:08,020
阿炮，怎麼樣？
So, Rocket?
How are things going?

363
00:34:08,225 --> 00:34:10,284
開葷了沒？
Any luck getting laid yet?

364
00:34:10,494 --> 00:34:12,587
還沒
Zilch.

365
00:34:13,862 --> 00:34:19,198
安潔莉卡，我為她瘋狂
你還在拍？
-Angelica. I was crazy about her.
-So, Rocket, still clicking away?

366
00:34:19,401 --> 00:34:23,599
她很漂亮，而且有經驗
She was gorgeous and the only
girl in our gang who screwed.

367
00:34:23,805 --> 00:34:25,796
我想跟她做第一次
I wanted to lose
my virginity with her.

368
00:34:26,007 --> 00:34:29,743
跟她？她有男朋友
With her, buddy?
She’s got a guy.

369
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:33,009
-我又沒吃醋
-她爸是軍人
-So? I’m not jealous.
-Her father’s a sergeant.

370
00:34:33,215 --> 00:34:37,049
人都有缺點
往中間靠
No one’s perfect.
Closer together!

371
00:34:37,252 --> 00:34:39,516
我是這票朋友裡的攝影師
I was the official
photographer of our gang.

372
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:47,219
我們自稱爵士人
大家都會付錢跟我買照片
The gang of groovies. Everyone
paid to have copies of the pictures.

373
00:34:52,901 --> 00:34:56,098
提亞哥，往後一點
Thiago, move back a little.

374
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:59,102
這樣行嗎？
很好
-Is this okay?
-Perfect.

375
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:09,081
我想抽大麻
I need a joint.

376
00:35:09,284 --> 00:35:14,051
別抽了，現在流行吸白粉
Instead of smoking, man,
you should snort coke. It’s far out.

377
00:35:14,256 --> 00:35:18,158
你有在吸？我比較喜歡哈麻
You snort, Thiago?
I prefer a good toke.

378
00:35:20,228 --> 00:35:24,278
我可以幫你弄到貨
If you like,
I can get it for you.

379
00:35:23,698 --> 00:35:28,328
是嗎？那就快去
You can? Then go on,
move your ass!

380
00:35:28,536 --> 00:35:32,302
但白粉才優，是真正的醉麻劑
But the choice stuff is coke.
That’s a real nercotic.

381
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:34,839
是麻醉劑
Narcotic!

382
00:35:37,145 --> 00:35:41,710
你的嘴好鹹
去你的
-Your mouth is all salty, Thiago.
-Screw you.

383
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:44,145
阿猛，你想當救生員？
You want to be
a lifeguard, Stringy?

384
00:35:44,352 --> 00:35:46,843
-你從不下水 -你說什麼？
-You’re never in the water.
-My dad’s a lifeguard.

385
00:35:47,055 --> 00:35:50,991
-賭一罐啤酒我比你行
-賭了
-I’ll bet you a beer I swim better.
-You’re on.

386
00:35:53,795 --> 00:35:57,595
我可以去找黑仔弄一根
If you like, I can go get you
a joint at Blacky’s.

387
00:36:10,645 --> 00:36:13,705
我願意為她做任何事
I’d have done anything
to please her...

388
00:36:14,849 --> 00:36:17,409
替她買大麻、白粉
Buy her pot, coke...

389
00:36:21,623 --> 00:36:27,228
我可以去找角頭
用低價買到好貨
I could go to the top dogs to buy
quality stuff at a good price...

390
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:34,498
因為角頭黑仔是我的老同學
because the local boss
was a former classmate: Blacky.

391
00:36:36,004 --> 00:36:38,974
誰？
阿炮
-Who is it?
-Rocket.

392
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:45,175
-最近好嗎？ -很好
-How are things down there?
-Fine.

393
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,473
-其他人呢？ -也很好
-And the kids?
-Fine too.

394
00:36:47,682 --> 00:36:49,582
-你想買還是抽？
-買
-You want to buy or smoke a joint?
-Buy.

395
00:36:49,784 --> 00:36:54,551
進來
Come in, buddy.

396
00:36:56,124 --> 00:37:00,618
誰？是誰？
Who is it?

397
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,600
這是黑仔的地盤
This was Blacky's turf.

398
00:37:07,802 --> 00:37:11,397
但原本也不是他的
But it hadn't always been his.

399
00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:16,576
-黑仔 -靠，小豆子
-Hey, Blacky.
-Fuck, Li’l Dice.

400
00:37:16,611 --> 00:37:21,343
來我這裡還帶人
誰說這裡是你的？
-You show up like this at my place?
-Who said it was your place?

401
00:37:22,384 --> 00:37:27,845
（這間公寓的故事） 杜菲賽麗守寡之後開始販毒
THE STORY OF THE APARTMENT
Dona Zelia began selling drugs here...

402
00:37:28,056 --> 00:37:32,049
好養活她的女兒
when her husband died,
in order to raise her daughters.

403
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:37,664
她會送毒品給為她服務的男孩
She also gave away drugs to boys at
times in return for special favors.

404
00:37:37,866 --> 00:37:43,566
她最喜歡大個兒
後來大個兒長大了
Her favorite was "Big Boy".
One day, he grew very big!

405
00:37:43,772 --> 00:37:48,835
賽麗太外行，三兩下就被取代
Zelia's operation was so amateur that
he had no trouble seizing it from her.

406
00:37:49,744 --> 00:37:54,238
大個兒利用青少年販毒
Big Boy used the neighborhood
kids as dealers.

407
00:37:54,783 --> 00:37:59,225
那我的份呢？
去吃屎吧
-What about my pot?
-Stick it up your ass.

408
00:37:59,354 --> 00:38:02,118
最會做生意的…
The best dealer...

409
00:38:03,758 --> 00:38:06,591
是紅毛
...was Carrot.

410
00:38:06,795 --> 00:38:09,423
-我可以喝一口嗎？ -當然
-Can I have a sip?
-Sure.

411
00:38:09,631 --> 00:38:12,259
他贏得信任，被升為經理
He earned Big Boy's trust...

412
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:15,459
was promoted, and moved up to
become a manager.

413
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:19,333
黑仔，我們20你5
Blacky, 20 for us and
5 for you, okay?

414
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:23,776
有一天紅毛的朋友跑來
One day a buddy of Carrot's
showed up.

415
00:38:23,978 --> 00:38:30,100
他叫亞裡斯多德
我老婆要開刀
-His name was Aristotle.
-My wife needs an operation.

416
00:38:30,118 --> 00:38:36,455
他們家在紅毛落魄時收留他
His family had taken Carrot in
when he was down and out.

417
00:38:36,658 --> 00:38:39,422
兄弟有難，他不能不幫
He couldn't refuse to help
a brother in need.

418
00:38:39,627 --> 00:38:44,064
這是貨，週五之前交錢
Here’s the dope. I want
the dough no later than Friday.

419
00:38:44,265 --> 00:38:47,098
-你救了我一命 -星期五
-You’ve bailed me out, brother.
-Friday.

420
00:38:47,702 --> 00:38:51,536
他就像我的親兄弟
He’s my buddy, practically
my brother, Big Boy.

421
00:38:51,739 --> 00:38:55,732
再給他一星期
Give him another week.

422
00:38:57,946 --> 00:39:02,797
你不殺他，我就殺你
紅毛別無選擇
-Either you kill him, or I'll kill you.
-Carrot had no choice.

423
00:39:04,152 --> 00:39:08,680
-別這樣，別開槍
-我說星期五
-I said Friday.
-Don’t do it, man.

424
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:12,485
紅毛想殺了大個兒，不過不必
Carrot wanted to kill Big Boy,
but it wasn't necessary.

425
00:39:12,927 --> 00:39:17,217
大個兒沒收買條子，死在獄中
Big Boy hadn't paid off the cops.
He died in jail.

426
00:39:20,168 --> 00:39:23,695
紅毛接收了大個兒的一切
Carrot took everything
that belonged to Big Boy...

427
00:39:23,905 --> 00:39:27,707
但房子他不要
but didn’t want the apartment...

428
00:39:27,742 --> 00:39:33,403
他把它送給親信珨黑仔
the place was ill-fated. Carrot gave it
to his most trusted dealer...

429
00:39:31,813 --> 00:39:34,684
給你，150袋
-Here. 150 bags.
-Blacky.

430
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:36,876
多給一點，這裡很競爭
Give me more. This place
is crawling with druggies.

431
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:40,350
於是他接收了這個地盤
That's how he took over
the local trade.

432
00:39:40,555 --> 00:39:43,575
但為時並不久
But not for long...

433
00:39:44,025 --> 00:39:46,289
誰？是誰？
Who is it?

434
00:39:46,494 --> 00:39:48,359
去看看
Go see.

435
00:39:59,307 --> 00:40:01,298
-黑仔 -靠，小豆子
-Hey, Blacky.
-Fuck, Li’l Dice.

436
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:05,550
來我這裡還帶人
誰說這裡是你的？
-You show up like this at my place?
-Who said it was your place?

437
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,447
是啊，誰說的？
Yeah, who?

438
00:40:13,655 --> 00:40:15,555
小豆子，怎麼了？
-Something wrong, Li’l Dice?
-Li’l Dice, my ass.

439
00:40:15,757 --> 00:40:18,021
什麼小豆子，我現在叫小霸王
My name is Li’l Z’ now.

440
00:40:18,226 --> 00:40:20,626
（小霸王的故事）
THE STORY OF LI’L Z’

441
00:40:20,828 --> 00:40:23,854
小霸王從還叫小豆子的時候
Li’l Z' had always wanted
to be boss of the City of God...

442
00:40:24,065 --> 00:40:28,399
就想當天主之城的龍頭
ever since he was little
and was called "Li’l Dice".

443
00:40:32,206 --> 00:40:35,826
不讓我過癮？
They’re having fun,
and not me?

444
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,550
我想趕快走
I want to get out of here.

445
00:40:48,356 --> 00:40:52,617
幹什麼？你朋友搶過了
你還想怎樣？
What, kid? Your friend took
everything. What do you want?

446
00:40:58,566 --> 00:41:01,831
那一晚，小豆子如願殺了人
That night, Li'l Dice
satisfied his thirst to kill...

447
00:41:02,036 --> 00:41:04,561
他知道阿毛不會放過他
though he knew Shaggy would
never forgive him.

448
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:16,246
他離開天主之城躲避懲罰
To avoid being punished
he left the City of God.

449
00:41:17,452 --> 00:41:20,182
辛苦工作賺錢
He had to work hard for peanuts.

450
00:41:25,293 --> 00:41:29,077
-小豆子和班尼混得不錯
-幹得好
-Yeah, Benny!
-Li’l Dice and Benny managed well.

451
00:41:30,498 --> 00:41:32,261
他們有犯罪天份
They had the gift of crime.

452
00:41:32,467 --> 00:41:35,471
-你拿得比我多 -我是主謀
-You have more money than me.
-It was my idea.

453
00:41:35,506 --> 00:41:38,599
他們只怕遇見大流氓
The only problem was running into
an older hoodlum...

454
00:41:38,806 --> 00:41:42,144
像我哥阿呆
小豆子？
...like my brother, Goose.
-Li’l Dice?

455
00:41:42,243 --> 00:41:45,576
媽的，我以為你掛了
Shit, man. I thought
you were a goner at the motel.

456
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,476
你好有錢
You’re fucking loaded!

457
00:41:48,683 --> 00:41:52,346
別給他，那是我們的
Don’t, Benny. That’s our money.

458
00:41:52,887 --> 00:41:55,656
去你的，少廢話
Benny, tell your brother Shaggy...

459
00:41:55,691 --> 00:42:03,086
班尼，告訴阿毛矮子告密了
我要離開這裡
I’m leaving the ghetto.
that Shorty is squealing.

460
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:06,032
阿呆
Goose!

461
00:42:06,301 --> 00:42:11,898
這是阿毛的，帶著吧
From Shaggy. You'll need it.

462
00:42:31,926 --> 00:42:34,554
小豆子在殺人的日子裡長大
From one hit to the next,
Li’l Dice grew up.

463
00:42:34,762 --> 00:42:39,165
18歲就成了最受敬畏的兄弟
At 18, he was the most
respected hood in the City of God.

464
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:41,426
你成年了，小心
You’re of age now, watch out!

465
00:42:41,636 --> 00:42:44,935
和里約熱內盧頭號通緝犯之一
He was one of the most
wanted robbers in Rio.

466
00:42:58,219 --> 00:42:59,880
小豆子，你好嗎？
Li’l Dice, how’s it going?

467
00:43:00,088 --> 00:43:03,717
生日快樂，恭喜你成年
Happy birthday.
I’m so glad you’ve turned 18...

468
00:43:03,925 --> 00:43:07,156
滾開啦
抱歉
-Get lost, Tuba!
-Excuse me, amigo...

469
00:43:07,795 --> 00:43:09,862
我要啤酒
Give me a beer!

470
00:43:10,064 --> 00:43:11,663
混蛋，你沒看到我嗎？
Didn’t you see me, prick?

471
00:43:11,698 --> 00:43:15,766
-你沒看到我嗎？ -怎麼啦？
-Sorry, man.
-Up yours!

472
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:19,337
去你的 下次一定宰了你，娘娘腔
The next time,
I’ll waste you, asshole!

473
00:43:20,742 --> 00:43:22,767
Fag!

474
00:43:23,111 --> 00:43:26,046
小豆子野心勃勃
Li'l Dice was ready for anything.

475
00:43:26,247 --> 00:43:28,181
我有話要說
I wanna talk.

476
00:43:28,382 --> 00:43:31,900
他急欲大展身手
那幾隻羊最肥？
-And he was itching to start.
-Who are the fattest cats here?

477
00:43:31,935 --> 00:43:36,051
一大堆
你看傑瑞
-There are tons of them.
-Look at Jerry Adriani...

478
00:43:36,257 --> 00:43:40,353
金鏈子，漂亮衣服
gold chain, snazzy clothes.

479
00:43:40,561 --> 00:43:42,756
你看佩拉和他的妞
Look at Pereira
and the chick he’s with...

480
00:43:42,964 --> 00:43:47,360
貝妮絲，她跟過我哥
你看他的車
-Bernice. She was my brother’s girl.
-Check out his car.

481
00:43:47,435 --> 00:43:51,565
還有黑仔，金光閃閃
Then there’s Blacky.
Covered in gold.

482
00:43:51,773 --> 00:43:54,435
金項鍊，金手錶
Gold chain, gold watch...

483
00:43:54,642 --> 00:43:57,805
你看紅毛和他的車
Look at Carrot, and his car.

484
00:43:58,012 --> 00:44:01,783
-他們都是毒販
-他們都很有錢
-They’re all dealers.
-They’re all fucking loaded.

485
00:44:01,949 --> 00:44:03,974
搶劫錢太少
Hold-ups bring in chickenshit.

486
00:44:04,185 --> 00:44:06,983
-毒品才有賺頭 -我懂了
-The big bucks are in drugs.
-I see.

487
00:44:07,188 --> 00:44:09,421
尤其是賣白粉
Especially in selling coke.

488
00:44:09,456 --> 00:44:11,654
-要有本錢 -不必
-But you need money.
-Not really...

489
00:44:11,859 --> 00:44:15,556
直接殺了他們接手
We’ll kill these clowns
and take over their business.

490
00:44:15,763 --> 00:44:18,527
-什麼時候開始？ -馬上
-When do we start?
-Now.

491
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:32,001
惡魔指點明路
Exu-the-Devil is the light
that shines forth.

492
00:44:32,213 --> 00:44:34,807
把你帶來
He brought you here.

493
00:44:35,016 --> 00:44:40,215
為何留在天主遺忘的天主之城
Why remain in the City of God
where God has forgotten you?

494
00:44:41,088 --> 00:44:45,491
我知道你要什麼
你要權柄
I know what you want.
You want power.

495
00:44:45,693 --> 00:44:49,823
我有東西可以讓你如願
I have something which will
give it to you.

496
00:44:51,365 --> 00:44:55,859
我把護身符送給你改運
To change your fate,
I give you my protector, boy.

497
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:59,665
但你不能褻瀆它
But you mustn't fornicate
with the amulet...

498
00:44:59,874 --> 00:45:05,811
否則你會死
you’ll die.
otherwise...

499
00:45:06,314 --> 00:45:10,907
你不再是小豆子，而是小霸王
Li’l Dice...
but Li’l Z’.
The boy is no longer called

500
00:45:11,118 --> 00:45:14,679
小霸王會長大
Li’l Z’ will grow up.

501
00:45:14,989 --> 00:45:18,789
你追隨我，我就挺你
You stick with me,
I’ll stick with you.

502
00:45:30,071 --> 00:45:33,529
小豆子改名小霸王，大開殺戒
Li’l Dice became Li'l Z'
and he began to kill.

503
00:45:33,972 --> 00:45:42,000
他找一天拿傑瑞開刀
他整天都在幹這種事
He started one morning,
taking over Jerry Adriani's racket.

504
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:46,819
到了晚上 他幾乎併吞了全城的生意
By that night, almost all
of the rackets in the ghetto were his.

505
00:45:47,021 --> 00:45:50,422
紅毛是班尼的朋友，逃過一劫
The only business he didn't
touch was Carrot's...

506
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:56,640
剩下這層公寓，不過好辦
since he was a friend of Benny's.
All that was left was the apartment...
But that would be easy.

507
00:46:00,635 --> 00:46:03,695
誰？是誰？
Who is it?

508
00:46:10,444 --> 00:46:12,309
-黑仔 -靠，小豆子
-Hey, Blacky.
-Fuck, Li’l Dice.

509
00:46:12,513 --> 00:46:18,645
來我這裡還帶人
誰說這裡是你的？
-You show up like this at my place?
-Who said it was your place?

510
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,993
小豆子，怎麼了？
-Something wrong, Li’l Dice?
-Li’l Dice, my ass.

511
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:24,146
-什麼小豆子，我現在叫小霸王
-他叫小霸王
-My name is Li’l Z’ now.
-His name’s Li’l Z’, see?

512
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:27,486
-你完蛋了 -別殺他，他懂
-You’re a goner, bastard.
-Don’t kill him. He understands.

513
00:46:27,695 --> 00:46:29,822
對吧？
Right, Blacky?

514
00:46:30,031 --> 00:46:33,964
什麼都給你 我不想惹麻煩
It’s all yours, I don’t want anything.
I don’t want no trouble, okay?

515
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:37,897
我應該趁機替我哥報仇
I should have taken this chance
to avenge my brother's death.

516
00:46:39,774 --> 00:46:44,631
饒你一命替我們工作 懂嗎？
You’ll live, but you’ll
work for us. Understand?

517
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:46,772
但說得容易
That's easy to say...

518
00:46:48,115 --> 00:46:51,312
-你要去哪裡？ -不關他的事
-Where are you going?
-He’s clean, Li’l Z’.

519
00:46:51,886 --> 00:46:53,319
你叫什麼？
What’s your name, kid?

520
00:46:53,521 --> 00:46:57,321
-阿炮 -他是阿呆的弟弟
-Rocket.
-He’s Goose’s brother.

521
00:46:57,525 --> 00:47:00,119
-阿呆？ -死掉的阿呆
-Goose?
-The late Goose.

522
00:47:01,329 --> 00:47:03,593
你走吧
Quick, kid. Run along.

523
00:47:03,798 --> 00:47:08,258
告訴大家現在由我當家
Tell everyone that this business
now belongs to Li’l Z’.

524
00:47:08,469 --> 00:47:12,371
我們會賣白粉，懂嗎？
And that we'll be selling coke.
Got that?

525
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,469
古柯鹼
Cocaine.

526
00:47:17,478 --> 00:47:20,413
-堂口在哪裡？ -往前左邊
-Where’s the turf?
-Over there, on the left.

527
00:47:20,614 --> 00:47:23,640
販毒就像其他生意
Selling drugs is like any
other business.

528
00:47:23,985 --> 00:47:25,885
供應商提供貨品，在裝配線上
The supplier
delivers the merchandise...

529
00:47:26,087 --> 00:47:28,817
which is then
packaged on the premises.

530
00:47:29,156 --> 00:47:32,956
進行包裝
It's done in an assembly line.

531
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:39,723
說來枯燥，大麻卷成一卷
Boring as hell...
Pot is wrapped up in "lids".

532
00:47:40,001 --> 00:47:42,697
古柯鹼則裝成小包
Cocaine is put into packets...

533
00:47:43,437 --> 00:47:47,669
十包或百包為一袋
and then into bundles
of 10 or 100.

534
00:47:48,042 --> 00:47:50,909
販毒甚至可以當事業
You can even make a career
in dealing drugs.

535
00:47:51,112 --> 00:47:54,946
先當小弟
The kids start out
as delivery boys.

536
00:47:55,216 --> 00:47:59,209
拿錢負責跑腿，或是傳話
They're paid to run errands
and take messages.

537
00:47:59,954 --> 00:48:01,846
然後升格把風
Then they become lookouts.
If the police arrive...

538
00:48:01,881 --> 00:48:06,750
員警一來，就收風箏大家閃人
the kites disappear
and everyone scrams.

539
00:48:07,261 --> 00:48:10,856
之後變成毒販或※幽靈§
Later, you become a dealer
or a "vapor".

540
00:48:11,065 --> 00:48:14,159
員警一來，幽靈就會消失
When the heat's on, the
"vapor" quickly evaporates.

541
00:48:14,368 --> 00:48:18,498
再往上有打手
Moving up the ladder,
you have the "soldier".

542
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:22,334
算術好的可以當經理
And if the guy is good at math,
he can become a manager...

543
00:48:22,543 --> 00:48:26,001
是老大的左右手
the boss' right-hand man.

544
00:48:27,448 --> 00:48:31,384
員警拿了甜頭，不會找碴
The police receive their part
and don’t make trouble.

545
00:48:33,587 --> 00:48:36,181
小霸王殺光了對頭
Since Li’l Z' killed off
all of his enemies...

546
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:41,350
天主之城不再有槍戰
可以安心開車
there were no shoot-outs in the
City of God. You could drive there...

547
00:48:41,729 --> 00:48:45,256
大家覺得在這裡交易很安全
The playboys felt safe
buying their drugs there.

548
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:51,364
毒蟲湧入，小霸王大發利市
The City teemed with addicts
and Li’l Z' grew rich.

549
00:48:52,306 --> 00:48:54,604
-這樣夠嗎？ -成交
-Is it okay?
-It’s a deal.

550
00:48:58,279 --> 00:49:02,727
-我不知道該戴哪一支
-這支很酷
-I can’t decide which to wear.
-This one’s cool.

551
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:07,519
若販毒合法，小霸王早就紅了
If dealing were legal, Li’l Z'
would have been man of the year.

552
00:49:08,426 --> 00:49:13,726
但我就危險了，我很怕他
But things were risky for me.
I was afraid of him.

553
00:49:13,311 --> 00:49:18,126
卻處處碰到他
煩死了
-And he was everywhere.
-What a drag this guy is.

554
00:49:18,332 --> 00:49:23,463
每次想哈麻，我就得去找紅毛
Whenever I wanted to smoke a joint
I had to go see Carrot.

555
00:49:28,075 --> 00:49:31,653
半卷
謝了
Half a lid. Thanks.

556
00:49:32,113 --> 00:49:36,277
但是值得，我只跟安潔莉卡抽
But it was worth it.
I only smoked with Angelica.

557
00:49:37,952 --> 00:49:40,819
她剛分手，我展開行動
She and Thiago had split up,
so I made my move.

558
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:46,823
我就快追到她了
照得真好
-I was about to win her over...
-These pictures are really great.

559
00:49:47,027 --> 00:49:50,729
是嗎？
我這張很好看
-You think so?
-I look good here.

560
00:49:50,831 --> 00:49:53,595
-你怎樣都漂亮 -我是說真的
-You look beautiful everywhere.
-I’m serious.

561
00:49:53,801 --> 00:49:54,790
我也是
Me too.

562
00:49:57,705 --> 00:50:02,938
夕陽、無人的沙灘
長吻
A setting sun,
a deserted beach... a long kiss...

563
00:50:03,144 --> 00:50:05,977
我心想終於要來了
I was sure this was it...

564
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,171
結果來的是小鬼頭
But the Runts arrived.

565
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:13,015
可以給我一根嗎？
Can I have a toke?

566
00:50:18,592 --> 00:50:19,786
拿去
Here.

567
00:50:19,994 --> 00:50:24,192
我要走了，再見
I’m going. See you later.

568
00:50:26,066 --> 00:50:29,365
安潔莉卡
Hold on, Angelica.

569
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:32,061
-你的大麻 -給你
-Your joint, man.
-Keep it.

570
00:50:32,273 --> 00:50:34,605
好酷的人
What a cool guy.

571
00:50:37,578 --> 00:50:41,947
那是我與小鬼頭首次接觸
That was my first run
in with the Runts.

572
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:51,451
班尼，牛排和薯條
太好了
-Steak and fries, Benny.
-Great! Here...

573
00:50:54,394 --> 00:51:01,047
來
你的小費
真的？謝謝
-A tip for you.
-Really? Thanks.

574
00:51:00,533 --> 00:51:03,569
-你要吃嗎？ -不要
-Wanna eat something?
-No.

575
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:10,237
可以拿表換嗎？
失去安潔莉卡後
-Wanna trade this watch?
-After Angelica left him...

576
00:51:10,443 --> 00:51:12,343
提亞哥越陷越深
Thiago began snorting
more and more.

577
00:51:12,545 --> 00:51:15,639
-你爺爺的？ -我爸的
-Is it your grandfather’s?
-No, my dad’s.

578
00:51:15,848 --> 00:51:20,148
人一上癮就會受毒販控制
When a guy is really hooked
he ends up in the hands of the dealer.

579
00:51:20,353 --> 00:51:22,480
-十包的兩袋 -一袋
-Two bags of ten.
-One of ten.

580
00:51:22,689 --> 00:51:26,965
好
但是提亞哥不同
-Okay, one bag.
-For Thiago, it was different.

581
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,415
小心
抱歉，教父
-Watch out!
-Sorry, godfather.

582
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:33,830
我有幫你孩子施洗嗎？
Godfather, my ass.
Did I baptize your kids?

583
00:51:33,866 --> 00:51:37,559
很抱歉
快滾
-I’m sorry.
-Now beat it.

584
00:51:39,505 --> 00:51:43,498
黑仔，腳踏車借我
Blacky, lend me your bike.

585
00:52:06,966 --> 00:52:09,230
要比賽嗎？
Hey, wanna race?

586
00:52:09,435 --> 00:52:13,020
到哪裡？
高速公路
-Where to?
-Up to the highway.

587
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:16,441
-好了嗎？ -開始
-Okay.
-Ready? Go!

588
00:52:38,831 --> 00:52:42,665
-很難吧？
-是啊，你好強
-Pretty tough, wasn’t it?
-Yeah, you’re good.

589
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:45,201
球鞋在哪裡買的？
Where’d you buy those sneakers?

590
00:52:45,404 --> 00:52:47,998
-不是這裡 -衣服也不是？
-Not far from here.
-The shirt, as well?

591
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:50,539
-去住宅區買的 -酷
-No, uptown.
-Cool.

592
00:52:50,743 --> 00:52:52,973
是名牌
It’s a designer shirt.

593
00:52:53,179 --> 00:52:55,511
你可以幫我買嗎？
If I give you money
can you buy me one?

594
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:58,377
買短褲和衣服？
Shorts and a shirt?

595
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,918
都買
Buy whatever you can.

596
00:53:05,591 --> 00:53:07,650
-你穿幾號？ -來量吧
-What size are you?
-Measure me.

597
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,795
-用什麼量？ -手啊
-With what, man?
-Shit, with your hand.

598
00:53:12,298 --> 00:53:16,130
鞋子呢？
轉過去
Shoe size? Turn around.

599
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:28,985
班尼
你找到房子了？
-Hey, Benny!
-You got the digs?

600
00:53:31,784 --> 00:53:36,320
-褲子只有一條？ -還有
-Just one pair of pants?
-No, there’s more.

601
00:53:40,193 --> 00:53:41,455
-喜歡嗎？ -喜歡
-You like it?
-Yeah.

602
00:53:42,728 --> 00:53:49,486
錢還有剩
There’s some change.
留著吧
酷
-Keep it.
-Cool.

603
00:53:57,076 --> 00:53:59,709
這是班尼
This is Benny.

604
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:04,375
-這是阿炮 -我知道
-This is Rocket.
-Hi. I know him.

605
00:54:28,841 --> 00:54:31,503
我很時髦吧
I’ve become a playboy.

606
00:54:33,446 --> 00:54:37,576
兄弟們，聽我說
Hey, gangsters, listen to this...

607
00:54:37,783 --> 00:54:39,614
小心一點
Watch out...

608
00:54:39,819 --> 00:54:43,482
爵士迷拉屎前會搖屁股
Groovies shake their asses
before laying a big one.

609
00:54:46,959 --> 00:54:49,159
是嗎？
Oh, yeah?

610
00:54:49,562 --> 00:54:52,258
Fuck off, you bastards!

611
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:59,729
給我滾
敢笑我？
Making fun of me?

612
00:54:59,764 --> 00:55:01,867
混蛋
Asshole!

613
00:55:16,789 --> 00:55:20,754
我不是叫你殺紅毛？他在危害貧民區
Benny, didn’t I tell you to shoot Carrot?
He’s endangering the ghetto.

614
00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:24,720
-別激動，去找他談 -我要宰了他
-Cool it. Go talk to him.
-I’m gonna kill that fucker.

615
00:55:24,931 --> 00:55:28,071
-我要殺了他
-別老是想殺人
-Stop trying to wipe out everyone.
-I’m gonna kill him.

616
00:55:30,136 --> 00:55:33,128
放心，這裡的人都很好
Don’t worry, Angelica.
The guys in here are cool.

617
00:55:33,339 --> 00:55:35,933
我又不擔心
Sure, I’m not worried.

618
00:55:36,409 --> 00:55:41,135
你要跳舞？那紅毛呢？
You gonna dance, Benny?
What about Carrot?

619
00:55:40,446 --> 00:55:44,507
你去找他談嘛
Go on, buddy. Go talk to the guy.

620
00:55:44,717 --> 00:55:48,278
班尼是天主之城最好的流氓
Benny was the coolest hood
in the City of God.

621
00:55:48,487 --> 00:55:51,650
送大麻，請喝酒
He gave away pot,
paid for drinks.

622
00:55:52,158 --> 00:55:55,252
小霸王則相反
Li’l Z' was the opposite.
He had one obsession:

623
00:55:55,461 --> 00:55:57,429
他一心只想當老大
to be the boss of the ghetto.

624
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:00,895
他想設法接收紅毛的生意
He wanted an excuse to take over
Carrot's racket.

625
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,727
-紅毛 -怎樣？
-Hey, Carrot.
-What’s up?

626
00:56:02,935 --> 00:56:07,235
你不該放任小鬼頭搶劫
You shouldn’t let the Runts
do hold-ups in the ghetto.

627
00:56:07,807 --> 00:56:10,605
大家管好各自的地盤，好嗎？
You look after your section,
I’ll look after mine.

628
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:15,580
我要去喝酒
Got that? I'm gonna get a drink.

629
00:56:22,555 --> 00:56:27,458
-阿炮，你好嗎？ -很好
-Hey, Rocket! How’s it going?
-Great.

630
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:30,720
-班尼 -你好嗎？
-Hey, Benny!
-How’s it going?

631
00:56:31,497 --> 00:56:34,466
-你好嗎？ -還不錯
-Hey, Thiago. How are you?
-Good.

632
00:56:35,534 --> 00:56:37,001
-可以嗎？ -當然
-May I?
-Sure...

633
00:56:37,203 --> 00:56:39,501
要跳舞嗎？
Wanna dance?

634
00:56:43,009 --> 00:56:46,467
去你家行嗎？
沒問題
-Is it okay at your place?
-No problem.

635
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:51,087
我爸媽出去了，你們孤男寡女
My parents are out.
You’ll be all alone with her.

636
00:56:50,549 --> 00:56:55,496
你可以開炮了
小聲一點
-You can lose your virginity tonight.
-Not so loud, man!

637
00:56:55,531 --> 00:56:57,671
別人會聽見
Everyone will hear.

638
00:56:58,124 --> 00:57:00,524
-你好漂亮 -謝謝
-You’re beautiful.
-Thank you.

639
00:57:00,726 --> 00:57:05,186
-沒事啦
-媽的
-Shit!
-Nothing’s happening.

640
00:57:12,405 --> 00:57:18,800
我知道小鬼頭跟你有關係
你當我是白癡？
Look, man, I know the Runts
are associated with you.

641
00:57:16,909 --> 00:57:20,738
你想搶生意？
Think I'm a sucker, you little brat?
You want to take my racket?

642
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:24,978
我想說清楚，因為你是廢物
I want to talk to you
because you’re fucking useless.

643
00:57:25,184 --> 00:57:26,173
不要碰我
Get your hand away!

644
00:57:26,385 --> 00:57:29,411
小鬼頭在破壞秩序
The Runts are screwing up
our security, man.

645
00:57:29,622 --> 00:57:30,953
快幫他餵奶
Give the baby his bottle.

646
00:57:31,157 --> 00:57:33,724
叫那些孩子住手
Carrot, just ask the kids
to cool it, okay?

647
00:57:33,759 --> 00:57:37,160
紅毛沒用，任憑小鬼頭搶劫
Carrot’s useless. He lets the Runts
do hold-ups in his section.

648
00:57:37,363 --> 00:57:40,298
員警來會影響生意
The police come around and
that’s bad for business.

649
00:57:40,566 --> 00:57:44,176
我就看
你的面子
I’ll do it only because
I like you.

650
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:47,786
你快去幫寶寶換尿布
But you need to change
that baby's diapers.

651
00:57:46,372 --> 00:57:50,374
I’ll show you who’s the baby...
你才是寶寶

652
00:57:50,409 --> 00:57:56,013
叫他們別在這裡搶劫強暴
Tell the kids that in my ghetto
no one robs or rapes!

653
00:57:56,115 --> 00:57:57,582
難怪你是※小§霸王
No wonder you’re "Little" Z’!

654
00:58:00,753 --> 00:58:05,690
小鬼頭是一群無法無天的小孩
The Runts were kids who didn't
respect the laws of the ghetto.

655
00:58:05,891 --> 00:58:09,349
他們搶住家，搶麵包店
They would mug residents,
hold up bakeries...

656
00:58:09,562 --> 00:58:11,757
在紅毛那裡特別囂張
especially in Carrot's section.

657
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:18,261
你們幹什麼？
What are you doing?

658
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:21,762
老是來搶我
-You rob me all the time!
-But they didn't know...

659
00:58:21,797 --> 00:58:27,099
他們不知道現在這裡有老大了
that the City had a boss now.

660
00:58:28,948 --> 00:58:30,973
（謝謝惠顧）
THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING US

661
00:58:31,183 --> 00:58:35,017
天主之城對居民來說變安全了
The City had become
much safer for residents.

662
00:58:36,355 --> 00:58:39,222
現在幾乎沒有搶劫
There were hardly
any hold-ups now.

663
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:40,755
有事就找小霸王
You just had to go see Li’l Z'.

664
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,673
-走吧 -別傷害那些小鬼
-Let’s go.
-Don’t hurt the Runts.

665
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:47,197
我不會碰他們
I won’t touch them.

666
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:52,838
-牛排 -小霸王
-Hi, Steak.
-How’s it going, Li’l Z’?

667
00:58:53,038 --> 00:58:55,734
-要不要去走走？ -跟你去？
-Wanna take a walk, Steak?
-With you? Hold on...

668
00:58:58,177 --> 00:59:01,169
媽，我跟朋友出去
Mom, I’m going out with
my friends.

669
00:59:13,626 --> 00:59:16,288
真好吃的雞
That’s the best chicken
I ever ate.

670
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:21,373
那個老頭嚇死了
你替他難過？
-The old guy was scared shitless.
-Feeling sorry for him?

671
00:59:21,408 --> 00:59:24,059
怎麼可能
You’re crazy, man!

672
00:59:32,478 --> 00:59:35,345
乾脆去搶銀行或超市
Why not stick up
a bank or a supermarket?

673
00:59:35,548 --> 00:59:39,985
-太遜了，毒品才好賺
-沒錯，販毒
-Peanuts. Drugs are where it’s at.
-Yeah, selling drugs.

674
00:59:40,186 --> 00:59:46,489
但得從小弟做起
你要嗎？
But you have to start out as a delivery
boy. You wanna be a delivery boy?

675
00:59:46,692 --> 00:59:51,925
真剝削，熬好久才能爬上去
It’s a rip off.
It takes a long time to move up.

676
00:59:52,231 --> 00:59:56,102
老鳥死了才能往上爬
You have to wait till an older guy
gets killed to move up.

677
00:59:56,137 --> 01:00:02,868
我不想等
我要學小霸王，把他們幹掉
croaks. I'm gonna do what Li’l Z' did.
I don't wanna wait till some guy
I'm gonna wipe them all out.

678
01:00:03,075 --> 01:00:05,908
在講我嗎？老大我來了
Talking about me, kid?
The boss is here.

679
01:00:10,015 --> 01:00:11,573
小鬼，回來
Come back, you brat!

680
01:00:15,955 --> 01:00:21,728
-動作真快
-真會跑
-They’re quick, those kids.
-They run fast.

681
01:00:21,763 --> 01:00:27,501
別的都跑了 還有嗎？
They’re all gone except you.
Any others?

682
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:37,002
你們得替他們付出代價
You’re gonna pay
for the ones that escaped.

683
01:00:37,209 --> 01:00:41,373
自己選，要射手還是腳？
You choose. Shall I shoot you
in the hand or foot?

684
01:00:41,981 --> 01:00:43,881
快選
Come on, choose!

685
01:00:44,083 --> 01:00:47,331
手還是腳？
Hand or foot?

686
01:00:49,388 --> 01:00:52,118
趕快選，快選啊
Choose, for fuck's sake!

687
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:02,993
-手 -你選小手？
-Hand.
-The little hand, eh?

688
01:01:10,981 --> 01:01:13,970
酷斃了
Cool.

689
01:01:13,992 --> 01:01:19,650
牛排，來看看你的能耐
Hey, Steak’n’fries,
let’s see what you’re made of.

690
01:01:19,685 --> 01:01:23,185
殺了其中一個
Choose and then kill
one of them.

691
01:01:23,389 --> 01:01:27,476
-滾開，讓他來
-算了，讓我來
-Leave it. I’ll do it.
-Butt out, Tuba. This is for him.

692
01:01:30,029 --> 01:01:31,860
快點
Go on, Steak.

693
01:01:32,064 --> 01:01:35,500
選一個，然後開槍
Go on, choose one and shoot.

694
01:01:35,701 --> 01:01:38,727
快點，我沒時間等你
Come on, I haven’t got all day.

695
01:01:38,937 --> 01:01:43,461
快啊
看你要殺哪一個
Kill one of them.

696
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:48,104
快，我的時間有限
Let’s go, Steak.
I’m in a hurry.

697
01:01:48,314 --> 01:01:51,681
我想看你有沒有種
I wanna see what you’re made of.

698
01:01:53,762 --> 01:01:56,663
殺了其中一個

699
01:01:56,893 --> 01:01:59,259
快點，我趕時間

700
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:04,395
很好，你辦到了
Well done!
You did it.

701
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:12,577
-你也是兄弟了
-很好，牛排
-You’re one of us. Give me five.
-Very good, Steak.

702
01:02:12,805 --> 01:02:19,810
起來，回你的老鼠洞去
不准跛腳
Get up, brat. Go back
to your rat hole. Without limping!

703
01:02:20,312 --> 01:02:24,612
叫其他人不准在我的地方搶劫
Tell your buddies that no one
robs in Li’l Z”s ghetto.

704
01:02:24,817 --> 01:02:27,581
快去，不准跛腳
Go now.
And no limping, okay?

705
01:02:29,888 --> 01:02:32,118
Cool, Li’l Z'.

706
01:02:44,703 --> 01:02:48,366
小霸王贏得居民的尊敬
While Li’l Z' was winning
the respect of the residents...

707
01:02:48,841 --> 01:02:51,810
班尼則贏得安潔莉卡的心
Benny was winning
Angelica's heart.

708
01:02:52,344 --> 01:02:56,974
而我，仍是個窮光蛋處男
As for me, I was still
a virgin, single and broke.

709
01:02:57,182 --> 01:02:59,446
我別無選擇
I had no choice.

710
01:03:00,552 --> 01:03:03,487
（一個俗辣的人生）
SUCKER’S LIFE

711
01:03:03,689 --> 01:03:07,420
我必須去超市上班
I had to take a job
in a supermarket.

712
01:03:07,626 --> 01:03:12,154
工時長，薪水少
我巴不得被解雇
I worked long hours for chicken feed.
I wanted to be laid off...

713
01:03:12,364 --> 01:03:16,391
好用遣散費買一台相機
so I could buy a camera
with the severance pay.

714
01:03:17,603 --> 01:03:20,731
但我想得太美了
But things didn't
work out that way.

715
01:03:23,809 --> 01:03:26,471
-是海邊那個人 -老兄
-It’s the guy on the beach.
-Hey, bro!

716
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:29,374
-還在抽好貨？ -是啊
-Still smoking good stuff?
-Yeah.

717
01:03:29,581 --> 01:03:31,242
這傢伙太酷了
That guy’s too cool.

718
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:34,010
小朋友，衣服拉起來
Hey, kid. Come here.
Lift up your shirt.

719
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:42,391
這些貧民窟小孩，給臉不要臉
We give these ghetto kids a chance
and they don't appreciate it.

720
01:03:42,594 --> 01:03:46,086
-那遣散費呢？ -什麼遣散費？
-What about my severance pay?
-What severance pay?

721
01:03:46,298 --> 01:03:50,257
經理以為我跟他們是一夥的
That fucking manager thought
I was part of the gang.

722
01:03:50,469 --> 01:03:55,634
你因嚴重失職被解雇 馬上給我滾
You’re fired for serious misconduct.
Get out. Immediately!

723
01:03:55,841 --> 01:03:59,299
我一分錢也沒拿到
I didn’t get a single cent.

724
01:04:13,091 --> 01:04:15,252
這仿佛一道神諭
It was like a message from God:

725
01:04:17,563 --> 01:04:21,397
※蠢材，誠實沒有好下場§
"Honesty doesn't pay, sucker’."

726
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,865
（意圖犯罪）
FLIRTING WITH CRIME

727
01:04:34,046 --> 01:04:38,352
我等了好久
上班都遲到了
The bus sure took a long time to come.
I should already be at work.

728
01:04:38,584 --> 01:04:41,985
把槍藏好，你瘋啦？
Shit, hide that gun.
Are you nuts?

729
01:04:42,187 --> 01:04:43,848
這是阿呆的，反正壞了
It was Goose’s.
It’s broken anyway.

730
01:04:44,056 --> 01:04:47,324
是這個路線的班次少
It’s not our fault, the company
runs few buses on this line.

731
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:51,955
誰都沒有錯，都是別人的錯
It’s never anyone’s fault.
It’s always someone else’s.

732
01:04:52,164 --> 01:04:56,123
苦的是勞工，還要被壓榨
But it’s the workers who suffer.
And then, they make us squeeze!

733
01:04:56,335 --> 01:04:58,462
祝您晚安
Have a nice evening, ma'am.

734
01:05:00,973 --> 01:05:03,339
我認識他，他也住天主之城
I know that guy.

735
01:05:03,542 --> 01:05:05,809
會認出我們
He lives in the City.
He’ll recognize us.

736
01:05:05,844 --> 01:05:08,438
他才不會在乎老闆的錢被搶
So? He couldn’t care less
if we take his boss’ money.

737
01:05:08,647 --> 01:05:11,161
好，走吧
Okay. Let’s go.

738
01:05:13,819 --> 01:05:17,277
你們不是住天主之城？
Well, boys? Aren’t you from
the City of God?

739
01:05:17,723 --> 01:05:19,020
是啊
Yeah.

740
01:05:19,224 --> 01:05:22,387
我讓你們一個人免費
I’ll let one of you through
without paying.

741
01:05:26,665 --> 01:05:30,795
你們要念書，才能離開貧民區
You should study
so you can get out of the ghetto.

742
01:05:31,003 --> 01:05:33,870
那裡條子和流氓太多了
It's too full of cops and
hoodlums.

743
01:05:34,072 --> 01:05:37,940
你念過書嗎？
我上過學，當過兵
-Did you study?
-I was in school and in the army.

744
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:41,306
是營上的第一神射
I was the best marksman
in my barracks.

745
01:05:41,513 --> 01:05:44,038
我只找得到這份工作
This job was all
I could find afterwards.

746
01:05:44,249 --> 01:05:48,447
但我在練空手道，有別的工作
But I do karate.
If I’m hired somewhere...

747
01:05:48,654 --> 01:05:50,747
我就離開貧民窟
I’ll leave the ghetto.

748
01:05:51,256 --> 01:05:55,787
-我愛好愛與和平
-你打不打架？
-Do you fight, then?
-I’m for peace and love.

749
01:05:56,094 --> 01:05:57,561
但必要時…
But if I have to...

750
01:05:57,763 --> 01:06:00,017
會有那麼一天的
He didn't know he would have to.

751
01:06:00,052 --> 01:06:04,352
不過還沒輪到帥奈德的故事
But not yet, it's not time
to tell Knockout Ned's story.

752
01:06:04,903 --> 01:06:07,064
-我們該走了 -走吧
-We should be going.
-Let’s go.

753
01:06:07,272 --> 01:06:08,972
-再見 -謝了
-Good bye.
-Thanks.

754
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:09,971
拜拜
See you.

755
01:06:15,247 --> 01:06:17,977
我下不了手，他人很好
I couldn’t do it.
He was such a cool guy.

756
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:21,346
是啊，他是葛森的哥哥
Yeah, totally.
That’s Gerson’s brother.

757
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:24,552
回家吧
Let’s go home.

758
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:30,753
這裡只有那家麵包店
There’s nothing here
except that bakery over there.

759
01:06:30,963 --> 01:06:35,832
-不知道，※搶劫§吧
-要說什麼？
-What will you say?
-I don’t know. "This is a hold-up."

760
01:06:37,936 --> 01:06:39,528
這是我的電話
Here’s my number.

761
01:06:39,738 --> 01:06:41,933
-你喜歡靈魂還是爵士派對？ -靈魂派對
-You like soul or groovy parties?
-Soul.

762
01:06:42,307 --> 01:06:44,070
這個也沒成功
That one didn't work either.

763
01:06:44,276 --> 01:06:47,609
女店員好妖嬌，還跟我調情
The counter girl was just too foxy.
And she flirted with me.

764
01:06:47,813 --> 01:06:48,973
你會打給我嗎？
Will you call me?

765
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:54,249
我沒辦法對她掏槍，她好甜
I couldn’t pull a gun on her,
she was too sweet.

766
01:06:54,284 --> 01:06:56,093
我同意
Yeah, I agree.

767
01:06:58,363 --> 01:07:05,763
請問一下
我迷路了，巴哈怎麼走？
Excuse me. I’m lost.
How do I get to Barra?

768
01:07:05,964 --> 01:07:06,953
-巴哈？ -是啊
-To Barra?
-Yes.

769
01:07:07,165 --> 01:07:09,963
我心想，算這個聖保羅人衰
I thought: "Tough luck
for this guy from Sao Paulo."

770
01:07:10,168 --> 01:07:13,337
-這麼巧
-我們正要過去
-In fact, we were going there.
-You’re kidding.

771
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:17,775
-你救了我一命 -沒錯
-You’re a lifesaver.
-That’s right.

772
01:07:18,543 --> 01:07:21,944
因為聖保羅人都很爛
Because no guy from Sao Paulo
could ever be cool.

773
01:07:29,421 --> 01:07:31,867
屍體在這邊
-The body’s over here.
-We found it, Chief.

774
01:07:31,902 --> 01:07:35,349
警長，找到了
法醫先生
The forensic expert!

775
01:07:50,842 --> 01:07:52,935
長得不怎麼樣嘛
-Not a pretty sight, eh?
-You said it.

776
01:07:53,145 --> 01:07:55,612
-好棒的歌手 -你喜歡他？
-What a great singer.
-You like him?

777
01:07:55,647 --> 01:08:01,170
我喜歡音樂，你呢？
你也喜歡大麻嗎？
-I love music. What about you?
-Tell me, do you also like pot?

778
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:06,780
我不能說沒抽過
I can’t say I’ve never tried it.

779
01:08:06,992 --> 01:08:10,120
你自己找吧
The devil recognizes his own.

780
01:08:12,197 --> 01:08:14,965
有紙嗎？
-Do you have papers?
-I think so.

781
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,551
我用完了
我這裡有
I have some.

782
01:08:20,038 --> 01:08:22,802
我很會卷大麻
I’d always been an ace
at rolling a joint.

783
01:08:23,008 --> 01:08:25,408
要是泡妞也這麼行
If I’d had the same skill
with girls...

784
01:08:26,211 --> 01:08:30,375
就不會錯失這麼多上床機會了
I’d never have lost so many chances
to lose my virginity.

785
01:08:32,484 --> 01:08:37,251
-以聖保羅人來說你很酷
-謝了
-For a Sao Paulo guy you’re very cool.
-Thanks, bro.

786
01:08:37,456 --> 01:08:40,414
兇器是什麼？
What did they use?

787
01:08:40,726 --> 01:08:44,312
木棒或石頭
孩子呢？
A club or a rock.
And the child?

788
01:08:44,347 --> 01:08:47,898
-毫髮無傷 -謝天謝地
-Untouched.
-Thank goodness.

789
01:08:48,366 --> 01:08:52,216
死了多久？
大約4小時
-How long ago?
-About four hours.

790
01:08:52,251 --> 01:08:56,067
-可以搬走了嗎？ -搬吧
-Can we take it away?
-Go ahead.

791
01:08:57,442 --> 01:09:01,675
兇手一定是天主之城的人
The murderer has to be
from the City of God.

792
01:09:20,165 --> 01:09:24,693
混蛋，媽的
You bastard!
You motherfucker!

793
01:09:25,403 --> 01:09:28,787
你一定要在這裡殺人嗎？
Did you have to kill
your chick in the ghetto?

794
01:09:28,822 --> 01:09:31,532
引來一大堆條子
-The place is crawling with cops now!
-Come on, Li’l Z'.

795
01:09:31,743 --> 01:09:36,203
別這樣
去你的
我得維護名譽
-Come on? Fuck you!
-I had to avenge my honor.

796
01:09:36,414 --> 01:09:39,906
她家人去告我了，你很安全
Her family’s turned me in.
You won’t have any problems.

797
01:09:40,118 --> 01:09:43,610
你把員警引來，你死定了
The cops are everywhere because
of you. You’re dead meat, asshole.

798
01:09:43,822 --> 01:09:46,689
算了，你也打夠了
Let up, Li’l Z’.
You’ve punished him enough.

799
01:09:46,892 --> 01:09:49,197
你知道規矩
You know the law.

800
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:51,889
在我的地方殺人就得死
Anyone who kills in my ghetto
has to die as an example.

801
01:09:52,097 --> 01:09:54,795
那是他的事
That was his business, Li’l Z’.

802
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:57,494
聽著，離開貧民區
Listen, you sonofabitch,
get outta the ghetto.

803
01:09:57,702 --> 01:10:00,745
你太不懂規矩了
You showed no respect, understand?

804
01:10:03,341 --> 01:10:08,404
班尼，你太好心了，養虎為患
You know what, Benny?

805
01:10:04,843 --> 01:10:08,404
You’re too nice. If you raise
a snake, expect to get bitten.

806
01:10:08,613 --> 01:10:11,652
他只是個廢物
He wasn’t worth shit.

807
01:10:11,883 --> 01:10:14,567
背叛者
閉嘴
-A dirty traitor.
-Shut up, Tuba.

808
01:10:14,602 --> 01:10:17,252
我要帶馬子去散步
I’m going for a walk
with my girl.

809
01:10:17,455 --> 01:10:22,620
好，小心
等事情平息
Okay, be careful.
When things calm down...

810
01:10:22,828 --> 01:10:25,854
就繼續處理紅毛的事
we’ll get back to our business
with Carrot, okay?

811
01:10:30,802 --> 01:10:33,862
你需要交個女朋友
You need a girlfriend, Li’l Z’.

812
01:10:54,191 --> 01:10:56,421
你猜我在想什麼？
Know what I’m thinking, Benny?

813
01:10:57,061 --> 01:10:59,552
我太性感了？
That I’m so sexy?

814
01:10:59,764 --> 01:11:03,325
也有，不過還有一件事
That too. But I mean,
you know what we could do?

815
01:11:03,534 --> 01:11:07,554
-我是說真的
-你還想要
-Make love again.
-I’m serious.

816
01:11:07,671 --> 01:11:12,335
我們可以離開，我討厭暴力
We could go away from here.
This violence sucks.

817
01:11:13,577 --> 01:11:14,942
去哪裡？
Go where?

818
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:17,680
找個農場
To a farm.

819
01:11:19,383 --> 01:11:23,251
我們其實很嬉皮，不是嗎？
We’re really hippies at heart,
aren’t we?

820
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:26,782
農場？
A farm?

821
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:32,721
愛與和平？
Peace and love?

822
01:11:52,583 --> 01:11:57,316
（班尼的歡送會）
BENNY’S FAREWELL

823
01:12:05,996 --> 01:12:09,295
班尼人太好，不該繼續混兄弟
Benny was just too cool
to go on being a hoodlum.

824
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:13,129
他把所有的人都找來了
He succeeded in getting everybody
together for his good-bye party.

825
01:12:13,337 --> 01:12:14,634
道上兄弟
The gangs...

826
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,299
靈魂樂迷
The soul crowd...

827
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:28,246
-總有一天，我會上教堂
謝謝你前來參加我的派對
-教徒
-The religious crowd...
-One day, I’ll go to church.

828
01:12:28,452 --> 01:12:30,386
森巴樂迷
The samba crowd...

829
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:36,253
爵士樂迷
The groovy crowd...

830
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:43,056
還有沒跳過舞的小霸王
And Li’l Z', who had never
danced in his life.

831
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:07,078
-要不要跟我跳舞？ -什麼？
要不要跟我跳舞？
Want to dance with me?
Want to dance with me?

832
01:13:07,157 --> 01:13:09,557
-我聽不見 -要跳舞嗎？
-I didn’t hear...
-Want to dance?

833
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,854
不了，我有男伴
No, thank you, I’m with someone.

834
01:13:27,478 --> 01:13:29,105
阿炮
Hey, Rocket!

835
01:13:43,027 --> 01:13:46,463
過來，我有話要說
Come, I want to talk
to you, buddy.

836
01:13:47,431 --> 01:13:51,165
你不能跟那個女的走
為什麼？
-You can’t just split with that chick.
-Why not?

837
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:54,899
我要去住農場，哈麻聽搖滾樂
I'm gonna go live on a farm,
smoke pot, listen to rock.

838
01:13:55,105 --> 01:13:58,905
你要為了那個賤人拋棄一切？
You wanna throw away everything
we've accomplished for that bitch?

839
01:13:59,543 --> 01:14:02,603
她不是賤人，是我的女人
She's not a bitch, she's my girl.

840
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:05,407
我們把紅毛的生意搶來給你
We’ll take over Carrot’s business,
it’ll be yours.

841
01:14:05,616 --> 01:14:09,034
-別碰他，他是好人
-他是個混蛋
-Leave Carrot alone, he’s a good guy.
-He’s a motherfucker!

842
01:14:09,069 --> 01:14:12,452
你看誰都不順眼，所以我要走
See? Everyone’s a motherfucker
to you. That’s why I’m leaving.

843
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:18,790
我是你的朋友，但我要退出
我非走不可
I’m your friend,
but I’m getting out.
You got to understand,
I have to go.

844
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:24,367
我愛你，但我受夠了
I love you, man,
but I’ve had enough.

845
01:15:23,594 --> 01:15:25,960
混蛋，來看看你有沒有種
Motherfucker, let’s see
if you have any balls.

846
01:15:26,163 --> 01:15:30,218
幹什麼？
你想死嗎？滾開
-What is this?
-You wanna die? Fuck off, bitch!

847
01:15:30,334 --> 01:15:33,497
脫光，我要看你的屁股
Strip, nigger.
I wanna see your ass.

848
01:15:33,704 --> 01:15:38,073
快點脫
Hurry up!
Take it all off! Now!

849
01:15:38,809 --> 01:15:41,835
快脫，我要看你的屁股
I wanna see your ass.
Come on, faggot!

850
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:44,840
快啊，快點
Let’s go, nigger!

851
01:15:54,825 --> 01:15:57,794
把屁股露出來
Show your ass to everyone!

852
01:15:58,395 --> 01:16:00,022
別這樣
Please...

853
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:04,744
你這個失敗者

854
01:16:05,069 --> 01:16:07,629
脫光，快點
-Strip, dammit!
-Hurry it up!

855
01:16:19,416 --> 01:16:22,783
班尼，跟你換一袋白粉
What’s up, Benny?
This camera for a bag of coke?

856
01:16:22,986 --> 01:16:27,616
-我不賣了
-給個面子，我們是朋友
-I don’t deal anymore.
-C’mon, do it for me. You’re my friend.

857
01:16:27,825 --> 01:16:30,487
-這是贓物？ -是我爸的
-Is it stolen?
-It’s okay, it’s my dad’s.

858
01:16:31,228 --> 01:16:33,219
你爸的？
Your dad’s?

859
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:39,857
-去找小霸王換
-阿炮會很喜歡
-Give it to Li’l Z’.
-Rocket would love this camera.

860
01:16:43,674 --> 01:16:45,403
-拿去吧 -太好了
-Yeah, here.
-Great.

861
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:12,266
我來了
Here I am!

862
01:17:12,469 --> 01:17:14,723
-你想當攝影師？ -對
-You wanna be a photographer?
-Yeah.

863
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:19,950
-送你一個禮物
-媽的，太棒了
-Here’s a present.
-Shit, dude! This is great!

864
01:17:20,577 --> 01:17:25,352
搖屁股，快點
搖啊
Now move your ass.
Shake it!

865
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,826
你會照出好照片
You’ll take some great pictures.

866
01:17:48,705 --> 01:17:50,673
拿來
Give me that.

867
01:17:55,913 --> 01:18:02,148
-把相機還我 -不要
-Give me back the camera!
-No!

868
01:18:05,088 --> 01:18:11,755
你有什麼毛病？
What’s your problem?
Are you crazy?

869
01:18:38,956 --> 01:18:42,517
班尼被殺了
They’ve killed Benny!

870
01:18:44,127 --> 01:18:49,539
幹，叫救護車
兇手在哪裡？
Fuck! Call an ambulance!
Where’s the motherfucker who did it?

871
01:18:49,866 --> 01:18:55,522
-小霸王，班尼死了
-不，快找醫生
-Z’, Benny is dead.
-No! Call a doctor!

872
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:05,040
滾，都是你害的
Get out of here, bitch!
It’s your fault!

873
01:19:05,858 --> 01:19:09,444
混蛋
Motherfucker!

874
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:35,658
紅毛呢？
Where's Carrot?

875
01:19:35,693 --> 01:19:37,807
黑仔來了
Blacky's here.

876
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:42,777
他闖禍了
He's in trouble.

877
01:19:44,011 --> 01:19:46,584
我完了
I’m fucked.

878
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:49,048
-為什麼？ -我完了
-I’m fucked.
-Why?

879
01:19:47,978 --> 01:19:54,456
你也是
我殺了班尼，小霸王要來了
And you are too.
I think I killed Benny.

880
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:54,456
Li’l Z’ is coming
to take your place.

881
01:19:54,491 --> 01:19:56,929
我們可以去舞廳幹掉他
We can get him,
he's in the dance hall.

882
01:19:56,964 --> 01:19:57,963
你殺了班尼？
You killed Benny?

883
01:19:57,998 --> 01:20:02,496
是他動了，我想殺小霸王
I didn’t mean to. He moved.
I was aiming at Li’l Z’.

884
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:05,048
我們快去
Come on, let’s go.

885
01:20:05,083 --> 01:20:06,730
黑仔
Blacky...

886
01:20:06,765 --> 01:20:10,406
你殺了天主之城最酷的流氓
You killed the coolest
hood in the City of God.

887
01:20:10,441 --> 01:20:12,878
我們去幹掉小…
Let’s go get Li’l Z’.

888
01:20:19,813 --> 01:20:25,521
紅毛知道現在只能靠奇跡了
Carrot knew that without Benny only
a miracle could save his business.

889
01:20:25,556 --> 01:20:28,823
我們完了
We’re fucked, man.

890
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:43,710
有哪裡比天主之城
更適合發生奇跡？
But what better place for a miracle to
happen than in the City of God?

891
01:20:46,289 --> 01:20:49,251
是我的甜心美眉
Look who’s here.
My sugar babe.

892
01:20:48,377 --> 01:20:51,114
-讓我過去 -親一個嘛
-Let me by.
-Gimme a kiss, girl.

893
01:20:50,290 --> 01:20:55,280
讓我過去，你照過鏡子嗎？
Let me by, please.
Have you seen what you look like?

894
01:20:56,622 --> 01:21:00,387
小霸王，走吧
Come on, Li’l Z’.

895
01:21:06,225 --> 01:21:11,363
親愛的
你好嗎？
Hi, honey.
Everything okay, baby?

896
01:21:18,019 --> 01:21:25,682
問題很簡單
小霸王很醜，帥奈德很帥
The problem was simple. Li’l Z' was
ugly. Knockout Ned was handsome.

897
01:21:25,012 --> 01:21:31,953
帥奈德泡妞很輕鬆
小霸王只能買或是來硬的
Li’l Z' had to pay or use force.
Knockout Ned could get any girl.

898
01:21:31,988 --> 01:21:38,598
這是帥好人和醜壞人的對決
It was a duel between
the handsome good guy...
and the ugly bad guy.

899
01:21:38,633 --> 01:21:45,251
-放開我
-好好享受
-Let me go!
-Just enjoy it.

900
01:21:48,678 --> 01:21:54,139
反抗也沒用，你是我的了
There’s no use fighting.
You’re mine now.

901
01:21:57,403 --> 01:22:01,585
豬頭，你馬子真辣
Hey, faggot, your broad’s
really hot!

902
01:22:32,856 --> 01:22:36,188
我根本不敢看她
I can’t even look her in
the face now.

903
01:22:37,552 --> 01:22:39,281
我沒辦法

904
01:22:45,241 --> 01:22:49,672
他怎麼不殺了我？
Why didn’t that fucker kill me?

905
01:22:52,792 --> 01:22:57,873
慢著
我怎麼不殺了他？
Hold on...
Why didn't I kill that fucker?

906
01:22:57,908 --> 01:22:59,298
我們回去
Let’s go back.

907
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:03,248
-那紅毛呢？ -待會再說
-We’ll get back to him.
-What about Carrot?

908
01:23:03,283 --> 01:23:04,681
你要殺了他？
You gonna kill him?

909
01:23:08,391 --> 01:23:12,452
帥奈德，你的妞好賤
Knockout Ned, your chick’s a slut.
Come out, motherfucker!

910
01:23:12,662 --> 01:23:17,546
出來
別理他
-Come out, you loser!
-Take it easy...

911
01:23:17,581 --> 01:23:22,431
我要出去，放開我
I’m going out. Let me go.

912
01:23:33,915 --> 01:23:37,911
葛森，回來
Gerson! Come back, son!

913
01:23:47,658 --> 01:23:52,333
與你無關，我們要找你哥
This doesn’t concern you, kid.
We’re here for your brother.

914
01:23:52,536 --> 01:23:55,903
有話好說，我哥脾氣很好
Let’s talk, we can work it out.
My brother’s a peaceful guy.

915
01:23:56,106 --> 01:23:59,303
他不屑見我？叫他出來
Is he too good-looking
to come talk to me? Call him.

916
01:23:59,338 --> 01:24:01,990
他什麼都沒做
He hasn't done anything.

917
01:24:01,344 --> 01:24:04,643
你知道我是誰？
You know who I am?

918
01:24:04,010 --> 01:24:07,908
-我是小霸王 -他是小霸王
-Li’l Z’, man.
-He’s Li’l Z’.

919
01:24:07,943 --> 01:24:11,385
叫那個混蛋出來
Call that motherfucker!

920
01:24:16,059 --> 01:24:18,518
快去
Go on, man.

921
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:21,726
別激動，我去叫他
Calm down, I’ll call him.

922
01:24:54,667 --> 01:24:58,733
我的手臂受傷了，先放過紅毛
My arm! I hurt my arm.
Carrot will have to wait.

923
01:24:58,768 --> 01:25:01,267
這傢伙活該
That loser got what he deserved.

924
01:25:01,302 --> 01:25:03,462
走吧
Let’s go!

925
01:25:26,397 --> 01:25:31,133
葛森
Gerson...

926
01:25:30,711 --> 01:25:34,929
那混蛋殺了我弟
That bastard killed my brother.

927
01:25:41,914 --> 01:25:45,643
我不能放過他
I can’t let that go.

928
01:25:59,241 --> 01:26:02,991
-要槍嗎？
-兒子
-Want a gun?
-My son...

929
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:06,600
媽，別激動
Calm down, mom.

930
01:26:07,437 --> 01:26:15,239
別這樣，媽
Please, mom...

931
01:26:19,115 --> 01:26:22,168
好好擦乾淨
Do it right, asshole.

932
01:26:22,203 --> 01:26:26,717
-只能這樣擦
-我怎麼會被他刺傷？
-There’s no other way.
-How’d I let that loser hit me?

933
01:26:26,923 --> 01:26:29,391
Shit, that’s some hole.

934
01:26:57,934 --> 01:27:02,114
-我們好像兄弟 -閉嘴
-It’s as if we were brothers.
-Shut up.

935
01:27:01,517 --> 01:27:06,853
我們都傷到手臂 你是這一手，我是另一手
Both of us hurt in the arm.
You by one brother, me the other.

936
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:10,863
-閉嘴 -真難令人相信
閉嘴
It would be really funny
if we were brothers.

937
01:27:11,067 --> 01:27:17,231
那個帥奈德真不賴
突然冒出來
That Knockout Ned's not bad, eh?
He came out of nowhere.

938
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:21,570
閉嘴，煩死了
Shut up, Tuba!
You're a fucking pain!

939
01:27:28,168 --> 01:27:33,283
天主之城突然出現一個英雄
It was as if the City of God
had suddenly found a hero.

940
01:27:33,318 --> 01:27:34,534
上帝保佑你
God bless you, son.

941
01:27:34,569 --> 01:27:39,124
這孩子是自尋死路
That kid was just asking
to be killed.

942
01:27:39,329 --> 01:27:45,463
幹得好
你做得很好
Well done.
You did a good job.

943
01:27:45,668 --> 01:27:49,297
你最好躲起來
You’d better go hide.

944
01:27:50,922 --> 01:27:55,173
我以為帥奈德會發動革命
I thought Knockout Ned
would start a revolution here.

945
01:27:55,378 --> 01:27:58,710
但天主有別的計畫
But God had other plans.

946
01:27:58,745 --> 01:28:01,568
牛排，那些賣家呢？
Steak,
where are all the dealers?

947
01:28:01,603 --> 01:28:05,528
躲起來了，小霸王心情很差
They’re hiding.
Li’l Z’ is in a bad mood.

948
01:28:05,563 --> 01:28:09,453
害人上癮之後就躲起來
They get us hooked and then
they go off and hide.

949
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:12,890
幫個忙，弄些糖粉給我
Do me a favor. Go get some
nose candy for me.

950
01:28:13,096 --> 01:28:14,093
我試試看
I’ll try.

951
01:28:14,128 --> 01:28:18,155
就說是提亞哥要提神
Tell them it’s for Thiago,
to keep my buzz going.

952
01:28:37,855 --> 01:28:44,124
牛排，去告訴紅毛
Steak’n’fries,
go to Carrot’s and tell him...

953
01:28:43,771 --> 01:28:49,696
你殺了奈德，他就放過你
Li’l Z' says that if you kill
Knockout, he’ll leave you alone.

954
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:53,199
帥奈德，你聽到了嗎？
Hey, Knockout Ned.
Did you hear that?

955
01:28:53,234 --> 01:28:56,064
捉住他
Grab the kid!

956
01:28:57,304 --> 01:29:03,906
你聽到了嗎？
你不跟著我們就死定了
You heard the boy? If you don't
stick with us, you're dead.

957
01:29:03,941 --> 01:29:07,679
你應該跟我們一起合作
I think you should join us.
We'll be partners.

958
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:10,282
我不碰毒品
Drugs aren't my thing.

959
01:29:10,317 --> 01:29:14,251
這是我跟他的私事
This is just something
between me and him.

960
01:29:13,522 --> 01:29:18,186
Those guys aren’t worth shit.
他們都是垃圾

961
01:29:18,172 --> 01:29:21,989
為了權力什麼都幹
They'll do anything for power.

962
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:24,198
就像那孩子
Like that kid.

963
01:29:24,233 --> 01:29:28,863
他們沒血沒淚，就像這小子
They're all robots,
like this punk here.

964
01:29:28,898 --> 01:29:31,436
你在想什麼？
What’s in your head, kid?

965
01:29:31,471 --> 01:29:33,453
這樣是自毀前程
Can't you see you're
wrecking your life...

966
01:29:33,488 --> 01:29:38,408
跟那些瘋子暴力狂鬼混
with that maniac and a bunch
of trigger-happy fools?

967
01:29:38,985 --> 01:29:46,549
-你瘋了嗎？你只是個孩子
-孩子？我哈草嗑藥，殺人放火
-Are you crazy? You’re just a kid.
-A kid? I smoke, snort...

968
01:29:46,584 --> 01:29:50,054
我是男人
I’ve killed and robbed.
I’m a man.

969
01:29:50,259 --> 01:29:52,784
你懂個屁
Shit, you have no idea!

970
01:29:52,995 --> 01:29:57,148
他很忠心，你應該加入我們
He’s attached to his gang.
You should join up with us.

971
01:29:56,432 --> 01:30:01,301
要殺他嗎？
你要變絞肉了
-Shall we kill him?
-Steak, we're going to grind you.

972
01:30:01,808 --> 01:30:07,137
好，我接受
太好了
-Okay, I accept.
-Great!

973
01:30:07,343 --> 01:30:12,595
回去說該帥奈德和紅毛當家了
Tell your boss that Knockout Ned
and Carrot are now in command.

974
01:30:11,647 --> 01:30:17,847
有一個條件，不准濫殺無辜
But on one condition:
no killing of innocent people.

975
01:30:18,404 --> 01:30:22,082
我無法接受亂殺人
I can't accept that, understand?

976
01:30:22,117 --> 01:30:26,955
不殺無辜
Okay, no innocent people.

977
01:30:28,364 --> 01:30:33,301
牛排搞砸了
Steak fucked up!

978
01:30:43,976 --> 01:30:47,574
有我的槍嗎？
-Have you a gun for me?
-No...

979
01:30:45,716 --> 01:30:51,184
沒有，不過可以去搶
but we can hold up
a gun store.

980
01:30:51,219 --> 01:30:52,847
小事一樁
That’s no problem.

981
01:30:52,882 --> 01:30:57,251
我不想搶劫 我不是兄弟
I don’t want to hold up anything.
I’m not a hoodlum.

982
01:30:57,286 --> 01:31:00,656
這是我和他的私事
This is a personal affair
between me and him, okay?

983
01:31:00,691 --> 01:31:03,594
我不是兄弟
I’m not a hoodlum.

984
01:31:04,782 --> 01:31:07,936
他奸了你的妞
He raped your chick...

985
01:31:07,043 --> 01:31:11,971
殺了你的叔叔弟弟，轟爛你家
killed your uncle and brother,
gunned your house...

986
01:31:12,006 --> 01:31:15,541
而你只殺了他一個手下
and you killed one of his guys.

987
01:31:18,872 --> 01:31:23,510
你不是兄弟就出去
If you’re not a hood,
then get out.

988
01:31:27,396 --> 01:31:33,027
（帥奈德的故事）
THE STORY OF KNOCKOUT NED

989
01:31:34,195 --> 01:31:36,686
搶劫
This is a hold-up!

990
01:31:43,853 --> 01:31:48,368
第一次…
左輪呢？
-The first time...
-Where are the revolvers?

991
01:31:48,576 --> 01:31:52,205
帥奈德救了一個店員
...Knockout Ned saved a salesclerk
from being shot by Carrot.

992
01:31:52,413 --> 01:31:55,614
說好不殺人的
We said no killing!

993
01:31:55,649 --> 01:31:58,815
這是規則
That’s the rule.

994
01:31:59,195 --> 01:32:08,394
我們來搶老闆的錢
你們希望我們走？我們也是
We want the boss’ money. Everyone
keep calm. Open the cash register!
You want us to go?
We do too.

995
01:32:08,596 --> 01:32:11,030
所以動作快
So hurry up!

996
01:32:11,408 --> 01:32:16,803
看地上
第二次，紅毛救了帥奈德
-Look at the ground!
-The second time...
Carrot saved
Knockout Ned's life.

997
01:32:18,784 --> 01:32:22,702
奈德學到每個規則都有例外
Ned learned that there's
an exception to every rule.

998
01:32:22,737 --> 01:32:25,676
這是例外
Exception to the rule.

999
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:28,317
-你是經理？ -對
-Are you the manager?
-Yes.

1000
01:32:28,352 --> 01:32:33,176
這是搶劫
統統趴在地上
This is a hold-up.
Everyone on the ground!

1001
01:32:33,211 --> 01:32:35,413
趴下
On the ground!

1002
01:32:35,623 --> 01:32:39,855
把錢給我
Give me the money!

1003
01:32:42,797 --> 01:32:45,027
我不是在說笑，誰動就讓他死
I’m not kidding.

1004
01:32:45,233 --> 01:32:51,498
第三次，例外成了規則
The first person who moves
is dead!
The third time, the exception
becomes the rule.

1005
01:33:06,274 --> 01:33:11,657
利用搶來的錢 他們準備跟小霸王拼了
prepared to face Li’l Z'.
Carrot and Knockout Ned

1006
01:33:11,859 --> 01:33:14,068
紅毛可以保住生意
Carrot could protect his
business.

1007
01:33:14,103 --> 01:33:19,833
營上第一神射的帥奈德 則想報仇
Knockout Ned...
the best marksman in his battalion,
wanted revenge.

1008
01:33:20,034 --> 01:33:23,618
先是義大利槍，9釐米的
First, the Italians.
This is a 9 mm.

1009
01:33:23,653 --> 01:33:27,203
-我看看 -不錯吧？
-Let me see.
-Not bad, eh?

1010
01:33:26,523 --> 01:33:32,107
-準星有問題
-我算你特價
-The sight isn’t well-aligned.
-I’ll give you a good price.

1011
01:33:32,333 --> 01:33:36,778
12釐米※打炮槍§…懂了吧？
The 12 mm, the "hand job".
See why?

1012
01:33:36,224 --> 01:33:40,045
9釐米烏茲衝鋒槍，以色列貨
An Uzi, 9 mm. It’s Israeli.

1013
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,384
大衛之星
猶太貨
-The star of David.
-Jewish.

1014
01:33:42,419 --> 01:33:44,972
我要30-06步槍
I want a 30-06.

1015
01:33:45,007 --> 01:33:47,525
可以大幹一場了
Now we can start having fun.

1016
01:33:47,729 --> 01:33:51,503
要開戰了，先來禱告
The war’s on.
Let’s start with a prayer.

1017
01:33:51,538 --> 01:33:57,926
我們在天上的父
願人都遵你的名為聖
Our Father who art in heaven
hallowed be our name...

1018
01:33:56,738 --> 01:34:00,902
願我們的旨意行在地上
Our will be done...

1019
01:34:00,937 --> 01:34:05,179
如同行在天上
On earth as it is in heaven...

1020
01:34:16,519 --> 01:34:19,250
流氓有槍，但不會用
Hoodlums have guns,
but can't shoot.

1021
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:23,587
帥奈德開一槍能抵小霸王十槍
was worth ten from Li’l Z”s gang.
One bullet from Knockout Ned

1022
01:34:23,389 --> 01:34:27,928
小霸王氣不過，展開反擊
Li’l Z' couldn't take it.
He counter-attacked.

1023
01:34:29,774 --> 01:34:34,803
貧民區從人間煉獄落入地獄
The ghetto had been a purgatory,
now it was hell.

1024
01:34:37,950 --> 01:34:44,446
我決心離開，所以去當記者
I decided to get out.
That's how I became a reporter.

1025
01:34:44,526 --> 01:34:50,423
好棒的照片，一定是羅葛瑞的
I bet it’s by Rogerio Reis.
Great photo!

1026
01:34:50,458 --> 01:34:53,825
我就說吧
What did I tell you?

1027
01:34:53,155 --> 01:34:59,867
我跟其他行家一樣從基層做起
Like any pro...
I started at the bottom,
way down at the bottom.

1028
01:34:58,924 --> 01:35:03,526
未來仍是一片茫然
Without knowing what awaited me.

1029
01:35:04,288 --> 01:35:08,142
我不回家，跑去報社
I’d go over to the paper.
Instead of going home

1030
01:35:07,697 --> 01:35:11,709
研究室有個來自天主之城的人
A guy from the City of God
worked in the lab.

1031
01:35:11,744 --> 01:35:13,925
你看
Check this out.

1032
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:19,043
他讓我更接近生命中的最愛
He helped me move closer to
what I loved most in life.

1033
01:35:19,078 --> 01:35:20,880
-羅葛瑞 -你好嗎？
-Hi, Rogerio.
-How are you, Pierre?

1034
01:35:21,089 --> 01:35:23,717
這是阿炮，他是攝影師
This is Rocket.
He’s a photographer.

1035
01:35:23,752 --> 01:35:24,711
阿炮，你好
Hello, Rocket.

1036
01:35:24,746 --> 01:35:27,557
-他很喜歡你 -真的？
-He’s a fan of yours.
-Really?

1037
01:35:27,592 --> 01:35:29,024
你真有品味
You have good taste, Rocket!

1038
01:35:29,059 --> 01:35:32,691
-我先走了 -再見
-Well, I’m done. I’m off.
-See you.

1039
01:35:32,726 --> 01:35:35,562
他人真好
What a cool guy!

1040
01:35:35,566 --> 01:35:42,165
單純的復仇演變成大火拼
What should have been
a swift revenge...
turned into an all-out war.

1041
01:35:46,595 --> 01:35:50,056
天主之城一分為二
The City of God was divided.

1042
01:35:50,091 --> 01:35:53,021
兩區不能相通
You couldn't go from one
section to the other.

1043
01:35:53,056 --> 01:35:55,951
連拜訪親戚都不行
Not even to visit a relative.

1044
01:35:55,257 --> 01:35:59,888
員警把貧民區的人都當流氓
The cops considered anyone
living in the ghetto a hoodlum.

1045
01:35:59,923 --> 01:36:03,530
大家過著越戰的生活
People got used to living
in Vietnam.

1046
01:36:06,947 --> 01:36:12,695
越來越多人自願送死
And more and more volunteers
kept signing up to die.

1047
01:36:10,456 --> 01:36:13,896
他要找你
有什麼事？
This kid...

1048
01:36:14,108 --> 01:36:16,425
我被紅毛的小弟揍
-What do you want?
-A boy from Carrot’s gang punched me.

1049
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:18,743
火拼成了藉口
The war was
an excuse for everything.

1050
01:36:19,147 --> 01:36:21,115
小霸王的打手踹我
One of Li’l Z”s soldiers
kicked me.

1051
01:36:22,499 --> 01:36:25,176
拿這把點22
Take this .22.

1052
01:36:26,257 --> 01:36:29,456
紅毛的人強暴我姊
The jerk who raped my sister is
with Carrot.

1053
01:36:29,657 --> 01:36:30,814
小霸王趕走我家
Li’l Z’ evicted my family.

1054
01:36:30,849 --> 01:36:33,720
我想殺人，讓別人怕我
Kill... Be respected.

1055
01:36:46,107 --> 01:36:51,568
我是提亞哥，班尼的朋友
-你認識字嗎？會加減嗎？
-I’m Thiago, a friend of Benny’s.
-Can you read? Can you add?

1056
01:36:51,779 --> 01:36:56,874
-我蠻會管生意的
-那就開工吧
-I’m pretty good in business.
-Okay, get to work.

1057
01:36:56,909 --> 01:37:04,253
-幹掉殺父仇人-你想幹嘛？
-你叫什麼？-奧圖
-To get my father’s murderer.
-What’s your name?
-My name’s Otto.
-What do you want?

1058
01:37:08,981 --> 01:37:11,665
怎麼回事？
What’s the matter?

1059
01:37:10,895 --> 01:37:15,825
-他是個工人 -他想要槍
-He’s a worker.
-But he wants a gun.

1060
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:19,233
他撐不了1星期
He won’t last a week.

1061
01:37:29,474 --> 01:37:35,086
1年後，沒有人記得前因後果
A year later, no one
remembered how it had all begun.

1062
01:37:35,289 --> 01:37:36,620
去死吧
Take that!

1063
01:37:38,589 --> 01:37:45,366
兩邊都想搶對方的生意
For both sides, the aim was to take
over the enemy's business in order...

1064
01:37:43,876 --> 01:37:49,093
好買更多槍，搶更多生意
to buy more guns and take over
more businesses.

1065
01:38:10,041 --> 01:38:14,375
我哈草嗑藥，殺人放火
I’ve killed and robbed.
I smoke, snort,

1066
01:38:14,410 --> 01:38:16,660
我是男人
I’m a man.

1067
01:38:37,492 --> 01:38:43,347
媒體開始報導，警方只好干涉
The media started taking an interest.
The police had to intervene.

1068
01:38:57,305 --> 01:39:00,471
一名天主之城的角頭被捕
A gang leader, from the City of God,
was arrested today.

1069
01:39:00,506 --> 01:39:03,638

Manuel Machado,
a.k.a. Knockout Ned...

1070
01:39:03,844 --> 01:39:06,761
遭小霸王的人槍傷送醫
was hospitalized after being
wounded by Li’l Z”s gang.

1071
01:39:06,796 --> 01:39:09,678
本台記者專訪到他
Our reporter interviewed him.

1072
01:39:09,325 --> 01:39:13,843
火拼還在持續嗎？
還在持續
-Is the war still going on?
-It's still going on.

1073
01:39:13,292 --> 01:39:21,184
死了多少人？
很多，大多是無辜者
-Have many people died?
-Many have died.
Mostly innocent people.

1074
01:39:21,195 --> 01:39:24,562
光是認識我就會被小霸王殺
Just knowing me is enough...

1075
01:39:24,765 --> 01:39:29,498
to get you killed by Li’l Z'.

1076
01:39:29,704 --> 01:39:34,722
-警方都不管嗎？
-他們捉我，不捉他
-The police don’t go in there?
-They go after me, not him.

1077
01:39:33,274 --> 01:39:39,611
I’ve been in jail, while he goes
我坐牢，他拼命殺人
on killing undisturbed.

1078
01:39:39,814 --> 01:39:41,438
員警卻不捉
And they don’t arrest him.

1079
01:39:41,473 --> 01:39:44,414
帥奈德說火拼將持續
Knockout Ned says
the war will continue.

1080
01:39:44,618 --> 01:39:50,215

Police Chief Guedes has promised
to arrest both of the gangs.

1081
01:39:58,035 --> 01:40:00,428
媽的
Motherfucker!

1082
01:39:59,914 --> 01:40:04,195
老大是我，上報的卻是他
I’m the boss here, but he gets
his picture in the paper!

1083
01:40:04,405 --> 01:40:07,966
-有我的照片嗎？ -只有帥奈德的
-Have you found mine?
-Just Knockout Ned’s.

1084
01:40:08,175 --> 01:40:12,774
繼續找，至少名字要見報
Keep looking.

1085
01:40:10,044 --> 01:40:12,774
At least my name’s
got to be in there.

1086
01:40:12,980 --> 01:40:14,675
-什麼都沒有 -你認識字嗎？
-There’s nothing.
-Can you read?

1087
01:40:14,882 --> 01:40:17,316
只認得照片
Just the pictures.

1088
01:40:18,285 --> 01:40:20,344
什麼都沒有
Nothing.

1089
01:40:20,554 --> 01:40:23,258
喂，你幹什麼？
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

1090
01:40:23,293 --> 01:40:28,989
那是分類廣告
我不管，要全都看過
-It’s just the want ads.
-I don’t care, read everything!

1091
01:40:28,361 --> 01:40:33,360
-上面又沒有新聞
-你想挨子彈嗎？
-But there aren’t any articles.
-Want a bullet in your head?

1092
01:40:34,670 --> 01:40:38,861
讓他們知道誰是老大
Gotta show them who’s boss here.

1093
01:40:43,055 --> 01:40:47,608
-把相機給我 -不要
-Give me the camera!
-No way!

1094
01:40:50,151 --> 01:40:52,483
幫我照相
Take my picture, man.

1095
01:40:52,518 --> 01:40:55,817
我按不下去
I can’t work it.

1096
01:40:55,852 --> 01:40:57,718
快點
Go ahead.

1097
01:40:58,092 --> 01:41:02,654
-我來穩住法冠
-我試試看
-I’ll hold the Beretta.
-Let me try...

1098
01:41:02,689 --> 01:41:05,993
讓開
Back off...

1099
01:41:05,530 --> 01:41:10,466
-按不下去
-真是一群飯桶
-There’s no click.
-What a bunch of bozos!

1100
01:41:10,501 --> 01:41:13,735
帶著你們穩死的
I’m fucked with you guys.

1101
01:41:15,810 --> 01:41:18,370
我知道了
I have an idea.

1102
01:41:18,579 --> 01:41:23,107
我去找朋友來，別急
I’ll go get a guy I know.
Hang loose.

1103
01:41:23,170 --> 01:41:27,886
他來了
相機拿去
-Here he is.
-Take the camera.

1104
01:41:27,131 --> 01:41:31,023
小子，如何？
Well, kid?

1105
01:41:31,450 --> 01:41:37,496
你不是攝影師嗎？讓相機動，我們不會弄
Aren’t you a photographer?
Make the camerawork. We can’t do it.

1106
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:41,097
幫我們照相
Take our picture.

1107
01:41:45,401 --> 01:41:49,840
-你弄壞了 -不是我
-It wasn’t me.
-You fucking broke it.

1108
01:41:49,875 --> 01:41:56,109
要轉一下
I found it.
It has to be wound.

1109
01:42:00,554 --> 01:42:04,207
-你叫什麼？ -阿炮
-What’s your name?
-Rocket.

1110
01:42:04,242 --> 01:42:06,311
阿炮，再來一張
-Another picture, Rocket.
-How about two rows?

1111
01:42:06,346 --> 01:42:12,965
-排成兩排好了 -什麼？
排成兩排，把槍拿著
-What?
-Two rows. Everyone with their guns.

1112
01:42:13,096 --> 01:42:17,761
-喂，你出鏡了
-口氣好一點
-You’re outside, for Christ’s sake!
-Talk to him nicely, kid.

1113
01:42:17,972 --> 01:42:19,906
抱歉，請站進來
Sorry. Move in, please.

1114
01:42:22,409 --> 01:42:24,877
再一張
Another one.

1115
01:42:28,195 --> 01:42:31,548
-底片沒了
-那就拿出來看
-I think the roll’s finished.
-Then show us the pictures.

1116
01:42:31,752 --> 01:42:33,310
得拿去洗
-They have to be developed.
-Developed?

1117
01:42:33,345 --> 01:42:37,517
洗？要多少錢？
How much is it?

1118
01:42:37,415 --> 01:42:43,270
這些錢拿去，洗好拿給我
我拿底片
Take this money.
And bring back the pictures.

1119
01:42:42,730 --> 01:42:47,997
不必，整台拿去
-I have to remove the film.
-Keep the camera.

1120
01:42:47,958 --> 01:42:52,905
班尼不是要送你？拿去吧
didn’t he? So, it’s yours...
Benny wanted to give it to you,

1121
01:42:52,940 --> 01:42:54,938
謝了
Thanks.

1122
01:42:56,877 --> 01:43:01,075
別忘了拿照片來
相片，阿炮
Don’t forget the pictures.
The photos, Rocket!

1123
01:43:11,093 --> 01:43:14,677
-皮耶 -怎樣？
-Pierre!
-What?

1124
01:43:14,712 --> 01:43:18,568
可以幫我洗嗎？
Can you develop this for me?

1125
01:43:18,603 --> 01:43:21,774
不行，會惹上麻煩
I can’t, Rocket.
I could get into trouble.

1126
01:43:21,809 --> 01:43:25,506
社裡的記者才能在這裡洗
It’s only for the paper’s reporters.
I could risk my job.

1127
01:43:25,573 --> 01:43:27,063
皮耶，這些幫我洗
-Pierre?
-Yes, Rogerio?

1128
01:43:27,274 --> 01:43:31,904
還有這卷，好嗎？
Develop these for me.
This one too, okay?

1129
01:43:32,313 --> 01:43:34,679
我去吃飯了
I’m going to lunch.

1130
01:43:34,882 --> 01:43:39,395
你真幸運，要洗多大？
什麼？
You’re lucky. What size?

1131
01:43:39,430 --> 01:43:42,587
你要放多大？
-What?
-For the enlargement, what size?

1132
01:43:43,057 --> 01:43:46,857
你幫我決定吧
Well... Whatever you think is best.

1133
01:44:06,647 --> 01:44:08,774
-拿去 -謝了
-Here.
-Thanks.

1134
01:44:12,049 --> 01:44:15,315
我完了
I’m in deep shit now.

1135
01:44:16,711 --> 01:44:19,749
死定了
I’m as good as dead.

1136
01:44:30,210 --> 01:44:33,487
有人把我送上死路
Someone had signed
my death sentence.

1137
01:44:33,522 --> 01:44:36,765
我要揍扁他的臉
I wanted to bash the jerk's face in.

1138
01:44:42,449 --> 01:44:46,078
你是瑪莉娜？你偷我的照片
Are you Marina?
Because of you I’m dead.

1139
01:44:46,113 --> 01:44:47,849
你害死我了
You stole my photos.

1140
01:44:47,884 --> 01:44:52,912
什麼意思？小聲一點
Dead? Stole? What do you mean?
Not so loud.

1141
01:44:53,242 --> 01:44:56,319
小聲？你害我會被殺
I’ll be killed because of you.
Not so loud?

1142
01:44:56,530 --> 01:44:59,090
你不在，照片擺在那裡
You were gone,
your photos were in the lab.

1143
01:44:59,299 --> 01:45:00,931
我也沒辦法
There's nothing I can do.
The photos in our lab...

1144
01:45:00,966 --> 01:45:05,134
研究室的照片就是要登的
are photos to be published
in the paper.

1145
01:45:05,339 --> 01:45:08,604
我看到就拿來登了
I saw the photos,
I published them.

1146
01:45:08,809 --> 01:45:11,209
-你把它偷走 -我沒有，在這裡
-You stole them.
-I did not. Here they are.

1147
01:45:11,412 --> 01:45:15,781
-撿起來給我 -等一下…
-Give them to me.
-Just a second.

1148
01:45:15,983 --> 01:45:19,111
拿去
Here are your photos.

1149
01:45:19,319 --> 01:45:23,085
-還有嗎？
-冷靜一下，你叫什麼？
-Are there any others?
-Calm down. What’s your name?

1150
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:26,407
-阿炮 -阿炮？
-Rocket.
-Rocket?

1151
01:45:26,442 --> 01:45:29,694
你好，我是瑪莉娜
I’m Marina.
Nice to meet you.

1152
01:45:29,217 --> 01:45:35,392
你別激動 我有照片使用費要給你
Now, relax. I have money for you.
For your pictures.

1153
01:45:35,803 --> 01:45:40,831
我們登照片就會付錢給攝影師
Here, when we use a picture
we pay the photographer.

1154
01:45:41,041 --> 01:45:44,067
-你想當攝影師？ -對
-Do you want to be a photographer?
-Yes.

1155
01:45:44,278 --> 01:45:48,146
-帥喔，上頭版
-你是怎麼照到的？
-Great start! On the front page.
-How’d you get these photos?

1156
01:45:48,348 --> 01:45:49,187
我住在那裡
-I live there.
-Rocket...

1157
01:45:49,222 --> 01:45:54,353
阿炮，沒有攝影師進得去
no photographer has ever been able
to go in there.

1158
01:45:55,823 --> 01:46:00,453
要是你能照更多小霸王的照片
If you could bring us
more pictures of Li’l Z’...

1159
01:46:00,488 --> 01:46:05,689
報社會買，我們會付錢
the paper would buy them.
We’d pay you.

1160
01:46:05,724 --> 01:46:07,878
你行嗎？
Could you?

1161
01:46:07,913 --> 01:46:10,033
我不知道
I don’t know.

1162
01:46:10,337 --> 01:46:11,702
問題在哪裡？
What’s the problem?

1163
01:46:11,905 --> 01:46:14,738
我晚上不能過去了
The problem? I can’t go there
anymore at night.

1164
01:46:14,942 --> 01:46:19,208
-太冒險了
-那白天呢？
-And during the day?
-It’s too risky.

1165
01:46:19,944 --> 01:46:26,343
你看，他們終於知道我是老大
Look, man! They’ve finally
understood that I’m the boss.

1166
01:46:27,988 --> 01:46:29,785
你朋友叫什麼？
What’s your
photographer-friend’s name?

1167
01:46:29,990 --> 01:46:31,218
阿炮
Rocket.

1168
01:46:31,425 --> 01:46:34,622
他真行，我要多買幾份去發
He’s good. I’ll take more
to show the others.

1169
01:46:36,956 --> 01:46:41,063
怎樣，要不要？
So, Rocket, is it yes or no?

1170
01:46:41,723 --> 01:46:46,306
這是個大好機會
It’s a great opportunity.

1171
01:46:48,242 --> 01:46:49,641
好吧
Okay.

1172
01:46:50,878 --> 01:46:55,645
-我給你底片、鏡頭
-正確的選擇，很好
-You made the right choice. Very good!
-I’ll give you some film, lenses...

1173
01:46:55,682 --> 01:47:01,382
乾脆換台相機 我帶你去器材室
and even another camera.
I’ll show you the equipment room.

1174
01:47:01,588 --> 01:47:04,853
還有一個問題
There’s another problem.

1175
01:47:05,058 --> 01:47:08,084
-什麼？ -我今晚要睡哪裡？
-What is it?
-Where can I sleep tonight?

1176
01:47:08,199 --> 01:47:11,524
我不能回去
I can’t go back now.

1177
01:47:13,558 --> 01:47:18,862
這是135釐米的
你會在近還是遠？
This is a 135 mm.
Will you be close up or far away?

1178
01:47:19,072 --> 01:47:20,061
遠
Far away.

1179
01:47:20,541 --> 01:47:23,066
-會調光圈嗎？ -會
-Can you measure the light?
-Yes.

1180
01:47:25,179 --> 01:47:27,977
你太近了吧？
Aren’t you too close?

1181
01:47:29,492 --> 01:47:36,416
我居然敢找他們理論 也許我會死
I don’t know what spurred me
to go talk to them like that.
Maybe I was going to die...

1182
01:47:36,451 --> 01:47:39,687
但現在我有一台相機
but now I had a camera...

1183
01:47:39,722 --> 01:47:42,923
有機會當攝影師
and a chance to become
a photographer.

1184
01:47:42,958 --> 01:47:45,897
小心狗屎
Watch out for the dog shit.

1185
01:47:45,670 --> 01:47:49,564
而且現在才剛入夜
Not to mention that
the night was still young...

1186
01:47:49,770 --> 01:47:52,663
想吃東西嗎？
不了
-Want something to eat?
-No thank you, ma'am.

1187
01:47:52,698 --> 01:47:59,040
不吃？也不喝？
來根大麻煙？
Nothing to eat? Nothing to drink?
A joint?

1188
01:47:59,075 --> 01:48:02,077
試試看
Try this...

1189
01:48:20,868 --> 01:48:22,995
該睡覺了
It’s time to go to sleep.

1190
01:48:25,038 --> 01:48:27,559
我帶你進房
I’ll show you your bed.

1191
01:48:27,594 --> 01:48:34,303
－有，你沒洗過熱水澡？你有熱水吧？
-You have hot water, don’t you?
You’ve never taken a hot shower?
-Yes.

1192
01:48:34,338 --> 01:48:37,259
-沒有 -那怎麼辦？
-No.
-What do you do?

1193
01:48:37,294 --> 01:48:39,632
我們都用水壺燒
We heat up the kettle.

1194
01:48:39,667 --> 01:48:45,128
你幹嘛杵著？
我睡哪一間？
-Why are you standing there?
-What room do I sleep in?

1195
01:48:44,458 --> 01:48:50,590
Unfortunately, there’s only one room.
很不幸的只有一間 你得跟我睡
You have to sleep with me.

1196
01:48:50,625 --> 01:48:54,460
我就不多談我的初體驗了
I won’t go into the details
of my first sexual experience.

1197
01:48:54,668 --> 01:48:57,584
放輕鬆
Just relax...

1198
01:48:57,619 --> 01:49:00,272
因為在另一邊
Because, elsewhere...

1199
01:48:59,638 --> 01:49:05,372
對貧民區更重要的事正在上演
another more important sex scene
for the ghetto was taking place.

1200
01:49:05,726 --> 01:49:11,710
紅毛一槍未開就救走帥奈德
Carrot was helping
Knockout Ned escape...
without firing a shot.

1201
01:49:12,232 --> 01:49:19,149
守衛忙著任護士擺佈
The policeman guarding him was
in the willing hands of the nurse.

1202
01:49:16,610 --> 01:49:20,918
在此同時，為了除掉紅毛
And in the meantime...

1203
01:49:20,604 --> 01:49:24,529
小霸王正斥資買軍火
to eliminate Carrot, Li’l Z'
was investing in munitions.

1204
01:49:24,197 --> 01:49:27,721
手筆很大…不過他付不起
even if he couldn’t pay...
He invested heavily,

1205
01:49:27,992 --> 01:49:32,851
記得雙管槍嗎？
我已經有了
-Remember the double-barrel?
-I already have it.

1206
01:49:32,371 --> 01:49:37,138
This is a repeater rifle. You don’t have
這是自動步槍 你沒有白朗寧
this one, the Browning.

1207
01:49:36,696 --> 01:49:40,436
-射飛機都行
-我又不射飛機
-It’ll shoot down a plane.
-I’m not shooting down planes.

1208
01:49:40,646 --> 01:49:43,945
，我要的貨呢？AR-15步槍
And the one I asked for?
The AR-15, Uncle Sam.

1209
01:49:43,980 --> 01:49:47,583
巴西弄不到
You can’t get them in Brazil.

1210
01:49:47,618 --> 01:49:49,777
屁啦
My ass, Uncle Sam.

1211
01:49:52,104 --> 01:49:54,954
我有辦法
I have a solution.

1212
01:49:54,156 --> 01:49:56,855
看過魯格槍嗎？
The Rugger. Ever seen one?

1213
01:49:56,383 --> 01:50:01,590
口徑一樣，只是比較輕
It’s like the AR-15.
Same caliber, but lighter.

1214
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:04,558
有紅外線瞄準？四百連發？
With an infrared sight?
400 shots a minute?

1215
01:50:04,593 --> 01:50:12,581
-看情況
-看你個頭，你想耍我？
-It depends.
-It depends, my ass!
Trying to fuck me over?

1216
01:50:11,343 --> 01:50:16,313
I’ll fuck you over first.
我先整死你 你給我空手離開
You leave now without the money
or the guns.

1217
01:50:16,493 --> 01:50:20,454
-那是你的事
-那我怎麼交待？
-That’s your problem.
-What do I tell the boss?

1218
01:50:20,489 --> 01:50:24,416
-你自己想
-你聽到了，出去
-You’ll think of something.
-You heard him, chubby? Get out.

1219
01:50:24,451 --> 01:50:27,184
滾啊，肥豬
Beat it, fatso.

1220
01:50:27,219 --> 01:50:29,918
小霸王犯了大錯
Li’l Z' had made a big mistake.

1221
01:50:30,129 --> 01:50:34,429
售貨員背後都有供應商
He should have known that behind
every salesman lies a supplier.

1222
01:50:34,464 --> 01:50:37,190
他們可不好惹
And they don't joke around.

1223
01:50:37,437 --> 01:50:40,930
這個你看過嗎？
Have you seen this?

1224
01:50:40,606 --> 01:50:43,742
他們要AR-15幹嘛？
What do they need an AR-15 for?

1225
01:50:43,777 --> 01:50:46,560
警方會被迫調查
These stories will push
the police to investigate.

1226
01:50:46,595 --> 01:50:49,343
你被捉，我也會遭殃
They’ll nab you.
And me, along with you.

1227
01:50:49,548 --> 01:50:54,178
我不會招出你
Think I’m going
to give you away?

1228
01:50:56,642 --> 01:50:59,950
放心，我會處理
Don’t worry,
I’ll take care of it.

1229
01:50:59,516 --> 01:51:02,320
別再搞砸了
But don’t fuck up again.

1230
01:51:08,402 --> 01:51:11,262
查理
Charlie!

1231
01:51:11,171 --> 01:51:13,870
過來
Come here!

1232
01:51:14,072 --> 01:51:18,537
聽著，你告訴他…
Listen...
you tell him...

1233
01:51:19,311 --> 01:51:23,441
去找那個混蛋算帳
Let’s go make that sleazy
little dealer pay up.

1234
01:51:33,695 --> 01:51:37,825
小子們，過來
Come here, kids!

1235
01:51:38,114 --> 01:51:42,791
-喜歡吃雞肉嗎？ -看情形
-Do you like chicken?
-It depends.

1236
01:51:42,293 --> 01:51:46,402
我們先吃雞，再拿紅毛當甜點
We’ll eat some chicken
and have Carrot for dessert.

1237
01:51:46,437 --> 01:51:49,938
我有禮物要送你們
I have a present for you.

1238
01:51:51,126 --> 01:51:53,705
拿去
Here...

1239
01:51:54,605 --> 01:51:57,538
這支給你
A big one for you.

1240
01:51:56,832 --> 01:51:59,774
真的要送我們？
Are you really giving us
these guns?

1241
01:51:59,023 --> 01:52:04,718
對，但你們得幫我對付紅毛
Yes, but I want you on my side,
against Carrot.

1242
01:52:04,753 --> 01:52:06,016
然後就可以搶劫？
Then can we hold up
anyone we want?

1243
01:52:06,051 --> 01:52:10,555
不能搶貧民區
-會用槍嗎？ -會一點
Not in the ghetto.
Can you shoot?

1244
01:52:10,762 --> 01:52:11,896
會一點？
-More or less.
-More or less?

1245
01:52:11,931 --> 01:52:18,225
喂，過來教教他們
Hey, you guys, come help
these kids.

1246
01:52:19,167 --> 01:52:21,729
我知道，就是這樣
I know. You do it like this.

1247
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:30,279
（結束的開始）
THE BEGINNING OF THE END

1248
01:52:38,991 --> 01:52:39,980
捉住那只雞
Get that chicken!

1249
01:52:52,637 --> 01:52:54,466
快點
C'mon, let’s go.

1250
01:52:54,134 --> 01:52:56,659
小霸王會宰了你
If Li’l Z' catches you,
he'll kill you.

1251
01:52:57,856 --> 01:53:01,477
他得先找到我
Yeah, well, he's gotta
find me first.

1252
01:53:09,354 --> 01:53:12,619
小子，捉住那只雞
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!

1253
01:53:14,417 --> 01:53:16,750
媽的，條子
Shit! The cops!

1254
01:53:16,754 --> 01:53:18,925
不准跑
Hell, don't fucking run off!

1255
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:21,096
給我
Give me that.

1256
01:53:31,465 --> 01:53:34,753
梅隆海，娘娘腔
Hey, Melonhead! You fucking fag!

1257
01:53:34,788 --> 01:53:38,315
給我滾出去
Get the hell out of here!

1258
01:53:38,350 --> 01:53:41,843
懦夫
混蛋
Coward!
Asshole!

1259
01:53:42,042 --> 01:53:45,723
走吧，讓他們自相殘殺
Come on, let them kill each other.

1260
01:53:45,924 --> 01:53:48,654
讓他們去死
They can fuck themselves.

1261
01:53:56,802 --> 01:53:59,293
阿炮，幫我們照相
Rocket! Take a picture of us!

1262
01:53:59,716 --> 01:54:03,004
你還等什麼？
What are you waiting for?

1263
01:54:23,862 --> 01:54:26,359
怎麼回事？
What’s happening?

1264
01:54:26,732 --> 01:54:28,131
媽的
Shit!

1265
01:54:31,690 --> 01:54:43,113
我們走
Let’s go!

1266
01:54:49,503 --> 01:55:17,809
快跑…
Run! Run!

1267
01:55:18,016 --> 01:55:24,078
殺了他們，轟了他
Watch out!
Kill one of these faggots!
Blast him!

1268
01:55:43,742 --> 01:55:59,428
帥奈德
Knockout Ned!

1269
01:55:59,958 --> 01:56:02,756
小心，別動
Take it easy. Don’t move.

1270
01:56:02,791 --> 01:56:05,123
好痛
It hurts, man.

1271
01:56:05,158 --> 01:56:07,456
別使力
Easy does it, kid.

1272
01:56:07,506 --> 01:56:11,129
你為何加入火拼？
Why did you join this fucking war?

1273
01:56:11,336 --> 01:56:14,467
帥奈德

-What's your name?

1276
01:56:38,997 --> 01:56:41,989
我想幹掉殺父仇人
I want to get my father’s murderer.

1277
01:57:06,591 --> 01:57:09,059
Knockout Ned! Li’l Z’ has been hit.
Come on!

1278
01:57:10,428 --> 01:57:14,762
等我來救你，撐住
I’ll help you.
Just hold on there.

1279
01:57:52,925 --> 01:57:57,238
條子來了
The fucking cops!

1280
01:57:57,442 --> 01:57:58,526
趴下
On the ground!

1281
01:57:58,561 --> 01:58:00,977
-別動 -手放在頭上
-Hands over your head.
-Don't move!

1282
01:58:09,220 --> 01:58:15,523
-我就是要捉你 -你完了，老兄
-You’re the one I want.
-You’re finished, pal.

1283
01:58:15,727 --> 01:58:17,786
銬住他
Handcuff him.

1284
01:58:34,779 --> 01:58:36,337
你要去哪裡？
Rocket, where are you going?

1285
01:58:36,548 --> 01:58:39,016
有件事我想搞清楚
I got something to clear up.

1286
01:59:10,415 --> 01:59:11,939
還好嗎？
Okay, lovebirds?

1287
01:59:12,150 --> 01:59:20,784
走吧，我們去算帳 你不必，你要給媒體拍
Come on, Li’l Z',
let’s go settle our scores.
Not you. You’re a present
for the media.

1288
01:59:56,895 --> 01:59:58,328
有1萬嗎？
Does it come to 10,000?

1289
01:59:58,530 --> 02:00:01,848
差不多，我只有這些
Almost. That’s all I have.

1290
02:00:01,883 --> 02:00:05,167
只有這些，我們搜過了
-That’s all there was, Chief.
-We searched everywhere.

1291
02:00:05,370 --> 02:00:07,861
放了他
Let him go.

1292
02:00:12,277 --> 02:00:15,178
這個戒指是金的嗎？
What about this ring?
Is it gold?

1293
02:00:15,380 --> 02:00:21,285
把錢裝滿，其他先欠著
Fill it up. You’ll owe us
the rest.

1294
02:00:24,165 --> 02:00:27,286
拼什麼拼
Fucking war!

1295
02:00:28,792 --> 02:00:32,087
奈德死了，我破產
Knockout Ned is dead
and I'm dead broke!

1296
02:00:32,122 --> 02:00:34,075
你玩完了？
You're fucked, eh?

1297
02:00:34,110 --> 02:00:36,028
小子們
Kids...

1298
02:00:36,234 --> 02:00:40,136
我們得搶幾個錢重振旗鼓
we’ll have to do a few hold-ups
to get my business going again.

1299
02:00:40,338 --> 02:00:43,273
-你想重振旗鼓？
-你有意見嗎？
-Your business, Li’l Z’?

這是替我們的朋友報仇
This is for our friend,
motherfucker!

1301

變天囉

1302
02:00:54,155 --> 02:00:58,121
該我們當家了
The business is ours!

1303
02:01:51,109 --> 02:01:56,210
這張可以讓我拿高薪
This picture of the hood
will get me the job.

1304
02:01:57,616 --> 02:02:00,499
這張能讓我成名

1305
02:02:00,534 --> 02:02:03,382
甚至登上雜誌封面
It’ll even make the cover
of a magazine.

1306
02:02:04,782 --> 02:02:09,285
我不必擔心小霸王了
I won’t have to worry
about Li’l Z' anymore.

1307
02:02:10,210 --> 02:02:13,925
但條子呢？
But the cops?

1308
02:02:21,272 --> 02:02:25,709
※自封天主之城領袖的流氓§ ※遭人射殺§

1309
02:02:28,146 --> 02:02:32,742
這張照片會害死我們？
This photo could’ve gotten
us killed?

1310
02:02:32,777 --> 02:02:33,694
我覺得會
I think so.

1311
02:02:33,729 --> 02:02:37,415
至少你有工作了
At least it got you a job.

1312
02:02:36,477 --> 02:02:41,456
不是工作，是實習
總有薪水吧？
-It pays a little, doesn’t it?
-Not a job, an internship.

1313
02:02:41,491 --> 02:02:43,436
一點點
A little.

1314
02:02:43,471 --> 02:02:47,331
那個女記者夠辣嗎？
What about that lady journalist?
Was she a good lay?

1315
02:02:46,719 --> 02:02:49,898
-還好吧 -你不喜歡？
-You didn’t like it?
-More or less.

1316
02:02:49,662 --> 02:02:52,535
我覺得記者都很遜
I don't think journalists know how
to screw.

1317
02:02:52,737 --> 02:02:53,726
大概吧，可哥亞搶了三戶人家
Yeah, I guess so.

1318
02:02:53,938 --> 02:02:56,954
最好宰了他

-是牛肉 -殺了他

and Gringo as well.

-Let’s go. Us two, and 3 others...

就這麼決定
It’s a deal.

1324
02:03:09,947 --> 02:03:13,649
你們聽過紅衛兵嗎？
Have you heard

沒有，不過來了照殺
No, but if they come,
we’ll kill them.

1326

雷諾欠我錢
Leonard, too, he owes me money.

1330
02:03:29,917 --> 02:03:32,676
中國佬自以為性感
he thinks he’s hot stuff.
And China-Man,

1331
02:03:32,283 --> 02:03:35,869
-巨人呢？
-還有克勞帝歐
-Where’s Giant?
-And Claudio.

1332
02:03:35,904 --> 02:03:38,810
巨人，快點
Come on, Giant!

1333
02:03:52,324 --> 02:03:56,927
我忘了說，我現在不叫阿炮
I forgot to say,
my name isn't Rocket anymore.

1334
02:03:56,829 --> 02:04:01,265

他就會殺了他們

he'll kill them.

1342
02:04:46,084 --> 02:04:47,984
警方都不管嗎?
The police don’t go in there?

1343
02:04:48,186 --> 02:04:53,556
他們捉我，不捉他
They go after me, not him.
