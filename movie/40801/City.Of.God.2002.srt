1
00:00:49,762 --> 00:00:51,559
上帝之城
City of god

2
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:58,359
该死  那只鸡跑了  快追啊  伙计们
Fuck, the chicken's got away! go after that chicken, man!

3
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:03,162
快点  该死的
Go on, for fuck's sake!

4
00:02:07,273 --> 00:02:09,400
抓住那只鸡
Get that chicken!

5
00:02:23,356 --> 00:02:26,052
如果拍张好照片  我就能在报社找到工作
If it's a good photo, I'll get a job at the paper.

6
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:28,419
-你这么想  芝麻菜  -值得一试
- You think so, Rocket? - Gotta take the risk.

7
00:02:28,627 --> 00:02:33,257
你为了一张照片就不要命吗  算了吧 
You'd risk your life for a picture? forget it!

8
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:37,166
你以为我想看见那些混蛋
You think I want to meet up with that motherfucking hood?

9
00:02:38,204 --> 00:02:42,072
抓住那只鸡  老兄
Get that chicken, bro!

10
00:02:44,343 --> 00:02:47,369
混蛋  我叫你抓住那只鸡
Motherfucker! I told you to grab that chicken!

11
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,707
滚开
Out of my way!

12
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:51,917
抓住那只鸡
Get that chicken!

13
00:03:11,537 --> 00:03:13,266
如果里尔泽抓住你  会杀了你的
If Li'l ze  catches you, he'll kill you.

14
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:17,905
是啊  他得先找到我再说 
Yeah, well, he's gotta find me first.

15
00:03:26,852 --> 00:03:30,481
小孩  抓住那只鸡  抓住它
Hey, kid! get that chicken! get that chicken!

16
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:34,356
该死  警察
Shit! the cops!

17
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,824
别他妈逃跑
Don't fucking run off!

18
00:03:37,029 --> 00:03:38,826
给我枪
Give me that.

19
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,901
傻瓜  你真他妈碍事
Hey, melonhead! you fucking fag!

20
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,461
一张照片就可以改变我的一生  但是
A picture could change my life, but...

21
00:03:47,673 --> 00:03:50,938
在上帝之城  如果你要逃跑  他们会抓你
In the city of god, if you run away, they get you...

22
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:55,002
-你不跑也会抓你  -他们是来抓我们的
- And if you stay, they get you too. - They’re coming for us!

23
00:03:55,214 --> 00:03:57,876
小时候就是这样
It's been that way ever since I was a kid...

24
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:04,521
六十年代
The sixties

25
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:12,863
你真没用  伙计
You’re useless, man!

26
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:15,898
-把球捡回来  -废物一个
- Go get the ball! - Fucking useless!

27
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:20,198
孩子们
Hey, kid!

28
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:23,432
把球给我  我玩玩
Give me the ball, I wanna play.

29
00:04:25,244 --> 00:04:28,771
-这不是你的  -你敢招惹我
- It's not yours. - You wanna mess with me?

30
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:31,415
滚开
Fuck off.

31
00:04:31,617 --> 00:04:35,781
-你叫什么名字  -抱歉  忘记介绍我自己了
- What's your name? - Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself.

32
00:04:35,988 --> 00:04:38,513
-我叫芝麻菜  -给你点建议  芝麻菜
- My name’s Rocket. - Some advice, Rocket...

33
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,288
不要让小傻子拿球  他球技很差
Don’t let li'l dice touch that ball. he sucks.

34
00:04:42,795 --> 00:04:44,786
-抢到了  伙计  -快跑  三毛
- You lose, pal. - Go, Shaggy!

35
00:04:44,997 --> 00:04:47,227
这就是三毛
That's Shaggy.

36
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:50,834
关于上帝之城的故事  我要从他开始讲起
To tell the story of the city of god, I have to start with him.

37
00:04:51,036 --> 00:04:53,061
8, 9, 10, 11...
8, 9, 10, 11...

38
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,316
但是要讲三毛的故事
But in order to tell shaggy's story,

39
00:04:56,316 --> 00:04:58,743
我就得先讲少年三人帮的故事
I must tell the story of the Tender Trio.

40
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:03,142
三毛  气罐车就要来了  你还在磨蹭什么
Well, Shaggy? the gas truck’s coming. what are you fucking around for?

41
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:05,283
是不是害怕了
You’re not gonna chicken out...

42
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:12,148
少年三人帮的故事
The story of the Tender Trio

43
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,650
臭名昭著的少年三人帮
The notorious Tender Trio

44
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:21,288
在上帝之城是个传奇
was legendary in the city of god.

45
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,058
三毛...
Shaggy...

46
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:25,430
剪刀...
Clipper...

47
00:05:26,105 --> 00:05:27,572
还有阿呆
And Goose

48
00:05:29,508 --> 00:05:33,239
小骰子和傻蛋总是尾随其后
Tagging along were always Li'l Dice and Benny...

49
00:05:33,445 --> 00:05:35,379
他是三毛的弟弟
Shaggy's brother.

50
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:40,312
我从来都不敢跟着我的哥哥  阿呆
I never had the courage to follow my brother, Goose.

51
00:05:48,894 --> 00:05:50,862
好  我们走
Okay, let's go.

52
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,657
快点  阿呆
Come on, Goose.

53
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:55,423
我们上
Let's go!

54
00:06:05,411 --> 00:06:07,379
停下  停下  该死的停下
Stop! stop! stop this fucker!

55
00:06:12,151 --> 00:06:15,985
停下  不然我就开枪了  混蛋
Stop or I'll shoot, motherfucker!

56
00:06:16,188 --> 00:06:18,486
滚出来
Get out!

57
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:23,954
快点  蠢猪  交出钱来
Hurry up, asshole! gimme the money!

58
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,824
谁要煤气
Who wants gas?

59
00:06:35,407 --> 00:06:38,934
再掏  为了老板的钱  你不要命了吗  
More! You wanna die for your boss damn money?

60
00:06:39,144 --> 00:06:41,135
这里有好多钱
Shitloads of money here!

61
00:06:43,282 --> 00:06:45,580
看到了吗  蠢猪
You see, asshole?

62
00:06:46,585 --> 00:06:47,745
蠢猪
Asshole!

63
00:06:47,953 --> 00:06:49,921
该死  警察来了
Fuck! the cops!

64
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:55,352
快跑
Let's get out of here!

65
00:06:59,398 --> 00:07:03,129
快跑  这里全是警察
Clear out! the place is crawling with cops!

66
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:22,148
-三毛  -接球  阿呆 
- Shaggy! - The ball, Goose, it's yours!

67
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:34,692
那时候  我认为少年三人帮的那些人
Back then, I thought the guys in the Tender Trio...

68
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,061
是里约热内卢最坏的家伙
Were the most dangerous hoods in Rio.

69
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:40,705
给  买些新球
Here! buy some new balls.

70
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:45,709
但是他们只是不成熟
But they were just amateurs.

71
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,656
连我的哥哥阿呆也是
Even my brother, Goose.

72
00:07:50,657 --> 00:07:52,573
芝麻菜  把这些钱给爸爸
Rocket, give this money to dad.

73
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,052
但别说是我给的
But don't tell him it's from me.

74
00:07:57,256 --> 00:07:59,486
好吗
Okay?

75
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:02,684
-线头  -怎么了
- Hey, Stringy! - Yeah?

76
00:08:02,895 --> 00:08:05,159
看我有这么多钱
Look how much I've got.

77
00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:25,379
我们来到上帝之城  希望这里是乐土
We came to the city of god hoping to find paradise.

78
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:30,248
由于洪水和贫民窟的纵火
Many families were homeless due to flooding...

79
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:32,856
很多家庭都流离失所
And acts of arson in the ghettos.

80
00:08:33,058 --> 00:08:35,993
-一个电线杆  -我们要通电了
- A light post! - We'll have electricity!

81
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:38,356
政府领导人可不是开玩笑
The bigwigs in government didn't joke around.

82
00:08:38,564 --> 00:08:41,499
无家可归  就去上帝之城
Homeless? off to city of god!

83
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,761
那里没有电  没有柏油路和交通工具
There was no electricity, paved streets or transportation.

84
00:08:45,971 --> 00:08:49,168
但对有钱有势的人来说  我们的问题不重要
But for the rich and powerful our problems didn't matter.

85
00:08:49,408 --> 00:08:52,377
这里和海报中的里约热内卢
We were too far removed...

86
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:55,046
差距太大了
From the picture postcard image of rio de janeiro.

87
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:14,494
你觉得将来我会成为救生员吗
Do you think I can become a lifeguard one day?

88
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,531
我不知道
I don’t know.

89
00:09:16,735 --> 00:09:19,602
救生员总比卖鱼的好
Being a lifeguard is better than a fishmonger.

90
00:09:19,805 --> 00:09:22,330
我不想卖鱼  太臭了
I don’t want to sell fish. it stinks.

91
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,241
-你在侮辱你爸爸吗  -没有
- Are you insulting your father? - No.

92
00:09:25,978 --> 00:09:28,947
你将来想做什么
So what do you want to be?

93
00:09:29,348 --> 00:09:30,975
我不知道
I don’t know.

94
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,777
-不做流氓也不做警察  -为什么
- Not a hood or a policeman. - Why not?

95
00:09:34,987 --> 00:09:37,148
我怕被枪打死
I'm scared of getting shot.

96
00:09:41,627 --> 00:09:44,095
把那个拿一边去  小破孩  你缺心眼啊
Put that thing away, kid. Are you nuts?

97
00:09:44,296 --> 00:09:47,788
拿枪指着我
Pointing that gun at me?

98
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,231
没事的  阿呆  小骰子跟我来的  
Take it easy with the kid, Goose. Li'l Dice is with me.

99
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:54,270
对  我也是个匪徒
Right, I'm a gangster too.

100
00:09:54,473 --> 00:09:57,101
-抢燃气卡车赚得太少了  -那干啥
- That gas truck didn't bring much. - So what?

101
00:09:57,309 --> 00:10:00,938
-我们每天都抢劫气罐车  -今天一个  明天一个
- We rob gas trucks every day. - One today, another tomorrow.

102
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,441
不  我们应该去抢些富人
No, we need to rob some rich guy's house.

103
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:06,083
那是唯一逃离这里的方法
That's the only way to get out of here.

104
00:10:06,285 --> 00:10:09,584
该死  不要  你们只要按我的计划办就行
Hell, no. What you need is to follow my plan.

105
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:11,221
看看
That's it.

106
00:10:11,423 --> 00:10:15,519
这小子开始不知道天高地厚了
The little fart's getting too big for his britches!

107
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:24,834
他抽多了  开始胡说八道
He gets high and starts talking bullshit.

108
00:10:25,037 --> 00:10:30,202
你俩瘾君子连这孩子的一半都不如
You two junkies aren't worth half as much as that kid.

109
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,070
小骰子你有什么主意
What you got in mind, Li'l Dice?

110
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,876
想成为真正流氓光有枪是不够的  要有思想
To be a real hood you need more than just a gun. you need ideas.

111
00:10:43,088 --> 00:10:45,181
小骰子就拥有这思想
And Li'l Dice had them.

112
00:10:46,358 --> 00:10:48,849
-那是旅馆吗  -是
- Is that the motel? - Yeah.

113
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:53,994
我们进去抢钱就出来  别杀人  明白吗
We go in, grab the money and get out. No killing, got that?

114
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:57,532
-我要这把枪  -别动我的枪  臭小子
- I need this. - Don't touch my gun, kid.

115
00:10:57,736 --> 00:10:58,930
再也不准动
Don't ever do that again.

116
00:10:59,137 --> 00:11:00,729
-别指着我  -去你妈的
- Don't point at me. - Fuck you.

117
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:04,602
-别拿手指我  -别胡闹了
- Don't point your finger at me! - Stop acting like a baby!

118
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,504
这个给你
Here's yours.

119
00:11:06,712 --> 00:11:09,112
-太棒了  -我们走
- Awesome! - Let’s go!

120
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:11,839
-别那么快  -怎么了
- Not so fast! - What?

121
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,518
你留在这儿  放哨
You stay here and keep watch.

122
00:11:14,786 --> 00:11:20,088
如果警察来了  用枪打那个窗户
If the cops come, shoot that window over there.

123
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:23,193
-为什么我放哨  让那个傻瓜做  -听着
- Why me? Let that dork do that. - Look...

124
00:11:23,395 --> 00:11:25,928
我免费给你提供计划
I gave you this great plan, for free...

125
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:28,594
而那个家伙纯粹废物一个
... while that guy's absolutely useless!

126
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,563
-是你的主意  -当然
- You just had the idea. - Exactly!

127
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:33,260
记住你还是个孩子
You're just a kid, remember?

128
00:11:33,872 --> 00:11:36,602
你为我们放哨好吗
You cover us, okay?

129
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:42,376
会有机会的  所以不要了太心急
You'll get your turn, so cool it. stop trying to rush things.

130
00:11:42,581 --> 00:11:45,072
你留在这儿
You stay there.

131
00:11:48,887 --> 00:11:52,015
抢劫  婊子
This is a hold-up, bitch.

132
00:11:55,127 --> 00:12:01,794
你应该学习或者工作  你看着就不像流氓
You should be studying or working. You don't even look like hoodlums.

133
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,993
所以  你应该工作或者学习  孩子
Instead, you ought to be working or studying, boy.

134
00:12:06,204 --> 00:12:09,071
闭嘴  真烦人 
Shut up! what a pain in the ass!

135
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:11,805
好了吗  剪刀
Okay, Clipper?

136
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:15,244
我们进去吗
Shall we go in?

137
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:22,850
我没叫东西
I didn't order anything.

138
00:12:23,055 --> 00:12:27,185
免费给的  先生  拿出钱来
It's on the house, sir. Hand over the money!

139
00:12:27,392 --> 00:12:29,656
冷静  我只要钱
Keep calm, all I want is your cash.

140
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:31,453
-别开枪  -你的钱包
- Don’t point that... - Your wallet...

141
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,399
老兄
Hey, man...

142
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:47,806
这是什么妓院啊
What kind of whorehouse is this?

143
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:53,609
-你是教堂的吗  -是的  兄弟
- You from the church? - Yes, brother.

144
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:57,677
给我
Give it to me!

145
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:01,188
荡妇
Slut!

146
00:13:01,426 --> 00:13:03,223
你这又老又肥的家伙
You're old, fat and flabby!

147
00:13:04,196 --> 00:13:06,494
想占她便宜吗
Wanna take her place?

148
00:13:10,969 --> 00:13:13,130
怎么了
What's going on?

149
00:13:14,272 --> 00:13:16,968
-警察来了  快撤  -快走
- The cops! let's beat it! - Let's go!

150
00:13:22,114 --> 00:13:25,606
开那辆车  我去找小骰子
Take that car. I'll go get Li'l Dice.

151
00:13:26,985 --> 00:13:29,419
天  真是辆好车 
Jesus, what a car!

152
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,912
有点不对劲  小骰子不见了
Something fucked up. Li'l Dice's gone.

153
00:13:37,912 --> 00:13:40,161
警察开枪了  快走吧
The cops are shooting, Let's go!

154
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:09,592
慢点  等一下
Slow down! hold on...

155
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:12,628
-你说过你会开车的  -我会  别紧张
- You said you knew how to drive. - I do, so cool it!

156
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:15,527
转弯  小心
Turn! watch out!

157
00:14:29,147 --> 00:14:30,910
你个蠢猪
You fucking asshole!

158
00:14:31,983 --> 00:14:34,679
我不是故意的
Hey, I didn't do it on purpose.

159
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:38,515
谁也没看见  闭上你的臭嘴  懂吗
No one saw anything. so keep your mouths shut, understand?

160
00:14:42,294 --> 00:14:45,195
等一下  我脚扭了
Hold on, I twisted my ankle.

161
00:14:45,397 --> 00:14:47,729
阿呆  看看他的脚
Goose fucked up his ankle.

162
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:48,922
疼死了
It fucking hurts.

163
00:14:49,134 --> 00:14:53,036
带他进树林  我开枪调开警察
Take him into the woods. I'll shoot to distract the cops.

164
00:14:53,238 --> 00:14:55,570
-上帝保佑  -上帝保佑
- In God we trust. - In God we trust.

165
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:02,743
给我电话  企鹅
Pass me the telephone, Penguin.

166
00:15:02,948 --> 00:15:06,850
矮子是上帝之城另一个臭名远扬的家伙
Shorty is another notorious guy in the city of god.

167
00:15:07,052 --> 00:15:09,077
但还没到讲他的故事的时候
But it's not yet time to tell his story.

168
00:15:10,955 --> 00:15:14,982
-阿呆  真他妈疼死我了  -闭嘴 
- It fucking hurts, goose. - Shut up.

169
00:15:15,694 --> 00:15:20,427
-等等  -你像个女孩似的  活计
- Wait up... - You sound like a damn sissy, man.

170
00:15:24,502 --> 00:15:27,767
-伸手  爬上来  -没人看见
- Give me your hand! climb up! - No one saw anything?

171
00:15:27,972 --> 00:15:32,807
真奇怪  一辆车撞进酒吧  没有人看见
How odd! A car crashes into a bar and no one saw a thing.

172
00:15:33,011 --> 00:15:36,003
你们真的什么也没看见吗
I suppose you didn’t see anything either?

173
00:15:36,214 --> 00:15:39,945
和以前一样  没人看见  没人知道
As usual, no one saw, no one knows.

174
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:44,143
怎么了  矮子
So what's up, Shorty?

175
00:15:44,823 --> 00:15:47,587
他们藏在树林里
They're hiding in the woods.

176
00:15:48,593 --> 00:15:50,254
-你好  傻瓜  -你好吗
- Hello, melonhead. - How are you doing?

177
00:15:50,462 --> 00:15:53,898
我感觉他们已经逃进树林了
I have this feeling that they're out in the woods.

178
00:15:54,132 --> 00:15:57,693
-该死的混蛋  -他们逃进树林里
- The motherfuckers. - They’re out in the woods.

179
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,633
飞利浦  检查一下车  兰热尔  跟我走
Felipe, lock up the car. Rangel, come with me.

180
00:16:06,044 --> 00:16:09,309
我什么也看不见  他们怎么能看见
I can't see a thing. How the hell can they see?

181
00:16:09,514 --> 00:16:11,948
该死的树林
Fucking jungle.

182
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:20,282
-他们在旅馆抢劫了  -我知道
- They stole a fortune at that motel. - I know.

183
00:16:22,627 --> 00:16:25,289
如果我们找到钱怎么办
What if we took the money?

184
00:16:25,797 --> 00:16:29,961
你疯了  我不想掺和
Are you crazy? I'm not getting mixed up in that.

185
00:16:30,168 --> 00:16:32,728
我想消灭这些家伙
I want to exterminate these guys.

186
00:16:32,937 --> 00:16:37,237
为什么  从黑人和罪犯那里偷钱也是犯罪吗
What? since when is stealing from niggers and thieves a crime?

187
00:16:37,575 --> 00:16:44,242
逮住他们并不困难  我在上帝之城有个线人
It won't be hard to nab them. I have a stoolie in the city.

188
00:17:09,107 --> 00:17:15,774
-你听见那些枪声了吗  -我抓住一个就杀一个
- Did you hear those shots? - If I catch one of them, I'll kill him.

189
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:29,049
马拉卡纳
Maracana!

190
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,555
开门
Open the door.

191
00:17:33,832 --> 00:17:37,563
-怎么了  -条子追我
- What's the matter? - The cops are after me.

192
00:17:45,944 --> 00:17:47,343
三毛
Shaggy!

193
00:17:48,546 --> 00:17:51,413
-三毛  -警察追上来了
- Shaggy! - The cops are on my ass!

194
00:17:51,616 --> 00:17:54,847
-让我躲一躲  -快  进来
- Hide me! - Quick, come in.

195
00:18:02,694 --> 00:18:07,028
该死  我以为警察会一晚上都呆在那里
Shit... I thought the cops would be down there all night.

196
00:18:08,366 --> 00:18:11,267
我有理想  阿呆
I had a vision, Goose.

197
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:14,733
你抽了啥了
You been smoking something?

198
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:17,906
-你有工作对不对  -是的
- You've had a job, right? - Yeah.

199
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:20,168
什么工作  别人怎么看 
What's it like? What do people say?

200
00:18:20,378 --> 00:18:22,505
我给我爸工作
I worked with my father.

201
00:18:22,714 --> 00:18:26,275
我爸说很多废话
And fathers talk a lot of shit.

202
00:18:27,518 --> 00:18:29,330
知道吗  阿呆 
You know what, Goose?

203
00:18:29,331 --> 00:18:31,545
我想退出了  我不想死
I'm getting out, I don't want to die.

204
00:18:31,756 --> 00:18:34,876
流氓的生活  不太适合我
This gangster’s life isn't for me.

205
00:18:34,877 --> 00:18:37,021
等等  警察还在下面
Wait! the cops are still down there.

206
00:18:37,362 --> 00:18:40,024
我不在乎
I don't give a shit.

207
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,862
我要回教堂了
I'm going back to the church.

208
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,563
他住在最高的隐蔽之处
He that dwells in the secret place of the most High...

209
00:18:47,772 --> 00:18:51,139
拥有全能大显之力  我说的是耶和华
Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the lord...

210
00:18:51,342 --> 00:18:55,608
他是我的庇护神  避难所  相信上帝
He is my refuge and my fortress, in him will I trust.

211
00:18:55,813 --> 00:18:59,044
你必不怕黑夜的惊骇  或白天的飞箭  
Fear not the terror by night, nor the arrow that flies by day...

212
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,277
也不怕黑暗中的罪恶  不怕毁灭
Nor the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor the destruction...

213
00:19:03,488 --> 00:19:07,356
-站住  混蛋  -别动
- Stop, motherfucker! - don't move!

214
00:19:07,692 --> 00:19:11,128
站住  再跑我开枪了
Stop, or I'll shoot!

215
00:19:12,764 --> 00:19:17,792
拥有全能大显之力
...shall abide under the shadow of the almighty.

216
00:19:18,002 --> 00:19:20,489
在旅馆的抢劫平静下来
The hold-up at the motel went down

217
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,769
成为历史上最血腥的杀戮
as the bloodiest in history.

218
00:19:22,974 --> 00:19:25,807
歹徒们命运却不同
The destinies of the outlaws then took different paths.

219
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:29,446
我觉得这家伙不是抢劫犯
I don't think this guy was involved in the heist.

220
00:19:29,647 --> 00:19:31,342
看看这
See here?

221
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:36,953
-他是个工人不是流氓  -我现在把他变成流氓
- He's a worker, not a hoodlum. - I'll make him one now.

222
00:19:40,224 --> 00:19:44,524
命运将剪刀带回上帝的手里
Destiny put Clipper back into the hands of god.

223
00:19:46,064 --> 00:19:50,228
三毛在波妮丝的手里
Shaggy was in Bernice's hands.

224
00:19:51,869 --> 00:19:55,396
阿呆在爸爸手里
And Goose was in my father's hands.

225
00:19:55,606 --> 00:19:59,098
你为什么要那样  你以为我傻吗
Why do you do these things? you think I'm a fool?

226
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,006
从现在开始  你要给我干活儿
From now on, you'll work with me.

227
00:20:02,213 --> 00:20:06,377
你弟弟会看着你
Your younger brother will keep an eye on you.

228
00:20:06,584 --> 00:20:08,575
听着
You listen to me.

229
00:20:08,786 --> 00:20:13,155
如果我发现你有歪财  我就杀了你
If I catch you with money that isn't yours, I'll kill you.

230
00:20:13,358 --> 00:20:19,228
你也一样  换衣服  马上去工作
That goes for you too. get changed! you start work immediately.

231
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:25,198
有个流氓哥哥很糟糕  永远都是你买单
Having a hood as a brother sucks. you always end up footing the bill.

232
00:20:25,403 --> 00:20:29,669
不要担心  爸爸是生我的气
Don't worry. dad's mad at me...

233
00:20:29,874 --> 00:20:34,277
但很快就没事的
But he'll get over it.

234
00:20:37,415 --> 00:20:41,476
给我  芝麻菜  这不是你干的  你要学习
Give me that, Rocket. it's not for you. you have to study.

235
00:20:41,686 --> 00:20:45,019
-中枪你也不害怕吗  -我是流氓因为我很笨
- Getting shot doesn't scare you? -I'm a hood because I got no brain.

236
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:49,057
但是你很聪明  你应该好好学习
But you're smart. you should study.

237
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,859
我上学是因为我不喜欢体力劳动
I go to school because I don't like physical work.

238
00:20:53,398 --> 00:20:57,994
向我保证  你永远不碰这枪  发誓
Promise me something... that you'll never touch this gun. promise?

239
00:20:58,736 --> 00:21:00,795
握握手
Let's shake.

240
00:21:02,306 --> 00:21:04,866
我们最好快点
We'd better hurry.

241
00:21:06,144 --> 00:21:09,671
还有很多鱼要卖  别笑了
I'm gonna sell a lot of fish. and don't laugh.

242
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:11,644
我挨打的时候你笑了
You grinned when I got slapped.

243
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:13,749
-谁  我  -我看见了
- Who, me? - I saw you.

244
00:21:41,712 --> 00:21:45,204
怎么了  三毛  猫咬你舌头了吗
What is it, Shaggy? Cat got your tongue?

245
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,010
你坐立不安的让我也很紧张
Your fidgeting behind me makes me nervous.

246
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:52,383
-我在想该怎么给你说  -你也会想吗
- I'm thinking of what to say to you. - You’re thinking, as well?

247
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,922
别想了  你不擅长思考
Don't. It'll be your downfall.

248
00:21:55,126 --> 00:21:59,392
我的心有所属  那人就是你
My heart has chosen you. and I follow my heart.

249
00:21:59,597 --> 00:22:02,031
你跟我开玩笑吗
Are you pulling my leg?

250
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:05,396
你没听说过一见钟情吗
You never heard of love at first sight?

251
00:22:06,037 --> 00:22:09,033
流氓们不懂爱  只有欲望
Hoods don't love, they desire.

252
00:22:09,034 --> 00:22:11,031
我只要说话你就反驳我
You cut down everything I say.

253
00:22:11,242 --> 00:22:14,939
流氓们不聊天  他们只会花言巧语  
Hoods don't talk, they smooth-talk.

254
00:22:15,146 --> 00:22:18,479
算了  我还是别浪费口舌了
Well, I'll stop wasting my breath on you.

255
00:22:18,683 --> 00:22:22,210
流氓不会罢手  只会暂停
Hoods don't stop, they take a break.

256
00:22:23,221 --> 00:22:25,712
跟你谈爱情确实很复杂
Talking to you about love sure is complicated.

257
00:22:25,923 --> 00:22:29,450
这不是爱情  是骗局
It's not love, it's a con game.

258
00:22:45,743 --> 00:22:48,177
只是  我爱你
It's just that I love you.

259
00:22:49,213 --> 00:22:52,808
你还是别说服我了
You just might end up convincing me...

260
00:23:14,805 --> 00:23:19,799
抢劫之后  警察们不断来贫民窟搜查
After the hold-up, there were constant police raids in the ghetto.

261
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:31,315
每天都有人进监狱  有人被逮捕 
Every day, someone went to jail, someone was nailed.

262
00:23:33,157 --> 00:23:37,218
但没人看见什么  也没人知道什么
But no one had seen anything. no one knew anything.

263
00:23:38,629 --> 00:23:43,999
没人像警察告密说小偷藏在什么地方
No one blabbed to the cops about where the thieves were hiding out.

264
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,304
3个月后
3 months later

265
00:23:48,506 --> 00:23:49,666
三毛
Shaggy...

266
00:23:49,874 --> 00:23:53,207
为什么不改变一下你的生活
Why don't you change your life?

267
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:57,375
找个工作而不是整天躺在床上
Get a job instead of lying around in bed all day.

268
00:23:57,582 --> 00:24:00,415
-无所事事  -你什么意思
- Good-for-nothing! - What do you mean?

269
00:24:00,618 --> 00:24:03,587
你觉得工作可以挣钱  那就去啊 
You think you can make money working? go ahead.

270
00:24:04,255 --> 00:24:08,658
没错  三毛  我整天工作怎么你啦
That's right, Shaggy... What do you think I do all day?

271
00:24:11,596 --> 00:24:14,151
别生气  亲爱的
Take it easy, baby... 

272
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:17,728
你知道就是想和你在一起生孩子
you know all I want is to be with you, have kids...

273
00:24:17,935 --> 00:24:22,497
有个农场  养鸡  种大麻  富裕起来
And a farm, raise chickens, grow pot and get high.

274
00:24:22,707 --> 00:24:26,575
你的话对我来说就是花言巧语
Sure! for me, that's nothing but smooth-talk.

275
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:40,753
什么  我差点就因为那个旅馆发财了
What? I almost got rich with that motel job.

276
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:41,947
你开玩笑吧
Are you kidding?

277
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,726
警察们还在为旅馆的谋杀找你们  
The cops are still looking for you because of the deaths in the motel.

278
00:24:48,199 --> 00:24:51,066
谋杀  你说什么
What deaths? what are you talking about?

279
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:54,727
你看见啦  你知道个屁  闭嘴
Did you see anything? you don't know shit, so shut up.

280
00:24:54,939 --> 00:24:58,067
你没在场  我一个人都没杀
You weren't there. I didn't kill anyone.

281
00:24:58,276 --> 00:25:01,973
我打赌是那些警察杀的  让我来背黑锅
I bet it's those fucking policemen, and I'm the one taking the rap.

282
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:05,808
他们甚至逮捕了小骰子  所以别再提了
They even nabbed Li'l Dice. So don't bring it up again!

283
00:25:07,285 --> 00:25:10,083
-我不管是谁杀的  -反正不是我
- I don't care who did it. - It wasn’t me.

284
00:25:10,288 --> 00:25:14,554
我这么说吧  我不想孩子他爸是个流氓
Let me just say... I don't want my kid's father to be a hoodlum.

285
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:16,158
你现在是一个人了  三毛
You're all alone, Shaggy.

286
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,916
-一个人  -没错
- All alone? - That's right!

287
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:20,259
-剪刀信教了 -哈利路亚
- Clipper's gone religious. - Hallelujah!

288
00:25:20,464 --> 00:25:22,159
-阿呆在工作 -马屁精
- Goose is working. - Ass-kisser!

289
00:25:22,366 --> 00:25:24,493
-而你呢   -我没变  那又怎样?
- And you? - I haven't changed. So what?

290
00:25:24,702 --> 00:25:29,002
是他们背弃我
They've deserted me, that’s all.

291
00:25:29,206 --> 00:25:31,367
那我也要背弃你
Then I'm deserting you too.

292
00:25:31,575 --> 00:25:34,066
我要离开这里  三毛  你要想的话我们一起走
I'm splitting, Shaggy. Come with me, if you want.

293
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:38,146
否则我自己走
Otherwise, I'll go alone.

294
00:25:52,196 --> 00:25:54,824
卖鱼啦

295
00:25:55,032 --> 00:25:58,001
我哥答应不再鬼混
My brother had promised to stop messing around.

296
00:25:58,202 --> 00:26:04,670
但流氓从不罢休  只会暂停
But a hood doesn't stop, a hood takes a break.

297
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:08,174
阿呆搞上了矮子的老婆
Goose began messing around with Shorty's wife.

298

有鳟鱼  但为你这样的特别顾客

那是乌鱼
Hey, that's a mullet!

301
00:26:21,592 --> 00:26:25,754
你老公会替你口交吗?
Doesn't your husband...go down on you?

302
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:28,455
不会
No.

303
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,996
我老公都会在进入之前帮我口交半小时
Mine, before entering me, has to use his tongue.

304
00:26:32,203 --> 00:26:36,867
你有让他肛交吗
For about half an hour.And from behind? Do you let him?

305
00:26:37,074 --> 00:26:42,273
-当然没有  不会痛吗 -前几次会
- Good God, no. Doesn't it hurt? - The first few times.

306
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,211
之后可爽了  不过得准备香蕉
Then you'll see, it's fantastic. But you need a banana.

307
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:47,907
干什么
What for?

308
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:51,111
你真不懂得享乐
You’re missing the good things in life, girl!

309
00:26:51,322 --> 00:26:54,390
拿根香蕉  加热
You take a banana, warm it up...

Put it up your thing, while he takes you from behind.

311
00:26:58,362 --> 00:27:02,560
爽死了  问你老公这么干
It's a real rush!  Ask your husband.

312
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:07,534
不行  你不了解他  他八成会揍我
I couldn't. You don't know him. He's liable to beat me.

313
00:27:07,738 --> 00:27:11,435
试试看  男人最爱这种花招

when I was 16. Like all poor people,I started at the bottom...

382
00:34:01,652 --> 00:34:04,120

- So? I'm not jealous. -Her father's a sergeant.

391

人都有缺点  往中间靠
No one's perfect. Closer together!

392
00:34:37,252 --> 00:34:39,516
我是这票朋友里的摄影师
I was the official photographer of our gang.

393

394
00:34:52,901 --> 00:34:56,098
蒂亚戈  往后一点
Thiago, move back a little.

395
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:59,102
-这样行吗  -很好
- Is this okay? - Perfect.

396
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:09,081
我想抽大麻
I need a joint.

397
00:35:09,284 --> 00:35:14,051
别抽了  现在流行吸白粉
Instead of smoking, man,  you should snort coke. It's far out.

398
00:35:14,256 --> 00:35:20,227
你有在吸  蒂亚戈  我比较喜欢大麻
You snort, Thiago? I prefer a good toke.

399
00:35:20,228 --> 00:35:23,697
你要想抽的话  我可以帮你弄到货
If you like, I can get it for you.

400
00:35:23,698 --> 00:35:28,328
是吗  那就快去
You can? Then go on, move your ass!

401
00:35:28,536 --> 00:35:32,302
但白粉才好  那是真正的醉麻剂
But the choice stuff is coke. That's a real nercotic.

402
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:34,839
是麻醉剂
Narcotic!

403
00:35:37,145 --> 00:35:41,710
-你的嘴好咸  蒂亚戈  -去你的
- Your mouth is all salty, Thiago. - Screw you.

404
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:44,145
线头  你想当救生员
You want to be a lifeguard, Stringy?

405
00:35:44,352 --> 00:35:46,843
-你从不下水 -我爸爸是救生员
- You're never in the water. - My dad's a lifeguard.

406
00:35:47,055 --> 00:35:50,991
-赌一罐啤酒我比你游得好  -赌了
- I'll bet you a beer I swim better. - You're on.

407
00:35:53,795 --> 00:35:57,595
如果你要  我可以去找黑仔弄一根大麻
If you like, I can go get you a joint at Blacky’s.

408
00:36:10,645 --> 00:36:13,705
我愿意做任何事来取悦她
I'd have done anything to please her...

409
00:36:14,849 --> 00:36:17,409
给她买大麻  白粉
Buy her pot, coke...

410
00:36:21,623 --> 00:36:27,228
我可以去找大哥  用低价买到好货
I could go to the top dogs to buy quality stuff at a good price...

411
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:34,498
因为大哥黑仔是我的老同学
because the local boss was a former classmate: Blacky.

412
00:36:36,004 --> 00:36:38,974
-谁  -芝麻菜
-Who is it?  -Rocket.

413
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:45,175
-最近咋样  -很好

414
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,473
-其他人呢  -也很好

415
00:36:47,682 --> 00:36:49,582
-你想买还是抽  -买

416

Come in, buddy.

417
00:36:56,124 --> 00:37:00,618
是谁
Who is it?

418
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,600
这是黑仔的地盘
This was Blacky's turf.

419
00:37:07,802 --> 00:37:11,397
但原本也不是他的
But it hadn't always been his.

420
00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:16,576
-黑仔  -靠  小骰子啊 
- Hey, Blacky.  - Fuck, Li'l Dice.

421
00:37:16,611 --> 00:37:21,343
-来我这里还带人  -谁说这里是你的
- You show up like this at my place?  - Who said it was your place?

422
00:37:22,384 --> 00:37:24,886
(这间公寓的故事)
THE STORY OF THE APARTMENT

423
00:37:24,887 --> 00:37:27,845
齐利亚太太守寡之后开始贩毒
Dona Zelia began selling drugs here...

424
00:37:28,056 --> 00:37:32,049
好养活她的女儿
when her husband died, in order to raise her daughters.

425
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:37,664
她会送毒品给为她服务的男孩
She also gave away drugs to boys at times in return for special favors.

426
00:37:37,866 --> 00:37:43,566
她最喜欢大个儿  后来大个儿长大了
Her favorite was "Big Boy". One day, he grew very big!

427
00:37:43,772 --> 00:37:48,835
齐利亚太外行  三两下就被取代
Zelia's operation was so amateur that he had no trouble seizing it from her.

428
00:37:49,744 --> 00:37:54,238
大个儿利用青少年贩毒
Big Boy used the neighborhood kids as dealers.

429
00:37:54,783 --> 00:37:59,225
-我那份大麻呢  -去你妈的
- What about my pot? - Stick it up your ass.

430
00:37:59,354 --> 00:38:02,118
最会做生意的…
The best dealer...

431
00:38:03,758 --> 00:38:06,591
是萝卜
...was Carrot.

432
00:38:06,795 --> 00:38:09,423
-我可以喝一口吗  -喝吧
- Can I have a sip? - Sure.

433
00:38:09,631 --> 00:38:12,259
他赢得大个儿的信任
He earned Big Boy's trust...

434
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:15,459
被升为经理
was promoted, and moved up to become a manager.

435
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:19,333
黑仔  我们20你5  好吧 
Blacky, 20 for us and 5 for you, okay?

436
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:23,776
有一天萝卜的朋友跑来
One day a buddy of Carrot's showed up.

437
00:38:23,978 --> 00:38:30,100
-他叫亚里斯多德  -我老婆要手术
- His name was Aristotle.  - My wife needs an operation.

438
00:38:30,118 --> 00:38:36,455
他们家在萝卜落魄时收留他
His family had taken Carrot in when he was down and out.

439
00:38:36,658 --> 00:38:39,422
兄弟有难  他不能不帮
He couldn't refuse to help a brother in need.

440
00:38:39,627 --> 00:38:44,064
这是货  周五之前交钱
Here’s the dope. I want the dough no later than Friday.

441
00:38:44,265 --> 00:38:47,098
-兄弟  你救了我一命  -周五交钱
- You've bailed me out, brother. - Friday.

442
00:38:47,702 --> 00:38:51,536
他就像我的亲兄弟  大个儿
He's my buddy, practically my brother, Big Boy.

443
00:38:51,739 --> 00:38:55,732
再给他一星期
Give him another week.

444
00:38:57,946 --> 00:39:02,797
-你不杀他  我就杀你  -萝卜别无选择
- Either you kill him, or I'll kill you. - Carrot had no choice.

445
00:39:04,152 --> 00:39:08,680
-我说了周五  -兄弟  别开枪
- I said Friday. - Don’t do it, man.

446
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:12,485
萝卜想杀了大个儿  不过不必
Carrot wanted to kill Big Boy, but it wasn't necessary.

447
00:39:12,927 --> 00:39:17,217
大个儿没收买条子  死在狱中
Big Boy hadn't paid off the cops. He died in jail.

448
00:39:20,168 --> 00:39:23,695
萝卜接收了大个儿的一切
Carrot took everything that belonged to Big Boy...

449
00:39:23,905 --> 00:39:27,741
但房子他不要  不吉利
but didn't want the apartment...

450
00:39:27,742 --> 00:39:31,812
他把它送给亲信黑仔
the place was ill-fated. Carrot gave it to his most trusted dealer...

451
00:39:31,813 --> 00:39:34,684
-给你  150袋  -黑仔
- Here. 150 bags. - Blacky.

452
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:36,876
多给一点  这的毒品这么多
Give me more. This place is crawling with druggies.

453
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:40,350
于是他就这样接收了这个地盘
That's how he took over the local trade.

454
00:39:40,555 --> 00:39:43,575
但为时并不久
But not for long...

455
00:39:44,025 --> 00:39:46,289
谁
Who is it?

456
00:39:46,494 --> 00:39:48,359
去看看
Go see.

457
00:39:59,307 --> 00:40:01,298
-黑仔  -靠  小骰子 
- Hey, Blacky. -Fuck, Li'l Dice.

458
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:05,550
-来我这里还带人  -谁说这里是你的
- You show up like this at my place? -Who said it was your place?

459
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,447
是啊  谁说的
Yeah, who?

460
00:40:13,655 --> 00:40:15,555
-小骰子  怎么了  -去你的
-Something wrong, Li'l Dice?  -Li'l Dice, my ass.

461
00:40:15,757 --> 00:40:18,021
什么小骰子  我现在叫里尔泽
My name is Li'l Z' now.

462
00:40:18,226 --> 00:40:20,626
(里尔泽的故事)
THE STORY OF LI'L Z'

463
00:40:20,828 --> 00:40:23,854
里尔泽从还叫小骰子的时候
Li'l Z' had always wanted to be boss of the City of God...

464
00:40:24,065 --> 00:40:28,399
就想当上帝之城的老大
ever since he was little and was called "Li'l Dice".

465
00:40:32,206 --> 00:40:35,826
他们爽了  不让我过瘾
They're having fun, and not me?

466
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,550
我想离开这
I want to get out of here.

467
00:40:48,356 --> 00:40:52,617
干什么  你朋友抢过了  你还想怎样
What, kid? Your friend took  everything. What do you want?

468
00:40:58,566 --> 00:41:01,831
那一晚  小骰子满足了杀人的渴望
That night, Li'l Dice satisfied his thirst to kill...

469
00:41:02,036 --> 00:41:04,561
尽管他知道三毛不会放过他
though he knew Shaggy would never forgive him.

470
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:16,246
他离开上帝之城躲避惩罚
To avoid being punished he left the City of God.

471
00:41:17,452 --> 00:41:20,182
辛苦工作赚钱
He had to work hard for peanuts.

472
00:41:25,293 --> 00:41:29,077
-干得好  傻蛋  -小骰子和傻蛋混得不错
- Yeah, Benny! - Li'l Dice and Benny managed well.

473
00:41:30,498 --> 00:41:32,261
他们有犯罪天份
They had the gift of crime.

474
00:41:32,467 --> 00:41:35,471
-你拿得比我多  -我出的主意
- You have more money than me. - It was my idea.

475
00:41:35,506 --> 00:41:38,599
他们只怕遇见大流氓
The only problem was running into an older hoodlum...

476
00:41:38,806 --> 00:41:42,144
-像我哥阿呆  -小骰子
...like my brother, Goose. -Li'l Dice?

477
00:41:42,243 --> 00:41:45,576
妈的  我以为你在旅馆挂了
Shit, man. I thought you were a goner at the motel.

478
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,476
你真他妈有钱
You're fucking loaded!

479
00:41:48,683 --> 00:41:52,346
别给他  傻蛋  那是我们的
Don't, Benny. That's our money.

480
00:41:52,887 --> 00:41:55,656
傻蛋  告诉你哥三毛 
Benny, tell your brother Shaggy...

481
00:41:55,691 --> 00:42:03,086
矮子告密了  我要离开贫民区
I'm leaving the ghetto. that Shorty is squealing.

482
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:06,032
阿呆
Goose!

483
00:42:06,301 --> 00:42:11,898
这是三毛的  带着吧
From Shaggy. You'll need it.

484
00:42:31,926 --> 00:42:34,554
小骰子在杀人的日子里长大
From one hit to the next, Li'l Dice grew up.

485
00:42:34,762 --> 00:42:39,165
18岁就成了上帝之城里最受敬畏的混混
At 18, he was the most respected hood in the City of God.

486
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:41,426
你成年了  小心了
You're of age now, watch out!

487
00:42:41,636 --> 00:42:44,935
和里约热内卢头号通缉犯之一
He was one of the most wanted robbers in Rio.

488
00:42:58,219 --> 00:42:59,880
小骰子  你好吗
Li'l Dice, how's it going?

489
00:43:00,088 --> 00:43:03,717
生日快乐  恭喜你成年
Happy birthday.  I'm so glad you've turned 18...

490
00:43:03,925 --> 00:43:07,156
-滚开  -抱歉  朋友
- Get lost, Tuba! - Excuse me, amigo...

491
00:43:07,795 --> 00:43:09,862
给我啤酒
Give me a beer!

492
00:43:10,064 --> 00:43:11,663
混蛋  你没看到我吗
Didn't you see me, prick?

493
00:43:11,698 --> 00:43:15,766
-对不起  活计  -你妈的
- Sorry, man.  - Up yours!

494
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:19,337
下次不会轻饶你的  混蛋
The next time, I'll waste you, asshole!

495
00:43:23,111 --> 00:43:26,046
小骰子已经做好了准备
Li'l Dice was ready for anything.

496
00:43:26,247 --> 00:43:28,181
我有话要说
I wanna talk.

497
00:43:28,382 --> 00:43:31,900
-他急欲大展身手  -这儿哪几只羊最肥
- And he was itching to start.  - Who are the fattest cats here?

500
00:43:40,561 --> 00:43:42,756
你看佩拉和他的妞
Look at Pereira and the chick he's with...

501
00:43:42,964 --> 00:43:47,360
-贝妮丝  她跟过我哥  -你看他的车
- Bernice. She was my brother's girl. - Check out his car.

- They're all dealers. - They're all fucking loaded.

506
00:44:01,949 --> 00:44:03,974
抢劫钱太少
Hold-ups bring in chickenshit.

507
00:44:04,185 --> 00:44:06,983
-毒品才有赚头 -我懂了

-但那要本钱  -不一定

510
00:44:11,859 --> 00:44:15,556
直接杀了这些小丑接手他们的生意

511
00:44:15,763 --> 00:44:18,527
-什么时候开始  -马上

512
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:32,001
恶魔指点明路

513
00:44:32,213 --> 00:44:34,807
把你带来
He brought you here.

514
00:44:35,016 --> 00:44:40,215
为何留在被上帝遗忘的上帝之城
Why remain in the City of God where God has forgotten you?

515
00:44:41,088 --> 00:44:45,491
我知道你要什么  你想要力量

我有东西可以让你如愿

但你不能亵渎它
But you mustn't fornicate with the amulet...

519
00:44:59,874 --> 00:45:05,811
否则你会死  另外
you'll die. otherwise...

520
00:45:06,314 --> 00:45:10,907
你不再是小骰子  而是里尔泽  
Li'l Dice... but Li'l Z'. The boy is no longer called

521
00:45:11,118 --> 00:45:14,679
里尔泽会长大
Li'l Z' will grow up.

522
00:45:14,989 --> 00:45:18,789
你追随我  我就保佑你
You stick with me, I'll stick with you.

523
00:45:30,071 --> 00:45:33,529
小骰子就变成了里尔泽  大开杀戒
Li'l Dice became Li'l Z' and he began to kill.

524
00:45:33,972 --> 00:45:42,000
某个早上  他抢了杰瑞・阿德里亚尼的生意
He started one morning, taking over Jerry Adriani's racket.

525
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:46,819
到了晚上  他几乎并吞了全城的生意
By that night, almost all of the rackets in the ghetto were his.

526
00:45:47,021 --> 00:45:50,422
但是他没有动萝卜  因为萝卜是傻蛋的朋友
The only business he didn't touch was Carrot's...

527
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:56,640
只剩下这层公寓  不过好办
since he was a friend of Benny's. All that was left was the apartment... But that would be easy.

528
00:46:00,635 --> 00:46:03,695
谁
Who is it?

529
00:46:10,444 --> 00:46:12,309
-黑仔  -靠  是小骰子 
-Hey, Blacky. -Fuck, Li'l Dice.

530
00:46:12,513 --> 00:46:18,645
-来我这里还带人  -谁说这里是你的
- You show up like this at my place? - Who said it was your place?

531
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,993
-小骰子  怎么了  -去你的  什么小骰子
-Something wrong, Li'l Dice? -Li'l Dice, my ass.

532
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:24,146
-我现在叫里尔泽了  -他叫里尔泽  知道了吗
- My name is Li'l Z' now. - His name's Li'l Z', see?

533
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:27,486
-你完蛋了  -别杀他  他明白事理
- You're a goner, bastard. -Don't kill him. He understands.

534
00:46:27,695 --> 00:46:29,822
对吧  黑仔
Right, Blacky?

535
00:46:30,031 --> 00:46:33,964
都给你  我啥都不要  我不想惹麻烦
It's all yours, I don't want anything. I don't want no trouble, okay?

536
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:37,897
我应该趁机替我哥报仇
I should have taken this chance to avenge my brother's death.

537
00:46:39,774 --> 00:46:44,631
饶你一命替我们工作  懂吗
You'll live, but you'll work for us. Understand?

538
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:46,772
但说得容易
That's easy to say...

539
00:46:48,115 --> 00:46:51,312
-你要去哪里  -不关他的事  里尔泽
- Where are you going? -He's clean, Li'l Z'.

540
00:46:51,886 --> 00:46:53,319
你叫什么  小屁孩儿 
What's your name, kid?

541
00:46:53,521 --> 00:46:57,321
-芝麻菜  -他是阿呆的弟弟
-Rocket. -He's Goose's brother.

542
00:46:57,525 --> 00:47:00,119
-阿呆  -死掉的阿呆
-Goose? -The late Goose.

543
00:47:01,329 --> 00:47:03,593
你走吧
Quick, kid. Run along.

544
00:47:03,798 --> 00:47:08,258
告诉大家现在由我里尔泽当家
Tell everyone that this business now belongs to Li'l Z'.

545
00:47:08,469 --> 00:47:12,371
我们会卖白粉  懂吗
And that we'll be selling coke. Got that?

546
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,469
可卡因
Cocaine.

547
00:47:17,478 --> 00:47:20,413
-堂口在哪里  -前边  左侧 
- Where's the turf? -Over there, on the left.

548
00:47:20,614 --> 00:47:23,640
贩毒就像其他生意
Selling drugs is like any other business.

549
00:47:23,985 --> 00:47:25,885
供应商提供货品 
The supplier delivers the merchandise...

550
00:47:26,087 --> 00:47:28,817
然后包装
which is then packaged on the premises.

551
00:47:29,156 --> 00:47:32,956
在装配线上包装
It's done in an assembly line.

552
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:39,723
枯燥得很  大麻卷成一卷
Boring as hell... Pot is wrapped up in "lids".

553
00:47:40,001 --> 00:47:42,697
可卡因则装成小包
Cocaine is put into packets...

554
00:47:43,437 --> 00:47:47,669
十包或百包为一袋
and then into bundles of 10 or 100.

555
00:47:48,042 --> 00:47:50,909
贩毒甚至可以当事业
You can even make a career in dealing drugs.

556
00:47:51,112 --> 00:47:54,946
让小孩子去送货
The kids start out as delivery boys.

557
00:47:55,216 --> 00:47:59,209
刚开始当跑腿传话的
They're paid to run errands and take messages.

558
00:47:59,954 --> 00:48:02,946
然后再升为看风的  警察一来
Then they become lookouts. if the police arrive...

559
00:48:03,157 --> 00:48:05,990
他们就把风筝放跑  大家撒腿就跑
the kites disappear and everyone scrams

560
00:48:07,261 --> 00:48:09,292
再然后  就可以去卖货
Later, you become a dealer 

561
00:48:09,293 --> 00:48:10,856
或称之为蒸汽
or a "vapor".

562
00:48:11,065 --> 00:48:14,159
温度一高  蒸汽立刻就不见 
When the heat's on, the "vapor" quickly evaporates.

563
00:48:14,368 --> 00:48:18,498
再往上升  就可以有枪了
Moving up the ladder, you have the "soldier".

564
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:22,334
要是数学好的话  还可以当管家
And if the guy is good at math, he can become a manager...

565
00:48:22,543 --> 00:48:26,001
是老大的左膀右臂
The boss' right-hand man.

566
00:48:27,448 --> 00:48:31,384
警察也从中得到好处  不找他们麻烦
The police receive their part and don't  make trouble.

567
00:48:33,587 --> 00:48:36,181
自从里尔泽把他的对头都干光了
Since Li'l Z' killed off all of his enemies...

568
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:39,167
上帝之城就再也没有暴力事件了
There were no shoot-outs in the city of god.

569
00:48:39,168 --> 00:48:41,350
你可以放心地开车去那里
You could drive there...

570
00:48:41,729 --> 00:48:45,256
公子哥们在那儿买毒品都觉得很安全
The playboys felt safe buying their drugs there.

571
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:51,364
吸毒的人纷纷前来  里尔泽捞了一大把钱
Tthe city teemed with addicts and Li'l Z' grew rich.

572
00:48:52,306 --> 00:48:54,604
-这样行吗  -成交
- Is it okay? - It's a deal.

573
00:48:58,279 --> 00:49:02,306
-我都不知道该戴哪个了  -这个好
- I can't decide which to wear. - This one's cool.

574
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:04,554
要是贩毒合法的话 
If dealing were legal, 

575
00:49:04,555 --> 00:49:07,519
里尔泽准是年度风云人物人物
Li'l Z' would have been man of the year.

576
00:49:10,791 --> 00:49:13,726
但这对我来说却是个麻烦  我很怕他
But things were risky for me. I was afraid of him.

577
00:49:13,928 --> 00:49:18,126
-而他却无处不在  -真他妈讨厌
- and he was everywhere. - What a drag this guy is.

578
00:49:18,332 --> 00:49:23,463
每次想要大麻  我都得去找萝卜
Whenever I wanted to smoke a joint I had to go see Carrot.

579
00:49:28,075 --> 00:49:30,976
半包  谢谢
Half a lid. Thanks.

580
00:49:32,113 --> 00:49:33,445
不过这也值
But it was worth it. 

581
00:49:33,446 --> 00:49:36,277
因为我只跟安吉莉卡一块儿吸
I only smoked with Angelica.

582
00:49:37,952 --> 00:49:40,819
她跟蒂亚戈分手了  我就上了
She and Thiago had split up, so I made my move.

583
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:46,823

- I was about to win her over... - These pictures are really great.

00:49:57,705 --> 00:50:02,938
渐沉的夕阳  空寂的海滩  长长的吻
A setting sun, a deserted beach... a long kiss...

588
00:50:03,144 --> 00:50:05,977
就是那种感觉
I was sure this was it...

589
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,171
可小混混们来了
But the runts arrived.

590
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:13,015
给我吸一口行吗
Can I have a toke?

591
00:50:18,592 --> 00:50:19,786

593
00:50:26,066 --> 00:50:29,365

那是我第一次跟小混混们接触
That was my first run in with the runts.

597

- Is it your grandfather's? - No, my dad's.

604
00:51:15,848 --> 00:51:20,148
一旦吸毒成瘾  你就栽倒毒贩子手里了
When a guy is really hooked he ends up in the hands of the dealer.

He gave away pot, paid for drinks.

652
00:55:52,158 --> 00:55:55,252
里尔泽则正好相反  他有野心
Li'l Z' was the opposite. He had one obsession:

653
00:55:55,461 --> 00:55:57,429
要当贫民窟的老大
To be the boss of the ghetto.

654
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:00,895
他想找茬抢过萝卜的生意
He wanted an excuse to take over carrot's racket.

655
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,727
-萝卜  -什么事
- Hey, carrot. - What's up?

656
00:56:02,935 --> 00:56:07,235
你不该让那些小痞子去抢劫
You shouldn't  let the runts do hold-ups in the ghetto.

657
00:56:07,807 --> 00:56:10,605
我们井水不犯河水
You look after your section, I'll  look after mine.

658
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:14,678
听清楚了吗  我去喝一杯
Got that? I'm gonna get a drink.

659
00:56:22,555 --> 00:56:27,458
-芝麻菜  你怎么样   -很好
- Hey, Rocket! how's it going? - Great.

660
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:30,720
-嗨  傻蛋  -还好吗
- Hey, Benny! - how's it going?

661
00:56:31,497 --> 00:56:34,466
-蒂亚戈  还好吗  -不错
- Hey, Thiago. how are you? - Good.

662
00:56:35,534 --> 00:56:37,001
-我去一下可以吗  -当然
- May i? - Sure...

663
00:56:37,203 --> 00:56:39,501
跳个舞好吗
Wanna dance?

664
00:56:43,009 --> 00:56:46,467
-去你家行吗  -没问题
- Is it okay at your place? - No problem.

665
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:50,342
我爸妈不在  你可以一直跟她单独相处
My parents are out. you'll  be all alone with her.

666
00:56:50,549 --> 00:56:54,952
-今晚你就可以告别处男了  -小点声
- You can lose your virginity tonight. - Not so loud, man!

667
00:56:55,154 --> 00:56:56,883
大家都会听见的
Everyone will hear.

668
00:56:58,124 --> 00:57:00,524
-你真漂亮  -谢谢
- You're beautiful. - Thank you.

669
00:57:00,726 --> 00:57:05,186
-妈的  -没戏了
- Shit! - Nothing's happening.

670
00:57:12,405 --> 00:57:16,705
我知道那些小混混是跟你混的
Look, man, I know the runts are associated with you.

671
00:57:16,909 --> 00:57:19,106
当我是白痴吗  小子
Think I'm a sucker, you little brat?

672
00:57:19,107 --> 00:57:20,572
想抢我生意是不是
you want to take my racket?

673
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:24,978
我是想跟你谈谈  你他妈太蠢了
I want to talk to you because you’re fucking useless.

674
00:57:25,184 --> 00:57:26,173
放开
Get your hand away!

675
00:57:26,385 --> 00:57:29,411
那帮小痞子会给我们惹麻烦的
The runts are screwing up our security, man.

676
00:57:29,622 --> 00:57:30,953
把奶瓶给他
Give the baby his bottle.

677
00:57:31,157 --> 00:57:33,557
萝卜  让那帮混混老实点  好吗
Carrot, just ask the kids to cool it, okay?

678
00:57:33,759 --> 00:57:35,185
萝卜是个白痴  
Carrot's useless. 

679
00:57:35,186 --> 00:57:37,160
他竟然让那帮小混混在他的地盘上抢东西
he lets the runts do hold-ups in his section.

680
00:57:37,363 --> 00:57:40,298
这会把警察招来  影响生意
The police come around and that's bad for business.

681
00:57:40,566 --> 00:57:44,161
好吧  我让他们停手  因为我喜欢你
I'll do it only because I like you.

682
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:46,164
不过你得给那孩子换换尿布
But you need to change that baby's diapers.

683
00:57:46,372 --> 00:57:50,206
我们看到底谁才是小孩
I'll show you who’s the baby...

684
00:57:50,409 --> 00:57:55,904
告诉那帮混混不许在我的地盘上抢劫强奸
Tell the kids that in my ghetto no one robs or rapes!

685
00:57:56,115 --> 00:57:57,582
怪不得你叫小Z呢
No wonder you're "Little"Z'?

686
00:58:00,753 --> 00:58:05,690
那帮小混混不守规矩
The runts were kids who didn't respect the laws of the ghetto.

687
00:58:05,891 --> 00:58:09,349
他们到人家里  到面包店里抢东西
They would mug residents, hold up bakeries...

688
00:58:09,562 --> 00:58:11,757
在萝卜的地盘尤其猖獗
Especially in Carrot's section.

689
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:18,261
你们干什么
What are you doing?

690
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:24,533
-老是抢我的东西  -可他们并不知道  
- You rob me all the time! - But they didn't know...

691
00:58:24,743 --> 00:58:27,075
上帝之城现在有老大了
That the city had a boss now.

692
00:58:28,948 --> 00:58:30,973
谢谢您选择我们 
Thank you for choosing us

693
00:58:31,183 --> 00:58:35,017
上帝之城比以前安全多了
The city had become much safer for residents.

694
00:58:36,355 --> 00:58:39,222
几乎都没有抢劫了
There were hardly any hold-ups now.

695
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:40,755
去找里尔泽就行
You just had to go see Li'l Z'.

696
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,088
-我们走  -别伤害那些孩子
- Let' go. - Don't hurt the runts.

697
00:58:44,296 --> 00:58:47,197
我不会碰他们的
I won't touch them.

698
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:52,838
-嗨  牛排  -你好啊  里尔泽
- Hi, Steak. -How's it going, Li'l Z'?

699
00:58:53,038 --> 00:58:54,610
去走走吧  牛排
wanna take a walk, Steak? 

700
00:58:54,611 --> 00:58:55,734
和你吗  等等
with you? hold on...

701
00:58:58,177 --> 00:59:01,169
妈妈  我跟朋友出去一下
Mom, I'm  going out with my friends.

702
00:59:13,626 --> 00:59:16,288
那是我吃过的最好的鸡
That's the best chicken I ever ate.

703
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:20,823
-那个老家伙吓得要死  -可怜他吗
- The old guy was scared shitless. - Feeling sorry for him?

704
00:59:21,033 --> 00:59:24,059
疯了吗
You're crazy, man!

705
00:59:32,478 --> 00:59:35,345
我们去抢银行超市什么的吧
Why not stick up a bank or a supermarket?

706
00:59:35,548 --> 00:59:38,506
那才几个钱  卖毒品才能挣大钱
peanuts. drugs are where it's at. 

707
00:59:38,507 --> 00:59:39,985
对  卖毒品
yeah, selling drugs.

708
00:59:40,186 --> 00:59:44,282
可你得先当跑腿儿的  
But you have to start out as a delivery boy.

709
00:59:44,283 --> 00:59:46,489
你愿意当跑腿的吗
you wanna be a delivery boy?

710
00:59:46,692 --> 00:59:51,925
忽悠人的  要升级需要很长时间
It's a rip off. It takes a long time to move up.

711
00:59:52,231 --> 00:59:56,565
你得等着哪个老家伙被杀了才能得到提拔
You have to wait till an older guy gets killed to move up.

712
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:58,006
我可没那个耐心 
I don't wanna wait till some guy croaks. 

713
00:59:58,007 --> 00:59:59,965
我要学里尔泽那手
I'm gonna do what Li'l Z' did.

714
01:00:00,172 --> 01:00:02,868
把他们都灭了
I'm gonna wipe them all out.

715
01:00:03,075 --> 01:00:05,908
在说我吗  小兔崽子  老大我在这呢
Talking about me, kid? the boss is here.

716
01:00:10,015 --> 01:00:11,573
回来  兔崽子
Come back, you brat!

717
01:00:15,955 --> 01:00:22,622
-这帮小子还挺快的  -跑得真快啊
- They're quick, those kids. - They run fast.

718
01:00:23,862 --> 01:00:26,763
都走了  只剩下你了  还有吗
They're all gone except you. any others?

719
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:37,002
你来替那些跑了的抵罪 
You're gonna pay for the ones that escaped.

720
01:00:37,209 --> 01:00:38,295
自己选吧  
You choose.

721
01:00:38,296 --> 01:00:41,373
是打你的手呢  还是打脚
shall I shoot you in the hand or foot?

722
01:00:41,981 --> 01:00:43,881
快选
Come on, choose!

723
01:00:44,083 --> 01:00:46,847
手还是脚
Hand or foot?

724
01:00:49,388 --> 01:00:52,118
选  快点 
Choose, for fuck's sake!

725
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:02,993
-手  -打你的小手  对吗
- Hand. - The little hand, eh?

726
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:13,970
很好
Cool.

727
01:01:15,247 --> 01:01:19,650
牛排薯条  让我们看看你的能耐
Hey, Steak'n'fries, let's see what you're made of.

728
01:01:19,852 --> 01:01:23,185
选一个干掉
Choose and then kill one of them.

729
01:01:23,389 --> 01:01:24,937
算了吧  我来  
Leave it. I'll do it. 

730
01:01:24,938 --> 01:01:27,189
一边去  喇叭  让他来
Butt out, Tuba. This is for him.

731
01:01:30,029 --> 01:01:31,860
来  牛排
Go on, Steak.

732
01:01:32,064 --> 01:01:35,500
快  选一个崩了
Go on, choose one and shoot.

733
01:01:35,701 --> 01:01:38,727
快  我可没时间等你
Come on, I haven't got all day.

734
01:01:38,937 --> 01:01:41,770
崩一个
Kill one of them.

735
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:48,104
来  牛排  我很急的
Let’s go, Steak. I’m in a hurry.

736
01:01:48,314 --> 01:01:51,681
我想看看你怎么样
I wanna see what you're made of.

737
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:02,691
干得好
Well done!

738
01:02:02,895 --> 01:02:04,123
你做到了
You did it.

739
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:07,403
我们要你了  击个掌 
You're one of us. give me five.

740
01:02:07,404 --> 01:02:10,130
很好  牛排
very good, Steak.

741
01:02:12,805 --> 01:02:17,350
起来  小畜生  滚回家去
Get up, brat. go back to your rat hole.

742
01:02:17,351 --> 01:02:19,472
不许瘸着走
without limping!

743
01:02:20,312 --> 01:02:21,847
告诉你那些小朋友们 
Tell your buddies that 

744
01:02:21,848 --> 01:02:24,612
在里尔泽的地盘上不许抢东西
no one robs in Li'l Z's ghetto.

745
01:02:24,817 --> 01:02:27,581
走  别瘸腿  听见没
Go now. and no limping, okay?

746
01:02:29,888 --> 01:02:32,118
酷  里尔泽
Cool,  Li'l Z'.

747
01:02:44,703 --> 01:02:48,366
里尔泽赢得了民心
While Li'l Z' was winning the respect of the residents...

748
01:02:48,841 --> 01:02:51,810
而傻蛋则赢得了安吉莉卡的芳心
Benny was winning angelica's heart.

749
01:02:52,344 --> 01:02:55,122
而我  依然是个处男  
As for me, I was still a virgin, 

750
01:02:55,123 --> 01:02:56,974
没钱  没女友
single and broke.

751
01:02:57,182 --> 01:02:59,446
我也没办法
I had no choice.

752
01:03:00,552 --> 01:03:03,487
窘迫的生活
SUCKER’S LIFE

753
01:03:03,689 --> 01:03:07,420
我只好去超市打工
I had to take a job in a supermarket.

754
01:03:07,626 --> 01:03:10,579
每天工作很长时间就挣一点点钱
I worked long hours for chicken feed.

755
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:12,154
我希望老板解雇我
I wanted to be laid off...

756
01:03:12,364 --> 01:03:16,391
那我就能用解雇金去买个相机了
So I could buy a camera with the severance pay.

757
01:03:17,603 --> 01:03:20,731
可天不遂人愿
But things didn't work out that way.

758
01:03:23,809 --> 01:03:26,471
-是海滩上那个人  -嗨  老兄
- It’s the guy on the beach. - Hey, bro!

759
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:29,374
-还抽那个吗  -对
- Still smoking good stuff? - Yeah.

760
01:03:29,581 --> 01:03:31,242
那哥们儿太酷了
That guy's too cool.

761
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:34,010
小子  过来  把上衣掀起来
Hey, kid. come here. Lift up your shirt.

762
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:42,391
那帮小混混  给他们机会却不要
We give these ghetto kids a chance and they don't appreciate it.

763
01:03:42,594 --> 01:03:46,086
-我的解雇金呢  -什么解雇金
- What about my severance pay? - What severance pay?

764
01:03:46,298 --> 01:03:50,257
那个该死的经理认为我是他们的同伙
That fucking manager thought I was part of the gang.

765
01:03:50,469 --> 01:03:55,634
你犯了大错  被解雇了  快滚
You're fired for serious misconduct. Get out. Immediately!

766
01:03:55,841 --> 01:03:59,299
半分钱都没拿到
I didn't get a single cent.

767
01:04:13,091 --> 01:04:15,252
这就好像上帝告诉我
It was like a message from God:

768
01:04:17,563 --> 01:04:21,397
诚实赚不来钱的  笨蛋
""honesty doesn't pay, sucker?"

769
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,865
玩玩犯罪
Flirting with crime

770
01:04:34,046 --> 01:04:37,777
车来得太晚了  我上班都晚了
The bus sure took a long time to come. I should already be at work.

771
01:04:38,584 --> 01:04:41,985
靠  把枪藏起来  你白痴吗
Shit, hide that gun. are you nuts?

772
01:04:42,187 --> 01:04:43,848
是阿呆的  坏了
It was Goose’s. It's broken anyway.

773
01:04:44,056 --> 01:04:45,280
这也不能怨我们 
It's not our fault, 

774
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:47,116
公司跑这条线的车太少了
The company runs few buses on this line.

775
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:51,955
犯错的总是别人
It's never anyone's fault. It's always someone else's.

776
01:04:52,164 --> 01:04:56,123
遭殃的可是我们这些工人  还罚我们的钱
But it's the workers who suffer. And then, they make us squeeze!

777
01:04:56,335 --> 01:04:58,462
祝您晚上愉快  夫人
Have a nice evening, ma'am.

778
01:05:00,973 --> 01:05:03,339
我认识那个男的
I know that guy.

779
01:05:03,542 --> 01:05:05,635
他也是上帝之城的  会认出我们来的
He lives in the city. He'll recognize us.

780
01:05:05,844 --> 01:05:06,551
所以呢
So? 

781
01:05:06,552 --> 01:05:08,438
我们抢钱的时候他就不会太注意了
He couldn't care less if we take his boss' money.

782
01:05:08,647 --> 01:05:10,911
好吧  上
Okay. Let's go.

783
01:05:13,819 --> 01:05:17,277
小子   你们是上帝之城的吧
Well, boys? aren’t you from the city of god?

784
01:05:17,723 --> 01:05:19,020
对
Yeah.

785
01:05:19,224 --> 01:05:22,387
你们只付一个人的钱就行
I'll let one of you through without paying.

786
01:05:26,665 --> 01:05:30,795
你们得好好学习  离开贫民区
You should study so you can get out of the ghetto.

787
01:05:31,003 --> 01:05:33,870
那儿太乱了
It's too full of cops and hoodlums.

788
01:05:34,072 --> 01:05:37,940
-你上过学吗  -上过  我还当过兵
- Did you study? - I was in school and in the army.

789
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:41,306
我还是部队最棒的神枪手呢
I was the best marksman in my barracks.

790
01:05:41,513 --> 01:05:44,038
不过退役后我只能做这样的工作了
This job was all I could find afterwards.

791
01:05:44,249 --> 01:05:48,447
我还练空手道  要是有人雇我的话
But I do karate. if I'm hired somewhere...

792
01:05:48,654 --> 01:05:50,747
我就会离开贫民区
I'll  leave the ghetto.

793
01:05:51,256 --> 01:05:55,716
-那你打架吗  -我追求爱与和平
- Do you fight, then? - I'm for peace and love.

794
01:05:56,094 --> 01:05:57,561
不过如果非打不可的话
But if I have to...

795
01:05:57,763 --> 01:06:00,561
他并不知道他要非打不可了
He didn't know he would have to.

796
01:06:00,766 --> 01:06:04,327
但还不是讲奈德的故事的时候
But not yet, it's not time to tell knockout ned's story.

797
01:06:04,903 --> 01:06:07,064
-我们该下了  -走
- We should be going. - Let's go.

798

再见
See you.

800
01:06:15,247 --> 01:06:17,977
我下不去手  他那么好
I couldn't do it. He was such a cool guy.

801
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:21,346
没错  他是格尔森的哥哥
Yeah, totally. That's Gerson's brother.

802
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:24,552
回家吧
Let's go home.

803
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:30,753
那边只有一家面包店
There's nothing here except that bakery over there.

804
01:06:30,963 --> 01:06:35,832
-怎么想  -不知道  这是抢劫
- What will you say? - I don't know. "this is a hold-up."

805

807
01:06:42,307 --> 01:06:44,070
又没抢成
That one didn't work either.

808
01:06:44,276 --> 01:06:47,609
柜台那女孩儿太骚了  还跟我调情 
The counter girl was just too foxy. And she flirted with me.

809

给我打电话好吗
Will you call me?

810
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:53,776
真不忍心拿枪对着她  她太迷人了
I ccouldn't pull a gun on her, she was too sweet.

811
01:06:53,986 --> 01:06:55,783
我也这么觉得
Yeah, I agree.

812
01:07:02,794 --> 01:07:05,763

-巴拉  -对
- To barra? - Yes.

814
01:07:07,165 --> 01:07:09,963
圣保罗来的这家伙可要倒霉了

01:07:10,168 --> 01:07:13,194

- You're a lifesaver. - That's right.

817
01:07:18,543 --> 01:07:21,944
圣保罗人都比较白痴
Because no guy from sao paulo could ever be cool.

818
01:07:29,421 --> 01:07:32,652
-尸体在这儿  -找到了  队长

823
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:06,780
不知道  没抽过
I can't say I've never tried it.

824
01:08:06,992 --> 01:08:10,120
同类相吸
The devil recognizes his own.

825

我可是卷烟的好手
I'd  always been an ace at rolling a joint.

828
01:08:23,008 --> 01:08:25,408
我要是哄女人也这么拿手的话
If I'd had the same skill with girls...

829
01:08:26,211 --> 01:08:30,375
早就不是处男了
I'd never have lost so many chances to lose my virginity.

830
01:08:32,484 --> 01:08:35,178
你真是圣保罗人的例外啊 
For a sao paulo guy you're very cool. 

831
01:08:35,179 --> 01:08:37,251

838
01:09:20,165 --> 01:09:24,693
混蛋  妈的

839
01:09:25,403 --> 01:09:28,338
你非得在这儿杀你婊子吗
Did you have to kill your chick in the ghetto?

你不会有麻烦的

845
01:09:40,118 --> 01:09:43,610
你把条子都引来了  你死定了  混蛋
The cops are everywhere because of you. you're dead meat, asshole.

谁敢在我的地盘上杀人  谁就得死
Anyone who kills in my ghetto has to die as an example.

849
01:09:52,097 --> 01:09:54,691
那是他自己的事  里尔泽
That was his business, Li'l Z'

听好了  狗娘养的  滚出贫民区去
Listen, you sonofabitch, get outta the ghetto.

851
01:09:57,702 --> 01:09:59,795
一点都不懂规矩
You showed no respect, understand?

852
01:10:03,341 --> 01:10:04,638
傻蛋
You know what, benny?

853
01:10:04,843 --> 01:10:08,404
你心太软了  养虎为患知道吗

Okay, be careful. when things calm down...

858

你可以拍些好照片
You'll take some great pictures.

916
01:17:48,705 --> 01:17:50,673
把那个给我

917
01:17:55,913 --> 01:18:02,148
-把相机还给我  -不给
- Give me back the camera! - ?o!

918
01:18:05,088 --> 01:18:11,755
你怎么啦  你疯啦
What's your problem? are you craz?

919
01:18:38,956 --> 01:18:42,517
傻蛋被他们杀了
They've killed benny!

920
01:18:44,127 --> 01:18:49,064
操  叫救护车  哪个杂种干的
Fuck! call an ambulance! Where's the motherfucker who did it?

921
01:18:49,866 --> 01:18:54,894
-傻蛋死了  -快叫医生
- Ze benny is dead. - No! call a doctor!

922
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:05,040
滚出去  贱人  都怪你
Get out of here, bitch! it's all your fault!

923
01:19:07,317 --> 01:19:09,444
杂种
Motherfucker!

924
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:35,944
萝卜在哪儿
Where's carrot?

925
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:37,807
黑仔在这里
Blacky's here.

926
01:19:40,217 --> 01:19:42,777
他有麻烦了
He's in trouble.

927
01:19:44,855 --> 01:19:46,584
我完了
I'm fucked.

928
01:19:47,057 --> 01:19:49,048
-为什么  -我完了
- Why? - I'm fucked.

929
01:19:49,259 --> 01:19:52,126
你也玩完了  我杀了傻蛋
And you are too. I think I killed Benny.

930
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:54,456
里尔泽要你的地盘
Li'l z is coming to take your place.

931
01:19:54,665 --> 01:19:56,929
我们可以抓住他  他在舞厅
We can get him, he's in the dance hall.

932
01:19:57,134 --> 01:19:58,761
你杀了傻蛋
You killed Benny?

933
01:19:58,969 --> 01:20:02,496
我没想杀他  我想杀的是里尔泽
I didn't mean to. he moved. I was aiming at li'l z?

934
01:20:02,706 --> 01:20:04,867
行了  走吧
Come on, let's go.

935
01:20:05,075 --> 01:20:07,566
黑仔
Blacky...

936
01:20:07,778 --> 01:20:10,406
你杀了上帝之城最酷的人
You killed the coolest hood in the city of god.

937
01:20:10,614 --> 01:20:12,878
我们去搞定里尔泽
Let's go get li'l z?

938
01:20:20,857 --> 01:20:22,606
萝卜知道没了傻蛋 
Carrot knew that without benny 

939
01:20:22,607 --> 01:20:25,521
除非奇迹出现才能挽救他的生意
only a miracle could save his business.

940
01:20:25,729 --> 01:20:28,823
我们死定了
We're fucked, man.

941
01:20:38,408 --> 01:20:43,710
除了上帝之城还有哪会发生这种奇迹
But what better place for a miracle to happen than in the city of god?

942
01:20:47,351 --> 01:20:49,251
看谁来了  我的小心肝
Look who's here. my sugar babe.

943
01:20:49,453 --> 01:20:51,114
-让开  -亲我一下
- Let me by. - Gimme a kiss, girl.

944
01:20:51,321 --> 01:20:55,280
请让开  你也不照照镜子
Let me by, please. have you seen what you look like?

945
01:20:57,327 --> 01:21:00,387
拜托  里尔泽
Come on, li'l z

946
01:21:08,872 --> 01:21:11,363
亲爱的  一切都好吗
Hi, honey. everything okay, baby?

947
01:21:19,015 --> 01:21:25,682
问题很简单  里尔泽太丑  帅内德很帅
The problem was simple. Li'l z' was ugly. knockout ned was handsome.

948
01:21:25,889 --> 01:21:28,921
帅内德什么妞都能泡到
Knockout ned could get any girl.

949
01:21:28,922 --> 01:21:31,953
里尔泽要么给钱要么用暴力
Li'l z' had to pay or use force

950
01:21:32,629 --> 01:21:38,598
这是一场好帅哥和坏丑男之间的决斗
It was a duel between the handsome good guy... And the ugly bad guy.

951
01:21:38,802 --> 01:21:41,362
-放开我  -享受点嘛
- Let me go! - Just enjoy it.

952
01:21:48,678 --> 01:21:54,139
反抗也没用  你是我的了
There's no use fighting. You're mine now.

953
01:21:58,388 --> 01:22:01,585
蠢货  你的妞还挺辣的
Hey, faggot, your broad's really hot!

954
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:36,188
我根本不能面对她
I can't even look her in the face now.

955
01:22:46,236 --> 01:22:49,672
那混蛋怎么不杀了我
Why didn't that fucker kill me?

956
01:22:53,777 --> 01:22:57,873
等等  我怎么没宰了那个杂种
Hold on... why didn't I kill that fucker?

957
01:22:58,381 --> 01:23:00,246
我们回去
Let's go back.

958
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:03,248
-萝卜怎么办  -以后再找他
- What about carrot? -We'll get back to him.

959
01:23:03,453 --> 01:23:04,681
你打算杀了他
You gonna kill him?

960
01:23:08,391 --> 01:23:12,452
帅内德  你的妞是个荡妇  出来  混账
Knockout ned, your chick's a slut. come out, motherfucker!

961
01:23:12,662 --> 01:23:18,100
-滚出来  孬种  -放松
- Come out, you loser! - Take it easy...

962
01:23:18,301 --> 01:23:22,431
我要出去  让我出去
I'm going out. let me go.

963
01:23:35,886 --> 01:23:37,911
格尔森  回来
Gerson! come back, son!

964
01:23:48,465 --> 01:23:52,333
跟你无关小子  我们来找你哥的
This doesn't concern you, kid. we're here for your brother.

965
01:23:52,536 --> 01:23:55,903
谈谈吧  我们来解决  我哥不爱惹是生非
Let's talk, we can work it out. my brother's a peaceful guy.

966
01:23:56,106 --> 01:23:59,303
长得帅就不把我放在眼里吗  叫他出来
Is he too good-looking to come talk to me? call him.

967
01:23:59,509 --> 01:24:00,771
他什么都没做
He hasn't done anything.

968
01:24:01,344 --> 01:24:04,643
你知道我是谁吗
You know who I am?

969
01:24:04,848 --> 01:24:07,908
-里尔泽  老兄   -他是里尔泽
- Li'l z? man. - He's li'l z?

970
01:24:08,518 --> 01:24:11,385
叫那个杂种
Call that motherfucker!

971
01:24:16,059 --> 01:24:18,926
快去
Go on, man.

972
01:24:19,462 --> 01:24:21,726
消消气  我叫他
Calm down, I'll call him.

973
01:24:55,332 --> 01:24:58,733
胳膊  我弄伤了胳膊  萝卜得等了
My arm! I hurt my arm. Carrot will have to wait.

974
01:24:58,935 --> 01:25:01,267
那孬种自找的
That loser got what he deserved.

975
01:25:01,471 --> 01:25:03,462
走吧
Let's go!

976
01:25:27,197 --> 01:25:31,133
格尔森
Gerson...

977
01:25:31,334 --> 01:25:34,929
那个混账杀了我弟
That bastard killed my brother.

978
01:25:42,879 --> 01:25:45,643
我跟他没完
I can't let that go.

979
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:02,991
-要枪吗  -儿子啊
- Want a gun? - My son...

980
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:06,600
冷静点  妈妈
Calm down, mom.

981
01:26:07,437 --> 01:26:10,304
妈
Please, mom...

982
01:26:19,115 --> 01:26:22,778
包好点  猪头
Do it right, asshole.

983
01:26:22,986 --> 01:26:23,231
只能这样
There's no other way. 

984
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,360
我怎么会被那个孬种伤到呢
How'd I let that loser hit me?

985
01:26:26,923 --> 01:26:29,391
靠  被戳了个洞
shit, that's some hole.

986
01:26:59,122 --> 01:27:02,114
-我们就跟兄弟一样  -闭嘴
- It's as if we were brothers. - Shut up.

987
01:27:02,325 --> 01:27:03,955
我们俩都被伤到手臂
Both of us hurt in the arm.

988
01:27:03,956 --> 01:27:06,853
你被弟弟砍  我被哥哥枪打中
you by one brother, me the other.

989
01:27:07,063 --> 01:27:10,863
我们要真是兄弟就搞笑了
It would be really funny if we were brothers.

990
01:27:11,067 --> 01:27:17,165
帅内德挺厉害啊  不知从哪就冒出来了
That knockout ned's not bad, eh? he came out of nowhere.

991
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:21,570
闭嘴  喇叭  你真他妈有够烦
Shut up, tuba! you're a fucking pain!

992
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:33,283
似乎上帝之城突然间有了个英雄
It was as if the city of god had suddenly found a hero.

993
01:27:33,490 --> 01:27:35,651
上帝保佑你孩子
God bless you, son.

994
01:27:35,859 --> 01:27:39,124
那小子就是在找死
That kid was just asking to be killed.

995
01:27:39,329 --> 01:27:42,025
好样的
Well done.

996
01:27:42,232 --> 01:27:45,463
干得漂亮
You did a good job.

997
01:27:45,668 --> 01:27:49,297
你最好去躲躲
You'd better go hide

998
01:27:51,908 --> 01:27:55,173
我还以为帅内德要造反呢
I thought knockout ned would start a revolution here.

999
01:27:55,378 --> 01:27:58,142
不过老天另有安排
But god had other plans.

1000
01:27:58,448 --> 01:28:02,043
牛排  毒贩子们都去哪了
Steak, where are all the dealers?

1001
01:28:02,252 --> 01:28:05,517
他们都躲起来了  里尔泽心情不好
They’re hiding. li'l z is in a bad mood.

1002
01:28:05,722 --> 01:28:09,453
把我们搞上瘾  他们自己却躲起来了
They get us hooked and then they go off and hide.

1003
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:12,890
帮我个忙  去给我搞点白粉来
Do me a favor. go get some nose candy for me.

1004
01:28:13,096 --> 01:28:14,495
我试试
I'll try.

1005
01:28:14,697 --> 01:28:18,155
跟他们说是给蒂亚戈的  别给我断货
Tell them it's for thiago, to keep my buzz going.

1006
01:28:38,754 --> 01:28:44,124
牛排薯条  去告诉萝卜
Steak'n'fries, go to carrot's and tell him...

1007
01:28:44,326 --> 01:28:49,696
里尔泽说如果你干掉帅内德  他就放过你
Li'l z' says that if you kill knockout, he'll leave you alone.

1008
01:28:50,332 --> 01:28:53,199
帅内德  你听到了吗
Hey, knockout ned. did you hear that?

1009
01:28:53,402 --> 01:28:56,064
抓住那小子
Grab the kid!

1010
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:03,906
你听到了吗  你要是不跟着我们  你就完了
You heard the boy? if you don't stick with us, you're dead.

1011
01:29:04,113 --> 01:29:07,378
我建议你加入我们  我们就是搭档了
I think you should join us. we'll be partners.

1012
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:10,985
我不贩毒
Drugs aren't my thing.

1013
01:29:11,187 --> 01:29:13,314
这是我和他之间的事
This is just something between me and him.

1014
01:29:13,522 --> 01:29:18,186
那些人狗屁都不是
Those guys aren't worth shit.

1015
01:29:18,394 --> 01:29:21,989
他们对老大言听计从
They'll do anything for power.

1016
01:29:22,198 --> 01:29:24,530
就像那小子
Like that kid.

1017
01:29:24,733 --> 01:29:28,863
他们就是机器人  和这个瘪三一样
They're all robots, like this punk here.

1018
01:29:29,071 --> 01:29:31,335
你在想什么小子
What's in your head, kid?

1019
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:33,974
难道你不觉得你毁了你自己吗
Can't you see you're wrecking your life...

1020
01:29:34,176 --> 01:29:38,408
跟着那个疯子和一群好战的蠢货
With that maniac and a bunch of trigger-happy fools?

1021
01:29:39,882 --> 01:29:43,832
你疯了吗  你还是个孩子
Are you crazy? you’re just a kid.

1022
01:29:43,833 --> 01:29:46,549
孩子  我抽大麻也吸毒
A kid? I smoke, snort...

1023
01:29:46,755 --> 01:29:50,054
我杀人越货  我是个男人
I've killed and robbed. I'm a man.

1024
01:29:50,259 --> 01:29:52,784
操  你屁也不懂
Shit, you have no idea!

1025
01:29:52,995 --> 01:29:56,226
他有他的帮派  你应该加入我们
He's attached to his gang. you should join up with us.

1026
01:29:56,432 --> 01:30:01,301
-我们应该宰了他吗  -牛排  我们得给你点颜色
- Shall we kill him? -Steak, we're going to grind you.

-我加入  -太棒了
- Okay, I accept. - Great!

1028
01:30:07,343 --> 01:30:11,439
告诉你老大  帅内德和萝卜现在是一伙了
Tell your boss that knockout ned and carrot are now in command.

1029
01:30:11,647 --> 01:30:17,847
不能滥杀无辜
No killing of innocent people.

1030
01:30:19,488 --> 01:30:22,082
我不能接受伤及无辜
I can't accept that, understand?

1031
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:26,955
行  不滥杀无辜
Okay, no innocent people.

1032
01:30:28,364 --> 01:30:33,301
牛排搞砸了
Steak fucked up!

1033
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:47,574
-有枪给我吗  -没有
- Have you a gun for me? - No...

1034
01:30:47,783 --> 01:30:51,184
我们可以从店里枪
But we can hold up a gun store.

1035
01:30:51,387 --> 01:30:53,446
那不是问题
That's no problem.

1036
01:30:53,656 --> 01:30:57,251
我什么也不想抢  我不是流氓
I don't want to hold up anything. i'm not a hoodlum.

1037
01:30:57,459 --> 01:31:00,656
这是我和他的私人恩怨
This is a personal affair between me and him, okay?

1038
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:03,594
我不是流氓
I'm not a hoodlum.

1039
01:31:05,968 --> 01:31:07,936
他上了你的妞
He raped your chick...

1040
01:31:08,137 --> 01:31:11,971
他杀了叔叔和你弟弟  他拿枪扫射了你家
Killed your uncle and brother, gunned your house...

1041
01:31:12,174 --> 01:31:15,541
你也干掉了他的人
And you killed one of his guys.

1042
01:31:19,881 --> 01:31:23,510
你要不是流氓就走吧
If you're not a hood, then get out.

1043
01:31:28,590 --> 01:31:33,027
帅内德的故事

1044
01:31:34,195 --> 01:31:36,686

战斗开始了  让我们一起来祈祷
The war's on. Let's start with a prayer.

1078
01:33:52,433 --> 01:33:56,529
我们天堂里的主是我们神圣的名字

1081
01:34:17,191 --> 01:34:19,250

li'l z' couldn't take it. he counter-attacked.

1084
01:34:30,571 --> 01:34:34,803

1091
01:35:00,068 --> 01:35:03,526
甚至不知道等待我的会是什么
Without knowing what awaited me.

1092
01:35:05,173 --> 01:35:08,142
我以报社为家
Instead of going home I'd go over to the paper.

1093
01:35:08,342 --> 01:35:11,709
工作室里一个人是从上帝之城来的

原本应该迅速的复仇行动

1104
01:35:39,674 --> 01:35:42,165
现在成了一场全面的战争

1105
01:35:47,281 --> 01:35:49,511
上帝之城一分为二

1106
01:35:49,717 --> 01:35:53,517
人们不能在两个阵营的领地之间走动
You couldn't go from one section to the other.

1107
01:35:53,721 --> 01:35:55,951
甚至不能探亲

1108
01:35:56,157 --> 01:35:59,888
警察把每个贫民区的人都当做是混混
The cops considered anyone living in the ghetto a hoodlum.

1109
01:36:00,094 --> 01:36:03,530
人们已经习惯了越战般的生活

而且志愿来送死的人越来越多

他连一个星期也待不了
He won't last a week.

1125
01:37:30,251 --> 01:37:35,086
一年之后  没人记得所有争端时如何开始的
A year later, no one remembered how it had all begun.

1126
01:37:35,289 --> 01:37:36,620

对他们双方来说

01:41:35,873 --> 01:41:37,272
给哥几个照张相
Take our picture.

1180
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:47,951
-你他妈的给整坏了  -不是我
- You fucking broke it. - It wasn't me.

1181
01:41:48,252 --> 01:41:49,719
我明白了
I found it.

1182
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:54,354
一定是被撞了一下
It has to be wound.

1183
01:41:59,163 --> 01:42:00,357
你叫啥名
What's your name?

1184
01:42:00,664 --> 01:42:01,858
芝麻菜
Rocket.

1185
01:42:02,133 --> 01:42:04,761
再来一张  芝麻菜

1186
01:42:05,035 --> 01:42:06,764

啥
What?

1188
01:42:08,572 --> 01:42:09,561
站两排  每个人都拿支枪
Two rows. Everyone with their guns.

1189
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,933
你站到外面去了  怎么回事
You're outside, for christ's sake!

1190
01:42:12,243 --> 01:42:14,677
对他说话客气点  小子
Talk to him nicely, kid.

1191
01:42:14,945 --> 01:42:18,142
对不起  请站到里面来

1192

再来一张
Another one.

1193
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:31,186
我看胶卷拍完了
I think the roll's finished.

1194
01:42:31,462 --> 01:42:32,759
那把照片给我们看
Then show us the pictures.

1195
01:42:32,963 --> 01:42:34,760
还要冲洗一下
They have to be developed.

1196
01:42:34,999 --> 01:42:36,864
啥意思
Developed?

1197
01:42:37,168 --> 01:42:39,068
得多钱
How much is it?

1198
01:42:39,370 --> 01:42:40,997
拿着这钱
Take this money.

1199
01:42:41,272 --> 01:42:43,297
然后把照片拿来
And bring back the pictures.

1200
01:42:43,607 --> 01:42:46,041
那我要把胶卷取出来
I have to remove the film.

1201
01:42:46,310 --> 01:42:49,245
相机你就拿着吧
Keep the camera.

1202
01:42:49,513 --> 01:42:51,413
傻蛋原来不就是想给你吗

1203
01:42:51,649 --> 01:42:53,344
-是你的了  -谢谢

别忘了拿照片回来

1206
01:43:10,334 --> 01:43:13,030
-皮埃尔  -什么事
- Pierre! - What?

1207
01:43:13,337 --> 01:43:15,931
能把我这个洗一下吗
Can you develop this for me?

1208
01:43:17,374 --> 01:43:20,434
不行  芝麻菜  我会惹上麻烦的
I can't, Rocket. I could get into trouble.

1209
01:43:20,744 --> 01:43:23,645
只能给报社的记者冲洗  我不想丢掉工作
It's only for the paper's reporters. I could risk my job.

1210
01:43:23,847 --> 01:43:25,041
-皮埃尔  -什么事  罗杰里奥
- Pierre? - Yes, Rogerio?

1211
01:43:25,382 --> 01:43:27,247
把这些冲出来
Develop these for me.

1212
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:29,578
这个也算里面  好吧
This one too, okay?

1213
01:43:29,753 --> 01:43:31,948
我吃午饭去了
I'm going to lunch.

1214
01:43:33,390 --> 01:43:37,156
你真走运  什么尺寸
You're lucky. What size?

1215
01:43:37,394 --> 01:43:38,258
啥
What?

1216
01:43:38,596 --> 01:43:41,064
要放大  洗多大的片
For the enlargement, what size?

1217
01:43:41,365 --> 01:43:44,801
你觉得最好就行了
Well... Whatever you think is best.

1218
01:44:09,526 --> 01:44:10,652
-这里 -谢谢
- Here. - Thanks.

1219
01:44:10,928 --> 01:44:12,327
大祸临头了
I'm in deep shit now.

1220
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:16,860
我死定了
I'm as good as dead.

1221
01:44:29,346 --> 01:44:31,576
有人判处了我的死刑
Someone had signed my death sentence.

1222
01:44:31,749 --> 01:44:35,241
我真想把揍烂那个混蛋的脸
I wanted to bash the jerk's face in.

1223
01:44:40,858 --> 01:44:43,224
你是玛丽娜吗  你偷了我的照片
Are you Marina? You stole my photos.

1224
01:44:43,527 --> 01:44:46,519
就因为你  我要死了
Because of you, I'm dead.

1225
01:44:46,797 --> 01:44:48,492
什么死什么偷的  您什么意思
Dead? Stole? What do you mean?

1226
01:44:48,632 --> 01:44:50,691
不要这么大声
Not so loud.

1227
01:44:50,901 --> 01:44:53,893
还不要大声  因为你我就要死了
Not so loud? I'll be killed because of you.

1228
01:44:54,238 --> 01:44:57,503
你走了  照片就在冲洗室里
You were gone, your photos were in the lab.

1229
01:44:57,741 --> 01:44:59,208
我什么都没干
There's nothing I can do.

1230
01:44:59,510 --> 01:45:01,205
冲洗室的照片
The photos in our lab

1231
01:45:01,512 --> 01:45:03,241
都是要在报纸上刊登的

1232
01:45:03,514 --> 01:45:06,711
我看见那些照片  我就登出来了
I saw the photos, I published them.

1233
01:45:06,950 --> 01:45:07,541
你偷了照片
You stole them.

1234
01:45:07,818 --> 01:45:09,649
我没有  就在这儿呢
I did not. Here they are.

1235
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:11,114
-那把照片给我  -等等
- Give them to me. - Just a second.

1236
01:45:11,355 --> 01:45:14,950
这是你的照片
Here are your photos.

1237
01:45:15,225 --> 01:45:18,717

1238
01:45:18,962 --> 01:45:21,624
冷静  你叫什么名字

1239
01:45:21,865 --> 01:45:24,766
-芝麻菜  -芝麻菜?

1240
01:45:25,736 --> 01:45:27,966
幸会  我是玛丽娜
Nice to meet you. I'm Marina.

1241
01:45:28,339 --> 01:45:31,831
别激动  我给你钱
Now, relax. I have money for you.

1242
01:45:32,142 --> 01:45:34,235
作为照片的报酬
For your pictures.

1243
01:45:34,578 --> 01:45:36,978
当报社选登了某张照片
Here, when we use a picture

1244
01:45:37,247 --> 01:45:39,181
我们会付给摄影师报酬
We pay the photographer.

1245
01:45:39,450 --> 01:45:40,940
你想当摄影师吗

1246
01:45:41,185 --> 01:45:42,447
是的
Yes.

1247
01:45:42,653 --> 01:45:44,484
开端不错  头版头条
Great start! On the front page.

1248
01:45:44,788 --> 01:45:46,483
你是怎么拍到这些片子的
How'd you get these photos?

1249
01:45:46,690 --> 01:45:48,590
我住在那里
I live there.

1250
01:45:48,826 --> 01:45:52,922
芝麻菜  从来没有摄影师住在那里面
Rocket, no photographer has ever been able to go in there.

1251
01:45:54,098 --> 01:45:56,293
如果你能拍到更多里尔泽的片子
If you could bring us more pictures of Li'lz',

1252
01:45:56,500 --> 01:46:00,937
报社就全部买下
The paper would buy them.

1253
01:46:01,205 --> 01:46:03,696
我们付给你报酬
We'd pay you.

1254
01:46:03,941 --> 01:46:06,307
愿意吗
Could you?

1255
01:46:06,510 --> 01:46:08,410
我不知道
I don't know.

1256
01:46:08,645 --> 01:46:10,112
有什么问题吗
What's the problem?

1257
01:46:10,347 --> 01:46:13,111
问题  问题就是我晚上再也不能出门了
The problem? I can't go there anymore at night.

1258
01:46:13,317 --> 01:46:15,512
那白天呢
And during the day?

1259
01:46:15,719 --> 01:46:17,346
太危险了
It's too risky.

1260
01:46:19,656 --> 01:46:23,956
瞧瞧  他们终于知道谁是这里的老大了
Look, man! They've finally understood that I'm the boss.

1261
01:46:26,330 --> 01:46:28,764
你那个摄影的朋友叫啥来着
What's your photographer-friend's name?

1262
01:46:29,066 --> 01:46:29,760
芝麻菜
Rocket.

1263
01:46:30,033 --> 01:46:32,763
这家伙不错  我还要拍更多的片
He's good. I'll take more to show the others.

1264
01:46:35,839 --> 01:46:39,741
芝麻菜  愿意还是不愿意
So, Rocket, is it yes or no?

1265
01:46:40,944 --> 01:46:42,844
这机会可是千载难逢啊
It's a great opportunity.

1266
01:46:46,517 --> 01:46:47,779
好吧
Okay.

1267
01:46:49,219 --> 01:46:50,618
你的决定是对的
You made the right choice.

1268
01:46:50,888 --> 01:46:52,082
非常好
Very good!

1269
01:46:52,489 --> 01:46:55,083
我会给你一些胶卷  镜头
I'll give you some film, lenses,

1270
01:46:55,325 --> 01:46:58,783
甚至另一部相机  我带你看下设备间
And even another camera. I'll show you the equipment room.

1271
01:46:59,897 --> 01:47:03,025
还有个问题
There's another problem.

1272
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:06,292
-什么  -今晚上我睡哪儿啊
- What is it? - Where can I sleep tonight?

1273
01:47:07,037 --> 01:47:09,938
现在我回不去了
I can't go back now.

1274
01:47:12,509 --> 01:47:15,239
这是135mm的
This is a 135mm.

1275
01:47:15,512 --> 01:47:17,139
想拍近景还是远景
Will you be close up or far away?

1276
01:47:17,414 --> 01:47:18,142
远的
Far away.

1277
01:47:18,415 --> 01:47:20,508
-会控光吗  -恩
- Can you measure the light? - Yes.

1278
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:27,115
你是不是太近了
Aren't you too close?

1279
01:47:28,525 --> 01:47:31,517
我不知道哪来的勇气跟他们那么说话
I don't know what spurred me to go talk to them like that.

1280
01:47:32,529 --> 01:47:34,656
也许我就要死了
Maybe I was going to die,

1281
01:47:34,932 --> 01:47:38,265
不过现在我得到了一个相机
But now I had a camera

1282
01:47:38,535 --> 01:47:41,663
还有成为摄影师的机会
And a chance to become a photographer.

1283
01:47:41,939 --> 01:47:44,464
注意脚下的狗屎
Watch out for the dog shit.

1284
01:47:44,775 --> 01:47:48,074
而且夜色尚早
Not to mention that the night was still young.

1285
01:47:48,479 --> 01:47:50,276
想吃点什么吗
Want something to eat?

1286
01:47:50,514 --> 01:47:51,708
不谢谢  女士
No, thank you, ma'am.

1287
01:47:51,982 --> 01:47:55,213
什么也不吃  什么也不喝
Nothing to eat? Nothing to drink?

1288
01:47:55,486 --> 01:47:56,578
吸大麻吗
A joint?

1289
01:47:56,820 --> 01:47:58,811
试试这个
Try this.

1290
01:48:19,243 --> 01:48:21,302
该睡觉了
It's time to go to sleep.

1291
01:48:23,514 --> 01:48:26,915
我带你看下床
I'll show you your bed.

1292
01:48:27,150 --> 01:48:28,708
你有热水吧 
You have hot water, don't you?

1293
01:48:28,952 --> 01:48:32,513
恩  你从没洗过热水淋浴吗
Yes. You've never taken a hot shower?

1294
01:48:32,723 --> 01:48:34,918
-没  -那你们怎么洗的
- No. - What do you do?

1295
01:48:35,125 --> 01:48:38,356
我们烧热水
We heat up the kettle.

1296
01:48:38,662 --> 01:48:40,152
你为什么还站在那儿
Why are you standing there?

1297
01:48:40,430 --> 01:48:42,330
我睡哪个房间
What room do I sleep in?

1298
01:48:42,566 --> 01:48:47,060
真遗憾  只有一个房间
Unfortunately, there's only one room.

1299
01:48:47,471 --> 01:48:48,768
你得跟我睡在一起
You have to sleep with me.

1300
01:48:49,072 --> 01:48:52,473
我不想详细介绍我的第一次性经验
I won't go into the details of my first sexual experience.

1301
01:48:52,776 --> 01:48:54,471
只是放松一下
Just relax.

1302
01:48:56,580 --> 01:48:58,605
因为  另一个地方
Because, elsewhere

1303
01:48:58,882 --> 01:49:01,476
一场关乎贫民窟的重要的性事
Another more important sex scene for the slum

1304
01:49:01,785 --> 01:49:04,618
正在上演
Was taking place.

1305
01:49:04,888 --> 01:49:07,686
就在看守帅内德警察
Carrot was helping Knockout Ned escape

1306
01:49:07,925 --> 01:49:10,291
和护士干得大汗淋漓的时候
Without firing a shot.

1307
01:49:11,495 --> 01:49:12,826
萝卜不声不响的
The policeman guarding him

1308
01:49:13,096 --> 01:49:15,826
把他救了出来
Was in the willing hands of the nurse.

1309
01:49:16,099 --> 01:49:18,090
与此同时
And in the meantime

1310
01:49:20,203 --> 01:49:22,603
为了铲除萝卜  里尔泽正在买进军火
To eliminate Carrot,  Li'lz'was investing in munitions.

1311
01:49:22,839 --> 01:49:26,036
他买进了一大笔  即使没钱付
He invested heavily, even if he couldn't pay.

1312
01:49:27,110 --> 01:49:28,304
双管枪记得不
Remember the double-barrel?

1313
01:49:28,612 --> 01:49:30,307
已经搞到手了
I already have it.

1314
01:49:30,547 --> 01:49:32,208
这是来福枪
This is a repeater rifle.

1315
01:49:32,549 --> 01:49:35,541
你们没有这个  伯朗宁自动手枪
You don't have this one, the browning.

1316
01:49:35,752 --> 01:49:36,548
用它都能打下一架飞机
It'll shoot down a plane.

1317
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:38,950
我打飞机干屁  我要的那种呢
I'm not shooting down planes. And the one I asked for?

1318
01:49:39,222 --> 01:49:42,749
Ar-15  美国佬
The Ar-15, uncle sam.

1319
01:49:43,026 --> 01:49:46,223
巴西搞不到那个
You can't get them in brazil.

1320
01:49:46,563 --> 01:49:48,030
操  美国佬
My ass, uncle sam.

1321
01:49:50,934 --> 01:49:53,027
我想到办法了
I have a solution.

1322
01:49:53,337 --> 01:49:55,134
罗格  见过没
The rugger. Ever seen one?

1323
01:49:55,372 --> 01:49:59,832
很像Ar-15  口径相同  重量轻一些
It's like the ar-15. Same caliber, but lighter.

1324
01:50:00,143 --> 01:50:03,237
带红外瞄准具吗  每分能连发400的吗
With an infrared sight? 400 shots a minute?

1325
01:50:03,647 --> 01:50:04,443
那要看情况
It depends.

1326
01:50:04,748 --> 01:50:06,238
看鸡毛情况
It depends, my ass!

1327
01:50:06,483 --> 01:50:09,475
耍我吗
Trying to fuck me over?

1328
01:50:09,753 --> 01:50:11,654
我先操你大爷的
I'll fuck you over first.

1329
01:50:11,655 --> 01:50:14,404
赶紧滚蛋  钱和枪都不准拿
You leave now without the money or the guns.

1330
01:50:14,405 --> 01:50:17,388
那我怎么和老板交代
What do I tell the boss?

1331
01:50:17,461 --> 01:50:18,485
那是你的事
That's your problem.

1332
01:50:18,762 --> 01:50:20,457
你会想出办法的
You'll think of something.

1333
01:50:20,764 --> 01:50:23,062
听见没  滚蛋
You heard him, chubby? Get out.

1334
01:50:23,367 --> 01:50:26,393
逃吧  胖子
Beat it, fatso.

1335
01:50:26,670 --> 01:50:28,262
里尔泽犯了一个大错
Li'lz' had made a big mistake.

1336
01:50:28,672 --> 01:50:29,661
他应该知道
He should have known

1337
01:50:29,873 --> 01:50:32,899
每个推销员身后都有一个供应商
That behind every salesman lies a supplier.

1338
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:35,178
他们可从不开玩笑
And they don't joke around.

1339
01:50:36,813 --> 01:50:39,475
看见这个没有
Have you seen this?

1340
01:50:39,683 --> 01:50:41,913
他们要Ar-15干什么
What do they need an Ar-15 for?

1341
01:50:42,219 --> 01:50:43,948
这会牵扯警方进来调查
These stories will push the police to investigate.

1342
01:50:44,221 --> 01:50:48,021
他们会抓住你  还有我  和你一起
They'll nab you. And me, along with you.

1343
01:50:48,325 --> 01:50:51,624
你觉得我会把你供出来吗
Think I'm going to give you away?

1344
01:50:55,632 --> 01:50:58,430
别担心  这事我会处理好的
Don't worry, i'll take care of it.

1345
01:50:58,635 --> 01:51:00,569
但是别再瞎搞了
But don't fuck up again.

1346
01:51:07,377 --> 01:51:08,639
查理
Charlie!

1347
01:51:10,647 --> 01:51:12,581
过来
Come here!

1348
01:51:12,849 --> 01:51:14,339
听着
Listen,

1349
01:51:14,651 --> 01:51:16,243
你告诉他
You tell him.

1350
01:51:18,055 --> 01:51:21,149
就让这个推销员的贱命来抵账吧
Let's go make that sleaze little dealer pay up.

1351
01:51:34,271 --> 01:51:36,068
过来  小伙子们
Come here, kids!

1352
01:51:37,407 --> 01:51:39,705
喜欢吃鸡不
Do you like chicken?

1353
01:51:40,010 --> 01:51:40,999
那要看怎么做
It depends.

1354
01:51:41,278 --> 01:51:42,870
一会儿我们吃鸡
We'll eat some chicken

1355
01:51:43,213 --> 01:51:44,805
然后把萝卜做成点心
And have Carrot for dessert.

1356
01:51:45,115 --> 01:51:47,015
我有一个礼物给你们
I have a present for you.

1357
01:51:47,217 --> 01:51:48,115
这里
Here.

1358
01:51:53,557 --> 01:51:55,548
给你们的一份大礼
A big one for you.

1359
01:51:55,759 --> 01:51:57,818
你真的要把这些枪都给我们吗
Are you really giving us these guns?

1360
01:51:58,128 --> 01:52:02,724
对  但你们要站在我这边  对抗萝卜
Yes, but I want you on my side, against Carrot.

1361
01:52:02,933 --> 01:52:04,764
我们也可以抢劫任何人吗
Then can we hold up anyone we want?

1362
01:52:05,035 --> 01:52:07,833
不是这儿的就行
Not in the slum.

1363
01:52:08,138 --> 01:52:09,571
-会开枪吗  -马马虎虎吧
- Can you shoot? - More or less.

1364
01:52:09,773 --> 01:52:10,762
啥叫马马虎虎
More or less?

1365
01:52:11,041 --> 01:52:13,566
你们几个  来帮帮这几个小鬼
Hey, you guys, come help these kids.

1366
01:52:13,844 --> 01:52:16,438
我知道  你们是这么弄得
I know. You do it like this.

1367
01:52:28,844 --> 01:52:30,038
末日的先兆

1368
01:52:37,667 --> 01:52:38,861
抓住那只鸡
Get that chicken!

1369
01:52:40,670 --> 01:52:41,659
来啊  追啊  
C'mon, let's go.

1370
01:52:52,816 --> 01:52:54,807
如果被里尔泽抓住了  他会杀了你的
If Li'lz' catches you, he'll kill you.

1371
01:52:56,820 --> 01:52:59,618
那也得看看他能不能找到我
Yeah, well, he's gotta find me first.

1372
01:53:07,831 --> 01:53:10,823
小鬼  抓住那只鸡
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!

1373
01:53:13,570 --> 01:53:15,128
操  条子来了
Shit! The cops!

1374
01:53:15,338 --> 01:53:17,738
跑你妈个毛啊
Hell, don't fucking run off!

1375
01:53:18,041 --> 01:53:18,939
把枪给我
Give me that.

1376
01:53:30,654 --> 01:53:34,852
傻瓜  说你呢  跑腿的 
Hey, melonhead! You fucking fag!

1377
01:53:35,158 --> 01:53:36,250
赶快滚蛋
Get the hell out of here!

1378
01:53:36,493 --> 01:53:37,653
胆小鬼
Coward!

1379
01:53:37,961 --> 01:53:38,950
蠢货
Asshole!

1380
01:53:42,666 --> 01:53:44,531
走吧  让他们自相残杀
Come on, let them kill each other.

1381
01:53:44,801 --> 01:53:47,326
他们能自己了结的
They can fuck themselves.

1382
01:53:54,911 --> 01:53:57,505
芝麻菜  给哥几个拍张片
Rocket! Take a picture of us!

1383
01:53:58,915 --> 01:54:00,610
还磨蹭啥呢
What are you waiting for?

1384
01:54:21,438 --> 01:54:23,929
怎么了
What's happening?

1385
01:54:24,174 --> 01:54:25,368
操
Shit!

1386
01:54:27,644 --> 01:54:29,168
撤
Let's go!

1387
01:54:30,380 --> 01:54:32,644
快跑
Run! Run!

1388
01:54:35,785 --> 01:54:37,275
小心
Watch out!

1389
01:54:39,656 --> 01:54:42,056
杀了哪个都行啊  炸死他
Kill one of these faggots! Blast him!

1390
01:55:55,732 --> 01:55:56,699

帅内德
Knockout Ned!

1391
01:55:58,301 --> 01:56:00,735
放松  别动
Take it easy. Don't move.

1392
01:56:01,037 --> 01:56:02,834
哥们  我受伤了
It hurts, man.

1393
01:56:03,106 --> 01:56:06,303
放松一点就好了  小鬼
Easy does it, kid.

1394
01:56:06,609 --> 01:56:09,305
你为啥也进来火拼
Why did you join this fucking war?

1395
01:56:09,546 --> 01:56:10,410
帅内德
Knockout Ned!

1396
01:56:10,714 --> 01:56:13,615
里尔泽撞车了  来啊
Li'lz's been hit. Come on!

1397
01:56:13,917 --> 01:56:14,713
在这等着  我一会儿救你
Wait here, i'll help you.

1398
01:56:14,951 --> 01:56:15,918
坚持住
Just hold on.

1399
01:56:26,129 --> 01:56:30,623
-你叫什么  -奥托
- What's your name? - My name's Otto.

1400
01:56:37,474 --> 01:56:39,635
我要为父报仇
I want to get my father's murderer.

1401
01:57:04,801 --> 01:57:07,326
帅内德  里尔泽撞车了  来啊
Knockout Ned! Li'lz's been hit. Come on!

1402
01:57:08,805 --> 01:57:09,601
我会救你的
I'll help you.

1403
01:57:09,839 --> 01:57:11,101
在这坚持住
Just hold on there.

1404
01:57:53,883 --> 01:57:57,284
又是他妈的条子
The fucking cops!

1405
01:57:57,520 --> 01:57:59,920
趴在地上
On the ground!

1406
01:58:00,223 --> 01:58:03,920
-不准动  -双手举过头顶
- Don't move! - Hands over your head.

1407
01:58:07,730 --> 01:58:10,722
-我要找的就是你  -你完了  老兄
- You're the one I want. - You're finished, pal.

1408
01:58:11,034 --> 01:58:11,932
铐上他
Handcuff him.

1409
01:58:33,022 --> 01:58:34,614
芝麻菜  你要去哪儿
Rocket, where are you going?

1410
01:58:34,824 --> 01:58:36,621
我要查清楚一些事
I got something to clear up.

1411
01:59:08,791 --> 01:59:10,224
好了  冤家
Okay, lovebirds.

1412
01:59:10,493 --> 01:59:15,089
来吧  里尔泽  算算咱们的帐
Come on, Li'lz', let's go settle our scores.

1413
01:59:15,331 --> 01:59:17,993
没你的事  你是交给媒体的礼物
Not you. You're a present for the media.

1414
01:59:55,138 --> 01:59:56,435
这就够1万了吧
Does it come to 10,000?

1415
01:59:56,739 --> 01:59:57,728
差不多  我全身上下就这些
Almost. That's all I have.

1416
01:59:57,974 --> 01:59:59,771
都在这  警官
That's all there was, chief.

1417
02:00:00,043 --> 02:00:01,032
每个地方都搜查过了
We searched everywhere.

1418
02:00:01,344 --> 02:00:03,244
放了他
Let him go.

1419
02:00:03,446 --> 02:00:05,573
这戒指是金子的吗
What about this ring? Is it gold?

1420
02:00:17,460 --> 02:00:18,859
先把这些填上  剩下的算是你欠我们的
Fill it up. You'll owe us the rest.

1421
02:00:23,166 --> 02:00:24,656
拼你妈了个逼
Fucking war!

1422
02:00:27,670 --> 02:00:30,070
帅内德挂了  我也身无分文
Knockout Ned is dead and I'm dead broke!

1423
02:00:30,273 --> 02:00:32,673
玩完了吧
You're fucked, eh?

1424
02:00:32,909 --> 02:00:34,399
小鬼们
Kids,

1425
02:00:34,677 --> 02:00:38,272
我们要多抢几次  东山再起
We'll have to do a few hold-ups to get my business going again.

1426
02:00:38,681 --> 02:00:40,308
东山再起  里尔泽
Your business, Li'lz'?

1427
02:00:40,583 --> 02:00:42,881
咋回事  小鬼
What's your problem, kid?

1428
02:00:43,119 --> 02:00:44,552
这是为我们朋友的  混蛋 
This is for our friend, motherfucker!

1429
02:00:44,821 --> 02:00:46,118
苏维埃起义
A soviet attack!

1430
02:00:53,329 --> 02:00:55,422
天下是我们的啦
The business is ours!

1431
02:01:50,153 --> 02:01:54,556
这片子让我得到衣食无忧的工作
This picture of the hood will guarantee my salary.

1432
02:01:56,726 --> 02:01:58,626
会让我出名
This one will make me famous.

1433
02:01:58,828 --> 02:02:00,318
甚至可能登上杂志封面
It'll even make the cover of a magazine.

1434
02:02:03,966 --> 02:02:05,627
我再也不用担心里尔泽了
I won't have to worry about Li'lz' anymore.

1435
02:02:09,439 --> 02:02:11,168
可还有警察呢
But the cops?

1436
02:02:19,649 --> 02:02:23,244
匪首  自诩为上帝之城的主宰  中弹身亡
Gangster, self-styled ''boss'' of the city of god, shot dead

1437
02:02:28,291 --> 02:02:30,657
这片子也许会给我们带来杀身横祸
This photo could've gotten us killed?

1438
02:02:30,893 --> 02:02:32,451
我想是这样
I think so.

1439
02:02:32,662 --> 02:02:34,152
至少它给了你一份工作
A least it got you a job.

1440
02:02:35,665 --> 02:02:37,098
不是工作  只是实习
Not a job, an internship.

1441
02:02:37,367 --> 02:02:39,267
薪水多吗
It pays a little, doesn't it?

1442
02:02:39,902 --> 02:02:40,869
一点点
A little.

1443
02:02:42,505 --> 02:02:44,496
那个女记者呢  是个不错的女伴吗
What about that lady journalist? Was she a good lay?

1444
02:02:44,741 --> 02:02:46,504
凑合吧
More or less.

1445
02:02:46,709 --> 02:02:48,142
你不喜欢吗
You didn't like it?

1446
02:02:48,411 --> 02:02:50,538
我觉得做记者的床上功夫不咋地
I don't think journalists know how to screw.

1447
02:02:50,913 --> 02:02:51,709
我猜也是
Yeah, I Guess so.

1448
02:02:51,948 --> 02:02:53,813
可可在巴拉连抢了3家
Cocoa robbed 3 houses in barra.

1449
02:02:54,117 --> 02:02:56,108
最好灭了他
Better kill him.

1450
02:02:56,319 --> 02:02:58,014
罗格是谁干掉的
Who shot Roger?

1451
02:02:58,321 --> 02:03:03,315
-牛肉  -杀了那贱人
- It was beef. - Kill that fucker.

1452
02:03:03,559 --> 02:03:07,017
我们还要杀了警察和鬼佬
We should kill the chief and gringo as well.

1453
02:03:07,330 --> 02:03:09,560
雪莉怎么办
What about cherry?

1454
02:03:09,732 --> 02:03:13,930
走  咱俩  还有3个
