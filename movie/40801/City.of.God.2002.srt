1
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:49,630
CITY OF GOD

2
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:56,322
Fuck, the chicken's got away!
Go after that chicken, man!

3
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:00,427
Get that chicken!

4
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:23,952
If it's a good photo,
I'll get a job at the paper.

5
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:27,062
-You think so, Rocket?
-Gotta take the risk.

6
00:02:27,264 --> 00:02:31,598
You'd risk your life
for a picture? Forget it!

7
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:35,260
You think I want to meet up
with that motherfucking hood?

8
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,600
Get that chicken, bro!

9
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:44,907
Motherfucker!
I told you to grab that chicken!

10
00:02:45,515 --> 00:02:46,607
Outta my way!

11
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,718
Get that chicken!

12
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,373
If Li'l Ze catches you,
he'll kill you.

13
00:03:13,143 --> 00:03:15,236
Yeah, well,
he's gotta find me first.

14
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,786
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!

15
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:28,589
Get that chicken!

16
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:32,350
Shit! The cops!

17
00:03:32,596 --> 00:03:34,461
Don't fucking run off!

18
00:03:34,864 --> 00:03:36,161
Give me that.

19
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:41,967
Hey, Melonhead!
You fucking fag!

20
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:45,506
A picture
could change my life, but

21
00:03:45,842 --> 00:03:48,811
in the City of God,
if you run away, they get you

22
00:03:49,613 --> 00:03:51,046
and if you stay,
they get you too.

23
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,807
It's been that way ever
since I was a kid.

24
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:11,093
You're useless, man!

25
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,734
-Go get the ball!
-Fucking useless!

26
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,268
Hey, kid!

27
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:20,440
Give me the ball, I wanna play.

28
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:26,173
You wanna mess with me?

29
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:29,582
Fuck off.

30
00:04:29,753 --> 00:04:30,777
What's your name?

31
00:04:31,755 --> 00:04:33,655
Sorry,
I forgot to introduce myself.

32
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,154
My name's Rocket.

33
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,189
Some advice, Rocket.

34
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,793
Don't let Li'l Dice
touch that ball. He sucks.

35
00:04:40,997 --> 00:04:42,362
You lose, pal.

36
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:43,892
That's Shaggy.

37
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,591
To tell the story
of the City of God,

38
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:48,633
I have to start with him.

39
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:49,894
8...

40
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,301
9, 10, 11...

41
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,601
But in order to tell
Shaggy's story,

42
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,842
I must tell the story
of the Tender Trio.

43
00:04:57,247 --> 00:04:59,238
Well, Shaggy?
The gas truck's coming.

44
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:01,313
What are you
fucking around for?

45
00:05:01,518 --> 00:05:02,712
You're not gonna chicken out.

46
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:19,159
The notorious Tender Trio was
legendary in the City of God.

47
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:20,727
Shaggy,

48
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:23,428
Clipper,

49
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:25,865
and Goose.

50
00:05:27,644 --> 00:05:31,375
Tagging along were always
Li'l Dice and Benny,

51
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,572
Shaggy's brother.

52
00:05:34,984 --> 00:05:37,043
I never had the courage
to follow my brother, Goose.

53
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,526
Okay, let's go.

54
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:48,789
Come on, Goose.

55
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:50,523
Let's go!

56
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,194
Stop this fucker!

57
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,518
Stop or I'll shoot,
motherfucker!

58
00:06:13,022 --> 00:06:13,750
Get out!

59
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,920
Hurry up, asshole!
Gimme the money!

60
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:26,629
Who wants gas?

61
00:06:33,576 --> 00:06:36,943
More! You wanna die
for your boss' damn money?

62
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,240
Shitloads of money here!

63
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:42,748
You see, asshole?

64
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:46,778
Fuck! The cops!

65
00:06:47,223 --> 00:06:49,214
Clear out!
The place is crawling with cops!

66
00:06:57,534 --> 00:07:01,197
-Shaggy!
-The ball, Goose, it's yours!

67
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:32,834
Back then, I thought
the guys in the Tender Trio

68
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,527
were the most dangerous hoods
in Rio.

69
00:07:36,573 --> 00:07:38,541
Here! Buy some new balls.

70
00:07:40,443 --> 00:07:42,775
But they were just amateurs.

71
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:47,711
Even my brother, Goose.

72
00:07:48,318 --> 00:07:49,876
Rocket, give this money to dad.

73
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:54,579
But don't tell him
it's from me.

74
00:07:55,124 --> 00:07:56,113
Okay?

75
00:07:57,494 --> 00:07:59,485
-Hey, Stringy!
-Yeah?

76
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:00,891
Look how much I've got.

77
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:20,645
We came to the City of God

78
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,147
hoping to find paradise.

79
00:08:23,553 --> 00:08:26,647
Many families were homeless

80
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:28,255
due to flooding

81
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:30,720
and acts of arson
in the slums.

82
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:31,985
A street light!

83
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:34,059
We'll have electricity!

84
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,323
The bigwigs in government
didn't joke around.

85
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:39,366
Homeless?
Off to City of God!

86
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:43,662
There was no electricity, paved
streets or transportation.

87
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:47,274
But for the rich and powerful
our problems didn't matter.

88
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,570
We were too far removed

89
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,680
from the picture postcard image
of Rio de Janeiro.

90
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,226
Do you think I can become
a lifeguard one day?

91
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:13,794
I don't know.

92
00:09:14,737 --> 00:09:17,706
Being a lifeguard
is better than a fishmonger.

93
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:20,501
I don't want to sell fish.
It stinks.

94
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,105
-Are you insulting your father?
-No.

95
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:26,948
So what do you want to be?

96
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:28,941
I don't know.

97
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:31,614
Not a hood or a policeman.

98
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:32,817
Why not?

99
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:34,853
I'm scared of getting shot.

100
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:41,519
Put that thing away, kid.

101
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:44,923
Are you nuts?
Pointing that gun at me?

102
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,226
Take it easy with the kid,
Goose.

103
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:49,332
Li値 Dice is with me.

104
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:52,572
Right, I'm a gangster too.

105
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:54,266
That gas truck
didn't bring much.

106
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:57,068
So what?
We rob gas trucks every day.

107
00:09:57,447 --> 00:09:58,937
One today,
another tomorrow.

108
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:01,446
No, we need to rob
some rich guy's house.

109
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:03,983
That's the only way
to get outta here.

110
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,588
Hell, no. What you need
is to follow my plan.

111
00:10:07,657 --> 00:10:08,589
That's it.

112
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:13,361
The little fart's getting
too big for his britches!

113
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:22,761
He gets high
and starts talking bullshit.

114
00:10:24,474 --> 00:10:25,668
You two junkies

115
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:27,773
aren't worth
half as much as that kid.

116
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,173
What you got in mind,
Li値 Dice?

117
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,181
To be a real hood
you need more than just a gun.

118
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,876
You need ideas.

119
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,188
And Li値 Dice had them.

120
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,361
-Is that the motel?
-Yeah.

121
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:50,828
We go in, grab the money and get
out. No killing, got that?

122
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,262
I need this.

123
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,970
-Don't touch my gun, kid.
-Don't ever do that again.

124
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,137
-Don't point at me.
-Fuck you.

125
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:00,274
Don't point your finger at me!

126
00:11:00,943 --> 00:11:02,342
Stop acting like a baby!

127
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:04,438
Here's yours.

128
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,238
-Awesome!
-Let's go!

129
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,941
-Not so fast!
-What?

130
00:11:10,153 --> 00:11:11,450
You stay here and keep watch.

131
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:17,858
If the cops come,
shoot that window over there.

132
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:19,953
Why me?
Let that dork do that.

133
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:20,854
Look.

134
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,588
I gave you this great plan,
for free.

135
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,758
While that guy's
absolutely useless!

136
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:28,459
-You just had the idea.
-Exactly!

137
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:30,764
You're just a kid, remember?

138
00:11:31,374 --> 00:11:33,706
You cover us, okay?

139
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:39,979
You'll get your turn.
Stop trying to rush things.

140
00:11:40,683 --> 00:11:42,082
You stay there.

141
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:49,850
This is a hold-up, bitch.

142
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:56,523
You should be studying
or working.

143
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,726
You don't even look like
hoodlums.

144
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:03,633
Instead, you ought to be
working or studying, boy.

145
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,367
Shut up!
What a pain in the ass!

146
00:12:08,044 --> 00:12:09,375
Okay, Clipper?

147
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:13,344
Shall we go in?

148
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,580
I didn't order anything.

149
00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:23,953
It's on the house, sir.
Hand over the money!

150
00:12:25,762 --> 00:12:28,060
Keep calm,
all I want is your cash.

151
00:12:28,264 --> 00:12:30,061
-Don't point that...
-Your wallet...

152
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:42,369
Hey, man.

153
00:12:43,112 --> 00:12:46,206
What kind of whorehouse
is this?

154
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,342
-You from the church?
-Yes, brother.

155
00:12:54,157 --> 00:12:55,556
Give it to me!

156
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,756
Slut!

157
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,520
You're fat and flabby!

158
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,128
Wanna take her place?

159
00:13:08,938 --> 00:13:10,530
What's going on?

160
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,042
The cops! Let's beat it!

161
00:13:14,243 --> 00:13:15,141
Let's go!

162
00:13:19,849 --> 00:13:22,044
Take that car.
I'll go get Li値 Dice.

163
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:26,053
Jesus, what a car!

164
00:13:32,595 --> 00:13:34,392
Something fucked up.
Li値 Dice is gone.

165
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:36,962
The cops are shooting,
let's go!

166
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:07,425
Slow down! Hold on.

167
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,121
You said you knew how to drive.

168
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,925
I do, so cool it!

169
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:13,658
Turn! Watch out!

170
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,774
You fucking asshole!

171
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:31,647
Hey, I didn't do it on purpose.

172
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:34,251
No one saw anything.

173
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,581
So keep your mouths shut,
understand?

174
00:14:40,263 --> 00:14:41,958
Hold on, I twisted my ankle.

175
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:44,896
Goose fucked up his ankle.

176
00:14:45,902 --> 00:14:46,891
It fucking hurts.

177
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:50,095
Take him into the woods.
I'll shoot to distract the cops.

178
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,603
-In God we trust.
-In God we trust.

179
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,214
Pass me the telephone, Penguin.

180
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,713
Shorty is another notorious
guy in the City of God.

181
00:15:05,521 --> 00:15:07,113
But it's not yet time
to tell the story.

182
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:11,016
It fucking hurts, Goose.

183
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:13,260
Shut up.

184
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,429
You sound like a damn sissy,
man.

185
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:24,065
Climb up!

186
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,534
No one saw anything?

187
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:28,375
How odd!
A car crashes into a bar

188
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:29,544
and no one saw a thing.

189
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:32,038
I suppose
you didn't see anything either?

190
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:33,180
As usual,

191
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,242
no one saw, no one knows.

192
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:41,948
So what's up, Shorty?

193
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,893
They're hiding in the woods.

194
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:47,218
Hello, Melonhead.

195
00:15:47,496 --> 00:15:52,524
I have this feeling
that they're out in the woods.

196
00:15:52,802 --> 00:15:54,030
The motherfuckers.

197
00:15:54,236 --> 00:15:55,703
They're out in the woods.

198
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:59,406
Felipe, lock up the car.
Rangel, come with me.

199
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:07,914
I can't see a thing.
How the hell can they see?

200
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:10,113
Fucking jungle.

201
00:16:14,323 --> 00:16:15,722
They stole a fortune
at that motel.

202
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:17,324
I know.

203
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:22,255
What if we took the money?

204
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,166
Are you craz?

205
00:16:26,135 --> 00:16:27,659
I'm not getting mixed up
in that.

206
00:16:28,337 --> 00:16:30,328
I want to exterminate
these guys.

207
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:32,838
What? Since when is stealing

208
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:34,942
from niggers and thieves
a crime?

209
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:37,639
It won't be hard to nab them.

210
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:39,940
I have a stoolie in the City.

211
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:08,801
Did you hear those shots?

212
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:11,946
If I catch one of them,
I'll kill him.

213
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,219
Maracana!

214
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,225
Open the door.

215
00:17:32,068 --> 00:17:33,035
What's the matter?

216
00:17:33,235 --> 00:17:35,066
The cops are after me.

217
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,570
Shaggy!

218
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:49,510
The cops are on my ass!

219
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:51,116
Hide me!

220
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,787
Quick, come in.

221
00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:01,585
Shit.

222
00:18:02,198 --> 00:18:04,928
I thought the cops
would be down there all night.

223
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,493
I had a vision, Goose.

224
00:18:09,905 --> 00:18:11,930
You been smoking something?

225
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:15,733
-You've had a job, right?
-Yeah.

226
00:18:16,245 --> 00:18:18,236
What's it like?
What do people say?

227
00:18:19,215 --> 00:18:20,512
I worked with my father.

228
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:23,810
And fathers talk a lot of shit.

229
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:27,047
You know what, Goose?

230
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,219
I'm getting out,
I don't want to die.

231
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,221
This gangster's life
isn't for me.

232
00:18:32,728 --> 00:18:35,629
Wait!
The cops are still down there.

233
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,423
I don't give a shit.

234
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,730
I'm going back to the church.

235
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,805
I will say of the Lord,

236
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,472
He is my refuge and my fortress,
in Him will I trust.

237
00:18:49,979 --> 00:18:55,918
Fear not the terror by night,
nor the arrow that flies by day.

238
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,084
-Stop, motherfucker!
-Don't move!

239
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:06,818
Stop, or I'll shoot!

240
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,496
--shall abide under the shadow
of the Almighty.

241
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:18,302
The hold-up at the motel
went down

242
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,808
as the bloodiest in history.

243
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,144
The destinies of the outlaws
then took different paths.

244
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:26,906
I don't think this guy
was involved in the heist.

245
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:29,616
See here?

246
00:19:29,818 --> 00:19:32,150
He's a worker, not a hoodlum.

247
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,820
I'll make him one now.

248
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:41,854
Destiny put Clipper
back into the hands of God.

249
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:48,159
Shaggy was in Bernice's hands.

250
00:19:50,139 --> 00:19:53,438
And Goose
was in my father's hands.

251
00:19:53,742 --> 00:19:57,041
Why do you do these things?
You think I'm a fool?

252
00:19:57,246 --> 00:19:59,578
From now on,
you'll work with me.

253
00:20:00,249 --> 00:20:03,446
Your younger brother
will keep an eye on you.

254
00:20:04,587 --> 00:20:05,576
You listen to me.

255
00:20:05,754 --> 00:20:08,780
If I catch you with money
that isn't yours,

256
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:11,453
I'll kill you.

257
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:12,757
That goes for you too.

258
00:20:13,362 --> 00:20:15,353
Get changed!
You start work immediately.

259
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,867
Having a hood
as a brother sucks.

260
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,967
You always end up
footing the bill.

261
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:24,661
Don't worry.

262
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,272
Dad's mad at me,

263
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,477
but he'll get over it.

264
00:20:35,384 --> 00:20:38,410
Give me that, Rocket.
It's not for you.

265
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:39,676
You have to study.

266
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:41,278
Getting shot
doesn't scare you?

267
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,889
I'm a hood
because I got no brain.

268
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:46,721
But you're smart.
You should study.

269
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:50,521
I go to school because
I don't like physical work.

270
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:52,625
Promise me something.

271
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:55,962
That you'll never touch
this gun. Promise?

272
00:20:56,939 --> 00:20:57,837
Let's shake.

273
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:02,443
We'd better hurry.

274
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,247
I'm gonna sell a lot of fish.
And don't laugh.

275
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,850
You grinned when I got slapped.

276
00:21:10,152 --> 00:21:11,642
-Who, me?
-I saw you.

277
00:21:39,982 --> 00:21:43,213
What is it, Shaggy?
Cat got your tongue?

278
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:46,114
Your fidgeting behind me
makes me nervous.

279
00:21:46,322 --> 00:21:48,222
I'm thinking
of what to say to you.

280
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:50,253
You're thinking, as well?

281
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:52,821
Don't.
It'll be your downfall.

282
00:21:53,028 --> 00:21:56,930
My heart has chosen you.
And I follow my heart.

283
00:21:57,132 --> 00:21:59,032
Are you pulling my leg?

284
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:02,635
You never heard of
love at first sight?

285
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:07,031
Hoods don't love, they desire.

286
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,971
You cut down everything I say.

287
00:22:09,178 --> 00:22:12,045
Hoods don't talk,
they smooth-talk.

288
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:16,343
Well, I'll stop
wasting my breath on you.

289
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:19,447
Hoods don't stop,
they take a break.

290
00:22:21,357 --> 00:22:23,655
Talking to you about love
sure is complicated.

291
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:27,360
It's not love,
it's a con game.

292
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,203
It's just that I love you.

293
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,516
You just might end up
convincing me.

294
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:16,040
After the hold-up, there were
constant police raids

295
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,634
in the slum.

296
00:23:24,353 --> 00:23:27,447
Every day,
someone went to jail,

297
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:29,155
someone was nailed.

298
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,157
But no one had seen anything.

299
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:35,452
No one knew anything.

300
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,664
No one blabbed to the cops

301
00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:41,360
about where the thieves
were hiding out.

302
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:47,697
Shaggy.

303
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,410
Why don't you change your life?

304
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:55,214
Get a job instead of
lying around in bed all day.

305
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:58,151
-Good-for-nothing!
-What do you mean?

306
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:01,119
You think you can make money
working? Go ahead.

307
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:04,025
That's right, Shaggy.

308
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,224
What do you think I do all day?

309
00:24:09,765 --> 00:24:11,027
Take it easy, baby.

310
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:13,330
You know all I want

311
00:24:13,969 --> 00:24:18,030
is to be with you
have kids, and a farm,

312
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,638
raise chickens,
grow pot and get high.

313
00:24:20,843 --> 00:24:24,244
Sure! For me,
that's nothing but smooth-talk.

314
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,388
What? I almost got rich
with that motel job.

315
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:40,250
Are you kidding?

316
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:42,596
The cops
are still looking for you

317
00:24:42,764 --> 00:24:44,527
because of the deaths
in the motel.

318
00:24:46,502 --> 00:24:49,096
What deaths?
What are you talking about?

319
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:52,739
Did you see anything?
You don't know shit, so shut up.

320
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:56,206
You weren't there.
I didn't kill anyone.

321
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,641
I bet it's those fucking
policemen,

322
00:24:58,847 --> 00:24:59,905
and I'm the one taking the rap.

323
00:25:00,215 --> 00:25:02,149
They even nabbed Li値 Dice.

324
00:25:02,651 --> 00:25:04,016
So don't bring it up again!

325
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,218
-I don't care who did it.
-It wasn't me.

326
00:25:08,524 --> 00:25:09,513
Let me just say.

327
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,416
I don't want my kid's father
to be a hoodlum.

328
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,126
You're all alone, Shaggy.

329
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:15,660
-All alone?
-That's right!

330
00:25:16,532 --> 00:25:18,432
-Clipper's gone religious.
-Hallelujah!

331
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:20,033
-Goose is working.
-Ass-kisser!

332
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,328
-And you?
-I haven't changed.

333
00:25:22,738 --> 00:25:25,571
So what?
They've deserted me, that's all.

334
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:29,443
Then I'm deserting you too.

335
00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:33,237
I'm splitting, Shaggy.
Come with me, if you want.

336
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:35,341
Otherwise, I'll go alone.

337
00:25:50,198 --> 00:25:52,098
Fish for sale!

338
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:55,692
My brother had promised
to stop messing around.

339
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:59,001
But a hood doesn't stop,

340
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:01,740
a hood takes a break.

341
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:06,137
Goose began messing around
with Shorty's wife.

342
00:26:06,348 --> 00:26:09,112
I have trout. But for
special customers like you,

343
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:12,349
I also have a kisser fish.

344
00:26:14,723 --> 00:26:16,054
Hey, that's a mullet!

345
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:21,126
Doesn't your husband

346
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:22,919
go down on you?

347
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:26,125
No.

348
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:29,629
Mine, before entering me,
has to use his tongue.

349
00:26:30,238 --> 00:26:31,637
For about half an hour.

350
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,834
And from behind?
Do you let him?

351
00:26:35,243 --> 00:26:37,575
Good God, no.
Doesn't it hurt?

352
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,241
The first few times.

353
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:42,446
Then you'll see,
it's fantastic.

354
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:43,775
But you need a banana.

355
00:26:44,486 --> 00:26:45,919
What for?

356
00:26:46,288 --> 00:26:49,280
You're missing
the good things in life, girl!

357
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:52,685
You take a banana,
warm it up...

358
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:55,725
Put it up your thing,
while he takes you from behind.

359
00:26:56,498 --> 00:26:57,795
It's a real rush!

360
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,891
Ask your husband.

361
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:03,896
I couldn't. You don't know him.

362
00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:05,704
He's liable to beat me.

363
00:27:05,907 --> 00:27:09,536
Try him. Men go wild
for smut like that.

364
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,914
Motherfucking nigger!

365
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,547
Slut!

366
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:26,726
Whoring bitch!

367
00:27:30,132 --> 00:27:32,930
Rocket, give me your shorts.
Quick!

368
00:27:33,135 --> 00:27:34,659
Take them off, dammit!

369
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:39,239
I'm not going naked
in the street.

370
00:27:39,441 --> 00:27:41,033
You want your brother to die?

371
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,040
Give me your shorts. Now!

372
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:44,476
Give me your shirt.

373
00:27:48,283 --> 00:27:49,682
Your shorts! Hurry up!

374
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:56,790
I knew it. It's always me
who forks up for that bum.

375
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,491
The bastard ran off.
That's his brother.

376
00:28:08,036 --> 00:28:10,334
-That brat there?
-I'll castrate that fucker.

377
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:17,545
Fish! Fish for sale!

378
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:20,810
Hey, kid, come over here.

379
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:25,113
-Where's your brother?
-He's not working today.

380
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,145
-Oh yeah? Get in.
-I didn't do anything.

381
00:28:28,423 --> 00:28:29,822
-Get in!
-What about my fish?

382
00:28:30,926 --> 00:28:31,824
Hurry it up, kid!

383
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,822
I don't want to lose my fish!

384
00:28:34,062 --> 00:28:34,528
Forget your fish.

385
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,823
Give me that.

386
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,226
My father will kill me.

387
00:28:40,535 --> 00:28:41,763
That doesn't matter.

388
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,109
Let's go. There's nothing here.

389
00:28:55,684 --> 00:28:57,117
That day, my father swore

390
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,681
he never wanted to see
my brother again.

391
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,683
Let's go, Felipe.

392
00:29:04,793 --> 00:29:05,817
And he never did.

393
00:29:06,027 --> 00:29:08,086
No one ever
saw him in the slum again.

394
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:11,489
The story of the Tender Trio
was coming to an end.

395
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:14,793
Li値 Dice?

396
00:29:15,637 --> 00:29:18,504
Shit, man. I thought
you were a goner at the motel.

397
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:21,499
You're fucking loaded!

398
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,510
Don't, Benny.
That's our money.

399
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,714
Fuck you. Cut the crap
and give me the money.

400
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:31,310
Benny.

401
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,251
Tell your brother Shaggy
that Shorty is squealing.

402
00:29:35,624 --> 00:29:37,148
I'm leaving the slum.

403
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:40,025
But Shorty had his hands full.

404
00:29:53,842 --> 00:29:55,139
Let's go see, Stringy.

405
00:30:05,754 --> 00:30:08,154
A neighbor called the police
before sunrise.

406
00:30:09,591 --> 00:30:12,253
The tabloids went to town:

407
00:30:12,661 --> 00:30:15,755
''Man Buries Wife Alive
in the City of God''

408
00:30:15,964 --> 00:30:18,956
Along with reporters, the place
was swarming with cops.

409
00:30:19,367 --> 00:30:22,598
The hoodlums took off.

410
00:30:24,673 --> 00:30:26,607
-You wanna die?
-It's you who's gonna die

411
00:30:26,775 --> 00:30:28,072
if you don't do what I say.

412
00:30:28,476 --> 00:30:29,670
And show the lady more respect.

413
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:35,672
Let's go, dammit!

414
00:30:35,884 --> 00:30:38,079
-There are cops ahead.
-Fuck them, let's go.

415
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:41,778
-Where to?
-Anywhere, just go.

416
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,317
What's the matter?

417
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,527
Have mercy!
This car is a piece of junk.

418
00:30:48,663 --> 00:30:52,224
-My ass! Start the damn thing!
-It needs a push.

419
00:30:54,569 --> 00:30:55,627
Push, Shaggy!

420
00:30:56,571 --> 00:30:57,629
Push!

421
00:31:12,354 --> 00:31:13,844
You?

422
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,949
You want to arrest the thieves?
Over there.

423
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,656
Nab that guy over there!

424
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:48,313
Run, Shaggy!

425
00:31:49,024 --> 00:31:50,616
Stop the car!

426
00:32:33,802 --> 00:32:36,669
This way! He's over here.

427
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:43,239
We got that son of a bitch!

428
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,709
-The bastard!
-He's a murderer.

429
00:32:58,126 --> 00:33:01,926
On the day Shaggy died
I remember the crowds

430
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,121
and a camera.

431
00:33:05,934 --> 00:33:08,528
I'd always wanted to have one.

432
00:33:10,338 --> 00:33:12,829
Let's go to school.

433
00:33:23,151 --> 00:33:25,585
-Well?
-Let's go to the beach.

434
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:29,046
But we have an exam.

435
00:33:30,158 --> 00:33:32,752
So what?
Everyone else is at the beach.

436
00:33:35,163 --> 00:33:35,959
Come on, let's go!

437
00:33:36,164 --> 00:33:38,860
She's in a bikini,
but doesn't want to go.

438
00:33:40,168 --> 00:33:41,760
What's that saying you have?

439
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:47,501
The sun is for everyone. The
beach, for those who deserve it.

440
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:55,748
I bought my first camera
when I was 16.

441
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:59,511
Like all poor people,
I started at the bottom

442
00:33:59,854 --> 00:34:01,754
with the world's cheapest
model.

443
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,824
So, Rocket?
How are things going?

444
00:34:06,528 --> 00:34:07,859
Any luck getting laid yet?

445
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,724
Zilch.

446
00:34:12,233 --> 00:34:15,532
Angelica.
I was craz about her.

447
00:34:15,737 --> 00:34:17,637
So, Rocket,
still clicking away?

448
00:34:17,906 --> 00:34:21,171
She was gorgeous and the only
girl in our gang who screwed.

449
00:34:21,743 --> 00:34:24,177
I wanted to lose
my virginity with her.

450
00:34:24,412 --> 00:34:25,379
With her, buddy?

451
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:27,637
She's got a guy.

452
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:29,348
So? I'm not jealous.

453
00:34:29,584 --> 00:34:30,778
Her father's a sergeant.

454
00:34:31,352 --> 00:34:32,751
No one's perfect.

455
00:34:33,054 --> 00:34:34,453
Closer together!

456
00:34:35,356 --> 00:34:37,654
I was the official
photographer of our gang.

457
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,150
The gang of groovies.

458
00:34:40,462 --> 00:34:41,588
Everyone paid

459
00:34:42,363 --> 00:34:44,490
to have copies of the pictures.

460
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:51,994
Tiago,

461
00:34:52,607 --> 00:34:54,097
move back a little.

462
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,305
Is this okay?

463
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,542
Perfect.

464
00:35:04,919 --> 00:35:06,386
I need a joint.

465
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:09,017
Instead of smoking, man,

466
00:35:09,824 --> 00:35:12,054
you should snort coke.
It's far out.

467
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:16,720
You snort, Tiago?
I prefer a good toke.

468
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,525
If you like,
I can get it for you.

469
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:23,361
You can?
Then go on, move your ass!

470
00:35:23,938 --> 00:35:26,236
But the choice stuff is coke.

471
00:35:26,774 --> 00:35:30,437
That's a real nercotic.

472
00:35:30,645 --> 00:35:32,442
Narcotic!

473
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,443
Your mouth is all salty, Tiago.

474
00:35:37,652 --> 00:35:39,347
Screw you.

475
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,352
You want to be
a lifeguard, Stringy?

476
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,717
-You're never in the water.
-My dad's a lifeguard.

477
00:35:44,993 --> 00:35:46,824
I'll bet you a beer
I swim better.

478
00:35:47,295 --> 00:35:48,523
You're on.

479
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,092
If you like,

480
00:35:53,301 --> 00:35:55,326
I can go get you a joint
at Blacky's.

481
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:12,047
I'd have done anything
to please her.

482
00:36:13,054 --> 00:36:14,715
Buy her pot, coke.

483
00:36:19,827 --> 00:36:22,022
I could go to the top dogs

484
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,621
to buy quality stuff
at a good price

485
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:28,426
because the local boss

486
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:33,236
was a former classmate: Blacky.

487
00:36:34,142 --> 00:36:35,439
Who is it?

488
00:36:35,643 --> 00:36:36,940
Rocket.

489
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:43,174
-How are things down there?
-Fine.

490
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:45,718
-And the kids?
-Fine too.

491
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,217
You want to buy
or smoke a joint?

492
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,887
-Buy.
-Come in, buddy.

493
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,117
Who is it?

494
00:37:03,504 --> 00:37:04,801
This was Blacky's turf.

495
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,900
But it hadn't always been his.

496
00:37:12,213 --> 00:37:14,010
-Hey, Blacky.
-Fuck, Li値 Dice.

497
00:37:14,549 --> 00:37:16,141
You show up like this
at my place?

498
00:37:16,517 --> 00:37:18,212
Who said it was your place?

499
00:37:21,256 --> 00:37:24,316
Dona Zelia began
selling drugs here

500
00:37:24,926 --> 00:37:25,950
in order to raise
her daughters.

501
00:37:26,227 --> 00:37:29,628
She also gave away drugs
to boys at times

502
00:37:30,265 --> 00:37:32,426
in return for special favors.

503
00:37:33,067 --> 00:37:34,932
Her favorite was ''Big Boy''.

504
00:37:36,237 --> 00:37:38,569
One day, he grew very big!

505
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:43,206
Zelia's operation
was so amateur

506
00:37:43,378 --> 00:37:46,711
that he had no trouble
seizing it from her.

507
00:37:47,882 --> 00:37:52,182
Big Boy used the neighborhood
kids as dealers.

508
00:37:52,987 --> 00:37:54,215
What about my pot?

509
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:57,083
Stick it up your ass.

510
00:37:57,292 --> 00:37:58,691
The best dealer

511
00:37:58,893 --> 00:38:00,485
was Carrot.

512
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:03,930
He earned Big Boy's trust,

513
00:38:07,635 --> 00:38:13,005
and moved up
to become a manager.

514
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:18,405
Blacky, 20 for us
and 5 for you, okay?

515
00:38:19,013 --> 00:38:21,140
One day a buddy of Carrot's
showed up.

516
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,416
His name was Aristotle.

517
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:27,818
My wife needs
an operation.

518
00:38:28,022 --> 00:38:29,956
His family had taken Carrot in

519
00:38:30,158 --> 00:38:32,524
when he was down and out.

520
00:38:32,927 --> 00:38:37,557
He couldn't refuse
to help a brother in need.

521
00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:42,030
Here's the dope. I want
the dough no later than Friday.

522
00:38:42,837 --> 00:38:44,862
-You've bailed me out, brother.
-Friday.

523
00:38:45,673 --> 00:38:51,305
He's my buddy,
practically my brother, Big Boy.

524
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:55,811
Give him another week.

525
00:38:56,484 --> 00:38:58,679
Either you kill him,
or I'll kill you.

526
00:38:58,886 --> 00:38:59,978
Carrot had no choice.

527
00:39:00,188 --> 00:39:01,712
I said Friday.

528
00:39:03,224 --> 00:39:05,522
Don't do it, man.

529
00:39:06,894 --> 00:39:09,488
Carrot wanted to kill Big Boy,

530
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:10,823
but it wasn't necessary.

531
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:14,896
Big Boy hadn't paid off
the cops. He died in jail.

532
00:39:18,306 --> 00:39:21,833
Carrot took everything
that belonged to Big Boy,

533
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,101
but didn't want the apartment.

534
00:39:25,413 --> 00:39:27,040
The place was ill-fated.

535
00:39:27,248 --> 00:39:29,307
Carrot gave it to his most
trusted dealer, Blacky.

536
00:39:29,517 --> 00:39:30,506
Here. 150 bags.

537
00:39:30,718 --> 00:39:32,413
Give me more.

538
00:39:35,056 --> 00:39:38,116
That's how he took over
the local trade.

539
00:39:39,026 --> 00:39:40,653
But not for long.

540
00:39:41,262 --> 00:39:42,729
Who is it?

541
00:39:44,532 --> 00:39:45,726
Go see.

542
00:39:57,578 --> 00:39:59,239
-Hey, Blacky.
-Fuck, Li値 Dice.

543
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,343
You show up like this
at my place?

544
00:40:01,582 --> 00:40:03,447
Who said it was your place?

545
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,447
Yeah, who?

546
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,586
Something wrong, Li値 Dice?

547
00:40:11,759 --> 00:40:15,957
Li値 Dice, my ass.
My name is Li値 Ze now.

548
00:40:18,766 --> 00:40:22,065
Li値 Ze had always wanted
to be boss of the City of God,

549
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:25,000
ever since he was called
''Li値 Dice''.

550
00:40:31,112 --> 00:40:33,307
They're having fun, and not me?

551
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,707
I want to get out of here.

552
00:40:46,127 --> 00:40:48,527
What, kid?
Your friend took everything.

553
00:40:48,729 --> 00:40:49,855
What do you want?

554
00:40:56,838 --> 00:40:59,864
That night, Li値 Dice
satisfied his thirst to kill,

555
00:41:00,141 --> 00:41:02,575
though he knew
Shaggy would never forgive him.

556
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:14,647
To avoid being punished
he left the City of God.

557
00:41:15,756 --> 00:41:17,747
He had to work hard
for peanuts.

558
00:41:23,164 --> 00:41:24,062
Yeah, Benny!

559
00:41:24,365 --> 00:41:26,458
Li値 Dice and Benny
managed well.

560
00:41:28,803 --> 00:41:30,464
They had the gift of crime.

561
00:41:30,671 --> 00:41:32,662
-You have more money than me.
-It was my idea.

562
00:41:33,674 --> 00:41:36,666
The only problem was running
into an older hoodlum

563
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:38,376
like my brother, Goose.

564
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:39,805
Li値 Dice?

565
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:43,348
Shit, man. I thought
you were a goner at the motel.

566
00:41:44,018 --> 00:41:45,349
You're fucking loaded!

567
00:41:46,854 --> 00:41:49,220
Don't, Benny.
That's our money.

568
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:53,658
Benny, tell your brother Shaggy

569
00:41:54,662 --> 00:41:56,857
that Shorty is squealing.

570
00:41:57,064 --> 00:41:59,862
I'm leaving the slum.

571
00:42:02,837 --> 00:42:03,929
Goose!

572
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:10,240
From Shaggy. You'll need it.

573
00:42:30,164 --> 00:42:32,758
From one hit to the next,
Li値 Dice grew up.

574
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,162
At 18, he was the most
respected hood

575
00:42:35,603 --> 00:42:37,400
in the City of God.

576
00:42:37,672 --> 00:42:39,663
You're of age now, watch out!

577
00:42:39,874 --> 00:42:42,672
He was one of the most
wanted robbers in Rio.

578
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,057
Li値 Dice, how's it going?

579
00:42:58,259 --> 00:43:01,854
Happy birthday.
I'm so glad you've turned 18.

580
00:43:02,063 --> 00:43:03,155
Get lost, Tuba!

581
00:43:03,364 --> 00:43:04,558
Excuse me, amigo.

582
00:43:05,866 --> 00:43:07,857
Give me a beer!

583
00:43:08,069 --> 00:43:10,560
Didn't you see me, prick?

584
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:11,770
-Sorry, man.
-Up yours!

585
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:13,838
The next time,
I'll waste you, asshole!

586
00:43:14,442 --> 00:43:16,171
Fag!

587
00:43:21,148 --> 00:43:24,140
Li値 Dice was ready
for anything.

588
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:25,444
I wanna talk.

589
00:43:26,587 --> 00:43:28,145
And he was itching to start.

590
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:29,846
Who are
the fattest cats here?

591
00:43:30,057 --> 00:43:31,354
There are tons of them.

592
00:43:31,592 --> 00:43:33,253
Look at Jerry Adriani

593
00:43:33,995 --> 00:43:38,455
gold chain, snazz clothes.

594
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,661
Look at Pereira
and the chick he's with

595
00:43:40,968 --> 00:43:43,232
Bernice.
She was my brother's girl.

596
00:43:43,604 --> 00:43:45,094
Check out his car.

597
00:43:45,806 --> 00:43:48,502
Then there's Blacky.
Covered in gold.

598
00:43:48,643 --> 00:43:50,736
Gold chain, gold watch.

599
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:55,308
Look at Carrot, and his car.

600
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,813
They're all dealers.

601
00:43:58,019 --> 00:43:59,509
They're all fucking loaded.

602
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,318
Hold-ups bring in chickenshit.

603
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,748
-The big bucks are in drugs.
-I see.

604
00:44:04,959 --> 00:44:07,120
Especially in selling coke.

605
00:44:07,328 --> 00:44:09,819
-But you need money.
-Not really.

606
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,532
We'll kill these clowns
and take over their business.

607
00:44:13,134 --> 00:44:16,729
-When do we start?
-Now.

608
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:29,848
Exu-the-Devil
is the light that shines forth.

609
00:44:30,851 --> 00:44:32,785
He brought you here.

610
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:37,953
Why remain in the City of God
where God has forgotten you?

611
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,394
I know what you want.

612
00:44:41,962 --> 00:44:43,293
You want power.

613
00:44:43,698 --> 00:44:47,293
I have something
which will give it to you.

614
00:44:49,503 --> 00:44:53,496
To change your fate,
I give you my protector, boy.

615
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:57,407
But you mustn't fornicate
with the amulet

616
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,204
otherwise,

617
00:44:59,547 --> 00:45:00,707
you'll die.

618
00:45:01,515 --> 00:45:03,312
The boy is no longer called
Li値 Dice

619
00:45:04,552 --> 00:45:06,918
but Li値 Ze.

620
00:45:07,722 --> 00:45:11,419
Li値 Ze will grow up.

621
00:45:13,027 --> 00:45:17,521
You'll stick with me,
I'll stick with you.

622
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,632
Li値 Dice became Li値 Ze

623
00:45:29,844 --> 00:45:31,243
and he began to kill.

624
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,045
He started one morning,

625
00:45:34,348 --> 00:45:36,782
taking over Jerry Adriani's
racket.

626
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:37,951
By that night,

627
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:43,988
almost all of the rackets
in the slum were his.

628
00:45:45,126 --> 00:45:48,527
The only business he didn't
touch was Carrot's

629
00:45:48,796 --> 00:45:50,127
since he was a friend
of Benny's.

630
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:52,489
All that was left
was the apartment

631
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,828
But that would be easy.

632
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:00,834
Who is it?

633
00:46:08,749 --> 00:46:10,512
-Hey, Blacky.
-Fuck, Li値 Dice.

634
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,246
You show up like this
at my place?

635
00:46:12,653 --> 00:46:15,019
Who said it was your place?

636
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:17,517
Something wrong, Li値 Dice?

637
00:46:17,825 --> 00:46:20,225
Li値 Dice, my ass.
My name is Li値 Ze now.

638
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,158
Li値 Ze, see?

639
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:25,423
-You're a goner, bastard.
-Don't kill him. He understands.

640
00:46:25,633 --> 00:46:26,565
Right, Blacky?

641
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:30,333
It's all yours.

642
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:32,533
I don't want no trouble, okay?

643
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:36,435
I should have taken this chance
to avenge my brother's death.

644
00:46:37,945 --> 00:46:41,142
You'll live,
but you'll work for us.

645
00:46:41,348 --> 00:46:42,440
Understand?

646
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:43,976
That's easy to say.

647
00:46:44,685 --> 00:46:48,086
-Where are you going?
-He's clean, Li値 Ze.

648
00:46:48,289 --> 00:46:51,087
What's your name, kid?

649
00:46:51,492 --> 00:46:54,120
-Rocket.
-He's Goose's brother.

650
00:46:54,495 --> 00:46:57,487
-Goose?
-The late Goose.

651
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,491
Quick, kid. Run along.

652
00:47:01,702 --> 00:47:04,830
Tell everyone that this
business

653
00:47:05,105 --> 00:47:08,302
now belongs to Li値 Ze.
And that we'll be selling coke.

654
00:47:08,509 --> 00:47:09,498
Got that?

655
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:11,935
Cocaine.

656
00:47:15,549 --> 00:47:18,541
-Where's the turf?
-Over there, on the left.

657
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:21,619
Selling drugs is
like any other business.

658
00:47:22,156 --> 00:47:24,647
The supplier
delivers the merchandise

659
00:47:24,959 --> 00:47:28,861
which is then packaged
on the premises.

660
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,023
It's done in an assembly line.

661
00:47:32,233 --> 00:47:33,427
Boring as hell.

662
00:47:34,535 --> 00:47:37,527
Pot is wrapped up in ''lids''.

663
00:47:38,572 --> 00:47:41,439
Cocaine is put into packets,

664
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:45,173
and then into bundles
of 10 or 100.

665
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,605
You can even make a career
in dealing drugs.

666
00:47:49,483 --> 00:47:52,281
The kids start out
as delivery boys.

667
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,788
They're paid to run errands

668
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:57,787
and take messages.

669
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,683
Then they become lookouts.

670
00:47:59,927 --> 00:48:01,121
If the police arrive,

671
00:48:01,328 --> 00:48:03,922
the kites disappear
and everyone scrams.

672
00:48:05,499 --> 00:48:07,694
Later, you become a dealer

673
00:48:07,902 --> 00:48:08,994
or a ''vapor''.

674
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,497
When the heat's on,

675
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,503
the ''vapor''
quickly evaporates.

676
00:48:13,507 --> 00:48:16,305
Moving up the ladder,
you have the ''soldier''.

677
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,005
And if the guy is good at math,

678
00:48:19,246 --> 00:48:20,508
he can become a manager,

679
00:48:20,714 --> 00:48:23,308
the boss's right-hand man.

680
00:48:25,753 --> 00:48:28,745
The police receive their part
and don't make trouble.

681
00:48:31,725 --> 00:48:34,216
Since Li値 Ze killed off
all of his enemies,

682
00:48:34,528 --> 00:48:37,554
there were no shoot-outs
in the City of God.

683
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:39,321
You could drive there.

684
00:48:39,934 --> 00:48:42,732
The playboys felt safe
buying their drugs there.

685
00:48:45,072 --> 00:48:46,801
The City teemed with addicts

686
00:48:47,308 --> 00:48:49,105
and Li値 Ze grew rich.

687
00:48:56,116 --> 00:48:58,983
I can't decide which to wear.

688
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:00,516
This one's cool.

689
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,485
If dealing were legal,

690
00:49:02,623 --> 00:49:04,716
Li値 Ze would have been
man of the year.

691
00:49:08,796 --> 00:49:11,822
But things were risky for me.
I was afraid of him.

692
00:49:12,099 --> 00:49:14,090
And he was everywhere.

693
00:49:14,301 --> 00:49:16,030
What a drag this guy is.

694
00:49:16,337 --> 00:49:18,134
Whenever I wanted
to smoke a joint

695
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:21,140
I had to go see Carrot.

696
00:49:26,146 --> 00:49:27,113
Half a lid.

697
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,015
Thanks.

698
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:33,551
But it was worth it.
I only smoked with Angelica.

699
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,115
She and Tiago had split up,

700
00:49:38,325 --> 00:49:40,316
so I made my move.

701
00:49:40,527 --> 00:49:41,653
I was about to win her over.

702
00:49:41,862 --> 00:49:44,854
These pictures are really
great.

703
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,123
You think so?

704
00:49:46,633 --> 00:49:47,964
I look good here.

705
00:49:49,136 --> 00:49:51,366
-You look beautiful everywhere.
-I'm serious.

706
00:49:51,638 --> 00:49:52,730
Me too.

707
00:49:55,776 --> 00:49:58,438
A setting sun,
a deserted beach

708
00:49:58,846 --> 00:50:00,438
a long kiss.

709
00:50:01,348 --> 00:50:03,248
I was sure this was it.

710
00:50:04,852 --> 00:50:06,752
But the Runts arrived.

711
00:50:07,988 --> 00:50:10,752
Can I have a toke?

712
00:50:16,663 --> 00:50:17,459
Here.

713
00:50:17,664 --> 00:50:20,792
I'm going. See you later.

714
00:50:23,971 --> 00:50:25,905
Hold on, Angelica.

715
00:50:27,474 --> 00:50:29,704
-Your joint, man.
-Keep it.

716
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:31,775
What a cool guy.

717
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:39,916
That was my first run-in
with the Runts.

718
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,425
Steak and fries, Benny.

719
00:50:47,661 --> 00:50:49,424
Great!

720
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,058
Here.

721
00:50:54,935 --> 00:50:55,959
A tip for you.

722
00:50:56,937 --> 00:50:58,529
Really? Thanks.

723
00:50:58,839 --> 00:51:00,238
-Wanna eat something?
-No.

724
00:51:04,344 --> 00:51:05,777
Wanna trade this watch?

725
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,742
After Angelica left him,

726
00:51:08,582 --> 00:51:10,243
Tiago began snorting
more and more.

727
00:51:10,784 --> 00:51:11,842
Is it your grandfather's?

728
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,949
No, my dad's.

729
00:51:14,254 --> 00:51:15,846
When a guy is really hooked

730
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:18,181
he ends up in the hands
of the dealer.

731
00:51:18,759 --> 00:51:20,454
-Two bags of ten.
-One of ten.

732
00:51:20,794 --> 00:51:21,658
Okay, one bag.

733
00:51:21,862 --> 00:51:24,456
For Tiago, it was different.

734
00:51:25,065 --> 00:51:26,464
Watch out!

735
00:51:27,267 --> 00:51:28,461
Sorry, godfather.

736
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:31,467
Godfather, my ass.
Did I baptize your kids?

737
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:32,070
I'm sorry.

738
00:51:32,272 --> 00:51:33,967
Now beat it.

739
00:51:37,778 --> 00:51:39,905
Blacky, lend me your bike.

740
00:52:04,638 --> 00:52:06,367
Hey, wanna race?

741
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,437
Where to?

742
00:52:08,742 --> 00:52:10,642
Up to the highway.

743
00:52:11,345 --> 00:52:14,781
-Okay.
-Ready? Go!

744
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:38,160
Pretty tough, wasn't it?

745
00:52:38,672 --> 00:52:40,196
Yeah, you're good.

746
00:52:41,275 --> 00:52:43,300
Where'd you buy those sneakers?

747
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:46,101
-Not far from here.
-The shirt, as well?

748
00:52:46,313 --> 00:52:48,747
-No, uptown.
-Cool.

749
00:52:48,949 --> 00:52:50,143
It's a designer shirt.

750
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:53,318
If I give you money
can you buy me one?

751
00:52:53,654 --> 00:52:55,417
Shorts and a shirt?

752
00:52:58,725 --> 00:53:00,124
Buy whatever you can.

753
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:05,925
-What size are you?
-Measure me.

754
00:53:06,133 --> 00:53:09,068
-With what, man?
-Shit, with your hand.

755
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,362
Shoe size?

756
00:53:12,139 --> 00:53:13,333
Turn around.

757
00:53:22,049 --> 00:53:23,038
Hey, Benny!

758
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,043
You got the digs?

759
00:53:25,586 --> 00:53:32,754
-Just one pair of pants?
-No, there's more.

760
00:53:38,165 --> 00:53:40,395
-You like it?
-Yeah.

761
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:41,992
There's some change.

762
00:53:43,704 --> 00:53:45,137
Keep it.

763
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,500
Cool.

764
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,707
This is Benny.

765
00:53:58,752 --> 00:54:02,518
-This is Rocket.
-Hi. I know him.

766
00:54:26,947 --> 00:54:28,039
I've become a playboy.

767
00:54:31,752 --> 00:54:35,244
Hey, gangsters, listen to this.

768
00:54:35,989 --> 00:54:37,251
Watch out.

769
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:40,859
Groovies shake their asses
before laying a big one.

770
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:46,495
Oh yeah?

771
00:54:52,739 --> 00:54:54,229
Fuck off, you bastards!

772
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:56,202
Making fun of me?

773
00:54:58,245 --> 00:54:59,337
Asshole!

774
00:55:14,961 --> 00:55:17,225
Benny, didn't I tell you
to shoot Carrot?

775
00:55:17,431 --> 00:55:18,921
He's endangering the slum.

776
00:55:19,366 --> 00:55:22,529
-Cool it. Go talk to him.
-I'm gonna kill that fucker.

777
00:55:22,769 --> 00:55:24,669
Stop trying to wipe out
everyone.

778
00:55:24,938 --> 00:55:25,632
I'm gonna kill him.

779
00:55:28,342 --> 00:55:30,776
Don't worry, Angelica.
The guys in here are cool.

780
00:55:30,977 --> 00:55:33,639
Sure, I'm not worried.

781
00:55:34,648 --> 00:55:37,845
You gonna dance, Benny?
What about Carrot?

782
00:55:38,151 --> 00:55:41,643
Go talk to the guy.

783
00:55:42,989 --> 00:55:45,719
Benny was the coolest hood
in the City of God.

784
00:55:46,626 --> 00:55:49,094
He gave away pot,
paid for drinks.

785
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:53,322
Li値 Ze was the opposite.
He had one obsession:

786
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,295
to be the boss of the slum.

787
00:55:55,635 --> 00:55:58,934
He wanted an excuse
to take over Carrot's racket.

788
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:00,797
-Hey, Carrot.
-What's up?

789
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:04,533
You shouldn't let the Runts
do hold-ups in the slum.

790
00:56:04,845 --> 00:56:08,508
You look after your section,
I'll look after mine.

791
00:56:08,915 --> 00:56:12,817
Got that?
I'm gonna get a drink.

792
00:56:21,061 --> 00:56:23,825
-Hey, Rocket! How's it going?
-Great.

793
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:28,533
-Hey, Benny!
-How's it going?

794
00:56:29,669 --> 00:56:32,160
-Hey, Tiago. How are you?
-Good.

795
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,037
-May I?
-Sure.

796
00:56:35,342 --> 00:56:37,276
Wanna dance?

797
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:42,843
Is it okay at your place?

798
00:56:43,183 --> 00:56:44,115
No problem.

799
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,514
My parents are out.
You'll be all alone with her.

800
00:56:47,788 --> 00:56:50,689
You can lose
your virginity tonight.

801
00:56:50,891 --> 00:56:52,518
Not so loud, man!

802
00:56:52,726 --> 00:56:54,990
Everyone will hear.

803
00:56:56,229 --> 00:56:58,697
-You're beautiful.
-Thank you.

804
00:56:58,899 --> 00:56:59,991
Shit!

805
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,525
Nothing's happening.

806
00:57:10,243 --> 00:57:12,643
Look, man, I know the Runts
are associated with you.

807
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,814
Think I'm a sucker,
you little brat?

808
00:57:15,215 --> 00:57:18,412
-You want to take my racket?
-I want to talk to you

809
00:57:18,919 --> 00:57:20,853
because you're fucking useless.

810
00:57:21,755 --> 00:57:22,722
Get your hand away!

811
00:57:23,056 --> 00:57:24,717
The Runts are screwing up
our security, man.

812
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:27,525
Give the baby his bottle.

813
00:57:28,061 --> 00:57:31,360
Carrot, just ask the kids
to cool it, okay?

814
00:57:31,765 --> 00:57:32,732
Carrot's useless.

815
00:57:32,933 --> 00:57:34,924
He lets the Runts do hold-ups
in his section.

816
00:57:35,135 --> 00:57:36,762
The police come around

817
00:57:37,237 --> 00:57:38,727
and that's bad for business.

818
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,840
I'll do it
only because I like you.

819
00:57:42,943 --> 00:57:45,309
But you need to change
that baby's diapers.

820
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,312
I'll show you
who's the baby.

821
00:57:48,515 --> 00:57:53,475
Tell the kids that in my slum
no one robs or rapes!

822
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:55,588
No wonder you're ''Little'' Ze!

823
00:57:58,925 --> 00:58:02,691
The Runts were kids
who didn't respect the laws

824
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:03,885
of the slum.

825
00:58:04,097 --> 00:58:06,190
They would mug residents,
hold up bakeries,

826
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,494
especially in Carrot's section.

827
00:58:09,636 --> 00:58:10,728
What are you doing?

828
00:58:18,011 --> 00:58:19,706
You rob me all the time!

829
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,107
But they didn't know

830
00:58:21,515 --> 00:58:25,212
that the City had a boss now.

831
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,747
THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING US

832
00:58:29,155 --> 00:58:31,749
The City had became much safer

833
00:58:31,958 --> 00:58:33,255
for residents.

834
00:58:34,628 --> 00:58:36,653
There were hardly
any hold-ups now.

835
00:58:36,863 --> 00:58:38,922
You just had to go see Li値 Ze.

836
00:58:39,533 --> 00:58:41,831
-Let's go.
-Don't hurt the Runts.

837
00:58:43,203 --> 00:58:45,262
I won't touch them.

838
00:58:49,009 --> 00:58:51,477
-Hi, Steak.
-How's it going, Lil Ze?

839
00:58:51,678 --> 00:58:53,771
-Wanna take a walk, Steak?
-With you? Hold on.

840
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:58,080
Mom, I'm going out
with my friends.

841
00:59:11,698 --> 00:59:13,689
That's the best chicken
I ever ate.

842
00:59:15,001 --> 00:59:16,730
The old guy was scared
shitless.

843
00:59:17,037 --> 00:59:18,732
Feeling sorry for him?

844
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:20,731
You're craz, man!

845
00:59:21,007 --> 00:59:22,406
Why not stick up
a bank or a supermarket?

846
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,312
Peanuts.
Drugs are where it's at.

847
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,852
Yeah, selling drugs.

848
00:59:36,222 --> 00:59:38,156
But you have to start out
as a delivery boy.

849
00:59:38,358 --> 00:59:39,620
You wanna be a delivery boy?

850
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,123
It's a rip-off.
It takes a long time

851
00:59:41,528 --> 00:59:42,517
to move up.

852
00:59:42,729 --> 00:59:44,629
You have to wait till an older
guy gets killed to move up.

853
00:59:44,864 --> 00:59:47,059
I don't wanna wait till
some guy croaks.

854
00:59:51,037 --> 00:59:54,438
I'm gonna do what Li値 Ze did.

855
00:59:55,575 --> 00:59:59,238
I'm gonna wipe them all out.

856
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:03,941
Talking about me, kid?
The boss is here.

857
01:00:07,954 --> 01:00:10,855
Come back, you brat!

858
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:17,262
They're quick, those kids.

859
01:00:18,164 --> 01:00:19,597
They run fast.

860
01:00:19,799 --> 01:00:21,460
They're all gone except you.

861
01:00:23,803 --> 01:00:25,065
Any others?

862
01:00:32,679 --> 01:00:34,704
You're gonna pay
for the ones that escaped.

863
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:38,010
You choose. Shall I shoot you
in the hand or foot?

864
01:00:38,685 --> 01:00:40,016
Come on, choose!

865
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,017
Hand or foot?

866
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:43,120
Choose, for fuck's sake!

867
01:00:43,323 --> 01:00:45,655
-Hand.
-The little hand, eh?

868
01:00:45,859 --> 01:00:47,224
Cool.

869
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,358
Hey, Steak'n'fries,
let's see what you're made of.

870
01:00:54,934 --> 01:00:56,424
Choose and then kill
one of them.

871
01:00:58,838 --> 01:01:00,863
Leave it. I'll do it.

872
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:11,647
Butt out, Tuba.
This is for him.

873
01:01:13,653 --> 01:01:14,745
Go on, Steak.

874
01:01:15,455 --> 01:01:17,252
Go on, choose one and shoot.

875
01:01:18,058 --> 01:01:21,050
Come on, I haven't got all day.

876
01:01:28,168 --> 01:01:29,157
Kill one of them.

877
01:01:34,374 --> 01:01:36,968
I wanna see
what you're made of.

878
01:01:58,231 --> 01:01:59,528
Well done!

879
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,760
You did it.

880
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:04,034
You're one of us.

881
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:06,434
Very good, Steak.

882
01:02:10,844 --> 01:02:14,280
Get up, brat.
Go back to your rat hole.

883
01:02:14,581 --> 01:02:16,242
Without limping!

884
01:02:16,583 --> 01:02:20,849
Tell your buddies that no one
robs in Lil Ze's slum.

885
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,644
Go now. And no limping, okay?

886
01:02:23,256 --> 01:02:25,383
Cool, Lil Ze.

887
01:02:42,876 --> 01:02:45,811
While Li値 Ze was winning
the respect of the residents.

888
01:02:47,147 --> 01:02:49,741
Benny was winning
Angelica's heart.

889
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:54,916
As for me, I was still
a virgin, single and broke.

890
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:56,819
I had no choice.

891
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,556
I had to take a job

892
01:03:03,763 --> 01:03:05,731
in a supermarket.

893
01:03:05,965 --> 01:03:07,660
I worked long hours
for chickenfeed.

894
01:03:08,067 --> 01:03:09,762
I wanted to be laid off

895
01:03:09,969 --> 01:03:14,531
so I could buy a camera
with the severance pay.

896
01:03:15,975 --> 01:03:18,136
But things
didn't work out that way.

897
01:03:21,948 --> 01:03:24,644
-It's the guy on the beach.
-Hey, bro!

898
01:03:25,451 --> 01:03:27,248
-Still smoking good stuff?
-Yeah.

899
01:03:27,754 --> 01:03:29,949
That guy's too cool.

900
01:03:30,256 --> 01:03:32,451
Hey, kid. Come here.
Lift up your shirt.

901
01:03:37,197 --> 01:03:40,462
We give these slum kids a chance
and they don't appreciate it.

902
01:03:40,667 --> 01:03:43,795
-What about my severance pay?
-What severance pay?

903
01:03:44,137 --> 01:03:47,732
That fucking manager thought
I was part of the gang.

904
01:03:48,641 --> 01:03:50,700
You're fired for
serious misconduct.

905
01:03:50,944 --> 01:03:53,310
Get out. Immediately!

906
01:03:53,713 --> 01:03:56,011
I didn't get a single cent.

907
01:04:11,231 --> 01:04:13,529
It was like a message from God:

908
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:18,836
''Honesty doesn't pay, sucker. ''

909
01:04:32,352 --> 01:04:34,252
The bus sure took
a long time to come.

910
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:35,944
I should already be at work.

911
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:39,857
Shit, hide that gun.
Are you nuts?

912
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:42,592
It was Goose's.
It's broken anyway.

913
01:04:42,762 --> 01:04:45,287
The company
runs few buses on this line.

914
01:04:45,498 --> 01:04:46,897
It's never anyone's fault.

915
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:49,295
It's always someone else.

916
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:51,934
It's my grandfather's fault.

917
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,932
And then,
they make us squeeze!

918
01:04:54,207 --> 01:04:55,606
Have a nice evening, ma'am.

919
01:04:59,212 --> 01:05:00,110
I know that guy.

920
01:05:00,513 --> 01:05:03,914
He lives in the City.
He'll recognize us.

921
01:05:04,117 --> 01:05:06,347
So? He couldn't care less
if we take his boss' money.

922
01:05:06,853 --> 01:05:08,548
Okay. Let's go.

923
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:15,018
Well, boys?
Aren't you from the City of God?

924
01:05:16,029 --> 01:05:16,927
Yeah.

925
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:20,822
I'll let one of you through
without paying.

926
01:05:25,038 --> 01:05:26,232
You should study

927
01:05:26,572 --> 01:05:29,973
so you can get out of the slum.

928
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,939
It's too full
of cops and hoodlums.

929
01:05:32,145 --> 01:05:32,975
Did you study?

930
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:36,041
I was in school
and in the army.

931
01:05:36,249 --> 01:05:38,774
I was the best marksman
in my barracks.

932
01:05:39,786 --> 01:05:42,380
This job was all
I could find afterwards.

933
01:05:42,956 --> 01:05:46,483
But I do karate.
If I'm hired somewhere,

934
01:05:46,726 --> 01:05:48,887
I'll leave the slum.

935
01:05:49,095 --> 01:05:50,687
Do you fight, then?

936
01:05:50,997 --> 01:05:53,727
I'm for peace and love.

937
01:05:53,933 --> 01:05:55,298
But if I have to.

938
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:57,795
He didn't know
he would have to.

939
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:01,734
But not yet, it's not time
to tell Knockout Ned's story.

940
01:06:03,142 --> 01:06:05,133
-We should be going.
-Let's go.

941
01:06:05,511 --> 01:06:06,705
-Goodbye.
-Thanks.

942
01:06:06,913 --> 01:06:07,743
See you.

943
01:06:13,353 --> 01:06:16,117
I couldn't do it.
He was such a cool guy.

944
01:06:16,322 --> 01:06:18,813
Yeah, totally.
That's Gerson's brother.

945
01:06:20,526 --> 01:06:21,618
Let's go home.

946
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:28,932
There's nothing here
except that bakery over there.

947
01:06:29,135 --> 01:06:30,659
What will you say?

948
01:06:30,937 --> 01:06:33,531
I don't know.
''This is a hold-up''.

949
01:06:36,175 --> 01:06:37,574
Here's my number.

950
01:06:37,844 --> 01:06:40,176
-You like soul or groovy?
-Soul.

951
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,241
That one didn't work either.

952
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:44,277
The counter girl
was just too fo xy.

953
01:06:44,484 --> 01:06:45,610
And she flirted with me.

954
01:06:45,818 --> 01:06:47,183
Will you call me?

955
01:06:48,488 --> 01:06:51,924
I couldn't pull a gun on her,
she was such a cool girl.

956
01:06:52,125 --> 01:06:53,285
Yeah, I agree.

957
01:06:56,629 --> 01:06:57,527
Excuse me.

958
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:03,598
I'm lost.
How do I get to Barra?

959
01:07:03,836 --> 01:07:04,928
-To Barra?
-Yes.

960
01:07:05,505 --> 01:07:07,735
I thought: ''Tough luck
for this guy from Sao Paulo. ''

961
01:07:08,207 --> 01:07:09,299
In fact, we were going there.

962
01:07:09,509 --> 01:07:11,101
You're kidding.

963
01:07:12,011 --> 01:07:15,640
-You're a lifesaver.
-That's right.

964
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:19,509
Because no guy from Sao Paulo
could ever be cool.

965
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,425
The body's over here.

966
01:07:29,729 --> 01:07:31,560
We found it, Chief.

967
01:07:31,764 --> 01:07:34,426
The forensic expert!

968
01:07:49,015 --> 01:07:52,883
-Not a pretty sight, eh?
-You said it.

969
01:07:53,086 --> 01:07:55,077
-What a great singer.
-You like him?

970
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:56,819
I love music. What about you?

971
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:58,722
Tell me, do you also like pot?

972
01:08:00,893 --> 01:08:04,829
I can't say
I've never tried it.

973
01:08:05,031 --> 01:08:09,024
The devil recognizes his own.

974
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:12,737
Do you have papers?

975
01:08:12,939 --> 01:08:15,134
I think so.

976
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:17,305
I have some.

977
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:20,938
I'd always been an ace
at rolling a joint.

978
01:08:21,147 --> 01:08:23,308
If I'd had the same skill
with girls,

979
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:27,748
I'd never have lost so many
chances to lose my virginity.

980
01:08:30,723 --> 01:08:33,749
For a Sao Paulo guy
you're really cool.

981
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,655
Thanks, bro.

982
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:38,023
What did they use?

983
01:08:38,931 --> 01:08:40,831
A club or a rock.

984
01:08:41,334 --> 01:08:42,961
And the child?

985
01:08:43,169 --> 01:08:45,763
-Untouched.
-Thank goodness.

986
01:08:46,572 --> 01:08:47,903
How long ago?

987
01:08:48,474 --> 01:08:51,034
About four hours.

988
01:08:51,511 --> 01:08:53,706
-Can we take it away?
-Go ahead.

989
01:08:54,514 --> 01:08:56,277
The murderer

990
01:08:56,482 --> 01:08:59,679
has to be from the City of God.

991
01:09:18,504 --> 01:09:19,835
You bastard! You motherfucker!

992
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:25,601
Did you have to kill
your chick in the slum?

993
01:09:26,312 --> 01:09:28,746
The place is crawling
with cops now!

994
01:09:29,015 --> 01:09:30,004
Come on, Li値 Ze.

995
01:09:30,216 --> 01:09:31,706
Come on? Fuck you!

996
01:09:32,151 --> 01:09:34,016
I had to avenge my honor.

997
01:09:34,654 --> 01:09:37,714
Her family's turned me in.
You won't have any problems.

998
01:09:38,524 --> 01:09:41,015
The cops are everywhere
because of you.

999
01:09:41,227 --> 01:09:42,956
You're dead meat, asshole.

1000
01:09:43,162 --> 01:09:45,096
Let up, Li値 Ze.
You've punished him enough.

1001
01:09:45,331 --> 01:09:46,923
You know the law.

1002
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:50,099
Anyone who kills in my slum
has to die as an example.

1003
01:09:50,336 --> 01:09:52,827
That was his business, Li値 Ze.

1004
01:09:53,139 --> 01:09:55,607
Listen, you sonofabitch,
get outta the slum.

1005
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:57,967
You showed no respect,
understand?

1006
01:10:01,247 --> 01:10:02,578
You know what, Benny?

1007
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:06,749
You're too nice. If you raise
a snake, expect to get bitten.

1008
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,853
He wasn't worth shit.

1009
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:11,384
A dirty traitor.

1010
01:10:11,591 --> 01:10:12,751
Shut up, Tuba.

1011
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:15,059
I'm going for a walk
with my girl.

1012
01:10:15,595 --> 01:10:17,756
Okay, be careful.

1013
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:20,792
When things calm down

1014
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,594
we'll get back to our business
with Carrot, okay?

1015
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:30,666
You need a girlfriend, Li値 Ze.

1016
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:53,559
Know what I'm thinking, Benny?

1017
01:10:55,134 --> 01:10:56,567
That I'm so sexy?

1018
01:10:57,937 --> 01:11:01,168
That too. But I mean,
you know what we could do?

1019
01:11:01,741 --> 01:11:02,571
Make love again.

1020
01:11:02,742 --> 01:11:03,970
I'm serious.

1021
01:11:06,045 --> 01:11:10,345
We could go away from here.
This violence sucks.

1022
01:11:11,951 --> 01:11:12,849
Go where?

1023
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:15,849
To a farm.

1024
01:11:17,757 --> 01:11:19,657
We're really hippies at heart,
aren't we?

1025
01:11:22,962 --> 01:11:23,951
A farm?

1026
01:11:28,467 --> 01:11:29,456
Peace and love?

1027
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:07,533
Benny was just too cool
to go on being a hoodlum.

1028
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:10,174
He succeeded
in getting everybody together

1029
01:12:10,443 --> 01:12:11,432
for his goodbye party.

1030
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:12,736
The gangs.

1031
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:16,044
The soul crowd.

1032
01:12:20,953 --> 01:12:22,250
The religious crowd.

1033
01:12:22,455 --> 01:12:23,854
One day, I'll go to church.

1034
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:27,991
The samba crowd.

1035
01:12:32,398 --> 01:12:33,660
The groovy crowd.

1036
01:12:37,403 --> 01:12:40,600
And Li値 Ze, who had never
danced in his life.

1037
01:13:00,726 --> 01:13:02,819
Want to dance with me?

1038
01:13:03,429 --> 01:13:05,260
Want to dance with me?

1039
01:13:05,531 --> 01:13:07,726
-I didn't hear.
-Want to dance?

1040
01:13:07,933 --> 01:13:10,333
No, thank you,
I'm with someone.

1041
01:13:25,584 --> 01:13:26,642
Hey, Rocket!

1042
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:43,601
Come, I want to talk
to you, buddy.

1043
01:13:45,704 --> 01:13:47,695
You can't just split
with that chick.

1044
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:49,107
Why not?

1045
01:13:49,308 --> 01:13:53,210
I'm gonna go live on a farm,
smoke pot, listen to rock.

1046
01:13:53,412 --> 01:13:55,642
You wanna throw away
everything we've accomplished

1047
01:13:55,915 --> 01:13:56,813
for that bitch?

1048
01:13:57,216 --> 01:14:00,117
She's not a bitch,
she's my girl.

1049
01:14:01,253 --> 01:14:03,653
We'll take over Carrot's
business, it'll be yours.

1050
01:14:04,123 --> 01:14:05,818
Leave Carrot alone,
he's a good guy.

1051
01:14:06,058 --> 01:14:07,218
He's a motherfucker!

1052
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:10,017
See? Everyone's a motherfucker
to you.

1053
01:14:10,663 --> 01:14:12,221
That's why I'm leaving.

1054
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:14,658
I'm your friend,
but I'm getting out.

1055
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:16,232
You got to understand,
I have to go.

1056
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:21,929
I love you, man,
but I've had enough.

1057
01:15:21,667 --> 01:15:24,329
Motherfucker, let's see
if you have any balls.

1058
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:25,762
What is this?

1059
01:15:26,038 --> 01:15:27,562
You wanna die?
Fuck off, bitch!

1060
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:31,767
Strip, nigger.
I wanna see your ass.

1061
01:15:32,177 --> 01:15:33,576
Hurry up!

1062
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:36,143
Take it all off! Now!

1063
01:15:37,349 --> 01:15:38,748
I wanna see your ass.

1064
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:41,844
Come on, faggot!

1065
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:45,321
Let's go, nigger!

1066
01:15:53,098 --> 01:15:55,225
Show your ass to everyone!

1067
01:15:56,502 --> 01:15:57,730
Please.

1068
01:16:00,839 --> 01:16:02,739
Strip, dammit!

1069
01:16:03,208 --> 01:16:05,699
Hurry it up!

1070
01:16:17,523 --> 01:16:18,512
What's up, Benny?

1071
01:16:19,258 --> 01:16:20,816
This camera for a bag of coke?

1072
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:22,618
I don't deal anymore.

1073
01:16:22,861 --> 01:16:25,659
C'mon, do it for me.
You're my friend.

1074
01:16:25,864 --> 01:16:28,025
-Is it stolen?
-It's okay, it's my dad's.

1075
01:16:28,534 --> 01:16:29,660
Your dad's?

1076
01:16:32,571 --> 01:16:33,731
Give it to Li値 Ze.

1077
01:16:34,039 --> 01:16:35,165
Rocket would love this camera.

1078
01:16:35,441 --> 01:16:39,434
-Yeah, here.
-Great.

1079
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,837
Here I am!

1080
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:12,834
-You wanna be a photographer?
-Yeah.

1081
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:14,611
Here's a present.

1082
01:17:15,014 --> 01:17:17,847
Shit, dude! This is great!

1083
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:21,019
Now move your ass.

1084
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,312
Shake it!

1085
01:17:42,041 --> 01:17:43,702
You'll take some great
pictures.

1086
01:17:46,779 --> 01:17:47,507
Give me that.

1087
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:50,271
-Give me back the camera!
-No!

1088
01:17:53,986 --> 01:17:56,682
What's your problem?
Are you craz?

1089
01:18:37,162 --> 01:18:38,720
They've killed Benny!

1090
01:18:41,033 --> 01:18:43,866
Fuck! Call an ambulance!

1091
01:18:44,403 --> 01:18:47,270
Where's the motherfucker
who did it?

1092
01:18:48,774 --> 01:18:50,503
Ze, Benny is dead.

1093
01:18:50,709 --> 01:18:53,109
No! Call a doctor!

1094
01:18:58,617 --> 01:19:01,518
Get out of here, bitch!
It's your fault!

1095
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:05,813
Motherfucker!

1096
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,909
Where's Carrot?

1097
01:19:34,119 --> 01:19:36,019
Blacky's here.

1098
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:40,151
He's in trouble.

1099
01:19:43,162 --> 01:19:44,720
I'm fucked.

1100
01:19:45,164 --> 01:19:47,155
-Why?
-I'm fucked.

1101
01:19:47,633 --> 01:19:48,565
And you are too.

1102
01:19:48,967 --> 01:19:50,332
I think I killed Benny.

1103
01:19:50,936 --> 01:19:52,528
Li値 Ze's coming
to take your place.

1104
01:19:52,938 --> 01:19:55,168
We can get him,
he's in the dance hall.

1105
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:56,839
You killed Benny?

1106
01:19:57,176 --> 01:19:59,838
I didn't mean to. He moved.
I was aiming at Li値 Ze.

1107
01:20:00,345 --> 01:20:02,142
Come on, let's go.

1108
01:20:02,347 --> 01:20:03,439
Blacky.

1109
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:08,349
You killed the coolest
hood in the City of God.

1110
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:10,453
Let's go get Li値 Ze.

1111
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:20,793
Carrot knew
that without Benny

1112
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:22,966
only a miracle
could save his business.

1113
01:20:24,269 --> 01:20:25,668
We're fucked, man.

1114
01:20:36,682 --> 01:20:37,706
But what better place

1115
01:20:38,283 --> 01:20:42,276
for a miracle to happen
than in the City of God?

1116
01:20:45,524 --> 01:20:47,355
Look who's here.
My sugar babe.

1117
01:20:47,659 --> 01:20:49,217
-Let me by.
-Gimme a kiss, girl.

1118
01:20:49,528 --> 01:20:52,224
Let me by, please. Have you
seen what you look like?

1119
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:53,920
Come on, Li値 Ze.

1120
01:21:06,578 --> 01:21:07,772
Hi, honey.

1121
01:21:08,046 --> 01:21:09,570
Everything okay, baby?

1122
01:21:17,256 --> 01:21:19,451
The problem was simple.

1123
01:21:19,758 --> 01:21:21,953
Li値 Ze was ugly.

1124
01:21:22,361 --> 01:21:24,056
Knockout Ned was handsome.

1125
01:21:24,263 --> 01:21:26,458
Knockout Ned
could get any girl.

1126
01:21:26,765 --> 01:21:30,257
Li値 Ze had to pay
or use force.

1127
01:21:31,169 --> 01:21:33,797
It was a duel between
the handsome good guy

1128
01:21:34,873 --> 01:21:36,465
and the ugly bad guy.

1129
01:21:37,276 --> 01:21:38,402
Let me go!

1130
01:21:42,414 --> 01:21:43,813
Just enjoy it.

1131
01:21:50,422 --> 01:21:53,118
You're mine now.

1132
01:21:56,161 --> 01:22:00,427
Hey, faggot,
your broad's really hot!

1133
01:22:31,997 --> 01:22:34,261
I can't even
look her in the face now.

1134
01:22:44,609 --> 01:22:47,703
Why didn't that fucker kill me?

1135
01:22:52,017 --> 01:22:52,915
Hold on.

1136
01:22:53,652 --> 01:22:55,517
Why didn't I kill that fucker?

1137
01:22:56,655 --> 01:22:58,247
Let's go back.

1138
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:01,526
-What about Carrot?
-We'll get back to him.

1139
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:02,856
You gonna kill him?

1140
01:23:06,531 --> 01:23:08,362
Knockout Ned,
your chick's a slut.

1141
01:23:08,767 --> 01:23:10,325
Come out, motherfucker!

1142
01:23:11,036 --> 01:23:12,435
Come out, you loser!

1143
01:23:12,637 --> 01:23:14,127
Take it easy.

1144
01:23:16,441 --> 01:23:17,772
I'm going out. Let me go.

1145
01:23:17,976 --> 01:23:19,534
Gerson! Come back, son!

1146
01:23:46,738 --> 01:23:50,697
This doesn't concern you, kid.
We're here for your brother.

1147
01:23:50,909 --> 01:23:53,901
Let's talk, we can work it out.
My brother's a peaceful guy.

1148
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:56,842
Is he too good-looking
to come talk to me? Call him.

1149
01:23:57,816 --> 01:23:59,010
He hasn't done anything.

1150
01:23:59,651 --> 01:24:00,913
You know who I am?

1151
01:24:01,253 --> 01:24:05,917
-Li値 Ze, man.
-He's Li値 Ze.

1152
01:24:06,925 --> 01:24:08,859
Call that motherfucker!

1153
01:24:09,061 --> 01:24:11,222
Go on, man.

1154
01:24:17,736 --> 01:24:19,169
Calm down, I'll call him.

1155
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:23,036
My arm!

1156
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:56,736
I hurt my arm.
Carrot will have to wait.

1157
01:24:57,008 --> 01:24:59,135
That loser got what he
deserved.

1158
01:24:59,911 --> 01:25:00,900
Let's go!

1159
01:25:25,637 --> 01:25:27,662
Gerson.

1160
01:25:30,142 --> 01:25:32,576
That bastard killed my brother.

1161
01:25:34,179 --> 01:25:36,943
I can't let that go.

1162
01:25:53,198 --> 01:25:53,892
Want a gun?

1163
01:25:59,838 --> 01:26:00,805
My son.

1164
01:26:02,707 --> 01:26:03,605
Calm down, mom.

1165
01:26:05,644 --> 01:26:06,110
Please, mom.

1166
01:26:18,623 --> 01:26:20,523
Do it right, asshole.

1167
01:26:21,526 --> 01:26:22,322
There's no other way.

1168
01:26:22,527 --> 01:26:24,654
How'd I let that loser hit me?

1169
01:26:25,230 --> 01:26:26,720
Shit, that's some hole.

1170
01:26:57,195 --> 01:27:00,494
-It's as if we were brothers.
-Shut up.

1171
01:27:00,699 --> 01:27:02,792
Both of us hurt in the arm.
You by one brother, me the
other.

1172
01:27:03,501 --> 01:27:05,128
It would be really funny
if we were brothers.

1173
01:27:05,337 --> 01:27:10,798
That Knockout Ned's
not bad, eh?

1174
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:14,608
He came out of nowhere.

1175
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:18,908
Shut up, Tuba!
You're a fucking pain!

1176
01:27:27,525 --> 01:27:31,359
It was as if the City of God
had suddenly found a hero.

1177
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:33,024
God bless you, son.

1178
01:27:33,765 --> 01:27:36,233
That kid was just asking
to be killed.

1179
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:37,635
Well done.

1180
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:39,326
You did a good job.

1181
01:27:40,038 --> 01:27:41,938
You'd better go hide.

1182
01:27:50,282 --> 01:27:53,012
I thought Knockout Ned
would start a revolution here.

1183
01:27:53,585 --> 01:27:56,110
But God had other plans.

1184
01:27:56,588 --> 01:27:57,520
Steak,

1185
01:27:57,889 --> 01:28:00,119
where are all the dealers?

1186
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:02,922
They're hiding.
Li値 Ze is in a bad mood.

1187
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:07,226
They get us hooked and then
they go off and hide.

1188
01:28:07,899 --> 01:28:10,925
Do me a favor.
Go get some nose candy for me.

1189
01:28:11,236 --> 01:28:12,498
I'll try.

1190
01:28:12,837 --> 01:28:16,000
Tell them it's for Tiago,
to keep my buzz going.

1191
01:28:37,062 --> 01:28:37,960
Steak'n'fries,

1192
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:41,062
go to Carrot's and tell him.

1193
01:28:42,867 --> 01:28:47,065
Li値 Ze says that if you kill
Knockout, he'll leave you alone.

1194
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:50,871
Hey, Knockout Ned.
Did you hear that?

1195
01:28:51,776 --> 01:28:53,266
Grab the kid!

1196
01:28:56,481 --> 01:28:57,880
You heard the boy?

1197
01:28:58,316 --> 01:29:00,477
If you don't stick with us,
you're dead.

1198
01:29:00,685 --> 01:29:02,084
I think you should join us.

1199
01:29:02,487 --> 01:29:05,115
We'll be partners.

1200
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:06,286
Drugs aren't my thing.

1201
01:29:06,491 --> 01:29:08,584
This is just something
between me and him.

1202
01:29:09,494 --> 01:29:11,325
Those guys aren't worth shit.

1203
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:18,325
They'll do anything for power.

1204
01:29:20,038 --> 01:29:21,528
Like this kid.

1205
01:29:22,907 --> 01:29:26,707
They're all robots,
like this punk here.

1206
01:29:26,911 --> 01:29:28,310
What's in your head, kid?

1207
01:29:28,513 --> 01:29:30,708
Can't you see
you're wrecking your life

1208
01:29:30,915 --> 01:29:37,320
with that maniac and a bunch
of trigger-happy fools?

1209
01:29:38,156 --> 01:29:41,717
Are you craz?
You're just a kid.

1210
01:29:41,926 --> 01:29:44,656
A kid? I smoke, snort,

1211
01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:47,828
I've killed and robbed.
I'm a man.

1212
01:29:48,266 --> 01:29:50,325
Shit, you have no idea!

1213
01:29:51,369 --> 01:29:55,533
He's attached to his gang.
You should join up with us.

1214
01:29:56,141 --> 01:29:58,234
Shall we kill him?

1215
01:30:01,446 --> 01:30:03,937
Steak,
we're going to grind you.

1216
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:07,975
Okay, I accept.

1217
01:30:08,753 --> 01:30:09,447
Great!

1218
01:30:10,588 --> 01:30:11,179
Tell your boss

1219
01:30:11,456 --> 01:30:13,651
that Knockout Ned and Carrot
are now in command.

1220
01:30:14,058 --> 01:30:15,389
But on one condition :

1221
01:30:17,796 --> 01:30:20,458
no killing of innocent people.

1222
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:22,155
I can't accept that,
understand?

1223
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,664
Okay, no innocent people.

1224
01:30:26,371 --> 01:30:29,363
Steak fucked up!

1225
01:30:43,254 --> 01:30:44,346
Have you a gun for me?

1226
01:30:44,622 --> 01:30:48,854
No, but we can hold up
a gun store.

1227
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:50,852
That's no problem.

1228
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:53,158
I don't want to hold up
anything.

1229
01:30:53,665 --> 01:30:54,859
I'm not a hoodlum.

1230
01:30:55,533 --> 01:30:59,264
This is a personal affair
between me and him, okay?

1231
01:30:59,771 --> 01:31:01,636
I'm not a hoodlum.

1232
01:31:04,175 --> 01:31:05,767
He raped your chick,

1233
01:31:06,177 --> 01:31:09,840
killed your uncle and brother,
gunned your house,

1234
01:31:10,181 --> 01:31:14,174
and you killed one of his guys.

1235
01:31:14,752 --> 01:31:19,451
If you're not a hood,
then get out.

1236
01:31:32,403 --> 01:31:34,394
This is a hold-up!

1237
01:31:43,114 --> 01:31:44,308
The first time...

1238
01:31:44,816 --> 01:31:46,113
Where are the revolvers?

1239
01:31:46,651 --> 01:31:50,519
Knockout Ned saved a salesclerk
form being shot by Carrot.

1240
01:31:50,722 --> 01:31:52,212
We said no killing!

1241
01:31:52,724 --> 01:31:54,351
That's the rule.

1242
01:31:58,363 --> 01:32:02,766
We want the boss's money.
Everyone keep calm.

1243
01:32:03,167 --> 01:32:06,364
You want us to go? We do too.

1244
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:11,170
Look at the ground!

1245
01:32:11,576 --> 01:32:17,845
The second time, Carrot saved
Knockout Ned's life.

1246
01:32:18,049 --> 01:32:21,143
Ned learned that there's
an exception to every rule.

1247
01:32:21,586 --> 01:32:24,453
Exception to the rule.

1248
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:27,151
-Are you the manager?
-Yes.

1249
01:32:27,592 --> 01:32:29,184
This is a hold-up.

1250
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:30,859
Everyone on the ground!

1251
01:32:31,162 --> 01:32:34,859
On the ground!

1252
01:32:35,166 --> 01:32:41,162
Give me the money!

1253
01:32:41,472 --> 01:32:42,871
I'm not kidding.

1254
01:32:43,308 --> 01:32:45,799
The first person who moves
is dead!

1255
01:32:46,244 --> 01:32:49,509
The third time,
the exception becomes the rule.

1256
01:33:05,630 --> 01:33:07,120
With the hold-up money

1257
01:33:07,332 --> 01:33:09,732
Carrot and Knockout Ned
prepared to face Li値 Ze.

1258
01:33:10,134 --> 01:33:11,761
Carrot could protect
his business.

1259
01:33:13,338 --> 01:33:14,828
Knockout Ned,

1260
01:33:15,139 --> 01:33:17,937
the best marksman in his
battalion, wanted revenge.

1261
01:33:18,176 --> 01:33:21,839
First, the Italians.
This is a 9 mm.

1262
01:33:22,146 --> 01:33:23,841
-Let me see.
-Not bad, eh?

1263
01:33:24,148 --> 01:33:25,240
The sight isn't well-aligned.

1264
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:28,241
I'll give you a good price.

1265
01:33:28,753 --> 01:33:29,845
The 12mm.
The ''hand job''.

1266
01:33:30,188 --> 01:33:33,453
See why?

1267
01:33:33,958 --> 01:33:38,258
An Uzi, 9mm. It's Israeli.

1268
01:33:38,763 --> 01:33:40,355
The star of David.

1269
01:33:40,865 --> 01:33:41,763
Jewish.

1270
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,160
I want a 30-06.

1271
01:33:43,534 --> 01:33:47,095
Now we can start having fun.

1272
01:33:47,538 --> 01:33:50,837
The war's on.
Let's start with a prayer.

1273
01:33:51,309 --> 01:33:54,801
Our father who art in heaven,

1274
01:33:55,113 --> 01:33:57,411
Hallowed be thy name...

1275
01:34:15,533 --> 01:34:17,364
Hoodlums have guns,
but can't shoot.

1276
01:34:17,869 --> 01:34:19,530
One bullet from Knockout Ned

1277
01:34:19,771 --> 01:34:21,762
was worth ten
from Li値 Ze's gang.

1278
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:23,764
Li値 Ze couldn't take it.

1279
01:34:24,175 --> 01:34:26,040
He counter-attacked.

1280
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:31,642
The slum had been a purgatory,
now it was hell.

1281
01:34:31,683 --> 01:34:33,048
I decided to get out.

1282
01:34:37,255 --> 01:34:42,659
That's how I became a reporter.

1283
01:34:43,795 --> 01:34:46,491
Great photo!

1284
01:34:46,731 --> 01:34:49,598
I bet it's by Rogerio Reis.

1285
01:34:49,834 --> 01:34:52,496
What did I tell you?

1286
01:34:52,804 --> 01:34:54,499
Like any pro,

1287
01:34:54,706 --> 01:34:58,142
I started at the bottom,
way down at the bottom.

1288
01:34:58,509 --> 01:35:03,412
Without knowing
what awaited me.

1289
01:35:03,648 --> 01:35:06,515
Instead of going home
I'd go over to the paper.

1290
01:35:06,718 --> 01:35:09,915
A guy from the City of God
worked in the lab.

1291
01:35:10,154 --> 01:35:12,418
Check this out.

1292
01:35:12,657 --> 01:35:14,249
He helped me

1293
01:35:14,525 --> 01:35:17,050
move closer
to what I loved most in life.

1294
01:35:17,328 --> 01:35:19,319
-Hi, Rogerio.
-How are you, Pierre?

1295
01:35:19,564 --> 01:35:21,862
This is Rocket.
He's a photographer.

1296
01:35:22,133 --> 01:35:23,361
Hello, Rocket.

1297
01:35:23,668 --> 01:35:25,932
-He's a fan of yours.
-Really?

1298
01:35:26,170 --> 01:35:27,569
You have good taste, Rocket!

1299
01:35:27,839 --> 01:35:30,831
-Well, I'm done. I'm off.
-See you.

1300
01:35:31,042 --> 01:35:33,840
What a cool guy!

1301
01:35:34,746 --> 01:35:37,738
What should have been
a swift revenge

1302
01:35:37,982 --> 01:35:39,950
turned into an all-out war.

1303
01:35:45,590 --> 01:35:47,683
The City of God was divided.

1304
01:35:47,992 --> 01:35:51,689
You couldn't go
from one section to the other.

1305
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:54,089
Not even to visit a relative.

1306
01:35:54,332 --> 01:35:58,029
The cops considered anyone
living in the slum a hoodlum.

1307
01:35:58,302 --> 01:36:01,237
People got used to living
in Vietnam.

1308
01:36:06,210 --> 01:36:11,147
And more and more volunteers
kept signing up to die.

1309
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:12,312
This kid...

1310
01:36:12,517 --> 01:36:12,949
What do you want?

1311
01:36:13,251 --> 01:36:14,912
A boy from Carrot's gang
punched me.

1312
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:17,314
The war was an excuse
for everything.

1313
01:36:17,555 --> 01:36:19,523
Li値 Ze's soldiers
kicked my ass.

1314
01:36:19,724 --> 01:36:23,353
Take this .22.

1315
01:36:25,263 --> 01:36:28,755
The jerk who raped my sister
is with Carrot.

1316
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:29,761
Li値 Ze evicted my family.

1317
01:36:30,067 --> 01:36:32,934
Kill...
Be respected.

1318
01:36:45,583 --> 01:36:46,709
I'm Tiago, a friend of Benny's.

1319
01:36:46,984 --> 01:36:49,475
Can you read? Can you add?

1320
01:36:49,987 --> 01:36:52,888
I'm pretty good in business.

1321
01:36:53,925 --> 01:36:55,688
Okay, get to work.

1322
01:36:55,893 --> 01:36:56,689
What do you want?

1323
01:36:56,994 --> 01:36:59,485
To get my father's murderer.

1324
01:36:59,797 --> 01:37:00,627
What's your name?

1325
01:37:00,898 --> 01:37:03,093
My name's Otto.

1326
01:37:07,939 --> 01:37:09,907
What's the matter?

1327
01:37:10,107 --> 01:37:12,837
-He's a worker.
-But he wants a gun.

1328
01:37:13,110 --> 01:37:15,135
He won't last a week.

1329
01:37:28,526 --> 01:37:30,926
A year later, no one remembered

1330
01:37:31,162 --> 01:37:33,130
how it had all begun.

1331
01:37:33,364 --> 01:37:34,331
Take that!

1332
01:37:37,735 --> 01:37:40,727
For both sides, the aim was

1333
01:37:40,938 --> 01:37:43,771
to take over the enemy's
business in order to buy

1334
01:37:44,075 --> 01:37:46,771
more guns and take over
more businesses.

1335
01:38:10,501 --> 01:38:11,991
I smoke, snort,
I've killed and robbed.

1336
01:38:12,236 --> 01:38:13,134
I'm a man.

1337
01:38:36,661 --> 01:38:39,027
The media started
taking an interest.

1338
01:38:39,263 --> 01:38:41,163
The police had to intervene.

1339
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:57,012
A gang leader

1340
01:38:57,281 --> 01:39:00,011
from the City of God
was arrested today.

1341
01:39:00,284 --> 01:39:02,013
Manuel Machado,
aka Knockout Ned,

1342
01:39:02,286 --> 01:39:05,278
was hospitalized after being
wounded by Li値 Ze's gang.

1343
01:39:05,489 --> 01:39:08,083
Our reporter interviewed him.

1344
01:39:08,292 --> 01:39:10,226
Is the war
still going on?

1345
01:39:10,494 --> 01:39:12,086
It's still going on.

1346
01:39:12,496 --> 01:39:14,293
Have many people died?

1347
01:39:14,598 --> 01:39:16,793
Many have died.

1348
01:39:17,034 --> 01:39:18,899
Mostly innocent people.

1349
01:39:19,236 --> 01:39:22,797
Just knowing me is enough

1350
01:39:23,107 --> 01:39:27,737
to get you killed by Li値 Ze.

1351
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:29,012
The police don't go in there?

1352
01:39:29,246 --> 01:39:33,649
They go after me, not him.

1353
01:39:33,918 --> 01:39:37,911
I've been in jail, while he
goes on killing undisturbed.

1354
01:39:38,122 --> 01:39:40,147
And they don't arrest him.

1355
01:39:40,424 --> 01:39:42,654
Knockout Ned says
the war will continue.

1356
01:39:42,927 --> 01:39:44,758
Police Chief Guedes

1357
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:47,963
has promised
to arrest both of the gangs.

1358
01:39:57,141 --> 01:39:58,972
Motherfucker!

1359
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:03,339
I'm the boss here, but he gets
his picture in the paper!

1360
01:40:03,581 --> 01:40:06,573
-Have you found mine?
-Just Knockout Ned's.

1361
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:08,445
Keep looking.

1362
01:40:08,652 --> 01:40:11,450
At least my name's
got to be in there.

1363
01:40:11,655 --> 01:40:12,952
-There's nothing.
-Can you read?

1364
01:40:13,157 --> 01:40:15,648
Just the pictures.

1365
01:40:16,761 --> 01:40:17,659
Nothing.

1366
01:40:19,363 --> 01:40:22,059
Hey, what the fuck
are you doing?

1367
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:23,460
It's just the want ads.

1368
01:40:23,768 --> 01:40:26,862
I don't care, read everything!

1369
01:40:27,171 --> 01:40:28,866
But there aren't any articles.

1370
01:40:29,173 --> 01:40:31,164
Want a bullet in your head?

1371
01:40:33,811 --> 01:40:36,371
Gotta show them
who's boss here.

1372
01:40:42,219 --> 01:40:44,050
-Give me the camera!
-No way!

1373
01:40:48,426 --> 01:40:49,916
Take my picture, man.

1374
01:40:50,127 --> 01:40:52,254
I can't work it.

1375
01:40:53,431 --> 01:40:54,261
Go ahead.

1376
01:40:54,532 --> 01:40:55,965
I'll hold the Beretta.

1377
01:40:57,134 --> 01:40:59,329
Let me try.

1378
01:40:59,570 --> 01:41:01,538
Back off.

1379
01:41:01,839 --> 01:41:03,739
There's no click.

1380
01:41:05,943 --> 01:41:07,843
What a bunch of bozos!

1381
01:41:08,145 --> 01:41:12,172
I'm fucked, with you guys.

1382
01:41:12,450 --> 01:41:14,577
I have an idea.

1383
01:41:14,785 --> 01:41:20,348
I'll go get a guy I know.
Hang loose.

1384
01:41:21,959 --> 01:41:25,190
Here he is.

1385
01:41:27,164 --> 01:41:28,256
Take the camera.

1386
01:41:28,599 --> 01:41:30,464
Well, kid?

1387
01:41:30,768 --> 01:41:32,463
Aren't you a photographer?

1388
01:41:32,703 --> 01:41:35,672
Make the camera work.
We can't do it.

1389
01:41:35,873 --> 01:41:37,272
Take our picture.

1390
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:47,951
-You fucking broke it.
-It wasn't me.

1391
01:41:48,252 --> 01:41:49,719
I found it.

1392
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:54,354
It has to be wound.

1393
01:41:59,163 --> 01:42:00,357
What's your name?

1394
01:42:00,664 --> 01:42:01,858
Rocket.

1395
01:42:02,133 --> 01:42:04,761
Another picture, Rocket.

1396
01:42:05,035 --> 01:42:06,764
How about two rows?

1397
01:42:07,037 --> 01:42:08,231
What?

1398
01:42:08,572 --> 01:42:09,561
Two rows.
Everyone with their guns.

1399
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,933
You're outside,
for Christ's sake!

1400
01:42:12,243 --> 01:42:14,677
Talk to him nicely, kid.

1401
01:42:14,945 --> 01:42:18,142
Sorry.
Move in, please.

1402
01:42:21,252 --> 01:42:23,584
Another one.

1403
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:31,186
I think the roll's finished.

1404
01:42:31,462 --> 01:42:32,759
Then show us the pictures.

1405
01:42:32,963 --> 01:42:34,760
They have to be developed.

1406
01:42:34,999 --> 01:42:36,864
Developed?

1407
01:42:37,168 --> 01:42:39,068
How much is it?

1408
01:42:39,370 --> 01:42:40,997
Take this money.

1409
01:42:41,272 --> 01:42:43,297
And bring back the pictures.

1410
01:42:43,607 --> 01:42:46,041
I have to remove the film.

1411
01:42:46,310 --> 01:42:49,245
Keep the camera.

1412
01:42:49,513 --> 01:42:51,413
Benny wanted to give it to you,
didn't he?

1413
01:42:51,649 --> 01:42:53,344
-It's yours.
-Thanks.

1414
01:42:55,119 --> 01:42:57,519
Don't forget the pictures.

1415
01:42:57,721 --> 01:42:59,814
The photos, Rocket!

1416
01:43:10,334 --> 01:43:13,030
-Pierre!
-What?

1417
01:43:13,337 --> 01:43:15,931
Can you develop this for me?

1418
01:43:17,374 --> 01:43:20,434
I can't, Rocket.
I could get into trouble.

1419
01:43:20,744 --> 01:43:23,645
It's only for the paper's
reporters. I could risk my job.

1420
01:43:23,847 --> 01:43:25,041
-Pierre?
-Yes, Rogerio?

1421
01:43:25,382 --> 01:43:27,247
Develop these for me.

1422
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:29,578
This one too, okay?

1423
01:43:29,753 --> 01:43:31,948
I'm going to lunch.

1424
01:43:33,390 --> 01:43:37,156
You're lucky.
What size?

1425
01:43:37,394 --> 01:43:38,258
What?

1426
01:43:38,596 --> 01:43:41,064
For the enlargement, what size?

1427
01:43:41,365 --> 01:43:44,801
Well...
Whatever you think is best.

1428
01:44:09,526 --> 01:44:10,652
-Here.
-Thanks.

1429
01:44:10,928 --> 01:44:12,327
I'm in deep shit now.

1430
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:16,860
I'm as good as dead.

1431
01:44:29,346 --> 01:44:31,576
Someone had signed
my death sentence.

1432
01:44:31,749 --> 01:44:35,241
I wanted to bash the jerk's
face in.

1433
01:44:40,858 --> 01:44:43,224
Are you Marina?
You stole my photos.

1434
01:44:43,527 --> 01:44:46,519
Because of you,
I'm dead.

1435
01:44:46,797 --> 01:44:48,492
Dead? Stole? What do you mean?

1436
01:44:48,632 --> 01:44:50,691
Not so loud.

1437
01:44:50,901 --> 01:44:53,893
Not so loud?
I'll be killed because of you.

1438
01:44:54,238 --> 01:44:57,503
You were gone,
your photos were in the lab.

1439
01:44:57,741 --> 01:44:59,208
There's nothing I can do.

1440
01:44:59,510 --> 01:45:01,205
The photos in our lab

1441
01:45:01,512 --> 01:45:03,241
are photos to be published
in the paper.

1442
01:45:03,514 --> 01:45:06,711
I saw the photos,
I published them.

1443
01:45:06,950 --> 01:45:07,541
You stole them.

1444
01:45:07,818 --> 01:45:09,649
I did not. Here they are.

1445
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:11,114
-Give them to me.
-Just a second.

1446
01:45:11,355 --> 01:45:14,950
Here are your photos.

1447
01:45:15,225 --> 01:45:18,717
Are there any others?

1448
01:45:18,962 --> 01:45:21,624
Calm down.
What's your name?

1449
01:45:21,865 --> 01:45:24,766
-Rocket.
-Rocket?

1450
01:45:25,736 --> 01:45:27,966
Nice to meet you.
I'm Marina.

1451
01:45:28,339 --> 01:45:31,831
Now, relax.
I have money for you.

1452
01:45:32,142 --> 01:45:34,235
For your pictures.

1453
01:45:34,578 --> 01:45:36,978
Here, when we use a picture

1454
01:45:37,247 --> 01:45:39,181
we pay the photographer.

1455
01:45:39,450 --> 01:45:40,940
Do you want to be
a photographer?

1456
01:45:41,185 --> 01:45:42,447
Yes.

1457
01:45:42,653 --> 01:45:44,484
Great start!
On the front page.

1458
01:45:44,788 --> 01:45:46,483
How'd you get these photos?

1459
01:45:46,690 --> 01:45:48,590
I live there.

1460
01:45:48,826 --> 01:45:52,922
Rocket, no photographer has ever
been able to go in there.

1461
01:45:54,098 --> 01:45:56,293
If you could bring us
more pictures of Li値 Ze,

1462
01:45:56,500 --> 01:46:00,937
the paper would buy them.

1463
01:46:01,205 --> 01:46:03,696
We'd pay you.

1464
01:46:03,941 --> 01:46:06,307
Could you?

1465
01:46:06,510 --> 01:46:08,410
I don't know.

1466
01:46:08,645 --> 01:46:10,112
What's the problem?

1467
01:46:10,347 --> 01:46:13,111
The problem? I can't go there
anymore at night.

1468
01:46:13,317 --> 01:46:15,512
And during the day?

1469
01:46:15,719 --> 01:46:17,346
It's too risky.

1470
01:46:19,656 --> 01:46:23,956
Look, man! They've finally
understood that I'm the boss.

1471
01:46:26,330 --> 01:46:28,764
What's your
photographer-friend's name?

1472
01:46:29,066 --> 01:46:29,760
Rocket.

1473
01:46:30,033 --> 01:46:32,763
He's good. I'll take more
to show the others.

1474
01:46:35,839 --> 01:46:39,741
So, Rocket,
is it yes or no?

1475
01:46:40,944 --> 01:46:42,844
It's a great opportunity.

1476
01:46:46,517 --> 01:46:47,779
Okay.

1477
01:46:49,219 --> 01:46:50,618
You made the right choice.

1478
01:46:50,888 --> 01:46:52,082
Very good!

1479
01:46:52,489 --> 01:46:55,083
I'll give you some film,
lenses,

1480
01:46:55,325 --> 01:46:58,783
and even another camera. I'll
show you the equipment room.

1481
01:46:59,897 --> 01:47:03,025
There's another problem.

1482
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:06,292
-What is it?
-Where can I sleep tonight?

1483
01:47:07,037 --> 01:47:09,938
I can't go back now.

1484
01:47:12,509 --> 01:47:15,239
This is a 135mm.

1485
01:47:15,512 --> 01:47:17,139
Will you be close up
or far away?

1486
01:47:17,414 --> 01:47:18,142
Far away.

1487
01:47:18,415 --> 01:47:20,508
-Can you measure the light?
-Yes.

1488
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:27,115
Aren't you too close?

1489
01:47:28,525 --> 01:47:31,517
I don't know what spurred me
to go talk to them like that.

1490
01:47:32,529 --> 01:47:34,656
Maybe I was going to die,

1491
01:47:34,932 --> 01:47:38,265
but now I had a camera

1492
01:47:38,535 --> 01:47:41,663
and a chance
to become a photographer.

1493
01:47:41,939 --> 01:47:44,464
Watch out for the dog shit.

1494
01:47:44,775 --> 01:47:48,074
Not to mention that
the night was still young.

1495
01:47:48,479 --> 01:47:50,276
Want something to eat?

1496
01:47:50,514 --> 01:47:51,708
No, thank you, ma'am.

1497
01:47:51,982 --> 01:47:55,213
Nothing to eat?
Nothing to drink?

1498
01:47:55,486 --> 01:47:56,578
Ajoint?

1499
01:47:56,820 --> 01:47:58,811
Try this.

1500
01:48:19,243 --> 01:48:21,302
It's time to go to sleep.

1501
01:48:23,514 --> 01:48:26,915
I'll show you your bed.

1502
01:48:27,150 --> 01:48:28,708
You have hot water, don't you?

1503
01:48:28,952 --> 01:48:32,513
Yes. You've never
taken a hot shower?

1504
01:48:32,723 --> 01:48:34,918
-No.
-What do you do?

1505
01:48:35,125 --> 01:48:38,356
We heat up the kettle.

1506
01:48:38,662 --> 01:48:40,152
Why are you standing there?

1507
01:48:40,430 --> 01:48:42,330
What room do I sleep in?

1508
01:48:42,566 --> 01:48:47,060
Unfortunately,
there's only one room.

1509
01:48:47,471 --> 01:48:48,768
You have to sleep with me.

1510
01:48:49,072 --> 01:48:52,473
I won't go into the details
of my first sexual experience.

1511
01:48:52,776 --> 01:48:54,471
Just relax.

1512
01:48:56,580 --> 01:48:58,605
Because, elsewhere

1513
01:48:58,882 --> 01:49:01,476
another more important
sex scene for the slum

1514
01:49:01,785 --> 01:49:04,618
was taking place.

1515
01:49:04,888 --> 01:49:07,686
Carrot was helping
Knockout Ned escape

1516
01:49:07,925 --> 01:49:10,291
without firing a shot.

1517
01:49:11,495 --> 01:49:12,826
The policeman guarding him

1518
01:49:13,096 --> 01:49:15,826
was in the willing hands
of the nurse.

1519
01:49:16,099 --> 01:49:18,090
And in the meantime

1520
01:49:20,203 --> 01:49:22,603
to eliminate Carrot, Li値 Ze
was investing in munitions.

1521
01:49:22,839 --> 01:49:26,036
He invested heavily,
even if he couldn't pay.

1522
01:49:27,110 --> 01:49:28,304
Remember the double-barrel?

1523
01:49:28,612 --> 01:49:30,307
I already have it.

1524
01:49:30,547 --> 01:49:32,208
This is a repeater rifle.

1525
01:49:32,549 --> 01:49:35,541
You don't have this one,
the Browning.

1526
01:49:35,752 --> 01:49:36,548
It'll shoot down a plane.

1527
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:38,950
I'm not shooting down planes.
And the one I asked for?

1528
01:49:39,222 --> 01:49:42,749
The AR-15, Uncle Sam.

1529
01:49:43,026 --> 01:49:46,223
You can't get them in Brazil.

1530
01:49:46,563 --> 01:49:48,030
My ass, Uncle Sam.

1531
01:49:50,934 --> 01:49:53,027
I have a solution.

1532
01:49:53,337 --> 01:49:55,134
The Rugger. Ever seen one?

1533
01:49:55,372 --> 01:49:59,832
It's like the AR-15.
Same caliber, but lighter.

1534
01:50:00,143 --> 01:50:03,237
With an infrared sight?
400 shots a minute?

1535
01:50:03,647 --> 01:50:04,443
It depends.

1536
01:50:04,748 --> 01:50:06,238
It depends, my ass!

1537
01:50:06,483 --> 01:50:09,475
Trying to fuck me over?

1538
01:50:09,753 --> 01:50:11,345
I'll fuck you over first.

1539
01:50:11,655 --> 01:50:15,648
You leave now
without the money or the guns.

1540
01:50:15,859 --> 01:50:17,258
What do I tell the boss?

1541
01:50:17,461 --> 01:50:18,485
That's your problem.

1542
01:50:18,762 --> 01:50:20,457
You'll think of something.

1543
01:50:20,764 --> 01:50:23,062
You heard him, chubby?
Get out.

1544
01:50:23,367 --> 01:50:26,393
Beat it, fatso.

1545
01:50:26,670 --> 01:50:28,262
Li値 Ze had made a big mistake.

1546
01:50:28,672 --> 01:50:29,661
He should have known

1547
01:50:29,873 --> 01:50:32,899
that behind every salesman
lies a supplier.

1548
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:35,178
And they don't joke around.

1549
01:50:36,813 --> 01:50:39,475
Have you seen this?

1550
01:50:39,683 --> 01:50:41,913
What do they need an AR-15 for?

1551
01:50:42,219 --> 01:50:43,948
These stories will push
the police to investigate.

1552
01:50:44,221 --> 01:50:48,021
They'll nab you.
And me, along with you.

1553
01:50:48,325 --> 01:50:51,624
Think I'm going
to give you away?

1554
01:50:55,632 --> 01:50:58,430
Don't worry,
I'll take care of it.

1555
01:50:58,635 --> 01:51:00,569
But don't fuck up again.

1556
01:51:07,377 --> 01:51:08,639
Charlie!

1557
01:51:10,647 --> 01:51:12,581
Come here!

1558
01:51:12,849 --> 01:51:14,339
Listen,

1559
01:51:14,651 --> 01:51:16,243
you tell him.

1560
01:51:18,055 --> 01:51:21,149
Let's go make that sleaz
little dealer pay up.

1561
01:51:34,271 --> 01:51:36,068
Come here, kids!

1562
01:51:37,407 --> 01:51:39,705
Do you like chicken?

1563
01:51:40,010 --> 01:51:40,999
It depends.

1564
01:51:41,278 --> 01:51:42,870
We'll eat some chicken

1565
01:51:43,213 --> 01:51:44,805
and have Carrot for dessert.

1566
01:51:45,115 --> 01:51:47,015
I have a present for you.

1567
01:51:47,217 --> 01:51:48,115
Here.

1568
01:51:53,557 --> 01:51:55,548
A big one for you.

1569
01:51:55,759 --> 01:51:57,818
Are you really giving us
these guns?

1570
01:51:58,128 --> 01:52:02,724
Yes, but I want you on my side,
against Carrot.

1571
01:52:02,933 --> 01:52:04,764
Then can we hold up
anyone we want?

1572
01:52:05,035 --> 01:52:07,833
Not in the slum.

1573
01:52:08,138 --> 01:52:09,571
-Can you shoot?
-More or less.

1574
01:52:09,773 --> 01:52:10,762
More or less?

1575
01:52:11,041 --> 01:52:13,566
Hey, you guys,
come help these kids.

1576
01:52:13,844 --> 01:52:16,438
I know. You do it like this.

1577
01:52:37,667 --> 01:52:38,861
Get that chicken!

1578
01:52:40,670 --> 01:52:41,659
C'mon, let's go.

1579
01:52:52,816 --> 01:52:54,807
If Li値 Ze catches you,
he'll kill you.

1580
01:52:56,820 --> 01:52:59,618
Yeah, well,
he's gotta find me first.

1581
01:53:07,831 --> 01:53:10,823
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!

1582
01:53:13,570 --> 01:53:15,128
Shit! The cops!

1583
01:53:15,338 --> 01:53:17,738
Hell, don't fucking run off!

1584
01:53:18,041 --> 01:53:18,939
Give me that.

1585
01:53:30,654 --> 01:53:34,852
Hey, Melonhead!
You fucking fag!

1586
01:53:35,158 --> 01:53:36,250
Get the hell out of here!

1587
01:53:36,493 --> 01:53:37,653
Coward!

1588
01:53:37,961 --> 01:53:38,950
Asshole!

1589
01:53:42,666 --> 01:53:44,531
Come on,
let them kill each other.

1590
01:53:44,801 --> 01:53:47,326
They can fuck themselves.

1591
01:53:54,911 --> 01:53:57,505
Rocket! Take a picture of us!

1592
01:53:58,915 --> 01:54:00,610
What are you waiting for?

1593
01:54:21,438 --> 01:54:23,929
What's happening?

1594
01:54:24,174 --> 01:54:25,368
Shit!

1595
01:54:27,644 --> 01:54:29,168
Let's go!

1596
01:54:30,380 --> 01:54:32,644
Run! Run!

1597
01:54:35,785 --> 01:54:37,275
Watch out!

1598
01:54:39,656 --> 01:54:42,056
Kill one of these faggots!
Blast him!

1599
01:55:55,732 --> 01:55:56,699
Knockout Ned!

1600
01:55:58,301 --> 01:56:00,735
Take it easy. Don't move.

1601
01:56:01,037 --> 01:56:02,834
It hurts, man.

1602
01:56:03,106 --> 01:56:06,303
Easy does it, kid.

1603
01:56:06,609 --> 01:56:09,305
Why did you join
this fucking war?

1604
01:56:09,546 --> 01:56:10,410
Knockout Ned!

1605
01:56:10,714 --> 01:56:13,615
Li値 Ze's been hit. Come on!

1606
01:56:13,917 --> 01:56:14,713
Wait here, I'll help you.

1607
01:56:14,951 --> 01:56:15,918
Just hold on.

1608
01:56:26,129 --> 01:56:30,623
- What's your name?
-My name's Otto.

1609
01:56:37,474 --> 01:56:39,635
I want to get my father's
murderer.

1610
01:57:04,801 --> 01:57:07,326
Knockout Ned!
Li値 Ze's been hit. Come on!

1611
01:57:08,805 --> 01:57:09,601
I'll help you.

1612
01:57:09,839 --> 01:57:11,101
Just hold on there.

1613
01:57:53,883 --> 01:57:57,284
The fucking cops!

1614
01:57:57,520 --> 01:57:59,920
On the ground!

1615
01:58:00,223 --> 01:58:03,920
-Don't move!
-Hands over your head.

1616
01:58:07,730 --> 01:58:10,722
-You're the one I want.
-You're finished, pal.

1617
01:58:11,034 --> 01:58:11,932
Handcuff him.

1618
01:58:33,022 --> 01:58:34,614
Rocket, where are you going?

1619
01:58:34,824 --> 01:58:36,621
I got something to clear up.

1620
01:59:08,791 --> 01:59:10,224
Okay, lovebirds.

1621
01:59:10,493 --> 01:59:15,089
Come on, Li値 Ze,
let's go settle our scores.

1622
01:59:15,331 --> 01:59:17,993
Not you.
You're a present for the media.

1623
01:59:55,138 --> 01:59:56,435
Does it come to 10,000?

1624
01:59:56,739 --> 01:59:57,728
Almost. That's all I have.

1625
01:59:57,974 --> 01:59:59,771
That's all there was, Chief.

1626
02:00:00,043 --> 02:00:01,032
We searched everywhere.

1627
02:00:01,344 --> 02:00:03,244
Let him go.

1628
02:00:03,446 --> 02:00:05,573
What about this ring?
Is it gold?

1629
02:00:17,460 --> 02:00:18,859
Fill it up.
You'll owe us the rest.

1630
02:00:23,166 --> 02:00:24,656
Fucking war!

1631
02:00:27,670 --> 02:00:30,070
Knockout Ned is dead
and I'm dead broke!

1632
02:00:30,273 --> 02:00:32,673
You're fucked, eh?

1633
02:00:32,909 --> 02:00:34,399
Kids,

1634
02:00:34,677 --> 02:00:38,272
we'll have to do a few hold-ups
to get my business going again.

1635
02:00:38,681 --> 02:00:40,308
Your business, Li値 Ze?

1636
02:00:40,583 --> 02:00:42,881
What's your problem, kid?

1637
02:00:43,119 --> 02:00:44,552
This is for our friend,
motherfucker!

1638
02:00:44,821 --> 02:00:46,118
A Soviet attack!

1639
02:00:53,329 --> 02:00:55,422
The business is ours!

1640
02:01:50,153 --> 02:01:54,556
This picture of the hood
will guarantee my salary.

1641
02:01:56,726 --> 02:01:58,626
This one will make me famous.

1642
02:01:58,828 --> 02:02:00,318
It'll even make the cover
of a magazine.

1643
02:02:03,966 --> 02:02:05,627
I won't have to worry
about Li値 Ze anymore.

1644
02:02:09,439 --> 02:02:11,168
But the cops?

1645
02:02:19,649 --> 02:02:23,244
Gangster, Self-styled ''Boss''
Of The City Of God, Shot Dead

1646
02:02:28,291 --> 02:02:30,657
This photo could've
gotten us killed?

1647
02:02:30,893 --> 02:02:32,451
I think so.

1648
02:02:32,662 --> 02:02:34,152
A least it got you a job.

1649
02:02:35,665 --> 02:02:37,098
Not a job, an internship.

1650
02:02:37,367 --> 02:02:39,267
It pays a little, doesn't it?

1651
02:02:39,902 --> 02:02:40,869
A little.

1652
02:02:42,505 --> 02:02:44,496
What about that lady
journalist? Was she a good lay?

1653
02:02:44,741 --> 02:02:46,504
More or less.

1654
02:02:46,709 --> 02:02:48,142
You didn't like it?

1655
02:02:48,411 --> 02:02:50,538
I don't think journalists
know how to screw.

1656
02:02:50,913 --> 02:02:51,709
Yeah, I guess so.

1657
02:02:51,948 --> 02:02:53,813
Cocoa robbed 3 houses
in Barra.

1658
02:02:54,117 --> 02:02:56,108
Better kill him.

1659
02:02:56,319 --> 02:02:58,014
Who shot Roger?

1660
02:02:58,321 --> 02:03:03,315
-It was Beef.
-Kill that fucker.

1661
02:03:03,559 --> 02:03:07,017
We should kill the Chief
and Gringo as well.

1662
02:03:07,330 --> 02:03:09,560
What about Cherry?

1663
02:03:09,732 --> 02:03:13,930
Let's go.
Us two, and 3 others.

1664
02:03:15,738 --> 02:03:17,968
It's a deal.

1665
02:03:18,241 --> 02:03:20,573
Have you heard
of the Red Brigade?

1666
02:03:20,843 --> 02:03:23,243
No, but if they come,
we'll kill them.

1667
02:03:23,646 --> 02:03:26,843
-Who knows how to write?
-Me, sort of.

1668
02:03:27,150 --> 02:03:29,175
Let's make a black list.
We'll kill them all.

1669
02:03:29,452 --> 02:03:31,852
Put fucking Nightowl on there.

1670
02:03:32,054 --> 02:03:33,078
And Croquet.

1671
02:03:33,356 --> 02:03:34,983
Leonard, too,
he owes me money.

1672
02:03:35,258 --> 02:03:39,058
And China-Man,
he thinks he's hot stuff.

1673
02:03:39,362 --> 02:03:41,057
And Claudio.

1674
02:03:41,364 --> 02:03:42,797
Where's Giant?

1675
02:03:43,065 --> 02:03:44,498
Come on, Giant!

1676
02:03:51,240 --> 02:03:52,901
I forgot to say,

1677
02:03:53,209 --> 02:03:55,143
my name isn't Rocket anymore.

1678
02:03:55,411 --> 02:03:59,404
I'm now Wilson Rodrigues,
photographer.

1679
02:04:20,736 --> 02:04:21,964
Manuel Machado,
aka Knockout Ned,

1680
02:04:22,238 --> 02:04:25,833
was hospitalized after being
wounded by Li値 Ze's gang.

1681
02:04:26,075 --> 02:04:29,044
On leaving the hospital,
our reporter interviewed him.

1682
02:04:29,278 --> 02:04:32,247
Many have died.
Mostly innocent people.

1683
02:04:32,448 --> 02:04:34,643
Just knowing me is enough,

1684
02:04:34,851 --> 02:04:37,945
just being my friend.

1685
02:04:38,187 --> 02:04:42,055
If he thinks someone knows me,

1686
02:04:42,291 --> 02:04:43,781
he'll kill them.

1687
02:04:44,093 --> 02:04:46,288
The police don't go in there?

1688
02:04:46,496 --> 02:04:53,732
They go after me, not him.

1689
02:04:54,003 --> 02:04:56,995
I've been in jail 3 times,
while he goes on

1690
02:04:57,240 --> 02:04:59,333
killing undisturbed.

1691
02:04:59,709 --> 02:05:03,008
And they don't arrest him.

1692
02:05:03,312 --> 02:05:05,542
Knockout Ned says
the war will continue.

1693
02:05:05,748 --> 02:05:07,613
Police Chief Guedes
has promised to arrest

1694
02:05:07,817 --> 02:05:10,718
both gangs in the City of God.



9999
