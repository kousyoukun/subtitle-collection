1
00:00:13,086 --> 00:00:17,643
神对该隐说
AND GOD SAID TO CAIN

2
00:00:17,853 --> 00:00:25,668
你可以从蛇形蛇的咬中找到解脱... 中...
You can find liberation from a serpaint's bite... Among the...

3
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:31,241
鲜血、石头和沙子。
Blood, stone and sand.

4
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:44,805
你工作太辛苦了，晚上睡不着觉... 中...
You work so hard that you can't sleep nights... Among the...

5
00:00:46,137 --> 00:00:51,215
石头、血和沙子。
Stones, blood and sand.

6
00:01:02,805 --> 00:01:09,019
也许有一天你会找到自由。
Maybe one day you'll find your freedom.

7
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:14,272
你将越过高山。
And you'll cross the mountains high.

8
00:01:14,772 --> 00:01:20,087
你就能渡过这条又深又宽的河
And you'll cross the deep, wide river

9
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:27,088
诱惑。
Of temptaion.

10
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:32,817
解放,
There's liberation,

11
00:01:33,314 --> 00:01:41,346
从所有的考验和创伤中，
from all the trials and wounds,

12
00:01:41,944 --> 00:01:49,274
从血和悲伤。
From blood and sadness.

13
00:01:49,457 --> 00:01:54,916
还有所有的悲哀。
And all that mourning.

14
00:01:55,653 --> 00:02:02,534
你会看到没人见过的东西。
You'll see what no man has seen.

15
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:08,830
你将面对法官。
You'll face the judge.

16
00:02:15,658 --> 00:02:20,700
石头、血和沙子。
Stones, blood and sand.

17
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:30,050
你将面对法官，你不会害怕。(石头、血和沙)
You'll face the judge and you won't have fear. (Stones, blood and sand)

18
00:02:33,122 --> 00:02:41,498
你将面对法官，你不会害怕。(石头、血和沙)
You'll face the judge and you won't have fear. (Stones, blood and sand)

19
00:03:04,608 --> 00:03:05,746
加里。
Gary.

20
00:03:07,426 --> 00:03:09,479
加里，有一条路可以出去。
Gary, here's one way out of this place.

21
00:03:22,563 --> 00:03:24,364
那不是我想走的路。
That's not the way I wanna go.

22
00:03:31,641 --> 00:03:33,301
- 没有。- 上帝!
- Not yet. - God!

23
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:02,808
加里·汉密尔顿。
Gary Hamilton.

24
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:06,181
加里·汉密尔顿。
Gary Hamilton.

25
00:04:07,477 --> 00:04:08,972
加里·汉密尔顿!
Gary Hamilton!

26
00:04:10,122 --> 00:04:11,296
在这里。
Here.

27
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:03,313
你是加里·汉密尔顿吗? 加里·汉密尔顿中尉?
Are you Gary Hamilton? Liutenant Gary Hamilton?

28
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,787
你，加里·汉密尔顿，被赦免了。
You, Gary Hamilton, have been pardoned.

29
00:05:07,388 --> 00:05:11,030
如果我读到这篇文章，一切可能就都说得通了:
Everything will probably make sense if I read this:

30
00:05:11,425 --> 00:05:14,829
现在，存在一项修正案，考虑大赦政治
Now, the existens of an amendment that condiser amnesty for the political

31
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:17,642
罪犯，考虑到你过去的军事功绩，
offendors, and taking into consideration your past military merits,

32
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:22,625
因此，我代表美国总统，
I therefore, on behalf of the president of the united states,

33
00:05:24,577 --> 00:05:27,980
兹藉上述修订声明:
hereby declare by the virtue of the above amendment,

34
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:31,278
减刑，并立即释放你。
your sentence commuted, and order your immediate release.

35
00:05:36,092 --> 00:05:38,762
因此，你是一个自由的人。
And so therefore, you are a free man.

36
00:05:55,611 --> 00:06:02,385
也许有一天，你会找到你的自由。
Maybe one day, you'll find your freedom.

37
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:09,972
你将越过高山。
And you'll cross the mountains high.

38
00:06:10,118 --> 00:06:17,034
你就能渡过这条又深又宽的河。
And you'll cross the deep, wide river.

39
00:06:17,704 --> 00:06:24,547
的诱惑。
Of temptation.

40
00:08:03,643 --> 00:08:05,102
嘿，约翰尼，我们走!
Hey, Johnny, let's go!

41
00:08:32,104 --> 00:08:33,241
多少钱?
How much?

42
00:08:33,877 --> 00:08:34,910
这是免费的。
It's free.

43
00:08:35,793 --> 00:08:39,237
守卫总是在这里。我会在那些猪身上补偿的，不是囚犯。
The guards are always in here. I'll make it up on those pigs, not the prisoners.

44
00:08:39,273 --> 00:08:41,075
不，男人必须为一切买单。
No, man must pay for everything.

45
00:08:45,672 --> 00:08:47,405
你住院多久了?
How long was you in for?

46
00:08:50,682 --> 00:08:51,715
十年。
Ten years.

47
00:09:06,895 --> 00:09:10,194
好了，我们继续吧。我们还有很长的路要走，快点!
Alright, let's get a move on. We've got a long way to go, come on!

48
00:09:11,035 --> 00:09:12,280
祝你旅途愉快。
Have a good trip.

49
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:54,418
在西点呆了这么长时间后，又回到南方的炎热和尘土中，当然很奇怪。
Sure is strange to come back to the heat and the dust of the south after spending so much time at West Point.

50
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:57,928
- 你是军校学员? - 再过一年，我就当军官了。
- You're a cadete? - Another year, and then I'll be an officer.

51
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,534
在骑兵?
In the cavalry?

52
00:09:59,918 --> 00:10:05,064
是的。我必须决定是继续军旅生涯，还是回去帮我父亲。
Yes. I must decide whether to pursue military career, or return and help my father.

53
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,379
你更喜欢哪一个?
Which do you prefer?

54
00:10:07,884 --> 00:10:12,404
呃，一个妻子，我想，来管理我的生活。如果我还有选择的话，我会结婚，组建家庭。
Eh, a wife I guess, to run my life. If I had any choice at all, I'd get married and raise a family.

55
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:14,769
你为什么不试试呢?
Why didn't you try doing just that?

56
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,798
我父亲，他对我有很多计划。
My father, he has a lot of plans for me.

57
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:19,815
所以我想，我想有更多的选择。
So I suppose, I want have much choice.

58
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,884
- 你是本地人吗? - 是的，我父亲是克拉登矿的所有者。
- Are you from these parts? - Yes, my father is the owner of the Craden mine.

59
00:10:24,306 --> 00:10:25,729
我叫迪克·阿库姆巴。
My name is Dick Acombar.

60
00:10:26,187 --> 00:10:29,245
- 你是说阿库姆巴? - 是的老妈。你认识我父亲吗?
- Did you say Acombar? - Yes mam. You know my father?

61
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:31,333
当然，我经常见到他。
Of course, I see him very often.

62
00:10:31,613 --> 00:10:34,045
我们总是在激流城集市见面。
We always meet at the Torrent city fair.

63
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:39,470
但我不知道他有个这么大的儿子。我一直以为他是个单身汉。
But I never knew he had a son so big. And I always thought he was a bachelor.

64
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,368
一个鳏夫。我五岁时就失去了母亲。
A widower. I lost my mother when I was just five.

65
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:45,279
哦，我很抱歉。
Oh, I'm so sorry.

66
00:11:23,904 --> 00:11:26,124
你想在这里下车吗?
Hey, this where you wanna get off?

67
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:37,080
告诉你父亲加里·汉密尔顿回来了。
You tell your father Gary Hamilton's back in town.

68
00:11:38,797 --> 00:11:40,740
日落时我没看见他。
I don't see him at sundown.

69
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:47,344
你说你叫什么名字?
What did you say your name was?

70
00:11:48,502 --> 00:11:49,927
加里·汉密尔顿。
Gary Hamilton.

71
00:11:50,173 --> 00:11:51,597
你是我父亲的朋友吗?
You a friend of my father's?

72
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:10,864
嘿!
Hey!

73
00:12:16,232 --> 00:12:17,788
他忘记了这一点。
He forgot this.

74
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:23,637
他来见你父亲的时候，你要拿去还给他。
Take it with you and give it back to him when he comes and visits your father.

75
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,422
这些日子真了不得呢?
What'cha lookin' for?

76
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,204
步枪弹药和一匹马。
Rifle ammunition and a horse.

77
00:13:57,893 --> 00:14:00,741
你最好接住。这是我的全部。
You better take it. It's all I've got.

78
00:14:05,024 --> 00:14:06,578
为什么这只是十块钱。
Why this is just ten bucks.

79
00:14:06,973 --> 00:14:09,928
我能给你的就是老飓风，孩子。
Best I can give you for that is old Hurricane, son.

80
00:14:10,071 --> 00:14:13,475
但他是匹好老马。我自己也有点喜欢上他了。
But he's a good old horse. I've become kinda attached to him myself.

81
00:14:17,935 --> 00:14:22,868
总有一天，当我发现他的牙齿也像我的一样长出来时，我不会感到惊讶的。
One of these days I won't be surprised to find his teeth are coming out like min.

82
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:28,124
我想有时候它们确实像它们的主人，就像我爷爷说的。
I guess sometimes they do look like their owner, like my grandpappy said.

83
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,596
现在，这里有一些特别的东西。
Well now, here's something special.

84
00:14:31,223 --> 00:14:34,415
对你来说，这比弹簧还快。是的, 先生。
This here's faster than a spring for you. Yes, sir.

85
00:14:37,174 --> 00:14:38,312
你喜欢吗，孩子?
You like it, son?

86
00:14:40,898 --> 00:14:44,859
我对你一向很好，我想你一定会在这附近找到我的。
Always was good to you, and you were certain to finding me somewhere around here I reckon.

87
00:14:45,036 --> 00:14:49,069
我敢打赌，你从来没有想过这个老人可能是被魔鬼带走的。
And I bet you that you not even once gave it a thought that the old man could have been taken away by the devil.

88
00:14:50,395 --> 00:14:53,065
生活中有些事情是没有希望的。
There are certain things in life that are useless to hope for.

89
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:54,246
我们将会看到。
We'll see.

90
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:30,254
牛的眼睛, 男孩!
Bull's eye, boy!

91
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:33,773
上次龙卷风过后，他就没这么摇晃过了!
He ain't been shook like that since the last tornado!

92
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:38,923
说到这个，我的一个骨头告诉我今晚有一个，是的，先生。
Talking about that, one of my bones tell me we've got one coming tonight, yes siree.

93
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,345
射得很好，但现在我想知道风向。
That's mighty good shooting, but now I wanna know the direction of the wind.

94
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,369
更重要的是。
And what's more.

95
00:15:55,317 --> 00:16:01,438
我们现在没有多少肉了骨头，你和我，所以我们最好及时躲起来，否则它会把我们吹走的。
We ain't got much meat now bones, you and me, so we better hide in time or it'll blow us away.

96
00:16:03,735 --> 00:16:05,502
你觉得我们还有多少时间?
What do you figure, how long we got?

97
00:16:12,677 --> 00:16:14,480
我想不是日落吧，孩子。
Not sundown I imagine, son.

98
00:16:19,498 --> 00:16:22,864
几年过去了，加里，这地方还是那么荒凉。
The years pass by Gary, and this place remains godforsaken.

99
00:16:24,957 --> 00:16:30,413
你试着去建立一些东西，但在你意识到之前，一切都变成了...
You make out trying to build somthing, and before you know it, it all comes to...

100
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:32,123
龙卷风。
Tornado.

101
00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:35,602
来吧, 马
Come on, horse

102
00:16:44,998 --> 00:16:46,028
来吧。
Come on.

103
00:16:46,146 --> 00:16:48,816
唯一能保持原样的是你的老房子。
The only thing that stays it's stand is your old house.

104
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:52,717
是啊，那些西班牙人肯定是想建个堡垒。
Yeah those spaniards must have gotten in their head to build a fortress.

105
00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:55,364
我跟你打赌那不是一个普通的地方。
I bet you that ain't no ordinary place.

106
00:16:57,628 --> 00:17:00,440
- 阿库姆巴住在那里吗? - 确定。
- Is Acombar living there? - Sure.

107
00:17:01,975 --> 00:17:05,000
国王和他的鹅，就是他。你知道吗?
The king and his goose, that's him. And you know?

108
00:17:05,281 --> 00:17:09,968
他不仅得到了你的家，还有你的玛丽。我认为她很坏，仅此而已。
He's not only got your darn home, but your Mary too. I reckon she's bad, that's all.

109
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,170
我知道你的感受。
I know how you must feel.

110
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:17,971
但我必须说，不是每个女孩都是那样的，但有些女孩就是那么容易。
But I must say that every girl ain't like that, but some of them's that easy.

111
00:17:20,904 --> 00:17:22,671
你打算做什么?
What are you planning to do?

112
00:17:26,992 --> 00:17:29,458
等那朵云来了，然后搬到城里。
Wait til' that cloud gets here and then move into town.

113
00:17:29,635 --> 00:17:33,562
有了你和龙卷风，阿库姆巴将度过一个炎热的夜晚。
With you and that tornado Acombar will be having himself a pretty hot night.

114
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:42,706
人受伤。
Wounded.

115
00:17:50,824 --> 00:17:51,928
人受伤。
Wounded.

116
00:17:55,661 --> 00:17:56,763
人受伤。
Wounded.

117
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:01,738
人受伤。
Wounded.

118
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:05,600
你就是这样树敌的。
This is the way you make your enemies.

119
00:18:23,945 --> 00:18:25,747
这样你就能拥有所有的力量。
This way you can have all the power.

120
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:34,969
这正是我希望我儿子迪克能做到的。
That's exactly what I want for my son Dick.

121
00:18:38,072 --> 00:18:40,089
嘿, 吉姆! 我来了。
Hey, Jim! I'm coming.

122
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:50,107
露丝，看看刚刚发生了什么
Rosy, look what just happened

123
00:18:50,492 --> 00:18:53,754
这家伙害了相思病，连床都带上了。
This one is so lovesick, he carries his bed along with him.

124
00:18:55,642 --> 00:18:57,656
快点，乔，我们还需要两个人。
Hurry up, Joe, we need two more.

125
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,909
你在期待今晚的狂欢吗?
Are you expecting an orgy tonight?

126
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:03,258
快点，乔，我们没有时间浪费了。
Come on, Joe, we haven't got time to be waisting.

127
00:19:08,026 --> 00:19:10,423
保护瓶子是我的主意。
It's my idea to protect the bottles.

128
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,837
我们覆盖它们。我们盖住它们，这样当龙卷风来的时候...
We cover them. We cover them so when the tornado comes...

129
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,077
轿车...
The saloon...

130
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:19,813
酒吧可能会被吹走，但酒是安全的。
The saloon may blow away, but the booze'll be safe.

131
00:19:20,936 --> 00:19:22,809
你脑子里有脑子。
You got a brain in your head.

132
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,749
你也知道。
You know it too.

133
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:42,564
出去。
Get out.

134
00:19:43,028 --> 00:19:44,695
很高兴见到你。和你的兄弟吗?
Good to see you. And your brothers?

135
00:19:44,732 --> 00:19:47,994
他们和你父亲在一起，在农场等我们。我们走吧。
They're with your father and they're waiting for us out at the ranch. Let's go.

136
00:19:48,315 --> 00:19:49,419
Bookport那边。
Bookport's over there.

137
00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:51,123
- 你好, 迪克。- 嗨。和我的行李吗?
- Howdy, Dick. - Hi. And my bags?

138
00:19:51,342 --> 00:19:53,181
别管他们，他会抓到他们的。来吧。
Leave them, he'll get them. Come on.

139
00:19:54,683 --> 00:19:56,556
再见，希望再见到您。
Well good bye, hope to see you again.

140
00:19:56,909 --> 00:20:00,516
如果你和你父亲一起来交易会，请顺便过来给我们打个电话。
If you come to the fair with your father, please stop by and give us a call.

141
00:20:01,222 --> 00:20:03,583
- 再见，Acombar先生。- 女士。
- Good bye, Mr. Acombar. - Ma'am.

142
00:20:08,564 --> 00:20:10,225
新征服, 是吗?
New conquest, eh?

143
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,271
如果情况严重，告诉我我和我的兄弟们会给你最棒的绑架案。
If it's serious, you let me know and me and my brothers will give you the best kidnapping job you've seen.

144
00:20:48,296 --> 00:20:50,278
我们会帮他铺平道路。
And we'll help him by paving the way.

145
00:20:55,535 --> 00:20:58,594
这将是一个相当迅速的政治生涯。
This will be a rather rapid political career.

146
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:03,666
他将被选为参议员。
He will be elected senator.

147
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:10,657
有了我的钱和权力，他应该很容易成为...
And with my money and power, it should be easy for him to become...

148
00:21:14,878 --> 00:21:16,991
州长。
Governor of the state.

149
00:21:18,636 --> 00:21:19,810
然后...
And then...

150
00:21:23,714 --> 00:21:25,589
美国总统。
President of the United States.

151
00:21:28,028 --> 00:21:29,096
迪克!
Dick!

152
00:21:30,534 --> 00:21:31,672
迪克。
Dick.

153
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,343
你看起来不错，儿子。回家高兴吗?
You look good, son. Glad to be home?

154
00:21:37,598 --> 00:21:38,736
肯定是。
Sure am.

155
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,107
好久不见了。
It's been a long time.

156
00:21:42,955 --> 00:21:47,511
- 见到你真让我高兴，儿子。- 见到你真让我高兴，爸爸。
- It sure makes me feel good to see you, son. - It sure makes me feel good to see you, dad.

157
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:49,243
注意!
Attention!

158
00:21:49,913 --> 00:21:52,452
圣玛丽亚的军队听从您的命令，先生。
The army of Santa Maria is at your orders, sir.

159
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,494
就像三个火枪手一样。
Just like the three musketeers.

160
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,384
也许有一天我能成为你的达达尼昂。
And maybe some day I can be your Dartagnan.

161
00:22:02,646 --> 00:22:06,917
- 玛丽在哪里? - 在里面。她会很高兴你回家的。到来。
- Where's Mary? - Inside. She'll be real happy you're home. Come along.

162
00:22:09,013 --> 00:22:10,188
Juanito!
Juanito!

163
00:22:12,703 --> 00:22:15,299
欢迎回家, 奇科。我很高兴见到你。
Welcome home, chico. I'm so happy to see you.

164
00:22:18,721 --> 00:22:21,674
玛丽为你准备了家里最好的房间。
Mary had the best room in the house prepared for you.

165
00:22:25,122 --> 00:22:27,446
- 欢迎回来，迪克 - 谢谢你，弗兰克。
- Welcome back, Dick. - Thank you, Frank.

166
00:22:27,696 --> 00:22:29,226
上来喝一杯吧。
Come on up and have a drink.

167
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:15,838
迪克! 欢迎回家。
Dick! Welcome home.

168
00:23:16,824 --> 00:23:19,256
你穿制服真帅。
You look divine in your uniform.

169
00:23:19,921 --> 00:23:21,235
也许是这样。
That may be so.

170
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:25,376
但我想他一定很想脱下来洗个热水澡。
But I imagine he's dying to get it off and take a hot bath.

171
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:27,013
- 对吗? - 你说对了，爸爸。
- Isn't that right? - You said it, dad.

172
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:28,789
空气是静止的。
The air's to still.

173
00:23:29,244 --> 00:23:30,737
龙卷风天气。
Tornado weather.

174
00:23:30,947 --> 00:23:33,274
不幸的是，情况会变得更糟。
It'll get worse, unfortunately.

175
00:23:33,523 --> 00:23:36,264
龙卷风来之前，都是这样。
That's the way it always is, before a tornado.

176
00:23:36,864 --> 00:23:41,204
还记得两年前的那个吗? 老人们说今晚会更糟。
Remember the one two yeras ago? Well, the old folks say that tonight will be even worse.

177
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:45,456
你还在等什么? 你是来喝一杯的，对吧?
What are you waiting for? You came up for a drink, didn't you?

178
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,716
- 继续，冲锋。- 我们会的，先生
- Go on, charge. - We will, sir.

179
00:23:48,483 --> 00:23:51,888
- 你有什么，儿子? - 现在没有，谢谢爸爸。我洗澡后。
- What do you have, son? - Nothing just now, thanks dad. After my bath.

180
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,596
阿库姆巴少校，我跟你一起上去。
Major Acombar, I'll go up with you.

181
00:24:02,712 --> 00:24:03,779
哦, 爸爸。
Oh, dad.

182
00:24:04,104 --> 00:24:08,410
我差点忘了。在十字路口下车的陌生人
I almost forgot. A stranger that got off at the crossing...

183
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:11,854
他说日落的时候会来这里。
Said he'd be paying a visit here at sundown.

184
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,477
- 我想他是你的朋友 - 继续
- I think he's a friend of yours - Go on.

185
00:24:17,012 --> 00:24:18,994
- 他叫... - 给您，先生。
- His name is... - Here you are, sir.

186
00:24:21,952 --> 00:24:23,305
哦，是的，加里·汉密尔顿。
Oh yes, Gary Hamilton.

187
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:47,101
- 那是什么? - 猛禽。
- What is that? - Bird of prey.

188
00:24:48,707 --> 00:24:50,261
龙卷风来了。
Por causa do tornado.

189
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:54,761
动物察觉到麻烦，就会避开它。
Animals sense trouble, and avoid it.

190
00:24:58,972 --> 00:25:02,410
他把这个留在了舞台上。你能把它还给他吗?
He left this on the stage. Will you give it back to him?

191
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:07,454
- 你来吗? - 当然, 迪克。是的。
- Are you coming? - Certainly, Dick. Yes.

192
00:25:09,618 --> 00:25:10,758
我们走吧。
Let's go.

193
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,363
这是他的好吧，我记得很清楚。
It's his alright, I remember it well.

194
00:25:21,445 --> 00:25:24,400
我们把它放在马车上，作为对他不利的证据。
We put it on the stagecoach, as evidence against him.

195
00:25:24,647 --> 00:25:25,856
闭嘴!
Shut up!

196
00:25:28,753 --> 00:25:30,864
我不希望家里有人提起这件事。
I don't want this story mentioned in the house.

197
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:35,711
如果他真要来，我们就等他。
If he really is coming, we'll wait for him.

198
00:25:36,547 --> 00:25:39,216
我们要确保他不能活着进来。
And we'll make sure he doesn't get in here alive.

199
00:25:40,131 --> 00:25:42,239
这也符合你的利益。
It's in your interest as well.

200
00:25:42,703 --> 00:25:45,409
记住:我的儿子绝对不能知道这件事。
And remember: My son mustn't know anything about this.

201
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,185
他不会知道的，你放心吧，先生。
And he won't know, you can count on that, sir.

202
00:25:52,447 --> 00:25:54,985
把人叫来，到城外等我。
Get the men together and meet me outside of town.

203
00:26:00,415 --> 00:26:02,950
他被判终身监禁。你觉得他逃跑了吗?
He is in for life. Do you think he escaped?

204
00:26:03,091 --> 00:26:05,274
根本不可能知道。
There won't be any way of knowing.

205
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,388
- 在他死后。- 万一发生什么事呢?
- After he's dead. - And if anything should happen?

206
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:12,163
我要他死。
I want him dead.

207
00:26:13,878 --> 00:26:15,468
米格尔，你听到了吗?
Did you hear that, Miguel?

208
00:26:16,522 --> 00:26:19,892
阻止他。一劳永逸。
Stop him. Once and for all.

209
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:36,795
出去。
Get out.

210
00:27:14,451 --> 00:27:16,703
鬼回来了。和他会...
A ghost returning. And he'll have...

211
00:27:18,175 --> 00:27:20,568
他心里只有一个愿望。
He'll have only one desire in his heart.

212
00:27:21,338 --> 00:27:24,043
只有一个干渴。报复。
Only one thirst. Revenge.

213
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:26,869
你担心吗?
Are you worried?

214
00:27:27,219 --> 00:27:31,288
没有，但你儿子肯定怀疑我。
No, but your son must have suspected that I was.

215
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:34,386
他问我是否认识加里·汉密尔顿。
He asked me if I knew Gary Hamilton.

216
00:27:35,639 --> 00:27:37,334
你怎么说?
And what did you say?

217
00:27:38,632 --> 00:27:42,972
我告诉他我不认识他。我从没听过这个名字。
I told him that I didn't know him. That I'd never heard the name before.

218
00:27:45,379 --> 00:27:47,847
但是，也许这就是事实。
But then, maybe that's the truth.

219
00:27:48,824 --> 00:27:51,077
我真的没有时间。
I really didn't get the time.

220
00:27:51,644 --> 00:27:53,517
去了解他
To get to know him.

221
00:27:55,818 --> 00:27:58,214
我只有时间
I only had the time

222
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,130
背叛他。
to betray him.

223
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:04,121
别说了，你又不认识他。
Let's keep it that way, you didn't know him.

224
00:28:04,862 --> 00:28:05,931
明白了吗?
Get it?

225
00:28:06,498 --> 00:28:08,087
一定不能让迪克知道。
Dick must never know.

226
00:28:08,761 --> 00:28:12,829
总之，汉米尔顿不可能活着进来。
Anyway, Hamilton will never get in here alive.

227
00:29:36,714 --> 00:29:39,217
不管谁来，都会受到热烈欢迎。
Whoever's coming's gonna get a rowdy welcome.

228
00:29:40,365 --> 00:29:41,990
你说呢，法官?
What do you say, judge?

229
00:29:54,946 --> 00:29:56,048
安妮!
Annie!

230
00:29:56,858 --> 00:29:58,353
嗨, 叔叔Johnathan。
Hi, uncle Johnathan.

231
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:04,745
今晚真的要刮风了吗?
Is it true the wind's coming tonight?

232
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:09,521
你拿命打赌。你最好待在室内。不许往窗外偷看。
You bet your life. And you better stay indoors. No peeking out the windows.

233
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:12,162
稍后会有很多危险的爆炸。
There's gonna be lots of dangerous later blowing.

234
00:30:13,767 --> 00:30:15,261
它们在今晚的微风中飘荡。
They're blowing in the breeze tonight.

235
00:30:23,925 --> 00:30:25,136
安妮, 没有。
Annie, no.

236
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:27,081
不，小家伙，不不不，等等。
Oh no, little one, no no no, wait.

237
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:31,055
如果你把这些拿走，乔纳森叔叔什么也看不见。
Uncle Johnathan can't se a damned thing if you take these away.

238
00:30:34,189 --> 00:30:36,516
- 时间到了。风快来了 - 快走。
- The hour's now. The wind's almost here - Go on.

239
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,745
确保他们尽快上床睡觉。
And you make sure they go to bed soon.

240
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:44,584
你最好也待在屋里。如果阿库姆巴试图把风吓跑，我不会感到惊讶。
You better stay inside too. I wouldn't be surprised if Acombar tries to scare that wind away.

241
00:32:32,342 --> 00:32:33,730
他到底去哪儿了?
Where the hell did he go?

242
00:32:55,097 --> 00:32:57,172
有什么事吗? 你疯了吗?
What's the matter? You crazy or something?

243
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,607
好吧，跟我来，跟紧点。
Alright, follow me, and keep close.

244
00:33:14,266 --> 00:33:18,300
在我们自相残杀之前赶紧回城里吧。我们。
Let's get back to town before we end up shooting amongst ourselves. Vamos.

245
00:33:36,534 --> 00:33:37,637
吉姆。
Jim.

246
00:33:41,681 --> 00:33:44,493
让我们分成小组。你和你的人去牧场前面。
Let's split up into groups. You go with your men to the front of the ranch.

247
00:33:44,953 --> 00:33:47,136
如果我们不先在这里找到他，他肯定会去那里。
If we don't find him here first, then he will go there for sure.

248
00:33:47,214 --> 00:33:48,459
对, 我们走吧。
Right, let's go.

249
00:33:58,731 --> 00:34:02,205
- Acombar真的在悬赏吗? - 对，大的。
- Is it true Acombar is offering a reward? - Si, a big one.

250
00:34:02,766 --> 00:34:04,603
得先抓住他。
Gotta catch him first.

251
00:34:15,188 --> 00:34:18,487
- 你在找谁? - 少管闲事，老头。
- Who are you looking for? - Mind your own business, old man.

252
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,357
回你的房子去。
Go back into your house.

253
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,416
留在原地。
Stay put too.

254
00:35:03,789 --> 00:35:05,105
该死的风。
Damn wind.

255
00:35:14,925 --> 00:35:16,028
我们。
Vamos.

256
00:35:18,545 --> 00:35:22,053
哪儿也找不到他。我们在原地打转。
He is nowhere to be found. We're running around in circles.

257
00:35:22,509 --> 00:35:26,020
如果我们继续这样下去，我们肯定会失去那1万美元的奖金。
If we keep this up, we'll lose that 10,000 dollar award for sure.

258
00:39:44,038 --> 00:39:45,354
为什么今晚?
Why tonight?

259
00:39:46,404 --> 00:39:48,313
他今晚为什么要按铃?
What's he ringing the bell tonight for?

260
00:39:48,492 --> 00:39:53,641
不可能是部长。我看见他把门铃系在前门。
Can't be the minister. I saw him tie up that bell by the front door.

261
00:39:54,303 --> 00:39:56,449
一定是别人把它解开的。
Somebody else must have untied it.

262
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,090
它会给我们带来坏运气。
It'll bring us bad luck.

263
00:41:08,686 --> 00:41:09,790
吉姆。
Jim.

264
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,433
骗子, 骗子, 骗子!
Liar, liar, liar!

265
00:42:00,907 --> 00:42:02,640
我准备好喝一杯了。
I'm ready for that drink now.

266
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,542
你长得真像，我都快认不出你了。
Well you do look like that, I hardly recognized you.

267
00:42:09,398 --> 00:42:12,423
- 今晚怎么了? - 一定是风。
- What's going on tonight? - Must be the wind.

268
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:15,375
- 贝尔被解开了。- 那枪声呢?
- Bell got untied. - What about the gunfire?

269
00:42:16,704 --> 00:42:20,559
可能只是喝醉了，想把龙卷风吓跑。
Probably just some drunk, trying to scare the tornado away.

270
00:42:22,514 --> 00:42:24,696
让我们为你的归来干杯。
Let's drink to your return.

271
00:42:26,933 --> 00:42:28,878
你想尝尝这个吗?
And would you like to try some of this?

272
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,120
不。
No.

273
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:22,268
吉姆!
Jim!

274
00:44:25,328 --> 00:44:26,468
吉姆!
Jim!

275
00:44:31,104 --> 00:44:32,457
没有, 吉姆。
No, Jim.

276
00:44:36,741 --> 00:44:37,774
吉姆!
Jim!

277
00:45:50,743 --> 00:45:52,548
谁按的铃?
Who rang the bell?

278
00:45:56,729 --> 00:45:59,122
一定是汉密尔顿。那不是鬼。
It must have been Hamilton. It was not a ghost.

279
00:46:00,345 --> 00:46:01,839
我将警告Acombar。
I'll warn Acombar.

280
00:46:05,982 --> 00:46:07,605
我就呆在这里。
I'll stick around here.

281
00:46:33,155 --> 00:46:34,816
我杀了他，父亲。
I killed him, father.

282
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,554
父亲，我为什么叫你父亲?
Father, what am I doing calling you father?

283
00:46:40,981 --> 00:46:43,652
我为什么要跟一个相信
And what am I doing talking to a man that believes in the

284
00:46:44,532 --> 00:46:46,299
宽容的上帝吗?
forgiving God?

285
00:46:47,836 --> 00:46:53,365
我想让你知道加里·汉密尔顿已经被判终身监禁了。
I want you to know that Gary Hamilton has got a life sentence engraved in his skin.

286
00:46:55,803 --> 00:46:59,514
一天又一天，他们说服我，我的位置在里面。
Day after day they convinced me that my place was inside.

287
00:47:00,883 --> 00:47:02,994
外面的生活对我来说已经没有意义了。
Life outside has no more meaning for me.

288
00:47:04,223 --> 00:47:05,847
现在只有复仇了。
Now it's only revenge.

289
00:47:09,895 --> 00:47:12,850
这样就能解决其中一个了。等我把剩下的都弄好了...
That takes care of one of them. Now when I'm finished with the rest of them...

290
00:47:13,514 --> 00:47:14,758
圣玛丽
Santa Marias,

291
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:20,215
Acombar自己。
Acombar himself.

292
00:47:23,114 --> 00:47:26,033
我已经花了十年的时间来考虑我的复仇计划。
I've had ten long years to think out my revenge.

293
00:47:27,986 --> 00:47:31,495
如果无辜的人被判入狱，那我就有权杀人。
If innocents is repaid with prison, then I've earned the right to kill.

294
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:38,943
你听见了吗，父亲?
Do you hear me, father?

295
00:47:41,032 --> 00:47:43,286
即使上帝会因此惩罚我。
Even if God chooses to punish me for it.

296
00:47:51,158 --> 00:47:54,871
是的，他不知怎么进来了，然后，
Yes, he got in somehow, and then,

297
00:47:55,959 --> 00:47:57,382
他杀害了吉姆。
he killed Jim.

298
00:47:57,699 --> 00:48:00,237
别告诉我你被一个人骗了。
Don't tell me you allowed yourself to be tricked by one man.

299
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:04,201
你有30多个人。你一定要找到他。
You've got more than 30 men. You've got to find him.

300
00:48:06,569 --> 00:48:08,337
谁在敲教堂的钟?
Who was ringing the church bell?

301
00:48:09,285 --> 00:48:10,600
- 也许他。- 爸爸。
- Maybe him. - Dad.

302
00:48:11,023 --> 00:48:13,171
你不太忙吗? 晚饭准备好了。
You're not too busy? Dinner's ready.

303
00:48:13,911 --> 00:48:15,300
我马上就来。
I'll be right there.

304
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,371
传播出去。
Spread out.

305
00:50:33,008 --> 00:50:35,749
爸爸，听起来今晚有很多酒鬼在外面。
Dad, it sound like there are many drunks out tonight.

306
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,095
你还想再来点吗?
Would you like some more?

307
00:51:34,104 --> 00:51:35,693
在这里, 乔。快。
Down here, Joe. Quick.

308
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,439
加里!
Gary!

309
00:52:33,179 --> 00:52:34,390
妈的，我就知道。
Son of a gun, I knew it.

310
00:52:37,148 --> 00:52:40,514
我知道那是你，知道你会来这里。
I knew darn well it was you, and that you'd come here.

311
00:52:40,763 --> 00:52:42,875
所以我才替你把架子从井里拿下来。
That's why I took the rack off the well for you.

312
00:52:43,234 --> 00:52:47,682
你骑着马消失的时候我以为你会躲到地下
You see when you disappeared on that horse I figured you'd go under ground to the

313
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,769
古老的印度墓园。
old indian cemetary.

314
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:57,359
当我还是个孩子的时候，我们在那待过很长时间。
We spent a lot of time down there when I was a kid.

315
00:52:58,194 --> 00:53:01,599
你知道自从你入狱后一切都变了。
You know things ain't never been the same since you got put away.

316
00:53:03,203 --> 00:53:04,757
关于唯一一个...
About the only person that...

317
00:53:08,075 --> 00:53:11,374
让她昂首阔步的是罗斯。其余的人都害怕阿库姆巴。
That has kept her head high has been Rosy. The rest are scared of Acombar.

318
00:53:12,563 --> 00:53:16,418
她为此付出了沉重的代价。开枪打死了她的丈夫约翰尼。
She's had to pay dearly. The shot and killed Johnny, her husband.

319
00:53:16,844 --> 00:53:19,345
他们称之为“意外”。
And the called it "an accident".

320
00:53:21,817 --> 00:53:23,726
- 法官呢? - 法官?
- And the judge? - The judge?

321
00:53:25,541 --> 00:53:28,280
他们能买到的第一批。
One of the first they could buy.

322
00:53:28,881 --> 00:53:30,719
你的腿怎么了?
What happened to your leg?

323
00:53:32,116 --> 00:53:34,787
这是一个旧金山的圣马尔韆的礼物。
That was a present from Francisco Santa Mar韆.

324
00:53:36,084 --> 00:53:38,098
- 事故? - 还有什么?
- An accident? - What else?

325
00:53:39,247 --> 00:53:41,465
如果我想活下去，那只是个意外。
If I wanted to stay alive, it was an accident.

326
00:53:42,762 --> 00:53:44,115
那你呢?
And what aboput you?

327
00:53:48,609 --> 00:53:51,110
长时间休息。大量的蛇。
A long rest. Lots of snakes.

328
00:53:54,488 --> 00:53:57,335
快到酒吧间去。你会更安全。
Get on over to the saloon. You'll be a lot safer.

329
00:54:11,222 --> 00:54:12,253
神的母亲!
Mother of God!

330
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:22,378
佩德罗! 佩德罗!
Pedro! Pedro!

331
00:54:24,233 --> 00:54:25,728
把你的手给我。
Give me your hand.

332
00:54:27,191 --> 00:54:28,650
我们把他带到酒吧去。
Let's bring him into the saloon.

333
00:54:29,453 --> 00:54:30,521
小心。
Careful.

334
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:03,608
胡安! 爱马仕!
Juan! Hermes!

335
00:55:18,092 --> 00:55:19,550
把他放在地板上。
Put him down on the floor.

336
00:55:36,428 --> 00:55:38,264
他们说你是医生。好吗?
They say you are a doctor. Well?

337
00:55:39,732 --> 00:55:41,391
也许你能做点什么。
Maybe you can do something.

338
00:55:42,097 --> 00:55:43,902
我不希望他死。
I would not like him to die.

339
00:55:44,777 --> 00:55:46,794
听。它不是汉密尔顿。
Listen. It wasn't Hamilton.

340
00:55:47,491 --> 00:55:48,915
它是一个怪物。
It was a monster.

341
00:55:51,633 --> 00:55:52,735
从地狱!
From hell!

342
00:55:55,842 --> 00:55:56,910
佩德罗!
Pedro!

343
00:55:57,476 --> 00:55:58,505
佩德罗!
Pedro!

344
00:55:59,388 --> 00:56:00,635
你不能死。
You mustn't die.

345
00:56:01,511 --> 00:56:02,578
不。
No.

346
00:56:03,355 --> 00:56:05,373
现在我来对付汉密尔顿。
And now I will take care of Hamilton.

347
00:56:08,227 --> 00:56:10,338
给我的人来点威士忌! 需要它!
Give me some whiskey for my men! The need it!

348
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:12,676
他们认为有一个怪物。
They think there is a monster.

349
00:56:13,378 --> 00:56:15,001
我说没有。
I say there is not.

350
00:56:16,961 --> 00:56:18,726
这是一个悲惨的人。
It is one miserable man.

351
00:56:19,569 --> 00:56:22,274
我希望和他面对面地见面。去找他!
I wish to meet him face to face. Go find him!

352
00:56:24,751 --> 00:56:26,484
把它发给那些人。
Pass thit out to the men.

353
00:56:32,303 --> 00:56:35,044
然后把命令传给其他人让他们在农场前等我。
And pass the order to the rest of them to meet me in front of the ranch.

354
00:56:44,341 --> 00:56:46,215
你能给我留一个吗?
Would you leave one for me!

355
00:56:57,561 --> 00:56:58,804
你想要钱?
You wanna be paid?

356
00:56:59,195 --> 00:57:03,918
别告诉我你担心阿库姆巴没有足够的钱来买几瓶臭气熏天的酒。
Don't tell me you're afraid that Acombar haven't got enough money to pay for a few stinking bottles.

357
00:57:05,111 --> 00:57:07,650
你可以把这个放下。这是覆盆子糖浆。
You can leave this one behind. It's raspberry syrup.

358
00:57:08,278 --> 00:57:11,054
嗯好吧... 树莓糖浆不是我们...
Yeah okay... Raspberry syrup isn't what we...

359
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:20,694
我希望真的是加里。这样他至少少了一个人。
I hope it's really Gary. This way at least he'll have to fight with one less.

360
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:22,947
即使他们为此杀了我。
Even if they shoot me for it.

361
00:57:47,627 --> 00:57:48,695
抓住。

00:57:52,429 --> 00:57:53,459
在这里。

363

米盖尔!

364
00:58:13,094 --> 00:58:14,162
米盖尔!

爸爸。

367
00:59:41,674 --> 00:59:43,548
加里·汉密尔顿想从你这里得到什么?
What does Gary Hamilton want from you?

368
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:34,130
他在吗?

01:01:32,104 --> 01:01:33,349
米盖尔!

米格尔。
Miguel.

374
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:27,589
要么绑起来，要么把它撞倒! 别再响铃了!
Tie it up or knock it down! Stop that bell ringing!

375
01:02:47,845 --> 01:02:48,949
传教士,
Preacher,

376
01:02:50,211 --> 01:02:51,801
谁按的铃?
who rang the bell?

377
01:03:10,565 --> 01:03:12,225
米格尔。米盖尔!
Miguel. Miguel!

378
01:03:29,873 --> 01:03:30,941

我问他是谁!

01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,500
我要一个答案!
I want an answer!

382
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:59,494
米格尔。米盖尔, 请。
Miguel. Please, Miguel.

383
01:05:23,015 --> 01:05:24,082
我们走吧!
Let's go!

384
01:06:20,631 --> 01:06:22,182
把那个铃铛弄掉!
Get rid of that bell!

385
01:06:35,488 --> 01:06:37,183
- 你在吗，奇科? - 是的!
- You out there, Chico? - Si!

386
01:06:44,603 --> 01:06:46,929
好吧，把它系紧，然后下来!
Well fasten it and then come on down!

387
01:08:12,591 --> 01:08:13,944
让开!
Out of the way!

388
01:08:16,141 --> 01:08:17,349
我们走吧!
Let's go!

389
01:08:17,879 --> 01:08:19,539
我们回牧场去吧。
Let's get back to the ranch.

390
01:08:26,264 --> 01:08:27,295
好吧, 来吧!
Well, come on!

391
01:10:58,928 --> 01:11:00,804
我在找你，汉密尔顿。
I was looking for you, Hamilton.

392
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:02,997
为什么会发生大规模屠杀?
Why this mass killing?

393
01:11:03,556 --> 01:11:07,103
你为什么这么恨我父亲? 你想杀了他，对吧?
Why do you hate my father so much? You want to kill him, don't you?

394
01:11:09,508 --> 01:11:10,611
是的。
Yes.

395
01:11:18,831 --> 01:11:21,084
我没想攻击你，我没有武器。
I don't intend to attack you, I'm unarmed.

396
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,996
我来是因为我想知道真相
I came 'cause I wanna know the truth.

397
01:11:39,915 --> 01:11:41,716
我必须知道真相!
I have to know the thruth!

398
01:11:45,169 --> 01:11:46,236
加里!
Gary!

399
01:11:49,066 --> 01:11:50,275
最后。
At last.

400
01:11:56,892 --> 01:12:01,235
我不能像你说的那样待在这里。我想帮你。这武器已经很古老了。
I couldn't just stay here like you said. I wanna help you. Now this weapon is mighty old.

401
01:12:01,381 --> 01:12:03,361
但即使是这样，它仍然足够好。
But even if it is, it still works good enough.

402
01:12:07,121 --> 01:12:08,855
只是阿库姆巴的儿子。
It's only Acombar's son.

403
01:12:20,691 --> 01:12:22,493
他想知道关于他父亲的真相。
He wants to know the thruth about his father.

404
01:12:26,849 --> 01:12:28,723
你觉得你能接受吗?
You think you can take it?

405
01:12:29,702 --> 01:12:31,506
我会告诉你整个事情的经过。
I'll tell you the whole story.

406
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:38,706
你想听吗?
You wanna hear it?

407
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:43,119
是的，我一定要听。
Yes, I must hear it.

408
01:12:44,663 --> 01:12:45,766
迪克!
Dick!

409
01:12:57,151 --> 01:12:58,253
迪克!
Dick!

410
01:13:01,049 --> 01:13:02,507
你看到我儿子了吗?
Have you seen my son?

411
01:13:07,207 --> 01:13:09,497
- 迪克在哪里? - 他没和你在一起吗?
- Where is Dick? - Isn't he with you?

412
01:13:10,547 --> 01:13:12,600
他出去追你了。他跟着你出去了?
He went out after you. He followed you out?

413
01:13:13,123 --> 01:13:14,367
你这个笨蛋!
You idiot!

414
01:13:15,941 --> 01:13:18,821
你应该阻止他的! 你应该知道的!
You should have stopped him! You know better than that!

415
01:13:19,976 --> 01:13:21,707
你应该阻止他的!
You should have stopped him!

416
01:13:23,559 --> 01:13:25,991
如果他有个三长两短，你会付出代价的!
You'll pay for it if somthing happens to him!

417
01:13:33,266 --> 01:13:35,321
去给自己找把枪。扔掉它!
Go find yourself a gun. Get rid of that!

418
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:49,571
迈克!
Mike!

419
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:51,416
迈克!
Mike!

420
01:13:55,116 --> 01:13:56,502
迈克! 迈克!
Mike! Mike!

421
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:01,297
迪克进城去了。我要你带几个人去把他带回来。
Dick went into town. I want you to take some men and go bring him back.

422
01:14:01,377 --> 01:14:04,118
你在那里! 把马牵到后面的马厩里去，快点!
You there! Get those horses in the back barn, hurry up now!

423
01:14:06,457 --> 01:14:09,270
如果风车倒下了怎么办? 我们走吧, 那就动起来吧。
What if that windmill comes down. Let's go, move.

424
01:14:24,896 --> 01:14:26,213
他就在这里。
There he is.

425
01:14:36,795 --> 01:14:39,677
你疯了吗，一个人出去? 你怎么了?
Are you out of your head going out alone? What got into you?

426
01:14:41,109 --> 01:14:42,391
我们回家吧。
Let's go home.

427
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:47,606
迈克，把这四个人留在这里。把剩下的送回牧场。
Mike, leave these four men here. Get the rest back to the ranch.

428
01:14:54,367 --> 01:14:55,683
他们已经走了。
They've gone.

429
01:14:56,174 --> 01:14:58,321
那孩子不可能告诉他你在哪里。
The kid couldn't have told him where you were.

430
01:14:58,749 --> 01:15:00,209
但听着, 加里...
But listen, Gary...

431
01:15:01,045 --> 01:15:02,884
你最好不要在这里待太久。
It's better if you don't stay here for long.

432
01:15:11,727 --> 01:15:14,645
- 你为什么进城? - 我想见加里·汉密尔顿。
- Whay'd you go into town? - I wanted to meet up with Gary Hamilton.

433
01:15:22,615 --> 01:15:23,931
得到它!
Get it going!

434
01:15:27,348 --> 01:15:29,187
街上一个人也没有了。
There's noone left on the street.

435
01:15:32,497 --> 01:15:35,001
他们一定在农场等你。听...
They must be waiting for you at the ranch. Listen...

436
01:15:36,254 --> 01:15:38,508
加里·... 我不了解你。
Gary... I don't understand you.

437
01:15:39,107 --> 01:15:41,777
如果你想知道真相我觉得你已经疯了。
And if you wanna know the truth I think you've gone right out of your mind.

438
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:43,555
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

439
01:15:43,874 --> 01:15:46,900
我可不愿意像你那样，一分钟也不肯给那个小流氓解释。
I wouldn't have waisted a minute explaining to that young scoundrel like you did.

440
01:15:47,702 --> 01:15:50,336
你不知道他比他父亲强多少，对吧?
You don't know that he's any better than his father, do you?

441
01:15:50,452 --> 01:15:52,324
你有孩子。你知道我们的。
You have children. You know that our.

442
01:15:54,452 --> 01:15:56,525
我们的错误不应该落在他们身上。
Our faults shouldn't fall on them.

443
01:16:00,677 --> 01:16:01,746
加里。
Gary.

444
01:16:07,011 --> 01:16:09,027
玛丽和他一起在房子里。
Mary is there with him in the house.

445
01:16:10,247 --> 01:16:11,421
我知道。
I know.

446
01:16:43,299 --> 01:16:45,352
- 把它。- 不, 谢谢。
- Take it. - No thanks.

447
01:16:45,596 --> 01:16:47,742
我有这个。这是最后的决战。
I have this. This here's a showdown.

448
01:16:48,448 --> 01:16:49,552
祝你好运。
Good luck.

449
01:17:01,981 --> 01:17:03,511
嘿, 那边!
Hey, over there!

450
01:17:04,556 --> 01:17:06,253
我发誓我看到了什么。
I could've sworn I saw something.

451
01:17:08,453 --> 01:17:10,044
- 他在哪里? - 在这里。
- Where is he? - Here.

452
01:17:34,931 --> 01:17:36,103
进来吧。
Come on in.

453
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:47,794
来吧!
Come on!

454
01:17:56,882 --> 01:17:58,305
环顾四周。
Look around.

455
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:02,821
你自己好好看看。
Take a good look for yourself.

456
01:18:08,678 --> 01:18:09,994
看到了吗?
See this?

457
01:18:11,741 --> 01:18:13,235
所有这一切吗?
All of this?

458
01:18:20,054 --> 01:18:22,236
这就是加里·汉密尔顿。
This is what Gary Hamilton was.

459
01:18:26,735 --> 01:18:27,803
但是...
But...

460
01:18:29,031 --> 01:18:30,311
这是你的。
It's your's.

461
01:18:39,223 --> 01:18:40,683
这是你的儿子。
It's your's, son.

462
01:18:42,564 --> 01:18:44,262
还是你更愿意...
Or would you prefer to...

463
01:18:46,705 --> 01:18:49,897
住在粪堆里... 像我一样,
live in a dung heap... Like I did,

464
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:52,199
当我还是个孩子的时候?
when I was a boy?

465
01:18:55,992 --> 01:18:57,238
好吗?
Well?

466
01:19:00,586 --> 01:19:01,939
我将告诉你。
I'll tell you.

467
01:19:02,918 --> 01:19:04,377
你不会喜欢的，孩子。
You wouldn't like it, boy.

468
01:19:04,971 --> 01:19:07,639
别告诉我你不喜欢我给你的生活。
And don't tell me you don't like the life I've offered you so far.

469
01:19:09,599 --> 01:19:11,259
我和你想的不一样。
I don't think like you.

470
01:19:15,616 --> 01:19:17,206
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

471
01:19:18,192 --> 01:19:19,816
你拒绝这一切?
That you refuse all this?

472
01:19:22,017 --> 01:19:24,591
我和他谈过了。我知道真相。
I spoke with him. I know the truth.

473
01:19:32,110 --> 01:19:33,912
你对真理了解多少?
What do you know about truth?

474
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:37,423
真相! 这是事实!
The truth! This is the truth!

475
01:19:48,844 --> 01:19:50,751
我们分头行动机会更大。
We'll have a better chance if we split up.

476
01:19:51,767 --> 01:19:53,261
我希望你能来。
I hope you make it.

477
01:19:53,854 --> 01:19:54,885
祝你好运。
Good luck.

478
01:19:56,983 --> 01:19:58,122
Johnathan!
Johnathan!

479
01:20:28,227 --> 01:20:29,781
他跟你说什么了?
What did he tell you?

480
01:20:30,176 --> 01:20:32,572
- 一切。- 比如什么?
- Everything. - Everything like what?

481
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:36,468
一切都要知道。战争还没有结束
Everything there is to know. That the war wasn't over

482
01:20:36,924 --> 01:20:40,295
当你袭击那辆给联盟军运金子的马车时。
when you attacked that stagecoach carrying gold to the confederates.

483
01:20:40,404 --> 01:20:42,942
你和圣马尔韆兄弟。而你却把责任推到他身上
You and the Santa Mar韆 brothers. And you managed to put the blame on him

484
01:20:43,676 --> 01:20:45,822
通过在舞台上放置一些证据。
by planting some evidence on the stage.

485
01:20:47,816 --> 01:20:48,990
但后来...
But then...

486
01:20:49,519 --> 01:20:51,917
那晚他有完美的不在场证明。
He had a perfect alibi that night.

487
01:20:53,104 --> 01:20:55,498
他在这里。他和玛丽在这里。
He was here. He was here with Mary.

488
01:20:56,477 --> 01:20:57,722
但是你...
But you...

489
01:20:58,772 --> 01:21:00,542
你说服玛丽背叛了他。
You convinced Mary to betray him.

490
01:21:02,287 --> 01:21:04,056
她撒了谎，他付出了代价。
She lied, and he paid.

491
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:07,117
现在我知道他为什么要你死了。
Now I know why he wants you dead.

492
01:21:09,387 --> 01:21:13,207
唯一确定的是，我们必须在他杀了你之前，杀了他。
The only thing that's sure, it that we must kill him, before he kills you.

493
01:21:15,439 --> 01:21:19,604
即使这意味着我必须成为一个杀人犯，就像你一样。
Even if it means I must become a murderer, like you.

494
01:21:21,075 --> 01:21:23,780
爸爸。杀死一个无辜的人。
Dad. And kill an innocent man.

495
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:38,041
迪克。
Dick.

496
01:24:18,584 --> 01:24:19,615
等一下!
Wait a minute!

497
01:24:21,575 --> 01:24:22,677
弗兰克!
Frank!

498
01:24:24,462 --> 01:24:26,089
弗兰克, 为什么?
Frank, why?

499
01:24:27,072 --> 01:24:28,769
因为你想要的...
Because you wanted...

500
01:24:29,335 --> 01:24:30,959
有人可以向他开枪。
somebody to shoot at.

501
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:33,290
待着别动，听到了吗?
Just stay put, hear me?

502
01:24:46,001 --> 01:24:47,732
待着别动，胡安尼托。
Stay put yourself, Juanito.

503
01:26:00,593 --> 01:26:01,802
不, 加里。
No, Gary.

504
01:26:11,449 --> 01:26:12,587
不!
No!

505
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:14,848
不。
No.

506
01:26:20,771 --> 01:26:22,123
哦, 加里。
Oh, Gary.

507
01:26:23,102 --> 01:26:24,276
原谅我。
Forgive me.

508
01:26:26,374 --> 01:26:29,849
这么多年了，你还不能原谅我吗? 我很害怕，你一定知道的。
Can't you forgive me after all these years? I was frightenend, you must know that.

509
01:26:30,339 --> 01:26:32,629
他威胁说如果我一开口就杀了我!
He threatened to kill me if I once opened my mouth!

510
01:26:37,367 --> 01:26:40,913
你不知道他对我来说有多混蛋! 我就是个妓女!
You don't know what a bastard he is to me! I'm just some kind of a whore!

511
01:26:43,178 --> 01:26:45,255
这么多年我都没忘记你。
All these years I didn't forget you.

512
01:26:46,831 --> 01:26:48,813
不，等一下! 等一下，加里。
No, wait a minute! Wait a minute Gary.

513
01:26:49,442 --> 01:26:51,244
只有你，他什么都不是!
There's only been you, he was nothing!

514
01:27:46,569 --> 01:27:47,958
带我去见他。
Take me to him.

515
01:28:29,571 --> 01:28:31,517
Acombar! Acombar!
Acombar! Acombar!

516
01:28:32,425 --> 01:28:33,527
Acombar!
Acombar!

517
01:28:46,167 --> 01:28:48,837
Acombar! Acombar!
Acombar! Acombar!

518
01:28:53,091 --> 01:28:55,521
- 他在房子里! - 好吧，我听到了!
- He's in the house! - Alright, I heard you!

519
01:29:06,241 --> 01:29:07,309
当心!
Look out!

520
01:29:12,679 --> 01:29:14,482
迪克! 迪克!
Dick! Dick!

521
01:29:21,584 --> 01:29:22,555
迪克。
Dick.

522
01:29:28,787 --> 01:29:29,996
儿子!
Son!

523
01:30:06,083 --> 01:30:07,222
这是你...
It was you...

524
01:30:08,729 --> 01:30:10,282
这是你的错。
It was your fault.

525
01:30:11,094 --> 01:30:12,410
是你杀了他!
You murdered him!

526
01:30:13,078 --> 01:30:14,181
不!
No!

527
01:30:22,505 --> 01:30:23,535
不。
No.

528
01:30:26,855 --> 01:30:28,408
你杀了我儿子。
You murdered my son.

529
01:30:29,184 --> 01:30:30,252
不!
No!

530
01:30:38,126 --> 01:30:39,716
现在你要为此付出代价!
Now you're gonna pay for it!

531
01:30:40,630 --> 01:30:41,639
不!
No!

532
01:31:48,928 --> 01:31:50,244
嘿，你在下面!
Hey, you down there!

533
01:32:05,348 --> 01:32:06,594
在门口!
At the door!

534
01:32:35,791 --> 01:32:36,965
汉密尔顿!
Hamilton!

535
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:40,764
加里·汉密尔顿? 你在哪里?
Gary Hamilton? Where are you?

536
01:33:00,946 --> 01:33:03,307
汉密尔顿! 加里·汉密尔顿!
Hamilton! Gary Hamilton!

537
01:33:04,426 --> 01:33:05,849
你在哪里?
Where are you?

538
01:33:09,158 --> 01:33:10,367
我在这里。
I'm over here.

539
01:33:14,410 --> 01:33:17,081
你在哪里? 好了，出来吧!
Where are you? Alright, come on out!

540
01:33:36,746 --> 01:33:40,115
你躲在哪里? 你就不能像个男子汉一样出来战斗吗!
Where are you hiding? Can't you just come out and fight like a man!

541
01:34:35,126 --> 01:34:36,586
你在哪里?
