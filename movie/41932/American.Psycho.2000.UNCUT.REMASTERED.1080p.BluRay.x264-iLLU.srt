1
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,962
Our pasta this evening is squid ravioli
in a lemon grass broth

2
00:02:02,045 --> 00:02:05,591
with goat cheese profiteroles,
and I also have an arugula Caesar salad.

3
00:02:05,883 --> 00:02:08,177
For entrées this evening,
I have swordfish meatloaf

4
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,511
with onion marmalade,

5
00:02:09,595 --> 00:02:12,724
rare-roasted partridge breast in
raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale.

6
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:15,602
And grilled free-range rabbit
with herbed french fries.

7
00:02:16,227 --> 00:02:19,397
Our pasta tonight is a squid ravioli
in a lemon grass broth,

8
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,316
and the fish tonight is grilled...

9
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:24,402
With a double espresso.

10
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:26,446
God, I hate this place.

11
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:28,615
It's a chicks' restaurant.
Why aren't we at Dorsia?

12
00:02:28,698 --> 00:02:30,783
Because Bateman won't give
the majtre d' head.

13
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:35,788
Is that Reed Robinson over there?

14
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:37,750
Are you freebasing or what?
That's not Robinson.

15
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,294
- Well, who is it, then?
- It's Paul Allen.

16
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:41,837
That's not Paul Allen.

17
00:02:41,921 --> 00:02:43,964
Paul Allen's on the other side of
the room over there.

18
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:46,508
- Who's he with?
- Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.

19
00:02:46,592 --> 00:02:48,427
They don't have a good bathroom
to do coke in.

20
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,054
Are you sure that's Paul Allen over there?

21
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:51,388
Yes, McDoofus, I am.

22
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:52,765
He's handling the Fisher account.

23
00:02:52,848 --> 00:02:53,974
Lucky bastard.

24
00:02:54,058 --> 00:02:55,476
Lucky Jew bastard.

25
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:58,062
Jesus, McDermott,
what does that have to do with anything?

26
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,064
I've seen that bastard
sitting in his office

27
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,650
talking on the phone to the CEO,
spinning a fuckin' menorah.

28
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:05,195
Not a menorah. You spin a dreidel.

29
00:03:05,278 --> 00:03:06,738
Oh, my God, Bateman,

30
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:09,324
you want me to fry you up
some fuckin' potato pancakes?

31
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:11,534
- Some latkes?
- No, just

32
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,037
cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.

33
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,207
I'd forgotten.
Bateman's dating someone from the ACLU.

34
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,294
He's the voice of reason.
The boy next door.

35
00:03:21,378 --> 00:03:23,255
Speaking of reasonable...

36
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:25,090
Only $570.

37
00:03:26,091 --> 00:03:27,259
Not bad.

38
00:03:27,884 --> 00:03:30,930
- A little something for the purse.
- Give her the $50.

39
00:04:11,096 --> 00:04:12,556
Two Stoli on the rocks.

40
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,932
These aren't good anymore.

41
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:15,726
It's a cash bar.

42
00:04:17,311 --> 00:04:18,812
That'll be $25.

43
00:04:22,232 --> 00:04:24,027
You're a fucking ugly bitch.

44
00:04:24,527 --> 00:04:26,321
I want to stab you to death,

45
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:28,281
then play around with your blood.

46
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:42,253
What can I get for you two?

47
00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:11,283
I live in the American Gardens building
on West 81st Street, on the 11th floor.

48
00:05:12,868 --> 00:05:14,828
My name is Patrick Bateman.

49
00:05:14,912 --> 00:05:16,498
I'm 27 years old.

50
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,210
I believe in taking care of myself,

51
00:05:20,293 --> 00:05:22,170
in a balanced diet,

52
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:24,089
in a rigorous exercise routine.

53
00:05:25,298 --> 00:05:27,634
In the morning,
if my face is a little puffy,

54
00:05:27,717 --> 00:05:30,553
I'll put on an ice pack
while doing my stomach crunches.

55
00:05:31,221 --> 00:05:32,931
I can do 1, 000 now.

56
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,784
After I remove the ice pack,

57
00:05:51,867 --> 00:05:54,245
I use a deep pore cleanser lotion.

58
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:57,832
In the shower,
I use a water-activated gel cleanser...

59
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,128
then a honey-almond body scrub,

60
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,631
and on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub.

61
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:18,145
Then I apply an herb mint facial mask,

62
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:21,857
which I leave on for ten minutes
while I prepare the rest of my routine.

63
00:06:24,776 --> 00:06:26,820
I always use an aftershave lotion

64
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:28,989
with little or no alcohol,

65
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:31,158
because alcohol dries your face out

66
00:06:31,241 --> 00:06:32,868
and makes you look older.

67
00:06:32,951 --> 00:06:34,829
Then moisturizer,

68
00:06:34,912 --> 00:06:36,831
then an anti-aging eye balm,

69
00:06:36,914 --> 00:06:39,959
followed by a final moisturizing
protective lotion.

70
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:44,130
There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman.

71
00:06:45,047 --> 00:06:46,966
Some kind of abstraction.

72
00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:49,135
But there is no real me,

73
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:52,138
only an entity, something illusory,

74
00:06:52,597 --> 00:06:54,891
and though I can hide my cold gaze

75
00:06:54,974 --> 00:06:58,102
and you can shake my hand
and feel flesh gripping yours,

76
00:06:58,186 --> 00:06:59,687
and maybe you can even sense

77
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,107
our lifestyles are probably comparable,

78
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:06,111
I simply am not there.

79
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:35,058
Morning, Hamilton. Nice tan.

80
00:07:40,813 --> 00:07:42,982
Aerobics class, sorry. Any messages?

81
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:44,984
Ricky Harrison has to cancel.

82
00:07:45,068 --> 00:07:46,945
He didn't say what
he was canceling or why.

83
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:50,448
I occasionally box with Ricky
at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?

84
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,118
Spencer wants to meet for drinks
at Flutie's Pier 17.

85
00:07:53,202 --> 00:07:54,703
- When?
- After 6:00.

86
00:07:54,787 --> 00:07:55,955
Negative. Cancel it.

87
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:57,331
And what should I say?

88
00:07:57,414 --> 00:07:58,749
Just say no.

89
00:07:58,832 --> 00:08:00,000
Just say no?

90
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:02,795
Okay, Jean,

91
00:08:02,878 --> 00:08:06,006
I need reservations
for three at Camols at 12:30,

92
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,008
and if not there, try Crayons, all right?

93
00:08:08,092 --> 00:08:09,093
Yes, sir.

94
00:08:10,094 --> 00:08:12,638
Wait, and I need reservations for two

95
00:08:12,721 --> 00:08:15,432
at Arcadia at 8:00 on Thursday.

96
00:08:16,308 --> 00:08:17,685
Something romantic?

97
00:08:18,394 --> 00:08:19,854
No...

98
00:08:21,147 --> 00:08:22,732
Silly.

99
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:24,067
Forget it, I'll make them.

100
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,860
- No, I'll do it.
- No, no.

101
00:08:25,944 --> 00:08:28,321
Be a doll and just get me a mineral water,
okay?

102
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:30,448
You look nice today.

103
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:33,034
Don't wear that outfit again.

104
00:08:33,118 --> 00:08:34,369
What? I didn't hear you.

105
00:08:34,452 --> 00:08:36,746
I said, "Do not wear that outfit again."

106
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,457
Wear a dress, a skirt or something.

107
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:40,959
You don't like this, I take it?

108
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:43,712
Come on, you're prettier than that.

109
00:08:44,546 --> 00:08:46,090
Thanks, Patrick.

110
00:08:46,465 --> 00:08:47,717
I'm not here.

111
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:49,427
And high heels.

112
00:08:49,677 --> 00:08:51,053
I like high heels.

113
00:08:59,979 --> 00:09:01,397
Feathered Friends for 600.

114
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,691
During courtship, the male frigatebird

115
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:06,485
inflates to enormous size
the red pouch found here.

116
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:23,587
Thousands of roses,

117
00:09:23,795 --> 00:09:25,589
and lots of chocolate truffles,

118
00:09:25,672 --> 00:09:28,383
Godiva, and oysters on the half shell...

119
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,219
I'm trying to listen to
the new Robert Palmer tape,

120
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:33,430
but Evelyn, my supposed fiancée,

121
00:09:33,513 --> 00:09:34,931
keeps buzzing in my ear.

122
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:38,895
Annie Leibovitz.
We'll get Annie Leibovitz.

123
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,397
And we'll have to get
someone to videotape.

124
00:09:42,523 --> 00:09:44,317
Patrick, we should do it.

125
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:47,278
Do what?

126
00:09:47,362 --> 00:09:48,571
Get married. Have a wedding.

127
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,615
No, I can't take the time off work.

128
00:09:50,698 --> 00:09:53,284
Your father practically owns the company.
You can do anything you like.

129
00:09:53,368 --> 00:09:54,619
I don't want to talk about it.

130
00:09:54,702 --> 00:09:56,621
You hate that job anyway.

131
00:09:56,704 --> 00:09:58,164
I don't see why you just don't quit.

132
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:02,210
Because I want to fit in.

133
00:10:13,722 --> 00:10:15,224
Williams party.

134
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:18,936
I'm on the verge of tears
by the time we arrive at Espace,

135
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,563
since I'm positive
we won't have a decent table,

136
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:23,357
but we do,

137
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,694
and relief washes over me
in an awesome wave.

138
00:10:26,777 --> 00:10:30,031
Patrick, this is my cousin Vanden
and her boyfriend, Stash.

139
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:32,409
They're both artists.

140
00:10:32,492 --> 00:10:34,494
- The menu is in Braille.
- I see you've met everyone.

141
00:10:34,577 --> 00:10:35,704
You look awesome.

142
00:10:37,622 --> 00:10:39,582
Okay, all right.

143
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:45,255
I'm fairly certain that Timothy Bryce
and Evelyn are having an affair.

144
00:10:45,922 --> 00:10:48,383
Timothy is the only
interesting person I know.

145
00:10:48,842 --> 00:10:50,385
I'm almost completely indifferent

146
00:10:50,468 --> 00:10:53,513
as to whether Evelyn knows
I'm having an affair

147
00:10:53,596 --> 00:10:57,101
with Courtney Rawlinson,
her closest friend.

148
00:10:57,768 --> 00:10:59,562
Courtney is almost perfect-looking.

149
00:11:00,521 --> 00:11:03,065
She's usually operating on
one or more psychiatric drugs.

150
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:05,317
Tonight, I believe it's Xanax.

151
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:07,445
More disturbing than her drug use, though,

152
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:10,656
is the fact that she's engaged
to Luis Carruthers,

153
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,450
the biggest doofus in the business.

154
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:14,160
Tell me, Stash,

155
00:11:14,827 --> 00:11:18,330
do you think Soho
is becoming too commercial?

156
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:19,999
Yes, I read that.

157
00:11:20,082 --> 00:11:21,792
Who gives a rat's ass?

158
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:23,211
Hey, that affects us.

159
00:11:23,295 --> 00:11:24,296
Oh.

160
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:26,840
Well, what about the massacres
in Sri Lanka, honey?

161
00:11:26,923 --> 00:11:28,049
Doesn't that affect us, too?

162
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:29,801
I mean, do you know
anything about Sri Lanka?

163
00:11:29,885 --> 00:11:32,512
How, like, the Sikhs are killing
like tons of Israelis over there?

164
00:11:32,596 --> 00:11:33,805
Come on, Bryce.

165
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:37,559
There are a lot more important problems
than Sri Lanka to worry about.

166
00:11:37,642 --> 00:11:38,643
Like what?

167
00:11:38,727 --> 00:11:40,812
Well, we have to end apartheid, for one,

168
00:11:41,146 --> 00:11:43,231
and slow down the nuclear arms race,

169
00:11:43,732 --> 00:11:46,485
stop terrorism, and world hunger.

170
00:11:46,735 --> 00:11:50,782
We have to provide food and shelter
for the homeless,

171
00:11:50,865 --> 00:11:52,700
and oppose racial discrimination

172
00:11:52,784 --> 00:11:54,619
and promote civil rights,

173
00:11:54,702 --> 00:11:57,705
while also promoting
equal rights for women.

174
00:11:57,789 --> 00:12:00,208
We have to encourage a return

175
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,503
to traditional moral values.

176
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,338
Most importantly,

177
00:12:05,421 --> 00:12:08,633
we have to promote general social concern

178
00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:12,178
and less materialism in young people.

179
00:12:14,055 --> 00:12:15,516
Patrick...

180
00:12:16,475 --> 00:12:17,976
how thoughtful of you.

181
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:55,974
Hello.

182
00:12:57,642 --> 00:12:58,935
Hello.

183
00:13:17,705 --> 00:13:19,707
Bleach-ee?
Are you trying to say "bleaching"?

184
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,709
Bleach-ee. Oh, my God. Two things.

185
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:24,795
One, you can't bleach a Cerruti.
Out of the question.

186
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:27,256
Two, I can only get
these sheets in Santa Fe.

187
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,508
These are very expensive sheets
and I really need them clean.

188
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:32,177
If you don't shut your fucking mouth,

189
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:33,637
I will kill you.

190
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:37,017
I have a lunch meeting at Hubert's
in 20 minutes with Ronald Harrison,

191
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,060
and I need those sheets clean
by this afternoon.

192
00:13:39,144 --> 00:13:41,271
Listen, I cannot understand you!

193
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:42,814
This is crazy. You're a fool.

194
00:13:42,898 --> 00:13:44,858
I can't cope with this. Stupid bitch-ee!

195
00:13:44,941 --> 00:13:46,276
Understand?

196
00:13:47,068 --> 00:13:48,403
Patrick?

197
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,406
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.

198
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:52,699
Hello, missus.

199
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:55,285
Isn't it ridiculous coming
all the way up here?

200
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:56,578
But they really are the best.

201
00:13:56,661 --> 00:13:58,747
Then why can't they get these stains out?

202
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,958
I mean, can you talk to
these people or something?

203
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:02,209
I'm not getting anywhere.

204
00:14:02,293 --> 00:14:03,628
What are those?

205
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,923
Well, it's cranberry juice. Cranapple.

206
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:08,424
Really?

207
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:10,217
Listen, if you could talk to them,

208
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:12,178
I would really appreciate it.
I'm really late.

209
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:14,430
I have a lunch appointment
at Hubert's in 15 minutes.

210
00:14:14,513 --> 00:14:16,015
Hubert's? That moved uptown, right?

211
00:14:16,098 --> 00:14:18,184
Well, oh, boy, listen, I've gotta go.

212
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:19,143
Thank you, Victoria.

213
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:21,228
Maybe we could do lunch one day next week?

214
00:14:21,312 --> 00:14:23,147
I don't know, Victoria.
I'm at work all the time.

215
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,982
What about a Saturday?

216
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:27,444
- Next Saturday?
- Sure.

217
00:14:27,527 --> 00:14:29,529
Can't, I'm afraid.
I have a matinee of Les Mis.

218
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:30,697
I really got to go...

219
00:14:30,781 --> 00:14:32,324
I'll... Christ. I'll call you.

220
00:14:32,407 --> 00:14:34,076
Okay. Do.

221
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:37,037
Listen, you're dating Luis.
He's in Arizona.

222
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,039
You're fucking me,
and we haven't made plans.

223
00:14:39,122 --> 00:14:40,707
What could you possibly be up to tonight?

224
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,250
Stop it. I'm...

225
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:43,710
On a lot of lithium?

226
00:14:43,794 --> 00:14:45,420
Waiting for Luis to call me.

227
00:14:45,504 --> 00:14:47,047
He said he'd call tonight.

228
00:14:47,381 --> 00:14:48,590
Pumpkin...

229
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:50,676
Pumpkin, you're dating an asshole.

230
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,639
Pumpkin, you're dating
the biggest dickweed in New York.

231
00:14:55,223 --> 00:14:58,393
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling,
tumbling dickweed.

232
00:14:58,851 --> 00:15:02,021
Patrick, stop calling me pumpkin, okay?

233
00:15:02,438 --> 00:15:04,023
I have to go.

234
00:15:04,315 --> 00:15:05,483
Courtney!

235
00:15:05,984 --> 00:15:07,819
- Dinner.
- I can't!

236
00:15:07,902 --> 00:15:09,320
I'm thinking Dorsia.

237
00:15:12,115 --> 00:15:13,533
Dorsia's nice.

238
00:15:13,616 --> 00:15:15,535
Wear something fabulous.

239
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:29,800
Dorsia.

240
00:15:29,883 --> 00:15:32,011
Yes, I know it's a little late,

241
00:15:32,094 --> 00:15:34,388
but is it possible
to reserve a table for two

242
00:15:34,471 --> 00:15:36,557
at 8:00 or 8:30, perhaps?

243
00:15:54,034 --> 00:15:57,454
A facial at Elizabeth Arden,
which was really relaxing,

244
00:15:58,955 --> 00:16:01,166
and then to the Pottery Barn,

245
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:05,920
where I got this little
silver muffin dish.

246
00:16:06,546 --> 00:16:07,547
Is that Donald Trump's car?

247
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,632
God, Patrick, shut up.

248
00:16:09,716 --> 00:16:11,594
You know, Courtney,
you should take some more lithium

249
00:16:11,677 --> 00:16:14,430
or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine
might get you out of this slump.

250
00:16:15,514 --> 00:16:17,433
I just want a child.

251
00:16:18,642 --> 00:16:20,102
Just two...

252
00:16:20,686 --> 00:16:22,396
perfect...

253
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:25,024
children.

254
00:16:29,737 --> 00:16:31,405
Are we here?

255
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:32,823
Yeah.

256
00:16:40,123 --> 00:16:41,875
This is Dorsia?

257
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,460
Yes, dear.

258
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,463
Courtney, you're gonna have
the peanut butter soup

259
00:16:46,546 --> 00:16:48,799
with smoked duck and mashed squash.

260
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,928
New York Matinee called it
"A playful, but mysterious little dish."

261
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:54,387
You'll love it.

262
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,265
And then the red snapper
with violets and pine nuts.

263
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,101
I think that'll follow nicely.

264
00:17:01,728 --> 00:17:03,355
Thanks, Patrick.

265
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,781
Patrick, thanks so much
for looking after Courtney.

266
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,534
Dorsia, how impressive.

267
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,994
How on earth did you get
a reservation there?

268
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,454
Lucky, I guess.

269
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,541
That's a wonderful suit.

270
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,543
Don't tell me, don't tell me,
let me guess.

271
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,171
Valentino couture.

272
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,592
It looks so soft.

273
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:33,011
Your compliment was sufficient, Luis.

274
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,890
Hello, Halberstram. Nice tie.

275
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,309
How the hell are ya?

276
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:42,729
Allen has mistaken me for this
dickhead Marcus Halberstram.

277
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:45,649
It seems logical because Marcus
also works at P&P, and in fact,

278
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,568
does the same exact thing I do.

279
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:50,154
He also has a penchant for Valentino suits

280
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,947
and Oliver Peoples glasses.

281
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,824
Marcus and I even go to the same barber,

282
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,909
although I have a slightly better haircut.

283
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:57,871
So how's the ransom account going, Marcus?

284
00:17:57,954 --> 00:17:59,664
- It's all right.
- Really?

285
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:01,332
That's interesting. It's not,

286
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,293
- it's not great.
- Well, you know.

287
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:05,837
So how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.

288
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,672
Yeah. I'm very lucky.

289
00:18:08,214 --> 00:18:09,215
Hey, Allen!

290
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,134
Congratulations on the Fisher account.

291
00:18:11,217 --> 00:18:12,302
Thank you, Baxter.

292
00:18:12,385 --> 00:18:14,345
Listen, Paul. Squash?

293
00:18:18,308 --> 00:18:19,642
Call me.

294
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,147
- How about Friday?
- No can do.

295
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:25,941
I got an 8:30 res at Dorsia.

296
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:28,903
Great sea urchin ceviche.

297
00:18:29,778 --> 00:18:32,281
Dorsia on a Friday night?
How'd he swing that?

298
00:18:32,531 --> 00:18:33,949
I think he's lying.

299
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:38,078
Is that a gram?

300
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:41,457
New card. What do you think?

301
00:18:44,084 --> 00:18:45,419
Very nice.

302
00:18:46,003 --> 00:18:47,129
Look at that.

303
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:49,132
Picked them up from
the printer's yesterday.

304
00:18:49,216 --> 00:18:51,009
- Good coloring.
- That's bone.

305
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:53,929
And the lettering is something
called Silian Rail.

306
00:18:54,012 --> 00:18:56,181
It's very cool, Bateman,
but that's nothing.

307
00:18:56,431 --> 00:18:58,141
Look at this.

308
00:18:58,225 --> 00:19:00,018
That is really nice.

309
00:19:00,101 --> 00:19:02,270
Eggshell with Romalian type.

310
00:19:03,313 --> 00:19:04,314
What do you think?

311
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,900
Nice.

312
00:19:06,983 --> 00:19:09,569
Jesus. That is really super.

313
00:19:09,653 --> 00:19:11,571
How did a nitwit like you get so tasteful?

314
00:19:12,405 --> 00:19:16,410
I can't believe that Bryce
prefers Van Patten's card to mine.

315
00:19:16,494 --> 00:19:17,954
But wait.

316
00:19:18,246 --> 00:19:20,081
You ain't seen nothing yet.

317
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,460
Raised lettering, pale nimbus,

318
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:26,379
white.

319
00:19:27,463 --> 00:19:28,965
Impressive.

320
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:30,049
Very nice.

321
00:19:32,677 --> 00:19:34,220
Let's see Paul Allen's card.

322
00:19:48,652 --> 00:19:50,904
Look at that subtle off-white coloring.

323
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:53,240
The tasteful thickness of it.

324
00:19:53,782 --> 00:19:55,033
Oh, my God,

325
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:56,994
it even has a watermark.

326
00:20:01,581 --> 00:20:03,625
Is something wrong, Patrick?

327
00:20:04,543 --> 00:20:05,502
You're sweating.

328
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,576
Hello.

329
00:20:36,744 --> 00:20:39,705
Pat Bateman. You want some money?

330
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:41,915
Some food?

331
00:20:44,418 --> 00:20:45,419
This what you need?

332
00:20:45,502 --> 00:20:46,837
I'm hungry.

333
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,505
Yeah. Cold out, too, isn't it?

334
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:54,386
Why don't you get a job?

335
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,597
If you're so hungry,
why don't you get a job?

336
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,057
I lost my job.

337
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,727
Why? You drinking?

338
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:03,021
Is that why you lost it?

339
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,939
Insider trading?

340
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,775
Just joking.

341
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:08,860
Listen, what's your name?

342
00:21:08,943 --> 00:21:10,111
AI.

343
00:21:10,195 --> 00:21:11,488
Speak up. Come on.

344
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:14,324
- AI.
- Get a goddamn job, AI.

345
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,409
You got a negative attitude.

346
00:21:16,493 --> 00:21:17,911
That's what's stopping you.

347
00:21:17,994 --> 00:21:19,496
You gotta get your act together.

348
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:20,872
I'll help you.

349
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,375
You are so kind, mister.

350
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,543
You're kind. You're a kind man.

351
00:21:25,627 --> 00:21:26,796
- It's okay.
- I can tell.

352
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:29,090
Please, you gotta tell me what to do.

353
00:21:29,173 --> 00:21:32,551
You gotta help me.
I'm so cold, I'm hungry.

354
00:21:34,553 --> 00:21:36,222
You know how bad you smell?

355
00:21:36,555 --> 00:21:38,849
You reek of shit. Do you know that?

356
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:41,268
AI...

357
00:21:42,728 --> 00:21:44,188
I'm sorry.

358
00:21:44,271 --> 00:21:45,815
It's just that...

359
00:21:45,898 --> 00:21:47,108
I don't know.

360
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,195
I don't have anything in common with you.

361
00:21:59,788 --> 00:22:02,249
Thank you, mister. Thank you.

362
00:22:04,126 --> 00:22:05,710
I'm cold out here.

363
00:22:05,794 --> 00:22:07,337
You know what a fucking loser you are?

364
00:22:07,421 --> 00:22:08,672
What?

365
00:22:32,864 --> 00:22:35,158
What beautiful skin you have, Mr. Bateman.

366
00:22:36,242 --> 00:22:38,744
So fine, so smooth.

367
00:22:46,753 --> 00:22:49,298
I have all the characteristics
of a human being:

368
00:22:49,715 --> 00:22:52,301
flesh, blood, skin, hair,

369
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:55,846
but not a single clear
identifiable emotion

370
00:22:56,555 --> 00:22:58,932
except for greed and disgust.

371
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,936
Something horrible
is happening inside of me,

372
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,563
and I don't know why.

373
00:23:06,023 --> 00:23:09,193
My nightly blood lust
has overflowed into my days.

374
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:12,864
I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy.

375
00:23:13,448 --> 00:23:16,075
I think my mask of sanity
is about to slip.

376
00:23:28,922 --> 00:23:31,341
Hey, McCoy, what do you say?

377
00:23:32,217 --> 00:23:34,260
Hey, Hamilton,
have a holly, jolly Christmas.

378
00:23:34,344 --> 00:23:36,387
Is Allen still handling
the Fisher account?

379
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,390
Of course. Who else?

380
00:23:38,766 --> 00:23:41,185
Mistletoe alert. Merry X-mas, Patrick.

381
00:23:42,102 --> 00:23:43,229
Merry X-mas, Harry.

382
00:23:44,021 --> 00:23:45,856
- Merry Christmas.
- You're late, honey.

383
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,358
- No, I'm not late.
- Yes, you are.

384
00:23:47,441 --> 00:23:49,985
I've been here the entire time,
you just didn't see me.

385
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:51,529
Say hello to Snowball.

386
00:23:51,612 --> 00:23:54,406
Snowball says, "Merry Christmas, Patrick."

387
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,824
What is it?

388
00:23:55,908 --> 00:23:57,826
It's a baby piggy-wiggy, isn't it?

389
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,162
It's a Vietnamese potbellied pig.

390
00:24:00,246 --> 00:24:02,831
They make darling pets. Don't you?

391
00:24:03,249 --> 00:24:04,334
Don't you?

392
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,795
Stop scowling, Patrick.

393
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,255
You're such a Grinch.

394
00:24:08,338 --> 00:24:10,382
What does Mr. Grinch want for Christmas?

395
00:24:10,465 --> 00:24:12,133
And don't say breast implants again.

396
00:24:15,345 --> 00:24:18,265
- Allen.
- Marcus! Merry Christmas.

397
00:24:18,348 --> 00:24:20,517
How you been? Workaholic, I suppose?

398
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,060
I haven't seen you in a while.

399
00:24:22,686 --> 00:24:23,979
Hey, Hamilton!

400
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,897
We're going to Nell's. Limo's out front.

401
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:27,857
We should have dinner.

402
00:24:27,941 --> 00:24:29,609
Maybe you could bring...

403
00:24:29,943 --> 00:24:32,113
- Cecilia?
- Yes, Cecilia!

404
00:24:32,196 --> 00:24:34,574
Cecilia would adore it.

405
00:24:34,824 --> 00:24:36,492
Well, then let's do it, Marcus.

406
00:24:36,993 --> 00:24:38,703
- Great party.
- Thanks.

407
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,080
Patrick, why is he calling you Marcus?

408
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:43,916
Mistletoe alert.

409
00:24:52,508 --> 00:24:54,552
Marcus Halberstram for two at 7:00.

410
00:24:56,972 --> 00:24:58,640
No, I want to know.

411
00:24:58,724 --> 00:25:00,892
Okay, I came here for
the cilantro crawfish gumbo,

412
00:25:00,976 --> 00:25:03,854
which is, after all, the only
excuse one could have for being

413
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:05,230
in this restaurant which is,

414
00:25:05,314 --> 00:25:07,024
by the way, almost completely empty.

415
00:25:07,107 --> 00:25:09,901
- I'm very sorry, sir.
- J&B straight, and a Corona.

416
00:25:10,193 --> 00:25:12,696
- Would you like to hear...
- Double Absolut martini.

417
00:25:13,113 --> 00:25:14,364
Yes, sir.

418
00:25:14,448 --> 00:25:15,866
Would you like to hear the specials?

419
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:17,784
Not if you want to keep your spleen.

420
00:25:21,288 --> 00:25:24,000
This is a real
beehive of activity, Halberstram.

421
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:26,252
This place is hot. Very hot.

422
00:25:26,336 --> 00:25:30,423
Listen, the mud soup and charcoal arugula
are outrageous here.

423
00:25:30,506 --> 00:25:31,841
Yeah, well, you're late.

424
00:25:31,924 --> 00:25:34,469
Hey, I'm a child of divorce.
Give me a break.

425
00:25:36,095 --> 00:25:38,848
I see they've omitted
the pork loin with lime Jell-O.

426
00:25:38,931 --> 00:25:40,433
We should've gone to Dorsia.

427
00:25:40,725 --> 00:25:42,435
I could have gotten us a table.

428
00:25:42,518 --> 00:25:43,811
Nobody goes there anymore.

429
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,940
Is that Ivana Trump?

430
00:25:48,983 --> 00:25:50,569
Jeez, Patrick...

431
00:25:50,653 --> 00:25:51,737
I mean, Marcus...

432
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,238
What are you thinking?

433
00:25:53,322 --> 00:25:55,532
Why would Ivana be at Texarkana?

434
00:25:56,742 --> 00:25:57,701
So,

435
00:25:57,785 --> 00:26:00,621
wasn't Rothschild originally
handling the Fisher account?

436
00:26:00,704 --> 00:26:01,830
How'd you get it?

437
00:26:01,914 --> 00:26:04,541
Well, I could tell you that, Halberstram,

438
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:07,044
but then I'd have to kill you.

439
00:26:15,094 --> 00:26:16,596
I like to dissect girls.

440
00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:18,515
Did you know I'm utterly insane?

441
00:26:21,184 --> 00:26:23,728
Great tan, Marcus. Really impressive.

442
00:26:23,812 --> 00:26:25,605
- Where do you tan?
- Salon.

443
00:26:25,689 --> 00:26:28,024
I've got a tanning bed at home.
You should look into it.

444
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,026
And...

445
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,237
Cecilia... how is she?

446
00:26:32,612 --> 00:26:33,697
Where is she tonight?

447
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,115
Cecilia is...

448
00:26:35,198 --> 00:26:36,408
Well, you know Cecilia.

449
00:26:36,491 --> 00:26:38,535
I think she's having dinner with

450
00:26:38,827 --> 00:26:40,036
Evelyn Williams.

451
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,121
Evelyn.

452
00:26:41,831 --> 00:26:42,832
Great ass.

453
00:26:42,915 --> 00:26:45,751
Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman.
What a dork.

454
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:49,046
Another martini, Paul?

455
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:56,846
You like Huey Lewis and the News?

456
00:26:57,096 --> 00:26:59,056
They're okay.

457
00:27:01,183 --> 00:27:04,937
Their early work was
a little too new wave for my taste.

458
00:27:05,396 --> 00:27:07,732
But when Sports came out in '83,

459
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:09,901
I think they really came into their own,

460
00:27:09,985 --> 00:27:11,319
commercially and artistically.

461
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:16,867
The whole album has a clear, crisp sound,

462
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:19,828
and a new sheen of
consummate professionalism

463
00:27:19,911 --> 00:27:22,372
that really gives the songs a big boost.

464
00:27:32,507 --> 00:27:34,886
He's been compared to Elvis Costello,

465
00:27:34,969 --> 00:27:36,763
but I think Huey has a far more bitter,

466
00:27:36,846 --> 00:27:38,556
cynical sense of humor.

467
00:27:39,766 --> 00:27:41,684
- Hey, Halberstram.
- Yes, Allen?

468
00:27:41,768 --> 00:27:44,395
Why are there copies of
the Style section all over the place?

469
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:46,564
Do you... Do you have a dog?

470
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:48,691
A little chow or something?

471
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:50,985
No, Allen.

472
00:27:51,068 --> 00:27:52,320
Is that a raincoat?

473
00:27:52,403 --> 00:27:53,613
Yes, it is.

474
00:27:55,198 --> 00:27:57,575
In '87, Huey released this,

475
00:27:57,658 --> 00:27:59,494
Fore!, their most accomplished album.

476
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:02,956
I think their undisputed masterpiece
is "Hip To Be Square."

477
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,291
The song's so catchy.

478
00:28:04,374 --> 00:28:06,460
Most people probably
don't listen to the lyrics.

479
00:28:06,543 --> 00:28:07,628
But they should,

480
00:28:07,711 --> 00:28:10,088
because it's not just about
the pleasures of conformity

481
00:28:10,172 --> 00:28:11,590
and the importance of trends.

482
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:14,760
It's also a personal statement
about the band itself.

483
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,261
Hey, Paul!

484
00:28:21,975 --> 00:28:24,394
Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now,

485
00:28:24,478 --> 00:28:26,689
you fucking stupid bastard!

486
00:28:29,818 --> 00:28:32,362
You fucking bastard!

487
00:29:30,589 --> 00:29:33,383
He was completely naked
and he was standing

488
00:29:33,466 --> 00:29:36,052
on the table, with no clothes on...

489
00:29:37,637 --> 00:29:39,180
Patrick? Patrick!

490
00:29:40,515 --> 00:29:41,808
Is that you?

491
00:29:41,892 --> 00:29:45,103
No, Luis, it's not me. You're mistaken.

492
00:29:45,186 --> 00:29:47,356
This is my very good friend,
Patrick Bateman.

493
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,066
Where are you going?

494
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,234
We're going to Nell's.

495
00:29:50,318 --> 00:29:51,611
Gwendolyn's father is buying it.

496
00:29:55,907 --> 00:29:57,909
Where did you get that overnight bag?

497
00:29:59,952 --> 00:30:01,579
Jean Paul Gaultier.

498
00:30:13,926 --> 00:30:17,512
When I get to Paul Allen's place,
I use the keys I took from his pocket

499
00:30:17,596 --> 00:30:19,056
before disposing of the body.

500
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:22,267
There is a moment of sheer panic

501
00:30:22,935 --> 00:30:25,812
when I realize that Paul's apartment
overlooks the park

502
00:30:27,356 --> 00:30:29,441
and it's obviously
more expensive than mine.

503
00:30:33,236 --> 00:30:35,989
I calm myself and move into the bedroom,

504
00:30:36,073 --> 00:30:38,785
where I find his suitcase
and start to pack.

505
00:30:39,994 --> 00:30:41,829
It's time for Paul to take a little trip.

506
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:46,542
Where to send the bastard?

507
00:30:47,335 --> 00:30:48,836
Dallas?

508
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,047
Paris? Singapore?

509
00:30:51,965 --> 00:30:54,133
London. I'll send the ass to London.

510
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:03,601
Hi, this is Paul.

511
00:31:03,685 --> 00:31:05,562
I've been called away
to London for a few days.

512
00:31:05,646 --> 00:31:07,648
Meredith, I'll call you when I get back.

513
00:31:07,731 --> 00:31:09,233
Hasta la vista, baby.

514
00:31:34,676 --> 00:31:35,760
What is it?

515
00:31:36,845 --> 00:31:38,263
Patrick?

516
00:31:38,513 --> 00:31:40,098
Yes, Jean?

517
00:31:40,473 --> 00:31:42,559
There's a Mr. Donald Kimball
here to see you.

518
00:31:42,642 --> 00:31:43,768
Who?

519
00:31:43,852 --> 00:31:45,770
Detective Donald Kimball.

520
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,484
Tell him I'm at lunch.

521
00:31:52,694 --> 00:31:56,031
Patrick, it's only 10:30.
I think he knows you're here.

522
00:31:56,824 --> 00:31:58,367
Send him in, I guess.

523
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:08,794
Now, John, you've gotta wear clothes
in proportion to your physique.

524
00:32:09,253 --> 00:32:11,255
There are definite dos and don'ts,
good buddy,

525
00:32:11,338 --> 00:32:12,798
of wearing a bold-striped shirt.

526
00:32:12,882 --> 00:32:15,676
A bold-striped shirt
calls for solid-colored

527
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,095
or discreetly patterned suits and ties.

528
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:21,182
Yes, always tip the stylist 15%.

529
00:32:22,183 --> 00:32:25,103
Listen, John, I've got to go.
T. Boone Pickens just walked in.

530
00:32:25,562 --> 00:32:27,105
Just joking.

531
00:32:27,189 --> 00:32:29,191
No, don't tip the owner of the salon.

532
00:32:30,275 --> 00:32:31,777
Okay, John? Right.

533
00:32:32,152 --> 00:32:33,278
Got it.

534
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:35,530
Sorry about that.

535
00:32:35,614 --> 00:32:38,075
No, I'm sorry.
I should've made an appointment.

536
00:32:38,283 --> 00:32:40,118
Was that anything important?

537
00:32:40,202 --> 00:32:42,996
That? Just mulling over business problems,

538
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,832
examining opportunities,
exchanging rumors,

539
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:47,876
spreading gossip.

540
00:32:49,378 --> 00:32:51,589
Hi. I'm Donald Kimball.

541
00:32:52,423 --> 00:32:54,717
Hi, Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.

542
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:56,385
Sorry to barge in on you like this.

543
00:32:56,469 --> 00:32:58,554
I know how busy you guys can get.

544
00:33:01,057 --> 00:33:02,892
So, what's the...

545
00:33:04,393 --> 00:33:05,686
topic of discussion?

546
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,688
I've been hired by Meredith Powell

547
00:33:08,523 --> 00:33:11,025
to investigate the disappearance
of Paul Allen.

548
00:33:12,777 --> 00:33:14,278
I see.

549
00:33:14,362 --> 00:33:15,572
Paul's disappearance, yeah.

550
00:33:15,656 --> 00:33:17,324
So it's nothing that official.

551
00:33:17,407 --> 00:33:19,243
I just have some basic questions
about Paul Allen,

552
00:33:19,326 --> 00:33:20,661
- about yourself...
- Coffee?

553
00:33:20,744 --> 00:33:21,912
No, I'm okay.

554
00:33:21,995 --> 00:33:23,914
- Apollinaris?
- No, I'm okay.

555
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:27,334
Can you bring Mr...

556
00:33:27,584 --> 00:33:29,670
- Kimball.
- Mr. Kimball a bottle of Apollin...

557
00:33:29,753 --> 00:33:31,338
- No, really, I'm okay.
- It's no problem.

558
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,677
So, what's the topic of discussion?

559
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,763
The disappearance of Paul Allen.

560
00:33:39,847 --> 00:33:41,223
Right.

561
00:33:41,306 --> 00:33:43,476
Well, I haven't...

562
00:33:44,978 --> 00:33:48,481
I haven't heard anything about
the disappearance or anything,

563
00:33:48,565 --> 00:33:50,775
not on Page Six, at least.

564
00:33:51,151 --> 00:33:52,986
I think his family wants this kept quiet.

565
00:33:53,069 --> 00:33:54,445
Understandable. Lime?

566
00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:56,573
No, no, really, I'm okay.

567
00:33:56,656 --> 00:33:58,158
You sure? I can always get you a lime.

568
00:33:58,241 --> 00:34:01,661
Just some preliminary questions
that I need for my own files, okay?

569
00:34:01,744 --> 00:34:03,037
Shoot.

570
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:05,915
- How old are you?
- Twenty-seven.

571
00:34:06,624 --> 00:34:07,917
Where did you go to school?

572
00:34:08,002 --> 00:34:09,837
Harvard, then Harvard Business School.

573
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,921
Your address?

574
00:34:11,005 --> 00:34:13,299
The American Gardens building,
West 81 st Street.

575
00:34:13,799 --> 00:34:15,301
Nice. Very nice.

576
00:34:15,551 --> 00:34:16,594
Thanks.

577
00:34:16,927 --> 00:34:19,096
What can you tell me about Paul Allen?

578
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,598
I'm at a loss.

579
00:34:20,681 --> 00:34:22,725
He was part of that whole Yale thing.

580
00:34:22,808 --> 00:34:24,810
- "Yale thing"?
- Yeah, Yale thing.

581
00:34:24,894 --> 00:34:26,478
What do you mean, "Yale thing"?

582
00:34:26,562 --> 00:34:30,524
Well, I think for one that
he was probably a closet homosexual

583
00:34:30,608 --> 00:34:32,193
who did a lot of cocaine.

584
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,111
That "Yale thing."

585
00:34:35,197 --> 00:34:36,615
What kind of man was he?

586
00:34:36,698 --> 00:34:38,950
Besides the information
you've just given me.

587
00:34:39,034 --> 00:34:40,785
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.

588
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:42,162
Do you feel like that?

589
00:34:42,662 --> 00:34:44,080
No, not really.

590
00:34:45,957 --> 00:34:47,375
Where did Paul hang out?

591
00:34:47,959 --> 00:34:49,920
- Hang out?
- Yeah, you know, hang out.

592
00:34:50,003 --> 00:34:51,713
Let me think.

593
00:34:51,796 --> 00:34:54,174
The Newport, Harry's,

594
00:34:54,257 --> 00:34:56,551
Flutie's, Indochine,

595
00:34:56,635 --> 00:34:58,220
Nell's, the Cornell Club,

596
00:34:58,303 --> 00:34:59,596
the New York Yacht Club.

597
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:00,681
He had a yacht?

598
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,183
No, he just hung out there.

599
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,227
And where did he go to school?

600
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,271
Don't you know this?

601
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,148
I just wanted to know if you know.

602
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,447
Before Yale, if I remember correctly,
Saint Paul's.

603
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,449
Listen, I just...

604
00:35:18,532 --> 00:35:19,951
I just want to help.

605
00:35:21,535 --> 00:35:22,703
I understand.

606
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,042
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?

607
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,045
Well, there's a message
on his answering machine

608
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,255
that says he went to London.

609
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:32,381
Maybe he did, huh?

610
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:35,133
- His girlfriend doesn't think so.
- But has anyone seen him in London?

611
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,677
Actually, yes,

612
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,429
but I've had a hard time getting
actual verification.

613
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:43,183
A Stephen Hughes said
he saw him at a restaurant there.

614
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:44,810
But I checked it out, and what happened is

615
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:47,229
he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth for Paul,
so...

616
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,231
Had his apartment been burglarized?

617
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,899
No, actually, it hadn't.

618
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:54,696
Toiletries were missing, a suit was gone,
so was some luggage. That's it.

619
00:35:54,779 --> 00:35:57,198
I mean, no one's dealing with
the homicide squad yet or anything, right?

620
00:35:57,282 --> 00:35:59,200
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure.

621
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:01,911
Basically,
no one's seen or heard anything.

622
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,913
So typical, isn't it?

623
00:36:03,997 --> 00:36:05,123
It's just strange.

624
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,458
One day someone's walking around,

625
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:10,253
going to work, alive, and then...

626
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:11,379
Nothing.

627
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:14,257
People just disappear.

628
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:18,428
The Earth just opens up and swallows them.

629
00:36:19,722 --> 00:36:21,098
Eerie.

630
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:22,558
Really eerie.

631
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,607
Listen, you'll have to excuse me.

632
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:34,403
I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable
at the Four Seasons in 20 minutes.

633
00:36:35,154 --> 00:36:36,905
The Four Seasons?

634
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:38,615
Isn't that a little far uptown?

635
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:40,409
I mean, aren't you going to be late?

636
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:42,328
No, there's one down here.

637
00:36:42,745 --> 00:36:45,080
- Really? I didn't know that.
- Yes. It's very good.

638
00:36:45,164 --> 00:36:46,333
Listen,

639
00:36:46,416 --> 00:36:49,085
if anything else occurs to you,
any information...

640
00:36:49,169 --> 00:36:50,920
Absolutely. I'm 100% with you.

641
00:36:51,004 --> 00:36:52,714
Great, and...

642
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,550
thanks for your time, Mr. Bateman.

643
00:36:59,554 --> 00:37:00,930
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.

644
00:38:01,284 --> 00:38:02,953
I haven't seen you around here.

645
00:38:03,036 --> 00:38:04,414
You just haven't been looking.

646
00:38:04,497 --> 00:38:06,207
Would you like to see my apartment?

647
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:08,960
I'm not supposed to.

648
00:38:11,045 --> 00:38:13,005
Do you want to come to
my apartment or not?

649
00:38:14,924 --> 00:38:18,511
I'm not supposed to,
but I can make an exception.

650
00:38:21,889 --> 00:38:23,141
Do you take a credit card?

651
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,435
I'm joking.

652
00:38:25,518 --> 00:38:26,894
Come on, get in.

653
00:38:38,073 --> 00:38:40,534
I'd like a girl, early 20s, blonde,

654
00:38:41,368 --> 00:38:43,579
who does couples. Couples.

655
00:38:43,662 --> 00:38:46,540
And I really can't stress blonde enough.

656
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,125
Blonde.

657
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,671
I'm Paul.

658
00:38:52,754 --> 00:38:54,465
My name's Paul Allen.

659
00:38:54,548 --> 00:38:55,674
You got that?

660
00:38:56,675 --> 00:38:58,052
You're Christie.

661
00:38:58,136 --> 00:39:00,263
You're to respond only to Christie.

662
00:39:00,555 --> 00:39:01,764
Is that clear?

663
00:39:12,192 --> 00:39:14,235
That's a very fine Chardonnay
you're drinking.

664
00:39:15,195 --> 00:39:17,071
I want you to clean your vagina.

665
00:39:25,623 --> 00:39:26,624
No.

666
00:39:26,707 --> 00:39:28,125
From behind.

667
00:39:28,209 --> 00:39:29,502
Get on your knees.

668
00:39:29,793 --> 00:39:31,837
You have a very nice body.

669
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,227
Thank you. Send her up.

670
00:39:50,023 --> 00:39:52,609
Christie, get out and dry off,

671
00:39:53,068 --> 00:39:54,277
choose a robe,

672
00:39:54,528 --> 00:39:55,987
Not the Bijan,

673
00:39:56,071 --> 00:40:00,367
and come and meet me and our guest
in the living room for drinks.

674
00:40:07,374 --> 00:40:09,125
You've arrived! How lovely.

675
00:40:09,584 --> 00:40:11,002
Let me take your coat.

676
00:40:11,545 --> 00:40:12,712
I'm Paul.

677
00:40:12,796 --> 00:40:14,047
How good of you to come.

678
00:40:19,345 --> 00:40:21,013
Not quite blonde, are you?

679
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:23,307
More dirty blonde.

680
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,476
I'm gonna call you Sabrina.

681
00:40:26,602 --> 00:40:27,979
I'm Paul Allen.

682
00:40:46,582 --> 00:40:47,833
So...

683
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:51,336
don't you want to know what I do?

684
00:40:54,715 --> 00:40:56,049
No.

685
00:40:56,341 --> 00:40:57,926
No. Not really.

686
00:40:59,511 --> 00:41:01,013
Well,

687
00:41:01,096 --> 00:41:02,556
I work on Wall Street.

688
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,392
At Pierce & Pierce.

689
00:41:05,726 --> 00:41:07,019
Have you heard of it?

690
00:41:16,487 --> 00:41:18,948
You have a really nice place here, Paul.

691
00:41:19,991 --> 00:41:21,492
How much did you pay for it?

692
00:41:22,201 --> 00:41:23,620
Well, actually,

693
00:41:23,703 --> 00:41:25,830
that's none of your business, Christie.

694
00:41:26,664 --> 00:41:28,041
But I can assure you,

695
00:41:28,124 --> 00:41:29,375
it certainly wasn't cheap.

696
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:32,170
No. No smoking. Not in here.

697
00:41:35,049 --> 00:41:36,258
Varda truffle?

698
00:41:39,094 --> 00:41:41,305
I don't want you to get drunk, but

699
00:41:41,972 --> 00:41:43,974
that's a very fine Chardonnay

700
00:41:44,058 --> 00:41:45,476
you're not drinking.

701
00:41:53,275 --> 00:41:54,568
Do you like Phil Collins?

702
00:41:55,152 --> 00:41:56,987
I've been a big Genesis fan

703
00:41:57,071 --> 00:41:59,573
ever since the release
of their 1980 album,

704
00:42:00,449 --> 00:42:01,618
Duke.

705
00:42:02,035 --> 00:42:03,662
Before that,

706
00:42:03,745 --> 00:42:06,289
I really didn't understand
any of their work.

707
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:09,417
It was too artsy, too intellectual.

708
00:42:10,168 --> 00:42:12,003
It was on Duke where

709
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:15,465
Phil Collins' presence
became more apparent.

710
00:42:18,218 --> 00:42:19,844
I think invisible Touch

711
00:42:20,512 --> 00:42:22,722
is the group's undisputed masterpiece.

712
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,770
It's an epic meditation

713
00:42:27,853 --> 00:42:29,355
on intangibility.

714
00:42:32,525 --> 00:42:35,069
At the same time, it deepens and enriches

715
00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:37,780
the meaning of the preceding three albums.

716
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,366
Christie,

717
00:42:40,866 --> 00:42:42,159
take off the robe.

718
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:46,080
Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing

719
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:48,124
of Banks, Collins, and Rutherford.

720
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:52,461
You can practically hear every nuance
of every instrument.

721
00:42:53,797 --> 00:42:55,882
Sabrina, remove your dress.

722
00:42:56,758 --> 00:42:58,552
In terms of lyrical craftsmanship,

723
00:42:58,969 --> 00:43:00,554
sheer songwriting,

724
00:43:00,637 --> 00:43:02,931
this album hits a new peak
of professionalism.

725
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:06,101
Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?

726
00:43:07,477 --> 00:43:09,646
Take the lyrics to "Land Of Confusion."

727
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:13,358
In this song,
Phil Collins addresses the problems

728
00:43:13,442 --> 00:43:15,652
of abusive political authority.

729
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:22,034
"In Too Deep" is the most moving
pop song of the 1980s,

730
00:43:22,785 --> 00:43:25,121
about monogamy and commitment.

731
00:43:26,581 --> 00:43:28,624
The song is extremely uplifting.

732
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:30,543
Their lyrics are as positive

733
00:43:31,294 --> 00:43:32,795
and affirmative

734
00:43:32,879 --> 00:43:35,757
as anything I've heard in rock.

735
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:41,387
Christie,

736
00:43:41,471 --> 00:43:44,223
get down on your knees
so Sabrina can see your asshole.

737
00:43:45,642 --> 00:43:47,644
Phil Collins' solo career

738
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:50,063
seems to be more commercial,

739
00:43:50,606 --> 00:43:52,441
and therefore more satisfying

740
00:43:52,524 --> 00:43:54,151
in a narrower way.

741
00:43:54,401 --> 00:43:56,695
Especially songs like "In The Air Tonight"

742
00:43:56,779 --> 00:43:58,947
and "Against All Odds."

743
00:44:00,866 --> 00:44:03,035
Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it.

744
00:44:05,037 --> 00:44:07,998
But I also think Phil Collins works best

745
00:44:08,081 --> 00:44:11,961
within the confines
of the group than as a solo artist.

746
00:44:12,045 --> 00:44:14,714
And I stress the word "artist."

747
00:44:19,385 --> 00:44:21,012
This is "Sussudio."

748
00:44:21,095 --> 00:44:22,847
A great, great song.

749
00:44:23,223 --> 00:44:24,808
A personal favorite.

750
00:44:35,944 --> 00:44:37,195
Look at the camera.

751
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:18,029
Christie, look at the camera.

752
00:45:34,338 --> 00:45:35,882
Don't touch the watch.

753
00:45:58,238 --> 00:45:59,698
Can we go now?

754
00:46:00,407 --> 00:46:02,034
We're not through yet.

755
00:46:20,427 --> 00:46:22,888
If they have a good personality
and they're not great-looking,

756
00:46:22,971 --> 00:46:24,182
then who fuckin' cares?

757
00:46:24,265 --> 00:46:27,352
Just say, hypothetically, okay,
what if they have a good personality?

758
00:46:30,104 --> 00:46:31,397
I know, I know...

759
00:46:31,481 --> 00:46:33,775
There are no girls
with good personalities.

760
00:46:34,317 --> 00:46:36,945
A good personality consists of
a chick with a little hard body

761
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:40,782
who'll satisfy all sexual demands
without being too slutty about things,

762
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:42,909
and will essentially keep
her dumb fucking mouth shut.

763
00:46:42,992 --> 00:46:44,869
The only girls with good personalities

764
00:46:44,953 --> 00:46:46,412
who are smart, or maybe funny,

765
00:46:46,496 --> 00:46:48,247
or halfway intelligent or talented,

766
00:46:48,331 --> 00:46:50,167
though God knows what the fuck that means,

767
00:46:50,668 --> 00:46:52,211
- are ugly chicks.
- Absolutely.

768
00:46:52,294 --> 00:46:55,422
And this is because they have to make up
for how fucking unattractive they are.

769
00:46:55,506 --> 00:46:57,007
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?

770
00:46:57,091 --> 00:46:58,717
Ed Gein? Maître d' at Canal Bar?

771
00:46:58,801 --> 00:47:01,553
No. Serial killer. Wisconsin in the '50s.

772
00:47:01,637 --> 00:47:02,763
- And what did Ed say?
- He said,

773
00:47:02,846 --> 00:47:04,682
"When I see a pretty girl
walking down the street,

774
00:47:04,765 --> 00:47:05,849
I think two things.

775
00:47:05,933 --> 00:47:08,852
One part of me wants to take her out
and talk to her,

776
00:47:08,936 --> 00:47:11,355
be real nice and sweet
and treat her right."

777
00:47:11,438 --> 00:47:12,940
And what did the other part of him think?

778
00:47:13,399 --> 00:47:15,694
What her head would look like on a stick.

779
00:47:20,865 --> 00:47:22,117
Hi, guys.

780
00:47:22,909 --> 00:47:24,327
I want to get your opinion on something.

781
00:47:25,328 --> 00:47:26,913
It's my business card.

782
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:29,749
I decided to get a new one, too.

783
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:34,921
That's...

784
00:47:35,005 --> 00:47:36,297
Very nice, Luis.

785
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,093
Thank you.

786
00:47:54,233 --> 00:47:55,651
Listen, what about dinner?

787
00:47:55,735 --> 00:47:57,611
Is that all you ever have to contribute,
Van Patten?

788
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,988
"What about fucking dinner?"

789
00:47:59,071 --> 00:48:00,448
Cheer up there, Bateman.

790
00:48:00,531 --> 00:48:02,158
What's the matter,
no shiatsu this mornin'?

791
00:48:02,241 --> 00:48:04,201
Touch me again like that,
and you'll draw back a stump.

792
00:48:04,285 --> 00:48:06,287
- Hold on there, little buddy.
- Excuse me.

793
00:48:44,118 --> 00:48:46,079
God. Patrick.

794
00:48:46,996 --> 00:48:48,039
Why here?

795
00:48:48,122 --> 00:48:50,083
I've seen you looking at me.

796
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,293
I've noticed...

797
00:48:52,376 --> 00:48:53,878
your...

798
00:48:53,961 --> 00:48:55,463
hot body.

799
00:48:56,839 --> 00:48:58,257
Don't be shy.

800
00:48:58,966 --> 00:49:01,136
You can't imagine how long
I've wanted this,

801
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,597
ever since that Christmas party
at Arizona 206.

802
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,723
You know the one.

803
00:49:04,807 --> 00:49:07,226
You were wearing that red-striped
paisley Armani tie.

804
00:49:10,562 --> 00:49:12,022
I want you.

805
00:49:12,606 --> 00:49:14,233
I want you, too.

806
00:49:15,109 --> 00:49:16,693
- Patrick!
- What is it?

807
00:49:18,195 --> 00:49:19,863
Where are you going?

808
00:49:20,447 --> 00:49:22,324
I've gotta return some videotapes.

809
00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:31,209
Patrick!

810
00:49:56,443 --> 00:49:58,529
Okay, Monday? The 20th.

811
00:49:58,612 --> 00:50:00,156
Monday? That's...

812
00:50:00,489 --> 00:50:02,199
- Any Paul Allen?
- Reservation... no.

813
00:50:02,283 --> 00:50:04,076
- No reservation, but...
- Kimball.

814
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,328
I've been wanting to talk with you.
Come into my office.

815
00:50:06,412 --> 00:50:08,372
Jean, great jacket. Matsuda?

816
00:50:08,664 --> 00:50:11,750
Do you remember where you were
the night of Paul's disappearance?

817
00:50:12,418 --> 00:50:14,420
Which was on the 20th of December?

818
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,046
God.

819
00:50:16,505 --> 00:50:19,049
I guess I was probably
returning videotapes.

820
00:50:23,096 --> 00:50:25,015
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.

821
00:50:25,098 --> 00:50:26,641
That's not what I've got.

822
00:50:26,725 --> 00:50:27,767
What?

823
00:50:27,851 --> 00:50:29,811
That's not the information I've received.

824
00:50:30,729 --> 00:50:32,105
Well, I... Wait.

825
00:50:32,439 --> 00:50:33,773
What information have you received?

826
00:50:33,857 --> 00:50:35,025
Let me see.

827
00:50:38,737 --> 00:50:40,447
- You were with...
- Well, I could be wrong.

828
00:50:41,615 --> 00:50:43,825
When was the last time
you were with Paul Allen?

829
00:50:43,909 --> 00:50:47,246
We'd gone to a new musical called

830
00:50:48,331 --> 00:50:50,208
Oh, Africa, Brave Africa.

831
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:51,417
It was a laugh riot.

832
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,211
That was about it.

833
00:50:53,294 --> 00:50:54,879
I think we had dinner at Orso's.

834
00:50:54,962 --> 00:50:56,714
No, Petal... No, Orso's.

835
00:50:56,964 --> 00:50:59,967
I hope I've been informative.
Long day. Bit scattered.

836
00:51:00,051 --> 00:51:01,552
I'm a little spent now, too.

837
00:51:02,261 --> 00:51:03,429
But...

838
00:51:03,512 --> 00:51:05,431
how about lunch in a week or so?

839
00:51:05,806 --> 00:51:07,558
When I've sorted out all this information.

840
00:51:07,642 --> 00:51:09,143
Great. Yes, I'd like that.

841
00:51:09,227 --> 00:51:12,564
And if you could try and pin down
where you were

842
00:51:12,856 --> 00:51:16,526
the night of Paul Allen's disappearance,
it would make my job a lot easier.

843
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,403
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.

844
00:51:23,325 --> 00:51:24,534
Huey Lewis And The News.

845
00:51:27,162 --> 00:51:28,455
Great stuff.

846
00:51:28,538 --> 00:51:30,499
I just bought it on my way here.
You heard it?

847
00:51:31,667 --> 00:51:32,918
Never.

848
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:35,504
I mean, I don't really like singers.

849
00:51:35,587 --> 00:51:37,214
Not a big music fan, huh?

850
00:51:37,714 --> 00:51:39,092
No, I like music.

851
00:51:39,175 --> 00:51:40,677
Just, they're...

852
00:51:42,178 --> 00:51:43,513
Huey's too black-sounding for me.

853
00:51:44,555 --> 00:51:45,807
To each his own.

854
00:51:48,017 --> 00:51:49,269
So...

855
00:51:49,352 --> 00:51:50,603
Lunch next week?

856
00:51:50,687 --> 00:51:51,813
I'll be there.

857
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,560
Will you call me before Easter?

858
00:52:30,394 --> 00:52:31,604
Maybe.

859
00:52:36,026 --> 00:52:37,235
What are you doing tonight?

860
00:52:37,569 --> 00:52:40,030
Dinner at River Café.

861
00:52:40,322 --> 00:52:41,698
Au Bar afterwards, maybe.

862
00:52:41,781 --> 00:52:43,116
That's nice.

863
00:52:45,201 --> 00:52:46,328
I never knew you smoked.

864
00:52:48,121 --> 00:52:49,205
You never noticed.

865
00:52:53,251 --> 00:52:54,627
Listen,

866
00:52:54,711 --> 00:52:55,754
Patrick...

867
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,049
can we talk?

868
00:53:03,637 --> 00:53:05,264
You look

869
00:53:05,514 --> 00:53:06,724
marvelous.

870
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:09,560
There's nothin' to say.

871
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:11,395
You're gonna marry Luis.

872
00:53:11,896 --> 00:53:13,356
Isn't that special.

873
00:53:15,649 --> 00:53:16,650
Patrick...

874
00:53:21,906 --> 00:53:23,325
Yes, Courtney?

875
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,372
If I don't see you before Easter,

876
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,916
have a nice one, okay?

877
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,047
You, too.

878
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:45,680
Patrick?

879
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,474
Yeah?

880
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:50,645
Nothing.

881
00:54:21,385 --> 00:54:24,263
There's this theory now that
if you can catch the AIDS virus

882
00:54:24,346 --> 00:54:27,015
through having sex with someone,
then you can catch anything.

883
00:54:27,891 --> 00:54:30,310
Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy,

884
00:54:30,394 --> 00:54:33,856
hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia.

885
00:54:33,939 --> 00:54:36,316
I'm not sure,
but I don't think dyslexia's a virus.

886
00:54:37,192 --> 00:54:39,027
Who knows? They don't know that.

887
00:54:39,486 --> 00:54:40,571
Prove it.

888
00:54:52,792 --> 00:54:54,294
- Oh, God!
- What?

889
00:54:54,377 --> 00:54:56,337
There's a fucking milligram of sweetener.

890
00:54:56,671 --> 00:54:59,674
I wanna get high off this, Bateman,
not sprinkle it on my fucking oatmeal.

891
00:54:59,924 --> 00:55:02,886
It's definitely weak, but I have a feeling
if we do enough of it, we'll be okay.

892
00:55:02,969 --> 00:55:05,555
Can you keep it down?
I'm trying to do drugs.

893
00:55:06,306 --> 00:55:07,348
Fuck you!

894
00:55:07,432 --> 00:55:09,059
Calm down. Do it anyway.

895
00:55:10,019 --> 00:55:11,103
That's right.

896
00:55:11,187 --> 00:55:13,522
That is, if the fag in
the next stall thinks it's okay!

897
00:55:13,606 --> 00:55:15,024
- Fuck you!
- Hey, fuck you!

898
00:55:17,318 --> 00:55:19,111
Sorry, dude. Steroids.

899
00:55:20,237 --> 00:55:21,322
Okay, let's do it.

900
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:44,513
Where did Craig go?

901
00:55:45,013 --> 00:55:46,848
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs.

902
00:55:47,307 --> 00:55:50,018
McDermott went to sign a peace treaty
between the United States and Russia.

903
00:55:50,101 --> 00:55:51,978
He's the one behind glasnost, you know.

904
00:55:52,729 --> 00:55:54,981
He said he was in
mergers and acquisitions.

905
00:55:55,065 --> 00:55:56,900
You're not confused, are you?

906
00:55:57,526 --> 00:55:58,944
No, not really.

907
00:55:59,027 --> 00:56:00,863
Gorbachev is not downstairs.

908
00:56:01,364 --> 00:56:03,824
Karen's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs.

909
00:56:03,908 --> 00:56:04,951
He's at Tunnel.

910
00:56:05,034 --> 00:56:06,327
Ask me a question.

911
00:56:07,745 --> 00:56:09,330
So, what do you do?

912
00:56:09,914 --> 00:56:11,249
I'm into

913
00:56:11,332 --> 00:56:13,459
murders and executions, mostly.

914
00:56:13,543 --> 00:56:14,794
Do you like it?

915
00:56:14,877 --> 00:56:16,170
Well, it depends.

916
00:56:16,546 --> 00:56:17,380
Why?

917
00:56:17,463 --> 00:56:21,217
Well, most guys I know who work
in mergers and acquisitions

918
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,802
really don't like it.

919
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,721
So...

920
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,809
where do you work out?

921
00:56:31,895 --> 00:56:33,730
You think I'm dumb, don't you?

922
00:56:33,814 --> 00:56:34,815
What?

923
00:56:34,898 --> 00:56:37,109
You think I'm dumb.
You think all models are dumb.

924
00:56:37,192 --> 00:56:38,193
No.

925
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:40,028
I really don't.

926
00:56:40,112 --> 00:56:41,863
That's okay. I don't mind.

927
00:56:43,198 --> 00:56:44,950
There's something sweet about you.

928
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,354
Doin' the crossword?

929
00:57:18,359 --> 00:57:19,527
You need any help?

930
00:57:30,873 --> 00:57:31,749
Jean?

931
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:33,584
Yes, Patrick?

932
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:35,878
Would you like to accompany me to dinner?

933
00:57:36,754 --> 00:57:37,880
That is,

934
00:57:38,339 --> 00:57:39,923
if you're not doing anything.

935
00:57:41,008 --> 00:57:42,760
No. No, I don't have any plans.

936
00:57:44,887 --> 00:57:46,056
Well...

937
00:57:49,184 --> 00:57:50,602
isn't this a coincidence.

938
00:57:50,977 --> 00:57:52,312
Listen, where should we go?

939
00:57:52,395 --> 00:57:53,605
Anywhere you want.

940
00:57:53,938 --> 00:57:55,440
Let's not think about what I want.

941
00:57:55,523 --> 00:57:56,650
How about anywhere you want?

942
00:57:58,902 --> 00:58:01,154
I don't know, Patrick.
I can't make this decision.

943
00:58:01,237 --> 00:58:02,489
Come on.

944
00:58:03,323 --> 00:58:05,116
Where do you want to go?

945
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,409
Anywhere you want.

946
00:58:06,493 --> 00:58:08,787
Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.

947
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,414
What about...

948
00:58:21,258 --> 00:58:22,093
Dorsia?

949
00:58:28,182 --> 00:58:29,058
So.

950
00:58:30,851 --> 00:58:33,145
Dorsia is where Jean wants to go.

951
00:58:34,063 --> 00:58:35,022
I don't know.

952
00:58:35,106 --> 00:58:36,816
No, we'll go wherever you want to go.

953
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:38,527
Dorsia is fine.

954
00:58:45,909 --> 00:58:47,285
Dorsia. Yes?

955
00:58:47,494 --> 00:58:50,247
Yeah, can you take two tonight
at, let's say, 9:00?

956
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:51,581
We're totally booked.

957
00:58:51,665 --> 00:58:53,500
Really? That's great.

958
00:58:53,583 --> 00:58:55,711
No, I said we are totally booked.

959
00:58:55,794 --> 00:58:57,170
Two at 9:00? Perfect.

960
00:58:57,254 --> 00:58:58,505
See you then.

961
00:59:02,259 --> 00:59:03,510
Yeah?

962
00:59:04,302 --> 00:59:05,596
You're...

963
00:59:06,764 --> 00:59:07,890
dressed okay.

964
00:59:09,225 --> 00:59:10,601
You didn't give a name.

965
00:59:10,852 --> 00:59:12,186
They know me.

966
00:59:13,187 --> 00:59:15,273
Why don't you meet me at my place?

967
00:59:15,356 --> 00:59:17,650
At 7:00. For drinks.

968
00:59:19,485 --> 00:59:20,695
And, Jean?

969
00:59:21,696 --> 00:59:23,573
We'll want to change before we go out.

970
00:59:32,332 --> 00:59:34,042
Patrick, it's so elegant.

971
00:59:34,626 --> 00:59:36,128
What a wonderful view.

972
00:59:36,545 --> 00:59:37,546
Jean...

973
00:59:38,922 --> 00:59:40,048
Sorbet?

974
00:59:42,468 --> 00:59:44,052
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.

975
00:59:50,434 --> 00:59:51,977
Do you want a bite?

976
00:59:52,186 --> 00:59:54,021
I'm on a diet. But thank you.

977
00:59:54,396 --> 00:59:55,773
You don't need to lose any weight.

978
00:59:55,856 --> 00:59:57,358
You're kidding, right?

979
00:59:57,942 --> 01:00:00,111
You look great. Very fit.

980
01:00:01,571 --> 01:00:02,822
You can always be thinner,

981
01:00:03,531 --> 01:00:04,532
look better.

982
01:00:04,866 --> 01:00:06,785
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner.

983
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:08,953
I don't want to ruin your willpower.

984
01:00:09,037 --> 01:00:10,121
No, it's all right.

985
01:00:11,748 --> 01:00:13,958
I'm not very good
at controlling it anyway.

986
01:00:17,962 --> 01:00:19,047
So, listen...

987
01:00:19,964 --> 01:00:22,509
What do you really want
to do with your life?

988
01:00:23,301 --> 01:00:25,346
Just briefly. Summarize. And

989
01:00:25,429 --> 01:00:28,015
don't tell me you enjoy
working with children, okay?

990
01:00:28,349 --> 01:00:29,350
Well,

991
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:31,352
I'd like to travel and

992
01:00:31,435 --> 01:00:33,354
maybe go back to school, but

993
01:00:33,938 --> 01:00:35,397
I don't really know.

994
01:00:35,773 --> 01:00:38,526
I'm at a point in my life
where there seems to be

995
01:00:38,609 --> 01:00:40,277
so many possibilities.

996
01:00:41,153 --> 01:00:43,280
But I don't know. I'm just so unsure.

997
01:00:47,284 --> 01:00:48,410
Do you have a boyfriend?

998
01:00:50,163 --> 01:00:51,414
No, not really.

999
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:53,166
Interesting.

1000
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:55,001
Are you seeing anyone?

1001
01:00:55,919 --> 01:00:57,671
I mean, seriously?

1002
01:00:58,171 --> 01:00:59,214
Maybe.

1003
01:00:59,965 --> 01:01:01,091
I don't know.

1004
01:01:02,008 --> 01:01:03,260
Not really.

1005
01:01:06,221 --> 01:01:07,305
Jean?

1006
01:01:08,348 --> 01:01:10,433
Do you feel fulfilled?

1007
01:01:10,809 --> 01:01:13,144
I mean, in your life?

1008
01:01:13,728 --> 01:01:15,063
I guess I do.

1009
01:01:15,146 --> 01:01:17,441
For a long time,
I was too focused on my work.

1010
01:01:17,525 --> 01:01:20,736
But now I've really begun
to think about changing myself.

1011
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:24,615
You know, developing and growing.

1012
01:01:24,866 --> 01:01:25,867
Growing.

1013
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,869
I'm glad you said that.

1014
01:01:31,831 --> 01:01:33,416
Did you know that

1015
01:01:33,499 --> 01:01:35,251
Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie,

1016
01:01:35,334 --> 01:01:36,961
was named Lassie?

1017
01:01:37,795 --> 01:01:38,880
Had you heard this?

1018
01:01:39,922 --> 01:01:40,923
Who's Ted Bundy?

1019
01:01:43,051 --> 01:01:44,344
Forget it.

1020
01:01:47,431 --> 01:01:48,265
What's that?

1021
01:01:48,348 --> 01:01:49,349
Duct tape.

1022
01:01:49,683 --> 01:01:50,934
I need it for...

1023
01:01:52,394 --> 01:01:53,395
taping something.

1024
01:01:58,442 --> 01:01:59,484
Patrick?

1025
01:02:01,069 --> 01:02:02,779
Have you ever wanted to

1026
01:02:03,155 --> 01:02:04,406
make someone happy?

1027
01:02:04,489 --> 01:02:06,450
What? No! Put it in the carton!

1028
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:10,038
Sorry.

1029
01:02:12,165 --> 01:02:13,207
Jean?

1030
01:02:14,751 --> 01:02:15,835
What?

1031
01:02:18,254 --> 01:02:19,464
Make someone happy.

1032
01:02:20,757 --> 01:02:21,883
Have you ever wanted to?

1033
01:02:25,595 --> 01:02:27,263
I'm looking for...

1034
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:34,730
I guess you could say I just want
to have a meaningful relationship

1035
01:02:34,813 --> 01:02:36,357
with someone special.

1036
01:02:46,617 --> 01:02:48,243
Patrick. Patrick.

1037
01:02:48,327 --> 01:02:49,703
I know you're there.

1038
01:02:50,037 --> 01:02:51,789
Pick up the phone, you bad boy.

1039
01:02:52,373 --> 01:02:53,874
What are you up to tonight?

1040
01:02:53,958 --> 01:02:55,751
It's me. Don't try to hide.

1041
01:02:56,418 --> 01:02:58,712
I hope you're not out there
with some little number you picked up,

1042
01:02:58,796 --> 01:03:00,589
because you're mine, Mr. Bateman.

1043
01:03:00,673 --> 01:03:02,342
My boy next door.

1044
01:03:03,468 --> 01:03:05,887
Anyway you never called me,
and you said you would.

1045
01:03:05,971 --> 01:03:08,515
And I'll leave a message for Jean
about this, too, to remind you,

1046
01:03:08,598 --> 01:03:10,767
but we're having dinner
with Melania and Taylor.

1047
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:13,311
You know Melania. She went to Sweet Briar.

1048
01:03:13,395 --> 01:03:15,647
And we're meeting at the Cornell Club,

1049
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:17,399
so I'll call you tomorrow morning, honey.

1050
01:03:17,482 --> 01:03:19,192
Sorry. I know you hate that.

1051
01:03:20,151 --> 01:03:23,154
Bye, Patrick. Bye, Mr. Big Time CEO.

1052
01:03:23,238 --> 01:03:24,364
Bye-bye.

1053
01:03:28,995 --> 01:03:30,329
Was that Evelyn?

1054
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:36,377
Are you still seeing her?

1055
01:03:41,173 --> 01:03:43,801
I'm sorry. I have no right to ask that.

1056
01:03:49,348 --> 01:03:50,349
Do you want me to go?

1057
01:03:51,851 --> 01:03:52,935
Yeah.

1058
01:03:55,939 --> 01:03:58,442
I don't think I can control myself.

1059
01:04:01,319 --> 01:04:02,612
I know I should go.

1060
01:04:02,696 --> 01:04:05,240
I know I have a tendency to get involved
with unavailable men.

1061
01:04:08,368 --> 01:04:09,536
I mean...

1062
01:04:11,496 --> 01:04:12,706
Do you want me to go?

1063
01:04:15,042 --> 01:04:16,668
I think if you stay,

1064
01:04:17,461 --> 01:04:19,087
something bad will happen.

1065
01:04:21,841 --> 01:04:23,426
I think I might hurt you.

1066
01:04:24,761 --> 01:04:26,721
You don't want to get hurt, do you?

1067
01:04:26,971 --> 01:04:28,931
No. No, I guess not.

1068
01:04:30,808 --> 01:04:32,226
I don't want to get bruised.

1069
01:04:35,521 --> 01:04:36,564
You're right.

1070
01:04:37,398 --> 01:04:38,566
I should go.

1071
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:46,658
Don't forget you have
a lunch date tomorrow

1072
01:04:46,742 --> 01:04:48,702
with Donald Kimball
at Smith and Wollensky's.

1073
01:04:49,953 --> 01:04:50,996
Thanks.

1074
01:04:52,539 --> 01:04:54,041
It slipped my mind completely.

1075
01:05:13,812 --> 01:05:14,854
So.

1076
01:05:16,231 --> 01:05:17,774
The night he disappeared.

1077
01:05:17,857 --> 01:05:20,819
Any new thoughts about what you did?

1078
01:05:22,695 --> 01:05:23,822
Not sure.

1079
01:05:24,364 --> 01:05:25,824
I had a shower,

1080
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,201
and some sorbet.

1081
01:05:28,284 --> 01:05:30,328
I think you're getting
your dates mixed up.

1082
01:05:30,411 --> 01:05:31,621
But how?

1083
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:33,748
Where do you place

1084
01:05:34,249 --> 01:05:35,458
Paul that night?

1085
01:05:35,542 --> 01:05:38,838
According to his datebook,
and this was verified by his secretary,

1086
01:05:38,921 --> 01:05:41,006
he had dinner with Marcus Halberstram.

1087
01:05:42,258 --> 01:05:43,926
- And?
- I questioned him.

1088
01:05:44,802 --> 01:05:46,929
- Marcus?
- Yes, and he denies it.

1089
01:05:47,012 --> 01:05:48,722
Though, at first, he couldn't be sure.

1090
01:05:49,515 --> 01:05:51,058
- But he denied it.
- Yes.

1091
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:54,937
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?

1092
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:56,397
Yes.

1093
01:05:56,939 --> 01:05:58,399
He does? You're sure?

1094
01:05:58,691 --> 01:06:00,609
I've checked it out. It's clean.

1095
01:06:04,655 --> 01:06:05,657
Now...

1096
01:06:06,533 --> 01:06:07,534
where were you?

1097
01:06:09,077 --> 01:06:10,328
Where was Marcus?

1098
01:06:10,579 --> 01:06:12,455
He wasn't with Paul Allen.

1099
01:06:12,539 --> 01:06:13,790
Who was he with?

1100
01:06:13,874 --> 01:06:16,168
He was at Atlantis

1101
01:06:16,418 --> 01:06:18,503
with Craig McDermott,

1102
01:06:18,587 --> 01:06:19,754
Frederick Dibble,

1103
01:06:19,838 --> 01:06:21,840
Harry Newman, George Butner, and...

1104
01:06:23,091 --> 01:06:24,092
you.

1105
01:06:28,221 --> 01:06:30,223
Right, yeah. Of course.

1106
01:06:31,475 --> 01:06:33,561
We had wanted Paul Allen to come,

1107
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:35,897
but he had made plans,

1108
01:06:36,689 --> 01:06:40,651
and I guess I had dinner with Victoria
the following night.

1109
01:06:40,735 --> 01:06:43,154
Personally, I think the guy
went a little nutso.

1110
01:06:43,237 --> 01:06:45,615
Split town for a while.
Maybe he did go to London,

1111
01:06:45,698 --> 01:06:47,366
sightseeing, drinking, whatever.

1112
01:06:47,617 --> 01:06:49,952
Anyway, I'm pretty sure
he'll turn up sooner or later.

1113
01:06:50,828 --> 01:06:53,915
I mean, to think that one of
his friends killed him

1114
01:06:53,998 --> 01:06:56,459
for no reason whatsoever
would be too ridiculous.

1115
01:06:57,794 --> 01:06:59,254
Isn't that right, Patrick?

1116
01:07:21,485 --> 01:07:23,070
Christie, Christie.

1117
01:07:23,362 --> 01:07:24,864
I'm not so sure about this.

1118
01:07:24,948 --> 01:07:27,200
I had to go to emergency after last time.

1119
01:07:27,283 --> 01:07:29,160
This won't be anything like last time.

1120
01:07:29,244 --> 01:07:31,246
- I promise.
- I don't think so.

1121
01:07:32,997 --> 01:07:35,333
Just come in the limo
and talk to me for a minute.

1122
01:07:36,417 --> 01:07:38,336
Driver's here. You're safe.

1123
01:07:57,022 --> 01:07:59,149
Nothing like last time. I promise.

1124
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,651
All right.

1125
01:08:01,527 --> 01:08:03,612
So you're looking great.

1126
01:08:03,696 --> 01:08:04,989
How've you been?

1127
01:08:05,072 --> 01:08:07,866
Well, I actually might need
a little surgery after last time.

1128
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:08,951
Really?

1129
01:08:09,034 --> 01:08:11,245
My friend told me I should maybe
even get a lawyer.

1130
01:08:12,913 --> 01:08:14,915
Lawyers are so complicated.

1131
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:17,168
Don't do that.

1132
01:08:18,128 --> 01:08:19,587
Here's a check.

1133
01:09:09,598 --> 01:09:11,516
Half now, half later.

1134
01:09:16,813 --> 01:09:18,148
Okay.

1135
01:09:18,482 --> 01:09:20,192
Your name's Christie.

1136
01:09:20,776 --> 01:09:23,111
We're meeting a friend of mine, Elizabeth.

1137
01:09:23,612 --> 01:09:26,490
She'll be joining us
in my new apartment shortly.

1138
01:09:28,075 --> 01:09:29,576
You'll like her.

1139
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:31,620
She's a very nice girl.

1140
01:09:38,127 --> 01:09:39,837
You look really familiar.

1141
01:09:39,921 --> 01:09:41,297
Did you go to Dalton?

1142
01:09:43,257 --> 01:09:45,301
I think I met you at
the Surf Bar, didn't I?

1143
01:09:45,385 --> 01:09:46,344
With Spicey?

1144
01:09:46,427 --> 01:09:48,471
Well, maybe not with Spicey,
but definitely at Surf Bar.

1145
01:09:48,554 --> 01:09:49,639
You know, Surf Bar?

1146
01:09:49,722 --> 01:09:51,682
Anyway, Surf Bar sucks now. It's terrible.

1147
01:09:51,766 --> 01:09:53,893
Went to a birthday party there
for Malcolm Forbes.

1148
01:09:53,976 --> 01:09:55,395
Oh, my God, please.

1149
01:09:57,105 --> 01:09:59,357
This is nicer than your other apartment.

1150
01:10:01,985 --> 01:10:03,779
Well, it's not that nice.

1151
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:10,119
Where did you two meet?

1152
01:10:10,202 --> 01:10:12,496
Oh, God. We met at...

1153
01:10:13,038 --> 01:10:15,999
Oh, God, at the Kentucky Derby
in '85 or '86.

1154
01:10:16,959 --> 01:10:19,086
You were hanging out
with that bimbo Allison Poole.

1155
01:10:19,169 --> 01:10:20,379
Hot number.

1156
01:10:20,462 --> 01:10:21,547
What do you mean?

1157
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:22,589
She was a hot number.

1158
01:10:22,673 --> 01:10:24,466
Get a platinum card,
she'd give you a blow job.

1159
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:26,427
Listen, this girl worked
at a tanning salon.

1160
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:27,344
Need I say more?

1161
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:28,721
What do you do?

1162
01:10:29,973 --> 01:10:31,641
She's my

1163
01:10:32,392 --> 01:10:33,309
cousin.

1164
01:10:35,478 --> 01:10:36,604
She's from

1165
01:10:37,147 --> 01:10:37,981
France.

1166
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:41,151
Where's your phone?
I've gotta call Harley.

1167
01:10:46,614 --> 01:10:48,575
Where do you summer? Southampton?

1168
01:10:49,576 --> 01:10:50,785
No.

1169
01:10:50,869 --> 01:10:52,829
Oh, God. It's his machine.

1170
01:10:52,912 --> 01:10:54,748
Elizabeth, it's 3:00 in the morning.

1171
01:10:54,832 --> 01:10:57,001
He's a goddamn drug dealer.
These are his peak hours.

1172
01:10:57,251 --> 01:10:59,170
- Don't tell him you're here.
- Why would I?

1173
01:10:59,462 --> 01:11:01,172
This tastes weird.

1174
01:11:01,255 --> 01:11:03,174
Harley, it's me. I need your services.

1175
01:11:03,257 --> 01:11:05,009
Translate that however you want.

1176
01:11:05,551 --> 01:11:07,011
I'm at...

1177
01:11:08,846 --> 01:11:10,681
- You're at Paul Allen's.
- Who?

1178
01:11:10,764 --> 01:11:13,350
- Paul Allen.
- I want the number, idiot.

1179
01:11:13,434 --> 01:11:15,769
Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's,
and I'll try you again later.

1180
01:11:15,853 --> 01:11:17,438
If I don't see you at
Canal Bar tomorrow night,

1181
01:11:17,521 --> 01:11:18,814
I'll sic my hair dresser on you.

1182
01:11:19,815 --> 01:11:21,568
Did you know that guy who disappeared?

1183
01:11:21,818 --> 01:11:24,446
Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce?
Was he a friend of yours?

1184
01:11:24,529 --> 01:11:25,697
No.

1185
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:27,741
Do you have any coke?

1186
01:11:28,241 --> 01:11:30,243
Or Halcion? I would take a Halcion.

1187
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:32,329
Listen.

1188
01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:36,124
I would just like to see

1189
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:37,667
the two of you

1190
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:39,002
get it on.

1191
01:11:41,129 --> 01:11:42,172
What's wrong with that?

1192
01:11:42,255 --> 01:11:43,590
It's totally disease-free.

1193
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:47,637
Patrick, you're a lunatic.

1194
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,055
Come on.

1195
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:51,265
Don't you find Christie attractive?

1196
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:53,476
Let's not get lewd.

1197
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:55,686
I'm in no mood for a lewd conversation.

1198
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:57,021
Come on.

1199
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,607
I think it'd be a turn-on.

1200
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:01,609
Does he do this all the time?

1201
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,656
Christie, you're not drinking your wine.

1202
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:10,910
You're telling me you've never
gotten it on with a girl?

1203
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,538
No.

1204
01:12:12,621 --> 01:12:14,081
I'm not a lesbian.

1205
01:12:14,164 --> 01:12:15,874
Why would you think I would be into that?

1206
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:19,169
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence,
for one thing.

1207
01:12:19,253 --> 01:12:21,463
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick.

1208
01:12:22,047 --> 01:12:23,632
You're making me feel weird.

1209
01:12:28,887 --> 01:12:30,597
Did you know

1210
01:12:30,931 --> 01:12:33,308
that Whitney Houston's debut LP,

1211
01:12:34,059 --> 01:12:36,645
called simply Whitney Houston,

1212
01:12:37,563 --> 01:12:39,691
had four number-one singles on it?

1213
01:12:41,526 --> 01:12:43,152
Did you know that, Christie?

1214
01:12:43,695 --> 01:12:45,947
You actually listen to Whitney Houston?

1215
01:12:47,073 --> 01:12:49,242
You own a Whitney Houston CD?

1216
01:12:51,202 --> 01:12:52,745
More than one?

1217
01:12:54,664 --> 01:12:57,500
It's hard to choose a favorite
among so many great tracks.

1218
01:13:00,336 --> 01:13:01,921
But "The Greatest Love Of All"

1219
01:13:02,422 --> 01:13:05,926
is one of the best,
most powerful songs ever written

1220
01:13:07,428 --> 01:13:10,472
about self-preservation, dignity.

1221
01:13:11,223 --> 01:13:15,019
Its universal message
crosses all boundaries

1222
01:13:15,269 --> 01:13:17,980
and instills one with the hope

1223
01:13:18,939 --> 01:13:22,234
that it's not too late
to better ourselves.

1224
01:13:23,652 --> 01:13:26,155
Since, Elizabeth,

1225
01:13:26,947 --> 01:13:29,867
it's impossible, in this world we live in,

1226
01:13:30,492 --> 01:13:32,120
to empathize with others,

1227
01:13:32,746 --> 01:13:34,664
we can always empathize with ourselves.

1228
01:13:35,874 --> 01:13:37,542
It's an important message.

1229
01:13:38,668 --> 01:13:40,128
Crucial, really.

1230
01:13:42,964 --> 01:13:45,175
And it's beautifully stated on the album.

1231
01:14:57,333 --> 01:14:58,960
Not the face, you bitch!

1232
01:14:59,043 --> 01:15:01,754
Not the fuckin' face,
you piece of bitch trash!

1233
01:16:30,971 --> 01:16:32,556
I want a firm commitment.

1234
01:16:33,599 --> 01:16:35,560
I think, Evelyn,

1235
01:16:35,644 --> 01:16:37,479
that we've lost touch.

1236
01:16:37,771 --> 01:16:39,147
Why? What's wrong?

1237
01:16:42,651 --> 01:16:44,945
My need to engage in homicidal behavior

1238
01:16:45,028 --> 01:16:47,864
on a massive scale cannot be corrected,

1239
01:16:47,948 --> 01:16:50,116
but I have no other way
to fulfill my needs.

1240
01:16:52,327 --> 01:16:53,703
We need to talk.

1241
01:16:54,162 --> 01:16:55,247
Talk about what, Patrick?

1242
01:16:55,330 --> 01:16:57,332
It's over, Evelyn.

1243
01:16:57,415 --> 01:16:59,042
It's all over.

1244
01:17:00,252 --> 01:17:01,587
Touchy, touchy.

1245
01:17:01,671 --> 01:17:03,339
I'm sorry I brought up the wedding.

1246
01:17:03,422 --> 01:17:05,132
Let's just avoid the issue, all right?

1247
01:17:05,675 --> 01:17:07,176
Now, are we having coffee?

1248
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:09,971
I'm fucking serious.
It's fucking over. Us.

1249
01:17:10,054 --> 01:17:11,597
This is no joke.

1250
01:17:12,765 --> 01:17:14,809
I don't think we should see
each other anymore.

1251
01:17:15,268 --> 01:17:17,353
But your friends are my friends,

1252
01:17:17,645 --> 01:17:19,355
and my friends are your friends.

1253
01:17:20,189 --> 01:17:21,816
I really don't think it would work.

1254
01:17:22,316 --> 01:17:23,442
You have a little something...

1255
01:17:23,526 --> 01:17:26,279
I know that your friends are my friends,

1256
01:17:26,362 --> 01:17:28,448
and I've thought about that.

1257
01:17:29,408 --> 01:17:30,659
You can have them.

1258
01:17:31,994 --> 01:17:33,787
You're really serious, aren't you?

1259
01:17:33,871 --> 01:17:35,205
Yes, I am.

1260
01:17:38,709 --> 01:17:40,335
What about the past?

1261
01:17:40,878 --> 01:17:42,963
- Our past?
- We never really shared one.

1262
01:17:43,714 --> 01:17:47,050
- You're inhuman.
- No, I'm in touch with humanity.

1263
01:17:48,343 --> 01:17:50,053
Evelyn, I'm sorry.

1264
01:17:50,137 --> 01:17:51,263
I just...

1265
01:17:53,348 --> 01:17:54,934
You're not terribly important to me.

1266
01:17:55,476 --> 01:17:56,978
Oh, no.

1267
01:17:57,395 --> 01:17:59,355
No, no.

1268
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:04,652
I know my behavior can be
erratic sometimes.

1269
01:18:05,862 --> 01:18:07,238
What do you want me to do?

1270
01:18:07,864 --> 01:18:09,032
What is it that you want?

1271
01:18:09,115 --> 01:18:12,452
If you really want to do something for me,
then stop making this scene right now.

1272
01:18:12,535 --> 01:18:15,705
- Oh, God, I can't believe this.
- I'm leaving.

1273
01:18:15,788 --> 01:18:18,082
I've assessed the situation,
and I'm going.

1274
01:18:18,708 --> 01:18:19,792
Where are you going?

1275
01:18:19,876 --> 01:18:21,503
Just leaving.

1276
01:18:21,754 --> 01:18:22,713
But where?

1277
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:26,383
I have to return some videotapes.

1278
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:58,541
Here, kitty, kitty.

1279
01:19:15,935 --> 01:19:17,853
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

1280
01:19:18,479 --> 01:19:19,480
Stop that.

1281
01:20:01,898 --> 01:20:03,900
Drop the weapon! Drop it now!

1282
01:20:04,317 --> 01:20:05,820
Get on the ground! Put...

1283
01:20:49,448 --> 01:20:51,325
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith?

1284
01:20:51,658 --> 01:20:53,535
Hey, now don't forget to sign in.

1285
01:22:23,671 --> 01:22:26,340
Harold, it's Bateman, Patrick Bateman.

1286
01:22:27,341 --> 01:22:28,843
You're my lawyer,
so I think you should know

1287
01:22:28,926 --> 01:22:30,136
I've killed a lot of people.

1288
01:22:30,219 --> 01:22:33,181
Some escort girls in the apartment uptown,

1289
01:22:34,265 --> 01:22:36,684
some homeless people, maybe five or ten,

1290
01:22:36,767 --> 01:22:38,561
an NYU girl I met in Central Park.

1291
01:22:38,644 --> 01:22:40,813
I left her in a parking lot
behind some doughnut shop.

1292
01:22:40,897 --> 01:22:43,442
I killed Bethany,
my old girlfriend, with a nail gun,

1293
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:45,944
and some man,

1294
01:22:46,028 --> 01:22:47,863
some faggot with a dog.

1295
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:51,742
Last week, I killed another girl

1296
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:54,119
with a chain saw.

1297
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:58,207
I had to.

1298
01:22:58,290 --> 01:23:00,125
She almost got away,

1299
01:23:00,209 --> 01:23:02,044
and...

1300
01:23:02,127 --> 01:23:04,546
Someone else there. I can't remember.

1301
01:23:04,630 --> 01:23:05,881
Maybe a model.

1302
01:23:06,423 --> 01:23:07,674
She's dead, too,

1303
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:09,886
and Paul Allen.

1304
01:23:10,428 --> 01:23:13,890
I killed Paul Allen
with an ax in the face.

1305
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:17,518
His body is dissolving
in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen.

1306
01:23:18,728 --> 01:23:20,480
I don't want to leave anything out here.

1307
01:23:20,563 --> 01:23:23,066
I guess I've killed maybe 20 people,

1308
01:23:23,358 --> 01:23:24,901
maybe 40.

1309
01:23:27,111 --> 01:23:29,197
I have tapes of a lot of it.

1310
01:23:30,198 --> 01:23:32,116
Some of the girls have seen the tapes.

1311
01:23:32,659 --> 01:23:34,118
I even...

1312
01:23:42,336 --> 01:23:44,004
I ate some of their brains...

1313
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:47,758
and I tried to cook a little.

1314
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:52,888
Tonight I...

1315
01:23:54,265 --> 01:23:57,935
I just had to kill a lot of people,

1316
01:23:58,519 --> 01:24:00,062
and...

1317
01:24:03,775 --> 01:24:04,985
I'm not sure

1318
01:24:05,944 --> 01:24:08,947
I'm gonna get away with it this time.

1319
01:24:11,783 --> 01:24:13,285
So, I mean...

1320
01:24:16,538 --> 01:24:17,872
I guess...

1321
01:24:18,498 --> 01:24:20,041
I'm a pretty...

1322
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:24,170
I mean, I guess I'm a pretty sick guy.

1323
01:24:26,548 --> 01:24:27,925
So...

1324
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:30,720
if you get back tomorrow,

1325
01:24:32,513 --> 01:24:34,265
I may show up at Harry's Bar.

1326
01:24:34,682 --> 01:24:36,017
So, you know.

1327
01:24:37,768 --> 01:24:39,729
Keep your eyes open.

1328
01:26:59,415 --> 01:27:01,125
Are you my 2:00?

1329
01:27:02,001 --> 01:27:03,210
No.

1330
01:27:04,879 --> 01:27:05,881
Can I help you?

1331
01:27:07,090 --> 01:27:08,675
I'm looking for...

1332
01:27:09,676 --> 01:27:11,386
Paul Allen's place.

1333
01:27:12,137 --> 01:27:14,097
Doesn't he live here?

1334
01:27:14,347 --> 01:27:15,724
No, he doesn't.

1335
01:27:16,558 --> 01:27:17,851
You sure?

1336
01:27:19,269 --> 01:27:21,146
You saw the ad in the Times?

1337
01:27:21,229 --> 01:27:22,439
No.

1338
01:27:22,772 --> 01:27:24,524
Yeah. I mean, yeah.

1339
01:27:25,275 --> 01:27:26,526
In the Times.

1340
01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:28,153
There was no ad in the Times.

1341
01:27:29,488 --> 01:27:31,114
I think you should go now.

1342
01:27:31,782 --> 01:27:33,075
But I think...

1343
01:27:36,037 --> 01:27:37,455
I want to know what happened here.

1344
01:27:37,538 --> 01:27:39,999
Don't make any trouble, please.

1345
01:27:40,875 --> 01:27:42,418
I suggest you go.

1346
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:56,933
Don't come back.

1347
01:27:57,225 --> 01:27:58,435
I won't.

1348
01:27:59,269 --> 01:28:00,562
Don't worry.

1349
01:28:31,553 --> 01:28:32,720
Patrick Bateman's office.

1350
01:28:32,804 --> 01:28:34,097
Jean?

1351
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:36,349
- I need help.
- Patrick, is that you?

1352
01:28:37,475 --> 01:28:38,726
Jean, I'm not...

1353
01:28:39,978 --> 01:28:41,354
Craig McDermott called.

1354
01:28:41,437 --> 01:28:44,566
Wants to meet you, David Van Patten
and Tim Bryce at Harry's for drinks.

1355
01:28:44,816 --> 01:28:46,109
Oh, God.

1356
01:28:46,192 --> 01:28:48,236
What did you say, you dumb bitch?

1357
01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:50,364
Patrick, I can't hear you.

1358
01:28:50,447 --> 01:28:52,074
What am I doing?

1359
01:28:52,741 --> 01:28:54,535
Where are you, Patrick? What's wrong?

1360
01:28:56,287 --> 01:28:58,872
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean,

1361
01:29:00,499 --> 01:29:02,835
to the office this afternoon.

1362
01:29:03,335 --> 01:29:04,545
Why?

1363
01:29:05,379 --> 01:29:07,464
Just say no!

1364
01:29:08,716 --> 01:29:10,175
What is it, Patrick? Are you all right?

1365
01:29:10,634 --> 01:29:13,929
Stop sounding so fucking sad!

1366
01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:16,015
Jesus!

1367
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:34,930
Table for three.

1368
01:30:35,013 --> 01:30:37,433
Bateman, you look a little wild-eyed.
Rough day at the office?

1369
01:30:38,309 --> 01:30:40,812
Hey, look, Bryce is back,
and he's drinking mineral water.

1370
01:30:40,895 --> 01:30:44,273
He's a changed man except he still can't
get a reservation to save his life.

1371
01:30:44,857 --> 01:30:46,526
Why don't you just try 150 Wooster?

1372
01:30:47,151 --> 01:30:49,779
I'm not going anywhere
unless we have a reservation.

1373
01:30:50,113 --> 01:30:52,990
Le Cirque, Flamingo East, Oyster Bar.

1374
01:30:53,074 --> 01:30:54,492
Come on, faggots, let's get a res.

1375
01:30:54,575 --> 01:30:55,910
Keep your shirt on.

1376
01:30:55,993 --> 01:30:57,412
Maybe lose the suspenders.

1377
01:30:58,329 --> 01:30:59,997
Need a reservation for 8:30.

1378
01:31:00,081 --> 01:31:01,332
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1379
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,168
Right back.

1380
01:31:03,252 --> 01:31:05,045
10:00 would not be any good, no.

1381
01:31:05,129 --> 01:31:06,463
Just fucking call them.

1382
01:31:06,547 --> 01:31:08,465
- Give me the phone. I'll do it.
- I'll call ya back.

1383
01:31:08,549 --> 01:31:10,342
Face it. The Japanese will
own most of this country

1384
01:31:10,426 --> 01:31:13,262
- by the end of the '90s.
- Shut up, Carnes.

1385
01:31:13,345 --> 01:31:14,680
They will not.

1386
01:31:16,557 --> 01:31:18,142
So, Harold,

1387
01:31:19,435 --> 01:31:20,602
did you get my message?

1388
01:31:21,311 --> 01:31:23,272
Jesus, yes. That was hilarious.

1389
01:31:23,355 --> 01:31:24,314
That was you, wasn't it?

1390
01:31:24,398 --> 01:31:25,733
Yeah, naturally.

1391
01:31:25,816 --> 01:31:27,609
Bateman killing Allen
and the escort girls.

1392
01:31:27,693 --> 01:31:29,237
That's fabulous. That's rich.

1393
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:30,488
What exactly do you mean?

1394
01:31:30,572 --> 01:31:31,865
The message you left.

1395
01:31:31,948 --> 01:31:33,616
By the way, Davis, how's Cynthia?

1396
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:34,909
You're still seeing her, right?

1397
01:31:34,993 --> 01:31:36,828
Wait, Harold. What do you mean?

1398
01:31:36,911 --> 01:31:38,538
Excuse me. Nothing.

1399
01:31:38,621 --> 01:31:40,039
It's good to see you.

1400
01:31:40,707 --> 01:31:42,000
Is that Edward Towers?

1401
01:31:45,211 --> 01:31:46,463
Davis.

1402
01:31:47,505 --> 01:31:49,466
I'm not one to badmouth anyone.

1403
01:31:49,966 --> 01:31:50,967
Your joke was amusing,

1404
01:31:51,050 --> 01:31:52,510
but come on, man.

1405
01:31:52,594 --> 01:31:54,263
You had one fatal flaw.

1406
01:31:55,473 --> 01:31:57,224
Bateman is such a dork.

1407
01:31:57,933 --> 01:32:00,603
Such a boring, spineless lightweight.

1408
01:32:00,936 --> 01:32:03,189
Now if you said Bryce or McDermott...

1409
01:32:03,731 --> 01:32:05,149
Otherwise, it was amusing.

1410
01:32:05,232 --> 01:32:07,276
Now if you'll excuse me,
I really must be going.

1411
01:32:07,359 --> 01:32:08,778
Wait.

1412
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:11,113
Stop.

1413
01:32:12,573 --> 01:32:14,033
I did it, Carnes.

1414
01:32:15,659 --> 01:32:16,911
I killed him.

1415
01:32:16,994 --> 01:32:19,330
I'm Patrick Bateman.

1416
01:32:22,876 --> 01:32:24,878
I chopped Allen's fucking head off.

1417
01:32:26,296 --> 01:32:30,133
The whole message I left
on your machine was true.

1418
01:32:31,301 --> 01:32:32,552
Excuse me.

1419
01:32:32,969 --> 01:32:34,304
I really must be going now.

1420
01:32:35,055 --> 01:32:36,431
No, listen.

1421
01:32:37,682 --> 01:32:39,351
Don't you know who I am?

1422
01:32:40,018 --> 01:32:41,436
I'm not Davis.

1423
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:42,979
I'm Patrick Bateman.

1424
01:32:45,816 --> 01:32:47,652
We talk on the phone all the time.

1425
01:32:49,278 --> 01:32:50,863
Don't you recognize me?

1426
01:32:52,949 --> 01:32:54,492
You're my lawyer.

1427
01:32:56,369 --> 01:32:57,829
Now, Carnes...

1428
01:32:58,871 --> 01:33:00,122
listen.

1429
01:33:00,623 --> 01:33:02,250
Listen very, very carefully.

1430
01:33:06,587 --> 01:33:08,381
I killed Paul Allen...

1431
01:33:10,550 --> 01:33:12,009
and I liked it.

1432
01:33:12,970 --> 01:33:15,055
I can't make myself any clearer.

1433
01:33:16,056 --> 01:33:17,724
But that's simply not possible.

1434
01:33:18,559 --> 01:33:19,977
And I don't find this funny anymore.

1435
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:22,104
It never was supposed to be.

1436
01:33:22,521 --> 01:33:24,398
- Why isn't it possible?
- It's just not.

1437
01:33:24,481 --> 01:33:27,192
Why not, you stupid bastard?

1438
01:33:28,277 --> 01:33:31,113
Because I had dinner with
Paul Allen twice in London,

1439
01:33:32,322 --> 01:33:34,032
- just ten days ago.
- No, you...

1440
01:33:37,911 --> 01:33:38,996
didn't.

1441
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:40,582
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1442
01:34:21,874 --> 01:34:24,251
We've seen the results of that mistrust

1443
01:34:24,335 --> 01:34:27,046
in the form of lies, divisions,
and mistakes.

1444
01:34:27,588 --> 01:34:29,965
We need to find a way to cooperate

1445
01:34:30,049 --> 01:34:32,135
while realizing foreign policy

1446
01:34:32,218 --> 01:34:34,095
can't be run by committee.

1447
01:34:34,888 --> 01:34:37,390
And I believe there's now
the growing sense

1448
01:34:37,474 --> 01:34:40,685
that we can accomplish
more by cooperating.

1449
01:34:41,603 --> 01:34:42,854
And, in the end,

1450
01:34:42,938 --> 01:34:45,815
this may be the eventual
blessing in disguise

1451
01:34:45,899 --> 01:34:47,442
to come out of the Iran-Contra mess.

1452
01:34:47,525 --> 01:34:49,277
How can he lie like that?

1453
01:34:51,321 --> 01:34:53,198
- How can he pull that shit?
- What shit?

1454
01:34:53,281 --> 01:34:55,158
Now where do we have reservations at?

1455
01:34:55,784 --> 01:34:58,454
I mean, I'm not really hungry, but
I'd like to have reservations someplace.

1456
01:34:58,537 --> 01:35:00,289
How can you be so fucking...

1457
01:35:01,582 --> 01:35:02,875
I don't know...

1458
01:35:02,959 --> 01:35:04,001
cool about it?

1459
01:35:04,085 --> 01:35:06,170
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.

1460
01:35:12,343 --> 01:35:13,678
Bateman.

1461
01:35:14,762 --> 01:35:16,263
What are you so fucking zany about?

1462
01:35:16,347 --> 01:35:18,641
I'm just a happy camper.

1463
01:35:19,850 --> 01:35:21,102
Rockin' and a-rollin'!

1464
01:35:23,145 --> 01:35:24,481
Oh, brother! Look,

1465
01:35:24,564 --> 01:35:27,985
he presents himself
as this harmless old codger, but

1466
01:35:28,485 --> 01:35:29,569
inside...

1467
01:35:29,653 --> 01:35:31,238
But inside...

1468
01:35:32,447 --> 01:35:34,324
But inside doesn't matter.

1469
01:35:35,575 --> 01:35:37,452
Inside? Yes? Inside?

1470
01:35:37,536 --> 01:35:39,621
Believe it or not, Bryce,
we're actually listening to you.

1471
01:35:39,705 --> 01:35:41,289
Come on, Bateman,

1472
01:35:41,373 --> 01:35:42,416
what do you think?

1473
01:35:45,293 --> 01:35:46,586
Whatever.

1474
01:35:46,670 --> 01:35:49,047
Whose moronic idea was it
to order dry beers?

1475
01:35:50,173 --> 01:35:51,676
I need a scotch.

1476
01:36:07,817 --> 01:36:09,777
There are no more barriers to cross.

1477
01:36:10,903 --> 01:36:14,532
All I have in common
with the uncontrollable and the insane,

1478
01:36:14,615 --> 01:36:16,577
the vicious and the evil,

1479
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:20,289
all the mayhem I have caused
and my utter indifference toward it,

1480
01:36:20,372 --> 01:36:22,249
I have now surpassed.

1481
01:36:25,711 --> 01:36:28,005
My pain is constant and sharp,

1482
01:36:28,505 --> 01:36:31,216
and I do not hope
for a better world for anyone.

1483
01:36:32,468 --> 01:36:36,013
In fact, I want my pain
to be inflicted on others.

1484
01:36:37,056 --> 01:36:38,891
I want no one to escape.

1485
01:36:41,351 --> 01:36:43,354
But even after admitting this,

1486
01:36:43,730 --> 01:36:45,356
there is no catharsis.

1487
01:36:45,982 --> 01:36:48,401
My punishment continues to elude me,

1488
01:36:48,818 --> 01:36:51,279
and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself.

1489
01:36:52,113 --> 01:36:55,200
No new knowledge can be
extracted from my telling.

1490
01:36:55,950 --> 01:36:59,370
This confession has meant nothing.
