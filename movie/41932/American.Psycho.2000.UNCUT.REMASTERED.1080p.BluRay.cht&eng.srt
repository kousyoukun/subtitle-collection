00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:28,410
- 天哪 我討厭這地方 這是小娘們的餐廳 - 幹嗎不去朵西亞?
- God, I hate this place. It's a chick's restaurant. - Why aren't we at Dorsia ?

9
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,490
因為巴特曼和那兒的領班鬧彆扭
Because Bateman won't give the maitre d' head.

10
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,580
那邊的是裏德·羅賓遜嗎?
Is that Reed Robinson over there?

11
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,710
- 你是不是藥嗑多了? 那才不是羅賓遜呢 - 那麼是誰?
- Are you freebasing or what? That's not Robinson. - Well, who is it then?

12
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,750
- 是保羅·艾倫 - 不是吧
- It's Paul Allen. - That's not Paul Allen.

13
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,210
保羅·艾倫在屋子的另外一頭

這兒連嗑藥的好點的洗手間都沒有
They don't have a good bathroom to do coke in.

16
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,180

- Lucky Jew bastard. - Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with anything?

19

我看到那傢伙在他辦公室裏
I've seen that bastard sitting in his office...

20
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,440
一面和總裁通電話 一面玩在轉他媽的燭台
talking on the phone to the C.E.O.s, spinnin' a fuckin' menorah.

21
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,990
不是燭台 他們轉的是陀螺
Not a menorah. You spin a dreidel.

22
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,990
哦 天哪 巴特曼

Do you want me to fry you up some fucking potato pancakes ? Some latkes ?

24
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,830
不 只是...少說兩句反猶太的話吧
No, just... cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.

25
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,040
哦 我忘了 巴特曼在和美國公民自由協會的人約會呢
Oh, I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from the A.C.L.U.

26
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,000
他是理智的代言人 一個隔壁男孩
He's the voice of reason. The boy next door.

27
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,550
談到理智... 只要570塊
Speaking of reasonable... Only $570.

28
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,590
還不錯嘛
That's not bad.

29
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,720
稍微掏了點腰包
A little something for the purse.

30
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,720
給她50塊小費
Give her the 50.

31
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,360
" I used to think that the day would never come "

32
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,300
" I'd see the light the shade of the morning sun "

33
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,550
" My morning sun is the drug that brings me here "

34
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,450
" To the child lost replaced by fear "

35
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,450
" I used to think that the day would never come "

36
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,490
" That my life would begin to "

37
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,760
來杯"斯特利巖"
Stoli on the rocks.

38
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,180
這不能用了 這是付現金的酒吧
These aren't good anymore. It's a cash bar.

39
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,560
25塊錢
That'll be $25.

40
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,770
你他們的臭婊子
You're a fucking ugly bitch.

41
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,480
我要把你捅了
I wanna stab you to death...

42
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,110
再玩你的血
and play around with your blood.

43
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,000
兩位要什麼?
What can I get for you two ?

44
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,820
我住在在西81街
I live in the American Gardens building...

45
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,400
美國公園大廈十一樓
on West 81st Street on the 11th floor.

46
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,620
我叫帕特裏克·巴特曼
My name is Patrick Bateman.

47
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,620
現年27歲
I'm 27 years old.

48
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,000
我信奉自我養生
I believe in taking care of myself,

49
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,000
定量進餐 大量運動
in a balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine.

50
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,460
每天早晨 如果我的臉皮有點松
In the morning, if my face is a little puffy,

51
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,630
我會在做俯臥撐的時候上上冰袋
I'll put on an icepack while doing my stomach crunches.

52
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,630
我現在能做一千下了
I can do a thousand now.

53
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,200
除下冰袋後 我要用深層毛孔清潔露
After I remove the icepack, I use a deep pore cleanser lotion.

54
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,530
在沖澡的時候 我會上一種水洗凝膠清潔劑
In the shower, I use a water-activated gel cleanser.

55
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,160
然後是蜜煉杏仁磨砂沐浴露
Then a honey-almond body scrub.

56
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,000
再在臉上用去角質磨砂膠
And on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub.

57
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,010
接著我會做個薄荷草藥面膜
Then I apply an herb mint facial masque,

58
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,100
在等待的10分鐘里 我會為其他的日常程序做準備工作
which leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine.

59
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,690
我總上用不含或只含少量酒精的刮面後香露
I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol,

60
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,570
因為酒精會讓你的面部乾燥 看起來更老
because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older.

61
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,610
然後是潤膚露
Then moisturizer,

62
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,660
然後是抗衰老眼霜
then an anti-aging eye balm,

63
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,240
最後是潤潤護膚露
followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.

64
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:44,910
帕特裏克·巴特曼是一個意象
There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman.

65
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,130
很抽像 但並非真正的我
Some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me.

66
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,130
只是那麼一個意象... 非常模糊
Only an entity... something illusory.

67
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,760
並且儘管我可以掩藏冷酷
And though I can hide my cold gaze...

68
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,010
你與我握手仍感覺到我有血有肉
and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours...

69
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:02,890
而且你甚至會感到 我們的生活方式頗為相似
and may be you can even sense our life styles are probably comparable,

70
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,270
但我其實並非真我
I simply am not there.

71
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,880
" Ow "

72
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,290
" Mmm, yeah "

73
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,190
" I said, baby I just want you back "

74
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,920
" And I want you to stay "

75
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,230
" And I want you to stay "

76
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,730
早安
Good morning.

77
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,600
早安 漢密爾頓
Good morning, Hamilton. Nice tan.

78
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,300
" Whoa I'm walking on sunshine "

79
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,240
" Whoa "

80
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,220
來晚了 有氧操班有課 對不起 有人找嗎?
Late. Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages ?

81
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,810
瑞斯基·哈里森的約會取消了 他沒說他取消的是什麼約會及其原因
Ricky Harrison has to cancel. He didn't say what he was cancelling or why.

82
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:50,270
我有時候會約瑞斯基在哈佛俱樂部打拳 還有呢?
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else ?

83
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,570
- 斯賓塞約你在17號碼頭的福路戴斯喝酒 - 什麼時候?
- Spencer wants to meet for drinks at Fluties, Pier 17. - When ?

84
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,690
- 6點以後 我該怎麼答覆? - 不行 推掉
- After 6:00. And what should I say ? - Negative. Cancel it.

85
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,610
- 就說"不行" - 就說"不行"?
- Just say "no" - Just say "no" ?

86
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,410
好了 吉恩
Okay, Jean.

" She's a craze you'd endorse She's a powerful force "

107
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,250
" You're obliged to conform when there's no other course "

108

- I don't want to talk about it. - I hate that job anyway.

121
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,770
我不明白你幹嗎還在那兒幹

因為我幾乎肯定我們定不到好位子了
since I'm positive we won't have a decent table.

128
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,260
可是我們居然訂到了 這讓我長出了一口氣
But we do, and relief washes over me in an awesome wave.

129
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,600
帕特裏克 這是我侄女范登和她男朋友斯達什
Patrick, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash.

130
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,930
- 他們都是搞藝術的 - 菜單是用盲文寫的
- They're both artists. - The menu's in Braille.

131
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,560
- 我想你每個人都見過了 - 你美極了
- I see you've met everyone. - You look awful.

132
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,900
好的 好了
Okay. All right.

133
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,030
我差不多可以確定
I'm fairly certain that...

134
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,530
蒂莫西 布瑞斯和伊芙琳有私情
Timothy Bryce and Evelyn are having an affair.

135
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,450
蒂莫西是我認識的人裏面唯一一個有趣的人物
Timothy is the only interesting person I know.

136
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:51,990
我也根本不在乎伊芙琳知不知道
I'm almost completely indifferent as to whether Evelyn knows...

137
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,120
我和她最好的朋友庫特妮·羅林森也有私情
I'm having an affair with Courtney Rawlinson, her closest friend.

138
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,170
庫坦妮的相貌近乎完美
Courtney is almost perfect looking.

139
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,800
她通常都在用一或幾種迷幻藥
She's usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs.

140
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,300
今晚我想是香奈克斯 嗯 哦
Tonight, I believe, it's Xanax. Mmm. Oh.

141
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,510
比她嗑藥更煩人的是
More disturbing than her drug use, though, is the fact that she's engaged...

142
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,140
她和路易斯 卡魯法 本行最大的蠢材定了婚
to Luis Carruthers, the biggest doofus in the business.

143
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,480
告訴我 斯達什
Tell me, Stash.

144
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,100
你覺得休南區是不是變得太...商業化了?
Do you think Soho is becoming too... commercial ?

145
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,480
- 是的 我感覺到了 - 哦 誰說的屁話
- Yes. I read that. - Oh, who gives a rat's ass ?

146
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,530
嘿 那會影響到我們的
Hey, that affects us.

147
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,570
好吧 那斯里蘭卡的大屠殺呢? 對我們也有影響嗎?
Well, what about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey ? Doesn't that affect us too ?

148
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,570
你對斯里蘭卡瞭解多少?
Do you know anything about Sri Lanka ?

149
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,740
多少 比如說 錫克教徒在那裏 殺了成千上萬的以色列人
How, like, the Sikhs are killing tons of Israelis over there ?

150
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,830
得了 布瑞斯
Come on, Bryce.

151
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,210
比斯里蘭卡更嚴重的問題多得很呢
There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about.

152
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,880
- 比如? - 我們得廢除種族隔離制度 這是一樁
- Like what ? - Well, we have to end apartheid, for one,

153
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:46,300
減緩核軍備競賽 終結恐怖主義和世界饑荒
slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger.

154
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,180
我們要為無家可歸者提供食物和住所
We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless...

155
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,520
還有反對種族歧視和提高人權
and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights,

156
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,390
同時還要提高婦女平等權利
while also promoting equal rights for women.

157
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,850
我們要推動傳統道德價值
We have to encourage a return...

158
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,560
的回歸
to traditional moral values.

159
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,030
最重要的
Most importantly,

160
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,410
我們要提高全面社會責任感
we have to promote general social concern...

161
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,370
並且讓年輕人不再那麼唯利是圖
and less materialism in young people.

162
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:17,200
帕特裏克 多麼鼓舞人心的思想啊
Patrick, how thought provoking.

163
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,580
你好
Hello.

164
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,370
你好
Hello.

165
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,060
漂白? 你是要說"漂白"嗎?
Bleaching ? Are you trying to say "bleaching" ?

166
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,060
哦 上帝啊 有兩件事
Oh, my God. Two things.

167
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,060
第一: 切瑞蒂的東西不是想漂白就能漂白的 根本不可能
One: You can't bleach a Cerruti. Out of the question.

168
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,070
第二: 這床單只能在聖達菲才買得到
Two: I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe.

169
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,110
這些床單價值不菲 我一定要把它們洗乾淨
These are very expensive sheets, and I really need them cleaned.

170
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,700
太太 你要是再不閉上你的臭嘴 我就殺了你
Lady, if you don't shut your fucking mouth, I will kill you.

171
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,320
現在 聽好
Now, listen.

172
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,950
我再過20分鐘就要和羅納德 哈里森 在休伯特餐廳開個午餐會了
I have a lunch meeting at Hubert's in 20 minutes with Ronald Harrison.

173
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,950
我希望床單能在今天下午前洗乾淨
I need those sheets cleaned by this afternoon.

174
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,370
聽著 我聽不懂你的話! 真見鬼! 你這個笨蛋
Listen, I can't understand you ! This is crazy ! You're a fool.

175
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,420
我和你這種愚蠢的"娘們兒"沒法談!
I can't cope with this stupid "bitchee" !

176
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,000
- 懂了嗎? 天哪 - 帕特裏克?
- Understand ? Christ. - Patrick ?

177
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,550
嗨 帕特裏克
Hi, Patrick.

178
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,760
- 我猜就是你 - 你好 那個...
- I thought that was you. - Hello. This is...

179
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,180
不是很可笑嗎 大老遠跑來? 這確實是最好的洗衣店了
Isn't it ridiculous, coming all the way up here ? They really are the best.

180
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,260
那麼他們怎麼洗不掉這些污跡?
Then why can't they get these stains out ?

181
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,770
我是說 你能和他們談談嗎? 我跟他們一點說不通
I mean, can you talk to these people or something ? I'm not getting anywhere.

182
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,810
- 哦 這是什麼呀? - 唔 這是...
- Oh, what are those ? - Well, it's...

183
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,070
- 酸果蔓汁 - 真的嗎?
- Cranberry juice. Cranapple. - Really ?

184
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,900
聽著 如果你能幫我跟他們說說 我真的很感謝
Listen, if you could talk to them, I would really appreciate it.

185
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,070
太晚了 再過15分鐘我在休伯特餐廳有個約會
I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in 15 minutes.

186
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,450
- 休伯特餐廳? 不是搬到市區了嗎? - 哦 天哪
- Hubert's ? That moved uptown, right ? - Oh, boy.

187
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,780
聽著 我得走了 謝謝你 維多利亞
Listen, I've gotta go. Thank you, Victoria.

188
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,830
也許下星期哪一天我們一起吃頓午飯
Maybe we could do lunch one day next week.

189
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:24,500
- 我常來市區的 星期六怎麼樣? - 我成天都在工作 恐怕不行
- I'm downtown quite often. What about a Saturday ? - I'm at work all the time.

190
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,170
- 下週六呢? - 沒問題
- Next Saturday ? Can't, - I'm afraid. Sure.

191
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,420
萊斯·密斯女子合唱隊日場表演見 聽著我真的必須走了
At a matinee of LesMis. Listen, I really gotta go.

192
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:34,340
- 哦 天哪 我會給你打電話的 - 好的 幹吧
- Oh, Christ. I'll call you. - Okay. Do.

193
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,430
聽著 你在和劉易斯約會 他從亞利桑那州來
Listen, you're dating Lewis, he's in Arizona.

194
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,430
你在耍我 我們根本沒有這種安排
You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans.

195
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,350
你今晚會吃什麼藥?
What could you possibly be up to tonight ?

196
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,270
- 別說了 我... - 吃一大把鋰劑?
- Stop it. I'm... - On a lot of lithium ?

197
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,650
在等路易斯的電話 他說今晚要給我打的
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight.

198
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,320
蕩婦? 蕩婦 你在和一個混蛋約會
Pumpkin ? Pumpkin, you're dating an asshole.

199
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,190
- 嗯哼 - 蕩婦 你在和紐約最沒用的臭小子約會
- Mm-hmm. - Pumpkin, you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.

200
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,410
蕩婦 你在和一個歪七倒八的臭小子約會
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.

201
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,580
帕特裏克 別再叫我蕩婦了 好嗎?
Patrick, stop calling me pumpkin, okay ?

202
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,040
- 我得掛了 - 考特妮?
- I have to go. - Courtney ?

203
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,040
- 嗯? - 去吃飯
- Hmm ? - Dinner.

204
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,670
- 不行 - 我說去朵西亞
- I can't. - I'm thinking Dorsia.

205
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,090
- 朵西亞還不錯 - 打扮得漂亮點
- Dorsia's nice. - Wear something fabulous.

206
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,180
哦 耶!
Oh, yeah!

207
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,900
這是朵西亞
Dorsia.

208
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,650
嗯 我知道有點晚了
Um, yes, I know it's a little late,

209
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:36,360
但還有可能訂到兩個8點到8點半的位子嗎?
but is it possible to reserve a table for two at 8:00 or 8:30, perhaps ?

210
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:57,010
在伊莉莎白雅頓做一下臉 真的很舒服
...a facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing.

211
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,260
然後去波特瑞·巴恩
And then, to the Pottery Barn,

212
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,680
在那兒我買到了...
where I got this little...

213
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,140
- 這個小銀鬆餅盒 - 那是唐納德 特朗普的車嗎?
- silver muffin dish. - Is that Donald Trump's car ?

214
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,230
上帝啊 帕特裏克 別作聲
God, Patrick. Shut up.

215
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:12,060
你知道嗎 考特妮 你應該再吃點鋰劑 或者喝杯可樂
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium or have a Diet Coke.

216
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:15,030
咖啡因或許能幫你擺脫現在的疲塌
Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.

217
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,820
我只想要一個孩子
I just want a child.

218
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,490
兩個
Just two...

219
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,120
完美無暇的
perfect...

220
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,540
孩子
children.

221
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,250
- 我們到了嗎? - 是的
- Are we here ? - Yeah.

222
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,220
- 這兒是朵西亞嗎? - 是的 親愛的
- This is Dorsia ? - Yes, dear.

223
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,010
考特妮 你馬上就會嘗到花生醬湯
Courtney, you're gonna have the peanut butter soup...

224
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,680
熏鴨和南瓜泥
with smoked duck and mashed squash.

225
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:52,650
紐約午場把這個叫 "好玩又神秘的小菜"
New York Matinee called it "a playful but mysterious little dish."

226
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,570
你會喜歡的 接下來是紫羅蘭和松子襯底的紅鯛魚
You'll love it. And then the red snapper with violets and pine nuts.

227
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,570
我想這樣的搭配很合適
I think that'll follow nicely.

228
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,450
謝謝 帕特裏克
Mmm. Thanks, Patrick.

229
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,500
帕特裏克 多謝你照看考特妮
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney.

230
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,420
朵西亞 真讓人難忘
Dorsia. How impressive.

231
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,710
你到底怎麼在這兒訂到位的?
How on Earth did you get a reservation there ?

232
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,050
運氣吧 我想
Lucky, I guess.

233
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,090
這西裝棒極了
That's a wonderful suit.

234
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,470
別告訴我 別講 讓我猜
Don't tell me. Don't tell me. Let me guess.

235
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,600
唔 是華倫天奴嗎?
Mmm, Valentino Couture ?

236
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,770
- 嗯哼 - 唔
- Uh-huh. - Hmm.

237
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,940
- 看起來料子真軟 - 君子動口不動手 路易斯
- It looks so soft. - Your compliment was sufficient, Luis.

238
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:38,860
你好 海博斯坦姆 好炫的領帶 你還好嗎?
Hello, Halberstram. Nice tie. How the hell are you ?

239
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,240
艾倫把我誤認成那個蠢貨馬克斯 海博斯坦姆了
Allen has mistaken me for this dickhead, Marcus Halberstram.

240
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,910
因為馬克斯也在P&P工作 這倒也合理
It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&P,

241
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,450
而且他幹的活和我一模一樣
and in fact does the same exact thing I do.

242
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,500
他也愛穿華倫天奴西服 戴奧利弗人眼鏡
He also has a penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses.

243
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,500
馬克斯和我去的理髮店都是一家
Marcus and I even go to the same barber,

244
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,790
而我的髮型比他稍微好那麼一點
although I have a slightly better haircut.

245
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,210
- 蘭塞姆那單生意怎麼樣了? - 嗯 一切正常
- How's the Ransom account going, Marcus ? - It's, uh, all right.

246
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,630
是嗎? 有趣 你沒說好極了
Really ? That's interesting. It's not, uh, not great.

247
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:04,390
- 哦 嗯 你知道的 - 那麼 塞西莉亞呢?
- Oh, well, you know. - So, how's Cecilia ?

248
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,140
- 她是個好姑娘 - 哦 沒錯 我很幸運
- She's a great girl. - Oh, yeah. I'm very lucky.

249
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,310
- 嗯 - 嘿 艾倫 恭喜你在做費希爾那單生意
- Mm-hmm. - Hey, Allen, congratulations on the Fisher account.

250
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,850
- 謝謝 百特 - 聽著 我叫保羅 笨蛋
- Thank you, Baxter. - Listen, Paul. Squash.

251

給我打電話 星期五怎麼樣?
Call me. How about Friday ?

252
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,700
不行啊 我8點半在朵西亞訂了位
No can do. I got an 8:30 res at Dorsia.

253
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,240
美味的海膽酸橘汁醃魚
Great sea urchin ceviche.

254
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,330
朵西亞星期五的位子? 他怎麼搶到的?
Dorsia on Friday night ? How'd he swing that ?

255
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,110
我想他在吹牛
I think he's lying.

256
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,910
- 什麼東西? - 新名片

- Good coloring. - That's bone.

261
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,180
用了一種叫司麗安-瑞爾的字體
And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.

262
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,720
很酷 巴特曼 但算不了啥 看這個
It's very cool, Bateman, but that's nothing. Look at this.

Nice.

266
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,650
天哪 真是蓋了 你這種傻瓜蛋怎麼變得這麼有品位了?
Jesus. That is really super. How a nitwit like you get so tasteful?

267
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,240
我不敢相信布瑞斯...
I can't believe that Bryce...

268
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,240
居然認為范·派頓的名片比我的好
prefers Van Patten's card to mine.

269
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,200
但是別急 你們還沒看到好的呢
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.

270
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:27,540
瑞斯德字體 淡色光暈... 白底

277
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,580
有什麼不妥嗎 帕特裏克?
Is something wrong, Patrick ?

278
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,620
你出了好多汗
You're sweating.

279
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,740
你好 我是帕特·巴特曼

283
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,710
是啊 還凍壞了 是不是?
Yeah. Cold out too, isn't it ?

284
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,840
幹嗎不找份活幹? 你這麼餓 幹嗎不找份活幹?
Why don't you get a job ? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job ?

285
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,880
我失業了
I lost my job.

286
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,930
為什麼? 你酗酒嗎?
Why ? You drinking ?

287
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:04,680
你就是為此丟了飯碗的嗎? 還是做了什麼內部交易?
Is that why you lost it ? Insider trading ?

288
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,980
開玩笑而已
Just joking.

289

292
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,690
你消極處事 就是這個拖了你的後腿
You got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you.

293
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:21,320
你必須努力振作 我會幫你的

我凍壞了 也餓極了
I'm so cold, I'm hungry.

298
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,300
你知道你有多臭嗎?
You know how bad you smell ?

299
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,470
你像堆臭狗屎 你知道嗎?
You reek of shit. Do you know that ?

300
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,970
真抱歉 是因為...
I'm sorry. It's just that...

301
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,970
我也不知道
I don't know.

302
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,600
我和你根本不是一路人
I don't have anything in common with you.

303
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,490
哦 哦 謝謝你 先生 謝謝你
Oh. Oh, thank you, mister. Thank you.

304
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,700
我凍懷了
I'm cold out here.

305
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,700
- 你知道你是怎麼樣的一個窩囊廢嗎? - 什麼?
- You know what a fucking loser you are ? - What ?

306
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,020
你的皮膚真好 巴特曼先生
What beautiful skin you have, Mr. Bateman.

307
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,360
那麼細膩 光滑
So fine, so smooth.

308
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,410
我具有人類的一切特徵...
I have all the characteristics of a human being...

309
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:53,080
髮膚血肉
flesh, blood, skin, hair...

310
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,380
但沒有一個清晰可辨的表情
but not a single, clear, identifiable emotion,

311
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,880
除了貪婪和厭惡
except for greed and disgust.

312
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,590
我內心深處發生了可怕的變化
Something horrible is happening inside of me,

313
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,590
但我不知道為什麼
and I don't know why.

314
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:09,810
我屬於黑夜的嗜血惡性蔓延到了白晝
My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days.

315
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,600
我感到了垂死的氣息 處於狂怒的邊緣
I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy.

316
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,900
我想我理智的面具就快跌落了
I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.

317
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:20,110
" Deck the halls with boughs of holly "

318
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,490
" Fa la la la la La la la la "

319
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,690
" 'Tis the season to be jolly "

320
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:27,190
" Fa la la la la La la la la "

321
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,200
嘿 麥克洛伊 是說什麼?

我一直在這兒 你沒看到我罷了
I've been here the entire time. You just didn't see me.

328
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:54,430
跟雪球說聲好 雪球說"聖誕快樂 帕特裏克"
Say hello to Snowball. Snowball says, "Merry Christmas, Patrick."

329
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,980
- 什麼呀? - 一隻可愛的小豬豬 不是嗎?
- What is it ? - It's a little baby piggly-wiggly, isn't it ?

330
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,480
是只越南大肚子豬
It's a Vietnamese potbellied pig.

331
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,900
真是可愛的寵物 不是嗎?
They make darling pets. Don't you ?

332
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,280
不是嗎?
Don't you ?

333
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,450
別悶悶不樂的 帕特裏克 你簡直就和聖誕怪傑一樣了
Stop scowling, Patrick. You're such a grinch.

334
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,700
那麼聖誕怪傑先生有何聖誕心願?
And what does Mr. Grinch want for Christmas ?

335
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,040
別再提隆胸的事了
And don't say breast implants again.

336
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,630

No, l want to know, okay ? I came here for the cilantro crawfish gumbo,

348
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,630
這也是我們來這家餐廳的唯一理由
which is, after all, the only excuse one could have for being in this restaurant,

349
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,130
可是這現在卻空空如也
which is, by the way, almost completely empty.

350

353
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,100
不想惹火的話就免了吧
Not if you want to keep your spleen.

人們蜂擁而至 這裏真夠熱鬧的
This is a real beehive of activity, Halberstram. This place is hot.

00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:49,050
那是伊萬娜 特朗普嗎?
Is that Ivana Trump ?

362

Oh, geez, Patrick. I mean, Marcus. What are you thinking ?

363
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,850
伊萬娜怎麼會在特克薩卡納出現?
Why would Ivana be at Texarkana ?

那麼 嗯 原來不是羅斯查爾德在做費希爾那單生意嗎?
So, uh, wasn't Rothchild originally handling the Fisher account ?

- 你怎麼弄到收的? - 這我可以告訴你 海博斯坦姆
- How'd you get it ? - Well, I could tell you that, Halberstram,

366
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,030
但隨後我就要殺你滅口
but then I'd have to kill you.

367
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,580
我喜歡肢解少女 你不知道我已經極度瘋狂了嗎?
I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane ?

368
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,880
你膚色真不錯 我是說非常引人注目
Great tan, Marcus. I mean, really impressive.

369
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,750
- 在哪兒曬的? - 沙龍裏
- Where do you tan ? - Salon.

370
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,090

I've got a tanning bed at home. You should look into it.

371

I think she's having dinner with, um, Evelyn Williams.

375
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,440
伊芙琳? 超級美臀
Evelyn ? Great ass.

376
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,190
和那個窩囊廢帕特裏克·巴特曼 混在一起 真可惜
Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.

377
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:49,400
再來杯馬提尼 保羅?
Another martini, Paul ?

378
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,080
你喜歡休伊 劉易斯 & the News的歌嗎?
You like Huey Lewis and the News ?

379
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,330
嗯 還好啦
Um, they're okay.

380
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:05,130
他們的早期作品對我而言太前衛了些
They're early work was a little too new wave for my taste.

381
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:08,170
但83年《運動》專集出來的時候
But when Sports came out in '83,

382
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:11,260
我想他們真正找到了自我 無論在市場上還是藝術上
I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.

383
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,220
整張專集聲音明朗乾脆
The whole album has a clear, crisp sound,

384
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,970
趨於完美的專業演繹煥發出的嶄新光輝
and a new sheen of consummate professionalism...

385
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,270
著實為這些單曲增色不少
that really gives the songs a big boost.

386
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:35,030
他已經和埃爾維斯 科斯特洛相提並論
He's been compared to Elvis Costello,

387
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:39,780
但我以為休伊具有更為良好的 憤世嫉俗的的幽默感
but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.

388
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,790
- 喂 海博斯坦姆? - 什麼事 艾倫?
- Hey, Halberstram ? - Yes, Allen ?

389
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:44,750
為什麼到處都是流行服飾的專欄?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place ?

390
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,670
你有...你有養狗嗎? 有狗糧之類的東西嗎?
Do you... Do you have a dog ? A little chow or something ?

391
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,630
- 沒有 艾倫 - 那是雨衣嗎?
- No, Allen. - Is that a raincoat ?

392
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,970
是的 沒錯
Yes, it is.

393
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:57,590
87年 休伊推出了
In '87, Huey released this...

394
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,600
《前端》 他的最佳專集
Fore, their most accomplished album.

395
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,390
我認為最佳單曲毫無疑問應歸於《殺人單曲》
I think their undisputed masterpiece is "Hip To Be Square."

396
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,230
這首歌如此吸引人 以至大多數人可能都不會去聽歌詞
The song's so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics.

397
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,770
但歌詞是值得回味的 因為它不光是說
But they should, because it's not just about...

398
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,730
迎合時尚之快樂 以及流行潮流之重要
the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends.

399
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:16,030
它也是樂隊的個人宣言... 嘿 保羅!
It's also a personal statement about the band itself. Hey, Paul !

400
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,040
" You couldn't take the punishment "

401
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,580
現在去朵西亞定位呀
Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now,

402
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,750
你這個蠢貨!
you fuckin' stupid bastard !

403
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,590
他媽的混蛋!
You fucking bastard !

404
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,460
" You might think I'm crazy but I don't even care "

405
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,760
" 'Criverse I can tell what's going on "

406
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,700
" It's hip to be square "

407
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,140
" It's hip to be square "

408
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:47,670
" like my bands in mini-suits "

409
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,840
" I watch them on TV "

410
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,620
" I'm working out most everyday "

411
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,680
" And watching what I eat "

412
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,390
" They tell me that it's good for me "

413
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,860
" But I don't even care "

414
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,360
" I know that it's crazy I know that it's nowhere "

415
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,770
" But there is no denying that "

416
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,770
" It's hip to be square "

417
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,500
" It's hip to be square "

418
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,610
他全身赤裸站在桌子上
He was completely naked and standing up on the table.

419
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,150
什麼都沒穿 並且...
He had no clothes on what so ever, and he...

420
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,110
帕特裏克? 帕特裏克
Patrick ? Patrick.

421
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,780
是你嗎?
Is that you ?

422
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:45,120
不 路易斯 不是我 你搞錯了
No, Luis, it's not me. You're mistaken.

423
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,290
這是我最好的朋友 帕特裏克·巴特曼
This is my very good friend, Patrick Bateman.

424
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:51,540
你去哪兒? 我們要去尼爾餐廳 格溫多林的父親要把它買下來
Where are you going ? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father is buying it.

425
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,380
噢
Ooh.

426
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,840
你從哪兒搞來的這睡袋?
Where did you get that overnight bag ?

427
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,300
在吉恩-保羅-高提耶買的
Jean-Paul Gaultier.

428
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,480
我到了保羅·艾倫的家
When I get to Paul Allen's place,

429
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:17,530
用他口袋的的鑰匙開的門
I use the keys I took from his pocket...

430
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,610
在處置屍體之前
before disposing of the body.

431
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,820
我著實驚慌了一陣
There is a moment of sheer panic...

432
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:27,240
當我看到保羅的公寓對面就是公園
when I realize that Paul's apartment overlooks the park...

433
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:30,000
顯然房價要比我的高得多
and is obviously more expensive than mine.

434
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,960
我讓自己平靜下來 進入他的臥室
I calm myself and move into the bedroom,

435
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,210
找到了他的皮箱並開始裝行李
where I find his suitcase and start to pack.

436
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:42,090
保羅該去做個短途旅行了
It's time for Paul to take a little trip.

437
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,260
我該把這混蛋送到哪兒去呢?
Where do I send the bastard ?

438
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,350
達拉斯?
Dallas ?

439
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,940
巴黎? 新加坡?
Paris ? Singapore ?

440
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,150
倫敦? 我要把這混蛋送到倫敦去
London ? I'll send the asshole to London.

441
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:03,660
嗨 我是保羅
Hi. This is Paul.

442
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,820
我被派到倫敦出幾天差
I've been called away to London for a few days.

443
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:09,160
梅瑞狄斯 我回來就給你打電話 回頭見 寶貝
Meredith, I'll call you when I get back. Hasta la vista, baby.

444
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:22,260
" Lady in red "

445
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:28,650
" ls dancing with me "

446
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,960
" Cheek to cheek "

447
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:34,470
" There's nobody here "

448
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,690
什麼事?
What is it ?

449
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,440
- 帕特裏克 - 什麼 吉恩?
- Patrick. - Yes, Jean ?

450
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:43,700
- 有位唐納德 金葆先生要見你 - 誰?
- There's a Mr. Donald Kimball here to see you. - Who ?

451
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,360
唐納德 金葆探長
Detective Donald Kimball.

452
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,450
告訴他我去吃午餐了
Tell him I'm at lunch.

453
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:56,000
帕特裏克 現在才10點半 我想他知道你在這兒
Patrick, it's only 10:30. I think he knows you're here.

454
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,420
那麼就讓他進來吧
Send him in, I guess.

455
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:09,300
聽著 約翰 你該穿合你體型的衣服
Now, John, you've gotta wear clothes in proportion to your physique.

456
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:13,220
朋友 穿粗條紋的襯衫是有講究的
There are definite do's and don'ts, good buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt.

457
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,640
它必須配深色的
A bold-striped shirt calls for solid-colored...

458
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,150
或者圖案鮮明的西裝和領帶
or discreetly patterned suits and ties.

459
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:21,610
對 給設計師百分之十五小費就行
Yes, always tip the stylist 15 percent.

460
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:25,450
聽著 約翰 我得掛了 T·布恩·皮肯斯來了
Listen, John, I've gotta go. T. Boone Pickens just walked in.

461
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:30,200
開個玩笑 不 不用給沙龍老闆小費
Just joking. No, don't tip the owner of the salon.

462
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,200
好了嗎 約翰 好的
Okay, John ? Right.

463
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:35,500
知道了 抱歉了
Got it. Sorry about that.

464
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,170
不 該抱歉的是我 我該先預約的
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.

465
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,170
是很重要的事嗎?
Was that anything important ?

466
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:43,300
哦 沒什麼 談談生意
Oh, that ? Just mulling over business problems,

467
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:47,760
找找機會 飛短流長 閒聊瞎扯而已
examining opportunities, exchanging rumors, spreading gossip.

468
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,010
你好
Hi.

469
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,060
- 我是唐納德 金葆 - 你好 帕特·巴特曼
- I'm Donald Kimball. - Hi. Pat Bateman.

470
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,350
- 幸會 - 抱歉就這麼闖進來了
- Nice to meet you. - Sorry to barge in on you like this.

471
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:58,440
我知道幹你們這行的有多忙
I know how busy you guys can get.

472
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:05,190
那麼 呃 我們要談點什麼呢?
So, what's the, uh, topic of discussion ?

473
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,740
梅瑞狄斯 鮑威爾雇了我
I've been hired by Meredith Powell...

474
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,870
調查保羅·艾倫失蹤的事
to investigate the disappearance of Paul Allen.

475
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,200
明白了 嗯 保羅失蹤的事 嗯
I see, yeah. Paul's disappearance, yeah.

476
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,370
這不算正式的問話
So it's nothing that official.

477
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:20,630
- 我只是問幾個關於保羅·艾倫和你本人的問題 - 要咖啡嗎?
- I just have some questions about Paul Allen and yourself. - Coffee ?

478
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,840
- 不 不必了 - 礦泉水?
- No, I'm okay. - Apollinaris ?

479
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,880
不 真的不必
No, I'm okay.

480
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,510
能為...
Can you bring Mr....

481
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,260
- 金葆 不必麻煩了 - 金葆先生拿瓶礦泉水進來嗎?
- Kimball. No, I'm okay. - Mr. Kimball a bottle of Apollinaris.

482
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,430
小意思
It's no problem.

483
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,230
那麼我們要談什麼來著?
So, what's the topic of discussion ?

484
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,020
保羅·艾倫失蹤的事
The disappearance of Paul Allen.

485
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,730
呃嗯 對 唔 我還沒...
Uh-huh, right. Well, I, um, haven't...

486
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,450
沒聽說任何關於他失蹤的事呢
I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything.

487
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,700
只是沒在報紙第六版上看到
Not on page six, at least.

488
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,450
- 我想他的家人還不想聲張 - 懂了 要檸檬汁嗎?
- I think his family wants this kept quiet. - Understandable. Lime ?

489
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:58,540
- 不用了 真的 - 真的不要 我隨時都可以為你拿一杯來的
- No, really, I'm okay. - You sure ? I can always get you a lime.

490
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,620
就問幾個簡單的問題 我存檔用的 好嗎?
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay ?

491
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,670
問吧
Shoot.

492
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,210
- 你的年齡? - 27歲
- Hold old are you ? - Twenty-seven.

493
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,210
- 在哪兒上的學? - 哈佛

494
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,970

- Then Harvard Business School. - Your address ?

495
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,220
美國花園大廈 西81街
The American Gardens Building, West 81st Street.

496
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,810
- 好極了 很好 - 謝謝
- Nice. Very nice. - Thanks.

497
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:20,600
- 你能告訴我什麼有關保羅·艾倫的事? - 我有點摸不著頭腦
- What can you tell me about Paul Allen ? - I'm at a loss.

498
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,560
- 他就是耶魯那幫人的一分子 - 耶魯那幫人?
- He was part of that whole Yale thing. - "Yale thing" ?

499
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:26,480
- 對 耶魯那幫人 - 你指的是什麼?
- Yeah, Yale thing. - What do you mean, "Yale thing" ?

500
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,490
唔 大致就是說那些私底下搞同性戀
Well, I think for one that he was probably a closet homosexual...

501
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,530
還大吸可卡因的傢伙
who did a lot of cocaine.

502
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,660
這就是耶魯那幫人
That "Yale thing."

503
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,950
除了你剛才說的 他還是什麼樣的人呢?
What kind of man was he, besides the information you've just given ?

504
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,830
- 這裏沒什麼相互對質的事吧? - 你覺得像嗎?
- I hope I'm not being cross-examined here. - You feel like that ?

505
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,000
不 我沒那個意思
No, not really.

506
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,920
保羅常去什麼地方?
Where did Paul hang out ?

507
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,920
- 常去的地方? - 你知道的
- Hang out ? - Yeah, you know, hang out.

508
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:54,180
讓我想想 嗯 在新港 哈里餐廳
Let me think. Um, the Newport, Harry's,

509
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,220
福路戴斯 印度支那
Fluties, Indochina,

510
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,220
尼爾餐廳 康乃爾俱樂部
Nell's, the Cornell Club,

511
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,680
- 紐約遊艇俱樂部 - 他有遊艇嗎?
- the New York Yacht Club. - He had a yacht ?

512
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:04,690
- 不 他不過常去那兒 - 他在哪兒上的學?
- No, he just hung out there. - And where did he go to school ?

513
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,230
你還不知道嗎?
Don't you know this ?

514
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,280
我只是想知道你是否知道
I just wanted to know if you know.

515
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,450
在進耶魯前 如果我沒記錯 是在聖保羅學校
Before Yale, if I remember correctly, St. Paul's.

516
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:19,490
聽著 我只是... 只想幫幫忙
Listen, I just... I just wanna help.

517
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,580
我明白
I understand.

518
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,000
你們有目擊證人或者指紋嗎?
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints ?

519
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,170
哦 他的留言機上留話說他去倫敦了
Well, there's a message on his answering machine that says he went to London.

520
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,800
- 那麼可能他確實去倫敦了 是不是? - 他的女朋友不相信
- Well, maybe he did, huh ? - His girlfriend doesn't think so.

521
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,010
- 有人在倫敦見過他嗎? - 實際上 有
- But has anyone seen him in London ? - Actually, yes.

522
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:39,350
但我很難確證
Hmm. But I've had a hard time getting actual verification.

523
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:43,270
一位叫斯蒂芬·休斯的說他在倫敦的餐廳見到過他
A Stephen Hughes said he saw him at a restaurant there.

524
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,270
但我去查了 結果是
But I checked it out, and what happened is...

525
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,690
他把一位叫赫伯特·安斯沃思的人認作保羅了 所以...
he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth for Paul, so...

526
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:51,030
- 他的公寓遭竊了嗎? - 沒有
- Had his apartment been burglarized ? - No, actually, it hadn't.

527
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:54,650
就不見了一些化妝品 一套西裝 和一些行李
Toiletries were missing, a suit was gone, so was some luggage. That's it.

528
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,160
我是說 還沒人在做刑事調查 是吧?
I mean, no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right ?

529
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,700
不 還沒有 正如我說過的 我們還不確定
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure.

530
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,120
基本上還沒有看到或聽到什麼
Basically, no one's seen or heard anything.

531
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,960
- 很典型 不是嗎? - 只是很奇怪
- So typical, isn't it ? - It's just strange.

532
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,580
某一天 某個身邊的人
One day, someone's walking around,

533
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,170
上得好好的班 生龍活虎的 然而...
going to work, alive, and then...

534
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,670
什麼都沒了
Nothing.

535
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,720
突然他消失得無影無蹤了
People just disappear.

536
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,470
大地...突然裂開把他吞進去了
The earth just... opens up and swallows them.

537
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,850
古怪 確實古怪
Eerie. Really eerie.

538
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,650
聽著 我得失陪了
Listen, you'll have to excuse me.

539
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,990
再過20分鐘 我和克裏斯·哈克斯泰堡在四季餐廳有個午餐會
I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in 20 minutes.

540
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:39,030
四季餐廳? 從新市區去不是很遠嗎?
The Four Seasons ? Isn't that a little far uptown ?

541
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,490
- 我的意思是 你可能要遲到了 - 不 這裏附近就有一家
- I mean, aren't you gonna be late ? - No, there's one down here.

542
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,040
- 哦 真的嗎? 我還不知道呢 - 不錯 很好的餐廳
- Oh, really ? I didn't know that. - Yeah, it's very good.

543
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,250
聽著 如果你想起了什麼 任何事...
Listen, if anything else occurs to you, any information...

544
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:52,000
- 沒問題 我會一五一十全告訴你的 - 太好了
- Absolutely. I'm 100 percent with you. - Great.

545
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:55,720
耽誤你的時間了 巴特曼先生
And thanks for your time, Mr. Bateman.

546
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,600
- 再會 - 再見
- Bye-bye. - Good-bye.

547
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:04,280
- 我以前沒見過你 - 你沒注意看而已
- I haven't seen you around here. - You just haven't been lookin'.

548
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:08,750
- 想到我的公寓看看嗎? - 我一般不去的
- Would you like to see my apartment ? - I'm not supposed to.

549
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,380
你到底來不來?
Do you wanna come to my apartment or not ?

550
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,970
我一般不去 但也有例外
I'm not supposed to, but I can make an exception.

551
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,640
你收信用卡嗎?
Do you take a credit card ?

552
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,310
開個玩笑
I'm joking.

553
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,350
來吧 上車
Come on. Get in.

554
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,940
我要一個二十幾歲的姑娘
I'd like a girl. Early 20s.

555
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:43,450
金髮的 會玩雙人的 雙人
Blonde, who does couples. Couples.

556
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:47,950
我沒法把金髮更為強調 金髮女郎
And I really can't stress blonde enough. Blonde.

557
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:52,710
我叫保羅
I'm Paul.

558
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:56,000
我叫保羅·艾倫 你聽明白了嗎?
My name's Paul Allen. You got that ?

559
00:38:56,090 --> 00:39:00,010
你叫克利斯蒂 叫你克利斯蒂你才應
You're Christie. You're to respond only to Christie.

560
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,930
明白了嗎?
Is that clear ?

561
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:07,500
" If you don't know me by now "

562
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,540
" If you don't know me "

563
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,940
" You will never never know me "

564
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,060
你在喝的是很棒的夏敦埃酒
That's a very fine chardonnay you're drinking.

565
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,880
我要你把你那兒洗洗乾淨
I want you to clean your vagina.

566
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:23,520
" If you don't know me by now "

567
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,790
" You will never never know me "

568
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:29,080
不 從後面來 跪下去
No. From behind. Get on your knees.

569
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,960
你的身體很美
You have a very nice body.

570
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,550
嗯?
Mm-hmm ?

571
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,300
謝謝 讓她上來
Thank you. Send her up.

572
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,060
克利斯蒂 出來擦乾身體
Christie, get out and dry off.

573
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,020
選件浴袍...不要穿睡衣...
Choose a robe... not the Bijan...

574
00:39:56,100 --> 00:40:00,570
再來客廳見我和我們的客人 喝一杯
and come and meet me and our guest in the living room for drinks.

575
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:09,490
你來了 真可愛
You've arrived. How lovely.

576
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,490
把大衣給我吧
Let me take your coat.

577
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,330
我叫保羅 你能來真是太好了
I'm Paul. How good of you to come.

578
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:21,090
頭髮還不夠金黃 不是嗎?
Not quite blonde, are you ?

579
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:23,090
顏色有點暗
More dirty blonde.

580
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,630
我要叫你薩比裏娜
I'm gonna call you Sabrina.

581
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,800
我叫保羅·艾倫
I'm Paul Allen.

582
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,070
那麼
So.

583
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,120
你們不想知道我幹哪行的嗎?
Don't you wanna know what I do ?

584
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,080
- 不 - 不用了
- No. - No, not really.

585
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,840
唔 我在華爾街上班
Well, I work on Wall Street...

586
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,170
P&P公司
for Pierce & Pierce.

587
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,340
你們聽說過嗎?
Have you heard of it ?

588
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:19,230
你的家真不錯 保羅
You have a really nice place here, Paul.

589
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,270
房租多少?
How much did you pay for it ?

590
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,400
唔 實際上
Well, actually,

591
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,320
這不干你事 克利斯蒂
that's none of your business, Christie.

592
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,200
但我可以明確地告訴你 房租當然不會便宜
But I can assure you, it certainly wasn't cheap.

593
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,530
不 別吸煙 這兒禁止吸煙
No. No smoking. Not in here.

594
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,080
瓦爾達松露?
Varda truffle ?

595
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,880
我不想讓你們喝醉
I don't want you to get drunk,

596
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,260
但那兒有很好的夏敦埃酒 你卻不喝
but that's a very fine chardonnay you're not drinking.

597
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,350
喜歡菲爾·柯林斯嗎?
Do you like Phil Collins ?

598
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,640
自從1980年創世紀發行了專輯《公爵》之後
I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release...

599
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:01,730
我就成了他們的大樂迷
of their 1980 album Duke.

600
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:06,530
在此之前 我對他們的作品一竅不通
Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work.

601
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:09,650
它們太藝術了 太費解了
It was too artsy, too intellectual.

602
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,450
正是在《公爵》裏
It was on Duke where...

603
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,450
菲爾·柯林斯脫穎而出
Phil Collins' presence became more apparent.

604
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,040
我認為《無形的接觸》是創世紀 無可爭議的最佳單曲
I think Invisible Touch is the group's undisputed masterpiece.

605
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,550
它是有關不可捉摸事務的史詩性沉思
It's an epic meditation on intangibility.

606
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:35,310
同時 它又深化豐富了
At the same time, it deepens and enriches...

607
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,770
緊接著三張專集的內涵
the meaning of the preceding three albums.

608
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,850
克利斯蒂 把浴袍脫掉
Christie, take off the robe.

609
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,980
請聽班克斯·柯林斯和盧瑟福的
Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing...

610
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,690
輝煌的合唱
of Banks, Collins and Rutherford.

611
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:53,110
你甚至能聽辨出每件樂器的細微差別
You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument.

612
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,120
薩比裏娜 把衣服脫掉
Sabrina, remove your dress.

613
00:42:56,830 --> 00:43:00,290
談到作詞和作曲
In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer songwriting,

614
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:03,370
這張專集攀上了一個新的高峰
this album hits a new peak of professionalism.

615
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,880
薩比裏娜 你為什麼不 嗯 跳跳舞呢
Sabrina, why don't you, uh, dance a little.

616
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,880
舉《混亂之島》的歌詞為例
Take the lyrics to "Land of Confusion."

617
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,090
在這首歌裏 菲爾·柯林斯
In this song, Phil Collins...

618
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:16,220
談到了政府濫用權力的問題
addresses the problems of abusive political authority.

619
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:21,980
《陷得太深》是80年代最感人的流行歌曲
"In Too Deep" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s...

620
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,360
有關夫妻之間的彼此忠貞
about monogamy and commitment.

621
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,730
這歌如此積極向上
The song is extremely uplifting.

622
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:32,200
歌詞積極樂觀
Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative...

623
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,490
象 呃 任何我所聽到的搖滾樂一樣
as, uh, anything I've heard in rock.

624
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,160
克利斯蒂 跪下來
Christie, get down on your knees...

625
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:45,290
把屁股對著薩比裏娜
so Sabrina can see your asshole.

626
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:48,040
菲爾·柯林斯的獨唱生涯
Phil Collins' solo career...

627
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:50,960
似乎商業味更濃
seems to be more commercial,

628
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:54,180
因此狹義地說更讓人滿意
and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way,

629
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:58,810
特別是像《今夜浮空》 和《針對可能》這樣的歌
especially songs like "In the Air Tonight" and "Against All Odds."

630
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:02,730
薩比裏娜 別光看呀 用舔的
Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it.

631
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,770
我還認為菲爾·柯林斯在樂隊的表現
I also think that Phil Collins works best...

632
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:11,900
比他獨唱要好
within the confines of the group than as a solo artist.

633
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:15,360
我強調的是作為一個藝術家
And I stress the word "artist."

634
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:21,290
這首是《薩斯賽迪歐》
This is "Sussudio."

635
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:24,370
一首非常非常好的歌 我個人的最愛
A great, great song. A personal favorite.

636
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,090
看著鏡頭
Look at the camera.

637
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,060
" All the time "

638
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:45,640
" Su-Sussuido "

639
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,640
" Oh, oh "

640
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:55,840
" Now, she don't even know my name "

641
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:58,550
" But I think she likes mejust the same "

642
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:01,220
" Su- Sussuido "

643
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:05,290
" Oh, oh "

644
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:13,070
" Oh, if she'd call me I'd be there "

645
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:14,610
" I'd come running "

646
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:18,890
克利斯蒂 看著鏡頭
Christie, look at the camera.

647
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,450
" All of my life "

648
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:21,950
" I feel so good "

649
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:26,280
" If I just say the worrd "

650
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,220
" Su-Sussuido "

651
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:36,030
別碰表
Don't touch the watch.

652
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:00,180
我們能走了嗎?
Can we go now ?

653
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,140
還沒完呢
We're not through yet.

654
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:23,450
如果她們性情很好而相貌平平 還有誰會去理她們
If they have a good personality and they are not great looking, then who fucking cares ?

655
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,450
我們只是打個比方 好嗎?
Let's just say hypothetically, okay ?

656
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,790
如果她們性情好會怎麼樣?
What if they have a good personality ?

657
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:30,960
我知道 我知道
I know. I know.

658
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,630
根本沒有性情好的女人
There are no girls with good personalities.

659
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:36,550
所謂性情好包括要有一個強壯的身體
A good personality consists of a chick with a little hard body...

660
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:38,550
可以滿足各種各樣的性需要
who will satisfy all sexual demands...

661
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,550
但不能過分淫蕩
without being too slutty about things...

662
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,550
並且還要守口如瓶
and who will essentially keep her dumb fucking mouth shut.

663
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,600
擁有良好性情的女人
The only girls with good personalities...

664
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,890
也許很聰明 也許很有趣 也許蠢得要死 或者智力超群...
who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or talented...

665
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:50,850
只要上帝才知道這是什麼意思... 都是醜女人
though God knows what the fuck that means... are ugly chicks.

666
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,230
毫無疑問 因為這是她們彌補
Absolutely. And this is because they have to make up...

667
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,110
她們缺乏吸引力的唯一方法
for how fucking unattractive they are.

668
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:58,400
- 你們知道埃德·蓋因怎麼談女人的嗎? - 坎奈爾酒吧的領班?
- Do you know what Ed Gein said about women ? - Maitre d' at Canal Bar ?

669
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:02,450
- 不 50年代的連環殺手 威斯康星州的 - 他怎麼說的?
- No, serial killer, Wisconsin, in the 50s. - And what did Ed say ?

670
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:05,620
"我在街上看到漂亮娘們的時候 我會想兩件事"
"When I see a pretty girl walking down the street, I think two things.

671
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,120
"一方面我想和她約會與她聊天
"One part of me wants to take her out and talk to her,

672
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,710
對她照顧備至 小心呵護"
be real nice and sweet and treat her right."

673
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:13,210
那麼他另一方面想幹嗎?
And what did the other part of him think ?

674
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:15,880
"把她腦袋插在木棍上會怎麼樣? "
What her head would look like on a stick.

675
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:23,970
嗨 我想聽聽你們的意見
Hi, guys. I wanna get your opinion on something.

676
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:27,720
這是我的名片
It's my business card.

677
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,230
我也決定做張新的了
I decided to get a new one too.

678
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:34,690
哦 它...
Oh, it's...

679
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:36,690
相對不錯 路易斯
Very nice, Luis.

680
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,150
謝謝
Thank you.

681
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,130
聽著 晚飯去哪兒吃?
Listen, what about dinner ?

682
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:59,000
你就會說這個嗎? 范·派頓 "晚飯去他媽的哪兒吃? "
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten ? "What about fucking dinner" ?

683
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:02,130
開心點 巴特曼 你怎麼了? 早上沒做指壓按摩嗎?
Cheer up there, Bateman. What's the matter ? No shiatsu this morning ?

684
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:05,470
- 再碰我 我就跟你沒完 - 別激動 夥計
- Keep touching me like that, you'll draw back a stump. - Hold on there, little buddy.

685
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:07,470
失陪了
Excuse me.

686
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,760
上帝啊 帕特裏克 幹嗎在這兒呢?
God. Patrick. Why here ?

687
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,470
我看到你對我眉目傳情了
I've seen you looking at me.

688
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,770
我感覺到了
I've noticed your...

689
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:56,480
你火熱的身體
hot body.

690
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,560
別害羞
Don't be shy.

691
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:00,820
你不知道我等這天等了多久...
You can't imagine how long I've wanted this...

692
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:03,530
自從亞利桑那州 206的聖誕派對以來
ever since that Christmas party at Arizona 206.

693
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:06,860
你知道的 那天你戴了條 阿瑪尼紅條紋花呢領帶
You know, the one you were wearing that red-striped paisley Armani tie.

694
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:14,330
我要你 我也要你
I want you. I want you too.

695
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:16,330
- 帕特裏克 - 怎麼回事?
- Patrick. - What is it ?

696
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,500
你去哪兒?
Where are you going ?

697
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,380
我要去還幾盤錄像帶
I've gotta return some video tapes.

698
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:32,970
帕特裏克!
Patrick !

699
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,460
好的 倫敦...
Okay, London the...

700
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,380
- 倫敦 呃 有定房... - 有和保羅·艾倫有關的嗎?
- London, there's, um, a reservation... - Any Paul Allen ?

701
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,840
- 沒有 定了房 但是... - 金葆!
- No. A reservation, but... - Kimball !

702
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,050
我正想跟你談談呢 來我的辦公室吧
I've been wanting to talk with you. Come into my office.

703
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:08,050
吉恩 你的上衣很漂亮 是馬特斯圖塔嗎?
Jean, great jacket. Matsuta ?

704
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:12,100
能想起保羅失蹤那晚你在哪兒嗎?
Do you remember where you were the night of Paul's disappearance,

705
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:14,100
12月20號那天
which was on the 20th of December ?

706
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:16,180
上帝
God.

707
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:19,350
我想我可能去還錄像帶了
I guess I was probably returning video tapes.

708
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:24,770
我和一個名叫薇若妮卡的姑娘有個約會
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.

709
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,320
- 和我聽說的不一樣呀 - 什麼?
- That's not what I've got. - What ?

710
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,780
我聽說的不是這樣的
That's not the information I've received.

711
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:32,160
唔 等等
Well, I... Wait.

712
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,200
- 你聽說的是怎麼樣的? - 讓我看看
- What information have you received ? - Let me see.

713
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:38,120
唔...
Well...

714
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,120
- 你和... - 嗯 我可能記錯了
- You were with... - Well, I could be wrong.

715
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:43,790
你最後一次見保羅·艾倫是什麼時候?
When was the last time you were with Paul Allen ?

716
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,130
我們一同去聽一個音樂劇
We'd gone to a new musical...

717
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:49,760
叫"哦 非洲 勇敢的非洲"
called Oh, Africa, Brave Africa.

718
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,970
是出笑鬧劇 就這樣
It was a laugh riot. That was about it.

719
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,430
我想我們在奧搜餐廳吃了晚飯 不 披頭... 不 奧搜餐廳
I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Peto... No, Orso's.

720
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:59,770
我希望能對你有所幫助 日子久了 記憶有點混亂
I hope I've been informative. Long day, a bit scattered.

721
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:01,810
我現在也精疲力盡了
I'm a little spent now too.

722
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:05,020
過一個星期左右吃頓午飯怎麼樣?
But how about lunch in a week or so...

723
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:07,360
等我把這些頭緒理清之後
when I've sorted out all this information ?

724
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,360
好極了 是的 我很願意
Great. Yes, I'd like that.

725
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,660
如果我能確定你到底在哪兒
And if you could try and pin down where you were...

726
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:16,370
在保羅·艾倫失蹤那晚 我的活就好幹多了
the night of Paul Allen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.

727
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:18,700
當然 我會跟你一起努力回憶的
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.

728
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:24,250
休伊 劉易斯 & News
Huey Lewis and the News.

729
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,170
好東西 我在來這兒的路上買的 你聽過嗎?
Great stuff. I just bought it on my way here. You heard it ?

730
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:35,260
從來沒有 我的意思是我不喜歡流行歌手
Never. I mean, I don't really like singers.

731
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:38,850
- 不是個樂迷 是吧? - 我喜歡音樂
- Not a big music fan, huh ? - No, I like music.

732
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:43,600
因為他們...休伊的歌對我來說太灰調了
Just they're... Huey's too black sounding for me.

733
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:45,730
各有所好
To each his own.

734
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:50,030
那麼 下週一起吃午飯?
So, lunch next week ?

735
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:52,030
我會去的
I'll be there.

736
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,120
哦!
Oh !

737
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:05,210
哦!
Oh !

738
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:31,360
- 復活節前你會給我打電話嗎? - 也許吧
- Will you call me before Easter ? - Maybe.

739
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,990
你今晚幹什麼?
What are you doing tonight ?

740
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:39,870
呃 在河畔餐廳吃飯
Dinner at, uh, River Cafe.

741
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:43,250
- 然後去酒吧 也許 - 不錯
- Au Bar afterwards, maybe. - That's nice.

742
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:48,000
我還不知道你也抽煙呢
I never knew you smoked.

743
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,000
你沒留心罷了
You never noticed.

744
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:55,550
聽著 帕特裏克
Listen, Patrick.

745
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,470
我們能談談嗎?
Can we talk ?

746
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,890
你看起來...帥極了
You look... marvelous.

747
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,860
沒什麼好談的
There's nothing to say.

748
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:13,490
- 你馬上要嫁給拉西了 - 這難道不值一提?
- You're gonna marry Luis. - Isn't that special ?

749
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:16,950
帕特裏克
Patrick ?

750
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:23,410
什麼事 考特妮?
Yes, Courtney ?

751
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,750
如果我在復活節前見不到你
If I don't see you before Easter,

752
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,920
你自己玩得開心點 好嗎?
have a nice one, okay ?

753
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,880
你也是
You too.

754
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,180
帕特裏克?
Patrick ?

755
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:48,190
嗯?
Yeah ?

756
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,110
沒什麼
Nothing.

757
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:04,550
" Pump up the volume "

758
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,510
" Pump up the volume "

759
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:22,140
現在有個說法... 聽我說
There is this theory now... Listen to me.

760
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:24,140
現在有個說法說 如果你因為和艾滋病人做愛
There is this theory now that if you can catch the AIDS virus...

761
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:27,640
而染上艾滋病 那麼你就有可能得任何一種病
by having sex with someone who's infected, then you can catch anything.

762
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,020
老年癡呆 肌肉萎縮 血友病
Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia,

763
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,820
白血病 糖尿病 失語癥
leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia.

764
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,610
我不敢肯定 但我不認為 失語癥是病毒引起的
I'm not sure, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.

765
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,070
可誰知道呢? 他們才不知道呢
But who knows ? They don't know that.

766
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,070
證明給我看
Prove it.

767
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:54,590
- 我 上帝 - 怎麼了?
- Oh, God. - What ?

768
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:58,130
這簡直就是一小堆甜粉 我是要用它來爽的
It's a fucking milligram of sweetener. I wanna get high off this,

769
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:00,510
- 不是把它灑在我他媽的燕麥粥上 - 確實弱得可憐
- not sprinkle it on my fucking oatmeal. - It's definitely weak,

770
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:02,720
但我想如果我們多來點 也許會好些
but I have a feeling if we do enough of it, we'll be okay.

771
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,260
你們能小聲點嗎? 我在嗑藥呢
Can you keep it down ? I'm trying to do drugs.

772
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:08,680
- 去你的! - 別激動 我們就這麼來吧
- Fuck you ! - Calm down. Let's do it anyway.

773
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:10,730
這就對了
That's right.

774
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:12,770
如果隔壁的基佬覺得好就行了!
That is if the faggot in the next stall thinks it's okay !

775
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:14,770
- 去你的! - 嘿 去你的!
- Fuck you ! - Hey, fuck you !

776
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,610
對不起 哥兒們 激素的作用
Sorry, dude. Steroids.

777
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:22,060
好了 我們來吧
Okay, let's do it.

778
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:24,050
" I wanna know "

779
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,390
" What you're thinking "

780
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:30,020
" There are some things you can't hide "

781
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:32,160
" I wanna know "

782
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:34,800
" What you're feeling "

783
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:37,640
" Tell me what's on your mind "

784
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:44,760
克雷格去哪兒了?
Where did Craig go ?

785
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:48,260
嗯 戈爾巴喬夫在樓下 麥克德莫特去跟他簽
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs. McDermott went to sign a peace treaty...

786
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:50,270
美俄和平協議去了
between the United States and Russia.

787
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:53,100
他是公開化政策的幕後策劃人
He's the one behind Glasnost.

788
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:56,650
- 他說他做的是股權的併購和重組 - 你們搞錯了 是吧?
- He said he was in mergers and acquisitions. - You're not confused, are you ?

789
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:58,780
沒有 怎麼會
No, not really.

790
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:01,690
- 戈爾巴喬夫不在樓下 - 克倫說得對
- Gorbachev is not downstairs. - Karen's right.

791
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,450
戈爾巴喬夫是不在樓下 他在隧道裏
Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.

792
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:06,450
問我個問題吧
Ask me a question.

793
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:09,790
好吧 你是幹什麼的?
So, what do you do ?

794
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:13,290
我是 呃 基本上在 和殺人犯和死刑打交道
I'm into, uh, well, murders and executions, mostly.

795
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:17,210
- 你喜歡這活嗎? - 唔 這要看情況 幹嗎這麼問?
- Do you like it ? - Well, it depends. Why ?

796
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:22,550
唔 我認識的那些做股票的傢伙 都不喜歡玩股票
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions really don't like it.

797
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:28,560
好吧 你怎麼猜到的?
So, where do you work out ?

798
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:33,770
你不會認為我真的很笨吧?
You think I'm dumb, don't you ?

799
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:36,940
- 什麼? - 你認為我很笨 你認為所有的模特都是笨蛋
- What ? - You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.

800
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:39,860
不 我才不呢
No. I really don't.

801
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:42,690
那沒什麼 我不在乎
That's okay. I don't mind.

802
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:44,700
你挺討人喜歡的
There's something sweet about you.

803
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:13,100
在玩填字遊戲?
Doin' the crossword ?

804
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:20,400
要我幫忙嗎?

你能陪我吃頓晚飯嗎?
Would you like to accompany me to dinner ?

807
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:39,750
我是說 如果你沒事的話
That is, if you're not doing anything.

808
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:42,590
嗯 不 我沒事 我沒任何安排

好
Well,

810
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:51,050
真是太巧了
isn't this a coincidence ?

811
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:53,430
- 聽著 我們要去哪兒? - 隨你便
- Listen, where should we go ? - Anywhere you want.

812
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,480
我們別管我想去哪兒 你到底想去哪兒?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want ?

813
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:01,060
我不知道 帕特裏克 我沒法做這樣的決定
I don't know, Patrick. I can't make this decision.

814
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:04,860
快點 你想去哪兒?
Come on. Where do you wanna go ?

815
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:09,780
不管想去哪兒 告訴我 我會設法安排的
Anywhere you want, just say it. I can get us in anywhere.

簡單說說 概括一下

我正處在最多選擇的人生階段
I'm at a point in my life where there seems to be so many possibilities,

853
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:43,690
可我...我不知道... 我一點也不能確定
but I'm... I don't know... I'm just so unsure.

854

856
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:57,450
你有合適的對象嗎? 我是說真的

I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work.

863
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:21,810
但現在我已經開始 考慮改變自我了 你知道的
But now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know,

864
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:24,390
發展一下自我
developing and growing.

865
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,690
發展 很高興聽你這麼說

- Had you heard this ? - Who's Ted Bundy ?

869
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:45,410

Forget it.

870
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,120

Anyway, you never called me and you said you would,

888
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:08,460

898
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,960
你要我離開嗎?
Do you want me to go ?

899
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,960
是的
Yeah.

900
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,760
我想我會控制不住自己的
I don't think I can control myself.

901
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:05,760
我明白 我該離開的 我知道我總會和得不到的男人糾纏不清
I know. I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men.

902
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:10,230
我是說
I mean,

903
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,270
你真要我走嗎?
do you want me to go ?

904
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,320
我想如果你留下來
I think if you stay,

905
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,070
就會發生一些不好的事
something bad will happen.

906
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,320
我想我會傷害你的
I think I might hurt you.

907
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:27,160
你不想受到傷害 是嗎?
You don't wanna get hurt, do you ?

908
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,540
不 當然不
No. No, I guess not.

909
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:33,540
我不想被打得鼻青臉腫的
I don't wanna get bruised.

910
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:38,420
說的沒錯 你是該走了
You're right. I should go.

911
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:49,010
哦 別忘了你明天中午要和唐納德 金葆 在史密斯 & Wolenski餐廳吃飯
Oh. Don't forget you have a lunch date tomorrow with Donald Kimball at Smith and Wolenski's.

912
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:52,430
謝謝
Thanks.

913
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,810
這事我都忘光了
It slipped my mind completely.

914
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:17,830
他失蹤的那晚...
So, the night he disappeared...

915
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,670
你想起你幹了什麼了嗎?
any new thoughts about what you did ?

916
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:26,090
還是不能確定 唔 我沖了個澡
Not sure. Um, I had a shower...

917
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:28,090
吃了果汁冰淇淋?
and some sorbet ?

918
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:30,220
我想你把約會的人搞錯了
I think you're getting your dates mixed up.

919
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:32,220
怎麼會呢?
But how ?

920
01:05:32,310 --> 01:05:35,350
你說那天晚上...保羅在哪兒?
Where do you place... Paul that night ?

921
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,940
根據他的記事本 經他的秘書確證
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary,

922
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:41,980
他和馬克斯 海博斯坦姆一起吃的晚飯
he had dinner with Marcus Halberstram.

923
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:44,280
- 還有呢? - 我詢問了他
- And ? - I questioned him.

924
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:48,620
- 馬克斯嗎? - 是的 他否認了這點 儘管一開始他也不能確定
- Marcus ? - Yes, and he denies it, though, at first, he couldn't be sure.

925
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:51,620
- 但他否認了 - 是的
- But he denied it. - Yes.

926
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:54,910
那麼馬克斯有不在腸證人嗎?
Well, does Marcus have an alibi ?

927
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,460
- 有 - 他有嗎? 你確定?
- Yes. He does ? - You're sure ?

928
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:00,460
我查過了 沒問題
I checked it out. It's clean.

929
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:08,010
那麼 你當時在哪兒?
Now, where were you ?

930
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:10,180
馬克斯在哪兒?
Where was Marcus ?

931
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:12,430
他沒和保羅·艾倫在一起
He wasn't with Paul Allen.

932
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,640
- 那他和誰在一起? - 他在...
- Who was he with ? - He was...

933
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,190
亞特蘭蒂斯和...
at Atlantis... with...

934
01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:21,310
克雷格·麥克德莫特 弗雷德裏克·迪布爾 哈里·紐曼 喬治...
Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner...

935
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,940
還有...你在一起
and... you.

936
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,070
哦 對啦 是的 當然如此
Oh, right, yeah. Of course.

937
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:34,330
我們在等保羅·艾倫來
We had wanted Paul Allen to come,

938
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:36,580
但他另有安排
but he had made plans.

939
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:40,630
我想我和維多利亞吃飯是在第二天晚上
And I guess I had dinner with Victoria the following night.

940
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:43,090
我個兒以為 這傢伙可能惹了點麻煩
Personally, I think the guy went a little nutso.

941
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:48,050
因此出去避避風頭 也許他真去倫敦了 去閒逛喝酒什麼的
Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London, sightseeing, drinking, whatever.

942
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:52,350
不管怎麼說 我相信他遲早會現身的 我的意思是 認為
Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later. I mean, to think...

943
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:57,680
他被他的某個朋友莫名其妙地殺了 無論如何有點可笑
that one of his friends killed him for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous.

944
01:06:57,730 --> 01:07:00,020
是這樣嗎 帕特裏克?
Isn't that right, Patrick ?

945
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,330
克利斯蒂 克利斯蒂
Christie. Christie.

946
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:27,170
我不知道我該不該去 上次出來我就進急診室了
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time.

947
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:30,010
這次絕對不會像上次那樣了 我保證
This won't be anything like last time. I promise.

948
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:32,890
我不相信
I don't think so.

949
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:36,260
快上車吧 我們就談一分鐘
Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute.

950
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:38,270
司機在這兒呢 你很安全的
The driver's here. You'll be safe.

951
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,500
絕對不會像上次那樣 我保證
Nothing like last time. Promise.

952
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:01,500
好吧
All right.

953
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:04,880
嗯 你看起來很美 最近怎麼樣?
So, you're looking great. How have you been ?

954
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,800
- 實際上我上次差點都要動手術了 - 真的嗎?
- Well, I actually might need surgery after last time. - Really ?

955
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:12,970
我朋友甚至跟我說我應該請個律師
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.

956
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:15,720
律師太麻煩了
Lawyers are so complicated.

957
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,350
別聽她的
Don't do that.

958
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:20,350
這兒有張支票
Here's a check.

959
01:09:08,150 --> 01:09:11,990
呃 現在一半 完事另一半
Uh-uh. Half now, half later.

960
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:20,740
好吧 你就叫克利斯蒂
Okay, your name is Christie.

961
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:23,460
我們要和我的一個朋友 伊麗莎白會面
We're meeting a friend of mine, Elizabeth.

962
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:27,960
她馬上就會到我的新公寓來的
She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly.

963
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:31,460
你會喜歡她的 她是個很好的姑娘
You'll like her. She's a very nice girl.

964
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:41,180
你看起來真面熟 到過道爾頓嗎?
You look really familiar. Did you go to Dalton ?

965
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,310
我想我在"衝浪"酒吧遇到過你 對不對? 和史派西在一起?
I think I met you at Surf Bar, didn't I ? With Spicey ?

966
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:49,610
唔 也許不是和史派西 但肯定在"衝浪"酒吧 你知道的 "衝浪"酒吧
Well, maybe not with Spicey, but definitely at SurfBar. You know, SurfBar.

967
01:09:49,650 --> 01:09:51,820
不管怎麼說 "衝浪"酒吧現在糟透了 真糟
Anyway, Surf Bar sucks now. It's terrible.

968
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:57,070
到那兒去參加馬爾科姆·福布斯的生日派對 哦 上帝啊 饒了我吧
Went to a birthday party there for Malcolm Forbes. Oh, my God, please.

969
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,700
這比你另外那個公寓還要好
This is nicer than your other apartment.

970
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:04,000
哦 沒那麼誇張
Oh, it's not that nice.

971
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:12,340
- 你們兩個怎麼認識的? - 哦 上帝 我們在...
- Where did you two meet ? - Oh, God. We met at...

972
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:16,840
哦 上帝 肯德基的德比認識的 85或者86年
oh, God, at the Kentucky Derby in '85, or '86.

973
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,220
你那時候和那個淫蕩的阿利森·普爾混在一起 真是個風騷貨
You were hanging out with that bimbo Allison Poole. Hot number.

974
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,560
你什麼意思? 她不是風騷貨
What do you mean ? She was a hot number.

975
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:27,230
只要你有白金卡 她就給你做口交 這娘們在日光沙龍幹 你知道的
If you had a platinum card, she'd give you a blowjob. This girl worked in a tanning salon.

976
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:29,850
你幹哪行的?
What do you do ?

977
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:33,860
她是...我侄女
She's my... cousin.

978
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:37,820
- 呃 - 她從...巴黎來
- Uh-huh. - She's from... France.

979
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:41,240
你的電話呢? 我得給哈雷打個電話
Where's your phone ? I've gotta call Harley.

980
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:48,420
你在哪兒度暑假 南漢普頓?
Where do you summer, South Hampton ?

981
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:52,750
- 不 - 哦 上帝 是他的留言機
- No. - Oh, God, it's his machine.

982
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:56,880
- 現在是凌晨3點 - 他是賣藥的 現在生意正好呢
- It's 3:00 in the morning. - He's a goddamn drug dealer. These are his peak hours.

983
01:10:56,970 --> 01:10:59,050
- 別告訴你在這兒 - 我怎麼會呢?
- Don't tell him you're here. - Why would I ?

984
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:01,050
這味道真怪
This tastes weird.

985
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:05,430
哈雷 是我 我需要你的服務 隨你怎麼理解這意思
Harley, it's me. I need your services. Translate that however you want.

986
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:09,270
- 我在... - 保羅·艾倫家

I want the number, idiot. Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you again later.

989

要是明晚在坎奈爾酒吧看不到你 我就會讓我的理髮師找你算帳
And if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm gonna sic my hairdresser on you.

990
01:11:19,570 --> 01:11:21,490
你認識那個失蹤的傢伙嗎?
Did you know that guy who disappeared ?

991
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:24,450
他不也在P&P工作嗎? 他是你朋友嗎?
Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce ? Was he a friend of yours ?

992
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,450
不是
No.

993
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:29,410
你有可樂嗎? 或者翡翠屬?
Do you have any coke ? Or Halcyon ?

- 我想來杯翡翠屬 - 聽著
- I would take a Halcyon. - Listen.

995

我只想看看
I would just like to see...

996
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:38,920
你們兩個...幹起來
the two of you... get it on.

997
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:42,180
有什麼不妥嗎?
What's wrong with that ?

998
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:44,510
肯定不會染上病的
It's totally disease free.

999
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:49,430
- 帕特裏克 你瘋了 - 來吧
- Patrick, you're a lunatic. -Come on.

1000
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:51,810
你不認為克利斯蒂很吸引人嗎?
Don't you find Christie attractive ?

1001
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:55,650
別來色的 我沒心情講葷段子
Let's not get lewd. I'm in no mood for a lewd conversation.

1002
01:11:55,690 --> 01:11:58,030
來吧
Come on.

1003
01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:01,530
- 我覺得這很讓人興奮 - 他老這麼幹嗎?
- I think it'd be a turn-on. - Does he do this all the time ?

1004
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,990
克利斯蒂 你沒喝你的酒
Christie, you're not drinking your wine.

1005
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,910
你是說你從來沒和女的搞過?
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?

1006
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,130
沒有 我不是同性戀
No. I'm not a lesbian.

1007
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:17,050
你為什麼認為我會幹這個?
Why would you think I would be into that ?

1008
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:19,300
唔 你去找薩拉·勞倫斯就為了一件事
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.

1009
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:23,970
那些是薩拉·勞倫斯那幫傢伙幹的 你讓我感覺怪怪的
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.

1010
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,520
你知道
Did you know...

1011
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:34,060
惠特尼·休斯頓的首張密紋唱片
that Whitney Houston's debut LP...

1012
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:37,150
叫做《簡單的惠特尼休斯頓》
called simply Whitney Houston...

1013
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:40,030
包含了四首第一流的單曲?
had four number-one singles on it ?

1014
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:43,610
你知道嗎 克利斯蒂?
Did you know that, Christie ?

1015
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:47,120
你到底聽不聽惠特尼休斯頓的歌?
You actually listen to Whitney Houston ?

1016
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,990
你有她的CD嗎?
You own a Whitney Houston CD ?

1017
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:54,580
不止一張?
More than one ?

1018
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:58,130
這麼多精彩的曲目裏挑最好的相當困難
It's hard to choose a favorite among so many great tracks.

1019
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:05,010
但這首《最偉大的愛》 是有史以來
But the "Greatest Love Of All" is one of the best, most powerful songs...

1020
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:07,260
最好最勁的歌曲之一
ever written...

1021
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:11,560
關於自我尊嚴的維護
about self-preservation...and dignity.

1022
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,230
這事跨越國界的全球之聲
It's universal message crosses all boundaries...

1023
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:17,480
並且潛移默化地 把這樣一個希望告訴人們
and instills one...

1024
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:21,150
現在開始改善自我
with the hope that it's not too late...

1025
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:23,570
還不算太晚
to better ourselves.

1026
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:26,990
因為 伊麗莎白
Since, Elizabeth,

1027
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:32,040
在我們生活的這個世界 和別人同情連心是不可能的
it's impossible in this world we live in to empathize with others,

1028
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:35,670
但我們總能和自己同情連心吧
we can always empathize with ourselves.

1029
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:40,040
這是很重要的一點 確實至關重要
It's an important message. Crucial, really.

1030
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:45,880
而它通過這張專集優美地傳達出來
And it's beautifully stated on the album.

1031
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:58,250
竟敢打我的臉!
Not the face !

1032
01:14:58,330 --> 01:15:02,380

You bitch, not the fucking face, you piece of bitch trash !

1033

我想要一個確定的承諾
I want a firm commitment.

1034
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:37,390
我想 呃 伊芙琳 我們已經沒什麼共同語言了
I think, um, Evelyn, that, uh, we've lost touch.

1035
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:39,390
為什麼? 怎麼了?
Why ? What's wrong ?

1036
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:44,900
我瘋狂嗜殺的渴求
My need to engage in homicidal behavior...

1037
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:47,770
無法遏制
on a massive scale cannot be corrected,

1038
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:50,860
但除此之外再沒什麼可以滿足我的渴求
but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.

1039
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:55,280
- 我們得好好談談 - 談什麼 帕特裏克?

Let's just avoid the issue, all right ? Now, are we having coffee ?

1044
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:11,800
我是認真的 我們已經完了 不是開玩笑

Uh, I don't think we should see each other anymore.

1046

可是你的朋友也是我的朋友 我的朋友也是你的朋友
But your friends are my friends and my friends are your friends.

1047
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:23,480
我想這是不可能的 你是不是有點...
I really don't think it would work. You have a little something...

1048
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:28,900
我知道你的朋友也是我的朋友 並且 呃 我都想過了
I know that your friends are my friends, and, uh... and I've thought about that.

1049

1052
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,080
- 你真冷血 - 不

1053

我很有人情味
I'm in touch with humanity.

1054

伊芙琳 我 呃 很抱歉 我只是 呃...
Evelyn, I'm, uh, sorry. I just, uh...

I know my behavior can be... erratic sometimes.

1059

你想讓我怎麼樣? 你到底想怎麼樣?
What do you want me to do ? What is it that you want ?

1060

If you really wanna do something for me, then stop making this scene right now.

01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:08,380
快給他們打電話 把電話給我 我來打 我會給你回電的
Just fucking call them. Give me the phone. I'll do it. I'll call you back.

1151
01:31:08,420 --> 01:31:11,840
面對現實吧 日本人在九十年代末 就會壟斷這個國家的大部分財富了
Face it. The Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.

1152
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:14,880
閉嘴 卡恩斯 他們別想
Shut up, Carnes. They will not.

1153
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:20,010
嗯 哈羅德 你聽到我的留言了嗎?
So, uh, Harold, did you get my message ?

1154
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:24,310
天哪 聽到了 真夠搞笑的 其實是你留的 對吧?
Jesus, yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it ?

1155
01:31:24,390 --> 01:31:28,150
- 是啊 自然是 - 巴特曼殺了艾倫還有三陪女
- Yeah, naturally. - Bateman killing Allen and the escort girls.

1156
01:31:28,230 --> 01:31:30,150
- 真有趣 夠好玩 - 你到底什麼意思?
- That's fabulous. That's rich. - What exactly do you mean ?

1157
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:34,650
你的留言啊 順便問一下 戴維斯·辛西婭好嗎? 你還和她約會 是嗎?
The message you left. By the way, Davis, how's Cynthia ? You're still seeing her, right ?

1158
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:36,820
等等 哈羅德 你什麼意思啊?
W-Wait, Harold. What do you mean ?

1159
01:31:36,910 --> 01:31:40,490
抱歉 沒什麼 很高興見到你
Excuse me. Nothing. It's good to see you.

1160
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:43,120
那是愛德華·塔沃斯嗎?
Is that Edward Towers?

1161
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,120
卡恩斯 等等 呃...
Carnes, wait. Uh...

1162
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:50,960
戴維斯 我不會到處亂講的 你的玩笑開得夠水平
Davis, I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone. Your joke was amusing.

1163
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:54,970
但是 朋友 你犯了個致命的錯誤
But come on, man. You had one fatal flaw:

1164
01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:57,130
巴特曼膽小如鼠
Bateman is such a dork.

1165
01:31:57,220 --> 01:32:00,850
無聊 沒骨氣 還沒肌肉
Such a boring, spineless lightweight.

1166
01:32:00,930 --> 01:32:04,770
如果你說是布瑞斯或者麥克德莫特幹的話... 不管怎麼說 很搞笑
Now, if you said Bryce or Mc Dermott. Otherwise, it was amusing.

1167
01:32:04,850 --> 01:32:07,440
請恕我失陪 我真的得走了
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must be going.

1168
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:11,020
等等 呃...站住
Wait. Uh... Stop.

1169
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,900
我真的幹了 卡恩斯
I did it, Carnes.

1170
01:32:14,990 --> 01:32:16,950
我殺了他
I killed him.

1171
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:19,570
我是帕特裏克·巴特曼
I'm Patrick Bateman.

1172
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:25,000
我把艾倫的頭砍下來了
I chopped Allen's fucking head off.

1173
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:31,250
我在留言裏說的都是實話
The whole message I left on your machine was true.

1174
01:32:31,330 --> 01:32:34,210
抱歉 我真的得走了
Excuse me. I really must be going now.

1175
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:37,470
不 不 聽著
No. No, listen.

1176
01:32:37,550 --> 01:32:40,050
你還不知道我是誰嗎?
Don't you know who I am ?

1177
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:42,890
我不是戴維斯 我就是帕特裏克·巴特曼
I'm not Davis. I'm Patrick Bateman.

1178
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:48,850
我們常在電話上聊天的
We talk on the phone all the time.

1179
01:32:48,890 --> 01:32:51,520
你認不出我來了嗎?
Don't you recognize me ?

1180
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:55,730
你是我的律師
You're my lawyer.

1181
01:32:55,820 --> 01:33:00,410
現在 卡恩斯 聽我說
Now, Carnes, listen.

1182
01:33:00,490 --> 01:33:02,740
給我仔細聽著
Listen very, very carefully.

1183
01:33:06,450 --> 01:33:09,790
我殺了保羅·艾倫
I killed Paul Allen,

1184
01:33:09,870 --> 01:33:11,880
我喜歡這麼幹
and I liked it.

1185
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:15,750
我說得再清楚不過了
I can't make myself any clearer.

1186
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:19,930
可這根本不可能 而且我也不覺得這有趣了
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.

1187
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:23,550
這絕不是編出來的 為什麼不可能?
It never was supposed to be. Why isn't it possible ?

1188
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:27,890
- 就是不可能 - 為什麼 你這個蠢貨?
- It's just not. - Why not, you stupid bastard ?

1189
01:33:27,930 --> 01:33:30,230
因為我和保羅·艾倫剛吃過兩次飯
Because I had dinner with Paul Allen...

1190
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:32,850
10天前在倫敦
twice in London just ten days ago.

1191
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:35,020
不 你...
No, you...

1192
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:40,610
- 不可能的 - 現在恕我失陪了
- didn't. Now, - if you'll excuse me.

1193
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:24,240
我們已經看到了相互猜忌的惡果
We've seen the results of that mistrust...

1194
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:27,830
各州政府間相互欺騙 相互交易
in the form of lies, provisions in the states.

1195
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:32,370
當我們意識到外交政策 不能光由一個委員會制定
We need to find a way to cooperate while realizing foreign policy...

1196
01:34:32,410 --> 01:34:34,830
我們必須找到一條相互合作的道路
can't be run by committee.

1197
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:37,380
而且我相信越來越多的人開始認識到
And I believe there's now the growing sense...

1198
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:41,380
相互合作會讓我們事半功倍
that we can accomplish more by cooperating.

1199
01:34:41,420 --> 01:34:45,390
而最終 這將是對已反伊朗事件面目出現的
And in the end, this maybe the eventual blessing in disguise...

1200
01:34:45,470 --> 01:34:47,470
混亂局面順利解決的最好祝福
to come out of the Iran-Contra mess.

1201
01:34:47,550 --> 01:34:51,180
他怎麼能這樣瞪著眼睛撒謊?
How can he lie like that ?

1202
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:53,230
- 他怎麼能放這種屁? - 放什麼屁?
- How can he pull that shit ? - What shit ?

1203
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:55,400
好了 你們在哪兒定了座?
Now, where do we have reservations at ?

1204
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:58,440
我不餓 可我想在什麼地方定個位子
I'm not really hungry, but I'd like to have reservations someplace.

1205
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:01,440
你怎麼能這麼...
How can you be so fucking,

1206
01:35:01,530 --> 01:35:04,030
我不知道該怎麼說 對此這麼冷血?
I don't know, cool about it ?

1207
01:35:04,110 --> 01:35:07,570
有些人生來冷血 我想
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.

1208
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:14,410
巴特曼?
Bateman ?

1209
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:19,800
- 你在樂什麼呀? - 我是個快樂的露營者
- What are you so fucking zany about ? - I'm just a happy camper.

1210
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:22,340
快樂的不得了!
Rockin' and a rollin' !

1211
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:24,470
哦 弟兄們 看呀
Oh, brother, look.

1212
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:29,600
他做出一副無辜的老頭的樣子 可是骨子裏...
He presents himself as this harmless old codger, but inside...

1213
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:32,270
可是骨子裏...
but inside...

1214
01:35:32,350 --> 01:35:35,270
可是骨子裏毫無所謂
But inside doesn't matter.

1215
01:35:35,310 --> 01:35:39,650
骨子裏怎麼樣? 相信嗎 布瑞斯 我們真在聽你說呢
Inside ? Believe or not, Bryce, we're actually listening to you.

1216
01:35:39,730 --> 01:35:42,320
來吧 巴特曼 你怎麼認為?
Come on, Bateman. What do you think ?

1217
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:49,530
- 無所謂 - 誰出的餿主意要的乾啤?
- Whatever. - Whose moronic idea was it to order dry beers ?

1218
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:51,620
我要蘇格蘭威士忌
I need a scotch.

1219
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:10,850
再沒有什麼障礙需要逾越
There are no more barriers to cross.

1220
01:36:10,930 --> 01:36:14,770
所有桀傲不馴者 精神錯亂者 作奸犯科者所共有的不安
All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane,

1221
01:36:14,850 --> 01:36:18,190
所有我犯過的罪行造成的傷害
the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused...

1222
01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:20,310
以及我對這一切的漠視
and my utter indifference toward it,

1223
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,980
我現在都成功逾越了
I have now surpassed.

1224
01:36:25,650 --> 01:36:28,570
我的痛苦恆久而深切
My pain is constant and sharp...

1225
01:36:28,660 --> 01:36:32,280
我不希望世界為任何人變得更好
and I do not hope for a better world for anyone.

1226
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:36,870
實際上 我要把我的痛苦加諸別人的身上
In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others.

1227
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,540
我不希望誰能倖免
I want no one to escape.

1228
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:43,550
可即使我坦言相陳
But even after admitting this,

1229
01:36:43,630 --> 01:36:45,800
我依然沒有得以疏解
there is no catharsis.

1230
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:48,630
我無法逃脫我的罪罰
My punishment continues to elude me...

1231
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:51,930
我也不能再更深地認識自我
and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself.

1232
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:55,770
我所說的再無新意可挖
No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling.

1233
01:36:55,850 --> 01:37:00,020
這番自白因此...毫無意義
This confession has meant... nothing.

1234
01:37:20,620 --> 01:37:22,950
" Abracadoo "

1235
01:37:23,050 --> 01:37:24,950
" I lose you "

1236
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:29,880
" We can't avoid the ciash "

1237
01:37:29,980 --> 01:37:31,880
" The big mistake "

1238
01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:36,480
" Now we're gonna pay and pay "

1239
01:37:37,950 --> 01:37:41,680
" I guess you know I never wanted anyone "

1240
01:37:41,790 --> 01:37:44,690
" More than you "

1241
01:37:44,790 --> 01:37:47,690
" Lived all our best times "

1242
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:53,420
" But I know you'll hoId your head up high "

1243
01:37:55,430 --> 01:37:58,410
" There's nothing we have to say "

1244
01:37:59,890 --> 01:38:04,260
" There is nothing in our eyes "

1245
01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:10,350
" But there's something in the air "

1246
01:38:10,490 --> 01:38:13,520
" Something I have to say "

1247
01:38:14,830 --> 01:38:18,730
" There's something in the air "

1248
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:21,590
Word " Who feels it "

1249
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:24,060
" Loves it "

1250
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:26,500
" Who knows it "

1251
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:28,590
" Shows it "

1252
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,770
" Who feeIs it "

1253
01:38:53,870 --> 01:38:56,360

1259
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:10,970
" Shows it "

1260
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:18,480
"Come on So what you gonna do with a broken heart "

1261
01:39:21,210 --> 01:39:23,640
" What you gonna do when they put you down "

1262
01:39:23,780 --> 01:39:26,010
" Move to the hip groove underground "

1263
01:39:26,110 --> 01:39:28,440
" What you gonna do when you miss your mark "

1264
01:39:28,550 --> 01:39:30,880
" Chill out Choose a brand- new start "

1265
01:39:30,980 --> 01:39:33,280
" How does it feel to be back on top "

1266
01:39:33,380 --> 01:39:36,010
