<i>President Trump reminded me
of why I first came to America.</i>

65
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:44,978
And I also recognize
that in America,

66
00:04:45,012 --> 00:04:50,017
there was such a thing
as an American dream.

67
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,252
India doesn't have a dream.

68

No other country has a dream.

69
00:04:54,988 --> 00:04:57,791
But this American dream
is a dream

70
00:04:57,824 --> 00:05:01,795
not just of economic opportunity
or success,

71
00:05:01,828 --> 00:05:04,297
but it's ultimately a dream
where you can be

72
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:06,867
the architect
of your own destiny.

73
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,969
America is a country
where you can be

74
00:05:09,002 --> 00:05:12,305
in the driver's seat
of your own life,

75
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:15,842
in which your destiny
is not given to you.

76

It is constructed by you.

86

225
00:12:59,105 --> 00:13:01,307
<i>Eastern Europe revolted.</i>

<i>its political ideology,
communism,</i>

228
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:12,685
<i>and its economic ideology,

229
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:15,588
<i>Russia still has
major problems,</i>

230
00:13:15,622 --> 00:13:17,557
<i>but it's better off.</i>

231
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,593
<i>India, too, is doing better.</i>

232
00:13:20,627 --> 00:13:22,695
<i>India has had a kind

233
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,431
<i>An evolution away

234
00:13:25,465 --> 00:13:27,600
And some of you remember,
your parents probably told you

235
00:13:27,634 --> 00:13:29,502
when you were younger,
"Listen, Johnny,

236

"you better eat your food,

237
00:13:31,604 --> 00:13:35,475
because there are millions
of starving people in India."

238
00:13:35,508 --> 00:13:37,577
Now, interestingly,

239
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,847
you probably don't say that
to your kids.

240
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,081
In fact, what you probably say
to your kids

241
00:13:42,115 --> 00:13:43,516
is something more like this:

242
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,819
"Johnny, you better study
really hard,

243
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:47,554
"'cause there are
millions of Indians

244
00:13:47,587 --> 00:13:49,155

245

<i>China is also doing better.</i>

246
00:13:57,597 --> 00:13:59,566
<i>China has done</i>

247
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:02,803

252
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:13,847
<i>by getting rid of socialism.</i>

253
00:14:16,884 --> 00:14:20,854

We don't have a major party,
certainly not

269
00:15:03,663 --> 00:15:05,733

It's funny you ask this,

<i>Even so, we have to

<i>Socialism is no longer

292
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,958
Raise your hand if gover...

294
00:16:10,496 --> 00:16:11,832
Okay.

295
00:16:11,865 --> 00:16:13,834
<i>It has now captured</i>

<i>First, they insist that

The old capitalism is gone.

304
00:16:34,888 --> 00:16:37,758
The new capitalism
is a cruel and evil system.

305
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:41,461
That ideology is not sustainable
and cannot be redeemed.

306
00:16:41,494 --> 00:16:44,998
We have a grotesque and immoral

307

314
00:17:03,382 --> 00:17:04,952

00:17:16,696 --> 00:17:18,431
If you have a problem
figuring out whether

320
00:17:18,464 --> 00:17:21,300
you're for me or Trump,
then you ain't Black.

321
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:26,405
Our-our country should be more
fearful, um, of-of white men.

322
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:28,341
But the thing of it is,
the blue wave

323
00:17:28,374 --> 00:17:31,310
is African American.

324
00:17:31,344 --> 00:17:34,081
It's white, it's Latino,
it's Asian, Pacific Islander.

325
00:17:34,114 --> 00:17:35,615
Yes!

326
00:17:35,648 --> 00:17:36,884
It is disabled.

327
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:39,519
- Yes! Yes!
- It is differently abled.

328
00:17:39,552 --> 00:17:41,789
- It is LGBTQ.
- Yes!

329
00:17:41,822 --> 00:17:43,791
It is made up of those
who've been told

330
00:17:43,824 --> 00:17:46,626
- that they are not worthy of being here.
- Yes!

331
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:48,494
It is comprised
of those who are documented

332
00:17:48,528 --> 00:17:50,463
- and undocumented.
- Yes!

333
00:17:50,496 --> 00:17:54,467
<i>For Marx, socialism
was about class division.</i>

334
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,070
<i>But for Democrats today,
the division in society</i>

335
00:17:57,104 --> 00:18:00,941
<i>isn't just between the
capitalists and the workers.</i>

336
00:18:00,974 --> 00:18:03,911
<i>It's also about
whites versus blacks,</i>

337
00:18:03,944 --> 00:18:06,013
<i>males versus females,</i>

338
00:18:06,046 --> 00:18:07,848
<i>straight versus gay,</i>

339
00:18:07,881 --> 00:18:09,883
<i>legal versus illegal.</i>

340
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:13,586
<i>Fourth, the left rejects
the authoritarian socialism</i>

341
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:15,923
<i>of Lenin, Stalin and Mao.</i>

342
00:18:15,956 --> 00:18:19,392
<i>It prefers
democratic socialism.</i>

343
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:22,062
<i>They want the same democracy
that we have</i>

344
00:18:22,095 --> 00:18:24,530
<i>in the political arena</i>

345
00:18:24,564 --> 00:18:27,067
<i>to extend
to the economic arena.</i>

346
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,036
Socialism is... everybody
has a seat at the table,

347
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:31,537
and everybody gets
a slice of the pie.

348
00:18:31,571 --> 00:18:34,373
Emphasis
in democratic socialism

349
00:18:34,407 --> 00:18:36,409
is on democracy.

350
00:18:39,612 --> 00:18:42,950
<i>We need to make
the moral case for capitalism</i>

351
00:18:42,983 --> 00:18:45,685
<i>and show that its rewards
are just.</i>

352
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:49,488
<i>We need to expose
the Scandinavian illusion.</i>

353
00:18:49,522 --> 00:18:51,792
<i>We must discredit
identity socialism</i>

354
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:54,094
<i>on its own terms.</i>

355
00:18:54,127 --> 00:18:58,397
<i>We need to show that socialism,
even democratic socialism,</i>

356
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:02,401
<i>inevitably leads
to misery and tyranny.</i>

<i>More than anything else,</i>

361
00:19:11,845 --> 00:19:13,546
<i>what defines the socialist left</i>

362
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:16,750
<i>is the promise of free stuff.</i>

363
00:19:16,783 --> 00:19:18,785
- Free. - Free. - Free.
- They should be free.

364
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:20,653
<i>They will receive</i>

Childcare for all
working families.

367

Cancel student loan debt.

368
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:29,428
- Free college.
- Tuition-free.

369
00:19:29,462 --> 00:19:30,797
Medicare for All.

370
00:19:30,831 --> 00:19:33,066
Any doctor they want,
any hospital they want.

371
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,935
<i>When the socialists say "free,"</i>

372
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:38,671
<i>what they mean is
someone else is going to pay.</i>

373
00:19:38,704 --> 00:19:41,742
<i>The left justifies
robbing Peter to pay Paul</i>

374
00:19:41,775 --> 00:19:43,977
<i>with the concept
of majority rule.</i>

375
00:19:44,011 --> 00:19:46,113
<i>But the very idea
that a majority,</i>

376
00:19:46,146 --> 00:19:50,616
<i>even a democratic majority,
can seize our money is unjust.</i>

377
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,519
<i>Should 51% of Americans
have the right</i>

378
00:19:53,552 --> 00:19:55,721
<i>to take away your possessions?</i>

379
00:19:55,756 --> 00:19:57,891
<i>Whether it's
a socialist dictator</i>

380
00:19:57,925 --> 00:20:01,094
<i>or a socialist majority
that takes your stuff,</i>

381
00:20:01,128 --> 00:20:03,897
<i>either way,
you're being robbed.</i>

382
00:20:03,931 --> 00:20:07,034
<i>And then we have
the Green New Deal.</i>

383
00:20:08,969 --> 00:20:11,238
<i>The world
is gonna end in 12 years</i>

384
00:20:11,271 --> 00:20:12,906
if we don't address
climate change.

385
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:17,778
I think it is the existential
threat to humanity.

386
00:20:17,811 --> 00:20:19,780
You know that movie
<i>The Day After Tomorrow?</i>

387
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:21,048
It's today.

388
00:20:24,284 --> 00:20:27,120
No challenge poses
a greater threat

389
00:20:27,154 --> 00:20:29,622
to future generations
than climate change.

390
00:20:29,655 --> 00:20:31,691
<i>Great news,
'cause the Obamas...</i>

391
00:20:31,724 --> 00:20:34,161
...are officially
Martha's Vineyard residents.

392
00:20:34,194 --> 00:20:37,563
<i>They just bought
a 6,900-square-foot home</i>

393
00:20:37,596 --> 00:20:40,901
<i>for $11.75 million.</i>

394
00:20:40,934 --> 00:20:45,638
<i>And here's the Bidens'
beach house in Rehoboth Beach.</i>

395
00:20:45,671 --> 00:20:49,242
<i>Clearly, they don't think
the coast will be underwater.</i>

396
00:20:51,011 --> 00:20:53,679
<i>What's the point
of this racket?</i>

397
00:20:53,713 --> 00:20:57,017
<i>It's to exploit
the politics of fear,</i>

398
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:01,721
<i>to get us to agree to things
that we wouldn't otherwise.</i>

399
00:21:01,755 --> 00:21:03,522
<i>Just like with coronavirus.</i>

400
00:21:03,556 --> 00:21:05,926
What's the opportunity...
to your question...

401
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:09,229
uh, for reimagining, uh,
a more progressive era

402
00:21:09,262 --> 00:21:11,832
as it relates to,
uh, capitalism?

403
00:21:11,865 --> 00:21:14,267
Only in America
does the president...

404
00:21:14,301 --> 00:21:16,269
when the president tweets
about "liberation"...

405
00:21:16,303 --> 00:21:18,138
does he mean "go back to work."

406
00:21:18,171 --> 00:21:20,073
I think a lot of people
should just say,

407
00:21:20,107 --> 00:21:22,541
"No, we're not going back
to that."

408
00:21:24,044 --> 00:21:26,847
<i>The best thing going
for the socialist agenda</i>

409
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,916
<i>is the moral anxiety
about capitalism.</i>

410
00:21:31,251 --> 00:21:34,553
<i>Does capitalism
allocate rewards fairly?</i>

411
00:21:40,227 --> 00:21:42,863
<i>The uniqueness of capitalism
is that it's based</i>

412
00:21:42,896 --> 00:21:45,332
<i>on entrepreneurs
who take chances.</i>

413
00:21:45,365 --> 00:21:48,301
<i>The test case we've chosen
just happens to be</i>

414
00:21:48,335 --> 00:21:50,603
<i>the president
of the United States.</i>

415
00:21:50,636 --> 00:21:54,941
<i>For most of his career, he was
the quintessential capitalist.</i>

416
00:21:54,975 --> 00:21:58,278
<i>The entrepreneur's psychology
is different than most.</i>

417
00:21:58,311 --> 00:22:02,049
<i>You can see this
from an incident in the 1990s</i>

418
00:22:02,082 --> 00:22:03,917
<i>when Trump was deeply in debt.</i>

419
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,219
Can you spare some change?
Anything helps.

420
00:22:10,123 --> 00:22:12,691
Can you spare some change, sir?
Anything helps.

421
00:22:12,725 --> 00:22:14,961
There you go, sir. God bless.

422
00:22:14,995 --> 00:22:18,065
- Isn't that just so sad?
- He's a beggar,

423
00:22:18,098 --> 00:22:22,035
but he's worth about
900 million more than me.

424
00:22:24,637 --> 00:22:26,106
<i>The deepest critique</i>

425
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:29,142
<i>of what capitalists
actually do comes from Marx.</i>

426
00:22:29,176 --> 00:22:32,946
<i>In his view, capitalists
supply only capital.</i>

427
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:35,015
<i>Other than that,
they do nothing.</i>

428
00:22:35,048 --> 00:22:39,820
<i>Therefore, a company's profits
belong entirely to its workers.</i>

429
00:22:39,853 --> 00:22:41,654
<i>Is Marx right?</i>

430
00:22:41,687 --> 00:22:44,723
<i>Let's consider
one of Trump's earliest deals.</i>

431
00:22:46,126 --> 00:22:48,395
<i>The starting point
of Donald Trump's career,</i>

432
00:22:48,428 --> 00:22:51,630
<i>he writes in his best-known</i>
<i>book</i> The Art of the Deal,

433
00:22:51,664 --> 00:22:54,968
<i>was his realization
of his own ambition.</i>

434
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:57,771
<i>My father did very well</i>

435
00:22:57,804 --> 00:23:01,775
<i>building low-income buildings
in Queens and Brooklyn,</i>

436
00:23:01,808 --> 00:23:05,178
<i>but I didn't want to be
in the same business as him.</i>

437
00:23:05,212 --> 00:23:07,214
<i>I wanted Manhattan.</i>

438
00:23:07,247 --> 00:23:12,152
<i>I was out to build
something monumental.</i>

439
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:17,157
<i>This was the '70s,
and the city was in the dumps.</i>

440
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:21,161
<i>But where people saw crisis,
I saw opportunity.</i>

441
00:23:21,194 --> 00:23:23,997
<i>And there were
four hotels for sale.</i>

442
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:26,233
<i>The fourth was in big trouble.</i>

443
00:23:26,266 --> 00:23:30,237
<i>The Commodore Hotel had been
losing money for years.</i>

444
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,873
<i>Nobody wanted to touch it.</i>

445
00:23:32,906 --> 00:23:37,077
<i>But I saw a superb location.</i>

446
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:42,415
<i>Millions of affluent people
pass by the location every day.</i>

447
00:23:42,449 --> 00:23:46,719
<i>The problem was the hotel,
not the location.</i>

448
00:23:50,423 --> 00:23:53,093
<i>Because the hotel was a loser,</i>

449
00:23:53,126 --> 00:23:57,731
<i>I was able to negotiate
the price down to ten million.</i>

450
00:24:01,434 --> 00:24:04,703
<i>At 27, did I have
ten million? No.</i>

451
00:24:04,738 --> 00:24:06,705
<i>Did I know how
to run a hotel? No.</i>

452
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,408
<i>But I had a vision.</i>

453
00:24:09,376 --> 00:24:12,812
<i>With my option to buy
the Commodore in hand,</i>

454
00:24:12,846 --> 00:24:18,485
<i>which didn't cost me a cent,
I sold my vision to Hyatt.</i>

455
00:24:18,518 --> 00:24:21,254
<i>I'd build it, they'd run it.</i>

456
00:24:22,756 --> 00:24:24,891
<i>Now that I had the option</i>

457
00:24:24,925 --> 00:24:27,327
<i>and the top hotel chain
in the country,</i>

458
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,729
<i>it was time to find the money</i>

459
00:24:29,763 --> 00:24:32,032
<i>for the hotel
and the renovations.</i>

460
00:24:32,065 --> 00:24:33,366
<i>I went to my father.</i>

461
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,136
<i>He refused to believe
I was serious.</i>

462
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:39,339
<i>So, with my option
to buy the Commodore,</i>

463
00:24:39,372 --> 00:24:41,841
<i>I went to the banks...
many of them.</i>

464
00:24:45,111 --> 00:24:47,747
<i>People fought me
on the renovation,</i>

465
00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:50,050
<i>saying we could save millions</i>

466
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:53,453
<i>by just refurbishing
the old Commodore,</i>

467
00:24:53,486 --> 00:24:56,756
<i>but why put lipstick on a pig?</i>

468
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,326
<i>No, this place needs
to be an event.</i>

469
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,163
<i>I even got pushback on
replacing the historical brick</i>

470
00:25:03,196 --> 00:25:06,499
<i>with highly reflective glass.</i>

471
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:08,969
<i>By choosing this glass,</i>

472
00:25:09,002 --> 00:25:12,138
<i>I've created four walls
of mirrors.</i>

473
00:25:12,172 --> 00:25:16,243
<i>Now, when you go
across 42nd Street and look up</i>

474
00:25:16,276 --> 00:25:19,779
<i>at the Grand Hyatt,
you see Grand Central,</i>

475
00:25:19,813 --> 00:25:21,281
<i>the Chrysler Building</i>

476
00:25:21,314 --> 00:25:25,785
<i>and all the other landmarks
this city has to offer.</i>

477
00:25:25,819 --> 00:25:30,857
<i>New York City, the Hyatt
and banks and myself</i>

478
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,160
<i>all benefitted from my deal.</i>

479
00:25:38,565 --> 00:25:40,100
<i>What's the drive, Donald,</i>

480
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:42,068
<i>that... you don't have
to do this anymore...</i>

481
00:25:42,102 --> 00:25:45,839
that keeps you wanting
to build more and more?

482
00:25:45,872 --> 00:25:47,374
It's a creative process,
Larry, and it's...

483
00:25:47,407 --> 00:25:49,509
it really gives you something
to do with your life,

484
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:51,945
and it's something that you can
feel fulfilled and proud of

485
00:25:51,978 --> 00:25:53,847
when you're finished,
if you do a good job.

486
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,448
<i>So, the one thing
that Marx said</i>

487
00:25:55,482 --> 00:25:57,584
<i>capitalists provide,
namely capital,</i>

488
00:25:57,617 --> 00:25:59,986
<i>they typically don't provide.</i>

489
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,289
<i>The other things that
capitalists do provide...</i>

490
00:26:02,322 --> 00:26:05,125
<i>vision, organization,
assumption of risk,</i>

491
00:26:05,158 --> 00:26:07,861
<i>marketing...
Marx ignored completely.</i>

492
00:26:07,894 --> 00:26:10,430
No one ever makes
a billion dollars.

493
00:26:10,463 --> 00:26:12,098
Mm-hmm. Hmm.

494
00:26:12,132 --> 00:26:14,968
You take a billion dollars.

495
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:17,304
<i>The most
successful entrepreneurs</i>

496
00:26:17,337 --> 00:26:21,374
<i>don't just supply wants and
needs; they anticipate them.</i>

497
00:26:21,408 --> 00:26:23,043
<i>Nobody wrote a letter
to Steve Jobs</i>

498
00:26:23,076 --> 00:26:26,246
<i>telling him to make a phone
that would do e-mail</i>

499
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:29,149
<i>and take photographs,
play music and show movies.</i>

500
00:26:29,182 --> 00:26:30,850
<i>He invented it and built it</i>

501
00:26:30,884 --> 00:26:34,387
<i>before we knew
we couldn't live without it.</i>

502
00:26:35,255 --> 00:26:38,258
<i>This is capitalism's
trump card.</i>

503
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:40,460
<i>It encourages
creativity and empathy,</i>

504
00:26:40,493 --> 00:26:42,462
<i>and then puts them
at the service</i>

505
00:26:42,495 --> 00:26:44,864
<i>of the wants and needs
of people.</i>

506
00:26:44,898 --> 00:26:48,001
<i>The inequality
the socialist left despises</i>

507
00:26:48,034 --> 00:26:50,870
<i>isn't created by entrepreneurs.</i>

508
00:26:50,904 --> 00:26:52,605
<i>It's created by us.</i>

509
00:26:54,607 --> 00:26:57,010
<i>The proud boast
of democratic socialism</i>

510
00:26:57,043 --> 00:27:00,213
<i>is that it puts the people
in charge of the economy.</i>

511
00:27:00,246 --> 00:27:05,251
<i>What control do you have over
the post office or the DMV?</i>

512
00:27:05,285 --> 00:27:08,321
<i>We vote in elections
every two or four years,</i>

513
00:27:08,355 --> 00:27:12,292
<i>but as consumers,
we exercise our choices daily,</i>

514
00:27:12,325 --> 00:27:14,294
<i>directly through the market.</i>

515
00:27:14,327 --> 00:27:17,364
<i>The free market is far more
reflective of popular consent</i>

516
00:27:17,397 --> 00:27:20,266
<i>than democratic socialism.</i>

517
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,635
<i>We don't have to extend
democracy</i>

518
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:25,071
<i>from the political
to the economic sphere,</i>

519
00:27:25,105 --> 00:27:27,240
<i>because we already have it.</i>

520
00:27:27,273 --> 00:27:29,242
<i>Capitalism, not socialism,</i>

521
00:27:29,275 --> 00:27:32,078
<i>is the true form
of social justice.</i>

522
00:27:37,484 --> 00:27:40,520
Black trans and cis women,
femmes,

523
00:27:40,553 --> 00:27:43,456
gender nonconformity
and nonbinary folk.

524
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,457
Gender fluid.

525
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:46,126
Ze, hir, hir.

526
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:46,926
Bigender.

527
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,095
Xem, xyr.

528
00:27:49,129 --> 00:27:52,031
- Agender.
- Intersectionality.

529
00:27:52,065 --> 00:27:54,934
<i>We turn to identity socialism,</i>

530
00:27:54,968 --> 00:27:58,338
<i>which aims to create
a majority coalition of victims</i>

531
00:27:58,371 --> 00:28:01,107
<i>based on sexual orientation,</i>

532
00:28:01,141 --> 00:28:03,209
<i>gender and race.</i>

533
00:28:03,243 --> 00:28:06,112
<i>Should our politics
be determined</i>

534
00:28:06,146 --> 00:28:09,582
<i>by our skin color
and our sex organs?</i>

535
00:28:09,616 --> 00:28:10,583
Ladies and gentlemen,

536
00:28:10,617 --> 00:28:12,285
please put your hands together

537
00:28:12,318 --> 00:28:15,422
to welcome comedian
and political activist

538
00:28:15,455 --> 00:28:18,391
Terrence K. Williams.

539
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:21,528
<i>First stop, Black Americans.</i>

540
00:28:21,561 --> 00:28:23,296
<i>I was in the White House.</i>

541
00:28:23,329 --> 00:28:24,564
That's called Black privilege.

542
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:30,003
<i>I was born in Oklahoma City.</i>

543
00:28:30,036 --> 00:28:31,671
I actually grew up
in foster care.

544
00:28:31,704 --> 00:28:33,540
My mother,
she was a single mother.

545
00:28:33,573 --> 00:28:35,074
She had nine children.

546
00:28:35,108 --> 00:28:36,676
There were
six different fathers,

547
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:39,379
and she was addicted
to cocaine.

548
00:28:39,412 --> 00:28:41,147
You are natural fodder
for the Democratic Party.

549
00:28:41,181 --> 00:28:42,315
- Yeah.
- How did they lose you?

550
00:28:42,348 --> 00:28:44,317
When I was Democrat,

551
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,419
I felt like the world
owed me everything.

552
00:28:46,453 --> 00:28:48,321
"You owe me this,
you owe me that."

553
00:28:48,354 --> 00:28:49,656
"Oh, I'm not working for that."

554
00:28:49,689 --> 00:28:51,491
But I figured out,
not working for stuff,

555
00:28:51,524 --> 00:28:53,159
you won't get nothing.

556
00:28:53,193 --> 00:28:55,595
So I lost
that mentality very quick,

557
00:28:55,628 --> 00:28:58,331
'cause I realized
that if you want something,

558
00:28:58,364 --> 00:29:00,400
you have to go out there
and get it.

559
00:29:00,433 --> 00:29:02,402
Where did you learn
the idea that,

560
00:29:02,435 --> 00:29:05,138
despite your hardships
and circumstances,

561
00:29:05,171 --> 00:29:07,340
this is America,
and this is a place

562
00:29:07,373 --> 00:29:10,376
where, if you've got something
to offer, you can make it?

563
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,078
- Who taught you that?
- Ms. Solomon.

564
00:29:12,111 --> 00:29:13,713
She was one
of my foster parents.

565
00:29:13,747 --> 00:29:17,751
She taught me that you can be
anything in this country

566
00:29:17,785 --> 00:29:20,420
as long as you get up

567
00:29:20,453 --> 00:29:22,722
and-and believe in yourself

568
00:29:22,756 --> 00:29:25,024
and stop blaming the world
for everything

569
00:29:25,058 --> 00:29:26,559
and making excuses.

570
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:29,395
Don't nobody owe you nothing.

571
00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:33,233
I don't owe you nothing.
I don't owe you nothing.

572
00:29:33,266 --> 00:29:35,635
You know who owe you something?

573
00:29:35,668 --> 00:29:37,337
You owe yourself!

574
00:29:40,206 --> 00:29:42,075
He's a very successful guy.
Say a few words.

575
00:29:42,108 --> 00:29:43,276
- Please. Hi.
- Thank you, President Trump.

576
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:45,144
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

577
00:29:45,178 --> 00:29:48,181
Yeah, let me... Yeah, this is
a little too tall for me.

578
00:29:49,817 --> 00:29:52,318
First of all, I just want to say

579
00:29:52,352 --> 00:29:55,388
I love
President Donald J. Trump.

580
00:29:55,421 --> 00:29:57,791
<i>Now, it seems
that you don't just like Trump;</i>

581
00:29:57,825 --> 00:29:59,158
you love Trump.

582
00:29:59,192 --> 00:30:01,394
Oh, I love
President Donald J. Trump.

583
00:30:01,427 --> 00:30:04,230
He didn't get
the majority of the Black vote,

584
00:30:04,264 --> 00:30:05,799
and he still won.

585
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:08,101
So he could've got in office

586
00:30:08,134 --> 00:30:10,103
and-and-and decided,
"You know,

587
00:30:10,136 --> 00:30:12,171
"I'm not gonna do anything
for the Black community,

588
00:30:12,205 --> 00:30:13,807
because they all
didn't vote for me."

589
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:16,543
But you know what,
it wasn't about that.

590
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,745
Where do you think we are

591
00:30:17,778 --> 00:30:19,279
in this country
in racial politics?

592
00:30:19,312 --> 00:30:22,348
Martin Luther King's dream
was for, simply,

593
00:30:22,382 --> 00:30:25,118
his Black children
could play at the playground

594
00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:26,820
with white children,

595
00:30:26,854 --> 00:30:30,123
could eat at the same table
as white children,

596
00:30:30,156 --> 00:30:32,392
and we are there now.

597
00:30:32,425 --> 00:30:36,396
Do you think that for the left,
division is a political weapon?

598
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:38,197
Especially when it comes
to Black people.

599
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:40,166
Because if they control
the Black community,

600
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:41,802
they control the Black vote.

601
00:30:53,847 --> 00:30:56,850
<i>Next stop, Hispanics.</i>

602
00:30:56,884 --> 00:31:00,486
<i>For the left,
it's all about the illegals.</i>

603
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,590
I'm going to, once again,

604
00:31:03,623 --> 00:31:05,658
legalize all the DACA students.

605
00:31:05,692 --> 00:31:07,527
These DACA students
are more American

606
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,762
than most Americans are.

607
00:31:08,796 --> 00:31:10,396
<i>Why would he say that?</i>

608
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,131
<i>Illegals can't vote.</i>

609
00:31:12,165 --> 00:31:15,869
<i>But the Democrats want
legal Hispanics, who can vote,</i>

610
00:31:15,903 --> 00:31:18,571
<i>to believe Trump is
anti-Hispanic</i>

611
00:31:18,605 --> 00:31:20,273
<i>and anti-immigrant.</i>

612
00:31:20,306 --> 00:31:22,675
<i>Not all Hispanics
are buying it.</i>

613
00:31:22,709 --> 00:31:25,879
Please give a warm welcome
to my friend, Rick Figueroa.

614
00:31:25,913 --> 00:31:27,881
<i>I discussed this</i>

615
00:31:27,915 --> 00:31:30,383
<i>with a prominent
Mexican American businessman</i>

616
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:32,786
<i>and activist, Rick Figueroa.</i>

617
00:31:34,654 --> 00:31:36,857
My mom worked 36 years
in a hospital kitchen.

618
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,458
She's my hero.

619
00:31:38,491 --> 00:31:40,794
She personified to me
the American dream.

620
00:31:40,828 --> 00:31:43,764
She was the one that
instilled principles in us.

621
00:31:43,797 --> 00:31:45,833
- What were they?
- "Get your butt out of bed

622
00:31:45,866 --> 00:31:46,934
and go to work."

623
00:31:46,967 --> 00:31:49,402
Number two is: "Don't expect
anybody to help you."

624
00:31:49,435 --> 00:31:52,672
Number three is:
"You help others when you can."

625
00:31:52,705 --> 00:31:54,942
Number four is:
"You pray every day."

626
00:31:54,975 --> 00:31:57,710
Number five is: "You find a
good woman and you marry her."

627
00:31:57,745 --> 00:31:59,445
Number six is:
"You raise godly kids."

628
00:31:59,479 --> 00:32:01,414
And number seven is: "You honor
God in everything you do."

629
00:32:01,447 --> 00:32:04,417
The principles that your mom
outlined seem very congruent

630
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,887
with what the Republican Party
stands for.

631
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,188
These things were established
in the Hispanic communities

632
00:32:09,222 --> 00:32:11,424
well before Republicans decided
to believe in them.

633
00:32:11,457 --> 00:32:15,561
What comes to mind when you
hear the word "socialism"?

634
00:32:15,595 --> 00:32:18,498
Fear. Capitalism gave me
the opportunity,

635
00:32:18,531 --> 00:32:19,532
created a lane.

636
00:32:19,565 --> 00:32:20,901
I don't see that in socialism.

637
00:32:20,934 --> 00:32:23,536
Where I am, coming
from the barrio of Bay City,

638
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:24,671
government housing,
youngest of eight,

639
00:32:24,704 --> 00:32:27,775
there was nothing exceptional
academically about me,

640
00:32:27,808 --> 00:32:30,710
but there was a constant hunger
to do more and want more.

641
00:32:30,744 --> 00:32:33,346
My goal was to have a house
with central air and heat.

642
00:32:33,379 --> 00:32:35,381
Then we had that. Then I wanted
a little bigger house.

643
00:32:35,415 --> 00:32:37,417
Then I wanted a family,
and I wanted a yard

644
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,585
for my kids to play in,
and I wanted them

645
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:41,955
to go to college, and I wanted
my wife and I to retire.

646
00:32:41,989 --> 00:32:45,224
The lane was created
by capitalism to do that.

647
00:32:45,258 --> 00:32:46,860
A Democrat would say,

648
00:32:46,894 --> 00:32:51,230
"But, Rick, uh, wouldn't you
have felt better along the way

649
00:32:51,264 --> 00:32:55,334
"if you had known, hey,
I'll have my college paid for,

650
00:32:55,368 --> 00:32:57,270
uh, I'll have free health care?"

651
00:32:57,303 --> 00:32:59,773
Why would you rather
not have driven in that lane?

652
00:32:59,807 --> 00:33:01,842
My son, I tell him
to go feed the cows,

653
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:03,443
and they always whine
about feeding cows.

654
00:33:03,476 --> 00:33:04,845
"Dad, it's too cold.
It's too hot.

655
00:33:04,878 --> 00:33:06,479
I don't want to feed the cows."

656
00:33:06,512 --> 00:33:08,782
When he had his own cow,
I never heard him complain

657
00:33:08,816 --> 00:33:10,951
one bit about it,
because it was his cow.

658
00:33:10,984 --> 00:33:13,486
When something's given to you,
you don't appreciate it.

659
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,856
I think you typically
just take it for granted.

660
00:33:15,889 --> 00:33:17,724
The Latino community embodies

661
00:33:17,758 --> 00:33:20,626
the pioneering spirit
of America.

662
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,696
We're a nation
that loves adventure...

663
00:33:23,731 --> 00:33:25,999
and you love adventure...

664
00:33:26,033 --> 00:33:28,001
that celebrates risk-taking

665
00:33:28,035 --> 00:33:30,369
and that embraces
faith and family

666
00:33:30,403 --> 00:33:32,672
as the true center
of American life.

667
00:33:32,705 --> 00:33:35,708
Vote them out! Vote them out!

668
00:33:35,743 --> 00:33:37,610
Vote them out! Vote them out!

669
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:38,979
<i>Next stop, women.</i>

670
00:33:39,012 --> 00:33:41,714
<i>On the surface,
this is about protecting women</i>

671
00:33:41,749 --> 00:33:43,050
<i>and the #MeToo movement.</i>

672
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:44,952
We believe survivors!

673
00:33:44,985 --> 00:33:46,686
We believe survivors!

674
00:33:46,719 --> 00:33:50,824
Brett's assault on me
drastically altered my life.

675
00:33:50,858 --> 00:33:54,862
<i>Christine Blasey Ford
had a different agenda.</i>

676
00:33:54,895 --> 00:33:57,697
He will always have an asterisk
next to his name.

677
00:33:57,731 --> 00:33:59,665
When he takes a scalpel
to <i>Roe v. Wade,</i>

678
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:01,434
we will know who he is.

679
00:34:01,467 --> 00:34:03,937
We know his character,
and we know what motivates him,

680
00:34:03,971 --> 00:34:05,939
and that is important.

681
00:34:05,973 --> 00:34:07,607
It is important that we know,

682
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,409
and that was part
of what motivated Christine.

683
00:34:10,443 --> 00:34:12,880
No means no! No means no!

684
00:34:12,913 --> 00:34:15,816
<i>For them, too,
it's all about abortion.</i>

685
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:19,753
<i>It's all about protecting</i>
Roe v. Wade.

686
00:34:19,787 --> 00:34:23,689
<i>In the church
of gender identity politics,</i>

687
00:34:23,723 --> 00:34:27,360
<i>abortion has become
the ultimate sacrament.</i>

688
00:34:29,362 --> 00:34:32,900
<i>My daughter Danielle is the
author of the forthcoming book</i>

689
00:34:32,933 --> 00:34:36,804
The Choice:
The Abortion Divide in America.

690
00:34:36,837 --> 00:34:40,073
<i>How radical are the Democrats
on this issue today?</i>

691
00:34:40,107 --> 00:34:43,010
You can be nine months pregnant,

692
00:34:43,043 --> 00:34:45,611
dilating, going into labor,
and get an abortion,

693
00:34:45,645 --> 00:34:47,848
and the Democrats
really celebrate that.

694
00:34:47,881 --> 00:34:50,650
<i>New York passing
a sweeping abortion law,</i>

695
00:34:50,683 --> 00:34:51,985
<i>allowing many abortions</i>

696
00:34:52,019 --> 00:34:55,388
<i>up until the day
of the baby's birth.</i>

697
00:34:59,993 --> 00:35:02,095
<i>They lit up
the One World Trade Center pink</i>

698
00:35:02,129 --> 00:35:04,530
<i>to celebrate this...
as women's empowerment,</i>

699
00:35:04,564 --> 00:35:06,632
<i>women's freedom,
abortion is health care.</i>

700
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:10,037
How do we know that
the contents of a woman's womb

701
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,139
are, you might say, not her own?

702
00:35:12,172 --> 00:35:14,607
I'm in my 20s,
so I see my friends,

703
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,910
let's say, post on social media
that they're pregnant,

704
00:35:16,944 --> 00:35:19,146
or they'll post a photo
of their ultrasound,

705
00:35:19,179 --> 00:35:21,714
people will comment on it,
and so we can see

706
00:35:21,748 --> 00:35:23,851
that when you step
outside of the abortion debate,

707
00:35:23,884 --> 00:35:26,419
you can see that everyone knows
that it's a child.

708
00:35:26,452 --> 00:35:28,721
They know that, "Oh, look,
it's a family of three now."

709
00:35:28,755 --> 00:35:31,557
So, only when you go
into the abortion debate

710
00:35:31,591 --> 00:35:34,660
do people say, "Oh, no, no, no,
this is a 'cluster of cells.'"

711
00:35:34,694 --> 00:35:37,064
But the reality
of what it means to be pregnant

712
00:35:37,097 --> 00:35:38,531
is "with child."

713
00:35:40,566 --> 00:35:43,036
<i>Even if you look
at first-trimester abortions,</i>

714
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,873
the baby has a head, a nose,

715
00:35:45,906 --> 00:35:48,608
a face, fingers, toes,
a heartbeat,

716
00:35:48,641 --> 00:35:50,744
and we also know
that it even feels pain,

717
00:35:50,777 --> 00:35:52,980
because it secretes things
like cortisol,

718
00:35:53,013 --> 00:35:56,449
hormones that we also secrete
when we're under duress.

719
00:35:57,851 --> 00:36:00,053
<i>Should my
right to life be dependent</i>

720
00:36:00,087 --> 00:36:03,190
on whether I am
a wanted child or not?

721
00:36:03,223 --> 00:36:05,192
Your human rights are intrinsic.

722
00:36:05,225 --> 00:36:07,127
Your value comes from the fact

723
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,097
that you're a human being,
and I think we should all

724
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,531
be able to support
basic human rights,

725
00:36:12,565 --> 00:36:14,201
which is the right to life,

726
00:36:14,234 --> 00:36:16,469
the right, literally,
just to be born.

727
00:36:16,502 --> 00:36:18,038
My body, my choice!

728
00:36:18,071 --> 00:36:20,173
My body, my choice!

729
00:36:20,207 --> 00:36:22,009
My body, my choice!

730
00:36:22,042 --> 00:36:24,077
<i>What about the right to choose?</i>

731
00:36:24,111 --> 00:36:26,980
My choice ends at the point
where it reaches you.

732
00:36:27,014 --> 00:36:29,615
The left likes to talk
about pro-choice.

733
00:36:29,649 --> 00:36:30,884
And the choice to do what?

734
00:36:30,918 --> 00:36:32,585
And that is the choice to kill.

735
00:36:32,618 --> 00:36:34,855
It's the choice
to take another's life,

736
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:36,890
<i>a life that is not your own.</i>

737
00:36:42,662 --> 00:36:45,065
<i>Next, sexual orientation.</i>

738
00:36:45,098 --> 00:36:49,036
<i>We've had gays, lesbians
and bisexuals for centuries.</i>

739
00:36:49,069 --> 00:36:54,107
<i>What's new is that this
has now become an ideology.</i>

740
00:36:54,141 --> 00:36:56,877
<i>I spoke with Scott Presler,
a gay conservative</i>

741
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:00,147
<i>who organizes cleanups
in major cities.</i>

742
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,816
Making Baltimore beautiful...
that was the goal,

743
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:05,651
as trash cleanup efforts
continued today

744
00:37:05,685 --> 00:37:06,787
<i>in West Baltimore.</i>

745
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,654
<i>Conservative activist
Scott Presler</i>

746
00:37:08,688 --> 00:37:10,157
<i>put the all call
on his social media.</i>

747
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:13,492
<i>There is a common thread
among many of the volunteers.</i>

748
00:37:14,995 --> 00:37:17,496
Scott, here we are
in Downtown Houston.

749
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,833
It's the Black neighborhood,
it's a brown neighborhood.

750
00:37:19,866 --> 00:37:22,769
What are you, a...

751
00:37:22,803 --> 00:37:26,039
white, gay conservative,
doing here?

752
00:37:26,073 --> 00:37:28,241
I feel a responsibility.
I'm a private citizen.

753
00:37:28,275 --> 00:37:31,845
You know, we don't need
the big government to do this.

754
00:37:31,878 --> 00:37:34,081
I'm gonna come in and do the job

755
00:37:34,114 --> 00:37:37,516
that deep Democratic cities
like Houston

756
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,785
haven't been doing,

757
00:37:38,819 --> 00:37:40,653
and sweep up trash
in an act of love.

758
00:37:40,686 --> 00:37:42,823
- What cities have you been to?
- Well, we started

759
00:37:42,856 --> 00:37:47,693
in Baltimore city, and we
picked up 29 tons of trash.

760
00:37:47,728 --> 00:37:50,297
Then we went to
Los Angeles, California,

761
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:53,166
and picked up 50 tons of trash.

762
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,269
We went to Chicago
on 63rd Street...

763
00:37:56,303 --> 00:37:58,271
dangerous territory.

764
00:37:58,305 --> 00:38:00,107
<i>Now, trash is a symbol</i>

765
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,275
<i>for a lot that's gone wrong
in these neighborhoods, right?</i>

766
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:03,709
<i>Broken families...</i>

767
00:38:03,744 --> 00:38:05,078
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>...uh, high crime rates,</i>

768
00:38:05,112 --> 00:38:06,847
<i>terrible schools.</i>

769
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,282
A lot of money has been spent
to fix these places up.

770
00:38:09,316 --> 00:38:11,118
Why do you think
they've never gotten fixed?

771
00:38:11,151 --> 00:38:13,120
I think, quite frankly,
the Democrats don't want

772
00:38:13,153 --> 00:38:16,957
to solve the problem, because
they want to be the solution.

773
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,291
And look at what we're doing.

774
00:38:18,325 --> 00:38:20,227
Private citizens
coming together,

775
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,796
putting on our work boots,
rolling up our sleeves

776
00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:24,297
and doing the work ourselves.

777
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:25,799
The-the conservative
philosophy.

778
00:38:25,832 --> 00:38:27,566
- Yes, absolutely.
- Do you feel comfortable

779
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,169
calling yourself
a gay conservative?

780
00:38:29,202 --> 00:38:30,603
I'm a bleeding-heart
conservative

781
00:38:30,636 --> 00:38:31,805
who happens to be gay.

782
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:35,075
I don't let my identity
define me.

783
00:38:35,108 --> 00:38:39,046
So, the Democrats have created
this game of identity politics,

784
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:42,215
and they have, uh,
the Oppression Olympics,

785
00:38:42,249 --> 00:38:44,951
where if you're not Black

786
00:38:44,985 --> 00:38:47,054
or gay or a woman

787
00:38:47,087 --> 00:38:50,157
or disabled, then it's
almost like you don't exist.

788
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,758
I came out as gay

789
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:54,327
after the Pulse nightclub
terrorist attack.

790
00:38:54,361 --> 00:38:56,129
I want to make sure that the
people coming into our country

791
00:38:56,163 --> 00:38:58,697
don't want to murder me...
I feel like that's

792
00:38:58,732 --> 00:39:00,566
a pretty low bar to set,
don't you think?

793

<i>Presler's fear points

800
00:39:23,757 --> 00:39:25,325

00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:27,327
And you're based in Canada.

802
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,629
You're a member
of the Liberal Party.

803
00:39:31,965 --> 00:39:34,401
You have been what could be
loosely called

805

<i>who Mr. Bender represented
in settlement negotiations.</i>

808
00:39:45,112 --> 00:39:47,280
<i>I'd like to talk
to you a little bit</i>

809
00:39:47,314 --> 00:39:50,817
<i>about the configuration
of politics in the Middle East.</i>

810
00:39:50,851 --> 00:39:54,421
<i>The Iranian regime
actually believes that there is</i>

811
00:39:54,454 --> 00:39:56,655
no coexistence with America.

812
00:39:56,689 --> 00:39:59,759
<i>The path of the Islamic sharia
is the only way.</i>

813
00:39:59,793 --> 00:40:01,394
<i>And that leads to a clash</i>

814
00:40:01,428 --> 00:40:05,132
<i>between the pro-American states
in the Gulf region</i>

815
00:40:05,165 --> 00:40:07,167
<i>and the Iranian regime.</i>

816
00:40:08,168 --> 00:40:11,138
The Iranian government controls
the government of Qatar.

817
00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:14,741
The Iranians don't pay,
so they use Qatari money

818
00:40:14,774 --> 00:40:17,310
to pay whomever
they need to pay.

819
00:40:17,344 --> 00:40:20,713
Now, you have had some
experiences which, I think,

820
00:40:20,747 --> 00:40:23,884
remarkably suggest that,
uh, not only are

821
00:40:23,917 --> 00:40:27,053
the Iranians and the Qataris
trying to influence

822
00:40:27,087 --> 00:40:30,123
the politics
of the Middle East over there,

823
00:40:30,157 --> 00:40:33,293
but they're actually
trying to influence

824
00:40:33,326 --> 00:40:35,395
American politics over here.

825
00:40:35,428 --> 00:40:37,696
During my meetings with
the top officials in Qatar

826
00:40:37,731 --> 00:40:39,698
<i>to discuss potential, uh,</i>

827
00:40:39,733 --> 00:40:41,768
<i>major investments
in North America,</i>

828
00:40:41,801 --> 00:40:45,172
<i>and they reiterated the fact
that they produce more gas</i>

829
00:40:45,205 --> 00:40:47,107
<i>and oil than any other country
in the region.</i>

830
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,875
<i>So they don't really need</i>

831
00:40:48,909 --> 00:40:50,477
<i>the return
on their investments.</i>

832
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:53,712
However, their investments
in North America

833
00:40:53,747 --> 00:40:56,082
is a powerful weapon
to influence the elections

834
00:40:56,116 --> 00:41:00,253
and see to it that the outcome
will fit the Iranian interest.

835
00:41:00,287 --> 00:41:02,455
- Which is to defeat Trump.
- To defeat Trump.

836
00:41:02,489 --> 00:41:03,990
They said,
"We are looking forward

837
00:41:04,024 --> 00:41:06,026
"to the defeat of Trump.

838
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:08,728
"And then we will see
the first Friday prayer

839
00:41:08,762 --> 00:41:10,797
"taking place
in the White House,

840
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:14,167
"uh, as a symbol
of our victory and, uh,

841
00:41:14,201 --> 00:41:17,304
<i>the rise
of the Muslim Brotherhood."</i>

842
00:41:17,337 --> 00:41:19,339
<i>Her name is Ilhan Omar.</i>

843
00:41:19,372 --> 00:41:20,807
<i>She's a former refugee
from Somalia.</i>

844
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,075
<i>She's a Muslim American,</i>

845
00:41:22,108 --> 00:41:25,378
<i>and she is now the Minnesota
State House Representative.</i>

846
00:41:25,412 --> 00:41:28,114
<i>What did the Qataris
tell you about her?</i>

847
00:41:28,148 --> 00:41:30,350
They refer to her as
"Sister Ilhan," and to them,

848
00:41:30,383 --> 00:41:33,820
she is the jewel
of their political crown.

849
00:41:33,853 --> 00:41:35,822
And, uh,
they told me face-to-face

850
00:41:35,855 --> 00:41:37,257
that they financed her.

851
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,259
<i>Heavily financed her.</i>

852
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:41,261
<i>And they groomed her.</i>

853
00:41:41,294 --> 00:41:44,030
And they said, "You don't
need to worry about, uh,

854
00:41:44,064 --> 00:41:46,066
skeletons being found,
because the media will bury it."

855
00:41:46,099 --> 00:41:47,500
We've seen more than
six different scandals

856
00:41:47,534 --> 00:41:49,302
involving Ilhan Omar.

857
00:41:49,336 --> 00:41:51,104
- Nobody investigated her.
- Campaign finance violations,

858
00:41:51,137 --> 00:41:53,840
- for example.
- Exactly.

859
00:41:53,873 --> 00:41:55,875
How do they control her?

860
00:41:55,909 --> 00:41:58,378
Her weakness: money and sex.

861
00:41:58,411 --> 00:42:02,182
How do they actually use
their financial leverage

862
00:42:02,215 --> 00:42:06,987
to either influence or control
people like Ilhan Omar?

863
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,456
America is a-a country
of law and rules.

864
00:42:09,489 --> 00:42:12,058
We do it indirectly,
and there are always loopholes

865
00:42:12,092 --> 00:42:14,361
that allows us to,
uh, get through.

866
00:42:14,394 --> 00:42:16,830
I actually brought up,
"What about the media?"

867
00:42:16,863 --> 00:42:18,999
They said, "I think
we're almost at the top of,

868
00:42:19,032 --> 00:42:21,067
"uh, controlling that.

869
00:42:21,101 --> 00:42:23,169
"And we have
a lot of journalists

870
00:42:23,203 --> 00:42:24,938
<i>who are on our payroll."</i>

871
00:42:24,971 --> 00:42:27,407
<i>You're actually saying
that these Islamic governments</i>

872
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,943
are making direct
monetary payments

873
00:42:29,976 --> 00:42:31,411
to members
of the mainstream media?

874
00:42:31,444 --> 00:42:33,246
Correct.

875
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,148
These are not remote figures,

876
00:42:35,181 --> 00:42:37,417
but people
in mainstream institutions?

877
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:39,886
- <i>That is correct.
- What you're saying is that</i>

878
00:42:39,919 --> 00:42:41,988
there is serious
Middle Eastern...

879
00:42:42,022 --> 00:42:45,358
and specifically
radical Islamic... intervention

880
00:42:45,392 --> 00:42:48,395
coming from abroad
into U.S. politics.

881
00:42:48,428 --> 00:42:50,964
Exactly. And I think
it's more, uh, dangerous

882
00:42:50,997 --> 00:42:54,301
than the so-called
Russian collusion.

883
00:42:57,203 --> 00:42:59,105
<i>But doesn't identity socialism</i>

884
00:42:59,139 --> 00:43:02,575
<i>and radical Islam
make strange bedfellows?</i>

885
00:43:02,609 --> 00:43:06,246
<i>I raised the question
with Imam Mohammad Tawhidi.</i>

886
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:08,381
<i>Any Islamist will tell you</i>

887
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:11,051
that America
is the enemy of Islam.

888
00:43:11,084 --> 00:43:13,286
<i>They're chanting "death
to America" every single day.</i>

889
00:43:15,488 --> 00:43:16,956
I did it for seven years.

890
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:18,391
"Death to America,
death to Israel."

891
00:43:22,162 --> 00:43:27,167
What is the fundamentalist
and jihadi agenda for America?

892
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,537
The future of America
has to be Muslim.

893
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:32,038
So here's a paradox.

894
00:43:32,072 --> 00:43:34,074
In America,
we have a political left.

895
00:43:34,107 --> 00:43:35,642
It's a progressive left.

896
00:43:35,675 --> 00:43:37,510
As you know,
it's sexually permissive.

897
00:43:37,544 --> 00:43:39,579
And this political movement

898
00:43:39,612 --> 00:43:44,584
appears strangely allied
with radical Islam.

899
00:43:44,617 --> 00:43:46,219
Can you explain this?

900
00:43:46,252 --> 00:43:50,423
When I was an extremist,
Islamist, fundamentalist,

901
00:43:50,457 --> 00:43:52,058
I would only vote left.

902
00:43:52,092 --> 00:43:55,328
- Why is that?
- I saw them as very stupid.

903
00:43:55,362 --> 00:43:57,230
I would fear the conservatives,

904
00:43:57,263 --> 00:43:59,599
because they come
with principle.

905
00:43:59,632 --> 00:44:02,535
That's not someone
they can brainwash.

906
00:44:02,569 --> 00:44:06,206
But the left,
I know they have no values

907
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:08,508
and no principles to begin with.

908
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:10,677
I dare you to find
one Islamic extremist

909
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:12,412
that votes for Donald Trump.

910
00:44:12,445 --> 00:44:14,247
Would never do it.

911
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,950
They'd give their vote
to the leftist

912
00:44:16,983 --> 00:44:19,119
who wants to, uh, run around

913
00:44:19,152 --> 00:44:22,389
in-in, uh, Pride parades and...

914
00:44:22,422 --> 00:44:24,124
Islamic extremists
are against gays

915
00:44:24,157 --> 00:44:26,493
and homosexuals
and-and transgenders,

916
00:44:26,526 --> 00:44:30,497
but they want the left to go
and get busy with that.

917
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:33,299
They want them, "Go, go,
go speak about the climate.

918
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:35,468
"Go, go.
Go speak about abortion.

919
00:44:35,502 --> 00:44:37,570
Go, go kill yourselves.
Go, go do that."

920
00:44:37,604 --> 00:44:40,140
Ilhan Omar, she's fighting
for abortion rights

921
00:44:40,173 --> 00:44:41,941
and all the other...
"My body, my choice."

922
00:44:41,975 --> 00:44:44,477
Yes, go do that, go do it,
but would she have an abortion?

923
00:44:44,511 --> 00:44:47,614
Never. Never.

924
00:44:47,647 --> 00:44:51,351
Would she kill a Muslim
in her stomach? Never.

925
00:44:51,384 --> 00:44:52,519
<i>What's your take on her?</i>

926
00:44:52,552 --> 00:44:54,387
<i>Fundamentalist,</i>

927
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:58,258
extremist, Islamist,
jihadi ideology,

928
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:00,160
a threat to national security.

929
00:45:00,193 --> 00:45:02,495
- ISIS with lipstick.
- Now, would it be fair

930
00:45:02,529 --> 00:45:04,330
to say that
what Ilhan Omar wants

931
00:45:04,364 --> 00:45:08,334
is for all of America
to look like her community?

932
00:45:08,368 --> 00:45:10,336
Without a doubt.

933
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:12,205
Firstly, the Muslims

in America?

948
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:52,078
Votes and common interest.

949
00:45:52,111 --> 00:45:54,314

are delivering the votes...

950
00:45:54,347 --> 00:45:55,783
- Yes. Yes.
- ...to their leaders.

951
00:45:55,816 --> 00:45:57,751
And-and what do the socialists

952
00:45:57,785 --> 00:46:00,086

give in exchange?

953

will Americans become strangers

associate the Nordic model
with some sort of socialism.

973
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:28,341
Therefore, I would like
to make one thing clear.

974
00:47:28,374 --> 00:47:32,445
Uh, Denmark is, uh, far from
a socialist-planned economy.

975

is that we tax consumption.

We have a 25% V.A.T.
consumption tax in Sweden,

- "Safety."

how can people rise

is this... the closeness
of this gun parallel.

1073

the demonization of the rich.</i>

the future looks bleak.</i>

1090
00:52:45,058 --> 00:52:46,793
<i>Over the past 40 years,</i>

1091
00:52:46,827 --> 00:52:48,862
<i>he's built up a thriving
cattle and dairy operation</i>

1092
00:52:48,896 --> 00:52:50,864
<i>in western Venezuela.</i>

1093
00:52:50,898 --> 00:52:52,431
<i>But this month,</i>

1094
00:52:52,465 --> 00:52:55,701
<i>Hugo Chávez's government
expropriated 30 farms</i>

1095
00:52:55,736 --> 00:52:58,805
<i>in the region,
and his could be next.</i>

1096
00:53:00,173 --> 00:53:01,942
I developed all of this

1097
00:53:01,975 --> 00:53:04,011
using my own intelligence
and my own labor.

1098
00:53:04,044 --> 00:53:05,711
And now that everything
is going well,

1099
00:53:05,746 --> 00:53:07,713
the government comes along
and steals it from me.

1100
00:53:07,748 --> 00:53:10,217
Strips me of my land
and my ideas.

1101
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:12,652
There are more
than 100 people working here.

1102
00:53:12,685 --> 00:53:13,987
If there is an expropriation,

1103
00:53:14,021 --> 00:53:15,789
we're all going to be
out of work.

1104
00:53:15,822 --> 00:53:17,824
Let's turn
to a different parallel.

1105
00:53:17,858 --> 00:53:20,093
And this is the war
on fossil fuels.

1106
00:53:20,127 --> 00:53:23,096
<i>How is it possible,
in a country that is so rich</i>

1107
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:24,865
in resources,
that you would have

1108
00:53:24,898 --> 00:53:26,666
<i>electricity blackouts</i>

1109
00:53:26,699 --> 00:53:28,936
<i>and gas lines for people
to fill up the car?</i>

1110
00:53:28,969 --> 00:53:30,503
<i>Well, first of all,</i>

1111
00:53:30,536 --> 00:53:33,673
Hugo Chávez brought all
his bureaucrats to take over.

1112
00:53:33,706 --> 00:53:37,778
They had no idea how to run
an oil company whatsoever.

1113
00:53:37,811 --> 00:53:39,545
The American
and British oil companies

1114
00:53:39,578 --> 00:53:42,682
that were in Venezuela
were basically run out.

1115
00:53:42,715 --> 00:53:45,252
All the engineers, everybody
who knew how to do the job,

1116
00:53:45,285 --> 00:53:47,821
<i>they had to leave the country.</i>

1117
00:53:47,854 --> 00:53:50,523
<i>For fossil fuels,
Hugo Chávez hated them.</i>

1118
00:53:50,556 --> 00:53:53,860
<i>And he decided to do
hydro energy instead.</i>

1119
00:53:53,894 --> 00:53:56,730
<i>Venezuela had
many, many droughts.</i>

1120
00:53:56,763 --> 00:53:59,066
<i>Therefore, caused
rolling blackouts.</i>

1121
00:54:04,271 --> 00:54:07,506
<i>Another parallel
is the left-wing militants.</i>

1122
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,109
<i>There is a group of criminals</i>

1123
00:54:09,142 --> 00:54:10,643
- <i>called</i> colectivos...
- <i>Mm.</i>

1124
00:54:10,676 --> 00:54:13,013
<i>...in Venezuela,
and they're very similar</i>

1125
00:54:13,046 --> 00:54:15,182
<i>to our antifa people here.</i>

1126
00:54:15,215 --> 00:54:16,615
Colectivos <i>got support</i>

1127
00:54:16,649 --> 00:54:17,918
<i>from the government
of Hugo Chávez</i>

1128
00:54:17,951 --> 00:54:20,087
<i>to work as
the government's strong arm,</i>

1129
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,156
<i>intimidating and even killing
members of the opposition.</i>

1130
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:24,825
Anybody raise their voice

1131
00:54:24,858 --> 00:54:28,095
against certain ideologies
of the government,

1132
00:54:28,128 --> 00:54:30,263
<i>they get terrorized
by this group.</i>

1133
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:39,072
I grew up in
a socialist country, India,

1134
00:54:39,106 --> 00:54:40,841
which moved toward capitalism.

1135
00:54:40,874 --> 00:54:43,176
And so,
India's doing a lot better,

1136
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:45,746
but Venezuela, which moved
in the opposite direction,

1137
00:54:45,779 --> 00:54:47,848
from a capitalist society
to socialism,

1138
00:54:47,881 --> 00:54:49,816
<i>seems to have crumbled.</i>

1139
00:54:51,752 --> 00:54:53,619
<i>This is how Venezuelans spend</i>

1140
00:54:53,652 --> 00:54:55,222
<i>most of their time now:</i>

1141
00:54:55,255 --> 00:54:57,891
<i>in line not for luxuries
but basics.</i>

1142
00:55:04,131 --> 00:55:07,167
I moved, uh, from Venezuela
to the Rio Grande Valley,

1143
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,103
and I thought I was moving
into a third-world country

1144
00:55:10,137 --> 00:55:13,639
after coming from Venezuela,
because it was so wealthy.

1145
00:55:13,672 --> 00:55:16,843
We had everything
we needed and wanted.

1146
00:55:16,877 --> 00:55:18,211
It seems there's
one class of people

1147
00:55:18,245 --> 00:55:20,213
who are living pretty well.
Who are they?

1148
00:55:20,247 --> 00:55:21,982
They're called the Chavistas.

1149
00:55:27,754 --> 00:55:28,889
<i>They're socialists.</i>

1150
00:55:28,922 --> 00:55:30,290
<i>They kept their cars,</i>

1151
00:55:30,323 --> 00:55:32,259
<i>they kept their way of life.</i>

1152
00:55:32,292 --> 00:55:34,727
<i>Um, they don't seem
to have any problem</i>

1153
00:55:34,761 --> 00:55:36,063
<i>with food shortage there.</i>

1154
00:55:38,732 --> 00:55:41,301
<i>Hugo Chávez died
a billionaire.</i>

1155
00:55:41,334 --> 00:55:44,871
<i>Under Chávez,
and now his successor Maduro,</i>

1156
00:55:44,905 --> 00:55:48,607
<i>Venezuelan socialism
started out as democratic</i>

1157
00:55:48,641 --> 00:55:51,044
<i>but quickly became
authoritarian.</i>

1158
00:55:51,078 --> 00:55:54,314
<i>Venezuela is where
the Democrats are taking us,</i>

1159
00:55:54,347 --> 00:55:56,349
<i>whether they admit it or not.</i>

1160
00:55:56,383 --> 00:56:00,987
Today, I ask every member
of the Maduro regime:

1161
00:56:01,021 --> 00:56:03,722
end this nightmare of poverty,

1162
00:56:03,757 --> 00:56:07,060
hunger and death
for your people.

1163
00:56:07,094 --> 00:56:09,830
Let your people go.

1164
00:56:09,863 --> 00:56:11,965
Set your country free.

1165
00:56:11,998 --> 00:56:13,632
<i>We've seen gun control</i>

1166
00:56:13,666 --> 00:56:16,136
<i>as a socialist tactic
in Venezuela.</i>

1167
00:56:16,169 --> 00:56:19,672
<i>So, how does the politics
of gun control play out</i>

1168
00:56:19,705 --> 00:56:21,707
<i>in America?</i>

1169
00:56:21,741 --> 00:56:24,744
<i>Biden used to be a strong
supporter of gun rights.</i>

1170
00:56:24,778 --> 00:56:28,014
Buy a shotgun. Buy a shotgun.

1171
00:56:28,048 --> 00:56:29,883
<i>Not anymore.</i>

1172
00:56:29,916 --> 00:56:32,185
If I'm elected, NRA,
I'm coming for you.

1173
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:34,421
And, gun manufacturers,
I'm gonna take you on,

1174
00:56:34,454 --> 00:56:35,789
and I'm gonna beat you.

1175
00:56:35,822 --> 00:56:37,157
I'm the only one who's gonna.

1176
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:38,657
<i>And who does Biden want</i>

1177
00:56:38,691 --> 00:56:40,427
<i>to work with on gun control?</i>

1178
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:43,897
Hell yes, we're gonna take
your AR-15, your AK-47.

1179
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:46,066
<i>They claim
that guns are to blame</i>

1180
00:56:46,099 --> 00:56:48,135
<i>for tragic events like this.</i>

1181
00:56:50,203 --> 00:56:52,973
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

1182
00:56:53,006 --> 00:56:55,075
<i>I think I hear gunshots.</i>

1183
00:56:55,108 --> 00:56:57,978
<i>Are you at the school?</i>

1184
00:57:01,714 --> 00:57:03,917
<i>High school, shots fired.</i>

1185
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:05,952
<i>1200 building.</i>

1186
00:57:05,986 --> 00:57:07,821
<i>They're saying it's a male
in a hoodie.</i>

1187
00:57:07,854 --> 00:57:09,789
<i>He could not describe what...</i>

1188
00:57:09,823 --> 00:57:13,026
<i>At least an AR-15,
if not an AK-47.</i>

1189
00:57:14,227 --> 00:57:15,829
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

1190
00:57:15,862 --> 00:57:17,464
<i>It's gonna be fine.
Can you hide somewhere?</i>

1191
00:57:17,497 --> 00:57:20,300
<i>Can you play dead?</i>

1192
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:23,003
<i>My daughter has no voice.</i>

1193
00:57:23,036 --> 00:57:27,474
She was murdered last week,
and she was taken from us.

1194
00:57:27,507 --> 00:57:31,710
Shot nine times
on the third floor.

1195
00:57:33,513 --> 00:57:37,683
No, w-we, as a country,
failed our children.

1196
00:57:38,985 --> 00:57:41,188
<i>Andrew Pollack,
a grieving father,</i>

1197
00:57:41,221 --> 00:57:45,492
<i>has investigated the roots
of the Parkland shooting.</i>

1198
00:57:45,525 --> 00:57:47,961
<i>There's not
a moment that goes by</i>

1199
00:57:47,994 --> 00:57:49,729
<i>that I don't think of her.</i>

1200
00:57:49,763 --> 00:57:53,066
And your book is titled
<i>Why Meadow Died.</i>

1201
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:55,335
- Why did Meadow die?
- They wanted to avoid

1202
00:57:55,368 --> 00:57:57,804
and end
the school-to-prison pipeline

1203
00:57:57,837 --> 00:58:00,307
and end suspensions
and expulsions.

1204
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:03,376
So, they just wanted to stop
holding kids accountable.

1205
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:05,412
In Broward,
children were allowed

1206
00:58:05,445 --> 00:58:08,048
four misdemeanors
per school year

1207
00:58:08,081 --> 00:58:11,284
without ever getting introduced
to the judicial system.

1208
00:58:11,318 --> 00:58:14,421
Now, did... the shooter
himself, he had a history.

1209
00:58:14,454 --> 00:58:16,957
<i>My name is Nik,
and I'm gonna be</i>

1210
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:19,526
the next school shooter of 2018.

1211
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:23,196
You're all going to die.

1212
00:58:26,166 --> 00:58:30,136
45 calls to this individual's
house without an arrest.

1213
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:31,471
And this is after
we're already familiar

1214
00:58:31,504 --> 00:58:34,107
with Columbine, Sandy Hook.

1215
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:36,376
One of the things you say
that I find very striking

1216
00:58:36,409 --> 00:58:40,513
is the fact that the policies
of the school had the effect

1217
00:58:40,547 --> 00:58:45,118
of taking kids who were
very disturbed and violent

1218
00:58:45,151 --> 00:58:48,455
and classifying them,
in a sense, as handicapped.

1219
00:58:48,488 --> 00:58:51,191
You could have a kid
that's emotionally disturbed,

1220
00:58:51,224 --> 00:58:54,160
or they call it "oppositional
defiant disorder"...

1221
00:58:54,194 --> 00:58:56,229
it's O.D.D.,
which is another word

1222
00:58:56,263 --> 00:58:58,798
for, like, a psychopath
that's a juvenile...

1223
00:58:58,832 --> 00:59:02,035
and they label them
special needs.

1224
00:59:02,068 --> 00:59:03,870
And that's what makes them
untouchable

1225
00:59:03,903 --> 00:59:05,238
within the school district.

1226
00:59:05,272 --> 00:59:07,874
The man whose job it was
to keep students safe

1227
00:59:07,907 --> 00:59:10,043
was arrested today.

1228
00:59:10,076 --> 00:59:12,379
<i>Surveillance tape shows
the school resource officer</i>

1229
00:59:12,412 --> 00:59:14,848
<i>never entered the building
as bullets flew.</i>

1230
00:59:14,881 --> 00:59:16,549
<i>In some of the video that I saw</i>

1231
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:19,085
from the body cam,
you can see a deputy

1232
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:22,289
getting out of his car,
and you could hear the gunshots

1233
00:59:22,322 --> 00:59:23,823
that could be killing
my daughter,

1234
00:59:23,857 --> 00:59:25,292
and he's taking his time

1235
00:59:25,325 --> 00:59:27,994
going to the back of his car
to put his vest on.

1236
00:59:28,028 --> 00:59:29,562
And he never goes, even,
in the building.

1237
00:59:29,596 --> 00:59:32,265
Do you think that,
if-if there was a coach

1238
00:59:32,299 --> 00:59:35,268
or a teacher or teachers
who were trained and armed,

1239
00:59:35,302 --> 00:59:37,837
that your daughter
might be alive today?

1240
00:59:37,871 --> 00:59:42,175
I know, a-as a fact, that
my daughter would be alive.

1241
00:59:42,208 --> 00:59:45,612
What have you found the role
of the media to be

1242
00:59:45,645 --> 00:59:47,247
in covering these shootings?

1243
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,383
They don't want to hear
the truth, the media.

1244
00:59:50,417 --> 00:59:52,852
And I almost feel
like they gloat

1245
00:59:52,886 --> 00:59:54,554
when there's a mass shooting.

1246
00:59:54,587 --> 00:59:57,324
And that, before the victims
are even buried

1247
00:59:57,357 --> 00:59:59,893
and the facts are out,
they're blaming, uh,

1248
00:59:59,926 --> 01:00:02,996
the-the president or they're
blaming, uh, the scary rifle.

1249
01:00:03,029 --> 01:00:04,464
They want to attack
the Second Amendment.

1250
01:00:04,497 --> 01:00:06,399
That's their agenda.

1251
01:00:06,433 --> 01:00:08,968
The Second Amendment means
a lot to me now because,

1252
01:00:09,002 --> 01:00:11,304
like I said, my daughter
was on the third floor,

1253
01:00:11,338 --> 01:00:13,173
and no one came to save her.

1254
01:00:13,206 --> 01:00:15,442
A lot of times you call 911,

1255
01:00:15,475 --> 01:00:17,310
it doesn't mean
they're coming to help you.

1256
01:00:17,344 --> 01:00:20,080
So, why should I give up
that right to defend myself?

1257
01:00:32,292 --> 01:00:34,928
<i>Now we turn
to the socialist left's</i>

1258
01:00:34,961 --> 01:00:38,131
<i>biggest allies...
Hollywood and the media.</i>

1259
01:00:38,164 --> 01:00:42,936
<i>The left owns these megaphones
which dominate our culture.</i>

01:00:51,978 --> 01:00:53,947
<i>You're an African American,
you're a patriot,</i>

1265
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:56,616
you're an anti-communist,
you're a veteran.

1266
01:00:56,649 --> 01:00:58,184
You're a lonely guy
in Hollywood.

1267
01:00:59,986 --> 01:01:01,521
Yeah, I have no friends.

1268
01:01:01,554 --> 01:01:03,256
- I have no friends.
- You have no friends.

1269
01:01:03,289 --> 01:01:05,925
And here you came to Hollywood,
you... as an outsider.

1270
01:01:05,959 --> 01:01:07,927
I always knew
that it was very...

1271
01:01:07,961 --> 01:01:10,330
it would be very difficult
for a personality like me

1272
01:01:10,363 --> 01:01:11,598
to actually be in Los Angeles,

1273
01:01:11,631 --> 01:01:13,133
'cause I've always
considered myself

1274
01:01:13,166 --> 01:01:14,701
a Frederick Douglass Republican
without a home.

1275
01:01:14,735 --> 01:01:16,403
But actually,
it's just destiny for me

1276
01:01:16,436 --> 01:01:19,072
because now I feel like
I am at home.

1277
01:01:19,105 --> 01:01:22,041
Are you saying
that you feel more at home

1278
01:01:22,075 --> 01:01:26,980
in the GOP as Trump defines it?

1279
01:01:27,013 --> 01:01:28,581
I feel more comfortable
because Trump...

1280
01:01:28,615 --> 01:01:31,484
Yeah, I have to give the credit
to President Donald Trump.

1281
01:01:31,518 --> 01:01:33,553
Well, what is it about Trump
that-that drew you?

1282
01:01:33,586 --> 01:01:35,255
I-I lived in New York in 1980.

1283
01:01:35,288 --> 01:01:37,690
I knew who he was.
He was a hero to me.

1284
01:01:37,724 --> 01:01:38,992
<i>He was a billionaire.</i>

1285
01:01:39,025 --> 01:01:40,193
<i>Before he became president,</i>

1286
01:01:40,226 --> 01:01:42,162
<i>he was someone
you looked up to.</i>

1287
01:01:42,195 --> 01:01:45,231
<i>Every rapper was singing about
trying to be Donald Trump.</i>

1288
01:01:45,265 --> 01:01:47,000
I read <i>The Deal</i> twice.

1289
01:01:47,033 --> 01:01:48,601
<i>The Art of the Deal.</i>
I know it.

1290
01:01:48,635 --> 01:01:51,704
I'm assuming Hollywood
has always had left-wing tilt.

1291
01:01:51,739 --> 01:01:53,440
It seems like
what's different now

1292
01:01:53,473 --> 01:01:55,275
is not that Hollywood is left

1293
01:01:55,308 --> 01:01:59,979
but that Hollywood has become
so insular and monopolistic

1294
01:02:00,013 --> 01:02:01,981
about being left wing

1295
01:02:02,015 --> 01:02:04,484
that it actually terrorizes
people or attempts to.

1296
01:02:04,517 --> 01:02:06,653
You have to understand
that the majority

1297
01:02:06,686 --> 01:02:09,222
of the people
that are running Hollywood

1298
01:02:09,255 --> 01:02:12,192
were abused in most
Southern states for being...

1299
01:02:12,225 --> 01:02:14,627
because of maybe
their sexual orientation

1300
01:02:14,661 --> 01:02:16,629
or being creative
or being different.

1301
01:02:16,663 --> 01:02:19,399
So they've been treated poorly,
and they've been pushed,

1302
01:02:19,432 --> 01:02:21,501
and they find themselves going
to Hollywood to be

1303
01:02:21,534 --> 01:02:24,137
more liberal, be more free.
Everything is okay.

1304
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:26,774
No behavior...
There's no boundaries.

1305
01:02:26,807 --> 01:02:28,475
The revenge of the hurt.

1306
01:02:28,508 --> 01:02:30,677
- Right.
- Yeah, revenge of the hurt.

1307
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:32,412
- Yeah. There you go.
- Well, it also explains

1308
01:02:32,445 --> 01:02:34,514
the sort of amoralism
of Hollywood, because when...

1309
01:02:34,547 --> 01:02:36,416
when you feel repressed, then...

1310
01:02:36,449 --> 01:02:39,552
then "anything goes"
becomes a sign of freedom.

1311
01:02:39,586 --> 01:02:41,254
Good point.

1312
01:02:43,223 --> 01:02:45,658
<i>Even more influential

1313
01:02:45,692 --> 01:02:47,460

1316

01:02:55,435 --> 01:02:57,070
and their media partners

1318
01:02:57,103 --> 01:02:58,671
standing right back there.

1319
01:03:00,073 --> 01:03:02,041
<i>What is fake news?</i>

1320
01:03:02,075 --> 01:03:03,643
<i>It's not just about bias.</i>

1321
01:03:03,676 --> 01:03:06,379
<i>It goes much deeper than that.</i>

1322
01:03:10,751 --> 01:03:14,187
<i>In the early 1970s,
Saul Alinsky discovered</i>

<i>Some activists

1326

1327
01:03:32,138 --> 01:03:35,575
<i>Alinksy had a radical idea.</i>

1328

<i>Meet Larry Sinclair.</i>

1342
01:04:46,479 --> 01:04:48,882
What do you do for a living,
Mr. Sinclair?

1343
01:04:48,916 --> 01:04:51,184
Currently,
I run a nonprofit in Cocoa,

1344
01:04:51,217 --> 01:04:52,518
building affordable housing.

1345
01:04:52,552 --> 01:04:54,587
Now, in 2008, when Obama

1346
01:04:54,621 --> 01:04:56,757
announced his candidacy
for president,

1347
01:04:56,790 --> 01:05:00,326
you made some explosive
allegations about him

1348
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:04,330
that dated back to some events
that occurred in 1999.

1349
01:05:04,364 --> 01:05:06,466
Is that the year
that you met Barack Obama?

1350
01:05:06,499 --> 01:05:07,901
It is.

1351
01:05:07,935 --> 01:05:11,571
- Where did you meet him?
- Outside of a bar in Chicago.

1352
01:05:11,604 --> 01:05:14,374
- What were you doing?
- I was on a night out.

1353
01:05:14,407 --> 01:05:17,176
I had asked a limo driver
if he knew anyone

1354
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:19,813
that would be interested
in showing me around the town,

1355
01:05:19,847 --> 01:05:22,850
and it was clear
for the limo driver

1356
01:05:22,883 --> 01:05:25,551
that I was looking for someone
to enjoy the night with.

1357
01:05:25,585 --> 01:05:27,955
The introduction was made
through the limo driver.

1358
01:05:27,988 --> 01:05:29,455
And what happened?

1359
01:05:29,489 --> 01:05:31,457
Uh, we had a few drinks.

1360
01:05:31,491 --> 01:05:34,694
Uh, I had made some comments
about wanting coke,

1361
01:05:34,727 --> 01:05:37,530
so we got in the limo
and left, and...

1362
01:05:37,563 --> 01:05:40,768
we started drinking,
I started snorting,

1363
01:05:40,801 --> 01:05:42,836
he started smoking.

1364
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:45,338
I actually put my hand
on his knee

1365
01:05:45,371 --> 01:05:47,440
and started
to rub up his thigh,

1366
01:05:47,473 --> 01:05:50,710
and I performed oral sex
on Barack Obama.

1367
01:05:50,744 --> 01:05:53,881
The following day,
I actually get a knock

1368
01:05:53,914 --> 01:05:56,917
on my hotel room door
in Gurnee, Illinois,

1369
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:59,585
only to find Barack Obama
standing in front of it.

1370
01:05:59,619 --> 01:06:01,487
He had actually come back
for seconds.

1371
01:06:01,521 --> 01:06:04,858
I performed oral sex on him
in the hotel room

1372
01:06:04,892 --> 01:06:07,928
at the Comfort Inn and Suites
in Gurnee, Illinois.

1373
01:06:07,961 --> 01:06:10,229
Were there drugs involved
on the second night, as well?

1374
01:06:10,263 --> 01:06:12,498
- There was.
- Who produced those?

1375
01:06:12,532 --> 01:06:14,267
He actually brought those
with him.

1376
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,302
Now, Obama at that time was
a state senator?

1377
01:06:16,335 --> 01:06:18,705
I actually had no idea
who he was.

1378
01:06:18,739 --> 01:06:21,441
And then when did you find out
that it was Barack Obama?

1379
01:06:21,474 --> 01:06:24,778
Watching the 2004
DNC Convention.

1380
01:06:24,812 --> 01:06:26,612
Thank you very much, everybody.
God bless you.

1381
01:06:26,646 --> 01:06:27,881
Thank you.

1382
01:06:27,915 --> 01:06:29,582
<i>And it hit me.</i>

1383
01:06:29,615 --> 01:06:32,820
And, um, at the time,
I was just kind of floored.

1384
01:06:32,853 --> 01:06:34,454
Good afternoon.

1385
01:06:34,487 --> 01:06:37,024
Uh, my name is
Montgomery Blair Sibley.

1386
01:06:37,057 --> 01:06:38,959
I'm the attorney
for Larry Sinclair.

1387
01:06:38,992 --> 01:06:40,794
Now, you have
this press conference.

1388
01:06:40,828 --> 01:06:43,797
I performed fellatio on
Senator Obama in the limousine

1389
01:06:43,831 --> 01:06:46,632
during the time Senator Obama
was smoking crack cocaine.

1390
01:06:46,666 --> 01:06:50,303
After the press conference,
you are arrested.

01:06:53,673 --> 01:06:55,809
attorney general for Delaware.

1393
01:06:55,843 --> 01:06:59,412
- So, this is Joe Biden's son, Beau Biden?
- It is.

1394
01:06:59,445 --> 01:07:02,515
Apparently, he had
a grand jury indictment

1395
01:07:02,548 --> 01:07:04,752
from two weeks
after I went public on Obama,

1396
01:07:04,785 --> 01:07:07,054
accusing me of theft
that never took place.

1397
01:07:07,087 --> 01:07:09,757
Shortly before you made
these public allegations

1398
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:12,358
about Obama,
you were contacted, you say,

1399
01:07:12,391 --> 01:07:14,494
by a man named Donald Young.

1400
01:07:14,527 --> 01:07:16,029
Donald Young was
the choir director

1401
01:07:16,063 --> 01:07:17,831
in Jeremiah Wright's church
in Chicago.

1402
01:07:17,865 --> 01:07:19,767
This is the church
Obama attended?

1403
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,434
Exactly.

1404
01:07:21,467 --> 01:07:23,436
And what did Donald Young
tell you?

1405
01:07:23,469 --> 01:07:24,838
That he, too,
had intimate relations

1406
01:07:24,872 --> 01:07:27,640
with Barack Obama
and had for... for years,

1407
01:07:27,673 --> 01:07:30,944
and that I needed
to protect myself.

1408
01:07:30,978 --> 01:07:32,780
That they were going
to come after me.

1409
01:07:32,813 --> 01:07:34,680
What happened to him?

1410
01:07:34,714 --> 01:07:38,752
He was shot point-blank
in his apartment in Chicago.

1411
01:07:38,786 --> 01:07:40,353
The murder was never solved?

1412
01:07:40,386 --> 01:07:41,687
No, it wasn't.

1413
01:07:41,721 --> 01:07:45,025
Donald Young's mother
subsequently made

1414
01:07:45,058 --> 01:07:46,559
a public comment,
I believe reported

1415
01:07:46,592 --> 01:07:48,929
in one of the tabloids.
What did she say?

1416
01:07:48,962 --> 01:07:51,932
She wanted to know
why her son had to die

1417
01:07:51,965 --> 01:07:54,567
to protect his friend,
the president,

1418
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,870
which was referring
to Barack Obama.

1419
01:07:56,904 --> 01:07:58,906
Did you have this kind
of a conversation

1420
01:07:58,939 --> 01:08:01,440
where you describe
what happened to you

1421
01:08:01,474 --> 01:08:03,709
on any of the major networks?

1422
01:08:03,744 --> 01:08:05,112
No.

1423
01:08:05,145 --> 01:08:06,679
Did <i>The New York Times</i>

1424
01:08:06,712 --> 01:08:08,614
or <i>The Washington Post</i>
interview you?

1425
01:08:08,648 --> 01:08:12,085
- No.
- Have you heard of Stormy Daniels?

1426
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:14,387
Who hasn't
heard of Stormy Daniels?

1427
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:16,622
On the alleged affair
between Donald Trump

1428
01:08:16,656 --> 01:08:19,026
and adult film star
Stormy Daniels.

1429
01:08:19,059 --> 01:08:21,128
Please welcome Stormy Daniels.

1430
01:08:23,964 --> 01:08:25,698
Please welcome Stormy Daniels.

1431
01:08:28,135 --> 01:08:29,602
Here we go.

1432
01:08:29,635 --> 01:08:31,071
<i>22 million viewers</i>

1433
01:08:31,104 --> 01:08:35,108
<i>tuned in to</i> 60 Minutes <i>Sunday</i>
<i>to hear Stormy Daniels' story.</i>

1434
01:08:35,142 --> 01:08:37,476
I hereby,
along with my colleague,

1435
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:39,746
Mayor Pro Tem John D'Amico,
declare it

1436
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:43,382
Stormy Daniels Day
in the city of West Hollywood.

1437
01:08:44,818 --> 01:08:46,854
<i>What happened
to Larry Sinclair Day?</i>

1438
01:08:48,554 --> 01:08:50,824
<i>Whether or not
you believe their stories,</i>

1439
01:08:50,858 --> 01:08:53,927
<i>these two did not get
equal treatment from the media.</i>

1440
01:08:56,129 --> 01:08:58,098
<i>The power of the media
is not just</i>

1441
01:08:58,131 --> 01:08:59,800
<i>the power to twist the news.</i>

1442
01:08:59,833 --> 01:09:04,470
<i>It's to make the news
and even to fabricate the news.</i>

1443
01:09:05,772 --> 01:09:07,440
<i>What's the solution?</i>

1444
01:09:07,473 --> 01:09:10,443
<i>We have to create
alternative forms of media,</i>

1445
01:09:10,476 --> 01:09:13,713
<i>and we have to reduce
the power of the media</i>

1446
01:09:13,747 --> 01:09:15,949
<i>in our minds.</i>

1447
01:09:20,754 --> 01:09:25,558
<i>Another ally of the socialist
left is the deep state,</i>

1448
01:09:25,591 --> 01:09:28,461
<i>the police agencies
of government...</i>

1449
01:09:28,494 --> 01:09:33,432
<i>the IRS, the FBI,
the CIA, the DOJ.</i>

1450
01:09:33,466 --> 01:09:37,037
<i>One of its early targets
was Catherine Engelbrecht,</i>

1451
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:39,672
<i>whose organization
True the Vote</i>

1452
01:09:39,705 --> 01:09:42,142
<i>investigates allegations
of voter fraud.</i>

1453
01:09:42,175 --> 01:09:45,444
So you file your application
for nonprofit status

1454
01:09:45,478 --> 01:09:47,580
for True the Vote
with the government.

1455
01:09:47,613 --> 01:09:48,949
And then what happens?

1456
01:09:48,982 --> 01:09:51,018
Well, then suddenly,
we began being visited

1457
01:09:51,051 --> 01:09:53,552
by an alphabet soup
of federal agencies,

1458
01:09:53,586 --> 01:09:55,088
starting with the FBI,

1459
01:09:55,122 --> 01:09:57,456
uh, requesting to see
member manifests,

1460
01:09:57,490 --> 01:09:59,092
meaning that they wanted
to find out

1461
01:09:59,126 --> 01:10:01,862
who was attending our meetings
and what we were talking about.

1462
01:10:01,895 --> 01:10:03,964
Uh, that then moved to the IRS,

1463
01:10:03,997 --> 01:10:07,000
who came in and began auditing
our-our personal taxes

1464
01:10:07,034 --> 01:10:08,735
and our business taxes.

1465
01:10:10,237 --> 01:10:11,872
<i>In a period of 18 months,</i>

1466
01:10:11,905 --> 01:10:13,706
<i>I went through
23 different audits</i>

1467
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:15,909
<i>or investigations
or inquiries. 23.</i>

1468
01:10:15,943 --> 01:10:17,844
<i>What were some of the things</i>

1469
01:10:17,878 --> 01:10:19,980
<i>that the IRS wanted
to find out about you?</i>

1470
01:10:20,013 --> 01:10:21,915
<i>They wanted to know</i>

1471
01:10:21,949 --> 01:10:23,516
every Facebook posting
I've ever posted

1472
01:10:23,549 --> 01:10:24,918
and every tweet I'd ever tweeted

1473
01:10:24,952 --> 01:10:26,686
and everywhere I'd ever spoken

1474
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:28,021
since the inception
of the organization

1475
01:10:28,055 --> 01:10:29,622
and to whom and what I said

1476
01:10:29,655 --> 01:10:31,224
and if I was gonna run
for political office

1477
01:10:31,258 --> 01:10:33,659
and who was on my board and...

1478
01:10:33,693 --> 01:10:36,263
They wanted to know things

1479
01:10:36,296 --> 01:10:38,664
that amounted
to opposition research.

1480
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:42,269
<i>Why would they target you?</i>

1481
01:10:42,302 --> 01:10:45,272
I think they saw that
True the Vote was going to,

1482
01:10:45,305 --> 01:10:48,641
for the first time,
ask the tough questions

1483
01:10:48,674 --> 01:10:51,577
and ask citizens
to take a look for themselves,

1484
01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:54,281
uh, into an area
that has long been, uh,

1485
01:10:54,314 --> 01:10:55,916
the bastion of the radical left.

1486
01:10:55,949 --> 01:10:58,018
Did you realize even then

1487
01:10:58,051 --> 01:11:00,821
that this mobilization
of powerful institutions

1488
01:11:00,854 --> 01:11:04,590
represented the weaponization
of the U.S. government

1489
01:11:04,623 --> 01:11:06,559
against you
and what you were doing?

1490
01:11:06,592 --> 01:11:08,195
I didn't want to believe it,

1491
01:11:08,228 --> 01:11:09,930
but it was undeniable.

1492
01:11:09,963 --> 01:11:11,798
Do you believe
in the deep state?

1493
01:11:11,832 --> 01:11:13,266
I lived it.

1494
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:16,269
<i>The deep state's
ultimate target is Trump.</i>

1495
01:11:16,303 --> 01:11:18,604
<i>They've been talking
about impeaching him</i>

1496
01:11:18,637 --> 01:11:20,606
<i>ever since he ran for office.</i>

1497
01:11:20,639 --> 01:11:22,943
I'm concerned that if we don't
impeach this president,

1498
01:11:22,976 --> 01:11:24,878
he will get reelected.

1499
01:11:24,911 --> 01:11:26,813
Because we're gonna
go in there, and we're gonna

1500
01:11:26,847 --> 01:11:28,815
impeach the mother.

1501
01:11:28,849 --> 01:11:30,716
He is a dictator.

1502
01:11:30,751 --> 01:11:32,319
This must not stand.

1503
01:11:32,352 --> 01:11:33,954
He's impeached forever.

1504
01:11:35,188 --> 01:11:37,124
<i>The organized attack on Trump</i>

1505
01:11:37,157 --> 01:11:40,693
<i>began with a young staffer
on the Trump campaign...</i>

1506
01:11:40,726 --> 01:11:42,195
<i>George Papadopoulos.</i>

1507
01:11:42,229 --> 01:11:44,731
<i>I met with him
and his wife Simona.</i>

1508
01:11:44,765 --> 01:11:47,600
I want to talk to you
about a series of characters

1509
01:11:47,633 --> 01:11:50,669
who came into your life
in those crucial months

1510
01:11:50,703 --> 01:11:54,007
in the spring and summer
of 2016.

1511
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:56,743
<i>First, you ran into a fellow
named Joseph Mifsud.</i>

1512
01:11:58,045 --> 01:12:00,646
<i>Uh, who is Joseph Mifsud?</i>

1513
01:12:00,679 --> 01:12:03,183
<i>Joseph Mifsud is the infamous</i>

1514
01:12:03,216 --> 01:12:05,584
<i>overseas professor
characterized</i>

1515
01:12:05,618 --> 01:12:08,321
by Bob Mueller and the FBI
as a Russian agent.

1516
01:12:08,355 --> 01:12:09,923
There could be nothing further
from the truth.

1517
01:12:09,956 --> 01:12:13,193
Ironically, Simona,
you knew Joseph Mifsud.

1518
01:12:13,226 --> 01:12:15,628
Joseph Mifsud is somebody
who has many ties

1519
01:12:15,661 --> 01:12:17,197
to, uh, intelligence,

1520
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:19,833
uh, particularly
Western intelligence.

1521
01:12:19,866 --> 01:12:21,902
So, what you're saying is
that Joseph Mifsud,

1522
01:12:21,935 --> 01:12:23,370
far from being a Russian agent,

1523
01:12:23,403 --> 01:12:25,739
is actually part
of what you would call

1524
01:12:25,772 --> 01:12:28,607
- the-the Western deep state.
- Western intelligence.

1525
01:12:28,641 --> 01:12:31,244
So, here comes this guy Mifsud,
and he meets you.

1526
01:12:31,278 --> 01:12:33,313
Over brunch one day,
he leans over

1527
01:12:33,346 --> 01:12:34,713
in a conspiratorial manner.

1528
01:12:34,748 --> 01:12:36,283
He tells me, "George,

1529
01:12:36,316 --> 01:12:39,086
"I've just come back
from Russia, and I've learned

1530
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:41,720
that the Russians have
Hillary Clinton's e-mails."

1531
01:12:41,755 --> 01:12:45,358
It's quite clear
that he was an operative

1532
01:12:45,392 --> 01:12:49,162
who was supposed to deliver
this information to me

1533
01:12:49,196 --> 01:12:51,398
with the hope
that I would then transmit it

1534
01:12:51,431 --> 01:12:53,867
to the campaign,
which would eventually

1535
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,969
create a conspiracy case.

1536
01:12:56,002 --> 01:12:58,805
I never told anybody
on the campaign about e-mails.

1537
01:12:58,839 --> 01:13:00,907
So, Mifsud exits the scene.

1538
01:13:00,941 --> 01:13:03,676
<i>And so, another character
is now dispatched</i>

1539
01:13:03,709 --> 01:13:06,413
<i>to meet you... Stefan Halper.</i>

1540
01:13:06,446 --> 01:13:07,948
<i>I didn't understand</i>

1541
01:13:07,981 --> 01:13:09,916
<i>that he was tied directly
and indirectly</i>

1542
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:11,418
to the CIA and to the MI6.

1543
01:13:11,451 --> 01:13:13,019
What was he saying to you?

1544
01:13:13,053 --> 01:13:14,387
He was accusing me

1545
01:13:14,421 --> 01:13:16,655
and Donald Trump
and the campaign

1546
01:13:16,689 --> 01:13:19,392
of working with Russia
and WikiLeaks

1547
01:13:19,426 --> 01:13:22,295
and, uh, to coordinate
this e-mail release.

1548
01:13:22,329 --> 01:13:23,430
And what I told him...

1549
01:13:23,463 --> 01:13:25,198
"What you're talking about
is treason."

1550
01:13:25,232 --> 01:13:29,870
<i>You now encounter
a guy named Charles Tawil.</i>

1551
01:13:29,903 --> 01:13:32,205
<i>He characterized himself as</i>

1552
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:35,674
an Israeli businessman
who knew about my work

1553
01:13:35,708 --> 01:13:37,844
and wanted to hire me
as a consultant.

1554
01:13:37,878 --> 01:13:39,946
Immediately upon, uh,
landing in Israel,

1555
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:42,715
I'm, uh, brought to a hotel

1556
01:13:42,749 --> 01:13:45,819
where I'm in a room
with Charles Tawil,

1557
01:13:45,852 --> 01:13:49,422
and there's $10,000
in his hand in cash.

1558
01:13:49,456 --> 01:13:51,158
So, the money was ostensibly
for this research

1559
01:13:51,191 --> 01:13:52,691
that you were supposed to do.

1560
01:13:52,725 --> 01:13:53,927
- Correct?
- That's right.

1561
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:57,430
You arrive later
in Dulles Airport.

1562
01:13:57,464 --> 01:14:00,233
As soon as I land
at Dulles Airport,

1563
01:14:00,267 --> 01:14:02,135
I see a badge flipped out.

1564
01:14:02,169 --> 01:14:03,870
"This is the FBI.
Come with us."

1565
01:14:03,904 --> 01:14:06,773
Two agents walk me
into this, uh, side room.

1566
01:14:06,806 --> 01:14:10,177
FBI agent one
rummaging through my luggage.

1567
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:12,711
Looking, presumably,
for the $10,000, right?

1568
01:14:12,746 --> 01:14:14,748
- That's absolutely right.
- And do they find it?

1569
01:14:14,781 --> 01:14:16,349
- No, and...
- Why not?

1570
01:14:16,383 --> 01:14:18,418
They didn't find the money
because I left it

1571
01:14:18,451 --> 01:14:19,986
with a lawyer in Greece.

1572
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:21,354
I ask FBI agent two,

1573
01:14:21,388 --> 01:14:23,390
"What's going on?
What did I do here?"

1574
01:14:23,423 --> 01:14:25,458
"This is what happens when
you work for Donald Trump."

1575
01:14:25,492 --> 01:14:27,460
The next moment,
I'm looking down.

1576
01:14:27,494 --> 01:14:29,896
My hands are being put
in handcuffs,

1577
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:31,464
my ankles are shacked,

1578
01:14:31,498 --> 01:14:34,301
where I'm then taken
to a dirty cell in Alexandria.

1579
01:14:34,334 --> 01:14:37,771
So, you were drawn, Simona,
directly into this plot

1580
01:14:37,804 --> 01:14:40,006
in an encounter with the FBI.

1581
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,374
Did they want you
to wear a wire on George?

1582
01:14:41,408 --> 01:14:43,476
Yes, they wanted me
to cooperate with them

1583
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:45,412
and basically spy on him.

1584
01:14:45,445 --> 01:14:48,215
So, George, here you are
under arrest.

1585
01:14:48,248 --> 01:14:50,517
- Charged with what?
- Lying to the FBI

1586
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:52,152
and obstruction of justice.

1587
01:14:52,185 --> 01:14:55,021
- What was the penalty?
- 35 years in prison.

1588
01:14:55,055 --> 01:14:57,023
So, this is a story

1589
01:14:57,057 --> 01:15:00,160
of how your own country's
intelligence agencies,

1590
01:15:00,193 --> 01:15:03,296
in cohorts with the
intelligence agencies of other

1591
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:07,167
Western countries,
conspired together

1592
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,102
to entrap you

1593
01:15:09,135 --> 01:15:12,505
into making admissions

1594
01:15:12,539 --> 01:15:16,276
that were, in fact, not true,
with a view of using you

1595
01:15:16,309 --> 01:15:18,845
against Trump... true or false?

1596
01:15:18,878 --> 01:15:20,247
Absolutely true.

1597
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,849
And the evidence
backs it all up now.

1598
01:15:25,852 --> 01:15:27,887
<i>Corruption in government goes</i>

1599
01:15:27,921 --> 01:15:29,356
<i>all the way to the top,</i>

1600
01:15:29,389 --> 01:15:33,460
<i>according to author
and researcher Peter Schweizer.</i>

1601
01:15:33,493 --> 01:15:36,796
Peter, when I listen
to leading figures

1602
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:40,967
on the political left railing
against, uh, multimillionaires

1603
01:15:41,001 --> 01:15:43,003
and billionaires, I...

1604
01:15:43,036 --> 01:15:45,305
you kind of get the impression
that they don't care

1605
01:15:45,338 --> 01:15:49,175
about money, but they do care
about money, don't they?

1606
01:15:49,209 --> 01:15:51,911
Absolutely, and they show it in
all sorts of ways, especially

1607
01:15:51,945 --> 01:15:53,847
when it comes
to their own finances.

1608
01:15:55,048 --> 01:15:57,050
<i>The Bidens have done very well,</i>

1609
01:15:57,083 --> 01:15:59,452
and Joe Biden's been
very, uh, sophisticated

1610
01:15:59,486 --> 01:16:01,588
and shrewd
in the way he's done it.

1611
01:16:01,621 --> 01:16:04,958
He's essentially offshored
the corruption, which means

1612
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:07,027
he's been in politics,
was in politics

1613
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:09,529
for more than 40 years,
uh, and during that time,

1614
01:16:09,562 --> 01:16:11,898
his net worth
really didn't grow,

1615
01:16:11,931 --> 01:16:16,403
but what did grow was the net
worth of his family members.

1616
01:16:16,436 --> 01:16:19,339
Politician like Joe Biden...
he has to disclose

1617
01:16:19,372 --> 01:16:22,375
if he has $1,000
in General Electric stock.

1618
01:16:22,409 --> 01:16:26,212
He has to disclose if he gets
a $200 campaign contribution.

1619
01:16:26,246 --> 01:16:29,482
But if his brother gets
a massive government contract,

1620
01:16:29,516 --> 01:16:32,552
if his son does a massive
private equity deal

1621
01:16:32,585 --> 01:16:34,220
with a foreign government,

1622
01:16:34,254 --> 01:16:35,889
there's no disclosure
requirement.

1623
01:16:35,922 --> 01:16:39,559
Let's track a little bit
of the Biden family racket.

1624
01:16:39,592 --> 01:16:42,195
Biden's brother... James Biden.

1625
01:16:42,228 --> 01:16:44,898
Go back to November of 2010.

1626
01:16:44,931 --> 01:16:47,000
<i>A guy named Kevin Justice
shows up</i>

1627
01:16:47,033 --> 01:16:49,436
<i>at the vice president's office
in the White House.</i>

1628
01:16:49,469 --> 01:16:51,404
<i>Three weeks later,</i>

1629
01:16:51,438 --> 01:16:53,206
Kevin Justice appoints
James Biden,

1630
01:16:53,239 --> 01:16:55,275
who has no experience,

1631
01:16:55,308 --> 01:16:58,044
as the new executive
vice president of HillStone,

1632
01:16:58,078 --> 01:17:01,114
a construction company
that he has just formed.

1633
01:17:01,147 --> 01:17:04,417
In six months,
this new construction company

1634
01:17:04,451 --> 01:17:07,921
lands a contract to build
100,000 homes in Iraq.

1635
01:17:07,954 --> 01:17:09,589
<i>And what is
that contract worth?</i>

1636
01:17:09,622 --> 01:17:12,125
About $1.5 billion.

1637
01:17:12,158 --> 01:17:15,428
<i>During this time,
Joe Biden was the point person</i>

1638
01:17:15,462 --> 01:17:17,931
<i>on Iraqi reconstruction.</i>

1639
01:17:17,964 --> 01:17:19,599
Now, there's another
Biden brother.

1640
01:17:19,632 --> 01:17:21,267
I'm Frank Biden.

1641
01:17:21,301 --> 01:17:23,403
I'm the non-attorney
senior advisor

1642
01:17:23,436 --> 01:17:25,038
to clients statewide.

1643
01:17:25,071 --> 01:17:27,006
<i>So, Frank Biden had been</i>

1644
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:30,377
a largely unsuccessful
real estate agent in Florida.

1645
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:32,278
His brother is elected

1646
01:17:32,312 --> 01:17:34,381
vice president
of the United States in 2009.

1647
01:17:34,414 --> 01:17:38,952
And he decides he's going to
get into the energy business.

1648
01:17:38,985 --> 01:17:41,521
<i>His brother,
in the spring of 2009,</i>

1649
01:17:41,554 --> 01:17:43,957
<i>makes a trip to Costa Rica,</i>

1650
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:46,426
<i>meets with Costa Rican
President Arias.</i>

1651
01:17:46,459 --> 01:17:50,029
Within a couple of months,
Frank Biden is in Costa Rica.

1652
01:17:50,063 --> 01:17:52,665
<i>He has meetings with Costa
Rican government officials.</i>

1653
01:17:52,699 --> 01:17:54,434
And he signs an exclusive deal

1654
01:17:54,467 --> 01:17:57,971
with the Costa Rican
national power company

1655
01:17:58,004 --> 01:18:02,509
for green energy projects
in Costa Rica.

1656
01:18:02,542 --> 01:18:05,178
His company, Sun Fund Americas,

1657
01:18:05,211 --> 01:18:08,515
<i>is involved in a project
that includes $47 million</i>

1658
01:18:08,548 --> 01:18:11,217
<i>in taxpayer-backed loans
in Jamaica.</i>

1659
01:18:13,219 --> 01:18:14,721
Let's turn to Hunter Biden.

1660
01:18:14,755 --> 01:18:19,225
In 2013, Hunter Biden
accompanies his father,

1661
01:18:19,259 --> 01:18:22,495
Joe Biden, vice president
of the United States,

1662
01:18:22,529 --> 01:18:24,264
<i>to China.</i>

1663
01:18:24,297 --> 01:18:25,965
<i>Hunter Biden is there</i>

1664
01:18:25,999 --> 01:18:29,135
<i>because he's trying to finalize
this incredible deal.</i>

1665
01:18:29,169 --> 01:18:34,007
It's a private equity deal
expanded to $1.5 billion.

1666
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:36,609
<i>The Chinese government is
putting money into this deal.</i>

1667
01:18:36,643 --> 01:18:41,014
And is it a deal to invest
in the Chinese economy

1668
01:18:41,047 --> 01:18:44,184
in ways that are not typically
open to Western investors?

1669
01:18:44,217 --> 01:18:45,652
Yes. This is the key.

1670
01:18:45,685 --> 01:18:49,255
Hunter Biden has no background
in private equity.

1671
01:18:49,289 --> 01:18:51,458
He has no background in China.

1672
01:18:51,491 --> 01:18:55,528
He gets a deal through
the Shanghai Free Trade Zone

1673
01:18:55,562 --> 01:18:58,531
<i>that nobody else
operating in China has.</i>

1674
01:19:00,033 --> 01:19:02,268
<i>The Chinese have had a strategy</i>

1675
01:19:02,302 --> 01:19:06,039
throughout the Asia-Pacific
region of striking deals

1676
01:19:06,072 --> 01:19:08,041
with the family members
of political figures,

1677
01:19:08,074 --> 01:19:09,676
like Joe Biden,

1678
01:19:09,709 --> 01:19:13,379
because they expect
favorable policies in return.

1679
01:19:13,413 --> 01:19:15,682
And if you look
at Joe Biden's trajectory

1680
01:19:15,715 --> 01:19:19,052
as an official as it relates
to talking about China

1681
01:19:19,085 --> 01:19:21,755
when he was a senator to now,
when he's vice president,

1682
01:19:21,789 --> 01:19:25,291
and then afterward,
he has become incredibly soft

1683
01:19:25,325 --> 01:19:26,760
in his criticism of China.

1684
01:19:26,794 --> 01:19:28,762
It is in our self-interest

1685
01:19:28,796 --> 01:19:30,798
that China continue to prosper.

1686
01:19:30,831 --> 01:19:33,767
And I personally believe
it is directly linked

1687
01:19:33,801 --> 01:19:38,071
to the fact that his son
was doing multiple deals

1688
01:19:38,104 --> 01:19:39,773
with the Chinese government
at the time

1689
01:19:39,807 --> 01:19:42,342
that he was vice president
of the United States.

1690
01:19:42,375 --> 01:19:45,178
<i>Was there a Biden
family racket in Ukraine?</i>

1691
01:19:45,211 --> 01:19:46,579
<i>Oh, absolutely.</i>

1692
01:19:46,613 --> 01:19:49,249
<i>Go back to 2014.
Barack Obama says,</i>

1693
01:19:49,282 --> 01:19:51,785
<i>"I want Joe Biden
to be the point person</i>

1694
01:19:51,819 --> 01:19:55,388
<i>for policy towards Ukraine,"
which means all aid dollars.</i>

1695
01:19:55,421 --> 01:19:57,791
Within three weeks
of that appointment,

1696
01:19:57,825 --> 01:20:01,094
a Ukrainian energy company

1697

starts writing checks
to the vice president's son.

1698
01:20:04,697 --> 01:20:07,534
They were $83,333 a month,

1699
01:20:07,567 --> 01:20:10,169
paid twice,
because both Hunter Biden

1700
01:20:10,203 --> 01:20:14,107
and his business partners
are on the board of directors,

1701
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:17,577
and that amounts to a
million dollars each per year.

1702
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:21,247
These payments started
in the spring of 2014

1703
01:20:21,281 --> 01:20:25,084
and continued, uh,
for almost five years.

1704
01:20:25,118 --> 01:20:27,788
And these 300-page documents
show that's the amount

1705
01:20:27,821 --> 01:20:30,523
that they were paid
consistently every month.

1706
01:20:30,557 --> 01:20:32,692
<i>Now, there was
a Ukrainian prosecutor</i>

1707

1709

We have a tape of Joe Biden
bragging about how he gets

1710
01:20:39,132 --> 01:20:40,600
<i>Mr. Shokin fired.</i>

1711
01:20:40,633 --> 01:20:43,303
W-We're not gonna give you
the billion dollars.

1712
01:20:43,336 --> 01:20:44,738
They said,
"You have no authority.

1713
01:20:44,772 --> 01:20:46,673
You're not the president.
The president said it."

1714
01:20:46,706 --> 01:20:48,241
I said, "Call him."

1715
01:20:48,274 --> 01:20:49,576
I said, "I'm telling you,

1716
01:20:49,609 --> 01:20:51,110
you're not getting
a billion dollars."

1717
01:20:51,144 --> 01:20:52,478
I said, "You're not getting
a billion.

1718
01:20:52,512 --> 01:20:53,747
I'm gonna be leaving here."

1719
01:20:53,781 --> 01:20:55,481
And I think it was, what,
six hours?

1720
01:20:55,515 --> 01:20:57,517
I looked, and I said,
"I'm leaving in six hours.

1721
01:20:57,550 --> 01:21:00,320
If the prosecutor's not fired,
you're not getting the money."

1722
01:21:00,353 --> 01:21:02,488
Well, son of a bitch.

1723
01:21:02,522 --> 01:21:03,857

1735

The one thing
that a totalitarian regime

1736
01:21:56,309 --> 01:21:59,212
cannot allow are citizens
who hold an allegiance

to one higher
than the government.

So, whenever you see that type

coming into play,
the first flashpoint

will always be
religious freedom.

1741
01:22:06,954 --> 01:22:10,590
I have never seen anything
like what we're seeing now.

1742
01:22:10,623 --> 01:22:12,558
Now we're seeing cases
where the government wants

1743
01:22:12,592 --> 01:22:14,694
to force people
to violate their religion.

1744
01:22:14,727 --> 01:22:16,496
I mean,
it's the ultimate intolerance.

1745
01:22:16,529 --> 01:22:18,231
And we've seen it
in lots of examples.

1746
01:22:18,264 --> 01:22:20,768
I mean, the wedding cakes,
the bakers. Uh, there's no...

1747
01:22:20,801 --> 01:22:22,736
Because of the Christian baker
in Colorado

1748
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:24,704
who was forced to bake a cake

1749
01:22:24,738 --> 01:22:27,875
even though he believes
that gay marriage is wrong,

1750
01:22:27,908 --> 01:22:29,642
it violates his conscience,

1751
01:22:29,676 --> 01:22:31,244
but they're gonna
make him do it.

1752
01:22:31,277 --> 01:22:32,846
We have clients from Oregon

1753
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,849
that had the same situation
with custom wedding cakes.

1754
01:22:35,883 --> 01:22:38,786
You'll find that in every case,
they serve everybody.

1755
01:22:38,819 --> 01:22:40,754
They serve every LGBT person.

1756
01:22:40,788 --> 01:22:44,323
It's just when they're asked
to endorse certain messages

1757
01:22:44,357 --> 01:22:46,827
they can't endorse
that there's a problem.

1758
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:49,529
Do you really want
the government to force people

1759
01:22:49,562 --> 01:22:51,497
to say things
they don't want to say?

1760
01:22:51,531 --> 01:22:53,399
Does anybody really believe

1761
01:22:53,433 --> 01:22:56,804
that the government
should punish a Black baker

1762
01:22:56,837 --> 01:22:59,338
because he won't bake a cake
for the Klan rally?

1763
01:22:59,372 --> 01:23:02,275
They're trying to force people
to engage

1764
01:23:02,308 --> 01:23:04,410
in affirmative actions
that violate their conscience.

1765
01:23:04,444 --> 01:23:07,346
Isn't this part
of the political strategy

1766
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:09,549
of the activist left?

1767
01:23:09,582 --> 01:23:11,785
Yeah, it-it's the ultimate
intolerance.

1768
01:23:11,819 --> 01:23:15,956
The idea of trying to use
the power of the government

1769
01:23:15,989 --> 01:23:18,291
to force somebody
who disagrees with you...

1770
01:23:18,324 --> 01:23:20,928
that's as un-American
as anything I can think of.

1771
01:23:20,961 --> 01:23:22,930
To me, the case
of the Bladensburg Cross

1772
01:23:22,963 --> 01:23:27,768
is a perfect representation
of the absurdity.

1773
01:23:27,801 --> 01:23:31,038
Justices on the
U.S. Supreme Court will decide

1774
01:23:31,071 --> 01:23:33,974
whether a cross
on public land in Maryland

1775
01:23:34,007 --> 01:23:35,809
constitutes
an illegal endorsement

1776
01:23:35,843 --> 01:23:37,878
of religion by the government.

1777
01:23:37,911 --> 01:23:40,981
It's a veterans memorial that
was put up almost 100 years ago

1778
01:23:41,014 --> 01:23:43,050
by mothers who lost their sons

1779
01:23:43,083 --> 01:23:45,485
in World War I,
and by the American Legion.

1780
01:23:45,518 --> 01:23:47,386
But then,
come along decades later,

1781
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:48,889
the American Humanists said,
"Hey, wait.

1782
01:23:48,922 --> 01:23:51,491
You can't have this big cross
on government land."

1783
01:23:51,524 --> 01:23:53,359
Separation of church and state.

1784
01:23:53,392 --> 01:23:55,695
And if that point of view
prevailed, couldn't one

1785
01:23:55,728 --> 01:23:57,497
take the same logic
to Arlington Cemetery?

1786
01:23:57,530 --> 01:23:59,599
<i>Absolutely.</i>

1787
01:23:59,632 --> 01:24:01,701
<i>One of the judges said,</i>

1788
01:24:01,735 --> 01:24:04,470
"Why don't we just cut the arms
off the cross?"

1789
01:24:04,504 --> 01:24:06,006
Because, that way,
we can keep it there

1790
01:24:06,039 --> 01:24:08,341
and not have to tear it down,
but, quote,

1791
01:24:08,374 --> 01:24:09,408
"nobody will be offended."

1792
01:24:09,442 --> 01:24:11,677
Well, I think a lot of people
would be offended.

1793
01:24:11,711 --> 01:24:13,814
You would have to go
into every community

1794
01:24:13,847 --> 01:24:16,382
of every state of this country
and tear down the crosses,

it was just the first half.

described themselves

but what they really meant was

are the true descendants</i>

1849
01:26:52,973 --> 01:26:57,010
<i>of Mussolini's Blackshirts
and Hitler's Brownshirts.</i>

1850
01:26:57,044 --> 01:26:59,512
<i>They exploited the injustice
of the killing</i>

1851
01:26:59,545 --> 01:27:01,681
<i>of a Black man, George Floyd,</i>

1852
01:27:01,714 --> 01:27:05,484
<i>to unleash a national wave
of violence and terror.</i>

1853
01:27:07,653 --> 01:27:10,891
<i>Trump declared them a domestic
terrorist organization,</i>

1854
01:27:10,924 --> 01:27:15,594
<i>putting antifa in the same camp
as ISIS and al-Qaeda.</i>

1855
01:27:19,565 --> 01:27:22,535
<i>The near enemy
and the far enemy</i>

1856
01:27:22,568 --> 01:27:24,938
<i>working toward the same end.</i>

1857
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:37,017
<i>The socialist left and the
Democrats want us to grovel,</i>

1858
01:27:37,050 --> 01:27:38,752
<i>to make us into worms.</i>

1859
01:27:38,785 --> 01:27:41,654
<i>They want us to repeat
what they say and believe it,</i>

1860
01:27:41,687 --> 01:27:44,191
<i>even if it's
two plus two equals five.</i>

1861
01:27:45,624 --> 01:27:47,693
<i>The British writer
George Orwell,</i>

1862
01:27:47,727 --> 01:27:51,298
<i>himself a man of the left,
recognized that all forms</i>

1863
01:27:51,331 --> 01:27:54,968
<i>of socialism
become totalitarian.</i>

1864
01:27:55,002 --> 01:27:58,571
<i>In his dystopian novel,</i> 1984,

1865
01:27:58,604 --> 01:28:00,874
<i>lies pass for truth,</i>

1866
01:28:00,907 --> 01:28:02,976
<i>freedom is defined as slavery,</i>

1867
01:28:03,010 --> 01:28:07,147
<i>and the main character,
Winston, is ground into dust</i>

1868
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:12,019
<i>by the all-powerful state,
Big Brother.</i>

1869
01:28:12,052 --> 01:28:14,921
<i>The turning point has come.</i>

1870
01:28:14,955 --> 01:28:17,224
I shall save you.

1871
01:28:17,257 --> 01:28:19,592
I shall make you perfect.

1872
01:28:35,742 --> 01:28:37,878
- That was 40.
- Please.

1873
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:42,149
You see,
the dial goes to a hundred.

1874
01:28:44,650 --> 01:28:46,286
You are clinging to a disease

1875
01:28:46,319 --> 01:28:49,222
under the impression
that it is a virtue.

1876
01:28:49,256 --> 01:28:52,359
You prefer
to be a minority of one.

1877
01:28:52,392 --> 01:28:54,161
You also believe that the nature

1878
01:28:54,194 --> 01:28:57,030
of reality is self-evident,
but I tell you, Winston,

1879
01:28:57,064 --> 01:28:59,698
that reality is not external.

1880
01:28:59,733 --> 01:29:03,669
It does not exist
in the individual mind,

1881
01:29:03,702 --> 01:29:06,807
only in the mind of the state,

1882
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:10,243
which is collective
and immortal.

1883
01:29:14,214 --> 01:29:18,251
Do you remember writing
in your diary

1884
01:29:18,285 --> 01:29:20,387
that freedom
is the freedom to say

1885
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:23,323
that two plus two make four?

1886
01:29:24,357 --> 01:29:26,026
Yes.

1887
01:29:30,696 --> 01:29:33,100
How many fingers
am I holding up, Winston?

1888
01:29:34,201 --> 01:29:35,902
Four.

1889
01:29:35,936 --> 01:29:40,673
And if the state says
this is not four but five,

1890
01:29:40,706 --> 01:29:43,243
then how many fingers?

1891
01:29:46,279 --> 01:29:47,680
Four.

1892
01:29:51,318 --> 01:29:53,420
How many fingers?

1893
01:29:53,453 --> 01:29:55,288
Four.

1894
01:29:58,358 --> 01:30:00,427
Four! Four!

1895
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:02,262
- How many fingers?
- What else can I say?

1896
01:30:04,798 --> 01:30:06,333
How many fingers, Winston?

1897
01:30:06,366 --> 01:30:08,802
- How many fingers, Winston?!
- Five! Five! Five!

1898
01:30:08,835 --> 01:30:10,070
You are only saying that

1899
01:30:10,103 --> 01:30:11,704
because you want
the pain to stop.

1900
01:30:11,738 --> 01:30:13,740
I want to see five!
I'm trying.

1901
01:30:13,773 --> 01:30:15,942
Are you trying to persuade me
that you see five,

1902
01:30:15,976 --> 01:30:17,710
or do you really want
to see five?

1903
01:30:17,744 --> 01:30:19,212
To see them!

1904
01:30:51,311 --> 01:30:54,014
How many fingers
am I holding up, Winston?

1905
01:30:57,350 --> 01:30:59,352
Five.

1906
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:10,197
We are not content
with negative obedience,

1907
01:31:10,230 --> 01:31:13,300
nor even
the most abject submission.

1908
01:31:13,333 --> 01:31:16,336
When finally
you surrender to us,

1909
01:31:16,369 --> 01:31:19,406
it must be
of your own free will.

1910
01:31:24,077 --> 01:31:26,780
Before we end the session,

1911
01:31:26,813 --> 01:31:29,149
do you have any questions?

1912
01:31:33,453 --> 01:31:35,422
It is switched off.

1913
01:31:35,455 --> 01:31:37,457
Do you have a question?

1914
01:31:41,394 --> 01:31:43,163
What is two plus two?

1915
01:31:43,196 --> 01:31:45,799
Whatever the state says it is.

1916
01:31:45,832 --> 01:31:47,801
Anything else?

1917
01:31:48,868 --> 01:31:50,403
Does Big Brother exist?

1918
01:31:50,437 --> 01:31:51,905
Of course he exists.

1919
01:31:51,938 --> 01:31:54,074
The state exists.

1920
01:31:54,107 --> 01:31:57,310
Big Brother is the embodiment
of the state.

1921
01:31:57,344 --> 01:32:01,982
Does he exist in the same way
that I exist?

1922
01:32:06,253 --> 01:32:09,222
You do not exist.

1923
01:32:22,369 --> 01:32:25,238
Want a vision
of the future, Winston?

1924
01:32:25,272 --> 01:32:27,440
Imagine a boot...

1925
01:32:27,474 --> 01:32:30,477
stamping a human face...

1926
01:32:30,510 --> 01:32:32,512

You're hitting a guy
over the head with a bat!

2006
01:37:39,452 --> 01:37:41,354
- Uh, Driggs and Metropolitan.
- Is that man okay?

2007
01:37:41,387 --> 01:37:43,590
Marla, call the police.

2008
01:37:45,525 --> 01:37:48,127
<i>My whole life,
I've been a fighter, and now</i>

2009
01:37:48,161 --> 01:37:50,530
I'm going to fight for you.
We're gonna fight.

2010
01:37:50,563 --> 01:37:54,300
<i>He fights because
he knows what's at stake.</i>

2011
01:37:54,334 --> 01:37:58,404
<i>America's the place
where anyone can rise.</i>

2012
01:37:58,438 --> 01:38:02,208
<i>And here on this land,
on this soil,</i>

2013
01:38:02,241 --> 01:38:04,410
<i>on this continent,</i>

2014
01:38:04,444 --> 01:38:07,313
<i>the most incredible dreams
come true.</i>

2015
01:38:07,347 --> 01:38:09,917
<i>This nation is our canvas,</i>

2016
01:38:09,950 --> 01:38:13,252
<i>and this country is
our masterpiece.</i>

2017
01:38:13,286 --> 01:38:18,291
<i>We look at tomorrow
and see unlimited frontiers</i>

2018
01:38:18,324 --> 01:38:20,627
<i>just waiting to be explored.</i>

2019
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:25,264
<i>Our brightest discoveries
are not yet known.</i>

2020
01:38:25,298 --> 01:38:27,200
<i>Our spirit is still young.</i>

2021
01:38:27,233 --> 01:38:30,203
<i>The sun is still rising.</i>

2022
01:38:30,236 --> 01:38:33,239
<i>God's grace is still shining.</i>

2023
01:38:33,272 --> 01:38:35,608
<i>And, my fellow Americans,</i>

2024
01:38:35,642 --> 01:38:39,412
<i>the best is yet to come.</i>

2025
01:38:39,445 --> 01:38:41,280
<i>With Trump as our leader,</i>

2026
01:38:41,314 --> 01:38:45,218
<i>we will leave socialism
on the ash heap of history.</i>

2027
01:38:46,854 --> 01:38:50,723
This man is fighting for us,
so I will continue

2028
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:54,360
to fight for him and to fight
for what is right.

2029
01:38:54,394 --> 01:38:55,595
Are you gonna give up?

2030
01:38:55,628 --> 01:38:56,663
Absolutely not.

2031
01:38:56,696 --> 01:38:58,564
America's worth fighting for.

2032
01:38:58,598 --> 01:39:00,801
America is just not worth
fighting for.

2033
01:39:00,834 --> 01:39:04,570
I think it's worth
even dying for.

2034
01:39:04,604 --> 01:39:05,906
I will never give up,

2035
01:39:05,939 --> 01:39:08,241
because life is worth
fighting for.

2036
01:39:08,274 --> 01:39:11,310
I've never been more encouraged
about what I see happening.

2037
01:39:11,344 --> 01:39:13,279
The fact that I see us winning.

2038
01:39:13,312 --> 01:39:17,383
America was founded
on liberty and independence,

2039
01:39:17,417 --> 01:39:19,853
and not government coercion,

2040
01:39:19,887 --> 01:39:22,422
domination and control.

2041
01:39:22,455 --> 01:39:25,692
We are born free,
and we will stay free.
