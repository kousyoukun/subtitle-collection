1
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,239
- Mamma?
- Yes, my child?

2
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,179
Why am I not a bird?

3
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,712
- A bird?
- Yes, a bird.

4
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,086
What do you mean, my daughter?

5
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,884
Why can't I fly like a bird?

6
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,560
Because you are not a bird.
Because you are you.

7
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,029
What if I was a bird?

8
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,259
You're not a bird.

9
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,412
But if I was a bird...

10
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,414
if you were a bird, we could fly...

11
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,716
and be there quickly
and not have to walk so far.

12
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,623
Well, you are not a bird, my daughter.

13
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,631
Yes. But why?

14
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:30,400
Beauty, you ask too many questions.

15
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,291
Hello.

16
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,884
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

17
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,486
We are looking for the village of Rooihoek.

18
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,193
I am from that village. It's that way.

19
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,167
How far is it?

20
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,397
Not too far. But not close, either.

21
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,141
We have been traveling for about two hours.

22
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,575
- Two hours?
- Yes.

23
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,640
Is there a school there?

24
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,681
A school?

25
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,440
We are teachers.

26
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,543
In search of a school where we can teach.

27
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,645
We have been looking for a long time.

28
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,155
How long?

29
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,590
Two years. And a bit.

30
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,088
Two years? That is a long time.

31
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,357
Do they need teachers in your village?

32
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,325
I don't know. You shall have to ask.

33
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,765
Thank you.

34
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,566
If it is as far as you say,
then we best be going.

35
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,539
Go well.

36
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:42,927
Hello.

37
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,298
- Is this the queue to see the doctor?
- Yes.

38
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,806
Thank you.

39
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,933
Where are you from?

40
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,534
- Rooihoek.
- Rooihoek?

41
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,170
That is far.

42
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,305
Yes, it is far.

43
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,377
Have you been waiting long?

44
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:05,446
Since 7:00 this morning.

45
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,155
- So early?
- Yes.

46
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,760
But there are still so many to go.

47
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,232
Yes. It is better to come early.

48
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,795
Will the doctor see us today?

49
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,927
The doctor will only be able to see people...

50
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,435
up to here.

51
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:28,037
The rest of you will have to go home...

52
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,209
and come back next week.

53
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:42,085
I told you. It is best to come early.

54
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,255
Before the sun.

55
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:45,922
You see...

56
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,654
we've waited a long time.

57
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,959
We've been here for so long.

58
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,866
Mamma, when is Daddy
coming home again?

59
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,663
Only next month, my child, on the 25th.

60
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,376
- Is that a lot of days?
- Yes, that's a lot of days.

61
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,939
Do you think he will buy a motor car?

62
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,945
- A motor car?
- Yes, a motor car.

63
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,746
Motor cars cost a lot of money.

64
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,514
How much is a motor car?

65
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,017
A lot.

66
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,114
How much is a lot?

67
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,789
A lot lot.

68
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,521
Anyway, I thought you wanted to be a bird?

69
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,223
I know, but a motor car would be fine.

70
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:40,302
Have you heard? Kunene's widow
got four numbers in the lotto.

71
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,065
- Four?
- Yes.

72
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:45,075
She paid a visit to the sangoma
who told her to play number seven.

73
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,475
She did and it worked.
It was one of the four numbers.

74
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,979
How much did she win?

75
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,276
One hundred and twenty rands.

76
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,043
Is that all?

77
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,615
I thought you won a lot of money
if you got four numbers.

78
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,485
It has to be all six.

79
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,855
She only got four.

80
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,828
How much do you get for six numbers?

81
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,496
A million rand!

82
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,298
Sometimes two million.

83
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,937
- A million rand?
- Yes.

84
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,700
For six numbers?

85
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,435
Imagine, such a lot of money.

86
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,443
What would you do if you won a million?

87
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:20,978
I don't play.

88
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,172
Yes, but if you did?

89
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,549
I don't know.

90
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,416
Turn Beauty into a bird.

91
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,848
What do you mean?

92
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,325
Nothing. Goodbye.

93
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,654
What did the doctor say?

94
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,890
I did not see him.

95
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,492
But you went to the clinic?

96
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,599
Yes, but it was full.
I have to go back next Tuesday.

97
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,344
Perhaps you will be feeling better by then.

98
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,276
Perhaps.

99
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,637
Hello.

100
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,908
Hello.

101
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,176
Have you heard about Kunene's widow?

102
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,319
Four numbers! I've heard.

103
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,099
- Mamma?
- Yes, my child?

104
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,861
Where does the river go?

105
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,434
What do you mean?

106
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:54,370
Where does it start and where does it end?

107
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,575
It starts in the mountains...

108
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,236
and ends in the sea. I think.

109
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,446
In the sea! It goes all the way to the sea?

110
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,680
I think so.

111
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:10,381
How does the river flow...

112
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,250
between here and the sea?

113
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:17,719
Does it go up the mountain?

114
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,326
No. Water can't go up a mountain.
Only down.

115
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,465
So it won't reach the sea?

116
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,172
Not if there is a mountain in the way.

117
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,206
Then it won't reach the sea.

118
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,436
Now enough of all these questions!

119
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,537
There is still a lot to wash.

120
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:38,777
Pass me the board.

121
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,085
Be careful.

122
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:38,336
Don't look so frightened, my child.
It is only a cough.

123
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,402
We need to start planting before it gets dark.

124
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,140
Get the seeds quickly.

125
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,980
Mamma. I am hungry.

126
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,620
I'm hungry.

127
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,986
Should I peel an orange for you?

128
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,450
Here you go.

129
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,328
Thank you.

130
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,251
The doctor can only see up to here.

131
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,081
The rest of you, go home.

132
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,815
Please. I'm from Rooihoek.

133
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,088
I have to see the doctor today.

134
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:44,788
I'm sorry, but she can only see up to here.
You will have to come back next week.

135
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,296
But I am sick.

136
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:50,129
I am sorry. There is nothing I can do.
Come back next week.

137
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,738
Hello again.

138
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,671
Hello. Where is your friend?

139
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:34,007
She's lucky.
They needed a teacher in your village.

140
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,739
- You are from Rooihoek, aren't you?
- Yes.

141
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:40,314
- What about you?
- I was not so lucky.

142
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,280
What will you do?

143
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:47,959
Keep looking until I find some luck, too.

144
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,855
I hope you find it soon.

145
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,955
Look after my friend. She is a good woman.

146
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,032
And a good teacher, too.

147
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,076
Are you all right?

148
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,050
I am fine.

149
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,214
Are you sure?

150
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,619
I'm sure. I'm trying to see the doctor.

151
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,024
I am fine.

152
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,720
- Go well then.
- Go well!

153
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:40,638
This is the only pump in the village,
but the water is good.

154
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,138
Also, if anything's happening
in the village...

155
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,512
this is where you can find out about it first.

156
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,414
The Chief will never allow it.

157
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,249
You know what happened the last time
one of our men married...

158
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,380
a girl from the Misamangu clan.

159
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,957
There was a war for three years.

160
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:57,485
See?

161
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,855
Well, the white flag is flying high...

162
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,364
and proud above his hut.

163
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:03,196
And proud above his hut.

164
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:07,503
He must like his new wife very much.

165
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,807
I have never seen a flag so high.

166
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,403
Not only a white flag, I hear.

167
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,312
A red one, too.

168
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,944
He's a cheeky boy, that one.

169
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,249
It's not enough that he's causing problems
by wanting...

170
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,586
to get married
to one of Misamangu's daughters...

171
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,354
but he's already advertising
for another wife.

172
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,689
Exactly!

173
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,929
He must have a spear between his legs.

174
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:43,337
I don't like it. Trouble is all I see.

175
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,637
What do you say, Yesterday?

176
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,615
If they are in love, they are in love.

177
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,283
There's nothing much
anyone can do about it.

178
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,091
Look here.

179
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:06,396
It's true, he likes the ladies
too much, that one.

180
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,836
Thank you for walking with me.

181
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,936
We can go together again tomorrow.
I fetch water every day.

182
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,635
- I'll see you tomorrow then.
- Thank you.

183
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,163
She's playing down in the field.

184
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,936
Thank you.

185
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,146
Mamma, wake up!

186
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,629
Mamma, wake up!

187
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:54,828
Mamma, wake up!

188
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,470
Somebody please help me!

189
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,352
Tell me...

190
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,757
how long have you had
this falling sickness?

191
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:16,891
This is the first time.

192
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,719
The first time?

193
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:23,363
I have been trying to see the doctor.
I have not been well these past few weeks.

194
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:25,366
The doctor?

195
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,631
At the clinic in Kromdraai.

196
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,808
Why did you not come and see me?

197
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,106
And what did the doctor say?

198
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,343
I have not seen him yet.

199
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,218
Not seen him?

200
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:45,415
It is difficult.
There are always so many people.

201
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,089
And still you did not come to see me?

202
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,089
No matter. I'll examine you.

203
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,425
Blow.

204
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:04,467
If you do not trust me,
you should not have come.

205
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,743
You should have waited until the day,
whenever that day arrives...

206
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:11,042
that the doctors at the clinic
decide to see you.

207
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:12,776
Do you understand?

208
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,751
Now blow three times.

209
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:34,371
There is too much anger.

210
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,803
You must let go of the anger.

211
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,078
I am not angry.

212
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,904
You are. I can feel it.

213
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:47,314
Here, here and here.
You carry it on your shoulders.

214
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,045
I am not angry.

215
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,118
I cannot help you...

216
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:56,350
if you do not let the anger out of your body.

217
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,358
But I am not angry.

218
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:05,531
You see how it makes you sick?

219
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,874
What do I have to be angry about?

220
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:13,635
Why do you ask me this?

221
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,371
I am not angry.

222
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,451
I can treat you...

223
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:23,680
but if you do not let this anger go,
then it may not work.

224
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,586
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

225
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,537
Inhale.

226
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,962
Hello.

227
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:11,766
I heard what happened.

228
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,769
I heard you collapsed.

229
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:20,902
I came to see
if there's anything I can do for you.

230
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:24,748
You are very kind. But I am fine.

231
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,648
- Would you like tea?
- If it is no trouble.

232
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,414
No trouble at all.

233
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,798
I have no sugar.

234
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:45,131
That's fine. I like it bitter.

235
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:55,813
What did the Sangoma say?

236
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,682
- Did she help you?
- I don't know.

237
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,746
Perhaps you are a diabetic?

238
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:06,416
A what?

239
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:10,824
It's to do with your sugar levels.
Maybe they are too low?

240
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:12,662
Sugar levels?

241
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:17,825
Some people, if their sugar levels
are too low, they collapse.

242
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,471
I would not know.
You are the teacher, not me.

243
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,003
You should see a doctor.

244
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,309
I am trying. I am trying.

245
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,212
But it is far to the clinic
and I always get there too late.

246
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,680
We shall have to arrange something.

247
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,620
You could take the taxi.

248
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:43,361
That is a waste of money.

249
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,597
But it is only five rand.

250
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,828
A waste of money. It is better to walk.

251
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,052
- Good morning.
- What is going on?

252
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:11,452
- It's Tuesday.
- So?

253
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:14,957
So the taxi is ready to take you
to the clinic in Kromdraai.

254
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,961
Don't worry, it is already paid for.

255
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:21,064
Hurry up and get dressed.
You will be the first one there.

256
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,566
I must wake up Beauty first and...

257
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,168
Get dressed. I'll look after her.

258
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:06,936
Thank you.

259
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:10,947
I cannot wait.
Who knows how long you will be?

260
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,779
I understand. Thank you, again.

261
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:42,739
Yesterday, is it?

262
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:45,079
Yes, madam.

263
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,878
I've had a Tomorrow and a Today even.

264
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,817
But never a Yesterday.

265
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,651
Who named you that?

266
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:54,992
My father, madam.

267
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:58,191
He said that things were better yesterday
than they are today.

268
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,526
But that was a long time ago.

269
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:04,599
You don't have to call me madam.
I am a doctor.

270
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:05,964
Yes, madam.

271
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,639
How long have you had this cough?

272
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,879
Since before Christmas, madam.

273
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,017
Before Christmas?

274
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,451
Why have you left it so long?

275
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,693
I thought it would go away.

276
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:36,958
And when it didn't, it was hard to see you.

277
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,601
I know. I am sorry.

278
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:44,099
We need more than one doctor at this clinic.

279
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,804
But there is not enough money.

280
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:49,875
Take a deep breath.

281
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,478
Like this.

282
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:01,783
Good.

283
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,966
Is there something wrong with me, madam?

284
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:29,885
I would like to do a blood test.

285
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,256
A blood test?

286
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,952
I need to draw some blood...

287
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,460
and send it for testing.

288
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,559
I don't understand.

289
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:45,769
Just to check that everything is fine.

290
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,340
But first, you have to sign your consent.

291
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:03,651
I need your consent.
Just read it through and sign it.

292
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:07,718
Here. Put your name here.

293
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:28,974
What's the matter?

294
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:32,915
I cannot read or write, madam.

295
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:37,984
It doesn't matter.

296
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:39,822
Do you want the test?

297
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,225
Will it hurt?

298
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,888
Don't worry.

299
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:47,863
Just a tiny little prick and it'll be all over.

300
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:20,020
Just relax. Look the other way.

301
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,310
Hello.

302
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,585
How are you?

303
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,053
Fine. Fine.

304
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:29,261
- How are you, my child?
- I'm fine.

305
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,597
Does Teacher know where you are?

306
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,000
She was busy with lots of papers.

307
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,268
You must go and tell her I am here. Hurry.

308
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,486
What are you doing?

309
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:04,697
- What are you doing?
- Nothing, my child.

310
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,996
Here, go and throw this away for me.

311
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,970
Did you hurt yourself?

312
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,276
Run along.

313
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,099
- What's this for?
- The taxi.

314
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:13,235
Don't be silly. It was my pleasure.

315
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:16,339
But you don't have to pay for me.

316
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:25,176
I told you, it's my pleasure.

317
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,586
I'll make it up to you.

318
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,382
You already have.

319
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:36,957
- I have?
- By being my friend.

320
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:41,896
- It is not easy to make friends in this village.
- That is true.

321
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,860
When I married my husband...

322
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,973
it took at least a year
before they accepted me.

323
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:55,574
For some reason they are very suspicious
of outsiders in this village.

324
00:36:57,148 --> 00:37:00,948
- Where is your husband?
- He works in Johannesburg.

325
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:03,344
How often do you see him?

326
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:08,688
Sometimes once a month.

327
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,455
Sometimes not for many months.

328
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:15,691
- It is hard.
- Yes. It is hard.

329
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:19,628
So, what did the doctor say?

330
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,334
She took my blood.

331
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:28,338
- She? It was a woman doctor?
- Yes. A white woman doctor.

332
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,681
She speaks like a proper Zulu, too.

333
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:36,181
- A proper Zulu?
- Like you and me.

334
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,055
What did she take blood for?

335
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,090
I do not know.
I have to go back next Tuesday.

336
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:49,160
Tell me when,
and I shall look after Beauty again.

337
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:53,103
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

338
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:55,331
She is a bright child, that one.

339
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:57,230
She should start school soon.

340
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,239
Next year.

341
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,037
I look forward to teaching her.

342
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,467
I do not understand.

343
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:32,075
Do you use a condom?

344
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:37,378
- What?
- Condoms, do you use them?

345
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,111
What for?

346
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:45,450
I am a married woman.
Why would I want to use those?

347
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:51,088
So, you only have sex with your husband?

348
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:52,787
Yes.

349
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:57,222
And does he have other wives?

350
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,165
I am his only wife.

351
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,969
And where is he, your husband?

352
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:10,239
He works in Johannesburg.
Under the ground.

353
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,010
- Under the ground?
- In the mines.

354
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,109
When last did you see him?

355
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:20,353
On New Year's Day. Then he had to go back.

356
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:21,884
I see.

357
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:25,625
And do you enjoy...

358
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,195
a normal, healthy sex life?

359
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,099
Do you have sex?

360
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:37,932
Yes.

361
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:41,707
You know what men are like
after they have been away for a long time.

362
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:43,143
I know.

363
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:50,546
It is important that I test him
as soon as possible.

364
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,958
Test him? But he's in Johannesburg.

365
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:58,923
- Which mine?
- I don't know.

366
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:02,190
- Can you find out?
- I will try.

367
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,459
It is important.

368
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,436
So now...

369
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,268
What?

370
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,940
Am I going to stop living?

371
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:42,525
Hello.

372
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,031
Hello, can you hear me?

373
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,824
Hello.

374
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:46,254
What a surprise!

375
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,599
I hope you don't mind me coming here.

376
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,464
Of course not! I was just about to leave.

377
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,463
I need to ask you something.

378
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:59,240
Come. You walk me home.

379
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,646
Can I help you with that?

380
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,247
You are so kind.

381
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:16,151
But I need to ask another favor.

382
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:18,190
You only have to ask.

383
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:21,596
I need to go away for a few days.

384
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:22,823
Go away?

385
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,393
- To Johannesburg.
- What for?

386
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:30,400
I cannot say. I need someone
to look after Beauty while I am away.

387
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:40,306
Is there something wrong?

388
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,223
No problem.

389
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:53,552
Like I said, I think your daughter
is a wonderful child.

390
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:55,593
It will be my pleasure.

391
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:58,099
Thank you very much. Thank you.

392
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,571
Be good, my child.

393
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:13,373
- When are you coming back?
- I'll only be gone a day or two.

394
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:16,711
- You promise?
- I promise.

395
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,385
Come here.

396
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,190
Be a good girl, okay?

397
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,028
Your mommy will be back
before you know it.

398
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:05,095
Come, let us go and bake some bread.

399
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:09,416
Hello.

400
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:14,658
I'm looking for my husband, John Khumalo.

401
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,492
- He works here?
- Yes.

402
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:19,633
Which section?

403
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,698
Section?

404
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:30,042
On top or under the ground?

405
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:34,340
Underneath. I need to see him.

406
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:36,884
What's it about?

407
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:40,281
I cannot say. I need to see him urgently.

408
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:52,626
- John Khumalo, you say?
- Yes.

409
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:58,798
- And you are?
- His wife, Yesterday.

410
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:02,272
- Yesterday?
- Yes.

411
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:07,942
Wait here and I shall find out for you.

412
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:09,344
Thank you.

413
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,002
What do you want?

414
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,680
- Has something happened to Beauty?
- No, she is fine.

415
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,484
- If it's money...
- It's not money.

416
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:20,785
It's you I've come to see.

417
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,358
- Me?
- Yes.

418
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,291
Me?

419
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:34,733
Why do you want to see me?

420
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:47,803
Go back to sleep.

421
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:50,580
I don't want to.

422
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:53,215
It's okay, your father will be here,
when you wake up.

423
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:54,977
Really?

424
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:33,383
Open it.

425
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,870
Do you like it?

426
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:59,043
This is the best gift you've ever given me.

427
00:53:38,315 --> 00:53:39,646
Hello.

428
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:44,017
- It's hard to turn.
- Let me try.

429
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:50,956
There we are!

430
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,822
Thank you.

431
00:53:58,668 --> 00:53:59,657
Yes?

432
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:02,835
You don't look well.

433
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:06,835
I'm fine. Just a little tired.

434
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:10,479
Are you still getting your medicine
from the clinic?

435
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:12,509
Yes.

436
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:16,377
Well, it doesn't seem to be working.

437
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:20,647
Perhaps, you should go back
to the sangoma instead?

438
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:24,423
I'm just tired. That's all.

439
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:28,430
If you say so.

440
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,396
Thank you.

441
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:35,627
Let me help you.

442
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:44,237
Thank you.

443
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:37,492
In the men's hostel...

444
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:43,663
I used to run to the toilet all the time.

445
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,399
Every five minutes.

446
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,838
But there are no toilets...

447
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:02,110
under the ground.

448
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:11,020
Not where I work...

449
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,521
blasting the rock...

450
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,067
going deeper into the earth.

451
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:27,567
What else could I do?

452
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:32,076
I messed in my pants, over and over...

453
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:36,781
until they were wet and sticking to my legs.

454
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,356
I stank like an animal.

455
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:45,918
No one would come near me.

456
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:57,395
I did not want to believe what you told me.

457
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,244
I did not.

458
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:09,844
But...

459
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:14,646
it kept playing over and over in my mind.

460
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:18,284
Over and over, driving me crazy.

461
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:29,029
And the shitting would not stop.

462
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:34,904
Until my shift boss had had enough
and made me go to the doctor.

463
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:43,479
The doctor...

464
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:48,287
did tests.

465
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:57,456
And he said just like you said.

466
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:40,034
I hear your husband is back.

467
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:44,142
I hear he is sick.

468
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,345
What's the matter with him?

469
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:50,950
Tell me, when is he going back to work?

470
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:57,085
Why doesn't he come out of the house?
No one has seen him for days.

471
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:02,257
I hear things are not so good.

472
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:21,775
I must say, Yesterday,
you're doing very well.

473
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,016
Very well?

474
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,046
Your body is strong.

475
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,924
It is keeping the disease in check.

476
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:32,554
It is not my body.

477
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:37,126
It is here.

478
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,433
I have made up my mind.

479
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:44,965
How so?

480
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,603
Until my child goes to school...

481
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:52,180
I'll not die.

482
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,982
Your child?

483
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:00,982
Yes. My daughter, Beauty...

484
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:03,448
starts school next year.

485
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:08,453
I can't wait for that day.

486
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:14,163
Only then can this "thing" take me away.

487
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:18,205
No. I will not die till that day.

488
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:22,543
But my husband...

489
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:25,476
he is in great pain.

490
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:30,241
Is there nothing you can do for him?
Is there no medicine that you can give him?

491
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:33,688
I'll see what I've got.

492
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:45,622
- I am sorry.
- For what?

493
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:55,898
For...

494
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:06,674
Forget all of that.

495
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:09,184
That is all in the past.

496
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:11,277
You need to rest.

497
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:16,123
Rest now.

498
01:04:57,927 --> 01:05:00,953
- May I come in?
- Of course, come in.

499
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:10,794
- I am not disturbing you?
- I am making dinner.

500
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,471
Who is it?

501
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:15,404
No one.

502
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:22,950
There is an urgent matter I need to discuss.

503
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:24,680
What is it?

504
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:29,086
- May we speak outside?
- Yes.

505
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:37,156
Come.

506
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,363
I wish the summer would hurry up.

507
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:51,041
I thought you should know
that everyone in the village is talking.

508
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:57,017
- Talking? About what?
- About your husband.

509
01:05:57,887 --> 01:05:59,718
What are they saying about him?

510
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,084
They say...

511
01:06:03,826 --> 01:06:05,157
he has the virus.

512
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:06,886
H.I.V.

513
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:12,558
- Is it true?
- It is true.

514
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:19,067
- I have it, too.
- You?

515
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:23,436
But why did you not say anything?

516
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:27,079
You heard what happened
to that woman in Bergville?

517
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:28,411
No.

518
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:34,317
There was this young woman. Very clever.

519
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:37,185
So much so that her whole village
helped save money...

520
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:39,784
to send her to university in Johannesburg.

521
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:42,794
She went there.
She was going to be a somebody.

522
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,660
But, she got AIDS.

523
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:52,303
And when she came home
to tell her mother and father...

524
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:54,303
everyone found out.

525
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:58,671
You know what happened?

526
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:06,312
They killed her.

527
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:09,589
Killed her?

528
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:12,889
They threw stones at her until she was dead.

529
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:14,758
Oh, my God.

530
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:18,327
- Is this true?
- It is true.

531
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:28,208
How long have you known?

532
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:33,414
Since the summer.

533
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:36,280
Since the summer?

534
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:43,657
What are you going to do?

535
01:08:02,211 --> 01:08:04,611
He should not be able to stay here!

536
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:07,407
He will make us all sick.

537
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:12,319
No, no. He cannot make you sick.
That is not how it works.

538
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:15,212
- How, then?
- It is transmitted through blood.

539
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:17,848
Blood? What do you mean blood?

540
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:19,957
It lives in the blood...

541
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:25,260
and you can only get it
if it is transmitted into your blood.

542
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:29,831
"Transmitted"? What does "transmitted"
mean? You are confusing me now.

543
01:08:30,139 --> 01:08:34,508
Passed into your blood.
By transfusion or sex.

544
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:38,180
Sex!

545
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:43,747
Which is why he must go.
What if he bleeds all over us?

546
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,521
Hey, come on now! Be reasonable.

547
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,215
How is that going to happen?

548
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:51,657
Be reasonable? Hey, listen here!

549
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:55,628
My daughter was playing there
the other day and she saw him.

550
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:59,462
She says that he is so thin
that the wind could blow him over.

551
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:06,939
What is so funny?
There is nothing to laugh about.

552
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:10,107
I will not let my daughter play there again.

553
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:12,703
Me, neither. He must go.

554
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:20,781
Your husbands are bringing it to you.

555
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:23,487
Yes, we get it from them.

556
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:26,425
You must see how she coughs. There she is.

557
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:20,074
As you can see,
we are already overcrowded.

558
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:24,514
There is no place for your husband.
He will have to go on the waiting list.

559
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:29,519
I'd like to help you, but it's out of my hands.

560
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:37,029
What about the one over there?
That bed is empty now.

561
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:40,295
That bed will be filled by tonight.

562
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:42,730
There is a waiting list...

563
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:45,898
as long as my arm. Both arms.

564
01:10:46,842 --> 01:10:49,538
You do not understand.
My husband is very sick.

565
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:52,842
The people in the village are angry.
They want him gone.

566
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:56,115
Come. We shall put his name
on the waiting list.

567
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:57,611
Come.

568
01:11:08,664 --> 01:11:11,599
What's going on? Just leave us alone!

569
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:19,835
Tell me, is this what causes your anger?

570
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:22,834
I am not angry.

571
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:35,549
Let's go.

572
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:47,728
Stop that!

573
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:49,896
Sorry, Mamma.

574
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:06,208
Mamma, people are coming.

575
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:15,619
Hello.

576
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,685
- What are you doing?
- I am trying to get this bonnet off.

577
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:22,029
- What for?
- I need it.

578
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:25,829
- Would you like us to help you?
- That would make me very happy!

579
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:31,406
Come, let's help her.

580
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:20,677
- They say you are building a hut?
- That's right, I am.

581
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:23,915
- What are you building it for?
- My husband.

582
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:28,857
Your husband?

583
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:31,626
The hospital is full,
so I have to build my own hospital.

584
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,704
- Your own hospital?
- It's what they want, isn't it?

585
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:41,401
I shall move him and look after him there.

586
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:43,406
- But...
- But what?

587
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:45,772
They don't want him in the village.

588
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:48,915
No matter how long it takes, I shall do this.

589
01:14:50,285 --> 01:14:51,946
You are very brave!

590
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:53,849
I am not brave.

591
01:14:53,956 --> 01:14:56,720
It is just the way things are.

592
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:17,738
We're almost done.

593
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:55,564
I need to rest.

594
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:56,895
Rest.

595
01:17:57,472 --> 01:17:59,997
- How can this be?
- What?

596
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:09,610
Your daddy...

597
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:14,519
used to play in this field
when he was your age.

598
01:18:21,596 --> 01:18:23,359
Used to run free...

599
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,924
as a leopard...

600
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:35,901
But now, I can't even walk...

601
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:38,476
half a kilometer.

602
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:41,312
It is not far to go now.

603
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:44,413
It is too far.

604
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:29,809
Beauty.

605
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:38,356
No, it's Yesterday.

606
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:50,163
Hello.

607
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:58,863
I have seen you come here every day,
since the winter.

608
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:03,505
I never knew your husband.

609
01:23:07,082 --> 01:23:10,415
He was a very good man.

610
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:14,148
He did his best for us.

611
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:18,051
I could ask for no more, really.

612
01:23:28,903 --> 01:23:31,064
School starts next week.

613
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:34,174
I know.

614
01:23:34,776 --> 01:23:36,676
Is Beauty excited?

615
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:39,242
Yes. Me, too.

616
01:23:40,315 --> 01:23:41,612
You are?

617
01:23:42,484 --> 01:23:44,475
I never went to school.

618
01:23:47,155 --> 01:23:48,281
I see.

619
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:02,701
I just want you to know...

620
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,199
when the end comes...

621
01:24:06,307 --> 01:24:10,607
I shall love your daughter
as if she were my own.

622
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:12,770
Thank you.

623
01:25:56,784 --> 01:25:59,048
Come and see what I brought you.

624
01:25:59,187 --> 01:26:00,654
Yes, Mamma.

625
01:26:08,763 --> 01:26:10,628
Come, sit next to me.

626
01:26:10,965 --> 01:26:12,865
Open it and see.

627
01:26:29,651 --> 01:26:31,278
Mamma, it's beautiful!

628
01:26:31,586 --> 01:26:32,883
- Do you like it?
- Yes!

629
01:26:32,987 --> 01:26:34,921
Do you like it a lot?

630
01:26:40,595 --> 01:26:42,085
It's going to look nice on me.

631
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,097
Yes, it's going to look lovely.

632
01:28:44,098 --> 01:28:46,898
