1
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,430
有史以来  兽族和人类之间的战争
There has been a war between orcs and humans

2
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,490
就从未停止
for as long as can be remembered.

3
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,310
但曾经
But there was once a time,

4
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,950
我们都不知道自己的敌人是谁
when we did not even know who our enemy was.

5
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,140
也不明白那种绿色的邪恶魔法
Or what that evil green magic, the fel,

6
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,380
对我们做了什么
had done to us.

7
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,570
但在一开始  我们怎么知道
But in the beginning, how could we have known.

8
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,060
我们又有什么办法
What choice did we have?

9
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,950
我们的世界就要毁灭了
Our world was dying.

10
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,070
而我必须为族人们找到新家
And I had to find my clan a new home.

11
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,820
杜隆坦
Durotan.

12
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,810
我能感觉到你在看我
I can feel your eyes.

13
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,550
我以为你睡着了
I thought you were asleep.

14
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,750
是啊
I was.

15
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,920
梦见在雪中捕猎的场景
Dreaming of a hunt, through the snow.

16
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,300
我想到一个名字
I thought of a name.

17
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,250
那么  别说出来  亲爱的
Well. Keep it to yourself, wife.

18
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,770
当我见到儿子就知道取什么名儿了
I'll choose a name when I meet him.

19
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,730
或是丫头
Or her.

20
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,870
好吧
Oh.

21
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,340
要是我不跟着你一起去的话
And how will the great Durotan name his son?

22
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,670
咱儿子能有个什么好名字
If I do not travel with him.

23
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,100
是儿子
A son?

24
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,840
你这大肚子真能藏东西啊
Can you hide your fat belly?

25
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,990
好过你那大脑袋里什么都没有
Better than you can hide your fat head.

26
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,700
竟然来了这么多氏族  奥格瑞姆
So many clans in one place, Orgrim.

27
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,940
嘲颅氏族  黑石氏族
Laughingskull. Blackrock.

28
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,030
全被召集来了
All have been summoned.

29
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,270
这会是个强大的军团
It will be a mighty warband.

30
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,410
但真正留下来能打仗的又有几个
I just wonder who's left to fight?

31
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,650
不胜利  毋宁死
Lok'tar ogar!

32
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,890
不胜利  毋宁死
Victory or death!

33
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,510
黑石氏族的  去那边
Blackrock, over there.

34
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,210
还要多久  黑手
How much longer, Blackhand?

35
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,680
我们一切就绪  古尔丹
We are ready, Gul'dan.

36
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,450
帮帮我（兽人语）
Help me.

37
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,210
我的孩子  请让他走吧（兽语）
My child. Please let him go.

38
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,870
我求你了（兽人语）
I beg you.

39
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,490
她刚才说什么
What did she say?

40
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,160
她恳求您放过她的孩子
She begs for you to free her child.

41
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,190
可他不能少  一个都不许少
But I need him. I need all of them.

42
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,690
快走  半兽人
Move, half breed.

43
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,810
那是什么  古尔丹的魔法
- What is that? - Gul'dan's magic.

44
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:24,260
我魔法的力量  源于生命
The fuel of my magic is life.

45
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,500
现在的这点奴隶
We only have enough prisoners

46
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,350
只够将我们最强大的勇士传送过去
to send through our strongest warriors.

47
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,140
但这就已经够了  敌人不堪一击
But that will be enough. The enemy is weak.

48
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,590
等我们到了那边  我们就用他们来献祭
When we arrive, we will take them as fuel.

49
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:49,130
我们会建一个新的传送门  当它建成时
We will build a new portal. And when it is complete,

50
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:54,460
我们便可将整个部落都传送过去
we will bring through all... of the Horde.

51
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,860
让我先过去吧
Let me go first.

52
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,650
为了部落
For the Horde!

53
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,450
怀着孩子
With child?

54
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,550
你竟敢把这个累赘  带入我的军团
You dare bring that burden into my warband!

55
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,420
让我过去  黑手  德拉卡
Let me go, Blackhand. Draka!

56
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,420
用力  小丫头  使劲
Push, little one. Push.

57
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,640
我的儿子
My son.

58
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,310
部落迎来了一位新战士
A new warrior for the Horde.

59
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,910
魔  兽

60
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:33,010
铁炉堡

61
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,910
洛萨  过来  我给你看样东西
Lothar, come. I have got something for you.

62
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,350
这是什么  这可是个机械上的奇迹
- What is it? - A mechanical marvel.

63
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,060
这是一把火枪
It's a boomstick.

64
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,680
不妙
Odd.

65
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,480
去喝点水
Take water.

66
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,690
你可能得回家了  大个子
You might want to head home, big man.

67
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,590
似乎有人袭击了你们的一个要塞
Someone has attacked one of your garrisons.

68
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,000
你们的国王现在很需要你  指挥官
It seems your king needs you, commander.

69
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,850
暴风城

70
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:39,340
整个要塞里  居然没有一个人看见
The entire garrison, and no one saw anything.

71
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,090
我们确实找到了一个人
We did find someone.

72
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,490
他当时正在检查尸体  就这儿  就在兵营里
He was searching the bodies, here, in the barracks.

73
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,060
在兵营里
In the barracks?

74
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,140
总算来了  你是负责人
Finally. Are you in command?

75
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,660
咒语

76
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,320
这是肯瑞托族的标志
That's the mark of the Kirin Tor.

77
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,680
你到我的地盘来干嘛  变戏法的
What are you doing in my city, spell chucker?

78
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,220
请让我先检查完对面屋里的那具尸体
Let me complete my examination of the body across the hall.

79
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,250
现在  我为什么要同意呢
Now why would I do that?

80
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,530
在那具尸体里藏着这次袭击的秘密
Within that body is the secret to your attacks.

81
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,960
那是什么东西
What was that?

82
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,280
你必须召唤守护者
You must summon the Guardian.

83
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,740
麦迪文
Medivh?

84
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,940
这件事得由他来解释
It should be he who explains it.

85
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,240
只有国王才可以召唤守护者
Only the king summons the Guardian.

86
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,850
带他去闪金镇
Get him to Goldshire.

87
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,040
兽语

88
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,810
什么样的野兽  那是谣言  国王陛下
- What kind of beasts? - Rumors, your Majesty.

89
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,480
那驻扎的三十个人怎么会悄无声息地就死了
How does a garrison of 30 men disappear without a whisper.

90
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,420
是邪能
The fel.

91
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,870
或者至少是受它影响
Or at least its influence.

92
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,010
就是这个人
Is this him?

93
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:40,880
国王陛下
Your Majesty.

94
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:43,930
父亲
Dad.

95
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,800
辛苦你了  军士
Thank you, sergeant.

96
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,940
敢问法师尊姓大名
So who are you, mage?

97
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,870
我叫卡德加  我是守护者的候选人
My name is Khadgar. I'm a Guardian novitiate.

98
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,420
我曾经是  但我放弃了誓言
I was. I renounced my vows.

99
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,920
所以说你是逃犯
You mean you're a fugitive?

100
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,350
我没有逃跑
I'm not hiding.

101
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,710
国王陛下
Your Majesty.

102
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,630
虽然我离开了法师组织
I may have left my training

103
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,650
但是我法力尚在
but I didn't leave my abilities behind.

104
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,120
我感觉不对劲
I senses something.

105
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,670
当邪恶力量崛起时
Dark forces, when it's strong it...

106
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,250
几乎是可以闻到的
almost has a smell.

107
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,240
察觉到邪恶势力如此逼近
Knowing that something so evil was so close

108
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,760
我不能坐视不管
I couldn't just ignore it.

109
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,910
是哪个地方  是真的吗
Where has this happened? Is this true?

110
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,310
外面怎么回事
What's going on out there?

111
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,680
硝烟  陛下  东南方
Smoke, Sir. The southeast.

112
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,310
国王陛下  我恳请您即刻召唤守护者来保护大家
Your Majesty, I urge you to engage the Guardian with all haste.

113
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,750
他们到艾尔文森林了
They've reached Elwynn Forest.

114
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,260
格兰村着火了
The Grand Hamlet is burning.

115
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,760
被袭击了
An attack?

116
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,680
怎么了  你别再护着卡伦了
- What? - Stop requesting Callan.

117
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,800
我的事不用你管
Stay out of my business.

118
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,920
他一心想要跟随他父亲的脚步
He wants to follow in his father's footsteps.

119
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,570
我的儿子不需要你来管
My son doesn't need your help.

120
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,630
注意语气  你可是在跟王后说话
Tread carefully when you talk to your queen.

121
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,970
别忘了你是我妹妹
You are my sister first.

122
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,280
你上次去卡拉赞是什么时候
When was your last visit to Karazhan?

123
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,310
跟你一起  我记不清了  六年前吧
With you. I don't know... Six years?

124
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,420
自那之后就没再联系上麦迪文了
And you had no contact with Medivh since?

125
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,890
试过很多次了
Not for the lack of trying.

126
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,320
好了
Well.

127
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,020
现在他没法躲我们了
He can't hide from us now.

128
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,820
我来召唤守护者
The Guardian is summoned.

129
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,790
上来吧
Get on.

130
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,560
一路顺利
Good luck.

131
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,000
好的
Okay.

132
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,600
给我活捉他们
We need them alive!

133
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,160
我的孩子
My baby!

134
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,450
这不是战士该做的事
This is not for a warrior.

135
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,900
放开我
Let me go!

136
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,690
霜狼氏族不参加此次狩猎吗
Frostwolves do not join the hunt?

137
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,170
应该手持战斧  而不是拥抱孩子
We prefer our enemies armed with an axe, not a child.

138
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,930
我们这是奉命行事  杜隆坦
We have been commanded, Durotan.

139
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,630
如果一定要遵循传统
Respect the old ways.

140
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,260
我想这破地方肯定有和你实力相当的
There must be a worthy foe somewhere on this dung heap.

141
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,370
找到他们
Find them all!

142
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,680
尽量手下留情  我们要活口
Try not to kill too many, we need them alive.

143
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,710
洛萨
Lothar.

144
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,510
莫罗斯
Moroes.

145
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,930
你看你  你一点都没见老
Look at you. You haven't aged a bit.

146
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,140
其他人呢
Where is everyone?

147
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,070
已经不像从前了
Many things have changed.

148
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,020
全天下的书肯定都在这里了  无尽的知识
The power that must be locked away here, the knowledge.

149
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,990
他在哪儿
Where is he?

150
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,700
我都没想到还有这么多书真实存在
I didn't know so many books even existed.

151
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,360
在这儿等着
Wait here.

152
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,460
尽量不要乱碰任何东西
And try not to touch anything.

153
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,960
他谁都不见吗  因为现在天下太平
- He sees no one? - The world's been at peace.

154
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,730
你能来真好  洛萨
Good you are here, Lothar.

155
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,730
对于守护者  除我这张友善的老脸外
It would do the Guardian a world of good

156
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,400
他还能见到其他朋友  真好
to see a friendly face beyond this old one.

157
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,640
他会见你的  也会见莱恩国王
He can't refuse you... nor King Wrynn.

158
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,030
更何况被召唤了
Not if he's summoned.

159
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,480
快点走吧
Chop chop.

160
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,520
你让他来的  莫罗斯
Did you summon him, Moroes?

161
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,010
不  不是他
No. He did not.

162
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:01,480
所以  你成为一个雕刻家了
So. You become a sculptor?

163
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,770
我在造魔像
I'm making a golem.

164
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,060
一般来说  魔力渗入泥土
It usually takes years of

165
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,850
得耗费多年时间  但在这儿
magic to sip into the clay, but up here it's...

166
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,700
要快得多
much faster.

167
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,240
得给莫罗斯找个伴了
Makes someone to keep Moroes company.

168
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,960
不然光打扫房间就够他忙的
Help to clean up around the house.

169
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,090
谢谢
Thank you.

170
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,980
很高兴你能来  洛萨
It's good to see you, Lothar.

171
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,020
我们需要你的指导  麦迪文
We need your guidance, Medivh.

172
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,360
国王在召唤你
Our king summons you.

173
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,750
楼下那孩子是谁
Who's the boy downstairs?

174
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,320
是谁
Hello?

175
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,460
守护者
Guardian?

176
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,510
你看够了没有
Have a good look around?

177
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,200
想好了日后成了这儿的主人
Getting some ideas what you

178
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,140
会做点什么
are going to do with the place once it's yours?

179
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,160
守护者  我已经放弃了当初的誓言
Guardian, I've renounced my vow.

180
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,360
我不想回到这儿  我发誓  守护者
I didn't want to come here. I swear, Guardian.

181
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,930
我恳请他们来找到你
I urged them to find you. I told them...

182
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,810
因为得由你来解释那些事
you should be the one to explain.

183
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,310
解释什么
Explain what?

184
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,410
邪能
Fel!

185
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,020
在艾泽拉斯
In Azeroth?

186
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,680
在兵营里的尸体中发现的
In the barracks, one of the bodies.

187
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,810
守护者  邪能是什么
Guardian, what is the fel?

188
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:25,160
一种非同寻常的魔法  从生命中汲取力量
A magic unlike any other. It feeds on life itself.

189
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,740
它感染使用者  所及之处无不腐蚀
It pollutes the user, twisting everything it touches.

190
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,810
虽然能够获得强大的能量  但是却要付出沉重代价
It promises great power but it exacts a terrible price.

191
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,180
邪能决不能在艾泽拉斯出现
There is no place for the fel in Azeroth.

192
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,640
你做得很对
You've done the right thing.

193
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,610
我们走
We'll go.

194
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,360
嘿  你自己回家去吧
Hey. Go home, you.

195
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,680
站进来
Step in.

196
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,400
麦迪文  国王陛下
Medivh. Your Grace.

197
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,120
好久不见
It has been too long.

198
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,120
来吧
Come.

199
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,900
帮我们找出问题的根源
Help us get to the roots of these troubles about.

200
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,820
是哪种野兽  他们说个子很大
- What kind of beasts? - They are saying giants.

201
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,390
有武装  他们还骑着巨狼
Armed giants. Wolves to carry them.

202
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,060
无法阻止的巨型怪物
Huge unstoppable monsters.

203
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,450
其他王国情况如何  也受到同样的攻击
What are the other kingdoms? Are they suffering the same?

204
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,560
都来寻求我们的庇护
All seek our protection

205
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,130
却不以诚相待
yet not trust us enough to tell us anything.

206
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,460
我们对这些怪物一无所知
We know nothing about these so call monsters.

207
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,130
我们有俘虏就好了
We need prisoners.

208
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,680
哪怕是具尸体也能提供些线索
Even a corpse can tell us something.

209
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,850
我对此毫无头绪  麦迪文
I don't know what danger we're in, Medivh.

210
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,890
这就是我来此的原因  陛下
I exist to protect this realm, my lord.

211
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,400
这是我唯一的使命
It is my very purpose.

212
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,320
我是守护者
I am the Guardian.

213
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,830
保卫国家是我的使命
At least for the time being anyhow.

214
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,370
是啊
Yes.

215
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,290
那这个人怎么办  叫什么名字来的
What are we going to do about... What is his name?

216
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,320
卡德加  陛下
Khadgar, sire.

217
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,730
他得跟着我们
He'll be coming with us.

218
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,990
好吧
Well then.

219
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:33,110
艾尔文森林
好吧
Well then.

220
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,080
艾尔文森林

221
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,500
我们出发吧
We better get going.
艾尔文森林

222
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:35,710
我们出发吧
We better get going.

223
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,990
停
Halt!

224
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,280
这不可能啊
It can't be.

225
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:44,170
这是什么  从样子上无法判断出来
- What is this? - Can't tell from the look of it.

226
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,220
守护者
Guardian.

227
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,210
收拢队伍
Close ranks!

228

胜利或者失败
Victory or death!

232
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,760
注意你的侧翼  左边
Watch the flank to your left!

你去死吧  你这野兽
Now you die, you beast!

242
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,590
光用蛮力可别想打倒他们
Don't try and take them on with brute force.

243
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,270
只能智取  不能强攻
They are stronger. Be smarter.

只是变绿的那些
Only the green ones!

守护者  守护者  你做了什么
Guardian. Guardian, what did you do?

252
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,980
我说对了  它来了
I was right, wasn't I? It's here.

253
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,070
你要去哪儿
Where are you going?

254
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,480
把他们安全送回暴风城
Get these men safely back to Stormwind.

255
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,760
我必须返回卡拉赞

刚才你表现不错
You did well today.

257
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,660
守护者去哪了  卡拉赞
- Where's the Guardian? - Karazhan.

258
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,790
我们得抓个俘虏  你的马呢
We need a prisoner. Where's your horse?

259
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,920
被他们抢走了  不会吧
They took my horse. Really?

260
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,100
待在这儿别动
Just stay there.

261
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,780
不
No!

262
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,750
你有多爱你的主人
How much do you love your master?

263
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,460
我真动手了
I'll do it.

264
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,880
滚开
Back off!

265
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:40,280
可惜了  本来是块做大衣的好材料
Pity. It would have make a good coat.

266
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,230

在这里
Over here!

269
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,920
你一个人制服它的  是的
You took it alone. Yes.

270
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,170
看上去是个头最小的
Looks like the runt to the litter.

271
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,760
你  是什么东西
You. What are you?

272
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,270
为什么要袭击我们的家园
And why do you attack our lands?

他听不懂你再说什么
He does not know what you speak.

274

你懂我们的语言
You speak our language?

275
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,050
再敢用他们语言说一个字（兽人语）

276
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:43,590
我就割掉你的舌头（兽人语）
And I will wear your tongue.

277
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,270
我不会再警告你了
I will not warn you again.

278
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,930
让他停下来  你跟他说
- Tell him to stop. - You tell him.

279
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,620
举手之劳
You're welcome.

280

你有名字吗
Have you a name?

281
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,270
你能听懂我们的语言
You understand our language.

282
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,880
再问一次  你有名字吗
Again, have you a name?

283
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:36,220
迦罗娜
Garona.

284
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,650
她说她叫迦罗娜
She calls herself, Garona.

285
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,340
你是哪个种族的
What kind of being are you?

286
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:46,710
和我们交战的野兽相比  她倒是和我们更像
She seems more like us than those... beast we fought.

287
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,980
兽族
Orc.

288
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,440
兽族
Orc?

289
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,840
是指你  还是指笼子里的那头野兽
That's what you are? Or the beast in the cage was?

290
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,650
我了解七国中所有种族
I know every races in the Seven Kingdoms.

291
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,700
但未听说过兽族
I've never heard of orc.

292
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,130
告诉我你从哪来的
Show me where you come from.

293
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,250
禁忌之海

294
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,690
荆棘谷  激流堡  暴风城  卡兹莫丹  斯托姆加德  奎尔萨拉斯

295
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,860
这不是兽人的世界
This is not orc world.
荆棘谷  激流堡  暴风城  卡兹莫丹  斯托姆加德  奎尔萨拉斯

296
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,160
荆棘谷  激流堡  暴风城  卡兹莫丹  斯托姆加德  奎尔萨拉斯

297
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,980
我们兽族世界已经不存在了
Orc world is dead.
荆棘谷  激流堡  暴风城  卡兹莫丹  斯托姆加德  奎尔萨拉斯

298
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,170
我们兽族世界已经不存在了
Orc world is dead.

299
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,730
但兽族会占领这个世界
Orcs take this world now.

300
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,970
不是这个世界的
Not from this world.

301
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:20,480
那你是怎么到这儿来的
How did you get here?

302
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,360
黑暗之门
The great gate.

303
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:26,290
在地层深处  通过魔法把我们带到这儿来
Deep in ground and through magic brought us here.

304
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,790
那你怎么会说我们的语言
But how did you learn our language?

305
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,580
献祭传送门的俘虏
Orc take prisoner for the gate.

306
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,610
我跟他们学的  俘虏
I learn from them. Prisoners?

307
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,090
你是说人类  都还活着吗
Our people? Are they alive?

308
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,380
是的
Yes.

309
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,250
很多  为什么
- Many. - Why?

310
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,150
传送门需要
To feed the gate.

311
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:44,410
然后整个部落都过来占领你们的世界
To bring the Horde to take your world.

312
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,210
带我们找到他们
You'll take us to them.

313
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,150
不
No.

314
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,960
带我们找到他们
You'll take us to them,

315
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,180
否则笼子里那位朋友就是你的下场
or you will end up like your friend in the cage.

316
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,460
你以为自己很厉害吗
You think you are fearsome.

317
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,850
我们兽族小孩养的宠物都比你厉害
Orc children have pets more fearsome than you.

318
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:05,450
我们并不想恐吓你  迦罗娜
We're not trying to be fearsome, Garona.

319
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:08,910
我门只是想保护我们的子民和家庭
We are trying to protect our people, our families.

320
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:12,360
如果你可以帮助我们  我向你承诺
If you help us. I give you my oath.

321
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,530
你将获得自由
You will have your freedom.

322
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,770
令人闻风丧胆的黑手
Fearsome Blackhand.

323
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:25,230
堂堂的部落大酋长
Warchief of the Horde.

324
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:31,020
你手下的勇士居然被弱小的人类给杀害了
You have allowed the smallteeths to kill your warriors.

325
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,520
更差劲的
Worse.

326
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,660
让人蒙羞的是自己居然临阵脱逃
You shamed your people by running from an enemy.

327
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:41,500
你是虚弱到不能说话了吗  毁灭者
Are you too weak to talk, destroyer?

328
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,020
弱者在我们的部落里毫无用处
The Horde has no use for weakness.

329
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,420
按照我们的传统  大酋长
Respect our tradition, warchief.

330
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:54,120
你懂这规矩
You know the penalty.

331
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,580
杀无赦
Death.

332
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,010
为了部落
For the horde!

333
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,800
为了部落
For the horde!

334
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,220
为了部落
For the horde!

335
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520
为了部落
For the horde!

336
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,350
够了
Stop!

337
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:21,670
你胆敢打断这场审判
You dare interrupt this judgment?

338
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,420
我们尽力了
We fought hard!

339
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:27,770
他们的术士  用您的邪能对付我们
Their warlock use your fel against us.

340
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:30,690
只有我才能够控制邪能
Only I can control the fel!

341
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:38,170
我发现你的族人都活下来了
I see you and your men have survived.

342
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:43,190
难道是黑手  让你们远离战场  苟且偷生
Perhaps Blackhand kept you safely away from the battlefield.

343
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,870
或许他知道你们和他一样软弱
Maybe he knows you are weak too.

344
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:52,720
你想要跟我单挑吗  小酋长
Do you wish to challenge me, little chieftain.

345
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:59,360
我并无此意  古尔丹
I do not question, Gul'dan.

346
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:04,200
但邪能与死亡相伴  势必付出代价
But the fel is born of death, must have a price.

347
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,910
代价就是夺走一切生命
A price paid in lives taken.

348
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:23,310
你想抱抱儿子吗
Will you hold your son?

349
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,400
他会是个伟大的酋长
He will be a great chieftain.

350
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:45,220
就像他父亲一样  天生的领袖
Like his father, a born leader.

351
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,770
可是我今天让大家失望了
I was no leader today.

352
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,090
他已经在向你挑战了
He challenges you already.

353
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,920
如果连这样的小生命都无法幸免
If Gul'dan can infect born as innocent as he,

354
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,790
更何况我们其他人呢
what chance do the rest of us have?

355
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,610
听天由命吧
Whatever happens.

356
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,820
只能这样了
Whatever happens.

357
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,770
我看见你了
I see you.

358
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:34,050
那扇门的事是谁告诉古尔丹的
This gate, who showed it to Gul'dan?

359
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,740
谁把他带到艾泽拉斯的
Who lead him to Azeroth?

360
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,330
古尔丹称他为恶魔
Gul'dan call him a demon.

361
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,080
你见过他吗
Did you see it?

362
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:44,890
没见过脸  听过声音
Not the face, but the voice...

363
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,550
如同火焰和灰烬
Like fire and ash.

364
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,750
有需要的话就叫我
I'll be here if you need me.

365
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,510
你的伴侣
Your mate.

366
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,300
在你爱人过来之前就把你杀了
I could kill you before he even reaches me.

367
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,550
洛萨
Lothar?

368
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,580
他是我哥哥
He is my brother.

369
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:36,530
国王才是我丈夫
The king is my mate.

370
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,690
这么说你是酋长的老婆
You are the chieftain's wife then?

371
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,680
我想是这样的
I suppose so.

372
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,790
那么杀了你会给我带来更多的荣耀
Then killing you will bring me even greater honor.

373
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,690
我们人类可不这么想
Not among my kind.

374
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,800
今晚很冷
It is a cold night.

375
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,310
我想你可能需要这些
I thought you might use these.

376
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,480
这个会让你暖和些
It will warm you.

377
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,840
今晚  战火又蔓延到了更多地方
More of our villages burned tonight.

378
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:21,320
其中就有我出生的那个村庄
One of them is the village of my birth.

379
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:27,550
我无法想象你曾过着怎样可怕的生活  迦罗娜
I can not imagine what horrors you have been through, Garona.

380
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,900
但是你们完全没必要这样做
but this does not need to happen.

381
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,310
我们已经在这片国度和平生活了很多年
We have peace in these lands for many years now.

382
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,580
各个种族之间和睦相处
Peace between races from all over the world.

383
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:45,000
这个是
What is this?

384
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,480
我可以帮你把它取下来
I can have it removed.

385
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,620
你应该过着自己应有的生活  迦罗娜
There is a life here for you, Garona.

386
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:00,720
和我们一起  过着自由的生活
With us. A life of freedom.

387
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,590
只要你愿意
If you want it.

388
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,780
黑暗之门
The great gate.

389
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:31,250
光明源于黑暗  黑暗涌现光明
From light comes darkness and from darkness, light.

390
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,190
真是浅显易懂
Well, that's clear.

391
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,650
去问阿洛迪
Ask Alodi.

392
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,530
阿洛迪
Alodi.

393
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,340
又见到树了  真是开心呀
It's good to see trees again.

394
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,820
还有积雪
And the snow.

395
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,160
哪怕只是远远看着
Even from a distance.

396
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,530
还记得那时我们
Remember when we would

397
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:04,680
穿过霜风沙丘去捕杀血牛
track blood ox through the Frostwind dunes?

398
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:08,750
总是有肉吃  生机盎然
There was always meat. Always life.

399
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,960
你不觉得奇怪吗
You don't think it's strange

400
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,060
当古尔丹掌权后  我们便失去了家园
that we lost our home when Gul'dan came to power.

401
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,590
单凭一个兽人是无法毁灭世界的  杜隆坦
One orc could not kill a world, Durotan.

402
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,390
你确定
Are you sure?

403
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:23,080
看看这周围  有没有回想起什么
Look around you. Does it not remind you of something?

404
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:29,210
古尔丹在哪施魔法  哪里就枯竭
Wherever Gul'dan works his magic, the land dies.

405
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:34,380
如果我们氏族想在这儿安家  我的朋友
If our people are to make a home here, my friend.

406
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,900
我们就必须阻止古尔丹
Gul'dan must be stopped.

407
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:43,600
以你和我的力量还没办法击败  古尔丹
We are not powerful enough to defeat Gul'dan.

408
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,970
是啊
No.

409
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,980
当然
No.

410
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:55,920
但如果有人类的帮助  我们就能行
But with the humans help, we could be.

411
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,730
我要那件武器
I want that weapon.

412
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,330
我会保护你的
You'll have me to protect you.

413
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,630
我不需要别人保护我
I need no one to protect me.

414
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,600
你在看什么
What are you looking at?

415
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,210
书呆子  站第一班岗
Bookworm. Take the first watch.

416
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,000
尊敬的指挥官  我叫卡德加
Respectfully, Commander, my name is Khadgar.

417
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,740
致以最诚挚的歉意  卡德加
My deepest apologies, Khadgar.

418
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,730
我还以为在你擅闯皇家兵营时
You see, I thought we bonded when

419
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:16,800
我没把你关进牢房
I didn't put you in a

420
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,040
我们就已经是好哥们儿了呢
prison cell for breaking into royal barracks.

421
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,840
赶紧站岗去
Now take the watch.

422
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,170
你居然没看书
Well. At least you're not reading.

423
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,660
他想跟我睡觉
He wishes to lie with me.

424
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,640
你说什么呢
I beg your pardon?

425
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:51,360
你会受伤的
You will be injured.

426
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,280
我不想跟你睡  那就好
- I don't want to lie with you. - Good.

427
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,580
你不会是个合格的伴侣
You would not be an effective mate.

428
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:59,100
你笑什么
Why do you laugh?

429
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:02,740
你们人类做那种事居然能活下来
I can't see how you humans survive such a thing.

430
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:06,430
没有肌肉的保护  脆骨头都会折断的
No muscles to protect you. Brittle bones that break.

431
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,520
你看着跟我们差不多
You don't look that different to us.

432
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,930
你怎么活下来的
How did you survive?

433
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,500
断过的骨头更强壮
Broken bones heal stronger.

434
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,410
我的非常强壮
Mine are very strong.

435
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,810
对不起
I'm sorry.

436
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:23,410
用不着
Do not be.

437
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,360
我的名字  迦罗娜
My name, Garona,

438
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,810
它在兽语中的意思是  诅咒
it means "Cursed" in Orc.

439
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,270
我妈妈因生我而被活生生地烧死了
My mother was burned alive for giving birth to me.

440
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,760
但他们让你活下来了
They kept you alive though.

441
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,270
是古尔丹
Gul'dan did.

442
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:00,420
他把妈妈的獠牙给我  好让我记住她
He gave me her tusk to remember her.

443
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:12,320
在我六岁的时候父母把我送到了肯瑞托
My parents gave me to the Kirin Tor when I was 6 years old.

444
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:16,770
那是我最后一次见他们
That's the last time I saw them or...

445
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,870
以及我的兄弟姐妹们
any of my brothers and sisters.

446
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:26,550
能够把孩子送到肯瑞托  是每个家族的荣耀
It brings a family honor to offer a child to the Kirin Tor.

447
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:30,350
让儿子去漂浮城市达拉然
To have their son taken up to the floating city of Dalaran

448
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:33,660
并在最强大的法师手下接受训练
and be trained by the most powerful mages in the land.

449
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,090
可我  还是让他们失望了
Less so, to have them run away.

450
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:46,740
好伤感
Well. That was cheerful.

451
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,410
那就是黑暗之门
The great gate.

452
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,070
他们抓这么多的俘虏干什么
Why do they need so many prisoners?

453
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,540
好比木头生火
Like wood for a fire.

454
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,410
绿色魔法需要生命才能开门
Green magic takes life to open the gate.

455
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,850
他们打算再送来多少兽人
How many more orcs are they planning on bringing?

456
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:08,880
所有的  这只是一支军团
All of them. This is just a warband.

457
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:13,700
当大门打开后  古尔丹会带来整个部落
When the portal is open, Gul'dan will bring the Horde.

458
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,130
你带他俩先回去
Get them back to Stormwind.

459
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,370
我们过去
We ride ahead.

460
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,680
迦罗娜  我们该走了  这不安全
Garona, we should go. It's not safe...

461
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:41,440
杜隆坦
Durotan.

462
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:45,560
在北边有一块高耸入云的黑色岩石
To the north, there is a black rock that touches the sky.

463
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:48,350
我想见他们的领袖
I would meet with their leader.

464
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,080
是和他决斗吗
To challenge him?

465
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:53,760
我看到你带着人类到我们的营地来
I saw you, lead the smallteeths to our encampment.

466
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:56,010
他们看到了我们还在建造的东西
They have seen what is being built.

467
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:00,920
但只有你清楚  古尔丹对我的族人有什么计划
But only you know, what Gul'dan has planned for my people.

468
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:05,350
这魔法会杀死所有生命
His magic is death to all things.

469
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,030
他必须阻止这魔法
He must be stopped.

470
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:15,900
告诉他  黑色岩石那儿  太阳最高时
Tell him, the black rock, when the sun is highest.

471
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:17,300
我会的
I will.

472
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,510
酋长
Chieftain.

473
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:25,490
如果我回来  你能召我进你的氏族吗
If I return, would you take me into your clan?

474
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,350
你跟着他们  更安全
You're safer here, with them.

475
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:25,140
正如你所担心的
Is it as you feared?

476
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:29,850
到处都是邪能  那你就更不能再离开了
The fel is everywhere. Then you mustn't leave again.

477
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:34,770
现在正是需要守护者的时候
They need the Guardian's help now more than ever.

478
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,160
也许那男孩能帮忙
Maybe the boy can help.

479
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,660
这事儿必须得解决  你说的倒是轻松
We need solution! Easy for you to say that!

480
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:49,240
必须让矮人族工匠锻造更多兵器
The dwarven forges must work overtime.

481
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,840
你把我们看的连条狗都不如
You treat us no better than dogs.

482
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,810
我们这活根本没法干了  够了
We shall supply you no more! Enough!

483
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,730
你们都曾向暴风城请求帮助
You have all called on Stormwind in the past.

484
00:46:57,850 --> 00:46:59,600
无论兵力还是仲裁
Either for troops or arbitration.

485
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:02,600
如果我们不团结一致
If we do not unite

486
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,360
抗击敌人
to fight this enemy,

487
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,490
后果将不堪设想
we will perish.

488
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:07,620
同意  同意
Hear, hear.

489
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:11,080
暴风城需要士兵  武器  马匹
Stormwind needs soldiers, arms, horses...

490
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,450
我们自己的王国也需要这些
We have our own kingdoms to look after.

491
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:15,470
你们自己跟自己打去吧  国王陛下
- Fight your own wars! - Your Majesty.

492
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:17,690
司令官
Commander.

493
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:19,380
兽人在建传送门
The orcs are building a portal,

494
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,340
他们准备送一支军队过来
through which they plan to bring an army.

495
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:25,270
如果现在不阻止他们  我们可能就再也没有机会了
If we do not stop them now, we may never get another opportunity.

496
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:29,670
他在哪里  艾泽拉斯的保护者在哪里
Where is he? Where is the protector of Azeroth?

497
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:31,040
守护者在哪儿
Where the Guardian?

498
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,510
麦迪文去哪了
Where is Medivh?

499
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:35,140
大人  现在暂时休息一下
- My liege. - I suggest we take a recess.

500
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:38,490
你想休息多久就多久  恕不奉陪
Take as long as you like. We're done.

501
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:43,850
司令官
Commander.

502
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:47,170
第四军团的幸存人员已经从石堡要塞撤退了
What's left of the 4th has retreated from Stonewatch.

503
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:48,420
都有谁
What's left?

504
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:51,030
卡伦在受伤名单中
Callan is among the injured.

505
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,110
父亲
Dad?

506
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,840
我很好  没事儿
I'm fine. It's fine.

507
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,570
我很担心你
You had me worried.

508
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,480
你们军团其他人呢
Where's the rest of your troop?

509
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,680
大部分都被活捉了
They took most of them alive.

510
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:22,150
我们会救回来的
We'll get them back.

511
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,340
不要这么冲动
Don't be in such a hurry.

512
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,570
你是我的全部
You're all I have.

513
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,020
我明白  可我是名士兵
I know. I'm a soldier.

514
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:49,140
如果他认为自己能独自战胜古尔丹
He would not ask for this meeting

515
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,750
那就不会请求会面
if he thought he could defeat Gul'dan alone.

516
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:55,810
邪能肯定把他吓坏了
The fel must truly terrified him.

517
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,400
杜隆坦什么都不怕
Durotan is scared of nothing.

518
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,430
在那个地点
The location.

519
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,740
突然要求见面
The suddenness of this meeting.

520
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,520
听上去像陷阱  不是的
- Sounds like a trap. - It is not.

521
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,030
有可能  不是的
- Could be. - It is not.

522
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,730
有可能  不是的
- Could be. - It is not.

523
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,160
你有什么想法
What do you think?

524
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,150
但这确实是不容错过的好机会
It's too good an opportunity to ignore.

525
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:15,930
我们别无选择
I think we have no choice.

526
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:19,980
必须阻止兽人打开传送门
We must stop the orcs from opening the portal.

527
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:22,800
但是我们需要援助
But we will need help.

528
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:25,630
要是他说谎呢  兽人不会说谎
- And if he's lying? - Orcs do not lie.

529
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,960
如果他会呢  这样做没有任何意义
- What if he is? - There is no honor in it.

530
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,850
那他背叛自己族人的意义又在哪儿呢
And where's the 'honor' in him betraying his own people?

531
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:34,910
杜隆坦要保护他的氏族  他的敌人是邪能
Durotan is protecting his clan. His enemy is the fel.

532
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,980
古尔丹才是背叛者
Gul'dan is the betrayer.

533
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,140
这个兽人  杜隆坦  你怎么认识他的
This orc, Durotan. How do you know him?

534
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:44,350
他释放了我  而且他深受族人爱戴
He freed me, and he is loved by his clan.

535
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,000
他是一个伟大的酋长
He's a strong chieftain.

536
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,130
伟大的领袖必须赢得族人们的信任
Strong chiefs must earn their clans trust.

537
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:53,550
如果我们想让你加入
If we are to expect you to join us.

538
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,780
我们就得赢取你的信任
We must earn yours.

539
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:07,200
为了保护你的安全
To defend yourself.

540
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:10,150
用这玩意儿
With this?

541
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,320
是的
Yes.

542
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,010
去找守护者
Find the Guardian.

543
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:19,270
这是什么
What is this?

544
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:21,650
守护者
Guardian?

545
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,550
传送门  我们看到了  在黑暗沼泽
The gate. We saw it, in the morass.

546
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:31,170
我把能收集的线索都整理在一起
I've been putting together all the clues I can about it.

547
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,920
这个  这幅画
This. This drawing.

548
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:36,550
你从哪儿描的  守护者
- Where did you copy it from? - Guardian.

549
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:37,950
还有这个
And this?

550
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:43,800
这个  和这个
And this? And this?

551
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,690
自从感应到邪能出现  我就开始调查了
I've been researching ever since I felt the presence of the fel.

552
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:50,600
我才是守护者  我  不是你
I am the Guardian. Me, not you.

553
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:52,520
还早呢
Not yet.

554
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:55,120
我只是认为您可能需要一些帮助
I just thought you might appreciate some help.

555
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,130
不要以为你能帮到我
Don't presume you can help me.

556
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:12,620
你根本不了解我所对抗的那种力量
You have no idea the forces I contend with.

557
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:18,890
如果你真想帮忙  那就保护好国王
If you want to help, protect the king.

558
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,820
邪能的事情交给我
You leave the fel to me.

559
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:36,340
真是有趣的选择  守护者
- Interesting choice. - Guardian.

560
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:42,590
收拾好东西然后前往西门
Pack up and move to the west gate.

561
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:48,770
你在那里
You there.

562
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:51,040
离开你的摊位  快给我动起来
Pack up your stall and get moving now!

563
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:58,970
你得帮帮我
I need your help.

564
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:01,260
我找到一本书  那又怎么样
- I found a book. - Of course you did.

565
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,980
里面有一幅门的插图
There was an illustration that showed the gate

566
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,740
跟我们看见的正在建的那扇很像
like the one we saw being built.

567
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,580
对不起  对不起  卡德加
- Sorry. Sorry. - Khadgar.

568
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:12,150
听着  然后我给守护者看  但他大发雷霆
Listen. I tried to show the Guardian but he became furious.

569
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:13,950
他烧光了我所有的调查
He burned all my research.

570
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:16,780
幸好我袍子里还藏了一张  不然也要被烧了
He would have burn this too If I hadn't hidden it in my robe.

571
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:25,830
不对  竖过来  这样
No, turn the page. Here.

看

你怎么理解这幅画
What do you think the image means?

575
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,960
兽人是被召唤来的
The orcs were summoned.

576
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:38,900
是我们这边有人邀请他们过来的
From this side of the gate. They were invited in.

577
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:46,290
然后守护者烧光了你的调查
And the Guardian burned your research.

578
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:51,330
他也许只是想要保护你
He's probably just trying to protect you.

579
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,630
你可以走了
Now go away.

580
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:14,100
这地方很容易中埋伏
Good spot for an ambush.

581
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,690
我们的人已经到位了
Our sentries are well placed.

582
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,230
我再去看看
I will check again.

583
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,490

He told me to watch you.

712
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:17,210
国王他  他还活着
The king. He is alive.

713
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,090
洛萨的儿子战死了
Lothar's son is dead.

714
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:28,440
是我力争这次会面的
I argued for the meeting.

715
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,290
洛萨会恨死我的
Lothar will hate me.

716
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:34,450
你为此感到难过
This upsets you.

717
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:39,530
他是一个伟大的战士
He is a great warrior.

718
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:43,070
他能保护好他的族人
He defends his people well.

719
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,370
也是个不错的兽人
A good mate for an orc.

720
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:48,110
我不是兽人
I am no orc.

721
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,490
可我也不是人类
I am no human either.

722
01:05:55,970 --> 01:06:00,520
在我年轻时  常常觉得与家人很疏远
When I was younger, I used to feel apart from my kin.

723
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:08,340
我就去各地旅行  一心寻找智慧
I traveled far and wide, looking for... wisdom.

724
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:09,900
守护和平是我的使命
Feel a connection with

725
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:13,490
进而体会到各种生命之间的联系
all the souls I was charged with protecting.

726
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:18,930
在旅行中我遇见一个强大而高贵的种族
In my travel, I met a strong and noble people.

727
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:25,240
在他们之中  有位女性  她接受了最真实的我
Among them, a female, who accepted me for what I was.

728
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:27,170
她爱上我
Who loved me.

729
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:33,530
可那不是命运安排给我的生活
It was not a life I was fated to have,

730
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:35,050
但这教会我一个道理
but it taught me something.

731
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:38,210
如果你想收获爱情
If love is what you need,

732
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:43,270
就得历经磨难  直到遇见你的另一半
you must be willing to travel to the end the world to find it.

733
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:50,920
你离开了你的伴侣
You left your mate.

734
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:52,750
去找洛萨吧
Go find Lothar.

735
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:16,570
站进圈子里来
Step inside the circle.

736
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:31,770
这个  是我给你的礼物  迦罗娜
This... is my gift to you, Garona.

737
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:04,510
一座雕像交换一个世界
A whole world and exchange for a statue.

738
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,950
神真是奇怪的物种
Gods are strange creatures.

739
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:15,610
霜狼氏族  你们是个务实的氏族
Frostwolves, you are a practical people.

740
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:19,860
我们从南方来的  总是很欣赏你们这点
Those of us from the south have always admired that about you.

741
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:31,050
当传送门打开时  其余的部落都将加入我们
When the portal opens, when the rest of the Horde join us

742
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:33,780
我们会把邪能赐予
we will give them the fel.

743
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:37,540
所有人  杜隆坦不同意这样做
- All of them. - Durotan did not agree to this!

744
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:40,620
你为什么要在乎那个叛徒的想法
And why would you care what that traitor thinks?

745
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:44,810
是时候给霜狼氏族找个新领袖了
It is time for a new leader of the Frostwolf clan.

746
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:48,160
这位领袖会以氏族利益为重
One who has the best interest of his orcs in mind,

747
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,710
欣赏我古尔丹的眼光
One who appreciates Gul'dan's vision,

748
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,490
我的权力
his power.

749
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:58,870
过来
Come.

750
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:02,130
让我赐予你邪能
I will grant you the fel.

751
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:09,150
杜隆坦他  让霜狼氏族觉得邪能是有害的东西
Durotan, he... has poisoned the Frostwolves against the fel.

752
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:13,420
让我先去召集大家  都到这儿来
Let me gather them, bring them here.

753
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:17,580
当众赐予我邪能  好让他们亲眼看看
Grant me the fel in front of them, let them see...

754
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:19,970
邪能让我变得多么强大
How much stronger I become.

755
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:25,510
正如我所说  一个务实的氏族
As I said, a practical people.

756
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:28,930
这是一个新时代
This is a new dawn.

757
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,760
是属于部落的时代
The time of the Horde.

758
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:36,980
臣服于我  或献祭于门
Be feared, or be fuel.

759
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:51,680
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

760
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:55,520
卡伦的母亲
Callan's mother,

761
01:09:57,970 --> 01:10:00,010
在生他的时候死了
died in childbirth.

762
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,170
为此我责怪了卡伦很多年
I blamed him for it, for years.

763
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:10,050
我不会怪你的
I'm not going to blame you.

764
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,790
他还那么年轻
He was so young.

765
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:35,610
在我的一生中
In my entire life,

766
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:42,660
我从来没有像现在这么痛苦过
I have never felt so much pain as I do now.

767
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:50,200
不
No...

768
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,660
不
No!

769
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:57,700
出发  快走
Move out. Go!

770
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,920
快走
Move!

771
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:02,560
古尔丹可不想在霜狼氏族身上浪费能量
Gul'dan does not want to waste his power on the Frostwolves.

772
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,920
烧死他们
Burn them!

773
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:12,300
强的杀掉  弱的抓走
Take the weak, kill the strong!

774
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:31,200
我势必亲手杀了你
I'll bathe in your blood.

775
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:33,790
也许吧  但不是现在
Maybe, but not now.

776
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:38,050
我没法帮你拖延太久  但足够你逃走了
I can't give you long, but I can give you a head start.

777
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:42,560
为了你的儿子着想  德拉卡
For the sake of your son, Draka.

778
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:45,730
快跑  马上
Leave... now.

779
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,550
把他们全都赶尽杀绝
Kill them all!

780
01:11:56,890 --> 01:11:58,800
烧掉他们的营帐
Burn it down!

781
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:04,860
你本应该信任你的酋长的  奥格瑞姆·毁灭之锤
You should have trusted in your chieftain, Orgrim Doomhammer.

782
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:17,240
她要逃走了
She's getting away!

783
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:44,400
等着我
Wait for me.

784
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:48,220
卡德加  你居然还敢回到这里
- Khadgar! - How dare you to come here!

785
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:49,110
出去
Get out!

786
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:50,700
我是来寻求您帮助的
I come seeking your wisdom.

787
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:52,830
这里不再为你提供任何帮助
There is nothing for you here now.

788
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:54,820
守护者麦迪文出事了
The Guardian, Medivh, is unwell.

789
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:55,870
什么
What?

790
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:58,250
他已经被邪能感染了  怎么会
- He's been poisoned by the fel. - What?

791
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:00,040
简直可笑
Ridiculous.

792
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:02,100
您了解黑暗之门吗
What do you know of the dark portal?

793
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:05,070
你回到这里  还污蔑守护者
You come back, and accused the Guardian...

794
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:06,300
阿洛迪是什么
What is Alodi?

795
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:08,310
他怎么知道的
How does he know?

796
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:16,540
阿洛迪
Alodi.

797
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,600
这是什么
What is it?

798
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:22,820
它在肯瑞托族诞生之前就已经存在了
An entity from a time before the Kirin Tor existed.

799
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:26,610
我们认为它和守护者的职责类似
We think it serve the functions similar to that of the Guardian.

800
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,390
保护者
Protector.

801
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:30,700
只有肯瑞托六人议会知晓它的存在
No one beyond the Arch Council knows of it's existence,

802
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:34,120
一直都是如此
and it will stay that way.

803
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:36,980
因为你同时提到了它和黑暗之门
And you to mention it in the same breath

804
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:39,760
这就不太可能是
as the dark portal is too much to be mere...

805
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:44,390
巧合了
coincidence.

806
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:48,060
要进去吗
Do I go in?

807
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,910
我不知道  从未出现这种情况
I don't know. It's never done that before.

808
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:11,280
卡德加
Khadgar.

809
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:14,180
我知道您  在藏书室
I know you, from the library.

810
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:17,700
您是阿洛迪
You're Alodi?

811
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:26,460
我用最后一点能量把你召唤至此
I used the last of my energies to summon you here.

812
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:30,650
守护者已经背叛了我们  麦迪文
The Guardian has betrayed us. Medivh.

813
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:36,010
我在他眼中看见了邪能  他被邪能控制了
I saw the fel in his eyes. He is consumed by it.

814
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:40,580
如果不阻止他  这个世界就会灭亡
If he is not stopped, this world will burn.

815
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,440
我不可能战胜一个守护者
I don't have the power to defeat a Guardian.

816
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,310
守护者只是一个称谓罢了
Guardian is but a name.

817
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:51,830
这个世界真正的守护者是人们自己
The true Guardians of this world are the people themselves.

818
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:55,090
我知道你看见了肯瑞托所看不见的东西
I know you see what the Kirin Tor can not.

819
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:57,120
所以你才离开了他们
It's why you left them.

820
01:14:57,390 --> 01:15:04,180
没有人能够独自战胜黑暗势力  没有
No one can stand against the darkness... alone.

821
01:15:05,050 --> 01:15:07,390
我不明白你希望我做什么
I don't understand what you want me to do.

822
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,540
不  你知道
Yes, you do.

823
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:18,100
信任你的朋友们
Trust in your friends.

824
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:22,190
齐心协力  你们能拯救这世界
Together, you can save this world.

825
01:15:22,570 --> 01:15:24,880
请永远记住
Always remember.

826
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:27,810
光明源于黑暗
From light comes darkness,

827
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:32,350
黑暗中涌现光明
and from darkness... light.

828
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:44,290
快起来吧
Up, up.

829
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:54,080
谢谢你  莫罗斯
Thank you, Moroes.

830
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:56,970
你会恢复的  守护者
You'll recover, Guardian.

831
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:58,180
你可以的
You always do.

832
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,160
不  谢谢
No...Thank you,

833
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,040
感谢你所做的一切
for everything you've done.

834
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:24,150
对不起  老朋友
I'm sorry, old friend.

835
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:30,590
看来似乎是我让兽人来到这个世界的
It seems I have let the orcs into this world.

836
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:34,930
邪能它已经腐化我了  我
The fel has twisted me. I...

837
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:37,910
我甚至不知道我还干了些什么
don't even know what else I may have done.

838
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:42,480
我就是什么都不记得了
I just don't remember.

839
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:53,150
那些我本想保护的却被我摧毁了
Everything I fought to protect, I have... destroyed.

840
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:56,440
我无法控制邪能
I can't control the fel.

841
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,680
没有人可以
No one can.

842
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:16,110
五个军团堵住逆风小径
Five legions to block Deadwind Pass.

843
01:17:16,410 --> 01:17:18,940
另外十个在这儿  这儿和这儿
Another ten here, here, and here,

844
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:20,710
沿着赤脊山脉
along Redridge Mountains.

845
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,510
供给部队在这儿
Supply lines here.

846
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:25,340
紧忌之海则从南面和东面将他们包围
While the Eastern Sea hems them in both south and east.

847
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:30,510
如果我们能守住这些位置  我们就很有优势了
If we hold these positions, we will be at our strongest.

848
01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:32,750
围堵他们
Containment?

849
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,440
除非有更好的方案  是的
Until there is a better option, yes.

850
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,530
当他们大举入侵之时
And where there is 10 times as many.

851
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:38,220
该怎么办
What then?

852
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:41,440
哪能这么容易就有方案
If there were easy answers...

853
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:44,320
我们的当务之急就是阻止传送门被打开
Our priority must be to stop the gate from opening.

854
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:47,390
如果围堵失败  这只是一个时间问题
Fail there, and it's just a matter of time

855
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:48,850
我们就会成为待宰的羔羊
before they beat us with sheer numbers.

856
01:17:48,850 --> 01:17:50,430
你有什么好建议
What do you suggest?

857
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,330
出动我们全部兵力
Send everything we got.

858
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,180
摧毁那扇门  救出俘虏  这是当务之急
Destroy the gate, free our people, and end the immediate threat.

859
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:00,850
剩下的那些兽人呢  之后我们再收拾他们
And the orcs that remain? We'll take care of them later.

860
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:02,940
那时整个王国都被他们摧毁了
After they've ravaged the entire kingdom?

861
01:18:03,810 --> 01:18:06,440
陛下  麦迪文  你没事了
My Lords. Medivh. You are up and well.

862
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:11,380
是的  我感到  精力充沛
I am. I feel... restored.

863
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:14,470
我们需要你  我们正因采用哪种战术而苦恼
We need you. We've been agonizing over our options.

864
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:16,520
有些人认为没有可行战术
Some of us believe there are no options.

865
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,770
我们需要新观点  我告诉你们
We need fresh eyes.I have news.

866
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:22,420
我见过杜隆坦了  你见过杜隆坦了
I've met with Durotan.You met with Durotan.

867
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:26,100
对抗古尔丹的反叛力量正逐渐壮大
The rebellion against Gul'dan is gaining strength.

868
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:28,830
在他们的帮助下我们可以摧毁传送门
With their help we can destroy this gate.

869
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:31,150
那也不会改变我的计划  什么计划
That doesn't change my plan.What plan?

870
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,200
安度因认为我们应该出动所有兵力
Anduin believes we should attack with full force.

871
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:37,190
但我担心这会造成后方没有防守
I'm concerned it leaves the rest of the kingdom defenseless.

872
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:40,820
你需要多少个军团的兵力  来包围兽人的战士们
How many legions would you need to hold the orcs in place?

873
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:44,430
逆风小径五个  赤脊山派出十个
Five for Deadwind Pass. Ten for the Redridge Mountains.

874
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:45,710
城市守卫留十个以上
Ten more to protect the city.

875
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:48,100
我们已经失去了十八个军团
We've already lost 18 legions.

876
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:51,830
就只剩下一  二  三  这样行吗  麦迪文
That leaves one, two, three.Can it be done, Medivh?

877
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:53,850
不  这绝对不行
No, it can't be done.

878
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:57,580
三个军团  霜狼氏族和我的力量
With three legion, Frostwolves, and my power...

879
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:59,490
恕我直言  守护者
With all due respect, Guardian, your powers

880
01:18:59,490 --> 01:19:02,130
事实证明你的力量最近似乎很不可靠
have proven unreliable at best recently.

881
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,190
莱恩  我让你失望过吗
Llane. Have I ever let you down?

882
01:19:04,190 --> 01:19:05,020
让他失望
Let him down?

883
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:07,220
在过去的六年间你到底去哪里了
Where have you even been for the last 6 years?

884
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:10,630
好了  安度因  麦迪文是守护者
Please, Anduin. Medivh is the Guardian...

885
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:12,330
却不再是你记忆中的他
Not the one you remember.

886
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:15,760
他迷失了  他不稳定
He's lost. He's unstable.

887
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,080
当你真需要他时  他就会失踪
And he won't be there when you really need him.

888
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:20,320
控制下你的情绪  安度因
Find your bearings, Anduin.

889
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,140
我愿意为你赴汤蹈火
I'd march into hell for you,

890
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:25,060
哪怕我只能看到一点点胜利的希望
if I thought there was a slightest chance of victory.

891
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,320
但这没有  简直是去送死
But there isn't, this is suicide.

892
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:28,950
是因为卡伦吗
Is this about Callan?

893
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:31,810
这是一场悲剧
It was a tragedy.

894
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,960
要不是因为他过于努力地想得到你的认可
If he hadn't been trying so hard to win your approval,

895
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,290
也许今天他还在我们身边  麦迪文
- he might still be with us. - Medivh.

896
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:39,670
卡伦还没准备好  你知道的
Callan wasn't ready. You knew it.

897
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:41,170
尽管如此  你还是让他上了战场
And you let him play soldier anyway.

898
01:19:41,170 --> 01:19:42,330
安度因  停下  不要
Anduin, stop! No!

899
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:43,520
是你杀了他
You killed him!

900
01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:44,770
你给我闭嘴
Just save it!

901
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,690
司令官  给我闭嘴  长官  别这样
Commander. Please, sir. Please.

902
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,590
瓦里斯  把他关进牢房冷静下
Varis. Take him to a cell to calm down.

903
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:54,020
你这样是帮不了任何人的
You are no use to us like this.

904
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,490
我们会保护好王国  陛下
We'll protect the kingdom, my lord.

905
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:10,410
你和我
You and I.

906
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:24,940
你来这里干嘛
Why are you here?

907
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,590
国王
The king.

908
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,660
他亲自出去攻打部落了
He goes to fight the Horde.

909
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:35,450
在你们守护者的帮助下  杜隆坦会杀了古尔丹
With your Guardian's help, Durotan will kill Gul'dan.

910
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:36,710
不要相信他
Don't trust him.

911
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:38,610
我跟你说过  兽人不会说谎
I've told you, orcs do not lie.

912
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:39,940
不是杜隆坦
Not Durotan.

913
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,230
别相信麦迪文
Don't trust Medivh.

914
01:20:50,170 --> 01:20:51,880
我会尽力保护你们的国王
I will try to protect your king.

915
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:54,420
不要跟他们去
Don't go with them.

916
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:55,800
为什么
Why?

917
01:20:58,930 --> 01:21:00,470
我不想让你受伤
I don't want you to get hurt.

918
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:16,140
一定要活着回来
Come back alive.

919
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:26,630
放了我们  我们好渴
- Free us. - We're thirsty!

920
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,390
放了我们吧  放了我们吧
Spare us! Spare us!

921
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:38,770
拜托  请帮帮我们
Please! We need your help!

922
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:40,750
嘿  霜狼氏族的
Hey, Frostwolf.

923
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:42,200
是谁
Who goes...

924
01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:46,560
如今你成了所有人的敌人
Now you are enemies with all sides.

925
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,230
我会说是你干的
I'll tell them it was you.

926
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:03,920
发生什么了
What happened?

927
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,340
我很抱歉  杜隆坦
I'm sorry, Durotan.

928
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:12,670
之前我以为我们无法与人类结盟
I did not see how we could side with the humans...

929
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:14,590
对抗我们自己人
against our own kind.

930
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,240
我错了
I was wrong.

931
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,890
古尔丹的邪能正在摧毁我们
Gul'dan's fel magic is destroying us.

932
01:22:30,030 --> 01:22:32,040
德拉卡呢  很安全
- Where's Draka? - Safe.

933
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,090
但是其他人
But, the rest...

934
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:37,880
他们不会追随他的
They won't follow him,

935
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:40,480
如果他们看清了古尔丹的真面目
if they could see what he has become.

936
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:44,620
我让大家看清楚
And I will show them.

937
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:12,620
一家人的安全只有交给你
There is no other man

938
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:15,400
我才能够放心  瓦里安
I would entrust the safety of my family to, Varian.

939
01:23:16,370 --> 01:23:18,770
我不在的时候  保护好他们
Keep them safe while I'm gone.

940
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:33,720
准备好了吗
Ready?

941
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:37,240
如果洛萨能与我们一同出征就好了
I would feel better if Lothar were riding with us.

942
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:39,130
我们不会有事的
We'll be fine.

943
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:41,950
我要回卡拉赞做战前准备
I'll return to Karazhan and get ready for battle.

944
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:44,970
在传送门那见
Find me at the portal.

945
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,420
守卫
Guard.

946
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:11,060
我知道你只是奉命行事
I know you're just doing your job,

947
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:12,800
并且你已经很出色了
and a good one at that.

948
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:16,250
但我已经冷静下来了
But I've cool down now.

949
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:19,300
所以你过来把牢门打开
So, if you just come and open this gate.

950
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:21,470
我就能去保护国王了
So I can protect the king.

951
01:24:24,330 --> 01:24:25,640
把门打开
Open the gate!

952
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:27,450
我只是听命于我的
I am just following my...

953
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:36,990
你到底跑哪儿去了  肯瑞托
- Where the hell have you been? - The Kirin Tor.

954
01:24:38,270 --> 01:24:40,810
这法术只对头脑简单的人有效  持续大概一分钟
It only works on the simple minded, last about a minute.

955
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:43,170
你的盔甲  司令官
Your armor, commander.

956
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:45,460
对不住了
Sorry.

957
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:51,660
他们一天前就走了
They have a full day ahead of us.

958
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:53,920
我只希望我们还能赶得上
I just hope we're not too late.

959
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,130
我们不去追他们
We can't go after them.

960
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:56,440
如果你想拯救艾泽拉斯
Not if you want to save Azeroth.

961
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:58,830
我的国王需要我  艾泽拉斯更需要你
- My king needs me. - AZEROTH needs you more!

962
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,200
如果你想救你的国王
If you want to save your king,

963
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,100
我们必须先阻止麦迪文
we need to stop Medivh first.

964
01:25:06,630 --> 01:25:08,380
咒语

965
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:09,760
咒语

966
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:14,650
麦迪文在哪儿
Where is Medivh?

967
01:25:16,130 --> 01:25:17,660
我们得杀了那恶魔
We got a demon to kill.

968
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,990
她不会跑太远  去搜那里
Can't be far.Search over there.

969
01:25:26,030 --> 01:25:28,030
我要找到那个孩子
I need that baby.

970
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:32,000
给我到处搜
Check everywhere!

971
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,260
去吧  就在附近搜一下那边
Go. Search over here.

972
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:45,150
记住
Remember.

973
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:47,860
你是杜隆坦和德拉卡的儿子
You are the son of Durotan and Draka,

974
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:50,050
拥有酋长一族的血脉
an unbroken line of chieftains.

975
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,350
到河边去搜
Search by the river.

976
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,850
我是杜隆坦  加拉德之子
I am Durotan, son of Garad.

977
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:46,520
霜狼氏族的酋长
Chieftain of the Frostwolf clan.

978
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:50,270
我来这儿就是要杀了古尔丹
And I am here to kill Gul'dan.

979
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:54,700
鬼魂不配发起玛克戈拉
Ghost cannot invoke Mak'gora.

980
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:57,720
你是氏族里都没人了
You are the chieftain of no clan.

981
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:00,580
你的族人全都扔去喂虫了
Your people are food for worms.

982
01:27:01,770 --> 01:27:04,640
我们族人还有人活着呢  大酋长
Some of us still live, warchief.

983
01:27:08,660 --> 01:27:10,550
需要我立刻干掉他们吗
Do I make a quick end of them?

984
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:14,690
我以为你一直很遵循传统呢  黑手
I always thought you were one for tradition, Blackhand.

985
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:18,430
杜隆坦
Durotan.

After all, life is just fuel to you, isn't it?

1089

都过来  我们去大门的后面攻击他们
Go around! We'll attack them behind the portal!

1134
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:28,100
小心后面
Watch your flank!

1135
01:42:29,650 --> 01:42:30,890
照顾好它
Take care of him.

1136
01:42:37,590 --> 01:42:38,780
我们得撤了
We should leave.

1137
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:41,690
我们要尽可能救更多的人
We save as many of our people as we can.

1138
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:50,650
寂寞是最要命的  它使我们变得脆弱
It's the loneliness that makes us weak.

1139
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:53,180
卡德加
Khadgar.

1140
01:42:56,010 --> 01:42:57,390
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1141
01:42:59,170 --> 01:43:01,600
我本想拯救所有人
I wanted to save us all.

1142
01:43:04,830 --> 01:43:06,330
就像曾经的我
I always did.

1143
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:18,760
快走
Move!

1144
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:22,490
不
No!

1145
01:43:22,570 --> 01:43:23,610
传送门关闭了
It's closed!

1146
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:27,280
守护者已经不行了
We've lost the Guardian.

1147
01:43:27,610 --> 01:43:28,730
不  不  不
No, no, no!

1148
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:39,750
掩护侧翼  掩护侧翼
Protect the flank! Protect the flank!

1149
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:14,190
黑手要过来杀掉你  从而获得荣耀
Blackhand comes to claim the honor of killing you.

1150
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:21,030
迦罗娜
Garona.

1151
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:25,010
若我俩都死了没有任何好处
No good will come from us both died.

1152
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:29,520
看看四周吧  我们被包围了
Look around you, we are surrounded.

1153
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:34,720
你杀了我是我们唯一能获得和平的希望
Your killing me is the only hope we have for peace.

1154
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:39,090
你跟塔丽雅夫人说过杀了她能带给你荣誉
You told Lady Taria that killing her would bring you honor.

1155
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:42,350
那么杀了我  你就是个英雄了
Well. Killing me would make you a hero.

1156
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:47,270
活下去
Survive.

1157
01:44:48,430 --> 01:44:51,340
为兽族与人类之间带来和平
Bring peace between orcs and humans.

1158
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:55,560
你必须这样
You must.

1159
01:45:14,370 --> 01:45:15,790
你必须这样
You must.

1160
01:45:41,860 --> 01:45:43,520
不  不
No. No!

1161
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:04,350
是她杀了人类的国王  古尔丹
She has killed their chieftain, Gul'dan.

1162
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,810
部落的怀抱向你敞开
The Horde embraces you.

1163
01:46:10,030 --> 01:46:11,250
兽人
Orc.

1164
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:51,060
玛克戈拉
Mak'gora.

1165
01:49:05,250 --> 01:49:06,770
为我的儿子
For my son.

1166
01:49:15,220 --> 01:49:16,440
杀了他
Kill him.

1167
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:23,230
杀了他
Kill him!

1168
01:49:27,710 --> 01:49:31,210
古尔丹  玛克戈拉  是神圣的
Gul'dan, the Mak'gora is sacred.

1169
01:49:31,790 --> 01:49:34,680
那个人赢了  名正言顺
The human won, fairly.

1170
01:49:35,690 --> 01:49:37,810
战士们应该尊重他们的传统
Let your warriors honor their tradition.

1171
01:49:37,810 --> 01:49:40,570
没有人可以违抗我
I will not be disobeyed.

1172
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:43,690
你们还在等什么
What are you waiting for?

1173
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:51,230
照我说的做
Do as I say!

1174
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:54,630
叛徒
Traitors!

1175
01:49:58,310 --> 01:50:01,370
别挡着我的道  让我自己来
Get out of my way, I'll do it myself.

1176
01:50:01,450 --> 01:50:02,640
谁会服从你
Who will obey you,

1177
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:04,670
如果你与自己的种族为敌
if you go to war with your own kind?

1178
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:08,620
如果你这样做  你会失去整个部落
If you do this, you will lose the Horde.

1179
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:11,030
而这场战争才刚刚开始
And this war is only beginning.

1180
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:52,860
给你儿子吧
For your son.

1181
01:50:57,310 --> 01:50:59,810
愿你的精神永远指引他
So your spirit can teach him.

1182
01:51:31,390 --> 01:51:32,670
迦罗娜的匕首
Garona's dagger.

1183
01:51:34,250 --> 01:51:36,260
我从莱恩脖子上拔下来的
I pulled that from Llane's neck.

1184
01:51:36,670 --> 01:51:38,500
肯定是有原因的
Well. There has to be an explanation.

1185
01:51:38,900 --> 01:51:42,210
是的  她做出了选择
Yes. She made her choice.

1186
01:51:43,620 --> 01:51:45,120
我相信不是这样
I don't believe that.

1187
01:51:48,170 --> 01:51:51,380
或许我们看走眼了  知人知面不知心
Maybe you and I didn't know her as well as we thought we did.

1188
01:51:55,230 --> 01:51:59,590
一个城邦能够拥有的最好恩赐
There is no greater blessing a city can have

1189
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:06,110
就是有位  愿意牺牲自己来保护人民的好国王
than a king who would sacrifice himself for his people.

1190
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:11,760
但必须让他的这种牺牲有意义
But such a sacrifice must be earned.

1191
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:13,980
要让他死得其所
We must deserve it.

1192
01:52:14,630 --> 01:52:19,180
所以我们要组成联盟  以悼念这位伟大的国王
If we only show our unity to mourn a good man's death.

1193
01:52:19,350 --> 01:52:22,090
莱恩国王是否相信错了你们
Was King Llane wrong to believe in you?

1194
01:52:22,090 --> 01:52:24,430
不  不
- No! - No!

1195
01:52:24,870 --> 01:52:27,170
我们会为您报仇  王后
We will avenge you, my lady!

1196
01:52:28,070 --> 01:52:30,960
带领我们抗击兽人吧  洛萨
Lead us against the orcs, Lothar!

1197
01:52:32,190 --> 01:52:34,480
洛萨  洛萨
- Lothar! - Lothar!

1198
01:52:34,610 --> 01:52:36,720
洛萨  洛萨
- Lothar! - Lothar!

1199
01:52:37,290 --> 01:52:39,100
洛萨  洛萨
- Lothar! - Lothar!

1200
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:52,250
为了艾泽拉斯  为了艾泽拉斯和联盟
For Azeroth! For Azeroth and the Alliance!

1201
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:54,310
为了艾泽拉斯  为了联盟
For Azeroth!

1202
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:57,530
为了联盟  为了联盟
For the Alliance!

1203
01:53:02,660 --> 01:53:06,630
魔  兽

1204
01:53:20,850 --> 01:53:23,710
你要走的路还很长  我的小古伊尔
You will travel far, my little Go'el.

1205
01:53:29,130 --> 01:53:33,320
我们的世界已灭亡  但你会在这继续成长
My world maybe lost, but this is your world now.

1206
01:53:33,980 --> 01:53:35,970
在这儿努力学习
Take what you need from it.

1207
01:53:36,270 --> 01:53:40,440
让兽人再次安家  任何人都不能阻止你前行的道路
Make a home for the orcs and let no one stand in your way.

1208
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:45,890
长官  您过来看一下
My lord. You should see this.

1209
01:53:46,670 --> 01:53:49,960
你是杜隆坦  与德拉卡的儿子
You are the son of Durotan and Draka,

1210
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:52,610
拥有一脉相承的酋长血统
an unbroken line of chieftains.

1211
01:53:52,610 --> 01:53:54,830
我族此时正需要一名领袖
And our people need a leader now...

1212
01:53:54,830 --> 01:53:56,170
比以往任何时候
more than ever.
