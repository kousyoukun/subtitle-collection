1
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,341
Time gentlemen. Drink up.

2
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Come along, David.

3
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,694
- Come on there, Harry boy. It's time.
- That's the trouble with this world today.

4
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,988
Everyone is in
such a blooming hurry.

5
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,825
- Goodnight, George.
- Goodnight. See you tomorrow.

6
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,866
It's time, mate.
You'll have to drink up.

7
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,203
- Now come on now.
- You heard me. We're closing.

8
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,795
You want to get rough-like,
do you? Come on.

9
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,274
Chum.

10
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,982
You've been and
gone and done it.

11
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,440
He's dead. You killed him.

12
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:23,953
Alright.

13
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,331
Stop him!

14
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,464
What did he do?

15
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,289
He killed the governor.
That's what he did.

16
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,638
Hey, what's going on here?

17
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,953
Did he pass you?
A big fella running?

18
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,325
- No. Nobody passed me.
- He must have gone this way then.

19
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,973
Who is it? What do you want?

20
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,136
We're looking for a man, missus.
He might be in one of these houses.

21
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,724
He's not in this house.

22
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:24,023
I keep this house respectable, I do.
And no thanks to the police, neither.

23
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:30,068
You won't get hurt if you
keep quiet. Understand?

24
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,535
You just try anything and I'll..

25
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,119
Don't make a move and
keep your mouth shut.

26
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,263
Do you live alone?

27
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,500
There's no sense in standing there. You
might as well make yourself comfortable.

28
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,793
I'm staying for a while.
You'd better get used to the idea.

29
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,570
There is nothing to be scared of.

30
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,489
Then why are you scared?

31
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,565
Where do you think you're going?

32
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:37,198
Nowhere at the moment, but in
about an hour I've a job to go to.

33
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,909
What makes you
think I'll let you go?

34
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,778
If you don't they'll send
someone down to see if I'm ill.

35
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,332
- Who is "they"?
- The institution. - The what?

36
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,751
The Mary Wilson institute.
I work in a clinic there.

37
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,215
I watched you
while you were sleeping.

38
00:09:58,932 --> 00:09:59,932
You talked.

39
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,392
What did I say?

40
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,684
Nothing incriminating.

41
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,403
How about some coffee?

42
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,154
There is tea here if you want it.

43
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,153
The milk is outside the front door.

44
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,158
We'll drink it without.

45
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,082
I don't like it without.

46
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,755
I'll fetch it.

47
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,423
I have to go.

48
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,007
How come you didn't tell the cops?

49
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,092
What time you get back?

50
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,350
About seven.

51
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,012
And I don't expect to find
you here when I do get back.

52
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:29,563
What if I am?

53
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,638
I hardly think you will be.

54
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,020
I'll stick around until it gets dark.

55
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,693
Did you Rob or kill someone?

56
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:41,735
That's what they think.

57
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,070
I was in a bar, drinking alone.

58
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,695
A fight started.. Somebody
got slugged and I ducked out.

59
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,080
I'm new around here, you see.

60
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:50,953
And they chased me.

61
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,372
- You sure that's all?
- Sure that's all.

62
00:11:58,927 --> 00:11:59,927
Just a minute.

63
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,679
Yes?

64
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:05,641
Nothing.

65
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,553
You're a good kid.

66
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,354
- Good morning, dear.
- Good morning, mrs Gale.

67
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,234
- Up early this morning, aren't you?
- I saw you going for the milk.

68
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,979
We expect rather a busy day.

69
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,939
Oh you needn't bother to do
my room. I've done it already.

70
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,577
Thank you, dear.

71
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,613
Not a peep out of
you, you understand?

72
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,536
- Will it hurt?
- A little.

73
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,415
- Will this make my ear better?
- Very soon. You'll see.

74
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,588
Now.. Take a deep breath.

75
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:11,963
There... that's all it is.

76
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,008
- I didn't cry.
- I didn't think you would.

77
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,303
- Next Monday, same time.
- Thank you so much, miss.

78
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,018
I'm sure your ear will
be better, Donald, so..

79
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,139
Have a nice weekend, but no
rough play now. Not until next week.

80
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,723
Have a nice weekend yourself.

81
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,017
- Thank you. Goodbye, Donald.
- Goodbye.

82
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:37,871
Hello.

83
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,905
Oh it's you. Yeah.

84
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:42,918
What do you want?

85
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,872
Nothing. I just
wanted to say hello.

86
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:46,922
Then, hello.

87
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,835
Let's get this straightened
out. I don't run a hotel.

88
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,949
- I'm not looking for one.
- What are you looking for?

89
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,588
Nothing. I'm not looking for nothing.

90
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,306
Do I have to call the police?

91
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,372
- What for? I only want to talk to you.
- But I don't like your talking to me.

92
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,261
I don't like you walking
along with me, either.

93
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,606
If I do call a policeman, he may like to
know you forced your way in my room.

94
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,855
And also the part you
played in that brawl.

95
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,190
- I told you what happened.
- A man was killed.

96
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,119
If you really want to know why
I ducked out, I'll tell you. I jumped ship.

97
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,365
I wasn't going to wait around for any
cops to pick me up. That's on the level.

98
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,616
I just stopped by to say
hello. And give you this.

99
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,955
Thanks. I thought..

100
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,703
You thought I'd lifted it, huh?

101
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,085
I don't go stealing stuff from
people that do me favors.

102
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,958
I just slipped it into
my pocket by mistake.

103
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,132
Well, I'm sorry.

104
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,507
But, do you mind
if I say goodbye now.

105
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:15,879
Must you follow me?

106
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,798
Maybe I've got
nothing better to do.

107
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,843
Oh, cut it out will you. Do you have to
be sore all the time? I won't hurt you.

108
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,970
Please leave me alone.
I don't know who you are.

109
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,427
What's the difference who I am?
I just want to talk to you.

110
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,474
My name is bill. Bill Saunders.

111
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,128
- That doesn't tell me very much.
- Alright, what do you want to know?

112
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,792
- I was born in Canada, raised in Detroit.
- Why don't you go back?

113
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,030
Go back?

114
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:36,698
To what?

115
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,071
Something. Someone.

116
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:39,782
There's nobody. Nothing.

117
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,001
You're pretty lonely yourself.

118
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,494
Come on. Let's get out of here.

119
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,467
What's the matter?
Haven't you seen a zoo before?

120
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,386
I've been in one all my life.

121
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,513
I don't like to be
reminded of it. That's all.

122
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:28,435
You're shaking.

123
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,593
I can't stand to see
anything caged up.

124
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,304
Have you never
been behind barbed wire?

125
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:34,601
Have you?

126
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,353
Almost two years
in a Nazi prison camp.

127
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,855
Being shoved around by those..

128
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,335
You think those monkeys are something?
You want to see men in cages.

129
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,868
Do you want some.. Peanuts?

130
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:49,831
Alright.

131
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:06,800
Your name is Jane?

132
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
I saw the book.

133
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,268
Oh.

134
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:13,807
Who is the officer?

135
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,596
- Who?
- The guy in the photo.

136
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,317
Oh.

137
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,433
That's loyd. He was killed.

138
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:22,947
Tough luck.

139
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:28,992
Did you get over it?

140
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,408
Do you get over things?

141
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,459
Do you ever go to the races?

142
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,370
- Horse racing?
- Uhuh. - No, I don't.

143
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,585
You ought to try it. You ought
to try everything once.

144
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:44,967
Will you go with
me this Saturday?

145
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,794
I won't bother you
until then if you do.

146
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,965
You are very strange.

147
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,936
Do you think we're late?

148
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,793
I guess we've missed the
first race. It don't matter.

149
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,273
It's the second race that counts.

150
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,570
Don't think I've come down here from
London with the object of making money.

151
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,857
I ask you.. Do I look
as if I needed money?

152
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,277
I come down here with
the sole and only purpose.

153
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,111
Of assisting you to return home.

154
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,868
Lighter in heart,
but heavier in pocket.

155
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,771
Each and every one of these
envelopes, ladies and gentlemen.

156
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,410
Contains the winner
of the second race.

157
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,644
Five shillings is the regular price
of the ordinary doubting Thomas.

158
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,506
But to you, ladies and gentlemen.

159
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,755
I will pass on this
red-hot information.

160
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,544
For just one paltry shilling.

161
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,008
One shilling, sir.

162
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:13,468
One, sir. One, sir.

163
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:14,851
One, sir.

164
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,103
One, sir?

165
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,521
One.

166
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,149
How many, lady?

167
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,390
Just a Bob.
Twelve miserable coppers.

168
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,476
- Beat it. Save it for the suckers.
- No, please.

169
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,690
- Here you are. Thank you very much.
- Thank you, lady.

170
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,029
2nd race.. "Sudden cloud".

171
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,115
Sudden cloud. Sudden cloud is..

172
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,612
Thirty-five to one.

173
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,270
- Isn't that a good horse?
- Sure, if all the others drop dead.

174
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,625
- I know what's going to win the 2nd race.
- You do?

175
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,955
"Dairy maid". It's a cinch.

176
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,358
- How can you be so sure?
- I got it straight from the jockey.

177
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,792
It's in the bag for dairy maid.

178
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:50,297
Anyway, I'm going to put a bet on sudden
cloud as it's such a wonderful name.

179
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,837
- What will I get if it wins?
- If it wins..

180
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,885
- You get 35 times what you put up.
- Oh, but that's too simple.

181
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,636
We'd better place our bets, then.

182
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:58,968
Here, put this on it.

183
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:02,396
You must be mad. A whole pound?
And I wouldn't take it from you.

184
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:06,188
I wouldn't think of putting on more than
a shilling. I'm a working girl, you know.

185
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,186
I would like to put a shilling
on sudden cloud, please.

186
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,109
35 to one lady.

187
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,120
He talked so fast I couldn't tell what
he said. But I suppose it's alright.

188
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,198
Will it start soon?

189
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,251
- So which one is sudden cloud?
- Number six. Right there.

190
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,290
- I can't see.
- She's six lengths behind.

191
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,632
I can't see a thing.

192
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,258
- Come on, sudden cloud.
- Where is she now?

193
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,456
- I don't know. Which is it?
- It's the jockey in blue.

194
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,595
Come on, sudden cloud.

195
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,437
- It's all over.
- Who won?

196
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:50,811
I don't know.

197
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,358
Look up there. The number board.

198
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,746
She won!

199
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,808
I knew she would. That little man
knew what he was talking about.

200
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,583
Oh, and your dairy maid.. I'm sorry.

201
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,642
Give me your tickets.
I'll collect for you.

202
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:07,999
Uhuh. That's half the fun.

203
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,667
Okay, go ahead. I'll wait here.

204
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,929
Hello, chum.. Fancy meeting you.

205
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,729
Afraid you've got the wrong guy.

206
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,856
Now you've hurt my feelings.
Because I remember you.

207
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:32,270
It does me good to see you walk about
as large as life and twice as handsome.

208
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,481
And free. Free as air.

209
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,912
It's alright. The girl won't
be back for a minute.

210
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,279
She's nice looking,
ain't she? Quite a lady.

211
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,625
- I told you I don't know you.
- Now take it easy.

212
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,950
I'm not a copper
and this ain't a touch.

213
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,084
So you've nothing to
worry about either way.

214
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:49,839
Get away from me.

215
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,751
Alright, alright, alright.

216
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,713
And if you should ever need
a friend, there is always Harry.

217
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,129
The day a pal of mine is in trouble,
that's the day I rise and shine.

218
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,970
Remember that.. A friend
in need is a friend indeed.

219
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:03,686
Robbie burns.

220
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:05,181
Goodbye, chum.

221
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,531
Two more. Altogether, that's
42 shillings to the good.

222
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:20,026
- A fine afternoon's work.
- All that money! It's wicked.

223
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,701
What do you want
to do? Give it back?

224
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,871
Take you to tea and miss
the crowds on the train.

225
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,084
- Oh I didn't ask you. How did you do?
- I didn't.

226
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,040
Oh.

227
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:30,056
- You come to the races often?
- Often enough. But never with a girl.

228
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:31,545
Oh, a likely story.

229
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,289
Never with a girl
as lucky as you.

230
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,015
I haven't had
a day like this for..

231
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,106
For a long time.

232
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,517
- It's been fun.
- Good.

233
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:51,057
No, really. I mean it.

234
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:53,809
Tired?

235
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,904
Hmm. I'm completely done
over, but it was worth it.

236
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,149
- You got a family?
- Nah. - Nobody?

237
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,489
Well, at least
we're alike that way.

238
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,701
- You're educated. Anybody can see that.
- Oh, can they?

239
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,249
I never got past the sixth grade.

240
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,291
What goes with you?

241
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:15,758
Oh, with me?

242
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,171
Well, I was a proper little girl.

243
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,552
Seen but not heard. Never
caused anybody any trouble.

244
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:23,117
Didn't help very much, did it?
They kicked your teeth in anyway.

245
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,177
The raf guy, I mean.

246
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,093
But I wasn't the only one.

247
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,187
What kind of a job have
you got at that place?

248
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:32,775
Oh.

249
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,476
I'm sort of...
Assistant to everybody.

250
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,607
- Like it?
- Hmm. Love it. I feel useful.

251
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,439
It is not a bad feeling.

252
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,122
Cigarette?

253
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,073
- [T isn't a smoker.
- Oh.

254
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,501
But go ahead.

255
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,211
Alright.

256
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,905
You and me is always bumping into each
other. Ha.. Must be in our horoscopes.

257
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,493
A good sign, eh?

258
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,865
Your young lady friend seems a bit
keen on you. Anyone can see that.

259
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,455
But then of course,
you're the sort they all go for.

260
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,622
Flappers and ladies.

261
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,211
I said "lady".

262
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,123
Confidentially, I saw you
counting your money just now.

263
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,088
It wasn't much of a count, was it.

264
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,300
No. It wasn't.

265
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,208
You know, I took a shine to
you the first time I seen you.

266
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,094
- That night in the pub.
- Shut up.

267
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,299
Can you imagine...?

268
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,760
I can't even remember
the name of it now.

269
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,519
Here.

270
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:52,724
There is a certain
proposition I've heard of.

271
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,434
A proposition?

272
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,286
Oh, just a little business venture
of mine. I could do with a partner.

273
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,564
A young man. Strong, courageous.
Handy with his fists.

274
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:02,863
There's fifty quid in it.

275
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,404
- Nothing doing.
- Reformed, eh?

276
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:09,070
Stop blocking the corridor, please.

277
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:11,624
Look here.

278
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,824
If you want to
impress the young lady.

279
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,911
Don't forget that sort
of thing takes money.

280
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,761
No objection if I sit here?

281
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,809
- Mind if I put up my feet?
- No. Not at all.

282
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,934
Oh that's better. I've
been on my feet all day.

283
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,016
I mustn't grumble though.
I've had a very good day.

284
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:44,321
I'm in artificial fuel. Thermal-cake.
It looks like coal, burns like coal.

285
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,324
Lasts longer. Smells better.
Ever tried it, miss?

286
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,280
No, I don't believe I have.

287
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:51,872
Well.

288
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:54,118
In case you should
ever want any, here.

289
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:58,827
- Are you together?
- Yeah.

290
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:15,473
I don't know what I'd do
without the devil's picture-books.

291
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,680
Traveling about like this.

292
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,766
A fellow has got to
keep his mind occupied.

293
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:23,446
Like card tricks?

294
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,658
You, miss?

295
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:28,951
Not particularly.

296
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,365
Here's one I bet you never saw.
Take a card. Any card.

297
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,039
Now look at it.
Don't show it to me.

298
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,208
Now put it back.
Remember what it was.

299
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,629
Got it?

300
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,915
Two of diamonds. What?

301
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:46,302
That's very good.

302
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,626
Have you seen this one?

303
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,470
King, queen, Jack of spades.

304
00:30:58,815 --> 00:30:59,975
Which one is the queen?

305
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,735
Oh.. That's good, bill.

306
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:08,485
Sleight of hand. Deceives the
eye and all that you know.

307
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,950
Take another card.

308
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:19,329
No, no, no. There is your queen.

309
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:21,837
Not bad.

310
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,251
I've a natural eye. Probably
from doing tricks myself.

311
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:28,834
I still think I can fool you.

312
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,627
I doubt it. I doubt it.

313
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:31,844
Want to try?

314
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,134
Don't care if I do. But I'm
warning you, though.

315
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,602
Cover that.

316
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:38,646
Well.

317
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:40,766
Well.

318
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:42,723
I don't mind if I do.

319
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:48,489
That one.

320
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:51,398
Say, you are quick.

321
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,074
That's me, alright.

322
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,244
I bet I can still fool you.
Try again, double.

323
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,129
Not for me.

324
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:05,754
I said try again. Double.

325
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,457
I said no. Clear, isn't it?

326
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:11,467
Come on. Pick a card.

327
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,007
What do you think I am?

328
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,882
I wasn't born in the world to be
cheated by an incompetent card-sharp.

329
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,220
You'd better play!

330
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,137
Bill.

331
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:22,187
And you'd better take some more
lessons, my fine feathered friend.

332
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:23,691
Bill, don't!

333
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,315
Help.. Help!

334
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:45,877
Take your hands off me!

335
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,569
You shouldn't have pulled the cord. We'd
have been right if you'd kept your head.

336
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,254
Come on. I'm not going with you.

337
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:52,761
What's the matter?

338
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,595
Him? He was no good. Did you
see the way he looked at you?

339
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,547
I don't ever want
to see you again.

340
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,069
Listen, will you.

341
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,074
I didn't do it just for the
sake of it. I had to.

342
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,271
One of me, one of him.

343
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,011
- He had a nice time of..
- I was out of my mind to go with you.

344
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,070
Have a nice time?

345
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,947
Yes, I thought I was
wrong about you, but..

346
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,953
Now I see you as you really are.
You are everything bad.

347
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:22,865
I never did you any harm.

348
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,168
Didn't you?

349
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,087
Jane.

350
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,333
- Will you please let me go.
- Listen to me.

351
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,144
There is nobody else I want to be with.
Nobody else I want to talk to.

352
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,880
What's wrong with that?

353
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,291
I'll tell you what's wrong.
You're wrong. You are a coward.

354
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,093
There was one of
him and one of you.

355
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:42,593
He was an older man. I suppose if you'd
hit a child, you'd say the same thing.

356
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:46,271
What's the matter with you? Why can't
you be decent like everybody else?

357
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,144
You're nothing but a
cheap, vicious bully.

358
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,189
Jane.. Janel

359
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,988
come on now. Let's
leave this young lady be.

360
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:09,745
William earle Saunders.

361
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:13,294
You have been found guilty
on two serious counts.

362
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,714
The first, robbery with
violence against one..

363
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,090
Thomas widgery.

364
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,381
The second, a savage and
unprovoked attack..

365
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,434
Against an officer of the law in
the execution of his duties.

366
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,682
Have you anything to
say in your defense?

367
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:28,524
No.

368
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,816
I then sentence you,
William earle Saunders.

369
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,603
To six months hard
labor on each count.

370
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,696
Sentences to run concurrently.

371
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,325
Furthermore.

372
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,533
Although these appear
to be first offenses.

373
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,407
In view of the brutal
nature of the assaults.

374
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,283
I have no alternative.

375
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:49,785
But to direct that you receive
eighteen strokes of the cat-of-nine-tails.

376
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:51,857
Go.

377
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,445
Go.

378
00:35:58,323 --> 00:35:59,323
Go.

379
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,118
Go.

380
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:10,894
This table taken?

381
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,396
Help yourself.

382
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,791
Waiting for someone, mate?

383
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,088
Care to run a few?

384
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:39,757
No.

385
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,293
Just for sport, mate.

386
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,678
Yeah.

387
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:57,310
Just a wee bit more english,
as they say.. Eh, chum?

388
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,603
You sure get around, don't you.

389
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,443
How are you feeling after
your little vacation, eh?

390
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,692
Great. I'm happy to hear that.

391
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:09,870
Truly I am.

392
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:13,283
You know, you've been popping in and
out of my thoughts like a blooming rabbit.

393
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,868
Here, George. Come over here.

394
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,579
How about a little game
of snooker on me, eh?

395
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,002
Here, set them up,
my little cock-sparrow.

396
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,335
How you fixed?
Got anything in view?

397
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,591
A nice, pleasing situation?

398
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,472
Fixing to blow soon.
Get out of town.

399
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,470
Naturally, you have
all my sympathies.

400
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,718
A man that's gone
through what you have.

401
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,314
But you should need a bit of the
old readies to move around on.

402
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,065
How you placed that way?

403
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:42,274
I'll get by.

404
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,353
Of course you will.
Of course you will.

405
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,150
Why, you're a man who
would get by wherever you are.

406
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,240
But if you should need a little..

407
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,530
Extra spondulix.

408
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,120
Just to tide you over,
sort of get you on your feet.

409
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:55,579
I don't need a thing.

410
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,661
Here, now that ain't
exactly true you know.

411
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,867
We all need a bit
more than we've got.

412
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,460
But you mustn't let your temper
get the better of your judgment.

413
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,833
That's been many
a good man's downfall.

414
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:10,470
Look before you.. Hit.

415
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,884
That's what I always say.

416
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,387
Come on, come on.
What's on your mind? Spill it.

417
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,389
Ah you see, how
you're being reasonable.

418
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,107
Here.

419
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:21,727
Get yourself a cup.

420
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,440
You know, it seems to me..

421
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:31,024
That there are too many people walking
about these days who can afford to ride.

422
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,405
Given the opportunity.

423
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,414
- I don't get you.
- Here, just a minute.

424
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,624
Have you ever stopped to
think about petrol coupons?

425
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:49,172
There is a tidy little sum in it,
if you know how to handle them.

426
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,241
Yeah. And there's a tidy little stretch
in the pen if you get caught.

427
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:54,425
Well of course, if you've got
something better in view.

428
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,805
Like a job in an office or
behind the bars in a bank.

429
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,766
Something nice and cosy.

430
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,310
You know what I've got.

431
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,060
Suppose it is a deal.

432
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:11,402
Oh.. I've been waiting a long
time to hear you say that.

433
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,112
Patience and luck.
That's my motto.

434
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,902
That's got me where I am.

435
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,863
You and me could have a
rare partnership together.

436
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,119
Now let's get this straight.

437
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,623
All I want is a one shot deal
for a bankroll and then I blow.

438
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,747
You can find me at
number 7 markwell place.

439
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,552
Seven.

440
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,093
That's a lucky number, that is.

441
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,866
Hello, bill.

442
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,569
I tried to find what day
you were coming out.

443
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:00,454
You did?

444
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,241
Yes, but it seems you have
to be a relative or something.

445
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:08,042
I thought you
had forgotten about me.

446
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:10,965
I thought a lot about you.

447
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,428
Yeah.

448
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,553
I thought how
wrong it was that you..

449
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,346
You ever got mixed
up with a guy like me.

450
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,008
I guess we didn't make
much sense together.

451
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,262
It is very close this evening.

452
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,436
It seems fine to me.

453
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,563
I guess any place would.

454
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,736
Six months in there is..

455
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,563
It's like a whole life.

456
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:34,825
Good evening.

457
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,407
Good evening, mrs Gale.

458
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:41,700
- Cigarette?
- No thank you.

459
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:45,875
What have you been doing?

460
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:50,046
I had dinner with a girlfriend
and we went to the pictures.

461
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,170
- Every night?
- No.

462
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,300
The building is almost finished.

463
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,549
Yes, it's been a long time,

464
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,433
what are you going to do?

465
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:09,357
Get some money together.

466
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:10,944
Beat it.

467
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,731
- Beat it, where?
- Oh, I don't know.

468
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,482
Canada maybe. Some place.

469
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:16,575
Make a new start.

470
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,491
They need a lorry
driver at the institute.

471
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,907
I could talk to dr Travis
in the morning.

472
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,790
You?

473
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,198
You can drive, can't you?

474
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:27,208
Yeah.. But why?

475
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,327
You would be out in the open
most of the time on your own.

476
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,921
Wouldn't you like
that sort of a job?

477
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,299
I don't know why
you want to do this.

478
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:38,253
What are you going
to them about me?

479
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,462
About where I've been.

480
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,219
The truth, and that you
are a friend of mine.

481
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,391
It's been nice seeing you, bill.

482
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:45,604
Goodnight.

483
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:47,773
Goodnight.

484
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,062
It sounds a little rough.
You'd better lean it up a bit.

485
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:09,086
Yeah, it needs..

486
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,161
What do you know about it?

487
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,792
I drove an ambulance for four
years in the fire service.

488
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:18,293
You should have seen me. Trousers,
battle jacket, great heavy boots.

489
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,385
And my language.

490
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:49,783
How you blowing, chum?

491
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,022
- What are you doing here?
- Keeping you pretty busy, ain't they.

492
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:55,497
I see you're working overtime.

493
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,586
- Who told you?
- It's up on the board there.

494
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,792
Leaving for evesham at 8 o'clock.

495
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,421
- A tidy little run, eh?
- Listen, I'm busy.

496
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,591
All manner of things,
you're tucking away in there.

497
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,514
A marvelous assortment.

498
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,392
Penicillin and sulphur
drugs and who knows what.

499
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,186
Here.. It's as plain as
the nose on your face.

500
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:17,727
Here is your one-shot deal right here.

501
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:19,445
And Harry knows how to handle it.

502
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,491
You do, huh?

503
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:24,179
Of course, we couldn't pull it off
over here. But on the continent...?

504
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,693
You know what it's like over there.

505
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:26,746
Human misery.

506
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:28,954
And do you know what goes
with misery? Suffering.

507
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:30,873
And what goes with suffering?

508
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,457
A fortune.

509
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,539
You're nuts. You'd never
get it out of the country.

510
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,712
I'd get it through the gates
of heaven if I had to.

511
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:38,540
I've got a connection.

512
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,333
The skipper of the pelicano.

513
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:42,544
Just arrived off Gravesend.

514
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,222
He'd take it.

515
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,640
And you, too.

516
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:49,887
I'm doing alright where I am.

517
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,185
Do you know, I can't
understand you, chum.

518
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,521
You seem to have
forgotten something.

519
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,974
Remember what's
hanging over your head.

520
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,863
You took a long time
getting around to that.

521
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:10,363
And don't forget I wasn't the only one
in the anchor & dolphin that night.

522
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,493
You'd better see things my way.

523
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,743
Why, with this under your belt,
you'll be sitting pretty.

524
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,296
Out of the country.
Your pockets lined.

525
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,377
And cocking a snook at the world.

526
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:26,004
No Harry to remind you of a thing that
happened once in the heat of the moment.

527
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:27,599
See?

528
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,518
Now take it easy, chum.

529
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:44,985
Old Harry may not have the muscle on him
but he has what it takes just the same.

530
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:48,067
What would happen if I
phoned the coppers?

531
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:50,403
They'd hang you, wouldn't they.

532
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,040
Hang you.

533
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,701
But of course if you want to stick to
your job we can arrange that, too.

534
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,249
We'll make you look
a picture of innocence.

535
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,174
Stop the truck.

536
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:04,337
Beat you up proper scientific,
and no-one would be any the wiser.

537
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,636
And you can trust me to see
that you get your money.

538
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:08,929
I don't want any money.

539
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:14,097
Alright.. I'll let you pull this off.

540
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,391
That will square us.
You'll be paid off.

541
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:19,682
But if you ever bother
me again, I'll kill you.

542
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:22,022
You know, you're
cheapening yourself, chum.

543
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:25,205
- Of course, if that's the way you want it.
- That's the way I want it.

544
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,828
The last thing you're ever
going to want from me.

545
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,955
You'll be taking the
blackwall tunnel, won't you?

546
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,824
I'll be waiting outside
the entrance at 8:30.

547
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:35,114
I'll bring a couple of
the lads along with me.

548
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:38,496
They'll leave you looking as though
a blooming train ran right over you.

549
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,665
No real harm done.

550
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,706
You know, their skill..

551
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,917
Amazes me, sometimes.

552
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,347
Look here.

553
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:51,301
This is important to me.

554
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:54,137
So don't play no tricks on Harry.

555
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:02,883
After you leave the blackwall tunnel,
take the maidstone road.

556
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,602
You'll have no trouble finding evesham.

557
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:08,231
I hope they can stop this Scarlet fever
before it becomes an epidemic.

558
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,361
I'm sorry about this.

559
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,528
I know you've had some long hours
recently, but we'll make it up to you.

560
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,075
- Take tomorrow off.
- Thanks.

561
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:43,353
Hello driver. Hurry and
come in out of the rain.

562
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,687
It's a horrid night for a long drive.

563
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:49,949
I don't mind.

564
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,740
Want a lift? Drop you home?

565
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,526
No. I'm going with you.

566
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:58,372
But.. I thought you'd be pleased.
They're short of staff in evesham so..

567
00:47:58,918 --> 00:47:59,918
I volunteered.

568
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,721
They.. They could have sent someone
else. You've been working all day.

569
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:05,538
Don't you want
me to go with you?

570
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:06,876
Sure. Sure I do.

571
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:10,968
- Is anything the matter, bill?
- No.. No.

572
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,886
We'd better get started.

573
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:28,190
You are becoming quite a popular
character around the institute.

574
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,564
- Am I?
- Yes. Everyone likes you.

575
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:37,028
Not getting tired
of your job are you?

576
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,456
No. I like it.

577
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,206
I thought you did.
You seemed happy.

578
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,126
Not just the job.

579
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,844
You've never been around
evesham before have you.

580
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,799
- No. What's it like?
- Oh, it's beautiful down there.

581
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,720
I guess we won't see much of it.

582
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,188
Here he comes.

583
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,279
That man signaled us.
He seems to be in trouble.

584
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:14,576
Yeah. He did.

585
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:16,818
I'll see what he wants.

586
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,500
You wait here.

587
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:40,223
You had me scared for a minute.
Sailing by like that.

588
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:41,850
You splashed me, too.

589
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:43,598
Are these your friends?

590
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,054
Felix, this is mr Saunders.

591
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,992
- Pleased to meet you.
- And this is Charlie.

592
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:49,016
Didn't I see someone
with you in the lorry?

593
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:49,934
Yeah.

594
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,424
- We're not going through with it tonight.
- What's that?

595
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:54,808
I didn't know she'd be coming along.
They needed extra help.

596
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:56,403
"She"? You mean
the same young lady?

597
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:58,533
I'll be carrying another
load one of these days.

598
00:49:58,621 --> 00:49:59,736
One of these days.

599
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,788
The skipper of the
pelicano is ready tonight.

600
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:06,834
The skipper will have to wait.

601
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,960
We'll have to rough up
the young lady, too.

602
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:12,044
Unless you leave her behind
and come along with me.

603
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:15,759
I said it's off tonight.

604
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,178
Billl

605
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:01,381
oh, there you are! You were
so long and I began to worry.

606
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,846
- What happened?
- Nothing. The fellow lost his way.

607
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,056
Had to set him straight.

608
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,073
You know what you've got to
do when you get to evesham?

609
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:28,912
There's a dr paton waiting for us. We'll
likely cope with the new cases tonight.

610
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,872
And do preventative
inoculations in the morning.

611
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,211
You're not going to get
much rest are you.

612
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:34,799
Neither are you.

613
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:49,345
Nobody thought it would spread so quick,
but the penicillin will stop it, surely.

614
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:50,350
Can't miss.

615
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:53,399
That's very reassuring. Believe me.
When it's your own child.

616
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:55,614
- You've got nothing to worry about.
- Thank you.

617
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:56,776
Thank you very much.

618
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:59,571
I don't know what dr paton is going
to do about that Thomas girl.

619
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:02,721
She was the first to come down with the
fever and the doctor can't get near her.

620
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:05,077
- What's the trouble?
- It's her father, Luther Thomas.

621
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:08,476
They lost their first to diphtheria. He
thinks it's the inoculations that did it.

622
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,580
Why, that's crazy.

623
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:11,667
Thomas is a good man but
he won't listen to anybody.

624
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,415
He won't let the
doctor near the girl.

625
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,416
Constable, you're
wanted on the telephone.

626
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:26,559
Hello?

627
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:32,315
I see.

628
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,108
Right.

629
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:36,845
- Is that all there is to go, bill?
- This is the last load.

630
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:40,112
Dr paton has given us a long list of
houses. We've a long, busy night ahead.

631
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,360
Mrs paton is going along
to show us the way.

632
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:45,722
It sounds to me as if the young fellows
had a drop too much to drink.

633
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:47,577
Put his head under the
pump and send him home.

634
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,757
This one over here.
Number seven.

635
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:16,301
Mr Thomas was quite violent
the last time the doctor called.

636
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:20,863
What do you want?

637
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,904
Mr Thomas, this young
lady is from London.

638
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:25,838
- We don't want to see anybody.
- Can't I speak to you for a moment?

639
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,076
I'm not listening to anybody.

640
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:31,144
My little girl is going to get
better without any of your help.

641
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,785
- Get out!
- Now look, mr Thomas.

642
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,700
- You too. Get out!
- Don't you think...?

643
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,295
- Now listen.
- Leave us alone!

644
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:52,854
We're going in.

645
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:56,854
Now you listen to me.

646
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:01,690
I've seen this stuff work on hundreds
of kids. For all kinds of things.

647
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,230
It will only take a minute.

648
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:08,181
If anything happens to your
little girl, it will be your fault.

649
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:13,624
Go on in, Jane.

650
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,182
Are you rushing back for
any special reason, bill?

651
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,601
Huh.. No, I..

652
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:38,460
I should think you'd be in a hurry
to get home. Get some sleep.

653
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:41,324
No, I'm not the least bit tired.
In fact, I've never felt so wide awake.

654
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:43,102
Hard work does that sometimes.

655
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:46,526
Oh, did you ever
see anything so lovely?

656
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,363
We do have the rest
of the day off, bill.

657
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:53,408
There is some
place you'd like to go?

658
00:54:53,874 --> 00:54:55,830
No, I'd just like to stop
and look for a while.

659
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:52,890
I love you, Jane.

660
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:55,845
- You don't know how much I love you.
- Oh, I do. I do.

661
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:59,766
I loved you for a long
time without knowing it.

662
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:02,940
It's just that something kept
me from thinking the same.

663
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:06,863
Jane.

664
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,151
- Not falling asleep, are you?
- Hmm.

665
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:12,285
Just dreaming.

666
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:14,245
About us?

667
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:16,578
I wish we could stay here forever.

668
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,239
A sort-of forever, anyway.

669
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,615
I'll settle for that.

670
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:23,789
It's getting kind of cool.

671
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:28,089
Don't leave me, bill.

672
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,875
Because you're afraid.

673
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:31,718
Afraid? Afraid of what?

674
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,921
That you were
thinking of going away.

675
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:38,721
All through our drive to evesham, I..

676
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,011
I was almost sorry I'd come along.

677
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,055
Then this morning I..

678
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:47,689
That's why I wanted to stop. To tell
you how much you meant to me and..

679
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,775
How you've made me begin
to think of other things.

680
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:52,901
Just the things I had lost.

681
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,694
I was thinking of going away,

682
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,165
is anything the matter, bill?

683
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:04,337
No, it's..

684
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:05,998
It's just that I..

685
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,714
I've got no place in your life.

686
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,503
I don't want to make you unhappy.

687
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:13,846
You won't.

688
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,047
Would you go anywhere with me?

689
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:21,009
Yes, but we're
doing what we like now.

690
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:22,803
We'll always be together.

691
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:24,847
Where would you want to go?

692
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:28,653
I don't know. I..

693
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,065
I don't want to go anywhere.
I just want to be with you.

694
00:57:58,684 --> 00:57:59,684
Harry.

695
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:03,396
Harry!

696
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,136
Yes?

697
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:49,936
I hope you'll pardon this intrusion,
but I'm a friend. A friend of bill's.

698
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,272
Oh.. Won't you come in?

699
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,483
Are you sure I'm not intruding?

700
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,735
No, not at all. Please sit down.

701
00:58:59,161 --> 00:59:00,161
Ta.

702
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:04,489
Oh pardon me, but I use a
little hair-oil now and then.

703
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,412
You still haven't told me your name.

704
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:10,994
Harry.. Harry Carter.

705
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:14,039
Bill hasn't ever mentioned you before.

706
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:17,672
That's just like his little ways,
isn't it. But he's a good sort, though.

707
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,053
I've no need to
tell you that, though.

708
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:22,756
I've got a soft spot for him, too.

709
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,554
That's why I took the
Liberty of coming to you.

710
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,761
I've been troubled about him.

711
00:59:29,024 --> 00:59:30,024
Why?

712
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,348
Well, it's his job.

713
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,850
What do you mean, exactly?
Everything is going splendidly.

714
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,400
Well, in a manner of
speaking, I suppose it is.

715
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,314
Here.

716
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:42,283
I got you a little present.
With my best respects.

717
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,624
I do hope you don't think
it's too forward of me.

718
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,078
I'm afraid I don't understand
what you're getting at.

719
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:50,085
They are the best on the market. Not
easy to lay your hands on, these days.

720
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:52,126
You still haven't explained, mr Carter.

721
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:53,958
That's alright.
Just you call me Harry.

722
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,422
Anyway, me and bill is partners.

723
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:59,960
And just recently everything has
been going very well indeed.

724
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:02,046
And then, all of a sudden.

725
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:03,474
He goes to pieces.

726
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:05,643
Now why, I wonder?

727
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:10,097
I don't think for a moment that you are
a friend of bill's. What is it you want?

728
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:11,934
You can be honest with me.

729
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:15,688
Could it be that the little
lady went for a little ride..

730
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:18,023
And whispered
something in his ear, eh?

731
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:19,782
What is all this?

732
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:22,319
All that valuable stuff at the clinic.

733
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,154
We had it all sewed up.

734
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:27,703
I was going to make the arrangements
and he was going to make the deliveries.

735
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:32,334
If you don't get out of here,
I shall call the police.

736
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:35,333
If I were you young lady,
I'd ask bill's permission first.

737
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:38,317
If bill were here, he'd take you
by the scruff of your neck and..

738
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:39,385
And Chuck me out?

739
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:43,511
You put me in a really awkward position.
I don't know quite where to begin.

740
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:47,557
Supposing we go back about
eight months. A Tuesday night.

741
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:50,598
At the anchor & dolphin.
Ever heard of the place?

742
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:53,396
Yes, I have.

743
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:56,016
Well, it was just on closing
time. I was drinking up.

744
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,185
And all of a sudden,
there was trouble.

745
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:02,072
The next thing I know, there
was a man lying dead on the floor.

746
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:04,073
Bill had killed him.

747
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:06,693
Bill didn't kill him.
He told me he didn't.

748
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,533
He ran away
because he jumped ship.

749
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,113
The police wouldn't think so.

750
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:11,792
You are lying.

751
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,620
The police would believe me.

752
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:15,960
And the barmaid.

753
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:20,165
But it's safe with me, janey.

754
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:23,343
Because you're going to
work with us, aren't you.

755
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,170
That's all I'm here for.

756
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,343
Just a little cooperation.

757
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,849
Everything smooth and friendly.

758
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,226
No more misunderstandings.

759
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:37,149
No more leaving Harry standing
in the rain next time, eh janey?

760
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,434
You and I will see to that.

761
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:42,069
- Just good friends.
- Don't touch me.

762
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:46,066
You ought to know
better than that.

763
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:49,702
But it's alright.

764
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:51,957
It's only me.

765
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:54,335
Harry.

766
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:59,208
But I'm going to
run things from now on.

767
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:03,423
And when I raise my thumb
you're going to jump to it.

768
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,553
Nol

769
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:05,930
happy.

770
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:07,473
Together.

771
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,173
Nice and cosy.

772
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:31,073
Any trouble, miss?

773
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:58,357
Bill.

774
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:00,484
Bill.

775
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,154
Jane.

776
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:06,446
What's wrong? What happened?

777
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:22,587
Tell me Jane. What is it?

778
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:24,425
Tell me.

779
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:28,119
He came in and startled me.
He said he was a friend of yours.

780
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:31,717
He started talking about you.
He said his name was Harry.

781
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:35,492
He said you killed that man at the
anchor & dolphin. And then he..

782
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,226
He tried to make me think that..

783
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:41,640
And then he came close to me and he
put his hands on me. And I stabbed him.

784
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:45,643
Stabbed?

785
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,270
I think I killed him.

786
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:51,327
Jane, tell me.

787
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:53,318
You left him in your room?

788
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:55,737
When he fell down,
I just walked out.

789
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:00,534
What have I done to you?

790
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:09,178
Look, Jane.

791
01:04:09,721 --> 01:04:11,086
- I'm going now.
- Going where?

792
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:13,342
- I'll be back soon.
- Can't I go with you? - No.

793
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,636
It's just for just a little while.
You must wait here.

794
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,095
You've got to do as I tell you.

795
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,480
Alright.

796
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,400
Bill.

797
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:28,440
You just wait here.

798
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:31,648
Everything will be alright.

799
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:04,938
I'm hurt, chum.

800
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:06,975
She hurt me bad.

801
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:14,699
But I ain't going to die.

802
01:05:15,203 --> 01:05:16,318
I've stopped bleeding.

803
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:19,905
No, you're not going to die.
Not here anyway.

804
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:23,287
- Get me a doctor, chum.
- I'll get one when we're out of here.

805
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,876
No.. I'm not leaving.

806
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:26,954
You'll be right if you don't
waste too much time.

807
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:27,665
No.

808
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,123
- Get up, or I'll finish the job.
- No! - Get up.

809
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,794
Here.. Where are you taking me?

810
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:36,386
I'm taking you home.

811
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:39,086
I don't want to hear a sound
out of you until we get there.

812
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:56,816
- Here. Keep the change.
- Thank you.

813
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:02,159
- He's had a skin-full, ain't he.
- Yeah.

814
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:05,295
By the time he's slept it off he won't
remember a blooming thing tomorrow.

815
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,118
- I guess not.
- Goodbye, chum.

816
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:08,464
Goodnight.

817
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:32,404
Better lie down.

818
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:36,440
Now.. I'm alright now.

819
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:40,363
I could use a drink.

820
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:47,909
I'm going to get you a doctor.

821
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:50,081
And you're going to tell..

822
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:52,667
You'll get me a doctor.

823
01:06:53,635 --> 01:06:55,171
I'll have a quicker way to get help.

824
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:58,261
That girl and you
double-crossing me.

825
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,804
I'll tell you what
I'll tell the coppers.

826
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:03,349
I was paying her a friendly visit.

827
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:05,225
And she stabbed me.

828
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,762
Yeah.. The law will..

829
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:09,560
Deal hard with her.

830
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:14,905
If I die.

831
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:17,484
They'll hang the pair of you.

832
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:01,156
Where can I find the
skipper of the pelicano?

833
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:02,244
Up on the bridge.

834
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:07,499
What do you want?

835
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:11,542
A passage for two
and no questions asked.

836
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:14,166
You have the wrong ship, mister.

837
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:15,876
We carry cargo.

838
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,345
We still carry cargo.

839
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:29,229
Enough?

840
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:33,681
No. It's all I've got.

841
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:38,023
What about the other party?

842
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:40,032
It's a woman.

843
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:41,617
My wife.

844
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:43,278
It's not worth the risk.

845
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:49,493
I'm a friend of Harry's.

846
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,201
- I know a lot of Harrys.
- You know this one.

847
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,081
He had a deal with you.

848
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:04,973
What went wrong?

849
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:07,507
He couldn't swing it.

850
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:12,314
Could you?

851
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:16,440
It might make a lot of difference.

852
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:19,276
It's too tough. I can't do it.

853
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:20,864
Why?

854
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:22,321
Isn't she worth it?

855
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:27,444
Itis 10:24.
I have my sailing orders.

856
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:30,037
I have to be out
of the harbor by 12.

857
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,740
You think you can make it?

858
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:42,106
"Hello, janey."

859
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:47,156
"It was in the anchor & dolphin."

860
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:49,654
"Ever heard of the place?"

861
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:53,454
"A man is lying dead on the floor."

862
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,740
"Bill had killed him."

863
01:10:57,462 --> 01:11:01,796
"No more leaving Harry standing
in the rain, next time, eh janey?"

864
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:05,465
"The police will believe me."

865
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,135
"And the barmaid."

866
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:11,301
"It's only me."

867
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:13,185
"Harry."

868
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:15,353
"Harry."

869
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:16,980
"Together."

870
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:20,231
"Nice and cosy."

871
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,434
Jane... Jane.

872
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:23,099
Oh, I thought I'd never find you.

873
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:24,771
Why did you leave the room?

874
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:27,225
I am so glad to see you.
I was so afraid I..

875
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,690
I thought I heard
Harry's voice, but I..

876
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:33,992
Jane, look.

877
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:35,615
I went to your room.

878
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:37,033
Harry wasn't there.

879
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:40,451
You couldn't have done more than scratch
the guy as he got free, and ran away.

880
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:41,833
He wasn't there?

881
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:43,499
No. He wasn't there.

882
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,247
Oh, thank goodness.

883
01:13:47,131 --> 01:13:49,372
But he may have gone
to the police about you.

884
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,211
Jane, look.
We don't have much time.

885
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:54,406
There is a ship leaving for Lisbon
tonight. We can still make it.

886
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,716
We'll go to Canada, the states.
Any place we can be alone.

887
01:13:56,891 --> 01:13:59,371
Where people will let us alone.
We'll be together. Will you go?

888
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:02,013
Yes. All I want to
do is be with you.

889
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:03,678
Alright, come on. Let's hurry.

890
01:14:38,766 --> 01:14:39,766
Funny.

891
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,553
Every headlight is a police car.

892
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:44,305
I'm sure it's a cop.

893
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:46,891
But they won't stop us.

894
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:48,932
Nobody will stop us.

895
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:09,536
It's full of supplies.

896
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:11,879
No. They are empty cartons.

897
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:19,681
We'll make it.

898
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:23,101
What's the matter?

899
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:25,013
- What are you thinking about?
- It's cold.

900
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:26,938
Take my coat.

901
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:58,091
- Jane. - I killed him.
- Jane, please. - I did, I did.

902
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:00,547
- He was no good, it wasn't your fault.
- I killed him.

903
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:07,684
- I can't go.
- You've got to.

904
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:11,601
No, bill. I've never loved anyone
so much, ever. But I can't go.

905
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,057
What do you want us to do?

906
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:14,771
- I've got to go back.
- What for?

907
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:16,394
No-one can prove anything.

908
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:18,529
No-one has to prove anything.
I know what I've done.

909
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:21,190
What have you done that
I haven't made you do?

910
01:16:21,452 --> 01:16:23,172
- You haven't done anything.
- Bill, please.

911
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:25,528
You can say it was
self-defense and get off.

912
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:28,060
But if I go back I won't get off.
I'll be sticking my head in a rope.

913
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:29,244
Is that what you want?

914
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:31,975
No. That man at the anchor & dolphin.
That was an accident, was it?

915
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:33,619
Maybe it was.
Maybe I meant to kill him.

916
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:35,044
There's a difference.

917
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:37,069
- Who's going to believe that?
- They might understand.

918
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:39,300
Listen, no-one gives anybody
a break. Not me, anyway.

919
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:41,377
Run, run, run. All the time.

920
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:43,882
Run from my old man.
Run from the kid I hurt in school.

921
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:46,773
That's why I didn't mind the army.
When you hit, you didn't have to run.

922
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:48,342
Everybody is against you. Everybody!

923
01:16:49,814 --> 01:16:51,054
I'm not, bill. I love you.

924
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,482
Then listen to me, Jane.

925
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:57,814
We'll find a place.

926
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:01,129
It won't be the sort of life we
planned this afternoon on the hill.

927
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:03,899
We will, we will. We'll have that, too.

928
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,235
We'll be alone. Well be hunted.

929
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:09,121
There is nothing else.

930
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,740
Do you think it's just
the man in the pub?

931
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:14,876
The stuff in the truck is drugs alright.
I stole them to pay for our passage.

932
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:16,836
Jane, don't leave me!

933
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:18,133
Don't go.

934
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:25,300
I need you.

935
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,059
Oh, I need you.

936
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:34,351
I don't know what's best for you.

937
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:36,151
All it know is.

938
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:38,775
What I can't do is I can't run
away from the thing I've done.

939
01:17:39,864 --> 01:17:41,855
And I know I don't
want to live without you.

940
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,036
I didn't want to be alone anymore.

941
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:52,873
I don't want to be alone now.

942
01:17:54,837 --> 01:17:55,872
If we go back.

943
01:17:56,922 --> 01:17:58,002
If we stick together.

944
01:17:58,924 --> 01:17:59,924
If we face it.

945
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:02,423
Do you think that...?

946
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:04,130
Maybe somewhere.

947
01:18:05,139 --> 01:18:06,254
Somebody will listen.

948
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:09,177
Somebody will say it
wasn't all our fault?

949
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:12,722
Not yours anyway.

950
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:24,988
Maybe they'll give us a break.

951
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:27,487
Maybe they won't.

952
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:31,157
We'll see.
