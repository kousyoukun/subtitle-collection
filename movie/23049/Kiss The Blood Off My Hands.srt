00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,522
Taftermath of war is rubble...
the rubble of cities and of men...

4
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:47,073
They are the casualties
of a pitiless destruction.

5
00:01:47,537 --> 00:01:49,671
The cities can be rebuilt,
but the wounds of men,

6
00:01:49,998 --> 00:01:52,864
wheder of the mind or of
the body, heal slowly.

7
00:01:58,713 --> 00:02:04,657
This is the story of one such man:
and of the girl whose path he crossed...

8
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:24,694
Time gentlemen. Drink up.

9
00:02:34,713 --> 00:02:35,665
Come along, David.

10
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:40,020
Come on there, Harry boy. It's time.
- That's the trouble with this world today.

11
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:42,313
Everyone is in
such a blooming hurry.

12
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:45,169
Goodnight, George.
- Goodnight. See you tommorow.

13
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:53,769
It's time, mate.
You'll have to drink up.

14
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:56,114
Now come on now.
- You heard me. We're closing.

15
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:01,706
You want to get rough-like,
do you? Come on.

16
00:03:15,164 --> 00:03:15,899
Chum.

17
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,884
You've been and
gone and done it.

18
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,339
He's dead.
You killed him.

19
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,609
Alright.

20
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,056
Stop him!

21
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,290
What did he do?

22
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,208
He killed the governor.
That's what he did.

23
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:56,761
Hey, what's going on here?

24
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,065
Did he pass you?
A big fellah running?

25
00:05:40,145 --> 00:05:42,275
No. Nobody passed me.
- He must have gone this way then.

26
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,092
Who is it? What do you want?

27
00:07:20,551 --> 00:07:23,274
We're looking for a man, missus.
He might be in one of these houses.

28
00:07:23,663 --> 00:07:24,850
He's not in this house.

29
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,144
I keep this house respectable, I do.
And no thanks to the Police, neither.

30
00:07:31,776 --> 00:07:34,196
You won't get hurt if you
keep quiet. Understand?

31
00:07:38,202 --> 00:07:39,647
You just try anything and I'll..

32
00:07:46,476 --> 00:07:48,234
Don't make a move and
keep your mouth shut.

33
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:03,382
Do you live alone?

34
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:34,269
There's no sense in standing there. You
might as well make yourself comfortable.

35
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,626
I'm staying for a while.
You'd better get used to the idea.

36
00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:56,474
There is nothing to be scared of.

37
00:08:57,076 --> 00:08:58,424
Then why are you scared?

38
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,498
Where do you think you're going?

39
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:41,123
Nowhere at the moment, but in
about an hour I've a job to go to.

40
00:09:42,229 --> 00:09:43,837
What makes you
think I'll let you go?

41
00:09:44,438 --> 00:09:46,598
If you don't they'll send
someone down to see if I'm ill.

42
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,251
Who is "they"?
- The Institution. - The What?

43
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:52,677
The Mary Wilson Institute.
I work in a clinic there.

44
00:10:00,473 --> 00:10:02,117
I watched you
while you were sleeping.

45
00:10:02,856 --> 00:10:03,671
You talked.

46
00:10:05,301 --> 00:10:06,231
What did I say?

47
00:10:07,396 --> 00:10:08,609
Nothing incriminating.

48
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,321
How about some coffee?

49
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:25,088
There is tea here if you want it.

50
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,093
The milk is outside the front door.

51
00:10:27,903 --> 00:10:29,062
We'll drink it without.

52
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,986
I don't like it without.

53
00:10:34,643 --> 00:10:35,544
I'll fetch it.

54
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,291
I have to go.

55
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,918
How come you didn't tell the Cops?

56
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:27,995
What time you get back?

57
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,158
About seven.

58
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,875
And I don't expect to find
you here when I do get back.

59
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,467
What if I am?

60
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:35,586
I hardly think you will be.

61
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:38,955
I'll stick around until it gets dark.

62
00:11:40,035 --> 00:11:41,625
Did you rob or kill someone?

63
00:11:44,492 --> 00:11:45,651
That's what they think.

64
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,970
I was in a bar, drinking alone.

65
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,611
A fight started.. somebody
got slugged and I ducked out.

66
00:11:51,657 --> 00:11:52,987
I'm new around here, you see.

67
00:11:53,827 --> 00:11:54,870
And they chased me.

68
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,277
You sure that's all?
- Sure that's all.

69
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:03,720
Just a minute.

70
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:06,322
Yes?

71
00:12:08,548 --> 00:12:09,277
Nothing.

72
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:12,463
You're a good kid.

73
00:12:17,846 --> 00:12:20,252
Good morning, dear.
- Good morning, Mrs Gale.

74
00:12:20,455 --> 00:12:23,140
Up early this morning, aren't you?
- I saw you going for the milk.

75
00:12:23,396 --> 00:12:24,900
We expect rather a busy day.

76
00:12:25,555 --> 00:12:27,836
Oh you needn't bother to do
my room. I've done it already.

77
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:29,425
Thank you, dear.

78
00:13:55,926 --> 00:13:57,514
Not a peep out of
you, you understand?

79
00:15:59,603 --> 00:16:01,460
Will it hurt?
- A little.

80
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:09,349
Will this make my ear better?
- Very soon. You'll see.

81
00:16:09,797 --> 00:16:11,513
Now.. take a deep breath.

82
00:16:14,478 --> 00:16:15,890
There.. that's all it is.

83
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:18,943
I didn't cry.
- I didn't think you would.

84
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:22,209
Next Monday, same time.
- Thank you so much, Miss.

85
00:16:22,843 --> 00:16:24,938
I'm sure your ear will
be better, Donald, so..

86
00:16:25,178 --> 00:16:28,050
Have a nice weekend, but no
rough play now. Not until next week.

87
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:29,657
Have a nice weekend yourself.

88
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,923
Thank you. Goodbye, Donald.
- Goodbye.

89
00:16:40,761 --> 00:16:41,433
Hello.

90
00:16:43,444 --> 00:16:44,816
Oh it's you.
Yeah.

91
00:16:45,836 --> 00:16:46,823
What do you want?

92
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:48,768
Nothing. I just
wanted to say hello.

93
00:16:49,831 --> 00:16:50,675
Then, hello.

94
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,776
Let's get this straightened
out. I don't run a hotel.

95
00:16:57,811 --> 00:16:59,809
I'm not looking for one.
- What are you looking for?

96
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:01,512
Nothing. I'm not looking for nothing.

97
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:03,225
Do I have to call the Police?

98
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:06,008
What for? I only want to talk to you.
- But I don't like your talking to me.

99
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,192
I don't like you walking
along with me, either.

100
00:17:08,302 --> 00:17:11,504
If I do call a Policeman, he may like to
know you forced your way in my room.

101
00:17:11,996 --> 00:17:13,775
And also the part you
played in that brawl.

102
00:17:14,073 --> 00:17:16,122
I told you what happened.
- A man was killed.

103
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,755
If you really want to know why
I ducked out, I'll tell you. I jumped ship.

104
00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:22,954
I wasn't going to wait around for any
Cops to pick me up. That's on the level.

105
00:17:23,382 --> 00:17:25,518
I just stopped by to say
hello. And give you this.

106
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:27,878
Thanks. I thought..

107
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:29,602
You thought I'd lifted it, huh?

108
00:17:29,802 --> 00:17:32,009
I don't go stealing stuff from
people that do me favours.

109
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:33,877
I just slipped it into
my pocket by mistake.

110
00:17:34,057 --> 00:17:35,015
Well, I'm sorry.

111
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:37,405
But, do you mind
if I say goodbye now.

112
00:18:18,762 --> 00:18:19,806
Must you follow me?

113
00:18:20,187 --> 00:18:21,718
Maybe I've got
nothing better to do.

114
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:25,749
Oh, cut it out will you. Do you have to
be sore all the time? I won't hurt you.

115
00:18:25,829 --> 00:18:27,900
Please leave me alone.
I don't know who you are.

116
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,360
What's the difference who I am?
I just want to talk to you.

117
00:18:30,968 --> 00:18:32,394
My name is Bill. Bill Saunders.

118
00:18:32,474 --> 00:18:34,948
That doesn't tell me very much.
- Alright, what do you want to know?

119
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:37,455
I was born in Canada, raised
in Detroit. - Why don't you go back?

120
00:18:37,925 --> 00:18:38,734
Go back?

121
00:18:39,614 --> 00:18:40,343
To what?

122
00:18:40,896 --> 00:18:41,997
Something. Someone.

123
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,704
There's nobody. Nothing.

124
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:01,917
You're pretty lonely yourself.

125
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:19,408
Come on. Let's get out of here.

126
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,364
What's the matter?
Haven't you seen a zoo before?

127
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:28,297
I've been in one all my life.

128
00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:30,437
I don't like to be
reminded of it. That's all.

129
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:32,269
You're shaking.

130
00:20:32,887 --> 00:20:34,503
I can't stand to see
anything caged up.

131
00:20:35,594 --> 00:20:37,209
Have you never
been behind barbed wire?

132
00:20:37,745 --> 00:20:38,503
Have you?

133
00:20:38,586 --> 00:20:40,279
Almost two years
in a Nazi prison camp.

134
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,779
Being shoved around by those..

135
00:20:43,554 --> 00:20:46,185
You think those monkeys are something?
You want to see men in cages.

136
00:20:50,304 --> 00:20:51,794
Do you want some.. peanuts?

137
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,469
Alright.

138
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,700
Your name is Jane?

139
00:21:11,496 --> 00:21:12,426
I saw the book.

140
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:13,819
Oh.

141
00:21:16,673 --> 00:21:17,716
Who is the Officer?

142
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,506
Who?
- The guy in the photo.

143
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:20,852
Oh.

144
00:21:21,982 --> 00:21:23,334
That's Loyd. He was killed.

145
00:21:25,872 --> 00:21:26,687
Tough luck.

146
00:21:31,837 --> 00:21:32,910
Did you get over it?

147
00:21:35,151 --> 00:21:36,334
Do you get over things?

148
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,351
Do you ever go to the races?

149
00:21:41,431 --> 00:21:43,308
Horse racing?
- Uhuh. - No, I don't.

150
00:21:43,388 --> 00:21:45,461
You ought to try it. You ought
to try everything once.

151
00:21:47,415 --> 00:21:48,888
Will you go with
me this Saturday?

152
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,718
I won't bother you
until then if you do.

153
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:54,667
You are very strange.

154
00:22:40,449 --> 00:22:41,645
Do you think we're late?

155
00:22:41,725 --> 00:22:43,447
I guess we've missed the
first race. It don't matter.

156
00:22:43,527 --> 00:22:44,970
It's the second race that counts.

157
00:22:47,194 --> 00:22:50,283
Don't think I've come down here from
London with the object of making money.

158
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:53,584
I ask you.. do I look
as if I needed money?

159
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,990
I come down here with
the sole and only purpose.

160
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:57,823
Of assisting you to return home.

161
00:22:58,153 --> 00:23:00,566
Lighter in heart,
but heavier in pocket.

162
00:23:01,141 --> 00:23:03,387
Each and every one of these
envelopes, ladies and gentlemen.

163
00:23:03,488 --> 00:23:05,103
Contains the winner
of the second race.

164
00:23:05,644 --> 00:23:08,286
Five shillings is the regular price
of the ordinary Doubting Thomas.

165
00:23:08,752 --> 00:23:10,197
But to you, ladies and gentlemen.

166
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,445
I will pass on this
red-hot information.

167
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:14,273
For just one paltry shilling.

168
00:23:14,682 --> 00:23:15,698
One shilling, sir.

169
00:23:16,131 --> 00:23:17,174
One, sir. One, sir.

170
00:23:17,544 --> 00:23:18,321
One, sir.

171
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,566
One, sir?

172
00:23:21,231 --> 00:23:21,846
One.

173
00:23:23,857 --> 00:23:24,787
How many, lady?

174
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:27,118
Just a bob.
Twelve miserable coppers.

175
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,167
Beat it. Save it for
the suckers. - No, please.

176
00:23:29,247 --> 00:23:31,393
Here you are. Thank you
very much. - Thank you, lady.

177
00:23:34,835 --> 00:23:36,729
2nd race.. "Sudden Cloud".

178
00:23:37,008 --> 00:23:38,831
Sudden Cloud. Sudden Cloud is..

179
00:23:39,191 --> 00:23:40,307
Thirty-five to one.

180
00:23:40,478 --> 00:23:42,752
Isn't that a good horse?
- Sure, if all the others drop dead.

181
00:23:43,263 --> 00:23:45,072
I know what's going to
win the 2nd race. - You do?

182
00:23:45,377 --> 00:23:46,650
"Dairy Maid". It's a cinch.

183
00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:49,022
How can you be so sure?
- I got it straight from the jockey.

184
00:23:49,102 --> 00:23:50,517
It's in the bag for Dairy Maid.

185
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:54,015
Anyway, I'm going to put a bet on Sudden
Cloud as it's such a wonderful name.

186
00:23:54,564 --> 00:23:56,533
What will I get if it wins?
- If it wins..

187
00:23:56,692 --> 00:23:59,579
You get 35 times what you put up.
- Oh, but that's too simple.

188
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,355
We'd better place our bets, then

189
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:02,670
Here, put this on it.

190
00:24:03,018 --> 00:24:06,134
You must be mad. A whole pound?
And I wouldn't take it from you.

191
00:24:06,464 --> 00:24:09,883
I wouldn't think of putting on more than
a shilling. I'm a working girl, you know.

192
00:24:10,403 --> 00:24:12,899
I would like to put a shilling
on Sudden Cloud, please.

193
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,829
35 to one lady.

194
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:19,666
He talked so fast I couldn't tell what
he said. But I suppose it's alright.

195
00:24:19,863 --> 00:24:20,907
Will it start soon?

196
00:24:29,305 --> 00:24:31,963
So which one is Sudden Cloud?
- Number six. Right there.

197
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:33,998
I can't see.
- She's six lengths behind.

198
00:24:34,258 --> 00:24:35,331
I can't see a thing.

199
00:24:41,224 --> 00:24:42,955
Come on, Sudden Cloud.
- Where is she now?

200
00:24:43,053 --> 00:24:45,098
I don't know. Which is it?
- It's the jockey in blue.

201
00:24:45,189 --> 00:24:46,324
Come on, Sudden Cloud.

202
00:24:50,854 --> 00:24:52,146
It's all over.
- Who won?

203
00:24:53,651 --> 00:24:54,523
I don't know.

204
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:56,073
Look up there. The number board.

205
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:02,163
She won!

206
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:05,346
I knew she would. That little man
knew what he was talking about.

207
00:25:06,093 --> 00:25:08,269
Oh, and your Dairy Maid.. I'm sorry.

208
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,329
Give me your tickets.
I'll collect for you.

209
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:11,687
Uhuh. That's half the fun.

210
00:25:11,955 --> 00:25:13,381
Okay, go ahead. I'll wait here.

211
00:25:21,714 --> 00:25:24,648
Hello, chum.. fancy meeting you.

212
00:25:27,991 --> 00:25:29,423
Afraid you've got the wrong guy.

213
00:25:29,503 --> 00:25:31,579
Now you've hurt my feelings.
Because I remember you.

214
00:25:31,982 --> 00:25:35,968
It does me good to see you walk about
as large as life and twice as handsome.

215
00:25:37,226 --> 00:25:39,200
And free. Free as air.

216
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:42,626
It's alright. The girl won't
be back for a minute.

217
00:25:42,969 --> 00:25:44,975
She's nice looking,
ain't she? Quite a lady.

218
00:25:45,355 --> 00:25:47,258
I told you I don't know you.
- Now take it easy.

219
00:25:47,537 --> 00:25:49,649
I'm not a Copper
and this ain't a touch.

220
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,769
So you've nothing to
worry about either way.

221
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,528
Get away from me.

222
00:25:53,798 --> 00:25:55,475
Alright, alright, alright.

223
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:58,403
And if you should ever need
a friend, there is always Harry.

224
00:25:59,078 --> 00:26:01,854
The day a pal of mine is in trouble,
that's the day I rise and shine.

225
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,685
Remember that.. a friend
in need is a friend indeed.

226
00:26:06,388 --> 00:26:07,260
Robbie Burns.

227
00:26:07,852 --> 00:26:08,881
Goodbye, chum.

228
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,249
Two more. Altogether, that's
42 shillings to the good.

229
00:26:21,484 --> 00:26:23,725
A fine afternoon's work.
- All that money! It's wicked.

230
00:26:23,805 --> 00:26:25,418
What do you want
to do? Give it back?

231
00:26:25,498 --> 00:26:27,575
Take you to tea and miss
the crowds on the train.

232
00:26:27,812 --> 00:26:29,715
Oh I didn't ask you.
How did you do? - I didn't.

233
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:30,753
Oh.

234
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:33,492
You come to the races often?
- Often enough. But never with a girl.

235
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:35,283
Oh, a likely story.

236
00:26:35,478 --> 00:26:36,980
Never with a girl
as lucky as you.

237
00:26:49,181 --> 00:26:50,711
I haven't had
a day like this for..

238
00:26:50,795 --> 00:26:51,752
For a long time.

239
00:26:52,055 --> 00:26:53,214
It's been fun.
- Good.

240
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:54,776
No, really. I mean it.

241
00:26:56,788 --> 00:26:57,513
Tired?

242
00:26:57,593 --> 00:26:59,580
Hmm. I'm completely done
over, but it was worth it.

243
00:27:01,852 --> 00:27:03,870
You got a family?
- Nah. - Nobody?

244
00:27:04,655 --> 00:27:06,186
Well, at least
we're alike that way.

245
00:27:07,482 --> 00:27:10,415
You're educated. Anybody
can see that. - Oh, can they?

246
00:27:11,493 --> 00:27:12,938
I never got past the sixth grade.

247
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:17,002
What goes with you?

248
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:19,301
Oh, with me?

249
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:21,859
Well, I was a proper little girl.

250
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:24,236
Seen but not heard. Never
caused anybody any trouble.

251
00:27:24,316 --> 00:27:26,744
Didn't help very much, did it?
They kicked your teeth in anyway.

252
00:27:26,824 --> 00:27:27,896
The RAF guy, I mean.

253
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:30,809
But I wasn't the only one.

254
00:27:33,056 --> 00:27:34,901
What kind of a job have
you got at that place?

255
00:27:35,492 --> 00:27:36,145
Oh.

256
00:27:36,918 --> 00:27:39,176
I'm sort of...
assistant to everybody.

257
00:27:39,377 --> 00:27:41,298
Like it?
- Hmm. Love it. I feel useful.

258
00:27:42,907 --> 00:27:44,170
It is not a bad feeling.

259
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,675
Cigarette?

260
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:52,782
It isn't a smoker.
- Oh.

261
00:27:53,181 --> 00:27:54,053
But go ahead.

262
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:55,638
Alright.

263
00:28:22,511 --> 00:28:25,613
You and me is always bumping into each
other. Ha.. must be in our horoscopes.

264
00:28:27,214 --> 00:28:28,172
A good sign, eh?

265
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:31,588
Your young lady friend seems a bit
keen on you. Anyone can see that.

266
00:28:32,122 --> 00:28:34,139
But then of course,
you're the sort they all go for.

267
00:28:34,258 --> 00:28:35,331
Flappers and ladies.

268
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:36,831
I said "lady".

269
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:39,831
Confidentially, I saw you
counting your money just now.

270
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,793
It wasn't much of a count, was it.

271
00:28:42,002 --> 00:28:42,903
No. It wasn't.

272
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,826
You know, I took a shine to
you the first time I seen you.

273
00:28:46,322 --> 00:28:47,795
That night in the pub.
- Shut up.

274
00:28:47,974 --> 00:28:49,018
Can you imagine..?

275
00:28:49,555 --> 00:28:51,476
I can't even remember
the name of it now.

276
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:53,878
Here.

277
00:28:54,617 --> 00:28:56,434
There is a certain
proposition I've heard of.

278
00:28:58,207 --> 00:28:59,134
A proposition?

279
00:28:59,214 --> 00:29:01,745
Oh, just a little business venture
of mine. I could do with a partner.

280
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,279
A young man. Strong, courageous.
Handy with his fists.

281
00:29:05,361 --> 00:29:06,577
There's fifty quid in it.

282
00:29:08,203 --> 00:29:10,123
Nothing doing.
- Reformed, eh?

283
00:29:10,641 --> 00:29:12,795
Stop blocking the corridor, please.

284
00:29:14,323 --> 00:29:15,110
Look here.

285
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:17,528
If you want to
impress the young lady.

286
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:20,638
Don't forget that sort
of thing takes money.

287
00:29:28,896 --> 00:29:30,472
No objection if I sit here?

288
00:29:34,323 --> 00:29:36,512
Mind if I put up my feet?
- No. Not at all.

289
00:29:36,992 --> 00:29:39,642
Oh that's better. I've
been on my feet all day.

290
00:29:40,618 --> 00:29:42,723
I mustn't grumble though.
I've had a very good day.

291
00:29:43,205 --> 00:29:48,017
I'm in artificial fuel. Thermal-Cake.
It looks like coal, burns like coal.

292
00:29:48,183 --> 00:29:51,048
Lasts longer. Smells better.
Ever tried it, Miss?

293
00:29:51,461 --> 00:29:52,999
No, I don't believe I have.

294
00:29:54,571 --> 00:29:55,215
Well.

295
00:29:55,788 --> 00:29:57,843
In case you should
ever want any, here.

296
00:30:01,283 --> 00:30:02,527
Are you together?
- Yeah.

297
00:30:16,404 --> 00:30:19,197
I don't know what I'd do
without the devil's picture-books.

298
00:30:20,015 --> 00:30:21,394
Travelling about like this.

299
00:30:22,498 --> 00:30:24,479
A fellow has got to
keep his mind occupied.

300
00:30:26,135 --> 00:30:27,122
Like card tricks?

301
00:30:30,364 --> 00:30:31,197
You, Miss?

302
00:30:31,648 --> 00:30:32,641
Not particularly.

303
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:36,062
Here's one I bet you never saw.
Take a card. Any card.

304
00:30:38,896 --> 00:30:40,733
Now look at it.
Don't show it to me.

305
00:30:41,062 --> 00:30:42,914
Now put it back.
Remember what it was.

306
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,100
Got it?

307
00:30:47,499 --> 00:30:48,629
Two of diamonds. What?

308
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,011
That's very good.

309
00:30:50,198 --> 00:30:51,357
Have you seen this one?

310
00:30:56,887 --> 00:30:58,189
King, Queen, Jack of spades.

311
00:31:02,518 --> 00:31:03,677
Which one is the Queen?

312
00:31:07,591 --> 00:31:09,312
Oh.. that's good, Bill.

313
00:31:09,641 --> 00:31:12,064
Sleight of hand. Deceives the
eye and all that you know.

314
00:31:12,518 --> 00:31:13,534
Take another card.

315
00:31:20,382 --> 00:31:22,895
No, no, no.
There is your Queen.

316
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,307
Not bad.

317
00:31:26,282 --> 00:31:28,828
I've a natural eye. Probably
from doing tricks myself.

318
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,403
I still think I can fool you.

319
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:34,216
I doubt it. I doubt it.

320
00:31:34,577 --> 00:31:35,446
Want to try?

321
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,717
Don't care if I do. But I'm
warning you, though.

322
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:39,985
Cover that.

323
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:41,929
Well.

324
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:44,354
Well.

325
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:46,313
I don't mind if I do.

326
00:31:51,068 --> 00:31:51,826
That one.

327
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:54,992
Say, you are quick.

328
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,656
That's me, alright.

329
00:31:57,741 --> 00:31:59,835
I bet I can still fool you.
Try again, double.

330
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,595
Not for me.

331
00:32:08,103 --> 00:32:09,319
I said try again. Double.

332
00:32:10,046 --> 00:32:12,031
I said no. Clear, isn't it?

333
00:32:13,946 --> 00:32:15,047
Come on. Pick a card.

334
00:32:15,415 --> 00:32:16,574
What do you think I am?

335
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,505
I wasn't born in the world to be
cheated by an incompetent card-sharp.

336
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:21,789
You'd better play!

337
00:32:22,046 --> 00:32:22,730
Bill.

338
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:25,777
And you'd better take some more
lessons, my fine feathered friend.

339
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,176
Bill, don't!

340
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:28,891
Help.. help!

341
00:32:48,122 --> 00:32:49,448
Take your hands off me!

342
00:32:50,214 --> 00:32:53,091
You shouldn't have pulled the cord. We'd
have been right if you'd kept your head.

343
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,816
Come on.
I'm not going with you.

344
00:32:55,322 --> 00:32:56,338
What's the matter?

345
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:59,174
Him? He was no good. Did you
see the way he looked at you?

346
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,122
I don't ever want
to see you again.

347
00:33:11,655 --> 00:33:12,641
Listen, will you.

348
00:33:12,721 --> 00:33:14,660
I didn't do it just for the
sake of it. I had to.

349
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,869
One of me, one of him.

350
00:33:16,213 --> 00:33:18,546
He had a nice time of..
- I was out of my mind to go with you.

351
00:33:18,626 --> 00:33:19,648
Have a nice time?

352
00:33:19,728 --> 00:33:21,518
Yes, I thought I was
wrong about you, but..

353
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:24,568
Now I see you as you really are.
You are everything bad.

354
00:33:25,217 --> 00:33:26,432
I never did you any harm.

355
00:33:26,749 --> 00:33:27,606
Didn't you?

356
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,314
Jane.

357
00:33:31,138 --> 00:33:32,900
Will you please let me go.
- Listen to me.

358
00:33:33,977 --> 00:33:36,509
There is nobody else I want to be with.
Nobody else I want to talk to.

359
00:33:37,293 --> 00:33:38,452
What's wrong with that?

360
00:33:38,555 --> 00:33:40,852
I'll tell you what's wrong.
You're wrong. You are a coward.

361
00:33:41,126 --> 00:33:42,657
There was one of
him and one of you.

362
00:33:42,783 --> 00:33:46,178
He was an older man. I suppose if you'd
hit a child, you'd say the same thing.

363
00:33:46,621 --> 00:33:49,855
What's the matter with you? Why can't
you be decent like everybody else?

364
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,720
You're nothing but a
cheap, vicious bully.

365
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,767
Jane.. Jane!

366
00:33:56,362 --> 00:33:58,600
Come on now. Let's
leave this young lady be.

367
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:13,339
William Earle Saunders.

368
00:34:13,848 --> 00:34:16,882
You have been found guilty
on two serious counts.

369
00:34:17,368 --> 00:34:20,290
The first, robbery with
violence against one..

370
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:21,661
Thomas Widgery.

371
00:34:22,337 --> 00:34:24,950
The second, a savage and
unprovoked attack..

372
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:28,028
Against an Officer of the law in
the execution of his duties.

373
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,282
Have you anything to
say in your defence?

374
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:31,761
No.

375
00:34:32,818 --> 00:34:35,393
I then sentence you,
William Earle Saunders.

376
00:34:35,789 --> 00:34:38,194
To six months hard
labour on each count.

377
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:40,262
Sentences to run concurrently.

378
00:34:40,884 --> 00:34:41,771
Furthermore.

379
00:34:42,135 --> 00:34:44,112
Although these appear
to be first offenses.

380
00:34:44,838 --> 00:34:46,990
In view of the brutal
nature of the assaults.

381
00:34:47,447 --> 00:34:48,859
I have no alternative.

382
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:53,387
But to direct that you receive
eighteen strokes of the cat-of-nine-tails.

383
00:35:54,423 --> 00:35:55,009
Go.

384
00:35:59,007 --> 00:35:59,593
Go.

385
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,598
Go.

386
00:36:05,718 --> 00:36:06,475
Go.

387
00:37:13,307 --> 00:37:14,293
This table taken?

388
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:15,710
Help yourself.

389
00:37:36,884 --> 00:37:38,205
Waiting for someone, mate?

390
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,506
Care to run a few?

391
00:37:42,148 --> 00:37:42,779
No.

392
00:37:43,432 --> 00:37:44,709
Just for sport, mate.

393
00:37:47,091 --> 00:37:47,852
Yeah.

394
00:37:57,448 --> 00:38:00,744
Just a wee bit more English,
as they say.. eh, Chum?

395
00:38:05,652 --> 00:38:07,038
You sure get around, don't you.

396
00:38:07,695 --> 00:38:09,844
How are you feeling after
your little vacation, eh?

397
00:38:10,616 --> 00:38:12,107
Great.
I'm happy to hear that.

398
00:38:12,287 --> 00:38:13,218
Truly I am.

399
00:38:13,578 --> 00:38:16,380
You know, you've been popping in and
out of my thoughts like a blooming rabbit.

400
00:38:16,846 --> 00:38:18,280
Here, George.
Come over here.

401
00:38:19,076 --> 00:38:20,984
How about a little game
of snooker on me, eh?

402
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:23,407
Here, set them up,
my little cock-sparrow.

403
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:29,733
How you fixed?
Got anything in view?

404
00:38:30,192 --> 00:38:32,014
A nice, pleasing situation?

405
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:34,889
Fixing to blow soon.
Get out of town.

406
00:38:34,969 --> 00:38:36,884
Naturally, you have
all my sympathies.

407
00:38:37,507 --> 00:38:39,152
A man that's gone
through what you have.

408
00:38:39,868 --> 00:38:42,741
But you should need a bit of the
old readies to move around on.

409
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,467
How you placed that way?

410
00:38:44,853 --> 00:38:45,697
I'll get by.

411
00:38:45,777 --> 00:38:47,781
Of course you will.
Of course you will.

412
00:38:48,254 --> 00:38:50,577
Why, you're a man who
would get by wherever you are.

413
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,655
But if you should need a little..

414
00:38:53,027 --> 00:38:54,954
Extra spondulix.

415
00:38:55,508 --> 00:38:57,525
Just to tide you over,
sort of get you on your feet.

416
00:38:57,886 --> 00:38:58,987
I don't need a thing.

417
00:38:59,298 --> 00:39:01,056
Here, now that ain't
exactly true you know.

418
00:39:01,545 --> 00:39:03,279
We all need a bit
more than we've got.

419
00:39:04,589 --> 00:39:07,863
But you mustn't let your temper
get the better of your judgment.

420
00:39:08,494 --> 00:39:10,272
That's been many
a good man's downfall.

421
00:39:11,798 --> 00:39:13,872
Look before you.. hit.

422
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:16,282
That's what I always say.

423
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,790
Come on, come on.
What's on your mind? Spill it.

424
00:39:19,006 --> 00:39:20,807
Ah you see, now
you're being reasonable.

425
00:39:22,516 --> 00:39:23,209
Here.

426
00:39:23,992 --> 00:39:25,127
Get yourself a cup.

427
00:39:29,549 --> 00:39:30,872
You know, it seems to me..

428
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:34,443
That there are too many people walking
about these days who can afford to ride.

429
00:39:35,412 --> 00:39:36,816
Given the opportunity.

430
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:41,835
I don't get you.
- Here, just a minute.

431
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,038
Have you ever stopped to
think about petrol coupons?

432
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:52,567
There is a tidy little sum in it,
if you know how to handle them.

433
00:39:53,077 --> 00:39:55,599
Yeah. And there's a tidy little stretch
in the pen if you get caught.

434
00:39:55,669 --> 00:39:57,662
Well of course, if you've got
something better in view.

435
00:39:58,433 --> 00:40:01,236
Like a job in an office or
behind the bars in a bank.

436
00:40:02,144 --> 00:40:04,180
Something nice and cosy.

437
00:40:05,563 --> 00:40:06,740
You know what I've got.

438
00:40:09,355 --> 00:40:10,483
Suppose it is a deal.

439
00:40:11,267 --> 00:40:14,825
Oh.. I've been waiting a long
time to hear you say that.

440
00:40:15,471 --> 00:40:17,515
Patience and luck.
That's my motto.

441
00:40:18,087 --> 00:40:19,303
That's got me where I am.

442
00:40:19,815 --> 00:40:22,276
You and me could have a
rare partnership together.

443
00:40:23,232 --> 00:40:24,534
Now let's get this straight.

444
00:40:25,227 --> 00:40:28,052
All I want is a one shot deal
for a bankroll and then I blow.

445
00:40:28,646 --> 00:40:31,181
You can find me at
number 7 Markwell Place.

446
00:40:32,956 --> 00:40:33,628
Seven.

447
00:40:34,152 --> 00:40:35,498
That's a lucky number, that is.

448
00:40:55,266 --> 00:40:56,110
Hello, Bill.

449
00:40:58,343 --> 00:41:00,985
I tried to find what day
you were coming out.

450
00:41:03,068 --> 00:41:03,797
You did?

451
00:41:04,066 --> 00:41:06,585
Yes, but it seems you have
to be a relative or something.

452
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:11,368
I thought you
had forgotten about me.

453
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,310
I thought a lot about you.

454
00:41:15,747 --> 00:41:16,474
Yeah.

455
00:41:17,286 --> 00:41:18,874
I thought how
wrong it was that you..

456
00:41:18,964 --> 00:41:20,666
You ever got mixed
up with a guy like me.

457
00:41:22,582 --> 00:41:24,341
I guess we didn't make
much sense together.

458
00:41:26,225 --> 00:41:27,585
It is very close this evening.

459
00:41:29,727 --> 00:41:30,800
It seems fine to me.

460
00:41:31,714 --> 00:41:32,901
I guess any place would.

461
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:35,065
Six months in there is..

462
00:41:35,757 --> 00:41:36,916
It's like a whole life.

463
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:38,107
Good evening.

464
00:41:38,402 --> 00:41:39,721
Good evening, Mrs Gale.

465
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,024
Cigarette?
- No thank you.

466
00:41:47,997 --> 00:41:49,213
What have you been doing?

467
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:53,391
I had dinner with a girlfriend
and we went to the pictures.

468
00:41:54,952 --> 00:41:56,499
Every night?
- No.

469
00:42:01,206 --> 00:42:02,622
The building is almost finished.

470
00:42:03,397 --> 00:42:04,892
Yes, it's been a long time,

471
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,779
What are you going to do?

472
00:42:11,485 --> 00:42:12,672
Get some money together.

473
00:42:13,288 --> 00:42:14,017
Beat it.

474
00:42:14,511 --> 00:42:16,065
Beat it, where?
- Oh, I don't know.

475
00:42:16,509 --> 00:42:17,811
Canada maybe. Some place.

476
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:19,898
Make a new start.

477
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,830
They need a lorry
driver at the Institute.

478
00:42:23,186 --> 00:42:25,251
I could talk to Dr Travis
in the morning.

479
00:42:26,105 --> 00:42:26,720
You?

480
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:28,525
You can drive, can't you?

481
00:42:29,058 --> 00:42:30,520
Yeah.. but why?

482
00:42:31,352 --> 00:42:33,541
You would be out in the open
most of the time on your own.

483
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,260
Wouldn't you like
that sort of a job?

484
00:42:37,059 --> 00:42:38,618
I don't know why
you want to do this.

485
00:42:40,073 --> 00:42:41,603
What are you going
to them about me?

486
00:42:41,686 --> 00:42:42,816
About where I've been.

487
00:42:43,748 --> 00:42:45,565
The truth, and that you
are a friend of mine.

488
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,723
It's been nice seeing you, Bill.

489
00:42:47,938 --> 00:42:48,725
Goodnight.

490
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:50,965
Goodnight.

491
00:43:09,191 --> 00:43:11,328
It sounds a little rough.
You'd better lean it up a bit.

492
00:43:11,408 --> 00:43:12,394
Yeah, it needs..

493
00:43:13,263 --> 00:43:14,507
What do you know about it?

494
00:43:14,709 --> 00:43:17,120
I drove an ambulance for four
years in the Fire Service.

495
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:21,614
You should have seen me. Trousers,
battle jacket, great heavy boots.

496
00:43:22,644 --> 00:43:23,712
And my language.

497
00:43:51,864 --> 00:43:53,107
How you blowing, chum?

498
00:43:54,787 --> 00:43:57,119
What are you doing here?
- Keeping you pretty busy, ain't they.

499
00:43:57,442 --> 00:43:58,836
I see you're working overtime.

500
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:00,957
Who told you?
- It's up on the board there.

501
00:44:01,644 --> 00:44:03,127
Leaving for Evesham at 8 o'clock.

502
00:44:04,637 --> 00:44:06,745
A tidy little run, eh?
- Listen, I'm busy.

503
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,909
All manner of things,
you're tucking away in there.

504
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:11,850
A marvellous assortment.

505
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,741
Penicillin and sulphur
drugs and who knows what.

506
00:44:16,215 --> 00:44:18,535
Here.. it's as plain as
the nose on your face.

507
00:44:19,335 --> 00:44:20,985
Here is your one-shot deal right here.

508
00:44:21,249 --> 00:44:22,693
And Harry knows how to handle it.

509
00:44:23,715 --> 00:44:24,559
You do, huh?

510
00:44:24,801 --> 00:44:27,333
Of course, we couldn't pull it off
over here. But on the continent..?

511
00:44:27,428 --> 00:44:28,928
You know what it's like over there.

512
00:44:29,008 --> 00:44:29,880
Human misery.

513
00:44:30,241 --> 00:44:32,219
And do you know what goes
with misery? Suffering.

514
00:44:32,797 --> 00:44:34,127
And what goes with suffering?

515
00:44:34,898 --> 00:44:35,685
A fortune.

516
00:44:35,765 --> 00:44:37,793
You're nuts. You'd never
get it out of the country.

517
00:44:37,873 --> 00:44:39,948
I'd get it through the gates
of heaven if I had to.

518
00:44:40,662 --> 00:44:41,791
I've got a connection.

519
00:44:42,209 --> 00:44:43,589
The Skipper of the Pelicano.

520
00:44:44,526 --> 00:44:45,815
Just arrived off Gravesend.

521
00:44:46,469 --> 00:44:47,341
He'd take it.

522
00:44:47,902 --> 00:44:48,889
And you, too.

523
00:44:51,739 --> 00:44:53,157
I'm doing alright where I am.

524
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:55,424
Do you know, I can't
understand you, chum.

525
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,750
You seem to have
forgotten something.

526
00:44:58,474 --> 00:45:00,245
Remember what's
hanging over your head.

527
00:45:08,173 --> 00:45:10,114
You took a long time
getting around to that.

528
00:45:10,475 --> 00:45:13,609
And don't forget I wasn't the only one
in the Anchor & Dolphin that night.

529
00:45:14,342 --> 00:45:15,746
You'd better see things my way.

530
00:45:16,636 --> 00:45:18,994
Why, with this under your belt,
you'll be sitting pretty.

531
00:45:19,434 --> 00:45:21,528
Out of the country.
Your pockets lined.

532
00:45:22,095 --> 00:45:23,634
And cocking a snook at the world.

533
00:45:24,387 --> 00:45:29,263
No Harry to remind you of a thing that
happened once in the heat of the moment.

534
00:45:29,831 --> 00:45:30,446
See?

535
00:45:42,389 --> 00:45:43,785
Now take it easy, chum.

536
00:45:44,686 --> 00:45:48,254
Old Harry may not have the muscle on him
but he has what it takes just the same.

537
00:45:49,584 --> 00:45:51,315
What would happen if I
phoned the Coppers?

538
00:45:52,284 --> 00:45:53,671
They'd hang you, wouldn't they.

539
00:45:54,274 --> 00:45:55,055
Hang you.

540
00:45:57,089 --> 00:45:59,937
But of course if you want to stick to
your job we can arrange that, too.

541
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:02,501
We'll make you look
a picture of innocence.

542
00:46:03,405 --> 00:46:04,358
Stop the truck.

543
00:46:04,786 --> 00:46:07,603
Beat you up proper scientific,
and no-one would be any the wiser.

544
00:46:08,527 --> 00:46:10,863
And you can trust me to see
that you get your money.

545
00:46:11,004 --> 00:46:12,163
I don't want any money.

546
00:46:15,071 --> 00:46:17,325
Alright.. I'll let you pull this off.

547
00:46:17,998 --> 00:46:19,643
That will square us.
You'll be paid off.

548
00:46:21,077 --> 00:46:22,950
But if you ever bother
me again, I'll kill you.

549
00:46:23,476 --> 00:46:25,264
You know, you're
cheapening yourself, chum.

550
00:46:25,643 --> 00:46:28,146
Of course, if that's the way you want it.
- That's the way I want it.

551
00:46:29,143 --> 00:46:31,074
The last thing you're ever
going to want from me.

552
00:46:31,276 --> 00:46:33,207
You'll be taking the
Blackwall Tunnel, won't you?

553
00:46:33,759 --> 00:46:36,091
I'll be waiting outside
the entrance at 8:30.

554
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,347
I'll bring a couple of
the lads along with me.

555
00:46:38,722 --> 00:46:41,746
They'll leave you looking as though
a blooming train ran right over you.

556
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:43,933
No real harm done.

557
00:46:45,466 --> 00:46:46,954
You know, their skill..

558
00:46:47,557 --> 00:46:49,153
Amazes me, sometimes.

559
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:52,378
Look here.

560
00:46:53,384 --> 00:46:54,571
This is important to me.

561
00:46:55,207 --> 00:46:57,380
So don't play no tricks on Harry.

562
00:47:03,691 --> 00:47:06,076
After you leave the Blackwall tunnel,
take the Maidstone road.

563
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,836
You'll have no trouble finding Evesham.

564
00:47:08,213 --> 00:47:11,500
I hope they can stop this scarlet fever
before it becomes an epidemic.

565
00:47:12,187 --> 00:47:13,606
I'm sorry about this.

566
00:47:13,921 --> 00:47:16,789
I know you've had some long hours
recently, but we'll make it up to you.

567
00:47:17,137 --> 00:47:19,333
Take tomorrow off.
- Thanks.

568
00:47:43,825 --> 00:47:46,622
Hello driver. Hurry and
come in out of the rain.

569
00:47:50,059 --> 00:47:51,933
It's a horrid night for a long drive.

570
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:53,042
I don't mind.

571
00:47:53,512 --> 00:47:55,000
Want a lift? Drop you home?

572
00:47:55,635 --> 00:47:56,794
No. I'm going with you.

573
00:47:58,139 --> 00:48:01,610
But.. I thought you'd be pleased.
They're short of staff in Evesham so..

574
00:48:02,168 --> 00:48:03,068
I volunteered.

575
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:05,924
They.. they could have sent someone
else. You've been working all day.

576
00:48:07,146 --> 00:48:08,795
Don't you want
me to go with you?

577
00:48:09,099 --> 00:48:10,138
Sure. Sure I do.

578
00:48:11,743 --> 00:48:14,215
Is anything the matter, Bill?
- No.. no.

579
00:48:14,907 --> 00:48:16,151
We'd better get started.

580
00:48:28,773 --> 00:48:31,435
You are becoming quite a popular
character around the institute.

581
00:48:32,569 --> 00:48:34,824
Am I?
- Yes. Everyone likes you.

582
00:48:38,675 --> 00:48:40,263
Not getting tired
of your job are you?

583
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:41,591
No. I like it.

584
00:48:42,484 --> 00:48:44,432
I thought you did.
You seemed happy.

585
00:48:47,285 --> 00:48:48,375
Not just the job.

586
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,101
You've never been around
Evesham before have you.

587
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,041
No. What's it like?
- Oh, it's beautiful down there.

588
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:02,974
I guess we won't see much of it.

589
00:49:04,419 --> 00:49:05,320
Here he comes.

590
00:49:14,571 --> 00:49:16,536
That man signalled us.
He seems to be in trouble.

591
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,723
Yeah. He did.

592
00:49:18,926 --> 00:49:20,085
I'll see what he wants.

593
00:49:24,723 --> 00:49:25,624
You wait here.

594
00:49:40,771 --> 00:49:43,477
You had me scared for a minute.
Sailing by like that.

595
00:49:43,905 --> 00:49:45,110
You splashed me, too.

596
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,839
Are these your friends?

597
00:49:46,919 --> 00:49:48,294
Felix, this is Mr Saunders.

598
00:49:48,481 --> 00:49:50,239
Pleased to meet you.
- And this is Charlie.

599
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:52,264
Didn't I see someone
with you in the lorry?

600
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:53,203
Yeah.

601
00:49:53,467 --> 00:49:55,601
We're not going through
with it tonight. - What's that?

602
00:49:55,681 --> 00:49:57,948
I didn't know she'd be coming along.
They needed extra help.

603
00:49:58,103 --> 00:49:59,668
"She"? You mean
the same young lady?

604
00:49:59,828 --> 00:50:01,788
I'll be carrying another
load one of these days.

605
00:50:01,868 --> 00:50:02,990
One of these days.

606
00:50:03,561 --> 00:50:06,024
The Skipper of the
Pelicano is ready tonight.

607
00:50:08,731 --> 00:50:10,097
The Skipper will have to wait.

608
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,218
We'll have to rough up
the young lady, too.

609
00:50:12,861 --> 00:50:15,293
Unless you leave her behind
and come along with me.

610
00:50:17,804 --> 00:50:18,991
I said it's off tonight.

611
00:50:59,415 --> 00:51:00,131
Bill!

612
00:51:01,648 --> 00:51:04,629
Oh, there you are! You were
so long and I began to worry.

613
00:51:05,536 --> 00:51:08,078
What happened?
- Nothing. The fellow lost his way.

614
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,306
Had to set him straight.

615
00:51:26,148 --> 00:51:28,251
You know what you've got to
do when you get to Evesham?

616
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:32,142
There's a Dr Paton waiting for us. We'll
likely cope with the new cases tonight.

617
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,124
And do preventative
inoculations in the morning.

618
00:51:34,728 --> 00:51:36,458
You're not going to get
much rest are you.

619
00:51:37,051 --> 00:51:38,009
Neither are you.

620
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:52,518
Nobody thought it would spread so quick,
but the penicillin will stop it, surely.

621
00:51:52,801 --> 00:51:53,616
Can't miss.

622
00:51:53,697 --> 00:51:56,644
That's very reassuring. Believe me.
When it's your own child.

623
00:51:56,944 --> 00:51:58,818
You've got nothing to
worry about. - Thank you.

624
00:51:58,932 --> 00:52:00,005
Thank you very much.

625
00:52:00,245 --> 00:52:02,813
I don't know what Dr Paton is going
to do about that Thomas girl.

626
00:52:03,077 --> 00:52:05,895
She was the first to come down with the
fever and the doctor can't get near her.

627
00:52:05,995 --> 00:52:08,351
What's the trouble?
- It's her father, Luther Thomas.

628
00:52:08,698 --> 00:52:11,641
They lost their first to diphtheria. He
thinks it's the inoculations that did it.

629
00:52:11,721 --> 00:52:12,808
Why, that's crazy.

630
00:52:12,888 --> 00:52:14,904
Thomas is a good man but
he won't listen to anybody.

631
00:52:15,134 --> 00:52:16,648
He won't let the
doctor near the girl.

632
00:52:16,728 --> 00:52:18,684
Constable, you're
wanted on the telephone.

633
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:29,523
Hello?

634
00:52:34,556 --> 00:52:35,298
I see.

635
00:52:36,334 --> 00:52:37,005
Right.

636
00:52:37,739 --> 00:52:39,928
Is that all there is to go, Bill?
- This is the last load.

637
00:52:40,253 --> 00:52:43,386
Dr Paton has given us a long list of
houses. We've a long, busy night ahead.

638
00:52:43,812 --> 00:52:45,609
Mrs Paton is going along
to show us the way.

639
00:52:46,187 --> 00:52:48,690
It sounds to me as if the young fellows
had a drop too much to drink.

640
00:52:48,913 --> 00:52:50,757
Put his head under the
pump and send him home.

641
00:53:08,663 --> 00:53:10,927
This one over here.
Number seven.

642
00:53:17,094 --> 00:53:19,445
Mr Thomas was quite violent
the last time the doctor called.

643
00:53:23,038 --> 00:53:24,039
What do you want?

644
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:26,075
Mr Thomas, this young
lady is from London.

645
00:53:26,337 --> 00:53:28,755
We don't want to see anybody.
- Can't I speak to you for a moment?

646
00:53:29,905 --> 00:53:31,234
I'm not listening to anybody.

647
00:53:31,823 --> 00:53:34,171
My little girl is going to get
better without any of your help.

648
00:53:34,528 --> 00:53:35,944
Get out!
- Now look, Mr Thomas.

649
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,855
You too. Get out!
- Don't you think..?

650
00:53:43,935 --> 00:53:45,458
Now listen.
- Leave us alone!

651
00:53:55,016 --> 00:53:55,946
We're going in.

652
00:53:58,917 --> 00:54:00,018
Now you listen to me.

653
00:54:01,673 --> 00:54:04,858
I've seen this stuff work on hundreds
of kids. For all kinds of things.

654
00:54:06,141 --> 00:54:07,414
It will only take a minute.

655
00:54:08,877 --> 00:54:11,243
If anything happens to your
little girl, it will be your fault.

656
00:54:15,802 --> 00:54:16,732
Go on in, Jane.

657
00:54:33,268 --> 00:54:35,325
Are you rushing back for
any special reason, Bill?

658
00:54:36,324 --> 00:54:37,758
Huh.. no, I..

659
00:54:39,179 --> 00:54:41,553
I should think you'd be in a hurry
to get home. Get some sleep.

660
00:54:41,633 --> 00:54:44,311
No, I'm not the least bit tired.
In fact, I've never felt so wide awake.

661
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:46,278
Hard work does that sometimes.

662
00:54:48,024 --> 00:54:49,672
Oh, did you ever
see anything so lovely?

663
00:54:51,841 --> 00:54:53,543
We do have the rest
of the day off, Bill.

664
00:54:55,033 --> 00:54:56,592
There is some
place you'd like to go?

665
00:54:57,047 --> 00:54:59,012
No, I'd just like to stop
and look for a while.

666
00:55:55,063 --> 00:55:56,050
I love you, Jane.

667
00:55:56,732 --> 00:55:58,992
You don't know how much I love you.
- Oh, I do. I do.

668
00:56:00,405 --> 00:56:02,934
I loved you for a long
time without knowing it.

669
00:56:03,254 --> 00:56:06,094
It's just that something kept
me from thinking the same.

670
00:56:09,041 --> 00:56:09,852
Jane.

671
00:56:11,406 --> 00:56:13,330
Not falling asleep, are you?
- Hmm.

672
00:56:14,431 --> 00:56:15,332
Just dreaming.

673
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:17,168
About us?

674
00:56:18,181 --> 00:56:19,654
I wish we could stay here forever.

675
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:21,340
A sort-of forever, anyway.

676
00:56:21,595 --> 00:56:22,696
I'll settle for that.

677
00:56:25,593 --> 00:56:26,885
It's getting kind of cool.

678
00:56:30,069 --> 00:56:31,169
Don't leave me, Bill.

679
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:32,974
Because you're afraid.

680
00:56:33,335 --> 00:56:34,814
Afraid? Afraid of what?

681
00:56:36,262 --> 00:56:37,997
That you were
thinking of going away.

682
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:41,796
All through our drive to Evesham, I..

683
00:56:42,584 --> 00:56:44,093
I was almost sorry I'd come along.

684
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:46,157
Then this morning I..

685
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,751
That's why I wanted to stop. To tell
you how much you meant to me and..

686
00:56:51,317 --> 00:56:53,857
How you've made me begin
to think of other things.

687
00:56:54,556 --> 00:56:55,971
Just the things I had lost.

688
00:56:58,407 --> 00:56:59,774
I was thinking of going away,

689
00:57:03,906 --> 00:57:05,235
Is anything the matter, Bill?

690
00:57:06,408 --> 00:57:07,297
No, it's..

691
00:57:08,056 --> 00:57:09,100
It's just that I..

692
00:57:11,222 --> 00:57:12,807
I've got no place in your life.

693
00:57:13,156 --> 00:57:14,601
I don't want to make you unhappy.

694
00:57:15,934 --> 00:57:16,791
You won't.

695
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,119
Would you go anywhere with me?

696
00:57:21,588 --> 00:57:24,113
Yes, but we're
doing what we like now.

697
00:57:24,655 --> 00:57:25,901
We'll always be together.

698
00:57:26,661 --> 00:57:27,934
Where would you want to go?

699
00:57:30,728 --> 00:57:31,743
I don't know. I..

700
00:57:35,912 --> 00:57:38,145
I don't want to go anywhere.
I just want to be with you.

701
00:58:01,768 --> 00:58:02,440
Harry.

702
00:58:05,472 --> 00:58:06,163
Harry!

703
00:58:37,224 --> 00:58:38,171
Yes?

704
00:58:49,227 --> 00:58:53,022
I hope you'll pardon this intrusion,
but I'm a friend. A friend of Bill's.

705
00:58:54,426 --> 00:58:56,375
Oh.. won't you come in?

706
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:58,602
Are you sure I'm not intruding?

707
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,829
No, not at all. Please sit down.

708
00:59:02,249 --> 00:59:02,835
Ta.

709
00:59:04,834 --> 00:59:07,585
Oh pardon me, but I use a
little hair-oil now and then.

710
00:59:09,702 --> 00:59:11,502
You still haven't told me your name.

711
00:59:12,206 --> 00:59:14,089
Harry.. Harry Carter.

712
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,115
Bill hasn't ever mentioned you before.

713
00:59:17,603 --> 00:59:20,762
That's just like his little ways,
isn't it. But he's a good sort, though.

714
00:59:21,551 --> 00:59:23,139
I've no need to
tell you that, though.

715
00:59:24,332 --> 00:59:25,834
I've got a soft spot for him, too.

716
00:59:26,728 --> 00:59:28,645
That's why I took the
liberty of coming to you.

717
00:59:29,455 --> 00:59:30,828
I've been troubled about him.

718
00:59:32,092 --> 00:59:32,721
Why?

719
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:34,445
Well, it's his job.

720
00:59:35,664 --> 00:59:37,853
What do you mean, exactly?
Everything is going splendidly.

721
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:40,469
Well, in a manner of
speaking, I suppose it is.

722
00:59:41,769 --> 00:59:42,412
Here.

723
00:59:42,775 --> 00:59:45,356
I got you a little present.
With my best respects.

724
00:59:45,769 --> 00:59:47,700
I do hope you don't think
it's too forward of me.

725
00:59:47,983 --> 00:59:50,044
I'm afraid I don't understand
what you're getting at.

726
00:59:50,124 --> 00:59:52,895
They are the best on the market. Not
easy to lay your hands on, these days.

727
00:59:53,144 --> 00:59:55,106
You still haven't explained, Mr Carter.

728
00:59:55,295 --> 00:59:56,972
That's alright.
Just you call me Harry.

729
00:59:57,728 --> 00:59:59,409
Anyway, me and Bill is partners.

730
00:59:59,944 --> 01:00:02,972
And just recently everything has
been going very well indeed.

731
01:00:03,797 --> 01:00:05,040
And then, all of a sudden.

732
01:00:05,463 --> 01:00:06,479
He goes to pieces.

733
01:00:07,634 --> 01:00:08,650
Now why, I wonder?

734
01:00:09,913 --> 01:00:12,861
I don't think for a moment that you are
a friend of Bill's. What is it you want?

735
01:00:13,499 --> 01:00:14,940
You can be honest with me.

736
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,706
Could it be that the little
lady went for a little ride..

737
01:00:18,976 --> 01:00:21,027
And whispered
something in his ear, eh?

738
01:00:21,783 --> 01:00:22,770
What is all this?

739
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:25,327
All that valuable stuff at the clinic.

740
01:00:25,996 --> 01:00:27,155
We had it all sewed up.

741
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:30,664
I was going to make the arrangements
and he was going to make the deliveries.

742
01:00:33,126 --> 01:00:35,319
If you don't get out of here,
I shall call the Police.

743
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:38,332
If I were you young lady,
I'd ask Bill's permission first.

744
01:00:38,758 --> 01:00:41,231
If Bill were here, he'd take you
by the scruff of your neck and..

745
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:42,362
And chuck me out?

746
01:00:43,035 --> 01:00:46,524
You put me in a really awkward position.
I don't know quite where to begin.

747
01:00:47,472 --> 01:00:50,568
Supposing we go back about
eight months. A Tuesday night.

748
01:00:51,159 --> 01:00:53,616
At the Anchor & Dolphin.
Ever heard of the place?

749
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:56,395
Yes, I have.

750
01:00:56,533 --> 01:00:59,016
Well, it was just on closing
time. I was drinking up.

751
01:00:59,557 --> 01:01:01,173
And all of a sudden,
there was trouble.

752
01:01:01,872 --> 01:01:05,055
The next thing I know, there
was a man lying dead on the floor.

753
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:07,053
Bill had killed him.

754
01:01:07,934 --> 01:01:09,693
Bill didn't kill him.
He told me he didn't.

755
01:01:10,002 --> 01:01:11,515
He ran away
because he jumped ship.

756
01:01:11,756 --> 01:01:13,108
The Police wouldn't think so.

757
01:01:13,787 --> 01:01:14,728
You are lying.

758
01:01:15,281 --> 01:01:16,708
The Police would believe me.

759
01:01:17,934 --> 01:01:19,039
And the barmaid.

760
01:01:21,485 --> 01:01:23,269
But it's safe with me, Janey.

761
01:01:23,963 --> 01:01:26,419
Because you're going to
work with us, aren't you.

762
01:01:26,887 --> 01:01:28,239
That's all I'm here for.

763
01:01:28,877 --> 01:01:30,446
Just a little cooperation.

764
01:01:30,705 --> 01:01:32,926
Everything smooth and friendly.

765
01:01:33,835 --> 01:01:35,292
No more misunderstandings.

766
01:01:36,256 --> 01:01:40,229
No more leaving Harry standing
in the rain next time, eh Janey?

767
01:01:41,033 --> 01:01:42,542
You and I will see to that.

768
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:45,150
Just good friends.
- Don't touch me.

769
01:01:47,383 --> 01:01:49,140
You ought to know
better than that.

770
01:01:51,448 --> 01:01:52,791
But it's alright.

771
01:01:54,012 --> 01:01:54,884
It's only me.

772
01:01:56,422 --> 01:01:57,158
Harry.

773
01:02:00,124 --> 01:02:02,309
But I'm going to
run things from now on.

774
01:02:04,425 --> 01:02:06,470
And when I raise my thumb
you're going to jump to it.

775
01:02:06,626 --> 01:02:07,339
No!

776
01:02:07,985 --> 01:02:08,657
Happy.

777
01:02:09,528 --> 01:02:10,354
Together.

778
01:02:11,646 --> 01:02:13,280
Nice and cosy.

779
01:02:33,121 --> 01:02:34,137
Any trouble, Miss?

780
01:03:00,438 --> 01:03:01,271
Bill.

781
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:03,441
Bill.

782
01:03:06,233 --> 01:03:06,877
Jane.

783
01:03:08,074 --> 01:03:09,506
What's wrong? What happened?

784
01:03:24,463 --> 01:03:25,678
Tell me Jane. What is it?

785
01:03:26,497 --> 01:03:27,226
Tell me.

786
01:03:28,779 --> 01:03:31,053
He came in and startled me.
He said he was a friend of yours.

787
01:03:32,327 --> 01:03:34,650
He started talking about you.
He said his name was Harry.

788
01:03:35,811 --> 01:03:38,382
He said you killed that man at the
Anchor & Dolphin. And then he..

789
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:40,135
He tried to make me think that..

790
01:03:41,069 --> 01:03:44,569
And then he came close to me and he
put his hands on me. And I stabbed him.

791
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:48,553
Stabbed?

792
01:03:48,815 --> 01:03:50,197
I think I killed him.

793
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:54,186
Jane, tell me.

794
01:03:54,982 --> 01:03:56,226
You left him in your room?

795
01:03:56,787 --> 01:03:58,649
When he fell down,
I just walked out.

796
01:04:02,214 --> 01:04:03,475
What have I done to you?

797
01:04:11,103 --> 01:04:11,918
Look, Jane.

798
01:04:12,651 --> 01:04:14,010
I'm going now.
- Going where?

799
01:04:14,199 --> 01:04:16,273
I'll be back soon.
- Can't I go with you? - No.

800
01:04:16,443 --> 01:04:18,536
It's just for just a little while.
You must wait here.

801
01:04:18,616 --> 01:04:20,002
You've got to do as I tell you.

802
01:04:21,376 --> 01:04:22,127
Alright.

803
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:25,953
Bill.

804
01:04:30,302 --> 01:04:31,346
You just wait here.

805
01:04:33,298 --> 01:04:34,571
Everything will be alright.

806
01:05:06,793 --> 01:05:07,837
I'm hurt, chum.

807
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:09,887
She hurt me bad.

808
01:05:16,383 --> 01:05:17,599
But I ain't going to die.

809
01:05:18,095 --> 01:05:19,224
I've stopped bleeding.

810
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,835
No, you're not going to die.
Not here anyway.

811
01:05:23,547 --> 01:05:26,183
Get me a doctor, chum.
- I'll get one when we're out of here.

812
01:05:26,345 --> 01:05:27,802
No.. I'm not leaving.

813
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:29,853
You'll be right if you don't
waste too much time.

814
01:05:29,933 --> 01:05:30,596
No.

815
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:33,064
Get up, or I'll finish the job.
- No! - Get up.

816
01:05:35,845 --> 01:05:37,708
Here.. where are you taking me?

817
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:39,282
I'm taking you home.

818
01:05:39,678 --> 01:05:41,642
I don't want to hear a sound
out of you until we get there.

819
01:05:58,217 --> 01:05:59,747
Here. Keep the change.
- Thank you.

820
01:06:02,276 --> 01:06:05,060
He's had a skin-full, ain't he.
- Yeah.

821
01:06:05,274 --> 01:06:08,193
By the time he's slept it off he won't
remember a blooming thing tomorrow.

822
01:06:08,543 --> 01:06:10,018
I guess not.
- Goodbye, chum.

823
01:06:10,352 --> 01:06:11,139
Goodnight.

824
01:06:34,301 --> 01:06:35,259
Better lie down.

825
01:06:37,103 --> 01:06:39,355
Now.. I'm alright now.

826
01:06:41,995 --> 01:06:43,262
I could use a drink.

827
01:06:49,457 --> 01:06:50,816
I'm going to get you a doctor.

828
01:06:51,727 --> 01:06:52,999
And you're going to tell..

829
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:55,593
You'll get me a doctor.

830
01:06:56,535 --> 01:06:58,066
I'll have a quicker way to get help.

831
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:01,182
That girl and you
double-crossing me.

832
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:03,722
I'll tell you what
I'll tell the Coppers.

833
01:07:04,573 --> 01:07:06,276
I was paying her a friendly visit.

834
01:07:07,058 --> 01:07:08,159
And she stabbed me.

835
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:10,704
Yeah.. the law will..

836
01:07:11,417 --> 01:07:12,461
Deal hard with her.

837
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:17,723
If I die.

838
01:07:19,089 --> 01:07:20,418
They'll hang the pair of you.

839
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,057
Where can I find the
Skipper of the Pelicano?

840
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:05,154
Up on the bridge.

841
01:08:09,403 --> 01:08:10,390
What do you want?

842
01:08:12,614 --> 01:08:14,453
A passage for two
and no questions asked.

843
01:08:15,433 --> 01:08:17,100
You have the wrong ship, mister.

844
01:08:17,618 --> 01:08:18,782
We carry cargo.

845
01:08:24,694 --> 01:08:26,249
We still carry cargo.

846
01:08:31,155 --> 01:08:31,909
Enough?

847
01:08:34,725 --> 01:08:36,602
No.
It's all I've got.

848
01:08:39,524 --> 01:08:40,957
What about the other party?

849
01:08:41,945 --> 01:08:42,817
It's a woman.

850
01:08:43,539 --> 01:08:44,268
My wife.

851
01:08:44,914 --> 01:08:46,183
It's not worth the risk.

852
01:08:51,236 --> 01:08:52,423
I'm a friend of Harry's.

853
01:08:54,122 --> 01:08:56,112
I know a lot of Harrys.
- You know this one.

854
01:08:56,851 --> 01:08:58,010
He had a deal with you.

855
01:09:06,877 --> 01:09:07,835
What went wrong?

856
01:09:09,314 --> 01:09:10,415
He couldn't swing it.

857
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:15,031
Could you?

858
01:09:17,649 --> 01:09:19,369
It might make a lot of difference.

859
01:09:20,848 --> 01:09:22,207
It's too tough. I can't do it.

860
01:09:22,767 --> 01:09:23,428
Why?

861
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:25,223
Isn't she worth it?

862
01:09:28,126 --> 01:09:30,382
It is 10:24.
I have my sailing orders.

863
01:09:31,224 --> 01:09:32,939
I have to be out
of the harbour by 12.

864
01:09:33,404 --> 01:09:34,648
You think you can make it?

865
01:10:43,469 --> 01:10:45,012
"Hello, Janey."

866
01:10:48,359 --> 01:10:50,068
"It was in the Anchor & Dolphin."

867
01:10:51,259 --> 01:10:52,551
"Ever heard of the place?"

868
01:10:53,913 --> 01:10:56,361
"A man is lying dead on the floor. "

869
01:10:57,423 --> 01:10:58,672
"Bill had killed him. "

870
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:04,695
"No more leaving Harry standing
in the rain, next time, eh Janey?"

871
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,360
"The Police will believe me. "

872
01:11:09,581 --> 01:11:11,048
"And the barmaid. "

873
01:11:12,789 --> 01:11:14,206
"It's only me. "

874
01:11:15,103 --> 01:11:15,858
"Harry. "

875
01:11:17,251 --> 01:11:17,980
"Harry. "

876
01:11:18,882 --> 01:11:19,768
"Together. "

877
01:11:20,931 --> 01:11:23,124
"Nice and cosy. "

878
01:13:22,010 --> 01:13:23,336
Jane.. Jane.

879
01:13:24,581 --> 01:13:26,026
Oh, I thought I'd never find you.

880
01:13:26,866 --> 01:13:27,676
Why did you leave the room?

881
01:13:27,756 --> 01:13:30,151
I am so glad to see you.
I was so afraid I..

882
01:13:31,188 --> 01:13:33,350
I thought I heard
Harry's voice, but I..

883
01:13:35,633 --> 01:13:36,476
Jane, look.

884
01:13:37,188 --> 01:13:38,261
I went to your room.

885
01:13:38,628 --> 01:13:39,690
Harry wasn't there.

886
01:13:40,046 --> 01:13:42,806
You couldn't have done more than scratch
the guy as he got free, and ran away.

887
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:44,458
He wasn't there?

888
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,164
No. He wasn't there.

889
01:13:47,753 --> 01:13:48,914
Oh, thank goodness.

890
01:13:49,789 --> 01:13:52,065
But he may have gone
to the Police about you.

891
01:13:52,327 --> 01:13:53,879
Jane, look.
We don't have much time.

892
01:13:54,628 --> 01:13:57,017
There is a ship leaving for Lisbon
tonight. We can still make it.

893
01:13:57,097 --> 01:13:59,390
We'll go to Canada, the States.
Any place we can be alone.

894
01:13:59,533 --> 01:14:01,890
Where people will let us alone.
We'll be together. Will you go?

895
01:14:02,528 --> 01:14:04,676
Yes. All I want to
do is be with you.

896
01:14:04,978 --> 01:14:06,337
Alright, come on. Let's hurry.

897
01:14:41,422 --> 01:14:42,094
Funny.

898
01:14:43,817 --> 01:14:45,233
Every headlight is a Police car.

899
01:14:45,919 --> 01:14:46,992
I'm sure it's a Cop.

900
01:14:48,404 --> 01:14:49,563
But they won't stop us.

901
01:14:50,473 --> 01:14:51,604
Nobody will stop us.

902
01:15:11,081 --> 01:15:12,211
It's full of supplies.

903
01:15:13,202 --> 01:15:14,529
No. They are empty cartons.

904
01:15:21,352 --> 01:15:22,253
We'll make it.

905
01:15:24,747 --> 01:15:25,763
What's the matter?

906
01:15:25,897 --> 01:15:27,662
What are you thinking about?
- It's cold.

907
01:15:28,585 --> 01:15:29,543
Take my coat.

908
01:15:58,162 --> 01:16:00,738
Jane. - I killed him.
- Jane, please. - I did, I did.

909
01:16:01,042 --> 01:16:02,934
He was no good, it wasn't
your fault. - I killed him.

910
01:16:08,905 --> 01:16:10,352
I can't go.
- You've got to.

911
01:16:10,591 --> 01:16:14,285
No, Bill. I've never loved anyone
so much, ever. But I can't go.

912
01:16:14,483 --> 01:16:15,726
What do you want us to do?

913
01:16:15,916 --> 01:16:17,455
I've got to go back.
- What for?

914
01:16:17,818 --> 01:16:19,077
No-one can prove anything.

915
01:16:19,157 --> 01:16:21,196
No-one has to prove anything.
I know what I've done.

916
01:16:22,005 --> 01:16:23,850
What have you done that
I haven't made you do?

917
01:16:24,109 --> 01:16:25,840
You haven't done anything.
- Bill, please.

918
01:16:26,445 --> 01:16:28,232
You can say it was
self-defence and get off.

919
01:16:28,601 --> 01:16:30,658
But if I go back I won't get off.
I'll be sticking my head in a rope.

920
01:16:30,738 --> 01:16:31,908
Is that what you want?

921
01:16:31,988 --> 01:16:34,578
No. That man at the Anchor & Dolphin.
That was an accident, was it?

922
01:16:34,658 --> 01:16:36,301
Maybe it was.
Maybe I meant to kill him.

923
01:16:36,604 --> 01:16:37,712
There's a difference.

924
01:16:37,792 --> 01:16:39,662
Who's going to believe that?
- They might understand.

925
01:16:39,742 --> 01:16:41,976
Listen, no-one gives anybody
a break. Not me, anyway.

926
01:16:42,561 --> 01:16:44,052
Run, run, run. All the time.

927
01:16:44,366 --> 01:16:46,469
Run from my old man.
Run from the kid I hurt in school.

928
01:16:46,609 --> 01:16:49,197
That's why I didn't mind the Army.
When you hit, you didn't have to run.

929
01:16:49,501 --> 01:16:51,032
Everybody is against you. Everybody!

930
01:16:52,490 --> 01:16:53,734
I'm not, Bill. I love you.

931
01:16:56,958 --> 01:16:58,145
Then listen to me, Jane.

932
01:16:59,424 --> 01:17:00,468
We'll find a place.

933
01:17:01,159 --> 01:17:03,790
It won't be the sort of life we
planned this afternoon on the hill.

934
01:17:04,964 --> 01:17:06,580
We will, we will. We'll have that, too.

935
01:17:07,514 --> 01:17:08,913
We'll b alone. Well be hunted.

936
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:11,806
There is nothing else.

937
01:17:12,677 --> 01:17:14,408
Do you think it's just
the man in the pub?

938
01:17:14,488 --> 01:17:17,471
The stuff in the truck is drugs alright.
I stole them to pay for our passage.

939
01:17:18,408 --> 01:17:19,509
Jane, don't leave me!

940
01:17:19,805 --> 01:17:20,563
Don't go.

941
01:17:26,945 --> 01:17:27,970
I need you.

942
01:17:29,722 --> 01:17:30,679
Oh, I need you.

943
01:17:35,479 --> 01:17:37,027
I don't know what's best for you.

944
01:17:37,815 --> 01:17:38,716
All I know is.

945
01:17:38,970 --> 01:17:41,448
What I can't do is I can't run
away from the thing I've done.

946
01:17:42,536 --> 01:17:44,520
And I know I don't
want to live without you.

947
01:17:50,238 --> 01:17:51,711
I didn't want to be alone anymore.

948
01:17:54,187 --> 01:17:55,516
I don't want to be alone now.

949
01:17:57,507 --> 01:17:58,535
If we go back.

950
01:17:59,583 --> 01:18:00,684
If we stick together.

951
01:18:01,587 --> 01:18:02,500
If we face it.

952
01:18:04,007 --> 01:18:05,108
Do you think that..?

953
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:06,814
Maybe somewhere.

954
01:18:07,818 --> 01:18:08,918
Somebody will listen.

955
01:18:09,942 --> 01:18:11,866
Somebody will say it
wasn't all our fault?

956
01:18:14,354 --> 01:18:15,399
Not yours anyway.

957
01:18:26,298 --> 01:18:27,657
Maybe they'll give us a break.

958
01:18:29,128 --> 01:18:30,171
Maybe they won't.

959
01:18:31,788 --> 01:18:33,820
We'll see.
