00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,822
The aftermath of war is rubble...
the rubble of cities and of men...

4
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:04,373
They are the casualties
of a pitiless destruction.

5
00:02:04,837 --> 00:02:06,971
The cities can be rebuilt,
but the wounds of men,

6
00:02:07,298 --> 00:02:10,164
whether of the mind or of
the body, heal slowly.

7
00:02:16,013 --> 00:02:21,957
This is the story of one such man:
and of the girl whose path he crossed...

8
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:41,994
Time gentlemen. Drink up.

9
00:02:52,013 --> 00:02:52,965
Come along, David.

10
00:02:53,595 --> 00:02:57,320
Come on there, Harry boy. It's time.
- That's the trouble with this world today.

11
00:02:57,533 --> 00:02:59,613
Everyone is in
such a blooming hurry.

12
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,469
Goodnight, George.
- Goodnight. See you tommorow.

13
00:03:09,368 --> 00:03:11,069
It's time, mate.
You'll have to drink up.

14
00:03:11,429 --> 00:03:13,414
Now come on now.
- You heard me. We're closing.

15
00:03:17,218 --> 00:03:19,006
You want to get rough-like,
do you? Come on.

16
00:03:32,464 --> 00:03:33,199
Chum.

17
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:35,184
You've been and
gone and done it.

18
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,639
He's dead.
You killed him.

19
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,909
Alright.

20
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,356
Stop him!

21
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,590
What did he do?

22
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,508
He killed the governor.
That's what he did.

23
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:14,061
Hey, what's going on here?

24
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,365
Did he pass you?
A big fellah running?

25
00:05:57,445 --> 00:05:59,575
No. Nobody passed me.
- He must have gone this way then.

26
00:07:35,675 --> 00:07:37,392
Who is it? What do you want?

27
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:40,574
We're looking for a man, missus.
He might be in one of these houses.

28
00:07:40,963 --> 00:07:42,150
He's not in this house.

29
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,444
I keep this house respectable, I do.
And no thanks to the Police, neither.

30
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:51,496
You won't get hurt if you
keep quiet. Understand?

31
00:07:55,502 --> 00:07:56,947
You just try anything and I'll..

32
00:08:03,776 --> 00:08:05,534
Don't make a move and
keep your mouth shut.

33
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,682
Do you live alone?

34
00:08:48,752 --> 00:08:51,569
There's no sense in standing there. You
might as well make yourself comfortable.

35
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,926
I'm staying for a while.
You'd better get used to the idea.

36
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:13,774
There is nothing to be scared of.

37
00:09:14,376 --> 00:09:15,724
Then why are you scared?

38
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,798
Where do you think you're going?

39
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:58,423
Nowhere at the moment, but in
about an hour I've a job to go to.

40
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:01,137
What makes you
think I'll let you go?

41
00:10:01,738 --> 00:10:03,898
If you don't they'll send
someone down to see if I'm ill.

42
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:07,551
Who is "they"?
- The Institution. - The What?

43
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,977
The Mary Wilson Institute.
I work in a clinic there.

44
00:10:17,773 --> 00:10:19,417
I watched you
while you were sleeping.

45
00:10:20,156 --> 00:10:20,971
You talked.

46
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:23,531
What did I say?

47
00:10:24,696 --> 00:10:25,909
Nothing incriminating.

48
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:40,621
How about some coffee?

49
00:10:40,943 --> 00:10:42,388
There is tea here if you want it.

50
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:44,393
The milk is outside the front door.

51
00:10:45,203 --> 00:10:46,362
We'll drink it without.

52
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:49,286
I don't like it without.

53
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:52,844
I'll fetch it.

54
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:35,591
I have to go.

55
00:11:37,746 --> 00:11:39,218
How come you didn't tell the Cops?

56
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,295
What time you get back?

57
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,458
About seven.

58
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:49,175
And I don't expect to find
you here when I do get back.

59
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,767
What if I am?

60
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:52,886
I hardly think you will be.

61
00:11:54,696 --> 00:11:56,255
I'll stick around until it gets dark.

62
00:11:57,335 --> 00:11:58,925
Did you rob or kill someone?

63
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:02,951
That's what they think.

64
00:12:03,883 --> 00:12:05,270
I was in a bar, drinking alone.

65
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,911
A fight started.. somebody
got slugged and I ducked out.

66
00:12:08,957 --> 00:12:10,287
I'm new around here, you see.

67
00:12:11,127 --> 00:12:12,170
And they chased me.

68
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,577
You sure that's all?
- Sure that's all.

69
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:21,020
Just a minute.

70
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:23,622
Yes?

71
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:26,577
Nothing.

72
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:29,763
You're a good kid.

73
00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:37,552
Good morning, dear.
- Good morning, Mrs Gale.

74
00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:40,440
Up early this morning, aren't you?
- I saw you going for the milk.

75
00:12:40,696 --> 00:12:42,200
We expect rather a busy day.

76
00:12:42,855 --> 00:12:45,136
Oh you needn't bother to do
my room. I've done it already.

77
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:46,725
Thank you, dear.

78
00:14:13,226 --> 00:14:14,814
Not a peep out of
you, you understand?

79
00:16:16,903 --> 00:16:18,760
Will it hurt?
- A little.

80
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:26,649
Will this make my ear better?
- Very soon. You'll see.

81
00:16:27,097 --> 00:16:28,813
Now.. take a deep breath.

82
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:33,190
There.. that's all it is.

83
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:36,243
I didn't cry.
- I didn't think you would.

84
00:16:36,843 --> 00:16:39,509
Next Monday, same time.
- Thank you so much, Miss.

85
00:16:40,143 --> 00:16:42,238
I'm sure your ear will
be better, Donald, so..

86
00:16:42,478 --> 00:16:45,350
Have a nice weekend, but no
rough play now. Not until next week.

87
00:16:45,431 --> 00:16:46,957
Have a nice weekend yourself.

88
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,223
Thank you. Goodbye, Donald.
- Goodbye.

89
00:16:58,061 --> 00:16:58,733
Hello.

90
00:17:00,744 --> 00:17:02,116
Oh it's you.
Yeah.

91
00:17:03,136 --> 00:17:04,123
What do you want?

92
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:06,068
Nothing. I just
wanted to say hello.

93
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:07,975
Then, hello.

94
00:17:12,947 --> 00:17:15,076
Let's get this straightened
out. I don't run a hotel.

95
00:17:15,111 --> 00:17:17,109
I'm not looking for one.
- What are you looking for?

96
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:18,812
Nothing. I'm not looking for nothing.

97
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,525
Do I have to call the Police?

98
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:23,308
What for? I only want to talk to you.
- But I don't like your talking to me.

99
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:25,492
I don't like you walking
along with me, either.

100
00:17:25,602 --> 00:17:28,804
If I do call a Policeman, he may like to
know you forced your way in my room.

101
00:17:29,296 --> 00:17:31,075
And also the part you
played in that brawl.

102
00:17:31,373 --> 00:17:33,422
I told you what happened.
- A man was killed.

103
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:37,055
If you really want to know why
I ducked out, I'll tell you. I jumped ship.

104
00:17:37,494 --> 00:17:40,254
I wasn't going to wait around for any
Cops to pick me up. That's on the level.

105
00:17:40,682 --> 00:17:42,818
I just stopped by to say
hello. And give you this.

106
00:17:44,098 --> 00:17:45,178
Thanks. I thought..

107
00:17:45,516 --> 00:17:46,902
You thought I'd lifted it, huh?

108
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:49,309
I don't go stealing stuff from
people that do me favours.

109
00:17:49,389 --> 00:17:51,177
I just slipped it into
my pocket by mistake.

110
00:17:51,357 --> 00:17:52,315
Well, I'm sorry.

111
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:54,705
But, do you mind
if I say goodbye now.

112
00:18:36,062 --> 00:18:37,106
Must you follow me?

113
00:18:37,487 --> 00:18:39,018
Maybe I've got
nothing better to do.

114
00:18:39,936 --> 00:18:43,049
Oh, cut it out will you. Do you have to
be sore all the time? I won't hurt you.

115
00:18:43,129 --> 00:18:45,200
Please leave me alone.
I don't know who you are.

116
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,660
What's the difference who I am?
I just want to talk to you.

117
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:49,694
My name is Bill. Bill Saunders.

118
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:52,248
That doesn't tell me very much.
- Alright, what do you want to know?

119
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:54,755
I was born in Canada, raised
in Detroit. - Why don't you go back?

120
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:56,034
Go back?

121
00:18:56,914 --> 00:18:57,643
To what?

122
00:18:58,196 --> 00:18:59,297
Something. Someone.

123
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,004
There's nobody. Nothing.

124
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:19,217
You're pretty lonely yourself.

125
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:36,708
Come on. Let's get out of here.

126
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:43,664
What's the matter?
Haven't you seen a zoo before?

127
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:45,597
I've been in one all my life.

128
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:47,737
I don't like to be
reminded of it. That's all.

129
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:49,569
You're shaking.

130
00:20:50,187 --> 00:20:51,803
I can't stand to see
anything caged up.

131
00:20:52,894 --> 00:20:54,509
Have you never
been behind barbed wire?

132
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:55,803
Have you?

133
00:20:55,886 --> 00:20:57,579
Almost two years
in a Nazi prison camp.

134
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,079
Being shoved around by those..

135
00:21:00,854 --> 00:21:03,485
You think those monkeys are something?
You want to see men in cages.

136
00:21:07,604 --> 00:21:09,094
Do you want some.. peanuts?

137
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,769
Alright.

138
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,000
Your name is Jane?

139
00:21:28,796 --> 00:21:29,726
I saw the book.

140
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:31,119
Oh.

141
00:21:33,973 --> 00:21:35,016
Who is the Officer?

142
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,806
Who?
- The guy in the photo.

143
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:38,152
Oh.

144
00:21:39,282 --> 00:21:40,634
That's Loyd. He was killed.

145
00:21:43,172 --> 00:21:43,987
Tough luck.

146
00:21:49,137 --> 00:21:50,210
Did you get over it?

147
00:21:52,451 --> 00:21:53,634
Do you get over things?

148
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,651
Do you ever go to the races?

149
00:21:58,731 --> 00:22:00,608
Horse racing?
- Uhuh. - No, I don't.

150
00:22:00,688 --> 00:22:02,761
You ought to try it. You ought
to try everything once.

151
00:22:04,715 --> 00:22:06,188
Will you go with
me this Saturday?

152
00:22:06,374 --> 00:22:08,018
I won't bother you
until then if you do.

153
00:22:10,866 --> 00:22:11,967
You are very strange.

154
00:22:57,749 --> 00:22:58,945
Do you think we're late?

155
00:22:59,025 --> 00:23:00,747
I guess we've missed the
first race. It don't matter.

156
00:23:00,827 --> 00:23:02,270
It's the second race that counts.

157
00:23:04,494 --> 00:23:07,583
Don't think I've come down here from
London with the object of making money.

158
00:23:08,258 --> 00:23:10,884
I ask you.. do I look
as if I needed money?

159
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,290
I come down here with
the sole and only purpose.

160
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:15,123
Of assisting you to return home.

161
00:23:15,453 --> 00:23:17,866
Lighter in heart,
but heavier in pocket.

162
00:23:18,441 --> 00:23:20,687
Each and every one of these
envelopes, ladies and gentlemen.

163
00:23:20,788 --> 00:23:22,403
Contains the winner
of the second race.

164
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:25,586
Five shillings is the regular price
of the ordinary Doubting Thomas.

165
00:23:26,052 --> 00:23:27,497
But to you, ladies and gentlemen.

166
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:29,745
I will pass on this
red-hot information.

167
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,573
For just one paltry shilling.

168
00:23:31,982 --> 00:23:32,998
One shilling, sir.

169
00:23:33,431 --> 00:23:34,474
One, sir. One, sir.

170
00:23:34,844 --> 00:23:35,621
One, sir.

171
00:23:37,108 --> 00:23:37,866
One, sir?

172
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:39,146
One.

173
00:23:41,157 --> 00:23:42,087
How many, lady?

174
00:23:42,663 --> 00:23:44,418
Just a bob.
Twelve miserable coppers.

175
00:23:44,498 --> 00:23:46,467
Beat it. Save it for
the suckers. - No, please.

176
00:23:46,547 --> 00:23:48,693
Here you are. Thank you
very much. - Thank you, lady.

177
00:23:52,135 --> 00:23:54,029
2nd race.. "Sudden Cloud".

178
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,131
Sudden Cloud. Sudden Cloud is..

179
00:23:56,491 --> 00:23:57,607
Thirty-five to one.

180
00:23:57,778 --> 00:24:00,052
Isn't that a good horse?
- Sure, if all the others drop dead.

181
00:24:00,563 --> 00:24:02,372
I know what's going to
win the 2nd race. - You do?

182
00:24:02,677 --> 00:24:03,950
"Dairy Maid". It's a cinch.

183
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:06,322
How can you be so sure?
- I got it straight from the jockey.

184
00:24:06,402 --> 00:24:07,817
It's in the bag for Dairy Maid.

185
00:24:07,897 --> 00:24:11,315
Anyway, I'm going to put a bet on Sudden
Cloud as it's such a wonderful name.

186
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:13,833
What will I get if it wins?
- If it wins..

187
00:24:13,992 --> 00:24:16,879
You get 35 times what you put up.
- Oh, but that's too simple.

188
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:18,655
We'd better place our bets, then

189
00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:19,970
Here, put this on it.

190
00:24:20,318 --> 00:24:23,434
You must be mad. A whole pound?
And I wouldn't take it from you.

191
00:24:23,764 --> 00:24:27,183
I wouldn't think of putting on more than
a shilling. I'm a working girl, you know.

192
00:24:27,703 --> 00:24:30,199
I would like to put a shilling
on Sudden Cloud, please.

193
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,129
35 to one lady.

194
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:36,966
He talked so fast I couldn't tell what
he said. But I suppose it's alright.

195
00:24:37,163 --> 00:24:38,207
Will it start soon?

196
00:24:46,605 --> 00:24:49,263
So which one is Sudden Cloud?
- Number six. Right there.

197
00:24:49,563 --> 00:24:51,298
I can't see.
- She's six lengths behind.

198
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:52,631
I can't see a thing.

199
00:24:58,524 --> 00:25:00,255
Come on, Sudden Cloud.
- Where is she now?

200
00:25:00,353 --> 00:25:02,398
I don't know. Which is it?
- It's the jockey in blue.

201
00:25:02,489 --> 00:25:03,624
Come on, Sudden Cloud.

202
00:25:08,154 --> 00:25:09,446
It's all over.
- Who won?

203
00:25:10,951 --> 00:25:11,823
I don't know.

204
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,373
Look up there. The number board.

205
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:19,463
She won!

206
00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:22,646
I knew she would. That little man
knew what he was talking about.

207
00:25:23,393 --> 00:25:25,569
Oh, and your Dairy Maid.. I'm sorry.

208
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,629
Give me your tickets.
I'll collect for you.

209
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:28,987
Uhuh. That's half the fun.

210
00:25:29,255 --> 00:25:30,681
Okay, go ahead. I'll wait here.

211
00:25:39,014 --> 00:25:41,948
Hello, chum.. fancy meeting you.

212
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:46,723
Afraid you've got the wrong guy.

213
00:25:46,803 --> 00:25:48,879
Now you've hurt my feelings.
Because I remember you.

214
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:53,268
It does me good to see you walk about
as large as life and twice as handsome.

215
00:25:54,526 --> 00:25:56,500
And free. Free as air.

216
00:25:57,966 --> 00:25:59,926
It's alright. The girl won't
be back for a minute.

217
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:02,275
She's nice looking,
ain't she? Quite a lady.

218
00:26:02,655 --> 00:26:04,558
I told you I don't know you.
- Now take it easy.

219
00:26:04,837 --> 00:26:06,949
I'm not a Copper
and this ain't a touch.

220
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,069
So you've nothing to
worry about either way.

221
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:10,828
Get away from me.

222
00:26:11,098 --> 00:26:12,775
Alright, alright, alright.

223
00:26:13,314 --> 00:26:15,703
And if you should ever need
a friend, there is always Harry.

224
00:26:16,378 --> 00:26:19,154
The day a pal of mine is in trouble,
that's the day I rise and shine.

225
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:22,985
Remember that.. a friend
in need is a friend indeed.

226
00:26:23,688 --> 00:26:24,560
Robbie Burns.

227
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,181
Goodbye, chum.

228
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,549
Two more. Altogether, that's
42 shillings to the good.

229
00:26:38,784 --> 00:26:41,025
A fine afternoon's work.
- All that money! It's wicked.

230
00:26:41,105 --> 00:26:42,718
What do you want
to do? Give it back?

231
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:44,875
Take you to tea and miss
the crowds on the train.

232
00:26:45,112 --> 00:26:47,015
Oh I didn't ask you.
How did you do? - I didn't.

233
00:26:47,467 --> 00:26:48,053
Oh.

234
00:26:48,338 --> 00:26:50,792
You come to the races often?
- Often enough. But never with a girl.

235
00:26:51,216 --> 00:26:52,583
Oh, a likely story.

236
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,280
Never with a girl
as lucky as you.

237
00:27:06,481 --> 00:27:08,011
I haven't had
a day like this for..

238
00:27:08,095 --> 00:27:09,052
For a long time.

239
00:27:09,355 --> 00:27:10,514
It's been fun.
- Good.

240
00:27:10,946 --> 00:27:12,076
No, really. I mean it.

241
00:27:14,088 --> 00:27:14,813
Tired?

242
00:27:14,893 --> 00:27:16,880
Hmm. I'm completely done
over, but it was worth it.

243
00:27:19,152 --> 00:27:21,170
You got a family?
- Nah. - Nobody?

244
00:27:21,955 --> 00:27:23,486
Well, at least
we're alike that way.

245
00:27:24,782 --> 00:27:27,715
You're educated. Anybody
can see that. - Oh, can they?

246
00:27:28,793 --> 00:27:30,238
I never got past the sixth grade.

247
00:27:33,258 --> 00:27:34,302
What goes with you?

248
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:36,601
Oh, with me?

249
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:39,159
Well, I was a proper little girl.

250
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,536
Seen but not heard. Never
caused anybody any trouble.

251
00:27:41,616 --> 00:27:44,044
Didn't help very much, did it?
They kicked your teeth in anyway.

252
00:27:44,124 --> 00:27:45,196
The RAF guy, I mean.

253
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,109
But I wasn't the only one.

254
00:27:50,356 --> 00:27:52,201
What kind of a job have
you got at that place?

255
00:27:52,792 --> 00:27:53,445
Oh.

256
00:27:54,218 --> 00:27:56,476
I'm sort of...
assistant to everybody.

257
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:58,598
Like it?
- Hmm. Love it. I feel useful.

258
00:28:00,207 --> 00:28:01,470
It is not a bad feeling.

259
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:06,975
Cigarette?

260
00:28:08,091 --> 00:28:10,082
It isn't a smoker.
- Oh.

261
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:11,353
But go ahead.

262
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:12,938
Alright.

263
00:28:39,811 --> 00:28:42,913
You and me is always bumping into each
other. Ha.. must be in our horoscopes.

264
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,472
A good sign, eh?

265
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,888
Your young lady friend seems a bit
keen on you. Anyone can see that.

266
00:28:49,422 --> 00:28:51,439
But then of course,
you're the sort they all go for.

267
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:52,631
Flappers and ladies.

268
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,131
I said "lady".

269
00:28:54,981 --> 00:28:57,131
Confidentially, I saw you
counting your money just now.

270
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,093
It wasn't much of a count, was it.

271
00:28:59,302 --> 00:29:00,203
No. It wasn't.

272
00:29:00,938 --> 00:29:03,126
You know, I took a shine to
you the first time I seen you.

273
00:29:03,622 --> 00:29:05,095
That night in the pub.
- Shut up.

274
00:29:05,274 --> 00:29:06,318
Can you imagine..?

275
00:29:06,855 --> 00:29:08,776
I can't even remember
the name of it now.

276
00:29:10,534 --> 00:29:11,178
Here.

277
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,734
There is a certain
proposition I've heard of.

278
00:29:15,507 --> 00:29:16,434
A proposition?

279
00:29:16,514 --> 00:29:19,045
Oh, just a little business venture
of mine. I could do with a partner.

280
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,579
A young man. Strong, courageous.
Handy with his fists.

281
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:23,877
There's fifty quid in it.

282
00:29:25,503 --> 00:29:27,423
Nothing doing.
- Reformed, eh?

283
00:29:27,941 --> 00:29:30,095
Stop blocking the corridor, please.

284
00:29:31,623 --> 00:29:32,410
Look here.

285
00:29:33,098 --> 00:29:34,828
If you want to
impress the young lady.

286
00:29:35,785 --> 00:29:37,938
Don't forget that sort
of thing takes money.

287
00:29:46,196 --> 00:29:47,772
No objection if I sit here?

288
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,812
Mind if I put up my feet?
- No. Not at all.

289
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,942
Oh that's better. I've
been on my feet all day.

290
00:29:57,918 --> 00:30:00,023
I mustn't grumble though.
I've had a very good day.

291
00:30:00,505 --> 00:30:05,317
I'm in artificial fuel. Thermal-Cake.
It looks like coal, burns like coal.

292
00:30:05,483 --> 00:30:08,348
Lasts longer. Smells better.
Ever tried it, Miss?

293
00:30:08,761 --> 00:30:10,299
No, I don't believe I have.

294
00:30:11,871 --> 00:30:12,515
Well.

295
00:30:13,088 --> 00:30:15,143
In case you should
ever want any, here.

296
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:19,827
Are you together?
- Yeah.

297
00:30:33,704 --> 00:30:36,497
I don't know what I'd do
without the devil's picture-books.

298
00:30:37,315 --> 00:30:38,694
Travelling about like this.

299
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:41,779
A fellow has got to
keep his mind occupied.

300
00:30:43,435 --> 00:30:44,422
Like card tricks?

301
00:30:47,664 --> 00:30:48,497
You, Miss?

302
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:49,941
Not particularly.

303
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,362
Here's one I bet you never saw.
Take a card. Any card.

304
00:30:56,196 --> 00:30:58,033
Now look at it.
Don't show it to me.

305
00:30:58,362 --> 00:31:00,214
Now put it back.
Remember what it was.

306
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,400
Got it?

307
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:05,929
Two of diamonds. What?

308
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,311
That's very good.

309
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:08,657
Have you seen this one?

310
00:31:14,187 --> 00:31:15,489
King, Queen, Jack of spades.

311
00:31:19,818 --> 00:31:20,977
Which one is the Queen?

312
00:31:24,891 --> 00:31:26,612
Oh.. that's good, Bill.

313
00:31:26,941 --> 00:31:29,364
Sleight of hand. Deceives the
eye and all that you know.

314
00:31:29,818 --> 00:31:30,834
Take another card.

315
00:31:37,682 --> 00:31:40,195
No, no, no.
There is your Queen.

316
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,607
Not bad.

317
00:31:43,582 --> 00:31:46,128
I've a natural eye. Probably
from doing tricks myself.

318
00:31:48,356 --> 00:31:49,703
I still think I can fool you.

319
00:31:49,886 --> 00:31:51,516
I doubt it. I doubt it.

320
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:52,746
Want to try?

321
00:31:52,826 --> 00:31:55,017
Don't care if I do. But I'm
warning you, though.

322
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,285
Cover that.

323
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,229
Well.

324
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:01,654
Well.

325
00:32:01,985 --> 00:32:03,613
I don't mind if I do.

326
00:32:08,368 --> 00:32:09,126
That one.

327
00:32:10,645 --> 00:32:12,292
Say, you are quick.

328
00:32:12,755 --> 00:32:13,956
That's me, alright.

329
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:17,135
I bet I can still fool you.
Try again, double.

330
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,895
Not for me.

331
00:32:25,403 --> 00:32:26,619
I said try again. Double.

332
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:29,331
I said no. Clear, isn't it?

333
00:32:31,246 --> 00:32:32,347
Come on. Pick a card.

334
00:32:32,715 --> 00:32:33,874
What do you think I am?

335
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:37,805
I wasn't born in the world to be
cheated by an incompetent card-sharp.

336
00:32:38,073 --> 00:32:39,089
You'd better play!

337
00:32:39,346 --> 00:32:40,030
Bill.

338
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:43,077
And you'd better take some more
lessons, my fine feathered friend.

339
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,476
Bill, don't!

340
00:32:44,969 --> 00:32:46,191
Help.. help!

341
00:33:05,422 --> 00:33:06,748
Take your hands off me!

342
00:33:07,514 --> 00:33:10,391
You shouldn't have pulled the cord. We'd
have been right if you'd kept your head.

343
00:33:10,471 --> 00:33:12,116
Come on.
I'm not going with you.

344
00:33:12,622 --> 00:33:13,638
What's the matter?

345
00:33:13,775 --> 00:33:16,474
Him? He was no good. Did you
see the way he looked at you?

346
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,422
I don't ever want
to see you again.

347
00:33:28,955 --> 00:33:29,941
Listen, will you.

348
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:31,960
I didn't do it just for the
sake of it. I had to.

349
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,169
One of me, one of him.

350
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:35,846
He had a nice time of..
- I was out of my mind to go with you.

351
00:33:35,926 --> 00:33:36,948
Have a nice time?

352
00:33:37,028 --> 00:33:38,818
Yes, I thought I was
wrong about you, but..

353
00:33:39,229 --> 00:33:41,868
Now I see you as you really are.
You are everything bad.

354
00:33:42,517 --> 00:33:43,732
I never did you any harm.

355
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:44,906
Didn't you?

356
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:47,614
Jane.

357
00:33:48,438 --> 00:33:50,200
Will you please let me go.
- Listen to me.

358
00:33:51,277 --> 00:33:53,809
There is nobody else I want to be with.
Nobody else I want to talk to.

359
00:33:54,593 --> 00:33:55,752
What's wrong with that?

360
00:33:55,855 --> 00:33:58,152
I'll tell you what's wrong.
You're wrong. You are a coward.

361
00:33:58,426 --> 00:33:59,957
There was one of
him and one of you.

362
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:03,478
He was an older man. I suppose if you'd
hit a child, you'd say the same thing.

363
00:34:03,921 --> 00:34:07,155
What's the matter with you? Why can't
you be decent like everybody else?

364
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:10,020
You're nothing but a
cheap, vicious bully.

365
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,067
Jane.. Jane!

366
00:34:13,662 --> 00:34:15,900
Come on now. Let's
leave this young lady be.

367
00:34:29,392 --> 00:34:30,639
William Earle Saunders.

368
00:34:31,148 --> 00:34:34,182
You have been found guilty
on two serious counts.

369
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:37,590
The first, robbery with
violence against one..

370
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:38,961
Thomas Widgery.

371
00:34:39,637 --> 00:34:42,250
The second, a savage and
unprovoked attack..

372
00:34:42,491 --> 00:34:45,328
Against an Officer of the law in
the execution of his duties.

373
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,582
Have you anything to
say in your defence?

374
00:34:48,411 --> 00:34:49,061
No.

375
00:34:50,118 --> 00:34:52,693
I then sentence you,
William Earle Saunders.

376
00:34:53,089 --> 00:34:55,494
To six months hard
labour on each count.

377
00:34:56,008 --> 00:34:57,562
Sentences to run concurrently.

378
00:34:58,184 --> 00:34:59,071
Furthermore.

379
00:34:59,435 --> 00:35:01,412
Although these appear
to be first offenses.

380
00:35:02,138 --> 00:35:04,290
In view of the brutal
nature of the assaults.

381
00:35:04,747 --> 00:35:06,159
I have no alternative.

382
00:35:06,553 --> 00:35:10,687
But to direct that you receive
eighteen strokes of the cat-of-nine-tails.

383
00:36:11,723 --> 00:36:12,309
Go.

384
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:16,893
Go.

385
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,898
Go.

386
00:36:23,018 --> 00:36:23,775
Go.

387
00:37:30,607 --> 00:37:31,593
This table taken?

388
00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:33,010
Help yourself.

389
00:37:54,184 --> 00:37:55,505
Waiting for someone, mate?

390
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:58,806
Care to run a few?

391
00:37:59,448 --> 00:38:00,079
No.

392
00:38:00,732 --> 00:38:02,009
Just for sport, mate.

393
00:38:04,391 --> 00:38:05,152
Yeah.

394
00:38:14,748 --> 00:38:18,044
Just a wee bit more English,
as they say.. eh, Chum?

395
00:38:22,952 --> 00:38:24,338
You sure get around, don't you.

396
00:38:24,995 --> 00:38:27,144
How are you feeling after
your little vacation, eh?

397
00:38:27,916 --> 00:38:29,407
Great.
I'm happy to hear that.

398
00:38:29,587 --> 00:38:30,518
Truly I am.

399
00:38:30,878 --> 00:38:33,680
You know, you've been popping in and
out of my thoughts like a blooming rabbit.

400
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:35,580
Here, George.
Come over here.

401
00:38:36,376 --> 00:38:38,284
How about a little game
of snooker on me, eh?

402
00:38:38,891 --> 00:38:40,707
Here, set them up,
my little cock-sparrow.

403
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,033
How you fixed?
Got anything in view?

404
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:49,314
A nice, pleasing situation?

405
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:52,189
Fixing to blow soon.
Get out of town.

406
00:38:52,269 --> 00:38:54,184
Naturally, you have
all my sympathies.

407
00:38:54,807 --> 00:38:56,452
A man that's gone
through what you have.

408
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,041
But you should need a bit of the
old readies to move around on.

409
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,767
How you placed that way?

410
00:39:02,153 --> 00:39:02,997
I'll get by.

411
00:39:03,077 --> 00:39:05,081
Of course you will.
Of course you will.

412
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:07,877
Why, you're a man who
would get by wherever you are.

413
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,955
But if you should need a little..

414
00:39:10,327 --> 00:39:12,254
Extra spondulix.

415
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,825
Just to tide you over,
sort of get you on your feet.

416
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,287
I don't need a thing.

417
00:39:16,598 --> 00:39:18,356
Here, now that ain't
exactly true you know.

418
00:39:18,845 --> 00:39:20,579
We all need a bit
more than we've got.

419
00:39:21,889 --> 00:39:25,163
But you mustn't let your temper
get the better of your judgment.

420
00:39:25,794 --> 00:39:27,572
That's been many
a good man's downfall.

421
00:39:29,098 --> 00:39:31,172
Look before you.. hit.

422
00:39:32,322 --> 00:39:33,582
That's what I always say.

423
00:39:34,187 --> 00:39:36,090
Come on, come on.
What's on your mind? Spill it.

424
00:39:36,306 --> 00:39:38,107
Ah you see, now
you're being reasonable.

425
00:39:39,816 --> 00:39:40,509
Here.

426
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:42,427
Get yourself a cup.

427
00:39:46,849 --> 00:39:48,172
You know, it seems to me..

428
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:51,743
That there are too many people walking
about these days who can afford to ride.

429
00:39:52,712 --> 00:39:54,116
Given the opportunity.

430
00:39:57,077 --> 00:39:59,135
I don't get you.
- Here, just a minute.

431
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,338
Have you ever stopped to
think about petrol coupons?

432
00:40:06,587 --> 00:40:09,867
There is a tidy little sum in it,
if you know how to handle them.

433
00:40:10,377 --> 00:40:12,899
Yeah. And there's a tidy little stretch
in the pen if you get caught.

434
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:14,962
Well of course, if you've got
something better in view.

435
00:40:15,733 --> 00:40:18,536
Like a job in an office or
behind the bars in a bank.

436
00:40:19,444 --> 00:40:21,480
Something nice and cosy.

437
00:40:22,863 --> 00:40:24,040
You know what I've got.

438
00:40:26,655 --> 00:40:27,783
Suppose it is a deal.

439
00:40:28,567 --> 00:40:32,125
Oh.. I've been waiting a long
time to hear you say that.

440
00:40:32,771 --> 00:40:34,815
Patience and luck.
That's my motto.

441
00:40:35,387 --> 00:40:36,603
That's got me where I am.

442
00:40:37,115 --> 00:40:39,576
You and me could have a
rare partnership together.

443
00:40:40,532 --> 00:40:41,834
Now let's get this straight.

444
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:45,352
All I want is a one shot deal
for a bankroll and then I blow.

445
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:48,481
You can find me at
number 7 Markwell Place.

446
00:40:50,256 --> 00:40:50,928
Seven.

447
00:40:51,452 --> 00:40:52,798
That's a lucky number, that is.

448
00:41:12,566 --> 00:41:13,410
Hello, Bill.

449
00:41:15,643 --> 00:41:18,285
I tried to find what day
you were coming out.

450
00:41:20,368 --> 00:41:21,097
You did?

451
00:41:21,366 --> 00:41:23,885
Yes, but it seems you have
to be a relative or something.

452
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,668
I thought you
had forgotten about me.

453
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,610
I thought a lot about you.

454
00:41:33,047 --> 00:41:33,774
Yeah.

455
00:41:34,586 --> 00:41:36,174
I thought how
wrong it was that you..

456
00:41:36,264 --> 00:41:37,966
You ever got mixed
up with a guy like me.

457
00:41:39,882 --> 00:41:41,641
I guess we didn't make
much sense together.

458
00:41:43,525 --> 00:41:44,885
It is very close this evening.

459
00:41:47,027 --> 00:41:48,100
It seems fine to me.

460
00:41:49,014 --> 00:41:50,201
I guess any place would.

461
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,365
Six months in there is..

462
00:41:53,057 --> 00:41:54,216
It's like a whole life.

463
00:41:54,459 --> 00:41:55,407
Good evening.

464
00:41:55,702 --> 00:41:57,021
Good evening, Mrs Gale.

465
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:02,324
Cigarette?
- No thank you.

466
00:42:05,297 --> 00:42:06,513
What have you been doing?

467
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,691
I had dinner with a girlfriend
and we went to the pictures.

468
00:42:12,252 --> 00:42:13,799
Every night?
- No.

469
00:42:18,506 --> 00:42:19,922
The building is almost finished.

470
00:42:20,697 --> 00:42:22,192
Yes, it's been a long time,

471
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,079
What are you going to do?

472
00:42:28,785 --> 00:42:29,972
Get some money together.

473
00:42:30,588 --> 00:42:31,317
Beat it.

474
00:42:31,811 --> 00:42:33,365
Beat it, where?
- Oh, I don't know.

475
00:42:33,809 --> 00:42:35,111
Canada maybe. Some place.

476
00:42:36,211 --> 00:42:37,198
Make a new start.

477
00:42:38,172 --> 00:42:40,130
They need a lorry
driver at the Institute.

478
00:42:40,486 --> 00:42:42,551
I could talk to Dr Travis
in the morning.

479
00:42:43,405 --> 00:42:44,020
You?

480
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,825
You can drive, can't you?

481
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:47,820
Yeah.. but why?

482
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:50,841
You would be out in the open
most of the time on your own.

483
00:42:51,977 --> 00:42:53,560
Wouldn't you like
that sort of a job?

484
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:55,918
I don't know why
you want to do this.

485
00:42:57,373 --> 00:42:58,903
What are you going
to them about me?

486
00:42:58,986 --> 00:43:00,116
About where I've been.

487
00:43:01,048 --> 00:43:02,865
The truth, and that you
are a friend of mine.

488
00:43:03,572 --> 00:43:05,023
It's been nice seeing you, Bill.

489
00:43:05,238 --> 00:43:06,025
Goodnight.

490
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:08,265
Goodnight.

491
00:43:26,491 --> 00:43:28,628
It sounds a little rough.
You'd better lean it up a bit.

492
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:29,694
Yeah, it needs..

493
00:43:30,563 --> 00:43:31,807
What do you know about it?

494
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:34,420
I drove an ambulance for four
years in the Fire Service.

495
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:38,914
You should have seen me. Trousers,
battle jacket, great heavy boots.

496
00:43:39,944 --> 00:43:41,012
And my language.

497
00:44:09,164 --> 00:44:10,407
How you blowing, chum?

498
00:44:12,087 --> 00:44:14,419
What are you doing here?
- Keeping you pretty busy, ain't they.

499
00:44:14,742 --> 00:44:16,136
I see you're working overtime.

500
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:18,257
Who told you?
- It's up on the board there.

501
00:44:18,944 --> 00:44:20,427
Leaving for Evesham at 8 o'clock.

502
00:44:21,937 --> 00:44:24,045
A tidy little run, eh?
- Listen, I'm busy.

503
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:27,209
All manner of things,
you're tucking away in there.

504
00:44:27,479 --> 00:44:29,150
A marvellous assortment.

505
00:44:29,619 --> 00:44:32,041
Penicillin and sulphur
drugs and who knows what.

506
00:44:33,515 --> 00:44:35,835
Here.. it's as plain as
the nose on your face.

507
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:38,285
Here is your one-shot deal right here.

508
00:44:38,549 --> 00:44:39,993
And Harry knows how to handle it.

509
00:44:41,015 --> 00:44:41,859
You do, huh?

510
00:44:42,101 --> 00:44:44,633
Of course, we couldn't pull it off
over here. But on the continent..?

511
00:44:44,728 --> 00:44:46,228
You know what it's like over there.

512
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,180
Human misery.

513
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:49,519
And do you know what goes
with misery? Suffering.

514
00:44:50,097 --> 00:44:51,427
And what goes with suffering?

515
00:44:52,198 --> 00:44:52,985
A fortune.

516
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,093
You're nuts. You'd never
get it out of the country.

517
00:44:55,173 --> 00:44:57,248
I'd get it through the gates
of heaven if I had to.

518
00:44:57,962 --> 00:44:59,091
I've got a connection.

519
00:44:59,509 --> 00:45:00,889
The Skipper of the Pelicano.

520
00:45:01,826 --> 00:45:03,115
Just arrived off Gravesend.

521
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:04,641
He'd take it.

522
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,189
And you, too.

523
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,457
I'm doing alright where I am.

524
00:45:10,891 --> 00:45:12,724
Do you know, I can't
understand you, chum.

525
00:45:13,491 --> 00:45:15,050
You seem to have
forgotten something.

526
00:45:15,774 --> 00:45:17,545
Remember what's
hanging over your head.

527
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:27,414
You took a long time
getting around to that.

528
00:45:27,775 --> 00:45:30,909
And don't forget I wasn't the only one
in the Anchor & Dolphin that night.

529
00:45:31,642 --> 00:45:33,046
You'd better see things my way.

530
00:45:33,936 --> 00:45:36,294
Why, with this under your belt,
you'll be sitting pretty.

531
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,828
Out of the country.
Your pockets lined.

532
00:45:39,395 --> 00:45:40,934
And cocking a snook at the world.

533
00:45:41,687 --> 00:45:46,563
No Harry to remind you of a thing that
happened once in the heat of the moment.

534
00:45:47,131 --> 00:45:47,746
See?

535
00:45:59,689 --> 00:46:01,085
Now take it easy, chum.

536
00:46:01,986 --> 00:46:05,554
Old Harry may not have the muscle on him
but he has what it takes just the same.

537
00:46:06,884 --> 00:46:08,615
What would happen if I
phoned the Coppers?

538
00:46:09,584 --> 00:46:10,971
They'd hang you, wouldn't they.

539
00:46:11,574 --> 00:46:12,355
Hang you.

540
00:46:14,389 --> 00:46:17,237
But of course if you want to stick to
your job we can arrange that, too.

541
00:46:18,019 --> 00:46:19,801
We'll make you look
a picture of innocence.

542
00:46:20,705 --> 00:46:21,658
Stop the truck.

543
00:46:22,086 --> 00:46:24,903
Beat you up proper scientific,
and no-one would be any the wiser.

544
00:46:25,827 --> 00:46:28,163
And you can trust me to see
that you get your money.

545
00:46:28,304 --> 00:46:29,463
I don't want any money.

546
00:46:32,371 --> 00:46:34,625
Alright.. I'll let you pull this off.

547
00:46:35,298 --> 00:46:36,943
That will square us.
You'll be paid off.

548
00:46:38,377 --> 00:46:40,250
But if you ever bother
me again, I'll kill you.

549
00:46:40,776 --> 00:46:42,564
You know, you're
cheapening yourself, chum.

550
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:45,446
Of course, if that's the way you want it.
- That's the way I want it.

551
00:46:46,443 --> 00:46:48,374
The last thing you're ever
going to want from me.

552
00:46:48,576 --> 00:46:50,507
You'll be taking the
Blackwall Tunnel, won't you?

553
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:53,391
I'll be waiting outside
the entrance at 8:30.

554
00:46:53,802 --> 00:46:55,647
I'll bring a couple of
the lads along with me.

555
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:59,046
They'll leave you looking as though
a blooming train ran right over you.

556
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:01,233
No real harm done.

557
00:47:02,766 --> 00:47:04,254
You know, their skill..

558
00:47:04,857 --> 00:47:06,453
Amazes me, sometimes.

559
00:47:08,889 --> 00:47:09,678
Look here.

560
00:47:10,684 --> 00:47:11,871
This is important to me.

561
00:47:12,507 --> 00:47:14,680
So don't play no tricks on Harry.

562
00:47:20,991 --> 00:47:23,376
After you leave the Blackwall tunnel,
take the Maidstone road.

563
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,136
You'll have no trouble finding Evesham.

564
00:47:25,513 --> 00:47:28,800
I hope they can stop this scarlet fever
before it becomes an epidemic.

565
00:47:29,487 --> 00:47:30,906
I'm sorry about this.

566
00:47:31,221 --> 00:47:34,089
I know you've had some long hours
recently, but we'll make it up to you.

567
00:47:34,437 --> 00:47:36,633
Take tomorrow off.
- Thanks.

568
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:03,922
Hello driver. Hurry and
come in out of the rain.

569
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:09,233
It's a horrid night for a long drive.

570
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,342
I don't mind.

571
00:48:10,812 --> 00:48:12,300
Want a lift? Drop you home?

572
00:48:12,935 --> 00:48:14,094
No. I'm going with you.

573
00:48:15,439 --> 00:48:18,910
But.. I thought you'd be pleased.
They're short of staff in Evesham so..

574
00:48:19,468 --> 00:48:20,368
I volunteered.

575
00:48:20,514 --> 00:48:23,224
They.. they could have sent someone
else. You've been working all day.

576
00:48:24,446 --> 00:48:26,095
Don't you want
me to go with you?

577
00:48:26,399 --> 00:48:27,438
Sure. Sure I do.

578
00:48:29,043 --> 00:48:31,515
Is anything the matter, Bill?
- No.. no.

579
00:48:32,207 --> 00:48:33,451
We'd better get started.

580
00:48:46,073 --> 00:48:48,735
You are becoming quite a popular
character around the institute.

581
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:52,124
Am I?
- Yes. Everyone likes you.

582
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:57,563
Not getting tired
of your job are you?

583
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:58,891
No. I like it.

584
00:48:59,784 --> 00:49:01,732
I thought you did.
You seemed happy.

585
00:49:04,585 --> 00:49:05,675
Not just the job.

586
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:15,401
You've never been around
Evesham before have you.

587
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,341
No. What's it like?
- Oh, it's beautiful down there.

588
00:49:18,859 --> 00:49:20,274
I guess we won't see much of it.

589
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:22,620
Here he comes.

590
00:49:31,871 --> 00:49:33,836
That man signalled us.
He seems to be in trouble.

591
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:35,023
Yeah. He did.

592
00:49:36,226 --> 00:49:37,385
I'll see what he wants.

593
00:49:42,023 --> 00:49:42,924
You wait here.

594
00:49:58,071 --> 00:50:00,777
You had me scared for a minute.
Sailing by like that.

595
00:50:01,205 --> 00:50:02,410
You splashed me, too.

596
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,139
Are these your friends?

597
00:50:04,219 --> 00:50:05,594
Felix, this is Mr Saunders.

598
00:50:05,781 --> 00:50:07,539
Pleased to meet you.
- And this is Charlie.

599
00:50:07,687 --> 00:50:09,564
Didn't I see someone
with you in the lorry?

600
00:50:09,859 --> 00:50:10,503
Yeah.

601
00:50:10,767 --> 00:50:12,901
We're not going through
with it tonight. - What's that?

602
00:50:12,981 --> 00:50:15,248
I didn't know she'd be coming along.
They needed extra help.

603
00:50:15,403 --> 00:50:16,968
"She"? You mean
the same young lady?

604
00:50:17,128 --> 00:50:19,088
I'll be carrying another
load one of these days.

605
00:50:19,168 --> 00:50:20,290
One of these days.

606
00:50:20,861 --> 00:50:23,324
The Skipper of the
Pelicano is ready tonight.

607
00:50:26,031 --> 00:50:27,397
The Skipper will have to wait.

608
00:50:27,682 --> 00:50:29,518
We'll have to rough up
the young lady, too.

609
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:32,593
Unless you leave her behind
and come along with me.

610
00:50:35,104 --> 00:50:36,291
I said it's off tonight.

611
00:51:16,715 --> 00:51:17,431
Bill!

612
00:51:18,948 --> 00:51:21,929
Oh, there you are! You were
so long and I began to worry.

613
00:51:22,836 --> 00:51:25,378
What happened?
- Nothing. The fellow lost his way.

614
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,606
Had to set him straight.

615
00:51:43,448 --> 00:51:45,551
You know what you've got to
do when you get to Evesham?

616
00:51:45,683 --> 00:51:49,442
There's a Dr Paton waiting for us. We'll
likely cope with the new cases tonight.

617
00:51:49,522 --> 00:51:51,424
And do preventative
inoculations in the morning.

618
00:51:52,028 --> 00:51:53,758
You're not going to get
much rest are you.

619
00:51:54,351 --> 00:51:55,309
Neither are you.

620
00:52:06,675 --> 00:52:09,818
Nobody thought it would spread so quick,
but the penicillin will stop it, surely.

621
00:52:10,101 --> 00:52:10,916
Can't miss.

622
00:52:10,997 --> 00:52:13,944
That's very reassuring. Believe me.
When it's your own child.

623
00:52:14,244 --> 00:52:16,118
You've got nothing to
worry about. - Thank you.

624
00:52:16,232 --> 00:52:17,305
Thank you very much.

625
00:52:17,545 --> 00:52:20,113
I don't know what Dr Paton is going
to do about that Thomas girl.

626
00:52:20,377 --> 00:52:23,195
She was the first to come down with the
fever and the doctor can't get near her.

627
00:52:23,295 --> 00:52:25,651
What's the trouble?
- It's her father, Luther Thomas.

628
00:52:25,998 --> 00:52:28,941
They lost their first to diphtheria. He
thinks it's the inoculations that did it.

629
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:30,108
Why, that's crazy.

630
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:32,204
Thomas is a good man but
he won't listen to anybody.

631
00:52:32,434 --> 00:52:33,948
He won't let the
doctor near the girl.

632
00:52:34,028 --> 00:52:35,984
Constable, you're
wanted on the telephone.

633
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:46,823
Hello?

634
00:52:51,856 --> 00:52:52,598
I see.

635
00:52:53,634 --> 00:52:54,305
Right.

636
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:57,228
Is that all there is to go, Bill?
- This is the last load.

637
00:52:57,553 --> 00:53:00,686
Dr Paton has given us a long list of
houses. We've a long, busy night ahead.

638
00:53:01,112 --> 00:53:02,909
Mrs Paton is going along
to show us the way.

639
00:53:03,487 --> 00:53:05,990
It sounds to me as if the young fellows
had a drop too much to drink.

640
00:53:06,213 --> 00:53:08,057
Put his head under the
pump and send him home.

641
00:53:25,963 --> 00:53:28,227
This one over here.
Number seven.

642
00:53:34,394 --> 00:53:36,745
Mr Thomas was quite violent
the last time the doctor called.

643
00:53:40,338 --> 00:53:41,339
What do you want?

644
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:43,375
Mr Thomas, this young
lady is from London.

645
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,055
We don't want to see anybody.
- Can't I speak to you for a moment?

646
00:53:47,205 --> 00:53:48,534
I'm not listening to anybody.

647
00:53:49,123 --> 00:53:51,471
My little girl is going to get
better without any of your help.

648
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:53,244
Get out!
- Now look, Mr Thomas.

649
00:53:53,427 --> 00:53:55,155
You too. Get out!
- Don't you think..?

650
00:54:01,235 --> 00:54:02,758
Now listen.
- Leave us alone!

651
00:54:12,316 --> 00:54:13,246
We're going in.

652
00:54:16,217 --> 00:54:17,318
Now you listen to me.

653
00:54:18,973 --> 00:54:22,158
I've seen this stuff work on hundreds
of kids. For all kinds of things.

654
00:54:23,441 --> 00:54:24,714
It will only take a minute.

655
00:54:26,177 --> 00:54:28,543
If anything happens to your
little girl, it will be your fault.

656
00:54:33,102 --> 00:54:34,032
Go on in, Jane.

657
00:54:50,568 --> 00:54:52,625
Are you rushing back for
any special reason, Bill?

658
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,058
Huh.. no, I..

659
00:54:56,479 --> 00:54:58,853
I should think you'd be in a hurry
to get home. Get some sleep.

660
00:54:58,933 --> 00:55:01,611
No, I'm not the least bit tired.
In fact, I've never felt so wide awake.

661
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:03,578
Hard work does that sometimes.

662
00:55:05,324 --> 00:55:06,972
Oh, did you ever
see anything so lovely?

663
00:55:09,141 --> 00:55:10,843
We do have the rest
of the day off, Bill.

664
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:13,892
There is some
place you'd like to go?

665
00:55:14,347 --> 00:55:16,312
No, I'd just like to stop
and look for a while.

666
00:56:12,363 --> 00:56:13,350
I love you, Jane.

667
00:56:14,032 --> 00:56:16,292
You don't know how much I love you.
- Oh, I do. I do.

668
00:56:17,705 --> 00:56:20,234
I loved you for a long
time without knowing it.

669
00:56:20,554 --> 00:56:23,394
It's just that something kept
me from thinking the same.

670
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,152
Jane.

671
00:56:28,706 --> 00:56:30,630
Not falling asleep, are you?
- Hmm.

672
00:56:31,731 --> 00:56:32,632
Just dreaming.

673
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:34,468
About us?

674
00:56:35,481 --> 00:56:36,954
I wish we could stay here forever.

675
00:56:37,258 --> 00:56:38,640
A sort-of forever, anyway.

676
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:39,996
I'll settle for that.

677
00:56:42,893 --> 00:56:44,185
It's getting kind of cool.

678
00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:48,469
Don't leave me, Bill.

679
00:56:49,133 --> 00:56:50,274
Because you're afraid.

680
00:56:50,635 --> 00:56:52,114
Afraid? Afraid of what?

681
00:56:53,562 --> 00:56:55,297
That you were
thinking of going away.

682
00:56:57,063 --> 00:56:59,096
All through our drive to Evesham, I..

683
00:56:59,884 --> 00:57:01,393
I was almost sorry I'd come along.

684
00:57:02,327 --> 00:57:03,457
Then this morning I..

685
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:08,051
That's why I wanted to stop. To tell
you how much you meant to me and..

686
00:57:08,617 --> 00:57:11,157
How you've made me begin
to think of other things.

687
00:57:11,856 --> 00:57:13,271
Just the things I had lost.

688
00:57:15,707 --> 00:57:17,074
I was thinking of going away,

689
00:57:21,206 --> 00:57:22,535
Is anything the matter, Bill?

690
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:24,597
No, it's..

691
00:57:25,356 --> 00:57:26,400
It's just that I..

692
00:57:28,522 --> 00:57:30,107
I've got no place in your life.

693
00:57:30,456 --> 00:57:31,901
I don't want to make you unhappy.

694
00:57:33,234 --> 00:57:34,091
You won't.

695
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,419
Would you go anywhere with me?

696
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:41,413
Yes, but we're
doing what we like now.

697
00:57:41,955 --> 00:57:43,201
We'll always be together.

698
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,234
Where would you want to go?

699
00:57:48,028 --> 00:57:49,043
I don't know. I..

700
00:57:53,212 --> 00:57:55,445
I don't want to go anywhere.
I just want to be with you.

701
00:58:19,068 --> 00:58:19,740
Harry.

702
00:58:22,772 --> 00:58:23,463
Harry!

703
00:58:54,524 --> 00:58:55,471
Yes?

704
00:59:06,527 --> 00:59:10,322
I hope you'll pardon this intrusion,
but I'm a friend. A friend of Bill's.

705
00:59:11,726 --> 00:59:13,675
Oh.. won't you come in?

706
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,902
Are you sure I'm not intruding?

707
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:18,129
No, not at all. Please sit down.

708
00:59:19,549 --> 00:59:20,135
Ta.

709
00:59:22,134 --> 00:59:24,885
Oh pardon me, but I use a
little hair-oil now and then.

710
00:59:27,002 --> 00:59:28,802
You still haven't told me your name.

711
00:59:29,506 --> 00:59:31,389
Harry.. Harry Carter.

712
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:34,415
Bill hasn't ever mentioned you before.

713
00:59:34,903 --> 00:59:38,062
That's just like his little ways,
isn't it. But he's a good sort, though.

714
00:59:38,851 --> 00:59:40,439
I've no need to
tell you that, though.

715
00:59:41,632 --> 00:59:43,134
I've got a soft spot for him, too.

716
00:59:44,028 --> 00:59:45,945
That's why I took the
liberty of coming to you.

717
00:59:46,755 --> 00:59:48,128
I've been troubled about him.

718
00:59:49,392 --> 00:59:50,021
Why?

719
00:59:50,499 --> 00:59:51,745
Well, it's his job.

720
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:55,153
What do you mean, exactly?
Everything is going splendidly.

721
00:59:55,374 --> 00:59:57,769
Well, in a manner of
speaking, I suppose it is.

722
00:59:59,069 --> 00:59:59,712
Here.

723
01:00:00,075 --> 01:00:02,656
I got you a little present.
With my best respects.

724
01:00:03,069 --> 01:00:05,000
I do hope you don't think
it's too forward of me.

725
01:00:05,283 --> 01:00:07,344
I'm afraid I don't understand
what you're getting at.

726
01:00:07,424 --> 01:00:10,195
They are the best on the market. Not
easy to lay your hands on, these days.

727
01:00:10,444 --> 01:00:12,406
You still haven't explained, Mr Carter.

728
01:00:12,595 --> 01:00:14,272
That's alright.
Just you call me Harry.

729
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,709
Anyway, me and Bill is partners.

730
01:00:17,244 --> 01:00:20,272
And just recently everything has
been going very well indeed.

731
01:00:21,097 --> 01:00:22,340
And then, all of a sudden.

732
01:00:22,763 --> 01:00:23,779
He goes to pieces.

733
01:00:24,934 --> 01:00:25,950
Now why, I wonder?

734
01:00:27,213 --> 01:00:30,161
I don't think for a moment that you are
a friend of Bill's. What is it you want?

735
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:32,240
You can be honest with me.

736
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:36,006
Could it be that the little
lady went for a little ride..

737
01:00:36,276 --> 01:00:38,327
And whispered
something in his ear, eh?

738
01:00:39,083 --> 01:00:40,070
What is all this?

739
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,627
All that valuable stuff at the clinic.

740
01:00:43,296 --> 01:00:44,455
We had it all sewed up.

741
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,964
I was going to make the arrangements
and he was going to make the deliveries.

742
01:00:50,426 --> 01:00:52,619
If you don't get out of here,
I shall call the Police.

743
01:00:52,859 --> 01:00:55,632
If I were you young lady,
I'd ask Bill's permission first.

744
01:00:56,058 --> 01:00:58,531
If Bill were here, he'd take you
by the scruff of your neck and..

745
01:00:58,675 --> 01:00:59,662
And chuck me out?

746
01:01:00,335 --> 01:01:03,824
You put me in a really awkward position.
I don't know quite where to begin.

747
01:01:04,772 --> 01:01:07,868
Supposing we go back about
eight months. A Tuesday night.

748
01:01:08,459 --> 01:01:10,916
At the Anchor & Dolphin.
Ever heard of the place?

749
01:01:12,851 --> 01:01:13,695
Yes, I have.

750
01:01:13,833 --> 01:01:16,316
Well, it was just on closing
time. I was drinking up.

751
01:01:16,857 --> 01:01:18,473
And all of a sudden,
there was trouble.

752
01:01:19,172 --> 01:01:22,355
The next thing I know, there
was a man lying dead on the floor.

753
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,353
Bill had killed him.

754
01:01:25,234 --> 01:01:26,993
Bill didn't kill him.
He told me he didn't.

755
01:01:27,302 --> 01:01:28,815
He ran away
because he jumped ship.

756
01:01:29,056 --> 01:01:30,408
The Police wouldn't think so.

757
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:32,028
You are lying.

758
01:01:32,581 --> 01:01:34,008
The Police would believe me.

759
01:01:35,234 --> 01:01:36,339
And the barmaid.

760
01:01:38,785 --> 01:01:40,569
But it's safe with me, Janey.

761
01:01:41,263 --> 01:01:43,719
Because you're going to
work with us, aren't you.

762
01:01:44,187 --> 01:01:45,539
That's all I'm here for.

763
01:01:46,177 --> 01:01:47,746
Just a little cooperation.

764
01:01:48,005 --> 01:01:50,226
Everything smooth and friendly.

765
01:01:51,135 --> 01:01:52,592
No more misunderstandings.

766
01:01:53,556 --> 01:01:57,529
No more leaving Harry standing
in the rain next time, eh Janey?

767
01:01:58,333 --> 01:01:59,842
You and I will see to that.

768
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:02,450
Just good friends.
- Don't touch me.

769
01:02:04,683 --> 01:02:06,440
You ought to know
better than that.

770
01:02:08,748 --> 01:02:10,091
But it's alright.

771
01:02:11,312 --> 01:02:12,184
It's only me.

772
01:02:13,722 --> 01:02:14,458
Harry.

773
01:02:17,424 --> 01:02:19,609
But I'm going to
run things from now on.

774
01:02:21,725 --> 01:02:23,770
And when I raise my thumb
you're going to jump to it.

775
01:02:23,926 --> 01:02:24,639
No!

776
01:02:25,285 --> 01:02:25,957
Happy.

777
01:02:26,828 --> 01:02:27,654
Together.

778
01:02:28,946 --> 01:02:30,580
Nice and cosy.

779
01:02:50,421 --> 01:02:51,437
Any trouble, Miss?

780
01:03:17,738 --> 01:03:18,571
Bill.

781
01:03:19,878 --> 01:03:20,741
Bill.

782
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:24,177
Jane.

783
01:03:25,374 --> 01:03:26,806
What's wrong? What happened?

784
01:03:41,763 --> 01:03:42,978
Tell me Jane. What is it?

785
01:03:43,797 --> 01:03:44,526
Tell me.

786
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:48,353
He came in and startled me.
He said he was a friend of yours.

787
01:03:49,627 --> 01:03:51,950
He started talking about you.
He said his name was Harry.

788
01:03:53,111 --> 01:03:55,682
He said you killed that man at the
Anchor & Dolphin. And then he..

789
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:57,435
He tried to make me think that..

790
01:03:58,369 --> 01:04:01,869
And then he came close to me and he
put his hands on me. And I stabbed him.

791
01:04:05,124 --> 01:04:05,853
Stabbed?

792
01:04:06,115 --> 01:04:07,497
I think I killed him.

793
01:04:10,547 --> 01:04:11,486
Jane, tell me.

794
01:04:12,282 --> 01:04:13,526
You left him in your room?

795
01:04:14,087 --> 01:04:15,949
When he fell down,
I just walked out.

796
01:04:19,514 --> 01:04:20,775
What have I done to you?

797
01:04:28,403 --> 01:04:29,218
Look, Jane.

798
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,310
I'm going now.
- Going where?

799
01:04:31,499 --> 01:04:33,573
I'll be back soon.
- Can't I go with you? - No.

800
01:04:33,743 --> 01:04:35,836
It's just for just a little while.
You must wait here.

801
01:04:35,916 --> 01:04:37,302
You've got to do as I tell you.

802
01:04:38,676 --> 01:04:39,427
Alright.

803
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:43,253
Bill.

804
01:04:47,602 --> 01:04:48,646
You just wait here.

805
01:04:50,598 --> 01:04:51,871
Everything will be alright.

806
01:05:24,093 --> 01:05:25,137
I'm hurt, chum.

807
01:05:26,098 --> 01:05:27,187
She hurt me bad.

808
01:05:33,683 --> 01:05:34,899
But I ain't going to die.

809
01:05:35,395 --> 01:05:36,524
I've stopped bleeding.

810
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,135
No, you're not going to die.
Not here anyway.

811
01:05:40,847 --> 01:05:43,483
Get me a doctor, chum.
- I'll get one when we're out of here.

812
01:05:43,645 --> 01:05:45,102
No.. I'm not leaving.

813
01:05:45,182 --> 01:05:47,153
You'll be right if you don't
waste too much time.

814
01:05:47,233 --> 01:05:47,896
No.

815
01:05:47,976 --> 01:05:50,364
Get up, or I'll finish the job.
- No! - Get up.

816
01:05:53,145 --> 01:05:55,008
Here.. where are you taking me?

817
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:56,582
I'm taking you home.

818
01:05:56,978 --> 01:05:58,942
I don't want to hear a sound
out of you until we get there.

819
01:06:15,517 --> 01:06:17,047
Here. Keep the change.
- Thank you.

820
01:06:19,576 --> 01:06:22,360
He's had a skin-full, ain't he.
- Yeah.

821
01:06:22,574 --> 01:06:25,493
By the time he's slept it off he won't
remember a blooming thing tomorrow.

822
01:06:25,843 --> 01:06:27,318
I guess not.
- Goodbye, chum.

823
01:06:27,652 --> 01:06:28,439
Goodnight.

824
01:06:51,601 --> 01:06:52,559
Better lie down.

825
01:06:54,403 --> 01:06:56,655
Now.. I'm alright now.

826
01:06:59,295 --> 01:07:00,562
I could use a drink.

827
01:07:06,757 --> 01:07:08,116
I'm going to get you a doctor.

828
01:07:09,027 --> 01:07:10,299
And you're going to tell..

829
01:07:11,459 --> 01:07:12,893
You'll get me a doctor.

830
01:07:13,835 --> 01:07:15,366
I'll have a quicker way to get help.

831
01:07:16,281 --> 01:07:18,482
That girl and you
double-crossing me.

832
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:21,022
I'll tell you what
I'll tell the Coppers.

833
01:07:21,873 --> 01:07:23,576
I was paying her a friendly visit.

834
01:07:24,358 --> 01:07:25,459
And she stabbed me.

835
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,004
Yeah.. the law will..

836
01:07:28,717 --> 01:07:29,761
Deal hard with her.

837
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:35,023
If I die.

838
01:07:36,389 --> 01:07:37,718
They'll hang the pair of you.

839
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:21,357
Where can I find the
Skipper of the Pelicano?

840
01:08:21,467 --> 01:08:22,454
Up on the bridge.

841
01:08:26,703 --> 01:08:27,690
What do you want?

842
01:08:29,914 --> 01:08:31,753
A passage for two
and no questions asked.

843
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:34,400
You have the wrong ship, mister.

844
01:08:34,918 --> 01:08:36,082
We carry cargo.

845
01:08:41,994 --> 01:08:43,549
We still carry cargo.

846
01:08:48,455 --> 01:08:49,209
Enough?

847
01:08:52,025 --> 01:08:53,902
No.
It's all I've got.

848
01:08:56,824 --> 01:08:58,257
What about the other party?

849
01:08:59,245 --> 01:09:00,117
It's a woman.

850
01:09:00,839 --> 01:09:01,568
My wife.

851
01:09:02,214 --> 01:09:03,483
It's not worth the risk.

852
01:09:08,536 --> 01:09:09,723
I'm a friend of Harry's.

853
01:09:11,422 --> 01:09:13,412
I know a lot of Harrys.
- You know this one.

854
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:15,310
He had a deal with you.

855
01:09:24,177 --> 01:09:25,135
What went wrong?

856
01:09:26,614 --> 01:09:27,715
He couldn't swing it.

857
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,331
Could you?

858
01:09:34,949 --> 01:09:36,669
It might make a lot of difference.

859
01:09:38,148 --> 01:09:39,507
It's too tough. I can't do it.

860
01:09:40,067 --> 01:09:40,728
Why?

861
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:42,523
Isn't she worth it?

862
01:09:45,426 --> 01:09:47,682
It is 10:24.
I have my sailing orders.

863
01:09:48,524 --> 01:09:50,239
I have to be out
of the harbour by 12.

864
01:09:50,704 --> 01:09:51,948
You think you can make it?

865
01:11:00,769 --> 01:11:02,312
"Hello, Janey."

866
01:11:05,659 --> 01:11:07,368
"It was in the Anchor & Dolphin."

867
01:11:08,559 --> 01:11:09,851
"Ever heard of the place?"

868
01:11:11,213 --> 01:11:13,661
"A man is lying dead on the floor. "

869
01:11:14,723 --> 01:11:15,972
"Bill had killed him. "

870
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:21,995
"No more leaving Harry standing
in the rain, next time, eh Janey?"

871
01:11:23,728 --> 01:11:25,660
"The Police will believe me. "

872
01:11:26,881 --> 01:11:28,348
"And the barmaid. "

873
01:11:30,089 --> 01:11:31,506
"It's only me. "

874
01:11:32,403 --> 01:11:33,158
"Harry. "

875
01:11:34,551 --> 01:11:35,280
"Harry. "

876
01:11:36,182 --> 01:11:37,068
"Together. "

877
01:11:38,231 --> 01:11:40,424
"Nice and cosy. "

878
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:40,636
Jane.. Jane.

879
01:13:41,881 --> 01:13:43,326
Oh, I thought I'd never find you.

880
01:13:44,166 --> 01:13:44,976
Why did you leave the room?

881
01:13:45,056 --> 01:13:47,451
I am so glad to see you.
I was so afraid I..

882
01:13:48,488 --> 01:13:50,650
I thought I heard
Harry's voice, but I..

883
01:13:52,933 --> 01:13:53,776
Jane, look.

884
01:13:54,488 --> 01:13:55,561
I went to your room.

885
01:13:55,928 --> 01:13:56,990
Harry wasn't there.

886
01:13:57,346 --> 01:14:00,106
You couldn't have done more than scratch
the guy as he got free, and ran away.

887
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:01,758
He wasn't there?

888
01:14:02,137 --> 01:14:03,464
No. He wasn't there.

889
01:14:05,053 --> 01:14:06,214
Oh, thank goodness.

890
01:14:07,089 --> 01:14:09,365
But he may have gone
to the Police about you.

891
01:14:09,627 --> 01:14:11,179
Jane, look.
We don't have much time.

892
01:14:11,928 --> 01:14:14,317
There is a ship leaving for Lisbon
tonight. We can still make it.

893
01:14:14,397 --> 01:14:16,690
We'll go to Canada, the States.
Any place we can be alone.

894
01:14:16,833 --> 01:14:19,190
Where people will let us alone.
We'll be together. Will you go?

895
01:14:19,828 --> 01:14:21,976
Yes. All I want to
do is be with you.

896
01:14:22,278 --> 01:14:23,637
Alright, come on. Let's hurry.

897
01:14:58,722 --> 01:14:59,394
Funny.

898
01:15:01,117 --> 01:15:02,533
Every headlight is a Police car.

899
01:15:03,219 --> 01:15:04,292
I'm sure it's a Cop.

900
01:15:05,704 --> 01:15:06,863
But they won't stop us.

901
01:15:07,773 --> 01:15:08,904
Nobody will stop us.

902
01:15:28,381 --> 01:15:29,511
It's full of supplies.

903
01:15:30,502 --> 01:15:31,829
No. They are empty cartons.

904
01:15:38,652 --> 01:15:39,553
We'll make it.

905
01:15:42,047 --> 01:15:43,063
What's the matter?

906
01:15:43,197 --> 01:15:44,962
What are you thinking about?
- It's cold.

907
01:15:45,885 --> 01:15:46,843
Take my coat.

908
01:16:15,462 --> 01:16:18,038
Jane. - I killed him.
- Jane, please. - I did, I did.

909
01:16:18,342 --> 01:16:20,234
He was no good, it wasn't
your fault. - I killed him.

910
01:16:26,205 --> 01:16:27,652
I can't go.
- You've got to.

911
01:16:27,891 --> 01:16:31,585
No, Bill. I've never loved anyone
so much, ever. But I can't go.

912
01:16:31,783 --> 01:16:33,026
What do you want us to do?

913
01:16:33,216 --> 01:16:34,755
I've got to go back.
- What for?

914
01:16:35,118 --> 01:16:36,377
No-one can prove anything.

915
01:16:36,457 --> 01:16:38,496
No-one has to prove anything.
I know what I've done.

916
01:16:39,305 --> 01:16:41,150
What have you done that
I haven't made you do?

917
01:16:41,409 --> 01:16:43,140
You haven't done anything.
- Bill, please.

918
01:16:43,745 --> 01:16:45,532
You can say it was
self-defence and get off.

919
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:47,958
But if I go back I won't get off.
I'll be sticking my head in a rope.

920
01:16:48,038 --> 01:16:49,208
Is that what you want?

921
01:16:49,288 --> 01:16:51,878
No. That man at the Anchor & Dolphin.
That was an accident, was it?

922
01:16:51,958 --> 01:16:53,601
Maybe it was.
Maybe I meant to kill him.

923
01:16:53,904 --> 01:16:55,012
There's a difference.

924
01:16:55,092 --> 01:16:56,962
Who's going to believe that?
- They might understand.

925
01:16:57,042 --> 01:16:59,276
Listen, no-one gives anybody
a break. Not me, anyway.

926
01:16:59,861 --> 01:17:01,352
Run, run, run. All the time.

927
01:17:01,666 --> 01:17:03,769
Run from my old man.
Run from the kid I hurt in school.

928
01:17:03,909 --> 01:17:06,497
That's why I didn't mind the Army.
When you hit, you didn't have to run.

929
01:17:06,801 --> 01:17:08,332
Everybody is against you. Everybody!

930
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:11,034
I'm not, Bill. I love you.

931
01:17:14,258 --> 01:17:15,445
Then listen to me, Jane.

932
01:17:16,724 --> 01:17:17,768
We'll find a place.

933
01:17:18,459 --> 01:17:21,090
It won't be the sort of life we
planned this afternoon on the hill.

934
01:17:22,264 --> 01:17:23,880
We will, we will. We'll have that, too.

935
01:17:24,814 --> 01:17:26,213
We'll b alone. Well be hunted.

936
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,106
There is nothing else.

937
01:17:29,977 --> 01:17:31,708
Do you think it's just
the man in the pub?

938
01:17:31,788 --> 01:17:34,771
The stuff in the truck is drugs alright.
I stole them to pay for our passage.

939
01:17:35,708 --> 01:17:36,809
Jane, don't leave me!

940
01:17:37,105 --> 01:17:37,863
Don't go.

941
01:17:44,245 --> 01:17:45,270
I need you.

942
01:17:47,022 --> 01:17:47,979
Oh, I need you.

943
01:17:52,779 --> 01:17:54,327
I don't know what's best for you.

944
01:17:55,115 --> 01:17:56,016
All I know is.

945
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:58,748
What I can't do is I can't run
away from the thing I've done.

946
01:17:59,836 --> 01:18:01,820
And I know I don't
want to live without you.

947
01:18:07,538 --> 01:18:09,011
I didn't want to be alone anymore.

948
01:18:11,487 --> 01:18:12,816
I don't want to be alone now.

949
01:18:14,807 --> 01:18:15,835
If we go back.

950
01:18:16,883 --> 01:18:17,984
If we stick together.

951
01:18:18,887 --> 01:18:19,800
If we face it.

952
01:18:21,307 --> 01:18:22,408
Do you think that..?

953
01:18:23,064 --> 01:18:24,114
Maybe somewhere.

954
01:18:25,118 --> 01:18:26,218
Somebody will listen.

955
01:18:27,242 --> 01:18:29,166
Somebody will say it
wasn't all our fault?

956
01:18:31,654 --> 01:18:32,699
Not yours anyway.

957
01:18:43,598 --> 01:18:44,957
Maybe they'll give us a break.

958
01:18:46,428 --> 01:18:47,471
Maybe they won't.

959
01:18:49,088 --> 01:18:51,120
We'll see.
