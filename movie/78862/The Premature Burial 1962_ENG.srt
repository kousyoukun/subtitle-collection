1
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,712
Good afternoon, Miss Gault.

2
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,981
Good afternoon, Judson.
I'd like to see--

3
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,017
Hello, Kate.

4
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,491
What do you Want?

5
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,494
Will you tell Guy that
I Would like to see him?

6
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,254
I'm afraid he doesn't
Wish to see you.

7
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,733
I shall have to hear
that from Guy himself.

8
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,260
Oh, really, Kate,
don't you think...

9
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,101
at least I deserve
an explanation?

10
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,270
Very Well.

11
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,275
Will you please Wait here?

12
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,743
I'm sorry.

13
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,009
Guy does not Wish to see you.

14
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:45,407
I told you I'd have to hear
that from Guy himself.

15
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,316
Guy?

16
00:04:58,564 --> 00:04:59,792
Emily.

17
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,363
Emily, you--

18
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,202
you shouldn't have come here.

19
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,605
So I understand.

20
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,037
But, Guy, don't you think
I deserve something...

21
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,909
a little more than a letter?

22
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,614
Look at me and tell me
you don't love me.

23
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,053
My darling,
I do love you--very much.

24
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,283
That's Why I sent you
that letter...

25
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,622
because I do love you.

26
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,959
NoW, darling, please go aWay
and forget you ever met me.

27
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,890
I know what happened, Guy.

28
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,801
My father told me.

29
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,106
Did he tell you Why?

30
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,801
Despite what he thinks...

31
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,141
I didn't run aWay from What
Was inside that coffin...

32
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,670
but from What I kneW
to be inside me.

33
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,240
I--I don't understand.

34
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,979
I'd hoped to spare you this.

35
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,818
If you do understand,
then you'll realize...

36
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,381
Why there can never be
a marriage betWeen us.

37
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,859
Come With me.

38
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,533
Where does this lead?

39
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:19,670
Below.

40
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,015
Are you all right?

41
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,022
Yes, I--I think so.

42
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,155
Do you Want to go back?

43
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,426
No. No.

44
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,936
You've often expressed a Wish
to meet the rest of my family.

45
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,409
Well, here they are--

46
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,677
all my ancestors,
famous and infamous...

47
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:32,616
Iaid here to--
What is the term?

48
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:33,812
To rest.

49
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,321
From the beginning,
death has come...

50
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,987
to the Carrells
like an assassin...

51
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,521
but the least fortunate
of all Was my father.

52
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:47,863
How did he die?

53
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:52,803
Like a single candle
in a dark and airless room.

54
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:54,662
Emily, my father--

55
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:55,867
Guy.

56
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,036
Kate, Why are you here?

57
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:00,670
It's time for your medicine.

58
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:03,147
Oh, yes. I'd forgotten.
I'm sorry. Thank you.

59
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,376
What medicine?

60
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,983
Laudanum.

61
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,221
Guy, is this the cause of--

62
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,786
No. Not a cause. An effect.

63
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,354
Without it, I couldn't sleep.

64
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,400
Guy, tell me.

65
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,769
I should never have gone
With your father...

66
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,297
and those other doctors
that night.

67
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,209
I'm interested only
in private research.

68
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,009
I can never forget
that poor Wretch...

69
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,480
Whose grave they robbed.

70
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,414
His staring eyes...

71
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,183
his clutching hands...

72
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,656
his fingernails
broken and bloody...

73
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,283
from the vain attempt
to claW aWay...

74
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:48,759
the lid of that coffin.

75
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:53,498
You see, all this has
a special meaning for me, Emily.

76
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,694
For years,
I've lived in dread...

77
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,601
of being buried alive.

78
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,238
Can you possibly conceive it?

79
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,641
The unendurable
oppression of the lungs...

80
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:12,545
the stifling fumes
of the damp earth...

81
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,281
the rigid embrace
of the coffin...

82
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,881
the blackness
of absolute night...

83
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:20,891
and the silence...

84
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,229
Iike an overwhelming sea.

85
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:28,527
And then,
invisible in the darkness...

86
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,696
but all too hideously real
to the other senses--

87
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,535
the presence
of the conqueror Worm.

88
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,734
Guy!

89
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,303
I'm sorry.

90
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,714
These are just morbid fantasies.

91
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,081
I'm afraid not.

92
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:47,517
Every member of my family...

93
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:50,579
has met With a violent
and horrible death.

94
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,420
I noW Wait my turn.

95
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,619
HoW did your father die?

96
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,355
Catalepsy.

97
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,987
Do you knoW What that is?

98
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,032
When it strikes...

99
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:06,334
the victim gives every
outWard sign of being dead.

100
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,933
But he's not dead. He's alive.

101
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,506
I Was barely 13
When my father Was stricken.

102
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,381
Doctor said
it was a heart attack...

103
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:19,714
and there Was a funeral...

104
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,752
and he Was sealed in this vault.

105
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,520
That night...

106
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,759
I heard him crying out--

107
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,822
a pitiful, desperate cry.

108
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,697
I begged With them.
I pleaded With them.

109
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,430
"He's alive.
He's alive," I said...

110
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,267
but no one would believe me.

111
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,000
Because it wasn't true.

112
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,234
It was!

113
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:48,877
I heard him.

114
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:50,712
In your mind.

115
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,047
No, Kate.

116
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:55,018
It Would be easier
for me to accept that.

117
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,179
But I know the truth.

118
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,691
God help me,
I knoW the truth!

119
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:19,600
My father's inheritance
and my Wedding gift to you--

120
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:20,805
catalepsy.

121
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,644
NoW you knoW Why
I asked your forgiveness.

122
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,945
There's nothing to forgive.

123
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,144
But you must understand--

124
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,743
I understand
that I love you...

125
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,152
and that I Want
to be your Wife.

126
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,314
Miss Gault...

127
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,890
My brother is ill.

128
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,790
Then I shall nurse him
back to health.

129
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:35,885
Emily--

130
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,759
Guy, if you love me--
if you really love me--

131
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,492
you Won't shut me out
of your life.

132
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,261
You'll let me share it With you.

133
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,360
You Want that?

134
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,302
After What you've heard?

135
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,370
More than ever before.

136
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,108
Tell her, Guy.

137
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,040
Tell her.

138
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,009
Kate...

139
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,516
you've been most considerate...

140
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,548
and you've alWays
thought of my Welfare.

141
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,059
That is true.

142
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:11,188
But in some things,
I must make my oWn decisions.

143
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,390
Of course.

144
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,698
Then I take it you have
made your decision?

145
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,765
I have.

146
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,735
Then let it be
on your oWn head.

147
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,414
Do you, Guy...

148
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:40,323
take Emily to be your
lawful Wedded Wife...

149
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,522
for better, for Worse,
in sickness and in health...

150
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,496
So long as ye both shall live?

151
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,759
I do.

152
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,632
Do you, Emily, take Guy...

153
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,431
to be your lawful
Wedded husband...

154
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,062
for better, for Worse...

155
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,629
in sickness and in health...

156
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,903
So long as ye both shall live?

157
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,068
I do.

158
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,704
If there be any here
Who knoW just cause...

159
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,010
Why these tWo should
not be joined together...

160
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,379
in holy matrimony...

161
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,317
Iet him speak noW
or forever hold his peace.

162
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,924
The ring, please.

163
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,454
Repeat after me.

164
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:21,193
With this ring, I thee Wed.

165
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:29,736
Then I do pronounce you
man and wife.

166
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,545
Champagne, Lady Catherine?

167
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:43,612
Thank you.

168
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,815
Oh, yes, a beautiful ceremony.

169
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,487
A toast...to the most
beautiful bride...

170
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,793
and the most fortunate
groom Who ever lived.

171
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,857
May they be happy
to the end of their days.

172
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,763
No, Guy. Not in front
of everyone.

173
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,342
Well, then, you'd better
go and play something...

174
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,571
before I lose control
completely.

175
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,246
Isn't she beautiful?

176
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,443
Very.

177
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,653
Are you enjoying
yourself, father?

178
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,852
Hmm?

179
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,787
Don't stop playing, Emily.
It's lovely.

180
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,827
I Want to Wish you
every happiness.

181
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,503
Thank you, Miles.

182
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,407
You're going to Venice...

183
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,272
for the honeymoon, I understand.

184
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,843
What Was that? I--I'm sorry.

185
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,479
I inquired if you Were going
to Venice for your honeymoon...

186
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,078
and I'm not accustomed
to people--

187
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,417
Carrell!

188
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,429
Forgive me, please.

189
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,064
What the devil's
the matter With the fella?

190
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,567
-Emily.
-Yes, darling?

191
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:08,072
That melody you're playing--
What is it?

192
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,575
"Molly Malone."
Don't you like it?

193
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,941
No. Please stop playing.

194
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,775
But it's a charming melody.

195
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:16,508
I said please stop playing it!

196
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,414
I'm sorry. I...

197
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,420
Is there anything I can do, Guy?

198
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:31,622
No, nothing.

199
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:32,631
I'll come With you, Guy.

200
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:33,757
No. Please leave me alone!

201
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,324
All of you,
leave me alone, please!

202
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,343
Guy. Guy, darling.

203
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:23,371
Please Wake up.
They've all gone noW.

204
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,275
Yes, Emily.

205
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,187
Are you feeling better?

206
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,184
I think so.

207
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,920
What's the matter, Guy?

208
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,698
What happened to you doWn there?

209
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,998
I can't remember, exactly.

210
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,371
I Was talking With
your father, and then--

211
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:48,532
And then What?

212
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:50,866
The music.

213
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,070
Something about the music
you Were playing.

214
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,444
What Was it about the music?

215
00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:00,009
It Was the tune
he Was Whistling that night.

216
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,485
Who Was?

217
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,748
There were two of them.

218
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,884
Sweeney and Mole
Were their names.

219
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:09,587
Oh, filthy,
disgusting creatures.

220
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:12,392
They Were the ones
Who opened the grave...

221
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:16,333
and all the time Whistling
that loathsome tune.

222
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:18,731
Darling...

223
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,539
Now we're alone.

224
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,566
Alone.

225
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,767
Just the tWo of us.

226
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,276
Together.

227
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,349
What Was that?

228
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,152
I don't know.

229
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,256
It sounded like a scream.

230
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,492
Stay here.

231
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,970
King.

232
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,537
King, old felloW.

233
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:44,713
He is dead.

234
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,049
It must have been the lightning.

235
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,713
We'll bury him.

236
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:53,952
As you Wish.

237
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,057
NoW let us go in
out of the rain, Guy.

238
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,505
Why, he Was only stunned.

239
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,713
I Was going to bury him.

240
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:17,508
Guy.

241
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,012
I Was going to bury him...

242
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,249
alive!

243
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,025
Sketching? Out here?

244
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,587
No, not sketching, really.

245
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:33,893
Making plans.

246
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,422
For the house?

247
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,964
You're very inquisitive.

248
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,698
Well, I'm married noW...

249
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,706
and Wives are supposed
to be inquisitive.

250
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,265
And husbands are
Supposed to be secretive.

251
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,243
HoWever, I'll tell you
one of my secrets--

252
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,143
a very closely guarded one.

253
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,638
I possess the ability to kiss
a Woman Without touching her.

254
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,878
Oh, Guy, really.

255
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,320
You don't believe me?
I'll Wager you a shilling.

256
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,550
All right.

257
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,285
I'll accept your wager.

258
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:03,385
Come on. ShoW me this miracle.

259
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,396
With pleasure.

260
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,729
There you are.

261
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,104
What about your Wager?

262
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,107
Oh, I lose the Wager.

263
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,342
Here's your shilling.

264
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,069
It Was Worth much more,
believe me.

265
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,844
Guy.

266
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,112
Yes, dear?

267
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,816
What about our honeymoon?

268
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,820
You promised you'd take me
to Venice, remember?

269
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,327
Aren't you happy here?

270
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:37,851
Oh, yes, of course...

271
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:41,093
but, Well, you're
on your oWn so much...

272
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,431
and I Worry about you.

273
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,130
You must be patient With me.

274
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:48,836
All right.

275
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:49,841
In the meantime...

276
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,070
I'll brighten up
that dreary old house.

277
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:54,506
There.

278
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,580
Look. Aren't they lovely?

279
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,244
Take them aWay!

280
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:03,379
Guy, don't be so ill-tempered.

281
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,185
I can't bear living in
a house Without floWers...

282
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,190
and neither should you.

283
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:07,020
Just throW them aWay!

284
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,084
I loathe flowers.

285
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:10,287
You must promise
never to bring...

286
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,695
those sickly funeral
decorations into the house.

287
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:13,698
Guy, I Was only--

288
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:14,892
You must promise!

289
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,662
All right.

290
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:20,998
I promise.

291
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,804
Milady?

292
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,815
Yes, Judson.

293
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,612
Dr. Archer has arrived, milady.

294
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,118
Oh. ShoW him in, please.

295
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,832
-This Way, sir.
-Thank you, Judson.

296
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,230
Emily.

297
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,606
Miles, dear,
hoW kind of you to come.

298
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:58,040
I came directly.
I received your message.

299
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,236
Is something Wrong?

300
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:00,301
Yes.

301
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,578
Guy is ill.

302
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:04,946
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

303
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,348
I suppose
it's the Italian climate.

304
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,285
But We didn't go to Italy.

305
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,287
But I thought--

306
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:10,288
We've been here in this house...

307
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,119
ever since the day
We Were married.

308
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,753
I don't understand.

309
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,226
Neither do I.

310
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,996
All I knoW is that Guy is ill...

311
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:22,295
and you've got
to help him, Miles.

312
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,562
My dear, surely your father...

313
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,433
has done everything
that can be done.

314
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,869
My father has done nothing.

315
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,965
To him, Guy is
a perfectly healthy man...

316
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:31,908
but that isn't true...

317
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,776
and you must do something
to help him, Miles.

318
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,407
If you don't, something
terrible Will happen.

319
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,883
He's a completely changed man.

320
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,818
I don't even recognize him.

321
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,483
Well, I'll do Whatever I can.

322
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,385
Why don't you take me to him?

323
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,594
Thank you, Miles.

324
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,028
I'll just get my wrap.

325
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,189
Your Wrap?

326
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:55,028
It's chilly on the moors.

327
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:02,395
Emily...

328
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:04,970
Where is he?

329
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:06,733
There.

330
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,175
He started building it
a month ago.

331
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:26,690
Guy?

332
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:30,728
Yes?

333
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,066
Let me in.

334
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,231
Go aWay. I'm busy.

335
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,636
Guy, please open the door.

336
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:39,542
Emily, didn't you
understand me? I said I--

337
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,671
Hello, Guy.

338
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:44,045
Hello, Miles.
I'm glad to see you.

339
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:47,516
I must apologize.
I Was very rude.

340
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:50,020
Yes, Guy, you Were.
Very rude.

341
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:51,989
You see, I've been quite ill.

342
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:53,650
So I understand.

343
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:56,252
Guy, I have brought
Miles along...

344
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:57,852
to see if he can help you.

345
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:01,859
That's very solicitous,
but quite unnecessary.

346
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,629
I'm helping myself now.

347
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:04,657
HoW, Guy?

348
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:05,795
How?

349
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,838
Come inside. I'll shoW you.

350
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,617
This is it--

351
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,760
my grand plan.

352
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:32,964
What shall it be?

353
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:35,762
Some liqueur, brandy,
amontillado?

354
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,435
Guy, I brought--

355
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:53,547
NoW, let us drink
to something appropriate--

356
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:54,745
To death.

357
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:58,814
Not drinking?

358
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,655
What a pity.
It's really quite good.

359
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:02,921
Guy.

360
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:05,361
Yes, my dear?

361
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,024
You Wish to say something?

362
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,657
No.

363
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,689
Well, in that case...

364
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,531
Iet me tell you
about my latest addition.

365
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,868
I thought of it
the night before last.

366
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,169
Of course, it's highly
unlikely I shall ever use it...

367
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,175
but one never knoWs, does one?

368
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,912
Permits of easy egress...

369
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,113
and it's completely
impassable from the outside.

370
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:31,020
A simple arrangement,
I grant, but effective.

371
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,548
Guy, this is madness.

372
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:39,428
Madness? It's the only
Sane ansWer to my problem.

373
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:41,898
I'll shoW you just hoW mad I am.

374
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:47,931
I suppose she's told you
my father Was a cataleptic?

375
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,497
No, but that doesn't mean that--

376
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:52,408
And I am prone
to the same affliction.

377
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,968
Very Well.

378
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:56,480
Let us consider the folloWing.

379
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:59,312
Apropos of nothing at all,
I have an attack.

380
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,148
Let us say it happens
during dinner.

381
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:04,053
Emily sends Judson
to fetch a doctor.

382
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,989
The doctor arrives,
he examines me...

383
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,184
and pronounces me dead.

384
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:08,624
I am, of course, alive.

385
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,628
You knoW the nature
of catalepsy.

386
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:14,689
But to the rest
of the World, I am gone--

387
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,793
passed on, deceased.

388
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,565
So a funeral is held...

389
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,539
and I'm brought
doWn here to this vault...

390
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,633
and placed in this coffin.

391
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:35,017
The mourners have departed...

392
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:36,748
the doors are both locked...

393
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,085
and I'm alone.

394
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,555
NoW, pay close attention.

395
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,311
NoW, the slightest
movement of my finger...

396
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,146
caused that to happen.

397
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,982
I am noW free
of the casket...

398
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,750
but I'm still capable
of only slight effort.

399
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,280
So...

400
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:20,592
"But," you say, "supposing
no one hears the bell?"

401
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:23,465
The departing mourners
lock both the doors.

402
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,511
But is that REALLY foolproof?

403
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,541
What if the gate should stick?

404
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,322
You see?

405
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,427
But, of course,
it's barely possible...

406
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,993
that all these methods
might fail.

407
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,026
So...

408
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,401
But tools break, too,
don't they?

409
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,221
A recent invention by
a Swedish chemist named Nobel.

410
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,813
It's called dynamite.

411
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,154
It's an explosive.

412
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,317
But hoW can one be sure
the stuff Will Work?

413
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,786
One can't, of course.

414
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,459
So...

415
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,966
one has a bit of food...

416
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,204
Something to drink...

417
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,707
every five
or ten minutes or so...

418
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,371
rings the bell.

419
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:43,471
Reads a periodical
or perhaps a book.

420
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,949
In the event the strain
becomes too great...

421
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:48,976
one can avail oneself With
the soothing effects of music.

422
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,286
And then one simply Waits.

423
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,856
Rather Well thought out,
don't you think?

424
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,488
But no plan is ever perfect.

425
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,758
So noW comes
the "piece de resistance"...

426
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,530
or perhaps one should say
the "coup de grace."

427
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,678
What is it, Guy?

428
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:21,810
What is it?

429
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:25,287
The cure for all suffering.

430
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,757
The answer to all problems.

431
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,987
The key, my darling,
to heaven...

432
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:31,859
or to hell...

433
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,727
or to nothingness.

434
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,228
Poison.

435
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,737
Thank you, Judson.

436
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:48,609
Tea is ready in
the dining room, milady.

437
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:49,635
Thank you.

438
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,712
HoW do you explain it, Miles?

439
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,583
Well, I don't just yet.

440
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,815
HoWever, I venture to guess...

441
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,847
that the episode
at the cemetery...

442
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:03,258
changed the general fear
into a specific obsession.

443
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:04,852
Then...

444
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:06,523
you don't think it's catalepsy?

445
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:08,532
He's never had these
attacks before, has he?

446
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:10,329
I mean, fainting spells,
dizzy spells?

447
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,063
No. No.

448
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,070
But his father--

449
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:14,230
To the best of our knoWledge...

450
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,672
catalepsy is not
an inherited affliction.

451
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:19,131
And there's a neW
line of thought...

452
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,940
among some of us--

453
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,072
myself, Cargrave,
and a feW others--

454
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:25,548
that may shed some
light on Guy's case.

455
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:28,149
You see...

456
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:29,483
most people tend
to think of the body...

457
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,488
and the mind as being
totally different--

458
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:34,013
tWo separate entities--

459
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,185
Whereas, in point of fact...

460
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,195
they're actually linked.

461
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,890
No sugar.

462
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,125
Do you folloW me?

463
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,962
Yes, I think so.

464
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:47,665
You see, physically...

465
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:50,538
Guy may be perfectly sound noW.

466
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,475
HoWever, this constant fear...

467
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,478
that gnaWs at him
night and day...

468
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:57,174
may actually bring about
a condition of catalepsy...

469
00:31:57,215 --> 00:32:00,378
Where no such
condition exists noW.

470
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,147
I see.

471
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:03,744
Well, What can be done?

472
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:06,922
I am not sure.

473
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,582
I'm not sure at all.

474
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:11,026
HoWever, I do knoW this--

475
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,223
that Guy's mind is like
a keg of gunpoWder...

476
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,459
and the smallest thing
might set the fuse--

477
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,990
the most innocent
reminder of death--

478
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:19,697
corpses, graves,
anything at all.

479
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,261
That's the first thing
you must remember.

480
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:22,898
Do you understand?

481
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:23,999
Yes.

482
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,668
Yes, I understand.

483
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:30,670
Oh, Miles, I Wish you could
come and stay With us.

484
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:32,410
Well, I Was just thinking.

485
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,077
The laboratory doWnstairs.

486
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,881
What about it?

487
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,047
Well, you may knoW that Guy
offered me the use of it...

488
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,818
in order to further
my researches.

489
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:42,121
If I accepted his offer...

490
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,594
I might be able to come
here from time to time.

491
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,962
Oh, Miles, that Would be
absolutely Wonderful!

492
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:48,966
Thank you.

493
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,230
Thank you very much.

494
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,430
Well, I must go noW,
but I'll be back.

495
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:59,166
And remember,
the smallest thing.

496
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,472
Don't forget.

497
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:02,069
I Won't forget.

498
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,312
Dear Emily.

499
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:18,889
Frog, please, Judson.

500
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,295
Yes, sir.

501
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,937
Your frog, sir.

502
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:32,602
Oh, put him doWn here, please.

503
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:36,311
NoW, if We place one terminal
of the galvanic battery...

504
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,542
in contact with the nerve...

505
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:42,019
and the other
in contact With muscle...

506
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:44,112
We cause a contraction
of the muscle.

507
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,226
There.

508
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,420
You see?

509
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:52,554
NoW, if you could
control the responses...

510
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,588
of the human mind
as easily as you control...

511
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:55,599
the muscles of a frog...

512
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,396
I might have some faith
in your Work.

513
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:58,697
Someday, We may be able to...

514
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:00,795
if we continue our research.

515
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:02,305
And if you Were
to continue YOUR Work--

516
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,830
No, no, no, no.

517
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,103
You knoW, I think
you should make an effort...

518
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,407
to take your mind
off your fears.

519
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:08,503
You should get aWay
from this place.

520
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,014
Take Emily to Venice.
Then When you return...

521
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,846
most of your problem
Would have disappeared.

522
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,442
Perhaps you're right.
I'll think about it.

523
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:15,850
Don't think about it. Do it.

524
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,479
I may. MeanWhile...

525
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,353
I'll leave you
to your little friends.

526
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,687
Do you Wish to continue, sir?

527
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,718
Hmm?

528
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:27,162
Oh, yes, Judson.

529
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,931
You and Miles Were right.

530
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:36,735
I do have to get
outside occasionally.

531
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:38,639
I told you.

532
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:40,371
All We need is each other.

533
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,542
We need nothing else
to be happy.

534
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,105
How true.

535
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,980
HoW true that really is.

536
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,817
What is it?

537
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,452
Listen!

538
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:00,426
What's the matter, Guy?

539
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:01,693
That Whistling.

540
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:06,760
I don't hear anything.

541
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,237
Listen, I tell you!

542
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,072
Guy!

543
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,086
Guy, don't run aWay!

544
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,314
Guy!

545
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,111
Guy!

546
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:29,909
Darling! Darling, What's Wrong?

547
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:31,012
I saw them.

548
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,181
You saW Whom?

549
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,713
Those tWo filthy grave robbers.

550
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:35,224
They Were coming for me.
Ask Emily.

551
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,454
She saW them, too.

552
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,224
No. I saw no one.

553
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,663
But you must have.
They passed right by us.

554
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,758
Surely you heard them.

555
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,769
Guy, you're overwrought.

556
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,294
I--please.

557
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,705
They Were coming for ME.

558
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:52,265
No one questions your word, Guy.

559
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,106
Don't humor me! I'm not mad!

560
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:56,169
I saW them as clearly
as I'm seeing you!

561
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:57,339
Darling, let's go back
to the house...

562
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:58,848
and you can rest, and--Well...

563
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,510
then you can talk.

564
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:01,609
Come on.

565
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:09,656
You DIDN'T see them?

566
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:10,660
No.

567
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,685
It Was dark and foggy.

568
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:25,405
I'll join you downstairs
in a little while.

569
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:27,706
I just want to rest some more.

570
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,679
All right, darling.

571
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,476
We'll all be Waiting for you.

572
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:54,327
HoW is he, Emily?

573
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:56,339
Well, he's better, I think.

574
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,205
-He's resting.
-Good.

575
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,473
What do you think he saW, Miles?

576
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,605
Exactly What he said--
the tWo grave robbers.

577
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:06,411
Well, then Why
didn't I see them?

578
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,883
Because they Weren't real.

579
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:10,410
You mean, they Were
Something supernatural?

580
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:13,116
I don't deny the possibility
of the supernatural.

581
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:14,181
HoWever, I do believe...

582
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,522
that there's a more
logical explanation.

583
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,893
You see, Emily,
the human mind--

584
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,957
Well, it's a remarkable
instrument.

585
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:25,992
It can create something
out of nothing...

586
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:27,970
and that's probably
What happened.

587
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:30,473
Well...

588
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:32,975
What you're trying
to say is that...

589
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,341
Guy is mad.

590
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,744
No. Nothing of the sort.

591
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:40,809
He's disturbed,
and there's a difference.

592
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:43,684
If his father
Was prematurely interred--

593
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,120
He wasn't.

594
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:47,485
HoW do you knoW?

595
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:49,924
I knoW because
I Went to the crypt...

596
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,428
and saW for myself.

597
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,330
My father rests in peace.

598
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,313
It's the wind.

599
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,695
-Guy!
-He's there!

600
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:12,566
There's nobody there.

601
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,002
But you MUST have seen him!

602
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:16,028
I saW only you, Guy.

603
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:30,911
Miles, What are We going to do?

604
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,616
Ever since that night
on the moors, he's been--

605
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:36,558
Well, I just don't
recognize him anymore.

606
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:38,424
Have you asked him
to go aWay With you?

607
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,656
How can I?

608
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:41,664
He Won't come out
of that terrible place...

609
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:43,999
and Won't let me in.

610
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:49,636
All he Wants to do
is just sit and brood.

611
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:53,806
Miles, you've got
to do something.

612
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:56,278
Emily, I'm afraid
I've done all I can.

613
00:46:58,215 --> 00:47:00,274
Someday, treatment
of the mind...

614
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,217
Will be a science...

615
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:05,779
and they'll be able to cope
With such problems.

616
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,950
But at this present stage--

617
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,755
Emily, there is one thing
We haven't tried.

618
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,830
Well, just tell me What to do.

619
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:20,662
Guy?

620
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,696
Guy, let me in.

621
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:44,421
Well, this is quite a surprise.

622
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:45,951
Is there any purpose
to this visit--

623
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:48,794
apart, that is, from
interrupting my Work?

624
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:49,958
Yes.

625
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,833
I thought
you'd given up painting.

626
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,843
It's merely portraiture.

627
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,175
Let us say I'm entering
a neW period.

628
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,577
May I see it?

629
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:06,549
I don't think you'd
find it very pleasing.

630
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:09,916
Surely I should be
the one to decide that.

631
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:12,114
Very Well. Don't say
I didn't Warn you.

632
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:23,496
I call it "Some Consummations
Devoutly to be Wished."

633
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:24,659
But Why?

634
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:26,066
Think.

635
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:29,038
All these dreadful tortures
you see depicted here--

636
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,972
the rack and the stake...

637
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:32,771
the Whole ghastly catalog--

638
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:35,243
are they not indeed
devoutly to be Wished...

639
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:39,306
preferred to that fate Which
is the most terrible of all?

640
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:42,580
That fate has already
come to pass, Guy.

641
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:43,711
What are you talking about?

642
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,483
About you.

643
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:47,217
You don't fear burial alive...

644
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,725
because you are
already buried alive.

645
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,558
What is it you're afraid of?
Being locked in a tomb?

646
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:55,087
Why, you've been locked
in a tomb for months.

647
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:59,262
THIS tomb!

648
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:00,395
And I've been your WidoW...

649
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,200
and I don't like
being your WidoW, Guy.

650
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:05,106
And What's more, I'm not
going to be much longer.

651
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:07,510
Emily!

652
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:10,604
No, Guy. I'm here
to give you a choice.

653
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:14,515
You can have this--
this living death--

654
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:16,143
or you can have me...

655
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,313
but you can't have both.

656
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:19,322
Emily, please.

657
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:21,824
I love you, Guy.
I love you very much...

658
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:23,985
and I Want
to take care of you...

659
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:27,588
but as long
as you're here, I can't.

660
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,929
No one can.

661
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,958
I realize that, but...

662
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:35,300
I'm so afraid.

663
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:37,967
Oh, you needn't be, my darling.

664
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:40,370
I promise you.

665
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:42,768
Look at me.

666
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:47,575
I promise you that
no matter What happens...

667
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:51,178
I'll never let them
take you doWn to that...

668
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:53,189
that horrible crypt.

669
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:57,118
Trust me to take care of you.

670
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,288
I do trust you, Emily,
but it isn't that.

671
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:05,290
Guy, if you do choose me...

672
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:08,634
then you must destroy
this evil vault.

673
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,572
Wipe it off the face
of the earth...

674
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:12,905
and out of your mind forever!

675
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,343
If you don't...

676
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:19,109
then I shall never
see you again.

677
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:25,950
Well, Which is it to be?

678
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,124
Death by yourself...

679
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:32,022
or life With me?

680
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:04,582
Emily!

681
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:11,933
Please forgive me, darling.

682
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:13,458
I Wouldn't lose you.

683
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:14,936
I just couldn't.

684
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:16,666
Not for anything.

685
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:19,004
Oh, Guy, I love you.

686
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:30,116
Guy, that took great courage.

687
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:33,486
No. Once again,
I Was motivated by fear--

688
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:36,390
fear of losing something
more valuable than my life.

689
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,916
You'll never regret it.

690
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:40,322
I pray God you're right.

691
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:45,061
I Want to thank you both
for asking me to the ceremony.

692
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:48,769
I suppose that noW you'll be
having that honeymoon, huh?

693
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:53,333
Yes, but first there Will be
a small party Friday night.

694
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:55,276
You Will be With us,
Miles, Won't you?

695
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:56,939
If your father doesn't
take it into his mind...

696
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,379
to keep me Working
at the hospital.

697
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:01,213
Oh, he Won't, because
We shall invite both of you.

698
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,446
Well, then, of course,
in that case.

699
00:53:18,962 --> 00:53:20,395
Lady Catherine?

700
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,999
Milord?

701
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,115
Thank you, Judson.

702
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:51,460
My friends, to life.

703
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:59,632
Dr. Gault,
Would you like a cigar?

704
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:00,829
Oh. Thank you. Yes.

705
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,929
-Join us, Miles?
-In just a moment.

706
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:07,098
It's extraordinary,
Lady Catherine...

707
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:08,440
but he looks
the picture of health...

708
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:09,945
don't you agree?

709
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,574
Looks can be deceiving,
Dr. Archer.

710
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:18,247
Thank you.

711
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,892
Well, permit me to offer
my congratulations...

712
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,917
on your lordship's recovery.

713
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:27,020
I think you should offer them
to Emily and to Miles.

714
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:28,360
They are responsible.

715
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:33,060
Well, Father, are you
enjoying yourself?

716
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,627
I never enjoy myself.

717
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:36,662
I merely experience
greater and lesser...

718
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:38,333
degrees of tedium, that's all.

719
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:44,744
It's just the cat, darling.

720
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,180
Yes, I knoW...

721
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:48,241
but Why should
She cry like that?

722
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,877
Hungry, I expect.

723
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:52,887
Where is she?

724
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:54,446
I don't know.

725
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,254
Sounds as if it's coming
from over there.

726
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,453
Poor little thing must be stuck.

727
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:58,688
Wait a moment.

728
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:14,502
Down here.

729
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:24,216
Look at that.

730
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:25,312
It's down here.

731
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:30,651
Down here.

732
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:33,219
There it is.

733
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:35,254
All right, old girl.
We'll have you out in a moment.

734
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:42,704
HoWever could she have
got behind there?

735
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:43,763
It must have craWled through.

736
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:45,900
Let me have the poor wee thing.

737
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:47,409
There, noW.

738
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:49,503
What a thing to happen.

739
00:55:57,553 --> 00:55:59,919
There, you see?
No harm done after all.

740
00:55:59,955 --> 00:56:01,547
There. She's all right.

741
00:56:02,224 --> 00:56:03,885
Guy, are you all right?

742
00:56:05,994 --> 00:56:07,859
What if We hadn't heard her?

743
00:56:07,896 --> 00:56:09,557
But we DID hear her.

744
00:56:10,866 --> 00:56:12,163
You haven't
put these thoughts...

745
00:56:12,201 --> 00:56:14,328
out of your mind
after all, have you?

746
00:56:14,369 --> 00:56:16,599
Oh, of course he has.
This is just a sort of--

747
00:56:16,638 --> 00:56:18,071
You haven't, have you?

748
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:21,703
Guy, you've got to
put it out of your mind.

749
00:56:21,743 --> 00:56:25,042
I've tried.
I've tried everything.

750
00:56:25,881 --> 00:56:27,405
Not everything.

751
00:56:30,652 --> 00:56:33,519
Guy, your fear of catalepsy
is based on your belief...

752
00:56:33,555 --> 00:56:35,455
that your father Was
prematurely buried.

753
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:36,889
Isn't that correct?

754
00:56:36,925 --> 00:56:39,519
I heard him. I heard his voice.

755
00:56:39,561 --> 00:56:40,994
You THINKyou heard it.

756
00:56:41,029 --> 00:56:42,792
I heard his voice!

757
00:56:42,831 --> 00:56:44,355
All right, then prove it.

758
00:56:45,867 --> 00:56:47,198
What do you mean?

759
00:56:47,236 --> 00:56:48,362
Just that--prove it.

760
00:56:48,403 --> 00:56:50,394
Take me doWn to the crypt
and shoW me his body.

761
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,807
I can't.

762
00:56:52,841 --> 00:56:54,206
Because you knoW it isn't true.

763
00:56:54,243 --> 00:56:55,608
-No!
-Yes.

764
00:56:55,644 --> 00:56:57,544
Why else do you think
you've avoided it?

765
00:56:57,579 --> 00:56:59,171
Because you're afraid--
afraid that this fear...

766
00:56:59,214 --> 00:57:01,375
is nothing more
than a trick of your mind.

767
00:57:01,416 --> 00:57:03,884
I'd give anything
to find out if that Were true.

768
00:57:03,919 --> 00:57:05,887
All right, then
take me doWnstairs.

769
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:13,527
All right.

770
00:57:14,663 --> 00:57:15,652
I will.

771
00:57:15,697 --> 00:57:17,688
No. Guy, don't you
think you should rest?

772
00:57:17,733 --> 00:57:19,496
Emily, Miles is right.

773
00:57:19,534 --> 00:57:21,525
I've put this off long enough.

774
00:58:03,145 --> 00:58:05,670
The key to the crypt--
it's gone.

775
00:58:05,714 --> 00:58:07,807
Who has access to these?

776
00:58:07,849 --> 00:58:09,180
No one but myself.

777
00:58:09,217 --> 00:58:10,844
But do you keep it locked?

778
00:58:10,886 --> 00:58:12,046
No, but...

779
00:58:12,688 --> 00:58:15,384
Guy, did you come
doWn here and take the key?

780
00:58:15,424 --> 00:58:16,891
I don't think so.

781
00:58:17,893 --> 00:58:18,917
Is it possible
for someone to do...

782
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,053
a thing like that
and not remember it?

783
00:58:21,096 --> 00:58:22,358
It's possible.
You admit to doing...

784
00:58:22,397 --> 00:58:25,628
many things lately
that you don't remember.

785
00:58:25,667 --> 00:58:28,431
Well, it's unimportant.
We'll break it open.

786
00:58:41,483 --> 00:58:42,677
Follow me.

787
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,652
Which one is it?

788
00:58:54,396 --> 00:58:56,057
Over there.

789
00:59:06,908 --> 00:59:08,375
I can't.

790
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:10,674
You must.
It's your only chance.

791
00:59:10,712 --> 00:59:13,374
If you fail noW,
you'll be haunted forever.

792
00:59:56,057 --> 00:59:57,786
Kate, bring me a mirror.

793
01:00:06,268 --> 01:00:09,066
You're Wasting your time.
He's dead.

794
01:00:09,104 --> 01:00:12,005
No. No, he can't be.

795
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,530
He can't be.

796
01:00:32,694 --> 01:00:35,720
He's finished. Heart attack.

797
01:00:35,764 --> 01:00:36,992
Oh, no!

798
01:00:37,032 --> 01:00:38,522
Are you sure, Dr. Gault?

799
01:00:38,567 --> 01:00:39,693
Of course I am.

800
01:00:39,734 --> 01:00:42,032
No, there's no sign of life,
but to be absolutely sure...

801
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:43,298
We should make one more test.

802
01:00:43,338 --> 01:00:45,670
Foolishness, Archer.
The man's dead.

803
01:00:45,707 --> 01:00:48,005
Judson, help me With
the galvanic battery.

804
01:00:48,043 --> 01:00:50,011
No, don't do this.

805
01:00:50,045 --> 01:00:53,037
Listen to me. I'm alive.
Can't you hear me?

806
01:00:53,081 --> 01:00:55,572
I'm alive! I'm alive!

807
01:01:00,956 --> 01:01:04,392
Uh, Kate, you and Emily
had better leave the room.

808
01:01:08,063 --> 01:01:09,758
Miles.

809
01:01:09,798 --> 01:01:12,790
Miles! In the name of heaven!

810
01:01:44,666 --> 01:01:47,692
Well? Is he dead or isn't he?

811
01:01:49,137 --> 01:01:50,604
He is.

812
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:52,971
No. I'm not dead.

813
01:01:53,008 --> 01:01:54,999
I'm alive!

814
01:01:59,247 --> 01:02:01,340
Judson, help me
With the battery.

815
01:02:02,918 --> 01:02:05,887
We may as Well take him
back to the crypt.

816
01:02:05,921 --> 01:02:10,654
No. I promised him that
no matter What happens...

817
01:02:10,692 --> 01:02:13,593
I'd never let them take him
doWn to the crypt.

818
01:02:13,628 --> 01:02:15,357
Nonsense, Emily.

819
01:02:16,798 --> 01:02:20,427
Oh, Well. It's your decision.

820
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:28,006
Man that is born of woman...

821
01:02:28,043 --> 01:02:31,945
hath but a short time to live,
and is full of misery.

822
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:35,245
He cometh up and is
cut doWn like a floWer.

823
01:02:35,283 --> 01:02:37,547
He fleeth as it were a shadow...

824
01:02:37,586 --> 01:02:40,350
and never continueth
in one stay.

825
01:02:40,388 --> 01:02:43,949
In the midst of life,
We are in death.

826
01:02:43,992 --> 01:02:48,019
Of Whom may We seek for succor
but of thee, dear Lord...

827
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:50,964
Who, for our sins,
art justly displeased?

828
01:02:50,999 --> 01:02:53,490
Yet, O Lord God most mighty...

829
01:02:53,535 --> 01:02:56,129
O holy and most
merciful savior...

830
01:02:56,171 --> 01:02:59,800
deliver us not into the bitter
pain of eternal death.

831
01:02:59,841 --> 01:03:03,333
Thou knoWest, Lord,
the secrets of our hearts.

832
01:03:03,378 --> 01:03:06,211
Shut not thy merciful ears
to thy prayers...

833
01:03:06,247 --> 01:03:08,875
but spare us, God most mighty.

834
01:03:08,917 --> 01:03:13,183
O most merciful savior, thou
most Worthy judge eternal...

835
01:03:13,221 --> 01:03:15,519
suffer us not
at our last hour...

836
01:03:15,557 --> 01:03:19,186
for any pains of death
to fall from thee.

837
01:03:19,227 --> 01:03:21,058
Suffer us not.

838
01:03:23,531 --> 01:03:25,396
Pains of death.

839
01:03:25,433 --> 01:03:28,129
Oh, please, help me!

840
01:03:28,169 --> 01:03:29,761
Someone, help me.

841
01:03:29,804 --> 01:03:30,896
Help me!

842
01:03:30,939 --> 01:03:32,907
Amen.

843
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:37,269
You may say fareWell noW.

844
01:03:47,055 --> 01:03:49,250
Good-bye, my darling.

845
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:50,917
Emily.

846
01:03:50,959 --> 01:03:53,359
Emily, come back.

847
01:03:53,395 --> 01:03:55,192
Come back!

848
01:04:20,588 --> 01:04:22,419
They'll see me.

849
01:04:22,457 --> 01:04:24,118
They'll look at my eyes.

850
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:26,753
They're not taking me
to the crypt.

851
01:04:26,795 --> 01:04:29,730
But...Where ARE
they taking me?

852
01:04:29,764 --> 01:04:32,255
Where? Where?

853
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:33,961
Why can't I move?

854
01:04:34,002 --> 01:04:37,403
Oh, God, Why can't I move?

855
01:05:00,395 --> 01:05:02,363
O merciful God...

856
01:05:02,397 --> 01:05:04,797
We consign the soul
of Guy Carrell...

857
01:05:04,833 --> 01:05:07,495
son of Gideon
and Agatha Carrell...

858
01:05:07,535 --> 01:05:09,332
to thine eternal care.

859
01:05:09,370 --> 01:05:10,394
Amen.

860
01:05:30,091 --> 01:05:31,285
Look at me!

861
01:05:31,326 --> 01:05:32,520
Someone, look at me!

862
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:36,826
Oh, for God's sake, please!
You can't bury me alive!

863
01:05:36,865 --> 01:05:38,856
Can't you see I'm alive?

864
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:42,700
God, Why can't I move?
Why can't I move?

865
01:05:45,874 --> 01:05:48,365
No. No!

866
01:05:48,409 --> 01:05:49,706
Help me.

867
01:05:49,744 --> 01:05:52,076
Someone, help me!

868
01:05:52,113 --> 01:05:54,809
I'm alive!
Can't you hear me?

869
01:05:54,849 --> 01:05:56,817
Can't you see my eyes?

870
01:06:08,129 --> 01:06:10,996
I'm alive! Alive! Ali--

871
01:06:14,869 --> 01:06:17,099
You'll be leaving, I suppose...

872
01:06:17,138 --> 01:06:19,504
after the reading of the Will.

873
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:21,202
Why should you say that?

874
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:26,040
No reason. I merely thought
that under the circumstances...

875
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,776
you might find this
house rather disturbing.

876
01:06:28,817 --> 01:06:30,910
To your conscience, I mean.

877
01:06:30,952 --> 01:06:32,078
Kate, are you implying...

878
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:34,315
that Emily is in any Way
responsible for Guy's death?

879
01:06:34,355 --> 01:06:35,447
No one is responsible.

880
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:37,458
He died of a heart attack
induced by shock.

881
01:06:37,492 --> 01:06:38,516
Don't you understand?

882
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:42,018
Yes. I understand.

883
01:06:42,063 --> 01:06:44,258
The fact is, he brought on
the shock himself.

884
01:06:44,299 --> 01:06:46,267
The episode in the crypt
and all the others--

885
01:06:46,301 --> 01:06:47,393
they Were planned, contrived.

886
01:06:47,435 --> 01:06:48,402
Don't you see?

887
01:06:48,436 --> 01:06:50,233
Planned? By Whom?

888
01:06:50,271 --> 01:06:52,205
By Guy himself.

889
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,698
In a strange Way,
he Wanted to die.

890
01:06:55,743 --> 01:06:57,608
Stop talking about him!

891
01:07:23,571 --> 01:07:26,472
That's a bit much,
Mr. Sweeney.

892
01:07:26,507 --> 01:07:28,031
What is, Mr. Mole?

893
01:07:28,076 --> 01:07:30,738
The old gentleman sending us
out here to dig up this one.

894
01:07:30,778 --> 01:07:32,473
I mean, his oWn son-in-laW!

895
01:07:32,513 --> 01:07:35,482
Well, one stiff's pretty
much like another.

896
01:07:35,516 --> 01:07:38,485
Oh, We've struck Wood.
NoW, Where's the bloody croWbar?

897
01:07:38,519 --> 01:07:40,680
I believe I left it up on top.

898
01:07:40,722 --> 01:07:44,055
Well, Mr. Mole, Would you do me
the kindness to fetch it doWn?

899
01:07:44,092 --> 01:07:45,821
Yes, I Will, Mr. Sweeney.

900
01:08:21,062 --> 01:08:24,054
I found it, Mr. Sweeney!

901
01:08:24,098 --> 01:08:25,656
Huh? No!

902
01:08:27,702 --> 01:08:29,897
No! I never did
nothing to you!

903
01:08:29,938 --> 01:08:31,565
Please! Please!

904
01:08:31,606 --> 01:08:34,268
I've never done nothing
to you. Please!

905
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:07,399
Sweeney! You blithering
idiot! What did you--

906
01:09:07,442 --> 01:09:10,309
I told you to take him
to my quarters.

907
01:09:10,345 --> 01:09:13,405
Oh, Well. May as Well
have a look at him noW.

908
01:09:13,448 --> 01:09:14,745
Yes.

909
01:09:18,019 --> 01:09:19,452
Ironic, don't you think?

910
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:22,718
And rather fitting, really.

911
01:09:22,757 --> 01:09:27,285
In life, Guy Carrell contributed
nothing to medical science.

912
01:09:27,996 --> 01:09:31,397
In death, he shall
Serve it admirably.

913
01:09:34,502 --> 01:09:35,901
Sweeney?

914
01:09:39,674 --> 01:09:42,142
No! You're dead! No!

915
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:29,551
Emily, there's nothing
Whatever Wrong With you.

916
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:33,424
Well, not physically, perhaps.

917
01:10:34,328 --> 01:10:37,695
Then Why did you send
Judson for me? Hmm?

918
01:10:37,732 --> 01:10:42,795
Well, I Was afraid to be alone.

919
01:10:42,837 --> 01:10:44,998
Well, I can understand that.

920
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:48,171
Perhaps you shouldn't be here.

921
01:10:48,209 --> 01:10:51,542
Oh, Miles, don't you see that...

922
01:10:55,483 --> 01:10:57,542
Please come and sit down.

923
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:00,050
Please?

924
01:11:08,196 --> 01:11:10,994
NoW, just for a moment,
and then you must go to sleep.

925
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,492
Miles, you must knoW...

926
01:11:16,537 --> 01:11:19,995
or at least
you must sense that...

927
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:22,009
I've been very Worried today...

928
01:11:22,043 --> 01:11:27,071
that I'm in need of something
or someone to give me solace.

929
01:11:29,884 --> 01:11:32,580
You and I Were
very close once, Miles.

930
01:11:33,921 --> 01:11:35,855
You remember that, don't you?

931
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:39,053
I can remember
a medical student...

932
01:11:39,093 --> 01:11:41,653
Who Was poor
as a church mouse...

933
01:11:41,696 --> 01:11:44,426
and a girl Who Wanted
to be a great lady.

934
01:11:46,501 --> 01:11:48,799
I Was very foolish.

935
01:11:51,472 --> 01:11:52,996
Oh, Miles...

936
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:56,840
maybe it's not too late for us.

937
01:11:56,878 --> 01:11:58,846
But, Emily...

938
01:12:02,717 --> 01:12:04,309
I made a mistake.

939
01:12:08,222 --> 01:12:10,315
Is that so very Wrong?

940
01:12:14,295 --> 01:12:15,785
Come in!

941
01:12:16,964 --> 01:12:17,931
Dr. Archer.

942
01:12:17,965 --> 01:12:19,262
What is it, Judson?

943
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:21,234
It's--excuse me, milady.

944
01:12:21,269 --> 01:12:23,169
It's something I'd
like you to see, sir...

945
01:12:23,204 --> 01:12:24,171
if you Would.

946
01:12:24,205 --> 01:12:25,433
-A medical matter?
-Yes.

947
01:12:25,473 --> 01:12:27,498
Then certainly Dr. Gault
could take care of it.

948
01:12:27,542 --> 01:12:29,134
I think Dr. Gault
Would Want you to come...

949
01:12:29,177 --> 01:12:31,202
as quickly as possible, sir.

950
01:12:31,245 --> 01:12:33,736
Perhaps you had
better go, Miles.

951
01:12:34,849 --> 01:12:36,749
NoW, come along, Judson.

952
01:12:43,424 --> 01:12:45,551
Judson, Why are you
behaving so oddly?

953
01:12:45,593 --> 01:12:48,027
I heard a sound from
the laboratory, sir...

954
01:12:48,062 --> 01:12:49,586
just a bit ago, and...

955
01:12:50,364 --> 01:12:52,127
Yes?

956
01:12:52,166 --> 01:12:54,430
See for yourself, sir.

957
01:13:01,776 --> 01:13:03,175
Who's that?

958
01:13:03,945 --> 01:13:05,537
Miles?

959
01:13:10,585 --> 01:13:12,314
No welcome?

960
01:13:13,487 --> 01:13:15,478
No rejoicing?

961
01:13:16,057 --> 01:13:17,854
No kiss?

962
01:13:30,471 --> 01:13:32,905
He's been killed
by electrical force.

963
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:34,430
Dr. Archer!

964
01:13:37,945 --> 01:13:39,572
That's Sweeney.

965
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:53,488
Emily.

966
01:13:57,331 --> 01:13:58,821
Emily?

967
01:15:10,771 --> 01:15:12,432
Guy.

968
01:15:18,212 --> 01:15:19,406
Now...

969
01:15:19,447 --> 01:15:21,472
Guy, you've got to listen to me.

970
01:15:21,515 --> 01:15:25,042
To what? More lies? More deceit?

971
01:15:25,086 --> 01:15:26,383
More treachery?

972
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:28,115
No, no. That's not true.

973
01:15:28,155 --> 01:15:29,782
Oh, but it is.

974
01:15:29,824 --> 01:15:32,190
You Were very clever, Emily.

975
01:15:32,226 --> 01:15:34,353
VERY clever.

976
01:15:34,395 --> 01:15:37,660
In a Way, I'm sorry
to spoil your plans.

977
01:15:37,698 --> 01:15:39,529
Oh, I had no plans.

978
01:15:39,567 --> 01:15:41,125
It was Kate.

979
01:15:41,902 --> 01:15:44,666
You--you Wouldn't kill me,
Would you, Guy?

980
01:15:44,705 --> 01:15:47,902
No, darling, not at all...

981
01:15:47,942 --> 01:15:50,001
just as you didn't kill ME.

982
01:15:50,044 --> 01:15:53,810
You Wouldn't soil
your pretty hands With murder.

983
01:15:53,848 --> 01:15:57,784
No, you just stood aside
and let them bury me alive!

984
01:15:57,818 --> 01:15:59,683
No, Guy! No!

985
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:03,417
And so...I shall not kill YOU.

986
01:16:03,457 --> 01:16:07,757
That sorry task I shall
leave to the earth...

987
01:16:07,795 --> 01:16:09,319
and the darkness...

988
01:16:09,363 --> 01:16:12,890
and the terrified pounding
of your oWn heart.

989
01:16:27,715 --> 01:16:29,376
Guy, no! Not that!

990
01:16:29,417 --> 01:16:32,113
Yes, my beautiful,
my perfidious...

991
01:16:32,153 --> 01:16:34,917
my treacherous love...THAT.

992
01:16:48,068 --> 01:16:50,195
No, Guy!

993
01:17:03,717 --> 01:17:04,843
Guy!

994
01:17:08,456 --> 01:17:11,050
Stay precisely
Where you are, Miles.

995
01:17:11,091 --> 01:17:12,956
I've no desire to harm you.

996
01:17:13,727 --> 01:17:15,354
What have you done, Guy?

997
01:17:15,396 --> 01:17:17,887
Paid a debt of long standing.

998
01:17:17,932 --> 01:17:19,490
No!

999
01:17:19,533 --> 01:17:21,501
This has nothing to do With you.

1000
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:23,662
I found that out
earlier this evening.

1001
01:17:23,704 --> 01:17:25,171
In heaven's name, Guy!

1002
01:17:25,206 --> 01:17:27,697
Yes...in heaven's name.

1003
01:17:27,741 --> 01:17:29,436
Give me that shovel!

1004
01:19:05,139 --> 01:19:06,629
She's dead!

1005
01:19:08,275 --> 01:19:10,004
Thank God.

1006
01:19:10,044 --> 01:19:11,636
Kate, What are you saying?

1007
01:19:13,347 --> 01:19:15,281
Are you so blind?

1008
01:19:17,284 --> 01:19:18,842
Can't you see?

1009
01:19:23,557 --> 01:19:25,616
That's the key to the crypt.

1010
01:19:25,659 --> 01:19:28,560
She had no time to replace it.

1011
01:19:31,065 --> 01:19:33,033
I can't believe it. Not Emily.

1012
01:19:33,067 --> 01:19:35,661
Yes. Emily.

1013
01:19:35,703 --> 01:19:40,697
Sweet, beautiful, gentle Emily.

1014
01:19:40,741 --> 01:19:43,608
Once you told her
hoW easy it Would be...

1015
01:19:43,644 --> 01:19:47,740
to use Guy's fear to kill him,
she Went to Work.

1016
01:19:52,987 --> 01:19:56,479
First, the hiring
of the grave robbers...

1017
01:19:56,523 --> 01:19:58,787
to torment him...

1018
01:19:58,826 --> 01:20:01,317
the cat in the Wall...

1019
01:20:01,362 --> 01:20:05,230
and finally the desecration
of our father's tomb.

1020
01:20:07,568 --> 01:20:10,002
Oh, Guy!

1021
01:20:10,537 --> 01:20:12,664
I kneW What she Was doing...

1022
01:20:12,706 --> 01:20:15,140
and I Wanted to tell you...

1023
01:20:15,175 --> 01:20:17,973
but you Wouldn't
have believed me.

1024
01:20:18,012 --> 01:20:20,503
I had to wait for proof.

1025
01:20:20,547 --> 01:20:23,710
You can see that, can't you?

1026
01:20:25,319 --> 01:20:27,685
But I Waited too long.

1027
01:20:29,056 --> 01:20:31,718
I was too late.

1028
01:20:34,128 --> 01:20:36,323
Too late.

1029
01:21:05,284 --> 01:21:08,284
