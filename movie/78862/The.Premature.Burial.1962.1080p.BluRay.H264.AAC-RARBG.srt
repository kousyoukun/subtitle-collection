1
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:33,855
-下午好，高尔特小姐。-下午好，贾德森，我想看看…
- Good afternoon Miss Gault. - Good afternoon Judson, I'd like to see...

2
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,215
-你好，凯特。-你想要什么?
- Hello Kate. - What do you want?

3
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:40,801
你能告诉盖伊我想见他吗?
Will you tell Guy that I would like to see him?

4
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:47,196
-恐怕他不想见你。-我得听盖伊亲口说。
- I'm afraid he doesn't wish to see you. - I shall have to hear that from Guy himself.

5
00:03:48,346 --> 00:03:51,801
哦，真的吗，凯特，你不觉得至少我应该得到一个解释吗?
Oh really Kate, don't you think at least I deserve an explanation?

6
00:03:54,406 --> 00:03:55,747
很好。
Very well.

7
00:03:58,812 --> 00:04:00,537
请您在这里等一下好吗?
Will you please wait here?

8
00:04:28,392 --> 00:04:32,265
抱歉，那家伙不想见你。
I'm sorry, guy does not wish to see you.

9
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:35,194
我告诉过你，我得听盖伊亲口说。
I told you I have to hear that from Guy himself.

10
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:48,895
——人?——艾米丽。
- Guy? - Emily.

11
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,493
-艾米丽你不该来这里-所以我理解。
- Emily you, you shouldn't have come here. - So I understand.

12
00:04:58,045 --> 00:05:02,428
但是盖伊，你不觉得我应该得到比一封信更多的东西吗?
But Guy, don't you think I deserve something a little more than a letter?

13
00:05:03,841 --> 00:05:10,094
-看着我，告诉我你不爱我。-亲爱的，我真的很爱你。
- Look at me and tell me you don't love me. - My darling, I do love you very much.

14
00:05:10,357 --> 00:05:13,997
所以我才给你写那封信因为我真的爱你。
That's why I sent you that letter because I do love you.

15
00:05:14,692 --> 00:05:19,003
现在，亲爱的，请你走开，忘记你曾经见过我。
Now, darling, please go away and forget you ever met me.

16
00:05:20,057 --> 00:05:24,536
我知道发生了什么，盖伊。我父亲告诉我的。
I know what happened Guy. My father told me.

17
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:30,059
不管他怎么想，他有没有告诉你原因。
Did he tell you why, despite what he thinks.

18
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:35,712
我不是逃离棺材里的东西而是逃离我内心深处的东西。
I didn't run away from what was inside that coffin but from what I knew to be inside me.

19
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,299
我，我不明白。
I, I don't understand.

20
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:41,142
我本想省了你的。
I'd hoped to spare you this.

21
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:45,669
如果你真的明白了，你就会明白为什么我们之间永远不可能结婚。
If you do understand, then you'll realize why there can never be a marriage between us.

22
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:48,574
跟我来。
Come with me.

23
00:06:02,898 --> 00:06:05,796
-这条路通向哪里?——下面。
- Where does this lead? - Below.

24
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,945
-你没事吧?-是的，我想是的。
- Are you all right? - Yes I, I think so.

25
00:06:52,355 --> 00:06:55,972
-你想回去吗?-不，不。
- You want to go back? - No, no.

26
00:07:04,043 --> 00:07:07,061
你经常说想见见我的家人。
You've often expressed a wish to meet the rest of my family.

27
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:17,193
好吧，这些都是我的祖先，有名的和臭名昭著的……放在这里，这个词是什么?休息。
Well, here they are all my ancestors, famous and infamous... laid here to, what is the term? To rest.

28
00:07:20,618 --> 00:07:28,570
从一开始，死亡就像刺客一样来到卡雷尔家…但最不幸的是我父亲。
From the beginning, death has come to the Carrells like an assassin... but the least fortunate of all is my father.

29
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,462
他是怎么死的?
How did he die?

30
00:07:31,037 --> 00:07:34,869
就像黑暗里的一根蜡烛。
Like a single candle in a dark and airless room.

31
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:42,457
-艾米丽，我父亲…-人…-凯特，你怎么来了?-该吃药了。
- Emily, my father... - Guy... - Kate, why you here? - It's time for your medicine.

32
00:07:42,487 --> 00:07:46,104
-哦，是的，我忘了，对不起，谢谢。-什么药?
- Oh yes, I'd forgotten I'm sorry, thank you. - What medicine?

33
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:53,530
鸦片酊。
Laudanum.

34
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:58,816
-伙计，这就是…-不，不是原因，是结果。
- Guy, is this the cause of... - No, not a cause, an effect.

35
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,475
没有它们我就睡不着。
Without them I couldn't sleep.

36
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,427
伙计，告诉我。
Guy, tell me.

37
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:10,352
那晚我不该和你父亲还有其他医生一起去的。
I should never have gone with your father and those other doctors that night.

38
00:08:10,353 --> 00:08:13,013
我只对私人研究感兴趣。
I'm interested only in private research.

39
00:08:13,043 --> 00:08:16,971
我永远不会忘记那个被他们洗劫了坟墓的可怜人。
I can never forget that poor wretch whose grave they robbed.

40
00:08:18,337 --> 00:08:28,534
他瞪大的眼睛，紧握的双手……他的指甲……在徒劳无功地撬开棺材盖的过程中，他浑身是血。
His staring eyes, his clutching hands... his fingernails... broken and bloody from the vain attempt to claw away the lid of that coffin.

41
00:08:29,771 --> 00:08:32,646
你看，这一切对我来说都有特殊的意义艾米丽。
You see, all this has a special meaning for me Emily.

42
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:37,923
多年来，我一直生活在被活埋的恐惧中。
For years I've lived in dread of being buried alive.

43
00:08:40,762 --> 00:08:43,408
你能想象吗?
Can you possibly conceive it?

44
00:08:44,535 --> 00:09:02,858
肺部难以忍受的压迫，潮湿土地上令人窒息的烟雾……棺材僵硬的拥抱，漆黑的夜……而沉默，就像汹涌的大海。
The unendurable oppression of the lungs, the stifling fumes of the damp earth... the rigid embrace of the coffin, the blackness of absolute night... and the silence, like an overwhelming sea.

45
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:13,541
然后……在黑暗中看不见，但对其他感官来说却太可怕了……-征服者蠕虫的出现。——人?
And then... invisible in the darkness but all too hideously real to the other senses... - the presence of the conqueror worm. - Guy?

46
00:09:18,403 --> 00:09:21,769
-对不起。-这些都是病态的幻想。
- I'm sorry. - These are just morbid fantasies.

47
00:09:22,092 --> 00:09:27,122
恐怕不是，我的每一个家庭成员都遭遇了暴力和可怕的死亡。
I'm afraid not, every member of my family has met with a violent and horrible death.

48
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,302
现在轮到我了。
I now wait my turn.

49
00:09:29,332 --> 00:09:35,074
-你父亲是怎么死的?-晕厥，你知道那是什么吗?
- How did your father die? - Catalepsy, you know what that is?

50
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:42,432
当它来袭的时候，死者表现出死亡的迹象。
When it strikes, the victim gives every outward sign of being dead.

51
00:09:43,018 --> 00:09:46,634
但他没死，他还活着。
But he's not dead, he's alive.

52
00:09:47,736 --> 00:10:00,008
我父亲患病时我才13岁。医生说是心脏病发作…有个葬礼，他被封存在这个地窖里。
I was barely 13 when my father was stricken... doctor said it was a heart attack... there was a funeral and he was sealed in this vault.

53
00:10:02,044 --> 00:10:08,822
那天晚上……我听见他在哭喊，一声可怜的、绝望的哭喊。
That night... I heard him crying out, a pitiful, desperate cry.

54
00:10:09,134 --> 00:10:16,088
我恳求他们，我恳求他们。他还活着他还活着我说…——但是没有人会相信我。-因为那不是真的
I begged with them, I pleaded with them. He's alive, he's alive I said... - but no one would believe me. - Because it wasn't true.

55
00:10:17,237 --> 00:10:18,602
这是。
It was.

56
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,497
-我听到了。-在你心里。
- I heard him. - In your mind.

57
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:26,857
不,凯特。
No, Kate.

58
00:10:27,244 --> 00:10:29,589
这对我来说更容易接受。
It would be easier for me to accept that.

59
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:34,464
但我知道真相。上帝保佑，我知道真相。
But I know the truth. God help me, I know the truth.

60
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,820
这是我父亲的遗产也是我送给你的结婚礼物。
My father's inheritance and my wedding gift to you, catalepsy.

61
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,023
现在你知道我为什么请求你的原谅了吧。
Now you know why I asked your forgiveness.

62
00:10:57,053 --> 00:11:02,304
-没什么好原谅的。-但你必须明白…我知道我爱你，我想成为你的妻子。
- There's nothing to forgive. - But you must understand... I understand that I love you and that I want to be your wife.

63
00:11:02,342 --> 00:11:07,377
Gault小姐……-我哥哥病了。-那我就照顾他，让他恢复健康。
Miss Gault... - My brother is ill. - Then I shall nurse him back to health.

64
00:11:07,617 --> 00:11:12,468
艾米丽……盖伊，如果你爱我，如果你真的爱我你就不会把我排除在你的生活之外。
Emily... Guy, if you love me, if you really love me you won't shut me out of your life.

65
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:14,069
你会让我和你分享的。
You'll let me share it with you.

66
00:11:14,904 --> 00:11:20,008
-你想要吗?在你听到这些之后?-比以往任何时候都多。
- You want that? After what you've heard? - More than ever before.

67
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,030
告诉她盖伊，告诉她。
Tell her Guy, tell her.

68
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:37,801
凯特，你考虑得太周到了你总是为我着想。
Kate, you've been most considerate and you've always thought of my welfare.

69
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,378
这是真的。
That is true.

70
00:11:39,684 --> 00:11:42,550
但有些事情，我必须自己做决定。
But in some things, I must make my own decisions.

71
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,846
当然
Of course.

72
00:11:45,707 --> 00:11:48,832
那么我想你已经决定了吧?
Then I take it you have made your decision?

73
00:11:49,714 --> 00:11:50,827
我有。
I have.

74
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,120
那就让责任落在你自己头上吧。
Then let it be on your own head.

75
00:12:06,552 --> 00:12:15,148
你愿意娶艾米丽为你的合法妻子吗无论顺境还是逆境，无论疾病还是健康，只要你们俩还活着?
Do you Guy, take Emily to be your lawful wedded wife... for better, for worse, in sickness and in health, so long as you both shall live?

76
00:12:15,547 --> 00:12:16,832
我做的事。
I do.

77
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:26,097
艾米丽，你愿意娶盖伊为你的合法丈夫吗?无论顺境还是逆境，无论疾病还是健康，只要你们俩还活着?
Do you Emily, take Guy to be your lawful wedded husband... for better, for worse, in sickness and in health, so long as you both shall live?

78
00:12:26,594 --> 00:12:27,811
我做的事。
I do.

79
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:36,323
如果这里有人知道为什么这两个人不应该在一起…在神圣的婚姻中让他现在开口，否则永远保持沉默。
If there be any here who know just cause why these two should not be joined together... in holy matrimony let him speak now or forever hold his peace.

80
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:43,533
请把戒指给我。
The ring please.

81
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:49,761
跟着我说，我和这枚戒指结了婚。
Repeat after me, with this ring I thee wed.

82
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,223
我带着这枚戒指娶你。
With this ring I thee wed.

83
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:58,009
那我正式宣布你们结为夫妻。
Then I do pronounce you man and wife.

84
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:11,052
-香槟夫人凯瑟琳?-谢谢。
- Champagne Lady Catherine? - Thank you.

85
00:13:12,427 --> 00:13:14,439
哦，是的，一个美丽的仪式。
Oh yes, a beautiful ceremony.

86
00:13:15,323 --> 00:13:19,969
敬最美丽的新娘，最幸运的新郎。
A toast, to the most beautiful bride, the most fortunate groom who ever lived.

87
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,149
愿他们幸福终老。
May they be happy to the end of their days.

88
00:13:26,148 --> 00:13:28,284
不行，伙计，不要在大家面前。
No Guy, not in front of everyone.

89
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:33,583
那么，在我完全失去控制之前，你最好去玩点什么。
Well then, you'd better go and play something before I lose control completely.

90
00:13:36,396 --> 00:13:38,519
-她是不是很漂亮?——非常。
- Isn't she beautiful? - Very.

91
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:45,747
你玩得开心吗，父亲?
Are you enjoying yourself, father?

92
00:13:48,754 --> 00:13:50,755
别停止演艾米丽，很可爱。
Don't stop playing Emily, it's lovely.

93
00:13:53,393 --> 00:13:55,369
祝你幸福美满。
I want to wish you every happiness.

94
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,228
谢谢你，迈尔斯。
Thank you Miles.

95
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:02,793
我知道你要去威尼斯度蜜月。
You going to Venice for the honeymoon I understand.

96
00:14:08,326 --> 00:14:09,968
那是什么?我，对不起。
What was that? I, I'm sorry.

97
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:12,928
我问你是否要去威尼斯度蜜月。
I inquired if you were going to Venice for your honeymoon.

98
00:14:13,438 --> 00:14:17,292
我不习惯和人…卡雷尔。
I'm not accustomed to people... Carrell.

99
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:22,864
请原谅我。
Forgive me, please.

100
00:14:24,214 --> 00:14:26,558
这家伙到底怎么了?
What the devil is the matter with the fella?

101
00:14:28,093 --> 00:14:29,664
——艾米丽。-什么事，亲爱的?
- Emily. - Yes darling?

102
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:31,835
你在弹的旋律是什么?
That melody you're playing, what is it?

103
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:36,809
-是莫莉·马龙，你不喜欢吗?-不，别玩了。
- It's Molly Malone, don't you like it? - No, please stop playing.

104
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:40,452
-但这旋律很迷人。-我说了别弹了。
- But it's a charming melody. - I said please stop playing it.

105
00:14:43,962 --> 00:14:44,962
对不起，我…
I'm sorry I...

106
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:54,969
-有什么我能做的吗，盖伊?-不，没什么。
- Is there anything I can do Guy? - No, nothing.

107
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,800
-我跟你一起去，盖伊。-不，请别烦我。
- I'll come with you Guy. - No, please leave me alone.

108
00:14:57,801 --> 00:14:59,934
你们所有人，请离我远点。
All of you, leave me alone please.

109
00:15:39,262 --> 00:15:41,391
盖伊，盖伊，亲爱的。
Guy, Guy darling.

110
00:15:41,784 --> 00:15:46,266
-醒醒吧，他们都走了。-是的，艾米莉。
- Please wake up, they all gone now. - Yes Emily.

111
00:15:50,457 --> 00:15:53,786
-你感觉好点了吗?-我想是的。
- Are you feeling better? - I think so.

112
00:15:56,804 --> 00:15:58,045
怎么了，盖伊?
What's the matter Guy?

113
00:15:58,984 --> 00:16:04,349
-你在下面发生了什么?-我记不清了。
- What happened to you down there? - I can't remember exactly.

114
00:16:04,742 --> 00:16:08,660
-我在和你爸爸说话，然后…-然后呢?
- I was talking with your father and then... - And the then what?

115
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:13,157
音乐，关于你演奏的音乐。
The music, something about the music you were playing.

116
00:16:13,187 --> 00:16:15,535
音乐是怎么回事?
What was it about the music?

117
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:19,414
这就是他那天晚上吹口哨的曲调。
It was the tune he was whistling that night.

118
00:16:19,654 --> 00:16:22,729
-是谁?-有两个人。
- Who was? - There were two of them.

119
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:28,325
斯威尼和鼹鼠是他们的名字。哦，肮脏，恶心的生物。
Sweeney and Mole were their names. Oh, filthy, disgusting creatures.

120
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:35,199
是他们打开了坟墓，一直吹着那首讨厌的曲子。
They were the ones who opened the grave and all the time whistling that loathsome tune.

121
00:16:36,276 --> 00:16:40,181
亲爱的，现在只有我们了。
Darling, now we're alone.

122
00:16:40,774 --> 00:16:44,324
就我们两个人。
Alone, just the two of us.

123
00:16:45,425 --> 00:16:47,030
在一起。
Together.

124
00:16:57,137 --> 00:17:00,275
-那是什么?-我不知道。
- What was that? - I don't know.

125
00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:07,070
-听起来像尖叫。-待在这里。
- Sounded like a scream. - Stay here.

126
00:18:52,676 --> 00:18:57,850
-国王，老国王。-他死了。
- King, King old fellow. - He is dead.

127
00:19:00,795 --> 00:19:02,520
一定是闪电。
It must've been the lightning.

128
00:19:03,598 --> 00:19:06,376
-我们把他埋了。-随你便。
- We'll bury him. - As you wish.

129
00:19:07,238 --> 00:19:09,682
现在让我们从雨里出去吧，盖伊。
Now let us go in out of the rain Guy.

130
00:19:22,005 --> 00:19:24,281
他只是惊呆了。
Why, he was only stunned.

131
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:29,143
-我要把他埋了。——人?
- I was going to bury him. - Guy?

132
00:19:29,718 --> 00:19:34,820
我要把他埋了……活着。
I was going to bury him... alive.

133
00:19:39,323 --> 00:19:41,192
草图吗?在这里吗?
Sketching? Out here?

134
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:44,713
不，不是画草图，是制定计划。
No, not sketching really, making plans.

135
00:19:45,024 --> 00:19:48,683
-为了房子?-你很好奇。
- For the house? - You're very inquisitive.

136
00:19:48,713 --> 00:19:52,299
我现在结婚了，妻子应该很好奇。
Well, I'm married now and wives are supposed to be inquisitive.

137
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:54,429
丈夫应该是保密的。
And husbands are supposed to be secretive.

138
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:58,405
不过，我要告诉你我的一个秘密，一个严守的秘密。
However, I'll tell you one of my secrets, a very closely guarded one.

139
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,856
我有能力在不碰触女人的情况下亲吻她。
I possess the ability to kiss a woman without touching her.

140
00:20:01,886 --> 00:20:03,844
哦，盖伊，真的吗?
Oh, Guy really.

141
00:20:03,874 --> 00:20:07,093
你不相信我?我跟你赌一先令。
You don't believe me? I'll wager you a shilling.

142
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:10,064
好吧，我接受你的打赌。
All right, I'll accept your wager.

143
00:20:10,854 --> 00:20:14,925
-来吧，给我看看这个奇迹。-乐意之至。
- Come on, show me this miracle. - With pleasure.

144
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:21,081
给你。
There you are.

145
00:20:21,752 --> 00:20:25,009
-那你的赌注呢?-哦，我输了。
- What about your wager? - Oh, I lose the wager.

146
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,284
这是你的先令。
Here's your shilling.

147
00:20:28,646 --> 00:20:31,068
相信我，它值更多的钱。
It was worth much more believe me.

148
00:20:33,152 --> 00:20:35,787
——人?-什么事，亲爱的?
- Guy? - Yes dear?

149
00:20:37,631 --> 00:20:39,500
我们的蜜月怎么样?
What about our honeymoon?

150
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,949
你答应过带我去威尼斯的，记得吗?
You promised you'd take me to Venice, remember?

151
00:20:42,979 --> 00:20:51,524
-你在这里不开心吗?-哦，是的，当然，但是……你太靠自己了，我很担心你。
- Aren't you happy here? - Oh yes, of course but... well, you're on your own so much and I worry about you.

152
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,099
你必须对我有耐心。
You must be patient with me.

153
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:59,680
好吧，与此同时，我会点亮那座沉闷的老房子。
All right, in the meantime I'll brighten up that dreary old house.

154
00:21:00,877 --> 00:21:02,170
在那里。
There.

155
00:21:04,158 --> 00:21:07,152
-看，他们是不是很可爱?-把它们拿走。
- Look, aren't they lovely? - Take them away.

156
00:21:07,488 --> 00:21:10,185
伙计，别这么坏脾气。
Guy, don't be so ill-tempered.

157
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:14,755
我无法忍受住在一个没有花的房子里。——你也不应该。-把它们扔掉。
I can't bear living in a house without flowers... - and neither should you. - Just throw them away.

158
00:21:14,756 --> 00:21:15,756
我讨厌花。
I loathe flowers.

159
00:21:16,137 --> 00:21:20,087
你必须保证永远不把那些难看的葬礼装饰品带到家里来。
You must promise never to bring those sickly funeral decorations into the house.

160
00:21:20,088 --> 00:21:22,038
-盖伊，我只是…-你必须答应我。
- Guy, I was only... - You must promise.

161
00:21:23,171 --> 00:21:27,439
好吧，我保证。
All right, I promise.

162
00:21:34,816 --> 00:21:36,893
——夫人?-是的，贾德森。
- Milady? - Yes Judson.

163
00:21:36,923 --> 00:21:39,989
-亚彻医生到了，夫人。-哦，请带他进来。
- Dr. Archer has arrived milady. - Oh, show him in please.

164
00:21:53,953 --> 00:21:56,301
-这边走，先生-谢谢你贾德森
- This way sir. - Thank you Judson.

165
00:21:57,163 --> 00:21:58,265
艾米丽。
Emily.

166
00:21:59,127 --> 00:22:03,127
-亲爱的迈尔斯，你能来真是太好了。我一收到你的信息就来了。
- Miles dear, how kind of you to come. - I came directly I received your message.

167
00:22:03,128 --> 00:22:05,253
-出什么事了吗?——是的。
- Is something wrong? - Yes.

168
00:22:06,457 --> 00:22:09,565
-盖伊病了。-哦，听到这个我很难过。
- Guy is ill. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

169
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:12,645
我想是因为意大利的气候吧。-我们没去意大利。
- I suppose it's the Italian climate. - We didn't go to Italy.

170
00:22:12,963 --> 00:22:16,770
但我以为……我们从结婚那天起就一直住在这房子里。
But I thought... We've been here in this house ever since the day we were married.

171
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:20,206
-我不明白。-我也不想。
- I don't understand. - Neither do I.

172
00:22:21,336 --> 00:22:25,693
我只知道盖伊病了，你得帮他，迈尔斯。
All I know is that Guy is ill and you've got to help him Miles.

173
00:22:26,246 --> 00:22:29,043
但是亲爱的，你父亲已经尽力了。
But my dear, surely your father has done everything that can be done.

174
00:22:29,044 --> 00:22:30,713
我父亲什么也没做。
My father has done nothing.

175
00:22:30,885 --> 00:22:37,827
对他来说，盖伊是一个非常健康的人，但事实并非如此……你必须做点什么来帮助他，迈尔斯。
To him, Guy is a perfectly healthy man but that isn't true... and you must do something to help him Miles.

176
00:22:38,348 --> 00:22:40,598
如果你不这样做，可怕的事情就会发生。
If you don't, something terrible will happen.

177
00:22:40,973 --> 00:22:44,766
他完全变了一个人。我，我都不认识他了。
He's a completely changed man. I, I don't even recognize him.

178
00:22:46,423 --> 00:22:48,350
好吧，我会尽力的。
Well, I'll do whatever I can.

179
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:53,351
-你带我去见他吧?-谢谢你，迈尔斯。
- Why don't you take me to him? - Thank you Miles.

180
00:22:53,381 --> 00:22:55,541
-我刚拿到我的围巾。-你的围巾?
- I just get my wrap. - Your wrap?

181
00:22:55,848 --> 00:22:57,407
但是荒野上很冷。
But it's chilly on the moors.

182
00:23:03,752 --> 00:23:08,847
艾米丽……-他在哪儿?——有。
Emily... - Where is he? - There.

183
00:23:11,191 --> 00:23:12,791
一个月前开始建的。
Started building it a month ago.

184
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:28,029
家伙?
Guy?

185
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:31,324
——人?——是吗?
- Guy? - Yes?

186
00:23:31,962 --> 00:23:34,982
-让我进去。-走开，我很忙。
- Let me in. - Go away, I'm busy.

187
00:23:35,853 --> 00:23:37,719
伙计，请开门。
Guy, please open the door.

188
00:23:38,087 --> 00:23:44,482
艾米丽，你不明白吗，我说我…-你好，盖伊。-你好迈尔斯，很高兴见到你。
Emily, didn't you understand me, I said I was... - Hello Guy. - Hello Miles, I'm glad to see you.

189
00:23:45,242 --> 00:23:50,374
-我必须道歉，我太粗鲁了。-是的，盖伊，你很粗鲁。
- I must apologize, I was very rude. - Yes Guy, you were, very rude.

190
00:23:50,618 --> 00:23:53,480
-你知道，我病得很重。-所以我理解。
- You see, I've been quite ill. - So I understand.

191
00:23:54,755 --> 00:23:57,738
盖伊，我把迈尔斯带来了看看他能不能帮你。
Guy, I have brought Miles along to see if he can help you.

192
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:03,187
你很关心我，但完全没有必要，我现在自己吃。
That's very solicitous but quite unnecessary, I'm helping myself now.

193
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,299
-怎么了盖伊?——如何?
- How Guy? - How?

194
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,184
进来吧，我带你去。
Come inside, I'll show you.

195
00:24:25,414 --> 00:24:29,354
就是这样，我的宏伟计划。
This is it, my grand plan.

196
00:24:30,876 --> 00:24:34,165
是什么事?来点利口酒，白兰地，还是阿蒙提拉多?
What it be? Some liqueur, brandy, amontillado?

197
00:24:36,436 --> 00:24:37,995
伙计，我带了…
Guy, I brought...

198
00:24:48,156 --> 00:24:52,476
现在，让我们为适当的事情干杯……死。
Now, let us drink to something appropriate... to death.

199
00:24:55,373 --> 00:24:58,696
不喝酒吗?真遗憾，它真的很不错。
Not drinking? What a pity, it's really quite good.

200
00:24:59,189 --> 00:25:01,534
——人?-什么事，亲爱的?
- Guy? - Yes my dear?

201
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:04,994
-你想说点什么吗?——没有。
- You wish to say something? - No.

202
00:25:05,915 --> 00:25:08,865
好吧，既然这样，让我告诉你我的新成员。
Well, in that case let me tell you about my latest addition.

203
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:10,829
我前天晚上就想到了。
I thought of it the night before last.

204
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:14,935
当然，我不太可能会用它，但谁知道呢，不是吗?
Of course, it's highly unlikely I shall ever use it but one never knows, does one?

205
00:25:19,573 --> 00:25:23,845
允许很容易的出口，从外面完全无法通行。
Permits of easy egress and it's completely impassable from the outside.

206
00:25:24,287 --> 00:25:27,478
我同意这种安排很简单，但很有效。
A simple arrangement I grant, but effective.

207
00:25:29,135 --> 00:25:30,412
伙计，这太疯狂了。
Guy, this is madness.

208
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:34,597
疯狂吗?这是唯一能解决我问题的答案。
Madness? It's the only sane answer to my problem.

209
00:25:35,431 --> 00:25:37,554
我会让你知道我有多生气。
I'll show you just how mad I am.

210
00:25:40,402 --> 00:25:43,249
我想她告诉过你，我父亲是一名过敏者。
I suppose she's told you my father was a cataleptic.

211
00:25:43,495 --> 00:25:47,079
-不，但这并不意味着…-我也有同样的苦恼。
- No, but that doesn't mean that... - I am prone to the same affliction.

212
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:50,860
很好，让我们考虑以下问题。
Very well, let us consider the following.

213
00:25:51,707 --> 00:25:56,137
说什么也没说，我发作了。假设它发生在晚餐期间。
Apropos of nothing at all, I have an attack. Let us say it happens during dinner.

214
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:58,918
艾米丽让贾德森去请医生。
Emily sends Judson to fetch a doctor.

215
00:25:58,948 --> 00:26:03,269
医生来了，他检查了我，宣布我死亡。当然，我还活着。
The doctor arrives, he examines me and pronounces me dead. I am, of course, alive.

216
00:26:03,358 --> 00:26:05,067
你知道晕厥的本质。
You know the nature of catalepsy.

217
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:11,609
但对世界上其他人来说，我已经走了，已经去世了。
But to the rest of the world I am gone, passed on, deceased.

218
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:18,612
所以举行了葬礼，我被带到这个墓穴，放在这个棺材里。
So a funeral is held and I'm brought down here to this vault and placed in this coffin.

219
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:31,708
送葬的人都走了，门都锁上了，只剩我一个人。
The mourners have departed, the doors are both locked and I'm alone.

220
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:34,869
现在，请密切注意。
Now, pay close attention.

221
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:58,088
现在，我的手指稍微动一下就会发生这种情况。
Now, the slightest movement of my finger caused that to happen.

222
00:26:58,613 --> 00:27:03,660
我现在从棺材里出来了，但我仍然只能稍微努力一下。
I am now free of the casket but I'm still capable of only slight effort.

223
00:27:04,505 --> 00:27:05,671
所以…
So...

224
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:14,984
但你说，假如没有人听到钟声，离开的哀悼者就会把两扇门都锁上。
But you say, supposing no one hears the bell, the departing mourners lock both the doors.

225
00:27:27,349 --> 00:27:31,292
但这真的是万无一失吗?如果门卡住了怎么办?
But is that really foolproof? What if the gate should stick?

226
00:27:42,675 --> 00:27:43,675
你看到了什么?
You see?

227
00:27:45,191 --> 00:27:48,776
但是，当然，几乎不可能所有这些方法都失败。
But, of course, it's barely possible that all these methods might fail.

228
00:27:49,103 --> 00:27:50,300
所以…
So...

229
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:56,329
但是工具也会坏，不是吗?
But tools break too, don't they?

230
00:28:03,693 --> 00:28:07,912
一位名叫诺贝尔的瑞典化学家最近发明了一种炸药。
A recent invention by a Swedish chemist named Nobel, it's called dynamite.

231
00:28:08,158 --> 00:28:09,385
这是一种炸药。
It's an explosive.

232
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,321
但人们怎么能确定这些东西会起作用呢?
But how can one be sure the stuff will work?

233
00:28:13,236 --> 00:28:14,617
当然，这是不可能的。
One can't, of course.

234
00:28:17,348 --> 00:28:18,560
所以…
So...

235
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:29,268
一个人有一点吃的，喝的……每隔五分钟或十分钟左右就会响一次铃。
one has a bit of food, something to drink... every five or ten minutes or so rings the bell.

236
00:28:29,851 --> 00:28:32,030
读一份期刊或一本书。
Reads a periodical or perhaps a book.

237
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:37,445
万一紧张变成……太伟大的人可以利用音乐的舒缓效果。
In the event the strain becomes... too great one can avail oneself with the soothing effects of music.

238
00:28:38,497 --> 00:28:39,960
然后就等着。
And then one simply waits.

239
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,130
考虑得很周全，你不觉得吗?
Rather well thought out, don't you think?

240
00:28:44,211 --> 00:28:45,979
但是没有一个计划是完美的。
But no plan is ever perfect.

241
00:28:46,823 --> 00:28:52,005
所以现在出现了阻力，或者应该说是致命一击。
So now comes the piece de resistance or perhaps one should say the coup de grace.

242
00:29:06,115 --> 00:29:08,324
-怎么了，盖伊?-怎么了?
- What is it Guy? - What is it?

243
00:29:09,587 --> 00:29:13,589
一切痛苦的解药。所有问题的答案。
The cure for all suffering. The answer to all problems.

244
00:29:14,313 --> 00:29:21,923
这是通往天堂或地狱的钥匙，亲爱的……或者对虚无，毒药。
The key my darling, to heaven or to hell... or to nothingness, poison.

245
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:29,803
谢谢你，贾德森。
Thank you Judson.

246
00:29:32,552 --> 00:29:35,202
-茶点已经在餐厅准备好了，夫人。-谢谢。
- Tea is ready in the dining room milady. - Thank you.

247
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:41,389
-你怎么解释迈尔斯?-我现在还不知道
- How you explain it Miles? - Well, I don't just yet.

248
00:29:42,015 --> 00:29:47,889
然而，我冒昧地猜测，在墓地发生的那件事……把普遍的恐惧变成了一种特定的痴迷。
However, I venture to guess that the episode at the cemetery... changed the general fear into a specific obsession.

249
00:29:48,391 --> 00:29:51,540
那你不认为这是麻痹症?
Then you don't think it's catalepsy?

250
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:55,520
他以前从没发作过，对吧?是指晕厥，晕眩吗?
He's never had these attacks before, has he? Mean fainting spells, dizzy spells?

251
00:29:55,521 --> 00:30:01,143
不,不。但是他的父亲……据我们所知，癫痫并不是一种遗传疾病。
No, no. But his father... To the best of our knowledge catalepsy is not an inherited affliction.

252
00:30:02,614 --> 00:30:09,639
我们中的一些人有了新的想法，我、卡格雷夫和其他一些人……可能对盖伊的案子有所帮助。
And there's a new line of thought among some of us, myself, Cargrave, and a few others... that may shed some light on Guy's case.

253
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:17,615
你看到…大多数人倾向于认为身体和精神是完全不同的。两个独立的实体。
You see... most people tend to think of the body and the mind as being totally different... two separate entities.

254
00:30:17,935 --> 00:30:21,161
然而，事实上……它们实际上是相连的。
Whereas, in point of fact... they're actually linked.

255
00:30:21,938 --> 00:30:24,540
没有糖。你明白我的意思吗?
No sugar. Do you follow me?

256
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,976
是的，我想是的。
Yes, I think so.

257
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,026
你看，身体上……这家伙现在可能完全正常了。
You see, physically... Guy may be perfectly sound now.

258
00:30:33,725 --> 00:30:44,157
然而，这种日夜折磨着他的持续恐惧……实际上可能会导致昏睡…-现在不存在这样的条件。-我明白了。
However, this constant fear that gnaws at him night and day... may actually bring about a condition of catalepsy... - where no such condition exists now. - I see.

259
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:45,949
那么，我们能做些什么呢?
Well, what can be done?

260
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,299
我不确定。
I am not sure.

261
00:30:50,502 --> 00:30:51,559
我一点也不确定。
I'm not sure at all.

262
00:30:52,096 --> 00:31:01,166
然而，我知道盖伊的脑子就像一桶火药……最小的东西也可能点燃导火索，最无辜的死亡提醒…尸体，坟墓，任何东西。
However, I do know this that Guy's mind is like a keg of gunpowder... and the smallest thing might set the fuse, the most innocent reminder of death... corpses, graves, anything at all.

263
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,430
这是你必须记住的第一件事，明白吗?
That's the first thing you must remember, you understand?

264
00:31:04,748 --> 00:31:07,509
是的，是的，我明白。
Yes, yes I understand.

265
00:31:09,006 --> 00:31:11,498
哦，迈尔斯，我希望你能来和我们住在一起。
Oh Miles, I wish you could come and stay with us.

266
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,475
我只是在想。楼下的实验室。
Well, I was just thinking. The laboratory downstairs.

267
00:31:15,647 --> 00:31:16,647
怎么了?
What about it?

268
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:21,383
你可能知道盖伊让我用它是为了进一步研究。
Well, you may know that Guy offered me the use of it in order to further my researches.

269
00:31:21,427 --> 00:31:25,237
如果我接受他的提议，我可能会经常来这里。
If I accepted his offer, I might be able to come here from time to time.

270
00:31:25,765 --> 00:31:30,903
迈尔斯，那真是太好了。谢谢，非常感谢。
Oh Miles, that would be absolutely wonderful. Thank you, thank you very much.

271
00:31:31,921 --> 00:31:33,799
好了，我现在得走了，但我会回来的。
Well, I must go now but I'll be back.

272
00:31:36,758 --> 00:31:41,883
记住……-最小的事情，不要忘记。-我不会忘记的。
And remember... - the smallest thing, don't forget. - I won't forget.

273
00:31:46,177 --> 00:31:47,177
亲爱的艾米丽。
Dear Emily.

274
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,433
-青蛙，贾德森。-是的，先生。
- Frog please Judson. - Yes sir.

275
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,100
-您的青蛙先生-请把他放在那儿
- Your frog sir. - Oh, put him down there please.

276
00:32:12,381 --> 00:32:22,264
现在，如果我们把原电池的一端与神经接触…另一个与肌肉接触，引起肌肉收缩。
Now, if we place one terminal of the galvanic battery in contact with the nerve... and the other in contact with muscle, we cause a contraction of the muscle.

277
00:32:26,443 --> 00:32:28,530
在那里。你看到了什么?
There. You see?

278
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:35,560
现在，如果你能像控制人类大脑的反应一样容易…我对你的工作还是有点信心的。
Now, if you could control the responses of the human mind as easily as you control... the muscles of a frog I might've some faith in your work.

279
00:32:35,561 --> 00:32:38,261
总有一天，如果我们继续我们的研究，我们也许能做到。
Someday, we may be able to if we continue our research.

280
00:32:38,585 --> 00:32:41,535
-如果你继续你的工作…-不不不不
- And if you were to continue your work... - No, no, no, no.

281
00:32:41,589 --> 00:32:45,014
你知道吗，我觉得你应该努力让自己从恐惧中解脱出来。
You know, I think you should make an effort to take your mind off your fears.

282
00:32:45,015 --> 00:32:47,371
你应该离开这个地方。带艾米丽去威尼斯。
You should get away from this place. Take Emily to Venice.

283
00:32:47,372 --> 00:32:50,267
当你回来的时候，你的大部分问题都会消失。
Then when you return most of your problem would've disappeared.

284
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:51,819
也许你是对的，我会考虑的。
Perhaps you're right, I'll think about it.

285
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,220
不要想，要去做。
Don't think about it, do it.

286
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,468
好吧，我先把你留给你的小朋友们。
I may, meanwhile I'll leave you to your little friends.

287
00:32:59,583 --> 00:33:03,657
-你想继续吗，先生?-是的，贾德森。
- Do you wish to continue sir, eh? - Oh yes Judson.

288
00:33:08,818 --> 00:33:12,539
你和迈尔斯是对的。我偶尔也得出去走走。
You and Miles were right. I do have to get outside occasionally.

289
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:16,496
我告诉过你，我们只需要彼此。
I told you, all we need is each other.

290
00:33:17,448 --> 00:33:22,760
-我们不需要别的东西就能快乐。-这是真的，这是真的
- We need nothing else to be happy. - How true, how true that really is.

291
00:33:27,395 --> 00:33:28,395
这是什么?
What is it?

292
00:33:29,937 --> 00:33:30,937
听。
Listen.

293
00:33:34,072 --> 00:33:36,821
-怎么了，盖伊?-吹口哨。
- What's the matter Guy? - That whistling.

294
00:33:40,856 --> 00:33:43,106
-我什么都没听到。-听着，我告诉你
- I don't hear anything. - Listen, I tell you.

295
00:33:53,902 --> 00:33:55,768
盖，盖，别跑。
Guy, Guy don't run away.

296
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,575
的家伙。
Guy.

297
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:46,471
盖伊，盖伊，盖伊，盖伊。
Guy, Guy, Guy, Guy.

298
00:39:46,501 --> 00:39:50,303
-亲爱的，怎么了?-我看到了。
- Darling, darling, what's wrong? - I saw them.

299
00:39:50,442 --> 00:39:51,442
你看见谁了?
You saw whom?

300
00:39:51,443 --> 00:39:55,593
那两个肮脏的盗墓贼，他们是来找我的，问问爱米丽，她也看见了。
Those two filthy grave robbers, they were coming for me, ask Emily she saw them too.

301
00:39:56,637 --> 00:40:00,199
-没有，我谁也没看见。-但你一定看到了，他们从我们身边经过。
- No, I saw no one. - But you must've, they passed right by us.

302
00:40:00,627 --> 00:40:03,924
-你肯定听到了。-伙计，你太激动了。
- Surely you heard them. - Guy, you're overwrought.

303
00:40:04,604 --> 00:40:05,830
请给我。
I, please.

304
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,697
他们是冲着我来的。
They were coming for me.

305
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:12,568
-没人质疑你的话，盖伊。-别逗我，我没生气。
- No one questions your word Guy. - Don't humor me, I'm not mad.

306
00:40:12,581 --> 00:40:14,581
我看到他们就像看到你一样清楚。
I saw them as clearly as I'm seeing you.

307
00:40:14,582 --> 00:40:18,122
亲爱的，我们回家吧，你可以休息一下……那你就可以说话了。
Darling, let's go back to the house and you can rest and... well, then you can talk.

308
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,590
来吧。
Come on.

309
00:40:25,274 --> 00:40:26,504
你没看到他们?
You didn't see them?

310
00:40:27,445 --> 00:40:30,031
没有，当时又黑又多雾。
No, it was dark and foggy.

311
00:40:39,255 --> 00:40:44,359
我一会儿就去楼下找你。我只是想多休息一会儿。
I'll join you downstairs in a little while. I just want to rest some more.

312
00:40:44,768 --> 00:40:48,394
好的，亲爱的，我们都在等你。
All right darling, we'll all be waiting for you..

313
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,327
-他怎么样了艾米丽?-我觉得他好多了。
- How is he Emily? - Well, he's better I think.

314
00:41:12,357 --> 00:41:14,561
-他在休息。——好。
- He's resting. - Good.

315
00:41:14,591 --> 00:41:16,399
你觉得他看到了什么，迈尔斯?
What you think he saw Miles?

316
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,100
跟他说的一模一样，两个盗墓贼。
Exactly what he said, the two grave robbers.

317
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:23,321
-我怎么没看出来?-因为他们不是真的。
- But why didn't I see? - Because they weren't real.

318
00:41:24,155 --> 00:41:25,780
你是说，它们是超自然的东西?
You mean, they were something supernatural?

319
00:41:25,781 --> 00:41:28,181
我不否认超自然现象的可能性。
I don't deny the possibility of the supernatural.

320
00:41:28,358 --> 00:41:31,473
然而，我相信还有更合理的解释。
However, I do believe that there's a more logical explanation.

321
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:37,917
你看，艾米丽，人类的思想，是一种了不起的工具。
You see Emily, the human mind, it's a remarkable instrument.

322
00:41:38,622 --> 00:41:42,222
它可以从无到有创造出一些东西，这可能就是发生的事情。
It can create something out of nothing and that's probably what happened.

323
00:41:43,286 --> 00:41:50,712
你想说的是…-他疯了。-不，没有那种事。
Well, what you're trying to say is that... - Guy is mad. - No, nothing of the sort.

324
00:41:51,648 --> 00:41:54,701
他有心理障碍，这是有区别的。
He's disturbed and there's a difference.

325
00:41:55,315 --> 00:41:58,859
-如果他父亲过早被埋葬…-他没有。
- If his father was prematurely interred... - He wasn't.

326
00:42:00,147 --> 00:42:01,390
你怎么知道的?
How do you know?

327
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:05,118
我知道，因为我去了地下室，亲眼看到了。
I know because I went to the crypt and saw for myself.

328
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:08,187
我父亲安息了。
My father rests in peace.

329
00:44:02,143 --> 00:44:03,676
是风。
It's the wind.

330
00:44:13,352 --> 00:44:15,101
——人。-他在那儿。
- Guy. - He's there.

331
00:44:19,029 --> 00:44:21,712
-那里没人。-但你一定见过他。
- There's nobody there. - But you must've seen him.

332
00:44:22,071 --> 00:44:23,532
我只看到了你，盖伊。
I saw only you Guy.

333
00:44:36,076 --> 00:44:43,011
迈尔斯，我们该怎么办?自从那晚在荒原上，他就…我只是认不出他了。
Miles, what we going to do? Ever since that night on the moors, he's been... Well, I just don't recognize him anymore.

334
00:44:43,382 --> 00:44:46,184
-你邀请他和你一起走了吗?-我怎么能?
- Have you asked him to go away with you? - How can I?

335
00:44:46,496 --> 00:44:50,495
他不肯从那个可怕的地方出来，也不让我进去。
He won't come out of that terrible place and won't let me in.

336
00:44:52,698 --> 00:44:56,123
他只想坐着沉思。
All he wants to do is just sit and brood.

337
00:44:57,349 --> 00:45:02,495
-迈尔斯，你得做点什么。-艾米丽，我已经尽力了。
- Miles, you got to do something. - Emily, I'm afraid I've done all I can.

338
00:45:04,195 --> 00:45:10,423
总有一天，治疗心灵会成为一门科学……他们将能够处理这样的问题。
Someday, treatment of the mind will be a science... and they'll be able to cope with such problems.

339
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:16,244
但在现阶段，艾米丽有一件事我们还没试过。
But at this present stage, Emily there is one thing we haven't tried.

340
00:45:17,545 --> 00:45:20,084
那就告诉我该怎么做。
Well, just tell me what to do.

341
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:28,659
家伙?伙计，让我进去。
Guy? Guy, let me in.

342
00:45:45,857 --> 00:45:47,677
这真是个惊喜。
Well, this is quite a surprise.

343
00:45:48,492 --> 00:45:52,242
除了打扰我的工作，你这次来还有什么目的吗?
Is there any purpose to this visit apart that is, from interrupting my work?

344
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:53,906
是的。
Yes.

345
00:45:59,272 --> 00:46:02,887
-我以为你已经放弃画画了。-这只是一幅肖像画。
- Thought you'd given up painting. - It's merely portraiture.

346
00:46:03,391 --> 00:46:06,649
-假设我进入了一个新的时期。-我可以看看吗?
- Let us say I'm entering a new period. - May I see it?

347
00:46:06,888 --> 00:46:12,038
-我想你会不高兴的。-当然应该由我来决定。
- I don't think you'd find it very pleasing. - Surely I should be the one to decide that.

348
00:46:12,948 --> 00:46:15,439
好吧，别说我没警告过你。
Very well, don't say I didn't warn you.

349
00:46:21,235 --> 00:46:25,020
我虔诚地把它称为一种圆满的愿望。
I call it some consummations devoutly to be wished.

350
00:46:25,643 --> 00:46:27,750
-为什么?——思考。
- But why? - Think.

351
00:46:28,253 --> 00:46:36,989
你在这里看到的这些可怕的折磨，刑架和木桩……这整个可怕的目录难道不是真的值得虔诚地祈祷吗……
All these dreadful tortures you see depicted here, the rack and the stake... the whole ghastly catalog are they not indeed devoutly to be wished...

352
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:40,257
你宁愿接受最可怕的命运吗?
preferred to that fate which is the most terrible of all?

353
00:46:41,747 --> 00:46:43,871
这种命运已经发生了，盖伊。
That fate has already come to pass Guy.

354
00:46:44,377 --> 00:46:46,427
-你在说什么?-关于你。
- What are you talking about? - About you.

355
00:46:47,211 --> 00:46:50,478
你不怕被活埋，因为你已经被活埋了。
You don't fear burial alive because you are already buried alive.

356
00:46:51,116 --> 00:46:53,666
你到底在怕什么?被锁在坟墓里?
What is it you're afraid of? Being locked in a tomb?

357
00:46:53,784 --> 00:46:56,034
你已经被锁在坟墓里好几个月了。
Why, you've been locked in a tomb for months.

358
00:46:57,777 --> 00:46:58,915
这个坟墓。
This tomb.

359
00:47:00,308 --> 00:47:03,408
我做过你的寡妇，我不喜欢做你的寡妇，盖伊。
And I've been your widow and I don't like being your widow Guy.

360
00:47:03,409 --> 00:47:05,990
更重要的是，我不会待太久。
And what's more, I'm not going to be much longer.

361
00:47:07,293 --> 00:47:10,187
——艾米丽。-不盖伊，我是来给你个选择的
- Emily. - No Guy, I'm here to give you a choice.

362
00:47:11,247 --> 00:47:17,749
你可以选择这个，这个活死人，或者你可以选择我…但你不能两者兼得。
You can have this, this living death or you can have me... but you can't have both.

363
00:47:18,489 --> 00:47:19,489
请艾米丽。
Emily, please.

364
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:28,594
我爱你，盖伊，我非常爱你，我想照顾你……但只要你在这里，我就不能。没人能做到。
I love you Guy, I love you very much and I want to take care of you... but as long as you're here, I can't. No one can.

365
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:37,203
我知道，但是……-我好害怕。-哦，你不必做我亲爱的。
I realize that, but... - I'm so afraid. - Oh, you needn't be my darling.

366
00:47:38,012 --> 00:47:41,642
我向你保证。看着我。
I promise you. Look at me.

367
00:47:43,064 --> 00:47:51,831
我向你保证，无论发生什么…我绝不会让他们把你贬到那种地步……那个可怕的地窖。
I promise you that no matter what happens... I'll never let them take you down to that... that horrible crypt.

368
00:47:53,177 --> 00:47:58,862
-相信我能照顾好你。-我相信你，艾米丽，但不是那样
- Trust me to take care of you. - I do trust you Emily, but it isn't that.

369
00:47:58,892 --> 00:48:05,776
盖伊，如果你选择了我…那你必须摧毁这个邪恶的金库。
Guy, if you do choose me... then you must destroy this evil vault.

370
00:48:06,757 --> 00:48:10,534
把它从地球上抹去，永远从你的脑海里抹去。
Wipe it off the face of the earth and out of your mind forever.

371
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:12,963
如果你不……
If you don't...

372
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,863
那我就再也见不到你了。
then I shall never see you again.

373
00:48:20,751 --> 00:48:23,241
好吧，到底是哪一个呢?
Well, which is it to be?

374
00:48:24,737 --> 00:48:28,686
你自己去死还是和我一起生?
Death by yourself or life with me?

375
00:48:59,476 --> 00:49:00,543
艾米丽。
Emily.

376
00:49:05,608 --> 00:49:07,300
请原谅我，亲爱的。
Please forgive me darling.

377
00:49:07,631 --> 00:49:11,482
我不想失去你，我就是不能，无论如何都不能。
I wouldn't lose you, I just couldn't, not for anything.

378
00:49:11,862 --> 00:49:13,888
哦，盖伊，我爱你。
Oh Guy, I love you.

379
00:49:22,801 --> 00:49:24,370
伙计，那需要很大的勇气。
Guy, that took great courage.

380
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:30,508
不…我又一次被恐惧所驱使，害怕失去比生命更有价值的东西。
No... once again I was motivated by fear, fear of losing something more valuable than my life.

381
00:49:30,944 --> 00:49:34,750
-你永远不会后悔的。-上帝保佑你是对的。
- You'll never regret it. - I pray God you're right.

382
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:39,473
我想感谢你们二位邀请我参加婚礼。
I want to thank you both for asking me to the ceremony.

383
00:49:40,047 --> 00:49:42,747
我猜你现在要去度蜜月了，是吧?
I suppose that now you'll be having that honeymoon, eh?

384
00:49:42,819 --> 00:49:46,811
是的，但首先周五晚上会有一个小型聚会。
Yes, but first there will be a small party Friday night.

385
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,060
你会和我们在一起的，迈尔斯，对吧?
You will be with us, Miles, won't you?

386
00:49:49,061 --> 00:49:52,033
如果你父亲不打算让我继续在医院工作的话。
If your father doesn't take it into his mind to keep me working at the hospital.

387
00:49:52,034 --> 00:49:54,484
他不会的，因为我们会邀请你们两个。
Oh, he won't, because we shall invite both of you.

388
00:49:54,715 --> 00:49:56,510
那么，当然，在这种情况下。
Well then, of course, in that case.

389
00:51:09,249 --> 00:51:15,333
-凯瑟琳夫人?-老爷?
- Lady Catherine? - Mi lord?

390
00:51:32,936 --> 00:51:34,541
谢谢你，贾德森。
Thank you Judson.

391
00:51:37,655 --> 00:51:40,242
我的朋友们，为了生活。
My friends, to life.

392
00:51:46,325 --> 00:51:49,624
-高尔特医生，要来支雪茄吗?-哦，谢谢。是的。
- Dr. Gault, would you like a cigar? - Oh, thank you. Yes.

393
00:51:49,654 --> 00:51:52,217
-加入我们，迈尔斯?-等一下。
- Join us Miles? - In just a moment.

394
00:51:54,469 --> 00:51:58,769
真了不起，凯瑟琳夫人，但他看起来很健康，你不觉得吗?
It's extraordinary Lady Catherine, but he looks the picture of health, don't you agree?

395
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:01,429
外表有时会欺骗亚彻博士。
Looks can be deceiving Dr. Archer.

396
00:52:04,984 --> 00:52:05,984
谢谢你！
Thank you.

397
00:52:07,787 --> 00:52:12,667
请允许我对您的康复表示祝贺。
Well, permit me to offer my congratulations on your lordship's recovery.

398
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:16,347
我觉得你应该把它们交给艾米丽和迈尔斯，他们是有责任的。
I think you should offer them to Emily and to Miles, they are responsible.

399
00:52:18,411 --> 00:52:21,808
-好吧，神父，你玩得开心吗?-我从来都不开心。
- Well Father, are you enjoying yourself? - I never enjoy myself.

400
00:52:21,956 --> 00:52:25,356
我只是经历了或多或少的无聊，仅此而已。
I merely experience greater and lesser degrees of tedium, that's all.

401
00:52:29,964 --> 00:52:31,423
只是那只猫，亲爱的。
It's just the cat darling.

402
00:52:31,693 --> 00:52:34,747
是的，我知道，但是她为什么要那样哭呢?
Yes, I know but why should she cry like that?

403
00:52:35,066 --> 00:52:36,414
饿了吧，我想。
Hungry, I expect.

404
00:52:38,168 --> 00:52:40,519
-她在哪儿?-我不知道。
- Where is she? - I don't know.

405
00:52:40,879 --> 00:52:44,729
-听起来好像是从那边传来的。-可怜的小东西一定是被卡住了。
- Sounds as if it's coming from over there. - Poor little thing must be stuck.

406
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:45,951
等一下。
Wait a moment.

407
00:52:58,994 --> 00:52:59,994
在这里。
Is down here.

408
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,522
看这里。
Look at that, down here.

409
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:17,132
在这里，在那里。
Down here, there it is.

410
00:53:17,635 --> 00:53:20,283
好了，老伙计，我们一会儿就把你弄出来。
All right old girl, we'll have you out in a moment.

411
00:53:25,271 --> 00:53:28,471
-她是怎么到后面去的?-一定是爬过去的
- How ever could she got behind there? - Must've crawled through.

412
00:53:28,472 --> 00:53:31,604
把这可怜的小东西给我吧。
Let me have the poor wee thing.

413
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:33,846
发生了什么事啊。
What a thing to happen.

414
00:53:41,295 --> 00:53:44,983
-看到了吗?毕竟没有造成伤害。-她没事的。
- There you see? No harm done after all. - There, she's all right.

415
00:53:46,158 --> 00:53:47,715
伙计，你还好吧?
Guy, you all right?

416
00:53:49,487 --> 00:53:52,696
-如果我们没听到她的声音呢?-我们听到了。
- What if we hadn't heard her? - We did hear her.

417
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:57,154
你还没有把这些想法从脑海中抹去，是吗?
You haven't put these thoughts out of your mind after all, have you?

418
00:53:57,155 --> 00:53:58,541
哦，当然了。
Oh, of course he has.

419
00:53:58,949 --> 00:54:01,499
-这只是一种…-你没有吧?
- This is just a sort of... - You haven't, have you?

420
00:54:01,943 --> 00:54:04,197
伙计，你别再想这些了。
Guy, you got to put it out of your mind.

421
00:54:04,577 --> 00:54:08,165
我试过了，我什么都试过了。
I've tried, I've tried everything.

422
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,614
不是万能的。
Not everything.

423
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:19,001
盖伊，你对麻痹症的恐惧是…基于你认为你父亲被过早埋葬的信念，对吗?
Guy, your fear of catalepsy is... based on your belief that your father was prematurely buried, isn't that correct?

424
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:22,896
-我听到了，我听到了他的声音。-你觉得你听到了。
- I heard him, I heard his voice. - You think you heard it.

425
00:54:23,102 --> 00:54:25,957
-我听到了他的声音。-那就证明给我看
- I heard his voice. - All right, then prove it.

426
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,979
-什么意思?-证明给我看
- What do you mean? - Just that, prove it.

427
00:54:30,009 --> 00:54:32,309
带我去地下室，让我看看他的尸体。
Take me down to the crypt and show me his body.

428
00:54:33,874 --> 00:54:36,024
-不行。-因为你知道那不是真的。
- I can't. - Because you know it isn't true.

429
00:54:36,025 --> 00:54:37,025
——没有。——是的。
- No. - Yes.

430
00:54:37,072 --> 00:54:38,789
不然你为什么会逃避呢?
Why else you think you've avoided it?

431
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:42,418
因为你害怕，害怕这种恐惧只不过是你大脑的一个把戏。
Because you're afraid, afraid that this fear is nothing more than a trick of your mind.

432
00:54:42,419 --> 00:54:44,774
我愿意付出任何代价去查明那是不是真的。
I'd give anything to find out if that were true.

433
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,740
好吧，带我下楼。
All right then, take me downstairs.

434
00:54:53,201 --> 00:54:56,413
好吧，我会的。
All right, I will.

435
00:54:56,570 --> 00:55:01,479
-不，盖伊，你不觉得你应该休息一下吗?——艾米丽……迈尔斯说得对，我已经拖得够久了。
- No Guy, don't you think you should rest? - Emily... Miles is right, I've put this off long enough.

436
00:55:42,022 --> 00:55:45,554
-地窖的钥匙不见了-谁能拿到这些?
- The key to the crypt, it's gone. - Who has access to these?

437
00:55:46,437 --> 00:55:48,918
-只有我自己。-但你一直锁着?
- No one but myself. - But you keep it locked?

438
00:55:49,183 --> 00:55:53,659
没有,但是……盖伊，你是下来拿钥匙的吗?
No, but... Guy, did you come down here and take the key?

439
00:55:53,685 --> 00:55:54,813
我不这么想。
I don't think so.

440
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,500
有人可能做了那样的事却不记得吗?
Is it possible for someone to do a thing like that and not remember it?

441
00:55:59,501 --> 00:56:03,301
有可能，你承认最近做了很多你不记得的事情。
It's possible, you admit to doing many things lately that you don't remember.

442
00:56:03,574 --> 00:56:05,977
这不重要，把它打开。
Well, it's unimportant, break it open.

443
00:56:18,738 --> 00:56:19,738
跟我来。
Follow me.

444
00:56:28,961 --> 00:56:35,538
-是哪一个?-在那边。
- Which one is it? - Over there.

445
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:44,915
-不行。-你最喜欢。
- I can't. - You most.

446
00:56:45,161 --> 00:56:49,028
这是你唯一的机会，如果你现在失败了你将永远被困扰。
Is your only chance, if you fail now you'll be haunted forever.

447
00:57:30,203 --> 00:57:31,488
凯特，给我一面镜子。
Kate, bring me a mirror.

448
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,239
你在浪费时间，他已经死了。
You're wasting your time, he's dead.

449
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:46,592
不。不，他不可能。不能。
No. No, he can't be. Can't be.

450
00:58:05,477 --> 00:58:06,478
他完成了。
He's finished.

451
00:58:07,557 --> 00:58:09,146
-心脏病发作。-哦，不。
- Heart attack. - Oh, no.

452
00:58:09,343 --> 00:58:11,951
-你确定吗，高尔特医生?-当然了。
- Are you sure, Dr. Gault? - Of course I am.

453
00:58:11,981 --> 00:58:15,487
没有，没有生命迹象但为了确保万无一失我们应该再做一次测试。
No, there's no sign of life but to be absolutely sure we should make one more test.

454
00:58:15,488 --> 00:58:17,764
愚蠢的阿切尔，那人死了。
Foolishness Archer, the man is dead.

455
00:58:17,931 --> 00:58:20,031
贾德森，帮我拿原电池。
Judson, help me with the galvanic battery.

456
00:58:20,032 --> 00:58:24,766
不，别这样，听我说。我还活着，你听不见我吗?
No, don't do this, listen to me. I'm alive, can't you hear me?

457
00:58:24,796 --> 00:58:27,009
我还活着，还活着。
I'm alive, I'm alive.

458
00:58:33,611 --> 00:58:35,711
凯特，你和艾米丽最好离开房间。
Kate, you and Emily better leave the room.

459
00:58:38,992 --> 00:58:43,245
迈尔斯，迈尔斯，看在上帝的份上。
Oh, Miles, Miles, in the name of heaven.

460
00:59:14,359 --> 00:59:16,998
好吗?他死了还是没死?
Well? Is he dead or isn't he?

461
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:23,482
-是的。-不，我没死，我还活着。
- He is. - No, I'm not dead, I', alive.

462
00:59:28,513 --> 00:59:30,163
贾德森，帮我拿电池。
Judson, help me with the battery.

463
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,001
我们还是把他带回墓穴吧。
We may as well take him back to the crypt.

464
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:41,942
不，我答应过他无论发生什么我都不会让他们把他带到地下墓穴。
No, I promised him no matter what happens I'd never let them take him down to the crypt.

465
00:59:41,972 --> 00:59:48,818
艾米丽的废话。好吧，这是你的决定。
Nonsense Emily. Oh well, is your decision.

466
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:59,507
女人所生的男人寿命很短，而且充满苦难。
Man that is born of woman hath but a short time to live and is full of misery.

467
00:59:59,537 --> 01:00:02,800
他上来，像花一样被砍倒。
He cometh up and is cut down like a flower.

468
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:07,326
他像影子一样逃窜，永不停留。
He fleeth as it were a shadow and never continueth in one stay.

469
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:10,778
在生命中，我们在死亡中。
In the midst of life, we are in death.

470
01:00:11,213 --> 01:00:17,509
除了你，我们还能向谁寻求帮助呢?谁因我们的罪有正当的不喜悦呢?
Of whom may we seek for succor but of thee dear Lord... who for our sins art justly displeased?

471
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,928
然而，万能的上帝啊。
Yet, oh Lord God most mighty.

472
01:00:19,958 --> 01:00:26,483
哦，神圣而仁慈的救世主，不要让我们陷入永恒死亡的痛苦之中。
Oh holy and most merciful savior deliver us not into the bitter pain of eternal death.

473
01:00:26,872 --> 01:00:29,368
主啊，你知道我们心中的秘密。
Thou knowest Lord the secrets of our hearts.

474
01:00:29,411 --> 01:00:34,387
不要对你的祈祷闭上仁慈的耳朵，宽恕我们吧，最强大的上帝。
Shut not thy merciful ears to thy prayers but spare us, God most mighty.

475
01:00:34,723 --> 01:00:44,571
啊，最仁慈的救主，你最配得上永恒的审判者……在我们最后的时刻，不要让任何死亡的痛苦从你身上降临。
O most merciful savior, thou most worthy judge eternal... suffer us not at our last hour for any pains of death to fall from thee.

476
01:00:44,611 --> 01:00:46,543
不要让我们受苦。
Suffer us not.

477
01:00:48,738 --> 01:00:54,724
死亡的痛苦。哦，求你了，帮帮我。谁来帮帮我。
Pains of death. Oh please, help me. Someone, help me.

478
01:00:55,021 --> 01:00:56,087
帮助我。
Help me.

479
01:00:56,492 --> 01:00:57,584
阿们。
Amen.

480
01:01:00,331 --> 01:01:02,084
你现在可以说再见了。
You may say farewell now.

481
01:01:11,809 --> 01:01:13,648
再见，亲爱的。
Good-bye my darling.

482
01:01:13,955 --> 01:01:19,118
艾米丽，艾米丽，回来。回来了。
Emily, Emily come back. Come back.

483
01:01:43,872 --> 01:01:46,853
他们会看到我，他们会看着我的眼睛。
They'll see me, they'll look at my eyes.

484
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:52,228
他们不会带我去地下室的。但是，他们要带我去哪里?
They're not taking me to the crypt. But, where are they taking me?

485
01:01:52,553 --> 01:01:56,156
在哪里?在哪里?为什么我动不了?
Where? Where? Why can't I move?

486
01:01:56,186 --> 01:01:59,585
天啊，为什么我动不了?
Oh God, why can't I move?

487
01:02:22,025 --> 01:02:30,212
仁慈的上帝啊，我们将盖伊·卡雷尔的灵魂…吉迪恩和阿加莎·卡雷尔的儿子，愿你永远照顾他。
O merciful God, we consign the soul of Guy Carrell... son of Gideon and Agatha Carrell to thine eternal care.

488
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:32,315
阿们。
Amen.

489
01:02:50,577 --> 01:02:52,723
看着我，有人，看着我。
Look at me, someone, look at me.

490
01:02:52,753 --> 01:02:56,686
看在上帝的份上，求你了。你不能活埋我。
Oh, for God's sake, please. You can't bury me alive.

491
01:02:56,716 --> 01:02:58,728
难道你看不见我还活着吗?
Can't you see I'm alive?

492
01:02:58,914 --> 01:03:02,721
天啊，为什么我动不了?为什么我动不了?
God, why can't I move? Why can't I move?

493
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:09,097
不,不。帮助我。
No, no. Help me.

494
01:03:09,623 --> 01:03:15,616
谁来帮帮我。我还活着，你听不见我吗?你看不见我的眼睛吗?
Someone help me. I'm alive, can't you hear me? Can't you see my eyes?

495
01:03:26,732 --> 01:03:29,694
我还活着，活着，艾莉…
I'm alive, alive, Ali...

496
01:03:33,678 --> 01:03:37,593
我想你会在读完遗嘱后离开。
You'll be leaving I suppose, after the reading of the will.

497
01:03:37,965 --> 01:03:39,172
你为什么这么说?
Why should you say that?

498
01:03:40,173 --> 01:03:41,625
没有理由。
No reason.

499
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:46,468
我只是想，在这种情况下，你可能会觉得这房子很令人不安。
I merely thought that under the circumstances you might find this house rather disturbing.

500
01:03:47,246 --> 01:03:48,596
我是说对你的良心。
To your conscience, I mean.

501
01:03:48,826 --> 01:03:51,973
凯特，你是在暗示艾米丽对盖伊的死有任何责任吗?
Kate, are you implying that Emily is in any way responsible for Guy's death?

502
01:03:51,974 --> 01:03:53,083
没有人对此负责。
No one is responsible.

503
01:03:53,535 --> 01:03:56,735
他死于休克引起的心脏病发作，你不明白吗?
He died of a heart attack induced by shock, don't you understand?

504
01:03:56,736 --> 01:03:59,095
是的。我明白了。
Yes. I understand.

505
01:03:59,392 --> 01:04:01,592
事实是他自己带来了震惊。
The fact is he brought on the shock himself.

506
01:04:01,865 --> 01:04:05,204
地窖里的那一幕还有其他所有的事，都是精心策划的，你不明白吗?
The episode in the crypt and all the others, they were planned, contrived, don't you see?

507
01:04:05,205 --> 01:04:08,481
——计划?由谁?-盖伊自己写的。
- Planned? By whom? - By Guy himself.

508
01:04:09,393 --> 01:04:12,215
他想以一种奇怪的方式死去。
In a strange way he wanted to die.

509
01:04:12,532 --> 01:04:16,368
别再谈论他了。别再谈论他了。
Stop talking about him. Stop talking about him.

510
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:43,414
-太过分了，斯威尼先生。鼹鼠先生是什么?
- That's a bit much Mr. Sweeney. - What is Mr. Mole?

511
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:46,390
那位老先生派我们来挖这个的。
The old gentleman sending us out here to dig up this one.

512
01:04:46,391 --> 01:04:50,417
-我是说他的女婿-尸体都差不多啊。
- I mean, his own son in law. - Well, one stiff's pretty much like another.

513
01:04:50,997 --> 01:04:53,697
哦，我们找到线索了。那该死的撬棍在哪?
Oh, we've struck wood. Now, where's the bloody crowbar?

514
01:04:53,999 --> 01:04:55,755
我记得我把它落在上面了。
I believe I left it up on top.

515
01:04:55,785 --> 01:04:58,785
鼹鼠先生，你能帮我把它拿下来吗?
Well Mr. Mole, would you do me the kindness to fetch it down?

516
01:04:58,786 --> 01:05:00,444
好的，斯威尼先生。
Yes, I will Mr. Sweeney.

517
01:05:34,475 --> 01:05:38,763
-我找到了，斯威尼先生——嗯?不。
- I found it Mr. Sweeney. - Eh? No.

518
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:44,279
不，我从没对你做过什么。请,请。
No, I never did nothing to you. Please, please.

519
01:05:44,309 --> 01:05:46,748
我从没对你做过什么，求你了。
I've never done nothing to you, please.

520
01:06:16,374 --> 01:06:21,317
斯威尼，你这个喋喋不休的白痴。什么你…我让你带他去我的住处。
Sweeney, you blithering idiot. What you... I told you to take him to my quarters.

521
01:06:21,931 --> 01:06:25,308
好吧，还是现在就去看看他吧。
Oh well, may as well have a look at him now, yes.

522
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:33,619
很讽刺，你不觉得吗?非常合适。
Ironic, don't you think? And rather fitting really.

523
01:06:33,883 --> 01:06:37,954
盖伊·卡雷尔一生对医学毫无贡献。
In life, Guy Carrell contributed nothing to medical science.

524
01:06:38,649 --> 01:06:41,787
死后，他将为之尽忠职守。
In death, he shall serve it admirably.

525
01:06:44,852 --> 01:06:46,074
斯威尼?
Sweeney?

526
01:06:49,571 --> 01:06:52,301
不，你死了，不……
No, you're dead, no...

527
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:37,140
艾米丽，你什么毛病都没有。
Emily, there's nothing whatever wrong with you.

528
01:07:37,738 --> 01:07:41,023
嗯，也许不是身体上的。
Well, not physically perhaps.

529
01:07:42,169 --> 01:07:49,212
-那你为什么派贾德森来找我?-我害怕一个人呆着。
- Then why did you send Judson for me? - Well, I was afraid to be alone.

530
01:07:50,506 --> 01:07:52,518
哦，我，我能理解。
Oh, I, I can understand that.

531
01:07:53,715 --> 01:07:58,553
-也许你不该来这里。-哦，迈尔斯，你不明白吗?
- Perhaps you shouldn't be here. - Oh Miles, don't you see...

532
01:08:02,577 --> 01:08:06,745
请过来坐下。好吗?
Please come and sit down. Please?

533
01:08:14,817 --> 01:08:17,417
现在，就一会儿，然后你必须去睡觉。
Now, just for a moment and then you must go to sleep.

534
01:08:19,369 --> 01:08:33,164
迈尔斯，你一定知道，或者至少你一定感觉到……我今天一直很担心……我需要某件事或某个人给我安慰。
Miles, you must know or at least you must sense that... I've been very worried today... that I'm in need of something or someone to give me solace.

535
01:08:35,535 --> 01:08:37,907
你和我曾经很亲密，迈尔斯。
You and I were very close once Miles.

536
01:08:39,391 --> 01:08:40,897
你还记得吧?
You remember that, don't you?

537
01:08:42,026 --> 01:08:49,642
我记得有个医学院学生穷得像教堂里的老鼠…一个想成为伟大女士的女孩。
I can remember a medical student who was poor as a church mouse... and a girl who wanted to be a great lady.

538
01:08:51,655 --> 01:08:53,739
我很愚蠢。
I was very foolish.

539
01:08:56,110 --> 01:09:03,416
-哦，迈尔斯，也许我们现在还不算太晚。-但是艾米丽…
- Oh Miles, maybe it's not too late for us. - But Emily...

540
01:09:06,937 --> 01:09:08,398
我犯了一个错误。
I made a mistake.

541
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:14,457
这有那么错吗?
Is that so very wrong?

542
01:09:18,386 --> 01:09:19,727
进来。
Come in.

543
01:09:20,717 --> 01:09:22,367
-亚彻博士?-怎么了，贾德森?
- Dr. Archer? - What is it Judson?

544
01:09:22,368 --> 01:09:24,417
对不起，女士。
It's, excuse me milady.

545
01:09:24,871 --> 01:09:27,471
如果你愿意的话，我想让你看看这个。
It's something I'd like you to see sir, if you would.

546
01:09:27,472 --> 01:09:28,728
-医疗问题?——是的。
- A medical matter? - Yes.

547
01:09:28,758 --> 01:09:31,358
那高尔特医生肯定能搞定。
Well, then certainly Dr. Gault could take care of it.

548
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:34,901
我想高尔特医生会希望你尽快过来的，先生。
I think Dr. Gault would want you to come as quickly as possible sir.

549
01:09:34,919 --> 01:09:36,519
也许你最好去迈尔斯。
Perhaps you had better go Miles.

550
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:39,384
来吧，贾德森。
Now come along Judson.

551
01:09:46,055 --> 01:09:47,905
贾德森，你怎么这么奇怪?
Judson why are you behaving so oddly?

552
01:09:47,927 --> 01:09:56,364
我听到实验室有声音，先生，就在刚才，然后……——是吗?-你自己看吧，先生。
I heard a sound from the laboratory sir, just a bit ago and... - Yes? - See for yourself sir.

553
01:10:03,712 --> 01:10:06,813
那是谁?英里?
Who's that? Miles?

554
01:10:12,267 --> 01:10:13,483
不欢迎?
No welcome?

555
01:10:14,974 --> 01:10:16,485
没有快乐吗?
No rejoicing?

556
01:10:17,604 --> 01:10:18,713
没有吻吗?
No kiss?

557
01:10:31,986 --> 01:10:34,598
-电致死亡。-亚彻博士…
- Killed by electrical force. - Dr. Archer...

558
01:10:38,503 --> 01:10:39,621
这是《理发师陶德》。
That's Sweeney.

559
01:10:52,110 --> 01:10:53,110
艾米丽。
Emily.

560
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:58,007
艾米丽?
Emily?

561
01:12:07,331 --> 01:12:08,380
的家伙。
Guy.

562
01:12:10,697 --> 01:12:11,806
的家伙。
Guy.

563
01:12:14,514 --> 01:12:17,273
现在…伙计，你得听我说。
Now... Guy, you got to listen to me.

564
01:12:17,562 --> 01:12:22,269
什么?更多的谎言吗?更多的欺骗吗?更多的背叛?
To what? More lies? More deceit? More treachery?

565
01:12:22,299 --> 01:12:25,364
-不，不，不是这样的-哦，但它是。
- No, no, that's not true. - Oh, but it is.

566
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:29,244
你很聪明，艾米丽，很聪明。
You were very clever Emily, very clever.

567
01:12:30,118 --> 01:12:36,141
-在某种程度上，我很抱歉破坏了你的计划。-我没有安排，是凯特。
- In a way I'm sorry to spoil your plans. - Oh, I had no plans, it was Kate.

568
01:12:38,031 --> 01:12:39,831
你不会杀了我吧，盖伊?
You wouldn't kill me, would you Guy?

569
01:12:39,832 --> 01:12:44,952
不，亲爱的，一点也不，就像你没有杀我一样。
No darling, not at all, just as you didn't kill me.

570
01:12:45,225 --> 01:12:48,168
你不会让谋杀弄脏你漂亮的手的。
You wouldn't soil your pretty hands with murder.

571
01:12:48,598 --> 01:12:52,097
不，你只是袖手旁观，让他们把我活埋。
No, you just stood aside and let them bury me alive.

572
01:12:52,277 --> 01:12:54,177
不，伙计，不。
No Guy, no.

573
01:12:54,376 --> 01:12:57,687
所以，我不会杀你。
And so, I shall not kill you.

574
01:12:58,423 --> 01:13:06,379
我将把这可悲的任务留给大地和黑暗……还有你内心的恐惧。
That sorry task I shall leave to the earth and the darkness... and the terrified pounding of your own heart.

575
01:13:20,559 --> 01:13:22,675
盖伊，不，不是那个。
Guy no, not that.

576
01:13:22,705 --> 01:13:27,733
是的，我美丽的，背信弃义的，背信弃义的爱人。
Yes, my beautiful, my perfidious, my treacherous love, that.

577
01:13:40,931 --> 01:13:42,832
没有人。
No Guy.

578
01:13:55,724 --> 01:13:56,797
的家伙。
Guy.

579
01:14:00,138 --> 01:14:04,599
待在原地别动，迈尔斯。我无意伤害你。
Stay precisely where you are Miles. I've no desire to harm you.

580
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:08,632
-你做了什么，盖伊?-偿还了一笔长期债务。
- What have you done Guy? - Paid a debt of long standing.

581
01:14:09,307 --> 01:14:14,519
不，这与你无关。今晚早些时候我发现的。
No, this has nothing to do with you. I found that out earlier this evening.

582
01:14:14,549 --> 01:14:18,725
-天哪，盖伊。-是的，以上帝的名义。
- In heaven's name Guy. - Yes, in heaven's name.

583
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:20,748
把铲子给我。
Give me that shovel.

584
01:15:52,259 --> 01:15:53,562
她死了。
She's dead.

585
01:15:55,202 --> 01:15:58,237
-谢天谢地。-凯特，你在说什么?
- Thank God. - Kate, what are you saying?

586
01:16:00,015 --> 01:16:05,227
你这么瞎吗?你看不出来吗?
Are you so blind? Can't you see?

587
01:16:09,995 --> 01:16:14,471
-那是地窖的钥匙。-她没时间换新的
- That's the key to the crypt. - She had no time to replace it.

588
01:16:17,123 --> 01:16:21,060
-我真不敢相信艾米丽-是的，艾米丽
- I can't believe it, not Emily. - Yes, Emily.

589
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:25,880
可爱，美丽，温柔的艾米丽。
Sweet, beautiful, gentle Emily.

590
01:16:27,223 --> 01:16:33,092
一旦你告诉她利用盖伊的恐惧来杀死他是多么容易，她就去工作了。
Once you told her how easy it would be to use Guy's fear to kill him, she went to work.

591
01:16:38,002 --> 01:16:49,667
首先，雇佣盗墓贼来折磨他……墙里的猫……最后是亵渎我们父亲的坟墓。
First, the hiring of the grave robbers to torment him... the cat in the wall... and finally the desecration of our father's tomb.

592
01:16:51,978 --> 01:17:00,876
哦的家伙…我知道她在做什么，我想告诉你，但你不会相信我的。
Oh Guy... I knew what she was doing and I wanted to tell you but you wouldn't have believed me.

593
01:17:02,196 --> 01:17:07,286
我不得不等待证据。你看得出来，不是吗?
I had to wait for proof. You can see that, can't you?

594
01:17:09,078 --> 01:17:14,584
但我等得太久了。我来晚了。
But I waited too long. I was too late.

595
01:17:17,619 --> 01:17:19,227
太晚了
Too late.
