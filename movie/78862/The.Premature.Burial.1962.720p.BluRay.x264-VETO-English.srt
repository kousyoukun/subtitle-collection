1
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,712
Good afternoon, Miss Gault.

2
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:32,981
Good afternoon, Judson.
I'd like to see--

3
00:03:35,823 --> 00:03:37,017
Hello, Kate.

4
00:03:37,058 --> 00:03:38,491
What do you want?

5
00:03:38,526 --> 00:03:40,494
Will you tell Guy that
I would like to see him?

6
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,254
I'm afraid he doesn't
Wish to see you.

7
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,733
I shall have to hear
that from Guy himself.

8
00:03:48,736 --> 00:03:50,260
Oh, really, Kate,
don't you think...

9
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:52,101
at least I deserve
an explanation?

10
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:56,270
Very well.

11
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,275
Will you please wait here?

12
00:04:28,378 --> 00:04:29,743
I'm sorry.

13
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:32,009
Guy does not wish to see you.

14
00:04:32,882 --> 00:04:35,407
I told you I'd have to hear
that from Guy himself.

15
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:44,316
Guy?

16
00:04:47,564 --> 00:04:48,792
Emily.

17
00:04:53,237 --> 00:04:54,363
Emily, you--

18
00:04:54,405 --> 00:04:56,202
you shouldn't have come here.

19
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,605
So I understand.

20
00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:01,037
But, Guy, don't you think
I deserve something...

21
00:05:01,078 --> 00:05:02,909
a little more than a letter?

22
00:05:04,214 --> 00:05:06,614
Look at me and tell me
you don't love me.

23
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,053
My darling,
I do love you--very much.

24
00:05:10,088 --> 00:05:12,283
That's why I sent you
that letter...

25
00:05:12,324 --> 00:05:14,622
because I do love you.

26
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:18,959
Now, darling, please go away
and forget you ever met me.

27
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:21,890
I know what happened, Guy.

28
00:05:23,368 --> 00:05:24,801
My father told me.

29
00:05:26,638 --> 00:05:29,106
Did he tell you why?

30
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,801
Despite what he thinks...

31
00:05:29,842 --> 00:05:33,141
I didn't run away from what
Was inside that coffin...

32
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:35,670
but from what I knew
to be inside me.

33
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:38,240
I--I don't understand.

34
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:40,979
I'd hoped to spare you this.

35
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,818
If you do understand,
then you'll realize...

36
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:46,381
Why there can never be
a marriage between us.

37
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,859
Come with me.

38
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:04,533
Where does this lead?

39
00:06:04,578 --> 00:06:05,670
Below.

40
00:06:47,923 --> 00:06:49,015
Are you all right?

41
00:06:50,225 --> 00:06:52,022
Yes, I--I think so.

42
00:06:52,528 --> 00:06:54,155
Do you want to go back?

43
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:56,426
No. No.

44
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:06,936
You've often expressed a wish
to meet the rest of my family.

45
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:08,409
Well, here they are--

46
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:12,677
all my ancestors,
famous and infamous...

47
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:15,616
Iaid here to--
What is the term?

48
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:16,812
To rest.

49
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:23,321
From the beginning,
death has come...

50
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,987
to the Carrells
like an assassin...

51
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,521
but the least fortunate
of all was my father.

52
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:29,863
How did he die?

53
00:07:30,935 --> 00:07:34,803
Like a single candle
in a dark and airless room.

54
00:07:35,673 --> 00:07:36,662
Emily, my father--

55
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:37,867
Guy.

56
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:41,036
Kate, why are you here?

57
00:07:41,078 --> 00:07:42,670
It's time for your medicine.

58
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:45,147
Oh, yes. I'd forgotten.
I'm sorry. Thank you.

59
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:46,376
What medicine?

60
00:07:51,823 --> 00:07:52,983
Laudanum.

61
00:07:54,993 --> 00:07:56,221
Guy, is this the cause of--

62
00:07:56,261 --> 00:07:58,786
No. Not a cause. An effect.

63
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,354
Without it, I couldn't sleep.

64
00:08:04,035 --> 00:08:05,400
Guy, tell me.

65
00:08:06,972 --> 00:08:08,769
I should never have gone
With your father...

66
00:08:08,807 --> 00:08:10,297
and those other doctors
that night.

67
00:08:10,342 --> 00:08:13,209
I'm interested only
in private research.

68
00:08:13,245 --> 00:08:15,009
I can never forget
that poor wretch...

69
00:08:15,047 --> 00:08:16,480
Whose grave they robbed.

70
00:08:18,184 --> 00:08:20,414
His staring eyes...

71
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:23,183
his clutching hands...

72
00:08:23,222 --> 00:08:25,656
his fingernails
broken and bloody...

73
00:08:25,691 --> 00:08:27,283
from the vain attempt
to claw away...

74
00:08:27,326 --> 00:08:28,759
the lid of that coffin.

75
00:08:30,062 --> 00:08:33,498
You see, all this has
a special meaning for me, Emily.

76
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:36,694
For years,
I've lived in dread...

77
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:37,601
of being buried alive.

78
00:08:40,474 --> 00:08:43,238
Can you possibly conceive it?

79
00:08:44,478 --> 00:08:47,641
The unendurable
oppression of the lungs...

80
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:51,545
the stifling fumes
of the damp earth...

81
00:08:51,585 --> 00:08:54,281
the rigid embrace
of the coffin...

82
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:56,881
the blackness
of absolute night...

83
00:08:58,492 --> 00:08:59,891
and the silence...

84
00:09:00,261 --> 00:09:02,229
Iike an overwhelming sea.

85
00:09:03,364 --> 00:09:06,527
And then,
invisible in the darkness...

86
00:09:06,568 --> 00:09:09,696
but all too hideously real
to the other senses--

87
00:09:09,737 --> 00:09:12,535
the presence
of the conqueror worm.

88
00:09:12,574 --> 00:09:13,734
Guy!

89
00:09:18,813 --> 00:09:20,303
I'm sorry.

90
00:09:20,348 --> 00:09:22,714
These are just morbid fantasies.

91
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,081
I'm afraid not.

92
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:24,517
Every member of my family...

93
00:09:24,553 --> 00:09:27,579
has met with a violent
and horrible death.

94
00:09:27,623 --> 00:09:29,420
I now wait my turn.

95
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,619
How did your father die?

96
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,355
Catalepsy.

97
00:09:33,395 --> 00:09:34,987
Do you know what that is?

98
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:40,032
When it strikes...

99
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:43,334
the victim gives every
outward sign of being dead.

100
00:09:43,372 --> 00:09:46,933
But he's not dead. He's alive.

101
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:51,506
I was barely 13
When my father was stricken.

102
00:09:51,548 --> 00:09:54,381
Doctor said
it was a heart attack...

103
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:55,714
and there was a funeral...

104
00:09:57,454 --> 00:09:59,752
and he was sealed in this vault.

105
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:03,520
That night...

106
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:06,759
I heard him crying out--

107
00:10:06,796 --> 00:10:09,822
a pitiful, desperate cry.

108
00:10:09,866 --> 00:10:10,697
I begged with them.
I pleaded with them.

109
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,430
"He's alive.
He's alive," I said...

110
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,267
but no one would believe me.

111
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:16,000
Because it wasn't true.

112
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,234
It was!

113
00:10:22,546 --> 00:10:23,877
I heard him.

114
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,712
In your mind.

115
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,047
No, Kate.

116
00:10:27,618 --> 00:10:30,018
It would be easier
for me to accept that.

117
00:10:30,655 --> 00:10:32,179
But I know the truth.

118
00:10:32,223 --> 00:10:34,691
God help me,
I know the truth!

119
00:10:50,142 --> 00:10:53,600
My father's inheritance
and my wedding gift to you--

120
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:54,805
catalepsy.

121
00:10:55,414 --> 00:10:57,644
Now you know why
I asked your forgiveness.

122
00:10:57,683 --> 00:10:57,945
There's nothing to forgive.

123
00:10:57,984 --> 00:10:59,144
But you must understand--

124
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:00,743
I understand
that I love you...

125
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:02,152
and that I want
to be your wife.

126
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:03,314
Miss Gault...

127
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:05,890
My brother is ill.

128
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:07,790
Then I shall nurse him
back to health.

129
00:11:07,827 --> 00:11:08,885
Emily--

130
00:11:08,928 --> 00:11:10,759
Guy, if you love me--
if you really love me--

131
00:11:10,797 --> 00:11:12,492
you won't shut me out
of your life.

132
00:11:12,532 --> 00:11:14,261
You'll let me share it with you.

133
00:11:15,268 --> 00:11:16,360
You want that?

134
00:11:16,903 --> 00:11:18,302
After what you've heard?

135
00:11:19,005 --> 00:11:20,370
More than ever before.

136
00:11:22,743 --> 00:11:24,108
Tell her, Guy.

137
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:26,040
Tell her.

138
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:33,009
Kate...

139
00:11:33,821 --> 00:11:35,516
you've been most considerate...

140
00:11:35,556 --> 00:11:38,548
and you've always
thought of my welfare.

141
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:40,059
That is true.

142
00:11:40,094 --> 00:11:43,188
But in some things,
I must make my own decisions.

143
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,390
Of course.

144
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:48,698
Then I take it you have
made your decision?

145
00:11:49,571 --> 00:11:50,765
I have.

146
00:11:53,608 --> 00:11:55,735
Then let it be
on your own head.

147
00:12:07,288 --> 00:12:07,414
Do you, Guy...

148
00:12:07,456 --> 00:12:10,323
take Emily to be your
lawful wedded wife...

149
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:13,522
for better, for worse,
in sickness and in health...

150
00:12:13,562 --> 00:12:15,496
So long as ye both shall live?

151
00:12:15,531 --> 00:12:16,759
I do.

152
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:19,632
Do you, Emily, take Guy...

153
00:12:19,668 --> 00:12:21,431
to be your lawful
Wedded husband...

154
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,062
for better, for worse...

155
00:12:23,105 --> 00:12:24,629
in sickness and in health...

156
00:12:24,673 --> 00:12:26,903
So long as ye both shall live?

157
00:12:26,942 --> 00:12:28,068
I do.

158
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,704
If there be any here
Who know just cause...

159
00:12:30,746 --> 00:12:32,010
Why these two should
not be joined together...

160
00:12:32,048 --> 00:12:33,379
in holy matrimony...

161
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,317
Iet him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

162
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,924
The ring, please.

163
00:12:45,862 --> 00:12:47,454
Repeat after me.

164
00:12:47,497 --> 00:12:50,193
With this ring, I thee wed.

165
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:57,736
Then I do pronounce you
man and wife.

166
00:13:09,487 --> 00:13:10,545
Champagne, Lady Catherine?

167
00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:11,612
Thank you.

168
00:13:12,824 --> 00:13:14,815
Oh, yes, a beautiful ceremony.

169
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:18,487
A toast...to the most
beautiful bride...

170
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:19,793
and the most fortunate
groom who ever lived.

171
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,857
May they be happy
to the end of their days.

172
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,763
No, Guy. Not in front
of everyone.

173
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,342
Well, then, you'd better
go and play something...

174
00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:33,571
before I lose control
completely.

175
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,246
Isn't she beautiful?

176
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:39,443
Very.

177
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,653
Are you enjoying
yourself, father?

178
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:46,852
Hmm?

179
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,787
Don't stop playing, Emily.
It's lovely.

180
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,827
I want to wish you
every happiness.

181
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,503
Thank you, Miles.

182
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,407
You're going to Venice...

183
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,272
for the honeymoon, I understand.

184
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:09,843
What was that? I--I'm sorry.

185
00:14:09,884 --> 00:14:13,479
I inquired if you were going
to Venice for your honeymoon...

186
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,078
and I'm not accustomed
to people--

187
00:14:16,257 --> 00:14:17,417
Carrell!

188
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:23,429
Forgive me, please.

189
00:14:24,732 --> 00:14:27,064
What the devil's
the matter with the fella?

190
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:29,567
-Emily.
-Yes, darling?

191
00:14:29,604 --> 00:14:32,072
That melody you're playing--
What is it?

192
00:14:32,107 --> 00:14:34,575
"Molly Malone."
Don't you like it?

193
00:14:34,609 --> 00:14:36,941
No. Please stop playing.

194
00:14:36,978 --> 00:14:38,775
But it's a charming melody.

195
00:14:38,813 --> 00:14:40,508
I said please stop playing it!

196
00:14:44,152 --> 00:14:45,414
I'm sorry. I...

197
00:14:52,328 --> 00:14:53,420
Is there anything I can do, Guy?

198
00:14:53,462 --> 00:14:54,622
No, nothing.

199
00:14:54,664 --> 00:14:55,631
I'll come with you, Guy.

200
00:14:55,665 --> 00:14:56,757
No. Please leave me alone!

201
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:59,324
All of you,
leave me alone, please!

202
00:15:38,977 --> 00:15:41,343
Guy. Guy, darling.

203
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:44,371
Please wake up.
They've all gone now.

204
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:46,275
Yes, Emily.

205
00:15:50,822 --> 00:15:52,187
Are you feeling better?

206
00:15:53,024 --> 00:15:54,184
I think so.

207
00:15:57,328 --> 00:15:58,920
What's the matter, Guy?

208
00:15:59,764 --> 00:16:01,698
What happened to you down there?

209
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,998
I can't remember, exactly.

210
00:16:04,903 --> 00:16:07,371
I was talking with
your father, and then--

211
00:16:07,406 --> 00:16:08,532
And then what?

212
00:16:09,308 --> 00:16:10,866
The music.

213
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:13,070
Something about the music
you were playing.

214
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:15,444
What was it about the music?

215
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:20,009
It was the tune
he was whistling that night.

216
00:16:20,052 --> 00:16:21,485
Who was?

217
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,748
There were two of them.

218
00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:25,884
Sweeney and Mole
Were their names.

219
00:16:25,924 --> 00:16:28,587
Oh, filthy,
disgusting creatures.

220
00:16:28,628 --> 00:16:31,392
They were the ones
Who opened the grave...

221
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:35,333
and all the time whistling
that loathsome tune.

222
00:16:36,469 --> 00:16:37,731
Darling...

223
00:16:39,072 --> 00:16:40,539
Now we're alone.

224
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:42,566
Alone.

225
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:44,767
Just the two of us.

226
00:16:45,945 --> 00:16:47,276
Together.

227
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,349
What was that?

228
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,152
I don't know.

229
00:17:03,664 --> 00:17:05,256
It sounded like a scream.

230
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,492
Stay here.

231
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:53,970
King.

232
00:18:54,013 --> 00:18:55,537
King, old fellow.

233
00:18:56,382 --> 00:18:57,713
He is dead.

234
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,049
It must have been the lightning.

235
00:19:04,223 --> 00:19:05,713
We'll bury him.

236
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:06,952
As you wish.

237
00:19:07,793 --> 00:19:09,057
Now let us go in
out of the rain, Guy.

238
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:24,505
Why, he was only stunned.

239
00:19:26,246 --> 00:19:27,713
I was going to bury him.

240
00:19:28,348 --> 00:19:29,508
Guy.

241
00:19:30,317 --> 00:19:32,012
I was going to bury him...

242
00:19:32,987 --> 00:19:34,249
alive!

243
00:19:39,227 --> 00:19:42,025
Sketching? Out here?

244
00:19:42,063 --> 00:19:43,587
No, not sketching, really.

245
00:19:43,631 --> 00:19:44,893
Making plans.

246
00:19:44,932 --> 00:19:46,422
For the house?

247
00:19:47,235 --> 00:19:48,964
You're very inquisitive.

248
00:19:49,003 --> 00:19:50,698
Well, I'm married now...

249
00:19:50,738 --> 00:19:52,706
and wives are supposed
to be inquisitive.

250
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,265
And husbands are
Supposed to be secretive.

251
00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:56,243
However, I'll tell you
one of my secrets--

252
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,143
a very closely guarded one.

253
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,638
I possess the ability to kiss
a woman without touching her.

254
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:03,878
Oh, Guy, really.

255
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,320
You don't believe me?
I'll wager you a shilling.

256
00:20:07,356 --> 00:20:08,550
All right.

257
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,285
I'll accept your wager.

258
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:13,385
Come on. Show me this miracle.

259
00:20:13,428 --> 00:20:15,396
With pleasure.

260
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:20,729
There you are.

261
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:23,104
What about your wager?

262
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,107
Oh, I lose the wager.

263
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,342
Here's your shilling.

264
00:20:29,078 --> 00:20:31,069
It was worth much more,
believe me.

265
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:34,844
Guy.

266
00:20:34,884 --> 00:20:36,112
Yes, dear?

267
00:20:38,121 --> 00:20:39,816
What about our honeymoon?

268
00:20:41,124 --> 00:20:42,820
You promised you'd take me
to Venice, remember?

269
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,327
Aren't you happy here?

270
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:45,851
Oh, yes, of course...

271
00:20:45,896 --> 00:20:49,093
but, well, you're
on your own so much...

272
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:51,431
and I worry about you.

273
00:20:51,468 --> 00:20:54,130
You must be patient with me.

274
00:20:55,539 --> 00:20:56,836
All right.

275
00:20:56,874 --> 00:20:57,841
In the meantime...

276
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,070
I'll brighten up
that dreary old house.

277
00:21:01,278 --> 00:21:02,506
There.

278
00:21:05,215 --> 00:21:06,580
Look. Aren't they lovely?

279
00:21:06,617 --> 00:21:07,244
Take them away!

280
00:21:07,285 --> 00:21:10,379
Guy, don't be so ill-tempered.

281
00:21:10,422 --> 00:21:12,185
I can't bear living in
a house without flowers...

282
00:21:12,223 --> 00:21:13,190
and neither should you.

283
00:21:13,224 --> 00:21:14,020
Just throw them away!

284
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:16,084
I loathe flowers.

285
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:17,287
You must promise
never to bring...

286
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:19,695
those sickly funeral
decorations into the house.

287
00:21:19,731 --> 00:21:20,698
Guy, I was only--

288
00:21:20,732 --> 00:21:21,892
You must promise!

289
00:21:23,468 --> 00:21:24,662
All right.

290
00:21:26,838 --> 00:21:27,998
I promise.

291
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,804
Milady?

292
00:21:35,848 --> 00:21:36,815
Yes, Judson.

293
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:38,612
Dr. Archer has arrived, milady.

294
00:21:38,651 --> 00:21:40,118
Oh. Show him in, please.

295
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,832
-This way, sir.
-Thank you, Judson.

296
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,230
Emily.

297
00:21:59,206 --> 00:22:01,606
Miles, dear,
how kind of you to come.

298
00:22:01,641 --> 00:22:03,040
I came directly.
I received your message.

299
00:22:03,076 --> 00:22:04,236
Is something wrong?

300
00:22:04,277 --> 00:22:05,301
Yes.

301
00:22:06,713 --> 00:22:08,578
Guy is ill.

302
00:22:08,615 --> 00:22:09,946
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

303
00:22:09,983 --> 00:22:11,348
I suppose
it's the Italian climate.

304
00:22:11,385 --> 00:22:13,285
But we didn't go to Italy.

305
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,287
But I thought--

306
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:15,288
We've been here in this house...

307
00:22:15,322 --> 00:22:16,119
ever since the day
We were married.

308
00:22:17,058 --> 00:22:18,753
I don't understand.

309
00:22:18,793 --> 00:22:20,226
Neither do I.

310
00:22:21,095 --> 00:22:23,996
All I know is that Guy is ill...

311
00:22:24,031 --> 00:22:26,295
and you've got
to help him, Miles.

312
00:22:26,334 --> 00:22:27,562
My dear, surely your father...

313
00:22:27,602 --> 00:22:29,433
has done everything
that can be done.

314
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,869
My father has done nothing.

315
00:22:30,905 --> 00:22:33,965
To him, Guy is
a perfectly healthy man...

316
00:22:34,008 --> 00:22:35,908
but that isn't true...

317
00:22:35,943 --> 00:22:38,776
and you must do something
to help him, Miles.

318
00:22:38,813 --> 00:22:40,407
If you don't, something
terrible will happen.

319
00:22:40,449 --> 00:22:42,883
He's a completely changed man.

320
00:22:42,918 --> 00:22:44,818
I don't even recognize him.

321
00:22:46,288 --> 00:22:48,483
Well, I'll do whatever I can.

322
00:22:49,758 --> 00:22:51,385
Why don't you take me to him?

323
00:22:52,127 --> 00:22:53,594
Thank you, Miles.

324
00:22:53,629 --> 00:22:55,028
I'll just get my wrap.

325
00:22:55,063 --> 00:22:56,189
Your wrap?

326
00:22:56,231 --> 00:22:58,028
It's chilly on the moors.

327
00:23:03,406 --> 00:23:04,395
Emily...

328
00:23:05,742 --> 00:23:06,970
Where is he?

329
00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:08,733
There.

330
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,175
He started building it
a month ago.

331
00:23:26,564 --> 00:23:27,690
Guy?

332
00:23:30,568 --> 00:23:31,728
Yes?

333
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:33,066
Let me in.

334
00:23:33,604 --> 00:23:35,231
Go away. I'm busy.

335
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,636
Guy, please open the door.

336
00:23:37,675 --> 00:23:40,542
Emily, didn't you
understand me? I said I--

337
00:23:40,578 --> 00:23:42,671
Hello, Guy.

338
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:45,045
Hello, Miles.
I'm glad to see you.

339
00:23:45,683 --> 00:23:48,516
I must apologize.
I was very rude.

340
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,020
Yes, Guy, you were.
Very rude.

341
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:51,989
You see, I've been quite ill.

342
00:23:52,023 --> 00:23:53,650
So I understand.

343
00:23:53,692 --> 00:23:56,252
Guy, I have brought
Miles along...

344
00:23:56,294 --> 00:23:57,852
to see if he can help you.

345
00:23:59,197 --> 00:24:01,859
That's very solicitous,
but quite unnecessary.

346
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,629
I'm helping myself now.

347
00:24:03,668 --> 00:24:04,657
How, Guy?

348
00:24:04,703 --> 00:24:05,795
How?

349
00:24:06,938 --> 00:24:08,838
Come inside. I'll show you.

350
00:24:25,525 --> 00:24:26,617
This is it--

351
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,760
my grand plan.

352
00:24:30,997 --> 00:24:31,964
What shall it be?

353
00:24:31,998 --> 00:24:34,762
Some liqueur, brandy,
amontillado?

354
00:24:37,036 --> 00:24:37,435
Guy, I brought--

355
00:24:48,282 --> 00:24:51,547
Now, let us drink
to something appropriate--

356
00:24:51,585 --> 00:24:52,745
To death.

357
00:24:55,756 --> 00:24:56,814
Not drinking?

358
00:24:56,857 --> 00:24:59,655
What a pity.
It's really quite good.

359
00:24:59,693 --> 00:25:00,921
Guy.

360
00:25:00,961 --> 00:25:02,361
Yes, my dear?

361
00:25:02,397 --> 00:25:04,024
You wish to say something?

362
00:25:04,065 --> 00:25:05,657
No.

363
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,689
Well, in that case...

364
00:25:06,734 --> 00:25:08,531
Iet me tell you
about my latest addition.

365
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,868
I thought of it
the night before last.

366
00:25:10,905 --> 00:25:13,169
Of course, it's highly
unlikely I shall ever use it...

367
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:15,175
but one never knows, does one?

368
00:25:20,081 --> 00:25:21,912
Permits of easy egress...

369
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,113
and it's completely
impassable from the outside.

370
00:25:24,153 --> 00:25:27,020
A simple arrangement,
I grant, but effective.

371
00:25:29,024 --> 00:25:30,548
Guy, this is madness.

372
00:25:30,593 --> 00:25:35,428
Madness? It's the only
Sane answer to my problem.

373
00:25:35,464 --> 00:25:37,898
I'll show you just how mad I am.

374
00:25:40,803 --> 00:25:43,931
I suppose she's told you
my father was a cataleptic?

375
00:25:43,973 --> 00:25:45,497
No, but that doesn't mean that--

376
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:47,408
And I am prone
to the same affliction.

377
00:25:47,444 --> 00:25:48,968
Very well.

378
00:25:49,012 --> 00:25:51,480
Let us consider the following.

379
00:25:51,514 --> 00:25:54,312
Apropos of nothing at all,
I have an attack.

380
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:56,148
Let us say it happens
during dinner.

381
00:25:56,186 --> 00:25:59,053
Emily sends Judson
to fetch a doctor.

382
00:25:59,089 --> 00:26:00,989
The doctor arrives,
he examines me...

383
00:26:01,024 --> 00:26:02,184
and pronounces me dead.

384
00:26:02,225 --> 00:26:03,624
I am, of course, alive.

385
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,628
You know the nature
of catalepsy.

386
00:26:05,662 --> 00:26:09,689
But to the rest
of the world, I am gone--

387
00:26:09,733 --> 00:26:11,793
passed on, deceased.

388
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,565
So a funeral is held...

389
00:26:14,605 --> 00:26:16,539
and I'm brought
down here to this vault...

390
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,633
and placed in this coffin.

391
00:26:26,617 --> 00:26:29,017
The mourners have departed...

392
00:26:29,053 --> 00:26:30,748
the doors are both locked...

393
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:32,085
and I'm alone.

394
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:34,555
Now, pay close attention.

395
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,311
Now, the slightest
movement of my finger...

396
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,146
caused that to happen.

397
00:26:58,184 --> 00:27:00,982
I am now free
of the casket...

398
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,750
but I'm still capable
of only slight effort.

399
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,280
So...

400
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:12,592
"But," you say, "supposing
no one hears the bell?"

401
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:15,465
The departing mourners
lock both the doors.

402
00:27:27,281 --> 00:27:29,511
But is that REALLY foolproof?

403
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,541
What if the gate should stick?

404
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,322
You see?

405
00:27:44,766 --> 00:27:46,427
But, of course,
it's barely possible...

406
00:27:46,468 --> 00:27:48,993
that all these methods
might fail.

407
00:27:49,037 --> 00:27:50,026
So...

408
00:27:54,342 --> 00:27:56,401
But tools break, too,
don't they?

409
00:28:04,252 --> 00:28:07,221
A recent invention by
a Swedish chemist named Nobel.

410
00:28:07,255 --> 00:28:07,813
It's called dynamite.

411
00:28:07,857 --> 00:28:09,154
It's an explosive.

412
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:12,317
But how can one be sure
the stuff will work?

413
00:28:13,262 --> 00:28:14,786
One can't, of course.

414
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:18,459
So...

415
00:28:21,203 --> 00:28:22,966
one has a bit of food...

416
00:28:23,873 --> 00:28:25,204
Something to drink...

417
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:28,707
every five
or ten minutes or so...

418
00:28:28,744 --> 00:28:30,371
rings the bell.

419
00:28:30,412 --> 00:28:31,471
Reads a periodical
or perhaps a book.

420
00:28:31,515 --> 00:28:33,949
In the event the strain
becomes too great...

421
00:28:33,984 --> 00:28:36,976
one can avail oneself with
the soothing effects of music.

422
00:28:38,421 --> 00:28:40,286
And then one simply waits.

423
00:28:40,991 --> 00:28:42,856
Rather well thought out,
don't you think?

424
00:28:44,361 --> 00:28:46,488
But no plan is ever perfect.

425
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,758
So now comes
the "piece de resistance"...

426
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,530
or perhaps one should say
the "coup de grace."

427
00:29:05,983 --> 00:29:07,678
What is it, Guy?

428
00:29:07,718 --> 00:29:08,810
What is it?

429
00:29:09,887 --> 00:29:12,287
The cure for all suffering.

430
00:29:12,323 --> 00:29:14,757
The answer to all problems.

431
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:16,987
The key, my darling,
to heaven...

432
00:29:17,028 --> 00:29:18,859
or to hell...

433
00:29:18,896 --> 00:29:19,727
or to nothingness.

434
00:29:20,966 --> 00:29:22,228
Poison.

435
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,737
Thank you, Judson.

436
00:29:32,744 --> 00:29:34,609
Tea is ready in
the dining room, milady.

437
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:35,635
Thank you.

438
00:29:39,051 --> 00:29:40,712
How do you explain it, Miles?

439
00:29:40,752 --> 00:29:41,583
Well, I don't just yet.

440
00:29:41,621 --> 00:29:42,815
However, I venture to guess...

441
00:29:42,856 --> 00:29:44,847
that the episode
at the cemetery...

442
00:29:44,891 --> 00:29:48,258
changed the general fear
into a specific obsession.

443
00:29:48,294 --> 00:29:49,852
Then...

444
00:29:49,896 --> 00:29:51,523
you don't think it's catalepsy?

445
00:29:51,564 --> 00:29:53,532
He's never had these
attacks before, has he?

446
00:29:53,566 --> 00:29:55,329
I mean, fainting spells,
dizzy spells?

447
00:29:55,368 --> 00:29:57,063
No. No.

448
00:29:57,103 --> 00:29:58,070
But his father--

449
00:29:58,104 --> 00:29:59,230
To the best of our knowledge...

450
00:29:59,272 --> 00:30:01,672
catalepsy is not
an inherited affliction.

451
00:30:03,142 --> 00:30:04,131
And there's a new
line of thought...

452
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:04,940
among some of us--

453
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:07,072
myself, Cargrave,
and a few others--

454
00:30:07,114 --> 00:30:09,548
that may shed some
light on Guy's case.

455
00:30:10,284 --> 00:30:12,149
You see...

456
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:13,483
most people tend
to think of the body...

457
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,488
and the mind as being
totally different--

458
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,013
two separate entities--

459
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:20,185
Whereas, in point of fact...

460
00:30:20,227 --> 00:30:22,195
they're actually linked.

461
00:30:22,229 --> 00:30:23,890
No sugar.

462
00:30:23,931 --> 00:30:25,125
Do you follow me?

463
00:30:26,233 --> 00:30:27,962
Yes, I think so.

464
00:30:28,003 --> 00:30:30,665
You see, physically...

465
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:33,538
Guy may be perfectly sound now.

466
00:30:33,575 --> 00:30:35,475
However, this constant fear...

467
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,478
that gnaws at him
night and day...

468
00:30:37,512 --> 00:30:40,174
may actually bring about
a condition of catalepsy...

469
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:43,378
Where no such
condition exists now.

470
00:30:43,418 --> 00:30:45,147
I see.

471
00:30:45,186 --> 00:30:46,744
Well, what can be done?

472
00:30:48,523 --> 00:30:49,922
I am not sure.

473
00:30:51,092 --> 00:30:51,582
I'm not sure at all.

474
00:30:51,627 --> 00:30:53,026
However, I do know this--

475
00:30:53,062 --> 00:30:55,223
that Guy's mind is like
a keg of gunpowder...

476
00:30:55,264 --> 00:30:57,459
and the smallest thing
might set the fuse--

477
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,990
the most innocent
reminder of death--

478
00:30:59,035 --> 00:31:01,697
corpses, graves,
anything at all.

479
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:03,261
That's the first thing
you must remember.

480
00:31:03,306 --> 00:31:04,898
Do you understand?

481
00:31:04,941 --> 00:31:05,999
Yes.

482
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:08,668
Yes, I understand.

483
00:31:08,711 --> 00:31:12,670
Oh, Miles, I wish you could
come and stay with us.

484
00:31:12,715 --> 00:31:14,410
Well, I was just thinking.

485
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,077
The laboratory downstairs.

486
00:31:15,118 --> 00:31:16,881
What about it?

487
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,047
Well, you may know that Guy
offered me the use of it...

488
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:20,818
in order to further
my researches.

489
00:31:20,857 --> 00:31:23,121
If I accepted his offer...

490
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,594
I might be able to come
here from time to time.

491
00:31:25,629 --> 00:31:28,962
Oh, Miles, that would be
absolutely wonderful!

492
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:29,966
Thank you.

493
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,230
Thank you very much.

494
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:34,430
Well, I must go now,
but I'll be back.

495
00:31:37,174 --> 00:31:39,166
And remember,
the smallest thing.

496
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,472
Don't forget.

497
00:31:40,511 --> 00:31:42,069
I won't forget.

498
00:31:46,084 --> 00:31:47,312
Dear Emily.

499
00:31:57,695 --> 00:31:58,889
Frog, please, Judson.

500
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,295
Yes, sir.

501
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,937
Your frog, sir.

502
00:32:09,975 --> 00:32:11,602
Oh, put him down here, please.

503
00:32:12,444 --> 00:32:15,311
Now, if we place one terminal
of the galvanic battery...

504
00:32:15,347 --> 00:32:17,542
in contact with the nerve...

505
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:21,019
and the other
in contact with muscle...

506
00:32:21,053 --> 00:32:23,112
We cause a contraction
of the muscle.

507
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:27,226
There.

508
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,420
You see?

509
00:32:28,461 --> 00:32:30,554
Now, if you could
control the responses...

510
00:32:30,597 --> 00:32:32,588
of the human mind
as easily as you control...

511
00:32:32,632 --> 00:32:33,599
the muscles of a frog...

512
00:32:33,633 --> 00:32:35,396
I might have some faith
in your work.

513
00:32:35,435 --> 00:32:36,697
Someday, we may be able to...

514
00:32:36,736 --> 00:32:38,795
if we continue our research.

515
00:32:38,838 --> 00:32:40,305
And if you were
to continue YOUR work--

516
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,830
No, no, no, no.

517
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:43,103
You know, I think
you should make an effort...

518
00:32:43,143 --> 00:32:45,407
to take your mind
off your fears.

519
00:32:45,445 --> 00:32:46,503
You should get away
from this place.

520
00:32:46,546 --> 00:32:48,014
Take Emily to Venice.
Then when you return...

521
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,846
most of your problem
Would have disappeared.

522
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,442
Perhaps you're right.
I'll think about it.

523
00:32:51,485 --> 00:32:52,850
Don't think about it. Do it.

524
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,479
I may. Meanwhile...

525
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:56,353
I'll leave you
to your little friends.

526
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,687
Do you wish to continue, sir?

527
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:02,718
Hmm?

528
00:33:02,763 --> 00:33:04,162
Oh, yes, Judson.

529
00:33:09,236 --> 00:33:10,931
You and Miles were right.

530
00:33:10,971 --> 00:33:12,735
I do have to get
outside occasionally.

531
00:33:13,308 --> 00:33:14,639
I told you.

532
00:33:14,676 --> 00:33:16,371
All we need is each other.

533
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,542
We need nothing else
to be happy.

534
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,105
How true.

535
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:22,980
How true that really is.

536
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:28,817
What is it?

537
00:33:30,292 --> 00:33:31,452
Listen!

538
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:35,426
What's the matter, Guy?

539
00:33:35,465 --> 00:33:36,693
That whistling.

540
00:33:40,736 --> 00:33:41,760
I don't hear anything.

541
00:33:41,804 --> 00:33:43,237
Listen, I tell you!

542
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:55,072
Guy!

543
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,086
Guy, don't run away!

544
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,314
Guy!

545
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,111
Guy!

546
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:49,909
Darling! Darling, what's wrong?

547
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:50,012
I saw them.

548
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,181
You saw whom?

549
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:52,713
Those two filthy grave robbers.

550
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,224
They were coming for me.
Ask Emily.

551
00:39:54,259 --> 00:39:56,454
She saw them, too.

552
00:39:56,495 --> 00:39:58,224
No. I saw no one.

553
00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:00,663
But you must have.
They passed right by us.

554
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:02,758
Surely you heard them.

555
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:04,769
Guy, you're overwrought.

556
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:07,294
I--please.

557
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:09,705
They were coming for ME.

558
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,265
No one questions your word, Guy.

559
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:13,106
Don't humor me! I'm not mad!

560
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,169
I saw them as clearly
as I'm seeing you!

561
00:40:14,213 --> 00:40:15,339
Darling, let's go back
to the house...

562
00:40:15,381 --> 00:40:16,848
and you can rest, and--well...

563
00:40:16,883 --> 00:40:18,510
then you can talk.

564
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:19,609
Come on.

565
00:40:25,324 --> 00:40:27,656
You DIDN'T see them?

566
00:40:27,693 --> 00:40:28,660
No.

567
00:40:28,694 --> 00:40:30,685
It was dark and foggy.

568
00:40:39,072 --> 00:40:42,405
I'll join you downstairs
in a little while.

569
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:44,706
I just want to rest some more.

570
00:40:44,745 --> 00:40:46,679
All right, darling.

571
00:40:46,713 --> 00:40:48,476
We'll all be waiting for you.

572
00:41:08,803 --> 00:41:10,327
How is he, Emily?

573
00:41:10,371 --> 00:41:12,339
Well, he's better, I think.

574
00:41:12,907 --> 00:41:15,205
-He's resting.
-Good.

575
00:41:15,243 --> 00:41:17,473
What do you think he saw, Miles?

576
00:41:17,512 --> 00:41:19,605
Exactly what he said--
the two grave robbers.

577
00:41:19,647 --> 00:41:22,411
Well, then why
didn't I see them?

578
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,883
Because they weren't real.

579
00:41:23,852 --> 00:41:25,410
You mean, they were
Something supernatural?

580
00:41:25,454 --> 00:41:28,116
I don't deny the possibility
of the supernatural.

581
00:41:28,157 --> 00:41:29,181
However, I do believe...

582
00:41:29,224 --> 00:41:31,522
that there's a more
logical explanation.

583
00:41:33,095 --> 00:41:35,893
You see, Emily,
the human mind--

584
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:38,957
Well, it's a remarkable
instrument.

585
00:41:39,001 --> 00:41:40,992
It can create something
out of nothing...

586
00:41:41,036 --> 00:41:42,970
and that's probably
What happened.

587
00:41:43,005 --> 00:41:45,473
Well...

588
00:41:45,507 --> 00:41:47,975
What you're trying
to say is that...

589
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,341
Guy is mad.

590
00:41:48,378 --> 00:41:50,744
No. Nothing of the sort.

591
00:41:51,715 --> 00:41:54,809
He's disturbed,
and there's a difference.

592
00:41:54,851 --> 00:41:57,684
If his father
Was prematurely interred--

593
00:41:57,721 --> 00:41:59,120
He wasn't.

594
00:42:00,223 --> 00:42:01,485
How do you know?

595
00:42:01,524 --> 00:42:03,924
I know because
I went to the crypt...

596
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,428
and saw for myself.

597
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:09,330
My father rests in peace.

598
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:04,313
It's the wind.

599
00:44:13,262 --> 00:44:14,695
-Guy!
-He's there!

600
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:20,566
There's nobody there.

601
00:44:20,603 --> 00:44:22,002
But you MUST have seen him!

602
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:24,028
I saw only you, Guy.

603
00:44:35,886 --> 00:44:37,911
Miles, what are we going to do?

604
00:44:37,954 --> 00:44:40,616
Ever since that night
on the moors, he's been--

605
00:44:40,657 --> 00:44:43,558
Well, I just don't
recognize him anymore.

606
00:44:43,593 --> 00:44:45,424
Have you asked him
to go away with you?

607
00:44:45,462 --> 00:44:46,656
How can I?

608
00:44:46,696 --> 00:44:48,664
He won't come out
of that terrible place...

609
00:44:49,566 --> 00:44:50,999
and won't let me in.

610
00:44:53,303 --> 00:44:55,636
All he wants to do
is just sit and brood.

611
00:44:57,508 --> 00:44:59,806
Miles, you've got
to do something.

612
00:44:59,844 --> 00:45:02,278
Emily, I'm afraid
I've done all I can.

613
00:45:04,215 --> 00:45:06,274
Someday, treatment
of the mind...

614
00:45:06,317 --> 00:45:08,217
Will be a science...

615
00:45:08,252 --> 00:45:11,779
and they'll be able to cope
With such problems.

616
00:45:11,823 --> 00:45:13,950
But at this present stage--

617
00:45:13,991 --> 00:45:16,755
Emily, there is one thing
We haven't tried.

618
00:45:18,362 --> 00:45:19,830
Well, just tell me what to do.

619
00:45:24,536 --> 00:45:25,662
Guy?

620
00:45:27,172 --> 00:45:28,696
Guy, let me in.

621
00:45:45,725 --> 00:45:48,421
Well, this is quite a surprise.

622
00:45:48,461 --> 00:45:49,951
Is there any purpose
to this visit--

623
00:45:49,996 --> 00:45:52,794
apart, that is, from
interrupting my work?

624
00:45:52,832 --> 00:45:53,958
Yes.

625
00:45:59,706 --> 00:46:01,833
I thought
you'd given up painting.

626
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:03,843
It's merely portraiture.

627
00:46:03,877 --> 00:46:05,175
Let us say I'm entering
a new period.

628
00:46:05,212 --> 00:46:06,577
May I see it?

629
00:46:06,614 --> 00:46:09,549
I don't think you'd
find it very pleasing.

630
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:12,916
Surely I should be
the one to decide that.

631
00:46:12,953 --> 00:46:15,114
Very well. Don't say
I didn't warn you.

632
00:46:21,729 --> 00:46:26,496
I call it "Some Consummations
Devoutly to be wished."

633
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:27,659
But why?

634
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:28,066
Think.

635
00:46:28,103 --> 00:46:31,038
All these dreadful tortures
you see depicted here--

636
00:46:31,072 --> 00:46:32,972
the rack and the stake...

637
00:46:33,008 --> 00:46:34,771
the whole ghastly catalog--

638
00:46:34,809 --> 00:46:37,243
are they not indeed
devoutly to be wished...

639
00:46:37,279 --> 00:46:41,306
preferred to that fate which
is the most terrible of all?

640
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:44,580
That fate has already
come to pass, Guy.

641
00:46:44,619 --> 00:46:45,711
What are you talking about?

642
00:46:45,754 --> 00:46:47,483
About you.

643
00:46:47,522 --> 00:46:49,217
You don't fear burial alive...

644
00:46:49,257 --> 00:46:51,725
because you are
already buried alive.

645
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,558
What is it you're afraid of?
Being locked in a tomb?

646
00:46:53,596 --> 00:46:56,087
Why, you've been locked
in a tomb for months.

647
00:46:57,566 --> 00:47:00,262
THIS tomb!

648
00:47:00,303 --> 00:47:01,395
And I've been your widow...

649
00:47:01,437 --> 00:47:03,200
and I don't like
being your widow, Guy.

650
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:06,106
And what's more, I'm not
going to be much longer.

651
00:47:07,543 --> 00:47:08,510
Emily!

652
00:47:08,544 --> 00:47:11,604
No, Guy. I'm here
to give you a choice.

653
00:47:11,647 --> 00:47:15,515
You can have this--
this living death--

654
00:47:15,551 --> 00:47:16,143
or you can have me...

655
00:47:16,186 --> 00:47:18,313
but you can't have both.

656
00:47:18,355 --> 00:47:19,322
Emily, please.

657
00:47:19,356 --> 00:47:21,824
I love you, Guy.
I love you very much...

658
00:47:21,858 --> 00:47:23,985
and I want
to take care of you...

659
00:47:24,027 --> 00:47:27,588
but as long
as you're here, I can't.

660
00:47:27,631 --> 00:47:29,929
No one can.

661
00:47:29,967 --> 00:47:31,958
I realize that, but...

662
00:47:33,036 --> 00:47:35,300
I'm so afraid.

663
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:37,967
Oh, you needn't be, my darling.

664
00:47:38,675 --> 00:47:39,370
I promise you.

665
00:47:40,278 --> 00:47:41,768
Look at me.

666
00:47:43,014 --> 00:47:46,575
I promise you that
no matter what happens...

667
00:47:46,617 --> 00:47:50,178
I'll never let them
take you down to that...

668
00:47:50,221 --> 00:47:52,189
that horrible crypt.

669
00:47:53,558 --> 00:47:56,118
Trust me to take care of you.

670
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,288
I do trust you, Emily,
but it isn't that.

671
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:03,290
Guy, if you do choose me...

672
00:48:03,335 --> 00:48:06,634
then you must destroy
this evil vault.

673
00:48:06,672 --> 00:48:08,572
Wipe it off the face
of the earth...

674
00:48:08,607 --> 00:48:10,905
and out of your mind forever!

675
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,343
If you don't...

676
00:48:15,414 --> 00:48:17,109
then I shall never
see you again.

677
00:48:21,186 --> 00:48:23,950
Well, which is it to be?

678
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:26,124
Death by yourself...

679
00:48:27,327 --> 00:48:29,022
or life with me?

680
00:48:59,593 --> 00:49:00,582
Emily!

681
00:49:06,033 --> 00:49:07,933
Please forgive me, darling.

682
00:49:07,968 --> 00:49:09,458
I wouldn't lose you.

683
00:49:09,503 --> 00:49:10,936
I just couldn't.

684
00:49:10,971 --> 00:49:12,666
Not for anything.

685
00:49:12,706 --> 00:49:14,004
Oh, Guy, I love you.

686
00:49:22,818 --> 00:49:25,116
Guy, that took great courage.

687
00:49:25,153 --> 00:49:28,486
No. Once again,
I was motivated by fear--

688
00:49:28,523 --> 00:49:31,390
fear of losing something
more valuable than my life.

689
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:32,916
You'll never regret it.

690
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,322
I pray God you're right.

691
00:49:36,399 --> 00:49:39,061
I want to thank you both
for asking me to the ceremony.

692
00:49:39,902 --> 00:49:42,769
I suppose that now you'll be
having that honeymoon, huh?

693
00:49:42,805 --> 00:49:47,333
Yes, but first there will be
a small party Friday night.

694
00:49:47,376 --> 00:49:49,276
You will be with us,
Miles, won't you?

695
00:49:49,312 --> 00:49:50,939
If your father doesn't
take it into his mind...

696
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,379
to keep me working
at the hospital.

697
00:49:52,415 --> 00:49:55,213
Oh, he won't, because
We shall invite both of you.

698
00:49:55,251 --> 00:49:57,446
Well, then, of course,
in that case.

699
00:51:09,962 --> 00:51:10,395
Lady Catherine?

700
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,999
Milord?

701
00:51:32,887 --> 00:51:34,115
Thank you, Judson.

702
00:51:37,491 --> 00:51:40,460
My friends, to life.

703
00:51:46,767 --> 00:51:48,632
Dr. Gault,
Would you like a cigar?

704
00:51:48,669 --> 00:51:49,829
Oh. Thank you. Yes.

705
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:51,929
-Join us, Miles?
-In just a moment.

706
00:51:55,109 --> 00:51:56,098
It's extraordinary,
Lady Catherine...

707
00:51:56,143 --> 00:51:56,440
but he looks
the picture of health...

708
00:51:56,478 --> 00:51:57,945
don't you agree?

709
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:00,574
Looks can be deceiving,
Dr. Archer.

710
00:52:05,053 --> 00:52:06,247
Thank you.

711
00:52:07,923 --> 00:52:10,892
Well, permit me to offer
my congratulations...

712
00:52:10,926 --> 00:52:12,917
on your lordship's recovery.

713
00:52:12,961 --> 00:52:15,020
I think you should offer them
to Emily and to Miles.

714
00:52:15,063 --> 00:52:16,360
They are responsible.

715
00:52:19,001 --> 00:52:20,060
Well, Father, are you
enjoying yourself?

716
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:21,627
I never enjoy myself.

717
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:23,662
I merely experience
greater and lesser...

718
00:52:23,706 --> 00:52:25,333
degrees of tedium, that's all.

719
00:52:29,879 --> 00:52:31,744
It's just the cat, darling.

720
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:33,180
Yes, I know...

721
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:35,241
but why should
She cry like that?

722
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:36,877
Hungry, I expect.

723
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,887
Where is she?

724
00:52:39,922 --> 00:52:41,446
I don't know.

725
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:42,254
Sounds as if it's coming
from over there.

726
00:52:42,293 --> 00:52:43,453
Poor little thing must be stuck.

727
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:44,688
Wait a moment.

728
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:00,502
Down here.

729
00:53:07,419 --> 00:53:09,216
Look at that.

730
00:53:09,254 --> 00:53:10,312
It's down here.

731
00:53:14,059 --> 00:53:15,651
Down here.

732
00:53:15,694 --> 00:53:18,219
There it is.

733
00:53:18,263 --> 00:53:20,254
All right, old girl.
We'll have you out in a moment.

734
00:53:25,804 --> 00:53:27,704
However could she have
got behind there?

735
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:28,763
It must have crawled through.

736
00:53:28,807 --> 00:53:29,900
Let me have the poor wee thing.

737
00:53:29,942 --> 00:53:31,409
There, now.

738
00:53:31,444 --> 00:53:33,503
What a thing to happen.

739
00:53:41,553 --> 00:53:43,919
There, you see?
No harm done after all.

740
00:53:43,955 --> 00:53:45,547
There. She's all right.

741
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:47,885
Guy, are you all right?

742
00:53:49,994 --> 00:53:51,859
What if we hadn't heard her?

743
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:53,557
But we DID hear her.

744
00:53:53,866 --> 00:53:55,163
You haven't
put these thoughts...

745
00:53:55,201 --> 00:53:57,328
out of your mind
after all, have you?

746
00:53:57,369 --> 00:53:59,599
Oh, of course he has.
This is just a sort of--

747
00:53:59,638 --> 00:54:01,071
You haven't, have you?

748
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:04,703
Guy, you've got to
put it out of your mind.

749
00:54:04,743 --> 00:54:08,042
I've tried.
I've tried everything.

750
00:54:08,881 --> 00:54:10,405
Not everything.

751
00:54:13,652 --> 00:54:16,519
Guy, your fear of catalepsy
is based on your belief...

752
00:54:16,555 --> 00:54:17,455
that your father was
prematurely buried.

753
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:18,889
Isn't that correct?

754
00:54:18,925 --> 00:54:21,519
I heard him. I heard his voice.

755
00:54:21,561 --> 00:54:22,994
You THINKyou heard it.

756
00:54:23,029 --> 00:54:24,792
I heard his voice!

757
00:54:24,831 --> 00:54:26,355
All right, then prove it.

758
00:54:27,867 --> 00:54:29,198
What do you mean?

759
00:54:29,236 --> 00:54:30,362
Just that--prove it.

760
00:54:30,403 --> 00:54:32,394
Take me down to the crypt
and show me his body.

761
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,807
I can't.

762
00:54:34,841 --> 00:54:36,206
Because you know it isn't true.

763
00:54:36,243 --> 00:54:37,608
-No!
-Yes.

764
00:54:37,644 --> 00:54:39,544
Why else do you think
you've avoided it?

765
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:40,171
Because you're afraid--
afraid that this fear...

766
00:54:40,214 --> 00:54:42,375
is nothing more
than a trick of your mind.

767
00:54:42,416 --> 00:54:44,884
I'd give anything
to find out if that were true.

768
00:54:44,919 --> 00:54:46,887
All right, then
take me downstairs.

769
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,527
All right.

770
00:54:55,663 --> 00:54:56,652
I will.

771
00:54:56,697 --> 00:54:58,688
No. Guy, don't you
think you should rest?

772
00:54:58,733 --> 00:55:00,496
Emily, Miles is right.

773
00:55:00,534 --> 00:55:02,525
I've put this off long enough.

774
00:55:42,145 --> 00:55:44,670
The key to the crypt--
it's gone.

775
00:55:44,714 --> 00:55:46,807
Who has access to these?

776
00:55:46,849 --> 00:55:48,180
No one but myself.

777
00:55:48,217 --> 00:55:49,844
But do you keep it locked?

778
00:55:49,886 --> 00:55:50,046
No, but...

779
00:55:50,688 --> 00:55:53,384
Guy, did you come
down here and take the key?

780
00:55:53,424 --> 00:55:54,891
I don't think so.

781
00:55:55,893 --> 00:55:56,917
Is it possible
for someone to do...

782
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,053
a thing like that
and not remember it?

783
00:55:59,096 --> 00:56:00,358
It's possible.
You admit to doing...

784
00:56:00,397 --> 00:56:03,628
many things lately
that you don't remember.

785
00:56:03,667 --> 00:56:06,431
Well, it's unimportant.
We'll break it open.

786
00:56:18,483 --> 00:56:19,677
Follow me.

787
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,652
Which one is it?

788
00:56:31,396 --> 00:56:33,057
Over there.

789
00:56:42,908 --> 00:56:44,375
I can't.

790
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:46,674
You must.
It's your only chance.

791
00:56:46,712 --> 00:56:49,374
If you fail now,
you'll be haunted forever.

792
00:57:30,057 --> 00:57:31,786
Kate, bring me a mirror.

793
00:57:40,268 --> 00:57:43,066
You're wasting your time.
He's dead.

794
00:57:43,104 --> 00:57:46,005
No. No, he can't be.

795
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,530
He can't be.

796
00:58:05,694 --> 00:58:08,720
He's finished. Heart attack.

797
00:58:08,764 --> 00:58:09,992
Oh, no!

798
00:58:10,032 --> 00:58:10,522
Are you sure, Dr. Gault?

799
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:11,693
Of course I am.

800
00:58:11,734 --> 00:58:14,032
No, there's no sign of life,
but to be absolutely sure...

801
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:15,298
We should make one more test.

802
00:58:15,338 --> 00:58:17,670
Foolishness, Archer.
The man's dead.

803
00:58:17,707 --> 00:58:20,005
Judson, help me with
the galvanic battery.

804
00:58:20,043 --> 00:58:22,011
No, don't do this.

805
00:58:22,045 --> 00:58:25,037
Listen to me. I'm alive.
Can't you hear me?

806
00:58:25,081 --> 00:58:27,572
I'm alive! I'm alive!

807
00:58:32,956 --> 00:58:35,392
Uh, Kate, you and Emily
had better leave the room.

808
00:58:39,063 --> 00:58:40,758
Miles.

809
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:43,790
Miles! In the name of heaven!

810
00:59:14,666 --> 00:59:17,692
Well? Is he dead or isn't he?

811
00:59:19,137 --> 00:59:20,604
He is.

812
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:21,971
No. I'm not dead.

813
00:59:22,008 --> 00:59:23,999
I'm alive!

814
00:59:28,247 --> 00:59:30,340
Judson, help me
With the battery.

815
00:59:31,918 --> 00:59:34,887
We may as well take him
back to the crypt.

816
00:59:34,921 --> 00:59:39,654
No. I promised him that
no matter what happens...

817
00:59:39,692 --> 00:59:42,593
I'd never let them take him
down to the crypt.

818
00:59:42,628 --> 00:59:44,357
Nonsense, Emily.

819
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:48,427
Oh, well. It's your decision.

820
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,006
Man that is born of woman...

821
00:59:56,043 --> 00:59:59,945
hath but a short time to live,
and is full of misery.

822
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:03,245
He cometh up and is
cut down like a flower.

823
01:00:03,283 --> 01:00:05,547
He fleeth as it were a shadow...

824
01:00:05,586 --> 01:00:07,350
and never continueth
in one stay.

825
01:00:07,388 --> 01:00:10,949
In the midst of life,
We are in death.

826
01:00:10,992 --> 01:00:15,019
Of whom may we seek for succor
but of thee, dear Lord...

827
01:00:15,063 --> 01:00:17,964
Who, for our sins,
art justly displeased?

828
01:00:17,999 --> 01:00:20,490
Yet, O Lord God most mighty...

829
01:00:20,535 --> 01:00:23,129
O holy and most
merciful savior...

830
01:00:23,171 --> 01:00:26,800
deliver us not into the bitter
pain of eternal death.

831
01:00:26,841 --> 01:00:30,333
Thou knowest, Lord,
the secrets of our hearts.

832
01:00:30,378 --> 01:00:32,211
Shut not thy merciful ears
to thy prayers...

833
01:00:32,247 --> 01:00:34,875
but spare us, God most mighty.

834
01:00:34,917 --> 01:00:39,183
O most merciful savior, thou
most worthy judge eternal...

835
01:00:39,221 --> 01:00:41,519
suffer us not
at our last hour...

836
01:00:41,557 --> 01:00:45,186
for any pains of death
to fall from thee.

837
01:00:45,227 --> 01:00:47,058
Suffer us not.

838
01:00:49,531 --> 01:00:51,396
Pains of death.

839
01:00:51,433 --> 01:00:54,129
Oh, please, help me!

840
01:00:54,169 --> 01:00:54,761
Someone, help me.

841
01:00:54,804 --> 01:00:55,896
Help me!

842
01:00:55,939 --> 01:00:57,907
Amen.

843
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:02,269
You may say farewell now.

844
01:01:12,055 --> 01:01:14,250
Good-bye, my darling.

845
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:15,917
Emily.

846
01:01:15,959 --> 01:01:18,359
Emily, come back.

847
01:01:18,395 --> 01:01:19,192
Come back!

848
01:01:43,588 --> 01:01:45,419
They'll see me.

849
01:01:45,457 --> 01:01:47,118
They'll look at my eyes.

850
01:01:47,159 --> 01:01:49,753
They're not taking me
to the crypt.

851
01:01:49,795 --> 01:01:52,730
But... Where ARE
they taking me?

852
01:01:52,764 --> 01:01:55,255
Where? where?

853
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,961
Why can't I move?

854
01:01:57,002 --> 01:02:00,403
Oh, God, why can't I move?

855
01:02:22,395 --> 01:02:24,363
O merciful God...

856
01:02:24,397 --> 01:02:26,797
We consign the soul
of Guy Carrell...

857
01:02:26,833 --> 01:02:28,495
son of Gideon
and Agatha Carrell...

858
01:02:28,535 --> 01:02:30,332
to thine eternal care.

859
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:31,394
Amen.

860
01:02:51,091 --> 01:02:51,285
Look at me!

861
01:02:51,326 --> 01:02:52,520
Someone, look at me!

862
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:56,826
Oh, for God's sake, please!
You can't bury me alive!

863
01:02:56,865 --> 01:02:58,856
Can't you see I'm alive?

864
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,700
God, why can't I move?
Why can't I move?

865
01:03:05,874 --> 01:03:08,365
No. No!

866
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:09,706
Help me.

867
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:12,076
Someone, help me!

868
01:03:12,113 --> 01:03:14,809
I'm alive!
Can't you hear me?

869
01:03:14,849 --> 01:03:15,817
Can't you see my eyes?

870
01:03:27,129 --> 01:03:29,996
I'm alive! Alive! Ali--

871
01:03:33,869 --> 01:03:36,099
You'll be leaving, I suppose...

872
01:03:36,138 --> 01:03:38,504
after the reading of the will.

873
01:03:38,541 --> 01:03:39,202
Why should you say that?

874
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:44,040
No reason. I merely thought
that under the circumstances...

875
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,776
you might find this
house rather disturbing.

876
01:03:46,817 --> 01:03:48,910
To your conscience, I mean.

877
01:03:48,952 --> 01:03:50,078
Kate, are you implying...

878
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:52,315
that Emily is in any way
responsible for Guy's death?

879
01:03:52,355 --> 01:03:53,447
No one is responsible.

880
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:55,458
He died of a heart attack
induced by shock.

881
01:03:55,492 --> 01:03:56,516
Don't you understand?

882
01:03:56,560 --> 01:04:00,018
Yes. I understand.

883
01:04:00,063 --> 01:04:02,258
The fact is, he brought on
the shock himself.

884
01:04:02,299 --> 01:04:03,267
The episode in the crypt
and all the others--

885
01:04:03,301 --> 01:04:04,393
they were planned, contrived.

886
01:04:04,435 --> 01:04:05,402
Don't you see?

887
01:04:05,436 --> 01:04:07,233
Planned? By whom?

888
01:04:07,271 --> 01:04:09,205
By Guy himself.

889
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:12,698
In a strange way,
he wanted to die.

890
01:04:12,743 --> 01:04:14,608
Stop talking about him!

891
01:04:39,571 --> 01:04:42,472
That's a bit much,
Mr. Sweeney.

892
01:04:42,507 --> 01:04:44,031
What is, Mr. Mole?

893
01:04:44,076 --> 01:04:46,738
The old gentleman sending us
out here to dig up this one.

894
01:04:46,778 --> 01:04:48,473
I mean, his own son-in-law!

895
01:04:48,513 --> 01:04:50,482
Well, one stiff's pretty
much like another.

896
01:04:50,516 --> 01:04:53,485
Oh, we've struck wood.
Now, where's the bloody crowbar?

897
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:55,680
I believe I left it up on top.

898
01:04:55,722 --> 01:04:59,055
Well, Mr. Mole, would you do me
the kindness to fetch it down?

899
01:04:59,092 --> 01:05:00,821
Yes, I will, Mr. Sweeney.

900
01:05:35,062 --> 01:05:37,054
I found it, Mr. Sweeney!

901
01:05:37,098 --> 01:05:38,656
Huh? No!

902
01:05:40,702 --> 01:05:42,897
No! I never did
nothing to you!

903
01:05:42,938 --> 01:05:44,565
Please! Please!

904
01:05:44,606 --> 01:05:47,268
I've never done nothing
to you. Please!

905
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:19,399
Sweeney! You blithering
idiot! what did you--

906
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:22,309
I told you to take him
to my quarters.

907
01:06:22,345 --> 01:06:24,405
Oh, well. May as well
have a look at him now.

908
01:06:24,448 --> 01:06:25,745
Yes.

909
01:06:29,019 --> 01:06:30,452
Ironic, don't you think?

910
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:33,718
And rather fitting, really.

911
01:06:33,757 --> 01:06:38,285
In life, Guy Carrell contributed
nothing to medical science.

912
01:06:38,996 --> 01:06:42,397
In death, he shall
Serve it admirably.

913
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:45,901
Sweeney?

914
01:06:49,674 --> 01:06:52,142
No! You're dead! No!

915
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:37,551
Emily, there's nothing
Whatever wrong with you.

916
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:41,424
Well, not physically, perhaps.

917
01:07:42,328 --> 01:07:45,695
Then why did you send
Judson for me? Hmm?

918
01:07:45,732 --> 01:07:50,795
Well, I was afraid to be alone.

919
01:07:50,837 --> 01:07:52,998
Well, I can understand that.

920
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:56,171
Perhaps you shouldn't be here.

921
01:07:56,209 --> 01:07:58,542
Oh, Miles, don't you see that...

922
01:08:02,483 --> 01:08:04,542
Please come and sit down.

923
01:08:05,719 --> 01:08:07,050
Please?

924
01:08:15,196 --> 01:08:17,994
Now, just for a moment,
and then you must go to sleep.

925
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,492
Miles, you must know...

926
01:08:22,537 --> 01:08:25,995
or at least
you must sense that...

927
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:28,009
I've been very worried today...

928
01:08:28,043 --> 01:08:33,071
that I'm in need of something
or someone to give me solace.

929
01:08:35,884 --> 01:08:38,580
You and I were
very close once, Miles.

930
01:08:39,921 --> 01:08:41,855
You remember that, don't you?

931
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:44,053
I can remember
a medical student...

932
01:08:44,093 --> 01:08:46,653
Who was poor
as a church mouse...

933
01:08:46,696 --> 01:08:49,426
and a girl who wanted
to be a great lady.

934
01:08:51,501 --> 01:08:53,799
I was very foolish.

935
01:08:56,472 --> 01:08:57,996
Oh, Miles...

936
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:01,840
maybe it's not too late for us.

937
01:09:01,878 --> 01:09:03,846
But, Emily...

938
01:09:06,717 --> 01:09:08,309
I made a mistake.

939
01:09:12,222 --> 01:09:14,315
Is that so very wrong?

940
01:09:18,295 --> 01:09:19,785
Come in!

941
01:09:20,964 --> 01:09:21,931
Dr. Archer.

942
01:09:21,965 --> 01:09:23,262
What is it, Judson?

943
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:25,234
It's--excuse me, milady.

944
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:27,169
It's something I'd
like you to see, sir...

945
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:28,171
if you would.

946
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:29,433
-A medical matter?
-Yes.

947
01:09:29,473 --> 01:09:30,498
Then certainly Dr. Gault
could take care of it.

948
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:32,134
I think Dr. Gault
Would want you to come...

949
01:09:32,177 --> 01:09:34,202
as quickly as possible, sir.

950
01:09:34,245 --> 01:09:36,736
Perhaps you had
better go, Miles.

951
01:09:37,849 --> 01:09:39,749
Now, come along, Judson.

952
01:09:46,424 --> 01:09:48,551
Judson, why are you
behaving so oddly?

953
01:09:48,593 --> 01:09:51,027
I heard a sound from
the laboratory, sir...

954
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:52,586
just a bit ago, and...

955
01:09:53,364 --> 01:09:54,127
Yes?

956
01:09:54,166 --> 01:09:56,430
See for yourself, sir.

957
01:10:03,776 --> 01:10:05,175
Who's that?

958
01:10:05,945 --> 01:10:07,537
Miles?

959
01:10:12,585 --> 01:10:14,314
No welcome?

960
01:10:15,487 --> 01:10:16,478
No rejoicing?

961
01:10:17,057 --> 01:10:18,854
No kiss?

962
01:10:31,471 --> 01:10:33,905
He's been killed
by electrical force.

963
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:35,430
Dr. Archer!

964
01:10:38,945 --> 01:10:40,572
That's Sweeney.

965
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:53,488
Emily.

966
01:10:57,331 --> 01:10:58,821
Emily?

967
01:12:07,771 --> 01:12:09,432
Guy.

968
01:12:14,212 --> 01:12:15,406
Now...

969
01:12:15,447 --> 01:12:17,472
Guy, you've got to listen to me.

970
01:12:17,515 --> 01:12:21,042
To what? More lies? More deceit?

971
01:12:21,086 --> 01:12:22,383
More treachery?

972
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:24,115
No, no. That's not true.

973
01:12:24,155 --> 01:12:25,782
Oh, but it is.

974
01:12:25,824 --> 01:12:28,190
You were very clever, Emily.

975
01:12:28,226 --> 01:12:30,353
VERY clever.

976
01:12:30,395 --> 01:12:33,660
In a way, I'm sorry
to spoil your plans.

977
01:12:33,698 --> 01:12:35,529
Oh, I had no plans.

978
01:12:35,567 --> 01:12:37,125
It was Kate.

979
01:12:37,902 --> 01:12:39,666
You--you wouldn't kill me,
Would you, Guy?

980
01:12:39,705 --> 01:12:42,902
No, darling, not at all...

981
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:45,001
just as you didn't kill ME.

982
01:12:45,044 --> 01:12:48,810
You wouldn't soil
your pretty hands with murder.

983
01:12:48,848 --> 01:12:52,784
No, you just stood aside
and let them bury me alive!

984
01:12:52,818 --> 01:12:54,683
No, Guy! No!

985
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:58,417
And so...I shall not kill YOU.

986
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:01,757
That sorry task I shall
leave to the earth...

987
01:13:01,795 --> 01:13:03,319
and the darkness...

988
01:13:03,363 --> 01:13:06,890
and the terrified pounding
of your own heart.

989
01:13:21,715 --> 01:13:23,376
Guy, no! Not that!

990
01:13:23,417 --> 01:13:25,113
Yes, my beautiful,
my perfidious...

991
01:13:25,153 --> 01:13:27,917
my treacherous love...THAT.

992
01:13:41,068 --> 01:13:43,195
No, Guy!

993
01:13:55,717 --> 01:13:56,843
Guy!

994
01:14:00,456 --> 01:14:03,050
Stay precisely
Where you are, Miles.

995
01:14:03,091 --> 01:14:04,956
I've no desire to harm you.

996
01:14:05,727 --> 01:14:07,354
What have you done, Guy?

997
01:14:07,396 --> 01:14:09,887
Paid a debt of long standing.

998
01:14:09,932 --> 01:14:10,490
No!

999
01:14:10,533 --> 01:14:12,501
This has nothing to do with you.

1000
01:14:12,535 --> 01:14:14,662
I found that out
earlier this evening.

1001
01:14:14,704 --> 01:14:16,171
In heaven's name, Guy!

1002
01:14:16,206 --> 01:14:18,697
Yes...in heaven's name.

1003
01:14:18,741 --> 01:14:20,436
Give me that shovel!

1004
01:15:52,139 --> 01:15:53,629
She's dead!

1005
01:15:55,275 --> 01:15:57,004
Thank God.

1006
01:15:57,044 --> 01:15:58,636
Kate, what are you saying?

1007
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:02,281
Are you so blind?

1008
01:16:04,284 --> 01:16:05,842
Can't you see?

1009
01:16:09,557 --> 01:16:11,616
That's the key to the crypt.

1010
01:16:11,659 --> 01:16:14,560
She had no time to replace it.

1011
01:16:17,065 --> 01:16:19,033
I can't believe it. Not Emily.

1012
01:16:19,067 --> 01:16:21,661
Yes. Emily.

1013
01:16:21,703 --> 01:16:26,697
Sweet, beautiful, gentle Emily.

1014
01:16:26,741 --> 01:16:29,608
Once you told her
how easy it would be...

1015
01:16:29,644 --> 01:16:32,740
to use Guy's fear to kill him,
she went to work.

1016
01:16:37,987 --> 01:16:41,479
First, the hiring
of the grave robbers...

1017
01:16:41,523 --> 01:16:43,787
to torment him...

1018
01:16:43,826 --> 01:16:46,317
the cat in the wall...

1019
01:16:46,362 --> 01:16:50,230
and finally the desecration
of our father's tomb.

1020
01:16:52,568 --> 01:16:54,002
Oh, Guy!

1021
01:16:54,537 --> 01:16:56,664
I knew what she was doing...

1022
01:16:56,706 --> 01:16:59,140
and I wanted to tell you...

1023
01:16:59,175 --> 01:17:01,973
but you wouldn't
have believed me.

1024
01:17:02,012 --> 01:17:04,503
I had to wait for proof.

1025
01:17:04,547 --> 01:17:07,710
You can see that, can't you?

1026
01:17:09,319 --> 01:17:11,685
But I waited too long.

1027
01:17:13,056 --> 01:17:15,718
I was too late.

1028
01:17:18,128 --> 01:17:19,323
Too late.

1029
01:17:47,284 --> 01:17:50,284
