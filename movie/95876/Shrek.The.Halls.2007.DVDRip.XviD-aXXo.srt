1
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,891
There. That's better.

2
00:00:41,376 --> 00:00:42,554
All clean.

3
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:52,477
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're awake

4
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:53,852
What are you doing here?

5
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:57,432
-And what are you talking about?
-I'm talkin' about Santa Claus!

6
00:00:57,502 --> 00:01:00,733
Only 159 days left till
Christmas, so you better be good.

7
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,475
I'd better be good? How 'bout this? You
better be scarce. Now go on.

8
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:06,298
I don't care about Christmas.

9
00:01:11,743 --> 00:01:14,229
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way

10
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:16,211
-Donkey!
-51 days left till Christmas.

11
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:18,653
Get your butt in gear
and get your marshmallows,

12
00:01:18,718 --> 00:01:21,816
because without marshmallows,
sweet potatoes are nothin'!

13
00:01:21,885 --> 00:01:26,010
Enough! I don't care
about any of this nonsense.

14
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:27,125
Now shoo!

15
00:01:27,198 --> 00:01:29,336
OK. But don't say
I didn't say I told you so.

16
00:01:34,526 --> 00:01:37,241
Smashing through the snow
And laughin' all the way

17
00:01:37,308 --> 00:01:40,821
It's finally here. Tomorrow's Christmas
Eve! Got everything ready?

18
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,715
-No.
-You haven't trimmed stockings

19
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,951
or hung your chestnuts
or roasted the tree?

20
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,908
-Or figgified your puddin'?
-Donkey!

21
00:01:46,972 --> 00:01:48,695
Will you get it through your head?

22
00:01:48,764 --> 00:01:52,025
No one here gives
a hoot about Christmas!

23
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:54,907
A white Christmas!
How perfect.

24
00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:58,452
And it's our first one together
as a family. Isn't this exciting?

25
00:01:58,524 --> 00:02:01,012
Oh, yeah!
How 'bout that?

26
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,993
There's somethin' Shrek needs to...

27
00:02:03,068 --> 00:02:05,272
Don't ruin the surprise
for her, Donkey.

28
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,155
Surprise?
Oh, I love surprises!

29
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:11,350
You're the best. Come on,
let's go make some cookies.

30
00:02:12,795 --> 00:02:15,031
OK, you a dead man.
You know that?

31
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,007
Hold that thought.
I'll be right back.

32
00:02:38,456 --> 00:02:40,367
OH, good, you're still open.

33
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:43,255
No, we're closing now.
Merry Christmas.

34
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:46,420
Wait, wait, wait! I need your help.
I have to make a Christmas,

35
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:49,009
and I have no idea
what it is or how to do it!

36
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,088
Why didn't you say so?
That's super.

37
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:53,715
I know all about Christmas,
and I've just the book.

38
00:02:53,785 --> 00:02:56,784
Christmas for Village Idiots.
It's all spelled out. See?

39
00:02:56,856 --> 00:02:59,344
One, decorate house.
Two, the stockings by the fireplace.

40
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:01,784
Step three, the Christmas feast.

41
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,182
-What's that?
-Step four? The Christmas tree!

42
00:03:04,248 --> 00:03:06,036
The tree goes inside the house?

43
00:03:07,447 --> 00:03:10,383
Anyway, step five, the telling
of the Christmas story.

44
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:13,522
This is the step that says
I created the perfect Christmas

45
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:16,275
for my perfect family perfectly.
Family by the fire,

46
00:03:16,344 --> 00:03:18,765
everyone cozy and warm.
Happy, happy. Voila!

47
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:20,562
-Sure.
-Long story short,

48
00:03:20,631 --> 00:03:22,542
it's all right here.
It's no problem.

49
00:03:22,615 --> 00:03:24,503
-Perfect.
-I mean, how hard can it be?

50
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:28,276
-I didn't get the eggnog!
-Closed?! What do you mean?

51
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:30,546
-Dwight the Knight action figure?
-Marshmallows!

52
00:03:30,614 --> 00:03:33,232
Sweet potatoes are nothing
without marshmallows!

53
00:03:33,302 --> 00:03:35,277
Bye-bye. Have a super Christmas.

54
00:03:42,741 --> 00:03:45,108
Honey, is that you?

55
00:03:46,038 --> 00:03:49,354
Fiona! What are
you doing up so early?

56
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:52,977
-Are you OK?
-I'm all right.

57
00:03:53,044 --> 00:03:57,202
What are you? Are you decorating?

58
00:03:57,844 --> 00:04:00,813
-Yeah, that. Surprised?
-Yes.

59
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:04,082
Well, this is our first
Christmas together as a family,

60
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:07,279
and, you know, I just want to
make sure that it's perfect.

61
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:10,415
Shrek, I think... it's beautiful.

62
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:12,306
-It's passable.
-It's horrible!

63
00:04:12,372 --> 00:04:14,641
-Donkey!
-They usually toilet paper and run.

64
00:04:14,707 --> 00:04:17,359
Whoever did this means business!
Get rid of all this

65
00:04:17,428 --> 00:04:19,369
and get tinsel and doilies and ribbons

66
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:20,939
and some plastic reindeer.

67
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:22,922
What is it you wanted today?

68
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:25,995
It's Christmas Eve!
I've brought you a little somethin'.

69
00:04:26,068 --> 00:04:28,882
Go ahead, take a couple.
I bought plenty for everybody!

70
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:31,533
Oh, isn't that... nice.

71
00:04:31,603 --> 00:04:35,858
Well, thanks for stopping by for that
brief visit, but as you can see,

72
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:37,613
there's a lot of work to do.

73
00:04:37,683 --> 00:04:39,625
Just like him to wait till last minute.

74
00:04:39,698 --> 00:04:42,382
Don't worry, there's one thing I
know, it's Christmas.

75
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,298
He's gonna want help,
advice, and he's definitely...

76
00:04:45,363 --> 00:04:50,153
Actually, I think what he really wants
is a nice family Christmas.

77
00:04:50,226 --> 00:04:53,521
Oh, a family Christmas.

78
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:55,560
Yeah. It's the
first one with the kids.

79
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:57,967
Don't say a word.
I know exactly what you mean.

80
00:04:58,033 --> 00:05:00,400
I got a lot to do now,
so I better get movin'.

81
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,767
Thank you, Donkey!
And Merry Christmas!

82
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,328
All right. Merry Christmas!

83
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:07,980
Love and joy come to you
and to me some waffles too

84
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:12,170
Donkey's right. It's Christmas Eve.

85
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:14,761
How am I ever gonna
get this done in time?

86
00:05:14,832 --> 00:05:17,101
This is gonna be
the best Christmas ever.

87
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:19,437
And we're going to do it together,
so come on.

88
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:45,635
Everything looks so good!

89
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:47,238
Nice job, honey.

90
00:05:47,311 --> 00:05:49,546
Well, we all did it together.

91
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:53,193
Now what would the perfect Christmas
be without a Christmas story?

92
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:58,666
'Twas the night before Christmas
and all through the house

93
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:01,995
Not a creature was stirring...
What?

94
00:06:02,063 --> 00:06:04,583
-Merry Christmas, Shrek!
-Oh, not you!

95
00:06:04,654 --> 00:06:06,694
We're here to smother you
with Christmas love!

96
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,351
Absolutely not!
Bad Donkey! Go home!

97
00:06:09,422 --> 00:06:11,691
How are you gonna have
Christmas without family?

98
00:06:11,758 --> 00:06:13,613
-Seasons greeting!
-Happy Holidays!

99
00:06:13,678 --> 00:06:15,533
-Merry Christmas!
-A nice surprise!

100
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:16,972
Oh, yeah.

101
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:23,364
OK, I will assume the position.

102
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:30,633
-I am the joy-filled swine!
-Yay, for the season of love!

103
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:33,962
This is for stockings.
You can't be hanging laundry up!

104
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:36,067
Donkey! Don't touch anything.

105
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,627
How we gonna roast chestnuts
on this little bitty fire?

106
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:40,739
Hey, baby, you mind?

107
00:06:44,844 --> 00:06:47,429
-Oh, boy!
-This way, gents.

108
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,320
That was our supper!

109
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:52,039
Hey!

110
00:06:54,092 --> 00:06:57,125
Did you hurt yourself
when you fell out of heaven?

111
00:06:57,195 --> 00:06:59,530
-Where are we going to put it?
-I don't know.

112
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:02,595
Let's put it over here.
No, that is not with the feng shui.

113
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,456
Come on, everybody, let's dance!

114
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:20,039
-Occupied!
-It's me. Shrek?

115
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:23,816
-Yes?
-Come back to the party. Please?

116
00:07:23,881 --> 00:07:25,889
I don't think
that'd be such a good idea.

117
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:29,475
Come on. It's not that bad.

118
00:07:29,546 --> 00:07:32,295
OK, I know you're
not a party person, but...

119
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:35,622
But what? This is not the
kind of Christmas I had in mind.

120
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:38,984
They're our friends, Shrek.
They all mean well.

121
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:41,918
-How many babies did Fiona have?
-She has babies?

122
00:07:41,993 --> 00:07:44,327
-I don't know.
-I better get back to the house.

123
00:07:44,392 --> 00:07:46,335
Surprised we have
a house to go back to.

124
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:49,725
-Are you coming?
-I can hardly wait.

125
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,556
Finally!

126
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,738
Look at him go!

127
00:08:00,808 --> 00:08:02,629
Excuse me! Excuse me!

128
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:04,353
Excuse you for what?

129
00:08:04,424 --> 00:08:07,292
I don't feel very good.

130
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:11,589
-I feel better now.
-A chocolate chip!

131
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:12,736
Sweetheart?

132
00:08:17,448 --> 00:08:18,854
Mind if I cut in?

133
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:22,531
Don't stop believing

134
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,691
Up and down the boulevard

135
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,553
I am a little Christmas angel!

136
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:33,508
Hey there, my sweeties.

137
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:39,066
Would you like Daddy
to finish the story for you?

138
00:08:39,142 --> 00:08:40,351
Yeah?

139
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:43,104
The children were nestled
all snug in their beds,

140
00:08:43,173 --> 00:08:46,435
-while visions of sugarplums...
-Were you tellin' 'em

141
00:08:46,502 --> 00:08:49,348
The Night Before Christmas?
That's the best Christmas story ever!

142
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:51,323
-I'm the best teller ever!
-Donkey...

143
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:52,890
I got it committed
to memorization!

144
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,852
-Gather round!
-Donkey! Wait!

145
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,251
I'm supposed to tell
the Christmas story.

146
00:08:57,317 --> 00:09:00,185
'Twas the night before Christmas
and I spent all the day

147
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:03,010
Finishin' up on my Christmas display

148
00:09:03,077 --> 00:09:05,565
Now, missin' all this
would be nothin' but tragic

149
00:09:05,637 --> 00:09:08,287
So just follow me
and I'll show you the magic

150
00:09:08,356 --> 00:09:10,429
Now, out in the yard
in a glorious clutter

151
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:13,216
Is a spectacle there that'll
make your heart flutter

152
00:09:13,284 --> 00:09:15,772
With 20-foot cheese balls
and a big eggnog fountain

153
00:09:15,844 --> 00:09:18,746
And yodelin' elves
on an ambrosia mountain

154
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,241
A stage where acrobats
jump, leap and prance

155
00:09:21,316 --> 00:09:24,282
And honor the day
through interpretive dance

156
00:09:25,122 --> 00:09:27,392
But just when you think
the display is complete

157
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:29,946
The Christmas parade
comes right down the street

158
00:09:30,018 --> 00:09:32,352
With holiday floats
all in silver and blue

159
00:09:32,418 --> 00:09:35,321
With sugarplum fairies
and a reindeer or two

160
00:09:35,394 --> 00:09:38,012
There's a baton-twirlin'
snowman all happy and perky

161
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,864
Magical peacocks
and a dancin' roast turkey

162
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:47,421
And right when you think
that you've just seen it all

163
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:51,168
Comes a huge waffle Santa
that's 50 feet tall

164
00:09:51,235 --> 00:09:53,624
Ho, ho, ho!

165
00:09:53,698 --> 00:09:56,415
With syrup and butter
the sight just amazes

166
00:09:56,482 --> 00:09:59,165
As it's flanked by a choir
all singin' his praises

167
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:09,464
-Donkey.
-Santa?

168
00:10:09,536 --> 00:10:10,746
-Donkey!
-Santa!

169
00:10:10,817 --> 00:10:12,671
Donkey!

170
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:15,803
Very inappropriate, amigo.
Please, allow me.

171
00:10:15,872 --> 00:10:18,239
-Oh, Puss, not you too.
-In my homeland,

172
00:10:18,305 --> 00:10:21,151
we tell a very different tale
of the Santa Nicholas.

173
00:10:21,216 --> 00:10:23,452
He's not made of waffles.

174
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,585
This Santa was suave
He was nothing like that

175
00:10:26,655 --> 00:10:30,714
The Santa I know
was a hot Latin cat

176
00:10:30,784 --> 00:10:34,614
He was dressed all in fur
from his head to his paws

177
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:39,990
And he stood there heroic
A real Santa... Claws

178
00:10:40,063 --> 00:10:42,518
Red are his boots

179
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:45,307
-And so is his cape
-Olé!

180
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:49,204
His sword is a cane
that tastes like crab cake

181
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:51,700
He wears a fine belt
and a leather cravat

182
00:10:51,774 --> 00:10:56,084
And there's a cute fuzzy thing
which hangs down from his hat

183
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:08,821
I have shamed myself.

184
00:11:08,893 --> 00:11:11,031
-Olé!
-All right, everybody,

185
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:13,851
if you leave now,
you can beat the holiday traffic.

186
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:16,764
Phooey with all your
sunshine and lollipops!

187
00:11:16,828 --> 00:11:20,124
Where I come from,
Christmas is a nightmare.

188
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:25,657
'Twas the night before Christmas
and the prettiest sights

189
00:11:25,724 --> 00:11:29,686
Were my sweetheart beside me
in the bright Christmas lights

190
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:31,381
...until they got home.

191
00:11:31,451 --> 00:11:35,762
When they looked at the car door
handle, and they found a hook!

192
00:11:37,403 --> 00:11:40,273
Gingy, cut it out! You're
really givin' me the creeps!

193
00:11:40,348 --> 00:11:43,129
Oh, come on,
I was just teasin'.

194
00:11:43,195 --> 00:11:45,945
Come here, you.

195
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:48,018
Gingy, I couldn't stay mad at you.

196
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:49,684
What was that?

197
00:11:49,755 --> 00:11:52,407
Oh, no, you don't. I'm not
fallin' for that again.

198
00:11:52,475 --> 00:11:55,377
No, I'm really, really
seriously not kidding.

199
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:58,959
Gingy!

200
00:12:05,145 --> 00:12:07,798
Suzie!

201
00:12:08,665 --> 00:12:11,251
No! No! No!

202
00:12:11,322 --> 00:12:13,744
That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

203
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:16,086
-That's not how it goes.
-You weren't there!

204
00:12:16,154 --> 00:12:19,317
All right, everyone,
I've had just about enough!

205
00:12:19,385 --> 00:12:23,476
All I wanted was a nice
Christmas with my family.

206
00:12:23,545 --> 00:12:27,604
That's exactly why we're all here!
Come on, let's finish tellin' my story.

207
00:12:27,673 --> 00:12:32,081
No, Donkey, that's not what I meant.
And get out of my chair.

208
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:35,891
-Hey, what's this?
-Donkey, let go of the book.

209
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,854
-Why are you whisperin'?
-I'm not kiddin'. Give me the book!

210
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,646
-Heimlich!
-Ja?

211
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:47,444
-No, Heimlich!
-Oh, ja!

212
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,054
My eye!

213
00:13:04,503 --> 00:13:05,964
Stop, drop and roll, Shrek!

214
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:08,079
-Somebody get some water!
-I got it!

215
00:13:08,152 --> 00:13:10,834
Don't worry, Shrek,
everything is under control!

216
00:13:10,903 --> 00:13:12,463
Oh, boy.

217
00:13:15,352 --> 00:13:17,653
-The tea is ready.
-Out!

218
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:21,646
I want everybody out
of my house right now!

219
00:13:25,111 --> 00:13:28,655
Well, that's a real nice way
to treat your guests on Christmas!

220
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:33,581
And if you think I'm gonna give you
a present now, you are sadly mistaken!

221
00:13:33,653 --> 00:13:36,074
You want to give me a present?
Then go away!

222
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,997
-That's all I wanted!
-Fine! I'm going!

223
00:13:39,062 --> 00:13:40,371
Good, then go!

224
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:44,049
You go and have yourself
a merry Christmas.

225
00:13:44,117 --> 00:13:47,597
-Ebenezer Shrek!
-And a "Bah, humbug" to you too!

226
00:13:51,925 --> 00:13:54,925
-We could come to our house.
-We have plenty of schnitzel.

227
00:13:54,997 --> 00:13:57,135
Now maybe we can...

228
00:13:58,229 --> 00:14:01,840
Fiona? Where you going?

229
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:05,356
Shrek, you just kicked
everybody out on Christmas.

230
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,795
Well, that wasn't Christmas.
That was chaos!

231
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,675
Look, I know it didn't
go like you wanted.

232
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,480
What I wanted was a perfect
Christmas for me and my family.

233
00:14:14,546 --> 00:14:17,067
-That was our family.
-You call that a family?

234
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:19,244
That was a natural disaster!

235
00:14:19,315 --> 00:14:22,130
On Christmas, that's how it
works. Yes, it was crowded.

236
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:24,169
Yes, it got
a little out of hand.

237
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:27,473
-Fiona, they lit me on fire!
-Shrek...

238
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:32,012
I had everything under control until
they showed up and ruined my Christmas!

239
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:35,246
-Your Christmas?
-I mean our Christmas.

240
00:14:35,314 --> 00:14:37,801
For you, and the babies.

241
00:14:37,874 --> 00:14:42,695
Christmas is not just about
you or me. Or even the babies.

242
00:14:44,146 --> 00:14:45,869
You just don't get it.

243
00:14:45,937 --> 00:14:50,989
I have to go. I need to
apologize to our friends.

244
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,031
Fiona, wait.

245
00:15:39,376 --> 00:15:42,277
I don't understand why
Shrek had to be so mean and cranky.

246
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:44,107
We were tryin' to do what you wanted!

247
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:46,956
-What're you talking about?
-What you said this morning.

248
00:15:47,022 --> 00:15:49,870
You and Shrek wanted to
have a big, noisy family Christmas.

249
00:15:49,934 --> 00:15:52,552
I said it was our first
Christmas together as a family.

250
00:15:52,622 --> 00:15:54,695
Right. That's me and everybody else.

251
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:56,521
Then he lost his temper like that.

252
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:59,786
You know, Donkey, none of us
really asked Shrek what he wanted.

253
00:15:59,854 --> 00:16:03,716
I must agree with the Princess.
And you, were no Christmas angel.

254
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:06,605
-I don't remember askin' you anything!
-Donkey.

255
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,451
I'm sorry, Princess. You're right.

256
00:16:09,517 --> 00:16:11,883
-Still, Shrek didn't have to be so...
-What?

257
00:16:12,941 --> 00:16:15,592
Pigheaded? Stubborn? Mean?

258
00:16:15,661 --> 00:16:20,483
Well, maybe I am all those
things, but I'm an ogre, OK?

259
00:16:20,557 --> 00:16:23,240
So here's the thing.

260
00:16:23,307 --> 00:16:26,886
I'm sorry you took getting kicked out
of my house the wrong way.

261
00:16:26,956 --> 00:16:30,633
No, wait. What I meant to say is

262
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,562
I know you're just trying to be
helpful in your irritating fashion...

263
00:16:34,636 --> 00:16:38,725
-Ay, caramba!
-Some people can't help being annoying.

264
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:41,796
-Shrek!
-Look,

265
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,940
I shouldn't have lost my temper.

266
00:16:44,012 --> 00:16:46,630
-Apology accepted. Let's eat.
-Wait a minute.

267
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,732
There's somethin' more to this.
Come on, what's goin' on?

268
00:16:49,803 --> 00:16:54,276
Look, all I wanted was to make
this perfect for my family,

269
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:58,340
but I don't even know
what Christmas means.

270
00:16:58,411 --> 00:17:01,607
The thing is,
this is my first Christmas too.

271
00:17:03,498 --> 00:17:05,920
Hold up, Shrek! You mean
that you never had...

272
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:07,041
-No.
-Not even one?

273
00:17:07,114 --> 00:17:08,608
-No!
-You mean no chestnuts,

274
00:17:08,681 --> 00:17:10,570
no Santa, no presents,
no stockings?

275
00:17:10,635 --> 00:17:12,805
-No nut cakes?!
-Donkey!

276
00:17:12,873 --> 00:17:16,102
No, none of that.

277
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:19,464
Ogres don't celebrate Christmas.

278
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:22,564
Ogres don't celebrate anything.

279
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:27,876
Oh, man, now I'm all emotional.

280
00:17:27,945 --> 00:17:30,912
-Come here, gimme a hug!
-All right, that's close enough.

281
00:17:30,985 --> 00:17:33,538
OK, all right, I just...
guess I got... a little

282
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:36,707
excited about Christmas and
all the presents and mistletoe

283
00:17:36,777 --> 00:17:39,809
and everything,
and I forgot that it's...

284
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,457
It's about us all bein' together,
and I'm... I'm sorry, Shrek.

285
00:17:43,527 --> 00:17:47,456
I know, Donkey, and... and I'm sorry
it ended up in a great big fight.

286
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:49,218
Christmas is all about big fights.

287
00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:52,703
My mama used to say, "Christmas ain't
Christmas till somebody cries."

288
00:17:52,776 --> 00:17:54,401
Usually that someone's me.

289
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:57,188
There is no right way to
do Christmas. You just do it.

290
00:17:57,255 --> 00:17:58,685
Ja, with schnitzel!

291
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,614
-And eggnog!
-And cheese!

292
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:04,802
-And family.
-Yeah. And family.

293
00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:08,928
So despite the fact that you
drive me crazy at times...

294
00:18:08,998 --> 00:18:11,519
Yes, Donkey, I'm lookin' at you.

295
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:16,063
...it would mean a lot to me if
you'd all come back and join us.

296
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:20,604
OK, I guess I deserved that.

297
00:18:20,677 --> 00:18:22,084
Don't push your luck.

298
00:18:23,078 --> 00:18:25,380
They got you good, Shrek!

299
00:18:25,446 --> 00:18:27,901
That wasn't even funny!
Who did that?

300
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:32,767
Well, that's the last
of the spare blankets.

301
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:38,942
Sorry, but this is my spot. I never get
the good spots, so I specifically...

302
00:18:40,644 --> 00:18:43,775
So we are pigs,
pigs in the blanket, ja?

303
00:18:43,845 --> 00:18:45,154
-Ja.
-Ja.

304
00:18:45,221 --> 00:18:47,490
-This is funny then, ja?
-Ja, ja.

305
00:18:47,556 --> 00:18:48,702
-This is funny.
-Ja.

306
00:18:48,773 --> 00:18:51,391
-Yep, that's a good one.
-Good night, everyone.

307
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,275
-It's time for lights out.
-We can't go to sleep yet.

308
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,642
We haven't heard a bedtime story. Right?

309
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:57,689
Shrek, yeah!

310
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,188
All right. All right.

311
00:19:02,787 --> 00:19:04,194
Don't need this.

312
00:19:04,803 --> 00:19:05,950
OK.

313
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:10,622
'Twas the night before Christmas

314
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,829
Not a swamp rat did creep

315
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,681
As mother and babe
played kazoo in their sleep

316
00:19:17,635 --> 00:19:21,050
Now, the sight of the house
would make any ogre droop

317
00:19:21,122 --> 00:19:24,471
For 'twas sickeningly sweet
as unicorn poop

318
00:19:24,546 --> 00:19:27,961
Yet who was arriving
to help this lost cause?

319
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:32,605
The foul, the vile
and handsome Ogre Claus

320
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,102
Hey. How's it goin'?

321
00:19:34,178 --> 00:19:36,830
He looked all around
and scratched at his beard

322
00:19:36,899 --> 00:19:38,686
And said...

323
00:19:38,753 --> 00:19:41,022
And said...

324
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:44,438
This place is worse
than I thought... feared.

325
00:19:44,513 --> 00:19:47,612
So he grabbed up his belly
and screwed up his face

326
00:19:47,681 --> 00:19:48,729
And let loose a...

327
00:19:50,944 --> 00:19:52,951
That transformed the place

328
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:56,124
With a gleam in his eye
his work here was done

329
00:19:56,193 --> 00:19:59,324
And then to the babies
he gave one by one

330
00:19:59,392 --> 00:20:02,207
A festering bottle
of stinky swamp juice

331
00:20:02,272 --> 00:20:05,720
And for mommy a kiss
and a good Christmas goose

332
00:20:05,793 --> 00:20:08,694
Four hundred twenty five degrees,
20 minutes per pound.

333
00:20:08,768 --> 00:20:11,965
Then digging a finger
inside of his nose

334
00:20:12,031 --> 00:20:15,907
And giving a nod up
the chimney he rose

335
00:20:16,223 --> 00:20:19,933
And I heard him exclaim
as he drove out of sight

336
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,237
"Smelly Christmas to all,
and to all a gross night!"
