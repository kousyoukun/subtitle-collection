1
00:00:36,807 --> 00:00:38,570
There. That's better.

2
00:00:43,247 --> 00:00:44,475
All clean.

3
00:00:51,455 --> 00:00:54,822
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're awake

4
00:00:54,892 --> 00:00:56,257
What are you doing here?

5
00:00:56,327 --> 00:00:59,990
- And what are you talking about?
- I'm talkin' about Santa Claus!

6
00:01:00,064 --> 00:01:03,431
Only 159 days left till
Christmas, so you better be good.

7
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,334
I'd better be good? How 'bout this? You
better be scarce. Now go on.

8
00:01:07,404 --> 00:01:09,235
I don't care about Christmas.

9
00:01:14,912 --> 00:01:17,506
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way

10
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:19,572
- Donkey!
- 51 days left till Christmas.

11
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,118
Get your butt in gear
and get your marshmallows,

12
00:01:22,186 --> 00:01:25,417
because without marshmallows,
sweet potatoes are nothin'!

13
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:29,789
Enough! I don't care
about any of this nonsense.

14
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,952
Now shoo!

15
00:01:31,028 --> 00:01:33,258
OK. But don't say
I didn't say I told you so.

16
00:01:38,669 --> 00:01:41,502
Smashing through the snow
And laughin' all the way

17
00:01:41,572 --> 00:01:45,235
It's finally here. Tomorrow's Christmas
Eve! Got everything ready?

18
00:01:45,309 --> 00:01:47,209
- No.
- You haven't trimmed stockings

19
00:01:47,277 --> 00:01:49,541
or hung your chestnuts
or roasted the tree?

20
00:01:49,613 --> 00:01:51,581
- Or figgified your puddin'?
- Donkey!

21
00:01:51,648 --> 00:01:53,445
Will you get it through your head?

22
00:01:53,517 --> 00:01:56,918
No one here gives
a hoot about Christmas!

23
00:01:56,987 --> 00:01:59,922
A white Christmas!
How perfect.

24
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,619
And it's our first one together
as a family. Isn't this exciting?

25
00:02:03,694 --> 00:02:06,288
Oh, yeah!
How 'bout that?

26
00:02:06,363 --> 00:02:08,354
There's somethin' Shrek needs to...

27
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:10,730
Don't ruin the surprise
for her, Donkey.

28
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:13,736
Surprise?
Oh, I love surprises!

29
00:02:13,804 --> 00:02:17,069
You're the best. Come on,
let's go make some cookies.

30
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:20,907
OK, you a dead man.
You know that?

31
00:02:20,978 --> 00:02:22,969
Hold that thought.
I'll be right back.

32
00:02:45,335 --> 00:02:47,326
OH, good, you're still open.

33
00:02:47,404 --> 00:02:50,339
No, we're closing now.
Merry Christmas.

34
00:02:50,407 --> 00:02:53,638
Wait, wait, wait! I need your help.
I have to make a Christmas,

35
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,338
and I have no idea
what it is or how to do it!

36
00:02:56,413 --> 00:02:58,506
Why didn't you say so?
That's super.

37
00:02:58,582 --> 00:03:01,244
I know all about Christmas,
and I've just the book.

38
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:04,446
Christmas for Village Idiots.
It's all spelled out. See?

39
00:03:04,521 --> 00:03:07,115
One, decorate house.
Two, the stockings by the fireplace.

40
00:03:07,191 --> 00:03:09,659
Step three, the Christmas feast.

41
00:03:09,726 --> 00:03:12,160
- What's that?
- Step four? The Christmas tree!

42
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:14,094
The tree goes inside the house?

43
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:18,626
Anyway, step five, the telling
of the Christmas story.

44
00:03:18,702 --> 00:03:21,899
This is the step that says
I created the perfect Christmas

45
00:03:21,972 --> 00:03:24,770
for my perfect family perfectly.
Family by the fire,

46
00:03:24,842 --> 00:03:27,367
everyone cozy and warm.
Happy, happy. Voila!

47
00:03:27,444 --> 00:03:29,241
- Sure.
- Long story short,

48
00:03:29,313 --> 00:03:31,304
it's all right here.
It's no problem.

49
00:03:31,381 --> 00:03:33,349
- Perfect.
- I mean, how hard can it be?

50
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:37,285
- I didn't get the eggnog!
- Closed?! What do you mean?

51
00:03:37,354 --> 00:03:39,652
- Dwight the Knight action figure?
- Marshmallows!

52
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:42,453
Sweet potatoes are nothing
without marshmallows!

53
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:44,585
Bye-bye. Have a super Christmas.

54
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:54,837
Honey, is that you?

55
00:03:55,806 --> 00:03:59,264
Fiona! What are
you doing up so early?

56
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,043
- Are you OK?
- I'm all right.

57
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:07,447
What are you? Are you decorating?

58
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:11,212
- Yeah, that. Surprised?
- Yes.

59
00:04:11,288 --> 00:04:14,621
Well, this is our first
Christmas together as a family,

60
00:04:14,691 --> 00:04:17,956
and, you know, I just want to
make sure that it's perfect.

61
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:21,225
Shrek, I think... it's beautiful.

62
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,198
- It's passable.
- It's horrible!

63
00:04:23,267 --> 00:04:25,633
- Donkey!
- They usually toilet paper and run.

64
00:04:25,702 --> 00:04:28,466
Whoever did this means business!
Get rid of all this

65
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:30,564
and get tinsel and doilies and ribbons

66
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:32,199
and some plastic reindeer.

67
00:04:32,276 --> 00:04:34,267
What is it you wanted today?

68
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:37,472
It's Christmas Eve!
I've brought you a little somethin'.

69
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:40,483
Go ahead, take a couple.
I bought plenty for everybody!

70
00:04:40,551 --> 00:04:43,247
Oh, isn't that... nice.

71
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,757
Well, thanks for stopping by for that
brief visit, but as you can see,

72
00:04:47,824 --> 00:04:49,587
there's a lot of work to do.

73
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,685
Just like him to wait till last minute.

74
00:04:51,762 --> 00:04:54,560
Don't worry, there's one thing I
know, it's Christmas.

75
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:57,600
He's gonna want help,
advice, and he's definitely...

76
00:04:57,668 --> 00:05:02,662
Actually, I think what he really wants
is a nice family Christmas.

77
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:06,175
Oh, a family Christmas.

78
00:05:06,243 --> 00:05:08,302
Yeah. It's the
first one with the kids.

79
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:10,812
Don't say a word.
I know exactly what you mean.

80
00:05:10,881 --> 00:05:13,349
I got a lot to do now,
so I better get movin'.

81
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:15,817
Thank you, Donkey!
And Merry Christmas!

82
00:05:15,886 --> 00:05:17,444
All right. Merry Christmas!

83
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:21,252
Love and joy come to you
and to me some waffles too

84
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:25,622
Donkey's right. It's Christmas Eve.

85
00:05:25,696 --> 00:05:28,324
How am I ever gonna
get this done in time?

86
00:05:28,398 --> 00:05:30,764
This is gonna be
the best Christmas ever.

87
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:33,200
And we're going to do it together,
so come on.

88
00:05:57,527 --> 00:06:00,519
Everything looks so good!

89
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:02,189
Nice job, honey.

90
00:06:02,265 --> 00:06:04,597
Well, we all did it together.

91
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:08,399
Now what would the perfect Christmas
be without a Christmas story?

92
00:06:09,806 --> 00:06:14,106
'Twas the night before Christmas
and all through the house

93
00:06:14,177 --> 00:06:17,578
Not a creature was stirring...
What?

94
00:06:17,648 --> 00:06:20,276
- Merry Christmas, Shrek!
- Oh, not you!

95
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,477
We're here to smother you
with Christmas love!

96
00:06:22,552 --> 00:06:25,248
Absolutely not!
Bad Donkey! Go home!

97
00:06:25,322 --> 00:06:27,688
How are you gonna have
Christmas without family?

98
00:06:27,758 --> 00:06:29,692
- Seasons greeting!
- Happy Holidays!

99
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,694
- Merry Christmas!
- A nice surprise!

100
00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:33,195
Oh, yeah.

101
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:39,860
OK, I will assume the position.

102
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,440
- I am the joy-filled swine!
- Yay, for the season of love!

103
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:50,912
This is for stockings.
You can't be hanging laundry up!

104
00:06:50,981 --> 00:06:53,108
Donkey! Don't touch anything.

105
00:06:53,884 --> 00:06:56,819
How we gonna roast chestnuts
on this little bitty fire?

106
00:06:56,887 --> 00:06:57,979
Hey, baby, you mind?

107
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:04,955
- Oh, boy!
- This way, gents.

108
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:06,926
That was our supper!

109
00:07:08,465 --> 00:07:09,762
Hey!

110
00:07:11,902 --> 00:07:15,065
Did you hurt yourself
when you fell out of heaven?

111
00:07:15,138 --> 00:07:17,572
- Where are we going to put it?
- I don't know.

112
00:07:17,641 --> 00:07:20,769
Let's put it over here.
No, that is not with the feng shui.

113
00:07:20,844 --> 00:07:22,709
Come on, everybody, let's dance!

114
00:07:34,157 --> 00:07:38,958
- Occupied!
- It's me. Shrek?

115
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:42,897
- Yes?
- Come back to the party. Please?

116
00:07:42,966 --> 00:07:45,059
I don't think
that'd be such a good idea.

117
00:07:45,135 --> 00:07:48,798
Come on. It's not that bad.

118
00:07:48,872 --> 00:07:51,739
OK, I know you're
not a party person, but...

119
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:55,209
But what? This is not the
kind of Christmas I had in mind.

120
00:07:55,278 --> 00:07:58,714
They're our friends, Shrek.
They all mean well.

121
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:01,774
- How many babies did Fiona have?
- She has babies?

122
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:04,286
- I don't know.
- I better get back to the house.

123
00:08:04,354 --> 00:08:06,379
Surprised we have
a house to go back to.

124
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:09,914
- Are you coming?
- I can hardly wait.

125
00:08:09,993 --> 00:08:11,824
Finally!

126
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,398
Look at him go!

127
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:23,371
Excuse me! Excuse me!

128
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,169
Excuse you for what?

129
00:08:25,242 --> 00:08:28,234
I don't feel very good.

130
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:32,714
- I feel better now.
- A chocolate chip!

131
00:08:32,783 --> 00:08:33,909
Sweetheart?

132
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:40,289
Mind if I cut in?

133
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:44,123
Don't stop believing

134
00:08:45,562 --> 00:08:48,463
Up and down the boulevard

135
00:08:51,268 --> 00:08:53,532
I am a little Christmas angel!

136
00:08:53,603 --> 00:08:55,571
Hey there, my sweeties.

137
00:08:57,908 --> 00:09:01,366
Would you like Daddy
to finish the story for you?

138
00:09:01,444 --> 00:09:02,706
Yeah?

139
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:05,577
The children were nestled
all snug in their beds,

140
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:09,050
- while visions of sugarplums...
- Were you tellin' 'em

141
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,088
The Night Before Christmas?
That's the best Christmas story ever!

142
00:09:12,155 --> 00:09:14,146
- I'm the best teller ever!
- Donkey...

143
00:09:14,224 --> 00:09:15,782
I got it committed
to memorization!

144
00:09:15,859 --> 00:09:17,827
- Gather round!
- Donkey! Wait!

145
00:09:17,894 --> 00:09:20,328
I'm supposed to tell
the Christmas story.

146
00:09:20,397 --> 00:09:23,389
'Twas the night before Christmas
and I spent all the day

147
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:26,333
Finishin' up on my Christmas display

148
00:09:26,403 --> 00:09:28,997
Now, missin' all this
would be nothin' but tragic

149
00:09:29,072 --> 00:09:31,836
So just follow me
and I'll show you the magic

150
00:09:31,908 --> 00:09:34,069
Now, out in the yard
in a glorious clutter

151
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:36,977
Is a spectacle there that'll
make your heart flutter

152
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:39,641
With 20-foot cheese balls
and a big eggnog fountain

153
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:42,742
And yodelin' elves
on an ambrosia mountain

154
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:45,344
A stage where acrobats
jump, leap and prance

155
00:09:45,422 --> 00:09:48,516
And honor the day
through interpretive dance

156
00:09:49,392 --> 00:09:51,758
But just when you think
the display is complete

157
00:09:51,828 --> 00:09:54,422
The Christmas parade
comes right down the street

158
00:09:54,497 --> 00:09:56,931
With holiday floats
all in silver and blue

159
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,026
With sugarplum fairies
and a reindeer or two

160
00:10:00,103 --> 00:10:02,833
There's a baton-twirlin'
snowman all happy and perky

161
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:05,807
Magical peacocks
and a dancin' roast turkey

162
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,644
And right when you think
that you've just seen it all

163
00:10:12,716 --> 00:10:16,550
Comes a huge waffle Santa
that's 50 feet tall

164
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,111
Ho, ho, ho!

165
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:22,022
With syrup and butter
the sight just amazes

166
00:10:22,092 --> 00:10:24,890
As it's flanked by a choir
all singin' his praises

167
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:35,629
- Donkey.
- Santa?

168
00:10:35,705 --> 00:10:36,967
- Donkey!
- Santa!

169
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,974
Donkey!

170
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:42,239
Very inappropriate, amigo.
Please, allow me.

171
00:10:42,312 --> 00:10:44,780
- Oh, Puss, not you too.
- In my homeland,

172
00:10:44,848 --> 00:10:47,817
we tell a very different tale
of the Santa Nicholas.

173
00:10:47,884 --> 00:10:50,216
He's not made of waffles.

174
00:10:50,287 --> 00:10:53,484
This Santa was suave
He was nothing like that

175
00:10:53,556 --> 00:10:57,788
The Santa I know
was a hot Latin cat

176
00:10:57,861 --> 00:11:01,854
He was dressed all in fur
from his head to his paws

177
00:11:01,932 --> 00:11:07,461
And he stood there heroic
A real Santa... Claws

178
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:10,097
Red are his boots

179
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:13,006
- And so is his cape
- Olé!

180
00:11:13,076 --> 00:11:17,069
His sword is a cane
that tastes like crab cake

181
00:11:17,147 --> 00:11:19,672
He wears a fine belt
and a leather cravat

182
00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:24,243
And there's a cute fuzzy thing
which hangs down from his hat

183
00:11:34,931 --> 00:11:37,525
I have shamed myself.

184
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,830
- Olé!
- All right, everybody,

185
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,770
if you leave now,
you can beat the holiday traffic.

186
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,808
Phooey with all your
sunshine and lollipops!

187
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:49,311
Where I come from,
Christmas is a nightmare.

188
00:11:51,748 --> 00:11:55,081
'Twas the night before Christmas
and the prettiest sights

189
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:59,281
Were my sweetheart beside me
in the bright Christmas lights

190
00:11:59,356 --> 00:12:01,051
...until they got home.

191
00:12:01,124 --> 00:12:05,618
When they looked at the car door
handle, and they found a hook!

192
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,322
Gingy, cut it out! You're
really givin' me the creeps!

193
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,301
Oh, come on,
I was just teasin'.

194
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,237
Come here, you.

195
00:12:16,306 --> 00:12:18,399
Gingy, I couldn't stay mad at you.

196
00:12:18,475 --> 00:12:20,136
What was that?

197
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,974
Oh, no, you don't. I'm not
fallin' for that again.

198
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:26,072
No, I'm really, really
seriously not kidding.

199
00:12:28,818 --> 00:12:29,807
Gingy!

200
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:39,023
Suzie!

201
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:42,625
No! No! No!

202
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:45,224
That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

203
00:12:45,301 --> 00:12:47,667
- That's not how it goes.
- You weren't there!

204
00:12:47,737 --> 00:12:51,036
All right, everyone,
I've had just about enough!

205
00:12:51,107 --> 00:12:55,373
All I wanted was a nice
Christmas with my family.

206
00:12:55,445 --> 00:12:59,677
That's exactly why we're all here!
Come on, let's finish tellin' my story.

207
00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:04,345
No, Donkey, that's not what I meant.
And get out of my chair.

208
00:13:05,555 --> 00:13:08,319
- Hey, what's this?
- Donkey, let go of the book.

209
00:13:08,391 --> 00:13:12,452
- Why are you whisperin'?
- I'm not kiddin'. Give me the book!

210
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,492
- Heimlich!
- Ja?

211
00:13:18,568 --> 00:13:20,365
- No, Heimlich!
- Oh, ja!

212
00:13:27,243 --> 00:13:28,301
My eye!

213
00:13:38,154 --> 00:13:39,678
Stop, drop and roll, Shrek!

214
00:13:39,756 --> 00:13:41,883
- Somebody get some water!
- I got it!

215
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,756
Don't worry, Shrek,
everything is under control!

216
00:13:44,828 --> 00:13:46,455
Oh, boy.

217
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:51,866
- The tea is ready.
- Out!

218
00:13:51,935 --> 00:13:56,031
I want everybody out
of my house right now!

219
00:13:59,642 --> 00:14:03,339
Well, that's a real nice way
to treat your guests on Christmas!

220
00:14:03,413 --> 00:14:08,476
And if you think I'm gonna give you
a present now, you are sadly mistaken!

221
00:14:08,551 --> 00:14:11,076
You want to give me a present?
Then go away!

222
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:14,123
- That's all I wanted!
- Fine! I'm going!

223
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,555
Good, then go!

224
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:19,391
You go and have yourself
a merry Christmas.

225
00:14:19,462 --> 00:14:23,091
- Ebenezer Shrek!
- And a "Bah, humbug" to you too!

226
00:14:27,604 --> 00:14:30,732
- We could come to our house.
- We have plenty of schnitzel.

227
00:14:30,807 --> 00:14:33,037
Now maybe we can...

228
00:14:34,177 --> 00:14:37,943
Fiona? Where you going?

229
00:14:38,014 --> 00:14:41,609
Shrek, you just kicked
everybody out on Christmas.

230
00:14:41,684 --> 00:14:44,152
Well, that wasn't Christmas.
That was chaos!

231
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,155
Look, I know it didn't
go like you wanted.

232
00:14:47,223 --> 00:14:51,125
What I wanted was a perfect
Christmas for me and my family.

233
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:53,822
- That was our family.
- You call that a family?

234
00:14:53,897 --> 00:14:56,092
That was a natural disaster!

235
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:59,101
On Christmas, that's how it
works. Yes, it was crowded.

236
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:01,228
Yes, it got
a little out of hand.

237
00:15:01,304 --> 00:15:04,671
- Fiona, they lit me on fire!
- Shrek...

238
00:15:04,741 --> 00:15:09,405
I had everything under control until
they showed up and ruined my Christmas!

239
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:12,778
- Your Christmas?
- I mean our Christmas.

240
00:15:12,849 --> 00:15:15,443
For you, and the babies.

241
00:15:15,518 --> 00:15:20,546
Christmas is not just about
you or me. Or even the babies.

242
00:15:22,058 --> 00:15:23,855
You just don't get it.

243
00:15:23,927 --> 00:15:29,194
I have to go. I need to
apologize to our friends.

244
00:15:29,265 --> 00:15:31,324
Fiona, wait.

245
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:22,675
I don't understand why
Shrek had to be so mean and cranky.

246
00:16:22,752 --> 00:16:24,583
We were tryin' to do what you wanted!

247
00:16:24,654 --> 00:16:27,555
- What're you talking about?
- What you said this morning.

248
00:16:27,624 --> 00:16:30,593
You and Shrek wanted to
have a big, noisy family Christmas.

249
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,390
I said it was our first
Christmas together as a family.

250
00:16:33,463 --> 00:16:35,624
Right. That's me and everybody else.

251
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:37,529
Then he lost his temper like that.

252
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,933
You know, Donkey, none of us
really asked Shrek what he wanted.

253
00:16:41,004 --> 00:16:45,031
I must agree with the Princess.
And you, were no Christmas angel.

254
00:16:45,108 --> 00:16:48,043
- I don't remember askin' you anything!
- Donkey.

255
00:16:48,111 --> 00:16:51,012
I'm sorry, Princess. You're right.

256
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,548
- Still, Shrek didn't have to be so...
- What?

257
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:57,415
Pigheaded? Stubborn? Mean?

258
00:16:57,487 --> 00:17:02,515
Well, maybe I am all those
things, but I'm an ogre, OK?

259
00:17:02,592 --> 00:17:05,390
So here's the thing.

260
00:17:05,461 --> 00:17:09,192
I'm sorry you took getting kicked out
of my house the wrong way.

261
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:13,099
No, wait. What I meant to say is

262
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:17,196
I know you're just trying to be
helpful in your irritating fashion...

263
00:17:17,273 --> 00:17:21,539
- Ay, caramba!
- Some people can't help being annoying.

264
00:17:21,611 --> 00:17:24,739
- Shrek!
- Look,

265
00:17:24,814 --> 00:17:26,975
I shouldn't have lost my temper.

266
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,780
- Apology accepted. Let's eat.
- Wait a minute.

267
00:17:29,852 --> 00:17:33,015
There's somethin' more to this.
Come on, what's goin' on?

268
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:37,753
Look, all I wanted was to make
this perfect for my family,

269
00:17:37,827 --> 00:17:41,991
but I don't even know
what Christmas means.

270
00:17:42,065 --> 00:17:45,398
The thing is,
this is my first Christmas too.

271
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,895
Hold up, Shrek! You mean
that you never had...

272
00:17:49,972 --> 00:17:51,064
- No.
- Not even one?

273
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,698
- No!
- You mean no chestnuts,

274
00:17:52,775 --> 00:17:54,743
no Santa, no presents,
no stockings?

275
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:57,075
- No nut cakes?!
- Donkey!

276
00:17:57,146 --> 00:18:00,513
No, none of that.

277
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:04,019
Ogres don't celebrate Christmas.

278
00:18:04,087 --> 00:18:07,250
Ogres don't celebrate anything.

279
00:18:10,026 --> 00:18:12,790
Oh, man, now I'm all emotional.

280
00:18:12,862 --> 00:18:15,956
- Come here, gimme a hug!
- All right, that's close enough.

281
00:18:16,032 --> 00:18:18,694
OK, all right, I just...
guess I got... a little

282
00:18:18,768 --> 00:18:21,999
excited about Christmas and
all the presents and mistletoe

283
00:18:22,071 --> 00:18:25,234
and everything,
and I forgot that it's...

284
00:18:25,308 --> 00:18:29,039
It's about us all bein' together,
and I'm... I'm sorry, Shrek.

285
00:18:29,112 --> 00:18:33,208
I know, Donkey, and... and I'm sorry
it ended up in a great big fight.

286
00:18:33,282 --> 00:18:35,045
Christmas is all about big fights.

287
00:18:35,118 --> 00:18:38,679
My mama used to say, "Christmas ain't
Christmas till somebody cries."

288
00:18:38,755 --> 00:18:40,450
Usually that someone's me.

289
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:43,356
There is no right way to
do Christmas. You just do it.

290
00:18:43,426 --> 00:18:44,916
Ja, with schnitzel!

291
00:18:44,994 --> 00:18:46,928
- And eggnog!
- And cheese!

292
00:18:46,996 --> 00:18:51,296
- And family.
- Yeah. And family.

293
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:55,599
So despite the fact that you
drive me crazy at times...

294
00:18:55,671 --> 00:18:58,299
Yes, Donkey, I'm lookin' at you.

295
00:18:58,374 --> 00:19:03,038
...it would mean a lot to me if
you'd all come back and join us.

296
00:19:04,714 --> 00:19:07,774
OK, I guess I deserved that.

297
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,317
Don't push your luck.

298
00:19:10,353 --> 00:19:12,753
They got you good, Shrek!

299
00:19:12,822 --> 00:19:15,382
That wasn't even funny!
Who did that?

300
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,456
Well, that's the last
of the spare blankets.

301
00:19:22,732 --> 00:19:26,896
Sorry, but this is my spot. I never get
the good spots, so I specifically...

302
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:31,936
So we are pigs,
pigs in the blanket, ja?

303
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:33,373
- Ja.
- Ja.

304
00:19:33,443 --> 00:19:35,809
- This is funny then, ja?
- Ja, ja.

305
00:19:35,878 --> 00:19:37,072
- This is funny.
- Ja.

306
00:19:37,146 --> 00:19:39,876
- Yep, that's a good one.
- Good night, everyone.

307
00:19:39,949 --> 00:19:42,884
- It's time for lights out.
- We can't go to sleep yet.

308
00:19:42,952 --> 00:19:45,352
We haven't heard a bedtime story. Right?

309
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:46,445
Shrek, yeah!

310
00:19:48,124 --> 00:19:50,092
All right. All right.

311
00:19:51,761 --> 00:19:53,228
Don't need this.

312
00:19:53,863 --> 00:19:55,057
OK.

313
00:19:56,699 --> 00:19:59,930
'Twas the night before Christmas

314
00:20:00,002 --> 00:20:02,232
Not a swamp rat did creep

315
00:20:02,305 --> 00:20:05,206
As mother and babe
played kazoo in their sleep

316
00:20:07,243 --> 00:20:10,804
Now, the sight of the house
would make any ogre droop

317
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,372
For 'twas sickeningly sweet
as unicorn poop

318
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:18,011
Yet who was arriving
to help this lost cause?

319
00:20:18,087 --> 00:20:22,854
The foul, the vile
and handsome Ogre Claus

320
00:20:22,925 --> 00:20:24,415
Hey. How's it goin'?

321
00:20:24,494 --> 00:20:27,258
He looked all around
and scratched at his beard

322
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,195
And said...

323
00:20:29,265 --> 00:20:31,631
And said...

324
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:35,193
This place is worse
than I thought... feared.

325
00:20:35,271 --> 00:20:38,502
So he grabbed up his belly
and screwed up his face

326
00:20:38,574 --> 00:20:39,666
And let loose a...

327
00:20:41,978 --> 00:20:44,071
That transformed the place

328
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:47,377
With a gleam in his eye
his work here was done

329
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,715
And then to the babies
he gave one by one

330
00:20:50,786 --> 00:20:53,721
A festering bottle
of stinky swamp juice

331
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:57,384
And for mommy a kiss
and a good Christmas goose

332
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,486
Four hundred twenty five degrees,
20 minutes per pound.

333
00:21:00,563 --> 00:21:03,896
Then digging a finger
inside of his nose

334
00:21:03,966 --> 00:21:08,007
And giving a nod up
the chimney he rose

335
00:21:08,337 --> 00:21:12,205
And I heard him exclaim
as he drove out of sight

336
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:17,736
"Smelly Christmas to all,
and to all a gross night!"

337
00:21:18,514 --> 00:21:22,211
Ho, ho, ho!

338
00:21:22,285 --> 00:21:24,276
Ho, ho, ho!

339
00:21:24,353 --> 00:21:27,379
- Ho, ho, ho!
- Santa?!

340
00:21:28,357 --> 00:21:31,417
Ho, ho, ho!

341
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:51,367
