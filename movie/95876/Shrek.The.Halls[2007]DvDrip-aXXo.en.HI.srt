296
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,280
I still don't understand
why Shrek had to be
so mean and cranky.

297
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,200
We were tryin'
to do what you wanted us to do!

298
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,880
- What are you talking about?
- What you said this mornin'.

299
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,960
You know, you and Shrek
wanted to have a big old
noisy family Christmas.

300
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,480
No, I said it was our first
Christmas together as a family.

301
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,800
A family, right.
That's me and everybody else.

302
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,680
Then he lost
his temper like that.

303
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,840
You know, Donkey,
none of us really
asked Shrek what he wanted.

304
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,680
Well, I must agree with the
Princess. And you, especially,
were no Christmas angel.

305
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,720
- You know, I don't remember
askin' you anything!
- Donkey.

306
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,520
[sighs] I'm sorry, Princess.
You're right.

307
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,840
- Even still, Shrek
didn't have to be so...
- What?

308
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,040
- [yelling]
- [meowing]

309
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,720
Pigheaded? Stubborn? Mean?

310
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,680
Well, maybe I am all those
things, but I'm an ogre, OK?

311
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,400
So here's the thing.
[clears throat]

312
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,120
I'm sorry you took
getting kicked out
of my house the wrong way.

313
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,720
No, wait.
What I meant to say is

314
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,360
I know you're all just trying
to be helpful in your
own irritating fashion...

315
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,920

can't help being annoying.</i>

316
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,920

- Look,

317
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,080
I shouldn't have lost
my temper back there.

318
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,600
- Apology accepted. Let's eat.
- Wait a minute.

319
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,880
Now, there's somethin'
more to this. Come on now,
what's goin' on?

320
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,440
Look, all I wanted was to make
this perfect for my family,

321
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,440
but I don't even know
what Christmas means.

322
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:03,200
The thing is,
this is my first Christmas too.

323
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,160
Whoa, hold up, Shrek! You mean
to tell me that you never had...

324
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,240
- No.
- Not even one?

325
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,640
- No!
- You mean no chestnuts,

326
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,640
no Santa, no presents,
no stockings?

327
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,800
- [gasps] No nut cakes?!
- Donkey!

328
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,200
No, none of that.

329
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,640
Ogres don't celebrate Christmas.

330
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,040
Ogres don't celebrate anything.

331
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,120
Oh, man, now I'm all emotional.

332
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,120
- Come here, Shrek, gimme a hug!
- All right,
that's close enough.

333
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,600
OK, all right, I just...
guess I got... a little

334
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,560
excited about Christmas and
all the presents and mistletoe

335
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,760
and [sniffs] everything,
and I forgot that it's...

336
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,440
It's about us all bein'
together, and I'm...
I'm sorry, Shrek.

337
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,600
I know, Donkey, and...
and I'm sorry it ended up
in a great big fight.

338
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,320
Oh, Christmas
is all about big fights.

339
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,440
My mama used to say,
"Christmas ain't Christmas
till somebody cries."

340
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,440
- Usually that someone's me.
- Boss,

341
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,880
<i>- there is no right way to
do Christmas. You just do it.
- Ja, with schnitzel!</i>

342
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,680

- Yeah. And family.

344
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,000
So despite the fact that you
drive me crazy at times...

345
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,600
Yes, Donkey,
I'm lookin' at you.

346
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:16,240
...it would mean a lot to me if
you'd all come back and join us.

347
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,560
[chuckling] OK,
I guess I deserved that.

348
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,840

351
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,320
[babies cooing]

352
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,120
[Fiona] Well, that's the last
of the spare blankets.

353
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,720

We can't go to sleep yet.

361
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,720
We haven't heard a bedtime
story. Right, everybody?

362
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,280

Hey. How's it goin'?

375
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,560
<i>He looked all around

379
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,240

Up the chimney he rose

389
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,520

as he drove out of sight
