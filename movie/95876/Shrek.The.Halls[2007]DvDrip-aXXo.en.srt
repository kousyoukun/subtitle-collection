1
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,007
There.
That's better.

2
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,640
All clean.

3
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,560
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're awake

4
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,960
What are you doing here?

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,520
- And what are you talking about?
- I'm talkin' about Santa Claus!

6
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,840
Only 159 days left till
Christmas, so you better be good.

7
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,560
I'd better be good? How 'bout this? You
better be scarce. Now go on.

8
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,400
I don't care about Christmas.

9
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,320
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way

10
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,320
- Donkey!
- 51 days left till Christmas.

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,760
Get your butt in gear
and get your marshmallows,

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,920
because without marshmallows,
sweet potatoes are nothin'!

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,120
Enough! I don't care
about any of this nonsense.

14
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,240
Now shoo!

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,440
OK. But don't say
I didn't say I told you so.

16
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,360
Smashing through the snow
And laughin' all the way

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,920
It's finally here. Tomorrow's Christmas
Eve! Got everything ready?

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,800
- No.
- You haven't trimmed stockings

19
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,040
or hung your chestnuts
or roasted the tree?

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,000
- Or figgified your puddin'?
- Donkey!

21
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,800
Will you get it through your head?

22
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,120
No one here gives
a hoot about Christmas!

23
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,000
A white Christmas!
How perfect.

24
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,560
And it's our first one together
as a family. Isn't this exciting?

25
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,120
Oh, yeah!
How 'bout that?

26
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,080
There's somethin' Shrek needs to...

27
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,360
Don't ruin the surprise
for her, Donkey.

28
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,240
Surprise?
Oh, I love surprises!

29
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,440
You're the best. Come on,
let's go make some cookies.

30
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,120
OK, you a dead man.
You know that?

31
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,120
Hold that thought.
I'll be right back.

32
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,480
OH, good, you're still open.

33
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,360
No, we're closing now.
Merry Christmas.

34
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,520
Wait, wait, wait! I need your help.
I have to make a Christmas,

35
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,120
and I have no idea
what it is or how to do it!

36
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
Why didn't you say so?
That's super.

37
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,840
I know all about Christmas,
and I've just the book.

38
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,880
Christmas for Village Idiots.
It's all spelled out. See?

39
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,440
One, decorate house.
Two, the stockings by the fireplace.

40
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,880
Step three, the Christmas feast.

41
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,280
- What's that?
- Step four? The Christmas tree!

42
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,160
The tree goes inside the house?

43
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,480
Anyway, step five, the telling
of the Christmas story.

44
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,640
This is the step that says
I created the perfect Christmas

45
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,400
for my perfect family perfectly.
Family by the fire,

46
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,880
everyone cozy and warm.
Happy, happy. Voila!

47
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,680
- Sure.
- Long story short,

48
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,640
it's all right here.
It's no problem.

49
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,600
- Perfect.
- I mean, how hard can it be?

50
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,400
- I didn't get the eggnog!
- Closed?! What do you mean?

51
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,640
- Dwight the Knight action figure?
- Marshmallows!

52
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,360
Sweet potatoes are nothing
without marshmallows!

53
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Bye-bye. Have a super Christmas.

54
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,200
Honey, is that you?

55
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,480
Fiona! What are
you doing up so early?

56
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,080
- Are you OK?
- I'm all right.

57
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,320
What are you? Are you decorating?

58
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,920
- Yeah, that. Surprised?
- Yes.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,200
Well, this is our first
Christmas together as a family,

60
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,400
and, you know, I just want to
make sure that it's perfect.

61
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,520
Shrek, I think... it's beautiful.

62
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,400
- It's passable.
- It's horrible!

63
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,760
- Donkey!
- They usually toilet paper and run.

64
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,480
Whoever did this means business!
Get rid of all this

65
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,480
and get tinsel and doilies and ribbons

66
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,040
and some plastic reindeer.

67
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,040
What is it you wanted today?

68
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,120
It's Christmas Eve!
I've brought you a little somethin'.

69
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,000
Go ahead, take a couple.
I bought plenty for everybody!

70
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,640
Oh, isn't that... nice.

71
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,960
Well, thanks for stopping by for that
brief visit, but as you can see,

72
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,720
there's a lot of work to do.

73
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,720
Just like him to wait till last minute.

74
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,480
Don't worry, there's one thing I
know, it's Christmas.

75
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,400
He's gonna want help,
advice, and he's definitely...

76
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,280
Actually, I think what he really wants
is a nice family Christmas.

77
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,640
Oh, a family Christmas.

78
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
Yeah. It's the
first one with the kids.

79
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,080
Don't say a word.
I know exactly what you mean.

80
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,520
I got a lot to do now,
so I better get movin'.

81
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,880
Thank you, Donkey!
And Merry Christmas!

82
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,440
All right. Merry Christmas!

83
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,080
Love and joy come to you
and to me some waffles too

84
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,280
Donkey's right. It's Christmas Eve.

85
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,880
How am I ever gonna
get this done in time?

86
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,200
This is gonna be
the best Christmas ever.

87
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,560
And we're going to do it together,
so come on.

88
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,760
Everything looks so good!

89
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,360
Nice job, honey.

90
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,680
Well, we all did it together.

91
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,320
Now what would the perfect Christmas
be without a Christmas story?

92
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,800
'Twas the night before Christmas
and all through the house

93
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,120
Not a creature was stirring...
What?

94
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,680
- Merry Christmas, Shrek!
- Oh, not you!

95
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,800
We're here to smother you
with Christmas love!

96
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,480
Absolutely not!
Bad Donkey! Go home!

97
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,800
How are you gonna have
Christmas without family?

98
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,720
- Seasons greeting!
- Happy Holidays!

99
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,640
- Merry Christmas!
- A nice surprise!

100
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,080
Oh, yeah.

101
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,480
OK, I will assume the position.

102
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,760
- I am the joy-filled swine!
- Yay, for the season of love!

103
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,080
This is for stockings.
You can't be hanging laundry up!

104
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,200
Donkey! Don't touch anything.

105
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,760
How we gonna roast chestnuts
on this little bitty fire?

106
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,840
Hey, baby, you mind?

107
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,560
- Oh, boy!
- This way, gents.

108
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,440
That was our supper!

109
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,160
Hey!

110
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,240
Did you hurt yourself
when you fell out of heaven?

111
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,640
- Where are we going to put it?
- I don't know.

112
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,720
Let's put it over here.
No, that is not with the feng shui.

113
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,560
Come on, everybody, let's dance!

114
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,160
- Occupied!
- It's me. Shrek?

115
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,920
- Yes?
- Come back to the party. Please?

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I don't think
that'd be such a good idea.

117
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,600
Come on. It's not that bad.

118
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,400
OK, I know you're
not a party person, but...

119
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,760
But what? This is not the
kind of Christmas I had in mind.

120
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,120
They're our friends, Shrek.
They all mean well.

121
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,040
- How many babies did Fiona have?
- She has babies?

122
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,440
- I don't know.
- I better get back to the house.

123
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,440
Surprised we have
a house to go back to.

124
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,840
- Are you coming?
- I can hardly wait.

125
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,680
Finally!

126
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,880
Look at him go!

127
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,760
Excuse me! Excuse me!

128
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,480
Excuse you for what?

129
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,400
I don't feel very good.

130
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,720
- I feel better now.
- A chocolate chip!

131
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,840
Sweetheart?

132
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,960
Mind if I cut in?

133
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,640
Don't stop believing

134
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,800
Up and down the boulevard

135
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,680
I am a little Christmas angel!

136
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,640
Hey there, my sweeties.

137
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,200
Would you like Daddy
to finish the story for you?

138
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,480
Yeah?

139
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,240
The children were nestled
all snug in their beds,

140
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,560
- while visions of sugarplums...
- Were you tellin' 'em

141
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,480
The Night Before Christmas?
That's the best Christmas story ever!

142
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,440
- I'm the best teller ever!
- Donkey...

143
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,000
I got it committed
to memorization!

144
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,960
- Gather round!
- Donkey! Wait!

145
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,360
I'm supposed to tell
the Christmas story.

146
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,320
'Twas the night before Christmas
and I spent all the day

147
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,120
Finishin' up on my Christmas display

148
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,680
Now, missin' all this
would be nothin' but tragic

149
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,400
So just follow me
and I'll show you the magic

150
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,560
Now, out in the yard
in a glorious clutter

151
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,360
Is a spectacle there that'll
make your heart flutter

152
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,880
With 20-foot cheese balls
and a big eggnog fountain

153
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,880
And yodelin' elves
on an ambrosia mountain

154
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,360
A stage where acrobats
jump, leap and prance

155
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,400
And honor the day
through interpretive dance

156
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,520
But just when you think
the display is complete

157
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,080
The Christmas parade
comes right down the street

158
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,480
With holiday floats
all in silver and blue

159
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,440
With sugarplum fairies
and a reindeer or two

160
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,160
There's a baton-twirlin'
snowman all happy and perky

161
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,000
Magical peacocks
and a dancin' roast turkey

162
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,560
And right when you think
that you've just seen it all

163
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,280
Comes a huge waffle Santa
that's 50 feet tall

164
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,760
Ho, ho, ho!

165
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,560
With syrup and butter
the sight just amazes

166
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,280
As it's flanked by a choir
all singin' his praises

167
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,600
- Donkey.
- Santa?

168
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,880
- Donkey!
- Santa!

169
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,800
Donkey!

170
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,920
Very inappropriate, amigo.
Please, allow me.

171
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,360
- Oh, Puss, not you too.
- In my homeland,

172
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,280
we tell a very different tale
of the Santa Nicholas.

173
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,600
He's not made of waffles.

174
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,720
This Santa was suave
He was nothing like that

175
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,840
The Santa I know
was a hot Latin cat

176
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,760
He was dressed all in fur
from his head to his paws

177
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,120
And he stood there heroic
A real Santa... Claws

178
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,640
Red are his boots

179
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,440
- And so is his cape
- Olé!

180
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,320
His sword is a cane
that tastes like crab cake

181
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,840
He wears a fine belt
and a leather cravat

182
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,200
And there's a cute fuzzy thing
which hangs down from his hat

183
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,960
I have shamed myself.

184
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,160
- Olé!
- All right, everybody,

185
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,000
if you leave now,
you can beat the holiday traffic.

186
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,880
Phooey with all your
sunshine and lollipops!

187
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,240
Where I come from,
Christmas is a nightmare.

188
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,800
'Twas the night before Christmas
and the prettiest sights

189
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,800
Were my sweetheart beside me
in the bright Christmas lights

190
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,520
...until they got home.

191
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,880
When they looked at the car door
handle, and they found a hook!

192
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,400
Gingy, cut it out! You're
really givin' me the creeps!

193
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,280
Oh, come on,
I was just teasin'.

194
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,080
Come here, you.

195
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Gingy, I couldn't stay mad at you.

196
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,840
What was that?

197
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,560
Oh, no, you don't. I'm not
fallin' for that again.

198
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,520
No, I'm really, really
seriously not kidding.

199
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,080
Gingy!

200
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,920
Suzie!

201
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,400
No! No! No!

202
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,880
That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

203
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,240
- That's not how it goes.
- You weren't there!

204
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,440
All right, everyone,
I've had just about enough!

205
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,600
All I wanted was a nice
Christmas with my family.

206
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,760
That's exactly why we're all here!
Come on, let's finish tellin' my story.

207
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,200
No, Donkey, that's not what I meant.
And get out of my chair.

208
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,040
- Hey, what's this?
- Donkey, let go of the book.

209
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,000
- Why are you whisperin'?
- I'm not kiddin'. Give me the book!

210
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,800
- Heimlich!
- Ja?

211
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,600
- No, Heimlich!
- Oh, ja!

212
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,200
My eye!

213
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,120
Stop, drop and roll, Shrek!

214
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,200
- Somebody get some water!
- I got it!

215
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,960
Don't worry, Shrek,
everything is under control!

216
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,600
Oh, boy.

217
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,800
- The tea is ready.
- Out!

218
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,800
I want everybody out
of my house right now!

219
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,800
Well, that's a real nice way
to treat your guests on Christmas!

220
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,720
And if you think I'm gonna give you
a present now, you are sadly mistaken!

221
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,200
You want to give me a present?
Then go away!

222
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,120
- That's all I wanted!
- Fine! I'm going!

223
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,520
Good, then go!

224
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,200
You go and have yourself
a merry Christmas.

225
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,720
- Ebenezer Shrek!
- And a "Bah, humbug" to you too!

226
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,080
- We could come to our house.
- We have plenty of schnitzel.

227
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,280
Now maybe we can...

228
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,000
Fiona? Where you going?

229
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,480
Shrek, you just kicked
everybody out on Christmas.

230
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,920
Well, that wasn't Christmas.
That was chaos!

231
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,800
Look, I know it didn't
go like you wanted.

232
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,640
What I wanted was a perfect
Christmas for me and my family.

233
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,200
- That was our family.
- You call that a family?

234
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,400
That was a natural disaster!

235
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,280
On Christmas, that's how it
works. Yes, it was crowded.

236
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,320
Yes, it got
a little out of hand.

237
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,600
- Fiona, they lit me on fire!
- Shrek...

238
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,160
I had everything under control until
they showed up and ruined my Christmas!

239
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,400
- Your Christmas?
- I mean our Christmas.

240
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,960
For you, and the babies.

241
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,840
Christmas is not just about
you or me. Or even the babies.

242
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,000
You just don't get it.

243
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:51,120
I have to go. I need to
apologize to our friends.

244
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,160
Fiona, wait.

245
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,440
I don't understand why
Shrek had to be so mean and cranky.

246
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,240
We were tryin' to do what you wanted!

247
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,120
- What're you talking about?
- What you said this morning.

248
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,000
You and Shrek wanted to
have a big, noisy family Christmas.

249
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,720
I said it was our first
Christmas together as a family.

250
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,840
Right. That's me and everybody else.

251
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,680
Then he lost his temper like that.

252
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,920
You know, Donkey, none of us
really asked Shrek what he wanted.

253
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,880
I must agree with the Princess.
And you, were no Christmas angel.

254
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,760
- I don't remember askin' you anything!
- Donkey.

255
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,600
I'm sorry, Princess. You're right.

256
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,040
- Still, Shrek didn't have to be so...
- What?

257
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,760
Pigheaded? Stubborn? Mean?

258
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,640
Well, maybe I am all those
things, but I'm an ogre, OK?

259
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,400
So here's the thing.

260
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,040
I'm sorry you took getting kicked out
of my house the wrong way.

261
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,800
No, wait. What I meant to say is

262
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,720
I know you're just trying to be
helpful in your irritating fashion...

263
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,880
- Ay, caramba!
- Some people can't help being annoying.

264
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,960
- Shrek!
- Look,

265
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,080
I shouldn't have lost my temper.

266
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,800
- Apology accepted. Let's eat.
- Wait a minute.

267
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,880
There's somethin' more to this.
Come on, what's goin' on?

268
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,440
Look, all I wanted was to make
this perfect for my family,

269
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,480
but I don't even know
what Christmas means.

270
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,760
The thing is,
this is my first Christmas too.

271
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,080
Hold up, Shrek! You mean
that you never had...

272
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,200
- No.
- Not even one?

273
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,760
- No!
- You mean no chestnuts,

274
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,720
no Santa, no presents,
no stockings?

275
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,960
- No nut cakes?!
- Donkey!

276
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,240
No, none of that.

277
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,600
Ogres don't celebrate Christmas.

278
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,720
Ogres don't celebrate anything.

279
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,040
Oh, man, now I'm all emotional.

280
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,080
- Come here, gimme a hug!
- All right, that's close enough.

281
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,680
OK, all right, I just...
guess I got... a little

282
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,880
excited about Christmas and
all the presents and mistletoe

283
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,960
and everything,
and I forgot that it's...

284
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,600
It's about us all bein' together,
and I'm... I'm sorry, Shrek.

285
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,600
I know, Donkey, and... and I'm sorry
it ended up in a great big fight.

286
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,360
Christmas is all about big fights.

287
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,840
My mama used to say, "Christmas ain't
Christmas till somebody cries."

288
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,560
Usually that someone's me.

289
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,360
There is no right way to
do Christmas. You just do it.

290
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,840
Ja, with schnitzel!

291
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,760
- And eggnog!
- And cheese!

292
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,960
- And family.
- Yeah. And family.

293
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,080
So despite the fact that you
drive me crazy at times...

294
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,680
Yes, Donkey, I'm lookin' at you.

295
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,200
...it would mean a lot to me if
you'd all come back and join us.

296
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,760
OK, I guess I deserved that.

297
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,240
Don't push your luck.

298
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,520
They got you good, Shrek!

299
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,040
That wasn't even funny!
Who did that?

300
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,920
Well, that's the last
of the spare blankets.

301
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,080
Sorry, but this is my spot. I never get
the good spots, so I specifically...

302
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,920
So we are pigs,
pigs in the blanket, ja?

303
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,320
- Ja.
- Ja.

304
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,640
- This is funny then, ja?
- Ja, ja.

305
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,840
- This is funny.
- Ja.

306
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,560
- Yep, that's a good one.
- Good night, everyone.

307
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,440
- It's time for lights out.
- We can't go to sleep yet.

308
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,800
We haven't heard a bedtime story. Right?

309
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,840
Shrek, yeah!

310
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,360
All right. All right.

311
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,360
Don't need this.

312
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,120
OK.

313
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,800
'Twas the night before Christmas

314
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,000
Not a swamp rat did creep

315
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,840
As mother and babe
played kazoo in their sleep

316
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,200
Now, the sight of the house
would make any ogre droop

317
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,640
For 'twas sickeningly sweet
as unicorn poop

318
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,120
Yet who was arriving
to help this lost cause?

319
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,760
The foul, the vile
and handsome Ogre Claus

320
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,280
Hey. How's it goin'?

321
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,000
He looked all around
and scratched at his beard

322
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,840
And said...

323
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,200
And said...

324
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,600
This place is worse
than I thought... feared.

325
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,760
So he grabbed up his belly
and screwed up his face

326
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,880
And let loose a...

327
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
That transformed the place

328
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,280
With a gleam in his eye
his work here was done

329
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,480
And then to the babies
he gave one by one

330
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,360
A festering bottle
of stinky swamp juice

331
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,880
And for mommy a kiss
and a good Christmas goose

332
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,840
Four hundred twenty five degrees,
20 minutes per pound.

333
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,120
Then digging a finger
inside of his nose

334
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,080
And giving a nod up
the chimney he rose

335
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,080
And I heard him exclaim
as he drove out of sight

336
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,400
"Smelly Christmas to all,
and to all a gross night!"

337
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,680
Ho, ho, ho!

338
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,680
Ho, ho, ho!

339
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,640
- Ho, ho, ho!
- Santa?!

340
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,520
Ho, ho, ho!

341
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,920
