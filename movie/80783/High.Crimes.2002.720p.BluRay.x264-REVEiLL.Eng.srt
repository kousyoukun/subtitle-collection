1
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:15,277
If you can,
check out the Marin County Arts Fair.

2
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:19,138
It'll be going on
through Thanks giving.

3
00:02:19,448 --> 00:02:24,010
Well, nothing's changed.
We've got fog in the East Bay...

4
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:26,514
...and here in San Francisco.

5
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:31,316
And We're looking at a high of
68 once these clouds burn off.

6
00:02:31,627 --> 00:02:34,187
The time now is 23 after 7.

7
00:02:36,132 --> 00:02:37,963
Oh, my gosh!

8
00:02:50,746 --> 00:02:53,306
Hello!

9
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:10,992
Honey! Turn it off.

10
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,864
We gotta make a baby.

11
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:21,040
Yeah.

12
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:28,413
- I have an issue that... Resolved first.
- We have an issue that needs resolving.

13
00:03:28,717 --> 00:03:30,207
- Right now.
- It's red.

14
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,421
Okay. I'll talk to you later.
I thought you had a hearing.

15
00:03:34,723 --> 00:03:39,626
I do. We've got 7 minutes for us, 15
for resting with my hips elevated...

16
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:43,662
...and I'll only be 4 minutes late
if there's no traffic.

17
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:46,628
How about 10 for us,
12 for your hips?

18
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:51,771
- 9 and 13.
- Okay, deal. Come here.

19
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:57,275
No, wait. It's supposed
to work better if you're on top.

20
00:03:57,646 --> 00:04:02,743
I thought I'd never hear you say that.
It's so nice.

21
00:04:15,264 --> 00:04:18,893
They said reduced sentence,
but I can get a new trial.

22
00:04:19,268 --> 00:04:23,102
Claire, it's a first offense.
We can ask for leniency.

23
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:27,207
The forewoman's an advocate.
She's not an impartial juror.

24
00:04:27,543 --> 00:04:31,001
This is a rape case.
I don't Want to piss the judge off.

25
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:34,111
Trust me on this, Alex.

26
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,647
Tell me you're joking.

27
00:04:35,851 --> 00:04:38,445
Your Honor,
my client is facing jail time...

28
00:04:38,721 --> 00:04:41,918
...while they're laughing
all the way to CNN.

29
00:04:42,124 --> 00:04:45,389
- That's ridiculous.
- Juror nine is a rape victim.

30
00:04:45,694 --> 00:04:49,721
And she's a fundraiser
for a sexual assault hotline.

31
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:54,333
The prosecution should have submitted
that at the voir dire.

32
00:04:54,637 --> 00:04:58,903
- The misconduct does not stop there.
- Oh, really?

33
00:04:59,241 --> 00:05:02,677
This office handled juror nine's case
eight years ago...

34
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:06,210
...and it's hard to believe
no one recognized her.

35
00:05:06,548 --> 00:05:07,845
This is outrageous.

36
00:05:09,385 --> 00:05:11,512
Do you feel justice was served?

37
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:14,288
We're pleased Gary Norris
will get a new trial.

38
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,559
His victim might say
she's been raped by the system.

39
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,452
My heart goes out to her.

40
00:05:19,795 --> 00:05:23,925
But when a defendant's rights
are violated, we are all at risk.

41
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,594
- Good job.
- Thanks.

42
00:05:28,671 --> 00:05:33,438
- Good job. I need to talk to you.
- Good. I need gossip.

43
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:39,143
- That was luck, you big...
- Just like your Bruins last night.

44
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:40,712
She scores again.

45
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:45,182
The heart of democracy beats on.
Would you punch up my calendar?

46
00:05:45,454 --> 00:05:49,049
- Personal or business?
- Both. Thanks. Hi, big guy.

47
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:53,193
- Good work. We're proud of you.
- Thank you very much.

48
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:57,488
I'll just type "partner" in
right here, next to January 1.

49
00:05:57,766 --> 00:06:00,860
I didn't know you were clairvoyant.

50
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:03,970
Really? Are you serious?

51
00:06:04,273 --> 00:06:06,241
We'll see.

52
00:06:09,878 --> 00:06:14,577
Not bad. I think that was just lucky.

53
00:06:15,284 --> 00:06:17,582
- Bring it on, girl.
- Pretty.

54
00:06:17,886 --> 00:06:20,787
- Pretty nice.
- Pretty lucky. Well...

55
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,821
- I'm taking you to pool school.
- You don't have a shot.

56
00:06:25,294 --> 00:06:30,527
- 15 off the 5 in the corner pocket.
- Not in this lifetime.

57
00:06:35,504 --> 00:06:38,166
That is not fair. That is not fair!

58
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,599
No, you can't use your left hand now.

59
00:06:43,345 --> 00:06:45,540
You are a mutant.

60
00:06:46,515 --> 00:06:48,278
Hey, look.

61
00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:51,782
- This Was City Hall today.
- Do you feel justice Was served?

62
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,386
We're pleased Gary Norris...

63
00:06:54,656 --> 00:06:56,385
Oh, my gosh!

64
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,689
You look great!

65
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,824
Look at you!

66
00:07:02,197 --> 00:07:04,722
- We are all at risk.

67
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,868
Any comments for the family?

68
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:23,501
Honey. Lock the door.
Someone's in the house.

69
00:09:02,117 --> 00:09:04,517
- Hurry!
- Wait up!

70
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,248
Damn kids.

71
00:09:12,294 --> 00:09:13,989
It's okay, honey.

72
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:19,132
25 Dover. Send somebody right away.
Are you okay?

73
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,166
Oh, God.

74
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:31,370
I'm fine.

75
00:09:44,927 --> 00:09:48,522
- How old is he?
- Fourteen months.

76
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:51,631
Uh-oh, baby alert.

77
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:55,359
Hi. Could we meet your baby?

78
00:09:56,004 --> 00:09:59,599
Hi! Oh, my God, what a doll.

79
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,776
He's in a pretty good mood.

80
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:25,755
He doesn't have on a T-shirt
or something.

81
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:30,936
The movie was a huge hit. Men all
across America quit buying T-shirts.

82
00:10:31,273 --> 00:10:34,299
Oh, is it like It's a Wonderful Life?

83
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:40,109
Nice. Christmas domestic.
Yeah, that's the spirit.

84
00:10:40,382 --> 00:10:43,840
Interesting. Real interesting.

85
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:46,485
IKeys, please.

86
00:10:50,325 --> 00:10:51,849
What is it, babe?

87
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:55,059
FBI! Get down!

88
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:58,790
Get down! Get down!

89
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:04,866
Get down! On the ground!
On the ground, now!

90
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,774
Stop! Leave her alone!

91
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:22,751
- You screwed up the whole thing.
- You're looking at a lawsuit, Mulkins.

92
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:25,357
Harassment. Reckless endangerment.

93
00:11:25,594 --> 00:11:29,086
It's Mullins, Mrs. Ikubik.
Special Agent Mullins.

94
00:11:29,297 --> 00:11:31,788
You have a warrant for Ron Chapman.

95
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,467
My husband is Tom Ikubik.
Your computer is psychotic.

96
00:11:35,771 --> 00:11:39,605
It wasn't our computer.
If you had gotten any closer...

97
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:44,642
...you would have burned the guy,
all right? Fine, forget about it.

98
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:50,043
It was Marin P.D. They ran the prints
after your house was burglarized.

99
00:11:50,352 --> 00:11:55,221
They flagged your husband's. They've
been in the system for 12 years.

100
00:11:55,524 --> 00:11:59,585
- What is he being accused of?
- Sorry, I can't tell you.

101
00:11:59,895 --> 00:12:03,888
Oh, come on. I have the right
to know the charges.

102
00:12:04,232 --> 00:12:09,192
Not when it's a military court
or when national security is involved.

103
00:12:09,905 --> 00:12:12,373
Military court?

104
00:12:56,551 --> 00:13:00,351
Thank God I caught you.
I was afraid you'd be out of town.

105
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:04,716
I caught you on the news.
Stop letting them mess with your hair.

106
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,428
- Jackie?
- I need money. I hate to ask.

107
00:13:07,763 --> 00:13:10,789
Well, not really.
Can you just help me out?

108
00:13:11,032 --> 00:13:15,901
My landlord's breathing down my neck.
If you say no, I'll be evicted.

109
00:13:16,138 --> 00:13:17,469
Can you come get me?

110
00:13:21,076 --> 00:13:25,445
I know what it is. Maybe he did
something he doesn't know he did.

111
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,012
- And so he...
- That's enough.

112
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,751
- No, but he's in witness protection...
- Just stop it.

113
00:13:31,987 --> 00:13:36,856
Sorry. Next time you need help,
call your other sister.

114
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:39,719
Oh, wait,
you don't have another sister.

115
00:13:39,928 --> 00:13:41,486
You called me, Jackie.

116
00:13:41,797 --> 00:13:47,360
I picked you up. It's the first time
you've tried to see me in months.

117
00:13:54,075 --> 00:13:57,943
The base is in San Lazaro,
45 minutes south of L.A.

118
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,579
I booked you a flight
into Orange County.

119
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:07,116
- Okay, With luggage?
- You should be on the base by 11:30.

120
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,576
Good afternoon.
May I see your I.D.?

121
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,477
All right.

122
00:15:37,212 --> 00:15:41,911
Mrs. Ikubik. James Hernandez.
Ron and I were in the same unit.

123
00:15:42,117 --> 00:15:46,281
This must be a shock.
If there's anything I can do...

124
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:50,456
Atchison, Chapman, Green.

125
00:15:50,692 --> 00:15:53,923
Ron was a good Marine.
I won't keep you. Good luck.

126
00:15:54,195 --> 00:15:57,722
- Thank you.
- At the end of the hall, ma'am.

127
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,999
Room B, ma'am.

128
00:16:24,826 --> 00:16:26,691
What the...?

129
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:32,428
- Where are his clothes?
- Suicide watch.

130
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:34,167
Put clothes on him now!

131
00:16:34,469 --> 00:16:38,530
You'd have to file that request
with the brig command.

132
00:16:58,593 --> 00:17:02,188
Is your name Ron Chapman?

133
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,566
Yes.

134
00:17:36,331 --> 00:17:39,892
I don't know what to say.

135
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,767
I had no choice.

136
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:47,370
I had no...
I had no choice.

137
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:52,772
They were accusing me of something
that I didn't do. Please believe me.

138
00:17:53,581 --> 00:17:56,015
Believe you?

139
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:05,219
Well, I believed that you
were raised in a foster home.

140
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,052
- I was.
- That you were never married.

141
00:18:09,364 --> 00:18:14,392
That you don't have any children.
That you loved me, Ron.

142
00:18:15,437 --> 00:18:19,737
Tom? Whatever your name is.

143
00:18:24,612 --> 00:18:30,312
I do love you, but I did not do this.

144
00:18:36,257 --> 00:18:40,921
I swear that I never did this.

145
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:46,957
And I didn't want to tell you
because I didn't want you to leave me.

146
00:18:56,711 --> 00:18:57,678
What happened?

147
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,979
My lawyer's here.

148
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:08,151
Mrs. Ikubik?

149
00:19:08,456 --> 00:19:13,325
Sorry to interrupt.
First Lieutenant Embry, Terrence.

150
00:19:16,931 --> 00:19:20,799
I'm older than I look. So...

151
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:28,798
Well, I'll let you twos...
I'll wait in the...

152
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,650
Claire.

153
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:41,618
Just let me go talk to him, okay?

154
00:19:50,665 --> 00:19:53,156
First lieutenant?
Is that what I call you?

155
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:54,368
Lieutenant.

156
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:58,901
Why haven't you filed a request
to get him out of those chains?

157
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:00,868
I'll take care of it.

158
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:04,408
I'm an attorney.
May I see the charging document?

159
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:08,672
- We call it a charge sheet.
- Fabulous. May I see it?

160
00:20:09,784 --> 00:20:13,379
- Can you give me the basics?
- Article 85, desertion.

161
00:20:13,721 --> 00:20:17,851
Article 90, willfully disobeying
a superior officer...

162
00:20:18,026 --> 00:20:19,994
Murder? Nine...

163
00:20:20,295 --> 00:20:24,891
Yes. If convicted,
he'll get the death penalty.

164
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,901
Who's prosecuting?

165
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,667
Major Lucas Waldron has been
detailed as trial counsel.

166
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:38,378
- He any good?
- The best.

167
00:20:39,314 --> 00:20:42,579
- How about you?
- I do okay.

168
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:47,412
- Have you ever won a case?
- No.

169
00:20:54,662 --> 00:20:58,428
I'm going to defend you.
I know you didn't kill 9 people.

170
00:20:58,766 --> 00:21:01,098
- Mrs. Ikubik...
- I don't want you involved.

171
00:21:01,336 --> 00:21:05,568
- I'm already involved.
- Military law is not the same...

172
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:10,267
I'll learn. We're gonna
fight them, okay? Together.

173
00:21:17,018 --> 00:21:20,283
You remember those
three American kids?

174
00:21:20,588 --> 00:21:24,581
Students Who Were killed in that cafe
in El Salvador in '88.

175
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:26,690
Not in the camera, man.

176
00:21:26,894 --> 00:21:30,489
It Was a little toWn called Monte Azul.

177
00:21:30,765 --> 00:21:35,668
A member of a rebel group threW
a satchel bomb into that cafe.

178
00:21:37,905 --> 00:21:41,341
- Press had a field day.
- Right. Everybody went nuts.

179
00:21:41,643 --> 00:21:46,979
So they call up my unit, Detachment 27,
to locate the rebel leader.

180
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:51,614
- A terrorist named Danilo Chacon.
- And your orders came from...?

181
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:55,289
Our C.O. At Camp Lejeune, Bill Marks.
Anyways...

182
00:21:55,556 --> 00:21:58,889
Wait. I'm sorry.
Brigadier General Marks?

183
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:02,094
Representative to
the Congressional Committee...

184
00:22:02,397 --> 00:22:05,025
...on Military Appropriations.
Bill Marks?

185
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,669
Yes. He was
Colonel Bill Marks back then.

186
00:22:09,904 --> 00:22:16,173
Under his orders, we were sent in to
a little village called Las Colinas.

187
00:22:16,444 --> 00:22:20,972
It's not even a village, even.
Just some fields, a feW huts.

188
00:22:26,754 --> 00:22:31,885
Danilo Chacon was supposed
to be hiding out there and...

189
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,861
It was supposed to be routine.

190
00:22:46,474 --> 00:22:49,534
But somebody lost it.

191
00:22:50,144 --> 00:22:52,339
I hear a gun fire.

192
00:22:52,613 --> 00:22:59,177
By the time I get to the other end of
the village, 9 people are slaughtered.

193
00:23:00,455 --> 00:23:06,883
I'm just standing there. Old women,
men, kids, just dead, and I lost it.

194
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:10,064
I jumped the guy who did it.

195
00:23:10,365 --> 00:23:14,734
And next thing I know, I'm looking
at first-degree, nine specs.

196
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:20,897
- Who did it?
- Hernandez. Jimmy Hernandez.

197
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:26,474
He ordered me to keep my mouth shut.
Said Marks Would back him up.

198
00:23:26,748 --> 00:23:32,084
- I told him to go to hell.
- Major Hernandez, Marks' top aide?

199
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:38,051
He introduced himself to me
yesterday in the waiting area.

200
00:23:38,393 --> 00:23:39,951
What?

201
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:50,125
Claire, listen.
I want you to stay away from him.

202
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:53,872
He's extremely dangerous,
do you understand?

203
00:23:54,108 --> 00:23:59,410
So General Marks... See, he's like
the most decorated, most powerful...

204
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:06,986
And you're saying you were framed
by General Marks and his assistant?

205
00:24:07,455 --> 00:24:10,424
That's our defense?

206
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:12,524
Yep.

207
00:24:22,703 --> 00:24:28,073
I'm not looking forward to the firm's
name being remotely connected to this.

208
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:32,209
As it stands now, nobody knows
Ron Chapman is Tom Ikubik.

209
00:24:32,547 --> 00:24:35,516
- My husband's innocent.
- I'm sure he is.

210
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,709
I'm not interested in seeing
his name associated with murder.

211
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:45,891
I just want you to understand all
the possible, unforeseen consequences.

212
00:24:46,127 --> 00:24:52,362
I'll make it easy for you. If the firm
gets dragged into this, I'll resign.

213
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,669
Josh, remember that thing from the...?

214
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,939
- Thank you.
- Claire, can I do anything?

215
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:03,337
Yeah. I need a lawyer.
Somebody from the Marine Corps.

216
00:25:03,578 --> 00:25:05,739
Somebody who can beat them.

217
00:25:06,013 --> 00:25:07,981
Where will you be?

218
00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:09,371
Bill. Bill. William.

219
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:19,518
I'm looking for a Charlie Grimes.

220
00:26:20,354 --> 00:26:24,757
Don't tell me you need a lawyer,
because you are one.

221
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:29,726
I followed the Norris case.
Talk about a rabbit out of a hat.

222
00:26:29,997 --> 00:26:31,862
Are you Charles W. Grimes?

223
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:36,798
You can't get over my decorator, can
you? Welcome to Grimes & Associate.

224
00:26:37,104 --> 00:26:38,901
Associate?

225
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,131
Delilah?

226
00:26:43,077 --> 00:26:48,242
Rumor has it you're a good attorney.
Formerly of the J.A.G. Corps.

227
00:26:48,516 --> 00:26:49,813
In another life.

228
00:26:50,117 --> 00:26:53,575
You had an affair with
your superior officer's wife...

229
00:26:53,854 --> 00:26:57,449
Let's not dwell on my youthful
offenses. What do you want?

230
00:26:57,692 --> 00:27:00,092
The military set up my husband...

231
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:03,627
...and assigned a junior varsity
lieutenant to defend him.

232
00:27:03,864 --> 00:27:07,265
- Who's prosecuting?
- Waldron.

233
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,735
He should cop a plea.
Try to make a deal.

234
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:18,410
Military justice is to justice as
military music is to music. Wake up.

235
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:23,241
Charlie, you're not gonna believe
this. They busted me again.

236
00:27:23,584 --> 00:27:29,181
It's like every time I turn around,
they slap handcuffs on me.

237
00:27:29,423 --> 00:27:34,486
Every time you turn around,
you've got some private's privates.

238
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:37,858
I perform an important service
for the military.

239
00:27:38,132 --> 00:27:39,997
There's a novel defense.

240
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:44,465
- You do somebody at the base too?
- Yeah, actually.

241
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:50,035
- Is your lawyer here any good?
- When he gets off his ass, yeah.

242
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:53,643
How about it, Mr. Grimes?

243
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:56,975
- Man, turn this shit off.
- Nice to meet you.

244
00:27:57,251 --> 00:27:59,845
- I'm due in court in an hour.
- An hour!

245
00:28:18,673 --> 00:28:19,970
Jackie.

246
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:25,042
I'm here to help,
'cause what are sisters for?

247
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,745
Wow. Tacky.

248
00:28:30,351 --> 00:28:34,720
You got evicted, didn't you?
What happened to the money I sent?

249
00:28:34,955 --> 00:28:38,254
Too little, too late.
I need an extra phone line.

250
00:28:38,492 --> 00:28:42,394
- What for?
- My new job. Psychic hotline.

251
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:46,063
Don't laugh. I'm really good at it.

252
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:12,755
It's 29 past the hour
if you're on your Way to Work.

253
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,418
OtherWise kick back,
I got you covered.

254
00:29:16,764 --> 00:29:18,664
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

255
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:21,900
I'm gonna kill that goddamn clock.

256
00:29:23,504 --> 00:29:25,369
- Hey, GI Joe.
- Ma'am.

257
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:29,735
Ma'am? Claire, did you hear that?
He just called me "ma'am."

258
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:34,276
- Shall we?
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

259
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:39,409
I don't need security clearance
for the pretrial?

260
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:42,315
The only portions
that are classified...

261
00:29:42,556 --> 00:29:46,287
...are those pertaining
to the incidents in El Salvador.

262
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:51,461
You know, I hope
she didn't think I was staring.

263
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:53,767
- Who?
- Well, your sister.

264
00:29:54,068 --> 00:29:58,835
Oh, don't worry about it.
She understands. She's psychic.

265
00:30:02,977 --> 00:30:07,346
Well, what do you know?
Mr. Grimes has decided to join us.

266
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:13,176
You do know that Charlie Grimes
has a history of being a major drunk?

267
00:30:21,295 --> 00:30:24,662
Are you sober, Mr. Grimes?

268
00:30:25,232 --> 00:30:30,864
Four hundred and sixty-two days,
Mrs. Ikubik. Ain't life grand?

269
00:30:31,071 --> 00:30:33,938
- Fill me in.
- Pretrial hearing is in 10.

270
00:30:34,241 --> 00:30:37,267
- Ten what?
- Minutes.

271
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:41,010
What?

272
00:30:43,484 --> 00:30:46,920
You don't think
they'll be impressed with leather?

273
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:55,320
- Who's the judge?
- Colonel Farrell.

274
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:57,622
It would be.

275
00:30:58,365 --> 00:31:01,892
Full-bird colonel
at his terminal rank.

276
00:31:02,303 --> 00:31:05,067
He'll piss on us
because we're civilians.

277
00:31:05,306 --> 00:31:09,936
And he won't give a shit about
reversals because he's retiring.

278
00:31:10,144 --> 00:31:11,543
File any motions?

279
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:14,543
Dismissal of charges,
insufficient evidence.

280
00:31:14,782 --> 00:31:17,046
- Motion denied.
- You haven't read it.

281
00:31:17,318 --> 00:31:22,085
Neither has Farrell. The military
judicial system is based on denial.

282
00:31:22,323 --> 00:31:25,224
- Then we fight the system.
- No, no, no, no.

283
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:28,589
You play by the rules.
Do not fight the system.

284
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:33,332
You fight the system, you lose.
Isn't that right, Embry?

285
00:31:33,634 --> 00:31:35,067
Say, "Yes, sir."

286
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:39,931
Don't be a sap, Embry. Nobody
in a uniform can think for himself.

287
00:31:40,207 --> 00:31:44,837
This is a pretrial hearing.
The goal is to not reveal anything.

288
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:48,081
Do we have anything
to reveal, Mrs. Ikubik?

289
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:51,941
- No.
- No? Then that ought to work.

290
00:32:03,898 --> 00:32:08,028
- Which one's the prosecutor?
- We call them trial counsels.

291
00:32:08,335 --> 00:32:11,862
- Mrs. Ikubik, I'm Major Waldron.
- How do you do?

292
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:14,134
Hi, Lucas.

293
00:32:14,508 --> 00:32:18,274
- Charlie Grimes. Nice to see you.
- Bullshit.

294
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,147
All rise.

295
00:32:28,722 --> 00:32:33,989
Be seated. This article 39A
session is called to order.

296
00:32:34,295 --> 00:32:37,458
I'm Colonel Farrell,
U.S. Marine Corps.

297
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:40,699
Where the hell's the accused?

298
00:32:56,216 --> 00:32:58,514
Charlie Grimes.

299
00:32:58,786 --> 00:33:01,311
I'll explain later.

300
00:33:06,327 --> 00:33:08,818
Sergeant Chapman, how do you plead?

301
00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:12,860
We have a motion
to have all charges dismissed.

302
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,967
Motion denied. In the court-martial
system, we don't have clients.

303
00:33:18,272 --> 00:33:23,141
Sergeant Ron Chapman is the accused,
and I'm still waiting for the plea.

304
00:33:24,111 --> 00:33:27,478
I plead not guilty.
Not guilty.

305
00:33:27,748 --> 00:33:29,648
You may be seated.

306
00:33:30,117 --> 00:33:33,018
We request a ruling
on the permissibility...

307
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,346
...of the accused being
represented by his spouse.

308
00:33:36,623 --> 00:33:38,454
- Your Honor...
- I'll allow it.

309
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:40,557
Thank you, Your Honor.

310
00:33:40,861 --> 00:33:44,353
We request a short pretrial period
to ensure security.

311
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:47,293
Granted.
Opening statements are in a week.

312
00:33:47,601 --> 00:33:52,300
Objection. We can't prepare a defense
for a capital case in one week.

313
00:33:52,606 --> 00:33:54,699
Overruled. Are we done?

314
00:33:55,042 --> 00:33:59,342
We have no intention of
waiving our right to a public trial...

315
00:33:59,646 --> 00:34:01,978
...as guaranteed
by the Sixth Amendment.

316
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:05,047
This case involves national security.

317
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:10,517
Any attempt to try this case in the
media would violate this court's order.

318
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:14,557
As civilians, we are not subject
to military orders.

319
00:34:14,828 --> 00:34:19,060
Any such orders will be taken
for informational purposes only.

320
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:20,766
Civilian or not...

321
00:34:21,035 --> 00:34:25,233
...you can be disqualified
from participating in this trial.

322
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:27,832
All rise.

323
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:40,686
And so it begins. See you soon.

324
00:34:41,722 --> 00:34:43,622
He's supposed to be the best.

325
00:34:47,594 --> 00:34:49,994
What the hell was that?

326
00:34:50,197 --> 00:34:53,860
I said you should follow the rules.
I'm the wild card.

327
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:57,295
- We could get thrown off the case.
- It's too early.

328
00:34:57,504 --> 00:35:01,941
If they think we'll go public,
we get an idea how scared they are.

329
00:35:02,209 --> 00:35:03,540
What do you think?

330
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:08,044
I think, why me?
Why was I assigned to this case?

331
00:35:10,217 --> 00:35:14,551
Seven guys in Tom's unit,
and all of them say he did it.

332
00:35:14,755 --> 00:35:17,622
But only two witnesses
are on their list.

333
00:35:17,858 --> 00:35:20,292
Hernandez and Abbott.
What about the rest?

334
00:35:20,594 --> 00:35:22,152
Dead.

335
00:35:22,663 --> 00:35:25,723
- All of them?
- Dead how?

336
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:29,901
Two were killed in combat.
One was murdered...

337
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:33,637
...and the other two, accidents.

338
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:35,331
Accidents?

339
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:39,074
I know a couple PI's.
Ex-Green Berets.

340
00:35:39,379 --> 00:35:44,715
Maybe they could get us the unofficial
version of how these guys died.

341
00:35:45,919 --> 00:35:47,910
Could be useful.

342
00:35:48,222 --> 00:35:50,986
Here we go.
Troy Abbott in Sacramento.

343
00:35:51,258 --> 00:35:54,489
Doing four to six in Lompoc,
armed robbery.

344
00:35:54,761 --> 00:35:58,822
And Waldron's office is trying
to expedite his parole.

345
00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:01,159
Why do I know he'll succeed?

346
00:36:01,635 --> 00:36:04,832
Because it's the Marines.
"Be all you can be."

347
00:36:05,072 --> 00:36:06,505
That's the Army.

348
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:12,007
Mrs. Ikubik, I really think our theory
should be that Hernandez acted alone.

349
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:15,610
No one's gonna believe
Marks was in on this.

350
00:36:15,782 --> 00:36:19,343
In other words, you don't believe it.

351
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:24,514
- That's not my point.
- Do you believe Tom or not?

352
00:36:24,758 --> 00:36:27,591
Easy. He's just
expressing his opinion.

353
00:36:27,794 --> 00:36:30,354
Shouldn't you be somewhere else?

354
00:36:30,664 --> 00:36:32,495
Not really.

355
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:38,637
- Can I get you another coffee, sir?
- No, ma'am. I'm good.

356
00:36:46,213 --> 00:36:49,512
I'll have to agree with Embry.
I like Marks.

357
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:55,450
Smells, looks, tastes credible.
He'll just give Hernandez credibility.

358
00:36:56,056 --> 00:37:00,254
- That's what I'm saying.
- He's had an original thought.

359
00:37:01,061 --> 00:37:03,291
- You know what?
- Is that my line?

360
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:05,758
- Go to hell.
- Another one.

361
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:12,131
- Can you hold for Major Waldron?
- Yes, I'll hold for Major Waldron.

362
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:15,237
- Hello, Mrs. Kubik.
- Hello, major.

363
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:19,706
Come doWn to my office.
We'll try to Work something out.

364
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,039
We'll be there.

365
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:28,110
I can't believe it. They want a deal.

366
00:37:28,388 --> 00:37:31,289
I love being a wild card.

367
00:37:32,226 --> 00:37:36,720
Mr. Ikubik, voluntary manslaughter,
only one specification.

368
00:37:36,997 --> 00:37:38,760
That's only five years.

369
00:37:38,999 --> 00:37:42,958
Plus one condition that you sign
a nondisclosure agreement?

370
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,238
As your counsel...

371
00:37:45,439 --> 00:37:49,398
Claire, tell the man to take
the deal of the century.

372
00:37:49,676 --> 00:37:50,802
Sweetheart?

373
00:37:51,111 --> 00:37:55,445
I won't do five minutes
for a crime I didn't commit.

374
00:37:55,749 --> 00:37:57,239
Do you have any idea...

375
00:37:57,517 --> 00:38:03,114
...what it's like to spend
23 hours a day in a 6-by-8 cell?

376
00:38:03,357 --> 00:38:08,090
Five years. They'll make sure
I'm dead long before that.

377
00:38:09,363 --> 00:38:12,890
So motion denied?

378
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:26,942
Come on in. Based on our...

379
00:38:27,247 --> 00:38:31,650
That's all right. We're here
to tell you we're gonna pass.

380
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:33,613
Thanks anyway.

381
00:38:36,957 --> 00:38:39,152
Mrs. Ikubik.

382
00:38:40,027 --> 00:38:42,825
I'm happy to go
to trial with this case.

383
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:48,498
Putting this behind us works for
everyone. Command and your husband.

384
00:38:48,735 --> 00:38:54,605
And Major Hernandez and General Marks.
See you in court, sir.

385
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:02,174
- Here on the Fantasy Jewelry Hour.
- I'd expect to pay $ 199 for this.

386
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:06,580
Yes, you Would.
This beautiful piece is available...

387
00:39:06,853 --> 00:39:12,883
So no deal. Can you believe I asked
my husband to do five years in prison?

388
00:39:13,093 --> 00:39:18,725
Go ahead. Tell me what a waste
of oxygen all lawyers are.

389
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:22,467
If you're on the phone noW,
don't get off the line.

390
00:39:22,703 --> 00:39:25,797
- That's right.
- You Won't Want to miss this.

391
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:29,873
You're curiously quiet on the subject.

392
00:39:32,479 --> 00:39:35,744
Jackie, would you please
turn that down?

393
00:39:42,823 --> 00:39:47,453
Your husband came to my village
and killed my family. And it's true:

394
00:39:47,728 --> 00:39:51,391
Lawyers are a waste of oxygen.
Drop this deal...

395
00:39:51,665 --> 00:39:55,226
Excuse me? Mrs. Ikubik.

396
00:40:08,348 --> 00:40:10,475
He ran out.

397
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:14,345
Claire. Claire, are you okay?

398
00:40:19,259 --> 00:40:21,124
Bastards!

399
00:40:21,395 --> 00:40:25,126
It's Hernandez. Oh, goddamn.

400
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:29,094
We turned down their deal,
and he's trying to scare us.

401
00:40:29,336 --> 00:40:31,236
You don't know how they work.

402
00:40:31,505 --> 00:40:36,465
- I don't know how any of it works.
- What do you mean?

403
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:40,837
- This other life of yours.
- You don't believe me, do you?

404
00:40:41,114 --> 00:40:45,949
- Of course I believe you.
- Baby, I'll take a polygraph.

405
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,947
No need.
It's not admissible in court.

406
00:40:49,222 --> 00:40:53,181
The hell with the courts.
I want to do it for us.

407
00:40:55,462 --> 00:40:59,455
Hey, Ronnie. Or Tommy or whatever.
You haven't changed.

408
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,099
- This is an unethical ex parte.
- I'm here to help.

409
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:07,204
- What are you doing here?
- You ought to plead this out.

410
00:41:08,575 --> 00:41:11,169
Stop it! Stop!

411
00:41:11,478 --> 00:41:13,446
You're making it worse!

412
00:41:20,053 --> 00:41:24,513
Who let him in here?
He is not authorized to be in here!

413
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:27,122
- He is provoking my client!
- Look at your killer!

414
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,921
Who let him in?
He's not supposed to be in here!

415
00:41:31,231 --> 00:41:34,530
- He said he was a defense witness.
- He is not!

416
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:39,635
Who is in charge? I want to talk
to whoever is in charge.

417
00:41:43,677 --> 00:41:47,636
- Is your real name Ron Chapman?
- Yes.

418
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:53,648
Regarding the incident
at Las Colinas on March 15, 1988...

419
00:41:53,854 --> 00:41:56,914
...will you answer
my questions truthfully?

420
00:41:57,123 --> 00:42:00,422
Did you participate
in the death of anyone...

421
00:42:00,627 --> 00:42:03,790
...during the March 15,
1988 shootings?

422
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:16,168
Mrs. Ikubik?

423
00:42:24,484 --> 00:42:28,181
- You passed.
- Of course I passed.

424
00:42:35,829 --> 00:42:40,698
- Are we being monitored?
- No, it's absolutely secure.

425
00:42:41,067 --> 00:42:43,695
Absolutely secure?

426
00:42:44,304 --> 00:42:46,704
What do you mean?

427
00:42:47,474 --> 00:42:50,204
What do you think I mean?

428
00:43:15,201 --> 00:43:18,432
And lieutenant colonel...

429
00:43:18,772 --> 00:43:23,209
...were there any eyewitnesses
to this massacre?

430
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:27,640
Yes. We had seven eyewitness
statements, all I.D. Ing Chapman.

431
00:43:28,248 --> 00:43:29,613
Thank you.

432
00:43:30,116 --> 00:43:32,914
Nothing further, Your Honor.

433
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:48,532
Colonel LaPierre, you were
and still are a special agent with...

434
00:43:48,802 --> 00:43:53,466
...the criminal investigations division
in charge of this investigation?

435
00:43:53,707 --> 00:43:55,106
That's correct.

436
00:43:55,408 --> 00:43:58,969
So when you say the investigation
was not flawed...

437
00:43:59,212 --> 00:44:02,579
...you're giving yourself
a big thumbs up.

438
00:44:02,749 --> 00:44:06,776
- I'm just expressing my opinion.
- So help you God, no doubt.

439
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:11,423
Now, is it possible, colonel,
that these so-called witnesses...

440
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:14,558
...were coached before
you talked to them?

441
00:44:14,828 --> 00:44:18,320
I guess it's possible, but unlikely.

442
00:44:18,632 --> 00:44:21,760
Are you aware that
of the seven witnesses...

443
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:24,868
...two were subsequently
killed in combat?

444
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:26,536
I'm aware of that.

445
00:44:26,773 --> 00:44:32,473
And another three, three relatively
young men, have died as well?

446
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:35,545
- Yes.
- Let's see.

447
00:44:35,782 --> 00:44:39,650
There was a Lt. Allen
of Longview, Texas. Hit-and-run.

448
00:44:39,919 --> 00:44:45,118
A Sgt. Stenstrom of Taos, New Mexico.
Accidental drowning.

449
00:44:45,392 --> 00:44:49,226
The other, an unfortunate
mountain climbing fall.

450
00:44:49,529 --> 00:44:51,997
- That sounds right.
- Does it?

451
00:44:52,265 --> 00:44:54,825
Well, that's interesting, colonel...

452
00:44:55,101 --> 00:44:58,969
...seeing as how I just made up
those causes of death.

453
00:44:59,305 --> 00:45:05,835
There was no accidental drowning
and no mountain climbing fall.

454
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,107
I have the details of these deaths,
including a home-invasion robbery...

455
00:45:11,451 --> 00:45:13,646
...if you care to look at them.

456
00:45:14,287 --> 00:45:18,690
I'm fuzzy on the details.
I didn't lead those investigations.

457
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:20,825
No further questions.

458
00:45:21,061 --> 00:45:24,224
- My investigation was...
- No further questions.

459
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,494
Hello?

460
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:32,568
You knoW the Witness
in Tom's unit Who Was murdered?

461
00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:37,037
- Home-invasion robbery.
- He Was killed in front of his Wife.

462
00:45:37,343 --> 00:45:41,575
The Word is, she accused the military
of having been involved.

463
00:45:41,815 --> 00:45:43,407
Will she talk to us?

464
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:47,811
Problem there is that
she disappeared right after that.

465
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:08,706
- Is this a bad time?
- Bad time? No.

466
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:11,569
We could go over the Hernandez cross.

467
00:46:11,845 --> 00:46:14,279
I was taking a break...

468
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:19,516
...because I was going over
the Hernandez stuff myself, and...

469
00:46:20,887 --> 00:46:24,084
Don't be mad.
It wasn't him. It was all me.

470
00:46:24,357 --> 00:46:30,956
This doesn't affect anything, okay?
My work. I'm totally up for it.

471
00:46:31,631 --> 00:46:36,193
He is. Come on, Claire.
We were just going over his briefs.

472
00:46:38,872 --> 00:46:43,332
- Claire, wait.
- You never take anything seriously.

473
00:46:43,643 --> 00:46:45,338
Oh, yeah. That's right.

474
00:46:45,645 --> 00:46:49,445
You get to be the lawyer,
so I gotta get to bang one, right?

475
00:47:31,591 --> 00:47:32,853
Closed.

476
00:47:33,092 --> 00:47:35,151
We're closed!

477
00:47:39,332 --> 00:47:41,527
- Sorry, we're closed.
- Excuse me.

478
00:47:41,835 --> 00:47:45,396
- How do I get to State Street?
- Two blocks down.

479
00:47:45,705 --> 00:47:48,333
- Thank you.
- Sorry.

480
00:48:04,224 --> 00:48:06,488
Want some cheese?

481
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,661
- Yeah, I could make an omelette.
- I'll make one.

482
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:15,731
- You want cheddar? American? Swiss?
- Cheddar's good.

483
00:48:16,002 --> 00:48:18,163
Mrs. Chapman?

484
00:48:20,406 --> 00:48:21,737
It's Ikubik.

485
00:48:21,975 --> 00:48:25,206
I wanna tell you about
what I do for a living.

486
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:30,141
This sicko bothering you? Because
I know how to deal with weirdos.

487
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:33,283
I teach guys to beat the box.

488
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,914
Who are you?

489
00:48:35,154 --> 00:48:39,181
I teach techniques enabling
anyone to beat a polygraph.

490
00:48:39,459 --> 00:48:44,692
Like special operations personnel that
might be captured and interrogated.

491
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:48,832
Basically, I teach people
to create a new persona.

492
00:48:49,102 --> 00:48:53,596
That way, when they lie,
they're not really lying.

493
00:48:54,507 --> 00:48:59,240
- Why are you telling me this?
- I don't know. But my guess is you do.

494
00:48:59,545 --> 00:49:01,513
Who are you? Who sent you?

495
00:49:01,781 --> 00:49:07,151
I was asked to convey this message.
So you know, along with everyone else.

496
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:11,355
- Good night, Mrs. Ikubik.
- Yeah, get out of here.

497
00:49:21,501 --> 00:49:23,298
Hey, honey.

498
00:49:23,569 --> 00:49:27,164
- Is it true?
- What?

499
00:49:27,473 --> 00:49:31,136
That you get that kind of training
to beat the box?

500
00:49:31,477 --> 00:49:34,708
- What are you talking about?
- The polygraph, Tom.

501
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:39,511
Sure, but I didn't beat the box.
I told the truth.

502
00:49:39,819 --> 00:49:44,153
- Why didn't you say you could do that?
- It didn't occur to me.

503
00:49:44,457 --> 00:49:50,885
- It's not a part of who I am anymore.
- That's it. How do I know who you are?

504
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:55,998
Claire, you're the only one
who knows who I am.

505
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:05,142
You know what? That's it. I...

506
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,141
I don't care anymore.

507
00:50:11,451 --> 00:50:15,251
I did it. I shot them all. Yeah.

508
00:50:15,555 --> 00:50:19,184
For the fun of it. Why not?
Who the hell cares?

509
00:50:19,425 --> 00:50:25,227
The man you've woken up to every day
just loves to kill women and children.

510
00:50:25,531 --> 00:50:29,058
In cold blood. Because l...

511
00:50:29,369 --> 00:50:34,534
Who the hell knows why, Claire?
Am I making any sense?

512
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:38,942
Does what I'm saying
make any sense to you?

513
00:50:39,612 --> 00:50:41,204
No.

514
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:56,224
I'm scared.

515
00:50:57,964 --> 00:51:00,592
This whole base ain't secure.

516
00:51:02,301 --> 00:51:04,997
They know every move we make.

517
00:51:12,745 --> 00:51:16,738
Tell me. How do they know, Charlie?
How do they know?

518
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:19,575
Good question, Mrs. Kubik.

519
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:57,319
- Damn! Charlie Grimes.
- Hey, Renny.

520
00:51:57,623 --> 00:51:59,818
It's been ages.

521
00:52:01,094 --> 00:52:06,498
- Did you come to beg for leftovers?
- I just wanna look through your trash.

522
00:52:06,799 --> 00:52:08,391
Okay?

523
00:53:16,102 --> 00:53:20,129
What's the problem? Take it easy.
Goddamn.

524
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:30,712
Hold his legs. Hold him.

525
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:33,111
No, no! Please!

526
00:53:35,321 --> 00:53:37,448
Come on. Come on.

527
00:53:41,561 --> 00:53:45,327
- I just don't believe it.
- My assistant used to say:

528
00:53:45,598 --> 00:53:47,998
"Truth is less fun than fiction."

529
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:52,067
- Terry wouldn't do that.
- You screw him, so you know him?

530
00:53:52,371 --> 00:53:56,239
- Excuse me, Mrs. Ron Chapman.
- I'm gonna sit down.

531
00:54:02,348 --> 00:54:04,908
- Well, well, well.
- What happened?

532
00:54:05,251 --> 00:54:08,584
Lucy, you got a lot
of explaining to do.

533
00:54:08,854 --> 00:54:11,322
Are you all right? Who did this?

534
00:54:11,591 --> 00:54:14,219
Just the old gang
from down at the club.

535
00:54:14,493 --> 00:54:19,658
- The ones that know every move we make.
- What are you talking about?

536
00:54:19,932 --> 00:54:23,390
How do they know about the polygraph?
Tarot cards?

537
00:54:23,669 --> 00:54:26,069
Were you drinking with Waldron?

538
00:54:26,372 --> 00:54:31,435
Every Friday, everybody drinks there.
We don't talk about cases.

539
00:54:31,677 --> 00:54:35,477
You were in the Corps.
You know what it's like, right?

540
00:54:36,115 --> 00:54:39,414
- You can understand.
- I understand you're fired.

541
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:44,418
This case will be over and you'll
be gone, but I'll still be here.

542
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:46,818
- Did you know about this?
- What?

543
00:54:47,193 --> 00:54:49,320
Did you know about the attack?

544
00:54:49,629 --> 00:54:54,396
- You just happened to show up then?
- Do you really think I would...?

545
00:55:12,084 --> 00:55:15,952
Let's go to the hospital.
I'm worried about your ribs.

546
00:55:16,322 --> 00:55:19,120
Just get me ice. I've been hit before.

547
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:25,729
I won't be there for Hernandez.
I got word. Troy Abbott got his parole.

548
00:55:25,998 --> 00:55:27,898
I gotta go track him down.

549
00:55:28,934 --> 00:55:31,095
Well, kind of sick.

550
00:55:31,837 --> 00:55:36,536
Chapman taunted the victims. He tossed
his gun around like a cowboy.

551
00:55:36,842 --> 00:55:41,108
IKind of showing off.
And then he executed them.

552
00:55:43,115 --> 00:55:45,481
Please continue, major.

553
00:55:46,352 --> 00:55:50,482
I ran to the south end of the village
but it was too late.

554
00:55:50,756 --> 00:55:54,658
They Were all dead.
Chapman Was still shooting.

555
00:55:57,330 --> 00:55:58,854
Get back!

556
00:55:59,932 --> 00:56:05,063
Two other unit members helped me.
We got him down. We got his weapon.

557
00:56:08,607 --> 00:56:12,373
Major, you say Sgt. Chapman
did some sick things.

558
00:56:12,645 --> 00:56:16,274
Yet you allowed him to proceed
without supervision?

559
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:19,210
I didn't know he'd take it that far.

560
00:56:19,485 --> 00:56:22,921
Had he been cited
for this kind of behavior before?

561
00:56:23,155 --> 00:56:24,349
No, he had not.

562
00:56:24,623 --> 00:56:28,650
Wasn't he your most experienced
and reliable member?

563
00:56:28,928 --> 00:56:32,591
Before you answer,
that's a quote from your report.

564
00:56:32,898 --> 00:56:36,800
- Defense Exhibit A.
- Chapman was a good Marine.

565
00:56:37,103 --> 00:56:40,072
- Courageous, honest.
- I thought so.

566
00:56:40,406 --> 00:56:44,467
The kind of Marine who
wouldn't go along with a cover-up...

567
00:56:44,744 --> 00:56:48,009
...for you, who committed the killing.
- Objection!

568
00:56:48,314 --> 00:56:51,977
Sustained. Make that your
last outburst, counselor.

569
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:56,846
Jury members, you are instructed
to disregard that accusation.

570
00:56:57,089 --> 00:57:01,253
How's it possible that seven men,
spread all over a village...

571
00:57:01,527 --> 00:57:03,893
...witnessed the exact same thing?

572
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:10,330
- We got to the barn at the same time.
- Wow. How convenient.

573
00:57:10,903 --> 00:57:16,637
Doesn't it make more sense that some
of the witnesses were ordered to lie?

574
00:57:16,942 --> 00:57:18,933
- They weren't.
- How do you know?

575
00:57:19,245 --> 00:57:21,236
I'd know if that happened.

576
00:57:21,514 --> 00:57:26,383
- And if that happened, you'd tell us.
- Of course. I wouldn't lie.

577
00:57:26,952 --> 00:57:32,788
But you're trained and compelled to
lie about your clandestine missions.

578
00:57:33,025 --> 00:57:37,257
As I understand it,
you're trained to beat a polygraph.

579
00:57:39,465 --> 00:57:42,127
Is it true you possess that talent?

580
00:57:42,435 --> 00:57:45,893
I'd only use it
if interrogated by the enemy.

581
00:57:46,205 --> 00:57:47,797
That's good to know.

582
00:57:48,407 --> 00:57:52,605
So tell me this, major.
Do you consider me a friend?

583
00:58:12,296 --> 00:58:16,892
I ain't done nothing. I didn't know
there'd be pimps involved.

584
00:58:17,201 --> 00:58:20,034
You got that all wrong. That ain't me.

585
00:58:20,405 --> 00:58:22,532
Shit, I should be so lucky.

586
00:58:22,775 --> 00:58:27,735
No, I'm just supposed to deliver
this to a Troy Abbott. That you?

587
00:58:28,047 --> 00:58:31,539
- Yeah. Who from?
- Jimmy Hernandez. Down at the base.

588
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:33,579
Hey, Charles.

589
00:58:33,853 --> 00:58:36,947
- What are you doing?
- Got a call from the base.

590
00:58:37,257 --> 00:58:39,248
- You got a call?
- Yeah.

591
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:44,622
- Bullshit. I got this call.
- What, bitch? Who you raising up to?

592
00:58:46,267 --> 00:58:49,236
- I'm tired of this bitch!
- Stop!

593
00:58:49,737 --> 00:58:53,696
- Why you always in trouble?
- Why you always playing daddy?

594
00:58:54,009 --> 00:58:57,911
- Apologize to the man.
- I ain't apologi...

595
00:59:01,483 --> 00:59:04,884
Do you want me to apologize, baby?

596
00:59:07,223 --> 00:59:08,781
Do you?

597
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,059
Gracie can apologize real good.

598
00:59:14,965 --> 00:59:16,557
Do you?

599
00:59:18,435 --> 00:59:21,097
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?

600
00:59:23,006 --> 00:59:24,735
So they paroled you?

601
00:59:25,009 --> 00:59:29,571
Yeah. And they bring me all the way
to this dump to testify.

602
00:59:29,848 --> 00:59:34,410
- What really happened down there?
- I don't know. It was years ago.

603
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,621
El Salvador, some massacre shit.

604
00:59:37,923 --> 00:59:41,586
I'll bet some damn officer
ordered it too.

605
00:59:43,362 --> 00:59:46,798
- You ain't thirsty?
- Oh, yeah. Shit, yeah.

606
00:59:47,067 --> 00:59:51,128
I'm just, you know, just chilling.

607
01:00:32,183 --> 01:00:35,675
- So then what did you say back?
- What did you say?

608
01:00:35,953 --> 01:00:39,616
- We never get to hear shit like that.
- Come on, Troy.

609
01:00:39,891 --> 01:00:44,521
Who are we gonna tell, you know
what I'm saying? What'd you say?

610
01:00:44,863 --> 01:00:47,297
That I was nowhere near the place.

611
01:00:47,567 --> 01:00:51,094
They wanted me to say
that I saw this guy shooting.

612
01:00:51,337 --> 01:00:54,033
- Damn.
- Yeah. That's intense.

613
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:57,832
- You gonna do it?
- I already did to the CID.

614
01:00:58,145 --> 01:01:01,342
I just gotta testify
to what I already said.

615
01:01:01,615 --> 01:01:06,211
- What's CID?
- Criminal Investigative Division.

616
01:01:06,587 --> 01:01:11,115
- Yeah, but what about this poor guy?
- Forget the poor guy.

617
01:01:11,426 --> 01:01:14,020
What are you gonna do? Your XO says:

618
01:01:14,262 --> 01:01:18,164
"You see Chapman shoot the wetbacks?"
You say, "I didn't."

619
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:22,960
He says, "Be sure about this.
Your career's on the line."

620
01:01:23,239 --> 01:01:27,039
Everybody else said he did it.
So I say what they want.

621
01:01:27,276 --> 01:01:30,803
One more witness,
no difference. Right?

622
01:01:31,948 --> 01:01:33,540
Right.

623
01:02:54,605 --> 01:02:58,939
- 911. Your address and emergency?
- Yes. 10145.

624
01:02:59,177 --> 01:03:03,807
- Is this an emergency?
- Someone's trying to get in the house.

625
01:03:04,116 --> 01:03:06,175
- Claire?
- Hello?

626
01:03:06,485 --> 01:03:09,818
- Come on. Open the door.
- It's okay. I'm sorry.

627
01:03:10,089 --> 01:03:14,048
- False alarm?
- Yeah, it was a false alarm. Thanks.

628
01:03:17,931 --> 01:03:20,422
Charlie, you scared me to death.

629
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,863
- That guy was out there.
- What guy?

630
01:03:24,372 --> 01:03:26,533
- You've been drinking.
- Who, me?

631
01:03:26,841 --> 01:03:29,605
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no. You got it wrong.

632
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:33,402
I'm just a victim
of hazardous working conditions.

633
01:03:33,749 --> 01:03:35,216
- Sure you are.
- Really!

634
01:03:35,484 --> 01:03:40,183
- That man was watching the house.
- No, ain't nobody out there.

635
01:03:43,426 --> 01:03:44,893
What is this?

636
01:03:45,161 --> 01:03:47,459
What is this?

637
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:50,164
Looks like a recorder.

638
01:03:51,234 --> 01:03:57,696
Is Abbott on here? Saying he never saw
what he agreed to testify to in court?

639
01:03:58,042 --> 01:04:02,035
- You didn't.
- I most certainly did. You know what?

640
01:04:02,313 --> 01:04:07,478
He was nowhere near the shooting.
I mean, nowhere near it.

641
01:04:09,354 --> 01:04:12,755
Charlie, this is fabulous.

642
01:04:13,059 --> 01:04:16,620
This does it.
This proves they're setting him up.

643
01:04:19,598 --> 01:04:21,429
Charlie, l...

644
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:28,398
You really think I wanted
to give up 483 days of sobriety?

645
01:04:28,708 --> 01:04:32,542
And start all over at day one, Claire?

646
01:04:37,652 --> 01:04:41,418
- I'll make some coffee.
- Wait a minute. Not so fast.

647
01:04:41,722 --> 01:04:45,249
See, I figure,
"You already slipped, Charlie.

648
01:04:45,527 --> 01:04:48,519
So, what's one more gonna hurt?"

649
01:04:48,797 --> 01:04:54,167
- How about it, Claire? One for us?
- I can't. I'm trying to get pregnant.

650
01:04:56,706 --> 01:05:01,268
Well, I'm not trying to get pregnant.

651
01:05:01,678 --> 01:05:05,273
I'm certainly not trying
to get pregnant.

652
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:14,954
But a judge will be...

653
01:05:25,371 --> 01:05:29,569
- You're late, counsel.
- Prosecution requests a sidebar.

654
01:05:29,876 --> 01:05:31,935
Make it good.

655
01:05:34,447 --> 01:05:37,814
- Our witness, Troy Abbott, is gone.
- What?

656
01:05:38,051 --> 01:05:41,851
- We've notified the MPs...
- My ass! You let him out of jail.

657
01:05:42,156 --> 01:05:46,149
We have a tape that impeaches
Abbott's original statement.

658
01:05:46,461 --> 01:05:48,895
- There's no discovery.
- You got spies...

659
01:05:49,164 --> 01:05:53,863
- In my chambers. Court is recessed.
- All rise.

660
01:05:59,708 --> 01:06:02,609
What are you gonna do? Your XO says:

661
01:06:02,878 --> 01:06:06,746
"You see Chapman shoot the Wetbacks?"
You say, "I didn't."

662
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:11,953
He says, "Be sure about this.
Your career's on the line."

663
01:06:12,255 --> 01:06:16,351
Everybody else said he did it.
So I say What they Want.

664
01:06:16,661 --> 01:06:20,153
One more Witness,
no difference. Right?

665
01:06:36,916 --> 01:06:39,441
We can't authenticate this tape.

666
01:06:39,752 --> 01:06:44,382
For all we know, he may have
been coerced. It's inadmissable.

667
01:06:44,691 --> 01:06:48,058
- What?
- You admitted Abbott's CID statement.

668
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:52,561
We need this to rebut it.
This tape exonerates Ron Chapman.

669
01:06:52,866 --> 01:06:55,334
The CID is an objective party.

670
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:59,970
Bullshit! He lied! They lied!
How the hell is that objective?

671
01:07:00,208 --> 01:07:04,110
- The tape is excluded. What's next?
- Your Honor!

672
01:07:04,446 --> 01:07:07,040
Excluded, counselor.

673
01:07:09,285 --> 01:07:10,809
Major.

674
01:07:11,988 --> 01:07:15,389
We're out of witnesses.
The prosecution rests.

675
01:07:15,691 --> 01:07:20,151
This is a capital case. An objective
judge would admit the tape!

676
01:07:20,397 --> 01:07:25,596
- We'll hear the defense next Friday.
- This is grounds for an appeal.

677
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:40,280
- Honey? We'll appeal this.
- Stop. You can't fight them.

678
01:07:40,552 --> 01:07:43,214
Don't say that. We'll get a break.

679
01:07:43,522 --> 01:07:48,755
You do not know these people.
Stop it before you get yourself hurt.

680
01:07:48,995 --> 01:07:53,523
We can win this! I am not gonna
let them do this to you!

681
01:08:03,544 --> 01:08:05,671
What are you doing?

682
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:12,513
Is that a...?

683
01:08:12,854 --> 01:08:16,688
Must have done it
when they installed the phones.

684
01:08:19,896 --> 01:08:25,266
And you two were so ready
to blame Terry. So self-righteous.

685
01:08:26,669 --> 01:08:30,435
- Go to Farrell. Demand a mistrial.
- Denied.

686
01:08:30,741 --> 01:08:34,939
There's no way to prove
Waldron or Hernandez did this.

687
01:08:35,212 --> 01:08:37,112
Then, what?

688
01:08:41,453 --> 01:08:46,891
- We are out of witnesses and time.
- Let's hear from the brigadier general.

689
01:08:47,158 --> 01:08:49,888
- Not on the stand.
- No.

690
01:08:50,161 --> 01:08:54,291
- You think we should pay him a visit?
- I think you should.

691
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,068
Why me? Are you scared of him?

692
01:08:59,405 --> 01:09:04,433
No, but I'm just a thorn in the
Marine Corps' ass.

693
01:09:05,412 --> 01:09:11,681
But you, my dear. You're the pretty,
young, sympathetic little wife.

694
01:09:12,954 --> 01:09:15,514
I don't play those games.

695
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:20,259
Shit.

696
01:09:22,831 --> 01:09:25,095
I was starting to think that...

697
01:09:33,877 --> 01:09:36,004
- General Marks?
- No press, please.

698
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:38,611
- I'm not press. How do you do?
- Ms...

699
01:09:38,948 --> 01:09:43,908
Ikubik. Claire Ikubik. I'm representing
my husband, Sgt. Ron Chapman.

700
01:09:44,455 --> 01:09:47,652
- Mrs. Ikubik. Good day.
- General Marks.

701
01:09:47,958 --> 01:09:51,257
- You gave James Hernandez the order...
- No comment.

702
01:09:51,529 --> 01:09:53,793
...to kill Chacon and his group.

703
01:09:54,132 --> 01:09:58,159
You knew they expected Detachment 27
to come under attack.

704
01:09:58,503 --> 01:10:00,971
You're a dignified man.
End the cover-up.

705
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:02,501
How dare you?

706
01:10:02,809 --> 01:10:06,370
Your man Hernandez overreacted
and opened fire.

707
01:10:06,679 --> 01:10:08,579
You are way out of line.

708
01:10:08,881 --> 01:10:12,282
Listen to this
and tell me how out of line I am.

709
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:33,906
If you Wanna talk to Charlie,
leave a message after the beep.

710
01:10:34,176 --> 01:10:37,907
If you Wanna talk to Delilah,
get your head examined.

711
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:41,707
The man flicked me off his suit
like I was a flea.

712
01:10:42,017 --> 01:10:46,477
I'm gonna lose my mind.
We can't let them get away with this.

713
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:52,524
There has to be somebody who
was there. There has to be somebody...

714
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:05,631
- Directory assistance.
- The Herald.

715
01:11:06,311 --> 01:11:11,010
Of course not. When you settle down,
I do have something to say.

716
01:11:11,283 --> 01:11:14,980
- Is your husband the...?
- Is there a military conspiracy?

717
01:11:15,488 --> 01:11:19,788
I cannot legally comment
on the details of a court-martial.

718
01:11:20,059 --> 01:11:23,859
I'd like to say emphatically
that my husband is innocent.

719
01:11:24,163 --> 01:11:28,259
There's a man Who is a stranger to me
Who said last Week...

720
01:11:28,536 --> 01:11:31,369
...that all laWyers
are a Waste of oxygen.

721
01:11:31,639 --> 01:11:36,702
As a Wife and an attorney, I fear
justice Won't ultimately be served.

722
01:11:36,978 --> 01:11:41,677
I'd like to challenge that man
or anyone With firsthand knoWledge...

723
01:11:41,950 --> 01:11:44,510
...of What happened to come forWard.

724
01:11:44,819 --> 01:11:48,516
To recap today's press conference
With Claire Kubik...

725
01:11:48,791 --> 01:11:52,557
...she's continually insisting
her husband is innocent.

726
01:11:52,828 --> 01:11:56,628
This attorney and Wife
is clearly standing by her man.

727
01:11:56,900 --> 01:12:00,631
Reporting live for
Channel 12 NeWs, this is...

728
01:12:28,034 --> 01:12:30,195
- Hello.
- You just had to do it.

729
01:12:30,503 --> 01:12:36,373
- The firm just saW you on the neWs.
- Hi, Alex, I've been expecting your...

730
01:12:38,613 --> 01:12:40,308
Claire.

731
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:43,681
I'll...

732
01:12:43,985 --> 01:12:48,752
You, um... I'll send you
my resignation tomorrow.

733
01:12:49,024 --> 01:12:50,753
Claire...

734
01:13:06,409 --> 01:13:08,240
Get in.

735
01:13:08,746 --> 01:13:10,077
No.

736
01:13:15,786 --> 01:13:18,482
Wait. Okay, wait.

737
01:13:33,773 --> 01:13:35,764
Where are we going?

738
01:13:41,548 --> 01:13:44,346
I wanna know the truth.

739
01:13:47,721 --> 01:13:51,213
I wanna know what happened
at Las Colinas.

740
01:14:01,403 --> 01:14:03,837
You don't care about the truth.

741
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:07,906
All you care about
is saving your husband.

742
01:14:46,018 --> 01:14:47,747
Get out.

743
01:14:49,055 --> 01:14:50,386
Get out.

744
01:15:02,804 --> 01:15:05,295
You want to know about Las Colinas?

745
01:15:06,407 --> 01:15:08,204
Women like you...

746
01:15:09,611 --> 01:15:10,805
...beautiful...

747
01:15:12,348 --> 01:15:14,009
...young...

748
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:22,723
...and the old people,
begging for their lives.

749
01:15:36,174 --> 01:15:38,642
Jesus Christ.

750
01:15:40,444 --> 01:15:43,845
It was 12 years ago.
They all look the same...

751
01:15:44,116 --> 01:15:47,176
- Don't be foolish!
- It's a photograph.

752
01:15:47,452 --> 01:15:51,548
I just want to show you a photograph.

753
01:16:04,038 --> 01:16:08,202
I remember him. The one
with the patch on his eye.

754
01:16:08,509 --> 01:16:12,502
The blood still fresh
from the explosion at Monte Azul.

755
01:16:12,781 --> 01:16:15,215
- He was at Monte Azul?
- Of course.

756
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:18,283
He killed Danilo Chacon.

757
01:16:18,887 --> 01:16:23,790
Chacon Was in the cafe in a secret
meeting, and this man Was there.

758
01:16:24,093 --> 01:16:26,425
He Was there.

759
01:16:28,397 --> 01:16:30,365
That's hoW he hurt his eye.

760
01:16:30,666 --> 01:16:34,067
Chacon blew up the cafe
and killed the Americans...

761
01:16:34,371 --> 01:16:36,339
You people believe anything!

762
01:16:36,607 --> 01:16:38,837
They Were killed by mistake...

763
01:16:39,109 --> 01:16:42,567
...because the military
didn't knoW they Were there.

764
01:16:42,913 --> 01:16:48,317
To cover it up, they blamed the rebels
and pretended to look for Chacon.

765
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:54,581
But they kneW he Was already dead,
that they had killed him With the bomb.

766
01:17:15,216 --> 01:17:18,276
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

767
01:17:42,078 --> 01:17:46,811
- Lf it isn't Little Miss 6:00 News.
- You're drunk.

768
01:17:47,084 --> 01:17:51,817
- You were supposed to call me when...
- Charlie?

769
01:17:52,089 --> 01:17:54,614
I called you.

770
01:17:55,592 --> 01:17:59,926
- I was out. You could've called back.
- We had an agreement.

771
01:18:00,532 --> 01:18:04,525
Excuse me. I thought
we had an agreement.

772
01:18:04,769 --> 01:18:07,499
I thought me and you was partners.

773
01:18:07,773 --> 01:18:10,503
- Partners don't do dumb shit...
- It worked.

774
01:18:10,843 --> 01:18:14,745
...without telling
the other part of the team.

775
01:18:15,047 --> 01:18:18,642
- What?
- I just spent an hour with the guy.

776
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:21,887
He's the real deal.
He saw the whole thing.

777
01:18:22,189 --> 01:18:24,657
Tom's innocent. This proves it.

778
01:18:25,425 --> 01:18:30,829
There's a cover-up and it's bigger
than we thought. I need you sober.

779
01:18:33,935 --> 01:18:35,402
- Come on.
- All right.

780
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:38,833
- Let's get you home.
- Okay, babe. All right.

781
01:18:39,108 --> 01:18:43,807
- No, Charlie.
- Chris, last one. Just one more.

782
01:18:44,113 --> 01:18:48,345
- Forget about it.
- I got it. I got it.

783
01:18:51,554 --> 01:18:53,579
Come on, partner.

784
01:18:59,296 --> 01:19:01,491
All right, partner.

785
01:19:30,831 --> 01:19:32,890
What the hell was that?

786
01:19:35,803 --> 01:19:38,169
What? Oh, my God!

787
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:44,105
Shit, it's oil!

788
01:20:32,365 --> 01:20:34,492
Hi, sweetie.

789
01:20:39,372 --> 01:20:42,864
Oh. I had the worst dream.

790
01:20:43,677 --> 01:20:48,808
I dreamt I was pregnant and these
people came and took the baby away.

791
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:51,415
You one lucky girl.

792
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,120
You and the gentleman.

793
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:58,491
I want you to take something.

794
01:21:08,971 --> 01:21:14,534
Don't you worry about a thing.
You'll have another baby.

795
01:21:17,114 --> 01:21:18,911
What?

796
01:21:19,850 --> 01:21:21,750
- Don't you worry.
- What?

797
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:24,545
You'll have another one.

798
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:28,691
Jackie?

799
01:21:30,828 --> 01:21:34,821
- No. No.
- I'm so sorry.

800
01:21:35,701 --> 01:21:39,137
That's not fair. No.

801
01:21:47,214 --> 01:21:51,878
Be strong. Be strong.
You have to rest.

802
01:22:06,101 --> 01:22:09,593
- Claire? It's Charlie.
- Come in.

803
01:22:13,476 --> 01:22:15,239
Hi.

804
01:22:21,985 --> 01:22:24,453
- How's your neck?
- It's all right.

805
01:22:24,788 --> 01:22:30,090
I've had worse whiplashes looking
at pretty women like you on the street.

806
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:35,463
I'm truly sorry, Claire.

807
01:22:39,271 --> 01:22:42,763
I wanted that baby so much, Charlie.

808
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:47,975
You know, I kept thinking...

809
01:22:49,015 --> 01:22:53,714
...maybe there was something wrong
with me or I didn't deserve it...

810
01:22:53,986 --> 01:22:56,420
...or I wouldn't be a good mother.

811
01:22:56,723 --> 01:23:00,955
I really didn't think
they'd do something like this.

812
01:23:01,495 --> 01:23:04,623
- I'm at zero, Charlie.
- Whoa, now.

813
01:23:04,899 --> 01:23:08,801
Listen to me. I know about zero.

814
01:23:09,103 --> 01:23:14,769
I've hit bottom, and I was on my way
back there before the accident.

815
01:23:15,044 --> 01:23:17,035
But you know what?

816
01:23:17,346 --> 01:23:22,374
I think we were spared for some reason
and you gotta believe that.

817
01:23:22,718 --> 01:23:27,712
So for me and you, kiddo,
this is day one.

818
01:23:27,957 --> 01:23:29,788
Okay?

819
01:23:32,996 --> 01:23:35,362
You got another visitor.

820
01:23:41,639 --> 01:23:43,664
Hello.

821
01:23:44,842 --> 01:23:49,506
Merry Christmas. You all right?

822
01:23:49,881 --> 01:23:53,044
I owe you an apology, lieutenant.

823
01:23:53,752 --> 01:23:56,846
- We were mistaken.
- That's okay.

824
01:23:57,123 --> 01:24:01,856
Although I'm not sure "merry"
is the right word to use around here.

825
01:24:02,128 --> 01:24:05,791
That's where you might
be wrong, Mrs. Ikubik.

826
01:24:06,433 --> 01:24:12,235
Had James Hernandez injured his eye in
the bombing, he'd have had treatment.

827
01:24:12,473 --> 01:24:16,466
There are covert operations
records for us to look up?

828
01:24:16,778 --> 01:24:19,747
No, he'd have insisted on it
for insurance...

829
01:24:19,981 --> 01:24:24,213
...so the government couldn't
screw him out of compensation.

830
01:24:35,931 --> 01:24:37,364
- Here.
- Thank you.

831
01:24:38,034 --> 01:24:40,195
Agent Mullins!

832
01:24:42,839 --> 01:24:45,865
I just need a minute of your time.

833
01:24:47,412 --> 01:24:51,075
Somehow I'm confident
it's not my rugged good looks...

834
01:24:51,416 --> 01:24:53,281
...to which I owe this visit.

835
01:24:53,551 --> 01:24:58,079
The press accepted the story.
What if Chacon didn't bomb the cafe?

836
01:24:58,357 --> 01:25:01,884
- Mrs. Ikubik...
- What if Hernandez, my husband's XO...

837
01:25:02,161 --> 01:25:05,756
...killed the American students
by mistake?

838
01:25:06,031 --> 01:25:10,730
What if Marks, to cover it up,
staged a raid on Las Colinas?

839
01:25:11,037 --> 01:25:13,665
What if all this is not my job?

840
01:25:13,973 --> 01:25:17,602
- Just help me look into it.
- Make it a lean one.

841
01:25:17,844 --> 01:25:20,278
Why not? You have your sources.

842
01:25:20,548 --> 01:25:23,642
- My sources?
- You say it's not your job.

843
01:25:23,951 --> 01:25:28,388
- I wasn't sure you were listening.
- Then whose job is it?

844
01:25:35,764 --> 01:25:38,232
Come on. Whose job?

845
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:42,766
Goddamn, what a pain
in the ass you are!

846
01:25:43,039 --> 01:25:45,940
Hernandez was injured
in the explosion.

847
01:25:46,242 --> 01:25:50,941
There's got to be a classified
medical document somewhere.

848
01:26:06,498 --> 01:26:08,466
- Charlie, it's me.
- Hey, Mac.

849
01:26:08,766 --> 01:26:12,827
I've been checking the rumors
about hoW the Witnesses died.

850
01:26:13,072 --> 01:26:17,304
I have expenses: Phone bills,
plane tickets. It'll cost you.

851
01:26:17,610 --> 01:26:21,512
- You told me that.
- I found the Wife of the murdered one.

852
01:26:21,815 --> 01:26:27,014
Lisa Stenstrom is in Mexico. She sWears
the military killed her husband.

853
01:26:27,254 --> 01:26:28,346
Oh, yeah?

854
01:26:28,922 --> 01:26:30,947
Just inside.

855
01:27:14,439 --> 01:27:16,600
- You hear from Charlie?
- He called.

856
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:19,639
But he didn't Want
to talk on the phone.

857
01:27:19,945 --> 01:27:23,437
Like him, I'm not sure
I should talk on the phone.

858
01:27:23,749 --> 01:27:27,810
- He did say he Was in Mexico.
- What is he doing in Mexico?

859
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:31,487
- I don't knoW. You coming back?
- I'm going to L.A.

860
01:27:31,724 --> 01:27:34,090
- So I'll see you.
- Bye.

861
01:27:47,742 --> 01:27:49,607
General.

862
01:27:50,044 --> 01:27:55,175
You all have had him all night.
It's my turn. Shall we?

863
01:27:59,088 --> 01:28:03,855
We uncovered the real reason
you sent Detachment 27 to Las Colinas.

864
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:07,391
- Uncovered? It's public record.
- Not really.

865
01:28:07,664 --> 01:28:12,795
It's a matter of record that Hernandez
injured his eye in Monte Azul.

866
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:16,938
He was seen in the truck
from which the grenade was thrown.

867
01:28:17,241 --> 01:28:21,871
He was treated at a hospital
in San Salvador before Las Colinas.

868
01:28:22,179 --> 01:28:26,445
Your gung-ho raid was
a decoy for your bombing.

869
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:30,210
This fairy tale of yours
would have to be based...

870
01:28:30,455 --> 01:28:35,188
...on classified material, even if
any of it were remotely possible.

871
01:28:35,461 --> 01:28:39,989
Now, you're bluffing.
And you're doing it badly.

872
01:28:42,368 --> 01:28:43,960
Thank you.

873
01:28:51,111 --> 01:28:55,377
We'd be only too happy
to have you testify under oath...

874
01:28:55,717 --> 01:28:59,551
...and allow the court
to fully explore our evidence.

875
01:28:59,788 --> 01:29:05,249
For example, classified document dated
3/14/88. Hernandez's medical report...

876
01:29:05,494 --> 01:29:08,622
...for a shrapnel wound
at Santa Maria Hospital.

877
01:29:08,931 --> 01:29:13,300
That's the same day
and mighty close to Monte Azul.

878
01:29:19,476 --> 01:29:24,709
You have no shame. Look what you're
willing to do to free a murderer.

879
01:29:24,981 --> 01:29:28,712
The charges get dropped
or the document goes public.

880
01:29:28,986 --> 01:29:33,719
Haven't you noticed
that you've been unlucky lately?

881
01:29:33,991 --> 01:29:37,722
Now, caution might be
the order of the day for you.

882
01:29:38,030 --> 01:29:40,225
I am not afraid of you.

883
01:29:40,466 --> 01:29:43,924
I've survived you once,
you smug son of a bitch.

884
01:29:44,269 --> 01:29:47,932
The real question is,
will you survive me?

885
01:29:48,141 --> 01:29:53,204
Make it go away, general,
or the document goes public.

886
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:02,018
For both our sakes, sir.

887
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:26,414
Pull over. Right here!

888
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:33,446
Jackie. Jackie?

889
01:30:42,233 --> 01:30:46,260
- Ma'am.
- Claire? You all right?

890
01:30:46,905 --> 01:30:49,305
Oh, my God. Yeah.

891
01:30:51,310 --> 01:30:52,902
What's that about?

892
01:30:53,212 --> 01:30:56,978
Colonel Farrell wants us
in court tomorrow at 0800.

893
01:30:57,216 --> 01:31:01,744
Waldron filed a motion to have you
disqualified from the case...

894
01:31:01,955 --> 01:31:03,980
...for talking to the press.

895
01:31:04,257 --> 01:31:06,020
Any word from Charlie?

896
01:31:06,259 --> 01:31:11,458
I've been trying his cell all day.
Just getting voice mail.

897
01:31:14,202 --> 01:31:18,104
We've still got
Hernandez's medical report.

898
01:31:18,607 --> 01:31:21,872
I'll... I'll do my best.

899
01:31:22,277 --> 01:31:27,874
Farrell wouldn't admit a classified
document any more than the Abbott tape.

900
01:31:28,718 --> 01:31:34,384
- Maybe you should take the deal.
- There's no more deal. Not now.

901
01:31:41,799 --> 01:31:46,099
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Ikubik.
- Why don't you spend the night out?

902
01:31:46,403 --> 01:31:50,362
I don't know if it's a good idea
to be here tonight.

903
01:31:56,014 --> 01:31:59,279
I could use a little time on my own.

904
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:33,252
- Hey. You heard from Charlie?
- No.

905
01:32:42,432 --> 01:32:46,562
- What's going on, honey?
- I don't know.

906
01:32:47,704 --> 01:32:50,138
All rise.

907
01:33:00,484 --> 01:33:02,179
Be seated.

908
01:33:05,457 --> 01:33:09,257
Major Waldron, Mrs. Ikubik,
please approach.

909
01:33:22,276 --> 01:33:23,641
What is this?

910
01:33:23,911 --> 01:33:28,814
For reasons of national security,
the Department of Defense decided...

911
01:33:29,116 --> 01:33:33,815
...the charges against
Sgt. Ron Chapman are to be withdrawn.

912
01:33:35,023 --> 01:33:39,016
Court is closed.
Sgt. Chapman, you're free to go.

913
01:33:39,894 --> 01:33:41,327
Oh, my God.

914
01:34:11,929 --> 01:34:15,592
Hey, Charlie. Listen,
in case you're interested, pal...

915
01:34:15,901 --> 01:34:17,698
...we won.

916
01:34:18,771 --> 01:34:21,865
We're going to Marin.
We're blowing this town.

917
01:34:22,107 --> 01:34:27,272
If you want to call, that's where
we'll be. Hope you're okay.

918
01:34:30,283 --> 01:34:32,183
Jesus, look at this.

919
01:34:36,657 --> 01:34:38,648
What do you suggest I do?

920
01:34:38,893 --> 01:34:43,330
Have Jackie meet us on the next block.
Will there be more at the airport?

921
01:34:43,564 --> 01:34:48,126
- Probably.
- Why bother? Let's just drive.

922
01:35:08,892 --> 01:35:10,484
Thank you.

923
01:35:10,727 --> 01:35:13,321
- You take care of yourself.
- You too.

924
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:15,359
Okay. Thanks, Jackie.

925
01:35:15,667 --> 01:35:20,297
- Well, kid, turns out you're okay.
- Well, you too, kid.

926
01:35:21,739 --> 01:35:24,640
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, lieutenant.

927
01:35:24,909 --> 01:35:27,104
We're gonna take our time.

928
01:35:27,346 --> 01:35:31,077
We'll call you when we get there.
Probably around 7?

929
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:33,910
- Bye.
- Bye.

930
01:35:47,068 --> 01:35:52,631
A week before Paul was murdered,
he called an old Marine Corps buddy...

931
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:57,004
...who, incidentally, was killed
about two months after Paul.

932
01:35:57,279 --> 01:36:01,340
I don't know what they talked about,
but it upset him.

933
01:36:03,252 --> 01:36:08,485
You have no idea what it's like to see
a loved one killed in front of you.

934
01:36:08,758 --> 01:36:11,727
You believe this is connected
to the military?

935
01:36:11,928 --> 01:36:13,225
Yeah.

936
01:36:14,364 --> 01:36:18,824
It's just a feeling, because
Paul knew him. You know?

937
01:36:19,136 --> 01:36:24,768
He just seemed to recognize him.
That thing he did with the hands.

938
01:36:25,042 --> 01:36:27,704
Paul seemed to know who he was.

939
01:36:32,284 --> 01:36:35,344
You think that owl's still around here?

940
01:36:37,690 --> 01:36:40,989
You know what bothered me
more than anything?

941
01:36:41,294 --> 01:36:43,626
I couldn't protect you.

942
01:36:43,863 --> 01:36:47,264
I had to stand by while they hurt you.

943
01:36:50,470 --> 01:36:53,496
I need more champagne.

944
01:36:56,777 --> 01:36:58,938
I love you.

945
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:02,381
I love you.

946
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:08,521
I thought you unplugged that.

947
01:37:08,824 --> 01:37:11,452
I did, but I tried Charlie
one more time.

948
01:37:11,794 --> 01:37:16,663
- Hi, Claire. It's me.
- Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

949
01:37:16,932 --> 01:37:19,457
- Look, I'm...
- I'll be right back.

950
01:37:19,769 --> 01:37:25,435
I'm sorry I Wasn't there today.
I didn't mean to let you doWn.

951
01:37:25,775 --> 01:37:27,504
Yeah, Charlie.

952
01:37:28,779 --> 01:37:32,909
Look, Claire. I'm real sorry.
I couldn't get there.

953
01:37:33,150 --> 01:37:38,178
Why today? Of all days. What if Marks
had opted to testify, or what...?

954
01:37:40,359 --> 01:37:43,487
You know what?
I don't want to talk about it.

955
01:37:44,029 --> 01:37:46,463
I thought I had a friend.

956
01:37:47,799 --> 01:37:49,289
I am your friend.

957
01:37:49,736 --> 01:37:51,795
Sure you are.

958
01:37:52,472 --> 01:37:55,305
Say a toast for my husband
while you drink.

959
01:37:55,675 --> 01:37:59,270
- Goodbye, Charlie.
- Listen. I am your friend.

960
01:37:59,512 --> 01:38:03,312
I was being your friend today.
More than you'd care to know.

961
01:38:03,951 --> 01:38:07,512
- What do you mean?
- We need to talk.

962
01:38:07,788 --> 01:38:11,019
I just don't think that
now's a good time for it.

963
01:38:11,559 --> 01:38:13,322
Where are you going?

964
01:38:13,662 --> 01:38:17,758
I think AA meetings are
supposed to be anonymous.

965
01:38:18,033 --> 01:38:20,797
- I'm gonna get more champagne.
- Hurry back.

966
01:38:25,941 --> 01:38:29,274
Are Marks and Hernandez
gonna give us trouble?

967
01:38:30,079 --> 01:38:32,809
- Tom still there?
- He's going to the store.

968
01:38:33,083 --> 01:38:36,780
All right, get to your computer.
Pull up your calendar.

969
01:38:38,055 --> 01:38:42,151
Find out Where your husband Was
on January 20, 1997.

970
01:38:42,393 --> 01:38:45,829
- Why are you doing this?
- Look it up. It's important.

971
01:38:52,338 --> 01:38:57,366
He was in Santa Fe. He met a collector.
I picked him up from the airport.

972
01:38:57,676 --> 01:39:00,577
February 10, '97.

973
01:39:07,554 --> 01:39:09,419
Houston, Texas. Trade show.

974
01:39:10,190 --> 01:39:15,253
Claire, listen to me. Those are the
dates that witnesses were murdered.

975
01:39:15,429 --> 01:39:20,264
Stenstrom Was murdered January 20, 1997
in Santa Fe, NeW Mexico.

976
01:39:20,568 --> 01:39:23,867
Allen died in Houston, Texas,
February 10.

977
01:39:24,139 --> 01:39:29,702
Hernandez said that Tom tossed his gun
back and forth, taunting his victims.

978
01:39:29,978 --> 01:39:32,879
- Is he ambidextrous?
- Yeah.

979
01:39:33,149 --> 01:39:35,743
Stenstrom's wife said
the man shot her husband...

980
01:39:36,085 --> 01:39:39,316
...then tossed the gun back
and forth, shoWing off...

981
01:39:39,589 --> 01:39:42,422
...and shot him again
With the other hand.

982
01:39:45,295 --> 01:39:49,163
- I can't talk about this right now.
- Sure.

983
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:54,066
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I just thought I ought to let you knoW.

984
01:39:54,305 --> 01:39:57,968
Fine. I've got to go.

985
01:40:15,095 --> 01:40:17,689
I thought you went to the store.

986
01:40:22,836 --> 01:40:25,361
I grabbed the wrong keys.

987
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:30,475
Those are the right keys.
Those are Jackie's.

988
01:40:33,181 --> 01:40:36,241
- What are you working on?
- Nothing.

989
01:40:39,021 --> 01:40:43,515
- You want to run out to get champagne?
- I'm not in the mood.

990
01:40:44,059 --> 01:40:46,653
- Ouch, Tom.
- I'm sorry.

991
01:40:47,197 --> 01:40:49,791
Well, let's just talk, then.

992
01:40:51,301 --> 01:40:52,962
Talk about what?

993
01:40:54,839 --> 01:40:58,331
About what you were talking
about on the phone.

994
01:40:59,376 --> 01:41:04,177
What, you think I'm stupid, Claire?
You must.

995
01:41:04,448 --> 01:41:08,885
Why not talk to me about it?
You like to keep secrets with Grimes.

996
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:12,988
Your life is one big secret.

997
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:20,396
Did you do it, Tom?

998
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:22,895
You can tell me.

999
01:41:24,170 --> 01:41:26,638
I certainly have a right to know.

1000
01:41:26,974 --> 01:41:31,877
Risked my life for it. Lost a baby.

1001
01:41:34,448 --> 01:41:39,351
Did you kill those people?

1002
01:41:42,557 --> 01:41:44,388
Yes.

1003
01:41:45,995 --> 01:41:47,690
I did.

1004
01:41:48,330 --> 01:41:52,528
I had to. That's what
I was trained to do, Claire.

1005
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:57,336
They lied to me.
They told me they were terrorists.

1006
01:41:57,607 --> 01:42:00,041
They told me to interrogate them.

1007
01:42:00,911 --> 01:42:04,608
And so you do What you have
to do to get every...

1008
01:42:04,881 --> 01:42:10,478
...any kind of information you can
out of them, and so I did.

1009
01:42:11,656 --> 01:42:15,524
Because I was the best at it.
And they knew it.

1010
01:42:16,727 --> 01:42:21,164
- What about Stenstrom and Allen?
- What about Stenstrom and Allen?

1011
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:25,727
Stenstrom saw me
on the street one day...

1012
01:42:26,071 --> 01:42:30,064
...and he told Allen.
And they needed to go away, you see?

1013
01:42:30,376 --> 01:42:32,810
Do not look at me like that!

1014
01:42:34,547 --> 01:42:37,948
I do not deserve it.

1015
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:47,989
Sorry.

1016
01:42:48,830 --> 01:42:50,798
I've been tired.

1017
01:42:51,766 --> 01:42:57,864
I was just protecting us.
We'll get over this. You'll see.

1018
01:42:58,240 --> 01:42:59,673
Honey?

1019
01:43:31,510 --> 01:43:34,946
Stop it! Stop it!

1020
01:43:35,681 --> 01:43:38,548
Oh, God, you're hurting me.
You're hurting me.

1021
01:43:40,553 --> 01:43:43,215
You're hurting me. You're hurting me.

1022
01:43:44,724 --> 01:43:47,022
Tom, stop it!

1023
01:43:47,727 --> 01:43:52,323
Tom, look at me, look at me.
Honey, honey.

1024
01:43:52,667 --> 01:43:58,196
Shut up, shut up. You're a liar.
Liar. Don't lie to me.

1025
01:43:59,708 --> 01:44:01,437
Liar.

1026
01:44:07,949 --> 01:44:11,316
I didn't want to have
to do this to you, Claire.

1027
01:44:11,521 --> 01:44:13,284
Tom.

1028
01:46:07,047 --> 01:46:08,810
It's okay.

1029
01:46:09,616 --> 01:46:11,516
It's okay.

1030
01:46:52,563 --> 01:46:54,463
I'm sorry.

1031
01:47:19,460 --> 01:47:23,157
From Santa Cruz to Walnut Creek,
San Rafael to Salinas...

1032
01:47:23,464 --> 01:47:28,458
...Oakland to San Francisco, you're
listening to the number one station...

1033
01:47:28,737 --> 01:47:31,365
...for sports, neWs and information.

1034
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:10,444
You have a whole suite of offices.

1035
01:48:10,916 --> 01:48:15,250
Yeah, but don't talk about it
because I might get spooked.

1036
01:48:15,788 --> 01:48:18,916
I mean, who knows what might happen?

1037
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:22,326
How are you holding up?

1038
01:48:23,496 --> 01:48:25,327
I'm okay.

1039
01:48:27,033 --> 01:48:29,934
- Same old associate?
- Oh, yeah.

1040
01:48:30,137 --> 01:48:32,697
She's back there
in the back somewhere.

1041
01:48:33,007 --> 01:48:37,103
I brought her a bone back from lunch,
so she's probably busy.

1042
01:48:37,311 --> 01:48:41,372
Hello. Come see me.
You're beautiful.

1043
01:48:41,616 --> 01:48:43,447
Hello.

1044
01:48:44,486 --> 01:48:48,718
You know, I often ask myself
why I never left San Lazaro.

1045
01:48:48,992 --> 01:48:55,556
It occurred to me that I never left
because I didn't have anyplace to go.

1046
01:48:57,500 --> 01:49:01,994
You know, it could read
Grimes and Ikubik.

1047
01:49:15,353 --> 01:49:18,186
It's got to say Grimaldi.

1048
01:49:19,558 --> 01:49:24,518
My maiden name. And, Charlie, you
gotta do something about these colors.

1049
01:49:25,398 --> 01:49:30,028
Well, I'm very sensitive
about my work environment.

1050
01:49:30,337 --> 01:49:31,827
Really? So?

1051
01:49:32,105 --> 01:49:37,509
I was thinking about a tropical color,
with a contrasting print.

1052
01:49:37,811 --> 01:49:39,005
Claire!

1053
01:49:39,247 --> 01:49:43,707
Check out this exterior.
It's skid-row chic, I understand that.

1054
01:49:44,052 --> 01:49:47,215
But the watermarks gotta go.
That's a given.
