1
00:00:13,792 --> 00:00:17,757
# The falling leaves

2
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:21,723
# Drift by the window

3
00:00:22,442 --> 00:00:24,922
# The autumn leaves

4
00:00:25,912 --> 00:00:28,995
# Of red and gold

5
00:00:29,682 --> 00:00:32,480
# I see your lips

6
00:00:32,892 --> 00:00:36,237
# The summer kisses

7
00:00:36,882 --> 00:00:40,272
# The sunburned hand

8
00:00:40,632 --> 00:00:43,487
# I used to hold

9
00:00:44,682 --> 00:00:47,958
# Since you went away

10
00:00:48,472 --> 00:00:51,452
# The days grow long

11
00:00:52,042 --> 00:00:55,443
# And soon I'll hear

12
00:00:55,478 --> 00:00:58,844
# Old winter's song

13
00:00:59,842 --> 00:01:03,596
# But I miss you most of all

14
00:01:03,832 --> 00:01:06,608
# My darling

15
00:01:07,322 --> 00:01:12,786
# When autumn leaves

16
00:01:12,821 --> 00:01:18,251
# Start to fall #

17
00:01:53,362 --> 00:01:55,410
Well, that's that.

18
00:01:57,922 --> 00:01:59,480
Come in.

19
00:02:01,085 --> 00:02:03,087
Liz - I can't believe it.

20
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:06,398
It's me all right - old unfaithful.

21
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:08,200
Picked up your evening paper.

22
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:12,649
Thanks. Haven't seen you for ages.
Where have you been?

23
00:02:12,684 --> 00:02:16,242
Working day and night.
Just like you, Milly.

24
00:02:16,277 --> 00:02:19,800
Good to see you again.
Be with you in a minute.

25
00:02:19,842 --> 00:02:23,207
OK. Present for you.

26
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:28,202
Ain't had a chance to socialise much
but I hear you type yourself silly.

27
00:02:28,237 --> 00:02:32,127
It's a rush job.
He's coming by any minute.

28
00:02:32,162 --> 00:02:33,300
What's this?

29
00:02:33,328 --> 00:02:37,287
Some typing for you
somebody left with me by mistake.

30
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:40,127
I'm glad somebody made that mistake.

31
00:02:40,162 --> 00:02:45,626
You don't want to be one of those
people who just drop by for the rent.

32
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:51,091
If you behave like a landlady, I'll
complain about that squeaking door.

33
00:02:51,202 --> 00:02:55,047
That's life.
If it ain't a squeak it's a squawk.

34
00:02:55,082 --> 00:03:00,884
Sit there and I'll make tea and we'll
drink your squeaks and squawks away.

35
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:04,761
I wish I could...
but I ain't got time to breathe.

36
00:03:04,796 --> 00:03:09,210
I gotta rush over to see my brother.
D'you ever meet him?

37
00:03:09,245 --> 00:03:11,361
I dunno. Did I?

38
00:03:11,396 --> 00:03:17,448
The one who married
that blonde pain from Alabama,
tall and skinny but all muscle.

39
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:19,150
My brother, I mean.

40
00:03:19,164 --> 00:03:23,612
At least you have a family.
You can't win that on a quiz show.

41
00:03:25,676 --> 00:03:29,726
Those guys are never late.
Come in, Mr Ramsey.

42
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:31,150
Afternoon.

43
00:03:31,206 --> 00:03:33,201
Good afternoon.

44
00:03:33,236 --> 00:03:34,000
Have I come too early?

45
00:03:34,043 --> 00:03:35,150
Nope.

46
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:38,287
That's great. Simply great.

47
00:03:39,206 --> 00:03:43,722
It's all finished! 126 pages.
Isn't it great?

48
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:45,750
How should I know? I ain't read it.

49
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:50,804
Miss Wetherby's speed - incredible.
Now I can get this to my publisher.

50
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:56,319
I don't know how to thank you. I'd
like to give you more than your fee.

51
00:03:56,356 --> 00:04:01,601
Mr Ramsey, you always pay your bill
on time. I'm glad you're happy.

52
00:04:01,756 --> 00:04:04,202
Wait! Here.

53
00:04:04,396 --> 00:04:08,806
Two tickets for tonight.
I assume you like good music?

54
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:13,171
Oh, I do. But thank you, no,
I couldn't accept them.

55
00:04:13,206 --> 00:04:18,849
Well, my lady friend doesn't
care much for that music. Please?

56
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:21,654
Please?

57
00:04:22,687 --> 00:04:26,896
Symphony Hall!
This is very kind of you, Mr Ramsey.

58
00:04:27,087 --> 00:04:29,738
Not at all. I hope you enjoy it.

59
00:04:29,773 --> 00:04:31,797
Thank you.

60
00:04:33,847 --> 00:04:35,852
Oh, yes!

61
00:04:35,887 --> 00:04:38,845
I never thought
this would be 126 pages.

62
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,056
Well... goodbye everybody.

63
00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:43,000
Your manuscript!

64
00:04:43,093 --> 00:04:44,150
Oh, I'm sorry.

65
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:47,007
Thanks again.

66
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:50,564
Let me see those tickets.

67
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:52,922
Second balcony. Cheap crumb!

68
00:04:52,957 --> 00:04:57,690
Whatever you say, you're wrong.
He's poor. This is a sweet gesture.

69
00:04:57,725 --> 00:05:01,652
Second balcony.
Any higher you'd get a nosebleed!

70
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:06,343
You're the world champ when it comes
to believing these chisellers!

71
00:05:06,378 --> 00:05:11,000
He could at least ask you out - or
did he want to save the bus fare?

72
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:13,412
He almost did once.

73
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:17,213
Well, ain't that somethin'?
What stopped him?

74
00:05:17,248 --> 00:05:19,172
What?!

75
00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:25,897
That's the story of my life.
He was so sure I was tied up
with my "gentlemen friends".

76
00:05:25,932 --> 00:05:28,162
What gentlemen friends?

77
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:31,500
Liz, didn't you see that mob
out there waiting to take me out?

78
00:05:31,576 --> 00:05:35,888
Hey, what kind of tea do you drink?

79
00:05:36,447 --> 00:05:42,306
I've been told so often "You're so
attractive, lovely, so this, so that"

80
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:45,334
Then they assume I'm all tied up!

81
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:47,732
All tied up!

82
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:52,056
Makes me feel like a package
and I'm left alone!

83
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:01,600
If you ask me, you give 'em
the brushoff. Don't ask me why.

84
00:06:01,651 --> 00:06:05,087
Maybe I'm just too choosy?

85
00:06:05,687 --> 00:06:09,168
Maybe you're just plain scared?

86
00:06:10,977 --> 00:06:14,000
Whatever the reason, I have two
tickets for tonight. Be my guest?

87
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:17,955
Thanks but I can't. For nine reasons

88
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,577
First, I can't stand that music.

89
00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:23,800
What happened
to the other eight reasons?

90
00:06:23,895 --> 00:06:25,898
Then there's my brother.

91
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:28,053
That did it.

92
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:30,132
I'll go alone.

93
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:32,900
I'm gonna get out of here
and make a night of it.

94
00:06:32,943 --> 00:06:34,934
To each his own.

95
00:06:35,087 --> 00:06:38,942
It's better than sitting here
by your lonesome.

96
00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:43,334
Believe me, I oughta know.
I'm an expert on being alone.

97
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:47,933
Yah. I've gotten used
to living alone, too.

98
00:06:48,247 --> 00:06:51,375
That's why I'm gonna get out of here.

99
00:06:52,377 --> 00:06:54,379
To the recital.

100
00:06:54,577 --> 00:06:57,296
I'm going to have myself a ball!

101
00:06:57,687 --> 00:07:02,332
Gardenia. Gardenia. One dollar.
Gardenias, madam.

102
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:05,700
Is it possible to exchange
two balconies for one orchestra?

103
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,694
Yes, ma'am.

104
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:09,748
One orchestra.

105
00:07:09,783 --> 00:07:11,768
Gardenias, madam.

106
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:14,818
Gardenias.

107
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:18,994
Thank you.
- Thank you, madam.

108
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:35,778
Hello? Oh, Paul.

109
00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:38,657
I'm afraid I can't make it tonight.

110
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:40,400
"Your father again?"

111
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:43,858
I'm sorry, Paul,
but I have to be fair.

112
00:08:43,893 --> 00:08:47,858
"How about being fair to me?
We can't go on this way."

113
00:08:47,893 --> 00:08:52,262
"Milly, you've got so much to give.
Don't throw your life away."

114
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:55,975
Paul. Paul, you used to be
so understanding.

115
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,618
"Sure I did.
But I can't take it any more."

116
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:06,422
"It's either him or me.
If you won't make up your mind,
somebody has to make it up for you!"

117
00:09:12,293 --> 00:09:15,258
Now, Milly, I want you to go out.

118
00:09:15,293 --> 00:09:20,253
I don't want to be the reason for
you breaking every date with Paul.

119
00:09:20,288 --> 00:09:24,338
He's been such a patient young man.
Too patient.

120
00:09:24,373 --> 00:09:29,982
It's all right. You'll get well soon,
then we'll all make up for lost time.

121
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:33,898
You're a good daughter
but I'm not getting any better.

122
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:37,993
You just can't tie yourself down
to me.

123
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:42,054
Don't worry about me.
I've plenty of time.

124
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:47,034
There's plenty of time.

125
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,550
Last booth's open, lady.
Be with you in a minute.

126
00:12:07,592 --> 00:12:09,107
Thank you.

127
00:12:14,103 --> 00:12:18,676
You'll have to wait a minute,
mister. We're full up.

128
00:12:43,423 --> 00:12:45,744
What'll you have?

129
00:12:55,313 --> 00:12:58,828
Anything quick.
Er, chicken salad, no bread.

130
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:01,656
Anything to drink?
- No, thank you.

131
00:13:05,263 --> 00:13:07,675
Mind if join you? Please?

132
00:13:10,273 --> 00:13:12,992
I'm sorry, I'd prefer you didn't.

133
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,235
Oh!

134
00:13:19,343 --> 00:13:24,918
I didn't mean to sound rude. You're
alone. This is the only empty spot.

135
00:13:24,953 --> 00:13:27,917
Empty except for you, I mean.

136
00:13:27,952 --> 00:13:30,881
I'd still prefer you didn't.

137
00:13:31,913 --> 00:13:37,203
I only asked because there's
really no other place to sit down.

138
00:13:37,238 --> 00:13:41,311
I'm accustomed to sitting...
I prefer to sit alone.

139
00:13:41,423 --> 00:13:45,439
That's OK, I can wait for you
to finish your salad.

140
00:13:45,474 --> 00:13:48,268
I'd have to gulp it with you waiting.

141
00:13:48,303 --> 00:13:55,709
No, don't do that, please. You just
take your time. I can stand.
You get used to standing in the army

142
00:14:04,073 --> 00:14:09,147
Well, if you're going to stand there
you might as well sit here.

143
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,078
You, er... sure it's all right?

144
00:14:12,273 --> 00:14:14,673
I suppose.

145
00:14:29,113 --> 00:14:32,002
You know something? You're lonely.

146
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:35,724
Lonely?

147
00:14:35,913 --> 00:14:39,280
I think you're being
rather presumptuous.

148
00:14:39,315 --> 00:14:42,318
My private life is personal.

149
00:14:42,353 --> 00:14:48,917
I'm just stating a fact. You can
correct me, I'll stand corrected...
but sitting down.

150
00:14:48,993 --> 00:14:50,998
Joke.

151
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:53,676
It's no disgrace to be lonely.

152
00:14:53,711 --> 00:14:56,319
Nowadays everybody's lonely.

153
00:14:56,473 --> 00:15:01,160
I'm tired and my feet hurt
but that isn't why I'm glad I'm here

154
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:05,617
I'm glad because you look like
somebody I'd like to talk to.

155
00:15:05,652 --> 00:15:10,042
Really?
- Uh-huh. But you know what I see
in your face?

156
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:12,118
Fear.

157
00:15:12,153 --> 00:15:15,118
Why? Cos you don't know me.

158
00:15:15,153 --> 00:15:18,839
That sounds reasonable
but frankly it's cockeyed.

159
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:21,595
You shouldn't be afraid of me.

160
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,316
I think it's a matter of opinion.

161
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:26,486
I think...

162
00:15:26,763 --> 00:15:30,039
I don't know what I think.

163
00:15:31,593 --> 00:15:34,653
I'm sorry. I'll keep quiet.

164
00:15:35,673 --> 00:15:38,676
I won't talk any more if you prefer.

165
00:15:38,953 --> 00:15:42,013
I do prefer!

166
00:15:48,523 --> 00:15:50,200
Yes?

167
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:52,558
I didn't say anything.

168
00:15:52,593 --> 00:15:53,650
But the way you were staring.

169
00:15:53,673 --> 00:15:57,121
No, I promised
I wouldn't say anything.

170
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,300
But you were staring at me.

171
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:02,327
No, not at you. At your purse.

172
00:16:03,323 --> 00:16:05,279
Oh.

173
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:15,150
Yes.

174
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:18,323
I like your taste in music.

175
00:16:22,923 --> 00:16:24,400
About that purse?

176
00:16:24,493 --> 00:16:26,478
Purse?

177
00:16:26,513 --> 00:16:33,316
If you were to drop it,
no matter which way it came up
you'd always know it was yours.

178
00:16:33,351 --> 00:16:35,278
May I?

179
00:16:35,313 --> 00:16:37,808
Up... down.

180
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:42,121
Either way
it's always the same - MW.

181
00:16:42,156 --> 00:16:44,684
Is that a reason for staring?

182
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:46,600
Mary Walker?

183
00:16:46,651 --> 00:16:49,550
I beg your pardon?

184
00:16:49,598 --> 00:16:52,203
Mildred... Williams?

185
00:16:52,238 --> 00:16:53,688
Oh!

186
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:56,198
Am I right?
- No.

187
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:59,088
Well, not Martha Washington?!

188
00:16:59,123 --> 00:17:01,380
No, Millicent Wetherby.

189
00:17:01,415 --> 00:17:03,638
Millicent Wetherby. Milly?

190
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:05,150
That's right.

191
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:09,321
Burt Hanson. Formerly
Sergeant Hanson of the US Army.

192
00:17:09,356 --> 00:17:10,250
How d'you do.

193
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,567
How do you do.

194
00:17:15,163 --> 00:17:17,550
Well, what are you gonna have?

195
00:17:17,563 --> 00:17:22,092
Um, the same as Miss Wetherby.
A quick chicken salad.

196
00:17:22,243 --> 00:17:24,199
Right.

197
00:17:25,723 --> 00:17:29,011
Except now we don't have to go...

198
00:17:29,046 --> 00:17:30,994
...do we?

199
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:31,850
No.

200
00:17:31,891 --> 00:17:33,769
So... relax.

201
00:17:33,923 --> 00:17:35,888
Am I tense?

202
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:42,931
You're stuck with me for the
duration of that salad. You might as
well go ahead, talk, say something.

203
00:17:42,966 --> 00:17:46,888
I'm not very good
at this casual conversation.

204
00:17:46,923 --> 00:17:50,700
Sure you are. You haven't
stopped talking since I sat down.

205
00:17:50,723 --> 00:17:52,737
Are you teasing me?

206
00:17:53,163 --> 00:17:58,648
Mm-hm. Like I did about your purse.
I want you to relax. So we can talk.

207
00:17:58,683 --> 00:18:05,407
You see, people don't realise
how important that is -
talking to somebody who listens.

208
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:08,725
You're the best listener
since Matsu Rikyoto.

209
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,700
Since who?

210
00:18:09,712 --> 00:18:15,287
Matsu Rikyoto. A 12-year-old kid in
Tokyo, sold those paper-dragon kites

211
00:18:15,403 --> 00:18:17,800
You were with the army in Tokyo?

212
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:22,652
Honour Guard, headquarters. No hero
stuff. We never even left Japan.

213
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:27,456
With what I learnt as a supply
sergeant, I'll do fine in this town.

214
00:18:27,491 --> 00:18:29,800
You work in LA?
- Yes, three years now.

215
00:18:29,853 --> 00:18:32,652
I like LA. I'm gonna make good here.

216
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:36,244
I'm sure you will. Where're you from?

217
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:37,000
Before the army?

218
00:18:37,084 --> 00:18:37,900
Mm-hm.

219
00:18:37,926 --> 00:18:40,168
Racine, Wisconsin.

220
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:43,094
You ever been to Racine?
- No.

221
00:18:43,129 --> 00:18:44,550
You native Californian?

222
00:18:44,606 --> 00:18:47,006
An immigrant from New England.

223
00:18:47,163 --> 00:18:51,658
I have two sisters and a brother
back there and their children.

224
00:18:51,693 --> 00:18:59,008
I can't imagine anyone
ever leaving their family
if they're lucky enough to have one.

225
00:18:59,043 --> 00:19:03,224
I never knew my mother,
my father died when I was so high.

226
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:05,932
Hey, let's not depress each other.

227
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:07,925
OK.

228
00:19:18,973 --> 00:19:21,248
Then there's the other side.

229
00:19:21,283 --> 00:19:25,058
A fella sits down next to you
you've never seen.

230
00:19:25,093 --> 00:19:31,817
All you know about him is he spent
a couple of soft years in Tokyo
and kidded you about your purse.

231
00:19:31,852 --> 00:19:35,328
Now he's showing off
by picking up the check.

232
00:19:35,443 --> 00:19:40,378
That's the kind of character you got
a perfect right to be suspicious of.

233
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:48,104
Frankly, I think our relationship
will last a lot longer if the first
time you pick up your own check.

234
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:50,004
OK?

235
00:20:06,853 --> 00:20:12,496
When I finished business school I
could type 70 words a minute or more.

236
00:20:12,531 --> 00:20:15,098
Then came the secretarial jobs.

237
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:20,264
I found it more fun to work at home.
I like the feeling of independence.

238
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:24,728
Maybe it's my New England heritage,
that I'm so frugal.

239
00:20:24,763 --> 00:20:29,416
Living and working at home
means you only have one rent to pay.

240
00:20:29,451 --> 00:20:32,593
I haven't stopped talking
since downtown.

241
00:20:32,628 --> 00:20:35,736
And the way you've listened!
You're heroic.

242
00:20:35,853 --> 00:20:40,574
Don't worry about me. Live and
laugh, that's what I always say.

243
00:20:40,653 --> 00:20:42,701
Agree? Sure you do.

244
00:20:44,013 --> 00:20:46,208
Hey, this is very nice.

245
00:20:46,243 --> 00:20:49,417
Hi, Liz, I'd like you...
- I'm glad you had a good time!

246
00:20:49,493 --> 00:20:53,817
Tonight my brother and his wife
dragged me to the beach.

247
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:58,141
They wanted to fight
and get some air at the same time.

248
00:20:58,176 --> 00:21:01,296
They made up as usual.
And where am I?

249
00:21:01,933 --> 00:21:03,935
Getting sand in my shoes.

250
00:21:04,093 --> 00:21:06,982
Liz, I'd like you to meet Burt Hanson

251
00:21:07,093 --> 00:21:12,019
Pleased, I'm sure.
Excuse me... but I've got sand...

252
00:21:12,054 --> 00:21:13,853
...everywhere!

253
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,200
Who's the character?

254
00:21:21,263 --> 00:21:23,615
Liz Eckhart. She's the manager.

255
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:27,620
She's always dress for Halloween
in the middle of summer?

256
00:21:27,655 --> 00:21:31,415
That's one
of her most conservative outfits.

257
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:36,069
I'll tell you about her clothes -
they grow on you and so does she.

258
00:21:36,104 --> 00:21:37,100
This is it, huh?

259
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,095
Mm-hm. This is it.

260
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,300
Well, good night, Milly.

261
00:21:41,371 --> 00:21:44,090
Good night, Burt. And thanks.

262
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,660
Wait a minute.

263
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,495
Can't end a date
without giving you a present.

264
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:06,418
You're your own boss. Give yourself
a half day off tomorrow.

265
00:22:06,453 --> 00:22:09,174
I can't when there's work to do.

266
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:14,734
Give yourself a break and do me a
favour. We can go to the beach, OK?

267
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:16,745
That would be very nice.

268
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,295
Great. I'll pick you up at noon.
Goodbye, Milly.

269
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,861
Oh!

270
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,800
Be seeing you, Liz!

271
00:22:27,857 --> 00:22:31,191
Liz?

272
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,567
Oh!

273
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:10,806
I knew I should have gone
on that diet!

274
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:20,090
Hey, are you still in there?

275
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,654
Er... I'll be out in a minute.

276
00:23:22,689 --> 00:23:24,941
What's keeping you?

277
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:27,112
Erm...

278
00:23:27,147 --> 00:23:29,471
...nothing.

279
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:47,003
Hey.

280
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:51,214
I thought you were gonna
settle in there permanently.

281
00:23:51,249 --> 00:23:52,608
You're not going swimming in that?

282
00:23:52,652 --> 00:23:54,681
I sunburn very easily.

283
00:23:54,716 --> 00:23:56,668
Well, that's too bad.

284
00:23:56,703 --> 00:24:01,555
We, er... should've brought along
a little suntan lotion.

285
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,712
There we are.

286
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:06,149
D'you like it?

287
00:24:06,184 --> 00:24:08,322
That's a nice suit.

288
00:24:08,357 --> 00:24:10,885
But then look who's in it. Come on.

289
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:17,612
I'm glad we came on a day when there
aren't too many people, aren't you?

290
00:24:17,808 --> 00:24:22,931
Hey, wait. In case any photographers
want your picture for the papers...

291
00:24:22,966 --> 00:24:28,054
...we don't want 'em to know it cost
12.95 when it looks like a million.

292
00:24:37,031 --> 00:24:40,040
What's the matter? Can't you swim?

293
00:24:40,075 --> 00:24:46,089
Sure. I was the first woman to swim
the English Channel both ways.
Underwater!

294
00:24:46,124 --> 00:24:50,889
Well, come on. Follow me,
I'll teach you how. Come on!

295
00:25:21,845 --> 00:25:23,931
You all right?

296
00:25:23,966 --> 00:25:25,975
I think so.

297
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:28,058
Why don't you breathe?

298
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:31,625
That's the coward's way. Can't
breathe and swim at the same time.

299
00:25:32,626 --> 00:25:34,585
People do.

300
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,641
Gee, your shoulders are white.

301
00:25:59,621 --> 00:26:04,667
I'm not gonna bring you back here
till you learn how to swim.

302
00:26:04,702 --> 00:26:06,634
It's too dangerous.

303
00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:12,876
I don't know what I'd do
if anything ever happened to you.

304
00:26:36,855 --> 00:26:39,383
Oh, Milly.

305
00:26:39,579 --> 00:26:43,638
Good night. Burt, please
don't come back any more.

306
00:26:43,673 --> 00:26:50,166
Well...
- I mean it! Find a girl your own age.
There must be plenty, it's a big city

307
00:26:50,201 --> 00:26:51,022
Listen...

308
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:54,762
You're just lonesome.
All right, I'm lonesome too.

309
00:26:54,797 --> 00:27:00,287
But we can't have loneliness push us
together, it won't keep us together.

310
00:27:00,323 --> 00:27:03,903
Just loneliness
reaching out for loneliness.

311
00:27:03,938 --> 00:27:10,351
That isn't it...
- If you knew a girl your own age, you
wouldn't want me. And that isn't fair

312
00:27:10,386 --> 00:27:15,710
So, please, before things get
more complicated. Please, I mean it!

313
00:27:16,994 --> 00:27:18,998
Goodbye.

314
00:27:31,857 --> 00:27:33,862
Milly?

315
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:38,468
Milly?

316
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:52,767
Course you did right. You can't play
tick-tack-toe with your feelings.

317
00:27:52,802 --> 00:27:55,685
An earthquake for the nervous system

318
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:01,048
That's the problem of a sheltered
life - you react like a schoolgirl.

319
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:06,376
Then you make a fool of yourself and
at my age that is not very becoming.

320
00:28:06,411 --> 00:28:09,902
You've got your whole future
ahead of you.

321
00:28:09,937 --> 00:28:14,744
The only trouble with a future is it
comes so much sooner than it used to.

322
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:18,526
While you're at it,
forget about Burt too.

323
00:28:18,561 --> 00:28:22,273
You say that
as if you were reading my mind.

324
00:28:48,984 --> 00:28:50,416
Hi! Where you been?

325
00:28:50,476 --> 00:28:55,238
Early movie. No-one came by
while I was out, did they?

326
00:28:55,273 --> 00:28:57,202
Nope. Not a soul.

327
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:05,649
But how should I know?
I got other things to do
besides watch the traffic.

328
00:29:05,684 --> 00:29:07,660
Good night, Liz.

329
00:29:08,297 --> 00:29:11,977
Good night, Milly.
See you in the morning.

330
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:05,333
Their stuff isn't fresh. Those plums
must be from somebody's backyard...

331
00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:08,527
...and that French butcher's
charging Paris prices.

332
00:30:11,694 --> 00:30:13,140
Huh?

333
00:30:13,175 --> 00:30:16,137
Did you leave your door unlocked?

334
00:30:19,463 --> 00:30:22,219
Hey, Milly! You forgot something!

335
00:30:22,537 --> 00:30:25,795
Boy, oh, boy! Did you forget!

336
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:34,977
Hi, Milly!

337
00:30:35,012 --> 00:30:36,955
Hello, Burt.

338
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:44,684
I... I found the door unlocked
so I just came in and waited.

339
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:47,417
I'm glad it was unlocked.

340
00:30:47,452 --> 00:30:49,384
You are?

341
00:30:49,419 --> 00:30:56,230
I wouldn't want you climbing through
a window. Some of the neighbours
might not understand.

342
00:30:56,265 --> 00:31:00,998
I think I'd attract less attention
coming through the window...

343
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:06,170
...than coming through that squeaking
door. You sure look nice, Milly.

344
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,690
Oh, I stole this for you
from your garden.

345
00:31:13,087 --> 00:31:15,055
Thank you -

346
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:18,177
...for the flower and the compliment.

347
00:31:20,216 --> 00:31:24,225
You always were
a very gracious flower thief.

348
00:31:25,703 --> 00:31:27,004
You like the new record I got you?

349
00:31:27,114 --> 00:31:29,312
Very much.

350
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:34,564
Isn't it strange how that lovely song
reminds me of chicken salad?

351
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:38,562
You know,
we never did dance together.

352
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:49,456
Thanks for the record.

353
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,699
It's a long time since I saw you.

354
00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:54,342
One month.

355
00:31:54,377 --> 00:31:56,382
One whole month.

356
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:58,401
30 days.

357
00:31:58,436 --> 00:32:00,386
31 days.

358
00:32:02,156 --> 00:32:04,354
You dance nice, Milly.

359
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:06,354
So soft and warm.

360
00:32:20,569 --> 00:32:22,866
Did I say something wrong?

361
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:26,581
No, it's just that
we were forgetting to dance.

362
00:32:27,978 --> 00:32:29,054
Don't be so frightened.

363
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:33,274
I'm not. Or if I am
it's because I want to be.

364
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:35,191
Not frightened...

365
00:32:35,226 --> 00:32:37,288
...just a little careful.

366
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:38,873
Cautious.

367
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:51,125
Well, what's new with you?

368
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,209
Eat, sleep, go to the movies.

369
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:58,872
I got myself a job
at Hathaway's department store.

370
00:32:58,907 --> 00:33:01,223
I was promoted to section manager.

371
00:33:01,258 --> 00:33:03,425
Burt, that's wonderful!

372
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:08,108
Soon you'll be president.
When did all this happen?

373
00:33:08,143 --> 00:33:09,593
Today.

374
00:33:09,628 --> 00:33:13,967
And what are you doing here?
You should be out celebrating.

375
00:33:14,002 --> 00:33:17,927
I... I was hoping
we could celebrate it together.

376
00:33:20,731 --> 00:33:22,688
Oh. I see.

377
00:33:22,723 --> 00:33:25,702
No, you don't...
- Yes, I do.

378
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:29,701
Burt, in some way
you feel obligated to me...

379
00:33:29,736 --> 00:33:30,803
I know what I feel.

380
00:33:30,819 --> 00:33:37,631
...because I was company for you
when you were alone. With your
newjob you needn't be alone.

381
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:40,435
Milly, I met a lot of people...

382
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,804
...but I'm still lonely.

383
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:54,214
Oh!

384
00:33:55,773 --> 00:33:57,535
I've been seeing people...

385
00:33:57,584 --> 00:34:01,582
Are you sure you're meeting
live people?

386
00:34:03,663 --> 00:34:06,385
Well, they walk and they talk.

387
00:34:06,786 --> 00:34:09,515
Oh, Milly! I followed your advice.

388
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:14,761
I went out on dates. I just found
young people are too young for me.

389
00:34:14,796 --> 00:34:21,334
I took out a girl from ladies
sportswear. She was secretly in love
with Gregory Peck!

390
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:26,415
We stared at his autograph for one
whole evening. Can you picture that?

391
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:32,704
Yes. I'm in love with Gregory Peck,
too. I resent her interfering
with my love.

392
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:38,188
You can joke about it. Then I took
out that girl from leather goods.

393
00:34:38,223 --> 00:34:39,936
It couldn't be that bad!

394
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,193
She was a bubble-gum addict.

395
00:34:42,228 --> 00:34:42,910
A what?

396
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:47,919
A bubble-gum addict. While we danced
she popped gum in my ear.

397
00:34:47,954 --> 00:34:49,748
As long as she danced well.

398
00:34:49,806 --> 00:34:50,849
She was a jitterbug.

399
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,812
I adore them. Jitterbugs can be fun.

400
00:34:53,847 --> 00:34:56,813
With bubble gum popping in your ear?

401
00:34:56,848 --> 00:34:59,735
It depends upon your sense of rhythm.

402
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:05,465
Milly, don't laugh at me. I tried.
There are more. Why go through it?

403
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,349
I just didn't enjoy it, that's all?

404
00:35:09,392 --> 00:35:12,230
Ah, Milly! You wouldn't want me...

405
00:35:12,265 --> 00:35:16,650
...to spend the rest of my life
with a bubble-gum addict.

406
00:35:16,685 --> 00:35:18,679
Would you, Milly?

407
00:35:20,115 --> 00:35:22,082
Sorry I goofed.

408
00:35:22,117 --> 00:35:25,891
You goofed?! That's bop talk.
Where did you pick that up?

409
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:30,136
Why shouldn't I pick up
an expression here and there?

410
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:32,415
I'm not that old!

411
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:40,660
Burt...

412
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:44,201
...what did you really come here for?

413
00:35:45,755 --> 00:35:48,592
To ask you to dinner and a movie.

414
00:35:48,627 --> 00:35:50,020
Dinner and a movie...

415
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,690
Just to celebrate my newjob.

416
00:35:52,725 --> 00:35:54,665
OK?

417
00:35:55,437 --> 00:35:57,425
OK?

418
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,377
OK.

419
00:35:59,412 --> 00:36:01,489
Oh! I almost forgot.

420
00:36:01,524 --> 00:36:03,893
I brought you a little gift.

421
00:36:04,408 --> 00:36:06,385
Some caviar.

422
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,548
To eat with our popcorn.

423
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:13,674
It's a new fad - caviar and popcorn.
Movies really are better than ever.

424
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,546
Hm. Looks more like a dog leg to me.

425
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,458
Oh, drat it! Into the woods.

426
00:36:40,982 --> 00:36:42,089
Do you want a cigarette?

427
00:36:42,189 --> 00:36:44,274
Sure! All right.

428
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:55,802
Thank you.

429
00:36:57,717 --> 00:37:00,726
Oh, I left the caviar at your place!

430
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:05,251
We'll have to eat straight popcorn
like everybody else. I love the smell

431
00:37:05,286 --> 00:37:09,696
Look, Milly, I've got something
important to say right here and now.

432
00:37:09,731 --> 00:37:16,321
I didn't come back to go
to a movie or have a date
or eat dinner or anything like that.

433
00:37:16,356 --> 00:37:22,912
I came back because I can't get you
off my mind. Night and day,
week in, week out...

434
00:37:22,947 --> 00:37:27,873
Burt, didn't you ever know a girl
your own age whom you liked?

435
00:37:28,063 --> 00:37:30,079
Yeah.

436
00:37:31,077 --> 00:37:35,322
It was a long time ago. It was
high school stuff, that's all.

437
00:37:35,357 --> 00:37:39,567
I don't really remember her.
I guess she was my girlfriend.

438
00:37:39,767 --> 00:37:42,065
Whatever happened to her?

439
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:47,306
Who knows? I grew up and went
my way and I guess she went hers.

440
00:37:48,418 --> 00:37:50,502
I wish you'd marry me.

441
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:56,823
You've been gone a month,
nothing has changed -

442
00:37:56,858 --> 00:38:01,402
...I'm a month older and so are you,
nothing else is different.

443
00:38:01,438 --> 00:38:06,041
Let me finish. You can walk out
on me but hear me out.

444
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:08,886
Milly, you're special.

445
00:38:09,844 --> 00:38:14,172
You're like no other girl
I've ever known or expect to know.

446
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:16,797
You're so special I've got to say it

447
00:38:16,818 --> 00:38:18,834
No, you don't, darling.

448
00:38:19,015 --> 00:38:23,042
You don't know how much
it is really. Look, Milly...

449
00:38:23,077 --> 00:38:27,069
...I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

450
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:29,634
No more being alone...

451
00:38:29,669 --> 00:38:32,125
...for you or for me.

452
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:38,448
I've got to know tonight
if you want me because if you don't
I'll stop this dreaming.

453
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:42,808
Burt, listen carefully.
You're mixing up things.

454
00:38:42,843 --> 00:38:47,148
You're confusing a need for me
with I don't know what...

455
00:38:47,184 --> 00:38:51,136
...but that's all it is, Burt,
just a need.

456
00:38:51,374 --> 00:38:58,026
You mustn't let it drive you
into thinking impulsively
or do anything impulsively.

457
00:39:00,194 --> 00:39:05,160
Look at it this way - we met,
you were filled with a need...

458
00:39:05,195 --> 00:39:08,134
...I had a need, but people don't...

459
00:39:08,324 --> 00:39:12,444
They shouldn't get married
because they're lonely.

460
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:18,573
It can also happen like this -
two people meet each other
and right away they know.

461
00:39:18,608 --> 00:39:20,582
I love you, Milly.

462
00:39:24,293 --> 00:39:26,298
Love me?

463
00:39:28,228 --> 00:39:30,198
I love you.

464
00:39:31,782 --> 00:39:34,515
And if you'll take a chance...

465
00:39:35,597 --> 00:39:37,564
I mean...

466
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,879
...will you take the chance?

467
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,915
You don't have to answer that.

468
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,162
You wanna see the rest of the movie?

469
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:08,147
No.

470
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:12,008
I just want to go home.

471
00:40:48,645 --> 00:40:52,893
Would you mind telling me
why you turned me down?

472
00:40:52,928 --> 00:40:55,293
I'd honestly like to know.

473
00:40:56,294 --> 00:40:59,266
I tried to tell you once before.

474
00:40:59,301 --> 00:41:02,025
I'm older than you are.

475
00:41:03,663 --> 00:41:06,531
It's just too much that difference.

476
00:41:06,566 --> 00:41:09,400
It isn't because I don't like you.

477
00:41:09,435 --> 00:41:11,357
Of course I do.

478
00:41:11,392 --> 00:41:15,561
That's not the reason.
Thanks for trying to be easy on me.

479
00:41:15,596 --> 00:41:19,532
Oh! It is the reason
and the only reason!

480
00:41:19,567 --> 00:41:21,764
It just couldn't work.

481
00:41:22,726 --> 00:41:27,054
I've got nerve asking you
to spend your life with me!

482
00:41:27,089 --> 00:41:29,294
Burt Hanson. Big deal!

483
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:31,298
Big nothing.

484
00:41:35,941 --> 00:41:38,105
Well, this is it, huh?

485
00:41:46,564 --> 00:41:48,717
Burt!

486
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:52,724
Burt!

487
00:41:53,573 --> 00:41:56,170
Can a girl change her mind?

488
00:41:57,888 --> 00:42:01,943
Oh, Milly!
Don't make it so rough on a guy!

489
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,900
No, never!

490
00:42:03,935 --> 00:42:05,983
Never again, I promise!

491
00:42:06,018 --> 00:42:11,827
Let's get married right away. We'll
rent a car, we'll drive to Mexico...

492
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:16,803
...we'll be married before you
have a chance to change your mind.

493
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:19,955
I'll pick you up at eight. OK?

494
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:23,974
OK.

495
00:42:24,009 --> 00:42:26,766
And I hope you'll never...

496
00:42:26,801 --> 00:42:28,740
...ever be sorry.

497
00:42:28,775 --> 00:42:33,217
I won't be. I hope you won't be
but I never will be.

498
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,091
They're beautiful!

499
00:43:30,126 --> 00:43:32,067
There.

500
00:43:55,061 --> 00:43:59,278
Do you think it's really legal?
All I did was say "Si."

501
00:43:59,313 --> 00:44:01,652
I didn't say "I do" once.

502
00:44:01,687 --> 00:44:03,991
You want to say "I do"?

503
00:44:04,026 --> 00:44:06,206
I just did.

504
00:44:06,241 --> 00:44:12,452
Meanwhile, do you think
Liz can get along without us
during our honeymoon week?

505
00:44:12,487 --> 00:44:17,492
Why did you tell the marriage-licence
girl that you were born in Chicago?

506
00:44:17,527 --> 00:44:19,791
Because I was born there.

507
00:44:19,826 --> 00:44:24,043
I thought you once said
Racine, Wisconsin?

508
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,684
Born and raised in Racine.

509
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:31,643
Not me. Must've been
some other fella you wanted to hook.

510
00:44:31,678 --> 00:44:34,058
No, you're the one I wanted.

511
00:44:34,093 --> 00:44:38,892
I'm glad I hooked you. It makes me
feel more and more satisfied.

512
00:44:40,535 --> 00:44:42,791
You know something?

513
00:44:42,826 --> 00:44:44,317
No.

514
00:44:44,352 --> 00:44:46,392
I don't know something.

515
00:44:49,642 --> 00:44:52,491
I don't want to go to work today.

516
00:44:57,857 --> 00:45:00,342
How about that orange juice?

517
00:45:00,533 --> 00:45:05,514
Orange juice! Breakfast now
being served. Dining at the rear.

518
00:45:05,549 --> 00:45:09,284
Now I know why you married me -
for my cooking.

519
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:11,423
Your cooking?

520
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,491
My cooking.

521
00:45:13,526 --> 00:45:18,143
That's a good one!
Canned orange juice, instant coffee.

522
00:45:18,178 --> 00:45:21,942
I'm still trying to find
canned buttered toast.

523
00:45:22,132 --> 00:45:27,317
I know what I really like about you -
the way you sleep at night...

524
00:45:27,352 --> 00:45:34,168
...with your nose all crinkled up.
I could strangle you
the way you pull the covers off me.

525
00:45:34,365 --> 00:45:39,904
I look at you each morning, I always
think of reasons not to go to work.

526
00:45:42,299 --> 00:45:47,795
I wouldn't want to impede the
progress of my future assistant buyer

527
00:45:51,196 --> 00:45:53,567
You're impeding pretty good!

528
00:45:53,602 --> 00:45:55,529
Happy anniversary!

529
00:45:55,564 --> 00:45:57,128
Weekiversary. The second one.

530
00:45:57,172 --> 00:45:59,978
All right. Happy second weekiversary.

531
00:46:00,013 --> 00:46:04,236
Burt, remember,
don't bring home any more presents.

532
00:46:04,271 --> 00:46:09,070
Yes, Mrs Hanson. Of course,
Mrs Hanson. Indeed, Mrs Hanson.

533
00:46:09,105 --> 00:46:11,885
You are Mrs Hanson!

534
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:18,298
I mean it, Burt, about the presents.
We've been celebrating all week -

535
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:22,405
...the candy dish, the portable bar -
we won't have any money.

536
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,478
I don't have to pay for it.
It comes off my next paycheck.

537
00:46:26,673 --> 00:46:29,670
You have to pay for it next week.

538
00:46:29,705 --> 00:46:33,007
It's this week we celebrate.

539
00:46:33,042 --> 00:46:34,346
Here!

540
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:38,885
He said he'd come by early
but not this early. Come on!

541
00:46:40,418 --> 00:46:42,560
Anybody there?

542
00:46:42,595 --> 00:46:44,661
Come in, Colonel.

543
00:46:44,696 --> 00:46:51,638
Colonel Hillier, this is
my husband Burt Hanson. I'm sorry
I'm not dressed but I overslept.

544
00:46:51,673 --> 00:46:56,849
I heard the news from Mrs Eckhart.
Congratulations and best wishes.

545
00:46:56,884 --> 00:46:57,790
Thank you.

546
00:46:57,807 --> 00:47:00,621
I suppose Mrs Wetherby will...

547
00:47:00,656 --> 00:47:03,977
Mrs Hanson, you'I be retiring soon?

548
00:47:04,012 --> 00:47:08,036
Not until I've typed your manuscript.
Last installment.

549
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:13,239
I don't believe in married women
working. You seen much combat?

550
00:47:13,274 --> 00:47:14,206
Military intelligence.

551
00:47:14,241 --> 00:47:19,371
I was in the combat infantry.
Spent two years with the 322nd.

552
00:47:20,122 --> 00:47:23,781
Goodbye.
Yeah, we had 40 per cent casualties.

553
00:47:23,816 --> 00:47:24,665
Good day.

554
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,461
I'd be glad to tell you about it.

555
00:47:27,496 --> 00:47:33,229
We got sent straight over from the
States. We didn't even stop off...

556
00:47:48,294 --> 00:47:50,358
Come in, Liz.

557
00:47:59,565 --> 00:48:00,708
Yes?

558
00:48:00,808 --> 00:48:03,355
I'm looking for Burt Hanson.

559
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:05,862
I'm Mrs Hanson. Can I help you?

560
00:48:05,897 --> 00:48:10,114
It's very important I see Burt.
Is he in?

561
00:48:11,027 --> 00:48:14,321
Burt? No, he just left.

562
00:48:15,555 --> 00:48:17,607
Won't you come in?

563
00:48:17,799 --> 00:48:19,805
Thank you.

564
00:48:21,526 --> 00:48:26,495
I'm Virginia Hanson. Did Burt
tell you we were married once?

565
00:48:29,581 --> 00:48:34,551
Oh, I see he didn't.
I'm sorry. He should've told you.

566
00:48:34,586 --> 00:48:36,522
That's just like him.

567
00:48:36,754 --> 00:48:39,684
Did you say you were married to Burt?

568
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:44,850
Up until about a month ago.
That's when I got my final decree.

569
00:48:44,885 --> 00:48:48,941
But Burt doesn't know
anything about that.

570
00:48:52,825 --> 00:48:54,793
You look sick.

571
00:48:54,828 --> 00:48:57,404
Won't you sit down, Mrs Han...?

572
00:49:00,398 --> 00:49:02,688
I'm a little confused.

573
00:49:02,723 --> 00:49:06,585
I know how you feel -
I was married to him, too.

574
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:11,670
You must be mistaken. After all,
his name isn't an unusual one.

575
00:49:13,152 --> 00:49:16,150
Burt couldn't have changed too much.

576
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,745
The younger man is my husband.

577
00:49:31,777 --> 00:49:36,792
The other man is Burt's father.
Did he tell you anything about him?

578
00:49:36,827 --> 00:49:39,795
Only that he died several years ago.

579
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:42,492
I can see he's very much alive.

580
00:49:42,527 --> 00:49:47,747
I bumped into him the other day.
He's in Los Angeles on vacation...

581
00:49:47,782 --> 00:49:51,327
...at the Chaplain Park Hotel,
I think.

582
00:49:51,362 --> 00:49:54,873
Were you...
Were you married in Racine?

583
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:59,914
Why Racine? We're from Chicago.
That's where we were married.

584
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,134
Please bear with me. I...

585
00:50:07,002 --> 00:50:09,182
How long were you married?

586
00:50:09,217 --> 00:50:12,979
Four years.
We went to school together.

587
00:50:13,014 --> 00:50:18,564
Everybody figured we were a natural,
especially Burt's father.

588
00:50:22,441 --> 00:50:24,530
Yet you divorced him.

589
00:50:24,565 --> 00:50:28,327
What would you do?
One day he just walked out.

590
00:50:28,362 --> 00:50:33,469
No goodbye, no nothing. Quit me,
quit his job. We were frantic.

591
00:50:33,504 --> 00:50:36,032
In the meantime we heard about...

592
00:50:36,067 --> 00:50:41,116
...some trouble he got into.
Shoplifting. Just little things.

593
00:50:41,151 --> 00:50:45,050
They came and took back
some presents he'd given me.

594
00:50:45,244 --> 00:50:48,620
We thought divorce
was the only thing.

595
00:50:48,686 --> 00:50:50,703
You keep saying "we".

596
00:50:50,854 --> 00:50:52,863
Burt's father.

597
00:50:52,898 --> 00:50:56,870
He was going crazy.
He made good to the stores.

598
00:50:56,905 --> 00:51:02,160
He's a wonderful man, Burt's father.
He's very kind and considerate.

599
00:51:02,195 --> 00:51:05,126
Obviously you came here for a reason.

600
00:51:05,161 --> 00:51:09,134
Well, yes.
I'd like Burt to sign some papers.

601
00:51:09,169 --> 00:51:13,702
His father gave us some income
property as a wedding gift.

602
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:18,891
I'd like Burt to sign a property
settlement. I'm sure he won't mind.

603
00:51:18,926 --> 00:51:24,046
The envelope is addressed to me
at some friends'. If you'd mail it.

604
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,525
I'll see that he gets them.

605
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,693
I hope there won't be any trouble.

606
00:51:27,769 --> 00:51:29,775
There won't be.

607
00:51:33,974 --> 00:51:36,630
Thank you again. I appreciate it.

608
00:51:39,184 --> 00:51:41,270
I'm sorry...

609
00:51:41,388 --> 00:51:42,961
Well...

610
00:51:44,033 --> 00:51:47,840
How did you find out
about Burt and me?

611
00:51:48,762 --> 00:51:54,120
Well, we had one of those agencies.
They traced him to the army...

612
00:51:54,155 --> 00:51:59,478
...to Tijuana and then you. That's
when we got the newspaper clipping.

613
00:52:01,386 --> 00:52:06,446
You just can't believe a word he
says. That's what the police said.

614
00:52:07,647 --> 00:52:09,726
He just lies.

615
00:52:09,761 --> 00:52:12,610
Well, thanks again.

616
00:52:14,019 --> 00:52:16,584
I know how you must feel.

617
00:53:18,499 --> 00:53:23,354
You make me feel that I'm the one
who has to ask for forgiveness.

618
00:53:23,389 --> 00:53:28,112
You're right. Put me in
the debit side, my name in red ink.

619
00:53:28,307 --> 00:53:33,778
I admit it. I am a self-educated
failure. I don't know what to do.

620
00:53:33,813 --> 00:53:37,379
To do or not to do,
that is the question.

621
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:41,313
I could spend every night
reading the classics.

622
00:53:41,502 --> 00:53:45,274
But the problem is
what to do about Burt.

623
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:50,108
I'm ready to serve your
best interests and help save Burt.

624
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:54,212
What is it
Burt needs to be saved from?

625
00:53:54,247 --> 00:53:55,568
I didn't mean to upset you.

626
00:53:55,618 --> 00:53:58,343
Well, I am upset. I'm his wife.

627
00:53:58,378 --> 00:54:00,544
If you're the father...

628
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,333
Forgive me, Mr Hanson.

629
00:54:03,348 --> 00:54:07,359
No, no, no.
You're right to protect him.

630
00:54:08,192 --> 00:54:13,286
You're more than a good wife.
You're like a friend and a mother.

631
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:21,301
I envy Burt, having you
to help snap him out of it.

632
00:54:21,336 --> 00:54:27,833
But let's take my position.
Like in the storybooks,
we have a hero and a heroine.

633
00:54:27,868 --> 00:54:33,322
But I'm not your villain.
What I am we'll let the gods decide.

634
00:54:33,357 --> 00:54:36,647
But I carry the memory
of a nightmare.

635
00:54:36,845 --> 00:54:42,498
Burt is - or was -
capable of lying about anything.

636
00:54:42,533 --> 00:54:45,425
I was sad to learn the real facts.

637
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:49,951
That's why I'm so glad you say
this is all part of the past.

638
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:52,879
When did it... this lying, start?

639
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:54,843
Does it matter?

640
00:54:54,878 --> 00:54:57,283
It might help to tell us why he lied.

641
00:54:57,329 --> 00:54:58,485
Must you have excuses for him?

642
00:54:58,525 --> 00:55:01,581
I'm looking for an explanation.

643
00:55:01,771 --> 00:55:06,786
To find out that your only son
is a deadbeat, a liar, a thief!

644
00:55:06,821 --> 00:55:09,109
But he's not like that now.

645
00:55:09,144 --> 00:55:12,891
He has a good job
and he's had a promotion.

646
00:55:12,926 --> 00:55:16,639
Says he has.
- If he says he has, th...!

647
00:55:19,084 --> 00:55:22,975
If it makes you feel better
to think that...

648
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:26,867
Have you been to the store?
Have you seen him?

649
00:55:28,421 --> 00:55:33,390
Look... I'd like to believe
he's everything you say he is but...

650
00:55:35,314 --> 00:55:38,405
My son is no good.

651
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:41,009
That's his past record.

652
00:55:41,044 --> 00:55:44,669
I put trust in such records.
He was...

653
00:55:44,704 --> 00:55:47,977
...he still might be a lost soul.

654
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:52,634
If he is...
no-one is going to save him.

655
00:55:52,669 --> 00:55:54,597
Not anyone.

656
00:55:57,525 --> 00:56:00,328
Still you have faith in him.

657
00:56:01,403 --> 00:56:03,341
Someone should.

658
00:56:03,376 --> 00:56:07,828
You've been very kind
to let me come talk to you.

659
00:56:07,863 --> 00:56:12,280
Well, I... I hope to see you again
while I'm here.

660
00:56:13,675 --> 00:56:16,160
Burt will want to see you.

661
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:20,011
If that's what he wants,
I want it too.

662
00:56:20,046 --> 00:56:24,612
It's a father's duty
to be concerned about his son.

663
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:29,178
But what he ought to do, I think,
is go to a hospital.

664
00:56:29,213 --> 00:56:32,114
You haven't heard one word I've said.

665
00:56:32,149 --> 00:56:38,725
We'll see.
But maybe you can give him
enough help and strength yourself.

666
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:42,368
I certainly hope so,
for both of you.

667
00:56:56,635 --> 00:57:00,088
Yes. Yeah, send up some ice, too.

668
00:57:00,562 --> 00:57:02,571
406.

669
00:57:02,606 --> 00:57:06,538
Did she give you a bad time,
Mr Hanson?

670
00:57:06,573 --> 00:57:10,631
That's quite a hunk of woman
Burt's got himself.

671
00:57:10,666 --> 00:57:13,950
I wonder how he managed to get her.

672
00:57:13,985 --> 00:57:17,199
She could also
make things difficult.

673
00:57:17,234 --> 00:57:21,324
But she might be
too shrewd for her own good.

674
00:57:22,804 --> 00:57:27,500
Isn't that her problem and his,
not ours?

675
00:57:57,027 --> 00:58:00,435
Milly, dear? Hanson here!

676
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:02,372
Hi, hon!

677
00:58:02,407 --> 00:58:08,699
Picked up so much stuff
for dinner, I had to buy
a shopping bag to carry it all.

678
00:58:08,734 --> 00:58:12,421
I stopped at that
new delicatessen on Wilshire.

679
00:58:12,456 --> 00:58:16,878
What are your feelings
about salami and garlic pickle?

680
00:58:17,986 --> 00:58:20,437
And some beer, too.

681
00:58:26,722 --> 00:58:30,666
Sit down and relax
like the rich folk.

682
00:58:30,701 --> 00:58:31,982
Can I fix you a drink?

683
00:58:32,015 --> 00:58:34,022
No, thanks.

684
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:37,593
Oh, uh, I brought you something.

685
00:58:37,642 --> 00:58:40,633
Do you remember saying you wouldn't?

686
00:58:40,668 --> 00:58:45,056
I got it just before we closed.
No time for a giftwrap.

687
00:58:45,091 --> 00:58:47,326
I'll open it after dinner.

688
00:58:49,124 --> 00:58:51,141
What's wrong?

689
00:58:53,142 --> 00:58:55,541
Did I forget something?

690
00:58:55,576 --> 00:59:01,196
Why didn't you tell me? Can't you
trust me? I'm entitled to the truth.

691
00:59:01,828 --> 00:59:03,799
What's happened?

692
00:59:11,656 --> 00:59:14,232
Were you at the store today?

693
00:59:14,421 --> 00:59:17,225
Yes, I was at the store today.

694
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:21,597
Oh.

695
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:23,778
I saw you behind the counter.

696
00:59:23,789 --> 00:59:25,768
That's very pretty.

697
00:59:25,803 --> 00:59:27,335
My own wife spying on me!

698
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:29,685
But I had to!

699
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,648
I had to find out.

700
00:59:31,683 --> 00:59:35,426
What disguise did you wear?
A trusting wife?

701
00:59:35,461 --> 00:59:41,000
Did you tell the FBI your husband
wasn't a manager but a tie salesman?

702
00:59:41,732 --> 00:59:45,419
Or did you photograph me
at the scene of the crime...?

703
00:59:45,436 --> 00:59:47,408
Burt, stop it!

704
00:59:48,605 --> 00:59:51,886
It... It wasn't nice of me.

705
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:56,708
It was an indecent thing
for me to do. But I had to find out.

706
00:59:59,255 --> 01:00:01,796
Milly...

707
01:00:01,989 --> 01:00:04,279
Oh, Milly, I...

708
01:00:04,314 --> 01:00:10,412
No matter what you think of me,
I love you and I wouldn't hurt you
for anything.

709
01:00:10,447 --> 01:00:13,206
Burt, why did you have to pretend?

710
01:00:13,241 --> 01:00:17,379
I didn't marry you because I thought
you'd be president of the store.

711
01:00:17,424 --> 01:00:19,427
All right, forget it.

712
01:00:19,462 --> 01:00:23,189
Forget it?
What about all those presents?

713
01:00:23,224 --> 01:00:25,493
I wanted to be a thoughtful husband.

714
01:00:25,593 --> 01:00:28,489
Even if it meant stealing them?

715
01:00:30,362 --> 01:00:34,215
No, Milly. I signed for them.

716
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:37,221
They wouldn't let you on your salary.

717
01:00:37,256 --> 01:00:41,268
You could be arrested!
Don't you understand that?

718
01:00:41,303 --> 01:00:46,193
They've all got to go back -
the portable bar, the radio.

719
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:48,444
Everything.

720
01:00:51,202 --> 01:00:53,207
All right.

721
01:00:54,969 --> 01:00:59,505
All right.
I'll take 'em back in the morning.

722
01:01:00,218 --> 01:01:06,920
And then everything'll be all right.
We can forget about it,
can't we, Milly? Can't we?

723
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:16,692
Isn't there anything else
you want to tell me?

724
01:01:16,727 --> 01:01:18,993
What is this, a third degree?!

725
01:01:19,059 --> 01:01:23,916
Burt, what about the past?
What happened before you met me?

726
01:01:23,951 --> 01:01:28,072
I have no past.
My life began the night I met you.

727
01:01:29,753 --> 01:01:32,455
I wish it were as easy as that.

728
01:01:32,999 --> 01:01:35,484
Virginia was here today.

729
01:01:36,445 --> 01:01:37,378
Virginia?!

730
01:01:37,415 --> 01:01:41,041
Why didn't you tell me
you were married before?

731
01:01:41,076 --> 01:01:44,626
I'd forgotten about it.
It isn't important.

732
01:01:44,661 --> 01:01:49,551
Isn't important - marriage, divorce?
You can't forget about them!

733
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:54,426
You didn't know Virginia
had divorced you when you married me.

734
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:59,338
You go around in a dream world
remembering only what you want to!

735
01:01:59,373 --> 01:02:04,215
You're the only thing that's
real to me. Nothing else matters.

736
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:08,990
I'm your wife. You have
a responsibility to our marriage.

737
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:10,389
I have a right to know.

738
01:02:10,408 --> 01:02:12,435
Yes. I never...

739
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:15,410
I never loved her like I love you.

740
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:19,288
I'm glad, and I'm sure that's true.

741
01:02:19,323 --> 01:02:21,209
But you still have to tell me.

742
01:02:21,265 --> 01:02:22,611
Tell you what?

743
01:02:22,621 --> 01:02:26,144
Everything!
Let me help decide what's right.

744
01:02:26,335 --> 01:02:28,398
Burt?

745
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:34,127
Burt. Look, the present is made up
of little bits of the past.

746
01:02:34,162 --> 01:02:40,738
You can't throw it out of your mind
like something worthless.
You must tell me. Please.

747
01:02:40,773 --> 01:02:45,182
She was my first girl, that's all,
the one I told you about.

748
01:02:45,217 --> 01:02:49,556
After you got married,
what happened? Did you go to work?

749
01:02:49,591 --> 01:02:56,053
It's ancient history!
So I went to work instead of school.
I needed money for an apartment.

750
01:02:56,088 --> 01:03:01,092
After we saved enough, we went
out looking. Any more questions?

751
01:03:01,127 --> 01:03:05,983
Yes! There are more questions!
Why did you never tell me?

752
01:03:06,018 --> 01:03:09,161
Our house was more a toy house
than a real one.

753
01:03:09,196 --> 01:03:12,304
You sound as if
you never even lived together!

754
01:03:12,353 --> 01:03:16,687
You want all the ugly details?
There's nothing to tell!

755
01:03:16,722 --> 01:03:22,420
So I got an apartment. It had stairs
from the living room to the bedroom.

756
01:03:24,896 --> 01:03:27,746
It just isn't important, Milly.

757
01:03:27,781 --> 01:03:30,596
That's why I never mentioned it.

758
01:03:31,228 --> 01:03:33,598
Don't you see?

759
01:03:35,116 --> 01:03:38,762
I... l-I guess I see.

760
01:03:39,002 --> 01:03:43,083
But wouldn't it be better
to mention it now?

761
01:03:45,495 --> 01:03:48,503
Then we'll never talk about it again.

762
01:03:48,538 --> 01:03:51,395
Wouldn't it be easier that way?

763
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:53,916
Easier for you and for me.

764
01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:57,762
Wouldn't it?

765
01:03:57,797 --> 01:04:02,847
All right, maybe we did get married
but we were just kids.

766
01:04:02,882 --> 01:04:04,816
And then?

767
01:04:04,851 --> 01:04:08,145
And then?
- And then what happened?

768
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:10,226
I'm not sure.

769
01:04:10,261 --> 01:04:12,791
You're not sure about what?

770
01:04:12,826 --> 01:04:17,038
I... I did a crazy thing one day.

771
01:04:17,073 --> 01:04:21,085
I came home at noon
to give her a surprise present...

772
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:24,534
...for our six-month
wedding anniversary.

773
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:27,058
She wasn't expecting me.

774
01:04:27,093 --> 01:04:30,683
I just wanted to surprise her.
I figured...

775
01:04:32,352 --> 01:04:36,718
I don't know what I figured.
I don't know.

776
01:04:36,911 --> 01:04:38,889
You don't know what?

777
01:04:38,924 --> 01:04:44,566
I can remember going up the stairs,
but I can't remember coming down.

778
01:04:44,601 --> 01:04:46,880
What do you remember
at the top of the stairs?

779
01:04:46,901 --> 01:04:47,822
Nothing at all.

780
01:04:47,825 --> 01:04:51,780
Was there someone with Virginia?

781
01:04:51,815 --> 01:04:53,743
No, no, no, Milly!

782
01:04:53,761 --> 01:04:56,315
All right, all right! Sorry!

783
01:04:56,667 --> 01:05:01,568
You're right. If there are things
you don't want to talk about...

784
01:05:01,603 --> 01:05:04,724
...don't even want to
remember them, forget it.

785
01:05:05,845 --> 01:05:07,863
But, darling...

786
01:05:07,898 --> 01:05:12,138
...why did you tell me
your father was dead?

787
01:05:13,298 --> 01:05:15,680
My father?!

788
01:05:15,873 --> 01:05:19,555
I saw him today.
He's out here on vacation.

789
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,488
Well, I just felt he was dead.

790
01:05:27,523 --> 01:05:30,141
I still feel he's dead.

791
01:05:30,701 --> 01:05:34,678
What's everybody
trying to do to me?!

792
01:05:37,032 --> 01:05:39,992
I told him how well you were doing...

793
01:05:40,027 --> 01:05:44,010
...and that you'd see him tomorrow.
I'll go with you.

794
01:05:44,045 --> 01:05:50,860
We'll be busy at the store taking
inventory, and there are all those
things you want me to take back.

795
01:05:50,895 --> 01:05:55,872
There'll be time to see your father.
I'll meet you after work.

796
01:06:10,213 --> 01:06:14,466
Oh, Milly!
I'll do anything you want...

797
01:06:14,501 --> 01:06:16,870
...but please don't ask me
to go to see him.

798
01:06:18,669 --> 01:06:22,829
You must! You must,
for his sake as well as yours.

799
01:06:22,864 --> 01:06:24,846
Burt, look at me.

800
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:29,645
Oh, darling! You can't keep
pretending you haven't got a father.

801
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:33,457
You do have one
and he loves you very much.

802
01:06:36,973 --> 01:06:40,543
Did... Did you say he was alone?

803
01:06:40,578 --> 01:06:44,113
All alone at the Chapman Park Hotel.

804
01:06:48,083 --> 01:06:51,571
All right.
I'll go if you want me to.

805
01:06:51,770 --> 01:06:56,865
I didn't mean to force you.
If I sounded that way, I'm sorry.

806
01:06:58,543 --> 01:07:00,549
I'll go.

807
01:07:04,955 --> 01:07:06,960
If you want me to.

808
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,243
I'd like to see Mr Hanson.

809
01:07:31,278 --> 01:07:37,604
Mr Hanson's suite is 406,
but I think he's out by the pool -
round to your left.

810
01:07:37,639 --> 01:07:40,886
Has Mr Hanson's son
asked for him yet?

811
01:07:40,921 --> 01:07:43,529
No, not since I've come on.

812
01:07:43,564 --> 01:07:45,839
I see. Thank you.

813
01:08:26,278 --> 01:08:29,327
I still say you're getting heavy!

814
01:08:33,118 --> 01:08:36,281
I've lost ten pounds in two weeks.

815
01:08:36,478 --> 01:08:38,491
Come in!

816
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:49,241
Is Mr Hanson in? He's expecting me.

817
01:08:49,276 --> 01:08:51,266
Suite 406.

818
01:08:51,301 --> 01:08:53,257
Thank you.

819
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:14,827
Oh, miss. Weren't you asking
about Mr Hanson's son?

820
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:15,828
Yes.

821
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:20,216
He just went up
to his father's suite - 406.

822
01:10:16,528 --> 01:10:18,928
Burt, did you...?

823
01:10:21,958 --> 01:10:25,894
Milly... take me home... please.

824
01:10:45,568 --> 01:10:47,570
Burt dear, are you ready?

825
01:11:00,088 --> 01:11:02,090
Darling.

826
01:11:03,208 --> 01:11:05,972
I asked you if you were ready.

827
01:11:07,408 --> 01:11:09,373
Ready?

828
01:11:09,408 --> 01:11:14,470
I told you we were going for a walk.
We could use the fresh air.

829
01:11:14,505 --> 01:11:19,533
Come on, darling, you haven't
been out of the house for days.

830
01:11:19,928 --> 01:11:24,456
It'll be good for us
to get out of the house for a change.

831
01:11:41,528 --> 01:11:43,496
I'll be right back.

832
01:11:57,128 --> 01:11:59,096
What do you want?

833
01:11:59,288 --> 01:12:02,300
To see Burt. I still haven't
received those signed papers.

834
01:12:02,337 --> 01:12:04,293
Get away from here!

835
01:12:04,328 --> 01:12:07,058
But what about those papers?

836
01:12:07,093 --> 01:12:09,753
He can't see anybody. He's sick.

837
01:12:09,788 --> 01:12:12,650
When he's well enough
I'll get him to sign the papers.

838
01:12:12,689 --> 01:12:15,653
Hello. Can I be of any help?

839
01:12:15,688 --> 01:12:20,011
Burt's sick, and if he sees you...
Get out of here.

840
01:12:20,046 --> 01:12:21,050
I want to help.

841
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:23,253
You sicken me!

842
01:12:23,288 --> 01:12:25,150
Aren't you being unreasonable?

843
01:12:25,176 --> 01:12:29,978
I haven't the heart left
to be reasonable with you, Mr Hanson.

844
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:32,651
You won't stop me from seeing Burt.

845
01:12:32,686 --> 01:12:33,700
Burt's sick?

846
01:12:33,774 --> 01:12:34,700
Yes.

847
01:12:34,707 --> 01:12:37,573
Sounds like a cheap trick.

848
01:12:37,608 --> 01:12:41,400
I won't have him disturbed.
He's emotionally upset.

849
01:12:41,465 --> 01:12:43,623
Emotionally upset?

850
01:12:43,658 --> 01:12:46,893
He finally cracked up.
I saw it coming.

851
01:12:46,928 --> 01:12:51,342
This demands immediate action
to protect Virginia's rights.

852
01:12:51,377 --> 01:12:52,800
He must sign these papers, now!

853
01:12:52,817 --> 01:12:56,184
Right now,
or I'll have him committed!

854
01:12:56,378 --> 01:13:01,771
Try to stop me and I'll have you put
in jail and him declared incompetent

855
01:13:01,806 --> 01:13:05,226
Will you shut up?!
- I want what's coming to Virginia!

856
01:13:05,378 --> 01:13:09,906
I'm tired of begging
for what's rightfully mine.

857
01:13:10,138 --> 01:13:13,773
The place for him
is an institution!

858
01:13:13,808 --> 01:13:19,587
Put him away in some hospital.
Have some headshrinker work on him.

859
01:13:19,622 --> 01:13:21,000
He should be committed!

860
01:13:21,057 --> 01:13:23,383
You want me to commit him -

861
01:13:23,418 --> 01:13:28,333
...put him away so he can never remind
either of you of your horrible guilt!

862
01:13:28,528 --> 01:13:35,696
You and you committed
the ugliest of all possible sins and
drove him into the state he's in now.

863
01:13:35,888 --> 01:13:39,650
What kind of a woman are you to be
satisfied with only half a man?

864
01:13:39,699 --> 01:13:43,053
He's a saner man than you are!

865
01:13:43,088 --> 01:13:47,548
He's decent and proud!
Can you say the same for yourselves?

866
01:13:47,583 --> 01:13:51,303
Where's your decency?
In what garbage dump?

867
01:13:51,338 --> 01:13:53,650
And where's yours, you tramp?
- I don't have to listen to that!

868
01:13:53,704 --> 01:13:54,950
She's crazy!

869
01:13:54,978 --> 01:13:57,293
Staying with that weakling!

870
01:13:57,328 --> 01:14:01,662
You, his loving fraud of a father!
And you, you slut!

871
01:14:01,697 --> 01:14:04,663
You're both so consumed with evil!

872
01:14:04,698 --> 01:14:08,543
Your filthy souls
are too evil for hell itself!

873
01:14:08,738 --> 01:14:11,411
My attorney will take care of you!

874
01:14:11,618 --> 01:14:15,509
Have him put away
where he belongs!

875
01:14:24,098 --> 01:14:28,865
You know, I, uh...
I was just thinking.

876
01:14:30,818 --> 01:14:35,619
We might rent a car
and drive down to the beach.

877
01:14:35,654 --> 01:14:37,863
Might be fun.

878
01:14:37,898 --> 01:14:39,953
Don't you think so?

879
01:14:39,988 --> 01:14:43,025
Course, we'll still take our walk.

880
01:14:44,458 --> 01:14:47,020
Burt, you're smiling.

881
01:14:47,055 --> 01:14:49,543
I thought of something.

882
01:14:49,578 --> 01:14:54,595
I've been sitting here for a long
time trying to add things up...

883
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:57,569
...and now I know the whole score.

884
01:14:57,604 --> 01:15:00,508
I feel like I've been born again.

885
01:15:01,068 --> 01:15:03,104
Born again?

886
01:15:10,578 --> 01:15:13,900
You conniving tramp!

887
01:15:14,708 --> 01:15:18,348
They couldn't get anywhere with me,
my father and Virginia...

888
01:15:18,538 --> 01:15:21,632
...so they picked you as a partner!

889
01:15:21,667 --> 01:15:23,743
You're in a key spot!

890
01:15:23,778 --> 01:15:28,238
You'll talk me into anything
and then all divide it three ways!

891
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:31,664
Could you for one moment
possibly think...?

892
01:15:31,858 --> 01:15:36,955
That property belonged to my mother
and you're not going to get it!

893
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:39,583
Not you or my father or Virginia!

894
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:43,668
And especially not you!
Because you I can stop personally!

895
01:15:43,828 --> 01:15:48,993
Burt, I wouldn't turn against you
if it meant my life.

896
01:15:49,028 --> 01:15:51,113
You are everything I love.

897
01:15:51,148 --> 01:15:55,171
Trying to get away?
You've made your bed.

898
01:15:55,206 --> 01:15:59,195
Nothing but lies,
turning against me!

899
01:15:59,230 --> 01:16:01,702
You know what you deserve?

900
01:16:19,348 --> 01:16:22,703
That'll teach you. No more lies.

901
01:16:22,738 --> 01:16:27,596
I saw all three of you
through the door, all lovey-dovey.

902
01:16:27,631 --> 01:16:29,583
I knew!

903
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:33,321
Now, get up.
Don't sit there looking innocent.

904
01:16:33,356 --> 01:16:37,024
I told you I knew.
I knew it and now I know it!

905
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:39,919
I know it! You're all against me!

906
01:16:49,868 --> 01:16:52,678
DON'T LOOK AT ME THAT WAY!

907
01:17:13,068 --> 01:17:15,070
Milly!

908
01:17:15,588 --> 01:17:17,590
Milly!

909
01:17:21,828 --> 01:17:24,877
Milly! Please! Forgive me!

910
01:17:27,268 --> 01:17:30,112
I couldn't help it. I was...

911
01:17:31,068 --> 01:17:34,788
I... I'll be all right.

912
01:17:37,468 --> 01:17:39,993
I'll be... all right.

913
01:17:44,668 --> 01:17:46,300
What was they talking about?

914
01:17:46,351 --> 01:17:48,000
Hook shot.

915
01:17:48,081 --> 01:17:50,720
Hey, buddy, watch the thumb.

916
01:17:50,755 --> 01:17:52,738
Yes, Liz.

917
01:17:52,773 --> 01:17:54,721
Hiya, Burt!

918
01:17:56,028 --> 01:17:57,500
Hey, Milly.

919
01:17:57,552 --> 01:17:59,513
Hi.

920
01:17:59,548 --> 01:18:01,550
What did the Doc say
about your hand?

921
01:18:01,607 --> 01:18:03,300
It's almost healed.

922
01:18:03,348 --> 01:18:07,034
Good. And what'd he say about Burt?

923
01:18:07,069 --> 01:18:08,950
Nothing. They haven't met yet.

924
01:18:08,962 --> 01:18:12,830
But he's been coming to your place
to fix up your hand.

925
01:18:12,865 --> 01:18:16,241
He's seen Burt,
but they haven't really met.

926
01:18:22,238 --> 01:18:24,200
How's Mr Hanson?

927
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,733
I thought he was sleeping.

928
01:18:26,768 --> 01:18:32,286
I'm not an expert, but I think
he needs some specialised treatment.

929
01:18:32,321 --> 01:18:34,300
For two weeks I've been coming here-

930
01:18:34,348 --> 01:18:38,833
I'm grateful, Doctor,
but I couldn't get away from my work.

931
01:18:38,868 --> 01:18:43,328
Yet when I've seen your husband,
I don't think he's ever seen me.

932
01:18:43,363 --> 01:18:45,283
He's... very troubled.

933
01:18:45,318 --> 01:18:51,359
I hope you'll forgive me
but I've discussed him,
without mentioning any names...

934
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:55,472
...with Dr Couzzens - one of the best
psychiatrists in the country.

935
01:18:55,507 --> 01:18:59,550
I've never had an occasion to know
a psychiatrist and I don't want to.

936
01:18:59,566 --> 01:19:02,353
No-one ever wants to.

937
01:19:02,388 --> 01:19:07,485
But if you need one here's Couzzens'
address. Call him when you wish.

938
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,433
Thank you.

939
01:19:09,468 --> 01:19:11,523
I'd suggest soon.

940
01:19:11,558 --> 01:19:15,551
If that isn't better by Thursday,
call me.

941
01:19:15,586 --> 01:19:17,550
Good night, Doctor.

942
01:19:18,398 --> 01:19:20,400
Good night, Mrs Hanson.

943
01:19:24,558 --> 01:19:28,278
Hey!
How about some room service?

944
01:19:28,313 --> 01:19:30,269
All right, B...

945
01:19:35,918 --> 01:19:38,648
Come on, I'm lonely.

946
01:19:40,398 --> 01:19:43,603
My! You look so rested.

947
01:19:43,638 --> 01:19:45,300
Were you talking to somebody?

948
01:19:45,356 --> 01:19:48,041
The doctor. Did you nap well?

949
01:19:48,076 --> 01:19:50,003
Mmm-hmm.

950
01:19:50,038 --> 01:19:52,563
I'll get you a bowl of soup.

951
01:19:52,598 --> 01:19:57,206
Wait, Milly, I think
you got something on your shirt.

952
01:20:06,248 --> 01:20:08,563
Where did that come from?

953
01:20:08,598 --> 01:20:11,403
You must have been practising.

954
01:20:11,438 --> 01:20:16,478
It's a funny thing - like that kiss.
I can't remember when we did it last

955
01:20:16,513 --> 01:20:17,500
Seconds?

956
01:20:17,558 --> 01:20:19,561
Mmm-hmm.

957
01:20:22,718 --> 01:20:25,721
Well, I'll get you the soup.

958
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:28,050
What happened to your hand?

959
01:20:28,081 --> 01:20:31,840
I tried to go in
two different directions at once.

960
01:20:31,875 --> 01:20:35,600
Oh, yeah, I remember.
Let me see your black eye.

961
01:20:35,643 --> 01:20:37,643
Oh, no!

962
01:20:37,678 --> 01:20:42,081
It's fascinating, but only to me.
It changes colour every day.

963
01:20:42,116 --> 01:20:45,563
I'm not going
to take the glasses off.

964
01:20:45,598 --> 01:20:50,319
There's something unladylike
about a black eye on a woman.

965
01:20:50,354 --> 01:20:52,286
I'll get you your soup.

966
01:21:06,398 --> 01:21:10,255
Virginia,
I want to give you a present.

967
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:14,240
Virginia!

968
01:21:17,448 --> 01:21:21,321
Dad! You left the door open!

969
01:21:24,248 --> 01:21:26,648
You've left the door open!

970
01:21:26,683 --> 01:21:28,563
Burt!

971
01:21:30,802 --> 01:21:32,807
I don't wanna go down the stairs!

972
01:21:32,998 --> 01:21:35,762
SOMEBODY HELP ME!

973
01:21:35,958 --> 01:21:38,498
I DON'T UNDERSTAND!

974
01:21:38,533 --> 01:21:41,003
Burt, listen to me!

975
01:21:41,038 --> 01:21:44,769
I'll help you.
I'll show you the way downstairs.

976
01:21:44,804 --> 01:21:46,736
Come with me.

977
01:21:49,358 --> 01:21:53,408
I'll show you the way, darling.
I'll help you.

978
01:21:53,443 --> 01:21:55,843
I'll help, darling.

979
01:21:55,878 --> 01:21:58,893
You'll be all right. Darling!

980
01:21:58,928 --> 01:22:01,288
You'll be all right.

981
01:22:01,598 --> 01:22:03,600
You'll be all right.

982
01:22:11,158 --> 01:22:13,251
Oh, dear God!

983
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:17,807
Dear God, help me!

984
01:22:18,848 --> 01:22:21,973
How quickly
and how easily can he be cured?

985
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:28,210
Quickly and easily? I have
no licence for handing out miracles.

986
01:22:30,036 --> 01:22:34,674
He must be placed in a hospital
where he'll get treatment.

987
01:22:37,429 --> 01:22:40,119
You want me to commit him, too.

988
01:22:40,154 --> 01:22:42,924
Make him a mental patient!

989
01:22:42,959 --> 01:22:47,096
I couldn't do such a horrible thing.
He's like a child.

990
01:22:47,286 --> 01:22:52,083
Yes, like a child with his mother.
But a child has to grow up.

991
01:22:52,118 --> 01:22:56,880
It's terrible enough leaving him
alone for just a few minutes.

992
01:22:57,905 --> 01:23:00,635
You're asking me to commit him.

993
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:06,323
He wouldn't want to live,
knowing all his life
he'd be known as a mental case!

994
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:10,302
Mental disorder is
just another illness.

995
01:23:10,337 --> 01:23:14,496
It won't go away if you ignore it,
it'll get worse.

996
01:23:15,296 --> 01:23:22,476
I'm talking about his infantilism
and all the other elements
of a schizophrenic pattern.

997
01:23:22,511 --> 01:23:25,248
He's rejected the world around him.

998
01:23:25,283 --> 01:23:30,509
You say he's become unable to make a
decision, he refuses to see anyone,

999
01:23:30,545 --> 01:23:35,736
...his dependence on you - all these
are common symptoms of this illness.

1000
01:23:35,932 --> 01:23:41,904
If I gave him love and understanding,
wouldn't that be sufficient?

1001
01:23:42,103 --> 01:23:48,155
He's getting love and understanding.
What he needs
is expert medical treatment.

1002
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:52,576
He will be able to
accept your love later.

1003
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:57,010
Right now, I see you going to pieces
because of his illness.

1004
01:23:57,045 --> 01:23:58,556
You're offering me
very little choice.

1005
01:23:58,582 --> 01:24:00,952
I'm offering you no choice.

1006
01:24:01,146 --> 01:24:05,602
How can you expect me
to be the one to hurt him?

1007
01:24:05,795 --> 01:24:10,354
I expect you to have
the necessary strength to act.

1008
01:24:10,553 --> 01:24:14,656
It takes great love and mercy
to commit a person...

1009
01:24:14,691 --> 01:24:17,798
...even into the hands of experts.

1010
01:24:17,833 --> 01:24:20,866
I love him, I couldn't do that to him

1011
01:24:20,901 --> 01:24:27,398
You can't go on like this.
You're only helping to destroy him
and yourself.

1012
01:24:27,433 --> 01:24:31,199
He...
he'd be all alone with strangers.

1013
01:24:32,191 --> 01:24:35,211
You see, I'm the only one he trusts.

1014
01:24:36,729 --> 01:24:41,903
If I've sounded harsh or unkind
it's because you're resisting me.

1015
01:24:41,938 --> 01:24:48,799
You mustn't, for your husband's sake
and for your own. He's becoming
a child again. As he disintegrates -

1016
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:52,050
You're deliberately telling me this
to frighten me.

1017
01:24:52,243 --> 01:24:55,126
Deliberately yes, but to advise you.

1018
01:24:55,161 --> 01:25:00,096
Before you throw the ashtray at me -
you don't have to decide right now.

1019
01:25:00,131 --> 01:25:02,059
Watch his behaviour.

1020
01:25:02,094 --> 01:25:06,630
If you see any truth in what
I've said... don't wait too long.

1021
01:25:06,822 --> 01:25:10,116
Doctor - how long would he be away?

1022
01:25:10,188 --> 01:25:15,056
The therapy in a good sanitarium
isn't always a long drawn-out affair

1023
01:25:15,092 --> 01:25:19,926
But be prepared for his being away
and confined for five or six months.

1024
01:25:19,961 --> 01:25:22,695
I know I've upset you, but then...

1025
01:25:22,730 --> 01:25:27,300
...that isn't important, is it?
You're not the patient.

1026
01:25:27,335 --> 01:25:29,281
Or are you?

1027
01:25:30,183 --> 01:25:33,236
I thought you'd get around to that.

1028
01:25:33,272 --> 01:25:36,291
In your world, everyone's crazy.

1029
01:25:37,957 --> 01:25:42,983
As I don't know everyone in my world
I don't feel qualified to answer.

1030
01:25:43,018 --> 01:25:44,934
I'm sorry.

1031
01:25:44,969 --> 01:25:47,499
We're used to it.

1032
01:25:47,534 --> 01:25:52,343
Look, you've told me all the terrible
things that could happen.

1033
01:25:52,378 --> 01:25:54,460
Is there any hope for Burt?

1034
01:25:54,507 --> 01:25:56,484
Of course.

1035
01:25:56,519 --> 01:25:59,782
We've been getting
remarkable results.

1036
01:25:59,817 --> 01:26:03,006
In most cases, complete recoveries.

1037
01:26:03,041 --> 01:26:07,955
Patients who've had no contact with
reality have become adjusted...

1038
01:26:07,990 --> 01:26:13,027
...and developed new emotional values
enabling them to be - to live again.

1039
01:26:14,541 --> 01:26:16,550
To live again?

1040
01:26:16,585 --> 01:26:19,320
That's like being born again.

1041
01:26:19,355 --> 01:26:21,473
It's quite like that.

1042
01:26:22,335 --> 01:26:26,457
Let's say Burt is as sick
as you make him out to be.

1043
01:26:26,492 --> 01:26:31,507
Let's say that he does go to
the sanitarium and that he's cured.

1044
01:26:31,621 --> 01:26:34,459
Well, the question is...

1045
01:26:35,338 --> 01:26:42,392
...might he come out not...
not needing me, not loving me?
That is possible, isn't it?

1046
01:26:42,427 --> 01:26:44,875
I can't be dogmatic.

1047
01:26:45,486 --> 01:26:48,015
One thing, however, is obvious.

1048
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:53,177
He married you because of many needs
interwoven with his neurosis.

1049
01:26:53,212 --> 01:26:58,305
If you remove the neurosis you might
also remove his feeling for you.

1050
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:00,677
He wouldn't have those needs.

1051
01:27:00,712 --> 01:27:04,998
He shouldn't have
those neurotic needs if he's well.

1052
01:27:05,033 --> 01:27:07,087
Am I a neurotic need?

1053
01:27:14,096 --> 01:27:16,897
What you're trying to tell me is...

1054
01:27:16,932 --> 01:27:19,699
...if Burt is cured I might lose him.

1055
01:27:19,906 --> 01:27:22,275
The possibility exists.

1056
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:27,610
Would you rather keep Burt as your
husband, let him become a psychotic

1057
01:27:27,645 --> 01:27:29,651
...and ruin your lives?

1058
01:27:29,844 --> 01:27:36,876
Or have him return to a happy,
normal life, even if it might mean
losing him yourself?

1059
01:27:37,577 --> 01:27:42,387
Do you really think any woman in love
could answer that question?

1060
01:28:14,803 --> 01:28:19,532
Burt, you've got to stop it.

1061
01:28:21,134 --> 01:28:24,303
Burt... can you hear me?

1062
01:29:09,259 --> 01:29:11,267
Dr Couzzens?

1063
01:29:11,302 --> 01:29:15,519
This is... Mrs Hanson.

1064
01:29:29,815 --> 01:29:32,436
This is nice and hot.

1065
01:29:34,513 --> 01:29:39,482
Milly, you'd never leave me.

1066
01:29:39,517 --> 01:29:41,410
Would you?

1067
01:29:41,445 --> 01:29:45,411
Darling, I want you
to remember one thing...

1068
01:29:45,446 --> 01:29:48,273
...and please try to remember it...

1069
01:29:48,308 --> 01:29:51,100
...I love you with all my heart.

1070
01:29:51,135 --> 01:29:53,474
But you'd never leave me.

1071
01:29:53,509 --> 01:29:55,472
Would you, Milly?

1072
01:29:58,906 --> 01:30:01,687
Look, whatever happens...

1073
01:30:04,286 --> 01:30:07,340
Milly!
- Burt, you've got to trust me.

1074
01:30:07,375 --> 01:30:09,906
Don't let them take me away.

1075
01:30:10,136 --> 01:30:13,612
I'll be good,
I'll do anything you say...

1076
01:30:15,145 --> 01:30:17,623
I didn't do anything, I'm all right.

1077
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:19,908
Burt, it's for your good.

1078
01:30:20,063 --> 01:30:22,285
Trust me, darling.

1079
01:30:22,478 --> 01:30:27,641
Take it easy.
- I didn't do anything wrong!
I didn't do anything wrong!

1080
01:30:28,849 --> 01:30:33,692
You did this! I'll get you!
YOU! I'll get you!

1081
01:30:33,888 --> 01:30:36,267
I'll cut your guts out!

1082
01:30:36,302 --> 01:30:40,393
I love you.
- I didn't do anything wrong!

1083
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:43,268
I won't listen.

1084
01:30:43,279 --> 01:30:47,245
I'll get you!
I didn't do anything wrong!

1085
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:51,930
I didn't do anything wrong!
I didn't do anything wrong!

1086
01:31:27,511 --> 01:31:32,482
'Therapy in a good sanitarium isn't
always a long, drawn out procedure...

1087
01:31:32,517 --> 01:31:37,454
...but be prepared for him being away
and confined for five or six months'

1088
01:31:37,489 --> 01:31:41,017
'Five or six months.
Five or six months.'

1089
01:31:53,237 --> 01:31:59,984
"When you remove that neurosis
you might also remove
the feeling he has for you."

1090
01:32:42,454 --> 01:32:45,178
'Don't let them take me away.'

1091
01:32:45,213 --> 01:32:47,177
'You must trust me.'

1092
01:32:47,212 --> 01:32:49,708
'Please. Look, no, I'll be good.'

1093
01:32:49,743 --> 01:32:51,701
'It's for your own good.'

1094
01:32:51,736 --> 01:32:53,592
'Help me! '

1095
01:34:27,318 --> 01:34:32,332
Where you been? I've been waiting
all day and half the night.

1096
01:34:32,367 --> 01:34:34,295
I was walking.

1097
01:34:34,330 --> 01:34:36,939
A fine time to be walking.

1098
01:34:36,975 --> 01:34:39,550
It came. A letter from Burt.

1099
01:34:48,355 --> 01:34:51,363
What's wrong? Milly, what's wrong?

1100
01:34:52,562 --> 01:34:56,369
It isn't from Burt,
it's from the sanitarium.

1101
01:34:56,404 --> 01:34:59,539
Burt will be discharged next Friday.

1102
01:34:59,574 --> 01:35:03,381
They asked that I come up to...
bring him home.

1103
01:35:03,416 --> 01:35:05,991
That's good! Ain't that good?

1104
01:35:06,026 --> 01:35:07,964
Why me?

1105
01:35:07,999 --> 01:35:09,958
Why should I go?

1106
01:35:09,993 --> 01:35:13,143
They ought to know by now he doesn't
want me, doesn't need me any more.

1107
01:35:13,366 --> 01:35:15,578
It's not so definite.

1108
01:35:15,613 --> 01:35:16,649
The question's still open.

1109
01:35:16,694 --> 01:35:20,456
He never wrote me, never asked for me

1110
01:35:20,491 --> 01:35:24,218
He's been sick.
You've said it a thousand times.

1111
01:35:24,253 --> 01:35:26,186
Give him a break.

1112
01:35:26,221 --> 01:35:29,036
Now he's better, help him once more.

1113
01:35:29,071 --> 01:35:31,555
Help him to do what?

1114
01:35:31,711 --> 01:35:34,491
What should I do, go and act casual?

1115
01:35:34,526 --> 01:35:39,928
"Hello, Burt darling. It's so good to
see you again! You're looking well."

1116
01:35:39,963 --> 01:35:41,904
Then what do I do?

1117
01:35:41,939 --> 01:35:46,304
Beg him to come home?
And when he says no, what do I do?

1118
01:35:46,339 --> 01:35:50,038
Smile sadly
and walk away into the sunset?

1119
01:35:50,073 --> 01:35:55,020
You've got to go. It's not making it
any easier torturing yourself.

1120
01:35:55,055 --> 01:35:59,967
You're the only one who can find out
how he feels. Nobody can help you.

1121
01:36:00,002 --> 01:36:03,619
Why can't they?
When do I get my turn?

1122
01:36:03,654 --> 01:36:06,432
Everybody needs help, don't they?

1123
01:36:07,013 --> 01:36:09,019
I need help, too.

1124
01:36:10,108 --> 01:36:13,721
Maybe I don't want
to find out how he feels.

1125
01:36:13,756 --> 01:36:16,244
Being in love is never easy.

1126
01:36:16,279 --> 01:36:22,046
The more in love you are, the less
easy and more lonesome it gets.

1127
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:27,141
You're talking to an expert
on being lonely. Remember?

1128
01:36:30,424 --> 01:36:31,782
Burt's bound to be grateful.

1129
01:36:31,837 --> 01:36:36,795
I don't want him back because
he's grateful and obligated and I...

1130
01:36:36,831 --> 01:36:40,364
I can't take being hurt any more.

1131
01:36:49,969 --> 01:36:51,416
And how does your garden grow?

1132
01:36:51,461 --> 01:36:53,513
Hi, Miss Evans.

1133
01:36:53,705 --> 01:36:58,754
You look prettier every day. How do
you do it in that cast-iron uniform?

1134
01:36:58,789 --> 01:37:01,734
I need it to protect me
from the eyes of certain patients.

1135
01:37:01,762 --> 01:37:03,728
You're crazy.

1136
01:37:03,763 --> 01:37:06,613
Who isn't?
- That's right.

1137
01:37:06,648 --> 01:37:10,455
Hey, I'm not.
They may be but I'm not.

1138
01:37:10,490 --> 01:37:11,852
What makes you so sure?

1139
01:37:11,890 --> 01:37:14,626
I hear they're getting rid of me.

1140
01:37:14,702 --> 01:37:21,723
What a thing to do to a perfectly
normal guy, take him away from
everything he's gotten used to.

1141
01:37:21,758 --> 01:37:25,202
We're not running a hotel.
We need the bed space.

1142
01:37:25,237 --> 01:37:27,179
There are other nuts here?

1143
01:37:27,206 --> 01:37:31,978
Please, some of my best friends
are in joints like this.

1144
01:37:32,013 --> 01:37:39,831
Anyway, you're getting your
walking papers and diploma today.
Now how does your garden grow?

1145
01:37:39,866 --> 01:37:44,443
With silver bells and cockle shells
and very pretty maids.

1146
01:37:50,445 --> 01:37:55,744
It's routine to ask the nearest
relative to come on graduation day.

1147
01:38:06,313 --> 01:38:10,803
Don't bother to introduce us.
Mrs Hanson and I've already met.

1148
01:38:11,602 --> 01:38:13,415
Goodbye.

1149
01:38:15,419 --> 01:38:17,267
Hello, Burt.

1150
01:38:17,302 --> 01:38:20,263
I spoke to the head of the sanitarium

1151
01:38:20,298 --> 01:38:27,638
He said you'd told Virginia and your
father to stay out of your life, that
they could have the signed papers.

1152
01:38:27,831 --> 01:38:32,444
But I'm part of your past, too.
You didn't say goodbye to me.

1153
01:38:32,479 --> 01:38:37,266
You need this chance to cut yourself
off from all things past, even me.

1154
01:38:37,301 --> 01:38:41,471
I know you're angry with me
for sending you here.

1155
01:38:41,506 --> 01:38:45,642
It isn't very nice to be sent off
to a sanitarium.

1156
01:38:45,677 --> 01:38:49,234
It's unpleasant and cruel, very cruel

1157
01:38:49,429 --> 01:38:52,770
But if you'd cut yourself
and were bleeding...

1158
01:38:52,805 --> 01:38:58,010
...I would have done anything to stop
the bleeding even if it was cruel.

1159
01:38:58,045 --> 01:39:03,216
Please don't worry... the important
thing is that you're well again.

1160
01:39:03,414 --> 01:39:07,038
I told you once I wasn't good
at small talk.

1161
01:39:07,073 --> 01:39:09,790
And here I am making small talk.

1162
01:39:09,825 --> 01:39:15,398
I guess I'm... I'm sorry, Burt,
I'm just a little nervous about...

1163
01:39:15,996 --> 01:39:19,537
I... I'm not feeling sorry for myself.

1164
01:39:19,572 --> 01:39:22,968
You're free to make
any choice you wish.

1165
01:39:23,003 --> 01:39:25,463
I won't hold it against you.

1166
01:39:25,498 --> 01:39:27,431
Not for very long.

1167
01:39:27,466 --> 01:39:31,227
I've told myself
life isn't one long honeymoon.

1168
01:39:31,263 --> 01:39:36,049
People have to grow up
and get happiness like real adults.

1169
01:39:36,552 --> 01:39:38,731
About your clothes -

1170
01:39:38,766 --> 01:39:42,139
...just leave a forwarding address.

1171
01:39:44,326 --> 01:39:47,633
Miss Evans is a pretty young girl.

1172
01:39:47,668 --> 01:39:50,942
A nurse too. No Miss Bubble-Gummer.

1173
01:39:50,977 --> 01:39:53,752
Or Miss Jitterbug. Or is she?

1174
01:39:57,759 --> 01:40:01,166
Well, I guess
that takes care of everything.

1175
01:40:01,201 --> 01:40:04,379
So I'll wish you luck and say goodbye

1176
01:40:12,896 --> 01:40:14,514
Milly...

1177
01:40:14,549 --> 01:40:16,600
...let me see your hand.

1178
01:40:17,474 --> 01:40:19,322
My hand?

1179
01:40:19,357 --> 01:40:22,491
The one I hurt with the typewriter.

1180
01:40:37,309 --> 01:40:39,634
The scar's almost gone.

1181
01:40:41,797 --> 01:40:45,204
You didn't even give me
a chance to say hello.

1182
01:40:45,239 --> 01:40:47,368
Did you want a chance?

1183
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:51,141
Hello, Milly.

1184
01:41:02,323 --> 01:41:05,387
I think people are staring at us.

1185
01:41:05,422 --> 01:41:08,452
Do you care?
- No, let them.

1186
01:41:08,487 --> 01:41:11,654
# Since you went away

1187
01:41:11,689 --> 01:41:14,823
# The days grow long

1188
01:41:15,696 --> 01:41:18,421
# And soon I'll hear

1189
01:41:18,456 --> 01:41:21,111
# Old winter's song

1190
01:41:21,146 --> 01:41:26,240
# But I'll miss you most of all,
my darling

1191
01:41:26,275 --> 01:41:31,614
# When autumn leaves start to fall #
