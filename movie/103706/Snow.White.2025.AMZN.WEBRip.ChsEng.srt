Once upon a time, there was a peaceful kingdom

The king and queen watched with pride

as Snow White grew into a kind and fair young princess.

But then, tragedy struck.

Snow White's mother fell ill.

And the Good Queen died.

Snow White and the king were heartbroken.

an enchanting woman from a far-off land appeared at the palace.

�����Ǵ͸�������Խƽ���˵�����
to grant her powers beyond the ordinary.

00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,700

She married the king,

but she was not what she appeared.

73
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,660

She was evil

74
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,540

and cared only about her own beauty

and the power it granted.

76
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,620

To protect that power,

77
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,830

she kept a magic mirror

which could answer but one simple question.

who is the fairest of them all?

your beauty is beyond compare.

The new queen wasted no time seizing power.

She warned of a terrible threat from beyond the Southern Kingdom.

But the king did not return.

And the queen's power grew.

She turned the farmers into soldiers

and robbed the riches of the kingdom for herself.

96
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,620

She made Snow White a servant

��ѩ�����Ͳ�����Ϊ�ʺ�ļɶ� ���ܵ��˺�
Snow White remained safe from the queen's cruel jealousy.

You killed him.

You think you want a flower.

But a flower wilts.

A flower cannot keep you safe.

or lead a kingdom.

A flower cannot give you what I can give you.

you would invite the village to come and pick them.

just like your father.

1290
01:34:10,910 --> 01:34:13,540

I said, "Enough!"

There was a time where we lived with hope.

When good things were nurtured and allowed to grow.

Famed is thy beauty.

But it goes no further than the skin.

For Snow White,

1318
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:12,200

beauty comes from deep within.
