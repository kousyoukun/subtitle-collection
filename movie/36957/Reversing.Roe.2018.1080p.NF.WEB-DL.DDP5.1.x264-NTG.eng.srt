3

she loses a part of herself

Most of us want that

that we always know best
for every person, but we do not.

and make it more and more difficult

17
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:22,457
and drive women back into the shadows
of illegal abortions,

18
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,044

[woman] <i>When I started out,</i>

I thought abortion would just be

78
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,782
just like people need hysterectomies,
people need abortions,

79
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,076
and I will take care of my patients
who need those.

80
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:33,041
<i>But I realize that in conservative states</i>
<i>it can be very hard to get an abortion.</i>

<i>I live in Saint Louis, but...</i> <i>three out of four weeks,</i>
<i>I'm traveling somewhere.</i>

we're just gonna let that happen,"

89
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,077

<i>these people out here ask me</i>

95
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:30,223
what my thoughts and opinions
of abortion itself is.

96
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:35,144
And I give 'em the same answer.
"My opinion." I keep it that way.

97
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:39,857
The main reason I'm here is that girl
that flies up there on that flagpole.

98
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,653
What I have against these people
more than anything

99
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,948
is that they keep trying to push
their religion up on someone else

100
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,201
in a nation that's supposed to have
religious freedom.

101
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,622
[Dr. McNicholas] <i>You know, you can think</i>
<i>whatever you want about it.</i>

102

<i>But, in America,</i>

103
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,461
<i>one in four women will have an abortion</i>
<i>in their life.</i>

104
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,590

<i>abortion is just basic health care.</i>

105
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,469
We're gonna remove the pregnancy, okay?

106
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,473
<i>And when I think about</i>
<i>how politicized this has become…</i>

107
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:18,479

[woman] <i>In all the soul-searching</i>
<i>I have done,</i>

109

110
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,244
<i>that they are only disengaging from me…</i>

111
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,705
<i>a kind of mass of tissue.</i>

112
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,001
[woman 2] <i>In the early 1960s,</i>
<i>abortion was illegal.</i>

113
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,629
<i>And there was a woman</i>
<i>named Sherri Finkbine.</i>

114
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:48,509
She was a children's television hostess
in Phoenix.

115
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:49,677
Miss Sherri.

116
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,847
Uh, she had four children,

117
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,184
<i>and she was pregnant</i>
<i>with a much-wanted baby.</i>

118
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,437
<i>But she had taken this drug</i>
<i>called thalidomide.</i>

119
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,650
<i>And she went to her doctor and said,</i>
<i>"What about this?"</i>

120
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,779
And he said, "I recommend
that you have an abortion."

121
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,910
<i>He said, "I can arrange an abortion</i>
<i>for you in the hospital here."</i>

122
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,165
[man] <i>Hospitals did some what they called</i>
<i>"therapeutic abortions,"</i>

123
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,626
<i>only to save the life of women.</i>

124
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,088
But if the doctor wanted to help the woman
out, he would interpret that very broadly.

125
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,883
<i>The woman might say,</i>
<i>"I'm gonna kill myself."</i>

126
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,928
<i>Then he could say, "Her life is at stake."</i>

127
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,098
[man] <i>If therapeutic abortion is done,</i>
<i>it's usually done on the basis</i>

128
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:40,228
of the mental and emotional disturbance
to the patient.

129
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,481
[Rev. Davis] <i>Women had to go before</i>
<i>a committee of male doctors</i>

130
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,649
<i>to ask for an abortion.</i>

131
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,236
<i>And women were often treated</i>
<i>very badly. Like,</i>

132
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:52,073
<i>"Well, we'll do the abortion for you,</i>
<i>but if you agree to be sterilized."</i>

133
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,991
<i>It was a common procedure.</i>

134
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,370
<i>"We don't want to clean up your mess."</i>
<i>They would say things like that.</i>

135
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,831
<i>But if you were a wealthy white woman,</i>

136
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,211
you could probably find a way
to get access to the procedure,

137
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,463
and it would be called
a therapeutic abortion.

138
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,052
[Greenhouse] <i>Sherri had an appointment</i>
<i>at the hospital for the abortion.</i>

139
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,807
<i>And she felt that she had an obligation</i>
<i>to let this be known</i>

140
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,018
<i>so that other women in the same position</i>
<i>would have the same option.</i>

141
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,479
<i>But once the...</i>

142
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,066
<i>the word kind of got out</i>
<i>into the local newspaper,</i>

143
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,027
you know, the hospital said,
"Oh, no, we can't give you an abortion."

144
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,990
<i>She couldn't find a place for an abortion</i>
<i>any place in the country.</i>

145
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,324

[Greenhouse] <i>I just want to do</i>
<i>what's right for myself and my family,</i>

147
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,040
and I don't feel bitter towards people
who oppose this religiously.

148
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,460
I think we're doing the right thing.
I'd like to really emphasize.

149
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,671
We're not making a decision
for other people.

150
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,592
This is right for our family
and in our particular case.

151
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,012
This became a big story.
It was in <i>Life </i>magazine.

152
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,433
I remember as a very young kid reading it
and thinking, "Hmm, what's this about?"

153
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,102
<i>So, it focused people's attention.</i>

154
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:14,530
[woman] <i>If you were pregnant and did not</i>
<i>want to be, in the '50s and '60s,</i>

155

<i>you had very few options.</i>

156
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,120
<i>So, if you didn't want to have a child,</i>

157
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,249
either you were lucky enough to have
a family doctor who would help you,

158
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,879
or to have enough money to go
to Puerto Rico or some other country,

159
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,757
<i>where you could get an abortion.</i>

160
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,637
<i>After I graduated from college,</i>
<i>I was pregnant</i>

161

<i>I didn't know what to do and...</i>

162
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:47,313
<i>was terrified. And I found a doctor</i>
<i>in the phone book in London.</i>

163
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,608
<i>And he said, "Promise me two things.</i>

164
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,861
<i>One, you will not tell anyone my name.</i>

165
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,531
And two, you will do what you want
to do with your life."

166
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,911
<i>And I'm grateful to him to this day.</i>

167
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,584
[Rev. Davis]
<i>I didn't know anything about abortion</i>

168
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,796
<i>until I became the chaplain</i>
<i>at Skidmore College in 1966.</i>

169
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,258
<i>And I told my wife at one point,</i>
<i>I said, "You know, 1,400 young women.</i>

170
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,094
What kind of problems could they have?"

171
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,721
And she said, "You're a dope.
You're gonna find out."

172
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,015
<i>Students who were pregnant,</i>

173
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,267
<i>but didn't want to tell their families,</i>
<i>would come to me.</i>

174
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,271
<i>And I'd send the student</i>
<i>to a doctor in Schenectady,</i>

175
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,774
<i>who always found it necessary</i>
<i>to do an abortion.</i>

176
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,152
<i>And that's how I learned</i>
<i>that I wasn't just a chaplain.</i>

177
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,238
I learned I was an abortion counselor.

178
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:42,618
<i>There were many other college chaplains</i>

186
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:04,265
<i>We would not ask them why they were having</i>
<i>the abortion. That was not our business.</i>

187
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:08,102
But most of the women wanted to talk
about it. They wanted to tell me why.

188
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,814
And so it was quite an education
for a young male minister

189
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,274
into the lives of women.

190
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:19,697

207
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:33,562

down stairs.

209

222

<i>about something</i>
<i>that only happened to women,</i>

224

227

233
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,906
[Steinem] <i>The issue is</i>
<i>reproductive freedom,</i>

Something really profound is happening.

<i>We were the party</i>
<i>that believed in individual liberty.</i>

307
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,119
[reporter] Congratulations.

308
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,788
<i>[Meliche] Governor Rockefeller</i>
<i>was pro-choice.</i>

309
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:25,956
One more committee...

310
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,875
And we felt, "Why should the state

311
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,752
be telling women whether or not
they could have an abortion?"

312
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,755
<i>Rockefeller vetoed the bill…</i>

313
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,137
<i>and abortion stayed legal in New York.</i>

314
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,393
There was a Gallup poll
in the summer of 1972

315
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,563
that asked people to answer the question,

316
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:53,984
"Do you believe that abortion should be
a matter between a woman and her doctor?"

317
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:58,572
<i>Republicans by about two-thirds</i>
<i>said yes to that question,</i>

318
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:02,284
<i>"Abortion should be a matter left</i>
<i>to a woman and her doctor."</i>

319
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,536
<i>Not the government.</i>

320
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,303
[man] <i>I think I'm probably</i>
<i>the oldest provider</i>

321
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,180
<i>of abortion services in the country.</i>

322
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,810
<i>I did my first abortion in 1967.</i>

323
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,395
<i>Illegal abortion.</i>

324
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:37,110
<i>The Clergy Consultation called,</i>
<i>and they asked me,</i>

325
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:41,406
<i>"Curtis, would you</i>
<i>consider doing abortions?"</i>

326
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,243
Do you have any problems
you want to discuss with me?

327
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,953
<i>So, that's where it started.</i>

328
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,124
<i>And I thought I could go to prison,</i>
<i>I could lose my medical license.</i>

329
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,837
<i>And I grew up religious.</i>
<i>I became an ordained minister</i>

330
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,589
<i>my senior year in high school.</i>

331
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,636
<i>And I think the basic Christian teaching</i>
<i>is compassion and service.</i>

332
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,307
My head and my heart and my hands
said to do this. I can make a difference,

333
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,851
and I'm going take the risk.

334
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,982
<i>I've done this work ever since.</i>

335
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:20,195
<i>I'm now 80 years old.</i>
<i>And after 80 years, I've decided</i>

336
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:24,074
I'm not moving on to another career.
I think this is it.

337
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,450
I mean, I'm still needed.

338
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,455
[woman] <i>Thank you for calling</i>
<i>the Southwestern Women's Surgery Center.</i>

339
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,832
I'm Alicia. How may I help you?

340
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,586
Okay. I have availability
for tomorrow afternoon...

341
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,426
[Dr. Boyd] <i>I've been urged by people</i>
<i>to pass on</i>

342
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,803
<i>what I have learned and experienced.</i>

343
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:48,890
<i>So, that's what I'm doing, trying to teach</i>
<i>as many young doctors as I can.</i>

344
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,976
…dilate carefully…

345
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,396
<i>My philosophy is that the goal</i>
<i>in providing abortions</i>

346
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:58,900
<i>is to assist the woman in making</i>
<i>the best decision she can</i>

347
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,569
for her and her life...

348
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,821
in whatever that takes.

349
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:09,870
[man] <i>The most important moral question of</i>
<i>the abortion debate</i>

350
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,289
<i>is what is in the womb?</i>

351
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:16,835
<i>Is it a person? Does it deserve our</i>
<i>moral attention and protection or not?</i>

352
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,337
<i>That is the most important question.</i>

353
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,590
<i>In the pro-life movement,</i>
<i>we're outraged, because we believe</i>

354
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,800
<i>that elective abortion is</i>

355
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,761
the taking of an innocent human life.

356
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,514
That is an act of injustice that
we can stop and we need to stop.

357
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,100
-This is Doctor Boyd.
-Dr. Boyd.

358
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,936
If you have questions,
we want you to let us know.

359
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,981
And we'll take good care of you
and make this...

360
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,442
Women continue a pregnancy
and have a baby,

361
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,986
because they want a baby at that time.

362
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,990
<i>And they have an abortion</i>
<i>because they don't want to be pregnant</i>

363
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,659
<i>at that time in their life</i>
<i>for their own sufficient reasons.</i>

364
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,620
[Dr. Boyd] The state of Texas requires

365
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:55,957
that you be seen at least 24 hours
before your abortion.

366
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,127
And then I'm gonna show you
this sonogram.

367
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,838
[woman] That looks like
between five and six weeks, okay?

368
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:06,468
Sonogram technology is one of the best
friends of the pro-life movement.

369
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:11,264
It is changing a generation's mind about
what's going on in the womb of a woman.

370
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:15,394
<i>It is very common for expecting mothers</i>
<i>to have sonograms</i>

371
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:19,773
<i>on their fridge for children to know what</i>
<i>that picture is. That is their sibling.</i>

372
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:23,652
<i>And so this was a great tool that we</i>
<i>wanted to tap into and to use,</i>

373
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:27,489
<i>and we saw that abortion clinics</i>
<i>were already using sonogram technology</i>

374
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,824
<i>before an abortion.</i>

375
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,452
<i>Good morning, everybody.</i>
<i>John Seago with tech...</i>

376
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:36,373
<i>We think very deliberately about what are</i>
<i>we doing that is taking a step forward</i>

377
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,418
<i>to challenging the very foundations</i>
<i>of Roe v. Wade.</i>

378
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:42,504
And the sonogram bill was an important one
because we were pushing how much

379
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,923
<i>we can require a physician to do.</i>

380
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:49,386
All right. So Chapter 171 of the Texas
Health and Safety Code require that

381
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:53,098
I provide you with this information
at least 24 hours prior to your procedure.

382
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:56,017
[Seago] We wanted the sonogram
not just to be performed,

383
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,812
for the sake of the abortionist,
but also to be displayed

384
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,064
for the woman to see.
That was the whole goal.

385
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,774
This little blurry thing right here.

386
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,652
If you focus kind of right there
and you see a little flicker.

387
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:08,113
-Yeah.
-That's the heartbeat. Cardiac activity.

388
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,240
[Dr. Boyd] The law says
a doctor has to describe

389
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,659
what she sees on the screen
to the patient,

390
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,619
giving her a chance to change her mind,

391
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:18,748
to see the error of her ways
and realize what she's about to do.

392
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,417
That's the idea.

393
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:25,046
<i>This is the state</i>
<i>imposing it upon the woman.</i>

394
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,550
She has engaged a doctor
to discuss this with her

395
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,470
and help her come to a resolution.

396
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,014
She did not engage
the legislature of the state of Texas.

397
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,810
[Seago] <i>It is the strong conviction</i>
<i>of Texas Right to Life</i>

398
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:42,022
<i>that the legislature should work</i>
<i>to stop abortions.</i>

399
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:47,110
In the capitol, we have the capacity
to direct the conversation.

400
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:52,657
<i>All elective abortion is a violent act</i>
<i>of injustice and should be rejected.</i>

401
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,950
Hey.

402
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,120
[Seago] If you're running in Texas
as a Republican...

403
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:00,665
An inhumane action
to a human child in the womb.

404
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:04,294
...you have to claim to agree
with pro-life principles.

405
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:08,048
[man] <i>Sid Miller helped pass powerful</i>
<i>legislation to protect the unborn.</i>

406
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,592
Thank you and God bless.

407
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,220
[woman] You can be elected
as agriculture commissioner.

408
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:18,850
You can be elected as the chief financial
officer of our state because of abortion.

409
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,186
Not because of your skills with numbers.

410
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:25,232
We must pass one of the strongest
pieces of pro-life legislation.

411
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,525
<i>But because of your skill</i>

412
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:30,362
<i>at getting legislation passed</i>
<i>to obstruct access to abortion.</i>

413
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:33,240
That's how powerful
this issue is in Texas.

414
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:37,536
That's how powerful pro-life
advocacy groups have become.

415
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:43,375
I signed a sonogram law so mothers facing
that agonizing choice can actually see.

416
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,669
And I know it...

417
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,712
works.

418
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:57,055
We want to see all unborn children
protected, and we believe that

419
00:25:57,138 --> 00:26:00,642
what we've been doing is still
the best way to approach it.

430
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:41,266
<i>But our case was the first</i>
<i>to get to the US Supreme Court.</i>

431
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,770
<i>The law in Texas was that abortion</i>
<i>was illegal,</i>

432
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:50,066
<i>and we had a woman who was</i>
<i>already pregnant who didn't want to be...</i>

433

<i>and she didn't want her name public.</i>

434
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:57,490
<i>So, we thought,</i>
<i>"Well, John Doe, Jane Roe."</i>

435
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,286
<i>And Henry Wade</i>
<i>was the district attorney in Dallas.</i>

436
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:07,667
And it was clear that so many women
were affected by this issue.

437
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:14,549
<i>There was a flight that left Dallas</i>
<i>every Thursday going to California,</i>

438
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:18,011
<i>and there were usually ten</i>
<i>or a few more women on that flight</i>

439
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:22,349
<i>going out to California for abortion.</i>
<i>People were going to Colorado.</i>

440
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,560
<i>And a lot of people</i>
<i>were flying to New York.</i>

441
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:31,733
<i>And there were thousands of women</i>
<i>who had had illegal abortion,</i>

442
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,235
<i>who had done their own abortion.</i>

443
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,238
<i>And so we filed a class action</i>

444
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:42,452
to say that this is a case for all women
who are or might become pregnant

445
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:45,413
and want the option of abortion.

<i>We are not here to advocate abortion.</i>

<i>We do not ask this court to rule</i>
<i>that abortion is good,</i>

<i>or desirable in any particular situation.</i>

00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,590
<i>whether or not an unborn fetus</i>
<i>is a person, isn't it?</i>

462
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,428
[Weddington] <i>At one point</i>
<i>a justice had said to me,</i>

463
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,180
<i>"When do you believe human life begins?"</i>

464
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,599
<i>And I said, "Well, Your Honor,</i>

465
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:50,061
<i>we did not try to say exactly</i>
<i>what moment that was."</i>

466
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,231
<i>There is no one answer to that.</i>

467
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:57,360
<i>Different religions</i>
<i>have different answers to that question,</i>

468
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,405
<i>but there is no legal standard that said,</i>

469
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,616
<i>"At this point the fetus becomes a human."</i>

470
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,287
So, the question is,
who gets to make the decision?

471
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,414
Is it the woman,

472
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,416
or is it the government?

473
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:15,253
And my position has always been
it's not the government.

474
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,756
Good evening. In a landmark ruling,

475
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,092
the Supreme Court today
legalized abortion.

476
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,677
[reporter] <i>The Court split seven to two</i>

477
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,513
<i>with Justices Byron White</i>
<i>and William Rehnquist dissenting.</i>

478
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,808
<i>The decision made abortion</i>
<i>largely a private matter</i>

479
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,603
<i>and ordered the states</i>
<i>to make no laws forbidding it,</i> <i>except possibly during the final months.</i>

480
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,901
When Roe went through,
it was a shock to everyone.

481
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,987
To go so far over to the other side,

482
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,282
to put everything in the woman's hand
and essentially dismantle the laws.

483
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:47,327
Now, in any other state,
you couldn't pass laws against abortion,

484
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,287
not forbidding it directly.

485
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,663
It was a constitutional right.

486
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,875
[Greenhouse] <i>The Roe decision held</i>

487
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,753
<i>that women have the right</i>
<i>to terminate a pregnancy</i>

488
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,671
<i>in the first two trimesters,</i>

489
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,716
<i>and then it's only at the third trimester</i>

490
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,636
<i>that the state has the right</i>
<i>to prohibit abortion</i>

491
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:09,224
<i>except when necessary to preserve</i>
<i>a woman's life or health.</i>

492
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,561
[Wattleton] <i>When the Roe v. Wade decision</i>
<i>was handed down,</i>

493
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:17,607
<i>Planned Parenthood had been devoted</i>
<i>to women's reproductive health</i>

494
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,319
<i>and access to contraception.</i>

495
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:24,197
<i>And the local chapters</i>
<i>had to ask themselves,</i>

496
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,992
<i>"Are we gonna provide abortions</i>
<i>now that they are legal?"</i>

497
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:31,454
It was really a moment of reflection

498
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,832
that was very tough
for the organization.

499
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,667
[woman] March 11th is...

500
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,293
[Rev. Davis] <i>When it first became legal,</i>

501
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,213
<i>Planned Parenthood was not keen</i>
<i>on abortion.</i>

502
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,174
<i>Various affiliates around the country,</i>

503
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:47,095
a lot of them didn't want to do abortions.
They really didn't.

504
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,763
The board would be divided.

505
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,266
Half the people would want to,
the other half wouldn't.

506
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,602
[woman] Now, after the doctor's
examined you and everything is all right,

507
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,314
the first thing he's going to do
is use the speculum. This is the...

508
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:02,360
[Rev. Davis] <i>But one by one,</i>
<i>they swung over to the active side.</i>

509
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:07,365
And when they did, the people who didn't
like abortion would resign from the board

510
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:10,243
and other people would come on,
and it's committed now,

511
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:14,080
<i>committed to this right,</i>
<i>given by the Roe v. Wade decision.</i> [man 1] <i>No court opinion</i>
<i>can change the law of God.</i>

512
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:22,380
Every legal possibility must be explored

513
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:26,217
to challenge the opinion
of the United States Supreme Court.

514
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,387
[man 2] <i>Life begins at conception.</i>

515
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,265
Protect the life of the unborn.

516
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:37,478
So, as long as there was
no New York law or no Roe v. Wade,

517
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,648
<i>the woman was really, you know, an outlaw.</i>

518
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,861
<i>She was moving around, trying to get</i>
<i>some procedure that was against the law.</i>

519
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,113
<i>And nobody really tried</i>
<i>to stop her very much.</i>

520
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,408
<i>But when the Court said,</i>

521
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:54,787
<i>"You have the right to make this decision.</i>
<i>You have the right to define your life.</i>

522
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,372
Not religion."

523
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:01,127
That was unacceptable.

524
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,340
Get out!

525
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,383
There won't be any murder here today.

526
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,763
[man] <i>So, the Catholics were already</i>
<i>involved with various pro-life things.</i>

527
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:17,477
<i>But for Operation Rescue,</i>
<i>the genesis really was more evangelical.</i>

528
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:21,230
We rejoice, Lord. Hallelujah.
Glory to God.

529
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,484
The name comes from Proverbs 24:11.

530
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:29,656
The Biblical verse that says,
"Rescue those unjustly sentenced to die."

531
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,491
Someone else
can be hooked up to this pipe.

532
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:35,244
There'll be no abortions in here today.
No abortions in here today.

533
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,162
Amen.

534
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,872
[Newman] <i>And so our motto was,</i>

535
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:42,835
"We're here to rescue the innocent child
sentenced to die today."

536
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,254
People out into the street.
There's hundreds more...

537
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,091
[Newman] <i>It was a very immediate thing.</i>

538
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:51,302
<i>Almost militaristic. Operation Rescue.</i>

539
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,429
<i>We're here to rescue these babies.</i>

540
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,056
[man] <i>The judges, the politicians,</i>

541
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,183
<i>they're getting the signal,</i>
<i>as is Planned Parenthood.</i>

542
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,104
Legalized child killing's days
are numbered. We will win.

543
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,398
<i>This is a phenomenon.</i>

544
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:09,028
[Newman] <i>It was really an outworking</i>
<i>of our Christian faith.</i>

545
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,912
So, this is the epicenter
of Operation Rescue.

546
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:20,081
This is a former abortion clinic.

547
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,501
We actually took this place
that was an abortion mill.

548
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:28,256
We closed it down, we remodeled it,
and now we've made it our headquarters.

549
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,717
Before we closed the place down,

550
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,928
the property line
is right down on this crack.

551
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,680
And we would stand right here

552
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,266
and minister to the women
that were going in this abortion clinic.

553
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,227
If we stepped over the line,
we'd be arrested.

554
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,563
Just like that, be arrested.

To say that abortion for black women

576
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,393
is somehow a favor to them
to kill their offspring...

also be just incredibly intolerant.

All those people who shot

634
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,976

<i>with the threat to safety</i>
<i>or harm to you or your family,</i>

651
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,925
it becomes a really difficult choice
to make for many people.

652
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,389
<i>And one of the strategies</i>
<i>of the antichoice movement</i>

653
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,099
<i>is to shame people.</i>

654
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,267

They won't let you...

660
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,621
<i>Because controlling</i>

669

Okay. Good afternoon.
I'm Dr. Colleen McNicholas. I'm an OB-GYN.

790

I practice in St. Louis.

791
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,048
There shouldn't be a pro-life
or pro-choice law.

792
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:26,510
There should be a law in healthcare policy

No, Senator.

800
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,449
So, you're not a physician.
Are you a pathologist?

801
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,367
Not at all.

802
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,661
Which is infuriating.

803
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:57,499
Especially from sort of the standpoint
of science and evidence and...

804
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,418
just facts.

805
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:03,380
The abortion clinic in St. Louis
has not been complying with the law

806
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,424
in terms of turning over
complication reports.

807
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:09,511
Every year we have
dozens of pro-life bills introduced.

"Sam, what can I do?"

This is how I feel.

815
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:37,372
Okay? We're not
in the field of medicine here.

816
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:41,084
When did the government start approving
complication plans?

817
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:43,420
I thought the doctors
or the physicians would do that.

818
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:46,131
Our complaint is that
that should be for all clinics.

819
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:49,468
if abortion facilities have to comply
with certain things, then

820
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:53,972
so too should other clinics that are
providing similar levels of care.

821
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,516
Are you putting plans together
for anything else?

822
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,310
I mean, you could eat too much pork!

823
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,854
And have a gallstone
and you'd have to go through surgery.

824
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,606
Why is it that we're just doing this

825
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,651
when it comes to individuals
wanting to have an abortion?

826
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,987
-Well, I mean it is--
-It sounds so ridiculous.

827
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:12,783
[Lee] <i>Abortion is different</i>

828

But talk to your average person
on the street.

831
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:24,169
And they're going to tell you
that abortion is not the same as having

832
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,129
a colonoscopy or having your tooth pulled.

833
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,590
It's something unique and different.

834
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,759
There is no other medical procedure, none,

835
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:34,346
not one, that is legislated
in the way that abortion is.

836
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,390
Enough is enough.

837
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,894
I'm ready to go down fighting,

838

856
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,681

859

862

[man]<i> Falwell saw evangelical Christians</i>

Falwell wanted to organize evangelical
voters, who up until that time

864
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,588

we haven't improved by one iota

perhaps just in time,
for our country's sake.

872
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:00,951
[Balmer] <i>But what got evangelical leaders</i>
<i>interested in politics</i>

873
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:03,286
<i>was this notion that the Bible</i>

874
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:06,498
<i>mandated the separation of the races.</i>

875
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:11,294

<i>for tax-exempt status.</i>

877
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:18,301

<i>in racial segregation, or discrimination,</i>

879

cannot claim tax-exempt status.

880
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:26,810

In our Washington studios
is Jerry Falwell.

917
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:31,810
America has violated the principle

<i>Reagan won 44 states,</i>

[Melich] <i>They set out to change</i>
<i>the dynamic in the Republican party.</i>

932
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:33,663
So they nominated somebody
that would be useful. And they succeeded.

933
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,879
[Lee] It was<i> now eight years</i>
<i>after Roe versus Wade.</i>

934
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,841
<i>And it seemed</i>
<i>like the future of ending abortion</i>

935
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,801
<i>was going to be in the Republican party.</i>

936
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:49,387
And Reagan really gave a lot of hope
to the pro-life community.

937
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,892
[reporter] Can a person be a Christian
and support federal funding of abortion?

938
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:57,354
I believe in an abortion
you are taking a human life.

939
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:01,649
If you believe that, it very definitely
has a religious connotation.

940
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:05,362
He just reaffirmed his support of

941
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:08,073
everything the pro-life
movement represents.

942
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,159
There's never been any question
that he was with us.

943
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:13,328
[protesters] We love life! We want life!

944
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:15,914
[Lee] <i>In the mind of the pro-life</i>
<i>community, the right to abortion</i>

945
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,874
<i>was an aberration in the law.</i>

946
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,293
So, with the election of President Reagan,

947
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:24,589
we thought the next step would be
to try to reverse Roe versus Wade.

948
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:28,051
[chanting] We want life!

[Schlafly] <i>It is the Supreme Court</i>

960
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:12,011
And, of course,
it is the Supreme Court decision

961
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:15,932
that has brought about
this tragic evil of our time.

962
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:19,519
A Supreme Court decision, in 1973,

963
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:24,816
that invented this new right of a woman
to kill her unborn baby.

964
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:29,154
[Lee] <i>If abortion is</i>
<i>a constitutional right,</i>

965
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:32,282
<i>the most important thing was</i>

966
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:35,660
In order to do that, you had to change
the justices on the Court.

967

There's no other way.

968
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:42,125
You need, as quickly as possible,
a reconstituting of the Supreme Court.

She told the Senate today
that she is firmly opposed to abortion.

975

In the area of abortion is
that I am opposed to it

976

as a matter of birth control.

977
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,776
[Lee] <i>So, President Reagan</i>
<i>appointed O'Connor,</i>

<i>then appointed Justice Scalia</i>
<i>and Justice Kennedy.</i>

979
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:16,284
<i>And in the pro-life community there was</i>
<i>the hope that Roe versus Wade</i>

980

981
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:21,331

that some sort of movement is under way
that would ultimately erode Roe v. Wade?

984
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:30,381
I'm not only getting a feeling.
I'm part of it.

985
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:33,593
-[reporter 2] It's happened?
-It's happening.

986
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:37,680
[Greenhouse] <i>The Americans United for Life</i>
<i>is one of the main players in this.</i>

<i>They have a strategy of one anti-abortion</i>
<i>restriction at a time</i>

988

<i>and overturn Roe against Wade.</i>

990
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,320
<i>And it looked</i>
<i>like it actually might happen</i>

991
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:54,822
<i>in an abortion case in 1989.</i>

992
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:59,869
<i>But Justice O'Connor surprised the world</i>
<i>by sustaining Roe against Wade.</i>

993
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,372
And that was a matter of

994
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:05,959
extreme frustration
to the Court's conservatives.

995
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,587
[woman] <i>I think Justice O'Connor</i>
<i>didn't want to be</i>

996
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,589
the first and lone woman on the Court

997
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:14,384
taking away
a settled constitutional right.

998
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,844
And so she upheld Roe versus Wade.

999
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:21,849
<i>But Justice Blackmun made</i>
<i>a very, very important statement,</i> <i>and he read it from the bench and he said,</i>
<i>"Roe versus Wade is hanging by a thread.</i>

1000
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:28,523
We are in a very tenuous circumstance.

00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:31,734
We're only one vote away.
The next case could do it."

1002
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:35,780
And after that,
the political situation really changed.

1003
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:40,451
Like a thousand points of light
in a broad and peaceful sky.

1004
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:43,663
[Melich] <i>When H.W. became president,</i>

1005
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:47,750
we thought that he would be
a pro-choice president.

1006
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:53,298
Abortion divides. We have room
in our party for people that feel

1007
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:56,509
one way, pro-life, or pro-choice.

1008
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,595
This is an issue that divides.

1009
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:01,222
[Melich] <i>When he was a congressman,</i>

1010
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:06,102
<i>he had been known as a big supporter</i>
<i>of family planning, to the point that</i>

1011
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,730
some of his colleagues
called him "Rubbers."

1012

[reporter] Do you favor a constitutional
amendment against abortion?

1013

What's the big challenge here this week?

1016
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,534
I really don't know. I-- Abortion, mostly.

1017
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:25,330
People really need to understand
that the pro-lifers

1018
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:28,750
are now the backbone that is holding up
George Bush.

1019
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:32,503
George Bush has to take
a strong pro-family position.

1020
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:36,007
And frankly, that means
a strong position on abortion.

1021
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,012
[Melich] And Bush turned against choice,

1022
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:46,059
and he took on a position
that was stronger than...

1023
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,020
than anything Reagan ever did.

1024
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:52,065
I believe that abortion is wrong.

1025
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:56,527
I believe that we should work
to overturn Roe vs. Wade.

1026
01:00:57,070 --> 01:01:00,698
<i>And I believe that states should have</i>
<i>the right to prohibit abortions.</i>

1027
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,951
[man]<i> I don't make many guarantees,</i>
<i>but I'll make you one.</i>

1028

Pennsylvania will be
the first state in the Union

1029
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,499

and to outlaw abortion.

01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:13,544
Supreme Court case number 91-744.

1031
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,964
Planned Parenthood

1032
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,050
[Lee] <i>Planned Parenthood versus Casey.</i>

1033
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:22,095
<i>That went up to the Supreme Court</i>
<i>in 1992.</i>

1034
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:25,264
[Peter Jennings] ...one of the most
restrictive abortion laws in the nation.

1035
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,142
And a lot of pro-life people thought
this was going to be the case

1036
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:29,727
that would overturn Roe versus Wade.

1037
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,481
[Jennings] <i>The Bush administration asked</i>
<i>the Supreme Court</i>

1038

<i>to support further limitations</i>

[woman] <i>President Bush</i>
<i>has done all he can do</i>

1040

1041
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:48,413
[Kolbert]<i> I was totally convinced</i>
<i>that we were going to lose.</i>

1042
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:50,373
For he has packed the Court

1043
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:55,461
with justices who are hostile to a woman's
fundamental right to choose abortion.

1044
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:58,214
Abortion litigation is a lot
like <i>Sesame Street.</i>

1045
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,549
You got to learn to count.

1046
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,260
<i>And the only number</i>
<i>that's important is five.</i>

1047
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:04,178
<i>Are there five votes on the Supreme Court?</i>

1048
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,472
Five votes that would overturn Roe.

1049
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:10,101
He is the best person for this position.

1050
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:13,980
<i>The president nominated Clarence Thomas</i>
<i>to the Supreme Court.</i>

1051
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:17,775
<i>And I thought he would be the fifth vote</i>
<i>to overrule Roe.</i>

1052
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:26,492
<i>And I remember there was a silence</i>
<i>in the courtroom that was palpable.</i>

1053
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,162
[Chief Justice] <i>Ms. Kolbert.</i>

1054
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,497
[Kolbert] <i>Mr. Chief Justice,</i>
<i>and may it please the Court.</i>

1055
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:36,252
<i>Whether our Constitution endows</i>
<i>government with the power to force a woman</i>

1056
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:39,255
<i>to continue or to end a pregnancy</i>
<i>against her will</i>

1057
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:41,674
<i>is the central question in this case.</i>

1058
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:46,637
And then the Solicitor General
of the United States stood up and argued

1059
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:49,432
that Roe versus Wade
ought to be overturned.

1060
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:53,394
[Solicitor General] <i>...the State does have</i>
<i>a compelling interest</i>

1061
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:59,233
<i>in the potential life, in fetal life, and</i>
<i>that</i> <i>interest runs throughout pregnancy.</i>

1062
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:02,945
But I wanted the Court
to understand the implications

1063
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:07,575
of changing a standard
that was very protective for women.

1064
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:11,204
[Kolbert] <i>This Court has recognized</i>
<i>that the rights of autonomy,</i>

1065

<i>bodily integrity, and equality are central</i>
<i>to our notions of ordered liberty.</i>

1066
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:19,629
<i>Roe lies at the heart of those interests.</i>

1067
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,256
<i>Because, ultimately,</i>

1068
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,759
abortion is not about whether or not

women should have
particular medical procedures.

1070
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,055
It's about equality.

1071
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:33,184
It's about a view of life,
about who should make important decisions.

1072
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:39,148
<i>It's very rare that you know the date</i>

1074

You know that the case will be decided,
but you don't know when.

1075
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:50,201
<i>But this time we knew when,</i>
<i>because every other case</i>

1076
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:53,204
<i>that they heard that term</i>

1077
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,457
We're waiting outside

<i>You know, it's a 50, 60 page opinion.</i>
<i>It's complicated.</i>

1085
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:26,612
<i>You have to read it and understand it.</i>

1086
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:30,366
At the same time,
I'm shepherded out to talk to

1087
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,536
American media about what just happened.

1088
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,582
I am Kathryn Kolbert.
I am counsel of record on behalf of

1089
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:41,335
Planned Parenthood and the other
abortion clinics in Pennsylvania.

1090
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:43,212
<i>It was a very ambiguous decision.</i>

1091
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:46,716
Three Republican-appointed justices
had gotten together,

1092
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:51,220
<i>and they decided that</i>
<i>rather than overturn Roe against Wade,</i>

1093
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:52,930
<i>they were going to reformulate it...</i>

1094
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,559
<i>with what they called</i>
<i>the undue burden standard.</i>

1095
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,771
<i>So the Court upheld the right to abortion.</i>

1096
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:05,318
<i>But the new standard meant</i>
<i>that states can undertake</i>

1097
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:09,780
to persuade a woman to carry
a pregnancy to term,

1098
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:14,201
but they cannot prevent a woman
from choosing abortion.

1099
01:05:14,952 --> 01:05:16,245
[Kolbert] <i>Under Roe versus Wade,</i>

1100
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:19,457
<i>most abortion restrictions</i>
<i>were unconstitutional.</i>

1101
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:22,960
<i>In Casey, the Court basically said that</i>

1102
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:27,673
<i>states had the latitude to restrict</i>
<i>abortion in more ways than under Roe.</i>

1103
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:31,719
Many, many kinds of restrictions,
waiting periods, informed consent.

1104
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:36,766
Things found unconstitutional under Roe
have been validated by this Court.

1105
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:41,020
And therefore we are much worse off
than we have been in the past.

1106
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:44,565
<i>At the time, I thought, you know,</i>
<i>this is really horrible.</i>

1107
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:46,734
...to place roadblocks
in the path of women...

1108
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:50,947
<i>But whatever problems</i>
<i>the undue burden standard gave us,</i>

1109
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:54,992
it was still preferable
than a total outlaw of abortion.

1110
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:57,370
For a woman in need
of a medical procedure,

1111
01:05:57,828 --> 01:06:00,247
there's a big difference between having
to jump through hoops

1112
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:02,249
<i>and not being able</i>
<i>to get the procedure at all.</i>

1113
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:07,463
Four justices have said
Roe versus Wade must be overturned.

1114
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,257
All it's going to take is one more

1115
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:13,427
and I can only hope
that President Bush gets reelected.

1116
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:22,603
[Clinton] It makes a difference
whether the president believes

1117
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:25,439
in a woman's right to choose. And I do.

1118
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,525
[applause]

1119
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:29,986
[woman] <i>There was some momentum</i>

1120
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:34,281
around the Clintons
and support for abortion rights.

1121
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:38,077
[Clinton] <i>I am proud to nominate</i>
<i>Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to</i>

1122
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,120
<i>the Supreme Court.</i>

1123
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:43,582
It is essential to woman's equality
with man

1124
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,918
<i>that she be the decision-maker.</i>

1125
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:49,171
[Clinton] <i>I'm proud to nominate</i>
<i>Judge Stephen Breyer</i>

1126
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:51,298
<i>to serve on the United States</i>
<i>Supreme Court.</i>

1127
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:53,801
[Nash] <i>And there were bills pending</i>
<i>at the federal level</i>

1128
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:56,512
<i>to protect access to abortion.</i>

1129
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:01,017
The Clinton team has begun
to systematically wage war

1130
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:02,685
against unborn children.

1131
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:06,981
[Nash] <i>And abortion opponents were looking</i>
<i>for a way to stop this momentum.</i>

1132
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,735
So they came up with this new idea and they honed in on later abortion.

1133
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:16,866
Specifically they came up
with the term "partial birth abortion."

1134
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:25,124
Some of you stay on this side,
some of you go on the other side, okay?

1135
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:30,004
Not everyone. Try and spread out and get
the signs as many places as possible. [Newman] <i>Partial birth took off like</i>
<i>wildfire inside the pro-life movement.</i>

1136
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:38,387
<i>It so horrified and shocked the conscience</i>

1137
01:07:38,929 --> 01:07:41,432
<i>and stripped this veil of respectability</i>

1138
01:07:41,515 --> 01:07:43,684
<i>from Planned Parenthood</i>
<i>and the abortionists.</i>

1139
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:46,562
<i>It's terrible. Which side of the fence</i>
<i>are we gonna be on?</i>

1140
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:48,272
We had to educate the public.

1141
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:51,776
Are we gonna continue to support child
killing in America and call it choice?

1142
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:56,030
We made it an issue.
We forced it on America.

1143
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:01,077
This is partial birth abortion.

1144
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:05,498
<i>The abortionist grabs the live baby's legs</i>
<i>with forceps.</i>

1145
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:09,251
[Kolbert] <i>The Republicans introduced</i>
<i>the partial birth abortion law,</i>

1146
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:11,378
<i>even though there's no such thing.</i>

1147
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:14,965
<i>They made up the word</i>
<i>and it was a strategy</i>

1148
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:17,134
<i>that really went to challenging</i>

1149
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:20,054
the question of when late abortion
would be permitted.

1150
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:24,058
With the idea that,
if you could push it earlier and earlier,

1151
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:26,685
you could eliminate a number of abortions

1152
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:30,773
And we knew immediately
that this was going to be a huge issue.

1153
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:34,610
Abortion advocates are claiming that,
by banning partial-birth abortion,

1154
01:08:34,693 --> 01:08:37,446
we are mounting a direct attack
on Roe versus Wade.

1155
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:41,408
For them, there is never an instance
when abortion is inappropriate.

1156
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:44,203
For them,
the right to abortion is absolute

1157
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:48,124
at whatever time, for whatever reason,
and in whatever way,

1158
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:50,376
a woman or an abortionist chooses.

1159
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:54,296
Ninety percent of women who have an
abortion have it in the first trimester.

1160
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,841
<i>That's the vast majority of women.</i>

1161
01:08:57,216 --> 01:09:00,511
<i>And then a smaller proportion have it</i>
<i>before 20 weeks.</i>

1162
01:09:01,178 --> 01:09:04,265
<i>Between 20 and 24 weeks,</i>
<i>we're at probably about one percent.</i>

1163
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:07,518
<i>And then, as we get further along, we're</i>
<i>getting to smaller and smaller numbers,</i>

1164
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:09,103
<i>exceedingly low numbers.</i>

1165
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:12,231
<i>So the majority of abortions</i>
<i>are in the first trimester.</i>

1166
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,900
<i>But we spend most of our time</i>
<i>talking about</i>

1167
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:17,361
<i>abortions that happened</i>
<i>in the second and third trimester.</i>

1168
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:20,739
<i>And this is one of the strategies</i>
<i>of the anti-choice movement.</i>

1169
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:23,033
Why do we call something
the partial-birth abortion,

1170
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:25,161
when really that's not a medical term.

1171
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:27,413
You always go after your enemy
where they're the weakest.

1172
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:31,292
And they know that,
once we win, in the ninth month,

1173
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:33,752
the rest of the card house
comes crumbling down.

1174
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:35,129
We destroy their arguments.

1175
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:37,965
They created a narrative that

1176
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:40,509
women late in pregnancies were

1177
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:44,722
killing their babies 'cause they,
you know, wanted to go to the gym instead.

1178
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:47,933
Totally false. Doesn't happen.

1179
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:52,813
<i>But there's no 30-second sound bite</i>
<i>to counter that image.</i>

1180
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:56,108
<i>They were very good at creating optics,</i>

1181
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:59,236
<i>creating language that supported</i>
<i>their point of view.</i>

1182
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:03,324
<i>And so we had to figure out</i>
<i>how to challenge it politically.</i>

1183
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:06,035
<i>And we were able</i>
<i>to introduce President Clinton</i>

1184
01:10:06,118 --> 01:10:09,955
<i>to women who would be affected</i>
<i>by the law.</i>

1185
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:11,248
<i>Women who were</i>

1186
01:10:11,832 --> 01:10:15,085
losing pregnancies very late
or finding themselves

1187
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:17,963
carrying a pregnancy
with very severe fetal anomalies.

1188
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:21,550
Good morning. I'd like to thank
the subcommittee for inviting me here.

1189
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:26,013
I went in for
a routine seven-month ultrasound.

1190
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:30,184
They were saying,
"This looks good. This looks good."

1191
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:33,354
Then suddenly, they got really quiet.

1192
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:35,189
The doctor said,

1193
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:38,984
"Your daughter has no eyes,
and her heart...

1194
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:42,863
and other major organs are also failing.

1195
01:10:44,156 --> 01:10:46,492
And your child will not live."

1196
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:48,369
[sniffles]

1197
01:10:50,454 --> 01:10:54,625
I remember just looking out the window.
I couldn't look at anybody.

1198
01:10:56,418 --> 01:11:01,674
So my mother-in-law asked, "Do we go on?
Does she have to go on?"

1199
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:07,221
[Clinton] <i>This terrible problem affects</i>
<i>a few hundred Americans</i>

<i>pawns in a larger debate.</i>

1205
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:22,111
<i>And therefore I had no choice</i>
<i>but to veto the bill.</i>

1206
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:25,739
I vetoed it just a few minutes ago
before I met with these families. [Nash] Bill Clinton vetoed it,
but it really spread.

1207
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:34,873
And we started to see
new iterations of these bills,

1208
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:38,627
using slightly different language,
in order to withstand a legal challenge.

1209
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:45,592
It's a shame that child sacrifice
can be allowed in this country.

1210
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:50,764
We are being arrested for speaking
and showing the truth of abortion.

1211

1240
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:29,196
<i>prevents us from prohibiting abortion.</i>

1241
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:30,864
<i>But it does allow us,</i>

1242
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:33,826
<i>the states, to...</i>

1243
01:13:34,326 --> 01:13:36,453
do some things to protect life,

1244
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:41,375
if they can show there is
a compelling state interest.

1245
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:45,421
Governor Rick Perry wanted to end
access to reproductive health care.

1246
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:48,757
And because the legislature is
so disproportionately

1247
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,301
uh, led by the Republican party,

1248
01:13:51,718 --> 01:13:55,931
<i>they proposed abortion restrictions, which</i>
<i>were the most extreme in the country.</i>

1249
01:13:57,349 --> 01:14:02,146
House Bill 2 was a good example of these
kinds of laws that were being passed in

1250
01:14:02,646 --> 01:14:04,648
<i>many states controlled by the Republicans.</i>

1251
01:14:05,065 --> 01:14:08,527
<i>Laws that really focused</i>
<i>on where the abortion could be performed</i>

1252
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:13,073
<i>and regulations to either the doctor's</i>
<i>office or a surgical center.</i>

1253
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:15,534
Thank you for calling
the Southwestern Women's Surgery Center.

1254
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,327
This is Alicia. How may I help you?

1255
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:19,997
This is what are known as TRAP laws: Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers.

1256
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:27,629
And the purpose of these laws is
to make it as difficult as possible

1257
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:29,214
<i>to provide abortion services,</i>

1258
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:31,758
prohibit as many abortions as you can,

1259
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:34,219
make the ones that do occur
as expensive as possible.

1260
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:35,846
<i>It's so obvious what they're doing.</i>

1261
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,434
My goal is to make abortion,

1262
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:43,562
at any stage, a thing of the past.

1263
01:14:43,937 --> 01:14:45,939
[applause]

1264
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:50,152
So these restrictions would shut down
dozens of women's health centers

1265
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:51,487
<i>all across Texas.</i>

1266
01:14:52,112 --> 01:14:54,323
<i>And that's why Senator Wendy Davis</i>

1267
01:14:54,406 --> 01:14:57,034
<i>decided to stand up and fight</i>
<i>for the rights of women.</i>

1268
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:01,955
[Davis] <i>So this bill went to the Senate.</i>

1269
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:07,336
<i>But, because it was the final day</i>
<i>of the session, the clock was ticking.</i>

1270
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:11,507
<i>And that gave me an opportunity</i>
<i>for the filibuster.</i>

1271
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:14,176
Members, I'm rising on the floor today...

1272
01:15:14,384 --> 01:15:19,973
That meant I had about 13 hours of talking
to make sure that this bill did not pass.

1273
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:24,811
<i>The rules in Texas say</i>
<i>that you cannot have a sip of water,</i>

1274
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:26,313
<i>you cannot have anything to drink,</i>

1275
01:15:26,396 --> 01:15:30,108
<i>you cannot lean on your desk</i>
<i>and you certainly cannot leave the floor</i>

1276
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,527
<i>to go to the restroom.</i>

1277
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:37,950
So I had a pair of running shoes
on my feet and I had a catheter bag.

1278
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:41,203
A doctor had come over
at about six o'clock that morning

1279
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:44,998
and inserted a catheter so that
I'd be able to make it through the day.

1280
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,460
Senator Wendy Davis must make it
to midnight.

1281
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,462
That is the end of the special session.

1282
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:53,590
Essentially she's wasting time,
running out the clock.

1283
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:57,219
The way she's doing that? Right now,
she's reading letters from Texas women

1284
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:59,388
<i>who oppose this legislation.</i>

1285
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:02,558
...in order for their voices to be heard.

1286
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:06,270
-...told me any pregnancy will be very...
-[Kolbert] <i>And the filibuster went viral.</i>

1287
01:16:06,853 --> 01:16:08,522
Not only was she a woman

1288
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:12,234
opposing the bill, but she was one
of the only women in the room.

1289
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:15,112
<i>It was an internet moment.</i> [Richards] <i>People had left their kids</i>
<i>with their neighbors</i>

1290
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:25,789
<i>and driven hours to Austin to be there.</i>

1291
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:28,542
<i>Students had left their college campuses</i>

1292
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:31,253
<i>and came to Austin</i>
<i>to hear Wendy filibuster.</i>

1293
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:34,339
These are Texans who relied
on the minority...

1294
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:35,799
[Richards] <i>I'm a Texan.</i>

1295
01:16:35,882 --> 01:16:39,094
<i>Never seen the outpouring of activism</i>
<i>like we saw there.</i>

1296
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:41,722
You literally could not get
in the capitol.

1297
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:44,558
Every annex was full, every room was full.

1298
01:16:45,475 --> 01:16:46,518
<i>It was extraordinary.</i>

1299
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:49,646
...another ruling she made
was if there was a...

1300
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:52,649
[Davis] <i>And about 15 minutes</i>
<i>before midnight,</i>

1301
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:55,694
<i>procedural rules of order were broken...</i>

1302
01:16:56,403 --> 01:16:57,487
[man] <i>...and the third...</i>

1303
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:00,282
[Davis] <i>...in order to bring</i>
<i>my filibuster to an end.</i>

1304
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:03,744
<i>And the people who were there</i>
<i>understood</i>

1305
01:17:03,827 --> 01:17:08,332
<i>that rules were being broken</i>
<i>in order to silence opposition to a bill.</i>

1306
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:11,293
[man] After consultation
with the parliamentarian and after...

1307
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:14,588
-[Davis] <i>And they'd had enough.</i>
-...well taken and is sustained.

1308
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:15,881
[woman] Bullshit!

1309
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:18,175
The chair recognizes Senator...

1310
01:17:18,258 --> 01:17:19,468
[crowd yelling]

1311
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:22,429
[chanting] Let her speak!
Let her speak! Let her speak!

1312
01:17:22,512 --> 01:17:25,057
Let her speak! Let her speak!
Let her speak!

1313
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,897
Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!

1314
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,858
Wendy! Wendy!
Wendy! Wendy!

1315
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:37,444
Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!

1316
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:41,239
[Davis] <i>And as they began to scream,</i>

1317
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:45,202
<i>everyone up and down the hallways</i>
<i>began to scream,</i>

1318
01:17:45,285 --> 01:17:49,164
<i>and at every level of the rotunda</i>
<i>and outside on the capitol lawn.</i>

1319
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:52,918
<i>And I could literally feel</i>

1320
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:56,296
<i>the vibration of their voices</i>
<i>and their energy</i>

1321
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,923
<i>and the pounding of their feet.</i>

1322
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:01,551
[man] If I can have order.
We are in the middle of a vote.

1323
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:04,429
The secretary has started the vote.

1324
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:07,057
[Davis] <i>It ate up enough of the clock</i>

1325
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:10,936
<i>that the final vote wasn't taken</i>
<i>until 12:03.</i>

1326
01:18:11,269 --> 01:18:14,856
Members, it's now past midnight. And so...

1327
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:18,193
And it became known
as the people's filibuster. Rightly so.

1328
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:21,530
[Richards] This is straight from
Senator Wendy Davis, okay?

1329
01:18:21,905 --> 01:18:22,739
Hold your applause.

1330
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:26,201
First, "I love you guys." Okay? -[crowd whooping]
-We love you, too, Wendy!

1331
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:32,624
[crowd cheers]

1332
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:39,464
"So the lieutenant governor has agreed
that SB-5 is dead."

1333
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,550
[cheering]

1334
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:58,191
[Perry] <i>The woman who filibustered</i>
<i>the Senate the other day,</i>

1335
01:18:59,943 --> 01:19:02,571
<i>she was born into difficult circumstances.</i>

1336
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,740
<i>She's the daughter of a single woman.</i>

1337
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:07,367
<i>She was a teenage mother herself.</i>

1338
01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:12,247
<i>She managed to eventually graduate</i>
<i>from Harvard Law School</i>

1339

<i>and serve in the Texas Senate.</i>

1340
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:16,918
<i>It's unfortunate</i>

1341
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:20,005
that she hasn't learned
from her own example

1342
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:24,593
that every life must be given a chance
to realize its full potential

1343
01:19:24,676 --> 01:19:26,511
and that every life matters.

[Davis] <i>We had successfully</i>
<i>killed the bill.</i>

01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,768
But we were called right back
within a few days.

1347
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:37,230
And, of course, this time
there was no way to filibuster.

[man] We talked about the choice.

1353
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:59,336
Do you think if the mother had
a conversation with the baby and said,

1354
01:19:59,544 --> 01:20:03,006
"You know, this just isn't really
convenient to give birth to you right now.

-I think--
-That was very offensive!

1358
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,932
[man] I think that baby would say--

1359
01:20:12,682 --> 01:20:14,518
This is an assault on women!

1360
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,522
I don't get mad with those folks.

You are failing Texas!

[Davis] In just a few moments,

1364
01:20:33,578 --> 01:20:35,455
we are going to vote on a bill

1365
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:39,751
that has deeply and profoundly divided us.

1366
01:20:40,794 --> 01:20:42,796
<i>Separating us by political party...</i>

1367
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:45,674
<i>by gender...</i>

<i>by life experience...</i>

[chanting] Not in this life!

<i>We all believe in the beauty</i>
<i>and the wonder that is human life.</i>

1372

<i>But I also believe that women already here</i>

1373

<i>And that they deserve to live,</i>

<i>they deserve to determine</i>
<i>the direction of their lives,</i>

1376

<i>they deserve to be recognized</i>
<i>as full people...</i>

<i>fully capable</i>
<i>of making difficult decisions</i>

Wendy! Wendy!
Wendy! Wendy!

1381
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:39,227
No woman should be judged by someone else,

1382
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:43,607
someone who believes
they would have made a different decision.

1383
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:47,777
No woman should be judged by someone else,

1384
01:21:48,528 --> 01:21:52,699
because these decisions
are never ever easy.

1385
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:56,411
They're not made casually or quickly.

1386
01:21:56,745 --> 01:22:01,750
And those of us in the Senate
should refuse to make this decision

1387
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:04,377
casually or quickly.

1388
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:07,547
Because the fight for the future of Texas

1389
01:22:08,214 --> 01:22:09,382
is just beginning.

1390
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:12,135

We won't go back!

1394
01:22:26,566 --> 01:22:27,400
Come on!

1395
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,152
We won't go back! We won't go back!

1396
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:37,369
It is our responsibility to improve
the quality of care for women

1397
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:38,328
in the state.

1398

[Davis] <i>Of course, the argument was made</i>

And in spite of incredible scientific
pushback to that statement,

1401
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:52,300
House Bill 2 passed.

1402

01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:28,169
<i>But there was something really important</i>
<i>that had happened.</i>

1411
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:34,467
We as a state woke up to the reality
of an assault on women.

1412
01:23:35,218 --> 01:23:38,054
We woke up to the reality of our power.

1413
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:42,267

to grow.

<i>That's absolutely correct.</i>

all of these specious arguments,

<i>This is one of the lowest-risk procedures.</i>

<i>We could go on and on.</i>

1449

And I have to tell you,
they took over that argument.

1450
01:25:48,017 --> 01:25:52,564
[Justice Ginsburg] <i>What it's about is that</i>
<i>a woman has a fundamental right</i>

<i>to make this choice for herself.</i>

1452
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:59,445
Today the Supreme Court struck down
a Texas law

1453
01:25:59,612 --> 01:26:02,490
that imposed strict requirements
on clinics and doctors,

1454
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:07,078
finding those limits place an undue burden
on the constitutional right to abortion.

1455
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:14,752
[Dr. McNicholas]
<i>For me, the highlight of that decision was</i>

1456
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:18,381
<i>the justices' incorporation</i>
<i>of actual medicine and science.</i>

1457
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:24,888
<i>We've seen a decision about abortion</i> that says,
"If you're going to make a claim,

1458
01:26:27,765 --> 01:26:30,018
the claim must be factually accurate."

1459
01:26:30,101 --> 01:26:31,603
<i>But the reality is</i>

1460
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:35,440
<i>that the appointing of our justices</i>
<i>is highly political.</i>

1461
01:26:39,402 --> 01:26:43,656
<i>And so, at any time, the balance</i>
<i>of the Court can change.</i>

1462
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:46,910
And the decision may be different
next time.

[Tobias]
<i>The Supreme Court decision in Hellerstedt</i>

reinforced, once again,

1465
01:27:01,132 --> 01:27:04,677
that if we want to change the laws,
we have to change the Supreme Court.

from a Christian world view.
We are unapologetically Christian.

Human life is precious, born or unborn.

Ronald Reagan signed the most liberal
abortion law in America in the late '60s,

1498

I think when you interrupt the pregnancy,
you're taking a human life.

1500
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:03,796
So all Donald Trump has to do is,
as those prior nominees did,

1501
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:05,423
make it clear.

will be pro-life.

1506

essential for a Republican victory.

It's not only about Roe v Wade.

It is about what's happening right now
in America.

1511
01:29:38,247 --> 01:29:40,875
So many states are putting

1512

very stringent regulations on women that

1513

1551
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:40,221
<i>And we have to remain vigilant.</i>

1552
01:32:40,429 --> 01:32:44,475
<i>Because there is a very real concern</i>
<i>that the Trump administration is going</i>

1553
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,185
<i>to appoint anti-abortion judges.</i>

1554
01:32:46,519 --> 01:32:49,438
[reporter] <i>President Trump announced</i>
<i>nearly a dozen new nominees</i>

1555
01:32:49,522 --> 01:32:51,232
<i>for the lower federal courts.</i>

1556
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:54,569
[Seago] <i>Hundreds of seats are going</i>
<i>to be filled by this administration</i>

1557
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:56,028
<i>thoughout the judicial system.</i>

1558
01:32:56,112 --> 01:32:59,365
<i>These people will be serving</i>
<i>for the rest of their lives.</i>

1559
01:32:59,448 --> 01:33:02,326
It's life term. It's generations
of impact on American law.

1560
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,912
[Trump] <i>The Court of Appeals,</i>
<i>circuit judges...</i>

1561
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:06,664
whether it be district judges...

1562
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:09,625
[Seago] <i>When you really think about</i>
<i>the way we're going,</i>

1563
01:33:09,792 --> 01:33:12,670
<i>years from now, picking good judges</i>
<i>even at the district level</i>

1564
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:16,591
is extremely important.
And that's how we're going to finish this

1565
01:33:16,757 --> 01:33:18,175
to overtun Roe vs. Wade.

1566
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:21,012
[Trump] <i>Today I am keeping</i>
<i>another promise,</i>

1567
01:33:21,929 --> 01:33:25,266
by nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch

1568
01:33:25,349 --> 01:33:28,019
<i>to the United States Supreme Court.</i>

1569
01:33:28,102 --> 01:33:31,147
[Seago] <i>We're putting out strong</i>
<i>pro-life bills and so, eventually,</i>

1570
01:33:31,230 --> 01:33:33,858
<i>the Supreme Court will weigh in</i>
<i>on the issue.</i>

1571
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:37,361
[Tobias] <i>I don't know</i>
<i>how long it will take</i>

1572
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:40,281
to overturn Roe v. Wade,
or when it will be overturned.

1573
01:33:40,823 --> 01:33:42,617
I have no doubt it will be.

1574
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:46,954
[Pence] All across the nation,

1575
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:50,833
life is winning again in America.

1576
01:33:50,916 --> 01:33:52,668
[crowd cheering]

1577
01:33:55,087 --> 01:33:57,381
[reporter] <i>In a monumental moment</i>
<i>for the Supreme Court,</i>

1578
01:33:57,465 --> 01:34:00,134
<i>Justice Anthony Kennedy is retiring</i>
<i>from the Court.</i>

1579
01:34:00,217 --> 01:34:02,595
<i>The crucial swing vote</i>
<i>is now stepping down</i>

1580
01:34:02,678 --> 01:34:06,182
<i>and President Trump will get the chance</i>
<i>to shape this Court for a generation.</i>

1581
01:34:06,682 --> 01:34:10,102
[man] <i>This is an opportunity to restore</i>
<i>a culture of life in this country.</i>

1582
01:34:10,186 --> 01:34:12,355
This is a historic moment.

1583
01:34:12,688 --> 01:34:14,774
And we have a chance
to take down Roe v. Wade.

1584
01:34:15,358 --> 01:34:17,860
[Perkins] <i>I think this supercharges</i>
<i>the president's base.</i>

1585
01:34:17,943 --> 01:34:20,321
<i>Seven out of ten of his evangelical voters</i>

1586
01:34:20,404 --> 01:34:23,032
<i>said that the Supreme Court has</i>
<i>an effect on their daily lives.</i>

1587
01:34:23,115 --> 01:34:26,702
And I think he should put forth
a candidate that is above reproach

1588
01:34:26,786 --> 01:34:28,996
on this issue of the sanctity
of human life.

1589
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:30,956
And I think Roe can be overturned.

1590
01:34:31,874 --> 01:34:35,044
I do believe it could be overturned
and I think it goes back to the states.

1591
01:34:35,127 --> 01:34:38,964
And I think that the states will decide
what policies to handle. And I think...

1592
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:42,301
we will be
a predominantly pro-life nation.

1593
01:34:43,094 --> 01:34:45,638
You're gonna see 20 states

1594
01:34:46,555 --> 01:34:49,225
pass laws banning abortion outright.

1595
01:34:49,308 --> 01:34:50,601
<i>Because they know</i>

1596
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:53,604
<i>that there are now going to be</i>
<i>five votes on the Supreme Court</i>

1597
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:55,272
<i>to overturn Roe v. Wade.</i>

1598
01:34:55,731 --> 01:34:58,359
[Tobias] <i>If Roe v. Wade is overturned</i>
<i>by the Supreme Court,</i>

1599
01:34:58,442 --> 01:35:01,112
we will see some states that will say
abortion is not allowed,

1600
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:03,948
there will be some states
that are going to...

1601
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:07,493
probably not place many limits
on abortion at all,

1602
01:35:08,202 --> 01:35:11,330
but we are not going to stop.
We will keep working

1603
01:35:11,789 --> 01:35:13,541
<i>to protect the unborn babies.</i>

1604
01:35:22,091 --> 01:35:25,803
[Dr. McNicholas] <i>Whether or not Roe</i>
<i>is overturned, the rights granted by Roe</i>

1605
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:28,389
<i>are almost gone for many women already.</i>

1606
01:35:30,057 --> 01:35:32,560
<i>So, if doctors can't perform</i>
<i>the procedure,</i>

1607
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:35,771
<i>or clinics can't keep their doors open...</i>
