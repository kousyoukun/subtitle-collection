1
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:18,309
Everything involved in an abortion
is sin. and it's wrong.

2
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,686
I actually believe it's evil.

3
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,522
And so there's no value
in things that are evil.

4
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,489
The child is ripped limb from limb
while it's still alive,

5
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,742
while his heart is still beating.

6
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:38,997
I'm a mother.

7
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,293
I loved my pregnancies.
I love my children.

8
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,462
I'm now a grandmother of four.

9
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,842
When a woman becomes pregnant...

10
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,681
she loses a part of herself
to someone else.

11
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,102
Most of us want that
because it's beautiful.

12
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,439
It is not that way for everyone.

13
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:07,525
We can sit here self-righteously
and decide

14
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:11,488
that we always know best
for every person, but we do not.

15
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:16,493
There's no reason to come back here,
session after session,

16
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,204
and make it more and more difficult

17
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:22,457
and drive women back into the shadows
of illegal abortions,

18
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,044
because it's exactly what this will do.
They will not stop having them.

19
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:31,466
They've always had abortions. We've always
had abortions. Women always had abortions.

20
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,844
And that will always be something
that will be sought.

21
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,431
If you want to stop abortions,

22
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:41,893
then help me stop unwanted pregnancies.

23
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,232
Question occurs on the adoption of the amendment.
 - -Representative Klick voting aye.

24
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,320
Representative Oliverson voting aye.

25
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,615
Have all members voted?

26
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,785
There being 92 ayes and 42 nays,
the amendment is adopted.

27
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,124
A bill has moved forward
in the legislature,

28
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,459
placing more restrictions on abortion…

29
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,711
They're trying to get something in place…

30
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,880
Texas will have new abortion regulations.

31
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,717
...so that there's less
and less opportunity to have an abortion,

32
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,888
till, perhaps, there is no option at all.

33
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:23,184
I was a young woman prior to Roe v. Wade,
when abortion was illegal.

34
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,980
I know the difficulties
of that period of time.

35
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:32,110
The idea that we would go back to that
was just unbearable to me.

36
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:36,906
The bill banned one of the most common
types of second-trimester abortions.

37
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:40,952
This bill prohibits
one specific procedure.

38
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,997
But we made it very clear
from the beginning

39
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,710
that the legislative priority needs to be
something that will stop abortions.

40
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,879
The legislative priority
needs to be something

41
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:54,716
that reveals the truth about abortion,
and the legislative priority

42
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,969
needs to be something that will get us
closer to overturning Roe v. Wade.

43
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:05,310
My goal is to make abortion at any stage
a thing of the past.

44
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,815
This bill
actually protects human life

45
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,152
beyond 20 weeks here
in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

46
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,656
I am pro-life,
and I very strongly believe

47
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,034
that we must promote life, defend life…

48
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:24,204
My goal is to end abortion
in Mississippi.

49
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:35,381
There is a steady chipping away
of the right to abortion in America.

50
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:39,260
There are places in the country,
it's as if Roe versus Wade never happened.

51
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,722
The Supreme Court today
legalized abortions.

52
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:48,895
Since 2010, 300 abortion restrictions
have been passed in this country,

53
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:54,359
and I think many people are unaware
of how restricted abortion has become.

54
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,819
The Republican Party's
the party of life,

55
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,988
'cause people want life,
they don't want death.

56
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,699
We want to end abortion.

57
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,619
If we're gonna do it through
continuous legislation,

58
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,914
then we're gonna go back again and again
and again, until we win.

59
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,187
I think the feeling was that

60
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,357
with the climate as pretty tense
around the abortion issue in Missouri…

61
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,150
Missouri used to have
several places

62
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,152
where you could get an abortion,

63
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,446
but over the last decade,

64
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,408
more and more laws and regulations
have been passed…

65
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,868
Planned Parenthood
confirmed the Columbia clinic

66
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,495
has stopped performing abortions.

67
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,871
...and because of that,

68
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,999
it becomes harder
and harder to provide that care.

69
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,127
Thursday was the last day women
could have an abortion at the clinic.

70
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,130
And now there's just
one abortion clinic in Missouri.

71
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,510
She's the lady that does the abortions.

72
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,804
The Planned Parenthood
in Saint Louis.

73
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,224
God does love you.

74
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,603
Please, think about what
you're doing today and not do that.

75
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,190
These babies
don't want to die today, Colleen.

76
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,359
When I started out,

77
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:22,113
I thought abortion would just be
part of my practice; that, you know,

78
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,782
just like people need hysterectomies,
people need abortions,

79
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,076
and I will take care of my patients
who need those.

80
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:33,041
But I realize that in conservative states
it can be very hard to get an abortion.

81
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,962
And so I became a physician
who really focuses on abortion care.

82
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,799
I live in Saint Louis, but... three out of four weeks,
I'm traveling somewhere.

83
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,140
And it might be Monday and Tuesday
in Oklahoma,

84
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,809
Friday and Saturday back to St. Louis.

85
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,437
Then the following Monday in Wichita,

86
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,775
which is one of the four places
where I provide abortions.

87
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,488
They kill people for a living here.

88
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:07,075
We cannot stand by and say, "Well,
we're just gonna let that happen,"

89
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,077
or it's the woman's choice and so on.

90
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,955
I'm happy with what we're doing,
and I'm gonna continue doing it.

91
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,666
And we're gonna win.
I'm a big-time Trump supporter,

92
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,418
and we're gonna win this.

93
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:21,172
It's-- The time is coming. The truth
is coming out, that's what's happening.

94
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,760
Well, I've had
these people out here ask me

95
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:30,223
what my thoughts and opinions
of abortion itself is.

96
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:35,144
And I give 'em the same answer.
"My opinion." I keep it that way.

97
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:39,857
The main reason I'm here is that girl
that flies up there on that flagpole.

98
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,653
What I have against these people
more than anything

99
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,948
is that they keep trying to push
their religion up on someone else

100
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,201
in a nation that's supposed to have
religious freedom.

101
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,622
You know, you can think
whatever you want about it.

102
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,625
But, in America,

103
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,461
one in four women will have an abortion
in their life.

104
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,590
So, to me,
abortion is just basic health care.

105
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,469
We're gonna remove the pregnancy, okay?

106
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,473
And when I think about
how politicized this has become…

107
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:18,479
I wonder, you know,
well, how did this happen?

108
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,238
In all the soul-searching
I have done,

109
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,074
I sincerely feel that if they do it now…

110
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,244
that they are only disengaging from me…

111
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,705
a kind of mass of tissue.

112
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,001
In the early 1960s,
abortion was illegal.

113
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,629
And there was a woman
named Sherri Finkbine.

114
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:48,509
She was a children's television hostess
in Phoenix.

115
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:49,677
Miss Sherri.

116
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,847
Uh, she had four children,

117
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,184
and she was pregnant
with a much-wanted baby.

118
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,437
But she had taken this drug
called thalidomide.

119
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,650
And she went to her doctor and said,
"What about this?"

120
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,779
And he said, "I recommend
that you have an abortion."

121
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,910
He said, "I can arrange an abortion
for you in the hospital here."

122
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,165
Hospitals did some what they called
"therapeutic abortions,"

123
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,626
only to save the life of women.

124
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,088
But if the doctor wanted to help the woman
out, he would interpret that very broadly.

125
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,883
The woman might say,
"I'm gonna kill myself."

126
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,928
Then he could say, "Her life is at stake."

127
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,098
If therapeutic abortion is done,
it's usually done on the basis

128
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:40,228
of the mental and emotional disturbance
to the patient.

129
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,481
Women had to go before
a committee of male doctors

130
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,649
to ask for an abortion.

131
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,236
And women were often treated
very badly. Like,

132
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:52,073
"Well, we'll do the abortion for you,
but if you agree to be sterilized."

133
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,991
It was a common procedure.

134
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,370
"We don't want to clean up your mess."
They would say things like that.

135
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,831
But if you were a wealthy white woman,

136
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,211
you could probably find a way
to get access to the procedure,

137
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,463
and it would be called
a therapeutic abortion.

138
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,052
Sherri had an appointment
at the hospital for the abortion.

139
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,807
And she felt that she had an obligation
to let this be known

140
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,018
so that other women in the same position
would have the same option.

141
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,479
But once the...

142
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,066
the word kind of got out
into the local newspaper,

143
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,027
you know, the hospital said,
"Oh, no, we can't give you an abortion."

144
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,990
She couldn't find a place for an abortion
any place in the country.

145
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,324
She had to go to Sweden.

146
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:40,037
I just want to do
what's right for myself and my family,

147
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,040
and I don't feel bitter towards people
who oppose this religiously.

148
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,460
I think we're doing the right thing.
I'd like to really emphasize.

149
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,671
We're not making a decision
for other people.

150
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,592
This is right for our family
and in our particular case.

151
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,012
This became a big story.
It was in Life magazine.

152
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,433
I remember as a very young kid reading it
and thinking, "Hmm, what's this about?"

153
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,102
So, it focused people's attention.

154
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:14,530
If you were pregnant and did not
want to be, in the '50s and '60s,

155
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,241
you had very few options.

156
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,120
So, if you didn't want to have a child,

157
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,249
either you were lucky enough to have
a family doctor who would help you,

158
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,879
or to have enough money to go
to Puerto Rico or some other country,

159
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,757
where you could get an abortion.

160
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,637
After I graduated from college,
I was pregnant

161
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,849
and I was in England.
I didn't know what to do and...

162
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:47,313
was terrified. And I found a doctor
in the phone book in London.

163
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,608
And he said, "Promise me two things.

164
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,861
One, you will not tell anyone my name.

165
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,531
And two, you will do what you want
to do with your life."

166
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,911
And I'm grateful to him to this day.

167
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,584
I didn't know anything about abortion

168
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,796
until I became the chaplain
at Skidmore College in 1966.

169
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,258
And I told my wife at one point,
I said, "You know, 1,400 young women.

170
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,094
What kind of problems could they have?"

171
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,721
And she said, "You're a dope.
You're gonna find out."

172
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,015
Students who were pregnant,

173
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,267
but didn't want to tell their families,
would come to me.

174
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,271
And I'd send the student
to a doctor in Schenectady,

175
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,774
who always found it necessary
to do an abortion.

176
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,152
And that's how I learned
that I wasn't just a chaplain.

177
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,238
I learned I was an abortion counselor.

178
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:42,618
There were many other college chaplains
doing the same thing around the country.

179
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,623
 This is the Clergy Consultation
Service on problem pregnancy.

180
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,750
The first public
organized group

181
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,502
was the Clergy Consultation Service.

182
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,256
This was 19 Protestant ministers
and two Jewish rabbis.

183
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,217
Clergymen counseling this week
are Reverend...

184
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,010
And I was a part of that.

185
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:04,265
We would not ask them why they were having
the abortion. That was not our business.

186
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:08,102
But most of the women wanted to talk
about it. They wanted to tell me why.

187
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,814
And so it was quite an education
for a young male minister

188
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,274
into the lives of women.

189
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:19,697
We went into this apartment,
and it was dark, dingy.

190
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:25,411
He apologized. He said, "I'm sorry
you have to be treated like a criminal."

191
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,916
This 24-year-old girl had
an illegal abortion less than an hour ago.

192
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:37,089
The laws which govern abortion are broken
an estimated one million times a year.

193
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,718
Even though
they suffered great indignity,

194
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:45,931
wealthy women often had a safe way
of ending an unintended pregnancy.

195
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,685
But during my clinical training
at Harlem Hospital,

196
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,022
I really was thrust
into an environment

197
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:57,193
where women were from a very poor
and deprived background.

198
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,280
And then I saw that African-American women

199
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:05,868
who were disproportionately poor
were the most directly hurt

200
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,246
by the restrictive policies of the time.

201
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:13,292
There were some pretty sad cases
of women attempting

202
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,961
to terminate their pregnancies themselves.

203
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,009
The facts are astonishing.

204
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:26,222
350,000 women a year suffer complications.

205
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,891
5,000 of these women die.

206
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:33,562
There were many terrified women
who were using coat hangers

207
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:37,483
and knives and throwing themselves
down stairs.

208
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:43,197
And going to an illegal abortion doctor
was often unsafe.

209
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,492
It was just a piece of hanger,
an ordinary hanger.

210
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,495
Not a whole one. Just a piece.

211
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,249
When you have an abortion,
you have to pay $700

212
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,292
to go through
this cloak-and-dagger business

213
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,504
to find you some guy who's willing
to stick a hanger up you.

214
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,883
I heard that there was
a meeting.

215
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,010
It was being held in a church
in the Village.

216
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,347
 What I'm talking about,

217
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,101
more than likely, look at your neighbor.
She had an abortion.

218
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,272
And, you know,
women just got up and told their stories.

219
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,315
Those men offered me a deal:

220
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,943
I couldn't have an abortion
if I wasn't sterilized...

221
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:25,489
And I had never, ever in my life
heard women telling the truth

222
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,325
about something
that only happened to women,

223
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:32,162
and saying, "This doesn't have to be
this way. We have to change it."

224
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:38,127
'Cause the laws are made
to keep that woman in her place.

225
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,296
And suddenly, you know, that was

226
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:45,009
a great "aha." You know, I thought,
"Okay, I had this experience.

227
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:48,304
One in three American women
has had this experience.

228
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,433
Why, why is it illegal and dangerous?"

229
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:58,188
That was kind of the beginning
of the unraveling.

230
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,566
You got something to hide?

231
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:04,528
I'm not sorry I did it and I would do it
again, and I think it should be legalized.

232
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,906
The issue is
reproductive freedom,

233
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:11,994
and that means the right to have children,
as well as the right not to have children.

234
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,204
Something really profound is happening.

235
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,457
Mainly that women
have caught onto the game.

236
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,917
We don't know it completely yet.

237
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,961
You know, we haven't really discovered
the total anatomy of our oppression

238
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:24,298
and of what they've been doing to us.
But we do know that it's happening.

239
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,466
We're on to it.

240
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,884
Free choice!

241
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,553
This is going to be a battle,
and we will not give up

242
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:33,807
on the right of a woman
to achieve abortion.

243
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:38,729
Early feminists... understood immediately

244
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:42,191
that abortion was a central issue

245
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,818
of feminism and to women's rights.

246
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,363
-What do we want?
-Free choice!

247
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,948
-When do you want it?
-Now!

248
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,325
If you didn't have control
over your own body,

249
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,118
what kind of right could you ask for?

250
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:57,790
It is a political issue,
and the state means to control our bodies.

251
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,167
We produce the soldiers,
we produce the workers,

252
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,504
and they fear the loss of that control.

253
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,090
It's the basis of democracy

254
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,550
that you control your own body.

255
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:14,056
And it's the basis of hierarchy
and totalitarian regimes that you don't.

256
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,892
Safe legal abortions
are not available to our--

257
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,144
All right. Will you please sit down
or be removed--

258
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,980
No, we aren't gonna sit down.
Why don't you--

259
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,732
A woman gets pregnant
and she's treated like a criminal.

260
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,150
She can't get an abortion.

261
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,988
She has to go through having that child,
whether she wants it or not.

262
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,742
Before the courts
got involved in the abortion issue,

263
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:38,122
it looked as if the matter
would be settled in politics.

264
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:43,919
California passed a new liberalized
abortion law today.

265
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:50,426
California Governor Ronald Reagan
actually signed a reform bill.

266
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,806
I think one thing that people
don't realize today

267
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:59,727
is that it was the Republican Party
that was the pro-choice party.

268
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:08,527
And there were states with Republican
governors who passed abortion reforms.

269
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:13,782
And then New York totally repealed
the old 19th-century abortion law.

270
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,910
…one of the nation's
most sweeping abortion control bills.

271
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,831
 The New York law said
you can have an abortion

272
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,501
throughout the first two trimesters
just if you wanted.

273
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,421
You don't have to give a reason
or anything. It's your choice.

274
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,384
And on July 1st, 1970,

275
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,887
the first legal abortion clinic
in America

276
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,889
was opened by the clergy of New York City.

277
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,936
And that clinic did over
a hundred abortions a day

278
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,897
for 13 months,

279
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,608
until other clinics had formed.

280
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,360
This is the first radical step.

281
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,322
And that set off the Catholic Church.

282
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,366
I have set before you

283
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,827
life and death.

284
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,790
Therefore, choose life.

285
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,836
The unborn
child has no choice.

286
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:12,091
Does the Catholic Church give you
as much help as you need in this issue?

287
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,844
The Catholic Church
was very strategic

288
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,679
in its opposition to abortion.

289
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,515
They set up the Right to Life committee,

290
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:23,143
and the cardinal and the church
pushed back vigorously.

291
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,729
Legal abortion in New York

292
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:30,484
has already claimed
almost a half million innocent lives.

293
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,904
And the New York abortion law
came up in the legislature.

294
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:37,282
…to abort a human fetus in the womb,
you oughta get sick to your stomach!

295
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,786
There were a lot of
Catholic voters in New York,

296
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,706
and the church was saying,
"We're against abortion."

297
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:51,171
Ours is a nation
with a Judeo-Christian heritage.

298
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,966
Republicans were in control
of the legislature.

299
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,136
None of this justifies abortion.

300
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:00,305
And now they were repealing
legalized abortion.

301
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:06,979
The Republicans I knew got angry about
taxes and how big the budget's gonna be.

302
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:11,733
I think that the traditions
of the Republican Party are the traditions

303
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,528
of an individual person to choose
what he wishes,

304
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,030
as long as it doesn't infringe
upon other people.

305
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,868
We were the party
that believed in individual liberty.

306
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,119
Congratulations.

307
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,788
Governor Rockefeller
was pro-choice.

308
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:25,956
One more committee...

309
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,875
And we felt, "Why should the state

310
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,752
be telling women whether or not
they could have an abortion?"

311
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,755
Rockefeller vetoed the bill…

312
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,137
and abortion stayed legal in New York.

313
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,393
There was a Gallup poll
in the summer of 1972

314
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,563
that asked people to answer the question,

315
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:53,984
"Do you believe that abortion should be
a matter between a woman and her doctor?"

316
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:58,572
Republicans by about two-thirds
said yes to that question,

317
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:02,284
"Abortion should be a matter left
to a woman and her doctor."

318
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,536
Not the government.

319
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,303
I think I'm probably
the oldest provider

320
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,180
of abortion services in the country.

321
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,810
I did my first abortion in 1967.

322
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,395
Illegal abortion.

323
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:37,110
The Clergy Consultation called,
and they asked me,

324
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:41,406
"Curtis, would you
consider doing abortions?"

325
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,243
Do you have any problems
you want to discuss with me?

326
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,953
So, that's where it started.

327
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,124
And I thought I could go to prison,
I could lose my medical license.

328
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,837
And I grew up religious.
I became an ordained minister

329
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,589
my senior year in high school.

330
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,636
And I think the basic Christian teaching
is compassion and service.

331
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,307
My head and my heart and my hands
said to do this. I can make a difference,

332
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,851
and I'm going take the risk.

333
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,982
I've done this work ever since.

334
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:20,195
I'm now 80 years old.
And after 80 years, I've decided

335
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:24,074
I'm not moving on to another career.
I think this is it.

336
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,450
I mean, I'm still needed.

337
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,455
Thank you for calling
the Southwestern Women's Surgery Center.

338
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,832
I'm Alicia. How may I help you?

339
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,586
Okay. I have availability
for tomorrow afternoon...

340
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,426
I've been urged by people
to pass on

341
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,803
what I have learned and experienced.

342
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:48,890
So, that's what I'm doing, trying to teach
as many young doctors as I can.

343
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,976
…dilate carefully…

344
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,396
My philosophy is that the goal
in providing abortions

345
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:58,900
is to assist the woman in making
the best decision she can

346
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,569
for her and her life...

347
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,821
in whatever that takes.

348
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:09,870
The most important moral question of
the abortion debate

349
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,289
is what is in the womb?

350
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:16,835
Is it a person? Does it deserve our
moral attention and protection or not?

351
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,337
That is the most important question.

352
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,590
In the pro-life movement,
we're outraged, because we believe

353
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,800
that elective abortion is

354
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,761
the taking of an innocent human life.

355
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,514
That is an act of injustice that
we can stop and we need to stop.

356
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,100
-This is Doctor Boyd.
-Dr. Boyd.

357
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,936
If you have questions,
we want you to let us know.

358
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,981
And we'll take good care of you
and make this...

359
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,442
Women continue a pregnancy
and have a baby,

360
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,986
because they want a baby at that time.

361
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,990
And they have an abortion
because they don't want to be pregnant

362
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,659
at that time in their life
for their own sufficient reasons.

363
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,620
The state of Texas requires

364
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:55,957
that you be seen at least 24 hours
before your abortion.

365
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,127
And then I'm gonna show you
this sonogram.

366
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,838
That looks like
between five and six weeks, okay?

367
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:06,468
Sonogram technology is one of the best
friends of the pro-life movement.

368
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:11,264
It is changing a generation's mind about
what's going on in the womb of a woman.

369
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:15,394
It is very common for expecting mothers
to have sonograms

370
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:19,773
on their fridge for children to know what
that picture is. That is their sibling.

371
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:23,652
And so this was a great tool that we
wanted to tap into and to use,

372
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:27,489
and we saw that abortion clinics
were already using sonogram technology

373
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,824
before an abortion.

374
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,452
Good morning, everybody.
John Seago with tech...

375
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:36,373
We think very deliberately about what are
we doing that is taking a step forward

376
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,418
to challenging the very foundations
of Roe v. Wade.

377
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:42,504
And the sonogram bill was an important one
because we were pushing how much

378
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,923
we can require a physician to do.

379
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:49,386
All right. So Chapter 171 of the Texas
Health and Safety Code require that

380
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:53,098
I provide you with this information
at least 24 hours prior to your procedure.

381
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:56,017
We wanted the sonogram
not just to be performed,

382
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,812
for the sake of the abortionist,
but also to be displayed

383
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,064
for the woman to see.
That was the whole goal.

384
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,774
This little blurry thing right here.

385
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,652
If you focus kind of right there
and you see a little flicker.

386
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:08,113
-Yeah.
-That's the heartbeat. Cardiac activity.

387
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,240
The law says
a doctor has to describe

388
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,659
what she sees on the screen
to the patient,

389
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,619
giving her a chance to change her mind,

390
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:18,748
to see the error of her ways
and realize what she's about to do.

391
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,417
That's the idea.

392
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:25,046
This is the state
imposing it upon the woman.

393
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,550
She has engaged a doctor
to discuss this with her

394
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,470
and help her come to a resolution.

395
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,014
She did not engage
the legislature of the state of Texas.

396
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,810
It is the strong conviction
of Texas Right to Life

397
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:42,022
that the legislature should work
to stop abortions.

398
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:47,110
In the capitol, we have the capacity
to direct the conversation.

399
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:52,657
All elective abortion is a violent act
of injustice and should be rejected.

400
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,950
Hey.

401
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,120
If you're running in Texas
as a Republican...

402
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:00,665
An inhumane action
to a human child in the womb.

403
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:04,294
...you have to claim to agree
with pro-life principles.

404
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:08,048
Sid Miller helped pass powerful
legislation to protect the unborn.

405
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,592
Thank you and God bless.

406
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,220
You can be elected
as agriculture commissioner.

407
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:18,850
You can be elected as the chief financial
officer of our state because of abortion.

408
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,186
Not because of your skills with numbers.

409
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:25,232
We must pass one of the strongest
pieces of pro-life legislation.

410
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,525
But because of your skill

411
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:30,362
at getting legislation passed
to obstruct access to abortion.

412
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:33,240
That's how powerful
this issue is in Texas.

413
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:37,536
That's how powerful pro-life
advocacy groups have become.

414
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:43,375
I signed a sonogram law so mothers facing
that agonizing choice can actually see.

415
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,669
And I know it...

416
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,712
works.

417
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:57,055
We want to see all unborn children
protected, and we believe that

418
00:25:57,138 --> 00:26:00,642
what we've been doing is still
the best way to approach it.

419
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,895
Yet another round in
the abortion battle has been fought on...

420
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:07,107
But our roadblock
has always been the Supreme Court.

421
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,484
The Court declined
to overrule Roe versus Wade.

422
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,654
 We're gonna keep plugging away
to overturn Roe v. Wade

423
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,907
because we believe this country
shouldn't be killing its babies.

424
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,415
Is it a legal question,
a constitutional question,

425
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,750
a medical question,
a philosophical question,

426
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,378
a religious question, or what is it?

427
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,882
There had been other cases
around the country

428
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,635
trying to challenge local abortion laws.

429
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:41,266
But our case was the first
to get to the US Supreme Court.

430
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,770
The law in Texas was that abortion
was illegal,

431
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:50,066
and we had a woman who was
already pregnant who didn't want to be...

432
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,236
and she didn't want her name public.

433
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:57,490
So, we thought,
"Well, John Doe, Jane Roe."

434
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,286
And Henry Wade
was the district attorney in Dallas.

435
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:07,667
And it was clear that so many women
were affected by this issue.

436
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:14,549
There was a flight that left Dallas
every Thursday going to California,

437
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:18,011
and there were usually ten
or a few more women on that flight

438
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:22,349
going out to California for abortion.
People were going to Colorado.

439
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,560
And a lot of people
were flying to New York.

440
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:31,733
And there were thousands of women
who had had illegal abortion,

441
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,235
who had done their own abortion.

442
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,238
And so we filed a class action

443
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:42,452
to say that this is a case for all women
who are or might become pregnant

444
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:45,413
and want the option of abortion.

445
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,874
I was 26.

446
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:52,587
And I was the youngest person ever
to argue a case in the Supreme Court.

447
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,548
We are not here to advocate abortion.

448
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:59,010
We do not ask this court to rule
that abortion is good,

449
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,262
or desirable in any particular situation.

450
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:06,059
We are here to advocate for the right
of a woman to determine whether or not

451
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,561
she would continue
or terminate a pregnancy.

452
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:14,067
Roe against Wade was argued
to nine middle-aged-to-elderly men.

453
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,237
It was a conservative Court.

454
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,533
It was a Court with four Nixon appointees.

455
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,618
Their presence is expected
to make the Court

456
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,663
more conservative than at any time
in recent memory.

457
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:29,708
But abortion was not
a partisan issue at that time.

458
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,544
It was a medical problem,
it was a social problem.

459
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,629
Basic constitutional question is

460
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,590
whether or not an unborn fetus
is a person, isn't it?

461
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,428
At one point
a justice had said to me,

462
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,180
"When do you believe human life begins?"

463
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,599
And I said, "Well, Your Honor,

464
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:50,061
we did not try to say exactly
what moment that was."

465
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,231
There is no one answer to that.

466
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:57,360
Different religions
have different answers to that question,

467
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,405
but there is no legal standard that said,

468
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,616
"At this point the fetus becomes a human."

469
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,287
So, the question is,
who gets to make the decision?

470
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,414
Is it the woman,

471
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,416
or is it the government?

472
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:15,253
And my position has always been
it's not the government.

473
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,756
Good evening. In a landmark ruling,

474
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,092
the Supreme Court today
legalized abortion.

475
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,677
The Court split seven to two

476
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,513
with Justices Byron White
and William Rehnquist dissenting.

477
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,808
The decision made abortion
largely a private matter

478
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,603
and ordered the states
to make no laws forbidding it, except possibly during the final months.

479
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,901
When Roe went through,
it was a shock to everyone.

480
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,987
To go so far over to the other side,

481
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,282
to put everything in the woman's hand
and essentially dismantle the laws.

482
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:47,327
Now, in any other state,
you couldn't pass laws against abortion,

483
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,287
not forbidding it directly.

484
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,663
It was a constitutional right.

485
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,875
The Roe decision held

486
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,753
that women have the right
to terminate a pregnancy

487
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,671
in the first two trimesters,

488
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,716
and then it's only at the third trimester

489
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,636
that the state has the right
to prohibit abortion

490
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:09,224
except when necessary to preserve
a woman's life or health.

491
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,561
When the Roe v. Wade decision
was handed down,

492
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:17,607
Planned Parenthood had been devoted
to women's reproductive health

493
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,319
and access to contraception.

494
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:24,197
And the local chapters
had to ask themselves,

495
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,992
"Are we gonna provide abortions
now that they are legal?"

496
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:31,454
It was really a moment of reflection

497
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,832
that was very tough
for the organization.

498
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,667
March 11th is...

499
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,293
When it first became legal,

500
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,213
Planned Parenthood was not keen
on abortion.

501
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,174
Various affiliates around the country,

502
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:47,095
a lot of them didn't want to do abortions.
They really didn't.

503
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,763
The board would be divided.

504
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,266
Half the people would want to,
the other half wouldn't.

505
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,602
Now, after the doctor's
examined you and everything is all right,

506
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,314
the first thing he's going to do
is use the speculum. This is the...

507
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:02,360
But one by one,
they swung over to the active side.

508
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:07,365
And when they did, the people who didn't
like abortion would resign from the board

509
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:10,243
and other people would come on,
and it's committed now,

510
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:14,080
committed to this right,
given by the Roe v. Wade decision. No court opinion
can change the law of God.

511
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:22,380
Every legal possibility must be explored

512
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:26,217
to challenge the opinion
of the United States Supreme Court.

513
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,387
Life begins at conception.

514
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,265
Protect the life of the unborn.

515
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:37,478
So, as long as there was
no New York law or no Roe v. Wade,

516
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,648
the woman was really, you know, an outlaw.

517
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,861
She was moving around, trying to get
some procedure that was against the law.

518
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,113
And nobody really tried
to stop her very much.

519
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,408
But when the Court said,

520
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:54,787
"You have the right to make this decision.
You have the right to define your life.

521
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,372
Not religion."

522
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:01,127
That was unacceptable.

523
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,340
Get out!

524
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,383
There won't be any murder here today.

525
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,763
So, the Catholics were already
involved with various pro-life things.

526
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:17,477
But for Operation Rescue,
the genesis really was more evangelical.

527
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:21,230
We rejoice, Lord. Hallelujah.
Glory to God.

528
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,484
The name comes from Proverbs 24:11.

529
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:29,656
The Biblical verse that says,
"Rescue those unjustly sentenced to die."

530
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,491
Someone else
can be hooked up to this pipe.

531
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:35,244
There'll be no abortions in here today.
No abortions in here today.

532
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,162
Amen.

533
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,872
And so our motto was,

534
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:42,835
"We're here to rescue the innocent child
sentenced to die today."

535
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,254
People out into the street.
There's hundreds more...

536
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,091
It was a very immediate thing.

537
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:51,302
Almost militaristic. Operation Rescue.

538
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,429
We're here to rescue these babies.

539
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,056
The judges, the politicians,

540
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,183
they're getting the signal,
as is Planned Parenthood.

541
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,104
Legalized child killing's days
are numbered. We will win.

542
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,398
This is a phenomenon.

543
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:09,028
It was really an outworking
of our Christian faith.

544
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,912
So, this is the epicenter
of Operation Rescue.

545
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:20,081
This is a former abortion clinic.

546
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,501
We actually took this place
that was an abortion mill.

547
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:28,256
We closed it down, we remodeled it,
and now we've made it our headquarters.

548
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,717
Before we closed the place down,

549
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,928
the property line
is right down on this crack.

550
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,680
And we would stand right here

551
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,266
and minister to the women
that were going in this abortion clinic.

552
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,227
If we stepped over the line,
we'd be arrested.

553
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,563
Just like that, be arrested.

554
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,569
Operation Rescue
has targeted Wichita

555
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,362
with virtually all of its resources,

556
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:55,700
attempting to close
the city's three abortion clinics.

557
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,163
Thousands of people
came to Wichita,

558
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,040
and that's because of George Tiller.

559
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:05,334
George Tiller's Women's
Health Care Services clinic

560
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:09,797
is just one of three in the nation
which perform late-term abortions.

561
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:15,219
The issue is a moral imperative
from God Almighty

562
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,930
to rescue those led to slaughter.

563
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,683
The pro-life movement here
looks bigger than ever.

564
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:25,229
Federal marshals were escorting patients
through the protesters, into the clinic.

565
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:32,737
Operation Rescue
had really caused a shutdown in that city.

566
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:38,367
And I received a message saying
that Phil Donahue wants you to do

567
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,328
a show in Wichita,

568
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:43,664
and he wants to do it with Randall Terry.

569
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:47,543
And so, you know, to go to Wichita
in the midst of this,

570
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,546
we were kind of going
into the belly of the beast.

571
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,674
Faye Wattleton, I'm saying this to you.

572
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,260
You have betrayed your race.

573
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,222
When you think-- Absolutely.

574
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,933
To say that abortion for black women

575
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,393
is somehow a favor to them
to kill their offspring...

576
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,022
To be characterized
as being engaged in black genocide

577
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,192
is just what it is.
It's incendiary rhetoric

578
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,153
that was designed to inflame the debate.

579
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,198
-Let me finish, Faye.
-I do not need you

580
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:20,368
to tell me what my choices are
about my life

581
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,037
and my body
because I am a black person.

582
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,414
Planned Parenthood does
a hundred thousand abortions a year.

583
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:29,043
They've killed more children
than any organization in the country.

584
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:33,631
I think this really is
about women's status in society,

585
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:38,010
controlling women's behavior
and the limits of that behavior.

586
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,596
Any contraceptive
that is an abortive agent,

587
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,100
such as the IUD or the pill,
I believe should be banned.

588
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:48,229
Mr. Terry has in fact revealed
the ultimate agenda

589
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:51,732
-of Operation Rescue and all of its type.
-No.

590
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,405
The emotion
and the hot emotion is around abortion.

591
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,241
It's murder, Phil.
That's what we have laws for.

592
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:05,580
It raises a lot of conflict
around sexuality, and...

593
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,875
without any question, it's formidable.

594
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:12,295
…must be decided by the woman
and her physician,

595
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:16,465
and not by Randall Terry and other people
trying to make that decision.

596
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:21,095
But the ultimate decider here
must remain women.

597
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,264
And that's what we're really fighting for.

598
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,974
If abortion is illegal,

599
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:28,644
what happens to those who perform
the abortion? Mr. Terry?

600
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:32,356
Let me say this. Dr. George Tiller's
gonna do hard time when this is all over.

601
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,027
He is a mass murderer.
He is an enemy of humanity.

602
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:42,241
The abortion battle
has taken a violent turn.

603
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,870
It was just one round after another.
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

604
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,872
Dr. George Tiller shot by a protester. We take no blame for this.

605
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,418
The blame rests
with the child-killing industry.

606
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:56,964
They're the ones that are killing children
and breeding such frustration in people.

607
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:01,010
We didn't know where the gunshots was
coming from. Just shootin' and shootin'.

608
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,679
Two women were killed in Boston.

609
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:08,935
A doctor was killed in Pensacola.
Then a doctor and an escort were killed.

610
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,814
Two bombs rocked
an abortion clinic in Atlanta.

611
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:17,485
Every abortion clinic is a potential
target for those who would do this.

612
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:23,282
And at that point, I think, there was
a gravity that came out of the movement.

613
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:27,536
We lost another doctor in '98.

614
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,332
And we lost Dr. Tiller... in 2009.

615
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:35,169
Dr. George Tiller was shot dead
at his church in Wichita, Kansas.

616
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,588
A man shot him
in the Lutheran church,

617
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,090
in cold blood.

618
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:42,134
The suspect is in custody,
and right now the police...

619
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,553
And you really
have to think about this,

620
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,305
that you would do this kind of thing.

621
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:51,269
That's really astonishing.
That's just astonishing.

622
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,105
Did there come a point in time
where your faith,

623
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,065
your religious beliefs changed?

624
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,817
Yes.

625
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,612
I had been watching
The 700 Club regularly.

626
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:06,409
'Cause that baby is made
in the image of God Almighty.

627
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:10,663
I was alone in my living room, and...

628
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:15,543
that day I kneeled down and I did
accept Christ as my savior at that time.

629
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,171
Religion can
make people crazy. It really can.

630
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:26,012
And it can be wonderful, but it can
also be just incredibly intolerant.

631
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,888
All those people who shot

632
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,976
these people at the clinics and so on,
they were all religious.

633
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,077
The tie that
this clinic has to Dr. Tiller

634
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,329
is really important to me.

635
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:56,542
You know, that even in the face
of assassinating one of our providers,

636
00:38:56,625 --> 00:39:00,421
we were still gonna provide that care
because women still deserve that care.

637
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:07,511
And we do a checkup for you,
make sure everything's okay.

638
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:08,429
Right.

639
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,390
There's a lot of traumatic memory of

640
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,809
things that have happened
in the abortion movement,

641
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,854
of clinics being bombed,
providers being targeted.

642
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:20,107
You are a killer,
condemning your own soul to hell.

643
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,612
You know, the potential
that your family will be targeted.

644
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:28,157
Dr. Johnson
has been killing children in our city.

645
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:32,536
That people may show up
at your home or at your kids' school.

646
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:37,666
And you layer all of this difficulty
of actually practicing medicine

647
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:43,047
with the threat to safety
or harm to you or your family,

648
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,925
it becomes a really difficult choice
to make for many people.

649
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,389
And one of the strategies
of the antichoice movement

650
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,099
is to shame people.

651
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,267
They kill your baby.
They won't let you...

652
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,937
People who provide abortions
and people who have abortions.

653
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,939
If you don't kill your baby!

654
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,567
If you think about controlling when and if

655
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,237
and how many children somebody has,

656
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:11,242
it's sort of the absolute
demonstration of patriarchy.

657
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,621
Because controlling
people's fertility can affect

658
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:19,041
what education they can get
and what career they can have

659
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,168
and sort of how far they can go in life.

660
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,967
The weak link

661
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,845
in the abortion chain

662
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:34,306
is the person doing the actual abortions.

663
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,184
And there's fewer and fewer abortionists

664
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,979
that are doing them
here in the United States.

665
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:43,190
And they're retiring
and they're moving on.

666
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,651
And so we've been very effective

667
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,320
in targeting particular abortionists.

668
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,781
If they don't have an abortionist,
the place closes down.

669
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:55,119
And when abortion clinics close,
babies get saved.

670
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:59,415
These are abortion clinics we've
closed down, put them out of business.

671
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:03,169
This is in San Diego, Oceanside.
Lawrence, Kansas.

672
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,255
I like to look at it as a trophy wall.

673
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,841
We have probably closed down hundreds

674
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:13,012
of abortion clinics,
and it's the one thing I'm most proud of.

675
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:25,107
Right now, there are seven states
that have only one abortion provider,

676
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,818
and those states have been under siege

677
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,613
in terms of restrictions
on women's health care.

678
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:36,410
So, we are constantly monitoring
the patterns in the states

679
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:40,748
in terms of legislation that restricts
women's access to abortion…

680
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:44,710
We've seen a lot of state moves
to defund abortion providers.

681
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:48,839
...thinking about what we need to do
to block legislation from passing.

682
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:51,050
We got that law preliminarily enjoined.

683
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:54,303
And then if it does pass,
we consider bringing a court challenge.

684
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,223
So, for Kentucky TRAP...

685
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,475
And Kentucky is a perfect example.

686
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:03,062
We are going to do the best that we can

687
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:05,606
to usher in a new day for Kentucky.

688
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,735
Before Governor Bevin took office,

689
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:13,489
there were three abortion providers
in Kentucky.

690
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,783
I'm unapologetically pro-life.

691
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:21,288
And he sprung right into action
to pick off abortion clinics one by one.

692
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:25,084
Governor Matt Bevin has ordered
a Louisville Planned Parenthood clinic

693
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,169
to stop performing abortions immediately.

694
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,840
For the second time, Bevin administration
has sued a clinic over abortion.

695
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,717
And we gave them
an immediate cease and desist.

696
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,303
We said that we would seek
an injunction if necessary.

697
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,765
The Republicans now have
control of both the House, the Senate...

698
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:43,185
We had three abortion clinics.
We are now down to one.

699
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,647
And now Governor Bevin
is trying to shut down

700
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,483
the last remaining clinic,
EMW Women's Center.

701
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,903
...Bevin administration's
new rules for abortion clinics.

702
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:55,948
And at the ACLU, we think
what Governor Bevin is doing

703
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,575
is blatantly unconstitutional.

704
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,994
If a judge sides with
Governor Matt Bevin,

705
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:03,455
Kentucky will become
the only state in the nation

706
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,082
without an abortion clinic.

707
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,626
The situation in Kentucky
really is unprecedented.

708
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,671
We have never seen a situation
where we have been on the cusp

709
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,799
of a state that has no abortion provider.

710
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,801
It's incredibly dire for women.

711
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:21,557
Close this place down!
Governor Bevin, close this place down.

712
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,686
It's exciting to see
pro-life activity at

713
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,646
the last abortion clinic in Kentucky,

714
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,649
because I have been looking so forward

715
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,901
to the moment when we have
an abortion-free state.

716
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,614
And let's see if we can't put
the final nail in the coffin

717
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,198
of the abortion clinic there.

718
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:43,787
We in the Commonwealth of Kentucky
respect the sanctity of human life...

719
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,623
And Governor Bevin's been fantastic.

720
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:50,336
Republicans stand against abortion,
stand for the Ten Commandments,

721
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:53,130
and they stand for marriage
between a man and a woman.

722
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:58,218
And the Republican Party has
kind of become the party of morality.

723
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:02,348
And there's a war
for the heart and soul of America.

724
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:07,478
This debate is about little babies
who haven't given their consent,

725
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,731
and it's about time we said
enough is enough.

726
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,776
Nobody's saying
that Planned Parenthood can't be

727
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,986
the leading advocate
of abortion-on-demand in America,

728
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,488
but why do I have to pay for it?

729
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:21,325
Washington needs to defund them,
send a clear message.

730
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:24,495
I come here today
to ask my fellow senators

731
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,705
to vote to defund Planned Parenthood.

732
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,833
Because this language and
messaging

733
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,335
around defunding Planned Parenthood

734
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:32,961
has been so pervasive,

735
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,381
I think the general population believes

736
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,175
that defunding Planned Parenthood means

737
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,052
not paying for abortions.

738
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,805
But in fact, and by law,

739
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:46,225
no federal dollars go to pay for abortion.

740
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,185
Two and a half million patients

741
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,437
depend on Planned Parenthood
every single year

742
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,356
for birth control,

743
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,650
for testing and treatment
for sexually transmitted...

744
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:57,653
We don't want our tax dollars
going to that organization

745
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,572
for any service that they provide.

746
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:04,284
Planned Parenthood
is a mega abortion provider. It's about a third of all abortions
performed in this country

747
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:11,750
are done by that one organization.
We just see them as...

748
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,628
um, as baby killers.

749
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:18,173
Please join me in welcoming
the President of the United States,

750
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,466
Barack Obama.

751
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,343
And when it comes to abortion,

752
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:26,306
they pretty much get to control
the agenda in the Democratic Party.

753
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:30,018
Planned Parenthood is not going anywhere.
It's not going anywhere today,

754
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,770
it's not going anywhere tomorrow.

755
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,815
And it's a known fact.

756
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,609
Republicans will pass
pro-life legislation.

757
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:41,655
We voted to defund Planned Parenthood.

758
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,575
Republicans made huge gains,
not only in the House,

759
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,785
but in governors' races
and state legislative campaigns. We now have Republican...

760
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:55,711
majorities in state legislators
and I believe 33 Republican Governors.

761
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,797
We've had a game plan for many years,
we're following it,

762
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,632
and I think it's coming to fruition.

763
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:05,053
What's so important for us to stand up
for the cause of pro-life?

764
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:08,849
I cancelled their vacations and I brought
them back for a pro-life special session.

765
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,602
And I'm convinced
that we're going to get the job done.

766
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,856
The general assembly is
heavily Republican.

767
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,817
They have a two-thirds majority in both
Chambers.

768
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:26,366
I provide abortion care
in several clinics in the Midwest.

769
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:31,079
and the clinics have to be able to comply
with the layers and layers and layers

770
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,165
of regulations that have been put on them.

771
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:35,542
Legislation is on its way to the House

772
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,086
that would require inspections
of abortion clinics

773
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,798
and enact other new restrictions
on the procedure.

774
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,842
And now we're facing
more legislation, more regulations,

775
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:48,388
new bills being introduced,
new laws going into effect, and...

776
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:52,935
on an almost day-to-day basis,
what we can do might change.

777
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,479
Missouri lawmakers have
enacted one of the nation's

778
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:56,980
longest abortion waiting periods.

779
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,149
Governor Greitens calls
a special session.

780
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,609
State lawmakers are back--

781
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,986
And there's so much

782
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:06,114
factual inaccuracy in
these bills and in hearings,

783
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:10,077
I felt that somebody really needs
to be a voice.

784
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,539
A voice for medicine
and a voice for science.

785
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:18,418
Okay. Good afternoon.
I'm Dr. Colleen McNicholas. I'm an OB-GYN.

786
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,670
I practice in St. Louis.

787
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,048
There shouldn't be a pro-life
or pro-choice law.

788
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:26,510
There should be a law in healthcare policy
that is important and science-based.

789
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:30,722
-But every single time I've testified...
-Why is your opinion

790
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,058
so much different than theirs?

791
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:36,353
...lobbyists from the anti-choice group
will also testify.

792
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:40,107
-Here's some written testimony--
-And they can say whatever they want.

793
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,068
...case by case, to protect the health
and safety of women in Missouri.

794
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,612
Is it Dr. Lee?

795
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,239
No, Senator.

796
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,449
So, you're not a physician.
Are you a pathologist?

797
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,367
Not at all.

798
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,661
Which is infuriating.

799
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:57,499
Especially from sort of the standpoint
of science and evidence and...

800
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,418
just facts.

801
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:03,380
The abortion clinic in St. Louis
has not been complying with the law

802
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,424
in terms of turning over
complication reports.

803
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:09,511
Every year we have
dozens of pro-life bills introduced.

804
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:14,016
Lawmakers who come to me and say,
"Sam, what can I do?"

805
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:17,895
What type of bill can I introduce
to reduce abortions?"

806
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:23,358
It's a bit of a cat and mouse game
between the pro-life pro-choice side,

807
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,819
...is not turning in complication reports. Once again a bill on
abortion regulations

808
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,781
moved through the legislature.

809
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,658
They have to have a complication plan.

810
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,452
This is how I feel.

811
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:37,372
Okay? We're not
in the field of medicine here.

812
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:41,084
When did the government start approving
complication plans?

813
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:43,420
I thought the doctors
or the physicians would do that.

814
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:46,131
Our complaint is that
that should be for all clinics.

815
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:49,468
if abortion facilities have to comply
with certain things, then

816
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:53,972
so too should other clinics that are
providing similar levels of care.

817
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,516
Are you putting plans together
for anything else?

818
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,310
I mean, you could eat too much pork!

819
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,854
And have a gallstone
and you'd have to go through surgery.

820
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,606
Why is it that we're just doing this

821
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,651
when it comes to individuals
wanting to have an abortion?

822
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,987
-Well, I mean it is--
-It sounds so ridiculous.

823
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:12,783
Abortion is different
than just any other medical procedure.

824
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:15,869
I know that the Democrats
and Planned Parenthood

825
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,830
want to treat it that way. I know
they want to talk about in that way.

826
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,999
But talk to your average person
on the street.

827
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:24,169
And they're going to tell you
that abortion is not the same as having

828
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,129
a colonoscopy or having your tooth pulled.

829
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,590
It's something unique and different.

830
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,759
There is no other medical procedure, none,

831
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:34,346
not one, that is legislated
in the way that abortion is.

832
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,390
Enough is enough.

833
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,894
I'm ready to go down fighting,
because I'm tired of the Republican Party

834
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:45,607
bullying women when it comes
to their right to choose.

835
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,026
I'll tell you what.

836
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:52,656
I am proud to be with so many people
standing for life here in Missouri.

837
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:00,205
Message received. Thank you--

838
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,416
You know,
from the perspective of today,

839
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:06,670
I think it's important to remember that
abortion was not always so partisan and it wasn't always a requirement
for the Republicans to be pro-life.

840
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:18,432
In fact, it took years of cultivation...

841
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,934
We're concerned that
a million babies are dying...

842
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:24,855
...by very smart Republican strategists.

843
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:29,276
It took years to bring about
that kind of party realignment,

844
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,863
the placing of abortion
front-and-center as

845
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:35,824
a social, cultural issue in our politics.

846
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:39,619
We're concerned about the moral problems,
the breakdown of the family.

847
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:43,957
We've come to seek
the welfare of America's children.

848
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,709
God bless you and have a great day.

849
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:51,298
And it was accomplished in
the 1980s, by this coalition

850
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:55,969
of social and religious
and political conservatives.

851
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,681
And it was done
with the rise of Ronald Reagan.

852
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,854
The 1980 election is when abortion

853
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:10,484
really becomes a political issue
and particularly a Republican issue.

854
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,487
We have
a threefold primary responsibility.

855
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:16,448
Number one, get people saved.
Number two, get them baptized.

856
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:18,158
Number three,
get them registered to vote.

857
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:25,082
 Falwell saw evangelical Christians
as the basis for a political movement.

858
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:29,586
Falwell wanted to organize evangelical
voters, who up until that time

859
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,588
had not been politically active.

860
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:35,425
It's always seemed to me
we haven't improved by one iota

861
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,219
on the Ten Commandments.

862
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:43,517
Falwell and the religious right
identifies

863
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:47,854
Ronald Reagan as a candidate
who would push their agenda,

864
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,564
their socially conservative agenda.

865
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:52,442
Religious America is awakening,

866
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:55,987
perhaps just in time,
for our country's sake.

867
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:00,951
But what got evangelical leaders
interested in politics

868
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:03,286
was this notion that the Bible

869
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:06,498
mandated the separation of the races.

870
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:11,294
And several so-called segregation
academies were applying

871
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,380
for tax-exempt status.

872
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:18,301
And the district court ruled
that any organization that engages

873
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:21,221
in racial segregation, or discrimination,

874
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,515
cannot claim tax-exempt status.

875
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:26,810
That was the catalyst

876
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,688
for the religious right
becoming politically active.

877
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,064
We have a fight going on...

878
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:35,318
on the question of tax exemptions
for Christian schools.

879
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:39,322
Paul Weyrich
was one of the chief strategists of

880
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,740
the New Right movement.

881
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,285
Questions involved
are religious liberty questions.

882
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:48,415
It was a movement that said
we are going to win the presidency

883
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:52,752
through bigotry, but we are not going
to come right out and say it.

884
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,046
This coming election's gonna be
a big test for us...

885
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:59,050
This election is to make America
great again.

886
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:01,803
I have told the Republicans

887
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:05,307
that you are loyal to a certain set
of moral precepts

888
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,892
in which you deeply believe.

889
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:10,812
Weyrich recognized
the electoral potential

890
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:15,358
of evangelical voters,
but he needed a populist issue

891
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:19,404
that would appeal more generally
to religious voters.

892
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,698
And he was savvy enough to recognize

893
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:25,243
that overt racism probably wouldn't work
on a wide scale.

894
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:33,418
The pro-family movement
and the American people do not want

895
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:38,340
the women's lib ideology forced
upon all the rest of us.

896
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,927
Phyllis Schlafly had been able
to mobilize

897
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,554
voters around moral issues.

898
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,057
Well, I am certainly opposed to abortion,

899
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,267
because I think it's killing
an unborn child.

900
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,855
And as the presidential election
begins to take shape...

901
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:56,066
What are the key issues?
In our judgment,

902
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:57,317
the right to life,

903
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:00,779
protect the unborn. These are key issues.

904
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,323
Weyrich says, in effect,

905
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:04,991
"We found our issue.

906
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:09,162
Abortion is going to work for us
as a political issue."

907
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:13,166
Millions of unborn defenseless babies...

908
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,085
When you are trying to

909
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:20,006
change the dynamic
of the political system in the country,

910
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:24,177
you have to do it
through emotional issues.

911
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,722
In our Washington studios
is Jerry Falwell.

912
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:31,810
America has violated the principle
of the dignity of life since 1973.

913
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:34,646
And we're very strongly pro-life.
Our first order of business--

914
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:38,400
And what is more emotional
than motherhood and babies?

915
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:44,781
At that point the Reagan campaign begins
to embrace abortion as a political issue.

916
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:45,865
I believe that...

917
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:50,036
that when you interrupt the pregnancy,
you are taking a human life.

918
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,498
Which they ride through
the 1980 election.

919
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,544
 It's interesting.
One of the nation's leading pollsters

920
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,255
says Reagan is winning the votes
of the white electors,

921
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:03,425
who are followers
of the evangelical preachers,

922
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:06,511
the so-called Moral Majority,
who have been active in the election.

923
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,807
This group is providing Reagan
with his clear margin

924
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,101
in the election.
Ronald Reagan's overwhelming victory...

925
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:22,777
Reagan won 44 states,
with 479 electoral votes.

926
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:28,700
They set out to change
the dynamic in the Republican party.

927
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:33,663
So they nominated somebody
that would be useful. And they succeeded.

928
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,879
It was now eight years
after Roe versus Wade.

929
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,841
And it seemed
like the future of ending abortion

930
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,801
was going to be in the Republican party.

931
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:49,387
And Reagan really gave a lot of hope
to the pro-life community.

932
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,892
Can a person be a Christian
and support federal funding of abortion?

933
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:57,354
I believe in an abortion
you are taking a human life.

934
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:01,649
If you believe that, it very definitely
has a religious connotation.

935
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:05,362
He just reaffirmed his support of

936
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:08,073
everything the pro-life
movement represents.

937
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,159
There's never been any question
that he was with us.

938
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:13,328
We love life! We want life!

939
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:15,914
In the mind of the pro-life
community, the right to abortion

940
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,874
was an aberration in the law.

941
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,293
So, with the election of President Reagan,

942
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:24,589
we thought the next step would be
to try to reverse Roe versus Wade.

943
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:28,051
We want life!

944
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:35,892
It is the Supreme Court
that has abolished prayer

945
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:38,561
and the Ten Commandments
from the public schools.

946
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:43,400
It is Supreme Court decisions

947
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:47,862
that have brought upon us forced busing
and put our children on buses

948
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,782
and send them across town to some school

949
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:53,118
that their parents don't want them
to go to.

950
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:55,412
It is Supreme Court decisions

951
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,914
that have unleashed the pornography

952
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:01,167
that has invaded our newsstands
and our television.

953
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,420
It is Supreme Court decisions

954
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:07,799
that have abolished capital punishment
and deterrents against crime.

955
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:12,011
And, of course,
it is the Supreme Court decision

956
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:15,932
that has brought about
this tragic evil of our time.

957
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:19,519
A Supreme Court decision, in 1973,

958
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:24,816
that invented this new right of a woman
to kill her unborn baby.

959
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:29,154
If abortion is
a constitutional right,

960
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:32,282
the most important thing was
to overturn Roe versus Wade.

961
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:35,660
In order to do that, you had to change
the justices on the Court.

962
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:36,870
There's no other way.

963
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:42,125
You need, as quickly as possible,
a reconstituting of the Supreme Court.

964
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:45,795
We just didn't think that the current
justices would have changed their minds.

965
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,589
I will send to the Senate

966
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:51,009
the nomination
of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor, of Arizona.

967
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,761
The first woman on
the Supreme Court,

968
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,096
Judge Sandra Day O'Connor.

969
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:59,767
She told the Senate today
that she is firmly opposed to abortion.

970
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:03,146
In the area of abortion is
that I am opposed to it

971
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:06,232
as a matter of birth control.

972
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,776
So, President Reagan
appointed O'Connor,

973
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:12,322
then appointed Justice Scalia
and Justice Kennedy.

974
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:16,284
And in the pro-life community there was
the hope that Roe versus Wade

975
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:17,827
may get overturned.

976
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:21,331
And we thought the Court was moving
much closer in that direction.

977
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,166
Are you getting the feeling

978
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:27,253
that some sort of movement is under way
that would ultimately erode Roe v. Wade?

979
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:30,381
I'm not only getting a feeling.
I'm part of it.

980
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:33,593
- It's happened?
- It's happening.

981
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:37,680
The Americans United for Life
is one of the main players in this.

982
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:43,394
They have a strategy of one anti-abortion
restriction at a time

983
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:47,315
which could pass state legislatures
and maybe get up to the Supreme Court

984
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,025
and overturn Roe against Wade.

985
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,320
And it looked
like it actually might happen

986
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:54,822
in an abortion case in 1989.

987
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:59,869
But Justice O'Connor surprised the world
by sustaining Roe against Wade.

988
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,372
And that was a matter of

989
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:05,959
extreme frustration
to the Court's conservatives.

990
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,587
I think Justice O'Connor
didn't want to be

991
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,589
the first and lone woman on the Court

992
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:14,384
taking away
a settled constitutional right.

993
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,844
And so she upheld Roe versus Wade.

994
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:21,849
But Justice Blackmun made
a very, very important statement, and he read it from the bench and he said,
"Roe versus Wade is hanging by a thread.

995
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:28,523
We are in a very tenuous circumstance.

996
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:31,734
We're only one vote away.
The next case could do it."

997
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:35,780
And after that,
the political situation really changed.

998
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:40,451
Like a thousand points of light
in a broad and peaceful sky.

999
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:43,663
When H.W. became president,

1000
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:47,750
we thought that he would be
a pro-choice president.

1001
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:53,298
Abortion divides. We have room
in our party for people that feel

1002
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:56,509
one way, pro-life, or pro-choice.

1003
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,595
This is an issue that divides.

1004
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:01,222
When he was a congressman,

1005
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:06,102
he had been known as a big supporter
of family planning, to the point that

1006
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,730
some of his colleagues
called him "Rubbers."

1007
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:11,858
Do you favor a constitutional
amendment against abortion?

1008
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:13,860
I oppose such an amendment.

1009
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,821
The 35th Republican National Convention.

1010
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:18,698
What's the big challenge here this week?

1011
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,534
I really don't know. I-- Abortion, mostly.

1012
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:25,330
People really need to understand
that the pro-lifers

1013
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:28,750
are now the backbone that is holding up
George Bush.

1014
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:32,503
George Bush has to take
a strong pro-family position.

1015
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:36,007
And frankly, that means
a strong position on abortion.

1016
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,012
And Bush turned against choice,

1017
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:46,059
and he took on a position
that was stronger than...

1018
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,020
than anything Reagan ever did.

1019
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:52,065
I believe that abortion is wrong.

1020
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:56,527
I believe that we should work
to overturn Roe vs. Wade.

1021
01:00:57,070 --> 01:01:00,698
And I believe that states should have
the right to prohibit abortions.

1022
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,951
 I don't make many guarantees,
but I'll make you one.

1023
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:06,663
Pennsylvania will be
the first state in the Union

1024
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,499
to end the nightmare once and for all
and to outlaw abortion.

1025
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:13,544
Supreme Court case number 91-744.

1026
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,964
Planned Parenthood
of Southeast Pennsylvania versus Casey.

1027
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,050
Planned Parenthood versus Casey.

1028
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:22,095
That went up to the Supreme Court
in 1992.

1029
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:25,264
...one of the most
restrictive abortion laws in the nation.

1030
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,142
And a lot of pro-life people thought
this was going to be the case

1031
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:29,727
that would overturn Roe versus Wade.

1032
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,481
The Bush administration asked
the Supreme Court

1033
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:37,652
to support further limitations
on a woman's right to have an abortion.

1034
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:40,363
President Bush
has done all he can do

1035
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:44,617
to ensure that my arguments
are likely to fall on deaf ears.

1036
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:48,413
 I was totally convinced
that we were going to lose.

1037
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:50,373
For he has packed the Court

1038
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:55,461
with justices who are hostile to a woman's
fundamental right to choose abortion.

1039
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:58,214
Abortion litigation is a lot
like Sesame Street.

1040
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,549
You got to learn to count.

1041
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,260
And the only number
that's important is five.

1042
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:04,178
Are there five votes on the Supreme Court?

1043
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,472
Five votes that would overturn Roe.

1044
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:10,101
He is the best person for this position.

1045
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:13,980
The president nominated Clarence Thomas
to the Supreme Court.

1046
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:17,775
And I thought he would be the fifth vote
to overrule Roe.

1047
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:26,492
And I remember there was a silence
in the courtroom that was palpable.

1048
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,162
Ms. Kolbert.

1049
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,497
Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court.

1050
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:36,252
Whether our Constitution endows
government with the power to force a woman

1051
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:39,255
to continue or to end a pregnancy
against her will

1052
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:41,674
is the central question in this case.

1053
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:46,637
And then the Solicitor General
of the United States stood up and argued

1054
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:49,432
that Roe versus Wade
ought to be overturned.

1055
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:53,394
...the State does have
a compelling interest

1056
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:59,233
in the potential life, in fetal life, and
that interest runs throughout pregnancy.

1057
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:02,945
But I wanted the Court
to understand the implications

1058
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:07,575
of changing a standard
that was very protective for women.

1059
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:11,204
This Court has recognized
that the rights of autonomy,

1060
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:16,459
bodily integrity, and equality are central
to our notions of ordered liberty.

1061
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:19,629
Roe lies at the heart of those interests.

1062
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,256
Because, ultimately,

1063
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,759
abortion is not about whether or not

1064
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:27,887
women should have
particular medical procedures.

1065
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,055
It's about equality.

1066
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:33,184
It's about a view of life,
about who should make important decisions.

1067
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:39,148
It's very rare that you know the date

1068
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:41,651
that the Supreme Court is going
to issue a decision.

1069
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:45,488
You know that the case will be decided,
but you don't know when.

1070
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:50,201
But this time we knew when,
because every other case

1071
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:53,204
that they heard that term
had already been decided.

1072
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,457
We're waiting outside
the Supreme Court now

1073
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:58,751
for the announcement
of the Court's decision.

1074
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:03,840
So, there were media trucks
parked outside.

1075
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:08,636
Everybody was ready and waiting
for the overturning of Roe.

1076
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,099
Release 91-45 Standing Orders.

1077
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:18,229
The clerk of the court handed me
a copy of the decision.

1078
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:21,524
And frankly I was confused
in many respects.

1079
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:24,652
You know, it's a 50, 60 page opinion.
It's complicated.

1080
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:26,612
You have to read it and understand it.

1081
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:30,366
At the same time,
I'm shepherded out to talk to

1082
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,536
American media about what just happened.

1083
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,582
I am Kathryn Kolbert.
I am counsel of record on behalf of

1084
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:41,335
Planned Parenthood and the other
abortion clinics in Pennsylvania.

1085
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:43,212
It was a very ambiguous decision.

1086
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:46,716
Three Republican-appointed justices
had gotten together,

1087
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:51,220
and they decided that
rather than overturn Roe against Wade,

1088
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:52,930
they were going to reformulate it...

1089
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,559
with what they called
the undue burden standard.

1090
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,771
So the Court upheld the right to abortion.

1091
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:05,318
But the new standard meant
that states can undertake

1092
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:09,780
to persuade a woman to carry
a pregnancy to term,

1093
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:14,201
but they cannot prevent a woman
from choosing abortion.

1094
01:05:14,952 --> 01:05:16,245
Under Roe versus Wade,

1095
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:19,457
most abortion restrictions
were unconstitutional.

1096
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:22,960
In Casey, the Court basically said that

1097
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:27,673
states had the latitude to restrict
abortion in more ways than under Roe.

1098
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:31,719
Many, many kinds of restrictions,
waiting periods, informed consent.

1099
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:36,766
Things found unconstitutional under Roe
have been validated by this Court.

1100
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:41,020
And therefore we are much worse off
than we have been in the past.

1101
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:44,565
At the time, I thought, you know,
this is really horrible.

1102
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:46,734
...to place roadblocks
in the path of women...

1103
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:50,947
But whatever problems
the undue burden standard gave us,

1104
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:54,992
it was still preferable
than a total outlaw of abortion.

1105
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:57,370
For a woman in need
of a medical procedure,

1106
01:05:57,828 --> 01:06:00,247
there's a big difference between having
to jump through hoops

1107
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:02,249
and not being able
to get the procedure at all.

1108
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:07,463
Four justices have said
Roe versus Wade must be overturned.

1109
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,257
All it's going to take is one more

1110
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:13,427
and I can only hope
that President Bush gets reelected.

1111
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:22,603
It makes a difference
whether the president believes

1112
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:25,439
in a woman's right to choose. And I do.

1113
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:29,986
There was some momentum

1114
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:34,281
around the Clintons
and support for abortion rights.

1115
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:38,077
I am proud to nominate
Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to

1116
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,120
the Supreme Court.

1117
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:43,582
It is essential to woman's equality
with man

1118
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,918
that she be the decision-maker.

1119
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:49,171
I'm proud to nominate
Judge Stephen Breyer

1120
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:51,298
to serve on the United States
Supreme Court.

1121
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:53,801
And there were bills pending
at the federal level

1122
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:56,512
to protect access to abortion.

1123
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:01,017
The Clinton team has begun
to systematically wage war

1124
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:02,685
against unborn children.

1125
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:06,981
And abortion opponents were looking
for a way to stop this momentum.

1126
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,735
So they came up with this new idea and they honed in on later abortion.

1127
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:16,866
Specifically they came up
with the term "partial birth abortion."

1128
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:25,124
Some of you stay on this side,
some of you go on the other side, okay?

1129
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:30,004
Not everyone. Try and spread out and get
the signs as many places as possible. Partial birth took off like
wildfire inside the pro-life movement.

1130
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:38,387
It so horrified and shocked the conscience

1131
01:07:38,929 --> 01:07:41,432
and stripped this veil of respectability

1132
01:07:41,515 --> 01:07:43,684
from Planned Parenthood
and the abortionists.

1133
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:46,562
It's terrible. Which side of the fence
are we gonna be on?

1134
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:48,272
We had to educate the public.

1135
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:51,776
Are we gonna continue to support child
killing in America and call it choice?

1136
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:56,030
We made it an issue.
We forced it on America.

1137
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:01,077
This is partial birth abortion.

1138
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:05,498
The abortionist grabs the live baby's legs
with forceps.

1139
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:09,251
The Republicans introduced
the partial birth abortion law,

1140
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:11,378
even though there's no such thing.

1141
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:14,965
They made up the word
and it was a strategy

1142
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:17,134
that really went to challenging

1143
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:20,054
the question of when late abortion
would be permitted.

1144
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:24,058
With the idea that,
if you could push it earlier and earlier,

1145
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:26,685
you could eliminate a number of abortions

1146
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:30,773
And we knew immediately
that this was going to be a huge issue.

1147
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:34,610
Abortion advocates are claiming that,
by banning partial-birth abortion,

1148
01:08:34,693 --> 01:08:37,446
we are mounting a direct attack
on Roe versus Wade.

1149
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:41,408
For them, there is never an instance
when abortion is inappropriate.

1150
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:44,203
For them,
the right to abortion is absolute

1151
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:48,124
at whatever time, for whatever reason,
and in whatever way,

1152
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:50,376
a woman or an abortionist chooses.

1153
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:54,296
Ninety percent of women who have an
abortion have it in the first trimester.

1154
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,841
That's the vast majority of women.

1155
01:08:57,216 --> 01:09:00,511
And then a smaller proportion have it
before 20 weeks.

1156
01:09:01,178 --> 01:09:04,265
Between 20 and 24 weeks,
we're at probably about one percent.

1157
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:07,518
And then, as we get further along, we're
getting to smaller and smaller numbers,

1158
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:09,103
exceedingly low numbers.

1159
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:12,231
So the majority of abortions
are in the first trimester.

1160
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,900
But we spend most of our time
talking about

1161
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:17,361
abortions that happened
in the second and third trimester.

1162
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:20,739
And this is one of the strategies
of the anti-choice movement.

1163
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:23,033
Why do we call something
the partial-birth abortion,

1164
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:25,161
when really that's not a medical term.

1165
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:27,413
You always go after your enemy
where they're the weakest.

1166
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:31,292
And they know that,
once we win, in the ninth month,

1167
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:33,752
the rest of the card house
comes crumbling down.

1168
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:35,129
We destroy their arguments.

1169
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:37,965
They created a narrative that

1170
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:40,509
women late in pregnancies were

1171
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:44,722
killing their babies 'cause they,
you know, wanted to go to the gym instead.

1172
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:47,933
Totally false. Doesn't happen.

1173
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:52,813
But there's no 30-second sound bite
to counter that image.

1174
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:56,108
They were very good at creating optics,

1175
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:59,236
creating language that supported
their point of view.

1176
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:03,324
And so we had to figure out
how to challenge it politically.

1177
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:06,035
And we were able
to introduce President Clinton

1178
01:10:06,118 --> 01:10:09,955
to women who would be affected
by the law.

1179
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:11,248
Women who were

1180
01:10:11,832 --> 01:10:15,085
losing pregnancies very late
or finding themselves

1181
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:17,963
carrying a pregnancy
with very severe fetal anomalies.

1182
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:21,550
Good morning. I'd like to thank
the subcommittee for inviting me here.

1183
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:26,013
I went in for
a routine seven-month ultrasound.

1184
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:30,184
They were saying,
"This looks good. This looks good."

1185
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:33,354
Then suddenly, they got really quiet.

1186
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:35,189
The doctor said,

1187
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:38,984
"Your daughter has no eyes,
and her heart...

1188
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:42,863
and other major organs are also failing.

1189
01:10:44,156 --> 01:10:46,492
And your child will not live."

1190
01:10:50,454 --> 01:10:54,625
I remember just looking out the window.
I couldn't look at anybody.

1191
01:10:56,418 --> 01:11:01,674
So my mother-in-law asked, "Do we go on?
Does she have to go on?"

1192
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:07,221
This terrible problem affects
a few hundred Americans

1193
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:08,806
every year,

1194
01:11:09,723 --> 01:11:11,433
who desperately want their children,

1195
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:14,436
are trying to building families and are
trying to strengthen their families.

1196
01:11:15,312 --> 01:11:16,939
And they should not become

1197
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:19,566
pawns in a larger debate.

1198
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:22,111
And therefore I had no choice
but to veto the bill.

1199
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:25,739
- I vetoed it just a few minutes ago before I met with these families.
-  Bill Clinton vetoed it, but it really spread.

1200
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:34,873
And we started to see
new iterations of these bills,

1201
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:38,627
using slightly different language,
in order to withstand a legal challenge.

1202
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:45,592
It's a shame that child sacrifice
can be allowed in this country.

1203
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:50,764
We are being arrested for speaking
and showing the truth of abortion.

1204
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:52,308
Okay, careful. Walk carefully.

1205
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:54,893
We need to ban
partial-birth abortions. I believe

1206
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:57,146
banning partial-birth abortions would be

1207
01:11:57,229 --> 01:12:01,734
a positive step toward reducing
the number of abortions in America.

1208
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:06,613
We were able to get George W. Bush
elected with the promise that,

1209
01:12:06,697 --> 01:12:09,783
if we got another ban,
he'd pass it again and sign it.

1210
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:13,787
And he signed the federal ban into law,

1211
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:16,040
and it went to the Supreme Court.

1212
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:19,752
Hey, hey! Hi, ho!
Anti-choice has got to go!

1213
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:22,796
 The issue of abortion's
before the Supreme Court.

1214
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:27,343
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced
this morning that she will retire.

1215
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:30,763
Chief Justice William Rehnquist has died.

1216
01:12:30,971 --> 01:12:32,389
The nomination power is one

1217
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:34,475
of the most serious responsibilities
of a president.

1218
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,436
I will nominate Judge Roberts
to the Supreme Court.

1219
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:41,065
And Chief Justice Roberts will have
as his colleague

1220
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:43,108
a proud member of
The Federalist Society,

1221
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:45,486
Judge Sam Alito, Jr.

1222
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:50,074
In a 5-4 landmark decision,
the Court's new conservative majority

1223
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:52,493
today upheld a nationwide ban

1224
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:55,162
on a procedure critics call
partial-birth abortion.

1225
01:12:55,662 --> 01:12:58,624
In court, an angry
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg

1226
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:01,752
took the unusual step of
reading her dissent aloud.

1227
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:08,300
I strongly dissent from today's opinion.

1228
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:13,097
The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act
cannot be understood

1229
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:15,682
as anything other than an effort

1230
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:17,893
to chip away at a right

1231
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:20,604
declared in Roe v. Wade.

1232
01:13:24,441 --> 01:13:25,776
Roe versus Wade

1233
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:29,196
prevents us from prohibiting abortion.

1234
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:30,864
But it does allow us,

1235
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:33,826
the states, to...

1236
01:13:34,326 --> 01:13:36,453
do some things to protect life,

1237
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:41,375
if they can show there is
a compelling state interest.

1238
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:45,421
Governor Rick Perry wanted to end
access to reproductive health care.

1239
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:48,757
And because the legislature is
so disproportionately

1240
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,301
uh, led by the Republican party,

1241
01:13:51,718 --> 01:13:55,931
they proposed abortion restrictions, which
were the most extreme in the country.

1242
01:13:57,349 --> 01:14:02,146
House Bill 2 was a good example of these
kinds of laws that were being passed in

1243
01:14:02,646 --> 01:14:04,648
many states controlled by the Republicans.

1244
01:14:05,065 --> 01:14:08,527
Laws that really focused
on where the abortion could be performed

1245
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:13,073
and regulations to either the doctor's
office or a surgical center.

1246
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:15,534
Thank you for calling
the Southwestern Women's Surgery Center.

1247
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,327
This is Alicia. How may I help you?

1248
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:19,997
This is what are known as TRAP laws: Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers.

1249
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:27,629
And the purpose of these laws is
to make it as difficult as possible

1250
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:29,214
to provide abortion services,

1251
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:31,758
prohibit as many abortions as you can,

1252
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:34,219
make the ones that do occur
as expensive as possible.

1253
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:35,846
It's so obvious what they're doing.

1254
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,434
My goal is to make abortion,

1255
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:43,562
at any stage, a thing of the past.

1256
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:50,152
So these restrictions would shut down
dozens of women's health centers

1257
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:51,487
all across Texas.

1258
01:14:52,112 --> 01:14:54,323
And that's why Senator Wendy Davis

1259
01:14:54,406 --> 01:14:57,034
decided to stand up and fight
for the rights of women.

1260
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:01,955
So this bill went to the Senate.

1261
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:07,336
But, because it was the final day
of the session, the clock was ticking.

1262
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:11,507
And that gave me an opportunity
for the filibuster.

1263
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:14,176
Members, I'm rising on the floor today...

1264
01:15:14,384 --> 01:15:19,973
That meant I had about 13 hours of talking
to make sure that this bill did not pass.

1265
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:24,811
The rules in Texas say
that you cannot have a sip of water,

1266
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:26,313
you cannot have anything to drink,

1267
01:15:26,396 --> 01:15:30,108
you cannot lean on your desk
and you certainly cannot leave the floor

1268
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,527
to go to the restroom.

1269
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:37,950
So I had a pair of running shoes
on my feet and I had a catheter bag.

1270
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:41,203
A doctor had come over
at about six o'clock that morning

1271
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:44,998
and inserted a catheter so that
I'd be able to make it through the day.

1272
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,460
Senator Wendy Davis must make it
to midnight.

1273
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,462
That is the end of the special session.

1274
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:53,590
Essentially she's wasting time,
running out the clock.

1275
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:57,219
The way she's doing that? Right now,
she's reading letters from Texas women

1276
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:59,388
who oppose this legislation.

1277
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:02,558
...in order for their voices to be heard.

1278
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:06,270
- ...told me any pregnancy will be very...
- And the filibuster went viral.

1279
01:16:06,853 --> 01:16:08,522
Not only was she a woman

1280
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:12,234
opposing the bill, but she was one
of the only women in the room.

1281
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:15,112
It was an internet moment. People had left their kids
with their neighbors

1282
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:25,789
and driven hours to Austin to be there.

1283
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:28,542
Students had left their college campuses

1284
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:31,253
and came to Austin
to hear Wendy filibuster.

1285
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:34,339
These are Texans who relied
on the minority...

1286
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:35,799
I'm a Texan.

1287
01:16:35,882 --> 01:16:39,094
Never seen the outpouring of activism
like we saw there.

1288
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:41,722
You literally could not get
in the capitol.

1289
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:44,558
Every annex was full, every room was full.

1290
01:16:45,475 --> 01:16:46,518
It was extraordinary.

1291
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:49,646
...another ruling she made
was if there was a...

1292
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:52,649
And about 15 minutes
before midnight,

1293
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:55,694
procedural rules of order were broken...

1294
01:16:56,403 --> 01:16:57,487
...and the third...

1295
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:00,282
...in order to bring
my filibuster to an end.

1296
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:03,744
And the people who were there
understood

1297
01:17:03,827 --> 01:17:08,332
that rules were being broken
in order to silence opposition to a bill.

1298
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:11,293
After consultation
with the parliamentarian and after...

1299
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:14,588
- And they'd had enough.
- ...well taken and is sustained.

1300
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:15,881
Bullshit!

1301
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:18,175
The chair recognizes Senator...

1302
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:22,429
Let her speak!
Let her speak! Let her speak!

1303
01:17:22,512 --> 01:17:25,057
Let her speak! Let her speak!
Let her speak!

1304
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,897
Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!

1305
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,858
Wendy! Wendy!
Wendy! Wendy!

1306
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:37,444
Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!

1307
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:41,239
And as they began to scream,

1308
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:45,202
everyone up and down the hallways
began to scream,

1309
01:17:45,285 --> 01:17:49,164
and at every level of the rotunda
and outside on the capitol lawn.

1310
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:52,918
And I could literally feel

1311
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:56,296
the vibration of their voices
and their energy

1312
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,923
and the pounding of their feet.

1313
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:01,551
If I can have order.
We are in the middle of a vote.

1314
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:04,429
The secretary has started the vote.

1315
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:07,057
It ate up enough of the clock

1316
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:10,936
that the final vote wasn't taken
until 12:03.

1317
01:18:11,269 --> 01:18:14,856
Members, it's now past midnight. And so...

1318
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:18,193
And it became known
as the people's filibuster. Rightly so.

1319
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:21,530
This is straight from
Senator Wendy Davis, okay?

1320
01:18:21,905 --> 01:18:22,739
Hold your applause.

1321
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:26,201
First, "I love you guys." Okay? -
- We love you, too, Wendy!

1322
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:39,464
"So the lieutenant governor has agreed
that SB-5 is dead."

1323
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:58,191
The woman who filibustered
the Senate the other day,

1324
01:18:59,943 --> 01:19:02,571
she was born into difficult circumstances.

1325
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,740
She's the daughter of a single woman.

1326
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:07,367
She was a teenage mother herself.

1327
01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:12,247
She managed to eventually graduate
from Harvard Law School

1328
01:19:12,622 --> 01:19:14,708
and serve in the Texas Senate.

1329
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:16,918
It's unfortunate

1330
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:20,005
that she hasn't learned
from her own example

1331
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:24,593
that every life must be given a chance
to realize its full potential

1332
01:19:24,676 --> 01:19:26,511
and that every life matters.

1333
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:30,056
We had successfully
killed the bill.

1334
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,768
But we were called right back
within a few days.

1335
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:37,230
And, of course, this time
there was no way to filibuster.

1336
01:19:37,397 --> 01:19:41,318
♪ Where have all the babies gone?♪

1337
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:46,072
♪ I pray to heaven for every one♪

1338
01:19:46,156 --> 01:19:47,824
Get ready to do it all again.

1339
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:50,911
Governor Rick Perry called
a special session early this evening.

1340
01:19:54,247 --> 01:19:56,166
We talked about the choice.

1341
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:59,336
Do you think if the mother had
a conversation with the baby and said,

1342
01:19:59,544 --> 01:20:03,006
"You know, this just isn't really
convenient to give birth to you right now.

1343
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:04,466
Do you mind dying?"

1344
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,051
I can't take it anymore!

1345
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:09,638
-I think--
-That was very offensive!

1346
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,932
I think that baby would say--

1347
01:20:12,682 --> 01:20:14,518
This is an assault on women!

1348
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,522
I don't get mad with those folks.
I pray for her.

1349
01:20:18,605 --> 01:20:19,815
You are failing Texas!

1350
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:22,859
You are failing Texas!

1351
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:33,036
In just a few moments,

1352
01:20:33,578 --> 01:20:35,455
we are going to vote on a bill

1353
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:39,751
that has deeply and profoundly divided us.

1354
01:20:40,794 --> 01:20:42,796
Separating us by political party...

1355
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:45,674
by gender...

1356
01:20:46,299 --> 01:20:47,926
by life experience...

1357
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:51,263
by what our religious beliefs bind us to.

1358
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:53,431
Not in this life!

1359
01:20:53,598 --> 01:20:58,895
We all believe in the beauty
and the wonder that is human life.

1360
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:03,358
But I also believe that women already here

1361
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:05,360
are beautiful.

1362
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:08,154
And that they deserve to live,

1363
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:12,826
they deserve to determine
the direction of their lives,

1364
01:21:13,618 --> 01:21:17,873
they deserve to be recognized
as full people...

1365
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:23,086
fully capable
of making difficult decisions

1366
01:21:23,336 --> 01:21:27,632
with the help of their family,
their doctor and their God.

1367
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:31,136
Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!

1368
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:34,764
Wendy! Wendy!
Wendy! Wendy!

1369
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:39,227
No woman should be judged by someone else,

1370
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:43,607
someone who believes
they would have made a different decision.

1371
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:47,777
No woman should be judged by someone else,

1372
01:21:48,528 --> 01:21:52,699
because these decisions
are never ever easy.

1373
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:56,411
They're not made casually or quickly.

1374
01:21:56,745 --> 01:22:01,750
And those of us in the Senate
should refuse to make this decision

1375
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:04,377
casually or quickly.

1376
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:07,547
Because the fight for the future of Texas

1377
01:22:08,214 --> 01:22:09,382
is just beginning.

1378
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:12,135
Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you, members.

1379
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:18,600
There being 19 ayes and 11 nays,
House Bill 2 is finally passed.

1380
01:22:18,683 --> 01:22:22,812
We won't go back! We won't go back!

1381
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:26,483
We won't go back!
We won't go back!

1382
01:22:26,566 --> 01:22:27,400
Come on!

1383
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,152
We won't go back! We won't go back!

1384
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:37,369
It is our responsibility to improve
the quality of care for women

1385
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:38,328
in the state.

1386
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:42,082
Of course, the argument was made
all along that somehow

1387
01:22:42,332 --> 01:22:44,834
this is being done in the interests
of women's health.

1388
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:50,548
And in spite of incredible scientific
pushback to that statement,

1389
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:52,300
House Bill 2 passed.

1390
01:22:52,842 --> 01:22:55,136
Shame! Shame! Shame!

1391
01:22:55,595 --> 01:22:56,888
Shame! Shame! Shame!

1392
01:23:01,017 --> 01:23:06,022
The law went into effect and over half of
our abortion clinics in the state closed.

1393
01:23:09,734 --> 01:23:12,529
We went from 41 clinics to 19

1394
01:23:12,612 --> 01:23:15,031
as a consequence
of the implementation of the law.

1395
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,243
In central Texas,

1396
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:20,286
there were no clinics left open.

1397
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:23,873
And that was pretty demoralizing.

1398
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:28,169
But there was something really important
that had happened.

1399
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:34,467
We as a state woke up to the reality
of an assault on women.

1400
01:23:35,218 --> 01:23:38,054
We woke up to the reality of our power.

1401
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:42,267
And it's a power that has continued
to grow.

1402
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:50,233
The first major abortion case
in almost a decade.

1403
01:23:50,316 --> 01:23:54,320
It centers on a case in Texas
that has already forced clinics to close

1404
01:23:54,404 --> 01:23:56,656
and could force even more
to close down as well.

1405
01:23:57,741 --> 01:24:01,995
The stakes are huge. And they're not just
huge for Texas women.

1406
01:24:02,495 --> 01:24:04,539
They're huge for women
all over the country.

1407
01:24:04,998 --> 01:24:06,541
Anti-choice! Anti-women!

1408
01:24:06,624 --> 01:24:10,170
If the Court affirms
the law in Texas,

1409
01:24:10,336 --> 01:24:14,340
I have no doubt that other states
will immediately follow suit.

1410
01:24:14,924 --> 01:24:17,677
And so many women will no longer
have access

1411
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:19,471
to abortion care.

1412
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:30,899
It's almost like a perfect
controlled experiment, isn't it?

1413
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:32,984
It's like you put the law into effect,

1414
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:37,113
twelve clinics closed. You take the law
out of the fact, they reopen.

1415
01:24:37,363 --> 01:24:39,074
That's absolutely correct.

1416
01:24:39,157 --> 01:24:42,327
I went to the argument,
and I was struck by

1417
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:47,957
the difference between a Court
with one female justice

1418
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:49,876
and a Court with three.

1419
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,879
Can I walk through the burden?

1420
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:56,758
She has to travel 200 miles
to get two days of treatment.

1421
01:24:57,217 --> 01:25:00,970
How many women
are located over 100 miles...

1422
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:03,890
The women could reinforce
each other's viewpoints.

1423
01:25:03,973 --> 01:25:05,850
There has to some tie between

1424
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:07,477
benefit and burden, doesn't there?

1425
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:09,395
I think they were very good

1426
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:12,690
at throwing aside
all of these specious arguments,

1427
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:15,819
that the state was making that
really all they cared about was women.

1428
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:19,072
There are benefits for the ASC
and admitting-privileges...

1429
01:25:19,155 --> 01:25:21,741
What is the benefit...
What evidence is there...

1430
01:25:21,866 --> 01:25:23,868
Just said, "You know, what's going on here

1431
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:28,039
is you are making it more difficult
for women to exercise their choice...

1432
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:32,085
This is one of the lowest-risk procedures.

1433
01:25:32,168 --> 01:25:34,546
...and we are going to respect
her decision."

1434
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:37,048
...this law was targeted at abortion only.

1435
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:39,676
 ...many procedures
are much higher risk:

1436
01:25:39,759 --> 01:25:42,720
colonoscopies, liposuctions.
We could go on and on.

1437
01:25:43,346 --> 01:25:45,557
And I have to tell you,
they took over that argument.

1438
01:25:48,017 --> 01:25:52,564
What it's about is that
a woman has a fundamental right

1439
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:54,941
to make this choice for herself.

1440
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:59,445
Today the Supreme Court struck down
a Texas law

1441
01:25:59,612 --> 01:26:02,490
that imposed strict requirements
on clinics and doctors,

1442
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:07,078
finding those limits place an undue burden
on the constitutional right to abortion.

1443
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:14,752
For me, the highlight of that decision was

1444
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:18,381
the justices' incorporation
of actual medicine and science.

1445
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:24,888
We've seen a decision about abortion that says,
"If you're going to make a claim,

1446
01:26:27,765 --> 01:26:30,018
the claim must be factually accurate."

1447
01:26:30,101 --> 01:26:31,603
But the reality is

1448
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:35,440
that the appointing of our justices
is highly political.

1449
01:26:39,402 --> 01:26:43,656
And so, at any time, the balance
of the Court can change.

1450
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:46,910
And the decision may be different
next time.

1451
01:26:53,082 --> 01:26:56,252
The Supreme Court decision in Hellerstedt

1452
01:26:56,336 --> 01:27:00,465
motivated pro-life people,
reinforced, once again,

1453
01:27:01,132 --> 01:27:04,677
that if we want to change the laws,
we have to change the Supreme Court.

1454
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:11,059
Donald Trump meeting privately
in New York with leading evangelicals.

1455
01:27:11,267 --> 01:27:14,812
Donald Trump came and had a conversation.
Now we don't agree on everything.

1456
01:27:15,021 --> 01:27:17,941
I've been working on national elections
for a number of years

1457
01:27:18,024 --> 01:27:20,026
and there's always been an effort

1458
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:23,112
to try to consolidate
conservative evangelicals.

1459
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:26,282
It is a critical voting block
for any Republican candidate.

1460
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:31,955
To win in November, Donald Trump needs
75, maybe even 80 percent of evangelicals.

1461
01:27:32,288 --> 01:27:34,082
Our goals are very simple.

1462
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:38,795
It is to advance faith in public policy
and in our culture as a whole,

1463
01:27:38,878 --> 01:27:42,632
from a Christian world view.
We are unapologetically Christian.

1464
01:27:42,715 --> 01:27:46,761
Evangelicals have been under constant
attack by the Obama administration.

1465
01:27:47,011 --> 01:27:48,513
And quite frankly, they're tired of it.

1466
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:53,601
And under Barack Obama,
this heavy hand of government tried

1467
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:58,314
to force society to accept things like
abortion and the redefinition of marriage.

1468
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:00,942
These things run counter to nature.

1469
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:05,530
They run counter to the moral law of God.
And so what you saw is pushback.

1470
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:09,575
Obviously, there's not many choices here.
The choice is between Hillary Clinton,

1471
01:28:09,742 --> 01:28:12,036
and we know exactly
what she will provide to America.

1472
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:13,830
Or we have Donald Trump.

1473
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:17,750
He's considered
the least religious of the candidates.

1474
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:20,837
If Ivanka weren't my daughter,
perhaps I'd be dating her.

1475
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:24,632
You know about
sexual predators and things like that.

1476
01:28:24,757 --> 01:28:27,510
- You are one!
- All right, wasn't gonna say that.

1477
01:28:27,593 --> 01:28:30,680
I'm very pro-choice.
I just believe in choice.

1478
01:28:30,763 --> 01:28:33,224
Evangelical Christians
aren't fully onboard yet.

1479
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:35,643
Some say they may sit home come November.

1480
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:38,271
You cannot ignore
this constituency.

1481
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:41,816
But remember,
George H.W. Bush was pro-choice,

1482
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:43,151
became pro-life.

1483
01:28:43,234 --> 01:28:46,487
Mr. Bush has something to think about.

1484
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:48,823
Human life is precious, born or unborn.

1485
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:53,870
Ronald Reagan signed the most liberal
abortion law in America in the late '60s,

1486
01:28:53,953 --> 01:28:56,706
and was a pro-life hero by 1980.

1487
01:28:56,789 --> 01:28:59,584
I think when you interrupt the pregnancy,
you're taking a human life.

1488
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:03,796
So all Donald Trump has to do is,
as those prior nominees did,

1489
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:05,423
make it clear.

1490
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:09,093
We came together in a national crusade
to make America great again.

1491
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:12,513
-And to make a new beginning.
-Make it clear.

1492
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:14,349
"I changed my views."

1493
01:29:15,933 --> 01:29:20,188
The justices that I'm going to appoint
will be pro-life.

1494
01:29:21,105 --> 01:29:25,109
The pro-life constituency is absolutely
essential for a Republican victory.

1495
01:29:25,234 --> 01:29:26,694
Donald J. Trump.

1496
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:31,991
Make it clear that if he becomes
president, he'll fight for those things.

1497
01:29:32,658 --> 01:29:34,827
It's not only about Roe v Wade.

1498
01:29:34,911 --> 01:29:37,872
It is about what's happening right now
in America.

1499
01:29:38,247 --> 01:29:40,875
So many states are putting

1500
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:44,962
very stringent regulations on women that

1501
01:29:45,296 --> 01:29:47,965
block them from exercising
that choice...

1502
01:29:48,549 --> 01:29:52,345
I believe what sold the pro-life
community on Donald Trump

1503
01:29:52,428 --> 01:29:55,098
was the final debate in Las Vegas.

1504
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:59,977
I will defend Roe v. Wade,
and I will defend women's rights to make

1505
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:02,105
their own health care decisions.

1506
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:04,774
I was in the audience.
I was watching him. ...which divides you--
a woman's right to abortion?

1507
01:30:07,610 --> 01:30:11,531
And when he went into a discussion

1508
01:30:11,614 --> 01:30:13,658
of partial-birth abortion,
late-term abortion...

1509
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:18,913
If you go with what Hillary is saying,
in the ninth month, you can take the baby

1510
01:30:18,996 --> 01:30:22,291
and rip the baby out of the womb
of the mother. ...I knew those were Donald Trump's words.

1511
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:29,090
Now, you can say that that's okay.

1512
01:30:29,215 --> 01:30:31,801
Those were not the words
of some speechwriter.

1513
01:30:31,884 --> 01:30:33,052
It's not okay with me.

1514
01:30:33,553 --> 01:30:35,847
Because based on what she's saying...

1515
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:38,433
It was clearly Trump speaking
at that moment.

1516
01:30:38,558 --> 01:30:43,062
You can take the baby and rip the baby
out of the womb, in the ninth month,

1517
01:30:43,646 --> 01:30:46,649
on the final day!
And that's not acceptable.

1518
01:30:46,732 --> 01:30:48,151
And when he did that,

1519
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:52,613
I believe he sealed the deal
with pro-lifers across the country.

1520
01:30:55,158 --> 01:30:57,368
And will,
to the best of my ability,

1521
01:30:57,702 --> 01:31:00,037
...preserve, protect, and defend...

1522
01:31:00,204 --> 01:31:02,123
...preserve, protect,
and defend...

1523
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:04,417
...the Constitution of the United States.

1524
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:06,794
...the Constitution of the United States.

1525
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:08,921
-So help me God.
-So help me God.

1526
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:11,382
Congratulations, Mr. President.

1527
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:43,623
When I became a physician,

1528
01:31:43,706 --> 01:31:47,043
the oath that I took was that I was gonna
provide the best medical care

1529
01:31:47,543 --> 01:31:49,086
for all patients who needed it.

1530
01:31:55,092 --> 01:31:57,428
And patients need access to abortions.

1531
01:31:59,138 --> 01:32:02,308
And they need care delivered to them
with dignity and respect.

1532
01:32:08,689 --> 01:32:09,774
All right, you ready?

1533
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:14,695
So if that means getting on planes
or driving hundreds of miles,

1534
01:32:15,321 --> 01:32:18,491
I'm going to continue to do that,
because that's what's needed right now.

1535
01:32:22,745 --> 01:32:24,622
Women have built their lives

1536
01:32:24,705 --> 01:32:28,125
around the ability to make decisions
about pregnancy.

1537
01:32:31,462 --> 01:32:35,591
So, we have to make sure
that their right is protected.

1538
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:40,221
And we have to remain vigilant.

1539
01:32:40,429 --> 01:32:44,475
Because there is a very real concern
that the Trump administration is going

1540
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,185
to appoint anti-abortion judges.

1541
01:32:46,519 --> 01:32:49,438
President Trump announced
nearly a dozen new nominees

1542
01:32:49,522 --> 01:32:51,232
for the lower federal courts.

1543
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:54,569
Hundreds of seats are going
to be filled by this administration

1544
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:56,028
thoughout the judicial system.

1545
01:32:56,112 --> 01:32:59,365
These people will be serving
for the rest of their lives.

1546
01:32:59,448 --> 01:33:02,326
It's life term. It's generations
of impact on American law.

1547
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,912
The Court of Appeals,
circuit judges...

1548
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:06,664
whether it be district judges...

1549
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:09,625
When you really think about
the way we're going,

1550
01:33:09,792 --> 01:33:12,670
years from now, picking good judges
even at the district level

1551
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:16,591
is extremely important.
And that's how we're going to finish this

1552
01:33:16,757 --> 01:33:18,175
to overtun Roe vs. Wade.

1553
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:21,012
Today I am keeping
another promise,

1554
01:33:21,929 --> 01:33:25,266
by nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch

1555
01:33:25,349 --> 01:33:28,019
to the United States Supreme Court.

1556
01:33:28,102 --> 01:33:31,147
We're putting out strong
pro-life bills and so, eventually,

1557
01:33:31,230 --> 01:33:33,858
the Supreme Court will weigh in
on the issue.

1558
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:37,361
I don't know
how long it will take

1559
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:40,281
to overturn Roe v. Wade,
or when it will be overturned.

1560
01:33:40,823 --> 01:33:42,617
I have no doubt it will be.

1561
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:46,954
All across the nation,

1562
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:50,833
life is winning again in America.

1563
01:33:55,087 --> 01:33:57,381
In a monumental moment
for the Supreme Court,

1564
01:33:57,465 --> 01:34:00,134
Justice Anthony Kennedy is retiring
from the Court.

1565
01:34:00,217 --> 01:34:02,595
The crucial swing vote
is now stepping down

1566
01:34:02,678 --> 01:34:06,182
and President Trump will get the chance
to shape this Court for a generation.

1567
01:34:06,682 --> 01:34:10,102
This is an opportunity to restore
a culture of life in this country.

1568
01:34:10,186 --> 01:34:12,355
This is a historic moment.

1569
01:34:12,688 --> 01:34:14,774
And we have a chance
to take down Roe v. Wade.

1570
01:34:15,358 --> 01:34:17,860
I think this supercharges
the president's base.

1571
01:34:17,943 --> 01:34:20,321
Seven out of ten of his evangelical voters

1572
01:34:20,404 --> 01:34:23,032
said that the Supreme Court has
an effect on their daily lives.

1573
01:34:23,115 --> 01:34:26,702
And I think he should put forth
a candidate that is above reproach

1574
01:34:26,786 --> 01:34:28,996
on this issue of the sanctity
of human life.

1575
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:30,956
And I think Roe can be overturned.

1576
01:34:31,874 --> 01:34:35,044
I do believe it could be overturned
and I think it goes back to the states.

1577
01:34:35,127 --> 01:34:38,964
And I think that the states will decide
what policies to handle. And I think...

1578
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:42,301
we will be
a predominantly pro-life nation.

1579
01:34:43,094 --> 01:34:45,638
You're gonna see 20 states

1580
01:34:46,555 --> 01:34:49,225
pass laws banning abortion outright.

1581
01:34:49,308 --> 01:34:50,601
Because they know

1582
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:53,604
that there are now going to be
five votes on the Supreme Court

1583
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:55,272
to overturn Roe v. Wade.

1584
01:34:55,731 --> 01:34:58,359
If Roe v. Wade is overturned
by the Supreme Court,

1585
01:34:58,442 --> 01:35:01,112
we will see some states that will say
abortion is not allowed,

1586
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:03,948
there will be some states
that are going to...

1587
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:07,493
probably not place many limits
on abortion at all,

1588
01:35:08,202 --> 01:35:11,330
but we are not going to stop.
We will keep working

1589
01:35:11,789 --> 01:35:13,541
to protect the unborn babies.

1590
01:35:22,091 --> 01:35:25,803
Whether or not Roe
is overturned, the rights granted by Roe

1591
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:28,389
are almost gone for many women already.

1592
01:35:30,057 --> 01:35:32,560
So, if doctors can't perform
the procedure,

1593
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:35,771
or clinics can't keep their doors open...
