1
00:00:15,461 --> 00:00:20,797


2
00:00:43,848 --> 00:00:45,907
Hi, honey.

3
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,645
Hi, Mom.

4
00:00:49,754 --> 00:00:51,984
You feeling any better?

5
00:00:52,022 --> 00:00:54,081
A little bit.

6
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:56,093
Guess what.

7
00:00:56,127 --> 00:00:57,253
What?

8
00:00:57,294 --> 00:00:59,125
Grandfather's here.

9
00:00:59,163 --> 00:01:02,189
Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?

10
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:05,396
You're sick. That's why he's here.

11
00:01:05,436 --> 00:01:07,199
He'll pinch my cheek.

12
00:01:07,238 --> 00:01:08,830
I hate that.

13
00:01:08,873 --> 00:01:10,602
Maybe he won't.

14
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:14,133
How's the sickie?

15
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:20,107
I'll leave you two pals alone.

16
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:23,450
I brought you a special present.

17
00:01:23,487 --> 00:01:25,352
- What is it? - Open it up.

18
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:32,888
- A book? - That's right.

19
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,093
When I was your age, television was called books.

20
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:38,397
This is a special book.

21
00:01:38,435 --> 00:01:41,734
It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick...

22
00:01:41,772 --> 00:01:44,138
and I used to read it to your father.

23
00:01:44,175 --> 00:01:46,735
Today I'm going to read it to you.

24
00:01:46,777 --> 00:01:48,870
Does it got any sports in it?

25
00:01:48,913 --> 00:01:50,312
Are you kidding?

26
00:01:50,347 --> 00:01:54,283
Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge...

27
00:01:54,318 --> 00:01:56,809
giants, monsters, chases...

28
00:01:56,854 --> 00:02:00,813
escapes, true love, miracles.

29
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:02,792
That doesn't sound too bad.

30
00:02:02,827 --> 00:02:05,261
I'll try and stay awake.

31
00:02:05,296 --> 00:02:08,697
Thank you very much. That's very nice of you.

32
00:02:08,732 --> 00:02:11,360
Your vote of confidence is overwhelming.

33
00:02:11,402 --> 00:02:13,370
All right.

34
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,032
''The Princess Bride...

35
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:20,043
''by S. Morgenstern.

36
00:02:20,077 --> 00:02:22,045
''Chapter One.

37
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:25,048
''Buttercup was raised on a small farm...

38
00:02:25,082 --> 00:02:27,050
''in the country of Florin.

39
00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:30,053
''Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse...

40
00:02:30,087 --> 00:02:33,056
''and tormenting the farm boy that worked there.

41
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,049
''His name was Westley, but she never called him that.''

42
00:02:37,094 --> 00:02:39,153
Isn't that a wonderful beginning?

43
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,529
Yeah, it's really good.

44
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:45,729
''Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure...

45
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:47,737
as ordering Westley around.''

46
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:50,433
Farm boy, polish my horse's saddle.

47
00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:53,409
I want to see my face shining in it by morning.

48
00:02:53,444 --> 00:02:55,275
As you wish.

49
00:02:58,515 --> 00:03:01,712
''As you wish'' was all he ever said to her.

50
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:06,988
Farm boy, fill these with water.

51
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:10,517
Please.

52
00:03:10,561 --> 00:03:12,961
As you wish.

53
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:18,368
That day she was amazed to discover...

54
00:03:18,402 --> 00:03:21,303
that when he was saying, ''As you wish''...

55
00:03:21,338 --> 00:03:23,499
what he meant was, ''I love you.''

56
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:28,736
Even more amazing was the day she realized...

57
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:31,145
she truly loved him back.

58
00:03:32,616 --> 00:03:33,810
Farm boy.

59
00:03:39,623 --> 00:03:42,091
Fetch me that pitcher.

60
00:03:56,507 --> 00:03:59,169
As you wish.

61
00:04:08,752 --> 00:04:10,549
Hold it, hold it.

62
00:04:10,587 --> 00:04:13,488
What is this? Are you trying to trick me?

63
00:04:13,524 --> 00:04:15,492
And where's the sports?

64
00:04:15,526 --> 00:04:18,359
Is this a kissing book?

65
00:04:18,395 --> 00:04:20,158
Wait. Just wait.

66
00:04:20,197 --> 00:04:22,358
When does it get good?

67
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,368
Keep your shirt on and let me read.

68
00:04:25,402 --> 00:04:27,802
''Westley had no money for marriage...

69
00:04:27,838 --> 00:04:30,329
''so he packed his few belongings and left the farm...

70
00:04:30,374 --> 00:04:32,239
''to seek his fortune across the sea.''

71
00:04:32,276 --> 00:04:36,144
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup.

72
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,375
I don't believe this!

73
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:41,475
I fear I'll never see you again.

74
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:43,577
Of course you will.

75
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,851
What if something happens to you?

76
00:04:49,994 --> 00:04:52,656
Hear this now...

77
00:04:52,696 --> 00:04:55,392
I will always come for you.

78
00:04:55,432 --> 00:04:58,959
But how can you be sure?

79
00:04:59,003 --> 00:05:00,903
This is true love.

80
00:05:03,207 --> 00:05:05,437
Do you think this happens every day?

81
00:05:17,154 --> 00:05:19,384
Westley didn't reach his destination.

82
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:22,722
His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts...

83
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,160
who never left captives alive.

84
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:28,164
When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered...

85
00:05:28,198 --> 00:05:30,132
Murdered by pirates is good!

86
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:32,158
She went into her room and shut the door...

87
00:05:32,202 --> 00:05:35,433
and for days she neither slept nor ate.

88
00:05:35,472 --> 00:05:38,202
I will never love again.

89
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,172
Five years later, the main square of Florin City...

90
00:05:47,217 --> 00:05:50,345
was filled as never before to hear the announcement...

91
00:05:50,387 --> 00:05:53,049
of the great Prince Humperdinck's bride-to-be.

92
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:04,364
My people...

93
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:06,631
a month from now...

94
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,606
our country will have its 500th anniversary.

95
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:14,771
On that sundown, I shall marry a lady...

96
00:06:14,812 --> 00:06:18,373
who was once a commoner like yourselves...

97
00:06:18,415 --> 00:06:24,217
but perhaps you will not find her common now.

98
00:06:24,254 --> 00:06:26,188
Would you like to meet her?

99
00:06:27,991 --> 00:06:34,260
My people, the princess Buttercup!

100
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:57,410
Buttercup's emptiness consumed her.

101
00:06:57,454 --> 00:07:00,014
Although the law of the land gave Humperdinck...

102
00:07:00,057 --> 00:07:02,321
the right to choose his bride...

103
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:05,192
she did not love him.

104
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:11,362
Despite Humperdinck's reassurance: : :

105
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:13,699
That she would grow to love him...

106
00:07:13,737 --> 00:07:17,298
the only joy she found was in her daily ride.

107
00:07:29,286 --> 00:07:31,254
A word, my lady?

108
00:07:31,288 --> 00:07:36,225
We are but poor, lost circus performers.

109
00:07:36,293 --> 00:07:38,818
Is there a village nearby?

110
00:07:38,896 --> 00:07:42,093
There is nothing nearby, not for miles.

111
00:07:42,132 --> 00:07:45,693
Then there will be no one to hear you scream.

112
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:54,234
What is that you're ripping?

113
00:07:54,311 --> 00:07:57,576
It's fabric from the uniform of an army officer of Guilder.

114
00:07:57,614 --> 00:07:59,377
Who's Guilder?

115
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:02,943
The country across the sea, the sworn enemy of Florin.

116
00:08:02,986 --> 00:08:04,180
Go!

117
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:06,689
Once the horse reaches the castle...

118
00:08:06,757 --> 00:08:08,486
the fabric will make the prince suspect...

119
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:10,925
that the Guilderians have abducted his love.

120
00:08:10,961 --> 00:08:13,691
When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier...

121
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,290
his suspicions will be totally confirmed.

122
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,824
You never said anything about killing anyone.

123
00:08:18,902 --> 00:08:21,496
I've hired you to help me start a war.

124
00:08:21,572 --> 00:08:23,335
It's a prestigious line of work...

125
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:26,240
with a long and glorious tradition.

126
00:08:26,276 --> 00:08:29,643
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.

127
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,811
Am I going mad, or did the word ''think'' escape your lips?

128
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:37,115
You were not hired for your brains...

129
00:08:37,154 --> 00:08:38,781
you hippopotamic land mass!

130
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:40,312
I agree with Fezzik.

131
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,790
The sot has spoken!

132
00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:45,659
What happens to her is not truly your concern!

133
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:47,163
I will kill her!

134
00:08:47,197 --> 00:08:49,222
And remember this, never forget this...

135
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:51,928
When I found you, you were so slobbering drunk...

136
00:08:52,002 --> 00:08:54,266
you couldn't buy brandy!

137
00:08:54,304 --> 00:08:58,240
And you... friendless, brainless...

138
00:08:58,275 --> 00:09:00,266
helpless, hopeless!

139
00:09:00,344 --> 00:09:03,711
Do you want me to send you back to where you were...

140
00:09:03,747 --> 00:09:06,978
unemployed in Greenland?

141
00:09:19,763 --> 00:09:24,564
That Vizzini, he can... fuss.

142
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:26,068
Fuss, fuss...

143
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:30,039
I think he like to scream... at us.

144
00:09:30,107 --> 00:09:34,737
Probably he means no... harm.

145
00:09:34,778 --> 00:09:38,145
He's really very short on... charm.

146
00:09:38,181 --> 00:09:41,082
You have a great gift for rhyme.

147
00:09:41,118 --> 00:09:43,086
Yes, yes, some of the time.

148
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,281
Enough of that!

149
00:09:45,322 --> 00:09:47,085
Fezzik, are there rocks ahead?

150
00:09:47,124 --> 00:09:50,093
If there are, we'll all be dead.

151
00:09:50,127 --> 00:09:53,096
No more rhymes, now. I mean it!

152
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,121
Anybody want a peanut?

153
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:06,332
We'll reach the cliffs by dawn.

154
00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:09,738
Why are you doing that?

155
00:10:09,813 --> 00:10:12,338
Making sure nobody's following us.

156
00:10:12,382 --> 00:10:14,282
That would be inconceivable.

157
00:10:14,318 --> 00:10:16,343
Despite what you think...

158
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,048
you will be caught, and when you are...

159
00:10:19,122 --> 00:10:21,454
the prince will see you all hanged.

160
00:10:21,491 --> 00:10:24,153
Of all the necks on this boat, Highness...

161
00:10:24,194 --> 00:10:26,958
the one you should be worrying about is your own.

162
00:10:31,835 --> 00:10:33,132
Stop doing that!

163
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,502
We can all relax. It's almost over.

164
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:37,234
You are sure nobody's following us?

165
00:10:37,307 --> 00:10:40,367
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally...

166
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,776
and in all other ways inconceivable!

167
00:10:42,813 --> 00:10:44,781
No one in Guilder knows what we've done...

168
00:10:44,815 --> 00:10:48,376
and no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast.

169
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:52,855
Out of curiosity, why do you ask?

170
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:57,155
I happened to look behind us, and something is there.

171
00:10:57,194 --> 00:10:58,718
What?

172
00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:07,628
Probably some local fisherman...

173
00:11:07,671 --> 00:11:10,231
out for a pleasure cruise at night...

174
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:12,605
through eel-infested waters.

175
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,534
What?

176
00:11:15,612 --> 00:11:17,079
Go in! Get after her!

177
00:11:17,114 --> 00:11:18,809
I don't swim.

178
00:11:18,849 --> 00:11:20,612
I only dog-paddle.

179
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:24,687
Veer left!

180
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,351
Left!

181
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,136
Do you know what that sound is, Highness?

182
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,764
Those are the shrieking eels.

183
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,364
If you don't believe me, just wait.

184
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:47,741
They always grow louder...

185
00:11:47,778 --> 00:11:51,111
when they're about to feed on human flesh.

186
00:11:52,716 --> 00:11:54,707
If you swim back now...

187
00:11:54,818 --> 00:11:57,810
I promise no harm will come to you.

188
00:11:57,854 --> 00:12:02,188
I doubt you'll get such an offer from the eels.

189
00:12:11,168 --> 00:12:14,331
She doesn't get eaten by the eels at this time.

190
00:12:14,371 --> 00:12:15,702
What?

191
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:17,707
The eel doesn't get her.

192
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:20,608
I'm explaining to you because you look nervous.

193
00:12:20,644 --> 00:12:23,477
I wasn't nervous.

194
00:12:24,781 --> 00:12:27,750
Maybe I was a little bit concerned...

195
00:12:27,784 --> 00:12:29,342
but that's not the same thing.

196
00:12:29,386 --> 00:12:31,752
Because we can stop now if you want.

197
00:12:31,788 --> 00:12:35,588
No. You could read a little bit more, if you want.

198
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:40,028
''Do you know what that sound is, Highness?

199
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,395
''Those are the shrieking eels.''

200
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:44,900
Pass that, Grandpa. You read it already.

201
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:47,802
My goodness, I did.

202
00:12:47,838 --> 00:12:50,363
I'm sorry. Beg your pardon.

203
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,067
All right, all right. Let's see.

204
00:12:52,108 --> 00:12:55,009
She was in the water, the eel was coming after her...

205
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:56,342
she was frightened...

206
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:58,540
the eel started to charge her, and then...

207
00:13:01,218 --> 00:13:03,686
Put her down. Just put her down!

208
00:13:08,425 --> 00:13:09,915
I think he's getting closer.

209
00:13:09,993 --> 00:13:11,984
He's no concern of ours.

210
00:13:12,062 --> 00:13:13,620
Sail on!

211
00:13:13,697 --> 00:13:16,029
I suppose you think you're brave, don't you?

212
00:13:16,066 --> 00:13:18,626
Only compared to some.

213
00:13:24,274 --> 00:13:27,175
Look! He's right on top of us!

214
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,008
I wonder if he's using the same wind we are using.

215
00:13:30,046 --> 00:13:33,607
Whoever he is, he's too late. See?

216
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:38,185
The Cliffs of Insanity!

217
00:13:38,221 --> 00:13:40,246
Hurry up!

218
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,155
Move the thing!

219
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:44,922
And that other thing!

220
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:47,361
Move it!

221
00:13:51,635 --> 00:13:52,932
We're safe.

222
00:13:52,969 --> 00:13:55,563
Only Fezzik is strong enough to go up our way.

223
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:59,507
He'll have to sail for hours till he finds a harbor.

224
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,082
He's climbing the rope, and he's gaining on us!

225
00:14:48,124 --> 00:14:49,751
Inconceivable!

226
00:14:51,895 --> 00:14:53,226
Faster!

227
00:14:53,263 --> 00:14:55,390
I thought I was going faster.

228
00:14:55,432 --> 00:14:57,696
You were supposed to be this colossus...

229
00:14:57,734 --> 00:14:59,599
you were this great legendary thing...

230
00:14:59,636 --> 00:15:01,297
and yet he gains!

231
00:15:01,338 --> 00:15:04,603
I'm carrying three people, and he got only himself.

232
00:15:04,641 --> 00:15:08,805
I do not accept excuses. I have to find a new giant.

233
00:15:08,845 --> 00:15:11,473
Don't say that, Vizzini, please.

234
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,784
Did I make it clear that your job is at stake?

235
00:16:21,384 --> 00:16:23,682
He's got very good arms.

236
00:16:25,522 --> 00:16:27,490
He didn't fall?

237
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:28,991
Inconceivable!

238
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:30,993
You keep using that word.

239
00:16:31,027 --> 00:16:34,963
I do not think it means what you think it means.

240
00:16:34,998 --> 00:16:38,365
My God, he's climbing.

241
00:16:38,401 --> 00:16:41,029
Whoever he is, he's obviously seen us with the princess...

242
00:16:41,071 --> 00:16:42,368
and must therefore die.

243
00:16:42,405 --> 00:16:43,838
You carry her.

244
00:16:43,873 --> 00:16:45,568
We'll head straight for the Guilder frontier.

245
00:16:45,608 --> 00:16:47,007
Catch up when he's dead.

246
00:16:47,043 --> 00:16:49,534
If he falls, fine. If not, the sword.

247
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:51,979
I'm going to duel him left-handed.

248
00:16:52,015 --> 00:16:54,279
You know what a hurry we're in.

249
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:56,217
It's the only way I can be satisfied.

250
00:16:56,252 --> 00:16:59,153
If I use my right, tsk! Over too quickly.

251
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:00,952
Have it your way!

252
00:17:08,198 --> 00:17:09,426
You be careful.

253
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:11,525
People in masks cannot be trusted.

254
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:14,830
I'm waiting!

255
00:17:26,282 --> 00:17:28,978
Hello there!

256
00:17:32,555 --> 00:17:34,216
Slow going?

257
00:17:34,257 --> 00:17:38,159
I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks.

258
00:17:38,194 --> 00:17:41,129
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.

259
00:17:41,164 --> 00:17:42,597
- Sorry. - Thank you.

260
00:17:52,742 --> 00:17:54,903
I do not suppose you could speed things up?

261
00:17:54,944 --> 00:17:56,502
If you're in such a hurry...

262
00:17:56,546 --> 00:17:58,844
you could lower a rope or a tree branch...

263
00:17:58,882 --> 00:18:01,077
or find something useful to do.

264
00:18:01,117 --> 00:18:05,451
I could do that. I got some rope up here...

265
00:18:05,488 --> 00:18:07,649
but I do not think you would accept my help...

266
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,851
since I am only waiting around to kill you.

267
00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:13,090
That does put a damper on our relationship.

268
00:18:13,129 --> 00:18:17,657
But I promise I won't kill you until you reach the top.

269
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,761
That's very comforting, but I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.

270
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:23,670
I hate waiting.

271
00:18:23,706 --> 00:18:26,698
I could give you my word as a Spaniard.

272
00:18:26,743 --> 00:18:28,267
No good.

273
00:18:28,311 --> 00:18:30,279
I've known too many Spaniards.

274
00:18:30,313 --> 00:18:32,474
Any way you'll trust me?

275
00:18:32,515 --> 00:18:34,608
Nothing comes to mind.

276
00:18:34,651 --> 00:18:39,179
I swear on the soul of my father, Domingo Montoya...

277
00:18:39,222 --> 00:18:41,315
you will reach the top alive.

278
00:18:41,357 --> 00:18:43,518
Throw me the rope.

279
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:15,119
Thank you.

280
00:19:15,158 --> 00:19:18,616
Wait. We'll wait until you're ready.

281
00:19:18,661 --> 00:19:20,652
Again, thank you.

282
00:19:33,443 --> 00:19:37,311
I do not mean to pry, but you don't by any chance...

283
00:19:37,347 --> 00:19:39,975
happen to have six fingers on your right hand?

284
00:19:41,784 --> 00:19:43,809
Do you always begin conversations this way?

285
00:19:43,853 --> 00:19:47,414
My father was slaughtered by a six-fingered man.

286
00:19:53,296 --> 00:19:55,764
He was a great swordmaker, my father.

287
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:58,266
When the six-fingered man appeared...

288
00:19:58,301 --> 00:20:00,269
and request a special sword...

289
00:20:00,303 --> 00:20:02,271
my father took the job.

290
00:20:02,305 --> 00:20:05,866
He slaved a year before he was done.

291
00:20:14,951 --> 00:20:17,647
I've never seen its equal.

292
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:21,783
The six-fingered man returned and demanded it...

293
00:20:21,824 --> 00:20:24,292
but at 1/10 his promised price.

294
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:26,295
My father refused.

295
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:28,320
Without a word...

296
00:20:28,364 --> 00:20:32,300
the six-fingered man slashed him through the heart.

297
00:20:32,335 --> 00:20:34,326
I loved my father.

298
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,999
So naturally, I challenged his murderer to a duel.

299
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,771
I failed.

300
00:20:42,011 --> 00:20:44,980
The six-fingered man leave me alive...

301
00:20:45,014 --> 00:20:47,778
but he gave me this.

302
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:51,851
How old were you?

303
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:54,254
I was eleven years old.

304
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,258
When I was strong enough...

305
00:20:56,292 --> 00:21:00,194
I dedicated my life to the study of fencing.

306
00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:05,189
So the next time we meet, I will not fail.

307
00:21:05,234 --> 00:21:10,501
I will go up to the six-fingered man and say...

308
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,235
''Hello.

309
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:15,244
''My name is Inigo Montoya.

310
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:18,247
''You killed my father.

311
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:20,476
''Prepare to die.''

312
00:21:20,516 --> 00:21:23,952
You've done nothing but study swordplay?

313
00:21:23,987 --> 00:21:27,150
More pursuit than study lately.

314
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,385
You see, I cannot find him.

315
00:21:29,425 --> 00:21:32,792
It's been twenty years now. I'm starting to lose confidence.

316
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:35,161
I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills.

317
00:21:35,198 --> 00:21:37,462
There's not a lot of money in revenge.

318
00:21:39,302 --> 00:21:42,430
I certainly hope you find him someday.

319
00:21:42,523 --> 00:21:43,547
You're ready, then?

320
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:45,504
Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair.

321
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,942
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.

322
00:21:48,978 --> 00:21:51,879
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.

323
00:21:53,182 --> 00:21:55,343
Begin.

324
00:22:26,983 --> 00:22:29,281
You are using Bonetti's defense against me?

325
00:22:29,318 --> 00:22:31,946
I thought it fitting considering the rocky terrain.

326
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:34,615
Naturally. You must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.

327
00:22:34,657 --> 00:22:38,320
Naturally, but I find that Thibault cancels out Capo Ferro.

328
00:22:38,361 --> 00:22:40,921
Don't you?

329
00:22:40,963 --> 00:22:42,897
Unless the enemy has studied Agrippa.

330
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:46,826
Which I have.

331
00:22:50,673 --> 00:22:52,766
You are wonderful!

332
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:54,800
Thank you. I've worked hard to become so.

333
00:22:54,844 --> 00:22:56,869
I admit it. You are better than I am.

334
00:22:56,913 --> 00:22:58,380
Then why are you smiling?

335
00:22:58,414 --> 00:23:00,279
Because I know something you don't know.

336
00:23:00,316 --> 00:23:01,578
What is that?

337
00:23:01,617 --> 00:23:03,608
I am not left-handed.

338
00:23:13,629 --> 00:23:15,096
You're amazing.

339
00:23:15,131 --> 00:23:18,259
I ought to be, after twenty years.

340
00:23:18,301 --> 00:23:20,428
There's something I ought to tell you.

341
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,732
Tell me.

342
00:23:21,771 --> 00:23:24,137
I'm not left-handed, either.

343
00:23:49,966 --> 00:23:52,230
Who are you?

344
00:23:52,268 --> 00:23:53,860
No one of consequence.

345
00:23:53,903 --> 00:23:55,427
I must know.

346
00:23:55,471 --> 00:23:57,234
Get used to disappointment.

347
00:24:41,284 --> 00:24:43,343
Kill me quickly.

348
00:24:43,386 --> 00:24:45,217
I would sooner destroy a stained-glass window...

349
00:24:45,254 --> 00:24:46,653
as an artist like yourself.

350
00:24:46,689 --> 00:24:50,181
However, since I can't have you following me, either.

351
00:24:53,196 --> 00:24:57,257
Please understand, I hold you in the highest respect.

352
00:25:08,477 --> 00:25:10,035
Inconceivable!

353
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:12,547
Give her to me! Catch up with us quickly!

354
00:25:12,582 --> 00:25:13,708
What do I do?

355
00:25:13,749 --> 00:25:15,740
Finish him, finish him... your way!

356
00:25:15,785 --> 00:25:18,913
Good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.

357
00:25:18,955 --> 00:25:21,549
Which way's my way?

358
00:25:21,591 --> 00:25:24,526
Pick up one of those rocks, get behind the boulder.

359
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,788
In a few minutes...

360
00:25:25,828 --> 00:25:28,262
the man in black will come running around the bend.

361
00:25:28,297 --> 00:25:32,597
The minute his head is in view, hit it with the rock!

362
00:25:33,803 --> 00:25:36,636
My way is not very sportsmanlike.

363
00:26:05,268 --> 00:26:07,236
I did that on purpose.

364
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,329
I didn't have to miss.

365
00:26:09,372 --> 00:26:11,237
I believe you.

366
00:26:11,274 --> 00:26:13,936
So what happens now?

367
00:26:13,976 --> 00:26:16,911
We face each other as God intended.

368
00:26:16,946 --> 00:26:18,413
Sportsmanlike.

369
00:26:18,447 --> 00:26:22,110
No tricks, no weapons. Skill against skill alone.

370
00:26:22,151 --> 00:26:25,848
You'll put down your rock, and I'll put down my sword...

371
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:28,254
and we'll try and kill each other like civilized people?

372
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:30,693
I could kill you now.

373
00:26:30,693 --> 00:26:32,684
Frankly, I think the odds...

374
00:26:32,728 --> 00:26:36,220
are slightly in your favor at hand-fighting.

375
00:26:36,265 --> 00:26:39,598
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest.

376
00:26:39,635 --> 00:26:41,569
I don't even exercise.

377
00:27:00,923 --> 00:27:03,915
Are you just fiddling around with me, or what?

378
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:06,826
I want you to feel you are doing well.

379
00:27:06,862 --> 00:27:08,523
I hate for people to die embarrassed.

380
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,167
You're quick!

381
00:27:12,201 --> 00:27:13,600
Good thing, too!

382
00:27:13,636 --> 00:27:14,830
Why are you wearing a mask?

383
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,804
Were you burned with acid or something like that?

384
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,932
No. It's just they're terribly comfortable.

385
00:27:18,974 --> 00:27:21,340
I think everyone will be wearing them in the future.

386
00:27:25,147 --> 00:27:30,449
I just figured why you give me so much trouble.

387
00:27:30,486 --> 00:27:34,081
Why is that, do you think?

388
00:27:34,123 --> 00:27:39,186
I haven't fought just one person for so long.

389
00:27:39,228 --> 00:27:42,425
I've been specializing in groups.

390
00:27:42,465 --> 00:27:44,592
Battling gangs for local charities...

391
00:27:44,633 --> 00:27:45,964
that kind of thing.

392
00:27:47,903 --> 00:27:50,895
Why should that make such a... Oof! Difference?

393
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,067
Well, you see...

394
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:54,804
you use different moves...

395
00:27:54,844 --> 00:27:59,247
when you're fighting half a dozen people...

396
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:01,306
than when you only...

397
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:05,719
have to be worried about one.

398
00:28:18,067 --> 00:28:21,195
I do not envy you the headache you will have when you awake.

399
00:28:21,237 --> 00:28:25,901
But in the meantime, rest well and dream of large women.

400
00:28:42,825 --> 00:28:45,020
There was...

401
00:28:45,094 --> 00:28:47,562
a mighty duel.

402
00:28:49,331 --> 00:28:52,027
It ranged all over.

403
00:28:52,101 --> 00:28:54,126
They were both masters.

404
00:28:54,203 --> 00:28:56,603
Who won? How did it end?

405
00:28:56,639 --> 00:29:00,097
The loser ran off alone...

406
00:29:00,142 --> 00:29:07,071
while the winner... followed those footprints toward Guilder.

407
00:29:07,116 --> 00:29:09,175
Shall we track them both?

408
00:29:09,251 --> 00:29:11,583
The loser is nothing.

409
00:29:11,654 --> 00:29:14,089
Only the princess matters.

410
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:17,092
Clearly, this was all planned by warriors of Guilder.

411
00:29:17,092 --> 00:29:20,550
We must all be ready for whatever lies ahead.

412
00:29:20,596 --> 00:29:21,897
Could this be a trap?

413
00:29:21,897 --> 00:29:24,800
I always think everything could be a trap.

414
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,859
That is why I'm still alive.

415
00:29:37,112 --> 00:29:42,311
So, it is down to you, and it is down to me.

416
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,981
If you wish her dead...

417
00:29:46,021 --> 00:29:48,319
by all means, keep moving forward.

418
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,125
Let me explain.

419
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:52,127
There's nothing to explain.

420
00:29:52,127 --> 00:29:54,925
You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen.

421
00:29:54,997 --> 00:29:57,833
Perhaps... an arrangement can be reached.

422
00:29:57,833 --> 00:30:01,701
There will be no arrangement, and you're killing her.

423
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,898
If there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.

424
00:30:07,943 --> 00:30:09,103
I'm afraid so.

425
00:30:09,144 --> 00:30:11,647
I can't compete with you physically...

426
00:30:11,647 --> 00:30:14,450
and you're no match for my brains.

427
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,576
You're that smart?

428
00:30:15,651 --> 00:30:17,118
Let me put it this way...

429
00:30:17,152 --> 00:30:20,356
have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?

430
00:30:20,356 --> 00:30:22,051
- Yes. - Morons.

431
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:23,216
Really?

432
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:27,062
In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.

433
00:30:27,062 --> 00:30:29,530
For the princess?

434
00:30:29,598 --> 00:30:31,998
To the death?

435
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:33,557
I accept.

436
00:30:33,602 --> 00:30:35,695
Good, then pour the wine.

437
00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:53,411
Inhale this, but do not touch.

438
00:30:55,224 --> 00:30:57,055
I smell nothing.

439
00:30:57,126 --> 00:30:59,185
What you do not smell is called iocane powder.

440
00:30:59,228 --> 00:31:02,031
It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid...

441
00:31:02,031 --> 00:31:05,592
and is among the more deadly poisons known to man.

442
00:31:27,222 --> 00:31:29,690
All right. Where is the poison?

443
00:31:29,725 --> 00:31:32,353
The battle of wits has begun.

444
00:31:32,428 --> 00:31:34,396
It ends when you decide, and we both drink...

445
00:31:34,463 --> 00:31:36,090
and find out who is right...

446
00:31:36,165 --> 00:31:38,360
and who is dead.

447
00:31:38,434 --> 00:31:40,664
But it's so simple.

448
00:31:40,736 --> 00:31:43,705
All I have to do is divine from what I know of you...

449
00:31:43,739 --> 00:31:45,674
are you the sort of man...

450
00:31:45,674 --> 00:31:48,734
who would put the poison into his own goblet or his enemy's?

451
00:31:48,811 --> 00:31:50,176
A clever man would put the poison...

452
00:31:50,212 --> 00:31:51,406
into his own goblet...

453
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,315
because he would know that only a great fool...

454
00:31:53,315 --> 00:31:55,044
would reach for what he was given.

455
00:31:55,117 --> 00:31:56,418
I am not a great fool...

456
00:31:56,418 --> 00:31:59,221
so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.

457
00:31:59,221 --> 00:32:01,746
But you must have known I was not a great fool.

458
00:32:01,824 --> 00:32:03,225
You would have counted on it...

459
00:32:03,225 --> 00:32:06,217
so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.

460
00:32:06,295 --> 00:32:07,630
You've made your decision, then?

461
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,931
Not remotely...

462
00:32:08,931 --> 00:32:12,334
because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows...

463
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:14,802
and Australia is entirely peopled with criminals...

464
00:32:14,837 --> 00:32:17,539
and criminals are used to having people not trust them...

465
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:19,006
as you are not trusted by me...

466
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:21,601
so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.

467
00:32:21,644 --> 00:32:23,771
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.

468
00:32:23,846 --> 00:32:25,837
Wait till I get going!

469
00:32:25,914 --> 00:32:27,814
- Where was I? - Australia.

470
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,750
Yes, Australia. You must have suspected...

471
00:32:29,818 --> 00:32:31,553
I would have known the powder's origin...

472
00:32:31,553 --> 00:32:34,078
so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.

473
00:32:34,156 --> 00:32:35,384
You're just stalling now.

474
00:32:35,457 --> 00:32:37,760
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?

475
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,057
You've beaten my giant...

476
00:32:39,128 --> 00:32:41,028
which means you're exceptionally strong...

477
00:32:41,063 --> 00:32:42,963
so you could have put the poison in your own goblet...

478
00:32:43,032 --> 00:32:44,767
trusting on your strength to save you...

479
00:32:44,767 --> 00:32:47,361
so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.

480
00:32:47,436 --> 00:32:49,872
But you've also bested my Spaniard...

481
00:32:49,872 --> 00:32:51,273
which means you must have studied...

482
00:32:51,273 --> 00:32:54,333
and in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal...

483
00:32:54,376 --> 00:32:56,173
so you would have put the poison...

484
00:32:56,245 --> 00:32:58,213
as far from yourself as possible...

485
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,578
so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.

486
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:02,549
You're trying to trick me into giving away something.

487
00:33:02,584 --> 00:33:03,676
It won't work.

488
00:33:03,752 --> 00:33:05,879
It has worked. You've given everything away.

489
00:33:05,954 --> 00:33:08,650
- I know where the poison is. - Then make your choice.

490
00:33:08,724 --> 00:33:12,182
I will, and I choose... What in the world can that be?

491
00:33:12,227 --> 00:33:13,626
What? Where?

492
00:33:15,297 --> 00:33:17,356
I don't see anything.

493
00:33:17,433 --> 00:33:20,300
I could have sworn I saw something. No matter.

494
00:33:22,805 --> 00:33:24,363
What's so funny?

495
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,241
I'll tell you in a minute.

496
00:33:26,241 --> 00:33:27,743
First, let's drink...

497
00:33:27,743 --> 00:33:30,974
me from my glass and you from yours.

498
00:33:45,461 --> 00:33:46,689
You guessed wrong.

499
00:33:46,762 --> 00:33:49,492
You only think I guessed wrong. That's what's so funny!

500
00:33:49,565 --> 00:33:51,624
I switched glasses when your back was turned!

501
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:53,157
You fool!

502
00:33:53,235 --> 00:33:55,726
You fell victim to one of the classic blunders.

503
00:33:55,771 --> 00:33:58,865
The most famous is ''Never get involved in a land war in Asia.''

504
00:33:58,941 --> 00:34:01,777
But only slightly less well known is this...

505
00:34:01,777 --> 00:34:06,077
''Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line! ''

506
00:34:20,562 --> 00:34:22,189
Who are you?

507
00:34:22,264 --> 00:34:24,494
I am no one to be trifled with.

508
00:34:24,566 --> 00:34:26,864
That is all you ever need know.

509
00:34:26,935 --> 00:34:28,630
And to think, all that time...

510
00:34:28,704 --> 00:34:30,331
it was your cup that was poisoned.

511
00:34:30,405 --> 00:34:32,236
They were both poisoned.

512
00:34:32,307 --> 00:34:34,400
I spent the last few years...

513
00:34:34,443 --> 00:34:37,901
building up an immunity to iocane powder.

514
00:34:39,815 --> 00:34:42,283
Someone has beaten the giant.

515
00:34:43,318 --> 00:34:48,119
There will be great suffering in Guilder if she dies.

516
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:04,237
Catch your breath.

517
00:35:04,273 --> 00:35:05,574
If you'll release me...

518
00:35:05,574 --> 00:35:08,975
whatever you ask for ransom, you'll get it. I promise you.

519
00:35:10,379 --> 00:35:13,837
And what is that worth... the promise of a woman?

520
00:35:13,882 --> 00:35:15,509
You're very funny, Highness.

521
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,386
I was giving you a chance.

522
00:35:17,386 --> 00:35:19,752
It does not matter where you take me...

523
00:35:19,788 --> 00:35:22,191
there is no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck.

524
00:35:22,191 --> 00:35:24,193
He can track a falcon on a cloudy day.

525
00:35:24,193 --> 00:35:25,490
He can find you.

526
00:35:25,561 --> 00:35:27,085
You think your dearest love will save you?

527
00:35:27,162 --> 00:35:28,789
I never said he was my dearest love.

528
00:35:28,864 --> 00:35:31,600
And, yes, he will save me. That I know.

529
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,229


530
00:35:35,304 --> 00:35:36,862
He knows I do not love him.

531
00:35:36,905 --> 00:35:39,100
Are not capable of love is what you mean.

532
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:42,911
I have loved more deeply...

533
00:35:42,911 --> 00:35:45,937
than a killer like yourself could ever dream.

534
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,247
That was a warning, Highness.

535
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:52,719
The next time, my hand flies on its own.

536
00:35:52,754 --> 00:35:55,723
Where I come from, there are penalties when a woman lies.

537
00:36:00,229 --> 00:36:03,289
Iocane. I'd bet my life on it...

538
00:36:03,332 --> 00:36:06,199
and there are the princess' footprints.

539
00:36:06,235 --> 00:36:09,534
She is alive, or was an hour ago.

540
00:36:09,571 --> 00:36:12,699
If she is otherwise when I find her...

541
00:36:12,741 --> 00:36:16,142
I shall be very put out.

542
00:36:21,016 --> 00:36:23,610
- Rest, Highness. - I know who you are.

543
00:36:23,652 --> 00:36:25,916
Your cruelty reveals everything.

544
00:36:25,954 --> 00:36:28,115
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts. Admit it.

545
00:36:28,156 --> 00:36:31,592
With pride. What can I do for you?

546
00:36:31,627 --> 00:36:34,619
You can die slowly, cut into a thousand pieces.

547
00:36:36,431 --> 00:36:37,728
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness.

548
00:36:37,766 --> 00:36:40,257
Why loose your venom on me?

549
00:36:40,302 --> 00:36:43,271
You killed my love.

550
00:36:43,305 --> 00:36:45,239
It's possible.

551
00:36:45,274 --> 00:36:47,708
I kill a lot of people.

552
00:36:47,743 --> 00:36:50,234
Who was this love of yours?

553
00:36:50,279 --> 00:36:55,046
Another prince like this one... ugly, rich, and scabby?

554
00:36:56,285 --> 00:36:58,480
A farm boy, poor.

555
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:04,220
Poor and perfect with eyes like the sea after a storm.

556
00:37:07,663 --> 00:37:09,221
On the high seas, your ship attacked.

557
00:37:09,264 --> 00:37:11,732
And the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.

558
00:37:11,767 --> 00:37:13,394
I can't afford to make exceptions.

559
00:37:13,435 --> 00:37:15,562
Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft...

560
00:37:15,604 --> 00:37:16,901
people begin to disobey you...

561
00:37:16,939 --> 00:37:19,203
and then it's nothing but work, work, work all the time.

562
00:37:19,241 --> 00:37:20,708
You mock my pain.

563
00:37:20,742 --> 00:37:22,232
Life is pain, Highness.

564
00:37:22,277 --> 00:37:25,576
Anyone who says differently is selling something.

565
00:37:29,284 --> 00:37:32,742
I remember this farm boy of yours, I think.

566
00:37:32,788 --> 00:37:35,689
This would be, what, five years ago?

567
00:37:35,724 --> 00:37:38,750
Does it bother you to hear?

568
00:37:38,794 --> 00:37:41,957
Nothing you can say will upset me.

569
00:37:41,997 --> 00:37:43,760
He died well.

570
00:37:43,799 --> 00:37:45,767
That should please you.

571
00:37:45,801 --> 00:37:48,770
No bribe attempts or blubbering.

572
00:37:48,804 --> 00:37:51,272
He simply said, ''Please...

573
00:37:51,306 --> 00:37:54,707
''please, I need to live.''

574
00:37:54,743 --> 00:37:57,769
It was the please that caught my memory.

575
00:37:57,813 --> 00:38:00,338
I asked him what was so important.

576
00:38:00,382 --> 00:38:02,748
''True love,'' he replied.

577
00:38:05,921 --> 00:38:07,479
Then he spoke of a girl...

578
00:38:07,522 --> 00:38:09,456
of surpassing beauty and faithfulness.

579
00:38:09,491 --> 00:38:11,959
I can only assume he meant you.

580
00:38:11,994 --> 00:38:13,723
You should bless me for destroying him...

581
00:38:13,762 --> 00:38:16,629
before he found out what you really are.

582
00:38:16,665 --> 00:38:17,996
And what am I?

583
00:38:18,033 --> 00:38:19,466
Faithfulness he talked of, madam...

584
00:38:19,501 --> 00:38:20,695
your enduring faithfulness.

585
00:38:20,736 --> 00:38:22,704
Tell me truly. When you found out he was gone...

586
00:38:22,738 --> 00:38:24,205
did you get engaged to your prince that same hour...

587
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:26,366
or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?

588
00:38:26,408 --> 00:38:28,774
You mocked me once. Never do it again!

589
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,675
I died that day!

590
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,741
You can die, too, for all I care!

591
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,453
As... you... wish!

592
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,788
My sweet Westley.

593
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:46,157
What have I done?

594
00:39:05,514 --> 00:39:07,243
They've disappeared.

595
00:39:07,282 --> 00:39:09,750
He must've seen us closing in...

596
00:39:09,785 --> 00:39:12,253
which might account for his panicking into error.

597
00:39:12,287 --> 00:39:15,256
Unless I'm wrong, and I am never wrong...

598
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:18,282
they are headed dead into the Fire Swamp.

599
00:39:29,304 --> 00:39:31,272
Can you move at all?

600
00:39:31,306 --> 00:39:34,275
Move? You're alive.

601
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:36,800
If you want, I can fly.

602
00:39:41,516 --> 00:39:43,780
I told you I would always come for you.

603
00:39:43,819 --> 00:39:46,185
Why didn't you wait for me?

604
00:39:46,221 --> 00:39:47,813
Well...

605
00:39:47,856 --> 00:39:49,653
you were dead.

606
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:51,750
Death cannot stop true love.

607
00:39:53,628 --> 00:39:55,960
All it can do is delay it for a while.

608
00:39:57,365 --> 00:39:59,595
I will never doubt again.

609
00:39:59,634 --> 00:40:03,001
There will never be a need.

610
00:40:05,874 --> 00:40:08,365
Oh, no. No, please.

611
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,537
What is it? What's the matter?

612
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:12,342
They're kissing again.

613
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,110
Do we have to hear the kissing part?

614
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,584
Someday you may not mind so much.

615
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:21,020
Skip on to the Fire Swamp. That sounded good.

616
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:25,359
You're sick. I'll humor you.

617
00:40:25,393 --> 00:40:27,884
So now, where were we here?

618
00:40:30,632 --> 00:40:35,626
Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.

619
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:39,106


620
00:40:41,076 --> 00:40:43,943
A few more steps, and we'll be safe in the Fire Swamp.

621
00:40:43,979 --> 00:40:45,879
We'll never survive.

622
00:40:45,914 --> 00:40:49,577
Nonsense! You only say that because no one ever has.

623
00:41:16,244 --> 00:41:18,439
It's not that bad.

624
00:41:21,316 --> 00:41:23,045
I'm not saying I'd like to build a summer home here...

625
00:41:23,084 --> 00:41:25,109
but the trees are actually quite lovely.

626
00:42:02,924 --> 00:42:05,950
Well, now, that was an adventure.

627
00:42:05,994 --> 00:42:08,121
Singed a bit, were you?

628
00:42:08,163 --> 00:42:09,323
You?

629
00:42:16,238 --> 00:42:18,729
One thing I will say...

630
00:42:18,773 --> 00:42:23,301
the fire swamp certainly does keep you on your toes.

631
00:42:27,382 --> 00:42:30,783
This will all soon be but a happy memory...

632
00:42:30,819 --> 00:42:33,617
because Roberts' ship Revenge is anchored at the far end...

633
00:42:33,655 --> 00:42:35,455
and I, as you know, am Roberts.

634
00:42:35,855 --> 00:42:37,152
How is that possible...

635
00:42:37,189 --> 00:42:38,816
since he's been marauding twenty years...

636
00:42:38,858 --> 00:42:41,326
and you only left me five years ago?

637
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,820
I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks.

638
00:42:45,865 --> 00:42:50,825
What I told you before about saying please was true.

639
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:52,337
It intrigued Roberts...

640
00:42:52,371 --> 00:42:55,374
as did my description of your beauty.

641
00:42:55,374 --> 00:42:57,342
Finally, Roberts decided something.

642
00:42:57,376 --> 00:43:01,278
He said, ''All right, Westley, I've never had a valet.

643
00:43:01,314 --> 00:43:03,282
''You can try it for tonight.

644
00:43:03,316 --> 00:43:05,784
''I'll most likely kill you in the morning.''

645
00:43:05,818 --> 00:43:07,786
Three years he said that.

646
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,981
''Good night, Westley, good work. Sleep well.

647
00:43:10,022 --> 00:43:12,286
''I'll most likely kill you in the morning.''

648
00:43:12,325 --> 00:43:13,792
It was a fine time for me.

649
00:43:13,826 --> 00:43:17,284
I was learning to fence, fight, anything anyone would teach me.

650
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:19,298
And Roberts and I eventually became friends...

651
00:43:19,332 --> 00:43:21,300
and then it happened.

652
00:43:21,334 --> 00:43:23,427
What? Go on.

653
00:43:23,469 --> 00:43:26,802
Roberts had grown so rich, he wanted to retire...

654
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:30,810
so he took me to his cabin and told me his secret.

655
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:33,301
''I am not the Dread Pirate Roberts,'' he said.

656
00:43:33,346 --> 00:43:35,610
''My name is Ryan.

657
00:43:35,648 --> 00:43:38,344
''I inherited the ship from the previous Roberts...

658
00:43:38,384 --> 00:43:40,352
''just as you will inherit it from me.

659
00:43:40,386 --> 00:43:43,556
''The man I inherited it from wasn't the real Roberts, either.

660
00:43:43,556 --> 00:43:45,353
''His name was Cumberbund.

661
00:43:45,391 --> 00:43:48,360
''The real Roberts has been retired fifteen years...

662
00:43:48,394 --> 00:43:50,157
''and living like a king.'' Thank you.

663
00:43:50,196 --> 00:43:52,858
Then he explained the name was the important thing...

664
00:43:52,898 --> 00:43:54,866
for inspiring the necessary fear.

665
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,871
You see, no one would surrender to the Dread Pirate Westley.

666
00:43:58,871 --> 00:44:02,307
So we sailed ashore, took on an entirely new crew.

667
00:44:02,341 --> 00:44:04,809
And he stayed aboard for a while as first mate...

668
00:44:04,844 --> 00:44:06,311
all the time calling me Roberts.

669
00:44:06,345 --> 00:44:08,813
Once the crew believed, he left the ship...

670
00:44:08,848 --> 00:44:10,816
and I have been Roberts ever since.

671
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:12,841
Except, now that we're together...

672
00:44:12,885 --> 00:44:15,353
I shall retire and hand the name over to someone else.

673
00:44:15,388 --> 00:44:17,322
Is everything clear to you?

674
00:45:49,715 --> 00:45:52,809
We'll never succeed.

675
00:45:52,852 --> 00:45:55,320
We may as well die here.

676
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:00,982
No, we have already succeeded.

677
00:46:02,428 --> 00:46:06,228
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp?

678
00:46:06,265 --> 00:46:09,359
One, the flame spurt. No problem.

679
00:46:09,401 --> 00:46:11,301
There's a popping sound preceding each.

680
00:46:11,337 --> 00:46:13,305
We can avoid that.

681
00:46:13,339 --> 00:46:14,806
Two, the lightning sand.

682
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,808
But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like...

683
00:46:16,842 --> 00:46:19,072
so in the future, we can avoid that, too.

684
00:46:19,111 --> 00:46:21,409
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S. S?

685
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,811
Rodents of Unusual Size?

686
00:46:22,882 --> 00:46:25,112
I don't think they exist.

687
00:48:16,395 --> 00:48:18,386
We did it.

688
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:22,128
Now, was that so terrible?

689
00:48:33,145 --> 00:48:34,772
Surrender!

690
00:48:34,813 --> 00:48:36,678
You mean you wish to surrender to me?

691
00:48:36,715 --> 00:48:37,909
Very well. I accept.

692
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:40,384
I give you full marks for bravery.

693
00:48:40,419 --> 00:48:42,478
Don't make yourself a fool.

694
00:48:42,521 --> 00:48:43,681
But how will you capture us?

695
00:48:43,722 --> 00:48:45,383
We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp.

696
00:48:45,424 --> 00:48:47,392
We can live there quite happily for some time...

697
00:48:47,426 --> 00:48:49,656
so whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.

698
00:48:49,695 --> 00:48:52,892
I tell you once again, surrender!

699
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:54,455
It will not happen.

700
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,695
For the last time, surrender!

701
00:48:56,735 --> 00:48:58,066
Death first!

702
00:48:58,103 --> 00:49:00,071
Will you promise not to hurt him?!

703
00:49:00,105 --> 00:49:02,630
- What was that? - What was that?

704
00:49:02,675 --> 00:49:05,872
If we surrender and I return with you...

705
00:49:05,911 --> 00:49:09,278
will you promise not to hurt this man?

706
00:49:09,314 --> 00:49:12,909
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.

707
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:15,920
He is a sailor on the pirate ship Revenge.

708
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:18,320
Promise to return him to his ship.

709
00:49:18,357 --> 00:49:20,917
I swear it will be done.

710
00:49:23,095 --> 00:49:25,029
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin...

711
00:49:25,064 --> 00:49:27,430
and throw him in the Pit of Despair.

712
00:49:27,466 --> 00:49:30,128
I swear it will be done.

713
00:49:30,169 --> 00:49:35,072
I thought you were dead once, and it almost destroyed me.

714
00:49:35,107 --> 00:49:37,632
I could not bear it if you died again...

715
00:49:37,676 --> 00:49:40,509
not when I could save you.

716
00:49:52,391 --> 00:49:53,858
Come, sir.

717
00:49:53,892 --> 00:49:56,190
We must get you to your ship.

718
00:50:02,901 --> 00:50:04,869
We are men of action.

719
00:50:04,903 --> 00:50:07,235
Lies do not become us.

720
00:50:07,272 --> 00:50:10,469
Well spoken, sir.

721
00:50:17,249 --> 00:50:19,012
What is it?

722
00:50:19,051 --> 00:50:21,451
You have six fingers on your right hand.

723
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,648
Someone was looking for you.

724
00:51:09,001 --> 00:51:10,366
Where am I?

725
00:51:10,402 --> 00:51:12,927
The Pit of Despair.

726
00:51:12,971 --> 00:51:14,336
Don't even think...

727
00:51:17,476 --> 00:51:19,944
Don't even think about trying to escape.

728
00:51:19,978 --> 00:51:22,037
The chains are far too thick.

729
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,708
And don't dream of being rescued, either.

730
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,741
The only way in is secret.

731
00:51:26,785 --> 00:51:28,650
Only the prince, the count, and I...

732
00:51:28,687 --> 00:51:30,951
know how to get in and out.

733
00:51:30,989 --> 00:51:32,923
Then I'm here till I die?

734
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:35,085
Till they kill you, yeah.

735
00:51:39,531 --> 00:51:41,590
Then why bother curing me?

736
00:51:41,633 --> 00:51:44,761
The prince and count insist on everyone being healthy...

737
00:51:44,837 --> 00:51:46,304
before they're broken.

738
00:51:46,338 --> 00:51:47,862
So it's to be torture.

739
00:51:49,141 --> 00:51:51,439
I can cope with torture.

740
00:51:53,045 --> 00:51:55,513
You don't believe me?

741
00:51:55,547 --> 00:51:57,777
You survived the Fire Swamp.

742
00:51:57,850 --> 00:51:59,818
You must be very brave...

743
00:51:59,852 --> 00:52:03,049
but nobody withstands the Machine.

744
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:20,304
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.

745
00:52:20,339 --> 00:52:24,776
It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.

746
00:52:24,843 --> 00:52:26,310
Of course.

747
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:31,780
The king died that very night...

748
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:34,318
and before the following dawn...

749
00:52:34,353 --> 00:52:36,913
Buttercup and Humperdinck were married.

750
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:39,219
And at noon, she met her subjects again...

751
00:52:39,291 --> 00:52:41,193
this time, as their queen.

752
00:52:41,193 --> 00:52:43,718
My father's final words were...

753
00:52:43,795 --> 00:52:45,763
Hold it! Hold it, Grandpa.

754
00:52:45,797 --> 00:52:47,264
You read that wrong.

755
00:52:47,299 --> 00:52:49,893
She doesn't marry Humperdinck. She marries Westley.

756
00:52:49,968 --> 00:52:51,303
I'm just sure of it.

757
00:52:51,303 --> 00:52:53,362
After all that Westley did for her...

758
00:52:53,405 --> 00:52:56,397
if she didn't marry him, it wouldn't be fair.

759
00:52:56,475 --> 00:52:58,238
Who says life is fair?

760
00:52:58,310 --> 00:52:59,800
Where is that written?

761
00:52:59,845 --> 00:53:01,870
Life isn't always fair.

762
00:53:01,947 --> 00:53:04,415
I'm telling you, you're messing up the story!

763
00:53:04,449 --> 00:53:05,939
Now, get it right!

764
00:53:06,018 --> 00:53:08,248
Do you want me to go on with this?

765
00:53:09,354 --> 00:53:11,822
All right, then, no more interruptions.

766
00:53:11,857 --> 00:53:14,325
''At noon, she met her subjects again...

767
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:16,561
this time, as their queen.''

768
00:53:16,561 --> 00:53:19,792
My father's final words were...

769
00:53:19,865 --> 00:53:25,394
''Love her as I loved her, and there will be joy.''

770
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:28,462
I present to you your queen!

771
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:32,101
Queen Buttercup!

772
00:53:49,594 --> 00:53:51,096
Why do you do this?

773
00:53:51,096 --> 00:53:55,032
You had love in your hands, and you gave it up!

774
00:53:55,067 --> 00:53:57,535
They would have killed Westley if I hadn't done it.

775
00:53:57,602 --> 00:54:00,806
Your true love lives, and you marry another!

776
00:54:00,806 --> 00:54:04,264
True love saved her in the Fire Swamp...

777
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:06,311
and she treated it like garbage!

778
00:54:06,311 --> 00:54:10,115
And that's what she is... the Queen of Refuse!

779
00:54:10,115 --> 00:54:12,918
So bow down to her if you want! Bow to her!

780
00:54:12,918 --> 00:54:15,320
Bow to the Queen of Slime!

781
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,822
The Queen of Filth!

782
00:54:16,822 --> 00:54:18,949
The Queen of Putrescence!

783
00:54:21,226 --> 00:54:25,663
Rubbish! Filth! Slime! Muck!

784
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:33,701
It was ten days till the wedding.

785
00:54:33,772 --> 00:54:35,569
The king still lived.

786
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:38,973
But Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.

787
00:54:39,044 --> 00:54:42,445
See? Didn't I say she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?

788
00:54:42,481 --> 00:54:44,540
Yes, you're very smart. Shut up.

789
00:54:44,683 --> 00:54:46,275
It comes to this.

790
00:54:46,351 --> 00:54:49,514
I love Westley. I always have.

791
00:54:49,588 --> 00:54:51,954
I know now I always will.

792
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:55,084
If you tell me I must marry you in ten days...

793
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,685
please believe I will be dead by morning.

794
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:07,805
I could never cause you grief.

795
00:55:07,873 --> 00:55:09,841
Consider our wedding off.

796
00:55:11,276 --> 00:55:13,676
You returned this...

797
00:55:13,712 --> 00:55:15,839
Westley to his ship?

798
00:55:16,882 --> 00:55:19,214
Then we will simply alert him.

799
00:55:19,284 --> 00:55:26,190
Beloved... are you certain he still wants you?

800
00:55:26,224 --> 00:55:30,429
After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp.

801
00:55:30,429 --> 00:55:34,833
Not to mention that pirates are not known as men of their words.

802
00:55:34,833 --> 00:55:37,358
My Westley will always come for me.

803
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:45,866
I suggest a deal.

804
00:55:45,944 --> 00:55:49,081
You write four copies of a letter.

805
00:55:49,081 --> 00:55:52,482
I'll send my four fastest ships, one in each direction.

806
00:55:52,551 --> 00:55:53,779
The Dread Pirate Roberts...

807
00:55:53,852 --> 00:55:55,843
is always close to Florin this time of year.

808
00:55:55,887 --> 00:55:58,856
We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message.

809
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:02,189
If Westley wants you, bless you both.

810
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:04,558
If not...

811
00:56:07,899 --> 00:56:11,596
please consider me as an alternative to suicide.

812
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:13,900
Are we agreed?

813
00:56:17,409 --> 00:56:21,345
Your princess is really quite a winning creature.

814
00:56:21,379 --> 00:56:24,015
A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.

815
00:56:24,015 --> 00:56:26,142
I know. The people are quite taken with her.

816
00:56:26,218 --> 00:56:29,585
It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini...

817
00:56:29,621 --> 00:56:31,418
to have her murdered on our engagement day...

818
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:32,616
I thought that was clever.

819
00:56:32,691 --> 00:56:34,181
But it's going to be so much more moving...

820
00:56:34,226 --> 00:56:36,820
when I strangle her on our wedding night.

821
00:56:36,895 --> 00:56:38,330
Once Guilder is blamed...

822
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:40,298
the nation will be truly outraged.

823
00:56:40,332 --> 00:56:42,630
They'll demand we go to war.

824
00:56:45,403 --> 00:56:48,839
Now, where is that secret knot?

825
00:56:48,907 --> 00:56:51,205
It's impossible to find.

826
00:56:53,912 --> 00:56:56,813
Are you coming down into the pit?

827
00:56:56,848 --> 00:56:58,372
Westley's got his strength back.

828
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:00,941
I'm starting him on the Machine tonight.

829
00:57:00,986 --> 00:57:04,683
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work...

830
00:57:04,756 --> 00:57:08,248
but I've got my country's 500th anniversary to plan...

831
00:57:08,293 --> 00:57:10,761
my wedding to arrange, my wife to murder...

832
00:57:10,795 --> 00:57:14,196
and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped.

833
00:57:17,169 --> 00:57:18,898
Get some rest.

834
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:21,905
If you haven't got your health, you haven't got anything.

835
00:57:38,423 --> 00:57:39,913
Beautiful, isn't it?

836
00:57:39,991 --> 00:57:44,329
It took me half a lifetime to invent it.

837
00:57:44,329 --> 00:57:45,853
I'm sure you've discovered...

838
00:57:45,931 --> 00:57:48,559
my deep and abiding interest in pain.

839
00:57:48,633 --> 00:57:50,157
At present, I'm writing the definitive work...

840
00:57:50,235 --> 00:57:51,793
on the subject.

841
00:57:51,836 --> 00:57:53,963
So I want you to be totally honest with me...

842
00:57:54,039 --> 00:57:56,241
on how the Machine makes you feel.

843
00:57:56,241 --> 00:58:00,940
This being our first try, I'll use the lowest setting.

844
00:58:36,414 --> 00:58:39,417
As you know, the concept of the suction pump...

845
00:58:39,417 --> 00:58:40,782
is centuries old.

846
00:58:40,919 --> 00:58:43,183
Well, really, that's all this is.

847
00:58:43,221 --> 00:58:45,621
Except that, instead of sucking water...

848
00:58:45,657 --> 00:58:47,682
I'm sucking life.

849
00:58:47,726 --> 00:58:51,253
I've just sucked one year of your life away.

850
00:58:51,296 --> 00:58:54,356
I might one day go as high as five...

851
00:58:54,399 --> 00:58:57,197
but I really don't know what that would do to you...

852
00:58:57,235 --> 00:58:59,499
so let's just start with what we have.

853
00:58:59,537 --> 00:59:02,836
What did this do to you? Tell me.

854
00:59:02,874 --> 00:59:04,705
And remember, this is for posterity...

855
00:59:04,743 --> 00:59:06,210
so be honest.

856
00:59:06,244 --> 00:59:08,371
How do you feel?

857
00:59:12,751 --> 00:59:14,275
Interesting.

858
00:59:24,763 --> 00:59:25,889
Yellin.

859
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:27,397
Sire.

860
00:59:37,108 --> 00:59:41,738
As chief enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret.

861
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,304
Killers from Guilder...

862
00:59:43,348 --> 00:59:44,975
are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest...

863
00:59:45,016 --> 00:59:49,749
and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.

864
00:59:49,788 --> 00:59:52,621
My spy network has heard no such news.

865
00:59:52,657 --> 00:59:54,022
Any word from Westley?

866
00:59:55,794 --> 00:59:58,194
Too soon, my angel.

867
00:59:58,229 --> 00:59:59,662
Patience.

868
00:59:59,698 --> 01:00:00,995
He will come for me.

869
01:00:01,032 --> 01:00:02,863
Of course.

870
01:00:07,305 --> 01:00:09,273
She will not be murdered.

871
01:00:09,307 --> 01:00:10,604
On the day of the wedding...

872
01:00:10,642 --> 01:00:12,269
I want the Thieves' Forest emptied...

873
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:15,040
and every inhabitant arrested.

874
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,775
Many of the thieves will resist.

875
01:00:16,815 --> 01:00:19,511
My regular enforcers will be inadequate.

876
01:00:19,551 --> 01:00:21,712
Form a brute squad, then!

877
01:00:21,753 --> 01:00:24,813
I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.

878
01:00:24,856 --> 01:00:26,517
It won't be easy, sire.

879
01:00:26,558 --> 01:00:28,753
Try ruling the world sometime.

880
01:00:33,331 --> 01:00:35,731
The day of the wedding arrived.

881
01:00:35,767 --> 01:00:38,736
The brute squad had their hands full...

882
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:40,738
carrying out Humperdinck's orders.

883
01:00:40,772 --> 01:00:43,240
Up! Up! Up!

884
01:00:43,274 --> 01:00:46,641
Come on! Come on!

885
01:00:46,678 --> 01:00:48,145
- Is everybody out? - Almost.

886
01:00:48,179 --> 01:00:50,238
There's a Spaniard giving us some trouble.

887
01:00:50,281 --> 01:00:52,545
Well, you give him some trouble.

888
01:00:53,651 --> 01:00:54,811
Move.

889
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:01,285
I am waiting for you, Vizzini.

890
01:01:01,326 --> 01:01:06,958
You told me to go back to the beginning, so I have.

891
01:01:06,998 --> 01:01:11,367
This is where I am, and this is where I'll stay.

892
01:01:11,403 --> 01:01:14,031
I will not be moved.

893
01:01:14,072 --> 01:01:15,437
Ho there!

894
01:01:15,473 --> 01:01:18,840
I do not budge. Keep your ''ho there.''

895
01:01:18,877 --> 01:01:20,469
The prince gave orders.

896
01:01:23,481 --> 01:01:25,108
So did Vizzini.

897
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:27,550
When a job went wrong, you went back to the beginning.

898
01:01:27,585 --> 01:01:31,385
This is where we got the job, so it's the beginning.

899
01:01:31,423 --> 01:01:33,414
And I am staying till Vizzini come.

900
01:01:33,458 --> 01:01:34,891
You brute, come here!

901
01:01:34,926 --> 01:01:40,387
I am waiting for Vizzini.

902
01:01:40,432 --> 01:01:42,923
You surely are a meanie.

903
01:01:51,943 --> 01:01:53,672
It's you.

904
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:55,474
True.

905
01:01:57,015 --> 01:01:58,949
You don't look so good.

906
01:02:00,452 --> 01:02:03,114
You don't smell so good, either.

907
01:02:03,154 --> 01:02:04,917
Perhaps not.

908
01:02:04,956 --> 01:02:06,787
I feel fine.

909
01:02:10,929 --> 01:02:13,489
Fezzik and Inigo were reunited.

910
01:02:13,531 --> 01:02:17,023
As Fezzik nursed his inebriated friend back to health...

911
01:02:17,068 --> 01:02:19,366
he told Inigo of Vizzini's death...

912
01:02:19,404 --> 01:02:21,031
and the existence of Count Rugen...

913
01:02:21,072 --> 01:02:22,369
the six-fingered man.

914
01:02:22,407 --> 01:02:24,932
Considering Inigo's lifelong search...

915
01:02:24,976 --> 01:02:27,501
he handled the news surprisingly well.

916
01:02:30,014 --> 01:02:33,074
Fezzik took great care in reviving Inigo.

917
01:02:33,117 --> 01:02:34,550
That's enough!

918
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:39,723
Where is this Rugen now so I may kill him?

919
01:02:39,757 --> 01:02:41,952
He's with the prince in the castle...

920
01:02:41,993 --> 01:02:45,053
but the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.

921
01:02:49,167 --> 01:02:51,431
How many could you handle?

922
01:02:51,469 --> 01:02:53,630
I don't think more than ten.

923
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:00,102
Leaving twenty for me.

924
01:03:01,513 --> 01:03:03,777
At my best, I could never defeat that many.

925
01:03:07,252 --> 01:03:10,688
I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy.

926
01:03:10,722 --> 01:03:12,417
But Vizzini is dead.

927
01:03:12,457 --> 01:03:16,484
No. Not Vizzini.

928
01:03:16,528 --> 01:03:18,894
I need the man in black.

929
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:20,124
What?

930
01:03:20,164 --> 01:03:22,997
He bested you with strength, your greatness.

931
01:03:23,034 --> 01:03:25,002
He bested me with steel.

932
01:03:25,036 --> 01:03:27,504
He must have out-thought Vizzini.

933
01:03:27,539 --> 01:03:32,101
A man who can do that can plan my castle onslaught any day.

934
01:03:32,143 --> 01:03:33,235
- Let's go. - Where?

935
01:03:33,278 --> 01:03:35,246
Find the man in black, obviously.

936
01:03:35,246 --> 01:03:36,645
But you don't know where he is.

937
01:03:36,681 --> 01:03:38,171
Don't bother me with trifles.

938
01:03:38,216 --> 01:03:39,342
After twenty years, at last...

939
01:03:39,384 --> 01:03:41,477
my father's soul will be at peace.

940
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:43,487
There will be blood tonight!

941
01:03:53,932 --> 01:03:56,230
Rise and report.

942
01:03:56,267 --> 01:03:58,132
The Thieves' Forest is emptied.

943
01:03:58,169 --> 01:03:59,431
Thirty men guard the castle gate.

944
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:01,062
Double it.

945
01:04:01,105 --> 01:04:02,936
My princess must be safe.

946
01:04:02,974 --> 01:04:05,465
The gate has but one key...

947
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:08,843
and I carry that.

948
01:04:12,483 --> 01:04:14,474
My dulcet darling!

949
01:04:16,588 --> 01:04:18,715
Tonight, we marry.

950
01:04:18,756 --> 01:04:22,157
Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel...

951
01:04:22,193 --> 01:04:24,457
where every ship in my armada...

952
01:04:24,495 --> 01:04:27,487
waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.

953
01:04:27,532 --> 01:04:30,092
Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.

954
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:34,970
Every ship but the four you sent.

955
01:04:35,006 --> 01:04:36,906
Yes, of course.

956
01:04:36,941 --> 01:04:39,000
Naturally, not those four.

957
01:04:40,545 --> 01:04:42,672
Your Majesties.

958
01:04:46,351 --> 01:04:48,376
You never sent the ships.

959
01:04:48,419 --> 01:04:50,979
Don't bother lying.

960
01:04:51,022 --> 01:04:52,421
It doesn't matter.

961
01:04:52,457 --> 01:04:54,448
Westley will come for me, anyway:

962
01:04:54,492 --> 01:04:56,392
You're a silly girl.

963
01:04:56,427 --> 01:04:57,951
Yes, I am a silly girl...

964
01:04:57,996 --> 01:05:01,159
for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward...

965
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:03,326
with a heart full of fear.

966
01:05:03,368 --> 01:05:08,135
I would not say such things if I were you.

967
01:05:08,172 --> 01:05:10,970
Why not? You can't hurt me.

968
01:05:11,009 --> 01:05:15,070
Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love...

969
01:05:15,113 --> 01:05:16,978
and you cannot track that...

970
01:05:17,015 --> 01:05:19,745
not with a thousand bloodhounds...

971
01:05:19,784 --> 01:05:21,979
and you cannot break it...

972
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:23,988
not with a thousand swords.

973
01:05:24,022 --> 01:05:25,990
And when I say you are a coward...

974
01:05:26,024 --> 01:05:27,992
that is only because you are the slimiest weakling...

975
01:05:28,026 --> 01:05:30,051
ever to crawl the earth.

976
01:05:32,063 --> 01:05:36,090
I would not say such things if I were you!

977
01:05:50,481 --> 01:05:52,449
You truly love each other...

978
01:05:52,483 --> 01:05:54,474
and so you might have been truly happy.

979
01:05:54,519 --> 01:05:56,783
Not one couple in a century has that chance...

980
01:05:56,821 --> 01:05:58,982
no matter what the storybooks say.

981
01:05:59,023 --> 01:06:01,992
So I think no man in a century...

982
01:06:02,026 --> 01:06:05,052
will suffer as greatly as you will.

983
01:06:08,232 --> 01:06:09,460
Not to fifty!

984
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:35,259
Listen. Do you hear?

985
01:06:35,259 --> 01:06:37,523
That is the sound of ultimate suffering.

986
01:06:37,562 --> 01:06:41,555
My heart made that sound when Rugen slaughtered my father.

987
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:43,260
The man in black makes it now.

988
01:06:43,301 --> 01:06:44,563
The man in black?

989
01:06:44,602 --> 01:06:46,433
His true love is marrying another tonight.

990
01:06:46,471 --> 01:06:48,803
Who else has the cause for ultimate suffering?

991
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:52,003
Excuse me. Pardon me, it's important.

992
01:06:52,043 --> 01:06:53,533
Fezzik, please.

993
01:06:53,578 --> 01:06:55,102
Everybody, move!

994
01:06:55,146 --> 01:06:56,545
Thank you.

995
01:07:04,889 --> 01:07:07,517
Where is the man in black?

996
01:07:07,558 --> 01:07:09,788
You get there from this grove, yes?

997
01:07:11,129 --> 01:07:13,393
Fezzik, jog his memory.

998
01:07:17,869 --> 01:07:19,860
I'm sorry, Inigo.

999
01:07:19,904 --> 01:07:22,839
I didn't mean to jog him so hard.

1000
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:31,380
Father, I have failed you for twenty years.

1001
01:07:31,415 --> 01:07:33,883
Now our misery can end.

1002
01:07:33,918 --> 01:07:35,852
Somewhere...

1003
01:07:35,887 --> 01:07:40,847
somewhere close by is a man who can help us.

1004
01:07:40,892 --> 01:07:43,861
I cannot find him alone.

1005
01:07:43,895 --> 01:07:46,864
I need you.

1006
01:07:46,898 --> 01:07:49,867
I need you to guide my sword.

1007
01:07:49,901 --> 01:07:51,425
Please.

1008
01:07:52,904 --> 01:07:55,395
Guide my sword.

1009
01:08:45,389 --> 01:08:47,050
He's dead.

1010
01:08:47,091 --> 01:08:49,559
It just is not fair.

1011
01:08:49,594 --> 01:08:51,459
Grandpa, wait!

1012
01:08:51,495 --> 01:08:56,057
Wait. What did Fezzik mean, ''He's dead''?

1013
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:58,898
I mean, he didn't mean dead.

1014
01:08:58,936 --> 01:09:02,463
Westley's only faking... right?

1015
01:09:02,506 --> 01:09:05,202
You want me to read this or not?

1016
01:09:05,243 --> 01:09:07,473
Who gets Humperdinck?

1017
01:09:07,511 --> 01:09:09,376
I don't understand.

1018
01:09:09,413 --> 01:09:12,405
Who kills Prince Humperdinck at the end?

1019
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:14,418
Somebody's got to do it.

1020
01:09:14,452 --> 01:09:15,783
Is it Inigo? Who?

1021
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:18,914
Nobody. Nobody kills him.

1022
01:09:18,956 --> 01:09:20,321
He lives.

1023
01:09:20,358 --> 01:09:21,950
You mean he wins?

1024
01:09:21,993 --> 01:09:25,190
Jesus, Grandpa, what did you read me this thing for?

1025
01:09:25,229 --> 01:09:26,958
You've been very sick...

1026
01:09:26,998 --> 01:09:30,456
and you're taking this story very seriously.

1027
01:09:30,501 --> 01:09:33,470
I think we ought to stop now.

1028
01:09:33,504 --> 01:09:35,529
No. I'm OK.

1029
01:09:35,573 --> 01:09:38,440
Sit down. I'm all right.

1030
01:09:39,977 --> 01:09:43,208
All right, now, let's see, where were we?

1031
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:47,941
In the Pit of Despair.

1032
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:54,419
We Montoyas have never taken defeat easily.

1033
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:57,018
Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.

1034
01:09:57,061 --> 01:09:58,585
The body?

1035
01:09:58,629 --> 01:10:00,392
Have you any money?

1036
01:10:00,431 --> 01:10:01,728
I have a little.

1037
01:10:01,766 --> 01:10:05,827
I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all.

1038
01:10:09,974 --> 01:10:11,635
Go away!

1039
01:10:14,779 --> 01:10:16,212
What? What?

1040
01:10:16,247 --> 01:10:17,373
Are you the Miracle Max...

1041
01:10:17,415 --> 01:10:19,144
who worked for the king all those years?

1042
01:10:19,183 --> 01:10:20,980
The king's stinking son fired me.

1043
01:10:21,018 --> 01:10:24,010
And thank you for bringing up such a painful subject.

1044
01:10:24,055 --> 01:10:26,046
While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut...

1045
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:27,387
and pour lemon juice on it?

1046
01:10:27,425 --> 01:10:28,585
We're closed!

1047
01:10:32,363 --> 01:10:34,092
Beat it, or I'll call the brute squad.

1048
01:10:34,131 --> 01:10:35,564
I'm on the brute squad.

1049
01:10:35,599 --> 01:10:37,260
You are the brute squad.

1050
01:10:37,301 --> 01:10:39,599
We need a miracle. It's very important.

1051
01:10:39,637 --> 01:10:41,764
Look, I'm retired. And besides...

1052
01:10:41,806 --> 01:10:44,297
why would you want someone the king's stinking son fired?

1053
01:10:44,342 --> 01:10:46,537
I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.

1054
01:10:46,577 --> 01:10:47,942
He's already dead.

1055
01:10:47,979 --> 01:10:49,503
He is, huh?

1056
01:10:49,547 --> 01:10:52,345
I'll take a look. Bring him in.

1057
01:11:05,563 --> 01:11:07,554
I've seen worse.

1058
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:14,230
Sir?

1059
01:11:16,907 --> 01:11:18,966
We're in a terrible rush.

1060
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:20,136
Don't rush me, sonny.

1061
01:11:20,177 --> 01:11:22,543
You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles.

1062
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:24,070
You got money?

1063
01:11:24,115 --> 01:11:25,309
Sixty-five.

1064
01:11:25,349 --> 01:11:28,045
I never worked for so little...

1065
01:11:28,085 --> 01:11:30,821
except once, and that was a very noble cause.

1066
01:11:30,821 --> 01:11:33,051
This is noble, sir.

1067
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:35,081
His wife is crippled.

1068
01:11:35,126 --> 01:11:39,859
His children are on the brink of starvation.

1069
01:11:39,897 --> 01:11:42,229
Are you a rotten liar!

1070
01:11:42,266 --> 01:11:44,427
I need him to help avenge my father...

1071
01:11:44,468 --> 01:11:46,163
murdered these twenty years.

1072
01:11:46,203 --> 01:11:48,967
Your first story was better. Where's that bellows?

1073
01:11:49,006 --> 01:11:52,271
He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.

1074
01:11:52,309 --> 01:11:53,901
He's dead. He can't talk.

1075
01:11:53,944 --> 01:11:56,572
Look who knows so much, huh?

1076
01:11:56,614 --> 01:12:01,574
It just so happens your friend is only mostly dead.

1077
01:12:01,619 --> 01:12:05,521
There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead.

1078
01:12:05,556 --> 01:12:07,251
Please open his mouth.

1079
01:12:07,291 --> 01:12:12,092
Now, mostly dead is slightly alive.

1080
01:12:12,129 --> 01:12:14,723
Now, all dead... well, with all dead...

1081
01:12:14,765 --> 01:12:17,359
there's usually only one thing that you can do.

1082
01:12:17,401 --> 01:12:18,766
What's that?

1083
01:12:18,803 --> 01:12:21,636
Go through his clothes and look for loose change.

1084
01:12:28,212 --> 01:12:30,112
Hello in there!

1085
01:12:30,147 --> 01:12:32,615
What's so important?

1086
01:12:32,650 --> 01:12:35,585
What you got here that's worth living for?

1087
01:12:40,091 --> 01:12:42,559
Tr-u-u-ue lo-o-o-ove.

1088
01:12:42,593 --> 01:12:44,527
True love. You heard him?

1089
01:12:44,562 --> 01:12:46,723
You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.

1090
01:12:46,764 --> 01:12:48,061
Hey, sonny...

1091
01:12:48,099 --> 01:12:50,090
true love is the greatest thing in the world...

1092
01:12:50,134 --> 01:12:52,432
except for a nice M.L. T...

1093
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:54,097
mutton, lettuce, and tomato sandwich...

1094
01:12:54,138 --> 01:12:58,006
when the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe.

1095
01:12:58,042 --> 01:12:59,407
They're so perky. I love that.

1096
01:12:59,443 --> 01:13:00,671
But that's not what he said.

1097
01:13:00,711 --> 01:13:03,578
He distinctly said, ''To bl-a-a-ave.''

1098
01:13:03,614 --> 01:13:06,139
And as we all know, to blave means to bluff, huh?

1099
01:13:06,183 --> 01:13:08,651
So you were probably playing cards, and he cheated...

1100
01:13:08,686 --> 01:13:11,985
Liar!

1101
01:13:12,022 --> 01:13:13,148
Get back, witch!

1102
01:13:13,190 --> 01:13:14,623
I'm not a witch! I'm your wife!

1103
01:13:14,658 --> 01:13:16,125
But after what you just said...

1104
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:18,424
I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore!

1105
01:13:18,462 --> 01:13:19,952
You never had it so good.

1106
01:13:19,997 --> 01:13:21,430
He said true love, Max.

1107
01:13:21,465 --> 01:13:22,796
Don't say another word, Valerie!

1108
01:13:22,833 --> 01:13:23,959
He's afraid.

1109
01:13:24,001 --> 01:13:25,662
Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him...

1110
01:13:25,703 --> 01:13:26,965
his confidence is shattered.

1111
01:13:27,004 --> 01:13:28,164
Why'd you say that name?

1112
01:13:28,205 --> 01:13:30,264
You promised me that you would never say that name!

1113
01:13:30,307 --> 01:13:32,639
What? Humperdinck?

1114
01:13:36,313 --> 01:13:37,905
I'm not listening!

1115
01:13:37,948 --> 01:13:39,438
A life expiring...

1116
01:13:39,483 --> 01:13:42,111
and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help!

1117
01:13:42,153 --> 01:13:44,621
- Nobody's hearing nothing! - Humperdinck!

1118
01:13:44,655 --> 01:13:46,589
This is Buttercup's true love.

1119
01:13:46,624 --> 01:13:49,320
If you heal him, he will stop Humperdinck's wedding.

1120
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,385
Shut up! Wait a minute.

1121
01:13:51,428 --> 01:13:53,419
I make him better, Humperdinck suffers?

1122
01:13:53,464 --> 01:13:56,228
Humiliations galore!

1123
01:13:59,803 --> 01:14:01,327
That is a noble cause.

1124
01:14:01,372 --> 01:14:04,307
Give me the sixty-five. I'm on the job.

1125
01:14:07,978 --> 01:14:09,809
That's a miracle pill?

1126
01:14:09,847 --> 01:14:12,577
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier...

1127
01:14:12,650 --> 01:14:15,949
but you have to wait 15 minutes for full potency...

1128
01:14:15,986 --> 01:14:19,183
and you shouldn't go swimming for at least, what?

1129
01:14:19,223 --> 01:14:21,691
- An hour. A good hour. - Yeah, an hour.

1130
01:14:21,725 --> 01:14:23,454
Thank you for everything.

1131
01:14:23,494 --> 01:14:24,859
Bye-bye, boys.

1132
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:26,863
Have fun storming the castle.

1133
01:14:26,897 --> 01:14:28,364
Think it'll work?

1134
01:14:28,399 --> 01:14:30,094
It would take a miracle.

1135
01:14:39,944 --> 01:14:41,104
Anything?

1136
01:14:43,514 --> 01:14:46,642
Inigo, there's more than thirty.

1137
01:14:46,684 --> 01:14:48,982
What's the difference?

1138
01:14:49,019 --> 01:14:50,987
We've got him.

1139
01:14:51,021 --> 01:14:52,545
Help me here.

1140
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:54,683
We'll have to force-feed him.

1141
01:14:54,725 --> 01:14:56,215
Has it been fifteen minutes?

1142
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:58,490
We can't wait. The wedding's in half an hour.

1143
01:14:58,529 --> 01:15:01,089
We must strike in the hustle and bustle beforehand.

1144
01:15:01,131 --> 01:15:02,496
Tilt his head back.

1145
01:15:02,533 --> 01:15:05,331
Open his mouth.

1146
01:15:08,839 --> 01:15:11,069
How long do we have to wait...

1147
01:15:11,108 --> 01:15:12,803
before if we know the miracle works?

1148
01:15:12,843 --> 01:15:14,504
Your guess is as good as mine.

1149
01:15:14,545 --> 01:15:16,979
I'll beat you apart! I'll take you both together!

1150
01:15:17,014 --> 01:15:18,948
I guess not very long.

1151
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:22,041
Why won't my arms move?

1152
01:15:22,086 --> 01:15:23,951
You've been mostly dead all day.

1153
01:15:23,988 --> 01:15:27,719
We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.

1154
01:15:27,758 --> 01:15:29,560
Who are you?

1155
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,891
Are we enemies?

1156
01:15:30,961 --> 01:15:32,519
Why am I on this wall?

1157
01:15:32,563 --> 01:15:33,894
Where's Buttercup?

1158
01:15:33,931 --> 01:15:35,262
Let me explain.

1159
01:15:35,299 --> 01:15:37,290
No, there is too much. Let me sum up.

1160
01:15:37,334 --> 01:15:40,098
Buttercup's marrying Humperdinck in less than half an hour...

1161
01:15:40,137 --> 01:15:42,765
so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding...

1162
01:15:42,806 --> 01:15:44,535
steal the princess, make our escape...

1163
01:15:44,575 --> 01:15:46,406
after I kill Count Rugen.

1164
01:15:46,443 --> 01:15:48,502
That doesn't leave much time for dilly-dallying.

1165
01:15:48,545 --> 01:15:50,706
You just wiggled your finger!

1166
01:15:50,748 --> 01:15:52,238
That's wonderful!

1167
01:15:52,283 --> 01:15:53,944
I've always been a quick healer.

1168
01:15:53,984 --> 01:15:55,246
What are our liabilities?

1169
01:15:55,286 --> 01:15:57,618
There is but one working castle gate.

1170
01:15:57,655 --> 01:15:58,883
Come on.

1171
01:16:00,591 --> 01:16:04,755
And it is guarded by sixty men.

1172
01:16:04,795 --> 01:16:06,262
And our assets?

1173
01:16:06,297 --> 01:16:08,788
Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.

1174
01:16:08,832 --> 01:16:10,231
That's it?

1175
01:16:10,267 --> 01:16:11,564
Lmpossible.

1176
01:16:11,602 --> 01:16:13,570
If I had a month to plan...

1177
01:16:13,604 --> 01:16:15,902
maybe I could come up with something, but this...

1178
01:16:15,939 --> 01:16:17,634
You just shook your head!

1179
01:16:17,675 --> 01:16:19,404
That doesn't make you happy?

1180
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:24,743
My brains, his steel...

1181
01:16:24,782 --> 01:16:26,807
and your strength against sixty men...

1182
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:30,342
and a little head jiggle is supposed to make me happy?

1183
01:16:31,555 --> 01:16:35,218
If we only had a wheelbarrow, that would be something.

1184
01:16:35,259 --> 01:16:37,659
Where did we put the wheelbarrow the albino had?

1185
01:16:37,695 --> 01:16:39,390
Over the albino, I think.

1186
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:43,560
Why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place?

1187
01:16:45,235 --> 01:16:47,328
What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.

1188
01:16:47,371 --> 01:16:49,032
There we cannot help you.

1189
01:16:50,107 --> 01:16:51,631
Will this do?

1190
01:16:51,675 --> 01:16:54,166
- Where did you get that? - At Miracle Max's.

1191
01:16:54,211 --> 01:16:56,441
It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.

1192
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,744
All right. Come on, help me up.

1193
01:17:01,185 --> 01:17:02,675
I'll need a sword eventually.

1194
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,585
Why? You can't even lift one.

1195
01:17:04,621 --> 01:17:07,112
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?

1196
01:17:07,157 --> 01:17:08,590
Thank you.

1197
01:17:08,625 --> 01:17:11,594
There may be problems once we're inside.

1198
01:17:11,628 --> 01:17:14,324
I'll say. How do I find the count?

1199
01:17:14,365 --> 01:17:15,730
Once I do, how do I find you again?

1200
01:17:15,766 --> 01:17:17,131
Once I find you again, how do we escape?

1201
01:17:17,167 --> 01:17:18,600
Don't pester him.

1202
01:17:18,635 --> 01:17:20,830
He's had a hard day.

1203
01:17:20,871 --> 01:17:23,135
Right, right. Sorry.

1204
01:17:26,910 --> 01:17:29,105
- Inigo. - What?

1205
01:17:29,146 --> 01:17:31,114
I hope we win.

1206
01:17:31,148 --> 01:17:34,117
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.

1207
01:17:34,151 --> 01:17:35,550
Should I be?

1208
01:17:35,586 --> 01:17:38,555
Brides often are, I'm told.

1209
01:17:38,589 --> 01:17:40,454
I do not marry tonight.

1210
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:43,590
My Westley will save me.

1211
01:18:36,113 --> 01:18:38,081
Marriage...

1212
01:18:38,115 --> 01:18:43,644
Marriage is what brings us together... today.

1213
01:18:43,687 --> 01:18:45,086
Marriage...

1214
01:18:45,122 --> 01:18:48,489
that blessed arrangement...

1215
01:18:48,525 --> 01:18:53,019
that dream within a dream...

1216
01:18:53,063 --> 01:18:54,360
Stand your ground, men!

1217
01:19:03,273 --> 01:19:07,300
I am the Dread Pirate Roberts.

1218
01:19:08,612 --> 01:19:12,013
There will be no survivor!

1219
01:19:12,049 --> 01:19:14,108
- Now? - Not yet.

1220
01:19:14,151 --> 01:19:16,312
My men are here.

1221
01:19:16,353 --> 01:19:18,844
I am here...

1222
01:19:18,889 --> 01:19:22,825
but soon you will not be here.

1223
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:24,691
- Now? - Light him.

1224
01:19:27,698 --> 01:19:29,791
The Dread Pirate Roberts...

1225
01:19:29,833 --> 01:19:32,666
takes no survivors.

1226
01:19:32,703 --> 01:19:35,570
All your worst nightmares...

1227
01:19:35,606 --> 01:19:38,837
are about to come true.

1228
01:19:38,876 --> 01:19:40,867
Then love...

1229
01:19:40,911 --> 01:19:43,402
true love...

1230
01:19:43,447 --> 01:19:45,608
will follow you...

1231
01:19:45,649 --> 01:19:48,174
forever.

1232
01:19:48,218 --> 01:19:50,948
The Dread Pirate Roberts...

1233
01:19:50,988 --> 01:19:54,981
is here for your souls!

1234
01:19:56,727 --> 01:19:58,217
Stay where you are!

1235
01:19:58,262 --> 01:20:00,230
Fight!

1236
01:20:00,264 --> 01:20:02,755
Stay where you are!

1237
01:20:06,703 --> 01:20:09,228
So treasure your love.

1238
01:20:09,273 --> 01:20:11,070
Skip to the end.

1239
01:20:11,108 --> 01:20:13,201
Have you the ring?

1240
01:20:14,778 --> 01:20:16,837
Here comes my Westley now.

1241
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,576
Fezzik, the portcullis!

1242
01:20:24,721 --> 01:20:27,053
Your Westley is dead.

1243
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:28,387
I killed him myself.

1244
01:20:28,425 --> 01:20:31,155
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?

1245
01:20:35,198 --> 01:20:36,961
Give us the gate key.

1246
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,059
I have no gate key.

1247
01:20:39,102 --> 01:20:41,730
Fezzik, tear his arms off.

1248
01:20:41,772 --> 01:20:44,741
You mean this gate key?

1249
01:20:44,775 --> 01:20:47,710
...and do you, Princess Buttercup...

1250
01:20:47,744 --> 01:20:50,736
Man and wife! Say man and wife!

1251
01:20:50,781 --> 01:20:52,772
Man and wife.

1252
01:20:52,816 --> 01:20:55,046
Escort the bride to the honeymoon suite.

1253
01:20:55,085 --> 01:20:57,849
I'll be there shortly.

1254
01:20:58,922 --> 01:21:00,856
He didn't come.

1255
01:21:34,691 --> 01:21:37,023
Kill the dark one and the giant...

1256
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:39,358
but leave the third for questioning.

1257
01:21:52,009 --> 01:21:54,876
My name is Inigo Montoya.

1258
01:21:54,911 --> 01:21:57,402
You killed my father.

1259
01:21:57,481 --> 01:21:59,949
Prepare to die.

1260
01:22:24,608 --> 01:22:26,075
I need you!

1261
01:22:26,109 --> 01:22:28,373
I can't leave him alone.

1262
01:22:28,412 --> 01:22:30,539
He's getting away from me, Fezzik!

1263
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:31,911
Please!

1264
01:22:37,154 --> 01:22:39,145
I'll be right back.

1265
01:22:46,663 --> 01:22:48,130
Thank you.

1266
01:22:49,232 --> 01:22:51,132
Strange wedding.

1267
01:22:51,168 --> 01:22:54,604
Yes... a very strange wedding.

1268
01:22:54,671 --> 01:22:56,161
Come along.

1269
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:04,071
What was that for?

1270
01:23:04,114 --> 01:23:06,480
Because you've always been so kind to me.

1271
01:23:06,516 --> 01:23:08,484
And I won't be seeing you again...

1272
01:23:08,552 --> 01:23:11,521
since I'm killing myself once we reach the honeymoon suite.

1273
01:23:11,555 --> 01:23:13,682
Won't that be nice?

1274
01:23:13,724 --> 01:23:15,191
She kissed me!

1275
01:24:02,105 --> 01:24:04,573
Sorry, Father.

1276
01:24:05,742 --> 01:24:08,040
I tried.

1277
01:24:10,947 --> 01:24:13,006
You must be that little Spanish brat...

1278
01:24:13,083 --> 01:24:16,519
I taught a lesson to all those years ago.

1279
01:24:16,586 --> 01:24:18,554
Simply incredible.

1280
01:24:18,588 --> 01:24:20,579
Have you been chasing me your whole life...

1281
01:24:20,624 --> 01:24:22,558
only to fail now?

1282
01:24:22,592 --> 01:24:25,755
I think that's the worst thing I've ever heard.

1283
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:29,095
How marvelous.

1284
01:25:06,236 --> 01:25:08,204
There's a shortage of perfect breasts in this world.

1285
01:25:08,238 --> 01:25:11,173
It would be a pity to damage yours.

1286
01:25:12,609 --> 01:25:14,201
Oh, Westley, darling!

1287
01:25:17,247 --> 01:25:20,080
Westley, why won't you hold me?

1288
01:25:20,116 --> 01:25:21,208
Gently.

1289
01:25:21,284 --> 01:25:23,252
At a time like this...

1290
01:25:23,286 --> 01:25:26,255
that's all you can think to say, gently?

1291
01:25:26,289 --> 01:25:28,280
Gently!

1292
01:25:41,137 --> 01:25:45,198
Good heavens, are you still trying to win?

1293
01:25:47,444 --> 01:25:51,346
You've got an overdeveloped sense of vengeance.

1294
01:25:51,381 --> 01:25:54,350
It's going to get you into trouble someday.

1295
01:26:09,032 --> 01:26:11,796
My name is Inigo Montoya.

1296
01:26:11,835 --> 01:26:14,702
You killed my father.

1297
01:26:14,738 --> 01:26:16,205
Prepare to die.

1298
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:26,681
My name is Inigo Montoya.

1299
01:26:26,716 --> 01:26:28,809
You killed my father.

1300
01:26:28,885 --> 01:26:30,716
Prepare to die.

1301
01:26:34,291 --> 01:26:37,089
Hello! My name is Inigo Montoya.

1302
01:26:37,127 --> 01:26:40,096
You killed my father. Prepare to die.

1303
01:26:40,130 --> 01:26:42,223
Stop saying that!

1304
01:26:46,236 --> 01:26:48,170
Hello! My name is Inigo Montoya!

1305
01:26:48,204 --> 01:26:50,069
You killed my father!

1306
01:26:50,106 --> 01:26:51,801
Prepare to die!

1307
01:26:51,841 --> 01:26:53,206
Offer me money.

1308
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:56,075
Power, too, promise me that.

1309
01:26:56,112 --> 01:26:59,104
All that I have and more, please.

1310
01:26:59,149 --> 01:27:02,016
Offer me everything I ask for.

1311
01:27:02,052 --> 01:27:04,111
Anything you want.

1312
01:27:06,289 --> 01:27:09,816
I want my father back, you son of a bitch!

1313
01:27:24,007 --> 01:27:26,076
Westley, will you ever forgive me?

1314
01:27:26,076 --> 01:27:28,738
What hideous sin have you committed lately?

1315
01:27:28,778 --> 01:27:32,441
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.

1316
01:27:32,482 --> 01:27:35,280
It never happened. It never happened.

1317
01:27:35,318 --> 01:27:36,649
But it did. I was there.

1318
01:27:36,686 --> 01:27:38,119
This old man said man and wife.

1319
01:27:38,154 --> 01:27:39,883
Did you say I do?

1320
01:27:42,726 --> 01:27:43,954
We sort of skipped that part.

1321
01:27:43,994 --> 01:27:45,461
Then you're not married.

1322
01:27:45,495 --> 01:27:49,591
If you didn't say it, you didn't do it.

1323
01:27:49,632 --> 01:27:52,226
Wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?

1324
01:27:52,268 --> 01:27:55,829
A technicality that will shortly be remedied.

1325
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:59,672
But first things first.

1326
01:28:01,111 --> 01:28:02,601
To the death.

1327
01:28:04,014 --> 01:28:05,572
To the pain.

1328
01:28:07,484 --> 01:28:09,145
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.

1329
01:28:09,185 --> 01:28:10,846
I'll explain...

1330
01:28:10,887 --> 01:28:14,653
and I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand...

1331
01:28:14,691 --> 01:28:16,852
you warthog-faced buffoon.

1332
01:28:18,194 --> 01:28:20,662
That may be the first time in my life...

1333
01:28:20,697 --> 01:28:23,359
a man has dared insult me.

1334
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:25,061
It won't be the last.

1335
01:28:25,101 --> 01:28:27,569
To the pain means the first thing you lose...

1336
01:28:27,604 --> 01:28:29,629
will be your feet below the ankles...

1337
01:28:29,672 --> 01:28:32,140
then your hands at the wrists...

1338
01:28:32,175 --> 01:28:33,642
next your nose.

1339
01:28:33,676 --> 01:28:35,644
And then my tongue, I suppose.

1340
01:28:35,678 --> 01:28:38,146
I killed you too quickly the last time...

1341
01:28:38,181 --> 01:28:40,513
a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.

1342
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:42,040
I wasn't finished.

1343
01:28:42,118 --> 01:28:45,053
The next thing you lose will be your left eye, then your right.

1344
01:28:45,088 --> 01:28:48,489
And then my ears. I understand! Let's get on with it!

1345
01:28:48,525 --> 01:28:51,858
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why...

1346
01:28:53,797 --> 01:28:57,130
so every shriek of every child at seeing your hideousness...

1347
01:28:57,167 --> 01:28:59,101
will be yours to cherish.

1348
01:28:59,135 --> 01:29:01,831
Every babe that weeps at your approach...

1349
01:29:01,871 --> 01:29:05,272
every woman who cries out, ''God, what is that thing''...

1350
01:29:05,308 --> 01:29:08,106
will echo in your perfect ears.

1351
01:29:08,144 --> 01:29:11,113
That is what ''to the pain'' means.

1352
01:29:11,147 --> 01:29:14,116
It means I leave you in anguish...

1353
01:29:14,150 --> 01:29:17,608
wallowing in freakish misery forever.

1354
01:29:18,655 --> 01:29:20,748
I think you're bluffing.

1355
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:22,223
It's possible, pig!

1356
01:29:22,258 --> 01:29:24,226
I might be bluffing.

1357
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:27,991
It's conceivable, you miserable vomitous mass...

1358
01:29:28,031 --> 01:29:31,626
I'm only lying here because I lack the strength to stand.

1359
01:29:31,668 --> 01:29:33,761
Then again...

1360
01:29:35,105 --> 01:29:38,074
perhaps I have the strength after all.

1361
01:29:53,723 --> 01:29:57,853
Drop your sword.

1362
01:30:01,097 --> 01:30:02,860
Have a seat.

1363
01:30:07,303 --> 01:30:08,770
Tie him up.

1364
01:30:09,939 --> 01:30:12,772
Make it as tight as you like.

1365
01:30:16,779 --> 01:30:18,246
Where's Fezzik?

1366
01:30:18,281 --> 01:30:20,841
I thought he was with you.

1367
01:30:20,884 --> 01:30:22,613
In that case...

1368
01:30:22,652 --> 01:30:23,778
Help him.

1369
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:25,720
Why does Westley need helping?

1370
01:30:25,755 --> 01:30:28,121
Because he has no strength.

1371
01:30:28,158 --> 01:30:30,183
I knew you were bluffing! I knew he was bluffing.

1372
01:30:30,226 --> 01:30:32,956
- Shall I dispatch him for you? - Thank you, but no.

1373
01:30:32,996 --> 01:30:34,293
Whatever happens to us...

1374
01:30:34,330 --> 01:30:36,457
I want him to live a long life, alone with his cowardice.

1375
01:30:38,401 --> 01:30:42,201
Inigo, where are you?

1376
01:30:42,238 --> 01:30:45,105
There you are.

1377
01:30:45,141 --> 01:30:47,735
Inigo, I saw the prince's stables...

1378
01:30:47,777 --> 01:30:50,905
and there they were, four white horses.

1379
01:30:50,947 --> 01:30:53,245
And I thought, there are four of us...

1380
01:30:53,283 --> 01:30:55,251
if we ever find the lady.

1381
01:30:55,285 --> 01:30:56,684
Hello, lady.

1382
01:30:58,188 --> 01:31:01,589
So I took them with me in case we ever bumped into each other.

1383
01:31:01,624 --> 01:31:04,058
I guess we just did.

1384
01:31:05,295 --> 01:31:07,263
You did something right.

1385
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:10,390
Don't worry. I won't let it go to my head.

1386
01:31:29,285 --> 01:31:30,752
You know...

1387
01:31:30,787 --> 01:31:32,755
it's very strange.

1388
01:31:32,789 --> 01:31:36,281
I have been in the revenge business so long...

1389
01:31:36,326 --> 01:31:38,294
now that it's over...

1390
01:31:38,328 --> 01:31:41,320
I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.

1391
01:31:42,332 --> 01:31:44,630
Have you ever considered piracy?

1392
01:31:44,667 --> 01:31:46,897
You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.

1393
01:31:59,515 --> 01:32:01,107
They rode to freedom.

1394
01:32:01,150 --> 01:32:04,779
And as dawn arose, Westley and Buttercup knew they were safe.

1395
01:32:04,821 --> 01:32:07,949
A wave of love swept over them.

1396
01:32:07,991 --> 01:32:10,721
And as they reached for each other...

1397
01:32:12,829 --> 01:32:14,296
What? What?

1398
01:32:14,330 --> 01:32:17,527
It's kissing again. You don't want to hear that.

1399
01:32:17,567 --> 01:32:21,094
I don't mind so much.

1400
01:32:25,808 --> 01:32:27,833
Since the invention of the kiss...

1401
01:32:27,877 --> 01:32:29,538
there have been five kisses...

1402
01:32:29,579 --> 01:32:31,308
that were rated the most passionate...

1403
01:32:31,347 --> 01:32:33,315
the most pure.

1404
01:32:33,349 --> 01:32:35,783
This one left them all behind.

1405
01:32:40,256 --> 01:32:41,780
The end.

1406
01:32:44,861 --> 01:32:47,329
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.

1407
01:32:59,809 --> 01:33:01,777
All right.

1408
01:33:04,781 --> 01:33:06,248
So long.

1409
01:33:07,850 --> 01:33:09,215
Grandpa...

1410
01:33:11,688 --> 01:33:14,156
maybe you could come over...

1411
01:33:14,223 --> 01:33:16,919
and read it again to me tomorrow.

1412
01:33:18,628 --> 01:33:20,926
As you wish.
