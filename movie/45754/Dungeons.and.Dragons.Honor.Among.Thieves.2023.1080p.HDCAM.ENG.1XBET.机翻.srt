and we only rob from those who feel it believes

128
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:28,400

00:11:54,466 --> 00:11:55,266
有一个
there was a

141
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,900
觉醒石碑
tablet of re awakening

142
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,800
能够让一个死去的人复活
capable of bringing back a single deceased person

143
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,800
即使被红巫师之刃杀死
even when killed by a red wizards blade

144
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:05,333
你可能会看到这是怎么回事
you can probably see where this is going

145
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,766
为什么我不能来
why can't i come

146
00:12:06,766 --> 00:12:09,000
抱歉治愈这个太危险了
sorry cure this one is too dangerous

147
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,600
那你不应该去
then you shouldn't go

148
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,066
我们有我们需要的一切
we have everything that we need

149
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:16,066
哦 是的 看这是最后一个
oh yeah look this is the last one

150
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,133
相信我
trust me

151
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:24,366
你知道吗
you know what

152
00:12:24,766 --> 00:12:25,766
你马上回来
you right back

153
00:12:25,866 --> 00:12:27,500
我没有告诉她毛巾的事
i didn't tell her about the towel to

154
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,733
如果一切都消失了 让她心碎
break her heart if it all went to shed and

155
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:32,366
呃摆脱它去了
uh to shed it went

156
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:47,366
她得到了时光荏苒的父母钻石
she's got the times gone parents diamonds

157
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,333
加倍并保持安全
double and keep care of safe

158
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:06,166
你有我的工作
you have my work

159
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,466
判我再判两年或 20 年的房子的话
house words who sentence me to another two years or 20

160
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,500
就此而言
for that matter it

161
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,700
永远不会受到足够的惩罚
would never be punishment enough for the

162
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,466
我犯下的最严重的罪行
worst crime i ever committed

163
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,933
抢夺我女儿的父亲
robbing my daughter of her father

164
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,766
但要知道如果你真的选择释放我
but know that if you do choose to free me

165
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,333
用我余下的时间努力写错
spend the rest of my days trying to write that wrong

166
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:42,266
任何你想要的
anything you want that

167
00:14:42,866 --> 00:14:43,666
我很好
i'm good

168
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,400
在你宣布你的决定之前 我恳求你取悦
before you announce your decision i implore you to please

169
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:54,700
等着你
wait for you

170
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,500
我不能告诉你我必须走开
i can't tell you i'll have to step away

171
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,900
她在画土豆
she's drawing potatoes

172
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:54,100
还在呼吸
still breathing

173
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,566
哈哈哈哈
hahahaha

174
00:17:08,466 --> 00:17:09,666
空了一会儿
empty for a while

175
00:17:26,466 --> 00:17:27,933
你认为 Forge 把她带到哪里去了
where do you think forge took her

176
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,300
我不能在像城市一样画画的短教练中出现
i can't seem in a short coach who draws like cities

177
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,966
一些晚餐你和你的妻子

与那个
be with that

180
00:17:37,866 --> 00:17:39,900
那些嘴唇在微风中生长
those lips grows just the breeze

181
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,966
所以我们对鲍德之门进行投票
so we take a vote down to balder's gate

182
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,266
然后往北走
and then head north

183
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,000
好吧 我们正在寻找草料 我们会在拜访时付钱给马洛
well we're looking for forage we'll pay marlow in a visit

184
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:54,866
你确定你真的想让自己经历那什么
you sure do you really want to put yourself through that what

185
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,600
如果他不想和你说话
if he doesn't want to talk to you

186
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,500
这与他想要什么无关 而与关闭有关
it's not about what he wants it's about closure

187
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,000
他说
he say

188
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,600
他会让她说他不再是你的丈夫了
he will let her say he wasn't your husband anymore was that

189
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:05,266
关闭
closure

190
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:06,966
你不会明白我不

我清楚地清楚地不

192
00:18:14,066 --> 00:18:14,866
就是它

193
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,166
王八蛋
son of a bitch

00:18:18,466 --> 00:18:20,966
Forge is lord 永远不会过冬
forge is lord never winter

195
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,366
那个小丑是怎么做到的
how did that clown pull that off

196
00:18:24,866 --> 00:18:27,100
只要他得到治愈 我不在乎拜托
as long as he's got cure i don't care come on

197
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:28,466
我们走吧

谢谢妈妈我的嘴唇

很多人喜欢我的嘴唇

从未见过这个肮脏的地方

202
00:19:07,966 --> 00:19:10,200
一定要参加烈日运动会

203
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:13,500
哦 在他们被取缔之前 我爸爸带我去了最后一个
oh my dad took me to last one before they were outlawed

你为什么对我生气

一个有秘密的红色渔夫

243
00:21:27,466 --> 00:21:28,266
哈哈哈

你好回来

255
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,500
好吧 这是令人毛骨悚然的
well that's bristering

256
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:01,066
又热又热
bristeringly hot and yet again

257
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,533
卡罗尔 我们真的应该和厨房工作人员谈谈
Carol we really should speak to the kitchen staff

258
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:06,266
因为很明显没必要这么热
because there's a clear no need for it to be this hot

259
00:22:06,733 --> 00:22:10,100
是的是的是的 所以你是贝弗冬天的领主吗？
yeah yeah the the t side so how are you the lord of bever winter

260
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,800
就在你入狱之前
right before you went off to prison

261
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,600
你向我收取了装备费用
you charged me with gear as well being

262
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,600
当时没想太多
didn't think much of it at the time

263
00:22:17,766 --> 00:22:20,766
但有一刻我看着她的眼睛
but there came a moment when i looked into her eyes

264
00:22:20,766 --> 00:22:23,100
我突然知道我必须成为一个更好的人
and i suddenly knew i had to be a better man

265
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,600
显然我不能用石头把宝物还回去
obviously i couldn't give back the treasures with stone

266
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:30,166
所以当大人永远不会失败时 我会抓住机会尝试
so when lord never Ember fail ill i'll seize the chance to try

267
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:31,700
并有所作为
and make a difference

268
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,600
警卫的钱远离我的竞选活动
and the money from guards keep paved away from my campaign

269
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,100
但我会告诉你这个
but i will tell you this

270
00:22:36,866 --> 00:22:38,133
一个人做不到
couldn't have done it alone

271
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,366
她在那里
and there she is

272
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,266
你记得萨芬娜
you remember safina

273
00:22:42,966 --> 00:22:45,866
你还在和她一起工作是她让我们被抓住了
you're still working with her she's the one that got us caught

274
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:48,066
不是真的 没有我们所有人

275
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,200
会被抓住的

当他失去你母亲时
when he lost your mother

386

谁会迷失自我

387
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:04,700
他为什么要谎报第一名
why did he lie about the top one

388
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,000
也许他羞于承认这么久以来他放弃了多少
maybe he was ashamed to admit how much he'd given up for so long

用箭杀死了我的女儿 不 不是
killing my daughter with an arrow no it's not

team who's gonna help us out we have nothing to pay them with

412
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:27,500
伪造确实
forge does

413
00:30:27,866 --> 00:30:28,733
他说最富有的
he said the richest

414
00:30:28,733 --> 00:30:30,500
人们前来为烈日游戏下注

治愈会消失
the cure will go

419
00:30:36,733 --> 00:30:38,766
我们出于正当理由抛弃了她
we abandon her for the right reason

420
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:42,066
我知道我不会那样说

我们为这个团队得到了什么
what do we get for this team

423
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:49,466
你知道我想知道 Simon 是否还在 triborn
you know i wonder if Simon's still in triborn

424
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:51,700
西蒙是个糟糕的帽子来源
Simon's a terrible source of hat

425
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:53,966
看来两年后我相信他会变得更好
it seemed in two years i'm sure he's got the better

426
00:30:55,366 --> 00:30:58,466
没有人能对这一把戏望尘莫及
no one can hold a candle to this trick

427
00:31:03,266 --> 00:31:04,300
这个怎么样
how about this one

428
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,500
人们喜欢新割草的气味
people like the smell of fresh cut grass

429
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,000
闻到它被刷成十字架
smell that it's brushed a cross

430
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:14,133
为什么五岁
why five year old

431
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:15,266
可以神奇地做到这一点
can do that magically

432
00:31:15,266 --> 00:31:18,900
但你能做到这一点吗
but can you do this absolutely

433
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,866
他没有好转
he hasn't gotten better

434
00:31:23,866 --> 00:31:25,933
我不认为这是关于他在那里做什么
i don't think it's about what he's doing up there

435
00:31:25,933 --> 00:31:28,600
这很难像这样有点模糊
this is quite hard to be slightly blurry like this

436
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:32,000
非常模糊但稍微模糊
to be very blurry but to be slightly blurry

437
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,300
这才是真正的魔法
that's the real magic

438
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:46,966
他在编一些书
he's making up in some books

439
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,400
少它只是东西
less it's only things

440
00:31:48,466 --> 00:31:52,166
他在撒谎 这全是流行游艇 搞定他
it's all pop yacht he's lying get him

441
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,700
我不喜欢这个节目

442
00:32:51,866 --> 00:32:55,466
签名哦上帝留下来尴尬你会没事的
sign oh god staying for an awkward you'll be okay

443
00:33:07,766 --> 00:33:09,666
我本可以想要你的力量来刺
i could have wanted your force to the prick

444
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:10,966
一旦我们离开那个错误
as soon as we left that fault

445
00:33:10,966 --> 00:33:13,133
所以彼得想杀了我只是袖手旁观
so Peter tried to kill me just stood by

446
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,533
你知道这个谣言
you know this rumor

447
00:33:14,533 --> 00:33:16,000
她让上帝永远不会跌倒
she made lord never have a fall

448
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,500
生病与董事会扫清道路
ill to clear the way with the board

449
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:19,733
魔法在一个我不知道的洞里
magic is on a hole i Don't know

450
00:33:19,866 --> 00:33:22,100
我卖空了自己 我很抱歉你的表演
i'm selling yourself short i'm sorry your show

451
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,933
是的 你可以用刚割过的草来打她
yeah you can hit her with that fresh cut grass trip

452
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,866
是的 看起来很有趣
yeah it's funny look

453
00:33:26,866 --> 00:33:28,866
我不怪你想救基拉
i Don't blame you for wanting to save Kira

454
00:33:28,866 --> 00:33:31,466
我喜欢敲前办公室鲈鱼的想法
and i love the idea of knocking forward office perch

455
00:33:31,466 --> 00:33:32,066
但

456
00:33:32,066 --> 00:33:35,800
抢劫卡森永远不会消除抢劫观众的风险
robbing Carson never isn't wipe the risk robbing your audiences

457
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,766
你绝望了吗

458
00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:42,366
我本来打算今晚睡在剧院里 但现在
i was planning on sleeping in the theater tonight but now

459
00:33:42,366 --> 00:33:43,566
这似乎是轻率的
that seems imprudent

460
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,366
所以我们甚至知道什么样的街机
so do we even know what sort of arcade

461
00:33:46,366 --> 00:33:48,000
魔法正在保护这本书
magic is protecting the book

462
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,066
我们会查明你是怎么偷偷过去的
we're gonna find out how you gonna sneak past

463
00:33:50,066 --> 00:33:51,700
整座城堡都看着我
the entire castle watch me

464
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,400
没有画它可能是一个狂野的形状
no drew it may be a wild shape

465
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,700
他们进出并将其检测为

有老鼠或鹿

467
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:03,600
是的 一只鹿很好地融合了城堡里的所有其他鹿
yes a deer well blended all the other deer in the castle

468
00:34:03,766 --> 00:34:04,900
不要标记我

469
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,900
我找到一个德鲁伊

不是你最好的交易

475
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:23,900
谢谢
thank you

476
00:34:26,766 --> 00:34:29,600
以威廉王子堡的名义
in the name of fort prince William

477
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,333
囚犯在这里已经死了

说我们领导人坏话的罪名

粘土上的翡翠永远不会让
the emerald on clay will never let

481
00:34:41,266 --> 00:34:44,600
正义不能因为我的麻烦而被扼杀
justice cannot be killed on my trouble

482
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:45,933
门在这儿

我们需要一只鹿
we need a deer

499
00:36:22,366 --> 00:36:23,366
我们不需要鹿
we don't need a deer

500
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,466
我们要记下幸运的时候
we're gonna take down fortunates when

501
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:33,800
所以我不得不来一杯酒
so i had to come a liquor

502
00:36:33,966 --> 00:36:37,466
我出生于人类决定他们不想要一个爱逗乐的孩子
i was born to humans decided they didn't want a teafling child

503
00:36:38,266 --> 00:36:39,533
另一个带我进去
the one else took me in

504
00:36:39,966 --> 00:36:42,000
享受绣花飞地以保护他们
enjoying the embroide enclave to protect them well

505
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,566
明白这就是你加入我们的全部原因
see that's all the reason you join us

506
00:36:43,566 --> 00:36:46,266
我们是唯一一个看不见城堡的人
we're the only one who get that castle unseen

507
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,700
告诉我们正在做什么

508
00:36:48,133 --> 00:36:51,200
正如你想象的那样 我不相信人类 我发现你是
as you can imagine i don't trust humans i find you to be

509
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,400
仇恨和自私
hateful and selfish

510
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,733
你不会 我是
you won't i'm

511
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,933
发现你是个小男人 如果它有帮助的话 我只是个性感的人
finding you to be a little man if it helps i'm only hot human

512
00:36:58,266 --> 00:37:00,333
但你是个坏巫师不西蒙
but you're a bad sorcerer no Simon

513
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:01,966
他是个强大的巫师
he's a mighty sorcerer

514
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,566
他是 o'more 元素的后代
he's a descendant of elements for o'more

515
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:06,366
成功的唯一方法是
the only way to succeed in this is that

516
00:37:06,366 --> 00:37:07,933
相信它可以做到

517
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:09,900
他没有
he doesn't yeah

518
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:11,266
我想那更好
i suppose that's better

519
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,266
看 西蒙可能没有我的智慧
look Simon may not have my wit

520
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:15,400
或抱直你
or hold you straight

521
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,500
但当它指望这只年轻的手美味时
but when it counts this young hand delicious

522
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,733
这就是为什么约瑟夫
it's why Joseph

523
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,766
他也是你认识的唯一 Socier
he's also the only Socier you know

524
00:37:20,766 --> 00:37:21,600
或者你没有帮助
or you're not helpful

525
00:37:22,933 --> 00:37:24,533
正是你带来的
is it exactly that you bring through this

526
00:37:24,866 --> 00:37:27,500
我是一个你知道的我是一个计划者
me i'm a i'm a planner you know

527
00:37:28,266 --> 00:37:29,266
我制定计划
i make plans

528
00:37:29,933 --> 00:37:32,933
你已经制定了计划那么你现在有什么山谷
you've already made the plan so what valley do you have now

529
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,766
如果计划失败 我会制定新计划
if the plan fails existing plan i'd make a new plan

530
00:37:38,866 --> 00:37:40,366
所以你制定了失败的计划
so you make plans that fail no

531
00:37:40,366 --> 00:37:43,066
他还玩循环霍根不相关相信我
he also plays the loop hogan not relevant trust me

532
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:44,266
我是不可或缺的
i'm indispensable

533
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:48,933
出色地
well

534
00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:52,933
我们试图取消锻造工作的计划都没有
none of the plans we've tried to take down forge of work

535
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,800
我们敢于质疑我们是如何上台的
we dare to question how we came to power

536
00:37:57,366 --> 00:37:59,200
所以他宣布我们为敌
so he declared us enemies

537
00:38:00,266 --> 00:38:02,333
开始摧毁我们的家园
began destroying our homes

538
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,966
处决我们的人
and executing our people

539
00:38:06,733 --> 00:38:08,733
如果你不尽快为我们停下来
if you don't stop for us soon

540
00:38:09,733 --> 00:38:11,566
将没有什么可捍卫的
there'll be nothing left to defend

541
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,566
这样做不是为了钱
not doing this for the money

542
00:38:18,133 --> 00:38:19,733
为说话到最后的人做这件事
do this for the people who talk to the end

543
00:38:19,733 --> 00:38:20,866
当没有人会
when no one else would

544
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,700
所以我们会保留你的份额
so we'll keep your share then

545
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:29,933
供热
supply the heat

546
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,766
想象他们
imagine them

547
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,600
姐姐
sister

548
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:39,500
但你一直遇到我最依赖的弟子
but you have always met the disciple i rely on most

549
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,700
你的冷静
of your calm

550
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,933
意思是你是我的印记
meaning that you're sigils from me

551
00:38:48,366 --> 00:38:51,900
我宁愿做朋友而不是因为我花时间
i'd rather be friends to unfait i'm spending on the hour

552
00:38:51,933 --> 00:38:52,733
带着食物
with food

553
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,000
那是可以忍受的
that has been sufferable

554
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,200
但如果没有他 我们永远不会走到这一步
but we never would have come this far without his

555
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,800
工作
job

556
00:39:03,766 --> 00:39:06,666
活着的人已经跟随这个世界够久了
the living has been followed this world long enough

557
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,166
太烦人了 但你这里的工作快完成了
takes so much annoying but your work here is nearly complete

558
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:20,366
脱下你的兜帽我注意到
with your hood off i noticed

559
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:26,000
可能最好保留那个你知道你在博览会上读过的旧东西
probably best to keep that old you know you read with the fair

560
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:29,166
不像你应该在外面那么受你好

足以说这是一个非常强大的法术

认为他们很残忍

583
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:48,066
上帝从来没有琥珀 我是非常不同的人 例如

将城市凝聚在一起
bring the city together like nothing else

591
00:41:00,933 --> 00:41:03,600
这不是政府的角色

592
00:41:03,733 --> 00:41:06,333
拒绝人们所渴望的

哦可惜但是
oh pity but

608
00:44:18,133 --> 00:44:19,700
如果一个金库还有更多的迦南
if a vault has more than canaans still

609
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,966
我们不会进入它是坚不可摧的 你不能
we're not getting in it's impenetrable can't you just

610
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,066
用魔法打开它

how everyone thinks that you can solve any problem with magic

613
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:30,133
有限制 这不是一些
there are limits this isn't some

614
00:44:30,533 --> 00:44:32,900
睡前故事这是真实的世界
bedtime story this is the real world

615
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,533
所以没有办法打开它
so there's no way to open it

616
00:44:34,766 --> 00:44:37,300
不要说我是世界上最强大的巫师之一
Don't mean if i were one of the world's most powerful sorcerers

617
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,533
所以不 或者如果我们有分离的家
so no or if we had the home of disjunction

623
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:52,900
找到那张专辑
find that album

624
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,500
即使我们这样做了 我也可以在不调整它的情况下使用它
even if we did i can use it without a tuning to it

625
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,366
我很糟糕

626
00:44:56,533 --> 00:44:57,333

631
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,533
什么士气

632
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,533
胡尔卡知道你的头盔在哪里
Hulka knows where the helmet is you

633
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,900
我的部落在埃文战争中为它与龙的崇拜战斗
my tribe fought the cult of the Dragon over it at the Evan Wars

634
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,300
我们可以问问他们会在哪里
we could just ask them where it would

635
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,166
那场战斗是一个世纪前他们都死了
that battle was a century ago they're all dead

636
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,866
所以用魔法问他
so ask him with magic

637
00:45:22,866 --> 00:45:24,866
他只是做了一个完整的演讲 他无法解决问题
he just made a whole speech how he can't fix

638
00:45:24,966 --> 00:45:25,933
一切都充满魔力
everything with magic

639
00:45:26,066 --> 00:45:28,266
其实那不是
actually that isn't

640
00:45:28,866 --> 00:45:30,200
你可以让死者复活
you can bring back the dead

641
00:45:30,566 --> 00:45:32,366
我不能带回来
i can't bring the back

642
00:45:32,366 --> 00:45:35,300
但我有这个令牌可以让我问尸体和问题
but i have this token that lets me ask corpses and questions

643
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,733
然后他们回去死了
and then they go back to be dead

644
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,100

01:07:59,933 --> 01:08:02,600
我能听到我也听到了
i can hear that i hear that as well

983
01:08:18,333 --> 01:08:20,133
到废墟只有你
out to the ruins just you

984
01:08:33,666 --> 01:08:37,700
摇摇晃晃地进入发誓要强大的吞噬者
rocking on into the devours sworn to formidable

985
01:08:37,966 --> 01:08:40,300
他们击晕目标并消耗大脑
they stun their targets and consume the brain

986
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,766
控制身体
take control the body

987
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:43,500
你会怎样不发出声音
what would you make no sound

988
01:08:44,933 --> 01:08:46,600
他们被精神能量所吸引
they're drawn to mental energy

989
01:08:47,466 --> 01:08:49,333
猎物的智力越高
higher the intelligence of the prey

990
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:51,900
最近他们要罢工
more lately they are to strike

991
01:09:08,666 --> 01:09:10,133
好吧 这有点伤人
well that's a little hurtful

992
01:09:11,933 --> 01:09:14,733
有这个悬空的毒品之城
there is this hanging city of dope

993
01:09:16,733 --> 01:09:19,300
头盔躺在这个鸿沟的快速生活上
the helmet lies on the fast life of this chasm

994
01:09:20,566 --> 01:09:24,800
但警告说这座桥受到古老的诺姆斯陷阱的保护
but the warned the bridge is protected by an ancient nomus trap

995
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:27,266
他有一个精确的公式
there was a precise formula with his follows

996
01:09:27,266 --> 01:09:28,766
尽可能多地触发机制
so as much trigger the mechanism

997
01:09:28,766 --> 01:09:29,800
公式是什么
what's the formula

998
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:30,800
这很简单
it's quite simple

999
01:09:31,766 --> 01:09:34,066
从中心开始使用奇数块
starting from the center used odd number blocks

1000
01:09:34,066 --> 01:09:36,600
除了每五步之外 只向前迈出每一步
only working forward with each step except for every fifth step

1001
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,066
这必须是最后一个滚动运动
which must be a last roll movement

1002
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:38,966
左还是右
left or right

1003
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:39,966
没关系那么久
it matters not so long

1004
01:09:39,966 --> 01:09:42,366
作为落后者中的领导者在之后保持等距
as the leader in the lagged remain equidistant after

1005
01:09:42,366 --> 01:09:43,366
它继续
which it proceed

1006
01:09:43,666 --> 01:09:45,800
然而肯定又是奇数块
again odd number blocks certainly however

1007
01:09:45,866 --> 01:09:48,333
并且中点在偶数块中切换
and the midpoint was switched in even number blocks

1008
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:50,166
同样的恐慌和横向运动
same panics and that lateral movement

1009
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:51,133
前
before

1010
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:04,566
我可能有
i may have

1011
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,000
把我的脚放在桥上
put my foot on the bridge

1012
01:10:07,666 --> 01:10:09,700
并意识到那是我开始的地方
and realize that's where i take it started

1013
01:10:12,933 --> 01:10:13,733
所以
so

1014
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:14,800
对不起
sorry

1015
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:22,866
它在结构上不是很南
it's not very structurally south

1016
01:10:25,066 --> 01:10:28,200
你就不能用魔法让我们穿越吗
can't you just magic us across

1017
01:10:28,366 --> 01:10:28,866
唔
hmm

1018
01:10:28,866 --> 01:10:30,866
这太过分了
it's too far tuck case this

1019
01:10:31,933 --> 01:10:33,700
我包里有绳子
i've got some rope in my bag

1020
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,500
我可以把它绑在斧头上
i could tie it to the axe

1021
01:10:35,533 --> 01:10:37,933
把它扔过去 让它粘在岩石上
toss it across so it sticks to the rock

1022
01:10:37,966 --> 01:10:40,700
你知道石头很硬就闭嘴
you know rocks are hard right shut up

1023
01:10:41,533 --> 01:10:42,600
你得到了什么
what did you get that

1024
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:45,800
当我女人的手杖
when my woman's walking stick

1025
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:48,200
我从一个巫师那里滑过葡萄
i swiped it from a wizard over the grapes

1026
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,933
它不是手杖
it's not a walking stick

1027
01:10:51,966 --> 01:10:53,333
这是第五名员工
it's a hit the fifth staff

1028
01:10:53,533 --> 01:10:54,300
什么

1035
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:15,600
我做得很好
i did good

1036
01:11:58,933 --> 01:12:00,300
正如我现在给你的
as i gave you now

1037
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,400
信任形象会用你的生命保护它

下来市中心

1045
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,733
这不是我们的戏剧
it's not our dramas

我们会睡觉
we will sleep

1052
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:30,500
为什么你把他们都杀了
why you killed them all

1053
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:33,266
没有简单的脚可以杀死已经死去的东西

我只能拉到那个工具

当我这么说的时候

01:19:00,066 --> 01:19:02,933
每个人都去水下 那将是你的七个

你不来我能做的事

这是你的任务

我已经给了你必须使用的工具

1130
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:35,000

所以我试图捕捉它

1138
01:24:28,266 --> 01:24:29,600

1144
01:24:44,933 --> 01:24:46,333
什么是球拍

1145
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,900
他在寻求帮助时遇到了一些麻烦
he's having a little trouble with that help

1146

this is exactly what i told you would happen back to the tabin

1150
01:24:56,966 --> 01:24:58,000
但你不会听
but you wouldn't listen

1151
01:24:58,566 --> 01:25:00,000
你告诉他什么意思
what do you mean you told him

1152
01:25:00,466 --> 01:25:04,200
他说为了鼓舞士气 我不知道为什么
he said to keep it between us for morale i didn't know why

1153
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:06,866
因为他是我认识的最猪头的人
because he is the most pig headed person i've ever known

1154
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:09,733
你说服我们做你知道行不通的事情
you talk us into doing things you know won't work

1155
01:25:09,733 --> 01:25:12,766
然后当它变得耐心时你会责怪我们如果你能调
and then you blame us when it goes patient if you can a tune

1156
01:25:12,766 --> 01:25:14,266
我们会想出一个计划b

计划b

我们挖出了我的家人 我们去地底暗区拿了那个头盔
we dug up my family we went to the underdark for that helmet

1159
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:20,200
你一直都知道他无法使用它
and you knew the whole time that he couldn't use it

1160
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:22,566
你们人类就是忍不住撒谎
you humans you just can't help but lie

1161
01:25:22,566 --> 01:25:26,133
我没有撒谎 我真的认为西蒙可以做男人的样子
i didn't lie i really thought Simon could do guys look

1162
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,800
我们还有几个小时的比赛时间
we got a couple hours still the games

1163
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,500
忘记这就是我们所做的
forget this is what we do

1164
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:32,500
我们转向而不是纠结于哪里出了问题
we pivot instead of dwelling on what went wrong

1165
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:34,866
谁对谁撒谎 让我们集思广益
who lied to whom let's put our heads together and figure out a

1166
01:25:34,933 --> 01:25:37,400
计划我会找到回家的路
plan i'm gonna figure out my way home

1167
01:25:37,866 --> 01:25:39,966

i can't believe i put my faith in any of you yeah

1168
01:25:39,966 --> 01:25:42,333
我会为基拉感到抱歉
i'm going to sorry about Kira

1169
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,933
找到另一种方法来得到她只是不是今天
find another way to get her just not today

1170
01:25:48,133 --> 01:25:51,100
必须是今天 直到我女儿安全 我们才结束
has to be today we're not done until my daughter's safe

1171
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:53,200
你不厌倦失败吗？
don't you sick of failing no

1172
01:25:53,266 --> 01:25:55,933
这就是我们绝不能停止失败的重点
that's the whole point we must never stop failing

1173
01:25:55,933 --> 01:25:57,066
因为我们做的那一刻
because the minute we do

1174
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:58,533
我们失败了
we failed

1175
01:26:00,866 --> 01:26:03,333
看我们这里没有人能说出我们的生活
look none of us here can say our lives

1176
01:26:03,766 --> 01:26:05,400
已经走了我们希望的路
have gone the way we had hoped for

1177
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,000
是的
right

1178
01:26:07,533 --> 01:26:11,766
霍尔加你离开了你的部落去和一个离开你的人在一起
holga you left your tribe to be with a man who left you

1179
01:26:11,766 --> 01:26:14,600
因为你对离开你的部落感到非常沮丧
because you were so upset about leaving your tribe

1180
01:26:15,166 --> 01:26:16,133
如果你现在退出
and if you quit now

1181
01:26:16,133 --> 01:26:17,200
那是石头
that's in stone

1182
01:26:17,733 --> 01:26:19,066
和你签的一样
same with you signed it

1183
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:22,366
你是一个小偷大盗 作为一个小资源提供者
you're a petty thief mass grating as a petty resourcer

1184
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,766
你得回你的店
you gotta go back to your shop

1185
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,100
最好是垂死的
is best the dying

1186
01:26:25,466 --> 01:26:27,800
有比死去的笨蛋更糟糕的事情
there's worse things than dying dork

1187
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,000
你有诚信
you have integrity

1188
01:26:29,066 --> 01:26:31,066
我确定你最不想做的事
and i am sure the last thing you want to do

1189
01:26:31,066 --> 01:26:33,366
是告诉翡翠飞地你有机会救他
is tell the emerald enclave that you had a chance to save him

1190
01:26:33,366 --> 01:26:34,566
但你走开了嘿
but you walked away hey

1191
01:26:34,566 --> 01:26:37,600
你很快就说我们失败了你和我呢
you're quick to call us failures what about you and me

1192
01:26:38,466 --> 01:26:40,533
我是失败的冠军
i'm the champion of failures

1193
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:43,266
我失去了对我来说最重要的一切
i lost everything that ever mattered to me

1194
01:26:43,266 --> 01:26:44,500
都是我的错
and it was all my fault

1195
01:26:50,766 --> 01:26:52,366
我真的会杀了我的妻子吗
would i really killed my wife

1196
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:56,500
我做了
i did

1197
01:26:57,933 --> 01:26:58,900
我决定
i decided

1198
01:26:59,266 --> 01:27:02,166
我们应该过比房子里的哈珀区更好的生活
we deserved better life than a harper zone through our house

1199
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,666
但我不知道红巫师标记了他们的宝藏
but i didn't know that red wizards marked their treasure

1200
01:27:09,866 --> 01:27:11,100
让他们到我们家门口
let them right to our door

1201
01:27:14,133 --> 01:27:16,800
当他们到达那里时 我什至没有好运回家
i didn't even have a good luck to be home when they got there

1202
01:27:18,966 --> 01:27:21,766
辜负了竖琴手 我辜负了我的家人 我辜负了你们所有人
failed the harpers i failed my family i failed all of you

1203
01:27:21,933 --> 01:27:25,133
这正是我不能退出的原因所以如果你能原谅我
which is exactly why i can't quit so if you'll excuse me

1204
01:27:25,133 --> 01:27:26,733
我要去坐在这块石头上
i'm gonna go sit on this rock

1205
01:27:27,766 --> 01:27:28,800
制定一个计划
make a plan

1206
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:19,900
它是做什么的 但是没有
what's it do but there's no

1207
01:28:20,333 --> 01:28:21,133
更多的
more

1208
01:28:24,133 --> 01:28:25,066
对这个
about this

1209
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:29,166
我们使用他们的员工进入保险库
we use the hither that their staff to get into the vault

1210
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:32,466
我已经解释过你不能把它打到房间里因为
i've explained that you can't hit the thither into a room cause

1211
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:34,533
我不是说我是说
i'm not saying that i'm saying

1212
01:28:34,933 --> 01:28:36,600
我们把传送门放在某物上
we put the portal on something

1213
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:38,866
然后把那东西偷偷带进金库
and then sneak that thing into the vault

1214
01:28:40,133 --> 01:28:42,366
进入那个金库的唯一东西就是宝藏
the only thing going in that vault is treasure

1215
01:28:42,466 --> 01:28:44,466
所以我们把传送门放在一些宝藏上
so we put the portal on some treasure

1216
01:28:47,133 --> 01:28:49,533
因为你说的是??巴尔塔最富有的人给了他们
for what you did say the richest men in baltars gave them

1217
01:28:49,533 --> 01:28:51,666
水更深 给城市带来战利品

1218

车队但是有几十个警卫是的
convoys but there be dozens of guards yeah

1220
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,133
警卫会提防
the guards would be guarding against

1221
01:28:59,133 --> 01:29:02,366
人们把东西从他们的马车里拿出来而不是把它们放进去
people taking things out of their wagon without putting them in

1222
01:29:02,366 --> 01:29:03,666
哦上帝可以吻你
oh god could kiss you

1223
01:31:33,266 --> 01:31:35,400

这是你好你的好

1226
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:41,933
人从来没有时间复工
people have never been time to the resumption

1227
01:31:42,166 --> 01:31:44,533
我们的眼睛在这里

你来这里是为了最聪明的奇观
that you are here for the most intelligent spectacle of

1230
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:54,000

1234
01:32:01,133 --> 01:32:04,266

1235
01:32:04,533 --> 01:32:06,933
进入下一阶段

1236
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,333
我中的一个人我确实在争论
one of me i do argue

1237
01:32:10,333 --> 01:32:12,900
请不要离开竞技场
please do not leave the arena

1238
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:16,400
到大门的尽头 因为会有我们自己的

每个人的礼物
gift for each and every one

1245
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:56,866
为什么什么都不如我们所愿

1246
01:32:56,866 --> 01:32:58,766
让我试试 也许我可以挑选帽子

能够区分自己的

你不得不承认我可以给基拉更好的生活
you'd have to admit i can give Kira a better life

我希望你知道后能感到安慰

给我们一个战斗的机会

1359
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:17,466
那不是机会
that's not a chance

1360
01:42:17,466 --> 01:42:18,800
这根本不是机会
it's not a chance at all

1361
01:42:19,366 --> 01:42:22,600
即使你能活下来 我也告诉他关于 safenas 的事

they defeated your men and mine let them fight in the arena

1366
01:42:36,566 --> 01:42:38,200

and i got us right above where gordons at the treasure was

1373
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:02,666
是不是有点怀疑
is it a little suspect

1374
01:43:02,666 --> 01:43:04,166
那就是如果你知道什么同意这个
that's if you know what agree to this

1375

是的 她肯定是有计划的

那只是给了金库最大值

1385
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:32,566
如果磁带更大 他会带回游戏
