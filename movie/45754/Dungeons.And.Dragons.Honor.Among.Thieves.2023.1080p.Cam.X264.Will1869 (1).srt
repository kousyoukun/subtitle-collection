1
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:16,469
Knew Grace is their soulmate.

2
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,373
So, so lovely

3
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:23,843
that let's show your own.

4
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,913
This is the book where our phrases and

5
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,049
that's it.

6
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,851
What's your name?

7
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:32,519
That's Moga.

8
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,122
I I'm again, if you are a billionaire,
no sense

9
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:40,793
ever say
what will female think of an idea?

10
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,629
Word of advice.

11
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,598
Who doesn't love to be disturbed
while she's eating her potatoes?

12
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,400
Kind of the highlight of her day.

13
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,137
So you should think about it.

14
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,706
Sure, I know so.

15
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:59,179
But what you do, your you

16
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:03,950
figure out.

17
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,424
You're going to do this now for you.

18
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,593
Make it a commitment.

19
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:14,294
What's your name?

20
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:15,028
Press

21
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,865
Not for Babe

22
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:20,400
Ruth.

23
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,536
Just simply don't look.

24
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,272
You carry three.

25
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:34,881
Absolution.

26
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,951
Can you get your hopes up?

27
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,621
Oh, Jonathan's on the story.

28
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,690
He's an attorney.

29
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,092
One's going to freeze him. You're going to

30
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:47,994
pay all.

31
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,097
This is your jumping.

32
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,902
By authority

33
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,838
of the Lords against this execution.

34
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:05,912
Council will now come to order in the case
of in Davos and hold the cable.

35
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:12,719
This is the second year of incarceration
for the crimes of grand larceny.

36
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,256
And so this is the task of this Council

37
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,192
to determine
what happens if they were to come out.

38
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,227
What say you.

39
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,962
Made interesting

40
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,332
statements?

41
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:31,170
Before I get off,
I notice that Sir Jonathan is not present

42
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,573
in perhaps way to Chancellor.

43
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,308
Jonathan was delayed by the storm.

44
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,876
You may begin, I say.

45
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:42,282
It's just that I we we're really counting
on him to attend again.

46
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,452
In your statement through.

47
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,822
I should start by giving you some context.

48
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,326
You may be surprised to learn
I wasn't always a thief.

49
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,665
Years ago I became a member of
the Harper's faction, A network of spies.

50
00:04:58,665 --> 00:04:59,999
You swore an oath to fight

51
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:03,703
tyranny and defend the oppressed
and to ask nothing in return.

52
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:10,443
My wife supported my decision,
even though she knew the risks.

53
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,512
I didn't mean any role. Mercenaries

54
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:20,753
in Springfield.

55
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:23,323
Missouri, Chief Justice

56
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,492
I know

57
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,795
I'm coming home to my loving wife
and daughter,

58
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:31,664
to be honest.

59
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,534
When challenged,
when I began to question asking

60
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,602
nothing in return,

61
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,405
my wife would always say,

62
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:42,608
You have to give us everything
you have to give us. So

63
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:44,577
it goes by.

64
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:48,815
And secondly, the you what we said
right before this is that based on

65
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:52,518
what I know about Jonathan, I think
he'd be especially receptive to my story.

66
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,119
And I hate that.

67
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,654
So we had a whole year to come back.

68
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,689
And we'll see.

69
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,891
Absolutely. Here we go.

70
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,260
When you were a Harper,
you were bound to make enemies.

71
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,564
In some times
those enemies come looking for

72
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,853
reasons,
but there was no way to revive her.

73
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,123
We see you die.

74
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,291
You in my devotion

75
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:23,876
and. Oh,

76
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,078
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:30,216
Are you reading this?

78
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,017
Jonathan?

79
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:34,821
Here it came, but he missed
the most important part of the story.

80
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,256
I'm getting just me
without knowing my motivation.

81
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:37,590
We are.

82
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,226
Entirely capable of deciding your case
without.

83
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,695
Jonathan. And on with it. Rose.

84
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,799
Overnight, I come home to my loving wife
and daughter.

85
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,434
I went back to far.

86
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,870
Stop starting right? Sorry.

87
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,272
In broad strokes, the next few months

88
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,942
were among my most shameful

89
00:07:57,176 --> 00:08:00,213
and that's why I hope

90
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,449
she took pity on me.

91
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:07,019
Well, she took pity on the baby

92
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,588
girl. Was a fellow resident of Iraq.

93
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:09,255
A lot of

94
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,725
many years
before she'd been cast out of her

95
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:19,465
life, were falling in love
with an outside.

96
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:23,736
He quickly became like brother and sister
with a relationship of trust

97
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:28,741
and mutual respect.

98
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,310
Neither of us had money
or an honest way to earn it,

99
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,749
so we decided to table Ernest
and we tried something new.

100
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:40,520
It's intoxicating when you realize
that what separates you from

101
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,923
what you've always wanted to be thin.

102
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:59,872
As a piece of glass.

103
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,774
You may be wondering how you carry out

104
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,609
this criminal lifestyle
with a young girl. How?

105
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:05,678
Well we didn't.

106
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:11,117
Leave her home.

107
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,052
There was a new interview.

108
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,721
We also added Simon Schuster.

109
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:19,525
And commenting for us to keep an eye on

110
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,732
who could give it to you.

111
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,569
Yes, we were thieves, but.

112
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,637
I tried to hold this to a service.

113
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,941
We never harmed anyone
and we only robbed from those who.

114
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,742
Feel at least

115
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,313
when everything changed
when we met the wizard.

116
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,214
Sophie, you know,

117
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:44,717
we do almost nothing about her.

118
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,820
Only that she wanted our help
with Robin Courts keep.

119
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,355
That's door Harper struggle.

120
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,456
I don't know if you've heard of it.

121
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:53,759
I'm sure Jordan has

122
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,930
priceless relics from people
whose only a purpose can.

123
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,432
Gain access to the vault.

124
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,667
Which is why so few that came to us.

125
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,002
At first I refused.

126
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,004
I was duped. That low.

127
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,540
But then Forge told me that among
the relics was

128
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,577
it was a tablet of re-awakening,
capable of bringing back

129
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:15,781
single deceased person
through and killed by a red wizard's play.

130
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,218
You can probably see where this is going.

131
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,820
I can't recount. Sorry, Karen.

132
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,723
This was too. Dangerous.
And you shouldn't go.

133
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,692
We have everything that we need.

134
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:29,161
Oh, yeah, but this is the last one.

135
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:39,305
Trust me, right now.

136
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,673
I didn't tell her about the tablet.

137
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,742
The breakthrough article we shared. In

138
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,445
two should went

139
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:38,364
for about,

140
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:55,948
you know,

141
00:11:55,948 --> 00:12:11,831
she's got to stop.

142
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:18,537
You're curiosity safe.

143
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:31,083
You have my word.

144
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,153
Even if this council were to sentence me
to another two years.

145
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:38,457
Or 20 for that matter,
it would never be punishment enough.

146
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,493
Or the worst crime I ever committed

147
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,098
robbing my daughter of her father

148
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,801
to know that if you do choose to free me,

149
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:54,607
spend the rest of my days
trying to write that wrong.

150
00:12:54,607 --> 00:13:03,415
Anything with that?

151
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,619
Before you announce your decision,
I implore you to please

152
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,320
wait for

153
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,624
the day.

154
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,792
I can't tell you how

155
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,262
you when you.

156
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:07,146
Are still breathing.

157
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,555
For a while.

158
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:41,073
And where do you think Forge took her?

159
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:42,508
I can't see anything.

160
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:46,445
The story comes from dramas like Citizens.

161
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,781
Some suffer. You and your wife.

162
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,116
What to do with

163
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,351
those little girls?

164
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:56,021
Just the grace.

165
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,057
So we take a vote down voters day

166
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,193
and then head north.

167
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:02,761
We're looking for voyage.

168
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:06,231
Only Marlow and Elizabeth.

169
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,100
If you really want
to put yourself through them.

170
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,135
What if they just want to talk to you?

171
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,705
It's not about what he wants.

172
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,073
It's about closure.

173
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:18,277
You said you had to save your husband
from it.

174
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:19,712
You wouldn't understand.

175
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:20,412
I don't.

176
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:27,519
I clearly, I really don't.

177
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,487
Is that

178
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,824
son of a bitch?

179
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,624
For she is.

180
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:36,328
Lord never would her. At that level. That

181
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,298
was the least she's got here.

182
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:39,932
I don't care.

183
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:43,068
Come on, let's go.

184
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,270
Thanks, ma'am.

185
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,839
You're too big for your face.

186
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,374
A lot of people like me.

187
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:48,841
That's

188
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:19,538
never seen this.

189
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,906
Piece of crap.

190
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:22,241
It must be concluded.

191
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,577
And I said,
I want that to be the last one.

192
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,046
Before they were out.

193
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,548
On one.

194
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,449
Duncan says he moved.

195
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,851
To the front around the four months
reign of seven years.

196
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:39,992
So it's nice to see

197
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:48,400
for just the last six.

198
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,835
How long has it been?

199
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,336
Two years. No.

200
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:55,574
How long we've been waiting here.

201
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:59,411
Tad, look, I've been. Here

202
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:04,683
for a while, but.

203
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:16,328
I was sober one.

204
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:22,601
I thought of me every night.

205
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:27,072
I mean.

206
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,741
What are many. Moons?

207
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,277
Oh, things

208
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,180
have did okay

209
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,181
before.

210
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:41,220
Just been very
good to me, Uncle George. He

211
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,991
wants to see

212
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,092
stories.

213
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,827
Anytime you

214
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,063
use it to sneak around the guests.

215
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,564
Sometimes

216
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,901
it's a strange thing you're here.

217
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,971
Your book.

218
00:18:58,971 --> 00:18:59,671
I want you to know.

219
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:03,242
And I'm so sorry
for how things turned out.

220
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,310
I took a risk.

221
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,279
I didn't pay off.

222
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,149
Or even let me.

223
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,652
Because you're acting like
it wasn't your fault

224
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,089
that you know. Oh.

225
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,359
Oh, Fred,

226
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,161
what a wonderful surprise.

227
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:27,799
Come.

228
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,536
Do I spy in the middle grade?

229
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,204
I do. I like it.

230
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,673
Scoundrel. Professorial.

231
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,775
You like a tutor? Really?

232
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:41,180
I got a will Rich with scripts and

233
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,716
an God.

234
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,619
I know you don't like hugs,
but I know what

235
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,527
it last year.

236
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:58,931
But I tell you what,
I don't think it's that long ago.

237
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,499
Oh, we.

238
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,801
We got an early release.

239
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,671
Good behavior. Yup. Having been good.

240
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:07,573
I see.

241
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:08,373
Well, welcome.

242
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,008
Welcome back.

243
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,146
This blistering, blisteringly hot
and yet again

244
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:18,217
you're from speak to the kitchen staff
because there's simply no need for it

245
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,052
to be this.

246
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,253
Yeah. These are.

247
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,822
So how are you, The Lord of Neverwinter?

248
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:28,460
Right before you went off to prison,
you charged me with gear as well.

249
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,598
Be didn't think much of it at the time,
but there came a moment

250
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:36,235
when I looked into her eyes and
I suddenly knew I had to be a better man.

251
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,937
Obviously I couldn't give back
the treasure we'd stolen.

252
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,873
So when Lord never fairly who I would

253
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,910
seize the chance
to try and make a difference.

254
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,813
And the money from guards
keep paved the way for my campaign.

255
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,181
But I will tell you, this

256
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,117
couldn't have done it alone.

257
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,319
And here she is.

258
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,254
You remember

259
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:57,522
still working with her.

260
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,791
She's the one that got us
caught up through.

261
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,361
I hope without her
we would have been caught.

262
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:09,268
And since then,
she has become my top advisor.

263
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,202
The tea is scorching.

264
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:10,936
I do apologize.

265
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,072
It's scorching hot.

266
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,007
So you know

267
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:16,341
what?

268
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,677
Would you mind that option?

269
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:26,051
70. Good.

270
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,886
Thank you. I.

271
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,424
I didn't realize you were there,
but you can get in in the cops.

272
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,992
I'm going to need that for later.

273
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:36,128
Well,
if you'll give us the tablet, you're okay.

274
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,563
And I will be on our way.

275
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:38,964
Of course.

276
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,532
That's why you came back.

277
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,902
It wasn't for me,
was for that tablet of riches.

278
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,738
Riches, little. Instant.

279
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,907
It's a tablet of reawakening.

280
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,342
So I once this now.

281
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,744
The reason
why I agreed to the to the house

282
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:55,547
is that somebody has told you
that I left you for riches.

283
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,249
I told you the truth.

284
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:00,118
She has a right to know it.

285
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:01,953
He's been lying to you. Here I am.

286
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,255
I wanted to.

287
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:04,756
I wanted to bring your mother back.

288
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:05,824
Oh, come on.

289
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,859
Look,
I know how much you crave forgiveness,

290
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,862
but I promise
you, more lies is not the way you snake.

291
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:14,032
You know damn
well what he was after everything.

292
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,567
You tell me if you were doing it for me.

293
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,504
Because I didn't
want you to lose her again if I failed.

294
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,640
You can't blame the poor girl
distrusting him.

295
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,042
After all,

296
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,713
you have been lying
since you set foot in the room.

297
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:34,152
I'm you.

298
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,053
You escaped.

299
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:37,222
We were trying to get back to you. Back
here.

300
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:37,889
Look at.

301
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:38,290
Me. I see.

302
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,692
I swear to you,
it was a tablet of reawakening.

303
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,228
I was doing it for Mom, for all of us.

304
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,130
You have to trust me.

305
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:49,101
You told me to trust you when you left me

306
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:51,002
here.

307
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,905
No, wait, wait. Kiera, give it. Time.

308
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:57,109
She's had years to resent you
for your absence.

309
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,644
You've had years to poison her against me.

310
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,114
No, that is not true.

311
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:04,049
Whether he read his book and would.

312
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,418
Give him what he came for. The tablet.

313
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,920
I don't think I will be returning it.

314
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,157
Or. Your daughter for that.

315
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:22,501
But that's all.

316
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:25,937
You know, really.

317
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:29,841
He had a very, very powerful her,
you know, so that, you know,

318
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:33,979
love that the last time she trapped you.

319
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,981
You were in the city of God.

320
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,215
I wanted you.

321
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,484
Inside, but he managed to. Escape.

322
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:41,987
All these years to you.

323
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,022
You double crossed this, which.

324
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,426
Never put your trust in a con man
for this.

325
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:51,263
Kira really is happy
and very well taken care of here.

326
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,299
And I have truly come to love as my own.

327
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,103
I never actually saw the appeal
of being a father till I became one.

328
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:02,307
But to have another person
look up to you and.

329
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,943
I know you try to shape them in your own
image.

330
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,379
It's a goal

331
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:11,817
I will never I'm a God
and the Lord I am really doing all right.

332
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:12,684
Blackwood

333
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:14,686
Could you possibly

334
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:17,956
return to prison and be sure?

335
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,658
Well, I missed the way I am.

336
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:22,961
Expecting two of the wealthiest men
from all of us gave an awful deep

337
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,997
talk about the high games which are back.

338
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,934
So that's something, isn't it?

339
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,802
It was genuinely love it, you see.

340
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,438
But we are.

341
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:48,420
Going to get her out of there.

342
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,456
Will need to think about her right now.

343
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:54,292
Yeah. You got this right.

344
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:57,095
Down on your knees.

345
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,134
And a great

346
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:06,738
It's not the work of yellow room Bohemia.

347
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:07,639
Would you know.

348
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,975
Mainly on the last

349
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,312
as a week as a very.

350
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,082
It's dark still.

351
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,250
Very nice.

352
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,152
Put your heads down.

353
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,753
Wait,

354
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:25,690
what do you clean it with?

355
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,626
You're about to lose your head.

356
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:28,860
This is what you said.

357
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,830
If you wouldn't mind.

358
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:36,535
Boiled linseed oil

359
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,369
once a month.

360
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,703
She'd be once a week.

361
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,373
That's where you get rest of it.

362
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:42,974
Okay. Chop it off.

363
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:43,441
Top it off.

364
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:44,276
Let's go

365
00:25:52,617 --> 00:26:11,703
to the.

366
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,772
We gonna go

367
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,119
through.

368
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:41,299
Before we leave.

369
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:42,033
The city.

370
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,302
Will visit you.

371
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:53,345
Know, not.

372
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:58,817
I wanted to make sure you were all right.

373
00:26:58,817 --> 00:26:59,751
I knew it.

374
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,056
Would be different.

375
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,826
You have to understand.

376
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,929
When you lost to Mother

377
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:19,304
who lost himself.

378
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,573
Maybe he was ashamed to admit
how much you given.

379
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:26,778
Up the facility.

380
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:31,416
I think I speak to.

381
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:31,850
Well,

382
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:33,785
when he's gone.

383
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:34,653
You gone?

384
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,224
I gave him the tablets, which is,

385
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:45,096
you know,

386
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,398
longer to

387
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,100
them. So.

388
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,371
And I want you to know, even if.

389
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:55,340
He is left with.

390
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:59,077
I always will.

391
00:27:59,077 --> 00:27:59,411
I know.

392
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,648
The fact that you see good in me

393
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,784
makes me believe that
that might just be something.

394
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:10,855
You didn't have to.

395
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:11,856
Answer.

396
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,359
That's a risk we're going to have to take.

397
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,494
Killing my daughter with an arrow.

398
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:18,296
No, it's not.

399
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,432
If she got the message from the company,

400
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:23,468
this is for her that

401
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,972
if you get to that castle
and take daughter's house.

402
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:29,808
That's crazy.

403
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:31,843
Castle never is tighter than corn. Even.

404
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,712
You know what happened with that?

405
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,780
With me to.

406
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:37,716
Take Who's going to help us?

407
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,618
We have nothing to pay the Fords does.

408
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:45,390
He said the richest people were coming
to violence against the fortune.

409
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,458
Oh, yeah.

410
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:49,160
Not to mention the tablet.

411
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,896
Will we abandon the right reasons?

412
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,267
I wouldn't put it like that, but.

413
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:57,235
Yeah, Yeah.

414
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,505
But we get this too.

415
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:00,872
You know?

416
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,941
I wonder if son still in tribe war.

417
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,375
Simon's a terrible. Choice.

418
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,211
Have you seen the two years?

419
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,313
I'm sure he's got the better.

420
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:16,721
No one can hold a candle to this tree.

421
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:18,056
How about this one?

422
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,825
People like to smell fresh across

423
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:24,896
all that.

424
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,531
It's fresh across.

425
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,600
My five year old can do that magic.

426
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,202
But can you do this?

427
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:32,237
I just

428
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,740
for. You.

429
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,642
He hasn't gotten many.

430
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,444
Hints about what he's doing up there.

431
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,713
This is quite hard to be slightly
blurry like this.

432
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:45,150
It would be better, Larry,
but it's slightly blurry.

433
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:48,520
That's the real magic.

434
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,420
Is that.

435
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,765
He's like, you know, business.

436
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:03,902
Is no way things got going

437
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:39,337
for you.

438
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:44,909
I think this show, you're going.

439
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:45,543
Back my.

440
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,630
You look, Simon.

441
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,399
Oh, come on, we're. Out

442
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:23,882
as soon as we left.

443
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,383
Now, both of them tried to kill me.

444
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,051
Just stood by.

445
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,054
No, this proves she made Lord
never before built to command

446
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:34,092
the forged magic
is going to hold up to yourself.

447
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,760
Sure. So you show?

448
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,027
Yeah.

449
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,096
You did her with that
fresh cut grass trick.

450
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:39,831
Now, it's funny.

451
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,200
Look, I don't blame you
for wanting to save Kira.

452
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,004
And I love the idea of knocking
foes off his perch, But Robin calls.

453
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:48,840
Whenever is it worth the risk
rather than your is

454
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,744
brokering desperate?

455
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:56,681
He was planning on sleeping in the bed
tonight, and that seems imprudent.

456
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:01,085
So do we even know what sorts of arcane
magic is protecting the home?

457
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,153
We're going to find.

458
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,856
Out how you're going to sneak
past the entire castle. Walk me

459
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,224
through it.

460
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,126
Maybe a wild shriek.

461
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:11,095
They get in and out undetected as

462
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,164
you. As a mouse or a deer?

463
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,133
Yes, a deer.

464
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,201
And all the other deer in the castle.

465
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,904
Don't mind if I drew it.

466
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:22,040
I know it.

467
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,376
You're doing
This is truly one of the kind.

468
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:28,413
So romantic in nature.

469
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,648
Yeah.

470
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:34,285
She, however, found my lack of self-esteem
unattractive on.

471
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:36,521
My first trip.

472
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:41,426
Thank you. On

473
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:45,430
the first nice

474
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,732
part of it

475
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:51,936
for the crime are speaking about me in.

476
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,672
The world. The banquet will never relent.

477
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:56,874
Justice cannot be killed on my.

478
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,510
Endorsement of

479
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:18,296
this personal more.

480
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:59,303
That's a do

481
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:11,349
is this is just a

482
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,150
theory. You are.

483
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,552
Wait, wait, wait.

484
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,386
Simon.

485
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,021
Simon. Who?

486
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:19,290
Patrick Simon

487
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,692
AMA sorcerer

488
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:23,928
I called to do.

489
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:25,730
He said I made you feel sad.

490
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,299
Don't fear anything. I did just who I was.

491
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:32,103
Oh, yeah?

492
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:33,137
Yeah.

493
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,706
What are you doing here? We need to do.

494
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,341
We don't need to do.

495
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:38,543
We're going to take them, for instance.

496
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:41,479
Why? For

497
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,418
so I can live here.

498
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,621
I was born to humans, decided
they didn't want to take my child.

499
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:53,124
No one else took me on.

500
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,226
We're doing the emerald on the to.

501
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:55,526
Let's see.

502
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:56,994
That's all the more reason for

503
00:34:56,994 --> 00:35:00,198
with the only one
to get to that castle unseen hellhole.

504
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,901
As you can imagine, I don't trust yours.

505
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:07,038
I find it to be hateful, selfish.

506
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,006
Funny, you know, to be lonely.

507
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:11,042
And if it helps, I'm only half you.

508
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,678
But you're about source her, though.

509
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,680
She's a bloody sorcerer.

510
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,715
He's a descendant of elements from war.

511
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:21,085
The only way to succeed in this
is to have confidence that it can be done.

512
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,820
He doesn't?

513
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,755
Yeah, I suppose that's okay.

514
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:28,726
Look,
Simon may not have my a bit of straight,

515
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:33,064
but when it comes to the second
hand of the person's right is human.

516
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:35,133
So I know.

517
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,236
Exactly that you Frankenstein.

518
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,471
The player you

519
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:42,874
make plans.

520
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:44,509
You've already made the plan.

521
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:47,278
So what value do you have now?

522
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:49,013
If the plan fails

523
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:52,250
it just then I make an important

524
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,751
show. You make plans that fail? No.

525
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,254
He also plays the hook.
Not relevant. Trust me.

526
00:35:56,487 --> 00:36:02,660
I mean indispensable.

527
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,164
None of the plans we've tried to take down
Forge have worked.

528
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,601
We dare to question how we came to power.

529
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,371
So he declared us enemies.

530
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,439
If you have destroying our homes

531
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:21,345
and executing our people, don't stop for.

532
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:26,584
To be nothing left to defend. I'm

533
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:31,622
not doing this for the money.

534
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:33,925
Guys, for the people who took me in
when no one else would.

535
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:37,762
So you should.

536
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,668
Plenty.

537
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:44,902
I'm just

538
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,172
thirsty

539
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:51,776
to sleep.

540
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:54,111
I almost for.

541
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,614
Was your card.

542
00:36:57,248 --> 00:37:00,751
You need not just me.

543
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,589
Rather be servants from three.

544
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:08,192
Hours with to be

545
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:09,060
something

546
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:12,496
that we.

547
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:14,966
Never would have come this far.

548
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:18,536
So the thing is to solve.

549
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:21,606
This for me now, for

550
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:23,808
tonight.

551
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:28,879
Come on.

552
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,381
Here you

553
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:32,984
with your hood off.

554
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,686
I notice.

555
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,688
Probably best to keep that old.

556
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:38,823
You know, you read this.

557
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:42,893
They're not as popular
as you should be outside, but.

558
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:46,564
And of course, you're about
to be considerably this popular.

559
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,334
But. But far, far be it for me.

560
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:53,638
Earth to tell you what to do.

561
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,206
Caldwell and Peter Dostum arrived.

562
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,340
I was going to give you

563
00:37:57,908 --> 00:37:59,043
all. I really have to

564
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,412
do something about it. J

565
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:04,982
Now, I think you will find that

566
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:08,953
we have taken every imaginable measure
to protect the assets that you made.

567
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,522
You may not choose wages during the high.

568
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:15,526
Some games we have Newport
College fees on everyone in the console.

569
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,629
If the alarm is raised, nobody gets in

570
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,332
or out.

571
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:22,967
People.

572
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:29,006
Then there is the hope itself.

573
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:30,374
My Chief Advisor Sabine.

574
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:34,845
I can give you all the pieces.

575
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:44,822
It is protected by the arcane
seal of more than ten.

576
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:45,423
Well,

577
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:49,160
perhaps not all the details, but

578
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:53,164
suffice to say it is a seriously powerful
spell.

579
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:56,000
Let's find out what prompted you
to resume the games.

580
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,469
I would never, ever considered them.
Quite brutal.

581
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,771
Lord, never.
Amber and I very different men.

582
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:02,640
For example, I prefer to be off in a boat.

583
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,109
He prefers to be in a vegetative state.

584
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:09,113
I'm not you.

585
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,781
I can't be in. I, I.

586
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:14,118
The truth is that the games
bring the city together like nothing else.

587
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,787
And it is not the role of government

588
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:22,126
to deny the people what crave or to deny

589
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:26,664
you rich bastards
the right to profit off them.

590
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:33,137
Now, who wants refreshments seats?

591
00:39:33,137 --> 00:40:07,505
A wild sea is among us. Who

592
00:41:34,325 --> 00:42:09,426
are concluding.

593
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,363
So she did become a dear.

594
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:17,368
Are you absolutely sure
that Safina saw her markings?

595
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,336
I wonder. I can count seven times.

596
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:21,672
First of all, this got my daughter Red.

597
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:22,806
Was her fault.

598
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:27,111
It's protected by something called Morning
Caymans Origins.

599
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:28,379
Modern Cayman.

600
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,681
Yeah, that's a pity.

601
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:33,317
But it's a vault. Has more things to know.

602
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:34,885
And then punishment.

603
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:38,022
Is so bad with magic.

604
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:38,656
Right?

605
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:41,458
How everyone thinks
that you can solve any problem with magic.

606
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:42,693
There are limits.

607
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,828
This isn't some bedtime story.

608
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:46,530
This is the real world.

609
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,065
So there's no way to open it.

610
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:52,236
I mean, if I were one of the world's
most powerful sorcerers and know of.

611
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,772
We had the helm of this junction

612
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:55,639
the way it's.

613
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:58,042
It's a helmet
that disables all nearby enchantments.

614
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:59,209
But it doesn't matter.

615
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,245
That thing went missing. Ages. We're done.

616
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,080
Oh, come on.

617
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,916
I was. We can find there now.

618
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,852
But even if. We did,
I can use it without a tune into it.

619
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:10,020
Which I'm terrible.

620
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,689
You can do it. I know you can.

621
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,057
Say that doesn't get. So.

622
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:14,525
Yeah, but you saying it does.

623
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:16,894
I can't give little one.

624
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:18,629
Just no. Fun.

625
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,598
We just keep this between us.

626
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,633
Around what. Move our

627
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,037
knows for the is. Do.

628
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:30,140
My tribe fight the cult of the dragon
over it at the Everglades?

629
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:31,709
We can just ask them where.

630
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,644
That bastard was a century ago.

631
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:34,645
They're all dead.

632
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,213
So ask him with magic.

633
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:37,381
He just made a whole speech.

634
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,249
He can't fix everything with magic.

635
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:41,085
Actually, that isn't the method.

636
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:43,954
But you can bring back the dead.

637
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,723
I can't bring them back.

638
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:46,991
But I have this token

639
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:49,827
that lets me ask corpses questions
and then they go back to being dead.

640
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,463
Yeah. Yeah.

641
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,165
It's fairly wonderful.

642
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:56,266
Off the horse.

643
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,736
Thank you so much for the drinks.

644
00:43:58,736 --> 00:43:59,970
Oh, what?

645
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:00,537
Just pay.

646
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:01,839
It was magic.

647
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:26,363
To see that.

648
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:28,732
Side. Of.

649
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:35,539
Some of you

650
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:50,688
can you

651
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:10,607
move it to.

652
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:13,177
Where we are?

653
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:16,814
You really want to do it yourself?

654
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:37,468
Just going to pick
up some of my things. Oh,

655
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:40,270
hello, my man.

656
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,372
That's my element

657
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:44,174
of surprise.

658
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:45,809
The first time we met.

659
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:48,946
I thought your sentence was longer.

660
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:51,715
I busted out of the.

661
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,688
Same old ogre.

662
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,957
So what have you been up to?

663
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:02,926
Oh, the usual.

664
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,729
Good. My garden working on my book.

665
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:08,132
I see you still have that walking stick
I gave you?

666
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:09,533
Yeah.

667
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,468
Yeah, well, you can.

668
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:13,704
You can take it with you
if you want. Quinn's not.

669
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:14,671
Much for rambling.

670
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:15,639
Glen. You're not.

671
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:18,175
Coming in here.

672
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:18,942
For something.

673
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:22,613
You probably work 70 oh.

674
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:23,847
Oh going, Mrs.

675
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:24,782
Hogan.

676
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:27,317
Oh, a lot about you.

677
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:29,386
I'll take your.

678
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:31,522
A pleasure.

679
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:32,923
How long is helpful?

680
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:37,194
I'm just passing through and you talk to
some corpses south of Nesmith.

681
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:41,331
Oh, I was going to get washed up.

682
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:44,635
But we have a cure to Goose.
And I gathered.

683
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,870
Some pickled berries. Moved me.

684
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:52,910
I was making yoga.

685
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,812
So how long have you two. Going on here?

686
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:58,415
Does she make you happy?

687
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:00,417
Happier than I did

688
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,653
before.
I mean. Well, I'll put it this way.

689
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:03,387
She makes her living.

690
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:08,625
Honestly, She doesn't drink herself silly.

691
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:12,796
And she doesn't make me weep
in the small hours wondering where she is.

692
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,232
I was in pain.

693
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:17,868
I was banished from my damn tribe
to be with you.

694
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:23,273
And I tried to build us a home
so you could forget that.

695
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:28,078
But you never could.

696
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:30,480
Gwen seems lovely.

697
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:32,649
You deserve that.

698
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,518
Thank you.

699
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:39,556
You know, when you left, I lost my family.

700
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:43,927
I've been fortunate enough
to find another.

701
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:47,865
And I wish nothing less than that for you.

702
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:51,134
Well, that's sweet.

703
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,002
Although

704
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,553
we're going to take down Fortune,

705
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,921
I'm going to show Marlon.

706
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:13,423
He'll try to let me go

707
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:33,176
on. For

708
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,045
God's sake.

709
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:38,282
I come close to being

710
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,754
true, crude

711
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:44,655
and sweet.

712
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:49,459
That's say good and we do free

713
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:52,896
will and true in.

714
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,365
A way, for inside

715
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:57,467
the store before you.

716
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:02,906
From we go

717
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:05,042
round the store

718
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:32,135
for you.

719
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,739
So many of my children gave their lives.

720
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,207
The battle here

721
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:39,810
always imagine

722
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,845
they will bring in sacred ground
like this.

723
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:52,589
Here will going to shovel.

724
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:55,225
Okay, Simon, how does this work?

725
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:58,195
I read the temptation on this clerics
to teach

726
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,031
somewhere that

727
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:03,967
right once the dead man is revived, lost

728
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:07,904
in five questions at which point you die,
don't never to be re revived.

729
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:09,573
My five questions.

730
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:11,975
I don't know how it works.
Seems arbitrary.

731
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:13,110
You know.

732
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:23,687
This delightful

733
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:34,398
experiment that got this

734
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,200
baby.

735
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:37,868
I'm not saying

736
00:50:42,672 --> 00:50:42,906
it was.

737
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:43,407
It scared me.

738
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:46,243
This started.

739
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:48,779
Here we go.

740
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:52,249
Where you kill the values is great.

741
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:53,517
I mean,

742
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:55,719
not for you.

743
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:56,820
I'm sorry for your loss.

744
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,356
The question, right? Yes.

745
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:03,727
No, it wasn't for you to
kill is a question. Yes.

746
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:08,165
It only answer when I talk.

747
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:10,333
Okay. And what did you say?

748
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:10,801
Okay.

749
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:14,137
At the end of that, I did shoot, man.

750
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:17,007
Fantastic. Here's the shovel

751
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:24,181
that took our breath

752
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:27,284
during the battle.

753
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:29,853
Did you see the helmet of destruction?

754
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:32,689
He was in possession of my chief Stone.

755
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:36,059
Not grip would not make good.

756
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:38,862
Would it stay in our group of do with. It

757
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:44,668
The competition for the rich.

758
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:46,736
Good advantage

759
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:47,838
against the dragon.

760
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:48,672
Break

761
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:04,254
tactics

762
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:09,860
on both.

763
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,963
That's the last thing I remember

764
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:15,599
coming

765
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:19,836
out. Thanks for your help.

766
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:23,406
Let's
go look for standard was great going on.

767
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,076
They go watch girls, ask them questions.

768
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,612
Ask them what? Here
you feel something? You know.

769
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:29,813
Well, you can't just leave him like that.

770
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,314
Look at the cover.

771
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:38,021
Of I was the coach.

772
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:39,856
No party.

773
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:42,325
He's not part.

774
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,793
You like cats?

775
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:46,563
Not really. Okay.

776
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:50,167
What's to pursue about him.

777
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,068
If feel better, do.

778
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,272
Often times

779
00:52:55,272 --> 00:53:00,744
at least this decision leave
can take this wind retreat.

780
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:02,913
I assume the order

781
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:07,117
I come out to my back walk

782
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,619
home is the right When the sun is.

783
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,557
Just beginning to reach. God.

784
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,996
There was a little bit of the battle

785
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:28,405
from the start.

786
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:30,106
And then you went into the battle?

787
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:33,210
No, I died from the fall

788
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:36,580
when Standard Remote City
gave the home to themselves.

789
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,314
And that's here, wasn't it?

790
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,051
On standing side of the fence?

791
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:42,519
Well, drove off.

792
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,754
This is a nightmare.

793
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:46,223
Hello, Roy?

794
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:51,661
I was wounded and and lost my hopes
as I escaped.

795
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:53,263
To the field of battle.

796
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:55,298
I didn't care about myself.

797
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:55,932
I just needed to.

798
00:53:55,932 --> 00:54:07,244
Keep the helmet safe.

799
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,612
It was the same.

800
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:11,881
But the mark of this time

801
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,253
I waited for the killing.

802
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,455
But it never came.

803
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,358
He had a kind word.

804
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,393
He told me his name was done

805
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:26,496
in flames as time and now lived in exile.

806
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:30,233
As I die,
he promised to keep the helmet safe

807
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:33,403
and for some reason I believed him.

808
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:34,604
You're joking.

809
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:36,306
The kind of thing I speak.

810
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:41,177
Truth is, because you a fan, lied
and you died for nothing.

811
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:43,680
If the helmets and dead end
want to find another way. To the world?

812
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:45,649
No. I've heard of Zack.

813
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:46,383
He's a paladin.

814
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:49,286
He'll be unclothed to clouds to tell us.
I know the name as well.

815
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:52,789
My uncle said Sake fended off
the beholder, using only a sharp and God.

816
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:57,160
Sharp and got something from the fans
or murders.

817
00:54:57,761 --> 00:55:01,364
End of story.

818
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:05,101
But I've heard of him to know
he fought with my cousin.

819
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,903
Leonora says he's a good man.

820
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:11,007
Well, you can all go find this lovely
thank and braid each other's hair.

821
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:14,844
I'll find another way.

822
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:15,879
What's his problem?

823
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:18,348
He's got a history with the fans.

824
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,250
I know. How you feeling?

825
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:24,821
But we're running out of time.

826
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,723
It turns out.

827
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:29,859
I would be doing it to save her in here.

828
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:32,429
If Zinke turns out to

829
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:34,531
be a break,
I split them right down the middle.

830
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:36,099
It's free.

831
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:42,405
So what have we got to lose?

832
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:44,507
Anyone more stupid? Zinke has.

833
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,609
Last I heard,
he was working with Harper's anymore.

834
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:48,345
But she. Great.

835
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:52,549
Harper's just come with ripples of history
with that, too.

836
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,451
All right, let's go.

837
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:56,786
Excuse me.

838
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,155
I'm still alive.

839
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:03,059
I. What's your favorite bug

840
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:04,861
contracted?

841
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,129
Just one

842
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:07,697
question.

843
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,367
I helped got to historical works.

844
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:15,638
I'd say the frontal lobe of light
comes first job.

845
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:18,541
That was only the fourth question.

846
00:56:18,541 --> 00:57:21,671
Hello.

847
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:23,072
Let's more interesting.

848
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:35,552
And you know.

849
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:39,088
Zach, is it? It doesn't query.

850
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:41,391
I prefer not to answer
without knowing to whom I was speaking.

851
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,626
And hold the killjoy.

852
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:47,831
This is Simon at dawn.

853
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:49,933
Who brings it? Baldwin Sure. You do.

854
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:51,701
We're trying to

855
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:53,803
find the helmet
of dysfunction, destruction.

856
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:57,674
Many lives are lost
in defense of that home to speak of.

857
00:57:57,674 --> 00:58:05,682
It would be to diminish the sacrifice.

858
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:06,583
James is the.

859
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:08,184
As well against.

860
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:15,425
Those as a man of honor and integrity, and

861
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:19,496
I can assure you are reasons for wanting
the helmets are entirely noble.

862
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:21,798
You can rob. Hogan

863
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:25,068
not just anyone watch Fitzwilliam

864
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:27,537
the with today's.

865
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:35,245
Come with Me.

866
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:37,313
What is this place?

867
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:40,149
A Harper sanctuary.

868
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:44,020
Surely Alfred friend already knew that.

869
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,488
I didn't know Harper.

870
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:48,658
You made the first one Your house

871
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:52,195
as your oath hasn't for a you.

872
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,964
Just because that sentence is symmetrical
doesn't make it not nonsense.

873
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:57,600
What? He was so rough as when he stole.

874
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,802
I can store to them
a great deal of treasure from us.

875
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:00,403
Also.

876
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:02,572
It's, however you went
and it doesn't even know that.

877
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:04,507
What it was.

878
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,743
In other words,
Forge is a real son of a bitch.

879
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,945
So you blame his
mother for his corruption?

880
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,515
No, it's an expression.

881
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:14,584
I see. I don't know.

882
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:16,986
Traffic and colloquialisms.

883
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:19,422
You know, a lot of fun. Are you?

884
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:21,424
Is this what he was
truly allied with? The Red Wizard.

885
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:23,626
Their intentions
must go beyond the madness

886
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,763
of research and codes of excellence.

887
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:30,867
Assassins have as little babies
or kids rule the nation as they during

888
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:34,003
the time as long as power was absolutely

889
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:38,408
on the eve, the residents of the castle.

890
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:41,344
Gathered for a celebration

891
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,017
of the most

892
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:51,788
time had plan

893
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:56,426
to stage an unholy coup

894
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:22,752
to unleash

895
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:26,122
the spell that we can see

896
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,391
from our liberty.

897
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:31,427
It will reign

898
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:34,530
with its time
created, the army of the young

899
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:42,105
allowing it to conquer the entire nation.

900
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:43,773
So power stands no farther than the.

901
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,274
Borders of day.

902
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:46,342
I suspect he and his red

903
01:00:46,342 --> 01:00:48,277
Wizards will not be content
until they have infected

904
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:50,847
the whole assailant with them
that he died.

905
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,216
Because we already know
that Britain was Japan.

906
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:54,450
And so forth.

907
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:56,853
The question remains
that they helped him to take power.

908
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:58,254
What do they stand to gain?

909
01:00:58,254 --> 01:01:00,056
Sounds like we have a common enemy.

910
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:02,125
You keep us at home
and we take forced down.

911
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,427
No one stays more defense force
you to back them up.

912
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:06,696
And the red wizards lose the puppet.

913
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:09,098
What will become of the wealthy? Burgle?

914
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:10,133
What does that matter?

915
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:12,969
I will not be complicit
in the illicit use of ill gotten booty

916
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:15,738
five.

917
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:17,707
If I didn't once the townspeople.

918
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:19,909
Swear to it. Right.

919
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:21,277
Place your hand on this office

920
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:24,814
seal and swear that you will indeed
distribute all the wealth you take.

921
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:27,417
Amongst the people of Neverwinter.

922
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:33,423
Sure.

923
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:34,957
Go on and.

924
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:39,062
Promise you'll give it to people.

925
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:45,635
Who give fortunes.

926
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:48,071
But these people never land.

927
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:50,640
Keep this.

928
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,809
You may not yet believe your words.

929
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:54,277
But I do

930
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:56,779
confirm.

931
01:01:56,779 --> 01:02:00,183
Some woman who now wears the helmet.

932
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:01,751
In the bowels of the. Underdog.

933
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:03,853
The underdog trying to keep it safe.

934
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:05,121
Why would you put it down there?

935
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:07,557
It is the last place that anyone
who values their life would go.

936
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:10,293
It's lovely and quite the opposite.

937
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:12,595
I know I was being ironic.

938
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:13,696
I find irony as a player.

939
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:16,532
The who wields it. Most, especially young.

940
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,568
So what you find saying.

941
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:21,270
There is an emphasis to the Sword.

942
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:24,373
Mountains in the Coast Guard and forest
from which we may descend

943
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:27,610
to Melbourne.

944
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:33,983
Maybe it's a bold policy
to announce to this.

945
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:36,719
You know her got my wife killed.

946
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:39,422
So there was silence.

947
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:41,357
I'm Justice fans.

948
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:43,893
You mean.

949
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:46,262
No offense and not on the level

950
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:48,397
I was.

951
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:50,133
A boy wants us to seize control.

952
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:51,234
This thing

953
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:56,239
I saw first hand or is the spell

954
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,510
honorable meant to us

955
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:01,010
mines?

956
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,745
What do we leave

957
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:13,623
there?

958
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:27,537
Oh, I.

959
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:31,107
Escaped alive.

960
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,442
But forever changed.

961
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:34,610
You and I both.

962
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:37,180
Lost a part of ourselves.

963
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,448
All that matters is what we do
with what remains.

964
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:41,784
I told you what I'm going to.

965
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:43,386
Do to break into Castle and get.

966
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:45,421
My family back.

967
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:48,324
The travelers
going to resurrect the life. Yeah,

968
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,027
they will.

969
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:55,198
But only ask you to consider
that this plan we call life one of many.

970
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:58,234
Huh? Drag your ladylove back to Romans.

971
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,770
So the driver of my new.

972
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:11,848
Someone else right next to this guy.

973
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:14,317
Follow me at your office

974
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:21,190
through the orifice.

975
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:24,627
The underdog has many instances

976
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:27,430
this this lesson

977
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:32,802
speeches.

978
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:36,439
The war

979
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:37,707
of the last.

980
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:40,176
Days.

981
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:42,912
Truck shows the path to avoid problems.

982
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:45,681
Stay close and quiet.

983
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:51,254
Let me know that this place
is only a fraction of its true danger.

984
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:52,021
Should the way become.

985
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:52,922
Forget

986
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:59,462
me, Take my hand and the bleeding.

987
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:00,062
I'll tell you right.

988
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:02,765
Now I'm going to take hand

989
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:15,678
because I know first this guy.

990
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:20,049
You know he's helping us.

991
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:20,716
It's something.

992
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:23,953
Obviously everything on
my sleeve is my arm.

993
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:25,988
To your back.

994
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:43,205
I hear that as well.

995
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:44,440
After the ruins just

996
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:55,117
you still

997
01:05:58,321 --> 01:05:59,989
rocking on things.

998
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:02,091
Amid the virus, swarms, formidable

999
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:06,262
targets seem to take control of the body,

1000
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:09,332
which we do because our

1001
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:12,435
metro in the middle of the table

1002
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:15,237
and it doesn't seem very likely

1003
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:33,489
they are to strike.

1004
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:35,658
Well, that's a hurtful

1005
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:36,892
theory.

1006
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:37,860
Things

1007
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:41,464
don't.

1008
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:43,733
The helmet lies on the far
side of this chasm.

1009
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:48,437
But be warned,
the bridge is protected by nature.

1010
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:48,938
No, Mr.

1011
01:06:48,938 --> 01:06:52,041
Trump,
there was a place formula with this voice.

1012
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:53,576
I will not trigger the mechanism.

1013
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:56,412
What's the formula? It's quite simple.

1014
01:06:56,412 --> 01:07:00,483
Tells you that the city is slowly
moving forward with each step, except.

1015
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:02,518
For this step.
Which would be a lateral move.

1016
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:04,387
Left or right, it says no.

1017
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:09,425
So as the leader in the make it remain
equidistant to proceed again on the

1018
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:13,262
however at the midpoint of interesting
even numbered blocks, they

1019
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,830
previously, no matter what

1020
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:28,978
I may have

1021
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:32,515
put my foot on the bridge

1022
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:37,653
and realizes where I started.

1023
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:45,694
So sorry.

1024
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:49,832
It's not very structurally sound.

1025
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:50,866
It's just magic.

1026
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:52,301
It's a cross

1027
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:56,338
of telekinesis.

1028
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:58,707
I've got some rope in my bag.

1029
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:01,243
I can tie it. Yes,
without asking to cross.

1030
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:02,711
So it sticks to the rock.

1031
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:04,647
You know, rocks part, right?

1032
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:05,514
Sure.

1033
01:08:06,348 --> 01:08:07,783
What did you get that.

1034
01:08:09,452 --> 01:08:10,653
Means walking stick.

1035
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:12,721
Is way from.
A wizard over in the right place.

1036
01:08:13,022 --> 01:08:16,725
It's not a weakness.

1037
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:17,226
It's a hit.

1038
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:20,329
Then the stuff. Of want to run fucking.

1039
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:21,931
You got to

1040
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:26,368
watch the.

1041
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:30,106
The one

1042
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:35,077
like.

1043
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:43,319
We need the brains.

1044
01:08:43,319 --> 01:09:19,989
Oh, you

1045
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:26,061
just they give you now just do it.

1046
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:29,165
You protect protected with your very life.

1047
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,767
I will. You

1048
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:32,801
solve this

1049
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:40,276
yours easily and

1050
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:52,221
I suppose

1051
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:54,790
in this

1052
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:57,693
case you

1053
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:02,364
do not doubt

1054
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:19,682
they are the behalf of

1055
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:42,605
the CIA

1056
01:10:46,842 --> 01:10:58,687
for you.

1057
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:18,841
You prove this

1058
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:46,769
through you.

1059
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:51,840
I can.

1060
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,443
Sleep. Why?

1061
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:57,413
Killing us is no simple feat to kill that
which is already

1062
01:11:57,413 --> 01:12:02,418
dead.

1063
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:03,519
Mankind

1064
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:48,130
is this

1065
01:12:58,507 --> 01:13:00,542
hungry Dragon stammers.

1066
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:03,345
It was to found that you did, he

1067
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:04,847
the last one.

1068
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:47,856
Before to

1069
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:31,093
go. Thanks for that.

1070
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:36,298
You've done the same to me.

1071
01:15:36,298 --> 01:16:01,256
No, you

1072
01:16:07,029 --> 01:16:11,033
I can see what you to

1073
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:17,839
cry more now.

1074
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:21,476
The fright night may go on for you

1075
01:16:27,282 --> 01:16:27,916
right

1076
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:31,820
What you have

1077
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:38,961
go on for

1078
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:26,475
Oh. I leave you

1079
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:29,044
every success that you just.

1080
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:33,181
And I come with the I Good.

1081
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:34,950
This is your quest.

1082
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:37,419
I have given you the tools.

1083
01:17:37,419 --> 01:17:38,987
You supervise the.

1084
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:43,392
Coach, utilize them for us because you're
much better advantage in strategy.

1085
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:44,359
Pretty much everything.

1086
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:47,763
But we're talking.

1087
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:48,630
Talking to you is a great.

1088
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:54,002
In those instances when face weighed down

1089
01:17:55,037 --> 01:17:57,239
a record tennis at the age silk.

1090
01:17:58,106 --> 01:18:14,156
Ceiling.

1091
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:18,226
There he goes.

1092
01:18:18,226 --> 01:18:19,061
Wondering

1093
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:21,630
what's in such a.

1094
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:23,598
Straight line.

1095
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:26,468
No. Anyway, he's coming up on a rock.

1096
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:29,071
Is it going to go round? No.

1097
01:18:30,338 --> 01:18:44,586
Or I'm going to hit you like that.

1098
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,154
Useless.

1099
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:50,092
That's a lot of pressure
given only one to get it.

1100
01:18:50,492 --> 01:18:54,229
Yeah, I realize that.

1101
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:57,933
So entire feet wrestling, you.

1102
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:23,325
Move very use the.

1103
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:26,495
So I also.

1104
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:31,433
Descended from the wizarding world
you know

1105
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:35,971
when I was a about

1106
01:19:37,906 --> 01:19:42,711
my great great grandfather.

1107
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:44,746
That's quite.

1108
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:46,381
What makes you think.

1109
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:48,984
You're worthy.

1110
01:19:48,984 --> 01:19:54,790
I believe myself, you know, I'm sure I'm.

1111
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:55,590
A grateful for.

1112
01:19:55,590 --> 01:20:00,362
Your fully thinking about magic.

1113
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:03,231
It chooses.

1114
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:07,602
It doesn't have to suffer fools or you.

1115
01:20:07,602 --> 01:20:09,437
That's okay. Thank you.

1116
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:15,177
So I'm. If

1117
01:20:16,444 --> 01:20:18,013
you told me that.

1118
01:20:18,213 --> 01:20:21,750
Okay.

1119
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:23,318
What happened?

1120
01:20:23,785 --> 01:20:26,188
I spoke to someone.

1121
01:20:26,254 --> 01:20:26,822
Yeah.

1122
01:20:27,355 --> 01:20:30,625
My great great grandfather was

1123
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:31,560
unhelpful.

1124
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,695
He spoke to from here.

1125
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:35,864
So I have to say good for them.

1126
01:20:35,864 --> 01:20:36,464
Most of the time.

1127
01:20:36,464 --> 01:20:39,167
Most of the.

1128
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:40,302
I'll try to converse.

1129
01:20:40,302 --> 01:20:40,769
Great.

1130
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:43,638
We'll try it.

1131
01:20:43,638 --> 01:20:44,339
You got this.

1132
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:52,614
You got your inventor in.

1133
01:20:52,714 --> 01:20:55,917
It applies for sick with it in 6 hours
to relieve

1134
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:58,954
itself. I never get my family back.

1135
01:20:58,954 --> 01:20:59,988
It really.

1136
01:21:19,941 --> 01:21:20,742
Is significant.

1137
01:21:20,742 --> 01:21:22,611
Coal power.

1138
01:21:22,611 --> 01:21:25,247
You're a man to

1139
01:21:25,647 --> 01:21:26,314
handle it.

1140
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:29,251
No, no.

1141
01:21:29,251 --> 01:21:32,821
I've got this kid.

1142
01:21:33,989 --> 01:21:35,690
And you want to be a lover.

1143
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:42,697
Right?

1144
01:21:42,697 --> 01:21:46,902
Damn, Tom.

1145
01:21:47,035 --> 01:21:48,837
Trying to capture.

1146
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:56,378
You Just have to let it go.

1147
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:58,713
You've heard.

1148
01:21:58,713 --> 01:22:00,849
We've got a problem.

1149
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:02,117
I can't do it

1150
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:03,551
down.

1151
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:09,424
Been at it for hours I call you pass your
busted set up, you know, up the truck.

1152
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:10,992
What's the racket?

1153
01:22:10,992 --> 01:22:14,129
Hey, he's having a little trouble
with the help. Man.

1154
01:22:14,162 --> 01:22:15,897
Simon, just do it.

1155
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:18,033
Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah, Thanks.

1156
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:21,736
Okay, I'll just do it exactly what I told
you would have go back to the topic,

1157
01:22:21,736 --> 01:22:23,338
but you wouldn't listen.

1158
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:23,705
What do you mean?

1159
01:22:23,705 --> 01:22:25,273
You told him?

1160
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:27,709
He said to keep it between us for morale.

1161
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:28,977
I don't know why.

1162
01:22:28,977 --> 01:22:31,413
Because he is the most pigheaded person
I've ever known.

1163
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:33,481
You talk us into doing things.

1164
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:36,318
You know, the work, and then you blame us
when it goes pear shaped.

1165
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:37,052
You cannot it.

1166
01:22:37,052 --> 01:22:39,587
To figure out a plan B. Plan B.

1167
01:22:39,587 --> 01:22:40,822
We dug up my family.

1168
01:22:40,822 --> 01:22:42,691
We went to the dance for that moment.

1169
01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:45,460
And you knew the whole time
that he couldn't using you

1170
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:47,329
humans, you just can't help but lie.

1171
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:49,531
I didn't lie. I really thought so.

1172
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:50,398
You guys.

1173
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:53,001
Look, we got a couple of hours
till the games begin.

1174
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:54,202
This is what we do.

1175
01:22:54,202 --> 01:22:57,872
We pivot instead of dwelling on
what went wrong, who lied, who.

1176
01:22:57,872 --> 01:23:00,008
Let's put our heads together,
figure out a plan.

1177
01:23:00,342 --> 01:23:02,610
I'm going to figure out my way home.

1178
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:04,446
I can't believe I put my faith
in any of you.

1179
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:05,981
Yeah, I'm going to.

1180
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:10,085
Sorry about Kira.

1181
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:12,420
Find another way to get her.
Just not today.

1182
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:13,922
It has to be today.

1183
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:15,790
We're not done until my daughter's safe.

1184
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:17,292
Not just sick of failing.

1185
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:19,027
No, that's the whole point.

1186
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:21,629
We must never stop failing,
because the minute we do,

1187
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:24,833
we failed.

1188
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:29,938
Oh, look, none of us here can say our
lives have gone the way we'd hoped for it.

1189
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:31,673
Right.

1190
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:35,744
Olga, you left your tribe with the man.

1191
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:39,014
Left you because you were so upset
about leaving your tribe.

1192
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:42,450
And if you put. No, that's in stone.

1193
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:44,219
Shame on you, Simon.

1194
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:46,921
You're a petty thief masquerading as a
your sorcerer.

1195
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:48,590
You get to go back to your show.

1196
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:50,258
It's better than dying.

1197
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:52,360
It's worse. Things do work.

1198
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:53,962
You have integrity.

1199
01:23:53,962 --> 01:23:54,796
I was sure.

1200
01:23:54,796 --> 01:23:57,032
The last thing you want to do
is tell the old man

1201
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:59,300
that you had a chance to say,
but you walked away.

1202
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:00,769
You quick to call us failures.

1203
01:24:00,769 --> 01:24:03,271
What about you and me?

1204
01:24:03,271 --> 01:24:06,174
I'm the champion of failures.

1205
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:08,043
I lost everything
that ever mattered to me.

1206
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:15,383
It was all my fault.

1207
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:15,850
One of them.

1208
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:20,455
Really killed my wife.

1209
01:24:20,455 --> 01:24:21,156
I didn't.

1210
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:23,992
I decided

1211
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:28,930
we deserved a better life
than our results will allow us.

1212
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:31,099
But I didn't know
the Red Wizards mark their treasure

1213
01:24:34,135 --> 01:24:34,702
and let

1214
01:24:34,702 --> 01:24:38,873
them right to our door.

1215
01:24:38,873 --> 01:24:43,711
I didn't even have the good luck
to be home when they got there.

1216
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:44,746
Failed the Harpers. That failed.

1217
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:46,714
My family failed all of you.

1218
01:24:46,714 --> 01:24:48,716
Which is exactly why I can't quit.

1219
01:24:48,716 --> 01:24:51,219
So if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to sit on this rock.

1220
01:24:52,554 --> 01:25:05,400
Make a plan, go

1221
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:43,338
through.

1222
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:48,676
What's it to put this over?

1223
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:50,311
How about this?

1224
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:53,581
We use the hitters in their stuff
to get into the vault.

1225
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:55,016
He's buying that.

1226
01:25:55,016 --> 01:25:58,219
You can't. His assistant.
That's not saying.

1227
01:25:58,419 --> 01:26:01,055
I'm saying we put the point along some

1228
01:26:01,356 --> 01:26:04,959
and then sneak that Zeke to the vault.

1229
01:26:04,959 --> 01:26:07,162
The only thing going in
that vault is treasure.

1230
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:12,500
So we put the portal on some treasure.

1231
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:12,901
Say the.

1232
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:14,169
Richest man and. Boulders came.

1233
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:16,137
One or two people
bringing loot to the city

1234
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:19,040
of traveling the high road.

1235
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,842
When you catch one of their convoys, it.

1236
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:22,410
Could be dozens of guard.

1237
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:25,680
The guards be guarding against people,
taking things out of the wagon

1238
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,415
for putting them in.

1239
01:26:27,415 --> 01:26:38,526
You guess you tried to

1240
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:44,192
do your.

1241
01:27:44,192 --> 01:27:48,096
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

1242
01:28:37,845 --> 01:28:58,032
oh oh.

1243
01:28:58,032 --> 01:29:02,637
What a profound joy it is to welcome you

1244
01:29:04,372 --> 01:29:08,309
to the wind tunnel, to the river, to

1245
01:29:12,213 --> 01:29:21,723
the roof.

1246
01:29:21,723 --> 01:29:23,891
I can't believe

1247
01:29:24,058 --> 01:29:28,596
I lost my factory.

1248
01:29:29,263 --> 01:29:30,264
Who will?

1249
01:29:30,264 --> 01:29:37,372
The next stage,
Please Do not be in the arena

1250
01:29:37,438 --> 01:29:41,342
with the gates.

1251
01:29:41,342 --> 01:29:44,212
Give me

1252
01:29:51,018 --> 01:29:51,486
enough.

1253
01:29:51,919 --> 01:30:08,636
This is absolutely my.

1254
01:30:08,636 --> 01:30:10,438
Now what happened?

1255
01:30:10,438 --> 01:30:11,439
It's facing the floor.

1256
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:18,379
What were they stored that way? Oh.

1257
01:30:20,481 --> 01:30:21,582
Boy, is nothing. Go away.

1258
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:25,119
Let me try to put the cap.

1259
01:30:25,119 --> 01:30:26,621
Get started

1260
01:30:27,588 --> 01:30:29,157
rolling, Quincy.

1261
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:30,825
Oh, that's what.

1262
01:30:30,825 --> 01:30:31,793
Plan C is.

1263
01:30:31,793 --> 01:30:34,862
We go back to plan
A, You're going to two in the helmet.

1264
01:30:34,896 --> 01:30:37,532
Why don't you just call it Plan
A? It is a. Security.

1265
01:30:37,832 --> 01:30:39,767
You know damn well I can't attend to that.

1266
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:41,068
That's not true.

1267
01:30:41,068 --> 01:30:42,737
You couldn't attend to Look at me.

1268
01:30:42,737 --> 01:30:43,404
Look at me.

1269
01:30:43,404 --> 01:30:45,807
Oh, you remove that job allowed water.

1270
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:49,277
You couldn't spider
climb it until job is darker.

1271
01:30:49,844 --> 01:30:53,214
And when we drop the spear of ale fizzing,
your stones can spell filled

1272
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:54,715
until the arrows were inches away.

1273
01:30:54,715 --> 01:30:58,352
Even tried to foot
the gravity of old theater.

1274
01:30:59,053 --> 01:30:59,520
You did.

1275
01:31:01,322 --> 01:31:02,089
By accident.

1276
01:31:02,089 --> 01:31:04,592
It was wild magic. And that only happened
because they were going to kill it.

1277
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:05,927
Exactly.

1278
01:31:06,694 --> 01:31:10,898
Look, you were at your strongest
when you think you're at your weakest,

1279
01:31:11,599 --> 01:31:14,869
but you deliver.

1280
01:31:14,869 --> 01:31:17,038
You're going to get into that vault, okay?

1281
01:31:17,972 --> 01:31:21,209
Because he can.

1282
01:31:21,209 --> 01:31:23,044
But because you must.

1283
01:31:23,611 --> 01:31:25,446
I'm going to keep chipping away.

1284
01:31:25,446 --> 01:31:27,949
If I can get a quarter inch,
you'll be able to squeeze through as warm.

1285
01:31:28,182 --> 01:31:29,517
As a worm.

1286
01:31:29,717 --> 01:31:30,985
It's a worm. Perfect.

1287
01:31:30,985 --> 01:31:31,652
You see this?

1288
01:31:31,652 --> 01:31:33,621
Now we have a plan B, A plan C fails.

1289
01:31:33,621 --> 01:31:35,456
In plan D, Just plan B. Again.

1290
01:31:35,456 --> 01:31:37,558
PLAYBILL'S Instinctive. It all sticks.

1291
01:31:38,459 --> 01:31:40,761
Here is the skipping contact.

1292
01:31:42,029 --> 01:31:43,831
Well, this is a rock.

1293
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:46,167
Actually, it is a 77,

1294
01:31:47,034 --> 01:31:50,304
but the only workaround is.

1295
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,809
Okay, so how are we going to make.

1296
01:31:54,809 --> 01:31:58,045
He's just create abstraction.

1297
01:31:58,045 --> 01:31:59,547
I can see.

1298
01:32:14,262 --> 01:32:16,430
What's your business here.

1299
01:32:16,731 --> 01:32:20,234
That I will be his friends become lovers.

1300
01:32:20,401 --> 01:32:23,137
So embrace more all of a sudden.

1301
01:32:23,137 --> 01:32:26,340
That's what it is now.

1302
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:29,777
All right well that's an upgrade

1303
01:32:29,777 --> 01:32:34,749
allows is and that's where a woman intends
is now life good friend

1304
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:38,152
Brett Larson an upgrade last

1305
01:32:38,686 --> 01:32:41,923
an upgrade is an upgrade last Larson.

1306
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:46,093
Which introduced

1307
01:32:46,093 --> 01:32:50,364
great great great great great
great great great great great great

1308
01:32:50,531 --> 01:32:57,238
great great.

1309
01:32:57,238 --> 01:32:59,807
The things are starting to get.

1310
01:33:02,376 --> 01:33:06,614
Good that. Is.

1311
01:33:12,453 --> 01:33:15,022
Some of the critical thing.

1312
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:17,925
Sure. That there

1313
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:19,360
will be.

1314
01:33:31,539 --> 01:33:36,277
Kind of shortcut,

1315
01:33:36,277 --> 01:34:13,214
you know, Improvization.

1316
01:34:13,381 --> 01:34:13,748
Council.

1317
01:34:13,748 --> 01:34:15,549
I think I'm just gonna.

1318
01:34:25,693 --> 01:35:00,628
Do that up.

1319
01:35:00,628 --> 01:35:21,315
But how long

1320
01:35:26,020 --> 01:35:28,589
this rocks is.

1321
01:35:28,589 --> 01:35:36,430
Very goes back That would be so.

1322
01:35:36,664 --> 01:35:39,900
I don't have time for this
all the time there is

1323
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:42,603
it would go to die if I tell it too.

1324
01:35:42,603 --> 01:35:45,673
So you die a few minutes
until you give us one.

1325
01:35:45,706 --> 01:35:46,807
That's enough.

1326
01:35:46,807 --> 01:35:47,742
You don't know me.

1327
01:35:47,742 --> 01:35:49,477
I know you're a suspect.

1328
01:35:49,477 --> 01:35:51,579
And your family name? Just with my name.

1329
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:55,916
That means you know why you don't know
if you had your time.

1330
01:35:56,517 --> 01:35:58,085
Knows my time.

1331
01:35:58,085 --> 01:36:01,989
I'm going to have to.

1332
01:36:01,989 --> 01:36:02,356
Sorry

1333
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:18,239
for you. You

1334
01:36:25,379 --> 01:36:29,483
so what?

1335
01:36:29,850 --> 01:36:31,152
I did it.

1336
01:36:31,152 --> 01:36:31,852
Well done.

1337
01:36:31,852 --> 01:36:35,156
Move as it was just me holding you back.

1338
01:36:35,356 --> 01:36:45,633
That's what I would say.

1339
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:47,835
Made it insightful to

1340
01:36:49,537 --> 01:36:51,705
just nothing you

1341
01:36:52,039 --> 01:36:54,141
so you value.

1342
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:55,709
Well, you.

1343
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:58,579
Think I'm under the arena.

1344
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:14,461
For you? Him.

1345
01:37:14,461 --> 01:37:20,367
You know,

1346
01:37:20,367 --> 01:37:20,768
that's

1347
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:31,412
some talk.

1348
01:37:31,412 --> 01:37:34,615
You there? What are you doing here?

1349
01:37:34,615 --> 01:37:37,952
You're.

1350
01:37:37,952 --> 01:37:40,020
I came for you. We have to go.

1351
01:37:41,589 --> 01:37:43,123
He likes to be.

1352
01:37:43,123 --> 01:37:43,891
No, no.

1353
01:37:43,891 --> 01:37:46,861
I know
you think I'm a liar and a bad father, but

1354
01:37:51,565 --> 01:37:55,569
I'm a grandfather.

1355
01:37:55,569 --> 01:37:59,073
And I didn't leave you.

1356
01:37:59,073 --> 01:38:00,875
And I wasn't trying to bring your mom
back.

1357
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:02,443
I was trying to

1358
01:38:03,143 --> 01:38:06,013
bring my wife back,

1359
01:38:06,013 --> 01:38:08,682
which is
maybe if you got a chance to know her

1360
01:38:10,117 --> 01:38:12,453
and love her, like,
I need you to understand.

1361
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:16,023
But if you come with me, you can have

1362
01:38:16,023 --> 01:38:23,163
that chance. You

1363
01:38:40,347 --> 01:38:41,248
think you'll be able to.

1364
01:38:41,248 --> 01:38:44,251
Distinguish between your own daughter
and a 300 year old wizard?

1365
01:38:45,019 --> 01:38:46,887
They're like, You're safe. I'm like, This.

1366
01:38:46,887 --> 01:38:48,255
Got no idea you were coming.

1367
01:38:48,255 --> 01:38:53,961
I don't think she knows how tenacious
you become.

1368
01:38:53,961 --> 01:38:58,299
And I'm

1369
01:38:58,299 --> 01:39:01,735
really sorry about the way you were gonna

1370
01:39:01,735 --> 01:39:02,102
think.

1371
01:39:02,102 --> 01:39:06,707
If you were truly honest, you'd have to
admit I can give care a better life.

1372
01:39:08,042 --> 01:39:11,378
I think you can take comfort in knowing
that she's with the father she deserves.

1373
01:39:12,579 --> 01:39:14,882
Now I'm in a pickle with this.

1374
01:39:14,882 --> 01:39:17,551
I don't want to die.

1375
01:39:18,118 --> 01:39:20,020
Which is why

1376
01:39:20,187 --> 01:39:23,190
I'm going to leave the rock. Huh?

1377
01:39:25,726 --> 01:39:38,205
Oh, you're going to lose dignity
with him in prison.

1378
01:39:38,205 --> 01:39:40,741
I think it's Give us a fighting chance.

1379
01:39:41,075 --> 01:39:43,310
That's not a chance. Got a chance at all.

1380
01:39:43,844 --> 01:39:46,413
I mean, even if you survive tournament.

1381
01:39:46,413 --> 01:39:49,850
Subpoenas, this will

1382
01:39:51,151 --> 01:39:52,286
be. Much, much

1383
01:39:52,286 --> 01:39:55,289
better for you to die in of the games.

1384
01:39:55,356 --> 01:39:58,993
No, they defeated you

1385
01:39:58,993 --> 01:40:01,495
at the fight in the arena.

1386
01:40:01,495 --> 01:40:14,074
But you might want to sleep

1387
01:40:16,276 --> 01:40:19,947
in the arena.

1388
01:40:19,947 --> 01:40:21,949
This still me, Tom Ford putting us in the.

1389
01:40:21,949 --> 01:40:22,950
Games, dummy.

1390
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:25,185
I saved their lives and I got rid of them.

1391
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:28,856
We're going to the transport system
to suspect this and I would agree to this.

1392
01:40:28,856 --> 01:40:33,160
I just have a plan, something
to do with the part of the arena where you

1393
01:40:34,661 --> 01:40:35,629
you remember

1394
01:40:36,764 --> 01:40:37,898
not. Sure.

1395
01:40:39,133 --> 01:40:41,101
There was a dock down there.

1396
01:40:41,101 --> 01:40:45,873
I saw guards
loading everything onto a ship.

1397
01:40:45,873 --> 01:40:46,640
The ship.

1398
01:40:48,175 --> 01:40:49,676
Course was I.

1399
01:40:49,810 --> 01:40:53,213
Was stealing it for
if care about being brought to.

1400
01:40:53,213 --> 01:40:57,051
Get access to the vault, it was to brought
back the danger to take the bigger.

1401
01:40:59,019 --> 01:41:00,320
Punk hero.

1402
01:41:01,922 --> 01:41:03,323
Behind. We have to get to that.

1403
01:41:03,323 --> 01:41:04,558
But what I don't understand.

1404
01:41:04,558 --> 01:41:21,241
Is for just leaving what to go?

1405
01:41:21,241 --> 01:41:25,412
That expression of the court on me
to just really give.

1406
01:41:25,446 --> 01:41:26,013
Me good

1407
01:42:18,098 --> 01:42:27,040
hope.

1408
01:42:27,040 --> 01:43:06,813
So it just goes is my guess to be

1409
01:43:55,762 --> 01:43:56,563
quite

1410
01:44:01,902 --> 01:44:05,005
if you tried this place was beautiful,
you know

1411
01:44:05,572 --> 01:44:15,782
you can do.

1412
01:44:16,416 --> 01:44:18,652
It seems very simple.

1413
01:44:18,652 --> 01:44:20,988
So here

1414
01:44:20,988 --> 01:44:24,992
am taking on this.

1415
01:44:24,992 --> 01:44:27,894
I do hope that good operations works.

1416
01:44:37,504 --> 01:44:39,773
By providing

1417
01:44:46,113 --> 01:44:47,147
a. Little bit out of.

1418
01:44:47,147 --> 01:44:47,948
The hand.

1419
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:50,517
Yeah, you did lose

1420
01:44:50,517 --> 01:44:53,053
my thought.

1421
01:44:53,453 --> 01:45:28,055
It was a way to get through.

1422
01:45:28,055 --> 01:45:30,290
Yeah. You know, this is.

1423
01:45:31,391 --> 01:45:32,025
This is us.

1424
01:45:32,025 --> 01:45:33,860
If we survive,
this will be another challenge

1425
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:37,097
and another until every last person
that I can't just get.

1426
01:45:37,097 --> 01:45:39,266
It's just crap.

1427
01:45:41,034 --> 01:45:41,868
That I do.

1428
01:45:41,868 --> 01:45:42,402
Follow me

1429
01:45:58,585 --> 01:45:59,853
like that didn't.

1430
01:45:59,853 --> 01:46:06,360
Get so crazy.

1431
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:07,394
He's going to pull this out.

1432
01:46:07,394 --> 01:46:08,261
I will trust.

1433
01:46:08,261 --> 01:46:09,696
They always

1434
01:46:14,368 --> 01:47:14,161
put me

1435
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:24,571
here. So

1436
01:47:25,839 --> 01:47:26,373
you're.

1437
01:47:29,042 --> 01:47:30,110
Coming. Me

1438
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:39,653
Woo woo

1439
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:45,992
woo woo woo!

1440
01:47:45,992 --> 01:47:48,028
You have

1441
01:47:49,062 --> 01:47:50,230
something urgent, come up.

1442
01:47:50,230 --> 01:47:55,535
And if we leave now, we'll be safe.

1443
01:47:55,535 --> 01:47:56,136
What is this?

1444
01:47:56,136 --> 01:47:56,837
This is an.

1445
01:47:56,837 --> 01:47:59,706
Ambush on the boat
you are going to use to escape.

1446
01:47:59,806 --> 01:48:01,842
Whenever we have like.

1447
01:48:02,342 --> 01:48:06,146
A fortune teller with this is I.

1448
01:48:06,146 --> 01:48:07,080
I don't know.

1449
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:10,350
It's the tablet of reawakening
is the reason why I left you.

1450
01:48:10,784 --> 01:48:12,285
My dad's been telling you the truth.

1451
01:48:12,285 --> 01:48:14,120
But it's Uncle Voyage.

1452
01:48:14,120 --> 01:48:17,257
He's been feeding your lies. If

1453
01:48:18,592 --> 01:48:20,260
that's don't rub it.

1454
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:23,296
With your go home.

1455
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:24,231
Bring that

1456
01:48:25,866 --> 01:48:31,705
with me, family.

1457
01:48:31,705 --> 01:48:34,040
You're not taking my money.

1458
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:36,576
You put down the tablet
and get off my ship.

1459
01:48:36,576 --> 01:48:37,878
All of you know

1460
01:48:39,546 --> 01:48:39,779
what?

1461
01:48:39,779 --> 01:48:40,580
You can do it.

1462
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:42,849
It's just my. But it's going down.

1463
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:46,253
Just to see that

1464
01:48:48,588 --> 01:48:49,256
he knows

1465
01:48:49,256 --> 01:48:53,426
I'm prepared to do terrible things
to get what I want to.

1466
01:48:53,426 --> 01:48:58,198
Even to those I can.

1467
01:48:58,198 --> 01:49:05,705
In the end,
that's all that separates the good.

1468
01:49:05,705 --> 01:49:11,645
But go

1469
01:49:14,447 --> 01:49:50,383
nobody hurts my man.

1470
01:49:50,650 --> 01:49:51,318
Who knows?

1471
01:49:51,318 --> 01:49:59,192
20,000 on the right hands.

1472
01:49:59,192 --> 01:50:02,429
I'm sorry.

1473
01:50:02,429 --> 01:50:06,199
This is nothing.

1474
01:50:06,199 --> 01:50:08,201
Apologies for icing.

1475
01:50:08,435 --> 01:50:11,805
So I.

1476
01:50:13,106 --> 01:50:16,676
So I left

1477
01:50:18,678 --> 01:50:19,145
and nothing.

1478
01:50:19,145 --> 01:50:21,615
When we get the right to.

1479
01:50:35,362 --> 01:50:38,832
Do this on this and I didn't work. Out

1480
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,235
right so people in low

1481
01:50:43,470 --> 01:50:55,949
ways not for

1482
01:50:58,151 --> 01:50:59,886
back in the past

1483
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:01,454
that's why.

1484
01:51:02,822 --> 01:51:03,023
Your.

1485
01:51:03,023 --> 01:51:05,859
Decisions each other for the spell

1486
01:51:05,859 --> 01:51:18,038
has to taking up opportunities.

1487
01:51:18,038 --> 01:51:20,740
Well you know

1488
01:51:29,249 --> 01:51:30,050
that's what we do.

1489
01:51:30,050 --> 01:51:31,885
We get to work it on it.

1490
01:51:31,885 --> 01:51:32,719
So I mean, what did you say?

1491
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:34,954
The range wasn't that poor stuff?

1492
01:51:34,954 --> 01:51:36,156
Cause, Mom, what

1493
01:51:37,424 --> 01:51:38,391
if that

1494
01:51:38,391 --> 01:51:46,433
person is.

1495
01:51:48,902 --> 01:51:49,536
Whatever that is?

1496
01:51:49,536 --> 01:51:52,439
Scoffs Now

1497
01:51:55,575 --> 01:51:58,812
it's out there

1498
01:51:58,878 --> 01:52:24,170
right now.

1499
01:52:24,170 --> 01:52:28,441
Feel has never been to
my father sifted through to chase down

1500
01:52:28,942 --> 01:52:36,382
people.

1501
01:52:36,382 --> 01:53:20,260
What is that?

1502
01:53:21,895 --> 01:53:22,495
All right.

1503
01:53:23,263 --> 01:53:26,132
This is an overture take of

1504
01:53:26,132 --> 01:53:28,134
whatever happens to us.

1505
01:53:28,201 --> 01:53:42,081
Dad is

1506
01:54:22,989 --> 01:54:23,890
honest

1507
01:55:53,479 --> 01:56:00,853
and I got this

1508
01:56:16,602 --> 01:57:07,253
for, you know, not.

1509
01:57:07,320 --> 01:57:07,620
This is.

1510
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:30,276
Going to.

1511
01:57:30,276 --> 01:57:33,446
It's another time. So.

1512
01:57:33,446 --> 01:57:35,782
You know. So.

1513
01:57:36,282 --> 01:57:42,522
So and so

1514
01:57:43,623 --> 01:57:44,190
and talk.

1515
01:57:44,190 --> 01:57:47,460
To our kids before

1516
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:50,029
the first to the point.

1517
01:57:51,230 --> 01:57:55,768
And just as I begin to pass
this piece of it's living through.

1518
01:57:56,302 --> 01:58:00,073
You down into those

1519
01:58:03,609 --> 01:58:05,244
as your time

1520
01:58:05,778 --> 01:58:07,113
has to shoot.

1521
01:58:08,915 --> 01:58:09,649
Your.

1522
01:58:12,085 --> 01:58:15,421
Stuff.

1523
01:58:15,421 --> 01:58:18,758
Sorry, your breath just smells like

1524
01:58:18,758 --> 01:58:19,559
old clothes.

1525
01:58:19,559 --> 01:58:25,565
It's bad.

1526
01:58:25,565 --> 01:58:28,101
What is this? Because the. Time stopped.

1527
01:58:29,001 --> 01:58:31,370
We got better with tracking security.
This.

1528
01:58:31,370 --> 01:58:34,340
That my makeup or doing

1529
01:58:34,407 --> 01:58:40,980
this.

1530
01:58:40,980 --> 01:58:41,948
I think you got to

1531
01:58:47,687 --> 01:58:57,363
do. I honestly
didn't think it was going to work.

1532
01:58:58,264 --> 01:59:06,172
It was assured us it would have gone.

1533
01:59:06,172 --> 01:59:07,306
Did we get our.

1534
01:59:07,306 --> 01:59:09,542
Oh, yeah,

1535
01:59:10,810 --> 01:59:12,211
Yeah, we got her.

1536
01:59:12,812 --> 01:59:15,281
Oh, that it's going to get spun.

1537
01:59:15,281 --> 01:59:15,815
Is it

1538
01:59:20,119 --> 01:59:23,356
time Saving Helper?

1539
01:59:23,356 --> 01:59:25,591
It's a red flag.

1540
01:59:25,591 --> 01:59:29,262
It's nothing I can do.

1541
01:59:29,262 --> 01:59:33,332
Pretty sure we're going to pass. Go

1542
01:59:34,901 --> 01:59:37,770
still go easy don't you.

1543
01:59:38,137 --> 01:59:40,540
No, no, no, no, no, no, no Final words.

1544
01:59:40,540 --> 01:59:43,910
No final. And proud of what I did here.

1545
01:59:43,910 --> 01:59:45,811
Nine heroes

1546
01:59:46,879 --> 01:59:50,416
to you.

1547
01:59:50,416 --> 01:59:52,218
You're doing that

1548
01:59:52,485 --> 01:59:53,986
real hard.

1549
01:59:54,620 --> 02:00:00,193
She must be something.

1550
02:00:00,193 --> 02:00:03,863
And you take good care of our girl

1551
02:00:09,702 --> 02:00:11,170
and, well

1552
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:16,242
void to

1553
02:00:16,709 --> 02:00:18,811
see Divine.

1554
02:00:18,811 --> 02:00:21,781
Close to being this

1555
02:00:21,781 --> 02:00:26,352
I cried sit.

1556
02:00:26,752 --> 02:00:28,454
And three.

1557
02:00:28,988 --> 02:00:29,922
To take.

1558
02:00:40,266 --> 02:00:43,402
No, no.

1559
02:00:45,171 --> 02:00:47,139
I need you.

1560
02:00:52,411 --> 02:01:54,607
To you know

1561
02:02:03,683 --> 02:02:04,550
look.

1562
02:02:21,734 --> 02:02:22,902
In. With

1563
02:02:50,296 --> 02:02:52,932
this of you happy about this?

1564
02:02:52,932 --> 02:02:54,900
Or if it comes after us.

1565
02:02:54,900 --> 02:02:55,534
Wait.

1566
02:02:56,635 --> 02:02:57,269
That's right.

1567
02:02:57,269 --> 02:02:59,171
You know, my kids do

1568
02:03:00,873 --> 02:03:01,240
some.

1569
02:03:01,240 --> 02:03:03,876
Okay.

1570
02:03:03,876 --> 02:03:06,579
What about you going back to the Harpers?

1571
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:08,814
Be with the people

1572
02:03:10,116 --> 02:03:13,586
and women in you.

1573
02:03:13,953 --> 02:03:16,355
So I know my last.

1574
02:03:17,390 --> 02:03:20,192
It was quite bad,

1575
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:22,161
but I wonder if you'd consider

1576
02:03:22,161 --> 02:03:25,097
having to go to

1577
02:03:26,298 --> 02:03:27,066
Paris.

1578
02:03:27,666 --> 02:03:37,743
Come right out.

1579
02:03:38,444 --> 02:04:02,768
I think this, of course, you never know

1580
02:04:03,569 --> 02:04:05,771
with subpoenas, Magic, expunge,

1581
02:04:05,771 --> 02:04:09,575
Lord never ever finally came to

1582
02:04:09,942 --> 02:04:10,509
his first.

1583
02:04:10,509 --> 02:04:12,411
Official act of

1584
02:04:12,745 --> 02:04:14,313
in the of Libya.

1585
02:04:14,313 --> 02:04:15,347
But it was

1586
02:04:16,682 --> 02:04:17,983
ever conclave.

1587
02:04:17,983 --> 02:04:25,624
He granted full protection
of the people and.

1588
02:04:28,194 --> 02:04:28,961
One could argue

1589
02:04:28,961 --> 02:04:33,332
that my actions reprehensible though
they were led to a virtual for the city.

1590
02:04:33,499 --> 02:04:38,070
And while I've only served the first year
of my sentence, I have to say it has been

1591
02:04:39,772 --> 02:04:44,343
I, I have taken a look inside.

1592
02:04:45,511 --> 02:04:47,613
I've asked myself

1593
02:04:48,180 --> 02:04:50,216
what's going on in that?

1594
02:04:50,783 --> 02:04:53,052
And, you know, I realized

1595
02:04:53,252 --> 02:04:57,223
a lot of it goes back to my book.

1596
02:04:57,223 --> 02:05:00,993
It was a stun pro to stop.

1597
02:05:00,993 --> 02:05:02,661
We've had a number.

1598
02:05:04,430 --> 02:05:05,464
Designed

1599
02:05:06,031 --> 02:05:07,066
session

1600
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:21,480
of, oh,

1601
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:39,164
4:00.

1602
02:05:39,164 --> 02:05:41,634
We a of

1603
02:05:43,002 --> 02:05:44,103
it is

1604
02:05:45,271 --> 02:05:48,941
was announced

1605
02:05:51,443 --> 02:05:54,413
with some

1606
02:05:58,450 --> 02:06:04,924
done.

1607
02:06:04,924 --> 02:06:06,425
Hello

1608
02:06:07,726 --> 02:06:10,195
And somebody please ask
me another question

1609
02:06:12,298 --> 02:06:12,965
anyone.
