1
00:01:03,324 --> 00:01:04,629
It'’s them!

2
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:08,155
Get ready.

3
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:11,071
Two more prisoners coming in!

4
00:01:12,202 --> 00:01:14,204
Prepare for docking!

5
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:16,859
In position!

6
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:20,210
Easy!

7
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:30,742
Gate secure!

8
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:51,154
Prisoner walking!

9
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:19,965
Oh, great. Another cellmate.

10
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,533
No offense, pal. You seem lovely.

11
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:26,668
Uh... Let'’s show you around. Get you situated here.

12
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:31,238
This is the bucket where our pee freezes. And, um...

13
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,978
Yeah, that'’s it.

14
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,850
What'’s your name, lass?

15
00:02:35,024 --> 00:02:37,679
Uh, That'’s Holga. I'’m Edgin. And you are?

16
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:42,640
I'’ve been in a lot of cells. Never shared one with a female.

17
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:44,120
Think I'’m gonna like it.

18
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:46,296
Word of advice,

19
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,820
Holga doesn'’t love to be disturbed while she'’s eating her potatoes.

20
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:51,519
Kind of the highlight of her day.Shut up, you!

21
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:53,651
Sure thing. Have at it.

22
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:56,350
Little shy, eh?

23
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:59,701
I'’m not so bad once you get to know me.

24
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,137
Mmm.

25
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,574
Don'’t be like that.

26
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:07,012
We could be very happy to--

27
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:16,370
I think I'’m gonna do this without fingers and make it a mitten.

28
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:18,807
Who am I trying to impress?

29
00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:23,028
♪ Not fortune found Nor fate divine♪

30
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,597
♪ Come close to toping The juice of the vine♪

31
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:28,947
♪ With cherry crew We sip and sway♪

32
00:03:29,121 --> 00:03:31,559
♪ Let'’s tip the tankard And waste the day♪

33
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,735
Oi! Stop that singing!

34
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:35,911
You got it, Tobias.

35
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:39,436
The Absolution Council is tomorrow.

36
00:03:40,307 --> 00:03:41,786
Don'’t get your hopes up, Ed.

37
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,614
What are you talking about?

38
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:46,661
Jarnathan is on the council this time. He'’s an Aarakocra.

39
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:48,750
If anyone'’s gonna free us, it'’s him.

40
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:50,404
Not gonna happen.

41
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:54,364
I tell you, Holga, this is your last day chopping ice.

42
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:00,762
By authority of the Lords'’ Alliance,

43
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:04,505
this Absolution Council will now come to order

44
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:09,684
in the case of Edgin Darvis and Holga Kilgore.

45
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:14,254
This is the second year of incarceration for the crimes

46
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:17,866
of grand larceny and skullduggery.

47
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,175
It is the task of this council to determine your eligibility for pardon.

48
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,047
What say you?

49
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:28,529
Thank you, Chancellor Anderton, esteemed members of the council.

50
00:04:30,095 --> 00:04:34,404
Before I begin, I notice that Chancellor Jarnathan is not present.

51
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:36,188
Should we perhaps wait?

52
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:39,627
Chancellor Jarnathan was delayed by the storm. You may begin.

53
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:41,368
I see. It'’s just that I--

54
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:44,849
we were really counting on him to attend.

55
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:47,199
Begin or waive your statement.

56
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:48,853
Very well.

57
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:53,510
I should start by giving you some context.

58
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:57,079
You may be surprised to learn I wasn'’t always a thief.

59
00:04:57,253 --> 00:05:01,126
Years ago, I became a member of the Harpers faction,

60
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,129
a network of spies who swear an oath to fight tyranny,

61
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,655
defend the oppressed and to ask nothing in return.

62
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:11,659
My wife, Zia, supported my decision, even though she knew the risks.

63
00:05:13,748 --> 00:05:16,533
By day, I'’d eavesdrop on mercenaries,

64
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,058
stop bandits in their tracks...

65
00:05:22,844 --> 00:05:25,803
and even bring Thayan Red Wizards to justice.

66
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:33,333
By night, I'’d come home to my loving wife, and daughter, Kira.

67
00:05:34,638 --> 00:05:36,988
To be honest, there were times when I began to question

68
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:40,601
the "asking nothing in return" part of my oath.

69
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,733
But my wife would always say,

70
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:45,649
"You don'’t have to give us everything, you only have to give us you."

71
00:05:45,823 --> 00:05:46,911
So what'’s the latest on Jarnathan?

72
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:49,000
Is he close by? Because I can wait.

73
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:51,263
Did you not hear what we said?Right, the storm.

74
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:53,614
It'’s just that based on what I know about Jarnathan,

75
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:55,790
I think he'’d be especially receptive to my story.

76
00:05:55,964 --> 00:05:57,966
And I'’d hate to have to wait a whole other year

77
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,229
to come back in here and--Proceed.

78
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:02,013
Absolutely. Here we go.

79
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:04,581
When you'’re a Harper, you'’re bound to make enemies.

80
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,064
And sometimes those enemies come looking for revenge.

81
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,900
No cleric can repair the damage from a Red Wizard'’s blade.

82
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:04,946
There was no way to revive her.

83
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:10,038
When Zia died, so did my devotion to my oath.

84
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,147
I'’m sorry, it'’s just hard to relive this...

85
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,194
-without Jarnathan here. -Again with this?

86
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:38,370
But he missed the most important part of my backstory!

87
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,677
How can he judge me without knowing my motivation?

88
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:44,376
We are entirely capable of deciding your case without Jarnathan.

89
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:47,205
-Get on with it! -Fine. Where was I? Uh...

90
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:50,731
By night, I'’d come home to my loving wife, and daughter Kira.

91
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:52,559
You went back too far. Stop stalling!

92
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:55,213
Right, sorry. Yeah, broad strokes.

93
00:07:55,387 --> 00:08:00,218
The next few months were among my most shameful.

94
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,309
That'’s when I met Holga.

95
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:06,224
She took pity on me.

96
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,967
Well, she took pity on the baby.

97
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:12,709
Holga was a fellow resident of rock bottom.

98
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:16,583
Many years before, she'’d been cast out of her tribe

99
00:08:16,757 --> 00:08:18,410
for falling in love with an outsider.

100
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:25,461
We quickly became like brother and sister.

101
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:29,073
With a relationship built on trust and mutual respect.

102
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:35,079
Neither of us had money or an honest way to earn it,

103
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:39,127
so we decided to table "honest" and we tried something new.

104
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:42,522
It'’s intoxicating when you realize

105
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:46,134
that what separates you from what you'’ve always wanted

106
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:49,224
can be as thin as a pane of glass.

107
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:06,284
You may be wondering how we could carry on this criminal lifestyle

108
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,721
with a young girl at home.

109
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:10,593
Well, we didn'’t leave her at home.

110
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:13,857
Hurry, hurry! Run, run, run!

111
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,599
Kira wasn'’t the only new recruit.

112
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:19,341
We also added Simon, a so-so sorcerer,

113
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:23,563
and a con man named Forge, who pushed us to aim even higher.

114
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:30,004
Before long, we became a team.

115
00:09:31,222 --> 00:09:32,659
Yes, we were thieves,

116
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,183
but I tried to hold us to a certain standard.

117
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:36,924
We never harmed anyone.

118
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:40,057
And we only robbed from those who would feel it the least.

119
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:45,802
But everything changed when we met the wizard Sofina.

120
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,631
We knew almost nothing about her.

121
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:51,895
Only that she wanted our help in robbing Korinn'’s Keep.

122
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:54,724
That'’s a Harper stronghold. I don'’t know if you'’ve heard of it.

123
00:09:54,898 --> 00:09:57,031
I'’m sure Jarnathan has.

124
00:09:57,205 --> 00:10:00,251
The keep was filled with the priceless relics seized from evildoers,

125
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:02,993
and only Harpers could gain access to the vault.

126
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:05,300
Which is why Sofina came to us.

127
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:08,651
At first, I refused. I wouldn'’t stoop that low.

128
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:11,611
But then Forge told me that among the relics in Korinn'’s Keep,

129
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:13,917
there was a Tablet of Reawakening,

130
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:17,312
capable of bringing back a single deceased person.

131
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:20,054
Even one killed by a Red Wizard'’s blade.

132
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:22,360
You can probably see where this is going.

133
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:25,886
Why can'’t I come?Sorry, Kir, this one'’s too dangerous.

134
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,844
Then you shouldn'’t go.

135
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:30,325
We have everything that we need.

136
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:33,415
Not yet. But this is the last one.

137
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:35,635
Trust me.

138
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:42,467
Chin up, Bug. We'’ll be right back.

139
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,252
I didn'’t tell her about the tablet.

140
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:46,036
It would break her heart if it all went to shit.

141
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,821
And, well,

142
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,953
to shit it went.

143
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:21,724
See you soon, love.

144
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,129
Intruders!

145
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:36,739
There they are!

146
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,964
We don'’t hurt anyone.

147
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:02,678
She'’s caught in the Time Stop! Counter it, Simon!

148
00:12:02,852 --> 00:12:04,680
I can'’t. Sofina'’s too powerful.

149
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:17,737
Take the tablet. Keep Kira safe.

150
00:12:22,306 --> 00:12:23,873
You have my word.

151
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:38,061
The truth is, even if this council were to sentence me to another two years,

152
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:40,716
or 20 for that matter,

153
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:45,721
it would never be punishment enough for the worst crime I ever committed...

154
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:49,899
robbing my daughter of her father.

155
00:12:50,073 --> 00:12:53,685
But know that, if you do choose to free me,

156
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,950
I'’ll spend the rest of my days trying to right that wrong.

157
00:12:58,299 --> 00:12:59,953
Anything you want to add?

158
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:01,432
I'’m good.

159
00:13:07,395 --> 00:13:08,788
Before you announce your decision,

160
00:13:08,962 --> 00:13:11,834
I implore you to please wait for--

161
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:15,664
Jarnathan!Pardon my belatedness.

162
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:18,362
I can'’t tell you how happy I am to see you!Step away!

163
00:13:18,536 --> 00:13:21,104
Holga, now!Guards!

164
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:23,106
Release me, sir!

165
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,282
She'’s throwing potatoes!

166
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:27,328
Oh, Jarnathan!

167
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,853
But we approved your pardon!

168
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:46,738
Fly, bird, fly!

169
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:11,807
He'’s still breathing.

170
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:16,464
I told you he'’d get us out!

171
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:24,053
Any sign of Kira?

172
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:27,491
Been empty for a while.

173
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:45,422
Where do you think Forge took her?

174
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:48,773
I can'’t see him leaving the Sword Coast. Forge always liked cities.

175
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:52,299
Some supper for you and your wife?

176
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:54,866
What? No. She'’s not my wife.Me with that?

177
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,869
With those lips?That'’s so gross. Just the drinks.

178
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,049
So, we take a boat down to Baldur'’s Gate

179
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:05,094
and then head north.

180
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:08,706
And while we'’re looking for Forge, I'’ll pay Marlamin a visit.

181
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,319
You sure you really want to put yourself through that?

182
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:15,887
What if he doesn'’t want to talk to you?It'’s not about what he wants.

183
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:17,802
Okay.It'’s about closure.

184
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,327
He sent you a letter saying he wasn'’t your husband anymore.

185
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:22,503
Wasn'’t that closure?

186
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:24,244
You wouldn'’t understand.I don'’t.

187
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:26,376
I clearly, clearly don'’t.

188
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:32,904
Is that...

189
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,820
Son of a bitch.

190
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,910
Forge is Lord of Neverwinter.

191
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:41,870
How did that clown pull that off?

192
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:44,133
Well, as long as he'’s got Kira, I don'’t care.

193
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:46,092
Come on. Let'’s go.

194
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:49,225
Thanks, pal. What'’s wrong with my lips?

195
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,532
They'’re too big for your face.What?

196
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:52,794
A lot of people like my lips.

197
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:25,348
I'’ve never seen this place so crowded.

198
00:17:25,522 --> 00:17:28,177
Must be coming in for the High Sun Games.

199
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:31,441
Yeah, my dad took me to the last one before they were outlawed.

200
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:33,095
Anyone win?

201
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:35,445
Well, one contestant made it to the final round

202
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:38,144
before a monster ate his upper body, so...

203
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:40,407
no.

204
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,717
It'’s nice to see that Forge hasn'’t lost his sense of modesty.

205
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:54,812
How long has it been?Two years.

206
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:56,945
No, how long have we been waiting here?

207
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:00,427
Dad.

208
00:18:01,384 --> 00:18:02,603
Holga?

209
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:04,213
Kira.

210
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,479
Oh!

211
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:12,308
-I missed you so much. -Hello, Bug.

212
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:16,747
-Come here. -Hi.

213
00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:18,314
Oh.

214
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:22,013
I thought about you every day.

215
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:27,845
I made you these.

216
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,460
-What are they? -Mittens!

217
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:36,550
Oh. Thanks.

218
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:38,900
Have you been okay?

219
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:42,295
Uncle Forge has been very good to me.

220
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:44,340
"Uncle" Forge?

221
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:48,910
Come on. He wants to see you.

222
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:53,262
I still wear the pendant you got me, Holga.

223
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:56,874
I use it to sneak around the castle sometimes.

224
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:01,531
So strange that you'’re here.Hey, Kir, look.

225
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:07,407
I want you to know I am so sorry for how things turned out.

226
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:09,626
I took a risk.

227
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,193
And it didn'’t pay off.

228
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,195
Why do you look mad at me?

229
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:17,330
Because you'’re acting like it wasn'’t your fault.

230
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:19,549
There they are!

231
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:22,596
Oh!

232
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,293
Old friends.

233
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:27,122
What a wonderful surprise. Come.

234
00:19:30,865 --> 00:19:31,996
Oh?

235
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,043
Do I spy a little bit of gray?

236
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,392
I do. I like it.

237
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:38,829
It'’s scoundrelly but professorial.

238
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:41,571
You look like a-- What do you look like?

239
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:44,748
You look like a well-read fisherman with secrets.

240
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:48,099
And Holga.

241
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:51,059
I know you don'’t like hugs.

242
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,887
But I need one. Yes?

243
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:56,020
-Oh. -Mmm. Mmm.

244
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,805
Mmm! Mmm.

245
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:00,373
These last years must have been dreadful,

246
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:03,027
but I tell you what, I did think you'’d serve longer.

247
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:07,858
Oh! Uh, we-- We got an... early release.

248
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:09,817
Good behavior.Yeah, behaving good.

249
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:11,819
Ah. I see.

250
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:14,213
Well, welcome. Welcome back.

251
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:17,520
Oh, that'’s blistering. That'’s blisteringly hot.

252
00:20:17,694 --> 00:20:19,087
Yet again.

253
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:21,568
Kira, we really should speak to the kitchen staff,

254
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:24,092
because there'’s simply no need for it to be this hot.

255
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:28,096
Yeah, yeah, the tea'’s hot. So, how are you the Lord of Neverwinter?

256
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:33,623
Right. Before you went off to prison, you charged me with Kira'’s well-being.

257
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:35,234
Didn'’t think much of it at the time.

258
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:38,280
But there came a moment when I looked into her eyes,

259
00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:40,935
and I suddenly knew I had to be a better man.

260
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:43,807
Obviously, I couldn'’t give back the treasures we'’d stolen,

261
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:45,766
so when Lord Neverember fell ill,

262
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,770
I seized the chance to try and, you know, make a difference.

263
00:20:49,944 --> 00:20:52,163
And the money from Korinn'’s Keep paved the way for my campaign.

264
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:54,165
But I will tell you this...

265
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,080
Couldn'’t have done it alone.

266
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,474
Ah! And here she is!

267
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:00,607
You remember Sofina.

268
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:03,349
You'’re still working with her?She'’s the one that got us caught.

269
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:06,787
Not true, no. Without her, we all would have been caught.

270
00:21:06,961 --> 00:21:08,832
And since then, she has become...

271
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:12,314
my top adviser. Mmm.

272
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,884
The tea is scorching, I do apologize. It'’s scorching hot.

273
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:19,234
Um, Sofina.

274
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,672
Would you mind very much, um...

275
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:24,587
Certainly.

276
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:29,897
Hmm.

277
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:32,291
Good. Thank you. I-- I'’m...

278
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:36,033
I didn'’t realize you were gonna put your finger in the cup, so...

279
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,949
I'’m gonna leave that for later.

280
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:42,518
Well, if you'’ll give us the tablet, Kira, Holga and I will be on our way.

281
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:45,782
Of course that'’s why you came back.

282
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:48,219
No, it wasn'’t for me. It was for that Tablet of Riches.

283
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:49,830
Riches?

284
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:53,268
No, it'’s-- it'’s the Tablet of Reawakening.

285
00:21:53,442 --> 00:21:54,487
I'’m sorry, what'’s this now?

286
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:57,141
The reason why I agreed to the heist.

287
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,014
Is that what he'’s told you? That I left you for more riches?

288
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:02,669
I told her the truth. She has a right to know it.

289
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:05,846
He'’s been lying to you, Kira.

290
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,979
I wanted to-- I wanted to bring your mother back.

291
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:11,895
Oh, Ed, come on. Look, I know how much you crave her forgiveness,

292
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:13,810
but I promise you, more lies is not the way.

293
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:15,638
You snake!

294
00:22:15,812 --> 00:22:18,075
You know damn well what he was after.

295
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:20,861
Why wouldn'’t you tell me if you were doing it for Mom?

296
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:23,820
Because I didn'’t want you to lose her again if I failed.

297
00:22:23,994 --> 00:22:26,606
But you can'’t blame the poor girl for distrusting you.

298
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:28,216
After all,

299
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:33,308
you have been lying since you set foot in the room, haven'’t you?

300
00:22:38,618 --> 00:22:41,142
-You escaped? -We were trying to get back to you, Bug.

301
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:42,622
Kira, look at me.

302
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:45,712
I swear to you, it was a Tablet of Reawakening.

303
00:22:45,886 --> 00:22:48,671
I was doing it for Mom, for all of us. You have to trust me.

304
00:22:48,845 --> 00:22:51,848
You told me to trust you when you left me.

305
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:56,940
Kira, no, wait, wait! Kira!

306
00:22:57,114 --> 00:22:58,551
Give her time, give her time.

307
00:22:58,725 --> 00:23:01,510
She'’s had years to resent you for your absence.

308
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:04,121
And you'’ve had years to poison her against me.

309
00:23:04,295 --> 00:23:05,601
No, that is not true.

310
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:08,212
We very rarely spoke of you at all.

311
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,302
Give him what he came for.The tablet?

312
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:13,740
I don'’t think I will be returning it.

313
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:16,960
Or your daughter, for that matter.

314
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:18,397
You bastard!

315
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:27,144
And now you'’re in the floor!

316
00:23:27,318 --> 00:23:29,495
Oh, I hate to see that.

317
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:33,281
Sofina really is a very, very powerful wizard!

318
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:37,241
You'’d have thought that you'’d have learned that the last time she trapped you.

319
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:40,549
You always wanted us to get caught.

320
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:44,771
No, I wanted you and Simon to get caught, but he managed to escape somehow.

321
00:23:44,945 --> 00:23:48,644
All these years together, and you double-cross us for this witch?

322
00:23:48,818 --> 00:23:51,038
Never put your trust in a con man.

323
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:52,213
Save for this...

324
00:23:52,387 --> 00:23:54,171
Kira really is happy

325
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:55,695
and very well taken care of here,

326
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:58,698
and I have truly come to love her as my own.

327
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:03,006
I never actually saw the appeal of being a father till I became one.

328
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,706
But to have another person look up to you

329
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,665
and allow you to shape them in your own image.

330
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,711
It'’s a bit like a god!

331
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:16,193
Well, hang on, I'’m a god and a lord. I am really doing all right!

332
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:17,673
Blackwood?

333
00:24:17,847 --> 00:24:20,197
Could you possibly return them to prison?

334
00:24:20,371 --> 00:24:22,069
And be sure to collect the bounty.

335
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:24,332
Well, I must away.

336
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:27,727
I am expecting two of the wealthiest men from Baldur'’s Gate and Waterdeep

337
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:30,991
to talk about the High Sun Games, which are back!

338
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:32,906
So there'’s something, isn'’t it?

339
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,430
It was genuinely lovely to see you both.

340
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,825
Ah! Ah!

341
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:40,609
Holga! Holga! Holga!

342
00:24:43,351 --> 00:24:45,092
Kill both of them.

343
00:24:51,402 --> 00:24:53,796
We got to get her out of there.We will.

344
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,320
But we need to think of our own hides right now.

345
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,280
-Yeah, you got this, right? -I know you don'’t.

346
00:24:59,454 --> 00:25:01,021
On your knees.

347
00:25:05,982 --> 00:25:07,201
Handsome blade.

348
00:25:08,202 --> 00:25:10,204
Is that the work of Ghelryn Foehammer?

349
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:11,945
How did you know?

350
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,773
The inlay on the haft.

351
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:16,645
Oh.

352
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:18,778
How'’s the weight? Does it parry?

353
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:21,128
It'’s darksteel.

354
00:25:21,302 --> 00:25:22,477
Mmm. Very nice.

355
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:24,000
Now put your heads down.

356
00:25:25,828 --> 00:25:27,090
Wait!

357
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:28,744
What do you clean it with?

358
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,965
You'’re about to lose your head.

359
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:33,836
This is what you'’re concerned with?

360
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:36,535
If you wouldn'’t mind.

361
00:25:38,493 --> 00:25:41,757
Boiled linseed oil. Once a month.

362
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:44,934
Should be once a week. That'’s why you'’re getting rust on the bit.

363
00:25:46,196 --> 00:25:48,764
Okay, chop it off.Chop it off, let'’s do it.

364
00:25:57,164 --> 00:25:58,165
Get her!

365
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:12,135
Stop her!

366
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:18,359
Oh, we got '’em now!

367
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:48,519
-Before we leave the city-- -Get boiled linseed oil, I know.

368
00:26:55,222 --> 00:26:56,615
Knock, knock.

369
00:26:57,964 --> 00:27:00,357
I wanted to make sure you were all right.

370
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:05,711
I knew I'’d see him again one day.

371
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,758
I just hoped it would be different.

372
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,500
Well, you have to understand that

373
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:15,416
when he lost your mother,

374
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:17,897
he sort of lost himself.

375
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:22,989
Why did he lie about the tablet?

376
00:27:24,555 --> 00:27:27,994
Maybe he was ashamed to admit how much he'’d given up for so little.

377
00:27:31,432 --> 00:27:33,086
I should probably go speak to him.

378
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:37,438
What?

379
00:27:37,612 --> 00:27:39,745
Well, he'’s gone, my dear. He'’s gone.

380
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,443
I gave him the Tablet of Riches and...

381
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:45,098
he left.

382
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:50,930
Holga, too?

383
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:54,194
I'’m sorry.

384
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,939
And I want you to know that even if he isn'’t there for you,

385
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:02,071
I always will be.

386
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,857
I know.

387
00:28:05,945 --> 00:28:08,208
The fact that you see good in me,

388
00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:11,124
makes me believe that there might just be some in there.

389
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,519
We could shoot an arrow with a message into her room.

390
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:19,480
What if it hits her?That'’s a risk we'’re gonna have to take.

391
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:23,005
Killing my daughter with an arrow? No, it'’s not.

392
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:26,226
Even if she got the message, she wouldn'’t come. She thinks of...

393
00:28:26,966 --> 00:28:28,794
Forge as her dad.

394
00:28:30,447 --> 00:28:33,059
We have to get into that castle and take her out ourselves.

395
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:35,539
That'’s crazy, Ed.

396
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,281
Castle Never'’s tighter than Korinn'’s Keep, and you know what happened with that.

397
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:40,457
We'’re gonna need a team.

398
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:42,372
Team? Who'’s gonna help us out?

399
00:28:42,546 --> 00:28:45,941
We have nothing to pay them with.Yeah, but Forge does.

400
00:28:46,115 --> 00:28:48,465
He said the richest people were coming to bet on the High Sun Games.

401
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:51,251
There'’ll be a fortune in that vault.Yeah.

402
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:53,383
Not to mention the tablet.

403
00:28:53,557 --> 00:28:54,820
And then Kira will know that--

404
00:28:54,994 --> 00:28:57,474
We abandoned her for the right reason.

405
00:28:58,693 --> 00:29:02,610
I wouldn'’t put it like that, but, uh, yeah. Yeah.

406
00:29:03,437 --> 00:29:05,004
Who do we get for this team?

407
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:07,310
You know, I wonder if Simon'’s still in Triboar.

408
00:29:07,484 --> 00:29:09,617
Simon'’s a terrible sorcerer.

409
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:12,446
We haven'’t seen him in two years. I'’m sure he'’s gotten better.

410
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:17,103
No one can hold a candle to this trick.

411
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:24,414
How about this one? You people like the smell of fresh-cut grass?

412
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,160
Smell that? It'’s fresh-cut grass.

413
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:33,728
My five-year-old can do that magic.

414
00:29:33,902 --> 00:29:35,774
But can he do this?

415
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:40,300
Boo.

416
00:29:40,474 --> 00:29:42,171
He hasn'’t gotten better.

417
00:29:42,345 --> 00:29:44,347
I don'’t think it'’s about what he'’s doing up there.

418
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:47,481
This is quite hard to be slightly blurry like this, you know.

419
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:50,092
Anyone can be very blurry, but to be slightly blurry,

420
00:29:50,266 --> 00:29:51,790
that'’s the real magic.

421
00:29:53,139 --> 00:29:54,140
Is that...

422
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,624
What? What was...

423
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,192
Hey!

424
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:05,238
He'’s nickin'’ our bits and bobs!

425
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:07,457
It'’s not what you think. It'’s all part of the act.

426
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:08,763
He'’s lying.

427
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:10,286
Get him!

428
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:16,640
Shield spell!

429
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,164
Shield spell!

430
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:28,348
That wasn'’t a shield spell.

431
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:45,931
I am not loving this show.

432
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:50,936
You'’re a dead man!

433
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,652
-Simon? -Holga!

434
00:31:11,826 --> 00:31:14,133
-Staying for an encore? -Get me out of here.

435
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,929
I could'’ve warned you Forge was a prick.

436
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:30,279
Soon as we left that vault, Sofina tried to kill me

437
00:31:30,453 --> 00:31:32,107
and he just stood by.

438
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:34,544
You know, there'’s rumors she made Lord Neverember fall ill

439
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:36,111
to clear the way for Forge.

440
00:31:36,285 --> 00:31:37,983
Her magic is on a whole other level.

441
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:40,637
Don'’t sell yourself short. We saw your show.

442
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:43,292
Yeah, you can hit her with that fresh-cut grass trick.

443
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:44,946
That'’s funny.

444
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,122
Look, I don'’t blame you for wanting to save Kira,

445
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:50,038
and I love the idea of knocking Forge off his perch,

446
00:31:50,212 --> 00:31:52,127
but robbing Castle Never isn'’t worth the risk.

447
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:53,955
And robbing your audience is?

448
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:58,264
How broke are you?Desperately.

449
00:31:58,438 --> 00:32:00,614
I was planning on sleeping in the theater tonight,

450
00:32:00,788 --> 00:32:03,051
but now that seems imprudent.So?

451
00:32:03,225 --> 00:32:06,141
Do we even know what sort of arcane magic is protecting the vault?

452
00:32:06,315 --> 00:32:07,708
We'’re gonna find out!How?

453
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:09,971
You gonna sneak past the entire Castle Watch?

454
00:32:10,145 --> 00:32:13,105
Me? No. A druid maybe, a Wild Shape.

455
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,846
They could get in and out undetected as a--

456
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:18,675
as a mouse or a...A deer.

457
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:21,809
Yes, a deer! It'’ll blend in with all the other deer in the castle.

458
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:23,028
Don'’t mock me.

459
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:25,291
Where can we find a druid?

460
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,642
I know a druid. Doric.

461
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:30,861
She'’s truly one of a kind.

462
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:33,299
Sounds romantic in nature.

463
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:35,431
Yeah. For me it was.

464
00:32:35,605 --> 00:32:39,696
She, however, found my lack of self-esteem unattractive.

465
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,394
Not your best trait.

466
00:32:41,568 --> 00:32:42,743
Thank you.

467
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:47,922
In the name of Forge Fitzwilliam,

468
00:32:48,096 --> 00:32:52,796
the prisoner is hereby sentenced to death by dismemberment,

469
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,887
for the crime of speaking ill of our leader.

470
00:32:57,062 --> 00:32:59,673
The Emerald Enclave will never relent!

471
00:32:59,847 --> 00:33:01,588
Justice cannot be killed!

472
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:03,372
On my command.

473
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:05,287
Your Doric'’s a bit of a radical.Ready?

474
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:06,593
Oh, no, that'’s not Doric.

475
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,726
Move in!

476
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,989
Kill her!

477
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:20,041
Move in!

478
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:22,696
Move in!

479
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,132
That'’s her.

480
00:33:37,972 --> 00:33:40,018
What is that again?It'’s an owlbear.

481
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:16,315
-How high is this place? -It'’s just up here.

482
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:19,013
Stay where you are!Wait! Wait! It'’s me!

483
00:34:19,709 --> 00:34:21,668
Simon.Simon who?

484
00:34:21,842 --> 00:34:22,886
Ouch.

485
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,368
Simon Aumar. Sorcerer.

486
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:28,414
I courted you.

487
00:34:29,197 --> 00:34:30,851
You said I made you feel sad.

488
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:33,897
Not from anything I did, just from who I was.

489
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,421
Oh.

490
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:38,250
-Yeah. -Yeah.

491
00:34:38,424 --> 00:34:39,903
What are you doing here?

492
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,297
We need a deer.We don'’t need a deer.

493
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:44,386
We'’re gonna take down Forge Fitzwilliam.

494
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:52,220
So, how'’d you come to live here?

495
00:34:52,394 --> 00:34:55,702
I was born to humans who decided they didn'’t want a tiefling child.

496
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:58,139
Uh-huh.The wood elves took me in.

497
00:34:58,313 --> 00:35:00,141
I joined the Emerald Enclave to protect them.

498
00:35:00,315 --> 00:35:01,882
That'’s all the more reason to join us.

499
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:04,493
You'’re the only one who can get into that castle unseen

500
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:06,191
and tell us what we'’re dealing with.

501
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:08,889
As you can imagine, I don'’t trust humans.

502
00:35:09,063 --> 00:35:11,457
I find you to be hateful and selfish.

503
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:14,503
Well, I'’m finding you to be a little mean.

504
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:16,505
If it helps, I'’m only half-human.

505
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:17,941
But you'’re a bad sorcerer.

506
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,292
No, Simon-- He'’s a mighty sorcerer!

507
00:35:20,466 --> 00:35:23,077
He'’s a descendant of Elminster Aumar.

508
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:27,212
The only way to succeed in this is to have confidence that it can be done.

509
00:35:27,386 --> 00:35:29,649
He doesn'’t.Yeah, I suppose that'’s fair.

510
00:35:29,823 --> 00:35:33,914
Look, Simon may not have my wit or Holga'’s strength,

511
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:36,177
but when it counts, this young man delivers.

512
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:39,180
It'’s why I chose him.He'’s also the only sorcerer you know.

513
00:35:39,354 --> 00:35:40,703
Holga, not helpful.

514
00:35:40,877 --> 00:35:43,402
What is it exactly that you bring to this?

515
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:48,015
Me? I'’m a planner. You know? I make plans.

516
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:51,236
You'’ve already made the plan, so what value do you have now?

517
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:56,937
If, uh, the plan fails-- the existing plan-- I make a new plan.

518
00:35:57,111 --> 00:35:58,460
So you make plans that fail.

519
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:00,070
No.He also plays the lute.

520
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:03,117
Holga, not relevant. Trust me, I'’m indispensable.

521
00:36:06,773 --> 00:36:08,557
Well,

522
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:11,908
none of the plans we'’ve tried to take down Forge have worked.

523
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,782
We dared to question how he came to power,

524
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:17,697
so he declared us enemies.

525
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:21,570
Began destroying our homes

526
00:36:21,744 --> 00:36:23,920
and executing our people.

527
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:27,533
If we don'’t stop Forge soon,

528
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,231
there'’ll be nothing left to defend.

529
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:35,149
I'’m not doing this for the money.

530
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:39,806
I'’m doing this for the people who took me in when no one else would.

531
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:42,678
So we'’ll keep your share then.

532
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:50,556
I sense your impatience.

533
00:36:52,384 --> 00:36:53,472
Szass Tam.

534
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:58,694
But you have always been the disciple I rely on most.

535
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,394
Doff your cowl.

536
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:04,526
You needn'’t hide your sigils from me.

537
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:09,139
I'’d rather be flensed and flayed

538
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:12,186
than spend another hour with Forge Fitzwilliam.

539
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,233
The man is insufferable.

540
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:21,369
But we never would have come this far without his "charm."

541
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:26,156
The living have befouled this world long enough.

542
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:31,684
Take solace in knowing that your work here is nearly complete.

543
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:35,557
There you are!

544
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,431
With your hood off, I notice.

545
00:37:40,606 --> 00:37:42,521
Probably best to keep that on.

546
00:37:42,695 --> 00:37:45,045
You know, you Red Wizards of Thay

547
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:48,353
are not as popular as you should be outside Thay.

548
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:52,270
And, of course, you'’re about to be considerably less popular.

549
00:37:53,793 --> 00:37:58,580
But far, far be it from me ever to tell you what to do.

550
00:37:58,754 --> 00:38:00,365
Caldwell and Piradost have arrived.

551
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:02,932
I was gonna give them--

552
00:38:03,106 --> 00:38:05,935
Awful, isn'’t it? I really have to do something about these chairs.

553
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:07,633
They'’re, uh...

554
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:12,594
Now, I think you will find that we have taken every imaginable measure

555
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:15,031
to protect the assets that you may-- or may not--

556
00:38:15,205 --> 00:38:17,730
choose to wager during the High Sun Games.

557
00:38:17,904 --> 00:38:21,124
We have new portcullises on every wing of the castle.

558
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,865
If the alarm is raised,

559
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,216
nobody gets in or out.

560
00:38:28,088 --> 00:38:30,743
And then there is...

561
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:32,875
the vault itself.

562
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:37,532
My chief adviser, Sofina, can give you all the details.

563
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,799
It is protected by the Arcane Seal of Mordenkainen.

564
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:51,546
Well, uh...

565
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,376
perhaps not all the details, but, uh,

566
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:58,379
suffice to say it is a seriously powerful spell.

567
00:38:58,553 --> 00:39:01,469
Might I inquire, what prompted you to resume the games?

568
00:39:01,643 --> 00:39:03,906
Lord Neverember considered them quite brutal.

569
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,126
Lord Neverember and I are very different men.

570
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,302
For example, I prefer to be up and about.

571
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:10,348
He prefers to be in a vegetative state.

572
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:13,438
You are terrible.

573
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:16,354
I can be naughty. No, I--

574
00:39:16,528 --> 00:39:19,705
The truth is that the games bring the city together like nothing else.

575
00:39:19,879 --> 00:39:25,624
And it is not the role of government to deny the people what they crave.

576
00:39:25,798 --> 00:39:29,889
Or to deny you rich bastards the right to profit off them.

577
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:34,154
Now who wants refreshments?

578
00:39:34,328 --> 00:39:35,634
Silence!

579
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:41,204
A Wild Shape is among us.

580
00:40:09,842 --> 00:40:11,104
Hey!

581
00:40:11,278 --> 00:40:12,540
Stop!

582
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:21,419
I can'’t grab her!

583
00:42:15,707 --> 00:42:18,057
So she did become a deer.

584
00:42:18,231 --> 00:42:19,885
Only at the very end.

585
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:22,714
Are you absolutely sure about Sofina?I saw her markings.

586
00:42:22,888 --> 00:42:24,846
No wonder I couldn'’t counter her Time Stop.

587
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,110
Forge knew all along. He'’s got my daughter in there with a Red Wizard.

588
00:42:28,284 --> 00:42:32,375
The vault is protected by something called "Morty Kamen'’s Arcane Seal."

589
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,768
Mordenkainen?

590
00:42:33,942 --> 00:42:36,162
Yeah, that'’s it.Oh, pity.

591
00:42:36,336 --> 00:42:38,338
What?If the vault has Mordenkainen'’s Seal,

592
00:42:38,512 --> 00:42:40,035
we'’re not getting in. It'’s impenetrable.

593
00:42:40,209 --> 00:42:41,733
Can'’t you just open it with magic?

594
00:42:41,907 --> 00:42:43,778
Okay, here we go.

595
00:42:43,952 --> 00:42:47,216
I hate how everyone thinks that you can solve any problem with magic.

596
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:50,350
There are limits. This isn'’t some bedtime story.

597
00:42:50,524 --> 00:42:53,309
This is the real world.So there'’s no way to open it?

598
00:42:53,483 --> 00:42:57,531
No, I mean, if I were one of the world'’s most powerful sorcerers, so, no.

599
00:42:57,705 --> 00:42:59,402
Or if we had the Helm of Disjunction.

600
00:42:59,968 --> 00:43:01,491
The what?

601
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:03,668
It'’s a helmet that disables all nearby enchantments.

602
00:43:03,842 --> 00:43:06,496
But it doesn'’t matter. The thing went missing ages ago. We'’re done.

603
00:43:06,671 --> 00:43:08,890
Huh? Come on.

604
00:43:09,064 --> 00:43:11,893
What'’s the problem? We can find that helmet.

605
00:43:12,067 --> 00:43:15,505
Even if we did, I couldn'’t use it without attuning to it, which I'’m terrible at.

606
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,551
You can do it. I know you can.

607
00:43:17,725 --> 00:43:20,075
You saying that doesn'’t make it so.Yeah, but you saying it does.

608
00:43:20,249 --> 00:43:21,468
But I can'’t.But you can.

609
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:22,730
But I won'’t.Just say it.

610
00:43:22,904 --> 00:43:23,992
No!Fine.

611
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:25,864
Can we just keep this between us?

612
00:43:26,038 --> 00:43:28,867
I don'’t want to hurt the group'’s morale.What morale?

613
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:32,479
Holga knows where the helmet is.You do?

614
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:35,656
My tribe fought the Cult of the Dragon over it at the Evermoors.

615
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:37,615
We could just ask them where it went.

616
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:39,965
That battle was a century ago. They'’re all dead.

617
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:42,097
So? Ask them with magic.

618
00:43:42,271 --> 00:43:44,752
He just made a whole speech how he can'’t fix everything with magic.

619
00:43:44,926 --> 00:43:46,406
Actually, that is something I can do.

620
00:43:47,668 --> 00:43:49,148
You can bring back the dead?

621
00:43:49,322 --> 00:43:51,280
I can'’t, uh, bring them back,

622
00:43:51,454 --> 00:43:54,153
but I have this token that lets me ask corpses some questions,

623
00:43:54,327 --> 00:43:55,807
and then they go back to being dead.

624
00:43:55,981 --> 00:43:58,070
Yuck.Yeah, it'’s fairly horrible.

625
00:43:58,244 --> 00:44:00,507
It'’s fairly wonderful.

626
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:04,076
We'’re off to the Evermoors. Thank you, Simon, for the drinks.

627
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,599
Oh, what? No--

628
00:44:05,773 --> 00:44:07,732
Just pay it with magic.

629
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:30,537
The Wild Shape must be in league with Forge'’s former partners.

630
00:44:30,711 --> 00:44:33,148
Perhaps Forge is working against us?

631
00:44:33,322 --> 00:44:35,324
As long as he profits,

632
00:44:35,498 --> 00:44:37,892
he will not interfere with Szass Tam'’s conquest.

633
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:39,894
I will find these thieves.

634
00:44:40,068 --> 00:44:41,853
Before you go,

635
00:44:42,027 --> 00:44:45,073
the men behind us allowed them to escape.

636
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,901
Understood.

637
00:44:48,424 --> 00:44:50,252
He'’s a Thayan!

638
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:15,713
Hey, Ed.

639
00:45:16,888 --> 00:45:18,585
Huh?Look where we are.

640
00:45:19,629 --> 00:45:21,109
Marlamin? Really?

641
00:45:21,283 --> 00:45:23,155
Why would you do that to yourself?

642
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:25,548
I'’m just gonna pick up some of my things.

643
00:45:30,858 --> 00:45:32,773
He painted the shutters.

644
00:45:33,382 --> 00:45:34,557
Pretty.

645
00:45:43,044 --> 00:45:44,045
Holga!

646
00:45:44,219 --> 00:45:45,873
Hello, Marlamin.

647
00:45:46,047 --> 00:45:48,267
-That'’s Marlamin? -Oh, yeah.

648
00:45:48,441 --> 00:45:51,531
We were all a little surprised the first time we met him.

649
00:45:52,488 --> 00:45:54,577
I thought your sentence was longer.

650
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,275
I busted out of there.

651
00:45:59,452 --> 00:46:01,236
Same old Holga.

652
00:46:03,412 --> 00:46:05,153
So what have you been up to?

653
00:46:05,327 --> 00:46:07,068
Oh.

654
00:46:07,242 --> 00:46:08,678
The usual.

655
00:46:08,853 --> 00:46:11,159
I'’ve got my garden. I'’m working on my book.

656
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:14,032
I see you still have that walking stick I gave you.

657
00:46:14,206 --> 00:46:16,643
Yeah. Yeah.

658
00:46:16,817 --> 00:46:18,906
Well, you can take it with you if you want.

659
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,952
Gwinn'’s not much for rambling.Gwinn?

660
00:46:21,126 --> 00:46:22,649
You home, darling?In here.

661
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:26,218
Oh! Squashed a pack of bullywugs down at the--

662
00:46:26,392 --> 00:46:27,785
Oh. Hello.

663
00:46:27,959 --> 00:46:30,309
Who'’s this, then?Oh, Gwinn, this is Holga.

664
00:46:30,918 --> 00:46:32,224
Oh.

665
00:46:32,398 --> 00:46:34,139
Heard a lot about you.

666
00:46:34,313 --> 00:46:36,097
I'’d shake your hand, but, uh...

667
00:46:36,271 --> 00:46:37,142
Pleasure.

668
00:46:37,316 --> 00:46:39,057
How long you in town for?

669
00:46:39,231 --> 00:46:40,667
Um, just passing through.

670
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:43,148
Gonna talk to some corpses south of Nesmé.

671
00:46:43,322 --> 00:46:44,802
Oh. Great, yeah.

672
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:49,067
Gonna get washed up for supper. What we having?

673
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:51,286
I cured a goose and I gathered some pickleberries.

674
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,635
Mmm.

675
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,681
Nice meeting you, Holga.Yeah.

676
00:46:58,772 --> 00:47:01,514
So how long have you two--Going on a year.

677
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:03,995
Does she make you happy?

678
00:47:04,169 --> 00:47:05,692
Happier than I did?

679
00:47:07,476 --> 00:47:09,914
Well, I'’ll put it this way: She makes her living honestly.

680
00:47:10,088 --> 00:47:12,568
She doesn'’t drink herself silly.

681
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,486
And she doesn'’t make me weep in the small hours,

682
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,358
wondering where she is.

683
00:47:19,532 --> 00:47:21,055
I was in pain.

684
00:47:21,229 --> 00:47:23,797
I was banished from my damn tribe to be with you.

685
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:26,974
And I tried to build us a home so you could forget that.

686
00:47:29,498 --> 00:47:30,717
But you never could.

687
00:47:34,068 --> 00:47:35,809
Gwinn seems lovely.

688
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,159
You deserve that.

689
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:39,552
Thank you.

690
00:47:40,814 --> 00:47:43,382
You know, when you left, I lost my family.

691
00:47:45,384 --> 00:47:48,039
I'’ve been fortunate enough to find another.

692
00:47:49,823 --> 00:47:52,652
And I wish nothing less than that for you.

693
00:47:56,221 --> 00:47:58,136
My sweet, old Ho-Ho.

694
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,240
We'’re gonna take down Forge.

695
00:48:15,414 --> 00:48:20,245
I'’m gonna show Marlamin and the Elk tribe they were fools to let me go.

So many of my kin gave their lives in battle here.

709
00:49:44,938 --> 00:49:48,681
I'’d always imagined I'’d be buried in sacred ground like this.

710
00:49:48,855 --> 00:49:49,899
Yeah.

711
00:49:50,596 --> 00:49:52,293
Anyone got a shovel?

712
00:49:58,604 --> 00:50:01,085
Okay, Simon, how does this work?

713
00:50:01,259 --> 00:50:04,001
I read the incantation on this cleric'’s token.

714
00:50:04,175 --> 00:50:05,480
Should be here somewhere.

715
00:50:05,654 --> 00:50:07,613
Here!

716
00:50:07,787 --> 00:50:11,182
All right. Once the dead man is revived, we can ask him five questions,

717
00:50:11,356 --> 00:50:14,315
at which point he will die again, never to be re-revived.

718
00:50:14,489 --> 00:50:16,274
Why five questions?

719
00:50:16,448 --> 00:50:17,971
I don'’t know, that'’s just how it works.Seems arbitrary.

720
00:50:18,145 --> 00:50:20,800
Can we get on with this, please?Right, yes.

721
00:50:29,243 --> 00:50:30,331
Delightful.

722
00:50:42,952 --> 00:50:44,345
Maybe I'’m not saying it right.

723
00:50:48,654 --> 00:50:50,264
I wasn'’t scared, merely startled.

724
00:50:51,135 --> 00:50:53,441
Here we go.

725
00:50:54,964 --> 00:50:56,923
Were you killed in the Battle of the Evermoors?

726
00:50:57,097 --> 00:50:58,968
Yes.Great!

727
00:50:59,143 --> 00:51:02,842
I mean, not for you. Sorry for your loss.

728
00:51:03,016 --> 00:51:04,800
Four more questions, right?

729
00:51:04,974 --> 00:51:06,106
Yes.

730
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,629
No. No, no, that wasn'’t for you.

731
00:51:07,803 --> 00:51:08,935
Did that count as a question?

732
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:11,111
-Yes. -Damn it.

733
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,680
Only answer when I talk to you, okay?

734
00:51:14,854 --> 00:51:17,509
Yes.Why did you say "okay?" at the end of that?

735
00:51:17,683 --> 00:51:19,076
I didn'’t.

736
00:51:20,294 --> 00:51:21,861
Fantastic. Where'’s the shovel?

737
00:51:29,738 --> 00:51:31,000
Toke Horgath.

738
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:35,831
During the battle, did you see the Helmet of Disjunction?

739
00:51:36,005 --> 00:51:40,140
It was in possession of my chief, Stanhard Grimwulf.

740
00:51:40,314 --> 00:51:42,011
Okay, good.

741
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:44,188
And what did Stanhard Grimwulf do with it?

742
00:51:46,146 --> 00:51:50,629
As the cultists breached the ridge, we knew we outnumbered them.

743
00:51:50,803 --> 00:51:55,416
But our advantage meant nothing against the dragon Rakor.

744
00:52:04,817 --> 00:52:06,123
Horgath!

745
00:52:06,732 --> 00:52:07,994
Horgath!

746
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,084
Take this and run.

747
00:52:11,258 --> 00:52:13,869
Keep it from Rakor at all costs!

748
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:15,654
Understood, sir. Don'’t worry.

749
00:52:15,828 --> 00:52:18,135
That'’s the last thing I remember.

750
00:52:22,617 --> 00:52:24,141
Oh. Yeah, well...

751
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,578
Thanks for your help.

752
00:52:26,752 --> 00:52:28,928
Let'’s go look for Stanhard Grimwulf'’s grave.

753
00:52:29,102 --> 00:52:30,712
Hang on! Hang on!Hmm?

754
00:52:30,886 --> 00:52:32,758
Aren'’t you going to ask him the last three questions?

755
00:52:32,932 --> 00:52:34,847
Ask him what? He already told us everything he knows.

756
00:52:35,021 --> 00:52:37,458
Well, you can'’t just leave him like that. Look at the poor bloke.

757
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,461
Oh, fine.

758
00:52:41,593 --> 00:52:42,811
What'’s your favorite food?

759
00:52:43,725 --> 00:52:45,640
Oats. No, barley!

760
00:52:45,814 --> 00:52:47,207
Oh, boy.

761
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:49,514
Do you like cats?

762
00:52:49,688 --> 00:52:50,950
Not really.

763
00:52:51,124 --> 00:52:52,169
Okay.

764
00:52:52,821 --> 00:52:53,909
What'’s two plus two?

765
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:55,389
I'’m bad at math.

766
00:52:56,216 --> 00:52:57,348
Don'’t you feel better?No.

767
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:01,482
Oftentimes,

768
00:53:01,656 --> 00:53:04,050
the most onerous decision a leader can take

769
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:05,965
is when to retreat.

770
00:53:06,922 --> 00:53:08,663
I issued the order.

771
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:13,625
I commanded my battle lord to deliver the helmet

772
00:53:13,799 --> 00:53:16,062
to our swiftest rider, Ven Salafin.

773
00:53:16,236 --> 00:53:18,369
If we can just make it over the ridge, we can--

774
00:53:19,674 --> 00:53:21,154
Not again.

775
00:53:22,764 --> 00:53:25,158
It was the morning of the battle.

776
00:53:26,899 --> 00:53:30,294
As I stepped out my bath, my foot slipped on the stone.

777
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:36,169
And then you went into the battle?

778
00:53:36,343 --> 00:53:39,738
No. I died. From the fall.

779
00:53:39,912 --> 00:53:42,784
But Stanhard Grimwulf said he gave the helmet to Ven Salafin.

780
00:53:42,958 --> 00:53:44,786
That'’s you, isn'’t it?

781
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,137
I'’m Sven Salafin. Ven'’s my brother.

782
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:50,575
This is a nightmare.

783
00:53:50,749 --> 00:53:52,011
Is Ven all right?

784
00:53:54,622 --> 00:53:57,059
I was wounded and had lost my horse

785
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,844
as I escaped the field of battle.

786
00:53:59,018 --> 00:54:01,412
I didn'’t care about myself.

787
00:54:01,586 --> 00:54:03,805
I just needed to keep the helmet safe.

788
00:54:13,641 --> 00:54:17,254
It was a Thayan, who bore the mark of Szass Tam.

789
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,389
I waited for the killing blow.

790
00:54:23,129 --> 00:54:24,478
But it never came.

791
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:27,481
He had a kind way.

792
00:54:27,655 --> 00:54:30,179
He told me his name was Xenk Yendar.

793
00:54:30,354 --> 00:54:33,487
He had fled Szass Tam and now lived in exile.

794
00:54:33,661 --> 00:54:37,448
As I died, he promised to keep the helmet safe.

795
00:54:37,622 --> 00:54:39,580
And for some reason, I believed him.

796
00:54:39,754 --> 00:54:41,974
You'’re joking. A "kind" Thayan?

797
00:54:42,148 --> 00:54:43,062
I speak truth.

798
00:54:43,236 --> 00:54:44,672
You speak horseshit.

799
00:54:44,846 --> 00:54:47,022
That Thayan lied and you died for nothing.

800
00:54:47,196 --> 00:54:49,982
The helmet'’s a dead end. We'’ll have to find another way into the vault.

801
00:54:50,156 --> 00:54:52,071
No, I'’ve heard of Xenk.

802
00:54:52,245 --> 00:54:54,465
He'’s a paladin. He helped the Enclave defeat the Clerics of Talos.

803
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:55,814
I know the name as well.

804
00:54:55,988 --> 00:54:57,468
My uncle said Xenk fended off a Beholder

805
00:54:57,642 --> 00:54:59,165
using only a sharpened gourd.

806
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:01,994
A sharpened gourd?Something sharp.

807
00:55:02,168 --> 00:55:05,345
The Thayans are murderers. End of story.

808
00:55:07,347 --> 00:55:08,348
What?

809
00:55:08,522 --> 00:55:10,437
I'’ve heard of him, too.No.

810
00:55:10,611 --> 00:55:13,310
He fought with my cousin in the Anauroch. He says he'’s a good man.

811
00:55:13,484 --> 00:55:17,226
Well, you can all go find this lovely Xenk and braid each other'’s hair.

812
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:18,750
I'’ll find another way.

813
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,929
What'’s his problem?He'’s got a history with the Thayans.

814
00:55:24,103 --> 00:55:28,325
I know how you'’re feeling. But we'’re running out of time.

815
00:55:30,936 --> 00:55:32,764
I'’d be betraying Zia.

816
00:55:32,938 --> 00:55:36,507
No, you wouldn'’t. You'’d be doing it to save her and Kira.

817
00:55:36,681 --> 00:55:39,161
Look, if Xenk turns out to be a prick,

818
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,207
I'’ll split him right down the middle.

819
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:44,645
That'’s very sweet.What have we got to lose?

820
00:55:48,606 --> 00:55:50,521
Anyone know where stupid Xenk is?

821
00:55:50,695 --> 00:55:53,480
Last I heard, he was working with the Harpers in Mornbryn'’s Shield.

822
00:55:53,654 --> 00:55:55,482
Great! Harpers.

823
00:55:55,656 --> 00:55:57,310
What'’s his problem with Harpers?

824
00:55:57,484 --> 00:55:59,007
He'’s got a history with them too.

825
00:55:59,181 --> 00:56:00,531
All right, let'’s go.

826
00:56:01,488 --> 00:56:02,663
Excuse me?

827
00:56:03,925 --> 00:56:05,405
I'’m still alive.

828
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:07,189
Right. Um...

829
00:56:08,495 --> 00:56:10,192
What'’s your favorite book?

830
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,194
Mmm, hard to pick just one.

831
00:56:13,326 --> 00:56:14,545
Fifth question, right?Yep.

832
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:16,677
Good.In terms of historical works,

833
00:56:16,851 --> 00:56:20,638
I'’d say The Fanged Tome of Lykanthus Szar.

834
00:56:22,074 --> 00:56:24,250
That was only the fourth question.

835
00:56:24,946 --> 00:56:26,078
Hello?

836
00:56:27,296 --> 00:56:28,689
Oh, shit.

837
00:56:31,779 --> 00:56:33,346
Heave! Heave!

838
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,130
Come on, we need more! Come on!

839
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:10,905
It'’s alive!

840
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,213
Thank you!

841
00:57:14,909 --> 00:57:16,258
Thank you, sir.

842
00:57:27,008 --> 00:57:29,402
He'’s interesting.I'’ve seen more interesting.

843
00:57:29,576 --> 00:57:31,448
Ed, go talk to him.You go talk to him.

844
00:57:31,622 --> 00:57:33,232
You know, I'’ve pulled cats out of fish.

845
00:57:42,067 --> 00:57:43,111
Xenk, is it?

846
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,419
That is a query I prefer not to answer

847
00:57:46,593 --> 00:57:48,247
without knowing to whom I am speaking.

848
00:57:48,421 --> 00:57:49,901
I'’m Holga Kilgore.

849
00:57:50,075 --> 00:57:53,165
This is Simon, Edgin and Doric back there.

850
00:57:54,427 --> 00:57:57,386
And what brings you to Mornbryn'’s Shield?You do.

851
00:57:57,561 --> 00:57:59,693
We'’re trying to find the Helmet of Dysfunction.

852
00:57:59,867 --> 00:58:01,478
Disjunction.

853
00:58:01,652 --> 00:58:03,480
Many lives were lost in defense of that helm.

854
00:58:03,654 --> 00:58:06,047
To speak of it would be to diminish their sacrifice.

855
00:58:10,008 --> 00:58:11,139
Janklee.

856
00:58:12,227 --> 00:58:14,752
Jankleeto you as well, good sir.

857
00:58:19,104 --> 00:58:21,846
You'’re known as a man of honor and integrity,

858
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:26,154
and I can assure you, our reasons for wanting the helmet are entirely noble.

859
00:58:26,328 --> 00:58:27,808
Yep. We'’re gonna rob someone.

860
00:58:27,982 --> 00:58:29,375
Holga!

861
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:32,117
Not just anyone. Forge Fitzwilliam.

862
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:34,380
And the Red Wizard of Thay he'’s partnered with.

863
00:58:36,338 --> 00:58:37,601
Come with me.

864
00:58:42,388 --> 00:58:43,781
What is this place?

865
00:58:43,955 --> 00:58:46,348
A Harper sanctuary.

866
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,655
But surely your friend Edgin already knew that.

867
00:58:50,222 --> 00:58:51,702
How'’d you know I was a Harper?

868
00:58:51,876 --> 00:58:54,226
You may have forsworn your oath,

869
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:57,577
but your oath hasn'’t forsworn you.

870
00:58:57,751 --> 00:59:01,755
Just because that sentence is symmetrical doesn'’t make it not nonsense.

871
00:59:01,929 --> 00:59:03,757
Why do you wish to rob Fitzwilliam?

872
00:59:03,931 --> 00:59:06,586
He stole Edgin'’s daughter and a great deal of treasure from us.

873
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,066
Also a Tablet of Reawakening.

874
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,894
He doesn'’t need to know all that.

875
00:59:10,068 --> 00:59:11,417
I was just...

876
00:59:11,591 --> 00:59:13,462
In other words, Forge is a real son of a bitch.

877
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:15,639
So you blame his mother for his corruption.

878
00:59:15,813 --> 00:59:17,075
What?

879
00:59:17,249 --> 00:59:18,772
No, it'’s an expression.

880
00:59:18,946 --> 00:59:20,557
I see.

881
00:59:20,731 --> 00:59:22,776
I do not traffic in colloquialisms.

882
00:59:23,734 --> 00:59:25,518
You'’re not a lot of fun, are you?

883
00:59:25,692 --> 00:59:27,912
If Fitzwilliam is truly allied with a Red Wizard,

884
00:59:28,086 --> 00:59:31,611
their intentions must go beyond the mere political.

885
00:59:31,785 --> 00:59:34,048
Over a century ago, the necromancer Szass Tam

886
00:59:34,222 --> 00:59:36,877
was one of eight zulkirs who ruled the nation of Thay.

887
00:59:37,051 --> 00:59:38,313
Great, a history lesson.

888
00:59:38,487 --> 00:59:40,577
But Tam'’s hunger for power was absolute.

889
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,015
On the eve of the solstice,

890
00:59:44,189 --> 00:59:47,192
residents of the capital gathered for a celebration.

891
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:56,114
Unbeknownst to them, or his fellow rulers,

892
00:59:56,288 --> 00:59:58,159
Tam had a plan of his own:

893
00:59:59,117 --> 01:00:01,510
to stage an unholy coup.

894
01:00:27,798 --> 01:00:30,191
He unleashed the Beckoning Death,

895
01:00:30,365 --> 01:00:33,891
a spell that would consume the souls of all who beheld it,

896
01:00:34,065 --> 01:00:36,763
enslaving them to his will.

897
01:00:36,937 --> 01:00:38,809
With the aid of his Red Wizards,

898
01:00:38,983 --> 01:00:41,986
Szass Tam created an army of the undead,

899
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,337
allowing him to conquer the entire nation.

900
01:00:48,732 --> 01:00:51,822
Szass'’s power extends no further than the borders of Thay.

901
01:00:51,996 --> 01:00:54,041
I suspect he and his Red Wizards will not be content

902
01:00:54,215 --> 01:00:57,218
until they have infected the whole of Faerûn with their maleficence.

903
01:00:57,392 --> 01:00:59,917
You done? Because we already know that Red Wizards are bad.

904
01:01:00,091 --> 01:01:01,658
And so does Forge.

905
01:01:01,832 --> 01:01:03,442
The question remains, if they helped him to take power,

906
01:01:03,616 --> 01:01:04,791
what do they stand to gain?

907
01:01:04,965 --> 01:01:06,880
Sounds like we have a common enemy.

908
01:01:07,054 --> 01:01:08,795
You give us that helmet, and we take Forge down.

909
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:11,015
No one stays Lord without a fortune to back him up.

910
01:01:11,189 --> 01:01:12,886
And the Red Wizards lose their puppet.

911
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:15,193
What will become of the wealth you burgle?

912
01:01:15,367 --> 01:01:17,151
What does that matter?

913
01:01:17,325 --> 01:01:19,806
I will not be complicit in the illicit use of ill-gotten booty.

914
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:24,158
Uh... Fine. We'’ll divide it amongst the townspeople.

915
01:01:24,332 --> 01:01:26,421
Swear to it.What?

916
01:01:26,595 --> 01:01:28,380
Place your hand on this Harper'’s Seal

917
01:01:28,554 --> 01:01:31,688
and swear that you will indeed distribute all the wealth you take

918
01:01:31,862 --> 01:01:33,777
amongst the people of Neverwinter.

919
01:01:33,951 --> 01:01:36,388
Sure, fine.

920
01:01:40,087 --> 01:01:41,610
Go on, Ed.

921
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:44,309
Promise you'’ll give Forge'’s money to the people.

922
01:01:49,967 --> 01:01:51,751
Promise I'’ll...

923
01:01:51,925 --> 01:01:54,449
give Forge'’s money to the people of Neverwinter.

924
01:01:54,623 --> 01:01:56,147
Keep this.

925
01:01:57,322 --> 01:02:00,804
You may not yet believe your words, but I do.

926
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,286
Yeah. Good for you. Simon, hold onto this.

927
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,940
Now, where'’s the helmet?

928
01:02:07,114 --> 01:02:09,638
In the bowels of the Underdark.The Underdark?

929
01:02:09,813 --> 01:02:11,728
Weren'’t you trying to keep it safe? Why would you put it down there?

930
01:02:11,902 --> 01:02:14,600
Because it is the last place that anyone who values their life would go.

931
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:16,254
Sounds lovely.Quite the opposite.

932
01:02:16,428 --> 01:02:18,952
I-I know. I was being ironic.

933
01:02:19,126 --> 01:02:22,826
I find irony is a blade that cuts he who wields it most especially.

934
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,872
Yeah? Is that what you find, Xenk?

935
01:02:26,046 --> 01:02:28,005
There is an entrance east of the Sword Mountains

936
01:02:28,179 --> 01:02:29,615
in the Kryptgarden Forest,

937
01:02:29,789 --> 01:02:32,792
from which we may descend to the ruins of Dolblunde.

938
01:02:34,359 --> 01:02:37,884
If I may be so bold, what caused you to renounce the Harpers?

939
01:02:40,713 --> 01:02:42,976
Being a Harper got my wife killed.

940
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:45,283
I'’m sorry.

941
01:02:45,457 --> 01:02:47,198
Did her assailants find justice?

942
01:02:47,372 --> 01:02:48,982
The Thayans, you mean?

943
01:02:50,418 --> 01:02:51,550
No.

944
01:02:51,724 --> 01:02:53,726
The Thayans are not all malevolent.

945
01:02:55,162 --> 01:02:57,730
I was a boy when Szass Tam seized control of Thay.

946
01:03:00,951 --> 01:03:02,996
I saw firsthand the horrors of the spell.

947
01:03:04,345 --> 01:03:07,087
Honorable men turned to monsters.

948
01:03:07,261 --> 01:03:10,221
Minds wiped clean in moments.

949
01:03:10,395 --> 01:03:13,964
Parents turning on their own child.

950
01:03:34,245 --> 01:03:36,813
I escaped, alive,

951
01:03:38,031 --> 01:03:40,207
but forever changed.

952
01:03:40,381 --> 01:03:43,994
You and I have both lost a part of ourselves.

953
01:03:44,168 --> 01:03:46,910
All that matters is what we do with what remains.

954
01:03:47,736 --> 01:03:49,434
I told you what I'’m gonna do.

955
01:03:49,608 --> 01:03:51,479
I'’m gonna break into Castle Never and get my family back.

956
01:03:52,263 --> 01:03:53,481
And the tablet?

957
01:03:53,655 --> 01:03:55,832
You plan to resurrect your wife.Yeah.

958
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,096
Very well.

959
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:02,012
I'’d only ask that you consider that this plane we call "life" is but one of many.

960
01:04:02,186 --> 01:04:03,404
Uh-huh.

961
01:04:03,578 --> 01:04:05,537
To drag your lady-love back to her old life

962
01:04:05,711 --> 01:04:07,321
is to deprive her of her new one.

963
01:04:07,495 --> 01:04:10,150
Can someone else ride next to this guy?

964
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,509
Follow me to the orifice.

965
01:04:24,817 --> 01:04:26,427
The orifice?

966
01:04:28,038 --> 01:04:30,562
The Underdark has many entrances.

967
01:04:33,304 --> 01:04:35,567
This is one of the less conspicuous.

968
01:04:43,357 --> 01:04:44,706
I'’ll go last.

969
01:04:46,534 --> 01:04:49,886
It'’s a day'’s trek. I'’ve chosen a path to avoid the populace.

970
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:52,453
Stay close and quiet.

971
01:04:52,627 --> 01:04:56,675
Whatever you'’ve heard of this place is merely a fraction of its true danger.

972
01:04:58,242 --> 01:05:00,244
Should the way become too dim,

973
01:05:00,418 --> 01:05:03,334
you may take my hand, and I will lead you.

974
01:05:06,337 --> 01:05:08,992
I'’ll tell you right now, I'’m not taking his hand.

975
01:05:20,438 --> 01:05:23,267
Keep your guard up. I don'’t trust this guy.

976
01:05:24,137 --> 01:05:26,270
Even though he'’s helping us?

977
01:05:26,444 --> 01:05:28,794
Ah, he'’s got something up his sleeve.

978
01:05:28,968 --> 01:05:31,188
The only thing up my sleeve is my arm.

979
01:05:31,362 --> 01:05:34,104
How could he hear that?I hear that as well.

980
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:35,932
I hate you.

981
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,296
The path to the ruins is just here.

982
01:06:00,695 --> 01:06:01,609
Keep still!

983
01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:06,614
Rochnon.

984
01:06:06,788 --> 01:06:09,617
Intellect devourers. Small but formidable.

985
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:13,534
They stun their targets and consume the brain, taking control of the body.

986
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:15,667
What do we do?Make no sound.

987
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:18,975
They'’re drawn to mental energy.

988
01:06:19,149 --> 01:06:23,457
The higher the intelligence of the prey, the more likely they are to strike.

989
01:06:40,561 --> 01:06:42,346
Well, that'’s a little hurtful.

990
01:06:43,651 --> 01:06:47,307
There it is. The Hanging City of Dolblunde.

991
01:06:48,526 --> 01:06:52,356
The helmet lies on the far side of this chasm.

992
01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:56,882
But be warned, the bridge is protected by an ancient Gnomish trap.

993
01:06:57,056 --> 01:07:00,277
There is a precise formula we must follow so as not to trigger the mechanism.

994
01:07:00,451 --> 01:07:03,280
What'’s the formula?It'’s quite simple.

995
01:07:03,454 --> 01:07:05,891
Starting from the center, use odd-numbered blocks only,

996
01:07:06,065 --> 01:07:08,328
moving forward with each step, except for every fifth step,

997
01:07:08,502 --> 01:07:09,634
which must be a lateral move.

998
01:07:09,808 --> 01:07:11,462
Left or right, it matters not,

999
01:07:11,636 --> 01:07:13,594
so long as the leader and the laggard remain equidistant.

1000
01:07:13,768 --> 01:07:16,771
After which, proceed. Again, odd-numbered blocks only.

1001
01:07:16,945 --> 01:07:20,036
However, at the midpoint we switch to even-numbered blocks.

1002
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:22,908
Same pattern, except now a lateral move after the fourth step,

1003
01:07:23,082 --> 01:07:25,258
until we reach the three--

1004
01:07:33,527 --> 01:07:35,181
I--

1005
01:07:35,355 --> 01:07:37,140
I may have...

1006
01:07:37,314 --> 01:07:39,446
put my foot on the bridge.

1007
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:41,927
Didn'’t realize that'’s where it technically started.

1008
01:07:44,669 --> 01:07:47,019
So... sorry.

1009
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:55,071
It'’s not very structurally sound.

1010
01:07:56,942 --> 01:07:59,858
Can'’t you just magic us across?

1011
01:08:00,032 --> 01:08:02,817
It'’s too far for telekinesis.

1012
01:08:02,991 --> 01:08:05,603
I'’ve got some rope in my bag.

1013
01:08:05,777 --> 01:08:07,344
I could tie it to the axe.

1014
01:08:07,518 --> 01:08:09,694
Toss it across so it sticks to the rock.

1015
01:08:09,868 --> 01:08:13,263
You know rocks are hard, right?Shut up.

1016
01:08:13,437 --> 01:08:14,742
Where did you get that?

1017
01:08:16,179 --> 01:08:17,571
What, Marlamin'’s walking stick?

1018
01:08:17,745 --> 01:08:19,965
I swiped it from a wizard over in the Greypeaks.

1019
01:08:20,139 --> 01:08:21,967
That'’s not a walking stick.

1020
01:08:23,621 --> 01:08:25,188
It'’s a Hither-Thither staff.

1021
01:08:25,362 --> 01:08:28,191
A what?Should have a range of around 500 yards.

1022
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:30,802
Watch.

1023
01:08:30,976 --> 01:08:32,108
Hither.

1024
01:08:33,283 --> 01:08:34,284
Thither.

1025
01:08:36,329 --> 01:08:38,853
It works!

1026
01:08:41,334 --> 01:08:42,553
See?

1027
01:08:43,554 --> 01:08:45,643
Didn'’t even need the bridge!

1028
01:08:46,557 --> 01:08:47,862
I did good.

1029
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,213
Good save.

1030
01:09:30,818 --> 01:09:35,693
This I give you now, trusting that you will protect it with your very life.

1031
01:09:36,389 --> 01:09:37,521
I will.

1032
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,350
Hold this.

1033
01:09:45,006 --> 01:09:46,878
There is evil here.

1034
01:09:58,977 --> 01:10:00,108
Are those...

1035
01:10:00,935 --> 01:10:02,241
Thayan assassins.

1036
01:10:02,415 --> 01:10:05,505
You look older, Yendar.

1037
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:08,813
Must be all that foul mortal blood.

1038
01:10:08,987 --> 01:10:13,948
And you, Dralas, look just as loathsome as the last time we met.

1039
01:10:14,122 --> 01:10:19,302
Then I'’ll see to it we don'’t meet again.

1040
01:10:19,476 --> 01:10:21,478
Leave them to me.

1041
01:11:54,222 --> 01:11:56,268
I'’m glad he'’s on our side.

1042
01:12:00,141 --> 01:12:01,055
We must flee.

1043
01:12:01,229 --> 01:12:02,927
Why? You killed them all.

1044
01:12:03,101 --> 01:12:05,712
'’Tis no simple feat to kill that which is already dead.

1045
01:12:10,717 --> 01:12:12,850
Ready for the next bout, Yendar?

1046
01:12:15,156 --> 01:12:16,810
Quickly!

1047
01:13:04,945 --> 01:13:06,817
That'’s one pudgy dragon.

1048
01:13:06,991 --> 01:13:10,168
It'’s Themberchaud. He must have found a new den.

1049
01:13:10,342 --> 01:13:11,822
Did he eat the last one?

1050
01:14:29,116 --> 01:14:30,204
I got you!

1051
01:14:41,346 --> 01:14:43,174
It'’s a dead end!

1052
01:14:43,957 --> 01:14:45,829
Simon! Up there!

1053
01:15:38,011 --> 01:15:39,230
Thanks for that.

1054
01:15:40,187 --> 01:15:41,972
You'’d have done the same for me.

1055
01:15:43,713 --> 01:15:44,714
Yeah.

1056
01:15:47,281 --> 01:15:48,848
Bastard won'’t quit!

1057
01:15:59,598 --> 01:16:01,644
Come on! He'’s stuck!

1058
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:03,994
So are we.

1059
01:16:10,435 --> 01:16:12,263
We'’re gonna drown!

1060
01:16:12,437 --> 01:16:15,527
Well, portal us out of here!I can only portal us to what I can see!

1061
01:16:15,701 --> 01:16:17,355
You want to go from that wall to that wall?

1062
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,663
It'’s salt water.

1063
01:16:20,837 --> 01:16:23,579
Simon, you remember that trick you did in Triboar?

1064
01:16:23,753 --> 01:16:24,710
Fresh-cut grass smell?

1065
01:16:24,884 --> 01:16:27,191
No, the flame finger one.

1066
01:16:27,365 --> 01:16:29,106
Yeah, why?Holga, hit him!

1067
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,108
You want to make him angrier?

1068
01:16:31,282 --> 01:16:33,676
When I say so, everybody goes underwater.

1069
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:36,287
And that'’ll be your cue, Simon, all right?

1070
01:16:36,461 --> 01:16:38,071
What are you looking at?

1071
01:16:38,245 --> 01:16:41,074
A Harper shaking off his slumber.

1072
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:43,599
Go, Holga!

1073
01:16:48,342 --> 01:16:49,517
Again!

1074
01:16:52,738 --> 01:16:53,565
Now!

1075
01:17:32,517 --> 01:17:33,953
This is where I leave you.

1076
01:17:34,127 --> 01:17:36,303
I wish you every success on your journey.

1077
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:40,438
You'’re not coming?Would that I could.

1078
01:17:40,612 --> 01:17:43,049
But this is your quest.

1079
01:17:43,223 --> 01:17:46,574
I have given you the tools. You must utilize them.

1080
01:17:46,749 --> 01:17:48,402
Can'’t you utilize them for us?

1081
01:17:48,576 --> 01:17:51,101
Because you'’re much better at fighting and strategy and...

1082
01:17:51,275 --> 01:17:53,669
Pretty much everything but talking.

1083
01:17:55,366 --> 01:17:56,497
Talking to you isn'’t great.

1084
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:57,760
Mmm.

1085
01:17:59,457 --> 01:18:02,765
In those instances where faith wanes and doubt waxes,

1086
01:18:02,939 --> 01:18:04,418
I recall the Tenets of the Ancients...

1087
01:18:04,592 --> 01:18:06,333
Okay. See you later.

1088
01:18:21,914 --> 01:18:23,263
There he goes.

1089
01:18:25,483 --> 01:18:27,093
Just wandering off.

1090
01:18:28,616 --> 01:18:30,967
Walks in such a straight line.

1091
01:18:32,142 --> 01:18:34,057
Uh-oh. Wait a minute. He'’s coming up on a rock.

1092
01:18:34,231 --> 01:18:36,407
Is he gonna go around?

1093
01:18:36,581 --> 01:18:37,843
Nope.

1094
01:18:38,017 --> 01:18:39,845
Right over the rock.

1095
01:18:47,113 --> 01:18:48,854
What are you mumbling?

1096
01:18:49,028 --> 01:18:51,161
I'’m preparing to attune.

1097
01:18:51,335 --> 01:18:53,990
If I can'’t connect with it, it'’ll be useless.

1098
01:18:55,469 --> 01:18:58,211
That'’s a lot of pressure, given all we went through to get it.

1099
01:18:58,385 --> 01:18:59,952
Yeah, I realize that.

1100
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:04,348
So our entire fate rests on you.

1101
01:19:05,044 --> 01:19:07,133
Come on.

1102
01:19:30,113 --> 01:19:33,507
There he is, the great Simon Aumar.

1103
01:19:33,681 --> 01:19:36,597
Sorcerer descended from wizarding blood.

1104
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:38,034
Who are you?

1105
01:19:38,686 --> 01:19:40,166
Don'’t you know me?

1106
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:43,909
My name is Aumar too.

1107
01:19:45,606 --> 01:19:46,999
You'’re my great-great grandfather.

1108
01:19:50,568 --> 01:19:52,657
That'’s quite a helm.

1109
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:55,616
What makes you think you'’re worthy of it?

1110
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,445
I believe in myself?

1111
01:19:58,619 --> 01:20:00,056
You'’re asking me?

1112
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:02,319
No, I'’m-- I'’m sure.

1113
01:20:02,493 --> 01:20:04,103
I'’m a great sorcerer.

1114
01:20:04,277 --> 01:20:05,626
Are you now?

1115
01:20:06,627 --> 01:20:08,673
Funny thing about magic.

1116
01:20:09,717 --> 01:20:12,068
It chooses who may wield it.

1117
01:20:12,242 --> 01:20:14,548
And it does not suffer fools.

1118
01:20:14,722 --> 01:20:16,072
Why are you telling me this?

1119
01:20:16,246 --> 01:20:19,336
I think you know, Simon.

1120
01:20:24,036 --> 01:20:25,516
Did you attune with it?

1121
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:26,996
You okay?

1122
01:20:27,474 --> 01:20:28,649
I got you.

1123
01:20:29,912 --> 01:20:31,478
What happened?

1124
01:20:31,652 --> 01:20:32,871
I, uh...

1125
01:20:33,045 --> 01:20:35,134
-I spoke to someone. -Yeah?

1126
01:20:35,308 --> 01:20:37,180
My great-great grandfather. He was...

1127
01:20:38,224 --> 01:20:38,964
unhelpful.

1128
01:20:39,138 --> 01:20:41,097
You spoke to him?

1129
01:20:41,271 --> 01:20:43,839
From here, it looked like the helmet flew off the second you put it on.

1130
01:20:44,013 --> 01:20:45,841
Well, time moves differently there.

1131
01:20:46,015 --> 01:20:47,843
Okay, I'’ll try a different approach.

1132
01:20:48,017 --> 01:20:50,019
Great. New approach. Try it.

1133
01:20:51,629 --> 01:20:52,760
You got this. You got this.

1134
01:20:59,289 --> 01:21:01,465
You'’re getting better. You didn'’t fly as far.

1135
01:21:01,639 --> 01:21:03,032
Stick with it.

1136
01:21:03,206 --> 01:21:04,772
We have six hours till we leave for Neverwinter.

1137
01:21:04,947 --> 01:21:06,818
You fail, I never get my family back.

1138
01:21:06,992 --> 01:21:08,080
Brilliant.

1139
01:21:27,273 --> 01:21:29,449
I'’ve never seen a bigger coward.

1140
01:21:29,623 --> 01:21:32,061
Coward? You'’re under here, too.

1141
01:21:32,713 --> 01:21:33,932
Fine. I'’ll handle it.

1142
01:21:34,106 --> 01:21:35,891
No, no, no.

1143
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:38,545
I'’ve got this.

1144
01:21:40,852 --> 01:21:43,159
And you want to be a Harper.

1145
01:21:43,333 --> 01:21:44,595
Quiet!

1146
01:21:48,991 --> 01:21:51,167
Oh, God. Damn.

1147
01:21:51,776 --> 01:21:53,082
There it is.

1148
01:21:54,605 --> 01:21:56,694
Stop trying to capture it.

1149
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,613
You just have to let it go.

1150
01:22:04,049 --> 01:22:05,137
Ed!

1151
01:22:06,138 --> 01:22:08,575
Ed! We'’ve got a problem.

1152
01:22:08,749 --> 01:22:10,142
I can'’t do it.

1153
01:22:11,187 --> 01:22:12,971
-The helmet? -I'’ve been at it for hours!

1154
01:22:13,145 --> 01:22:14,930
I can'’t get past the old bastard!

1155
01:22:15,104 --> 01:22:17,410
I said I couldn'’t attune. Now I'’m the prat!

1156
01:22:17,584 --> 01:22:19,108
What'’s the racket?

1157
01:22:19,282 --> 01:22:21,458
He'’s having a little trouble with the helm.

1158
01:22:21,632 --> 01:22:23,721
Come on, Simon, just do it.

1159
01:22:23,895 --> 01:22:27,116
Oh. yeah, okay. Yeah. Thanks, Holga. I'’ll just do it.

1160
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:30,075
This is exactly what I told you would happen back at the tavern,

1161
01:22:30,249 --> 01:22:33,078
but you wouldn'’t listen.What do you mean, you told him?

1162
01:22:33,252 --> 01:22:35,167
He said to keep it between us for morale.

1163
01:22:35,341 --> 01:22:36,952
I--Do you know why?

1164
01:22:37,126 --> 01:22:39,955
Because he is the most pigheaded person I'’ve ever known!

1165
01:22:40,129 --> 01:22:42,261
You talk us into doing things you know won'’t work,

1166
01:22:42,435 --> 01:22:44,481
and then you blame us when it goes pear-shaped!

1167
01:22:44,655 --> 01:22:46,918
If you can'’t attune, we'’ll figure out a Plan B.

1168
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:48,659
Plan B? We dug up my family.

1169
01:22:48,833 --> 01:22:50,617
We went to the Underdark for that helmet.

1170
01:22:50,791 --> 01:22:53,142
And you knew the whole time that he couldn'’t use it?

1171
01:22:53,316 --> 01:22:55,100
You humans. You just can'’t help but lie.

1172
01:22:55,274 --> 01:22:57,973
I didn'’t lie. I really thought Simon could do it.

1173
01:22:58,147 --> 01:23:01,063
Guys, look. We got a couple hours till the games begin.

1174
01:23:01,237 --> 01:23:03,413
This is what we do. We pivot.

1175
01:23:03,587 --> 01:23:06,111
Instead of dwelling on what went wrong and who lied to whom,

1176
01:23:06,285 --> 01:23:08,157
let'’s put our heads together and figure out a plan!

1177
01:23:08,331 --> 01:23:10,246
I'’m gonna figure out my way home.

1178
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:12,509
I can'’t believe I put my faith in any of you.

1179
01:23:12,683 --> 01:23:15,468
Yeah, I'’m going too. Sorry about Kira.

1180
01:23:17,905 --> 01:23:20,473
We'’ll find another way to get her. Just not today.

1181
01:23:20,647 --> 01:23:23,694
It has to be today. We'’re not done until my daughter'’s safe.

1182
01:23:23,868 --> 01:23:25,043
Aren'’t you sick of failing?

1183
01:23:25,217 --> 01:23:27,176
No! That'’s the whole point!

1184
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:31,571
We must never stop failing, because the minute we do, we'’ve failed.

1185
01:23:32,398 --> 01:23:34,313
Huh?Look,

1186
01:23:34,487 --> 01:23:38,535
none of us here can say our lives have gone the way we had hoped for.

1187
01:23:39,101 --> 01:23:40,145
Right?

1188
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:41,712
Holga.

1189
01:23:41,886 --> 01:23:43,844
You left your tribe to be with a man

1190
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:47,587
who left you because you were so upset about leaving your tribe.

1191
01:23:47,761 --> 01:23:50,068
And if you quit now, that'’s in stone!

1192
01:23:50,242 --> 01:23:52,114
Same with you, Simon.

1193
01:23:52,288 --> 01:23:55,291
You'’re a petty thief masquerading as a pettier sorcerer.

1194
01:23:55,465 --> 01:23:58,033
You gonna go back to your show?It'’s better than dying.

1195
01:23:58,207 --> 01:23:59,817
There'’s worse things than dying.

1196
01:23:59,991 --> 01:24:01,906
And, Doric, you have integrity,

1197
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:05,040
and I am sure the last thing you want to do is tell the Emerald Enclave

1198
01:24:05,214 --> 01:24:07,564
that you had a chance to save them but you walked away.

1199
01:24:07,738 --> 01:24:10,436
Hey, You'’re quick to call us failures. What about you, Ed?

1200
01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:14,136
Me? I'’m the champion of failures!

1201
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:17,400
I lost everything that ever mattered to me and it was all my fault.

1202
01:24:23,406 --> 01:24:25,625
You want to know who really killed my wife?

1203
01:24:28,498 --> 01:24:29,629
I did.

1204
01:24:31,283 --> 01:24:34,547
I decided we deserved a better life than a Harper'’s oath would allow us.

1205
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:39,857
But I didn'’t know that Red Wizards marked their treasure.

1206
01:24:42,555 --> 01:24:44,383
I led them right to our door.

1207
01:24:46,994 --> 01:24:50,128
I didn'’t even have the good luck to be home when they got there.

1208
01:24:51,738 --> 01:24:54,741
I failed the Harpers, I failed my family, I failed all of you.

1209
01:24:54,915 --> 01:24:56,787
Which is exactly why I can'’t quit.

1210
01:24:56,961 --> 01:24:59,659
So if you'’ll excuse me, I'’m gonna go sit on this rock

1211
01:25:00,617 --> 01:25:02,097
and make a plan.

1212
01:25:14,848 --> 01:25:16,154
Move over.

1213
01:25:51,581 --> 01:25:54,366
I'’d sit too, but there'’s no more room on the rock.

1214
01:25:56,847 --> 01:25:58,109
How about this?

1215
01:25:59,415 --> 01:26:01,721
We use the Hither-Thither Staff to get into the vault.

1216
01:26:01,895 --> 01:26:03,462
No, I'’ve explained this.

1217
01:26:03,636 --> 01:26:05,334
You can'’t Hither-Thither into a room you can'’t see.

1218
01:26:05,508 --> 01:26:06,944
I'’m not saying that.

1219
01:26:07,118 --> 01:26:09,425
I'’m saying we put the portal on something

1220
01:26:09,599 --> 01:26:11,775
and then sneak that thing into the vault.

1221
01:26:11,949 --> 01:26:15,082
Mmm. The only thing going in that vault is treasure.

1222
01:26:15,257 --> 01:26:17,650
So we put the portal on some treasure.

1223
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,829
Forge did say the richest men in Baldur'’s Gate and Waterdeep

1224
01:26:23,003 --> 01:26:24,788
are bringing loot to the city.

1225
01:26:25,789 --> 01:26:27,704
They'’ll be traveling the High Road.

1226
01:26:27,878 --> 01:26:30,141
We could catch one of their convoys!There'’ll be dozens of guards.

1227
01:26:30,315 --> 01:26:31,969
Yeah, but the guards will be guarding against people

1228
01:26:32,143 --> 01:26:34,972
taking things out of their wagon, not putting them in!

1229
01:26:35,146 --> 01:26:37,409
Holga, I could kiss you!Try it.

1230
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:43,937
Perfect. Thank you so much.

1231
01:28:00,231 --> 01:28:01,450
Oh!

1232
01:28:28,041 --> 01:28:29,086
Oh!

1233
01:29:06,384 --> 01:29:11,215
What a profound joy it is to welcome you,

1234
01:29:11,389 --> 01:29:15,175
the good people of Neverwinter, to the resumption

1235
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:18,004
of the High Sun Games!

1236
01:29:21,878 --> 01:29:25,185
I guarantee that you are in for the most riveting spectacle

1237
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,362
on all the Sword Coast.

1238
01:29:27,536 --> 01:29:29,799
The rules are very simple:

1239
01:29:29,973 --> 01:29:33,977
Five harrowing challenges. Five teams of champions.

1240
01:29:34,151 --> 01:29:37,372
Whoever survives to reach the Cage of Sanctuary

1241
01:29:37,546 --> 01:29:40,462
moves on to the next stage.

1242
01:29:41,288 --> 01:29:43,465
One thing: I do urge you,

1243
01:29:43,639 --> 01:29:47,643
please do not leave the arena till the close of the games,

1244
01:29:47,817 --> 01:29:50,080
as there will be a wonderful gift

1245
01:29:50,254 --> 01:29:53,257
for each and every one of you!

1246
01:29:58,871 --> 01:30:00,351
All right, take me down.

1247
01:30:00,525 --> 01:30:02,614
This is absurdly high. It'’s not what we discussed.

1248
01:30:04,964 --> 01:30:07,227
Come on. Gotta get it all done.

1249
01:30:16,715 --> 01:30:18,674
Oh, no.What happened?

1250
01:30:18,848 --> 01:30:21,503
It'’s facing the floor. Why would they store it that way?

1251
01:30:28,161 --> 01:30:29,815
Damn it.Why does nothing go our way?

1252
01:30:29,989 --> 01:30:31,774
Let me try. Maybe I can make a gap.

1253
01:30:33,384 --> 01:30:34,907
The games have started.

1254
01:30:36,213 --> 01:30:39,085
We'’re going to Plan C.Oh, bollocks. What'’s Plan C?

1255
01:30:39,259 --> 01:30:41,653
Plan C is we go back to Plan A.

1256
01:30:41,827 --> 01:30:43,046
You'’re gonna attune to the helmet.

1257
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:45,265
Why don'’t you just call it Plan A?

1258
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,138
Plan A has a stink on it.You know damn well I can'’t attune to the thing.

1259
01:30:48,312 --> 01:30:50,619
That'’s not true! You couldn'’t attune to it.

1260
01:30:50,793 --> 01:30:53,012
Look at me. Look at me! Huh?

1261
01:30:53,186 --> 01:30:54,884
Do you remember that job in Loudwater?

1262
01:30:55,058 --> 01:30:58,017
You couldn'’t spider climb until Jolym sicced his dog on you.

1263
01:30:58,191 --> 01:31:00,150
And when we robbed the spear of Aoth Fezim,

1264
01:31:00,324 --> 01:31:03,240
your stoneskin spell failed until the arrows were inches away.

1265
01:31:03,414 --> 01:31:07,026
Even in Triboar, you flipped the gravity of a whole theater!

1266
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:08,245
You did?

1267
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:11,074
By accident. It was wild magic,

1268
01:31:11,248 --> 01:31:14,294
and that only happened because they were gonna kill me.Exactly!

1269
01:31:15,252 --> 01:31:17,515
Look, you are at your strongest

1270
01:31:17,689 --> 01:31:19,822
when you think you'’re at your weakest.

1271
01:31:19,996 --> 01:31:21,693
But you deliver.

1272
01:31:23,434 --> 01:31:26,132
You'’re gonna get into that vault, okay?

1273
01:31:26,306 --> 01:31:27,830
Not because you can...

1274
01:31:29,745 --> 01:31:30,963
but because you must.

1275
01:31:31,834 --> 01:31:33,836
I'’m gonna keep chipping away.

1276
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:36,491
If I can get a quarter inch, I'’ll be able to squeeze through as a worm.

1277
01:31:36,665 --> 01:31:37,883
As a worm!

1278
01:31:38,057 --> 01:31:39,494
As a worm, perfect.

1279
01:31:39,668 --> 01:31:41,670
You see this? Now we have a Plan D if Plan C fails.

1280
01:31:41,844 --> 01:31:43,672
Isn'’t Plan D just Plan B again?

1281
01:31:43,846 --> 01:31:46,936
Plan B has a stink too.It all stinks.

1282
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:49,547
Here. Use this to keep in contact.

1283
01:31:50,461 --> 01:31:52,071
Well, um, this is a rock.

1284
01:31:52,245 --> 01:31:53,551
Actually it is...

1285
01:31:53,725 --> 01:31:55,292
...a sending stone.

1286
01:31:55,466 --> 01:31:56,946
But they'’ll only work for an hour.

1287
01:31:57,773 --> 01:31:59,296
Clever.

1288
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:03,126
So how we gonna get in there?

1289
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:05,389
Easy. We just create a distraction.

1290
01:32:06,390 --> 01:32:08,697
Oh, I got a good feeling about Plan C.

1291
01:32:22,319 --> 01:32:24,060

You sure I can'’t help?I'’m certain.

Mmm, you don'’t have to be so certain.Get her!

1317
01:34:17,826 --> 01:34:20,480
Now listen carefully.

1318
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:23,179
I'’m with the Absolution Council. They'’ve just gone up.

01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,202
Go! Quickly!

1320
01:35:06,396 --> 01:35:07,440
Open up!

1321
01:35:07,614 --> 01:35:09,399
Just a minute!

1322
01:35:29,245 --> 01:35:30,463
I don'’t mind that.

1323
01:35:33,815 --> 01:35:35,294
Okay, you can do this.

1324
01:35:35,468 --> 01:35:37,079
Relax. No rush.

1325
01:35:37,253 --> 01:35:38,820
There he is!

1326
01:35:42,432 --> 01:35:44,913
Look who'’s back. The would-be sorcerer.

1327
01:35:45,087 --> 01:35:48,525
I don'’t have time for this!Yet I have all the time there is.

1328
01:35:48,699 --> 01:35:51,049
You don'’t get it. We'’re going to die if I don'’t attune!

1329
01:35:51,223 --> 01:35:54,183
So you die a fool. It'’s better than to live as one.

1330
01:35:54,357 --> 01:35:56,054
That'’s enough! You don'’t know me.

1331
01:35:56,228 --> 01:35:58,970
I know you'’re a stain on your family name!

1332
01:35:59,144 --> 01:36:01,016
To hell with my name! Let me attune!

1333
01:36:01,190 --> 01:36:03,540
Not while I live.You don'’t live!

1334
01:36:03,714 --> 01:36:05,847
You had your time. Now it'’s my turn.

1335
01:36:06,021 --> 01:36:07,196
I won'’t allow it.

1336
01:36:07,370 --> 01:36:08,675
I don'’t care!

1337
01:36:10,590 --> 01:36:11,635
Sorry.

1338
01:36:16,161 --> 01:36:17,336
Took you long enough.

1339
01:36:33,657 --> 01:36:34,701
Simon!

1340
01:36:36,181 --> 01:36:37,269
Simon, was that you?

1341
01:36:37,443 --> 01:36:39,576
It was! I did it!

1342
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:40,969
Well done.

1343
01:36:42,013 --> 01:36:43,754
I guess it was just me holding me back.

1344
01:36:43,928 --> 01:36:45,364
That'’s what I'’ve been saying!

1345
01:36:54,243 --> 01:36:55,461
I made it inside the vault.

1346
01:36:55,635 --> 01:36:57,289
So did we.

1347
01:36:58,290 --> 01:36:59,988
There'’s nothing here.

1348
01:37:00,162 --> 01:37:02,599
What do you mean? It'’s all here. Where are you?

1349
01:37:02,773 --> 01:37:03,818
Where are you?

1350
01:37:04,601 --> 01:37:06,037
I think I'’m under the arena.

1351
01:37:07,996 --> 01:37:08,953
Forge.

1352
01:37:09,127 --> 01:37:10,476
This one here.

1353
01:37:28,755 --> 01:37:30,235
Oh, that'’s not good.

1354
01:37:38,722 --> 01:37:40,680
Simon! Doric! You there?

1355
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:42,378
What are you doing here?

1356
01:37:43,292 --> 01:37:44,293
Kir!

1357
01:37:46,469 --> 01:37:47,687
I came for you.

1358
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:49,254
We have to go.

1359
01:37:50,168 --> 01:37:51,691
You left me.

1360
01:37:51,866 --> 01:37:55,347
No. No, I know you think I'’m a liar and a bad father,

1361
01:37:55,521 --> 01:37:56,958
but--

1362
01:38:00,352 --> 01:38:01,876
I am a bad father.

1363
01:38:05,227 --> 01:38:07,011
And I did leave you.

1364
01:38:07,185 --> 01:38:09,361
And I wasn'’t trying to bring your mom back.

1365
01:38:09,535 --> 01:38:10,972
I was trying to...

1366
01:38:11,886 --> 01:38:13,583
bring my wife back.

1367
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:17,892
Which if-- maybe if you had gotten a chance to know her

1368
01:38:18,980 --> 01:38:21,417
and love her like I did, you'’d understand.

1369
01:38:21,591 --> 01:38:23,419
But if you come with me now,

1370
01:38:24,333 --> 01:38:25,900
you can have that chance.

1371
01:38:28,859 --> 01:38:29,773
Hmm.

1372
01:38:48,096 --> 01:38:50,837
You'’d think you'’d be able to distinguish between

1373
01:38:51,012 --> 01:38:53,623
your own daughter and a 300-year-old wizard.

1374
01:38:53,797 --> 01:38:55,016
Don'’t worry, Kira'’s safe.

1375
01:38:55,190 --> 01:38:56,974
Unlike me, she had no idea you were coming.

1376
01:38:57,148 --> 01:39:00,760
I don'’t think she knows how tenacious you'’ve become. Huh?

1377
01:39:02,284 --> 01:39:03,850
Look, Ed, um...

1378
01:39:06,853 --> 01:39:09,465
I'’m really sorry about the way things have worked out.

1379
01:39:10,466 --> 01:39:12,729
But I think if you were truly honest,

1380
01:39:12,903 --> 01:39:15,819
you'’d have to admit I can give Kira a better life.

1381
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:18,430
I hope you can take comfort in knowing

1382
01:39:18,604 --> 01:39:20,737
that she'’s with the father she deserves, yeah?

1383
01:39:20,911 --> 01:39:23,566
And now I'’m in a pickle because...

1384
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:25,655
...I don'’t want to see you die.

1385
01:39:26,917 --> 01:39:30,486
Which is why I'’m gonna leave the room.

1386
01:39:33,184 --> 01:39:34,142
What?

1387
01:39:42,802 --> 01:39:45,283
If you'’re gonna kill us, at least let us die with dignity.

1388
01:39:45,457 --> 01:39:48,460
How do you mean?Put us in the High Sun Games.

1389
01:39:48,634 --> 01:39:51,028
Give us a fighting chance.That'’s not a chance.

1390
01:39:51,202 --> 01:39:52,987
It'’s not a chance at all.

1391
01:39:53,161 --> 01:39:56,077
I mean, even if you were to somehow survive the tournament,

1392
01:39:56,251 --> 01:39:57,687
Sofina'’s gonna...

1393
01:40:00,690 --> 01:40:03,998
It would be much, much better for you to die here than to go to the games.

1394
01:40:04,172 --> 01:40:07,566
No. They defeated your men and mine.

1395
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:09,394
Let them fight in the arena.

1396
01:40:10,265 --> 01:40:12,223
They deserve that much.

1397
01:40:14,617 --> 01:40:16,880
...to the games?

1398
01:40:17,054 --> 01:40:20,275
Oh. Yeah. That was sort of a bad day.

1399
01:40:20,449 --> 01:40:21,493
Oh.

1400
01:40:21,667 --> 01:40:23,191
You might want to go back to sleep.

1401
01:40:23,365 --> 01:40:24,540
Are we...

1402
01:40:24,714 --> 01:40:26,716
In the arena.

1403
01:40:28,587 --> 01:40:31,242
This dummy talked Forge into putting us in the games.

1404
01:40:31,416 --> 01:40:33,114
Dummy? I saved our lives!

1405
01:40:33,288 --> 01:40:35,116
And I got us right above where Doric said the treasure was.

1406
01:40:35,290 --> 01:40:37,770
Isn'’t it a little suspect that Sofina would agree to this?

1407
01:40:37,944 --> 01:40:40,817
Yeah, she'’s definitely planned something.

1408
01:40:40,991 --> 01:40:42,732
Where under the arena were you?

1409
01:40:43,428 --> 01:40:44,777
Do you remember?

1410
01:40:45,561 --> 01:40:46,649
Not sure.

1411
01:40:47,998 --> 01:40:49,739
There was a dock down there.

1412
01:40:49,913 --> 01:40:52,742
I saw guards loading everything onto a ship.

1413
01:40:54,657 --> 01:40:58,443
A ship. Forge wasn'’t hiding the loot from us.

1414
01:40:58,617 --> 01:41:00,576
He was stealing it for himself.

1415
01:41:00,750 --> 01:41:03,622
He never cared about being Lord. That just gave him access to the vault.

1416
01:41:03,796 --> 01:41:06,277
He must have brought back the games so the take would be bigger.

1417
01:41:07,931 --> 01:41:12,501
What about Kira?He won'’t leave her behind. We have to get to that boat.

1418
01:41:12,675 --> 01:41:16,461
I don'’t understand. If Forge is leaving, what does Sofina get out of this?

1419
01:41:24,948 --> 01:41:26,776
Maybe I can get us out of here.

1420
01:41:30,214 --> 01:41:33,261
Magic suppression cuff. They put one on me too.

1421
01:41:33,435 --> 01:41:35,480
And just when you were getting good at it.

1422
01:42:36,237 --> 01:42:38,064
So we just go through the maze?

1423
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:40,154
I guess till we reach the cage?

1424
01:42:46,290 --> 01:42:47,291
Run!

1425
01:42:51,991 --> 01:42:53,167
Find the cage!

1426
01:43:02,567 --> 01:43:03,655
Follow me!

1427
01:43:13,796 --> 01:43:14,840
Whoa, whoa!

1428
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:00,495
Thanks.

1429
01:44:03,193 --> 01:44:05,587
-Where are the others? -Come on, this way.

1430
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:13,334
Have you tried Displacer Beast meat?

1431
01:44:14,073 --> 01:44:15,858
No. It'’s too gamey for me.

1432
01:44:17,860 --> 01:44:19,514
The ship is ready, sir.

1433
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:28,523
It seems my ship is ready, so...

1434
01:44:29,524 --> 01:44:32,048
Kira and I will be taking our leave.

1435
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:38,359
I do hope that our collaboration has been as gratifying for you as it has for--

1436
01:44:38,533 --> 01:44:40,491
Get out of my city.

1437
01:44:40,665 --> 01:44:41,884
Right.

1438
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:47,411
Get out of the way!

1439
01:44:48,238 --> 01:44:49,413
It'’s burning!

1440
01:44:55,027 --> 01:44:57,029
Another minute, I would have lost my hand.

1441
01:44:57,203 --> 01:44:58,814
Yeah, but look what you did lose.

1442
01:44:59,554 --> 01:45:00,511
Come on.

1443
01:45:00,685 --> 01:45:02,470
Doric? Doric!

1444
01:45:02,644 --> 01:45:04,776
There must be a way to get out of the arena.

1445
01:45:22,185 --> 01:45:23,534
Come on! Come on!

1446
01:45:34,328 --> 01:45:35,459
Yeah. Come on!

1447
01:45:37,243 --> 01:45:38,941
No.

1448
01:45:39,115 --> 01:45:41,204
No, this isn'’t the way out.

1449
01:45:41,378 --> 01:45:43,598
Yes, it is.If we survive this, there'’ll be another challenge and another

1450
01:45:43,772 --> 01:45:45,730
until every last person in that cage is dead.

1451
01:45:45,904 --> 01:45:47,732
We have to find a work-around.

1452
01:45:50,126 --> 01:45:52,215
I'’ve got an idea. Follow me.

1453
01:45:52,389 --> 01:45:53,695
No! Come back!

1454
01:45:53,869 --> 01:45:56,132
Hey! What'’s your idea?

1455
01:46:03,487 --> 01:46:05,097
When we hear the gong, we jump in.

1456
01:46:05,271 --> 01:46:06,490
Into this thing?

1457
01:46:06,664 --> 01:46:08,536
You want to end up like that guy?

1458
01:46:08,710 --> 01:46:10,886
We will only be inside for a few seconds.

1459
01:46:14,324 --> 01:46:16,413
Well, If we'’re all inside, who'’s gonna pull us out?

1460
01:46:16,587 --> 01:46:18,589
-I will, trust me. -Always.

1461
01:46:18,763 --> 01:46:20,069
Hold.

1462
01:46:23,289 --> 01:46:24,726
Hold.

1463
01:46:26,771 --> 01:46:27,816
Hold!

1464
01:46:27,990 --> 01:46:30,079
Now!

1465
01:47:03,460 --> 01:47:05,506
Damn it! That stings!

1466
01:47:16,386 --> 01:47:18,823
We got to move.

1467
01:47:27,179 --> 01:47:28,398
I'’ve been here.

1468
01:47:29,051 --> 01:47:30,356
Our gear.

1469
01:47:33,621 --> 01:47:35,927
Simon. Try these on your cuff.

1470
01:47:38,277 --> 01:47:39,627
Come with me.

1471
01:47:41,237 --> 01:47:43,152
Quite a second date, yeah?

1472
01:47:57,166 --> 01:47:59,081
-A trip? -Yes.

1473
01:47:59,255 --> 01:48:01,387
Something urgent has come up, but if we leave now we'’ll be safe.

1474
01:48:01,562 --> 01:48:02,563
Safe from what?

1475
01:48:04,782 --> 01:48:07,306
What is this?This is an ambush.

1476
01:48:07,481 --> 01:48:09,700
On the boat you were gonna use to escape from Neverwinter.

1477
01:48:09,874 --> 01:48:11,310
Dad.Hi, honey.

1478
01:48:11,485 --> 01:48:13,791
Hey, Forge, why don'’t you tell her what this is?

1479
01:48:15,314 --> 01:48:18,187
I don'’t know.It'’s the Tablet of Reawakening, Kira.

1480
01:48:18,361 --> 01:48:20,276
It'’s the reason why I left you.

1481
01:48:20,450 --> 01:48:22,408
Your dad'’s been telling you the truth, Bug.

1482
01:48:22,583 --> 01:48:25,063
It'’s Uncle Forge who'’s been feeding you lies.

1483
01:48:26,891 --> 01:48:29,198
It'’s rubbish. It'’s just rubbish!

1484
01:48:29,372 --> 01:48:30,852
Come with me, Kir.

1485
01:48:31,809 --> 01:48:34,072
We'’ll go home, bring back Mom.

1486
01:48:35,247 --> 01:48:37,206
We can be a family again.

1487
01:48:40,905 --> 01:48:42,211
You'’re not taking my money.

1488
01:48:44,082 --> 01:48:46,432
Put down the tablet and get off my ship, all of you.

1489
01:48:46,607 --> 01:48:48,652
Now!Okay. Okay. Okay.

1490
01:48:48,826 --> 01:48:50,175
What are you doing?

1491
01:48:50,349 --> 01:48:51,699
It'’s all right. Shush, my darling, be quiet.

1492
01:48:51,873 --> 01:48:53,570
It'’s going down. Just don'’t hurt her.

1493
01:48:53,744 --> 01:48:55,137
See that, Kira?

1494
01:48:55,311 --> 01:48:57,269
Your father knows me.

1495
01:48:57,443 --> 01:49:00,490
He knows I'’m prepared to do terrible things

1496
01:49:00,664 --> 01:49:02,057
to get what I want.

1497
01:49:02,884 --> 01:49:05,582
Even to those I care about most.

1498
01:49:07,366 --> 01:49:10,848
In the end, that'’s all that separates the beggar--

1499
01:49:23,774 --> 01:49:25,559
Nobody hurts my Bug.

1500
01:49:27,604 --> 01:49:29,171
Simon, get us out of here!

1501
01:49:36,657 --> 01:49:38,049
Sorry, Ed.

1502
01:49:43,098 --> 01:49:44,403
Sorry, Forge!

1503
01:49:59,027 --> 01:50:00,681
What'’s that one on about?Who knows?

1504
01:50:00,855 --> 01:50:02,508
Twenty thousand on the Gray Hands!

1505
01:50:08,645 --> 01:50:10,342
I'’m sorry I believed him.

1506
01:50:11,779 --> 01:50:13,650
What? What are you talking about?

1507
01:50:13,824 --> 01:50:16,784
You have nothing to apologize for.

1508
01:50:16,958 --> 01:50:19,874
I should have done so many things differently.

1509
01:50:21,179 --> 01:50:24,443
I had a whole apology, but I sort of gave it to Sofina.

1510
01:50:25,793 --> 01:50:27,838
I love you, Kir.

1511
01:50:28,012 --> 01:50:31,189
And nothing will ever get in the way of that again, okay?

1512
01:50:31,712 --> 01:50:32,713
Promise.

1513
01:50:38,153 --> 01:50:40,329
I love you too, Dad.

1514
01:50:40,503 --> 01:50:42,940
It'’s good to have you back, kid.

1515
01:50:43,114 --> 01:50:45,943
Do you know how much loot is on this ship?

1516
01:50:47,815 --> 01:50:49,077
I'’m surprised the boat can float.

1517
01:50:49,251 --> 01:50:52,384
All right. So, we'’re gonna need to lay low.

1518
01:50:53,037 --> 01:50:54,517
What is that?

1519
01:51:07,443 --> 01:51:09,358
It'’s the Beckoning Death.

1520
01:51:09,532 --> 01:51:11,882
That'’s why she needed Forge.

1521
01:51:12,056 --> 01:51:14,668
The games brought the city together for the spell.

1522
01:51:15,581 --> 01:51:17,888
Szass Tam is taking Neverwinter.

1523
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:29,421
Well, shit.

1524
01:51:38,517 --> 01:51:40,519
So what do we do when we get there?

1525
01:51:40,694 --> 01:51:44,045
Working on it. Simon, what did you say the range was in that portal staff?

1526
01:51:44,219 --> 01:51:46,047
A quarter mile. Why?

1527
01:51:47,178 --> 01:51:49,920
I'’m gonna keep that promise I made to Xenk.

1528
01:51:58,537 --> 01:52:00,670
Whatever that is, stop it. Now!

1529
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:06,110
Look! She'’s Thayan!

1530
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:10,245
Please! Please stop!

1531
01:52:31,527 --> 01:52:34,486
You there! Harbor master person.Are you seeing this?

1532
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:37,228
As Lord of Neverwinter, I demand a ship and crew

1533
01:52:37,402 --> 01:52:39,578
to chase down five people who have--

1534
01:52:46,324 --> 01:52:48,500
What is this? No!

1535
01:52:58,815 --> 01:53:01,035
It'’s the gift Forge promised!

1536
01:53:20,402 --> 01:53:22,099
No! No! No!

1537
01:53:22,273 --> 01:53:24,798
No, no, no! No! No!

1538
01:53:24,972 --> 01:53:26,800
No!

1539
01:53:28,497 --> 01:53:30,281
That'’s for you. Enjoy that.

1540
01:53:31,152 --> 01:53:32,153
All right.

1541
01:53:33,154 --> 01:53:35,069
This isn'’t over until we take her out.

1542
01:53:36,026 --> 01:53:38,420
Whatever happens to us, stay hidden.

1543
01:53:39,073 --> 01:53:40,335
Use your pendant.

1544
01:53:51,172 --> 01:53:53,000
Where do you think she'’s gone?

1545
01:54:32,691 --> 01:54:33,997
She missed.

1546
01:55:49,159 --> 01:55:50,378
You all right?

1547
01:56:08,222 --> 01:56:09,788
What do we do when we get to her?

1548
01:56:09,963 --> 01:56:11,181
I got this.

1549
01:57:16,333 --> 01:57:18,596
You know not the scope of my power!

1550
01:57:35,483 --> 01:57:37,137
Enough!

1551
01:57:40,270 --> 01:57:42,011
It'’s another Time Stop!

1552
01:57:42,185 --> 01:57:45,232
Simon, can you counter it?I can'’t. She'’s still too strong!

1553
01:57:45,884 --> 01:57:47,147
I'’m so sorr--

1554
01:57:51,455 --> 01:57:53,240
For too long

1555
01:57:53,414 --> 01:57:56,721
I endured the arrogance of Forge Fitzwilliam.

1556
01:57:56,895 --> 01:57:58,767
The false charm.

1557
01:57:58,941 --> 01:58:01,204
The quips.

1558
01:58:01,378 --> 01:58:04,077
And just as I begin to purge this place

1559
01:58:04,251 --> 01:58:08,385
of its living filth, you dare interpose.

1560
01:58:12,128 --> 01:58:15,392
Now, as you die,

1561
01:58:15,566 --> 01:58:18,003
rest assured it will not be the end.

1562
01:58:18,787 --> 01:58:23,357
For you will forever suffer.

1563
01:58:25,663 --> 01:58:29,102
I'’m sorry, your breath just smells like... old clothes.

1564
01:58:29,276 --> 01:58:30,712
It'’s bad.

1565
01:58:35,543 --> 01:58:36,761
What is this?

1566
01:58:36,935 --> 01:58:39,721
I countered your Time Stop. I got better.

1567
01:58:39,895 --> 01:58:42,680
We had to distract you so Kira could slap on that cuff

1568
01:58:42,854 --> 01:58:44,682
and so Doric could do this.

1569
01:58:50,862 --> 01:58:52,516
I think you got her.

1570
01:59:05,094 --> 01:59:07,879
I honestly didn'’t think that plan was gonna work.

1571
01:59:08,576 --> 01:59:10,317
You assured us it would.

1572
01:59:10,491 --> 01:59:12,188
Hey, Holga!

1573
01:59:16,105 --> 01:59:18,063
Did we get her?Holga?

1574
01:59:19,021 --> 01:59:21,980
Yeah. Yeah, we got her.

1575
01:59:22,807 --> 01:59:24,113
Oh, that'’s...Oh, God.

1576
01:59:24,287 --> 01:59:25,636
That'’s not a good spot, is it?

1577
01:59:25,810 --> 01:59:27,812
No, it'’s not-- it'’s not bad.

1578
01:59:28,987 --> 01:59:29,901
Here.

1579
01:59:30,075 --> 01:59:32,121
Simon! Simon, help her.

1580
01:59:33,383 --> 01:59:36,734
It'’s a Red Wizard'’s blade. There'’s nothing I can do.

1581
01:59:39,346 --> 01:59:41,043
Hey. Hey.

1582
01:59:41,217 --> 01:59:42,784
We'’re gonna patch you up. It'’s not gonna be a problem.

1583
01:59:42,958 --> 01:59:44,133
Please don'’t go.

1584
01:59:45,090 --> 01:59:46,831
Easy, Bug, easy.Please don'’t go.

1585
01:59:47,005 --> 01:59:48,224
Don'’t mourn me.

1586
01:59:48,398 --> 01:59:50,444
No, no, no. No final words.

1587
01:59:50,618 --> 01:59:53,142
No final words.I'’m proud of what I did here.

1588
01:59:53,316 --> 01:59:55,405
I'’m dying a hero.

1589
01:59:56,711 --> 01:59:58,321
And you...

1590
02:00:00,367 --> 02:00:01,846
You'’re a good man.

1591
02:00:02,499 --> 02:00:04,022
A real Harper.

1592
02:00:05,023 --> 02:00:07,200
Shut up. I'’m a moron, you know that.

1593
02:00:07,852 --> 02:00:09,332
Promise me something.

1594
02:00:10,159 --> 02:00:11,595
Yeah, anything.

1595
02:00:11,769 --> 02:00:14,424
That you'’re gonna take good care of our girl.

1596
02:00:15,773 --> 02:00:18,211
She'’s the best thing you ever did.

1597
02:00:19,995 --> 02:00:21,431
I will.

1604
02:00:50,373 --> 02:00:51,548
No.

1605
02:00:52,854 --> 02:00:54,072
No!

1606
02:00:55,160 --> 02:00:56,901
I need you.

1607
02:00:59,034 --> 02:01:01,515
I need you.

1608
02:01:58,267 --> 02:02:00,617
We can only use it once.

1609
02:02:04,099 --> 02:02:05,143
I know.

1610
02:02:13,804 --> 02:02:14,936
Holga Kilgore.

1611
02:02:31,735 --> 02:02:34,521
Don'’t tell me you wasted it on me.

1612
02:02:36,261 --> 02:02:37,785
Why would you do that?

1613
02:03:00,285 --> 02:03:02,853
Szass Tam won'’t be happy about this.

1614
02:03:03,027 --> 02:03:04,725
Well, if he comes after us, we'’ll be ready.

1615
02:03:04,899 --> 02:03:06,553
We?

1616
02:03:06,727 --> 02:03:08,685
Oh, that'’s right. You don'’t like humans, do you?

1617
02:03:10,992 --> 02:03:12,123
Some are okay.

1618
02:03:13,951 --> 02:03:15,562
What about you?Hmm?

1619
02:03:15,736 --> 02:03:18,608
Going back to the Harpers? Be with your people?

1620
02:03:20,305 --> 02:03:21,916
I'’m with my people.

1621
02:03:24,092 --> 02:03:25,833
So, uh,

1622
02:03:26,007 --> 02:03:30,228
I know my last attempt to court you was quite bad.

1623
02:03:30,403 --> 02:03:34,102
But I wonder if you'’d consider having another go at it?

1624
02:03:36,713 --> 02:03:37,845
Yeah, all right.Yeah?

1625
02:03:38,019 --> 02:03:39,760
Calm down.Right.

1626
02:03:47,768 --> 02:03:50,161
Damn! Bloody chalice.

1627
02:04:08,745 --> 02:04:10,051
Good evening.

1628
02:04:11,574 --> 02:04:13,837
Of course, you know what happened after that.

1629
02:04:14,011 --> 02:04:15,926
With Sofina'’s magic expunged,

1630
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:18,059
Lord Neverember finally came to.

1631
02:04:20,235 --> 02:04:22,237
His first official act was to award

1632
02:04:22,411 --> 02:04:25,370
the saviors of Neverwinter the Medal of Heroism.

1633
02:04:26,415 --> 02:04:28,112
And to the Emerald Enclave,

1634
02:04:28,286 --> 02:04:31,768
he granted formal protection of their people and their land.

1635
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:41,212
One could argue that my actions, reprehensible though they were,

1636
02:04:41,386 --> 02:04:43,998
led to a virtual renaissance for the city.

1637
02:04:44,172 --> 02:04:47,567
And while I'’ve only served the first year of my sentence, I have to say,

1638
02:04:47,741 --> 02:04:49,003
it has been

1639
02:04:50,134 --> 02:04:51,484
eye-opening.

1640
02:04:52,572 --> 02:04:55,052
I have taken a look inside

1641
02:04:55,749 --> 02:04:57,402
and I'’ve asked myself,

1642
02:04:58,447 --> 02:04:59,840
"What'’s going on in there?"

1643
02:05:01,189 --> 02:05:06,411
And, you know, I realized a lot of it goes back to my mum.

1644
02:05:07,674 --> 02:05:10,241
She was a stern woman, prone to fits of--

1645
02:05:10,415 --> 02:05:12,505
Stop, stop! We'’ve heard enough.

1646
02:05:14,245 --> 02:05:16,117
Pardon denied.

1647
02:05:16,291 --> 02:05:18,728
This session is adjourned.

1648
02:05:23,646 --> 02:05:24,647
Jarnathan!

1649
02:05:30,261 --> 02:05:32,394
No, no! I'’m terribly sorry.

1650
02:05:32,568 --> 02:05:35,484
I don'’t know what came over me, I'’m sorry. I'’m sorry!

1651
02:07:47,311 --> 02:07:48,486
Hello?

1652
02:07:50,097 --> 02:07:53,143
Can somebody please ask me another question?

1653
02:07:54,579 --> 02:07:55,624
Anyone?
