1
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,200
[Szass Tam] I sense your impacience.

2
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:24,800
[Sofina] The wild shape must be in cahoots
with Forge's former companions.

3
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,500
[Dralas] Maybe Forge is working against us?

4
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,500
[Sofina] As long as I get some benefit,

5
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,100
[Sofina] it will not interfere with
the conquest of Szass Tam.

6
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,200
[Dralas] I will find those thieves.

7
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,000
[Sofina] Before you go,

8
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,400
[Sofina] The men behind us let them escape.

9
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
[Dralas] Understood.

10
01:09:55,400 --> 01:10:01,000
[Dralas] You got old, Yendar.
It must be because of the disgusting mortal blood.

11
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:06,560
[Xenk] And you, Dralas, you look as bad
as the last time I saw you.

12
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:12,400
[Dralas] Well, I'll make sure we don't
see each other again.

13
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,700
[Dralas] Ready for another fight, Yendar?
