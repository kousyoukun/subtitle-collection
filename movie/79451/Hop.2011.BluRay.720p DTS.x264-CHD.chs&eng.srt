但是你们也没否定啊
You're not denying it.

134
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,455
吃你的饭吧
Eat your dinner.

135
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,255
老妈 老爸 我正在努力 好吧
我在进行面试 今天就有一个
Mom, Dad, I'm trying, okay?
I go on job interviews. I had one today!

136
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,138
没错  但那不是你在寻找的
Yes, but it wasn't what you were
looking for. It's always something.

137
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,539
你不喜欢上下班
You didn't like the commute.

138
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,690
停车场离楼栋太远了
The parking lot was too far away from the building.

139
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,092
你旁边小隔间的那个男的有体味
The man in the cubicle next to you smelled.

140
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,494
-他确实有体味
-Fred
-He smelled.
-Fred,

141
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,059
对你来说 什么都不够好
nothing is ever good enough for you.

142
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,533
你不想我稳定下来 是吗
You don't want me to settle, do you?

143
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,735
稳定很好
Settling is fine.

144
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,137
老爸 当我还是小孩的时候
Dad, when I was a kid,

145
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,336
你说过当我长大了 我要做些大事
you said that when I grew up I was going to do something great.

146
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,657
没错 但是我现在要告诉你的是 你必须要忘掉"伟大"
Yes. But now I'm telling you
that you should forget about "great,"

147
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,533
而愿意接受任何一种工作
and settle for getting any job.

148
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,252
很早以前我们就应该刺激你的
We should have nudged you out of the nest a long time ago.

149
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,739
小鸟需要轻推一下
Baby birds get a nudge.

150
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,770
大鸟不愿离巢的  他们会受到猛推
Giant birds who never leave,they get shoved.

151
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,735
(ROCK SONG PLAYING)

152
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,295
E.B.
E.B.!

153
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,973
E.B.
E.B.!

154
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,493
嗨  老爸  你觉得我演奏得如何
Hello, Dad. So, what do you think?

155
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,972
呃... 我...
很棒 很有冲劲儿
Uh, what did I...
It was great! Really kicking.

156
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,372
但是E.B.  你不是应该排练你的演讲吗
But, E.B., shouldn't you be rehearsing your speech?

157
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,337
你将被3000个同胞们
You're about to be crowned the Easter Bunny

158
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,138
簇拥着
in front of 3,000 of your peers.

159
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,975
呃 耶  关于那个
Uh, yeah, about that.

160
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,499
是吗
Yes?

161
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,417
停着  老爸
Look, Dad, 

162
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,978
ever since I was yea big, it's been,

163
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,176
"复活节兔"不会那样做
"The Easter Bunny wouldn't do that" and

164
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,490
"复活节兔必须是完美的"
"The Easter Bunny has to be perfect."

165
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,808
但是  我不是完美的
But I'm not perfect.

166
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,414
我知道 儿子  但是你最终会达到的
I know that, Son. But you'll get there, eventually.

167
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,728
但是 我...
But I'm...

168
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,809
听着 你想让我变成这样
Listen. You want me to be this.

169
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,170
但是 也许我不是这样
But maybe I'm not this.

170
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,172
只是可能 可能我会是这样
Just maybe, maybe I'm this.

171
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,813
一只袜子?
A sock? 

172
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,935
呃.
Ugh.

173
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,097
对 没错  我可能就是那只比喻的袜子
Yeah, that's right.
I might be a metaphorical sock.

174
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,337
也许我不是一个足够好的彩蛋
I might not be a good enough egg,

175
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,297
但我可能是最好的袜子
but I might be the best sock ever.

176
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,208
I might not cut it delivering Easter baskets,

177
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,609
但 我可能擅长其他的东西
but I might be great at something else.

178
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,814
哦  打鼓   我觉得那很好
Oh, the drums! Why, I think that's fine.

179
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,698
我认为你有一个爱好真的很不错
每个人应该都有一个爱好
I think it's really nice that you have a hobby.
Everyone should have a hobby.

180
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,771
老爸 它不是一个爱好
It's not a hobby, Dad.

181
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,211
我想在乐队里打鼓
我想见识这个世界
I want to drum in a band.
I want to see the world.

182
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,729
E.B.  复活节兔能看到全世界
E.B., the Easter Bunny sees the world.

183
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,779
一晚走遍所有国家 让全世界的人们快乐
Every country in one night,
making people of the world happy.

184
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,409
真的吗  老爸  全世界?
Really, Dad? The whole world?

185
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,571
中国怎么样
What about China?

186
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,528
(妇女用中文叫喊着)
(WOMAN YELLING IN MANDARIN)

187
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,179
不要
No!

188
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,495
看  这是糖果  妇女
Look, it's candy, woman!

189
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,132
请叫女士
Madam, please.

190
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,379
好吧  我们还没攻破中国
All right. So,
we haven't cracked China yet.

191
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,896
但是  对所有那些相信(复活节)的国家
你会到那儿去的
But, for all those that do believe,
you will be there.

192
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,448
不  老爸 我不想成为复活节兔子
No, Dad. I don't want to be the Easter Bunny.

193
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,013
听我说
Now, listen to me.

194
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,734
4000年的传统不会
Four thousand years of tradition doesn't end

195
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,096
只是因为一只自私的小兔子不愿意做而结束
just because one selfish bunny doesn't feel like doing it.

196
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,215
听着  老爸
Look. Dad...

197
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,415
不  E.B.  你听着
No, E.B., you look!

198
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,650
你将成为复活节兔
You are going to be the Easter Bunny!

199
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,409
现在你需要摆脱这些鼓
Now you need to get it together,get rid of these drums,

200
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,252
首要任务是复活节
and get your priorities straight!

201
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,779
我去外面等你
I'll see you out there!

202
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,290
不  我不认为你能（见到我）
No, I don't think you will.

203
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,656
终点  梦想成真的地方
Destination. Where dreams come true.

204
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,771
飞行快餐偏好
In-flight snack preference.

205
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,371
有行李吗? 只是有些情绪
Any baggage? Just emotional.

206
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,499
老爸 对不起
I'm sorry, Dad.

207
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,375


208
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,935


209
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,495
噢
Ow!

210
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,933
我做到了
I did it.

211
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,293
好莱坞
Hollywood.

212
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,173
嗯 第一件事情 找个住的地方
Right. First order of business,find a place to stay.

213
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,815
太完美了
Perfect.

214
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,538
Fred等等  等等 Fred
Fred, wait, wait, wait! Fred.

215
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,289
你事先知道这些吗? Sam
Did you know about this, Sam?

216
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,535
哦 嗯....
Oh, uh...

217
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,894
你果然知道  好吧  听着
You did. Okay, look.

218
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,096
The rules of this intervention state

219
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,251
that I am not supposed to help you, okay?

220
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,853
所以你不能告诉别人我将要做的事
So you can't tell anyone what I'm about to do.

221
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,295
不 我不会从你这儿拿钱的
No! I'm not going to take money from you.

222
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,818
不是要给你钱
Wasn't going to give you money.

223
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,292
-我们可以叫它贷款
-Fred 听着
-We can call it a loan.
-Fred, look,

224
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,014

225
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,329
我明天会有点受打击的
I'm a little slammed tomorrow.

226
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,529
我知道你不会的
I know you're not.

227
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,099
-我很忙
-不
-I'm pretty busy.
-No.

228
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,091
听着，它是最低级的职位
Look, it's an entry-level position.

229
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,977
-最低级的?
-在一个视频游戏公司
-Entry-level?
-At a video game company!

230
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,248
-好吧，那很酷
-我知道
-Okay. That's kind of cool.
-I know.

231
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,373
好吧 听着 如果这对你意义很大  我会变通的
All right, look, if it means that much to you, I'll swing by.

232
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,690
不是 Fred 你不会的  好吗
No, Fred. You don't "swing by." Okay?

233
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,295
你洗个澡 刮刮胡子 然后露个面 
You shower, you shave, and you show up.


234
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,690
加油 Fred  你已经开始了你的生活
Come on, Fred. You've got to start your life.

235
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,578
-你可以把这个当作重新启动
-好吧
-Think of this as a reboot.
-Right!

236
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,614
是时候了
It's time.

237
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,299
是的 你知道吗 你是对的
Yeah. You know what? You're right.

238
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,456
在几个星期 几个月后
In a couple of months, couple of weeks,

239
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,656
你会见到一个全新的Fred
you're gonna see a whole new Fred.

240
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,574
没错 就是复活节的时候  离复活节还有2个星期
Yeah. By Easter. Easter is in two weeks.

241
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,016
复活节的时候 我将会有一个新工作 新地方 新生活
By Easter, I'm going to have a new job,
a new place, a new life.

242
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,169
-好极了
-好的
-Great!
-Okay.

243
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,976
现在 不过你不介意的话
Now if you'll excuse me,

244
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,254
我要去车里睡觉了
I'm going to go sleep in my car.

245
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,294
Fred 听着
Fred, listen.

246
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,009
我的老板会渡假几个星期  他让我代为照看房子
My boss is on vacation for a few weeks
and he asked me to house-sit.

247
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,812
从没有人叫我代为照看房子
Nobody ever asks me to house-sit.

248
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,379
我知道 这怪怪的
I know. It's so weird.

249
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,093
不管怎样 他有很多狗
Anyway, he has dogs,

250
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,252
而且你知道我怕狗的 
所以你替我去吧
and you know I'm scared of dogs,
so take over for me.

251
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,732
等等 你老板住在一栋豪宅里,对吧
Wait. Your boss lives in a big mansion, right?

252
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,089
是的 在贝佛利山庄 (美国加州 好莱坞明星集居地) 
Yes, in Beverly Hills.

253
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,091
而且他爱他的房子胜过他的孩子
And he loves his house more than he loves his kids.

254
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,057
所以你必须注意自己的行为 好吗
So you have to behave. Okay?

255
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,096
别摸任何东西
不能打碎任何东西
Do not touch anything.
Do not break anything.

256
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,374
千万不要上楼

257
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,655
等等 什么是上楼
Wait, what's upstairs?

258
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,299
-Fred

-Okay.

259
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,854
别忘了喂狗
And do not forget to feed the dogs.

260
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,015
知道了
Got it!

261
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,019
-谢谢你 Sam
-不客气
-Thank you, Sam.
-You're welcome.

262
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,334
地址我写在报纸上了
I put the address on the paper.

263
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,489
好的
Okay.

264
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,652
-但是 Fred
-什么
-But, Fred?
-Yeah?

265
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,015
如果你搞砸了 我会杀了你
If you screw up, I'll kill you.

266
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,455


267
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,655
好的
Okay.

268
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,852
HUGH HEFNER: 听着 这是花花公子的豪宅 不是酒店
HUGH HEFNER: Listen to me. This is the Playboy Mansion. 
It's not a hotel.

269
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,095
耶 没错
Yeah, right.

270
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,297
但是这上面说自从1971年以来
But it says here that ever since 1971,

271
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,336
花花公子大厦就是
the Playboy Mansion has been home

272
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,377
来自全世界的兔女郎的家
to sexy bunnies from around the world.

273
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,180
朋友  我看不到你
请向前一步
Friend, I can't see you.
Please step forward.

274
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,609
现在 我告诉你我也是一只兔子 
而且非常性感 
Now, I'm telling you that I am both a bunny
and incredibly sexy.

275
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,531
我没时间陪你
I don't have time for this.

276
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,294
喂  喂
Hello? Hello?

277
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,131
也许这是我从贫穷到暴富的故事的贫穷的那部分
Maybe this is the rags part of my rags-to-riches story.

278
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,812
(BALLAD PLAYING)

279
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,492
FRED: 没错  就是这儿了 
FRED: All right, let's see here.54 Broadway Terrace.

280
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,936
哇 看这个
Whoa! Look at this!

281
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,617
你好 Fred的新住所
Hello, Fred's new crib.

282
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,179
也许这是件好事
Maybe this is a good thing.

283
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,013
所有伟大的艺术家成名前都会遭受苦难
All great artists suffer before they become famous.

284
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,614
那位女士在通道里写出了《哈利波特》
That lady wrote Harry Potter in a ditch.

285
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,691
但是这种饥饿感  孤独感
But it's the hunger, the loneliness

286
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,851
和精疲力竭让你感觉更真实
and exhaustion that gets you really.

287
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,172
还有比这夜晚更糟的么
How could this night get any worse?

288
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,451
我想想  车祸  谢谢
I see. Car accident. Thank you!

289
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,609


290
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,735
哇噢
Ow!

291
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,135
为什么
Why?

292
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,969
噢 哦呜
Oh, ow!

293
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,734
还是活的
It's still alive.

294
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,931
我要救他
I've got to help him out.

295
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,409
这个应该有用
This will do.

296
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,059
别担心 小朋友
Don't you worry, little friend.

297
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,209
我会解救你于苦难之中的
I'm going to end your suffering.

298
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,809

  
299
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,129
不要
No!

300
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,294
谁在说话
Who said that?

301
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,298
E.B.:嗯 你觉得是谁
E.B.: Well, who do you think said it?

302
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,291
你最新的受害者
Your latest victim.

303
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,495
你知道吗 我们可以不用保险公司来处理
You know what? We can leave
the insurance companies out of this.

304
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,135
我可以 也许过来和你一起住几个月 
I could just, maybe, come live with you
for a couple of months.

305
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,489


306
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,009


307
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,129
不 不 不
不是真的 不是真的 不是真的
No, no, no!
Not real. Not real. Not real.

308
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,249
(PANTING)

309
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,255
-Excuse me?

310
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,658
你把车留在那儿了 灯还没关呢
You left your car back there,
with the lights on.

311
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,294
我只是说说而已
I'm just saying!

312
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,053


313
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,055


314
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,055


315
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,375


316
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,412
说点什么 继续聊天
Say something. Talk again.

317
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,255
我是E.B. 你是?
I'm E.B. And you are?

318
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,419
我是Fred
I'm Fred.

319
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,095
嗯 Fred 我很饿
Well, Fred, I am so hungry.

320
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,330
你在老快餐店有没找到吃的
Have you got anything
in the old snack department?

321
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,215
好的
Okay.

322
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,333
给你
Here you go.

323
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,455
噢  噢  那是....
Oh! Oh! That's... 

324
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,929
这是什么
What is this?

325
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,939
什么 这是土耳其肉干
What? It's Turkey Jerky.

326
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,455
你先是开车撞了我 然后
First, you hit me with your car,
and then you try and poison me

327
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,218
你想用肉干毒死我
with a meat stick.

328
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,415
你为什么恨我
Why do you hate me?

329
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,578
好吧, 你想吃什么 你个奇怪的小东西
Okay. Is there something you'd
rather eat, you weird little thing?

330
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,088
嗯....
Well...

331
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,529
胡萝卜
Carrots!

332
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,769
他真是个天才
He's a genius.

333
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,217
一个胡萝卜 好的
One carrot. Okay.

334
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,293
是时候远离Fred的生活 回到魔法深林了
Time to hop away out of Fred's life
back to the Enchanted Forest.

335
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,130
你要赶我出去?
You're kicking me out?

336
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,213
耶  真不是时候
Yeah. It's a bad time.

337
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,494
耶 有没哪个混蛋刚才开车撞了你
Yeah. Did some jerk
just hit you with his car?

338
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,451
那种时候
That kind of bad time?

339
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,731
不过  我告诉你  没事
No, I'll tell you what. It's fine.

340
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,731
噢  我的腿 哦呜
Oh, me leg. Ow.

341
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,497
我的意思是 不能指望你帮助
I mean, you can't be expected to help

342
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,616
所有被你伤害的无辜生物
every innocent creature you wound.

343
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,812
如果我撞凹了你的保险杠  非常道歉
And I'm sorry if I dented your bumper
with my face and body.

344
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,290
你想让我找些婴儿用的阿司匹林吗
Do you want me to look for some baby aspirin?

345
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,577
不 不 算了吧 也许你辗过一个婴儿
No, no! You save it. You might run over a baby.

346
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:15,176
祈祷死亡使者快点到来
Just pray that sweet messenger
of death visits quickly.

347
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,012
就是那只冰冷的手吗
Is that the icy hand now?

348
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,852
好吧 等等
Okay, wait!

349
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:26,096
考虑到你真的在这儿而我也没疯
On the off-chance that you're really
here and I'm not completely crazy,

350
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,172
我确实撞了你 而你受伤了
and I did run you over and you're hurt...

351
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,652
我想你可以留下来
I guess you can stay.

352
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,296
谢谢你  我在哪儿都可以睡 真的
Thanks, mate. And I could bunk down anywhere. 
Seriously.

353
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:42,134
西边是主人套房
宾客室 我不挑剔的
West wing, master suite,
guest bedroom. I'm not picky.

354
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,298
好吧 这地方是干什么用的
Right. Okay. What's this space, then?

355
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,009
这是你今晚要呆的地方
This is a place for you to stay for the night.

356
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,338
我又不是汽车 为什么我要住这儿
I'm not a car.
So why would I need to stay here?

357
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,371
听着 这不是我的房子
Look, it's not my house.

358
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,020
我甚至不允许上楼 而且我是人类
I'm not even allowed to go upstairs, and I'm human.

359
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,811
不好意思 这些报纸是干什么的
Sorry. What are the newspapers for?

360
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,414
因为我真的不是一个喜欢阅读的兔子
Because I'm not really a voracious reader or anything.

361
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,050
你知道的 你是动物
所以 我们都知道动物....
You know, you're an animal.
So, we all know animals...

362
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,415
我理解   我会就睡在这儿
I understand. I'll just sleep down here,

363
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,730
像猪一样睡在大小便之间
among my poo and pee like a pig.

364
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,014
如果你喜欢 你也可以
If you like, you use it as well.

365
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,889
对不起
Sorry.

366
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,099
不 不要因为这些责备你自己
No, don't reproach yourself
for these medieval conditions.

367
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,333
耶  随便吧
Yeah, whatever.

368
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,413
我要睡觉了
我真希望是一个人
I'm going to go to bed
where, hopefully, I've been all along.

369
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,219
晚安
So, good night.

370
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,858
噢  好吧  我就一个人
Oh, okay, I'll just stay here then.

371
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,539
留在这儿
By myself.

372
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,779
在黑暗中
In the dark.

373
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,340
房门紧锁
With the door closed.

374
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,055


375
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,536
先生  我有消息
Señor. Señor, I have news.

376
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,295
各项作业都在全速工作
Operations are running at full capacity.

377
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:05,129
在我的监督之下 
我们直指复活节
With my supervision,
we are right on target for Easter.

378
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,860
好 好  有什么关于我儿子的报道吗
Fine, fine. But is there any report on my son?

379
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,373
是的 我有报告
Yes, I have the report.

380
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,770
阳光(sun)照耀的日子就快来了
大雾天气即将过去
The sun will be shining,
foggy times are lifting.

381
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,534
复活节将会非常适合出航 先生
Easter will be clear sailing, señor.

382
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,129
不是说太阳(sun)  是我的儿子(son) E.B.
Not the sun. My son, E.B.!

383
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,298
那个儿子 是的 我差点忘了
That son. Yes. I almost forget.

384
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,600
今晚早些时候 
The rabbit hole was used

385
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,969
气动跑兔管被一个非计划当中的旅行使用了 先生
for an unscheduled trip earlier this evening, sir!

386
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,212
什么 你意思是他逃跑了
What? You mean he ran away?

387
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,220
在我们最繁忙的时候
And at the height of our busiest time.

388
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,133
这是不可饶恕的
It's almost unforgivable.

389
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,335
但是他怎么就这样走了  这不像他啊
But how could he just take off like this? It's just not like him.

390
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,574
先生 请别着急
Please, señor. Don't be too rash.

391
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,890
和他断绝关系还为时过早
It's way too early to disown him.

392
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,653
但是我并没有要...
等等 你希望这样吗?
But I wasn't going to...
Wait a minute. Are you hopping?

393
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,174
有吗  我没注意
Am I? I didn't notice.

394
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,735
这只是顺其自然的事情
It just comes so naturally.

395
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,809


396
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,492
不管怎样  先生  
考虑到你已经为这个分心了
Anyway, señor, considering
your obvious distraction with this,

397
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,132
把这个任务交给
wouldn't it be wise to pass the mantle to,

398
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,932
我不知道 比如其他人选 会不会明智点
I don't know, somebody else?

399
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,175
嗯..
Hmm.

400
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,336
我想想
一定要是你想相信的人
Let's see.
It would have to be someone you trust.

401
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,338
适合发号施令的人
Someone who is comfortable giving orders.

402
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,530
Phil 继续工作 但是更快些
Phil! Keep doing that, but do it faster!

403
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,059
更快    知道了
Faster. Gotcha.

404
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:17,013
-禁止舞蹈
-不舞蹈 知道了 先生
-CARLOS: And stop dancing!
-No dancing. Yes, sir.

405
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,937
Carlos 你是对的
Carlos, you're right.

406
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,694
我是完全对的
I'm totally right.

407
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,492
把粉色的贝雷帽都召集起来
Assemble the Pink Berets at once!

408
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,089
抱歉  什么
I'm sorry. What?

409
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,619
我们要找到E.B.
We need to find E.B.

410
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,292
粉红色的贝雷帽
The Pink Berets?

411
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,373
但是他们只能在非常紧急的情况才能使用
But they're only to be used
in a situation of extreme emergency.

412
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,453
Carlos 现在就是非常紧急的时刻
粉红色的贝雷帽会找到E.B.的
This is pretty extreme, Carlos.
The Pink Berets will find E.B.

413
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,055
他们必须(找到E.B.)
They have to!

414
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,496
你不能永远忽视我的存在
先生 或者兔子
You can't ignore me forever,
Señor Bunny.

415
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,209

416
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,289


417
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,055


418
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,249


419
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,535


420
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,894
别动
Freeze!

421
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,931


422
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,774


423
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,690


424
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,125
HEFNER：谁在那儿  还是你吗(指E.B.)
HEFNER: Who's there? Is this the same guy?

425
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,609
别逼我下来
Don't make me come down there.

426
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,775


427
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,019
收音机: 101大厦由于Burbank入口处推翻的牵引车
MAN ON RADIO: 101 is blocked due to an overturned tractor trailer

428
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,573
而封闭
at the Burbank entrance.

429
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,696
气温是凉爽的72°
Weather is a cool 72 degrees...

430
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,293


431
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,295
兔子
Rabbit.

432
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,129
喂
Hello?

433
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,973
会说话的兔子?
Talking rabbit?

434
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,368


435
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,653
好吧 哇
Okay. Wow.

436
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,497
老兄 你压力太大了
Dude, you are stressed.

437
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,972
嗨  Fred O'Hare
Hi, Fred O'Hare.

438
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,016
嘿 Fred O'Hare 很高兴见到你
Hey, Fred O'Hare. Nice to meet you.

439
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,452
我是Fred O'Hare  你这个工作需要我
I'm Fred O'Hare.
You need me for this job.

440
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,452
你会雇用我的
You're going to hire me for this job.

441
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,178


442
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,850
噢  这些狗 对了
Oh! The dogs. Right.

443
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,015
"Sam 直到Daisy和Baby跟你混熟了之前"
"Sam, until Daisy and Baby are accustomed to you,

444
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:53,217
"你喂他们的时候 都必须要穿上壁橱里面的那套安全服"
"please wear the safety suit
in the hall closet when you feed them."

445
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,735
安全服
Safety suit?

446
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,654
Daisy! Baby! 到这儿来
Daisy! Baby! Come here.

447
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,809

448
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,339
快点  我可是按照时间表来的
Let's go. I'm on a schedule here.

449
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,133


450
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,855
噢
Oh!

451
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,735


452
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,738


453
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,529
不要啊
No!

454
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,377
不要啊  坐下 坐下
No! Heel! Sit! Sit!

455
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,255


456
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,893
这就对了
That's fine.

457
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,772
好的 一切都很好
Okay, it's all good.

458
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,371


459
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,213
噢  不  不
No, no, no!

460
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,889


461
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,258
看 Fred     你能相信吗
Look, Fred! Can you believe it?

462
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,058
他们这儿有套鼓
They've got a drum kit in here.

463
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,249
你感觉怎么样
What do you think?
Never had one formal lesson!

464
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:15,450
我就是超级摇滚大师
I am the Extreme Rock Master!

465
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,178
我知道你想什么
I know what you're thinking.

466
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,295
-不 你其实不知道
-No, you really don't.

467
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,172
嘿 怎么了 
你看起来有点走神
Hey, Fred, what's wrong?
You look a bit put out.

468
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,569
为什么你还在这儿
Why are you still here?

469
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,174
你不能在这儿 这是房子的禁区
You can't be up here. You're in the forbidden part of the house.

470
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,534
耶  但你不是也在这儿
Yeah, but so are you.

471
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,373
把这些捡起来 你简直摧毁了这个地方
Pick this up, man.
You've destroyed the place!

472
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,974
我不会说"摧毁." 我只不过变得更舒服了
I wouldn't say, "destroyed."
I was just getting comfortable.

473
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,331
你伤口怎么样了
哈  你的腿 你受伤了 对吧
What about your injury?
Huh? Your leg? You're hurt, right?

474
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,930
没错  完全正确 我需要一张柔软的床来静养
Yeah, exactly. I needed a soft bed in which to convalesce.

475
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,170
哦  我知道了 所以你爬上楼梯来...
Oh, I see. So, you climbed a flight of stairs...

476
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,133
挣扎着爬上每一步阶梯还是值得的
Struggled up each stair is more like it. Worth it, though.

477
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,139
那个按摩浴缸让我全身放松
That Jacuzzi loosened me right up.

478
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,688
按摩浴缸?
Jacuzzi?

479
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,338


480
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,337
E.B.:哦 耶  也许你想关掉它
E.B.: Oh, yeah. You might want to turn it off.

481
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,939
我正在制造很多气泡
It was creating a lot of bubbles.

482
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,328
不
No!

483
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,175


484
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,818
我妹妹一定会杀了我的
My sister is going to kill me!

485
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,255
别担心  一旦我得了高分
Don't worry. We'll clean it up together,

486
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,296
我们会清理干净的
as soon as I've beat my high score.

487
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,649
嘿 Fred  该你了
拿起吉他 老兄
Hey, Fred! Come on, your turn.
Pick up a guitar, mate.

488
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,410
E.B.: Fred 我想我们走错路了
E.B.: Fred, I think we got off on the wrong foot.

489
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,775
你说了一些话 我淹没了一些东西
You said some things,
I flooded some things.

490
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,336
让我们重新来过
Let's start over again.

491
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,170
Fred  为什么我在盒子里
Fred? Why am I in a box?

492
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,975
这看起来像是杀手会干的事情
This seems like the sort of thing a serial killer might do.

493
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,689
这是个惊喜吗
Is this going to be a surprise?

494
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,731
好了 出来吧
All right, come on. Out.

495
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,738
噢  我们要远足旅行吗
Oh! Are we going for a hike?

496
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,579
比那更好  我们要将你放生回大自然
Better! We're releasing you into the wild.

497
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,928
荒野?
The wild?

498
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,055

499
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,175

500
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,499


501
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,013
哦  不 不 不     我只想跟你在一起
Oh, no, no, no. I'll just stay with you, I think.

502
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,535
这地方看起来食肉动物是老大
This place seems to be dominated by carnivores.

503
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,419
-出来 我们走吧
-你在干什么
-Get out. Let's go.
-What are you doing?

504
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,299
你要把我留在这儿
You're going to leave me here?

505
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,575
耶  那有很多兔子 
你会感觉就像家一样亲切
Yeah, there's lots of rabbits out here.
You'll feel right at home.

506
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,055
E.B.: Fred 我们处在破坏性的关系中?
E.B.: Fred, are we locked in a destructive relationship?

507
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,250
-FRED:出来
-FRED: Get out.
-Fred. You're making a scene!

508
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,529
出去
Get out!

509
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,733
继续走啊
Move along.

510
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,891
Fred. 看
Look, Fred. 

511
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,895
-再见
-但是我想和你在一起
-Goodbye!
-But I want to stay with you!

512
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,379
-Fred 请不要走
-我已经迟到了 赶快走开吧
-Fred, please don't go.
-I'm already late. So go away.

513
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,539
别这样嘛  老兄
Come on, man.

514
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,859
Fred 我会乖乖的
Fred, mate. I'll behave.

515
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,249
我会负责清洁工作 我会洗餐具
I'll clean up my mess. I'll do the dishes.

516
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,052
不是你的问题 大自然没有餐具
Not your problem. There are no dishes in the wild.

517
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:44,255
不要 Fred 但是我很特别的
No. Fred. But I'm special.

518
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,411
嗯 我们都是很特别的
Well, we're all special.

519
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,771
你没听懂
You're not getting it.

520
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,255
我不是说"每个人的特别之处"
I don't mean special as in,
"everybody's special."

521
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,735
我的意思是 我是真的很特别
I mean, I'm really special.

522
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,615


523
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,294
你在干什么
What're you doing?

524
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,135
看见了没
See?

525
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,334
FRED: 果子凍
FRED: Jelly beans?

526
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,455
嗯 嗯
Mmm-hmm.

527
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,053
那又怎么样? 你可以走路 还能拉出糖果
So what? So you talk and you poop candy.

528
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,209
你可以去打扰别人的生活吗
Could you do it in someone else's life?

529
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,291
是 你是对的  你一点也不关心
No, you're right. It's not your concern.

530
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:16,214
再过2个星期 也许你可以向全世界的孩子解释
And in two weeks, maybe you can explain
to the children of the world

531
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,098
为什么他们没收到复活节礼篮
why they didn't get their Easter baskets.

532
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,048
复活节
Easter?

533
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,493
什么 复活节
What, Easter?

534
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,449
不可能
No way.

535
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:43,495
是的 我就是复活节兔
Yes, Fred. I am the Easter Bunny.

536
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,289

537
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,969
进来
Hop in.

538
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,011
是的 我就知道 我就知道
我就知道你是真的 我就知道
Yes! I knew it! I knew it.
I knew you were real. I knew it!

539
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,778
你在说什么  我当然是真实的
What are you talking about? Of course I'm real.

540
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,929
不是
No.

541
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,693
我还是个孩子的时候，在复活节早晨看到过你
When I was a kid,I saw you on Easter morning.

542
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,614
-你真的见过
-耶
-You did?
-Yeah.

543
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,658
那就是你 对吧
That was you, right?

544
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,018
绝对地   毫无疑问
Absolutely. No question.

545

He didn't get that children sometimes just want to drum.

551
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,016

Right.

555
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,735

所以... 等等  为什么你会在这儿
So... Wait a minute. Why are you here now?

Just doing a little last minute recon
for Easter deliveries.

and I don't think anyone there is going to be able to handle you.

570
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,538
我不确信我能应付你
所以 帮我个忙 就在车里等吧
I'm not sure I can handle you.
So, just do me a favor? Wait in the car.

571
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,415

It's about a crippled soldier who,
in the future, goes to another planet

623
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,054

630
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,130
但是你可以从收发室开始
But you'd be starting in the mailroom.

You're right. I'll create a diversion

651
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,771
然后我们趁机逃走
and we'll escape in the ensuing chaos.

652
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,969

出去   我要杀了你  快出去
Quit it! I'm going to kill you so bad! Get out!

680
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,971
好的 Fred 我们继续...
Okay, Fred, let's try and keep moving...

681
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,893
-我突然感觉不太好
-噢
-I'm all of a sudden not feeling so good.
-Oh.

682
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,857
-有休息室吗
-有的
-Do you have a restroom?
-Yeah.

683
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,009
在哪儿
Where is that?

684
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,059
太棒了
That was brilliant!

685
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,449
我意思是 很紧凑
I mean, that was tight.

686
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,297
听起来不错 但是我能听出他的声音
Sounded all right.
But I know my drummer when I hear him.

687
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,413
所以 你是谁 小男孩?
So, who are you, boy?

688
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,936
好吧 我承认 我不是那个负责蓝调的家伙 我是E.B.
Okay, I admit it. I'm not a blues man.
My name is E.B.

689
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,732
我只不过是街街上拿着2根木棒
I'm just some guy off the street

690
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,618
怀揣梦想的一个路人
with two sticks of wood and a dream.

691
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,054
如果你们赶我出去也能理解
I understand if you throw me out.

692
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,619
如果你不想打断我
I get it if you don't want to give me a break.

693
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,298
嘿 别急 朋友
Hey, slow down, friend.

694
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:43,493
我们有个伙伴是专门寻找新的天才的
You know, we have a buddy who is always
on the lookout for new talent.

695
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:47,977
而且这个人是个天才
他简直是娱乐教父
And the man is a genius.
He is the godfather of entertainment.

696
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,619
And he's having auditions tomorrow.

697
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:53,091
Hoff?     你意思是他能帮我
The Hoff? You mean he can help me?

698
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,408
如果他喜欢你的话
If he like you.

699
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,968
哇 谢谢 
Wow. Thanks, Blind Boys.

700
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,858
祝你好运 小兔子
Good luck, little rabbit.

701
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,254
等等 你怎么知道我是....
Wait, how did you know I was...

702
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,615
嗯
Mmm!

703
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,253
你们太聪明了
Clever gents.

704
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,257
E.B.: Fred 面试怎么样
E.B.: So, Fred, how'd it go?

705
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,978
FRED: 什么也别说了
FRED: Don't say a word.

706
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,529

707
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,018
FRED: 我能澄清一下吗
FRED: Can I get a little clarification, here?

708
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,619
这就是复活节兔现在要做的事情?
Is this what the Easter Bunny does now?

709
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,816
他只是不断串门 搞砸别人的生活?
He just goes house to house, messing up people's lives?

710
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,498
呃  这很伤人
Well, that is just hurtful.

711
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,815
此外 你在推销自己的缺点
Besides, you're selling yourself short.

712
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,135
在收发室 他们会排挤你的
They were going to shove you in the mail room.

713
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,370
嗯  但是我认为你很优秀
Well, excuse me, but I happen to think
you're better than that.

714
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,695
你不了解我 好吧 我们只不过刚见面
You don't know me, okay? We just met.

715
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:39,893
我能说的是  你有很大的潜力
I can tell. You give off this aura of untapped potential.

716
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:41,975
真的吗?
I do?

717
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,179
别糊弄我 兔子 我比你聪明多了
Don't pull that with me, rabbit, okay?
I'm too smart for you.

718
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,938
但是 Fred 我是认真的
But, Fred, I'm serious.

719
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,693
你注定要做些伟大的事情 我知道
You're destined to do something great . I just know it.

720
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,055
我以前听过
I've heard that one before.

721
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,216
你会找到一个好工作的
You'll find an awesome job.

722
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,535
嘿 看 这个怎么样
Hey. Look, what about this?

723
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,293
-遛狗的?
-不好
-Dog walker?
-No.

724
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,019
-TSA 办公人员
-不要
-TSA Officer?
-No.

725
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,610
这个怎么样 看起来很刺激
What about this one? It looks exciting.

726
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,498
"Wind in your hair, hot babe on your arm."
Wind in your hair, hot babe on your arm.

727
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,339
那个是汽车广告
That's a car ad.

728
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,849
那你应该买那车
You should buy that car, then.

729
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,049


730
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,735


731
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,373
啊 先生  你好吗 jefe?
Ah! Señor. How you doing, jefe?

732
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,693
我打扰你了么
Am I disturbing?

733
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,528
这里从没有如此安静过
It's never been this quiet in here.

734
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,299
耶 太沉闷了
Yeah, it's so depressing.

735
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:30,417
你应该清理干净
弄一个新的巢穴或者会所
You should clear this out.
Make a new den or a clubhouse.

736
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,213
就像人类居住的一样 一定很有趣
Like a man-cave! It'll be fun.

737
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:36,214
我觉得他的梦想是荒谬的
I called his dreams ridiculous.

738
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,579
哪种父亲会那么做
What kind of father does that?

739
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,928
没有 先生
No, no, señor.

740
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,620
我不允许您因为这个而责备自己
I will not permit you to beat yourself up over this.

741
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,732
有像您一样的父亲的人是非常幸运的
Anybody would be lucky
to have a father such as you.

742
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,095
谢谢你 Carlos 我想他了
Thank you, Carlos. I miss him.

743
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,613
我也是
Me, too, señor.

744
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,379
儿子是很难替代的
A son is very difficult to replace.

745
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:56,731
很难替代  但也不是不可能
Difficult, but not impossible.

746
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,134
Carlos...
Carlos...

747
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,291
这是....  你头上是什么东西
What the... What's that on your head?

748
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,571
什么 我的新耳罩么
What? My new earmuffs?

749
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,932
今年春天很冷 你知道吗 先生
It's a cold spring this year, you know? Brr!

750
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,815
哦
Oh.

751
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,931
不管如何 我应该做什么
Anyway, what am I going to do?

752
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,778
我知道  您如此孱弱的肩膀
I know, how can you deliver Easter

753
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,892
怎能担任运送彩蛋这个艰巨的任务
with this tremendous burden
on your old, frail shoulders?

754
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,971
嘿   嘿   嘿   注意措辞
Hey, hey, hey, easy with the "old."

755
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,091
我只是说说而已 比如和我相比的话
No, I'm just saying, like, compared to me.

756
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,899
你不会是想自己走这趟旅途吧
Surely you're not thinking of making the trip yourself?

757
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,015
我们有选择吗
What choice do we have?

758
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,136
我们可以凑合凑合 我意思是
We can improvise. I mean...

759
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:31,409
-它甚至必须要一只兔子才行吗
-什么
-Does it even have to be a bunny?
-What?

760
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,651
我是想 鉴于这些烦恼的时期
I suppose, given these troubled times,

761
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:38,416
一只不起眼的鸡也能胜任这个工作
even a humble chick could do the job.

762
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,935


763
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,769
说真的 Carlos
Really, Carlos.

764
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,573


765
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,129
喔 我意思是 那很搞笑
Wow. I mean, that is funny.

766
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,450
你能想象吗  一只鸡来运送彩蛋
Can you imagine that? A chick delivering Easter?

767
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:50,814
这太荒谬了
That's ridiculous.

768
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,373
哦 哎呀
Oh, dear me.

769
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,894
但是 我很感激你想让我高兴起来
But I appreciate you trying to cheer me up, though.

770
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,938
能逗你高兴是我的荣幸 先生
Please. It is my pleasure to amuse you, señor.

771
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,090
一只鸡运送....
A chick delivering...

772
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,815
Fred 我在想如果....
Fred, I was wondering if...

773
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,692
你明天有什么事吗
Are you doing anything tomorrow?

774
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,854
明天我要开始视频游戏公司的新工作了
Tomorrow I get to start my new job at the video game company.

775
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,655
等等  没有 他们没有要我
Wait a second. No, that didn't work out.

776
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,816
我知道 我知道 我很抱歉
I know. I know. I'm sorry about that.

777
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:25,330
但是 你知道吗  所谓守得云开见月明
But do you know what?
Every cloud has a silver lining.

778
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:28,850
要抓住这一线生机 Fred
And behold this silver lining, Fred!

779
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,095
Hoff先生?
The Hoff?

780
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:34,898
是的 我只是需要一个依靠
Yes, please. I just need a ride.

781
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:36,009
嗯
Mmm.

782
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,738
-不
-别这样嘛 Fred
-No.
-Come on, Fred.

783
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,852
这是我的大机遇 我愿意做任何事
This is my one big chance.
I'll do anything.

784
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,531
甚至远离你的生活
Even get out of your life.

785
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:50,850
我会带你去Hoff Knows Talent  然后我们到此为止
I take you to Hoff Knows Talent,
and that's it, we're done.

786
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,732
我很荣幸
Bunny's honor. 

787
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:53,895
给你
Right here, mate.

788
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,772
算了 口头协议就可以换了
It's okay. A verbal agreement is fine.

789
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,771
现在你意识到了 你不能说话
Now, you realize, you can't talk.

790
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,373
不 我可以
No. I can.

791
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,575
不行 我是说 你不应该讲话
No, what I mean is, you shouldn't talk.

792
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,258
什么 比如 永远
What? Like, ever?

793
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,574
耶 "永远"是最好不过的了
Yeah, "ever" would be wonderful.

794
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,691
但是从今以后  尤其是在其他人面前(不能讲话)
But from now on, especially not in front of other people.

795
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,931
他们会吓一跳 而且会解剖你的脑袋的
They might freak out and want to dissect your brain.

796
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,937
解剖? 这有点极端
Dissect? That's a bit extreme.

797
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,096
我可以轻松解释我为什么能讲话
There's an easy explanation
as to why I can talk.

798
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,017
只不过是可爱和魔法的结合罢了
It's a simple combination of cuteness and magic.

799
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,489
好的 您要的培根 生菜 番茄三明治
Okay. Here we go. One BLT.

800
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:22,499
还有一份胡萝卜 
And one order of carrot cake a la mode, topped with, quote,

801
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:25,572
Whatever candy you have laying around back there. Unquote.

802
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,093
呃 不好意思
Uh, excuse me.

803
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:29,254
Is that a cough drop?

804
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,571
耶  是樱桃口味的
Yeah. It's cherry. It counts.

805
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,617
奇怪的装饰
It's a peculiar garnish.

806
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,458
我能喝点巧克力糖浆吗
Can I get some chocolate syrup?

807
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,859
当然
Sure, doll.

808
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,893
E.B.: 谢谢 亲爱的
E.B.: Thanks, love.

809
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,738
Fred 貌似我的脑袋还是完整无缺的 
It seems my brain is still intact, Fred.

810
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,971
Fred 我想到个注意
E.B.: Fred, I've just had an idea.

811
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:52,490
等我成为著名的摇滚明星后  我要买一栋这样的豪宅
When I'm a famous rock star, I'm
going to buy a mansion just like this

812
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:55,936
and make you sleep in the garage in a topsy-turvy switcheroo.

813
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,773
-你在想什么
-哦 不好  我妹妹来了
-What do you think?
-Oh, man. My sister is here.

814
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,259
你从没告诉过我你有一个妹妹
You never told me you had a sister.

815
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,054
Fred  看来还有许多我们相互不知道的事情
There's still so much we don't know
about each other, Fred.

816
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,732
如果她上楼 我就死定了
If she goes upstairs, I'm dead.

817
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,094
-为什么
-为什么
-Why?
-Why?

818
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,249
想象今天早上
Let me take you back to this morning

819
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,092
你冲掉了卧室 你废掉了卧室
when you flooded the bathroom and you trashed the bedroom.

820
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,215
你还记得那个吗
You remember that?

821
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,337
Fred 这个交给我 我来搞定 哇
Fred, leave this to me.
I'll smooth it out with her. Ow!

822
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,451
-嘿
-看着我
-Hey!
-Look at me.

823
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,455
你要是敢说一句话的话 你懂的?
One word out of you,
and it's rabbit season. You got it?

824
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:22,452
好吧 我要去干扰下她
Okay, I'm going to run interference.

825
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,371
我要你潜入楼上去清理干净 
I need you to sneak upstairs and clean up, quietly!

826
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:28,855

827
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,289
-Sam
-嗨
-Sam!
-Hi!

828
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:33,372
嘿 真不是时候 我正要离开
Hey, it's not a good time
for me right now. I was just leaving.

829
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,813
但是你刚到这儿
But you just got here.

830
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:36,973
我知道 
I know, right?

831
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:40,017
-嘿 这些是什么
-噢
-Hey, what are these?
-Oh!

832
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:43,133
给我  嗯
There you are.  Mmm!

833
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,251
我正在调整饮食  只吃胡萝卜
I'm on this North Beach diet. It's carrots only.

834
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,978
所以房间里到处都是(胡萝卜)
That is why they're all over the house.

835
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,812
我正要打算去清理他们
I was going to clean them up, though.

836
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,654
-好 Fred 面试进行的如何
-什么
-Okay, Fred, how did the interview go?
-Yes?

837
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:54,208
噢  谢谢询问 棒极了 
Oh! Thank you for asking.
Amazing! I aced it.

838
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,375
-真的吗
-耶
-Really?
-Yeah.

839
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,535
不可能吧
No way!

840
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:57,979
你为什么这样吃惊
Why are you so surprised?

841
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,016
-Fred 那太棒了
-Place本来会用我的
-Fred, that's awesome!
-Place could use me, too.

842
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,978
很好 真的很棒
Don't get me wrong, it was great. It was good.

843
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,535
一切正常
It was all right.

844
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:07,970
我只是...不知道它是否适合我
I just... I don't know if it was for me, really. It just didn't gel.

845
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:10,699
整件事情感觉有点怪怪的
Something felt a little off about the whole thing.

846
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,179
我不明白
I didn't get it.

847
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,576
噢  什么 发生什么事了
Oh! What? What happened?

848
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:18,255
很难指出是哪个特定的事情
It's kind of hard to pinpoint any one specific thing.

849
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,212
哦  Fred
Oh, Fred.

850
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,808
我知道 我知道 抱歉
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

851
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,179


852
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:27,889
那是什么
What is that?

853
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:31,133
我不知道 因为我不允许上楼
I wouldn't know
because I'm not allowed to go up there.

854
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,609
而且 我从没到过那儿
And I haven't been up there once.

855
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,817
嗯 好吧
Hmm. Okay.

856
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:40,570
Sam 不要   你也不允许上去 别上去
Sam, no, you're not allowed up there, either. 
Don't go up there!

857
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,618
Sam 我求你了
Sam, I'm begging you!

858
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,732
我能解释
I can explain.

859
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:50,299
哦 天哪 看这个
-Oh, my God! Look at this.

860
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:59,892


861
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:04,410
这小兔子太可爱了
Look how cute this stuffed bunny is!

862
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,692
哇   耶    噢
Wow! Yeah. Oh.

863
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:09,653
-太可爱了
-是不是
-So cute!
-Isn't he?

864
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,537
耶 你知道吗 
也许我们不应该和他玩耍
Yeah, you know what?
Maybe we shouldn't be playing with him

865
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:14,180
因为我们是不允许上楼来的  所以...
because we're not really supposed
to be up here in the first place. So...

866
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:16,057
他看起来太生动了
He's just so lifelike.

867
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,493
你这样认为
You think?

868
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:18,979
我觉得他有点怪吓人的
It's a little freaky-looking to me.

869
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:24,417
噢 噢  他太柔软了
-Oh! Oh, he's so soft!


870
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,419
很萌  很可爱
And cute, and cuddly,

871
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,296
还很温暖
and warm.

872
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:32,768
好吧
Okay!

873
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:35,249
我想在事情变得更糟前还是把他放回去比较合适
Why don't we put him back
before things get uncomfortable?

874
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,898
不 我没有不舒服
No, I'm not uncomfortable.

875
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,096
嗯 因为我在照看这栋房子 我很不舒服
Well, I'm uncomfortable because I'm looking after the house

876
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:41,017
而这是我的责任
and it's my responsibility.

877
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,653
放这儿了
There we are.

878
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:46,139
-好了
-All right.


879
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,819
哦 天哪
Oh, my God!

880
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,938
哇 看这个 它就是个上了发条的玩具
Wow! Look at that. He's a wind-up toy.

881
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,136
真是太可爱了
That is so adorable!

882
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,211
耶  我想他可能是弄坏了
Yeah, I think he might be broken.

883
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,860
耶 你是个被弄坏的小家伙 是不是
Yeah, you're a broken little guy, aren't you?

884
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:08,575
嘿... 哦
Hey... Ow!

885
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,009


886
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,813
Fred  我真的很担心你
Fred, I am really worried about you.

887
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,375
嗯
Hmm!

888
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,053
别吃那个
Don't eat that.

889
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,371
你应该不会喜欢那个味道
You might not like the flavor.

890
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,099
Fred 放松点
Fred, relax.

891
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,415
西瓜味的
Watermelon.

892
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:28,775
我们可以走了吗
Can we go?

893
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:32,297
听着 Sam 我不想让你担心  好吧 
我会找到工作的
Look, Sam, I don't want you to worry,
okay? I'll get something.

894
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:35,053
听着 Fred 我只是想如果你告诉老爸老妈你有了工作的话
Look, Fred, I just thought it would make
tomorrow night a lot easier

895
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,529
明晚你会好过点
if you could tell Mom and Dad that you had a job.

896
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:39,656
哇    明晚什么事情
Whoa! What's tomorrow night?

897

talking about for weeks.

898
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,539

No, she's single,
and she's looking for a rabbit.

907
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,769


908
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,658
哇 Fred 这儿好多人啊

909
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,211
比我想象的要多
Way more than I imagined.

910
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:28,375
你紧张吗
You nervous?

911
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,133

00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,139
Fred 我感觉有点不舒服
I'm starting to feel a bit sick, Fred.

914
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:37,292
我从没在任何人面前表演过
I've never actually played in front of anybody.

915
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,211
加油 这个将是你千载难逢的机会
Come on. This could be your big opportunity.

916
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,530

I know it's my big chance,
but what if I blow it?

917
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,372
放松点 我会给你一个精彩的介绍
Relax. I'll give you a good intro.

918
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,297

What you're about to see will mystify you.

我给过他机会
I gave him a chance.

955
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,972
我不喜欢它
I didn't like it.

956
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:11,333

00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:13,851
喔 哦 哦

Hoff了解天才 而那只兔子很有天赋

You're not surprised that I'm a talking rabbit.

964

Little man, my best friend's a talking car.

I mean, he is a good actor,
but I think he was sincere.

971
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,289
谢谢你  别以为我已经忘了我们的约定
Thanks, mate. And don't think I've forgotten our deal.

972
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,138
你已经完成了你的部分
You've done your part.

973
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:57,728
现在 我准备远离你的生活
And now I'm ready to get out of your life.

974
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:02,093
很好 耶  很好
Good. Yeah, good.

975
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:06,572
我们有过快乐的时光 嗯 对吧  Fred
We've had some good times, eh? Haven't we, Fred?

976
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:09,416
是的 我们曾有过
Yeah, there were a few.

977
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,249
你验证了我所有童年时的梦
You validated my whole childhood dream.

978
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,171

让我想想     快乐的时光

980
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,134
呃 也许只是一段时光 但重点是
Well, maybe just one good time.
But the main thing is

981
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:24,332
I got to meet the guy on my second grade lunchbox.

982
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,458
Hasselhoff  哇
Hasselhoff, wow!

983
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,615
E.B.?
E.B.?

984
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,615
E.B.?

985
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,928
E.B.?
E.B.?

986
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,939
嘘 Fred

987
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,335
你在干什么

粉红色贝雷帽

990
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,651
-这儿没别人了
-哦  他在这儿
-There is nobody here.
-Oh yes, there is.

991
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,975
如果她们看见我了 他们会带我回复活节岛的
If they see me,they'll take me back to Easter Island

992
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:51,335
而我还没机会打过鼓
and I'll never get my chance to drum!

993
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:53,894
粉红色贝雷帽 哼 听起来很残忍的样子
Pink Berets? Huh? Sounds super fierce.

994
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,618
别被他可爱的名字耍了
Don't be fooled by their adorable name.

995
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,612
他们是复活节兔的皇家卫队
They're the Easter Bunny's Royal Guard!

996
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,020
但是 你是复活节兔 对吗
But you're the Easter Bunny! Aren't you?

997
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,017
技术上来讲  当然了 
Of course I am, technically.

998
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:07,129
"技术上"来讲是什么意思
What do you mean, "technically"?

999
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:09,290
我以后再解释 先上车
I'll explain later. Just get in the car.

1000
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:19,893
听着 我本来是要接管今年的复活节任务的 但是我逃跑了
Look, I was supposed to take over this year, but I ran away.

1001
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,412
你疯了吗?
What are you, crazy?

1002
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,854
不想成为复活节兔?
Who wouldn't want to be the Easter Bunny?

1003
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,254
那个 就像是最伟大的工作
That's, like, the greatest job ever!

1004
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:28,412
也 你这么认为
但是那只是我老爸的想法 不是我
Yeah, you'd think so.
But it's what my dad wants, not me.

1005
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:32,095
他期望太高了 除了让他失望我还能做什么
He expects so much. What's left for me to do but let him down?

1006
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,933
听起来很熟悉
Sounds familiar.

1007
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,656
有时候父母不理解
Sometimes fathers just don't get it.

1008
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:39,340
他告诉我 我只想到自己
He told me I only ever think of myself.

1009
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,411
其他时候 他们正中要害
Other times, they hit the nail right on the head.

1010
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,933
别这样 Fred 
Come on, Fred.

1011
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,011
我知道我们说过 你走你的阳关道 我过我的独木桥
I know we said we'd go our own separate ways,

1012
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,692
但是 请你一定要保护我
but please, you've got to protect me.

1013
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:47,849
听着 我很抱歉
Look, I'm sorry,

1014
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,771
但是我真的不能留你
but I can't really leave you places,

1015
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:51,817
我真的不能带你去这些地方
I can't really take you places.

1016
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,538
今晚我必须要去看我姐姐的演出

1022
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,895
我可以用桶
I could be one of those street drummers,

1023
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,698
成为街头鼓手之一
with a bucket!

1030
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:38,048

01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:48,931
-混蛋
-Jerk!

1090
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:53,493
哦  嘿 老爸  我正要离开
Oh! Hey, Dad. I was just leaving.

1091
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:57,533
Fred 今晚你真是让我们印象深刻
Fred, seems like we made quite
an impression on you the other night.

1092
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:58,769
这是你的新生涯吗
Is this your new career?

1093
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:01,328
用你的腹语玩偶登台表演?
Upstaging grade-schoolers with your ventriloquist puppet?

1094
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:04,258
哦 不是的 我还有很多其他事情要做
No, no, I got lots of other stuff going on.

1095
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,455
是吗
Yeah.

1096
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,173
-这就是了
-什么
-There it is.
-What?

1097
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,610
表情  这个彻底失望的表情
That look. The complete and utterly disappointed look.

1098
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:13,928
嗯 Fred 很抱歉 
Well, I'm sorry, Fred,

1099
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:16,853
但是 你能给我一个
but can you give me just, I don't know,

1100
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:20,459
我不会失望的理由吗
one reason not to be disappointed?

1101
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:21,734
这个...
Well...

1102
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:24,135
-一个就行
-耶
-Just one.
-Yeah.

1103
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,095
Fred?
Fred?

1104
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:36,855
Fred 你要去哪儿
Fred, where'd you go?

1105
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:38,732
我就在这儿
Yeah, I'm right here.

1106
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:43,735
我刚想起来我确实有个坚定的想法
I just remembered I have a really
great solid lead, actually.

1107
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,373
-真的?
-没错 一个伟大的工作
-You do?
-Yeah, a great job.

1108
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:46,893
-给我说说吧
-我真的不能跟你说
-Tell me about it.
-I can't really tell you about it.

1109
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:48,379
但是他很伟大 你一定会喜欢它的
But it's big. You're going to love it.

1110
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,778
它真的很伟大
It's really big!

1111
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:56,574
E.B.: Hey, what's with the "Mr. Serious" all of a sudden?

1112
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:58,776
等等 你是告诉我你想看看其他的兔子?
Wait, is this where you tell me
you want to see other rabbits?

1113
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:01,135
因为我很开明的  Fred
Because I'm open-minded, Fred.

1114
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:07,016
E.B. 我有个惊人的想法
E.B., I have the most amazing idea.

1115
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,013
当我还是孩子的时候 我告诉别人
When I was a kid, I told everyone

1116
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:11,579
我看见过复活节兔子 对吧
that I saw the Easter Bunny, right?

1117
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:13,173
但是 没人相信我
No one believed me,

1118
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:15,693
尽管如此
even though

1119
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:18,493
它留给我这个
he left me this.

1120
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:22,330
我一直留着的巧克力兔子
This chocolate bunny, which I kept.

1121
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:24,295
哦 天哪
Oh, dear.

1122
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,815
就在今晚 他撞到我了
And tonight, it just hit me.

1123
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,968
我觉得这是命运安排我见到它
I realized that it was my destiny to see him.

1124
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:34,700
就像命运安排我遇见你
Just like it was my destiny to meet you.

1125
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:36,778
它一定是引导我来这里
It's all been leading up to this.

1126
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:37,895
什么?
Up to what?

1127
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:40,091
你不想成为复活节兔 对吧
You don't want to be the Easter Bunny, right?

1128
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:41,699
我知道谁可以取代你的位置
I know who can take your place.

1129
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:42,849
谁
Who?

1130
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,855
就是我
Me!

1131
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:49,058
不好意思 你能再清楚的重复下吗
I'm sorry, Fred. Would you mind
repeating that in my good ear?

1132
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,335
我想成为复活节兔
I want to be the Easter Bunny.

1133
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:55,969
这是干什么
What was that for?

1134
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:57,971
这是给发疯了的人的
That is for people who have gone loony!

1135
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:00,051
一个人类复活节兔
A human Easter Bunny?

1136
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:02,330
 Fred 算了吧  这没有任何意义
Come on, Fred! It doesn't make sense.

1137
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:04,729
一只兔子才没意义 你运送彩蛋
A bunny makes no sense. You deliver eggs.

1138
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:07,091
如果你要逻辑 应该看看这个
If you wanna get all logical, bring logic into this,

1139
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:08,255
你应该是一只复活节小鸡
you should be an Easter Chicken.

1140
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:09,535
什么? 得了吧
What? Come on.

1141
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:12,612
人们刚开始可能坚持 
但是 改变可以是一件好事
People might resist it at first.
But, hey, change can be a good thing.

1142
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:15,538
总之你不想要这份工作 
You don't want the job anyway.
The pressure is ungodly!

1143
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:17,019
It did a number on me.

1144
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,977
你知道大概有9个月的时间
Do you know there was a period of roughly nine months

1145
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:21,290
让我看到彩蛋就像呕吐吗?
where the sight of a colored egg made me want to vomit?

1146
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:23,331
而兔子的身体结构是不能呕吐的
And rabbits are physically unable to vomit.

1147
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:26,378
所以只有....
So it was just hours of...

1148
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:27,609
但是什么也吐不出来
Nothing coming out.

1149
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:30,092
-我不关心
-想想吧 Fred.
-I don't care.
-Imagine that, Fred.

1150
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:31,249
我不关心
Don't care.

1151
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:33,535
如果你能成为鼓手
我可以成为复活节兔
If you can be a drummer,
I can be the Easter Bunny.

1152
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:36,418
Fred 总之你不能成为复活节兔
Fred, you can't just be the Easter Bunny.

1153
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:39,299
-我老爸必须要给你特别的力量
-呃
-My dad has to give you special powers.
-Eh.

1154
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:41,809
-此外 复活节兔身材还必须要合适
-噢
-Besides, the Easter Bunny has got to be fit. 
-Ow!

1155
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:43,658
而你太瘦了
And you're a little scrawny.

1156
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:45,338
最后 复活节兔必须要有
Finally, the Easter Bunny has got to have

1157
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:46,899
闪电般快速的反应  嗨-呀
lightning-fast reflexes. Hi-ya!

1158
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:50,256
少来了 我是认真的 我能做这个
Knock it off. I'm serious. I can do this.

1159
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:52,692
我会成为复活节兔
I will be the Bunny.

1160
01:04:56,340 --> 01:05:00,413
这个顽固的老兔子拒绝其他人来负责
The stubborn old bunny refuses to crown anyone else.

1161
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:03,617
这只能意味着一件事情 我的朋友
This can only mean one thing, my friends.

1162
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:07,171
我们必须要用自己的双手来争取
We are going to have to take matters into our own hands.

1163
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:09,654
-呃 呃  呃 Carlos? Carlos?
-Um, um, um. Carlos? Carlos?

1164
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:10,769
Phil 什么事
Yes, Phil?

1165
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:13,460
-先生  我们本身就没有手
-We don't have hands, per se.

1166
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:16,489
不是啦  这只是一个比喻  Phil
No, it's a figure of speech, Phil.

1167
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:17,609
哦 知道了
Right. Got it.

1168
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:20,937
我们已经在兔子暴政的枷锁下劳动很长一段时间了
Too long have we labored under the yoke of the bunnies' tyranny.

1169
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:22,658
嗯   不能再继续了
Well, no more!

1170
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:26,096
是复活节小鸡们崛起的时候了
It's time for the Easter Chick to rise!

1171
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:27,215


1172
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:29,609
-嗯 嗯
-Phil 又怎么了?
-Um, um...
-Yes, Phil?

1173
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:30,815
只是自言自语
Just thinking out loud.

1174
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:34,415
但是等E.B.回来不是更容易吗
我意思是 他能解决这个问题
But wouldn't it be easier just to
wait for E.B.? I mean, he can fix this.

1175
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,094
Phil 如果你这么喜欢E.B.
你怎么不嫁给他
Phil, if you love E.B. so much,
why don't you marry him?

1176
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:38,579
-E.B.走了 懂吗
-噢
-E.B. is gone, okay?
-Oh.

1177
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:40,013
会有个新老板
There is a new boss.

1178
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:42,250
真的吗 是谁 是我吗
Really? Who is it? Is it me?

1179
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:44,177
-你认真的吗
-Are you being serious?


1180
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:45,898
是的 嗨
Yes. Hi.

1181
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:48,653
只是为复活节歌唱排练
Just rehearsing for the big Easter sing-a-long.

1182
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:52,050
好的 各位
这次大家唱的更好点
Okay, everybody,
this time sing a lot more better.

1183
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:55,172
一   二   三   四
And one, and two. And three and four.

1184
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:57,490
是我 我 你个蠢货 我接管了
It's me. Me, you idiot. I'm taking over.

1185
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:58,899
哦  我明白了
Oh. I see.

1186
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:01,170
但是首先 我必须健身
But first, I must get in shape.

1187
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,218
我会成为复活节兔
I will be the Bunny.

1188
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:13,011
你知道吗 我一直在想 Fred
You know, I've been thinking, Fred.

1189
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:14,409
噢
Oh!

1190
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,693
嘿 E.B.  怎么了
Hey, E.B., what's up?

1191
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:21,009
Fred 听着 你帮助我成为了一个鼓手
Fred, listen. You helped me become a drummer.

1192
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:22,938
我如何报答你
And how do I repay you?

1193
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:26,899

I jellybean all over your dream. Well, no. No.

1194
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:29,534
我改变主意了
我看到了曙光
I've changed me mind.
I've seen the light.

1195
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,691
我们要这样做了
We're going to do this.

1196
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:33,812
事关彩蛋的精彩的工作
And nice job on the eggs.

1197
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:36,653
我告诉过你我是认真的
I told you I was serious.

1198
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:41,017
72
这些条件是必须的
Seventy-two.
Conditioning is a must, Fred.

1199
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:42,489
73
Seventy-three.

1200
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:46,290
这太有趣了 
This is fun. Just a couple of dudes hanging out, getting buff.

1201
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:47,654
我可以一整天这样做
I could do this all day!

1202
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:49,731
我也是  我感觉棒极了
Me, too, Fred. I feel great.

1203
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:51,415


1204
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:57,891
Phil 老实说 我做的怎么样
Phil, how am I doing? Be honest.

1205
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:00,417
E.B.: 下一项 速度和敏捷性 Fred
E.B.: Next up, speed and agility, Fred.

1206
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:03,651
I want you to run so fast that you're
just a handsome blur with great hair.

1207
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:05,059
准备好了吗 开始
Ready? Go!

1208
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,535


1209
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:13,219
Fred  这太棒了
Fred, that was awesome!

1210
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:15,655
只用了几秒钟 你就触摸到了伟大
For a couple of seconds,you touched greatness.

1211
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:19,528
我感觉在燃烧
I can feel the burn!

1212
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:21,451
但是很好 这很好
But it's good. It's a good burn.

1213
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:25,899
Phil 太快了 太快了
Phil, too fast! Too fast, Phil!

1214
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:28,209
(SCREAMING)

1215
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:29,415
抱歉 先生
Sorry, sir.

1216
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,177
加油 Fred! 继续跳
Come on, Fred! Keep hopping!

1217
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:35,091
喔  就是这种精神
Woohoo! That's the spirit!

1218
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:37,136
学生即将变成导师
The student is becoming the master.

1219
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,529
Padawan(学徒)即将变成Jedi(绝地武士)
(Padawan Jedi 都是《星球大战》里面的角色)
The Padawan is becoming the Jedi!

1220
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:43,693
人类即将成为复活节兔
The human being is becoming the Easter Bunny.

1221
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:47,330
我能感觉自己变得强壮了

It's The Hoff!

1364
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:54,809
Fred?
Fred?

1365
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:57,819
有人在家吗
Anybody home?

1366
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:00,329
Fred?
Fred?

1367
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:11,329
呃 哦
Uh-oh.

1368
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:18,536
复活节月亮升起来了
The Easter moon is on the rise.

1369
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:19,975
在午夜的时候
At midnight,

1370
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:24,975
她明亮的光束将会用魔力填满命运彩蛋
her radiant beams will fill up the Egg of Destiny with magic.

1371
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:28,058
然后 兔子先生
Then, at last, Señor Bunny,

1372
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:30,893
我将会是复活节新的国王
I will be Easter's new king!

1373
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,618
Carlos 我警告你
Carlos, I'm warning you!

1374
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:36,010
命运彩蛋在一只鸡手里太危险了
The Egg of Destiny is too dangerous in the hands of a chick.

1375
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:38,489
它强大的力量只有兔子才能执掌
Its power can only be wielded by a bunny.

1376
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:41,492
哦 真的吗  嗯 看看我握着 
我正握着呢
Oh, yes? Well, look at me wielding.
I'm wielding!

1377
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:43,969
哦 哦  我又握了 好吧
Ooh-ooh. I'm wielding it again. Okay?

1378
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:47,331
哦 Carlos 我能挥舞下命运彩蛋吗
Oh, Carlos, can I wield the Egg of Destiny? Please?

1379
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:48,455
不行
No.

1380
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:49,734
我能摸一下吗
Can I at least touch it?

1381
01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:51,738
-哦呜
-那儿 摸吧
-Ow!
-There, you touched it.

1382
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:52,969
那太严苛了
That was harsh.

1383
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:54,732
但是 Carlos 想想孩子们
But, Carlos, think of the children.

1384
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:56,651
是的 但是我是 孩子们
Yes, but I am! The childrens.

1385
01:17:56,740 --> 01:17:59,129
他们不想要糖果和巧克力
They don't want candy and chocolate.

1386
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:00,494
从今以后
From now on,

1387
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:04,971
他们的篮子将会装满鸟的种子和晒干的蟋蟀
their baskets will be filled with clumps
of bird seed, dried crickets,

1388
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:07,858
还有全世界最好的虫子
and the world's finest worms!

1389
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:11,251
哼  哼  哼
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

1390
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:12,814
嗯
Mmm!

1391
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:15,450
你疯了吗
Have you completely lost your mind?

1392
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:18,418
安静 你们看见没 这就是为什么他必须离开的原因
Silence! You see,this is why he must go.

1393
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:22,652
就是他这种态度  
It's this lousy attitude of his.
Well, no more!

1394
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:27,373
这里最敏感的小鸡们也许要避开他们的视线
The more sensitive chicks in the room
may want to avert their eyes.

1395
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:29,497
来个妥协怎么样?
What about a compromise, okay?

1396
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:32,333
兔子负责一年复活节 然后是小鸡
The bunny gets Easter one year
and the chick gets it the next.

1397
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:33,978
谈判结束
Enough of the chitty-chatty.

1398
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:36,779
拜拜     复活节兔
Bye-bye, Easter Bunny.

1399
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,413
嗨  嘿  各位
Hello! Hey, everyone.

1400
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:42,016
我回来了  是的 那是个大大的错误 但是我还活着
I'm back. Yep, it was all a big mistake, but I'm alive.

1401
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:44,614
嘿 Larry  Kyle 你们里面干嘛
Hey, Larry, Kyle,
what are you doing in there?

1402
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,895
E.B. 你还活着
E.B.! You're alive!

1403
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:48,208
E.B.
E.B.!

1404
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:51,298
老爸 Fred  发生什么事了
Dad? Fred? What's going on?

1405
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:55,012
焦糖大炮 就位  准备开火
Gummy cannons! In position. Fire at will!

1406
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:57,455


1407
01:18:58,340 --> 01:18:59,455
好疼
That hurt!

1408
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:01,098
把他放到带子上去 孩子们
Put him on the belt, boys.

1409
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:04,775
切了他 粉碎他
Dice him, slice him, and pulverize him!

1410
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:06,458
这太过分了
That is a bit excessive.

1411
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:09,655
-噢 不要 E.B.
-儿子
-Oh, no! E.B.!
-Son!

1412
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:12,419
兔子在位的时代结束了
The reign of the bunny is over!

1413
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:15,055
噢
Oh!

1414
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,655
救命啊  救救我们
Somebody help! Help us!

1415
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:21,529
你们干什么  别担心
老爸  Fred  我会很好的
What are you doing? Don't worry,
Dad, Fred. I'll be right there.

1416
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:24,171
去彩蛋雪橇上 
To the Egg Sleigh! And step on it!

1417
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:31,015


1418
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:33,412
这些绳子是黑甘草制作的吗
Are these ropes made of black liquorice?

1419
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:36,008
是 是的  可怕的东西
Yes, yes, they are. Horrible stuff!

1420
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:37,209
我们可以办到的
We can eat through them.

1421
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:39,530
我想你能
I suppose you can.

1422
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:50,375
看见没 朋友们  就如我告诉你们的那样
You see, my friends?
It is just like I told you, no?

1423
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:53,577
噢  今晚将是个重要的夜晚
Oh, tonight is going to be a very big night!

1424
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:57,455
我没有这些小翅膀
-I'm flying!

1425
01:19:57,540 --> 01:20:00,771
也能飞
Without even flapping my tiny wings.

1426
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:03,854
什么事情都让Carlos赶上了
Everything is coming up Carlos!

1427
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:05,095


1428
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:10,539
-可以了
-好样的 Fred
-Got it!
-Good man, Fred.

1429
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:13,175
跳上来
Hop on.

1430
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:14,574
好的 出发
All right. Let's go!

1431
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:18,859
我开始感觉自己面临死亡了
I'm starting to get a sense of impending doom now.

1432
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:21,173
噢

1433
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,089

1437
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:45,209


1438
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:50,975
我做到了
I made it!

-Fred  看 E.B.在那儿
-E.B.
-Look, Fred! There he is. It's E.B.!
-E.B.!

1442
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:01,735
彩蛋雪橇 你们要阻止Carlos
The Egg Sleigh! You've got to stop Carlos!

1443
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:03,378
别担心 老爸 我会的
Don't worry, Dad! I'm on it!

1444
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:08,415


1445
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:11,090
力量在我身体涌动
The power is surging through my veins!

1446
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:12,215


1447
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:14,818
当国王的感觉真好
It's good to be the king.

1448
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:15,969
呃?
Eh?

1449
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:17,095


1450
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:22,894
我怎么了
What is happening to me?

1451
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:24,375


1452

出来  Carlos 该结束了
Come on out, Carlos. It ends here!

1457
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:44,014
你认为你能接管复活节
You think you can just take over Easter?

1458
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:45,732
嗯 你猜怎么着
Well, guess what?

1459
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:48,779

1460
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:52,016
我在想你有事情要做
I actually think you're on to something.

1461

你是个聪明的人 你是个创新者
You're a bright man, you're an innovator.

I like it. Give it a whirl.

1463
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:58,533


1464
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:05,376

呃... 不尽然
Um... Not quite.

1467
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:09,895


1468
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:15,489


1469
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:17,695

1470

噢
Ow!

1476
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:38,769
你父亲愚蠢的认为你能做点事情
You father was a fool to think you would ever amount to anything.

1477
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:39,929


1478
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:42,410
