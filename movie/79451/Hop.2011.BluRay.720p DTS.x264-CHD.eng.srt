the many noble rabbits

who have served as the Easter Bunny.

If you've ever gotten a basket of candy

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,591
and colored eggs on Easter morning,

8
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,591
you have them to thank.

00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,518
Yes, even that guy.

10
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,077
See, every bunny dreams of holding
the title, but not just anyone can do it.

You have to be majestic.
You have to be dignified.

You have to be, well, a bunny.

Or, at least you did.

You are getting so big,
you're practically a foot tall.

162
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,978
ever since I was yea big, it's been,

163
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,176
"The Easter Bunny wouldn't do that" and

164
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,490
"The Easter Bunny has to be perfect."

165
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,808
But I'm not perfect.

166
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,414
I know that, Son.
But you'll get there, eventually.

167

168
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,809
Listen. You want me to be this.

169
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,170
But maybe I'm not this.

170
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,172
Just maybe, maybe I'm this.

171
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,813
A sock? (SNIFFS)

172
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,935
Ugh.

173
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,097
Yeah, that's right.
I might be a metaphorical sock.

174
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,337
I might not be a good enough egg,

175
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,297
but I might be the best sock ever.

176
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,208
I might not cut it
delivering Easter baskets,

177
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,609
but I might be great at something else.

00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,814
Oh, the drums! Why, I think that's fine.

179
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,698
I think it's really nice that you have
a hobby. Everyone should have a hobby.

180
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,771
It's not a hobby, Dad.

181
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,211
I want to drum in a band.
I want to see the world.

182
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,729
E.B., the Easter Bunny sees the world.

183
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,779
Every country in one night,
making people of the world happy.

184
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,409
Really, Dad? The whole world?

185
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,571

All right. So,
we haven't cracked China yet.

00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,896
But, for all those that do believe,
you will be there.

192
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,448
No, Dad. I don't want
to be the Easter Bunny.

Look. Dad...

197
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,415
No, E.B., you look!

198
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,650
You are going to be the Easter Bunny!

Now you need to get it together,
get rid of these drums,

that I am not
supposed to help you, okay?

220

-Entry-level?
-At a video game company!

-Okay. That's kind of cool.
-I know.

All right, look, if it means
that much to you, I'll swing by.

232
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,690
No, Fred. You don't "swing by." Okay?

Yeah. You know what? You're right.

a new place, a new life.

00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,009
My boss is on vacation for a few weeks
and he asked me to house-sit.

247
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,812
Nobody ever asks me to house-sit.

248
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,379
I know. It's so weird.

249
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,093
Anyway, he has dogs,

250
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,252
and you know I'm scared of dogs,
so take over for me.

251
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,732
Wait. Your boss lives in
a big mansion, right?

252
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,089
Yes, in Beverly Hills.

253
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,091
And he loves his house
more than he loves his kids.

254
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,057
So you have to behave. Okay?

255
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,096
Do not touch anything.
Do not break anything.

256
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,374
Do not go upstairs!

257
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,655
Wait, what's upstairs?

-Fred.
-Okay.

259
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,854
And do not forget to feed the dogs.

260
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,015

-You're welcome.

Please step forward.

My sister is going to kill me!

00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,255
Don't worry. We'll clean it up together,

486
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,296
as soon as I've beat my high score.

487
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,649
Hey, Fred! Come on, your turn.
Pick up a guitar, mate.

488
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,410
E.B.: (MUFFLED) Fred, I think we
got off on the wrong foot.

489
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,775
You said some things,
I flooded some things.

490

Let's start over again.

491
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,170
Fred? Why am I in a box?

492
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,975
This seems like the sort of thing
a serial killer might do.

493
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,689
Is this going to be a surprise?

494
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,731
All right, come on. Out.

495
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,738
Oh! Are we going for a hike?

496
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,579
Better! We're
releasing you into the wild.

You're going to leave me here?

Fred, mate. I'll behave.

I'll clean up my mess.
I'll do the dishes.

Not your problem.
There are no dishes in the wild.

No. Fred. But I'm special.

Well, we're all special.

So what? So you talk and you poop candy.

00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,209
Could you do it in someone else's life?

529
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,291
No, you're right. It's not your concern.

530
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:16,214
And in two weeks, maybe you can explain
to the children of the world

531
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,098
why they didn't get
their Easter baskets.

Yes! I knew it! I knew it.
I knew you were real. I knew it!

539
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,778
What are you talking about?
Of course I'm real.

540
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,929
No.

541
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,693
When I was a kid,
I saw you on Easter morning.

542
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,614
-You did?
-Yeah.

543
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,658
That was you, right?

544
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,018
Absolutely. No question.

545
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,569
Okay. Because you do
look a little different. Was it...

546
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,220
I don't know, have you lost weight?
Or maybe it's the clothes.

547
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,376
You're talking about the old guy.

548
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,402
Yeah. We got rid of him.

549
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,492
-He didn't understand children.
-Ah.

550
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,493
He didn't get that
children sometimes just want to drum.

551
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,016
I mean, dream.
Sometimes they just want to dream.

552
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,539
Children dream.

553
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,020
Yeah. So he had to go, anyway, this guy.

554
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,300
Right.

555
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,735
Well, it's a good thing
you got rid of him, then.

556
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,929
Exactly.

557
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,580
So... Wait a minute.
Why are you here now?

558
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,619
Just doing a little last minute recon
for Easter deliveries.

Finding ideal egg hiding locations.
There is one. That's perfect!

Compiling a list of kids
with chocolate allergies.

561
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,055
That kind of thing.
It's all very technical.

00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,529
Okay.

00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,131
Oh, man. I'm really late.

565
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,290
Late for what? What are we doing?

566
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,019
I have a job interview.
You're staying here.

567
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,933
But here is boring. Let me come
with you. I could be a job reference.

568
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,290
Thank you, I appreciate that.
Look, I really need this job,

569
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,496
and I don't think anyone
there is going to be able to handle you.

570
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,538
I'm not sure I can handle you.
So, just do me a favor? Wait in the car.

571
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,415
Fred, I don't want to get your hopes up,

572
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:18,014
but I think you're definitely going
to get this job.

-Be good.
-Yes, sir.

I know. I called.

That doesn't make you any earlier.

Uh-huh.

people get when they walk in here.

But I'm just going to go

Yeah, my parents have moved in with me.

-That has sort of been a full-time job.
-Mmm-hmm.

619
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,529
It's fine. It just gets in the way
of writing my novel, is all.

620
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,378
You're writing a novel?
What is that about?

621
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,778
It's about a crippled soldier who,
in the future, goes to another planet

622
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,413
and he becomes
one of the indigenous people

who are blue and live in the forest.

Not really.

626
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,616
So, why don't we take a walk

00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,332
and I can tell you a little bit
about the company?

00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,535
Okay.

629

So, the good news is,
we tend to promote from within.

630

-Mailroom.
-Is that a problem?

632

No, no, I love mail. I get lots of mail.

00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,773
and on my desk by yesterday.

641
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,419
What do you do?

642
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,455
I would make 30 copies,
and I would do what you said with them.

643
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,369
(SNIFFS)

644
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,458
I smell potential.

645
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,931
Oh, Mrs. Beck, I was wanting to talk
to you about my lunch.

646
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,613
(WHISPERING) Fred. Fred!

647
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,014
What is wrong with you?

648
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,931
This is an extreme emergency.

649
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,897
You're ruining this for me.
You really need to go.

650
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,777
You're right. I'll create a diversion

651
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,771
and we'll escape in the ensuing chaos.

652
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,969
E.B., no! Get back here!

653
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,255
-Fred?
-Yeah.

654
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:03,298
I got a good feeling about this place.
Where to next?

655
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,975
(BLUES MUSIC PLAYING)

656
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,291
Sounding good to me. But where is Ricky?

657
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,735
We need to put a back beat behind that.

658
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,855
A back beat.

659
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,698
I think Ricky went out for coffee.

660
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,809
(DRUMS PLAYING)

661
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,058
-I guess he's back.
-How you feeling, Ricky?

662
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,454
Yeah, I'm smashing.

663
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,213
(IN DEEP VOICE) I mean, I'm fine.
I'm just fine, daddy-o.

664
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,329
(SCATTING)

665
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,534
Well, then let's do it.

666
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,655
(SONG RESUMES)

667
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,691
Okay, so this our sport...

668
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,649
Oh.

669
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,648
This is our sports-game
motion-capture studio.

670
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,809
Mmm-hmm.

671
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,533
-In here?
-Yeah.

672
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,655
Ah! Hockey.

673
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,373
It's golf.

674
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,731
And this is our sound recording studio
for our music games.

675
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,977
We've done Extreme Rock Master,
Extreme Jazz Master,

676
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,699
and now we're doing
Extreme Blues Master.

677
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,891
Sounds like a cool idea.

678
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:41,009
Whoa, you got the Blind Boys of...

679
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,938
(SOFTLY) Quit it!
I'm going to kill you so bad! Get out!

680
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,971
Okay, Fred, let's try and keep moving...

681
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,893
-I'm all of a sudden not feeling
so good. -Oh.

682
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,857
-Do you have a restroom?
-Yeah.

683
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,009
Where is that?

684
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,059
(IN OWN VOICE) That was brilliant!

685
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,449
(IN DEEP VOICE) I mean, that was tight.

686
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,297
Sounded all right.
But I know my drummer when I hear him.

687
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,413
So, who are you, boy?

688
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,936
Okay, I admit it. I'm not a blues man.
My name is E.B.

689
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,732
I'm just some guy off the street

690
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,618
with two sticks of wood and a dream.

691
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,054
I understand if you throw me out.

692
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,619
I get it if you don't
want to give me a break.

693
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,298
Hey, slow down, friend.

694
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:43,493
You know, we have a buddy who is always
on the lookout for new talent.

695
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:47,977
And the man is a genius.
He is the godfather of entertainment.

696
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,619
And he's having auditions tomorrow.

697
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:53,091
The Hoff? You mean he can help me?

698
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,408
If he like you.

699
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,968
Wow. Thanks, Blind Boys.

700
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,858
Good luck, little rabbit.

701
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,254
Wait, how did you know I was...

702
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,615
Mmm!

703
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,253
Clever gents.

704
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,257
E.B.: So, Fred, how'd it go?

705
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,978
FRED: Don't say a word.

706
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,529
(GRUNTING)

707
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,018
FRED: Can I get a little
clarification, here?

708
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,619
Is this what the Easter Bunny does now?

709
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,816
He just goes house to house,
messing up people's lives?

710
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,498
Well, that is just hurtful.

711
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,815
Besides, you're selling yourself short.

712
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,135
They were going to
shove you in the mail room.

713
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,370
Well, excuse me, but I happen to think
you're better than that.

714
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,695
You don't know me, okay? We just met.

715
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:39,893
I can tell. You give off this aura
of untapped potential.

716
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:41,975
I do?

717
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,179
Don't pull that with me, rabbit, okay?
I'm too smart for you.

718
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,938
But, Fred, I'm serious.

719
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,693
You're destined to do something great.
I just know it.

720
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,055
I've heard that one before.

721
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,216
You'll find an awesome job.

722
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,535
Hey. Look, what about this?

723
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,293
-Dog walker?
-No.

724
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,019
-TSA Officer?
-No.

725
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,610
What about this one? It looks exciting.

726
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,498
Wind in your hair, hot babe on your arm.

727
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,339
That's a car ad.

728
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,849
You should buy that car, then.

729
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,049
(SIGHING)

730
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,735
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

731
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,373
Ah! Señor. How you doing, jefe?

732
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,693
Am I disturbing?

733
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,528
It's never been this quiet in here.

734
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,299
Yeah, it's so depressing.

735
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:30,417
You should clear this out.
Make a new den or a clubhouse.

736
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,213
Like a man-cave! It'll be fun.

737
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:36,214
I called his dreams ridiculous.

738
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,579
What kind of father does that?

739
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,928
No, no, señor.

740
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,620
I will not permit you
to beat yourself up over this.

741
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,732
Anybody would be lucky
to have a father such as you.

742
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,095
Thank you, Carlos. I miss him.

743
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,613
Me, too, señor.

744
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,379
A son is very difficult to replace.

745
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:56,731
Difficult, but not impossible.

746
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,134
Carlos...

747
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,291
What the... What's that on your head?

748
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,571
What? My new earmuffs?

749
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,932
It's a cold spring
this year, you know? Brr!

750
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,815
Oh.

751
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,931
Anyway, what am I going to do?

752
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,778
I know, how can you deliver Easter

753
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,892
with this tremendous burden
on your old, frail shoulders?

754
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,971
Hey, hey, hey, easy with the "old."

755
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,091
No, I'm just saying,
like, compared to me.

756
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,899
Surely you're not thinking
of making the trip yourself?

757
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,015
What choice do we have?

758
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,136
We can improvise. I mean...

759
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:31,409
-Does it even have to be a bunny?
-What?

760
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,651
I suppose, given these troubled times,

761
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:38,416
even a humble chick could do the job.

762
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,935
(LAUGHING)

763
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,769
Really, Carlos.

764
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,573
(LAUGHING AWKWARDLY)

765
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,129
Wow. I mean, that is funny.

766
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,450
Can you imagine that?
A chick delivering Easter?

767
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:50,814
That's ridiculous.

768
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,373
Oh, dear me.

769
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,894
But I appreciate
you trying to cheer me up, though.

770
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,938
Please. It is my pleasure
to amuse you, señor.

771
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,090
(LAUGHING) A chick delivering...

772
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,815
Fred, I was wondering if...

773
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,692
Are you doing anything tomorrow?

774
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,854
Tomorrow I get to start my new job
at the video game company.

775
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,655
Wait a second. No, that didn't work out.

776
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,816
I know. I know. I'm sorry about that.

777
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:25,330
But do you know what?
Every cloud has a silver lining.

778
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:28,850
And behold this silver lining, Fred!

779
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,095
The Hoff?

780
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:34,898
Yes, please. I just need a ride.

781
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:36,009
Mmm.

782
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,738
-No.
-Come on, Fred.

783
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,852
This is my one big chance.
I'll do anything.

784
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,531
Even get out of your life.

785
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:50,850
I take you to Hoff Knows Talent,
and that's it, we're done.

786
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,732
Bunny's honor. (SPITS)

787
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:53,895
Right here, mate.

788
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,772
It's okay. A verbal agreement is fine.

789
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,771
Now, you realize, you can't talk.

790
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,373
No. I can.

791
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,575
No, what I mean is, you shouldn't talk.

792
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,258
What? Like, ever?

793
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,574
Yeah, "ever" would be wonderful.

794
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,691
But from now on,
especially not in front of other people.

795
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,931
They might freak out
and want to dissect your brain.

796
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,937
Dissect? That's a bit extreme.

797
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,096
There's an easy explanation
as to why I can talk.

798
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,017
It's a simple combination
of cuteness and magic.

799

back there. Unquote.

Sure, doll.

E.B.: Fred, I've just had an idea.

811
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:52,490
When I'm a famous rock star, I'm
going to buy a mansion just like this

812
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:55,936
and make you sleep in the garage
in a topsy-turvy switcheroo.

813
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,773
-What do you think?
-Oh, man. My sister is here.

814
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,259
You never told me you had a sister.

815
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,054
There's still so much we don't know
about each other, Fred.

816
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,732
If she goes upstairs, I'm dead.

817
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,094
-Why?
-Why?

818
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,249
Let me take you back to this morning

819

you trashed the bedroom.

Fred, leave this to me.
I'll smooth it out with her. Ow!

-Look at me.

for me right now. I was just leaving.

There you are. (CHUCKLES) Mmm!

833

I'm on this North Beach diet.
It's carrots only.

834
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,978
That is why they're all over the house.

835
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,812
I was going to clean them up, though.

836

-Okay, Fred, how did the interview go?
-Yes?

837
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:54,208
Oh! Thank you for asking.
Amazing! I aced it.

Maybe we shouldn't be playing with him

to be up here in the first place. So...

00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:19,737
Thank you, David Hasselhoff!

960
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,532
I will not let you down.

961
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:25,369
This is a golden opportunity
and one I intend to realize fully!

962
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,054
Hey, wait.

963
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,057
You're not surprised
that I'm a talking rabbit.

964
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:32,934
Little man, my best
friend's a talking car.

965
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:40,250
Can you make it to a live taping
of the show Saturday night?

966
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,893
I'll send a limo.

967
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,018
Did you hear him? Did you hear The Hoff?

968
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:45,294
I'm on my way, Fred!

969
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:47,257
It sounds like The Hoff really dug you.

970
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:50,378
I mean, he is a good actor,
but I think he was sincere.

971
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,289
Thanks, mate.
And don't think I've forgotten our deal.

972
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,138
You've done your part.

973
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:57,728
And now I'm ready to
get out of your life.

974
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:02,093
Good. Yeah, good.

975
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:06,572
We've had some good times, eh?
Haven't we, Fred?

976
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:09,416
Yeah, there were a few.

977
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,249
You validated my whole childhood dream.

978
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,171
-And then, what else?
-(GASPS)

979
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,170
Let me think. Good times.

980
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,134
Well, maybe just one good time.
But the main thing is

981
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:24,332
I got to meet the guy
on my second grade lunchbox.

982
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,458
Hasselhoff, wow!

983
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,615
E.B.?

984
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,615
E.B.?

985
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,928
E.B.?

986
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,939
Psst! Fred!

987
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,335
What are you doing?

988
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,531
-Pink Berets.
-Pink what?

989
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,178
Pink Berets.

990
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,651
-There is nobody here.
-Oh yes, there is.

991
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,975
If they see me,
they'll take me back to Easter Island

992
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:51,335
and I'll never get my chance to drum!

993
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:53,894
Pink Berets? Huh? Sounds super fierce.

994
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,618
Don't be fooled by their adorable name.

995
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,612
They're the Easter Bunny's Royal Guard!

996
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,020
But you're the Easter Bunny! Aren't you?

997
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,017
Of course I am, technically.

998
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:07,129
What do you mean, "technically"?

999
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:09,290
I'll explain later. Just get in the car.

1000
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:19,893
Look, I was supposed
to take over this year, but I ran away.

1001
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,412
What are you, crazy?

1002
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,854
Who wouldn't want to
be the Easter Bunny?

1003
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,254
That's, like, the greatest job ever!

1004
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:28,412
Yeah, you'd think so.
But it's what my dad wants, not me.

1005
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:32,095
He expects so much. What's left for me
to do but let him down?

1006
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,933
Sounds familiar.

1007
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,656
Sometimes fathers just don't get it.

1008
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:39,340
He told me I only ever think of myself.

1009
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,411
Other times,
they hit the nail right on the head.

1010
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,933
Come on, Fred.

1011
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,011
I know we said
we'd go our own separate ways,

1012
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,692
but please, you've got to protect me.

1013
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:47,849
Look, I'm sorry,

1014
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,771
but I can't really leave you places,

1015
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:51,817
I can't really take you places.

1016
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,538
And I've got to go to
my sister's play tonight.

1017
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:55,736
Oh, I like plays.

1018
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:58,977
We should go see a play
that my sister's not in

1019
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:00,698
and that my family will
not be attending.

1020
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,213
I understand.

1021
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:06,850
Just drop me off at the bus station.
I'm sure I'll be fine.

1022
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,895
I could be one of those street drummers,

1023
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,698
with a bucket!

1024
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,051
-Hi. How you doing?
-Good.

1025
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,291
-Who's your kid playing?
-An egg.

1026
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:26,972
-An egg?
-Yeah.

1027
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:28,937
Wow, that's something.

1028
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:31,534
My kid is the Easter Bunny.

1029
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,489
The one that makes it all happen.

1030
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:38,048
All right, Dad,
all the roles are equally important.

1031
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:39,819
Sure, sure.

1032
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:40,935

your seats. The play is about to begin.

Um...

Fred has been studying ventriloquism.

1052
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:53,057
Yeah! I might do it professionally.

1053

You should be nicer to your son.

It's just a thought.

She's so fine she can't be beat

Fred, seems like we made quite
an impression on you the other night.

1092
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:58,769
Is this your new career?

1093
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:01,328
Upstaging grade-schoolers
with your ventriloquist puppet?

1094
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:04,258
No, no, I got lots of
other stuff going on.

1095
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,455
Yeah.

1096
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,173
-There it is.
-What?

1097
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,610
That look. The complete
and utterly disappointed look.

1098
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:13,928
Well, I'm sorry, Fred,

1099
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:16,853
but can you give me just,
I don't know,

1100
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:20,459
one reason not to be disappointed?

1101
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:21,734
Well...

1102
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:24,135
-Just one.
-Yeah.

1103
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,095
Fred?

1104
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:36,855
Fred, where'd you go?

1105
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:38,732
Yeah, I'm right here.

1106
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:43,735
I just remembered I have a really
great solid lead, actually.

1107
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,373
-You do?
-Yeah, a great job.

1108
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:46,893
-Tell me about it.
-I can't really tell you about it.

1109
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:48,379
But it's big. You're going to love it.

1110
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,778
It's really big!

1111

the "Mr. Serious" all of a sudden?

1112
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:58,776
Wait, is this where you tell me
you want to see other rabbits?

1113
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:01,135
Because I'm open-minded, Fred.

1114
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:07,016
E.B., I have the most amazing idea.

1115
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,013
When I was a kid, I told everyone

1116
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:11,579
that I saw the Easter Bunny, right?

even though

1119
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:18,493
he left me this.

1120
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:22,330
This chocolate bunny, which I kept.

1121
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:24,295
Oh, dear.

1122
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,815
And tonight, it just hit me.

1123
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,968
I realized that it was
my destiny to see him.

1124
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:34,700
Just like it was my destiny to meet you.

1125

the Easter Bunny, right?

1128

1129
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:42,849
Who?

1130
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,855
Me!

1131
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:49,058
I'm sorry, Fred. Would you mind
repeating that in my good ear?

1132
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,335
I want to be the Easter Bunny.

1133
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:55,969
What was that for?

1134
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:57,971
That is for people who have gone loony!

1135
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:00,051
A human Easter Bunny?

1136
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:02,330
Come on, Fred! It doesn't make sense.

1137
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:04,729
A bunny makes no sense.
You deliver eggs.

1138
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:07,091
If you wanna get all logical,
bring logic into this,

1139
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:08,255
you should be an Easter Chicken.

1140
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:09,535
What? Come on.

1141
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:12,612
People might resist it at first.
But, hey, change can be a good thing.

1142
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:15,538
You don't want the job anyway.
The pressure is ungodly!

1143
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:17,019
It did a number on me.

1144
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,977
Do you know there was
a period of roughly nine months

1145
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:21,290
where the sight of a colored egg
made me want to vomit?

1146
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:23,331
And rabbits are
physically unable to vomit.

1147
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:26,378
So it was just hours of... (RETCHING)

Nothing coming out.

-I don't care.
-Imagine that, Fred.

1150
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:31,249
Don't care.

1151
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:33,535
If you can be a drummer,
I can be the Easter Bunny.

1152
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:36,418
Fred, you can't just
be the Easter Bunny.

-Eh.

to be fit. -Ow!

And you're a little scrawny.

1156
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:45,338
Finally, the Easter Bunny
has got to have

1157
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:46,899
lightning-fast reflexes. Hi-ya!

I'm serious. I can do this.

01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:33,856
Who is this person
and what's he doing here?

1277
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:36,856
Wow, you're him.

1278
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:40,493
The big guy.
I'm Fred O'Hare. I met you...

1279
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:43,048
Well, I didn't meet you.
I saw you when I was a kid.

1280
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:44,175
You look great.

1281
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:45,818
Señor Bunny, brace yourself.

1282
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:49,097
This heartless human,
he has killed your son!

1283
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:50,892
What? E.B.?

1284
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:52,892
Did you say "kill"?

1285
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:54,618
No, I didn't kill E.B..

1286
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:56,008
Oh! Liar!

1287
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:59,092
This can't be so.
Where are the Pink Berets?

1288
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,772
(GASPS) No!

1289
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:12,779
Wait a minute. That's not...

1290
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,538
Silence, human!

1291
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:17,817
Can't you see you have broken
his poor old heart?

1292
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,249
Are you kidding me?

1293
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:21,137
Old friend, I share your sorrow.

1294
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:23,774
E.B. was like your son to me.

1295
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:25,693
I'm trying to keep it together.

1296
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:28,692
But don't you worry,
I will take care of Easter.

1297
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:32,295
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Does anyone care that
that's a Butterball turkey?

1298
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:34,456
No, no, that is E.B.

1299
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:36,571
He has the same shirt and everything.

1300
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:38,571
My deepest condolences.

1301
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:40,168
Attention, all bunnies.

1302
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:43,451
There will be a service for E.B.
in the egg painting room.

1303
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:45,812
Carrots and coffee to follow.

1304
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:58,295
Carlos. What are you up to?

1305
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:00,732
It's called a coup d'etat.

1306
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:03,175
Which is French for coup d'etat!

1307

(LAUGHING OMINOUSLY)

1308
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:06,054
But, Carlos.

1309
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:08,489
You've been my most trusted
number two for years.

1310
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:11,180
Guess what? I am sick
of doing number two.

1311
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:13,655
It is our time for number one!

1312
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:15,452
Yeah? We the bosses now.

1313
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:16,893
All hail Carlos!

1314
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:18,976
We the bosses! We the bosses! Woohoo!

1315

Seize him!

1319
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:38,969
Woohoo!

1320
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:42,691
Hey! Don't do that.

1321
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:46,130
He's a beloved holiday icon!

1322
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:47,255
No!

(E.B.'S DAD SCREAMING)

1324
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:55,212
You can do this.
You are the world's best rabbit drummer.

1325
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,418
You are a superstar.

1326
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:00,289
You are a jerk for abandoning Fred.

1327
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:02,416
Hey, I don't need
that kind of voice in my head!

1328
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,895
Yeah, well, you should have thought
of that before you abandoned Fred.

1329
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:06,811
Look, you better tell me
something positive about me.

1330
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:09,329
-I can't. You abandoned Fred.
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Oh! Hello, who is this gorgeous devil?

1332
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:13,938
Is Eb in here, please?

1333
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,295
"Eb"?

1334
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:16,933
It's "E.B." That's me.

1335
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:20,929
Oh, all right, well, E.B.,
you're wanted on stage in two minutes.

1336
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,256
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

1337
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:34,094
Welcome to Hoff Knows Talent.

1338
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:38,459
You guys look great. There are all kinds
of exciting acts tonight.

1339
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:40,139
HASSELHOFF: There he is.

1340
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,973
How's my little guy?

1341
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:46,896
Actually, David Hasselhoff,
I've got a problem.

1342
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:48,015
Hmm.

1343
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:56,213
Is it the jitters?

1344
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:59,895
Believe me, even I used to get them.
Now, I find a good way...

1345
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:01,811
No, it's not the jitters, David.

1346
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:05,489
I'm starting to realize
I might be a really selfish rabbit.

1347
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:06,973
Look, I love drumming.

1348
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:08,692
But when my friend needed me most,

1349
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:12,170
I left him in a house
full of highly trained ninja bunnies.

1350
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:13,779
What am I going to do?

1351
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:15,609
Hmm.

1352
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:18,420
A dilemma as old as time itself.

1353
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:21,060
I know that if I left right now,
I'd be giving up fame.

1354
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:23,096
-And untold riches.
-And untold riches.

1355
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:24,818
And all the bunnies you could ever want.

1356
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:25,969
Yes, and all the...

1357
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:28,130
You're not really helping much, David.

1358
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:29,812
Like, at all!

1359
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:32,449
And Fred could be in real trouble.

1360
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:36,299
Go to him.

1361
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:43,335
Go to him.

1362

ANNOUNCER: Give it up for
Mr. David Hasselhoff!

Anybody home?

1366
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:00,329
Fred?

1367
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:11,329
Uh-oh.

1368
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:18,536
CARLOS: The Easter moon is on the rise.

1369
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:19,975
At midnight,

1370
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:24,975
her radiant beams will fill up the Egg
of Destiny with magic.

1371
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:28,058
Then, at last, Señor Bunny,

1372
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:30,893
I will be Easter's new king!

1373
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,618
Carlos, I'm warning you!

1374
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:36,010
The Egg of Destiny is too dangerous
in the hands of a chick.

1375
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:38,489
Its power can only
be wielded by a bunny.

1376
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:41,492
Oh, yes? Well, look at me wielding.
I'm wielding!

1377
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:43,969
Ooh-ooh. I'm wielding it again. Okay?

1378
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:47,331
Oh, Carlos, can I wield
the Egg of Destiny? Please?

1379
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:48,455
No.

1380
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:49,734
Can I at least touch it?

1381
01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:51,738
-Ow!
-There, you touched it.

1382
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:52,969
That was harsh.

1383
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:54,732
But, Carlos, think of the children.

1384
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:56,651
Yes, but I am! The childrens.

1385
01:17:56,740 --> 01:17:59,129
They don't want candy and chocolate.

1386
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:00,494
From now on,

1387
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:04,971
their baskets will be filled with clumps
of bird seed, dried crickets,

1388
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:07,858
and the world's finest worms!

1389

01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:12,814
ALL: Mmm!

1391
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:15,450
Have you completely lost your mind?

1392
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:18,418
Silence! You see,
this is why he must go.

1393
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:22,652
It's this lousy attitude of his.
Well, no more!

1394
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:27,373
The more sensitive chicks in the room
may want to avert their eyes.

1395
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:29,497
What about a compromise, okay?

1396
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:32,333
The bunny gets Easter one year
and the chick gets it the next.

1397
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:33,978
Enough of the chitty-chatty.

1398
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:36,779
Bye-bye, Easter Bunny.

1399

but I'm alive.

01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:01,098
Put him on the belt, boys.

-Oh, no! E.B.!
-Son!

Oh!

1414
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,655
Somebody help! Help us!

1415
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:21,529
What are you doing? Don't worry,
Dad, Fred. I'll be right there.

Yes, yes, they are. Horrible stuff!

You see, my friends?
It is just like I told you, no?

1423
