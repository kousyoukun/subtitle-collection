2
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,110
don't come for me if there are mistakes

3
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,090
He's here.

4
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,920
Professor Perlman.
-Welcome, welcome.

5
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,340
Thank you so much.
-It's so nice to-

6
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,760
Oh my goodness, you're- 
you're bigger than your picture!

7
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,870
Well I couldn't get all of me in the photo, 
that's the problem.

8
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,680
Mrs. Perlman.
-Annella.

9
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,000
Oliver. Very nice to meet you, 
thank you for having me in your home.

10
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,590
Elio!

11
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,220
You must be exhausted.

12
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,540
Ah, what gave me away?

13
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,310
Elio, Oliver. Oliver, Elio.

14
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,100
How you doing?
-Nice to meet you. Elio.

15
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,730
You must be exhausted!

16
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,970
Little bit.
-Ha ha ha! Come, come, come.

17
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,820
May I bring your things up to your room?
-Uh, sure, yeah.

18
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,620
My room?

19
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,370
Follow him.

20
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,480
You're very welcome here.

21
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,810
Our home is your home.

22
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,900
Hello!

23
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:29,970
Hey.

24
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,960
Oh.

25
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,330
My room is now your room.

26
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,820
I'll be next door.

27
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,040
We have to share the bathroom.

28
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,130
It's my only way out.

29
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,010
We're being called for dinner!

30
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,360
(Oliver snores)

31
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,810
Oh, sorry the uh...

32
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,880
We're being called for dinner.

33
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,960
Um, yeah, um, I'm probably gonna pass.

34
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
Will you make me an excuse for me 
for your mom though?

35
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,840
Thanks man.

36
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,690
So this is your old room, huh?

37
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,290
Thanks.

38
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,320
Later.

39
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,540
Wow look at this!

40
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,540
Good morning professor, good morning.
-From the dead.

41
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,730
Was I up that long?
-It seems like it. How- how are you?

42
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,210
I- uh- well, rested now, thank you.

43
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,320
Glad, would you like some espresso?

44
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,520
I would love some, thank you very much.

45
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,280
This looks amazing. 
I didn't take your seat did I?

46
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,100
Oh, no, no, no, it's ok, please.

47
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,820
Did you- did you recover from your trip?

48
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,930
Uh, I did, yeah. Big time, thank you.

49
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,330
I could show you around.

50
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,330
That'd be great, thank you.
Um, is there a-

51
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,600
is there a bank in town? I'd love to start an account while I'm here.

52
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,240
Sorry.

53
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,840
Ah, it happens to the best of us.

54
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:47,560
Yeah, well.

55
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,380
None of our residents have ever 
had a local bank account.

56
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,260
Really?
-Mm.

57
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,540
Should I take him to ...?

58
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,060
I think they're closed for summer vacation.

59
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,620
You try uh, Crema.

60
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,620
Crema?

61
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,980
Is this your orchard?

62
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
These are Annella's trees.
-Oh, wow.

63
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,060
Pomegranate.

64
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,460
Have another egg.

65
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,210
No, no, no.

66
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,060
I know myself too well, if I have a second 
I'm just gonna have a third,

67
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,320
 and then a fourth and then you're just 
gonna have to roll me out of here.

68
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,140
Delicious.

69
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,850
Darling?

70
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:31,940
Thank you.

71
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,770
Should I give him Anchise's bike?

72
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,600
What does one do around here?

73
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,000
Wait for the summer to end.

74
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,280
Yeah?

75
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,180
What do you do in the winter? 
Wait for summer to come?
-Well,

76
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,480
we only come here for Christmas
and some other vacations.

77
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,490
Christmas? I thought you were- 
I thought you were Jewish?
-and Easter as well.

78
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:32,460
Well, we are Jewish but also American, Italian, 
French- somewhat a typical combination.

79
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,380
Besides my family you're probably the 
only other Jew to set foot in this town.

80
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,080
I'm from a small town in New England. 
I know what it's like to be the odd Jew out.

81
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,860
So what do you do around here?

82
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:54,420
Read books, transcribe music, swim at 
the river, go out at night. I don't know.

83
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,660
That sounds fun.

84
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,250
Alright buddy, thanks for the help.

85
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,460
Oops, sorry. Sorry about that.

86
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,280
It's alright.

87
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,140
Alright, later!

88
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,120
What do you have there?

89
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,120
That should all be-

90
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:39,210
What is this? Uh, these are the continuation 
of these archeology department.

91
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,280
These are archeology? Yeah, those archeology, 
the rest of these should be history.

92
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,460
More apricot juice?

93
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,960
Yeah.

94
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,620
Here.
-Thank you.

95
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,620
Help yourself to some more.

96
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,780
The word 'apricot' comes from the Arabic.

97
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,260
It's like the words 'algebra', 'alchemy', 'alcohol'.

98
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,140
It derives from an Arabic noun combined 
with the Arabic article 'al' before it.

99
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,920
The origin of our Italian "albicocca"...

100
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,370
is 'albaricoque'.

101
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,300
Now it's amazing that today in Israel, 
in many Arab countries,

102
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,780
the fruit's referred to by a totally different name:

103
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,200
"mishmish".

104
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,960
I may have to disagree with you there professor.

105
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,620
Ah?

106
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,700
I'm gonna talk in etymology 
so just bear with me a second.

107
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,580
Um, you're right in the case that most Latin words 
do find their origins in Greek words, however

108
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,520
in the case of apricot it's a little bit 
more of a complicated journey.

109
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,440
Ah, how so?

110
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,260
Ah, well here the Greek actually 
takes over from the Latin.

111
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,420
Latin word being "praecocum" or "praecoquis"

112
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,020
so it's pre-cooked or pre-ripened as you know, 
not to be precocious or premature.

113
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,760
And the Byzantines to go on, 
then borrowed "praecox"

114
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,000
which became "praecocia" 
which then became "baricoci"

115
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,640
which is how the Arabs got "albaricoque".

116
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,520
Courtesy of etymology 101.

117
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,520
Flying colours.

118
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,040
He does this every year.

119
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,700
... let's move here.

120
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,700
How do you know about this place?

121
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,680
Okay!

122
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,060
No, no, no, no, no!

123
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,000
Perfect timing!

124
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,340
What's the matter, you alright?
-Huh?

125
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,980
Pinch your nerve?
-I'm okay.

126
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,080
Here, hold this.

127
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,770
Trust me, I'm about to be a doctor.

128
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,640
Hey, hey, hey, come here. 
See, that's the problem.

129
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,820
You're too stressed. You just gotta relax a little bit.
-I am relaxing.

130
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,760
Marzia? Come here for a minute.

131
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,220
Back me up here.

132
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,100
Feel that, right there? It's too tight, 
right? He needs to relax.
-Oliver!

133
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,280
Later!

134
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,280
You should relax more.

135
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,920
Ok guys, ready?

136
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,320
Woo!

137
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,040
Ok, our ball, our ball, our ball!

138
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,040
Twelve serving eleven.

139
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,040
Mine, mine, mine, mine!

140
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,040
Yours, yours, yours!

141
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,560
I don't think he's arrogant.

142
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:59,440
Just watch, this is how he'll say goodbye to us 
when the time comes with his, "later".

143
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,360
Meanwhile we'll have to put up with him for 
six long weeks won't we, darling.

144
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,500
I think he's shy.

145
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
You'll grow to like him.

146
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,560
What if I grow to hate him?

147
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,060
(Elio sighs)

148
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,700
Elio. Play something.

149
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,900
You're spoiling everyone's fun.

150
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,660
Hey! 
-Hey.

151
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,960
What you doing? 
-Reading.

152
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,200
How come you're not with everyone 
else down by the river?

153
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,640
I have an allergy.

154
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,660
Yeah, me too.

155
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,440
Maybe we have the same one.

156
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,380
Why don't you and I go swimming?
-Right now?

157
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,440
Yeah, come on!
Let's go!

158
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,160
Do we have to go right now?

159
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,460
I'll go get changed. Meet you downstairs.
-Okay.

160
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,600
See you downstairs.

161
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,320
Elio, what are you doing?

162
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,840
Reading my music.
-No you're not.

163
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,820
Thinking, then.
-Yeah?

164
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,880
'Bout what.

165
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,280
It's private.

166
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,540
You're not gonna tell me?
-I'm not gonna tell you.

167
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,680
He's not gonna tell me what he's thinking about.
-(Annella) Elio!

168
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:33,440
I guess I'll go hang out with your mom.
More apricot juice!

169
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,060
Good boy, thank god you're helping me.

170
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,160
Sounds nice.

171
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,160
Thought you didn't like it.

172
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,920
Play it again, will ya?

173
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,360
Follow me.

174
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,720
That sounds different. Did you change it? Why?
-I changed it a little bit.

175
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,560
I just played it the way Liszt would have
played it if he'd altered Bach's version.

176
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,780
Play that again.
-Play what again?

177
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,560
The thing you played outside.
-Oh, you want me to play the thing I played outside?

178
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,880
Please.
-Ah. Of course.

179
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,140
I can't believe you changed it again.
-Oh I changed it a little bit.

180
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,220
Yeah, why?

181
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,320
I just played it the way Busoni would have
played it if he'd altered Liszt's version.

182
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,000
And what is wrong with Bach, the way Bach 
would have played Bach's version?

183
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,000
-Bach never wrote it for the guitar.

184
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,580
In fact, we're not even sure Bach wrote it at all.

185
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,580
-Forget I asked!

186
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,900
It's young Bach.
He dedicated it to his brother.

187
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,920
Hey, professor.
-Hello.

188
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,220
Oh, here, please. Join me.
-Thank you.

189
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,620
Be honest, how bad is it?

190
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,620
(Michael) I think your insight's...

191
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,640
Ciao.
-Ciao.

192
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,040
Elio. You sleeping?
-Hm?

193
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,860
I was.
-Listen to this dribble. Tell me what you think.

194
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,280
Wait.
-What?

195
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,820
Can't hear you.

196
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,200
For the early Greeks, Heidegger contends, 
this underlying hiddenness is constitutive of the way beings are,

197
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,400
not only in relation to themselves but also
in relation to other entities generally.

198
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,920
In other words, they do not construe hiddenness merely or 
primarily in terms of entities' relation to human beings.

199
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,620
Does that make any sense to you?
Doesn't make any sense to me.

200
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,240
I don't think it makes any sense to your dad either.

201
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,940
Maybe it did when he wrote it.

202
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,820
That might be the kindest thing anybody 
has said to me in months.

203
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:01,300
Kind?
-Yep. Kind.

204
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,800
(Armie Hammer dances quite horribly)

205
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,120
We almost had sex last night, Marzia and me.

206
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,480
Why didn't you?

207
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,740
I don't know.

208
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:21,060
Well you know it's better to have tried than failed, right?

209
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,040
All I had to do was find the courage to

210
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,960
reach out and touch. She would have said yes.

211
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,960
Well, try again later.

212
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,960
Try what later?

213
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,680
I just heard from the people in Sirmione,
they say they've come up with something.

214
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,440
Oh! Fantastic!

215
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,880
Going there today.
Would you like to come along?

216
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,880
I would love to, thank you.

217
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,700
Smell this.
-Can I come too?

218
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,360
Uh, on the condition you remain silent.

219
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:49,700
Silent as in he has too many opinions or silent as in 
not telling anybody what amazing thing you've dug up?

220
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,380
Well nothing has been dug up, it's what has been brought out.
Out of the water.

221
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,840
Dad always sits up front with Anchise to navigate.

222
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,100
She seems to like you a lot.

223
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,960
More beautiful than she was last year.

224
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:29,560
I saw her naked on a night swim once... great body.

225
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,640
Tryna get me to like her?
-What would be the harm in that?

226
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,480
Not no harm, just typically like to go 
those things on my own if you don't mind.

227
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,380
Just don't play at being a good host.

228
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,860
What's going on boys?

229
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,540
Oliver, come.

230
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,040
Sit up front, be my navigator.

231
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,040
What? What?

232
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,900
Look who's here!

233
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,680
He's grown a bit, eh? 
And this is Oliver.

234
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,480
Ciao!

235
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,560
Hey boys!

236
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:31,480
The ship went down in 1827 on the way to Isola Del Garda.

237
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:38,840
Gossip has it this statue was a gift from 
Count to his lover Contralto.

238
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:47,340
There are four known sets after the Praxiteles' originals,
this fellow's at number three.

239
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,640
The Emperor Hadrian had a pair dug up at Tivoli, but uh,

240
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,940
one of the more philistine of the Farnese popes 
melted them down and had them recast as

241
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,600
a particularly voluptuous Venus.

242
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,780
Who'd like to go for a swim before we head back?

243
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,040
Elio!
-Oliver!

244
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,180
Hey, hey!
-I have to go!

245
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,980
Goodness!

246
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,040
Are you going too?
-No, no. I should stay and do some work on my book.

247
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,060
Oh, come on!
How 'bout a drink to celebrate the day?

248
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,020
Okay maybe just one.
-Alright!

249
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,760
Marzia?

250
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,620
(Elio) Cosmic fragments by Heraclitus.

251
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:36,240
(Oliver) The meaning of the river flowing is not that all things 
are changing so that we cannot encounter them twice

252
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,380
but that some things stay the same only by changing.

253
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,580
Hm.

254
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,360
Darling have you seen my Heptaméron?

255
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,620
Mafalda.

256
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,780
It's in German.

257
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,380
Okay.

258
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:50,900
Can't remember where we left off
but I think you'll like this one.

259
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,120
So, I'll translate, huh?

260
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:15,040
A handsome young knight is madly in love with a princess,
and she too is in love with him,

261
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,760
though she seems not to be entirely aware of it,

262
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,760
despite the friendship

263
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:29,060
that blossoms between them, or

264
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:32,040
perhaps because of that very friendship,

265
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,760
the young knight finds himself so-

266
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:42,100
so humbled and speechless,

267
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:46,460
but he's totally unable to bring up the subject of his love.

268
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:51,020
So one day he asks the princess, point blank,

269
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,740
"Is it better to speak, or to die?".

270
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:12,880
I'll never have the courage to ask a question like that.

271
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,500
I doubt that.

272
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,020
Hey, Eli belly.

273
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,180
You do know that you can always talk to us.

274
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,340
My mom has been reading this 
16th century French romance.

275
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,180
She read some of it to my dad and I 
the night the lights went out.

276
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:43,220
Is that about the knight that doesn't know whether to speak or die?
-Right.

277
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,120
So does he or doesn't he?

278
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,900
"Better to speak" she said.

279
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,260
But she's on her guard.

280
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,100
She senses a trap somewhere.

281
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,280
So does he speak?

282
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,540
Nope.

283
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,200
He fudges.
-Hm.

284
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,300
It figures. He's French.

285
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:26,760
I gotta go to town in a little bit to pick some things up.
-Oh, I can go I'm not doing anything today.

286
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,480
Why don't we go together?
-Right now?

287
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,980
Yeah, right now.

288
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,400
It is of course unless you have more 
important business going on.

289
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,400
(ELIO MOCKS OLIVER)

290
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,500
Mind if I put this in your bag?
-Yes, please.

291
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:15,540
I fell. I was coming home the other day 
and I scraped myself pretty badly.

292
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,720
Anchise insisted I apply some kind of witch's brew.

293
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,780
I think it helped.

294
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,800
Hold this for a second, will ya?

295
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,000
Want one?
-Sure.

296
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,860
Not bad, huh?
-Not bad at all.

297
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,540
Thought you didn't smoke.
-I don't.

298
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:50,040
So WWII, huh?
-Oh no, this is WWI.

299
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,740
You have to be at least 80 years old 
to have known any of them.

300
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,920
I never even heard of the Battle of Piave.

301
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,720
Battle of Piave was one of the 
most lethal battles of WWI.

302
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,740
A hundred and seventy thousand people died.

303
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,280
Is there anything you don't know?

304
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,540
I know nothing, Oliver.

305
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,440
Well you seem to know more than 
anybody else around here.

306
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,200
Well if only you know how little I know 
about the things that matter.

307
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,820
What things that matter?

308
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,080
You know what things.

309
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,600
Why are you telling me this?

310
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,460
'Cause I thought you should know?

311
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,220
Because you thought I should know?

312
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,380
'Cause I wanted you to know?

313
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,800
'Cause I wanted you to know.

314
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,700
'Cause I wanted you to know.

315
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,420
'Cause I wanted you to know.

316
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,420
Because there's no one else
I can say this to but you?

317
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,760
You saying what I think you're saying?

318
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,740
Don't go anywhere.
Stay right here.

319
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,600
You know I'm not going anywhere.

320
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,580
They mixed up all of my pages.
I'm going to have to retype this whole thing.

321
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:25,340
I'm not gonna have anything to work on after this.
This is gonna set me back a whole day.

322
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,040
Damnit.

323
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,360
Shouldn't have said anything.

324
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:34,260
Just pretend you never did.
-Oh, does that mean we're on speaking terms but not really?

325
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,240
Means we can't talk about those kinds of things,

326
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,000
'kay?

327
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,660
We just can't.

328
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,560
Hey!

329
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,100
Ready?
-Let's go.

330
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:03,700
Pretty much.

331
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,840
Oh my god.

332
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,960
You thirsty?
-Yeah.

333
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,680
That's Italy.

334
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,080
Come on!

335
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,820
This is my spot. 
It's all mine.

336
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,820
Come here to read.

337
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,160
Can't tell you the number of books I've read here.

338
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,200
Oh my god it's freezing!

339
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,980
Spring is in the mountains.

340
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,960
The water comes straight down from there.

341
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,200
I like the way you say things.

342
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,380
Don't know why you're always 
putting yourself down, though.

343
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,800
So you won't? I guess?

344
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,960
You really that afraid of what I think?

345
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,220
You're making things very difficult for me.

346
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:15,860
(Elio sighs)

347
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,500
I love this, Oliver.

348
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,300
(Oliver sighs)

349
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,080
What?

350
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,740
Everything.

351
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:38,900
Us, you mean?

352
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:44,120
Ah, it's not bad. It's not bad.

353
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,280
Better now?

354
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,740
No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.

355
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,760
We should go.
-Why?

356
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,060
I know myself, 'kay?

357
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,640
And we've been good. 
We haven't done anything to be ashamed of.

358
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,000
And that's a good thing.

359
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,680
I wanna be good.

360
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,120
Okay?

361
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,760
Am I offending you?

362
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:19,920
Just don't.

363
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:29,380
I think it's starting to get infected.

364
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:34,480
Stop at the pharmacist on the way back.
-Excellent idea.

365
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,000
Elio?

366
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:22,160
Elio, you alright?

367
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,720
Sit for a second.

368
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,340
If you insist.

369
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,200
That wasn't my fault, right?
-No.

370
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,020
I'm a mess.

371
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,020
Well.

372
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,640
The kitchen table sure is.

373
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:53,020
Ow, where'd you learn to do that?

374
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,180
My bubbe used to do this for us when we were sick.

375
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:57,820
Trust me, it helps.

376
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,500
I used to have one of these.

377
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:06,500
Used to?
-Yeah.

378
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,100
How come you never wear it?

379
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,720
My mother says we are Jews of discretion.

380
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:12,940
Well,

381
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:16,360
I guess that works for your mother.

382
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:18,720
Funny witch.

383
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,200
Ow you'll fucking kill me if you do that.

384
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,200
Oh, I hope not.

385
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:41,480
Hey, are you leaving?
-Where's Elio?

386
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:44,520
He's inside, he had a bit of a nosebleed
during lunch so he's just resting.

387
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,860
Ah, really?
-Yeah.

388
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:49,540
Okay, I'll be back in a minute.
Don't go anywhere.

389
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:06,460
Traitor.

390
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,040
Traitor.

391
01:09:56,340 --> 01:10:00,180
Please don't avoid me. Kills me.
Can't stand thinking you hate me.

392
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:04,180
Your silence is killing me. I'd sooner die than 
know you hate me. I am such a pussy.

393
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,680
Way over the top.

394
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,200
Can't stand the silence.

395
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:22,920
I need to speak to you.

396
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:47,700
Someone have a good night last night?

397
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:50,440
Hm.

398
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:56,160
Well you must be tired then.

399
01:10:57,020 --> 01:10:58,720
Or were you playing poker too?

400
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,640
I don't play poker.

401
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:06,380
Several hundred colour slides of our boxer and 
the others like them arrived yesterday from Berlin.

402
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:08,840
We should start cataloging them.

403
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,400
That'll keep us busy 'till lunch I imagine.
-Sure.

404
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,040
Oh, beautiful aren't they?

405
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:20,380
But they're all so incredibly sensual.

406
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:24,080
Because these are more Hellenistic
during 5th century Athenian.

407
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,240
Most likely sculpted under the influence of Praxiteles.

408
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,800
"Greatest sculptor in antiquity".

409
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,720
(Oliver) Grow up. I'll see you at midnight.

410
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:14,160
(Elio) Grow up. I'll see you at midnight.

411
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,680
Muscles are firm.
Look at his stomach for example.

412
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:23,540
Not a straight body in these statues,
they're all curved.

413
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:27,620
Sometimes impossibly curved,
and so nonchalant.

414
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:30,600
Hence their ageless ambiguity.

415
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,540
As if they're daring you to desire them.

416
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:56,360
Don't forget, Isaac and Mounir are coming for dinner.

417
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:58,960
Also known as Sonny and Cher.
-Okay.

418
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:03,000
I'd like you to wear that shirt they gave 
you for your birthday.
-No.

419
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:07,420
Darling they bought it from Miami!
-I'm sorry it's too big, it's too big.

420
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:09,380
Come on, it'd make them so happy.
-It looks ridiculous on me.

421
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:13,020
I'll try it on for Oliver. If Oliver thinks I look like 
a scarecrow in it, I'm not wearing it.

422
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:14,260
Oliver?

423
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:17,300
Hey, what time you got?

424
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:19,360
It's two.

425
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:26,340
Well, later.

426
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:27,620
Later.

427
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:40,380
Mafalda.

428
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:43,740
Um, uh,

429
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,420
How are you?
-Hey, I'm good.

430
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:30,100
Good to see you.
-It's great to see you.

431
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:40,100
No, no, I have to go.

432
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:43,680
Have a nice evening.
-Oh, thank you.

433
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:50,540
This right here,

434
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:54,900
is the brand new china that
you guys so kindly sent to us.

435
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:58,340
Oh, it looks wonderful! 
Come here Mounir, Mounir, come, come, come.

436
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:04,420
I can't put it on now they've already met me,
it'll look like a put-up job!
-Yes, you can!

437
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:06,900
Papa! Papa! It'll look like a put-up job!
-Yes-

438
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:09,300
No misbehaving tonight, no- no laughing.

439
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,340
When I tell you to play, you'll play.

440
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:15,100
You- you're too old not to accept people for who they are. 
What's wrong with them?

441
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:18,020
What's wrong with them!
You call them Sonny and Cher behind their back?

442
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:20,220
That's what mom calls them!
-Then you accept gifts from them?

443
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,280
The only person that reflects badly on is you.

444
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,820
Is it because they're gay or because they're ridiculous.

445
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:31,400
You know as much about economics at Mounir's age

446
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,400
you'll be a very wise man indeed.

447
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:36,520
And a- credit to me.

448
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:39,080
Now- now, get into this you.

449
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:50,860
These are, unbelievable, I just uh-

450
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,800
I'm sorry I have to go to bed.
Sorry I'm so tired.

451
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:51,280
Elio. Elio.

452
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,840
Thank you.
-Goodnight.

453
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:56,900
Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

454
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,340
Do I know you?

455
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:12,760
I'm glad you came.

456
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,280
I'm nervous.

457
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,360
Like what you've done with the place.

458
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:09,440
It's nice.

459
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:37,840
You ok?

460
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:44,860
Me ok.

461
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:13,140
Can I kiss you?
-Yes please.

462
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:14,520
What are you doing?

463
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,720
Nothing.

464
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:30,360
This make you happy?

465
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:34,280
You're not gonna get a nosebleed on me, are ya?

466
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:36,080
I'm not gonna get a-

467
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:07,640
Off, off, off, off, off!

468
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:12,660
Just pull it.

469
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:16,360
Or I'll pull it.

470
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:48,720
Oliver.

471
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:32,620
Call me by your name and I'll call you by mine.

472
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:37,420
Elio.

473
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,820
Oliver.

474
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:45,660
Elio.

475
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:48,500
Oliver.

476
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:49,600
Elio.

477
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:04,300
Did we make noise?

478
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:06,300
Nothing to worry about.

479
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,860
I don't know, Mafalda always looks for signs.

480
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:10,920
Well she's not gonna find any.

481
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,900
You wore that shirt the first day you were here.

482
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:23,880
Will you give it to me when you go?

483
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:36,580
Let's go swimming.

484
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:31,760
Are you gonna hold what happened 
last night against me?

485
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:33,640
No.

486
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:43,800
Elio.

487
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:45,500
Come here.

488
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,400
Take your trunks off.

489
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:10,780
Well that's promising. 
-You're hard again.

490
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:11,900
Good.

491
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:58,860
Professor, I got your note. 
Uh, thank you for reminding me.

492
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:00,720
I'm gonna go into town to 
pick up those typed pages today.

493
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:02,720
So maybe this afternoon would 
be a good time to-

494
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:04,740
Later.

495
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:09,360
... before you leave.

496
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:10,100
Okay.

497
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,300
So, later.

498
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:13,560
Later!

499
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:26,600
Oliver!

500
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:39,040
You're not sick of me yet?

501
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:42,000
No, I just- I just wanted to be with you.

502
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:48,120
I'll- I'm gonna- I'll go.

503
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:51,800
Do you know how happy I am 
that we slept together?

504
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:55,160
I don't know.

505
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:58,080
Of course you don't know.

506
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:02,540
I don't want you to regret anything.

507
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:07,040
And I hate the thought that maybe 
I might have messed you up or,

508
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:12,100
I don't want either of us to pay for this.
-No I- it's not like I'm gonna tell anyone you,

509
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:14,920
y- you're not gonna be like in any trouble.

510
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:16,800
That's not what I'm talking about.

511
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:30,200
Are you happy I came here?

512
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:38,900
I'd kiss you if I could.

513
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:51,780
Oh, fuck.

514
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:27,460
Fuck.

515
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:44,040
Fuck.

516
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:44,540
What did you do?

517
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:47,100
Nothing.
-No?

518
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:57,460
Oh, I see.

519
01:38:57,820 --> 01:39:01,700
You've moved onto the plant kingdom already.
What's next, minerals?

520
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:04,500
I suppose you've already given up 
animals, you know that's me.

521
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:07,440
I'm sick, aren't I?

522
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:12,520
I wish everybody was as sick as you.

523
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:16,360
Please don't do that.
-You wanna see something sick?

524
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:18,720
You wanna see something sick?
-Please don't do this.

525
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:20,280
Hey! Please don't do this.

526
01:39:24,940 --> 01:39:26,660
Why are you doing this to me?

527
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:31,420
What are you doing? Stop, you're fucking hurting me.
-Then don't fight.

528
01:39:36,460 --> 01:39:41,280
(ELIO SOBS)

529
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:45,980
Come here.

530
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:55,780
Sorry.

531
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:57,340
It's ok.

532
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:18,520
It's ok.

533
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:21,340
I don't want you to go.

534
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:27,120
God, we wasted so many days.

535
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:29,880
Why didn't you give me a sign?
-I did.

536
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:31,060
You didn't give me a sign.
-I did!

537
01:40:31,060 --> 01:40:32,080
When did- when?

538
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:35,020
You remember when we were playing volleyball?

539
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:37,020
And I touched you

540
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:39,920
just to show you

541
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,340
that I liked you?

542
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:46,280
The way you reacted made me feel like I molested you.
-Sorry, I'm sorry.

543
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:49,240
No, it's fine. I just decided 
I should keep my distance.

544
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:51,980
I don't know.

545
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,400
I come out here for hours almost every night.

546
01:41:00,540 --> 01:41:01,640
I didn't know that.

547
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:06,040
That's funny, I-

548
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:08,080
I thought that...

549
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:11,240
Yeah I know what you thought.
-Stop, stop.

550
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:54,060
For Oliver, from Elio.

551
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:05,160
Elio?

552
01:42:24,020 --> 01:42:25,300
I had to work.

553
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:32,800
Yeah, I don't know, I just uh-

554
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:48,140
I'm- I'm not your girl?

555
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:13,600
Oliver has to go to Bergamo for a few days.

556
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:14,580
Oh?

557
01:43:14,900 --> 01:43:16,800
Research at the university.

558
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:19,880
Then he'll fly home from Linate.

559
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,140
Oh but what about Elio?

560
01:43:25,580 --> 01:43:28,080
Maybe it could be nice for the two of them

561
01:43:28,340 --> 01:43:30,400
to get away for a couple of days, no?

562
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:35,880
What do you think?

563
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:40,680
... our favourite student.

564
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:42,680
You must come back.
-You sure you're not just saying that?

565
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:44,740
Oliver.
-Thank you very much, professor.

566
01:43:46,660 --> 01:43:48,020
Oh, man.

567
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:53,740
Please, please, come back soon.
-Come back? I'm just going home to pack. I'm living here!

568
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000
You're welcome!

569
01:43:57,460 --> 01:43:58,480
Oh, well.

570
01:43:59,410 --> 01:44:01,300
Thank you guys so much.
-Ah, of course.

571
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:02,690
Oliver, Oliver.

572
01:44:03,860 --> 01:44:04,700
Come back.

573
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:09,180
Come here, come here. It's been amazing. Thank you guys.
-Oh, oh.

574
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:10,770
Well,

575
01:44:11,530 --> 01:44:12,370
later Perlmans.

576
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:15,000
Later! Later, later, later!

577
01:44:25,020 --> 01:44:27,140
Tell Elio to call when you get there!

578
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:32,330
Oh no!

579
01:45:03,370 --> 01:45:04,130
What?

580
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:05,540
Nothing.
-What!

581
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:06,380
Nothing.

582
01:45:34,410 --> 01:45:35,500
Yes!

583
01:45:36,010 --> 01:45:36,900
Woo!

584
01:45:39,210 --> 01:45:40,370
Oliver!

585
01:45:40,970 --> 01:45:42,460
Elio!

586
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:44,690
Elio!

587
01:45:56,420 --> 01:45:58,410
Woo!

588
01:45:58,410 --> 01:46:01,800
Oliver!
-Elio!

589
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:06,240
Woo!

590
01:48:07,100 --> 01:48:07,890
You hear that?

591
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:11,060
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

592
01:48:13,730 --> 01:48:16,180
No, no, no! It's this- 
it's this way come on!

593
01:48:16,300 --> 01:48:17,610
You're missing it!

594
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:19,480
Come on!

595
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:22,540
Woo!

596
01:49:24,570 --> 01:49:25,800
What'd she say?

597
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:25,640
Did you get your passport?

598
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:27,200
Fuck.

599
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,060
How are you?

600
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:00,610
Good.

601
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:01,760
Missed you at dinner.

602
01:57:25,860 --> 01:57:26,940
So?

603
01:57:29,130 --> 01:57:30,290
Welcome home.

604
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:31,420
Thanks.

605
01:57:33,130 --> 01:57:35,290
Oliver enjoy the trip?
-Yeah.

606
01:57:35,930 --> 01:57:36,900
Think he did.

607
01:57:38,450 --> 01:57:40,050
You two had a nice friendship.

608
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:43,090
Yeah.

609
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:52,500
You're too smart not to know how rare,

610
01:57:54,730 --> 01:57:57,640
how special, what you two had was.

611
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,560
Oliver was Oliver.
-Mm.

612
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:13,540
Oliver may be very intelligent but-
-Oh, no, no.

613
01:58:13,540 --> 01:58:15,260
He was more than intelligent.

614
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:18,740
What you two had,

615
01:58:20,380 --> 01:58:23,340
had everything and nothing to do with intelligence.

616
01:58:24,010 --> 01:58:25,060
He was good.

617
01:58:27,340 --> 01:58:30,300
You were both lucky to have 
found each other because...

618
01:58:31,420 --> 01:58:33,200
You too are good.

619
01:58:40,020 --> 01:58:42,200
I think he was better than me.

620
01:58:48,500 --> 01:58:50,770
I'm sure he'd say the same thing about you.

621
01:58:51,090 --> 01:58:52,770
Yeah, he'd say the same thing.

622
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:55,000
Which flatters you both.

623
01:58:58,980 --> 01:59:00,580
When you least expect it,

624
01:59:02,460 --> 01:59:06,100
nature has cunning ways of finding our weakest spot.

625
01:59:08,700 --> 01:59:09,640
Just...

626
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:12,320
remember I'm here.

627
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:22,340
Right now you may not want to feel anything.

628
01:59:23,660 --> 01:59:25,960
Maybe you never wanted to feel anything.

629
01:59:27,120 --> 01:59:28,090
And uh,

630
01:59:29,450 --> 01:59:32,980
maybe it's not me you want to speak about these things but uh,

631
01:59:34,900 --> 01:59:37,570
feel something you obviously did.

632
01:59:41,740 --> 01:59:43,980
Look, you had a beautiful friendship,

633
01:59:45,650 --> 01:59:47,220
maybe more than a friendship.

634
01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:49,940
And I envy you.

635
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:56,690
My place, most parents would hope the whole thing goes away.

636
01:59:57,330 --> 01:59:59,760
Pray their sons land on their feet, but...

637
02:00:02,120 --> 02:00:03,820
I am not such a parent.

638
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:10,620
We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster,

639
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:14,010
that we go bankrupt by the age of 30,

640
02:00:15,540 --> 02:00:18,760
and have less to offer each time we start with someone new.

641
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:23,220
But to make yourself feel nothing,

642
02:00:24,170 --> 02:00:25,840
so as not to feel anything,

643
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:29,000
what a waste.

644
02:00:36,980 --> 02:00:38,440
Have I spoke enough?

645
02:00:43,320 --> 02:00:44,960
Then I'll say one more thing.

646
02:00:48,580 --> 02:00:49,890
It'll clear the air.

647
02:00:52,770 --> 02:00:54,410
I may have come close,

648
02:00:55,740 --> 02:00:57,650
but I never had what you two have.

649
02:01:00,240 --> 02:01:01,760
Something always...

650
02:01:02,820 --> 02:01:03,840
held me back,

651
02:01:04,970 --> 02:01:06,650
or stood in the way.

652
02:01:11,700 --> 02:01:13,880
How you live your life is your business.

653
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:14,680
Just...

654
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:16,680
remember.

655
02:01:18,770 --> 02:01:22,100
Our hearts in our bodies are given to us only once,

656
02:01:23,050 --> 02:01:23,970
and...

657
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:26,850
before you know it,

658
02:01:26,850 --> 02:01:28,220
your heart's worn out.

659
02:01:28,660 --> 02:01:30,810
And as for your body?

660
02:01:31,250 --> 02:01:33,380
There comes a point where no one looks at it.

661
02:01:35,050 --> 02:01:36,920
Much less wants to come near it.

662
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:41,450
Right now,

663
02:01:42,040 --> 02:01:43,980
there's sorrow...

664
02:01:45,490 --> 02:01:46,490
pain...

665
02:01:46,490 --> 02:01:48,490
don't kill it.

666
02:01:50,120 --> 02:01:52,570
And with it, the joy you felt.

667
02:02:04,890 --> 02:02:06,140
Does mom know?

668
02:02:12,120 --> 02:02:13,400
I don't think she does.

669
02:04:14,640 --> 02:04:15,770
I'll get it!

670
02:04:20,820 --> 02:04:22,800
(Elio? You there?)

671
02:04:23,690 --> 02:04:24,500
Hi!

672
02:04:25,170 --> 02:04:26,050
(Hey!)

673
02:04:26,330 --> 02:04:27,480
How are you?

674
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:29,960
(I'm good, I'm good. How are you?)

675
02:04:29,960 --> 02:04:31,960
I'm good! They're fine.
-(How are your parents?)

676
02:04:32,240 --> 02:04:32,820
(Good.)

677
02:04:35,210 --> 02:04:36,400
I missed you.

678
02:04:37,620 --> 02:04:38,920
(I missed you, too.)

679
02:04:40,160 --> 02:04:41,160
(Very much.)

680
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:46,480
(I have some news.)

681
02:04:46,690 --> 02:04:48,210
N- news?

682
02:04:50,930 --> 02:04:52,700
Oh, you're getting married?

683
02:04:53,050 --> 02:04:54,210
I suppose..?

684
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:59,450
(I might be getting married next spring, yeah.)

685
02:05:02,690 --> 02:05:04,370
You never said anything.

686
02:05:06,370 --> 02:05:08,930
(It's been off and on for two years.)

687
02:05:12,660 --> 02:05:14,080
That's wonderful news.

688
02:05:16,140 --> 02:05:17,060
(Do you mind?)

689
02:05:24,640 --> 02:05:27,970
Oliver! Oliver!
-(Hey, hey, hey!)

690
02:05:27,970 --> 02:05:29,810
Oh darling when are you coming back?

691
02:05:29,960 --> 02:05:31,360
(Oh, I wish I was.)

692
02:05:31,490 --> 02:05:35,170
You caught us in the process of choosing the new you for next summer.

693
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:38,000
And guess what? He's a she!
-(Oh, nice!)

694
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,690
Well speaking of she's, 
I'm calling to tell you guys I got engaged!

695
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:44,650
Oh, wonderful!

696
02:05:44,650 --> 02:05:46,650
Congratulations!
-Mazel tov!

697
02:05:46,650 --> 02:05:48,650
Congratulations, Oliver!
-(Thank you, thank you.)

698
02:05:49,050 --> 02:05:50,650
Listen, w-we'll leave you-

699
02:05:50,650 --> 02:05:52,440
we'll- we'll let you speak to Elio.

700
02:05:52,440 --> 02:05:54,440
Happy Hanukkah!

701
02:05:54,440 --> 02:05:55,370
Bye, sweetheart.

702
02:06:03,570 --> 02:06:05,000
They know about us.

703
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:07,600
I figured.

704
02:06:10,180 --> 02:06:10,970
How?

705
02:06:12,860 --> 02:06:15,140
Well, from the way your dad spoke to me.

706
02:06:16,250 --> 02:06:18,560
He made me feel like I was a part of the family.

707
02:06:18,770 --> 02:06:20,360
Almost like a son-in-law.

708
02:06:22,330 --> 02:06:23,490
You're so lucky.

709
02:06:24,970 --> 02:06:27,850
My father would have carted me off to a correctional facility.

710
02:06:30,370 --> 02:06:31,360
Elio?

711
02:06:35,130 --> 02:06:39,200
Elio, Elio, Elio, Elio, Elio, Elio, Elio, Elio.

712
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:44,410
Oliver.

713
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:49,000
I remember everything.

714
02:10:53,730 --> 02:10:55,100
Elio.

715
02:10:57,320 --> 02:10:58,730
Elio?

716
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:08,020
im gay and sad thanks for coming to my ted talk
