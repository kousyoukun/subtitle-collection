1
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,171
The usurper.

2
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,332
He seems very confident.

3
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,089
Where's Elio?

4
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,632
I'll go down.

5
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,485
Darling, come help Oliver
take his things up to his room.

6
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,987
- He's already here?
- Yes!

7
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,934
You're leaving?

8
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,023
Nice to meet you.

9
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,442
I'll take care of the tart.

10
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,440
Let me do it.

11
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,417
Thank you.

12
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,549
Peaches, cherries, apricots...

13
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,335
Help yourself, darling.

14
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,711
Thanks.

15
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,240
- Ciao, Romano.
- Ciao, Oliver.

16
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,909
- How are you?
- All good.

17
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,708
Ciao, boys!

18
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,626
All good?

19
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,378
All good!

20
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,883
- Can you start please?
- Of course!

21
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,821
Good morning, gentlemen.

22
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,875
Go, Chiara!

23
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,220
He's better than the guy
who came last year.

24
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,679
Remember?

25
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,598
Get in there!

26
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,559
Much better!
See how cute he is.

27
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,781
Elio, water!

28
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:04,379
Sweetheart, Auntie Marcella and
the others are coming over for dinner.

29
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,883
Is Oliver staying with us or going out?

30
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,301
Don't know.

31
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,678
What a movie star!

32
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,473
Yes, those Americans...

33
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,706
Sparkling wine!

34
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,042
He's late.

35
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,711
Don't you think...

36
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,715
Don't you think he's impolite
when he says, "Later"?

37
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,510
Arrogant.

38
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,656
Oh, no, sweetheart.

39
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,452
- Take his plates away.
- Very well, madam.

40
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,439
I don't want to.

41
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,483
Why not?

42
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,026
Because I don't want to.

43
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,445
Why don't you go
to Moscazzano with others?

44
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,239
Because I don't want to.

45
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,585
Play well, darling.

46
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,770
Have you been to the river?

47
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,453
Mafalda!

48
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,371
Isn't she beautiful?

49
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,529
Come here.

50
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,283
What's going on?

51
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,160
Is he trying to get it on with her?

52
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,412
Elio, he already succeeded?

53
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,748
What do I know?

54
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,500
I'd love to be in his shoes.

55
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,502
Who wouldn't love to be in her shoes?

56
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,215
She wants him, no matter what!

57
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:41,636
Coming?

58
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,306
I'll come later.

59
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:03,592
Are you with me because
you're mad at Chiara?

60
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,344
Why would I be mad at Chiara?

61
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,055
Because of him.

62
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,598
Because of who?

63
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,018
Of Oliver.

64
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,905
Turn around.

65
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,380
Meet me here tomorrow night?

66
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,556
Wait for me!

67
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,183
Come on.

68
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,172
What are you doing?

69
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,216
Going to Lake Garda with my dad.

70
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,301
He wants to show Oliver
where he's dredging.

71
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,637
Can you tell him I came by?

72
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,473
He's inside with my dad, helping him.

73
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,728
You were amazing last night,
on the dance floor.

74
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,689
- He's a good dancer.
- A good dancer.

75
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,734
He's good-looking too.

76
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,988
- Want to get us together?
- No.

77
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,408
Come in.

78
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,939
I'll drive today!

79
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:56,617
Anchise, take the afternoon off.

80
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,517
Sammy! Come on!

81
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,032
Truce?

82
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:31,034
Sorry, Elio.
I brought some clean clothes.

83
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,583
Leave the door open.

84
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,377
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

85
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,615
Come here, darling.

86
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,139
I straightened the wheels
and inflated the tires.

87
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:09,641
Perfect. Thanks.

88
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,353
Let's go, American!

89
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,678
Good morning, ma'am.

90
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,556
Excuse me.

91
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:27,185
Could I ask for a glass of water?

92
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,074
"People of Italy!"

93
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,082
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

94
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:46,379
So we got the government
of Bettino Craxi...

95
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:49,006
Because we don't do anything
but talk, talk, talk.

96
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,008
Let me speak.

97
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:54,637
We have five parties
that do nothing but fight.

98
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,473
Smoke and shut up!
Let them speak, him, her.

99
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:00,476
I'd like to know what they think too.

100
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:03,396
Annella, what do you think?
A five party government!

101
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:06,691
Darling, I think
it's the historic compromise...

102
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:10,861
Don't say that. Compromises are tragic.

103
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:13,739
You've changed
since you inherited this place.

104
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,533
What's that got to do with it?

105
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,410
What are you saying?

106
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,787
You're mad, darling.

107
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:21,831
You asshole!

108
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:25,793
- She's right.
- And you don't say anything to her.

109
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,546
Say something.

110
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:30,339
You're resigned.

111
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:33,009
Why don't we talk
about the death of Buñuel?

112
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:36,137
Buñuel was a genius.

113
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,847
- Know him?
- Cinema isn't the answer.

114
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:41,225
Cinema is a mirror of reality
and it's a filter.

115
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:45,021
They broadcast The Phantom of Liberty
with constant interr...

116
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:47,606
Everyone loves Buñuel!

117
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,275
Let's hear his opinion.

118
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,819
He doesn't know anything about Italy!

119
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,863
Say something. Give us your impression.

120
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:55,531
Do you have an impression?

121
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,700
Darling, he's American.

122
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:59,160
That doesn't mean stupid!

123
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:07,209
Just stop.

124
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:11,213
I don't give an easy ride
to some politicians.

125
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:14,175
She didn't say that.

126
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,177
I'm going to go mad.

127
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:18,137
What's the matter?

128
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,140
What's wrong?

129
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,267
It's nothing. It happens all the time.

130
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:26,562
- Mafalda, ice?
- It's in the fridge.

131
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:29,315
You get used to absolutely everything.

132
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:08,854
Don't you realize
you're mixing everything up?

133
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,606
What are you talking about?

134
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:13,484
There's no more politics, nothing.
He's left too.

135
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:03,844
You okay?

136
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:12,978
Are we going out?

137
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:18,275
I don't know if I can go out.
If my mom sees, she'll worry.

138
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,486
- She will?
- Yeah, she's a pain.

139
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:27,368
Where's Oliver?

140
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:29,036
Don't ask me.

141
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:47,972
Where's Oliver?

142
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:51,684
- Didn't he go out?
- Would you like a smoothie?

143
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:54,395
No, thank you. We're having dinner soon.

144
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:55,813
All right.

145
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:57,189
I'm going out tonight.

146
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:00,609
- Don't make me worry.
- What are you talking about?

147
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:02,403
This is no good, madam.

148
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:04,613
- Let him do his own thing.
- Fine.

149
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,740
Why's she hassling me? I'm 17.

150
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,450
She's worried about you.

151
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:15,749
You like him, don't you? Oliver?

152
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,585
Everyone likes Oliver.

153
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,088
I think he likes you too.

154
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:22,464
More than you do.

155
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:26,969
Is that your impression?

156
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:29,930
- No, he told me.
- When did he say that?

157
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,308
A while ago.

158
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,084
Mafalda, do you know where Oliver is?

159
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:00,669
I have no idea.

160
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:37,367
This is Craxi.
I draw the center of Craxi...

161
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,885
- Hey.
- Hi!

162
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,680
It's me. Is that Marzia?

163
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:00,599
Sure it is! Can't you tell?

164
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:01,725
Sorry.

165
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,080
Is that for me?

166
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:25,749
Thanks.

167
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:44,643
Do you really read a lot?

168
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:47,479
I love reading too,
but I don't tell anyone.

169
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:49,731
Why not?

170
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:51,149
I don't know.

171
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,570
I think...

172
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,614
people who read are...

173
01:07:58,241 --> 01:07:59,366
kind of secretive.

174
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:03,203
They hide who they really are.

175
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:06,415
Do you hide who you really are?

176
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,750
No, not with you.

177
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,002
Not with me?

178
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:16,258
Well, maybe a bit.

179
01:08:16,384 --> 01:08:17,801
What do you mean?

180
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:21,471
You know exactly what I mean.

181
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:23,265
Why do you say that?

182
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,017
Why?

183
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:28,520
Because...

184
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:30,814
I think...

185
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,899
you're going to hurt me,

186
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,776
and I don't want to be hurt.

187
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:53,545
You're so hard.

188
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,303
Wait.

189
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:02,804
Kiss me.

190
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:11,897
- Is that good?
- Yes.

191
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,399
Are you lying?

192
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:28,580
- Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

193
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:30,874
Are you mad at me? Are you angry?

194
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:44,096
What's so funny? Why are you laughing?

195
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,431
Leave me alone.

196
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:49,267
Fuck, that felt good.

197
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:50,662
Not really.

198
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:46,338
I won't be here for dinner.

199
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,173
Okay, Mr. Oliver.

200
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:21,790
Hello, Mafalda.

201
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:22,916
Marzia.

202
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:27,337
Where are we going?

203
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:28,672
You'll see.

204
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:44,896
Stop it!

205
01:17:21,011 --> 01:17:22,971
- How are you, buddy?
- Hey!

206
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:25,056
- It's been ages.
- It has, yes.

207
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:27,600
- How are you?
- You've grown.

208
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:32,522
Remember Marzia from last year.

209
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:33,690
Hello.

210
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:36,109
- Marzia, remember Isaac?
- The girl from Paris?

211
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:37,569
Good to meet you.

212
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:39,154
Want to eat with us tonight?

213
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:42,323
- You're sure?
- Yes.

214
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:45,618
Goodbye.

215
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:52,918
Times change.

216
01:33:53,086 --> 01:33:54,795
Thank God we had the partisans.

217
01:33:54,963 --> 01:33:59,049
I know, but times have changed.
It's different.

218
01:33:59,175 --> 01:34:01,218
What do you think of Bettino?

219
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:04,221
- I don't like him.
- I like him.

220
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:06,765
I'm happy, actually.

221
01:34:09,769 --> 01:34:11,812
I don't know. We'll see.

222
01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:16,817
Anyway, they make the rules.

223
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:22,030
Pasquina!

224
01:34:22,115 --> 01:34:23,365
Hello.

225
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:24,825
Hello, ma'am.

226
01:34:25,785 --> 01:34:27,870
- Tortelli cremaschi.
- Yes.

227
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:20,008
You disappeared for three days.

228
01:42:27,475 --> 01:42:29,768
You completely disappeared.

229
01:42:36,025 --> 01:42:37,567
I had a lot to do.

230
01:44:49,825 --> 01:44:51,951
Come for dinner tonight.

231
01:44:52,036 --> 01:44:53,286
Bring Marzia.

232
01:44:54,872 --> 01:44:56,122
Bye, darling.

233
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:47,770
If you'll excuse me...

234
01:48:47,896 --> 01:48:49,897
Just one second.

235
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:52,233
One second!

236
01:49:11,837 --> 01:49:13,838
I saw them last year.

237
01:49:14,673 --> 01:49:17,175
Richard Butler... fantastic!

238
01:49:17,342 --> 01:49:21,012
Really? We saw them in concert too.

239
01:49:21,096 --> 01:49:23,931
We hitchhiked to London.

240
01:53:49,323 --> 01:53:50,531
Mafalda?

241
01:53:51,533 --> 01:53:52,658
Mom?

242
01:53:53,785 --> 01:53:55,202
Yeah, it's me.

243
01:53:56,538 --> 01:53:58,914
Yeah, everything is fine.
I'm at the station...

244
01:53:59,624 --> 01:54:00,958
in Clusone.

245
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:04,545
Listen, Mom, can you...

246
01:54:06,173 --> 01:54:08,132
Can you come get me, Mom?

247
01:55:06,858 --> 01:55:09,110
I read the book you bought me.

248
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:11,529
The poems...

249
01:55:11,655 --> 01:55:13,155
They're really beautiful.

250
01:55:13,281 --> 01:55:16,325
I love that... Antonia Pozzi.

251
01:55:19,496 --> 01:55:21,497
I'm sorry, excuse me...

252
01:55:21,623 --> 01:55:23,332
that you're sad.

253
01:55:24,626 --> 01:55:27,545
I'm saying that because
I wanted to tell you

254
01:55:27,671 --> 01:55:29,338
I'm not mad at you.

255
01:55:30,924 --> 01:55:32,258
Not at all.

256
01:55:39,891 --> 01:55:41,183
I love you, Elio.

257
01:55:46,606 --> 01:55:47,940
Stay friends?

258
01:55:49,985 --> 01:55:51,318
For life?

259
01:55:52,112 --> 01:55:53,404
For life?

260
01:58:06,371 --> 01:58:08,289
Because it was him.

261
01:58:09,457 --> 01:58:11,292
Because it was me.

262
02:03:19,309 --> 02:03:21,894
- Have you been to the Gaverine?
- Yes.

263
02:03:31,821 --> 02:03:33,488
- May I?
- Happy Hanukkah!

264
02:03:33,615 --> 02:03:34,698
To you too.

265
02:04:20,662 --> 02:04:21,662
Hello?
