633
01:48:33,388 --> 01:48:36,915
All you have to do is smile
and say "thankyou."

634
01:48:38,326 --> 01:48:40,351
Then we'll take you over
to see Kelly.

635
01:48:43,064 --> 01:48:44,998
She's actually gonna
be there, huh ?

636
01:48:46,367 --> 01:48:48,562
Well, that's what
we have arranged.

637
01:48:48,803 --> 01:48:50,430
I mean, ifyou're sure
you wanna do that.

Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yes.

639
01:48:56,945 --> 01:48:59,038
I don't know what
I'm gonna say to her.

640
01:49:00,515 --> 01:49:02,813
What in the world
am I gonna say to her ?

641
01:49:06,888 --> 01:49:10,051
Chuck, Kelly had
to let you go.

And we buriedyou.

645
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:23,059
We had a funeral and a coffi n
and a gravestone.

646
01:49:23,171 --> 01:49:25,105
The whole thing.

647
01:49:26,341 --> 01:49:28,241
You had a coffin ?

648
01:49:31,045 --> 01:49:32,979
What was in it ?

649
01:49:34,215 --> 01:49:37,013
Well, everybody put
something in.

650
01:49:37,085 --> 01:49:41,852
You know, just a cell phone
or a beeper, some pictures.

Iputinsome Elvis CDs.

652
01:49:46,995 --> 01:49:48,895
So you had my funeral...

653
01:49:51,332 --> 01:49:53,960
and then you had
Mary's funeral.

654
01:49:58,873 --> 01:50:02,365
Stan, I'm so sorry
I wasn't around when Mary died.

I should've been there foryou,
and I wasn't.

I'm so sorry.

657
01:50:15,089 --> 01:50:17,489
Fouryears ago,

658
01:50:17,592 --> 01:50:21,551
the FedEx family lost
five ofour sons.

659

That was a terrible
and tragic day.

But today,
one ofthose sons,

has been returned to us.

andnow they're the Titans.

But that's not all.

- You would've died. It was so exciting.

When your plane went down,

747
02:00:09,149 --> 02:00:11,481
everything just sort of
got put on hold.

taking it up again, though.

from whenyou went down to now.

They said they never figured out
what caused the crash.

758
02:01:11,145 --> 02:01:14,774
Probably some mislabeled
hazardous material caught fire.

759
02:01:19,086 --> 02:01:21,350
So here's where
that ship found you.

760
02:01:22,790 --> 02:01:25,918
You drifted about 500 miles.

761

This is where
your island was,

762

about 600 miles
south ofthe Cook lslands.

763

And these are
the search grids.

764
02:01:35,636 --> 02:01:38,366
Ships went back and forth
for weeks looking foryou.

765
02:01:47,615 --> 02:01:49,640
I never should've
gotten on that plane.

766
02:01:51,952 --> 02:01:54,352
I never should've
gotten out ofthe car.

All right, now,
this is weird.

It's a good car.

773
02:02:36,296 --> 02:02:38,696

in this car.

down to the Gulf, yeah.

02:02:46,073 --> 02:02:47,973
So, can I drive it ?

the only thing
I could control...

was when and how...

and where
that was gonna happen.

820

So... I made a rope.

And I went up to the summit
to hang myself.

I couldn't even kill myself
the way I wanted to.

I had power over nothing.

And that's when this feeling
came over me like a warm blanket.

even though there was
no reason to hope.

836
02:10:37,811 --> 02:10:41,542
And all my logic said that
I would never see this place again.
