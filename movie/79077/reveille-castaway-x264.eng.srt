I was gonna die there,

814
02:08:57,770 --> 02:08:59,670
totally alone.

815
02:09:06,050 --> 02:09:08,910
I mean,I was gonna get sick or I was gonna get injured or something.

816
02:09:13,050 --> 02:09:14,990
The only choice I had,

817
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:19,950
the only thing I could control...

818
02:09:22,060 --> 02:09:25,590
was when and how...

819
02:09:25,700 --> 02:09:27,600
and where that was gonna happen.

820
02:09:27,700 --> 02:09:32,070
So... I made a rope.

821
02:09:35,140 --> 02:09:38,040
And I went up to the summit to hang myself.

822
02:09:41,720 --> 02:09:43,780
But I had to test it, you know ?

823
02:09:43,890 --> 02:09:46,790
Ofcourse. You know me.

824
02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:50,690
And the weight ofthe log...

825
02:09:50,760 --> 02:09:53,990
snapped the limb ofthe tree.

826
02:09:54,100 --> 02:09:56,030
So l-l--

827
02:09:56,100 --> 02:09:58,760
I couldn't even kill myself the way I wanted to.

828
02:09:58,870 --> 02:10:01,770
I had power over nothing.

829
02:10:10,210 --> 02:10:13,810
And that's when this feeling came over me like a warm blanket.

830
02:10:17,890 --> 02:10:19,880
I knew...

831
02:10:19,990 --> 02:10:22,220
somehow...

832
02:10:22,290 --> 02:10:24,720
that I had to stay alive.

833
02:10:26,260 --> 02:10:28,160
Somehow.

834
02:10:29,260 --> 02:10:31,630
I had to keep breathing,

835
02:10:34,140 --> 02:10:36,160
even though there was no reason to hope.

836
02:10:38,310 --> 02:10:42,040
And all my logic said that I would never see this place again.

837
02:10:46,950 --> 02:10:49,780
So that's what I did.

838
02:10:49,850 --> 02:10:52,290
I stayed alive.

839
02:10:52,390 --> 02:10:54,320
I kept breathing.

840
02:10:56,690 --> 02:10:58,890
And then one day that logic was proven all wrong,

841
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:00,890
because the tide...

842
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,430
came in, gave me a sail.

843
02:11:10,170 --> 02:11:12,110
And now,here I am.

844
02:11:15,410 --> 02:11:18,350
I'm back...

845
02:11:18,450 --> 02:11:21,010
in Memphis,talking to you.

846
02:11:23,150 --> 02:11:25,710
I have ice in my glass.

847
02:11:32,330 --> 02:11:34,790
And I've lost her all over again.

848
02:11:42,670 --> 02:11:45,000
I'm so sad that I don't have Kelly.

849
02:11:50,140 --> 02:11:53,440
But I'm so grateful that she was with me on that island.

850
02:12:00,790 --> 02:12:02,850
And I know what I have to do now.

851
02:12:05,830 --> 02:12:07,850
I gotta keep breathing.

852
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:12,960
Because tomorrow, the sun will rise.

853
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:16,730
Who knows what the tide could bring ?
