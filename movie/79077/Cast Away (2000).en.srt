1
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,870
Mrs Peterson!

2
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:43,498
Ramon, hey! How's it going?

3
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,083
How you doing?

4
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:48,086
There it is, there on the desk.

5
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,879
Where's she headed?

6
00:02:49,963 --> 00:02:51,589
She's snowbound, Ramon.

7
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,095
See you went with the pink.

8
00:02:57,178 --> 00:03:00,473
Yeah, yeah. It's kind of a pink day today.

9
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:03,518
I'll have another pickup for you on Thursday.

10
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:06,187
- All right. See you then.
- All right. Thanks.

11
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:43,558
Peterson! Peterson!

12
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:45,852
Peterson.

13
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,941
- Mr Cowboy, <i>da?
- Da.</i>

14
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:58,656
It's pretty.

15
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:03,411
It's from my wife.

16
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,898
Time rules over us without mercy,

17
00:05:13,982 --> 00:05:17,902
not caring if we're healthy or ill, hungry or drunk,

18
00:05:17,986 --> 00:05:21,364
Russian, American, beings from Mars.

19
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:24,659
It's like a fire. It could either destroy us
or keep us warm.

20
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:27,245
That's why every FedEx office has a clock.

21
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:30,081
Because we live or we die by the clock.

22
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,916
We never turn our back on it.

23
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,088
And we never, ever allow ourselves
the sin of losing track of time!

24
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:39,924
Locally, it's 1:56.

25
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:43,803
That means we've got three hours and four minutes

26
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,722
before the end-of-the-day's
package sort.

27
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:49,350
That's how long we have.
That's how much time we have

28
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:53,104
before this pulsating, accursed, relentless taskmaster

29
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:55,606
tries to put us out of business.

30
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:59,027
Hey, Nicolai. Good to see you.

31
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,778
How are you, kid?

32
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:03,197
You just delivered your very first FedEx package.

33
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:05,366
That deserves something special,

34
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:09,287
like a Snickers bar and a CD player.

35
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:12,874
And something to listen to.
There. Elvis Presley.

36
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:14,709
Fifty million fans can't be wrong.

37
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,627
You all recognise this, don't you?

38
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:19,547
I took the liberty of sending this to myself.

39
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:24,135
I FedEx'd it before I left Memphis.

40
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:26,763
You're probably wondering what could be in here.

41
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:30,933
Is it architectural plans?
Maybe technical drawings?

42
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:34,520
Is this the new wallpaper for the bathroom?

43
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:38,691
It is a clock,

44
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,568
which I started at absolute zero,

45
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:44,864
and is now at 87 hours, 22 minutes and 17 seconds.

46
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:50,161
From Memphis, America, to Nicolai in Russia, 87 hours.

47
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:54,373
Eighty-seven hours
is a shameful outrage.

48
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:56,834
This is just an egg timer!

49
00:06:57,335 --> 00:07:00,254
What if it had been something else?
Like your paycheque?

50
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:03,341
Or fresh boysenberries?
Or adoption papers?

51
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,384
Eighty-seven hours is an eternity.

52
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:07,512
The cosmos was created in less time!

53
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:10,431
Wars have been fought and nations toppled in 87 hours!

54
00:07:10,515 --> 00:07:12,850
Fortunes made and squandered.

55
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:20,358
What? What are you saying about me?

56
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:21,943
I tell them, what do they expect?

57
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:26,280
This man, when his truck broke down,
he stole a boy's bicycle.

58
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:29,075
I borrowed it! I borrowed a kid's bike.

59
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:32,620
I got my packages delivered,
and that is what you have to do.

60
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:33,955
You have to do whatever it takes,

61
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:36,040
because in three hours and two minutes

62
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:39,418
every one of these packages has to be on the big truck,

63
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:41,170
on its way to the airport.

64
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:43,798
Fifteen minutes!

65
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:47,051
- Crunch time! Crunch time!
- Crunch time!

66
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:50,471
Let's go! Every package
on the airport truck.

67
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:52,723
Go! Crunch, crunch, crunch!

68
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:54,559
- We have a big problem.
- What?

69
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:57,436
- The truck in Red Square is stuck.
- What?

70
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,148
- It's stuck.
- Stuck how? In snow? In ice?

71
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:03,734
The most important truck,
the Kremlin truck! Many packages.

72
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:18,166
All right. Let's put the table right here.
We'll just do the sort.

73
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:21,002
Yeah, a clamp.
That would make us stuck.

74
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,838
Let's go. Unload... Get him out of there.

75
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:26,674
Right here. Two lines, two lines.

76
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:29,594
One to the airport truck, one to the Moscow truck.

77
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:30,887
Got it?

78
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:34,140
CDG, FE, ME, Memphis on the airport truck.

79
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:37,602
Everything else there. Nicolai!
Tick-tock, tick-tock. Four minutes.

80
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,815
<i>Hi, this is Kelly.
If you're calling for Chuck, press one.</i>

81
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,401
<i>Otherwise, leave a message. Thanks.</i>

82
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,988
<i>Kelly. Are you there?
Pick up, pick up, pick up.</i>

83
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:51,032
<i>You're not there.</i>

84
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:55,411
<i>I'm doing the sorts in Red Square,
in the shadow of Lenin's tomb.</i>

85
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:56,746
<i>I miss you.</i>

86
00:08:56,871 --> 00:08:58,873
I miss you, I really wanna kiss you.

87
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,834
I'm picking up the sweep through Paris.

88
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:04,462
I should be back in Memphis in about 18 hours.

89
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:05,838
That's the good news.

90
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:08,674
The bad news is... I gotta go to the dentist this week.

91
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:10,218
I got something that's hurting.

92
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:13,554
I'll see you soon, and you know what that means.

93
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:16,307
Bye-bye. Nicolai!
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock!

94
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,870
I absolutely, positively have to get to Memphis tonight.

95
00:09:37,954 --> 00:09:39,914
Can't help you. Try UPS.

96
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,959
Will we be able to push it and make the sort?

97
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:45,086
- We'll do our best.
- "Our best"?

98
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:49,131
Gwen, what's wrong with our doctors
that Jack is certified to fly?

99
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:51,133
Aren't you concerned?

100
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:53,803
Terrified, but a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do.

101
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:56,931
That's the spirit. Relentless is our goal.

102
00:09:57,014 --> 00:10:01,394
What do you expect from the guy
who stole a crippled kid's bicycle?

103
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:04,855
I borrowed it.
But I love that the kid's now crippled.

104
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:07,441
So you missed the last truck by two minutes?

105
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:10,027
Two minutes. Actually, it was less.

106
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:13,572
The plane wasn't heavy.
You could've added some fuel

107
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:15,825
and picked up speed.

108
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:18,703
It's about the trucks.
Today's truck was two minutes late.

109
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:21,747
Tomorrow's will be four minutes late, then six, eight.

110
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:24,500
Next thing you know, we're the US Mail.

111
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,961
Well, all I'm saying is,

112
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:28,421
if you'd gotten all those trucks on the plane,

113
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:31,257
those Russkies would be walking on water now.

114
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:35,052
Hey, don't give me that look.
It's just grape juice.

115
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:36,429
- Right, Chuck?
- Yeah.

116
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:39,390
Yeah. It's like
a 1992 full-bodied grape juice.

117
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,767
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.

118
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:44,979
We'd offer you some, but somebody's got to fly the plane.

119
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:47,565
Yeah, well, I "just say no," right?

120
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:52,737
Listen, Stan, I've been meaning to ask you, how's Mary?

121
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,449
Well...

122
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:59,744
We really don't know anything yet.

123
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:03,831
She went to the doctor yesterday, and...

124
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,753
It hasn't metastasized

125
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,756
as far as they can tell right now.

126
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,925
It's just kind of wait and see.

127
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:16,761
I'm so sorry.

128
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:20,806
Tell her I'm gonna come by
and see her on my next layover.

129
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,226
I want you to know, Stan,
we are all thinking about her and you,

130
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,271
- and just blessings.
- Thank you, Gwen.

131
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:29,482
<i>Hi, this is Kelly.
If you're calling for Chuck, press one.</i>

132
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:32,234
<i>Otherwise, leave a message.</i>

133
00:11:37,907 --> 00:11:39,116
Stan...

134
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,912
Listen. I heard about this...

135
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:48,376
I heard about this doctor down in Emory, in Atlanta.

136
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:52,380
He's supposed to be the best.
He worked on Frank Toretto's wife.

137
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:56,384
Frank's a systems analyst.
He played centerfield for us.

138
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:59,637
You know him. The softball tournament
last Labour Day.

139
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,722
Anyway, beside the point.

140
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,018
What I was thinking is, is that I could get his number,

141
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,145
the doctor, and...

142
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,732
You know, put you all together and...

143
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:16,821
You know, you could get this thing fixed.
You could beat it.

144
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:20,282
Thanks, Chuck.

145
00:12:21,117 --> 00:12:23,035
So, I'll get his number.

146
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:33,379
- And why is that?
- When it's chemically ordered...

147
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:49,353
- Is Kelly Frears around?
- She's copying her dissertation.

148
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,512
- You're home.
- Home indeed.

149
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:25,556
I love that you're home.

150
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:48,579
<i>Just days before Santa departs
on his annual gift-giving venture,</i>

151
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,415
<i>he's been declared physically fit to fly.</i>

152
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:55,503
<i>Santa got checked out at the
VA Hospital in Augusta, Georgia.</i>

153
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:58,255
<i>After doctors declared the jolly old elf in tiptop shape,</i>

154
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:01,926
<i>Santa took off into the wild blue yonder
for an early start.</i>

155
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:04,595
<i>In Sarajevo, he spent the day with children,</i>

156
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:07,264
<i>handing out presents and even helping them decorate</i>

157
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:09,433
<i>the special Christmas tree.</i>

158
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:18,025
<i>Santa and elves took over the floor
at the Hong Kong Futures Exchange.</i>

159
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,778
<i>Market traders bought Santa hats...</i>

160
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:47,638
- The turkey's a bit dry, isn't it?
- No. The turkey is perfect!

161
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:54,770
- How many did you do last night?
- Last night? 2.9 million.

162
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:58,816
Now, you've got to be in the market
for more of these candied yams.

163
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,486
2.9 has got to be the record.

164
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:03,988
Look at those marshmallows.

165
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:08,325
- We thought two million was a big deal.
- The glory days.

166
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:11,370
- What'd they do the first night?
- First night?

167
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,330
- Twelve.
- Twelve thousand?

168
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:15,958
- Hell, no. Twelve.
- That's right.

169
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,252
They did the sort right there on a card table.

170
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:21,463
And Fred Smith had that card table bronzed.

171
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,091
I've been hearing that for five years.

172
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:28,304
- It's in his office today.
- From that to the hub at Anchorage.

173
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:32,474
It's a perfect marriage between
technology and systems management.

174
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:38,022
Speaking of marriage, when are you
gonna make an honest woman of Kelly?

175
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:41,900
- How long?
- Fourteen minutes into the meal.

176
00:15:42,026 --> 00:15:44,028
You won. I owe you five.

177
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,697
- Way before the pie.
- I told him.

178
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,950
Right about the time the pie came out, the marriage...

179
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:53,078
Kelly's still recovering after that parolee.

180
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:55,289
He was a lawyer.

181
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:59,335
I knew it had something to do
with swearing to tell the truth.

182
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:02,838
Remember when he fell and broke
his shoulder at the wedding reception?

183
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,716
He tripped on a kerb holding a door open for me.

184
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,595
- Aunt Kelly was married?
- It's not worth remembering.

185
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,056
So since her failed marriage to the parolee...

186
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:13,891
Oh, my God.

187
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:17,102
Kelly can't see being with a man
who wears a pager to bed.

188
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,146
What are you gonna attach it to?

189
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:22,107
When you wear it to bed,
I hope you got one of those things

190
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:23,942
that goes vibrating.

191
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:27,279
I'm not touching that.

192
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:29,990
Oh, did you hit an olive pit?

193
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:33,702
- I thought I took all of them out.
- No, no, it's not that.

194
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:03,148
- Okay, I'll cancel Saturday.
- No, don't.

195
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,859
If I'm not here, I'm not.
But if I am, then I am.

196
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:08,696
It's cancelled.
But you gotta be here New Year's Eve.

197
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:11,281
Malaysia can't be that bad.

198
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:14,034
- When do you defend your dissertation?
- January 12.

199
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,539
I'm gonna have to switch over the South America thing.

200
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:21,125
If I do that on the third or fourth,

201
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,918
I'll have to head back out on the 13th.

202
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,962
So long as you're here New Year's Eve.

203
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,840
I will be here New Year's Eve. I promise.

204
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,053
What?

205
00:17:33,721 --> 00:17:35,973
What about our Christmas?
I got a gift for you.

206
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,061
We have to do it in the car.

207
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:49,820
I'd just like a minute over here,
all right? Thanks.

208
00:17:57,286 --> 00:18:01,081
Two minutes, okay? Two more minutes.
Thanks. Hey!

209
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:04,251
- Merry Christmas.
- I thought you were gonna stiff me.

210
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:05,586
What is the ribbon?

211
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:08,797
A thousand-pound test fishing line
or something?

212
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,258
- Here's your fancy thing.
- Thanks.

213
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,514
I love the wrapping.

214
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,477
- And I love the box.
- Good.

215
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:30,569
Oh, my. Oh, that is terrific.

216
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:33,864
My granddaddy used it on the Southern Pacific.

217
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,162
Hey, I took this.
This is my favourite picture of you.

218
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:43,707
You know what I'm gonna do?

219
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,919
I'm always gonna keep this on Memphis time.

220
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:52,716
Kelly time.

221
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,804
You haven't said anything about your presents.

222
00:18:56,887 --> 00:19:00,182
I'm sorry. No, I love them.
Look at my journal.

223
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:05,103
- What about the pager?
- Real leather. Gold on the pages!

224
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:08,106
- Did you like the pager or not?
- Yes. I love it.

225
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,068
Look at him in his little blue Russian house.

226
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:12,986
- It's from Russia.
- My God.

227
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,948
- It's not one of those loud ones?
- No.

228
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:20,244
You can program it so it vibrates
and lights up and see it in the dark.

229
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:23,205
It seems like a real nice... pager.

230
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:27,209
- Sorry about the towels.
- I love them!

231
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:29,628
- You're hard to shop for.
- Every time I wash my hands,

232
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:32,256
- I will think of you.
- All right, I gotta go.

233
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,883
Merry Christmas.

234
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:36,844
- Merry Christmas.
- I love you.

235
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:38,470
I love you, too.

236
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,104
Chuck!

237
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:48,605
Keys!

238
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:01,493
- Thank you.
- That reminds me. I almost forgot.

239
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:03,912
I have one more present for you.

240
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:09,459
Only this isn't an "open in the car" kind of present

241
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,339
like, say, hand towels.
Which were a joke, by the way.

242
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:20,888
I'm terrified.

243
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:26,727
Just take it and hold on to it,
and you can open it on New Year's Eve.

244
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,147
And I love you.

245
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,153
I'll be right back.

246
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,282
Hey, Al, where are we?

247
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,618
Somewhere over the Pacific Ocean.

248
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:27,371
You pilots, you're funny.

249
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:29,623
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

250
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:32,376
Position Jenna at 1526...

251
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:35,629
Is this turbulence from Santa
and those eight tiny reindeer?

252
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:38,131
... Tamara at 1620.

253
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:39,758
Erick is next.

254
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:42,260
Fuel, niner-five-decimal-five.

255
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:45,764
Blaine, tell them we're deviating.

256
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:48,266
Make a position plot on your left.

257
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:50,644
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

258
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,397
Position Jenna at 1526.

259
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:55,899
- Flight level 350.
- I got us plotted.

260
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,902
We're 200 miles south of original course.

261
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:01,738
Continue plotting, check contingency procedures.

262
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:04,992
Tahiti Control.
FedEx 88 broadcasting in the blind.

263
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:06,243
How do you read?

264
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:10,872
- I've never been out this long.
- Did you try the higher HF frequency?

265
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:14,501
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

266
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:17,337
Better buckle up, Chuck.
It's gonna get bumpy.

267
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:21,508
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88. Do you read?

268
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:33,061
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

269
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:35,647
Position Jenna at 1526.

270
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:38,025
Flight level 350.

271
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:39,901
Expecting Tamara at one...

272
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,489
Explosion! Let's get a hose!

273
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:31,369
Hold on to it! Come on!

274
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:35,707
Seatbelt!

275
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,759
We may have to ditch!

276
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:56,478
Okay?

277
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:01,566
Fire in the hold! We're going down!

278
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,194
Mayday! Mayday!

279
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:16,873
Bringing it down and out!

280
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:21,503
Ten thousand feet! Masks off!
Masks off!

281
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:27,300
Chuck! Life vest!

282
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:02,627
Chuck! Chuck, stay there!

283
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,796
Where's your life vest?

284
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:31,448
Ditching switch on!

285
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:46,922
I've got visual!

286
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:54,262
Brace for impact!

287
00:34:47,003 --> 00:34:49,297
Hello!

288
00:36:30,648 --> 00:36:31,941
Hello!

289
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:34,944
Anybody!

290
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:48,791
Anybody!

291
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:54,714
Help!

292
00:36:56,674 --> 00:36:58,134
Help!

293
00:39:05,553 --> 00:39:06,929
What is that?

294
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,184
Hey!

295
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,823
Hey!

296
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:28,576
Anybody?

297
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:41,537
Hello?

298
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:38,649
Get! Go, go. Go! Go!

299
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:39,334
"Albert R Miller."

300
00:48:40,627 --> 00:48:42,879
Not Alan. Albert.

301
00:50:03,919 --> 00:50:05,504
So, that's it.

302
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:05,809
Hey! A ship! Hey! Hey!

303
00:53:06,893 --> 00:53:08,603
Hey! Hey! A ship!

304
00:53:10,355 --> 00:53:12,148
Over here! Hey!

305
00:53:12,524 --> 00:53:17,070
Hey! Over here! Over here!

306
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:28,081
Over here! Over here! Over here!

307
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:31,376
Help me! Help! Right here! Right here!

308
00:53:31,459 --> 00:53:33,169
Help! Look here! Look, look, look!

309
00:53:33,628 --> 00:53:38,216
S... O... S! Please!

310
00:53:38,842 --> 00:53:42,721
Help! Come on! Help!

311
01:02:44,178 --> 01:02:45,805
"Happy birthday.

312
01:02:48,474 --> 01:02:52,520
"The most beautiful thing
in the world is the world itself.

313
01:02:53,354 --> 01:02:57,275
"Johnny, have the happiest
birthday ever. Score! Your Grandpa."

314
01:06:05,296 --> 01:06:09,425
Come on. Come on. Come on.

315
01:06:10,259 --> 01:06:13,512
Come on. Come on.

316
01:10:44,825 --> 01:10:48,329
You wouldn't have a match by any chance, would you?

317
01:11:10,517 --> 01:11:11,518
The air got to it.

318
01:11:12,019 --> 01:11:13,437
The air got to it!

319
01:11:56,313 --> 01:11:58,357
Come on, come on.

320
01:11:59,066 --> 01:12:00,067
Come on.

321
01:12:04,488 --> 01:12:06,198
I did it. I did it.

322
01:12:11,078 --> 01:12:12,246
Fire!

323
01:12:13,455 --> 01:12:16,959
There you go! Light it up! Come on!

324
01:12:17,668 --> 01:12:19,920
<i>The time to hesitate is through</i>

325
01:12:24,758 --> 01:12:28,387
<i>No time to wallow in the mire</i>

326
01:12:28,595 --> 01:12:31,056
<i>Try now, we can only lose</i>

327
01:12:32,099 --> 01:12:34,935
<i>'Cause, girl, we couldn't get much higher</i>

328
01:12:35,019 --> 01:12:38,313
<i>Come on, baby, light my fire</i>

329
01:12:39,064 --> 01:12:41,608
There you go! Here you go!

330
01:12:41,942 --> 01:12:44,111
It's a signal fire!

331
01:12:45,446 --> 01:12:48,699
And it spells out SOS!

332
01:12:51,785 --> 01:12:53,120
It's a meteor shower!

333
01:12:54,455 --> 01:12:55,873
Fireflies! Go! Run!

334
01:12:56,915 --> 01:12:58,125
You're free! You're free!

335
01:13:00,419 --> 01:13:01,420
Yeah!

336
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:02,796
Yes!

337
01:13:03,672 --> 01:13:05,466
Look what I have created!

338
01:13:06,216 --> 01:13:07,843
I have made fire!

339
01:13:08,302 --> 01:13:11,180
I have made fire!

340
01:13:32,493 --> 01:13:34,244
You gotta love crab.

341
01:13:36,663 --> 01:13:38,457
In the nick of time, too.

342
01:13:40,584 --> 01:13:43,629
I couldn't take much more of those coconuts.

343
01:13:43,712 --> 01:13:45,672
Coconut milk's a natural laxative.

344
01:13:47,883 --> 01:13:50,385
Things that Gilligan never told us.

345
01:14:04,775 --> 01:14:07,277
Pretty well-made fire, huh, Wilson?

346
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:17,329
So, Wilson.

347
01:14:18,664 --> 01:14:24,044
We were en route from Memphis for 11 and a half hours.

348
01:14:25,045 --> 01:14:28,841
About 475 miles an hour.

349
01:14:28,924 --> 01:14:31,760
So they think that we are right here.

350
01:14:33,053 --> 01:14:37,391
But we went out of radio contact,

351
01:14:38,559 --> 01:14:41,770
then flew around that storm for about an hour.

352
01:14:42,563 --> 01:14:45,732
So that's a distance of what, 400 miles?

353
01:14:47,317 --> 01:14:48,986
Four hundred miles squared.

354
01:14:49,069 --> 01:14:54,408
That's 160,000 times pi,

355
01:14:54,491 --> 01:14:57,244
3.14.

356
01:14:59,997 --> 01:15:03,876
502,004...

357
01:15:04,585 --> 01:15:08,255
That's a search area of 500,000 square miles.

358
01:15:10,924 --> 01:15:13,093
That's twice the size of Texas.

359
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:17,472
They may never find us.

360
01:15:42,623 --> 01:15:44,791
This tooth is just killing me.

361
01:15:45,459 --> 01:15:47,794
It started out just hurting when I bit down,

362
01:15:47,878 --> 01:15:51,465
but now it just hurts all the time.

363
01:15:51,965 --> 01:15:53,467
All the time.

364
01:15:55,302 --> 01:15:57,221
It's a good thing there's not much to eat around here,

365
01:15:57,304 --> 01:15:59,723
'cause I don't think I could chew it.

366
01:16:00,974 --> 01:16:04,770
Just keep sucking on all that coconut and all that crab.

367
01:16:07,189 --> 01:16:12,819
And just think, I used to avoid
going to the dentist like the plague.

368
01:16:14,905 --> 01:16:16,740
I put it off every single chance I got.

369
01:16:16,823 --> 01:16:18,158
But now...

370
01:16:18,784 --> 01:16:20,911
Oh, what I wouldn't give

371
01:16:22,746 --> 01:16:25,874
to have a dentist right here in this cave.

372
01:16:31,338 --> 01:16:33,840
In fact, I wish you were a dentist.

373
01:16:39,137 --> 01:16:40,138
Yeah.

374
01:16:41,265 --> 01:16:42,808
Dr Wilson.

375
01:16:53,443 --> 01:16:55,153
You wanna hear something funny?

376
01:16:57,072 --> 01:16:58,865
Back home in Memphis,

377
01:17:00,242 --> 01:17:03,287
my dentist's name is Dr James Spalding.

378
01:17:24,516 --> 01:17:26,893
She's much prettier in real life.

379
01:21:45,777 --> 01:21:46,987
Shut up!

380
01:22:52,218 --> 01:22:53,762
"Bakersfield"?

381
01:22:58,391 --> 01:22:59,768
Bakersfield!

382
01:23:57,826 --> 01:23:59,452
This could work.

383
01:24:02,122 --> 01:24:03,289
This could work.

384
01:24:37,365 --> 01:24:40,994
22, 44 lashings.

385
01:24:42,912 --> 01:24:44,622
44 lashings. So...

386
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:49,252
We have to make rope again.

387
01:24:53,339 --> 01:24:55,633
Wilson, we have to make a hell of a lot of rope.

388
01:25:02,807 --> 01:25:06,936
Eight lashings of these structurals.
That's 24 apiece.

389
01:25:07,645 --> 01:25:11,191
That'll be 100... 160.

390
01:25:12,525 --> 01:25:13,526
<i>Here we are today.</i>

391
01:25:13,902 --> 01:25:18,114
That gives us a month and a half
until we're into March and April,

392
01:25:18,198 --> 01:25:22,035
which is our best chances for high tides
and offshore breezes.

393
01:25:23,077 --> 01:25:24,579
We need...

394
01:25:24,662 --> 01:25:29,751
We need 424 feet of good rope,

395
01:25:29,834 --> 01:25:32,796
another 50 feet for miscellaneous.

396
01:25:32,879 --> 01:25:36,049
Round that off to 475 feet of good rope.

397
01:25:36,591 --> 01:25:40,220
Now, if we average 15 feet a day...

398
01:25:40,929 --> 01:25:44,682
Plus, we have to build it,

399
01:25:45,391 --> 01:25:48,937
we have to stock it, we have to launch it.

400
01:25:51,439 --> 01:25:52,607
That's gonna be tight.

401
01:25:53,817 --> 01:25:55,568
That is not much time.

402
01:25:57,111 --> 01:25:58,446
But we...

403
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:01,616
We live and we die by time, don't we?

404
01:26:03,993 --> 01:26:07,747
Now, let's not commit the sin
of turning our back on time.

405
01:26:13,086 --> 01:26:14,087
I know.

406
01:26:15,713 --> 01:26:16,923
I know.

407
01:26:37,944 --> 01:26:39,320
This is it.

408
01:26:42,115 --> 01:26:43,616
That's all that's left.

409
01:26:45,285 --> 01:26:48,246
I checked over the whole island,
and that is all that's left.

410
01:26:48,538 --> 01:26:50,582
So we're gonna be short.

411
01:26:53,668 --> 01:26:54,836
Short.

412
01:27:02,468 --> 01:27:06,139
We're just gonna have to make some more out of videotape.

413
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:08,725
Yes. No, we have time.

414
01:27:08,808 --> 01:27:10,560
We do. We have time. Look!

415
01:27:10,643 --> 01:27:13,354
The wind's still blowing in from the west.

416
01:27:19,694 --> 01:27:20,695
I know!

417
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:25,325
Yeah, I know. I know where
there's 30 feet of extra rope!

418
01:27:25,533 --> 01:27:26,534
But...

419
01:27:26,826 --> 01:27:28,786
But I'm not going back up there.

420
01:28:41,067 --> 01:28:44,070
There, there. There, you see? Huh?

421
01:28:44,237 --> 01:28:46,698
There. Are you happy?

422
01:28:53,871 --> 01:28:57,333
Do you have to keep bringing that up?
Can't you just forget it?

423
01:28:57,709 --> 01:28:59,919
Huh? You were right.

424
01:29:01,671 --> 01:29:03,589
You were right.
It was good that we did a test,

425
01:29:03,673 --> 01:29:06,259
'cause it wasn't gonna be just a quick little snap.

426
01:29:07,010 --> 01:29:09,429
I would have landed on the rocks.

427
01:29:10,388 --> 01:29:13,141
Broken my leg or my back or my neck.

428
01:29:14,183 --> 01:29:17,562
Bled to death. It was the only option
I had though, okay?

429
01:29:18,062 --> 01:29:19,939
It was what, a year ago?

430
01:29:20,481 --> 01:29:22,275
So let's just forget it.

431
01:29:26,904 --> 01:29:28,781
And what is your point?

432
01:29:30,783 --> 01:29:34,996
Well... We might just make it.

433
01:29:35,496 --> 01:29:37,915
Did that thought ever cross your brain?

434
01:29:39,292 --> 01:29:42,962
Regardless, I would rather take
my chance out on the ocean

435
01:29:43,254 --> 01:29:46,049
than to stay here and die on this shithole island,

436
01:29:46,132 --> 01:29:51,220
spending the rest of my life
talking to a goddamn volleyball!

437
01:29:56,559 --> 01:29:57,977
Shut you up.

438
01:30:05,985 --> 01:30:07,195
Wilson!

439
01:30:08,154 --> 01:30:09,155
Wilson!

440
01:30:16,329 --> 01:30:17,663
Wilson!

441
01:30:19,082 --> 01:30:20,083
Wilson!

442
01:30:22,502 --> 01:30:23,669
Wilson!

443
01:30:25,671 --> 01:30:26,672
Wilson.

444
01:30:30,051 --> 01:30:31,260
Wilson!

445
01:30:33,304 --> 01:30:34,806
Oh, God!

446
01:30:34,889 --> 01:30:37,016
Wilson! Wilson!

447
01:30:37,934 --> 01:30:39,811
Wilson!

448
01:30:45,191 --> 01:30:48,194
Never again.

449
01:30:48,444 --> 01:30:50,446
Never again, never again.

450
01:30:50,738 --> 01:30:53,574
You're okay. You okay? Yeah.

451
01:31:12,552 --> 01:31:14,178
Yeah, I know you.

452
01:31:15,012 --> 01:31:17,223
I know you. I know you.

453
01:31:22,270 --> 01:31:25,481
So... We okay?

454
01:31:27,066 --> 01:31:28,151
Okay?

455
01:31:31,112 --> 01:31:32,113
Okay.

456
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:12,296
You still awake?

457
01:33:15,216 --> 01:33:16,592
Me, too.

458
01:33:24,809 --> 01:33:26,185
You scared?

459
01:33:30,022 --> 01:33:31,357
Me, too.

460
01:34:49,602 --> 01:34:50,644
Okay.

461
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:52,730
Here we go, Wilson.

462
01:34:53,189 --> 01:34:57,360
You don't have to worry about anything.
I'll do all the paddling.

463
01:34:59,111 --> 01:35:00,237
You just hang on.

464
01:35:46,325 --> 01:35:48,244
Not yet! Hold on!

465
01:36:00,506 --> 01:36:03,342
Not yet! Not yet!

466
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:07,430
Not yet!

467
01:36:10,850 --> 01:36:12,184
Stand by, Wilson!

468
01:36:13,894 --> 01:36:16,772
Hold on! Hold on, Wilson!

469
01:36:36,083 --> 01:36:37,293
I think we did it!

470
01:36:38,377 --> 01:36:40,087
I think we did it!

471
01:36:41,172 --> 01:36:42,173
Wilson!

472
01:36:45,468 --> 01:36:46,552
I think we did it!

473
01:40:20,099 --> 01:40:21,809
They're gone!

474
01:40:27,981 --> 01:40:29,608
I don't know why!

475
01:41:53,150 --> 01:41:54,693
Where's Wilson?

476
01:41:57,070 --> 01:41:58,697
Where's Wilson?

477
01:42:00,073 --> 01:42:01,950
Wilson, where are you?

478
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:04,995
Wilson!

479
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:10,709
Wilson!

480
01:42:12,211 --> 01:42:13,212
Wilson!

481
01:42:41,824 --> 01:42:43,826
Wilson! I'm coming!

482
01:42:46,954 --> 01:42:47,955
Wilson!

483
01:43:09,226 --> 01:43:10,227
Wilson!

484
01:43:11,728 --> 01:43:12,938
Wilson...

485
01:43:19,444 --> 01:43:20,654
Wilson!

486
01:43:26,869 --> 01:43:29,288
Wilson! Wilson!

487
01:43:43,468 --> 01:43:44,469
Wilson!

488
01:43:48,015 --> 01:43:49,016
Wilson!

489
01:43:50,309 --> 01:43:51,643
I'm sorry!

490
01:43:53,478 --> 01:43:55,147
I'm sorry, Wilson!

491
01:43:56,273 --> 01:43:57,941
Wilson, I'm sorry!

492
01:43:59,359 --> 01:44:00,694
I'm sorry!

493
01:44:01,778 --> 01:44:02,988
Wilson!

494
01:44:04,489 --> 01:44:05,699
I can't!

495
01:44:06,867 --> 01:44:07,868
Wilson!

496
01:44:09,536 --> 01:44:11,622
Wilson!

497
01:44:49,534 --> 01:44:51,870
I'm... I'm sorry.

498
01:44:54,998 --> 01:44:56,708
I'm sorry.

499
01:44:59,252 --> 01:45:01,338
I'm sorry.

500
01:47:02,501 --> 01:47:03,752
Kelly...

501
01:47:10,133 --> 01:47:11,134
Kelly.

502
01:47:13,345 --> 01:47:14,471
Kelly...

503
01:47:21,228 --> 01:47:22,395
Hello?

504
01:47:22,938 --> 01:47:24,523
Oh, how are you?

505
01:47:26,191 --> 01:47:27,192
Okay.

506
01:48:09,401 --> 01:48:10,402
45 minutes.

507
01:48:12,362 --> 01:48:13,947
One Dr Pepper,

508
01:48:15,198 --> 01:48:16,658
two cups of ice.

509
01:48:17,492 --> 01:48:18,869
I like ice.

510
01:48:22,164 --> 01:48:24,291
Well, here's the drill.

511
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,043
Plane pulls in, we get off,

512
01:48:27,127 --> 01:48:30,088
and there's a little ceremony right there in the hangar.

513
01:48:31,173 --> 01:48:33,508
Fred Smith will say a few words.

514
01:48:33,633 --> 01:48:37,179
All you have to do is smile and say thank you.

515
01:48:38,513 --> 01:48:40,599
Then we'll take you over to see Kelly.

516
01:48:43,226 --> 01:48:45,729
She's actually gonna be there, huh?

517
01:48:46,688 --> 01:48:48,773
Well, that's what we have arranged.

518
01:48:48,857 --> 01:48:52,319
- If you're sure you wanna do that.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Yes.

519
01:48:57,115 --> 01:48:59,284
I don't know what I'm gonna say to her.

520
01:49:00,827 --> 01:49:03,079
What in the world am I gonna say to her?

521
01:49:07,125 --> 01:49:09,794
Chuck, Kelly had to let you go.

522
01:49:10,378 --> 01:49:11,379
You know?

523
01:49:12,547 --> 01:49:16,968
She thought you were dead.
And we buried you.

524
01:49:19,971 --> 01:49:23,391
We had a funeral and a coffin, a gravestone.

525
01:49:23,475 --> 01:49:24,809
The whole thing.

526
01:49:26,645 --> 01:49:28,271
You had a coffin?

527
01:49:31,524 --> 01:49:33,068
What was in it?

528
01:49:34,486 --> 01:49:36,696
Well, everybody put something in.

529
01:49:37,364 --> 01:49:41,993
You know, just a cell phone or a beeper, some pictures.

530
01:49:42,244 --> 01:49:44,204
I put in some Elvis CDs.

531
01:49:47,249 --> 01:49:49,167
So you had my funeral,

532
01:49:51,544 --> 01:49:53,838
and then you had Mary's funeral.

533
01:49:58,969 --> 01:50:02,847
Stan, I'm so sorry I wasn't around when Mary died.

534
01:50:05,016 --> 01:50:08,520
I should've been there for you, and I wasn't.

535
01:50:12,941 --> 01:50:14,567
I'm so sorry.

536
01:50:15,527 --> 01:50:20,991
<i>Four years ago, the FedEx family lost five of our sons.</i>

537
01:50:22,033 --> 01:50:24,536
<i>That was a terrible and tragic day.</i>

538
01:50:26,162 --> 01:50:29,040
<i>But today, one of those sons,</i>

539
01:50:29,207 --> 01:50:32,502
<i>Chuck Noland, has been returned to us.</i>

540
01:50:33,378 --> 01:50:35,547
<i>Chuck, welcome home.</i>

541
01:50:44,681 --> 01:50:48,727
<i>Moments ago, Fred Smith welcomed home Chuck Noland.</i>

542
01:50:49,144 --> 01:50:50,145
<i>Michelle?</i>

543
01:50:50,228 --> 01:50:53,481
<i>It's an incredible story, to come back from the dead.</i>

544
01:50:53,565 --> 01:50:56,026
<i>So amazing that Fred Smith welcomed him.</i>

545
01:50:56,109 --> 01:50:58,236
<i>And Fred acknowledged that,</i>

546
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:00,238
<i>"While time waits for no man,</i>

547
01:51:00,322 --> 01:51:02,991
<i>"we take time to pause
to honour one of our own."</i>

548
01:51:03,074 --> 01:51:05,493
<i>Now, that's an expensive pause.</i>

549
01:51:13,376 --> 01:51:15,378
I'm sorry. I must be in the wrong place.

550
01:51:15,462 --> 01:51:17,255
No, you're in the right place.

551
01:51:18,381 --> 01:51:19,883
You probably don't remember me.

552
01:51:19,966 --> 01:51:22,635
I did root canal on you about five years ago.

553
01:51:23,178 --> 01:51:24,888
Jim Spalding referred you.

554
01:51:27,057 --> 01:51:28,600
Oh, yeah, yeah.

555
01:51:33,772 --> 01:51:35,523
I'm Kelly's husband.

556
01:51:37,359 --> 01:51:38,818
Jerry Lovett.

557
01:51:39,903 --> 01:51:41,154
Kelly wanted...

558
01:51:42,989 --> 01:51:44,783
Kelly wanted to be here...

559
01:51:47,452 --> 01:51:50,080
Look, this is very hard for everyone.

560
01:51:51,790 --> 01:51:54,793
I can't even imagine how hard it is for you.

561
01:51:58,963 --> 01:52:00,173
Kelly...

562
01:52:03,593 --> 01:52:05,303
She's had it rough.

563
01:52:05,470 --> 01:52:09,766
First when she thought she lost you,
now dealing with all of this.

564
01:52:09,974 --> 01:52:11,226
It's confusing.

565
01:52:11,434 --> 01:52:14,270
It's very emotional for her. She's...

566
01:52:17,357 --> 01:52:18,358
She's

567
01:52:19,734 --> 01:52:21,319
sort of lost.

568
01:52:23,321 --> 01:52:25,615
Maybe you could just give her a little more time.

569
01:52:31,162 --> 01:52:32,163
Anyway...

570
01:52:33,706 --> 01:52:35,333
I'm sorry that...

571
01:53:32,932 --> 01:53:34,684
Okay, people, let's go.

572
01:53:34,767 --> 01:53:36,895
Party's over. Let's go home.

573
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:39,856
You're gonna have to go down at the DMV.

574
01:53:40,356 --> 01:53:42,358
Okay, Maynard, let's go.
Chuck's had a big day.

575
01:53:42,442 --> 01:53:46,279
I have to brief him on his meetings
with the accountants and attorneys.

576
01:53:46,362 --> 01:53:48,656
I will see you bright and early in the morning.

577
01:53:49,157 --> 01:53:52,076
Chuck, welcome home. We love you.

578
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:53,661
Becca, I need to speak to you.

579
01:53:53,745 --> 01:53:57,040
Chuck, we gotta catch up on some of that fishing, now.

580
01:53:57,248 --> 01:53:58,583
Take care.

581
01:54:01,836 --> 01:54:03,755
- Good night.
- Good night.

582
01:54:07,383 --> 01:54:09,427
You got everything you need?

583
01:54:09,511 --> 01:54:14,015
Okay. If you need anything, sign for it,
and I'll see you in the morning.

584
01:54:14,098 --> 01:54:17,101
Get some sleep.
We got another big day tomorrow.

585
01:54:17,185 --> 01:54:19,938
It takes a lot of paperwork to bring back a man.

586
01:54:21,272 --> 01:54:22,774
Bring you back to life, man.

587
01:54:23,816 --> 01:54:25,693
- Bye, Chuck.
- Take care, now.

588
01:54:25,777 --> 01:54:26,861
Tomorrow.

589
01:54:26,945 --> 01:54:29,447
Tomorrow we're gonna bring you back to life.

590
01:56:14,552 --> 01:56:16,220
How long are you gonna be, man?

591
01:56:18,556 --> 01:56:19,724
Well...

592
01:56:21,309 --> 01:56:24,062
- How long will that buy me?
- About ten minutes.

593
01:56:48,461 --> 01:56:49,796
I'm awake.

594
01:56:50,630 --> 01:56:52,632
I saw your taxi drive up.

595
01:56:55,176 --> 01:56:57,303
Get in here out of the rain.

596
01:57:04,102 --> 01:57:07,855
I saw you down at the hub today,
so I know you were down there.

597
01:57:27,125 --> 01:57:29,043
Let me get you a towel.

598
01:57:40,972 --> 01:57:42,473
They're sleeping.

599
01:57:46,644 --> 01:57:49,981
You'll come in, I'll make you some coffee?

600
01:58:02,410 --> 01:58:04,078
It's a nice house.

601
01:58:04,162 --> 01:58:05,830
Yeah, we got a nice mortgage, too.

602
01:58:14,172 --> 01:58:15,923
What's your daughter's name?

603
01:58:17,008 --> 01:58:18,009
Katie.

604
01:58:19,635 --> 01:58:20,636
Katie.

605
01:58:24,849 --> 01:58:26,601
She's a beautiful little girl.

606
01:58:26,684 --> 01:58:27,977
She's a handful.

607
01:58:42,533 --> 01:58:44,243
Let me get one thing straight.

608
01:58:54,128 --> 01:58:57,507
We have a pro football team now,
but they're in Nashville?

609
01:59:03,471 --> 01:59:06,182
Yeah. Oh, my God. Okay.

610
01:59:06,682 --> 01:59:08,059
They used to be in Houston.

611
01:59:08,601 --> 01:59:11,687
First they were the Oilers, and now they're the Titans.

612
01:59:12,396 --> 01:59:15,066
The Houston Oilers are the Tennessee Titans?

613
01:59:15,566 --> 01:59:18,402
Yeah. But that's not all.

614
01:59:19,028 --> 01:59:21,656
They went to the Super Bowl last year.

615
01:59:22,156 --> 01:59:24,826
- And I missed that.
- You would've died.

616
01:59:24,909 --> 01:59:28,830
They almost won by one yard.
One lousy yard, right at the end.

617
01:59:30,790 --> 01:59:34,168
I got whole milk, 2% and non-fat.

618
01:59:34,252 --> 01:59:37,296
I don't have any half-and-half,
and that's what you like.

619
01:59:37,797 --> 01:59:39,173
That'll do fine.

620
01:59:52,687 --> 01:59:54,939
What happened to you becoming a professor?

621
01:59:57,567 --> 02:00:00,611
You're not Dr Kelly Frears-Lovett?

622
02:00:03,990 --> 02:00:04,991
When you...

623
02:00:06,492 --> 02:00:08,202
When your plane went down,

624
02:00:09,495 --> 02:00:12,039
everything just sort of got put on hold.

625
02:00:14,458 --> 02:00:16,794
I think about taking it up again, though.

626
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:31,517
I came out here to give you this.

627
02:00:32,685 --> 02:00:34,437
Oh, my God.

628
02:00:36,856 --> 02:00:38,900
I'm sorry it doesn't work.

629
02:00:40,443 --> 02:00:42,820
And I kept the picture.

630
02:00:44,447 --> 02:00:46,407
It was all faded anyway.

631
02:00:47,783 --> 02:00:49,994
I want you to have it. I gave it to you.

632
02:00:50,703 --> 02:00:53,998
That's a family heirloom
and it should stay in your family.

633
02:01:03,674 --> 02:01:07,178
That's everything I have from when you went down to now.

634
02:01:08,763 --> 02:01:11,349
They said they never figured out what caused the crash.

635
02:01:11,682 --> 02:01:15,227
Probably some mislabelled hazardous material caught fire.

636
02:01:18,981 --> 02:01:21,192
So here's where that ship found you.

637
02:01:22,985 --> 02:01:25,363
You drifted about 500 miles.

638
02:01:26,364 --> 02:01:28,491
This is where your island was,

639
02:01:28,699 --> 02:01:31,702
about 600 miles south of the Cook Islands.

640
02:01:33,496 --> 02:01:35,748
And these are the search grids.

641
02:01:35,831 --> 02:01:39,168
Ships went back and forth for weeks looking for you.

642
02:01:47,468 --> 02:01:50,179
I never should've gotten on that plane.

643
02:01:52,098 --> 02:01:54,350
I never should've gotten out of the car.

644
02:01:58,479 --> 02:02:00,439
I wanna show you something.

645
02:02:02,525 --> 02:02:03,693
Come here.

646
02:02:13,953 --> 02:02:16,080
This is... This is our car.

647
02:02:18,416 --> 02:02:20,376
You kept our car.

648
02:02:22,545 --> 02:02:24,547
All right, now...

649
02:02:25,006 --> 02:02:26,507
This is weird.

650
02:02:34,265 --> 02:02:35,808
It's a good car.

651
02:02:36,434 --> 02:02:38,853
Had a lot of memories in this car.

652
02:02:38,936 --> 02:02:40,730
Two very nice memories.

653
02:02:41,605 --> 02:02:44,233
Oh, that trip down to the Gulf, yeah.

654
02:02:46,235 --> 02:02:47,945
So, can I drive it?

655
02:02:48,362 --> 02:02:49,905
It's your car.

656
02:02:58,039 --> 02:03:01,000
That's good, 'cause my... My taxi's gone.

657
02:03:09,592 --> 02:03:11,844
Let me get some stuff out of the back.

658
02:03:34,075 --> 02:03:36,577
You think you're gonna have more kids?

659
02:03:36,660 --> 02:03:37,995
I don't know.

660
02:03:38,329 --> 02:03:40,748
It's kind of confusing right now.

661
02:03:41,624 --> 02:03:43,000
Well, you should.

662
02:03:44,168 --> 02:03:46,420
I mean, really, you should.

663
02:03:48,672 --> 02:03:49,673
I would.

664
02:03:52,676 --> 02:03:54,303
So, what now?

665
02:03:57,723 --> 02:03:59,183
I don't know.

666
02:04:02,269 --> 02:04:04,021
I really don't know.

667
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:18,702
You said you'd be right back.

668
02:04:23,958 --> 02:04:25,751
I'm so sorry.

669
02:04:27,795 --> 02:04:29,004
Me, too.

670
02:05:39,116 --> 02:05:40,117
Chuck!

671
02:05:44,663 --> 02:05:45,706
Chuck!

672
02:05:47,291 --> 02:05:48,584
Chuck!

673
02:06:07,228 --> 02:06:09,438
I always knew you were alive.
I knew it.

674
02:06:11,190 --> 02:06:13,234
But everybody said I had to stop saying that,

675
02:06:13,317 --> 02:06:14,693
that I had to let you go.

676
02:06:16,820 --> 02:06:18,197
I love you.

677
02:06:20,115 --> 02:06:22,159
You're the love of my life.

678
02:06:24,328 --> 02:06:26,121
I love you, too, Kelly.

679
02:06:28,249 --> 02:06:29,833
More than you'll ever know.

680
02:07:30,769 --> 02:07:31,770
Chuck?

681
02:07:39,653 --> 02:07:41,405
You have to go home.

682
02:08:30,788 --> 02:08:36,543
We both had done the math, and Kelly added it all up.

683
02:08:39,296 --> 02:08:41,048
She knew she had to let me go.

684
02:08:41,131 --> 02:08:43,801
I added it up, knew that I'd...

685
02:08:45,677 --> 02:08:46,845
I'd lost her.

686
02:08:49,598 --> 02:08:52,393
'Cause I was never gonna get off that island.

687
02:08:54,645 --> 02:08:58,482
I was gonna die there, totally alone.

688
02:09:05,572 --> 02:09:09,034
I mean, I was gonna get sick or
I was gonna get injured or something.

689
02:09:12,746 --> 02:09:14,623
The only choice I had,

690
02:09:17,334 --> 02:09:19,753
the only thing I could control

691
02:09:21,755 --> 02:09:24,133
was when and how

692
02:09:25,426 --> 02:09:28,137
and where
that was gonna happen. So...

693
02:09:30,472 --> 02:09:32,141
I made a rope.

694
02:09:34,852 --> 02:09:37,688
And I went up to the summit to hang myself.

695
02:09:41,358 --> 02:09:43,360
But I had to test it, you know?

696
02:09:43,444 --> 02:09:45,863
Of course. You know me.

697
02:09:48,574 --> 02:09:53,704
And the weight of the log snapped the limb of the tree.

698
02:09:53,829 --> 02:09:58,292
So I couldn't even kill myself the way I wanted to.

699
02:09:58,375 --> 02:10:01,170
I had power over nothing.

700
02:10:10,012 --> 02:10:13,599
And that's when this feeling came
over me like a warm blanket.

701
02:10:17,644 --> 02:10:20,397
I knew, somehow,

702
02:10:22,191 --> 02:10:24,526
that I had to stay alive.

703
02:10:25,903 --> 02:10:27,237
Somehow.

704
02:10:28,947 --> 02:10:31,241
I had to keep breathing,

705
02:10:33,827 --> 02:10:36,580
even though there was no reason to hope.

706
02:10:37,998 --> 02:10:41,668
And all my logic said that
I would never see this place again.

707
02:10:46,590 --> 02:10:48,425
So that's what I did.

708
02:10:49,510 --> 02:10:50,969
I stayed alive.

709
02:10:52,137 --> 02:10:53,889
I kept breathing.

710
02:10:56,350 --> 02:10:58,685
Then one day that logic was proven all wrong,

711
02:10:58,769 --> 02:11:03,440
because the tide came in,

712
02:11:03,732 --> 02:11:05,609
gave me a sail.

713
02:11:09,905 --> 02:11:11,615
And now, here I am.

714
02:11:15,077 --> 02:11:19,164
I'm back in Memphis,

715
02:11:19,373 --> 02:11:21,291
talking to you.

716
02:11:22,876 --> 02:11:24,795
I have ice in my glass.

717
02:11:32,010 --> 02:11:34,388
And I've lost her all over again.

718
02:11:42,229 --> 02:11:44,690
I'm so sad that I don't have Kelly.

719
02:11:49,903 --> 02:11:53,740
But I'm so grateful that she was with me on that island.

720
02:12:00,289 --> 02:12:02,833
And I know what I have to do now.

721
02:12:05,586 --> 02:12:07,504
I gotta keep breathing.

722
02:12:10,173 --> 02:12:12,676
Because tomorrow, the sun will rise.

723
02:12:13,844 --> 02:12:16,096
Who knows what the tide could bring?

724
02:13:22,162 --> 02:13:23,330
Hello!

725
02:13:28,377 --> 02:13:29,378
Hello!

726
02:13:38,053 --> 02:13:39,221
FedEx!

727
02:14:47,831 --> 02:14:49,082
You look lost.

728
02:14:49,583 --> 02:14:50,584
I do?

729
02:14:51,626 --> 02:14:53,003
Where are you headed?

730
02:14:57,048 --> 02:14:58,925
Well, I was just about to figure that out.

731
02:15:00,510 --> 02:15:01,887
Well, that's 83 South.

732
02:15:02,679 --> 02:15:05,807
And this road here will hook you up
with I-40 East.

733
02:15:07,350 --> 02:15:10,937
If you turn right, that'll take you to

734
02:15:11,021 --> 02:15:14,566
Amarillo, Flagstaff, California.

735
02:15:17,152 --> 02:15:19,780
And if you head back that direction,
you'll find a whole lot of nothing

736
02:15:19,863 --> 02:15:21,615
all the way to Canada.

737
02:15:24,284 --> 02:15:25,535
I got it.

738
02:15:26,161 --> 02:15:27,537
All right, then.

739
02:15:30,540 --> 02:15:32,042
Good luck, cowboy.

740
02:15:32,793 --> 02:15:33,919
Thank you.
