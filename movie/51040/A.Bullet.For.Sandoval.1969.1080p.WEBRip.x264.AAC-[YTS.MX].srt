3
00:00:12,444 --> 00:00:14,944
(tense music)

4
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:26,653
(man grunts)

5
00:02:26,653 --> 00:02:29,153
(tense music)

6
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,893
- Come on.

7
00:02:41,825 --> 00:02:44,325
(tense music)

8
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,250
- And here, according to our
most recent intelligence,

9
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,810
the Yankees have placed
two regiments of riflemen,

10
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,410
and two batteries of light artillery

11
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,133
are due to reinforce them soon.

12
00:02:59,168 --> 00:03:03,320
Yes gentlemen, the
situation is serious for us.

13
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,030
But then, if it's any consolation,

14
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,470
there hasn't been a moment during this war

15
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,170
when it wasn't serious.

16
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,510
- Right, only now we have our backs

17
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,030
on the Mexican line, sir.

18
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,650
- Ah.

19
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,740
Captain Parker.

20
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,450
Don't you realize that's
a great advantage?

21
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,920
It's a challenge to be surrounded.

22
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,823
Don't you agree, gentlemen?

23
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,970
- General, Corporal John Juan has brought

24
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,750
the information which you requested.

25
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,270
- And we also saw several
batteries of Vandenbergs.

26
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,680
You know what that means, sir.

27
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,200
- And what does that mean, Corporal?

28
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,610
- Well, they say they're murder

29
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,360
when the artillery know how to use.

30
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,430
- We can only hope, then, that the Yankees

31
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,780
don't know how to use them.

32
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,020
Did you say something, Corporal?

33
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,930
- General, I thought...

34
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,976
It's a pity that we haven't got them.

35
00:03:50,976 --> 00:03:54,770
- Well, we shall just have to
go and take them, that's all.

36
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,330
- Count on me, sir.

37
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,830
- I always count on everybody.

38
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,997
Thank you, Corporal.

39
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,673
You may go.

40
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,153
Well, Corporal's told ya.

41
00:04:15,063 --> 00:04:17,991
They outnumber us, better equipped,

42
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:21,640
and and they're fresh troops who wanna

43
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,737
finish us once and for all.

44
00:04:28,457 --> 00:04:30,460
There's only one course of action.

45
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,963
One thing left for us to do.

46
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,753
Strike first.

47
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,363
We attack at dawn.

48
00:04:43,165 --> 00:04:46,415
- [Guard] Post number four, all's well.

49
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,447
- [Guard] Post number five, all is well.

50
00:04:58,794 --> 00:05:01,544
(horse neighing)

51
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,810
- John.

52
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,690
- Hmm?

53
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,250
- Do you believe in luck?

54
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,673
- Sure, Yankee luck.

55
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,410
- I almost forgot, you got a visitor.

56
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,700
He's waiting for you over there.

57
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,680
- For me?

58
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,703
- Yeah, he's Don Pedro's young son.

59
00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:22,453
(dramatic music)

60
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,030
- What are you doing here, Francisco?

61
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,280
Don't tell me you're trying to enlist.

62
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,270
- I'm not interested in
quarrels among gringos.

63
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,120
- What's the matter, then?

64
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,640
- I'd kill you right now if my sister

65
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,230
hadn't been in trouble.

66
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,430
Rosa made me promise
to come bring you home.

67
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,480
Why are you talking like this?

68
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,990
What's happened to Rosa?

69
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,690
- Don't be a fool, Warner.

70
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,350
The little one.

71
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,255
Your son.

72
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:56,755
(tense music)

73
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,363
- Son.

74
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:04,970
My son.

75
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,570
- The next thing is the wedding.

76
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,063
- But that's what I always wanted.

77
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,270
I'll ask for a leave as soon as possible.

78
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,490
- It's not that simple.

79
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,150
You gotta marry her by tomorrow.

80
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,510
They told me something was the matter.

81
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,960
- But I can't leave the camp.

82
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,030
- Rosa may be dying, you understand that?

83
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,253
It's her last chance.

84
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,013
- Let's go.

85
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,810
- I'm surprised you could do this to Rosa.

86
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,130
You always had my support when you wanted

87
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,973
to face my father and my brothers.

88
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,903
Always.

89
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,500
They were right.

90
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,710
You're not as I thought.

91
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,653
- Who was right?

92
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,213
If they would only have
let us get married before.

93
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,520
Do they know you're here?

94
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,077
- In my house, nobody mentioned you to me.

95
00:07:00,077 --> 00:07:01,830
But the priest knows I talked to Rosa.

96
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,663
- Lie down.

97
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,530
The guide culprits coming, I think.

98
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,680
- Then shut your mouth.

99
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,300
- Just listen.

100
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,610
A true Santaville brat.

101
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,443
- So long, Sam.

102
00:07:11,443 --> 00:07:12,540
- You leavin'?

103
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,670
- For Los Sadros.

104
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,540
- Hey look, you better stay here.

105
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,020
- It's my business,
don't tell me what to do.

106
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,140
- You want to be a deserter?

107
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,840
- Now he has to fight a personal battle.

108
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,758
- You'll get hanged, John.

109
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:23,591
You want a court martial?

110
00:07:23,591 --> 00:07:25,400
They're sure to find you.

111
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,381
- They're not gonna
miss one deserter more.

112
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:29,881
(tense music)

113
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:36,156
(gunfire rumbling)

114
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,430
- The battle's just started.

115
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,405
I should have been back there.

116
00:07:45,405 --> 00:07:46,390
- If you were so important they wouldn't

117
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,540
have begun without you.

118
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:52,199
(tense music)

119
00:07:58,332 --> 00:08:00,999
(ominous music)

120
00:08:17,008 --> 00:08:18,830
- Sergeant, look at those two.

121
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,350
One's a soldier.

122
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,753
- I'm not blind.

123
00:08:21,753 --> 00:08:22,586
Halt.

124
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,120
- What do we do?

125
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,720
- Keep on going, they saw us.

126
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,553
Hyah.

127
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:38,183
- Come here, you.

128
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,710
- Sergeant, what's going on?

129
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,840
- What do you mean what's going on?

130
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,100
Aren't you Corporal
Warner from the seventh?

131
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,570
- Second company.

132
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,260
- Well, what are you doing
so far from your unit?

133
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,480
- Why, I've gotta leave
for a couple of days.

134
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,920
- Sergeant, I believe they
canceled all leaves last week.

135
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,120
- I know that, Corporal.

136
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,513
Now let's see that paper of yours.

137
00:09:07,408 --> 00:09:08,950
- I don't have it in writing.

138
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,200
It's a verbal order from my-

139
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,033
- Sure.

140
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,210
I know that kind of
leave, verbally granted

141
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,400
on the eve of a battle.

142
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,070
We had a battle this morning, and we won,

143
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,743
no thanks to you, deserter.

144
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,900
- I have to get moving.

145
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,120
Now let me go.

146
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,400
- Don't move or you'll
be buried right her.

147
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,870
- Stop that man too!

148
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,763
- No wait, forget him.

149
00:09:32,763 --> 00:09:34,570
We have to get to camp.

150
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,720
Now get off your horse.

151
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,450
- Francisco!

152
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,770
I'll come!

153
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,350
Tell that to Rose!

154
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,208
- Deserter.

155
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,423
Deserter and coward.

156
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,920
When his comrades faced
a desperate battle,

157
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,010
Corporal Warner escaped
like a frightened rat

158
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,350
into the night.

159
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,360
- Don't call me a coward.

160
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,410
- What'll I call you?

161
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,880
The hero who was going to take

162
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,280
the Yankee batteries all by himself?

163
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,713
You're the basest coward
I ever came across.

164
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,710
- Captain, I beg you to listen to me.

165
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,640
- No explanation can warrant a
soldier's betraying his flag.

166
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,240
- I have to go to Los Sadros.

167
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,090
I have to go.

168
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,123
- In the army, you don't
move about whenever you like.

169
00:10:33,311 --> 00:10:34,193
- Let me go, sir.

170
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:36,683
I beg you.

171
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,023
Under guard and chain if necessary.

172
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:44,763
Afterwards, I don't
care what happens to me.

173
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,520
- Take this man out.

174
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,523
- But Captain, please, sir!

175
00:10:53,206 --> 00:10:55,956
(horse neighing)

176
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,620
- You know what to do.

177
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,040
- Well, is it a court martial, Captain?

178
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
- Why waste time?

179
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,890
We all know he's guilty.

180
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,930
- Without giving him a trial, sir?

181
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,393
- Court martial a deserter?

182
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,300
Tonight I have a good job for him.

183
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,193
He can work on the burial party.

184
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,510
At least I'll spare a real soldier.

185
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,093
(solemn music)

186
00:11:50,796 --> 00:11:53,463
(man whistling)

187
00:12:03,553 --> 00:12:04,530
(man grunts)

188
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,770
- Hey, don't boot him in.

189
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,370
- You want me to be their nurse?

190
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,277
They don't care anyway,
and I'm tuckered out.

191
00:12:20,705 --> 00:12:21,622
Jehosaphat.

192
00:12:24,823 --> 00:12:26,573
Them yanks are heavy.

193
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,290
Reckon they must eat too much food.

194
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:35,660
(man laughing)

195
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,967
But I figure tomorrow
we'll be stiff as they are.

196
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:38,802
(man laughing)

197
00:12:38,802 --> 00:12:40,302
- Shut your mouth.

198
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,400
- What's the matter?

199
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,134
Afraid we're gonna awaken the boy?

200
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:44,967
Huh?

201
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,547
(man whistling)

202
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,503
- Hey.

203
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,750
You two go to the other pit.

204
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,660
Warner's gonna face this by hisself.

205
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,890
How do you like digging
your own grave, huh?

206
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,630
That way you can make it a perfect fit.

207
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,910
Now hurry up.

208
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,860
- Oh, sorry, Sarge.

209
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,643
Hey, this one's alive.

210
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,403
(man grunts)

211
00:13:20,403 --> 00:13:21,236
- He's a yank.

212
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:22,490
Finish him off, Warner.

213
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,520
- I won't murder a dying man.

214
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,610
- [Sergeant] It's an order.

215
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,060
Kill him with your shovel.

216
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,690
- I only kill fightin'.

217
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,593
- Huh, you're brave.

218
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,590
No good even for this, huh?

219
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,450
(tense music)

220
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,283
Give me that.

221
00:13:42,283 --> 00:13:44,580
Don't provoke me, Sergeant.

222
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,443
What's that?

223
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,527
- I said you better not do it.

224
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:50,641
(tense music)

225
00:13:50,641 --> 00:13:51,474
- Hold it.

226
00:13:51,474 --> 00:13:52,510
Are you crazy?

227
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,667
John, don't kill him.

228
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,460
- You'll only get yourself in a mess, Sam.

229
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,293
- I know it.

230
00:13:58,293 --> 00:13:59,890
Did you hear what I said?

231
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,110
John, stop.

232
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,370
Don't kill him.

233
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,203
John.

234
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,135
- You're guilty as he is, Sam.

235
00:14:08,135 --> 00:14:09,076
(man grunts)

236
00:14:09,076 --> 00:14:10,550
(tense music)

237
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,700
Plain murder.

238
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,627
Now what do we do?

239
00:14:13,627 --> 00:14:16,127
(eerie music)

240
00:14:18,998 --> 00:14:21,880
- You've both thrown away
you lives for a dead man.

241
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,330
- Perdue.

242
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,760
He was right, though.

243
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,920
Come on, John.

244
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,246
How about a couple of horses?

245
00:14:27,246 --> 00:14:29,996
(dramatic music)

246
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,140
- They went this way.

247
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,600
Heading South.

248
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,810
- To Los Sadros.

249
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,040
We must beat 'em to the pass.

250
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,433
Darn fool's heading home.

251
00:14:45,569 --> 00:14:48,319
(dramatic music)

252
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,500
- [Lucky] Just our luck.

253
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,920
They're waiting for us

254
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
Might've guessed it.

255
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,163
- No, I don't think so.

256
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,510
No one could get here before us.

257
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,353
And there isn't any telegraph.

258
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,730
I'll go see what's happened.

259
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,830
- No.

260
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,870
Better leave that to Lucky.

261
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,843
You're known there.

262
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:23,100
My, that man that man's driving

263
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,850
like the devil got him by the tail.

264
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,916
- Ha!

265
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:28,999
- Ha, ha, ha!

266
00:15:31,924 --> 00:15:33,310
Ha!

267
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,143
Ha.

268
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,370
- Hold on there!

269
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,150
Hey friend, what's the matter,
your house burning down?

270
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,057
- There's cholera in that town.

271
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:40,210
Out of my way.

272
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,284
Ha!

273
00:15:41,284 --> 00:15:42,493
Ha, ha!

274
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,350
- Hey, there's a cholera
epidemic in that town.

275
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,633
We'd better just pass it.

276
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,553
- Cholera?

277
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,500
I'm going in anyway.

278
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,827
Sam, what about you?

279
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,290
- My wife and kids are there.

280
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,220
- We'll wait until dark.

281
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,453
They might not see us.

282
00:16:08,729 --> 00:16:11,646
(insects chirping)

283
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,350
Come on, Sam.

284
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,183
So long, Lucky.

285
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,110
- Hey Warner.

286
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,580
What if our troops find us?

287
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,180
- We'll be back before daylight.

288
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:23,960
- Yeah.

289
00:16:26,613 --> 00:16:27,446
Sure.

290
00:16:29,874 --> 00:16:30,972
(tense music)

291
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:32,440
- No, not my husband!

292
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,107
Don't take him away!

293
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,187
No, please!

294
00:16:37,102 --> 00:16:37,935
Oh!

295
00:16:37,935 --> 00:16:39,210
What I am to do without him?

296
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,481
Let me take care of him.

297
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:43,430
I beg you.

298
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,263
I beg you.

299
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,710
- Shall we burn the bed, Doc?

300
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,080
- What bed?

301
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,120
They sleep on the ground.

302
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,660
Unless you want to burn their house.

303
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,653
- Whole damn square'd burn up.

304
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,486
- Fire's a lot better than cholera.

305
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:03,069
(solemn music)

306
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:16,775
(tense music)

307
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,960
- John.

308
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,520
That's my house there.

309
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,353
- All right.

310
00:17:36,353 --> 00:17:37,186
- Listen, John.

311
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,110
- What?

312
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,710
- I'll stay here with my folks.

313
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,543
They'll hide me.

314
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,380
- Good luck.

315
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,470
Thanks for everything.

316
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,303
Be careful.

317
00:17:52,265 --> 00:17:54,848
(solemn music)

318
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,870
- Oh Holy Mother.

319
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,140
It's you, Senor Warner.

320
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,190
- What's happened?

321
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,890
Is there anything wrong with Rosa?

322
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,000
- Who is it?

323
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,050
Who's there, Juanita?

324
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:19,883
You.

325
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,417
What are you doing here?

326
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,480
Why did you come?

327
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,410
- I'm not looking for a fight, Jose.

328
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,243
- I'll kill you!

329
00:18:29,243 --> 00:18:30,076
(woman gasps)

330
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,293
- [Juanita] Senor (indistinct), help!

331
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:33,740
- I told you I don't want to fight.

332
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,573
- Stop it!

333
00:18:36,526 --> 00:18:38,430
You dare to come here?

334
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,840
- I've come to marry your daughter.

335
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,400
- Don't you dirty her
name with your mouth.

336
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,780
Get out!

337
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,010
- No, I've come to marry Rosa.

338
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,820
You prevented me once, but
you won't do it tonight.

339
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,563
- Are you defying me?

340
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,173
- Don Pedro, I don't want to defy anybody.

341
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:02,160
I want to see Rosa and
give my name to our child.

342
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,463
- No gringo will ever marry my daughter.

343
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,183
Even if she was alive.

344
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,293
- Was alive?

345
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,740
What are you saying?

346
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,510
Is she sick with cholera?

347
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,580
You mean there's no hope?

348
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,023
- You dog.

349
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,943
Have you no respect?

350
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,350
The cholera didn't kill my
daughter, you killed her!

351
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,720
- You did it.

352
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,333
You and your stupid pride.

353
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,940
It would have been better to let us marry.

354
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,540
I was in love with her.

355
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,710
- In love with my land, you mean.

356
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,620
Now get out.

357
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,530
- Please, Don Pedro.

358
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,640
- I told you to go.

359
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,790
And I warn you never
to cross my path again.

360
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,853
- No, you're not letting him go.

361
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,320
- Your sister has yet to be buried,

362
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,573
and I would not disgrace
her memory with his death.

363
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,183
- Let me see her.

364
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,930
You don't know what it cost
me to get here tonight.

365
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,730
- Throw him out.

366
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:04,563
- Just a moment.

367
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,497
- Please, Father.

368
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,583
Let him see Rosa.

369
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,493
His son too.

370
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,043
(solemn music)

371
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,396
- Bring it.

372
00:20:24,396 --> 00:20:26,979
(solemn music)

373
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:48,973
That is your child.

374
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,363
Take it and go.

375
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,120
The two of you have brought enough

376
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,267
heartache into this house.

377
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:59,080
(baby crying)

378
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,830
(tinkling music)

379
00:21:12,874 --> 00:21:15,457
(solemn music)

380
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:21,892
(bell tolling)

381
00:22:04,517 --> 00:22:05,513
- You know, sir.

382
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,620
Had a feeling I'd be killed in this war,

383
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,470
but I never thought I'd die of cholera,

384
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,230
like out of that fool Warner.

385
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,720
- Well, he's the one whose
days are numbered, Corporal.

386
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,010
Don't worry.

387
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,220
- [Corporal] Yes sir.

388
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,560
- Deputy, first we want to
check out this rancher's house

389
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,983
where he once worked.

390
00:22:21,983 --> 00:22:22,816
(baby crying)

391
00:22:22,816 --> 00:22:24,471
I figure that's where he went.

392
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:26,971
(baby crying)

393
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,933
(solemn music)

394
00:22:53,108 --> 00:22:56,860
- Well, couldn't you have
left him with someone?

395
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,593
- He's my son, and he's coming with me.

396
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,420
I'm gonna cross the
Rio Grande into Mexico.

397
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,253
What about you?

398
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,483
- I'm with you.

399
00:23:09,037 --> 00:23:10,333
You need a nurse.

400
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,268
(man whistling)

401
00:23:22,251 --> 00:23:24,751
(baby crying)

402
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,500
I think he's hungry.

403
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,735
- What the hell?

404
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:32,703
So're we all.

405
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:35,591
- We'll have to find a ranch house.

406
00:23:35,591 --> 00:23:36,534
- Hyah.

407
00:23:36,534 --> 00:23:39,034
(tense music)

408
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:50,523
Look at that.

409
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,190
Just like the army.

410
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,040
What can they do?

411
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,680
War reaches everywhere.

412
00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:07,920
- What do you want?

413
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,870
- Milk for the baby and something for us.

414
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:10,883
We can pay for it.

415
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,270
- Where do you come from?

416
00:24:14,145 --> 00:24:16,810
- From Los Sadros, and without eating.

417
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,767
- From Los Sadros?

418
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:19,135
But there's cholera there.

419
00:24:19,135 --> 00:24:20,350
(speaking foreign language)

420
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,550
- Cholera.

421
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,150
Do you want to give us all cholera?

422
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:23,983
Clear out.

423
00:24:23,983 --> 00:24:24,816
- Just a minute.

424
00:24:24,816 --> 00:24:25,920
I want some milk for the child.

425
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,640
- You heard him.

426
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,770
- You're lucky, because we're unarmed.

427
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,603
- But we're not.

428
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:33,070
- Dirty Mexican.
- Get going.

429
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,330
(tense music)

430
00:24:41,934 --> 00:24:44,517
(solemn music)

431
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,730
- Hey Father.

432
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,380
Ain't that too much meat for you?

433
00:25:16,902 --> 00:25:18,703
- Not Father, Laybrother is correct.

434
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,920
- I can't tell the difference.

435
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,770
- Leave him alone.

436
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,520
- I sure hate these fellas in gowns.

437
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,803
If you know how to beg, you
should also know how to share.

438
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,550
- Come take your share, brother.

439
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,800
- You bet I will.

440
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:43,041
(Lucky chuckles)

441
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,593
Ah.

442
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:55,594
(men grunting)

443
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,200
- [John] Let him go or
I'll break your neck.

444
00:26:15,214 --> 00:26:17,797
(men grunting)

445
00:26:23,692 --> 00:26:25,860
- I'd best not take on both of you.

446
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,040
- For a father, you
can fight mighty nasty.

447
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,483
- I explain to you, brother.

448
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,773
You should say-

449
00:26:32,773 --> 00:26:34,830
- Laybrother, I heard you before.

450
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,663
Let's go.

451
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,020
- Say, Laybrother, didn't they teach you

452
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,110
to turn the other cheek?

453
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:41,943
- Yes.

454
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:46,069
But not to be decorated with initials.

455
00:26:46,069 --> 00:26:48,819
(Lucky laughing)

456
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,680
Hey, this meat is for you.

457
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,380
Sometimes the blessing of the flesh

458
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,910
help a brave man better than a spiritual.

459
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:05,113
Take the other cheek, you've earned it.

460
00:27:06,455 --> 00:27:08,340
(Lucky laughing)

461
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,660
(Laybrother laughing)

462
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,190
Hey, a man should be on that pack horse.

463
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,120
- So what?

464
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,517
It's not your problem.

465
00:27:16,517 --> 00:27:18,910
- Hombre, if Providence
has brought it here,

466
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,428
then let me ride it.

467
00:27:20,428 --> 00:27:21,261
(Lucky laughing)

468
00:27:21,261 --> 00:27:24,220
- What do you know about riding horses?

469
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,200
- It's easier than Latin, brother.

470
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,263
- Which way you going?

471
00:27:27,263 --> 00:27:29,313
- Can you think of one better than yours?

472
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,980
- Say, what's the difference between

473
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,950
a father and a laybrother?

474
00:27:43,993 --> 00:27:46,243
- Well, a father is a father.

475
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,623
A laybrother bears all the
burdens of the priesthood

476
00:27:49,623 --> 00:27:51,680
like a mule who one day gets tired

477
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,140
of being hungry and takes off.

478
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,600
- Ah, so you've taken a
leave from the monastery

479
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,260
like we did from the army.

480
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,097
- Brother, now we
understand each other, eh?

481
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:02,540
- How far away from the stage post?

482
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,640
- Less than six miles.

483
00:28:05,329 --> 00:28:07,912
(solemn music)

484
00:28:24,228 --> 00:28:27,395
- And here's something for you, honey.

485
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:32,610
- Are you in such a hurry that
you cannot stop overnight?

486
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:36,620
- Baby, if I was to stay with
you only till midnight...

487
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,963
- And why should you go so soon?

488
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,203
- Oh, if I'd only-
- Lupe!

489
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,930
I warn you.

490
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,190
Don't let me catch you again
trying to get heat in your bed.

491
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,163
Now get to work.

492
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,523
They're getting it ready now.

493
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:04,733
Aww, let me have a look at him.

494
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,070
Aww, the little darlin'.

495
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,193
Just look.

496
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:15,400
He has a fever.

497
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,430
This child's ailing.

498
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,883
He's real sick.

499
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,093
- I'm afraid so.

500
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,200
Where can I find the doctor?

501
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,390
- Well, the closest one
lives in Los Sadros,

502
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,510
but there they got...

503
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,779
Oh lord, it's the cholera.

504
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:33,660
(tense music)

505
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,170
- What are you talking about?

506
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:38,440
- You might have told me,
instead of trying to hoodwink me.

507
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,240
You come from the north,
like everyone else

508
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,370
who got out of Los Sadros.

509
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,203
- Shut up!

510
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,140
- It's you soldiers with all your killing

511
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,950
that brought on this pestilence.

512
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:50,068
You despised and been
cursed by the Lord Almighty.

513
00:29:50,068 --> 00:29:52,160
- Don't speak of the Almighty.

514
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,030
There's no bigger pestilence
than a bitter soul.

515
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,640
- Ah, none of your papist talk.

516
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,010
We're Presbyterians here.

517
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,420
- What's the matter?

518
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,680
- Give them their milk and send them away.

519
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,490
The child has cholera.

520
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,433
- I'll be durned.

521
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,570
You'll get nothing here!

522
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,240
- You give it to me or
I'll break your neck!

523
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,680
- As long as they go, let him take it!

524
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,892
- I won't be forced!

525
00:30:12,892 --> 00:30:15,710
(dramatic music)

526
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,560
- You pigs!

527
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,400
- Hold it.

528
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,833
Get moving before I shoot.

529
00:30:21,601 --> 00:30:23,889
- Don't give him the
satisfaction of killing you.

530
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:24,977
- Get out!

531
00:30:24,977 --> 00:30:26,823
- You'll see me back again.

532
00:30:33,057 --> 00:30:35,557
(dog barking)

533
00:30:37,564 --> 00:30:40,147
(solemn music)

534
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:06,078
(tinkling music)

535
00:31:12,436 --> 00:31:13,980
- Is it cholera, brother?

536
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,140
- It's his stomach.

537
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,303
The boy is famished.

538
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,180
- Wake up, wake up.

539
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,013
- What is it?

540
00:31:36,013 --> 00:31:38,300
- My son, I think he's dying.

541
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,820
You must do something.

542
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,760
- I wish I could.

543
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,680
- Do something.

544
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,730
Don't you hear me?

545
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,797
Pray, ask for a miracle!

546
00:31:45,678 --> 00:31:46,723
- It's no use!

547
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,620
- It isn't right.

548
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,963
I can't let him.

549
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:02,722
(gentle music)

550
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:18,516
- Will you do it?

551
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,673
- John.

552
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,623
- I tried all I could.

553
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,630
Just like he was a dog.

554
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,837
That's how my son died.

555
00:32:46,837 --> 00:32:48,075
(suspenseful music)

556
00:32:48,075 --> 00:32:49,283
I swear!

557
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,800
They'll pay for that!

558
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,180
- [Echo] They'll pay for that!

559
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,249
Pay for that!

560
00:32:55,249 --> 00:32:56,332
Pay for that!

561
00:32:58,099 --> 00:33:00,599
(tense music)

562
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:06,910
(thunder crashing)

563
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,660
(dramatic music)

564
00:33:21,609 --> 00:33:23,192
- Patrone, Patrone!

565
00:33:35,218 --> 00:33:36,051
Patrone!

566
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:49,660
(thunder crashing)

567
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,007
(men grunting)

568
00:33:53,007 --> 00:33:56,213
(gunshot bangs)

569
00:33:56,213 --> 00:33:58,796
(men grunting)

570
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,367
(women gasping)

571
00:34:22,465 --> 00:34:24,132
- That's all of 'em.

572
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:32,684
- What do you want of me, mister?

573
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,463
- To give you what you refused to my son.

574
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,017
Drink it!
- No!

575
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:52,989
- No!

576
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,507
No.

577
00:34:56,507 --> 00:34:57,340
No!

578
00:34:58,782 --> 00:34:59,893
Please stop.

579
00:35:01,843 --> 00:35:04,843
Oh, for the love of God, have mercy!

580
00:35:06,058 --> 00:35:08,558
(man gagging)

581
00:35:19,926 --> 00:35:22,509
(woman crying)

582
00:35:24,658 --> 00:35:27,241
(solemn music)

583
00:35:30,946 --> 00:35:33,946
(suspenseful music)

584
00:35:43,881 --> 00:35:44,789
(dog barking)

585
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:47,706
(gunshots banging)

586
00:36:44,008 --> 00:36:46,758
(dog barking)

587
00:36:46,758 --> 00:36:47,758
- I knew it.

588
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,640
A mad dog.

589
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,770
That's what he is.

590
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,310
I've always known it.

591
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,380
- Yes, but-
- Let me speak.

592
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,410
- You talk this way because
you're blind with hatred.

593
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,483
- And I have every right.

594
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,463
I hate the bastard.

595
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,490
But you as a judge should be doing

596
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,080
something about his crimes.

597
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,630
- Medicine and justice.

598
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,680
I'm beginning to get them mixed.

599
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,910
My major problem is cholera.

600
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:14,220
We arrested it, but now we're
playing with (indistinct).

601
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,610
- Oh, stop talking and do something.

602
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,350
- Stop yelling at me.

603
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,370
You can talk to your own men as you like.

604
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,663
- Sorry.

605
00:37:21,663 --> 00:37:24,870
- And besides, the problem
doesn't concern me,

606
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,210
because he's committed no offense

607
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,810
within jurisdiction of my court.

608
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,690
- Oh, but he will, all right, and soon.

609
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,070
Sooner than you think.

610
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,910
- Senor Sandoval, I can assure you

611
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,790
that we'll be ready if
he shows up here again.

612
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,340
- By doing what?

613
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,290
Sitting at your desk?

614
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,540
Don't you realize that Warner's getting

615
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,490
more dangerous every day?

616
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:48,250
He not only has two men
with him now, but five.

617
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,880
Besides the one called Lucky Boy,

618
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,460
who is a graveyard robber,
and a renegade monk

619
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,430
they call Father, he also has with him

620
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:01,700
a man called Leoni One-eye, a sex maniac

621
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,203
convicted of raping two little girls.

622
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:09,570
Another called Morton, an escaped convict

623
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,653
who claims to have killed 10 men,

624
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:16,730
and Sam Powell, jailed
for deserting with Warner,

625
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:19,500
who escaped and is now with the gang.

626
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,100
Six murderers capable of anything,

627
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,433
and with only one law, that of their guns.

628
00:38:27,788 --> 00:38:30,288
(tense music)

629
00:38:32,993 --> 00:38:35,576
(gentle music)

630
00:38:45,868 --> 00:38:48,160
(Juanita gasps)

631
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,853
I gave orders no one
must to enter this room.

632
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,130
Did you forget?

633
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,770
- No, patron.

634
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:57,493
But it's not possible
to forget la senorita.

635
00:38:57,493 --> 00:39:01,083
- You are never to mention
that name in this house again.

636
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,063
I never had a daughter.

637
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,970
No one ever slept in that bed.

638
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,763
This bedroom does not even exist.

639
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,980
Do you understand?

640
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:14,785
Do you?!

641
00:39:18,894 --> 00:39:19,727
Get out!

642
00:39:21,684 --> 00:39:22,517
Get out!

643
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:29,080
Do not pray for the soul of
somebody that never existed.

644
00:39:35,919 --> 00:39:36,752
Oh.

645
00:39:39,066 --> 00:39:41,483
(door close)

646
00:39:46,502 --> 00:39:49,085
(solemn music)

647
00:40:28,488 --> 00:40:29,738
My little girl.

648
00:40:35,256 --> 00:40:36,839
Oh, my little girl.

649
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,393
How I loved you.

650
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,237
How I loved you.

651
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:56,390
Don't let my love that was
like a pedestal of stone

652
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,363
fall like a castle of mud.

653
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,463
Please.

654
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:07,140
Let me think that you loved
me more than you did him.

655
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,973
That bastard.

656
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,063
That bastard that took you away from me.

657
00:41:23,533 --> 00:41:24,616
That bastard.

658
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,056
- Hey, we go back to Los Sandros?

659
00:41:28,056 --> 00:41:29,840
(tense music)

660
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,090
- Now is the right time
to raid 'em, I'd say.

661
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,975
Throwing the party, Sam?

662
00:41:34,975 --> 00:41:39,975
(gentle music)
(people chattering)

663
00:41:48,727 --> 00:41:50,257
(man shouting)

664
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:55,257
(gunshots banging)
(people shouting)

665
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,872
(Lucky laughing)

666
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,789
(gunshots banging)

667
00:42:26,774 --> 00:42:29,191
(man shouts)

668
00:42:33,944 --> 00:42:36,527
(solemn music)

669
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,413
- Let's see it.

670
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:58,390
- Now, Mr. Colby, maybe you'll
kindly tell us, how long?

671
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,250
How long are you going to let Warner

672
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,290
run wild over our lands?

673
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:07,210
Huh?

674
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,150
- That's unfair to Colby and me.

675
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:11,120
It's not as simple as
you think to capture him.

676
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,803
- I'm talking to Colby!

677
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:19,010
Now you did say you
were ready, didn't you?

678
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:20,450
- And I was.

679
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:22,870
But the army only left me with two men.

680
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,170
What do you want me to do?

681
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:27,600
I only have the Mexicans and you.

682
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,420
- And when our peons are scared,

683
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,090
you can't get them to take any action.

684
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:33,040
- But with more gold you might.

685
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,430
- No, Jose.

686
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:35,623
No, that's not it.

687
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:42,490
When a man is afraid, more gold

688
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:44,650
will not give him more courage.

689
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:45,800
- You're right, Father.

690
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:50,170
And the only way we're
ever going to get Warner

691
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,737
is to provoke him,
challenge him man-to-man.

692
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,730
- What do you mean?

693
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:00,210
- No man can swallow an open
insult in broad daylight

694
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:01,913
and ever be respected again.

695
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,530
I'm going out and brand him.

696
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:05,713
- I'll go.
- Not you.

697
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,210
- No.

698
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,550
You're not going anywhere.

699
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:10,500
Neither one of you.

700
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:12,243
- Father.

701
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:15,414
Don't force me to disobey
you, it may become a habit.

702
00:44:15,414 --> 00:44:17,777
(bell tolling)

703
00:44:17,777 --> 00:44:20,610
(rooster crowing)

704
00:44:40,892 --> 00:44:45,892
(people laughing)
(light music)

705
00:44:57,436 --> 00:44:58,269
- Whew.

706
00:44:59,307 --> 00:45:00,140
What's going on?

707
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,170
There ain't a living soul in town.

708
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:03,770
- They're all home hiding under the bed.

709
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:05,130
You ought to do the same, mister.

710
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:05,985
- Hey?

711
00:45:05,985 --> 00:45:08,050
- This whole joint's been reserved for us.

712
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:10,210
- I don't care, I come
for a shot of liquor.

713
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,300
And I got my rights to drink
under the Constitution,

714
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,340
you know.
- Ah.

715
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,550
A man's constitutional
rights are another thing.

716
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:16,383
- Hey, Max!

717
00:45:17,904 --> 00:45:19,754
- There's your constitutional rights!

718
00:45:21,295 --> 00:45:22,141
Now git!

719
00:45:22,141 --> 00:45:24,974
(people laughing)

720
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:32,620
- Who told you that I need men?

721
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:33,453
- He did.

722
00:45:33,453 --> 00:45:34,630
Sam's his name.

723
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:35,830
- Where are you from, huh?

724
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:37,770
- I'm a drummer out of Santa Fe.

725
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,660
But the recruiters tried to sign me on

726
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,600
and so I picked up and ran.

727
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,180
I'm not prepared to take their commands.

728
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,683
- Well, with me, you
have to know how to obey.

729
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:50,600
Get out.

730
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,433
- Now look, Warner, I-

731
00:45:51,433 --> 00:45:54,167
- All those who ride with
us gotta obey their orders.

732
00:45:56,114 --> 00:45:59,665
(cheerful saloon music)

733
00:45:59,665 --> 00:46:01,899
- And you, what's your work?

734
00:46:01,899 --> 00:46:03,280
- I'm a professional gambler.

735
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,450
- You'll have a real rough
time trying to euchre us.

736
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:07,833
- Couldn't I be one of ya?

737
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,853
- What do I need a gambler for?

738
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,120
- I'm handy as a gunman.

739
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,410
I put three in the graveyard.

740
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:17,913
- Shot in the back, I suppose.

741
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,890
He'd betray his mother for a centaro.

742
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:21,723
- I swear-

743
00:46:21,723 --> 00:46:22,556
- Don't swear.

744
00:46:23,761 --> 00:46:24,911
Lock him up till we go.

745
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:38,483
All right.

746
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,478
What is it you wanna say, huh?

747
00:46:42,478 --> 00:46:46,120
- First of all, don't try to treat me

748
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,162
like you did the others.

749
00:46:48,162 --> 00:46:48,995
- Mister.

750
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:51,633
He's a dangerous man.

751
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:55,930
- Yeah?

752
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:56,763
Look, Warner.

753
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:00,150
I know what you are, and
I'd like to join you.

754
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:03,910
I'm not an idiot or a swindler,

755
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:05,623
but I've been everything else.

756
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,300
If you want to accept me, fine.

757
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,330
If not, we haven't said a word.

758
00:47:13,254 --> 00:47:16,430
(John chuckles)

759
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:17,640
- What do you say?

760
00:47:19,259 --> 00:47:20,731
(men grunting)

761
00:47:20,731 --> 00:47:21,856
(guns click)

762
00:47:21,856 --> 00:47:24,439
(all laughing)

763
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:42,130
- I can tell, you are as
fast with your pistols

764
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:43,820
as with your jaw.

765
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,510
- Listen, Warner.

766
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:48,223
We're going to understand each other.

767
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:50,403
Tell him never to do that again with me.

768
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,783
- Take it easy.

769
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:57,143
We two are gonna understand each other.

770
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:05,733
But don't you ever talk
to me like you just did.

771
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,283
Never!

772
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:11,453
Get it?

773
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:14,573
- Yes, I do.

774
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,930
- The place of Morton is filled.

775
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:20,893
- Poor old Morton.

776
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,010
He wasn't bad company
at all, but he smelled.

777
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:27,503
- Boys, let's drink to the new man.

778
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,860
- Hey, what's your name?

779
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:33,878
- They call me El Guadalupano.

780
00:48:33,878 --> 00:48:35,320
- Guadalupano?

781
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,820
I know a pretty song by
the same name. (laughing)

782
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:39,630
- I wouldn't advise anyone to sing it.

783
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:40,518
Least of all you!

784
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:42,220
(glass shatters)

785
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,053
- Hold it!

786
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:44,640
I don't want a fight.

787
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,100
He's one of us.

788
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:46,933
Now.

789
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,740
That makes six again.

790
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,720
We're six again, like bullets and a gun.

791
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,871
Let's celebrate!

792
00:48:54,871 --> 00:48:57,050
(men cheering)

793
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:59,173
- Hey kid, what are you doing here?

794
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:02,180
- Is there a man called Warner here?

795
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,013
- I am.

796
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:05,943
What do you want?

797
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,823
- There's a man looking for you outside.

798
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:09,830
- Who is it?

799
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:11,350
Who's with the man?

800
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:12,310
- He was alone.

801
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:13,250
He's a stranger.

802
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:14,083
- Leave him be.

803
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:23,070
What did he say?

804
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,923
- He said that he had a
bullet to put in your head.

805
00:49:25,923 --> 00:49:28,120
(ominous music)

806
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:28,953
- Hold it.

807
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,530
Didn't you hear?

808
00:49:34,244 --> 00:49:36,327
It's me he's waiting for.

809
00:49:43,907 --> 00:49:46,907
(suspenseful music)

810
00:50:22,523 --> 00:50:25,440
(knocking on door)

811
00:50:31,874 --> 00:50:32,707
(Juanita gasps)

812
00:50:32,707 --> 00:50:34,939
(Juanita screams)

813
00:50:34,939 --> 00:50:37,689
(dramatic music)

814
00:50:47,926 --> 00:50:50,509
(rock banging)

815
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:58,583
(dramatic music)

816
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,930
- I'll bet old Sandoval's
bit off more'n he can chew.

817
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:27,787
- You got money to put up?

818
00:51:27,787 --> 00:51:30,537
(dramatic music)

819
00:52:31,502 --> 00:52:34,085
(wind howling)

820
00:52:47,975 --> 00:52:50,475
(tense music)

821
00:53:18,388 --> 00:53:19,374
- Sandoval!

822
00:53:19,374 --> 00:53:20,207
- [Echo] Sandoval!

823
00:53:20,207 --> 00:53:21,090
Sandoval!

824
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:23,950
- I hope for your sake
you're really alone.

825
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,820
- I have never broken my word.

826
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:26,908
- [Echo] Broken my word.

827
00:53:26,908 --> 00:53:29,408
(tense music)

828
00:54:06,813 --> 00:54:09,010
(gunshot bangs)

829
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:10,917
- You're a liar, Sandoval!

830
00:54:10,917 --> 00:54:13,667
- [Echo] You're a liar, Sandoval!

831
00:54:20,277 --> 00:54:22,477
- Thank God we got here
in time to help you.

832
00:54:24,173 --> 00:54:25,170
- Why!

833
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:26,130
Why?!

834
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:27,363
I gave my word!

835
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,650
- But I couldn't let him kill you

836
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:31,200
just like he killed poor Pablo.

837
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:38,733
- I'm sorry, my boy.

838
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,373
You spoiled my only chance
of killing him myself.

839
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:46,780
- Well, gentlemen.

840
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:50,963
This says you represent
the inhabitants of Rincon,

841
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:57,270
El Paso, Laredo, Austin,
Santa Fe, and Los Sadros.

842
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,830
I believe this is the first
time a Confederate Army

843
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:06,350
has been host to such a committee.

844
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:07,750
Well.

845
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:08,583
Gentlemen.

846
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,353
What is it?

847
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:14,370
- We're ranchers, General, and the people

848
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:16,150
we speak to are ranchers.

849
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:18,940
So I'd simply better say we've
come for your help, General.

850
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,890
- I know.

851
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:20,790
You want soldiers.

852
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:24,010
Have you forgotten we're at war?

853
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:25,600
- No, we haven't forgotten.

854
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,450
But our grazing lands
are occupied by outlaws.

855
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,320
By one of your men especially.

856
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,253
It's your duty to help us.

857
00:55:32,253 --> 00:55:34,240
(man mumbling)

858
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,410
- But why not manage your own defenses?

859
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:39,673
- Whatever there was to be done,
Lieutenant, we tried to do.

860
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:44,223
And we paid with our own blood, General.

861
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:48,470
No, gentlemen.

862
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,903
We are dealing with professional gunmen.

863
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:55,850
And now we are about to
lose our herds of cattle.

864
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:58,150
Do you know what that means, sir?

865
00:55:58,150 --> 00:55:58,983
It means that-

866
00:55:58,983 --> 00:56:01,490
- Yeah, to defend your cattle
you need a full brigade.

867
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:03,610
- If it hasn't occurred
to you, Lieutenant,

868
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:07,123
your army needs our
cattle to win your war.

869
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:12,653
What do you think, General?

870
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:18,733
- I'm ready to allow you
one squadron of cavalry.

871
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,093
On one condition.

872
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:24,990
And that is you support our soldiers

873
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:26,670
with all the local men you can.

874
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,621
- My sons and I will be the
first to volunteer, sir.

875
00:56:30,621 --> 00:56:32,093
- They have cavalry men!

876
00:56:32,093 --> 00:56:35,010
(triumphant music)

877
00:56:41,627 --> 00:56:44,460
(people cheering)

878
00:57:11,777 --> 00:57:12,840
- Now we're really important.

879
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:13,860
See that?

880
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:16,250
That's called a military honor guard.

881
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,773
- You better not ride near it.

882
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:21,130
- Are you scared of those uniforms?

883
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:22,130
- Of course I ain't.

884
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:25,580
It's Warner who scares me
when I'm put out in the open

885
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:26,780
for a crack at Sandoval.

886
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,600
And I'm beginning to think about me.

887
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:32,700
- Hey soldier.

888
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:33,533
Bring my horse.

889
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,420
- I gotta talk to the commanding officer.

890
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,253
- What about?

891
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,248
- Tell him I know where
he can find John Warner.

892
00:57:52,248 --> 00:57:54,748
(tense music)

893
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:00,830
There in that first building.

894
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:02,230
- What makes you think that's where

895
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:04,730
Sandoval stores his gold, One-Eye?

896
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:06,930
- Because it ain't
likely anybody'd suspect.

897
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,070
- That's a good guess.

898
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,810
- No one's guarding the place.

899
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:12,740
Does it make sense to you?

900
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:15,350
- Every place we've been
lately, you're sure suspicious.

901
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:17,000
That ain't gonna get you nothin'.

902
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:20,480
- Well, you have to be right once.

903
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,383
You ride ahead.

904
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:24,590
Go on.

905
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:25,450
Ride out.

906
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:26,810
- Alone?

907
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:27,643
- You heard me.

908
00:58:28,997 --> 00:58:31,809
(tense music)

909
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:36,809
Go on.

910
00:58:47,612 --> 00:58:50,195
(wind howling)

911
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,600
(tense music)

912
00:59:04,384 --> 00:59:05,217
Let's go.

913
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,089
- Hold your fire!

914
00:59:37,089 --> 00:59:37,922
It's me!

915
00:59:39,267 --> 00:59:43,150
(gunshot bangs)
(One-Eye grunts)

916
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:45,902
(fanfare trumpeting)

917
00:59:45,902 --> 00:59:46,770
(horses neighing)

918
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:47,603
- Whoa.

919
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:50,873
Ha!

920
00:59:50,873 --> 00:59:53,880
(dramatic music)

921
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,070
- One-Eyed Buzzard, ambush me, will ya?

922
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:56,903
- Shut up and vamos.

923
00:59:56,903 --> 00:59:58,000
You'll need your breath.

924
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,000
(gunshots banging)
(dramatic music)

925
01:01:11,048 --> 01:01:11,881
There's the border.

926
01:01:11,881 --> 01:01:13,310
All right, spit up.

927
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:15,436
We'll meet at the hideout!

928
01:01:15,436 --> 01:01:18,353
(gunshots banging)

929
01:01:24,885 --> 01:01:26,868
(horse neighing)

930
01:01:26,868 --> 01:01:27,701
- Hold!

931
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:35,893
Damn their souls.

932
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,243
Now they're into Mexico.

933
01:01:46,143 --> 01:01:49,060
(insects chirping)

934
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,380
- It's done, patron.

935
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:01,210
- That's fine, Manuel.

936
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:03,790
The cattle will soon
be here for the water.

937
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:04,623
- Bueno.

938
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:15,693
- Father!

939
01:02:18,905 --> 01:02:19,738
Father!

940
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:23,103
Father!

941
01:02:24,942 --> 01:02:26,942
(solemn music)

942
01:02:26,942 --> 01:02:28,025
Juan escaped.

943
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:32,570
Are you listening?

944
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,863
- Yes, I'm listening.

945
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:38,960
- You know it.

946
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:39,793
Don't you?

947
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,610
I knew it, it was the
fault of that army captain.

948
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:48,910
He should have told us that he
was going out after the gang.

949
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:50,240
I'm sure that if...

950
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,390
- What are you sure of?

951
01:02:52,745 --> 01:02:55,800
- That Warner would never
have escaped that way

952
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,950
unless he was the son of a demon.

953
01:02:57,950 --> 01:02:59,193
- Or at least a friend.

954
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:04,360
'Cause that kind of luck can
only come from the devil.

955
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,170
- In Mexico now.

956
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:08,063
But why didn't they just tell us?

957
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:10,710
- Maybe it's better that way.

958
01:03:11,761 --> 01:03:15,210
I don't think I could stand
to lose him a second time.

959
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:17,320
- What are we going to do?

960
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:18,560
Tell me that.

961
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:19,760
What are we going to do?

962
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,073
- We're going to wait.

963
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:29,937
And someday, when his luck abandons him,

964
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:35,250
on that day, wherever he is...

965
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:37,093
We'll meet.

966
01:03:38,097 --> 01:03:39,940
Face to face.

967
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:48,560
You see that?

968
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,213
The old wheel is working again.

969
01:03:59,389 --> 01:04:01,889
(tense music)

970
01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:32,460
- Not even a drop of tequila.

971
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:38,380
I'm sick and tired of
hearing those damn frogs

972
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:39,863
croaking all night.

973
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:44,060
- They're making music, brother.

974
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:45,610
- Don't ever call me brother.

975
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:46,470
I'm no one's brother.

976
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:48,690
I don't even know who my father was.

977
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:51,350
- Then I should say maybe
we're both blood brothers.

978
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:53,220
- You filthy peyote.
- Hold it.

979
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,803
What's wrong with you two?

980
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,233
I'm tired of your fighting all the time.

981
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:01,153
- I would say he's kind of nervous.

982
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:10,673
Hmm.

983
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,361
- At least you've still got a steady hand.

984
01:05:14,361 --> 01:05:17,111
(frogs trilling)

985
01:05:20,413 --> 01:05:22,713
- What the hell has
happened to Lucky and Sam?

986
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,980
- Three days is a long time.

987
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:27,960
Let's hope they weren't caught.

988
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,912
- They went straight North.

989
01:05:29,912 --> 01:05:31,562
They have to cross the mountains.

990
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:35,780
Why don't you relax?

991
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:37,260
Stop acting like a wolf in a cage.

992
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:39,640
Go to the pueblo and
get us food and whiskey.

993
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,223
- Now that's a great idea.

994
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,117
- Hey, Guadalupano.

995
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:48,710
If you want to get drunk,
wait till you get back, eh?

996
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:50,970
- Oh, don't worry, John.

997
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:53,860
- Hey, don't be tempted
by the poor (indistinct)

998
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:55,003
into sin, brother.

999
01:05:55,890 --> 01:05:56,723
- Shut up.

1000
01:05:57,566 --> 01:05:58,433
Priest.

1001
01:06:02,672 --> 01:06:05,255
(gentle music)

1002
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:22,910
- Ah, anyone here?

1003
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:24,640
- Why yes, I am.

1004
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,679
- Ah, a little dove.

1005
01:06:26,679 --> 01:06:28,179
Come here, pronto.

1006
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:30,090
- All right.

1007
01:06:38,354 --> 01:06:41,687
(Guadalupano whistling)

1008
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:45,790
- Oh, you have a pretty bird call.

1009
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:48,420
- Maybe I put you in a cage.

1010
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:51,340
- You don't want to
scare little bird, hmm?

1011
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,283
- I want to buy.

1012
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:57,280
There's plenty of goods for sale, hmm?

1013
01:06:58,990 --> 01:06:59,933
- Maybe.

1014
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:03,890
The goods that are most expensive...

1015
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:08,812
I wouldn't sell to just anyone.

1016
01:07:08,812 --> 01:07:10,443
- To just any (indistinct), eh?

1017
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:16,203
You are able to tell a
gentlemen, aren't you?

1018
01:07:34,359 --> 01:07:35,383
- That's a good one.

1019
01:07:35,383 --> 01:07:37,133
Where did you get it?

1020
01:07:39,343 --> 01:07:40,243
- From a fool.

1021
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:44,546
He says he has lots of them.

1022
01:07:44,546 --> 01:07:46,390
- He still here?

1023
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:47,693
- He left a minute ago.

1024
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:49,683
He was alone.

1025
01:07:50,705 --> 01:07:51,538
- Vamos.

1026
01:07:56,311 --> 01:07:59,561
(Guadalupano laughing)

1027
01:08:06,308 --> 01:08:10,975
(Guadalupano speaking foreign language)

1028
01:08:12,831 --> 01:08:15,581
(frogs trilling)

1029
01:08:23,626 --> 01:08:25,780
(banging on door)

1030
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:26,726
- [Guadalupano] It's me.

1031
01:08:26,726 --> 01:08:28,608
El Guadalupano.

1032
01:08:28,608 --> 01:08:30,176
Open up.

1033
01:08:30,176 --> 01:08:32,189
Open up, pronto.

1034
01:08:32,189 --> 01:08:33,022
Hombre.

1035
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:41,241
- Good time?

1036
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:44,077
(Guadalupano mumbling)

1037
01:08:44,077 --> 01:08:48,360
And next time, better still. (laughing)

1038
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:50,343
- I told you not to drink.

1039
01:08:52,193 --> 01:08:55,263
- By the virgin, I swear
I didn't touch a drop.

1040
01:08:56,148 --> 01:08:59,065
(gunshots banging)

1041
01:09:24,131 --> 01:09:26,798
(ominous music)

1042
01:09:38,847 --> 01:09:41,893
(gun clicks)

1043
01:09:41,893 --> 01:09:44,643
(dramatic music)

1044
01:09:48,488 --> 01:09:51,238
(birds chirping)

1045
01:09:57,266 --> 01:09:59,099
- Where's Guadalupano?

1046
01:10:00,593 --> 01:10:02,580
- He was bushwhacked.

1047
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:03,473
Don't dismount.

1048
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:06,080
We're leaving.

1049
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,120
It ain't safe here anymore.

1050
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,720
- But we can't go back to Texas.

1051
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:13,143
- Then we just stay in Mexico.

1052
01:10:13,143 --> 01:10:14,903
- Sandoval's gonna laugh at us.

1053
01:10:19,610 --> 01:10:20,743
- Let him laugh.

1054
01:10:22,330 --> 01:10:23,240
For now.

1055
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:26,250
- Then all that you have
done is completely useless.

1056
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:27,910
- Our mission was to
clear this area of bandits

1057
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:29,070
and we accomplished that.

1058
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:33,560
- Yes, by hanging some poor
unfortunate damned fools.

1059
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,630
But you didn't catch John Warner.

1060
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:38,410
- Now it's a problem for
the authorities in Mexico.

1061
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:39,860
Warner'll never come back here.

1062
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:42,670
- I can see you don't
know your man, Captain.

1063
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:44,130
He'll be back soon.

1064
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:45,611
As soon as you go so we go.

1065
01:10:45,611 --> 01:10:48,111
(tense music)

1066
01:11:00,233 --> 01:11:03,183
- So we go back to living
with rifles all about us.

1067
01:11:06,106 --> 01:11:07,740
And help ourselves.

1068
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:09,650
- You're wrong, my boy.

1069
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:11,750
This time we'll take the initiative.

1070
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:13,920
This time we'll go after him.

1071
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:14,793
- To Mexico?

1072
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:18,960
- Have you forgotten
that we go to the fiesta

1073
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,313
at Condalari every year?

1074
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:23,683
As soon as he finds out, he'll come.

1075
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:26,580
- I'm sure you're right, Father.

1076
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:29,860
But who do you suppose will
come to our help if he does?

1077
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:32,193
- Have you forgotten Colonel Gonzales?

1078
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:36,513
And that I made him governor of Chihuahua.

1079
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,350
- It's not very flattering, really.

1080
01:11:41,203 --> 01:11:43,970
And it's such a pity,
because they have put it

1081
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:45,450
all around the state, you know?

1082
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:46,283
- Yeah.

1083
01:11:47,290 --> 01:11:48,640
Where did you get that one?

1084
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:51,880
- I told you.

1085
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,623
My dear husband brought it.

1086
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:57,513
And (indistinct) far better than you.

1087
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:00,833
That shows how little he can judge a man.

1088
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:03,910
He can't see anything.

1089
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:06,463
- But you do, that's certain.

1090
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:16,073
- You are sad?

1091
01:12:17,272 --> 01:12:18,105
- Mm-mm.

1092
01:12:20,330 --> 01:12:24,913
Isa, you're more dangerous than a puma.

1093
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:27,293
Really?

1094
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:29,323
But why not?

1095
01:12:30,254 --> 01:12:31,823
You like us fierce.

1096
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:45,679
I need you.

1097
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:48,287
You're the only man I've ever wanted.

1098
01:12:48,287 --> 01:12:51,530
Why can't you escape to
Europe and stay with me?

1099
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:52,850
I'll pay everything.

1100
01:12:52,850 --> 01:12:53,793
You'll be rich.

1101
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:01,010
- And what would you tell your husband,

1102
01:13:02,470 --> 01:13:05,563
his excellency, the governor of Chihuahua?

1103
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:10,180
Whose dream is to see
me hanging from a rope.

1104
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:11,013
Hmm?

1105
01:13:13,410 --> 01:13:14,810
- I was being serious, John.

1106
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:16,853
- Me too.

1107
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,163
I'm not easy to domesticate.

1108
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,531
- But that's your appeal, you know.

1109
01:13:31,531 --> 01:13:32,513
I like it.

1110
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:36,770
Not here.

1111
01:13:36,770 --> 01:13:39,103
Besides, there's a
chance you could change.

1112
01:13:43,557 --> 01:13:44,390
Well.

1113
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:59,682
(gentle music)

1114
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:27,133
There's no reason to be hasty.

1115
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:30,523
I'll be yours all night long.

1116
01:14:33,183 --> 01:14:37,660
Pablito went to Candelaria,
and there he will attend

1117
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:40,713
the man he owes his post as governor to.

1118
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:50,113
- I'm beginning to like that guy.

1119
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:52,003
- I'm not.

1120
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:56,374
And I'm sure you would
loathe Pedro Sandoval.

1121
01:14:56,374 --> 01:14:58,500
(dramatic music)

1122
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,333
- Sandoval.

1123
01:15:00,169 --> 01:15:05,169
(upbeat music)
(children laughing)

1124
01:15:35,857 --> 01:15:38,050
- Ah, buenas dias, Senor Governador.

1125
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:40,050
What an honor to have you with us again.

1126
01:15:41,038 --> 01:15:42,360
- Where's Senor Sandoval?

1127
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,210
- He has not come down yet.

1128
01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:45,053
Excuse me.

1129
01:15:50,568 --> 01:15:52,400
- Where's your brother?

1130
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,450
- He's coming.

1131
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:55,213
He'll be in time for the procession.

1132
01:15:56,770 --> 01:15:58,093
- Something bothering you?

1133
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:01,170
- Father.

1134
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:02,870
I keep thinking about John Warner.

1135
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:05,413
- Me too, me too.

1136
01:16:06,627 --> 01:16:07,460
(knocking on door)

1137
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:08,293
Come in.

1138
01:16:09,301 --> 01:16:10,391
(speaking foreign language)

1139
01:16:10,391 --> 01:16:11,970
Good morning, good morning.

1140
01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:13,365
- I trust you have slept well?

1141
01:16:13,365 --> 01:16:14,530
(speaking foreign language)

1142
01:16:14,530 --> 01:16:15,950
- We were speaking of Warner, Governor.

1143
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:18,800
I doubt if he'll come.
- Patience, patience.

1144
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,480
He knows we're here.

1145
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,800
He'll come after the bait soon enough.

1146
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,760
- But I don't like them using you as bait.

1147
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:26,200
- Oh I am more than ready to answer

1148
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,030
for our security measures.

1149
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:31,357
There are soldiers even in the
bell tower of the cathedral.

1150
01:16:31,357 --> 01:16:33,870
I'll guard your father
as I would my own life.

1151
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:36,920
- I know, but Warner's already
escaped you more than once.

1152
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:39,793
- I took it upon myself to
order extra precautions today.

1153
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:42,763
- Ah, Jose.

1154
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:46,490
You're gonna be late for the procession.

1155
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:48,643
- I'm not going.

1156
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:51,230
I'll stay with you, Father.

1157
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:53,780
- But you must go.

1158
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:55,660
You are the president of your group.

1159
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:57,310
The governor was looking for you.

1160
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:01,290
- What about you?

1161
01:17:01,290 --> 01:17:03,930
- Well, Francisco and I,
we're going to pick out

1162
01:17:03,930 --> 01:17:05,520
the bulls for the (indistinct).

1163
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,683
Now don't worry, we'll be all right.

1164
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:12,910
- When you're ready, Colonel.

1165
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,150
I'll see you later.

1166
01:17:19,607 --> 01:17:23,274
(speaking foreign language)

1167
01:17:24,814 --> 01:17:27,397
(solemn music)

1168
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:46,000
- He's gone to the bull
ring to select the toros.

1169
01:17:48,190 --> 01:17:49,090
- Do they know it?

1170
01:17:49,933 --> 01:17:51,093
- Yeah, si.

1171
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:54,653
What do we do?

1172
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,153
Appears that we are expected.

1173
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,757
- We go right ahead.

1174
01:18:00,757 --> 01:18:03,257
(tense music)

1175
01:18:18,077 --> 01:18:20,140
- And this is their tragic end.

1176
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:22,609
So death came to the beautiful Rafaela

1177
01:18:22,609 --> 01:18:24,210
and the wicked Shogun.

1178
01:18:24,210 --> 01:18:25,657
And so it will for all those who are

1179
01:18:25,657 --> 01:18:27,760
in league with the demon.

1180
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:31,427
(speaking foreign language)

1181
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:36,190
- It's Pablo, your cousin who robbed you

1182
01:18:36,190 --> 01:18:37,350
and abandoned the priesthood.

1183
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:38,800
- Why, that's who it is.

1184
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,790
- They say he joined a band of gringos,

1185
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:43,640
and there's a reward offering
(indistinct) in gold.

1186
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:46,393
- No, Pica, I can't do that to my cousin.

1187
01:18:46,393 --> 01:18:48,940
- A bandit's only cousin is the devil.

1188
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:49,773
Do as I say.

1189
01:18:51,234 --> 01:18:52,648
Think about your Marco.

1190
01:18:52,648 --> 01:18:54,868
(speaking foreign language)

1191
01:18:54,868 --> 01:18:59,868
(gentle music)
(fireworks whistling)

1192
01:19:23,710 --> 01:19:26,210
(tense music)

1193
01:19:31,515 --> 01:19:34,682
(fireworks crackling)

1194
01:19:41,438 --> 01:19:43,938
(tense music)

1195
01:19:46,696 --> 01:19:51,696
(gentle music)
(fireworks crackling)

1196
01:19:52,635 --> 01:19:55,135
(tense music)

1197
01:19:58,285 --> 01:20:03,022
(gentle music)
(fireworks whistling)

1198
01:20:03,022 --> 01:20:05,522
(tense music)

1199
01:20:50,114 --> 01:20:53,114
(suspenseful music)

1200
01:21:02,446 --> 01:21:07,446
(gentle music)
(fireworks crackling)

1201
01:21:08,546 --> 01:21:11,546
(suspenseful music)

1202
01:21:21,813 --> 01:21:26,813
(gentle music)
(fireworks crackling)

1203
01:21:27,662 --> 01:21:30,430
(suspenseful music)

1204
01:21:30,430 --> 01:21:34,730
- There is a fiesta in town
and we draw sentry duty here.

1205
01:21:34,730 --> 01:21:37,568
- Well, that means we see
the parida without paying.

1206
01:21:37,568 --> 01:21:40,010
- Yes, but standing in the sun.

1207
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:42,512
I had a ticket for the shade.

1208
01:21:42,512 --> 01:21:43,710
- Halto!

1209
01:21:43,710 --> 01:21:45,660
- Hey, lower your guns, amigos.

1210
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:48,240
I have a message for Senor Sandoval.

1211
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,490
- We have orders to admit no one.

1212
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:52,221
- It's an urgent message.

1213
01:21:52,221 --> 01:21:55,221
(Sandoval laughing)

1214
01:21:56,258 --> 01:21:58,224
(speaking foreign language)

1215
01:21:58,224 --> 01:22:00,545
(cow lowing)

1216
01:22:00,545 --> 01:22:01,545
- Toro, huh?

1217
01:22:02,394 --> 01:22:03,726
(man laughing)

1218
01:22:03,726 --> 01:22:04,559
Hey, toro.

1219
01:22:05,524 --> 01:22:08,024
(cows lowing)

1220
01:22:11,810 --> 01:22:14,810
(suspenseful music)

1221
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:25,590
- You're a little late.

1222
01:22:26,810 --> 01:22:28,313
- I think so too.

1223
01:22:29,158 --> 01:22:30,810
- Careful, boy.

1224
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:33,850
- Tell your men to leave my boy alone.

1225
01:22:33,850 --> 01:22:35,543
- I came for you alone.

1226
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:37,943
- Here I am, gringo.

1227
01:23:12,573 --> 01:23:15,323
(dramatic music)

1228
01:23:50,369 --> 01:23:51,950
- I want to see your captain.

1229
01:23:51,950 --> 01:23:54,700
(dramatic music)

1230
01:24:33,641 --> 01:24:34,813
- Toro!

1231
01:24:34,813 --> 01:24:36,023
Toro!

1232
01:24:36,023 --> 01:24:36,856
Toro!

1233
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:47,206
- Here, give me your hand.

1234
01:25:12,302 --> 01:25:13,314
(Sandoval grunts)

1235
01:25:13,314 --> 01:25:14,147
- Father!

1236
01:25:16,868 --> 01:25:19,868
(Sandoval groaning)

1237
01:25:57,687 --> 01:25:58,520
Father!

1238
01:26:04,912 --> 01:26:07,495
(bell tolling)

1239
01:26:17,333 --> 01:26:18,166
- Move out.

1240
01:26:18,166 --> 01:26:20,666
(cows lowing)

1241
01:26:32,705 --> 01:26:35,622
(gunshots banging)

1242
01:26:46,906 --> 01:26:47,739
(Sam grunts)

1243
01:26:47,739 --> 01:26:50,656
(gunshots banging)

1244
01:27:17,049 --> 01:27:17,882
- Jose!

1245
01:27:18,894 --> 01:27:20,939
Favorite of our father!

1246
01:27:20,939 --> 01:27:23,856
(gunshots banging)

1247
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:30,599
(man grunts)
(gunshots banging)

1248
01:27:30,599 --> 01:27:32,466
(man grunts)

1249
01:27:32,466 --> 01:27:35,216
(dramatic music)

1250
01:28:27,610 --> 01:28:28,723
- Say your prayers.

1251
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:30,830
It's the end of us.

1252
01:28:32,538 --> 01:28:35,371
(Lucky whistling)

1253
01:28:42,263 --> 01:28:44,189
- You can't escape, Warner.

1254
01:28:44,189 --> 01:28:45,839
Throw down your weapons.

1255
01:28:45,839 --> 01:28:47,506
- Come and get them.

1256
01:28:50,798 --> 01:28:53,715
(gunshots banging)

1257
01:28:59,763 --> 01:29:02,763
(suspenseful music)

1258
01:29:18,155 --> 01:29:20,738
(solemn music)
