PARIS MEMORIES

4
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,879
Shit!

5
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:25,680
Prep her for surgery.
I'll be there at 7:30.

6
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,439
Make a start.

7
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,639
Hey.

8
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,039
No, I'm here.
What's the patient's name?

9
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,120
Okay, explain the situation.

10
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,520
There, kitty.
Just there.

11
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,159
- Hi.
- Started.

12
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,680
Hi.

13
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,840
- Mic test?
- Sure.

14
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,719
<i>In ten seconds, Patricia's
introduction. Then 1st question.</i>

15
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,719
All right.

16
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,319
Three... Two...

17
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,479
One. And go.

18
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,840
<i>Live from Moscow, this morning's
guest Dmitri Vassiliev,</i>

19
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,000
the controversial Russian director,

20
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,040
who opens the Paris Opera's season

21
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,360
<i>with The Snow Maiden
by Rimsky-Korsakov.</i>

22
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,360
Dmitri Vassiliev, good morning.

23
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,759
Morning.

24
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:27,279
<i>You are famous
for bold, political productions.</i>

25
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,319
<i>You bore the wrath
of the Russian authorities.</i>

26
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,720
<i>Will you soften your approach
to avoid shocking Paris audiences,</i>

27
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,560
known to be very conservative?

28
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,680
No, not at all.

29
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,079
France is home
of the Revolution and tolerance.

30
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,959
I think it'll be fine.

31
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,360
I always dreamed
of directing in Paris.

32
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,879
It has a very special place
in my heart.

33
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,879
- Evening. A table for two?
- Yes.

34
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:19,720
Next week, change of mood.
An aeronautical trade show.

35
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,319
- Gotta bone up on aviation.
- Such as?

36
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,560
Such as...

37
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,759
Which means?

38
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,079
Development
of nanostructured materials.

39
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,240
Sorry.

40
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,600
Be right back.
Yes?

41
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,439
You gave me a fright.

42
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,600
All good?

43
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,120
Sorry, I have to go back.

44
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,800
- Right now?
- The new intern's all at sea.

45
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,319
I mean, she's new.

46
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:25,000
- Sorry.
- You're on duty?

47
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:27,079
No, but it's my department.
No choice.

48
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,040
- What will you do?
- I don't know now.

49
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,680
Go home?

50
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,319
Yeah.

51
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,319
See you later?

52
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:38,160
I won't be long.
I'll call when I'm done.

53
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,519
Good luck.

54
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,800
Later.

55
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,759
Just a drink until it blows over?

56
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:04,879
That table's reserved.
There's one in the next room.

57
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,120
Right there?

58
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,839
- That's right.
- Thanks.

59
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,920
- The other room's that way?
- Yes, down there on the right.

60
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,439
Thanks.

61
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Evening!

62
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,240
- Is that free?
- Sure, take a seat.

63
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,200
Go ahead.

64
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,559
What happened next?

65
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,720
It's erased from my memory.

66
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,519
On track but the scar needs
to stabilize before we can operate.

67
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,840
You can get dressed.

68
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,080
It's closed up nicely, though.

69
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:06,559
I'd like to be able to move on.

70
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,360
In 6-7 months, we can decide
for plastic surgery.

71
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:12,480
For now, it's too inflammatory.

72
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,720
7 months? All right.

73
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,519
But we can...

74
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,240
get rid of it?

75
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,159
We'll do our best
but we're not magicians.

76
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,679
- You haven't gone back to work?
- No.

77
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,399
Not yet but soon. I...

78
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,720
I was out of town, at my mother's.

79
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,679
It's good to be back.

80
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,519
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
due to roadworks,</i>

81
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,639
we'll make a change of route.

82
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:33,720
Can you open the doors, please?

83
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:33,679
The bathroom's that way.

84
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,960
Not the bathroom...

85
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,480
Okay, I see.

86
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,240
Get in touch with the group
that organizes visits every...

87
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,799
Every Monday morning.

88
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,440
For folks who...

89
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,240
Folks like you.

90
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,559
Folks like me, meaning?

91
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:58,360
Victims who need to see the scene.

92
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,120
They talk. It's important apparently.
We stay closed.

93
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,200
It's business as usual now,
you understand?

94
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,080
A coffee, perhaps?

95
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:11,519
Yes, please.

96
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,039
On the house.

97
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:46,639
- You stayed at your mother's?
- Yeah, three months in all.

98
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,559
When you didn't answer my messages,
I figured...

99
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,879
Maybe you're not ready to talk...

100
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,279
I mean,
I won't ask for all the details.

101
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,440
It's tricky knowing what to talk about.

102
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,759
Will you take the cake in for me?

103
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,799
- Yes, sure. You okay?
- Fine.

104
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,519
All good. I'll get the...

105
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,440
champagne glasses.

106
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,319
See you in there.

107
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,079
Okay, kitty?

108
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:47,319
- There you are.
- It's you.

109
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,519
Just taking five.

110
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
In the dark.

111
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:56,839
- With the bottles.
- You can't stay there.

112
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:59,640
Come on.

113
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,720
See you. It was great to see you.
On form, too. It's cool.

114
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,720
Vincent's very supportive.

115
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,400
- See you, girls.
- See you.

116
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:21,759
See you soon.

117
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,079
- Take care.
- Thanks.

118
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,519
Before, you see, people...

119
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:31,400
confided in me...

120
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,880
They opened up. I liked it.

121
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,279
Now, it's the opposite.

122
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,920
Like I'm some kind of attraction.

123
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,960
- Even you talk differently to me.
- Me? Not a bit.

124
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:49,480
You do.

125
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,319
As if I need treating with care.

126
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,599
Really? I didn't realize.

127
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,559
You can't stop people thinking
of you, though,

128
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,200
and all you went through.

129
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:03,000
Yeah.

130
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,039
Had it started raining when you left?

131
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,039
No. I mean...

132
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,680
I don't recall.

133
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,920
See? I remember clearly,
it wasn't raining. It started later.

134
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,519
Until then, I remember clearly.

135
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,960
You had to go back to the hospital?

136
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:26,880
Perhaps.

137
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,599
Yes...

138
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,440
That's right, I remember that.

139
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:11,319
<i>I'd been at the hospital for an hour
when the alarm sounded.</i>

140
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:14,960
<i>Every hospital had to cease
secondary activities</i>

141
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,519
and prepare for an influx of casualties.

142
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:20,680
Then the casualties started coming in.

143
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,960
<i>I remember the smell of gunpowder
filling the corridors.</i>

144
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,759
I called but you didn't pick up.

145
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,559
I was sure you were home already.

146
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,039
<i>Part of my job was triage.
"Most urgent" to "least urgent."</i>

147
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,519
Gunshot wounds, burns...

148
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:44,599
<i>We heard two other targets
had been hit.</i>

149
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,880
<i>It was a coordinated attack.
Every hospital was on red alert.</i>

150
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,599
Early next morning,

151
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,000
<i>I got a call from the
hospital where you'd been taken.</i>

152
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,880
You were wounded.

153
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,720
<i>They'd been unable to identify you
because you weren't talking.</i>

154
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,319
And you had no ID on you.

155
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:18,480
I went to see you.

156
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:22,480
<i>The taxi home
passed by the restaurant.</i>

157
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,960
<i>There were flowers
and children's drawings.</i>

158
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,839
<i>It was like
a corridor with people filing past.</i>

159
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,079
In silence.

160
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,759
Like a procession.

161
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,279
I'm Sara,
the support group coordinator.

162
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:04,640
Hello. I was in the attack.

163
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,359
I got that.

164
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,039
- What's your name?
- Mia.

165
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,960
All right.
Take a seat, I won't be long.

166
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:13,839
It's great that you came.

167
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:35,960
It's crucial that you sleep
and regain strength.

168
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,000
That way, your memory
will work better, too.

169
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:44,160
Once you begin to remember,
you're on the road to recovery.

170
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:45,680
You're right.

171
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:50,039
Can you sit somewhere else?

172
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
Please.

173
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:54,960
My parents sat here.

174
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,240
Sorry, I had no idea. I apologize.

175
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,480
I'll sit here.

176
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,440
- Sorry.
- Where were you sitting?

177
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,759
I was in the other room.

178
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,839
I wasn't with them on that night.

179
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,440
I'd like to know
the last words they spoke.

180
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,759
What they were talking about.

181
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,720
If they were happy just then.

182
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,079
Arguing or whatever.

183
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,039
Understand?

184
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,359
Maybe you saw them?

185
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,759
Let me show you something.

186
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:03,920
Sorry, I have to go.

187
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,480
- Leaving?
- I don't know why I came.

188
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,200
I was with someone
who's claustrophobic.

189
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,359
He can't come in but he wants a word.

190
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:18,759
Thanks.

191
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:44,720
Remember me?

192
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,240
No.

193
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,160
At the table opposite you.
Celebrating a birthday.

194
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,200
I don't remember anything.

195
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:00,039
You ordered a glass of wine.

196
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,680
As if expecting someone.

197
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:06,160
A second later, you disappeared.
There were...

198
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:08,440
some Chinese women masking you.

199
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,200
When you reappeared,
you had ink all over your hands.

200
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,400
You dug in your pockets for a tissue.

201
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,920
The more you rummaged,
the more you got ink everywhere.

202
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,519
You even got it on your face.

203
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,279
You made me laugh.

204
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,880
You were laughing at me?

205
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,000
Not at all, but you thought so.

206
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:31,160
That I was laughing at you.

207
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:32,880
You gave me a look...

208
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:34,759
Very annoyed.

209
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,359
Yes, that's right.

210
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,960
I was writing?
With a fountain pen. Was I writing?

211
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,480
I don't know. I guess.

212
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,200
What happened then?

213
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,359
Then you stood up...

214
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,680
You crossed the room...

215
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,000
To the bathroom, I suppose.

216
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:01,240
You don't remember a thing?

217
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,279
No.

218
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,759
There are gaps.
I have no recollection...

219
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,920
Hardly any. I still have...

220
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,759
images before the attack, sounds, but...

221
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:16,480
From the moment I saw people die,
it's all gone.

222
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,200
- I don't remember a thing.
- Lucky you.

223
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,319
Your car?

224
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,319
What's your name?

225
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,119
Mia.

226
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,480
- And you?
- Thomas.

227
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,559
You're allowed to drive?

228
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,079
No.

229
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,799
Come on, it's cool.
What's your problem?

230
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,640
- Shift your car.
- Shift my car? Look at my leg.

231
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:01,599
She tugged me and I think I followed.
Then I don't remember.

232
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:04,119
Back already?

233
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,759
Yes, I was talking outside with Thomas.

234
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:10,240
- Right, that's good.
- He made me remember something.

235
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,559
- I was sitting there.
- That's very good.

236
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,279
Now you can piece together the puzzle.

237
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,440
What are you doing here?

238
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,839
Sorry?

239
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:27,519
I was here, like you. I was right there.

240
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,559
Not here, not at all.

241
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:32,200
In the bathroom. I recognize you.

242
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:34,920
You bolted when the shooting started.

243
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,519
- Me?
- Yes, you.

244
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:41,079
You hid in the bathroom
and locked out everyone else.

245
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,640
You didn't open up.

246
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:46,240
How dare you come here?

247
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,400
I didn't do that.

248
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:55,319
You put your safety above all else.

249
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,480
How can you...
How can you show your face today?

250
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:01,880
Shame on you.

251
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:05,519
It's despicable, what you did.

252
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,720
What are you doing?

253
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,319
- Sorry, I have to go.
- What? Go where?

254
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,359
Home. See you there, okay?

255
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,599
- You're sure?
- Sure. I'm fine.

256
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,359
Sorry, sir...

257
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,559
Excuse me.

258
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:25,319
Hello, it's Mia.

259
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:28,799
We met at the restaurant earlier
and talked.

260
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:33,440
Perhaps you can help me.
Can you call me back?

261
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:34,759
Thanks.

262
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,640
Thanks for getting back to me.

263
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,000
I thought maybe
you could help me with...

264
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,400
Sorry.

265
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:01,799
You're sure it's no problem?

266
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,039
Hello.

267
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:29,599
- Come in.
- Sara gave me your number.

268
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,480
I'd no idea you were here.

269
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:34,279
It's all good.
I had an op scheduled today,

270
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:37,279
but most likely tomorrow morning now,
so it's fine.

271
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:39,880
I already had three surgeries.

272
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,359
They reconstruct my tibia bit by bit.

273
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,599
Honestly, it's all good.

274
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:48,160
I have bullet fragments
in my other leg.

275
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:51,839
I don't know
if I'll get that done just yet.

276
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,319
Draw out the pleasure.

277
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:56,160
I won't bore you about my leg.

278
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,640
What can I do for you?

279
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,680
Apparently, you remember
everything that happened.

280
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:05,200
Yes.

281
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:08,680
Why do you want to remember?

282
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:12,559
- I may have done something.
- Such as?

283
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,640
Nothing, I...
Sara said you remember tiny details.

284
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,759
I figured maybe you remembered
what I did after I left.

285
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:22,440
Did I come back in the room?

286
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,960
No.

287
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,079
Sit down.

288
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:36,319
I don't recall you coming back.

289
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,640
But perhaps someone saw you.

290
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,880
You checked out the website?

291
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,640
Posted on the forum?

292
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:47,440
No.
I didn't know it all existed.

293
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,200
It's a whole new world.

294
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:52,559
I want to remember.

295
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,680
You can't do it alone.

296
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,240
It takes two or more to remember.

297
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,799
I recommend you go online.

298
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,480
You know the Memoria facebook page?

299
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:08,320
Spend some time on there.

300
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,920
You'll love it, as a journalist.

301
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,280
I googled you.

302
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,079
That's all.

303
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,800
Mia Loreau. Still on the radio?

304
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,400
I do some radio work
but I'm a Russian translator.

305
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,280
A Russian translator?

306
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:31,480
- Toughie.
- My mom spoke Russian at home so...

307
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,920
Not really.

308
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,199
- Grab my cigarettes, will you?
- Of course. Here...

309
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:46,400
- You smoke here?
- No, down the hall, there's an exit.

310
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:48,440
My coat, too?

311
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,440
You didn't answer me.

312
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,920
At the restaurant...

313
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,039
You were expecting someone?

314
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:12,440
No.

315
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,679
You have any idea
why you were there?

316
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,880
Chance.

317
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,880
I wasn't there by chance.

318
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:43,639
Somebody had made a booking.

319
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:49,239
<i>It was my birthday.
We'd just got our week's bonuses.</i>

320
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,039
I'm in finance.

321
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,440
I hate celebrating my birthday.

322
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,639
But they wanted to surprise me
and I went along with it.

323
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,760
Not to offend anyone.

324
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,719
Weren't you with some girls?

325
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,599
Yes. Two coworkers.

326
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,800
They didn't make it.

327
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,159
Their families came to see me.

328
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,760
I didn't know what to say.

329
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,880
Ashamed to be there instead of them.

330
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:50,440
Got a husband?

331
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:54,760
Yes. We're not married.

332
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,480
That means you're free?

333
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,840
That's not really the idea.

334
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,480
Children?

335
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,360
No.

336
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,119
It came to mind in the attack.

337
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,639
Not having kids,
not knowing what it's like.

338
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,559
There you are!
We looked everywhere.

339
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,599
- No visitors at night, you know.
- I'm sorry.

340
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,280
Be right there.

341
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,079
Let's go.

342
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:30,679
Pull hard. Thanks.

343
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,159
- You'll be back tomorrow?
- Yes.

344
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:36,639
Good luck.

345
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,039
Arrivederci!

346
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:44,000
Bring me mandarins tomorrow.

347
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:46,000
Or oranges.

348
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,719
Or chocolate.

349
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,199
Sara gave me the police report to read.

350
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:24,679
The attack began at 8:49 pm.

351
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:27,519
The police freed us at 10:37 pm.

352
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,599
<i>We stayed hidden
for one hour 48 minutes.</i>

353
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:35,719
<i>I remembered wondering
what would be left of me after death.</i>

354
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,119
In what state I'd left things.

355
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,920
<i>I thought about a half-eaten yogurt
in the fridge.</i>

356
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,840
Hi, Vincent. It's me.

357
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,239
I won't be home.

358
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,920
Sonia's moving
and loaned me her place for a few days.

359
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,519
At République.

360
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I think I need to be alone right now.

361
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:05,559
Lots of love.

362
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:29,760
I remember that sound.

363
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:32,840
What did I do?

364
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:37,719
Where were you?

365
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,199
I was in the first room,
at the bar with a friend.

366
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:43,360
She died immediately.

367
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:46,519
I struggled
to piece things together, too.

368
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,360
It wasn't simple.

369
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,400
When we started the group,

370
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,440
I never thought
so many people needed to come back.

371
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,159
Turns out, we're all family.

372
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,239
Will you be with us tomorrow
at République?

373
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,079
Our last vigil
before they clear flowers and candles.

374
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:05,480
Yes.

375
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,400
I came to Paris to study architecture.

376
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,320
I fell in love and stayed.

377
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,800
You remember something?

378
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,079
No, sorry.

379
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:30,000
- I'm wasting your time.
- Not at all. That's why we're here.

380
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,559
You hear of the "diamond in trauma"?

381
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,239
No.

382
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,400
It's the idea that misfortune
can lead to something good.

383
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:42,199
You'll find yours, I'm sure.

384
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:47,400
- Can we try one more time?
- Of course.

385
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,920
Imagine it without all this.

386
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,159
Before, it was a storeroom,
much darker.

387
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,880
Up there, people managed to hide.

388
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,000
No, it wasn't here.

389
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:00,039
The light's changed too.

390
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:01,800
No, it's not that...

391
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,920
I remember drops of water on my hand.

392
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:08,480
The other one then. Come on.

393
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:20,840
I'll give you some light.

394
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:26,199
Was it here?

395
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,800
Yes.

396
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,760
Someone was with me.

397
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:49,119
He held my hand.

398
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:52,800
I don't remember his face
but he had a tattoo.

399
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:54,920
On his forearm.

400
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:57,159
A bloodstained apron.

401
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,719
In this area,
there were lots of kitchen staff.

402
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,800
The apron suggests he was a cook.

403
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:05,000
Lots of them died.

404
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:09,079
I really wish I could help but...

405
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:13,440
A lot of the staff
never figured on any list.

406
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:15,559
That's what I heard.

407
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:23,519
Hello.

408
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,280
Me again.
Can I ask you something?

409
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,400
Did any staff stay on after the attack?

410
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,400
No.

411
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:33,559
You're sure?

412
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:37,800
Yes, as I said, they were all replaced.

413
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:42,079
Even the cooks and...
The servers...

414
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,599
Even the cooks all left.

415
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:47,039
Look, I wasn't there.
I don't know what happened.

416
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,960
Can you do the other room?
Please.

417
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:53,840
I've not done this one.

418
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:57,000
Finish it later. Thanks.

419
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,000
Hello!

420
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:17,679
- Recognize me from earlier?
- Yes.

421
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,719
You know Thomas?

422
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,360
Guy with crutches, here the other day.

423
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:24,440
- Vaguely.
- He said you worked here before.

424
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,559
I have a few questions...
About people you worked with.

425
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,880
I need your help finding someone.

426
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:38,840
Okay, but not long.
I live way out of town.

427
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,519
It's the person I was with
during the attack.

428
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,719
He was a cook.

429
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,920
He had an apron at least.
And a small tattoo here.

430
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,840
He wasn't on the list of dead.

431
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,440
Lots of the cooks were undocumented.

432
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,559
That's likely why they're not...
counted anywhere.

433
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,880
They melted away.

434
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:05,360
So they're not dead?

435
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,639
It explains the staff turnover.

436
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:12,960
I stayed on 'cause I'm French, so the
new manager agreed to keep me on.

437
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,679
The police also asked questions.

438
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:18,760
They found it weird,
staff members vanishing.

439
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,960
We said nothing.

440
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:24,400
Could you get me their names?

441
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,679
Okay, but not a word about me.

442
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:33,400
I could get in big trouble
and I need my job.

443
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,480
I promise.

444
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,599
- What's your name?
- Nour.

445
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,400
I tried to find someone, too.

446
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,039
We hid in the crawlspace,
with others, between air shafts.

447
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,880
I was so sure I was going to die
that we kissed.

448
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:01,199
He was Australian, first time in Paris.

449
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,039
You saw him again?

450
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:12,000
The evacuation separated us.

451
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,280
He was slightly wounded.

452
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:17,440
I looked all over facebook for him.

453
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,960
Couldn't find him.

454
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,760
We were just inside on the right.

455
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,639
Four of us, two dead.
Me and the Aussie left.

456
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:32,559
I saw the killer in the attack.

457
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:36,960
Face of an angel.

458
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,719
Somehow, he was...

459
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:41,920
Cheerful.

460
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,639
He looked so sweet.

461
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:48,599
It was as if
he was out buying cigarettes.

462
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:30,519
Excuse me, can we talk?

463
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,000
Look at me, please.

464
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,679
I wasn't in the bathroom.

465
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:40,679
I remember it clearly now.

466
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,559
I had been, sure, but before.

467
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:53,480
How would you know?

468
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,039
I remember now.

469
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:03,480
I held someone's hand.
A cook.

470
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,960
You got me mixed up with someone else.
It's no big deal but...

471
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:09,599
It's a mixup.

472
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,880
If you like to think so.

473
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:18,760
Hello.

474
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,960
Sorry to bother you so late but...

475
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:23,960
I saw you earlier.

476
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,039
Come in.

477
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,440
- I have nothing in. Water?
- Yes, please.

478
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,400
Here.

479
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,039
You found your guy?

480
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:46,400
I want to know if he's alive.

481
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,000
And that woman keeps accusing me
of locking myself in...

482
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:55,880
But I doubt it.
I feel there's something else.

483
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,960
She has no idea anyway.

484
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,679
If you sense he's alive.

485
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,880
They keep untraced victims' belongings
at police HQ.

486
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:07,559
- They do?
- Yes.

487
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,480
- You didn't notice on Facebook?
- No.

488
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,000
Go take a look.

489
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,920
Maybe you'll find something.

490
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,760
I went with my aunt.

491
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:22,199
It's all packed in plastic bags.

492
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:24,400
There's a funny smell.

493
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:29,159
There wasn't much.
A postcard they were writing me.

494
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:31,320
Want to see it?

495
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:35,679
Water Lilies.

496
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:42,400
They wanted me to come with them.

497
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,360
We fought about it all day.

498
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:51,519
Now I can't say goodbye to anyone
until we're good.

499
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,679
I just think anything might happen.

500
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,039
<i>When I heard about the attack,
I texted my dad.</i>

501
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,840
He said they were hiding.

502
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:21,400
Waiting for the police to free them.

503
00:52:23,639 --> 00:52:26,159
He also said he couldn't call me.

504
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,039
The noise might give them away.

505
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:33,679
So the waiting began.

506
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,119
<i>We were helpless,
with no idea what was going on.</i>

507
00:52:50,679 --> 00:52:53,039
<i>Eventually,
we switched off the TV.</i>

508
00:52:54,199 --> 00:52:55,719
And sat holding hands.

509
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,320
Put it out of your mind.

510
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:03,320
Get some sleep.

511
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,000
Sometimes
it's like I see them in the street.

512
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:16,039
I'd like to visit
the museum they went to.

513
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:18,719
See the last thing they saw.

514
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,719
Find that painting.

515
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:24,840
Like saying goodbye to them.

516
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:31,320
Hot here, isn't it?

517
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,039
You have any food in?

518
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:38,719
Sorry, I have nothing here.

519
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:42,880
I'll go down for something
from the deli. All right?

520
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:18,920
We'll make it.

521
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Breathe.

522
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:30,400
Keep breathing.

523
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,800
That's right.

524
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:51,000
Félicia?

525
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:07,159
This is yours?

526
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,840
Yes.

527
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,519
All we found in the bag. Please check.

528
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,360
- It's fine.
- Sign here then.

529
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,000
Thank you.

530
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:18,239
Sit down there.

531
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,800
Just here.

532
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:22,719
- The person with me...
- We're on it.

533
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:04,440
I got you a present.

534
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,360
Too kind.

535
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:26,719
- You seem delighted.
- Sure, it's great.

536
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,280
- Some culture. I'm touched.
- Nonsense.

537
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:35,960
- I called you but you didn't answer.
- I didn't have my phone.

538
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:39,679
- You're slow coming back.
- Sure.

539
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,719
I did as you said.
Went back to the restaurant.

540
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:46,440
And I remembered something.

541
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,360
What?

542
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:50,519
I held someone's hand.

543
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:56,800
Question is, is he alive?

544
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:05,639
I'm not sure that remembering
can help you.

545
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,880
Believe me... I'm not sure.
I doubt it's a good idea.

546
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,400
You okay?
They gave you painkillers?

547
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,880
I don't want anything.

548
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,039
I'll open the window maybe.

549
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:20,599
No, quit fluttering around.
It's all good.

550
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:22,519
Here...

551
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:24,519
Read to me instead.

552
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:28,119
I bet you're an excellent reader.

553
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,320
- Nobody read me stories.
- Me hardly ever.

554
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,760
If it's awkward, I can close my eyes.

555
00:59:38,119 --> 00:59:39,039
Go ahead.

556
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:41,519
- Really? Close my eyes?
- Yes.

557
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,519
Hello.

558
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,920
Estelle. Thomas's wife.

559
00:59:53,559 --> 00:59:57,119
We met due to the...
I'll be going.

560
00:59:57,199 --> 00:59:58,920
- Wait.
- No, don't go.

561
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,519
I just need him
to sign an insurance form.

562
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,239
Goodbye.

563
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:06,679
- You okay?
- Look, sign this.

564
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:12,599
Wait!

565
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,840
Sorry, I didn't mean,
I had no idea...

566
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:21,400
What you went through,
I can never share with him.

567
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,480
Thomas doesn't know but I do.

568
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,000
We'll never overcome this.

569
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:33,119
- I understand.
- Here.

570
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,360
He's not a reader.

571
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:47,440
<i>I read messages
posted on the Memoria forum.</i>

572
01:00:48,039 --> 01:00:51,760
<i>People like Félicia, trying to find out
how their loved ones died.</i>

573
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:54,199
<i>Or looking for people
they met that night.</i>

574
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:57,719
Looking for a guy who helped me.

575
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,760
<i>Wounded in both ankles,
in room one near the bar.</i>

576
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,440
I want to know if he survived.

577
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:06,440
I think about him every day.

578
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,280
<i>The person I'm looking for
leaned on me,</i>

579
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:12,119
and had two bullet wounds in the chest.

580
01:01:12,199 --> 01:01:15,119
<i>They were wearing a flecked,
purple or pink t-shirt.</i>

581
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:18,519
<i>I never dared reach out
for fear of awakening memories,</i>

582
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:22,119
<i>but if anyone knows
what happened to them, drop me a DM.</i>

583
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,400
I was evacuated right at the end.

584
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:30,440
Sadly, all the others left were dead.

585
01:01:31,159 --> 01:01:34,960
<i>I tried not to look.
The few I saw seemed to be sleeping.</i>

586
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,760
I hope that might console some of you.

587
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,920
<i>We hid in a spot
with a leak in the ceiling.</i>

588
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:49,280
<i>You asked my name.
I didn't ask yours.</i>

589
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:53,840
You had a tattoo and a kitchen apron.

590
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,920
<i>You clasped my hand.
We clung to each other.</i>

591
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,760
<i>When the police arrived,
I let go of your hand.</i>

592
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,440
Last I saw, you were wounded.

593
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,480
I hope you made it.

594
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:13,639
I hope you're alive.

595
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:16,679
That's all I want to know.

596
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,239
What are you doing here?

597
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:33,119
I call and you don't answer.
I'm worried.

598
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,679
Come on in.

599
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:45,280
I don't get what you're doing.

600
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,599
There's someone else?

601
01:02:52,199 --> 01:02:54,159
It's this support group thing?

602
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:58,719
You won't talk to me?

603
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,199
Vincent, what are you doing?

604
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,440
It's not funny anymore.
You're coming home now.

605
01:03:06,519 --> 01:03:09,480
- Enough is enough.
- Vincent, put it down, please.

606
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:10,760
Why not talk?

607
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:16,199
You refuse my help?

608
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,000
You can't help me.

609
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,280
I can't help you?

610
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:24,800
I can't do that life anymore.

611
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:26,719
Why?

612
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:35,119
I have to watch you go mad
and do nothing?

613
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,360
I wish I'd been in the fucking attack.

614
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:19,960
<i>Nour found the names of two cooks
working at the time at L'Étoile d'Or.</i>

615
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
<i>They'd dropped off the books,
appeared on no one's list.</i>

616
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:26,519
Excuse me,
I'm looking for these two people.

617
01:04:26,599 --> 01:04:29,679
<i>She remembered that,
in emergencies, the manager hired staff</i>

618
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,519
outside a phone store.

619
01:04:32,679 --> 01:04:35,679
<i>It was a hiring point
for undocumented workers.</i>

620
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,639
<i>Nobody knew the names
she'd given me.</i>

621
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,920
<i>But I heard of a middleman
in the restaurant trade.</i>

622
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,920
No, thanks.
I'm looking for Hakim.

623
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:03,039
Want to see me?

624
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,760
Get you anything?

625
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:08,320
No, thanks.

626
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:13,440
I was told you'd have info on a cook
who worked at L'Étoile d'Or, you know?

627
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,840
No, I don't know.

628
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:17,480
Who gave you my name?
I don't get it.

629
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,039
I'm just looking for someone
working there before the attack.

630
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:26,760
- Someone swung him the job.
- No.

631
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,800
Just a name or an address.

632
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:33,039
You don't know his name?

633
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:39,800
You don't know who you swung jobs for
at L'Étoile d'Or?

634
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,239
I don't swing any jobs.

635
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:44,320
I don't rent people an ID.
I work here.

636
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,599
I have two chefs and a commie.

637
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,719
I know their addresses, sure.

638
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,280
I'd like to help but you've lost me.

639
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:56,559
Somebody's been badmouthing me
and I want to know who.

640
01:06:58,519 --> 01:06:59,639
It's not about you.

641
01:07:00,519 --> 01:07:03,159
It's important I find the person.
He helped me.

642
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:04,519
That's all.

643
01:07:05,559 --> 01:07:06,920
Who sent you here?

644
01:07:08,599 --> 01:07:10,199
Forget it. Thank you.

645
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,800
Goodbye.

646
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:27,039
I know the guy you're looking for.

647
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,360
- Senegalese, with a tattoo...
- A little tattoo, yes.

648
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:33,159
He's not been around lately.
You know him?

649
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,280
Yes. Not his name but...

650
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,519
Driss Mbow.

651
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:42,480
On the ID he was loaned at least.
In real life, I doubt it.

652
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,880
He lives in a center near La Chapelle.
France Horizon.

653
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:51,000
I don't rent out IDs.
We help each other out.

654
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,039
Anyone home?

655
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:26,359
Sorry, I saw the door was open
and came in.

656
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,039
I'm looking for Driss Mbow.

657
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:32,840
Go play on the bed.

658
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:37,920
- You know him? You're related?
- No.

659
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:44,319
I was in the attack with him,
if he told you about it.

660
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,680
I just wanted to know
if he's well.

661
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,840
I don't know if Driss is his real name.

662
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,520
It's Assane.
Not Driss.

663
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,479
He's alive?

664
01:10:00,399 --> 01:10:03,880
I don't know.
He left for Italy. I don't know where.

665
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,920
Sorry, may I, just a second...

666
01:10:11,399 --> 01:10:12,600
I have water.

667
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:17,279
Here.

668
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:25,720
He left some things. Want to see?

669
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,800
- If he comes back, can you call me?
- Yes.

670
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,640
We're not family
but we made the trip together.

671
01:10:53,079 --> 01:10:54,479
I'll give you my number.

672
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:58,800
- And can I take a photo of him?
- Yes, of course.

673
01:11:49,359 --> 01:11:52,359
<i>I've been at L'Étoile d'Or
for six months.</i>

674
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,439
<i>People say that if the Senegalese,
Malians and Sri Lankans</i>

675
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,479
went on strike,

676
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,159
nobody would eat in Paris.

677
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:10,800
<i>Café owners
call us photocopiers.</i>

678
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,439
<i>Because we turn out
perfect copies of plates.</i>

679
01:12:38,039 --> 01:12:40,279
In life, I always get lucky.

680
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,159
I make it through the rain.

681
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,119
<i>The chef sent me down
to the basement.</i>

682
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:01,199
I heard the gunfire at the last second.

683
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:19,720
<i>She didn't notice right away
she was hurt.</i>

684
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,920
I promised her we wouldn't die.

685
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,159
Not here.

686
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:34,680
<i>I'd been through too much danger
to die in this closet.</i>

687
01:15:54,479 --> 01:15:56,319
I need to find this detail.

688
01:18:54,439 --> 01:18:56,800
Before, I never wondered
if I was happy.

689
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:01,439
Now I do.

690
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:04,279
- We were happy, so happy.
- Yes...

691
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:05,760
I don't get it.

692
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:09,960
Why associate it with me?

693
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,880
I have nothing to do with it.

694
01:19:16,439 --> 01:19:18,600
It's just
now I know I need to...

695
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,760
To make something of the whole thing.

696
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:24,479
Something new.

697
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,000
We should've had a kid.

698
01:19:38,319 --> 01:19:40,119
You wouldn't talk this way.

699
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,119
I would.

700
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:48,520
It wouldn't change a thing.

701
01:19:50,279 --> 01:19:52,880
It was a choice we made.
Honestly, I...

702
01:19:53,479 --> 01:19:54,600
I don't regret it.

703
01:20:06,039 --> 01:20:09,760
Tell me now. That night, you weren't
at the hospital. Were you?

704
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,119
Of course I was.

705
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,920
Yes, but not for an emergency.
You went to meet someone?

706
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,239
No, it wasn't an emergency.

707
01:21:16,119 --> 01:21:19,279
- Hi there, how are you?
- How are you doing?

708
01:21:20,039 --> 01:21:21,840
Good. This isn't a bad time?

709
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,159
Not at all. We invited some lawyers
to talk us through legal procedures.

710
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:27,600
So? You found him?

711
01:21:29,479 --> 01:21:32,560
No.
I ran out of leads.

712
01:21:33,359 --> 01:21:37,439
Sorry. I know how hard it is.
So it was too late.

713
01:21:38,119 --> 01:21:40,680
- Apparently.
- I wanted to tell you...

714
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:42,680
I'll see you later.

715
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:47,479
- Do you mind if we go to one side?
- Okay.

716
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,880
I know it wasn't you in the bathroom.

717
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,640
What makes you say that?

718
01:22:05,039 --> 01:22:06,239
I was wrong.

719
01:22:09,479 --> 01:22:10,520
I got confused.

720
01:22:11,319 --> 01:22:12,640
I know it wasn't you.

721
01:22:18,079 --> 01:22:19,760
My husband died there.

722
01:22:22,039 --> 01:22:23,199
I got things mixed up.

723
01:22:27,239 --> 01:22:29,720
- Someone was locked in the bathroom?
- Yes.

724
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:31,279
You know who it was?

725
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:35,880
It was me.

726
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:58,600
I'm sorry.

727
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:11,920
Well, see you.

728
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:16,119
Very soon.

729
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:30,479
- Sorry about last time.
- No...

730
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,520
No, it was me. I...

731
01:23:35,439 --> 01:23:37,039
I wanted to call you...

732
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,720
Same here, but I didn't dare.

733
01:23:45,079 --> 01:23:47,239
- You found him?
- No.

734
01:23:57,319 --> 01:23:58,399
Let's do it.

735
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:02,319
- Come on.
- We're ghosts. No one will see us.

736
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:07,119
Take a look?

737
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,039
How about it?

738
01:24:14,119 --> 01:24:15,960
It's lively, it's cool.

739
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:21,279
- Many people?
- Yes, but there's space.

740
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:25,039
Okay, let's go.

741
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:28,119
But I'll check the emergency exits.

742
01:24:28,199 --> 01:24:31,399
There must be some,
in case the bride changes her mind.

743
01:24:31,479 --> 01:24:33,720
We need an escape plan.
For disasters.

744
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:38,159
Yeah, the bride. Let's go.

745
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:06,319
Quite the atmosphere.

746
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:10,359
That's calling. It's calling to us.

747
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,239
Here goes.

748
01:25:17,319 --> 01:25:18,840
- Coming?
- No.

749
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:31,039
Come on.

750
01:25:35,439 --> 01:25:37,359
- You okay?
- A bit hot.

751
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:38,720
Gotta breathe.

752
01:25:58,159 --> 01:25:59,319
I think we...

753
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:03,039
We need to make up for that night.

754
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:05,920
How?

755
01:26:07,239 --> 01:26:08,840
I'd have waited for you.

756
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:11,039
Until you came back from the bathroom.

757
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:13,960
To talk to you.

758
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,079
I'd have stood up.

759
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:19,319
Brought you a drink.

760
01:26:22,479 --> 01:26:24,159
You'd have looked at me.

761
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,319
I'd have made you laugh.

762
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:33,079
- It would've worked?
- Sure.

763
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,720
- I'm a funny guy.
- Sure, I think it would've worked.

764
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,199
We need to outwit fate.

765
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:45,000
I think.

766
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,319
I have a scar.

767
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:43,600
So do I.

768
01:29:20,359 --> 01:29:21,359
I'm going.

769
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:27,520
Going where?

770
01:29:29,199 --> 01:29:30,840
I have one last thing to do.

771
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:36,439
- See you later.
- Yes.

772
01:29:37,359 --> 01:29:39,560
Essé!

773
01:29:40,399 --> 01:29:42,520
- Hello!
- Hey there!

774
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,800
Get your snacks, children.

775
01:29:45,239 --> 01:29:46,520
- You okay?
- Yes.

776
01:29:47,319 --> 01:29:49,560
I tried calling but the line was dead.

777
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:51,239
I changed my number.

778
01:29:53,159 --> 01:29:54,079
You know, I...

779
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:58,000
I wrote a letter for Assane and...

780
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,000
Do you have his address in Italy?

781
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:03,760
I heard that he's not in Italy.

782
01:30:04,279 --> 01:30:05,680
I think he came back.

783
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,239
Came back? Really?

784
01:30:13,119 --> 01:30:15,760
Works near the Eiffel Tower apparently.

785
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:41,079
- Do you know this person?
- No.

786
01:30:49,039 --> 01:30:52,600
Sir, I'm looking for this person.
Recognize him?

787
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:55,560
- No, don't know him.
- You don't know him either?

788
01:31:04,359 --> 01:31:07,159
Hello, can I get a coffee, please?

789
01:31:10,479 --> 01:31:11,880
- Here.
- Thanks.

790
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:00,000
This one. Five Euros.

791
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:03,279
Snowballs?
You want snowballs?

792
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:05,279
- Ten Euros.
- How much for those?

793
01:33:05,359 --> 01:33:07,800
Five. Five Euros.
It's good price.

794
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:11,199
You want the big one?
Ten Euros. Ten Euros?

795
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:15,439
No, I'll take it for five.

796
01:33:16,439 --> 01:33:17,439
Thank you.

797
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,479
- Where are you from?
- Wisconsin.

798
01:33:20,079 --> 01:33:21,319
Wisconsin?

799
01:33:22,079 --> 01:33:23,439
Thanks, man!

800
01:34:19,039 --> 01:34:21,199
We walked for a long time, drifting.

801
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:26,479
<i>He felt good
knowing I was alive somewhere.</i>

802
01:34:27,399 --> 01:34:29,000
I felt exactly the same.

803
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:32,520
We were alive.

804
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:34,479
I was alive.

805
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:53,359
Thank you for holding my hand.
