1
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,630
This is Zero One Alpha. We have secured the Falcon.

2
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,230
I say again,We have secured the Falcon.

3
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,100
I will count from one to ten.

4
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,220
Within that you'll tell me what I wanna know.

5
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,320
Otherwise the number ten is the last thing you'll hear.

6
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,020
One, two, three ...

7
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,270
four, five, six, seven, eight ...

8
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,610
Grenade. Get Back.

9
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,490
Shit.

10
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,590
Fucking missed it

11
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,690
How did I fucking miss it...

12
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,880
Merlin, I apologise for putting you in this position.

13
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,780
You trained him well.

14
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,370
James, your training is over.

15
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:46,170
- Welcome to Kingsman, Lancelot.   - Sir

16
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,560
I'll deal with this mess. Personally.

17
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,030
I very much regret that your

18
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,350
husband's bravery can't be publicly celebrated.

19
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,690
- I hope you understand that.   - How can I understand,

20
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,600
if you won't tell me anything?

21
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,480
I didn't even know he was away with his squad.

22
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,760
I'm afraid I can't say more.

23
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,840
I would like to present you with this medal of valor.

24
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,230
If you look closely on the back, there's a number.

25
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,210
And as a more concrete gesture of our gratitude,

26
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,830
we'd like to offer you a...

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,290
Let's call it a favor. The nature of it is your choice.

28
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,970
Just tell the operator:"Oxford's, not Brogue's".

29
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,220
And then I'll know it's you.

30
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,920
I do not want your help.

31
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,010
I want my husband back.

32
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,700
- What's your name, young man?   - Eggsy.

33
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,300
Hello, Eggsy. Can I see that?

34
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,290
You take care of this, Eggsy. Alright?

35
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,380
And take care of your mother too.

36
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,700
So sorry, Professor Arnold. Just a tiny bit more.

37
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,370
Oh for god's sakes, just take it off.

38
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,170
I am under very strict instructions not to hurt you.

39
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,520
Look, you've made a mistake.

40
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,430
I am university lecturer. I've got no money.

41
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,320
This isn't about money. Our boss just wants to just talk to you.

42
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,750
Am I meant to find that reassuring?

43
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,090
He'll be here soon. He'll explain.

44
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,110
Do you like whiskey? Red, get a '62 Dalmore.

45
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,030
Honestly, this whiskey is amazing.

46
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,280
You will shit.

47
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,330
I suppose asking to borrow a cup of sugar is a step too far.

48
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,660
Professor Arnold, I'm here to take you home.

49
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:34,470
1962 Dalmore . It would be a sin to spill any.

50
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,130
Don't you think?

51
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,480
Can you hold these, please?

52
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,460
Thank you.

53
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,010
Everything is clean.

54
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,040
My kind welcome.

55
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,700
No stomach for violence. I mean, literally.

56
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,020
I see one drop of blood, it's me done.

57
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,920
I am like ...projectile.

58
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,710
Listen, I'm so sorry you had to witness all this unpleasantness.

59
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:17,210
due to our uninvited guest. But I promise you:

60
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,500
By the time I find out who he works for ...

61
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,300
you and I will be the best of friends.

62
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,520
To the shop, please.

63
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,770
Arthur is in the dining room, sir.

64
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,850
- Arthur.   - Galahad.

65
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,990
The others were beginning to

66
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,910
wonder if we were going to have a double toast.

67
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,950
Gentlemen, I am thankful to say that it's been 17 years ...

68
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,440
since we last had occasion to use this decanter.

69
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,330
Lancelot was an outstanding agent and a true Kingsman.

70
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:34,230
He will be sorely missed. To Lancelot.

71
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,380
To Lancelot.

72
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,260
I intend to start the selection process

73
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,120
for Lancelot's replacement tomorrow.

74
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,800
I want each of you to propose

75
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,590
a candidate and have them report to UK HQ

76
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,610
No later than 9 p.M. GMT. Thank you.

77
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:01,280
Merlin. Come in.

78
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,960
Lancelot was investigating a group of

79
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,300
mercenaries who were experimenting with biological weaponry.

80
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,870
Glasses, gentlemen. Please.

81
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,190
Uganda, 2012. Synthetic Cathinone.

82
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,190
You put it in the water supply of a guerrilla army base.

83
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:22,280
Rage, cannibalism. Multiple fatalities.

84
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,080
Chechnya 2013. Insurgents turned on one another.

85
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,500
Indisputable, the work of our mercenaries

86
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,970
but no trace of any chemicals of any kind.

87
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,980
So what happened to Lancelot?

88
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,160
He tracked them to this property in Argentina.

89
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,220
And while he had them under surveillance,

90
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,560
he became aware that they had effected a kidnapping.

91
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,400
So he executed a solo rescue mission...which failed.

92
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,500
This is his last transmission:

93
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,480
- Who is he?   - Some climate change doomsayer.

94
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,930
Expounded something called Gaia

95
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,150
theory about the world healing itself or some such.

96
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,750
But what's curious, is he's not actually missing.

97
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,940
This is Professor Arnold.

98
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,040
At Imperial College, this morning.

99
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:09,340
It's all yours. And don't forget your membership proposal.

100
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,730
Try picking a more suitable candidate this time.

101
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,920
17 years and still evolving with

102
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,390
the times remains an entirely foreign concept to you.

103
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,490
You don't remind that I

104
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,650
wouldn't be here if it weren't for that young man.

105
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,740
He was as much Kingsman material as any of them. More so.

106
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,920
But he wasn't exactly one of us, was he?

107
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,610
Let's face it, Galahad. Your little experiment failed.

108
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,520
With respect, Arthur, you're a snob.

109
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,810
- With respect?   - The world is changing.

110
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,050
There's a reason why aristocrats developed weak chins.

111
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,080
Eggsy?

112
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,250
Eggsy, come here.

113
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,770
- Got any whistler paper?   - No.

114
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,460
Why don't you do your mamma a favor,

115
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,210
go down to the store and get some.

116
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,510
- Get 'em yourself.   - Oy,

117
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,350
What'd I say to you about speaking to Dean like that?

118
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,020
Feels like a crowd in here Why don't Dean's poodle go?

119
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,570
I'll say you what?

120
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,190
Why don't you take this and

121
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,180
get the stuff and get yourself some sweets?

122
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,650
And while you're gone,

123
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,630
we'll show your mother how three can be a good company.

124
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,540
Thanks babe.

125
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,530
Come here.

126
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,540
Here we go.

127
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,330
Is it better?

128
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,280
If Dean treats mum so bad, why doesn't she leave him?

129
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,360
Low self-esteem. That's her problem.

130
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,880
Fuck off, why would she have low self-esteem?

131
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,620
Note his mum's a wolfie.

132
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,340
- No offense pal.   - It's alright.

133
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,650
One of this days I'm gonna smash his face in.

134
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,090
Are you mental, cuz?

135
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,530
He'll just get that lot to do you

136
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,180
and then pretend he knew nothing...about it.

137
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,710
Oy, you think you can chat shit about us and

138
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,470
we'll do nothing just because our guy's bangin' Eggsy's mum?

139
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,850
- Pretty much, yeah.   - Leave it,

140
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,550
let's just go, man. It's not worth it.

141
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,660
You boys have overstayed your welcome. Leave.

142
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,210
What?

143
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,210
Sorry about that bro.

144
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,410
Yeah...muck.

145
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:56,030
They are not fucking worth it, cuz.

146
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,650
It's freezing. Why are we walking?

147
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,950
You jacked his fucking car keys, bruh?

148
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,320
Yeah, now we're gonna nick his car.

149
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,590
Shit.

150
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,920
Hold on boys.

151
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,190
That's my fucking car.

152
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,560
Hey! Hey! Eggsy.

153
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,000
I swear, you're in fucking trouble.

154
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,390
You are fucking dead!

155
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,880
Stop it!

156
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:30,990
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

157
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,030
Floor it, Eggsy.

158
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,740
Hey yeah Dean, look it's me.

159
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,840
Eggsy just stole my fucking car.

160
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,710
I've come out of the pub, he's done 15

161
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,320
about donuts on my fucking face and then he's drove off.

162
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:55,610
He's disrespecting me and so he's disrespecting you.

163
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,610
Oh hold up. What the...

164
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,150
Damn it.

165
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,540
Foxes are vermin, guys. You should've driven it over.

166
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,640
I should've done a lot of things.

167
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,740
I'll sort this, get out of the car.

168
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,830
Get out of the fucking car.

169
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,220
Eggsy, there is no such thing as honor among thieves.

170
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,600
Now you can start giving

171
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,020
me some names of the boys you were with...

172
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,210
Or you go down. It's up to you.

173
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,040
I want to exercise my right to a phone call.

174
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,600
Well, I hope it's to your mom...

175
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,830
to tell her that you're going to be 18 months late for dinner.

176
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,190
Customer complaints. How may I help you?

177
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:04,060
My name's Eggsy Unwin. Sorry, Gary Unwin.

178
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,560
And I'm up shit creek, I'm in an urban police station

179
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,280
and my mom said to call this number if ever I needed help...

180
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,850
I'm sorry, sir. Wrong number.

181
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,500
Wait, wait

182
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,420
Oxford's not Brogue's?

183
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,740
Your complaint has been duly noted,

184
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,640
and we hope that we've not lost you as a loyal customer.

185
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,730
What?

186
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,570
but...yep

187
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,720
Yes, I totally understand.

188
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,020
Eggsy.

189
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,590
- Would you like a lift home?   - Who are you?

190
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,890
- The man who got you released.   - That ain't an answer.

191
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,190
A little gratitude would be nice.

192
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,380
My name is Harry Hart. And I gave you that medal.

193
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,380
Your father saved my life.

194
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,570
So before you was a tailor, was you in the army? Like an officer?

195
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,760
Not quite.

196
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,270
So where was you posted, Iraq or something?

197
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,570
Sorry, Eggsy. Classified.

198
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,460
But my dad saved your life, yeah?

199
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,760
The day your father died, I missed something.

200
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,240
And if it weren't for his courage,

201
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,750
my mistake would have cost the lives of every man present.

202
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,800
So I owe him.

203
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,850
Your father was a brave man. A good man.

204
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,310
And having read your files, I'd think

205
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,440
he'd be bitterly disappointed in the choices you've made.

206
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,370
You can't talk to me like that.

207
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,160
Huge IQ, great performance in primary school.

208
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,070
And it all went tits up.

209
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,340
Drugs, petty crime, never had a job.

210
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,080
Do you think there's a lot of jobs going around?

211
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,400
Doesn't explain why you gave up your hobbies.

212
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,530
First prize, regional under tens' gymnastics

213
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,080
Two years in a row.

214
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,220
Your coach had had you pegged as Olympic team material.

215
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,200
Yeah and when you grow up around someone like my stepdad,

216
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,420
you pick up new hobbies pretty quick.

217
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,220
Always someone else's fault.

218
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,820
And who's to blame you for quitting the Marines?

219
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,510
You were halfway through training, doing brilliantly, but you gave up.

220
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,450
Because my mum went mental.

221
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,310
Banging on about losing me as well as dad.

222
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,370
Then we wouldn't be cannon fodder for snobs like you.

223
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,700
Judging people like me from your ivory towers,

224
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,820
with no thought about why we do what we do.

225
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,420
We ain't got much choice, you get me?

226
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,150
And if we was born with the same silver spoon up our arses...

227
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,570
we would do just as well as you, if not better.

228
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,830
What the fuck you doing here? You taking a piss?

229
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,810
Some more examples of young men

230
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,680
who simply need a silver suppository?

231
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,210
No, they are exceptions. Come on.

232
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,080
Nonsense, we haven't finished our drinks.

233
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,770
After you nicked his car, Dean says

234
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,370
you're a free guy I don't give a shit what your mum says.

235
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,170
Listen, boys.

236
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,600
I have had a rather emotional day, so

237
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,630
whatever your beef with Eggsy is and I'm sure its well founded...

238
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,730
I would appreciate it enormously

239
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,830
if you could just leave us in peace ...

240
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,460
until I finish this lovely pint of Guinness.

241
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,860
You should get out of the way,

242
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,260
Granddaddy. Or you'll get hurt a lot.

243
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,800
He ain't joking, you should go.

244
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,660
Excuse me.

245
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,330
If you're looking for another rent boy,

246
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,430
they're on the corner of Smith's Street.

247
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,140
Manners...

248
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,590
maketh...

249
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,800
the man.

250
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,420
Do you know what that means?

251
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,010
Then let me teach you a lesson.

252
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,320
Are we going to stand around here all day,

253
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,700
or are we going to fight?

254
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,030
You fucking dirty. You fucking dirty.

255
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,780
STUN

256
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,020
Amnesia

257
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,500
Sorry about that. Needed to let off a little steam.

258
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,340
Yesterday a friend of mine died.

259
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,390
He knew your father too, actually.

260
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,090
I do apologise, Eggsy.

261
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,080
I should not have done this in front of you.

262
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,030
No. Please. I won't say nothing,

263
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,390
I swear. If there is one thing I can do, it's keep my mouth shut.

264
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,060
You won't tell a soul?

265
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,480
As a fact, I've never crossed anyone out.

266
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,570
- Is that a promise?   - On my life.

267
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,070
Much appreciated, Eggsy.

268
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:31,860
You're right about the snobs. But there too, there are exceptions.

269
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,860
Best of luck with everything.

270
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:51,140
In celebrity news, The Richmond Valentine movie

271
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,540
premiered in Hollywood, last night.

272
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,060
The story of the Internet billionaire's rise to power

273
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,150
is expected to be this award season's hot ticket.

274
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:02,380
One notable absence from the red carpet is Iggy Azalea,

275
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,460
still missing three days after he....

276
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,030
after she failed to appear at her Oakland concert.

277
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,550
No ransom has been demanded.

278
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,870
Eggsy, just go, please. Because he's gonna...

279
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,800
- Please! Don't hurt him.   - Fuck off!   - Don't hurt him!

280
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,200
Get the fuck away! Shut the fuck up.

281
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,560
Who was with you in that fucking pub?

282
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,310
I want to know the name of the geezer you were with.

283
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,710
I was with no one.

284
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,320
- Who was it?   - I don't know what you're fucking on about.

285
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

286
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,220
Fucking tell me the name.

287
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,120
I don't know what you're fucking on about.

288
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,260
You listen to me. I want to know who you was

289
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,860
with in that pub. Do you understand?

290
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,960
I want to know his fucking name.

291
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,950
I swear I'll rip you out.

292
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,920
- Tell me!   - I don't know what you're fucking on about.

293
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,920
- Tell me!   - Just tell him, Eggsy!

294
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,480
Fuck off. Fuck off.

295
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,980
I can kill you right now and no one in the world will know this.

296
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,460
But I wouldn't.

297
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,930
I have enough evidence on your activities to have you locked up for the rest of your life.

298
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,030
- Mister Dean Anthony Baker.   - What the fuck?

299
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,020
So I suggest you leave the boy alone.

300
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,760
Or I shall be forced to deliver it to the appropriate authorities.

301
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:09,410
Eggsy, meet me at the tailor I told you about.

302
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,570
What the fuck's going on here?

303
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,020
Let's see how you fucking make it.

304
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,730
Here's Eggsy.

305
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,410
Come here.

306
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,820
You wanker! I'll have you soon.

307
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,910
I've never met a tailor before.

308
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,520
But I know you ain't one.

309
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,430
Come with me.

310
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,260
Come on in.

311
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,450
What do you see?

312
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:31,590
Someone who wants to know what the fuck is going on.

313
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,480
I see a young man with potential.

314
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,580
A young man who is loyal.

315
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:44,660
Who can do as he is asked, and who wants to do something good with his life.

316
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,970
Did you see the film "Trading Places"?

317
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,970
No.

318
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,460
How about "Nikita"? "Pretty Woman"?

319
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,460
Alright.

320
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,110
My point is,

321
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,160
the lack of a silver spoon has set you on a certain path,

322
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,550
but you needn't stay on it.

323
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,820
If you're prepare to adapt and learn, you can transform.

324
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:09,450
Oh, like in "My Fair Lady"?

325
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:15,040
You're full of surprises. Yes, like "My Fair Lady".

326
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,840
Only in this case, I am offering you the opportunity to become a Kingsman.

327
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,630
- A tailor?   - A Kingsman agent.

328
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,730
- Like a spy?   - Of sorts.

329
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:33,120
- Interested?   - You think I've got anything to lose?

330
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:43,740
Since 1849, Kingsman Tailors have clothed

331
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,310
the world's most powerful individuals.

332
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,050
In 1919, a great number of them

333
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,800
had lost their heirs to World War 1.

334
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,900
That meant a lot of money going uninherited.

335
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,500
And a lot of powerful men with a desire to preserve peace and protect life.

336
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,220
Our founders realized that

337
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,490
they could channel that wealth and influence for a greater good.

338
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:08,490
And so began our adventure.

339
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:14,510
An independent international intelligence agency operating at the highest level of discretion.

340
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,050
Without the politics and bureaucracy...

341
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,070
that undermine the integrity of government run spy organizations.

342
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,590
A suit is the modern gentleman's armor.

343
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,970
And the Kingsman agents are the new knights.

344
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,860
- How deep does this fucking thing go?   - Deep enough.

345
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,020
Shit. We're late.

346
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,390
Your father had the same look on his face.

347
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,240
As did I.

348
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,210
Come on.

349
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,080
Galahad. My code name.

350
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:59,180
- Late again, sir.   - Good Luck.

351
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,310
In you go.

352
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,880
Fall in.

353
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,050
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Merlin.

354
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:23,850
You are about to embark on what is probably the most dangerous job interview in the world.

355
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:28,950
One of you and only one of you will become the next Lancelot.

356
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:34,140
Can anybody tell me what this is? Yes

357
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,650
- A body bag, sir.   - Correct.

358
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,640
- Charlie, isn't it?   - Yes, sir.

359
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,030
Good. In a moment, you will each collect a body bag.

360
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,430
You will write your name on that bag.

361
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:47,830
You will write the details of your next of kin. On that bag.

362
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:51,420
This represents your acknowledgement of the risks that you are about to face...

363
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,800
as well as your agreement to strict confidentiality,

364
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,620
which incidentally if you break...

365
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,410
will result in you and your next of kin being in that bag.

366
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,610
Is that understood?

367
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:10,000
Excellent. Fall out.

368
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,390
Roxanne. But call me Roxy.

369
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,990
- I am Eggsy.   - Eggy?   - No. Eggsy.

370
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,330
Eggy...and where did they dig you up?

371
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,290
You know we are not allowed to discuss who proposed us.

372
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,230
Then we need to bite his head off.

373
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,080
Charlie's only making conversation, right Charlie?.

374
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,180
- I'm Digby.   - Digby

375
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,110
Eggy, this is Rufus. Rufus, Eggy.

376
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:45,270
- So Eggy, are you Oxford or Cambridge?   - Neither.

377
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,050
St. Andrews? Durham?

378
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,870
Oh wait, I think we may have met.

379
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,720
Did you serve me at the McDonalds in Winchester Service Station?

380
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,560
No.

381
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,070
It must be St. Andrews.

382
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,360
- Just ignore them.   - Do you need a pen?

383
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,220
- Cheers.   - Amelia, isn't it?

384
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,290
Amelia. Eggsy.

385
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,820
Hi, Eggsy.

386
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,410
- Don't take any notice of those guys.   - That's what I told him.

387
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,260
It's just scare tactics.

388
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,560
Classic army technique. No one's gonna die.

389
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,490
Shame.

390
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:26,760
Great, so you don't know, the CIA don't know.

391
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,540
Nobody knows who this guy is?

392
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,940
Fine. Seriously, it's fine.

393
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,540
Well, it's not really fine but it's not why I'm here.

394
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,390
Hell man, you know me. Money's not my issue.

395
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,500
I could have retired straight out of MIT,

396
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,190
fucked off to some island and let the business run itself.

397
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:48,520
Nobody told me to try and save the planet. I wanted to.

398
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:52,720
Climate change research, lobbying, years of studying, billions of dollars.

399
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,950
And you know why quit?

400
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:59,820
Because the last time I checked, the planet was still fucked.

401
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,580
Hence, my epiphany.

402
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,610
Money won't solve this.

403
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:09,900
Those idiots who call themselves politicians, they bury their heads in the sand ...

404
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,650
and stood for nothing but re-election.

405
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,490
So I spent the last two years trying to find a real solution.

406
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,000
And I found it.

407
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:24,380
Now, If you really want to make the world a better place...

408
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,800
I suggest you open your fucking ears

409
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,940
because I'm about to tell it to you.

410
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,900
Go on, Mr. Valentine. I'm still listening.

411
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:37,170
As long as you agree to all my terms.

412
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,020
Do not panic. Listen to me. Stay calm.

413
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,020
Fuck.

414
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,320
- U snorkels.   - U snorkels?

415
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:38,360
- Showerheads.   - Showerheads?

416
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,460
She's right. Go. Fucking go.

417
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,830
And what about pulling the fucking door?

418
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,820
Congratulations on completing your first task.

419
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,420
Charlie, Roxy, well done.

420
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,720
For those who 're still confused

421
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,300
If you get a breathing tube run the U-bend of a toilet,

422
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,010
you have an unlimited air supply.

423
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,510
Simple physics. Worth remembering.

424
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:25,910
Eggsy, well done for spotting that was a two-way mirror.

425
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,750
I've seen enough of 'em.

426
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,200
Yeah you can all wipe those smirks off your faces.

427
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,260
Because as far as I am concerned, every single one of you has failed.

428
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,690
You all forgot the most important thing:

429
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,790
Teamwork.

430
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,970
So much for classic army technique.

431
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:03,170
35, 105.

432
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,970
That's it. That's it.

433
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,720
Hello. Can I help you?

434
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,150
Yes, I have a question about anthropogenic force.

435
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:21,290
Really? Well, it's actually quite fascinating.

436
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,900
My colleague died trying to rescue you.

437
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,780
And I'm sure you saw how well-trained he was.

438
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,720
So I suggest you tell me who kidnapped you

439
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,740
and why they let you go.

440
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,860
I have no idea what you're talking about ...

441
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,240
I can not say, it was ...

442
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,730
Oh for god's sake, I barely touched you. How man are...

443
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,690
Fuck that guy, whoever he is, I'm gonna...

444
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:04,700
He made me kill Professor Arnold.

445
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,600
Goddamn loved Professor Arnold.

446
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,600
Well the good news is we know the emergency and surveillance systems work.

447
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,740
You know what is not good news?

448
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,140
"My colleague died." That's what he said.

449
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,370
This is an organization and they are all over us.

450
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,840
Whoever you spoke to...

451
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,980
I told you, I am in contact with the KGB, MI6,

452
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,590
Mossad and Beijing.

453
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:25,490
- They all insist he wasn't one of theirs.   - Beijing.

454
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,680
So freaky how there's no recognizable name for the Chinese Secret Service.

455
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,280
So freaky how there's no recognizable name for the Chinese Secret Service.

456
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,280
Now that's what you call a secret, right?

457
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,820
You know what?

458
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,270
Fuck it. We need to speed things up. Bring the product release forward.

459
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:42,970
They are only halfway into production. Speeding it will cost a fortune.

460
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,170
Do I look like I give a fuck? Just get it done..

461
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,820
As some of you would have learned last night:

462
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,860
Teamwork is paramount here at Kingsman.

463
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,350
We are here to enhance your skills, test you to limits.

464
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:03,350
Which is why you're gonna pick a puppy.

465
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,420
Wherever you go, your dog goes.

466
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,070
You will care for it, you will teach it.

467
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,240
And by the time they are fully trained, so will you be.

468
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,940
Those of you who are still here, that is.

469
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,930
Do you understand? Choose your puppy.

470
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:24,730
- A poodle?   - What? They are gun dogs.

471
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:28,020
Oldest working breed. Easy to train.

472
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,060
A pug?

473
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,110
This is still a bulldog, isn't it?

474
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,130
It would get bigger though, wouldn't it?

475
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:42,130
Shit.

476
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,500
His MRI shows no signs of concussion.

477
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,900
No direct brain trauma at all.

478
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,900
How much longer can he be out?

479
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,900
That's the million-dollar question.

480
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,370
We don't know what he was exposed to in there.

481
00:39:58,370 --> 00:39:59,490
What about Harry's footage?

482
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:02,200
It didn't stream to his home terminal?

483
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,210
Encrypted and uncrackable.

484
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,770
If and when he comes round,

485
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,680
you might wanna have a word with him about sharing his password.

486
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,180
Is he gonna be alright?

487
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:15,280
We need to have patience, Eggsy. But there is hope.

488
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:19,870
If I were you, I'd concentrate on your training. Make it through the test, make him proud.

489
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,460
Come on, J.B. Come on.

490
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,140
I am not gonna be last cause of you.

491
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,990
J.B, I'll shoot you, goddamn.I'll fucking shoot you.

492
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,350
Merlin said we're not allowed to hold you.

493
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,550
Bollocks.

494
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,880
Water.

495
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,550
Come on then.

496
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:34,620
Eggsy, you forget it.

497
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,970
Oh what's wrong mate, can't take a joke?

498
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,010
Seriously, you'll get turned out and it's just not worth it.

499
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,830
Maybe I don't give a fuck about getting kicked out.

500
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,220
Really? Come on, you player.

501
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,320
Charlie, fuck off.

502
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,930
Yeah, go on, walk away. Dickhead.

503
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,980
Come on, J.B. It's all right.

504
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:09,470
You have exactly one hour to complete the test. Starting now.

505
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,250
New target. 800 meters.

506
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,260
It's unbelievable. You're still here.

507
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,660
Lingering on like some big steaming shit that just won't flush.

508
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:22,930
Roger that. Target identified. And how about you shut the fuck up.

509
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,430
Positive discrimination. It isn't worth it.

510
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,600
Like those fucking steak cooks who go down seaways

511
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,550
because their mum's a one-legged lesbian.

512
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,520
You don't know fuck-all about my grades.

513
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,840
Oh forgive me. I'm sure you're highly educated.

514
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,540
Fire when ready.

515
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,430
How's that for positive discrimination?

516
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,320
I wanna thank you both for listening.

517
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:58,810
And I really, really appreciate your travelling all this way, Your Royal Highness.

518
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,080
And you too, Prime Minister.

519
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,610
I think this is quite brilliant.

520
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,800
It is absolutely brilliant.

521
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,100
You are completely crazy.

522
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,100
Prime Minister, please remain sober-minded.

523
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,590
How can you take it into consideration?

524
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:24,580
- No! Don't...   - I'm sorry, Your Royal Highness ...

525
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:26,520
but you got a big role to play...

526
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,880
in getting the Scandinavian region back on track.

527
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,980
You're popular, inspirational and you have the power to galvanize the people.

528
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,980
Now whether you're on board or not...

529
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:41,070
I am going to have to insist on getting you somewhere I can ensure your safety.

530
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:44,370
How about you, Prime Minister? You in or out?

531
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:48,460
Well, I think it's about time that a politician did something that...

532
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,760
- actually made a difference.   - Too true.

533
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,560
Take her away.

534
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:02,250
- Drink?   - Why not?

535
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,640
Security, help me.

536
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,440
Don't worry. No harm will come to the princess.

537
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:14,040
Well I'm Republican anyway, so it really doesn't matter.

538
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,430
Release the princess.

539
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,700
Okay, you're done. Not too bad, right?

540
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,890
- I hardly felt a thing.   - Welcome aboard.

541
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:59,520
The pleasure is all mine.

542
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:07,780
Ever heard of knocking?

543
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,980
Only when I'm casing a place to rob.

544
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,380
Merlin said you wanted to see me.

545
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,380
Hope J. B.'s training is going as well as yours is.

546
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,600
Sit.

547
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,870
Congratulations on making it to the final six candidates.

548
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:24,670
Your test results are even better than I could've hoped.

549
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,240
Come in.

550
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:36,170
Eggsy, I need to have a private conversation. You're dismissed.

551
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:40,710
Nonsens, let him observe. He'd learn a thing or two.

552
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:43,100
As you wish. Take a look at this.

553
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,790
"Oh for god's sake, I barely touched you. How man are..."

554
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:50,190
Fucking hell. That's ring, Harry.

555
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,040
You blew up his head? It's a bit much, isn't it?

556
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:57,830
Actually, the explosion was caused by an implant in his neck.

557
00:45:57,930 --> 00:45:59,750
Here. Under that scar.

558
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:02,230
Did my hardware pick up the signal that triggered it?

559
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:04,230
Fortunately, yes.

560
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:06,220
Unfortunately, the IP address is traced to it's registered to the Valentine Corporation.

561
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,720
Unfortunately, the IP address is traced to it's registered to the Valentine Corporation.

562
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:11,720
It's not much of a lead. They have millions of employees worldwide.

563
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:14,420
No, Richmond Valentine is a genius.

564
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:20,060
Did you not see his announcement today?

565
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:21,620
No.

566
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:31,400
We each spend on average $2,000 a year on cellphone and internet usage.

567
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,780
It gives me great pleasure to announce,

568
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:37,290
those days are over.

569
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:40,920
As of tomorrow, every man, woman and child can claim

570
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,590
a free SIM card...

571
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:46,980
compatible with any cellphone, any computer and ...

572
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:51,180
utilize my communications network for free.

573
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,780
Free calls. Free internet. For everyone.

574
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:58,200
Forever.

575
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:16,990
Valentine's assistant has the same implant scar.

576
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,450
I think Mr. Valentine and I shall have a tete-a-tete.

577
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:26,250
He's having a gala dinner next week.

578
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:29,140
I'll get you an invitation. You need to be careful though.

579
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,400
Since you were out, hundreds of VIPs have gone missing.

580
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,960
No ransom notes, exactly like Professor Arnold.

581
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,090
Then I suggest you make my alias somebody worth kidnapping.

582
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,520
- You're afraid of heights?   - Yes, it' OK, but I've done it before.

583
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,110
Probably alright if I don't think of it.

584
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:03,110
Hey, you'll be alright, You're top of the class.

585
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:07,970
Listen up, the mission is to land in the target

586
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:09,000
without the radar detecting you.

587
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,590
If I read you on the radar

588
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:13,110
or you miss the target, you go home.

589
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,800
Is that understood?

590
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:20,390
Drop zone coming up. 20 seconds.

591
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:22,990
Here we go.

592
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,610
Eggsy, I really don't think I can do this.

593
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:35,590
Of course you can't.

594
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:37,570
Get to the back and I'll show you how.

595
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,220
- Come on.   - Come on

596
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,550
Eggsy, wait. Hang on.

597
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:50,030
Roxy, just stop fucking about.

598
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,060
Follow me, yeah?

599
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,190
Come on.

600
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,840
Roxy, it's now or never.

601
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,090
Jump.

602
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,600
Good girl, Rox. I'm glad you made it.

603
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:52,280
Nice

604
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,290
My my, you're all very cheerful. You really think it was gonna be that straightforward?

605
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:01,790
Any idiot can read a heads-up display.

606
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:05,390
A Kingsman agent needs to be able to solve problems under pressure.

607
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:07,940
Like what to do when one of

608
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,180
your group has no parachute.

609
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:13,980
What? No parachute? Who?

610
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:17,590
- Fuck. Which one?   - What do we do?

611
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:18,950
I told you. Aim for the target

612
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,970
coming under the radar.

613
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:22,280
And I hope not to be

614
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,980
scraping one of you up.

615
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,550
But if I do have to and you're inside the target...

616
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,760
means I'll be very impressed.

617
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,360
Everybody listen, I've got a plan.

618
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:40,630
Pair up. Grab the closest person to you.

619
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,950
Rufus, come on.

620
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,940
Fuck.

621
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,230
Rufus.

622
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,940
Oh shit. I can't.

623
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:53,940
Fuck.

624
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,940
Thank god.

625
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:58,000
Rufus, you wanker.

626
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:02,360
We are an odd number now. Quick, make a circle.

627
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,920
Fuck. Fine boys. Let's do it.

628
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,560
We'll pull our cords one by one.

629
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:15,830
When we know who's it, the person on the rigth grabs him.

630
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,230
OK, Eggsy.

631
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:20,230
Good plan, Eggsy. You have 30 seconds.

632
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:21,210
Come on now. Hurry up.

633
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:23,210
Me first.

634
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:26,210
Fuck.

635
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:31,150
Me next.

636
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,600
I'll see you on the ground, boys.

637
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:39,970
Now me.

638
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:45,190
Fuck.

639
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,470
Roxy, no matter what happens now, I've got you. Alright?

640
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,840
OK, Eggsy.

641
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:58,340
- You first, okay?   - Yes

642
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:08,510
Eggsy Roxy

643
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:11,930
Oh, shit.

644
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:21,450
Oh, shit.

645
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:24,680
shit.

646
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:26,980
Hold on.

647
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:51,550
Hugo, Digby, you don't land in the K

648
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:53,220
then you're not in the K.

649
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:57,410
Rufus, you opened too soon. You were all over the radar.

650
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:59,510
All three of you, pack your bags. Go home.

651
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:05,610
Eggsy, Roxy, congratulations. You have set a new record.

652
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:08,210
Opening at 300 feet, that's pretty ballsy.

653
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,800
Well done on completing another task. Follow.

654
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:14,990
Sorry sir, but why the fuck you choose me as the gim?

655
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:17,120
Am I the expendable candidate?

656
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,500
No no no. You don't talk to me like that.

657
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:22,240
If you have a complaint, then you can whisper in my ear.

658
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,840
You need to take that jape off your shoulder.

659
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:05,050
Mr. DeVere. It's a pleasure to meet you.

660
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:07,770
I am sorry. I seem to have my dates muddles up.

661
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:10,840
Oh no no. I canceled the gala because of you.

662
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:14,240
Anybody willing to donate that much deserves a private dinner.

663
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,740
Come in.

664
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,010
Thank you.

665
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:22,400
Gotta admit, I was really intrigued to meet you.

666
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:24,670
There are not many billionaires I do not know.

667
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:25,430
I don't doubt it.

668
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:28,600
Obviously, I have had my people looking into your affairs

669
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:30,830
and that's some pretty old money you're from.

670
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,730
How'd your folks make it?

671
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:35,020
Property, mostly. Property in the markets.

672
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:37,910
Nothing personal, if that's your concern.

673
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:40,840
Ah look, I'm just in to find out what kind of person you are.

674
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:41,710
I'm sure you understand that.

675
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:43,810
- I most certainly do.   - Hope you're hungry.

676
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:46,900
- I'm famished.   - Good. Grab a seat.

677
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:11,080
- I'd have the Big Mac, please.   - Great choice.

678
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:14,580
But nothing beats two cheeseburgers with secret sauce.

679
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:17,970
- Tastes great with this '45 Lafite.   - A classic pairing.

680
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:19,740
May I suggest Twinkies

681
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,870
with 1937 Chateau d'Yquem for pudding?

682
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:23,620
I like it.

683
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:27,460
So you want to donate to my foundation?

684
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:31,060
You are aware that I wind things down in that area, right?

685
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:34,420
Climate changes affect us all, Mr. Valentine.

686
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,550
And you are one of the few powerful people who seems to share my concerns.

687
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:40,620
I stepped things down because I wasn't getting anywhere.

688
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,450
Every bit of reasearch kept pointing to the same thing.

689
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:45,740
The carbon emissions are a red herring,

690
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:48,740
and we are past the point of no return no matter what remedial actions we take.

691
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:50,570
You know your shit.

692
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:56,120
I sometimes envy the blissful ignorance of those less well-versed in their shit.

693
00:55:57,330 --> 00:55:59,330
As Professor Arnold always said:

694
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:02,430
"Humankind is the only virus cursed

695
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:05,430
to live with the horrifying knowledge of its host's fragile mortality."

696
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:09,010
There are not a lot of people who know about him.

697
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,420
Do you like spy movies, Mr. DeVere?

698
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:20,510
Nowadays, they're all a little serious for my taste.

699
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:23,810
But the old ones...marvellous.

700
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:27,100
Give me a farfetched theatrical plot any day.

701
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,100
The old Bond movies. Oh Man.

702
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,900
When I was a kid, that was my dream job.

703
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,400
A gentleman spy.

704
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:40,080
I always felt the old Bond films were only as good as the villian.

705
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,930
As a child, I rather fancied

706
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:44,360
a futuristic colorful megalomaniac.

707
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:49,440
What a shame we both had to grow up.

708
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:55,380
Bon appetit.

709
00:56:57,870 --> 00:57:00,970
Just give me a couple of days to think over your proposal.

710
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:04,470
I'll have my people get in touch with yours and it's all good.

711
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:08,060
Thank you for such a "happy meal".

712
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,960
- Well, you want me to follow him?   - No.

713
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,750
I put a nanotracker gel in the wine.

714
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:22,610
We'll know his every move for the next 24 hours.

715
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,450
Finally find out who he works for.

716
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,480
Valentine didn't let me out of his sight.

717
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,690
All I got was this, on the way in.

718
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,930
South Glade Mission Church is a hate group based in Kentucky.

719
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:41,030
The FBI have been monitoring them for years.

720
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:42,830
Do you think Valentine is a supporter?

721
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:44,780
No, I didn't see evidence yet of a direct connection,

722
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,280
but I'll keep looking.

723
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,820
Oh, by the way, the ever-growing list of missing persons...

724
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,950
Now includes Scandinavian Royalty.

725
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,820
Royal Crown Princess Tilde.

726
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:01,810
Just let me out, you PSYCHO!

727
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:04,910
I told you, you're free to go anytime you want.

728
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:09,200
- As long as you agree to my conditions.   - I don't agree.

729
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,290
And I am never ever going to agree!

730
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:13,800
I see it.

731
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,460
Bitch.

732
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:18,450
We want to see the British Council.

733
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:23,790
The list of missing celebrities and dignataries has continued to grow in recent weeks.

734
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:27,880
And world leaders are coming under increasing pressure to provide answers.

735
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:31,180
We are doing everything in our power to find princess Tilde.

736
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:36,180
You know, governments and security forces worldwide are working together...

737
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,940
to find the person behind these abductions.

738
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:42,440
In other news, people all over the world

739
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,470
continue to wait in line day and night to get their free SIM card.

740
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:48,260
Mrs. P. You get one?

741
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,960
Yeah, I've been queueing up all day.

742
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:55,460
This unprecedented giveaway by the philanthropist Richmond Valentine ...

743
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,550
has already seen over a billion cards distributed.

744
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:00,150
At ease.

745
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,290
So you thought you were done for the day, huh?

746
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:06,450
Probably not.

747
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:10,440
- A party?   - Tonight. In London.

748
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,240
- Who is this?   - Your target.

749
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:17,210
Your mission is to use your NLP Training

750
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:18,630
to win over the individual in the photograph in your envelope .

751
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:22,230
And when I say "win over", I do mean in the Biblical sense.

752
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:23,560
Easy

753
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:28,160
- Most girls love a bit rough.   - We'll see about that, yeah.

754
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,220
We certainly will.

755
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,480
Hi. Sorry, I just had to come over

756
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,110
and say "Amazing eyes".

757
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:42,710
- You wearing color contacts?   - No.

758
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:46,210
- You so are   - Oh my god. 'Nagging'. That's hilarious.

759
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:48,600
I haven't had anyone try that since the 90s.

760
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,500
Excuse me?

761
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:52,960
"Negging". Saying something negative

762
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,900
to a pretty girl in order to undermine her social value.

763
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,000
Its supposed to make you want to win his approval.

764
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,690
Absurdly basic neurolinguistic programming technique.

765
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:02,900
Is it just me or does this champagne taste a l'il bit funny?

766
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,190
That's an acquired taste, mate.

767
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:05,680
I think it's just cheap.

768
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,880
Get one of these instead. They're delicious.

769
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,790
You know, if you're interested in ornamental techniques,

770
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:10,080
this guy is textbook.

771
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,560
See what he just did? Its called an 'opinion opener.

772
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,080
He got you talking with a neutral question ...

773
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:16,380
got all of us involved in the conversation,

774
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,370
so that you crave individual attention.

775
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:20,850
Nah, I'm just saying that the champagne tastes weird...

776
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,570
Lady Sophie, Montague Herring,

777
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:23,670
phone call for you at reception.

778
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:26,190
- Be right back.   - See you in a bit, yeah.

779
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,110
See you in a bit.

780
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,930
Good job, Rox. I'm feeling a bit rough.

781
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:30,690
You alright?

782
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:32,090
Sorry to eavesdrop ...

783
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:35,650
but there is a much easier way to guarantee getting someone home.

784
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:37,550
Rohypnol.

785
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:41,650
Or even something stronger.

786
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:00,720
Who the fuck are you?

787
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:03,330
Where am I?

788
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:08,540
This knife can save your life.

789
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:13,540
Fuck

790
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:15,730
My employer's two questions for you, Eggsy.

791
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:21,160
What the fuck is Kingsman? And who is Harry Hart?

792
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,900
I do not know what the fuck that is.

793
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:25,310
Oh Eggsy, I just killed two of your friends

794
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:27,730
because they gave me the same bullshit answer.

795
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,450
Just cut the fucking ropes, please.

796
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,890
Hey, Eggsy, is the Kingsman worth dying for?

797
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:39,460
Fuck you.

798
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:55,680
Congratulations. Bloody well done.

799
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:01,360
- How'd the others do?   - Roxy passed with flying colors.

800
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:04,570
Charlie's up next. Want to watch?

801
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:07,160
Yeah, alright.

802
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,660
Is Kingsman really worth dying for?

803
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,120
No, it fucking isn't, shit! I'll tell all you want, please.

804
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,770
Chester King's Arthur,

805
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:17,620
head of a spy agency,

806
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:19,550
it's called Kingsman. Get me out of here.

807
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:22,650
Thank you Charlie. Much appreciated.

808
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:25,310
No, how was the fucking deal

809
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:26,310
No

810
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:38,530
I had such high hopes for you. You are a bloody disgrace.

811
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:41,930
I'm so sorry. Please untie me.

812
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:43,730
Untie yourself.

813
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:47,920
Arthur,Arthur, please.

814
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,780
You know who my dad is? Shit!

815
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:53,640
Anyone? Hello!

816
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,580
Galahad, Percival. Congratulations.

817
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:58,050
You candidates have reached

818
01:02:58,050 --> 01:02:59,710
the final stage of the testing process.

819
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:03,600
As tradition allows, you now have 24 hours to spend with them.

820
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:07,200
Eggsy, you should know your father reached this point.

821
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:11,300
From now on, there are no safety nets. Understood?

822
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,300
Good. Dismissed.

823
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:22,490
Charlie, time to go home.

824
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:23,220
Fuck you.

825
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,060
My fucking dad's gonna hear about this.

826
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:30,580
"To pee or not to pee?"

827
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,350
That was the headline the

828
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:35,230
day after I diffused a dirty bomb in Paris.

829
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:37,460
"Germany 1-England 5."

830
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:38,580
I missed that game.

831
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:41,730
I was breaking up an undercover spying at Pentagon.

832
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,710
My first mission. I foiled

833
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:51,480
the assassination of Margaret Thatcher.

834
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,560
Not everybody had thanked you for that one.

835
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:56,770
The point is, Eggsy, nobody thanked me for any of them.

836
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:00,600
Front page news, and all these occasions were celebrity nonsense.

837
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:02,240
Because it is the nature of

838
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,560
Kingsman that our acheivements remain secret.

839
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,000
A gentleman's name should

840
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,040
appear in the newspaper only three times:

841
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:10,640
When he's born, when he marries and when he dies.

842
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:14,140
And we are, first and foremost, gentlemen.

843
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,450
Pretty fucked then.

844
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:19,080
It's like Charlie said, I am just a pleb.

845
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:20,650
Nonsense. Being a gentleman has nothing

846
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:22,890
to do with the circumstances of one's birth.

847
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:25,330
Being a gentleman is something one learns.

848
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:27,770
Yeah, but how?

849
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:29,710
Alright, first lesson,

850
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:32,530
you should have asked me before you took a seat.

851
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:37,580
Second lesson, how to make a proper martini.

852
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,000
Yes, Harry.

853
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,130
Goddamn it. It fucking hurts.

854
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:48,040
You are the one who asked for a biometric

855
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,200
security system. What's wrong with a simple switch?

856
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:55,200
A simple switch? This is an extremely dangerous machine.

857
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:59,790
It should only be operated by someone responsible and sane as me.

858
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:02,980
Bad shit can happen if it falls into the wrong hands.

859
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:07,810
Are we done here? Shit

860
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:11,080
No, now this one, for the test of the church.

861
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:15,180
This one just has a short range. A simple switch will do.

862
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:23,750
So you gonna teach me how to talk proper like in 'My Fair Lady'?

863
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:25,310
That'd be absurd. Being a

864
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:27,960
gentleman has nothing to do with one's accent.

865
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,660
It's about being at ease in one's own skin.

866
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,240
As Hemingway said:"There is

867
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:35,090
nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man."

868
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:39,240
"True nobility is being superior to your former self. "

869
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,200
Now, the first thing every gentleman needs is a good suit.

870
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,690
By which I mean a bespoke suit. Never off the peg.

871
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:51,200
And Kingsman suits are always bulletproof,

872
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,690
So let's get you measured.

873
01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:55,220
And whether you get the job or not, you will

874
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:58,480
have a lasting and useful memento of your time at Kingsman.

875
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:02,480
I'm so sorry, sir, but a gentleman is completing his fitting.

876
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:06,970
- Fitting Room 2 is available.   - One does not use Fitting Room 2...

877
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:09,620
when one is popping one's cherry.

878
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:13,570
Perhaps I'll show you Fitting Room 3, while we wait.

879
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:26,360
- So we going up or down?   - Neither.

880
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,030
Is this it?

881
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:31,950
Of course not. Pull the hook on your left.

882
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,500
Oh yes Very very nice.

883
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:48,590
You're going to need a pair of shoes to go with your suit.

884
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:52,790
An Oxford is any formal shoe, with open lacing.

885
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:56,090
This additional decorative piece is called broguing.

886
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:59,110
- "Oxford's, not brogue's."   - Words to live by,

887
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:00,680
Eggsy. Words to live by.

888
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:02,380
Try a pair.

889
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:04,730
Your weapon scores are excellent, by the way.

890
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,010
These you're familiar with.

891
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,070
And this is our standard issue pistol.

892
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:11,250
It's quite unique. As you all see it, it also

893
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:14,370
fires a shotgun cartridge for use in messy close-range situations.

894
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:16,520
- How do they feel?   - Yeah good

895
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,460
Now do your very best in personation of a German aristocrat's formal greeting.

896
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:24,060
No, Eggsy.

897
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:29,350
That is sick.

898
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:32,260
In the old days, they had a phone in the heel as well.

899
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:33,560
How do I get it back in?

900
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:35,420
It is coated with one of the

901
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:39,140
fastest-acting neurotoxins known to man, so very carefully.

902
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,940
Now, I had a lot of fun with this.

903
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,730
One of our finest examples of chemical engineering.

904
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:50,440
Poison. Harmless when ingested.

905
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,830
But at a time, convenient to you...

906
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:55,930
it can be remotely activated.

907
01:07:56,130 --> 01:07:57,220
Primed.

908
01:07:58,300 --> 01:07:59,420
Lethal.

909
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:04,130
And what about these? What do these do? Electrocute you?

910
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:06,860
- Don't be ridiculous. It's a hand grenade.   - Shut up...

911
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,510
If you want to electrocute someone, you'll need a signet ring.

912
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:12,240
A gentleman traditionally wears the signet on his left hand,

913
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,010
but a Kingsman wears it on whatever hand happens to be dominant.

914
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:16,980
If you touch the contact behind the ring,

915
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:18,100
it delivers 50,000 volts.

916
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,300
And what about them? What makes them so special?

917
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,600
Nothing. That technology is caught up with the spy world.

918
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:29,080
Put it back, Eggsy.

919
01:08:32,190 --> 01:08:34,690
Perfect timing. Gentleman's just finished.

920
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:41,080
Mr. DeVere.

921
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:47,870
What a coincidence. You're totally the reason I'm here.

922
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:49,700
When you left my house, I was

923
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:52,940
searching for that dope-ass smoking jacket you had on.

924
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,620
And since I'm going to Royal Ascot,

925
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:56,860
apparently I need one of these penguin suits ...

926
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:00,060
Here I am. What are you doing here?

927
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,760
What's up man? Richmond Valentine.

928
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:06,240
This is my new valet. I was just introducing him to my tailor.

929
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:09,150
Another coincidence. So am I.

930
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:10,770
Did you have any chance to

931
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:12,850
- think further on my proposal?   - Most definitely.

932
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,740
My people will be getting

933
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:17,540
in touch with you very soon. I guarantee it.

934
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:22,600
A word of advice: Ascot requires top hat.

935
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:28,330
I might suggest Lock & Co. Hatters, St. James.

936
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:32,550
- "Lox", as in smoked fish?   - As in "Locked up".

937
01:09:35,530 --> 01:09:38,650
I have trouble understanding you people sometimes.

938
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,520
You all talk so funny.

939
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:51,240
Gentlemen, would you look after him please?

940
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:07,090
Now this is a dope-ass top hat.

941
01:10:09,090 --> 01:10:12,290
Gazelle, let's go Ascotting.

942
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:15,620
Your hat is fine Bill, come on.

943
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:17,780
Don't make me late for the queen.

944
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:21,280
Come on, Gazelle. We're gonna be late.

945
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,680
How far is Ascot? How far?

946
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:31,870
- Merlin said you wanted to see me, sir?   - Sit down.

947
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,360
Pretty dog. What's his name?

948
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:43,180
- J.B.   - As in "James Bond"?

949
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:43,700
No.

950
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:45,970
"Jason Bourne"?

951
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:46,500
No.

952
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,150
Jack Bauer.

953
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:50,850
Oh! Bravo.

954
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:53,520
It pains me to admit it, Eggsy, but I

955
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,950
think that one day you might be as good a spy as any of them.

956
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,000
Take it.

957
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:14,030
Shoot the dog.

958
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:22,520
This weapon is live.

959
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:26,620
Shoot the dog.

960
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,380
Give me the gun.

961
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:19,360
At least the girl's got balls,

962
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:26,260
Get out. I knew you couldn't make it.

963
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:31,350
Go home.

964
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:35,550
Merlin, send in Roxy, please.

965
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:04,320
Welcome to Kingsman, Lancelot.

966
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:30,290
- Mom.   - Eggsy.

967
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:33,790
Oh god, Where have you been? I've been so worried about you.

968
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:39,120
Oh my Dais, look how big you've got.

969
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:46,660
- Where is he?   - I am fine.

970
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:48,800
Eggsy, please please, just don't get involved...

971
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:52,050
No, I should never have left you on your own.

972
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:54,570
This stops right now. Be right back.

973
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:00,120
Hey Dean

974
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:02,850
Oh Mugsy, so you're back?

975
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:04,900
- You nicked a fucking taxi now?   - Yep

976
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,610
Yeah. Can I have a word about my mom's black eye?

977
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:11,140
You wanna have a word with me, you get out of that cab,

978
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:13,070
I'll knock you straight back down on your fucking arse.

979
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:18,580
Tell your muppets to go inside, then I'll get out.

980
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,480
Go on lads. There'll be two hits:

981
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:24,100
Me and him and then he and the floor.

982
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:26,300
Come on in, you prick.

983
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:29,030
Let's see what you got, eh. You wanna beat me?

984
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:29,910
What are you doing?

985
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,500
Oh no no no come on

986
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:33,380
Get out of the fucking car. What are you doing?

987
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:35,020
Now you've gone all bollocks.

988
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,840
Come on, he'll beat my fucking mother.

989
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:40,350
Come back when you've grown a pair. Mugsy.

990
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:08,140
You throw away your biggest opportunity over a fucking dog.

991
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:11,590
And then you humiliate me by stealing my boss's car.

992
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:15,910
- You shot a dog just to get a fucking job?   - Yes, I did.

993
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:22,120
Mr Pickle here reminds me of that every time I take a shit.

994
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:26,280
You shot your dog and now it's stuffed?

995
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:28,170
You fucking freak.

996
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:30,970
No. I shot my dog and then I brought him home and continued

997
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:34,270
to care for him for the next eleven years until he died of pancreatitis.

998
01:15:35,370 --> 01:15:37,850
It was a blank, Eggsy.

999
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:40,420
It was a fucking blank.

1000
01:15:40,730 --> 01:15:42,630
Remember Amelia?

1001
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:44,870
She didn't drown. She works

1002
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:47,550
in our tech department in Berlin. She's fine.

1003
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:49,200
Limits must be tested. A Kingsman

1004
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,650
only condones the risking of a life to save another.

1005
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:54,850
As my father saved your life even though your fuck-up cost his?

1006
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:57,270
What you've get him stuffed here also?

1007
01:15:58,640 --> 01:15:59,860
Can't you see that everything

1008
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:01,840
I have done has been about trying to repay him?

1009
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:08,590
Harry, listen to this.

1010
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:11,020
Valentine's alarm is saying something of note.

1011
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:13,760
You know what I love about pen and paper?

1012
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:16,630
Nobody can hack into this shit.

1013
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:20,320
Our worldwide tour was a complete success.

1014
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:23,100
We have total coverall.

1015
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:26,370
Like when all your numbers in bingo are crossed out.

1016
01:16:26,370 --> 01:16:26,940
Bingo!

1017
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:31,280
Bingo, the game. You have played Bingo, right?

1018
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:33,410
Do I look like I play bingo?

1019
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,560
Point is...

1020
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:39,950
if our tests go well at church tomorrow,

1021
01:16:39,950 --> 01:16:41,300
we are good to go.

1022
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,260
South Glade Mission Church.

1023
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,290
- Merlin, get the plane ready.   - Will do

1024
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:50,090
- I am so sorry. I'm gonna do every..   - You should be.

1025
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:52,990
You stay right there. I'll sort this mess out when I get back.

1026
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:02,180
And I say to you: Bear witness.

1027
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:05,560
Watch the news. Watch the news.

1028
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:10,420
AIDS, floods. The blood of the innocents spilled.

1029
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:15,520
And yet there are those who doubt this is the wrath of God.

1030
01:17:17,610 --> 01:17:21,110
Our filthy government condones sodomy.

1031
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:23,910
Divorce, abortion.

1032
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:30,700
And yet some still doubt, there is the work of the Antichrist.

1033
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:35,260
You do not have to be a Jew,a nigger, a whore ...

1034
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,950
or an atheistic science loving evolution spouter.

1035
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,500
Charming ceremony. Do you see Valentine anywhere?

1036
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,560
So my friends, although He is a just god,

1037
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:47,390
he is justly no turning back from the...

1038
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:50,380
AMERICA IS DOOMED

1039
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:53,570
Are you sure we are out of range?

1040
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:55,430
We're over a 1000 feet away. What's wrong?

1041
01:17:55,530 --> 01:17:57,020
What if the calculations are wrong?

1042
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:58,520
You just have to trust me.

1043
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:02,270
Jews, nigger, fag lovers.

1044
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:05,920
And the devil is burning them for all eternity.

1045
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:07,210
Excuse me.

1046
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:11,710
Where are you going? Hey, what's your problem?

1047
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:14,730
I am a Catholic whore,

1048
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:18,670
currently enjoying congress out of wedlock with my black Jewish boyfriend...

1049
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:21,210
who works in a military abortion clinic.

1050
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:25,020
So hail Satan. And have a lovely afternoon, madam.

1051
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:31,780
Oh shit, he's leaving. I'm starting the test now.

1052
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:34,590
Hope enough of these freaks have our SIM cards.

1053
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:41,080
I ask you to sit down.

1054
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:44,320
Leave this church like the infidel you are.

1055
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:48,430
It seems like the devil will really save you now.

1056
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:53,170
You will eat your babies. You will drown in the blood of the Lord.

1057
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:55,460
He will not save you.

1058
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:02,730
Oh,fuck.

1059
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:06,330
I can't watch this. Get over here.

1060
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,780
Jesus. Oh, fuck.

1061
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:53,110
Galahad, can you hear me? Harry!

1062
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:56,800
Harry, what the heck is going on?

1063
01:19:58,600 --> 01:19:59,800
Just turn the volume down please.

1064
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:04,700
- I didn't expect it to be that effective.   - What kind of response are we talking of?

1065
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,400
100%.

1066
01:20:07,390 --> 01:20:10,590
So everyone's been infected whether they have SIM card or not?

1067
01:20:10,790 --> 01:20:13,290
And it's added benefit of wiping out the Kingsman.

1068
01:20:13,690 --> 01:20:15,340
Not yet.

1069
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:11,930
Oh you need to see this.

1070
01:23:08,810 --> 01:23:12,780
What did you do to me? I had no control.

1071
01:23:14,010 --> 01:23:16,210
I killed all those people.

1072
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,900
- I wanted to.   - Clever, isn't it?

1073
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,330
In simple terms, it`s a neurological wave that triggers the centers of aggression

1074
01:23:24,330 --> 01:23:26,380
and switches off inhibitus.

1075
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:29,070
Transmitted through your nasty free SIM cards,

1076
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:29,990
I assume?

1077
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:34,910
You know what this look like?

1078
01:23:35,090 --> 01:23:38,480
Its like those old movies we both love.

1079
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:40,780
Now I'm gonna tell you my whole plan ...

1080
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:44,780
and then I'm gonna come up with some absurd, convoluted way to kill you...

1081
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,970
and then you'll find an equally comnvoluted way to escape.

1082
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:50,270
That sounds good to me.

1083
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:53,070
Well, this ain't that kind of movie.

1084
01:23:57,060 --> 01:23:59,060
No.

1085
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:09,210
Is he dead?

1086
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:11,750
That's usually what happens when you shoot someone in the head.

1087
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:13,280
It feels good, huh?

1088
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:16,310
No no, it does not feel good. It felt fucking awful.

1089
01:24:16,650 --> 01:24:18,760
What? You just killed how many people in that church.

1090
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,040
This is one guy.

1091
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:22,340
No, they killed each other.

1092
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:29,130
Okay, set down the countdown clock. This party starts tomorrow.

1093
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,250
Arthur?

1094
01:25:07,290 --> 01:25:10,990
- Are you there?   - Sadly, I am.

1095
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:14,580
Assemble the Kingsman.

1096
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:23,100
Can't you see that everything I have done has been about trying to repay him?

1097
01:25:43,450 --> 01:25:46,050
I see a young man with potential,

1098
01:25:46,050 --> 01:25:48,650
who wants to do something good with his life.

1099
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:08,330
Arthur, Harry is dead.

1100
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:10,880
Galahad is dead.

1101
01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:14,430
Hence, we have just drunk a toast to him.

1102
01:26:14,530 --> 01:26:17,130
Well then you know what that psycho's doing.

1103
01:26:17,230 --> 01:26:19,820
How many people in the world have got those SIM cards?

1104
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,620
Valentine can send a signal to any of them; all of them.

1105
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:24,520
If they all go home at the same time, then..

1106
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:27,960
Indeed. And thanks to Galahad's recordings,

1107
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:29,630
we have Valentine's confession.

1108
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:33,410
The intelligence has been passed on to the relevant authorities.

1109
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:35,680
Our work is complete.

1110
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:39,600
And a most distinguished legacy for our fallen friend it is too.

1111
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,600
And that's it?

1112
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,300
Come sit down, boy.

1113
01:26:47,190 --> 01:26:52,390
This is an 1815 Napoleonic brandy.

1114
01:26:53,290 --> 01:26:57,180
And we only drink it when we lose a Kingsman.

1115
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:00,050
Galahad was very fond of you.

1116
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:06,280
And on this occasion, I think it is acceptable for us...

1117
01:27:07,270 --> 01:27:08,970
to bend the rules a little.

1118
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:12,140
These are all Kingsmen?

1119
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:13,970
Yes, our founder members.

1120
01:27:15,670 --> 01:27:18,160
I want you to join me in a toast.

1121
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:21,260
To Galahad.

1122
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:26,260
To Galahad.

1123
01:27:29,050 --> 01:27:31,480
Harry said you don't like to break the rules, often.

1124
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:33,160
Why now?

1125
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:35,260
You're very good, Eggsy.

1126
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:39,130
Perhaps I'll make you my proposal for Galahad's position.

1127
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:44,340
Provided we can see eye to eye on certain political matters.

1128
01:27:47,230 --> 01:27:51,260
Can you guess what this is?

1129
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:54,970
I don't have to. Harry showed it.You click it, I die.

1130
01:27:55,130 --> 01:27:57,320
I thought that brandy tasted a bit shit.

1131
01:27:58,710 --> 01:27:59,820
Bravo.

1132
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:03,320
Valentine won you over. Somehow

1133
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:06,510
Once he explained, I understood.

1134
01:28:06,610 --> 01:28:09,110
When you get a virus, you get a fever.

1135
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:13,200
That's the human body raising its core temperature to kill the virus.

1136
01:28:13,610 --> 01:28:18,100
Planet Earth works the same way : Global warming is the fever...

1137
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:23,400
Mankind is the virus. We are making our planet sick.

1138
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:26,180
A cull is our only hope.

1139
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:30,990
If we do not reduce our population ourselves, there's only two ways it can go :

1140
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:35,590
The host kills the virus, or the virus kills the host.

1141
01:28:36,090 --> 01:28:38,970
- Either way...   - The result is the same:

1142
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:41,780
The virus dies.

1143
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:45,920
So Valentine's gonna take care of the population problem himself.

1144
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:48,770
If we don't do something, Nature will.

1145
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:52,870
Sometimes a culling is the only way to ensure that this species survives.

1146
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:56,410
And history will see Valentine as the man

1147
01:28:56,410 --> 01:28:58,760
who saved humanity from extinction.

1148
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:01,860
And he gets to pick and choose who gets culled, does he?

1149
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:04,030
All his rich mates, they get to live.

1150
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,260
And anyone he thinks is worth saving, he's keeping them safe.

1151
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:11,050
- Whether they agree with him or not.   - And you, Eggsy.

1152
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:17,800
In Harry's honor, I am inviting you to be part of a new world.

1153
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:22,940
It's time to make your decision.

1154
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:33,130
I would rather be with Harry. Thanks.

1155
01:29:33,530 --> 01:29:34,730
So be it.

1156
01:29:51,310 --> 01:29:56,410
The problem with us common types is, that we are light fingered.

1157
01:29:57,400 --> 01:30:00,600
Kingsman's taught me a lot. But slight of hand...

1158
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:02,800
Yes, they're our founder members.

1159
01:30:05,410 --> 01:30:07,290
...I had that done already.

1160
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:14,330
You dirty little fucking prick.

1161
01:30:48,950 --> 01:30:53,630
It's okay, Lancelot. Put it down. It's verified.

1162
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:57,600
Arthur's phone's just received an update text

1163
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:58,470
about getting to safety.

1164
01:30:58,470 --> 01:30:59,540
We don't have a lot time.

1165
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:02,400
- What you gonna do?   - The question is what we gonna do.

1166
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:05,240
God knows who's in Valentine's pocket and who's not.

1167
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:07,650
We've no choice.

1168
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:10,830
We are gonna have to deal with this ourselves.

1169
01:31:14,170 --> 01:31:15,410
Follow me.

1170
01:31:34,850 --> 01:31:38,500
- The fuck is this?   - I have no idea.

1171
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:39,930
What you're playing with...

1172
01:31:40,030 --> 01:31:42,790
is a prototype personal trans-atmospheric vehicle.

1173
01:31:42,890 --> 01:31:46,310
It was develpoped as part of Reagan's Star Wars project.

1174
01:31:46,310 --> 01:31:48,290
It's pretty basic, but it should still work.

1175
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:50,890
We're going to take out one of Valentine's satellites.

1176
01:31:51,190 --> 01:31:53,690
We're gonna break the chain, stop the signal.

1177
01:31:53,890 --> 01:31:55,890
It will take him a couple of hours to reboot it.

1178
01:31:56,090 --> 01:31:58,160
Which buys us enough time for you to

1179
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:00,250
get me into Valentine's mainframe...

1180
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:02,350
so I can shut it down.

1181
01:32:02,690 --> 01:32:06,670
Lancelot, you are going to be using it. Get into your halo suit.

1182
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:21,460
The Swedish Prime Minister requesting permisstion to land.

1183
01:32:26,650 --> 01:32:28,540
Permission granted.

1184
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:34,250
- Please.   - Thank you.

1185
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:38,410
- So how many more are we expecting?   - Not many. Most have their own bunkers.

1186
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:41,720
I figure we're just getting really nervous once.

1187
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:43,940
Welcome, Prime Minister.

1188
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:48,930
It seems the implant can emit some kind of counter signal...

1189
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:52,420
to ensure the wearer remains unaffected by the waves from the SIM card.

1190
01:32:52,630 --> 01:32:53,680
The waves that turns everyone

1191
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:54,830
into a psycho killer?

1192
01:32:54,930 --> 01:32:57,470
Quite. But what they probably didn't tell anyone...

1193
01:32:57,670 --> 01:32:59,210
is that it can also super heat

1194
01:32:59,210 --> 01:33:01,590
their soft tissue at his command.

1195
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:05,990
Valentine's selected his chosen few together countdown a warning.

1196
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:09,210
He had to be sure that it didn't blow up to the wrong people beforehand.

1197
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:11,250
And how does this help us right now?

1198
01:33:12,210 --> 01:33:14,910
It doesn't. Roxy, here we go.

1199
01:33:27,590 --> 01:33:30,850
The higher you go, The more the balloons expand.

1200
01:33:31,290 --> 01:33:34,790
When you reach the edge of the atmosphere, they will explode.

1201
01:33:35,490 --> 01:33:38,200
You need to deploy your missile just before that, okay?

1202
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:39,110
The edge of the atmosphere.

1203
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:42,480
And once you've deployed, you'll need to release for descent fast.

1204
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:44,720
Good luck.

1205
01:33:46,970 --> 01:33:48,560
You can do this, okay?

1206
01:33:49,210 --> 01:33:52,000
Eggsy, come on. Time is not our friend.

1207
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:18,240
Getting in with Arthur's invitation, you'll have to blend in.

1208
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:22,060
- I'm supposed to be Arthur?   - His invitation's in his phone.

1209
01:34:22,190 --> 01:34:24,640
Give them this and give his real name:Chester King.

1210
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:27,330
- And what about you?   - I'm the pilot. I'm gonna stay here.

1211
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:31,830
- Is that gonna fit me?   - A bespoke suit always fits.

1212
01:34:32,130 --> 01:34:35,630
Just be grateful Harry had it made for you. Get dressed.

1213
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:39,170
The fuck's wrong with them?

1214
01:34:39,170 --> 01:34:41,520
I don't know. Could have something to do with mass genocide?

1215
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:43,700
Give me the mic.

1216
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:46,700
Hey yo.

1217
01:34:47,110 --> 01:34:48,610
Everybody listen up.

1218
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:52,510
What the fuck wrong with you people?

1219
01:34:52,710 --> 01:34:58,200
I just want to remind you that today is a day of celebration.

1220
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:04,830
We must put aside all talks of death, and focus on birth.

1221
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:08,930
The birth of a new age.

1222
01:35:09,290 --> 01:35:13,490
We mustn't mourn those who give their lives today.

1223
01:35:14,290 --> 01:35:16,690
We should honor their sacrifice.

1224
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:18,680
She got my number to call me back...

1225
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:22,480
And their role in saving the human race.

1226
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:29,310
We must put aside doubts and guilt.

1227
01:35:29,370 --> 01:35:33,570
You are the chosen people.

1228
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:39,460
When folks tell their kids the story of Noah's Ark, is Noah the bad guy?

1229
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:42,660
Is God the bad guy?

1230
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:45,960
How about the animals marching two by two?

1231
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:47,950
Of course not.

1232
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:53,550
Yes, that's it. So let's turn that frown upside down.

1233
01:35:54,150 --> 01:35:59,860
Eat, drink and party.

1234
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:03,740
And I'll see you all in the new age.

1235
01:36:28,710 --> 01:36:31,950
Rox, it`s me. How's the view?

1236
01:36:34,910 --> 01:36:37,300
- Hideous.   - Mine's pretty sweet.

1237
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:40,250
- They made you one of these suits yet?   - No, not yet.

1238
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,410
You got some to look forward to then.

1239
01:36:42,410 --> 01:36:45,520
We're coming up on Valentine's base. Gotta go.

1240
01:36:46,990 --> 01:36:48,290
Good luck.

1241
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:57,480
You're looking good, Eggsy.

1242
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:01,830
Feeling good, Merlin.

1243
01:37:07,470 --> 01:37:11,510
This is November 2-4-7 Charlie Kilo requesting permission to land.

1244
01:37:14,670 --> 01:37:16,170
Permission is granted.

1245
01:37:21,110 --> 01:37:23,490
Fuck me.

1246
01:37:50,730 --> 01:37:52,130
Eggsy. We're on.

1247
01:38:07,010 --> 01:38:08,210
Chester King.

1248
01:38:08,910 --> 01:38:10,630
Mr. King, welcome.

1249
01:38:10,810 --> 01:38:14,090
I'm sure you've adhered to Mr Valentine's

1250
01:38:14,090 --> 01:38:15,180
strict no weapons policy ...

1251
01:38:15,310 --> 01:38:17,400
- but if you don't object..   - Of course.

1252
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:20,690
Do you have any luggage?

1253
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:25,600
Congratulations, Mycroft. You just graduated from my pilot to my valet.

1254
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:29,190
- You cheeky.   - Understood? Good.

1255
01:38:30,790 --> 01:38:32,040
Thank you.

1256
01:38:58,060 --> 01:39:03,060
Eggsy, find a laptop. Get me online. The clock is ticking.

1257
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:06,260
And remember :Try to blend in.

1258
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:08,550
Would sir care for a drink?

1259
01:39:09,050 --> 01:39:12,950
Martini. Gin, not vodka, obviously.

1260
01:39:13,050 --> 01:39:18,040
Stirred for 10 seconds while glancing it an unopened bottle of vermouth. Thank you.

1261
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:25,140
- Merlin, you clock in this?   - Yes I am. Stay focused.

1262
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:28,330
Lancelot, you're doing great.Not much further to go.

1263
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:29,830
Yes, Merlin.

1264
01:39:31,330 --> 01:39:33,530
Eggsy, get me online. Now.

1265
01:39:34,830 --> 01:39:36,030
Yep. I'm on it.

1266
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:39,930
Lancelot, you're approaching your altitude limit.

1267
01:39:39,930 --> 01:39:41,620
These balloons won't last much longer.

1268
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,020
start to engage missile.

1269
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:02,600
The society is dead. Long live society.

1270
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:05,300
Amen to that.

1271
01:40:07,090 --> 01:40:08,540
Morten Lindstr.

1272
01:40:08,540 --> 01:40:10,590
Chester King. How'd you get online? I couldn't...

1273
01:40:10,690 --> 01:40:14,470
Oh well, it's a closed network, you see. For authorized connections only.

1274
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:19,780
I've got a fix on the satellite.

1275
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:22,840
Do you have the correct time? I think I'm still on my last time zone.

1276
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:24,080
Oh yeah. Lets see now.

1277
01:40:38,030 --> 01:40:40,660
- Eggsy, I'm in. Get your arse back to the plane now.   - I'm on my way.

1278
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:44,260
Lancelot, good luck. Firing in three, two...

1279
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:52,650
Nice and slow.

1280
01:40:52,750 --> 01:40:54,280
What the fuck are you doing here?

1281
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:56,230
Well, my family was naturally invited. Obviously.

1282
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:58,350
Now get the fuck up. Slowly.

1283
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:02,860
Shit. Lancelot, hurry up and fire. The other balloon is gonna blow.

1284
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:06,110
Yes, Merlin. I've nearly got it. Give me a second.

1285
01:41:07,930 --> 01:41:10,910
Valentine, I've caught a fucking spy.

1286
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:12,930
V-Glass, zoom.

1287
01:41:13,870 --> 01:41:15,870
Oh fuck. It's that young valet.

1288
01:41:18,770 --> 01:41:20,240
Son of a bitch.

1289
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:21,510
Got it.

1290
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:33,500
Oh shit. Sound the alarm.

1291
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:37,530
I'm not taking any chances.

1292
01:41:37,530 --> 01:41:41,010
Okay, you send out the two-minute warning. I'm starting the override.

1293
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:43,890
Countdown initiated.

1294
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:55,280
- You see him?   - Over here.

1295
01:42:04,170 --> 01:42:07,360
Eggsy, take a left. Two guards up ahead.

1296
01:42:19,650 --> 01:42:21,350
Lancelot, release now.

1297
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:34,840
Eggsy, straight ahead and then right. There's two more.

1298
01:42:38,730 --> 01:42:42,130
Alright, everybody on your feet. Countdown to V-Day.

1299
01:42:42,230 --> 01:42:43,930
Welcome into new age.

1300
01:42:51,770 --> 01:42:52,970
Downward spiral

1301
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:11,370
Eggsy, next left. Got a narrow tunnel.

1302
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:21,300
Here we go.

1303
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:22,020
Ten...

1304
01:43:22,490 --> 01:43:23,290
Nine...

1305
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:25,160
Eight...

1306
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:27,200
Seven...

1307
01:43:27,390 --> 01:43:29,390
Six...

1308
01:43:29,410 --> 01:43:30,510
Five...

1309
01:43:31,430 --> 01:43:33,280
Four...

1310
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:37,270
Three, two, one ...

1311
01:43:43,650 --> 01:43:46,000
Nice. Well done, both of you.

1312
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,360
It's not working.

1313
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:49,460
It's supposed to be working. What the fuck?

1314
01:43:56,450 --> 01:43:58,150
Well done, Rox. Good girl.

1315
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:03,810
We've lost one of our satellites.

1316
01:44:13,850 --> 01:44:17,800
Oh no no. There's no way I can hack past that.

1317
01:44:22,730 --> 01:44:26,230
What's going on? Is there a problem?

1318
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:30,320
C'mon, there's no need for guns. I'm just a pilot.

1319
01:44:33,990 --> 01:44:35,990
Fuck! Merlin!

1320
01:44:37,010 --> 01:44:38,510
Get in here.

1321
01:44:42,910 --> 01:44:44,050
Come on.

1322
01:44:47,820 --> 01:44:50,260
- Let's get the fuck out of here.   - I can't.

1323
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:54,390
I can't get into Valentine's machine. It's got biometric security.

1324
01:44:55,060 --> 01:44:58,070
You're gonna have to get in there and make sure his hand never touches that desk.

1325
01:44:58,450 --> 01:45:01,080
- You taking a fucking piss?   - I'm afraid not.

1326
01:45:04,860 --> 01:45:06,560
Set that then.

1327
01:45:07,130 --> 01:45:10,680
This is mine. I'll show you yours.

1328
01:45:28,630 --> 01:45:30,000
Good choice.

1329
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:34,040
How long to relink the satellite chain?

1330
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:35,520
It can take an hour. Maybe two.

1331
01:45:35,620 --> 01:45:38,020
Bullshit. Just bring these two closer together.

1332
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:39,370
But that's not yours.

1333
01:45:44,650 --> 01:45:46,590
V-glass, call E-man.

1334
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:51,270
E, its V. Listen man, I got a little hickup on this end;

1335
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:52,140
I need a piggyback.

1336
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:54,000
One of my satellites just went down but is right next to one of yours.

1337
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,100
One of my satellites just went down but is right next to one of yours.

1338
01:45:56,740 --> 01:46:00,430
You read my mind. How long before you make that happen?

1339
01:46:03,430 --> 01:46:04,600
Go.

1340
01:46:08,620 --> 01:46:10,620
We should be coming back online.

1341
01:46:19,310 --> 01:46:21,510
Valentine using someone else's satellite.

1342
01:46:21,510 --> 01:46:24,310
He's gonna reconnect the chain. Its gonna take him no time at all.

1343
01:46:24,610 --> 01:46:26,110
He sits at 20%.

1344
01:46:44,190 --> 01:46:47,380
Eggsy, Valentine's got a present for you. Get a move on.

1345
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,600
Is that Kingsman dead yet?

1346
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:23,950
Not yet, but he will be soon.

1347
01:47:24,450 --> 01:47:25,690
Good.

1348
01:47:39,070 --> 01:47:40,790
Merlin, I'm fucked.

1349
01:47:53,220 --> 01:47:54,390
As am I.

1350
01:47:54,210 --> 01:47:56,850
They're coming at me from both sides. I'm out of options.

1351
01:47:57,010 --> 01:47:59,510
Rox, I need a favor.

1352
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:01,300
Call my mum and tell her

1353
01:48:01,310 --> 01:48:04,510
to lock herself away from Dean and the baby.

1354
01:48:06,010 --> 01:48:07,500
And tell her I love her.

1355
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,490
Oh for fuck sake.

1356
01:48:21,790 --> 01:48:25,290
Merlin, you remember those implants you said were of no use to us?

1357
01:48:26,540 --> 01:48:28,470
Any chance you could turn them on?

1358
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:34,980
Alright, my turn to play, Valentine.

1359
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:45,870
Oh no. What the fuck is he doing?

1360
01:48:45,870 --> 01:48:47,860
I can't stop this.

1361
01:49:00,770 --> 01:49:02,210
Yes, please.

1362
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:06,250
SECURITY IMPLANTS ACTIVATED

1363
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:08,490
No!

1364
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,570
Oh my god.

1365
01:50:05,580 --> 01:50:07,460
That was fucking spectacular.

1366
01:50:07,690 --> 01:50:10,030
Merlin, you're a fucking genius.

1367
01:50:10,490 --> 01:50:13,820
What the fuck is happening out there?

1368
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:19,870
Aren't you that princess who went missing?

1369
01:50:19,870 --> 01:50:21,150
Can you get me out?

1370
01:50:21,370 --> 01:50:23,390
Well if I do, will you give me a kiss?

1371
01:50:23,390 --> 01:50:24,870
I've always wanted to kiss a princess.

1372
01:50:24,970 --> 01:50:26,960
If you get me out right now, I will give you more than just a kiss.

1373
01:50:29,150 --> 01:50:30,460
You motherfucker.

1374
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:34,760
Did you really think I was stupid enough to implant one of those things in my own head?

1375
01:50:35,060 --> 01:50:36,750
What are you? Fucking crazy?

1376
01:50:37,750 --> 01:50:40,250
All those innocent people killed themselves for what?

1377
01:50:40,950 --> 01:50:43,650
You didn't stop shit.

1378
01:50:45,350 --> 01:50:47,570
Fine, I have locked the door. What do you want me to do now?

1379
01:50:47,570 --> 01:50:50,540
As I said, put your daughter in the bathroom and throw away the key.

1380
01:50:51,140 --> 01:50:53,290
It's still happening.

1381
01:50:53,490 --> 01:50:55,910
- You fucking insane.   - Just do it.

1382
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:24,880
Eggsy, the signal's started.

1383
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:27,700
Get Valentine's hand off that bloody desk now.

1384
01:51:27,900 --> 01:51:30,400
Sorry, love. Gotta save the world.

1385
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:33,980
If you save the world, would you do the asshole?

1386
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,620
I'll be right back.

1387
01:51:35,090 --> 01:51:36,210
Good luck.

1388
01:51:42,980 --> 01:51:44,100
London.

1389
01:52:12,210 --> 01:52:13,340
Rio.

1390
01:52:29,110 --> 01:52:30,240
Get down.

1391
01:52:31,940 --> 01:52:33,130
You did it.

1392
01:52:42,530 --> 01:52:44,450
This glass is not gonna hold long.

1393
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:47,740
You stay here.

1394
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:51,830
Merlin, quickly. How do I get up there?

1395
01:52:51,830 --> 01:52:53,320
Keep shooting. I'll find a route.

1396
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:54,590
Understood.

1397
01:53:10,210 --> 01:53:11,080
Holy fuck.

1398
01:53:29,930 --> 01:53:30,930
We are back up.

1399
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:33,270
Back up!

1400
01:53:40,570 --> 01:53:42,070
This is great.

1401
01:53:50,410 --> 01:53:52,140
Eggsy, fucking get off his hand.

1402
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:54,530
Kick his ass, darling.

1403
01:54:00,750 --> 01:54:03,440
Seoul, Caracas, Mumbai.

1404
01:54:12,090 --> 01:54:14,430
Kill your motherfucker. Kill your all friends.

1405
01:54:31,850 --> 01:54:33,780
Eggsy, the world is going to shit.

1406
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:45,300
- Is he dead yet?   - Not yet.

1407
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:48,100
Stop playing with your food. Kill him.

1408
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:10,920
Gazelle. Gazelle

1409
01:56:20,910 --> 01:56:22,910
Come on.

1410
01:56:25,410 --> 01:56:26,600
Kill him.

1411
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:11,060
Well done son.

1412
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:14,050
Yes. Yes, Eggsy.

1413
01:57:14,550 --> 01:57:18,050
Well done, Eggsy. And you, Lancelot.

1414
01:57:20,450 --> 01:57:22,700
I am so sorry. Mommy would never hurt you.

1415
01:57:23,690 --> 01:57:26,140
Mommy would never hurt you. I am so sorry.

1416
01:57:29,310 --> 01:57:30,440
You ok?

1417
01:57:34,130 --> 01:57:36,130
Harry would be proud of you, Eggsy.

1418
01:57:37,330 --> 01:57:38,530
He was right.

1419
01:57:54,110 --> 01:57:55,900
'Sup man?

1420
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,710
Is this the part where you say some really bad pun?

1421
01:58:00,510 --> 01:58:02,410
It's like you said to Harry:

1422
01:58:05,660 --> 01:58:07,860
This ain't that kind of movie, bro.

1423
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:10,700
Perfect.

1424
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:35,470
Eggsy, where're you going? There's no need for champagne. We have got lots on the plane.

1425
01:58:42,670 --> 01:58:45,860
- Did you save the world?   - Yes i did.

1426
01:58:48,650 --> 01:58:52,200
- You gonna come in?   - Yes, I am.

1427
01:58:57,330 --> 01:58:59,630
Merlin, this door's locked. How do I get in?

1428
01:59:01,950 --> 01:59:03,530
26 25.

1429
01:59:07,830 --> 01:59:10,590
Merlin, you're the governor.

1430
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:14,830
You owe me, Eggsy.

1431
01:59:20,450 --> 01:59:22,360
Eggsy?

1432
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:29,200
Oh my world.

1433
02:00:16,390 --> 02:00:19,280
Michelle, turn that shit off, its turning me nutsy.

1434
02:00:20,120 --> 02:00:21,960
I rather like that song.

1435
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,910
Leave it on, Mom.

1436
02:00:27,290 --> 02:00:29,310
Mugsy's back.

1437
02:00:29,620 --> 02:00:31,620
You finally come to have that word with me, have you son?

1438
02:00:32,270 --> 02:00:35,480
Or are you going to run away again and pretend you're getting another coat dress like that?

1439
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:37,580
You mean this?

1440
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:40,170
No.

1441
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:42,260
I know this bloke who's just taken over

1442
02:00:42,260 --> 02:00:43,850
a tailor shop up on Seville Road.

1443
02:00:44,210 --> 02:00:46,210
He's got me a job, Mom.

1444
02:00:46,990 --> 02:00:48,990
Comes with a lot of perks.

1445
02:00:49,630 --> 02:00:51,630
Including a house.

1446
02:00:52,430 --> 02:00:54,420
Come and live with me there, Mum.

1447
02:00:55,050 --> 02:00:57,050
- Come on.   - Sit down, you.

1448
02:00:58,180 --> 02:01:01,430
Only place she'll be visting is you in fucking hospital, d'you hear?

1449
02:01:01,530 --> 02:01:04,980
Just leave him alone. Eggsy, go please. Just go away.

1450
02:01:06,140 --> 02:01:07,640
Alright.

1451
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:09,470
Yes, just do as mommy says.

1452
02:01:09,570 --> 02:01:12,500
Find yourself a tailor and think that chicken costume's gonna suit you,

1453
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:13,800
you mug.

1454
02:01:16,690 --> 02:01:19,150
As a good friend once said:

1455
02:01:20,410 --> 02:01:21,750
Manners...

1456
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:24,520
maketh...

1457
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:28,960
the man.

1458
02:01:29,310 --> 02:01:31,190
- Dean?   - Shut the fuck up.

1459
02:01:31,380 --> 02:01:33,720
Eggsy, I'm gonna shove your manners up your fucking...

1460
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:40,880
So...

1461
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:45,240
Are we going to stand here all day, or are we going to fight?

1462
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,750
1997年 中东

1463
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,630
这是零一阿尔法,我们已控制住了猎鹰

1464
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,230
重复,我们已经控制住了猎鹰

1465
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,100
在我数到十之前

1466
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,220
把你知道的所有情报说出来

1467
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,320
否则,十就是你最后听到的数字

1468
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,020
一、二、三

1469
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,270
四、五、六、七、八

1470
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,610
手榴弹,快闪开

1471
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,490
见鬼

1472
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,590
居然没发现

1473
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,690
我他妈的我怎么会没发现...

1474
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,880
梅林,很抱歉让你身处这般境地

1475
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,780
你把他训练得很好

1476
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,370
詹姆斯,你的训练结束了

1477
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:46,170
- 欢迎加入皇家特工,兰斯洛特  - 谢谢长官

1478
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,560
我会亲自收拾烂摊子的

1479
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,650
伦 敦

1480
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,030
我表示非常遗憾

1481
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,350
你丈夫的英勇事迹无法公之于众

1482
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,690
- 希望你能谅解  - 你让我如何去谅解

1483
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,600
你什么都不告诉我

1484
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,480
我甚至知道他已经不在原来的部队了

1485
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,760
恕我不能多言

1486
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,840
但我希望你能收下这枚英勇勋章

1487
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,230
仔细看背面,那里有一串号码

1488
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,210
为了表示感激

1489
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,830
我们想要给你...

1490
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,290
可以称之为"帮助",帮什么忙由你决定

1491
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,970
你只要跟接线员说,"牛津鞋,不要布洛克鞋"

1492
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,220
我们就知道是你了

1493
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,920
我不想要你的帮助

1494
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,010
我只想我的丈夫回来

1495
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,700
- 你叫什么名字,小家伙  - 艾格西

1496
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,300
你好,艾格西,能给我看看吗

1497
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,290
艾格西,你保管好这个,好吗

1498
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,380
还有照顾好你妈妈

1499
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,400
王 牌 特 工

1500
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,000
特 工 学 院

1501
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,650
阿根廷 十七年后

1502
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,700
非常抱歉,阿尔诺德教授,这确实过分了点

1503
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,370
天呐,快拿掉

1504
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,170
上头严令禁止伤害你

1505
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,520
听着,你们弄错了

1506
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,430
我只是一名大学讲师,没什么钱

1507
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,320
和钱无关,我们的老板只是想和你聊聊

1508
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,750
那我是不是可以放心了

1509
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,090
他马上就到,他会解释的

1510
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,110
你喜欢威士忌吗,里德,来一杯六二年的达尔摩

1511
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,030
真的,这酒非常好喝

1512
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,280
你会喜欢的

1513
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,330
我想找你们借一杯糖的话,不算是太过分吧

1514
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,660
阿尔诺德教授,我是来接你回家的

1515
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:34,470
1962年的达尔摩,洒出一点都是罪过

1516
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,130
你觉得呢

1517
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,480
能帮我拿着这些吗

1518
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,460
谢谢

1519
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,010
全都收拾好了

1520
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,040
我喜欢的欢迎方式

1521
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,700
血腥暴力让我倒胃口,绝非夸张

1522
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,020
要是我看到一滴血,那我就完了

1523
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,920
我会条件反射般的...狂吐

1524
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,710
听着,十分抱歉让你目睹这令人不快的场面

1525
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:17,210
都怪这个不速之客,但我承诺

1526
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,500
等我查出他为谁效力时

1527
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,300
你和我会成为好朋友的

1528
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,520
请载我到店里

1529
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,000
萨维尔街 一号
威斯敏斯特市[伦敦内自治市]
注: 萨维尔街是世界最顶级西服手工缝制圣地

1530
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,400
金士曼裁缝店

1531
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,770
亚瑟在餐厅里,先生

1532
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,850
- 亚瑟  - 加拉哈德

1533
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,990
其它人都开始在想

1534
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,910
你不来的话,我们是否要再次举杯致敬了

1535
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,950
先生们,我很欣慰,过去的十七年里我们

1536
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,440
没有机会用这个酒瓶

1537
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,330
兰斯洛特是一位杰出的特工,一个名副其实的王牌特工

1538
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:34,230
我们会深切怀念他,敬兰斯洛特

1539
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,380
敬兰斯洛特

1540
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,260
我打算明天开始选拨

1541
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,120
替代兰斯洛特位置的人

1542
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,800
我希望你们每个人

1543
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,590
都提名一位候选人,并上报给英国总部

1544
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,610
最晚不超过格林威治时间晚上九点前,谢谢

1545
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:01,280
梅林,请进

1546
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,960
兰斯洛特当时在调查一伙雇佣军

1547
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,300
他们一直在进行生化武器的实验

1548
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,870
先生们,请戴上眼镜

1549
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,190
2012年,乌干达,合成卡西酮[毒品]

1550
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,190
被用于污染了陆军基地的供给水源

1551
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:22,280
狂怒,同类相食,导致多人死亡

1552
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,080
2013年,车臣,叛乱分子相互攻击

1553
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,500
毫无疑问,也是这些雇佣兵的杰作

1554
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,970
但没有查出任何化学制品

1555
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,980
那兰斯洛特是怎么死的

1556
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,160
在追踪过程中,他发现了他们在阿根廷的房产

1557
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,220
在监视他们的同时

1558
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,560
还察觉到他们实施了一起绑架案

1559
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,400
于是他单独执行了营救任务,结果失败了

1560
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,500
这是他最后传送回来的画面

1561
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,900
绑架受害者是詹姆斯·阿尔诺德教授

1562
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,480
- 他是谁  - 某个气候变化预言家

1563
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,930
提出了某种叫盖亚理论的假说

1564
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:58,750
盖亚假说由英国大气学家
詹姆斯·洛夫洛克在20世纪60年代末提出

1565
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,150
认为世界能够自愈之类的

1566
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,750
但让人好奇的是,他并未真正失踪

1567
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,940
这就是阿尔诺德教授

1568
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,040
今天早上出现在帝国理工学院

1569
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:09,340
这交给你了,还有不要忘了上交候选人提名

1570
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,730
这次尽量挑个更合适的人选

1571
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,920
十七年都过去了

1572
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,390
你仍然不打算与时代同步

1573
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,490
我提醒你

1574
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,650
如果不是那个年轻人,我今天也不会坐在这里

1575
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,740
他是一块当王牌特工的料,甚至要比其他人更优秀

1576
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,920
但他最终没能成为我们的一员,不是吗

1577
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,610
面对现实吧,加拉哈德,你的小实验失败了

1578
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,520
恕我直言,亚瑟,可你真是个势利小人

1579
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,810
- 恕你直言  - 世界正在改变

1580
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,050
贵族们都长着短小下巴是有原因的

1581
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:46,050
短下巴被视作性格软弱

1582
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,080
艾格西

1583
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,250
艾格西,出来一下

1584
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,770
- 还有卷纸吗  - 没有

1585
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,460
为什么不帮你妈

1586
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,210
去楼下商店买点呢

1587
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,510
- 你自己去买  - 嘿

1588
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,350
和你说过不要这样和迪恩说话

1589
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,020
三个人多挤,怎么不叫迪恩的走狗去买

1590
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,570
要不这样吧

1591
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,190
拿着这些钱

1592
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,180
去买卷纸,顺便给你自己买点糖

1593
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,650
你出去之后

1594
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,630
我会让你妈妈见识下我们三人也能相处甚欢

1595
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,540
谢谢宝贝

1596
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,530
来吧

1597
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,540
给你这个

1598
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,330
好点了吧

1599
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,280
迪恩对你妈这么差,她为什么不离开他

1600
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,360
缺乏自尊,这就是问题所在

1601
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,880
滚蛋,她怎么可能没自尊呢

1602
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,620
他妈可性感了

1603
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,340
- 不要见怪,伙计  - 没关系

1604
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,650
总有一天,我要打烂他的脸

1605
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,090
兄弟,你疯了吗

1606
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,530
他会找那些家伙来对付你

1607
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,180
然后假装自己什么都...不知情

1608
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,710
别以为我们老大在泡艾格西的老妈

1609
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,470
你们在这瞎掰掰,我们不敢对你怎么样

1610
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,850
- 差不多吧  - 别这样

1611
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,550
我们走吧,伙计,不值得

1612
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,660
你们在这里坐得够久了,滚吧

1613
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,210
怎么

1614
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,210
抱歉,不好意思咯

1615
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,410
垃圾

1616
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:56,030
不值得跟他们一般见识,兄弟

1617
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,650
外面冷死了,我们为什么要走路呢

1618
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,950
你这家伙偷了他的车钥匙

1619
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,320
没错,我们还要玩坏他的车

1620
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,590
见鬼

1621
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,920
等等,伙计们

1622
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,190
妈的那车是我的

1623
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,560
艾格西

1624
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,000
我发誓,你们麻烦大了

1625
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,390
你他妈的死定了

1626
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,880
停下来

1627
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:30,990
我他妈要杀了你

1628
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,030
狂飙吧,艾格西

1629
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,740
迪恩,是我

1630
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,840
他妈艾格西刚偷了我的车

1631
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,710
我在酒吧门口,他当着我的面

1632
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,320
原地转了十五圈,然后直接把车开走了

1633
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:55,610
他不尊敬我,就是在蔑视你

1634
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,610
慢着,什么...

1635
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,150
见鬼

1636
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,540
狐狸不是什么好东西,你应该直接碾压过去的

1637
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,640
我应该做的事情可多了

1638
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,740
剩下的交给我,你们下车

1639
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,830
快他妈下车

1640
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,220
艾格西,小偷可没有正义同盟可言

1641
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,600
你最好供出

1642
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,020
当时和你一起的同伙名单...

1643
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,210
要么你蹲监狱,这完全取决于你

1644
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,040
我想行使我打电话的权利

1645
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,600
我希望是打给你妈的

1646
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,830
告诉她,你要十八个月后才能回家吃晚饭了

1647
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,190
客户投诉部,请问有什么能帮你

1648
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:04,060
我叫艾格西·安文,对不起,是加里·安文

1649
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,560
我遇到大麻烦了,我现在在市区的警察局

1650
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,280
我妈说如果我需要帮助可以打这个电话...

1651
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,850
对不起,先生,你打错电话了

1652
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,500
等等

1653
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,420
"牛津鞋,不要布洛克"

1654
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,740
您的投诉已受理

1655
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,640
希望我们不会失去您这样的忠实客户

1656
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,000
警察局

1657
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,730
什么

1658
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,570
但是...好

1659
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,720
是的,我完全理解

1660
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,020
艾格西.

1661
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,590
- 要搭便车回家吗  - 你是谁

1662
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,890
- 保释你出来的人  - 你还没有回答我的问题

1663
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,190
如果你能礼貌地说声谢谢就好了

1664
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,380
我的名字是哈利·哈特,那勋章是我给你的

1665
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,380
你的父亲救过我的命

1666
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,570
上好的麦芽酒和黑啤

1667
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,570
那你做裁缝之前,参过军吗,像军官那种

1668
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,760
不完全是

1669
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,270
你们当时被派遣去了哪,伊拉克还是别的地方

1670
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,570
抱歉,艾格西,这是机密

1671
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,460
但是我爸救了你一命,是吧

1672
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,760
你父亲去世那天,是我疏忽了

1673
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,240
如果不是他挺身而出

1674
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,750
我的错误会让在场的所有人都付出生命的代价

1675
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,800
所以是我欠他的

1676
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,850
你父亲是个勇敢的人,还是个好人

1677
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,310
查阅了你的档案后,我觉得

1678
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,440
你父亲他肯定会对你选择的人生失望透顶

1679
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,370
你没资格这样说我

1680
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,160
高智商,小学时表现极为出色

1681
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,070
然后一切都颠倒了

1682
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,340
吸毒,小偷小摸,游手好闲

1683
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,080
你以为工作满大街都是吗

1684
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,400
这解释不了你为何放弃了你的爱好

1685
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,530
你连续两年蝉联地区举办的十岁以下儿童

1686
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,080
体操比赛第一名

1687
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,220
你教练曾视你为奥运队的人才

1688
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,200
是啊,成长时期有那样一个继父在身边

1689
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,420
很快就会学到新的爱好

1690
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,220
总是把错误推到别人身上

1691
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,820
你退队又该埋怨谁呢

1692
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,510
你的训练才进行了一半,而且成绩优秀,但你却放弃了

1693
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,450
因为我妈变得神经兮兮的

1694
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,310
怕我会像我爸一样离她而去

1695
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,370
我们才不会给你们这样的势利小人当炮灰

1696
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,700
你们总是高高在上的,对我这样的人指手画脚

1697
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,820
但从没想过我们这样做的原因

1698
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,420
我们别无选择,知道吗

1699
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,150
如果我们和你一样,含着银汤匙出身

1700
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,570
即使不比你优秀,至少也能和你一样

1701
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,830
你他妈的还敢来这儿,好大的胆子

1702
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,810
这些年轻人也是

1703
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,680
只要有银制灵药就能成功的例子吗

1704
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,210
不,他们是例外,走吧

1705
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,080
为何,我们还没喝完呢

1706
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,770
你偷了他的车那一刻起

1707
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,370
迪恩说他不会罩你了,我才不管你妈怎样给你求情

1708
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,170
听着,小伙子们

1709
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,600
我今天心情不太好,所以

1710
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,630
不管你们对艾格西有什么不满,我相信都是事出有因的

1711
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,730
如果你们能让我们单独待会....

1712
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,830
让我好好喝完这杯可口的吉尼斯黑啤

1713
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,460
我将不胜感激

1714
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,860
你最好少管闲事,老头子

1715
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,260
拳头可是不长眼

1716
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,800
他不是开玩笑的,你走吧

1717
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,660
借过

1718
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,330
如果你想找个牛郎玩玩

1719
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,430
可以去史密斯街的转角处看看

1720
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,140
不知礼

1721
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,590
无以

1722
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,800
立也

1723
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,420
知道这句话的意思吗

1724
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,010
不知道的话让我就给你上一课吧

1725
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,320
我们是要这样傻站一整天

1726
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,700
还是要来痛快打一架

1727
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,030
你妈逼去死,他妈个王八蛋

1728
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,780
击昏

1729
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,020
消除记忆

1730
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,500
不好意思,我只是需要发泄一下

1731
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,340
昨天我有个朋友去世了

1732
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,390
其实他也认识你父亲

1733
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,090
真的很抱歉,艾格西

1734
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,080
我不该当着你面大打出手的

1735
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,030
不,拜托,我什么也不会说

1736
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,390
我发誓,从这一刻起,我会保持沉默

1737
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,060
你不会告诉别人吗

1738
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,480
事实上,我从没出卖过别人

1739
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,570
- 这是承诺吗  - 我以性命担保

1740
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,070
不胜感激,艾格西

1741
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:31,860
你说我是势利小人的话是正确的,但是也有例外

1742
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,860
祝你一切好运

1743
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:51,140
名人新闻,里奇蒙德·瓦伦丁的电影

1744
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,540
昨晚在好莱坞首映

1745
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,060
这个关于网络大亨崛起的故事

1746
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,150
是本季度获奖热门

1747
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:02,380
值得注意的是伊奇·阿萨里亚没有出席红毯仪式

1748
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,460
她在三天前就行踪不明...

1749
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,030
也没有出现在她个人的奥克兰演唱会上

1750
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,550
至今仍未收到有关赎金的要求...

1751
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,870
艾格西,快走,快,他要...

1752
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,800
- 求你了,别伤害他  - 滚开  - 别打他了

1753
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,200
滚开,给我他妈的闭嘴

1754
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,560
他妈的酒吧里和你一起的家伙是谁

1755
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,310
我要知道和你在一起的老东西是谁

1756
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,710
就我一个人

1757
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,320
- 是谁  - 我他妈的不知道你在说什么

1758
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,400
我不知道你在说什么

1759
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,220
妈的,快说出他的名字

1760
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,120
我他妈的不知道你在说什么

1761
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,260
听好了,我要你告诉我在酒吧里

1762
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,860
和你在一起的是谁,听懂了没

1763
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,960
妈的告诉我他的名字

1764
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,950
我发誓我要宰了你

1765
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,920
- 说啊  - 我他妈不知道你在说什么

1766
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,920
- 告诉我  - 快告诉他吧,艾格西

1767
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,480
滚开,滚开

1768
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,980
我现在就可以杀了你,而且没人会知道

1769
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,460
但我知道

1770
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,930
我手上掌握的证据足够让你在监狱里度过余生

1771
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,030
- 迪恩·安东尼·贝克先生  - 妈的是谁说话

1772
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,020
所以我建议你离那男孩远点

1773
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,760
不然我只能把证据送到相关部门那里

1774
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:09,410
艾格西,去我跟你说过的裁缝店来见我

1775
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,570
这他妈的到底什么情况

1776
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,020
妈的我看你这次怎么逃

1777
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,730
艾格西来了

1778
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,410
过来

1779
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,820
你个该死的,被我抓到你就死定了

1780
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,800
金士曼裁缝店

1781
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,910
我从来没见过裁缝

1782
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,520
但我知道你肯定不是

1783
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,430
跟我来

1784
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,260
进来啊

1785
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,450
你看见什么了

1786
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:31,590
一个想知道这他妈是怎么回事的人

1787
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,480
我看见了一个有潜力的年轻人

1788
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,580
一个忠诚的年轻人

1789
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:44,660
他可以完成使命而且想有所作为

1790
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,970
你看过电影"颠倒乾坤"吗

1791
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,970
没有

1792
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,460
那"尼基塔"呢,"风月俏佳人"呢

1793
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,460
好吧

1794
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,110
我想说的是

1795
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,160
没有含着银汤勺出生让你的人生有点曲折艰难

1796
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,550
但你可以选择改变

1797
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,820
只要你准备好适应并学习,你就可以逆转

1798
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:09,450
就像"窈窕淑女"里面那样吗

1799
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:15,040
你真让人惊喜,对,就像"窈窕淑女"那样

1800
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,840
现在,我给你一个成为王牌特工的机会

1801
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,630
- 裁缝吗  - 王牌特工

1802
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,730
- 像间谍一样  - 类似

1803
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:33,120
- 感兴趣吗  - 你觉得我还有可担心的吗

1804
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:43,740
从1849年起,金士曼就为

1805
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,310
世界上最有权势的人服务

1806
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,050
在1919年,他们中的一大部分人

1807
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,800
在一战中失去了继承人

1808
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,900
这意味着一大笔钱没有人继承

1809
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,500
许多掌权者都想要保卫和平,保护生命

1810
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,220
而我们的创建者意识到

1811
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,490
他们可以利用财富和影响力帮助更多的人

1812
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:08,490
我们的冒险就这样开始了

1813
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:14,510
一个拥有最高度自由裁判权的独立国际情报机构

1814
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,050
没有政治和官僚主义

1815
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,070
专门瓦解政府手下的间谍组织

1816
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,590
西装是现代绅士的铠甲

1817
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,970
王牌特工就是新时代的骑士

1818
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,860
- 这他妈究竟有多深  - 非常深

1819
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,020
糟糕,我们迟到了

1820
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,390
你爸爸也有过这种表情

1821
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,240
我也有过

1822
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,210
来吧

1823
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,080
加拉哈德,我的代号

1824
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:59,180
- 又迟到了,先生  - 祝你好运

1825
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,310
进去吧

1826
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,880
集合

1827
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,050
女士们先生们,我是梅林

1828
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:23,850
你们即将经历的可能是这世上最危险的工作面试

1829
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:28,950
你们当中仅有一人会成为下一个兰斯洛特

1830
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:34,140
有人知道这是什么吗,你说

1831
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,650
- 运尸袋,先生  - 正确

1832
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,640
- 查理是吧  - 是的,先生

1833
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,030
很好,一会儿你们每人拿一个运尸袋

1834
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,430
写上自己的名字

1835
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:47,830
你们还要在那个袋子上写上自己亲人的资料

1836
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:51,420
这意味着你们了解自己将面临的风险

1837
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,800
也表示你们同意遵守严格的保密协定

1838
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,620
如果不小心打破了协定

1839
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,410
你和你的亲人就用得上那个袋子了

1840
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,610
明白了吗

1841
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:10,000
很好,解散

1842
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,390
洛克希恩尼,但叫我洛克希吧

1843
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,990
- 我叫艾格西  - 蛋蛋  - 不,是艾格西

1844
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,330
蛋蛋,他们是在哪儿找到你的

1845
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,290
你知道我们不能谈论推荐我们的人

1846
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,230
那我们得把他灭口

1847
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,080
查理只是在闲聊,是吧,查理

1848
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,180
- 我叫迪格比  - 迪格比

1849
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,110
蛋蛋,这是卢夫斯,卢夫斯,这是蛋蛋

1850
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:45,270
- 那么蛋蛋,你来自牛津还是剑桥  - 都不是

1851
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,050
圣安德鲁斯,达勒姆

1852
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,870
等等我觉得我们可能见过

1853
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,720
在温切斯特加油站的麦当劳那儿是你给我点餐的吗

1854
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,560
不是

1855
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,070
一定是在圣安德鲁斯

1856
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,360
- 别理他们  - 你要笔吗

1857
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,220
- 谢谢  - 艾美利亚,是吗

1858
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,290
艾美利亚,这是艾格西

1859
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,820
你好,艾格西

1860
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,410
- 别理那些家伙  - 这也是我要告诉他的

1861
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,260
这只是唬人的把戏

1862
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,560
军队惯用的手段,没人会死

1863
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,490
真遗憾

1864
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:26,760
太好了,所以你不知道,中情局不知道

1865
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,540
没人知道这人是谁了吗

1866
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,940
没事,真的,没事

1867
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,540
并不是完全没事,但我不是为这来的

1868
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,390
哥们你了解我,我的问题不是钱

1869
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,500
我本可以直接从麻省理工退休

1870
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,190
找一个小岛颐养天年,让生意自己运作去吧

1871
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:48,520
没有人让我去拯救地球,是我自己想做的

1872
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:52,720
研究气候变化,游说政客,不断砸钱

1873
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,950
你知道为什么我放弃了吗

1874
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:59,820
因为我上一次检查的时候,地球还是一团糟

1875
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,580
所以我顿悟了

1876
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,610
钱是解决不了问题的

1877
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:09,900
那些自称为政治家的白痴们,他们都是缩头乌龟

1878
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,650
除了改选什么也不支持

1879
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,490
所以过去两年中我试着寻找一个真正的解决方案

1880
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,000
而我找到了

1881
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:24,380
现在,如果你真的想让世界变得更美好

1882
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,800
我建议你们竖起耳朵听好了

1883
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,940
因为我马上就要告诉你们了

1884
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,900
继续,瓦伦丁先生,我还在听

1885
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:37,170
只要你同意我所有的要求

1886
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,020
别惊慌,听我说,冷静

1887
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,020
妈的

1888
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,320
- 通气管  - 通气管

1889
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:38,360
- 淋浴器喷头  - 淋浴器喷头

1890
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,460
她是对的,走,快走

1891
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,830
去拉一下那道破门如何

1892
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,820
恭喜完成第一个任务

1893
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,420
查理,洛克希,干得好

1894
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,720
那些还没搞清楚情况的人听好了

1895
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,300
要是你用通气管插到马桶的U型部分

1896
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,010
你就有了无限的空气供给

1897
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,510
简单的物理知识,好好记住

1898
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:25,910
艾格西,发现那是个双向镜子真是好样的

1899
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,750
我见得多了去了

1900
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,200
你们可以把脸上的傻笑收回去

1901
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,260
因为在我看来你们每一个人都失败了

1902
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,690
你们都忘了最重要的事情

1903
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,790
团队合作

1904
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,970
好像不是经典军队唬人手段

1905
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:03,170
35、105

1906
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,970
就这样,就是这样

1907
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,720
你好,有什么可以帮到你

1908
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,150
是的,我有个关于人类起源对地球影响的问题

1909
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:21,290
真的吗,这个问题很值得探讨

1910
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,900
我的同事为了营救你而牺牲了

1911
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,780
你一定见识过他是多么的训练有素

1912
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,720
所以我建议你告诉我是谁绑架了你

1913
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,740
他们又为什么放了你

1914
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,860
我不知道你在说什么

1915
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,240
我不能说,那是...

1916
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,730
看在上帝的份上,我根本没用力,这人怎么...

1917
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,410
植入物已激活

1918
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,690
去他妈的,不管他是谁,我会...

1919
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:04,700
居然逼我杀了阿尔诺德教授

1920
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,600
我最他妈爱的阿尔诺德教授

1921
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,600
好消息是我们知道应急和监控系统运行良好

1922
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,740
你知道什么不是好消息吗

1923
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,140
"我的同事牺牲了",他那么说的

1924
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,370
这是个组织,他们正在全力追踪我们

1925
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,840
你跟哪些机构联系了...

1926
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,980
我说了,我联系克格勃(苏联),军情六处(英国)

1927
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,590
摩萨德(以色列)和北京

1928
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:25,490
- 他们都坚称那不是他们的人  - 北京

1929
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,680
中国秘密情报机关连个标识性的名字都没有

1930
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,280
还真是吓人啊

1931
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,280
不过,这样才叫秘密组织,对吧

1932
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,820
你知道吗

1933
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,270
让他们去死吧,我们得加快进度,把产品发布提前

1934
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:42,970
他们还在生产过程中,如果加快进度要花一大笔钱的

1935
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,170
你看我像在乎钱的样子吗,照我说的做

1936
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,820
正如你们昨晚所学到的一课

1937
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,860
在特工学院,团队合作至高无上

1938
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,350
在这里我们会增强你们的技巧,测试你们的极限

1939
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:03,350
所以你们要选一只小狗

1940
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,420
无论你去哪儿,你的狗都跟着你

1941
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,070
你要照顾它,训练它

1942
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,240
等它们训练有素之时,你们的训练也完成了

1943
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,940
那是特指你们当中能或者完成训练的人

1944
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,930
都明白了吗,去挑选一只小狗吧

1945
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:24,730
- 狮子狗吗  - 怎么,它们可是猎犬

1946
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:28,020
最古老的工作犬种,容易训练

1947
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,060
哈巴狗吗

1948
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,110
好歹也是条斗牛犬,不是吗

1949
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,130
它还是会长大的吧,不是吗

1950
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:42,130
见鬼

1951
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,500
核磁共振没有显示脑震荡的症状

1952
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,900
甚至没有直接脑外伤

1953
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,900
他多久能出院

1954
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,900
回答这个问题得花上百万去研究一下

1955
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,370
我们不知道他在那儿遭受了什么攻击

1956
00:39:58,370 --> 00:39:59,490
哈利的录像呢

1957
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:02,200
没发回到他家的终端吗

1958
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,210
加密了,没法破解

1959
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,770
要是他醒过来了

1960
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,680
或许你能找他问出密码

1961
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,180
他会没事的对吗

1962
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:15,280
我们得有耐心,艾格西,但希望还在

1963
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:19,870
要是我是你,我就专心训练,通过测试,让他骄傲

1964
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,460
来吧,J.B.,来吧

1965
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,140
我不要因为你变最后一名

1966
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,990
J.B.,再不走信不信我他妈毙了你

1967
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,350
梅林说我们不准抱着你们跑

1968
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,550
放他的狗屁

1969
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,880
水又来了

1970
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,550
找茬是吧

1971
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:34,620
艾格西,算了吧

1972
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,970
怎么了哥们,开不起玩笑啦

1973
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,010
真的,你会被开除,这根本不值得

1974
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,830
也许我他妈根本不在乎被开除

1975
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,220
真的吗,来吧,人生玩家

1976
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,320
查理,滚开

1977
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,930
滚远点,白痴

1978
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,980
好啦,J.B.,没事啦

1979
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:09,470
你们有一小时整来完成测试,现在开始

1980
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,250
新目标,800米

1981
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,260
真是难以置信,你还在这里

1982
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,660
跟一坨屎一样,冲都冲不走

1983
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:22,930
收到,目标已确认,你他妈就不能闭嘴吗

1984
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,430
正面差别待遇,真不值得

1985
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,600
就像有些人能进高等学府

1986
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,550
仅因为他们的老妈是一个断了腿的同性恋

1987
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,520
你他妈又不了解我的阶级

1988
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,840
哦,抱歉,我很肯定你接受过高等教育

1989
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,540
准备好就开枪

1990
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,430
这样的正面差别待遇如何

1991
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,320
谢谢二位的倾听

1992
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:58,810
我非常非常感谢您远道而来,尊敬的公主殿下

1993
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,080
您也一样,首相先生

1994
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,610
我觉得这个构想很绝妙

1995
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,800
这绝对是个绝妙的构想

1996
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,100
你完全疯掉了吧

1997
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,100
首相先生,请你清醒一点

1998
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,590
你竟然会考虑这样的事情,真是让我惊讶

1999
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:24,580
- 不,别碰我...  - 抱歉,公主殿下...

2000
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:26,520
要将斯堪的纳维亚地区拉回正轨

2001
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,880
你的角色至关重要

2002
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,980
你备受人民爱戴,具有感召力以及激励民众的能力

2003
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,980
如今不管你参不参加...

2004
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:41,070
我需要把你长期安置在一个能保证你的安全的地方

2005
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:44,370
你呢,首相先生,你是否要加入呢

2006
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:48,460
我觉得此时此刻,作为一名政治家,是该作出行动

2007
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,760
- 真正去改变世界了  - 太对了

2008
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,560
把她带走

2009
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:02,250
- 喝一杯吗  - 好啊

2010
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,640
警卫们,救救我

2011
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,440
别担心,公主不会受到任何伤害的

2012
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:14,040
反正我支持共和政体,所以真的无所谓

2013
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,430
放开公主

2014
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,700
好了,搞定了,不疼对吗

2015
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,890
- 我都没什么感觉  - 欢迎加入

2016
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:59,520
荣幸之至

2017
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:07,780
进来之前不知道敲门吗

2018
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,980
我计划入室抢劫前才会敲门踩点

2019
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,380
梅林说你要见我

2020
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,380
我希望J.B.的训练和你一样顺利

2021
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,600
坐下

2022
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,870
恭喜你成为最后六个候选人之一

2023
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:24,670
你的成绩比我预期的还要好

2024
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,240
进来

2025
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:36,170
艾格西,我要和哈利单独谈几句,你回避一下

2026
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:40,710
不用了,让他待着,说不定能学到点什么

2027
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:43,100
悉随尊便,来看看这个

2028
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,790
看在上帝的份上,我几乎没碰你,这人怎么...

2029
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:50,190
我靠,这也太过分了,哈利

2030
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,040
你把他头都爆了,这有点过了,不是吗

2031
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:57,830
实际上,爆炸是他脖子上的植入物引起的

2032
00:45:57,930 --> 00:45:59,750
在这儿,就在伤疤下面

2033
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:02,230
我的装备捕捉到它的触发信号了吗

2034
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:04,230
很幸运地捕捉到了

2035
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:06,220
但很不幸的是

2036
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,720
所追踪到的注册IP地址登记在瓦伦丁公司名下

2037
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:11,720
这线索没什么用,他们在全世界有几百万的员工

2038
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:14,420
不,里奇蒙德·瓦伦丁是个天才

2039
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:20,060
你们都没看他今天的发布会吗

2040
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:21,620
没有

2041
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:31,400
我们一年花在手机和网络上的费用平均要两千美元

2042
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,780
在此我很荣幸向大家宣布

2043
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:37,290
这样的时代要结束了

2044
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:40,920
从明天开始,每个男人,女人,还有孩子都能

2045
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,590
拿到一张免费的

2046
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:46,980
适用于所有手机和电脑的电话卡

2047
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:51,180
而且可以免费使用我公司的通讯服务

2048
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,780
免费电话,免费网络,人人共享

2049
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:58,200
永久有效

2050
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:16,990
瓦伦丁的助理也有相同的植入物疤痕

2051
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,450
我觉得我要和瓦伦丁先生来一次单独会晤了

2052
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:26,250
他下周有一场晚宴

2053
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:29,140
我帮你搞一张邀请函,但是你要万分小心

2054
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,400
在你卧床期间,已有上百个重要人物失踪了

2055
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,960
没有勒索信,和阿尔诺德教授的情况如出一辙

2056
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,090
那我建议你给我编造一个值得绑架的身份

2057
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,520
- 你恐高吗  - 是的,还可以,但我以前做过

2058
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,110
要是我不想着可能还好一点

2059
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:03,110
嘿,你会没事的,你是成绩最优异的学员之一

2060
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:07,970
听好,你们的任务是避开雷达的追踪

2061
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:09,000
降落在指定地点

2062
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,590
如果我在雷达上追踪到你们

2063
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:13,110
或者没降落到指定地点,那就打包回家吧

2064
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,800
都明白了吗

2065
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:20,390
即将到达降落区域,还有二十秒

2066
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:22,990
出发了

2067
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,610
艾格西,我觉得我真的不行

2068
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:35,590
你当然不行

2069
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:37,570
闪到后面去,我来教教你怎么做

2070
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,220
- 来吧  - 跳吧

2071
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,550
艾格西,等等,等一下

2072
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:50,030
洛克希,别想太多了

2073
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,060
跟着我跳,好吗

2074
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,190
来吧

2075
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,840
洛克希,现在不跳就没机会了

2076
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,090
跳啊

2077
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,600
好姑娘,洛克希,真高兴你做到了

2078
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:52,280
好极了

2079
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,290
哦,你们看起来心情都不错嘛,真以为会这么简单吗

2080
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:01,790
白痴都能看懂屏幕上的数字

2081
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:05,390
身为王牌特工,你得学会在高压环境下解决问题

2082
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:07,940
比方说你们之中有一个人

2083
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,180
没有降落伞的情况下该怎么办

2084
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:13,980
什么,没有降落伞,是谁

2085
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:17,590
- 操,是谁  - 我们该怎么办

2086
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:18,950
我告诉过你们要降落在目标上

2087
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,970
而且不能被雷达发现

2088
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:22,280
希望我不用将

2089
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,980
某人从地上铲出来

2090
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,550
但如果你真能摔进目标里

2091
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,760
我会对你刮目相看的

2092
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,360
所有人听着,我有个法子

2093
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:40,630
两人一组,抓住离你最近的人

2094
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,950
卢夫斯,快点

2095
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,940
我操

2096
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,230
卢夫斯

2097
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,940
真该死,我过不来

2098
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:53,940
我操

2099
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,940
谢天谢地

2100
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:58,000
卢夫斯,你这个卑鄙小人

2101
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:02,360
我们现在成了奇数了,围成一圈吧

2102
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,920
操,好吧兄弟们,就这么做

2103
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,560
我们轮流打开降落伞

2104
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:15,830
找到那个倒霉蛋后,右手边的人就抓住他

2105
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,230
好的,艾格西

2106
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:20,230
好主意,艾格西,你们还有三十秒

2107
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:21,210
马上开始吧,快点

2108
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:23,210
我先

2109
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:26,210
操

2110
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,150
警告 高度过低

2111
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:31,150
下一个是我

2112
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,600
地面上见,兄弟们

2113
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:39,970
该我了

2114
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:45,190
操

2115
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,470
洛克希,不管发生什么,我都会抓住你,好吗

2116
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,840
好的,艾格西

2117
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:58,340
- 你先来,好吗  - 好

2118
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:08,510
艾格西,洛克希

2119
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:11,930
我操

2120
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:21,450
我操

2121
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:24,680
操

2122
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:26,980
坚持住

2123
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:51,550
雨果,迪格比,你们没落在K字标记上

2124
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:53,220
那就不能成为K的一员

2125
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:57,410
卢夫斯,你开伞太早,完全暴露在雷达上了

2126
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:59,510
你们三个,收拾东西回家吧

2127
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:05,610
艾格西,洛克希,恭喜你们,你们创造了新纪录

2128
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:08,210
直到300尺才开伞,够胆量

2129
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,800
漂亮地完成了又一项任务,解散吧

2130
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:14,990
抱歉长官,但你们他妈为什么选我当倒霉蛋

2131
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:17,120
我这个候选人的命就这么不值钱

2132
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,500
不不不,别这么跟我说话

2133
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:22,240
如果你要抱怨,到我耳边小声来说

2134
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,840
我来给你减轻一些负担吧

2135
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:05,050
德福里先生,见到你真高兴

2136
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:07,770
抱歉,我想我把日子记错了

2137
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:10,840
哦,不不,因为你的光临,我特地把晚宴取消了

2138
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:14,240
捐赠了这么多钱的人值得我为他准备一场私人晚宴

2139
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,740
请进

2140
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,010
谢谢

2141
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:22,400
我得说,我十分期待和你见面

2142
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:24,670
没有几个亿万富翁是我不认识的

2143
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:25,430
我想也是

2144
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:28,600
很显然,我让我的人去查了查你的生意

2145
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:30,830
发现您出身自一个富贵世家

2146
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,730
你是怎么赚到的

2147
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:35,020
主要是不动产,房地产市场

2148
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:37,910
没什么好隐瞒,如果你想知道的话

2149
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:40,840
啊,听着,我只是好奇你是个什么样的人

2150
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:41,710
我想你能理解的

2151
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:43,810
- 我理解  - 希望你饿了

2152
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:46,900
- 我饿坏了  - 好极了,请坐吧

2153
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:11,080
- 请给我来一份巨无霸  - 选得好

2154
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:14,580
但是没什么能敌得过两份秘制酱料的吉士汉堡

2155
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:17,970
- 和四五年的拉菲简直是绝配  - 经典搭配

2156
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:19,740
我推荐夹心面包

2157
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,870
搭配1937年滴金酒庄的酒作为甜点

2158
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:23,620
我喜欢

2159
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:27,460
你想捐钱给我的基金会是吗

2160
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:31,060
你应该知道我把这片地区的事项都停止了吧

2161
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:34,420
气候变化会影响着我们所有人,瓦伦丁先生

2162
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,550
而你是为数不多的和我想法一致的有权势之人

2163
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:40,620
我中断项目是因为没什么进展

2164
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,450
每一个研究最后都指向相同的结论

2165
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:45,740
碳排放只是个幌子

2166
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:48,740
无论我们做什么补救方法都只是徒劳

2167
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:50,570
你还挺懂的

2168
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:56,120
有时候我还挺嫉妒那些对自己的领域一无所知的人

2169
00:55:57,330 --> 00:55:59,330
就像阿尔诺德常说的

2170
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:02,430
"人类是唯一知道宿主的死期

2171
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:05,430
却还要带着这样的恐怖诅咒苟活的病毒"

2172
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:09,010
可没多少人知道他

2173
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,420
你喜欢间谍电影吗,德福里先生

2174
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:20,510
现在的间谍电影对我来说都有点太严肃了

2175
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:23,810
但那些老电影...精彩无比

2176
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:27,100
随时都能为我展示难以想象的戏剧化情节

2177
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,100
那些老邦德电影,哦,天哪

2178
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,900
我还是个孩子时,那可是我的梦想职业

2179
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,400
一个绅士间谍

2180
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:40,080
但我总觉得是反派角色造就了老邦德电影的辉煌

2181
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,930
在我还是个孩子的时候

2182
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:44,360
我总是幻想自己是个未来主义的自大狂

2183
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:49,440
可我们都要长大,真是遗憾

2184
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:55,380
祝你好胃口

2185
00:56:57,870 --> 00:57:00,970
再给我几天去考虑一下你的提议

2186
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:04,470
我会让人和你的人进行联系,然后就算谈妥了

2187
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:08,060
感谢这一顿,愉快的用餐[麦当劳快乐儿童餐]

2188
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,960
- 你想让我跟踪他吗  - 不用

2189
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,750
我在酒里放了纳米追踪器

2190
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:22,610
接下来的二十四小时我们都会知道他的一举一动

2191
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,450
最终会查出来他为谁工作了

2192
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,480
瓦伦丁根本不让我离开他的视线

2193
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,690
我在进去时只拍到这个

2194
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,930
南林地使命教会是个仇恨团体,总部在肯塔基州

2195
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:41,030
联邦调查局已经监视他们好几年了

2196
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:42,830
你觉得瓦伦丁是他们的资助人吗

2197
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:44,780
不知道,我还没发现他们有关联的直接证据

2198
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,280
但我会继续追查的

2199
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,820
哦,顺便一提,失踪名单又增加了一人

2200
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,950
现在多了斯堪的纳维亚的皇室成员

2201
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,820
迪尔德公主殿下

2202
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:01,810
放我出去,你这个疯子

2203
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:04,910
我说过了,你想什么时候出来都可以

2204
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:09,200
- 只要你同意我的条件  - 我不同意

2205
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,290
而且我也永远不会同意

2206
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:13,800
好吧

2207
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,460
贱货

2208
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:18,450
我们要见英国大使

2209
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:23,790
最近几周,失踪的名流人数还在继续增加

2210
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:27,880
与日俱增的压力迫使各国领导人作出回应

2211
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:31,180
我们在竭尽所能寻找迪尔德公主

2212
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:36,180
世界各国的政府和安全部队正在共同协作

2213
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,940
寻找这些绑架案的幕后黑手

2214
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:42,440
另一方面,全世界的人们都在

2215
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,470
不分昼夜地排队领取免费的电话卡

2216
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:48,260
P女士,你拿到卡了

2217
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,960
是啊,我排了一整天的队了

2218
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:55,460
慈善家里奇蒙德·瓦伦丁发起的史无前例的慷慨馈赠

2219
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,550
目前已经对外发送了十亿张电话卡

2220
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:00,150
稍息

2221
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,290
你们以为今天的任务都完成了吗

2222
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:06,450
大概还没

2223
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:10,440
- 派对  - 就在今晚,在伦敦

2224
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,240
- 这是谁  - 你们的目标

2225
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:17,210
你们的任务是利用你们学过的

2226
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:18,630
神经语言程序学知识去俘获照片中的人

2227
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:22,230
我说的"俘获",指的是肉体关系上的

2228
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:23,560
小意思

2229
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:28,160
- 女孩都喜欢糙汉子  - 那我们走着瞧

2230
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,220
那是一定的

2231
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,480
你好,抱歉,我必须要过来说一句

2232
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,110
"你的眼睛真是太美了"

2233
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:42,710
- 你带美瞳了吗  - 没有

2234
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:46,210
- 你肯定戴了  - 天哪,负面打压,这可搞笑了

2235
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:48,600
九十年代之后我就没见过有人尝试这么搭讪了

2236
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,500
你说什么

2237
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:52,960
"负面打压",即用一些负面的语言

2238
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,900
来打压漂亮女孩的社会价值

2239
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,000
这会让你想要赢得他的认可

2240
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,690
可笑的基础语言神经学伎俩

2241
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:02,900
只有我觉得这个香槟味道很奇怪吗

2242
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,190
每人爱好不同,哥们

2243
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:05,680
我想是因为这酒太廉价了

2244
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,880
你可以尝尝这个,味道很不错

2245
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,790
如果你对色诱技巧感兴趣的话

2246
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:10,080
这家伙就是教科书范本

2247
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,560
知道他刚才做了什么吗,这叫做"意见式开场"

2248
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,080
他用一个中性的问题来和你搭讪

2249
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:16,380
然后让大家都加入谈话

2250
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,370
因此你会注意到他这个人

2251
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:20,850
不是这样的,我只是在说香槟味道很怪

2252
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,570
索菲小姐,我是蒙塔戈·贺林

2253
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:23,670
接待处有电话找你

2254
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:26,190
- 马上回来  - 待会儿见

2255
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,110
待会见

2256
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,930
干得不错,洛克希,我现在感觉不太好

2257
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:30,690
你还好吧

2258
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:32,090
抱歉偷听你们说话

2259
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:35,650
但是想要把人带回家还有一个更简单有效的方法

2260
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:37,550
用迷幻药

2261
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:41,650
或者药效更加强劲的东西

2262
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:00,720
你他妈的是谁

2263
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:03,330
我在哪

2264
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:08,540
这把刀可以救你的命

2265
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:13,540
操

2266
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:15,730
我雇主想问你两个问题,艾格西

2267
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:21,160
金士曼是什么,哈利·哈特又是谁

2268
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,900
我不知道那是什么鬼

2269
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:25,310
艾格西,我刚杀了你那两个朋友

2270
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:27,730
因为他们也给我这样一个胡扯的答案

2271
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,450
快把绳子割断,求你了

2272
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,890
嘿,艾格西,金士曼值得你为之献身吗

2273
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:39,460
去你妈的

2274
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:55,680
恭喜,做得非常好

2275
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:01,360
- 其他人怎么样  - 洛克希完美地通过了测试

2276
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:04,570
查理是下一个,想看好戏吗

2277
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:07,160
好啊

2278
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,660
王牌特工真值得你送死吗

2279
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,120
不,他妈的不值得,我操,你问什么我都说,求你放开我

2280
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,770
切斯特·金就是亚瑟

2281
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:17,620
间谍机构的首领

2282
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:19,550
间谍机构叫做金士曼,快点放开我

2283
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:22,650
谢谢你,查理,非常感谢

2284
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:25,310
放开我啊,不是他妈说好的吗

2285
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:26,310
不

2286
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:38,530
我对你寄予了厚望,你这个不争气的废物

2287
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:41,930
很抱歉,求你给我解开绳子

2288
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:43,730
自己解吧

2289
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:47,920
亚瑟,亚瑟,求你了

2290
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,780
知道我爸是谁吗,老混蛋

2291
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:53,640
有人吗,来人啊

2292
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,580
加拉哈德,帕西瓦尔,恭喜

2293
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:58,050
你们的候选人已经

2294
01:02:58,050 --> 01:02:59,710
到了测试最后一个阶段

2295
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:03,600
按照传统,你们现在可以和他们共处二十四个小时

2296
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:07,200
艾格西,你要知道你父亲也曾走到这个阶段

2297
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:11,300
现在开始,没有任何安全保障,懂了吗

2298
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,300
很好,解散

2299
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:22,490
查理,是时候回家了

2300
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:23,220
去你妈的

2301
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,060
我老爸会知道的

2302
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:30,580
"尿还是不尿"

2303
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,350
这是我在巴黎

2304
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:35,230
丢下一个脏弹后的头条新闻

2305
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:37,460
德国队对英格兰队,1:5

2306
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:38,580
我错过了那场比赛

2307
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:41,730
我当时在五角大楼执行一项调查间谍的任务

2308
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,710
我的首次任务,我阻止了

2309
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:51,480
针对玛格丽特·撒切尔的暗杀行动

2310
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,560
并非所有人都因此而感激你

2311
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:56,770
艾格西,重点是根本不会有人会因为这些任务而感激我

2312
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:00,600
所有报纸的头版都只会是名人的无聊八卦

2313
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:02,240
因为这是金士曼的本质

2314
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,560
我们得深藏功与名

2315
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,000
一个绅士的名字

2316
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,040
只能在报纸上出现三次

2317
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:10,640
出生时,结婚时和死亡时

2318
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:14,140
首要的是,我们是绅士

2319
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,450
那真是的没戏了

2320
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:19,080
就像查理说的,我只是一介平民

2321
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:20,650
不是的,成为一名绅士

2322
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:22,890
和一个人的出身没有丝毫关系

2323
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:25,330
成为一名绅士只需要学习

2324
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:27,770
对,但怎么学呢

2325
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:29,710
好吧,第一课

2326
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:32,530
你在就坐前应该要先问问我

2327
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:37,580
第二课,学做美味可口的马提尼[鸡尾酒]

2328
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,000
好的,哈利

2329
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,130
我了个擦,痛死老子了

2330
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:48,040
是你自己要求用生物识别的

2331
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,200
安全系统,弄个简单的开关都不行吗

2332
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:55,200
简单的开关,这可是一台极其危险的机器

2333
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:59,790
只有像我一样富有责任心且理智的人才能操作

2334
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:02,980
要是落到坏人手中,就会发生不幸的灾难

2335
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,300
掌纹同步完成

2336
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:07,810
可以走了吗,妈的

2337
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:11,080
还没,现在看下这个,测试下教会那边

2338
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:15,180
这台是短程操作机器,用简单开关就行

2339
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:23,750
你要像窈窕淑女那样教我咬字发音说话得体吗

2340
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:25,310
没那么荒唐

2341
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:27,960
成为绅士和口音没关系

2342
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,660
就算赤身裸体也能从容不迫,这才是绅士

2343
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,240
就像海明威说的那样

2344
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:35,090
比自己同伴优秀,没什么可高尚的

2345
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:39,240
真正的高尚是比曾经的自己更优秀

2346
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,200
现在,成为绅士需要的第一样东西就是合身得体的西装

2347
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,690
我说的是定制西装,而不是直接买的现货

2348
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:51,200
金士曼的西装通常都防弹

2349
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,690
先去量下尺寸

2350
01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:55,220
无论你能不能得到这份职业

2351
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:58,480
在金士曼训练的日子会给你留下难忘而且有用的回忆

2352
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:02,480
很抱歉,先生,但是试衣间有人

2353
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:06,970
- 二号试衣间能用  - 这是他的第一次试衣

2354
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:09,620
怎能用二号试衣间呢

2355
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:13,570
等待期间不如我带你去参观下三号试衣间吧

2356
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:26,360
- 这次是要下还是上  - 都不是

2357
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,030
就这样吗

2358
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:31,950
当然不是,扳下你左手边的挂钩

2359
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,500
哇哦,非常非常赞

2360
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:48,590
你需要双鞋子来搭配西装

2361
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:52,790
有鞋带的都可称作牛津鞋

2362
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:56,090
这种有额外装饰的叫做布洛克皮鞋

2363
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:59,110
- "只穿牛津鞋,不穿布洛克  - 一生铭记"

2364
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:00,680
艾格西,这话要一生铭记着

2365
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:02,380
试试这双

2366
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:04,730
顺便说下,你武器测试分数非常好

2367
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,010
这些你已经很熟悉了

2368
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,070
这是我们常规任务的配备手枪

2369
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:11,250
很独特,正如你所见

2370
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:14,370
这种枪也能用猎枪弹在复杂的近距范围进行射击

2371
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:16,520
- 合脚吗  - 恩,不错

2372
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,460
那你来展示一下德国贵族的正式问候礼吧

2373
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:24,060
不是这样的,艾格西

2374
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:29,350
真酷炫

2375
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:32,260
以前,特工们的鞋后跟还有电话呢

2376
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:33,560
我要怎么收回去

2377
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:35,420
这东西上面涂有

2378
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:39,140
对人类最致命的神经毒素之一,千万要小心

2379
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,940
我觉得这东西相当有趣好玩

2380
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,730
是我们化学工程中最精致的典范之一

2381
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:50,440
毒药,服下的时候不会发作

2382
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,830
但在最适合的时机之下

2383
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:55,930
你就可以远程启动

2384
01:07:56,130 --> 01:07:57,220
预备模式

2385
01:07:58,300 --> 01:07:59,420
致命模式

2386
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:04,130
那这些呢,是干嘛用的,电击别人吗

2387
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:06,860
- 别开玩笑了,这是手榴弹  - 真的假的

2388
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,510
如果你想电击别人的话,那得用纹章戒指

2389
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:12,240
按照绅士的传统,纹章戒指应该要戴在左手上

2390
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,010
但金士曼戴哪只手都行,只要戴得顺手

2391
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:16,980
你只要触碰戒指后面的感应器

2392
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:18,100
戒指就会放出50000伏电

2393
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,300
那些呢,有什么特别之处

2394
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,600
没有,那只是特工界的时尚工艺品

2395
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:29,080
放回去,艾格西

2396
01:08:32,190 --> 01:08:34,690
时间刚好,这位绅士正试完衣服

2397
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:41,080
德福里先生

2398
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:47,870
真巧啊,我就是因为你才来这的

2399
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:49,700
你离开我家后

2400
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:52,940
我一直在找你那天穿着的那件酷毙的外套

2401
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,620
刚好我要去参加英国皇家赛马会

2402
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:56,860
很显然我需要一件这样的无尾礼服...

2403
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:00,060
于是我就来这了,你在这里干嘛呢

2404
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,760
你好啊,我是里奇蒙德·瓦伦丁

2405
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:06,240
这是我新的贴身男仆,我刚把他介绍给我裁缝

2406
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:09,150
又是一个巧合,我也带了个贴身仆人

2407
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:10,770
你有没有

2408
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:12,850
- 进一步考虑我的提议  - 当然有啊

2409
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,740
我手下马上

2410
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:17,540
就会和你联系了,我向你保证

2411
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:22,600
提醒一句,参加赛马会需要戴大礼帽

2412
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:28,330
我向你推荐圣詹姆斯街上的洛克帽子店

2413
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:32,550
- 你是说烟熏鱼吗  - 是与落网的"落"同音的字

2414
01:09:35,530 --> 01:09:38,650
有时候我听不懂你们这种人说的话

2415
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,520
腔调都古古怪怪的

2416
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:51,240
先生,有劳你帮他试衣

2417
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:07,090
现在我有一顶炫酷的大礼帽了

2418
01:10:09,090 --> 01:10:12,290
葛希尔,我们出发去赛马会吧

2419
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:15,620
你的帽子很好看,快点

2420
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:17,780
我要去见女王,别害我迟到了

2421
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:21,280
快啊,葛希尔,我们要迟到了

2422
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,680
去赛马会有多远,有多远

2423
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:31,870
- 先生,梅林说你想见我  - 坐下

2424
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,360
这狗真可爱,叫什么名字

2425
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:43,180
- J.B.  - 是詹姆斯·邦德(007)的缩写吗

2426
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:43,700
不是

2427
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:45,970
那是杰森·伯恩(谍影重重)吗

2428
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:46,500
不是

2429
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,150
是杰克·鲍尔(24小时)

2430
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:50,850
哦,不错

2431
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:53,520
虽然我不太想承认,艾格西

2432
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,950
但我觉得你可以成为像他们那样出色的特工

2433
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,000
拿着

2434
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:14,030
开枪把狗打死

2435
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:22,520
枪已上膛

2436
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:26,620
开枪把狗打死

2437
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,380
把枪给我

2438
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:19,360
至少那女孩都比你有种

2439
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:26,260
出去,我就知道你下不了手

2440
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:31,350
回家吧

2441
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:35,550
梅林,请洛克希进来吧

2442
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:04,320
欢迎加入皇家特工,兰斯洛特

2443
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:30,290
- 妈  - 艾格西

2444
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:33,790
天啊,你都去了哪里了,我担心死你了

2445
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:39,120
哦小黛西,你都长这么大了

2446
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:46,660
- 他在哪  - 我没事

2447
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:48,800
艾格西,求你了,别管我们的事了...

2448
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:52,050
不,我就不该留你独自一人在这里的

2449
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:54,570
现在该结束这一切了,我很快回来

2450
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:00,120
喂,迪恩

2451
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:02,850
小兔崽子,你回来了啊

2452
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:04,900
- 你现在连出租车都偷了吗  - 是啊

2453
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,610
是的,我要和你谈谈我妈眼睛上的淤青是怎么回事

2454
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:11,140
你想跟我谈的话,先下车

2455
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:13,070
老子要把你揍得屁滚尿流

2456
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:18,580
让你的走狗先回避,我就下车

2457
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,480
走吧,伙计们,你们只会听到两声响

2458
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:24,100
一个是我揍他的声音,另一个是他倒地的声音

2459
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:26,300
放马过来,小混蛋

2460
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:29,030
我看你有没有长进,你想打我吗

2461
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:29,910
你在干嘛

2462
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,500
哦,不,不,不,不要

2463
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:33,380
快从车里滚出来啊,你在搞什么鬼

2464
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:35,020
你这个没种的孬货

2465
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,840
快停下来,他还会继续打我妈的

2466
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:40,350
有种了再回来找我吧,小瘪三

2467
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:08,140
就因为他妈的一条狗,你放弃了一个大好机会

2468
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:11,590
然后你又偷我老板的车,让我蒙羞

2469
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:15,910
- 你为了得到工作竟然枪毙了一条狗  - 是的

2470
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:22,120
每次我干了坏事,皮克尔都会提醒我那段经历

2471
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:26,280
你杀了自己的狗还把它做成标本了

2472
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:28,170
你这个变态

2473
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:30,970
不是,我对它开了一枪后,把它带回家好生照顾

2474
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:34,270
直到十一年前,它患胰腺炎去世

2475
01:15:35,370 --> 01:15:37,850
枪里没有装子弹,艾格西

2476
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:40,420
他妈的没有装子弹

2477
01:15:40,730 --> 01:15:42,630
还记得艾美利亚吗

2478
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:44,870
她并没有溺亡

2479
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:47,550
她在柏林的技术部任职,她活得好好的

2480
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:49,200
必须得测试你们的极限

2481
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,650
金士曼只会在拯救同伴生命是才会拿自己的性命去冒险

2482
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:54,850
就像我父亲即使要赔上自己的命还是要救你那样吗

2483
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:57,270
你也把他做成标本存放在这里了吗

2484
01:15:58,640 --> 01:15:59,860
难道你看不出来

2485
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:01,840
我至今所做的一切都是为了补偿他吗

2486
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:08,590
哈利,听好了

2487
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:11,020
在瓦伦丁身上的窃听器中获得了一些重要信息

2488
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:13,760
知道我为什么喜欢用纸笔吗

2489
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:16,630
因为没人知道我写了什么

2490
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:20,320
我们的环球游说之旅大获成功

2491
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:23,100
各国政要名人都被我们拿下了

2492
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:26,370
就像当你在玩宾果游戏时所有号码都被划掉

2493
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:27,360
宾果:一种填格子游戏
第一个成功者以喊宾果表示取胜

2494
01:16:26,370 --> 01:16:26,940
宾果

2495
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:31,280
宾果游戏啊,你玩过那游戏,对吧

2496
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:33,410
我看起来像玩宾果游戏的人吗

2497
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,560
重点是

2498
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:39,950
如果我们明天在教堂的测试顺利的话

2499
01:16:39,950 --> 01:16:41,300
就可以放手大干了

2500
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,260
南林地使命教堂

2501
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,290
- 梅林,准备好飞机  - 好的

2502
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:50,090
- 很抱歉,我会...  - 你是该感到抱歉

2503
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:52,990
你待在这里,等我回来时再处理你的破事

2504
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:59,750
美国 肯塔基州

2505
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:02,180
我来告诉你们,这就是证据

2506
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:05,560
看看新闻,都看看新闻

2507
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:10,420
艾滋,洪灾,还有无辜生命挥洒的鲜血

2508
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:15,520
然而还有人在质疑上帝的愤怒是否真实

2509
01:17:17,610 --> 01:17:21,110
我们龌龊的政府竟然纵容肛交[同性恋]

2510
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:23,910
离婚、堕胎

2511
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:30,700
还有人觉得,这不是反基督的人所犯下的罪恶

2512
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:35,260
你是犹太人也好,黑人也好,妓女也好

2513
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,950
即便是个废话连篇喜欢进化论的无神论者也好

2514
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,500
振奋人心的演说,你看到瓦伦丁在哪了吗

2515
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,560
朋友们,虽然祂是个公正的神

2516
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:47,390
但祂也无力回天了...

2517
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:50,380
美国必将灭亡

2518
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:53,570
你确定我们这距离安全

2519
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:55,430
我们离他们1000英尺远,怎么了

2520
01:17:55,530 --> 01:17:57,020
万一计算错误怎么办

2521
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:58,520
你只需要相信我就是了

2522
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:02,270
犹太人,黑人,同性恋

2523
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:05,920
魔鬼将永生永世焚烧着他们

2524
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:07,210
不好意思

2525
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:11,710
你要去哪,嘿,你怎么回事啊

2526
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:14,730
我是个天主教男妓

2527
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:18,670
最近和一个黑人犹太教男友享受婚外性行为

2528
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:21,210
他在军方的堕胎诊所工作

2529
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:25,020
所以撒旦万岁,祝你周末愉快,夫人

2530
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:31,780
该死,他要走了,我现在就要开始测试了

2531
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:34,590
希望这帮怪胎都有我们的电话卡

2532
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:41,080
我叫你坐下

2533
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:44,320
像你这种异教徒就该滚出去

2534
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:48,430
就好像恶魔现在真会拯救你似的

2535
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:53,170
你会吃了自己的孩子,你会被主的鲜血溺死

2536
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:55,460
他不会拯救你的

2537
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:02,730
我操

2538
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:06,330
我看不下去了,你赶紧过来

2539
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,780
天啊,我操

2540
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:53,110
加拉哈德,听到我说话吗,哈利

2541
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:56,800
哈利,你到底怎么回事

2542
01:19:58,600 --> 01:19:59,800
把音量调小点声好吗

2543
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:04,700
- 没想到效果这么好  - 说的是什么样的结果

2544
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,400
百分之百

2545
01:20:07,390 --> 01:20:10,590
所以每个人都被影响了,不管他们有没有电话卡

2546
01:20:10,790 --> 01:20:13,290
而且附加好处是除掉了那个金士曼

2547
01:20:13,690 --> 01:20:15,340
还没有

2548
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:11,930
你真该看看这个

2549
01:23:08,810 --> 01:23:12,780
你对我做了什么,我完全控制不了自己

2550
01:23:14,010 --> 01:23:16,210
我杀光了所有人

2551
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,900
- 而且是我想这么做  - 这方法不赖吧

2552
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,330
简单来说,就是神经波刺激了攻击行为的核心区域

2553
01:23:24,330 --> 01:23:26,380
同时关闭了其抑制作用

2554
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:29,070
电波是通过你那肮脏的免费电话卡传播的

2555
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:29,990
我猜的没错吧

2556
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:34,910
你知道这样看起来像什么吗

2557
01:23:35,090 --> 01:23:38,480
像我俩都爱看的老电影里的场景

2558
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:40,780
现在我会告诉你我的全部计划

2559
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:44,780
然后我会想出一些稀奇复杂的方式来干掉你

2560
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,970
而你也会想出同样复杂的逃生办法

2561
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:50,270
这听起来不错

2562
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:53,070
可惜这不是在拍电影

2563
01:23:57,060 --> 01:23:59,060
不

2564
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:09,210
他死了吗

2565
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:11,750
你朝人头上来一枪通常就是这个结果

2566
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:13,280
感觉不错吧

2567
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:16,310
不,一点都不好,太他妈的难受啦

2568
01:24:16,650 --> 01:24:18,760
什么,你都杀了教堂里那么多人

2569
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,040
这不过是其中一个

2570
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:22,340
没有,他们是互相残杀的

2571
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:29,130
好吧,把倒计时设好,明天开始狂欢

2572
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,900
美国必将灭亡

2573
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,250
亚瑟

2574
01:25:07,290 --> 01:25:10,990
- 你看到了吗  - 看到了,很难过

2575
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:14,580
召集金士曼

2576
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:23,100
你看不出来我至今所做的一切都是为了补偿他吗

2577
01:25:43,450 --> 01:25:46,050
我看见了一个有潜力的年轻人

2578
01:25:46,050 --> 01:25:48,650
他可以完成使命而且想有所作为

2579
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:59,100
金士曼

2580
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:08,330
亚瑟,哈利死了

2581
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:10,880
加拉哈德死了

2582
01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:14,430
因此,我们刚为他举杯致敬

2583
01:26:14,530 --> 01:26:17,130
那你肯定知道那个变态的阴谋

2584
01:26:17,230 --> 01:26:19,820
这个世界有多少人有那张电话卡

2585
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,620
瓦伦丁可以发个信号给他们任何一个人,所有人

2586
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:24,520
如果他们同时回家,那么...

2587
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:27,960
的确,但多亏有了加拉哈德的录音资料

2588
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:29,630
我们有瓦伦丁的供述

2589
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:33,410
这份情报已经移交给相关部门了

2590
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:35,680
我们的工作完成了

2591
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:39,600
这亦是我们逝去的朋友的最崇高的遗赠了

2592
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,600
就这样

2593
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,300
过来坐下,小伙子

2594
01:26:47,190 --> 01:26:52,390
这是1815年拿破仑时期的白兰地

2595
01:26:53,290 --> 01:26:57,180
我们只在金士曼特工牺牲时才会喝

2596
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:00,050
加拉哈德非常喜欢你

2597
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:06,280
此时此景,我觉得稍微...

2598
01:27:07,270 --> 01:27:08,970
改下规矩也无妨

2599
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:12,140
他们都是金士曼

2600
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:13,970
没错,我们的创始成员

2601
01:27:15,670 --> 01:27:18,160
我想你也来一起举杯

2602
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:21,260
敬加拉哈德

2603
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:26,260
敬加拉哈德

2604
01:27:29,050 --> 01:27:31,480
哈利说你不喜欢经常破坏规矩

2605
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:33,160
现在又是为何

2606
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:35,260
你很棒,艾格西

2607
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:39,130
或许我会任命你顶替加拉哈德的位置

2608
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:44,340
如果我们在某些政治问题上能达成一致的话

2609
01:27:47,230 --> 01:27:51,260
你猜这是什么

2610
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:54,970
不必了,哈利给我展示过,你一点,我就死

2611
01:27:55,130 --> 01:27:57,320
我觉得这白兰地喝起来有点恶心

2612
01:27:58,710 --> 01:27:59,820
不错嘛

2613
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:03,320
瓦伦丁说服了你,某种意义上

2614
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:06,510
他一解释,我就明白了

2615
01:28:06,610 --> 01:28:09,110
当你感染上病毒,你就会发烧

2616
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:13,200
这是人体提高自己的体温来杀死病毒

2617
01:28:13,610 --> 01:28:18,100
地球也是这样的,温室效应就是发烧

2618
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:23,400
人类就是病毒,我们让我们的星球病了

2619
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:26,180
优胜劣汰是唯一的希望

2620
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:30,990
如果我们不减少人口,就只有两种后果

2621
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:35,590
宿主杀了病毒,或者,病毒杀了宿主

2622
01:28:36,090 --> 01:28:38,970
- 两者之一...  - 结果都一样

2623
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:41,780
病毒都会死

2624
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:45,920
于是瓦伦丁打算自己解决人口问题

2625
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:48,770
如果我们不采取措施,大自然也会

2626
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:52,870
有时优胜劣汰是确保物种生存的唯一办法

2627
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:56,410
历史将见证瓦伦丁作为救世主

2628
01:28:56,410 --> 01:28:58,760
是如何拯救人类免遭灭绝

2629
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:01,860
所以是由他来决定谁被淘汰,是吗

2630
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:04,030
他所有富有的合作伙伴都能生存下来

2631
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,260
然后他觉得谁有利用价值,他就会保他们平安

2632
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:11,050
- 不管他们是否认同他  - 而你,艾格西

2633
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:17,800
以哈利之名,我诚邀你成为新世界的一员

2634
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:22,940
你是时候该作出抉择了

2635
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:33,130
我宁愿随哈利而去,谢谢

2636
01:29:33,530 --> 01:29:34,730
如你所愿

2637
01:29:51,310 --> 01:29:56,410
我们这些普通人的通病是,眼疾手快

2638
01:29:57,400 --> 01:30:00,600
金士曼教了我不少东西,但手快这一项...

2639
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:02,800
没错,他们是我们的创始成员

2640
01:30:05,410 --> 01:30:07,290
我早就学会了

2641
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:14,330
你这个下贱的混蛋

2642
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:43,850
瓦伦丁节倒计时
至安全区或飞往北纬66°58'30 东经61°43'04.8

2643
01:30:48,950 --> 01:30:53,630
好了,兰斯洛特,把枪放下,已经确认过了

2644
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:57,600
亚瑟的手机刚刚收到一个新信息

2645
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:58,470
说是要去安全区

2646
01:30:58,470 --> 01:30:59,540
我们没有多少时间了

2647
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:02,400
- 你要怎么办  - 问题应该是我们要怎么办

2648
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:05,240
天知道瓦伦丁的名单里有谁

2649
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:07,650
我们别无选择

2650
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:10,830
我们得亲自去解决这事情

2651
01:31:14,170 --> 01:31:15,410
跟我来

2652
01:31:34,850 --> 01:31:38,500
- 这他们什么玩意  - 我也不知道

2653
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:39,930
你手里拿着的

2654
01:31:40,030 --> 01:31:42,790
是单人跨大气运载器

2655
01:31:42,890 --> 01:31:46,310
是里根的星球大战计划里衍生的产物

2656
01:31:46,310 --> 01:31:48,290
功能简单,但还是能用得上

2657
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:50,890
我们要把瓦伦丁的一颗卫星毁掉

2658
01:31:51,190 --> 01:31:53,690
打破卫星链,中止信号

2659
01:31:53,890 --> 01:31:55,890
这会让他花上好几小时个来重置

2660
01:31:56,090 --> 01:31:58,160
也给我们争取了足够的时间

2661
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:00,250
可以让我黑进瓦伦丁的主机里

2662
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:02,350
然后关闭系统

2663
01:32:02,690 --> 01:32:06,670
兰斯洛特,你要使用这玩意,去把你的光环服穿上

2664
01:32:15,850 --> 01:32:18,200
瑞典空军

2665
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:21,460
瑞典首相请求降落许可

2666
01:32:26,650 --> 01:32:28,540
允许降落

2667
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:34,250
- 给  - 谢谢

2668
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:38,410
- 多少人要来  - 不多,大部分人都自备燃料

2669
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:41,720
我估计我们从没这么紧张过

2670
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:43,940
欢迎您,首相先生

2671
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:48,930
看来植入物可以发射某种抗干扰信号

2672
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:52,420
保证佩戴者不受电话卡的信号波影响

2673
01:32:52,630 --> 01:32:53,680
就是这个信号波把所有人

2674
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:54,830
都变成了变态杀人狂

2675
01:32:54,930 --> 01:32:57,470
没错,但他们不知道的是

2676
01:32:57,670 --> 01:32:59,210
他可以控制植入物

2677
01:32:59,210 --> 01:33:01,590
达到超高温从而烧了他们的软组织

2678
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:05,990
瓦伦丁已经选了几个人选作为倒计时警告

2679
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:09,210
他得确保不会炸错人

2680
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:11,250
那现在这玩意能帮我们干嘛

2681
01:33:12,210 --> 01:33:14,910
它帮不了,洛克希,我们走

2682
01:33:27,590 --> 01:33:30,850
你飞得越高,气球膨胀得越厉害

2683
01:33:31,290 --> 01:33:34,790
当你飞到大气层边缘,气球就会爆炸

2684
01:33:35,490 --> 01:33:38,200
你必须在那之前将导弹发射出去,知道吗

2685
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:39,110
大气层边缘

2686
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:42,480
一旦你发射完导弹,你必须要解除装备快速降落

2687
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:44,720
祝你好运

2688
01:33:46,970 --> 01:33:48,560
你能做到的,好吗

2689
01:33:49,210 --> 01:33:52,000
艾格西,快过来,我们没时间了

2690
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:18,240
你要拿亚瑟的邀请函混进去

2691
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:22,060
- 我来假扮亚瑟吗  - 他的邀请函在他手机里

2692
01:34:22,190 --> 01:34:24,640
把这个交给他们,用他的真实姓名,切斯特·金

2693
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:27,330
- 那你呢  - 我是飞行员,我得留在这里

2694
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:31,830
- 我穿得了吗  - 这是为你量身定做的

2695
01:34:32,130 --> 01:34:35,630
感谢哈利吧,他给你定做的,穿上吧

2696
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:39,170
这些人都他妈怎么了

2697
01:34:39,170 --> 01:34:41,520
不知道,大概跟种族大屠杀有关吧

2698
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:43,700
给我话筒

2699
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:46,700
哈喽

2700
01:34:47,110 --> 01:34:48,610
都给我听好了

2701
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:52,510
你们这些人都他妈怎么回事

2702
01:34:52,710 --> 01:34:58,200
我想提醒各位,今天是值得庆祝的一天

2703
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:04,830
我们不要谈论死亡,而要关注诞生

2704
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:08,930
新时代的诞生

2705
01:35:09,290 --> 01:35:13,490
我们不必哀悼那些今天失去生命的人

2706
01:35:14,290 --> 01:35:16,690
我们要为他们的牺牲感到荣耀

2707
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:18,680
她有我的电话号码可以回电给我....

2708
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:22,480
因为他们扮演着拯救人类的角色

2709
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:29,310
我们不应该质疑和内疚

2710
01:35:29,370 --> 01:35:33,570
你们是被选中的人

2711
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:39,460
在给孩子们讲述的诺亚方舟故事里,诺亚是坏人吗

2712
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:42,660
上帝是坏人吗

2713
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:45,960
还有成双上方舟的动物们呢

2714
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:47,950
绝对不是

2715
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:53,550
没错,就是这样,让我们一起转换心情

2716
01:35:54,150 --> 01:35:59,860
尽情吃喝玩乐吧

2717
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:03,740
让我们相约在新时代

2718
01:36:28,710 --> 01:36:31,950
洛克希,是我,上面风景如何

2719
01:36:34,910 --> 01:36:37,300
- 难看死了  - 我这可是相当不错

2720
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:40,250
- 他们给你定做西装了吗  - 没,还没有

2721
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,410
那你要好好期待一下了

2722
01:36:42,410 --> 01:36:45,520
我们要去瓦伦丁的基地了,准备出发了

2723
01:36:46,990 --> 01:36:48,290
祝你好运

2724
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:57,480
这身打扮很不错,艾格西

2725
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:01,830
感觉也不错,梅林

2726
01:37:07,470 --> 01:37:11,510
我是N247驾驶员,查理·基洛,请求降落

2727
01:37:14,670 --> 01:37:16,170
允许降落

2728
01:37:21,110 --> 01:37:23,490
我操

2729
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:29,100
已侦测到敌方

2730
01:37:50,730 --> 01:37:52,130
艾格西,开始行动

2731
01:38:07,010 --> 01:38:08,210
切斯特·金

2732
01:38:08,910 --> 01:38:10,630
金先生,欢迎

2733
01:38:10,810 --> 01:38:14,090
我肯定您遵守了瓦伦丁先生的严格规定

2734
01:38:14,090 --> 01:38:15,180
没有携带武器

2735
01:38:15,310 --> 01:38:17,400
- 但是您不反对的话...  - 当然

2736
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:20,690
您有其他行李吗

2737
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:25,600
祝贺你,麦克罗夫,你从飞行员晋升为我的贴身男仆了

2738
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:29,190
- 你个混蛋  - 明白了吗,很好

2739
01:38:30,790 --> 01:38:32,040
谢谢

2740
01:38:58,060 --> 01:39:03,060
艾格西,找个手提电脑,连上网,时间紧迫

2741
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:06,260
记住要自然地混进去

2742
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:08,550
先生,您要点什么喝的吗

2743
01:39:09,050 --> 01:39:12,950
马汀尼,搭配杜松子酒,不要伏特加

2744
01:39:13,050 --> 01:39:18,040
搅拌十秒,再加少许没开瓶的味美思酒,谢谢

2745
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:25,140
- 梅林,开始记录了么  - 是的,集中注意力

2746
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:28,330
兰斯洛特,你做得很好,就快到了

2747
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:29,830
好的,梅林

2748
01:39:31,330 --> 01:39:33,530
艾格西,快点帮我连上网

2749
01:39:34,830 --> 01:39:36,030
好的,马上来

2750
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:39,930
兰斯洛特,你快接近海拔极限了

2751
01:39:39,930 --> 01:39:41,620
那些气球气球撑不了多久了

2752
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,020
准备发射导弹

2753
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:02,600
旧社会已死,新社会万岁

2754
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:05,300
非常赞同

2755
01:40:07,090 --> 01:40:08,540
我是莫顿·林德斯特

2756
01:40:08,540 --> 01:40:10,590
我是切斯特·金,你怎么连上网的,我不...

2757
01:40:10,690 --> 01:40:14,470
哦,这是个封闭式网络,你看,仅授权可用

2758
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:19,780
我已经锁定卫星

2759
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:22,840
你知道正确的时间吗,我想我的表还在之前的时区

2760
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:24,080
哦,好的,我看看

2761
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:36,300
选择模式

2762
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:38,030
系统分析中

2763
01:40:38,030 --> 01:40:40,660
- 艾格西,连上了,快滚回来飞机里  - 这就来

2764
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:44,260
兰斯洛特,祝你好运,发射倒数,三,二...

2765
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:52,650
别激动

2766
01:40:52,750 --> 01:40:54,280
你他妈的在这干嘛

2767
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:56,230
很明显,我的家族受邀前来了

2768
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:58,350
你他妈给我站起来,慢慢来

2769
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:02,860
该死,兰斯洛特,快点发射,另一个气球要爆了

2770
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:06,110
好的,梅林,我快好了,再给我点时间

2771
01:41:07,930 --> 01:41:10,910
瓦伦丁,我抓到了一个间谍

2772
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:12,930
V镜,放大

2773
01:41:13,870 --> 01:41:15,870
我操,是那个年轻男仆

2774
01:41:18,770 --> 01:41:20,240
狗娘养的

2775
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:21,510
好了

2776
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:33,500
哦,糟糕,拉响警报

2777
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:37,530
我不想有什么差池

2778
01:41:37,530 --> 01:41:41,010
好了,你发出两分钟警报,我开始重写系统

2779
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:43,890
开始倒计时

2780
01:41:50,700 --> 01:41:51,630
启动飞机升降器

2781
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:55,280
- 你看到他吗  - 在这儿

2782
01:42:04,170 --> 01:42:07,360
艾格西,左转,前方有两名警卫

2783
01:42:19,650 --> 01:42:21,350
兰斯洛特,解除装备,快

2784
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:34,840
艾格西,一直向前然后右转,那还有两个

2785
01:42:38,730 --> 01:42:42,130
好的,每个人站起来,V日倒计时

2786
01:42:42,230 --> 01:42:43,930
欢迎来到新的时代

2787
01:42:51,770 --> 01:42:52,970
螺旋形下降中

2788
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:11,370
艾格西,左转有个小的隧道

2789
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:21,300
我们开始吧

2790
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:22,020
十

2791
01:43:22,490 --> 01:43:23,290
九

2792
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:25,160
八

2793
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:27,200
七

2794
01:43:27,390 --> 01:43:29,390
六

2795
01:43:29,410 --> 01:43:30,510
五

2796
01:43:31,430 --> 01:43:33,280
四

2797
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:37,270
三、二、一

2798
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,400
生物识别成功

2799
01:43:42,350 --> 01:43:43,650
系统故障

2800
01:43:43,650 --> 01:43:46,000
很好,你们俩都做的很好

2801
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,360
这不行了

2802
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:49,460
本来可以的,他妈的怎么回事

2803
01:43:56,450 --> 01:43:58,150
干的漂亮,洛克希,好姑娘

2804
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:03,810
我们损失了一个卫星

2805
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:09,000
系统分析完成

2806
01:44:13,850 --> 01:44:17,800
不,不,我没有任何办法避开这个黑进系统

2807
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:16,550
已侦测到生物识别安全系统检测

2808
01:44:22,730 --> 01:44:26,230
怎么了,有什么问题吗

2809
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:30,320
拜托,不用拿枪吧,我只是个飞行员

2810
01:44:33,990 --> 01:44:35,990
操,梅林

2811
01:44:37,010 --> 01:44:38,510
快上来

2812
01:44:42,910 --> 01:44:44,050
快点

2813
01:44:47,820 --> 01:44:50,260
- 他妈的快点离开这吧  - 不行

2814
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:54,390
我进不去瓦伦丁的主机,它有生物识别安全系统

2815
01:44:55,060 --> 01:44:58,070
你得回去那地方,确保他的手不能碰到操作台

2816
01:44:58,450 --> 01:45:01,080
- 你他妈的在开玩笑吗  - 恐怕不是

2817
01:45:04,860 --> 01:45:06,560
那给我枪

2818
01:45:07,130 --> 01:45:10,680
这是我的,我给你看看你的吧

2819
01:45:28,630 --> 01:45:30,000
选得好

2820
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:34,040
重新形成卫星链要多久

2821
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:35,520
大概是一到两个小时

2822
01:45:35,620 --> 01:45:38,020
胡说,把这两个靠一起的连起来不就可以了

2823
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:39,370
但是那个不是你的

2824
01:45:44,650 --> 01:45:46,590
V镜,打给E

2825
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:51,270
E,我是V,听着兄弟,我最后关头出了点问题

2826
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:52,140
我需要帮助

2827
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:54,000
我的一个卫星损毁了

2828
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,100
它旁边刚好有一个你的卫星

2829
01:45:56,740 --> 01:46:00,430
你真懂我,要多久才能完成

2830
01:46:03,430 --> 01:46:04,600
走

2831
01:46:08,620 --> 01:46:10,620
马上就能连接上

2832
01:46:19,310 --> 01:46:21,510
瓦伦丁要用别人的卫星

2833
01:46:21,510 --> 01:46:24,310
用不了多久他就要重新连接上形成卫星链

2834
01:46:24,610 --> 01:46:26,110
已进行到20%了

2835
01:46:44,190 --> 01:46:47,380
艾格西,瓦伦丁给你准备了一份大礼,赶紧行动

2836
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,600
那个金士曼死了没

2837
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:23,950
还没有,不过也快了

2838
01:47:24,450 --> 01:47:25,690
很好

2839
01:47:39,070 --> 01:47:40,790
梅林,我死定了

2840
01:47:53,220 --> 01:47:54,390
我也一样

2841
01:47:54,210 --> 01:47:56,850
两边都有人围攻,我没有退路了

2842
01:47:57,010 --> 01:47:59,510
洛克希,帮我一个忙

2843
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:01,300
给我妈打个电话

2844
01:48:01,310 --> 01:48:04,510
告诉她把自己和迪恩还有宝宝分开锁好门

2845
01:48:06,010 --> 01:48:07,500
还有告诉她,我爱她

2846
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,490
我操,完蛋了

2847
01:48:21,790 --> 01:48:25,290
梅林,还记得你说的那些对我们毫无帮助的植入物吗

2848
01:48:26,540 --> 01:48:28,470
你能把它们全部激活吗

2849
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:34,980
好了,这下轮到我了,瓦伦丁

2850
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:45,870
噢,不好,他在搞什么鬼

2851
01:48:45,870 --> 01:48:47,860
我中止不了程序

2852
01:48:59,350 --> 01:49:00,500
是否激活安全植入物

2853
01:49:00,770 --> 01:49:02,210
是的,激活吧

2854
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:06,250
安全植入激活

2855
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:08,490
不要

2856
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,570
我的老天

2857
01:50:05,580 --> 01:50:07,460
真他妈壮观啊

2858
01:50:07,690 --> 01:50:10,030
梅林,你他妈的真是天才

2859
01:50:10,490 --> 01:50:13,820
他妈的外面出什么事了

2860
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:19,870
你不是那个失踪的公主吗

2861
01:50:19,870 --> 01:50:21,150
你能把我弄出去吗

2862
01:50:21,370 --> 01:50:23,390
要是能的话,你会给我一个吻吗

2863
01:50:23,390 --> 01:50:24,870
我一直梦想着能亲吻公主

2864
01:50:24,970 --> 01:50:26,960
要是你现在把我弄出去,我不单止会给你一个吻

2865
01:50:29,150 --> 01:50:30,460
你妈逼

2866
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:34,760
你真以为我会蠢得给自己植入个芯片吗

2867
01:50:35,060 --> 01:50:36,750
你他妈的是疯子吗

2868
01:50:37,750 --> 01:50:40,250
那些无辜的人是为什么自杀的

2869
01:50:40,950 --> 01:50:43,650
你屁都没能阻止

2870
01:50:45,350 --> 01:50:47,570
好的,我锁好了门,现在我要做什么

2871
01:50:47,570 --> 01:50:50,540
照我说的,把你的女儿放进卫生间,然后丢掉钥匙

2872
01:50:51,140 --> 01:50:53,290
还在继续呢

2873
01:50:53,490 --> 01:50:55,910
- 你他妈的疯了  - 照着做就好了

2874
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:24,880
艾格西,信号开始了

2875
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:27,700
快把瓦伦丁的手从那鬼桌子上挪开

2876
01:51:27,900 --> 01:51:30,400
对不起了,亲爱的,我得去拯救世界

2877
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:33,980
如果你拯救了世界,你要不要菊花来一炮

2878
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,620
我马上回来

2879
01:51:35,090 --> 01:51:36,210
祝你好运

2880
01:51:42,980 --> 01:51:44,100
伦敦

2881
01:52:12,210 --> 01:52:13,340
里约

2882
01:52:29,110 --> 01:52:30,240
趴下

2883
01:52:31,940 --> 01:52:33,130
你成功了

2884
01:52:42,530 --> 01:52:44,450
这个玻璃坚持不了多久

2885
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:47,740
你待在这里

2886
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:51,830
梅林,快点,我怎么上去

2887
01:52:51,830 --> 01:52:53,320
继续射击,我正在找路

2888
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:54,590
明白

2889
01:53:10,210 --> 01:53:11,080
我操

2890
01:53:29,930 --> 01:53:30,930
我们恢复了

2891
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:33,270
恢复了

2892
01:53:40,570 --> 01:53:42,070
太棒了

2893
01:53:50,410 --> 01:53:52,140
艾格西,把他那该死的手挪开

2894
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:54,530
狠狠地教训他,亲爱的

2895
01:54:00,750 --> 01:54:03,440
首尔,加拉加斯,孟买

2896
01:54:12,090 --> 01:54:14,430
他妈的杀啊,杀光你们的朋友吧

2897
01:54:31,850 --> 01:54:33,780
艾格西,世界要他妈完蛋了

2898
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:45,300
- 他死了没  - 还没

2899
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:48,100
别玩儿了,快杀了他

2900
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:10,920
葛希尔,葛希尔

2901
01:56:20,910 --> 01:56:22,910
快点

2902
01:56:25,410 --> 01:56:26,600
杀了他

2903
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:11,060
干的漂亮

2904
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:14,050
好样的,太棒了,艾格西

2905
01:57:14,550 --> 01:57:18,050
干的漂亮,艾格西,你也很棒,兰斯洛特

2906
01:57:20,450 --> 01:57:22,700
对不起,妈妈绝不会伤害你的

2907
01:57:23,690 --> 01:57:26,140
妈妈绝不会伤害你的,对不起

2908
01:57:29,310 --> 01:57:30,440
还好吗

2909
01:57:34,130 --> 01:57:36,130
哈利会为你骄傲的,艾格西

2910
01:57:37,330 --> 01:57:38,530
他是对的

2911
01:57:54,110 --> 01:57:55,900
怎么样啊,哥们

2912
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,710
这时候你要对我说什么电影名言了吗

2913
01:58:00,510 --> 01:58:02,410
跟你和哈利说的一样

2914
01:58:05,660 --> 01:58:07,860
可惜我们不是在拍电影,伙计

2915
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:10,700
很好

2916
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:35,470
艾格西,你去哪,不用拿香槟,飞机上有很多

2917
01:58:42,670 --> 01:58:45,860
- 你拯救世界了吗  - 没错,我拯救世界了

2918
01:58:48,650 --> 01:58:52,200
- 要进来吗  - 是的

2919
01:58:57,330 --> 01:58:59,630
梅林,门锁住了,怎么进去

2920
01:59:01,950 --> 01:59:03,530
26、25

2921
01:59:07,830 --> 01:59:10,590
梅林,你真棒

2922
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:14,830
艾格西,欠我人情啊

2923
01:59:20,450 --> 01:59:22,360
艾格西

2924
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:29,200
我的天哪

2925
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:31,900
后面还有,别走开!

2926
02:00:16,390 --> 02:00:19,280
米歇尔,关掉那个鬼东西,它搞到我很烦躁

2927
02:00:20,120 --> 02:00:21,960
我倒是喜欢这首歌

2928
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,910
开着吧,妈妈

2929
02:00:27,290 --> 02:00:29,310
小瘪三回来了

2930
02:00:29,620 --> 02:00:31,620
你终于要回来和谈了吗,小子

2931
02:00:32,270 --> 02:00:35,480
还是你又要逃跑,瞧你穿的这副人模狗样的

2932
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:37,580
你说西装吗

2933
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:40,170
不

2934
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:42,260
我认识的一个朋友带我去了

2935
02:00:42,260 --> 02:00:43,850
萨维尔路上的一家裁缝店

2936
02:00:44,210 --> 02:00:46,210
他给了我一份工作,妈妈

2937
02:00:46,990 --> 02:00:48,990
还有许多额外福利

2938
02:00:49,630 --> 02:00:51,630
包括一栋房子

2939
02:00:52,430 --> 02:00:54,420
过来和我一起住吧,妈妈

2940
02:00:55,050 --> 02:00:57,050
- 来吧  - 你给我坐下

2941
02:00:58,180 --> 02:01:01,430
你妈等一下就会到医院探望你了,听到了吗

2942
02:01:01,530 --> 02:01:04,980
别理他,艾格西,走吧,快点走

2943
02:01:06,140 --> 02:01:07,640
好吧

2944
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:09,470
对,乖乖听你妈的话

2945
02:01:09,570 --> 02:01:12,500
你别以为找个裁缝就以为这破衣服会适合你

2946
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:13,800
你个烂货

2947
02:01:16,690 --> 02:01:19,150
我的一个好朋友说过

2948
02:01:20,410 --> 02:01:21,750
不知礼

2949
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:24,520
无以

2950
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:28,960
立也

2951
02:01:29,310 --> 02:01:31,190
- 迪恩  - 你他妈闭嘴

2952
02:01:31,380 --> 02:01:33,720
艾格西,我他妈的来教你什么叫做礼仪...

2953
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:40,880
那么

2954
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:45,240
我们是要这样傻站一整天,还是要来痛快打一架

2955
02:01:53,500 --> 02:02:01,700
谨以此片纪念我的母亲凯茜
她总能在平凡中彰显不凡
是她教会了我如何做好一个金牌绅士
