1
00:01:15,452 --> 00:01:18,843
Zero, this is Zero One Alpha. We
have secured Falcon.

2
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:21,476
I say again, We have
secured Falcon.

3
00:01:22,952 --> 00:01:26,452
I will count from one to ten. 
Within that you'll tell me what I wanna know.

4
00:01:27,052 --> 00:01:28,752
Otherwise...

5
00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:32,052
the number ten is
the last thing you'll hear.

6
00:01:32,352 --> 00:01:33,352
One,

7
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,691
two,

8
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:35,291
three...

9
00:01:35,552 --> 00:01:36,712
four,

10
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,225
five,

11
00:01:38,293 --> 00:01:39,392
six,

12
00:01:39,403 --> 00:01:40,502
seven,

13
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:40,819
eight...

14
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:42,852
Grenade. Get Back.

15
00:01:42,876 --> 00:01:44,476
Allahu Akbar.

16
00:01:56,754 --> 00:01:58,754
Shit.

17
00:01:58,854 --> 00:02:00,854
Fucking missed it

18
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,954
How did I fucking miss it...

19
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:09,152
Merlin, I apologize for putting you
in this position.

20
00:02:09,352 --> 00:02:11,052
You trained him well.

21
00:02:11,952 --> 00:02:14,152
James,

22
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,025
your training is over.

23
00:02:18,452 --> 00:02:21,350
Welcome to Kingsman,

24
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,900
Lancelot.

25
00:02:22,903 --> 00:02:24,903
Sir

26
00:02:26,652 --> 00:02:29,152
I'll deal with this mess.

27
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
Personally.

28
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:35,396
London

29
00:02:35,952 --> 00:02:39,652
I very much regret that your husband's
bravery can't be publicly celebrated.

30
00:02:39,752 --> 00:02:40,707
I hope you understand.

31
00:02:40,736 --> 00:02:41,834
How can I understand?

32
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,875
You won't tell me anything!

33
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,798
I didn't even know he
wasn't with his squad.

34
00:02:47,987 --> 00:02:50,079
I'm so sorry, I can't say more.

35
00:02:50,952 --> 00:02:54,152
I would like to present you
with this medal of valor.

36
00:02:54,252 --> 00:02:57,552
If you look closely on the back,
there's a number.

37
00:02:57,652 --> 00:03:00,452
And as a more concrete gesture of our
gratitude,

38
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,649
we'd like to offer you a...

39
00:03:03,326 --> 00:03:05,126
Let's call it a favor.

40
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,490
The nature of it is your choice.

41
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:10,383
Just tell the operator: "Oxford's, not Brogue's".

42
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,195
 And then I'll know it's you.

43
00:03:13,252 --> 00:03:15,252
I don't want your help.

44
00:03:15,852 --> 00:03:18,352
I want my husband back.

45
00:03:26,246 --> 00:03:27,541
What's your name, young man?

46
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:28,965
Eggsy.

47
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,452
Hello, Eggsy.

48
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,460
Can I see that?

49
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,752
You take care of this, Eggsy.

50
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:43,596
All right?

51
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:49,752
And take care of your mom too.

52
00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:16,319
Kingsman

Argentina, 17 Years Later

54
00:04:30,452 --> 00:04:34,110
So sorry, Professor Arnold.
Just a tiny bit more.

55
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,799
Oh for god's sakes, just strip it off.

56
00:04:36,984 --> 00:04:40,590
I am under very strict instructions
not to hurt you.

57
00:04:40,744 --> 00:04:42,944
Look, you've made a mistake.

58
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:45,852
I am university lecturer.
I've got no money.

59
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,552
This isn't about money.

60
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,245
Our boss just wants to just talk to you.

61
00:04:49,852 --> 00:04:51,927
Am I meant to find that reassuring?

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,200
He'll be here soon. He'll explain.

63
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:56,852
Do you like whiskey?

64
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:59,873
Red, get a '62 Dalmore.

65
00:04:59,897 --> 00:05:01,351
Hhmm...

66
00:05:01,352 --> 00:05:04,474
Honestly, this whiskey is amazing.

67
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,735
You will shit.

68
00:05:25,956 --> 00:05:29,802
I suppose asking to borrow a cup of sugar
is a step too far?

69
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:54,452
Professor Arnold,

70
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:56,528
I'm here to take you home.

71
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,085
Hmm... 1962 Dalmore.

72
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:11,184
It would be a sin to spill any.

73
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:13,643
Don't you think?

74
00:06:53,952 --> 00:06:55,948
Can you hold these?

75
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Please.

76
00:07:09,936 --> 00:07:11,036
Thank you.

77
00:07:17,752 --> 00:07:19,594
Everything is clean.

78
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:28,052
My kind of welcome.

79
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:37,952
No stomach for violence.

80
00:07:37,966 --> 00:07:38,641
I mean, literally.

81
00:07:38,652 --> 00:07:41,252
I see one drop of blood, that is me..

82
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,205
...done.

83
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:43,652
I am like ...

84
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:44,673
...projectile.

85
00:07:44,952 --> 00:07:47,552
Listen, I'm so sorry...

86
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,025
you had to witness all this unpleasantness.

87
00:07:50,352 --> 00:07:52,752
Due to our uninvited guest.

88
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,095
But I promise you,

89
00:07:54,152 --> 00:07:57,152
By the time I find out who he works for...

90
00:07:57,152 --> 00:08:01,852
you and I will be the best of friends.

91
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:10,085
To the shop, please.

92
00:08:33,352 --> 00:08:35,352
Arthur is in the dining room, sir.

93
00:08:45,052 --> 00:08:46,352
Arthur.

94
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:47,485
Galahad.

95
00:08:47,852 --> 00:08:52,519
The others were beginning to wonder
if we were going to have a double toast.

96
00:08:55,152 --> 00:08:58,568
Gentlemen, I am thankful to say that
it's been 17 years...

97
00:08:58,668 --> 00:09:02,052
since we last had occasion
to use this decanter.

98
00:09:02,652 --> 00:09:06,952
Lancelot was an outstanding agent
and a true Kingsman.

99
00:09:07,052 --> 00:09:08,652
He will be sorely missed.

100
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,600
To Lancelot.

101
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:14,464
<b>To Lancelot</b>

102
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:22,252
I intend to start the selection process
for Lancelot's replacement tomorrow.

103
00:09:22,952 --> 00:09:25,938
I want each of you to propose a candidate

104
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,841
and have them report to UK HQ

105
00:09:27,904 --> 00:09:30,752
No later than 9 p.m. GMT.

106
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,860
Thank you.

107
00:09:34,352 --> 00:09:36,032
Merlin.

108
00:09:36,232 --> 00:09:37,232
Come in.

109
00:09:38,052 --> 00:09:40,779
Lancelot was investigating
a group of mercenaries

110
00:09:40,804 --> 00:09:43,476
who were experimenting
with biological weaponry.

111
00:09:43,553 --> 00:09:46,027
Glasses, gentlemen. Please.

112
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:51,352
Uganda, 2012. Synthetic Cathinone.

113
00:09:51,452 --> 00:09:54,352
You put it in the water supply of
a guerrilla army base.

114
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:58,452
Rage, cannibalism. Multiple fatalities.

115
00:09:59,652 --> 00:10:01,652
Chechnya, 2013.

116
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:03,319
Insurgents turned on one another.

117
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:07,152
Indisputable, the work of our mercenaries
but no trace of any chemicals of any kind.

118
00:10:07,252 --> 00:10:09,540
So what happened to Lancelot?

119
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,237
He tracked them to this property in Argentina.

120
00:10:12,552 --> 00:10:14,589
And while he had them
under surveillance,

121
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,852
he became aware that they had
effected a kidnapping.

122
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,591
So he executed a solo rescue mission... which failed.

123
00:10:21,383 --> 00:10:24,844
This is his last transmission:
<i><b>KIDNAP VICTIM IS PROFESSOR JAMES ARNOLD</b></i>

124
00:10:24,952 --> 00:10:27,685
- Who is he?
- Some climate change doomsayer.

125
00:10:27,786 --> 00:10:31,352
Expounded something called Gaia theory
about the world healing itself or some such.

126
00:10:31,452 --> 00:10:34,952
But what's curious,
is he's not actually missing.

127
00:10:35,652 --> 00:10:37,152
This is Professor Arnold.

128
00:10:38,052 --> 00:10:40,252
At Imperial College, this morning.

129
00:10:41,352 --> 00:10:45,552
It's all yours.
And don't forget your membership proposal.

130
00:10:45,752 --> 00:10:48,952
Try picking a more suitable candidate this time.

131
00:10:49,052 --> 00:10:50,412
17 years

132
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:54,155
and still evolving with the times remains
an entirely foreign concept to you.

133
00:10:54,713 --> 00:10:57,982
Need i remind you, I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for that young man.

134
00:10:58,052 --> 00:11:00,972
He was as much Kingsman material
as any of them.

135
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,090
More so.

136
00:11:02,152 --> 00:11:05,152
But he wasn't exactly one of us, was he?

137
00:11:05,852 --> 00:11:09,852
Let's face it, Galahad.
Your little experiment failed.

138
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:13,769
With respect, Arthur, you're a snob.

139
00:11:14,052 --> 00:11:16,463
With respect?

140
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,154
The world is changing.

141
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:22,308
There's a reason why aristocrats
developed weak chins.

142
00:11:41,198 --> 00:11:42,352
<b><i>Eggsy?</i></b>

143
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:46,533
<i>Eggsy, come here.</i>

144
00:11:49,452 --> 00:11:51,852
- Got any whistler, babe?
- No.

145
00:11:51,905 --> 00:11:54,221
Why don't you do your mamma a favor,
Go down to the shop and get some.

146
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:57,940
- Get 'em yourself.
- Oi, What i have said to you about speaking to Dean like that?

147
00:11:57,952 --> 00:12:01,311
Three's a crowd, isn't it
Why don't Dean's poodle go?

148
00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:02,862
I tell you what,

149
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:06,486
Why don't you take this and get the stuff
and get yourself some sweets?

150
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:10,931
And while you're gone, we'll show your mother
how three can be good a company.

151
00:12:13,491 --> 00:12:14,841
Thanks babe.

152
00:12:16,927 --> 00:12:17,971
Come here.

153
00:12:22,252 --> 00:12:23,853
Here we go.

154
00:12:25,367 --> 00:12:26,652
Is it better?

155
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:44,224
If Dean treat your mum's so bad, why doesn't she leave him?

156
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,209
Low self-esteem.

157
00:12:45,293 --> 00:12:46,417
That's her problem.

158
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,018
Fuck off, why would she have low self-esteem?

159
00:12:48,056 --> 00:12:49,580
Eggsy mum's a world fit.

160
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,502
- No offense pal.
- It's all right.

161
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,287
- One of these days I'm gonna smash his face in.
- Are you mental, cuz?

162
00:12:57,935 --> 00:13:00,535
He'll just get that lot to do you
and then pretend he knew nothing

163
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,425
...about it.

164
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:06,468
Oy, you think you can chat
shit about us and we wont do nothing,

165
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:08,876
just because our <i>governor</i> bangin' Eggsy's mum?

166
00:13:08,915 --> 00:13:10,830
Pretty much, yeah.

167
00:13:10,849 --> 00:13:13,846
Leave it, let's just go, man. It's not worth it.

168
00:13:13,852 --> 00:13:17,052
You boys have outstayed your welcome.

169
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,150
Leave.

170
00:13:19,923 --> 00:13:21,223
What?

171
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:23,404
I'm sorry about that <i>bruh</i>.

172
00:13:26,352 --> 00:13:27,918
Yeah... muck.

173
00:13:29,796 --> 00:13:32,235
They weren't fucking worth it, Boys.

174
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:36,861
It's freezing.
Why are we walking?

175
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,531
- You jacked his fucking car keys, <i>bruh</i>?
- Yeah, now we're gonna nick his car.

176
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:43,555
Fucking shit.

177
00:13:49,718 --> 00:13:51,147
Hold on boys.

178
00:13:53,862 --> 00:13:55,536
Hey, That's my fucking car.

179
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560
Oi, Oi, Eggsy.

180
00:13:57,926 --> 00:14:00,235
I swear,
you're in fucking trouble.

181
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:13,277
Floor it, Eggsy.

182
00:14:18,347 --> 00:14:19,995
Hey yeah Dean, look it's me.

183
00:14:20,096 --> 00:14:22,096
Eggsy just stole my fucking car.

184
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:26,582
I've come out of the pub, He's done 15 about donuts
on my fucking face and then he's drove off.

185
00:14:26,852 --> 00:14:31,872
No, I cant, He's disrespecting me
and so he's disrespecting you.

186
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,466
<i>Thickie.</i>

187
00:15:18,677 --> 00:15:21,852
Foxes are vermin, cuz.
You should've driven it over.

188
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:23,951
I should've done a lot of things.

189
00:15:24,051 --> 00:15:26,051
I'll sort this, get out of the car.

190
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,151
Get out of the fucking car.

191
00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:40,552
Eggsy, there is no such thing as honor among thieves.

192
00:15:41,552 --> 00:15:45,352
Now you can start giving me some
names of the boys you were with...

193
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:47,269
Or you go down.

194
00:15:48,035 --> 00:15:49,235
It's up to you.

195
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:53,385
I want to exercise my right to a phone call.

196
00:15:54,952 --> 00:15:57,952
Well, I hope it's to your mom...

197
00:15:58,452 --> 00:16:02,184
to tell her that you're gonna to be
18 months late for your dinner.

198
00:16:32,652 --> 00:16:35,577
<i>Customer complaints.
How may I help you?</i>

199
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:40,452
My name's Eggsy Unwin. Sorry, Gary Unwin.

200
00:16:41,152 --> 00:16:44,009
And I'm up shit creek, I'm in
an urban police station and

201
00:16:44,058 --> 00:16:45,699
my mom said to call this number
if ever I needed help...

202
00:16:45,776 --> 00:16:48,251
<i>I'm sorry, sir. Wrong number.</i>

203
00:16:48,352 --> 00:16:49,909
Wait, wait

204
00:16:51,195 --> 00:16:53,826
Oxford's not Brogue's?

205
00:16:55,352 --> 00:16:57,089
<i>Your complaint has been duly noted,</i>

206
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,888
<i> and we hope that we've not lost you
as a loyal customer.</i>

207
00:17:11,026 --> 00:17:12,154
Yeah...

208
00:17:13,952 --> 00:17:15,152
Shit, What?

209
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:22,152
Yes, I totally understand.

210
00:17:42,277 --> 00:17:43,477
Eggsy

211
00:17:43,552 --> 00:17:45,663
Would you like a lift home?

212
00:17:46,343 --> 00:17:47,118
Who are you?

213
00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:49,052
The man who got you released.

214
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:50,118
That ain't an answer.

215
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:52,652
A little gratitude would be nice.

216
00:17:53,652 --> 00:17:55,496
My name is Harry Hart.

217
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,745
And I gave you that medal.

218
00:17:58,652 --> 00:18:00,852
Your father saved my life.

219
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:06,552
So before you was a tailor, were
you in the army?

220
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,275
Like an officer?

221
00:18:08,537 --> 00:18:09,737
Not quite.

222
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,825
So where was you posted, Iraq or something?

223
00:18:11,852 --> 00:18:14,052
Sorry, Eggsy. Classified.

224
00:18:14,952 --> 00:18:16,952
But my dad saved your life, yeah?

225
00:18:17,752 --> 00:18:19,852
The day your father died,

226
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:21,473
I missed something.

227
00:18:22,252 --> 00:18:24,209
And if it weren't for
his courage, my mistake

228
00:18:24,234 --> 00:18:26,276
would have cost the lives
of every man present.

229
00:18:27,552 --> 00:18:29,309
So I owe him.

230
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:33,652
Your father was a brave man.

231
00:18:33,795 --> 00:18:34,795
A good man.

232
00:18:35,452 --> 00:18:38,952
And having read your files, I'd think he'd
be bitterly disappointed in the choices you've made.

233
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:40,573
You can't talk to me like that.

234
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,867
Huge IQ, great performance in primary school.

235
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:45,588
And it all went tits up.

236
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,800
Drugs, petty crime, never had a job.

237
00:18:48,999 --> 00:18:50,277
Do you think there's a lot of jobs going around here?

238
00:18:50,752 --> 00:18:52,928
Doesn't explain why you
gave up your hobbies.

239
00:18:52,953 --> 00:18:55,080
First prize, regional
under tens' gymnastics

240
00:18:55,156 --> 00:18:58,752
Two years in a row. Your coach had you
pegged as Olympic team material.

241
00:18:58,852 --> 00:19:00,434
Yeah and when you grow up
around someone like my

242
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:01,976
step-dad, you pick up new
hobbies pretty quick.

243
00:19:02,052 --> 00:19:04,752
Ah of course, always someone else's fault.

244
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:07,374
And who's to blame you for
quitting the Marines?

245
00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:10,076
You were halfway through training,
doing brilliantly, but you gave up.

246
00:19:10,152 --> 00:19:12,052
Because my mum went mental.

247
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:14,700
Banging on about losing me as well as my dad.

248
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:17,678
Then we wouldn't be cannon
fodder for snobs like

249
00:19:17,703 --> 00:19:20,276
you, judging people like
me from your ivory towers.

250
00:19:20,352 --> 00:19:23,179
With no thought about why we do what we do.

251
00:19:23,477 --> 00:19:26,106
We ain't got much choice, you get me?

252
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:28,714
And if we was born with the same
silver spoon up our arses...

253
00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:30,836
we would do just as well as you,

254
00:19:31,043 --> 00:19:32,336
if not better.

255
00:19:32,454 --> 00:19:34,454
What the fuck you doing here?
You taking a piss?

256
00:19:36,152 --> 00:19:39,252
Some more examples of young men who
simply need a silver suppository?

257
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:41,351
Ya, they are exceptions. Come on.

258
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:42,688
Nonsense, we haven't finished our drinks.

259
00:19:42,752 --> 00:19:44,763
After you nicked his
car, Dean says you're a

260
00:19:44,788 --> 00:19:46,976
fair guy I don't give a
shit what your mum says.

261
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:48,752
Listen, boys.

262
00:19:49,885 --> 00:19:53,791
I've had a rather emotional day,
so whatever your beef with Eggsy is,

263
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,243
and I'm sure it's well founded...

264
00:19:56,652 --> 00:19:59,874
I would appreciate it enormously
if you could just leave us in peace...

265
00:19:59,974 --> 00:20:02,864
until I finish this lovely pint of Guinness.

266
00:20:06,152 --> 00:20:08,852
You should get out of the way, Granddaddy.
Or you'll get hurt a lot.

267
00:20:08,952 --> 00:20:10,952
He ain't joking, you should go.

268
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:18,275
Excuse me.

269
00:20:20,043 --> 00:20:23,243
If you're looking for another rent boy,
they're on the corner of Smith's Street.

270
00:20:28,752 --> 00:20:30,063
Manners...

271
00:20:31,252 --> 00:20:32,511
maketh...

272
00:20:35,452 --> 00:20:36,730
man.

273
00:20:44,352 --> 00:20:46,367
Do you know what that means?

274
00:20:47,952 --> 00:20:49,952
Then let me teach you a lesson.

275
00:20:58,952 --> 00:21:02,652
Are we going to stand around here all day,
or are we going to fight?

276
00:21:47,387 --> 00:21:49,427
You fucking... You fucking...

277
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:53,862
"STUN"

278
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:05,035
Amnesia

279
00:22:31,075 --> 00:22:32,494
Sorry about that.

280
00:22:33,028 --> 00:22:35,103
Needed to let off a little steam.

281
00:22:35,152 --> 00:22:38,202
Heard, yesterday a friend of mine died.

282
00:22:39,052 --> 00:22:41,252
He knew your father too, actually.

283
00:22:43,452 --> 00:22:47,952
I do apologise, Eggsy. I should not
have done this in front of you.

284
00:22:48,052 --> 00:22:50,539
No. Please.. I won't say nothing,
I swear.

285
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,366
If there is one thing I can
do, it's keep my mouth shut.

286
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:54,819
- You won't tell a soul?
- I swear, I've never crossed anyone out.

287
00:22:54,852 --> 00:22:56,852
Is that a promise?
- On my life.

288
00:23:00,952 --> 00:23:02,952
Much appreciated, Eggsy.

289
00:23:03,052 --> 00:23:05,252
You're right about the snobs.

290
00:23:05,438 --> 00:23:07,913
But there too, there are exceptions.

291
00:23:08,052 --> 00:23:09,752
Best of luck with everything.

292

298
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,732
- Please don't hurt him.
- Fuck off!

299
00:23:49,748 --> 00:23:51,133
Shut the fuck up.

300

- I want to know the name of the geezer you was with.
- I was not with anyone.

322
00:25:09,553 --> 00:25:10,553
You wanker!

323
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
I'll have you soon.

324
00:25:37,752 --> 00:25:39,952
I've never met a tailor before.

325
00:25:40,602 --> 00:25:42,560
But I know you ain't one.

326
00:25:45,885 --> 00:25:47,482
Come with me.

327
00:25:56,324 --> 00:25:58,324
Come on here.

328
00:26:03,277 --> 00:26:04,514
What do you see?

329
00:26:04,614 --> 00:26:07,667
Someone who wants to know
what the fuck is going on.

330
00:26:09,423 --> 00:26:11,552
I see a young man with potential.

331
00:26:12,952 --> 00:26:14,652
A young man who is loyal.

332
00:26:15,852 --> 00:26:18,049
Who can do as he is asked,

333
00:26:18,225 --> 00:26:20,203
and who wants to do something good with his life.

334
00:26:22,052 --> 00:26:24,052
Did you see the film "Trading Places"?

335
00:26:24,076 --> 00:26:26,076
No

336
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:29,452
How about "Nikita"?

337
00:26:29,611 --> 00:26:31,611
"Pretty Woman"?

338
00:26:31,635 --> 00:26:32,802
All right.

339
00:26:32,803 --> 00:26:35,350
My point is, the lack of a
silver spoon has set you

340
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:37,676
on a certain path, but
you needn't stay on it.

341
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:42,929
If you're prepare to adapt and learn,
you can transform.

342
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:45,552
Oh, like in "My Fair Lady"?

343
00:26:46,452 --> 00:26:49,352
I know you're full of surprises.

344
00:26:49,377 --> 00:26:51,252
Yes, like "My Fair Lady"

345
00:26:52,452 --> 00:26:55,952
Only in this case, I am offering you the
opportunity to become a Kingsman.

346
00:26:56,552 --> 00:26:57,852
A tailor?

347
00:26:57,981 --> 00:27:00,356
A Kingsman agent.

348
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:03,852
- Like a spy?
- Of sorts.

349
00:27:06,104 --> 00:27:07,304
Interested?

350
00:27:07,401 --> 00:27:09,890
You think I've got anything to lose?

351
00:27:16,852 --> 00:27:22,452
Since 1849, Kingsman Tailors have clothed
the world's most powerful individuals.

352
00:27:22,552 --> 00:27:26,952
In 1919, a great number of them had lost
their heirs to World War 1.

353
00:27:28,052 --> 00:27:31,052
That meant a lot of money going un-inherited.

354
00:27:31,552 --> 00:27:35,652
And a lot of powerful men with a desire
to preserve peace and protect life.

355
00:27:35,752 --> 00:27:38,202
Our founders realized
that they could channel

356
00:27:38,227 --> 00:27:40,676
that wealth and influence
for a greater good.

357
00:27:40,752 --> 00:27:44,652
And so began our adventure.

358
00:27:44,752 --> 00:27:47,810
An independent international
intelligence agency

359
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:50,705
operating at the highest
level of discretion.

360
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:53,229
Without the politics and bureaucracy...

361
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:57,250
that undermine the integrity of
government run spy organizations.

362
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,774
A suit is the modern gentleman's armor.

363
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:04,152
And the Kingsman agents
are the new knights.

364
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:08,052
- How deep does this fucking thing go?
- Deep enough.

365
00:28:52,552 --> 00:28:54,252
Shit. We're late.

366
00:29:18,952 --> 00:29:21,652
Your father had the same look on his face.

367
00:29:23,252 --> 00:29:24,508
As did I.

368
00:29:26,252 --> 00:29:27,489
Come on.

369
00:29:30,052 --> 00:29:32,352
- Galahad.
- My code name.

370
00:29:32,452 --> 00:29:34,752
Late again, sir.

371
00:29:34,878 --> 00:29:35,878
Good Luck.

372
00:29:36,052 --> 00:29:37,591
In you go.

373
00:29:48,752 --> 00:29:50,170
Fall in.

374
00:29:52,547 --> 00:29:55,347
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Merlin.

375
00:29:55,552 --> 00:29:57,978
You are about to embark
on what is probably the

376
00:29:58,003 --> 00:30:00,176
most dangerous job
interview in the world.

377
00:30:00,252 --> 00:30:05,252
One of you and only one of you
will become the next Lancelot.

378
00:30:05,952 --> 00:30:09,452
Can anybody tell me what this is?

379
00:30:10,652 --> 00:30:12,965
- A body bag, sir.
- Correct.

380
00:30:13,352 --> 00:30:15,952
- Charlie, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

381
00:30:16,052 --> 00:30:18,651
In a moment, you will
each collect a body bag.

382
00:30:18,676 --> 00:30:20,776
You will write your
name on that bag.

383
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:24,152
You will write the details of your
next of kin. On that bag.

384
00:30:24,252 --> 00:30:26,002
This represents your
acknowledgment of

385
00:30:26,027 --> 00:30:27,776
the risks that you
are about to face...

386
00:30:27,852 --> 00:30:29,938
as well as your
agreement to strict

387
00:30:29,963 --> 00:30:32,976
confidentiality, which
incidentally if you break...

388
00:30:33,052 --> 00:30:38,752
will result in you and your next
of kin being in that bag.

389
00:30:40,452 --> 00:30:41,952
Is that understood?

390
00:30:43,352 --> 00:30:44,852
Excellent.

391
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:46,376
Fall out.

392
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:55,083
Roxanne. But..

393
00:30:55,108 --> 00:30:56,776
...call me Roxy.

394
00:30:56,852 --> 00:30:58,291
- I am Eggsy.
- Eggy?

395
00:30:58,316 --> 00:30:59,376
No, Eggsy

396
00:31:00,852 --> 00:31:02,356
Eggy... and where did
they dig you up?

397
00:31:02,381 --> 00:31:04,676
You know we are not allowed
to discuss who proposed us.

398
00:31:04,752 --> 00:31:06,182
No need to bite his head off.

399
00:31:06,207 --> 00:31:08,476
Charlie's only making
conversation, right Charlie?

400
00:31:09,052 --> 00:31:10,552
I'm Digby.

401
00:31:10,553 --> 00:31:12,227
Digby.

402
00:31:12,252 --> 00:31:13,525
Eggy, this is

403
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,168
Rufus.

404
00:31:14,193 --> 00:31:15,532
Rufus, Eggy.

405
00:31:17,758 --> 00:31:20,678
So Eggy, are you
Oxford or Cambridge?

406
00:31:20,703 --> 00:31:21,703
Neither.

407
00:31:21,752 --> 00:31:22,980
St. Andrews? Durham?

408
00:31:23,005 --> 00:31:25,276
Oh wait, I think we may have met.

409
00:31:25,353 --> 00:31:28,975
Did you serve me at the McDonalds
 in Winchester Service Station?

410
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:30,215
No.

411
00:31:30,434 --> 00:31:32,954
But if I had, I give you an extra helping of secret sauce.

412
00:31:33,105 --> 00:31:34,899
It's definitely St. Andrews.

413
00:31:36,651 --> 00:31:38,851
- Just ignore them.
- Do you need a pen?

414
00:31:38,952 --> 00:31:39,577
Cheers.

415
00:31:39,602 --> 00:31:41,476
- Amelia, isn't it?

416
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
- Amelia, 
- Eggsy

417
00:31:43,524 --> 00:31:44,751
Hi Eggsy!

418
00:31:44,752 --> 00:31:46,808
Don't take any notice
of those guys.

419
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:48,276
That's what I told him.

420
00:31:49,452 --> 00:31:52,052
It's just scare tactics.

421
00:31:52,152 --> 00:31:53,864
Classic army technique.

422
00:31:53,889 --> 00:31:55,376
No one's gonna die.

423
00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:00,291
Shame.

424
00:32:02,352 --> 00:32:05,378
Great, so you don't know,
the CIA don't know.

425
00:32:05,403 --> 00:32:07,376
Nobody knows who this guy is?

426
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:08,727
Fine.

427
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:10,776
Seriously, it's fine.

428
00:32:10,852 --> 00:32:12,796
Well, it's not really fine but

429
00:32:12,821 --> 00:32:14,376
it's not why I'm here.

430
00:32:14,852 --> 00:32:16,448
Hell man, you know me?

431
00:32:16,473 --> 00:32:18,141
Money's not my issue.

432
00:32:18,247 --> 00:32:20,694
I could have retired straight
out of MIT, fucked off

433
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:22,935
to some island and let
the business run itself.

434
00:32:23,052 --> 00:32:26,202
Nobody told me to try
and save the planet.

435
00:32:26,227 --> 00:32:27,276
I wanted to.

436
00:32:27,552 --> 00:32:31,452
Climate change research, lobbying,
years of studying, billions of dollars.

437
00:32:31,552 --> 00:32:33,685
And you know why i quit?

438
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:38,563
Because the last time I checked,
the planet was still fucked.

439
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:41,328
Hence, my epiphany.

440
00:32:41,586 --> 00:32:44,352
Money won't solve this.

441
00:32:44,552 --> 00:32:46,797
Those idiots who call
themselves politicians,

442
00:32:46,822 --> 00:32:48,676
they bury their heads
in the sand...

443
00:32:48,752 --> 00:32:51,407
and stood for nothing but re-election.

444
00:32:52,052 --> 00:32:56,252
So I spent the last two years trying
to find a real solution.

445
00:32:56,728 --> 00:32:58,769
And I found it.

446
00:32:59,938 --> 00:33:03,143
Now, If you really want to make
the world a better place...

447
00:33:03,243 --> 00:33:05,480
I suggest you open
your fucking ears

448
00:33:05,505 --> 00:33:07,741
because I'm about
to tell it to you.

449
00:33:08,136 --> 00:33:09,864
Go on, Mr. Valentine.

450
00:33:09,889 --> 00:33:11,699
I'm still listening.

451
00:33:12,353 --> 00:33:15,953
As long as you agree to all my terms.

452
00:34:04,852 --> 00:34:07,852
No one panic. Listen to me. Stay calm.

453
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:14,151
- Use snorkels.
- Use snorkels?

454
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:17,204
- Shower heads.
- Shower heads?

455
00:34:17,304 --> 00:34:19,304
She's right. Go. Fucking go.

456
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:22,673
And what about pulling the fucking door?

457
00:35:46,852 --> 00:35:47,778
Congratulations

458
00:35:47,803 --> 00:35:49,776
on completing your first task.

459
00:35:49,852 --> 00:35:52,352
Charlie, Roxy, well done.

460
00:35:52,452 --> 00:35:54,652
For those who 're still confused

461
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,899
If you get a breathing
tube run the U-bend of

462
00:35:56,924 --> 00:35:58,976
a toilet, you have an
unlimited air supply.

463
00:35:59,052 --> 00:36:01,452
Simple physics. Worth remembering.

464
00:36:01,552 --> 00:36:02,383
Eggsy,

465
00:36:02,408 --> 00:36:04,900
Well done for spotting
that was a two-way mirror.

466
00:36:04,952 --> 00:36:06,244
He is probably seen enough of 'em.

467
00:36:06,269 --> 00:36:09,176
Yeah you can all wipe those
smirks off your faces.

468
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,679
Because as far as
I am concerned,

469
00:36:10,704 --> 00:36:12,237
every single one
of you has failed.

470
00:36:13,652 --> 00:36:16,652
You all forgot the most important thing:

471
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:18,752
Teamwork.

472
00:36:33,052 --> 00:36:35,957
So much for classic army technique.

473
00:36:38,652 --> 00:36:39,965
35,

474
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,177
5.

475
00:36:42,752 --> 00:36:44,952
That's it.

476
00:36:49,947 --> 00:36:50,947
Hello?

477
00:36:51,152 --> 00:36:52,402
Can I help you?

478
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:56,176
Yes, I have a question
about anthropogenic force.

479
00:36:57,452 --> 00:37:00,292
Really? Well, it's actually quite fascinating.

480
00:37:02,152 --> 00:37:03,847
My colleague died
trying to rescue you.

481
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,820
And I'm sure you saw how
well-trained he was.

482
00:37:05,931 --> 00:37:08,752
So I suggest you tell me who kidnapped you
and why they let you go.

483
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,873
I have no idea what you're talking about...

484
00:37:10,973 --> 00:37:13,257
I can not say, it was...

485
00:37:13,752 --> 00:37:16,752
Oh for god's sake, I barely touched you.
How man are...

486
00:37:35,952 --> 00:37:37,433
<font color="#ff0000">"IMPLANT ACTIVATED"

487
00:37:37,434 --> 00:37:40,434
Fuck that guy, whoever he is, I'm gonna...

488
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,509
He made me kill
Professor Arnold.

489
00:37:43,534 --> 00:37:45,368
Goddamn loved Professor Arnold.

490
00:37:45,452 --> 00:37:46,264
Well the good news is

491
00:37:46,289 --> 00:37:48,376
we know the emergency and
surveillance systems work.

492
00:37:48,451 --> 00:37:50,492
You know what is not good news?

493
00:37:50,592 --> 00:37:52,166
"My colleague died."

494
00:37:52,191 --> 00:37:53,922
That's what he said.

495
00:37:54,043 --> 00:37:56,449
This is an organization
and they are all over us.

496
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,628
Whoever you spoke to...

497
00:37:57,714 --> 00:38:02,352
I told you, I am in contact with the
KGB, MI6, Mossad and Beijing.

498
00:38:02,452 --> 00:38:04,552
They all insist he
wasn't one of theirs.

499
00:38:04,577 --> 00:38:05,577
Beijing.

500
00:38:05,852 --> 00:38:10,052
So freaky how there's no recognizable name
for the Chinese Secret Service.

501
00:38:10,552 --> 00:38:13,052
Now that's what you call a secret, right?

502
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,590
You know what?

503
00:38:14,617 --> 00:38:19,051
Fuck it. We need to speed things up.
Bring the product release forward.

504
00:38:19,152 --> 00:38:22,752
They are only halfway into production.
Speeding it will cost a fortune.

505
00:38:22,852 --> 00:38:25,950
Do I look like I give a fuck?
Just get it done..

506
00:38:27,652 --> 00:38:31,612
As some of you will have learned last night:

507
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:35,652
Teamwork is paramount here at Kingsman.

508
00:38:35,752 --> 00:38:39,158
We are here to enhance your skills,
test you to limits.

509
00:38:39,952 --> 00:38:43,152
Which is why you're gonna pick a puppy.

510
00:38:43,652 --> 00:38:45,448
Wherever you go, your dog goes.

511
00:38:45,473 --> 00:38:47,905
You will care for it,
you will teach it.

512
00:38:47,982 --> 00:38:51,052
And by the time they are fully trained,
so will you be.

513
00:38:51,152 --> 00:38:53,752
Those of you who are still here, that is.

514
00:38:53,852 --> 00:38:55,699
Do you understand?

515
00:38:55,724 --> 00:38:57,776
Choose your puppy.

516
00:39:00,552 --> 00:39:01,552
A poodle?

517
00:39:01,577 --> 00:39:02,384
What?

518
00:39:02,409 --> 00:39:04,600
They are gun dogs.

519
00:39:04,652 --> 00:39:06,519
Oldest working breed.

520
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:07,876
Easy to train.

521
00:39:09,252 --> 00:39:10,890
A pug?

522
00:39:11,852 --> 00:39:13,945
It's a bulldog, isn't it?

523
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:17,973
It would get bigger though, wouldn't it?

524
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:23,151
Ssshhhit

525
00:39:25,352 --> 00:39:28,352
His MRI shows no signs of concussion.

526
00:39:28,752 --> 00:39:31,752
No direct brain trauma at all.

527
00:39:32,052 --> 00:39:33,661
How much longer can he be out?

528
00:39:33,686 --> 00:39:35,776
That's the million-dollar question.

529
00:39:35,852 --> 00:39:37,988
We don't know what he was
exposed to in there.

530
00:39:38,013 --> 00:39:39,376
What about Harry's footage?

531
00:39:39,452 --> 00:39:41,201
It didn't stream to
his home terminal?

532
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,299
Encrypted and uncrackable.

533
00:39:44,352 --> 00:39:46,512
If and when he comes round,
you might wanna have

534
00:39:46,537 --> 00:39:48,476
a word with him about
sharing his password.

535
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,052
Is he gonna be alright?

536
00:39:51,252 --> 00:39:53,699
We need to have patience, Eggsy.

537
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,176
But there is hope. Okay?

538
00:39:55,252 --> 00:39:57,675
If I were you, I'd concentrate
on your training.

539
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,776
Make it through the
test, make him proud.

540
00:40:06,652 --> 00:40:10,352
Come on, J. B. Come on.

541
00:40:13,752 --> 00:40:16,038
I am not coming last cause of you.

542
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:19,355
J. B, I'll shoot you, goddamn.
I'll fucking shoot you.

543
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:22,252
Merlin said we're not allowed to hold you.

544
00:40:24,184 --> 00:40:25,456
Bollocks.

545
00:41:08,169 --> 00:41:09,830
Water.

546
00:41:12,361 --> 00:41:13,508
Come on then.

547
00:41:13,609 --> 00:41:14,356
Eggsy, you forget it.

548
00:41:14,381 --> 00:41:16,021
Oh what's wrong mate,
can't take a joke?

549
00:41:16,023 --> 00:41:17,977
Seriously, you'll get turned out and it's
just not worth it.

550
00:41:18,077 --> 00:41:20,023
Maybe I don't give a fuck
about getting kicked out.

551
00:41:20,048 --> 00:41:21,248
Really? Come on, you player.

552
00:41:21,283 --> 00:41:23,283
Charlie, fuck off.

553
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:26,973
Yeah, go on, walk away.

554
00:41:26,998 --> 00:41:27,998
Dickhead.

555
00:41:29,252 --> 00:41:30,512
Come on, J. B.

556
00:41:30,537 --> 00:41:31,976
It's all right.

557
00:41:45,352 --> 00:41:48,039
You have exactly one hour
to complete the test.

558
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,078
Starting now.

559
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:55,252
<i>- New target. 800 meters.
- It's unbelievable. You're still here.</i>

560
00:41:55,352 --> 00:41:58,665
Lingering on like some big steaming shit
that just won't flush.

561
00:41:58,835 --> 00:41:59,861
Roger that.

562
00:41:59,886 --> 00:42:02,963
Target identified. And how
about you shut the fuck up.

563
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:04,079
Positive discrimination.

564
00:42:04,268 --> 00:42:05,327
It's worth it.

565
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:08,295
Like those fucking steak
cooks who go down seaways

566
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,587
because their mum's a
one-legged lesbian.

567
00:42:10,663 --> 00:42:12,530
You don't know fuck-all about my grades.

568
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:14,788
Oh forgive me. I'm sure
you're highly educated.

569
00:42:14,813 --> 00:42:15,813
Fire when ready.

570
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,452
How's that for positive discrimination?

571
00:42:32,352 --> 00:42:34,352
I wanna thank you both for listening.

572
00:42:34,452 --> 00:42:37,739
And I really, really appreciate
your traveling all this way,

573
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:38,876
Your Royal Highness.

574
00:42:38,952 --> 00:42:41,008
And you too, Prime Minister.

575
00:42:41,033 --> 00:42:43,676
I think this is quite brilliant.

576
00:42:44,152 --> 00:42:46,852
It is absolutely brilliant.

577
00:42:47,452 --> 00:42:51,152
You are completely crazy.

578
00:43:02,052 --> 00:43:04,447
I'm sorry, Your Royal Highness...

579
00:43:04,596 --> 00:43:06,397
but you got a big role to play...

580
00:43:06,498 --> 00:43:08,752
in getting the Scandinavian region back on track.

581
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:10,596
You're popular,
inspirational and

582
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,876
you have the power to
galvanize the people.

583
00:43:13,452 --> 00:43:15,852
Now whether you're on board or not...

584
00:43:15,952 --> 00:43:17,702
I am going to have to insist

585
00:43:17,727 --> 00:43:20,976
on getting you somewhere I
can ensure your safety.

586
00:43:21,052 --> 00:43:23,185
How about you, Prime Minister?

587
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:24,276
You in or out?

588
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,352
Well, I think it's
about time that

589
00:43:26,377 --> 00:43:28,376
a politician did
something that...

590
00:43:28,952 --> 00:43:31,450
actually made a difference.

591
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:32,677
Too true.

592
00:43:33,852 --> 00:43:35,452
Take her away.

593
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:40,019
Drink?

594
00:43:40,044 --> 00:43:42,176
Why not?

595
00:43:44,552 --> 00:43:46,552
Wait, help me.

596
00:43:46,652 --> 00:43:49,352
Do not worry. No harm will come to the princess.

597
00:43:49,452 --> 00:43:53,952
Well I'm Republican anyway,
so it really doesn't matter.

598
00:43:55,152 --> 00:43:56,352
Release the princess.

599
00:44:29,852 --> 00:44:31,131
Okay, you're done.

600
00:44:31,156 --> 00:44:32,576
Not too bad, right?

601
00:44:33,252 --> 00:44:35,130
I hardly felt a thing.

602
00:44:35,155 --> 00:44:36,776
Welcome aboard.

603
00:44:37,252 --> 00:44:39,380
The pleasure is all mine.

604
00:44:45,452 --> 00:44:47,058
Ever heard of knocking?

605
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:49,876
Only when I'm casing
a place to rob.

606
00:44:50,552 --> 00:44:52,252
Amelia said you wanted to see me.

607
00:44:52,852 --> 00:44:55,252
Hope J. B.'s training is going
as well as yours is.

608
00:44:55,352 --> 00:44:56,486
Sit.

609
00:44:58,352 --> 00:45:01,752
Congratulations on making it
to the final six candidates.

610
00:45:01,852 --> 00:45:04,552
Your test results are even
better than I could've hoped.

611
00:45:06,952 --> 00:45:08,139
Come in.

612
00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:15,028
Eggsy, I need to have a
private conversation.

613
00:45:15,053 --> 00:45:16,093
You're dismissed.

614
00:45:16,344 --> 00:45:20,619
Nonsense, let him observe.
He'd learn a thing or two.

615
00:45:20,752 --> 00:45:23,252
As you wish. Take a look at this.

616
00:45:26,103 --> 00:45:30,103
Fucking hell. That's his... harry.

617
00:45:30,952 --> 00:45:32,299
You blew up his head?

618
00:45:32,324 --> 00:45:33,976
Its a bit much, isn't it?

619
00:45:34,052 --> 00:45:37,752
Actually, the explosion was caused
by an implant in his neck.

620
00:45:37,852 --> 00:45:39,049
Here. Under that scar.

621
00:45:39,074 --> 00:45:42,176
Did my hardware pick up the
signal that triggered it?

622
00:45:42,252 --> 00:45:44,152
Fortunately, yes.

623
00:45:44,252 --> 00:45:45,670
Unfortunately, the IP address

624
00:45:45,695 --> 00:45:48,676
it traced it to is registered
to the Valentine Corporation.

625
00:45:48,752 --> 00:45:51,652
It's not much of a lead.
They have millions of employees worldwide.

626
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:54,352
No, Richmond Valentine is a genius.

627
00:45:57,330 --> 00:46:00,003
Did you not see his announcement today?

628
00:46:00,452 --> 00:46:01,569
No.

629
00:46:05,652 --> 00:46:07,552
<i>We each spend on average</i>

630
00:46:07,577 --> 00:46:11,376
<i>$2,000 a year on cellphone
and internet usage.</i>

631
00:46:11,452 --> 00:46:15,255
It gives me great
pleasure to announce,

632
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,276
those days are over.

633
00:46:17,352 --> 00:46:22,552
As of tomorrow, every man, woman and child
can claim a free SIM card...

634
00:46:22,652 --> 00:46:26,952
compatible with any cellphone, any computer and...

635
00:46:27,052 --> 00:46:31,152
<i>utilize my communications network
for free.</i>

636
00:46:31,252 --> 00:46:35,752
<i>Free calls. Free internet. For everyone.</i>

637
00:46:36,952 --> 00:46:38,184
<i>Forever.</i>

638
00:46:54,002 --> 00:46:56,693
Valentine's assistant has the same implant scar.

639
00:46:57,066 --> 00:47:00,152
I think Mr. Valentine and I shall have a tête-à-tête.

640
00:47:03,352 --> 00:47:05,952
He's having a gala dinner next week.

641
00:47:06,052 --> 00:47:07,333
I'll get you an invitation.

642
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:08,876
You need to be careful though.

643
00:47:08,952 --> 00:47:11,112
Since you were out, hundreds of VIPs
have gone missing.

644
00:47:11,212 --> 00:47:13,679
No ransom notes,
exactly like Professor Arnold.

645
00:47:13,952 --> 00:47:16,014
Then I suggest you make my alias

646
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:17,843
somebody worth kidnapping.

647
00:47:31,752 --> 00:47:33,261
You don’t like heights?

648
00:47:33,286 --> 00:47:35,276
Yes it's okay I've done it before.

649
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,852
Probably alright if I don't think of it.

650
00:47:39,852 --> 00:47:42,852
Hey, you'll be alright,
You're top of the class.

651
00:47:44,652 --> 00:47:48,752
<i>Listen up, your mission is to land in the target
without the radar detecting you.</i>

652
00:47:48,852 --> 00:47:52,866
If I read you on the radar or
you miss the target, you go home.

653
00:47:53,052 --> 00:47:54,552
Is that understood?

654
00:47:57,652 --> 00:48:00,152
<i>Drop zone coming up. 20 seconds.</i>

655
00:48:01,552 --> 00:48:02,752
Here we go.

656
00:48:12,152 --> 00:48:15,362
- I really don't think I can do this.
- Of course you can't.

657
00:48:15,504 --> 00:48:17,352
Get to the back and I'll show you how, yeah.

658
00:48:25,143 --> 00:48:27,343
Eggsy, Eggsy.. wait. Hang on.

659
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,821
Roxy, just stop fucking about.

660
00:48:31,352 --> 00:48:32,852
Follow me, yeah?

661
00:48:49,452 --> 00:48:51,652
<i>Roxy, it's now or never.</i>

662
00:48:52,752 --> 00:48:53,900
Jump.

663
00:49:12,352 --> 00:49:15,432
Good girl, Rox.
I'm glad you made it.

664
00:49:34,252 --> 00:49:35,888
My my, you're all very cheerful.

665
00:49:35,913 --> 00:49:38,776
You really think it was gonna
be that straightforward?

666
00:49:38,852 --> 00:49:41,252
Any idiot can read a heads-up display.

667
00:49:41,352 --> 00:49:43,102
A Kingsman agent
needs to be able

668
00:49:43,127 --> 00:49:44,876
to solve problems
under pressure.

669
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:49,652
Like what to do when one of your group
has no parachute.

670
00:49:50,452 --> 00:49:53,452
No parachute? Who?

671
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,322
Fuck. Which one?

672
00:49:55,347 --> 00:49:57,103
What do we do?

673
00:49:57,226 --> 00:50:00,452
I told you. Aim for the target
coming under the radar.

674
00:50:00,552 --> 00:50:03,095
And I hope not to be
scraping one of you up.

675
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,057
But if I do have to and
you're inside the target...

676
00:50:06,194 --> 00:50:08,250
means I'll be very impressed.

677
00:50:13,852 --> 00:50:15,852
<i>Everybody listen, I've got a plan.</i>

678
00:50:17,059 --> 00:50:20,138
<i>Pair up. Grab the closest person to you.</i>

679
00:50:22,752 --> 00:50:24,252
<i>Rufus, come on.</i>

680
00:50:24,253 --> 00:50:25,275
Oh fuck.

681
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:26,976
<i>Rufus!</i>

682
00:50:27,084 --> 00:50:28,400
<i>Oh shit! I can't</i>

683
00:50:32,608 --> 00:50:33,608
<i>Fuck!!!</i>

684
00:50:34,718 --> 00:50:35,452
<i>Fucking cock.</i>

685
00:50:35,688 --> 00:50:37,520
<i>Rufus, you wanker.</i>

686
00:50:38,947 --> 00:50:40,645
<i>We are an odd number now.</i>

687
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:44,471
<i>- Quick, make a circle.
- Fuck. Right boys. Let's do it.</i>

688
00:50:49,099 --> 00:50:51,099
<i>We'll pull our cords one by one.</i>

689
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,362
<i>When we know who's it, the person
on the right grabs him.</i>

690
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:57,386
<i>Ok, Eggsy</i>

691
00:50:57,552 --> 00:51:00,752
Good plan, Eggsy. You have 30 seconds.
Come on now. Hurry up.

692
00:51:01,152 --> 00:51:02,752
<i>You first.</i>

693
00:51:02,776 --> 00:51:04,776
<i>Fuck</i>

694
00:51:08,352 --> 00:51:09,880
<i>OK, Me next.</i>

695
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:15,639
<i>See you on the ground, boys.</i>

696
00:51:18,352 --> 00:51:19,532
<i>Now me.</i>

697
00:51:28,539 --> 00:51:31,448
<i>Roxy, no matter what happens now,
I've got you. Alright?</i>

698
00:51:35,945 --> 00:51:36,545
<i>OK, Eggsy</i>

699
00:51:36,657 --> 00:51:37,578
<i>You first, okay?</i>

700
00:51:37,603 --> 00:51:38,603
<i>Yep</i>

701
00:51:50,513 --> 00:51:52,408
Shit.

702
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:00,924
Oh Shit.

703
00:52:06,521 --> 00:52:07,521
<i>Rox</i>

704
00:52:27,652 --> 00:52:29,527
Hugo, Digby,

705
00:52:29,527 --> 00:52:32,876
You don't land in the K
then you're not in the K.

706
00:52:33,052 --> 00:52:34,852
Rufus, you opened too soon.

707
00:52:34,877 --> 00:52:36,876
You were all over the radar.

708
00:52:36,952 --> 00:52:38,952
All three of you, pack your bags. Go home.

709
00:52:40,852 --> 00:52:42,989
Eggsy, Roxy, congratulations.

710
00:52:43,014 --> 00:52:45,076
You have set a new record.

711
00:52:45,252 --> 00:52:47,668
Opening at 300 feet,
that's pretty ballsy.

712
00:52:47,693 --> 00:52:50,276
Well done on completing another task.
Follow.

713
00:52:51,444 --> 00:52:54,444
Sorry sir, but why the fuck you choose me as the gimp?

714
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:57,966
- Am I the expendable candidate?
- No no no. You don't talk to me like that.

715
00:52:58,552 --> 00:53:01,702
If you have a complaint, you came here
and you whisper in my ear.

716
00:53:07,652 --> 00:53:10,319
You need to take that jape off your shoulder.

717
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:44,552
Mr. DeVere. It's a pleasure to meet you.

718
00:53:44,652 --> 00:53:47,286
I am sorry. I seem to have my dates muddles up.

719
00:53:47,386 --> 00:53:50,352
Oh no no. I canceled the gala because of you.

720
00:53:50,752 --> 00:53:53,002
Anybody willing to
donate that much

721
00:53:53,027 --> 00:53:55,276
deserves their own dinner.
Come in.

722
00:53:56,407 --> 00:53:57,533
Thank you.

723
00:53:59,252 --> 00:54:01,923
Gotta admit, I was really intrigued to meet you.

724
00:54:02,052 --> 00:54:04,086
There are not many
billionaires I do not know.

725
00:54:04,111 --> 00:54:04,976
I don't doubt it.

726
00:54:05,052 --> 00:54:08,017
Obviously, I have had my people
looking into your affairs

727
00:54:08,042 --> 00:54:10,393
and that's some pretty
old money you're from.

728
00:54:10,469 --> 00:54:11,907
How'd your folks make it?

729
00:54:11,932 --> 00:54:14,576
Property, mostly.
Property in the markets.

730
00:54:14,852 --> 00:54:17,352
Nothing personal, if that's your concern.

731
00:54:17,552 --> 00:54:21,152
No, I'm just in to find out what kind of person you are.
I'm sure you understand that.

732
00:54:21,252 --> 00:54:22,182
I most certainly do.

733
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,276
Hope you're hungry.

734
00:54:23,352 --> 00:54:24,466
I'm famished.

735
00:54:24,491 --> 00:54:26,376
Good. Grab a seat.

736
00:54:48,052 --> 00:54:49,628
I'll have the Big Mac, please.

737
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:50,576
Great choice.

738
00:54:50,652 --> 00:54:54,052
But nothing beats two cheeseburgers
with secret sauce.

739
00:54:54,153 --> 00:54:56,216
Tastes great with
this '45 Lafite.

740
00:54:56,241 --> 00:54:57,478
A classic pairing.

741
00:54:57,552 --> 00:55:01,352
May I suggest Twinkies with
1937 Château d'Yquem for pudding?

742
00:55:01,452 --> 00:55:03,105
I like it

743
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:06,952
So you want to donate to my foundation?

744
00:55:07,352 --> 00:55:10,552
You are aware that I wind
things down in that area, right?

745
00:55:10,912 --> 00:55:13,912
Climate changes affect us all,
Mr. Valentine.

746
00:55:14,052 --> 00:55:17,052
And you are one of the few powerful people
who seems to share my concerns.

747
00:55:17,152 --> 00:55:20,126
I stepped things down because I wasn't getting anywhere.

748
00:55:20,227 --> 00:55:22,952
Every bit of research kept pointing to the same thing.

749
00:55:23,052 --> 00:55:25,652
The carbon emissions are a red
herring, and we are past the

750
00:55:25,677 --> 00:55:28,276
point of no return no matter
what remedial actions we take.

751
00:55:28,421 --> 00:55:30,088
You know your shit.

752
00:55:30,278 --> 00:55:34,297
I sometimes envy the blissful
ignorance of those less well-versed

753
00:55:34,322 --> 00:55:35,661
in their shit.

754
00:55:36,852 --> 00:55:38,852
As Professor Arnold always said:

755
00:55:38,952 --> 00:55:41,896
"Humankind is the only virus
cursed to live with the

756
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:44,976
horrifying knowledge of its
host's fragile mortality."

757
00:55:46,052 --> 00:55:48,546
There are not a lot of people who know about him.

758
00:55:51,252 --> 00:55:53,952
Do you like spy movies, Mr. DeVere?

759
00:55:57,352 --> 00:56:00,052
Nowadays, they're all a little
serious for my taste.

760
00:56:00,652 --> 00:56:03,352
But the old ones... marvelous.

761
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:06,285
Give me a farfetched
theatrical plot any day.

762
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:08,676
The old Bond movies. Oh, man.

763
00:56:09,752 --> 00:56:13,452
Ah, When I was a kid, that was my dream job.

764
00:56:14,052 --> 00:56:15,952
A gentleman spy.

765
00:56:16,052 --> 00:56:19,648
I always felt the old Bond films were
only as good as the villain.

766
00:56:19,923 --> 00:56:23,923
As a child, I rather fancied
a futuristic colorful megalomaniac.

767
00:56:25,752 --> 00:56:29,013
What a shame we both had to grow up.

768
00:56:33,648 --> 00:56:34,952
Bon appétit.

769
00:56:37,452 --> 00:56:40,552
Just give me a couple of days
to think over your proposal.

770
00:56:40,652 --> 00:56:44,052
I'll have my people get in touch with yours
and it's all good.

771
00:56:44,152 --> 00:56:47,652
Thank you for such a "Happy Meal".

772
00:56:52,852 --> 00:56:55,252
- Well, you want me to follow him?
- Nah.

773
00:56:55,852 --> 00:56:58,052
I put a nano tracker gel in the wine.

774
00:56:58,552 --> 00:57:03,752
We'll know his every move for the next 24 hours.
Finally find out who he works for.

775
00:57:05,952 --> 00:57:08,160
Valentine didn't let
me out of his sight.

776
00:57:08,185 --> 00:57:10,024
All I got was this,
on the way in.

777
00:57:14,752 --> 00:57:18,252
South Glade Mission Church
is a hate group based in Kentucky.

778
00:57:18,552 --> 00:57:20,436
The FBI have been
monitoring them for years.

779
00:57:20,461 --> 00:57:22,176
Do you think Valentine
is a supporter?

780
00:57:22,252 --> 00:57:25,605
No evidence yet of a direct connection,
but I'll keep looking.

781
00:57:26,452 --> 00:57:27,377
Oh, by the way,

782
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:30,176
the ever-growing list
of missing persons...

783
00:57:30,252 --> 00:57:33,285
Now includes Scandinavian Royalty.

784
00:57:33,452 --> 00:57:36,152
Royal Crown Princess Tilde.

785
00:57:38,252 --> 00:57:41,152
Just let me out, you PSYCHO!

786
00:57:41,252 --> 00:57:44,252
I told you, you're free to go anytime you want.

787
00:57:44,352 --> 00:57:47,277
As long as you agree
to my conditions.

788
00:57:47,302 --> 00:57:48,576
I don't agree.

789
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,644
And I am never ever going to agree!

790
00:57:51,745 --> 00:57:53,151
Enough yet.

791
00:57:53,252 --> 00:57:54,814
Bitch.

792
00:57:58,952 --> 00:58:03,152
<i>The list of missing celebrities and dignitaries
has continued to grow in recent weeks.</i>

793
00:58:03,252 --> 00:58:07,252
<i>And world leaders are coming under increasing
pressure to provide answers.</i>

794
00:58:07,352 --> 00:58:10,552
We are doing everything in our
power to find princess Tilde.

795
00:58:11,352 --> 00:58:15,552
You know, governments and security forces
worldwide are working together...

796
00:58:15,652 --> 00:58:18,325
to find the person behind these abductions.

797
00:58:18,552 --> 00:58:21,644
<i>In other news, people all
over the world continue to</i>

798
00:58:21,669 --> 00:58:24,876
<i>wait in line day and night
to get their free SIM card.</i>

799
00:58:24,952 --> 00:58:27,652
Mrs. P. You get one?

800
00:58:27,752 --> 00:58:30,352
Yeah, I've been queuing up all day.

801
00:58:30,452 --> 00:58:34,852
<i>This unprecedented giveaway
by the philanthropist Richmond Valentine...</i>

802
00:58:34,952 --> 00:58:37,952
<i>has already seen over a billion cards distributed.</i>

803
00:58:38,052 --> 00:58:39,552
At ease.

804
00:58:41,152 --> 00:58:43,692
So you thought you were done for the day, huh?

805
00:58:44,352 --> 00:58:45,852
Probably not.

806
00:58:47,352 --> 00:58:49,852
- A party?
- Tonight. In London.

807
00:58:50,952 --> 00:58:52,652
- Who is this?
- Your target.

808
00:58:52,752 --> 00:58:55,427
Your mission is to use your
NLP Training to win over

809
00:58:55,452 --> 00:58:58,076
the individual in the
photograph in your envelope.

810
00:58:58,152 --> 00:59:01,652
And when I say "win over", I do mean in the Biblical sense.

811
00:59:01,752 --> 00:59:02,981
Easy

812
00:59:03,752 --> 00:59:05,577
Most girls love a bit rough.

813
00:59:05,602 --> 00:59:07,621
We'll see about that, yeah.

814
00:59:07,952 --> 00:59:09,652
Who is that anyway?

815
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:19,552
I just had to come over and say "Amazing eyes".

816
00:59:19,652 --> 00:59:22,152
- You wearing color contacts?
- No.

817
00:59:22,452 --> 00:59:25,652
- You so are
- Oh my god. 'Negging'. That's hilarious.

818
00:59:25,752 --> 00:59:28,152
I haven't had anyone try
that since the 90s.

819
00:59:28,177 --> 00:59:29,177
Excuse me?

820
00:59:29,352 --> 00:59:31,958
"Negging". Saying something
negative to a pretty

821
00:59:31,983 --> 00:59:34,376
girl in order to undermine
her social value.

822
00:59:34,552 --> 00:59:37,272
Its supposed to make you
want to win his approval.

823
00:59:37,297 --> 00:59:40,176
Absurdly basic neurolinguistic
programming technique.

824
00:59:40,252 --> 00:59:42,435
Is it just me or does this
champagne taste a little bit funny?

825
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:43,740
That's an acquired
taste, mate.

826
00:59:43,753 --> 00:59:46,352
- I think it's just cheap.
- Get one of these instead. They're delicious.

827
00:59:46,453 --> 00:59:49,556
You know, if you're interested in ornamental
techniques, this guy is textbook.

828
00:59:49,657 --> 00:59:51,721
See what he just did? Its
called an 'opinion opener.

829
00:59:51,746 --> 00:59:53,576
He got you talking with
a neutral question...

830
00:59:53,652 --> 00:59:57,852
got all of us involved in the conversation,
so that you crave individual attention.

831
00:59:57,952 --> 01:00:00,339
Nah, I'm just saying that the
champagne tastes weird...

832
01:00:00,364 --> 01:00:03,176
Lady Sophie, Montague Herring,
phone call for you at reception.

833
01:00:03,252 --> 01:00:06,252
- Be right back.
- See you in a bit, yeah.

834
01:00:06,652 --> 01:00:10,187
- Good job, Rox. I'm feeling a bit rough.
- You alright?

835
01:00:10,288 --> 01:00:11,584
Sorry to eavesdrop...

836
01:00:11,687 --> 01:00:15,147
but there is a much easier way to
guarantee getting someone home.

837
01:00:15,352 --> 01:00:17,052
Rohypnol.

838
01:00:18,952 --> 01:00:21,152
Or even something stronger.

839
01:00:38,491 --> 01:00:40,248
Who the fuck are you?

840
01:00:41,352 --> 01:00:42,852
Where am I?

841
01:00:44,752 --> 01:00:48,072
This knife can save your life.

842
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,400
Fuck

843
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,392
My employer's got two questions for you, Eggsy.

844
01:00:56,652 --> 01:01:00,700
What the fuck is Kingsman?
And who is Harry Hart?

845
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,442
I do not know what the fuck that is.

846
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:05,220
Oh Eggsy, I just killed
two of your friends

847
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:07,310
because they gave me the
same bullshit answer.

848
01:01:09,518 --> 01:01:12,004
Just cut the fucking ropes, please.

849
01:01:12,312 --> 01:01:14,445
Eggsy, is the Kingsman worth dying for?

850
01:01:16,866 --> 01:01:18,866
Fuck You

851
01:01:32,552 --> 01:01:33,823
Congratulations.

852
01:01:33,848 --> 01:01:35,276
Bloody well done.

853
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:40,944
- How'd the others do?
- Roxy passed with flying colors.

854
01:01:41,452 --> 01:01:42,925
Charlie's up next.

855
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:44,176
Want to watch?

856
01:01:45,252 --> 01:01:46,752
Yeah, alright.

857
01:01:49,052 --> 01:01:51,252
Is Kingsman really worth dying for?

858
01:01:51,352 --> 01:01:54,712
No fuck, it isn't shit
I'll tell all you want, please.

859
01:01:54,952 --> 01:01:56,331
Chester King's Arthur,

860
01:01:56,356 --> 01:01:59,176
head of a spy agency;
It's called Kingsman.

861
01:01:59,252 --> 01:02:02,252
Thank you Charlie. Much appreciated.

862
01:02:02,276 --> 01:02:04,276
Come on, It wasn't the fucking deal

863
01:02:13,952 --> 01:02:16,124
I had such high hopes for you.

864
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,176
You are a bloody disgrace.

865
01:02:18,552 --> 01:02:19,752
I'm so sorry

866
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:21,576
Please untie me.

867
01:02:21,852 --> 01:02:23,352
Untie yourself.

868
01:02:24,852 --> 01:02:27,552
Arthur, please.

869
01:02:31,398 --> 01:02:33,398
Anyone?...No

870
01:02:33,752 --> 01:02:36,452
Galahad, Percival. Congratulations.

871
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:39,351
You candidates have reached the
final stage of the testing process.

872
01:02:39,452 --> 01:02:43,247
As tradition allows, you now have
24 hours to spend with them.

873
01:02:43,852 --> 01:02:45,074
Eggsy, you should know

874
01:02:45,099 --> 01:02:46,876
your father reached this point.

875
01:02:47,452 --> 01:02:48,452
From now on,

876
01:02:48,457 --> 01:02:50,976
there are no safety nets.
Understood?

877
01:02:54,452 --> 01:02:55,952
Good. Dismissed.

878
01:02:59,452 --> 01:03:02,152
Charlie, time to go home.

879
01:03:02,176 --> 01:03:03,782
Fuck you

880
01:03:03,783 --> 01:03:05,728
My fucking dad's gonna hear about this.

881
01:03:08,252 --> 01:03:10,252
"To pee or not to pee?"

882
01:03:10,352 --> 01:03:14,902
That was the headline the day after I
diffused a dirty bomb in Paris.

883
01:03:15,452 --> 01:03:18,269
- "Germany 1 - England 5."
- I missed that game.

884
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:21,412
I was breaking up an undercover spy ring at Pentagon.

885
01:03:26,553 --> 01:03:27,727
My first mission.

886
01:03:27,752 --> 01:03:31,202
I foiled the assassination
of Margaret Thatcher.

887
01:03:31,278 --> 01:03:33,251
Not everybody had thanked you for that one.

888
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:36,471
The point is, Eggsy, nobody thanked
me for any of them.

889
01:03:36,752 --> 01:03:40,303
Front page news, and all these occasions
were celebrity nonsense.

890
01:03:40,552 --> 01:03:44,268
Because it is the nature of Kingsman that
our achievements remain secret.

891
01:03:44,452 --> 01:03:47,752
A gentleman's name should appear in the
newspaper only three times:

892
01:03:47,852 --> 01:03:50,352
When he's born, when he marries and when he dies.

893
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:53,852
And we are, first and foremost, gentlemen.

894
01:03:53,952 --> 01:03:55,168
Pretty fucked then.

895
01:03:55,269 --> 01:03:58,800
Its like Charlie said,
I am just a pleb.

896
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:02,612
Being a gentleman has nothing to do with
the circumstances of one's birth.

897
01:04:02,752 --> 01:04:04,752
Being a gentleman is something one learns.

898
01:04:04,906 --> 01:04:06,906
Yeah, but how?

899
01:04:07,557 --> 01:04:08,813
Alright, first lesson,

900
01:04:08,838 --> 01:04:11,692
you should have asked me
before you took a seat.

901
01:04:13,161 --> 01:04:14,295
Second lesson,

902
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,725
how to make a proper martini.

903
01:04:16,745 --> 01:04:19,149
Yes, Harry.

904
01:04:22,547 --> 01:04:25,675
Goddamn it. It fucking hurts.

905
01:04:25,853 --> 01:04:28,301
You are the one who asked for
a biometric security system.

906
01:04:28,326 --> 01:04:29,777
What's wrong with
a simple switch?

907
01:04:29,852 --> 01:04:31,227
A simple switch?

908
01:04:31,252 --> 01:04:34,776
This is an extremely
dangerous machine.

909
01:04:34,852 --> 01:04:39,352
It should only be operated by someone
responsible and sane as me.

910
01:04:39,552 --> 01:04:42,540
Bad shit can happen
if it falls into the wrong hands.

911
01:04:43,052 --> 01:04:44,852
SYNC MAIN TERMINAL

912
01:04:45,152 --> 01:04:48,483
- Are we done here? Shit
- No, now this one,

913
01:04:48,508 --> 01:04:50,676
for the test of the church.

914
01:04:50,752 --> 01:04:54,752
This one just has a short range.
A simple switch will do.

915
01:05:00,452 --> 01:05:03,330
So you gonna teach me how to talk proper
like in 'My Fair Lady'?

916
01:05:03,452 --> 01:05:04,477
That'd be absurd.

917
01:05:04,502 --> 01:05:07,576
Being a gentleman has nothing
to do with one's accent.

918
01:05:07,752 --> 01:05:10,252
Its about being at ease in one's own skin.

919
01:05:10,352 --> 01:05:14,683
As Hemingway said:"There is nothing noble
in being superior to your fellow man."

920
01:05:14,852 --> 01:05:18,848
"True nobility is being superior
to your former self."

921
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:25,433
Now, the first thing every gentleman
needs is a good suit.

922
01:05:25,552 --> 01:05:28,852
By which I mean a bespoke suit.
Never off the peg.

923
01:05:28,952 --> 01:05:31,348
And Kingsman suits are
always bulletproof,

924
01:05:31,373 --> 01:05:32,876
So let's get you measured.

925
01:05:32,952 --> 01:05:35,775
And whether you get the job
or not, you will have a

926
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,676
lasting and useful memento
of your time at Kingsman.

927
01:05:38,952 --> 01:05:42,652
I'm so sorry, sir, but a gentleman
is completing his fitting.

928
01:05:42,952 --> 01:05:44,734
Fitting Room 2 is available.

929
01:05:44,759 --> 01:05:47,176
One does not use
Fitting Room 2...

930
01:05:47,252 --> 01:05:49,802
when one is popping one's cherry.

931
01:05:50,252 --> 01:05:53,752
Perhaps I'll show you Fitting Room 3, while we wait.

932
01:06:03,352 --> 01:06:05,852
- So we going up or down?
- Neither.

933
01:06:07,252 --> 01:06:11,452
- Is this it?
- Of course not. Pull the hook on your left.

934
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:19,912
Oh, Yes

935
01:06:19,952 --> 01:06:22,452
Very very nice.

936
01:06:25,352 --> 01:06:27,852
You're going to need a pair of shoes
to go with your suit.

937
01:06:27,952 --> 01:06:32,052
An Oxford is any formal shoe,
with open lacing.

938
01:06:32,152 --> 01:06:35,352
This additional decorative piece is called broguing.

939
01:06:35,452 --> 01:06:38,811
- "Oxford's, not brogue's."
- Words to live by, Eggsy.

940
01:06:38,836 --> 01:06:39,976
Words to live by.

941
01:06:40,452 --> 01:06:41,652
Try a pair.

942
01:06:41,881 --> 01:06:44,000
Your weapon scores are excellent, by the way.

943
01:06:44,752 --> 01:06:46,299
These you're familiar with.

944
01:06:46,488 --> 01:06:48,352
And this is our standard issue pistol.

945
01:06:48,452 --> 01:06:50,913
Its quite unique. As you all
see it, it also fires a

946
01:06:50,938 --> 01:06:53,676
shotgun cartridge for use in
messy close-range situations.

947
01:06:53,752 --> 01:06:56,587
How do they feel? Now do your
very best in impersonation

948
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:58,776
of a German aristocrat's
formal greeting.

949
01:07:02,152 --> 01:07:03,352
No, Eggsy.

950
01:07:07,152 --> 01:07:08,652
That is sick.

951
01:07:09,552 --> 01:07:11,566
In the old days, they had a phone in the heel as well.

952
01:07:11,693 --> 01:07:12,862
How do I get it back in?

953
01:07:12,963 --> 01:07:15,677
It is coated with one
of the fastest-acting

954
01:07:15,702 --> 01:07:18,476
neurotoxins known to
man, so very carefully.

955
01:07:21,752 --> 01:07:24,252
I had a lot of fun with this.

956
01:07:24,352 --> 01:07:27,052
One of our finest examples of chemical engineering.

957
01:07:27,652 --> 01:07:29,703
Poison. Harmless when ingested.

958
01:07:29,728 --> 01:07:32,176
But at a time,
convenient to you...

959
01:07:32,252 --> 01:07:35,252
it can be remotely activated.

960
01:07:35,452 --> 01:07:36,552
Primed.

961
01:07:37,639 --> 01:07:38,752
Lethal.

962
01:07:40,052 --> 01:07:43,462
And what about these? What do these do?
Electrocute you?

963
01:07:43,563 --> 01:07:46,206
- Don't be ridiculous. It's a hand grenade.
- Shut up...

964
01:07:46,307 --> 01:07:48,852
If you want to electrocute someone,
you'll need a signet ring.

965
01:07:48,952 --> 01:07:51,759
A gentleman traditionally wears
the signet on his left hand, but

966
01:07:51,784 --> 01:07:54,375
a Kingsman wears it on whatever
hand happens to be dominant.

967
01:07:54,513 --> 01:07:57,452
If you touch the contact behind the ring,
it delivers 50,000 volts.

968
01:07:58,852 --> 01:08:01,652
And what about them? What makes them so special?

969
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:04,952
Nothing. That technology is caught up
with the spy world.

970
01:08:06,752 --> 01:08:08,447
Put it back, Eggsy.

971
01:08:11,552 --> 01:08:14,052
Perfect timing. Gentleman's just finished.

972
01:08:18,952 --> 01:08:20,452
Mr. DeVere.

973
01:08:21,852 --> 01:08:23,684
What a coincidence.

974
01:08:23,709 --> 01:08:27,276
You're totally the
reason I'm here.

975
01:08:27,352 --> 01:08:32,324
When you left my house, I was searching
for that dope-ass smoking jacket you had on.

976
01:08:32,425 --> 01:08:36,252
And since I'm going as Royal Ascot,
apparently you need one of these penguin suits...

977
01:08:36,752 --> 01:08:39,452
Here I am. What are you doing here?

978
01:08:39,752 --> 01:08:42,152
What's up man? Richmond Valentine.

979
01:08:42,552 --> 01:08:45,634
This is my new valet.
I was just introducing him to my tailor.

980
01:08:45,735 --> 01:08:48,552
Another coincidence. So am I.

981
01:08:49,052 --> 01:08:52,252
- Did you have any chance to think further on my proposal?
- Most definitely.

982
01:08:52,552 --> 01:08:55,852
My people will be getting in
touch with you very soon.

983
01:08:55,877 --> 01:08:56,976
I guarantee it.

984
01:08:57,852 --> 01:09:02,015
A word of advice: Ascot requires top hat.

985
01:09:02,752 --> 01:09:06,502
I might suggest Lock & Co.
Hatters,

986
01:09:06,527 --> 01:09:07,776
St. James.

987
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:10,047
"Lox", as in smoked fish?

988
01:09:10,072 --> 01:09:12,002
As in "locked up".

989
01:09:14,952 --> 01:09:18,087
I have trouble understanding you people sometimes.

990
01:09:18,552 --> 01:09:20,952
You all talk so funny.

991
01:09:27,552 --> 01:09:30,684
Gentlemen, would you look after him please?

992
01:09:43,252 --> 01:09:46,252
Now this is a dope-ass top hat.

993
01:09:48,252 --> 01:09:51,452
Gazelle, lets go Ascotting.

994
01:09:52,952 --> 01:09:56,952
<i>Your hat is fine Bill, come on.
Don't make me late for the queen.</i>

995
01:09:57,952 --> 01:10:00,452
<i>Come on, Gazelle. We're gonna be late.</i>

996
01:10:00,852 --> 01:10:03,852
<i>How far is Ascot? How far?</i>

997
01:10:08,052 --> 01:10:10,302
Merlin said you wanted
to see me, sir?

998
01:10:10,327 --> 01:10:11,327
Sit down.

999
01:10:16,552 --> 01:10:19,552
Pretty dog. What's his name?

1000
01:10:19,652 --> 01:10:20,506
J.B.

1001
01:10:20,506 --> 01:10:22,917
 - As in "James Bond"?
- No.

1002
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:27,352
- "Jason Bourne"?
- No. Jack Bauer.

1003
01:10:28,943 --> 01:10:30,052
Bravo.

1004
01:10:30,652 --> 01:10:33,347
It pains me to admit it,
Eggsy, but I think that

1005
01:10:33,372 --> 01:10:36,176
one day you might be as
good a spy as any of them.

1006
01:10:43,652 --> 01:10:45,213
Take it.

1007
01:10:52,052 --> 01:10:53,252
Shoot the dog.

1008
01:11:00,052 --> 01:11:01,752
This weapon is live.

1009
01:11:04,652 --> 01:11:05,852
Shoot the dog.

1010
01:11:44,152 --> 01:11:45,652
Give me the gun.

1011
01:11:56,452 --> 01:11:58,652
At least the girl's got balls,

1012
01:12:02,052 --> 01:12:03,127
Get out.

1013
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,776
I knew you couldn't make it.

1014
01:12:09,152 --> 01:12:10,652
Go home.

1015
01:12:12,152 --> 01:12:14,852
Merlin, send in Roxy, please.

1016
01:12:38,652 --> 01:12:43,652
Welcome to Kingsman, Lancelot.

1017
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:13,152
Oh god, I've been so worried about you.

1018
01:13:15,052 --> 01:13:18,497
Oh my Dais, look how big you've got.

1019
01:13:24,352 --> 01:13:25,630
- Where is he?
- I am fine.

1020
01:13:25,655 --> 01:13:28,211
Eggsy, please please, just
don't get involved...

1021
01:13:28,287 --> 01:13:31,427
No, I should never have
left you on your own.

1022
01:13:31,452 --> 01:13:32,885
This stops right now.

1023
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:34,000
Be right back.

1024
01:13:39,747 --> 01:13:42,247
Oh Mugsy, so you're back?

1025
01:13:42,347 --> 01:13:44,297
You nicked a fucking taxi now?

1026
01:13:45,352 --> 01:13:48,016
Yeah. Can I have a word about my mom's
black eye?

1027
01:13:48,616 --> 01:13:50,543
You wanna have a word with
me, you get out of that cab,

1028
01:13:50,568 --> 01:13:52,965
I'll knock you straight back
down on your fucking arse.

1029
01:13:54,952 --> 01:13:57,999
Tell your muppets to go inside,
then I'll get out.

1030
01:13:59,252 --> 01:14:03,513
Go on lads. There'll be two hits:
Me and him and then he and the floor.

1031
01:14:03,952 --> 01:14:08,452
Come on in, you prick.
Let's see what you got, eh.

1032
01:14:08,552 --> 01:14:09,732
What are you doing?

1033
01:14:10,939 --> 01:14:12,800
Remote car.
What are you doing?

1034
01:14:13,091 --> 01:14:14,443
Now you've gone all bollocks.

1035
01:14:15,466 --> 01:14:17,278
Come on, he'll beat my fucking mother.

1036
01:14:17,379 --> 01:14:19,783
Come back when you've grown a pair. Mugsy.

1037
01:14:43,075 --> 01:14:44,207
You throw away

1038
01:14:44,232 --> 01:14:46,042
your biggest opportunity

1039
01:14:46,066 --> 01:14:47,649
over a fucking dog.

1040
01:14:47,701 --> 01:14:51,058
And then you humiliate me
by stealing my boss's car.

1041
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:54,339
You shot a dog just
to get a fucking job?

1042
01:14:54,364 --> 01:14:55,403
Yes, I did.

1043
01:14:57,952 --> 01:15:01,591
Mr Pickle here reminds me of that
every time I take a shit.

1044
01:15:03,252 --> 01:15:05,752
You shot your dog
and had it stuffed?

1045
01:15:06,207 --> 01:15:07,651
You fucking freak.

1046
01:15:07,752 --> 01:15:08,699
No. I shot my dog and

1047
01:15:08,724 --> 01:15:10,819
then I brought him home
and continued to care

1048
01:15:10,845 --> 01:15:13,776
for him for the next eleven years
until he died of pancreatitis.

1049
01:15:14,852 --> 01:15:17,349
- What?
- It was a blank, Eggsy.

1050
01:15:17,917 --> 01:15:19,917
It was a fucking blank.

1051
01:15:20,222 --> 01:15:22,124
Remember Amelia?

1052
01:15:22,148 --> 01:15:22,751
Yeah

1053
01:15:22,752 --> 01:15:27,052
She didn't drown. She works in our tech
department in Berlin. She's fine.

1054
01:15:27,152 --> 01:15:31,152
Limits must be tested. A Kingsman only condones the
risking of a life to save another.

1055
01:15:31,252 --> 01:15:34,351
As my father saved your life
even though your fuck-up cost his?

1056
01:15:34,452 --> 01:15:36,781
What you've get him stuffed here also?

1057
01:15:38,152 --> 01:15:41,352
Can't you see that everything I have done
has been about trying to repay him?

1058
01:15:46,952 --> 01:15:48,082
Harry, listen to this.

1059
01:15:48,107 --> 01:15:50,573
Valentine's alarm is
saying something of note.

1060
01:15:50,952 --> 01:15:53,284
<i>You know what I love about pen and paper?</i>

1061
01:15:53,652 --> 01:15:56,152
Nobody can hack into this shit.

1062
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:59,852
Our worldwide tour was a complete success.

1063
01:16:00,152 --> 01:16:02,638
We have total coverall.

1064
01:16:02,738 --> 01:16:06,485
- Like when all your numbers in bingo are crossed out.
- Bingo!

1065
01:16:06,905 --> 01:16:10,827
Bingo, the game.
You have played Bingo, right?

1066
01:16:10,952 --> 01:16:12,952
Do I look like I play bingo?

1067
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:16,106
Point is...

1068
01:16:16,652 --> 01:16:20,852
<i>if our tests go well at church tomorrow,
we are good to go.</i>

1069
01:16:21,152 --> 01:16:23,817
South Glade Mission Church.

1070
01:16:24,652 --> 01:16:26,852
- Merlin, get the plane ready.
- Will do

1071
01:16:26,952 --> 01:16:29,652
- I am so sorry. I'm gonna do..
- You should be.

1072
01:16:29,852 --> 01:16:32,552
You stay right there.
I'll sort this mess out when I get back.

1073
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:38,749
"Kentucky, U.S.A"

1074
01:16:39,317 --> 01:16:41,750
<i>And I say to you: Bear witness</i>.

1075
01:16:41,996 --> 01:16:45,136
Watch the news. Watch the news.

1076
01:16:45,237 --> 01:16:50,001
AIDS, floods
The blood of the innocents spilled.

1077
01:16:50,102 --> 01:16:55,102
And yet there are those
who doubt this is the wrath of God.

1078
01:16:57,202 --> 01:17:00,702
Our filthy government condones sodomy.

1079
01:17:01,002 --> 01:17:03,502
Divorce, abortion.

1080
01:17:03,902 --> 01:17:06,482
And yet some still doubt,

1081
01:17:06,507 --> 01:17:10,325
this is the work
of the Antichrist.

1082
01:17:10,639 --> 01:17:14,869
You do not have to be a Jew, a nigger, a whore...

1083
01:17:14,969 --> 01:17:18,564
or an atheistic science loving evolution spouter.

1084
01:17:18,730 --> 01:17:20,027
<i>Charming sermon.</i>

1085
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:22,140
Can you see Valentine anywhere?

1086
01:17:22,319 --> 01:17:27,019
So my friends, although he is a just God,
he is justly...

1087
01:17:27,190 --> 01:17:30,007
The One and there will be no turning back

1088
01:17:31,852 --> 01:17:33,229
Are you sure we
are out of range?

1089
01:17:33,254 --> 01:17:35,076
We're over a 1000 feet away.
What's wrong?

1090
01:17:35,152 --> 01:17:38,152
- What if the calculations are wrong?
- You just have to trust me.

1091
01:17:39,330 --> 01:17:41,900
Jews, nigger, fag lovers.

1092
01:17:42,052 --> 01:17:45,552
And the devil is burning them for all eternity.

1093
01:17:45,652 --> 01:17:46,852
Excuse me.

1094
01:17:47,852 --> 01:17:49,374
Where are you going?

1095
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:51,376
Hey, what's your problem?

1096
01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:55,516
I am a Catholic whore,
currently enjoying congress

1097
01:17:55,541 --> 01:17:58,351
out of wedlock with my
black Jewish boyfriend...

1098
01:17:58,427 --> 01:18:00,867
who works in a military abortion clinic.

1099
01:18:01,052 --> 01:18:04,677
So hail Satan. And have a lovely afternoon, madam.

1100
01:18:08,043 --> 01:18:11,043
Oh shit, he's leaving. I'm starting the test now.

1101
01:18:11,475 --> 01:18:13,852
Hope enough of these freaks have our SIM cards.

1102
01:18:18,350 --> 01:18:20,350
...ask you to sit down...

1103
01:18:20,451 --> 01:18:23,592
Leave this church like the infidel you are.

1104
01:18:27,652 --> 01:18:32,452
You will eat your babies.
You will drown in the blood of the Lord.

1105
01:18:32,552 --> 01:18:34,746
He will cast.

1106
01:18:40,798 --> 01:18:42,030
Holy fuck.

1107
01:18:43,248 --> 01:18:45,621
Shit, I can't watch this. Get over here.

1108
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,500
Jesus...

1109
01:19:30,552 --> 01:19:32,752
<i>Galahad, can you hear me?</i>

1110
01:19:33,252 --> 01:19:36,452
Harry, Harry.. what the heck is going on?

1111
01:19:38,252 --> 01:19:39,572
Just turn the volume down please.

1112
01:19:40,852 --> 01:19:42,560
I didn't expect it to
be that effective.

1113
01:19:42,585 --> 01:19:44,376
What kind of response
are we talking of?

1114
01:19:44,852 --> 01:19:46,052
100%.

1115
01:19:47,052 --> 01:19:50,252
So everyone's been infected
Whether they have SIM card or not?

1116
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:52,952
And its added benefit of wiping out the Kingsman.

1117
01:19:53,352 --> 01:19:55,001
Not yet.

1118
01:20:49,952 --> 01:20:51,652
Oh you need to see this.

1119
01:22:48,252 --> 01:22:52,222
What did you do to me?
I had no control.

1120
01:22:53,452 --> 01:22:55,652
I killed all those people.

1121
01:22:56,852 --> 01:22:59,352
- I wanted to.
- Clever, isn't it?

1122
01:22:59,452 --> 01:23:02,645
In simple terms, its a
neurological wave that triggers

1123
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:05,862
the centers of aggression
and switches off inhibitor.

1124
01:23:05,952 --> 01:23:09,452
Transmitted through your nasty free SIM cards, I assume?

1125
01:23:12,652 --> 01:23:14,378
You know what this is like?

1126
01:23:14,552 --> 01:23:17,952
Its like those old movies we both love.

1127
01:23:18,052 --> 01:23:20,252
Now I'm gonna tell you my whole plan...

1128
01:23:20,352 --> 01:23:24,252
and then I'm gonna come up with some
absurd, convoluted way to kill you...

1129
01:23:24,352 --> 01:23:27,452
and then you'll find an equally
convoluted way to escape.

1130
01:23:28,252 --> 01:23:29,752
That sounds good to me.

1131
01:23:30,552 --> 01:23:32,552
Well, this ain't that kind of movie.

1132
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:38,980
No

1133
01:23:46,952 --> 01:23:48,713
Is he dead?

1134
01:23:48,852 --> 01:23:51,332
That's usually what happens when
you shoot someone in the head.

1135
01:23:51,352 --> 01:23:55,816
- It feels good, Right?
- No no, it does not feel good. It felt fucking awful.

1136
01:23:56,152 --> 01:23:58,702
What? You just killed how
many people in that church.

1137
01:23:58,727 --> 01:23:59,576
This is one guy.

1138
01:23:59,652 --> 01:24:01,852
No..No... No, they killed each other.

1139
01:24:04,152 --> 01:24:06,683
Okay, send off the
countdown clock

1140
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:08,676
This party starts tomorrow.

1141
01:24:43,352 --> 01:24:44,807
Arthur?

1142
01:24:46,852 --> 01:24:50,552
- Are you there?
- <i>Sadly, I am</i>.

1143
01:24:51,152 --> 01:24:54,145
Assemble the Kingsman.

1144
01:24:58,652 --> 01:25:02,675
<i>Can't you see that everything I have done
has been about trying to repay him?</i>

1145
01:25:23,044 --> 01:25:25,230
<i>I see a young man
with potential,</i>

1146
01:25:25,255 --> 01:25:28,276
<i>who wants to do something
good with his life.</i>

1147
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
<i>Kingsman</i>

1148
01:25:45,452 --> 01:25:47,952
Arthur, Harry is dead.

1149
01:25:48,552 --> 01:25:50,502
Galahad is dead.

1150
01:25:51,052 --> 01:25:54,052
Hence, we have just drunk a toast to him.

1151
01:25:54,152 --> 01:25:56,768
Well then you know what that psycho's doing.

1152
01:25:56,869 --> 01:25:59,453
How many people in the world have got those SIM cards?

1153
01:25:59,552 --> 01:26:01,322
Valentine can send a signal
to any of them.

1154
01:26:01,347 --> 01:26:04,575
All of them. If they all go homicidal at
the same time, then..

1155
01:26:04,652 --> 01:26:06,943
Indeed, and thanks to
Galahad recordings

1156
01:26:07,068 --> 01:26:09,300
we have Valentine's confession.

1157
01:26:09,552 --> 01:26:13,052
The intelligence has been passed on to the
relevant authorities.

1158
01:26:13,252 --> 01:26:14,752
Our work is complete.

1159
01:26:14,777 --> 01:26:19,276
And a most distinguished legacy
for our fallen friend it is too.

1160
01:26:20,052 --> 01:26:21,252
And that's it?

1161
01:26:22,252 --> 01:26:23,952
Come sit down, boy.

1162
01:26:26,852 --> 01:26:32,052
This is an 1815 Napoleonic brandy.

1163
01:26:32,952 --> 01:26:36,852
And we only drink it
when we lose a Kingsman.

1164
01:26:36,952 --> 01:26:39,723
Galahad was very fond of you.

1165
01:26:41,952 --> 01:26:45,952
And on this occasion, I think it is
acceptable for us...

1166
01:26:46,952 --> 01:26:48,652
to bend the rules a little.

1167
01:26:50,152 --> 01:26:53,652
- These are all Kingsmen?
- Yes, our founder members.

1168
01:26:55,352 --> 01:26:57,852
I want you to join me in a toast.

1169
01:26:59,752 --> 01:27:00,952
To Galahad.

1170
01:27:03,509 --> 01:27:05,509
To Galahad.

1171
01:27:08,752 --> 01:27:11,835
Harry said you don't like
to break the rules, often.

1172
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:12,887
Why now?

1173
01:27:13,025 --> 01:27:14,708
You're very good, Eggsy.

1174
01:27:14,733 --> 01:27:18,870
Perhaps I'll make you my
proposal for Galahad's position.

1175
01:27:19,052 --> 01:27:21,511
Provided we can see eye to eye

1176
01:27:21,536 --> 01:27:24,076
on certain political matters.

1177
01:27:26,952 --> 01:27:28,891
Can you guess..

1178
01:27:28,916 --> 01:27:31,004
What this is?

1179
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,421
I don't have to.
Harry showed it.

1180
01:27:33,446 --> 01:27:34,718
You click it, I die.

1181
01:27:34,852 --> 01:27:37,052
I thought that brandy tasted a bit shit.

1182
01:27:38,448 --> 01:27:39,552
Bravo.

1183
01:27:39,852 --> 01:27:43,052
Valentine won you over. Somehow

1184
01:27:43,252 --> 01:27:46,252
Once he explained, I understood.

1185
01:27:46,352 --> 01:27:48,852
When you get a virus, you get a fever.

1186
01:27:49,152 --> 01:27:52,945
That's the human body raising its
core temperature to kill the virus.

1187
01:27:53,352 --> 01:27:57,852
Planet Earth works the same way:
Global warming is the fever...

1188
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:00,012
Mankind is the virus.

1189
01:28:00,037 --> 01:28:03,176
We are making our planet sick.

1190
01:28:03,452 --> 01:28:05,934
A cull is our only hope.

1191
01:28:06,052 --> 01:28:08,755
If we do not reduce our
population ourselves,

1192
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:10,777
there's only two
ways this can go:

1193
01:28:11,352 --> 01:28:15,352
The host kills the virus,
or the virus kills the host.

1194
01:28:15,852 --> 01:28:18,743
- Either way...
- The result is the same:

1195
01:28:19,352 --> 01:28:21,552
The virus dies.

1196
01:28:22,352 --> 01:28:25,693
So Valentine's gonna take care
of the population problem himself.

1197
01:28:25,952 --> 01:28:28,552
If we don't do something, Nature will.

1198
01:28:28,652 --> 01:28:32,652
Sometimes a culling is the only way to
ensure that this species survives.

1199
01:28:33,652 --> 01:28:38,552
And History will see Valentine as the man
who saved humanity from extinction.

1200
01:28:38,652 --> 01:28:41,652
And he gets to pick and choose who gets culled, does he?

1201
01:28:42,052 --> 01:28:46,132
All his rich mates, they get to live. And then when he
thinks its worth saving, he's keeping them safe.

1202
01:28:46,352 --> 01:28:50,852
- Whether they agree with him or not.
- And you, Eggsy.

1203
01:28:51,152 --> 01:28:57,615
In Harry's honor, I am inviting you to
be part of a new world.

1204
01:29:00,052 --> 01:29:02,752
It's time to make your decision.

1205
01:29:09,252 --> 01:29:12,027
I would rather be with Harry.

1206
01:29:12,052 --> 01:29:13,052
Thanks.

1207
01:29:13,352 --> 01:29:14,552
So be it.

1208
01:29:31,152 --> 01:29:34,060
The problem with us
common types is,

1209
01:29:34,085 --> 01:29:36,285
that we are light fingered.

1210
01:29:37,252 --> 01:29:38,980
Kingsman's taught me a lot.

1211
01:29:39,005 --> 01:29:40,476
But slight of hand...

1212
01:29:40,952 --> 01:29:42,652
<i>Yes, they're our our founder members.</i>

1213
01:29:45,261 --> 01:29:47,152
...I had that done already.

1214
01:29:49,892 --> 01:29:54,198
You dirty little fucking prick.

1215
01:30:20,152 --> 01:30:23,352


1216
01:30:28,552 --> 01:30:33,239
It's okay, Lancelot. Put it down.
It's verified.

1217
01:30:35,352 --> 01:30:37,389
Arthur's phone's just
received an update text about

1218
01:30:37,414 --> 01:30:39,176
getting to safety. We
don't have a lot time.

1219
01:30:39,252 --> 01:30:42,017
- What you gonna do?
- The question is what we gonna do.

1220
01:30:42,352 --> 01:30:44,852
God knows who's in Valentine's
pocket and who's not.

1221
01:30:45,752 --> 01:30:47,279
We've no choice.

1222
01:30:48,252 --> 01:30:50,452
We are gonna have to deal with this ourselves.

1223
01:30:53,796 --> 01:30:55,033
Follow me.

1224
01:31:14,493 --> 01:31:18,151
- The fuck is this?
- I have no idea.

1225
01:31:18,252 --> 01:31:19,586
What you're playing with...

1226
01:31:19,687 --> 01:31:22,444
is a prototype personal trans-atmospheric vehicle.

1227
01:31:22,545 --> 01:31:25,596
It was developed as part of
Reagan's Star Wars project.

1228
01:31:25,621 --> 01:31:27,975
Its pretty basic, but
it should still work.

1229
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:30,552
We're going to take out one of Valentine's satellites.

1230
01:31:30,852 --> 01:31:33,352
We're gonna break the chain. Stop the signal.

1231
01:31:33,552 --> 01:31:35,552
It will take him a couple of hours to reboot it.

1232
01:31:35,752 --> 01:31:39,922
Which buys us enough time for you to get me
into Valentine's mainframe...

1233
01:31:40,022 --> 01:31:42,022
so I can shut it down.

1234
01:31:42,361 --> 01:31:46,352
Lancelot, you are going to be using it.
Get into your halo suit.

1235
01:31:55,352 --> 01:31:57,852
Swedish Air Force

1236
01:31:58,334 --> 01:32:01,152
<i>The Swedish Prime Minister requesting
permission to land.</i>

1237
01:32:06,352 --> 01:32:08,244
<i>Permission granted.</i>

1238
01:32:11,952 --> 01:32:13,952
- Please.
- Thank you.

1239
01:32:14,452 --> 01:32:18,126
- So how many more are we expecting?
- Not many. Most have their own bunkers.

1240
01:32:18,452 --> 01:32:21,439
I figure we're just getting really nervous once.

1241
01:32:21,952 --> 01:32:23,652
Welcome, Prime Minister.

1242
01:32:25,252 --> 01:32:28,552
It seems the implant can emit
some kind of counter signal...

1243
01:32:28,652 --> 01:32:32,040
to ensure the wearer remains unaffected
by the waves from the SIM card.

1244
01:32:32,252 --> 01:32:34,452
The waves that turns everyone into a psycho killer?

1245
01:32:34,552 --> 01:32:37,105
Quite. But what they probably didn't
tell anyone...

1246
01:32:37,306 --> 01:32:41,229
Is that it can also super heat
their soft tissue at his command.

1247
01:32:41,552 --> 01:32:45,621
Valentine's selected his chosen few
to get the countdown warning.

1248
01:32:46,052 --> 01:32:48,892
He had to be sure that it didn't
blow up to the wrong people beforehand.

1249
01:32:48,952 --> 01:32:50,895
And how does this help us right now?

1250
01:32:51,852 --> 01:32:54,552
It doesn't. Roxy, here we go.

1251
01:33:07,252 --> 01:33:10,512
The higher you go,
The more the balloons expand.

1252
01:33:10,952 --> 01:33:14,452
When you reach the edge of the atmosphere,
they will explode.

1253
01:33:15,152 --> 01:33:17,518
You need to deploy your missile
just before that, okay?

1254
01:33:17,543 --> 01:33:18,810
The edge of the atmosphere.

1255
01:33:18,952 --> 01:33:22,152
And once you've deployed, you'll need
to release for descent fast.

1256
01:33:23,152 --> 01:33:24,393
Good luck.

1257
01:33:26,652 --> 01:33:28,246
You can do this, okay?

1258
01:33:28,890 --> 01:33:31,687
Eggsy, come on.
Time is not our friend.

1259
01:33:54,352 --> 01:33:57,652
Getting in with Arthur's invitation,
you gonna need to blend in.

1260
01:33:57,752 --> 01:34:01,472
- I'm supposed to be Arthur?
- His invitation's in his phone.

1261
01:34:01,601 --> 01:34:04,052
Give them this and give
his real name: Chester King.

1262
01:34:04,252 --> 01:34:06,752
- And what about you?
- I'm the pilot. I'm gonna stay here.

1263
01:34:07,452 --> 01:34:08,986
Is that gonna fit me?

1264
01:34:09,011 --> 01:34:11,274
A bespoke suit always fits.

1265
01:34:11,552 --> 01:34:14,177
Just be grateful Harry
had it made for you.

1266
01:34:14,202 --> 01:34:15,202
Get dressed.

1267
01:34:16,952 --> 01:34:18,139
The fuck's wrong with them?

1268
01:34:18,164 --> 01:34:20,976
I don't know. Could have something
to do with mass genocide?

1269
01:34:21,052 --> 01:34:23,138
Give me the mic.

1270
01:34:26,552 --> 01:34:28,052
Everybody listen up.

1271
01:34:29,548 --> 01:34:31,958
What the fuck wrong with you people?

1272
01:34:32,152 --> 01:34:37,652
I just want to remind you that today
is a day of celebration.

1273
01:34:38,552 --> 01:34:42,066
We must put aside
all thoughts of death,

1274
01:34:42,091 --> 01:34:44,310
and focus on birth.

1275
01:34:44,576 --> 01:34:48,391
The birth of a new age.

1276
01:34:48,752 --> 01:34:52,952
<i>We mustn't mourn those who
give their lives today.</i>

1277
01:34:53,752 --> 01:34:56,152
<i>We should honor their sacrifice.</i>

1278
01:34:56,252 --> 01:34:58,152
She got my number to call me back...?

1279
01:34:58,252 --> 01:35:01,952
<i>And their role in saving
the human race.</i>

1280
01:35:03,810 --> 01:35:08,792
We must put aside doubts and guilts.

1281
01:35:09,052 --> 01:35:13,252
You are the chosen people.

1282
01:35:14,152 --> 01:35:19,152
When folks tell their kids the story of Noah's Ark,
is Noah the bad guy?

1283
01:35:19,652 --> 01:35:22,352
Is God the bad guy?

1284
01:35:22,652 --> 01:35:25,652
How about the animals marching two by two?

1285
01:35:26,152 --> 01:35:27,652
Of course not.

1286
01:35:28,252 --> 01:35:33,252
Yes, that's it. So let's turn
that frown upside down.

1287
01:35:33,852 --> 01:35:39,571
Eat, drink and party.

1288
01:35:40,452 --> 01:35:43,452
And I'll see you all in the new age.

1289
01:36:07,951 --> 01:36:11,699
<i>Rox, its me. How's the view?</i>

1290
01:36:14,652 --> 01:36:17,052
- Hideous.
<i>- Mine's pretty sweet.</i>

1291
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:20,007
- They made you one of these suits yet?
<i>- No, not yet.</i>

1292
01:36:20,152 --> 01:36:22,569
<i>That's something to
look forward to then.</i>

1293
01:36:22,594 --> 01:36:25,298
<i>We're coming up on Valentine's base.
Gotta go.</i>

1294
01:36:26,752 --> 01:36:28,059
<i>Good luck.</i>

1295
01:36:35,552 --> 01:36:37,252
Looking good, Eggsy.

1296
01:36:39,179 --> 01:36:41,601
Feeling good, Merlin.

1297
01:36:47,252 --> 01:36:51,291
This is November 2-4-7 Charlie Kilo requesting
permission to land.

1298
01:36:54,452 --> 01:36:55,952
<i>Permission is granted.</i>

1299
01:37:00,903 --> 01:37:03,286
Fuck me.

1300
01:37:29,744 --> 01:37:31,950
Eggsy, We're on.

1301
01:37:46,852 --> 01:37:48,052
Chester King.

1302
01:37:48,752 --> 01:37:50,470
Mr. King, welcome.

1303
01:37:50,657 --> 01:37:55,025
I'm sure you've adhered to Mr Valentine's
strict no weapons policy...

1304
01:37:55,052 --> 01:37:55,696
but if you don't object..

1305
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:57,278
- Of course.
- Thank you

1306
01:37:57,852 --> 01:37:59,940
Do you have any luggage?

1307
01:38:00,952 --> 01:38:04,852
Congratulations, Mycroft. You just
graduated from my pilot to my valet.

1308
01:38:04,952 --> 01:38:07,577
- Cheeky.
- Understood?

1309
01:38:07,602 --> 01:38:08,602
Good.

1310
01:38:10,052 --> 01:38:11,306
Thank you.

1311
01:38:37,352 --> 01:38:40,488
<i>Eggsy, find a laptop.
Get me online.</i>

1312
01:38:40,513 --> 01:38:42,376
<i>The clock is ticking.</i>

1313
01:38:42,852 --> 01:38:45,552
<i>And remember: Try to blend in.</i>

1314
01:38:45,852 --> 01:38:47,852
Would sir care for a drink?

1315
01:38:48,352 --> 01:38:49,801
Martini. Gin,

1316
01:38:49,826 --> 01:38:52,276
not vodka, obviously.

1317
01:38:52,352 --> 01:38:56,102
Stirred for 10 seconds while glancing
it an unopened bottle of vermouth.

1318
01:38:56,127 --> 01:38:57,376
Thank you.

1319
01:39:00,452 --> 01:39:02,414
Merlin, you clock in this?

1320
01:39:02,439 --> 01:39:04,476
Yes I am. Stay focused.

1321
01:39:05,152 --> 01:39:07,652
Lancelot, you're doing great.
Not much further to go.

1322
01:39:07,952 --> 01:39:09,152
<i>Yes, Merlin.</i>

1323
01:39:10,652 --> 01:39:12,852
<i>Eggsy, get me online. Now.</i>

1324
01:39:14,152 --> 01:39:15,352
Yep. I'm on it.

1325
01:39:16,452 --> 01:39:18,980
Lancelot, you're approaching
your altitude limit.

1326
01:39:19,005 --> 01:39:20,976
These balloons won't
last much longer.

1327
01:39:21,652 --> 01:39:23,352
<i>Start to engage missile.</i>

1328
01:39:38,952 --> 01:39:41,952
The society is dead.
Long live society.

1329
01:39:43,452 --> 01:39:44,652
Amen to that.

1330
01:39:46,452 --> 01:39:48,577
- Morten Lindström.
- Chester King.

1331
01:39:48,602 --> 01:39:49,976
How'd you get online?

1332
01:39:50,052 --> 01:39:53,833
Oh well, it's a closed network, you see.
For authorized connections only.

1333
01:39:57,552 --> 01:39:59,152
I've got a fix on the satellite.

1334
01:39:59,252 --> 01:39:59,938
Do you have the correct time?

1335
01:39:59,938 --> 01:40:01,571
I think I'm still
on my last time zone.

1336
01:40:01,642 --> 01:40:03,450
Oh yeah. Lets see now.

1337
01:40:14,752 --> 01:40:17,328


1338
01:40:17,428 --> 01:40:19,341
Eggsy, I'm in. Get
your arse back to the plane now.

1339
01:40:19,341 --> 01:40:20,133
I'm on my way.

1340
01:40:20,152 --> 01:40:23,652
Lancelot, good luck. Firing in three, two...

1341
01:40:30,922 --> 01:40:32,052
Nice and slow.

1342
01:40:32,153 --> 01:40:33,531
What the fuck are
you doing here?

1343
01:40:33,556 --> 01:40:35,663
Well, my family was naturally invited.
Obviously.

1344
01:40:35,769 --> 01:40:37,769
Now get the fuck up. Slowly.

1345
01:40:39,311 --> 01:40:40,647
Lancelot, hurry up and fire.

1346
01:40:40,672 --> 01:40:42,294
The other balloon is gonna blow.

1347
01:40:42,456 --> 01:40:45,520
<i>Yes, Merlin. I've nearly got it.
Give me a second.</i>

1348
01:40:47,356 --> 01:40:50,335
Valentine, I've caught a fucking spy.

1349
01:40:50,702 --> 01:40:52,358
V-Glass, zoom.

1350
01:40:53,294 --> 01:40:55,294
It's that young valet.

1351
01:40:58,208 --> 01:40:59,673
Son of a bitch.

1352
01:40:59,773 --> 01:41:00,943
<i>Got it.</i>

1353
01:41:11,539 --> 01:41:13,152
Oh shit. Sound the alarm.

1354
01:41:15,217 --> 01:41:16,507
I'm not taking any chances.

1355
01:41:16,678 --> 01:41:19,362
Okay, you send out two minutes warnings. I'm
starting the override.

1356
01:41:22,352 --> 01:41:23,852
<i>Countdown initiated.</i>

1357
01:41:30,452 --> 01:41:31,661


1358
01:41:33,152 --> 01:41:34,652
- You see him?
- Right here.

1359
01:41:43,852 --> 01:41:47,052
Eggsy, take a left. Two guards up ahead.

1360
01:41:59,352 --> 01:42:01,052
Lancelot, release now.

1361
01:42:11,452 --> 01:42:14,452
<i>Eggsy, straight ahead and then right.
There's two more.</i>

1362
01:42:18,352 --> 01:42:21,752
All right, everybody on your feet. Countdown to V-Day.

1363
01:42:22,252 --> 01:42:23,952
<i>Welcome into new age.</i>

1364
01:42:48,352 --> 01:42:51,125
Eggsy, next left. Got a narrow tunnel.

1365
01:42:59,748 --> 01:43:01,065
<i>Here we go.</i>

1366

- We can't.

This is mine.

1400
01:44:48,250 --> 01:44:50,480
I'll show you yours.

1401

Good choice.

1402
01:45:11,873 --> 01:45:13,407
How long to relink
the satellite chain?

1403
01:45:13,432 --> 01:45:14,734
It can take an hour.
Maybe two.

1404
01:45:14,810 --> 01:45:17,241
Bullshit. Just bring these
two closer together.

But that's not yours.

1406

V-glass, call E-man.

1407

E, its V. Listen man, I got a
little hiccup on this end.

1408
01:45:30,356 --> 01:45:31,576
I need a piggyback.

1409

down but is right next to one of yours.

make that happen?

1411
01:45:42,852 --> 01:45:44,028
Go.

1412
01:45:48,052 --> 01:45:50,052

He's gonna reconnect the chain.

1416

Get a move on.

- Is that Kingsman kid dead yet?
- Not yet. But he will be soon.

1420
01:47:03,852 --> 01:47:05,097
Good.

1421
01:47:18,492 --> 01:47:20,218
Merlin, I'm fucked.

1422
01:47:32,657 --> 01:47:33,822
As am I.

1423
01:47:33,946 --> 01:47:36,591
They're coming at me from both sides.
I'm out of options.

1424
01:47:36,752 --> 01:47:39,252
Rox, I need a favor.

1425
01:47:39,626 --> 01:47:43,096
Call my mum and tell her to
lock herself away from Dean

1426
01:47:43,121 --> 01:47:44,277
and the baby.

1427
01:47:45,752 --> 01:47:47,252
And tell her I love her.

1428
01:48:01,252 --> 01:48:04,752
Merlin, you remember those implants you
said were of no use to us?

1429
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,941
Any chance you could turn them on?

1430
01:48:10,952 --> 01:48:14,452
My turn to play, Valentine.

1431
01:48:23,239 --> 01:48:25,352
Oh no. What the fuck is he...

1432
01:48:25,376 --> 01:48:27,376
I cant stop this.

1433
01:48:38,169 --> 01:48:40,169
ACTIVATE SECURITY IMPLANTS?

1434
01:48:40,292 --> 01:48:41,833
Yes, please.

1435
01:48:43,552 --> 01:48:45,752
SECURITY IMPLANTS ACTIVATED

1436
01:48:45,776 --> 01:48:47,776
Nooo....

1437
01:49:45,244 --> 01:49:47,131
That was fucking spectacular.

1438
01:49:47,364 --> 01:49:49,702
Merlin, you're a fucking genius.

1439
01:49:50,166 --> 01:49:53,496
What the fuck is happening out there?

1440
01:49:57,763 --> 01:49:59,792
Aren't you that princess
who went missing?

1441
01:49:59,817 --> 01:50:00,854
Can you get me out?

1442
01:50:01,052 --> 01:50:02,802
Well if I do, will
you give me a kiss?

1443
01:50:02,827 --> 01:50:04,576
I've always wanted
to kiss a princess.

1444
01:50:04,653 --> 01:50:07,293
If you get me out right now,
I will give you more than just a kiss.

1445
01:50:08,844 --> 01:50:10,151
You motherfucker.

1446
01:50:10,252 --> 01:50:12,045
<i>Did you really I
was stupid enough</i>

1447
01:50:12,070 --> 01:50:14,476
<i>to implant one of those
things in my own head?</i>

1448
01:50:14,752 --> 01:50:16,452
<i>What are you? Fucking crazy?</i>

1449
01:50:17,452 --> 01:50:19,952
All those innocent people killed and for what?

1450
01:50:20,652 --> 01:50:23,352
You didn't stop shit.

1451
01:50:25,052 --> 01:50:26,855
Fine, I have locked the door.
What do you want me to do now?

1452
01:50:26,863 --> 01:50:30,276
As I said, put your daughter in the
bathroom and throw away the key.

1453
01:50:30,452 --> 01:50:32,602
It's still happening.

1454
01:50:33,206 --> 01:50:35,629
- You fucking insane?
<i>- Just do it</i>.

1455
01:51:02,752 --> 01:51:04,594
Eggsy, the signal's started.

1456
01:51:04,619 --> 01:51:07,776
Get Valentine's hand off
that bloody desk now.

1457
01:51:07,952 --> 01:51:10,452
Sorry, love. Gotta save the world.

1458
01:51:10,552 --> 01:51:14,038
If you save the world,
would you do me in the asshole?

1459
01:51:15,450 --> 01:51:17,087
I will be right back.

1460
01:51:18,552 --> 01:51:19,674
Good luck.

1461
01:51:26,252 --> 01:51:27,570
London.

1462
01:51:55,701 --> 01:51:56,844
Rio.

1463
01:52:12,622 --> 01:52:13,752
Get down.

1464
01:52:15,452 --> 01:52:16,652
You did it.

1465
01:52:25,852 --> 01:52:27,889
This glass is not gonna hold long.

1466
01:52:29,552 --> 01:52:31,176
You stay here.

1467
01:52:33,252 --> 01:52:36,241
- Merlin, quickly how do I get up there?
- Keep shooting. I'm find a route.

1468
01:52:36,290 --> 01:52:38,190
Understood.

1469
01:53:13,352 --> 01:53:16,352
We are back up.

1470
01:53:23,652 --> 01:53:25,152
This is great.

1471
01:53:33,405 --> 01:53:35,525
Eggsy, fucking get on with it.

1472
01:53:36,133 --> 01:53:37,633
Kick his ass, darling.

1473
01:53:43,852 --> 01:53:46,552
Seoul, Caracas, Mumbai.

1474
01:53:55,081 --> 01:53:57,081
Kill that motherfucking ...

1475
01:54:14,181 --> 01:54:16,728
Eggsy, the world is going to shit.

1476
01:54:26,352 --> 01:54:28,452
- Is he dead yet?
- Not yet.

1477
01:54:28,552 --> 01:54:31,252
Stop playing with your foot. Kill him.

1478
01:55:49,952 --> 01:55:51,152
Gazelle.

1479
01:55:51,176 --> 01:55:53,176
Gazelle!

1480
01:56:04,152 --> 01:56:06,152
<i>Come on.</i>

1481
01:56:08,660 --> 01:56:09,856
<i>Kill him.</i>

1482
01:56:52,852 --> 01:56:54,352
<i>Well done son.</i>

1483
01:56:55,640 --> 01:56:56,642
Yes!

1484
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:57,580
Yes! Eggsy

1485
01:56:57,852 --> 01:56:59,460
Well done, Eggsy.

1486
01:56:59,485 --> 01:57:01,376
And you, Lancelot.

1487
01:57:03,752 --> 01:57:07,230
I am sorry. Mommy
would never hurt you.

1488
01:57:07,255 --> 01:57:09,776
Mommy would never hurt you.
I am so sorry.

1489
01:57:12,627 --> 01:57:13,752
You okay?

1490
01:57:17,452 --> 01:57:19,452
Harry would be proud of you, Eggsy.

1491
01:57:20,652 --> 01:57:21,852
He was right.

1492
01:57:37,451 --> 01:57:39,246
'Sup man?

1493
01:57:39,347 --> 01:57:43,052
Is this the part where you say some
really bad pun?

1494
01:57:43,852 --> 01:57:45,754
Its like you said to Harry:

1495
01:57:49,015 --> 01:57:51,215
This ain't that kind of movie, bro.

1496
01:57:52,852 --> 01:57:54,052
Perfect.

1497
01:58:14,852 --> 01:58:15,799
Eggsy, where you going?

1498
01:58:15,824 --> 01:58:18,376
There's no need for champagne
We have got lots on the plane.

1499
01:58:25,552 --> 01:58:27,541
Did you save the world?

1500
01:58:27,566 --> 01:58:28,776
Yes I did.

1501
01:58:31,547 --> 01:58:33,678
So, You gonna come in?

1502
01:58:33,703 --> 01:58:35,123
Yes, I am.

1503
01:58:40,238 --> 01:58:42,532
Merlin, this cell's locked.
How do I get in?

1504
01:58:44,852 --> 01:58:46,446
<i>26-25.</i>

1505
01:58:50,741 --> 01:58:53,502
Merlin, you're the governor.

1506
01:58:55,374 --> 01:58:57,757
<i>You owe me, Eggsy.</i>

1507
01:59:03,769 --> 01:59:05,769
Eggsy

1508
01:59:10,376 --> 01:59:12,282
Oh my word.

1509
01:59:59,370 --> 02:00:02,265
Michelle, turn that shit off, its
turning me nutty.

1510
02:00:03,103 --> 02:00:04,948
I rather like that song.

1511
02:00:05,091 --> 02:00:07,012
Leave it on eh, Mom.

1512
02:00:10,395 --> 02:00:12,417
Mugsy's back.

1513
02:00:12,724 --> 02:00:14,964
You finally come to have that
word with me, have you son?

1514
02:00:15,379 --> 02:00:17,020
Or are you going to run
away again and pretend

1515
02:00:17,045 --> 02:00:18,615
you're getting another
coat dress like that?

1516
02:00:18,691 --> 02:00:20,691
You mean this?

1517
02:00:21,633 --> 02:00:23,284
No.

1518
02:00:23,631 --> 02:00:26,977
I know this bloke who's just taken
over a tailor shop up on Seville Road.

1519
02:00:27,338 --> 02:00:29,338
He's got me a job, Mom.

1520
02:00:30,112 --> 02:00:32,112
Comes with a lot of perks.

1521
02:00:32,752 --> 02:00:34,752
Including a house.

1522
02:00:35,558 --> 02:00:37,558
Come and live with me there, Mum.

1523
02:00:38,189 --> 02:00:40,189
- Come on.
- Sit down, you.

1524
02:00:41,114 --> 02:00:44,365
Only place she'll be visiting is
you in fucking hospital, do you hear?

1525
02:00:44,465 --> 02:00:47,928
Just leave him alone.
Eggsy, go please. Just go away.

1526
02:00:49,089 --> 02:00:50,585
All right

1527
02:00:50,788 --> 02:00:52,410
Yes, just do as mommy says.

1528
02:00:52,511 --> 02:00:54,655
Why don't you ask that tailor
friend of yours to knock up

1529
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:56,706
a nice chicken costume,
it would suit you ya mug.

1530
02:00:59,641 --> 02:01:02,107
As a good friend once said:

1531
02:01:03,364 --> 02:01:04,703
Manners...

1532
02:01:06,207 --> 02:01:07,488
maketh...

1533
02:01:10,248 --> 02:01:11,929
man.

1534
02:01:12,271 --> 02:01:14,156
- Dean?
- Shut the fuck up.

1535
02:01:14,342 --> 02:01:16,695
Eggsy, I'm gonna shove your manners
up your fucking...

1536
02:01:21,871 --> 02:01:23,766
So...

1537
02:01:23,791 --> 02:01:28,155
Are we going to stand around here all day,
or are we going to fight?

1538
02:01:30,841 --> 02:01:51,079
