3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,730
一个匿名消息源提供了这段视频

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,730
in London. An anonymous source provided this video.

5
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,350
视频内容为昆汀·贝克 又名神秘客死前的一刻

6
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,350
It shows Quentin Beck, aka.Mysterio, moments before his death.

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,030

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,030
A warning, you may find this video disturbing.

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,200
我想方设法地把元素众送回他们的维度

10
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,200
I managed to send the Elemental back through the rift but I

11
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,060
但我觉得我没办法活着离开这座桥了

12
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,060
don't think I'm gonna make it out of this bridge alive.

13
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,930
蜘蛛侠不知为何攻击了我

14
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,930
Spider-Man attacked me for some reason. He has

15
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,790
他手握着一只配备斯塔克科技的武装无人机军团

16
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,790
an army of weaponized drones, Stark technology.

17
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,310
他说他才是世界上唯一能成为钢铁侠接班人的人

18
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,310
He's saying he's the only one who's gonna be the new Iron Man, no one else.

19
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,780
是否确认执行无人机攻击指令

20
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,780
Are you sure you want to commence the drone

21
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,910
这会带来很大数量的伤亡

22
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,910
attack? There will be significant casualties.

23
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,670
确认 把他们全部处决掉

24
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,670
Do it. Execute them all.

00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,490
Just make yourself home...

159
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,270
是有关性方面的事 彼得

160
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,270
... about sex, Peter.

161
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,400
这跟性一点关系都没有

162
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,400
This has nothing to do with sex.

163
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,560
看在上帝的份上 如果你先再来一次的话...

164
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,560
God's sakes, it's the goal but if you wanna go over it again...

165
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,080
我的意思是…那是什么声音

166
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,080
I mean, I'm... What's that sound?

167
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,660
嘿 蜘蛛侠

168
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,660
Hey, Spider-Man!

169
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,800
我的意思是 如果你想复合的话我其实很乐意 我只是不想…

170
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,800
I mean, I'm happy to rehash it if you want to. I just don't...

171
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,840
你能不能先别玩手机了

172
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,840
Can you get off your phones for five minutes,

173
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,300
我只是想跟你聊聊我们之间的关系 好吗

174
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,300
I just wanna talk to you about your relationship, okay?

175
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,340
彼得

176
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,340
Peter?

177
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,640
什么

178
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,640
What?

179
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,670
那是… 开什么玩笑

180
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,670
- Is that... - Is that here?

181
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,060
我觉得也许没什么大不了的

182
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,060
I mean maybe it's not such a big deal.

183
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,370
蜘蛛威胁

184
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,370
Spider-Menace!

185
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,490
世界各地的政府开启了对凶手

186
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,490
Governments around the world launched investigations

187
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,020
蜘蛛侠 又名彼得帕克

188
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,020
into the murderer known as Spider-Man,

189
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,110
又名蛛网头 一个数年来威胁纽约市民

190
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,110
aka, Peter Parker, aka, the web-headed war criminal,

191
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,130
生命安全的战犯的调查工作

192
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,130
who for years has been terrorizing the decent citizens of New York.

193
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,850
现在 整座城市和世界都会看到他的真实面目

194
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,850
Well now, this city and the world see him for what he truly is.

195
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,110
一个杀人凶手

196
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,110
Murderer!

197
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,900
上周伦敦毁灭性袭击的新细节现已浮出水面

198
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,900
New details from last week's devastating attack in London have emerged.

199
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,000
更多信息 我们现在去联合情报总部……

200
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,000
For more, we go now to Joint Intelligence Headquarters...

201
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,440
刚刚证实了

202
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,440
... who released just a short while ago confirms,

203
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,970
用于伦敦袭击事件的武装无人机

204
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,970
that the deadly drones used in the London attack,

205
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,390
是斯塔克工业的产品

206
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,390
were designed by Stark Industries.

207
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,200
联邦探员 开门 联邦探员 待在这别动

208
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,200
- Federal agents! Open up! - Federal agents? You stay here!

209
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,180
灾害控制管理部

210
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,180
Department of Damage Control.

211
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,890
我们现在有张关于蜘蛛侠的逮捕令

212
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,890
We have a warrant for the arrest of Peter Parker.

213
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,230
你知道第四修正案吗 当然知道

214
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,230
- You know the fourth amendment? - Sure.

215
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,980
这是不符合情理的搜查和扣押 给我进去 伙计们 动起来

216
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,980
- Unreasonable search and seizure? - Get in here, guys. Let's go.

217
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,100
我没有杀昆廷贝克 是无人机杀的 但是那些无人机是你的

218
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,100
- I didn't kill Quentin Beck. The drones did. - The drones that are yours.

219
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,520
不 听着…

220
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,520
No... Well, look...

221
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,030
尼克弗瑞当时也一直在那儿 你们去问他 他可以解释清楚

222
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,030
Nick Fury was there the entire time. Just ask him and he can explain everything.

223
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,670
尼克弗瑞已经不在地球上一年多了

224
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,670
Nick Fury has been off-planet for the last year.

225
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,780
什么

226
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,780
What?

227
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,030
彼得

228
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,030
Peter!

229
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,530
MJ! Uhh...

230
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,270
他们跟这些事一点关系都没有

231
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,270
They had nothing to do with it, sir!

232
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,560
什么都不要说 我们请了律师 什么都不要说 我们请了律师

233
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,560
- Don't say anything, we got a lawyer. - Don't say anything, we got a lawyer.

234
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,920
我要见律师

235
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,920
I want a lawyer.

236
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,600
琼斯- 沃特森女士…

237
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,600
Miss Jones-Watson...

238
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,070
琼斯 不要加沃特森

239
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,070
Jones. I don't go by Watson.

240
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,430
琼斯女士

241
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,430
Miss Jones...

242
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,830
你为什么想找律师 如果… 如果我没什么可隐瞒的

243
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,830
- Why do you want a lawyer if... - I have nothing to hide?

244
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,900
没错 除非…除非我确实犯了什么事

245
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,900
- Exactly. Unless... - I'm actually guilty of something?

246
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,650
我可太了解你们的话术和我所拥有的司法权利了

247
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,650
I'm very aware of your tactics and my rights.

248
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,800
回答我的问题

249
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,800
Just answer my questions.

250
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,730
我看过你的档案

251
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,730
I've seen your file.

252
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,250
你比她更聪明更年轻 而且有大好前程等着你

253
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,250
You're a smart, young woman with a bright future ahead of her.

254
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,780
为什么你愿意为彼得帕克这样一个义警冒这么大的风险

255
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,780
Why would you risk it all by getting involved with a vigilante like Peter Parker?

256
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,570
很抱歉让你久等了

257
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,570
So sorry to keep you waiting.

258
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,160
能不能给奈德点零食吃 他一直在等

259
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,160
Can we get Ned a snack, please? He's been waiting.

260
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,540
老兄 我真的非常抱歉

261
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,540
Dude, I'm so sorry about that.

262
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,160
我一句话都不能跟你说

263
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,160
I'm not supposed to say anything to you.

264
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,490
不用 奈德 你什么都不用说

265
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,490
No, Ned. Not even a thing.

266
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,860
我只有一个问题

267
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,860
I just have one question...

268
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,380
当MJ告诉你彼得是蜘蛛侠的时候…

269
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,380
When MJ told you that Peter was Spider-Man...

270
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,410
喔喔喔 怎么了

271
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,410
- Whoa, whoa, whoa... - What's up?

272
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,350
我比MJ早知道太久了 我就相当于蜘蛛侠的闺中密友

273
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,350
I knew way before MJ did. I was Spider-Man's guy in the chair.

274
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,430
喔 我知道了

275
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,430
Oh, I know about those.

276
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,940
我的意思是 大多数人都有闺中密友

277
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,940
I mean, half the guys have guys in the chair.

278
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,660
没错 你绝对想不到…

279
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,660
Exactly! You wouldn't know...

280
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,000
我曾经帮他找到了秃鹫

281
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,000
I literally helped him find the Vulture.

282
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:14,850
这个我倒不知道

283
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:14,850
I didn't know that.

284
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,120
有一次我还帮他骇进他的战服 还帮他进入了太空

285
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,120
And I helped him hack his suit once, and kinda helped him get to Space.

286
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,090
所以 在蜘蛛侠的非法义警生涯中 你是他的主要同伙

287
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,090
So, in Spider-Man's illegal vigilanteism, you were his main accomplice.

288
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,520
我想把我说的话严格记录在案

289
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,520
I would like to have my words strictly from the record.

290
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,830
无意冒犯

291
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,830
With all due respect,

292
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,200
虽然我的话很不诚恳

293
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,200
and I mean that very insincerely,

294
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,260
但除非你有什么有实证的罪名要指控我们

295
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,260
unless you have some real specific charges to throw at us,

296
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,440
不然从法律上来说 你无权把我们关在这

297
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,440
legally, you can't hold us here.

298
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,560
你绝对要请个律师

299
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,560
You should definitely lawyer up.

300
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,590
你说什么

301
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,590
Excuse me?

302
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,030
危害儿童安全是件非常令人痛恨的事

303
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,030
Child endangerment is a nasty rap.

304
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,060
那个男孩相信你 作为他的法定监护人 作为一个“母亲”

305
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,060
The boy was entrusted to you, and as his legal guardian, essentially his mother,

306
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,360
你不仅允许他做伤害自己的事 你甚至还鼓励他

307
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,360
you not only allowed him to endanger himself, but you actually encouraged it.

308
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,740
哪家父母会那样做

309
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,740
Who does that?

310
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,920
我要见彼得 就现在

311
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,920
I wanna see Peter right now.

312
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,510
斯塔克工业今天卷入了有关蜘蛛侠和神秘客的争议之中

313
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,510
Stark Industries was caught in the web of the Spider-Man/Mysterio controversy today,

314
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:05,570
联邦探员开始调查失踪的斯塔克工业技术

315
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:05,570
when federal agents opened an investigation into missing Stark technology.

316
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,930
探员们想知道被拿走的到底是些什么东西

317
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,930
The agents wanna know exactly what was taken...

318
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,050
至少照片上我挺好看

319
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,050
At least they used a good picture.

320
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,580
很好 谢谢

321
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,580
That's great. Thank you.

322
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,690
我有几个好消息 彼得

323
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,690
Well, I have some good news, Peter.

324
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,200
我觉得对你的任何指控都不会成立

325
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,200
I don't believe any of the charges against you are gonna stick.

326
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,940
等等 真的吗 我就知道

327
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,940
- Wait, seriously? - Oh, I knew it.

328
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,450
我的天 默多克先生 谢谢你 太好了

329
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,450
- Oh, my God, Mr. Murdock. Thank you. - Yes.

330
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,160
谢谢你 马特 真是太棒了

331
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,160
- Thank you, Matt. - That's amazing.

332
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,090
是挺完美的 然而...

333
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,090
Well, perfect. However...

334
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,510
霍根先生 是

335
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,510
- Mister Hogan? - Yes?

336
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,180
联邦正在积极调查失踪科技

337
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,180
The feds are actively investigating the missing technology.

338
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,360
我理解你对斯塔克先生和他的遗产的忠心 但如果牵扯到你的话...

339
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,360
I understand you're loyal to Mr. Stark and his legacy, but if you were involved...

340
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,520
如果牵扯到我 你需要请个律师

341
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,520
- If I was involved? - I might secure a lawyer.

342
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,270
我想因为我正在接受调查所以我需要个律师

343
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,270
I need a lawyer because I'm un... I'm under inves... I thought,

344
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,550
你不是说没有指控了吗 那我可不可以说

345
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,550
you said, there's no charge. I could say

346
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,910
我的律师建议我拒绝回答任何问题

347
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,910
under advisement of counsel, I refuse to answer the question

348
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,870
因为...会牵连到我

349
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,870
respectfully because I... the answer could incriminate me.

350
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,410
《好家伙》里面有讲过 《好家伙》里面怎么讲的来着

351
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,410
There's a saying in Goodfellas. What did they say in Goodfellas?

352
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,970
我知道 那个确实有意思...冷静

353
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,970
I know, that's interesting... Calm down.

354
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,890
让我们先听他说 马特

355
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,890
Let's hear what he has to say. Matt?

356
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,650
你需要一个非常厉害的律师

357
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,650
You're gonna need a really good lawyer.

358
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,020
彼得 你也许逃过了司法法庭的制裁 但事情有可能会变得更糟

359
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,020
Peter, you may have dodged your legal troubles, but things will get much worse.

360
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,380
你还要接受社会舆论法庭的审判

361
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,380
There is still the court of public opinion.

362
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,410
你刚刚是怎么做到的

363
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,410
How did you just do that?

364
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,610
我是个很好的律师

365
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,610
I'm a really good lawyer.

366
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,260
我们需要找一个更安全的地方

367
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,260
We're gonna need a safer place to live.

368
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,790
报警系统已停用

369
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,790
Alarm systems, deactivated.

370
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,280
看上去不错...

371
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,280
It looks nice and....

372
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,610
而且很安全

373
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,610
safe.

374
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,070
欢迎来到精神绿洲

375
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,070
Welcome, to the spiritual oasis.

376
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,890
你喜欢大金刚二世吗

377
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,890
You like Donkey Kong Jr.?

378
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,320
噢 哈皮

379
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,320
Oh, Happy.

380
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,420
你的大学申请提交了吗

381
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,420
Did you send in your applications yet?

382
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,450
我刚刚才递交了麻省理工的申请 你呢

383
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,450
I literally just finished my MIT one. You?

384
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,080
一样 想象下如果我两个都被录取了会怎样

385
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,080
- Same. - Imagine if we both got in?

386
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,690
那奈德呢 确实 但...

387
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,690
- And Ned? - Yeah, but...

388
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,520
我们得拿奖学金才能去

389
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,520
We have to take scholarships so we could actually go.

390
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,610
得了吧 你各方面成绩都很不错 而且...

391
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,610
Come on. You got good scores, and good grades, and...

392
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,100
你觉得我太务实了 没没没 好吧...

393
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,100
- You think I'm being too pragmatic. - No, no, no, no. Well...

394
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,300
有一点 没关系

395
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,300
Kind of. That's okay.

396
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,640
那是你身上我最喜欢的一点

397
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,640
That's one of my favorite things about you.

398
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,830
真的 对

399
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,830
- Really? - Yeah.

400
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,680
那其他最喜欢的点呢

401
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,680
Well, what are your other favorite things?

402
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,420
我还喜欢你那近乎无情的乐观

403
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,420
I love your relentless optimism.

404
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,020
是的 我是那种“半瓶醋”的女孩

405
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,020
Yeah. I am a "glass half full" kind of gal.

406
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,670
我真的很喜欢你善与人打交道的性格

407
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,670
I really like how you're a people person.

408
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,970
我爱与人打交道

409
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,970
I love people.

410
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,400
真的很爱

411
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,400
Love 'em... so much.

412
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,650
你也喜欢运动

413
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,650
You like sports.

414
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,730
我觉得今年大都会队会有个好成绩

415
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,730
I think the Mets are gonna go all the way this year.

416
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,890
真的 那是什么声音

417
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,890
- Really? - What's that noise?

418
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,680
噢 是哈皮在打鼾 你看

419
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,680
Oh. That's... that's Happy. Look.

420
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,940
他把房间让给梅了 所以他在这睡

421
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,940
He gave his room to May, so he's sleeping down here.

422
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,060
我有个奇怪的问题想问你

423
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,060
I have a weird question.

424
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,870
对这一切你是否会有一点释怀的感觉

425
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,870
Does any part of you feel relieved about all of this?

426
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,400
自从我被蜘蛛咬了之后...

427
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,400
Ever since I got bit by that Spider...

428
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,440
我大概只过了一周的正常人生活

429
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,440
I've only had one week, where my life has felt normal.

430
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,890
还算正常人的生活 应该

431
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,890
Well, kind of normal, I guess.

432
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,730
然后...

433
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,730
And...

434
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,760
然后直到你发现了我的身份

435
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,760
That was when you found out.

436
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,620
因为 在我生命中我想让他们知道我身份的人

437
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,620
Because then, everyone that was in my life

438
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,840
都知道了我的身份 你懂的

439
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,840
that I wanted to know... you know.

440
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,480
就感觉很完美

441
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,480
And it was perfect.

442
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,190
但现在所有人都知道了 然后...

443
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,190
But now everybody knows. And...

444
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,450
我就成了全世界最出名的人...

445
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,450
I am the most famous person in the entire world...

446
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,970
结果我还是一贫如洗

447
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,970
... and I'm still broke.

448
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,580
我很期待明天能见到你

449
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,580
I'm... excited to see you tomorrow.

450
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,130
我也是

451
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,130
Yeah, me too.

452
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,530
差不多得了

453
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,530
Wrap it up.

454
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,820
你们都很喜欢彼此 大家都知道 把电话挂了

455
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,820
You both like each other. We get it. Hang up.

456
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,720
已经没有新的感情领域可以拓展了 好吗 我要睡了

457
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,720
There's no new ground being broken. Okay? I need my eight hours.

458
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,810
你全程都在偷听是不是

459
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,810
Have you been listening this whole time?

460
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,860
嗨 哈皮

461
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,860
Hi, Happy.

462
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,280
你当我想听啊

463
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,280
Not by choice.

464
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,320
MJ跟你问好

465
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,320
MJ says hi.

466
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,410
你好

467
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,410
Hello.

468
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:02,920
我们现在报道的是中城高中最有名的学生的高三的第一天

469
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:02,920
We're covering the first day of senior year for Midtown High's most famous student,

470
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,030
彼得帕克 去吧 老虎

471
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,030
Peter Parker! Go get 'em, Tiger!

472
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,700
或者我应该说 蜘蛛

473
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,700
Or should I say, Spider?

474
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,150
这里的人群数量还在不断地增长

475
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,150
The crowd has continued to grow here all

476
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,000
现在是中城科学学院的早晨

477
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,000
morning long at the Midtown School of Science...

478
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:19,740
人群似乎分成了两个派系 蜘蛛侠的支持者和反对者

479
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:19,740
The crowd seems evenly divided between supporters of Spider-Man, and protesters.

480

退后

485
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,030

486
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,880

490
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,830
你想知道我们之间鼓舞人心的友谊是什么样的吗?

491
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,830

Keep watching Midtown News all year as we bring you upclose and personal coverage

502
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,330
最大的一场战役：大学入学

503
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,330
of Peter fighting his biggest battle yet: college admissions.

504
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,510
彼得

505
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,510
Peter.

506
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,760
我们很高兴

507
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,760

508
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
能欢迎你回来

509
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
Welcome you back...

510
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,850
中城高中

511
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,850
To Midtown High.

512
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,940
一个塑造英雄的地方

513
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,940
Where we shape heroes.

514
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,630
嗯嗯 亦或者塑造凶手的地方

515
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,630
- Uh-huh. - Or murderers.

516
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,900
打住

517
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,900
Stop it.

518
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,050
很荣幸为你服务

519
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,050
It's an honor to serve you...

520
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,830
先生 天啊

521
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,830
- Sir. - God!

522
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,000
神秘客是对的

523
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,000
Mysterio was right.

524
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,590
打住 我们不应该.. 没什么

525
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,590
Stop. We don't... that's all.

526
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,280
一部分同学专门为你做了这个

527
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,280
Some of the students put this together for you.

528
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,770
不 是你做的

529
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,770
No. You did that.

530
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,880
你做的 我只不过帮了点小忙而已

531
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,880
- You did that. - I helped a little bit.

532
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,330
我尝试阻止他很多次了 但你居然还是做到了

533
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,330
I tried to stop him so many times, but you piled through.

534
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,710
全是他一个人做的 你干的很棒

535
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,710
- He did all of that. - You did a great job.

536
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,590
我希望你有时间能来看一下

537
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,590
I hope you have time to stop and check it out...

538
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,390
不看直接走人也行

539
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,390
And feel free to walk...

540
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,560
或者 在走廊里荡来荡去也行...爬上天花板避开人群也行

541
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,560
Or, or swing through the hallway... Or crawl on the ceiling to avoid everybody.

542
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,880
我们知道这些你都能做到

543
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,880
We all know you can do it.

544
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,950
我要...

545
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,950
I'm just gonna...

546
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:53,860
我知道你做了什么

547
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:53,860
I know what you did.

548
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,260
打住 你这是在丢自己的脸

549
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,260
Stop it. You're embarassing yourself.

550
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,040
他是个阴谋论者

551
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,040
He's a conspiracy theorist.

552
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,770
我们能不能就这样在这待一天

553
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,770
Can we just like, stay up here all day?

554
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,740
下面太疯狂了 等等 这则不错

555
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,740
- It is so crazy down there. - Wait, this one's good.

556
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,780
有人建议说

557
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,780
Some suggest that,

558
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,500
帕克拥有类似于雄性蜘蛛的

559
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,500
Parker's powers include the male spider's

560
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:21,300
催眠魅惑女性的能力

561
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:21,300
ability to hypnotize females.

562
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:24,030
就像他魅惑MJ一样

563
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:24,030
Which he used to seduce Jones-Watson

564
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,850
让MJ对他产生崇拜

565
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,850
into his cult of personality.

566
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,280
停停停

567
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,280
Stop! Stop.

568
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,470
好的 我的蜘蛛大人

569
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,470
Yes, my Spider-lord.

570
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,070
终于能有点私人空间了

571
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,070
Finally. Some privacy.

572
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,650
下面太疯狂了

573
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,650
It is so crazy down there.

574
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,460
我在想...

575
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,460
So, I was thinking...

576
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,500
等我们进了麻省理工

577
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,500
When we get into MIT,

578
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,080
我们应该同居

579
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,080
we should live together.

580
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,490
当然

581
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,490
Yeah, for sure.

582
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,520
我喜欢这个主意

583
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,520
Yeah. Love that.

584
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,870
我们也可以像这张照片里一样 对

585
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,870
- This is gonna be us. - Yes.

586
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,170
减去玩具飞碟

587
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,170
Minus the frisbee.

588
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,820
还有微笑 麻省理工很明显只是个梦

589
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,820
- And the smiling. - MIT's obviously the dream...

590
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,990
但如果我们都被备选大学录取了

591
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,990
But if we match-up our backup schools,

592
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,270
无论如何 我们都会在波士顿

593
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,270
either way, we'll all be together in Boston.

594
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,450
新学校 新城市 我可以在那里当蜘蛛侠

595
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,450
New school, new town. I can Spider-Man there.

596
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,990
波士顿也有犯罪份子的 对不对

597
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,990
I mean they have crime in Boston, right?

598
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,370
对 肯定有 是啊 邪恶的犯罪分子

599
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,370
- Yes. Yes, they do. - Yeah, wicked crime.

600
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,080
就像一个全新的人生一般

601
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,080
Yeah, so it'll be like a fresh start.

602
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,720
怎么了

603
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,720
What's up?

604
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,740
我不知道 我只是感觉

605
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,740
I don't know. I just feel like if you don't...

606
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,440
如果你对失望有所期待的话

607
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,440
If you expect disappointment,

608
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,570
那你就永远也不会失望了

609
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,570
then you can never really get disappointed.

610
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,940
Come on.

611
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,800
一定会是一个崭新的开始

612
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,800
It'll be a fresh start.

613
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,070
而且我们大家都会在一起

614
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,070
And, we'll all be together.

615
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,720
你是对的

616
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,720
Yeah. You're right.

617
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,110
新的开始

618
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,110
Fresh start.

619
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,880
新的开始

620
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,880
Fresh start.

621
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,520
第一张来了

622
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,520
First one's here!

623
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,350
还好 只是备选学校而已

624
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,350
It's okay. It's a backup school.

625
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,230
彼得

626
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,230
Peter?

627
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,760
不行

628
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,760
No?

629
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,390
最后一个

630
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,390
Last one.

631
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,940
麻省理工

632
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,940
MIT?

633
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:13,930
好吧

634
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:13,930
Okay.

635
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,590
准备好了吗 琼斯...

636
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,590
- Ready? - Jones...

637
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,800
我让你把万圣节装饰撤下来...

638
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,800
I told you to take down the Halloween decorations...

639
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,910
事实上 你是让萨沙去撤 所以...

640
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,910
Actually, that was Sasha, so...

641
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,780
给我态度好点 赶紧去做

642
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,780
Enough attitude, just do it.

643
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,040
来了

644
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,040
On it.

645
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,240
我感觉我要吐了 千万别

646
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,240
- I feel like I'm gonna puke. - Well, don't.

647
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,360
你要是吐了 拖地的人是我

648
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,360
Because, he will just make me clean it.

649
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,830
这是我们唯一的机会

650
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,830
This is our only shot.

651
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,200
成败在此一举

652
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,200
It's here, or nowhere.

653
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,350
别这样

654
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,350
Hey! Come on.

655
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,730
你们准备好了吗

656
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,730
Okay. You guys ready?

657
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,500
我数三声

658
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,500
Okay. On three.

659
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,790
一

660
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,790
One...

661
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,170
二

662
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,170
Two...

663
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,500
三

664
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,500
Three...

665
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,880
无了

666
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,880
No.

667
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,380
我也无了 你呢

668
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,380
No. You?

669
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:12,670
鉴于最近的社会争议

670
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:12,670
"In light of recent controversy, we are unable to

671
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,470
我们暂不考虑您的入学申请

672
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,470
consider your application at this time."

673
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,280
这不公平

674
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,280
This is so not fair.

675
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,980
这太不公平了 我什么也没做错

676
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,980
I mean, this is so not fair. I didn't do anything wrong.

677
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,570
而且你们更没有做错什么

678
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,570
And you guys definitely didn't do anything wrong.

679
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,800
对失望抱有期望 你就不会感到失望

680
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,800
Expect disappointment, and you will never get disappointed.

681
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,730
找到你们了

682
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,730
Busted!

683
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,390
你们没被录取

684
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,390
You guys didn't get in?

685
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,840
是啊 因为我们真的是蜘蛛侠的朋友

686
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,840
Yeah. Because we're actually friends with Spider-Man.

687
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,140
Uhh, yeah...

688
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:50,040
我得走了 我还得去见招生主任

689
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:50,040
I better get going. There's a, mixer for new admissions...

690
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,900
抱歉 伙计们

691
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,900
And... sorry, guys.

692
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,340
琼斯 你在干什么 赶紧去干活

693
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,340
Jones, what are you doing? Get back to work.

694
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,830
来了

695
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,830
Yeah. Coming.

696
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,050
你猜怎么着

697
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,050
You know what?

698
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,550
我什么都不会改变

699
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,550
I wouldn't change a thing.

700
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,420
我也是

701
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,420
Me neither.

702
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,090
但是 我还得把这封信给我爸妈看

703
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,090
Although, I coulda just showed this letter to my parents.

704
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:19,900
Umm....

705
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,070
Hi.

706
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,830
有人吗

707
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,830
Hi!

708
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,410
我是...

709
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,410
I'm...

710
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,410
世界上最没脑子的人 我知道

711
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,410
The most brainless person in the world. I know.

712
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,440
我是王 注意别滑倒了 我们可没买保险

713
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,440
Wong. Try not to slip. We don't have liability insurance.

714
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,250
你们这是在举办假日派对吗 没有

715
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,250
- Is all this for a holiday party? - No.

716
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,180
这其中一个传送门连接着西伯利亚

717
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,180
One of the rotunda gateways connects to Siberia.

718
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,230
然后雪崩了

719
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,230
Blizzard blasted through.

720
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,380
因为有人忘了施保持封印的咒语

721
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,380
Because someone forgot to cast a maintenance spell to keep the seals tight.

722
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,690
没错他确实忘了 因为他忘了我现在有更重要的职责

723
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,690
That's right. He did. Because he forgot I now have higher duties.

724
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,000
崇高的职责

725
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,000
Higher duties?

726
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,380
至尊法师都有崇高的职责 你没听错

727
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,380
The Sorcerer Supreme has high duties, yes.

728
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,130
慢着 我以为你才是至尊法师

729
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,130
Wait, I thought you were the Sorcerer Supreme?

730
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,090
不 严格意义上来说他才是

731
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,090
No. He got it on a technicality

732
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,850
因为灭霸的响指导致我失踪了五年

733
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,850
'cause I blipped for five years.

734
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,630
恭喜你

735
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,630
Oh. Well, congratulations.

736
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,970
如果我在这 我早就...

737
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,970
If I'd been here, then I'd...

738
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,310
把圣所毁的一塌糊涂了 你两个 不准偷懒

739
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,310
Burned the place down. You two, no one sits.

740
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,340
快点铲

741
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,340
Start shoveling.

742
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,650
所以 彼得

743
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,650
So, Peter...

744
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,700
我能为你做点什么

745
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,700
To what do I owe the pleasure?

746
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,090
对了

747
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,090
Right. Umm...

748
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,970
很抱歉打扰你 先生 但是...

749
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,970
I'm really sorry to bother you, sir, but...

750
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,300
拜托 我们可是一起拯救过宇宙的战友

751
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,300
Please. We saved halfthe universe together.

752
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,170
你叫我先生也太见外了

753
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,170
I think we're beyond calling me sir.

754
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,880
好吧 史蒂芬

755
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,880
Okay, uhh... Stephen.

756
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,880
听起来怪怪的 但我允了

757
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,880
That feels weird, but I'll allow it.

758
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,300
当...

759
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,300
When...

760
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,060
当神秘客揭晓了我的身份之后

761
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,060
When Mysterio revealed my identity...

762
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,680
我的人生就被搞得一团糟

763
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,680
My entire life got screwed up, and...

764
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,160
我在想 我的意思是 我不知道能不能行

765
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,160
I was wondering, I mean, I don't even know if this would actually work,

766
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,850
但是我想也许

767
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,850
but I was wondering if...

768
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:44,870
也许你可以时空回溯然后抹去他的所作所为

769
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:44,870
Maybe you could go back in time and make it so that he never did?

770
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,620
彼得

771
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,620
Peter...

772
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,760
为了复活 我们已经篡改了时空的稳定性

773
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,760
we tampered with the stability of space-time to resurrect

774
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,510
那可是无数人的生命 现在就因为你的生活被打乱了 所以你想重蹈覆辙

775
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,510
countless lives. You wanna do it again now just because yours got messy?

776
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,080
这...这不仅仅是我的事 还伤害到了许多人

777
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,080
This isn't... it's not about me. I mean, this is really hurting a lot of people.

778
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,060
我的...

779
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,060
My...

780
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,130
我的梅姨 哈皮

781
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,130
My Aunt May, Happy...

782
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,140
我的麻吉 我女朋友 他们的未来都被毁了

783
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,140
My best friend, my girlfriend, their futures

784
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,380
就因为他们知道我是蜘蛛侠 更何况

785
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,380
are ruined just because they know me, and...

786
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,170
他们什么也没做错

787
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,170
They've done nothing wrong.

788
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,380
我很抱歉 但是

789
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,380
I am so sorry, but...

790
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,430
就算我想帮你

791
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,430
even if I wanted to...

792
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,800
但我也已经没有时间宝石了

793
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,800
I don't have the Time Stone anymore.

794
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,180
也对噢

795
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,180
That's right.

796
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,310
如果我耽误了你的时间

797
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,310
I'm really sorry if I...

798
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,470
我很抱歉

799
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,470
wasted your time.

800
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,500
你没有... 那就算了吧

801
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,500
-You didn't... - Just forget about it.

802
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,510
他会的 他确实很擅长忘记某些事情

803
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,510
He will. He's really good at forgetting things.

804
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,790
王 你给了我很大的启发

805
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,790
Wong. You've actually generated a good idea.

806
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,800
什么

807
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,800
What?

808
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,070
卡夫卡符文

809
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,070
The runes of Cafkal.

810
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,090
卡夫卡的符文

811
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,090
The runes of Cafkal.

812
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,120
噢 只是一个再普通不过的遗忘咒罢了

813
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,120
Oh, it's just a standard spell of forgetting.

814
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,580
虽然没法时空回溯 但至少人们会忘记你曾是蜘蛛侠的事实

815
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,580
Won't turn back time, but at least people will forget that you were ever Spider-Man.

816
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,490
你确定吗 不 我不太确定

817
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,490
- Seriously? - No. Not seriously.

818
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,910
这个咒语穿梭于已知与未知的现实之间的黑暗边界

819
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,910
That spell travels the dark borders between known and unknown reality.

820
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,440
太危险了

821
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,440
It's too dangerous.

822
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,720
天啊 我们已经基本不用这个咒语了

823
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,720
God, we've used it for a lot less.

824
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,460
你还记不记得卡玛泰姬的满月派对

825
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,460
Do you remember the full moon party in Kamar-Taj?

826
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,120
不记得 那不就对了

827
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,120
- No. - Exactly.

828
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,950
Come on. Wong.

829
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,370
你还嫌他经历的不够多吗

830
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,370
Hasn't he been through enough?

831
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,070
反正别把我扯进来就行了

832
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,070
Just leave me out of this.

833
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,750
行

834
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,750
Fine.

835
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,110
行

836
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,110
Fine.

837
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,530
所以这是什么地方

838
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,530
So what is this place?

839
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,270
至圣所建立在宇宙能量流的交汇之处

840
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,270
The Sanctum's built at the intersection of cosmic energy currents.

841
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,190
我们是第一批找寻宇宙能量之人

842
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,190
We were the first to seek them out.

843
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,300
这些墙壁已经有近千年的历史了

844
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,300
Some of these walls are thousands of years old.

845
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,720
80年代还有人来这拍了集《伸冤人》

846
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,720
And they shot an episode of Equalizer here in the 80's.

847
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,980
Well, I, umm...

848
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,020
我真的很感谢你为我所做的一切 先生

849
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,020
really appreciate you doing this for me, sir.

850
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,510
小事不值一提

851
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,510
Don't mention it.

852
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,550
不要叫我先生

853
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,550
And don't call me sir.

854
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,100
对 抱歉

855
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,100
Right. Sorry.

856
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,520
你准备好了吗

857
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,520
You ready?

858
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:03,880
准备好了

859
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:03,880
I'm ready.

860
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,880
很高兴认识你 蜘蛛侠

861
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,880
Nice knowing you, Spider-Man.

862
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,630
等等 你说什么

863
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,630
Wait, excuse me?

864
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,550
整个世界都将忘记彼得帕克是蜘蛛侠这件事

865
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,550
The entire world is about to forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.

866
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,800
包括我 所有人

867
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,800
- Including me. - Everyone?

868
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,500
就不能留一些人知道 咒语可做不到这一点

869
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,500
- Can't some people still know? - That's not how the spell works.

870
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,960
在施法过程中改变咒语是非常困难和危险的

871
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,960
Very difficult and dangerous to change it mid-casting.

872
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,970
所以我的女朋友会忘记我们所经历的一切

873
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,970
So my girlfriend is just gonna forget about everything we've

874
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,000
那事毕之后她还是不是我女朋友

875
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,000
been through? I mean, is she even gonna be my girlfriend?

876
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,340
看情况 取决于她是因为你是蜘蛛侠才做你女朋友 还是...

877
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,340
That depends. Was she your girlfriend just because you're Spider-Man, or...

878
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,920
我不知道 我希望不是

879
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,920
I don't know. I really hope not.

880
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,090
好吧

881
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,090
Alright. Fine.

882
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,690
世界上的每个人都将忘记你是蜘蛛侠

883
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,690
Everyone in the world is gonna forget you're Spider-Man,

884
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,410
除了你女朋友

885
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,410
except your girlfriend.

886
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:46,840
太感谢了 我的天 奈德

887
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:46,840
Thank you so much.... Oh, my God. Ned.

888
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,200
奈德 奈德是个什么东西

889
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,200
- Ned! - What is a Ned?

890
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,290
他是我最好的朋友 他知不知道对我来说很重要

891
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,290
He's my best friend so it's really important to me that Ned knows.

892
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,930
好吧 我要施咒了 从现在开始不要改来改去了

893
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,930
Okay. Let's not change the parameters of the spell anymore...

894
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,230
好的 没别的了 我发誓没别的了

895
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,230
- While I'm casting it. - Okay, I'm done. I swear I'm done.

896
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,300
但我的梅姨总该知道吧

897
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,300
But my Aunt May should really know.

898
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,120
彼得 不要干扰我施法

899
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,120
Peter, stop tampering with the spell.

900
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,940
自从她知道我是蜘蛛侠以后 那可真的是一团糟

901
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,940
Once she found out that I was Spider-Man, it was really messy, and

902
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,710
我不觉得我想再经历一次了

903
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,710
I don't think that I can go through with that again.

904
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,560
所以 梅姨可以吗 可以

905
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,560
- So, my Aunt May? - Yes!

906
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,400
噢 谢谢 你开心吗 不 我快烦死了

907
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,400
- Oh, thank you. Happy? - No. I am annoyed.

908
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,440
不 这是个昵称 哈罗德哈皮霍根

909
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,440
No, it's a nickname. Harold "Happy" Hogan.

910
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,020
他以前为托尼斯塔克工作

911
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,020
He used to work for Tony Stark....

912
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,570
您能不能不要再碎碎念了

913
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,570
Could you just stop talking?

914
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,390
其实 以前就知道我是蜘蛛侠的人现在也应该继续知道

915
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,390
Basically, everyone who knew that I was Spider-Man before, should still know.

916
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,720
成功了吗 没有

917
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,720
- Did it work? - No.

918
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,340
我的咒语被你改变了整整六次 五次

919
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,340
- You changed my spell six times. - Five times.

920
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,020
你改了我的咒语 我告诉你 不要那样做

921
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,020
You changed my spell. You don't do that. I told you,

922
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,670
这就是原因

923
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,670
and that is why.

924
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,760
如果我没有及时打住的话 那个咒语就完完全全失控了

925
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,760
That spell was completely out of control. If I hadn't shut it down,

926
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,910
有可能会发生什么灾难性的事情

927
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,910
something catastrophic could've happened.

928
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,240
史蒂芬 我真的很抱歉

929
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,240
Stephen, listen, I am so sorry...

930
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,730
叫我先生

931
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,730
Call me sir.

932
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,290
对不起 先生

933
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,290
Sorry, sir.

934
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:24,230
你知道吗 即使在我们经历了那么多事情以后

935
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:24,230
You know, after everything we've been through together, somehow I always forget...

936
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,010
我还是会忘记你只是个孩子

937
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,010
You're just a kid.

938
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,320
听着 很大一部分的问题

939
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,320
Look, part of the problem,

940
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,830
并不在神秘客身上

941
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,830
it's not Mysterio.

942
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,340
而是在你自己身上 你想过两种不同的人生

943
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,340
It's you. Trying to live two different lives.

944
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,680
你越这么想越这么做 就越危险 相信我

945
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,680
And the longer you do that, the more dangerous it becomes. Believe me.

946
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,600
我真的很同情你和你的朋友没法进入大学

947
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,600
I'm so sorry about, you and your friends,

948
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:42,470
如果他们拒绝了你

949
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:42,470
not getting into college, but if they rejected you, and...

950
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,620
你就去说服他们 这是你唯一能做的事情

951
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,620
you try to convince them to reconsider, there is nothing else you can do.

952
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,580
你说“说服他们”

953
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,580
When you say "convince them",

954
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,010
你的意思是 让我给他们打电话

955
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,010
you mean like, I could've called them?

956
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,960
是的

957
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,960
Yeah.

958
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,850
可以吗

959
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,850
I can do that?

960
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,690
你没打过是不是

961
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,690
You haven't called?

962
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,980
我 我收到了来信 我以为

963
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,980
Well, I mean, I got their letter, and I assumed that...

964
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,680
等等 你是在跟我说

965
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,680
I'm sorry, but are you telling me,

966
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,240
在你来找我 让我洗脑全世界之前

967
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,240
that you didn't even think to plead your case with them first,

968
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,550
你都还没有找校方谈过这个问题

969
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,550
before you asked me to

970
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,240
是不是

971
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,240
brainwash the entire world?

972
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,670
当你在和我同样处境的时候...

979
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:29,910
Why?

980
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,310
因为我需要找麻省理工的人谈谈

981
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,310
Because, I need to come and talk to someone. I'm

我光跟你打电话就已经冒了很大的风险了

987
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,550
I'm risking a lot just talking to you.

1029
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,200
MJ沃特森和奈德利兹是我这辈子遇到过的最聪明的两个人

1030
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,200
MJ Watson and Ned Leeds are the two smartest people I've ever met in my entire life,

1031
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,220
而我则是个大傻瓜 因为...

1032
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,220
and I'm the dumbest person, because....

我让他们帮我 但如果我不让他们帮我的话

1034
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,690
I let them help me, but if I didn't let them help

1035
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,590
好几百万人都会死 所以拜托...

1036
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,590
me, then millions of people would've died, so please...

1037
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,310
不要让麻省理工变得和我一样傻瓜 麻省理工傻瓜

1038
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,310
- Don't let MIT be dumb like me. - MIT is dumb?

1039
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,980
没有 我没说麻省理工傻瓜

1040
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,980
No! I'm saying don't let MIT be dumb.

1041
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,410
我的意思是

1042
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,410
I mean, like the...

1043
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,230
那个不让他们帮忙的

1044
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,230
the dumber version of me that

1045
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,040
那个傻瓜的我

1046
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,040
wouldn't have let them help.

1047
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,470
你这份说辞是不是没事先排练过 彼得

1048
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,470
You didn't rehearse that, did you, Peter?

1049
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,670
总之 我想说的是...

1050
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,670
Basically, what I'm trying to...

1051
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,070
你跑什么 什么...

1052
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,070
Why are you running? What...

1053
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,490
我的老天爷 女士 你最好赶紧从车里出来

1054
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,490
Oh, my God. Ma'am? You should get out of the car.

1055
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,500
所有人离开大桥

1056
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,500
Everybody get off the bridge!

1057
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,180
我们被锁住了 这门

1058
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,180
We're locked. Doors --- hey!

1059
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,010

你好

1062
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,530
Hi?

1063
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,680
我们...我认识你吗 你对我的机器做了什么

1064
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,680
- Have we... Do I know you? - What have you done with my machine?

1065
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,750
Your ma...

1066
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,740
我根本不知道你在说什么 什么机器

1067
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,740
I don't know what you're talking about. What machine?

1068
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,190
我掌中的太阳能量 没了

1069
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,190
The power of the sun, in the palm of my hand. It's gone.

1070
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,360
听着 先生 能不能先不要砸车了

1071
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,360
Listen, sir. If you stop smashing cars,

1072
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:36,160
我们可以合作 找回你的机器

1073
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:36,160
we could work together and I can help you find your machine.

1074
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,990
你是不是想耍我

1075
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,990
You wanna play games?

1076
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,010

1079
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,850
It's okay. You guys are fine, you're safe. Get out of here.

1080
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,790
你觉得你那花哨的新战服能救得了你

1081
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,790
You think your fancy new suit's gonna save you?

1082
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,510
当时我就应该杀了你的小女朋友

1083
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,510
I should've killed your little girlfriend when I had the chance.

1084
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,280
你刚刚说什么

1085
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,280
What did you just say?

1086
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,700
看来我们有竞争对手了

1087
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,700
Looks like we got competition.

1088
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,690

Ma'am, just stay calm.

1096
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,630
深呼吸 你还好吗 不

1097
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,630
- Just take a deep breath. Are you okay? - No!

1098
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,530
一切尽在掌控之中

1099
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,530
I've got it all under control.

1100
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,140
战服损毁

1101
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,140
Suit compromised.

1102
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,120
纳米科技

1103
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,120
Nanotechnology.

1104
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:09,410
你比我想象的还要厉害 彼得

1105
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:09,410
You've outdone yourself, Peter.

1106
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,070
我低估你了

1107
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,070
I underestimated you.

1108
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,580
但现在 你死定了

1109
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,580
But now, you die.

1110
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,790
你不是彼得帕克

1111
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,790
You're not Peter Parker.

1112
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,000
我现在有点混乱

1113
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,000
I am so confused right now.

1114
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,190
发生什么了 检测到新设备

1115
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,190
- What's happening? - New device detected.

00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,880

1117

Pairing new device.

1118
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:55,270
不要听他的 听我的

1119
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:55,270
Don't listen to him, you listen to me.

1120
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,090
Hey.

1121

你还好吗女士 快 也许还能赶上飞机

1126
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,520

你是个英雄

1130
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,440
You're a hero.

1131
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,590

No, I'm...

1135
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,250
我会去跟招生处聊聊你的朋友

1136
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,250
I'm gonna talk to admissions about your friends,

1137
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,500
我还要跟他们聊聊你

1138
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,500
and I'm gonna talk to them about you.

1139
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,450
不 女士 这和我没关系

1140
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,450
No, but, Ma'am, this isn't about me.

1141
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:49,220
我要跟他们聊聊关于你的朋友和你

1142
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:49,220
I'm going to talk to them about your friends, and you.

1143
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,070
好吗 真的

1144
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,070
- Okay? - Really?

1145
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,660
而且如果你别再做啥坏事的话

1146
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,660
And if you keep your noses clean,

1147
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,300
也许你也有机会进麻省

1148
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,300
maybe you'll have a fair shot.

1149
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,730
让开我 让我去找那个人

1150
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,730
Here. Get out of the way. Let me get that man.

1151
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,980
你 我看见你了

1152
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,980
You. I see you.

1153
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,080
给我过来

1154
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,080
Come here!

1155
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,220
这一点也不好

1156
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,220
That was not okay.

1157
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,380
不可理喻

1158
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,380
Unbelievable.

1159
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,980
在你不再想杀我之前

1160
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,980
Until you stop trying to kill me,

1161
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,430
你都受我控制 伙计

1162
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,430
I'm in control, buddy.

1163
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:11,210
我控制着你背后的那些触手

1164
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:11,210
Of this whole tentacle situation you got going on here.

1165
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:14,820
懂了吗 现在告诉我你是谁 什么情况...

1166
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:14,820
Okay? Now, who are you? What is going on...

1167
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,000
奥斯本

1168
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,000
Osborn?

1169
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:56,390
博士...

1170
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:56,390
Doctor...

1171
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,370
小心你自己许的愿 帕克

1172
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,370
Be careful what you wish for, Parker.

1173
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,110
让我出去

1174
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,110
Let me out of here!

1175
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,390
你能给我解释下发生什么了吗

1176
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,390
Can you please explain to me what is going on?

1177
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,270
你搞砸的那个咒语

1178
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,270
That little spell that you botched where you wanted everyone to forget

1179
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,590
那个想让所有人忘记彼得帕克是蜘蛛侠的咒语

1180
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,590
that Peter Parker is Spider-Man, it started pulling in everyone who knows

1181
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:22,090
正在开始把每个宇宙知道蜘蛛侠是彼得帕克的人全拖进来

1182
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:22,090
Peter Parker is Spider-Man, from every universe.

1183
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:24,930
每个宇宙

1184
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:24,930
From every universe?

1185
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,610
你是谁 我在哪儿

1186
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,610
Who are you? Where am I?

1187
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,150
我觉得我们最好不要跟他接触

1188
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,150
I think it's better if we don't with him because, frankly,

1189
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,450
因为老实说 多元宇宙是一个

1190
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,450
the Multiverse is a concept about which we know

1191
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,130
我们知之甚少的概念

1192
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,130
frighteningly little.

1193
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,380
多元宇宙是真的

1194
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,380
The multiverse is real.

1195
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,130
这根本不可能

1196
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,130
This shouldn't even be possible.

1197
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,160
但我以为你不是叫停了那个咒语么

1198
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,160
But I thought you stopped the spell?

1199
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,600
确实 我控制住了 但还是有几只漏网之鱼

1200
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,600
No, I contained it, but it would appear that a few of them squeaked through.

1201
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,050
自从你走后 我开始感知到一些来自其他宇宙的存在

1202
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,050
After you left, I detected an otherworldly presence.

1203
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:50,890
于是我追到了下水道 找到了这个黏糊糊绿油油的家伙

1204
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:50,890
I pursued it into the sewers, where I found that slimy, green, son of a gun.

1205
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,450
咒语

1206
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,450
Spell?

1207
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,780
是魔法吗

1208
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,780
Is it magic?

1209
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,830
这是什么意思 生日派对

1210
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,830
What is this, a birthday party?

1211
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,310
这个小丑是谁

1212
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,310
Who is this clown?

1213
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:58,780
这到底是怎么回事儿

1214
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:58,780
What is this madness?

1215
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:02,040
看好了 你知道彼得帕克是蜘蛛侠吗

1216
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:02,040
Watch this. Do you know a Peter Parker who is Spider-Man?

1217
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:02,880
知道

1218
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:02,880
Yes.

1219
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,550
是他吗 不是

1220
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,550
- Is that him? - No.

1221
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,510
看见没有

1222
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,510
See?

1223
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,290
好吧 接下来我们这么做

1224
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,290
Okay, here's what we gotta do.

1225
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,750
我不知道接下来我们还要面对

1226
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,750
I don't know how many of these

1227
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,770
多少个这样的访客 我有看见过一个

1228
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,770
- visitors we got... - I saw another one.

1229
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,200
在大桥上

1230
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,200
On the bridge.

1231
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,630
他就像

1232
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,630
He was like a...

1233
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,650
一只飞着的绿妖精

1234
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,650
Like a flying green elf.

1235
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,880
听起来有意思 你为什么不从他开始着手

1236
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,880
Well he sounds jolly. Why don't you start with him?

1237
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,840
在他们摧毁我们的现实之前

1238
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,840
I need you to capture them and bring them here,

1239
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:23,210
我需要你把他们抓回来这里

1240
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:23,210
while I figure out how to get them back.

1241
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,060
而我留在这思考如何把他们送回去 更重要的是

1242
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,060
Before they destroy the fabric of reality, or worse,

1243
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,290
不要被王发现

1244
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,290
Wong finds out.

1245
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,040
奇异博士

1246
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,040
Uhh, Doctor Strange?

1247
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,620
什么

1248
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,620
What?

1249
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:34,160
我的朋友刚刚获得第二次进入麻省理工的机会

1250
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:34,160
My friends and I just got a second chance at getting into MIT.

1251
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,930
要是被学校看见我和这些疯怪物打架的话

1252
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,930
If the school sees me fighting these...

1253
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,150
嘿 积点口德

1254
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,150
- crazy monsters, - Hey, watch your mouth!

1255
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,190
抱歉 现在是跟我聊大学入学的合适时机吗

1256
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,190
- I'm sorry. - You're seriously still talking about college?

1257
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:48,370
你刚刚在干什么

1258
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:48,370
Hey, what did you just do?

1259
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,290
这个

1260
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,290
This.

1261
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,580
你是怎么做到的

1262
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,580
How did you do that?

1263
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,110
好多生日派对

1264
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,110
Lots of birthday parties.

1265
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,410
Hey!

1266
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,370
只需一发 就可以把他们送来这儿 不用谢

1267
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,370
One shot, send it to me and move on. You're welcome.

1268
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,410
开始干活吧

1269
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,410
Get to work.

1270
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,510
先生

1271
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,510
Sir?

1272
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,940
又咋了

1273
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,940
Now what?

1274
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,980
我知道这是我捅的篓子 所以我向你保证

1275
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,980
I know this is my mess, and I swear to you

1276
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,720
我会解决这一切的 但我需要点帮助

1277
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,720
that I'll fix it, but I'm gonna need some help.

1278
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,980
我不敢相信我居然在至圣所里

1279
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,980
I can't believe I'm in the Sanctum Sanctorum.

1280
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,330
我也是

1281
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,330
Neither can I.

1282
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,680
So...

1283
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:32,370
你是怎么知道你有魔法天赋的 因为我奶奶说我们有时候

1284
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:32,370
How did you know you're made of magic? Because my nanna says that we have it in

1285
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,450
可以在手上变出点叮铃铃的东西

1286
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,450
and sometimes I get these tinglings in my hand...

1287
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,010
你该去看精神科医生了

1288
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,010
You should talk to your physician.

1289
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:36,860
彼得

1290
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:36,860
Peter!

1291
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:37,920
- Hey! - Hey.

1292
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,160
我很抱歉又把你们扯进来 你们得帮我找到这几个人

1293
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,160
I'm so sorry for dragging you in this, you just gotta help me find these guys...

1294
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,300
没必要道歉 你帮我们争取到了麻省理工的第二次机会

1295
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,300
You don't have to apologize. You got us a second shot at MIT.

1296
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,700
所以那些坏人是怎么来到我们世界的

1297
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,700
So, how did the bad guys get here?

1298
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,310
为了把你们搞进大学 他搞砸了一个符咒

1299
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,310
He screwed up a spell trying to get you into college.

1300
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,460
等等 什么 我以为是魔法镭射 你会使魔法了

1301
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,460
- Wait, what? I thought it was a magic laser? - You did it with magic?

1302
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,880
不 那是之后的事了 我们先专注于好消息 好吗

1303
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,880
No, that was after. Let's just focus on the good news, okay?

1304
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,710
不 我们先专注于坏消息

1305
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,710
No, let's just focus on the bad news.

1306
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,460
目前来说

1307
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,460
As of now, you have detected

1308
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,420
探测到了0个多元闯入者 所以

1309
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,420
zero multiversal trespassers, so...

1310
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,800
去拿你的手机

1311
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,800
Get on your phones,

1312
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,700
搜索互联网 然后

1313
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,700
scour the internet, and...

1314
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,080
解决这档子破事

1315
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,080
Scooby-Doo this shit!

1316
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,250
你在这里指点江山

1317
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,250
You're telling us what to do,

1318
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,760
可明明就是你的咒语

1319
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,760
even though it was your spell,

1320
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:16,630
是你搞砸了这一切 这是你的烂摊子

1321
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:16,630
that got screwed up. Meaning that all of this is kind of your mess.

1322
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,870
你知道吗

1323
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,870
You know, I know

1324
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:21,380
其实我自己也懂一两个咒语 但都是以“请”开头的

1325
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:21,380
a couple of magic words myself, starting with the word 'please'.

1326
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:27,150
请你们 解决这档子破事

1327
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:27,150
Please, Scooby-Doo this shit.

1328
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,380
你们可以在地下室工作

1329
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,380
You can work in the undercroft.

1330
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,640
地下室

1331
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,640
The undercroft?

1332
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,340
酷毙了

1333
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,340
Badass.

1334
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,440
伙计们 听着 这个咒语...

1335
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,440
Guys, listen. About this whole spell thing...

1336
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:48,090
没什么大不了的

1337
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:48,090
It's totally okay.

1338
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,800
真的吗

1339
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,800
- Wait, really? - Yeah.

1340
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,500
我都懂 你只是想...

1341
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,500
I mean, I get it. You were...

1342
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,740
拨乱反正...

1343
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,740
just trying to fix things...

1344
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,180
所以...

1345
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,180
And so...

1346
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,920
下次记得提前通知我们一声

1347
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,920
Maybe just run it by us next time, you know?

1348
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,970
因为当你想干点打破宇宙维度之类的事情的时候

1349
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,970
That way, when you're thinking, "Hey, I'm about to do something that could...

1350
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,720
我们可以帮你

1351
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,720
break the universe", we could like, help you.

1352
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,530
帮你改造装备之类的 或者

1353
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,530
Workshop something, or...

1354
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,970
帮你出主意

1355
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,970
brainstorm ideas.

1356
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,010
成交

1357
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,010
Deal.

1358
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,450
奈德

1359
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,450
Ned?

1360
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,410
伙计 我才不在乎 说实话 没什么大不了的

1361
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,410
Oh, dude. I don't care. And seriously, not a big deal.

1362
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,320
刑架

1363
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,320
A torture rack.

1364
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,940
那个是普拉提瑜伽机

1365
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,940
That is a pilates machine.

1366
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,120
这个是... 地窖

1367
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,120
- That is... - The crypt.

1368
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,220
好了 现在我们找到剩下的人

1369
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,220
Okay, so we get the rest of the guys.

1370
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,390
你网住他们 魔法博士送他们回去

1371
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,390
You zap them, Doctor Magic will send them back.

1372
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,210
然后我们进麻省理工

1373
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,210
And when we get into MIT,

1374
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,360
谁要吃甜甜圈 我请客

1375
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,360
round of stale donuts, my treat.

1376
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,280
让我们来抓点多元宇宙的人吧

1377
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,280
Let's catch some multiverse men.

1378
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,150
这两个家伙是谁

1379
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,150
Hey! Who the hell are these two?

1380
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,900
我的朋友 MJ和奈德

1381
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,900
These are my friends. This is MJ and this is Ned.

1382
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,050
你好

1383
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,050
Hello.

1384
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,870
抱歉 你叫啥来着

1385
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,870
I'm sorry, what was your name again?

1386
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,960
奥托 奥克塔维思博士

1387
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,960
Dr. Otto Octavius.

1388
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,460
开玩笑吧 你的真名是什么

1389
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,460
Wait, no seriously, what's your actual name?

1390
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,320
那是只恐龙吗

1391
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,320
Oh, is that a dinosaur?

1392
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,450
不不不 不可能

1393
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,450
No, no, no, May.

1394
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,580
我们得先找到这些人

1395
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,580
We gotta find these guys first.

1396
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,420
快去完成你的任务 然后再回来

1397
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,420
Well, finish your mission, then come by.

1398
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,740
我找到了

1399
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,740
I got one, I got one, I got one.

1400
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,600
梅 我得走了 好 爱你 再见

1401
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,600
- Oh, May? I gotta go. - Okay. Love you. Bye.

1402
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,110
你可以把人从椅子上拉起来

1403
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,110
I mean you can take the guy out of the chair

1404
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,240
但你没法把椅子从人身上拉出来

1405
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,240
but you can't take\ the chair out of the guy.

1406
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,740
你找到什么了

1407
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,740
What did you find?

1408
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:39,860
有个...

1409
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:39,860
There's a...

1410
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,790
城外一处军事研究设施附近发生了骚乱

1411
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,790
disturbance near a military research facility outside of the city.

1412
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,570
有目击者声称看见一个怪物在天上飞

1413
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,570
And witnesses say they saw a monster flying through the air.

1414
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:51,120
肯定是我在大桥上看见的那个人

1415
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:51,120
That's gotta be the guy I saw on the bridge, right?

1416
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,610
不可能

1417
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,610
That's impossible.

1418
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:56,390
你是不是认识他

1419
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:56,390
You know him, don't you?

1420
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,420
在桥上的时候你叫了他的名字

1421
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,420
On the bridge, you said his name.

1422
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,200
诺曼奥斯本

1423
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,200
Norman Osborn.

1424
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,430
天才科学家

1425
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,430
Brilliant scientist.

1426
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,260
军工科学家

1427
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,260
Military researcher.

1428
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:08,830
但他太贪婪了

1429
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:08,830
But he was greedy.

1430
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,290
走错了路

1431
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,290
Misguided.

1432
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,530
他怎么了 我们已经受够了你那没完没了的问题了

1433
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,530
- What happened to him? - We tire of your questions, boy!

1434
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,000
Okay...

1435
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,950
我得走了 我们要去哪儿

1436
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,950
I gotta go. Where are we going?

1437
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,560
不可能是他

1438
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,560
It can't be him.

1439
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,510
为什么

1440
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,510
Why?

1441
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,760
因为诺曼奥斯本一年前就死了

1442
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,760
Because Norman Osborn died years ago.

1443
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,740
所以这个要么是其他东西

1444
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,740
So either we saw someone else,

1445
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:38,170
要么就是鬼魂

1446
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:38,170
or you're flying out into the darkness, to fight a ghost.

1447
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:04,400
盯紧那些树 我们还不知道那个人在哪儿

1448
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:04,400
Keep an eye out on those trees, we don't really know where this guy is.

1449
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,960
我真不知道你是怎么在这种情况下还能不吐的

1450
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,960
I really don't know how you do this without throwing up.

1451
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,690
你们看见了吗

1452
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,690
Did you guys see that?

1453
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:31,730
没有

1454
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:31,730
No.

1455
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:33,340
这里真的超级黑

1456
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:33,340
It's, it's really dark.

1457
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,320
发生什么了

1458
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,320
What's happening?

1459
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,750
彼得 怎么了

1460
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,750
Peter, what is it?

1461
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,300
是你的蜘蛛感应

1462
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,300
Are you getting the tingle thing?

1463
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,610
蜘蛛感应起作用了 是不是

1464
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,610
Is the tingle thing happening? Is your tingle tingling?

1465
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:13,210
你们看见了吗

1466
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:13,210
Are you guys seeing this?

1467
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:15,390
看见了 奥斯本

1468
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:15,390
- Yeah. - Osborn?

1469
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,350
不 他是绿的 这家伙是蓝的

1470
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,350
No. He was green. This guy's blue.

1471
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:21,620
你不会碰巧是从其他宇宙来的吧

1472
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:21,620
You wouldn't happen to be from another universe, would you?

1473
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,680
他在干嘛

1474
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,680
What's he doing?

1475
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,470
我不知道 看上去像是在充电

1476
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,470
I don't know. Looks like he's charging.

1477
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:27,390
我不喜欢这样 快网住他

1478
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:27,390
I don't like this. Just web him.

1479
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,650
往左 往左

1480
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,650
Go left, left! Go left!

1481
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,690
等等 右 右

1482
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,690
Wait! Right, right!

1483
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:48,860
伙计们

1484
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:48,860
Guys!

1485
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,960
你们根本没在帮忙

1486
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,960
This is not helping!

1487
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,240
不不不 发生什么了

1488
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,240
No, no, no. What happened?

1489
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,550
彼得 彼得

1490
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,550
Peter? Peter?

1491
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:09,310
Whoa.

1492
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,710
彼得 是我 弗林特马可 你还记得吗

1493
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,710
Peter, it's me. Flint Marko. You remember?

1494
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,420
我是彼得 但我不是你宇宙的那个彼得

1495
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,420
I'm Peter, but I'm not your Peter.

1496
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:18,530
你不是我宇宙的彼得 什么意思

1497
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:18,530
What do you mean you're not my Peter? What the hell is going on?

1498
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:21,250
我会解释的 但首先你能不能先帮我阻止这家伙

1499
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:21,250
I'll explain everything, but first can you help me stop this guy?

1500
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:22,190
Okay.

1501
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,380
你试着包围他 然后我去拔插头

1502
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,380
You try to surround him and I'll pull the plug.

1503
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,950
好 我们上吧

1504
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,950
All right, let's go.

1505
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:42,500
我没办法拖住他很久

1506
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:42,500
I can't hold him much longer.

1507
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:44,850
我抓住了

1508
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:44,850
I got him. I got it.

1509
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,450
不同的彼得 真奇怪

1510
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,450
Different Peter. Weird.

1511
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,690
谢谢

1512
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,690
Thanks.

1513
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,060
抱歉

1514
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,060
Sorry.

1515
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,310
别担心

1516
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,310
Don't worry about it.

1517
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:27,930
我的肉身居然回来了

1518
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:27,930
I got my body back.

1519
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,700
Hey, umm...

1520
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,730
这听起来会很扯 但你现在所处的不是你那个的宇宙

1521
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,730
This is gonna sound really crazy, but this isn't your universe.

1522
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,330
另一个宇宙

1523
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,330
Another universe?

1524
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,030
什么 我刚刚就有这种感觉

1525
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,030
- What? - That's what I was feeling.

1526
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:40,820
力量 截然不同的力量

1527
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:40,820
The power. It's different.

1528
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,380
我挺喜欢

1529
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,380
I like it.

1530
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,270
放轻松 伙计

1531
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,270
Easy, buddy.

1532
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,490
你们来到这儿事实上是我的错

1533
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,490
It's actually my fault that you're here.

1534
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,600
来到这宇宙 还是树林

1535
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,600
Like the universe? Or the woods?

1536
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:55,750
我讨厌树林 我说的是宇宙 先生

1537
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:55,750
- I hate the woods. - I meant the universe, sir.

1538
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:59,250
所以 你们就打算站在那里 假装没看见我光着屁股吗?

1539
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:59,250
So what? You guys just gonna stand there and act like I ain't butt-ass naked?

1540
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:01,460
没错 啊 没有

1541
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:01,460
- I am. - Uhh, no, no...

1542
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:17,250
那是什么 你刚刚对他做了什么

1543
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:17,250
What was that? What did you just do to him?

1544
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,390
没事的 放心

1545
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,390
No, no, no. It's okay.

1546
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:19,440
你刚刚是不是把他杀了

1547
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:19,440
Did you kill him?

1548
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,820
听着 我可以解释所有事 但请你得先相信我

1549
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,820
Whoa, listen. I can explain everything. You just have to trust me, please.

1550
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,520
我不相信你 我又不认识你

1551
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,520
I don't trust you. I don't know you.

1552
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,860
这是什么

1553
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,860
What is this?

1554
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:31,450
你站错队了

1555
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:31,450
You picked the wrong side.

1556
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:35,080
康纳斯

1557
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:35,080
Connors?

1558
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:37,870
什么

1559
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:37,870
What?

1560
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:39,370
你认识这个生物

1561
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:39,370
You know this creature?

1562
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,070
不不不 他不是生物 他是人

1563
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,070
No, no, no, no. Not a creature. A man.

1564
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:44,570
我们来自同一宇宙

1565
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:44,570
From same universes.

1566
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:48,920
柯特康纳斯博士 我在奥斯本企业上班的时候他是那儿的一名科学家

1567
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:48,920
Dr. Curt Connors. He was a scientist in Oscorp when I worked there.

1568
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,380
一名出色的科学家

1569
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,380
A brilliant scientist.

1570
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,020
直到他把自己变成了一只大蜥蜴

1571
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,020
Till he turned himself into a lizard. Then he tried

1572
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:55,580
他甚至还想把全城人都变成蜥蜴 真是疯了

1573
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:55,580
to turn the whole city into lizards. It was crazy.

1574
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:59,050
我没有疯 麦克斯 这是人类进化的必要过程

1575
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:59,050
It wasn't crazy, Max. It was the next step in human evolution.

1576
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:00,670
恐龙居然讲话了

1577
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:00,670
The dinosaur can talk.

1578
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,480
蜥蜴 好吧

1579
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,480
- Lizard. - Right.

1580
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,390
话说回来 你是什么情况

1581
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,390
Speaking of which, what happened to you? Last I

1582
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:06,680
我记得你以前是个烂牙齿 戴眼镜的谢顶男

1583
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:06,680
recall, you had bad teeth, glasses and a comb-over.

1584
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,040
你是不是整容了

1585
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,040
Did you get a makeover?

1586
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:12,320
你知道我可以给你整一个真正的容

1587
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:12,320
You know I can give you a real makeover.

1588
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,620
让我猜猜 整成一只蜥蜴 没错- Let me guess. Into a lizard?

1589
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,620
- Exactly.

1590
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,460
你们俩能不能消停会 我们这是在哪儿

1591
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,460
Could you two just shut up? Where are we?

1592
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:19,230
一言难尽 一个巫师的地牢

1593
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:19,230
- It's complicated. - A wizard's dungeon.

1594
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,010
巫师...巫师的地牢

1595
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,010
Wizard's... Wizard's dungeon?

1596
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:22,670
没什么好掩饰的

1597
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:22,670
There's no real way to sugarcoat that.

1598
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,630
这就是巫师的地牢

1599
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,630
It's literally the dungeon of a wizard.

1600
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,240
听着 你可以留着你的魔法

1601
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,240
Look, you can keep your magic.

1602
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,970
我想试试看刚刚我感受到的那股力量

1603
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,970
I want a taste of that new energy I just felt.

1604
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:34,370
彼得 嘿

1605
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:34,370
Oh, Peter. Hey.

1606
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,380
那些人到了吗

1607
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,380
Hey. Did those guys come through yet?

1608
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:38,520
应该有一个电人和一个沙人

1609
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:38,520
There should be an electric guy and a sand guy.

1610
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:41,150
来了 他们都到了且被关起来了

1611
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:41,150
Yeah. They're all here and locked up.

1612
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:43,340
太好了 我正要在这呆一会儿

1613
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:43,340
Perfect. I'm gonna just stay here for a bit, and try

1614
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:45,840
修复一下我刚刚造成的破坏 不然他们又要怪我了

1615
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:45,840
to fix this damage so they don't blame it on me again.

1616
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:48,180
- Okay. - Hey, I...

1617
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,420
没有你 这些我都办不到 所以

1618
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,420
I couldn't do any of this without you, so...

1619
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:53,190
谢谢你 当然

1620
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:53,190
- Thank you. - Yeah, of course.

1621
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:56,500
帮我问问那个人到底是颗树变成的怪兽

1622
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:56,500
Hey, ask him if this is like a tree monster,

1623
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:58,780
还是个科学家变成了颗树

1624
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:58,780
or like a scientist that turned into a tree.

1625
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:00,530
这是颗树吗

1626
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:00,530
Is this a tree, man?

1627
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:02,150
这就是颗树

1628
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:02,150
That's a tree.

1629
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:22,740
你个懦夫 现在有一个新的世界等待我们去征服

1630
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:22,740
Coward. We have a new world to conquer.

1631
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:28,160
你让我感到恶心 求求你不要打扰我

1632
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:28,160
- You make me sick. - Leave me alone. Please.

1633
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:30,810
一直躲在阴影之下

1634
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:30,810
Hiding in the shadows...

1635
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:33,710
一直躲避真实的自己

1636
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:33,710
Hiding from who you truly are.

1637
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:34,720
不

1638
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:34,720
No!

1639
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:37,430
你无法逃避你自己

1640
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:37,430
You can't escape yourself!

1641
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:54,560
嘿 梅 嘿 彼得

1642
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:54,560
- Hey, May. - Hey, Peter.

1643
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,190
我在上班呢 然后

1644
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,190
I'm at work, and, umm...

1645
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:58,960
你在找的其中一个人刚刚走了进来

1646
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:58,960
One of the guys you're looking for just walked in.

1647
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:10,440
梅 请问梅在哪儿 谢谢你

1648
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:10,440
May? Where's May? Thank you.

1649
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:18,680
嘿 他来了

1650
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:18,680
Hey, here he is.

1651
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,900
诺曼

1652
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,900
Norman,

1653
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,660
这是我的侄子

1654
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,660
this is my nephew.

1655
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,110
诺曼奥斯本

1656
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,110
Norman Osborn?

1657
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:26,380
我以为你已经...

1658
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:26,380
I thought that you were...

1659
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:30,030
我在这里的广告上看见了蜘蛛侠

1660
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:30,030
I saw Spider-Man in an ad for this place.

1661
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,670
我觉得他可以帮到我

1662
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,670
And I thought he could help me.

1663
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,670
但你不是他

1664
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,670
But you're not him.

1665
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,970
等等 你想要蜘蛛侠帮你

1666
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,970
Wait, so you want Spider-Man's help?

1667
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:38,920
他慢悠悠的就走进来了

1668
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:38,920
He just wandered in.

1669
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,570
我不知道还有哪儿可以去

1670
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,570
I didn't know where else to go.

1671
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:47,220
有其他人住在我的家里

1672
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:47,220
Someone's living in my house.

1673
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,660
而且奥斯本公司根本就不存在

1674
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,660
Oscorp doesn't exist.

1675
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:53,730
我的儿子

1676
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:53,730
My son...

1677
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:59,000
有些时候

1678
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:59,000
Sometimes,

1679
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,800
我感觉我不是我自己

1680
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,800
I'm not myself.

1681
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:03,280
我是

1682
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:03,280
I'm...

1683
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:04,960
其他人

1684
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:04,960
someone else.

1685
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:07,810
每当他控制我的身体的时候 我就什么都记不起来

1686
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:07,810
And, everytime he's in control, I can't remember.

1687
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,630
而现在 我在这个地方 这座城市

1688
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,630
And now, I'm here, in this place, in this city,

1689
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:11,660
我不知道

1690
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:11,660
and I don't know...

1691
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,520
我不知道我身上发生了什么

1692
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,520
I don't know what's going on with me.

1693
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:17,070
我不...这听起来不合常理

1694
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:17,070
I don't... It doesn't make sense.

1695
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,500
他迷失了

1696
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,500
He's lost.

1697
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,980
我不单单说的是在这个宇宙迷路了

1698
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,980
And I don't mean just in the cosmos.

1699
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,710
他自己的思想也迷失了

1700
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,710
I mean in his mind.

1701
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:28,230
他们全都像这样吗

1702
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:28,230
Are they all like this?

1703
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:29,950
对

1704
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:29,950
Yeah.

1705
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:33,160
我的意思是 他们本身或多或少都有点精神上或身体上的问题

1706
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:33,160
Well, I mean they all have their own, mental or physical issues.

1707
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,350
他需要帮助 也许他们所有人都需要帮助

1708
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,350
Well, he needs help, but maybe they all do.

1709
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:39,030
你不是说...不对 梅

1710
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:39,030
What, you don't mean... No, May, this...

1711
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:40,320
这不关我的事

1712
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:40,320
This isn't my problem.

1713
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:43,180
彼得 真的不关你的事吗

1714
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:43,180
Peter, not your problem? Mmm?

1715
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:44,440
梅

1716
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:44,440
May...

1717
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:47,420
他们回到原来的地方能得到帮助的机会要大得多

1718
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:47,420
Their chance of getting help is way better back where they came from.

1719
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:49,610
送他们回家

1720
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:49,610
Sending them home,

1721
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,720
这已经是我们能为他们做的最好的事情了

1722
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,720
That's the best thing that we can do for them.

1723
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:52,900
为他们

1724
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:52,900
For them?

1725
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,630
还是为你自己

1726
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,630
Or for yourself?

1727
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:58,650
看看你周围

1728
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:58,650
Look around you.

1729
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,290
这才是我们应该做的

1730
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,290
This is what we do.

1731
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:01,850
帮助他人

1732
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:01,850
We help people.

1733
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:04,920
这才是对他们来说最好的

1734
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:04,920
This is what's best, for them.

1735
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,570
相信我

1736
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,570
Trust me.

1737
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:10,570
但事实依然存在

1738
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:10,570
But the fact remains,

1739
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,130
蜘蛛侠依然是个威胁

1740
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,130
Spider-Man is a menace!

1741
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,420
马上回来

1742
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,420
We'll be right back, after a brief word from

1743
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:18,100
先播一段号角牌补充剂广告

1744
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:18,100
Daily Bugle supplements.

1745
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,900
另一个你的每日所需

1746
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,900
The only other Daily fix you need.

1747
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:22,200
完毕

1748
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:22,200
And, we're out.

1749
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:25,840
说

1750
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:25,840
What?

1751
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,420
我盯上他们了

1752
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,420
I got eyes on them.

1753
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:31,850
他跟他阿姨和一个我不认识的人在一起

1754
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:31,850
He's with his aunt and some guy I don't know.

1755
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:32,710
你确定

1756
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:32,710
You sure?

1757
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:33,980
他们刚刚离开收容所

1758
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:33,980
They're just leaving the shelter.

1759
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,380
好 不要跟丢了

1760
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,380
Okay. Don't lose him.

1761
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:47,700
谢谢 梅

1762
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:47,700
Thanks, May.

1763
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:49,620
希望能再次见到你

1764
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:49,620
Hope to see you again.

1765
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,070
Hey.

1766
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,420
他信任你

1767
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,420
He trusts you.

1768
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:53,900
我也是

1769
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:53,900
So do I.

1770
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:57,160
谢谢你把我的战服洗干净了

1771
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:57,160
Thanks for cleaning my suit.

1772
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,270
待会儿见

1773
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,270
I'll see you later.

1774
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:04,580
伙计们 这个是奥斯本先生 嘿 博士

1775
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:04,580
- Guys, this is Mr. Osborn. - Hey, it's Doctor.

1776
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:05,670
不好意思

1777
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:05,670
Sorry. Umm...

1778
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:08,140
奥斯本博士 这些是我的朋友 奈德和MJ

1779
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:08,140
Dr. Osborn, these are my friends, Ned and MJ.

1780
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:09,990
玛丽简

1781
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:09,990
Mary Jane?

1782
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,420
其实是米歇尔琼斯

1783
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,420
It's Michelle Jones, actually.

1784
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,540
挺迷人的名字

1785
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,540
Fascinating.

1786
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:21,690
你觉得这个世界上有没有另一个奈德利兹

1787
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:21,690
Do you think there are other Ned Leedses?

1788
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:36,270
奥克塔维思

1789
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:36,270
Octavius?

1790
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:41,560
奥斯本

1791
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:41,560
Osborn?

1792
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,600
你怎么了 发生了...

1793
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,600
- What... What happened to you? - What happened to...

1794
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:49,370
你就是一具行尸走肉 你什么意思

1795
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:49,370
- You're the walking corpse. - What do you mean?

1796
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:52,190
你已经死了 诺曼

1797
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:52,190
You died, Norman.

1798
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:53,850
一年前

1799
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:53,850
Years ago.

1800
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:56,060
你疯了

1801
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:56,060
You're insane.

1802
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,680
天 我太喜欢这里了

1803
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,680
God, I love it here.

1804
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,360
你到底在说什么

1805
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,360
What are you talking about?

1806
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:00,940
他就活生生的站在那儿

1807
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:00,940
He's standing right there.

1808
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,960
他没... 死

1809
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,960
- He's not... - Dead.

1810
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:05,940
他俩都在和蜘蛛侠争斗的过程中死了

1811
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:05,940
They both died. Fighting Spider-Man.

1812
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,460
新闻上到处都是

1813
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,460
It was all over the news.

1814
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,080
绿魔

1815
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,080
Green Goblin?

1816
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:16,780
被他自己的滑翔机刺穿身体而死

1817
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:16,780
Impaled by the glider he flew around on.

1818
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,000
两年后

1819
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,000
And a couple of years later...

1820
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:20,920
就是你 章鱼博士

1821
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:20,920
You. Doc Ock.

1822
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,210
你和你的机器一起坠入了河底

1823
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,210
Drowned in the river with your machine.

1824
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,530
一派胡言

1825
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,530
That's nonsense.

1826
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,620
蜘蛛侠当时想关掉我的聚变反应堆

1827
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,620
Spider-Man was trying to stop my fusion reactor.

1828
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:29,870
然后我阻止了他

1829
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:29,870
So I stopped him.

1830
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:34,020
我抓住他了 正中喉咙 然后...

1831
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:34,020
I had him, by the throat.... And then, I...

1832
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,440
然后我就在这儿了

1833
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,440
And then I was here.

1834
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,430
拜托 我告诉你件事

1835
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,430
Oh, please. Let me tell you something.

1836
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:45,740
我把蜘蛛侠胖揍了一顿 不信你去问蜘蛛侠

1837
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:45,740
I was whooping Spider-Man's ass. He'll tell you.

1838
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,350
然后蜘蛛侠引起电力过载 导致我被困在了电网里

1839
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,350
And then he caused an overload. I was stuck in the grid,

1840
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,360
吸收数据 正当我快要转变成纯能量的时候

1841
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,360
absorbing data. I was about to turn into pure energy,

1842
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,200
然后

1843
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,200
and then...

1844
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,430
然后...靠

1845
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,430
And then... Oh, shit.

1846
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:58,570
我就快死了

1847
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:58,570
I was about to die.

1848
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:01,840
麦克斯 你知不知道我死了没有

1849
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:01,840
Max, do you know? Do I die?

1850
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:08,510
太棒了 你又抓住了一个 不 等等 斯特兰奇 他没有威胁

1851
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:08,510
- Oh, great. You caught another one. - No, wait. Strange, he's not dangerous.

1852
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:12,770
没事的

1853
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:12,770
It's okay.

1854
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:16,550
那是什么

1855
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:16,550
What is that?

1856
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:19,330
古老的遗物 梅山帝之盒

1857
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:19,330
It's an ancient relic. The Machinati Codamus.

1858
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:22,960
我把你搞砸了的咒语困在里面 一旦你完成了仪式

1859
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:22,960
Trap your corrupted spell inside, once you've finished the proper ritual,

1860
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:26,790
咒语便会反转 把这些人送回他们的宇宙去

1861
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:26,790
will reverse the spell. And send these guys back to their universes.

1862
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:28,330
然后呢

1863
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:28,330
And then what?

1864
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,630
眼睁睁看着我们灭亡吗

1865
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,630
We perish?

1866
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,090
不了 谢谢 我觉得还是算了

1867
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,090
Nah. No thanks, I'll pass on that.

1868
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,660
放我出去 彼得

1869
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,660
Let me out of here. Peter!

1870
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:36,730
斯特兰奇

1871
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:36,730
Strange...

1872
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,010
我们不能把他们送回去 至少现在不能

1873
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,010
We can't send them back. Not yet.

1874
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:40,230
为什么

1875
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:40,230
Why?

1876
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,950
这里面有的人回去就得死

1877
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,950
Some of these guys are gonna die.

1878
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,350
帕克

1879
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,350
Parker...

1880
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:47,840
这是他们的命运

1881
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:47,840
it's their fate.

1882
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:50,520
拜托 斯特兰奇 做个人吧

1883
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:50,520
Come on, Strange. Have a heart.

1884
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,770
在多元宇宙的宏大计算中

1885
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,770
In the grand calculus of the multiverse,

1886
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:59,500
他们牺牲远比他们活着更重要

1887
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:59,500
their sacrifice means infinitely more than their lives.

1888
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,770
我很抱歉 孩子

1889
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,770
I'm sorry, kid.

1890
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,730
如果注定如此 他们便只能死

1891
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,730
If they die, they die.

1892
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:24,920
彼得

1893
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:24,920
Peter!

1894
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:39,410
不要

1895
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:39,410
Don't!

1896
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,980
- 老兄 你在干嘛 彼得 赶紧走 走

1897
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,980
Dude, what are you doing? - Peter, you gotta go. Go!

1898
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:49,700
这就是我永远都不想养孩子的原因

1899
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:49,700
This is why I never had kids.

1900
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:05,410
把盒子给我 不

1901
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:05,410
- Give me the box. - No.

1902
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:07,450
Whoa!

1903
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,660
天啊 我居然死了

1904
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,660
Oh, my God. I'm dead.

1905
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,550
你没死 你只是灵体分离了

1906
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,550
You're not dead. You've just been separated from your physical form.

1907
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:30,600
我的身体....什么

1908
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:30,600
My physical... What?!

1909
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:34,490
你怎么做到的 我也不知道

1910
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:34,490
- How are you doing that? - I have no idea.

1911
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:36,680
你不可能做得到这种事

1912
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:36,680
You should not be able to do that.

1913
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:38,500
感觉太神奇了

1914
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:38,500
This feels amazing.

1915
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:50,820
这可能是我有史以来经历过最酷的事情了

1916
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:50,820
That might be one of the coolest things that's

1917
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:53,030
但千万不要再那样做了

1918
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:53,030
ever happened to me. But don't ever do that again.

1919
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,530
放开我

1920
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,530
Hey. Get off of me!

1921
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,840
这是什么地方

1922
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,840
What is this place?

1923
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:53,560
由我掌控的镜像维度

1924
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:53,560
The Mirror Dimension. Where I'm in control.

1925
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,820
斯特兰奇 等一下 我们能不能好好的谈谈

1926
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,820
Strange, stop. Can we please just talk about this?

1927
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:08,320
帕克 你还没意识到

1928
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:08,320
Parker, don't you realize that in the multiverse,

1929
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:10,690
在多元宇宙之中

1930
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:10,690
there are an infinite number of people

1931
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:12,950
有无数的人知道彼得帕克是蜘蛛侠

1932
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:12,950
who know Peter Parker is Spider-Man.

1933
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:15,930
而咒语一旦失控 那些人就全部都会来到我们的宇宙中

1934
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:15,930
And if that spell gets loose, they're all coming here.

1935
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:19,240
我知道的 我明白 但我不能把他们送回去等死

1936
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:19,240
Look, I know. I get it. But we can't just send them home to die.

1937
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:24,030
这是他们的命 你没法改变 就像你没法改变他们的本性一样

1938
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:24,030
It's their fate. You can't change that anymore than you can change who they are.

1939
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:27,360
万一可以呢 也许我们可以改变他们的命运

1940
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:27,360
But what if we could? What if we can change their fate?

1941
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:30,550
你在干什么

1942
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:30,550
What are you doing?

1943
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:36,930
我是不会给你的...

1944
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:36,930
I'm not giving you the...

1945
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:49,370
还给我

1946
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:49,370
Give me that back.

1947
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:12,830
等一下 阿基米德螺旋

1948
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:12,830
Wait a minute, is that an Archimedean spiral?

1949
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:16,420
镜像维度只是几何学而已 你的几何学很好 你可以做几何

1950
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:16,420
The Mirror Dimension is just geometry? You're great at geometry. You can do geometry.

1951
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:21,900
半径先平方 再除以圆周率 再沿曲线绘制点…

1952
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:21,900
Square the radius, divided by, plot points along the curve...

1953
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:25,440
结束了 帕克 等事情结束以后我会回来接你的

1954
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:25,440
It's over, Parker. I'll come pick you up when it's done.

1955
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:31,960
嘿 斯特兰奇 你猜什么东西比魔法还酷

1956
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:31,960
Hey, Strange. You know what's cooler than magic?

1957
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,710
数学

1958
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,710
Math.

1959
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,430
别 千万别

1960
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,430
Don't do this.

1961
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:41,910
Oww.

1962
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,500
我很抱歉 先生 但是..

1963
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,500
I'm sorry, sir, but...

1964
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,220
我必须得试试

1965
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,220
I have to try.

1966
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:52,900
老兄 发生什么事了

1967
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:52,900
Dude, what happened?

1968
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,810
我刚刚跟奇异博士打了一架 而且我居然赢了

1969
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,810
I just had a fight with Doctor Strange and I totally won!

1970
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:57,060
什么 你看 我偷了他的环戒

1971
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:57,060
- What? - Look, and I stole his ring thing.

1972
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:59,680
我在城里荡来荡去 然后我穿过了这个…

1973
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:59,680
I was swinging through the city, and then I went through this...

1974
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,580
超级大的镜子一样的东西

1975
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,580
massive mirror thing,

1976
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:03,330
然后我就回来了 那他去哪儿了

1977
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:03,330
- and then I was back... - Where is he? Where is he?

1978
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:04,300
他被我困住了

1979
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:04,300
He's trapped, but...

1980
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,420
但我不知道能困他多久

1981
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,420
I'm not sure for how long.

1982
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:07,370
你本可以任由我们自生自灭

1983
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:07,370
You could've just left us to die.

1984
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,770
为什么你不这样做

1985
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,770
Why didn't you?

1986
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:10,420
因为他不是那种人

1987
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:10,420
Because that's not who he is.

1988
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,540
我认为我可以帮到你们

1989
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,540
I think I can help you guys.

1990
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:17,580
我可以挽回在你们身上发生的一切

1991
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:17,580
If I can fix what happened to you,

1992
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:19,590
然后你们再回去 事情就会变得跟以前不一样了

1993
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:19,590
then when you go back, things will be different

1994
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:22,120
也许你们就不会因为与蜘蛛侠战斗而死

1995
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:22,120
and you might not die fighting Spider-Man.

1996
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:23,180
你指的挽回（治疗）是什么

1997
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:23,180
What do you mean fix us?

1998
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,760
你看 我们拥有更为先进的科技 我可以帮助你们

1999
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,760
- Look, our technology is advanced... - I can help you.

2000
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:29,510
其实我自己也算是个科学家

2001
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:29,510
You know, I'm something of a scientist myself.

2002
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:32,920
章鱼博士知道我的能力水平

2003
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:32,920
Octavius knows what I can do.

2004
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,380
治疗 像兽医治狗一样

2005
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,380
Fix? You mean like a dog?

2006
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:36,840
容我拒绝

2007
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:36,840
I refuse.

2008
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,650
我不能向你们保证任何事情

2009
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,650
I can't promise you guys anything,

2010
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,000
但至少可以让你们有活着的机会回家

2011
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,000
but at least this way, we actually get to go home and have a chance.

2012
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:43,460
第二次机会

2013
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:43,460
A second chance.

2014
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,840
这难道还不值得试一试吗

2015
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,840
I mean, come on. Isn't that worth trying?

2016
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:47,290
相信我 彼得

2017
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:47,290
Trust me, Peter...

2018
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,260
当你想治好一个人的时候

2019
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,260
When you try to fix people,

2020
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:52,100
总是要付出一些代价的

2021
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:52,100
there are always consequences.

2022
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:53,760
你可以不来

2023
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:53,760
I mean, you don't have to come.

2024
01:00:54,370 --> 01:00:55,890
我还不知道你居然能说话

2025
01:00:54,370 --> 01:00:55,890
I also didn't know that you could talk.

2026
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:57,480
但如果你选择呆在这

2027
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:57,480
But if you stay here...

2028
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:59,790
你还得对付那个巫师

2029
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:59,790
you're gonna have to deal with the wizard.

2030
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:02,440
所以 要么一起走 要么留下等死

2031
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:02,440
So, we go along, or die.

2032
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:04,220
说的好像我有得选一样

2033
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:04,220
Not much of a choice, is it?

2034
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:05,860
我只想回家

2035
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:05,860
I just wanna go home.

2036
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:08,210
我只是单纯的不想死

2037
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:08,210
Well, I myself don't wanna be killed,

2038
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:11,380
尤其是不想死在一个穿的像《龙与地下城》里面的角色一样的人手下

2039
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:11,380
especially by a guy dressed like Dungeons & Dragons, so...

2040
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:13,140
你的计划是什么

2041
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:13,140
What's your plan?

2042
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,460
一切尽在掌控之中

2043
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,460
I have it all under control.

2044
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:21,640
这个东西该怎么处置

2045
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:21,640
What are we gonna do about this thing?

2046
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,650
找个安全的地方放着

2047
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,650
Well, we need to find somewhere safe for it, right?

2048
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:26,040
对对对 那你保管好它

2049
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:26,040
- Yeah. Yes. Yes. - You got to take it.

2050
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:26,730
等一下 什么

2051
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:26,730
Wait, what?

2052
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:29,190
如果我发生什么不测 我就发短信给你 到时候你就按这里

2053
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:29,190
If something bad happens, I'll text you, and then you just push this

2054
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:30,630
然后一切就都结束了 他们也就全没了

2055
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:30,630
and then it's all over, and they'll all be gone.

2056
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:32,130
我们跟你一起去 不能丢下你一个人

2057
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:32,130
We're going with you. We're not gonna leave you.

2058
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,270
你们不能跟我去 太危险了 你们做的已经足够多了

2059
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,270
You can't come with me. It's too dangerous. You guys have already done enough.

2060
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,740
彼得 我们要齐心协力 我知道我们要齐心协力

2061
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,740
- Peter, we're in this together. - I know we're in this together, Ned,

2062
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,390
但如果你们陷入危险的话我是做不好这件事的

2063
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,390
but I can't do this if I know that you're in danger.

2064
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,200
好吗 就当是为了我 MJ 请你保管好这个

2065
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,200
Okay? So for me, Mj please just take this.

2066
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:45,740
拜托了

2067
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:45,740
Please.

2068
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:47,920
好 谢谢

2069
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:47,920
- Fine. - Thank you.

2070
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:50,930
但是彼得 我发誓 如果到时我收不到你的消息 我就会按下这个按钮

2071
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:50,930
But Peter, I swear, if I don't hear from you, I'm pressing the button.

2072
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:53,690
好 我真的会按的

2073
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:53,690
- Sure. - Okay. And I will do it!

2074
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:56,580
我们相信你 米歇尔

2075
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:56,580
Yeah, we all believe you, Michelle.

2076
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:59,490
这妞不可能是他的女朋友 不可能

2077
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:59,490
No way that's his girlfriend. No way.

2078
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,560
她会按的 绝对会 绝对会

2079
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,560
- She'll do it. - Absolutely. She will.

2080
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:04,350
好吧

2081
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:04,350
Okay.

2082
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,260
待会见 注意安全

2083
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,260
- See you later. - Be safe.

2084
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:07,290
你也是

2085
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:07,290
You too.

2086
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:10,530
Whoa.

2087
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:12,950
Okay.

2088
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,040
注意安全好吗 你也是

2089
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,040
- Be careful, okay? - Yeah. You too.

2090
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:25,650
So, uhh...

2091
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,470
谁跟我一起来

2092
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,470
Who's coming with me?

2093
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:33,460
算我一个

2094
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:33,460
Well, I'm in.

2095
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:36,780
但如果出了什么差池

2096
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:36,780
But, if this goes sideways...

2097
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,890
我会把你烤个外焦里嫩

2098
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,890
I'm gonna fry you from the inside out.

2099
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,980
康纳斯哪儿去了 他说他想待在卡车里

2100
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,980
- Where's Connors? - He told me he wants to stay in the truck.

2101
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:57,290
报警系统已关闭

2102
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:57,290
- Okay. - Alarm systems, deactivated.

2103
01:02:58,030 --> 01:02:59,320
Okay.

2104
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:03,030
感觉有点对不起哈皮

2105
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:03,030
I feel kinda bad using Happy's place like this.

2106
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,000
没事 他不会说什么的

2107
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,000
No, no, no, no. He'll get over it.

2108
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:10,340
抱歉

2109
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:10,340
Sorry.

2110
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:12,450
这就是你的计划 彼得?

2111
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:12,450
So this is your plan, Peter?

2112
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,490
Mmm?

2113
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:16,600
实验室没有 设备也没有 在一个公寓里你能创造出什么奇迹

2114
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:16,600
No lab, no facilities, just performing miracles in a condominium?

2115
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:20,630
怎么着 你打算在微波炉里煮一些油条和冷冻玉米煎饼吗

2116
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:20,630
What, you're gonna cook up some churros, some frozen burritos in a microwave?

2117
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,220
玉米煎饼我可以

2118
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,220
I could go for a burrito.

2119
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:23,720
他会把我们全杀了

2120
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:23,720
He's gonna kill us all.

2121
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:25,200
希望不会这样

2122
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:25,200
Well, let's hope not.

2123
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:27,320
你第一个 博士

2124
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:27,320
You're up first, Doc.

2125
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:30,040
什么 我跟你说了 我不需要治疗

2126
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:30,040
What? Hey, I told you. I don't need fixing.

2127
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,620
我不需要

2128
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,620
I don't need fixing!

2129
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:36,830
尤其是一个十几岁的孩子用一个单身汉的垃圾抽屉里的废料

2130
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:36,830
Especially by a teenager using scraps from a bachelor's junk drawer.

2131
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:38,520
不不不不

2132
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:38,520
No, no, no, no.

2133
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,100
后面有什么东西

2134
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,100
He got something back there.

2135
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,390
我能感觉得到

2136
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,390
I can feel it.

2137
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:42,700
奇怪的能量

2138
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:42,700
Weird energy.

2139
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:44,950
那他么是什么东西

2140
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:44,950
What the hell is that?

2141
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:47,030
这是一个制造者

2142
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:47,030
It's a fabricator.

2143
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:50,890
它可以分析 设计 建造任何东西

2144
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:50,890
It can analyze, design, construct basically anything.

2145
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:53,950
我以为那个是哈皮压坏的晒黑床

2146
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:53,950
I thought that was a tanning bed Happy broke.

2147
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,820
好家伙

2148
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,820
Look at that.

2149
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:06,640
他会把我们全杀了

2150
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:06,640
He's gonna kill us all.

2151
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,410
博士脖子后面的芯片

2152
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,410
So, the chip in the back of Doc's neck

2153
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,070
是用来保护他的大脑不受触手AI系统的侵害

2154
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,070
was designed to protect his brain from the A.I. system

2155
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:25,020
同时控制他身后的触手 但如果你仔细看

2156
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:25,020
that's controlling these tentacles. But if you look here...

2157
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:28,350
芯片已经烧焦了

2158
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:28,350
The chip is fried.

2159
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:29,930
所以不是他在控制触手

2160
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:29,930
So rather than him being in control of the

2161
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:32,410
而是触手在控制他

2162
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:32,410
tentacles, the tentacles are now in control of him.

2163
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:34,570
这也能解释为什么

2164
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:34,570
Which, I guess explains why...

2165
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:37,430
他看上去一直都很痛苦

2166
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:37,430
he is so miserable all the time.

2167
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,210
口渴了

2168
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,210
Thirsty?

2169
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:51,840
对 确实有点渴

2170
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:51,840
Well, yes. I am thirsty.

2171
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:54,190
淡水还是海水

2172
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:54,190
Fresh water or salt?

2173
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:57,140
你懂的 因为你是章鱼嘛

2174
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:57,140
You know, because you're an octopus.

2175
01:04:58,720 --> 01:04:59,720
啥

2176
01:04:58,720 --> 01:04:59,720
What?

2177
01:05:01,290 --> 01:05:02,610
那就淡水吧

2178
01:05:01,290 --> 01:05:02,610
Fresh water it is.

2179
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:05,050
看看这个地方

2180
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:05,050
Look at this place.

2181
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,170
那么多可能性

2182
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,170
And all the possibilities.

2183
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:08,940
什么 这个公寓

2184
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:08,940
What? This condo?

2185
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:12,100
对 公寓 我喜欢这里的平面设计

2186
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:12,100
Yeah. yeah, the condo. I love the whole overfloor plan. No!

2187
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:14,520
不 我说的这个世界

2188
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:14,520
No, man. I'm talking about the world.

2189
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:17,540
我挺喜欢现在的自己

2190
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:17,540
I kinda like who I am here.

2191
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:23,680
你再看看后面那个能量源 有了它我能干更多事情

2192
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:23,680
And all that power back there? I could be so much more.

2193
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:25,790
所以你为什么来这儿

2194
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:25,790
So why did you come here?

2195
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,210
我有个女儿

2196
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,210
I have a daughter.

2197
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:31,130
我很想见她 但在他治好我们之前

2198
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:31,130
And I wanna see her. But he's not gonna send anyone home.

2199
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:34,060
我们是回不去的

2200
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:34,060
Till he's finished his little science project back there.

2201
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:37,610
你信任他吗 我谁也不信

2202
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:37,610
- You trust him? - I don't trust anyone.

2203
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:40,510
话说你是怎么变成这副样子的

2204
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:40,510
How'd you end up like that anyway?

2205
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:43,870
我工作的地方

2206
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:43,870
The place where I worked at...

2207
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:46,180
正在做一个和电能有关的实验

2208
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:46,180
They were experimenting with electricity

2209
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:48,690
由活体生物产生电能 然后

2210
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:48,690
created by living organisms, and then...

2211
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:51,820
我掉进了一个装满了电鳗的生物池里

2212
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:51,820
I fell into a vat of electric eels.

2213
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:53,420
开什么玩笑

2214
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:53,420
You're kidding.

2215
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:55,240
我掉进了一个超级对撞机里

2216
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:55,240
I fell into a supercollider.

2217
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:56,360
靠

2218
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:56,360
Damn.

2219
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:58,800
看来摔倒了也得小心会往哪儿掉

2220
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:58,800
Gotta be careful where you fall.

2221
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:01,490
令人印象深刻

2222
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:01,490
Remarkable.

2223
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,920
这个科技 还有你

2224
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,920
The technology and you.

2225
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:09,190
等一切都结束了以后

2226
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:09,190
When all this is over,

2227
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,540
如果你想要在另一个宇宙

2228
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,540
if you need a job and you're

2229
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:14,380
找一份工作的话...

2230
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:14,380
willing to commute to another universe...

2231
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:23,560
成功了 完全起作用了

2232
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:23,560
It worked. That totally worked!

2233
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,270
成功了 我做到了 你能叫他上来吗

2234
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,270
I got it. I did it. I did it. Will you send him up?

2235
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:27,490
来了来了

2236
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:27,490
Yup. Here we go.

2237
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,380
对不住了 忍忍 博士

2238
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,380
- Sorry. - Hold on, Doc.

2239
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:32,940
从我来这以后就一直受尽屈辱

2240
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:32,940
All of these humiliations never cease.

2241
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:36,010
你 把你所谓的科学产物拿的离我远点

2242
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:36,010
You! Keep your science fair project away from me!

2243
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:37,560
会起作用的 有点信心

2244
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:37,560
Hey, it will work. Have faith.

2245
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,470
你个把自己变成怪物的鲁莽傻瓜也好意思说

2246
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,470
Says the reckless fool who turned himself into a monster.

2247
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:45,220
请停下来 稳住不要动

2248
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:45,220
Please stop. Hold still.

2249
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,830
你要是敢这样做的话

2250
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,830
Don't you dare.

2251
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:55,030
我发誓 等我挣脱了这个触手 我一定要...

2252
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:55,030
I swear... when I get out of this wicker, I'm gonna...

2253
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:01,260
博士

2254
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:01,260
Doc?

2255
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:08,110
博士

2256
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:08,110
Doc?

2257
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:11,120
博士

2258
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:11,120
Doc?

2259
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:13,400
章鱼博士

2260
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:13,400
Doctor Octavius?

2261
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:21,840
好安静...

2262
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:21,840
It's so quiet...

2263
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:26,510
我脑子里面的...

2264
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:26,510
Those voices...

2265
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,320
声音...

2266
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,320
Inside my head...

2267
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:34,750
我差点忘了...

2268
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:34,750
I'd almost forgotten...

2269
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:37,460
奥托

2270
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:37,460
Otto.

2271
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:39,290
在

2272
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:39,290
Yes.

2273
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:40,880
诺曼

2274
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:40,880
Norman.

2275
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:47,790
是我

2276
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:47,790
It's me.

2277
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:51,790
真不敢相信

2278
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:51,790
Would you look at that.

2279
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:15,250
我太感激你了 亲爱的 真的

2280
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:15,250
I'm grateful, dear boy. Truly.

2281
01:08:15,370 --> 01:08:17,080
不用客气

2282
01:08:15,370 --> 01:08:17,080
Yeah. You're welcome.

2283
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,940
我能帮到你吗

2284
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,940
How can I help you?

2285
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:21,290
我是彼得 请留言

2286
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:21,290
This is Peter. Leave a message.

2287
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:25,870
彼得 我是哈皮 我看了下我家房门旁的摄像头

2288
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:25,870
Yeah, Peter, this is Happy. I accessed my doorbell camera...

2289
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,980
那些家伙是谁

2290
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,980
Who are those guys, huh? Is that a cyborg, you

2291
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:30,480
你带了个八爪机器臂的生化人来我家

2292
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:30,480
bring a cyborg with robot legs into my house?

2293
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,370
那个家伙是泥巴变的吗 发生什么了 速速回电

2294
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,370
One of the guys was made of mud? What's going on? Call me back.

2295
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:43,990
感觉如何 诺曼

2296
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:43,990
How does it feel, Norman?

2297
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:46,970
你即将再次成为一个完整的个体

2298
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:46,970
You're about to become whole again.

2299
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:49,970
邪恶人格将不复存在

2300
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:49,970
No more darker half.

2301
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,220
只有你自己

2302
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,220
Just you.

2303
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:54,260
只有我

2304
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:54,260
Just me.

2305
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:04,770
好吧

2306
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:04,770
Okay. Umm...

2307
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:08,250
这个放在这 这个的话...

2308
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:08,250
It just goes right here, this one...

2309
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:10,790
这个应该能吸收更多的电能

2310
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:10,790
That should be drawing power now.

2311
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:13,140
我马上来检查一下 但...

2312
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:13,140
I'm gonna come back in a second just to check on it, but...

2313
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,490
注意灯光 等他们全变绿的时候

2314
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,490
Keep an eye on the lights. When they're all green, it

2315
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:17,580
就意味着你体内的电流就全部消失了

2316
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:17,580
means all the electricity in your body's dissipated.

2317
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:18,870
当然 并不是所有电都会消失

2318
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:18,870
Well, not all the electricity.

2319
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:22,030
因为人的大脑很明显需要电才能正常运作...

2320
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:22,030
I mean, obviously you know you need electricity for your brain to function...

2321
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,080
你的神经系统也是...

2322
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,080
Your nervous system is...

2323
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,390
我为什么要跟你普及跟电有关的这些知识

2324
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,390
I'm not really sure why I'm explaining electricity to you.

2325
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:28,690
我可以问你个问题吗 当然

2326
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:28,690
- Can I ask you a question? - Sure.

2327
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,490
这些是你的玩具

2328
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,490
Are these your legos?

2329
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:33,310
我得走了

2330
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:33,310
I gotta go.

2331
01:09:33,450 --> 01:09:34,680
马上回来

2332
01:09:33,450 --> 01:09:34,680
I'll be back.

2333
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:43,220
感觉不太对劲 你指哪方面

2334
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:43,220
- Something feels off. - What do you mean?

2335
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:46,150
我不太喜欢这样 不要管他

2336
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:46,150
- I don't like this. - Leave it alone.

2337
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:50,220
你们越早解决这件事 我们就能越早回家

2338
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:50,220
The sooner you guys get through with this, the sooner we go home.

2339
01:09:57,910 --> 01:10:00,230
他在哪儿 里面

2340
01:09:57,910 --> 01:10:00,230
- Well? Where is he? - He's inside.

2341
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:03,780
但我们现在在外面 我不是跟你说了不要跟丢吗

2342
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:03,780
And yet here we are outside. Did you not hear me say don't lose him?

2343
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,310
我需要蜘蛛侠的清晰影像

2344
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,310
I want incriminating footage of Spider-Man.

2345
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:10,620
黑暗就此展开

2346
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:10,620
And so it begins.

2347
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,240
彼得

2348
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,240
Peter?

2349
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,560
怎么了 我不知道

2350
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,560
- What's wrong? - I don't know.

2351
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,880
梅

2352
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,880
May?

2353
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,160
怎么了 彼得

2354
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,160
What is it, Peter?

2355
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:54,440
怎么样 彼得

2356
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:54,440
What's up, Peter?

2357
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:03,370
你为什么用这副表情看我

2358
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:03,370
Why are you looking at me like that?

2359
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:23,620
很巧妙的小技巧 你的蜘蛛感应

2360
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:23,620
That's some neat trick. That sense of yours.

2361
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:24,540
诺曼

2362
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:24,540
Norman?

2363
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:26,670
诺曼休假去了

2364
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:26,670
Norman's on sabbatical.

2365
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:28,750
我靠

2366
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:28,750
The hell?

2367
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:30,150
绿魔

2368
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:30,150
Goblin.

2369
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:36,570
你真的觉得我会让邪恶人格消失这种事情发生吗

2370
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:36,570
No more darker half? Did you really think that I'd let that happen?

2371
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:39,730
我让你夺走我的能力仅仅是因为

2372
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:39,730
That I'd let you take away my power just because

2373
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:42,930
你不知道真正的力量能带给你什么

2374
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:42,930
you're blind to what true power can bring you?

2375
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:44,950
你不认识我 是吗

2376
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:44,950
- You don't know me. - Don't I?

2377
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:50,780
我能看得出来她束缚了你的手脚

2378
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:50,780
I saw how she trapped you.

2379
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:54,530
让你为她神圣的道德使命而战

2380
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:54,530
Fighting her holy moral mission.

2381
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:58,940
我们不需要你来拯救

2382
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:58,940
We don't need you to save us.

2383
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,230
我们不需要治疗

2384
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,230
We don't need to be fixed.

2385
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,910
我们的能力不是诅咒

2386
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,910
These are not curses.

2387
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,600
而是上天赐予的礼物

2388
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,600
They're gifts.

2389
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:11,620
诺曼 不要

2390
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:11,620
Norman, no.

2391
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:14,280
安静点 狗腿子 你根本不知道你自己在说些什么

2392
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:14,280
- Quiet, lapdog. - You don't know what you're talking about.

2393
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:19,230
我一直在诺曼懦弱的眼睛后面观察你

2394
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:19,230
I watched you from deep behind Norman's cowardly eyes.

2395
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:25,740
你在挣扎 为自己想要的一切而挣扎

2396
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:25,740
Struggling, to have everything you want,

2397
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:29,340
但现实社会却一直在逼你做选择

2398
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:29,340
while the world tries to make you choose.

2399
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:34,400
而神不用做选择

2400
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:34,400
Gods don't have to choose.

2401
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:37,970
我们想要什么就抢什么

2402
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:37,970
We take.

2403
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:39,840
梅 快跑

2404
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:39,840
May, run!

2405
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:06,110
我的老天爷 你做了什么

2406
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:06,110
Oh, my God. What have you done?

2407
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:08,310
我更喜欢以前的你

2408
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:08,310
I liked you better before.

2409
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:20,630
上面 他在上面 是大桥上那个人

2410
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:20,630
Up here! He's up there. It's the guy from the bridge.

2411
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:45,060
你看见了吗

2412
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:45,060
Did you see that?

2413
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:12,490
放开我

2414
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:12,490
Get off me!

2415
01:14:21,610 --> 01:14:24,380
身体强大到可以拥有一切...

2416
01:14:21,610 --> 01:14:24,380
Strong enough to have it all...

2417
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:29,180
内心却异常的懦弱

2418
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:29,180
Too weak to take it!

2419
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:06,040
现在逮到你了

2420
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:06,040
Now I've gotcha.

2421
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:10,110
我早就跟你说过要付出代价

2422
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:10,110
I told you there'd be consequences!

2423
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:30,140
你的弱点 彼得...

2424
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:30,140
Your weakness, Peter...

2425
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:31,960
就是你的良心

2426
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:31,960
is morality.

2427
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:34,260
你的良心快把你噎死了

2428
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:34,260
It's choking you.

2429
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,860
你能感觉到吗

2430
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,860
Can you feel it?

2431
01:15:44,490 --> 01:15:46,010
这根本没用

2432
01:15:44,490 --> 01:15:46,010
It didn't work.

2433
01:15:47,070 --> 01:15:48,670
诺曼是对的

2434
01:15:47,070 --> 01:15:48,670
Norman was right.

2435
01:15:48,930 --> 01:15:51,590

做好事是会受到惩罚的

2452
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:25,030
No good deed goes unpunished.

2453

可以等你以后懂了再感谢我

2454

我在这

2462
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,680

2463
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:16,870

2464
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:16,870
- Are you okay? - Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

2465
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:22,210

2466
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:22,210
Really?

2467
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:23,240
Yeah.

2468
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,390

2469
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,390
It's okay. We're okay, right?

2470
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:25,930
Yeah.

2471
01:17:25,950 --> 01:17:27,150
差点把头撞掉

2472
01:17:25,950 --> 01:17:27,150
Knocked off my head.

2473
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:28,690
我也是 没伤到其他地方就好

2474
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:28,690
- Yeah, me too. - That's all.

2475
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:32,660
我觉得我肋骨好像断了

2476
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:32,660
I think I broke my ribs.

2477
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:39,130
这都是我的错 梅

2478
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:39,130
This is all my fault, May.

2479
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:41,680
我应该听斯特兰奇的话把他们全送回去...

2480
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:41,680
I should've just listened to Strange and let him send them back...

2481
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:43,040
你做的是对的

2482
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:43,040
You did the right thing.

2483
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:45,400
不然他们会死的

2484
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:45,400
They would have been killed.

2485
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:46,890
你做的是对的

2486
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:46,890
You did the right thing.

2487
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:49,480
这不是我的责任 梅

2488
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:49,480
It's not my responsibility, May.

2489
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:54,720
诺曼说什么了

2490
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:54,720
What Norman said?

2491
01:17:55,830 --> 01:17:57,480
我的道德使命

2492
01:17:55,830 --> 01:17:57,480
My moral mission. No.

2493
01:17:57,570 --> 01:18:00,160
不 彼得 听着 听我说

2494
01:17:57,570 --> 01:18:00,160
No, Peter. Listen. You listen to me.

2495
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:02,570
你拥有与生俱来的天赋

2496
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:02,570
You have a gift.

2497
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,340
你也有无比强大的力量

2498
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,340
You have power.

2499
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:07,610
一个人能力越大

2500
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:07,610
And with great power,

2501
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:11,050
责任也就越大

2502
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:11,050
there must also come great responsibility.

2503
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:17,370
我知道的

2504
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:17,370
Yeah. I know.

2505
01:18:17,870 --> 01:18:19,770
我们离开这儿吧

2506
01:18:17,870 --> 01:18:19,770
Let's get out of here.

2507
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,160
好 走吧

2508
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,160
Okay, let's go.

2509
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,730
发生什么了 你还好吗

2510
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,730
What happened? Are you okay?

2511

2518
01:18:50,710 --> 01:18:51,900
We're gonna take our time,

2519
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:53,120
你深呼吸 然后...

2520
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:53,120
you catch your breath, and...

2521
01:18:53,190 --> 01:18:55,010
然后我们带你去医院 好吗

2522
01:18:53,190 --> 01:18:55,010
and we'll take you to a Doctor, okay?

Run!

2559
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:42,740
一场悲剧

2560
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:42,740
Tragedy.

2561
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:48,080
我还能说什么

2562
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:48,080
What else can I call it?

2563
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:50,560
还需要说什么

2564
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:50,560
What more need be said?

2565
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:52,460
造成的伤害...

2566
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:52,460
The damage...

2567
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:54,590
破坏...

2568
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:54,590
The destruction...

2569
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:56,960
你自己亲眼都看见了

2570
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:56,960
You saw it with your own eyes.

2571
01:21:58,220 --> 01:22:00,970
当人们醒来时会发现

2572
01:21:58,220 --> 01:22:00,970
When will people wake up, and realize

2573
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:03,500
蜘蛛侠所到之处...

2574
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:03,500
that everywhere Spider-Man goes...

2575
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:06,850
混乱和灾难将会随之而至

2576
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:06,850
Chaos and calamity ensue.

2577
01:22:06,970 --> 01:22:11,600
蜘蛛侠所触碰之物 皆会化为乌有

2578
01:22:06,970 --> 01:22:11,600
Everything Spider-Man touches comes to ruin.

2579
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:17,040
而我们这些无辜的人 却被留下来收拾残局

2580
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:17,040
And we, the innocents, are left to pick up the pieces.

2598
01:23:20,210 --> 01:23:22,930
I just wish... I just wish that we could see him.

2599
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:29,740

2600
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:29,740

01:23:34,430 --> 01:23:36,270
我只想见他一面

2605
01:23:34,430 --> 01:23:36,270
I just wish we could see him.

2606
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:40,380
好吧

2607
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:40,380
Okay...

2608
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:42,930
我只想见彼得一面

2609
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:42,930
I just wish we could see Peter.

2610
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:49,730
Salamangkero!

2611
01:23:49,850 --> 01:23:51,920
你是对的 我确实会魔法

2612
01:23:49,850 --> 01:23:51,920
You're right. I am magic.

2613
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:56,140
是他吗 是 肯定是

2614
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:56,140
- Is that him? - Yeah, yeah. It has to be.

2615
01:23:56,210 --> 01:23:58,110
彼得 彼得 嘿 彼得

2616
01:23:56,210 --> 01:23:58,110
- Peter. Peter! - Hey, Peter!

2617
01:23:58,170 --> 01:23:59,170
彼得

2618
01:23:58,170 --> 01:23:59,170
Peter!

2619
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:09,170
Hi. Hi!

2620
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:12,870
没事的没事的 我是个好人

2621
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:12,870
No, no, no. It's okay, it's okay. I'm nice guy.

2622
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:16,110
Okay...

2623
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,210
你他么是谁

2624
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,210
Who the hell are you?

2625
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:21,560
我是彼得帕克

2626
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:21,560
I'm Peter Parker.

2627
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:22,720
不可能

2628
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:22,720
That's not possible.

2629
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:24,140
我是蜘蛛侠

2630
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:24,140
I am Spider-Man.

2631
01:24:25,070 --> 01:24:27,530
在我的世界是 然后昨天

2632
01:24:25,070 --> 01:24:27,530
In my world. But then, yesterday?

2633
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:29,100
我就...

2634
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:29,100
I was...

2635
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:32,660
我就在这儿了

2636
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:32,660
I was just here.

2637
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:34,670
Wow.

2638
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:38,530
弦理论...

2639
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:38,530
String theory...

2640
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:40,730
多维现实...

2641
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:40,730
Multidimensional reality...

2642
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:43,790
还有物质转换

2643
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:43,790
And matter displacement.

2644
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:45,180
都是真的

2645
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:45,180
All real?

2646
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:46,330
Yeah...

2647
01:24:46,510 --> 01:24:47,650
我就知道

2648
01:24:46,510 --> 01:24:47,650
Knew it!

2649
01:24:48,910 --> 01:24:50,830
这肯定是那个咒语的缘故

2650
01:24:48,910 --> 01:24:50,830
This has to be because of the spell.

2651
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:52,410
咒语

2652
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:52,410
The spell?

2653
01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:54,200
魔法咒语 不存在什么咒语

2654
01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:54,200
- Like magic spell? - There's no spell.

2655
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:54,990
没有咒语 没有

2656
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:54,990
- No spell. - No.

2657
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:56,350
这里居然还有魔法

2658
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:56,350
Magic's real here, too?

2659
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:57,430
我的意思是... 闭嘴 奈德

2660
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:57,430
- I mean.. - Shut up, Ned.

2661
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:58,820
不 是假的

2662
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:58,820
No, it's not real.

2663
01:24:58,850 --> 01:24:59,860
闭嘴 我...

2664
01:24:58,850 --> 01:24:59,860
- Shut up. - I mean...

2665
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:01,780
有魔术师之类的东西 但没有...

2666
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:01,780
There's magicians and stuff, but there's no like...

2667
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:04,100
打住 打住

2668
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:04,100
Stop it. Stop.

2669
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:06,070
证明给我看 证明什么

2670
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:06,070
- Prove it. - Prove what?

2671
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:07,210
证明你是彼得帕克

2672
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:07,210
That you're Peter Parker.

2673
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:09,360
那我也没带身份证啊

2674
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:09,360
don't carry an ID with me, you know?

2675
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:11,790
带身份证这种行为不是匿名英雄的风格

2676
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:11,790
Kinda defeats the whole anonymous superhero thing?

2677
01:25:14,390 --> 01:25:15,620
你为什么这么做

2678
01:25:14,390 --> 01:25:15,620
Why'd you do that?

2679
01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:17,010
看看你有没有一激灵

2680
01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:17,010
To see if you have the tingle thing.

2681
01:25:17,050 --> 01:25:19,000
我有一激灵 但对面包不起作用

2682
01:25:17,050 --> 01:25:19,000
I have the tingle thing, just not from bread.

2683
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:23,130
能不能不要扔面包了 你是个非常不信任别人的人

2684
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:23,130
Can you not throw the bread again? You're a deeply mistrusting person.

2685
01:25:24,810 --> 01:25:25,910
我尊重这一点

2686
01:25:24,810 --> 01:25:25,910
And I respect that.

2687
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:33,750
爬爬看 爬爬看

2688
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:33,750
- Crawl around. - Crawl around?

2689
01:25:33,890 --> 01:25:35,380
对 我不

2690
01:25:33,890 --> 01:25:35,380
- Yes. - No.

2691
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,100
爬爬看 为什么要我爬爬看

2692
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,100
- Crawl around. - Why do I need to crawl around?

2693
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:38,720
因为还不足以证明你是蜘蛛侠 已经足够了

2694
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:38,720
- Cause it's not enough. - This is plenty.

2695
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,240
不够 够了

2696
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,240
- No, it's not. - Yes, it is.

2697
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:42,580
不够 粘在天花板上还不够

2698
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:42,580
- Nuh-uh. - How do I stick to the ceiling?

2699
01:25:42,610 --> 01:25:43,650
快点

2700
01:25:42,610 --> 01:25:43,650
Do it.

2701
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:46,340
Ned...

2702
01:25:46,370 --> 01:25:48,150
sabihin mo diyan sa mamang yan,

2703
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:51,960
na alisin yung agiw sa sulok. Ha?

2704
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:54,810
我奶奶问你能不能顺便帮他清理下那边的蜘蛛网

2705
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:54,810
My Lola's asking if you could just get the cobweb there.

2706
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,090
大概 在那儿

2707
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,090
- It's too, like, up there? - Yeah.

2708
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:06,740
谢谢

2709
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:06,740
Thank you.

2710
01:26:10,270 --> 01:26:11,680
可以了吗

2711
01:26:10,270 --> 01:26:11,680
We're good?

2712
01:26:12,150 --> 01:26:13,030
可以了

2713
01:26:12,150 --> 01:26:13,030
We're good.

2714
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:14,550
暂时而言

2715
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:14,550
For now.

2716
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:17,890
所以 我开错了传送门找错了彼得帕克

2717
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:17,890
So, I opened a wrong portal to the wrong Peter Parker.

2718
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:20,810
我想你可以一直这么做直到你找到正确的那个为止

2719
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:20,810
Yeah, I guess you just keep doing it until you find the real one.

2720
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,380
伤心 无意冒犯

2721
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,380
- Ouch. - No offense.

2722
01:26:22,650 --> 01:26:23,820
好的

2723
01:26:22,650 --> 01:26:23,820
- Okay.

2724
01:26:23,910 --> 01:26:24,920
你能行

2725
01:26:23,910 --> 01:26:24,920
You're good.

2726
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:28,170
找到彼得帕克

2727
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:28,170
Find Peter Parker.

2728
01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:30,090
那个眼神和手势是怎么回事

2729
01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:30,090
What's with the eyes and hand?

2730
01:26:30,630 --> 01:26:32,290
找到彼得帕克

2731
01:26:30,630 --> 01:26:32,290
Find Peter Parker.

2732
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:36,160
给我找到彼得帕克

2733
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:36,160
Find Peter Parker!

2734
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:47,110
棒极了 普通老百姓一个

2735
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:47,110
Great, it's just some random guy.

2736
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:48,580
哈喽

2737
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:48,580
Hello.

2738
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,290
我想我从这边跨过来应该没什么问题吧

2739
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,290
I hope it's okay, I just came through this...

2740
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:54,840
居然关了

2741
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:54,840
It just closed.

2742
01:26:56,230 --> 01:26:57,410
你是彼得

2743
01:26:56,230 --> 01:26:57,410
You're Peter?

2744
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,520
对 彼得帕克

2745
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,520
Yeah. Peter Parker.

2746
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,160
我之前见过你们俩...

2747
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,160
I... I've seen you two...

2748
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:07,780
Hi.

2749
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:12,950
等一下 他是...

2750
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:12,950
Wait. He's...

2751
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:14,430
他不是你们俩的朋友...

2752
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:14,430
He's not your friend...

2753
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:32,190
哇噢 所以你也是蜘蛛侠咯

2754
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:32,190
Whoa, it's... So you're Spider-Man too?

2755
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:33,580
你为什么不早说

2756
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:33,580
Why didn't you just say that?

2757
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:36,130
我一般不会大张旗鼓的宣扬此事

2758
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:36,130
I generally don't go around advertising it.

2759
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:38,630
自吹自擂这种行为不是匿名英雄的风格

2760
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:38,630
Kinda defeats the whole anonymous superhero thing.

2761
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:40,030
我刚刚才说过这句话 他刚刚才说过这句话

2762
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:40,030
- That's what I just said... - That's what he just said.

2763
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:42,870
Ikaw, ha? Nagkalat ka nanaman.

2764
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,070
Linisin mo lahat ng mga basura mo dito.

2765
01:27:46,090 --> 01:27:49,600
At ikaw? Alam mo na gusto ko itong bahay natin, maayos.

2766
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:52,680
pero tingnan mo, dumi dito, dumi doon.

2767
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:55,810
我奶奶问你能不能把你们刚刚射的蜘蛛网打扫干净

2768
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:55,810
My Lola's asking if you could clean up the webs that you just shot.

2769
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:56,890
对不起奶奶

2770
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:56,890
Oh. Sorry, Lola.

2771
01:27:56,940 --> 01:27:57,980
当然

2772
01:27:56,940 --> 01:27:57,980
Yes, of course.

2773
01:27:58,010 --> 01:27:59,160
我要睡觉了

2774
01:27:58,010 --> 01:27:59,160
I'm going to bed.

2775
01:27:59,390 --> 01:28:00,400
晚安 奶奶

2776
01:27:59,390 --> 01:28:00,400
Good night, Lola.

2777
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:05,020
说起来有点怪 但是...

2778
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:05,020
This might seem kind of weird, but...

2779
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,310
自从我来到这边以后我就一直在找你们的朋友

2780
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,310
I've been trying to find your friend ever since I got here.

2781
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:11,370
我有种预感...

2782
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:11,370
I just had this sense that...

2783
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:14,570
他需要我的帮助

2784
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:14,570
That he needs my help.

2785
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:15,750
我们的帮助

2786
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:15,750
Our help.

2787
01:28:18,110 --> 01:28:19,120
他确实需要

2788
01:28:18,110 --> 01:28:19,120
He does.

2789
01:28:19,290 --> 01:28:20,430
但我们不知道他在哪儿

2790
01:28:19,290 --> 01:28:20,430
We don't know where he is.

2791
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:21,540
And, umm...

2792
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:24,620
而且说实话 我们现在是他唯一的亲人了

2793
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:24,620
Honestly, right now, we're all he really has left.

2794
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,900
好吧 有没有那种地方

2795
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,900
Well, is there some place,

2796
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:33,160
那种对他来说有特殊意义的地方

2797
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:33,160
that he might go that has meaning to him?

2798
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:35,910
比如...

2799
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:35,910
Like a...

2800
01:28:36,450 --> 01:28:38,090
一个可以让他

2801
01:28:36,450 --> 01:28:38,090
a place where he would go to just...

2802
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:39,730
远离世间所有喧嚣的地方

2803
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:39,730
Get away from everything?

2804
01:28:42,930 --> 01:28:45,880
对我来说 是克莱斯勒大厦顶端

2805
01:28:42,930 --> 01:28:45,880
For me, it was the top of the Chrysler Building.

2806
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:47,780
我是帝国大厦

2807
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:47,780
Empire State.

2808
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:49,540
景色更好

2809
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:49,540
Better view.

2810
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:50,750
景色确实相当好

2811
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:50,750
That is a sweet view.

2812
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:54,670
想起来了

2813
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:54,670
Yes.

2814
01:28:55,490 --> 01:28:58,240
我想我知道是哪儿了

2815
01:28:55,490 --> 01:28:58,240
Yeah, I think I know exactly where that would be.

2816
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:44,420
我想我知道在哪儿了

2817
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:48,060
有些人想见你

2818
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:48,060
there's some people here...

2819
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:49,530
谁

2820
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:49,530
Who?

2821
01:29:59,030 --> 01:30:00,670
嘿 等等 哇哦

2822
01:29:59,030 --> 01:30:00,670
Hey. Wait, wait, whoa.

2823
01:30:05,530 --> 01:30:07,060
我很抱歉…

2824
01:30:05,530 --> 01:30:07,060
Sorry...

2825
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,790
梅姨…

2826
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,790
About May.

2827
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:15,130
很抱歉

2828
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:15,130
Yeah. Sorry.

2829
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:18,780
我能跟你感同身受…

2830
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:18,780
I got some understanding of what you're going through...

2831
01:30:18,810 --> 01:30:21,070
别 千万别说你可以跟我感同身受

2832
01:30:18,810 --> 01:30:21,070
No, please don't tell me that you know what I'm going through.

2833
01:30:22,030 --> 01:30:23,030
好吧

2834
01:30:22,030 --> 01:30:23,030
Okay.

2835
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:24,730
她死了

2836
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:24,730
She's gone.

2837
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:28,760
这都怪我

2838
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:28,760
It's all my fault.

2839
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:34,250
她死的毫无意义

2840
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:34,250
She died for nothing.

2841
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:40,180
我一开始就应该直接把他们送回去的

2842
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:40,180
So I'm gonna do what I should've done in the first place.

2843
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,080
- 彼得 - 请不要这样

2844
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,080
- Peter... - Please, don't.

2845
01:30:43,370 --> 01:30:46,700
你不属于这 你也是 我要把你们都送回去

2846
01:30:43,370 --> 01:30:46,700
You don't belong here. Either of you, so I'm sending you home.

2847
01:30:48,260 --> 01:30:50,310
那些坏蛋来自于你们的世界 对不对

2848
01:30:48,260 --> 01:30:50,310
Those other guys are from your worlds, right?

2849
01:30:51,190 --> 01:30:52,320
所以得你们去搞定他们

2850
01:30:51,190 --> 01:30:52,320
So you deal with it.

2851
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:54,360
他们死了也好 你们杀了他们也好

2852
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:54,360
If they die, if you kill them...

2853
01:30:55,770 --> 01:30:57,040
都是你们自己的事

2854
01:30:55,770 --> 01:30:57,040
That's on you.

2855
01:30:57,930 --> 01:30:59,160
不关我的事

2856
01:30:57,930 --> 01:30:59,160
It's not my problem.

2857
01:30:59,510 --> 01:31:00,730
我什么都不在乎了

2858
01:30:59,510 --> 01:31:00,730
I don't care anymore.

2859
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:03,210
我受够了

2860
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:03,210
I'm done.

2861
01:31:08,110 --> 01:31:10,290
我很抱歉把你们牵扯进来

2862
01:31:08,110 --> 01:31:10,290
I'm really sorry that I dragged you into this.

2863
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:15,510
但现在你们该回家了

2864
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:15,510
But you have to go home now.

2865
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:19,340
祝你们好运

2866
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:19,340
Good luck.

2867
01:31:24,810 --> 01:31:26,510
我的本叔叔曾经也被杀害了

2868
01:31:24,810 --> 01:31:26,510
My Uncle Ben was killed.

2869
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:29,430
那件事也全都是我的错

2870
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:29,430
It was my fault.

2871
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:32,080
我失去了…

2872
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:32,080
I lost...

2873
01:31:34,970 --> 01:31:36,680
我失去了格温 我的…

2874
01:31:34,970 --> 01:31:36,680
I lost Gwen. My...

2875
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:39,530
我的MJ

2876
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:39,530
She was my MJ.

2877
01:31:42,140 --> 01:31:43,390
我没能救下她

2878
01:31:42,140 --> 01:31:43,390
I couldn't save her.

2879
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:47,600
我一辈子都没办法原谅我自己

2880
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:47,600
I'm never gonna be able to forgive myself for that.

2881
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:52,660
但我得振作起来 我得…

2882
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:52,660
But I carried on. Tried to...

2883
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:55,920
我得往前继续走

2884
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:55,920
Tried to keep going. Tried to keep being the...

2885
01:31:57,730 --> 01:31:59,800
我得继续做友好邻居蜘蛛侠

2886
01:31:57,730 --> 01:31:59,800
... friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, because

2887
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:01,280
因为我知道她也会希望我能继续做蜘蛛侠

2888
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:01,280
I know that's what she would have wanted.

2889
01:32:01,310 --> 01:32:02,190
但是

2890
01:32:01,310 --> 01:32:02,190
But...

2891
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:04,210
在那之后 我开始…

2892
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:04,210
At some point, I just...

2893
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:05,920
我不会再手下留情

2894
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:05,920
I stopped pulling my punches.

2895
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:11,050
我变得很易怒

2896
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:11,050
I got rageful.

2897
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,500
很残忍

2898
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,500
I got bitter.

2899
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:20,420
我希望你不要变得 像我一样

2900
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:20,420
I just don't want you, to end up like... Like me.

2901
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:24,390
那夜我失去了本叔叔

2902
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:24,390
The night Ben died,

2903
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:28,110
于是我去追杀那个凶手

2904
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:28,110
I hunted down the man who I thought did it.

2905
01:32:29,590 --> 01:32:31,290
我想要他死

2906
01:32:29,590 --> 01:32:31,290
I wanted him dead.

2907
01:32:33,740 --> 01:32:35,400
我如愿以偿了

2908
01:32:33,740 --> 01:32:35,400
I got what I wanted.

2909
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:39,460
但这并没有让我释怀

2910
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:39,460
It didn't make it better.

2911
01:32:43,430 --> 01:32:45,720
我反而花了更长时间去…

2912
01:32:43,430 --> 01:32:45,720
It took me a long time to...

2913
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:49,740
去熬过那段痛苦的日子

2914
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:49,740
learn to get through that darkness.

2915
01:32:52,580 --> 01:32:53,980
我想要他死

2916
01:32:52,580 --> 01:32:53,980
I wanna kill him.

2917
01:32:56,750 --> 01:32:58,100
我要把他碎尸万段

2918
01:32:56,750 --> 01:32:58,100
I wanna tear him apart.

2919
01:33:02,150 --> 01:33:04,160
现在我的脑海中还充斥着她的声音

2920
01:33:02,150 --> 01:33:04,160
I can still hear her voice in my head.

2921
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:13,570
即使她已遍体鳞伤 但她仍然告诉我我们做的事是正确的

2922
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:13,570
Even after she was hurt, she said to me that we did the right thing.

2923
01:33:22,970 --> 01:33:24,990
她告诉我能力越大

2924
01:33:22,970 --> 01:33:24,990
She told me that with great power...

2925
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:28,700
责任越大

2926
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:28,700
comes great responsibility.

2927
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:35,500
等会儿 你怎么会知道这个

2928
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:35,500
Wait, what? How do you know that?

2929
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:37,090
本叔叔也说过

2930
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:37,090
Uncle Ben said it.

2931
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:38,540
在他死的那天

2932
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:38,540
The day he died.

2933
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:45,080
也许她并没有死的毫无意义 彼得

2934
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:45,080
Maybe she didn't die for nothing, Peter.

2935
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:56,740
好吧 那…

2936
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:56,740
Okay, so...

2937
01:33:56,870 --> 01:33:59,460
康纳斯 马科 迪龙 还有…

2938
01:33:56,870 --> 01:33:59,460
Connors, Marko, Dillon, and...

2939
01:34:01,090 --> 01:34:05,180
我觉得我们可以帮迪龙和马科把那个设备修好 但其他人…

2940
01:34:01,090 --> 01:34:05,180
Look, I think that I can repair the devices for Dillon and Marko, but the others...

2941
01:34:05,710 --> 01:34:08,560
那把康纳斯交给我 我曾经治好过他一次 小事一桩

2942
01:34:05,710 --> 01:34:08,560
Well, I got Connors. I've already cured him once, so no big deal.

2943
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:11,600
咋了 真是小事一桩

2944
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:11,600
What? It's no big deal.

2945
01:34:11,790 --> 01:34:12,810
那太好了

2946
01:34:11,790 --> 01:34:12,810
Great.

2947
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:14,710
确实

2948
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:14,710
Yeah. That's great.

2949
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:20,470
我想我们可以给奥斯本研发一个血清

2950
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:20,470
I think I can make an antiserum for Doctor Osborn.

2951
01:34:21,170 --> 01:34:23,020
我早就想这样做了

2952
01:34:21,170 --> 01:34:23,020
Been thinking about it a long time.

2953
01:34:26,290 --> 01:34:27,730
必须把他们所有人都治好

2954
01:34:26,290 --> 01:34:27,730
Gotta cure all of them.

2955
01:34:27,930 --> 01:34:28,940
对吧

2956
01:34:27,930 --> 01:34:28,940
Right?

2957
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:31,240
对

2958
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:31,240
Right.

2959
01:34:32,870 --> 01:34:34,380
这是我们应该做的

2960
01:34:32,870 --> 01:34:34,380
That's what we do.

2961
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:43,420
什么

2962
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:43,420
What?

2963
01:34:44,190 --> 01:34:45,940
这是为你们准备的

2964
01:34:44,190 --> 01:34:45,940
It's for yous.

2965
01:35:03,930 --> 01:35:04,930
那…

2966
01:35:03,930 --> 01:35:04,930
So...

2967
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:07,460
你是不是也有个最好的麻吉

2968
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:07,460
Do you have a best friend too?

2969
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,210
有

2970
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,210
I did.

2971
01:35:12,330 --> 01:35:13,550
真有

2972
01:35:12,330 --> 01:35:13,550
You did?

2973
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:16,620
他死在了我怀里

2974
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:16,620
He died in my arms.

2975
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:20,200
之前他甚至还想杀了我

2976
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:20,200
After he tried to kill me.

2977
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:23,640
他的死让我悲痛欲绝

2978
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:23,640
It was heartbreaking.

2979
01:35:34,530 --> 01:35:36,220
做个诊断报告

2980
01:35:34,530 --> 01:35:36,220
Run a diagnostic.

2981
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:37,570
好

2982
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:37,570
Okay.

2983
01:35:47,110 --> 01:35:48,240
嘿 你没事吧

2984
01:35:47,110 --> 01:35:48,240
Hey, you okay?

2985
01:35:49,190 --> 01:35:50,720
我没事

2986
01:35:49,190 --> 01:35:50,720
Yeah, I'm fine.

2987
01:35:55,090 --> 01:35:56,530
你不该遭这个罪的

2988
01:35:55,090 --> 01:35:56,530
You don't deserve this.

2989
01:35:57,950 --> 01:35:59,230
我毁了你的人生

2990
01:35:57,950 --> 01:35:59,230
I ruined your life...

2991
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:00,880
没有 一点也没有

2992
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:00,880
Hey. No, no, no, no, no.

2993
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:04,060
看着我 我陪着你的

2994
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:04,060
Look at me. I'm here.

2995
01:36:05,390 --> 01:36:06,740
我哪儿也不去

2996
01:36:05,390 --> 01:36:06,740
I'm not going anywhere.

2997
01:36:08,130 --> 01:36:11,220
我们要一起共渡难关 同心协力共渡难关

2998
01:36:08,130 --> 01:36:11,220
We're gonna get through this. We're gonna get through it together.

2999
01:36:12,330 --> 01:36:13,340
好吗

3000
01:36:12,330 --> 01:36:13,340
Okay?

3001
01:36:15,050 --> 01:36:16,060
好

3002
01:36:15,050 --> 01:36:16,060
Okay.

3003
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:35,670
你有女朋友吗

3004
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:35,670
You have someone?

3005
01:36:36,530 --> 01:36:37,440
没有

3006
01:36:36,530 --> 01:36:37,440
No.

3007
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:42,110
我没时间做彼得帕克 做自己…

3008
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:42,110
I got no time for Peter Parker stuff...

3009
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:43,460
你懂吗

3010
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:43,460
You know?

3011
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:46,360
你呢

3012
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:46,360
Do you?

3013
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:49,860
有一小小点… 复杂

3014
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:49,860
It's a little... complicated.

3015
01:36:50,530 --> 01:36:51,680
我明白

3016
01:36:50,530 --> 01:36:51,680
I understand.

3017
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,970
我猜我们就不是那种能过上正常人生活的人

3018
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,970
I guess it's just not in the cards for guys like us.

3019
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:55,250
对啊

3020
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:55,250
Well...

3021
01:36:55,830 --> 01:36:57,150
但我没放弃

3022
01:36:55,830 --> 01:36:57,150
I wouldn't give up.

3023
01:36:57,350 --> 01:36:58,700
花了点时间 但是…

3024
01:36:57,350 --> 01:36:58,700
Took a while, but...

3025
01:36:58,950 --> 01:37:00,200
我和她做到了

3026
01:36:58,950 --> 01:37:00,200
We made it work.

3027
01:37:00,290 --> 01:37:01,660
- 成功了 - 对

3028
01:37:00,290 --> 01:37:01,660
- Yeah? - Yeah.

3029
01:37:01,810 --> 01:37:02,920
我和…

3030
01:37:01,810 --> 01:37:02,920
Me and...

3031
01:37:03,390 --> 01:37:04,420
MJ

3032
01:37:03,390 --> 01:37:04,420
MJ.

3033
01:37:06,090 --> 01:37:07,730
我的MJ 她…

3034
01:37:06,090 --> 01:37:07,730
My MJ. She, uhh...

3035
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,570
有点乱 是不是

3036
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,570
It gets confusing, huh?

3037
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:13,780
彼得

3038
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:13,780
Peter?

3039
01:37:13,810 --> 01:37:16,360
- 在 啊 不好意思 你说的是…

3040
01:37:13,810 --> 01:37:16,360
- Yeah? Oh, sorry. You mean...- Yeah? Oh, sorry. You mean...

3041
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:18,400
真正的彼得

3042
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:18,400
Peter-Peter.

3043
01:37:18,430 --> 01:37:20,050
- 我们都是彼得 奈德 - 是吧 彼得

3044
01:37:18,430 --> 01:37:20,050
- We're all called Peter, Ned. - Yeah. Peter?

3045
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:21,110
彼得帕克

3046
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:21,110
Peter Parker?

3047
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:23,180
- 一样 - 我们都是彼得帕克

3048
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:23,180
- Same. - We're all Peter Parker.

3049
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:24,580
那台电脑

3050
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:24,580
The computer!

3051
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:27,720
- 我准备好了 - 我也是

3052
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:27,720
- Oh, I'm ready. - Yeah, me too.

3053
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:32,670
好 现在我们要做的就是把他们引到一个地方

3054
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:32,670
Okay, so... Now, all we gotta do is lure these guys someplace, right?

3055
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:37,800
在他们想杀了我们的同时 治好他们 并把他们送回家

3056
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:37,800
Try to cure them, while they try to kill us, and then, send them home.

3057
01:37:38,020 --> 01:37:39,420
用那个魔法盒子

3058
01:37:38,020 --> 01:37:39,420
Using a magic box?

3059
01:37:39,490 --> 01:37:40,680
对 就是这样计划的

3060
01:37:39,490 --> 01:37:40,680
Well, that's the plan.

3061
01:37:40,770 --> 01:37:42,440
你的战服去哪儿了

3062
01:37:40,770 --> 01:37:42,440
So are you gonna go into battle dressed as a

3063
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:44,890
还是说你就打算穿这身便装去跟他们打

3064
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:44,890
cool, youth pastor, or do you got your suit?

3065
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:47,780
那就好

3066
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:47,780
Good.

3067
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:49,170
你的蛛网弹药盒

3068
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:49,170
Here's your web cartridges.

3069
01:37:49,190 --> 01:37:50,260
谢了 奈德

3070
01:37:49,190 --> 01:37:50,260
Oh, thanks, Ned.

3071
01:37:50,340 --> 01:37:51,540
那是用来干什么的

3072
01:37:50,340 --> 01:37:51,540
What's that for?

3073
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:54,690
里面是蛛网液体 用来填充蛛网发射器的 为什么这么问

3074
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:54,690
It's my web fluid. It's for my web shooters. Why?

3075
01:37:58,140 --> 01:37:59,790
- 你都是直接从你体内射出蛛网来的 - 是啊

3076
01:37:58,140 --> 01:37:59,790
- That came out of you? - Yeah.

3077
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:01,880
- 你做不到 - 做不到

3078
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:01,880
- You can't do that, huh? - No.

3079
01:38:01,910 --> 01:38:03,240
这到底是什么原理…

3080
01:38:01,910 --> 01:38:03,240
How on Earth is that...

3081
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:04,850
总之 我们跑题了

3082
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:04,850
Anyway, we're getting sidetracked. Look, this

3083
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,680
这里是我们的行动地点 这里与世隔绝

3084
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,680
is where we're gonna do this, okay? It's isolated,

3085
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:08,470
就不会有无辜群众受伤了

3086
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:08,470
so no one should get hurt.

3087
01:38:08,990 --> 01:38:11,370
我们用盒子把他们引过去 他们都想要那个盒子

3088
01:38:08,990 --> 01:38:11,370
We draw them there with the box, it's the one thing they all want.

3089
01:38:11,410 --> 01:38:13,280
但我们得先想想该怎么过去

3090
01:38:11,410 --> 01:38:13,280
All we have to do is figure out how we're gonna get there.

3091
01:38:13,310 --> 01:38:14,670
我可以开传送门

3092
01:38:13,310 --> 01:38:14,670
Oh, we can portal there.

3093
01:38:14,690 --> 01:38:15,870
- 什么 - 我现在会魔法了

3094
01:38:14,690 --> 01:38:15,870
- What? - I magic now.

3095
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:17,550
他说的是真的 他确实会

3096
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:17,550
Yeah, no, no. He's right. He can. He can.

3097
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:18,910
- 我看见了 - 确实

3098
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:18,910
- Yeah, we saw him. - Yeah. He is.

3099
01:38:19,650 --> 01:38:21,860
- 真的 - 我真的会奇异博士的魔法了

3100
01:38:19,650 --> 01:38:21,860
- Wait, really? - Dude, I got Doctor Strange magic.

3101
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:22,910
- What? - Yeah!

3102
01:38:23,570 --> 01:38:24,680
还有 我向你保证

3103
01:38:23,570 --> 01:38:24,680
And I promise you...

3104
01:38:24,710 --> 01:38:26,930
我不会变成反派来追杀你的

3105
01:38:24,710 --> 01:38:26,930
I won't turn into a supervillain and try to kill you.

3106
01:38:29,450 --> 01:38:30,460
好吧

3107
01:38:29,450 --> 01:38:30,460
Okay...

3108
01:38:31,470 --> 01:38:32,630
谢了

3109
01:38:31,470 --> 01:38:32,630
Thank you.

3110
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:38,510
Umm...

3111
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:41,250
只能全力以赴了 你之前挂在嘴上那句话是什么来着

3112
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:41,250
Alright. Here goes nothing. What's that thing you always say?

3113
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:43,210
你期待失望…

3114
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:43,210
If you expect disappointment...

3115
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:44,260
不不不

3116
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:44,260
No, no, no...

3117
01:38:45,860 --> 01:38:47,060
我们要揍他们个落花流水

3118
01:38:45,860 --> 01:38:47,060
We gotta kick some ass.

3119
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:48,840
好

3120
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:48,840
Okay.

3121
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:50,230
治

3122
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:50,230
Cure.

3123
01:38:50,650 --> 01:38:51,830
治他们个落花流水

3124
01:38:50,650 --> 01:38:51,830
Cure some ass.

3125
01:38:52,090 --> 01:38:53,320
治他们个落花流水

3126
01:38:52,090 --> 01:38:53,320
Cure that ass.

3127
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,400
女士们先生们

3128
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,400
Ladies and gentlemen...

3129
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:59,160
号角热线刚刚收到来电

3130
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:59,160
The Bugle tip line has just received a call

3131
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:02,610
是逃犯蜘蛛侠的来电

3132
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:02,610
from none other than the fugitive known as Spider-Man.

3133
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:05,200
在皇后区惨案不久后

3134
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:05,200
Fresh from his rampage in Queens.

3135
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:10,230
彼得帕克 这次你又在兜售什么有害的宣传

3136
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:10,230
So, Peter Parker... What pernicious propaganda are you peddling?

3137
01:39:10,290 --> 01:39:12,170
- 真相 - 当然

3138
01:39:10,290 --> 01:39:12,170
- Just the truth. - Oh, sure.

3139
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:13,440
真相是…

3140
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:13,440
Truth is...

3141
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:16,490
这些事全是我的错

3142
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:16,490
That this is all my fault.

3143
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:19,420
我意外地把那些坏人带到这里

3144
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:19,420
I accidentally brought those dangerous people here.

3145
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:21,040
他居然承认了

3146
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:21,040
Well, he admits it!

3147
01:39:21,210 --> 01:39:22,750
如果你们在看的话

3148
01:39:21,210 --> 01:39:22,750
And if those people are watching...

3149
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:26,850
我只想你们知道 我是真心想帮助你们

3150
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:26,850
Just know that I really did try to help you.

3151
01:39:28,250 --> 01:39:29,490
我本可以杀了你们的

3152
01:39:28,250 --> 01:39:29,490
I could've killed you.

3153
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:33,030
任何时刻都可以 但我没有

3154
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:33,030
At any given moment, but I didn't.

3155
01:39:35,330 --> 01:39:37,900
因为我的梅姨告诉我 每个人都值得有第二次机会

3156
01:39:35,330 --> 01:39:37,900
Because my Aunt May taught me that everyone deserves a second chance.

3157
01:39:38,610 --> 01:39:39,670
这也是我来这的原因

3158
01:39:38,610 --> 01:39:39,670
And that's why I'm here.

3159
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:41,540
你要问这是哪儿

3160
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:41,540
And where is here, exactly?

3161
01:39:43,470 --> 01:39:45,480
一个代表第二次机会的地方

3162
01:39:43,470 --> 01:39:45,480
A place that represents second chances.

3163
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:50,950
自由女神像 我的天 他…

3164
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:50,950
The Statue of Liberty? Good God, folks! He's

3165
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:54,130
又有一处国家地标建筑要毁在他手里了

3166
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:54,130
about to destroy another national landmark.

3167
01:39:54,490 --> 01:39:56,110
全世界的观众们 如果你在看的话…

3168
01:39:54,490 --> 01:39:56,110
The world, if you're watching...

3169
01:39:56,130 --> 01:39:57,800
相信我 全世界的观众都在看

3170
01:39:56,130 --> 01:39:57,800
Believe me, the world is watching.

3171
01:39:58,990 --> 01:40:00,160
祝我好运

3172
01:39:58,990 --> 01:40:00,160
Wish me luck.

3173
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:04,320
你的好邻居蜘蛛侠真的需要点好运

3174
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:04,320
Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man could really use some.

3175
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:13,010
好了 伙计们 他们随时都会来

3176
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:13,010
Okay, guys. It could be any minute now.

3177
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:15,110
马上好了

3178
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:15,110
Yup. Almost done.

3179
01:40:20,110 --> 01:40:25,190
你们知道吗 在麦克斯掉入电鳗池之前

3180
01:40:20,110 --> 01:40:25,190
You know, Max was like,the sweetest guy ever.

3181
01:40:25,310 --> 01:40:26,570
他是我遇到过的

3182
01:40:25,310 --> 01:40:26,570
Before he fell into a...

3183
01:40:27,580 --> 01:40:29,000
最贴心最好的人

3184
01:40:27,580 --> 01:40:29,000
pool of electric eels.

3185
01:40:29,330 --> 01:40:30,340
怪不得

3186
01:40:29,330 --> 01:40:30,340
That'll do it.

3187
01:40:32,990 --> 01:40:34,360
又来了...

3188
01:40:32,990 --> 01:40:34,360
There it goes...

3189
01:40:36,940 --> 01:40:38,140
你还好吗

3190
01:40:36,940 --> 01:40:38,140
You okay?

3191
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:39,500
我的背

3192
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:39,500
My back.

3193
01:40:39,570 --> 01:40:42,600
我猜是蛛丝荡多了搞得有点僵硬了

3194
01:40:39,570 --> 01:40:42,600
It's kind of stiff from all the swinging, I guess.

3195
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:44,450
对噢 我的背也会疼

3196
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:44,450
Oh, yeah, no, I got a middle back pain, too.

3197
01:40:44,490 --> 01:40:45,710
- 真的 - 是啊

3198
01:40:44,490 --> 01:40:45,710
- Really? - Yeah.

3199
01:40:46,270 --> 01:40:47,680
你想开个背吗

3200
01:40:46,270 --> 01:40:47,680
You want me to crack it?

3201
01:40:48,670 --> 01:40:49,680
Yeah.

3202
01:40:49,950 --> 01:40:51,280
那可太好了

3203
01:40:49,950 --> 01:40:51,280
That would be great.

3204
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:53,340
准备好了没

3205
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:53,340
You ready?

3206
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:54,010
Yeah.

3207
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:59,040
真舒服

3208
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:59,040
That's good.

3209
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:00,900
如何

3210
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:00,900
How is it?

3211
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:01,940
Wow.

3212
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:04,290
- 太爽了 - 是吧

3213
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:04,290
- That's good. - Right?

3214
01:41:04,340 --> 01:41:05,350
- 我感觉好多了 - 那就行

3215
01:41:04,340 --> 01:41:05,350
- That's better. - Yeah.

3216
01:41:05,430 --> 01:41:06,450
Wow.

3217
01:41:09,890 --> 01:41:11,180
天啊 这真的太酷了

3218
01:41:09,890 --> 01:41:11,180
God, this is so cool.

3219
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:12,790
我一直都想拥有几个兄弟

3220
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:12,790
I always wanted brothers.

3221
01:41:14,420 --> 01:41:17,420
所以你的体内能自然产生蛛网液体

3222
01:41:14,420 --> 01:41:17,420
So you could like make your own web fluid in your body?

3223
01:41:17,540 --> 01:41:19,280
我不想谈这个

3224
01:41:17,540 --> 01:41:19,280
I'd rather not talk about this.

3225
01:41:19,330 --> 01:41:20,600
我不是故意的…

3226
01:41:19,330 --> 01:41:20,600
No, I don't mean to...

3227
01:41:20,630 --> 01:41:22,060
- 你拿我寻开心是不是 - 没有没有 绝对没有

3228
01:41:20,630 --> 01:41:22,060
- Are you teasing me? - No, no, no. No, no, no.

3229
01:41:22,130 --> 01:41:23,600
他没有逗你 只是…

3230
01:41:22,130 --> 01:41:23,600
He's not teasing you. It's just that...

3231
01:41:24,420 --> 01:41:28,250
我们做不到 所以我们真的很好奇你的网是怎么射出来的

3232
01:41:24,420 --> 01:41:28,250
We can't do that, so naturally we're curious as to how your web situation works.

3233
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:29,100
仅此而已

3234
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:29,100
That's all.

3235
01:41:29,130 --> 01:41:31,030
我不想侵犯你的隐私 我只是觉得很酷

3236
01:41:29,130 --> 01:41:31,030
If it's personal, I don't wanna pry. I just think it's cool.

3237
01:41:31,050 --> 01:41:34,660
我很乐意告诉你 但我不知道怎么形容…

3238
01:41:31,050 --> 01:41:34,660
No. I wish I could tell you, but it's like, I don't do it...

3239
01:41:34,690 --> 01:41:35,690
就像…

3240
01:41:34,690 --> 01:41:35,690
Like I don't...

3241
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:38,490
就像我不会故意去呼吸 但我一直都在呼吸

3242
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:38,490
Like, I don't do breathing. Like, breathing just happens.

3243
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:39,130
Whoa.

3244
01:41:39,150 --> 01:41:41,520
那是不是 蛛网直接从你手腕射出来

3245
01:41:39,150 --> 01:41:41,520
Like, does it just come out of your wrists, or...

3246
01:41:41,990 --> 01:41:43,840
还是哪儿都可以射出来

3247
01:41:41,990 --> 01:41:43,840
Does it come out off anywhere else?

3248
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:45,580
只有手腕能

3249
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:45,580
Only... only the wrists.

3250
01:41:45,630 --> 01:41:48,130
你的蛛网都用不完的吗 我的蛛网总是不够用

3251
01:41:45,630 --> 01:41:48,130
You never had to web block? Cause I run out of webs all the time.

3252
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:50,050
所以我不得不为此建了一个实验室

3253
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:50,050
I had to make my own lab.

3254
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:52,100
真的很麻烦

3255
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:52,100
And it's a hassle.

3256
01:41:52,130 --> 01:41:53,840
光听上去都很麻烦

3257
01:41:52,130 --> 01:41:53,840
That sounds like a hassle.

3258
01:41:53,860 --> 01:41:56,370
其实 事实上 就像你们说的

3259
01:41:53,860 --> 01:41:56,370
But I did, actually, as you said that. I was like...

3260
01:41:56,550 --> 01:41:58,350
- 我的蛛网也曾用完过 - 为什么

3261
01:41:56,550 --> 01:41:58,350
- I had a web block. - Why?

3262
01:41:58,610 --> 01:42:00,520
自我认知出了点问题

3263
01:41:58,610 --> 01:42:00,520
Existential crisis stuff.

3264
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:02,070
好了 我不想再说了

3265
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:02,070
Yeah, don't get me started on that.

3266
01:42:02,090 --> 01:42:03,090
Hey....

3267
01:42:03,330 --> 01:42:06,300
那你们遇到过的最疯狂的反派是什么

3268
01:42:03,330 --> 01:42:06,300
What are like, some of the craziest villains that you guys have fought?

3269
01:42:06,450 --> 01:42:08,240
你好像已经见过他们了

3270
01:42:06,450 --> 01:42:08,240
Seems you've met some of them.

3271
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:09,820
好问题

3272
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:09,820
That's a good question.

3273
01:42:09,890 --> 01:42:10,950
我曾经…

3274
01:42:09,890 --> 01:42:10,950
I fought a...

3275
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:12,390
打过一个…

3276
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:12,390
an alien...

3277
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:14,720
黑色粘液形态的外星生物

3278
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:14,720
made out of black goo once.

3279
01:42:14,790 --> 01:42:16,860
不是吧 我也打过外星生物

3280
01:42:14,790 --> 01:42:16,860
No way! I fought an alien, too.

3281
01:42:16,950 --> 01:42:18,210
地球上和太空中都打过

3282
01:42:16,950 --> 01:42:18,210
On Earth and in space.

3283
01:42:18,250 --> 01:42:19,260
- 噢 - 是个紫色外星人

3284
01:42:18,250 --> 01:42:19,260
- Oh. - Yeah. He was purple.

3285
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:20,550
我也想跟外星生物打一场

3286
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:20,550
I wanna fight an alien.

3287
01:42:20,570 --> 01:42:22,110
因为我还没…

3288
01:42:20,570 --> 01:42:22,110
I'm, I'm still, like...

3289
01:42:22,150 --> 01:42:24,300
我很惊讶你也打过外星人的 还是在太空里

3290
01:42:22,150 --> 01:42:24,300
That you fought an alien, in Space.

3291
01:42:25,070 --> 01:42:26,070
相比之下我就逊爆了

3292
01:42:25,070 --> 01:42:26,070
I'm lame.

3293
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:28,040
我曾经打过一个…

3294
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:28,040
Like, I fought a Russian guy in a...

3295
01:42:28,310 --> 01:42:29,890
驾驶着巨型犀牛机甲的俄罗斯人

3296
01:42:28,310 --> 01:42:29,890
Like a rhinoceros machine.

3297
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:32,330
能不能谈回“我很逊”这个话题

3298
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:32,330
Hey, can we rewind it back to the "I'm lame" part?

3299
01:42:32,350 --> 01:42:33,540
老实说 你一点也不逊

3300
01:42:32,350 --> 01:42:33,540
'Cause, you are not.

3301
01:42:33,570 --> 01:42:35,910
谢谢你 真的 我没事 我没说我很逊

3302
01:42:33,570 --> 01:42:35,910
Aw, thanks. No, yeah. I appreciate it, I'm not saying I'm lame.

3303
01:42:35,930 --> 01:42:37,940
只是自言自语而已

3304
01:42:35,930 --> 01:42:37,940
But it's just the self-talk maybe we should, you know...

3305
01:42:37,970 --> 01:42:39,140
- 听着 - 拜托

3306
01:42:37,970 --> 01:42:39,140
- Yeah, listen... - Please...

3307
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:40,960
我觉得你很神奇

3308
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:40,960
You're... You're Amazing.

3309
01:42:41,150 --> 01:42:42,750
你吸收一下

3310
01:42:41,150 --> 01:42:42,750
Just to take it in for a minute.

3311
01:42:42,780 --> 01:42:45,300
- 行行行 - 你真的很神奇

3312
01:42:42,780 --> 01:42:45,300
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You... You are amazing.

3313
01:42:45,370 --> 01:42:46,650
- 应该吧 - 你真的很超凡

3314
01:42:45,370 --> 01:42:46,650
- I guess I am. - You are amazing.

3315
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:48,040
- 谢谢 - 你能说一遍吗

3316
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:48,040
- Thank you. - Will you say it?

3317
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:49,790
不 我其实挺需要点鼓励的 谢谢你

3318
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:49,790
No, I kinda needed to hear that. Thank you.

3319
01:42:50,690 --> 01:42:53,120
好了伙计们 专心点 你们感觉到了吗

3320
01:42:50,690 --> 01:42:53,120
Alright guys, focus up. Can you feel that?

3321
01:42:53,170 --> 01:42:54,050
Yeah.

3322
01:43:01,710 --> 01:43:02,900
过得如何 彼得

3323
01:43:01,710 --> 01:43:02,900
What's up, Peter?

3324
01:43:05,570 --> 01:43:07,350
你觉得这个新消息怎么样

3325
01:43:05,570 --> 01:43:07,350
How do you like the new news?

3326
01:43:08,370 --> 01:43:12,570
你把那个盒子给我 让我毁了它

3327
01:43:08,370 --> 01:43:12,570
Look, you give it to me, I'm gonna destroy it.

3328
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:14,990
我就放你一马

3329
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:14,990
But I'll let you live.

3330
01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:17,760
不要逼我下杀手 彼得

3331
01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:17,760
Don't make me a murderer, Peter.

3332
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,740
好了 他们来了

3333
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,740
Okay, guys. Here it comes.

3334
01:43:28,190 --> 01:43:29,430
嗨 麦克斯

3335
01:43:28,190 --> 01:43:29,430
Hey, Max!

3336
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:31,130
我可想你死你了

3337
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:31,130
I missed you, man!

3338
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:35,590
MJ 当心点

3339
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:35,590
All right, MJ, heads up!

3340
01:43:36,620 --> 01:43:38,050
明白了 把传送门关了

3341
01:43:36,620 --> 01:43:38,050
Got it! Close it.

3342
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:43,860
- 这… - 我知道

3343
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:43,860
- Okay... - I know.

3344
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:45,570
- 为什么关不掉 - 我不知道 我…

3345
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:45,570
- Why isn't it closing? - I don't know... I...

3346
01:43:45,620 --> 01:43:47,160
你之前没关过吗

3347
01:43:45,620 --> 01:43:47,160
Have you closed before? No?

3348
01:43:47,190 --> 01:43:49,320
没有啊 我只开过

3349
01:43:47,190 --> 01:43:49,320
No. I mean I have opened some.

3350
01:43:57,400 --> 01:44:00,620
亲爱的麦克斯 我们好好的谈谈如何 就我俩

3351
01:43:57,400 --> 01:44:00,620
Max, Max, Max. Can we just talk for a second? Just you and me, just...

3352
01:44:00,830 --> 01:44:04,100
看看谁来了 我们的老朋友蜘蛛侠

3353
01:44:00,830 --> 01:44:04,100
Look who showed up! Our old friend Spider-Man.

3354
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:06,310
我本来想救你的

3355
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:06,310
I'm trying to save you, Max. That's all I've ever wanted.

3356
01:44:06,370 --> 01:44:08,100
- 你从来没想过要救我 - 我有

3357
01:44:06,370 --> 01:44:08,100
- You're not trying to save me. - I am.

3358
01:44:08,150 --> 01:44:10,070
你现在对我来说屁都不是

3359
01:44:08,150 --> 01:44:10,070
You ain't even shit no more.

3360
01:44:10,550 --> 01:44:13,680
不用你担心 我不需要你来拯救

3361
01:44:10,550 --> 01:44:13,680
Don't worry about me. I'll save myself.

3362
01:44:16,740 --> 01:44:18,680
我吸引他的注意力了 然后呢

3363
01:44:16,740 --> 01:44:18,680
I got his attention, now what?

3364
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:20,330
打开笼子

3365
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:20,330
Open the cage!

3366
01:44:20,940 --> 01:44:23,150
那个蜥蜴人也在这

3367
01:44:20,940 --> 01:44:23,150
Just FYI, Lizard-guy is here too.

3368
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:27,060
伙计们 检查通讯 哈咯

3369
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:27,060
Guys, comm check, hello.

3370
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:29,270
我需要麦克斯的解药

3371
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:29,270
I need Max's cure.

3372
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:30,860
马上来

3373
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:30,860
Yeah. I'm on it.

3374
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:33,300
彼得 我需要蜥蜴人的解药

3375
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:33,300
Peter! I need the Lizard cure.

3376
01:44:33,390 --> 01:44:34,860
马上 马上

3377
01:44:33,390 --> 01:44:34,860
Okay! Okay!

3378
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:41,750
盒子哪儿去了 彼得

3379
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:41,750
Where's the box, Peter?

3380
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:44,360
- 弗林特 我们可以帮助你们所有人 - 我才不在乎

3381
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:44,360
- Flint! We can help everyone. - I don't care!

3382
01:44:56,190 --> 01:44:57,230
抱歉

3383
01:44:56,190 --> 01:44:57,230
Sorry!

3384
01:44:59,350 --> 01:45:02,410
我跟你说过了 沙人 我们都回不去了

3385
01:44:59,350 --> 01:45:02,410
I tried to tell you, Sandman. Nobody's going home.

3386
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:43,430
刚刚他么的发生了什么

3387
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:43,430
What the hell, is going on out there?

3388
01:45:43,470 --> 01:45:45,180
我一直在叫你 彼得2号彼得2号

3389
01:45:43,470 --> 01:45:45,180
I kept yelling at you, Peter 2, Peter 2...

3390
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:46,920
我听见了 但我以为你才是彼得2号

3391
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:46,920
I know, but I thought you're Peter 2?

3392
01:45:46,950 --> 01:45:48,350
什么 我不是彼得2号…

3393
01:45:46,950 --> 01:45:48,350
What? I'm not Peter...

3394
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:50,150
你们俩别吵了 都听彼得1号的

3395
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:50,150
Stop arguing, both of you! Listen to Peter 1.

3396
01:45:50,290 --> 01:45:52,350
很明显我们很不擅长团队合作

3397
01:45:50,290 --> 01:45:52,350
Look, we're clearly not very good at this!

3398
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:53,830
我知道我知道 糟透了

3399
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:53,830
I know, I know. We suck.

3400
01:45:53,860 --> 01:45:55,780
我真的不知道该怎么与人合作

3401
01:45:53,860 --> 01:45:55,780
I, I don't know how to work as a team.

3402
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:56,770
我也是

3403
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:56,770
Me neither.

3404
01:45:56,820 --> 01:45:58,700
我知道 我在团队里待过

3405
01:45:56,820 --> 01:45:58,700
Well I do. I have been in a team, okay?

3406
01:45:58,730 --> 01:46:00,470
我不想自吹自擂 但我真的待过

3407
01:45:58,730 --> 01:46:00,470
I don't wanna brag, but I will.

3408
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:02,270
- 我曾经在复仇者联盟待过 - 复仇者联盟

3409
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:02,270
- I was in the Avengers. - The Avengers?

3410
01:46:02,330 --> 01:46:03,640
- 对 - 那可太棒了

3411
01:46:02,330 --> 01:46:03,640
- Yeah. - That's great!

3412
01:46:03,670 --> 01:46:05,550
- 谢谢 - 复联是什么

3413
01:46:03,670 --> 01:46:05,550
- Thank you. - What is that?

3414
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:07,580
等等 你们的世界没有复联

3415
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:07,580
Wait, you don't have the Avengers?

3416
01:46:07,650 --> 01:46:09,170
是乐队吗 你玩乐队

3417
01:46:07,650 --> 01:46:09,170
Is that a band? Are you in a band?

3418
01:46:09,250 --> 01:46:11,410
不 不是乐队

3419
01:46:09,250 --> 01:46:11,410
No, I'm not in a band. No, the Avengers is a...

3420
01:46:11,490 --> 01:46:13,270
- 复联是地球上最强大的… - 有什么用

3421
01:46:11,490 --> 01:46:13,270
- Earth's Mightiest... - How is this helping?!

3422
01:46:13,290 --> 01:46:16,430
好吧 那不重要 重要的是我们得专注 相信你的直觉

3423
01:46:13,290 --> 01:46:16,430
Look, it's not important. All we gotta do is focus, trust your tingle,

3424
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:18,010
彼此打好配合 好吗

3425
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:18,010
and coordinate our attacks, okay?

3426
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:20,720
先选好一个目标

3427
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:20,720
Yes. Okay. Let's pick one target.

3428
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:21,540
Right.

3429
01:46:21,570 --> 01:46:23,160
我们一个一个的解决他们

3430
01:46:21,570 --> 01:46:23,160
We take them off the board one at a time.

3431
01:46:23,190 --> 01:46:24,340

弗林特 我们是想帮助你

3460
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:43,700
Flint! We're trying to help you!

3461
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:46,990
伙计们 我到顶部了

3462
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:46,990

01:48:37,150 --> 01:48:38,600
没事了 弗林特

3470
01:48:37,150 --> 01:48:38,600
It's okay, Flint.

3471
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:42,080
我们会送你回家的

3472
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:42,080
We're gonna get you home.

3473
01:48:42,890 --> 01:48:45,510
先…待着别乱跑

3474
01:48:42,890 --> 01:48:45,510
Just... stay right here.

3475
01:48:50,250 --> 01:48:52,260
我们该怎么阻止他 我从来没见过他这么这么强大过

3476
01:48:50,250 --> 01:48:52,260
How do we stop him? I've never seen him this powerful.

3477
01:48:52,290 --> 01:48:54,390
是方舟反应器 我们得从他身上把它摘下来

3478
01:48:52,290 --> 01:48:54,390
It's the arc reactor. We gotta get it off him.

3479
01:48:54,570 --> 01:48:56,420
你们别想从我身上夺走它

3480
01:48:54,570 --> 01:48:56,420
You're not gonna take this away from me.

3481
01:48:59,070 --> 01:49:00,400
行不通的

3482
01:48:59,070 --> 01:49:00,400
That's not gonna work.

3483
01:49:05,430 --> 01:49:07,150
好吧 看来我们得一起靠近他

3484
01:49:05,430 --> 01:49:07,150
Okay, we've gotta do this up close.

3485
01:49:07,250 --> 01:49:10,140
彼得2号打右路 彼得三号跟我打左路

3486
01:49:07,250 --> 01:49:10,140
Peter 2 go right, Peter 3 go left. On me.

3487
01:49:40,490 --> 01:49:43,670
没事 我们再试一次 不要放弃

3488
01:49:40,490 --> 01:49:43,670
All right, we're gonna do it again. We're just gonna keep trying.

3489
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:45,740
我们能行 我能行

3490
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:45,740
Alright. We got it. I got it. Got this.

3491
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:47,380
关闭传送门

3492
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:47,380
Close the portal.

3493
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:51,790
噢 不不 不好

3494
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:51,790
Oh, no. No, no, no!

3495
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:54,330
奈德 那是蜥蜴人 我们应该…

3496
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:54,330
Ned, that is a lizard, and we should...

3497
01:49:59,030 --> 01:49:59,890
快跑

3498
01:49:59,030 --> 01:49:59,890
Run!

3499
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:04,980
康纳斯 站住

3500
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:04,980
Connors, stop!

3501
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:14,730
Yeah.

3502
01:50:27,430 --> 01:50:29,870
别管他们 他们是我的

3503
01:50:27,430 --> 01:50:29,870
Leave them. They're mine.

3504
01:50:30,390 --> 01:50:33,030
我不需要你的帮助 我自己能行

3505
01:50:30,390 --> 01:50:33,030
I don't need your help. I got it just fine.

3506
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:35,330
章鱼博士 不要

3507
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:35,330
Dr. Octavius. No.

3508
01:50:37,510 --> 01:50:38,980
你在干什么

3509
01:50:37,510 --> 01:50:38,980
What are you doing?

3510
01:50:40,430 --> 01:50:41,690
放开我

3511
01:50:40,430 --> 01:50:41,690
Get it off me!

3512
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:54,290
轻轻松松

3513
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:54,290
There you go.

3514
01:51:13,370 --> 01:51:14,560
MJ!

3515
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,450
- Okay. Right, right, right.

3516
01:51:37,580 --> 01:51:39,050
他去哪儿了

3517
01:51:37,580 --> 01:51:39,050
Where is he?

3518
01:51:39,890 --> 01:51:40,480
等等

3519
01:51:39,890 --> 01:51:40,480
Wait, wait, wait!

3520
01:51:40,510 --> 01:51:43,120
先生 奇异博士 在你动手之前

3521
01:51:40,510 --> 01:51:43,120
Before you do anything, Mister--- Doctor Strange, sir, well...

3522
01:51:43,330 --> 01:51:44,470
彼得的计划奏效了

3523
01:51:43,330 --> 01:51:44,470
Peter's plan is working.

3524
01:51:44,780 --> 01:51:46,540
- 什么计划 - 他在治愈他们

3525
01:51:44,780 --> 01:51:46,540
- What plan? - He's curing them.

3526
01:51:55,530 --> 01:51:56,660
康纳斯博士

3527
01:51:55,530 --> 01:51:56,660
Dr. Connors?

3528
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:01,060
欢迎回来 先生

3529
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:01,060
Welcome back, sir.

3530
01:52:03,010 --> 01:52:04,410
真是活见鬼了

3531
01:52:03,010 --> 01:52:04,410
Well, I'll be damned.

3532
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:08,960
你刚刚是不是开了扇传送门

3533
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:08,960
Did you just open a portal?

3534
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:11,150
是的 先生 确实是我

3535
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:11,150
Yes, yes, sir. I did.

3536
01:52:19,270 --> 01:52:20,250
麦克斯

3537
01:52:19,270 --> 01:52:20,250
Max.

3538
01:52:21,370 --> 01:52:22,380
麦克斯

3539
01:52:21,370 --> 01:52:22,380
Max...

3540
01:52:22,820 --> 01:52:23,830
没事了

3541
01:52:22,820 --> 01:52:23,830
Don't worry.

3542
01:52:24,130 --> 01:52:26,380
- 我没电了 被抽的一干二净 - 你确定

3543
01:52:24,130 --> 01:52:26,380
- I'm out. Empty. - You sure about that?

3544
01:52:27,820 --> 01:52:29,260
我又变回一个无名小卒了

3545
01:52:27,820 --> 01:52:29,260
I'm back to being a nobody.

3546
01:52:29,530 --> 01:52:32,570
- 你从来都不是无名小卒 麦克斯 - 不 我是 我是

3547
01:52:29,530 --> 01:52:32,570
- You were never a nobody, Max. - Yes, I was. Yes, I was.

3548
01:52:33,120 --> 01:52:34,130
这样说那我也算无名小卒

3549
01:52:33,120 --> 01:52:34,130
You don't see me.

3550
01:52:35,790 --> 01:52:37,120
我能跟你说件事吗

3551
01:52:35,790 --> 01:52:37,120
Can I tell you something?

3552
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:38,550
Yeah.

3553
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:41,630
你长得挺帅的 像个小孩一样

3554
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:41,630
You got a nice face. You're just a kid.

3555
01:52:42,150 --> 01:52:43,650
你来自皇后区

3556
01:52:42,150 --> 01:52:43,650
You're from Queens...

3557
01:52:44,790 --> 01:52:46,120
你有战袍

3558
01:52:44,790 --> 01:52:46,120
You got that suit...

3559
01:52:46,230 --> 01:52:47,670
你帮助他人

3560
01:52:46,230 --> 01:52:47,670
You helping out people...

3561
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:49,890
我以为你会是个黑人

3562
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:49,890
I just thought you was gonna be black.

3563
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:52,760
很抱歉 我不是

3564
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:52,760
Oh, man. I'm sorry.

3565
01:52:53,090 --> 01:52:56,040
别在意 我想在其他宇宙肯定也有黑人蜘蛛侠

3566
01:52:53,090 --> 01:52:56,040
Don't mind it. There's gotta be a black Spider-Man somehwere out there.

3567
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:01,340
该死的电鳗

3568
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:01,340
Goddamn eels.

3569
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:06,310
太阳的能量

3570
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:06,310
The power of the sun...

3571
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:11,320
尽在我掌中

3572
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:11,320
... in the palm of your hand.

3573
01:53:11,570 --> 01:53:12,670
彼得

3574
01:53:11,570 --> 01:53:12,670
Peter?

3575
01:53:14,660 --> 01:53:15,710
奥托

3576
01:53:14,660 --> 01:53:15,710
Otto.

3577
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:19,440
很高兴见到你 小伙子

3578
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:19,440
Oh, it's good to see you, dear boy.

3579
01:53:20,260 --> 01:53:22,030
我也是

3580
01:53:20,260 --> 01:53:22,030
It's good to see you.

3581
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:23,810
你都已经这个年纪了

3582
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:23,810
You're all grown up.

3583
01:53:24,740 --> 01:53:26,240
你过得如何

3584
01:53:24,740 --> 01:53:26,240
How are you?

3585
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:29,890
努力变得更好

3586
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:29,890
Trying to do better.

3587
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:38,480
斯特兰奇 慢着

3588
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:38,480
Strange, wait...

3589
01:53:39,420 --> 01:53:42,040
我被你吊在大峡谷晃了快十二个小时

3590
01:53:39,420 --> 01:53:42,040
I've been dangling over the Grand Canyon for twelve hours!

3591
01:53:42,060 --> 01:53:44,210
我知道 我知道

3592
01:53:42,060 --> 01:53:44,210
I know. I know, I know, I know. I...

3593
01:53:45,470 --> 01:53:47,430
我非常抱歉 先生

3594
01:53:45,470 --> 01:53:47,430
I'm sorry about that, sir. I mean...

3595
01:53:48,190 --> 01:53:49,610
你去大峡谷了

3596
01:53:48,190 --> 01:53:49,610
You went to the Grand Canyon?

3597
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:51,910
- 你本来可以帮他的 - 不 没事的 没事的

3598
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:51,910
- He could've used your help. - No, no. It's okay, it's okay.

3599
01:53:51,990 --> 01:53:53,660
见见我的新朋友 这是彼得帕克

3600
01:53:51,990 --> 01:53:53,660
These are my new friends. This is Peter Parker,

3601
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:55,410
这也是彼得帕克 蜘蛛侠 蜘蛛侠

3602
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:55,410
he's Peter Parker. Spider-Man, Spider-Man.

3603
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:57,980
他们都是从其他宇宙来帮忙的

3604
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:57,980
They're mes from other universes. They're here to help.

3605
01:53:58,160 --> 01:53:59,780
这位就是我跟你们提到过的巫师

3606
01:53:58,160 --> 01:53:59,780
This is the wizard that I was telling you about.

3607
01:53:59,810 --> 01:54:03,590
听着 我觉得你愿意给他们第二次机会真的让我印象深刻

3608
01:53:59,810 --> 01:54:03,590
Look, I am really impressed that you managed to give them all a second chance, kid.

3609
01:54:04,710 --> 01:54:06,710
但现在该做个了结了

3610
01:54:04,710 --> 01:54:06,710
But this has to end, now.

3611
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:10,060
蜘蛛侠愿意出来跟我玩玩吗

3612
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:10,060
Can the Spider-Man come out to play?

3613
01:54:32,380 --> 01:54:33,220
斯特兰奇 不要

3614
01:54:32,380 --> 01:54:33,220
Strange, no!

3615
01:55:04,060 --> 01:55:05,200
你还好吗

3616
01:55:04,060 --> 01:55:05,200
Are you okay?

3617
01:55:05,900 --> 01:55:08,150
我还好

3618
01:55:05,900 --> 01:55:08,150
Yeah. I'm okay.

3619
01:55:11,580 --> 01:55:12,720
你还好吗

3620
01:55:11,580 --> 01:55:12,720
Are you okay?

3621
01:56:29,810 --> 01:56:31,390
谢谢你 斗篷先生 谢谢

3622
01:56:29,810 --> 01:56:31,390
Thank you, Mister Cape, sir.

3623
01:56:34,590 --> 01:56:35,600
奈德

3624
01:56:34,590 --> 01:56:35,600
Ned!

3625
01:56:42,730 --> 01:56:43,740
MJ!

3626
01:56:44,010 --> 01:56:44,880
彼得

3627
01:56:44,010 --> 01:56:44,880
Peter?

3628
01:56:44,910 --> 01:56:47,180
- 奈德 - 彼得

3629
01:56:44,910 --> 01:56:47,180
- Ned! - Peter?

3630
01:56:47,490 --> 01:56:48,400
Hey.

3631
01:56:48,830 --> 01:56:50,570
- 你们还好吗 - 还好

3632
01:56:48,830 --> 01:56:50,570
- Are you okay? - We're okay.

3633
01:57:05,080 --> 01:57:06,180
可怜的彼得

3634
01:57:05,080 --> 01:57:06,180
Poor Peter.

3635
01:57:07,190 --> 01:57:10,300
懦弱至极 都没胆送我去死

3636
01:57:07,190 --> 01:57:10,300
Too weak to send me home to die.

3637
01:57:11,390 --> 01:57:13,090
那我就只好送你去死

3638
01:57:11,390 --> 01:57:13,090
I just wanna kill you myself.

3639
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,100
Attaboy.

3640
01:59:04,930 --> 01:59:06,660
当时她在那儿

3641
01:59:04,930 --> 01:59:06,660
She was there.

3642
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:08,810
这是不是意味着...

3643
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:08,810
It doesn't mean...

3644
01:59:09,470 --> 01:59:11,930
我对她下手了

3645
01:59:09,470 --> 01:59:11,930
I may have struck the blow.

3646
01:59:12,610 --> 01:59:13,840
那你呢

3647
01:59:12,610 --> 01:59:13,840
But you?

3648
01:59:17,590 --> 01:59:20,420
你才是害死她的凶手

3649
01:59:17,590 --> 01:59:20,420
You are the one that killed her.

3650
01:59:47,850 --> 01:59:48,860
彼得

3651
01:59:47,850 --> 01:59:48,860
Peter?

3652
02:00:02,150 --> 02:00:03,460
我到底做了什么

3653
02:00:02,150 --> 02:00:03,460
What have I done?

3654
02:00:07,830 --> 02:00:09,250
- 是你 - 你没事吧

3655
02:00:07,830 --> 02:00:09,250
- It's you. - You okay?

3656
02:00:10,710 --> 02:00:12,840
我没事 但我有过这种经历

3657
02:00:10,710 --> 02:00:12,840
Yeah, I'm good. I've been stabbed before.

3658
02:00:13,030 --> 02:00:14,030
Hey.

3659
02:00:15,550 --> 02:00:16,810
接的不错

3660
02:00:15,550 --> 02:00:16,810
Hey, nice catch.

3661
02:00:17,550 --> 02:00:18,820
你看见没

3662
02:00:17,550 --> 02:00:18,820
You saw?

3663
02:00:22,770 --> 02:00:24,740
这是真的吗 还是我快死了

3664
02:00:22,770 --> 02:00:24,740
Is that happening? Or am I dying?

3665
02:00:36,130 --> 02:00:38,140
- 我得走了 - 我能搞定

3666
02:00:36,130 --> 02:00:38,140
- I gotta go. - Yeah. Yeah, I got him.

3667
02:00:42,980 --> 02:00:44,380
发生什么了

3668
02:00:42,980 --> 02:00:44,380
What's happening?

3669
02:00:44,570 --> 02:00:46,530
他们开始不断的传送过来 我挡不住了

3670
02:00:44,570 --> 02:00:46,530
They're starting to come through and I can't stop them.

3671
02:00:46,550 --> 02:00:49,580
一定有办法的 你能不能再施个咒

3672
02:00:46,550 --> 02:00:49,580
There's got to be something we can do. Can't you just cast a spell again?

3673
02:00:49,810 --> 02:00:51,700
就像我搞砸那次一样

3674
02:00:49,810 --> 02:00:51,700
Like the original way. Before I screwed it up.

3675
02:00:51,730 --> 02:00:53,450
太迟了 他们已经到了

3676
02:00:51,730 --> 02:00:53,450
We're too late for that. They're here.

3677
02:00:54,890 --> 02:00:56,660
他们全是冲你来的

3678
02:00:54,890 --> 02:00:56,660
They're here because of you.

3679
02:01:01,790 --> 02:01:03,630
那如果让所有人都忘记我呢

3680
02:01:01,790 --> 02:01:03,630
What if everyone forgot who I was?

3681
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:04,600
什么

3682
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:04,600
What?

3683
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:06,680
他们冲我来的 对不对

3684
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:06,680
They're coming here because of me, right?

3685
02:01:06,830 --> 02:01:09,540
冲彼得帕克来的对不对

3686
02:01:06,830 --> 02:01:09,540
Because I'm Peter Parker? So cast a new spell.

3687
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:12,000
那这次你就施一个让所有人都忘记彼得帕克是谁的咒

3688
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:12,000
But this time, make everyone forget who Peter Parker is.

3689
02:01:12,030 --> 02:01:13,390
让所有人都忘…

3690
02:01:12,030 --> 02:01:13,390
Make everyone forget...

3691
02:01:15,490 --> 02:01:16,320
忘了我

3692
02:01:15,490 --> 02:01:16,320
Me.

3693
02:01:16,340 --> 02:01:17,100
别

3694
02:01:16,340 --> 02:01:17,100
No.

3695
02:01:17,130 --> 02:01:18,430
行得通的 对吗

3696
02:01:17,130 --> 02:01:18,430
But it would work, right?

3697
02:01:18,450 --> 02:01:19,820
是 确实行得通

3698
02:01:18,450 --> 02:01:19,820
Yeah, it would work.

3699
02:01:21,330 --> 02:01:25,460
但你得明白 所有人 包括认识你的人和爱你的人

3700
02:01:21,330 --> 02:01:25,460
But you got to understand, that would mean everyone, who knows and loves you

3701
02:01:25,890 --> 02:01:26,900
我们都…

3702
02:01:25,890 --> 02:01:26,900
We'd...

3703
02:01:28,590 --> 02:01:30,400
我们关于你的所有记忆都会消失

3704
02:01:28,590 --> 02:01:30,400
We'd have no memory of you.

3705
02:01:32,270 --> 02:01:34,400
仿佛你这个人从来没存在过一样

3706
02:01:32,270 --> 02:01:34,400
It'll be as though you never existed.

3707
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:38,570
我明白

3708
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:38,570
I know.

3709
02:01:40,710 --> 02:01:41,900
施咒吧

3710
02:01:40,710 --> 02:01:41,900
Do it.

3711
02:01:46,010 --> 02:01:48,360
那你趁现在去跟他们道别吧 没多少时间了

3712
02:01:46,010 --> 02:01:48,360
Then go and say your goodbyes. You don't have long.

3713
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:49,720
谢谢你 先生

3714
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:49,720
Thank you, sir.

3715
02:01:49,750 --> 02:01:51,210
叫我斯蒂芬

3716
02:01:49,750 --> 02:01:51,210
Call me Stephen.

3717
02:01:54,280 --> 02:01:55,800
谢谢你 斯蒂芬

3718
02:01:54,280 --> 02:01:55,800
Thank you, Stephen.

3719
02:01:57,280 --> 02:01:58,280
Yeah...

3720
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:00,070
感觉还是怪怪的

3721
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:00,070
Still feels weird.

3722
02:02:02,850 --> 02:02:04,140
我们有缘再见了

3723
02:02:02,850 --> 02:02:04,140
I'll see you around.

3724
02:02:05,680 --> 02:02:07,170
再见 孩子

3725
02:02:05,680 --> 02:02:07,170
So long, kid.

3726
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:19,110
差不多了 你们是时候回家了

3727
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:19,110
I think this is it. I think you're about to go home.

3728
02:02:21,020 --> 02:02:22,770
但我…

3729
02:02:21,020 --> 02:02:22,770
But I... uhh...

3730
02:02:24,470 --> 02:02:25,540
谢谢你

3731
02:02:24,470 --> 02:02:25,540
Thank you.

3732
02:02:26,490 --> 02:02:27,770
我只是想…

3733
02:02:26,490 --> 02:02:27,770
I just wanted...

3734
02:02:27,830 --> 02:02:29,850
我想告诉你…

3735
02:02:27,830 --> 02:02:29,850
I wanna tell you that...

3736
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:32,160
但我不知道该怎么说…

3737
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:32,160
I really don't know how to say this, like...

3738
02:02:32,290 --> 02:02:33,000
彼得

3739
02:02:32,290 --> 02:02:33,000
Peter.

3740
02:02:33,030 --> 02:02:34,730
我想让你知道…

3741
02:02:33,030 --> 02:02:34,730
I want you to know that I...

3742
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:36,920
你懂的

3743
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:36,920
You know.

3744
02:02:37,270 --> 02:02:38,530
这是我们的宿命

3745
02:02:37,270 --> 02:02:38,530
It's what we do.

3746
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:41,790
对 我们的宿命

3747
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:41,790
Yeah. It's what we do.

3748
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:45,000
好了 我得去找MJ和奈德了

3749
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:45,000
Right. I gotta find Ned and MJ.

3750
02:02:46,980 --> 02:02:49,280
谢谢你 谢谢你们 真的谢谢你们

3751
02:02:46,980 --> 02:02:49,280
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!

3752
02:02:53,510 --> 02:02:54,720
那就这样了

3753
02:02:53,510 --> 02:02:54,720
I guess I'll see you.

3754
02:02:55,150 --> 02:02:56,590
- 注意安全 - 再见

3755
02:02:55,150 --> 02:02:56,590
- Keep safe. - Bye.

3756
02:03:00,050 --> 02:03:01,380
你真的很痛苦 不是吗

3757
02:03:00,050 --> 02:03:01,380
You're in so much pain, huh?

3758
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:02,650
- 是

3759
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:02,650
- I am. - Yeah.

3760
02:03:11,730 --> 02:03:12,820
你们还好吗

3761
02:03:11,730 --> 02:03:12,820
Are you okay?

3762
02:03:12,850 --> 02:03:14,210
我们没事

3763
02:03:12,850 --> 02:03:14,210
Yeah, we're okay.

3764
02:03:14,400 --> 02:03:16,120
喔 我的天啊 你在流血

3765
02:03:14,400 --> 02:03:16,120
Oh, my God. You're bleeding.

3766
02:03:16,150 --> 02:03:17,330
- 不 我没事 - 你确定吗

3767
02:03:16,150 --> 02:03:17,330
- No. I'm okay. - Are you sure?

3768
02:03:17,380 --> 02:03:18,980
我保证 我真的没事

3769
02:03:17,380 --> 02:03:18,980
I'm fine. I promise.

3770
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:25,140
我们得走了 是吗

3771
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:25,140
We should go, right?

3772
02:03:28,230 --> 02:03:30,170
你们将会彻底忘了我

3773
02:03:28,230 --> 02:03:30,170
You're gonna forget who I am.

3774
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:34,430
- 什么 - 彼得 你在说什么

3775
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:34,430
- What? - Peter, what are you talking about?

3776
02:03:35,730 --> 02:03:36,800
没事的

3777
02:03:35,730 --> 02:03:36,800
It's okay...

3778
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:39,180
之后我会来找你们的

3779
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:39,180
I'm gonna come and find you,

3780
02:03:39,210 --> 02:03:41,070
然后跟你们解释清楚所有事

3781
02:03:39,210 --> 02:03:41,070
and I'll explain everything.

3782
02:03:42,690 --> 02:03:44,420
我会让你们想起来的

3783
02:03:42,690 --> 02:03:44,420
I'll make you remember me.

3784
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:47,220
就仿佛这些事从来没有发生过

3785
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:47,220
It'll be like none of this ever happened.

3786
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:48,160
好吗

3787
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:48,160
Okay?

3788
02:03:48,190 --> 02:03:50,190
万一我想不起来怎么办

3789
02:03:48,190 --> 02:03:50,190
But what if that doesn't work?

3790
02:03:50,230 --> 02:03:52,710
万一不管用 万一我真的记不起你了怎么办

3791
02:03:50,230 --> 02:03:52,710
What if that doesn't work, what if we can't remember you?

3792
02:03:52,790 --> 02:03:54,130
我不想那样

3793
02:03:52,790 --> 02:03:54,130
I don't wanna do that.

3794
02:03:54,410 --> 02:03:55,880
我真的不想

3795
02:03:54,410 --> 02:03:55,880
I don't wanna do that.

3796
02:03:55,910 --> 02:03:57,430
我知道的 MJ 我知道的

3797
02:03:55,910 --> 02:03:57,430
I know. MJ, I know.

3798
02:03:57,990 --> 02:03:59,410
一定有其他办法的

3799
02:03:57,990 --> 02:03:59,410
There's gotta be something we can do.

3800
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:03,190
我们想其他办法好不好 肯定有其他选择的

3801
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:03,190
We can come up with like a plan or something? There's gotta be something we can do.

3802
02:04:04,700 --> 02:04:06,430
这是唯一的办法了

3803
02:04:04,700 --> 02:04:06,430
There's nothing we can do.

3804
02:04:10,590 --> 02:04:12,120
没事的

3805
02:04:10,590 --> 02:04:12,120
But we'll be okay.

3806
02:04:16,240 --> 02:04:17,390
你保证

3807
02:04:16,240 --> 02:04:17,390
Promise?

3808
02:04:20,170 --> 02:04:21,510
我保证

3809
02:04:20,170 --> 02:04:21,510
Yeah, I promise.

3810
02:04:33,220 --> 02:04:34,900
我会来找你的 好吗

3811
02:04:33,220 --> 02:04:34,900
I'll come find you. Okay?

3812
02:04:35,310 --> 02:04:36,650
我知道你一定会的

3813
02:04:35,310 --> 02:04:36,650
I know you will.

3814
02:04:41,260 --> 02:04:42,410
你最好不要食言

3815
02:04:41,260 --> 02:04:42,410
You better.

3816
02:04:49,810 --> 02:04:51,700
我保证有办法挽回的

3817
02:04:49,810 --> 02:04:51,700
I promise I'll fix this.

3818
02:04:52,920 --> 02:04:54,590
我真的好恨魔法

3819
02:04:52,920 --> 02:04:54,590
I really hate magic.

3820
02:04:55,840 --> 02:04:57,120
我也是

3821
02:04:55,840 --> 02:04:57,120
Yeah. Me, too.

3822
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:02,940
我爱你

3823
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:02,940
I love you.

3824
02:05:09,220 --> 02:05:09,880
我爱你…

3825
02:05:09,220 --> 02:05:09,880
I love you...

3826
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:14,110
你发誓 当我们再见面时你会跟我们解释一切

3827
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:14,110
Swear that, you will tell me if we meet again.

3828
02:07:24,970 --> 02:07:27,940
距离自由女神像惨案发生已经过去数周了

3829
02:07:24,970 --> 02:07:27,940
It's been a few weeks since the fiasco on the Statue of Liberty,

3830
02:07:27,960 --> 02:07:30,880
匿名义警蜘蛛侠的支持者们一直声称

3831
02:07:27,960 --> 02:07:30,880
and Spider-Man's cultists continue to contend

3832
02:07:30,910 --> 02:07:33,700
他是一个真正的英雄

3833
02:07:30,910 --> 02:07:33,700
that the vile vigilante is a hero.

3834
02:07:34,370 --> 02:07:38,740
但他要真是英雄的话 他为什么不摘下面具告诉我们他的真实身份呢

3835
02:07:34,370 --> 02:07:38,740
But if he were a hero, he'd unmask himself and tell us who he really is.

3836
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:41,930
因为他只是一个隐藏自己身份的懦夫

3837
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:41,930
Because only a coward conceals his identity.

3838
02:07:42,250 --> 02:07:45,470
只有懦夫才会隐藏他们真实的一面

3839
02:07:42,250 --> 02:07:45,470
Only a coward hides his true intentions.

3840
02:07:45,540 --> 02:07:49,330
稍事休息后 将为你揭开…

3841
02:07:45,540 --> 02:07:49,330
Rest assured, ladies and gentlemen, that this reporter will uncover those...

3842
02:07:51,940 --> 02:07:52,820
嗨

3843
02:07:51,940 --> 02:07:52,820
Hi.

3844
02:07:53,070 --> 02:07:56,160
我叫彼得帕克 你不认识我 但我…

3845
02:07:53,070 --> 02:07:56,160
My name is Peter Parker. You don't know me, but I...

3846
02:07:58,690 --> 02:08:01,590
我是彼得帕克 你还不认识我 但…

3847
02:07:58,690 --> 02:08:01,590
My name is Peter Parker and you don't know me, but...

3848
02:08:04,870 --> 02:08:05,870
好吧…

3849
02:08:04,870 --> 02:08:05,870
Okay...

3850
02:08:19,540 --> 02:08:20,540
嗨

3851
02:08:19,540 --> 02:08:20,540
Hi.

3852
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:28,660
有什么需要吗

3853
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:28,660
Can I help you?

3854
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:30,050
你好…

3855
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:30,050
Hi. Umm...

3856
02:08:30,250 --> 02:08:31,820
我叫彼得帕克

3857
02:08:30,250 --> 02:08:31,820
My name is Peter Parker.

3858
02:08:32,170 --> 02:08:33,350
我…

3859
02:08:32,170 --> 02:08:33,350
And I...

3860
02:08:36,380 --> 02:08:39,180
我想要杯咖啡 谢谢

3861
02:08:36,380 --> 02:08:39,180
would like a coffee. Please.

3862
02:08:40,150 --> 02:08:42,720
好啊 没问题 彼得帕克

3863
02:08:40,150 --> 02:08:42,720
Okay, no problem, Peter Parker.

3864
02:08:49,110 --> 02:08:51,760
给我的工程师伙计来个甜甜圈

3865
02:08:49,110 --> 02:08:51,760
Donuts for my fellow engineer.

3866
02:08:51,980 --> 02:08:54,780
- 等等 什么 - 麻省理工的工程师

3867
02:08:51,980 --> 02:08:54,780
- Wait, what? - MIT, they have the engineers.

3868
02:08:55,480 --> 02:08:57,840
噢 对对对 我应该知道的

3869
02:08:55,480 --> 02:08:57,840
Oh, right, right, right. I should probably know that.

3870
02:08:57,960 --> 02:08:59,810
看你长的就像麻省理工的

3871
02:08:57,960 --> 02:08:59,810
Look at you with the school spirit.

3872
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:14,580
彼得帕克

3873
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:14,580
Peter Parker?

3874
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,000
彼得帕克

3875
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Peter Parker?

3876
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:17,750
你的咖啡

3877
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:17,750
Your coffee.

3878
02:09:17,780 --> 02:09:19,320
噢 谢谢

3879
02:09:17,780 --> 02:09:19,320
Right. Thank you.

3880
02:09:21,900 --> 02:09:23,660
要去麻省理工了 你激动吗

3881
02:09:21,900 --> 02:09:23,660
Are you excited for MIT?

3882
02:09:26,250 --> 02:09:27,410
当然

3883
02:09:26,250 --> 02:09:27,410
Right. Yeah.

3884
02:09:28,710 --> 02:09:30,770
有点奇怪 但事实上我也挺激动的

3885
02:09:28,710 --> 02:09:30,770
Yeah, actually I am excited, which is weird

3886
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:32,410
因为基本上也没什么事能让我激动了

3887
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:32,410
because I don't really get excited about things.

3888
02:09:32,450 --> 02:09:34,580
我甚至有点期待失望

3889
02:09:32,450 --> 02:09:34,580
I kind of expect disappointment.

3890
02:09:35,080 --> 02:09:37,240
因为这样你就永远都不会失望了

3891
02:09:35,080 --> 02:09:37,240
'Cause then you'd never actually be disappointed.

3892
02:09:37,830 --> 02:09:38,830
对吗

3893
02:09:37,830 --> 02:09:38,830
Right?

3894
02:09:41,970 --> 02:09:43,420
没错

3895
02:09:41,970 --> 02:09:43,420
Yeah. Right.

3896
02:09:44,980 --> 02:09:46,210
我只是… 我不知道

3897
02:09:44,980 --> 02:09:46,210
It's just... I don't know...

3898
02:09:46,230 --> 02:09:48,630
出于某些原因 这次感觉有点不太一样

3899
02:09:46,230 --> 02:09:48,630
It just kinda feels different this time for some reason.

3900
02:10:02,640 --> 02:10:03,640
就很…

3901
02:10:02,640 --> 02:10:03,640
That was...

3902
02:10:13,370 --> 02:10:14,370
你没事吧

3903
02:10:13,370 --> 02:10:14,370
You okay?

3904
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:17,530
已经不疼了

3905
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:17,530
Doesn't really hurt anymore.

3906
02:10:28,420 --> 02:10:30,100
还有其他事吗

3907
02:10:28,420 --> 02:10:30,100
Is there anything else?

3908
02:10:43,030 --> 02:10:44,040
没了

3909
02:10:43,030 --> 02:10:44,040
No.

3910
02:10:47,720 --> 02:10:48,980
谢谢你

3911
02:10:47,720 --> 02:10:48,980
Thank you.

3912
02:10:49,590 --> 02:10:50,820
没问题

3913
02:10:49,590 --> 02:10:50,820
No problem.

3914
02:10:57,310 --> 02:10:58,510
下次见

3915
02:10:57,310 --> 02:10:58,510
See you around.

3916
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:05,180
你是怎么认识她的

3917
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:05,180
How do you know her?

3918
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:10,210
因为蜘蛛侠

3919
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:10,210
Through Spider-Man.

3920
02:12:11,140 --> 02:12:13,070
- 你呢 - 我也是

3921
02:12:11,140 --> 02:12:13,070
- You? - Same.

3922
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:20,690
前段时间我失去了一个很好的朋友

3923
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:20,690
I lost a good friend a while back.

3924
02:12:21,150 --> 02:12:22,600
就是这个感觉

3925
02:12:21,150 --> 02:12:22,600
It felt like this.

3926
02:12:25,330 --> 02:12:26,380
失去他们让我很伤心

3927
02:12:25,330 --> 02:12:26,380
Hurts cause they're gone,

3928
02:12:26,430 --> 02:12:29,120
之后想起他们代表了什么意味着什么以后 就更让人伤心了

3929
02:12:26,430 --> 02:12:29,120
and then it hurts all over again because you remember what they stood for,

3930
02:12:29,150 --> 02:12:30,740
然后你就会想…

3931
02:12:29,150 --> 02:12:30,740
and you wonder...

3932
02:12:31,370 --> 02:12:33,130
失去的就永远失去了吗

3933
02:12:31,370 --> 02:12:33,130
Is all that gone too?

3934
02:12:37,460 --> 02:12:38,980
不 还没有

3935
02:12:37,460 --> 02:12:38,980
No, it's not gone.

3936
02:12:41,740 --> 02:12:43,490
所有接受过她帮助的人…

3937
02:12:41,740 --> 02:12:43,490
Everybody she helped...

3938
02:12:45,710 --> 02:12:47,170
都会继续前行

3939
02:12:45,710 --> 02:12:47,170
they'll keep it going.

3940
02:12:48,280 --> 02:12:49,680
你真这样想的吗

3941
02:12:48,280 --> 02:12:49,680
You really think so?

3942
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:52,020
我就知道

3943
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:52,020
I know it.

3944
02:12:53,940 --> 02:12:55,530
照顾好你自己 好吗

3945
02:12:53,940 --> 02:12:55,530
Take care of yourself, okay?

3946
02:12:55,550 --> 02:12:57,400
我会的 很高兴认识你

3947
02:12:55,550 --> 02:12:57,400
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

3948
02:17:17,950 --> 02:17:18,970
Okay...

3949
02:17:20,710 --> 02:17:24,970
我想我明白了 你是说这个世界…

3950
02:17:20,710 --> 02:17:24,970
Okay, I think I got this. You're saying that this whole place here...

3951
02:17:25,070 --> 02:17:27,120
到处都是…

3952
02:17:25,070 --> 02:17:27,120
It's just tons of...

3953
02:17:27,980 --> 02:17:29,810
超能力者

3954
02:17:27,980 --> 02:17:29,810
Superpeople.

3955
02:17:29,860 --> 02:17:33,320
他已经重复这句话快一小时了

3956
02:17:29,860 --> 02:17:33,320
And he has been saying it for hours.

3957
02:17:33,510 --> 02:17:37,110
好吧 再给我捋一遍 抱歉我实在是太笨了

3958
02:17:33,510 --> 02:17:37,110
All right, tell me again. I'm sorry. I'm an idiot.

3959
02:17:37,240 --> 02:17:41,650
首先有个穿着锡制战袍 飞来飞去的亿万富翁

3960
02:17:37,240 --> 02:17:41,650
There was a billionaire. He had a tin suit, and he could fly. Right?

3961
02:17:43,270 --> 02:17:46,270
然后是一个异常暴躁浑身绿色的家伙

3962
02:17:43,270 --> 02:17:46,270
Okay. And there was a really angry green man.

3963
02:17:46,450 --> 02:17:48,010
- 浩克 - 浩克

3964
02:17:46,450 --> 02:17:48,010
- Hulk. - Hulk.

3965
02:17:48,120 --> 02:17:50,370
然后你觉得致命守护者这个名字很蠢

3966
02:17:48,120 --> 02:17:50,370
And you thought Lethal Protector was a shit name.

3967
02:17:50,480 --> 02:17:52,610
确实很蠢

3968
02:17:50,480 --> 02:17:52,610
Yeah, because it is.

3969
02:17:52,890 --> 02:17:56,810
那再跟我讲一遍关于那个有石头收集癖的紫皮外星人

3970
02:17:52,890 --> 02:17:56,810
Now, tell me again about your purple alien that loves stones.

3971
02:17:56,990 --> 02:17:59,730
因为据我了解 外星人 他们一点也不喜欢石头

3972
02:17:56,990 --> 02:17:59,730
'Cause I'll tell you what, man. Aliens, they do not love stones.

3973
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:01,000
埃迪 差不多得了

3974
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:01,000
Eddie, don't start!

3975
02:18:01,030 --> 02:18:03,930
你猜外星人真正喜欢什么 喜欢吃脑子

3976
02:18:01,030 --> 02:18:03,930
You know what aliens love? Eating brains!

3977
02:18:04,050 --> 02:18:06,130
因为这是外星人的本性 懂吗

3978
02:18:04,050 --> 02:18:06,130
Because that's what they do. All right?

3979
02:18:06,310 --> 02:18:08,850
先生 那个外星人把我全家都弄失踪了

3980
02:18:06,310 --> 02:18:08,850
Senor, he made my family disappear.

3981
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:11,130
失踪了整整五年

3982
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:11,130
For five years.

3983
02:18:12,470 --> 02:18:13,670
五年

3984
02:18:12,470 --> 02:18:13,670
Five years?

3985
02:18:15,780 --> 02:18:17,240
真够久的

3986
02:18:15,780 --> 02:18:17,240
That's a long time.

3987
02:18:19,720 --> 02:18:23,980
我觉得 我是不是该去纽约找这个...

3988
02:18:19,720 --> 02:18:23,980
I mean, maybe I should go to New York and speak to this,

3989
02:18:25,450 --> 02:18:26,550
叫蜘蛛侠的人谈谈

3990
02:18:25,450 --> 02:18:26,550
Spider-Man.

3991
02:18:26,780 --> 02:18:29,420
埃迪 我们已经醉了

3992
02:18:26,780 --> 02:18:29,420
Eddie! We are drunk!

3993
02:18:31,460 --> 02:18:34,140
- 我们去裸泳吧 - 我才不要去裸泳

3994
02:18:31,460 --> 02:18:34,140
- Let's go skinny-dip! - I don't think we should skinny-dip.

3995
02:18:34,250 --> 02:18:35,610
该买单了 先生

3996
02:18:34,250 --> 02:18:35,610
Sir, you have to pay your bill.

3997
02:18:36,070 --> 02:18:39,070
发生什么事了 不

3998
02:18:36,070 --> 02:18:39,070
What is happening? No!

3999
02:18:43,690 --> 02:18:45,480
他就这么跑了

4000
02:18:43,690 --> 02:18:45,480
And there he goes.

4001
02:18:46,160 --> 02:18:49,300
单没买 小费也不给

4002
02:18:46,160 --> 02:18:49,300
Without paying the bill, no tips, nothing.
