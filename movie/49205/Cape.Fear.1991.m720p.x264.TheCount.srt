I always thought that
for such a lovely river,

the name was mystifying,
Cape Fear.

When the only thing
to fear on those
enchanted summer nights

5
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:47,444
was that the magic
would end

come crashing in.

been following me?

159
00:11:00,187 --> 00:11:01,426
It's a small town.
Everywhere you turn,

160
00:11:01,547 --> 00:11:03,025
I guess, we're gonna
run into each other.
(STARTS ENGINE)

161
00:11:03,107 --> 00:11:04,346
Well, take care,
Mr. Cady.

162
00:11:04,428 --> 00:11:05,547
You, too.

163
00:11:09,147 --> 00:11:10,466
You're gonna learn
about loss.

164
00:11:10,547 --> 00:11:11,906
What?

165
00:11:21,628 --> 00:11:23,386
Dad, could you...

166
00:11:23,588 --> 00:11:24,867
Hmm?

167
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:26,668
Oh, I'm sorry, Dani.

168
00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:29,507
What're you working on?
It's English.

169
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:32,107
We're supposed to read
Look Homeward, Angel,

170
00:11:32,188 --> 00:11:34,027
which is a kind
of reminiscence,

171
00:11:34,108 --> 00:11:36,747
and we have to
attempt something
in the same style.

172
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:40,707
What's it about,
your reminiscence?

173
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,307
The houseboat.

174
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:46,747
Oh, the houseboat.

175
00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:53,468
LEIGH: It's not even
July 3rd yet.

176
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,509
Yeah.

177
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:55,828
Yeah. I was thinking
we ought to take

178
00:11:55,909 --> 00:11:57,108
two weeks off and
go up to Wilmington

179
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,628
like the old times,
dock the houseboat.

180
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,308
I wanted to
in early June.

181
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,948
Remember you said
you didn't have time
this summer.

182
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,028
I probably don't.

183
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,469
Yeah, well,
now I don't, either.

184
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,909
Besides,
Dani's got summer school
till Labor Day.

185
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,349
Is it really
that critical

186
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,708
that she can't
miss two damn weeks?

187
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,228
(SIGHS) Well, you know,
the alternative was
to expel her.

188
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,948
Besides,
maybe this Drama teacher
from the college

189
00:12:16,031 --> 00:12:17,829
will get her excited
about something,
you know?

190
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:19,870
Yeah, about him,
probably.

191
00:12:20,271 --> 00:12:21,949
I mean, why'd they have
to make such a stink,

192
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:24,110
like she was on heroin,
or something?

193
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,270
I mean, marijuana,
what's marijuana?

194
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,229
You and I smoked
a little dope
in our time.

195
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:29,349
Yeah.

196
00:12:29,431 --> 00:12:30,629
You know,
in some cultures,

197
00:12:30,711 --> 00:12:32,269
it's considered
almost a sacrament.

198
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,270
Of course,
I realize in ours,
it's forbidden.

199
00:12:34,351 --> 00:12:39,310
Right up there with incest
and necrophilia
and bestiality.

200
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:40,750
Honey. Honey. Honey.

201
00:12:40,832 --> 00:12:42,790
Worship of idols,
cannibalism.

202
00:12:42,872 --> 00:12:43,910
Do that again.

203
00:12:44,512 --> 00:12:45,631
What?

204
00:12:45,711 --> 00:12:47,070
Do that again.

205
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,631
(LAUGHS)

206
00:12:51,512 --> 00:12:53,191
(FIRECRACKERS EXPLODING)

207
00:14:34,076 --> 00:14:36,715
Sam. Sam,
somebody's out there!
What?

208
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,876
No, leave the light off.
Leave it off.

209
00:14:43,197 --> 00:14:45,075
I saw him when
the fireworks went off.

210
00:14:45,157 --> 00:14:46,196
(MURMURING)

211
00:14:46,277 --> 00:14:47,355
What?

212
00:14:47,797 --> 00:14:49,515
I think I talked
to him this afternoon.
You know him?

213
00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:53,635
I want you the hell
off my property!

214
00:15:06,117 --> 00:15:07,396
He's gone.

215
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,316
He said, "I'm gonna
make you think
about loss."

216
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:19,678
Or, "I'm gonna make
you learn about loss."
Something like that.

217
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:21,597
That's very poetic.

218
00:15:22,478 --> 00:15:23,797
So, who is he?
Where did he come from?

219
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:24,998
Well, he's from...

220
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,277
Come on, Leigh,
get the dog off.
Ben, get down.

221
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:29,597
(LAUGHS)

222
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,397
He doesn't
mind me at all.

223
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:32,917
Leigh, he's your dog.
Come on.

224
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,357
No, he shouldn't
be up on the table.

225
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,758
You're gonna have
dog hairs in the tea
and everything.

226
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,518
Get down.
So where's he from?

227
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:42,278
Oh, he's from the hills,
Pentecostal crackers,
you know.

228
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,319
What was he
in prison for?

229
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,599
I think it was battery.

230
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,078
You think
it was battery?
Yeah.

231
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,478
I mean, well,
who did he batter?

232
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,718
Did he batter a man?
Did he batter a woman?
What?

233
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,838
I don't know.

234
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,958
It was 14 years ago.
You know, it's kind of...

235
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,519
I really don't remember.

236
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,559
What does he want
with you?

237
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,999
He's just trying
to bug us,
just messing around.

238
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,319
You know,
he's an ex-con,
so he's just...

239
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,639
You know,
he's probably upset
at the lawyer.

240
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:15,640
Yeah, your clientele.

241
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:16,799
Yeah.

242
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,559
Bye, Dad.
Bye, Dani.

243
00:16:21,641 --> 00:16:22,639
You look tired.

244
00:16:22,721 --> 00:16:24,760
Thanks.
I needed that. Leigh.

245
00:16:25,481 --> 00:16:26,559
Leigh,
I don't want
to alarm her,

246
00:16:26,641 --> 00:16:28,600
but I'd rather Dani
didn't wander out alone

247
00:16:28,681 --> 00:16:30,480
on her soul-searching
walks in the woods

248
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:31,961
at least till I've
started a few things,

249
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,400
maybe even talked
to the boss.

250
00:16:33,481 --> 00:16:35,000
What if she takes
Benjamin with her?

251
00:16:35,082 --> 00:16:36,560
What? Big Ben,
our guard dog?

252
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:38,440
What's he gonna do,
lick him to death?

253
00:16:38,522 --> 00:16:40,000
Just tell her.
LEIGH: Tell her what?

254
00:16:40,081 --> 00:16:41,760
I hardly know anything
about the man.

255
00:16:41,841 --> 00:16:43,280
I don't mean
his biography.

256
00:16:43,362 --> 00:16:44,641
Just there's
some creep around.

257
00:16:44,722 --> 00:16:47,121
And if you see him again,
call the cops
and then call me.

258
00:16:47,202 --> 00:16:49,361
What about a weapon,
you know?

259
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:52,280
In case things get
exciting around here.

260
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:54,282
Look, Leigh,
would you really
feel more secure

261
00:16:54,362 --> 00:16:55,681
with a loaded gun
in the house?

262
00:16:55,762 --> 00:16:58,001
We'd probably end up
using it on each other.

263
00:16:58,082 --> 00:16:59,481
Or Dani would.

264
00:16:59,562 --> 00:17:01,681
He's not gonna do anything.
He just got out of prison.

265
00:17:01,762 --> 00:17:03,961
He doesn't want
to go right back.
All right?

266
00:17:06,523 --> 00:17:08,041
Call Lee Heller.

267
00:17:08,603 --> 00:17:10,042
Lee is
a colorful character,

268
00:17:10,123 --> 00:17:11,962
but he's still the best
criminal lawyer
in the state.

269
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:14,121
Good.
Bonnie,
get me Lee Heller.

270
00:17:14,763 --> 00:17:17,083
Sam, you defended
this guy, right?

271
00:17:17,163 --> 00:17:18,081
Right.

272
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:19,963
So, what makes you think
he wants to harm you?

273
00:17:20,044 --> 00:17:21,922
Yesterday I was
getting in my car.

274
00:17:22,004 --> 00:17:24,642
The guy comes up,
we have a little
conversation.

275
00:17:24,724 --> 00:17:27,842
He says to me,
"You're gonna
learn about loss."

276
00:17:29,084 --> 00:17:31,883
That'd hardly qualify
under the terrorist
threat statutes.

277
00:17:32,204 --> 00:17:34,883
Oh, come on, Tom,
for Christ's sake,
the guy's an ex-con.

278
00:17:34,964 --> 00:17:37,843
You know
as well as I do
what that means.

279
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:40,524
I mean, last night,
there he was,
he was behind our house.

280
00:17:40,765 --> 00:17:42,203
Ah. Attempted B and E.

281
00:17:42,285 --> 00:17:43,483
No, not exactly.

282
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:47,043
I mean,
he was sitting on a wall
that bounds our property.

283
00:17:47,124 --> 00:17:49,724
(LAUGHS) That's not
even trespassing, Sam.

284
00:17:49,805 --> 00:17:51,364
I mean, come on.
What can I say?

285
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,964
I mean,
get a restraining order.

286
00:17:53,045 --> 00:17:56,244
I did.
I filed one this morning.
The hearing's in 10 days.

287
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,564
Good. Good.
I mean, you know,
anything I can do.

288
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,644
Tom, 14 years ago

289
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:06,284
in this case
I had a report
on the victim.

290
00:18:06,605 --> 00:18:08,364
It was a rape case.
That's right.

291
00:18:08,446 --> 00:18:10,685
Rape and
aggravated sexual battery.

292
00:18:10,766 --> 00:18:12,445
Anyway,
I had a report
on this victim

293
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:15,405
and it came back that
she was promiscuous.

294
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:18,404
And...

295
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:20,925
I buried it.

296
00:18:22,286 --> 00:18:23,484
Whew.

297
00:18:25,446 --> 00:18:26,445
Anybody else know
about this?

298
00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:27,644
No, no, no,
I buried it.

299
00:18:27,726 --> 00:18:28,805
I mean,
I didn't show it
to the client,

300
00:18:28,886 --> 00:18:31,005
I didn't show it
to the prosecution.

301
00:18:31,087 --> 00:18:33,846
But if you had seen
what this guy had
done to this girl...

302
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:36,966
"In every
criminal prosecution,
the accused shall have

303
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:38,845
"the Assistance of
Counsel for his defense."

304
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:40,046
I know
the Sixth Amendment.

305
00:18:40,127 --> 00:18:41,406
I believe in
the Sixth Amendment.

306
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,925
I mean, that's why I left
the Public Defender's Office.

307
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:46,685
There was no way
to serve the law
in that capacity.

308
00:18:46,768 --> 00:18:47,727
Some folks just
don't have the right

309
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:48,845
to the best defense,
huh, Sam?

310
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,006
No! Of course
they deserve
the best defense!

311
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:53,686
But, I mean,
if you had seen what

00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:10,646
But I don't see how
he could know that.

319
00:19:10,728 --> 00:19:11,847
I mean,
he was illiterate.

320
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:14,007
I mean, I had to
read everything to him,

321

There's no way
he could know that.

Hey, Dani,
it's so quiet out here,

why don't you get your book
and come out here and read?

Why?

327
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,089
I told you why.

328
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:47,248
Well, is it because
he's like a flasher
or just a peeper?

329
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,009
What do you know
about that?

I've been flashed
before?

Oh, well,
I certainly didn't mean
to insult you.

been flashed before.

I was.

I was your lawyer.
I defended you.

instead of battery.

Oh, I'd have been up
for parole either way
in seven years

according to the
Georgia penal code.

a capital offense.

you could've done death.

I acted as

do you want, Mr. Cady?

How much
do I want what?

do you want?

do I look destitute
to you?

Well,
I'm open to discussion,
within reasonable limits.

A woman.

ugly hillbilly's
wet dream?

381
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:22,495
Look, I realize that
you suffered in prison.

382
00:22:22,577 --> 00:22:23,536
Suffered.

383
00:22:23,656 --> 00:22:24,895
There's no question
about that.
"Suffered."

384
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:27,735
You don't know
what suffering is,
Counselor.

385
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:30,535
Like it says
in Galatians 3,

386
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:33,336
"Have ye suffered
so many things in vain?"

387
00:22:34,617 --> 00:22:35,616
Yeah.

388
00:22:35,697 --> 00:22:37,576
I learned from
the get-go in the joint
to get in touch

389
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:41,175
with the soft
nurturing side of myself,
the feminine side.

390
00:22:45,977 --> 00:22:50,496
Well, I'm open to
some sort of discussion
on compensation.

391
00:22:51,658 --> 00:22:54,017
What shall be
my compensation, sir,

392
00:22:54,098 --> 00:22:57,177
for being held down
and sodomized
by four white guys

393
00:22:57,258 --> 00:22:59,136
or four black guys?

394
00:23:00,499 --> 00:23:02,497
Shall my compensation
be the same?

395
00:23:02,578 --> 00:23:05,497
What is the formula
for compensation, sir?

396
00:23:05,858 --> 00:23:08,057
How about $10,000
in cash?

397
00:23:10,938 --> 00:23:12,097
Do I...

398
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,578
Well, let's just
break that down.
No.

399
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:19,658
Now, wait, wait,
wait a minute.
Let's just break it down.

400
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:21,058
You see,
that figure just came
to the top of my head.

401
00:23:21,139 --> 00:23:22,658
Well, let's just say,
for argument's sake,

402
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:25,739
let's say $20,000,
let's say $30,000.

403
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:27,858
Say...
I'll tell you what.
Let's say $50,000.

404
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,179
$50,000 into 14 years.

405
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:34,858
Fourteen years times
365 days is about...

406
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,059
I say about 5,000 days.

407
00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:41,338
Now,
you divide that by $50,000,
and that's like $10 a day.

I called the vet.

431

because

432

he was winding down,

just winding down
like an old clock.

434
00:24:54,623 --> 00:24:57,422
And then,
all of a sudden,
he just stopped.

435
00:24:59,143 --> 00:25:00,902
He had this kind of...

and this kind of

And then he died.

440

even got here.

00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,185
One-way mirror,
Mr. Bowden.

467
00:26:17,267 --> 00:26:18,745
He doesn't
know you're here.

468
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:20,545
Yeah. Yeah, that's him.

469
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,386
Get the shirt off.

470
00:26:23,627 --> 00:26:25,026
Come on, hurry up.

471
00:26:25,107 --> 00:26:27,026
Let's go.
Just pass it
over to him.

472
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:30,665
Hand it to me.

473
00:26:30,748 --> 00:26:32,186
All right.
Knock off the shoes.

474
00:26:33,387 --> 00:26:35,586
Hand them to
the other officer.

475
00:26:37,188 --> 00:26:39,426
Pass them to him.
Come on, come on.

476
00:26:41,628 --> 00:26:43,786
All right.
Let's put the arms out.

477
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,667
Put your arms
out straight.

478
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:49,546
Roll your palms.
OFFICER 2:
Do what he says.

479
00:26:52,788 --> 00:26:54,386
OFFICER 1:
Turn around, slow.

480
00:27:00,989 --> 00:27:02,587
(SCOFFS)

481
00:27:03,109 --> 00:27:06,067
I don't know whether
to look at him
or read him.

482
00:27:09,389 --> 00:27:10,748
OFFICER 1:
Stand still.

483
00:27:13,189 --> 00:27:15,948
OFFICER 2:
One more step for you.
You know the routine.

484
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:19,428
Against the wall.

485
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:23,349
We searched his apartment.
His car registration
and everything's in order.

486
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:26,868
There's no guns or
any other weapons.
But we found these.

487
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,189
ELGART: Cady's
savings account.

488
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:32,988
$30,000?

489
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,829
Yeah, well, see,
his mother died
while he was serving

490
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,909
and the farm
got sold off.
He got the proceeds.

491
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,949
Well, he's got money.
Where does that leave us?

492
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,709
ELGART: Well,
at the very least,
we nail him for the dog.

493
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,789
Now, what happened?

494
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:45,549
You let the dog out.
Cady abducted him.

495
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:46,629
No.

496
00:27:47,911 --> 00:27:49,710
We didn't
let the dog out.

497
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:51,869
Cady came
into your house?

498
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,629
That's illegal entry
with intent.

499
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:56,789
Yeah. But he didn't
come in the house.

500
00:27:57,991 --> 00:28:01,510
Look, I'm not a cop.
I don't know exactly
how he did it.

501
00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:03,950
I just know that
he did it somehow.

502
00:28:04,311 --> 00:28:06,110
That's not good enough,
Mr. Bowden.

503
00:28:06,192 --> 00:28:08,231
Now, you're a lawyer.
You damn well know that.

504
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,910
OFFICER 1:
Get off the pants.

505
00:28:15,072 --> 00:28:16,510
Sooner or later,
he's gonna screw up.

506
00:28:16,592 --> 00:28:18,150
I mean, the sheriff
assured me

507
00:28:18,232 --> 00:28:20,151
that they always do.
He's an ex-con.

508
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:22,631
And then he's going
to get the message
in no uncertain terms.

509
00:28:22,712 --> 00:28:24,151
I'd still like
to kill him.

510
00:28:26,592 --> 00:28:28,391
(BAND PLAYING)

511
00:28:36,153 --> 00:28:37,672
(CROWD CHEERING)

512
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:49,591
Now, Dani, how come
you didn't join up
with them? You can tap.

513
00:28:49,674 --> 00:28:51,713
Yeah, you can do that.
You can tap dance.

514
00:28:51,793 --> 00:28:55,752
I wanted to once,
but I don't know...

515
00:29:05,594 --> 00:29:06,672
Son of a bitch.

516
00:29:06,754 --> 00:29:07,753
What?

517
00:29:12,674 --> 00:29:13,913
He's staring at you.

518
00:29:13,994 --> 00:29:15,193
What are you
talking about?

519
00:29:20,115 --> 00:29:21,793
What the hell
are you doing?

520
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:24,074
Hot as a firecracker
on the 4th of July.

521
00:29:26,075 --> 00:29:28,194
You're damn lucky
to have her, boy.

522
00:29:28,275 --> 00:29:29,634
You son of a bitch.

523
00:29:29,715 --> 00:29:31,273
Where did he go?

524
00:29:31,595 --> 00:29:32,913
Son of a...

525
00:29:37,636 --> 00:29:40,474
Watch my arm.
Watch my arm.
It might be broke.

526
00:29:40,836 --> 00:29:41,914
What's with you, buddy?

527
00:29:41,996 --> 00:29:43,675
You have no right
to be pushing me
around like that.

528
00:29:43,755 --> 00:29:44,754
I was just
watching the parade.

529
00:29:44,835 --> 00:29:45,874
I wasn't pranking
on nobody.

530
00:29:45,956 --> 00:29:47,275
You son of a bitch!

531
00:29:47,356 --> 00:29:49,595
What are you getting
so upset about?

532
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:51,355
You're lucky
I don't sue you.

533
00:29:53,356 --> 00:29:54,595
All right.
All right.

534
00:29:54,676 --> 00:29:55,635
MAN: Settle down.

535
00:29:55,716 --> 00:29:56,955
SAM: I am. I am.
I am settled down.

536
00:29:58,836 --> 00:30:00,075
Sam,
what are you doing?

537
00:30:00,157 --> 00:30:01,116
Oh, it's nothing.

538
00:30:01,196 --> 00:30:03,074
Who was that?
It's no one.

539
00:30:03,157 --> 00:30:04,516
Who was that?
No one. Come on.

540
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:07,595
The fellow with the tie,
his wife took him away.

541
00:30:08,716 --> 00:30:10,035
MAN: I think
he really hurt his arm.

542
00:30:10,117 --> 00:30:11,236
Mom!

543
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,916
LORI: That's an awfully
strong drink you've
got there, mister.

544
00:30:15,997 --> 00:30:17,475
CADY: You said it, boy.
(LAUGHS)

545
00:30:17,557 --> 00:30:20,996
You just put
a little goldfish in it,
and you'll be fine.

546
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:24,636
You seem to be
having a good time.

547
00:30:24,718 --> 00:30:26,077
I've been practicing.

548
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,475
Practicing for what?

549
00:30:28,238 --> 00:30:29,237
How to fall
on the floor?

550
00:30:29,318 --> 00:30:30,597
A life of debauchery.

551
00:30:30,678 --> 00:30:31,717
"Debauch," what?

552
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,637
Debauchery.
It's a three-syllable word.
Yeah.

553
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,276
(LAUGHING)

554
00:30:36,358 --> 00:30:38,717
Making fun of me?
That's okay. No problem.

555
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:39,917
No, I'm not. I'm not.

556
00:30:39,998 --> 00:30:40,957
I made you blush.

557
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:41,957
Blush?

558
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:45,557
Yes. You're now the color
of your shirt, scarlet.

559
00:30:45,998 --> 00:30:47,157
(CHUCKLES)

560
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:51,237
I had no business
getting stuck on a guy
who was married.

561
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:52,838
You certainly did not.

562
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:54,397
I don't know
what I was thinking.

563
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:56,398
God only knows.

564
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:58,878
Now aren't I the bozo
on this bus?

565
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,198
Oh, God. Lest you think
that I slept with
this particular

566
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,118
married guy...
That's your business.
Not mine.

567
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:06,518
I don't want to
make it sound like

568
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:07,878
I've been through
a busload of them.

569
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,799
That's the way
it sounded to me.

570
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,118
He was the first.

571
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:13,198
Oh, yeah.

572
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,678
He was, I swear.

573
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,838
Oh, yeah.

574
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,677
Oh, boy.
Tell it to the judge.

575
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,478
(BOTH LAUGHING)

576
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,879
Actually the rat
stood me up today.

577
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,919
Did he?

578
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,399
Yes!
What a shame.

579
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:26,639
I know.

580
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,679
So, now it's my turn.
Where are you from?

581
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,799
Where am I from?
Yes.

582
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,799
You're gonna love this.
Yes.

583
00:31:32,881 --> 00:31:37,000
I'm from
the Georgia State
Correctional Facility.

584
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,798
(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)

585
00:31:43,761 --> 00:31:45,320
Now you think I'm joking?
That's the truth.

586
00:31:45,401 --> 00:31:46,720
I just got released
from prison.

587
00:31:46,961 --> 00:31:50,440
Oh, my God.
This is the way my day
has been turning out.

588
00:31:51,802 --> 00:31:53,920
Actually,
it reminds me
of a joke.

589
00:31:54,641 --> 00:31:56,040
Do you want
to hear it?
Tell me.

590
00:31:56,121 --> 00:31:57,560
Liven up the night.
All right.

591
00:31:58,202 --> 00:32:00,640
An unmarried woman...

592
00:32:00,722 --> 00:32:02,280
Wait a minute,
that's not it.
An unmarried woman...

593
00:32:02,362 --> 00:32:03,881
Come on, get the joke
straight, darling.

594
00:32:03,962 --> 00:32:05,680
Shut up. Shut up.
Let me do it.

595
00:32:05,762 --> 00:32:07,561
An unmarried woman,
she meets a guy

596
00:32:07,642 --> 00:32:10,401
and he tells her
he just got out
of prison.

597
00:32:10,482 --> 00:32:12,161
"What did you do?"
She asks.

598
00:32:12,242 --> 00:32:14,880
"I hacked my wife
into 52 pieces
with a chain saw."

599
00:32:14,962 --> 00:32:16,240
(LAUGHS LOUDLY)

600
00:32:17,362 --> 00:32:19,961
She says,
"So, you're single?"

601
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:22,601
That's even funnier.
Thank you.

602
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:24,921
Could I ask you
something?
What?

603
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:26,561
What did you do?
I knew you were
going to ask that.

604
00:32:27,123 --> 00:32:29,082
I hacked my wife
into 52 pieces.

605
00:32:29,163 --> 00:32:31,082
I was afraid you were
gonna say that.

606
00:32:31,763 --> 00:32:34,322
Well, I'm a very
small person,
so maybe...

607
00:32:34,403 --> 00:32:36,802
Maybe I can hack you
into 40 pieces.

608
00:32:36,883 --> 00:32:38,282
(BOTH LAUGHING)

609
00:32:41,483 --> 00:32:42,562
What did you do,
really?

610
00:32:42,643 --> 00:32:44,562
"No, really,
but what did you do?"

611
00:32:46,563 --> 00:32:50,602
No, I just...
There was this protest march
on this nuclear power plant,

612
00:32:50,683 --> 00:32:53,122
and so when they came
to arrest us,

613
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:55,683
this macho sheriff
got a tad rough with
the lady behind me,

614
00:32:55,764 --> 00:32:57,683
so, I popped
the little bastard,

615
00:32:57,764 --> 00:32:59,442
so they gave me
a little time for it.

616
00:33:00,805 --> 00:33:03,643
I'm drinking a Sea Breeze.
I hope you can afford them.

617
00:33:03,724 --> 00:33:04,843
But you gotta
stay sober.

618
00:33:04,924 --> 00:33:07,843
If you ain't sober,
then you're taking
your chances.

619
00:33:07,925 --> 00:33:09,844
Because I'm just
one hell of an animal.

That's the love of my life.
She's no longer with us.

Only that there
are some things

handled quietly.

file a restraining order?

Just think of
this fellow Cady
as a tiger.

726
00:38:31,938 --> 00:38:34,017
The trick is to
get him out
of the brush.

00:38:34,098 --> 00:38:35,497
Now how do we
do that?

728
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:38,298

a couple of your goats
and hide in a tree.

What are you suggesting,
Lieutenant?

730
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:43,058
That I use
my family as bait?
And then what?

731
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:45,138
What? I'm gonna hope
that this psychopath

732
00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:46,898
attacks my wife
and child?

733
00:38:46,979 --> 00:38:48,498
And then what?
Blow his head off?

734
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:49,577
I'm a law officer.

735
00:38:50,299 --> 00:38:52,818
It would be
unethical of me
to advise a citizen

736
00:38:52,899 --> 00:38:54,818
to take the law
into his own hands.

737
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,219
So, I suppose you must've
misunderstood me.

738
00:38:57,299 --> 00:38:58,658
Oh, I guess I must've.

739
00:38:59,459 --> 00:39:01,818
Well, pardon me
all over the place.

740
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:29,859
And he's been
harassing my family,
but he's clever.

741
00:39:30,221 --> 00:39:32,700
I mean, cleverly,
so that the law
can't touch him.

742
00:39:32,781 --> 00:39:34,421
Also I believe
that he's able to slip

743
00:39:34,501 --> 00:39:36,099
into the house
and out undetected.

744
00:39:36,182 --> 00:39:37,780
Although, is he out?
I can't tell.

745
00:39:37,861 --> 00:39:40,540
He's either out
or he's in.
I'm not sure.

746
00:39:40,621 --> 00:39:42,060
Well, I can't
see through walls,
Mr. Bowden.

747
00:39:42,141 --> 00:39:45,580
I'm not asking you
to see through walls.
That's fine.

748
00:39:45,782 --> 00:39:47,581
I mean,
why can't anybody
do anything for me?

749
00:39:47,662 --> 00:39:49,540
What good are cops
and laws...

750
00:39:49,622 --> 00:39:51,300
Sam, Sam, Sam,
calm down.

751
00:39:51,382 --> 00:39:53,140
Let me explain
something to you.

752
00:39:53,222 --> 00:39:55,861
See, the system
is set up to handle
generalized problems

753
00:39:55,943 --> 00:39:57,901
like burglary
and robbery.

754
00:39:58,502 --> 00:40:01,661
But if some lone creep
out there targets you
for some obscure reason,

755
00:40:01,742 --> 00:40:04,941
the system is
slow and skeptical.
It's pathetic even.

756
00:40:06,343 --> 00:40:07,781
What's your connection
with this fellow?

(SIGHS)

758
00:40:09,142 --> 00:40:11,141
I was his lawyer,
his public defender.

759
00:40:11,223 --> 00:40:13,101
But you shafted
him somehow, right?
(LAUGHS)

760
00:40:14,023 --> 00:40:15,861
Well, at least that's
the way he perceives it.
Sam, Sam.

761
00:40:15,943 --> 00:40:18,501
I don't care
what you did.
What did he do?

762
00:40:18,943 --> 00:40:20,982
He raped
a 16-year-old girl.

763
00:40:22,063 --> 00:40:23,582
Do you have a daughter
around sixteen?

764
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:25,662
She's fifteen.

765
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:27,622
All right.
Here's the deal.

766
00:40:27,704 --> 00:40:29,103
I'll do a background check
on him,

767
00:40:29,183 --> 00:40:31,142
follow him for about a week
and write you up
a risk assessment.

768
00:40:31,223 --> 00:40:32,422
All right, good.
Great, great.

769
00:40:32,504 --> 00:40:33,463
Now, the cops...

770
00:40:33,543 --> 00:40:34,822
I can find him.

771
00:40:34,904 --> 00:40:36,462
His name's Max Cady.
You already told me.

772
00:40:36,664 --> 00:40:38,782
Just take it easy.
Stay calm.

773
00:40:39,544 --> 00:40:42,222
Now, Dani, you can
just relax because

774
00:40:42,305 --> 00:40:45,864
your daddy has
a private investigator
on the payroll.

775
00:40:46,425 --> 00:40:47,903
Isn't that right?

776
00:40:48,745 --> 00:40:51,624
What's your feeling
about him?
What, Sam Spade?

777
00:40:51,985 --> 00:40:54,344
Mickey Spillane?
Peter Gunn?

778
00:40:55,425 --> 00:40:57,143
Dirty Harry?
Perry Mason?

779
00:40:57,225 --> 00:40:58,744
No, no, no, no.
Perry Mason...

780
00:40:58,825 --> 00:41:00,104
Perry Mason
was a lawyer.

781
00:41:00,185 --> 00:41:01,943
No, the minute
I walked in
this guy's office,

782
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:03,223
I felt totally relaxed.

783
00:41:03,305 --> 00:41:05,224
I mean, this guy is
totally in charge.

784
00:41:05,305 --> 00:41:07,183
Kersek deals
with these types
for a living.

785
00:41:07,266 --> 00:41:09,305
He looked like
he was going
to enjoy...

(TELEPHONE RINGS)
(ALL GASP)

787
00:41:12,145 --> 00:41:13,784
Yes?
Yeah, it's me.

788
00:41:13,865 --> 00:41:16,144
After you left,
I had this interesting
conversation

789
00:41:16,225 --> 00:41:17,904
with a C.O. Over at
Statesboro prison.

790
00:41:18,106 --> 00:41:20,344
Mmm-hmm.
Seems our man Cady had
a job in the kitchen.

791
00:41:20,426 --> 00:41:21,385
Right.

792
00:41:21,466 --> 00:41:22,944
There was this other
inmate working in there
with him,

793
00:41:23,026 --> 00:41:24,665
he was an obstinate
S. O.B.
Right.

794
00:41:25,146 --> 00:41:26,425
He hated Cady's
cigar smoke

795
00:41:26,506 --> 00:41:28,865
and he was always bitching
and moaning about it.

796
00:41:28,946 --> 00:41:30,065
Well, one day,
they found him

797
00:41:30,147 --> 00:41:31,946
with his neck broke
and his tongue bit off.

798
00:41:32,026 --> 00:41:33,665
Oh, Jesus.
Yeah.

799
00:41:34,107 --> 00:41:35,786
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

800
00:41:38,026 --> 00:41:40,425
KERSEK: They never could
place Cady near the scene
of the accident,

801
00:41:40,507 --> 00:41:43,625
if you want
to call it that,
at least not out loud.

802
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:47,826
But the parole board,
they kept him in
for another seven years.

803
00:41:48,267 --> 00:41:50,586
Uh-oh.
The subject is on the move.
Get a good night's sleep.

804
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,346
DANIELLE: Who was that?
Our private eye.

805
00:41:53,707 --> 00:41:55,145
I thought
we were relaxed now.

WOMAN ON PHONE:
New Essex County Hospital.

807
00:41:59,027 --> 00:42:02,226
Yes, room 5036, please.

808
00:42:02,307 --> 00:42:03,306
One minute, please.

809
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:04,465
All right.

LORI ON PHONE: Hello?

811
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:07,467
Hi, Lori,
it's me, Sam.

812
00:42:07,548 --> 00:42:09,706
Lori, I just
feel God-awful

813
00:42:09,788 --> 00:42:11,066
you got dragged
into this thing.

814
00:42:11,148 --> 00:42:12,186
It's not your fault.

815
00:42:12,268 --> 00:42:14,867
If I had any idea
that Cady would hurt you

816
00:42:14,948 --> 00:42:16,987
to get at me,
I would have warned you.

817
00:42:17,069 --> 00:42:19,867
Yeah, I know. I know.
I'm glad you called.

818
00:42:19,949 --> 00:42:21,547
Yeah. Yeah, well.

819
00:42:21,628 --> 00:42:23,267
I'm so sorry
about this.

820
00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:24,947
I feel the same way.

821
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,827
So, are you
really determined

822
00:42:28,909 --> 00:42:30,428
about moving back
to Connecticut?

823
00:42:30,509 --> 00:42:32,347
Well, I've thought
about it a lot.

824
00:42:32,429 --> 00:42:34,947
I just think it's
probably the best thing.

825
00:42:35,629 --> 00:42:38,268
I thought that
maybe I could
go back to school.

826
00:42:39,029 --> 00:42:41,508
I'm really going
to miss you, though.

827
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,428
Right.
Excuse me, Lori.

828
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,308
You know,
that sounds real good.
Yeah.

829
00:42:45,389 --> 00:42:47,388
That's gonna work out fine.
I'll get right back to you.

830
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,228
Okay. Bye.
All right, bye.

831
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:56,188
Well, I just don't know
what I hate more,

832
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:01,388
that insipid tone
or your stupid,
sophomoric infidelities.

833
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,189
Who was that? Huh?

834
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:05,788
The girl that
got beat up?

835
00:43:05,871 --> 00:43:06,990
Yes,
it was the girl
that got beat up.

836
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,388
Lori Davis.
I already told you.

837
00:43:08,471 --> 00:43:10,629
She works at
the county courthouse.
She's a clerk.

838
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:13,349
And what?
You're fucking her?

839
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,589
Interesting choice, Sam.

840
00:43:16,671 --> 00:43:18,429
Calling from
our bedroom phone.

841
00:43:18,511 --> 00:43:20,349
You know, Leigh,
why is it that

842
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,630
whenever I have
a private phone
conversation,

843
00:43:22,711 --> 00:43:25,870
you assume that
I'm fucking someone,
huh? Why is that?

844
00:43:25,951 --> 00:43:28,230
That's why
that psychopath
chose her, right?

845
00:43:28,311 --> 00:43:30,310
Yes, yes, that's why
he chose her.

846
00:43:30,391 --> 00:43:32,389
But I'm not
fucking her
in any way.

847
00:43:34,632 --> 00:43:37,391
Well, you sleazy
son of a bitch!

848
00:43:37,471 --> 00:43:38,750
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!

849
00:43:38,831 --> 00:43:40,670
Goddamn you!
You son of a bitch!

850
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:41,990
Stop it! Leigh!

851
00:43:42,432 --> 00:43:44,351
Dani is
right downstairs.

852
00:43:45,432 --> 00:43:47,671
Oh. Oh, honey,
there's nothing
the matter.

853
00:43:47,752 --> 00:43:49,431
Yeah, I can see, Dad.

854
00:43:50,512 --> 00:43:53,311
LEIGH: I thought
you promised to leave all
that shit behind in Atlanta.

855

LEIGH: Christ,
what a waste!

858
00:44:02,793 --> 00:44:03,951
The humiliation
we went through

859
00:44:04,033 --> 00:44:05,791
confessing all our
dirty little secrets

860
00:44:05,873 --> 00:44:07,872
in those horrible sessions
with Dr. Hackett.

861
00:44:07,953 --> 00:44:10,111
Yeah. We talked that
one damn incident
to death, didn't we?

862
00:44:10,193 --> 00:44:11,271
Yeah.
Why did you bother?

863
00:44:11,353 --> 00:44:12,632
Because you
asked me to go.

864
00:44:12,713 --> 00:44:13,912
I mean,
why did you bother?

865
00:44:13,993 --> 00:44:15,471
Why did you bother?

866
00:44:15,554 --> 00:44:19,152
Why did you bother
with you and me?
With the marriage?

867
00:44:20,714 --> 00:44:22,953
Uprooting me and Dani?
Moving?

868
00:44:23,354 --> 00:44:24,753
Because that's
what we decided to do!

869
00:44:24,874 --> 00:44:26,872
You said that
you wanted to get out!
You don't get it, do you, Sam?

870
00:44:26,954 --> 00:44:28,032
All right, Leigh.
What is it I don't get?

871
00:44:28,114 --> 00:44:29,192
You just don't get it.

What don't I get?

through all of that!

I'm just
losing my mind here.

878
00:44:44,794 --> 00:44:47,033
You don't have
the balls to walk out,

879
00:44:47,115 --> 00:44:48,673
if that's
what you wanted.
Oh, what I wanted?

880
00:44:48,755 --> 00:44:51,193
Like I was going to split,
with you acting
the way you acted.

881

Acting?
Yeah.

882

doing any acting?

Well, hey,
let me refresh
your memory.

885
00:44:58,795 --> 00:45:00,874
Do you remember
not taking any work
for three months?

886
00:45:00,956 --> 00:45:02,794
Do you remember that?
You remember not
fixing any meals?

I'm not on
fucking trial here!

888

Do you remember crying
every goddamn morning,
afternoon, every evening?

889
00:45:08,036 --> 00:45:09,715
Do you remember that?

890
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:14,235
I scared you, huh?

891
00:45:15,476 --> 00:45:17,395
What did you think, Sam?

892
00:45:18,117 --> 00:45:21,155
What did you think?
You thought maybe I was
going to kill myself?

893
00:45:21,236 --> 00:45:22,834
Over you?
Who else?

894
00:45:22,917 --> 00:45:23,995
You pompous ass.

895
00:45:24,076 --> 00:45:25,755
Oh, God damn it, Leigh,
who knew what
you were gonna do?

896
00:45:25,877 --> 00:45:26,876
You wouldn't
leave the bedroom!

897
00:45:26,956 --> 00:45:28,635
Yeah. I wish you
could say the same.

898
00:45:28,716 --> 00:45:31,475
Now, look, isn't this
what Dr. Hackett
talked about?

899
00:45:31,557 --> 00:45:33,235
Digging up the past.

900
00:45:35,956 --> 00:45:37,235
I mean,
the relevant issue here

901
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:39,155
is whether I've been
messing around
in New Essex.

902
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:40,755
And I have not been.

903
00:45:40,837 --> 00:45:44,036
As far as this girl goes,
Lori, she's just a kid.

904
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:45,435
Well,
that shouldn't stop you.

905
00:45:45,837 --> 00:45:46,956
She's a baby.

906
00:45:47,038 --> 00:45:48,356
I mean, you know
when you gravitate
to people

907
00:45:48,437 --> 00:45:49,476
in the same world
as you...

908
00:45:49,557 --> 00:45:51,076
You gravitate to women.

909
00:45:51,158 --> 00:45:52,436
Oh, come on, Leigh,
for Christ sake,

910
00:45:52,518 --> 00:45:54,516
I'm a lawyer,
she's a clerk.
She looks up to me.

911
00:45:54,598 --> 00:45:57,276
She's just infatuated.
I can't help that.

912

(SIGHS)

913
00:46:02,518 --> 00:46:04,396
Look, Leigh,
I'm scared.

914
00:46:05,078 --> 00:46:07,317
I think this
whole thing has...

915
00:46:09,158 --> 00:46:12,997
I keep feeling that
there is some animal
out there stalking us.

916
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:15,917
I think he wants
to hurt us
in the worst way

917
00:46:16,919 --> 00:46:19,437
and that's got me
frightened to death.

918
00:46:23,678 --> 00:46:25,037
You really are scared,
aren't you?

919
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,437
Yeah.

920
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:28,558
Somebody finally
got to you.

921
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:32,278
Look, Leigh,
I think...

922
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:34,318
I think that this guy
beat and raped her

923
00:46:34,399 --> 00:46:37,278
because he knew that
she wouldn't testify,

924
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,798
that she wouldn't
press charges,

925
00:46:39,879 --> 00:46:41,878
because she knows
the system.

926
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,559
I mean,
she works in it.

927
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,959
She knows that
she'd be on trial.

928
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,118
And then, because
she wouldn't testify,
you would assume that

929
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,438
there was something
going on between us

930
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:56,359
and it would
cause a rift.

931
00:46:59,281 --> 00:47:01,959
That we'd be much more
vulnerable to him.

932
00:47:08,241 --> 00:47:09,600
I'm glad we talked
about this,

933
00:47:09,681 --> 00:47:11,679
because now
we can work together.

934
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:13,160
We can beat that
son of a bitch,

935
00:47:13,241 --> 00:47:16,440
the two of us together,
working as a team.

Oh, shit!

Here you go.

942
00:47:39,802 --> 00:47:41,001
I'm sorry,

943

sent this over,

00:47:44,163 --> 00:47:45,201

945
00:47:45,643 --> 00:47:46,602
Which one?

946
00:47:46,682 --> 00:47:48,321
That guy who
is just leaving.

948
00:47:51,803 --> 00:47:52,802
Excuse me.

949
00:47:53,803 --> 00:47:55,682
Hey. Cady, come here.

950
00:47:56,523 --> 00:47:58,081
Wait up a second.

951
00:47:58,323 --> 00:48:01,482
I've been in
a real bad mood lately.
Shame, ain't it?

952
00:48:01,563 --> 00:48:02,761
You know what you can do
to brighten my mood?

953
00:48:04,204 --> 00:48:05,882
No.
Get the hell
out of here.

954
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:07,842
I don't mean just
this whole town,

955
00:48:07,923 --> 00:48:09,642
I mean the whole
goddamn state.

956
00:48:09,723 --> 00:48:11,322
I don't want to see you,
I don't want to hear you

957
00:48:11,404 --> 00:48:13,203
and I don't want
to smell you.
Now, leave.

958
00:48:13,644 --> 00:48:15,242
I like...
Are you my friend?

959
00:48:15,644 --> 00:48:16,883
No, I'm not your friend.

960
00:48:17,364 --> 00:48:19,082
Oh. 'Cause I thought
maybe you were my friend

961
00:48:19,164 --> 00:48:21,243
because I like
to plan my comings
and goings with friends.

962
00:48:21,324 --> 00:48:22,443
But if you're
not my friend,

963
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:23,523
and you're planning
my comings and goings,

964
00:48:23,604 --> 00:48:24,642
I'd call that
presumptuous.

965
00:48:24,724 --> 00:48:26,803
In fact, I'd call it
downright rude,

966
00:48:26,884 --> 00:48:28,443
because I ain't
your porch-baby, buddy.

967
00:48:28,684 --> 00:48:31,203
Gee golly gosh.
I sure am sorry
I offended you,

968
00:48:31,284 --> 00:48:33,083
you white trash
piece of shit.

969
00:48:33,365 --> 00:48:35,923
Ooh-ooh. I got
the all-over fidgets
on that one.

970
00:48:36,005 --> 00:48:38,643
You've really shaken me up.
I'm shivering all over.

971
00:48:39,365 --> 00:48:40,484
Ooh.

972
00:48:40,765 --> 00:48:43,764
It's not necessary to
lay a foul tongue
on me, my friend.

973
00:48:43,845 --> 00:48:47,244
I could get upset.
Things could get
out of hand.

974
00:48:47,565 --> 00:48:50,204
And then, in self-defense,
I could do something to you

975
00:48:50,286 --> 00:48:51,884
that you would not like,
right here.

976
00:48:51,965 --> 00:48:53,924
Anytime you
feel squirrelly,
you just jump.

977
00:48:54,005 --> 00:48:57,764
You threatening me?

978
00:48:58,206 --> 00:48:59,524
You catch on fast.

979
00:49:00,206 --> 00:49:01,485
'Cause I'm well
within my rights

980
00:49:01,566 --> 00:49:02,965
to be here
and you know it.

981
00:49:03,045 --> 00:49:04,764
If I stay here,
what you going to do?

982
00:49:04,846 --> 00:49:06,925
I don't give a rat's ass
about your rights.

983
00:49:07,006 --> 00:49:09,164
You just watch your step,
and you know what
I'm talking about.

984
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:10,845
What are you gonna do?
Arrest me?

985
00:49:10,926 --> 00:49:12,684
You a cop?
Or were you a cop?

986
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:14,845
Or were you not good enough
to remain on the force?

987
00:49:14,927 --> 00:49:16,886
'Cause, you know
that's the feeling
I'm getting here.

988
00:49:19,487 --> 00:49:21,725
Hope you enjoyed
your breakfast.

989
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,086
Ma'am,
this belong to you?

990
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:32,086
LEIGH: Can I help you?

991
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:33,446
I just found it.

992
00:49:33,927 --> 00:49:36,046
I thought you
might need it back.

993
00:49:36,127 --> 00:49:38,246
Not to frighten you,
but if a dogcatcher

994
00:49:38,327 --> 00:49:39,846
comes across a dog
without a license,

995
00:49:39,928 --> 00:49:41,006
he's liable to
think he's a stray

996
00:49:41,087 --> 00:49:43,606
and do God knows
what to it.

997
00:49:44,128 --> 00:49:47,486
You know,
our dog is...

998
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:49,647
He passed away.

999
00:49:49,728 --> 00:49:51,007
Oh, what a shame.
Yeah.

closing my eyes,
I can picture him,

1002
00:49:57,528 --> 00:50:01,327
big, friendly, shaggy,
asleep at your feet,

1003
00:50:01,408 --> 00:50:03,047
keeping you company
while you're trying

1004
00:50:03,128 --> 00:50:06,047
to finish up those
pesky little sketches.

1005

Oh, you're Max Cady,
aren't you?

1006
00:50:13,529 --> 00:50:17,088
You know, you better
get the hell out of here
before I call the police.

1007
00:50:17,169 --> 00:50:18,808
I'm not doing nothing.

1008

Just giving you back
your dog collar.

1009
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:21,448
I'm not on
your property.

1010
00:50:21,529 --> 00:50:23,568
Oh, what'd you
come out here for,
you want to look around?

1011
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:25,648
Go ahead, Mr. Cady,
take a good look.

1012
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:27,649
Nice house.
Yeah.

now you've seen it?

Or is there more? Huh?

1015

Is that it?

1016
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:38,928
There is going to
be more, isn't there,
Mr. Cady? Huh?

You won't stop
until you're happy.

How can I be happy, Leigh,
when you're not happy?

1019
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:47,769
You don't know
anything about me.

1020
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:49,009
I know what I see,
ma'am.

1021
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:50,049
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

1022
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,769
I wanted to know
what you looked like.

1023
00:50:53,851 --> 00:50:55,369
I've been waiting
to see your face,

1024
00:50:55,451 --> 00:50:57,209
but you know now
that I see you,

1025
00:50:58,851 --> 00:51:00,650
you are just repulsive.

1026
00:51:01,051 --> 00:51:02,290
I understand.
Yeah.

1027
00:51:02,371 --> 00:51:04,210
I'm not your type.
No.

1028
00:51:04,291 --> 00:51:06,450
All that prison time
made me coarse.

1029
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:09,249
Guess I'm covered in
too many tattoos, huh?

1030
00:51:09,612 --> 00:51:11,251
But, you see,
there's not a whole
hell of a lot

to do in prison but
desecrate your flesh.

1032

have to be that way

hadn't betrayed us both.

We might have been
different people.

1035

been happy, Leigh.

Yeah, I told you.

00:51:55,213 --> 00:51:56,291
You know
where he was today?

1050
00:51:56,374 --> 00:51:59,332
At the public library reading
Thus Spake Zarathustra

1051

by Friedrich Nietzsche,
he's this German philosopher.

He said that
God is dead.

1053
00:52:02,694 --> 00:52:03,732
God is dead. Right.

1054

Look, we can keep
going this way,

1055

awful expensive, Sam.

00:53:17,657 --> 00:53:18,735
DANIELLE: Hello?

1080
00:53:18,817 --> 00:53:19,855
MAN ON PHONE:
Hello, Danielle?

1081
00:53:20,457 --> 00:53:21,735
Is this
Miss Danielle Bowden?

1082
00:53:21,817 --> 00:53:22,855
Yeah.

1083
00:53:23,137 --> 00:53:25,015
This is your
new teacher calling.

1084
00:53:25,097 --> 00:53:26,456
From English or Drama?

1085
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:27,536
Drama.

1086
00:53:28,297 --> 00:53:29,256
So how you doing?

1087
00:53:29,338 --> 00:53:30,297
Fine.

1088
00:53:30,618 --> 00:53:32,336
Well, I'm just
going down the list,

1089
00:53:32,457 --> 00:53:34,256
greeting my
summer students.

1090
00:53:34,698 --> 00:53:36,456
You sound kind of down.

1091
00:53:36,537 --> 00:53:37,656
No.

1092
00:53:38,818 --> 00:53:41,656
There's just been stuff
going on around here,
that's all.

1093
00:53:41,737 --> 00:53:43,296
I see.
Anything I can do?

1094
00:53:43,378 --> 00:53:44,537
I doubt it.

1095
00:53:44,618 --> 00:53:47,657
I mean,
shit happens, you know,
like the T-shirt says.

1096
00:53:47,738 --> 00:53:48,776
Yeah.

1097
00:53:49,978 --> 00:53:53,857
Well, you know, Danielle,
all that negativity,
you can use that.

1098
00:53:55,539 --> 00:53:57,058
What do you mean?

1099
00:53:57,138 --> 00:53:58,857
Well, I'm the kind
of teacher that takes

1100
00:53:58,939 --> 00:54:00,578
a very personal interest
in his kids.

1101
00:54:00,658 --> 00:54:02,217
And don't mind me if
I tell you everything

1102
00:54:02,299 --> 00:54:04,977
you're going through,
it's okay, go with it.

1103
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:06,138
The awkwardness
you feel, say,

1104
00:54:06,219 --> 00:54:07,257
when you're walking
down the street

1105
00:54:07,339 --> 00:54:10,457
and some leering fool
is making fun
of your sexuality,

1106
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,378
the turmoil you feel,
extra bad when

1107
00:54:12,459 --> 00:54:14,458
that particular time
of the month
comes around,

1108
00:54:14,539 --> 00:54:16,658
the anger you feel
that your mom and dad

1109
00:54:16,739 --> 00:54:17,898
won't let you
just grow up

1110
00:54:17,979 --> 00:54:20,058
and be yourself,
be a woman.

1111
00:54:20,459 --> 00:54:22,298
Go with it.
Don't suppress
or deny it.

1112
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:24,739
Use it in your life
and your work.

1113
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,138
Okay. I mean...

1114
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,979
That's... I'll have to
think about all that.

1115
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:36,859
So, class is tomorrow
in Room 110, right?

1116
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:40,059
No, it's been changed
to the theater.

1117
00:54:40,141 --> 00:54:42,019
I mean, what better place
for drama, right?

1118
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,339
Yeah.

1119
00:54:45,141 --> 00:54:46,540
And remember, Danielle,

1120
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:49,779
you can use all those fears
to draw upon and learn.

1121
00:54:51,061 --> 00:54:53,020
You know
this little tune?

1122
00:54:53,341 --> 00:54:54,580
WOMAN ON TAPE: (SINGING)
If you want a

1123
00:54:54,661 --> 00:55:00,940
Do-right-all-day woman

1124
00:55:02,502 --> 00:55:03,580
Woman

1125
00:55:03,982 --> 00:55:10,701
You've got to be
a do-right-all-night man

1126
00:55:12,702 --> 00:55:13,900
Man
(DANIELLE GIGGLES)

1127
00:55:14,462 --> 00:55:18,461
Now, you can trust in me,
because I'm a do-right man,
okay?

1128
00:55:20,743 --> 00:55:22,061
Okay, 'night now.

1129
00:55:22,783 --> 00:55:24,901
Okay. Good night.

1130
00:55:29,343 --> 00:55:31,422
You know, honey,
I think maybe
I should walk you in.

1131
00:55:31,503 --> 00:55:34,942
No, it's okay, Mom.
There's a lot
of people here.

1132
00:55:35,022 --> 00:55:37,021
I'll be right here
at 4:00 to pick you up.

1133
00:55:37,103 --> 00:55:38,982
Okay. Bye.
Bye.

1134
00:55:40,943 --> 00:55:43,782
I didn't think
summer session was
gonna be so crowded.

1135
00:55:43,863 --> 00:55:45,341
It's not.
They're just having
a big meeting

1136
00:55:45,424 --> 00:55:47,702
about next fall's
chorus program.

1137
00:55:47,783 --> 00:55:49,662
I have to go downstairs
for Drama. Bye.

1138
00:55:49,743 --> 00:55:51,022
Okay, bye.

1139
00:55:51,704 --> 00:55:53,223
(BELL RINGING)

1140
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:36,144
Hello.

1141
00:56:40,546 --> 00:56:41,704
Nadine?

1142
00:56:54,866 --> 00:56:58,185
I'm here for
the Drama class.

1143
00:57:04,267 --> 00:57:05,226
Hi.

1144
00:57:05,747 --> 00:57:07,026
Oops.

1145
00:57:07,267 --> 00:57:08,705
Am I busted?

1146
00:57:08,787 --> 00:57:10,345
No.
I hope not.

1147
00:57:10,746 --> 00:57:13,346
You can't smoke grass
in school.

1148
00:57:13,427 --> 00:57:15,506
Privilege of
the profession.

1149
00:57:16,628 --> 00:57:19,227
Eases inhibitions.
You down here for Drama?

1150
00:57:19,307 --> 00:57:20,345
Yeah.

1151
00:57:20,627 --> 00:57:22,866
Are you
the Drama teacher?

1152
00:57:22,948 --> 00:57:24,706
And you're,
let me guess.

1153
00:57:27,907 --> 00:57:28,946
Cecile James?

1154
00:57:29,428 --> 00:57:32,867
No, I'm Danielle Bowden.

1155
00:57:33,268 --> 00:57:35,507
Danielle.
Oh, we spoke last night.

1156
00:57:35,908 --> 00:57:36,946
Yeah.

1157
00:57:38,228 --> 00:57:40,147
Oh, I'm sorry.
How rude.

1158
00:57:41,428 --> 00:57:42,506
It's okay.

1159
00:57:42,868 --> 00:57:44,027
Um...

1160
00:57:47,629 --> 00:57:49,548
(SINGING) I think
we're alone now...

1161
00:57:49,669 --> 00:57:50,987
(CHUCKLES)

1162
00:57:53,909 --> 00:57:54,907
Okay.

1163
00:58:01,509 --> 00:58:02,708
(EXHALES)

1164
00:58:06,309 --> 00:58:08,668
Thanks. Here.

1165
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:11,428
I'm going to
give this to you.

1166
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:13,789
Ow. (LAUGHS)

1167
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:17,669
Little trick I learned.
Take it.

1168
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:22,788
You know when we spoke
on the phone last night?

1169
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:24,028
Mmm-hmm.

1170
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:27,988
You really
made sense to me

1171
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:30,629
and I thought a lot.

1172
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:32,869
Those are human truths,
darling.

1173
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:34,069
That's what
it's all about.

1174
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:36,349
And that's what
we deal with here.

1175
00:58:36,791 --> 00:58:39,030
See the book you have,
Thomas Wolfe?

1176
00:58:39,511 --> 00:58:42,510
It's all about
self-discovery,
the inner voyage.

1177
00:58:43,911 --> 00:58:45,910
I like the end

1178
00:58:46,711 --> 00:58:52,149
where Eugene's journey...
It was really mystical,
you know,

1179
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:55,790
and it was almost
like a pilgrimage.

1180
00:58:56,631 --> 00:58:58,630
Almost like a cop-out,
if you ask me.

1181
00:58:58,872 --> 00:59:01,671
Although those were
the facts of Wolfe's life.

1182
00:59:02,632 --> 00:59:05,190
The novel is
what you would call
a roman  clef.

1183
00:59:05,271 --> 00:59:07,070
You know what that is?
(SIGHS)

1184
00:59:08,592 --> 00:59:09,751
Sure.

1185
00:59:10,512 --> 00:59:12,071
Well, nonetheless,
you can't escape

1186
00:59:12,152 --> 00:59:13,871
your demons just
by leaving home.

1187
00:59:14,713 --> 00:59:17,791
Although writers
do find new freedom
when they relocate abroad.

1188
00:59:17,873 --> 00:59:20,711
Take Henry Miller.
Have you read
his trilogy?

1189
00:59:20,792 --> 00:59:22,231
Plexus, Nexus
and Sexus?

1190
00:59:23,633 --> 00:59:25,711
No. No.
You haven't
read that?

1191
00:59:26,473 --> 00:59:28,191
You're missing
something.

1192
00:59:28,633 --> 00:59:32,792
Well, you know what?
I did read
Tropic of Cancer.

1193
00:59:33,753 --> 00:59:35,272
Just parts of it,
though,

1194
00:59:35,353 --> 00:59:39,032
because I had to
sneak it off my parents'
shelf, you know?

1195
00:59:39,593 --> 00:59:43,992
But his descriptions
are pretty vivid,
I would say.

1196
00:59:44,633 --> 00:59:46,992
In one of the novels,
I don't recall which,

1197
00:59:47,074 --> 00:59:49,792
he describes an erection
as a piece of lead
with wings on it.

1198
00:59:50,914 --> 00:59:52,472
I didn't read
that part.

1199
00:59:52,554 --> 00:59:54,232
Of course not.
You're not allowed.

1200
00:59:54,314 --> 00:59:56,273
Your parents
don't want you to
achieve adulthood.

1201
00:59:56,354 --> 00:59:57,353
That's natural.

1202
00:59:57,434 --> 01:00:00,473
They know the pitfalls
of adulthood,
all that freedom.

1203
01:00:00,554 --> 01:00:02,513
They know it
only too well.

1204
01:00:03,314 --> 01:00:06,113
Temptation to stray,
deflecting their guilt
and anger onto you

1205
01:00:06,194 --> 01:00:09,513
for a crime that's
not even a crime,
for smoking grass.

1206
01:00:15,035 --> 01:00:16,473
Wait a second.

1207
01:00:18,035 --> 01:00:19,113
Where are you from?

1208
01:00:20,715 --> 01:00:21,714
Where am I from?

1209
01:00:21,795 --> 01:00:23,514
Yeah.
Where do you think
I'm from?

1210
01:00:24,435 --> 01:00:25,994
I don't know, but...

1211
01:00:26,075 --> 01:00:28,274
If I told you,
you going to
get mad at me?

1212
01:00:28,715 --> 01:00:29,753
No.

1213
01:00:35,676 --> 01:00:37,755
I'm from
the black forest.

1214
01:00:41,276 --> 01:00:42,715
That's funny.

1215
01:00:43,836 --> 01:00:46,754
You're not
the Drama teacher,
are you?

1216
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:49,435
Maybe I'm
the big bad wolf.

1217
01:00:51,476 --> 01:00:52,435
Umm...

1218
01:00:53,997 --> 01:00:57,436
So you're that guy
that's been hanging
around the house?

1219
01:00:58,077 --> 01:01:00,676
You're the one that
killed my mom's dog?

1220
01:01:01,917 --> 01:01:03,036
Your mom's dog
was killed?

1221
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:04,236
Yeah.

1222
01:01:04,957 --> 01:01:07,436
I didn't even know
anything about that.

1223
01:01:07,517 --> 01:01:08,956
That's a shame.

1224
01:01:09,557 --> 01:01:10,755
That's a damn shame.

1225
01:01:11,678 --> 01:01:13,037
Yes, it was.

1226
01:01:13,318 --> 01:01:15,196
What kind
of dog was it?

1227
01:01:15,958 --> 01:01:18,157
I don't know.
He was just...

1228
01:01:18,238 --> 01:01:20,356
He was fluffy, and...

1229
01:01:21,718 --> 01:01:22,876
Fluffy?

1230
01:01:23,838 --> 01:01:25,237
Mmm-hmm.

1231
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,276
So you didn't do that?

1232
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:31,356
Of course
I didn't do that.

1233
01:01:35,998 --> 01:01:37,237
Okay.

1234
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:38,558
I wouldn't do that.

1235
01:01:39,438 --> 01:01:41,997
So why... What are
you doing here, then?

1236
01:01:42,279 --> 01:01:45,357
Well, I came to meet you,
to be honest with you.

1237
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:50,078
Why? I mean...

1238
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:51,118
Because

1239
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:55,918
I wanted to meet you,
see what you're like.

1240
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,879
I see you're
a nice person.
That's all.

1241
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,678
You're not going
to hurt me, are you?

1242
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,679
I'm not going to
hurt you at all.

1243
01:02:05,759 --> 01:02:07,758
There's no
hurting here, Danielle.

1244
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,318
Between us,
there's no anger,
nothing.

1245
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,319
Just a search
for truth.

1246
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,359
I mean, did you judge me,
did you get angry at me

1247
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,039
when you caught me
smoking the grass?

1248
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,198
Hmm?

1249
01:02:20,281 --> 01:02:21,319
No.

1250
01:02:22,721 --> 01:02:24,559
But your parents,
they judged you.

1251
01:02:24,641 --> 01:02:26,680
They got plenty angry
at you, didn't they?

1252
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:27,919
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.

1253
01:02:28,481 --> 01:02:30,840
They punished you
for their sins.

1254
01:02:31,841 --> 01:02:33,200
What did they do?

1255
01:02:33,281 --> 01:02:34,400
They...

1256
01:02:35,401 --> 01:02:38,640
My dad...
They just yelled
a whole lot

1257
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:41,240
and my mom cried

1258
01:02:41,321 --> 01:02:44,719
and my dad said
I couldn't drive
the Cherokee.

1259
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:47,080
I would say
they punished you
for their sins,

1260
01:02:47,162 --> 01:02:48,440
and you resent that,

1261
01:02:48,522 --> 01:02:50,441
and you should
resent it.

1262
01:02:51,242 --> 01:02:54,401
But Professor do-right has
a little advice for you.

1263
01:02:54,762 --> 01:02:56,240
You shouldn't
damn them.

1264
01:02:56,322 --> 01:02:58,001
Don't judge them.
Just forgive them,

1265
01:02:58,082 --> 01:03:00,041
for they know not
what they do.

1266
01:03:01,602 --> 01:03:02,961
Oh...
Um...

1267
01:03:03,042 --> 01:03:04,240
Why do you
hate my father?

1268
01:03:04,602 --> 01:03:07,841
I don't hate him at all.
Oh, no. I pray for him.

1269
01:03:08,482 --> 01:03:10,201
I'm here to help him.

1270
01:03:10,603 --> 01:03:13,521
I mean, we all
make mistakes,
Danielle.

1271
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:16,762
You and I have.
But at least we try
to admit it.

1272
01:03:17,123 --> 01:03:18,402
Don't we?

1273
01:03:18,803 --> 01:03:19,922
Yeah.

1274
01:03:20,403 --> 01:03:22,122
But your daddy,
he don't.

1275
01:03:23,683 --> 01:03:27,282
Every man carries
a circle of hell around
his head like a halo.

1276
01:03:27,363 --> 01:03:28,482
Your daddy, too.

1277
01:03:28,603 --> 01:03:33,362
Every man, every man
has to go through hell
to reach his paradise.

1278
01:03:34,123 --> 01:03:36,042
You know
what paradise is?

1279
01:03:36,683 --> 01:03:38,202
No.
Salvation.

1280
01:03:39,684 --> 01:03:41,603
'Cause your daddy's
not happy.

1281
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:43,043
Your mommy's
not happy.

1282
01:03:43,564 --> 01:03:46,643
And you know what?
You're not happy.

1283
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:49,202
Are you?

1284
01:03:49,285 --> 01:03:50,363
No, I'm not.

1285
01:03:55,005 --> 01:03:56,924
You thought about me
last night, didn't you?

1286
01:03:57,004 --> 01:03:58,243
(LAUGHS)

1287
01:04:00,205 --> 01:04:01,164
Um...

1288
01:04:02,245 --> 01:04:03,323
Yes, I did.

1289
01:04:04,165 --> 01:04:05,284
I know.

1290
01:04:07,765 --> 01:04:11,003
You know, I think
I might have
found a companion,

1291
01:04:12,285 --> 01:04:15,083
a companion for
that long walk
to the light.

1292
01:04:18,046 --> 01:04:20,365
Do you mind if
I put my arm
around you?

1293
01:04:24,565 --> 01:04:25,684
Um...

1294
01:04:33,326 --> 01:04:34,605
It's okay.

1295
01:04:36,646 --> 01:04:38,245
No, I don't mind.

1296
01:04:39,327 --> 01:04:40,485
Okay.

1297
01:04:53,887 --> 01:04:55,126
(GIGGLES)

1298
01:05:51,009 --> 01:05:52,248
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1299
01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:06,969
Kersek, where the hell
have you been,
for Christ sake?

1300
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:08,409
He came at my daughter
at school.

1301
01:06:08,491 --> 01:06:09,489
You asked me to
watch him nights.

1302
01:06:09,571 --> 01:06:11,650
I'm watching him nights.
What happened?

1303
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:14,168
My wife, Leigh,
she found some marijuana

1304
01:06:14,251 --> 01:06:15,529
in one of
Dani's schoolbooks.

1305
01:06:15,611 --> 01:06:18,329
We don't know if Cady
gave it to her or
exactly what happened,

1306
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:20,089
but she's scared and
she won't talk about it.

1307
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:22,409
But now this has
gone far enough.
It's got to stop!

1308
01:06:22,491 --> 01:06:23,450
You phone the cops?

1309
01:06:23,531 --> 01:06:24,969
No, I didn't
phone the cops.

1310
01:06:25,051 --> 01:06:26,170
I mean, what did
you call them?

1311
01:06:26,251 --> 01:06:28,090
You call them "Slow,
skeptical, pathetic, even."

1312
01:06:28,211 --> 01:06:29,929
Dani.
No, Leigh,
that's all right.

1313
01:06:30,011 --> 01:06:31,810
Just hold on a minute.

1314
01:06:33,691 --> 01:06:36,690
Kersek, look,
I want to hire
those three guys,

1315
01:06:36,771 --> 01:06:38,290
you remember,
the hospital job.

1316
01:06:38,372 --> 01:06:40,971
Consider it done,
the sooner the better.

1317
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:43,330
Three men's going
to cost you a grand.

1318
01:06:43,412 --> 01:06:44,531
Now I know that's
not chicken feed,

1319
01:06:44,612 --> 01:06:46,051
but you don't wanna go
with less than three.

1320
01:06:46,132 --> 01:06:48,091
It's better to
overdo it.

1321
01:06:48,172 --> 01:06:49,891
Okay.
You'll have the money
in the morning.

1322
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:51,611
All right.
Then we'll be on
for tomorrow night.

1323
01:06:51,692 --> 01:06:54,810
And Sam,
you'll feel good
about this.

1324
01:06:58,413 --> 01:06:59,491
All right.

1325
01:07:12,013 --> 01:07:14,333
Do you notice
these young people?

1326
01:07:14,413 --> 01:07:15,851
They don't
look very happy.

1327
01:07:15,933 --> 01:07:18,451
They're committed
to their professions
and to their ambitions,

1328
01:07:18,533 --> 01:07:19,932
but they're not
committed to each other.

1329
01:07:20,013 --> 01:07:21,932
Cady, shut up
and listen.

1330
01:07:23,334 --> 01:07:25,052
If you don't leave...

1331
01:07:25,493 --> 01:07:27,292
If you don't
leave my family alone

1332
01:07:27,373 --> 01:07:29,412
and if you don't
get out of here,

1333
01:07:29,494 --> 01:07:32,493
you're going to be hurting
like you never dreamed.

1334
01:07:34,374 --> 01:07:35,333
Could you repeat that?

1335
01:07:35,414 --> 01:07:36,413
I said,

1336
01:07:36,494 --> 01:07:38,573
if you don't
get out of here,

1337
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:40,933
you're going to be hurting
like you never dreamed.

1338
01:07:41,615 --> 01:07:43,134
A threat?
Yeah.

1339
01:07:43,214 --> 01:07:44,893
You bet your ass
that's a threat.

1340
01:07:44,974 --> 01:07:46,852
Well,
I have thought
of relocating

1341
01:07:46,935 --> 01:07:49,854
somewhere where I'd
be more appreciated,
California, perhaps.

1342
01:07:49,935 --> 01:07:52,493
I could teach
earthquake preparedness.

1343
01:07:52,975 --> 01:07:56,373
But then it hits me,
I love New Essex,
Counselor.

1344
01:07:57,575 --> 01:07:59,614
I mean,
where else could
I just casually confer

1345
01:07:59,695 --> 01:08:00,814
with an old colleague?

1346
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:04,133
We're not colleagues.
Do you understand that?
We're not colleagues.

1347
01:08:04,215 --> 01:08:05,293
Still think you're
better than me.

1348
01:08:05,375 --> 01:08:06,614
No, I don't think
I'm better than you.

1349
01:08:06,696 --> 01:08:08,095
That's not
the goddamned point.

1350
01:08:08,175 --> 01:08:09,974
Good. 'Cause if
you're not better than me,

1351
01:08:10,055 --> 01:08:11,694
then I can have
what you have.

1352
01:08:12,416 --> 01:08:13,454
What do I have?

1353
01:08:13,816 --> 01:08:15,495
A wife, a daughter.

1354
01:08:17,776 --> 01:08:20,815
I'm going to teach you
the meaning of commitment.

1355
01:08:21,136 --> 01:08:23,175
Fourteen years ago,
I was forced to make

1356
01:08:23,256 --> 01:08:25,014
a commitment to
an eight-by-nine cell

1357
01:08:25,097 --> 01:08:28,015
and now you're
going to be forced
to make a commitment.

1358
01:08:28,097 --> 01:08:30,455
You could say I'm here
to save you.

1359
01:08:33,616 --> 01:08:34,655
Fine.

1360
01:08:36,017 --> 01:08:37,775
Check out the Bible,
Counselor,

1361
01:08:37,857 --> 01:08:39,575
the book between
Esther and Psalms.

1362
01:08:46,297 --> 01:08:48,015
Dani? Dani?

1363
01:08:50,377 --> 01:08:51,816
You all right?

1364
01:08:52,737 --> 01:08:54,016
What?
Is everything
all right?

1365
01:08:54,097 --> 01:08:55,136
Yeah.

1366
01:08:58,258 --> 01:09:00,376
This isn't going
to work, you know.

1367
01:09:00,458 --> 01:09:01,857
What isn't going
to work?

1368
01:09:02,098 --> 01:09:04,496
Locking us in,
hiding us from the world.

1369
01:09:04,818 --> 01:09:06,416
Oh, don't be
so dramatic, Dani.

1370
01:09:06,738 --> 01:09:08,257
Making me stay out
of school.

1371
01:09:08,338 --> 01:09:10,177
You're going back
to school tomorrow.

1372
01:09:10,258 --> 01:09:11,336
And put
some clothes on.

1373
01:09:11,418 --> 01:09:12,856
You're not
a little kid anymore.

1374
01:09:13,018 --> 01:09:15,497
Yeah? Then why
am I going back
to school tomorrow?

1375
01:09:15,578 --> 01:09:16,777
What are you
going to do?

1376
01:09:16,858 --> 01:09:19,217
That's none of
your concern, Dani.

1377
01:09:21,218 --> 01:09:25,617
Dad, he didn't
force himself
on me, you know.

1378
01:09:26,539 --> 01:09:28,337
I know you'd like
to think that he did.

1379
01:09:29,539 --> 01:09:31,257
But I think he was...

1380
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:35,418
I think he was
just trying to make
a connection with me.

1381
01:09:35,699 --> 01:09:36,697
You know?
Now, Dani,

1382
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:38,738
I want you to
listen to me.

1383
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:41,298
All right? No.
Do you understand?

1384
01:09:41,779 --> 01:09:45,498
No. There will never
be any connection

1385
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:48,459
between you
and Max Cady.

1386
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:51,698
You understand that?

1387
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:02,098
Did he touch you?

1388
01:10:02,581 --> 01:10:03,700
(CHUCKLES)

1389
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:08,580
What are you
laughing about?
Why are you smiling?

1390
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:11,179
I'm asking you a question.
Did he touch you?

1391
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:14,099
Dani, wipe that
smile off your face!

1392
01:10:14,181 --> 01:10:16,460
I'm asking you,
did he touch you?

1393
01:10:22,981 --> 01:10:25,100
No, no, no, wait, Dani.
I'm sorry.

1394
01:10:25,782 --> 01:10:27,220
No, I'm sorry.

1395
01:10:28,301 --> 01:10:30,059
Wait, honey.
I'm sorry.

1396
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:32,540
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

1397
01:10:37,582 --> 01:10:38,700
(DOOR CLOSES)

1398
01:10:55,182 --> 01:10:56,301

(GRUNTING)

1400
01:11:36,184 --> 01:11:38,783
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1401
01:11:38,904 --> 01:11:40,143
Come on.

1405
01:12:13,826 --> 01:12:15,144
Is that you?

1406
01:12:16,586 --> 01:12:17,864
Counselor?

1407
01:12:18,866 --> 01:12:21,665
(SINGSONG VOICE)
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1408
01:12:35,627 --> 01:12:37,505
I ain't no white trash
piece of shit.

1409
01:12:37,587 --> 01:12:39,465
I'm better
than you all.

1410
01:12:42,267 --> 01:12:43,946
I can out-learn you.

1411
01:12:45,347 --> 01:12:47,225
I can out-read you.

1412
01:12:47,308 --> 01:12:51,827
I can outthink you,
and I can
out-philosophize you.

1413
01:12:52,108 --> 01:12:54,346
And I'm going
to outlast you.

1414
01:12:54,428 --> 01:12:55,746
You think
a couple of whacks

1415
01:12:55,828 --> 01:12:58,386
to my good-old-boy gut's
gonna get me down?

1416
01:12:58,868 --> 01:13:01,067
It's going to
take a hell of a lot more
than that, Counselor,

1417
01:13:01,148 --> 01:13:03,306
to prove you're
better than me!

1418
01:13:05,549 --> 01:13:09,587
"I am like God,
and God like me.

"I am as large as God.

Counselor?

1428
01:13:54,911 --> 01:13:56,749
I wonder
if you're here.

1429
01:14:05,911 --> 01:14:07,069
Fuck it.

1430
01:14:08,391 --> 01:14:11,350
If you're here,
what the fuck's
the difference?

1431
01:14:12,231 --> 01:14:13,430
Fuck it!

1432
01:14:23,351 --> 01:14:24,550
WOMAN: I've got
Mr. Kersek on one.

1433
01:14:24,632 --> 01:14:25,791
SAM: Good.
I'll take it.

1434
01:14:25,872 --> 01:14:26,910
Tom.

1435
01:14:27,792 --> 01:14:29,431
Sam, you look tired.
You get that writ?

1436
01:14:29,511 --> 01:14:32,750
No, no, we got to
get into that.
Let me just grab this.

1437
01:14:32,832 --> 01:14:34,551
Kersek.
Look, I'm damn sorry
about last night.

1438
01:14:34,632 --> 01:14:35,671
That son of a bitch
could survive

1439
01:14:35,752 --> 01:14:36,830
a preemptive
nuclear strike.

1440
01:14:36,913 --> 01:14:38,151
All right.
Hang on a second.
Hang on a second.

1441
01:14:38,632 --> 01:14:40,671
Tom, I'm not doing it.
I pulled a fast one

1442
01:14:40,753 --> 01:14:43,231
and it's come back and
it's bit me on the ass
in a major way.

1443
01:14:43,313 --> 01:14:44,312
What you did was dumb.

1444
01:14:44,393 --> 01:14:47,392
What I'm asking here
is no big deal, Sam.
This is my daughter!

1445
01:14:47,713 --> 01:14:49,072
No, Tom, it's perjury
and it's bullshit

1446
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:50,551
and I'm not doing it!
Now, excuse me.

1447
01:14:50,993 --> 01:14:52,672
All right?
All right.
I'll be in my office.

1448
01:14:53,273 --> 01:14:54,912
Tom, who was that
top criminal lawyer?

1449
01:14:54,993 --> 01:14:56,671
Lee Heller.
Kersek.

1450
01:14:56,753 --> 01:14:57,872
We need to talk.
KERSEK: Trouble is

1451
01:14:57,953 --> 01:15:00,152
if word gets out
how Cady bushwhacked
those poor bastards,

1452
01:15:00,233 --> 01:15:01,712
it's gonna be
a bitch to line up
three new guys.

1453
01:15:01,793 --> 01:15:04,192
I don't want three new guys.
No more guys, you hear me?

1454
01:15:04,273 --> 01:15:05,991
Mr. Heller,
it's Sam Bowden

1455
01:15:06,074 --> 01:15:07,713
from Broadbent
and Denmeyer.

1456
01:15:08,633 --> 01:15:09,831
Tom speaks
very highly of you.

1457
01:15:09,914 --> 01:15:11,112
In fact,
he says you're the best,

1458
01:15:11,194 --> 01:15:12,352
and the best is
what I need right now.

1459
01:15:12,434 --> 01:15:14,592
HELLER: (ON PHONE)
We froze our butts
together in Korea.

1460
01:15:14,674 --> 01:15:15,953
How can I help you,
Sam?

1461
01:15:16,034 --> 01:15:18,673
Well, it's a simple petition
for a restraining order,

1462
01:15:18,754 --> 01:15:20,473
but there's been
some complications.

1463
01:15:20,554 --> 01:15:21,873
Now,
I know this is
short notice,

1464
01:15:21,954 --> 01:15:23,793
but look,
I need this injunction.

1465
01:15:23,874 --> 01:15:26,353
You see,
there's an ex-convict
by the name of Max Cady,

1466
01:15:26,434 --> 01:15:27,433
he's been
harassing my family.

1467
01:15:27,515 --> 01:15:30,913
I'm sorry, Mr. Bowden.
I can't continue
this conversation.

1468
01:15:30,994 --> 01:15:32,633
Well, is there
a more convenient time?

1469
01:15:32,715 --> 01:15:35,194
No, no. The damn thing
is I have a conflict.

1470
01:15:35,275 --> 01:15:36,993
Now, what would
that be?
Well, you see,

1471
01:15:37,075 --> 01:15:39,793
Mr. Cady retained
my services
as of yesterday.

1472
01:15:39,875 --> 01:15:40,874
He what?

1473
01:15:40,955 --> 01:15:42,793
In fact,
I see on my phone sheet

1474
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:44,353
Mr. Cady called
this morning,

1475
01:15:44,435 --> 01:15:45,474
so I'm sure
he'll fill me in...

1476
01:15:45,555 --> 01:15:49,034
But wait a minute, Lee.
Now, look, this man
is a psychotic.

1477
01:15:49,115 --> 01:15:52,513
It appears
I'll be seeing you at
that hearing after all.

1478
01:15:54,236 --> 01:15:55,394
CADY ON TAPE:
Could you repeat that?

1479
01:15:55,476 --> 01:15:57,555
SAM ON TAPE: I said
if you don't leave...

1480
01:15:58,516 --> 01:16:00,274
If you don't
leave my family alone

1481
01:16:00,356 --> 01:16:02,435
and if you don't
get out of here,

1482
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:05,475
you're gonna be hurting
like you never dreamed.

1483
01:16:06,436 --> 01:16:07,354
A threat?

1484
01:16:07,436 --> 01:16:09,756
Yeah, you bet your ass
that's a threat.

1485
01:16:10,916 --> 01:16:14,835
HELLER:
You need only glance
at my client to know

1486
01:16:15,637 --> 01:16:17,755
that Mr. Bowden
made good

1487
01:16:17,837 --> 01:16:21,035
on his heinous
and cowardly threat.

1488
01:16:21,557 --> 01:16:23,795
Just as God arose
to judgment

1489
01:16:23,877 --> 01:16:25,595
to save all the meek
of the earth,

1490
01:16:25,676 --> 01:16:28,475
I hope and pray
you will do
the same, sir.

1491
01:16:28,557 --> 01:16:30,076
Your Honor,
(CLEARS THROAT)

1492
01:16:30,797 --> 01:16:33,876
Mr. Cady wouldn't
have surreptitiously
taped our meeting

1493
01:16:33,957 --> 01:16:35,996
unless he knew
that he'd...

1494
01:16:37,598 --> 01:16:41,316
This court
does not condone

1495
01:16:42,238 --> 01:16:46,116
feuds, vendettas
or vigilantism.

1496
01:16:46,678 --> 01:16:51,277
Let me quote our
great Negro educator,
Mr. Booker T. Washington.

1497
01:16:52,038 --> 01:16:56,117
"I will let no man
drag me down so low

1498
01:16:57,238 --> 01:16:59,557
"as to make me
hate him."

1499
01:16:59,639 --> 01:17:00,677
Yes.

1500
01:17:01,478 --> 01:17:04,037
I will grant
the restraining order

1501
01:17:04,118 --> 01:17:07,477
not to validate
the malice between you,

1502
01:17:07,559 --> 01:17:12,438
but in the interest
of Christian harmony.

1503
01:17:13,959 --> 01:17:16,918
You may not come
within 500 yards

1504
01:17:16,999 --> 01:17:21,398
of Mr. Maximilian Cady

1505
01:17:22,119 --> 01:17:26,678
until such time
as the court may
lift the injunction.

1506
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:32,038
King Solomon could
not have adjudicated
more wisely, Your Honor.

1507
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:37,278
I am so offended by
the philistine tactics
of Mr. Bowden,

1508
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:41,398
I petitioned the A. B.A.
For his disbarment

1509
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:43,799
on the grounds of
moral turpitude.

1510
01:17:44,121 --> 01:17:47,000
Now, if you will
excuse us, my client...

1511
01:17:47,081 --> 01:17:48,040
Come on, son...

1512
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:49,799
Is due back
at the hospital

1513
01:17:52,321 --> 01:17:56,560
for the results of
his numerous X-rays.

1514
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:00,119
Kersek, I want a gun.

1515
01:18:00,561 --> 01:18:01,719
I need a gun.
I want a gun.

1516
01:18:01,801 --> 01:18:02,919
You want a gun?

1517
01:18:03,001 --> 01:18:04,039
Yeah, I need a gun.

1518
01:18:04,682 --> 01:18:05,720
Know anything
about guns?
No.

1519
01:18:05,801 --> 01:18:06,840
No, I don't believe
in them.

1520
01:18:06,921 --> 01:18:08,320
I never had them
around the house
or anything.

1521
01:18:08,401 --> 01:18:09,400
All right,
I'll get you a gun.

1522
01:18:09,482 --> 01:18:10,841
What kind of
gun you want?
Now, calm down.

1523
01:18:10,921 --> 01:18:12,840
Well, just something simple,
something I can handle.

1524
01:18:12,922 --> 01:18:15,801
Let me see
what fits you. A.45...

1525
01:18:15,882 --> 01:18:17,121
Let me see your hands.
Okay.

1526
01:18:18,922 --> 01:18:21,080
A.38 snub-nosed
special. Yeah.
All right. Good.

1527
01:18:21,162 --> 01:18:23,321
That'll do. I can even
teach you how to use it.

1528
01:18:23,402 --> 01:18:25,201
All right. Great.
The first lesson
is this.

1529
01:18:25,682 --> 01:18:27,961
Don't think of it
as shooting a man
or trying to kill him.

1530
01:18:28,082 --> 01:18:30,041
Right.
Think of it as
an extension of your fist.

1531
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:32,041
You're just reaching out
and knocking the man down.

1532
01:18:32,682 --> 01:18:33,641
All right.

1533
01:18:33,723 --> 01:18:35,762
Later on we can
go out to the woods
and shoot some trees, okay?

1534
01:18:35,842 --> 01:18:38,401
That'd be great.
That'd be great. Good.

1535
01:18:40,443 --> 01:18:42,122
What is it? What?

1536
01:18:42,203 --> 01:18:43,961
Well, Sam...
Yeah?

1537
01:18:44,043 --> 01:18:46,401
I give you a gun.
You pull it on Cady,

1538
01:18:46,483 --> 01:18:47,482
and it's gonna
dawn on you

1539
01:18:47,563 --> 01:18:48,522
that shooting a man
is different

1540
01:18:48,603 --> 01:18:50,322
than blowing holes
in some tree.

1541
01:18:50,403 --> 01:18:52,522
Next thing, you know,
you don't have my gun,
Cady does.

1542
01:18:53,003 --> 01:18:54,002
No, no, no.
You're gonna teach me.

1543
01:18:54,083 --> 01:18:55,442
I know how
to handle a gun.

1544
01:18:55,524 --> 01:18:56,602
He won't take it
away from me.

1545
01:18:56,683 --> 01:18:59,522
Best-case scenario,
you kill Cady dog-dead.

1546
01:19:00,484 --> 01:19:03,722
Fifteen years to life.
Do you realize that,
Counselor?

1547
01:19:09,284 --> 01:19:12,042
Oh, Jesus!
It's all fucked up,
Kersek!

1548
01:19:12,884 --> 01:19:14,083
I mean,
the law considers me

1549
01:19:14,164 --> 01:19:15,922
more of a loose cannon
than Max Cady!

1550
01:19:16,005 --> 01:19:18,204
Some big-shit attorney
has whipped

1551
01:19:18,284 --> 01:19:20,442
the A. B.A.'s
ethics committee
into a frenzy.

1552
01:19:20,925 --> 01:19:23,643
There's an emergency session
in Raleigh over the assault.

1553
01:19:24,004 --> 01:19:25,643
How did they link that
to you?

1554
01:19:25,805 --> 01:19:29,764
I went to warn Cady.
I thought it was
the decent thing to do.

1555
01:19:29,845 --> 01:19:32,683
Maybe I'd scare him.
And he was wired.

1556
01:19:35,325 --> 01:19:37,083
Goddamn fools.

1557
01:19:40,406 --> 01:19:42,205
This hearing,
it's real important?

1558

(LAUGHS)

1559
01:19:44,366 --> 01:19:47,724
Only if I want to continue
to practice law. Yeah.

1560
01:19:48,805 --> 01:19:49,804
Cady isn't
expected there, is he?

1561
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:53,445
Oh, no, no, no.
Mr. Cady,
he's beyond reproach.

1562
01:19:53,566 --> 01:19:55,164
But you're required
to be there.
Yeah.

1563
01:19:56,406 --> 01:19:57,405
When is this hearing?

1564
01:19:57,486 --> 01:19:59,485
It's Thursday morning,
9:00.

1565
01:19:59,566 --> 01:20:02,205
The torture begins
and lasts for two days.

1566
01:20:03,366 --> 01:20:04,605
You have to fly up
the night before?

1567
01:20:05,526 --> 01:20:06,645
Right.

1568
01:20:07,527 --> 01:20:09,245
Cady's an opportunist.

1569
01:20:09,327 --> 01:20:11,205
If he thinks
you're gonna be out
of town for two days,

1570
01:20:11,286 --> 01:20:13,886
that's going to be
as tempting to him
as shit is to a fly.

1571
01:20:14,607 --> 01:20:16,126
If Cady breaks
into your home,

1572
01:20:16,207 --> 01:20:17,846
he can be killed.

1573
01:20:17,927 --> 01:20:19,245
Justifiably.

1574
01:20:21,207 --> 01:20:23,846
But he won't show
unless he's real sure
you're not gonna be there.

All right. Bye-bye.

Call us tonight, okay?

01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:35,329
All right.

1581
01:21:45,331 --> 01:21:46,850
I didn't miss
the 9:20 to Raleigh?

1582
01:21:46,931 --> 01:21:49,130
I'm afraid you did, sir.
But there's a 10:20.

1583
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:50,249
Oh, it's not that.

1584
01:21:50,331 --> 01:21:53,170
I just have some very,
very important papers
for Samuel Bowden.

1585
01:21:53,651 --> 01:21:54,849
Was he on the 9:20?

1586
01:21:55,731 --> 01:21:57,370
We can't give out
that information, sir.

1587
01:21:58,131 --> 01:21:59,570
Well, it's just...

1588
01:22:00,331 --> 01:22:02,130
I guess I could send it
to him overnight,

1589
01:22:02,212 --> 01:22:05,810
but he might be back,
for all I know,
tomorrow morning, and I...

1590
01:22:07,092 --> 01:22:08,371
See, I...

1591
01:22:08,732 --> 01:22:11,891
My wife and I have
been in an accident,
and he's our lawyer.

1592
01:22:11,972 --> 01:22:15,970
And if I don't get
in touch with him,
we could lose this case.

1593
01:22:16,052 --> 01:22:18,850
We've already lost
our little daughter, Dani.

1594

Is...

1595
01:22:22,773 --> 01:22:23,892
Is there any way
I can find out

1596
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:26,571
if he was on that flight
and when he's coming back?

1597
01:22:26,652 --> 01:22:28,691
It'd really,
really help us.

(KEYS CLATTERING)

after tomorrow, sir.

(BANGING ON DOOR)
Leigh. Leigh,

You better
slow down, Sam.

1605
01:23:12,614 --> 01:23:14,493
You're outpacing me
two-to-one since
you started smoking.

1606
01:23:14,575 --> 01:23:17,094
Just keep track of
how many I owe you.

1607
01:23:18,935 --> 01:23:20,013
So, how'd it go
at the airport?

1608
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:21,253
Well, we did our thing,

1609
01:23:21,335 --> 01:23:22,613
but we don't know
if he saw us,

1610
01:23:22,695 --> 01:23:24,654
we don't even know
if he was there.

1611
01:23:25,135 --> 01:23:27,094
Set the trap
and we'll see.

1612
01:23:27,615 --> 01:23:28,734
What if we don't
want to see?

1613
01:23:29,095 --> 01:23:30,414
Dani!
DANIELLE: What?

1614
01:23:30,696 --> 01:23:32,494
Maybe he
poisoned the dog.

1615
01:23:32,815 --> 01:23:34,693
Dani...
Sam, watch out
for the windows.

1616
01:23:34,776 --> 01:23:37,655
Yeah, you're not
allowed to stand up,
Dad, remember?

1617
01:23:43,976 --> 01:23:45,095
Didn't Cady
go after her?

1618
01:23:45,176 --> 01:23:46,295
LEIGH:
You don't know Dani.

1619
01:23:46,376 --> 01:23:48,295
If she finds
a palmetto bug
in her bedroom,

1620
01:23:48,376 --> 01:23:50,054
she takes it outside.

1621
01:23:50,136 --> 01:23:52,414
You know, she could
never kill anything.

1622
01:23:52,497 --> 01:23:53,895
Even a six-foot
palmetto bug?

1623

(LAUGHS)

01:23:56,697 --> 01:23:58,135
Oh, God.

1625
01:24:06,577 --> 01:24:07,576
What is that?

1626
01:24:08,777 --> 01:24:12,096
It's a monofilament line.
I got it from
Sam's fishing gear.

1627
01:24:12,177 --> 01:24:14,735
See, what I do is
I stretch it across
the windows and the doors

1628
01:24:14,817 --> 01:24:16,736
and tie it to
Dani's teddy bear here.

1629
01:24:16,817 --> 01:24:18,336
If the bear moves
a quarter of an inch,

1630
01:24:18,418 --> 01:24:19,896
I'll know
if the holy ghost
is sneaking in.

1631

What are you reading?

1632
01:24:56,419 --> 01:24:57,538
Why? Did Kersek quit?

1633
01:24:57,619 --> 01:24:58,657
No.

1634
01:24:59,659 --> 01:25:01,417
It's just
that Cady said...

1635
01:25:01,499 --> 01:25:03,258
You want some answers.

1636
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:05,858
Me, too.

1637
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:12,738
I'd like to know just
how strong we are
or how weak.

1638
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:16,979
But I guess
the only way we're going
to find that out

1639
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:20,099
is just by
going through this.

1640
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:27,418
It's just that Cady said
to read the book between
Esther and Psalms.

1641
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:29,859
Which is which one?

1642
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:31,899
The Book of Job.

1643
01:25:34,941 --> 01:25:37,659
Job was a good man.
He believed in God

1644
01:25:38,741 --> 01:25:40,660
and God tested
his faith.

1645
01:25:41,061 --> 01:25:43,260
He took away
everything he had,

1646
01:25:44,822 --> 01:25:46,500
even his children.

to the houseboat,

1657
01:26:29,663 --> 01:26:31,302
Don't stay outside.

01:26:37,744 --> 01:26:41,983
You wanna know what
really disturbs me?
It's killing this guy.

taking a man's life.

I don't know if
I can live with that.

You may have to.

1662
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:53,863
Sam, just remember
the plan.
I know the plan.

1663
01:26:54,784 --> 01:26:57,183
Damn, it's premeditated.
It's...

1664
01:26:57,505 --> 01:27:00,703
It makes me an accomplice,
an accessory, an abettor.

1665
01:27:01,264 --> 01:27:02,983
It's also excessive force.

1666
01:27:03,345 --> 01:27:05,744
Sam,
the only thing excessive
we could do to Cady

1667
01:27:05,825 --> 01:27:08,624
would be to gut him
and eat his liver.

1668
01:27:08,705 --> 01:27:09,783
That might
be excessive.

Kersek, I'm serious.

1670

No, you're scared.

1671

But that's okay.
I want you to
savor that fear.

1672
01:27:18,785 --> 01:27:20,904

the South evolved in fear.

Fear of the Indian,
fear of the slave,
fear of the damn Union.

there's a thing

It means
an unforeseeable act of God

so commonplace
and dreary.

we have an opportunity.

"What is that opportunity?"
You ask.

1852
01:44:26,150 --> 01:44:28,349
Why, here and now,
we have an opportunity

1853
01:44:28,430 --> 01:44:31,309
to depict
and dramatize...

and the depths

of her daughter,
if you all get my meaning.

1857

Come on, darling.
Let's go.

Get out.
Get up here.

1859
01:44:46,630 --> 01:44:47,869

Don't you step on my lines.

Listen to me, Max.
Listen to me.

1865
01:45:05,232 --> 01:45:08,350
You know, Max,
since all this started,

1866
01:45:08,431 --> 01:45:09,990
I've thought
about you all the time.

1867
01:45:10,351 --> 01:45:15,430
I've tried to imagine
what it must have
been like for you

1868
01:45:15,512 --> 01:45:17,151
all those years,
locked up in jail.

1869
01:45:17,792 --> 01:45:22,631
I've tried
to imagine you
and even your crimes

1870
01:45:22,712 --> 01:45:25,991
and how you must have felt
in those moments
that you did them.

1871
01:45:27,072 --> 01:45:30,631
See, I know
about loss, Max.

1872
01:45:30,713 --> 01:45:35,151
I know about losing time,
even losing years.

1873
01:45:35,953 --> 01:45:39,232
And I know it
doesn't compare to jail,

1874
01:45:39,313 --> 01:45:44,471
but I can understand
and I could
share this with you.

1875
01:45:45,113 --> 01:45:49,271
Because of that,
whatever it is
that you've got planned,

1876
01:45:50,033 --> 01:45:52,272
I want you to do
it just with me,

1877
01:45:53,754 --> 01:45:55,192
not with her,

1878
01:45:55,993 --> 01:46:00,592

this connection.

1882

I wanna thank you

when you're hitting him

Because he's
perjuring himself,

He knows damn well
exactly what it said.

Don't you?

1921
01:48:43,161 --> 01:48:44,879
It said that
she was promiscuous.

1922
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:47,319
It said that she had
three different lovers
in one month.

At least three!
At least three!

And did you show
this report to the D. A?

No, no!

1926

by chance when I started

But there it was
in the court file.

But back in '77,
you buried it,

Would you care to
tell the jury why?

Would you care to
tell the court why?

1932
01:49:13,242 --> 01:49:15,881
Because I know
he brutally raped her
and he beat her.

01:49:15,962 --> 01:49:17,721
Talk to me!
I'm standing here!

1934
01:49:18,722 --> 01:49:20,201
Just because she
was promiscuous

1935
01:49:20,282 --> 01:49:21,681
didn't give you
the right to rape her!

1936
01:49:21,762 --> 01:49:23,801
You bragged to me
that you beat two prior

1937
01:49:23,883 --> 01:49:25,361

You were a menace!

into our dreams.

2003
01:57:51,824 --> 01:57:55,062
And me, I hardly dream
about him anymore.

2004
01:57:56,705 --> 01:58:00,264
Still, things won't
ever be the way they were
before he came.

2005
01:58:00,865 --> 01:58:02,704
But that's all right

2006
01:58:02,785 --> 01:58:06,583
because if you
hang onto the past,
you die a little every day.

2007
01:58:07,465 --> 01:58:08,943
And for myself,

2008
01:58:09,426 --> 01:58:11,184
I know I'd rather live.

2009
01:58:12,426 --> 01:58:13,665
The end.
