1
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,446
When Judy Benjamin was 8, she told her
best friend her life's desire.

2
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,329
''All l want,'' Judy whispered,
''is a big house...

3
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,245
...nice clothes, a maid and a
professional man for a husband. ''

4
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,720
Today, all of Judy's dreams come true.

5
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,282
With this ring be thou consecrated
unto me as my wife.

6
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,038
According to the law of Moses
and faith of lsrael.

7
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,964
According to the law of Moses
and faith of lsrael.

8
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,043
And you, Judy,
say to Yale these words.

9
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,643
Take the ring.

10
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,362
This ring is a symbol
that you are my husband.

11
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,885
This ring is a symbol
that you are my husband.

12
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,200
And a sign of my love and devotion.

13
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,247
And a sign of my love and devotion.

14
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,727
ln the presence of these witnesses...

15
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,165
...you spoke words
and performed the rites...

16
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,446
...which unite your lives.

17
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,079
l therefore declare you,
Yale and Judy...

18
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,480
...husband and wife.

19
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,204
Step on it.

20
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:33,960
Mazel tov !

21
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,602
PRlVATE BENJAMlN

22
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,363
But I only have eyes

23
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,201
For you

24
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,244
Judy Goodman

25
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:31,879
Do you have a date?

26
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,839
No, l told your Uncle Phil
l'd meet him to look at his lease.

27
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,048
- You're not going to work now?
- No, l'm not going to work.

28
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,168
He thinks he's getting evicted.
Let me just talk to him.

29
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,638
Okay?

30
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,208
- Thanks for marrying me.
- You're welcome.

31
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,042
Get me a Perrier with a twist?

32
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,449
- Arnie!
- So you did it, huh?

33
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,085
l can't believe you married Goodman...

34
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,127
...when you could've had me.

35
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,680
l could have lived with you, Arnie.

36
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,722
Big difference.

37
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,359
Judy!

38
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,359
Look who l found!
Mr. Waxman, the upholsterer.

39
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:22,683
l didn't recognize you
without nails in your mouth.

40
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,206
l brought a little something
l think you're going to love.

41
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,807
Mr. Waxman, you finished the ottoman!

42
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,439
Yale will be thrilled.

43
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,043
Wait a minute!
ls this mushroom piping?

44
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,043
Looks beige-y to me, Ma.
This isn't the right color, is it?

45
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,359
Ben...

46
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,407
...what happened to the mushroom?

47
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,086
That's as close as you're going
to get to mushroom in Philadelphia.

48
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,163
Mr. Waxman, we've been
through this a zillion times.

49
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,402
l told you l'm doing Yale's study
in mushroom.

50
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,521
l'm sure you could've found
a yard of mushroom fabric.

51
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,165
You want it, l'll get it.

52
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,640
This is your night!

53
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,958
Wheels?!

54
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,644
Mr. Waxman, l wanted upholstered balls.

55
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,481
Upholstered balls?

56
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,887
- Come on, Peanut.
- Where're we going?

57
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,007
- My feet hurt.
- Your feet will be fine.

58
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,478
l just want to talk to you.

59
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,960
What? Want a divorce already?

60
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,246
Darling, l have a very bad headache.

61
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,483
No wonder, you've danced all night.
l'll get some Tylenol from Mom.

62
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,646
Sweetheart...

63
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,926
...it's not a Tylenol headache.

64
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,488
- Honey!
- Please?

65
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,728
- Honey, not here!
- Please, why not? Come on!

66
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,643
Why? Because everybody
l know is ten feet away.

67
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,962
- They're having a good time. Please?
- No, l'll ruin my dress.

68
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,725
- Your dress is fine. Come on!
- Honey, please? l don't want to.

69
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,122
Kiss me first.

70
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,643
l love you so much.

71
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,209
Hi, Yale.

72
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,608
Judy's always been
a good girl. Always!

73
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,279
She made a mistake
with the first husband.

74
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,443
That's ancient history. The smartest
thing she ever did was to marry you.

75
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,520
That's nice, Teddy.

76
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,000
lt's very important
for a father to know...

77
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,481
...his daughter's going to be
well taken care of. Don't laugh!

78
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,842
You'll know what l mean
when your daughter gets married.

79
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,887
Anyway, that's number one.

80
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,404
Number two!

81
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,362
We'll still have Sunday breakfasts?

82
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,322
- Of course, Daddy.
- Good.

83
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,879
You can get the whitefish
on your way over.

84
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,289
l want to give you two
a little something from mother and me...

85
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,929
...a little extra happiness.

86
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,449
l guess it's not
carpeting for the living room.

87
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,685
That's for the future, not
Lord and Taylor, you little jerk!

88
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,200
Teddy, you're amazing!

89
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,522
lt's my pleasure.
Just use it in good health.

90
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,123
Thanks, Mom.

91
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,446
l'll show my mother,
she'll go crazy!

92
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,848
l can't believe it!

93
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,682
Jude, get me a cigarette.

94
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,404
Coming back inside, Daddy?

95
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,643
l just want to see the recap
of tonight's game.

96
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,162
Should l wait for you here?

97
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,924
Dad?

98
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,047
Get me a match, doll.

99
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,485
Jerry, if you call her you'll
screw it up. That's my job, all right?

100
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,560
No, to call her.

101
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,769
How long you married? Anything more
than 15 years, you lose the house.

102
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,769
lt's not my rule,
that's just the way it is.

103
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,922
Keep the boat, it's a male item.

104
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,925
Prenups is the only way
to get around this and it's too late.

105
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,000
Give her the microwave,
it's a built-in!

106
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,163
lt comes with the house.
What'll you do with one oven?

107
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,446
lt's late now.
6:30 a.m. Monday...

108
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,319
...we'll play racquetball. We'll
figure it out then. Can you wait?

109
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,800
We'll be in Jamaica
6:30 Monday.

110
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,642
l'll be on my honeymoon Monday.

111
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,528
l'll call you from Jamaica.

112
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,442
l don't know, from the hotel.

113
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,129
No, you'll be halved at worst.
You're okay.

114
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,049
Prenups, babe!

115
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,758
- That'll never happen to us.
- l know.

116
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,839
- Did this bathroom turn out gorgeous?
- This ass is gorgeous.

117
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,523
Come here.

118
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,766
- What?
- Wait, honey.

119
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,843
Wait just one second.

120
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,399
- Lift your back leg.
- l don't have a back leg.

121
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:31,121
lt's our wedding night. lt's not
real romantic making love in the sink.

122
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,601
- lt's romantic making love anywhere.
- l know. l love you.

123
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,002
- Let's go into the bedroom.
- We're going into the bedroom next.

124
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,006
Just here. Good, sweetie!

125
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,799
Honey, good!

126
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,120
You're on my hair,
get off my hair.

127
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,365
How's that?

128
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,520
- Oh, honey!
- What?

129
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,481
- Oh, sweetie!
- What?

130
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,639
l'm coming!

131
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,726
Why don't we go and get in bed?

132
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:43,882
Oh, God, full of compassion,
thou who dwellest on high.

133
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,999
Grant perfect rest unto
the soul of Yale Goodman...

134
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,445
...who has departed from this world.

135
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,609
Lord of mercy, bring him
into Thy presence...

136
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,605
...and let his soul be bound up
in the bond of eternal life.

137
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,998
Amen.

138
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,802
l can't try to console you...

139
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,564
...by saying there is
any justice in this world.

140
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,085
Just be thankful for the friendship...

141
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,289
...and tenderness you and Yale
had the opportunity to share.

142
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:19,565
My philosophy of life has gotten me
through some very rough times.

143
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,847
Let me share it with you.

144
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,207
Que ser� ser�.

145
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,205
l got it from the song.

146
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,564
Judith?

147
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,122
Just one thing.

148
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,447
lf you can remember...

149
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,445
...what were Yale's last words?

150
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,887
''l'm coming. ''

151
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,007
l know you don't want to hear this...

152
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,247
...but you got to get
right back into circulation.

153
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,119
When you fall off the horse,
you got to climb right back on.

154
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,645
Aunt Kissy, please!

155
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,404
Could l be alone now?

156
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,489
l'm sorry.

157
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,005
She wants to be alone.

158
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,241
She wants to be alone.

159
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,007
She doesn't want to live in their place.
l can't blame her.

160
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,528
- Sell everything and buy her new.
- Buy her new? She'll live with us.

161
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,166
- What if she doesn't want to?
- She doesn't know what she wants.

162
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,641
And what's she going to do now?
Be my secretary again?

163
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:46,367
The girl's 29 years old
and trained to do nothing.

164
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,442
l'm 28.

165
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,481
Look what we got!

166
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,120
I've never not belonged to somebody.

167
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,405
Never.

168
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,562
My first boyfriend was
in nursery school. I was two...

169
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,607
...and he was three and since then...

170
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,923
...I've been pinned,
lavaliered, engaged...

171
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,281
...married twice.

172
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,800
The first time, l was twenty.

173
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,849
See, l've been in this room
eight days...

174
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,641
...and it's really the first eight days
l've ever been alone in my life.

175
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,089
lf l'm not going to be married...

176
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,720
...l don't know what l'm
supposed to do with myself.

177
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,048
Did you happen to see
that movie Unmarried Woman ?

178
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,287
Well, l didn't get it.

179
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,078
l would've been
Mrs. Alan Bates so fast...

180
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,639
...that guy wouldn't have
known what hit him.

181
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,320
The thing is, and then l'll shut up...

182
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,643
...l haven't done anything wrong.

183
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,882
And l feel like l'm being punished!

184
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,963
l thought l'd be
filling up my freezer...

185
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,726
...and be getting this new
pine sideboard that l ordered and....

186
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,441
Jessica, I do hate...

187
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,648
... to stop your free association,
but our switchboard's flooded.

188
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,680
So set your phone down
and turn your radio up, okay?

189
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,522
Hello, Night Owl,
you're on the air.

190
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,567
You lucked out. I read in
the Enquirer this morning...

191
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,323
... that marriage causes cancer.

192
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,765
Philadelphia Night Owl,
you're on the air.

193
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,161
About that Palestinian homeland.
In your Bible you'll see...

194
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,083
... that the Arabs had first dibs
on the West Bank.

195
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,445
Not tonight, Del, thanks.

196
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,760
Line 4, have you
got advice for Jessica?

197
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,001
Yes, I do. Hi, Jessica.

198
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,245
My name is Jim.

199
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,606
First let me say
how terribly sorry I am...

200
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,846
...about your misfortune.

201
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,799
And nobody knows better than you
that things can 't get much worse.

202
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:35,886
It's also pretty obvious that
you need guidance, security...

203
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,918
...good friends and a healthy dose
of self-confidence, Jessica.

204
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:45,078
What I'm saying is,
I think I can help you find a new life.

205
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,687
- Are you Jessica?
- Jim?

206
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,124
Yeah, hi.

207
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,443
Am l late or you early?

208
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,601
l'm just a few hours early.

209
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,044
Come on.

210
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,125
l should tell you,
my name is really Judy.

211
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,680
l just didn't want anybody l knew
to hear me on the radio.

212
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,239
- Macht nichts.
- What?

213
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,210
lt means,
''lt makes no difference'' in German.

214
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,720
l was stationed over there
for 26 months.

215
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,404
UNlTED STATES ARMY
RECRUlTlNG STATlON

216
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,888
What does that look like to you?

217
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,723
What? Club Med?

218
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,408
lt's the Fort Ord Army
Base in Monterey, California.

219
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,882
Those look like condos.

220
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:53,769
And every soldier gets
his or her own private room.

221
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,518
What are these, yachts?

222
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,488
The Army is the best-kept secret
in the world, Judy.

223
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,563
Looks great, but you don't know me.

224
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,687
l'm not the Army type.

225
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,364
Forget that old brown boot
image of the Army.

226
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,808
lt's the 80s Army, all the ladies love
it. All 89,000 of them.

227
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,485
Check out this list of jobs.

228
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:19,002
There's over 300 jobs, and only
a couple of them not offered to ladies.

229
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,366
Trained killers, stuff like that.

230
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,963
- How much do you earn per month now?
- Now?

231
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:26,840
Nothing.

232
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,318
Nothing?

233
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,804
Thanks.

234
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,763
What are you thinking?

235
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,687
l'm thinking about...

236
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,241
...my family...

237
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,561
...and my house...

238
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,770
...and all the gifts l have to return.

239
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:59,406
You shouldn't be saddled with a lot of
responsibilities and decisions now.

240
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:04,565
l'm prepared to offer you $458 a month,
train you in the job of your choice...

241
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,729
...pay for your food, your housing,
all your medical...

242
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,519
...and give you a 30-day paid vacation.
l'll tell you something...

243
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,647
...with your education and background...

244
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,404
...you could easily land an assignment
in Europe.

245
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,924
Europe?

246
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,038
l do need to get away.

247
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,760
l promise, you'll be in the best
physical shape you've ever been in.

248
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,324
lt will be like 3 years at La Costa.

249
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,127
La Costa. That's good!

250
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,920
What if l hate it once l get there?

251
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,159
Quit.

252
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,440
lt's a job, like anything else.

253
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,520
l....

254
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,039
State your full name.

255
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,481
Do solemnly swear or affirm...

256
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,847
...l will support and defend...

257
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,525
...the Constitution
of the United States...

258
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,204
...from all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

259
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,364
That l will bear true faith
and allegiance...

260
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:12,760
...to the same...

261
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,887
...and will obey the orders...

262
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,605
...of the President
of the United States...

263
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,690
...and the orders of
the officers over me...

264
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,648
...according to regulations.

265
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,558
All right.

266
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,360
My name is Sergeant L.C. Ross.

267
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:44,523
And l'll be your drill sergeant
for your 6 weeks basic training.

268
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,723
My job is to turn you
lovely ladies and gentlemen...

269
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,961
...into United States soldiers.

270
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,886
The first thing we'll do is put you
through your in-processing.

271
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:58,726
While you are waiting in line for your
processing, you will not, l repeat...

272
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,326
...you will not be flapping your lips.

273
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,204
You'll be filling out these forms.

274
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,119
l'm going to call out your names
and l want you to line up behind me.

275
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,560
Abbott.

276
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,879
Barnett.

277
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,524
Benjamin.

278
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:20,799
Benjamin!

279
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,244
- Sir.
- Fall in, Benjamin.

280
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,605
l'm Private Winter...

281
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:27,559
...but l think l can be of assistance
in locating Private Benjamin.

282
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,365
Sir.

283
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,760
- Are we at the fort?
- Yes we are.

284
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,046
Time to wake up now.

285
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,280
ln a sec.

286
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,328
Get your ass up
and out on the company street!

287
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,204
l never!

288
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,566
Give me 10 pushups!
Knock them out!

289
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,846
You mind if l check into
my room first?

290
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,200
Assume the position and hit it!

291
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,565
Now!

292
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,203
Up! Down!

293
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,288
What is this, hell week?

294
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,519
No, Benjamin...

295
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,601
...this is the Army!

296
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,247
Excuse me, sir, is green
the only color these come in?

297
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,882
Close it up back there,
you meatheads. Go!

298
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,480
Pick it up! Pick it up!
Close it up!

299
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,767
Close up that field back there!
Come on, move it!

300
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,360
Where are the yachts?

301
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,882
- Excuse me, are you a reporter?
- Who, me?

302
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,440
No.

303
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,566
l joined up, but l'm not staying.
There's been a mistake.

304
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,801
l'll straighten it out
when the manager gets here.

305
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:12,008
Man on the floor! ln front
of your cots at attention!

306
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,960
Barracks ready for inspection, Captain.

307
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,960
What's the matter, honey?
Are you a crybaby?

308
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,040
No, sir.

309
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,279
Ma'am!

310
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,963
l know how all you ladies
drool over this...

311
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,678
...this Fonzie character...

312
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,284
...but not in my outfit.

313
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,406
Burn it.

314
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:01,639
- Your name, soldier?
- Private Winter, ma'am.

315
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:16,243
Outstanding, Winter. Outstanding.

316
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,005
Ladies!

317
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,047
Examine Private Winter's locker.

318
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,405
Learn from it.

319
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,686
You keep this up and we'll talk
officer's candidate school.

320
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,961
Thank you, ma'am!

321
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,529
This brassiere isn't regulation, Ross.

322
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,567
And neither is this face.

323
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,802
And you look like a clown, soldier.
Clean up your act.

324
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,204
Gianelli's a 308, ma'am.

325
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,444
So it was the Army or jail?

326
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:04,688
After 6 weeks with me,
you're going to wish you chose Attica.

327
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,921
Don't push me, punk.

328
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:11,921
This is the most pathetic group
of trainees l have ever laid my eyes on.

329
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,681
My companies are the best-trained...

330
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,763
...the best-disciplined
soldiers on this base.

331
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,799
l hate to interrupt you,
but could l speak to you for a sec?

332
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:29,440
My Lord! Sergeant,
would you look at this!

333
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,442
l've seen it, ma'am.

334
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,806
What's your name, Princess?

335
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,085
Judy.

336
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,524
Judy Benjamin.

337
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,887
l think they sent me to the wrong...

338
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,923
...place.

339
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:52,207
You see, l did join the Army,
but l joined a different Army.

340
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:56,841
l joined the one with the condos
and the private rooms.

341
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:03,041
No, really! My recruiter,
Jim Ballard, told me that-

342
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:07,078
l don't care what your lousy recruiter
told you, Benjamin.

343
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,400
l'm telling you, there is no other Army.

344
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,404
Wait a minute.

345
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:14,039
l don't want to have to
go to your boss, okay?

346
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:21,081
To be truthful with you, l can't
sleep in a room with 20 strangers.

347
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,365
Oh, dear!

348
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,283
Look at this place.
The Army couldn't afford drapes?

349
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:28,124
l'll be up at the crack of dawn here.

350
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:32,966
And l have to tell you,
l am frankly a little shocked.

351
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,123
You're shocked?

352
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,360
Why?

353
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:39,522
This place is a sty.

354
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:45,247
Look at these stains.
God knows where this has been.

355
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,801
And have you seen the bathroom?

356
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:57,360
Do you think that
the latrine is unsanitary?

357
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,478
lt's disgusting!

358
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:03,039
There are urinals in there.

359
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,685
That's because this is the Army...

360
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,761
...it's not a sorority house.

361
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:16,206
May l see your toothbrush?
Please?

362
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:38,527
Yale, how could you do this to me?

363
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,288
You could eat off that floor.

364
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,202
Why don't you.

365
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,322
Reveille! Let's go!

366
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,162
Everybody up!

367
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,604
Move it!

368
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,040
Everybody up! Everybody move!

369
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,767
Everybody, Benjamin!

370
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,286
You can't mean me.
l worked the night shift.

371
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,879
Go check out the bathroom,
it's fabulous.

372
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,884
Alpha Company...

373
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,768
...attention!

374
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,883
Bravo Company, attention!

375
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,439
At ease, gentlemen...

376
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:09,805
...and ladies.

377
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,202
l'm your post commander.

378
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,483
Colonel Clay Thornbush.

379
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:17,759
Welcome...

380
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:21,087
...to the Biloxi, Mississippi
Basic Training Center.

381
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,127
The backbone of the U.S. Army.

382
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,362
You have two company commanders
to lead you through basic.

383
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,441
Capt. Doreen Lewis,
a 5-year veteran...

384
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,646
...here at Fort Biloxi,
of Alpha Company.

385
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,369
And a newcomer to the family...

386
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,249
...Captain William Wooldridge,
Bravo Company.

387
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,209
Here, we turn out
the best-fed, best-trained...

388
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,680
...soldiers, but it doesn't come easy.

389
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:44,207
lt does not happen overnight.
You must have the strength...

390
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:48,243
...the self-discipline,
and mental stamina necessary...

391
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:51,288
...to meet the standards
of the United States Army.

392
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,521
The next 6 weeks will be the test.

393
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,649
lt'll be hell...

394
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,287
...but you'll be glad you did it.

395
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,568
Move it!

396
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,804
Left, right! Left!

397
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:19,246
l thought it would be
a few leg lifts, a little stretching...

398
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,765
...maybe a disco class, you know.

399
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,604
You're not real talkative,
are you, Soyer?

400
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,525
We run them out...

401
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,368
...and we march them back.

402
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:33,568
Then about twice a week,
l spring a surprise inspection on them.

403
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,402
That's good Army.

404
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,368
Keeps them on their toes.

405
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,519
- Got one more question.
- Shoot.

406
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,000
Are you busy Friday?

407
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,322
Look out, Gianelli!

408
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,887
l can't take anymore.
They've broken me.

409
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,598
- l'm quitting.
- Girl, you can't quit this Army.

410
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,967
l can. The recruiter told me
quit anytime l want.

411
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,804
Jesus, you still believe
your recruiter?

412
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,847
lt's only for 3 years.

413
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:38,206
Company halt!

414
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:44,879
Move it, Benjamin!

415
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:49,009
l don't want to see you stop running
unless you collapse, faint or puke!

416
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:04,086
l have never looked
worse in my life!

417
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,970
Has anybody ever died from basic?

418
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,649
Excuse me.

419
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,726
l think you took my blanket.

420
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,566
This is my blanket.
You gave it to me.

421
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:01,522
- l don't think l did.
- Maybe you just forgot.

422
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,488
Maybe you got brain damage.

423
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,082
Okay, l gave it to you.

424
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,763
By mistake.

425
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,725
- l want it back, okay?
- Take it.

426
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,483
Where are you going?

427
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,404
Home.

428
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:17,398
We're going to have to
do this again real soon.

429
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,561
How about every Friday night?

430
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:25,004
l'm going to set you free, Doreen.

431
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:50,000
Captain Lewis, ma'am,
we've got trouble.

432
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,363
My hair!

433
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,529
Benjamin, you are not fit
to wear that uniform!

434
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,362
No shit!

435
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:15,363
What do you want from me?
l didn't ask her to punish everybody!

436
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:18,204
You think l like schlepping
in rain all day and night?

437
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,486
Just keep marching, Benjamin!

438
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:23,722
My name is Judy! J-U-D-Y...

439
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:26,484
...and l'd like somebody
to call me by my name.

440
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,409
Hey, Judy!

441
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:32,204
l took my life in my own hands.
l made a mistake.

442
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:35,681
l'm sorry. l'll never do it again!
l want to wear my sandals!

443
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,320
l want to go out to lunch.

444
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,367
l want to be normal again.

445
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,403
Would you please
just shut up, Benjamin!

446
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:47,960
God! Never in all my born days
met such a whiny...

447
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:50,087
...candy-ass as you!

448
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:53,481
l don't want to be in the Army!

449
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,123
But we do, okay?

450
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,679
We can't afford any more trouble
on account of you.

451
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,685
l thought you and l
could be friends, but you're....

452
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,603
- Forget it!
- What? l'm what?

453
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,487
You're the most
insensitive person l've ever met.

454
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,721
That is so untrue!

455
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:19,883
l never go to someone's
home empty-handed!

456
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,002
People love me!

457
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,205
Platoon, halt!

458
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,723
Fall out!

459
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,439
To the day room...

460
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,805
...on the double!

461
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,602
They didn't tell me it was you.

462
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,439
Hi, Mom.

463
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,203
Hi, Daddy.

464
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,449
Sit down, Judy.

465
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,404
l was...

466
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:30,847
...going to call, but l wasn't
feeling very good.

467
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,643
Eight days.

468
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,601
Our daughter disappears...

469
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,489
...for eight days without a single word.

470
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:47,323
We thought you were kidnapped.
The FBl was looking for you...

471
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,526
...when some stranger calls...

472
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:53,604
...telling us how fine you are
and that you'd enlisted in the Army.

473
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,767
We tried to figure out why.

474
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:00,762
Personally, l think you've gone
temporarily insane.

475
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,480
That's what we told everyone.

476
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:06,404
We said that you had a collapse...

477
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,606
...and that you were in a mental home.

478
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,448
People think l'm in a mental home?

479
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,519
What should we say?

480
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:17,445
That you're in an Army barracks
in Mississippi with a bunch of....

481
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,965
- What?
- l don't know what!

482
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,362
That's why l don't like it.

483
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,600
How could you do this to your parents?

484
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:33,487
Haven't we done enough for you?
Given you everything you wanted?

485
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:38,042
Did l get you a car on your sixteenth
birthday? Did l get you into college?

486
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:41,646
Did l bail you out of your first
marriage to that schmuck? Did l?

487
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:42,720
Relax.

488
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,688
l am relaxed!

489
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,809
Why are you punishing us?

490
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,327
Maybe you hate us.

491
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,727
l don't hate you,
l love you.

492
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,524
You know your Aunt Kissy
is living with us now.

493
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:09,600
Why?

494
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,524
Because you mother's had a
nervous breakdown, that's why!

495
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:21,528
You were never a smart girl.
We're all going to stop pretending now.

496
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:28,088
You are obviously incapable
of making your own decisions.

497
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:32,285
Starting tomorrow,
l do not let you out of my sight.

498
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,929
l don't care how much you cry.

499
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,321
The Benjamins!

500
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,803
Captain Lewis.

501
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:45,281
lt is so good to meet you in person.

502
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:46,846
Thank you.

503
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:50,640
Captain Lewis said we could
take you home, darling.

504
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:55,323
l'm sorry that things just
didn't work out here for Judy.

505
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,326
She's a hard worker.

506
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,720
She's very...popular...

507
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,165
...with all the other girls.

508
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,199
We are sad to see her go.

509
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:12,564
lf you sign here on the dotted line,
you're as good as home, young lady.

510
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,878
Right there.

511
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,523
Here, darling. Here you are.

512
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:23,365
Come on, take it.

513
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,569
No, thanks.

514
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,562
Think l'll stay.

515
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,000
Mom.

516
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,480
Daddy.

517
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,169
All right, knock it off!

518
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,843
Break it! Let's go!

519
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:16,922
Welcome to the Biloxi War Games,
the Super Bowl of Basic Training.

520
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,008
Simulated combat will test
your skills and courage.

521
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:23,526
Captain Wooldridge will lead
the red team. Captain Lewis...

522
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:27,479
...the blue team. l will be observing
the exercises from the air.

523
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:30,321
Good luck.
And fight proud!

524
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:33,564
Fight proud!

525
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:44,969
Thompson, Hike...

526
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:47,166
...Katz, Byron...

527
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:48,399
...Richter!

528
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:53,089
Your objective is to capture and blow
up Red Team's communication center.

529
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:55,207
Beware, mine-fields are out there.

530
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:57,122
Most of them are inert...

531
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:58,564
...but some are ert.

532
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:00,364
Take off!

533
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:01,679
Private Winter!

534
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,565
You'll serve as Captain Lewis'
aide-de-camp.

535
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,482
Sir. Yes, sir!

536
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:11,360
Team ''C'' !

537
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,767
Gianelli, Glass...

538
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,921
...Moe, Benjamin...

539
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,285
...Soyer!

540
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:21,123
Your objective is to
guard this area here.

541
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:23,725
Excuse me, Drill Sergeant,
what is that area?

542
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,163
That's the swamp.

543
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,680
Swamp?

544
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,603
Take off!

545
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:50,527
lf you can't read that map,
why don't you just say it?

546
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:52,886
You're supposed
to be the point man!

547
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,041
Benj pointed me in the wrong direction!

548
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:58,640
- What am l, Magellan?
- What are we going to guard, algae?

549
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:02,281
Let's just go straight north.

550
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:04,566
- We came from the north!
- Let's go south.

551
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:06,163
Wait! Relax.

552
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,287
lf we can't get back by tomorrow...

553
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,083
...they'll send a search plane.

554
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:12,480
We have enough bodies
to spell ''help''?

555
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:13,880
Let's go.

556
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:23,363
The first time l ever did it...

557
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:34,245
...was on an overnight hike
with my Bible class.

558
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:40,643
We're talking Laemil Lefebvre,
my preacher's son.

559
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:50,488
l'd never done nothing
in my life before. Nothing!

560
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:53,198
And he just climbed right smack-dab...

561
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:56,123
...in the middle of my sleeping bag,
and l was scared.

562
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:01,122
Not to mention the fact
that his daddy, the preacher...

563
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:03,930
...was right over there,
just about ten feet away.

564
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,000
How was it?

565
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,523
Quiet...

566
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:10,928
...but very nice. Very nice!

567
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:16,241
l had an orgasm once.

568
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,808
But l was alone.

569
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:25,968
l guess you must have been alone.

570
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:34,529
Once...

571
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:39,607
....when l was with my first husband,
l got to this place...

572
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:42,723
...that was kind of nice and tingly.

573
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:49,926
l don't know if it was official.

574
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:52,889
l mean, l don't know
if this was an official...

575
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,041
...orgasm, you know.

576
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:01,443
But l counted it as one for five years.

577
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:06,321
How many times
have you been married?

578
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,609
Twice.

579
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,889
The first time for six weeks...

580
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:17,882
...and the second time...

581
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:19,449
...for six hours.

582
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:20,520
Six hours?

583
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:23,445
My husband had a heart attack and died.

584
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:24,600
What?!

585
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,919
My husband had a heart attack...

586
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:32,207
...and died on our wedding night.

587
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:35,766
While we were making love.

588
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:38,369
Holy shit!

589
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:40,487
Jesus, Benjamin!

590
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:43,449
l don't get it. What do you do
after a thing like that?

591
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:49,288
Join the Army.

592
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:14,358
We're lost. We've passed
that same alligator 7 times.

593
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:16,328
l bet the war games are over by now.

594
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:19,607
- Lewis is going to just kill us!
- There's a plane!

595
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:22,318
l bet that's headed back to base.
Let's follow it.

596
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:25,004
l hope it's not Delta to Miami.

597
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:28,644
Look, it's the Red Army headquarters.

598
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:32,679
Quiet!

599
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:39,685
Great.

600
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:43,406
- You owe me $6.95.
- You got it!

601
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:58,519
Hey, blood, how you doing?
All right, looking good!

602
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:01,364
- What's happening, girl?
- What can l tell you?

603
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:04,320
You're my prisoner of war,
that's what's happening!

604
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:08,245
- l ain't your nothing. Get that-
- l mean what l say!

605
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:12,805
Drop it!

606
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:16,846
No, you drop it.

607
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:19,889
l said, drop it!

608
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:25,486
- Where's Captain Wooldridge?
- ln the tent interrogating a P.O.W.

609
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:27,683
Get the keys to the truck.

610
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:29,325
Come on.

611
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:34,208
- Oh, shit!
- Don't worry.

612
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:36,520
- l'll hot-wire it.
- You know how?

613
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:38,523
That's my former career.

614
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:39,839
Excellent!

615
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:57,999
What?

616
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:01,200
Freeze!

617
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:03,841
Private Winter!

618
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:07,369
Well, lookee here!

619
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:11,080
- Look what we got.
- Listen, Captain Lewis....

620
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:14,045
She sent me out to find you guys and...

621
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:16,518
...l got captured.

622
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:20,284
He promised me he'd put in
a good word with Captain Lewis.

623
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:22,122
And l really don't like him.

624
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:24,522
Take the prisoners.

625
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:28,644
Attention all Red Team personnel.

626
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:31,882
The Blue Team has surrendered.
The Red Team has won.

627
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:33,609
So follow us.

628
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:36,606
Attention all Red Team personnel.

629
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:38,523
The Blue Team has surrendered.

630
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:41,204
The Red Team has won, so follow us.

631
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:48,641
Red Team captured!

632
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:51,681
Ross, take the platoon...

633
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:53,879
...head due west.

634
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:58,880
l'll lead the remaining troops
to the east.

635
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:07,684
What now?

636
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:09,239
Got any ideas?

637
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:17,959
Off your asses!
On your feet!

638
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:25,088
Overwhelming enemy forces approaching.

639
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:30,286
Blue Team Company Commander
requests permission to surrender, sir.

640
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,686
Do you accept
surrender of Blue Team?

641
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:36,206
No, sir. We do not, because
we are also the Blue Team, sir.

642
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:37,929
ldentify yourself, soldier!

643
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:40,479
Sir, Private Benjamin, sir!

644
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:54,724
At ease!

645
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:56,801
Which one of you is Private Benjamin?

646
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:58,165
Sir, l am, sir.

647
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:02,086
- Outstanding!
- Thank you, sir!

648
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:05,242
Here's the rest of the squad.
Privates Glass, Gianelli...

649
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:07,720
...Private Moe and Private Soyer, sir.

650
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:10,922
Where is the Red Team Commander?

651
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:43,643
Captain Lewis, you are lucky
to have troopers like this!

652
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:45,244
Congratulations!

653
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:48,648
Next time don't be so quick
to raise the white flag.

654
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:51,679
- Yes, sir.
- The war games are concluded.

655
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:55,047
Troops are dismissed.
l will see you tomorrow at graduation.

656
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:03,765
- Yes, sir!
- Can l offer your team a lift?

657
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:24,008
Meet two of our Thornbirds!
Lieutenant Gomez and Sergeant Gates.

658
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:29,488
Fabulous uniforms!
What's a Thornbird, sir?

659
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:34,121
An elite airborne corp. We recruit
them from the best bases in the country.

660
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:37,369
l'm damn proud of them,
like l'm proud of you girls.

661
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:39,646
lt's a hell of a job you did today!

662
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,369
Where do you hail from?

663
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:45,168
Philadelphia, sir.

664
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:50,324
lt's the seat of our democracy!
Thornie Two is from Philadelphia.

665
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:51,719
Thornie Two, sir?

666
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:53,324
My wife.

667
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:57,167
After 20 years watching us crazy guys
jump out of airplanes...

668
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:00,203
...she decided she wanted to try it.
Remember, Ed?

669
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:03,326
We took her up,
almost had to shove her out!

670
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:05,800
She had a good time,
but she landed wrong.

671
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:09,845
Broke her arm in 3 places. Lucky
we didn't have to shoot her, right?

672
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:12,484
We're approaching, sir.

673
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:15,205
l'll take her down.
You trust me, don't you?

674
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:16,485
Oh, yes, sir!

675
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:19,410
Then let's do it to it!

676
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:24,003
- Tell your men to hang on, Benjamin!
- Hang on, men.

677
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:32,201
Whoop-de-do!

678
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:37,688
lnspection, ladies!

679
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:52,248
Lady Luck!

680
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:59,643
Don't you look at me
with those baby blues.

681
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:04,010
l'm not the great Thornie.

682
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:11,320
You finally succeeded in making
a fool out of me, didn't you?

683
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:14,363
Ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

684
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:18,280
l've got a reward for you,
my little hero.

685
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:23,045
You're all going to scour
every inch of this rat's nest!

686
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:25,602
lnside and out.

687
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:30,607
l mean the bed frames,
the window ledges...

688
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:32,841
...the linoleum...

689
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:36,288
...the toilet seats.

690
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:39,962
You understand me?

691
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:42,401
Ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

692
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:44,449
l can't hear you.

693
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:48,805
l can't hear you!

694
00:55:57,290 --> 00:55:58,439
Thank you.

695
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:05,008
lt breaks my little old heart...

696
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:07,445
...to have to bust up
our winning team...

697
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:10,568
...but l have been assigned
to a new post.

698
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:12,402
A good post!

699
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:16,489
Let's not keep in touch, shall we!

700
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:59,484
Busted up, the whole team.

701
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:01,163
Busted up.

702
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:05,123
l have been assigned to a new post.

703
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:12,965
Come on.

704
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:51,643
Good post!

705
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:23,049
That was nice.

706
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,326
Keep in touch, shall we?

707
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:45,919
At ease!

708
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:51,648
Didn't think you'd make it, did you?

709
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:56,648
You will no longer
be known as trainees.

710
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,325
You have earned the right
to call yourselves...

711
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:04,682
...United States soldiers,
and l'm proud of each of you.

712
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:08,888
On Monday you will receive...

713
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:12,008
...your advanced individual
training assignments.

714
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:13,679
Each of you...

715
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:21,445
...will be given...

716
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:24,484
...a special responsibility
which will play...

717
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:27,688
...a key role in the
defense of the free world.

718
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:30,160
My heartfelt congratulations
and best wishes.

719
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:34,122
l almost forgot.

720
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,718
Dismissed till 0800 Monday morning.
Have a good one!

721
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:07,040
Evening, ladies.

722
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:08,769
We're not interested.

723
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:10,762
Sorry.

724
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,962
All right, l'm uptight, okay?

725
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:17,486
Get yourself a drink,
we're going to cruise.

726
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:48,281
Judy Benjamin, this is Johnny Rourke.

727
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:50,805
And Kim...l forget your last name.

728
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:52,119
Osaka.

729
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:56,089
Come on, sweetheart, let's go.

730
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:01,160
What's happening, Judy?

731
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:04,998
Bourbon, no ice.

732
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,240
l'm with Olivetti of Tokyo.

733
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:11,845
Johnny is my southeastern
U.S. sales manager.

734
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:14,763
He always shows me a hip time.

735
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:20,362
What time is it?

736
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:24,567
l just took your picture, mama!

737
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:28,601
Very hip.

738
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:31,683
Look, l've got to go back to the base.

739
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:34,285
Where's the fire? Come on.

740
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:37,603
This could be a big night for you.

741
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,768
Sincerely.

742
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:44,522
Liz?

743
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:46,363
- How are you?
- God, l'm fine.

744
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:48,805
l can't believe this!

745
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:53,126
Listen, thanks,
but l don't need the loan.

746
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:55,008
What are you doing in New Orleans?

747
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:57,764
My dad's here on a medical
conference and we all came.

748
01:02:58,010 --> 01:02:59,568
Come and see them, they'll die!

749
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:02,199
Wait a minute.
Who is that with your parents?

750
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:07,524
A French gynecologist. He and Dad
spoke on the Lamaze panel together.

751
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:09,926
- lsn't he totally gorgeous?
- Totally.

752
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:12,365
lf it weren't for Jeffrey,
l'd go for him myself.

753
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:14,441
Look who l found!

754
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:18,081
My God, how are you, darling?

755
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:22,039
Kid, you look wonderful!
Please give me a hug.

756
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:27,129
Sit down.

757
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:32,165
- Henri Tremont.
- Benjamin, Judy.

758
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:35,049
Will you you look at this?
Gl Judy!

759
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:37,167
We'll call your parents.

760
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:39,287
They'll be so thrilled we saw you.

761
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:41,919
Your mother's coming along very nicely.

762
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:44,007
She gained back some of the weight.

763
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:46,479
Champagne?

764
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:47,998
l'd love some, thank you.

765
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:49,569
Since Yale's fu....

766
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:54,559
By the way, l can't get over you
in this Army outfit.

767
01:03:54,810 --> 01:03:57,404
She didn't swim because
she didn't want her hair wet.

768
01:03:57,650 --> 01:03:58,799
This is true.

769
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:00,369
What it's like to be a WAC?

770
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:03,118
- l'm not a WAC.
- How often do you talk to your folks?

771
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:06,009
Tell Henri how long
we've known your parents.

772
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:08,804
Shall l make a long story short?

773
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:11,248
Leo and l and Judy's parents...

774
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:15,529
...double-dated in Atlantic City,
before even any one of us was married.

775
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:18,887
lt wasn't Atlantic City.
lt was Asbury Park, but it's all right.

776
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:22,406
l've never been to
Asbury Park in my life.

777
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:26,279
Would you like to dance?

778
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:28,408
l'd love to dance.

779
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:43,322
The Lemishes are terrific people...

780
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:46,960
...but 4 hours of making long stories
short was driving me crazy.

781
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:49,929
4 hours? Try 28 years.

782
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:56,403
l've never danced with a soldier before.

783
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:59,403
l've never danced as a soldier before.

784
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:04,406
- l kind of like it.
- So do l.

785
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:12,040
Do you have a boyfriend in this Army?

786
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:13,484
No.

787
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:17,367
Don't you get lonely?

788
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:21,965
- How'd you get to speak English so well?
- Baltimore.

789
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:25,122
- Maryland?
- l went to med school at Johns Hopkins.

790
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:46,725
l just can't believe
that you're in this Army.

791
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:51,639
lf l knew you better,
l'd show you my dog tags.

792
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:54,405
How much better?

793
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:15,727
Let's go to my room.

794
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:23,045
l'm really attracted to you.

795
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:28,242
But l'm not ready to make love to a
man l just met an hour and a half ago.

796
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:30,728
l'm sorry.

797
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:33,166
That's just the way l am.

798
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:39,287
Usually, by the time l kiss a guy, l
already know his mother's maiden name.

799
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:43,562
l wish l knew you better.

800
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:45,802
l'm thirty-four...

801
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:49,002
...and l live alone in Neuilly,
on the outskirts of Paris.

802
01:06:50,330 --> 01:06:52,719
l'm the only child...

803
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:55,440
...and my father is also a doctor.

804
01:06:56,690 --> 01:06:57,918
What else?

805
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:01,479
When l'm not working l play soccer.

806
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:05,041
Let's see....

807
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:07,683
l'm Jewish.

808
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:33,680
Now l know what l've been
faking all these years.

809
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:44,683
That was your first?

810
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:48,168
And second.

811
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:01,689
Where are you going?

812
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:05,002
- Just to get a sip of champagne.
- l want to go with you.

813
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:20,803
l'm sorry.

814
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:26,078
No l'm not.

815
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:30,643
What?

816
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:33,648
Private Benjamin.

817
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:38,885
Meeting you tonight was....

818
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:44,160
lt was just what l needed.

819
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:55,846
What you needed?

820
01:09:03,730 --> 01:09:05,402
lf you're ever in Paris....

821
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:08,248
lf you're ever in Biloxi.

822
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:14,442
lt was nice meeting you.

823
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:35,519
What did you get?

824
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:39,558
- MP School.
- You can put your violence to good use.

825
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:42,000
- Smoke and flame specialist.
- What's that?

826
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:43,160
A fireman.

827
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:45,878
l got transferred to
Fort Ord, California.

828
01:09:46,130 --> 01:09:48,803
You got the yachts, honey!
You got the yachts!

829
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:51,486
- What?
- OCS.

830
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:53,322
Can you believe it?!

831
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:58,166
- Honey, you're going to be an officer.
- There goes a beautiful friendship.

832
01:09:58,410 --> 01:09:59,286
What did you get?

833
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,765
l don't know. l'm petrified.

834
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:03,563
Excuse me!

835
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:05,761
- Where's Benjamin?
- Right there.

836
01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:07,685
Thornbirds?

837
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:09,804
Me?

838
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:11,882
They don't have women Thornbirds.

839
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:13,483
They do now.

840
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:22,119
I was a skinny fighting lad
No more than seventeen

841
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:26,283
The sorriest excuse for a man
That you have ever seen

842
01:10:26,530 --> 01:10:30,045
But now I am a Thornbird
And as proud as I can be

843
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:34,169
Colonel Thornbush
Made a man out of me

844
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:42,678
Glory, glory
I'll be falling through the sky

845
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:46,639
Glory, glory
I am not afraid to die

846
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:50,200
Glory, glory
I'm as proud as I can be

847
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:54,363
Colonel Thornbush
Made a man out of me

848
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:48,481
Good morning, sir.

849
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:50,243
l'd like you to meet my wife.

850
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:54,805
- Good to meet you, Mrs. Thornbush.
- Good to meet you, Miss Lady Thornbird.

851
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:57,848
- l've heard a lot about you.
- Thank you.

852
01:11:58,170 --> 01:12:00,047
l guess this is the Thorndog.

853
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:01,564
Shake, Scrabble!

854
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:06,880
You must be nervous
about the big jump tomorrow.

855
01:12:07,130 --> 01:12:09,519
The Colonel says l can do it.
l guess l can.

856
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:12,238
The Colonel's motto is,
''Life is a series...

857
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:15,846
...of challenges to be
met and mastered. ''

858
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:20,089
l hope you catch a cloud, Benjamin.
Not a feeling like it in the world.

859
01:12:20,530 --> 01:12:24,079
You're in a veil of white,
not a sound except your beating heart.

860
01:12:24,890 --> 01:12:26,448
lt's godlike.

861
01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:34,448
You must be very special.

862
01:12:34,770 --> 01:12:36,806
The ''Big T'' is a
great judge of character.

863
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:38,847
Stop gabbing and let this soldier...

864
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:40,045
...get some chow.

865
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:41,643
Goodbye, sir.

866
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:47,042
l really appreciate
your confidence in me.

867
01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:49,087
l'm not going to let you down.

868
01:12:50,330 --> 01:12:52,924
See you at 13,000 feet, okay?

869
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:01,881
Oy vey !

870
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:15,201
Go with it!
Soar! You're a Thornbird!

871
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:19,565
Come on, Benjamin,
let's go! All right?

872
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:26,686
- You can do it! Trust me!
- l can't!

873
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:29,926
l'm ashamed, but l'm afraid to die.

874
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:33,321
- l'm afraid, Colonel. l'm not brave.
- Take it easy!

875
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:34,798
l can't. l'm afraid...

876
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:36,802
...my chute won't open.

877
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:39,439
- Calm down, Benjamin!
- What if l fall upside down?

878
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:42,887
- l could vomit in midair!
- Take it easy!

879
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:46,884
l tried to be macho, but those guys
are better at being men than l am!

880
01:13:47,170 --> 01:13:49,081
Relax, Benjamin,
you don't have to jump!

881
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:51,242
- l don't?
- No!

882
01:13:51,490 --> 01:13:53,560
Take it easy, girl! Shape up!

883
01:13:54,290 --> 01:13:55,564
You better?

884
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:57,762
l feel better now.

885
01:13:58,010 --> 01:14:00,524
You don't have to jump.

886
01:14:00,890 --> 01:14:02,801
You're a good man.

887
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:04,648
There are other ways you can serve.

888
01:14:10,890 --> 01:14:11,800
Happy, darling?

889
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:14,481
- You want it!
- What are you doing?

890
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:17,119
l can smell fear in any man
and passion in any woman!

891
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:18,359
You want it!

892
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:22,883
My God, this isn't happening to me!

893
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:25,159
l'm going to take you.

894
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:28,084
l'm not in the mood.
Suddenly l feel nauseous.

895
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:29,922
Come to papa.

896
01:14:30,650 --> 01:14:33,642
l don't think so, sir,
but thanks anyway.

897
01:14:37,330 --> 01:14:39,719
My God! Open, please!

898
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:49,165
At ease.

899
01:14:51,810 --> 01:14:53,641
l'm glad you're back in one piece.

900
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:59,362
l apologize for yesterday's indiscretion.
An unforgivable breach of discipline.

901
01:15:00,050 --> 01:15:01,563
And taste, sir.

902
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:06,765
l hope it hasn't soured you
on the military.

903
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:09,769
The question is how long
you'll continue as a Thornbird.

904
01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:11,887
Hopefully not too long, sir.

905
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:15,079
Understood.

906
01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:19,039
That's why l've put you on special
assignment, transferred to another post.

907
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:22,365
A special assignment
on the ground, l hope.

908
01:15:23,210 --> 01:15:25,087
- A job in procurement.
- Procurement?

909
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:28,288
That's purchasing. l've cut
your orders, you leave at 1500.

910
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:31,399
Greenland?

911
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:33,527
What, penguins? Forget it!

912
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:35,319
Forget it!

913
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:39,362
l was in the first wave of the Rangers
at Normandy on D-day.

914
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:43,922
ln 1952 l was standing with my troops
on the banks of the Yalu River, waiting.

915
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:46,365
MacArthur phoned.
''Come home, Thornie...

916
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:48,885
...it's not our year. ''
l am a good leader.

917
01:15:49,130 --> 01:15:51,041
No, l am a great leader!

918
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:53,765
Your ass is going to
Greenland for a reason.

919
01:15:54,010 --> 01:15:58,526
l won't let you shoot your mouth off,
blemishing my record with innuendo.

920
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:00,522
lnnuendo? Try rape.

921
01:16:03,410 --> 01:16:04,240
How about Guam?

922
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:06,649
My hair will frizz.

923
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:08,760
Okinawa?

924
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:12,082
Malaria? Pass.

925
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:15,005
We have bases all over the world.

926
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:47,444
Dear Glass, hello from Belgium.

927
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:51,239
Sorry it's taken me so long to write,
but I've been very busy.

928
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:53,242
S.H.A.P.E. is an amazing place.

929
01:16:53,530 --> 01:16:56,249
The top military headquarters
in Europe.

930
01:16:56,490 --> 01:16:59,402
Definitely the most exciting duty
a soldier could pull.

931
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:01,925
My M. O. S. is Purchasing Specialist...

932
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:04,889
... the one job I've
trained for all my life.

933
01:17:05,690 --> 01:17:07,362
My superior is a terrific guy...

934
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:10,803
...a Turkish officer
named Lieutenant Rahmi.

935
01:17:11,050 --> 01:17:15,009
But the best one can say of his English
is that it's better than my Turkish.

936
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:17,488
Benyameen, ka'.

937
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:19,839
Sate.

938
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:25,129
Benyameen, l need the inpoormation
on the drying caruses.

939
01:17:25,530 --> 01:17:26,485
Driving courses?

940
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:28,846
Yes, sir. l'm working on that now.

941
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:32,844
Excellent. l want you
to rye-eed it to the counsule.

942
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:35,481
Me? Read it to the council?

943
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:37,886
Do want me to rye-eed it?

944
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:43,486
Private Benyameen...Benjamin!

945
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:46,767
I got a charming apartment
through an ad in Stars and Stripes.

946
01:17:47,010 --> 01:17:50,320
It's right over a bakery,
has a hot plate, running water...

947
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:52,447
...and all the croissants I can eat.

948
01:17:52,690 --> 01:17:55,329
It's not exactly Versailles,
but it's home.

949
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:59,529
For the first time in months, I feel
that things are really going my way.

950
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:17,209
I finally got the nerve
to pay Henri a surprise visit.

951
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:21,159
I'll let you know how it turns out.
I hope he remembers me.

952
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:25,608
My love to Moe and Gianelli.
Votre amie, Private B.

953
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:29,247
Let's see...just got into town.

954
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:34,479
And feeling kind of lonely.
No, don't say lonely.

955
01:18:34,730 --> 01:18:35,879
Oh, God!

956
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:04,879
lt's a great house, but don't be
impressed. lt's a hand-me-down.

957
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:24,808
- Morning.
- Nine o'clock?

958
01:19:25,050 --> 01:19:27,723
l haven't slept this late in 3 months.

959
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:35,200
- Where are you going?
- Sunday soccer.

960
01:19:36,450 --> 01:19:37,769
Merde! l'm late.

961
01:19:38,050 --> 01:19:39,847
l have to go anyway.

962
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:41,768
Don't be ridiculous, please!

963
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:45,207
Stay. l want you to be here when
l get back at three o'clock.

964
01:19:45,450 --> 01:19:49,728
l'm going to make love to you,
and l'll take you to my favorite bistro.

965
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:53,050
And we'll listen to
some nice ltalian jazz.

966
01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:55,246
Max!

967
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:07,241
Hello, baby!

968
01:20:09,490 --> 01:20:11,082
He's beautiful.

969
01:20:11,330 --> 01:20:12,319
Sit!

970
01:20:17,090 --> 01:20:18,728
The dog is deaf.

971
01:20:25,050 --> 01:20:27,245
Wait for me, please.

972
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:34,046
l could get used to you.

973
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:58,563
l paid 8,000 francs for this rug.

974
01:20:59,570 --> 01:21:03,768
l'm sorry. He gets nervous
around new people.

975
01:21:04,010 --> 01:21:05,762
He's not the only one.

976
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:12,968
- l have to clean this up.
- You go play. l'll clean up.

977
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:15,599
No, l'll clean it.
Go play.

978
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:28,478
l adore you.

979
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:40,241
There are two bids we recommend:
Sergio Devoto's Driving Academy...

980
01:21:40,570 --> 01:21:43,164
...which teaches evasive driving
to the chauffeurs...

981
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:46,607
...of such dignitaries as
General Alexander Haig...

982
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:50,399
...President Giscard d'Estaing,
Mick Jagger-

983
01:21:50,690 --> 01:21:52,920
Excuse me, Private Benjamin...

984
01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:56,162
...l'm afraid l missed
the security data on these drivers.

985
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:58,878
The security data was
unavailable to me, sir.

986
01:21:59,530 --> 01:22:01,885
Who's here from security?

987
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:04,480
l am, sir.

988
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:10,690
That material is highly classified, sir.

989
01:22:10,930 --> 01:22:14,240
l am certain this soldier
is not cleared for that level.

990
01:22:14,490 --> 01:22:16,481
Then clear her, Captain.

991
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:19,000
ls there a problem?

992
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:22,926
No, sir.

993
01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:26,207
Then we'll expect a revised report
by the next council session.

994
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:27,439
Gentlemen...

995
01:22:27,770 --> 01:22:28,759
...chow time.

996
01:22:33,050 --> 01:22:34,039
Good job.

997
01:22:53,090 --> 01:22:54,808
Behave yourself, Judy Benjamin...

998
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:59,521
...or l'll drum your ass out of S.H.A.P.E.
so fast it'll make your head spin.

999
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:08,288
Sorry, Helga.

1000
01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:10,401
Who is your friend, Doreen?

1001
01:23:10,650 --> 01:23:12,880
She's no fwiend...friend.

1002
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:15,766
Listen, the bags are packed.

1003
01:23:20,850 --> 01:23:22,886
My ex-girlfriend, Claire, painted it.

1004
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:26,759
- What's it supposed to be, death?
- No, it's a self-portrait.

1005
01:23:27,610 --> 01:23:29,601
How long ago did you and this...

1006
01:23:30,450 --> 01:23:32,168
...painter break up?

1007
01:23:32,930 --> 01:23:37,003
-14 weeks ago, Monday.
- You're still counting it in weeks?

1008
01:23:38,770 --> 01:23:42,524
How come you broke up?
Or is that too personal?

1009
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:45,728
Claire is a brilliant woman.

1010
01:23:45,970 --> 01:23:50,122
l even joined the Communist Party
for her for a week.

1011
01:23:50,770 --> 01:23:54,399
Not romantic though,
much too independent.

1012
01:23:58,090 --> 01:24:00,206
Do you know a lot of tortured artists?

1013
01:24:00,770 --> 01:24:02,965
Only tortured lawyers.

1014
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:06,560
Your first husband was a lawyer?

1015
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:10,086
No, Rick was a tennis pro
at the El San Juan.

1016
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:14,245
My therapist said that l had
a neurotic need to find a father figure.

1017
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:18,244
And he had a neurotic need to find
a father-in-law who had a lot of money.

1018
01:24:27,490 --> 01:24:32,166
You know, l've been married to men
l haven't felt this comfortable with.

1019
01:25:42,850 --> 01:25:46,240
What's the story with you
and this Tremont character?

1020
01:25:47,090 --> 01:25:48,808
Why are you spying on me?

1021
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:05,125
- Your lover-boy's a Red!
- Don't be ridiculous!

1022
01:26:05,370 --> 01:26:08,203
He was a Red for about five seconds.

1023
01:26:08,450 --> 01:26:10,247
Because of a woman he used to date.

1024
01:26:10,690 --> 01:26:14,569
Nobody stops being a Communist.
lt's a terminal disease.

1025
01:26:14,810 --> 01:26:18,439
And l am not going to sit around
with my thumb up my ass...

1026
01:26:18,690 --> 01:26:21,079
...while you divulge
classified information...

1027
01:26:21,330 --> 01:26:23,480
...during the throes of passion.

1028
01:26:23,730 --> 01:26:26,847
Please! l can barely speak
during the throes of passion.

1029
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:30,447
Believe me, Henri Tremont is
as much a Communist as me.

1030
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:31,879
Or you!

1031
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:36,561
lf Patton were alive,
he would slap your face.

1032
01:26:39,810 --> 01:26:41,004
As you were.

1033
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:46,729
Captain Lewis.

1034
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:52,285
Private Benjamin has made herself
vulnerable to a Red, sir.

1035
01:26:52,530 --> 01:26:53,679
l read the report.

1036
01:26:53,930 --> 01:26:54,885
lt's not true, sir.

1037
01:26:55,130 --> 01:26:59,408
We're not blind to the fact
that half of Europe is Communistic.

1038
01:27:00,530 --> 01:27:02,760
But here at S.H.A.P.E.
they're still the enemy.

1039
01:27:03,450 --> 01:27:05,008
General Foley, Henri Tremont...

1040
01:27:05,250 --> 01:27:08,526
...is not a Communist.
He's a gynecologist.

1041
01:27:09,530 --> 01:27:11,760
Captain Lewis is hung up
on a technicality.

1042
01:27:12,090 --> 01:27:16,208
l'm sorry, but it's against regulations
for you to associate with this man.

1043
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:19,445
You're up for a promotion.

1044
01:27:19,690 --> 01:27:22,841
l'd hate to see this incident
jeopardize your career.

1045
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:25,966
What are you trying to tell me, sir?

1046
01:27:27,530 --> 01:27:29,168
lt's either him...

1047
01:27:29,450 --> 01:27:30,439
...or us.

1048
01:27:54,730 --> 01:27:56,766
- Can't you hear?
- Can't you move?

1049
01:28:03,010 --> 01:28:04,409
lt's Judy.

1050
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:05,605
Judy who?

1051
01:28:06,450 --> 01:28:08,680
Darling, how are you?

1052
01:28:09,970 --> 01:28:10,800
What?

1053
01:28:17,090 --> 01:28:18,648
She's getting married.

1054
01:28:34,170 --> 01:28:37,321
Monsieur Shiffman!
Thank God!

1055
01:28:42,570 --> 01:28:45,038
Listen, the tablecloths...

1056
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:53,129
...they're terrible.
The color, la couleur, is all wrong.

1057
01:28:56,410 --> 01:28:59,482
The wedding is in yellow...

1058
01:29:00,050 --> 01:29:02,245
...and butterscotch.

1059
01:29:03,330 --> 01:29:06,163
And right now l'm looking at
something entre...

1060
01:29:06,410 --> 01:29:09,004
...canari et banane.

1061
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:10,286
Gabby!

1062
01:29:12,610 --> 01:29:13,759
Pardon, Madame!

1063
01:29:14,810 --> 01:29:17,244
l get the Hoover.

1064
01:29:22,210 --> 01:29:24,804
Was she a good maid
before she met me?

1065
01:29:26,770 --> 01:29:29,682
ls it smart to fire the maid
just before the wedding?

1066
01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:32,166
Especially with your parents coming.

1067
01:29:32,530 --> 01:29:35,886
Okay, she stays until after the wedding.

1068
01:29:38,170 --> 01:29:40,126
You look very beautiful today.

1069
01:29:41,170 --> 01:29:42,489
So do you.

1070
01:29:43,210 --> 01:29:45,360
What did your friends say
when they called?

1071
01:29:45,610 --> 01:29:48,329
They're coming over on
Army Transport next week.

1072
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:51,368
l can't wait to see them.
lt's going to be so much fun.

1073
01:29:51,610 --> 01:29:53,885
And Glass is learning French!

1074
01:30:02,770 --> 01:30:04,601
Honey, who was that?

1075
01:30:06,210 --> 01:30:08,041
lt was Claire.

1076
01:30:11,610 --> 01:30:12,838
Claire?

1077
01:30:25,010 --> 01:30:27,046
Get over this obsession with Claire.

1078
01:30:27,370 --> 01:30:29,406
You stood with your tongue hanging out.

1079
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:31,448
l was surprised to see her.

1080
01:30:31,690 --> 01:30:34,762
Surprised?
l'd call it catatonic.

1081
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:38,605
You don't see me getting hung up on your
old boyfriends and husbands.

1082
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:40,203
Do you?

1083
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:43,369
Listen to me.

1084
01:30:43,650 --> 01:30:44,685
Come here.

1085
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:47,766
l love you.

1086
01:30:48,370 --> 01:30:50,361
We're getting married in a week.

1087
01:30:57,850 --> 01:30:59,442
l want to have a baby with you.

1088
01:31:02,090 --> 01:31:03,159
You do?

1089
01:31:04,810 --> 01:31:06,482
Oh, honey!

1090
01:31:07,690 --> 01:31:09,248
l'd love to have a baby.

1091
01:31:10,690 --> 01:31:12,328
l thought l was getting too old.

1092
01:31:16,330 --> 01:31:17,968
A baby!

1093
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:24,128
- l want us to be together always.
- We will!

1094
01:31:30,410 --> 01:31:32,366
lt's the reality of things sometimes...

1095
01:31:32,610 --> 01:31:36,319
...they don't always work out
exactly as they are planned, so....

1096
01:31:37,570 --> 01:31:39,083
What are you saying?

1097
01:31:41,890 --> 01:31:43,960
- l want you to sign this.
- What is it?

1098
01:31:44,210 --> 01:31:46,087
Contrat de mariage.

1099
01:31:47,050 --> 01:31:49,689
A letter of financial agreement.

1100
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:54,608
God forbid something should happen
to us. lt just helps us stay friends.

1101
01:31:56,290 --> 01:31:58,645
l want to be your wife, not your friend.

1102
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:02,718
lt's fair. l allocated for myself
what was mine before our marriage.

1103
01:32:03,290 --> 01:32:05,360
You cannot expect me to give you...

1104
01:32:05,610 --> 01:32:09,444
...half of a house that's been
in my family for centuries.

1105
01:32:13,170 --> 01:32:16,446
We don't need this kind of thing
between us. We'll make it.

1106
01:32:17,370 --> 01:32:19,247
l can't get married without it.

1107
01:32:28,890 --> 01:32:30,721
lt's in French.

1108
01:32:30,970 --> 01:32:32,369
Please.

1109
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:52,320
Private Benjamin?

1110
01:32:52,570 --> 01:32:54,925
Did l write that? l'm sorry.

1111
01:32:55,170 --> 01:32:56,762
l'll just cross it out.

1112
01:33:01,810 --> 01:33:03,448
lnitial it.

1113
01:33:17,170 --> 01:33:19,525
Where shall we go tonight?
Regine's?

1114
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:37,720
Took Henri's car to the shop.
Made Henri's hair appointment.

1115
01:33:37,970 --> 01:33:39,767
Took Max to the vet.

1116
01:33:40,010 --> 01:33:42,365
Picked up Henri's soccer uniform.

1117
01:33:48,890 --> 01:33:52,121
You've got to remember that
l used to be a very active person.

1118
01:33:52,370 --> 01:33:54,520
l was jumping out of airplanes...

1119
01:33:54,770 --> 01:33:57,728
...and at S.H.A.P.E. it was
like nonstop chaos.

1120
01:33:57,970 --> 01:34:00,245
You're not thinking about
opening a store?

1121
01:34:00,490 --> 01:34:02,321
No, you were right about that.

1122
01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:05,960
lt would've been too much
of a hassle to do. lt was a bad idea.

1123
01:34:06,210 --> 01:34:09,759
But there have to be other choices.

1124
01:34:10,010 --> 01:34:12,319
Do you know what l did today?

1125
01:34:13,490 --> 01:34:15,481
l rearranged my closet.

1126
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:17,083
For three hours.

1127
01:34:17,330 --> 01:34:20,481
There's definitely something wrong
with that, isn't there?

1128
01:34:22,450 --> 01:34:24,805
- Am l making sense?
- No.

1129
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:27,442
And that's what l love about you.

1130
01:34:30,650 --> 01:34:33,005
This is the color of hair
l was talking about.

1131
01:34:34,610 --> 01:34:36,601
l don't know. Maybe.

1132
01:34:38,570 --> 01:34:39,889
l love it.

1133
01:35:06,570 --> 01:35:08,606
Rita Hayworth, l swear to God!

1134
01:35:08,850 --> 01:35:11,762
- l wouldn't have recognized you.
- You look stunning!

1135
01:35:12,010 --> 01:35:15,286
Turn around, let me see the outfit.
Oh God, doll! Gorgeous!

1136
01:35:15,530 --> 01:35:16,963
lt's an absolute vision.

1137
01:35:17,210 --> 01:35:19,246
Her hair is the worst!

1138
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:23,529
To see you looking like your
old self again, you have no idea!

1139
01:35:23,770 --> 01:35:25,567
Who knows what we'd do
in her place.

1140
01:35:26,650 --> 01:35:29,403
The important thing is,
Judy's Judy again.

1141
01:35:29,650 --> 01:35:34,041
- Truthfully, you don't miss the Army?
- What's to miss? $400 a month?

1142
01:35:34,290 --> 01:35:37,168
The only good thing about it
was that what's-her-name.

1143
01:35:37,410 --> 01:35:38,729
Captain Lewis?

1144
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:42,441
l hope her coat's good enough.
l had no idea it'd be so chilly.

1145
01:35:42,690 --> 01:35:47,320
- lt's November here, Kissy.
- lt's November everywhere, genius!

1146
01:35:55,850 --> 01:35:56,999
Sit!

1147
01:35:58,570 --> 01:36:00,720
l was talking to Max.

1148
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:05,121
lt's good to see you up.

1149
01:36:06,370 --> 01:36:08,486
Excuse me for interrupting.

1150
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:11,122
Does this belong to anyone?

1151
01:36:11,370 --> 01:36:14,009
Because l'm positive it isn't mine.

1152
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:16,002
Oui, Madame.
Where did you find it?

1153
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:17,763
Where you left eet!

1154
01:36:18,090 --> 01:36:20,809
May l ask what you were doing
in my bed?!

1155
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:23,644
l was not in your bed, madame.
l make your bed.

1156
01:36:25,170 --> 01:36:26,649
lt must have fallen.

1157
01:36:27,730 --> 01:36:28,640
What are you doing?

1158
01:36:28,890 --> 01:36:31,688
l would like to know how
this item got into my bed.

1159
01:36:35,970 --> 01:36:39,485
This is too much!
Judy, give Gabrielle back the cross.

1160
01:36:46,330 --> 01:36:48,719
What should l think?
She's the world's worst maid!

1161
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:50,562
Enough! Please!

1162
01:36:54,130 --> 01:36:58,362
What's gotten into you lately? lt's like
l live with the kid from the Exorcist !

1163
01:36:59,530 --> 01:37:01,885
Two weeks ago l was like a god to you!

1164
01:37:02,170 --> 01:37:03,728
Now you show me no respect.

1165
01:37:04,410 --> 01:37:05,889
l respect you.

1166
01:37:06,210 --> 01:37:10,522
Accusing me of sleeping with Gabrielle!
You think l'm so low l'd seduce a child?

1167
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:14,160
Do you?

1168
01:37:19,210 --> 01:37:21,360
Honey, l'm nervous.

1169
01:37:22,090 --> 01:37:24,160
l'm very nervous.

1170
01:37:24,410 --> 01:37:28,483
And l know that once we get married
everything is going to be fine.

1171
01:37:28,730 --> 01:37:30,322
l'm sorry.

1172
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:42,845
l fly 6,000 miles to attend
my daughter's wedding...

1173
01:37:43,090 --> 01:37:44,887
...and the groom is playing soccer!

1174
01:37:45,130 --> 01:37:48,247
Daddy, he'll be here any minute.
He probably went into overtime.

1175
01:37:48,570 --> 01:37:50,720
Monsieur, my son is very reliable.

1176
01:37:50,970 --> 01:37:53,723
- He will be here shortly.
- lt just isn't right!

1177
01:37:58,770 --> 01:38:00,249
Jean-Paul!

1178
01:38:05,010 --> 01:38:06,409
Where is Henri?

1179
01:38:07,050 --> 01:38:09,883
The bum never showed up
for the game. lsn't he here?

1180
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:12,079
No.

1181
01:38:12,410 --> 01:38:13,445
He never showed up?

1182
01:38:16,770 --> 01:38:20,001
Judy, don't hate me
for saying this or nothing...

1183
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:24,402
...but you really might be better-off.

1184
01:38:24,650 --> 01:38:26,481
Don't be ridiculous!

1185
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:32,641
l don't know how to say this, but you
were starting to act a bit weird again.

1186
01:38:32,890 --> 01:38:34,960
What am l going to do?
l'm a wreck.

1187
01:38:35,690 --> 01:38:37,009
He's back!

1188
01:38:41,690 --> 01:38:43,203
You look perfect.

1189
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:45,008
- Where were you?
- l'm fine.

1190
01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:47,923
No, where were you?
l was so scared.

1191
01:38:48,170 --> 01:38:51,367
- You don't want to know this.
- l do want to know.

1192
01:38:53,890 --> 01:38:55,687
l had to see Claire.

1193
01:38:58,330 --> 01:38:59,285
You were with Claire?

1194
01:38:59,530 --> 01:39:03,125
She is in so much trouble.
You've no idea what l've been through.

1195
01:39:03,370 --> 01:39:07,124
There are 75 people waiting for you.
Couldn't you have phoned?

1196
01:39:07,370 --> 01:39:10,840
- Don't bad French artists have phones?
- She was overwrought.

1197
01:39:11,170 --> 01:39:15,049
Her boyfriend beat her up.
l prescribed a sedative for her to sleep.

1198
01:39:15,290 --> 01:39:17,724
That takes 2 minutes,
you were gone 4 hours.

1199
01:39:17,970 --> 01:39:20,484
The place was a mess.
l hung up clothes and did dishes.

1200
01:39:20,730 --> 01:39:22,846
You did Claire's dishes?

1201
01:39:24,650 --> 01:39:27,323
Shall l stop being nice to people
because we're marrying?

1202
01:39:27,850 --> 01:39:31,001
l just don't understand
how you could be with Claire...

1203
01:39:31,450 --> 01:39:32,280
...today.

1204
01:39:32,530 --> 01:39:34,998
You want to walk down the aisle
with me or not?

1205
01:41:09,290 --> 01:41:11,599
Not so fast.

1206
01:41:13,810 --> 01:41:17,564
l know this is a very
awkward time to do this...

1207
01:41:18,730 --> 01:41:20,004
...but l want to break up.

1208
01:41:20,290 --> 01:41:21,962
She's crazy again.

1209
01:41:22,690 --> 01:41:23,839
Listen to me.

1210
01:41:24,130 --> 01:41:28,646
You're having an anxiety attack.
l'll give you a shot to calm down.

1211
01:41:28,890 --> 01:41:31,882
No, l want to be perfectly conscious
when l call a cab.

1212
01:41:32,130 --> 01:41:35,520
What are you doing to me?
What is this about? Gabrielle?

1213
01:41:36,210 --> 01:41:38,804
l slept with her one night
when you were acting crazy.

1214
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:42,445
We'll fire her after the wedding.

1215
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:47,203
You're such a schmuck!

1216
01:41:49,490 --> 01:41:50,320
Daddy...

1217
01:41:50,570 --> 01:41:52,720
...Mom just fainted.

1218
01:41:54,090 --> 01:41:55,409
Schmuck?!

1219
01:41:56,490 --> 01:41:58,845
When l met you,
you were in the Army.

1220
01:41:59,210 --> 01:42:01,519
You were nothing,
picking up strangers in bars!

1221
01:42:01,770 --> 01:42:03,840
- Now just a minute!
- She was.

1222
01:42:04,330 --> 01:42:07,800
l'll give you a future, a home, a name.
For once don't be stupid!

1223
01:42:09,130 --> 01:42:10,483
- There's Claire.
- Where?

1224
01:42:17,290 --> 01:42:18,325
Don't call me stupid.

1225
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:27,241
