1
00:02:09,432 --> 00:02:10,865
Hung Hsi-Kwan!

2
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:14,380
We control the whole Monastery now.

3
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:15,871
Hung, where do you think you're going?

4
00:04:09,512 --> 00:04:10,467
Hsiang Chao-Hui.

5
00:04:11,632 --> 00:04:12,587
Here, sir.

6
00:04:14,992 --> 00:04:16,584
I am at your disposal, My Lord.

7
00:04:16,832 --> 00:04:19,266
How many times do I have to tell you?

8
00:04:19,432 --> 00:04:21,787
Don't you address me as "Lord",
when I'm not in uniform.

9
00:04:22,152 --> 00:04:23,107
Yes, sir!

10
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:27,385
We burned the Shaolin Monastery.
All those who were inside are burnt.

11
00:04:27,552 --> 00:04:30,350
Even those who managed to escape...
have been killed.

12
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:31,945
But we couldn't find Hung Hsi-Kwan.

13
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:34,751
There are bodies
scattered all over the place.

14
00:04:34,912 --> 00:04:36,743
I think Hung must have been killed too.

15
00:04:36,912 --> 00:04:38,106
What if he escaped?!

16
00:04:38,872 --> 00:04:40,749
We caught two men.

17
00:05:00,112 --> 00:05:01,545
Where is Hung Hsi-kwan?

18
00:05:01,712 --> 00:05:02,622
I don't know.

19
00:05:13,392 --> 00:05:15,383
You saw it, are you going to tell me?

20
00:05:15,552 --> 00:05:16,302
I'll tell you.

21
00:05:17,312 --> 00:05:18,950
You'd better!

22
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:21,865
Hung Hsi-Kwan escaped
to lead the patriots

23
00:05:22,032 --> 00:05:23,226
and kill all Manchu.

24
00:05:28,832 --> 00:05:33,144
General, all the monastery men are
Shaolin disciples

25
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:36,509
and Chinese patriots.

26
00:05:36,672 --> 00:05:39,789
You can't force them to talk.

27
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:45,749
Mai Hsin, which side are you on anyway?

28
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:49,268
I'm only stating the facts here.

29
00:05:55,072 --> 00:05:57,666
What a pity! I don't have the chance to

30
00:05:57,832 --> 00:06:01,302
fight with those
Shaolin Kung Fu experts,

31
00:06:01,472 --> 00:06:03,702
to have a fair contest.

32
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:06,832
General Che, you are our leader,

33
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,347
this is a war, not a test of trifle skills!

34
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:12,424
You have no idea!
Gen. Che's Kung Fu is the best in Manchuria.

35
00:06:12,592 --> 00:06:15,584
He learn it from the living Buddha Lama.

36
00:06:16,432 --> 00:06:18,662
I don't think any Chinese can match him.

37
00:06:19,032 --> 00:06:19,987
Yes, yes!

38
00:06:20,912 --> 00:06:25,030
I want to meet Chinese Kung Fu men.

39
00:06:25,192 --> 00:06:29,185
Hope I can meet Hung Hsi-Kwan some day.

40
00:06:35,072 --> 00:06:38,667
We should be promoted
for burning Shaolin temple.

41
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,504
Rubbish, we'd better look for Hung Hsi-Kwan,

42
00:06:40,712 --> 00:06:42,623
otherwise we'll be punished.

43
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:43,542
Yes.

44
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:03,747
Hung Hsi-kwan!

45
00:07:55,632 --> 00:07:57,429
Hung could've gone to south-west,

46
00:07:57,592 --> 00:07:59,071
probably heading for Kwangtung.

47
00:08:10,112 --> 00:08:13,024
My Lord, Hung's kung fu is too good,

48
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,147
l...

49
00:08:14,472 --> 00:08:18,260
You are still alive!
That means you didn't try your best.

50
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:22,384
My Lord, please allow me to make up for it.

51
00:08:30,272 --> 00:08:33,469
This is an example for not fighting hard.

52
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:41,827
Stop!

53
00:09:43,152 --> 00:09:45,905
- What's the matter?
- I said stop and do as I told you.

54
00:09:46,072 --> 00:09:48,540
Ridiculous! This road is not yours!
Hold your tongue.

55
00:09:56,072 --> 00:10:00,190
His Lordship is looking for Shaolin men.

56
00:10:32,712 --> 00:10:35,624
<i>Break out wood man lane.</i>

57
00:10:36,432 --> 00:10:39,071
<i>Beat down plum blossom trap.</i>

58
00:10:41,672 --> 00:10:43,742
<i>Who is the Shaolin hero?</i>

59
00:10:43,912 --> 00:10:47,109
<i>There he is.</i>

60
00:10:55,952 --> 00:10:57,067
Stop!

61
00:11:02,632 --> 00:11:04,907
I said stop, do you hear me?

62
00:11:28,552 --> 00:11:30,907
Friend, what's your name?

63
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:32,947
Fang Shih-Yu.

64
00:12:46,912 --> 00:12:48,425
What happened to you two?

65
00:12:48,592 --> 00:12:50,981
We were walking along the road

66
00:12:51,152 --> 00:12:53,620
when a man attacked us. Then...

67
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:59,063
That was bad luck,
being beat up without any reason.

68
00:12:59,232 --> 00:13:01,143
Two guys jumped me back there.

69
00:13:01,312 --> 00:13:04,145
I took them to be robbers,
so I beat them up.

70
00:13:06,032 --> 00:13:09,627
The one who attacked us
was like an animal.

71
00:13:11,952 --> 00:13:13,624
No wonder you look like you've been mauled.

72
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:21,709
Can you walk?

73
00:13:21,872 --> 00:13:24,022
Shall I send in a wagon from town?

74
00:13:24,192 --> 00:13:25,671
No.

75
00:13:25,832 --> 00:13:27,902
May we know your good name please?

76
00:13:28,072 --> 00:13:29,630
Fang Shih-Yu.

77
00:13:30,992 --> 00:13:33,301
The hero Fang!

78
00:13:33,472 --> 00:13:36,544
You must be careful!
The robber is a cruel devil.

79
00:13:36,712 --> 00:13:40,387
He shows no mercy.

80
00:13:40,552 --> 00:13:41,621
You better leave.

81
00:13:41,912 --> 00:13:44,142
I will teach him a lesson.

82
00:13:44,312 --> 00:13:46,780
It'll be his bad luck if he meets me.

83
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,544
Are you from the authorities?

84
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:51,431
No, we are hired escorts.

85
00:13:51,592 --> 00:13:55,187
This robber put us in a tough spot.

86
00:13:55,352 --> 00:13:57,422
You'd better watch out. Hung is his name.

87
00:13:57,592 --> 00:13:59,628
It's he who should worry, not me.

88
00:14:28,112 --> 00:14:30,672
Shaolin man, you think you can escape?

89
00:15:23,872 --> 00:15:24,987
You are...

90
00:15:25,152 --> 00:15:27,746
We're looking for a guy named Hung.

91
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,868
We're looking for a robber named Hung too!

92
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:37,345
Hero Fang, we are escorts. Hung robbed us.

93
00:15:37,512 --> 00:15:39,343
We were injured

94
00:15:39,512 --> 00:15:43,027
and some of us were killed.

95
00:15:43,712 --> 00:15:45,782
Hung is real mean.

96
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:48,227
I must get him.

97
00:15:50,912 --> 00:15:53,984
Hero Fang, Hung is dressed in black...

98
00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:57,144
and has a fierce-looking appearance.

99
00:15:57,312 --> 00:15:58,665
He has wounds on his body and one leg.

100
00:15:59,232 --> 00:16:00,745
Alright.

101
00:16:10,672 --> 00:16:13,630
Excuse me, have you seen
a man dressed in black,

102
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:17,341
he is wounded and looks fierce?

103
00:16:17,512 --> 00:16:18,911
- No.
- Sorry.

104
00:16:20,192 --> 00:16:22,183
Excuse me, have you seen...

105
00:16:22,352 --> 00:16:24,786
What's the name of the man you want?

106
00:16:24,952 --> 00:16:26,670
I only know Hung is his last name.

107
00:16:28,392 --> 00:16:29,825
What do you want him for?

108
00:16:29,992 --> 00:16:32,984
He's mean. I wish to teach him a lesson.

109
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,945
You talk like you are a Kung Fu expert.

110
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:45,669
You sure know good Kung Fu!

111
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:47,507
Good... fast and neat-handed.

112
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:49,424
May I know your name?

113
00:16:50,512 --> 00:16:51,467
Fang Shih-Yu.

114
00:16:52,272 --> 00:16:53,307
Hold it!

115
00:16:55,392 --> 00:16:58,350
It's an honor for me to know such a hero.

116
00:16:58,632 --> 00:17:01,465
Manchu burned the Shaolin Monastery,

117
00:17:01,632 --> 00:17:04,385
you mustn't reveal your name in public.

118
00:17:04,552 --> 00:17:05,507
I'm not afraid.

119
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:08,745
If I meet the Manchu, I'll teach them
a real good lesson.

120
00:17:10,592 --> 00:17:13,470
May I have the honor of a drink with you?

121
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,187
My pleasure, let's go! Please!

122
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:17,307
Please.

123
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:24,028
Please sit...

124
00:17:48,832 --> 00:17:50,311
Brother Hung.

125
00:17:51,952 --> 00:17:53,067
You are...

126
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:55,831
I am Nien Shui-Ching.

127
00:17:56,352 --> 00:17:58,741
Are you the son of Gen. Nien Ken-Yao?

128
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,267
The kid who joined
the Shaolin Monastery,

129
00:18:01,432 --> 00:18:03,866
- after the Manchu killed the general?
- Yes.

130
00:18:05,312 --> 00:18:08,384
My! You're quite a grownup now.

131
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:10,384
Over there.

132
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:18,101
I'm Hung His-Kwan.

133
00:18:53,472 --> 00:18:56,145
Hero Hung, you are a great man. You...

134
00:18:56,592 --> 00:18:59,106
You are Manchurian's jackal.

135
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:01,422
Don't even think that I'll spare you.

136
00:19:09,992 --> 00:19:12,381
Who else escaped from the Monastery?

137
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:17,227
I've been on the run
for more than ten days,

138
00:19:17,392 --> 00:19:19,747
nearly met Manchurian everyday.

139
00:19:22,872 --> 00:19:26,865
All the Manchurian are after you,
and you're injured.

140
00:19:31,112 --> 00:19:34,821
I'll stay in this empty house tonight.

141
00:19:37,312 --> 00:19:40,543
You go look for Li Shih-Chung in town.

142
00:19:40,872 --> 00:19:44,626
Tell each of our men you meet
to wait there for me.

143
00:19:44,992 --> 00:19:46,425
Brother Hung.

144
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,189
I'll stay with you.

145
00:19:50,632 --> 00:19:54,466
They'll easily find us if we're together.

146
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:56,463
Remember you must avenge
your father's death.

147
00:19:56,632 --> 00:19:57,587
But you're injured!

148
00:19:57,752 --> 00:20:00,789
I'm asking you to go.
Obey your elder brother.

149
00:20:02,472 --> 00:20:06,465
If we go different ways,
we'll have more chance

150
00:20:06,632 --> 00:20:09,192
of meeting our men.

151
00:20:09,352 --> 00:20:10,387
Sure!

152
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,787
Master, why do you
let a Shaolin man go?

153
00:21:23,952 --> 00:21:25,670
I'm saving your lives.

154
00:21:25,832 --> 00:21:28,392
You mean we can't beat him?

155
00:21:28,552 --> 00:21:31,828
Tiger Lei was good, but he killed him.

156
00:21:44,912 --> 00:21:47,984
I've been drinking the whole night,
I don't even know who paid for me.

157
00:22:32,272 --> 00:22:33,387
Take your hands off him.

158
00:23:03,312 --> 00:23:04,427
Come back.

159
00:23:07,632 --> 00:23:10,305
I just didn't want to get involved.

160
00:23:11,472 --> 00:23:12,825
Let's give a look.

161
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:27,180
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

162
00:23:27,352 --> 00:23:30,708
Why did a man like you
commit such unforgivable crimes?

163
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,030
You're good,

164
00:24:11,192 --> 00:24:13,865
but you are injured and
I don't want to take advantage.

165
00:24:14,032 --> 00:24:15,624
Let's fight again when you recover.

166
00:24:19,392 --> 00:24:21,462
I don't need help when I'm fighting.

167
00:24:24,312 --> 00:24:25,904
Hung, you are not a man.

168
00:24:47,632 --> 00:24:51,341
Hero Fang, get him quickly,
or else, he'll kill all of us.

169
00:25:08,912 --> 00:25:10,311
You are...

170
00:25:14,632 --> 00:25:19,183
Why did he stop suddenly during the fight?

171
00:25:20,592 --> 00:25:23,868
Hero Fang, thanks for your help.

172
00:25:24,032 --> 00:25:26,182
Don't mention it.

173
00:25:26,472 --> 00:25:29,111
This man is a Kung Fu expert.

174
00:25:29,272 --> 00:25:30,910
He deserves an easy death.

175
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:34,144
We don't kill the innocent. Don't worry.

176
00:25:39,632 --> 00:25:41,588
By the way, what's your name?

177
00:25:41,752 --> 00:25:43,470
My name is Mai Hsin.

178
00:25:43,632 --> 00:25:46,590
- Master Mai, see you again.
- Bye.

179
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:55,705
Guys like you! I despise you, go away.

180
00:26:39,192 --> 00:26:43,185
I don't want to trouble the Yamen.

181
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:46,071
The reason I came here is because
Master Hsiang said you're loyal to us.

182
00:26:46,232 --> 00:26:50,987
Gen. Teh, it's an honor to have you here.

183
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:54,940
Gen. Teh caught Hung, the rebel No. 1.

184
00:26:55,112 --> 00:26:56,784
Indeed a great victory for you.

185
00:26:57,992 --> 00:27:02,508
I just managed to nip a small robber.
Nothing worth a mention.

186
00:27:03,072 --> 00:27:04,664
Yes.

187
00:27:07,832 --> 00:27:10,027
Rebel Hung His-kung has been brought here.

188
00:27:32,312 --> 00:27:33,904
Where is him?

189
00:27:34,072 --> 00:27:35,391
Inside the cage.

190
00:27:38,392 --> 00:27:41,464
General, the prisoner is fierce. I...

191
00:27:41,632 --> 00:27:44,271
Free him.
Let's witness how fierce he is!

192
00:27:52,312 --> 00:27:53,950
Open it.

193
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:55,622
So audacious! On your knees and beg

194
00:28:55,792 --> 00:28:58,101
the General for mercy.

195
00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:00,463
Hands off!

196
00:29:03,152 --> 00:29:04,301
Shut up.

197
00:29:08,272 --> 00:29:10,740
Where is Fang Shih-Yu?

198
00:29:11,192 --> 00:29:13,990
He's done his job. He has left.

199
00:30:21,792 --> 00:30:22,747
Hold it!

200
00:30:22,912 --> 00:30:25,904
I want to question him.
Even though we destroy Shaolin Monastery,

201
00:30:26,072 --> 00:30:28,540
but he knows all the Shaolin men

202
00:30:28,712 --> 00:30:30,748
in Kwangtung and Fukien.

203
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:11,748
Sister, it's been a long time.

204
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:14,107
Are you still in grief?

205
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,421
Come on, cheer up.

206
00:31:25,072 --> 00:31:27,825
Everyone, have a look.

207
00:31:27,992 --> 00:31:31,541
This is the hero Fang Shih-Yu.

208
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,466
What's the matter?

209
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:40,709
Is this man Fang Shih-Yu?

210
00:31:40,872 --> 00:31:42,942
What's the matter with you all?

211
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:48,702
Is there anything wrong with Master Li?

212
00:31:48,872 --> 00:31:49,622
Stupid!

213
00:31:51,432 --> 00:31:53,263
You're still so stubborn!

214
00:31:53,432 --> 00:31:55,787
Someone ought to fix you and your attitude.

215
00:32:01,992 --> 00:32:03,664
Did you hear that?

216
00:32:03,832 --> 00:32:06,983
He took care of Hung and now
he wants to take on Master Li.

217
00:32:07,152 --> 00:32:09,541
I was told Fang is not that kind of man.

218
00:32:09,712 --> 00:32:11,703
But it couldn't be wrong.

219
00:32:11,872 --> 00:32:14,591
They didn't make up the story.

220
00:32:30,072 --> 00:32:33,144
Fang is also a Shaolin disciple.

221
00:32:33,312 --> 00:32:36,622
But he helped the Manchu to arrest Hung.

222
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:39,022
I'd better report it to Teacher Wu Mei.

223
00:32:39,192 --> 00:32:43,390
Something' fishy, I reckon!
Fang is not that kind of man.

224
00:32:43,752 --> 00:32:46,903
After I heard the monastery was burned down,

225
00:32:47,072 --> 00:32:50,985
I sent my men to look for survivors.

226
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:55,221
But before my man could find Hung,

227
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:58,464
he had been arrested.

228
00:32:58,632 --> 00:33:00,190
My men followed them.

229
00:33:00,352 --> 00:33:03,708
They heard that Hung kept on yelling.

230
00:33:03,872 --> 00:33:06,067
He said Fang help the Manchu dogs.

231
00:33:07,272 --> 00:33:08,387
It's strange that the local authorities

232
00:33:08,552 --> 00:33:12,022
are not aware as to where
Hung Hsi-Kwan is been kept now.

233
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:14,422
And they lack no special precautions.

234
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,389
I think Brother Hung must be dead.

235
00:33:20,912 --> 00:33:23,472
Hung His-Kwan in Manchu's captivity!

236
00:33:23,832 --> 00:33:25,902
They might make him suffer,

237
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:28,622
but they won't kill him.

238
00:33:29,072 --> 00:33:32,587
They'll keep him alive for information.

239
00:34:32,712 --> 00:34:34,862
Your cellar makes an ideal prison.

240
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:38,069
Harsh punishment is what

241
00:34:38,232 --> 00:34:40,871
some people need.

242
00:34:41,032 --> 00:34:43,466
I'm not exaggerating, Hung been kept here.

243
00:34:43,632 --> 00:34:46,430
Even if he could fly, he still can't escape.

244
00:34:46,592 --> 00:34:48,423
I'll make him talk,

245
00:34:48,872 --> 00:34:50,464
even if I have to cut him into pieces.

246
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:53,100
- I'll get him talking!
- Yes!

247
00:34:53,272 --> 00:34:56,548
I heard there is a Li Shih-Chung in town,

248
00:34:56,712 --> 00:34:59,226
whom everyone respects,

249
00:34:59,392 --> 00:35:02,145
- and people address him as "Master".
- Yes...

250
00:35:02,632 --> 00:35:05,146
but this Li Shih-Chung
is always against us.

251
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:08,190
Strangers always visit his home

252
00:35:08,352 --> 00:35:11,150
To me he seems a suspicious character!

253
00:35:12,392 --> 00:35:15,668
Send more men to keep an eye on him.

254
00:35:16,552 --> 00:35:17,587
Yes, General.

255
00:35:18,072 --> 00:35:21,621
Fang is important in Shaolin.

256
00:35:21,792 --> 00:35:25,228
We should take care of this rebel too.

257
00:35:28,072 --> 00:35:31,747
Fang Shih-Yu, we don't have to do that.

258
00:35:32,912 --> 00:35:36,951
His own men will fix him up.

259
00:35:38,232 --> 00:35:39,665
Fang Shih-Yu has come!

260
00:35:41,192 --> 00:35:42,147
Alone?

261
00:35:42,312 --> 00:35:45,110
Yes, he is alone.
He said he wants to see you.

262
00:35:45,272 --> 00:35:46,387
That bastard!

263
00:35:46,552 --> 00:35:48,270
Calm down.

264
00:35:48,472 --> 00:35:50,747
Tell the guard outside to let him in.

265
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,628
Yes.

266
00:36:13,632 --> 00:36:18,148
What's wrong?
Master always used to welcome me.

267
00:36:19,312 --> 00:36:20,904
What's wrong today?

268
00:36:24,952 --> 00:36:27,227
Everyone is acting a bit strange.

269
00:36:44,072 --> 00:36:46,825
Getting a bit snobbish, are we!

270
00:36:47,392 --> 00:36:48,108
What do you want?

271
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:49,705
A good question...

272
00:36:49,992 --> 00:36:51,869
... "what do I want?"!

273
00:36:53,032 --> 00:36:56,229
If you don't like me, I won't come again.

274
00:36:56,392 --> 00:36:59,668
But I'd rather clear up one thing first.

275
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:03,866
The Manchu burned down the Monastery and
killed our man. What are you going to do?

276
00:37:04,032 --> 00:37:04,987
I know!

277
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:08,906
They burned the Monastery and
caught Hung after he...

278
00:37:09,072 --> 00:37:10,551
escaped from the fire.

279
00:37:24,112 --> 00:37:25,943
Li Shih-Chung, who are these people?

280
00:37:26,752 --> 00:37:30,427
Patriots sworn to restore the Ming Dynasty.

281
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:04,068
Li Shih-Chung, you've gone over to the Manchu.

282
00:38:04,232 --> 00:38:06,587
You must be dreaming if you want to get me!

283
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:08,982
You traitor!

284
00:38:23,152 --> 00:38:25,461
Fang Shih-Yu, how dare you?

285
00:38:37,512 --> 00:38:39,946
All of you are behaving like lunatics.

286
00:38:40,112 --> 00:38:42,387
You helped them get Hung, now repent.

287
00:38:42,952 --> 00:38:44,624
You eat too many onions
and hence fart a lot!

288
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:46,908
We all know it. You can't deny it.

289
00:38:48,152 --> 00:38:50,382
I never deny what I have done.

290
00:38:50,552 --> 00:38:53,589
Well, Hung escaped from the Monastery

291
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:57,271
and you helped the Manchu get him.

292
00:38:57,432 --> 00:38:58,945
Nonsense!

293
00:39:00,392 --> 00:39:02,781
His name was Hung.

294
00:39:03,432 --> 00:39:05,992
So he was Hung Hsi-Kwan!

295
00:39:15,792 --> 00:39:17,464
Now you can't deny it any more!

296
00:39:29,912 --> 00:39:32,426
Don't stop me, I'll kill him!

297
00:39:32,592 --> 00:39:35,550
Don't hold him back, let him kill me.

298
00:39:35,712 --> 00:39:37,464
Let him kill me!

299
00:39:37,632 --> 00:39:40,749
What are you waiting for? Kill me!

300
00:39:45,512 --> 00:39:47,582
What are you waiting for?!

301
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,947
Why don't you kill me?!

302
00:40:35,512 --> 00:40:39,664
- Bring your best food.
- Yes.

303
00:40:47,432 --> 00:40:49,229
Sir, that is too much.

304
00:40:49,392 --> 00:40:53,021
I can afford more than that.

305
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,110
Please sit down.

306
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:02,711
Be seated please.

307
00:41:31,752 --> 00:41:34,824
- Have they gone?
- Not yet,

308
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,790
they want...

309
00:41:37,952 --> 00:41:39,863
I know. They're all the same.

310
00:41:40,112 --> 00:41:43,104
But we can't offend these two men,

311
00:41:43,272 --> 00:41:44,864
the Manchu is a higer ranking officer.

312
00:41:45,032 --> 00:41:47,671
I heard Hsiang said they are...

313
00:41:47,832 --> 00:41:51,142
staying at Ho Chu-Chen's home.

314
00:41:52,072 --> 00:41:57,430
I think Hung is being held up
in Ho's cellar.

315
00:41:58,632 --> 00:41:59,587
Are you sure?

316
00:41:59,752 --> 00:42:00,582
Yes, I am.

317
00:42:00,912 --> 00:42:04,188
Well, I'll go to Master Li's home.

318
00:42:07,552 --> 00:42:08,621
Come on.

319
00:42:20,232 --> 00:42:22,700
- Please.
- Where's your hostess?

320
00:42:22,872 --> 00:42:25,705
Lord Teh wants to see her.

321
00:42:25,872 --> 00:42:29,069
I'm really sorry,
our hostess is a widow,

322
00:42:29,232 --> 00:42:32,463
she won't drink with strangers.

323
00:42:33,712 --> 00:42:36,784
A young widow must be lonely,
come on, ask her to come out.

324
00:42:38,032 --> 00:42:40,387
If you won't go, I will.

325
00:43:04,392 --> 00:43:07,270
Bastard, did you tell her to run away?

326
00:43:11,392 --> 00:43:13,428
Tear the place down!

327
00:43:29,872 --> 00:43:32,102
You savages!

328
00:43:32,272 --> 00:43:34,786
- We'll go to the law!
- We'll go to the law!

329
00:43:35,072 --> 00:43:39,429
Law? What law? I'm the law here.

330
00:43:40,792 --> 00:43:42,350
Let's go!

331
00:43:54,872 --> 00:43:58,182
Bring me back the woman,
or I'll scalp you.

332
00:43:58,352 --> 00:44:01,788
Release me, my lord, I'll find her.

333
00:44:01,952 --> 00:44:03,863
Release me, my lord!

334
00:44:11,032 --> 00:44:12,909
I see.

335
00:44:13,072 --> 00:44:16,701
No wonder we couldn't find Hung.

336
00:44:16,872 --> 00:44:19,227
Master, let's rescue him now.

337
00:44:19,832 --> 00:44:21,470
Master, I'll go now.

338
00:44:23,552 --> 00:44:26,908
Madam, The man with Hsiang,

339
00:44:27,072 --> 00:44:29,427
is Teh Hsiang, he is fierce

340
00:44:29,592 --> 00:44:33,062
and you didn't please him.

341
00:44:33,232 --> 00:44:36,508
He'd have destroyed your place by now.
You'd better not go back.

342
00:44:36,672 --> 00:44:39,948
My late husband left me the restaurant.

343
00:44:40,112 --> 00:44:41,591
I must keep it.

344
00:44:41,792 --> 00:44:42,747
However...

345
00:44:42,912 --> 00:44:44,948
I'm not afraid. If they try to force me,

346
00:44:46,952 --> 00:44:48,988
I'd rather die.

347
00:44:55,352 --> 00:44:56,626
That is...

348
00:44:57,832 --> 00:45:00,141
Don't you recognize him?

349
00:45:00,312 --> 00:45:01,506
He is Fang Shih-Yu.

350
00:45:02,592 --> 00:45:05,470
Why do you harbor this kind of a man?

351
00:45:05,632 --> 00:45:08,226
Madam, he was fooled by the Manchu.

352
00:45:16,552 --> 00:45:19,225
Madam, you have a knife.

353
00:45:19,392 --> 00:45:20,620
Kill me!

354
00:45:20,912 --> 00:45:23,187
Shih-Yu, we know where Hung Hsi-Kwan is.

355
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:25,222
Where is he?

356
00:45:25,672 --> 00:45:28,232
In Ho Chu-Chen's home cellar.

357
00:45:28,672 --> 00:45:30,105
Where is it? Take me there quickly.

358
00:45:30,272 --> 00:45:31,500
Listen.

359
00:45:33,472 --> 00:45:35,383
We must plan carefully.

360
00:45:35,552 --> 00:45:36,951
It's all my fault!

361
00:45:37,232 --> 00:45:39,621
Let me get him out.

362
00:45:39,792 --> 00:45:41,384
But there are many Manchu Kung Fu experts.

363
00:45:41,552 --> 00:45:43,622
I'm not afraid of them.

364
00:45:43,792 --> 00:45:45,623
But you will get yourself killed!

365
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:50,271
Madam, wait a minute.

366
00:45:51,392 --> 00:45:54,589
We need your help,

367
00:45:55,312 --> 00:45:56,870
- but...
- Please?

368
00:45:57,032 --> 00:45:59,500
It doesn't matter, my life can be spared.

369
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:03,301
Che Kang is a top Kung Fu expert.

370
00:46:03,472 --> 00:46:06,191
Together with Hsiang, Teh and him

371
00:46:06,352 --> 00:46:10,425
we can never beat them.

372
00:46:11,992 --> 00:46:15,871
We've got to corner them separately.
Teh wants to take advantage of you.

373
00:46:16,792 --> 00:46:18,464
Yes, that is it!

374
00:46:58,192 --> 00:47:00,945
The hostess is back.

375
00:47:05,872 --> 00:47:06,827
Ehi!

376
00:47:12,072 --> 00:47:15,382
Why is that guy walking like that?

377
00:47:38,752 --> 00:47:41,391
What? Follow her,
Lord Teh wants that woman.

378
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:43,948
I want you.

379
00:48:12,872 --> 00:48:15,511
Is Hung Hsi-Kwan in Ho's cellar?

380
00:48:15,672 --> 00:48:16,627
Yes.

381
00:48:16,792 --> 00:48:18,020
Anyone else there?

382
00:48:18,352 --> 00:48:20,627
- Release me!
- Who else?

383
00:48:20,952 --> 00:48:23,591
General Che, Lord Teh, and many others.

384
00:48:23,752 --> 00:48:25,583
How do I find the cellar?

385
00:48:27,392 --> 00:48:30,941
Through the iron gate in the back yard.

386
00:48:31,112 --> 00:48:32,147
What do you want? Release me!

387
00:48:44,432 --> 00:48:48,186
If I liked killing, you'd be a goner now.

388
00:48:48,352 --> 00:48:50,343
But I only broke your arms.

389
00:48:50,512 --> 00:48:53,470
You'd better go home,

390
00:48:53,632 --> 00:48:55,350
if I meet you again, I'll kill you.

391
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:19,745
Tell your Lord Teh I want to see him.

392
00:49:51,464 --> 00:49:52,533
Lord Teh.

393
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:56,138
That woman want to see you.

394
00:49:56,304 --> 00:49:57,180
What's the matter?

395
00:49:58,104 --> 00:50:01,141
I've something to do, I'll be right back.

396
00:50:46,624 --> 00:50:48,342
Where is that woman?

397
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:50,699
She was here a minute ago.

398
00:50:53,304 --> 00:50:56,341
- Do you mean the restaurant hostess?
- Yes.

399
00:50:56,504 --> 00:50:58,779
- Is she inside?
- No.

400
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:02,057
- She went off in a hurry.
- Idiot! Get her quickly.

401
00:51:02,224 --> 00:51:03,179
Go!

402
00:52:02,544 --> 00:52:05,741
Hung, we leveled the Monastery

403
00:52:05,904 --> 00:52:07,383
and killed everybody inside.

404
00:52:07,544 --> 00:52:11,253
Do you think you can fight us single-handed?
You know how we got you.

405
00:52:11,424 --> 00:52:14,496
Even Fang knows to move with the tide.

406
00:52:17,544 --> 00:52:20,934
If you join us we'll spare you
and your men

407
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:22,776
who were against the Manchu.

408
00:52:22,944 --> 00:52:25,583
Hung, I know you are a great hero,

409
00:52:25,744 --> 00:52:28,975
If you die, misfortune will befall many.

410
00:52:29,144 --> 00:52:30,372
Tell Fang Shih-Yu to come see me.

411
00:52:30,544 --> 00:52:33,741
Fang Shih-Yu? He won't come to see you.

412
00:52:34,664 --> 00:52:36,734
Who said I won't come? Here I am!

413
00:52:45,584 --> 00:52:47,893
Are you the so-called General?

414
00:52:49,384 --> 00:52:50,339
Fang Shih-Yu!

415
00:52:56,104 --> 00:52:59,858
Brother Hung, forgive me, they fooled me.

416
00:53:00,024 --> 00:53:02,492
I thought you were a cold-blooded killer!

417
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:22,817
Brother Fang, if you could pull it out,
I should have done it earlier.

418
00:53:25,184 --> 00:53:27,823
You called me... brother?

419
00:53:37,344 --> 00:53:40,700
You can take my blow.
That's something.

420
00:53:40,864 --> 00:53:42,263
Release Brother Hung right away!

421
00:53:42,424 --> 00:53:46,258
Fang Shih-Yu, you and Hung better join us.

422
00:54:07,064 --> 00:54:11,057
Go away immediately!
You're injured, don't act foolish.

423
00:54:11,784 --> 00:54:15,538
Fang Shih-Yu, Hung is wiser than you.

424
00:55:33,464 --> 00:55:36,456
That's the real Fang Shih-Yu.

425
00:55:37,264 --> 00:55:39,095
I'll get him and you two will die together.

426
00:56:21,704 --> 00:56:24,502
General, Lord Teh was ambushed.

427
00:56:24,664 --> 00:56:26,256
Master Hsiang is seriously injured.

428
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:21,134
General Che, please help us.

429
00:58:22,184 --> 00:58:23,458
Idiots!

430
00:58:32,944 --> 00:58:36,016
General, I... 
I met Fang Shih-Yu.

431
00:58:37,144 --> 00:58:38,133
So what about it then?

432
00:58:38,504 --> 00:58:41,735
Fang is the best Kung Fu man
in Kwangtung, l...

433
00:58:41,904 --> 00:58:43,701
Fang Shih-Yu has been here.

434
00:58:43,864 --> 00:58:46,332
I wounded him, but he ran away.

435
00:58:48,264 --> 00:58:51,222
Li Shih-Chung attacked us.
Quickly dispatch men to get Li at his home.

436
00:58:51,384 --> 00:58:52,783
Forget it!

437
00:58:52,944 --> 00:58:55,902
He is ready for us.

438
00:59:16,384 --> 00:59:17,783
Stay here.

439
00:59:34,544 --> 00:59:36,739
- What's happen?
- Fang Shih-Yu!

440
00:59:36,904 --> 00:59:38,098
He's injured!

441
00:59:39,304 --> 00:59:40,134
Where is Brother Hung?

442
00:59:43,624 --> 00:59:46,263
I never knew Che's Kung Fu was so good.

443
00:59:46,704 --> 00:59:48,422
I tried my best but couldn't beat him.

444
00:59:49,384 --> 00:59:50,703
You should!

445
00:59:50,864 --> 00:59:53,014
It's you who got Hung into this.

446
01:00:01,024 --> 01:00:04,619
I was injured. If at that time

447
01:00:04,784 --> 01:00:06,900
Hung Hsi-kwan, the man I respect,

448
01:00:07,984 --> 01:00:11,135
would've helped Manchu to nab me,

449
01:00:11,704 --> 01:00:13,422
I'd hate him for the rest of my life.

450
01:00:14,144 --> 01:00:17,454
But he pardoned me and called me brother.

451
01:00:17,784 --> 01:00:21,060
I'm not afraid of death,
but I must keep my life

452
01:00:21,224 --> 01:00:23,818
to rescue Brother Hung.

453
01:00:24,264 --> 01:00:26,175
Don't blame me

454
01:00:39,904 --> 01:00:42,896
- Any news about Fang Shih-Yu?
- No.

455
01:00:44,704 --> 01:00:48,253
As long as Hung Hsi-Kwan is here
Fang Shih-Yu can't be far away.

456
01:00:48,424 --> 01:00:51,018
Go and get some information. Be careful.

457
01:00:51,184 --> 01:00:54,415
Strange, It's been 7 or 8 days
since Fang came here,

458
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:57,417
He hasn't tried anything after that!

459
01:00:57,584 --> 01:01:01,941
Maybe he fled because he can't beat you.

460
01:01:02,104 --> 01:01:05,016
General, if we behead Hung in public,

461
01:01:05,184 --> 01:01:07,459
maybe it'll force Fang to show up.

462
01:01:09,904 --> 01:01:12,338
That's not a bad idea!

463
01:01:12,864 --> 01:01:18,700
But this rebel hasn't told us anything.

464
01:01:19,184 --> 01:01:22,779
Not only has he said nothing,
also the wound in his leg has healed.

465
01:01:22,944 --> 01:01:25,378
I think Master's plan won't work.

466
01:01:25,544 --> 01:01:28,217
It's useless to treat that guy well.

467
01:01:28,504 --> 01:01:31,064
Hung Hsi-Kwan really has an iron will.

468
01:01:31,224 --> 01:01:33,897
If he would only join us...

469
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:37,297
Tell the town office to post notices.

470
01:01:37,464 --> 01:01:39,614
Unless they don't want to rescue Hung,

471
01:01:39,784 --> 01:01:41,581
I'm sure they'll show up.

472
01:01:55,984 --> 01:01:58,896
Are they going to execute Hung tomorrow?

473
01:02:03,464 --> 01:02:05,022
Then let's rescue him there!

474
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:08,774
Che Kang is a cunning man,
he might be expecting that.

475
01:02:08,944 --> 01:02:10,616
It is a trap.

476
01:02:10,784 --> 01:02:13,503
I'll try, even if it is a trap.

477
01:02:13,784 --> 01:02:16,423
What about the tunnel Fang is digging?

478
01:02:16,584 --> 01:02:18,620
I don't know.

479
01:02:19,184 --> 01:02:21,379
We think it's useless.

480
01:02:21,544 --> 01:02:25,822
But Fang said he saw Hung shackled
to the stone wall of the cellar.

481
01:02:25,984 --> 01:02:29,533
He said, the tunnel is the only hope

482
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,695
to rescue Hung Hsi-Kwan.

483
01:02:31,864 --> 01:02:36,176
But Hung is chained
and can't colaborate.

484
01:02:40,504 --> 01:02:44,383
He hasn't stopped digging for 7 or 8 days.

485
01:02:44,544 --> 01:02:48,901
Unlike us; we'll rest now and then.

486
01:02:52,784 --> 01:02:55,218
Maybe you don't know Fang Shih-Yu,

487
01:02:55,384 --> 01:02:57,693
but you should have heard about him.

488
01:02:58,064 --> 01:03:02,342
We've never seen him
working so hard before.

489
01:03:02,704 --> 01:03:05,138
Even if he can't save Hung Hsi-Kwan,

490
01:03:05,304 --> 01:03:09,263
it's a good lesson for Fang.

491
01:03:09,424 --> 01:03:11,892
Master, please don't say such things!

492
01:04:09,104 --> 01:04:12,892
Shih-Yu, you are killing yourself!

493
01:04:13,464 --> 01:04:15,853
It's too late, they've posted the notices,

494
01:04:16,024 --> 01:04:17,855
execution will be tomorrow at noon.

495
01:04:18,024 --> 01:04:19,457
Don't dare say that again!

496
01:04:19,824 --> 01:04:22,497
But they really are going to behead him!

497
01:04:39,984 --> 01:04:42,179
I've reached the cellar.
I can hear the sound of the wall.

498
01:05:02,864 --> 01:05:04,058
Brother Hung is right here...

499
01:05:04,224 --> 01:05:06,215
right here!

500
01:05:35,224 --> 01:05:37,454
Shih-Yu refuses to come out?

501
01:05:38,944 --> 01:05:41,617
He knows it's impossible to break the wall.

502
01:05:42,544 --> 01:05:46,093
And it's almost driving him crazy.

503
01:05:46,264 --> 01:05:48,983
We can see the stone wall now,
but we just can't break through it.

504
01:05:49,144 --> 01:05:51,135
We could use dynamite though!

505
01:05:51,304 --> 01:05:54,421
Then Hung would be the first to die.

506
01:05:56,824 --> 01:05:58,940
Let me take a look.

507
01:06:23,544 --> 01:06:25,535
Shih-Yu!

508
01:06:25,704 --> 01:06:29,253
Brother Hung is behind the wall.
He can hear my knocking.

509
01:06:29,424 --> 01:06:31,540
But I just can't reach him.

510
01:06:33,984 --> 01:06:35,622
It's useless.

511
01:06:37,624 --> 01:06:40,138
We've tried everything.

512
01:06:40,624 --> 01:06:42,262
But all attempts have been futile!

513
01:06:49,104 --> 01:06:50,423
What is this?

514
01:06:51,464 --> 01:06:56,538
I remember now,

515
01:06:56,864 --> 01:07:00,823
Brother Hung's hands and legs,
are bound up to the wall.

516
01:07:25,544 --> 01:07:27,102
I have an idea!

517
01:07:31,224 --> 01:07:32,577
Go!

518
01:08:21,064 --> 01:08:23,134
We've freed one of his hands.

519
01:08:23,304 --> 01:08:25,943
- Now the other.
- All right!

520
01:08:41,624 --> 01:08:43,933
Let's find his ankles.

521
01:09:09,464 --> 01:09:14,094
Hung Hsi-Kwan, this'll be your last meal,
which I'm here to serve you,

522
01:09:14,264 --> 01:09:17,256
so you can't blame me when you're in hell.

523
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:29,135
Do you want?

524
01:09:29,704 --> 01:09:30,898
Eat it!

525
01:11:06,264 --> 01:11:07,174
Brother Hung!

526
01:11:07,344 --> 01:11:08,743
Brother Fang!

527
01:11:15,384 --> 01:11:18,057
Brother Hung, l...

528
01:11:18,624 --> 01:11:21,821
One more sorry and you're not Fang Shih-Yu.

529
01:11:21,984 --> 01:11:23,019
Let's go.

530
01:11:43,744 --> 01:11:46,133
Water...
It's been days since I last washed.

531
01:11:57,624 --> 01:12:00,934
What a pity!
You didn't see how embarrassed

532
01:12:01,104 --> 01:12:05,097
the general and his men were,
when they heard the news.

533
01:12:14,944 --> 01:12:19,540
No one could free himself
from the shackles.

534
01:12:24,984 --> 01:12:28,294
Someone dug a tunnel behind the wall.

535
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:31,781
Break the wall,
let's check the tunnel.

536
01:12:31,944 --> 01:12:33,013
I'm afraid they'll all be gone by now.

537
01:12:33,184 --> 01:12:36,142
Hung escaped but the others will be there.

538
01:12:48,744 --> 01:12:50,336
Let's go!

539
01:12:50,984 --> 01:12:52,463
Hurry up!

540
01:12:56,304 --> 01:12:57,259
Alright!

541
01:12:58,664 --> 01:13:00,143
You stay here.

542
01:13:12,504 --> 01:13:15,894
Bro. Hung, do you think Che Kang will come?

543
01:13:17,504 --> 01:13:21,463
He will, when he discovers the tunnel.

544
01:13:21,624 --> 01:13:24,855
Eventually they'll find the exit
of the tunnel, then they'll find our message.

545
01:13:25,024 --> 01:13:30,417
But a cunning man like Che Kang
will surely set trap before he comes.

546
01:13:49,304 --> 01:13:53,217
"Awaiting you at west ground.
Come if you've guts"

547
01:14:35,384 --> 01:14:39,741
Hung Hsi-Kwan and Fang Shih-Yu,
You're all here just as you promised.

548
01:14:40,344 --> 01:14:43,541
Che Kang, let's settle this once for all.

549
01:14:43,704 --> 01:14:46,537
Right, let's see who is the better man.

550
01:14:46,704 --> 01:14:50,982
I came here not only
to arrest all you rebels,

551
01:14:51,144 --> 01:14:55,854
but to meet the Chinese Kung Fu men.

552
01:14:56,184 --> 01:15:00,462
These are my brothers from Tibet.

553
01:15:00,624 --> 01:15:02,740
We studied Kung Fu together.

554
01:15:05,704 --> 01:15:07,899
They're called the four Red-robe Fighters.

555
01:15:08,064 --> 01:15:11,739
They too are eager meet Chinese Kung Fu men.

556
01:15:13,624 --> 01:15:17,060
We know Gen. Che's a Lama Kung Fu expert,

557
01:15:17,224 --> 01:15:18,816
well known in all regions.

558
01:15:18,984 --> 01:15:22,340
Looks like the whole Lama school is here!

559
01:15:22,504 --> 01:15:25,302
Let's start, stop talking nonsense.

560
01:15:26,784 --> 01:15:28,456
Alright.

561
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:31,582
It's important to arrest the rebels.

562
01:15:32,224 --> 01:15:34,579
You can all come out now.

563
01:15:34,744 --> 01:15:35,574
Yes!

564
01:20:59,864 --> 01:21:01,092
Help them!

565
01:24:20,704 --> 01:24:21,978
Warn!

566
01:24:25,544 --> 01:24:29,583
Shih-Yu, stork antics;

567
01:24:30,584 --> 01:24:33,621
and Hung, tiger style.

568
01:24:33,864 --> 01:24:36,617
Stork and tiger together

569
01:24:37,424 --> 01:24:40,780
can kill Che Kang.

570
01:25:42,464 --> 01:25:44,500
Brother Hung, use tiger claw!

571
01:25:53,704 --> 01:25:54,659
Tiger claw!

572
01:27:35,864 --> 01:27:37,502
Only four of us are left now.

573
01:27:37,664 --> 01:27:40,224
United we stand, divided we fall.

574
01:27:40,384 --> 01:27:42,898
As long as the Manchu are here,

575
01:27:43,064 --> 01:27:44,417
we'll never stop.

576
01:27:44,584 --> 01:27:48,463
Shaolin fraternity
are all over the country

577
01:27:48,624 --> 01:27:52,697
Today we've killed Che Kang.
Manchu will chase us to arrest us now.

578
01:27:52,864 --> 01:27:55,253
We must lay low for a while.

579
01:27:55,424 --> 01:27:58,143
Chaoching is my home town. I know it well.

580
01:27:58,304 --> 01:28:01,216
Let's go to Chaoching,
and find a good hiding place.

581
01:28:01,384 --> 01:28:04,456
Rally comrades, ready for a revolution.

582
01:28:04,624 --> 01:28:05,613
Yes!
