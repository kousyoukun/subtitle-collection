1
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:56,352
One, two, three....

2
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:57,763
Hold up.

3
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,402
Here's the story about a man

4
00:01:02,468 --> 00:01:03,810
A simple man

5
00:01:04,644 --> 00:01:08,255
A man with a dream
To do the world some good

6
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:10,815
Here's a story for rich and poor

7
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:12,920
For young and for old

8
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:17,240
About a man from the 'hood
Trying to do the world some good

9
00:01:17,634 --> 00:01:19,674
Here's the story about a man

10
00:01:20,545 --> 00:01:21,920
An everyday man

11
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,215
A man with a dream

12
00:01:25,281 --> 00:01:27,353
To be the head of state

13
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:35,385
Alderman Gilliam's office.
What are you upset about?

14
00:01:35,456 --> 00:01:37,626
It's not a black-owned business?

15
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:41,044
-But it's a Chinese food restaurant.
-So, what's with the fried rice?

16
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,118
I know it's fried rice, but it's not "fried" rice.

17
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,099
Alderman Gilliam's office.

18
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:48,378
Kim. How is it going, honey?

19
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:50,006
-Got tickets to the symphony.
-Really?

20
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:53,655
-Hold on a second, I got another call.
-You better not put me on hold.

21
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:56,179
Vote for Gaines and James.

22
00:01:56,252 --> 00:01:59,929
-The Million Babies Mamas March?
-It's a very good cause.

23
00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:02,362
Call Reverend Barton for that one. No...

24
00:02:02,428 --> 00:02:05,810
you can't use food stamps to buy tires.

25
00:02:06,971 --> 00:02:09,305
I'm sorry, Mr. Hawkins.
What can I do for you?

26
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:10,778
Your girlfriend is on hold.

27
00:02:10,842 --> 00:02:13,013
-Hold on a second.
-How could you put me on hold?

28
00:02:13,082 --> 00:02:15,765
-What was it, Mr. Hawkins?
-The bus.

29
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:18,419
I read that they're going to shut down
our bus line.

30
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:20,726
If they do that, I can't get to work!

31
00:02:20,793 --> 00:02:23,476
Unless they give me a job
in that new mall they're building.

32
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:26,163
Don't worry. I've been talking
to the people downtown...

33
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:27,694
and I promise you this:

34
00:02:27,768 --> 00:02:31,280
If they shut down this bus line,
I will drive you to work myself.

35
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,166
You got my word.

36
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:36,722
Alderman Gilliam, quick! Miss Pearl is back!

37
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,133
Okay. I got to go.

38
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:48,842
Hi, that's me, Mays Gilliam, alderman
of the 9th Ward of Washington, D.C.

39
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:51,377
Not the part of D.C. you're familiar with.

40
00:02:51,445 --> 00:02:55,471
I work in a neighborhood so bad,
you can get shot while you're getting shot.

41
00:02:55,732 --> 00:02:59,888
Around here when people have a problem,
they don't call the mayor, they call me.

42
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,763
Miss Pearl!

43
00:03:08,371 --> 00:03:09,897
What's going on?

44
00:03:12,338 --> 00:03:15,207
Dionne is in the house. I know she is.

45
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:19,056
I don't know what she's talking about.
We checked the house, nobody is in there.

46
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:21,128
Hey, man, Dionne is her cat.

47
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,754
Whatever. Cats got nine lives. She'll be fine.

48
00:03:23,825 --> 00:03:26,541
Can we let one guy go in
and help this lady get her cat?

49
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:29,804
Can't do it. Once they laid the explosives,
there's nothing I can do.

50
00:03:29,872 --> 00:03:30,886
She just showed up.

51
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,959
You took the lady's house.
Can you at least let her get her cat?

52
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:36,006
We didn't take it, we gave her $40,000.

53
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:39,722
What kind of house is she supposed to get
with $40,000? A crack house?

54
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,929
I think she'd be happy to get out
of this rattrap.

55
00:03:41,998 --> 00:03:44,419
Who are you to call this place a rattrap?

56
00:03:44,494 --> 00:03:48,585
This is my neighborhood, where I'm from.
I got my first bike stolen right there.

57
00:03:48,653 --> 00:03:50,725
My daddy got his bike stolen right there.

58
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:54,725
When I have a son, I hope he's fortunate
enough to get stuck up right there.

59
00:03:54,796 --> 00:03:57,382
-Can't you let somebody go check?
-We already looked.

60
00:03:57,452 --> 00:03:59,590
There's nothing in there. We got work to do.

61
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:01,317
Leave the people alone, damn it!

62
00:04:01,387 --> 00:04:03,078
-Let's get this thing going.
-Come on.

63
00:04:03,147 --> 00:04:05,830
-Stop being in such a hurry.
-We've been here all morning.

64
00:04:05,899 --> 00:04:07,721
Let the lady go inside.

65
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:10,568
Come on, baby! Sugar baby.

66
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:14,021
Could you at least turn it off?
Let the lady get her cat.

67
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,351
Dionne, baby? I got something for you!

68
00:04:19,368 --> 00:04:20,612
Miss Pearl, no!

69
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:26,178
All right, turn it off.
Wait till this woman gets her cat.

70
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,708
Shit, it's not working!

71
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:28,896
Turn it off!

72
00:04:29,383 --> 00:04:31,652
She better get out, it's going to blow!

73
00:04:31,943 --> 00:04:34,277
Miss Pearl! Come out!

74
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,379
No, Mays!

75
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,648
You've only got a minute!

76
00:04:42,405 --> 00:04:44,412
-Fix it! Get to work.
-I'm trying.

77
00:04:44,805 --> 00:04:46,234
Get a union man on this.

78
00:04:46,757 --> 00:04:48,283
Get your ass out!

79
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,034
Miss Pearl, we got to get out of here.
They're going to blow this place up.

80
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:58,946
They wouldn't do that, baby!
They know we're in here.

81
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:03,037
I love you, I've known you a long time.
You've seen a lot in your life.

82
00:05:03,107 --> 00:05:05,976
You've seen churches burnt to the ground,
dogs sicced on kids...

83
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,188
you've seen Malcolm X and JFK killed.

84
00:05:08,258 --> 00:05:10,233
They shut up Muhammad Ali
and Richard Pryor.

85
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:12,891
They gave Magic Johnson AlDS,
turned Michael Jackson white.

86
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:16,124
Do you really think these people
give a damn about you?

87
00:05:37,054 --> 00:05:39,955
We interrupt the Jay-Z song
to bring you this special bulletin.

88
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:42,036
Presidential candidate Senator Gaines...

89
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:43,963
and his running mate,
General Olson James...

90
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:46,898
were both killed when their planes
crashed into each other.

91
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,972
We now return you to the Jay-Z song
already in progress.

92
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,038
What's up?

93
00:06:09,113 --> 00:06:12,309
Trying to be like you, hero!
What's up, man? Saving kittens?

94
00:06:12,377 --> 00:06:13,751
Don't steal my car now.

95
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:17,710
I don't want that garbage.
What will I do, feed your car to my car?

96
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,192
Let me get ten Nine Lives,
four Lucky Ducks, two Straight Pokers...

97
00:06:22,296 --> 00:06:24,335
three Crabpots and five Powerballs.

98
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,900
Thank you, here you go.

99
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,806
You all need to stop.

100
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,880
Why are all these people clapping?

101
00:06:40,948 --> 00:06:43,436
-You didn't see me on the news?
-No, I didn't.

102
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:45,492
I got meat!

103
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,100
More beef than East Coast, West Coast rap.
Check it out!

104
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:52,239
Superman! Saving lives and stuff.

105
00:06:52,307 --> 00:06:54,445
Why don't you cop
one of these pork chops?

106
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:57,613
Know what you need to do?
You need to leave. I won't tell you again.

107
00:06:57,682 --> 00:07:00,878
Nobody wants your meat.
Who the hell wants to buy stolen meat?

108
00:07:00,946 --> 00:07:03,247
-I'll take a T-bone.
-You like gizzards, too?

109
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:08,651
Did you hear about that guy
running for President?

110
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:10,281
Who will replace him?

111
00:07:10,352 --> 00:07:13,134
Maybe they should get Shaq.
Nobody can beat him.

112
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,502
Are you getting gas?
You're holding my line up.

113
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:16,877
Yeah, I'm sorry.

114
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:18,729
$10 on three.

115
00:07:28,942 --> 00:07:31,308
You've got a lot of nerve hanging up on me.

116
00:07:31,374 --> 00:07:32,453
Hanging up?

117
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,720
-What's going on?
-I'm leaving you! That's what's going on.

118
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,466
The only reason I accepted this engagement
ring from you in the first place...

119
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:42,282
is because I thought you had potential!

120
00:07:42,348 --> 00:07:44,519
I thought you wanted more!

121
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:48,073
Why can't you just play the game?
Wear a suit!

122
00:07:48,364 --> 00:07:50,152
Be a real politician!

123
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,382
What's my clothes have to do with....
Are you seeing somebody else?

124
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:55,392
I'm seeing everybody else!

125
00:07:56,234 --> 00:07:58,951
I've met mosquitoes
with more force than you.

126
00:07:59,018 --> 00:08:02,814
I'm tired of your little games,
tired of being your little secretary.

127
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:04,896
Here's the light bill. I didn't pay it.

128
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:07,303
Here's the cable bill. I didn't pay that, either.

129
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:09,889
And here's the bill for your car note.

130
00:08:10,184 --> 00:08:11,875
I hope they take it!

131
00:08:12,616 --> 00:08:14,755
Wait a minute, that's my car!

132
00:08:15,048 --> 00:08:16,455
Wait, come back!

133
00:08:17,703 --> 00:08:20,223
I hate that piece of shit!

134
00:08:21,222 --> 00:08:25,019
I'm tired of spending my time
waiting for you to quit acting like a child...

135
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:28,258
and act like a grown man
for a change, Mays!

136
00:08:28,518 --> 00:08:30,405
I need to get on with my life!

137
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,705
I want a house, I want children!

138
00:08:32,774 --> 00:08:35,773
I want to go on vacation!
You're horrible in bed!

139
00:08:36,357 --> 00:08:39,139
I am tired of being engaged.
I am tired of being--

140
00:08:43,204 --> 00:08:45,625
I wish you would.

141
00:08:49,891 --> 00:08:52,258
For the last time,
I'm not running for President.

142
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:56,217
I'm not crazy! Gaines was 20 points behind.
It's ten weeks to Election Day.

143
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,403
Damn it!

144
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:01,082
They should have known better
than to talk on a cell phone in a plane.

145
00:09:01,154 --> 00:09:03,325
-What about Sanderson?
-That's a joke.

146
00:09:03,393 --> 00:09:05,564
Lewis has been Vice-President
for eight years.

147
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:08,153
He's a war hero and Sharon Stone's cousin.
He can't lose.

148
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:09,851
-What about Mosley?
-Girls.

149
00:09:09,952 --> 00:09:11,032
-Connelly?
-Boys.

150
00:09:11,105 --> 00:09:12,861
-McMasters?
-Big boys.

151
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,197
So we concede the election to Lewis?

152
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:19,158
Nobody is talking about conceding,
Debra, but let's get real here.

153
00:09:19,328 --> 00:09:20,854
We'll lose this one.

154
00:09:21,503 --> 00:09:24,918
The thing to do is to set the party up
for the next election.

155
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:28,054
We need a candidate
that will put on a good show.

156
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:31,388
This isn't a circus,
it's a presidential election.

157
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:33,843
You can't just pick some guy...

158
00:09:34,494 --> 00:09:36,632
to run for President.

159
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,832
It's unprecedented,
but if I put in a call to the party chairman...

160
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:42,006
we find a candidate, he'll back him.

161
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:44,761
Who will run a race
they know they can't win?

162
00:09:44,828 --> 00:09:46,235
Who says he has to know?

163
00:09:54,651 --> 00:09:55,763
What the....

164
00:10:06,745 --> 00:10:07,955
What now?

165
00:10:11,608 --> 00:10:13,135
No, not my bike!

166
00:10:18,807 --> 00:10:21,654
When I went in there
I wasn't thinking about being a hero.

167
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:23,890
I was just trying to help Miss Pearl.

168
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,234
Miss Pearl.

169
00:10:25,846 --> 00:10:27,504
I think we found our man.

170
00:10:28,022 --> 00:10:29,778
Look at this! This is great!

171
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:31,947
This is America, see?

172
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:35,406
Little guy against the big guy,
corporations against the people.

173
00:10:35,476 --> 00:10:37,298
Young versus old. What's better than this?

174
00:10:37,365 --> 00:10:39,088
Give me a break!

175
00:10:39,284 --> 00:10:41,705
I am going to run an alderman
for President?

176
00:10:42,836 --> 00:10:44,559
He's not an alderman.

177
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,162
He's a hero.

178
00:10:47,123 --> 00:10:50,058
-Who doesn't like a hero?
-Big business loves a hero!

179
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,243
See?

180
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:53,616
You said we needed somebody
who can help the party.

181
00:10:53,682 --> 00:10:56,399
Now, how in the hell
does this guy help the party?

182
00:10:56,562 --> 00:10:57,969
I'm glad you asked.

183
00:10:58,577 --> 00:11:00,966
The United States is changing.
America is changing.

184
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,048
Inside of 20 years, you know the numbers...

185
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,862
20 percent black,
21 percent Asian, 39 percent Hispanic.

186
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:10,922
The minorities will be the majority.
The smartest thing we can do...

187
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:15,343
is be the first party
to nominate a minority for President.

188
00:11:15,536 --> 00:11:18,219
-How about a cripple?
-I don't think so, Charlie.

189
00:11:18,735 --> 00:11:22,695
Now, we'll lose, of course,
but the minorities will be happy.

190
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:27,623
The minorities will be happy
and they will vote for us in 2008...

191
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,545
because we've shown we support them.

192
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:32,101
And the white people will vote for us...

193
00:11:32,461 --> 00:11:34,882
-because our guy isn't black.
-You got my vote!

194
00:11:34,957 --> 00:11:38,305
Geller, see if you can track down
this Mays Gilliam.

195
00:11:40,524 --> 00:11:42,312
Go check our accounts.

196
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:54,822
Give me one good reason
why I should go along with this.

197
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:58,567
Don't you get it, Debra?
I intend to run for President in 2008.

198
00:12:00,489 --> 00:12:03,489
Now give me one reason why you shouldn't.

199
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:09,220
He would take a lot of work.

200
00:12:09,608 --> 00:12:11,495
We can run a background check...

201
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,665
but it's obvious
he's not a party line candidate.

202
00:12:13,735 --> 00:12:16,320
He's just some kid
who thinks he can make a difference.

203
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:19,140
Don't worry. Go out there,
put the machine behind him.

204
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:22,021
You get 25 points in the polls,
consider it a win.

205
00:12:22,502 --> 00:12:24,509
Make sure he doesn't embarrass us.

206
00:12:24,582 --> 00:12:27,069
After this is over, we get to work.

207
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:31,552
When I'm President, I'll take care of you.

208
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:35,901
Help me. They locked me out of my office.

209
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:38,590
I know. The mayor is fed up with you.

210
00:12:39,748 --> 00:12:42,846
How many times have I told you?
You got to quit trying to fix shit.

211
00:12:42,915 --> 00:12:45,915
I could've got you into the council
next term. Now you're red-lined.

212
00:12:45,987 --> 00:12:47,677
Shannon is taking over your district.

213
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:51,062
They need to smooth over the mall
situation, that bus thing is heating up.

214
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:54,040
-They don't trust you.
-I'm not the one stealing people's houses.

215
00:12:54,113 --> 00:12:57,080
That's what your problem is.
You got to work with us.

216
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:00,569
That shit you pulled over there
cost the city money.

217
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:02,550
Makes the mayor look bad.

218
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:07,288
Now, contrary to popular belief,
politics is no place to express yourself.

219
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,560
You want to get in, you got to fit in.

220
00:13:09,696 --> 00:13:12,510
And look at you.
Grow up, you got to dress better.

221
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,095
Even Puff Daddy wears a suit to court.

222
00:13:17,694 --> 00:13:20,247
I'm sorry, brother, but ain't nothing I can do.

223
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:25,781
-Nice car.
-Ain't it, though?

224
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:28,306
Got it for a song at a repo auction.

225
00:13:50,138 --> 00:13:52,472
He feels bad, mighty low

226
00:13:52,538 --> 00:13:54,294
Got nowhere to go

227
00:13:54,681 --> 00:13:56,950
What can you do when you're feeling low

228
00:13:57,017 --> 00:13:58,926
Man, I want to know

229
00:13:59,224 --> 00:14:02,868
He feels bad, mighty low
Got nowhere to go

230
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:06,192
What can you do when you're feeling low

231
00:14:06,551 --> 00:14:08,885
And your car just got repo'd

232
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:38,066
Here we are.

233
00:14:38,227 --> 00:14:40,332
Mays Gilliam, Debra Lassiter.

234
00:14:41,906 --> 00:14:44,045
Nice to meet you. Take a seat.

235
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:52,520
We know what happened today.
We know you lost your job.

236
00:14:53,841 --> 00:14:55,750
How do you know that? It just happened.

237
00:14:55,825 --> 00:14:58,126
We're the government. We know everything.

238
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:01,035
We'd like you to do something for us.

239
00:15:01,104 --> 00:15:04,486
Sure, I'd love to work
on a presidential campaign.

240
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:07,497
I'll make phone calls, send out fliers.

241
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:10,563
Who have you guys chosen
to run against Lewis?

242
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,388
That's exactly what we wanted
to talk to you about.

243
00:15:13,582 --> 00:15:16,713
We'd like you to run for President.

244
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:25,930
-Of what?
-The United States.

245
00:15:26,861 --> 00:15:28,803
-Of what?
-Of America.

246
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:30,144
Which America?

247
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,398
North...

248
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:33,412
America, Mays.

249
00:15:33,612 --> 00:15:35,138
Get out of here!

250
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,994
We're not joking.

251
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:40,672
We want you to be the nominee
for the office of President...

252
00:15:40,747 --> 00:15:42,983
of the United States of America.

253
00:15:48,137 --> 00:15:49,893
Let me get this straight.

254
00:15:49,961 --> 00:15:53,703
You guys couldn't find anybody else to run?
You couldn't find nobody?

255
00:15:53,896 --> 00:15:55,325
Something is wrong here.

256
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:57,408
You couldn't find a congressman...

257
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,000
a senator? I'm just an alderman.

258
00:16:00,104 --> 00:16:03,748
Congressmen, senators,
they work with other politicians.

259
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:06,687
You're an alderman.
You work with the people.

260
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:10,020
And that's what we want,
a man of the people.

261
00:16:10,118 --> 00:16:11,711
This is a big joke, right?

262
00:16:11,782 --> 00:16:13,789
They've got a hidden camera somewhere.

263
00:16:13,862 --> 00:16:17,058
You all will get a big laugh out of this.
You know what? I don't care.

264
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:20,442
One of you all will drive me home
because my bike is messed up.

265
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:22,490
You an American?

266
00:16:24,837 --> 00:16:27,258
-Are you an American?
-Yes.

267
00:16:28,772 --> 00:16:31,357
This isn't just an election. It's a moment.

268
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:34,872
This is the moment when you have
the opportunity to show boys and girls...

269
00:16:34,947 --> 00:16:37,183
men and women, what America is about.

270
00:16:38,146 --> 00:16:39,553
Look at that.

271
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:45,503
When I see that, I think of our forefathers
fighting to make this country what it is.

272
00:16:46,145 --> 00:16:50,618
When I see it I think about the guy who has
to scrub Lincoln's balls for minimum wage.

273
00:16:51,232 --> 00:16:54,647
That's why we want you.
You care about the little people.

274
00:16:55,488 --> 00:16:56,797
What will it be?

275
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:13,976
It gives me great honor...

276
00:17:14,206 --> 00:17:16,410
to accept the party's nomination...

277
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:17,883
for President...

278
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,699
of the United States of America.

279
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,449
No!

280
00:17:28,988 --> 00:17:31,508
Welcome to your campaign headquarters.

281
00:17:31,996 --> 00:17:35,378
These folks will do everything they can
to help you get elected.

282
00:17:35,546 --> 00:17:37,139
These are your people.

283
00:17:38,203 --> 00:17:40,090
Here. Let's take a look at this.

284
00:17:40,154 --> 00:17:42,739
Mark, is that cued up? Roll it, please.

285
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:52,143
This is a great spot.

286
00:17:53,209 --> 00:17:57,332
If you love America,
vote Mays Gilliam for President.

287
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:03,476
But I'm not in it.

288
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:05,716
You don't even see my face.

289
00:18:05,783 --> 00:18:07,921
It's a template.
We'll get you in there eventually.

290
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,379
There's a couple of people
I want you to meet.

291
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:13,301
This is your security director, Mr. Earl.

292
00:18:13,397 --> 00:18:15,950
-You'll be in good hands.
-Pleased to meet you, sir.

293
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:20,112
If you're in trouble, yell "Security!"
and my people will handle the situation.

294
00:18:20,277 --> 00:18:23,538
This is your decoy, Mays Junior.
He enters events before you.

295
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:26,321
If anything'll happen to you,
it'll happen to him first.

296
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:28,460
Tupac could have used a guy like you.

297
00:18:28,531 --> 00:18:32,786
This is Nicollette White, she's
your executive director of lnternal Liaisons.

298
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:35,120
Call me Nikki.
It will be a pleasure to serve you.

299
00:18:35,187 --> 00:18:38,186
I'm available to you around the clock,
just let me know.

300
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,508
-What does she do?
-She sleeps with you.

301
00:18:42,993 --> 00:18:45,295
We got tired of getting caught up
in sex scandals...

302
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:47,913
so we commissioned
our own team of super whores.

303
00:18:47,984 --> 00:18:49,577
You call yourself whores!

304
00:18:49,648 --> 00:18:51,503
Move that fat ass! One, two, three!

305
00:18:51,984 --> 00:18:54,634
-These girls are good.
-Good morning, Mays.

306
00:18:54,832 --> 00:18:58,661
I took the liberty of choosing some options
for this evening's fundraiser.

307
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:00,007
You don't mind, do you?

308
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,340
I'll wear whatever you need me to wear.
What fundraiser is this?

309
00:19:03,406 --> 00:19:06,253
Your coming out party.
Campaigns cost money.

310
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,587
The people you meet tonight
have plenty of it.

311
00:19:08,654 --> 00:19:10,595
Geller and I will advance the party...

312
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:13,287
and Mr. Earl will bring you at 8:00 sharp.

313
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:16,810
Here are your off-the-cuff remarks.
Learn them. See you later.

314
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,717
Remember, sir, just nod and move.
Nod and move.

315
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:31,559
What do you plan to do about taxes?

316
00:19:31,627 --> 00:19:34,016
Do you plan to support
paternal leave incentives?

317
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,065
Get my demo to somebody. Anybody.

318
00:19:36,746 --> 00:19:39,429
Don't take unscreened packages.
Security reasons.

319
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:42,598
You have some people to talk to.
Tomorrow, work.

320
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:45,054
Tonight, smile, shake hands,
and be nice to the wives.

321
00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:48,423
I'll double-check the PA system.
You'll make a brief statement at 11:00.

322
00:19:48,489 --> 00:19:49,666
Let's go.

323
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:00,893
Hi, how are you doing? All right.
You all right.

324
00:20:03,815 --> 00:20:06,498
-I wish you luck, sir.
-Arigatou.

325
00:20:09,702 --> 00:20:12,668
It's like Timberland,
and I got a bit of Missy moving up there...

326
00:20:12,741 --> 00:20:15,229
but I'm trying to go through
that Neptune feel--

327
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:17,537
Excuse me, the Teamsters are here.

328
00:20:17,861 --> 00:20:19,803
What are you doing talking to the help?

329
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:21,884
Gentlemen, Mr. Mays Gilliam.

330
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:25,501
Guys, I'm all for labor, I'm all for unions.

331
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:28,092
But you know and I know
that you will endorse Lewis.

332
00:20:28,163 --> 00:20:30,618
It's business.
We'll do what's best for the union.

333
00:20:30,691 --> 00:20:33,440
-Have you decided on a running mate?
-We're thinking about it.

334
00:20:33,506 --> 00:20:36,986
-You should consider Sanders.
-We're considering several options.

335
00:20:38,818 --> 00:20:39,865
Excuse me.

336
00:20:40,097 --> 00:20:41,242
Well, that depends.

337
00:20:41,313 --> 00:20:42,840
What's up with this guy?

338
00:20:42,913 --> 00:20:45,215
Track four. Check out track four.

339
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:52,509
What do you have there?

340
00:20:52,575 --> 00:20:55,542
We got shrimp puffs and cheese snacks...

341
00:20:55,615 --> 00:20:58,615
-just some finger foods.
-Thought that was you.

342
00:20:58,942 --> 00:21:01,211
So what's up with the two jobs? Bad credit?

343
00:21:01,278 --> 00:21:05,533
Why do I have to have bad credit?
Can't I be saving up for a car or for school?

344
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,053
Maybe I like to work? Excuse me.

345
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:11,447
I'm sorry. You know what?
I never got your name.

346
00:21:12,893 --> 00:21:16,121
Hey, Lisa Clark. Mays.
Why you being so rude, Lisa Clark?

347
00:21:16,188 --> 00:21:18,130
I am not being rude, I am working.

348
00:21:18,204 --> 00:21:20,855
We can't mingle with the guests.
Plus, I don't know you.

349
00:21:20,924 --> 00:21:23,444
-You know me.
-No, I don't know you.

350
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:24,595
But you know me.

351
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:27,384
You've come to the gas station
a couple of times...

352
00:21:27,451 --> 00:21:30,036
and I see you, but I don't know you.

353
00:21:30,106 --> 00:21:31,666
Let's get to know each other.

354
00:21:31,738 --> 00:21:33,298
-Let's dance.
-I have to work.

355
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:37,298
I know you're working. I'm working, too.
So let's keep working. Want to dance?

356
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,279
Okay, you'll get me in trouble.

357
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:48,983
I cannot believe
you got me out here like this.

358
00:21:49,176 --> 00:21:51,728
-Yeah, but you like it, right?
-A little.

359
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,971
I'm feeling it.

360
00:22:12,277 --> 00:22:13,902
Go ahead, girl, work it!

361
00:22:25,587 --> 00:22:28,685
Oh, my God. I'm having too much fun.
I got to get back to work.

362
00:22:28,755 --> 00:22:30,348
No, come on, stay!

363
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,138
Come on!

364
00:22:34,993 --> 00:22:37,611
Come on, brother,
I know you know how to do this dance.

365
00:22:37,681 --> 00:22:38,990
No, sorry, I don't.

366
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:42,090
I know you know
how to do the Electric Slide.

367
00:22:42,256 --> 00:22:44,776
No, I can't say that I do.

368
00:22:45,584 --> 00:22:47,372
Get your ass in there!

369
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,665
-What the hell is this?
-Where's Mays?

370
00:22:57,262 --> 00:22:58,342
Over there.

371
00:22:59,726 --> 00:23:01,416
-Oh, my God!
-We've got to stop him.

372
00:23:01,486 --> 00:23:02,828
Excuse us, please.

373
00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:07,683
I am getting so hot
I am gonna take my clothes off

374
00:23:07,757 --> 00:23:10,277
-What do you think you're doing?
-Stop it.

375
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:13,186
I'm just trying to get the party started.

376
00:23:14,444 --> 00:23:16,386
Throw your hands in the air

377
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,499
And wave them like you just don't care

378
00:23:18,571 --> 00:23:20,676
And if I got your vote for President

379
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:22,852
Let me hear you say, "Oh, yeah"

380
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:27,360
Shake that ass, Grandma!

381
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:29,957
Let me see you bounce!

382
00:23:30,506 --> 00:23:31,749
Bounce!

383
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,944
We got a couple of freaks over there.

384
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:39,144
Let me see you shake!

385
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:42,981
Crip walk!

386
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:55,261
The roof is on fire!

387
00:23:56,486 --> 00:23:57,828
No, it's a saying!

388
00:24:00,709 --> 00:24:02,531
It's just a saying. Come back!

389
00:24:05,189 --> 00:24:09,150
You turned the party out.
I have never seen anything like that.

390
00:24:09,252 --> 00:24:11,357
Great party. Too bad about the fire.

391
00:24:13,028 --> 00:24:16,028
-So, where are you off to now?
-I'm not even sure.

392
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,328
We start campaigning tomorrow.
We'll be all over the country.

393
00:24:20,323 --> 00:24:21,468
Need a ride home?

394
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:24,702
I still have to clean up.
I don't know how long that will take me.

395
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,177
I could wait.

396
00:24:26,754 --> 00:24:29,656
Are you sure?
I could send a car to pick you up.

397
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,769
No, thanks, but I got to go.

398
00:24:31,841 --> 00:24:33,467
It was good seeing you again.

399
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:36,090
You too, buddy, old pal.

400
00:24:37,569 --> 00:24:39,990
-Can I get a good-night kiss?
-No.

401
00:24:41,376 --> 00:24:43,383
-I'm coming!
-She's coming!

402
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:48,123
I got to go. Good luck,
and call me if you get a chance.

403
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,280
Didn't you see me talking?

404
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:54,621
What kind of display was that?

405
00:24:54,686 --> 00:24:56,344
I was getting the party started.

406
00:24:56,414 --> 00:24:59,414
If the party needs to get started,
I'll handle it.

407
00:24:59,806 --> 00:25:01,693
Just do what we say.

408
00:25:01,757 --> 00:25:04,856
I don't think everybody appreciated
what you did in there.

409
00:25:04,925 --> 00:25:06,550
We really had a great time.

410
00:25:06,621 --> 00:25:08,661
It was off the hizzle for shizzle.

411
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:11,988
-They liked it.
-I don't care what they liked.

412
00:25:12,187 --> 00:25:13,748
Mays, darling!

413
00:25:18,555 --> 00:25:21,903
Darling, are you done yet?
No? If not, it's okay. I can wait.

414
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:25,110
But if we hurry,
we'll be able to get a table at Jezebel's.

415
00:25:26,426 --> 00:25:28,498
Good evening. We're getting married.

416
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:30,579
I'm exhausted.

417
00:25:31,353 --> 00:25:32,629
Know what I can't decide?

418
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,664
I can't decide whether we should have
a DJ or a band.

419
00:25:37,689 --> 00:25:38,899
Security!

420
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:56,752
Thank you for inviting me
to the land of milk and honey.

421
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,860
It's you people, the dairy people...

422
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:01,650
people that make eggs, milk, cheese...

423
00:26:01,716 --> 00:26:04,683
butter, bacon, that make the country great.

424
00:26:04,852 --> 00:26:08,146
Milk makes the body good,
and you make the country good.

425
00:26:12,243 --> 00:26:15,177
Thank you for inviting me
to Memphis, Tennessee.

426
00:26:15,955 --> 00:26:18,824
It's people like you, the church people...

427
00:26:18,962 --> 00:26:22,890
who are the backbone
and the spirit of this great land of ours.

428
00:26:24,369 --> 00:26:28,231
I love the Lord,
and I love the King, Elvis Presley.

429
00:26:31,921 --> 00:26:36,044
I want to thank you for inviting me
to the Lone Star State.

430
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,566
Home of the cowboys!

431
00:26:40,751 --> 00:26:42,311
How about them Cowboys?

432
00:26:43,215 --> 00:26:45,702
It's people like you, the ranchers...

433
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:48,138
who are the backbone of this country.

434
00:26:49,518 --> 00:26:53,030
Now, before I go,
I got one more thing to say:

435
00:26:54,221 --> 00:26:57,450
The stars at night are big and bright

436
00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:00,417
Deep in the heart of Texas

437
00:27:04,204 --> 00:27:05,153
It's not bad.

438
00:27:05,227 --> 00:27:07,431
Will I get another speech anytime soon?

439
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:09,190
What's the matter with this speech?

440
00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:12,520
I should be talking about something
a little more relevant.

441
00:27:12,906 --> 00:27:13,888
Relevant?

442
00:27:13,962 --> 00:27:17,191
People would be cheering
if I read the recipe for corn bread.

443
00:27:17,258 --> 00:27:19,624
It's not working.
I'm only one point up in the polls.

444
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:23,202
Don't worry about the polls.
They're just a sampling. Polls change.

445
00:27:23,273 --> 00:27:24,734
Don't get ahead of yourself.

446
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,558
We're here to help.
The people really like you.

447
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:30,886
Cheer up, we'll be in Chicago in a few days.
You got a brother there.

448
00:27:30,952 --> 00:27:33,253
Then the people will find out
what you're all about.

449
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,905
Yeah, but I don't even know
what I'm all about.

450
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:46,364
In the latest polls, Mays Gilliam is up
just one point, to 10 percent.

451
00:27:46,566 --> 00:27:49,914
Vice President Brian Lewis
still holds a commanding 84 percent.

452
00:27:49,989 --> 00:27:51,876
Six percent are undecided, saying...

453
00:27:51,941 --> 00:27:55,552
they don't know who they're voting for,
they just know it's not Gilliam.

454
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,235
When you get out there, listen to the crowd.

455
00:27:58,308 --> 00:28:01,755
Talk to them, make it look like
you believe in what you're saying.

456
00:28:02,436 --> 00:28:04,988
I know we haven't exactly
always seen eye to eye...

457
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:07,132
but this is very important.

458
00:28:07,203 --> 00:28:09,788
-I can't stress that enough.
-Alderman Gilliam?

459
00:28:10,434 --> 00:28:13,565
There's a Mitch Gilliam outside.
He says he's your brother.

460
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,323
Send him in.

461
00:28:16,705 --> 00:28:20,414
Tonight, America will get
its first impressions of Mays Gilliam.

462
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:23,066
You know what they say
about first impressions.

463
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,829
Look at my little brother!
You said you'd call when you got here.

464
00:28:28,928 --> 00:28:31,709
I was trying to call you,
but I've been doing press all day.

465
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:33,947
My little brother, running for President.

466
00:28:34,016 --> 00:28:36,982
Let me introduce you to Martin Geller,
Debra Lassiter.

467
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:41,373
What's happening, baby? Thanks for what
you're doing for my brother. Appreciate it.

468
00:28:41,438 --> 00:28:43,227
How about you, thriller? What's going--

469
00:28:43,294 --> 00:28:45,814
Nice to meet you.
What do you do for a living?

470
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:50,103
I'm a bail bondsman.
I got an office on the Southside.

471
00:28:50,173 --> 00:28:52,312
-Bail bondsman.
-Yes, sir.

472
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,830
How's business?

473
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:02,201
I tell you how business is.
Business is great.

474
00:29:02,267 --> 00:29:03,957
Thank God for crime.

475
00:29:06,043 --> 00:29:09,010
Thank God for crime.
Could you give us a minute?

476
00:29:10,491 --> 00:29:11,538
Five.

477
00:29:13,881 --> 00:29:15,474
Nice. Real nice.

478
00:29:15,961 --> 00:29:19,157
Look at you, man!
I see you all on the shows, politicking.

479
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:21,559
You like the way your campaign is going?

480
00:29:21,624 --> 00:29:23,031
Look at this.

481
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,185
Let me ask you something, brother.
When they gonna let you speak?

482
00:29:27,256 --> 00:29:29,744
I've been talking all day.
I was talking to the press.

483
00:29:29,815 --> 00:29:33,077
You been talking, but when they gonna
let you speak your mind?

484
00:29:33,143 --> 00:29:35,892
This ain't you. You gonna say this shit?
This shit is booty.

485
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:39,602
Say this if you want to, watch that man
come sweep your butt off stage.

486
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:43,180
Look at this poster: "Mays."
Who are they talking about? Willie?

487
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:44,621
Let me tell you something.

488
00:29:44,694 --> 00:29:48,042
They're the everyday common folk,
working people. Laborers.

489
00:29:48,277 --> 00:29:50,219
Construction workers, nurses.

490
00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:52,660
Play the game
when you're working for them.

491
00:29:52,725 --> 00:29:55,408
This is your campaign.
You're supposed to be in charge.

492
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,536
It's time.

493
00:30:00,435 --> 00:30:01,548
I got to go.

494
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:08,172
I love you, man,
and I'm with you no matter what.

495
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:12,265
-Go get them.
-I'll see you out there.

496
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:15,658
Speak.

497
00:30:19,504 --> 00:30:22,886
Chicago, please welcome
your next president:

498
00:30:23,089 --> 00:30:25,390
Alderman Mays Gilliam.

499
00:30:44,365 --> 00:30:46,307
What the hell is he doing?

500
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,519
They had a speech written for me...

501
00:30:53,963 --> 00:30:55,851
about what the people need.

502
00:30:56,108 --> 00:30:58,212
But you guys are the people.

503
00:30:58,604 --> 00:30:59,880
You know what you need.

504
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:02,152
Better schools...

505
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:04,511
better jobs...

506
00:31:04,971 --> 00:31:06,432
Iess crime.

507
00:31:08,682 --> 00:31:11,300
How many of you, right now...

508
00:31:11,657 --> 00:31:16,163
work two jobs
just to have enough money to be broke?

509
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:18,215
That ain't right.

510
00:31:19,016 --> 00:31:22,179
If you work two jobs,
and at the end of the week...

511
00:31:22,344 --> 00:31:25,606
you got just enough money
to get your broke ass home...

512
00:31:25,768 --> 00:31:27,971
Iet me hear you say, "That ain't right!"

513
00:31:28,135 --> 00:31:29,379
That ain't right!

514
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:35,494
How many of you have children
that they call stupid?

515
00:31:35,974 --> 00:31:38,341
Don't be ashamed! It ain't your fault.

516
00:31:38,406 --> 00:31:41,951
I asked my niece the other day,
"What's four plus four?" She said, "44."

517
00:31:42,629 --> 00:31:45,662
But that ain't her fault!
That's the school's fault.

518
00:31:46,213 --> 00:31:49,660
If your child's school has old-ass books...

519
00:31:49,732 --> 00:31:53,146
and brand-new metal detectors,
let me hear you say, "That ain't right!"

520
00:31:53,219 --> 00:31:54,713
That ain't right!

521
00:31:54,884 --> 00:31:56,029
It ain't right.

522
00:31:56,099 --> 00:32:00,670
And now we got these corporations
stealing all the money.

523
00:32:01,058 --> 00:32:03,644
They ain't stealing their money,
they stealing our money!

524
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:04,892
The pension.

525
00:32:04,962 --> 00:32:06,904
You work for 35 years.

526
00:32:07,074 --> 00:32:10,902
You thought you'd leave your kids
a will, now you'll leave them a won't!

527
00:32:11,202 --> 00:32:14,496
You show up to get your pension,
they give you a pen!

528
00:32:14,913 --> 00:32:19,135
A damn pen! What in the hell
am I supposed to do with a pen?

529
00:32:19,296 --> 00:32:22,907
I should stab you in the neck
with this pen, Mr. Pension Taker.

530
00:32:23,072 --> 00:32:24,894
Get your hand out of my pocket!

531
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:28,348
Taking everybody's pension,
and nobody going to jail.

532
00:32:28,415 --> 00:32:30,684
That's some bullshit. Ain't it?

533
00:32:30,814 --> 00:32:34,425
Meanwhile, we steal a Big Mac with cheese...

534
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,501
next thing you know, we on Death Row!

535
00:32:36,573 --> 00:32:37,621
That ain't right!

536
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:45,271
How many of you work in a city
you can't afford to live in?

537
00:32:46,396 --> 00:32:47,476
That ain't right!

538
00:32:48,284 --> 00:32:51,927
How many of you work in a mall
you can't afford to shop in?

539
00:32:51,996 --> 00:32:53,239
That ain't right!

540
00:32:53,403 --> 00:32:56,021
How many of you clean up a hotel...

541
00:32:56,091 --> 00:32:58,578
you ain't never gonna be able to stay in?

542
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,087
That ain't right!

543
00:33:03,578 --> 00:33:08,312
We got nurses that work in hospitals
they can't even afford to get sick in.

544
00:33:09,881 --> 00:33:11,026
It ain't right!

545
00:33:14,393 --> 00:33:15,986
It isn't right!

546
00:33:17,304 --> 00:33:20,151
That shit is wrong!

547
00:33:22,199 --> 00:33:23,606
It's dead wrong!

548
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:28,879
I'm Mays Gilliam...

549
00:33:28,951 --> 00:33:32,398
and I'm running for President
of the United States of America.

550
00:33:41,525 --> 00:33:43,914
No questions. Sorry.

551
00:33:44,372 --> 00:33:45,801
Where's Mitch?

552
00:33:47,508 --> 00:33:51,304
Go to work. Handle your business.
If you need me, call me.

553
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:53,132
I'll call you.

554
00:33:53,427 --> 00:33:57,321
Are you insane? You can't just go out
in front of 5,000 people and talk!

555
00:33:57,491 --> 00:34:00,873
And you said "shit."
Presidential candidates do not say "shit."

556
00:34:00,946 --> 00:34:04,426
Show me a man that's never said shit,
I'll show you someone full of shit!

557
00:34:04,498 --> 00:34:05,545
Debra, hold on.

558
00:34:06,097 --> 00:34:08,846
What you just did, that was great.

559
00:34:09,009 --> 00:34:11,824
Maybe you're right.
We could tailor the speeches more to you.

560
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:13,133
My speeches?

561
00:34:13,201 --> 00:34:14,727
Come on, did you hear them?

562
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,280
If this is gonna work, it's got to fit me.
It's got to be my campaign.

563
00:34:18,352 --> 00:34:19,726
This is not your campaign.

564
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:22,987
You do what I tell you to,
or you'll be back in D.C. on your bicycle.

565
00:34:23,055 --> 00:34:25,160
I'm the one running for President.

566
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,328
If we're gonna run this campaign,
it's got to go my way.

567
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:30,340
We're gonna do it the way I want it done.

568
00:34:30,414 --> 00:34:32,967
Hold on.
I don't know if that's such a good idea.

569
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:35,623
If you don't know, you better ask somebody.

570
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:52,583
After a slow start, Mays Gilliam
has made some dramatic changes...

571
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,373
in his presidential campaign.

572
00:35:03,593 --> 00:35:08,132
Hi. I'm Mays Gilliam,
candidate for President of the United States.

573
00:35:08,424 --> 00:35:10,246
This is my new headquarters.

574
00:35:10,312 --> 00:35:14,305
The individuals you see before you
will help me guide my campaign.

575
00:35:15,016 --> 00:35:17,088
These are my people.

576
00:35:19,622 --> 00:35:22,589
Mays Gilliam is turning the establishment
on its ear...

577
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,964
with his new controversial campaign ads.

578
00:35:28,966 --> 00:35:33,122
If you love America,
vote Mays Gilliam for President.

579
00:35:33,893 --> 00:35:36,478
Paid for by Citizens for Mays Gilliam.

580
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:52,634
The part of Mays Gilliam's
security director...

581
00:35:52,707 --> 00:35:55,488
will now be played
by Muhammad Muhammad Muhammad.

582
00:35:57,026 --> 00:36:01,084
Childcare is one of the most important
issues facing this country today.

583
00:36:01,281 --> 00:36:04,063
The working mother
has to take her child to a nanny.

584
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:07,005
The nanny has to take her child
to a babysitter.

585
00:36:07,072 --> 00:36:09,723
The babysitter
has to take her child to daycare.

586
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:13,915
On the count of three, I want everybody
to take care of their own damn kids!

587
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:17,974
Whose baby is this? It ain't mine!

588
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,966
Gay people want what every American
wants. A good house, a good job!

589
00:36:23,262 --> 00:36:26,131
I believe in gay rights
because when I see gay people...

590
00:36:26,206 --> 00:36:29,948
all I'm seeing are people,
normal people like every other American.

591
00:36:36,605 --> 00:36:40,216
Thank you for inviting me
to the Player's Ball!

592
00:36:43,387 --> 00:36:45,492
America needs to change its ways.

593
00:36:45,915 --> 00:36:49,711
I promise if I'm your President,
I will take care of everybody:

594
00:36:49,978 --> 00:36:54,201
Big business and small business,
show business and ho business.

595
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:07,405
Hello, Debra.

596
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,429
Bill?

597
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:11,826
I am in Detroit at a Player's Ball
with pimps and whores.

598
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,748
Excuse me, hoes!

599
00:37:14,743 --> 00:37:17,809
I can't do this. You got to get me
out of here. I can't control him.

600
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:19,308
He won't listen to me!

601
00:37:19,382 --> 00:37:22,764
No, Debra.
I need you out there, and this is going great.

602
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,126
This is what we wanted.

603
00:37:26,293 --> 00:37:28,365
I love this guy. "That ain't right."

604
00:37:28,501 --> 00:37:30,289
He really thinks he can make a difference.

605
00:37:30,357 --> 00:37:33,357
Stop worrying. This will work out fine. Bye.

606
00:37:35,669 --> 00:37:36,945
Don't I know you?

607
00:37:37,108 --> 00:37:38,155
No!

608
00:37:47,987 --> 00:37:51,696
He feels good
Things are going his way

609
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:56,075
He just might be
The President someday

610
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:31,686
Mays, darling, I've been thinking.
I want a small wedding.

611
00:38:31,756 --> 00:38:34,276
I think I want 150, maybe 200 people.

612
00:38:34,444 --> 00:38:36,713
I've always said
I wanted a wedding in a church...

613
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,496
but lately I've been thinking about
the Botanical Gardens.

614
00:38:39,563 --> 00:38:41,985
We could do it by the tulips.
It'll be beautiful--

615
00:38:42,123 --> 00:38:43,399
Security!

616
00:38:57,481 --> 00:38:59,236
Who the hell is Mays Gilliam?

617
00:38:59,752 --> 00:39:01,279
He's running against you, sir.

618
00:39:01,449 --> 00:39:03,903
What happened to Gaines?

619
00:39:03,976 --> 00:39:05,383
He died in a plane crash.

620
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:07,908
Get out of here! Gaines is dead?

621
00:39:08,072 --> 00:39:10,919
-Don't you remember? It was on the news!
-Not my news.

622
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:15,460
This fellow, Gilliam,
is an alderman from D.C.

623
00:39:16,007 --> 00:39:17,665
He took Gaines' place, sir.

624
00:39:17,735 --> 00:39:19,229
I'm running against this guy.

625
00:39:19,302 --> 00:39:20,195
Yes, sir.

626
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:22,944
That is some bullshit.

627
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:24,667
This is my time.

628
00:39:24,742 --> 00:39:26,978
I've been Vice President for eight years.

629
00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:30,654
I am a war hero,
and I am Sharon Stone's cousin!

630
00:39:31,173 --> 00:39:35,264
And I'll be damned if I'm going to let
my election be ruined by this asshole!

631
00:39:36,324 --> 00:39:39,837
I want this guy done. You hear me?
Finish him!

632
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:43,263
He will be destroyed, sir, as you wish.

633
00:39:44,003 --> 00:39:47,319
This is the White House
without Mays Gilliam. Peaceful, isn't it?

634
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:50,491
Now, this is the White House
if Gilliam is elected.

635
00:39:58,273 --> 00:40:00,639
Let's keep Mays Gilliam
out of the White House.

636
00:40:00,704 --> 00:40:03,519
Vote Brian Lewis for President.
It's your last chance.

637
00:40:05,088 --> 00:40:07,127
How do you want to handle this?

638
00:40:07,967 --> 00:40:09,822
I don't want to go negative.

639
00:40:11,007 --> 00:40:12,381
Nobody wants to hear that.

640
00:40:12,447 --> 00:40:15,229
I want people to vote for me,
not against Lewis.

641
00:40:15,327 --> 00:40:18,425
-People don't know what they want to hear.
-We have to respond.

642
00:40:18,494 --> 00:40:22,007
We should go with something measured,
accurate. Let's call him on his record!

643
00:40:22,078 --> 00:40:24,925
You can't challenge his record
when Mays doesn't have one.

644
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,298
How about a massage?

645
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:29,434
Ladies and gentlemen...

646
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,329
please welcome
presidential candidate Mays Gilliam.

647
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,559
Thank you!

648
00:40:45,882 --> 00:40:49,046
This is Conservative Talk 520.
You're listening to Big Dave.

649
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:52,659
Negative ads. Lewis is up, Gilliam is down.
I think it's great!

650
00:40:52,729 --> 00:40:53,677
Bottom line:

651
00:40:53,753 --> 00:40:57,048
I don't think I want Gilliam
and his homies to be in the White House.

652
00:40:58,969 --> 00:41:02,743
People are saying these ads
are dirty politics. Give me a small break!

653
00:41:02,808 --> 00:41:07,183
We're not talking about running
a rib shack but a country!

654
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:10,035
He's running for President
and every vote counts!

655
00:41:10,231 --> 00:41:12,914
Ladies and gentlemen, Mays Gilliam!

656
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:17,870
And if these ads are so bad,
why hasn't Gilliam said anything?

657
00:41:18,325 --> 00:41:19,667
Howard Stern rocks!

658
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,390
You're on with Big Dave.

659
00:41:21,461 --> 00:41:25,006
The reason Gilliam hasn't responded
is because he has too much integrity.

660
00:41:33,939 --> 00:41:37,386
We just got endorsements
from Raekwon the Chef...

661
00:41:37,587 --> 00:41:39,245
and Ghostface Killah.

662
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:41,521
-ls this good?
-It's great.

663
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:45,385
Where are we on this running mate thing?

664
00:41:45,746 --> 00:41:48,615
I've been making calls.
Nobody wants to run with you.

665
00:41:48,818 --> 00:41:50,159
Who did you call?

666
00:41:50,737 --> 00:41:52,199
Everybody.

667
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,185
Did you call Hammer?

668
00:41:54,993 --> 00:41:57,382
No, I did not call Hammer.

669
00:41:58,992 --> 00:42:00,880
Then you didn't call everybody.

670
00:42:01,232 --> 00:42:03,336
Mr. Gilliam, can I have your autograph?

671
00:42:03,407 --> 00:42:04,651
I'll be right back.

672
00:42:07,278 --> 00:42:09,351
-Should we call Hammer?
-No.

673
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,517
Say cheese!

674
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:16,678
Mays Gilliam did not attend
this year's annual rally against cancer.

675
00:42:17,805 --> 00:42:20,838
Is Mays Gilliam for cancer
or against cancer?

676
00:42:21,709 --> 00:42:24,327
Mays Gilliam, he's for cancer.

677
00:42:24,845 --> 00:42:28,521
Vote Brian Lewis for President.
It's your last chance.

678
00:42:30,284 --> 00:42:31,909
Cancer lover!

679
00:42:33,196 --> 00:42:35,978
No, he does not get away with this crap!

680
00:42:36,043 --> 00:42:38,464
This is what we'll do.
You ever watch Bugs Bunny?

681
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:43,175
Bugs would always shoot Elmer Fudd
in the face and drop an anvil on his head.

682
00:42:43,338 --> 00:42:46,534
But what made Elmer really mad
is when Bugs Bunny kissed him.

683
00:42:46,634 --> 00:42:48,325
We got to kiss this bitch.

684
00:42:48,681 --> 00:42:51,048
-How do you propose we do that?
-Watch this.

685
00:42:51,209 --> 00:42:55,267
I'm a Klansman. I hate niggers, Jews,
and fags, but I love Brian Lewis.

686
00:42:56,329 --> 00:42:58,663
Yo, what's up? I'm Osama Bin Laden.

687
00:42:58,888 --> 00:43:01,506
I hate America, but I love Brian Lewis.

688
00:43:01,767 --> 00:43:03,774
Paid for by Osama Bin Laden.

689
00:43:04,455 --> 00:43:06,594
Sharon Stone is a defector.

690
00:43:06,663 --> 00:43:09,979
That's what Lewis campaign insiders
are saying about the Hollywood star...

691
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:14,560
and cousin of Vice President Lewis,
after Stone's endorsement of Mays Gilliam.

692
00:43:14,629 --> 00:43:15,839
I don't believe it!

693
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:18,586
Yeah!

694
00:43:20,357 --> 00:43:21,698
I know!

695
00:43:22,341 --> 00:43:23,934
Did you hear....

696
00:43:25,796 --> 00:43:27,039
What are you doing here?

697
00:43:27,108 --> 00:43:29,758
Gilliam is over 30 points.

698
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:34,114
That means even if he loses
he's the frontrunner in 2008.

699
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:37,113
In case you've forgotten,
I intend to run for President in 2008...

700
00:43:37,187 --> 00:43:38,942
and I am not running against him.

701
00:43:39,298 --> 00:43:42,232
So this is over.
Either you put a stop to it or I will.

702
00:43:42,338 --> 00:43:45,883
I came on board to run a campaign
for a man we didn't expect to win...

703
00:43:46,017 --> 00:43:47,992
not to sabotage him so he'd lose.

704
00:43:48,065 --> 00:43:51,448
You're in this as thick as I am.
Of course he's supposed to lose!

705
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,895
That's why we picked him.

706
00:43:52,961 --> 00:43:55,295
Are you with me or are you with him?

707
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,432
I thought you wanted
what was best for the party.

708
00:43:57,504 --> 00:43:59,064
I'm what's best for the party!

709
00:44:00,032 --> 00:44:01,341
What's the matter?

710
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:04,505
Democracy doesn't work for you
when you're not winning?

711
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:07,420
I'm with him.

712
00:44:14,557 --> 00:44:15,834
I'm with him?

713
00:44:24,572 --> 00:44:27,321
-Who are these people again?
-The Urban Business Board.

714
00:44:27,387 --> 00:44:30,322
-What are your plans for Social Security?
-Give it to old people.

715
00:44:30,396 --> 00:44:32,730
-Your plans on global warming?
-Global ice tea.

716
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,387
-You the man!
-You the woman!

717
00:44:36,859 --> 00:44:39,608
I want to introduce you
to Chester Norris Allen.

718
00:44:39,898 --> 00:44:43,956
He owns a bottling plant in D.C.
and I spoke to him about our problem.

719
00:44:44,025 --> 00:44:45,454
We've got a nice check for you.

720
00:44:45,529 --> 00:44:48,114
We can't take it. You sell malt liquor to kids.

721
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,429
I do no such thing.

722
00:44:49,529 --> 00:44:53,554
Come on, man. It's orange beer
with a nipple top. Now, who's that for?

723
00:44:53,784 --> 00:44:55,377
It's Crib Malt Liquor, man!

724
00:44:55,544 --> 00:44:56,951
He's unbelievable!

725
00:44:57,591 --> 00:45:00,852
Damn it, we need that money!
Why do you make everything so difficult?

726
00:45:00,919 --> 00:45:02,828
It's Crib Malt Liquor!

727
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:06,133
"Crib Malt Liquor,
just like Mama used to make"?

728
00:45:06,198 --> 00:45:07,692
Whose mama? Not my mama!

729
00:45:08,502 --> 00:45:12,211
The situation is getting tense with the threat
of the bus line being shut down.

730
00:45:12,278 --> 00:45:15,092
Protestors took their concerns
to transit officials...

731
00:45:15,157 --> 00:45:18,986
but talks broke down when the newly
appointed alderman, Reginald Shannon...

732
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,678
was punched in the face
by an angry protestor.

733
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,416
-Good evening, sir.
-What's up, Nikki?

734
00:45:26,483 --> 00:45:30,094
I noticed you weren't at the party,
so I thought...

735
00:45:30,707 --> 00:45:34,962
if there is anything you would like
for me to do, I would be happy to.

736
00:45:36,146 --> 00:45:37,575
Could I ask you something?

737
00:45:38,898 --> 00:45:40,043
Yes.

738
00:45:41,297 --> 00:45:43,566
You seem like a nice girl.

739
00:45:45,169 --> 00:45:47,242
How did you get into this line of work?

740
00:45:52,848 --> 00:45:55,269
I went to the University of Nebraska...

741
00:45:55,439 --> 00:45:58,286
where I majored
in Theater and Communications.

742
00:45:58,479 --> 00:46:01,740
I did some extra work,
and a few things that went straight to video.

743
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:06,819
Okay.

744
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:08,902
Can I ask you a question?

745
00:46:08,973 --> 00:46:10,151
Yeah, sure.

746
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:14,540
Since I've been here, you haven't really
given me any assignments.

747
00:46:15,565 --> 00:46:17,899
I was wondering if you find me attractive.

748
00:46:21,932 --> 00:46:23,655
I think you're....

749
00:46:23,756 --> 00:46:26,505
I think you're very attractive. It's just that...

750
00:46:27,531 --> 00:46:31,971
I like to get to know people
before I get involved.

751
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:36,163
I don't mean to be out of line, sir...

752
00:46:37,865 --> 00:46:38,814
but are you?

753
00:46:42,025 --> 00:46:43,334
Am I what?

754
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:45,473
Trying to get to know somebody.

755
00:46:50,632 --> 00:46:53,893
-lt is late, I'm out of here.
-You need to take a cab.

756
00:46:54,472 --> 00:46:56,446
I'll be fine. I'm just gonna walk.

757
00:47:02,598 --> 00:47:04,191
Take a cab!

758
00:47:05,126 --> 00:47:07,231
I'll be fine. I'll walk.

759
00:47:14,853 --> 00:47:15,933
Need a ride?

760
00:47:22,116 --> 00:47:23,577
Where are we going?

761
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,952
I just thought I'd give you a little tour.

762
00:47:37,986 --> 00:47:41,281
If you look over there,
it's the Lincoln Memorial.

763
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:44,089
Lincoln freed the slaves...

764
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,837
but before he did it, he said,
"First you niggers got to build me a statue."

765
00:47:49,344 --> 00:47:52,159
Right there is the Jefferson Memorial.

766
00:47:52,224 --> 00:47:54,111
Jefferson had a black mistress.

767
00:47:54,175 --> 00:47:58,201
He said, "All men are created equal,
but black women got the nicest ass!"

768
00:48:00,446 --> 00:48:02,104
That's the Treasury.

769
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:05,848
If you look real hard in the window,
you can see Oprah counting her money.

770
00:48:07,742 --> 00:48:10,709
$20 trillion one, $20 trillion two....

771
00:48:10,845 --> 00:48:11,859
Hi, Oprah!

772
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,064
What's it like...

773
00:48:19,132 --> 00:48:23,026
traveling all over the country
and meeting all those people?

774
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:27,158
I like it. I like traveling,
I like meeting the people.

775
00:48:27,227 --> 00:48:31,416
But sometimes, you don't know
if people like you for you.

776
00:48:31,514 --> 00:48:33,903
-Know what I mean?
-I like you for you.

777
00:48:35,961 --> 00:48:37,783
And I think you're okay.

778
00:48:38,106 --> 00:48:39,960
-Just okay?
-I'm just playing.

779
00:48:42,905 --> 00:48:44,879
I forgot how nice D.C. was.

780
00:48:46,328 --> 00:48:49,077
I'm always working.
I never get a chance to check it out.

781
00:48:49,144 --> 00:48:52,274
Maybe you need to take advantage
of what's in front of you.

782
00:48:52,343 --> 00:48:56,467
You never know, you may look up someday,
and it might not be there.

783
00:49:01,014 --> 00:49:02,061
Freeze!

784
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:05,837
Put your hands up in the air
and step away from Mr. Gilliam!

785
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:07,054
It's okay!

786
00:49:07,254 --> 00:49:09,904
-What the hell are you doing?
-What the hell are you doing?

787
00:49:09,973 --> 00:49:13,769
You can't go dashing off
in the middle of the night with some girl.

788
00:49:13,844 --> 00:49:16,397
Something's happened.
We got to pack and get out of here!

789
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,889
Somebody make sure she gets home safely.

790
00:49:19,316 --> 00:49:21,323
We have a plane waiting for us.

791
00:49:27,026 --> 00:49:30,888
In Florida today, guns and explosives
were found at a junior high school.

792
00:49:30,962 --> 00:49:34,736
No one was injured in the incident,
but with just six weeks till Election Day...

793
00:49:34,961 --> 00:49:37,350
this could be a hot-button issue
for both parties.

794
00:49:37,425 --> 00:49:40,392
Now, back to the Jay-Z song
already in progress.

795
00:49:41,872 --> 00:49:45,036
Muhammad, get me a gun
in case another kid tries to get crazy.

796
00:49:45,104 --> 00:49:48,616
This could work in our favor.
Florida is a big Second Amendment state.

797
00:49:48,687 --> 00:49:51,337
This is serious. This is not the Player's Ball.

798
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:55,083
You can cut into Lewis' numbers.
Talk about the kids, not about the guns.

799
00:49:55,374 --> 00:49:57,513
If I get shot, everybody is fired.

800
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,175
One question here.

801
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:02,823
There's been an outcry that something
needs to be done about school violence.

802
00:50:02,893 --> 00:50:04,715
What do you plan to do about this?

803
00:50:04,781 --> 00:50:06,788
I feel we need to talk to our kids....

804
00:50:18,476 --> 00:50:19,424
Excuse me.

805
00:50:22,315 --> 00:50:23,624
Hello, children.

806
00:50:24,138 --> 00:50:25,348
Good morning.

807
00:50:27,146 --> 00:50:30,626
Pay attention.
This is going to be a class: Bullshit 101.

808
00:50:30,698 --> 00:50:34,472
Ladies and gentlemen,
our American children are hurting today...

809
00:50:34,857 --> 00:50:37,060
and we need to reach out to them...

810
00:50:37,128 --> 00:50:39,779
and give them all
a good old-fashioned American hug.

811
00:50:41,768 --> 00:50:45,150
America is the greatest country
on the face of the earth...

812
00:50:45,671 --> 00:50:47,045
and I want to say:

813
00:50:47,528 --> 00:50:48,956
God bless America!

814
00:50:49,606 --> 00:50:51,100
And no place else.

815
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:53,310
Thank you. Thank you, children.

816
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:56,000
No more bombs now. And don't use guns.

817
00:50:56,773 --> 00:50:58,715
-That went well.
-Very touching.

818
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:00,578
-The kids liked me.
-You were very genuine.

819
00:51:00,645 --> 00:51:02,172
They responded.

820
00:51:02,245 --> 00:51:05,278
I tried to hug a girl and a boy
so I wouldn't seem sexist.

821
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:07,645
Mr. Vice President!

822
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,115
Welcome to the show, Alderman Gilliam.

823
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,416
Surprised you're not somewhere
with your girlfriend.

824
00:51:12,484 --> 00:51:13,596
How do you know about her?

825
00:51:13,667 --> 00:51:16,122
I'm the government. I know everything.

826
00:51:16,259 --> 00:51:17,666
We really should debate.

827
00:51:19,458 --> 00:51:21,280
Let's get something straight.

828
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:23,996
I don't know you, and I don't like you.

829
00:51:24,834 --> 00:51:28,030
Party's over. I'm fixing to whip your ass.

830
00:51:28,769 --> 00:51:30,111
You got it?

831
00:51:34,145 --> 00:51:35,705
Sir, we really should debate.

832
00:51:37,312 --> 00:51:40,628
God bless America, and no place else.

833
00:51:44,895 --> 00:51:47,448
Sir, we just got this off the uplink.

834
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:48,573
What is it?

835
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:51,355
An off-the-record comment by Mays Gilliam.

836
00:51:51,518 --> 00:51:53,176
-Bad?
-Yes, sir.

837
00:51:53,757 --> 00:51:54,772
Good work.

838
00:52:01,149 --> 00:52:03,188
It's on! Guys, come here!

839
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:06,489
...Lewis was on the scene
comforting parents and students.

840
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:09,626
The press is in Lewis' back pocket.

841
00:52:10,331 --> 00:52:13,943
In this CNB News exclusive,
our cameras caught Gilliam...

842
00:52:14,171 --> 00:52:18,032
making what was arguably
the most controversial statement of the day.

843
00:52:18,266 --> 00:52:21,168
They act like us.
We're bombing countries all the time.

844
00:52:21,242 --> 00:52:23,281
If I was 12, I'd have a gun, too.

845
00:52:23,354 --> 00:52:24,532
Tell me you didn't say that.

846
00:52:24,633 --> 00:52:28,310
I didn't know the camera was on me.
I was playing around with some sound guy.

847
00:52:28,377 --> 00:52:30,613
You didn't know the camera was on you?

848
00:52:31,865 --> 00:52:35,792
Of course it's on you. It's always on you!
You're running for President!

849
00:52:35,864 --> 00:52:36,976
I told you....

850
00:52:37,048 --> 00:52:39,187
This is all your fault!

851
00:52:40,728 --> 00:52:43,826
Gilliam is under investigation by the FBI...

852
00:52:43,895 --> 00:52:45,717
for his involvement with this man...

853
00:52:45,911 --> 00:52:49,358
friend and associate
and accused drug lord, Warren Pryor.

854
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:52,015
-Lord, we're going to jail.
-We're not going to jail.

855
00:52:52,118 --> 00:52:53,132
Is it true?

856
00:52:54,614 --> 00:52:55,726
What's up, Warren?

857
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:58,764
I know him, but I don't drug-lord know him.

858
00:52:58,837 --> 00:53:02,764
It's just a guy I say "What's up?" to.
But I don't know him know him.

859
00:53:02,901 --> 00:53:06,031
Do you have drugs on you?
Get them off, I'm not going to jail for you.

860
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,343
Are you on the pipe?

861
00:53:07,892 --> 00:53:09,866
This is messed up
This really sucks

862
00:53:09,939 --> 00:53:12,208
Every time you're doing good
trouble just pops up

863
00:53:12,275 --> 00:53:14,446
He doesn't know what he's gonna do

864
00:53:16,947 --> 00:53:19,281
This is messed up
This really sucks

865
00:53:19,346 --> 00:53:21,288
Keep your head up, it's your best bet

866
00:53:21,361 --> 00:53:23,401
Let's hope the election's not through

867
00:53:23,474 --> 00:53:27,597
If you see Mays Gilliam,
please do not call the authorities.

868
00:53:27,889 --> 00:53:31,466
Just do whatever you can
to make his life a living hell.

869
00:53:32,176 --> 00:53:33,223
No more questions!

870
00:53:33,296 --> 00:53:36,591
If I see Mays Gilliam,
I'll bust a cap in his ass.

871
00:53:36,656 --> 00:53:41,063
Gilliam is done
and Big Dave says, "Waa-waa!"

872
00:53:41,903 --> 00:53:43,048
Oh, God.

873
00:53:43,919 --> 00:53:45,512
What am I going to do?

874
00:53:46,382 --> 00:53:49,830
What are you worried about?
Your face isn't on the side of a bus.

875
00:53:49,901 --> 00:53:52,006
I'll be the one taking a hit for this.

876
00:53:52,077 --> 00:53:56,452
Get me on the news so I can apologize.
That's what the people want to hear.

877
00:53:56,685 --> 00:53:57,961
You're probably right.

878
00:53:58,029 --> 00:54:00,517
Make a statement of some kind,
try and sound sincere--

879
00:54:00,588 --> 00:54:02,214
Just give me a break!

880
00:54:03,052 --> 00:54:06,150
You think you can say you're sorry
and all of this will go away?

881
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:11,270
Mays, you're running for President
of the United States of America.

882
00:54:12,938 --> 00:54:16,386
Do you have any idea why they chose you?

883
00:54:19,657 --> 00:54:21,926
-We picked you because--
-Shut up!

884
00:54:26,632 --> 00:54:28,901
You're here to lose.

885
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,701
Arnot picked you so you could lose.

886
00:54:33,447 --> 00:54:35,269
Think about it.

887
00:54:35,496 --> 00:54:38,561
If they had any idea
they could win this thing...

888
00:54:38,631 --> 00:54:42,209
do you think they would have chosen
an ignorant-ass nigger like you?

889
00:54:47,206 --> 00:54:48,450
Wait up.

890
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:51,804
You're not calling me an ignorant nigger...

891
00:54:51,909 --> 00:54:54,364
and thinking you're staying on my bus.

892
00:54:55,589 --> 00:54:58,785
I am not getting off this bus.
We're in the middle of nowhere--

893
00:54:58,853 --> 00:55:01,373
Now you need a ride
from an ignorant nigger.

894
00:55:01,444 --> 00:55:03,199
I am not getting off this bus!

895
00:55:03,524 --> 00:55:04,505
Apologize.

896
00:55:05,027 --> 00:55:06,369
Security!

897
00:55:07,683 --> 00:55:09,177
Damn you, Mays Gilliam!

898
00:55:10,915 --> 00:55:12,987
You knew about this all along?

899
00:55:35,295 --> 00:55:37,815
Is there trouble
inside the Gilliam campaign?

900
00:55:37,887 --> 00:55:41,432
That's what Washington insiders
want to know after Gilliam's chief advisor...

901
00:55:41,502 --> 00:55:44,251
Debra Lassiter, left the campaign trail.

902
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:46,684
Down in the polls,
Gilliam still has no running mate.

903
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:49,238
Sources say
the Teamsters may endorse Lewis.

904
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:51,830
Did Gilliam kill JonBenet Ramsay?
Police want to know.

905
00:55:51,901 --> 00:55:54,618
The big question: Where is Mays Gilliam?

906
00:55:55,741 --> 00:55:58,610
I'll tell you where he's at.
He's with his peeps!

907
00:56:03,835 --> 00:56:05,526
-Hello?
-You up?

908
00:56:05,979 --> 00:56:08,696
I was hoping you'd call. Are you okay?

909
00:56:08,795 --> 00:56:11,216
I don't know. I guess I'm all right.

910
00:56:11,803 --> 00:56:13,907
Come on, talk to Mama.

911
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:16,850
I don't know.
It seems like they're trying to get me.

912
00:56:16,921 --> 00:56:19,790
Everywhere I turn,
they're trying to put a foot in my ass.

913
00:56:19,865 --> 00:56:23,094
After what you said,
you need a foot put up in your ass.

914
00:56:23,193 --> 00:56:26,226
What did you expect?
They would just make you President?

915
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,076
They take a poll for everything I do.

916
00:56:29,591 --> 00:56:34,130
You ever been to a horserace?
My dad used to take me when I was little.

917
00:56:34,935 --> 00:56:37,237
The horses wear blinders.

918
00:56:37,911 --> 00:56:41,358
They don't even see each other.
They just run their race.

919
00:56:41,878 --> 00:56:45,139
So don't worry about Lewis,
don't worry about the press...

920
00:56:45,238 --> 00:56:47,180
just run your race.

921
00:56:47,414 --> 00:56:48,940
Let me ask you something.

922
00:56:49,045 --> 00:56:50,027
Okay.

923
00:56:50,613 --> 00:56:52,041
What are you wearing?

924
00:56:52,469 --> 00:56:54,356
Now, you know you need to stop.

925
00:57:01,843 --> 00:57:04,014
Man, news travels fast.

926
00:57:04,371 --> 00:57:08,113
Not 10 minutes after you fired me,
I had two offers for jobs.

927
00:57:08,178 --> 00:57:09,225
Good offers.

928
00:57:09,298 --> 00:57:10,639
What are you doing here?

929
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:14,246
I know you got no reason to trust me,
but I'm asking you to.

930
00:57:14,578 --> 00:57:16,552
You've got five weeks left.

931
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:19,472
I know Lassiter is out, but I think...

932
00:57:20,241 --> 00:57:22,608
I can help you do this.

933
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,265
I want to help you.

934
00:57:26,384 --> 00:57:28,293
And I'm sorry, Mays.

935
00:57:28,847 --> 00:57:30,822
I don't know what else to say...

936
00:57:31,055 --> 00:57:34,121
but as bad as things look,
I don't think you should quit.

937
00:57:35,023 --> 00:57:36,746
Who said I was quitting?

938
00:57:37,198 --> 00:57:38,725
I wish I could quit.

939
00:57:38,894 --> 00:57:40,486
I wish it was that easy.

940
00:57:41,614 --> 00:57:43,075
You're lucky.

941
00:57:43,565 --> 00:57:46,598
You are so lucky.
You don't know how good you got it.

942
00:57:46,861 --> 00:57:48,683
You just represent yourself.

943
00:57:48,748 --> 00:57:49,828
Me?

944
00:57:50,764 --> 00:57:52,738
I represent my whole race.

945
00:57:53,452 --> 00:57:54,826
If I quit...

946
00:57:54,892 --> 00:57:57,990
there won't be another black candidate
for 50 years.

947
00:58:00,011 --> 00:58:01,090
All right.

948
00:58:02,763 --> 00:58:06,439
We can get rid of the school thing
with a statement that will blow things over.

949
00:58:06,602 --> 00:58:07,944
But we need a running mate.

950
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:10,628
Who am I supposed to pick?
Nobody wants to run with me.

951
00:58:10,698 --> 00:58:12,672
We need somebody we can trust.

952
00:58:15,113 --> 00:58:16,454
Who do you trust?

953
00:58:18,441 --> 00:58:20,448
In the midst of his own Cinderella story...

954
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,334
presidential candidate
Gilliam is shaking it up.

955
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:25,985
He's chosen his brother, Mitch Gilliam...

956
00:58:26,056 --> 00:58:29,055
a bail bondsman from Chicago,
as his running mate.

957
00:58:29,479 --> 00:58:32,610
Political analysts say this may be
too little, too late.

958
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:34,718
Hi, I'm with the Pork Commission--

959
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:37,307
I'm from the Athlete's Foot--

960
00:58:38,534 --> 00:58:39,614
Brother!

961
00:58:39,781 --> 00:58:42,236
Can you get my demo tape to somebody--

962
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,477
Are these your bags?

963
00:58:52,547 --> 00:58:55,067
Look at my shoes and at the bags.
Shut up and follow me.

964
00:58:56,995 --> 00:58:58,402
Back up.

965
00:59:04,962 --> 00:59:08,191
What do you have to say about
your brother's controversial comments?

966
00:59:08,354 --> 00:59:11,867
My gosh, lady,
my brother said he was sorry. Let it go.

967
00:59:12,033 --> 00:59:14,106
See, that's why nobody like your ass.

968
00:59:16,033 --> 00:59:18,716
We got work to do.
We way behind in the polls.

969
00:59:18,784 --> 00:59:20,639
-Am I getting paid for this?
-Yeah.

970
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,075
You're running for the vice presidency.
You're a bail bondsman.

971
00:59:25,151 --> 00:59:29,242
You have no Washington experience,
no political experience or connections.

972
00:59:29,311 --> 00:59:33,085
How does being a bail bondsman
qualify you to be Vice President?

973
00:59:33,822 --> 00:59:35,283
I am a bail bondsman.

974
00:59:35,422 --> 00:59:38,007
People come to me when they in trouble,
like the USA.

975
00:59:38,077 --> 00:59:40,565
We bail people out. We bail out Mexico...

976
00:59:40,638 --> 00:59:43,387
the savings and loan, the airline industry.

977
00:59:43,549 --> 00:59:46,745
Now you ask me, sir,
what qualify me to run for Vice President.

978
00:59:46,812 --> 00:59:49,201
When the country is in trouble,
I'll bail them out.

979
00:59:49,276 --> 00:59:51,764
Hold that thought.
We have a caller from Detroit.

980
00:59:51,836 --> 00:59:56,058
Mitch! Why you looking around?
It's Reggie.... Where my money at?

981
00:59:56,123 --> 00:59:58,806
Don't call me with that bullshit!
You see I'm on TV.

982
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:00,402
What about NATO?

983
01:00:00,475 --> 01:00:03,889
I never met Nato.
I don't talk about people behind their back.

984
01:00:03,962 --> 01:00:06,383
NATO is the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.

985
01:00:06,809 --> 01:00:09,656
I thought you were talking about
this guy named Nato.

986
01:00:09,721 --> 01:00:11,630
But you have to know these things.

987
01:00:11,737 --> 01:00:13,744
Do you know Nato Jacobs?

988
01:00:13,913 --> 01:00:16,847
Do you know Nato Jacobs?

989
01:00:17,048 --> 01:00:18,706
I'm sorry, I haven't met the gentleman.

990
01:00:18,776 --> 01:00:20,183
That's what I said.

991
01:00:20,247 --> 01:00:23,313
You know nothing about Nato?
I know nothing about NATO.

992
01:00:23,543 --> 01:00:26,772
Why are you out here
since inmates don't have the right to vote?

993
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:29,588
It's not about the vote.
We're looking out for the convicts.

994
01:00:29,654 --> 01:00:32,556
We want to make sure
when they get out that they stay out.

995
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:36,175
The better the education,
they become more productive citizens.

996
01:00:36,342 --> 01:00:37,803
Mitch! What's up?

997
01:00:37,877 --> 01:00:38,957
Shorty G!

998
01:00:39,029 --> 01:00:40,687
It's good to see you, boy!

999
01:00:40,756 --> 01:00:44,433
This is Shorty G. I arrested his ass.
I thought you got the chair, boy.

1000
01:00:44,533 --> 01:00:47,794
Mr. Gilliam, how would you deal
with white-collar crime?

1001
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:50,505
There's no such thing as white-collar crime.

1002
01:00:50,675 --> 01:00:52,814
And there's no such thing
as black-on-black crime.

1003
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:54,060
Crime is crime.

1004
01:00:54,131 --> 01:00:57,611
I don't care if you have a white collar
or a tank top.

1005
01:00:57,842 --> 01:01:00,395
If you rob me, I'll whup your ass.

1006
01:01:01,906 --> 01:01:05,866
I'm Janet Silvers reporting live in D.C.,
where transit operators....

1007
01:01:05,937 --> 01:01:08,806
-I wish we'd get into the White House.
-To have a cookout?

1008
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,920
They were just talking about your ward.

1009
01:01:10,993 --> 01:01:12,236
What's going on down there?

1010
01:01:12,304 --> 01:01:16,046
They want to cut bus service
until they finish construction. I should go.

1011
01:01:16,111 --> 01:01:18,958
-So you can blow up the bus line?
-One thing at a time.

1012
01:01:19,024 --> 01:01:22,700
The Teamsters haven't endorsed Lewis yet.
Our numbers are going up.

1013
01:01:22,767 --> 01:01:25,963
If we want a real shot at this thing,
we got to get Lewis to debate.

1014
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:27,852
He knows that. That's why he won't.

1015
01:01:27,918 --> 01:01:29,958
He's avoiding me
like he owes me child support.

1016
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:33,029
He is scared. He's holding the ball,
hoping the clock will run out.

1017
01:01:33,101 --> 01:01:35,916
That's a punk move.
Ducking and hiding like a little bitch!

1018
01:01:36,013 --> 01:01:39,361
That may be, but he won't debate you
because you call him a little bitch.

1019
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:44,297
What this community needs--

1020
01:01:44,364 --> 01:01:47,211
Is for you to debate me right now!

1021
01:01:47,275 --> 01:01:48,649
Tell the people that!

1022
01:01:48,715 --> 01:01:51,049
I thought I told you that we won't stop.

1023
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:52,553
Now, my agenda--

1024
01:01:52,619 --> 01:01:54,080
I'll tell you about our agenda.

1025
01:01:54,154 --> 01:01:55,779
It's to have a debate right now!

1026
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:58,403
Get rid of this zero and talk to the hero.

1027
01:02:00,586 --> 01:02:02,724
You got time to jog, but not to debate?

1028
01:02:02,793 --> 01:02:04,222
You can run, but you can't hide.

1029
01:02:04,297 --> 01:02:05,890
I thought I told you we won't stop.

1030
01:02:06,569 --> 01:02:09,384
What you looking for, the news?
The news is we want to debate!

1031
01:02:09,832 --> 01:02:12,287
-Why did you change the channel?
-He's scared!

1032
01:02:13,256 --> 01:02:15,427
-A word from our sponsor.
-We want to debate!

1033
01:02:15,496 --> 01:02:18,529
I thought I told you that we won't stop.

1034
01:02:21,447 --> 01:02:22,526
Yo, Lewis!

1035
01:02:22,694 --> 01:02:26,305
Your mother's ass is so big,
when she sits down she's three feet taller.

1036
01:02:26,822 --> 01:02:29,822
Yo, Lewis!
Your mother's got a really big ass!

1037
01:02:29,894 --> 01:02:32,381
Sir, it's time we prepare for a debate.

1038
01:02:32,453 --> 01:02:35,136
Give me one good reason
I should debate that jerk.

1039
01:02:35,205 --> 01:02:37,725
-He talked about your mother!
-So what?

1040
01:02:38,949 --> 01:02:42,210
Are you going to just let him
talk about me like that?

1041
01:02:46,979 --> 01:02:50,754
After some inventive chiding
on the part of Alderman Mays Gilliam...

1042
01:02:50,819 --> 01:02:54,364
Vice President Lewis
has finally agreed to one debate...

1043
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:56,926
the night before the election.

1044
01:02:58,273 --> 01:03:00,728
So, baby brother, this is it. You ready?

1045
01:03:01,697 --> 01:03:03,191
All right, I guess.

1046
01:03:03,265 --> 01:03:05,948
You guess? You don't know?
You either ready or you ain't.

1047
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,109
What's your problem? I'm ready, okay?

1048
01:03:09,408 --> 01:03:13,302
No, you ain't. Look at you.
If you call this ready, this won't get it.

1049
01:03:13,375 --> 01:03:16,092
Dress for the job you want,
not for the job you got.

1050
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,817
You ain't talking about my clothes.

1051
01:03:17,887 --> 01:03:19,861
Come on now. This ain't about me.

1052
01:03:19,999 --> 01:03:23,610
If I got a good idea, it shouldn't matter
what the hell I'm wearing!

1053
01:03:24,414 --> 01:03:26,170
You know you messed up, man.

1054
01:03:26,878 --> 01:03:28,438
I'm telling you right now.

1055
01:03:28,702 --> 01:03:30,611
You know, this ain't about me!

1056
01:03:33,405 --> 01:03:35,412
Lewis ain't no punk. He ain't no joke.

1057
01:03:35,581 --> 01:03:38,264
That man has been Vice President
for eight years.

1058
01:03:38,652 --> 01:03:41,041
He's a war hero.
He's Sharon Stone's cousin.

1059
01:03:41,116 --> 01:03:42,522
You better come correct.

1060
01:03:43,675 --> 01:03:45,878
Yeah? Well, I got us this far!

1061
01:03:47,355 --> 01:03:49,395
This is as far as you're going to get!

1062
01:03:49,883 --> 01:03:52,272
-It's like that?
-That's the way it is.

1063
01:03:52,378 --> 01:03:54,549
Geller and them up there
pumping your head up.

1064
01:03:54,618 --> 01:03:56,690
But Lewis will smack it back down!

1065
01:04:16,151 --> 01:04:17,558
Oh, my God.

1066
01:04:18,038 --> 01:04:19,664
Little brother, you all right?

1067
01:04:23,446 --> 01:04:25,071
That's what your ass get.

1068
01:04:25,142 --> 01:04:27,924
You need anything?
Because it look like you need some help.

1069
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:30,193
You gonna get yours! I'll tell Ma!

1070
01:04:30,261 --> 01:04:31,471
You better not tell!

1071
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:38,387
Hello?

1072
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:44,751
Don't intrude in my life anymore. I don't
want to have anything to do with you...

1073
01:04:44,819 --> 01:04:46,379
not after the way you treated me.

1074
01:04:46,451 --> 01:04:49,712
I'm sorry I threw you off the bus.
It was wrong.

1075
01:04:49,778 --> 01:04:52,014
I couldn't take what you were saying.

1076
01:04:52,082 --> 01:04:53,325
What do you want?

1077
01:04:54,097 --> 01:04:55,341
I want to win.

1078
01:05:02,927 --> 01:05:06,756
Welcome to New York City
for the 2004 Presidential Debates.

1079
01:05:07,438 --> 01:05:08,453
Where is he?

1080
01:05:08,526 --> 01:05:10,598
He was right behind me.
Should I look for him?

1081
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:12,971
-They're getting nervous.
-We've got to do something.

1082
01:05:13,038 --> 01:05:14,630
-I can do something.
-No!

1083
01:05:15,149 --> 01:05:19,272
Ladies and gentlemen,
Vice President Brian Lewis.

1084
01:05:30,188 --> 01:05:32,260
Wait. Here they come.

1085
01:05:34,571 --> 01:05:35,683
Sweet.

1086
01:05:36,651 --> 01:05:38,112
Hello, Martin.

1087
01:05:38,346 --> 01:05:40,833
Sorry I'm late. I had to change.

1088
01:05:40,906 --> 01:05:43,873
-Mr. Earl, nice to see you.
-Nice to see you too, sir.

1089
01:05:43,978 --> 01:05:45,188
Let's move.

1090
01:05:47,177 --> 01:05:50,689
There are 250 million people out there
deciding who to vote for.

1091
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,727
They all know Lewis
didn't want to debate you. Show them why.

1092
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,582
-Stay focused.
-Take your time.

1093
01:05:56,679 --> 01:05:59,494
If he get out of pocket,
put your foot in his ass.

1094
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:01,345
By the way, nice suit.

1095
01:06:02,886 --> 01:06:04,959
-"Fuh-buh"?
-Fubu.

1096
01:06:05,031 --> 01:06:06,591
Even I knew that.

1097
01:06:08,038 --> 01:06:11,779
Ladies and gentlemen,
Alderman Mays Gilliam.

1098
01:06:23,876 --> 01:06:26,080
Yo, when's Martin coming on, man?

1099
01:06:28,579 --> 01:06:30,586
My momma told me to whup your ass.

1100
01:06:35,619 --> 01:06:40,125
The first question is directed
by coin flip to the Vice President.

1101
01:06:40,706 --> 01:06:42,396
Vice President Lewis...

1102
01:06:42,497 --> 01:06:45,082
what steps should be taken
to limit our youth's access...

1103
01:06:45,153 --> 01:06:46,811
to violent materials?

1104
01:06:46,881 --> 01:06:49,979
Our American children's futures
are at stake here.

1105
01:06:50,592 --> 01:06:54,585
We need to study this issue,
and appropriate legislation...

1106
01:06:54,656 --> 01:06:57,722
that will return us to an America
we can be proud of.

1107
01:06:58,527 --> 01:07:01,047
God bless America, and no place else.

1108
01:07:05,790 --> 01:07:08,855
Alderman Gilliam, same question, please.

1109
01:07:08,925 --> 01:07:11,608
How do we limit violent material? Turn it off.

1110
01:07:11,869 --> 01:07:14,586
And if the kids cut it back on,
knock them out.

1111
01:07:14,685 --> 01:07:16,059
That's why I don't smoke.

1112
01:07:16,125 --> 01:07:18,426
When I was a kid,
my daddy caught me smoking...

1113
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:19,986
and he knocked me out!

1114
01:07:20,156 --> 01:07:23,417
And to this day, I don't smoke.
Not because I'm scared of cancer.

1115
01:07:23,484 --> 01:07:26,832
I don't smoke because I think my dad
is going to walk through that door...

1116
01:07:26,907 --> 01:07:28,849
and knock me the hell out!

1117
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:31,251
Knock out your kids. It helps.

1118
01:07:39,962 --> 01:07:41,522
Vice President Lewis...

1119
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:45,334
with over 10,000 gun deaths per year
in the United States...

1120
01:07:45,848 --> 01:07:48,433
do you believe we need
stricter gun control laws?

1121
01:07:48,536 --> 01:07:50,608
I don't think we need more gun control.

1122
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:53,647
I say we enforce the laws
that are already on the books.

1123
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,437
The problem is, nobody reads the books.

1124
01:07:56,503 --> 01:07:59,404
We need to start putting laws on videos...

1125
01:07:59,479 --> 01:08:02,479
because everybody watches videos,
MTV, BET.

1126
01:08:02,551 --> 01:08:05,005
We need to put some laws
on the Nelly video.

1127
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:09,939
If you had laws on a Destiny's Child video
right now, you could stop crime.

1128
01:08:10,005 --> 01:08:13,420
-We already have gun licensing.
-But that's only to carry the gun.

1129
01:08:13,493 --> 01:08:14,954
Let the people decide.

1130
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:18,475
The people can't decide. The people
are too busy getting shot in the ass.

1131
01:08:37,393 --> 01:08:38,571
That's my brother.

1132
01:08:38,641 --> 01:08:41,259
That's another reason he's not qualified.

1133
01:08:41,393 --> 01:08:44,840
Because I had the good sense to pick
my big brother to be my running mate?

1134
01:08:45,008 --> 01:08:46,982
I didn't come here to argue with you.

1135
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:50,536
Yes, you did. We're having a debate.
A debate ain't nothing but an argument.

1136
01:08:50,607 --> 01:08:52,200
A debate isn't an argument.

1137
01:08:52,368 --> 01:08:54,440
-Yes, it is.
-No, it isn't.

1138
01:08:55,151 --> 01:08:57,256
-Yes, it is.
-No, it isn't.

1139
01:08:57,903 --> 01:08:59,910
I know you are, but what am l?

1140
01:09:06,766 --> 01:09:09,221
Can we just move on? This is ridiculous.

1141
01:09:09,293 --> 01:09:10,570
Our next question comes from--

1142
01:09:10,637 --> 01:09:11,717
I have a question.

1143
01:09:12,301 --> 01:09:15,748
Would you like our reception
to be buffet style or formal seating?

1144
01:09:15,852 --> 01:09:17,794
If you put Robert next to Nelson...

1145
01:09:17,868 --> 01:09:20,835
he'll be very angry
because he wanted to be your best man.

1146
01:09:20,908 --> 01:09:22,663
Security.

1147
01:09:22,732 --> 01:09:24,193
I love you so much--

1148
01:09:25,515 --> 01:09:28,198
The candidates have agreed upon
a short closing speech.

1149
01:09:28,266 --> 01:09:31,233
Vice President Lewis won the coin toss.

1150
01:09:31,306 --> 01:09:32,899
He has elected to go first.

1151
01:09:33,066 --> 01:09:34,276
Thank you.

1152
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:37,184
-No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is!

1153
01:09:37,641 --> 01:09:41,023
Tonight you have seen two different men...

1154
01:09:41,192 --> 01:09:44,836
with two very different points of view,
battle to win your vote.

1155
01:09:45,608 --> 01:09:47,942
And this is what America is all about.

1156
01:09:48,967 --> 01:09:50,690
As we've seen tonight...

1157
01:09:50,824 --> 01:09:55,133
Alderman Gilliam
can be captivating and entertaining.

1158
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:59,324
But America needs more than that
from its Commander in Chief.

1159
01:09:59,686 --> 01:10:02,588
To lead America, it takes experience.

1160
01:10:02,886 --> 01:10:06,147
Now, I've been Vice President
for the last eight years.

1161
01:10:06,757 --> 01:10:10,499
I'm a war hero,
and I'm Sharon Stone's cousin.

1162
01:10:11,844 --> 01:10:15,618
And to me,
America is like a fine performance car.

1163
01:10:16,324 --> 01:10:18,811
And now is not the time...

1164
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:22,081
to turn this fine vehicle we call America...

1165
01:10:22,531 --> 01:10:24,865
over to the hands of an amateur.

1166
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:31,227
I'm Brian Lewis, and I am your last chance.

1167
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:35,161
God bless America, and no place else.

1168
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,389
Yeah, it's over now.

1169
01:10:43,392 --> 01:10:45,180
Why do you have to be so negative?

1170
01:10:46,112 --> 01:10:47,322
Give me five.

1171
01:10:47,392 --> 01:10:48,569
Thank you.

1172
01:10:50,815 --> 01:10:52,091
Hold it!

1173
01:11:03,197 --> 01:11:06,361
You're right, Vice President Lewis.
I am an amateur.

1174
01:11:06,877 --> 01:11:08,949
When it comes to creating
so many enemies...

1175
01:11:09,021 --> 01:11:13,046
that we need billions of dollars
to protect ourselves, I'm an amateur.

1176
01:11:13,148 --> 01:11:15,897
When it comes to paying farmers
not to grow food...

1177
01:11:15,963 --> 01:11:19,279
while people in this country
starve every day, I'm an amateur.

1178
01:11:19,355 --> 01:11:23,348
When it comes to creating a drug policy
that makes crack and heroin...

1179
01:11:23,419 --> 01:11:26,767
cheaper than asthma and AlDS medicine,
I'm an amateur.

1180
01:11:26,842 --> 01:11:29,144
But there's nothing wrong
with being an amateur.

1181
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:32,406
The people that started
the Underground Railroad were amateurs.

1182
01:11:32,473 --> 01:11:34,807
Martin Luther King was an amateur.

1183
01:11:35,193 --> 01:11:37,681
Have you ever been to Amateur Night
at the Apollo?

1184
01:11:37,753 --> 01:11:39,857
Some of the world's best talent was there:

1185
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:44,238
James Brown, Luther Vandross, Rockwell,
the Crown Heights Affair.

1186
01:11:44,312 --> 01:11:47,028
-Hall and Oates!
-The Fat Boys, Rob Base.

1187
01:11:47,095 --> 01:11:49,462
But you wouldn't know
nothing about that. Why?

1188
01:11:49,527 --> 01:11:52,210
Because when it comes to judging
talent and potential...

1189
01:11:52,278 --> 01:11:54,449
you, my friend, are an amateur!

1190
01:11:59,830 --> 01:12:04,084
-I believe the Alderman is over his time.
-You had eight years to talk.

1191
01:12:04,148 --> 01:12:07,279
Now it's my turn. I'm getting mine!

1192
01:12:09,397 --> 01:12:11,785
Ladies and gentlemen,
hold your applause, please.

1193
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:14,478
How can you help the poor
if you never been poor?

1194
01:12:14,548 --> 01:12:17,864
How can you stop crime
if you don't know no criminals?

1195
01:12:17,939 --> 01:12:22,248
How can you make drug policy
if you never smoked a chronic?

1196
01:12:23,187 --> 01:12:25,772
How can you do that? Just a nickel bag!

1197
01:12:26,354 --> 01:12:28,044
I'm a real American.

1198
01:12:28,114 --> 01:12:32,041
I've been high, I've been robbed,
I've been broke.

1199
01:12:32,145 --> 01:12:36,422
My credit is horrible!
They won't even take my cash!

1200
01:12:36,944 --> 01:12:40,904
You're always talking about,
"God bless America, and no place else."

1201
01:12:40,975 --> 01:12:43,626
But isn't it obvious
that God has blessed America?

1202
01:12:43,696 --> 01:12:47,143
America is the richest,
most powerful nation on earth.

1203
01:12:47,535 --> 01:12:51,691
If America was a woman,
it would be a big-titty woman.

1204
01:12:51,758 --> 01:12:54,278
And everybody loves a big-titty woman!

1205
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:56,230
So, in closing...

1206
01:12:56,302 --> 01:12:58,887
I'd like to say you are full of shit.

1207
01:13:00,333 --> 01:13:03,016
"God bless America, and no place else."

1208
01:13:03,085 --> 01:13:06,433
How about "God bless Haiti"
or "God bless Africa"?

1209
01:13:06,508 --> 01:13:08,264
How about "God bless Jamaica"?

1210
01:13:08,332 --> 01:13:11,779
I'm not talking about Jamaica,
the beach tribes you all love.

1211
01:13:11,851 --> 01:13:15,560
I'm talking about stabbing Jamaica.
That's what I'm talking about.

1212
01:13:15,627 --> 01:13:20,329
So, tonight I want to say:
"God bless America, and everybody else!"

1213
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:22,915
The whole world! God bless you!

1214
01:13:22,986 --> 01:13:27,295
I'm Mays Gilliam, and I'm running for
President of the United States of America.

1215
01:13:27,465 --> 01:13:28,643
Ya heard?

1216
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:52,229
Now we can watch Martin!

1217
01:14:04,934 --> 01:14:07,835
-Hello?
-Good morning, Mr. President.

1218
01:14:09,413 --> 01:14:12,576
-What time is it?
-I think it's a little after 7:00.

1219
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:16,249
-Lisa, I need some help in here!
-Will you wait a damn minute?

1220
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:19,645
I was so proud of you.
You were so good last night.

1221
01:14:21,827 --> 01:14:25,983
Tonight, no matter what, win or lose,
I want to see you.

1222
01:14:26,051 --> 01:14:28,189
I don't know. I might have to work.

1223
01:14:28,258 --> 01:14:30,679
But if I don't see you tonight,
I will see you soon.

1224
01:14:30,754 --> 01:14:34,714
Just run your race, get out there,
and do what you got to do, okay?

1225
01:14:34,881 --> 01:14:37,532
-I'll talk to you later. Bye.
-All right.

1226
01:14:38,049 --> 01:14:41,343
It's Election Day, Tuesday,
November 8, 2004.

1227
01:14:41,409 --> 01:14:43,197
The stage is set for what will be...

1228
01:14:43,264 --> 01:14:46,013
one of the most dramatic campaign finales
of all time.

1229
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:49,527
The question everyone's asking is:
"Who will America vote for?"

1230
01:14:50,175 --> 01:14:51,735
I voted for Mays Gilliam.

1231
01:14:51,807 --> 01:14:54,392
-I voted for big business.
-I voted for Lewis.

1232
01:14:54,495 --> 01:14:57,015
Who the fuck you think I'm voting for?

1233
01:14:57,438 --> 01:14:59,161
There seems to be an agreement...

1234
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:02,491
between Washington, D.C., officials
and transit authority operators...

1235
01:15:02,557 --> 01:15:05,142
regarding the shutdown
of the 9th Ward bus line.

1236
01:15:05,212 --> 01:15:07,765
I don't see how they could do this to us.

1237
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:11,032
People got to make money and get to work.

1238
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:16,282
-Show them how you do it.
-The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire

1239
01:15:16,347 --> 01:15:19,446
You're not gonna believe this.
We got the Teamsters!

1240
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:23,092
-That's great, little brother!
-They'll announce it at a press conference.

1241
01:15:23,162 --> 01:15:25,682
You just have to go,
shake hands, take photographs...

1242
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:27,445
but it is yours.

1243
01:15:29,754 --> 01:15:30,834
What's the matter?

1244
01:15:30,905 --> 01:15:34,549
If they shut down this bus service,
I will drive you to work myself.

1245
01:15:35,576 --> 01:15:38,096
-I can't do it.
-But it's Election Day!

1246
01:15:38,168 --> 01:15:40,885
You have to get the endorsement.
You said you want to win.

1247
01:15:40,952 --> 01:15:43,919
You can't snub the Teamsters.
You want them to endorse Lewis?

1248
01:15:43,992 --> 01:15:46,642
I'm not worried about Lewis.
I'm running my race.

1249
01:15:46,711 --> 01:15:49,078
Go ahead, baby brother. I got this.

1250
01:15:50,998 --> 01:15:53,681
-You're just gonna let him go?
-He's a grown man.

1251
01:15:53,751 --> 01:15:57,427
They shut down the whole bus line.
What can he do about that?

1252
01:16:05,909 --> 01:16:10,032
In the latest exit poll, Vice President Lewis
has 51 percent of the vote.

1253
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,725
Bring him back. He got to vote.

1254
01:16:11,795 --> 01:16:15,144
...while Mays Gilliam
is posting an impressive 47 percent.

1255
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:18,379
You gotta get to the back of the bus.

1256
01:16:18,451 --> 01:16:20,142
I'm just playing. Come on.

1257
01:16:20,498 --> 01:16:24,240
Now, he and Vice President Lewis
are in a statistical dead heat.

1258
01:16:24,306 --> 01:16:25,735
Come on, hoes!

1259
01:16:25,841 --> 01:16:29,867
While Lewis and Mitch Gilliam
have been working the campaign trail...

1260
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:33,129
Mays Gilliam has been out
driving people to work.

1261
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,287
Damn it! Why didn't somebody around here
think of this?

1262
01:16:38,352 --> 01:16:40,773
Why am I not out there driving a damn bus?

1263
01:16:40,847 --> 01:16:44,011
Get me an SUV, a minivan, a bus,
a scooter...

1264
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:46,086
a motorcycle, or a rickshaw.

1265
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:47,565
Get me some wheels, bitch!

1266
01:16:48,878 --> 01:16:50,601
Are you going uptown?

1267
01:16:51,822 --> 01:16:53,610
Come on. Wait a minute!

1268
01:16:54,862 --> 01:16:56,901
We could write our own vows!

1269
01:16:57,741 --> 01:17:00,523
I love you, Mays!

1270
01:17:01,901 --> 01:17:05,316
With the polls about 30 minutes
from closing on the East Coast...

1271
01:17:05,389 --> 01:17:08,901
Mays Gilliam is actually ahead
by several points.

1272
01:17:11,404 --> 01:17:13,859
There is no question that Lewis has Texas.

1273
01:17:15,595 --> 01:17:18,759
It seems clear
Gilliam is going to take New York.

1274
01:17:22,954 --> 01:17:23,902
New York!

1275
01:17:23,978 --> 01:17:25,952
It's likely Lewis will take Michigan.

1276
01:17:27,722 --> 01:17:31,496
It looks like Gilliam
might just pull an upset in lllinois.

1277
01:17:33,225 --> 01:17:34,632
Illinois!

1278
01:17:35,592 --> 01:17:36,520
Go, Mays!

1279
01:17:36,584 --> 01:17:39,169
This looks like
it may come down to California.

1280
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,727
This looks like
it may come down to California.

1281
01:17:41,799 --> 01:17:44,188
This looks like
it may come down to California.

1282
01:17:46,055 --> 01:17:49,371
I need to know. How real is this?
Can we win without California?

1283
01:17:49,447 --> 01:17:52,861
We stand a chance if you call
your connections to the energy companies--

1284
01:17:52,933 --> 01:17:55,421
No, you can't win without California.

1285
01:17:55,558 --> 01:17:56,932
What are you doing here?

1286
01:17:56,997 --> 01:18:00,193
Shut up. You want to win,
you'll do what I tell you.

1287
01:18:00,581 --> 01:18:03,362
Gilliam has
over 90 percent minority turnout.

1288
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:07,454
Whites are the majority,
but they're not voting. They don't like you.

1289
01:18:07,747 --> 01:18:09,689
-I like you, sir.
-Shut up.

1290
01:18:10,211 --> 01:18:11,836
How can we turn this around?

1291
01:18:11,907 --> 01:18:15,168
There's about one and a half hours left
at the West Coast polls.

1292
01:18:15,235 --> 01:18:18,846
If there's a leak saying Gilliam
is going to win, you'll get a late rush.

1293
01:18:18,914 --> 01:18:21,597
You get California, you get the election.

1294
01:18:22,593 --> 01:18:27,066
It will make the 6:30 news if we do it now.
We just have to put it out there.

1295
01:18:27,137 --> 01:18:30,267
-Can we do this?
-We're the government. We can do anything.

1296
01:18:31,169 --> 01:18:33,819
The race for President
now turns to the West Coast.

1297
01:18:33,888 --> 01:18:36,757
People, Armageddon is upon us
and Big Dave is scared.

1298
01:18:36,832 --> 01:18:41,087
If these voting trends sustain,
it's likely that for the first time in history...

1299
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:45,045
a black man will become
President of the United States of America.

1300
01:19:19,770 --> 01:19:23,315
"I have a dream that one day...

1301
01:19:25,017 --> 01:19:27,286
"this nation will rise up...

1302
01:19:28,536 --> 01:19:31,351
"and live out the true meaning of its creed:

1303
01:19:32,216 --> 01:19:35,249
"'We hold these truths to be self-evident:

1304
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,716
"'that all men are created equal. "'

1305
01:19:38,647 --> 01:19:39,596
Checkmate.

1306
01:19:39,671 --> 01:19:41,973
I, Richard Nixon, do solemnly swear....

1307
01:19:42,039 --> 01:19:44,144
I, Ronald Reagan, do solemnly swear....

1308
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:52,625
The race for President is over.

1309
01:19:54,101 --> 01:19:55,562
The election is now over.

1310
01:19:55,637 --> 01:19:57,906
-The race for President....
-...is over.

1311
01:20:00,405 --> 01:20:02,347
The race for President is over.

1312
01:20:02,708 --> 01:20:06,602
For the first time in history,
a black man, Mays Gilliam...

1313
01:20:07,316 --> 01:20:10,992
will be the next President
of the United States of America.

1314
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,953
Come here, brother.

1315
01:20:33,488 --> 01:20:35,495
-I love you, man!
-I love you, too.

1316
01:20:44,174 --> 01:20:46,313
I appreciate it. Thanks a lot.

1317
01:20:48,909 --> 01:20:50,186
Thank you.

1318
01:20:52,685 --> 01:20:55,467
We won! Aren't you happy?

1319
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:57,859
-Can I have a massage?
-Yes!

1320
01:20:58,253 --> 01:21:00,041
I won!

1321
01:21:01,804 --> 01:21:05,065
There is no way in the world
I could have ever done this without you.

1322
01:21:05,131 --> 01:21:06,276
You're damn right.

1323
01:21:06,347 --> 01:21:09,249
We won! We did it! Yes!

1324
01:21:11,083 --> 01:21:12,938
Look at my little brother!

1325
01:21:13,003 --> 01:21:16,548
-Boy, I'm proud of you! Mr. President!
-Mr. Vice President.

1326
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:20,926
You're the man! You ain't got to worry about
no assassinations or nothing.

1327
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:23,335
They sure don't want me
to be the next President.

1328
01:21:23,401 --> 01:21:25,506
You can raise taxes, start a war....

1329
01:21:25,577 --> 01:21:27,235
Mays Gilliam began this race....

1330
01:21:27,304 --> 01:21:30,118
That's my man!

1331
01:21:31,976 --> 01:21:33,569
Excuse me, please.

1332
01:21:35,207 --> 01:21:37,574
-I've been looking for you.
-I was looking for you.

1333
01:21:37,639 --> 01:21:40,028
-This is amazing!
-It's amazing.

1334
01:21:40,103 --> 01:21:41,826
It's incredible.

1335
01:21:41,895 --> 01:21:43,902
-What you were up against.
-The odds!

1336
01:21:43,975 --> 01:21:47,203
I can't wait to start working,
and do I have a job for you!

1337
01:21:47,973 --> 01:21:51,682
I don't know what to say. What department
do you want me to work in? Finance?

1338
01:21:51,749 --> 01:21:54,684
No, that's not good enough for you.

1339
01:21:54,757 --> 01:21:57,058
-Foreign Affairs?
-No, not Foreign Affairs.

1340
01:21:57,124 --> 01:22:00,190
I thought you could do
something real good in Security!

1341
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:02,270
You suck!

1342
01:22:07,107 --> 01:22:10,173
We'd like you to run for President.

1343
01:22:10,562 --> 01:22:13,726
Sometimes, you don't know
if people like you for you.

1344
01:22:14,146 --> 01:22:15,836
I like you for you.

1345
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:17,527
Thanks a lot.

1346
01:22:19,873 --> 01:22:22,109
Get your hand off my ass, boy!

1347
01:22:23,584 --> 01:22:24,664
Wait!

1348
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:31,226
Oh, my God, you are everywhere.
Look at you!

1349
01:22:33,695 --> 01:22:36,444
What's the first thing
you're going to do, Mr. President?

1350
01:22:36,511 --> 01:22:39,577
The first thing I'll do
is make you my First Lady.

1351
01:22:40,351 --> 01:22:42,936
-Don't you play with me like that.
-I'm not playing.

1352
01:22:43,006 --> 01:22:44,151
You can't do that!

1353
01:22:44,222 --> 01:22:46,709
I'm the government. I can do anything.

1354
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:03,859
Get ready for...

1355
01:23:03,931 --> 01:23:07,793
the 2005 Presidential Inaugural Ball.

1356
01:23:07,931 --> 01:23:12,437
Ladies and gentlemen, the President
of the United States of America...

1357
01:23:12,506 --> 01:23:16,215
Mays Gilliam, and his future First Wifey...

1358
01:23:16,281 --> 01:23:17,775
Lisa Clark!

1359
01:23:29,463 --> 01:23:31,667
Look at him now, man
Ain't this great

1360
01:23:31,735 --> 01:23:33,807
Biggest man in town
He's the head of state

1361
01:23:33,879 --> 01:23:36,268
They come from all around
just for one handshake

1362
01:23:36,342 --> 01:23:39,408
Look at him now
He's the head of state

1363
01:23:45,333 --> 01:23:48,016
That's me, Mays Gilliam...

1364
01:23:48,117 --> 01:23:50,866
President of the United States of America.

1365
01:23:51,252 --> 01:23:52,597
North America.

1366
01:23:59,443 --> 01:24:01,101
-Who did you vote for?
-For what?

1367
01:24:01,171 --> 01:24:02,633
-For President.
-Of what?

1368
01:24:02,707 --> 01:24:04,975
-Of the United States.
-Of what?

1369
01:24:05,043 --> 01:24:06,701
-Of America.
-What America?

1370
01:24:06,771 --> 01:24:07,850
North America.

1371
01:24:07,922 --> 01:24:10,824
Slick, I don't vote.
You gonna buy some of this meat, or what?

1372
01:24:11,026 --> 01:24:15,335
You can't trust nobody.
Everybody's trying to rob you. Nobody!

1373
01:24:15,441 --> 01:24:17,775
That guy right there! Don't trust him!

1374
01:24:17,841 --> 01:24:19,597
Can't trust no-damn-body!

1375
01:24:19,665 --> 01:24:22,152
America is taking advantage of you!

1376
01:24:22,289 --> 01:24:26,728
You can go to war when you're 18,
but you can't have a drink till you're 21!

1377
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:30,026
-That ain't right!
-Right! So, let me get this straight.

1378
01:24:30,095 --> 01:24:32,299
You're 18 years old. You go to war.

1379
01:24:32,367 --> 01:24:34,701
You come back. Your leg is chopped off!

1380
01:24:34,767 --> 01:24:36,392
You got a damn nub!

1381
01:24:36,462 --> 01:24:38,851
Everywhere you go they say,
"What's up, nubby?"

1382
01:24:38,926 --> 01:24:42,241
You get to the bar and say,
"Bartender, can I have a drink?"

1383
01:24:42,317 --> 01:24:45,862
He looks you up and down and says,
"l got to see some lD."

1384
01:24:45,933 --> 01:24:50,439
ID? You mean to tell me
a one-legged teenager can't have a drink?

1385
01:24:50,604 --> 01:24:54,019
-That ain't right!
-Where is the nub?

1386
01:24:54,124 --> 01:24:58,248
Prescription drugs, I'll lower the prices.
Let me explain something else to you.

1387
01:24:58,316 --> 01:24:59,842
You can survive a stroke...

1388
01:24:59,915 --> 01:25:03,210
but the high prices of medicine
will give you a heart attack.

1389
01:25:03,274 --> 01:25:06,852
America is the richest,
most powerful nation on earth.

1390
01:25:06,954 --> 01:25:10,816
If America was a car, it would be a Bentley...

1391
01:25:10,890 --> 01:25:15,167
sitting on chrome doves,
with TVs in the headrests...

1392
01:25:15,241 --> 01:25:18,557
and a fine, naked Puerto Rican girl
feeding you grapes!

1393
01:25:18,825 --> 01:25:22,239
Ain't nothing better than that!
Ain't nothing ever been better than that!

1394
01:25:22,312 --> 01:25:26,305
Most opponents are saying your brother
destroyed any chance of winning...

1395
01:25:26,375 --> 01:25:28,415
by naming you as his running mate. Why?

1396
01:25:28,487 --> 01:25:31,105
-Why'd your brother make you anchorman?
-I don't have--

1397
01:25:31,175 --> 01:25:34,305
You said it was your brother.
I did my homework as well, okay?

1398
01:25:34,374 --> 01:25:36,381
You got your job same way I got mine.

1399
01:25:36,454 --> 01:25:39,999
-I'm not running for public office.
-I'm not running for anchorman.
