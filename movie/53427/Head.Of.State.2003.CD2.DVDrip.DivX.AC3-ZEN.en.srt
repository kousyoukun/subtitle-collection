1
00:00:00,881 --> 00:00:04,749
The situation is getting tense with the threat
of the bus line being shut down.

2
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:07,754
Protestors took their concerns
to transit officials...

3
00:00:07,822 --> 00:00:11,815
but talks broke down when the newly
appointed alderman, Reginald Shannon...

4
00:00:11,892 --> 00:00:14,622
was punched in the face
by an angry protestor.

5
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:19,563
-Good evening, sir.
-What's up, Nikki?

6
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:23,433
I noticed you weren't at the party,
so I thought...

7
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:28,508
if there is anything you would like
for me to do, I would be happy to.

8
00:00:29,744 --> 00:00:31,234
Could I ask you something?

9
00:00:32,613 --> 00:00:33,807
Yes.

10
00:00:35,116 --> 00:00:37,482
You seem like a nice girl.

11
00:00:39,153 --> 00:00:41,314
How did you get into this line of work?

12
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:49,686
I went to the University of Nebraska...

13
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:52,856
where I majored
in Theater and Communications.

14
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:56,400
I did some extra work,
and a few things that went straight to video.

15
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:01,675
Okay.

16
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:03,870
Can I ask you a question?

17
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:05,172
Yeah, sure.

18
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:09,749
Since I've been here, you haven't really
given me any assignments.

19
00:01:10,818 --> 00:01:13,252
I was wondering if you find me attractive.

20
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,255
I think you're....

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,227
I think you're very attractive. It's just that...

22
00:01:23,297 --> 00:01:27,927
I like to get to know people
before I get involved.

23
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,332
I don't mean to be out of line, sir...

24
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:35,075
but are you?

25
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:39,811
Am I what?

26
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,041
Trying to get to know somebody.

27
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:50,822
-lt is late, I'm out of here.
-You need to take a cab.

28
00:01:51,425 --> 00:01:53,484
I'll be fine. I'm just gonna walk.

29
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:01,494
Take a cab!

30
00:02:02,503 --> 00:02:04,664
I'll be fine. I'll walk.

31
00:02:12,646 --> 00:02:13,772
Need a ride?

32
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:21,745
Where are we going?

33
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:24,221
I just thought I'd give you a little tour.

34
00:02:36,804 --> 00:02:40,240
If you look over there,
it's the Lincoln Memorial.

35
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:43,169
Lincoln freed the slaves...

36
00:02:43,244 --> 00:02:47,078
but before he did it, he said,
"First you niggers got to build me a statue."

37
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:51,584
Right there is the Jefferson Memorial.

38
00:02:51,652 --> 00:02:53,620
Jefferson had a black mistress.

39
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:57,885
He said, "All men are created equal,
but black women got the nicest ass!"

40
00:03:00,227 --> 00:03:01,956
That's the Treasury.

41
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:05,860
If you look real hard in the window,
you can see Oprah counting her money.

42
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:10,928
$20 trillion one, $20 trillion two....

43
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:12,129
Hi, Oprah!

44
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:19,676
What's it like...

45
00:03:19,747 --> 00:03:23,808
traveling all over the country
and meeting all those people?

46
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:28,116
I like it. I like traveling,
I like meeting the people.

47
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:32,558
But sometimes, you don't know
if people like you for you.

48
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,151
-Know what I mean?
-I like you for you.

49
00:03:37,298 --> 00:03:39,198
And I think you're okay.

50
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:41,501
-Just okay?
-I'm just playing.

51
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:46,597
I forgot how nice D.C. was.

52
00:03:48,142 --> 00:03:51,009
I'm always working.
I never get a chance to check it out.

53
00:03:51,078 --> 00:03:54,275
Maybe you need to take advantage
of what's in front of you.

54
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:58,648
You never know, you may look up someday,
and it might not be there.

55
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,482
Freeze!

56
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:08,420
Put your hands up in the air
and step away from Mr. Gilliam!

57
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:09,689
It's okay!

58
00:04:09,897 --> 00:04:12,661
-What the hell are you doing?
-What the hell are you doing?

59
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:16,702
You can't go dashing off
in the middle of the night with some girl.

60
00:04:16,804 --> 00:04:19,432
Something's happened.
We got to pack and get out of here!

61
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:22,041
Somebody make sure she gets home safely.

62
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:24,602
We have a plane waiting for us.

63
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:34,578
In Florida today, guns and explosives
were found at a junior high school.

64
00:04:34,655 --> 00:04:38,591
No one was injured in the incident,
but with just six weeks till Election Day...

65
00:04:38,826 --> 00:04:41,317
this could be a hot-button issue
for both parties.

66
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:44,489
Now, back to the Jay-Z song
already in progress.

67
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:49,332
Muhammad, get me a gun
in case another kid tries to get crazy.

68
00:04:49,436 --> 00:04:53,065
This could work in our favor.
Florida is a big Second Amendment state.

69
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:55,869
This is serious. This is not the Player's Ball.

70
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:59,810
You can cut into Lewis' numbers.
Talk about the kids, not about the guns.

71
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,310
If I get shot, everybody is fired.

72
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,044
One question here.

73
00:05:04,118 --> 00:05:07,849
There's been an outcry that something
needs to be done about school violence.

74
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:09,821
What do you plan to do about this?

75
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,983
I feel we need to talk to our kids....

76
00:05:24,204 --> 00:05:25,171
Excuse me.

77
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,573
Hello, children.

78
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,372
Good morning.

79
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:36,876
Pay attention.
This is going to be a class: Bullshit 101.

80
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,886
Ladies and gentlemen,
our American children are hurting today...

81
00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:43,586
and we need to reach out to them...

82
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:46,421
and give them all
a good old-fashioned American hug.

83
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:52,022
America is the greatest country
on the face of the earth...

84
00:05:52,566 --> 00:05:53,999
and I want to say:

85
00:05:54,468 --> 00:05:55,935
God bless America!

86
00:05:56,637 --> 00:05:58,161
And no place else.

87
00:05:58,372 --> 00:06:00,465
Thank you. Thank you, children.

88
00:06:00,574 --> 00:06:03,304
No more bombs now. And don't use guns.

89
00:06:04,111 --> 00:06:06,136
-That went well.
-Very touching.

90
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:08,078
-The kids liked me.
-You were very genuine.

91
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:09,740
They responded.

92
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:12,980
I tried to hug a girl and a boy
so I wouldn't seem sexist.

93
00:06:13,754 --> 00:06:15,449
Mr. Vice President!

94
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,024
Welcome to the show, Alderman Gilliam.

95
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:20,424
Surprised you're not somewhere
with your girlfriend.

96
00:06:20,494 --> 00:06:21,654
How do you know about her?

97
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:24,289
I'm the government. I know everything.

98
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:25,898
We really should debate.

99
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:29,701
Let's get something straight.

100
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:32,499
I don't know you, and I don't like you.

101
00:06:33,407 --> 00:06:36,740
Party's over. I'm fixing to whip your ass.

102
00:06:37,511 --> 00:06:38,910
You got it?

103
00:06:43,117 --> 00:06:44,744
Sir, we really should debate.

104
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,878
God bless America, and no place else.

105
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:56,923
Sir, we just got this off the uplink.

106
00:06:57,164 --> 00:06:58,096
What is it?

107
00:06:58,165 --> 00:07:00,998
An off-the-record comment by Mays Gilliam.

108
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:02,896
-Bad?
-Yes, sir.

109
00:07:03,537 --> 00:07:04,561
Good work.

110
00:07:11,245 --> 00:07:13,372
It's on! Guys, come here!

111
00:07:13,447 --> 00:07:16,814
...Lewis was on the scene
comforting parents and students.

112
00:07:17,651 --> 00:07:20,085
The press is in Lewis' back pocket.

113
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:24,587
In this CNB News exclusive,
our cameras caught Gilliam...

114
00:07:24,825 --> 00:07:28,852
making what was arguably
the most controversial statement of the day.

115
00:07:29,096 --> 00:07:32,122
They act like us.
We're bombing countries all the time.

116
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:34,326
If I was 12, I'd have a gun, too.

117
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:35,629
Tell me you didn't say that.

118
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:39,603
I didn't know the camera was on me.
I was playing around with some sound guy.

119
00:07:39,673 --> 00:07:42,005
You didn't know the camera was on you?

120
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:47,406
Of course it's on you. It's always on you!
You're running for President!

121
00:07:47,481 --> 00:07:48,641
I told you....

122
00:07:48,715 --> 00:07:50,945
This is all your fault!

123
00:07:52,553 --> 00:07:55,716
Gilliam is under investigation by the FBI...

124
00:07:55,823 --> 00:07:57,723
for his involvement with this man...

125
00:07:57,891 --> 00:08:01,486
friend and associate
and accused drug lord, Warren Pryor.

126
00:08:01,562 --> 00:08:04,258
-Lord, we're going to jail.
-We're not going to jail.

127
00:08:04,364 --> 00:08:05,422
Is it true?

128
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:08,127
What's up, Warren?

129
00:08:08,202 --> 00:08:11,296
I know him, but I don't drug-lord know him.

130
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:15,466
It's just a guy I say "What's up?" to.
But I don't know him know him.

131
00:08:15,642 --> 00:08:18,907
Do you have drugs on you?
Get them off, I'm not going to jail for you.

132
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:20,276
Are you on the pipe?

133
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:22,907
This is messed up
This really sucks

134
00:08:22,983 --> 00:08:25,349
Every time you're doing good
trouble just pops up

135
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:27,683
He doesn't know what he's gonna do

136
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,724
This is messed up
This really sucks

137
00:08:32,793 --> 00:08:34,818
Keep your head up, it's your best bet

138
00:08:34,895 --> 00:08:37,022
Let's hope the election's not through

139
00:08:37,097 --> 00:08:41,397
If you see Mays Gilliam,
please do not call the authorities.

140
00:08:41,702 --> 00:08:45,433
Just do whatever you can
to make his life a living hell.

141
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:47,264
No more questions!

142
00:08:47,374 --> 00:08:50,810
If I see Mays Gilliam,
I'll bust a cap in his ass.

143
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:55,406
Gilliam is done
and Big Dave says, "Waa-waa!"

144
00:08:56,283 --> 00:08:57,477
Oh, God.

145
00:08:58,385 --> 00:09:00,046
What am I going to do?

146
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:04,549
What are you worried about?
Your face isn't on the side of a bus.

147
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,820
I'll be the one taking a hit for this.

148
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:11,456
Get me on the news so I can apologize.
That's what the people want to hear.

149
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:13,029
You're probably right.

150
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,694
Make a statement of some kind,
try and sound sincere--

151
00:09:15,802 --> 00:09:17,463
Just give me a break!

152
00:09:18,372 --> 00:09:21,603
You think you can say you're sorry
and all of this will go away?

153
00:09:22,676 --> 00:09:26,942
Mays, you're running for President
of the United States of America.

154
00:09:28,682 --> 00:09:32,277
Do you have any idea why they chose you?

155
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:38,055
-We picked you because--
-Shut up!

156
00:09:42,963 --> 00:09:45,329
You're here to lose.

157
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:49,292
Arnot picked you so you could lose.

158
00:09:50,103 --> 00:09:52,003
Think about it.

159
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:55,367
If they had any idea
they could win this thing...

160
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:59,206
do you think they would have chosen
an ignorant-ass nigger like you?

161
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:05,681
Wait up.

162
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:09,179
You're not calling me an ignorant nigger...

163
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:11,849
and thinking you're staying on my bus.

164
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:16,459
I am not getting off this bus.
We're in the middle of nowhere--

165
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,158
Now you need a ride
from an ignorant nigger.

166
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:21,063
I am not getting off this bus!

167
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:22,425
Apologize.

168
00:10:23,003 --> 00:10:24,402
Security!

169
00:10:25,772 --> 00:10:27,296
Damn you, Mays Gilliam!

170
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:31,303
You knew about this all along?

171
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:57,129
Is there trouble
inside the Gilliam campaign?

172
00:10:57,237 --> 00:11:00,900
That's what Washington insiders
want to know after Gilliam's chief advisor...

173
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:03,875
Debra Lassiter, left the campaign trail.

174
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:06,411
Down in the polls,
Gilliam still has no running mate.

175
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,074
Sources say
the Teamsters may endorse Lewis.

176
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:11,777
Did Gilliam kill JonBenet Ramsay?
Police want to know.

177
00:11:11,852 --> 00:11:14,685
The big question: Where is Mays Gilliam?

178
00:11:15,856 --> 00:11:18,848
I'll tell you where he's at.
He's with his peeps!

179
00:11:24,297 --> 00:11:26,060
-Hello?
-You up?

180
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:29,366
I was hoping you'd call. Are you okay?

181
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:31,994
I don't know. I guess I'm all right.

182
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,800
Come on, talk to Mama.

183
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:37,903
I don't know.
It seems like they're trying to get me.

184
00:11:37,978 --> 00:11:40,970
Everywhere I turn,
they're trying to put a foot in my ass.

185
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:44,415
After what you said,
you need a foot put up in your ass.

186
00:11:44,518 --> 00:11:47,681
What did you expect?
They would just make you President?

187
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:50,653
They take a poll for everything I do.

188
00:11:51,191 --> 00:11:55,855
You ever been to a horserace?
My dad used to take me when I was little.

189
00:11:56,697 --> 00:11:59,097
The horses wear blinders.

190
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,395
They don't even see each other.
They just run their race.

191
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,371
So don't worry about Lewis,
don't worry about the press...

192
00:12:07,474 --> 00:12:09,465
just run your race.

193
00:12:09,743 --> 00:12:11,335
Let me ask you something.

194
00:12:11,445 --> 00:12:12,434
Okay.

195
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,570
What are you wearing?

196
00:12:15,015 --> 00:12:16,983
Now, you know you need to stop.

197
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,055
Man, news travels fast.

198
00:12:27,427 --> 00:12:31,329
Not 10 minutes after you fired me,
I had two offers for jobs.

199
00:12:31,398 --> 00:12:32,490
Good offers.

200
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:33,965
What are you doing here?

201
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:37,725
I know you got no reason to trust me,
but I'm asking you to.

202
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:40,130
You've got five weeks left.

203
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,209
I know Lassiter is out, but I think...

204
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,478
I can help you do this.

205
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:48,207
I want to help you.

206
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:52,408
And I'm sorry, Mays.

207
00:12:52,986 --> 00:12:55,045
I don't know what else to say...

208
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:58,485
but as bad as things look,
I don't think you should quit.

209
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:01,223
Who said I was quitting?

210
00:13:01,695 --> 00:13:03,287
I wish I could quit.

211
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:05,124
I wish it was that easy.

212
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:07,823
You're lucky.

213
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:11,498
You are so lucky.
You don't know how good you got it.

214
00:13:11,805 --> 00:13:13,705
You just represent yourself.

215
00:13:13,774 --> 00:13:14,866
Me?

216
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:17,901
I represent my whole race.

217
00:13:18,678 --> 00:13:20,111
If I quit...

218
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,411
there won't be another black candidate
for 50 years.

219
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,645
All right.

220
00:13:28,388 --> 00:13:32,222
We can get rid of the school thing
with a statement that will blow things over.

221
00:13:32,392 --> 00:13:33,791
But we need a running mate.

222
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,590
Who am I supposed to pick?
Nobody wants to run with me.

223
00:13:36,663 --> 00:13:38,722
We need somebody we can trust.

224
00:13:41,268 --> 00:13:42,667
Who do you trust?

225
00:13:44,771 --> 00:13:46,830
In the midst of his own Cinderella story...

226
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,875
presidential candidate
Gilliam is shaking it up.

227
00:13:49,943 --> 00:13:52,639
He's chosen his brother, Mitch Gilliam...

228
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:55,772
a bail bondsman from Chicago,
as his running mate.

229
00:13:56,216 --> 00:13:59,481
Political analysts say this may be
too little, too late.

230
00:13:59,553 --> 00:14:01,680
Hi, I'm with the Pork Commission--

231
00:14:01,855 --> 00:14:04,380
I'm from the Athlete's Foot--

232
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:06,785
Brother!

233
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,520
Can you get my demo tape to somebody--

234
00:14:19,005 --> 00:14:20,199
Are these your bags?

235
00:14:20,307 --> 00:14:22,901
Look at my shoes and at the bags.
Shut up and follow me.

236
00:14:24,945 --> 00:14:26,412
Back up.

237
00:14:33,253 --> 00:14:36,620
What do you have to say about
your brother's controversial comments?

238
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,453
My gosh, lady,
my brother said he was sorry. Let it go.

239
00:14:40,627 --> 00:14:42,788
See, that's why nobody like your ass.

240
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:47,596
We got work to do.
We way behind in the polls.

241
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:49,601
-Am I getting paid for this?
-Yeah.

242
00:14:50,804 --> 00:14:54,171
You're running for the vice presidency.
You're a bail bondsman.

243
00:14:54,274 --> 00:14:58,540
You have no Washington experience,
no political experience or connections.

244
00:14:58,612 --> 00:15:02,548
How does being a bail bondsman
qualify you to be Vice President?

245
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:04,840
I am a bail bondsman.

246
00:15:04,985 --> 00:15:07,681
People come to me when they in trouble,
like the USA.

247
00:15:07,754 --> 00:15:10,348
We bail people out. We bail out Mexico...

248
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:13,290
the savings and loan, the airline industry.

249
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,793
Now you ask me, sir,
what qualify me to run for Vice President.

250
00:15:16,863 --> 00:15:19,354
When the country is in trouble,
I'll bail them out.

251
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:22,026
Hold that thought.
We have a caller from Detroit.

252
00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:26,539
Mitch! Why you looking around?
It's Reggie.... Where my money at?

253
00:15:26,606 --> 00:15:29,404
Don't call me with that bullshit!
You see I'm on TV.

254
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:31,034
What about NATO?

255
00:15:31,144 --> 00:15:34,705
I never met Nato.
I don't talk about people behind their back.

256
00:15:34,781 --> 00:15:37,306
NATO is the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.

257
00:15:37,751 --> 00:15:40,720
I thought you were talking about
this guy named Nato.

258
00:15:40,787 --> 00:15:42,778
But you have to know these things.

259
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:44,982
Do you know Nato Jacobs?

260
00:15:45,158 --> 00:15:48,218
Do you know Nato Jacobs?

261
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:50,157
I'm sorry, I haven't met the gentleman.

262
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,697
That's what I said.

263
00:15:51,765 --> 00:15:54,893
You know nothing about Nato?
I know nothing about NATO.

264
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:58,502
Why are you out here
since inmates don't have the right to vote?

265
00:15:58,605 --> 00:16:01,472
It's not about the vote.
We're looking out for the convicts.

266
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:04,533
We want to make sure
when they get out that they stay out.

267
00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:08,341
The better the education,
they become more productive citizens.

268
00:16:08,515 --> 00:16:10,039
Mitch! What's up?

269
00:16:10,116 --> 00:16:11,242
Shorty G!

270
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:13,047
It's good to see you, boy!

271
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:16,953
This is Shorty G. I arrested his ass.
I thought you got the chair, boy.

272
00:16:17,057 --> 00:16:20,458
Mr. Gilliam, how would you deal
with white-collar crime?

273
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,285
There's no such thing as white-collar crime.

274
00:16:23,463 --> 00:16:25,693
And there's no such thing
as black-on-black crime.

275
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:26,993
Crime is crime.

276
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:30,696
I don't care if you have a white collar
or a tank top.

277
00:16:30,971 --> 00:16:33,599
If you rob me, I'll whup your ass.

278
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:39,338
I'm Janet Silvers reporting live in D.C.,
where transit operators....

279
00:16:39,412 --> 00:16:42,404
-I wish we'd get into the White House.
-To have a cookout?

280
00:16:42,482 --> 00:16:44,609
They were just talking about your ward.

281
00:16:44,684 --> 00:16:45,981
What's going on down there?

282
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:49,954
They want to cut bus service
until they finish construction. I should go.

283
00:16:50,023 --> 00:16:52,992
-So you can blow up the bus line?
-One thing at a time.

284
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:56,825
The Teamsters haven't endorsed Lewis yet.
Our numbers are going up.

285
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:00,263
If we want a real shot at this thing,
we got to get Lewis to debate.

286
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,200
He knows that. That's why he won't.

287
00:17:02,268 --> 00:17:04,395
He's avoiding me
like he owes me child support.

288
00:17:04,471 --> 00:17:07,599
He is scared. He's holding the ball,
hoping the clock will run out.

289
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:10,642
That's a punk move.
Ducking and hiding like a little bitch!

290
00:17:10,744 --> 00:17:14,202
That may be, but he won't debate you
because you call him a little bitch.

291
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,382
What this community needs--

292
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:22,421
Is for you to debate me right now!

293
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:23,922
Tell the people that!

294
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,424
I thought I told you that we won't stop.

295
00:17:26,593 --> 00:17:27,992
Now, my agenda--

296
00:17:28,061 --> 00:17:29,585
I'll tell you about our agenda.

297
00:17:29,662 --> 00:17:31,357
It's to have a debate right now!

298
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:34,093
Get rid of this zero and talk to the hero.

299
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:38,599
You got time to jog, but not to debate?

300
00:17:38,705 --> 00:17:40,172
You can run, but you can't hide.

301
00:17:40,273 --> 00:17:41,900
I thought I told you we won't stop.

302
00:17:42,642 --> 00:17:45,577
What you looking for, the news?
The news is we want to debate!

303
00:17:46,046 --> 00:17:48,606
-Why did you change the channel?
-He's scared!

304
00:17:49,616 --> 00:17:51,880
-A word from our sponsor.
-We want to debate!

305
00:17:51,951 --> 00:17:55,045
I thought I told you that we won't stop.

306
00:17:58,091 --> 00:17:59,217
Yo, Lewis!

307
00:17:59,392 --> 00:18:03,158
Your mother's ass is so big,
when she sits down she's three feet taller.

308
00:18:03,696 --> 00:18:06,824
Yo, Lewis!
Your mother's got a really big ass!

309
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,494
Sir, it's time we prepare for a debate.

310
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:12,367
Give me one good reason
I should debate that jerk.

311
00:18:12,472 --> 00:18:15,066
-He talked about your mother!
-So what?

312
00:18:16,376 --> 00:18:19,777
Are you going to just let him
talk about me like that?

313
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:28,687
After some inventive chiding
on the part of Alderman Mays Gilliam...

314
00:18:28,755 --> 00:18:32,452
Vice President Lewis
has finally agreed to one debate...

315
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:35,124
the night before the election.

316
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:39,089
So, baby brother, this is it. You ready?

317
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,658
All right, I guess.

318
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:44,532
You guess? You don't know?
You either ready or you ain't.

319
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:47,839
What's your problem? I'm ready, okay?

320
00:18:48,174 --> 00:18:52,201
No, you ain't. Look at you.
If you call this ready, this won't get it.

321
00:18:52,312 --> 00:18:55,076
Dress for the job you want,
not for the job you got.

322
00:18:55,181 --> 00:18:56,910
You ain't talking about my clothes.

323
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,009
Come on now. This ain't about me.

324
00:18:59,152 --> 00:19:02,918
If I got a good idea, it shouldn't matter
what the hell I'm wearing!

325
00:19:03,756 --> 00:19:05,587
You know you messed up, man.

326
00:19:06,326 --> 00:19:07,953
I'm telling you right now.

327
00:19:08,228 --> 00:19:10,219
You know, this ain't about me!

328
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:15,226
Lewis ain't no punk. He ain't no joke.

329
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:18,199
That man has been Vice President
for eight years.

330
00:19:18,638 --> 00:19:21,106
He's a war hero.
He's Sharon Stone's cousin.

331
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:22,674
You better come correct.

332
00:19:23,877 --> 00:19:26,175
Yeah? Well, I got us this far!

333
00:19:27,714 --> 00:19:29,841
This is as far as you're going to get!

334
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,841
-It's like that?
-That's the way it is.

335
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:35,216
Geller and them up there
pumping your head up.

336
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:37,449
But Lewis will smack it back down!

337
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,177
Oh, my God.

338
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,374
Little brother, you all right?

339
00:20:05,318 --> 00:20:07,013
That's what your ass get.

340
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:09,987
You need anything?
Because it look like you need some help.

341
00:20:10,056 --> 00:20:12,354
You gonna get yours! I'll tell Ma!

342
00:20:12,425 --> 00:20:13,687
You better not tell!

343
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:20,900
Hello?

344
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:27,536
Don't intrude in my life anymore. I don't
want to have anything to do with you...

345
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,232
not after the way you treated me.

346
00:20:29,342 --> 00:20:32,743
I'm sorry I threw you off the bus.
It was wrong.

347
00:20:32,812 --> 00:20:35,144
I couldn't take what you were saying.

348
00:20:35,215 --> 00:20:36,512
What do you want?

349
00:20:37,317 --> 00:20:38,614
I want to win.

350
00:20:46,526 --> 00:20:50,519
Welcome to New York City
for the 2004 Presidential Debates.

351
00:20:51,231 --> 00:20:52,289
Where is he?

352
00:20:52,365 --> 00:20:54,458
He was right behind me.
Should I look for him?

353
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:56,967
-They're getting nervous.
-We've got to do something.

354
00:20:57,003 --> 00:20:58,664
-I can do something.
-No!

355
00:20:59,205 --> 00:21:03,505
Ladies and gentlemen,
Vice President Brian Lewis.

356
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:17,082
Wait. Here they come.

357
00:21:19,492 --> 00:21:20,652
Sweet.

358
00:21:21,661 --> 00:21:23,185
Hello, Martin.

359
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:26,023
Sorry I'm late. I had to change.

360
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:29,193
-Mr. Earl, nice to see you.
-Nice to see you too, sir.

361
00:21:29,302 --> 00:21:30,564
Let's move.

362
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:36,302
There are 250 million people out there
deciding who to vote for.

363
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:39,469
They all know Lewis
didn't want to debate you. Show them why.

364
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:42,480
-Stay focused.
-Take your time.

365
00:21:42,582 --> 00:21:45,517
If he get out of pocket,
put your foot in his ass.

366
00:21:45,685 --> 00:21:47,448
By the way, nice suit.

367
00:21:49,055 --> 00:21:51,216
-"Fuh-buh"?
-Fubu.

368
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,918
Even I knew that.

369
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,262
Ladies and gentlemen,
Alderman Mays Gilliam.

370
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,208
Yo, when's Martin coming on, man?

371
00:22:15,815 --> 00:22:17,908
My momma told me to whup your ass.

372
00:22:23,156 --> 00:22:27,855
The first question is directed
by coin flip to the Vice President.

373
00:22:28,461 --> 00:22:30,224
Vice President Lewis...

374
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,026
what steps should be taken
to limit our youth's access...

375
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:34,828
to violent materials?

376
00:22:34,901 --> 00:22:38,132
Our American children's futures
are at stake here.

377
00:22:38,771 --> 00:22:42,935
We need to study this issue,
and appropriate legislation...

378
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:46,239
that will return us to an America
we can be proud of.

379
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,708
God bless America, and no place else.

380
00:22:54,654 --> 00:22:57,851
Alderman Gilliam, same question, please.

381
00:22:57,924 --> 00:23:00,722
How do we limit violent material? Turn it off.

382
00:23:00,993 --> 00:23:03,826
And if the kids cut it back on,
knock them out.

383
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,363
That's why I don't smoke.

384
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:07,831
When I was a kid,
my daddy caught me smoking...

385
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,458
and he knocked me out!

386
00:23:09,635 --> 00:23:13,036
And to this day, I don't smoke.
Not because I'm scared of cancer.

387
00:23:13,106 --> 00:23:16,598
I don't smoke because I think my dad
is going to walk through that door...

388
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:18,700
and knock me the hell out!

389
00:23:19,112 --> 00:23:21,239
Knock out your kids. It helps.

390
00:23:30,323 --> 00:23:31,950
Vice President Lewis...

391
00:23:32,058 --> 00:23:35,926
with over 10,000 gun deaths per year
in the United States...

392
00:23:36,462 --> 00:23:39,158
do you believe we need
stricter gun control laws?

393
00:23:39,265 --> 00:23:41,426
I don't think we need more gun control.

394
00:23:41,501 --> 00:23:44,595
I say we enforce the laws
that are already on the books.

395
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,503
The problem is, nobody reads the books.

396
00:23:47,607 --> 00:23:50,599
We need to start putting laws on videos...

397
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,804
because everybody watches videos,
MTV, BET.

398
00:23:53,913 --> 00:23:56,404
We need to put some laws
on the Nelly video.

399
00:23:56,682 --> 00:24:01,551
If you had laws on a Destiny's Child video
right now, you could stop crime.

400
00:24:01,621 --> 00:24:05,182
-We already have gun licensing.
-But that's only to carry the gun.

401
00:24:05,258 --> 00:24:06,782
Let the people decide.

402
00:24:06,893 --> 00:24:10,454
The people can't decide. The people
are too busy getting shot in the ass.

403
00:24:30,216 --> 00:24:31,444
That's my brother.

404
00:24:31,517 --> 00:24:34,247
That's another reason he's not qualified.

405
00:24:34,387 --> 00:24:37,982
Because I had the good sense to pick
my big brother to be my running mate?

406
00:24:38,157 --> 00:24:40,216
I didn't come here to argue with you.

407
00:24:40,293 --> 00:24:43,922
Yes, you did. We're having a debate.
A debate ain't nothing but an argument.

408
00:24:43,996 --> 00:24:45,657
A debate isn't an argument.

409
00:24:45,832 --> 00:24:47,993
-Yes, it is.
-No, it isn't.

410
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:50,929
-Yes, it is.
-No, it isn't.

411
00:24:51,604 --> 00:24:53,697
I know you are, but what am l?

412
00:25:00,813 --> 00:25:03,373
Can we just move on? This is ridiculous.

413
00:25:03,449 --> 00:25:04,780
Our next question comes from--

414
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:05,977
I have a question.

415
00:25:06,586 --> 00:25:10,181
Would you like our reception
to be buffet style or formal seating?

416
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:12,314
If you put Robert next to Nelson...

417
00:25:12,391 --> 00:25:15,485
he'll be very angry
because he wanted to be your best man.

418
00:25:15,561 --> 00:25:17,392
Security.

419
00:25:17,463 --> 00:25:18,987
I love you so much--

420
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:23,164
The candidates have agreed upon
a short closing speech.

421
00:25:23,236 --> 00:25:26,330
Vice President Lewis won the coin toss.

422
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:28,066
He has elected to go first.

423
00:25:28,274 --> 00:25:29,502
Thank you.

424
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,535
-No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is!

425
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:36,537
Tonight you have seen two different men...

426
00:25:36,749 --> 00:25:40,549
with two very different points of view,
battle to win your vote.

427
00:25:41,354 --> 00:25:43,788
And this is what America is all about.

428
00:25:44,857 --> 00:25:46,654
As we've seen tonight...

429
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:51,286
Alderman Gilliam
can be captivating and entertaining.

430
00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:55,589
But America needs more than that
from its Commander in Chief.

431
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,994
To lead America, it takes experience.

432
00:25:59,305 --> 00:26:02,741
Now, I've been Vice President
for the last eight years.

433
00:26:03,376 --> 00:26:07,278
I'm a war hero,
and I'm Sharon Stone's cousin.

434
00:26:08,681 --> 00:26:12,617
And to me,
America is like a fine performance car.

435
00:26:13,352 --> 00:26:15,946
And now is not the time...

436
00:26:16,455 --> 00:26:19,356
to turn this fine vehicle we call America...

437
00:26:19,825 --> 00:26:22,259
over to the hands of an amateur.

438
00:26:25,197 --> 00:26:28,894
I'm Brian Lewis, and I am your last chance.

439
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:32,996
God bless America, and no place else.

440
00:26:38,077 --> 00:26:40,545
Yeah, it's over now.

441
00:26:41,614 --> 00:26:43,479
Why do you have to be so negative?

442
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:45,712
Give me five.

443
00:26:45,785 --> 00:26:47,013
Thank you.

444
00:26:49,355 --> 00:26:50,686
Hold it!

445
00:27:02,201 --> 00:27:05,500
You're right, Vice President Lewis.
I am an amateur.

446
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:08,199
When it comes to creating
so many enemies...

447
00:27:08,307 --> 00:27:12,471
that we need billions of dollars
to protect ourselves, I'm an amateur.

448
00:27:12,612 --> 00:27:15,479
When it comes to paying farmers
not to grow food...

449
00:27:15,548 --> 00:27:18,984
while people in this country
starve every day, I'm an amateur.

450
00:27:19,085 --> 00:27:23,249
When it comes to creating a drug policy
that makes crack and heroin...

451
00:27:23,322 --> 00:27:26,814
cheaper than asthma and AlDS medicine,
I'm an amateur.

452
00:27:26,892 --> 00:27:29,292
But there's nothing wrong
with being an amateur.

453
00:27:29,362 --> 00:27:32,695
The people that started
the Underground Railroad were amateurs.

454
00:27:32,765 --> 00:27:35,199
Martin Luther King was an amateur.

455
00:27:35,601 --> 00:27:38,195
Have you ever been to Amateur Night
at the Apollo?

456
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,465
Some of the world's best talent was there:

457
00:27:40,573 --> 00:27:45,033
James Brown, Luther Vandross, Rockwell,
the Crown Heights Affair.

458
00:27:45,144 --> 00:27:47,977
-Hall and Oates!
-The Fat Boys, Rob Base.

459
00:27:48,047 --> 00:27:50,515
But you wouldn't know
nothing about that. Why?

460
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:53,381
Because when it comes to judging
talent and potential...

461
00:27:53,452 --> 00:27:55,647
you, my friend, are an amateur!

462
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,697
-I believe the Alderman is over his time.
-You had eight years to talk.

463
00:28:05,765 --> 00:28:09,030
Now it's my turn. I'm getting mine!

464
00:28:11,237 --> 00:28:13,728
Ladies and gentlemen,
hold your applause, please.

465
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:16,535
How can you help the poor
if you never been poor?

466
00:28:16,642 --> 00:28:20,078
How can you stop crime
if you don't know no criminals?

467
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:24,673
How can you make drug policy
if you never smoked a chronic?

468
00:28:25,651 --> 00:28:28,347
How can you do that? Just a nickel bag!

469
00:28:28,954 --> 00:28:30,717
I'm a real American.

470
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:34,886
I've been high, I've been robbed,
I've been broke.

471
00:28:34,994 --> 00:28:39,454
My credit is horrible!
They won't even take my cash!

472
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:44,129
You're always talking about,
"God bless America, and no place else."

473
00:28:44,203 --> 00:28:46,967
But isn't it obvious
that God has blessed America?

474
00:28:47,073 --> 00:28:50,634
America is the richest,
most powerful nation on earth.

475
00:28:51,077 --> 00:28:55,343
If America was a woman,
it would be a big-titty woman.

476
00:28:55,448 --> 00:28:58,076
And everybody loves a big-titty woman!

477
00:28:58,451 --> 00:29:00,078
So, in closing...

478
00:29:00,152 --> 00:29:02,848
I'd like to say you are full of shit.

479
00:29:04,356 --> 00:29:07,154
"God bless America, and no place else."

480
00:29:07,226 --> 00:29:10,718
How about "God bless Haiti"
or "God bless Africa"?

481
00:29:10,796 --> 00:29:12,627
How about "God bless Jamaica"?

482
00:29:12,698 --> 00:29:16,293
I'm not talking about Jamaica,
the beach tribes you all love.

483
00:29:16,368 --> 00:29:20,236
I'm talking about stabbing Jamaica.
That's what I'm talking about.

484
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:25,242
So, tonight I want to say:
"God bless America, and everybody else!"

485
00:29:25,745 --> 00:29:27,940
The whole world! God bless you!

486
00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:32,507
I'm Mays Gilliam, and I'm running for
President of the United States of America.

487
00:29:32,685 --> 00:29:33,913
Ya heard?

488
00:29:56,509 --> 00:29:58,477
Now we can watch Martin!

489
00:30:11,724 --> 00:30:14,750
-Hello?
-Good morning, Mr. President.

490
00:30:16,395 --> 00:30:19,694
-What time is it?
-I think it's a little after 7::00.

491
00:30:20,032 --> 00:30:23,524
-Lisa, I need some help in here!
-Will you wait a damn minute?

492
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:27,066
I was so proud of you.
You were so good last night.

493
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:33,709
Tonight, no matter what, win or lose,
I want to see you.

494
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:36,009
I don't know. I might have to work.

495
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:38,606
But if I don't see you tonight,
I will see you soon.

496
00:30:38,684 --> 00:30:42,814
Just run your race, get out there,
and do what you got to do, okay?

497
00:30:42,988 --> 00:30:45,752
-I'll talk to you later. Bye.
-All right.

498
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:49,728
It's Election Day, Tuesday,
November 8, 2004.

499
00:30:49,795 --> 00:30:51,660
The stage is set for what will be...

500
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:54,528
one of the most dramatic campaign finales
of all time.

501
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:58,228
The question everyone's asking is:
"Who will America vote for?"

502
00:30:58,871 --> 00:31:00,498
I voted for Mays Gilliam.

503
00:31:00,606 --> 00:31:03,268
-I voted for big business.
-I voted for Lewis.

504
00:31:03,409 --> 00:31:06,003
Who the fuck you think I'm voting for?

505
00:31:06,478 --> 00:31:08,275
There seems to be an agreement...

506
00:31:08,347 --> 00:31:11,748
between Washington, D.C., officials
and transit authority operators...

507
00:31:11,817 --> 00:31:14,513
regarding the shutdown
of the 9th Ward bus line.

508
00:31:14,587 --> 00:31:17,249
I don't see how they could do this to us.

509
00:31:17,323 --> 00:31:20,656
People got to make money and get to work.

510
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:26,130
-Show them how you do it.
-The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire

511
00:31:26,198 --> 00:31:29,429
You're not gonna believe this.
We got the Teamsters!

512
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:33,232
-That's great, little brother!
-They'll announce it at a press conference.

513
00:31:33,305 --> 00:31:35,933
You just have to go,
shake hands, take photographs...

514
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:37,770
but it is yours.

515
00:31:40,212 --> 00:31:41,304
What's the matter?

516
00:31:41,413 --> 00:31:45,213
If they shut down this bus service,
I will drive you to work myself.

517
00:31:46,285 --> 00:31:48,913
-I can't do it.
-But it's Election Day!

518
00:31:48,988 --> 00:31:51,821
You have to get the endorsement.
You said you want to win.

519
00:31:51,891 --> 00:31:54,917
You can't snub the Teamsters.
You want them to endorse Lewis?

520
00:31:55,027 --> 00:31:57,791
I'm not worried about Lewis.
I'm running my race.

521
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,298
Go ahead, baby brother. I got this.

522
00:32:02,301 --> 00:32:05,099
-You're just gonna let him go?
-He's a grown man.

523
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:09,004
They shut down the whole bus line.
What can he do about that?

524
00:32:17,883 --> 00:32:22,183
In the latest exit poll, Vice President Lewis
has 51 percent of the vote.

525
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:23,949
Bring him back. He got to vote.

526
00:32:24,023 --> 00:32:27,515
...while Mays Gilliam
is posting an impressive 47 percent.

527
00:32:28,761 --> 00:32:30,888
You gotta get to the back of the bus.

528
00:32:30,963 --> 00:32:32,726
I'm just playing. Come on.

529
00:32:33,098 --> 00:32:37,000
Now, he and Vice President Lewis
are in a statistical dead heat.

530
00:32:37,069 --> 00:32:38,559
Come on, hoes!

531
00:32:38,671 --> 00:32:42,869
While Lewis and Mitch Gilliam
have been working the campaign trail...

532
00:32:43,175 --> 00:32:46,269
Mays Gilliam has been out
driving people to work.

533
00:32:48,714 --> 00:32:51,683
Damn it! Why didn't somebody around here
think of this?

534
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,275
Why am I not out there driving a damn bus?

535
00:32:54,353 --> 00:32:57,652
Get me an SUV, a minivan, a bus,
a scooter...

536
00:32:57,723 --> 00:32:59,816
a motorcycle, or a rickshaw.

537
00:32:59,892 --> 00:33:01,359
Get me some wheels, bitch!

538
00:33:02,728 --> 00:33:04,525
Are you going uptown?

539
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:07,663
Come on. Wait a minute!

540
00:33:08,968 --> 00:33:11,095
We could write our own vows!

541
00:33:11,971 --> 00:33:14,872
I love you, Mays!

542
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:19,869
With the polls about 30 minutes
from closing on the East Coast...

543
00:33:19,979 --> 00:33:23,642
Mays Gilliam is actually ahead
by several points.

544
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:28,811
There is no question that Lewis has Texas.

545
00:33:30,622 --> 00:33:33,921
It seems clear
Gilliam is going to take New York.

546
00:33:38,297 --> 00:33:39,286
New York!

547
00:33:39,365 --> 00:33:41,424
It's likely Lewis will take Michigan.

548
00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:47,204
It looks like Gilliam
might just pull an upset in lllinois.

549
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:50,508
Illinois!

550
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,477
Go, Mays!

551
00:33:52,544 --> 00:33:55,172
This looks like
it may come down to California.

552
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,874
This looks like
it may come down to California.

553
00:33:57,916 --> 00:34:00,407
This looks like
it may come down to California.

554
00:34:02,354 --> 00:34:05,812
I need to know. How real is this?
Can we win without California?

555
00:34:05,891 --> 00:34:09,452
We stand a chance if you call
your connections to the energy companies--

556
00:34:09,528 --> 00:34:12,122
No, you can't win without California.

557
00:34:12,264 --> 00:34:13,697
What are you doing here?

558
00:34:13,766 --> 00:34:17,099
Shut up. You want to win,
you'll do what I tell you.

559
00:34:17,503 --> 00:34:20,404
Gilliam has
over 90 percent minority turnout.

560
00:34:20,506 --> 00:34:24,670
Whites are the majority,
but they're not voting. They don't like you.

561
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,001
-I like you, sir.
-Shut up.

562
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:29,274
How can we turn this around?

563
00:34:29,348 --> 00:34:32,749
There's about one and a half hours left
at the West Coast polls.

564
00:34:32,818 --> 00:34:36,584
If there's a leak saying Gilliam
is going to win, you'll get a late rush.

565
00:34:36,655 --> 00:34:39,453
You get California, you get the election.

566
00:34:40,492 --> 00:34:45,156
It will make the 6:30 news if we do it now.
We just have to put it out there.

567
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,495
-Can we do this?
-We're the government. We can do anything.

568
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:52,199
The race for President
now turns to the West Coast.

569
00:34:52,271 --> 00:34:55,206
People, Armageddon is upon us
and Big Dave is scared.

570
00:34:55,307 --> 00:34:59,744
If these voting trends sustain,
it's likely that for the first time in history...

571
00:34:59,812 --> 00:35:03,839
a black man will become
President of the United States of America.

572
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:43,816
"I have a dream that one day...

573
00:35:45,591 --> 00:35:47,957
"this nation will rise up...

574
00:35:49,261 --> 00:35:52,196
"and live out the true meaning of its creed:

575
00:35:53,098 --> 00:35:56,192
"'We hold these truths to be self-evident:

576
00:35:56,435 --> 00:35:58,767
"'that all men are created equal. "'

577
00:35:59,738 --> 00:36:00,727
Checkmate.

578
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:03,239
I, Richard Nixon, do solemnly swear....

579
00:36:03,308 --> 00:36:05,469
I, Ronald Reagan, do solemnly swear....

580
00:36:12,518 --> 00:36:14,349
The race for President is over.

581
00:36:15,888 --> 00:36:17,412
The election is now over.

582
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:19,855
-The race for President....
-...is over.

583
00:36:22,461 --> 00:36:24,486
The race for President is over.

584
00:36:24,863 --> 00:36:28,924
For the first time in history,
a black man, Mays Gilliam...

585
00:36:29,668 --> 00:36:33,502
will be the next President
of the United States of America.

586
00:36:52,691 --> 00:36:54,283
Come here, brother.

587
00:36:56,929 --> 00:36:59,022
-I love you, man!
-I love you, too.

588
00:37:08,073 --> 00:37:10,303
I appreciate it. Thanks a lot.

589
00:37:13,045 --> 00:37:14,376
Thank you.

590
00:37:16,982 --> 00:37:19,883
We won! Aren't you happy?

591
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:22,378
-Can I have a massage?
-Yes!

592
00:37:22,788 --> 00:37:24,653
I won!

593
00:37:26,491 --> 00:37:29,892
There is no way in the world
I could have ever done this without you.

594
00:37:29,962 --> 00:37:31,156
You're damn right.

595
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,256
We won! We did it! Yes!

596
00:37:36,168 --> 00:37:38,102
Look at my little brother!

597
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:41,867
-Boy, I'm proud of you! Mr. President!
-Mr. Vice President.

598
00:37:41,974 --> 00:37:46,434
You're the man! You ain't got to worry about
no assassinations or nothing.

599
00:37:46,545 --> 00:37:48,979
They sure don't want me
to be the next President.

600
00:37:49,047 --> 00:37:51,242
You can raise taxes, start a war....

601
00:37:51,316 --> 00:37:53,045
Mays Gilliam began this race....

602
00:37:53,118 --> 00:37:55,985
That's my man!

603
00:37:57,923 --> 00:37:59,584
Excuse me, please.

604
00:38:01,293 --> 00:38:03,761
-I've been looking for you.
-I was looking for you.

605
00:38:03,829 --> 00:38:06,320
-This is amazing!
-It's amazing.

606
00:38:06,398 --> 00:38:08,195
It's incredible.

607
00:38:08,267 --> 00:38:10,360
-What you were up against.
-The odds!

608
00:38:10,435 --> 00:38:13,802
I can't wait to start working,
and do I have a job for you!

609
00:38:14,606 --> 00:38:18,508
I don't know what to say. What department
do you want me to work in? Finance?

610
00:38:18,577 --> 00:38:21,603
No, that's not good enough for you.

611
00:38:21,713 --> 00:38:24,113
-Foreign Affairs?
-No, not Foreign Affairs.

612
00:38:24,182 --> 00:38:27,379
I thought you could do
something real good in Security!

613
00:38:28,287 --> 00:38:29,549
You suck!

614
00:38:34,593 --> 00:38:37,790
We'd like you to run for President.

615
00:38:38,196 --> 00:38:41,495
Sometimes, you don't know
if people like you for you.

616
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:43,696
I like you for you.

617
00:38:43,969 --> 00:38:45,459
Thanks a lot.

618
00:38:47,906 --> 00:38:50,238
Get your hand off my ass, boy!

619
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:52,902
Wait!

620
00:38:56,515 --> 00:38:59,712
Oh, my God, you are everywhere.
Look at you!

621
00:39:02,287 --> 00:39:05,154
What's the first thing
you're going to do, Mr. President?

622
00:39:05,223 --> 00:39:08,420
The first thing I'll do
is make you my First Lady.

623
00:39:09,227 --> 00:39:11,923
-Don't you play with me like that.
-I'm not playing.

624
00:39:11,997 --> 00:39:13,191
You can't do that!

625
00:39:13,265 --> 00:39:15,859
I'm the government. I can do anything.

626
00:39:32,651 --> 00:39:33,777
Get ready for...

627
00:39:33,852 --> 00:39:37,879
the 2005 Presidential Inaugural Ball.

628
00:39:38,023 --> 00:39:42,722
Ladies and gentlemen, the President
of the United States of America...

629
00:39:42,794 --> 00:39:46,662
Mays Gilliam, and his future First Wifey...

630
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:48,290
Lisa Clark!

631
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:02,743
Look at him now, man
Ain't this great

632
00:40:02,814 --> 00:40:04,975
Biggest man in town
He's the head of state

633
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,541
They come from all around
just for one handshake

634
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:10,816
Look at him now
He's the head of state

635
00:40:16,995 --> 00:40:19,793
That's me, Mays Gilliam...

636
00:40:19,898 --> 00:40:22,765
President of the United States of America.

637
00:40:23,168 --> 00:40:24,533
North America.

638
00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:33,438
-Who did you vote for?
-For what?

639
00:40:33,545 --> 00:40:35,035
-For President.
-Of what?

640
00:40:35,147 --> 00:40:37,513
-Of the United States.
-Of what?

641
00:40:37,582 --> 00:40:39,311
-Of America.
-What America?

642
00:40:39,384 --> 00:40:40,510
North America.

643
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:43,611
Slick, I don't vote.
You gonna buy some of this meat, or what?

644
00:40:43,822 --> 00:40:48,316
You can't trust nobody.
Everybody's trying to rob you. Nobody!

645
00:40:48,427 --> 00:40:50,861
That guy right there! Don't trust him!

646
00:40:50,929 --> 00:40:52,760
Can't trust no-damn-body!

647
00:40:52,831 --> 00:40:55,356
America is taking advantage of you!

648
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,130
You can go to war when you're 18,
but you can't have a drink till you're 21!

649
00:41:00,338 --> 00:41:03,569
-That ain't right!
-Right! So, let me get this straight.

650
00:41:03,675 --> 00:41:05,939
You're 18 years old. You go to war.

651
00:41:06,044 --> 00:41:08,478
You come back. Your leg is chopped off!

652
00:41:08,547 --> 00:41:10,242
You got a damn nub!

653
00:41:10,315 --> 00:41:12,783
Everywhere you go they say,
"What's up, nubby?"

654
00:41:12,884 --> 00:41:16,342
You get to the bar and say,
"Bartender, can I have a drink?"

655
00:41:16,421 --> 00:41:20,118
He looks you up and down and says,
"l got to see some lD."

656
00:41:20,192 --> 00:41:24,891
ID? You mean to tell me
a one-legged teenager can't have a drink?

657
00:41:25,063 --> 00:41:28,624
-That ain't right!
-Where is the nub?

658
00:41:28,733 --> 00:41:33,033
Prescription drugs, I'll lower the prices.
Let me explain something else to you.

659
00:41:33,104 --> 00:41:34,696
You can survive a stroke...

660
00:41:34,773 --> 00:41:38,231
but the high prices of medicine
will give you a heart attack.

661
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:42,041
America is the richest,
most powerful nation on earth.

662
00:41:42,147 --> 00:41:46,174
If America was a car, it would be a Bentley...

663
00:41:46,251 --> 00:41:50,711
sitting on chrome doves,
with TVs in the headrests...

664
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:54,190
and a fine, naked Puerto Rican girl
feeding you grapes!

665
00:41:54,459 --> 00:41:58,020
Ain't nothing better than that!
Ain't nothing ever been better than that!

666
00:41:58,096 --> 00:42:02,260
Most opponents are saying your brother
destroyed any chance of winning...

667
00:42:02,334 --> 00:42:04,461
by naming you as his running mate. Why?

668
00:42:04,536 --> 00:42:07,266
-Why'd your brother make you anchorman?
-I don't have--

669
00:42:07,339 --> 00:42:10,604
You said it was your brother.
I did my homework as well, okay?

670
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:12,768
You got your job same way I got mine.

671
00:42:12,878 --> 00:42:16,575
-I'm not running for public office.
-I'm not running for anchorman.
