1
00:00:00,681 --> 00:00:02,820
Sharon Stone is a defector.

2
00:00:02,889 --> 00:00:06,205
That's what Lewis campaign insiders
are saying about the Hollywood star...

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,786
and cousin of Vice President Lewis,
after Stone's endorsement of Mays Gilliam.

4
00:00:10,855 --> 00:00:12,065
I don't believe it!

5
00:00:13,863 --> 00:00:14,812
Yeah!

6
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:17,924
I know!

7
00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:20,160
Did you hear....

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,265
What are you doing here?

9
00:00:23,334 --> 00:00:25,984
Gilliam is over 30 points.

10
00:00:27,046 --> 00:00:30,340
That means even if he loses
he's the frontrunner in 2008.

11
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,339
In case you've forgotten,
I intend to run for President in 2008...

12
00:00:33,413 --> 00:00:35,168
and I am not running against him.

13
00:00:35,524 --> 00:00:38,458
So this is over.
Either you put a stop to it or I will.

14
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:42,109
I came on board to run a campaign
for a man we didn't expect to win...

15
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:44,218
not to sabotage him so he'd lose.

16
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:47,674
You're in this as thick as I am.
Of course he's supposed to lose!

17
00:00:47,746 --> 00:00:49,121
That's why we picked him.

18
00:00:49,187 --> 00:00:51,521
Are you with me or are you with him?

19
00:00:51,586 --> 00:00:53,658
I thought you wanted
what was best for the party.

20
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,290
I'm what's best for the party!

21
00:00:56,258 --> 00:00:57,567
What's the matter?

22
00:00:57,633 --> 00:01:00,731
Democracy doesn't work for you
when you're not winning?

23
00:01:02,305 --> 00:01:03,646
I'm with him.

24
00:01:10,783 --> 00:01:12,060
I'm with him?

25
00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:23,547
-Who are these people again?
-The Urban Business Board.

26
00:01:23,613 --> 00:01:26,548
-What are your plans for Social Security?
-Give it to old people.

27
00:01:26,622 --> 00:01:28,956
-Your plans on global warming?
-Global ice tea.

28
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:30,613
-You the man!
-You the woman!

29
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:35,834
I want to introduce you
to Chester Norris Allen.

30
00:01:36,124 --> 00:01:40,182
He owns a bottling plant in D.C.
and I spoke to him about our problem.

31
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:41,680
We've got a nice check for you.

32
00:01:41,755 --> 00:01:44,340
We can't take it. You sell malt liquor to kids.

33
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:45,655
I do no such thing.

34
00:01:45,755 --> 00:01:49,780
Come on, man. It's orange beer
with a nipple top. Now, who's that for?

35
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,603
It's Crib Malt Liquor, man!

36
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,177
He's unbelievable!

37
00:01:53,817 --> 00:01:57,078
Damn it, we need that money!
Why do you make everything so difficult?

38
00:01:57,145 --> 00:01:59,054
It's Crib Malt Liquor!

39
00:01:59,545 --> 00:02:02,359
"Crib Malt Liquor,
just like Mama used to make"?

40
00:02:02,424 --> 00:02:03,918
Whose mama? Not my mama!

41
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:08,437
The situation is getting tense with the threat
of the bus line being shut down.

42
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:11,318
Protestors took their concerns
to transit officials...

43
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:15,212
but talks broke down when the newly
appointed alderman, Reginald Shannon...

44
00:02:15,286 --> 00:02:17,904
was punched in the face
by an angry protestor.

45
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:22,642
-Good evening, sir.
-What's up, Nikki?

46
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,320
I noticed you weren't at the party,
so I thought...

47
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:31,188
if there is anything you would like
for me to do, I would be happy to.

48
00:02:32,372 --> 00:02:33,801
Could I ask you something?

49
00:02:35,124 --> 00:02:36,269
Yes.

50
00:02:37,523 --> 00:02:39,792
You seem like a nice girl.

51
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,468
How did you get into this line of work?

52
00:02:49,074 --> 00:02:51,495
I went to the University of Nebraska...

53
00:02:51,665 --> 00:02:54,512
where I majored
in Theater and Communications.

54
00:02:54,705 --> 00:02:57,966
I did some extra work,
and a few things that went straight to video.

55
00:03:02,096 --> 00:03:03,045
Okay.

56
00:03:03,536 --> 00:03:05,128
Can I ask you a question?

57
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,377
Yeah, sure.

58
00:03:06,544 --> 00:03:10,766
Since I've been here, you haven't really
given me any assignments.

59
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,125
I was wondering if you find me attractive.

60
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:19,881
I think you're....

61
00:03:19,982 --> 00:03:22,731
I think you're very attractive. It's just that...

62
00:03:23,757 --> 00:03:28,197
I like to get to know people
before I get involved.

63
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:32,389
I don't mean to be out of line, sir...

64
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:35,040
but are you?

65
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,560
Am I what?

66
00:03:39,627 --> 00:03:41,699
Trying to get to know somebody.

67
00:03:46,858 --> 00:03:50,119
-lt is late, I'm out of here.
-You need to take a cab.

68
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:52,672
I'll be fine. I'm just gonna walk.

69
00:03:58,824 --> 00:04:00,417
Take a cab!

70
00:04:01,352 --> 00:04:03,457
I'll be fine. I'll walk.

71
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:12,159
Need a ride?

72
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:19,803
Where are we going?

73
00:04:19,941 --> 00:04:22,178
I just thought I'd give you a little tour.

74
00:04:34,212 --> 00:04:37,507
If you look over there,
it's the Lincoln Memorial.

75
00:04:38,755 --> 00:04:40,315
Lincoln freed the slaves...

76
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:44,063
but before he did it, he said,
"First you niggers got to build me a statue."

77
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,385
Right there is the Jefferson Memorial.

78
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,337
Jefferson had a black mistress.

79
00:04:50,401 --> 00:04:54,427
He said, "All men are created equal,
but black women got the nicest ass!"

80
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:58,330
That's the Treasury.

81
00:04:58,496 --> 00:05:02,074
If you look real hard in the window,
you can see Oprah counting her money.

82
00:05:03,968 --> 00:05:06,935
$20 trillion one, $20 trillion two....

83
00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:08,085
Hi, Oprah!

84
00:05:14,046 --> 00:05:15,290
What's it like...

85
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:19,252
traveling all over the country
and meeting all those people?

86
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:23,384
I like it. I like traveling,
I like meeting the people.

87
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:27,642
But sometimes, you don't know
if people like you for you.

88
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,129
-Know what I mean?
-I like you for you.

89
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:34,009
And I think you're okay.

90
00:05:34,332 --> 00:05:36,186
-Just okay?
-I'm just playing.

91
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,105
I forgot how nice D.C. was.

92
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:45,303
I'm always working.
I never get a chance to check it out.

93
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,500
Maybe you need to take advantage
of what's in front of you.

94
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:52,693
You never know, you may look up someday,
and it might not be there.

95
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,287
Freeze!

96
00:05:58,616 --> 00:06:02,063
Put your hands up in the air
and step away from Mr. Gilliam!

97
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:03,280
It's okay!

98
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,130
-What the hell are you doing?
-What the hell are you doing?

99
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,995
You can't go dashing off
in the middle of the night with some girl.

100
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,623
Something's happened.
We got to pack and get out of here!

101
00:06:12,726 --> 00:06:15,115
Somebody make sure she gets home safely.

102
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,549
We have a plane waiting for us.

103
00:06:23,252 --> 00:06:27,114
In Florida today, guns and explosives
were found at a junior high school.

104
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:30,962
No one was injured in the incident,
but with just six weeks till Election Day...

105
00:06:31,187 --> 00:06:33,576
this could be a hot-button issue
for both parties.

106
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:36,618
Now, back to the Jay-Z song
already in progress.

107
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:41,262
Muhammad, get me a gun
in case another kid tries to get crazy.

108
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,842
This could work in our favor.
Florida is a big Second Amendment state.

109
00:06:44,913 --> 00:06:47,563
This is serious. This is not the Player's Ball.

110
00:06:47,632 --> 00:06:51,309
You can cut into Lewis' numbers.
Talk about the kids, not about the guns.

111
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,739
If I get shot, everybody is fired.

112
00:06:54,256 --> 00:06:55,401
One question here.

113
00:06:55,472 --> 00:06:59,049
There's been an outcry that something
needs to be done about school violence.

114
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,941
What do you plan to do about this?

115
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:03,014
I feel we need to talk to our kids....

116
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:15,650
Excuse me.

117
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,850
Hello, children.

118
00:07:20,364 --> 00:07:21,574
Good morning.

119
00:07:23,372 --> 00:07:26,852
Pay attention.
This is going to be a class: Bullshit 101.

120
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:30,698
Ladies and gentlemen,
our American children are hurting today...

121
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,286
and we need to reach out to them...

122
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:36,005
and give them all
a good old-fashioned American hug.

123
00:07:37,994 --> 00:07:41,376
America is the greatest country
on the face of the earth...

124
00:07:41,897 --> 00:07:43,271
and I want to say:

125
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,182
God bless America!

126
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,326
And no place else.

127
00:07:47,496 --> 00:07:49,536
Thank you. Thank you, children.

128
00:07:49,609 --> 00:07:52,226
No more bombs now. And don't use guns.

129
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:54,941
-That went well.
-Very touching.

130
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,804
-The kids liked me.
-You were very genuine.

131
00:07:56,871 --> 00:07:58,398
They responded.

132
00:07:58,471 --> 00:08:01,504
I tried to hug a girl and a boy
so I wouldn't seem sexist.

133
00:08:02,246 --> 00:08:03,871
Mr. Vice President!

134
00:08:04,486 --> 00:08:06,341
Welcome to the show, Alderman Gilliam.

135
00:08:06,406 --> 00:08:08,642
Surprised you're not somewhere
with your girlfriend.

136
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,822
How do you know about her?

137
00:08:09,893 --> 00:08:12,348
I'm the government. I know everything.

138
00:08:12,485 --> 00:08:13,892
We really should debate.

139
00:08:15,684 --> 00:08:17,506
Let's get something straight.

140
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:20,222
I don't know you, and I don't like you.

141
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,256
Party's over. I'm fixing to whip your ass.

142
00:08:24,995 --> 00:08:26,337
You got it?

143
00:08:30,371 --> 00:08:31,931
Sir, we really should debate.

144
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:36,854
God bless America, and no place else.

145
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,674
Sir, we just got this off the uplink.

146
00:08:43,905 --> 00:08:44,799
What is it?

147
00:08:44,865 --> 00:08:47,581
An off-the-record comment by Mays Gilliam.

148
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:49,402
-Bad?
-Yes, sir.

149
00:08:49,983 --> 00:08:50,998
Good work.

150
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,414
It's on! Guys, come here!

151
00:08:59,486 --> 00:09:02,715
...Lewis was on the scene
comforting parents and students.

152
00:09:03,518 --> 00:09:05,852
The press is in Lewis' back pocket.

153
00:09:06,557 --> 00:09:10,169
In this CNB News exclusive,
our cameras caught Gilliam...

154
00:09:10,397 --> 00:09:14,258
making what was arguably
the most controversial statement of the day.

155
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:17,394
They act like us.
We're bombing countries all the time.

156
00:09:17,468 --> 00:09:19,507
If I was 12, I'd have a gun, too.

157
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,758
Tell me you didn't say that.

158
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:24,536
I didn't know the camera was on me.
I was playing around with some sound guy.

159
00:09:24,603 --> 00:09:26,839
You didn't know the camera was on you?

160
00:09:28,091 --> 00:09:32,018
Of course it's on you. It's always on you!
You're running for President!

161
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,202
I told you....

162
00:09:33,274 --> 00:09:35,413
This is all your fault!

163
00:09:36,954 --> 00:09:40,052
Gilliam is under investigation by the FBI...

164
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,943
for his involvement with this man...

165
00:09:42,137 --> 00:09:45,584
friend and associate
and accused drug lord, Warren Pryor.

166
00:09:45,656 --> 00:09:48,241
-Lord, we're going to jail.
-We're not going to jail.

167
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:49,358
Is it true?

168
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,952
What's up, Warren?

169
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:54,990
I know him, but I don't drug-lord know him.

170
00:09:55,063 --> 00:09:58,990
It's just a guy I say "What's up?" to.
But I don't know him know him.

171
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:02,257
Do you have drugs on you?
Get them off, I'm not going to jail for you.

172
00:10:02,325 --> 00:10:03,569
Are you on the pipe?

173
00:10:04,118 --> 00:10:06,092
This is messed up
This really sucks

174
00:10:06,165 --> 00:10:08,434
Every time you're doing good
trouble just pops up

175
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:10,672
He doesn't know what he's gonna do

176
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:15,507
This is messed up
This really sucks

177
00:10:15,572 --> 00:10:17,514
Keep your head up, it's your best bet

178
00:10:17,587 --> 00:10:19,627
Let's hope the election's not through

179
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,823
If you see Mays Gilliam,
please do not call the authorities.

180
00:10:24,115 --> 00:10:27,692
Just do whatever you can
to make his life a living hell.

181
00:10:28,402 --> 00:10:29,449
No more questions!

182
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:32,817
If I see Mays Gilliam,
I'll bust a cap in his ass.

183
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:37,289
Gilliam is done
and Big Dave says, "Waa-waa!"

184
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:39,274
Oh, God.

185
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:41,738
What am I going to do?

186
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:46,056
What are you worried about?
Your face isn't on the side of a bus.

187
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:48,232
I'll be the one taking a hit for this.

188
00:10:48,303 --> 00:10:52,678
Get me on the news so I can apologize.
That's what the people want to hear.

189
00:10:52,911 --> 00:10:54,187
You're probably right.

190
00:10:54,255 --> 00:10:56,743
Make a statement of some kind,
try and sound sincere--

191
00:10:56,814 --> 00:10:58,440
Just give me a break!

192
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,376
You think you can say you're sorry
and all of this will go away?

193
00:11:03,405 --> 00:11:07,496
Mays, you're running for President
of the United States of America.

194
00:11:09,164 --> 00:11:12,612
Do you have any idea why they chose you?

195
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,152
-We picked you because--
-Shut up!

196
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:25,127
You're here to lose.

197
00:11:26,506 --> 00:11:28,927
Arnot picked you so you could lose.

198
00:11:29,673 --> 00:11:31,495
Think about it.

199
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:34,787
If they had any idea
they could win this thing...

200
00:11:34,857 --> 00:11:38,435
do you think they would have chosen
an ignorant-ass nigger like you?

201
00:11:43,432 --> 00:11:44,676
Wait up.

202
00:11:45,096 --> 00:11:48,030
You're not calling me an ignorant nigger...

203
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:50,590
and thinking you're staying on my bus.

204
00:11:51,815 --> 00:11:55,011
I am not getting off this bus.
We're in the middle of nowhere--

205
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,599
Now you need a ride
from an ignorant nigger.

206
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,425
I am not getting off this bus!

207
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,731
Apologize.

208
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:02,595
Security!

209
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:05,403
Damn you, Mays Gilliam!

210
00:12:07,141 --> 00:12:09,213
You knew about this all along?

211
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:34,041
Is there trouble
inside the Gilliam campaign?

212
00:12:34,113 --> 00:12:37,658
That's what Washington insiders
want to know after Gilliam's chief advisor...

213
00:12:37,728 --> 00:12:40,477
Debra Lassiter, left the campaign trail.

214
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:42,910
Down in the polls,
Gilliam still has no running mate.

215
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:45,464
Sources say
the Teamsters may endorse Lewis.

216
00:12:45,536 --> 00:12:48,056
Did Gilliam kill JonBenet Ramsay?
Police want to know.

217
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:50,844
The big question: Where is Mays Gilliam?

218
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:54,836
I'll tell you where he's at.
He's with his peeps!

219
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:01,752
-Hello?
-You up?

220
00:13:02,205 --> 00:13:04,922
I was hoping you'd call. Are you okay?

221
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:07,442
I don't know. I guess I'm all right.

222
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:10,133
Come on, talk to Mama.

223
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,076
I don't know.
It seems like they're trying to get me.

224
00:13:13,147 --> 00:13:16,016
Everywhere I turn,
they're trying to put a foot in my ass.

225
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:19,320
After what you said,
you need a foot put up in your ass.

226
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:22,452
What did you expect?
They would just make you President?

227
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:25,302
They take a poll for everything I do.

228
00:13:25,817 --> 00:13:30,356
You ever been to a horserace?
My dad used to take me when I was little.

229
00:13:31,161 --> 00:13:33,463
The horses wear blinders.

230
00:13:34,137 --> 00:13:37,584
They don't even see each other.
They just run their race.

231
00:13:38,104 --> 00:13:41,365
So don't worry about Lewis,
don't worry about the press...

232
00:13:41,464 --> 00:13:43,406
just run your race.

233
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,166
Let me ask you something.

234
00:13:45,271 --> 00:13:46,253
Okay.

235
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,267
What are you wearing?

236
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,582
Now, you know you need to stop.

237
00:13:58,069 --> 00:14:00,240
Man, news travels fast.

238
00:14:00,597 --> 00:14:04,339
Not 10 minutes after you fired me,
I had two offers for jobs.

239
00:14:04,404 --> 00:14:05,451
Good offers.

240
00:14:05,524 --> 00:14:06,865
What are you doing here?

241
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:10,472
I know you got no reason to trust me,
but I'm asking you to.

242
00:14:10,804 --> 00:14:12,778
You've got five weeks left.

243
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:15,698
I know Lassiter is out, but I think...

244
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:18,834
I can help you do this.

245
00:14:18,898 --> 00:14:20,491
I want to help you.

246
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,519
And I'm sorry, Mays.

247
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,048
I don't know what else to say...

248
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:30,347
but as bad as things look,
I don't think you should quit.

249
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:32,972
Who said I was quitting?

250
00:14:33,424 --> 00:14:34,951
I wish I could quit.

251
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,712
I wish it was that easy.

252
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,301
You're lucky.

253
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,824
You are so lucky.
You don't know how good you got it.

254
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:44,909
You just represent yourself.

255
00:14:44,974 --> 00:14:46,054
Me?

256
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,964
I represent my whole race.

257
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:51,052
If I quit...

258
00:14:51,118 --> 00:14:54,216
there won't be another black candidate
for 50 years.

259
00:14:56,237 --> 00:14:57,316
All right.

260
00:14:58,989 --> 00:15:02,665
We can get rid of the school thing
with a statement that will blow things over.

261
00:15:02,828 --> 00:15:04,170
But we need a running mate.

262
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,854
Who am I supposed to pick?
Nobody wants to run with me.

263
00:15:06,924 --> 00:15:08,898
We need somebody we can trust.

264
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:12,680
Who do you trust?

265
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:16,674
In the midst of his own Cinderella story...

266
00:15:16,746 --> 00:15:19,560
presidential candidate
Gilliam is shaking it up.

267
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,211
He's chosen his brother, Mitch Gilliam...

268
00:15:22,282 --> 00:15:25,281
a bail bondsman from Chicago,
as his running mate.

269
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:28,836
Political analysts say this may be
too little, too late.

270
00:15:28,905 --> 00:15:30,944
Hi, I'm with the Pork Commission--

271
00:15:31,112 --> 00:15:33,533
I'm from the Athlete's Foot--

272
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,840
Brother!

273
00:15:36,007 --> 00:15:38,462
Can you get my demo tape to somebody--

274
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:48,703
Are these your bags?

275
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:51,293
Look at my shoes and at the bags.
Shut up and follow me.

276
00:15:53,221 --> 00:15:54,628
Back up.

277
00:16:01,188 --> 00:16:04,417
What do you have to say about
your brother's controversial comments?

278
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,093
My gosh, lady,
my brother said he was sorry. Let it go.

279
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,332
See, that's why nobody like your ass.

280
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:14,942
We got work to do.
We way behind in the polls.

281
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,865
-Am I getting paid for this?
-Yeah.

282
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:21,301
You're running for the vice presidency.
You're a bail bondsman.

283
00:16:21,377 --> 00:16:25,468
You have no Washington experience,
no political experience or connections.

284
00:16:25,537 --> 00:16:29,311
How does being a bail bondsman
qualify you to be Vice President?

285
00:16:30,048 --> 00:16:31,509
I am a bail bondsman.

286
00:16:31,648 --> 00:16:34,233
People come to me when they in trouble,
like the USA.

287
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,791
We bail people out. We bail out Mexico...

288
00:16:36,864 --> 00:16:39,613
the savings and loan, the airline industry.

289
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:42,971
Now you ask me, sir,
what qualify me to run for Vice President.

290
00:16:43,038 --> 00:16:45,427
When the country is in trouble,
I'll bail them out.

291
00:16:45,502 --> 00:16:47,990
Hold that thought.
We have a caller from Detroit.

292
00:16:48,062 --> 00:16:52,284
Mitch! Why you looking around?
It's Reggie.... Where my money at?

293
00:16:52,349 --> 00:16:55,032
Don't call me with that bullshit!
You see I'm on TV.

294
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:56,628
What about NATO?

295
00:16:56,701 --> 00:17:00,115
I never met Nato.
I don't talk about people behind their back.

296
00:17:00,188 --> 00:17:02,609
NATO is the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.

297
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:05,882
I thought you were talking about
this guy named Nato.

298
00:17:05,947 --> 00:17:07,856
But you have to know these things.

299
00:17:07,963 --> 00:17:09,970
Do you know Nato Jacobs?

300
00:17:10,139 --> 00:17:13,073
Do you know Nato Jacobs?

301
00:17:13,274 --> 00:17:14,932
I'm sorry, I haven't met the gentleman.

302
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:16,409
That's what I said.

303
00:17:16,473 --> 00:17:19,539
You know nothing about Nato?
I know nothing about NATO.

304
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:22,998
Why are you out here
since inmates don't have the right to vote?

305
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:25,814
It's not about the vote.
We're looking out for the convicts.

306
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,782
We want to make sure
when they get out that they stay out.

307
00:17:28,856 --> 00:17:32,401
The better the education,
they become more productive citizens.

308
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:34,029
Mitch! What's up?

309
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:35,183
Shorty G!

310
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,913
It's good to see you, boy!

311
00:17:36,982 --> 00:17:40,659
This is Shorty G. I arrested his ass.
I thought you got the chair, boy.

312
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,020
Mr. Gilliam, how would you deal
with white-collar crime?

313
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:46,731
There's no such thing as white-collar crime.

314
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:49,040
And there's no such thing
as black-on-black crime.

315
00:17:49,141 --> 00:17:50,286
Crime is crime.

316
00:17:50,357 --> 00:17:53,837
I don't care if you have a white collar
or a tank top.

317
00:17:54,068 --> 00:17:56,621
If you rob me, I'll whup your ass.

318
00:17:58,132 --> 00:18:02,092
I'm Janet Silvers reporting live in D.C.,
where transit operators....

319
00:18:02,163 --> 00:18:05,032
-I wish we'd get into the White House.
-To have a cookout?

320
00:18:05,106 --> 00:18:07,146
They were just talking about your ward.

321
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,462
What's going on down there?

322
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,272
They want to cut bus service
until they finish construction. I should go.

323
00:18:12,337 --> 00:18:15,184
-So you can blow up the bus line?
-One thing at a time.

324
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,926
The Teamsters haven't endorsed Lewis yet.
Our numbers are going up.

325
00:18:18,993 --> 00:18:22,189
If we want a real shot at this thing,
we got to get Lewis to debate.

326
00:18:22,256 --> 00:18:24,078
He knows that. That's why he won't.

327
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,184
He's avoiding me
like he owes me child support.

328
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:29,255
He is scared. He's holding the ball,
hoping the clock will run out.

329
00:18:29,327 --> 00:18:32,142
That's a punk move.
Ducking and hiding like a little bitch!

330
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:35,587
That may be, but he won't debate you
because you call him a little bitch.

331
00:18:38,286 --> 00:18:40,523
What this community needs--

332
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,437
Is for you to debate me right now!

333
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:44,875
Tell the people that!

334
00:18:44,941 --> 00:18:47,275
I thought I told you that we won't stop.

335
00:18:47,437 --> 00:18:48,779
Now, my agenda--

336
00:18:48,845 --> 00:18:50,306
I'll tell you about our agenda.

337
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,005
It's to have a debate right now!

338
00:18:52,076 --> 00:18:54,629
Get rid of this zero and talk to the hero.

339
00:18:56,812 --> 00:18:58,950
You got time to jog, but not to debate?

340
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:00,448
You can run, but you can't hide.

341
00:19:00,523 --> 00:19:02,116
I thought I told you we won't stop.

342
00:19:02,795 --> 00:19:05,610
What you looking for, the news?
The news is we want to debate!

343
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:08,513
-Why did you change the channel?
-He's scared!

344
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,653
-A word from our sponsor.
-We want to debate!

345
00:19:11,722 --> 00:19:14,755
I thought I told you that we won't stop.

346
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:18,752
Yo, Lewis!

347
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,531
Your mother's ass is so big,
when she sits down she's three feet taller.

348
00:19:23,048 --> 00:19:26,048
Yo, Lewis!
Your mother's got a really big ass!

349
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,607
Sir, it's time we prepare for a debate.

350
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,362
Give me one good reason
I should debate that jerk.

351
00:19:31,431 --> 00:19:33,951
-He talked about your mother!
-So what?

352
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:38,436
Are you going to just let him
talk about me like that?

353
00:19:43,205 --> 00:19:46,980
After some inventive chiding
on the part of Alderman Mays Gilliam...

354
00:19:47,045 --> 00:19:50,590
Vice President Lewis
has finally agreed to one debate...

355
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,152
the night before the election.

356
00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:56,954
So, baby brother, this is it. You ready?

357
00:19:57,923 --> 00:19:59,417
All right, I guess.

358
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:02,174
You guess? You don't know?
You either ready or you ain't.

359
00:20:02,946 --> 00:20:05,335
What's your problem? I'm ready, okay?

360
00:20:05,634 --> 00:20:09,528
No, you ain't. Look at you.
If you call this ready, this won't get it.

361
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:12,318
Dress for the job you want,
not for the job you got.

362
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:14,043
You ain't talking about my clothes.

363
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:16,087
Come on now. This ain't about me.

364
00:20:16,225 --> 00:20:19,836
If I got a good idea, it shouldn't matter
what the hell I'm wearing!

365
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,396
You know you messed up, man.

366
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:24,664
I'm telling you right now.

367
00:20:24,928 --> 00:20:26,837
You know, this ain't about me!

368
00:20:29,631 --> 00:20:31,638
Lewis ain't no punk. He ain't no joke.

369
00:20:31,807 --> 00:20:34,490
That man has been Vice President
for eight years.

370
00:20:34,878 --> 00:20:37,267
He's a war hero.
He's Sharon Stone's cousin.

371
00:20:37,342 --> 00:20:38,748
You better come correct.

372
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:42,104
Yeah? Well, I got us this far!

373
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:45,621
This is as far as you're going to get!

374
00:20:46,109 --> 00:20:48,498
-It's like that?
-That's the way it is.

375
00:20:48,604 --> 00:20:50,775
Geller and them up there
pumping your head up.

376
00:20:50,844 --> 00:20:52,916
But Lewis will smack it back down!

377
00:21:12,377 --> 00:21:13,784
Oh, my God.

378
00:21:14,264 --> 00:21:15,890
Little brother, you all right?

379
00:21:19,672 --> 00:21:21,297
That's what your ass get.

380
00:21:21,368 --> 00:21:24,150
You need anything?
Because it look like you need some help.

381
00:21:24,215 --> 00:21:26,419
You gonna get yours! I'll tell Ma!

382
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:27,697
You better not tell!

383
00:21:33,686 --> 00:21:34,613
Hello?

384
00:21:36,406 --> 00:21:40,977
Don't intrude in my life anymore. I don't
want to have anything to do with you...

385
00:21:41,045 --> 00:21:42,605
not after the way you treated me.

386
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:45,938
I'm sorry I threw you off the bus.
It was wrong.

387
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,240
I couldn't take what you were saying.

388
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:49,551
What do you want?

389
00:21:50,323 --> 00:21:51,567
I want to win.

390
00:21:59,153 --> 00:22:02,982
Welcome to New York City
for the 2004 Presidential Debates.

391
00:22:03,664 --> 00:22:04,679
Where is he?

392
00:22:04,752 --> 00:22:06,824
He was right behind me.
Should I look for him?

393
00:22:06,896 --> 00:22:09,197
-They're getting nervous.
-We've got to do something.

394
00:22:09,264 --> 00:22:10,856
-I can do something.
-No!

395
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:15,498
Ladies and gentlemen,
Vice President Brian Lewis.

396
00:22:26,414 --> 00:22:28,486
Wait. Here they come.

397
00:22:30,797 --> 00:22:31,909
Sweet.

398
00:22:32,877 --> 00:22:34,338
Hello, Martin.

399
00:22:34,572 --> 00:22:37,059
Sorry I'm late. I had to change.

400
00:22:37,132 --> 00:22:40,099
-Mr. Earl, nice to see you.
-Nice to see you too, sir.

401
00:22:40,204 --> 00:22:41,414
Let's move.

402
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:46,915
There are 250 million people out there
deciding who to vote for.

403
00:22:46,986 --> 00:22:49,953
They all know Lewis
didn't want to debate you. Show them why.

404
00:22:50,026 --> 00:22:52,808
-Stay focused.
-Take your time.

405
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:55,720
If he get out of pocket,
put your foot in his ass.

406
00:22:55,881 --> 00:22:57,571
By the way, nice suit.

407
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:01,185
-"Fuh-buh"?
-Fubu.

408
00:23:01,257 --> 00:23:02,817
Even I knew that.

409
00:23:04,264 --> 00:23:08,005
Ladies and gentlemen,
Alderman Mays Gilliam.

410
00:23:20,102 --> 00:23:22,306
Yo, when's Martin coming on, man?

411
00:23:24,805 --> 00:23:26,812
My momma told me to whup your ass.

412
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:36,351
The first question is directed
by coin flip to the Vice President.

413
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:38,622
Vice President Lewis...

414
00:23:38,723 --> 00:23:41,308
what steps should be taken
to limit our youth's access...

415
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:43,037
to violent materials?

416
00:23:43,107 --> 00:23:46,205
Our American children's futures
are at stake here.

417
00:23:46,818 --> 00:23:50,811
We need to study this issue,
and appropriate legislation...

418
00:23:50,882 --> 00:23:53,948
that will return us to an America
we can be proud of.

419
00:23:54,753 --> 00:23:57,273
God bless America, and no place else.

420
00:24:02,016 --> 00:24:05,081
Alderman Gilliam, same question, please.

421
00:24:05,151 --> 00:24:07,834
How do we limit violent material? Turn it off.

422
00:24:08,095 --> 00:24:10,812
And if the kids cut it back on,
knock them out.

423
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:12,285
That's why I don't smoke.

424
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:14,652
When I was a kid,
my daddy caught me smoking...

425
00:24:14,718 --> 00:24:16,212
and he knocked me out!

426
00:24:16,382 --> 00:24:19,643
And to this day, I don't smoke.
Not because I'm scared of cancer.

427
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,058
I don't smoke because I think my dad
is going to walk through that door...

428
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:25,075
and knock me the hell out!

429
00:24:25,437 --> 00:24:27,477
Knock out your kids. It helps.

430
00:24:36,188 --> 00:24:37,748
Vice President Lewis...

431
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:41,560
with over 10,000 gun deaths per year
in the United States...

432
00:24:42,074 --> 00:24:44,659
do you believe we need
stricter gun control laws?

433
00:24:44,762 --> 00:24:46,834
I don't think we need more gun control.

434
00:24:46,906 --> 00:24:49,873
I say we enforce the laws
that are already on the books.

435
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,663
The problem is, nobody reads the books.

436
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:55,630
We need to start putting laws on videos...

437
00:24:55,705 --> 00:24:58,705
because everybody watches videos,
MTV, BET.

438
00:24:58,777 --> 00:25:01,231
We need to put some laws
on the Nelly video.

439
00:25:01,496 --> 00:25:06,165
If you had laws on a Destiny's Child video
right now, you could stop crime.

440
00:25:06,231 --> 00:25:09,646
-We already have gun licensing.
-But that's only to carry the gun.

441
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:11,180
Let the people decide.

442
00:25:11,286 --> 00:25:14,701
The people can't decide. The people
are too busy getting shot in the ass.

443
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:34,797
That's my brother.

444
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,485
That's another reason he's not qualified.

445
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:41,066
Because I had the good sense to pick
my big brother to be my running mate?

446
00:25:41,234 --> 00:25:43,208
I didn't come here to argue with you.

447
00:25:43,282 --> 00:25:46,762
Yes, you did. We're having a debate.
A debate ain't nothing but an argument.

448
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:48,426
A debate isn't an argument.

449
00:25:48,594 --> 00:25:50,666
-Yes, it is.
-No, it isn't.

450
00:25:51,377 --> 00:25:53,482
-Yes, it is.
-No, it isn't.

451
00:25:54,129 --> 00:25:56,136
I know you are, but what am l?

452
00:26:02,992 --> 00:26:05,447
Can we just move on? This is ridiculous.

453
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:06,796
Our next question comes from--

454
00:26:06,863 --> 00:26:07,943
I have a question.

455
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:11,974
Would you like our reception
to be buffet style or formal seating?

456
00:26:12,078 --> 00:26:14,020
If you put Robert next to Nelson...

457
00:26:14,094 --> 00:26:17,061
he'll be very angry
because he wanted to be your best man.

458
00:26:17,134 --> 00:26:18,889
Security.

459
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:20,419
I love you so much--

460
00:26:21,741 --> 00:26:24,424
The candidates have agreed upon
a short closing speech.

461
00:26:24,492 --> 00:26:27,459
Vice President Lewis won the coin toss.

462
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:29,125
He has elected to go first.

463
00:26:29,292 --> 00:26:30,502
Thank you.

464
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:33,410
-No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is!

465
00:26:33,867 --> 00:26:37,249
Tonight you have seen two different men...

466
00:26:37,418 --> 00:26:41,062
with two very different points of view,
battle to win your vote.

467
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:44,168
And this is what America is all about.

468
00:26:45,193 --> 00:26:46,916
As we've seen tonight...

469
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:51,359
Alderman Gilliam
can be captivating and entertaining.

470
00:26:52,168 --> 00:26:55,550
But America needs more than that
from its Commander in Chief.

471
00:26:55,912 --> 00:26:58,814
To lead America, it takes experience.

472
00:26:59,112 --> 00:27:02,373
Now, I've been Vice President
for the last eight years.

473
00:27:02,983 --> 00:27:06,725
I'm a war hero,
and I'm Sharon Stone's cousin.

474
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:11,844
And to me,
America is like a fine performance car.

475
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:15,037
And now is not the time...

476
00:27:15,526 --> 00:27:18,307
to turn this fine vehicle we call America...

477
00:27:18,757 --> 00:27:21,091
over to the hands of an amateur.

478
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:27,453
I'm Brian Lewis, and I am your last chance.

479
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,387
God bless America, and no place else.

480
00:27:36,226 --> 00:27:38,615
Yeah, it's over now.

481
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:41,406
Why do you have to be so negative?

482
00:27:42,338 --> 00:27:43,548
Give me five.

483
00:27:43,618 --> 00:27:44,795
Thank you.

484
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,317
Hold it!

485
00:27:59,423 --> 00:28:02,587
You're right, Vice President Lewis.
I am an amateur.

486
00:28:03,103 --> 00:28:05,175
When it comes to creating
so many enemies...

487
00:28:05,247 --> 00:28:09,272
that we need billions of dollars
to protect ourselves, I'm an amateur.

488
00:28:09,374 --> 00:28:12,123
When it comes to paying farmers
not to grow food...

489
00:28:12,189 --> 00:28:15,505
while people in this country
starve every day, I'm an amateur.

490
00:28:15,581 --> 00:28:19,574
When it comes to creating a drug policy
that makes crack and heroin...

491
00:28:19,645 --> 00:28:22,993
cheaper than asthma and AlDS medicine,
I'm an amateur.

492
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,370
But there's nothing wrong
with being an amateur.

493
00:28:25,436 --> 00:28:28,632
The people that started
the Underground Railroad were amateurs.

494
00:28:28,699 --> 00:28:31,033
Martin Luther King was an amateur.

495
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:33,907
Have you ever been to Amateur Night
at the Apollo?

496
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:36,083
Some of the world's best talent was there:

497
00:28:36,154 --> 00:28:40,464
James Brown, Luther Vandross, Rockwell,
the Crown Heights Affair.

498
00:28:40,538 --> 00:28:43,254
-Hall and Oates!
-The Fat Boys, Rob Base.

499
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,688
But you wouldn't know
nothing about that. Why?

500
00:28:45,753 --> 00:28:48,436
Because when it comes to judging
talent and potential...

501
00:28:48,504 --> 00:28:50,675
you, my friend, are an amateur!

502
00:28:56,056 --> 00:29:00,310
-I believe the Alderman is over his time.
-You had eight years to talk.

503
00:29:00,374 --> 00:29:03,505
Now it's my turn. I'm getting mine!

504
00:29:05,623 --> 00:29:08,011
Ladies and gentlemen,
hold your applause, please.

505
00:29:08,086 --> 00:29:10,704
How can you help the poor
if you never been poor?

506
00:29:10,774 --> 00:29:14,090
How can you stop crime
if you don't know no criminals?

507
00:29:14,165 --> 00:29:18,474
How can you make drug policy
if you never smoked a chronic?

508
00:29:19,413 --> 00:29:21,998
How can you do that? Just a nickel bag!

509
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,270
I'm a real American.

510
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,267
I've been high, I've been robbed,
I've been broke.

511
00:29:28,371 --> 00:29:32,648
My credit is horrible!
They won't even take my cash!

512
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:37,130
You're always talking about,
"God bless America, and no place else."

513
00:29:37,201 --> 00:29:39,852
But isn't it obvious
that God has blessed America?

514
00:29:39,922 --> 00:29:43,369
America is the richest,
most powerful nation on earth.

515
00:29:43,761 --> 00:29:47,917
If America was a woman,
it would be a big-titty woman.

516
00:29:47,984 --> 00:29:50,504
And everybody loves a big-titty woman!

517
00:29:50,896 --> 00:29:52,456
So, in closing...

518
00:29:52,528 --> 00:29:55,113
I'd like to say you are full of shit.

519
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,242
"God bless America, and no place else."

520
00:29:59,311 --> 00:30:02,659
How about "God bless Haiti"
or "God bless Africa"?

521
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,490
How about "God bless Jamaica"?

522
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:08,005
I'm not talking about Jamaica,
the beach tribes you all love.

523
00:30:08,077 --> 00:30:11,786
I'm talking about stabbing Jamaica.
That's what I'm talking about.

524
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:16,555
So, tonight I want to say:
"God bless America, and everybody else!"

525
00:30:17,036 --> 00:30:19,141
The whole world! God bless you!

526
00:30:19,212 --> 00:30:23,521
I'm Mays Gilliam, and I'm running for
President of the United States of America.

527
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:24,869
Ya heard?

528
00:30:46,568 --> 00:30:48,455
Now we can watch Martin!

529
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,061
-Hello?
-Good morning, Mr. President.

530
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:08,802
-What time is it?
-I think it's a little after 7:00.

531
00:31:09,126 --> 00:31:12,475
-Lisa, I need some help in here!
-Will you wait a damn minute?

532
00:31:12,806 --> 00:31:15,871
I was so proud of you.
You were so good last night.

533
00:31:18,053 --> 00:31:22,209
Tonight, no matter what, win or lose,
I want to see you.

534
00:31:22,277 --> 00:31:24,415
I don't know. I might have to work.

535
00:31:24,484 --> 00:31:26,905
But if I don't see you tonight,
I will see you soon.

536
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,940
Just run your race, get out there,
and do what you got to do, okay?

537
00:31:31,107 --> 00:31:33,758
-I'll talk to you later. Bye.
-All right.

538
00:31:34,275 --> 00:31:37,569
It's Election Day, Tuesday,
November 8, 2004.

539
00:31:37,635 --> 00:31:39,423
The stage is set for what will be...

540
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,239
one of the most dramatic campaign finales
of all time.

541
00:31:42,305 --> 00:31:45,753
The question everyone's asking is:
"Who will America vote for?"

542
00:31:46,401 --> 00:31:47,961
I voted for Mays Gilliam.

543
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:50,618
-I voted for big business.
-I voted for Lewis.

544
00:31:50,721 --> 00:31:53,241
Who the fuck you think I'm voting for?

545
00:31:53,664 --> 00:31:55,387
There seems to be an agreement...

546
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:58,717
between Washington, D.C., officials
and transit authority operators...

547
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:01,368
regarding the shutdown
of the 9th Ward bus line.

548
00:32:01,438 --> 00:32:03,991
I don't see how they could do this to us.

549
00:32:04,062 --> 00:32:07,258
People got to make money and get to work.

550
00:32:07,774 --> 00:32:12,508
-Show them how you do it.
-The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire

551
00:32:12,573 --> 00:32:15,672
You're not gonna believe this.
We got the Teamsters!

552
00:32:15,741 --> 00:32:19,318
-That's great, little brother!
-They'll announce it at a press conference.

553
00:32:19,388 --> 00:32:21,908
You just have to go,
shake hands, take photographs...

554
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,671
but it is yours.

555
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,060
What's the matter?

556
00:32:27,131 --> 00:32:30,775
If they shut down this bus service,
I will drive you to work myself.

557
00:32:31,802 --> 00:32:34,322
-I can't do it.
-But it's Election Day!

558
00:32:34,394 --> 00:32:37,111
You have to get the endorsement.
You said you want to win.

559
00:32:37,178 --> 00:32:40,145
You can't snub the Teamsters.
You want them to endorse Lewis?

560
00:32:40,218 --> 00:32:42,868
I'm not worried about Lewis.
I'm running my race.

561
00:32:42,937 --> 00:32:45,304
Go ahead, baby brother. I got this.

562
00:32:47,224 --> 00:32:49,907
-You're just gonna let him go?
-He's a grown man.

563
00:32:49,977 --> 00:32:53,653
They shut down the whole bus line.
What can he do about that?

564
00:33:02,135 --> 00:33:06,258
In the latest exit poll, Vice President Lewis
has 51 percent of the vote.

565
00:33:06,326 --> 00:33:07,951
Bring him back. He got to vote.

566
00:33:08,021 --> 00:33:11,370
...while Mays Gilliam
is posting an impressive 47 percent.

567
00:33:12,566 --> 00:33:14,605
You gotta get to the back of the bus.

568
00:33:14,677 --> 00:33:16,368
I'm just playing. Come on.

569
00:33:16,724 --> 00:33:20,466
Now, he and Vice President Lewis
are in a statistical dead heat.

570
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:21,961
Come on, hoes!

571
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:26,093
While Lewis and Mitch Gilliam
have been working the campaign trail...

572
00:33:26,356 --> 00:33:29,355
Mays Gilliam has been out
driving people to work.

573
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:34,513
Damn it! Why didn't somebody around here
think of this?

574
00:33:34,578 --> 00:33:36,999
Why am I not out there driving a damn bus?

575
00:33:37,073 --> 00:33:40,237
Get me an SUV, a minivan, a bus,
a scooter...

576
00:33:40,305 --> 00:33:42,312
a motorcycle, or a rickshaw.

577
00:33:42,385 --> 00:33:43,791
Get me some wheels, bitch!

578
00:33:45,104 --> 00:33:46,827
Are you going uptown?

579
00:33:48,048 --> 00:33:49,836
Come on. Wait a minute!

580
00:33:51,088 --> 00:33:53,127
We could write our own vows!

581
00:33:53,967 --> 00:33:56,749
I love you, Mays!

582
00:33:58,127 --> 00:34:01,542
With the polls about 30 minutes
from closing on the East Coast...

583
00:34:01,615 --> 00:34:05,127
Mays Gilliam is actually ahead
by several points.

584
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:10,085
There is no question that Lewis has Texas.

585
00:34:11,821 --> 00:34:14,985
It seems clear
Gilliam is going to take New York.

586
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,128
New York!

587
00:34:20,204 --> 00:34:22,178
It's likely Lewis will take Michigan.

588
00:34:23,948 --> 00:34:27,722
It looks like Gilliam
might just pull an upset in lllinois.

589
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:30,858
Illinois!

590
00:34:31,818 --> 00:34:32,746
Go, Mays!

591
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:35,395
This looks like
it may come down to California.

592
00:34:35,466 --> 00:34:37,953
This looks like
it may come down to California.

593
00:34:38,025 --> 00:34:40,414
This looks like
it may come down to California.

594
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:45,597
I need to know. How real is this?
Can we win without California?

595
00:34:45,673 --> 00:34:49,087
We stand a chance if you call
your connections to the energy companies--

596
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,647
No, you can't win without California.

597
00:34:51,784 --> 00:34:53,158
What are you doing here?

598
00:34:53,223 --> 00:34:56,419
Shut up. You want to win,
you'll do what I tell you.

599
00:34:56,807 --> 00:34:59,588
Gilliam has
over 90 percent minority turnout.

600
00:34:59,655 --> 00:35:03,680
Whites are the majority,
but they're not voting. They don't like you.

601
00:35:03,973 --> 00:35:05,915
-I like you, sir.
-Shut up.

602
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,062
How can we turn this around?

603
00:35:08,133 --> 00:35:11,394
There's about one and a half hours left
at the West Coast polls.

604
00:35:11,461 --> 00:35:15,072
If there's a leak saying Gilliam
is going to win, you'll get a late rush.

605
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,823
You get California, you get the election.

606
00:35:18,819 --> 00:35:23,292
It will make the 6:30 news if we do it now.
We just have to put it out there.

607
00:35:23,363 --> 00:35:26,493
-Can we do this?
-We're the government. We can do anything.

608
00:35:27,395 --> 00:35:30,045
The race for President
now turns to the West Coast.

609
00:35:30,114 --> 00:35:32,983
People, Armageddon is upon us
and Big Dave is scared.

610
00:35:33,058 --> 00:35:37,313
If these voting trends sustain,
it's likely that for the first time in history...

611
00:35:37,377 --> 00:35:41,271
a black man will become
President of the United States of America.

612
00:36:15,996 --> 00:36:19,541
"I have a dream that one day...

613
00:36:21,243 --> 00:36:23,512
"this nation will rise up...

614
00:36:24,762 --> 00:36:27,577
"and live out the true meaning of its creed:

615
00:36:28,442 --> 00:36:31,475
"'We hold these truths to be self-evident:

616
00:36:31,706 --> 00:36:33,942
"'that all men are created equal. "'

617
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:35,822
Checkmate.

618
00:36:35,897 --> 00:36:38,199
I, Richard Nixon, do solemnly swear....

619
00:36:38,265 --> 00:36:40,370
I, Ronald Reagan, do solemnly swear....

620
00:36:47,095 --> 00:36:48,851
The race for President is over.

621
00:36:50,327 --> 00:36:51,788
The election is now over.

622
00:36:51,863 --> 00:36:54,132
-The race for President....
-...is over.

623
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,573
The race for President is over.

624
00:36:58,934 --> 00:37:02,828
For the first time in history,
a black man, Mays Gilliam...

625
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:07,218
will be the next President
of the United States of America.

626
00:37:25,586 --> 00:37:27,179
Come here, brother.

627
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,721
-I love you, man!
-I love you, too.

628
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,539
I appreciate it. Thanks a lot.

629
00:37:45,135 --> 00:37:46,412
Thank you.

630
00:37:48,911 --> 00:37:51,693
We won! Aren't you happy?

631
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,085
-Can I have a massage?
-Yes!

632
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:56,267
I won!

633
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:01,291
There is no way in the world
I could have ever done this without you.

634
00:38:01,357 --> 00:38:02,502
You're damn right.

635
00:38:02,573 --> 00:38:05,475
We won! We did it! Yes!

636
00:38:07,309 --> 00:38:09,164
Look at my little brother!

637
00:38:09,229 --> 00:38:12,774
-Boy, I'm proud of you! Mr. President!
-Mr. Vice President.

638
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:17,152
You're the man! You ain't got to worry about
no assassinations or nothing.

639
00:38:17,227 --> 00:38:19,561
They sure don't want me
to be the next President.

640
00:38:19,627 --> 00:38:21,732
You can raise taxes, start a war....

641
00:38:21,803 --> 00:38:23,461
Mays Gilliam began this race....

642
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:26,344
That's my man!

643
00:38:28,202 --> 00:38:29,795
Excuse me, please.

644
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:33,800
-I've been looking for you.
-I was looking for you.

645
00:38:33,865 --> 00:38:36,254
-This is amazing!
-It's amazing.

646
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:38,052
It's incredible.

647
00:38:38,121 --> 00:38:40,128
-What you were up against.
-The odds!

648
00:38:40,201 --> 00:38:43,429
I can't wait to start working,
and do I have a job for you!

649
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:47,908
I don't know what to say. What department
do you want me to work in? Finance?

650
00:38:47,975 --> 00:38:50,910
No, that's not good enough for you.

651
00:38:50,983 --> 00:38:53,284
-Foreign Affairs?
-No, not Foreign Affairs.

652
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:56,416
I thought you could do
something real good in Security!

653
00:38:57,286 --> 00:38:58,496
You suck!

654
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:06,399
We'd like you to run for President.

655
00:39:06,788 --> 00:39:09,952
Sometimes, you don't know
if people like you for you.

656
00:39:10,372 --> 00:39:12,062
I like you for you.

657
00:39:12,324 --> 00:39:13,753
Thanks a lot.

658
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:18,335
Get your hand off my ass, boy!

659
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:20,890
Wait!

660
00:39:24,386 --> 00:39:27,452
Oh, my God, you are everywhere.
Look at you!

661
00:39:29,921 --> 00:39:32,670
What's the first thing
you're going to do, Mr. President?

662
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:35,803
The first thing I'll do
is make you my First Lady.

663
00:39:36,577 --> 00:39:39,162
-Don't you play with me like that.
-I'm not playing.

664
00:39:39,232 --> 00:39:40,377
You can't do that!

665
00:39:40,448 --> 00:39:42,935
I'm the government. I can do anything.

666
00:39:59,006 --> 00:40:00,085
Get ready for...

667
00:40:00,157 --> 00:40:04,019
the 2005 Presidential Inaugural Ball.

668
00:40:04,157 --> 00:40:08,663
Ladies and gentlemen, the President
of the United States of America...

669
00:40:08,732 --> 00:40:12,441
Mays Gilliam, and his future First Wifey...

670
00:40:12,507 --> 00:40:14,001
Lisa Clark!

671
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:27,893
Look at him now, man
Ain't this great

672
00:40:27,961 --> 00:40:30,033
Biggest man in town
He's the head of state

673
00:40:30,105 --> 00:40:32,494
They come from all around
just for one handshake

674
00:40:32,568 --> 00:40:35,634
Look at him now
He's the head of state

675
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:44,242
That's me, Mays Gilliam...

676
00:40:44,343 --> 00:40:47,092
President of the United States of America.

677
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:48,823
North America.

678
00:40:55,669 --> 00:40:57,327
-Who did you vote for?
-For what?

679
00:40:57,397 --> 00:40:58,859
-For President.
-Of what?

680
00:40:58,933 --> 00:41:01,201
-Of the United States.
-Of what?

681
00:41:01,269 --> 00:41:02,927
-Of America.
-What America?

682
00:41:02,997 --> 00:41:04,076
North America.

683
00:41:04,148 --> 00:41:07,050
Slick, I don't vote.
You gonna buy some of this meat, or what?

684
00:41:07,252 --> 00:41:11,561
You can't trust nobody.
Everybody's trying to rob you. Nobody!

685
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:14,001
That guy right there! Don't trust him!

686
00:41:14,067 --> 00:41:15,823
Can't trust no-damn-body!

687
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:18,378
America is taking advantage of you!

688
00:41:18,515 --> 00:41:22,954
You can go to war when you're 18,
but you can't have a drink till you're 21!

689
00:41:23,154 --> 00:41:26,252
-That ain't right!
-Right! So, let me get this straight.

690
00:41:26,321 --> 00:41:28,525
You're 18 years old. You go to war.

691
00:41:28,593 --> 00:41:30,927
You come back. Your leg is chopped off!

692
00:41:30,993 --> 00:41:32,618
You got a damn nub!

693
00:41:32,688 --> 00:41:35,077
Everywhere you go they say,
"What's up, nubby?"

694
00:41:35,152 --> 00:41:38,467
You get to the bar and say,
"Bartender, can I have a drink?"

695
00:41:38,543 --> 00:41:42,088
He looks you up and down and says,
"l got to see some lD."

696
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:46,665
ID? You mean to tell me
a one-legged teenager can't have a drink?

697
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:50,245
-That ain't right!
-Where is the nub?

698
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:54,474
Prescription drugs, I'll lower the prices.
Let me explain something else to you.

699
00:41:54,542 --> 00:41:56,068
You can survive a stroke...

700
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:59,436
but the high prices of medicine
will give you a heart attack.

701
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,078
America is the richest,
most powerful nation on earth.

702
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:07,042
If America was a car, it would be a Bentley...

703
00:42:07,116 --> 00:42:11,393
sitting on chrome doves,
with TVs in the headrests...

704
00:42:11,467 --> 00:42:14,783
and a fine, naked Puerto Rican girl
feeding you grapes!

705
00:42:15,051 --> 00:42:18,465
Ain't nothing better than that!
Ain't nothing ever been better than that!

706
00:42:18,538 --> 00:42:22,531
Most opponents are saying your brother
destroyed any chance of winning...

707
00:42:22,601 --> 00:42:24,641
by naming you as his running mate. Why?

708
00:42:24,713 --> 00:42:27,331
-Why'd your brother make you anchorman?
-I don't have--

709
00:42:27,401 --> 00:42:30,531
You said it was your brother.
I did my homework as well, okay?

710
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,607
You got your job same way I got mine.

711
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,225
-I'm not running for public office.
-I'm not running for anchorman.
