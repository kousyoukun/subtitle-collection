1
00:00:59,473 --> 00:01:01,270
One, two, three....

2
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:02,740
Hold up.

3
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:06,535
Here's the story about a man

4
00:01:07,647 --> 00:01:09,046
A simple man

5
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:13,682
A man with a dream
To do the world some good

6
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,352
Here's a story for rich and poor

7
00:01:17,023 --> 00:01:18,547
For young and for old

8
00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:23,052
About a man from the 'hood
Trying to do the world some good

9
00:01:23,463 --> 00:01:25,590
Here's the story about a man

10
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,933
An everyday man

11
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:31,370
A man with a dream

12
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:33,599
To be the head ofstate

13
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:41,974
Alderman Gilliam's office.
What are you upset about?

14
00:01:42,048 --> 00:01:44,312
It's not a black-owned business?

15
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:47,876
-But it's a Chinese food restaurant.
-So, what's with the fried rice?

16
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:51,082
I know it's fried rice, but it's not "fried" rice.

17
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,149
Alderman Gilliam's office.

18
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:55,524
Kim. How is it going, honey?

19
00:01:55,595 --> 00:01:57,222
-Got tickets to the symphony.
-Really?

20
00:01:57,297 --> 00:02:01,028
-Hold on a second, l got another call.
-You better not put me on hold.

21
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:03,661
Vote for Gaines and James.

22
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:07,571
-The Million Babies Mamas March?
-It's a very good cause.

23
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:10,109
Call Reverend Barton for that one. No...

24
00:02:10,177 --> 00:02:13,704
you can't use food stamps to buy tires.

25
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:17,349
I'm sorry, Mr. Hawkins.
What can l do for you?

26
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:18,884
Your girlfriend is on hold.

27
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:21,216
-Hold on a second.
-How could you put me on hold?

28
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:24,086
-What was it, Mr. Hawkins?
-The bus.

29
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:26,853
I read that they're going to shut down
our bus line.

30
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:29,259
If they do that, l can't get to work!

31
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:32,127
Unless they give me a job
in that new mall they're building.

32
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,929
Don't worry. I've been talking
to the people downtown...

33
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:36,525
and l promise you this:

34
00:02:36,603 --> 00:02:40,266
If they shut down this bus line,
l will drive you to work myself.

35
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,232
You got my word.

36
00:02:43,677 --> 00:02:45,941
Alderman Gilliam, quick! Miss Pearl is back!

37
00:02:46,012 --> 00:02:47,411
Okay. I got to go.

38
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,580
Hi, that's me, Mays Gilliam, aIderman
of the 9th Ward of Washington, D.C.

39
00:02:58,892 --> 00:03:01,224
Not the part of D.C. you're familiar with.

40
00:03:01,294 --> 00:03:05,492
I work in a neighborhood so bad,
you can get shot while you're getting shot.

41
00:03:05,765 --> 00:03:10,099
Around here when people have a problem,
they don't caIl the mayor, they caIl me.

42
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:17,269
Miss Pearl!

43
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:20,537
What's going on?

44
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:26,075
Dionne is in the house. I know she is.

45
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:30,088
I don't know what she's talking about.
We checked the house, nobody is in there.

46
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:32,249
Hey, man, Dionne is her cat.

47
00:03:32,325 --> 00:03:34,987
Whatever. Cats got nine lives. She'll be fine.

48
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:37,894
Can we let one guy go in
and help this lady get her cat?

49
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:41,297
Can't do it. Once they laid the explosives,
there's nothing l can do.

50
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:42,426
She just showed up.

51
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:45,630
You took the lady's house.
Can you at least let her get her cat?

52
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:47,764
We didn't take it, we gave her $40,000.

53
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:51,641
What kind of house is she supposed to get
with $40,000? A crack house?

54
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:53,941
I think she'd be happy to get out
of this rattrap.

55
00:03:54,014 --> 00:03:56,539
Who are you to call this place a rattrap?

56
00:03:56,616 --> 00:04:00,882
This is my neighborhood, where l'm from.
I got my first bike stolen right there.

57
00:04:00,954 --> 00:04:03,115
My daddy got his bike stolen right there.

58
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:07,285
When l have a son, l hope he's fortunate
enough to get stuck up right there.

59
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,056
-Can't you let somebody go check?
-We already looked.

60
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,360
There's nothing in there. We got work to do.

61
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:14,161
Leave the people alone, damn it!

62
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:15,997
-Let's get this thing going.
-Come on.

63
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:18,867
-Stop being in such a hurry.
-We've been here all morning.

64
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:20,839
Let the lady go inside.

65
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:23,808
Come on, baby! Sugar baby.

66
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:27,409
Could you at least turn it off?
Let the lady get her cat.

67
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,881
Dionne, baby? l got something for you!

68
00:04:32,986 --> 00:04:34,283
Miss Pearl, no!

69
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,087
All right, turn it off.
Wait till this woman gets her cat.

70
00:04:40,193 --> 00:04:41,683
Shit, it's not working!

71
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:42,921
Turn it off!

72
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,796
She better get out, it's going to blow!

73
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:48,533
Miss Pearl! Come out!

74
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:50,725
No, Mays!

75
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:54,134
You've only got a minute!

76
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,103
-Fix it! Get to work.
-I'm trying.

77
00:04:59,512 --> 00:05:01,002
Get a union man on this.

78
00:05:01,548 --> 00:05:03,140
Get your ass out!

79
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:10,180
Miss Pearl, we got to get out of here.
They're going to blow this place up.

80
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:14,260
They wouldn't do that, baby!
They know we're in here.

81
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:18,525
I love you, l've known you a long time.
You've seen a lot in your life.

82
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:21,590
You've seen churches burnt to the ground,
dogs sicced on kids...

83
00:05:21,668 --> 00:05:23,898
you've seen Malcolm X and JFK killed.

84
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,029
They shut up Muhammad Ali
and Richard Pryor.

85
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:28,802
They gave Magic Johnson AIDS,
turned Michael Jackson white.

86
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:32,174
Do you really think these people
give a damn about you?

87
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:57,035
We interrupt the Jay-Z song
to bring you this speciaI bulletin.

88
00:05:57,112 --> 00:05:59,205
PresidentiaI candidate Senator Gaines...

89
00:05:59,281 --> 00:06:01,215
and his running mate,
GeneraI Olson James...

90
00:06:01,283 --> 00:06:04,275
were both killed when their planes
crashed into each other.

91
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:07,481
We now return you to the Jay-Z song
aIready in progress.

92
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,364
What's up?

93
00:06:27,442 --> 00:06:30,775
Trying to be like you, hero!
What's up, man? Saving kittens?

94
00:06:30,846 --> 00:06:32,279
Don't steal my car now.

95
00:06:32,347 --> 00:06:36,408
I don't want that garbage.
What will l do, feed your car to my car?

96
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:41,082
Let me get ten Nine Lives,
four Lucky Ducks, two Straight Pokers...

97
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,317
three Crabpots and five Powerballs.

98
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:45,992
Thank you, here you go.

99
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:53,193
You all need to stop.

100
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,571
Why are all these people clapping?

101
00:07:00,642 --> 00:07:03,236
-You didn't see me on the news?
-No, l didn't.

102
00:07:03,412 --> 00:07:05,380
I got meat!

103
00:07:05,514 --> 00:07:09,143
More beef than East Coast, West Coast rap.
Check it out!

104
00:07:10,152 --> 00:07:12,416
Superman! Saving lives and stuff.

105
00:07:12,487 --> 00:07:14,717
Why don't you cop
one of these pork chops?

106
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,021
Know what you need to do?
You need to leave. I won't tell you again.

107
00:07:18,093 --> 00:07:21,426
Nobody wants your meat.
Who the hell wants to buy stolen meat?

108
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:23,896
-I'll take a T-bone.
-You like gizzards, too?

109
00:07:26,802 --> 00:07:29,532
Did you hear about that guy
running for President?

110
00:07:29,605 --> 00:07:31,232
Who will replace him?

111
00:07:31,306 --> 00:07:34,207
Maybe they should get Shaq.
Nobody can beat him.

112
00:07:34,276 --> 00:07:36,676
Are you getting gas?
You're holding my line up.

113
00:07:36,745 --> 00:07:38,110
Yeah, l'm sorry.

114
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:40,041
$10 on three.

115
00:07:50,692 --> 00:07:53,160
You've got a lot of nerve hanging up on me.

116
00:07:53,228 --> 00:07:54,354
Hanging up?

117
00:07:54,496 --> 00:07:57,761
-What's going on?
-I'm leaving you! That's what's going on.

118
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:01,667
The only reason l accepted this engagement
ring from you in the first place...

119
00:08:01,737 --> 00:08:04,604
is because l thought you had potential!

120
00:08:04,673 --> 00:08:06,937
I thought you wanted more!

121
00:08:07,242 --> 00:08:10,643
Why can't you just play the game?
Wear a suit!

122
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:12,811
Be a real politician!

123
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:16,180
What's my clothes have to do with....
Are you seeing somebody else?

124
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:18,276
I'm seeing everybody else!

125
00:08:19,154 --> 00:08:21,987
I've met mosquitoes
with more force than you.

126
00:08:22,057 --> 00:08:26,016
I'm tired of your little games,
tired of being your little secretary.

127
00:08:26,094 --> 00:08:28,187
Here's the light bill. I didn't pay it.

128
00:08:28,263 --> 00:08:30,697
Here's the cable bill. I didn't pay that, either.

129
00:08:30,766 --> 00:08:33,394
And here's the bill for your car note.

130
00:08:33,702 --> 00:08:35,465
I hope they take it!

131
00:08:36,238 --> 00:08:38,468
Wait a minute, that's my car!

132
00:08:38,774 --> 00:08:40,241
Wait, come back!

133
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:44,171
I hate that piece of shit!

134
00:08:45,213 --> 00:08:49,172
I'm tired of spending my time
waiting for you to quit acting like a child...

135
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:52,550
and act like a grown man
for a change, Mays!

136
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:54,789
I need to get on with my life!

137
00:08:54,856 --> 00:08:57,188
I want a house, l want children!

138
00:08:57,259 --> 00:09:00,387
I want to go on vacation!
You're horrible in bed!

139
00:09:00,996 --> 00:09:03,897
I am tired of being engaged.
I am tired of being--

140
00:09:08,136 --> 00:09:10,661
I wish you would.

141
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,578
For the last time,
l'm not running for President.

142
00:09:17,646 --> 00:09:21,707
I'm not crazy! Gaines was 20 points behind.
It's ten weeks to Election Day.

143
00:09:21,783 --> 00:09:22,943
Damn it!

144
00:09:23,151 --> 00:09:26,780
They should have known better
than to talk on a cell phone in a plane.

145
00:09:26,855 --> 00:09:29,119
-What about Sanderson?
-That's a joke.

146
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:31,455
Lewis has been Vice-President
for eight years.

147
00:09:31,526 --> 00:09:34,154
He's a war hero and Sharon Stone's cousin.
He can't lose.

148
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:35,924
-What about Mosley?
-Girls.

149
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:37,157
-Connelly?
-Boys.

150
00:09:37,232 --> 00:09:39,063
-McMasters?
-Big boys.

151
00:09:39,134 --> 00:09:41,500
So we concede the election to Lewis?

152
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:45,631
Nobody is talking about conceding,
Debra, but let's get real here.

153
00:09:45,807 --> 00:09:47,399
We'll lose this one.

154
00:09:48,076 --> 00:09:51,637
The thing to do is to set the party up
for the next election.

155
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:54,907
We need a candidate
that will put on a good show.

156
00:09:54,983 --> 00:09:58,384
This isn't a circus,
it's a presidential election.

157
00:09:58,954 --> 00:10:00,945
You can't just pick some guy...

158
00:10:01,623 --> 00:10:03,853
to run for President.

159
00:10:03,925 --> 00:10:07,190
It's unprecedented,
but if l put in a call to the party chairman...

160
00:10:07,262 --> 00:10:09,457
we find a candidate, he'll back him.

161
00:10:09,998 --> 00:10:12,330
Who will run a race
they know they can't win?

162
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,867
Who says he has to know?

163
00:10:22,644 --> 00:10:23,804
What the....

164
00:10:35,257 --> 00:10:36,519
What now?

165
00:10:40,328 --> 00:10:41,920
No, not my bike!

166
00:10:47,836 --> 00:10:50,805
When l went in there
l wasn't thinking about being a hero.

167
00:10:50,872 --> 00:10:53,136
I wasjust trying to help Miss Pearl.

168
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,539
Miss Pearl.

169
00:10:55,177 --> 00:10:56,906
I think we found our man.

170
00:10:57,445 --> 00:10:59,276
Look at this! This is great!

171
00:10:59,548 --> 00:11:01,539
This is America, see?

172
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:05,146
Little guy against the big guy,
corporations against the people.

173
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,120
Young versus old. What's better than this?

174
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:08,986
Give me a break!

175
00:11:09,191 --> 00:11:11,716
I am going to run an alderman
for President?

176
00:11:12,894 --> 00:11:14,691
He's not an alderman.

177
00:11:14,963 --> 00:11:16,362
He's a hero.

178
00:11:17,365 --> 00:11:20,425
-Who doesn't like a hero?
-Big business loves a hero!

179
00:11:20,502 --> 00:11:21,662
See?

180
00:11:21,736 --> 00:11:24,136
You said we needed somebody
who can help the party.

181
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:27,039
Now, how in the hell
does this guy help the party?

182
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:28,676
I'm glad you asked.

183
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:31,802
The United States is changing.
America is changing.

184
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,973
Inside of 20 years, you know the numbers...

185
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:37,951
20 percent black,
21 percent Asian, 39 percent Hispanic.

186
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:42,183
The minorities will be the majority.
The smartest thing we can do...

187
00:11:42,357 --> 00:11:46,794
is be the first party
to nominate a minority for President.

188
00:11:46,995 --> 00:11:49,793
-How about a cripple?
-I don't think so, Charlie.

189
00:11:50,332 --> 00:11:54,462
Now, we'll lose, of course,
but the minorities will be happy.

190
00:11:54,936 --> 00:11:59,600
The minorities will be happy
and they will vote for us in 2008...

191
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:01,605
because we've shown we support them.

192
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:04,270
And the white people will vote for us...

193
00:12:04,646 --> 00:12:07,171
-because our guy isn't black.
-You got my vote!

194
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:10,741
Geller, see if you can track down
this Mays Gilliam.

195
00:12:13,054 --> 00:12:14,919
Go check our accounts.

196
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:27,966
Give me one good reason
why l should go along with this.

197
00:12:28,036 --> 00:12:31,870
Don't you get it, Debra?
l intend to run for President in 2008.

198
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:37,003
Now give me one reason why you shouldn't.

199
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:42,980
He would take a lot of work.

200
00:12:43,385 --> 00:12:45,353
We can run a background check...

201
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,615
but it's obvious
he's not a party line candidate.

202
00:12:47,689 --> 00:12:50,385
He's just some kid
who thinks he can make a difference.

203
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,325
Don't worry. Go out there,
put the machine behind him.

204
00:12:53,395 --> 00:12:56,330
You get 25 points in the polls,
consider it a win.

205
00:12:56,831 --> 00:12:58,924
Make sure he doesn't embarrass us.

206
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,594
After this is over, we get to work.

207
00:13:02,971 --> 00:13:06,270
When l'm President, l'll take care of you.

208
00:13:08,643 --> 00:13:10,804
Help me. They locked me out of my office.

209
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,609
I know. The mayor is fed up with you.

210
00:13:14,816 --> 00:13:18,047
How many times have l told you?
You got to quit trying to fix shit.

211
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:21,247
I could've got you into the council
next term. Now you're red-lined.

212
00:13:21,323 --> 00:13:23,086
Shannon is taking over your district.

213
00:13:23,158 --> 00:13:26,616
They need to smooth over the mall
situation, that bus thing is heating up.

214
00:13:26,695 --> 00:13:29,721
-They don't trust you.
-I'm not the one stealing people's houses.

215
00:13:29,798 --> 00:13:32,892
That's what your problem is.
You got to work with us.

216
00:13:33,902 --> 00:13:36,530
That shit you pulled over there
cost the city money.

217
00:13:36,604 --> 00:13:38,595
Makes the mayor look bad.

218
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,536
Now, contrary to popular belief,
politics is no place to express yourself.

219
00:13:43,745 --> 00:13:45,906
You want to get in, you got to fit in.

220
00:13:46,047 --> 00:13:48,982
And look at you.
Grow up, you got to dress better.

221
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,678
Even Puff Daddy wears a suit to court.

222
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:57,051
I'm sorry, brother, but ain't nothing l can do.

223
00:14:00,662 --> 00:14:02,823
-Nice car.
-Ain't it, though?

224
00:14:02,931 --> 00:14:05,456
Got it for a song at a repo auction.

225
00:14:28,223 --> 00:14:30,657
He feels bad, mighty low

226
00:14:30,725 --> 00:14:32,556
Got nowhere to go

227
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:35,327
What can you do when you're feeling low

228
00:14:35,397 --> 00:14:37,388
Man, l want to know

229
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:41,499
He feels bad, mighty low
Got nowhere to go

230
00:14:41,836 --> 00:14:44,964
What can you do when you're feeling low

231
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,774
And your carjust got repo'd

232
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:18,202
Here we are.

233
00:15:18,371 --> 00:15:20,566
Mays Gilliam, Debra Lassiter.

234
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,438
Nice to meet you. Take a seat.

235
00:15:30,182 --> 00:15:33,276
We know what happened today.
We know you lost your job.

236
00:15:34,654 --> 00:15:36,645
How do you know that? lt just happened.

237
00:15:36,722 --> 00:15:39,122
We're the government. We know everything.

238
00:15:39,926 --> 00:15:42,156
We'd like you to do something for us.

239
00:15:42,228 --> 00:15:45,755
Sure, l'd love to work
on a presidential campaign.

240
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:48,894
I'll make phone calls, send out fliers.

241
00:15:49,602 --> 00:15:52,093
Who have you guys chosen
to run against Lewis?

242
00:15:52,171 --> 00:15:55,038
That's exactly what we wanted
to talk to you about.

243
00:15:55,241 --> 00:15:58,506
We'd like you to run for President.

244
00:16:05,251 --> 00:16:08,118
-Of what?
-The United States.

245
00:16:09,088 --> 00:16:11,113
-Of what?
-Of America

246
00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:12,513
Which America?

247
00:16:12,592 --> 00:16:13,820
North...

248
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,921
America, Mays.

249
00:16:16,128 --> 00:16:17,720
Get out of here!

250
00:16:18,097 --> 00:16:19,655
We're not joking.

251
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:23,491
We want you to be the nominee
for the office of President...

252
00:16:23,569 --> 00:16:25,901
of the United States of America

253
00:16:31,277 --> 00:16:33,108
Let me get this straight.

254
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:37,081
You guys couldn't find anybody else to run?
You couldn't find nobody?

255
00:16:37,283 --> 00:16:38,773
Something is wrong here.

256
00:16:38,851 --> 00:16:40,944
You couldn't find a congressman...

257
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,648
a senator? l'm just an alderman.

258
00:16:43,756 --> 00:16:47,556
Congressmen, senators,
they work with other politicians.

259
00:16:47,994 --> 00:16:50,622
You're an alderman.
You work with the people.

260
00:16:50,696 --> 00:16:54,097
And that's what we want,
a man of the people.

261
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,861
This is a big joke, right?

262
00:16:55,935 --> 00:16:58,028
They've got a hidden camera somewhere.

263
00:16:58,104 --> 00:17:01,437
You all will get a big laugh out of this.
You know what? l don't care.

264
00:17:01,507 --> 00:17:04,965
One of you all will drive me home
because my bike is messed up.

265
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:07,102
You an American?

266
00:17:09,548 --> 00:17:12,073
-Are you an American?
-Yes.

267
00:17:13,653 --> 00:17:16,349
This isn't just an election. It's a moment.

268
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:20,013
This is the moment when you have
the opportunity to show boys and girls...

269
00:17:20,092 --> 00:17:22,424
men and women, what America is about.

270
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:24,896
Look at that.

271
00:17:26,232 --> 00:17:31,101
When l see that, l think of our forefathers
fighting to make this country what it is.

272
00:17:31,771 --> 00:17:36,435
When l see it l think about the guy who has
to scrub Lincoln's balls for minimum wage.

273
00:17:37,076 --> 00:17:40,637
That's why we want you.
You care about the little people.

274
00:17:41,514 --> 00:17:42,879
What will it be?

275
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:00,794
It gives me great honor...

276
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:03,331
to accept the party's nomination...

277
00:18:03,436 --> 00:18:04,869
for President...

278
00:18:04,937 --> 00:18:07,804
of the United States ofAmerica.

279
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:09,630
No!

280
00:18:16,457 --> 00:18:19,085
Welcome to your campaign headquarters.

281
00:18:19,593 --> 00:18:23,120
These folks will do everything they can
to help you get elected.

282
00:18:23,297 --> 00:18:24,958
These are your people.

283
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:28,034
Here. Let's take a look at this.

284
00:18:28,102 --> 00:18:30,798
Mark, is that cued up? Roll it, please.

285
00:18:38,512 --> 00:18:40,605
This is a great spot.

286
00:18:41,715 --> 00:18:46,015
Ifyou love America,
vote Mays Gilliam for President.

287
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:52,423
But l'm not in it.

288
00:18:53,394 --> 00:18:54,759
You don't even see my face.

289
00:18:54,828 --> 00:18:57,058
It's a template.
We'll get you in there eventually.

290
00:18:57,131 --> 00:18:59,622
There's a couple of people
l want you to meet.

291
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,669
This is your security director, Mr. Earl.

292
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,432
-You'll be in good hands.
-Pleased to meet you, sir.

293
00:19:05,506 --> 00:19:09,772
If you're in trouble, yell "Security!"
and my people will handle the situation.

294
00:19:09,944 --> 00:19:13,345
This is your decoy, Mays Junior.
He enters events before you.

295
00:19:13,414 --> 00:19:16,247
If anything'll happen to you,
it'll happen to him first.

296
00:19:16,317 --> 00:19:18,478
Tupac could have used a guy like you.

297
00:19:18,552 --> 00:19:22,989
This is Nicollette White, she's
your executive director of lnternal Liaisons.

298
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:25,423
Call me Nikki.
It will be a pleasure to serve you.

299
00:19:25,492 --> 00:19:28,620
I'm available to you around the clock,
just let me know.

300
00:19:29,897 --> 00:19:33,128
-What does she do?
-She sleeps with you.

301
00:19:33,634 --> 00:19:36,034
We got tired of getting caught up
in sex scandals...

302
00:19:36,103 --> 00:19:38,765
so we commissioned
our own team of super whores.

303
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:40,500
You call yourself whores!

304
00:19:40,574 --> 00:19:42,508
Move that fat ass! One, two, three!

305
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,774
-These girls are good.
-Good morning, Mays.

306
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,973
I took the liberty of choosing some options
for this evening's fundraiser.

307
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,376
You don't mind, do you?

308
00:19:51,452 --> 00:19:54,853
I'll wear whatever you need me to wear.
What fundraiser is this?

309
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:57,891
Your coming out party.
Campaigns cost money.

310
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,324
The people you meet tonight
have plenty of it.

311
00:20:00,394 --> 00:20:02,419
Geller and l will advance the party...

312
00:20:02,496 --> 00:20:05,226
and Mr. Earl will bring you at 8:00 sharp.

313
00:20:05,499 --> 00:20:08,900
Here are your off-the-cuff remarks.
Learn them. See you later.

314
00:20:17,587 --> 00:20:20,283
Remember, sir, just nod and move.
Nod and move.

315
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,289
What do you plan to do about taxes?

316
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,851
Do you plan to support
paternal leave incentives?

317
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:28,988
Get my demo to somebody. Anybody.

318
00:20:29,699 --> 00:20:32,497
Don't take unscreened packages.
Security reasons.

319
00:20:33,436 --> 00:20:35,802
You have some people to talk to.
Tomorrow, work.

320
00:20:35,872 --> 00:20:38,363
Tonight, smile, shake hands,
and be nice to the wives.

321
00:20:38,441 --> 00:20:41,877
I'll double-check the PA system.
You'll make a brief statement at 1 1 :00.

322
00:20:41,944 --> 00:20:43,172
Let's go.

323
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:54,881
Hi, how are you doing? All right.
You all right.

324
00:20:57,927 --> 00:21:00,725
-I wish you luck, sir.
-Arigatou.

325
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:07,160
It's like Timberland,
and l got a bit of Missy moving up there...

326
00:21:07,236 --> 00:21:09,830
but l'm trying to go through
that Neptune feel--

327
00:21:09,906 --> 00:21:12,238
Excuse me, the Teamsters are here.

328
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,600
What are you doing talking to the help?

329
00:21:14,677 --> 00:21:16,770
Gentlemen, Mr. Mays Gilliam.

330
00:21:16,846 --> 00:21:20,543
Guys, l'm all for labor, l'm all for unions.

331
00:21:20,616 --> 00:21:23,244
But you know and l know
that you will endorse Lewis.

332
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:25,879
It's business.
We'll do what's best for the union.

333
00:21:25,955 --> 00:21:28,822
-Have you decided on a running mate?
-We're thinking about it.

334
00:21:28,891 --> 00:21:32,520
-You should consider Sanders.
-We're considering several options.

335
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,522
Excuse me.

336
00:21:35,765 --> 00:21:36,959
Well, that depends.

337
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:38,625
What's up with this guy?

338
00:21:38,701 --> 00:21:41,101
Track four. Check out track four.

339
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,709
What do you have there?

340
00:21:48,778 --> 00:21:51,872
We got shrimp puffs and cheese snacks...

341
00:21:51,948 --> 00:21:55,076
-just some finger foods.
-Thought that was you.

342
00:21:55,418 --> 00:21:57,784
So what's up with the two jobs? Bad credit?

343
00:21:57,853 --> 00:22:02,290
Why do l have to have bad credit?
Can't l be saving up for a car or for school?

344
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:04,918
Maybe l like to work? Excuse me.

345
00:22:05,761 --> 00:22:08,457
I'm sorry. You know what?
l never got your name.

346
00:22:09,966 --> 00:22:13,333
Hey, Lisa Clark. Mays.
Why you being so rude, Lisa Clark?

347
00:22:13,402 --> 00:22:15,427
I am not being rude, l am working.

348
00:22:15,504 --> 00:22:18,268
We can't mingle with the guests.
Plus, l don't know you.

349
00:22:18,341 --> 00:22:20,969
-You know me.
-No, l don't know you.

350
00:22:21,043 --> 00:22:22,169
But you know me.

351
00:22:22,244 --> 00:22:25,077
You've come to the gas station
a couple of times...

352
00:22:25,147 --> 00:22:27,843
and l see you, but l don't know you.

353
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:29,544
Let's get to know each other.

354
00:22:29,618 --> 00:22:31,245
-Let's dance.
-I have to work.

355
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,416
I know you're working. I'm working, too.
So let's keep working. Want to dance?

356
00:22:35,491 --> 00:22:37,482
Okay, you'll get me in trouble.

357
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:47,602
I cannot believe
you got me out here like this.

358
00:22:47,803 --> 00:22:50,465
-Yeah, but you like it, right?
-A little.

359
00:22:58,581 --> 00:23:00,105
I'm feeling it.

360
00:23:11,894 --> 00:23:13,589
Go ahead, girl, work it!

361
00:23:25,775 --> 00:23:29,006
Oh, my God. I'm having too much fun.
I got to get back to work.

362
00:23:29,078 --> 00:23:30,739
No, come on, stay!

363
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,606
Come on!

364
00:23:35,584 --> 00:23:38,314
Come on, brother,
l know you know how to do this dance.

365
00:23:38,387 --> 00:23:39,752
No, sorry, l don't.

366
00:23:39,822 --> 00:23:42,985
I know you know
how to do the Electric Slide.

367
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:45,787
No, l can't say that l do.

368
00:23:46,629 --> 00:23:48,494
Get your ass in there!

369
00:23:53,402 --> 00:23:56,098
-What the hell is this?
-Where's Mays?

370
00:23:58,808 --> 00:23:59,934
Over there.

371
00:24:01,377 --> 00:24:03,140
-Oh, my God!
-We've got to stop him.

372
00:24:03,212 --> 00:24:04,611
Excuse us, please.

373
00:24:05,648 --> 00:24:09,675
I am getting so hot
l am gonna take my clothes off

374
00:24:09,752 --> 00:24:12,380
-What do you think you're doing?
-Stop it.

375
00:24:12,888 --> 00:24:15,413
I'm just trying to get the party started.

376
00:24:16,725 --> 00:24:18,750
Throw your hands in the air

377
00:24:18,828 --> 00:24:20,955
And wave them like youjust don't care

378
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,225
And if l got your vote for President

379
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:25,494
Let me hear you say, "Oh, yeah"

380
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,195
Shake that ass, Grandma!

381
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:32,903
Let me see you bounce!

382
00:24:33,476 --> 00:24:34,773
Bounce!

383
00:24:35,544 --> 00:24:38,104
We got a couple of freaks over there.

384
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:42,483
Let me see you shake!

385
00:24:45,121 --> 00:24:46,486
Crip walk!

386
00:24:57,266 --> 00:24:59,291
The roof is on fire!

387
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:01,968
No, it's a saying!

388
00:25:04,974 --> 00:25:06,874
It's just a saying. Come back!

389
00:25:09,645 --> 00:25:13,775
You turned the party out.
I have never seen anything like that.

390
00:25:13,883 --> 00:25:16,078
Great party. Too bad about the fire.

391
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,948
-So, where are you off to now?
-I'm not even sure.

392
00:25:21,023 --> 00:25:24,390
We start campaigning tomorrow.
We'll be all over the country.

393
00:25:25,427 --> 00:25:26,621
Need a ride home?

394
00:25:26,695 --> 00:25:29,994
I still have to clean up.
I don't know how long that will take me.

395
00:25:30,065 --> 00:25:31,532
I could wait.

396
00:25:32,134 --> 00:25:35,160
Are you sure?
l could send a car to pick you up.

397
00:25:35,237 --> 00:25:37,364
No, thanks, but l got to go.

398
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:39,134
It was good seeing you again.

399
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:41,870
You too, buddy, old pal.

400
00:25:43,412 --> 00:25:45,937
-Can l get a good-night kiss?
-No.

401
00:25:47,383 --> 00:25:49,476
-I'm coming!
-She's coming!

402
00:25:50,152 --> 00:25:54,418
I got to go. Good luck,
and call me if you get a chance.

403
00:25:57,026 --> 00:25:58,755
Didn't you see me talking?

404
00:25:59,261 --> 00:26:01,195
What kind of display was that?

405
00:26:01,263 --> 00:26:02,992
I was getting the party started.

406
00:26:03,065 --> 00:26:06,193
If the party needs to get started,
l'll handle it.

407
00:26:06,602 --> 00:26:08,570
Just do what we say.

408
00:26:08,637 --> 00:26:11,868
I don't think everybody appreciated
what you did in there.

409
00:26:11,941 --> 00:26:13,636
We really had a great time.

410
00:26:13,709 --> 00:26:15,836
It was off the hizzle for shizzle.

411
00:26:16,712 --> 00:26:19,306
-They liked it.
-I don't care what they liked.

412
00:26:19,515 --> 00:26:21,142
Mays, darling!

413
00:26:26,155 --> 00:26:29,647
Darling, are you done yet?
No? lf not, it's okay. I can wait.

414
00:26:29,725 --> 00:26:32,990
But if we hurry,
we'll be able to get a table at Jezebel's.

415
00:26:34,363 --> 00:26:36,524
Good evening. We're getting married.

416
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:38,695
I'm exhausted.

417
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:40,832
Know what l can't decide?

418
00:26:40,903 --> 00:26:43,997
I can't decide whether we should have
a DJ or a band.

419
00:26:46,108 --> 00:26:47,370
Security!

420
00:27:02,739 --> 00:27:05,970
Thank you for inviting me
to the land of milk and honey.

421
00:27:06,043 --> 00:27:08,170
It's you people, the dairy people...

422
00:27:08,245 --> 00:27:11,078
people that make eggs, milk, cheese...

423
00:27:11,148 --> 00:27:14,242
butter, bacon, that make the country great.

424
00:27:14,418 --> 00:27:17,854
Milk makes the body good,
and you make the country good.

425
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:25,185
Thank you for inviting me
to Memphis, Tennessee.

426
00:27:25,996 --> 00:27:28,988
It's people like you, the church people...

427
00:27:29,132 --> 00:27:33,228
who are the backbone
and the spirit of this great land of ours.

428
00:27:34,771 --> 00:27:38,798
I love the Lord,
and l love the King, Elvis Presley.

429
00:27:42,646 --> 00:27:46,946
I want to thank you for inviting me
to the Lone Star State.

430
00:27:49,152 --> 00:27:50,619
Home of the cowboys!

431
00:27:51,855 --> 00:27:53,482
How about them Cowboys?

432
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:57,018
It's people like you, the ranchers...

433
00:27:57,294 --> 00:27:59,558
who are the backbone of this country.

434
00:28:00,998 --> 00:28:04,661
Now, before l go,
l got one more thing to say:

435
00:28:05,902 --> 00:28:09,269
The stars at night are big and bright

436
00:28:09,873 --> 00:28:12,364
Deep in the heart of Texas

437
00:28:16,313 --> 00:28:17,302
It's not bad.

438
00:28:17,381 --> 00:28:19,679
Will l get another speech anytime soon?

439
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,513
What's the matter with this speech?

440
00:28:21,585 --> 00:28:24,986
I should be talking about something
a little more relevant.

441
00:28:25,389 --> 00:28:26,413
Relevant?

442
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,857
People would be cheering
if l read the recipe for corn bread.

443
00:28:29,926 --> 00:28:32,394
It's not working.
I'm only one point up in the polls.

444
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:36,125
Don't worry about the polls.
They're just a sampling. Polls change.

445
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:37,723
Don't get ahead of yourself.

446
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:40,668
We're here to help.
The people really like you.

447
00:28:40,737 --> 00:28:44,138
Cheer up, we'll be in Chicago in a few days.
You got a brother there.

448
00:28:44,207 --> 00:28:46,607
Then the people will find out
what you're all about.

449
00:28:46,676 --> 00:28:49,372
Yeah, but l don't even know
what l'm all about.

450
00:28:56,293 --> 00:29:00,286
In the latest polls, Mays Gilliam is up
just one point, to 10 percent.

451
00:29:00,497 --> 00:29:03,989
Vice President Brian Lewis
still holds a commanding 84 percent.

452
00:29:04,067 --> 00:29:06,035
Six percent are undecided, saying...

453
00:29:06,103 --> 00:29:09,869
they don't know who they're voting for,
theyjust know it's not Gilliam.

454
00:29:10,107 --> 00:29:12,667
When you get out there, listen to the crowd.

455
00:29:12,743 --> 00:29:16,338
Talk to them, make it look like
you believe in what you're saying.

456
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:19,709
I know we haven't exactly
always seen eye to eye...

457
00:29:19,783 --> 00:29:21,944
but this is very important.

458
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:24,715
-I can't stress that enough.
-Alderman Gilliam?

459
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:28,654
There's a Mitch Gilliam outside.
He says he's your brother.

460
00:29:29,326 --> 00:29:30,486
Send him in.

461
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:35,797
Tonight, America will get
its first impressions of Mays Gilliam.

462
00:29:35,866 --> 00:29:38,562
You know what they say
about first impressions.

463
00:29:41,204 --> 00:29:44,571
Look at my little brother!
You said you'd call when you got here.

464
00:29:44,675 --> 00:29:47,576
I was trying to call you,
but l've been doing press all day.

465
00:29:47,644 --> 00:29:49,908
My little brother, running for President.

466
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,074
Let me introduce you to Martin Geller,
Debra Lassiter.

467
00:29:53,216 --> 00:29:57,653
What's happening, baby? Thanks for what
you're doing for my brother. Appreciate it.

468
00:29:57,721 --> 00:29:59,586
How about you, thriller? What's going--

469
00:29:59,656 --> 00:30:02,284
Nice to meet you.
What do you do for a living?

470
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,757
I'm a bail bondsman.
I got an office on the Southside.

471
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,060
-Bail bondsman.
-Yes, sir.

472
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:16,901
How's business?

473
00:30:16,974 --> 00:30:19,374
I tell you how business is.
Business is great.

474
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:21,206
Thank God for crime.

475
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,474
Thank God for crime.
Could you give us a minute?

476
00:30:28,018 --> 00:30:29,110
Five.

477
00:30:31,555 --> 00:30:33,216
Nice. Real nice.

478
00:30:33,724 --> 00:30:37,057
Look at you, man!
l see you all on the shows, politicking.

479
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,561
You like the way your campaign is going?

480
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,096
Look at this.

481
00:30:41,732 --> 00:30:45,429
Let me ask you something, brother.
When they gonna let you speak?

482
00:30:45,502 --> 00:30:48,096
I've been talking all day.
I was talking to the press.

483
00:30:48,171 --> 00:30:51,572
You been talking, but when they gonna
let you speak your mind?

484
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,508
This ain't you. You gonna say this shit?
This shit is booty.

485
00:30:54,578 --> 00:30:58,378
Say this if you want to, watch that man
come sweep your butt off stage.

486
00:30:58,582 --> 00:31:02,109
Look at this poster: "Mays."
Who are they talking about? Willie?

487
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:03,612
Let me tell you something.

488
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:07,179
They're the everyday common folk,
working people. Laborers.

489
00:31:07,424 --> 00:31:09,449
Construction workers, nurses.

490
00:31:09,526 --> 00:31:11,994
Play the game
when you're working for them.

491
00:31:12,062 --> 00:31:14,860
This is your campaign.
You're supposed to be in charge.

492
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,165
It's time.

493
00:31:20,103 --> 00:31:21,263
I got to go.

494
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,171
I love you, man,
and l'm with you no matter what.

495
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:32,440
-Go get them.
-I'll see you out there.

496
00:31:34,785 --> 00:31:35,979
Speak.

497
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:43,517
Chicago, please welcome
your next president.:

498
00:31:43,727 --> 00:31:46,127
Alderman Mays Gilliam.

499
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:07,941
What the hell is he doing?

500
00:32:12,155 --> 00:32:14,419
They had a speech written for me...

501
00:32:15,926 --> 00:32:17,894
about what the people need.

502
00:32:18,161 --> 00:32:20,356
But you guys are the people.

503
00:32:20,764 --> 00:32:22,095
You know what you need.

504
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:24,464
Better schools...

505
00:32:25,435 --> 00:32:26,925
better jobs...

506
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:28,928
Iess crime.

507
00:32:31,274 --> 00:32:34,004
How many of you, right now...

508
00:32:34,377 --> 00:32:39,076
work two jobs
just to have enough money to be broke?

509
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:41,216
That ain't right.

510
00:32:42,052 --> 00:32:45,351
If you work two jobs,
and at the end of the week...

511
00:32:45,522 --> 00:32:48,923
you got just enough money
to get your broke ass home...

512
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,390
Iet me hear you say, "That ain't right!"

513
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:52,858
That ain't right!

514
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:59,235
How many of you have children
that they call stupid?

515
00:32:59,736 --> 00:33:02,204
Don't be ashamed! lt ain't your fault.

516
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:05,969
I asked my niece the other day,
"What's four plus four?" She said, "44."

517
00:33:06,676 --> 00:33:09,839
But that ain't her fault!
That's the school's fault.

518
00:33:10,413 --> 00:33:14,008
If your child's school has old-ass books...

519
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:17,645
and brand-new metal detectors,
let me hear you say, "That ain't right!"

520
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:19,279
That ain't right!

521
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,650
It ain't right.

522
00:33:20,724 --> 00:33:25,491
And now we got these corporations
stealing all the money.

523
00:33:25,896 --> 00:33:28,592
They ain't stealing their money,
they stealing our money!

524
00:33:28,665 --> 00:33:29,893
The pension.

525
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,991
You work for 35 years.

526
00:33:32,169 --> 00:33:36,162
You thought you'd leave your kids
a will, now you'll leave them a won't!

527
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:39,909
You show up to get your pension,
they give you a pen!

528
00:33:40,343 --> 00:33:44,746
A damn pen! What in the hell
am l supposed to do with a pen?

529
00:33:44,915 --> 00:33:48,681
I should stab you in the neck
with this pen, Mr. Pension Taker.

530
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:50,752
Get your hand out of my pocket!

531
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:54,354
Taking everybody's pension,
and nobody going to jail.

532
00:33:54,424 --> 00:33:56,790
That's some bullshit. Ain't it?

533
00:33:56,927 --> 00:34:00,693
Meanwhile, we steal a Big Mac with cheese...

534
00:34:00,764 --> 00:34:02,857
next thing you know, we on Death Row!

535
00:34:02,933 --> 00:34:04,025
That ain't right!

536
00:34:08,271 --> 00:34:12,002
How many of you work in a city
you can't afford to live in?

537
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,302
That ain't right!

538
00:34:15,145 --> 00:34:18,945
How many of you work in a mall
you can't afford to shop in?

539
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,312
That ain't right!

540
00:34:20,483 --> 00:34:23,213
How many of you clean up a hotel...

541
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:25,880
you ain't never gonna be able to stay in?

542
00:34:26,122 --> 00:34:27,453
That ain't right!

543
00:34:31,094 --> 00:34:36,031
We got nurses that work in hospitals
they can't even afford to get sick in.

544
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:38,861
It ain't right!

545
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,033
It isn't right!

546
00:34:45,408 --> 00:34:48,377
That shit is wrong!

547
00:34:50,513 --> 00:34:51,980
It's dead wrong!

548
00:34:56,319 --> 00:34:57,479
I'm Mays Gilliam...

549
00:34:57,554 --> 00:35:01,149
and l'm running for President
of the United States of America

550
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:13,158
No questions. Sorry.

551
00:35:13,637 --> 00:35:15,127
Where's Mitch?

552
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:20,865
Go to work. Handle your business.
If you need me, call me.

553
00:35:21,611 --> 00:35:22,771
I'll call you.

554
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:27,140
Are you insane? You can't just go out
in front of 5,000 people and talk!

555
00:35:27,317 --> 00:35:30,844
And you said "shit."
Presidential candidates do not say "shit."

556
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,549
Show me a man that's never said shit,
l'll show you someone full of shit!

557
00:35:34,624 --> 00:35:35,716
Debra, hold on.

558
00:35:36,293 --> 00:35:39,160
What you just did, that was great.

559
00:35:39,329 --> 00:35:42,264
Maybe you're right.
We could tailor the speeches more to you.

560
00:35:42,332 --> 00:35:43,629
My speeches?

561
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,292
Come on, did you hear them?

562
00:35:45,368 --> 00:35:48,997
If this is gonna work, it's got to fit me.
It's got to be my campaign.

563
00:35:49,072 --> 00:35:50,505
This is not your campaign.

564
00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:53,906
You do what l tell you to,
or you'll be back in D.C. on your bicycle.

565
00:35:53,977 --> 00:35:56,172
I'm the one running for President.

566
00:35:56,246 --> 00:35:59,477
If we're gonna run this campaign,
it's got to go my way.

567
00:35:59,549 --> 00:36:01,574
We're gonna do it the way l want it done.

568
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:04,313
Hold on.
I don't know if that's such a good idea

569
00:36:04,387 --> 00:36:07,083
If you don't know, you better ask somebody.

570
00:36:21,455 --> 00:36:24,788
After a slow start, Mays Gilliam
has made some dramatic changes...

571
00:36:24,858 --> 00:36:26,655
in his presidentiaI campaign.

572
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:41,003
Hi. I'm Mays Gilliam,
candidate for President of the United States.

573
00:36:41,308 --> 00:36:43,208
This is my new headquarters.

574
00:36:43,277 --> 00:36:47,441
The individuaIs you see before you
will help me guide my campaign.

575
00:36:48,182 --> 00:36:50,343
These are my people.

576
00:36:52,987 --> 00:36:56,081
Mays Gilliam is turning the establishment
on its ear...

577
00:36:56,156 --> 00:36:58,556
with his new controversiaI campaign ads.

578
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:07,064
Ifyou love America,
vote Mays Gilliam for President.

579
00:37:07,868 --> 00:37:10,564
Paid for by Citizens for Mays Gilliam.

580
00:37:24,852 --> 00:37:27,412
The part of Mays Gilliam's
security director...

581
00:37:27,488 --> 00:37:30,389
will now be played
by Muhammad Muhammad Muhammad.

582
00:37:31,992 --> 00:37:36,224
Childcare is one of the most important
issues facing this country today.

583
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:39,331
The working mother
has to take her child to a nanny.

584
00:37:39,566 --> 00:37:42,399
The nanny has to take her child
to a babysitter.

585
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:45,233
The babysitter
has to take her child to daycare.

586
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:49,605
On the count of three, l want everybody
to take care of their own damn kids!

587
00:37:50,277 --> 00:37:53,838
Whose baby is this? lt ain't mine!

588
00:37:54,448 --> 00:37:59,044
Gay people want what every American
wants. A good house, a good job!

589
00:37:59,353 --> 00:38:02,345
I believe in gay rights
because when l see gay people...

590
00:38:02,423 --> 00:38:06,325
all l'm seeing are people,
normal people like every other American.

591
00:38:13,267 --> 00:38:17,033
Thank you for inviting me
to the Player's Ball!

592
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,535
America needs to change its ways.

593
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:26,935
I promise if l'm your President,
l will take care of everybody:

594
00:38:27,214 --> 00:38:31,617
Big business and small business,
show business and ho business.

595
00:38:44,398 --> 00:38:45,387
Hello, Debra

596
00:38:45,466 --> 00:38:46,455
Bill?

597
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:49,998
I am in Detroit at a Player's Ball
with pimps and whores.

598
00:38:50,137 --> 00:38:52,002
Excuse me, hoes!

599
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,237
I can't do this. You got to get me
out of here. I can't control him.

600
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,800
He won't listen to me!

601
00:38:57,878 --> 00:39:01,405
No, Debra
I need you out there, and this is going great.

602
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,911
This is what we wanted.

603
00:39:05,085 --> 00:39:07,246
I love this guy. "That ain't right."

604
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:09,252
He really thinks he can make a difference.

605
00:39:09,323 --> 00:39:12,451
Stop worrying. This will work out fine. Bye.

606
00:39:14,862 --> 00:39:16,193
Don't l know you?

607
00:39:16,363 --> 00:39:17,455
No!

608
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:31,576
He feels good
Things are going his way

609
00:39:32,446 --> 00:39:36,143
Hejust might be
The President someday

610
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:13,280
Mays, darling, l've been thinking.
I want a small wedding.

611
00:40:13,353 --> 00:40:15,981
I think l want 150, maybe 200 people.

612
00:40:16,156 --> 00:40:18,522
I've always said
l wanted a wedding in a church...

613
00:40:18,592 --> 00:40:21,425
but lately l've been thinking about
the Botanical Gardens.

614
00:40:21,495 --> 00:40:24,020
We could do it by the tulips.
It'll be beautiful--

615
00:40:24,164 --> 00:40:25,495
Security!

616
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:41,998
Who the hell is Mays Gilliam?

617
00:40:42,536 --> 00:40:44,128
He's running against you, sir.

618
00:40:44,305 --> 00:40:46,865
What happened to Gaines?

619
00:40:46,941 --> 00:40:48,408
He died in a plane crash.

620
00:40:49,176 --> 00:40:51,041
Get out of here! Gaines is dead?

621
00:40:51,212 --> 00:40:54,181
-Don't you remember? lt was on the news!
-Not my news.

622
00:40:55,516 --> 00:40:58,917
This fellow, Gilliam,
is an alderman from D.C.

623
00:40:59,487 --> 00:41:01,216
He took Gaines' place, sir.

624
00:41:01,288 --> 00:41:02,846
I'm running against this guy.

625
00:41:02,923 --> 00:41:03,855
Yes, sir.

626
00:41:05,025 --> 00:41:06,720
That is some bullshit.

627
00:41:07,027 --> 00:41:08,517
This is my time.

628
00:41:08,596 --> 00:41:10,928
I've been Vice President for eight years.

629
00:41:11,065 --> 00:41:14,762
I am a war hero,
and l am Sharon Stone's cousin!

630
00:41:15,302 --> 00:41:19,568
And l'll be damned if l'm going to let
my election be ruined by this asshole!

631
00:41:20,674 --> 00:41:24,337
I want this guy done. You hear me?
Finish him!

632
00:41:25,613 --> 00:41:27,911
He will be destroyed, sir, as you wish.

633
00:41:28,682 --> 00:41:32,140
This is the White House
without Mays Gilliam. Peaceful, isn't it?

634
00:41:32,286 --> 00:41:35,449
Now, this is the White House
if Gilliam is elected.

635
00:41:43,564 --> 00:41:46,032
Let's keep Mays Gilliam
out of the White House.

636
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,035
Vote Brian Lewis for President.
It's your last chance.

637
00:41:50,671 --> 00:41:52,798
How do you want to handle this?

638
00:41:53,674 --> 00:41:55,608
I don't want to go negative.

639
00:41:56,844 --> 00:41:58,277
Nobody wants to hear that.

640
00:41:58,345 --> 00:42:01,246
I want people to vote for me,
not against Lewis.

641
00:42:01,348 --> 00:42:04,579
-People don't know what they want to hear.
-We have to respond.

642
00:42:04,652 --> 00:42:08,315
We should go with something measured,
accurate. Let's call him on his record!

643
00:42:08,389 --> 00:42:11,358
You can't challenge his record
when Mays doesn't have one.

644
00:42:11,425 --> 00:42:12,790
How about a massage?

645
00:42:14,662 --> 00:42:16,061
Ladies and gentlemen...

646
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:20,123
please welcome
presidentiaI candidate Mays Gilliam.

647
00:42:31,512 --> 00:42:32,877
Thank you!

648
00:42:33,214 --> 00:42:36,513
This is Conservative Talk 520.
You're listening to Big Dave.

649
00:42:36,584 --> 00:42:40,281
Negative ads. Lewis is up, Gilliam is down.
I think it's great!

650
00:42:40,354 --> 00:42:41,343
Bottom line.:

651
00:42:41,422 --> 00:42:44,858
I don't think l want Gilliam
and his homies to be in the White House.

652
00:42:46,861 --> 00:42:50,797
People are saying these ads
are dirty politics. Give me a smaIl break!

653
00:42:50,865 --> 00:42:55,427
We're not taIking about running
a rib shack but a country!

654
00:42:55,569 --> 00:42:58,402
He's running for President
and every vote counts!

655
00:42:58,606 --> 00:43:01,404
Ladies and gentlemen, Mays Gilliam!

656
00:43:02,943 --> 00:43:06,572
And if these ads are so bad,
why hasn't Gilliam said anything?

657
00:43:07,047 --> 00:43:08,446
Howard Stern rocks!

658
00:43:08,616 --> 00:43:10,243
You're on with Big Dave.

659
00:43:10,317 --> 00:43:14,014
The reason Gilliam hasn't responded
is because he has too much integrity.

660
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:26,925
We just got endorsements
from Raekwon the Chef...

661
00:43:27,134 --> 00:43:28,863
and Ghostface Killah.

662
00:43:29,303 --> 00:43:31,237
-Is this good?
-It's great.

663
00:43:33,207 --> 00:43:35,266
Where are we on this running mate thing?

664
00:43:35,643 --> 00:43:38,635
I've been making calls.
Nobody wants to run with you.

665
00:43:38,846 --> 00:43:40,245
Who did you call?

666
00:43:40,848 --> 00:43:42,372
Everybody.

667
00:43:42,783 --> 00:43:44,444
Did you call Hammer?

668
00:43:45,286 --> 00:43:47,777
No, l did not call Hammer.

669
00:43:49,456 --> 00:43:51,424
Then you didn't call everybody.

670
00:43:51,792 --> 00:43:53,987
Mr. Gilliam, can l have your autograph?

671
00:43:54,061 --> 00:43:55,358
I'll be right back.

672
00:43:58,098 --> 00:44:00,259
-Should we call Hammer?
-No.

673
00:44:01,969 --> 00:44:03,561
Say cheese!

674
00:44:03,804 --> 00:44:07,900
Mays Gilliam did not attend
this year's annuaI raIly against cancer.

675
00:44:09,076 --> 00:44:12,239
Is Mays Gilliam for cancer
or against cancer?

676
00:44:13,147 --> 00:44:15,877
Mays Gilliam, he's for cancer.

677
00:44:16,417 --> 00:44:20,251
Vote Brian Lewis for President.
It's your last chance.

678
00:44:22,089 --> 00:44:23,784
Cancer lover!

679
00:44:25,145 --> 00:44:28,046
No, he does not get away with this crap!

680
00:44:28,114 --> 00:44:30,639
This is what we'll do.
You ever watch Bugs Bunny?

681
00:44:30,717 --> 00:44:35,552
Bugs would always shoot Elmer Fudd
in the face and drop an anvil on his head.

682
00:44:35,722 --> 00:44:39,055
But what made Elmer really mad
is when Bugs Bunny kissed him.

683
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:40,922
We got to kiss this bitch.

684
00:44:41,294 --> 00:44:43,762
-How do you propose we do that?
-Watch this.

685
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:48,162
I'm a Klansman. I hate niggers, Jews,
and fags, but l love Brian Lewis.

686
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,703
Yo, what's up? l'm Osama Bin Laden.

687
00:44:51,938 --> 00:44:54,668
I hate America, but l love Brian Lewis.

688
00:44:54,941 --> 00:44:57,034
Paid for by Osama Bin Laden.

689
00:44:57,744 --> 00:44:59,974
Sharon Stone is a defector.

690
00:45:00,046 --> 00:45:03,504
That's what Lewis campaign insiders
are saying about the Hollywood star...

691
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:08,282
and cousin of Vice President Lewis,
after Stone's endorsement of Mays Gilliam.

692
00:45:08,354 --> 00:45:09,616
I don't believe it!

693
00:45:11,491 --> 00:45:12,480
Yeah!

694
00:45:14,327 --> 00:45:15,726
I know!

695
00:45:16,396 --> 00:45:18,057
Did you hear....

696
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,296
What are you doing here?

697
00:45:21,367 --> 00:45:24,131
Gilliam is over 30 points.

698
00:45:25,238 --> 00:45:28,674
That means even if he loses
he's the frontrunner in 2008.

699
00:45:28,742 --> 00:45:31,802
In case you've forgotten,
l intend to run for President in 2008...

700
00:45:31,878 --> 00:45:33,709
and l am not running against him.

701
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,140
So this is over.
Either you put a stop to it or l will.

702
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:40,947
I came on board to run a campaign
for a man we didn't expect to win...

703
00:45:41,087 --> 00:45:43,146
not to sabotage him so he'd lose.

704
00:45:43,223 --> 00:45:46,750
You're in this as thick as l am.
Of course he's supposed to lose!

705
00:45:46,826 --> 00:45:48,259
That's why we picked him.

706
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:50,762
Are you with me or are you with him?

707
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:52,991
I thought you wanted
what was best for the party.

708
00:45:53,066 --> 00:45:54,693
I'm what's best for the party!

709
00:45:55,702 --> 00:45:57,067
What's the matter?

710
00:45:57,137 --> 00:46:00,368
Democracy doesn't work for you
when you're not winning?

711
00:46:02,008 --> 00:46:03,407
I'm with him.

712
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:12,181
I'm with him?

713
00:46:21,294 --> 00:46:24,161
-Who are these people again?
-The Urban Business Board.

714
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:27,290
-What are your plans for Social Security?
-Give it to old people.

715
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,801
-Your plans on global warming?
-Global ice tea

716
00:46:29,869 --> 00:46:31,530
-You the man!
-You the woman!

717
00:46:34,107 --> 00:46:36,974
I want to introduce you
to Chester Norris Allen.

718
00:46:37,277 --> 00:46:41,509
He owns a bottling plant in D.C.
and l spoke to him about our problem.

719
00:46:41,581 --> 00:46:43,071
We've got a nice check for you.

720
00:46:43,149 --> 00:46:45,845
We can't take it. You sell malt liquor to kids.

721
00:46:45,919 --> 00:46:47,216
I do no such thing.

722
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:51,518
Come on, man. It's orange beer
with a nipple top. Now, who's that for?

723
00:46:51,758 --> 00:46:53,419
It's Crib Malt Liquor, man!

724
00:46:53,593 --> 00:46:55,060
He's unbelievable!

725
00:46:55,728 --> 00:46:59,129
Damn it, we need that money!
Why do you make everything so difficult?

726
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:01,190
It's Crib Malt Liquor!

727
00:47:01,701 --> 00:47:04,636
"Crib Malt Liquor,
just like Mama used to make"?

728
00:47:04,704 --> 00:47:06,262
Whose mama? Not my mama!

729
00:47:07,106 --> 00:47:10,974
The situation is getting tense with the threat
of the bus line being shut down.

730
00:47:11,044 --> 00:47:13,979
Protestors took their concerns
to transit officiaIs...

731
00:47:14,047 --> 00:47:18,040
but taIks broke down when the newly
appointed aIderman, ReginaId Shannon...

732
00:47:18,117 --> 00:47:20,847
was punched in the face
by an angry protestor.

733
00:47:23,456 --> 00:47:25,788
-Good evening, sir.
-What's up, Nikki?

734
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:29,625
I noticed you weren't at the party,
so l thought...

735
00:47:30,263 --> 00:47:34,700
if there is anything you would like
for me to do, l would be happy to.

736
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,425
Could l ask you something?

737
00:47:38,805 --> 00:47:39,999
Yes.

738
00:47:41,307 --> 00:47:43,673
You seem like a nice girl.

739
00:47:45,345 --> 00:47:47,506
How did you get into this line of work?

740
00:47:53,353 --> 00:47:55,878
I went to the University of Nebraska..

741
00:47:56,055 --> 00:47:59,024
where l majored
in Theater and Communications.

742
00:47:59,225 --> 00:48:02,626
I did some extra work,
and a few things that went straight to video.

743
00:48:06,933 --> 00:48:07,922
Okay.

744
00:48:08,434 --> 00:48:10,095
Can l ask you a question?

745
00:48:10,169 --> 00:48:11,397
Yeah, sure.

746
00:48:11,571 --> 00:48:15,974
Since l've been here, you haven't really
given me any assignments.

747
00:48:17,043 --> 00:48:19,477
I was wondering if you find me attractive.

748
00:48:23,683 --> 00:48:25,480
I think you're....

749
00:48:25,585 --> 00:48:28,452
I think you're very attractive. It's just that...

750
00:48:29,522 --> 00:48:34,152
I like to get to know people
before l get involved.

751
00:48:35,862 --> 00:48:38,524
I don't mean to be out of line, sir...

752
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:41,289
but are you?

753
00:48:44,637 --> 00:48:46,002
Am l what?

754
00:48:46,072 --> 00:48:48,233
Trying to get to know somebody.

755
00:48:53,611 --> 00:48:57,012
-It is late, l'm out of here.
-You need to take a cab.

756
00:48:57,615 --> 00:48:59,674
I'll be fine. I'm just gonna walk.

757
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:07,751
Take a cab!

758
00:49:08,726 --> 00:49:10,921
I'll be fine. I'll walk.

759
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:19,996
Need a ride?

760
00:49:26,444 --> 00:49:27,968
Where are we going?

761
00:49:28,112 --> 00:49:30,444
I just thought l'd give you a little tour.

762
00:49:42,994 --> 00:49:46,430
If you look over there,
it's the Lincoln Memorial.

763
00:49:47,732 --> 00:49:49,359
Lincoln freed the slaves...

764
00:49:49,434 --> 00:49:53,268
but before he did it, he said,
"First you niggers got to build me a statue."

765
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:57,774
Right there is the Jefferson Memorial.

766
00:49:57,842 --> 00:49:59,810
Jefferson had a black mistress.

767
00:49:59,877 --> 00:50:04,075
He said, "All men are created equal,
but black women got the nicest ass!"

768
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:08,146
That's the Treasury.

769
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:12,050
If you look real hard in the window,
you can see Oprah counting her money.

770
00:50:14,025 --> 00:50:17,119
$20 trillion one, $20 trillion two....

771
00:50:17,261 --> 00:50:18,319
Hi, Oprah!

772
00:50:24,535 --> 00:50:25,832
What's it like...

773
00:50:25,903 --> 00:50:29,964
traveling all over the country
and meeting all those people?

774
00:50:31,042 --> 00:50:34,273
I like it. I like traveling,
l like meeting the people.

775
00:50:34,345 --> 00:50:38,714
But sometimes, you don't know
if people like you for you.

776
00:50:38,816 --> 00:50:41,307
-Know what l mean?
-I like you for you.

777
00:50:43,454 --> 00:50:45,354
And l think you're okay.

778
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:47,624
-Just okay?
-I'm just playing.

779
00:50:50,695 --> 00:50:52,754
I forgot how nice D.C. was.

780
00:50:54,265 --> 00:50:57,132
I'm always working.
I never get a chance to check it out.

781
00:50:57,201 --> 00:51:00,466
Maybe you need to take advantage
of what's in front of you.

782
00:51:00,538 --> 00:51:04,838
You never know, you may look up someday,
and it might not be there.

783
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:10,672
Freeze!

784
00:51:11,015 --> 00:51:14,610
Put your hands up in the air
and step away from Mr. Gilliam!

785
00:51:14,685 --> 00:51:15,879
It's okay!

786
00:51:16,087 --> 00:51:18,851
-What the hell are you doing?
-What the hell are you doing?

787
00:51:18,923 --> 00:51:22,882
You can't go dashing off
in the middle of the night with some girl.

788
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,622
Something's happened.
We got to pack and get out of here!

789
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:28,221
Somebody make sure she gets home safely.

790
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:30,759
We have a plane waiting for us.

791
00:51:36,707 --> 00:51:40,734
In Florida today, guns and explosives
were found at ajunior high school.

792
00:51:40,811 --> 00:51:44,747
No one was injured in the incident,
but with just six weeks till Election Day...

793
00:51:44,982 --> 00:51:47,473
this could be a hot-button issue
for both parties.

794
00:51:47,551 --> 00:51:50,645
Now, back to the Jay-Z song
aIready in progress.

795
00:51:52,189 --> 00:51:55,488
Muhammad, get me a gun
in case another kid tries to get crazy.

796
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:59,222
This could work in our favor.
Florida is a big Second Amendment state.

797
00:51:59,296 --> 00:52:02,060
This is serious. This is not the Player's Ball.

798
00:52:02,132 --> 00:52:05,966
You can cut into Lewis' numbers.
Talk about the kids, not about the guns.

799
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:08,500
If l get shot, everybody is fired.

800
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:10,233
One question here.

801
00:52:10,307 --> 00:52:14,038
There's been an outcry that something
needs to be done about school violence.

802
00:52:14,111 --> 00:52:16,011
What do you plan to do about this?

803
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,172
I feel we need to talk to our kids....

804
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,349
Excuse me.

805
00:52:34,364 --> 00:52:35,729
Hello, children.

806
00:52:36,266 --> 00:52:37,528
Good morning.

807
00:52:39,403 --> 00:52:43,032
Pay attention.
This is going to be a class: Bullshit 101 .

808
00:52:43,106 --> 00:52:47,042
Ladies and gentlemen,
our American children are hurting today...

809
00:52:47,444 --> 00:52:49,742
and we need to reach out to them...

810
00:52:49,813 --> 00:52:52,577
and give them all
a good old-fashioned American hug.

811
00:52:54,651 --> 00:52:58,178
America is the greatest country
on the face of the earth...

812
00:52:58,722 --> 00:53:00,155
and l want to say:

813
00:53:00,657 --> 00:53:02,147
God bless America!

814
00:53:02,826 --> 00:53:04,384
And no place else.

815
00:53:04,561 --> 00:53:06,688
Thank you. Thank you, children.

816
00:53:06,763 --> 00:53:09,493
No more bombs now. And don't use guns.

817
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,325
-That went well.
-Very touching.

818
00:53:12,402 --> 00:53:14,267
-The kids liked me.
-You were very genuine.

819
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:15,930
They responded.

820
00:53:16,006 --> 00:53:19,169
I tried to hug a girl and a boy
so l wouldn't seem sexist.

821
00:53:19,943 --> 00:53:21,638
Mr. Vice President!

822
00:53:22,279 --> 00:53:24,213
Welcome to the show, Alderman Gilliam.

823
00:53:24,281 --> 00:53:26,613
Surprised you're not somewhere
with your girlfriend.

824
00:53:26,683 --> 00:53:27,843
How do you know about her?

825
00:53:27,918 --> 00:53:30,478
I'm the government. I know everything.

826
00:53:30,621 --> 00:53:32,088
We really should debate.

827
00:53:33,957 --> 00:53:35,857
Let's get something straight.

828
00:53:35,959 --> 00:53:38,689
I don't know you, and l don't like you.

829
00:53:39,563 --> 00:53:42,896
Party's over. I'm fixing to whip your ass.

830
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:45,066
You got it?

831
00:53:49,273 --> 00:53:50,900
Sir, we really should debate.

832
00:53:52,576 --> 00:53:56,034
God bless America, and no place else.

833
00:54:00,493 --> 00:54:03,155
Sir, we just got this off the uplink.

834
00:54:03,396 --> 00:54:04,328
What is it?

835
00:54:04,397 --> 00:54:07,230
An off-the-record comment by Mays Gilliam.

836
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,129
-Bad?
-Yes, sir.

837
00:54:09,736 --> 00:54:10,794
Good work.

838
00:54:17,443 --> 00:54:19,570
It's on! Guys, come here!

839
00:54:19,646 --> 00:54:23,013
...Lewis was on the scene
comforting parents and students.

840
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:26,284
The press is in Lewis' back pocket.

841
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:30,786
In this CNB News exclusive,
our cameras caught Gilliam...

842
00:54:31,024 --> 00:54:35,051
making what was arguably
the most controversiaI statement of the day.

843
00:54:35,295 --> 00:54:38,321
They act like us.
We're bombing countries aIl the time.

844
00:54:38,398 --> 00:54:40,525
If l was 12, l'd have a gun, too.

845
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,828
Tell me you didn't say that.

846
00:54:41,935 --> 00:54:45,769
I didn't know the camera was on me.
I was playing around with some sound guy.

847
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:48,170
You didn't know the camera was on you?

848
00:54:49,475 --> 00:54:53,571
Of course it's on you. It's always on you!
You're running for President!

849
00:54:53,646 --> 00:54:54,806
I told you....

850
00:54:54,881 --> 00:54:57,111
This is all your fault!

851
00:54:58,718 --> 00:55:01,949
Gilliam is under investigation by the FBl...

852
00:55:02,021 --> 00:55:03,921
for his involvement with this man...

853
00:55:04,123 --> 00:55:07,718
friend and associate
and accused drug lord, Warren Pryor.

854
00:55:07,794 --> 00:55:10,490
-Lord, we're going to jail.
-We're not going to jail.

855
00:55:10,596 --> 00:55:11,654
Is it true?

856
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:14,359
What's up, Warren?

857
00:55:14,434 --> 00:55:17,528
I know him, but l don't drug-lord know him.

858
00:55:17,603 --> 00:55:21,699
It's just a guy l say "What's up?" to.
But l don't know him know him.

859
00:55:21,841 --> 00:55:25,106
Do you have drugs on you?
Get them off, l'm not going to jail for you.

860
00:55:25,178 --> 00:55:26,475
Are you on the pipe?

861
00:55:27,046 --> 00:55:29,105
This is messed up
This reaIly sucks

862
00:55:29,182 --> 00:55:31,548
Every time you're doing good
troublejust pops up

863
00:55:31,617 --> 00:55:33,881
He doesn't know what he's gonna do

864
00:55:36,489 --> 00:55:38,923
This is messed up
This reaIly sucks

865
00:55:38,992 --> 00:55:41,017
Keep your head up, it's your best bet

866
00:55:41,094 --> 00:55:43,221
Let's hope the election's not through

867
00:55:43,296 --> 00:55:47,596
If you see Mays Gilliam,
please do not call the authorities.

868
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,631
Just do whatever you can
to make his life a living hell.

869
00:55:52,372 --> 00:55:53,464
No more questions!

870
00:55:53,539 --> 00:55:56,975
If l see Mays Gilliam,
l'll bust a cap in his ass.

871
00:55:57,043 --> 00:56:01,639
Gilliam is done
and Big Dave says, "Waa-waa!"

872
00:56:02,515 --> 00:56:03,709
Oh, God.

873
00:56:04,617 --> 00:56:06,278
What am l going to do?

874
00:56:07,186 --> 00:56:10,781
What are you worried about?
Your face isn't on the side of a bus.

875
00:56:10,857 --> 00:56:13,052
I'll be the one taking a hit for this.

876
00:56:13,126 --> 00:56:17,688
Get me on the news so l can apologize.
That's what the people want to hear.

877
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:19,261
You're probably right.

878
00:56:19,332 --> 00:56:21,926
Make a statement of some kind,
try and sound sincere--

879
00:56:22,001 --> 00:56:23,696
Just give me a break!

880
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:27,801
You think you can say you're sorry
and all of this will go away?

881
00:56:28,875 --> 00:56:33,141
Mays, you're running for President
of the United States of America

882
00:56:34,881 --> 00:56:38,476
Do you have any idea why they chose you?

883
00:56:41,888 --> 00:56:44,254
-We picked you because--
-Shut up!

884
00:56:49,162 --> 00:56:51,528
You're here to lose.

885
00:56:52,965 --> 00:56:55,490
Arnot picked you so you could lose.

886
00:56:56,269 --> 00:56:58,169
Think about it.

887
00:56:58,404 --> 00:57:01,601
If they had any idea
they could win this thing...

888
00:57:01,674 --> 00:57:05,405
do you think they would have chosen
an ignorant-ass nigger like you?

889
00:57:10,616 --> 00:57:11,913
Wait up.

890
00:57:12,351 --> 00:57:15,411
You're not calling me an ignorant nigger...

891
00:57:15,521 --> 00:57:18,081
and thinking you're staying on my bus.

892
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:22,691
I am not getting off this bus.
We're in the middle of nowhere--

893
00:57:22,762 --> 00:57:25,390
Now you need a ride
from an ignorant nigger.

894
00:57:25,465 --> 00:57:27,296
I am not getting off this bus!

895
00:57:27,633 --> 00:57:28,657
Apologize.

896
00:57:29,202 --> 00:57:30,601
Security!

897
00:57:31,971 --> 00:57:33,529
Damn you, Mays Gilliam!

898
00:57:35,341 --> 00:57:37,502
You knew about this all along?

899
00:58:00,766 --> 00:58:03,394
Is there trouble
inside the Gilliam campaign?

900
00:58:03,469 --> 00:58:07,166
That's what Washington insiders
want to know after Gilliam's chief advisor...

901
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:10,107
Debra Lassiter, left the campaign trail.

902
00:58:10,209 --> 00:58:12,643
Down in the polls,
Gilliam still has no running mate.

903
00:58:12,712 --> 00:58:15,306
Sources say
the Teamsters may endorse Lewis.

904
00:58:15,381 --> 00:58:18,009
Did Gilliam kill JonBenet Ramsay?
Police want to know.

905
00:58:18,084 --> 00:58:20,917
The big question.: Where is Mays Gilliam?

906
00:58:22,088 --> 00:58:25,080
I'll tell you where he's at.
He's with his peeps!

907
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:32,293
-Hello?
-You up?

908
00:58:32,765 --> 00:58:35,598
I was hoping you'd call. Are you okay?

909
00:58:35,701 --> 00:58:38,226
I don't know. I guess l'm all right.

910
00:58:38,838 --> 00:58:41,033
Come on, talk to Mama

911
00:58:41,474 --> 00:58:44,102
I don't know.
It seems like they're trying to get me.

912
00:58:44,177 --> 00:58:47,169
Everywhere l turn,
they're trying to put a foot in my ass.

913
00:58:47,246 --> 00:58:50,613
After what you said,
you need a foot put up in your ass.

914
00:58:50,716 --> 00:58:53,879
What did you expect?
They would just make you President?

915
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,852
They take a poll for everything l do.

916
00:58:57,390 --> 00:59:02,123
You ever been to a horserace?
My dad used to take me when l was little.

917
00:59:02,962 --> 00:59:05,362
The horses wear blinders.

918
00:59:06,065 --> 00:59:09,660
They don't even see each other.
They just run their race.

919
00:59:10,203 --> 00:59:13,604
So don't worry about Lewis,
don't worry about the press...

920
00:59:13,706 --> 00:59:15,731
just run your race.

921
00:59:15,975 --> 00:59:17,567
Let me ask you something.

922
00:59:17,677 --> 00:59:18,701
Okay.

923
00:59:19,312 --> 00:59:20,802
What are you wearing?

924
00:59:21,247 --> 00:59:23,215
Now, you know you need to stop.

925
00:59:31,011 --> 00:59:33,275
Man, news travels fast.

926
00:59:33,647 --> 00:59:37,549
Not 10 minutes after you fired me,
l had two offers for jobs.

927
00:59:37,618 --> 00:59:38,710
Good offers.

928
00:59:38,786 --> 00:59:40,185
What are you doing here?

929
00:59:40,487 --> 00:59:43,945
I know you got no reason to trust me,
but l'm asking you to.

930
00:59:44,291 --> 00:59:46,350
You've got five weeks left.

931
00:59:46,427 --> 00:59:49,396
I know Lassiter is out, but l think...

932
00:59:50,197 --> 00:59:52,665
I can help you do this.

933
00:59:52,733 --> 00:59:54,394
I want to help you.

934
00:59:56,603 --> 00:59:58,594
And l'm sorry, Mays.

935
00:59:59,173 --> 01:00:01,232
I don't know what else to say...

936
01:00:01,475 --> 01:00:04,672
but as bad as things look,
l don't think you should quit.

937
01:00:05,612 --> 01:00:07,409
Who said l was quitting?

938
01:00:07,881 --> 01:00:09,473
I wish l could quit.

939
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:11,311
I wish it was that easy.

940
01:00:12,486 --> 01:00:14,010
You're lucky.

941
01:00:14,521 --> 01:00:17,684
You are so lucky.
You don't know how good you got it.

942
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:19,858
You just represent yourself.

943
01:00:19,927 --> 01:00:21,053
Me?

944
01:00:22,029 --> 01:00:24,088
I represent my whole race.

945
01:00:24,832 --> 01:00:26,265
If l quit...

946
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:29,564
there won't be another black candidate
for 50 years.

947
01:00:31,672 --> 01:00:32,798
All right.

948
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:38,375
We can get rid of the school thing
with a statement that will blow things over.

949
01:00:38,545 --> 01:00:39,944
But we need a running mate.

950
01:00:40,013 --> 01:00:42,743
Who am l supposed to pick?
Nobody wants to run with me.

951
01:00:42,816 --> 01:00:44,875
We need somebody we can trust.

952
01:00:47,421 --> 01:00:48,820
Who do you trust?

953
01:00:50,891 --> 01:00:52,984
In the midst of his own Cinderella story...

954
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:55,995
presidentiaI candidate
Gilliam is shaking it up.

955
01:00:56,063 --> 01:00:58,759
He's chosen his brother, Mitch Gilliam...

956
01:00:58,832 --> 01:01:01,960
a bail bondsman from Chicago,
as his running mate.

957
01:01:02,402 --> 01:01:05,667
PoliticaI anaIysts say this may be
too little, too late.

958
01:01:05,739 --> 01:01:07,866
Hi, l'm with the Pork Commission--

959
01:01:08,041 --> 01:01:10,566
I'm from the Athlete's Foot--

960
01:01:11,845 --> 01:01:12,971
Brother!

961
01:01:13,147 --> 01:01:15,707
Can you get my demo tape to somebody--

962
01:01:25,159 --> 01:01:26,387
Are these your bags?

963
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:29,088
Look at my shoes and at the bags.
Shut up and follow me.

964
01:01:31,098 --> 01:01:32,565
Back up.

965
01:01:39,406 --> 01:01:42,773
What do you have to say about
your brother's controversial comments?

966
01:01:42,943 --> 01:01:46,606
My gosh, lady,
my brother said he was sorry. Let it go.

967
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:48,941
See, that's why nobody like your ass.

968
01:01:50,951 --> 01:01:53,749
We got work to do.
We way behind in the polls.

969
01:01:53,821 --> 01:01:55,755
-Am l getting paid for this?
-Yeah.

970
01:01:56,924 --> 01:02:00,382
You're running for the vice presidency.
You're a bail bondsman.

971
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:04,726
You have no Washington experience,
no political experience or connections.

972
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:08,734
How does being a bail bondsman
qualify you to be Vice President?

973
01:02:09,503 --> 01:02:11,027
I am a bail bondsman.

974
01:02:11,171 --> 01:02:13,867
People come to me when they in trouble,
like the USa

975
01:02:13,941 --> 01:02:16,535
We bail people out. We bail out Mexico...

976
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:19,477
the savings and loan, the airline industry.

977
01:02:19,646 --> 01:02:22,979
Now you ask me, sir,
what qualify me to run for Vice President.

978
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:25,541
When the country is in trouble,
l'll bail them out.

979
01:02:25,619 --> 01:02:28,213
Hold that thought.
We have a caller from Detroit.

980
01:02:28,288 --> 01:02:32,691
Mitch! Why you looking around?
lt's Reggie.... Where my money at?

981
01:02:32,759 --> 01:02:35,557
Don't call me with that bullshit!
You see l'm on TV.

982
01:02:35,629 --> 01:02:37,221
What about NATO?

983
01:02:37,297 --> 01:02:40,858
I never met Nato.
I don't talk about people behind their back.

984
01:02:40,934 --> 01:02:43,459
NATO is the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.

985
01:02:43,904 --> 01:02:46,873
I thought you were talking about
this guy named Nato.

986
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:48,931
But you have to know these things.

987
01:02:49,042 --> 01:02:51,135
Do you know Nato Jacobs?

988
01:02:51,311 --> 01:02:54,371
Do you know Nato Jacobs?

989
01:02:54,581 --> 01:02:56,310
I'm sorry, l haven't met the gentleman.

990
01:02:56,383 --> 01:02:57,850
That's what l said.

991
01:02:57,918 --> 01:03:01,115
You know nothing about Nato?
l know nothing about NATO.

992
01:03:01,355 --> 01:03:04,722
Why are you out here
since inmates don't have the right to vote?

993
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:07,658
It's not about the vote.
We're looking out for the convicts.

994
01:03:07,728 --> 01:03:10,754
We want to make sure
when they get out that they stay out.

995
01:03:10,831 --> 01:03:14,528
The better the education,
they become more productive citizens.

996
01:03:14,701 --> 01:03:16,225
Mitch! What's up?

997
01:03:16,303 --> 01:03:17,429
Shorty G!

998
01:03:17,504 --> 01:03:19,233
It's good to see you, boy!

999
01:03:19,306 --> 01:03:23,140
This is Shorty G. I arrested his ass.
I thought you got the chair, boy.

1000
01:03:23,243 --> 01:03:26,644
Mr. Gilliam, how would you deaI
with white-collar crime?

1001
01:03:26,947 --> 01:03:29,472
There's no such thing as white-collar crime.

1002
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:31,880
And there's no such thing
as black-on-black crime.

1003
01:03:31,985 --> 01:03:33,179
Crime is crime.

1004
01:03:33,253 --> 01:03:36,882
I don't care if you have a white collar
or a tank top.

1005
01:03:37,124 --> 01:03:39,786
If you rob me, l'll whup your ass.

1006
01:03:41,379 --> 01:03:45,509
I'm Janet Silvers reporting live in D.C.,
where transit operators....

1007
01:03:45,583 --> 01:03:48,575
-I wish we'd get into the White House.
-To have a cookout?

1008
01:03:48,653 --> 01:03:50,780
They were just talking about your ward.

1009
01:03:50,855 --> 01:03:52,152
What's going on down there?

1010
01:03:52,223 --> 01:03:56,125
They want to cut bus service
until they finish construction. I should go.

1011
01:03:56,194 --> 01:03:59,163
-So you can blow up the bus line?
-One thing at a time.

1012
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:03,064
The Teamsters haven't endorsed Lewis yet.
Our numbers are going up.

1013
01:04:03,134 --> 01:04:06,467
If we want a real shot at this thing,
we got to get Lewis to debate.

1014
01:04:06,537 --> 01:04:08,437
He knows that. That's why he won't.

1015
01:04:08,506 --> 01:04:10,633
He's avoiding me
like he owes me child support.

1016
01:04:10,708 --> 01:04:13,836
He is scared. He's holding the ball,
hoping the clock will run out.

1017
01:04:13,911 --> 01:04:16,846
That's a punk move.
Ducking and hiding like a little bitch!

1018
01:04:16,948 --> 01:04:20,440
That may be, but he won't debate you
because you call him a little bitch.

1019
01:04:23,254 --> 01:04:25,586
What this community needs--

1020
01:04:25,656 --> 01:04:28,625
Is for you to debate me right now!

1021
01:04:28,693 --> 01:04:30,126
Tell the people that!

1022
01:04:30,194 --> 01:04:32,628
I thought l told you that we won't stop.

1023
01:04:32,797 --> 01:04:34,196
Now, my agenda--

1024
01:04:34,265 --> 01:04:35,789
I'll tell you about our agenda

1025
01:04:35,867 --> 01:04:37,562
It's to have a debate right now!

1026
01:04:37,635 --> 01:04:40,297
Get rid of this zero and talk to the hero.

1027
01:04:42,573 --> 01:04:44,803
You got time to jog, but not to debate?

1028
01:04:44,876 --> 01:04:46,366
You can run, but you can't hide.

1029
01:04:46,444 --> 01:04:48,105
I thought l told you we won't stop.

1030
01:04:48,813 --> 01:04:51,748
What you looking for, the news?
The news is we want to debate!

1031
01:04:52,216 --> 01:04:54,776
-Why did you change the channel?
-He's scared!

1032
01:04:55,787 --> 01:04:58,051
-A word from our sponsor.
-We want to debate!

1033
01:04:58,122 --> 01:05:01,285
I thought l told you that we won't stop.

1034
01:05:04,328 --> 01:05:05,454
Yo, Lewis!

1035
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:09,396
Your mother's ass is so big,
when she sits down she's three feet taIler.

1036
01:05:09,934 --> 01:05:13,062
Yo, Lewis!
Your mother's got a reaIly big ass!

1037
01:05:13,137 --> 01:05:15,731
Sir, it's time we prepare for a debate.

1038
01:05:15,807 --> 01:05:18,605
Give me one good reason
l should debate that jerk.

1039
01:05:18,676 --> 01:05:21,304
-He talked about your mother!
-So what?

1040
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:25,981
Are you going to just let him
talk about me like that?

1041
01:05:30,955 --> 01:05:34,891
After some inventive chiding
on the part of Alderman Mays Gilliam...

1042
01:05:34,959 --> 01:05:38,656
Vice President Lewis
has finally agreed to one debate...

1043
01:05:38,996 --> 01:05:41,328
the night before the election.

1044
01:05:42,733 --> 01:05:45,293
So, baby brother, this is it. You ready?

1045
01:05:46,304 --> 01:05:47,862
All right, l guess.

1046
01:05:47,939 --> 01:05:50,737
You guess? You don't know?
You either ready or you ain't.

1047
01:05:51,542 --> 01:05:54,033
What's your problem? l'm ready, okay?

1048
01:05:54,345 --> 01:05:58,406
No, you ain't. Look at you.
If you call this ready, this won't get it.

1049
01:05:58,483 --> 01:06:01,316
Dress for the job you want,
not for the job you got.

1050
01:06:01,385 --> 01:06:03,114
You ain't talking about my clothes.

1051
01:06:03,187 --> 01:06:05,246
Come on now. This ain't about me.

1052
01:06:05,389 --> 01:06:09,155
If l got a good idea, it shouldn't matter
what the hell l'm wearing!

1053
01:06:09,994 --> 01:06:11,825
You know you messed up, man.

1054
01:06:12,563 --> 01:06:14,190
I'm telling you right now.

1055
01:06:14,465 --> 01:06:16,456
You know, this ain't about me!

1056
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:21,463
Lewis ain't no punk. He ain't no joke.

1057
01:06:21,639 --> 01:06:24,437
That man has been Vice President
for eight years.

1058
01:06:24,842 --> 01:06:27,333
He's a war hero.
He's Sharon Stone's cousin.

1059
01:06:27,411 --> 01:06:28,878
You better come correct.

1060
01:06:30,081 --> 01:06:32,379
Yeah? Well, l got us this far!

1061
01:06:33,918 --> 01:06:36,045
This is as far as you're going to get!

1062
01:06:36,554 --> 01:06:39,045
-It's like that?
-That's the way it is.

1063
01:06:39,157 --> 01:06:41,421
Geller and them up there
pumping your head up.

1064
01:06:41,492 --> 01:06:43,653
But Lewis will smack it back down!

1065
01:07:03,948 --> 01:07:05,415
Oh, my God.

1066
01:07:05,917 --> 01:07:07,612
Little brother, you all right?

1067
01:07:11,556 --> 01:07:13,251
That's what your ass get.

1068
01:07:13,324 --> 01:07:16,225
You need anything?
Because it look like you need some help.

1069
01:07:16,294 --> 01:07:18,592
You gonna get yours! l'll tell Ma!

1070
01:07:18,663 --> 01:07:19,925
You better not tell!

1071
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:27,137
Hello?

1072
01:07:29,006 --> 01:07:33,773
Don't intrude in my life anymore. I don't
want to have anything to do with you...

1073
01:07:33,844 --> 01:07:35,471
not after the way you treated me.

1074
01:07:35,546 --> 01:07:38,947
I'm sorry l threw you off the bus.
It was wrong.

1075
01:07:39,016 --> 01:07:41,348
I couldn't take what you were saying.

1076
01:07:41,419 --> 01:07:42,716
What do you want?

1077
01:07:43,521 --> 01:07:44,818
I want to win.

1078
01:07:52,729 --> 01:07:56,722
Welcome to New York City
for the 2004 Presidential Debates.

1079
01:07:57,434 --> 01:07:58,492
Where is he?

1080
01:07:58,568 --> 01:08:00,729
He was right behind me.
Should l look for him?

1081
01:08:00,804 --> 01:08:03,204
-They're getting nervous.
-We've got to do something.

1082
01:08:03,273 --> 01:08:04,934
-I can do something.
-No!

1083
01:08:05,475 --> 01:08:09,775
Ladies and gentlemen,
Vice President Brian Lewis.

1084
01:08:21,158 --> 01:08:23,319
Wait. Here they come.

1085
01:08:25,729 --> 01:08:26,889
Sweet.

1086
01:08:27,898 --> 01:08:29,422
Hello, Martin.

1087
01:08:29,666 --> 01:08:32,260
Sorry l'm late. I had to change.

1088
01:08:32,335 --> 01:08:35,429
-Mr. Earl, nice to see you.
-Nice to see you too, sir.

1089
01:08:35,539 --> 01:08:36,801
Let's move.

1090
01:08:38,875 --> 01:08:42,538
There are 250 million people out there
deciding who to vote for.

1091
01:08:42,612 --> 01:08:45,706
They all know Lewis
didn't want to debate you. Show them why.

1092
01:08:45,782 --> 01:08:48,683
-Stay focused.
-Take your time.

1093
01:08:48,785 --> 01:08:51,720
If he get out of pocket,
put your foot in his ass.

1094
01:08:51,888 --> 01:08:53,651
By the way, nice suit.

1095
01:08:55,258 --> 01:08:57,419
-"Fuh-buh"?
-Fubu.

1096
01:08:57,494 --> 01:08:59,121
Even l knew that.

1097
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:04,532
Ladies and gentlemen,
Alderman Mays Gilliam.

1098
01:09:17,147 --> 01:09:19,445
Yo, when's Martin coming on, man?

1099
01:09:22,052 --> 01:09:24,145
My momma told me to whup your ass.

1100
01:09:29,392 --> 01:09:34,091
The first question is directed
by coin flip to the Vice President.

1101
01:09:34,698 --> 01:09:36,461
Vice President Lewis...

1102
01:09:36,566 --> 01:09:39,262
what steps should be taken
to limit our youth's access...

1103
01:09:39,336 --> 01:09:41,065
to violent materials?

1104
01:09:41,137 --> 01:09:44,368
Our American children's futures
are at stake here.

1105
01:09:45,008 --> 01:09:49,172
We need to study this issue,
and appropriate legislation...

1106
01:09:49,246 --> 01:09:52,443
that will return us to an America
we can be proud of.

1107
01:09:53,283 --> 01:09:55,911
God bless America, and no place else.

1108
01:10:00,857 --> 01:10:04,054
Alderman Gilliam, same question, please.

1109
01:10:04,127 --> 01:10:06,925
How do we limit violent material? Turn it off.

1110
01:10:07,197 --> 01:10:10,030
And if the kids cut it back on,
knock them out.

1111
01:10:10,133 --> 01:10:11,566
That's why l don't smoke.

1112
01:10:11,635 --> 01:10:14,035
When l was a kid,
my daddy caught me smoking...

1113
01:10:14,104 --> 01:10:15,662
and he knocked me out!

1114
01:10:15,839 --> 01:10:19,240
And to this day, l don't smoke.
Not because l'm scared of cancer.

1115
01:10:19,309 --> 01:10:22,801
I don't smoke because l think my dad
is going to walk through that door...

1116
01:10:22,879 --> 01:10:24,904
and knock me the hell out!

1117
01:10:25,282 --> 01:10:27,409
Knock out your kids. It helps.

1118
01:10:36,493 --> 01:10:38,120
Vice President Lewis...

1119
01:10:38,228 --> 01:10:42,096
with over 10,000 gun deaths per year
in the United States...

1120
01:10:42,632 --> 01:10:45,328
do you believe we need
stricter gun control laws?

1121
01:10:45,435 --> 01:10:47,596
I don't think we need more gun control.

1122
01:10:47,671 --> 01:10:50,765
I say we enforce the laws
that are already on the books.

1123
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,673
The problem is, nobody reads the books.

1124
01:10:53,743 --> 01:10:56,769
We need to start putting laws on videos...

1125
01:10:56,846 --> 01:10:59,974
because everybody watches videos,
MTV, BET.

1126
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:02,610
We need to put some laws
on the Nelly video.

1127
01:11:02,886 --> 01:11:07,755
If you had laws on a Destiny's Child video
right now, you could stop crime.

1128
01:11:07,824 --> 01:11:11,385
-We already have gun licensing.
-But that's only to carry the gun.

1129
01:11:11,461 --> 01:11:12,985
Let the people decide.

1130
01:11:13,096 --> 01:11:16,657
The people can't decide. The people
are too busy getting shot in the ass.

1131
01:11:36,386 --> 01:11:37,614
That's my brother.

1132
01:11:37,687 --> 01:11:40,417
That's another reason he's not qualified.

1133
01:11:40,557 --> 01:11:44,152
Because l had the good sense to pick
my big brother to be my running mate?

1134
01:11:44,327 --> 01:11:46,386
I didn't come here to argue with you.

1135
01:11:46,463 --> 01:11:50,092
Yes, you did. We're having a debate.
A debate ain't nothing but an argument.

1136
01:11:50,166 --> 01:11:51,827
A debate isn't an argument.

1137
01:11:52,002 --> 01:11:54,163
-Yes, it is.
-No, it isn't.

1138
01:11:54,904 --> 01:11:57,099
-Yes, it is.
-No, it isn't.

1139
01:11:57,774 --> 01:11:59,867
I know you are, but what am l?

1140
01:12:07,017 --> 01:12:09,577
Can we just move on? This is ridiculous.

1141
01:12:09,652 --> 01:12:10,983
Our next question comes from--

1142
01:12:11,054 --> 01:12:12,180
I have a question.

1143
01:12:12,789 --> 01:12:16,384
Would you like our reception
to be buffet style or formal seating?

1144
01:12:16,493 --> 01:12:18,518
If you put Robert next to Nelson...

1145
01:12:18,595 --> 01:12:21,689
he'll be very angry
because he wanted to be your best man.

1146
01:12:21,765 --> 01:12:23,596
Security.

1147
01:12:23,666 --> 01:12:25,190
I love you so much--

1148
01:12:26,569 --> 01:12:29,367
The candidates have agreed upon
a short closing speech.

1149
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:32,533
Vice President Lewis won the coin toss.

1150
01:12:32,609 --> 01:12:34,270
He has elected to go first.

1151
01:12:34,444 --> 01:12:35,706
Thank you.

1152
01:12:36,679 --> 01:12:38,738
-No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is!

1153
01:12:39,215 --> 01:12:42,742
Tonight you have seen two different men...

1154
01:12:42,919 --> 01:12:46,719
with two very different points of view,
battle to win your vote.

1155
01:12:47,524 --> 01:12:49,958
And this is what America is all about.

1156
01:12:51,027 --> 01:12:52,824
As we've seen tonight...

1157
01:12:52,962 --> 01:12:57,456
Alderman Gilliam
can be captivating and entertaining.

1158
01:12:58,301 --> 01:13:01,828
But America needs more than that
from its Commander in Chief.

1159
01:13:02,205 --> 01:13:05,231
To lead America, it takes experience.

1160
01:13:05,542 --> 01:13:08,943
Now, l've been Vice President
for the last eight years.

1161
01:13:09,579 --> 01:13:13,481
I'm a war hero,
and l'm Sharon Stone's cousin.

1162
01:13:14,884 --> 01:13:18,820
And to me,
America is like a fine performance car.

1163
01:13:19,556 --> 01:13:22,150
And now is not the time...

1164
01:13:22,659 --> 01:13:25,560
to turn this fine vehicle we call America..

1165
01:13:26,029 --> 01:13:28,463
over to the hands of an amateur.

1166
01:13:31,401 --> 01:13:35,098
I'm Brian Lewis, and l am your last chance.

1167
01:13:36,106 --> 01:13:39,200
God bless America, and no place else.

1168
01:13:44,247 --> 01:13:46,738
Yeah, it's over now.

1169
01:13:47,784 --> 01:13:49,649
Why do you have to be so negative?

1170
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:51,882
Give me five.

1171
01:13:51,955 --> 01:13:53,183
Thank you.

1172
01:13:55,525 --> 01:13:56,856
Hold it!

1173
01:14:08,438 --> 01:14:11,737
You're right, Vice President Lewis.
I am an amateur.

1174
01:14:12,275 --> 01:14:14,436
When it comes to creating
so many enemies...

1175
01:14:14,511 --> 01:14:18,709
that we need billions of dollars
to protect ourselves, l'm an amateur.

1176
01:14:18,815 --> 01:14:21,682
When it comes to paying farmers
not to grow food...

1177
01:14:21,751 --> 01:14:25,209
while people in this country
starve every day, l'm an amateur.

1178
01:14:25,288 --> 01:14:29,452
When it comes to creating a drug policy
that makes crack and heroin...

1179
01:14:29,526 --> 01:14:33,018
cheaper than asthma and AIDS medicine,
l'm an amateur.

1180
01:14:33,096 --> 01:14:35,496
But there's nothing wrong
with being an amateur.

1181
01:14:35,565 --> 01:14:38,898
The people that started
the Underground Railroad were amateurs.

1182
01:14:38,968 --> 01:14:41,402
Martin Luther King was an amateur.

1183
01:14:41,804 --> 01:14:44,398
Have you ever been to Amateur Night
at the Apollo?

1184
01:14:44,474 --> 01:14:46,669
Some of the world's best talent was there:

1185
01:14:46,743 --> 01:14:51,237
James Brown, Luther Vandross, Rockwell,
the Crown Heights Affair.

1186
01:14:51,314 --> 01:14:54,147
-Hall and Oates!
-The Fat Boys, Rob Base.

1187
01:14:54,217 --> 01:14:56,685
But you wouldn't know
nothing about that. Why?

1188
01:14:56,753 --> 01:14:59,551
Because when it comes to judging
talent and potential...

1189
01:14:59,622 --> 01:15:01,886
you, my friend, are an amateur!

1190
01:15:07,497 --> 01:15:11,934
-I believe the Alderman is over his time.
-You had eight years to talk.

1191
01:15:12,001 --> 01:15:15,266
Now it's my turn. I'm getting mine!

1192
01:15:17,473 --> 01:15:19,964
Ladies and gentlemen,
hold your applause, please.

1193
01:15:20,043 --> 01:15:22,773
How can you help the poor
if you never been poor?

1194
01:15:22,845 --> 01:15:26,303
How can you stop crime
if you don't know no criminals?

1195
01:15:26,382 --> 01:15:30,876
How can you make drug policy
if you never smoked a chronic?

1196
01:15:31,854 --> 01:15:34,550
How can you do that? Just a nickel bag!

1197
01:15:35,158 --> 01:15:36,921
I'm a real American.

1198
01:15:36,993 --> 01:15:41,089
I've been high, l've been robbed,
l've been broke.

1199
01:15:41,197 --> 01:15:45,657
My credit is horrible!
They won't even take my cash!

1200
01:15:46,202 --> 01:15:50,332
You're always talking about,
"God bless America, and no place else."

1201
01:15:50,406 --> 01:15:53,170
But isn't it obvious
that God has blessed America?

1202
01:15:53,243 --> 01:15:56,838
America is the richest,
most powerful nation on earth.

1203
01:15:57,247 --> 01:16:01,581
If America was a woman,
it would be a big-titty woman.

1204
01:16:01,651 --> 01:16:04,279
And everybody loves a big-titty woman!

1205
01:16:04,687 --> 01:16:06,314
So, in closing...

1206
01:16:06,389 --> 01:16:09,085
I'd like to say you are full of shit.

1207
01:16:10,593 --> 01:16:13,391
"God bless America, and no place else."

1208
01:16:13,463 --> 01:16:16,955
How about "God bless Haiti"
or "God bless Africa"?

1209
01:16:17,033 --> 01:16:18,864
How about "God bless Jamaica"?

1210
01:16:18,935 --> 01:16:22,530
I'm not talking about Jamaica,
the beach tribes you all love.

1211
01:16:22,605 --> 01:16:26,473
I'm talking about stabbing Jamaica
That's what l'm talking about.

1212
01:16:26,542 --> 01:16:31,445
So, tonight l want to say:
"God bless America, and everybody else!"

1213
01:16:31,948 --> 01:16:34,143
The whole world! God bless you!

1214
01:16:34,217 --> 01:16:38,711
I'm Mays Gilliam, and l'm running for
President of the United States of America

1215
01:16:38,888 --> 01:16:40,116
Ya heard?

1216
01:17:02,745 --> 01:17:04,713
Now we can watch Martin!

1217
01:17:17,948 --> 01:17:20,974
-Hello?
-Good morning, Mr. President.

1218
01:17:22,619 --> 01:17:25,918
-What time is it?
-I think it's a little after 7:00.

1219
01:17:26,256 --> 01:17:29,748
-Lisa, l need some help in here!
-Will you wait a damn minute?

1220
01:17:30,093 --> 01:17:33,290
I was so proud ofyou.
You were so good last night.

1221
01:17:35,565 --> 01:17:39,899
Tonight, no matter what, win or lose,
l want to see you.

1222
01:17:39,970 --> 01:17:42,200
I don't know. I might have to work.

1223
01:17:42,272 --> 01:17:44,797
But if l don't see you tonight,
l will see you soon.

1224
01:17:44,874 --> 01:17:49,004
Just run your race, get out there,
and do what you got to do, okay?

1225
01:17:49,179 --> 01:17:51,943
-I'll talk to you later. Bye.
-All right.

1226
01:17:52,482 --> 01:17:55,918
It's Election Day, Tuesday,
November 8, 2004.

1227
01:17:55,986 --> 01:17:57,851
The stage is set for what will be...

1228
01:17:57,921 --> 01:18:00,788
one of the most dramatic campaign finaIes
of aIl time.

1229
01:18:00,857 --> 01:18:04,452
The question everyone's asking is.:
"Who will America vote for?"

1230
01:18:05,128 --> 01:18:06,755
I voted for Mays Gilliam.

1231
01:18:06,830 --> 01:18:09,526
-I voted for big business.
-I voted for Lewis.

1232
01:18:09,633 --> 01:18:12,261
Who the fuck you think l'm voting for?

1233
01:18:12,702 --> 01:18:14,499
There seems to be an agreement...

1234
01:18:14,571 --> 01:18:17,972
between Washington, D.C., officiaIs
and transit authority operators...

1235
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:20,737
regarding the shutdown
of the 9th Ward bus line.

1236
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:23,472
I don't see how they could do this to us.

1237
01:18:23,546 --> 01:18:26,879
People got to make money and get to work.

1238
01:18:27,417 --> 01:18:32,354
-Show them how you do it.
-The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire

1239
01:18:32,422 --> 01:18:35,653
You're not gonna believe this.
We got the Teamsters!

1240
01:18:35,725 --> 01:18:39,456
-That's great, little brother!
-They'll announce it at a press conference.

1241
01:18:39,529 --> 01:18:42,157
You just have to go,
shake hands, take photographs...

1242
01:18:42,232 --> 01:18:43,995
but it is yours.

1243
01:18:46,403 --> 01:18:47,529
What's the matter?

1244
01:18:47,604 --> 01:18:51,404
If they shut down this bus service,
l will drive you to work myself.

1245
01:18:52,475 --> 01:18:55,103
-I can't do it.
-But it's Election Day!

1246
01:18:55,178 --> 01:18:58,011
You have to get the endorsement.
You said you want to win.

1247
01:18:58,081 --> 01:19:01,175
You can't snub the Teamsters.
You want them to endorse Lewis?

1248
01:19:01,251 --> 01:19:04,015
I'm not worried about Lewis.
I'm running my race.

1249
01:19:04,087 --> 01:19:06,555
Go ahead, baby brother. I got this.

1250
01:19:08,558 --> 01:19:11,356
-You're just gonna let him go?
-He's a grown man.

1251
01:19:11,428 --> 01:19:15,262
They shut down the whole bus line.
What can he do about that?

1252
01:19:24,107 --> 01:19:28,407
In the latest exit poll, Vice President Lewis
has 51 percent of the vote.

1253
01:19:28,478 --> 01:19:30,173
Bring him back. He got to vote.

1254
01:19:30,246 --> 01:19:33,738
...while Mays Gilliam
is posting an impressive 47 percent.

1255
01:19:34,984 --> 01:19:37,111
You gotta get to the back of the bus.

1256
01:19:37,187 --> 01:19:38,950
I'm just playing. Come on.

1257
01:19:39,322 --> 01:19:43,224
Now, he and Vice President Lewis
are in a statisticaI dead heat.

1258
01:19:43,293 --> 01:19:44,783
Come on, hoes!

1259
01:19:44,894 --> 01:19:49,092
While Lewis and Mitch Gilliam
have been working the campaign trail...

1260
01:19:49,365 --> 01:19:52,493
Mays Gilliam has been out
driving people to work.

1261
01:19:54,904 --> 01:19:57,873
Damn it! Why didn't somebody around here
think of this?

1262
01:19:57,941 --> 01:20:00,466
Why am l not out there driving a damn bus?

1263
01:20:00,543 --> 01:20:03,842
Get me an SUV, a minivan, a bus,
a scooter...

1264
01:20:03,913 --> 01:20:06,006
a motorcycle, or a rickshaw.

1265
01:20:06,082 --> 01:20:07,549
Get me some wheels, bitch!

1266
01:20:08,918 --> 01:20:10,715
Are you going uptown?

1267
01:20:11,988 --> 01:20:13,853
Come on. Wait a minute!

1268
01:20:15,158 --> 01:20:17,285
We could write our own vows!

1269
01:20:18,161 --> 01:20:21,062
I love you, Mays!

1270
01:20:22,499 --> 01:20:26,060
With the polls about 30 minutes
from closing on the East Coast...

1271
01:20:26,136 --> 01:20:29,799
Mays Gilliam is actually ahead
by several points.

1272
01:20:32,408 --> 01:20:34,968
There is no question that Lewis has Texas.

1273
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:40,079
It seems clear
Gilliam is going to take New York.

1274
01:20:44,454 --> 01:20:45,443
New York!

1275
01:20:45,522 --> 01:20:47,581
It's likely Lewis will take Michigan.

1276
01:20:49,425 --> 01:20:53,361
It looks like Gilliam
might just pull an upset in Illinois.

1277
01:20:55,165 --> 01:20:56,632
Illinois!

1278
01:20:57,634 --> 01:20:58,601
Go, Mays!

1279
01:20:58,668 --> 01:21:01,364
This looks like
it may come down to California

1280
01:21:01,437 --> 01:21:04,031
This looks like
it may come down to California

1281
01:21:04,107 --> 01:21:06,598
This looks like
it may come down to California

1282
01:21:08,545 --> 01:21:12,003
I need to know. How real is this?
Can we win without California?

1283
01:21:12,081 --> 01:21:15,642
We stand a chance if you call
your connections to the energy companies--

1284
01:21:15,718 --> 01:21:18,312
No, you can't win without California

1285
01:21:18,454 --> 01:21:19,887
What are you doing here?

1286
01:21:19,956 --> 01:21:23,289
Shut up. You want to win,
you'll do what l tell you.

1287
01:21:23,693 --> 01:21:26,594
Gilliam has
over 90 percent minority turnout.

1288
01:21:26,663 --> 01:21:30,861
Whites are the majority,
but they're not voting. They don't like you.

1289
01:21:31,167 --> 01:21:33,192
-I like you, sir.
-Shut up.

1290
01:21:33,736 --> 01:21:35,431
How can we turn this around?

1291
01:21:35,505 --> 01:21:38,906
There's about one and a half hours left
at the West Coast polls.

1292
01:21:38,975 --> 01:21:42,741
If there's a leak saying Gilliam
is going to win, you'll get a late rush.

1293
01:21:42,812 --> 01:21:45,610
You get California, you get the election.

1294
01:21:46,649 --> 01:21:51,313
It will make the 6:30 news if we do it now.
We just have to put it out there.

1295
01:21:51,387 --> 01:21:54,652
-Can we do this?
-We're the government. We can do anything.

1296
01:21:55,592 --> 01:21:58,356
The race for President
now turns to the West Coast.

1297
01:21:58,428 --> 01:22:01,420
People, Armageddon is upon us
and Big Dave is scared.

1298
01:22:01,497 --> 01:22:05,934
If these voting trends sustain,
it's likely that for the first time in history...

1299
01:22:06,002 --> 01:22:10,063
a black man will become
President of the United States ofAmerica.

1300
01:22:46,276 --> 01:22:49,973
"l have a dream that one day...

1301
01:22:51,748 --> 01:22:54,114
"this nation will rise up...

1302
01:22:55,418 --> 01:22:58,353
"and live out the true meaning of its creed.:

1303
01:22:59,255 --> 01:23:02,418
"'We hold these truths to be self-evident.:

1304
01:23:02,659 --> 01:23:04,991
"'that aIl men are created equaI. "'

1305
01:23:05,962 --> 01:23:06,951
Checkmate.

1306
01:23:07,030 --> 01:23:09,430
I, Richard Nixon, do solemnly swear....

1307
01:23:09,499 --> 01:23:11,694
I, RonaId Reagan, do solemnly swear....

1308
01:23:18,706 --> 01:23:20,537
The race for President is over.

1309
01:23:22,076 --> 01:23:23,600
The election is now over.

1310
01:23:23,678 --> 01:23:26,044
-The race for President....
-...is over.

1311
01:23:28,649 --> 01:23:30,674
The race for President is over.

1312
01:23:31,052 --> 01:23:35,113
For the first time in history,
a black man, Mays Gilliam...

1313
01:23:35,856 --> 01:23:39,690
will be the next President
of the United States ofAmerica.

1314
01:23:58,846 --> 01:24:00,507
Come here, brother.

1315
01:24:03,150 --> 01:24:05,243
-I love you, man!
-I love you, too.

1316
01:24:14,295 --> 01:24:16,525
I appreciate it. Thanks a lot.

1317
01:24:19,233 --> 01:24:20,564
Thank you.

1318
01:24:23,170 --> 01:24:26,071
We won! Aren't you happy?

1319
01:24:26,507 --> 01:24:28,566
-Can l have a massage?
-Yes!

1320
01:24:28,976 --> 01:24:30,841
I won!

1321
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:36,081
There is no way in the world
l could have ever done this without you.

1322
01:24:36,150 --> 01:24:37,344
You're damn right.

1323
01:24:37,418 --> 01:24:40,444
We won! We did it! Yes!

1324
01:24:42,356 --> 01:24:44,290
Look at my little brother!

1325
01:24:44,358 --> 01:24:48,055
-Boy, l'm proud of you! Mr. President!
-Mr. Vice President.

1326
01:24:48,162 --> 01:24:52,622
You're the man! You ain't got to worry about
no assassinations or nothing.

1327
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:55,134
They sure don't want me
to be the next President.

1328
01:24:55,202 --> 01:24:57,397
You can raise taxes, start a war....

1329
01:24:57,471 --> 01:24:59,200
Mays Gilliam began this race....

1330
01:24:59,273 --> 01:25:02,208
That's my man!

1331
01:25:04,145 --> 01:25:05,806
Excuse me, please.

1332
01:25:07,515 --> 01:25:09,983
-I've been looking for you.
-I was looking for you.

1333
01:25:10,050 --> 01:25:12,541
-This is amazing!
-It's amazing.

1334
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:14,417
It's incredible.

1335
01:25:14,488 --> 01:25:16,581
-What you were up against.
-The odds!

1336
01:25:16,657 --> 01:25:20,024
I can't wait to start working,
and do l have a job for you!

1337
01:25:20,828 --> 01:25:24,696
I don't know what to say. What department
do you want me to work in? Finance?

1338
01:25:24,765 --> 01:25:27,825
No, that's not good enough for you.

1339
01:25:27,902 --> 01:25:30,302
-Foreign Affairs?
-No, not Foreign Affairs.

1340
01:25:30,371 --> 01:25:33,568
I thought you could do
something real good in Security!

1341
01:25:34,475 --> 01:25:35,737
You suck!

1342
01:25:40,781 --> 01:25:43,978
We'd like you to run for President.

1343
01:25:44,385 --> 01:25:47,684
Sometimes, you don't know
ifpeople like you for you.

1344
01:25:48,122 --> 01:25:49,885
I like you for you.

1345
01:25:50,157 --> 01:25:51,647
Thanks a lot.

1346
01:25:54,094 --> 01:25:56,426
Get your hand off my ass, boy!

1347
01:25:57,965 --> 01:25:59,091
Wait!

1348
01:26:02,736 --> 01:26:05,933
Oh, my God, you are everywhere.
Look at you!

1349
01:26:08,509 --> 01:26:11,376
What's the first thing
you're going to do, Mr. President?

1350
01:26:11,445 --> 01:26:14,642
The first thing l'll do
is make you my First Lady.

1351
01:26:15,449 --> 01:26:18,145
-Don't you play with me like that.
-I'm not playing.

1352
01:26:18,219 --> 01:26:19,413
You can't do that!

1353
01:26:19,487 --> 01:26:22,081
I'm the government. I can do anything.

1354
01:26:38,839 --> 01:26:39,965
Get ready for...

1355
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:44,067
the 2005 PresidentiaI lnauguraI BaIl.

1356
01:26:44,211 --> 01:26:48,910
Ladies and gentlemen, the President
of the United States of America..

1357
01:26:48,983 --> 01:26:52,851
Mays Gilliam, and his future First Wifey...

1358
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:54,478
Lisa Clark!

1359
01:27:06,667 --> 01:27:08,965
Look at him now, man
Ain't this great

1360
01:27:09,036 --> 01:27:11,197
Biggest man in town
He's the head ofstate

1361
01:27:11,272 --> 01:27:13,763
They come from aIl around
just for one handshake

1362
01:27:13,841 --> 01:27:17,038
Look at him now
He's the head ofstate

1363
01:27:23,217 --> 01:27:26,015
That's me, Mays Gilliam...

1364
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:28,987
President of the United States ofAmerica.

1365
01:27:29,390 --> 01:27:30,810
North America.

1366
01:27:37,950 --> 01:27:39,679
-Who did you vote for?
-For what?

1367
01:27:39,752 --> 01:27:41,276
-For President.
-Of what?

1368
01:27:41,354 --> 01:27:43,720
-Of the United States.
-Of what?

1369
01:27:43,789 --> 01:27:45,518
-Of America
-What America?

1370
01:27:45,591 --> 01:27:46,717
North America

1371
01:27:46,792 --> 01:27:49,818
Slick, l don't vote.
You gonna buy some of this meat, or what?

1372
01:27:50,029 --> 01:27:54,523
You can't trust nobody.
Everybody's trying to rob you. Nobody!

1373
01:27:54,634 --> 01:27:57,068
That guy right there! Don't trust him!

1374
01:27:57,136 --> 01:27:58,967
Can't trust no-damn-body!

1375
01:27:59,038 --> 01:28:01,632
America is taking advantage of you!

1376
01:28:01,774 --> 01:28:06,404
You can go to war when you're 18,
but you can't have a drink till you're 21 !

1377
01:28:06,612 --> 01:28:09,843
-That ain't right!
-Right! So, let me get this straight.

1378
01:28:09,915 --> 01:28:12,213
You're 18 years old. You go to war.

1379
01:28:12,284 --> 01:28:14,718
You come back. Your leg is chopped off!

1380
01:28:14,787 --> 01:28:16,482
You got a damn nub!

1381
01:28:16,555 --> 01:28:19,046
Everywhere you go they say,
"What's up, nubby?"

1382
01:28:19,125 --> 01:28:22,583
You get to the bar and say,
"Bartender, can l have a drink?"

1383
01:28:22,662 --> 01:28:26,359
He looks you up and down and says,
"l got to see some ID."

1384
01:28:26,432 --> 01:28:31,131
ID? You mean to tell me
a one-legged teenager can't have a drink?

1385
01:28:31,303 --> 01:28:34,864
-That ain't right!
-Where is the nub?

1386
01:28:34,974 --> 01:28:39,274
Prescription drugs, l'll lower the prices.
Let me explain something else to you.

1387
01:28:39,345 --> 01:28:40,937
You can survive a stroke...

1388
01:28:41,013 --> 01:28:44,449
but the high prices of medicine
will give you a heart attack.

1389
01:28:44,517 --> 01:28:48,248
America is the richest,
most powerful nation on earth.

1390
01:28:48,354 --> 01:28:52,381
If America was a car, it would be a Bentley...

1391
01:28:52,458 --> 01:28:56,918
sitting on chrome doves,
with TVs in the headrests...

1392
01:28:56,996 --> 01:29:00,454
and a fine, naked Puerto Rican girl
feeding you grapes!

1393
01:29:00,733 --> 01:29:04,294
Ain't nothing better than that!
Ain't nothing ever been better than that!

1394
01:29:04,370 --> 01:29:08,534
Most opponents are saying your brother
destroyed any chance of winning...
