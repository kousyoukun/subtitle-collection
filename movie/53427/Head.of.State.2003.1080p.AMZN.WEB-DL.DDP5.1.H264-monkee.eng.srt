Can we just move on?
This is ridiculous.

MODERATOR:
Gentlemen,

1902
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,977
our next question comes from...

1903
01:12:09,977 --> 01:12:11,239
I have a question.

1904
01:12:11,239 --> 01:12:12,632
Would you like our reception

1905
01:12:12,632 --> 01:12:14,721
to be buffet style
or formal seating?

1906
01:12:14,721 --> 01:12:16,680
Now, keep in mind,
if you put Robert
next to Nelson,

1907
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,986
he's going to be very angry
because he wanted

1908
01:12:18,986 --> 01:12:20,771
to be your best man, darling.Security.

1909
01:12:20,771 --> 01:12:22,294
Security.Security!

1910
01:12:22,294 --> 01:12:23,556
I love you so much...

[ tires screeching]

1912
01:12:25,297 --> 01:12:28,344
The candidates have agreed
upon a short closing speech.

1913
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,215
Vice President Lewis

1914
01:12:30,215 --> 01:12:31,477
won the coin toss.

1915
01:12:31,477 --> 01:12:33,218
He has elected to go first.

1916
01:12:33,218 --> 01:12:34,480
Thank you.

1917
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,177
No, it isn't.

1918
01:12:36,177 --> 01:12:37,614
Yes, it is.

1919
01:12:37,614 --> 01:12:41,444
Tonight, you have seen
two different men

1920
01:12:41,444 --> 01:12:45,186
with two very different points
of view battle to win your vote.

1921
01:12:45,186 --> 01:12:49,147
And this is what America
is all about.

1922
01:12:49,147 --> 01:12:52,803
Now, as we've seen tonight,
Alderman Gilliam

1923
01:12:52,803 --> 01:12:57,024
can be captivating
and... and entertaining.

1924
01:12:57,024 --> 01:12:59,331
But America needs
more than that

1925
01:12:59,331 --> 01:13:01,159
from its
commander in chief.

1926
01:13:01,159 --> 01:13:04,075
To lead America,
it takes experience.

1927
01:13:04,075 --> 01:13:07,687
Now, I've been Vice President
for the last eight years.

1928
01:13:07,687 --> 01:13:12,344
I'm a war hero...
and I'm Sharon Stone's cousin.

1929
01:13:12,344 --> 01:13:13,650
And to me,

1930
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:16,435
America is like
a fine performance car.

1931
01:13:16,435 --> 01:13:18,742
And now is not the time...

1932
01:13:18,742 --> 01:13:22,528
to turn this fine vehicle
we call America

1933
01:13:22,528 --> 01:13:25,836
over to the hands of an amateur.

1934
01:13:28,752 --> 01:13:33,191
I'm Brian Lewis...
and I am your last chance.

1935
01:13:33,191 --> 01:13:37,456
God bless America,
and no place else.

Ah, yeah, it's over now.

1939
01:13:45,246 --> 01:13:48,032
Why do you have
to be so negative?

MODERATOR:
Alderman Gilliam?

1949
01:14:06,354 --> 01:14:08,182
Well, you're right,
Vice President Lewis.

1950
01:14:08,182 --> 01:14:10,010
I am an amateur.

1951
01:14:10,010 --> 01:14:12,665
When it comes to creating
so many enemies that we need

1952
01:14:12,665 --> 01:14:16,408
billions of dollars to protect
ourselves, yes, I'm an amateur.

1953
01:14:16,408 --> 01:14:19,672
When it comes to paying
farmers not to grow food

1954
01:14:19,672 --> 01:14:21,457
while people in this country
starve every day,

1955
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,110
yes, I'm an amateur.

1956
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:25,852
When it comes to creating
a drug policy that makes

1957
01:14:25,852 --> 01:14:29,552
crack and heroin cheaper
than asthma and AIDS medicine,

1958
01:14:29,552 --> 01:14:31,554
yes, I'm an amateur.

1959
01:14:31,554 --> 01:14:33,599
But there's nothing wrong
with being an amateur.

1960
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,819
The people that started
the Underground Railroad

1961
01:14:35,819 --> 01:14:37,168
were amateurs.

1962
01:14:37,168 --> 01:14:39,475
Martin Luther King
was an amateur.

1963
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:42,652
Have you ever been to Amateur
Night at the Apollo?

1964
01:14:42,652 --> 01:14:44,741
Some of the best talent
in the world was there.

1965
01:14:44,741 --> 01:14:46,830
James Brown, Luther Vandross,

1966
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:49,136
Rockwell,
the Crown Heights Affair...

1967
01:14:49,136 --> 01:14:50,398
Hall and Oates!

1968
01:14:50,398 --> 01:14:52,270
...the Fat Boys,
Rob Base.

1969
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:54,707
But you wouldn't know
nothing about that. Why?

1970
01:14:54,707 --> 01:14:57,449
'Cause when it comes to judging
talent and potential,

1971
01:14:57,449 --> 01:14:59,973
you, my friend, are an amateur.

1972

[ applause]

1973
01:15:05,152 --> 01:15:07,415
I believe the Alderman
is over his time.

1974
01:15:07,415 --> 01:15:09,330
No, you don't.
You had eight years to talk.

1975
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:11,507
Now is my turn.

1976
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,509
I'm gonna get mine.
I'm getting mine!

MODERATOR:
Ladies and gentlemen,

1979
01:15:16,599 --> 01:15:18,644
hold your applause, please.

1980
01:15:18,644 --> 01:15:21,517
How can you help the poor
if you never been poor?

1981
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:24,520
How can you stop crime if you
don't know no criminals?

1982
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,391
How can you make
drug policy

1983
01:15:26,391 --> 01:15:29,394
if you never smoked
a chronic?

1984
01:15:29,394 --> 01:15:31,614
How can you do that?

1985
01:15:31,614 --> 01:15:33,137
Just a nickel bag.

1986
01:15:33,137 --> 01:15:35,487
I'’m a real American.

1987
01:15:35,487 --> 01:15:39,317
I've been high, I'’ve been
robbed, I've been broke.

1988
01:15:39,317 --> 01:15:41,754
My credit is horrible.

1989
01:15:41,754 --> 01:15:44,931
They won't even
take my cash!

1990
01:15:44,931 --> 01:15:46,454
Now, you're always
talking about

1991
01:15:46,454 --> 01:15:48,892
"God bless America,
and no place else,"

1992
01:15:48,892 --> 01:15:51,721
but isn't it obvious that
God has blessed America?

1993
01:15:51,721 --> 01:15:55,420
America is the richest,
most powerful nation on Earth.

1994
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,335
If America was a woman,

1995
01:15:57,335 --> 01:15:59,946
America would be
a big-titted woman.

1996
01:15:59,946 --> 01:16:02,732
And everybody loves
a big-titted woman.

1997
01:16:02,732 --> 01:16:05,648
So in closing,
I'’d like to say

1998
01:16:05,648 --> 01:16:07,301
you are full of shit.

1999
01:16:08,912 --> 01:16:11,784
"God bless America
and no place else."

2000
01:16:11,784 --> 01:16:13,656
How about "God bless Haiti"?

2001
01:16:13,656 --> 01:16:15,483
How about
"God bless Africa"?

2002
01:16:15,483 --> 01:16:16,920
How about "God bless Jamaica"?

2003
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,965
I'm not talking
about Jamaica,

2004
01:16:18,965 --> 01:16:20,706

That's what I'm talking about.
