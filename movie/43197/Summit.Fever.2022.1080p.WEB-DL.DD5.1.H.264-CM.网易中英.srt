00:10:31,432 --> 00:10:33,839
他在猎户座星面上设置了一条新路线。
He put up a new route on the Orion Face.

150
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:35,940
猎户座的脸吗?从来没听说过。
Orion Face? Never heard of it.

151
00:10:35,975 --> 00:10:37,172
在本尼维斯岛上。
It's on Ben Nevis.

152
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:40,780
我去过一次苏格兰。我再也不会见你了。
I did Scotland once. Never again.

153
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:42,848
谁会在这种天气爬山啊?
Who the hell climbs in weather like that?

154
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:45,917
是啊，太阳出来的时候傻瓜都能爬。
Yeah, well, any fool can climb when the sun's out.

155
00:10:45,952 --> 00:10:47,182
我们将会看到。
We'll see.

156
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,793
[迈克尔]我能感觉到海拔。
[Michael] I can feel the altitude.

157
00:10:53,828 --> 00:10:55,619
(笑)我是说，拜托。
[laughs] I mean, come on.

158
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:58,732
你刚在20分钟内登上了珠穆朗玛峰的三分之一。
You just ascended a third of Mount Everest in 20 minutes.

159
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:01,999
推进,老兄。过几天，你甚至都不会注意到。
Push through, man. Couple of days, you won't even notice it.

160
00:11:02,034 --> 00:11:03,033
(普通员工)
[grunts]

161
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:11,338
啊，<i> au revoir，</i>王八蛋!
Ah,<i> au revoir,</i> motherfuckers!

162
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:12,636
Yee-hoo !是安全的。
Yee-hoo! Be safe.

163
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,374
<我>再会。< / i > <我>很好。< / i >
<i>Au revoir.</i> <i>Tres bien.</i>

164
00:11:19,183 --> 00:11:20,952
嘿!Isa。
Hey! Isa.

165
00:11:20,987 --> 00:11:23,251
(说法语)
[speaking French]

166
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:30,027
迈克尔，这是伊莎贝尔。她是我们中的一员。
Hey, Michael, this is Isabelle. She's one of us.

167
00:11:30,062 --> 00:11:31,523
不过我不太会爬。
Not much of a climber, though.

168
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,195
而且你也不太会滑雪。
And you're not much of a skier.

169
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,966
哦。(亲吻的声音)
Ooh. [kissing noises]

170
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:36,660
[亲吻声][JP咯咯地笑]
[kissing noise] [JP chuckles]

171
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,497
(说法语)
[speaking French]

172
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:39,729
第一天?
First day?

173
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:41,236
是的。(裤子)(Isabelle笑)
Yeah. [pants] [Isabelle laughs]

174
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,501
我看得出来。
I can see that.

175
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,140
(迈克尔,伊莎贝尔笑)
[Michael, Isabelle laugh]

176
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:45,944
他习惯了在苏格兰爬鼹鼠丘。
He's used to climbing molehills in Scotland.

177
00:11:45,979 --> 00:11:47,638
(嘲笑)和威尔士。
[scoffs] And Wales.

178
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,640
和威尔士。是啊，他才知道
And Wales. Yeah, he's just finding out

179
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,049
稀薄的空气是什么味道，仅此而已。
what thin air tastes like, that's all.

180
00:11:52,084 --> 00:11:54,579
(说法语)
[speaking French]

181
00:11:56,451 --> 00:11:59,320
我们来看看英国人在高空是如何应对的。
We're gonna see how the Englishman copes at altitude.

182
00:11:59,355 --> 00:12:00,717
(笑)
[laughs]

183
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:03,687
好了。祝你好运，注意安全。
All righty. Well, good luck and be safe.

184
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,260
(狮子座)你。(迈克尔)谢谢。
[Leo] You too. [Michael] Thanks.

185
00:12:05,295 --> 00:12:07,559
(说法语)
[speaking French]

186
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:08,769
(说法语)
[speaking French]

187
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:36,390
嘿，这太慢了，迈克尔。即使是你。来吧。
Hey, this is slow, Michael. Even for you. Come on.

188
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:40,130
我还没适应。给我休息。
I haven't acclimatized yet. Gimme a break.

189
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:43,870
[笑]
[chuckles]

190
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:55,574
迈克尔，别习惯这些小石头。
[JP] Don't get used to these baby rocks, Michael.

191
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,543
你在马特洪峰上是找不到他们的。
You won't find them on the Matterhorn.

192
00:12:57,578 --> 00:12:59,281
(迈克尔)大便。好吧，那我最好回家了。
[Michael] Shit. Well, I'd better go home then.

193
00:12:59,316 --> 00:13:01,811
太晚了，宝贝!我抓住你了。
[JP] Too late, baby! I got you now.

194
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:03,747
Whoo-hoo !(回声)
Whoo-hoo! [echoes]

195
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,860
嘿，亲爱的，JP爬得比你快。
[Natascha] Hey, honey, JP's climbing faster than you.

196
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:11,227
如果他想超过你，就把他推开。
If he tries to pass you, push him off.

197
00:13:11,262 --> 00:13:12,965
我会说那是个意外。
I'll say it was an accident.

198
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:29,212
好了，我们走吧。
All right, let's go.

199
00:13:30,182 --> 00:13:31,775
嘿,迈克尔,
Hey, Michael,

200
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,381
看看你脚下，伙计!
look beneath your feet, man!

201
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:35,680
Yee-hoo-hoo !
Yee-hoo-hoo!

202
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:38,155
等等，等等，等等!
[JP] Wait, wait, wait, wait!

203
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,620
(快门点击)是啊!
[shutter clicks] Yeah!

204
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,963
真不错，我的朋友。
That's a keeper, my friend.

205
00:13:44,966 --> 00:13:46,823
你不想等JP和迈克尔吗?
You don't wanna wait for JP and Michael?

206
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:49,298
我需要一杯啤酒。(笑)
I need a beer. [laughs]

207
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,498
据我所知，这里没有酒吧。
There's no bar up here last I checked.

208
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,435
他们会迎头赶上。好的。
They'll catch up. Okay.

209
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,866
好吧，年龄先于美丽。
Well, age before beauty.

210
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:58,637
Mwah。(笑)
Mwah. [laughs]

211
00:14:14,358 --> 00:14:17,392
来吧,米奇。最后几个步骤。差不多了。
Come on, Mikey. Last few steps. Almost there.

212
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:21,099
呵呵呵,是的!
Heh heh, yeah!

213
00:14:21,134 --> 00:14:22,298
(叹息)
[sighs]

214
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:24,102
是的。
Yeah.

215
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:26,830
Whoo-hoo ![笑]
Whoo-hoo! [chuckles]

216
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:32,506
欢迎来到4000米以上的避难所!(回声)
Welcome to the asylum above 4,000 meters! [echoes]

217
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,947
你疯子,啊?
You nutter, huh?

218
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,916
值得出血吗?
Worth bleeding for?

219
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:39,546
那是海拔，伙计。(Michael笑)
[JP] That's the altitude, man. [Michael laughs]

220
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:40,844
出血的价值。
Worth bleeding for.

221
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,681
是的。(普通员工)
Yeah. [grunts]

222
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,749
这只是个开始，伙计。
[Michael] This is only the beginning, mate.

223
00:14:50,955 --> 00:14:53,032
来吧。我们要错过最后一趟电梯了。
Come on. We're gonna miss the last lift.

224
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:54,792
啊，我们会成功的!
Ah, we'll make it!

225
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,200
是的,你可能。
Yeah, you might.

226
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:57,861
他看起来油炸。
He looks fried.

227
00:14:57,896 --> 00:14:59,929
[迈克尔]嗯，我成功登顶了，不是吗?
[Michael] Well, I made it to the top, didn't I?

228
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:02,503
是啊，而且在这个过程中你被打得屁滚尿流。
Yeah, and it beat the crap out of you in the process.

229
00:15:02,538 --> 00:15:04,274
登特是一次训练攀登。
The Dent's a training climb.

230
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:07,508
不需要什么技能，只需要粗绳子。
There's no skills required, just big fat ropes.

231
00:15:07,543 --> 00:15:10,379
你在上面的时候拉屎了吗，迈克尔?你需要换尿布吗?
Did you shit yourself while you were up there, Michael? You need a fresh diaper?

232
00:15:10,414 --> 00:15:13,580
不，我已经去了。我给你留一个在马特洪峰喝。
No, I already went. I'll save you one for the Matterhorn.

233
00:15:13,615 --> 00:15:17,056
我很喜欢测量老二的比赛。我把我的拿出来。
I love a good dick-measuring contest. I'll just get mine out.

234
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:18,948
啊,请不要。[JP笑)
Ugh, please don't. [JP laughs]

235
00:15:18,983 --> 00:15:21,687
现在你可以把你的裤子放回去了，里奥，好吗?
And you can put yours back in your pants for now, Leo, okay?

236
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:22,963
(狮子座)好的,好的。
[Leo] Okay, okay.

237
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,923
嘿，别担心他。
Hey, don't worry about him.

238
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,861
当地人需要一段时间来热身。这是所有。
The locals take a while to warm up. That's all.

239
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,731
他和我一样是本地人。
He's about as local as I am.

240
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,469
他不是法国人。
Well, he's not French.

241
00:15:34,504 --> 00:15:36,240
但这是夏蒙尼。
But this is Chamonix.

242
00:15:36,275 --> 00:15:39,144
唯一的方法就是投入时间。
The only way to be one is to put in the time.

243
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:40,211
他应得的。
He's earned it.

244
00:15:48,683 --> 00:15:50,947
哦,对了。谢谢你,劳拉。
Oh, right. Thank you, Laura.

245
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,588
(聊天)
[chattering]

246
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,920
(说法语)

247
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,662
嗯。
Mmm.

248
00:16:03,665 --> 00:16:04,532
(笑)
[laughs]

249
00:16:13,576 --> 00:16:14,905
(都笑了)
[both laughing]

250
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,247
啊,男人。
Ah, man.

251
00:16:16,282 --> 00:16:17,875
是谁呢?
Who was that?

252
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,515
毫米。客户端。
Mm. A client.

253
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,947
就像，就因为我被他的一个笑话逗笑了，
Like, just because I laugh at one of his jokes,

254
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:26,015
他认为这是一个开始。
he thinks it's a come on.

255
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,127
我会的。我知道你会的，
I would. I know you would,

256
00:16:28,162 --> 00:16:29,194
你只小猪。
you little pig.

257
00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:31,493
(笑)哦，嚯嚯!好的。
[laughs] Oh, ho ho! Okay.

258
00:16:31,528 --> 00:16:33,231
< / i > <我>你好,迈克尔。<我>你好。< / i >
<i>Salut,</i> Michael. <i>Salut.</i>

00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,534
<我>谢谢。< / i >

00:16:40,372 --> 00:16:42,207
<我>桑特。< / i > <我>桑特。桑特。< / i >
<i>Santé.</i> <i>Santé. Santé.</i>

262
00:16:49,381 --> 00:16:51,084
那么，我们明天做什么?
So, what are we doing tomorrow?

263
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:52,580
我明天工作。
I'm working tomorrow.

264
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:54,813
狮子座的指导。嗯…哦。
Leo's guiding. Uh... Oh.

265
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,221
你呢，伊萨?
What about you, Isa?

266
00:16:56,784 --> 00:16:58,014
什么?
What?

267
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:00,258
我什么都不做。为什么?(笑)
I'm doing nothing. Why? [laughs]

268
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:03,459
不如你带迈克尔去滑雪吧?
Why don't you take Michael skiing, hmm?

269
00:17:03,494 --> 00:17:05,824
他应该一有机会就钻到冰川里。
He should get into the glacier every chance he gets.

270
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,332
我得让他适应马特洪峰的气候。
I need him acclimatized for the Matterhorn.

271
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:12,369
你滑雪滑得好吗?你不用照顾我之类的。
Do you ski well? Well, you're not gonna have to babysit me or anything.

272
00:17:12,404 --> 00:17:14,536
我不会的。跟上。
I won't. Keep up.

273
00:17:16,672 --> 00:17:18,936
哦……[笑][伊莎贝尔笑)
Ooh... [laughs] [Isabelle laughs]

274
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:16,301
好的。
Okay.

275
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,605
好吧,是的。
Okay, yes.

276
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:28,005
(电机转动)

277
00:18:34,552 --> 00:18:37,080

278
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:38,983
(叹息)
[sighs]

279
00:18:39,524 --> 00:18:41,425
你好。
Hello.

280
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,954
那是超级8号吗?
Mm. Is that a Super 8?

281
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:43,988
是的。
Yeah.

282
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:45,858
70年代后期模型。
Late '70s model.

283
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:47,893
[伊莎贝尔]我就是喜欢这些照片。
[Isabelle] I just love the images.

284
00:18:47,928 --> 00:18:49,499
柔软的和不完美的。
Soft and imperfect.

285
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,337
与数字没有什么浪漫。
There is no romance with digital.

286
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,208
你想试试吗?确定。
You want to have a try? Sure.

287
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,474
你只要扣动扳机就行了
You just have to squeeze the trigger there

288
00:18:57,509 --> 00:18:59,069
你滚。好的。
and you're rolling. Okay.

289
00:19:01,777 --> 00:19:03,139
(电机转动)你好!
[motor whirring] Hello!

290
00:19:03,174 --> 00:19:04,712
我吗?是的,你。
Me? Yes, you.

291
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,516
我的相机害羞。
I'm camera shy.

292
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:07,781
我不知道该怎么办。
I don't know what to do.

293
00:19:07,816 --> 00:19:09,046
[迈克尔]哦，你现在是吗?
[Michael] Oh, are you now?

294
00:19:10,522 --> 00:19:11,818
我是。
I am.

295
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:14,260
毫米。(笑)
Mm. [laughs]

296
00:19:16,528 --> 00:19:18,759
你和让·皮埃尔是怎么回事?
So, what's the deal with you and Jean Pierre?

297
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,333
你是不是…
Are you like, uh...

298
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,799
像什么?你知道，约会或者……
Like? You know, dating or...

299
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:27,999
(笑)
[laughs]

300
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,804
我们是好朋友。
Well, we're good friends.

301
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:33,136
他现在就像我的兄弟一样。
He's like a brother to me now, you know.

302
00:19:35,415 --> 00:19:37,206
你说现在是什么意思?(笑)
What do you mean now? [laughs]

303
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:39,208
你有这么多问题!
You have so many questions!

304
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:40,550
我——呃——
I-- Uh--

305

是啊，我们一直在约会。
Well, yeah, we've been dating.

大概两三年前吧。
Like two or three years ago.

307
00:19:45,986 --> 00:19:48,954
事实上，他是我的初恋。
And, actually, he was my first love.

308
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:50,230
正确的。
Right.

309
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,056
为什么?
Why?

310
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,563
你吃醋了吗，迈克尔?
Are you jealous, Michael?

311
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,269
当然不是。
Course not.

312
00:19:58,262 --> 00:19:59,338
骗子。
Liar.

(呼气)脸挺松的。
[exhales] The face is pretty loose.

323
00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:32,893
是的。它将解决。
Yeah. It will settle.

324
00:21:32,928 --> 00:21:34,862
沿着这条路还有很多好冰。
Plenty of good ice further up the route.

325
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,476
[迈克尔吹口哨]他跑得很快!
[Michael whistles] He's fast!

326
00:21:45,677 --> 00:21:47,105
肯定比我们强。
Definitely better than us.

327
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,272

(说法语)
[speaking French]

329
00:21:55,852 --> 00:21:57,115
Whoo-hoo-hoo !
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

330
00:22:00,384 --> 00:22:03,352
那是达米恩·鲁。这家伙是这里的电影明星。
Man, that's Damien Roux. The guy's a movie star here.

331
00:22:03,387 --> 00:22:04,661
是啊，他很疯狂。
Yeah, he's pretty insane.

332
00:22:04,696 --> 00:22:06,498
天啊，快看!
Oh, man, look at that!

333
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,566
这是攀岩。好吧。
That's climbing. All right.

334
00:22:10,064 --> 00:22:11,261
我来接下一球。
I'll take the next pitch.

335
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,900
你确定吗?是啊!
You sure? Yeah!

336
00:22:12,935 --> 00:22:14,803
好的。但是不要逗留。
All right. But don't hang about.

337
00:22:14,838 --> 00:22:17,674
我要在日落之前到达山顶，好吗?
I wanna be on the summit long before sunset, okay?

338

唉,
Agh!

是的，我们成功了，伙计!
[JP] Yeah, we made it, man!

343
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,018
[JP笑)是的。
[JP laughs] Yep.

344
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,384
(叹息)
[sighs]

345
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:10,188

[breathing heavily]

351
00:23:28,813 --> 00:23:31,077
露西会喜欢的。
Lucy would love this.

352
00:23:31,112 --> 00:23:32,650
可能是你姐姐引起的
Your sister could have led that

353
00:23:32,685 --> 00:23:34,751
一只手被绑在背后，伙计。
with one hand tied behind her back, man.

354
00:23:34,786 --> 00:23:36,115
是的。
Yeah.

355
00:23:37,723 --> 00:23:40,119
这本该是她的山。
This should have been her mountain.

356
00:23:40,154 --> 00:23:42,451
不然你以为我为什么寄明信片?
Why do you think I sent the postcard, eh?

357
00:23:42,486 --> 00:23:43,386
(笑)
[laughs]

358
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,530
哦,好的。
Oh, okay.

359
00:23:49,603 --> 00:23:51,504
我很遗憾她没能来这里。
I'm gutted she never made it out here.

360
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,836
但是你做到了。
But you did.

361
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:55,475
这很重要。
That counts for something.

362
00:23:56,973 --> 00:23:58,005
是的。
Yeah.

363
00:23:58,942 --> 00:23:59,974
是的。
Yep.

364
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:03,978
你想拍张照吗?
You want a picture?

365
00:24:04,618 --> 00:24:06,046
不。
No.

366
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:07,487
这是足够的。
This is enough.

367
00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:09,588
地狱是啊。
Hell yeah.

368
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:24,163
里奥估计艾格尔号的天气要变坏了。
[JP] Leo reckons the weather's breaking for the Eiger.

369
00:24:24,198 --> 00:24:27,001
再过几天就有机会了，伙计。
There's gonna be a window in the next couple of days, man.

370
00:24:27,036 --> 00:24:28,904
(迈克尔)不开始。你爬
[Michael] Don't start. You just climbed

371
00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:30,367
马特洪峰的北面
the north face of the Matterhorn.

372
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,138
你可以做到的。(手闸点击)
You can do this. [handbrake clicks]

373
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,174
我很诱惑。
I'm so tempted.

374
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:37,242
至少再待一天。
Stay one more day at least.

375
00:24:37,277 --> 00:24:39,717
我们明天要去意大利的黑谷。
You know, we're heading to the Valley Noir in Italy tomorrow.

376
00:24:39,752 --> 00:24:42,016
是的。这是我们的传统
Yeah. It's kind of a tradition we have

377
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:43,688
为了纪念夏至。
to mark the summer solstice.

378
00:24:43,723 --> 00:24:45,591
我知道。你已经说过了。
I know. You've said.

379
00:24:45,626 --> 00:24:47,824
这是在冰川上滑雪的最后机会了。
And it's the last chance to ski the glacier.

380
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:49,595
我在冰川上滑过雪。
I've skied the glacier.

381
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,696
不是这样的，朋友。不是这样的。
Not like this, my friend. Not like this.

382
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:57,493
我很想去，但我得走了。
Look, I'd love to, but I've gotta go.

383
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:04,742
我不能错过那趟渡船。
I can't miss that ferry.

384
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:06,546
是的。
Yeah.

385
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:09,846
我想她喜欢你。
She likes you I think.

386
00:25:09,881 --> 00:25:12,211
谁?你知道是谁。
Who? You know who.

387
00:25:12,246 --> 00:25:15,115
我们去滑雪了，让·皮埃尔，就这样。
We went skiing, Jean Pierre, that's all.

388
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,381
夏蒙尼喜欢说长道短，朋友。我们去滑雪!
Chamonix gossips, my friend. We went skiing!

389
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,350
夏蒙尼八卦!(笑)我们去滑雪了!
Chamonix gossips! [laughs] We went skiing!

哦，下面好热啊。
[Leo ] Ooh, it's baking down here now.

392
00:25:27,228 --> 00:25:29,701
是的。必须在80/85。
Yeah. Must be 80/85.

393
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,901
别再用华氏温度说话了。没有人能理解!
Gotta stop talking in Fahrenheit. No one understands!

394
00:25:31,936 --> 00:25:33,804
好的，先生。(笑)
Yes, please, sir. [laughing]

395
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,003
和脚。
And feet.

396
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:36,400
你为什么要用脚，兄弟?
Why do you use feet, bro?

397
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:37,709
是的。我不明白。
Yep. I don't get it.

398
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,238
米和摄氏度，亲爱的。
Meters and Celsius, honey.

399
00:25:39,273 --> 00:25:41,042
好了，真他妈热，伙计。(JP)更好。
Okay, it's fucking hot, man. [JP] Better.

400
00:25:41,077 --> 00:25:42,615
但高空仍然很凉爽。
But it's still cool up high.

(JP)嗨,米奇!他在那儿!
[JP] Hey, Mikey! There he is!

404
00:25:49,657 --> 00:25:50,887

[Michael] You good? [Rudi]<i> Ca va?</i>

405
00:25:50,922 --> 00:25:51,789
啊哈!
Aha!

406
00:25:53,892 --> 00:25:55,089
你的工作呢?
What about your job?

407
00:25:55,124 --> 00:25:56,255
啊，我会被解雇的。
Ah, I'll get fired.

408
00:25:56,895 --> 00:25:58,191
你父亲呢?
What about your father?

409
00:25:58,226 --> 00:26:00,556
他让我追随自己的梦想。
Well, he told me to follow my dreams.

410
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:02,294
他真的这么说了?
Whoa, he actually said that?

411
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:04,230
没有，他叫我婊子然后挂了电话。
No, he called me a cunt and hung up.

412
00:26:04,265 --> 00:26:08,498
啊。(笑)。生活还没结束呢，朋友。
Ah. [laughs]. Well, life's not over yet my friend.

413
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,599
你冲浪。嗯?
You're surfing. Hm?

414
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:11,743
哟!
Yo!

415
00:26:13,813 --> 00:26:15,142
你上来吗?
You coming up?

416
00:26:15,177 --> 00:26:16,748
啊，没有，我没带滑雪板。
Ah, no, I didn't bring any skis.

417
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,013
我只是过来打个招呼。
I just came to say hi.

418
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:19,443
没办法,男人。
No way, man.

419
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:21,445
你不会错过这趟车的。[笑]
You can't miss this ride. [laughing]

420
00:26:22,756 --> 00:26:24,954
你带了一双备用的?(笑)
You brought a spare pair? [laughs]

421
00:26:24,989 --> 00:26:27,418
谢谢你,小伙子。你还没看到我们在滑什么呢。
Thanks, man. You haven't seen what we're skiing yet.

422
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:28,925
完全正确![笑]
Exactly! [laughing]

[伊莎贝尔]来吧，迈克尔!
[Isabelle] Come on, Michael!

433
00:27:12,102 --> 00:27:13,101
哦,狗屎!
Oh, shit!

434
00:27:15,336 --> 00:27:16,599
狗屎!
Shit!

435
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:19,877
哦,狗屎!
Oh, shit!

436
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:31,482
(喘着粗气)
[breathing heavily]

437
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:33,154
哦,他妈的。
Oh, fuck.

438
00:28:01,382 --> 00:28:02,414
(狮子座)迈克尔!
[Leo] Michael!

439
00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:07,859
你在冰隧道里左转了吗?
You made a left through the ice tunnel?

440
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,224
伊莎贝尔告诉我。真他妈疯了，伙计!
Isabelle told me. That's fucking nuts, man!

441
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:12,358
是的，那是一个错误的转弯。不,不,不。
Yeah, it was a wrong turn. No, no, no.

442
00:28:12,393 --> 00:28:16,032
如果你没走出去，那只是一个错误的转弯，对吧?
It's only a wrong turn if you don't make it out, right?

443
00:28:17,035 --> 00:28:18,661
你听说了吗?
Did you hear about this?

444
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,905
他滑雪的样子就像罗杰·摩尔一样。
He was skiing like he was Roger Moore or some shit.

445
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,007
[笑]听说他在上面全速前进<i>View to a Kill</i>。
[laughs] Heard he went full-on <i>View to a Kill</i> up there.

446
00:28:24,042 --> 00:28:27,340
他就像我们自己人一样。啊,狮子座。
Almost like he's one of our own. Aw, Leo.

抱歉，我，我喝了几瓶啤酒。(笑)
I'm sorry, I've, uh, I've had a few beers. [laughs]

你还真会让女生觉得自己很特别。
Wow, you really know how to make a girl feel special.

472
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,810
不,来吧。我不是这个意思。
No, come on. That's not what I meant.

473

你知道我的意思。你是什么意思?
You know what I meant. So what did you mean?

474

你看起来很漂亮。

00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:53,591
除了我漂亮，你还有别的吗?

(笑)
[laughs]

478
00:29:54,858 --> 00:29:56,231
有点糟糕。好的。
It's a bit lousy. Okay.

今天和你一起滑雪真的很特别。
It was really special skiing with you today.

因为我想爬上去帮JP实现他的梦想
Well, 'cause I wanted to climb and help JP realize his dream.

490
00:30:34,634 --> 00:30:36,876
这就是你留下来的唯一原因吗?

491
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,241
这不是唯一的原因。

你真要逼我说出来吗?
Are you really gonna make me say it?

494
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,643
是的。(笑)
Yeah. [laughs]

495

It's a boring job but pays enough to get up to the glacier.

天啊，她性感了好一阵子。

Folks round Interlaken reckon the Eiger's gonna play ball.

599
00:38:55,068 --> 00:38:56,870
是吗?她的条件吗?
Yeah? She's in condition?

600
00:38:56,905 --> 00:38:58,872
跟你现在的表现差不多了。
About as good as you're gonna get right now.

601
00:38:58,907 --> 00:39:01,644
如果你想要完美，等到11月。
If you want it perfect, wait till November.

602
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:02,711
让我们这样做!
Let's do this!

603
00:39:04,044 --> 00:39:04,911
迈克尔?
Michael?

604
00:39:06,145 --> 00:39:08,046
我们在马特洪峰花了16个小时。
We took 16 hours on the Matterhorn.

605
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:11,181
十分钟就能搞定。艾格尔是它的两倍大。
We could have done it in ten. The Eiger's twice the size.

606
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:14,052
你听到他刚才说的了。我们可能没机会了。
You heard what he just said. We might not get another chance.

607
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:17,561
这种风险可能会让你失望，而不是死亡，JP。
That's a risk that could end in disappointment, not-- not death, JP.

608
00:39:18,421 --> 00:39:20,388
(叹息)
[sighs]

609
00:39:20,423 --> 00:39:22,060
这和艾格尔无关。
This is not about the Eiger.

610
00:39:22,095 --> 00:39:24,194
是关于达米恩·鲁的。
It's about Damien Roux.

611
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:26,196
你知道他为什么死吗，迈克尔?
You know why he's dead, Michael?

612
00:39:27,067 --> 00:39:28,297
因为自由攀登者
'Cause free solo climbers

613
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:29,903
不要活到老。
don't live to a ripe old age.

614
00:39:29,938 --> 00:39:32,840
这是冷酷无情的生活事实。
That's just a cold, hard fact of life.

615
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:34,710
没有绳子，就没有搭档。
No ropes, no partner.

616
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,042
只是时间问题。
Just a matter of time.

617
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:42,487
我吗?我想回到传统的登山运动中去。
Me? I'd like to get back to some good, old-fashioned mountaineering.

618
00:39:42,522 --> 00:39:44,720
把昨天抛在脑后。谢谢你！
Put yesterday behind us. Thank you.

619
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:47,690
【狮子座】哟。
[Leo] Yo.

620
00:39:49,727 --> 00:39:51,694
这就是他和我们的区别。
That's what separates him and us.

621
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:55,423
而我将是那根绳子的末端，
And I'll be at the end of that rope,

622
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:57,359
一如既往地照顾你。
babysitting you as always.

623
00:39:57,394 --> 00:39:59,196
记住，迈克尔
And just remember, Michael,

624
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:01,737
是或不是才是正确答案。
yes or no is the right answer.

625
00:40:01,772 --> 00:40:04,201
我不会和你一起爬山的。
I won't climb with you on a maybe.

626
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:06,940
你做决定，我们都支持你。
You make your decision, we'll back you either way.

627
00:40:06,975 --> 00:40:09,305
(鸟唱歌)
[birds singing]

628
00:40:17,788 --> 00:40:19,084
嗨,迈克尔。
Hey, Michael.

629
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:22,692
你好。嘿。
Hello. Hey.

630
00:40:22,727 --> 00:40:24,419
这里的情况还不错。
It's not so bad here.

631
00:40:24,454 --> 00:40:26,256
不，夏蒙尼最好的酒店。
No, best hotel in Chamonix.

632
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:29,633
[笑]你们的客房服务怎么样?
[laughs] And how is your room service?

633
00:40:31,065 --> 00:40:32,328
你正看着它。
You're looking at it.

634
00:40:32,935 --> 00:40:34,506
嗯，来杯茶?
Mm, cup of tea?

635
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:36,838
(笑)不不不，我不喝茶。
[laughs] No, no, no, I don't drink tea.

636
00:40:38,138 --> 00:40:40,138
我不是你的英国姑娘，迈克尔。
I'm not one of your English girls, Michael.

637
00:40:40,173 --> 00:40:41,304
(笑)好。
[laughs] Okay.

638
00:40:42,076 --> 00:40:43,240
(讲法语)
[speaks French]

639
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:45,341
在背包里。
Mm. In the backpack.

640
00:40:47,477 --> 00:40:51,149
(笑)真正的美食。
[laughs] The real gourmet stuff.

641
00:40:51,184 --> 00:40:54,152
但我发现了一些有趣的事情。
But I see something interesting.

642
00:40:55,188 --> 00:40:57,826
Mm-hmm-hmm。让我们看一看。
Mm-hmm-hmm. Let's have a look.

643
00:40:57,861 --> 00:40:59,190
(Michael笑)
[Michael chuckles]

644
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,698
[笑]<我>哦,莆田市。< / i >
[laughing] <i>Oh, putain.</i>

645
00:41:01,733 --> 00:41:04,327
这是一个坚强的样子。
That's a strong look.

646
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:06,901
(笑)我那时很年轻。
[laughs] I was young.

647
00:41:07,937 --> 00:41:09,970
哦,这是谁?
Oh, who's this?

648
00:41:10,005 --> 00:41:11,972
她很漂亮。
She's very pretty.

649
00:41:12,975 --> 00:41:14,304
我应该嫉妒吗?
Should I be jealous?

650
00:41:15,648 --> 00:41:17,681
那是露西，我的妹妹。
That's Lucy, my sister.

651
00:41:18,178 --> 00:41:19,210
嗯。
Mmm.

652
00:41:22,116 --> 00:41:24,215
你们确实长得有点像。
You do look a bit alike.

653
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,349
同样又大又亮的眼睛。
Same big, bright eyes.

654
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,158
我说错什么了吗?
Did I say something wrong?

655
00:41:34,964 --> 00:41:35,996
[笑]
[chuckles]

656
00:41:36,669 --> 00:41:38,801
哦,什么都没有。
Uh, nothing.

657
00:41:41,564 --> 00:41:42,937
她已经离开我们了。
She's not with us anymore.

658
00:41:44,941 --> 00:41:47,271
好的。我很抱歉。
Okay. I'm so sorry.

659
00:41:47,306 --> 00:41:49,944
如果你愿意，我们可以聊点别的。
If you want, we can talk about something else.

660
00:41:49,979 --> 00:41:51,143
没关系。
It's okay.

661
00:41:51,915 --> 00:41:53,343
呃，我不介意。
Uh, I don't mind.

662
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:55,048
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

663
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:58,150
通常，我都无法忍受谈论她。
Usually, uh, I can't stand talking about her.

664
00:41:58,185 --> 00:42:00,251
我一想到她就…
I can barely even think about her without...

665
00:42:04,829 --> 00:42:07,929
但在这里，一切都很奇怪。
But out here, it's strange.

666
00:42:09,933 --> 00:42:11,867
就好像她和我们在一起。
It's like she's with us.

667
00:42:11,902 --> 00:42:14,298
我知道这听起来很傻。不,它不是。
I know it sounds silly. No, it's not.

668
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:16,531
所以，她也是个攀岩者?是的。
So, she was a climber too? Yeah.

669
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,467
一个好一个。
A good one.

670
00:42:23,606 --> 00:42:25,078
我妈妈去世的时候，
When my mum died,

671
00:42:25,883 --> 00:42:27,344
我的爸爸…
my dad...

672
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:29,577
有点太过分了。
kinda went off the deep end.

673
00:42:29,612 --> 00:42:33,592
和他在一起很可怕。
He was pretty horrible to be around.

674
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:36,056
仍然是。
Still is.

675
00:42:37,026 --> 00:42:39,521
她的解决办法是带我们去爬山。
Her solution was to take us climbing.

676
00:42:39,556 --> 00:42:41,325
她让你上瘾了。
So, she got you hooked.

677
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,700
她做到了。
She did.

678
00:42:43,736 --> 00:42:45,065
当你攀爬,
When you climb,

679
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:47,397
这就像……
it's like...

680
00:42:48,598 --> 00:42:50,367
没有其他的出口。
nothing else exits.

681
00:42:51,942 --> 00:42:55,878
你知道，这里没有废话，悲伤，痛苦的空间。
You know, there's no room for bullshit, grief, pain.

682
00:42:55,913 --> 00:42:57,506
只有现在。
Only the present.

683
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:58,914
下一步的行动。
The next move.

684
00:43:00,643 --> 00:43:02,885
她后来怎么样了?
And what happened to her?

685
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,891
我们在苏格兰登山，突然天气变了。
We were on a climb in Scotland, and the weather turned.

686
00:43:08,926 --> 00:43:10,794
总变白。
Total whiteout.

687
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:12,664
这，这，这太可怕了。
It-- It was-- It was scary.

688
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,458
当我们回到停车场时，
When we got back to the car park,

689
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:19,968
回来后我们喝得酩酊大醉，还喝了几杯啤酒。
we were so buzzed that we'd made it back that we had a couple of beers.

690
00:43:20,003 --> 00:43:21,167
几。
Just a couple.

691
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,532
别那么紧张，你知道的。
Take the edge off, you know.

692
00:43:24,777 --> 00:43:26,777
她急着回家。
She was in such a rush to get home.

693
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:28,977
她想开车。
She wanted to drive.

694
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:33,575
我刚刚…的感觉。
I just had this... feeling.

695
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:36,149
好像要发生什么坏事似的。
Like something bad was gonna happen.

696
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:42,452
我什么也没做。
And I did nothing.

697
00:44:14,794 --> 00:44:17,157
(声)
[rumbling]

698
00:44:22,901 --> 00:44:25,132
迈克尔,趴下!
Michael, get down!

699
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:30,874
啊,操!
Ah, fuck!

700
00:44:34,814 --> 00:44:36,209
(声)
[rumbling]

701
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:42,446
他妈的。
Fuck.

702
00:44:44,923 --> 00:44:46,582
(隆隆继续)
[rumbling continues]

703
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,618
迈克尔!你对吧?
Michael! You all right?

704
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,356
是的。(喘气)
Yeah. [panting]

705
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,745
(大声冰裂纹)
[ice cracking loudly]

706
00:45:08,276 --> 00:45:10,012
嘿，嘿，上车!
Hey, hey, get in!

707
00:45:10,047 --> 00:45:11,673
(的)
[grunting]

708
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:29,801
(普通员工)
[grunts]

709
00:45:31,068 --> 00:45:33,266
哇。(呼出)
Whoa. [exhales]

710
00:45:33,301 --> 00:45:35,235
他的脸都要碎了。
The face is falling to fucking bits.

711
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:38,733
阳光温暖了脸，融化了冰。
The sun is warming up the face, melting the ice.

712
00:45:38,768 --> 00:45:41,109
所有压实的岩石都松动了。
All that compacted rock's come loose.

713
00:45:41,144 --> 00:45:44,343
我们现在必须停止攀登。燕子窝的Bivvy。
We need to stop climbing now. Bivvy at the Swallow's Nest.

714
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:47,412
[迈克尔]明天看看怎么样。
[Michael] See how it is tomorrow.

715
00:45:47,447 --> 00:45:50,481
(风咆哮)
[wind howling]

716
00:45:57,556 --> 00:46:00,392
[娜塔莎]哦，我的天哪。好了，你可以的。
[Natascha] Oh, my God. All right now, you got this.

717
00:46:00,427 --> 00:46:01,492
快来找我。
Just get to me.

718
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:04,396
好了，亲爱的，我就在这。
All right, honey, I'm right here.

719
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:06,134
我就在这里。(Natascha普通员工)
I'm right here. [Natascha grunts]

720
00:46:06,169 --> 00:46:07,729
好的。越快越好。
Okay. Quick as you can.

721
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:09,071
(声)
[rumbling]

722
00:46:09,106 --> 00:46:11,106
(大喊)(Leo)嘿!
[shouts] [Leo] Hey!

723
00:46:11,141 --> 00:46:12,910
嗨,亲爱的…(普通员工)
Hey, honey... [grunts]

724
00:46:14,144 --> 00:46:16,276
好吧，来找我。
All  right, get to me.

725
00:46:16,311 --> 00:46:18,278
[Natascha嘟哝)
[Natascha grunting]

726
00:46:18,313 --> 00:46:20,775
我抓住你了!对了,恢复!
[Leo grunts] I got you! Right, recover!

727
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:22,348
(Natascha咕哝,喘息声)
[Natascha grunts, gasps]

728
00:46:23,516 --> 00:46:24,746
(叹息)
[groans]

729
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:27,353
给我一马!(普通员工)
Gimme some slack! [grunts]

730
00:46:29,852 --> 00:46:30,994
来吧。好的。
Come on. Okay.

731
00:46:31,029 --> 00:46:32,061
好吧。
All right.

732
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:35,790
(低声呻吟)
[whimpers]

733
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:37,935
哦,我的上帝!这是接近。
Oh, my God! That was close.

734
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:39,266
对不起，我吓坏了。
I'm sorry for freaking out.

735
00:46:39,835 --> 00:46:41,873
不不，这太疯狂了。还是来了。
No, no, it's crazy. It's still coming.

736
00:46:43,305 --> 00:46:46,339
(风吹口哨)
[wind whistling]

737
00:47:00,157 --> 00:47:01,860
[里奥对着收音机]<i>JP，迈克尔，请回答。</i>
[Leo on radio] <i>JP, Michael, come in.</i>

738
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:04,027
[无线电哔哔声]是的，里奥。
[radio bleeps] Yep, Leo.

739
00:47:04,062 --> 00:47:06,458
你们俩好吗?<i>我们在死亡馆</i>
How are you two doing? <i>We're at Death Bivvy,</i>

740
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:08,493
准备睡觉了。你吗?
about to turn in for the night. You?

741
00:47:08,528 --> 00:47:10,363
我们在燕窝。
We're at Swallow's Nest.

742
00:47:10,398 --> 00:47:12,629
本来可以走得更远，但这里有很多岩崩，
Could've gotten further, but there's a lot of rockfall,

743
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:14,697
我们现在没必要逼他。
and we don't need to push it right now.

744
00:47:14,732 --> 00:47:16,534
是啊，越往上越糟。
Yeah, it gets worse higher up.

745
00:47:16,569 --> 00:47:18,602
太热了，冰也不够。
It's too warm, there's not enough ice.

746
00:47:18,637 --> 00:47:20,307
<i>这是他妈的波涛汹涌。</i>
<i>It's choppy as fuck.</i>

747
00:47:20,342 --> 00:47:22,606
是啊，但如果我们行动得够早应该没问题。
Yeah, but should be fine if we get moving early enough.

748

00:57:31,117 --> 00:57:32,347
五分钟。
Five minutes.

903
00:57:33,317 --> 00:57:34,690

[sighs]

904
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:47,197
(迈克尔的)
[Michael grunting]

905
00:57:48,068 --> 00:57:50,805

906
00:58:00,718 --> 00:58:01,882
(咕哝,呼出)
[grunts, exhales]

907
00:58:13,225 --> 00:58:14,455
嘿，发生什么事了?
Hey, what's going on?

908
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:16,325
把我放下来，伙计。
Low-Lower me down, man.

909
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,768
为什么?低我失望!
Why? Lower me down!

910
00:58:23,169 --> 00:58:24,938
上面到底发生了什么事?
[JP] What the fuck happened up there?

911
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:31,043
听着，我今天没心情向任何人致敬。
Look, I'm not in the mood for honoring anyone today.

912
00:58:33,212 --> 00:58:34,717
嘿，怎么了?
[JP] Hey, what's the matter?

913
00:58:34,752 --> 00:58:35,982
[迈克尔]怎么了?
[Michael] What's the matter?

914
00:58:36,017 --> 00:58:38,182
这地方太疯狂了。
This place is insane.

915
00:58:38,217 --> 00:58:40,382
人们像苍蝇一样掉下来。
People are dropping like flies.

916
00:58:40,417 --> 00:58:43,594
是啊，明年夏天，也会一样的，伙计。
Yeah, well, next summer, it will be the same, man.

917
00:58:43,629 --> 00:58:46,553
里奥和娜塔莎虽然死了，但他们是为自己热爱的事业而死，
Leo and Natascha may have died, but they died doing what they loved,

918
00:58:46,588 --> 00:58:48,863
做他们活着的目的。做自己喜欢的事?
doing what they lived for. Doing what they loved?

919
00:58:48,898 --> 00:58:50,733
你是认真的吗?
Are you serious?

920
00:58:50,768 --> 00:58:53,395
他们尖叫着死去，让·皮埃尔。
They died screaming, Jean Pierre.

921
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:55,166
你还不明白吗?
Don't you get it?

922
00:58:55,201 --> 00:58:57,971
这就是我们回到这里的原因。
That's why we come back out here.

923
00:58:58,006 --> 00:59:01,172
当我们攀登时，它们就在我们身边。
When we climb, they're right here with us.

924
00:59:01,207 --> 00:59:03,647
他们活着。你没感觉到吗?
They're alive again. Don't you feel it?

925
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:08,377
别这样，你不能现在就放弃。
Come on, you-- you can't quit now.

926
00:59:08,412 --> 00:59:10,313
我们就差这么一点了。
Not when we're this close.

927
00:59:10,348 --> 00:59:11,688
艾格尔说不行。
The Eiger said no.

928
00:59:11,723 --> 00:59:14,251
好吧，我们得尊重这一点。
Fine, we have to respect that.

929
00:59:15,551 --> 00:59:17,661
所以我们继续去白山。
So we move on to the White Mountain.

930
00:59:21,557 --> 00:59:22,666
我害怕。
I'm afraid.

931
00:59:22,701 --> 00:59:24,327
我知道你很害怕。
I know you're afraid.

932
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:27,462
我也怕。
I'm afraid too.

933
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:31,136
但我们想要的一切都在恐惧的另一边。
But everything we ever wanted is on the other side of fear.

934
00:59:34,438 --> 00:59:36,680
你来不来我都要做，迈克尔。
I'm doing this with or without you, Michael.

935
00:59:36,715 --> 00:59:38,473
所以做个决定吧。
So make a decision.

936
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:42,147
我不会和什么山共享我的墓碑，JP。
I'm not sharing my headstone with some mountain, JP.

937
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:44,919
我做不到。
I can't do it.

938
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,400
<我> va吗?</i> [barman]<i> Comment allez-vous?< / i >
<i>Ca va?</i> [barman]<i> Comment allez-vous?</i>

940
01:00:06,008 --> 01:00:07,535
[酒保说法语]嗯哼。
[barman speaks French] Mm-hmm.

941
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:16,819
让·皮埃尔告诉我你现在出去了。
Jean Pierre told me that you're out now.

942
01:00:16,854 --> 01:00:19,921
是的,它是。完成了。
Yeah, it's over. Done.

943
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:29,161
我在想也许…我们可以开你的车。
I was thinking that maybe... we could take your car.

944
01:00:29,196 --> 01:00:30,998
快离开这里。
Just get away from here.

945
01:00:31,033 --> 01:00:33,770
让我们有机会独处，做我们自己。
Be our chance to be alone and be ourselves.

946
01:00:33,805 --> 01:00:34,837
<我>谢谢。< / i >
<i>Merci.</i>

947
01:00:35,807 --> 01:00:37,598
(叹息)九天,
[sighs] Nine days,

948
01:00:37,633 --> 01:00:40,337
我们只剩下这些了，我必须离开，你知道的。
that's all we have left, and I have to leave, you know.

949
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:42,108
我讨厌这一点。
I hate that.

950
01:00:43,408 --> 01:00:44,847
我们在一起,
We get together,

951
01:00:44,882 --> 01:00:47,476
然后生活就来了。
then life gets in the way.

952
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:50,248
它不需要。是的，但它总是这样。
It doesn't have to. Yeah, but it always does.

953
01:00:50,283 --> 01:00:51,678
不是吗?
Doesn't it?

954
01:00:51,713 --> 01:00:53,581
(嘲笑)圣诞节来临时,
[scoffs] Come Christmas,

955
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:55,825
我们会分道扬镳的
we would have gone our separate ways

956
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,795
你甚至不知道我长什么样
and you won't even know what the fuck I look like.

957

(叹息)
[sighs]

958
01:01:00,359 --> 01:01:02,392
这种自怨自艾的醉酒行为，
This self-pitying drunk act,

959
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:05,098
很无聊。
it's boring.

960
01:01:05,133 --> 01:01:07,265
是的。是的，它不适合你。
Yeah. Yeah, it doesn't suit you.

961
01:01:08,301 --> 01:01:09,498
你不是这样的人。
That's not who you are.

962
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:11,203
我不是这样的人?唔唔。
That's not who I am? Mm-mmm.

963
01:01:11,238 --> 01:01:13,502
我他妈才认识你七天。
I've known you for seven fucking days.

964
01:01:13,537 --> 01:01:15,306
你不，你不知道我是谁。
You don't-- You don't know who I am.

965
01:01:15,341 --> 01:01:18,045
我他妈都不知道我是谁?
I don't even know who I fucking am, okay?

966
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,112
享受。
Enjoy.

01:05:29,925 --> 01:05:31,463
勃朗峰。(嘲笑)
Mont Blanc. [scoffs]

1045
01:05:32,664 --> 01:05:34,730
但你说你不干了。
But you said you were finished.

1046
01:05:38,505 --> 01:05:41,143
我是他的登山伙伴，伊莎贝尔。你想要什么?
I'm his climbing partner, Isabelle. What do you want?

1047
01:05:43,279 --> 01:05:45,972
据我所知，你已经被替换了。
Well, from what I heard, you've been replaced.

1048
01:05:46,007 --> 01:05:47,875
Béa和鲁迪?嗯。
With Béa and Rudi? Mmm.

1049
01:05:48,845 --> 01:05:50,317
他们不够好。
They're not good enough.

1050
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,122
他脑子不清楚。
He's not thinking straight.

1051
01:05:55,951 --> 01:05:56,983
(叹息)
[sighs]

1052
01:05:57,018 --> 01:05:58,094
(叹息)
[sighs]

1053
01:06:01,198 --> 01:06:02,725
我不知道，只是…
I don't know, just...

1054
01:06:04,696 --> 01:06:06,498
也许你可以……
[exhales] Maybe you could...

1055
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:11,701
劝他别这么做，知道吗?
just talk him out of it, you know?

1056
01:06:12,473 --> 01:06:13,505
给我吗?
For me?

1057
01:06:16,609 --> 01:06:17,872
他不会听。
He won't listen.

1058
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,512
你知道的。
You know that.

1059
01:06:21,812 --> 01:06:24,450
他无论如何都要爬那座白色的山。
He's climbing that white mountain no matter what.

1060
01:06:27,015 --> 01:06:29,059
(迈克尔叹了口气)那是他的选择。
[Michael sighs] That's his choice.

1061
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:36,858
[迈克尔呻吟着]你知道他有强迫症，很固执。
[Michael groans] You know he's obsessional and unbending.

1062
01:06:41,865 --> 01:06:44,074
真不敢相信我这么笨。
I can't believe I'm so stupid.

1063
01:06:49,444 --> 01:06:50,806
再一次…
Once again...

1064
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:56,218
我们没人有机会对抗这个地方。
none of us stood a chance against this place.

1065
01:06:57,848 --> 01:06:58,880
(嘲讽的笑)
[wry laugh]

1066
01:07:01,192 --> 01:07:02,884
我欠他的。
I owe him.

1067
01:07:02,919 --> 01:07:04,061
为了什么?
For what?

1068
01:07:06,758 --> 01:07:09,132
在我最需要他的时候，他一直在我身边。
He was there for me when I needed him most.

1069
01:07:10,091 --> 01:07:12,025
好吧?他——他
Okay? He-- He--

1070
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:14,368
他带我爬山，让我很忙，
he took me climbing, he kept me busy,

1071
01:07:14,403 --> 01:07:16,106
他让我保持理智。
he kept me sane.

1072
01:07:17,703 --> 01:07:20,506
现在他要杀了你。
And now he's going to get you killed.

1073
01:07:24,446 --> 01:07:27,084
露西的死是因为我什么都没做。
Lucy died because I did nothing.

1074
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:34,322
我不会让这种事也发生在我最好的朋友身上。不。
I'm not gonna let that happen to my best friend, too. No.

1075
01:07:36,194 --> 01:07:39,393
[欢快的说唱音乐演奏]
[upbeat rap music plays]
