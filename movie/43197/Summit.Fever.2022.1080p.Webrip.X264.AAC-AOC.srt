1
00:01:56,181 --> 00:01:57,191
Doing good.

2
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,362
Yeah.

3
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,991
Keep going. Yeah.

4
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,532
Just on the left.

5
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:12,767
Left foot where your knee is.

6
00:02:21,382 --> 00:02:24,647
Ugh... Agh... Huh!

7
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:28,618
Fuck!

8
00:02:28,653 --> 00:02:30,554
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

9
00:02:31,755 --> 00:02:34,151
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

10
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:35,658
Slipped on the hold.

11
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:41,334
Cogs beat the shit out
of me, man.

12
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,502
Almost had it.
Yeah.

13
00:02:45,703 --> 00:02:47,197
Nice one.

14
00:02:47,232 --> 00:02:48,902
Ah, you made it look easy.

15
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,641
There's not a hundred people
in this country

16
00:02:51,676 --> 00:02:53,577
that could have made
that move, man.

17
00:02:53,612 --> 00:02:56,316
You're climbing two grades
better than last time.

18
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:57,383
Yeah.

19
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:02,487
Did I tell you I
got a few sponsors looking at me?

20
00:03:02,522 --> 00:03:03,719
Yeah?
Yeah.

21
00:03:03,754 --> 00:03:06,117
To climb out in Chamonix, man.

22
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:09,054
If I can make enough noise
this summer, they should bite.

23
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,495
Nice one, man.

24
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,332
Got a couple of interviews
lined up.

25
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:14,334
Planning on posting
some big routes.

26
00:03:14,369 --> 00:03:16,226
Yeah? Like what?

27
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:17,337
Like what?

28
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:19,097
Like Matterhorn,

29
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,439
Eiger

30
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:22,034
and the south face
of Mont Blanc.

31
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,102
Ah, the big three.

32
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,236
It's quite an ask.
Yep.

33
00:03:26,271 --> 00:03:28,480
Which is why I need
my climbing partner.

34
00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:31,747
Ah, I can't, man.
Even if I wanted to.

35
00:03:31,782 --> 00:03:34,178
The internship starts on
Monday. You know that.

36
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,587
Oh, yeah. Insurance, right?

37
00:03:36,622 --> 00:03:38,523
It's just temporary.

38
00:03:38,558 --> 00:03:40,525
It's gonna be temporary
for the next 50 years, man,

39
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,724
if you're not careful.

40
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,726
Come on. Term's over.

41
00:03:43,761 --> 00:03:46,091
This is our last
real summer holiday.

42
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,532
Ever.

43
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:49,435
You can worry about next year
next year.

44
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,701
What do you say?

45
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:53,571
Suit and tie...

46
00:03:53,606 --> 00:03:55,738
or ice ax and crampons?

47
00:04:03,814 --> 00:04:07,321
Twenty-two years on this planet,
you still can't tie a tie.

48
00:04:08,852 --> 00:04:11,050
Label's sticking out.
Smarten up.

49
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,756
You've got
a real opportunity here.

50
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:16,220
Fit in.

51
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:17,529
Keep up.

52
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,368
Ah, David.

53
00:04:21,403 --> 00:04:23,128
This is my son, Michael.

54
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,294
All right, son, how you doing?

55
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:26,703
Give him the tour, would you?

56
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:30,267
See that?

57
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:31,774
Six grands' worth of kettle.

58
00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:33,237
Shoes, another bag.

59
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:34,810
Whistle, three large.

60
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:37,142
See the Porsche outside?
That's mine, innit.

61
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:39,485
I'm walking round this place with a
hundred grand wrapped round me.

62
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,982
You know how I got it?
On the fucking phones.

63
00:04:43,084 --> 00:04:44,182
This is you.

64
00:04:47,429 --> 00:04:49,957
Now, pick up the phone
and dream big.

65
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:54,632
Carol, where's that latte?

66
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:04,972
I'd love to have
a minute of your time.

67
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,173
Hello.

68
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:12,848
How we doing, boy?
What we got?

69
00:05:12,883 --> 00:05:15,180
That should have been done
about 1:00. Yeah, but it's my first day.

70
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:16,786
Don't really care, buddy.
I know.

71
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:18,854
Don't really care.
Fake it till you make it.

72
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:20,922
<i>Any other cliché you want, mate.</i>

73
00:05:22,387 --> 00:05:24,090
<i>Hey, Mikey, Mikey!</i>

74
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,796
<i>Just want you to see
what you're missing out here.</i>

75
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:29,634
<i>Look at that!
Yee-hoo-hoo!</i>

76
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:34,837
Mm?

77
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:43,582
All right.

78
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:56,694
<i>High pressure moving in.</i>

79
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:58,993
<i>One mountain, one week.</i>

80
00:05:59,028 --> 00:06:02,194
<i>You'll be back in front of your
computer before you're even missed.</i>

81
00:07:00,892 --> 00:07:04,157
I do appreciate you
didn't break into your own house.

82
00:07:05,127 --> 00:07:06,896
Yeah, right, mate. Yeah, yeah.

83
00:08:35,184 --> 00:08:37,822
Aaah, Mikey! There he is!

84
00:08:37,857 --> 00:08:39,791
A postcard?

85
00:08:39,826 --> 00:08:42,519
Ah, man, what, you traveled
back in time to get this?

86
00:08:43,764 --> 00:08:46,897
1984. I knew
it would get your attention.

87
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:48,734
A text would have been fine.

88
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:50,230
You ignore my texts, man.

89
00:08:50,265 --> 00:08:52,870
All right, guys,
a couple of quick intros.

90
00:08:52,905 --> 00:08:56,401
Michael, say hi to Natascha.
Natascha, say hi to Michael.

91
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,073
Hey.
American?

92
00:08:58,779 --> 00:08:59,844
Canadian.
Yep.

93
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:04,882
But don't get any ideas.

94
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:07,115
'Cause this is Leo,
her boyfriend.

95
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,655
He's a climbing guide.

96
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,087
Alps, Andes,
wherever you wanna die, man.

97
00:09:12,122 --> 00:09:14,727
'Sup?
Not Canadian.

98
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:18,863
California. Make a lot more money
here than back home in the Sierra.

99
00:09:18,898 --> 00:09:20,766
Well, Mr. Moneybags...

100
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,099
And this is Rudi.
He's a snowboarder.

101
00:09:24,134 --> 00:09:25,771
He should turn pro
any day now, yeah?

102
00:09:25,806 --> 00:09:28,939
Yeah, and then I can kiss
my day job goodbye.

103
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:34,010
I need money, bro.
Gimme your watch, hmm?

104
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:40,313
Ah.
Uh-huh.

105
00:09:40,348 --> 00:09:41,754
A review on Tripadvisor

106
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,723
called me "a fucking prick".

107
00:09:43,758 --> 00:09:45,153
A review we can all trust.

108
00:09:45,188 --> 00:09:46,924
Ha, fuck you!

109
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,728
It was my proudest moment.
So what?

110
00:09:49,258 --> 00:09:50,730
Yeah.

111
00:09:50,765 --> 00:09:52,930
All right, brother,
how long have I got you?

112
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:55,460
Five days.
It's the best I could do, man.

113
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,462
Any longer and I'm out of a job.

114
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,068
All right, finish up,
girls and boys.

115
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:00,971
Let's go climbing.
'Bout time.

116
00:10:01,006 --> 00:10:02,368
Let's go!

117
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:04,777
Wait. What, what, what, now?
Yeah.

118
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,307
Man, I've just driven 500 miles.
I've hardly slept.

119
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:08,638
What are you, like, 40?

120
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:10,915
We need to get you
acclimatized, man!

121
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,577
Come on.
This is it, Mikey!

122
00:10:14,382 --> 00:10:15,953
Grab your kit, man.

123
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:18,087
We take the telecabin
in 20 minutes, all right?

124
00:10:18,122 --> 00:10:19,957
Uh...
Ha ha!

125
00:10:19,992 --> 00:10:22,091
You're in Chamonix, baby!

126
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,357
Climbed anything of note
out here, Michael?

127
00:10:24,392 --> 00:10:26,128
It's my first time in the Alps.

128
00:10:26,163 --> 00:10:29,296
Fledgling, huh?
Guess you must like babysitting.

129
00:10:29,331 --> 00:10:31,397
Ah, Michael can handle himself.

130
00:10:31,432 --> 00:10:33,839
He put up a new route
on the Orion Face.

131
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:35,940
Orion Face?
Never heard of it.

132
00:10:35,975 --> 00:10:37,172
It's on Ben Nevis.

133
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:40,780
I did Scotland once.
Never again.

134
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:42,848
Who the hell climbs
in weather like that?

135
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:45,917
Yeah, well, any fool can
climb when the sun's out.

136
00:10:45,952 --> 00:10:47,182
We'll see.

137
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,793
I can feel the altitude.

138
00:10:53,828 --> 00:10:55,619
I mean, come on.

139
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:58,732
You just ascended a third of
Mount Everest in 20 minutes.

140
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:01,999
Push through, man. Couple of
days, you won't even notice it.

141
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:11,338
Ah,<i> au revoir,</i> motherfuckers!

142
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:12,636
Yee-hoo!
Be safe.

143
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,374
<i>Au revoir.
Tres bien.</i>

144
00:11:19,183 --> 00:11:20,952
Hey! Isa.

145
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:30,027
Hey, Michael, this is
Isabelle. She's one of us.

146
00:11:30,062 --> 00:11:31,523
Not much of a climber, though.

147
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,195
And you're not much of a skier.

148
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,966
Ooh.

149
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:39,729
First day?

150
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:41,236
Yeah.

151
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,501
I can see that.

152
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:45,944
He's used to climbing molehills
in Scotland.

153
00:11:45,979 --> 00:11:47,638
And Wales.

154
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,640
And Wales.
Yeah, he's just finding out

155
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,049
what thin air tastes like,
that's all.

156
00:11:56,451 --> 00:11:59,320
We're gonna see how the
Englishman copes at altitude.

157
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:03,687
All righty.
Well, good luck and be safe.

158
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,260
- You too.
- Thanks.

159
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:36,390
Hey, this is slow, Michael.
Even for you. Come on.

160
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:40,130
I haven't acclimatized yet.
Gimme a break.

161
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:55,574
Don't get used to
these baby rocks, Michael.

162
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,543
You won't find them
on the Matterhorn.

163
00:12:57,578 --> 00:12:59,281
Shit.
Well, I'd better go home then.

164
00:12:59,316 --> 00:13:01,811
Too late, baby!
I got you now.

165
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:03,747
Whoo-hoo!

166
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,860
Hey, honey,
JP's climbing faster than you.

167
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:11,227
If he tries to pass you,
push him off.

168
00:13:11,262 --> 00:13:12,965
I'll say it was an accident.

169
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:29,212
All right, let's go.

170
00:13:30,182 --> 00:13:31,775
Hey, Michael,

171
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,381
look beneath your feet, man!

172
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:35,680
Yee-hoo-hoo!

173
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:38,155
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

174
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,620
Yeah!

175
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,963
That's a keeper, my friend.

176
00:13:44,966 --> 00:13:46,823
You don't wanna wait
for JP and Michael?

177
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:49,298
I need a beer.

178
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,498
There's no bar up here
last I checked.

179
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,435
They'll catch up.
Okay.

180
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,866
Well, age before beauty.

181
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:58,637
Mwah.

182
00:14:14,358 --> 00:14:17,392
Come on, Mikey.
Last few steps. Almost there.

183
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:21,099
Heh heh, yeah!

184
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:24,102
Yeah.

185
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:26,830
Whoo-hoo!

186
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:32,506
Welcome to the asylum
above 4,000 meters!

187
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,947
You nutter, huh?

188
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,916
Worth bleeding for?

189
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:39,546
That's the altitude, man.

190
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:40,844
Worth bleeding for.

191
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,681
Yeah.

192
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,749
This is only
the beginning, mate.

193
00:14:50,955 --> 00:14:53,032
Come on. We're gonna miss
the last lift.

194
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:54,792
Ah, we'll make it!

195
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,200
Yeah, you might.

196
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:57,861
He looks fried.

197
00:14:57,896 --> 00:14:59,929
Well, I made it
to the top, didn't I?

198
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:02,503
Yeah, and it beat the crap
out of you in the process.

199
00:15:02,538 --> 00:15:04,274
The Dent's a training climb.

200
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:07,508
There's no skills required,
just big fat ropes.

201
00:15:07,543 --> 00:15:10,379
Did you shit yourself while you were up
there, Michael? You need a fresh diaper?

202
00:15:10,414 --> 00:15:13,580
No, I already went. I'll save
you one for the Matterhorn.

203
00:15:13,615 --> 00:15:17,056
I love a good dick-measuring
contest. I'll just get mine out.

204
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:18,948
Ugh, please don't.

205
00:15:18,983 --> 00:15:21,687
And you can put yours back in
your pants for now, Leo, okay?

206
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:22,963
Okay, okay.

207
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,923
Hey, don't worry about him.

208
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,861
The locals take a while
to warm up. That's all.

209
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,731
He's about as local as I am.

210
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,469
Well, he's not French.

211
00:15:34,504 --> 00:15:36,240
But this is Chamonix.

212
00:15:36,275 --> 00:15:39,144
The only way to be one
is to put in the time.

213
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:40,211
He's earned it.

214
00:15:48,683 --> 00:15:50,947
Oh, right.
Thank you, Laura.

215
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,662
Mmm.

216
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,247
Ah, man.

217
00:16:16,282 --> 00:16:17,875
Who was that?

218
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,515
Mm. A client.

219
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,947
Like, just because I
laugh at one of his jokes,

220
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:26,015
he thinks it's a come on.

221
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,127
I would.
I know you would,

222
00:16:28,162 --> 00:16:29,194
you little pig.

223
00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:31,493
Oh, ho ho! Okay.

224
00:16:31,528 --> 00:16:33,231
<i>Salut,</i> Michael.
<i>Salut.</i>

225
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,534
<i>Merci.</i>

226
00:16:40,372 --> 00:16:42,207
<i>Santé.
Santé. Santé.</i>

227
00:16:49,381 --> 00:16:51,084
So, what are we doing tomorrow?

228
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:52,580
I'm working tomorrow.

229
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:54,813
Leo's guiding. Uh... Oh.

230
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,221
What about you, Isa?

231
00:16:56,784 --> 00:16:58,014
What?

232
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:00,258
I'm doing nothing. Why?

233
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:03,459
Why don't you take
Michael skiing, hmm?

234
00:17:03,494 --> 00:17:05,824
He should get into the
glacier every chance he gets.

235
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,332
I need him acclimatized
for the Matterhorn.

236
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:12,369
Do you ski well? Well, you're not
gonna have to babysit me or anything.

237
00:17:12,404 --> 00:17:14,536
I won't. Keep up.

238
00:17:16,672 --> 00:17:18,936
Ooh...

239
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:16,301
Okay.

240
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,605
Okay, yes.

241
00:18:39,524 --> 00:18:41,425
Hello.

242
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,954
Mm.
Is that a Super 8?

243
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:43,988
Yeah.

244
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:45,858
Late '70s model.

245
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:47,893
I just love the images.

246
00:18:47,928 --> 00:18:49,499
Soft and imperfect.

247
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,337
There is no romance
with digital.

248
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,208
You want to have a try?
Sure.

249
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,474
You just have to squeeze
the trigger there

250
00:18:57,509 --> 00:18:59,069
and you're rolling.
Okay.

251
00:19:01,777 --> 00:19:03,139
Hello!

252
00:19:03,174 --> 00:19:04,712
Me?
Yes, you.

253
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,516
I'm camera shy.

254
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:07,781
I don't know what to do.

255
00:19:07,816 --> 00:19:09,046
Oh, are you now?

256
00:19:10,522 --> 00:19:11,818
I am.

257
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:14,260
Mm.

258
00:19:16,528 --> 00:19:18,759
So, what's the deal
with you and Jean Pierre?

259
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,333
Are you like, uh...

260
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,799
Like?
You know, dating or...

261
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,804
Well, we're good friends.

262
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:33,136
He's like a brother
to me now, you know.

263
00:19:35,415 --> 00:19:37,206
What do you mean now?

264
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:39,208
You have so many questions!

265
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:40,550
I... Uh...

266
00:19:40,585 --> 00:19:43,146
Well, yeah, we've been dating.

267
00:19:43,885 --> 00:19:45,951
Like two or three years ago.

268
00:19:45,986 --> 00:19:48,954
And, actually,
he was my first love.

269
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:50,230
Right.

270
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,056
Why?

271
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,563
Are you jealous, Michael?

272
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,269
Course not.

273
00:19:58,262 --> 00:19:59,338
Liar.

274
00:20:42,812 --> 00:20:44,108
Jesus.

275
00:20:46,585 --> 00:20:50,114
- Poor bastards.
- Come August,

276
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,622
they'll be dying
almost every day out here.

277
00:21:22,456 --> 00:21:23,785
Nice one.

278
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,085
Yeah, man.

279
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,461
The face is pretty loose.

280
00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:32,893
Yeah. It will settle.

281
00:21:32,928 --> 00:21:34,862
Plenty of good ice
further up the route.

282
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,476
He's fast!

283
00:21:45,677 --> 00:21:47,105
Definitely better than us.

284
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,272
Yeah, he's in
a different league.

285
00:21:55,852 --> 00:21:57,115
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

286
00:22:00,384 --> 00:22:03,352
Man, that's Damien Roux.
The guy's a movie star here.

287
00:22:03,387 --> 00:22:04,661
Yeah, he's pretty insane.

288
00:22:04,696 --> 00:22:06,498
Oh, man, look at that!

289
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,566
That's climbing.
All right.

290
00:22:10,064 --> 00:22:11,261
I'll take the next pitch.

291
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,900
You sure?
Yeah!

292
00:22:12,935 --> 00:22:14,803
All right.
But don't hang about.

293
00:22:14,838 --> 00:22:17,674
I wanna be on the summit
long before sunset, okay?

294
00:22:31,624 --> 00:22:32,557
Agh!

295
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:02,279
Yeah, we made it, man!

296
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,018
Yep.

297
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:10,188
Whoo! Well done.

298
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:20,506
Whoo-hoo!

299
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:21,573
Yes!

300
00:23:28,813 --> 00:23:31,077
Lucy would love this.

301
00:23:31,112 --> 00:23:32,650
Your sister could have led that

302
00:23:32,685 --> 00:23:34,751
with one hand
tied behind her back, man.

303
00:23:34,786 --> 00:23:36,115
Yeah.

304
00:23:37,723 --> 00:23:40,119
This should have been
her mountain.

305
00:23:40,154 --> 00:23:42,451
Why do you think
I sent the postcard, eh?

306
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,530
Oh, okay.

307
00:23:49,603 --> 00:23:51,504
I'm gutted she never
made it out here.

308
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,836
But you did.

309
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:55,475
That counts for something.

310
00:23:56,973 --> 00:23:58,005
Yeah.

311
00:23:58,942 --> 00:23:59,974
Yep.

312
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:03,978
You want a picture?

313
00:24:04,618 --> 00:24:06,046
No.

314
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:07,487
This is enough.

315
00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:09,588
Hell yeah.

316
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:24,163
Leo reckons the
weather's breaking for the Eiger.

317
00:24:24,198 --> 00:24:27,001
There's gonna be a window
in the next couple of days, man.

318
00:24:27,036 --> 00:24:28,904
Don't start.
You just climbed

319
00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:30,367
the north face
of the Matterhorn.

320
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,138
You can do this.

321
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,174
I'm so tempted.

322
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:37,242
Stay one more day at least.

323
00:24:37,277 --> 00:24:39,717
You know, we're heading to
the Valley Noir in Italy tomorrow.

324
00:24:39,752 --> 00:24:42,016
Yeah. It's kind of
a tradition we have

325
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:43,688
to mark the summer solstice.

326
00:24:43,723 --> 00:24:45,591
I know. You've said.

327
00:24:45,626 --> 00:24:47,824
And it's the last chance
to ski the glacier.

328
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:49,595
I've skied the glacier.

329
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,696
Not like this, my friend.
Not like this.

330
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:57,493
Look, I'd love to,
but I've gotta go.

331
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:04,742
I can't miss that ferry.

332
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:06,546
Yeah.

333
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:09,846
She likes you I think.

334
00:25:09,881 --> 00:25:12,211
Who?
You know who.

335
00:25:12,246 --> 00:25:15,115
We went skiing, Jean Pierre,
that's all.

336
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,381
Chamonix gossips, my friend.
We went skiing!

337
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,350
Chamonix gossips!
We went skiing!

338
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,193
Ooh, it's baking down here now.

339
00:25:27,228 --> 00:25:29,701
Yeah.
Must be 80/85.

340
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,901
Gotta stop talking in
Fahrenheit. No one understands!

341
00:25:31,936 --> 00:25:33,804
Yes, please, sir.

342
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,003
And feet.

343
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:36,400
Why do you use feet, bro?

344
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:37,709
Yep.
I don't get it.

345
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,238
Meters and Celsius, honey.

346
00:25:39,273 --> 00:25:41,042
- Okay, it's fucking hot, man.
- Better.

347
00:25:41,077 --> 00:25:42,615
But it's still cool up high.

348
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,650
That's what matters.
<i>Oui.</i>

349
00:25:44,685 --> 00:25:45,684
Yo!

350
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,622
Hey, Mikey! There he is!

351
00:25:49,657 --> 00:25:50,887
- You good?
<i>- Ca va?</i>

352
00:25:50,922 --> 00:25:51,789
Aha!

353
00:25:53,892 --> 00:25:55,089
What about your job?

354
00:25:55,124 --> 00:25:56,255
Ah, I'll get fired.

355
00:25:56,895 --> 00:25:58,191
What about your father?

356
00:25:58,226 --> 00:26:00,556
Well, he told me
to follow my dreams.

357
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:02,294
Whoa, he actually said that?

358
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:04,230
No, he called me
a cunt and hung up.

359
00:26:04,265 --> 00:26:08,498
Ah.. Well, life's
not over yet my friend.

360
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,599
You're surfing. Hm?

361
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:11,743
Yo!

362
00:26:13,813 --> 00:26:15,142
You coming up?

363
00:26:15,177 --> 00:26:16,748
Ah, no, I didn't bring any skis.

364
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,013
I just came to say hi.

365
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:19,443
No way, man.

366
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:21,445
You can't miss this ride.

367
00:26:22,756 --> 00:26:24,954
You brought a spare pair?

368
00:26:24,989 --> 00:26:27,418
Thanks, man. You haven't
seen what we're skiing yet.

369
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:28,925
Exactly!

370
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,795
I'm ready. Whoo!
<i>On y va.</i>

371
00:26:36,627 --> 00:26:38,429
<i>A ce soir.</i>

372
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,167
Whoo-hoo!

373
00:26:44,877 --> 00:26:46,206
Michael!

374
00:26:47,143 --> 00:26:49,011
<i>Ca va?</i>

375
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:53,477
Whoo!

376
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,790
Whoo-hoo!

377
00:27:01,355 --> 00:27:02,992
<i>Allez!</i>

378
00:27:03,027 --> 00:27:04,356
Whoo-hoo!

379
00:27:10,804 --> 00:27:12,067
Come on, Michael!

380
00:27:12,102 --> 00:27:13,101
Oh, shit!

381
00:27:15,336 --> 00:27:16,599
Shit!

382
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:19,877
Oh, shit!

383
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:33,154
Oh, fuck.

384
00:28:01,382 --> 00:28:02,414
Michael!

385
00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:07,859
You made a left
through the ice tunnel?

386
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,224
Isabelle told me.
That's fucking nuts, man!

387
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:12,358
Yeah, it was a wrong
turn. No, no, no.

388
00:28:12,393 --> 00:28:16,032
It's only a wrong turn if you
don't make it out, right?

389
00:28:17,035 --> 00:28:18,661
Did you hear about this?

390
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,905
He was skiing like he was
Roger Moore or some shit.

391
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,007
Heard he went
full-on <i>View to a Kill</i> up there.

392
00:28:24,042 --> 00:28:27,340
Almost like he's one
of our own. Aw, Leo.

393
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:29,848
Anybody who climbs the north
face of the Matterhorn in one day

394
00:28:29,883 --> 00:28:31,476
gets my vote.

395
00:28:31,511 --> 00:28:34,050
Well, it was pretty messy, okay?

396
00:28:34,085 --> 00:28:35,447
It can be messy.

397
00:28:35,482 --> 00:28:37,482
It's a big fucking tick, man.

398
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:40,188
And that's all you're getting.

399
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,554
I'll take it.

400
00:28:46,361 --> 00:28:48,559
I bet that was hard for him.

401
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:52,167
Well, he sees a lot of fresh faces
come up to Chamonix, Michael.

402
00:28:52,202 --> 00:28:53,630
All gear and no idea.

403
00:28:54,765 --> 00:28:56,006
You can't just expect him

404
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:57,843
to welcome you in
with open arms.

405
00:28:57,878 --> 00:28:59,306
Yeah.
Gotta earn that.

406
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,606
I think you just did.

407
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:04,212
Really?
Mm-hmm.

408
00:29:04,247 --> 00:29:05,708
Yeah.

409
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:08,381
Oh, we all love you, Michael.

410
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:12,517
But I don't think I'm the girl you
should be talking to right now.

411
00:29:14,257 --> 00:29:15,795
Go get 'em, tiger.

412
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:25,464
Hello.

413
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:29,765
You look, uh,
you look good tonight.

414
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:32,042
Only tonight?

415
00:29:32,077 --> 00:29:34,110
N... Not just tonight.

416
00:29:34,145 --> 00:29:37,245
I'm sorry, I've, uh,
I've had a few beers.

417
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,215
Wow, you really know
how to make a girl feel special.

418
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,810
No, come on.
That's not what I meant.

419
00:29:41,845 --> 00:29:44,285
You know what I meant.
So what did you mean?

420
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,991
Well, I said it before,
that you look...

421
00:29:47,961 --> 00:29:49,961
You look beautiful.

422
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:53,591
You got anything else
than I'm beautiful?

423
00:29:54,858 --> 00:29:56,231
It's a bit lousy.
Okay.

424
00:29:56,266 --> 00:29:57,628
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

425
00:29:57,663 --> 00:30:00,268
Uh... Mm...

426
00:30:00,303 --> 00:30:02,666
It was really special
skiing with you today.

427
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:06,472
And what was so special
about skiing with me?

428
00:30:08,047 --> 00:30:09,211
The chase.

429
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,579
And what do you plan to do
if you got me?

430
00:30:16,517 --> 00:30:17,549
Hmm?

431
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:28,791
So, why did you come back?

432
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:34,599
Well, 'cause I wanted to climb
and help JP realize his dream.

433
00:30:34,634 --> 00:30:36,876
Mm. That's the only reason
you stayed?

434
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,241
Well, it's not the only reason.

435
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:42,013
So?

436
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,674
Are you really gonna
make me say it?

437
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,643
Yeah.

438
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:47,381
Because I wanted to see you.

439
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:52,419
And I thought that maybe...

440
00:31:22,286 --> 00:31:23,351
Mm...

441
00:31:25,058 --> 00:31:27,091
Mm...

442
00:31:29,425 --> 00:31:30,655
Good morning.

443
00:31:31,955 --> 00:31:33,658
Did you sleep well?

444
00:31:33,693 --> 00:31:35,693
Mmm...

445
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:37,266
Mmm...

446
00:31:40,469 --> 00:31:43,371
I'm going for a swim.

447
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:47,573
Isn't it a bit cold?

448
00:31:47,608 --> 00:31:48,772
No.

449
00:31:52,514 --> 00:31:53,744
Ooh la la!

450
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:02,456
It's good!

451
00:32:02,491 --> 00:32:03,391
Yeah?

452
00:32:47,305 --> 00:32:49,404
Hey...
Hey!

453
00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:57,247
So we're holding hands now?

454
00:32:57,282 --> 00:32:59,546
Ah. You can let go
anytime.

455
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:08,016
Then put it through the till
like any other bar beer.

456
00:33:08,051 --> 00:33:10,623
That's pretty much it.
Got it.

457
00:33:10,658 --> 00:33:13,164
It's a boring job but pays
enough to get up to the glacier.

458
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,023
That's all that
really matters, right?

459
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:16,761
Yep.

460
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,902
There he is!
With a whole new career.

461
00:33:27,345 --> 00:33:29,378
How did it go, lover boy?

462
00:33:29,413 --> 00:33:31,908
All right, you
don't have to say a word.

463
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,580
How's working with Béa?

464
00:33:33,615 --> 00:33:35,978
Yeah, she's cool.
Yeah, she's cool, man.

465
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:38,156
She's playing the same game
as the rest of us.

466
00:33:38,191 --> 00:33:40,686
Just waiting to become
the next big thing.

467
00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:43,018
How good is she?

468
00:33:43,053 --> 00:33:46,296
Man, she was hot
for a little while.

469
00:33:46,331 --> 00:33:48,397
Then her sponsor
got a crush on someone new.

470
00:33:48,432 --> 00:33:50,267
Someone crazier.

471
00:33:50,302 --> 00:33:53,336
She's gotta up her game though.
Bust some big-ass routes.

472
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,669
Just like you, right?

473
00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:58,242
Ah, Mikey, Mikey.

474
00:33:58,277 --> 00:34:00,508
You know, if you stay
in your comfort zone,

475
00:34:00,543 --> 00:34:03,775
you'll stay here behind this
shitty bar for the rest of your life.

476
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:06,118
Come on. You know, this
life-and-death business

477
00:34:06,153 --> 00:34:07,944
is very fickle.

478
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:12,388
It's Damien Roux.
Hey, turn this up, would you?

479
00:34:18,858 --> 00:34:20,022
Yeah, Damien!

480
00:34:55,158 --> 00:34:56,597
Yeah, my man!

481
00:34:56,632 --> 00:34:57,796
Yes.

482
00:35:38,278 --> 00:35:40,135
Harder ground's
not stopping him.

483
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,104
He'll need to slow down
on the crux pitch.

484
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:43,479
There's no shortcuts.

485
00:36:13,236 --> 00:36:14,774
Holy crap!

486
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:15,841
This guy is nuts.

487
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:17,249
Wait, lemme see.

488
00:36:17,284 --> 00:36:19,174
Wait.
Lemme see!

489
00:36:40,472 --> 00:36:41,900
Damien, you legend!

490
00:37:09,501 --> 00:37:11,270
Turn the music off!

491
00:37:12,262 --> 00:37:13,965
Turn the music off now!

492
00:37:15,265 --> 00:37:18,233
Turn the goddamn
fucking music off!

493
00:37:18,268 --> 00:37:20,279
Don't make me
come up there, asshole!

494
00:37:28,586 --> 00:37:30,619
<i>Hero amongst
the climbing fraternity,</i>

495
00:37:30,654 --> 00:37:32,181
<i>veteran of the Alps,</i>

496
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:33,886
<i>Damien Roux has been killed</i>

497
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:35,756
<i>attempting a new speed record</i>

498
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:38,363
<i>on the route Divine Providence
on Mont Blanc.</i>

499
00:37:38,398 --> 00:37:41,091
<i>He is the latest victim
in a string of accidents</i>

500
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:43,929
<i>to take place in the Alps
this summer.</i>

501
00:37:43,964 --> 00:37:46,899
One moment he was just
picking it to shreds,

502
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:48,835
unlocking all these moves
and then...

503
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:51,233
I feel sick.

504
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:53,235
I feel a lot of things.

505
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,907
Surprise ain't one of them.

506
00:37:55,778 --> 00:37:58,416
Dance music, a fucking DJ?

507
00:37:58,451 --> 00:38:00,550
It wasn't climbing,
it was a freak show

508
00:38:00,585 --> 00:38:04,851
set up by his sponsors demanding
bigger, bolder, scarier routes.

509
00:38:04,886 --> 00:38:06,655
That's what
we all came to see, Leo.

510
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,492
They pushed him too hard, man.

511
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:11,462
You saw those slick moves
and the flashy touches.

512
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,090
That's showboating.
No.

513
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,796
Damien is a legend.
One of a kind.

514
00:38:15,831 --> 00:38:19,096
Yeah, you keep telling a man
that, he'll start to believe you.

515
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:21,934
Vanity is a deadly thing
to bring into these mountains.

516
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:44,528
Come in!

517
00:38:45,828 --> 00:38:47,564
- Hello, hello!
- Hey!

518
00:38:49,392 --> 00:38:52,470
Cold snap's kicked out a good dusting
of snow on the Bernese Oberland.

519
00:38:52,505 --> 00:38:55,033
Folks round Interlaken reckon
the Eiger's gonna play ball.

520
00:38:55,068 --> 00:38:56,870
Yeah? She's in condition?

521
00:38:56,905 --> 00:38:58,872
About as good as
you're gonna get right now.

522
00:38:58,907 --> 00:39:01,644
If you want it perfect,
wait till November.

523
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:02,711
Let's do this!

524
00:39:04,044 --> 00:39:04,911
Michael?

525
00:39:06,145 --> 00:39:08,046
We took 16 hours
on the Matterhorn.

526
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:11,181
We could have done it in ten.
The Eiger's twice the size.

527
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:14,052
You heard what he just said.
We might not get another chance.

528
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:17,561
That's a risk that could end in
disappointment, not... not death, JP.

529
00:39:20,423 --> 00:39:22,060
This is not about the Eiger.

530
00:39:22,095 --> 00:39:24,194
It's about Damien Roux.

531
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:26,196
You know why he's dead, Michael?

532
00:39:27,067 --> 00:39:28,297
'Cause free solo climbers

533
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:29,903
don't live to a ripe old age.

534
00:39:29,938 --> 00:39:32,840
That's just
a cold, hard fact of life.

535
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:34,710
No ropes, no partner.

536
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,042
Just a matter of time.

537
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:42,487
Me? I'd like to get back to some
good, old-fashioned mountaineering.

538
00:39:42,522 --> 00:39:44,720
Put yesterday behind us.
Thank you.

539
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:47,690
Yo.

540
00:39:49,727 --> 00:39:51,694
That's what separates
him and us.

541
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:55,423
And I'll be at the end
of that rope,

542
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:57,359
babysitting you as always.

543
00:39:57,394 --> 00:39:59,196
And just remember, Michael,

544
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:01,737
yes or no is the right answer.

545
00:40:01,772 --> 00:40:04,201
I won't climb with you
on a maybe.

546
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:06,940
You make your decision,
we'll back you either way.

547
00:40:17,788 --> 00:40:19,084
Hey, Michael.

548
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:22,692
Hello.
Hey.

549
00:40:22,727 --> 00:40:24,419
It's not so bad here.

550
00:40:24,454 --> 00:40:26,256
No, best hotel in Chamonix.

551
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:29,633
And how is your room service?

552
00:40:31,065 --> 00:40:32,328
You're looking at it.

553
00:40:32,935 --> 00:40:34,506
Mm, cup of tea?

554
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:36,838
No, no, no, I don't drink tea.

555
00:40:38,138 --> 00:40:40,138
I'm not one of
your English girls, Michael.

556
00:40:40,173 --> 00:40:41,304
Okay.

557
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:45,341
Mm. In the backpack.

558
00:40:47,477 --> 00:40:51,149
The real gourmet stuff.

559
00:40:51,184 --> 00:40:54,152
But I see something interesting.

560
00:40:55,188 --> 00:40:57,826
Mm-hmm-hmm.
Let's have a look.

561
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,698
<i>Oh, put a in.</i>

562
00:41:01,733 --> 00:41:04,327
That's a strong look.

563
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:06,901
I was young.

564
00:41:07,937 --> 00:41:09,970
Oh, who's this?

565
00:41:10,005 --> 00:41:11,972
She's very pretty.

566
00:41:12,975 --> 00:41:14,304
Should I be jealous?

567
00:41:15,648 --> 00:41:17,681
That's Lucy, my sister.

568
00:41:18,178 --> 00:41:19,210
Mmm.

569
00:41:22,116 --> 00:41:24,215
You do look a bit alike.

570
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,349
Same big, bright eyes.

571
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,158
Did I say something wrong?

572
00:41:36,669 --> 00:41:38,801
Uh, nothing.

573
00:41:41,564 --> 00:41:42,937
She's not with us anymore.

574
00:41:44,941 --> 00:41:47,271
Okay. I'm so sorry.

575
00:41:47,306 --> 00:41:49,944
If you want, we can
talk about something else.

576
00:41:49,979 --> 00:41:51,143
It's okay.

577
00:41:51,915 --> 00:41:53,343
Uh, I don't mind.

578
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:55,048
Are you sure?

579
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:58,150
Usually, uh, I can't stand
talking about her.

580
00:41:58,185 --> 00:42:00,251
I can barely even think
about her without...

581
00:42:04,829 --> 00:42:07,929
But out here, it's strange.

582
00:42:09,933 --> 00:42:11,867
It's like she's with us.

583
00:42:11,902 --> 00:42:14,298
I know it sounds silly.
No, it's not.

584
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:16,531
So, she was a climber too?
Yeah.

585
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,467
A good one.

586
00:42:23,606 --> 00:42:25,078
When my mum died,

587
00:42:25,883 --> 00:42:27,344
my dad...

588
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:29,577
kinda went off the deep end.

589
00:42:29,612 --> 00:42:33,592
He was pretty horrible
to be around.

590
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:36,056
Still is.

591
00:42:37,026 --> 00:42:39,521
Her solution was
to take us climbing.

592
00:42:39,556 --> 00:42:41,325
So, she got you hooked.

593
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,700
She did.

594
00:42:43,736 --> 00:42:45,065
When you climb,

595
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:47,397
it's like...

596
00:42:48,598 --> 00:42:50,367
nothing else exits.

597
00:42:51,942 --> 00:42:55,878
You know, there's no room
for bullshit, grief, pain.

598
00:42:55,913 --> 00:42:57,506
Only the present.

599
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:58,914
The next move.

600
00:43:00,643 --> 00:43:02,885
And what happened to her?

601
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,891
We were on a climb in Scotland,
and the weather turned.

602
00:43:08,926 --> 00:43:10,794
Total whiteout.

603
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:12,664
It... It was... It was scary.

604
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,458
When we got back
to the car park,

605
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:19,968
we were so buzzed that we'd made
it back that we had a couple of beers.

606
00:43:20,003 --> 00:43:21,167
Just a couple.

607
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,532
Take the edge off, you know.

608
00:43:24,777 --> 00:43:26,777
She was in such a rush
to get home.

609
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:28,977
She wanted to drive.

610
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:33,575
I just had this... feeling.

611
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:36,149
Like something bad
was gonna happen.

612
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:42,452
And I did nothing.

613
00:44:22,901 --> 00:44:25,132
Michael, get down!

614
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:30,874
Ah, fuck!

615
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:42,446
Fuck.

616
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,618
Michael! You all right?

617
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,356
Yeah.

618
00:45:08,276 --> 00:45:10,012
Hey, hey, get in!

619
00:45:31,068 --> 00:45:33,266
Whoa.

620
00:45:33,301 --> 00:45:35,235
The face is falling
to fucking bits.

621
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:38,733
The sun is warming up the face,
melting the ice.

622
00:45:38,768 --> 00:45:41,109
All that compacted rock's
come loose.

623
00:45:41,144 --> 00:45:44,343
We need to stop climbing now.
Bivvy at the Swallow's Nest.

624
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:47,412
See how it is tomorrow.

625
00:45:57,556 --> 00:46:00,392
Oh, my God.
All right now, you got this.

626
00:46:00,427 --> 00:46:01,492
Just get to me.

627
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:04,396
All right, honey,
I'm right here.

628
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:06,134
I'm right here.

629
00:46:06,169 --> 00:46:07,729
Okay.
Quick as you can.

630
00:46:09,106 --> 00:46:11,106
Hey!

631
00:46:11,141 --> 00:46:12,910
Hey, honey...

632
00:46:14,144 --> 00:46:16,276
All right, get to me.

633
00:46:18,313 --> 00:46:20,775
I got you!
Right, recover!

634
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:27,353
Gimme some slack!

635
00:46:29,852 --> 00:46:30,994
Come on.
Okay.

636
00:46:31,029 --> 00:46:32,061
All right.

637
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:37,935
Oh, my God!
That was close.

638
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:39,266
I'm sorry for freaking out.

639
00:46:39,835 --> 00:46:41,873
No, no, it's crazy.
It's still coming.

640
00:47:00,157 --> 00:47:01,860
<i>JP, Michael, come in.</i>

641
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:04,027
Yep, Leo.

642
00:47:04,062 --> 00:47:06,458
How are you two doing?
<i>We're at Death Bivvy,</i>

643
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:08,493
about to turn in
for the night. You?

644
00:47:08,528 --> 00:47:10,363
We're at Swallow's Nest.

645
00:47:10,398 --> 00:47:12,629
Could've gotten further,
but there's a lot of rockfall,

646
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:14,697
and we don't need to push it
right now.

647
00:47:14,732 --> 00:47:16,534
Yeah, it gets worse higher up.

648
00:47:16,569 --> 00:47:18,602
It's too warm,
there's not enough ice.

649
00:47:18,637 --> 00:47:20,307
<i>It's choppy as fuck.</i>

650
00:47:20,342 --> 00:47:22,606
Yeah, but should be fine
if we get moving early enough.

651
00:47:22,641 --> 00:47:25,279
It's your call, Leo.
What are you thinking?

652
00:47:25,314 --> 00:47:28,612
<i>I mean, Natascha and I
are above all the problems now.</i>

653
00:47:28,647 --> 00:47:31,813
We should be able to summit
pretty easily tomorrow.

654
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:34,156
You guys still got all that
bad shit in front of ya.

655
00:47:34,191 --> 00:47:37,753
Do you suggest a retreat?
Over.

656
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,723
Come on, man, he isn't
saying that. What the fuck?

657
00:47:40,758 --> 00:47:44,001
If you wanna go for the summit,
you gotta keep your foot down.

658
00:47:44,036 --> 00:47:46,729
Hit the face
before the sun comes up.

659
00:47:46,764 --> 00:47:49,666
Exactly what we're
planning to do, Leo.

660
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:54,077
What are you doing? It's a
fucking blitzkrieg on the ice fields.

661
00:47:54,112 --> 00:47:56,310
Get them off the damn thing.

662
00:47:56,345 --> 00:47:59,984
Hey, guys, you're still
close enough to Railway Tunnel.

663
00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:01,678
You might wanna consider
a retreat

664
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:03,647
<i>while you're still
in a position to do so.</i>

665
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:11,226
Fine, yes, we will.

666
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:13,096
Stay safe.

667
00:48:13,998 --> 00:48:17,067
<i>Always. We'll meet you in
Kleine Scheidegg tomorrow night</i>

668
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:19,102
<i>for a beer
no matter what you decide.</i>

669
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:22,270
Sure thing,
sure thing. Out.

670
00:48:25,275 --> 00:48:26,703
It's gotta be their choice.

671
00:48:28,971 --> 00:48:30,806
Do you think they'll turn back?

672
00:48:31,644 --> 00:48:32,775
Did we?

673
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,002
- A lot colder than yesterday.
- Yeah.

674
00:48:52,236 --> 00:48:53,961
Face looks pretty good.
Yeah.

675
00:48:53,996 --> 00:48:57,008
So, up or down?

676
00:49:01,179 --> 00:49:02,904
I don't know, man.

677
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:04,477
Ah...

678
00:49:04,512 --> 00:49:06,479
Couple hours and we
could be having breakfast

679
00:49:06,514 --> 00:49:08,316
with the best view
in Switzerland.

680
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,483
Eggs, bacon, coffee.

681
00:49:10,518 --> 00:49:15,125
Come on, man. I didn't come this
far to eat eggs and fucking bacon!

682
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,985
Now, come on, at least let's
try a couple more pitches.

683
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,855
See how it plays out.

684
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:21,791
So...

685
00:49:22,365 --> 00:49:23,826
up or down?

686
00:49:28,371 --> 00:49:29,931
More like it.

687
00:49:39,514 --> 00:49:41,448
It looks loose.

688
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:43,813
Not so bad.

689
00:49:44,783 --> 00:49:45,848
Small steps.

690
00:49:58,302 --> 00:50:00,401
All right. Come on.
Come across, man.

691
00:50:10,314 --> 00:50:12,248
Michael! Watch out!

692
00:50:16,155 --> 00:50:17,979
Oh, fuck!

693
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:19,486
Michael! Get over here!

694
00:50:19,521 --> 00:50:21,224
Hurry the fuck up, man!

695
00:50:24,922 --> 00:50:25,921
Hurry up!

696
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:30,068
Michael!
Come on, man!

697
00:50:31,434 --> 00:50:33,401
Come on, come on, come on!

698
00:50:33,436 --> 00:50:36,470
Forget the fucking ice screw
and get over here! Hurry!

699
00:50:42,412 --> 00:50:44,775
Michael! Get down!

700
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:14,772
Michael!

701
00:51:24,322 --> 00:51:25,453
No!

702
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:30,755
Michael!

703
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:31,921
Michael!

704
00:51:33,155 --> 00:51:34,231
Michael.

705
00:51:35,399 --> 00:51:37,168
Michael!

706
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,867
Can you reach the face?

707
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:48,641
I can't get it, man!

708
00:51:48,676 --> 00:51:51,974
Ah, fuck.

709
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:53,844
Try your ice axes!

710
00:52:04,153 --> 00:52:05,691
I can't reach!

711
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:08,298
Ah, fuck!

712
00:52:08,993 --> 00:52:10,696
<i>Put a in! Merde!</i>

713
00:52:10,731 --> 00:52:12,599
All right! Hold on!

714
00:52:12,634 --> 00:52:14,667
I'll rig a hoist!

715
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:25,678
<i>Vite, vite, vite, vite, vite.</i>

716
00:52:25,713 --> 00:52:27,108
<i>Allez, vite, vite, vite.</i>

717
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:52,342
I can't get it!

718
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:44,493
I got you, brother!

719
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,313
Fuck.

720
00:54:04,581 --> 00:54:06,284
I'm calling mountain rescue.

721
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:46,181
I'm all right. I'm not too bad.

722
00:54:49,659 --> 00:54:50,691
I'm okay.

723
00:54:51,661 --> 00:54:52,825
Yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay.

724
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:35,164
<i>Natascha, Leo,
lost to the Eiger.</i>

725
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:36,803
We're all grieving.

726
00:55:38,235 --> 00:55:41,170
The respect you commanded
was indisputable.

727
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,041
As was the love.

728
00:55:48,487 --> 00:55:52,379
We can all go crazy trying to
figure out what happened up there.

729
00:55:52,414 --> 00:55:53,754
Was it a slip?

730
00:55:53,789 --> 00:55:55,525
Was it a rockfall?

731
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,461
Did their gear fail?

732
00:55:57,496 --> 00:55:59,892
The truth is, we'll never know.

733
00:56:00,862 --> 00:56:02,565
But what we know

734
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,898
is that you guys
were together at the end.

735
00:56:05,933 --> 00:56:07,504
Whoo!
We love you!

736
00:56:07,539 --> 00:56:09,396
And we're fucking thankful
for that.

737
00:56:09,431 --> 00:56:11,871
Yeah. Yeah!

738
00:56:11,906 --> 00:56:14,676
And now, we raise our glasses,

739
00:56:14,711 --> 00:56:19,714
Yeah! and we drink the
biggest fucking toast we can!

740
00:56:19,749 --> 00:56:21,584
To you guys!

741
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:22,684
Leo!

742
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:23,751
Natascha!

743
00:56:23,786 --> 00:56:25,918
We fucking love you!

744
00:56:28,725 --> 00:56:30,417
We fucking love you!

745
00:56:30,452 --> 00:56:33,662
Can you reach the top?
Can you reach the top?

746
00:56:37,426 --> 00:56:39,734
We fucking love you!

747
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:46,708
We love you, guys!

748
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,442
I just don't understand.

749
00:56:55,477 --> 00:56:58,852
They're all laughing and
drinking as if nothing happened.

750
00:56:58,887 --> 00:57:00,249
It just doesn't feel right.

751
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:07,729
Wakey, wakey!

752
00:57:07,764 --> 00:57:08,994
Ah!

753
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:11,359
You ready?

754
00:57:13,605 --> 00:57:15,099
For what?

755
00:57:15,805 --> 00:57:17,002
Climbing. Come on.

756
00:57:18,434 --> 00:57:20,907
Are you serious?

757
00:57:20,942 --> 00:57:23,272
Two of your best friends have
just been put in the ground.

758
00:57:23,307 --> 00:57:24,944
This is how we honor them.

759
00:57:26,585 --> 00:57:28,618
Come on. Grab your harness,
get your gear.

760
00:57:31,117 --> 00:57:32,347
Five minutes.

761
00:58:13,225 --> 00:58:14,455
Hey, what's going on?

762
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:16,325
Low-Lower me down, man.

763
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,768
Why?
Lower me down!

764
00:58:23,169 --> 00:58:24,938
What the fuck happened up there?

765
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:31,043
Look, I'm not in the mood
for honoring anyone today.

766
00:58:33,212 --> 00:58:34,717
Hey, what's the matter?

767
00:58:34,752 --> 00:58:35,982
What's the matter?

768
00:58:36,017 --> 00:58:38,182
This place is insane.

769
00:58:38,217 --> 00:58:40,382
People are dropping like flies.

770
00:58:40,417 --> 00:58:43,594
Yeah, well, next summer,
it will be the same, man.

771
00:58:43,629 --> 00:58:46,553
Leo and Natascha may have died,
but they died doing what they loved,

772
00:58:46,588 --> 00:58:48,863
doing what they lived for.
Doing what they loved?

773
00:58:48,898 --> 00:58:50,733
Are you serious?

774
00:58:50,768 --> 00:58:53,395
They died screaming,
Jean Pierre.

775
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:55,166
Don't you get it?

776
00:58:55,201 --> 00:58:57,971
That's why
we come back out here.

777
00:58:58,006 --> 00:59:01,172
When we climb,
they're right here with us.

778
00:59:01,207 --> 00:59:03,647
They're alive again.
Don't you feel it?

779
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:08,377
Come on, you...
You can't quit now.

780
00:59:08,412 --> 00:59:10,313
Not when we're this close.

781
00:59:10,348 --> 00:59:11,688
The Eiger said no.

782
00:59:11,723 --> 00:59:14,251
Fine, we have to respect that.

783
00:59:15,551 --> 00:59:17,661
So we move on
to the White Mountain.

784
00:59:21,557 --> 00:59:22,666
I'm afraid.

785
00:59:22,701 --> 00:59:24,327
I know you're afraid.

786
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:27,462
I'm afraid too.

787
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:31,136
But everything we ever wanted
is on the other side of fear.

788
00:59:34,438 --> 00:59:36,680
I'm doing this with or
without you, Michael.

789
00:59:36,715 --> 00:59:38,473
So make a decision.

790
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:42,147
I'm not sharing my headstone
with some mountain, JP.

791
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:44,919
I can't do it.

792
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,400
<i>- Ca va?
- Comment allez-vous?</i>

793
01:00:06,008 --> 01:00:07,535
Mm-hmm.

794
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:16,819
Jean Pierre told me
that you're out now.

795
01:00:16,854 --> 01:00:19,921
Yeah, it's over.
Done.

796
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:29,161
I was thinking that maybe...
we could take your car.

797
01:00:29,196 --> 01:00:30,998
Just get away from here.

798
01:00:31,033 --> 01:00:33,770
Be our chance to be alone
and be ourselves.

799
01:00:33,805 --> 01:00:34,837
<i>Merci.</i>

800
01:00:35,807 --> 01:00:37,598
Nine days,

801
01:00:37,633 --> 01:00:40,337
that's all we have left,
and I have to leave, you know.

802
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:42,108
I hate that.

803
01:00:43,408 --> 01:00:44,847
We get together,

804
01:00:44,882 --> 01:00:47,476
then life gets in the way.

805
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:50,248
It doesn't have to.
Yeah, but it always does.

806
01:00:50,283 --> 01:00:51,678
Doesn't it?

807
01:00:51,713 --> 01:00:53,581
Come Christmas,

808
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:55,825
we would have gone
our separate ways

809
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,795
and you won't even know
what the fuck I look like.

810
01:01:00,359 --> 01:01:02,392
This self-pitying drunk act,

811
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:05,098
it's boring.

812
01:01:05,133 --> 01:01:07,265
Yeah.
Yeah, it doesn't suit you.

813
01:01:08,301 --> 01:01:09,498
That's not who you are.

814
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:11,203
That's not who I am?
Mm-mmm.

815
01:01:11,238 --> 01:01:13,502
I've known you
for seven fucking days.

816
01:01:13,537 --> 01:01:15,306
You don't...
You don't know who I am.

817
01:01:15,341 --> 01:01:18,045
I don't even know
who I fucking am, okay?

818
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,112
Enjoy.

819
01:01:20,082 --> 01:01:21,279
See ya later.

820
01:01:30,686 --> 01:01:32,829
Hey! Hey!

821
01:01:41,037 --> 01:01:45,072
<i>One of the stars
of the future, Jean Pierre Bourdain.</i>

822
01:01:45,107 --> 01:01:48,471
<i>I hear you've got something pretty
special lined up for later in the summer.</i>

823
01:01:48,506 --> 01:01:51,738
<i>Ooh, yeah. Well, I've seen a new
line on the Central Pillar of Frêney.</i>

824
01:01:51,773 --> 01:01:53,916
<i>Reckon we'll give it
a push, you know.</i>

825
01:01:53,951 --> 01:01:56,017
<i>Just gotta worry what I'm gonna
name it, that's all.</i>

826
01:01:58,186 --> 01:01:59,350
Shh! Shh!

827
01:02:02,388 --> 01:02:04,223
<i>Damien Roux
was tragically killed</i>

828
01:02:04,258 --> 01:02:07,193
<i>attempting a new record
on Divine Providence.</i>

829
01:02:07,228 --> 01:02:10,592
<i>How has his death affected
the climbing community?</i>

830
01:02:10,627 --> 01:02:11,967
<i>We're all bleeding, you know.</i>

831
01:02:12,002 --> 01:02:13,562
<i>Damien was the best.
Hands down.</i>

832
01:02:13,597 --> 01:02:15,333
<i>You know,
the way he was climbing,</i>

833
01:02:15,368 --> 01:02:17,038
<i>the way he was living his life,</i>

834
01:02:17,073 --> 01:02:19,909
<i>he's just one of
my biggest inspirations, really.</i>

835
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:22,703
<i>Do you reckon you might be looking
to set some speed records of your own</i>

836
01:02:22,738 --> 01:02:25,178
<i>in the next couple of years?
Ah, come on. Yeah, of course.</i>

837
01:02:25,213 --> 01:02:29,710
<i>Well, if I can attract some sponsors, stay
in mountain, keep on training every day...</i>

838
01:02:29,745 --> 01:02:32,086
<i>You know, anything's possible,
right? Watch this space.</i>

839
01:02:32,121 --> 01:02:34,121
<i>Absolutely, man, come on.</i>

840
01:02:34,156 --> 01:02:36,222
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

841
01:02:38,061 --> 01:02:40,457
<i>Say hello to my new
climbing partners!</i>

842
01:02:40,492 --> 01:02:42,558
<i>Well, mate, look,
best of luck for the future,</i>

843
01:02:42,593 --> 01:02:44,461
<i>and I'll see you guys very soon.</i>

844
01:02:44,496 --> 01:02:46,364
<i>We're gonna climb that</i>,<i> baby.</i>

845
01:02:46,399 --> 01:02:48,795
<i>Open your eyes, we are
the stars today.</i>

846
01:02:52,174 --> 01:02:53,701
Whoo!

847
01:03:17,463 --> 01:03:19,496
I just wanted to say that I...

848
01:03:20,466 --> 01:03:21,498
What?

849
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:25,007
I probably deserved that.

850
01:03:25,042 --> 01:03:28,439
And I can hit a lot harder.
You got off lightly.

851
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:31,607
Did I?
Mm-hmm.

852
01:03:34,282 --> 01:03:35,710
Because I like you.

853
01:03:39,155 --> 01:03:40,781
You like me?

854
01:03:40,816 --> 01:03:43,751
Not right now.

855
01:03:43,786 --> 01:03:48,492
You're insensitive,
you're a drunk. Dumb<i> connard.</i>

856
01:03:48,527 --> 01:03:50,362
That's all you are.

857
01:03:50,397 --> 01:03:52,529
<i>Canard?</i>
Yeah,<i> connard.</i>

858
01:03:52,564 --> 01:03:54,300
I'm a... I mean...

859
01:03:55,468 --> 01:03:56,698
I'm a duck?

860
01:03:57,833 --> 01:03:59,976
No. Asshole.

861
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:03,144
Yeah.

862
01:04:04,081 --> 01:04:05,377
I already knew that.

863
01:04:06,347 --> 01:04:07,379
Okay.

864
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:25,562
Get in.

865
01:04:28,105 --> 01:04:30,039
Oh, you smell so bad!

866
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:33,504
I can't... Oh,<i> put a in!</i> Oh, no.

867
01:04:33,539 --> 01:04:36,375
Mmm!

868
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:39,345
You smell like a vat of wine.
It's disgusting. Yeah?

869
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:40,841
Yeah.
Yeah.

870
01:04:40,876 --> 01:04:42,249
Go brush your teeth. Oh!

871
01:04:42,284 --> 01:04:45,153
Go brush your teeth.

872
01:04:45,188 --> 01:04:47,221
Please, go.
Okay.

873
01:04:56,496 --> 01:05:00,971
You thought a bit more about
what we were saying?

874
01:05:03,008 --> 01:05:08,176
You know, you and me
getting off a few days.

875
01:05:10,081 --> 01:05:12,114
I did, yeah.

876
01:05:15,086 --> 01:05:16,151
And?

877
01:05:21,653 --> 01:05:23,455
I need to go and see JP.

878
01:05:26,592 --> 01:05:27,723
About what?

879
01:05:29,925 --> 01:05:31,463
Mont Blanc.

880
01:05:32,664 --> 01:05:34,730
But you said you were finished.

881
01:05:38,505 --> 01:05:41,143
I'm his climbing partner,
Isabelle. What do you want?

882
01:05:43,279 --> 01:05:45,972
Well, from what I heard,
you've been replaced.

883
01:05:46,007 --> 01:05:47,875
With Béa and Rudi?
Mmm.

884
01:05:48,845 --> 01:05:50,317
They're not good enough.

885
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,122
He's not thinking straight.

886
01:06:01,198 --> 01:06:02,725
I don't know, just...

887
01:06:04,696 --> 01:06:06,498
Maybe you could...

888
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:11,701
just talk him out of it,
you know?

889
01:06:12,473 --> 01:06:13,505
For me?

890
01:06:16,609 --> 01:06:17,872
He won't listen.

891
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,512
You know that.

892
01:06:21,812 --> 01:06:24,450
He's climbing that white
mountain no matter what.

893
01:06:27,015 --> 01:06:29,059
That's his choice.

894
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:36,858
You know
he's obsessional and unbending.

895
01:06:41,865 --> 01:06:44,074
I can't believe I'm so stupid.

896
01:06:49,444 --> 01:06:50,806
Once again...

897
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:56,218
none of us stood a chance
against this place.

898
01:07:01,192 --> 01:07:02,884
I owe him.

899
01:07:02,919 --> 01:07:04,061
For what?

900
01:07:06,758 --> 01:07:09,132
He was there for me
when I needed him most.

901
01:07:10,091 --> 01:07:12,025
Okay? He... He...

902
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:14,368
He took me climbing,
he kept me busy,

903
01:07:14,403 --> 01:07:16,106
he kept me sane.

904
01:07:17,703 --> 01:07:20,506
And now
he's going to get you killed.

905
01:07:24,446 --> 01:07:27,084
Lucy died because I did nothing.

906
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:34,322
I'm not gonna let that happen
to my best friend, too. No.

907
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:45,399
Let's push.

908
01:07:46,435 --> 01:07:47,566
Come on.

909
01:07:49,405 --> 01:07:52,208
Yep, come on. I don't have
all day, man. Come on.

910
01:07:56,577 --> 01:07:57,939
He's not so bad.

911
01:08:01,076 --> 01:08:02,944
Yeah, well, it's only a 6c man.

912
01:08:02,979 --> 01:08:06,288
Should be running up that thing!
Hey, Rudi, you're shit.

913
01:08:10,954 --> 01:08:12,228
Come on, right foot.

914
01:08:14,529 --> 01:08:16,133
I want back in.

915
01:08:17,928 --> 01:08:19,961
Now you change your mind.

916
01:08:19,996 --> 01:08:21,996
Yeah, only because
I know you won't.

917
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:24,339
JP said you froze up
climbing Maladiere.

918
01:08:25,474 --> 01:08:27,243
Yeah, well, I wasn't feeling it.

919
01:08:27,278 --> 01:08:29,905
You want us to put our lives
on the line for how you feel?

920
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:30,972
No.

921
01:08:31,678 --> 01:08:32,908
Just him.

922
01:08:34,483 --> 01:08:36,681
You wanna tie in? Hmm?

923
01:08:40,588 --> 01:08:42,621
Not bad. Not bad.

924
01:08:50,994 --> 01:08:52,631
He's fast.

925
01:08:52,666 --> 01:08:54,930
Hardly the south face
of Mont Blanc, is it?

926
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:01,343
He's really fucking fast.

927
01:09:11,553 --> 01:09:14,015
You may come in useful
after all.

928
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:16,116
Let's go and knock
this bastard off.

929
01:09:47,721 --> 01:09:49,853
Looking good! Moving fast! Hey.
Yeah.

930
01:09:49,888 --> 01:09:51,624
Feeling good, man.

931
01:09:51,659 --> 01:09:52,889
Oh.

932
01:09:56,026 --> 01:09:57,366
Oh!

933
01:09:58,402 --> 01:09:59,434
- What the fuck?
- Oh!

934
01:10:00,932 --> 01:10:03,999
Guys! We've got a pair
of jokers above us.

935
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:06,166
What the fuck are these idiots
playing at?

936
01:10:06,201 --> 01:10:10,280
They've been kicking rocks down
on us the whole fucking time, huh?

937
01:10:10,315 --> 01:10:11,974
You shouldn't be here, assholes!

938
01:10:17,751 --> 01:10:19,454
<i>Merci, put a in!</i>

939
01:10:46,417 --> 01:10:47,845
<i>Ahi. Ahi.</i>

940
01:10:51,422 --> 01:10:52,685
Okay.<i> Uno.</i>

941
01:11:03,797 --> 01:11:04,928
<i>Tre! Ah!</i>

942
01:11:06,162 --> 01:11:08,261
Tino!

943
01:11:13,378 --> 01:11:15,169
<i>Attenzione!</i>

944
01:11:18,108 --> 01:11:19,415
Look out!

945
01:11:21,386 --> 01:11:23,276
Béa!

946
01:11:23,311 --> 01:11:24,783
Béa!

947
01:12:00,557 --> 01:12:02,788
Béa! Stay calm, Béa, okay?

948
01:12:02,823 --> 01:12:03,855
Stay calm!

949
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:07,958
Béa! Béa!

950
01:12:10,226 --> 01:12:12,127
Gimme some slack!
Yeah!

951
01:12:12,162 --> 01:12:14,899
JP! Yeah, I'm
here! I'm here, I'm here.

952
01:12:14,934 --> 01:12:16,835
I'm with you, I'm with you.

953
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:18,133
Give me rope.

954
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:24,337
Okay, coming! Coming!

955
01:12:24,372 --> 01:12:26,042
It's okay, it's okay.
I'm with you.

956
01:12:26,077 --> 01:12:27,780
I'm coming!

957
01:12:31,522 --> 01:12:34,149
I'm coming.
I'm coming, baby.

958
01:12:34,184 --> 01:12:35,623
Breathe in, breathe out.

959
01:12:37,121 --> 01:12:38,923
Show me. Wha...

960
01:12:41,257 --> 01:12:42,388
Look at me. Look at me. Okay.

961
01:12:42,423 --> 01:12:44,192
Don't look. Don't look.

962
01:12:44,227 --> 01:12:45,600
Don't look, okay?
Can you move it?

963
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:50,605
I got you. Béa, I got you.

964
01:12:53,907 --> 01:12:57,513
Here, take these. Béa,
take these. Ibuprofen?

965
01:12:57,548 --> 01:12:59,911
It's not much, but it should
take the edge off, okay?

966
01:13:07,954 --> 01:13:10,526
Okay, hey. Easy, easy.

967
01:13:10,561 --> 01:13:13,023
We're gonna call the rescue and
we're gonna have dinner tonight.

968
01:13:13,058 --> 01:13:15,256
Okay? Easy. Don't worry.

969
01:13:40,316 --> 01:13:42,448
The storm has
changed course. Yeah?

970
01:13:42,483 --> 01:13:44,252
It's gonna be here
within the hour.

971
01:13:44,287 --> 01:13:46,056
Coming in from the west. Shit.

972
01:13:46,091 --> 01:13:47,222
Means we won't see it
till it hits.

973
01:13:47,257 --> 01:13:48,454
Did you call Mountain Rescue?

974
01:13:48,489 --> 01:13:50,126
They're sending a party on foot

975
01:13:50,161 --> 01:13:52,799
but they have to come
up from Courmayeur. Fuck.

976
01:13:52,834 --> 01:13:54,361
They won't get here
until tomorrow.

977
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:56,033
Well, then we retreat.

978
01:13:56,068 --> 01:13:57,639
We dig in at the Eccles
shelter and we wait.

979
01:13:57,674 --> 01:13:59,432
No, we cannot turn back, man.

980
01:13:59,467 --> 01:14:00,807
That's exactly what
we're gonna do, Jean Pierre.

981
01:14:00,842 --> 01:14:02,303
Climb's over.
Michael,

982
01:14:02,338 --> 01:14:03,909
right below us
is the Frêney Glacier,

983
01:14:03,944 --> 01:14:05,878
worst avalanche black spot
on the whole massif.

984
01:14:05,913 --> 01:14:08,078
Yeah. Half
an hour of snow is all it needs.

985
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:15,151
No, we bivvy on the face.

986
01:14:15,686 --> 01:14:17,791
Wait for the storm to pass.

987
01:14:22,864 --> 01:14:24,259
That's it.

988
01:16:07,672 --> 01:16:08,869
Shit!

989
01:16:09,971 --> 01:16:11,201
What is it?

990
01:16:11,636 --> 01:16:14,567
The rescue team are holed up
at the Messina heart.

991
01:16:14,602 --> 01:16:16,206
They can't continue.

992
01:16:16,241 --> 01:16:17,944
They're gonna
wait out the storm.

993
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:21,409
Should pass in a few hours.

994
01:16:30,255 --> 01:16:32,255
It's another avalanche.
A big one.

995
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:34,389
Okay, there is no way down now.

996
01:16:49,472 --> 01:16:50,647
Isabelle.

997
01:17:12,033 --> 01:17:15,166
One, two, three.

998
01:17:17,665 --> 01:17:19,368
One kilometer away!

999
01:17:20,778 --> 01:17:23,471
I can't...
I can't feel my fingers.

1000
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:26,045
Give me your hand.
I got you.

1001
01:17:43,064 --> 01:17:44,195
Okay.

1002
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:50,135
<i>Merde!
Put a in!</i>

1003
01:17:52,205 --> 01:17:53,534
That's it.
That's all our fucking water!

1004
01:17:53,569 --> 01:17:55,569
All of it!
All of it gone!

1005
01:17:58,981 --> 01:18:00,508
Shut the fuck up.

1006
01:18:00,543 --> 01:18:03,214
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

1007
01:18:03,249 --> 01:18:05,381
Both of you!
It's gone, okay?

1008
01:18:05,416 --> 01:18:07,889
We're sitting on a giant
lightning conductor,

1009
01:18:07,924 --> 01:18:10,320
we need to get
the hell out of here. Now!

1010
01:18:10,355 --> 01:18:12,157
A rescue team will come.

1011
01:18:12,192 --> 01:18:13,521
In this?

1012
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:16,623
They're playing cards
in a cozy little hut

1013
01:18:16,658 --> 01:18:18,999
3,000 feet south of here,
and you're stalling.

1014
01:18:19,601 --> 01:18:22,596
If we don't make
a decision now, we die.

1015
01:18:22,631 --> 01:18:25,170
The only way down is up.

1016
01:18:26,668 --> 01:18:29,207
Look, we climb to the top
of the Pillar.

1017
01:18:29,242 --> 01:18:31,374
We follow the ridge
to the summit

1018
01:18:31,409 --> 01:18:33,640
and then we get to the
Vallot Hut and we dig in.

1019
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:35,180
Okay?
Come on.

1020
01:18:35,215 --> 01:18:37,545
Two hundred meters
in this storm?

1021
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:40,548
It's fucking suicide, man!
Béa has hypothermia!

1022
01:18:40,583 --> 01:18:42,418
We don't have enough time.
You cannot climb!

1023
01:18:42,453 --> 01:18:44,156
Not in this!
No, you can't!

1024
01:18:44,191 --> 01:18:46,554
You can't climb it!
Fuck you! For fuck's sake!

1025
01:18:46,589 --> 01:18:49,095
Listen. Three years ago,
Cairngorms,

1026
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:51,768
we got caught in all
fucking hell and I led us out.

1027
01:18:52,437 --> 01:18:55,332
Yeah. Yeah, he's right.
He's right.

1028
01:18:55,367 --> 01:18:56,564
He led us out.

1029
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:58,907
You have to trust me.

1030
01:18:58,942 --> 01:19:01,404
Rudi, I can do this.

1031
01:20:51,912 --> 01:20:54,022
Huh?

1032
01:20:54,591 --> 01:20:57,487
Rescue party?
Are you the rescue party?

1033
01:20:57,522 --> 01:21:01,095
There is no rescue party!
It's just us.

1034
01:21:02,065 --> 01:21:03,526
What happened?

1035
01:21:03,561 --> 01:21:05,033
Took a fall.

1036
01:21:05,068 --> 01:21:07,167
Broke his leg.
Frost bite.

1037
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:09,037
What about you?

1038
01:21:09,072 --> 01:21:10,940
One of us has a broken arm.

1039
01:21:10,975 --> 01:21:13,008
You dropped a rock the size
of a house on us.

1040
01:21:13,043 --> 01:21:14,372
The rock.

1041
01:21:15,243 --> 01:21:17,507
It broke like a rotten branch.

1042
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,180
Can you help us?

1043
01:21:24,384 --> 01:21:26,186
You have a tough rope.

1044
01:21:26,221 --> 01:21:28,683
Michael's gonna pull you,
but you have to climb!

1045
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:31,059
All right, take it!

1046
01:21:33,195 --> 01:21:34,425
Go Béa! Go!

1047
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:35,822
You can do it Béa! Go!

1048
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:52,949
Are you in?
Yeah.

1049
01:21:53,908 --> 01:21:55,710
Fucking novices.

1050
01:21:56,312 --> 01:21:58,845
We cannot take these two
with us. They're dead weight.

1051
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,188
We have to try.
No, we don't.

1052
01:22:01,223 --> 01:22:02,585
They're responsible
for themselves.

1053
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:04,488
They need our help, Jean Pierre!

1054
01:22:04,523 --> 01:22:06,292
They're gonna get us all killed!

1055
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:08,954
I'm climbing to the next stance.

1056
01:22:08,989 --> 01:22:11,066
Tino, you're next!

1057
01:22:11,101 --> 01:22:13,035
Okay, I'm gonna pull you up
on the rope.

1058
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:15,895
Use your arms, your good leg,
whatever will help me!

1059
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:18,601
I'm gonna get you up
this, all right? Pitch by pitch.

1060
01:22:28,646 --> 01:22:30,481
Come on. Get up!

1061
01:22:30,516 --> 01:22:32,615
Okay, safe!

1062
01:22:36,291 --> 01:22:38,291
Come on, Tino!

1063
01:22:38,326 --> 01:22:40,887
Take care. Take care!

1064
01:22:40,922 --> 01:22:42,394
Keep going!
Come on!

1065
01:22:43,133 --> 01:22:44,297
Come on, try!

1066
01:22:44,332 --> 01:22:45,991
I'm sorry.
Harder!

1067
01:22:49,568 --> 01:22:51,667
Michael!
It's not gonna work!

1068
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,934
Fuck!

1069
01:23:01,745 --> 01:23:03,976
Tino, you have to do this.

1070
01:23:04,011 --> 01:23:05,318
There's no other way.

1071
01:23:08,224 --> 01:23:11,786
Give us a fucking chance!
Piece of shit!

1072
01:23:13,229 --> 01:23:15,361
I couldn't limp across
the street, my friend.

1073
01:23:16,230 --> 01:23:18,529
How do you propose I can
traverse Monte Bianco?

1074
01:23:19,064 --> 01:23:21,466
My only chance is to wait here
for the rescue party.

1075
01:23:23,569 --> 01:23:26,372
Get out of here while
you still can. Please.

1076
01:23:28,772 --> 01:23:31,113
I stay with him.
Angelo, please.

1077
01:23:31,148 --> 01:23:33,148
Shut up.
Please! You don't need to.

1078
01:23:33,183 --> 01:23:35,117
You've said your piece.
I'm staying.

1079
01:23:35,152 --> 01:23:38,318
You and me, we get lifted off
this rock come the morning.

1080
01:23:41,422 --> 01:23:42,751
Right, boys?

1081
01:23:54,996 --> 01:23:56,270
I got you!

1082
01:24:25,301 --> 01:24:27,367
We did it, Michael.
How's your arm?

1083
01:24:27,402 --> 01:24:29,138
It's frozen below the elbow.

1084
01:24:34,068 --> 01:24:37,344
No! Béa! Béa

1085
01:24:37,379 --> 01:24:39,742
Béa! Béa!

1086
01:24:39,777 --> 01:24:40,743
Michael!

1087
01:24:41,746 --> 01:24:45,418
Fuck,<i> put a in!</i> No!

1088
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:49,653
Okay, JP! Clip on!

1089
01:24:51,459 --> 01:24:52,557
Go, JP!

1090
01:24:52,592 --> 01:24:53,591
Safe?

1091
01:24:55,265 --> 01:24:56,297
Okay!

1092
01:24:57,597 --> 01:24:59,058
<i>Allez,</i> go!

1093
01:25:17,716 --> 01:25:19,617
All right, clip in, clip in.

1094
01:25:19,652 --> 01:25:21,718
Okay.<i> C'est bon.
C'est bon.</i> You're on.

1095
01:25:22,523 --> 01:25:23,786
Fucking hell.

1096
01:26:35,123 --> 01:26:38,333
Come on, guys. Keep pushing!

1097
01:26:55,715 --> 01:26:57,913
Hey, this is
the summit, I think.

1098
01:26:58,685 --> 01:26:59,750
You sure?

1099
01:27:00,419 --> 01:27:02,588
Well, we can't go
no higher, Michael.

1100
01:27:02,623 --> 01:27:05,217
Guys, we need to dig
a shelter right now!

1101
01:27:05,252 --> 01:27:08,495
The Vallot Hut is over there!
A few hundred meters away!

1102
01:27:08,530 --> 01:27:10,189
Come on, we've gotta keep going.

1103
01:27:10,224 --> 01:27:11,399
Come on.

1104
01:27:12,001 --> 01:27:14,864
Okay, your call. Your
fucking call! Come on.

1105
01:27:27,681 --> 01:27:29,010
<i>Michael.</i>

1106
01:27:31,278 --> 01:27:32,684
<i>Michael.</i>

1107
01:27:35,953 --> 01:27:37,887
<i>Michael.
Michael, help me.</i>

1108
01:29:33,103 --> 01:29:35,169
What the hell
have you just done?

1109
01:29:35,204 --> 01:29:38,073
Fuck you!

1110
01:29:38,108 --> 01:29:40,581
That's his lifeline,
you fucking... Shut up!

1111
01:29:40,616 --> 01:29:43,309
He's gonna get
us all killed, man!

1112
01:29:43,344 --> 01:29:45,982
Are you nuts?
He's done what he wants.

1113
01:29:53,497 --> 01:29:55,123
Fuck you!

1114
01:29:56,599 --> 01:29:59,435
What the fuck have you done?
Huh? Huh?

1115
01:30:02,462 --> 01:30:04,473
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Mike! Mike!

1116
01:30:16,718 --> 01:30:17,915
You wanna die, man!

1117
01:30:20,447 --> 01:30:21,787
Not with you.

1118
01:30:57,825 --> 01:30:59,088
Jean Pierre?

1119
01:31:01,763 --> 01:31:03,191
Jean Pierre?

1120
01:31:10,574 --> 01:31:12,035
Jean Pierre?

1121
01:31:24,049 --> 01:31:27,083
That could be hundreds
of meters deep, man.

1122
01:31:27,855 --> 01:31:29,954
No way he survived this.

1123
01:31:29,989 --> 01:31:30,988
We're gonna find out.

1124
01:31:49,976 --> 01:31:51,206
Jean Pierre?

1125
01:31:51,241 --> 01:31:53,175
Michael.

1126
01:31:54,475 --> 01:31:56,046
I can't move.

1127
01:31:59,249 --> 01:32:00,985
I'm fucked.

1128
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:02,987
Stay there. Stay there.

1129
01:32:13,329 --> 01:32:15,032
I'm fucking dead, man.

1130
01:32:15,067 --> 01:32:16,462
You're gonna be fine.

1131
01:32:16,497 --> 01:32:17,738
Okay?

1132
01:32:17,773 --> 01:32:19,267
Rudi's gonna pull you up.

1133
01:32:19,902 --> 01:32:21,368
We're gonna get you out.

1134
01:32:21,403 --> 01:32:23,502
Okay Rudi! He's on!

1135
01:32:23,537 --> 01:32:25,372
Okay. Ready?

1136
01:32:25,407 --> 01:32:27,616
Here, ice ax.
Take it, take it.

1137
01:32:29,213 --> 01:32:30,509
Fuck.

1138
01:32:30,544 --> 01:32:33,017
On three. Okay Rudi?

1139
01:32:33,052 --> 01:32:35,547
When I say go, pull like hell!

1140
01:32:35,582 --> 01:32:38,352
Three, two, one.

1141
01:32:41,588 --> 01:32:43,093
Pull, Rudi!

1142
01:32:43,931 --> 01:32:45,491
Come on, JP.

1143
01:32:48,738 --> 01:32:50,463
Pull, Rudi!

1144
01:32:51,565 --> 01:32:52,674
Good job!

1145
01:33:01,179 --> 01:33:02,508
Rudi!

1146
01:33:08,252 --> 01:33:11,451
I got you, JP!

1147
01:33:25,269 --> 01:33:26,565
Rudi!

1148
01:33:33,475 --> 01:33:35,607
Rudi!

1149
01:33:39,151 --> 01:33:40,447
Rudi?

1150
01:33:47,797 --> 01:33:49,192
Rudi?

1151
01:34:10,050 --> 01:34:11,379
Not like this.

1152
01:34:12,448 --> 01:34:13,546
Not here.

1153
01:34:52,796 --> 01:34:55,830
I should have gone
for eggs and bacon.

1154
01:34:58,931 --> 01:35:03,233
Michael, I need you
to do something for me.

1155
01:35:04,874 --> 01:35:08,172
When you see my parents,
I want you to say that...

1156
01:35:08,207 --> 01:35:10,570
Don't say that, Jean Pierre.

1157
01:35:11,815 --> 01:35:13,474
We'll get you off this mountain.

1158
01:35:15,951 --> 01:35:17,709
Tell them I was happy.

1159
01:35:20,923 --> 01:35:24,221
Tell them you... you did
everything you could.

1160
01:35:24,256 --> 01:35:27,389
No way. All right, we're gonna
rest here for a few minutes.

1161
01:35:27,424 --> 01:35:30,491
Then we're gonna get our energy
back and I'll get you down.

1162
01:35:30,526 --> 01:35:34,132
I swear.
We're all gonna die here!

1163
01:35:34,167 --> 01:35:37,201
If we die, we die together.

1164
01:35:37,236 --> 01:35:39,137
'Cause I'm not leaving.

1165
01:35:40,006 --> 01:35:43,174
It doesn't...
doesn't hurt anymore.

1166
01:35:45,508 --> 01:35:47,739
Just rest here for a minute.

1167
01:35:54,088 --> 01:35:55,615
Just a couple...

1168
01:36:46,734 --> 01:36:47,876
Lucy?

1169
01:36:49,341 --> 01:36:50,439
I'm here.

1170
01:37:08,162 --> 01:37:09,854
I'm so sorry.

1171
01:37:09,889 --> 01:37:12,692
No. Michael, don't be.

1172
01:37:13,662 --> 01:37:15,266
<i>Michael?</i>

1173
01:37:15,301 --> 01:37:18,038
You have to go. Now.

1174
01:37:18,073 --> 01:37:20,403
- No.
<i>- Michael?</i>

1175
01:37:20,438 --> 01:37:22,075
I can't go back there.

1176
01:37:22,704 --> 01:37:24,209
I don't wanna go back.

1177
01:37:24,244 --> 01:37:26,343
- I wanna stay here.
<i>- Michael? Michael!</i>

1178
01:37:26,378 --> 01:37:28,378
I've missed you so much.

1179
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:32,151
<i>Michael! Michael!</i>

1180
01:37:32,186 --> 01:37:33,922
<i>Michael! Michael!</i>

1181
01:37:33,957 --> 01:37:36,188
Hey. Hey!

1182
01:37:36,223 --> 01:37:39,092
You cannot sleep.
You sleep, you die.

1183
01:37:39,919 --> 01:37:42,161
If we stay here, we die!

1184
01:37:42,196 --> 01:37:43,591
All right? Come on.

1185
01:37:45,034 --> 01:37:47,232
Jean Pierre.
Hey, wake up, man.

1186
01:37:47,267 --> 01:37:48,530
I couldn't wake him.
Huh?

1187
01:37:48,565 --> 01:37:49,894
He's gone.
No, shut up.

1188
01:37:49,929 --> 01:37:51,203
He's gone.
Come on, man!

1189
01:37:51,832 --> 01:37:53,271
Come on!
Michael.

1190
01:37:53,306 --> 01:37:55,339
Wake up!
Michael.

1191
01:37:56,210 --> 01:37:57,572
Michael.
Jean Pierre...

1192
01:37:57,607 --> 01:37:58,837
Michael!

1193
01:37:59,372 --> 01:38:00,806
Michael!
Jean Pierre, wake up, man.

1194
01:38:00,841 --> 01:38:03,710
Michael. Michael!
Wake up. What?

1195
01:38:03,745 --> 01:38:04,909
Michael!
What do you want?

1196
01:38:04,944 --> 01:38:06,251
Listen to me!

1197
01:38:06,286 --> 01:38:07,846
Jean Pierre?
He's gone, man!

1198
01:38:08,453 --> 01:38:09,584
He can't be.

1199
01:38:09,619 --> 01:38:10,684
Look...

1200
01:38:16,626 --> 01:38:17,790
I'm sorry.

1201
01:38:23,831 --> 01:38:25,336
We need to go, man.

1202
01:38:31,245 --> 01:38:33,542
I won't leave you here, okay?

1203
01:38:33,577 --> 01:38:34,840
Okay.

1204
01:38:34,875 --> 01:38:36,083
Okay.

1205
01:39:21,658 --> 01:39:24,164
Michael! Michael!

1206
01:39:24,199 --> 01:39:27,233
I see the hut! Follow me!

1207
01:39:27,268 --> 01:39:28,960
Follow me!

1208
01:39:28,995 --> 01:39:30,335
We can make it.

1209
01:39:36,310 --> 01:39:37,474
Help!

1210
01:39:41,876 --> 01:39:44,019
Help!

1211
01:39:56,594 --> 01:39:57,923
Michael!

1212
01:40:09,541 --> 01:40:11,409
- Sarah!
- Yeah?

1213
01:40:12,643 --> 01:40:15,644
Michael.
Stay with me. Look at me.

1214
01:40:30,298 --> 01:40:32,199
Michael...

1215
01:42:23,037 --> 01:42:24,179
Hello, you.

1216
01:42:31,716 --> 01:42:32,814
Béa...

1217
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:36,048
Jean Pierre...

1218
01:42:38,118 --> 01:42:39,524
I tried to get them down.

1219
01:42:45,565 --> 01:42:47,367
I crossed over, you know.

1220
01:42:51,406 --> 01:42:53,373
If I wanted to die,

1221
01:42:53,875 --> 01:42:56,442
all I had to do was...

1222
01:42:56,477 --> 01:42:57,806
lie down

1223
01:42:58,842 --> 01:43:00,248
and sleep.

1224
01:43:04,353 --> 01:43:06,111
That's when I saw them.

1225
01:43:10,249 --> 01:43:12,084
What did you see?

1226
01:43:14,495 --> 01:43:15,527
Ghosts.

1227
01:43:17,894 --> 01:43:20,400
Waiting for me to fall.

1228
01:43:22,998 --> 01:43:25,735
But there was someone else
up there, you know.

1229
01:43:30,478 --> 01:43:32,071
A presence...

1230
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:35,943
that was keeping me alive.

1231
01:43:38,585 --> 01:43:40,013
Willing me on.

1232
01:43:45,053 --> 01:43:46,888
In the end...

1233
01:43:48,628 --> 01:43:50,529
there are no ghosts.

1234
01:43:51,961 --> 01:43:53,125
No...

1235
01:43:54,128 --> 01:43:55,798
guardian angels.

1236
01:43:59,375 --> 01:44:00,935
Just you...

1237
01:44:04,270 --> 01:44:07,205
and how much you have
left in you to get home.

1238
01:44:07,944 --> 01:44:09,449
And you did.

1239
01:44:24,125 --> 01:44:26,829
I'm told my
son may never be found.

1240
01:44:28,371 --> 01:44:30,195
That Mont Blanc
is now his grave.

1241
01:44:41,813 --> 01:44:45,144
How was Jean Pierre...
at the end?

1242
01:44:52,527 --> 01:44:54,626
He died doing what he loved.

1243
01:44:56,025 --> 01:44:58,223
Not many of us
have that privilege.

1244
01:44:58,825 --> 01:45:00,368
Is that what you believe?

1245
01:45:06,299 --> 01:45:08,970
I'm not interested in
beautiful fiction, Michael.

1246
01:45:19,213 --> 01:45:20,652
We were in hell.

1247
01:45:24,988 --> 01:45:28,286
We were making strange
decisions up there.

1248
01:45:28,321 --> 01:45:29,529
Uh...

1249
01:45:33,128 --> 01:45:34,699
Decisions that now,

1250
01:45:35,735 --> 01:45:37,570
sitting opposite you...

1251
01:45:40,003 --> 01:45:42,971
I mean, they don't make sense.

1252
01:45:51,652 --> 01:45:53,916
He wanted me to tell you
something.

1253
01:45:56,217 --> 01:45:58,085
That he was happy...

1254
01:46:00,089 --> 01:46:01,352
at the end.

1255
01:46:04,731 --> 01:46:06,126
He wasn't crying.

1256
01:46:09,538 --> 01:46:11,131
He wasn't in pain.

1257
01:46:17,711 --> 01:46:20,712
The last thing I saw
on his face was a smile.

1258
01:46:24,245 --> 01:46:25,750
That's the truth.

1259
01:46:52,108 --> 01:46:53,140
So...

1260
01:46:54,748 --> 01:46:55,879
So...

1261
01:46:58,554 --> 01:47:02,083
I guess we just have to
step away from this place.

1262
01:47:03,284 --> 01:47:04,316
Just like that?

1263
01:47:05,924 --> 01:47:06,989
Are we...

1264
01:47:10,126 --> 01:47:12,291
You really wanna
end it like this?

1265
01:47:14,328 --> 01:47:16,097
Do you really think I want to?

1266
01:47:18,002 --> 01:47:19,540
It has to.

1267
01:47:20,175 --> 01:47:22,367
I can't be part of this
any longer.

1268
01:47:22,402 --> 01:47:24,974
I can't watch all
the people I love die.

1269
01:47:25,009 --> 01:47:27,746
I won't.
You won't have to, okay?

1270
01:47:27,781 --> 01:47:30,111
Come on. You and me,

1271
01:47:30,146 --> 01:47:33,521
let's go somewhere completely
different and never come back.

1272
01:47:34,854 --> 01:47:36,282
I would love that.

1273
01:47:36,984 --> 01:47:39,692
But you're always going to
carry that place in your heart.

1274
01:47:40,992 --> 01:47:43,223
You're going to miss it.
No, I'm done with it.

1275
01:47:43,258 --> 01:47:44,895
All of it.
No.

1276
01:47:44,930 --> 01:47:46,424
I promise.
No.

1277
01:47:46,459 --> 01:47:48,129
You say that now.

1278
01:47:49,638 --> 01:47:53,035
Sooner or later, you'll be
back on the mountain

1279
01:47:53,708 --> 01:47:55,235
and I'll be stuck in a hut

1280
01:47:55,270 --> 01:47:57,512
hoping that you
make it back down.

1281
01:47:58,147 --> 01:47:59,877
That's it.
It won't be like that.

1282
01:48:00,473 --> 01:48:01,505
I know.

1283
01:48:04,180 --> 01:48:06,213
Because I'm not going
to let it happen.

1284
01:48:12,287 --> 01:48:13,726
I fell in love with you,
you know.

1285
01:48:31,174 --> 01:48:33,240
That's why I have to go.

1286
01:48:42,086 --> 01:48:44,317
But we will always have
this place, right?

1287
01:48:55,737 --> 01:48:56,868
Okay.
