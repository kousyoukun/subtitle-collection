1
00:01:07,136 --> 00:01:09,275
[wind blowing]

2
00:01:18,748 --> 00:01:21,782
[birds singing]

3
00:01:56,181 --> 00:01:57,191
Doing good.

4
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:00,986
[blows]

5
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,362
[climbing partner]
Yeah.

6
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,991
Keep going. Yeah.

7
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,532
Just on the left.

8
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:12,767
Left foot where your knee is.

9
00:02:21,382 --> 00:02:24,647
Ugh... Agh... Huh!

10
00:02:24,682 --> 00:02:25,747
[grunts]

11
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:28,618
Fuck!

12
00:02:28,653 --> 00:02:30,554
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

13
00:02:31,755 --> 00:02:34,151
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

14
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:35,658
Slipped on the hold.

15
00:02:35,693 --> 00:02:36,758
[laughs]

16
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:41,334
Cogs beat the shit out
of me, man.

17
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,502
Almost had it.
Yeah. [grunts]

18
00:02:45,703 --> 00:02:47,197
Nice one.

19
00:02:47,232 --> 00:02:48,902
Ah, you made it look easy.

20
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,641
There's not a hundred people
in this country

21
00:02:51,676 --> 00:02:53,577
that could have made
that move, man.

22
00:02:53,612 --> 00:02:56,316
You're climbing two grades
better than last time.

23
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:57,383
Yeah.

24
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:02,487
[climbing partner]
Did I tell you I got
a few sponsors looking at me?

25
00:03:02,522 --> 00:03:03,719
Yeah?
Yeah.

26
00:03:03,754 --> 00:03:06,117
To climb
out in Chamonix, man.

27
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:09,054
If I can make
enough noise this summer,
they should bite.

28
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,495
Nice one, man.

29
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,332
Got a couple of interviews
lined up.

30
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:14,334
Planning on posting
some big routes.

31
00:03:14,369 --> 00:03:16,226
Yeah? Like what?

32
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:17,337
Like what?

33
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:19,097
Like Matterhorn,

34
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,439
Eiger

35
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:22,034
and the south face
of Mont Blanc.

36
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,102
Ah, the big three.

37
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,236
It's quite an ask.
Yep.

38
00:03:26,271 --> 00:03:28,480
Which is why I need
my climbing partner.

39
00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:31,747
Ah, I can't, man.
Even if I wanted to.

40
00:03:31,782 --> 00:03:34,178
The internship
starts on Monday.
You know that.

41
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,587
Oh, yeah. Insurance, right?

42
00:03:36,622 --> 00:03:38,523
It's just temporary.

43
00:03:38,558 --> 00:03:40,525
It's gonna be temporary
for the next 50 years, man,

44
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,724
if you're not careful.

45
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,726
Come on. Term's over.

46
00:03:43,761 --> 00:03:46,091
This is our last
real summer holiday.

47
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,532
Ever.

48
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:49,435
You can worry about next year
next year.

49
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,701
What do you say?

50
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:53,571
Suit and tie...

51
00:03:53,606 --> 00:03:55,738
or ice ax and crampons?

52
00:04:03,814 --> 00:04:07,321
Twenty-two years on this planet,
you still can't tie a tie.

53
00:04:08,852 --> 00:04:11,050
Label's sticking out.
Smarten up.

54
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,756
You've got
a real opportunity here.

55
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:16,220
Fit in.

56
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:17,529
Keep up.

57
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,368
Ah, David.

58
00:04:21,403 --> 00:04:23,128
This is my son, Michael.

59
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,294
All right, son,
how you doing?

60
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:26,703
Give him the tour,
would you?

61
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:30,267
See that?

62
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:31,774
Six grands' worth
of kettle.

63
00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:33,237
Shoes, another bag.

64
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:34,810
Whistle,
three large.

65
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:37,142
See the Porsche outside?
That's mine, innit.

66
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:39,485
I'm walking round this place
with a hundred grand
wrapped round me.

67
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,982
You know how I got it?
On the fucking phones.

68
00:04:43,084 --> 00:04:44,182
This is you.

69
00:04:47,429 --> 00:04:49,957
Now, pick up the phone
and dream big.

70
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:54,632
Carol, where's that latte?

71
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:04,972
I'd love to have
a minute of your time.

72
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,173
Hello.
[dial tone]

73
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:12,848
How we doing, boy?
What we got?

74
00:05:12,883 --> 00:05:15,180
That should have been done
about 1:00.
Yeah, but it's my first day.

75
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:16,786
Don't really care, buddy.
I know.

76
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:18,854
Don't really care.
Fake it till you make it.

77

Mm?

[talking quietly]

83
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:43,582
All right.

[coworker] I do appreciate
you didn't break into
your own house.

92
00:07:05,127 --> 00:07:06,896
Yeah, right, mate. Yeah, yeah.

[people chattering]

00:08:35,184 --> 00:08:37,822
Aaah, Mikey! There he is!

99
00:08:37,857 --> 00:08:39,791
A postcard?

100
00:08:39,826 --> 00:08:42,519
Ah, man, what, you traveled
back in time to get this?

101
00:08:43,764 --> 00:08:46,897
1984. I knew
it would get your attention.

102
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:48,734
[Michael] A text
would have been fine.

103
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:50,230
You ignore
my texts, man.

104
00:08:50,265 --> 00:08:52,870
All right, guys,
a couple of quick intros.

105
00:08:52,905 --> 00:08:56,401
Michael, say hi to Natascha.
Natascha, say hi to Michael.

106
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,073
Hey.
American?

107
00:08:58,779 --> 00:08:59,844
Canadian.
Yep.

'Cause this is Leo,
her boyfriend.

111
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,655
He's a climbing guide.

112
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,087
Alps, Andes,

Not Canadian.

Make a lot more money here
than back home in the Sierra.

[Michael laughs]
Well, Mr. Moneybags...

116
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,099
And this is Rudi.
He's a snowboarder.

117
00:09:24,134 --> 00:09:25,771
He should turn pro
any day now, yeah?

118
00:09:25,806 --> 00:09:28,939
Yeah, and then I can kiss
my day job goodbye.

120

Ah.
Uh-huh.

124
00:09:40,348 --> 00:09:41,754
A review on Tripadvisor

125
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,723
called me "a fucking prick".
[laughing]

126
00:09:43,758 --> 00:09:45,153
A review we can all trust.

127
00:09:45,188 --> 00:09:46,924
Ha, fuck you!

128
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,728
It was my proudest moment.
So what?

129
00:09:49,258 --> 00:09:50,730
Yeah.

130
00:09:50,765 --> 00:09:52,930
All right, brother,
how long have I got you?

131
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:55,460
Five days.
It's the best I could do, man.

132
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,462
Any longer
and I'm out of a job.

133
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,068
All right, finish up,
girls and boys.

134
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:00,971
Let's go climbing.
'Bout time.

135
00:10:01,006 --> 00:10:02,368
[Natascha grunts]
Let's go!

136
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:04,777
Wait. What, what, what, now?
Yeah.

137
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,307
Man, I've just driven 500 miles.
I've hardly slept.

138
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:08,638
What are you, like, 40?

139
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:10,915
We need to get you
acclimatized, man!

140
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,577
Come on.
This is it, Mikey!

141
00:10:14,382 --> 00:10:15,953
Grab your kit, man.

142
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:18,087
We take the telecabin
in 20 minutes, all right?

143
00:10:18,122 --> 00:10:19,957
[Michael] Uh...
Ha ha!

144
00:10:19,992 --> 00:10:22,091
You're in Chamonix, baby!

145
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,357
[Rudi] Climbed anything of note
out here, Michael?

146
00:10:24,392 --> 00:10:26,128
[Michael]
It's my first time in the Alps.

147
00:10:26,163 --> 00:10:29,296
[Rudi] Fledgling, huh?
Guess you must like babysitting.

148
00:10:29,331 --> 00:10:31,397
Ah, Michael
can handle himself.

149
00:10:31,432 --> 00:10:33,839
He put up a new route
on the Orion Face.

150
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:35,940
Orion Face?
Never heard of it.

151
00:10:35,975 --> 00:10:37,172
It's on Ben Nevis.

152
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:40,780
I did Scotland once.
Never again.

153
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:42,848
Who the hell climbs
in weather like that?

154
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:45,917
Yeah, well,
any fool can climb
when the sun's out.

155
00:10:45,952 --> 00:10:47,182
We'll see.

156
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,793
[Michael]
I can feel the altitude.

157
00:10:53,828 --> 00:10:55,619
[laughs]
I mean, come on.

158
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:58,732
You just ascended
a third of Mount Everest
in 20 minutes.

159
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:01,999
Push through, man.
Couple of days,
you won't even notice it.

160
00:11:02,034 --> 00:11:03,033
[grunts]

161
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:11,338
Ah,<i> au revoir,</i>
motherfuckers!

00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:12,636
Yee-hoo!
Be safe.

163
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,374
<i>Au revoir.</i>
<i>Tres bien.</i>

164
00:11:19,183 --> 00:11:20,952
Hey! Isa.

165
00:11:20,987 --> 00:11:23,251
[speaking French]

166
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:30,027
Hey, Michael,
this is Isabelle.
She's one of us.

167
00:11:30,062 --> 00:11:31,523
Not much of a climber, though.

168
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,195
And you're not much of a skier.

169
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,966
Ooh.
[kissing noises]

170
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:36,660
[kissing noise]
[JP chuckles]

171
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,497
[speaking French]

172
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:39,729
First day?

173
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:41,236
Yeah. [pants]
[Isabelle laughs]

174
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,501
I can see that.

175
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,140
[Michael, Isabelle laugh]

176
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:45,944
He's used to climbing molehills
in Scotland.

177
00:11:45,979 --> 00:11:47,638
[scoffs] And Wales.

178
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,640
And Wales.
Yeah, he's just finding out

179
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,049
what thin air tastes like,
that's all.

180
00:11:52,084 --> 00:11:54,579
[speaking French]

181
00:11:56,451 --> 00:11:59,320
We're gonna see
how the Englishman copes
at altitude.

182
00:11:59,355 --> 00:12:00,717
[laughs]

183
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:03,687
All righty.
Well, good luck and be safe.

184
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,260
[Leo] You too.
[Michael] Thanks.

185
00:12:05,295 --> 00:12:07,559
[speaking French]

186
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:08,769
[speaking French]

187
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:36,390
Hey, this is slow, Michael.
Even for you. Come on.

188
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:40,130
I haven't acclimatized yet.
Gimme a break.

189
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:43,870
[chuckles]

190
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:55,574
[JP] Don't get used to
these baby rocks, Michael.

191
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,543
You won't find them
on the Matterhorn.

192
00:12:57,578 --> 00:12:59,281
[Michael] Shit.
Well, I'd better go home then.

193
00:12:59,316 --> 00:13:01,811
[JP] Too late, baby!
I got you now.

194
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:03,747
Whoo-hoo! [echoes]

195
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,860
[Natascha] Hey, honey,
JP's climbing faster than you.

196
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:11,227
If he tries to pass you,
push him off.

197
00:13:11,262 --> 00:13:12,965
I'll say it was an accident.

198
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:29,212
All right, let's go.

199
00:13:30,182 --> 00:13:31,775
Hey, Michael,

200
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,381
look beneath your feet, man!

201
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:35,680
Yee-hoo-hoo!

202
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:38,155
[JP] Wait, wait, wait, wait!

203
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,620
[shutter clicks]
Yeah!

204
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,963
That's a keeper, my friend.

205
00:13:44,966 --> 00:13:46,823
You don't wanna wait
for JP and Michael?

206
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:49,298
I need a beer.
[laughs]

207
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,498
There's no bar up here
last I checked.

208
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,435
They'll catch up.
Okay.

209
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,866
Well, age before beauty.

210
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:58,637
Mwah.
[laughs]

211
00:14:14,358 --> 00:14:17,392
Come on, Mikey.
Last few steps. Almost there.

212
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:21,099
Heh heh, yeah!

213
00:14:21,134 --> 00:14:22,298
[sighs]

214
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:24,102
Yeah.

215
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:26,830
Whoo-hoo!
[chuckles]

216
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:32,506
Welcome to the asylum
above 4,000 meters! [echoes]

217
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,947
You nutter, huh?

218
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,916
Worth bleeding for?

219
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:39,546
[JP] That's the altitude, man.
[Michael laughs]

220
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:40,844
Worth bleeding for.

221
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,681
Yeah.
[grunts]

222
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,749
[Michael] This is only
the beginning, mate.

223
00:14:50,955 --> 00:14:53,032
Come on. We're gonna miss
the last lift.

224
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:54,792
Ah, we'll make it!

225
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,200
Yeah, you might.

226
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:57,861
He looks fried.

227
00:14:57,896 --> 00:14:59,929
[Michael] Well, I made it
to the top, didn't I?

228
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:02,503
Yeah, and it
beat the crap out of you
in the process.

229
00:15:02,538 --> 00:15:04,274
The Dent's a training climb.

230
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:07,508
There's no skills required,
just big fat ropes.

231
00:15:07,543 --> 00:15:10,379
Did you shit yourself while you
were up there, Michael?
You need a fresh diaper?

232
00:15:10,414 --> 00:15:13,580
No, I already went.
I'll save you one
for the Matterhorn.

233
00:15:13,615 --> 00:15:17,056
I love a good
dick-measuring contest.
I'll just get mine out.

234
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:18,948
Ugh, please don't.
[JP laughs]

235
00:15:18,983 --> 00:15:21,687
And you can put yours back in
your pants for now, Leo, okay?

236
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:22,963
[Leo] Okay, okay.

237
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,923
Hey, don't worry
about him.

238
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,861
The locals take a while
to warm up. That's all.

239
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,731
He's about as local as I am.

240
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,469
Well, he's not French.

241
00:15:34,504 --> 00:15:36,240
But this is Chamonix.

242
00:15:36,275 --> 00:15:39,144
The only way to be one
is to put in the time.

243
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:40,211
He's earned it.

244
00:15:48,683 --> 00:15:50,947
Oh, right.
Thank you, Laura.

245
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,588
[chattering]

246

[speaking French]

247
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,662
Mmm.

248
00:16:03,665 --> 00:16:04,532
[laughs]

249
00:16:13,576 --> 00:16:14,905
[both laughing]

250
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,247
Ah, man.

251
00:16:16,282 --> 00:16:17,875
Who was that?

252
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,515
Mm. A client.

253
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,947
Like, just because
I laugh at
one of his jokes,

254
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:26,015
he thinks
it's a come on.

255
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,127
I would.
I know you would,

256
00:16:28,162 --> 00:16:29,194
you little pig.

257
00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:31,493
[laughs]
Oh, ho ho! Okay.

258
00:16:31,528 --> 00:16:33,231
<i>Salut,</i> Michael.
<i>Salut.</i>

260
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,534
<i>Merci.</i>

261
00:16:40,372 --> 00:16:42,207
<i>Santé.</i>
<i>Santé. Santé.</i>

262
00:16:49,381 --> 00:16:51,084
So, what are we doing tomorrow?

263
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:52,580
I'm working tomorrow.

264
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:54,813
Leo's guiding. Uh... Oh.

265
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,221
What about you, Isa?

266
00:16:56,784 --> 00:16:58,014
What?

267
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:00,258
I'm doing nothing. Why? [laughs]

268
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:03,459
Why don't you take
Michael skiing, hmm?

269
00:17:03,494 --> 00:17:05,824
He should get
into the glacier
every chance he gets.

270
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,332
I need him acclimatized
for the Matterhorn.

271
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:12,369
Do you ski well?
Well, you're not gonna have to
babysit me or anything.

272
00:17:12,404 --> 00:17:14,536
I won't. Keep up.

273
00:17:16,672 --> 00:17:18,936
Ooh... [laughs]
[Isabelle laughs]

274
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:16,301
Okay.

275
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,605
Okay, yes.

276
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:28,005
[motor whirring]

277

[sighs]

279
00:18:39,524 --> 00:18:41,425
Hello.

280
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,954
Mm.
Is that a Super 8?

281
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:43,988
Yeah.

282
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:45,858
Late '70s model.

283
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:47,893
[Isabelle]
I just love the images.

284
00:18:47,928 --> 00:18:49,499
Soft and imperfect.

285
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,337
There is no romance
with digital.

286
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,208
You want to have a try?
Sure.

287
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,474
You just have to squeeze
the trigger there

288
00:18:57,509 --> 00:18:59,069
and you're rolling.
Okay.

289
00:19:01,777 --> 00:19:03,139
[motor whirring]
Hello!

290
00:19:03,174 --> 00:19:04,712
Me?
Yes, you.

291
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,516
I'm camera shy.

292
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:07,781
I don't know what to do.

293
00:19:07,816 --> 00:19:09,046
[Michael]
Oh, are you now?

294
00:19:10,522 --> 00:19:11,818
I am.

295
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:14,260
Mm. [laughs]

296
00:19:16,528 --> 00:19:18,759
So, what's the deal
with you and Jean Pierre?

297
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,333
Are you like, uh...

298
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,799
Like?
You know, dating or...

299
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:27,999
[laughs]

300
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,804
Well, we're good friends.

301
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:33,136
He's like a brother
to me now, you know.

302
00:19:35,415 --> 00:19:37,206
What do you mean now?
[laughs]

303
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:39,208
You have so many questions!

304
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:40,550
I-- Uh--

305
00:19:40,585 --> 00:19:43,146
Well, yeah,
we've been dating.

306
00:19:43,885 --> 00:19:45,951
Like two or three years ago.

307
00:19:45,986 --> 00:19:48,954
And, actually,
he was my first love.

308
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:50,230
Right.

309
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,056
Why?

310
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,563
Are you jealous, Michael?

311
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,269
Course not.

312
00:19:58,262 --> 00:19:59,338
Liar.

Jesus.

316
00:20:46,585 --> 00:20:50,114
Poor bastards.
[Isabelle] Come August,

317
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,622
they'll be dying
almost every day out here.

320
00:21:22,456 --> 00:21:23,785
Nice one.

321
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,085
[sighs] Yeah, man.

322
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,461
[exhales]
The face is pretty loose.

323
00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:32,893
Yeah. It will settle.

324
00:21:32,928 --> 00:21:34,862
Plenty of good ice
further up the route.

325
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,476
[Michael whistles]
He's fast!

326
00:21:45,677 --> 00:21:47,105
Definitely better than us.

327
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,272
Yeah, he's in
a different league.

328
00:21:50,374 --> 00:21:53,353
[speaking French]

329
00:21:55,852 --> 00:21:57,115
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

330
00:22:00,384 --> 00:22:03,352
Man, that's Damien Roux.
The guy's a movie star here.

331
00:22:03,387 --> 00:22:04,661
Yeah, he's pretty insane.

332
00:22:04,696 --> 00:22:06,498
Oh, man, look at that!

333
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,566
That's climbing.
All right.

334
00:22:10,064 --> 00:22:11,261
I'll take the next pitch.

335
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,900
You sure?
Yeah!

336
00:22:12,935 --> 00:22:14,803
All right.
But don't hang about.

337
00:22:14,838 --> 00:22:17,674
I wanna be on the summit
long before sunset, okay?

338
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,309
[blows]

339
00:22:26,784 --> 00:22:28,080
[laughs]

340
00:22:29,688 --> 00:22:30,819
[blows]

341
00:22:31,624 --> 00:22:32,557
Agh!

342
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:02,279
[JP] Yeah, we made it, man!

343
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,018
[JP laughs] Yep.

344
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,384
[sighs]

345
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:10,188
Whoo! Well done.

346
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,321
[exhales]

347
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:20,506
Whoo-hoo!

348
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:21,573
Yes!

349
00:23:23,071 --> 00:23:24,400
[sighs]

350
00:23:24,435 --> 00:23:25,907
[breathing heavily]

351
00:23:28,813 --> 00:23:31,077
Lucy would love this.

352
00:23:31,112 --> 00:23:32,650
Your sister could have led that

353
00:23:32,685 --> 00:23:34,751
with one hand
tied behind her back, man.

354
00:23:34,786 --> 00:23:36,115
Yeah.

355
00:23:37,723 --> 00:23:40,119
This should have been
her mountain.

356
00:23:40,154 --> 00:23:42,451
Why do you think
I sent the postcard, eh?

357
00:23:42,486 --> 00:23:43,386
[laughs]

358
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,530
Oh, okay.

359
00:23:49,603 --> 00:23:51,504
I'm gutted she never
made it out here.

360
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,836
But you did.

361
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:55,475
That counts for something.

362
00:23:56,973 --> 00:23:58,005
Yeah.

363
00:23:58,942 --> 00:23:59,974
Yep.

364
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:03,978
You want a picture?

365
00:24:04,618 --> 00:24:06,046
No.

366
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:07,487
This is enough.

367
00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:09,588
Hell yeah.

368
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:24,163
[JP] Leo reckons
the weather's breaking
for the Eiger.

369
00:24:24,198 --> 00:24:27,001
There's gonna be
a window in the next
couple of days, man.

370
00:24:27,036 --> 00:24:28,904
[Michael] Don't start.
You just climbed

371
00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:30,367
the north face
of the Matterhorn.

372
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,138
You can do this.
[handbrake clicks]

373
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,174
I'm so tempted.

374
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:37,242
Stay one more day
at least.

375
00:24:37,277 --> 00:24:39,717
You know, we're heading
to the Valley Noir
in Italy tomorrow.

376
00:24:39,752 --> 00:24:42,016
Yeah.
It's kind of
a tradition we have

377
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:43,688
to mark
the summer solstice.

378
00:24:43,723 --> 00:24:45,591
I know. You've said.

379
00:24:45,626 --> 00:24:47,824
And it's the last chance
to ski the glacier.

380
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:49,595
I've skied the glacier.

381
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,696
Not like this, my friend.
Not like this.

382
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:57,493
Look, I'd love to,
but I've gotta go.

383
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:04,742
I can't miss that ferry.

384
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:06,546
Yeah.

385
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:09,846
She likes you I think.

386
00:25:09,881 --> 00:25:12,211
Who?
You know who.

387
00:25:12,246 --> 00:25:15,115
We went skiing, Jean Pierre,
that's all.

388
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,381
Chamonix gossips, my friend.
We went skiing!

389
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,350
Chamonix gossips! [laughs]
We went skiing!

390
00:25:23,587 --> 00:25:25,125
[PA announcement]

391
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,193
[Leo ] Ooh, it's baking
down here now.

392
00:25:27,228 --> 00:25:29,701
Yeah.
Must be 80/85.

393
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,901
Gotta stop talking
in Fahrenheit.
No one understands!

394
00:25:31,936 --> 00:25:33,804
Yes, please, sir.
[laughing]

395
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,003
And feet.

396
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:36,400
Why do you
use feet, bro?

397
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:37,709
Yep.
I don't get it.

398
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,238
Meters and Celsius,
honey.

399
00:25:39,273 --> 00:25:41,042
Okay, it's fucking hot, man.
[JP] Better.

400
00:25:41,077 --> 00:25:42,615
But it's still cool up high.

401
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,650
That's what matters.
<i>Oui.</i>

402
00:25:44,685 --> 00:25:45,684
Yo!

403
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,622
[JP] Hey, Mikey! There he is!

404
00:25:49,657 --> 00:25:50,887
[Michael] You good?
[Rudi]<i> Ca va?</i>

405
00:25:50,922 --> 00:25:51,789
Aha!

406
00:25:53,892 --> 00:25:55,089
What about your job?

407
00:25:55,124 --> 00:25:56,255
Ah, I'll get fired.

408
00:25:56,895 --> 00:25:58,191
What about your father?

409
00:25:58,226 --> 00:26:00,556
Well, he told me
to follow my dreams.

410
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:02,294
Whoa, he actually said that?

411
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:04,230
No, he called me
a cunt and hung up.

412
00:26:04,265 --> 00:26:08,498
Ah. [laughs]. Well, life's
not over yet my friend.

413
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,599
You're surfing. Hm?

414
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:11,743
Yo!

415
00:26:13,813 --> 00:26:15,142
You coming up?

416
00:26:15,177 --> 00:26:16,748
Ah, no,
I didn't bring any skis.

417
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,013
I just came to say hi.

418
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:19,443
No way, man.

419
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:21,445
You can't miss this ride.
[laughing]

420
00:26:22,756 --> 00:26:24,954
You brought a spare pair?
[laughs]

421
00:26:24,989 --> 00:26:27,418
Thanks, man.
You haven't seen
what we're skiing yet.

422
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:28,925
Exactly! [laughing]

423
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,795
I'm ready. Whoo!
<i>On y va.</i>

424
00:26:36,627 --> 00:26:38,429
<i>A ce soir.</i>

425
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,167
Whoo-hoo!

426
00:26:44,877 --> 00:26:46,206
Michael!

427
00:26:47,143 --> 00:26:49,011
<i>Ca va?</i> [laughs]

428
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:53,477
Whoo!

429
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,790
Whoo-hoo!

430
00:27:01,355 --> 00:27:02,992
[Isabelle]<i> Allez!</i> [laughs]

431
00:27:03,027 --> 00:27:04,356
Whoo-hoo!

432
00:27:10,804 --> 00:27:12,067
[Isabelle] Come on, Michael!

433
00:27:12,102 --> 00:27:13,101
Oh, shit!

434
00:27:15,336 --> 00:27:16,599
Shit!

435
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:19,877
Oh, shit!

436
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:31,482
[breathing heavily]

437
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:33,154
Oh, fuck.

438
00:28:01,382 --> 00:28:02,414
[Leo] Michael!

439
00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:07,859
You made a left
through the ice tunnel?

440
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,224
Isabelle told me.
That's fucking nuts, man!

441
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:12,358
Yeah, it was
a wrong turn.
No, no, no.

442
00:28:12,393 --> 00:28:16,032
It's only a wrong turn if you
don't make it out, right?

443
00:28:17,035 --> 00:28:18,661
Did you hear about this?

444
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,905
He was skiing like he was
Roger Moore or some shit.

445
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,007
[laughs]
Heard he went full-on
<i>View to a Kill</i> up there.

446
00:28:24,042 --> 00:28:27,340
Almost like
he's one of our own.
Aw, Leo.

447
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:29,848
Anybody who climbs
the north face of
the Matterhorn in one day

448
00:28:29,883 --> 00:28:31,476
gets my vote.
[laughs]

449
00:28:31,511 --> 00:28:34,050
Well, it was
pretty messy, okay?

450
00:28:34,085 --> 00:28:35,447
It can be messy.

451
00:28:35,482 --> 00:28:37,482
It's a big fucking tick, man.

452
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:40,188
And that's all you're getting.

453
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,554
I'll take it. [laughs]

454
00:28:46,361 --> 00:28:48,559
I bet that was hard
for him.

455
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:52,167
Well, he sees a lot
of fresh faces come up
to Chamonix, Michael.

456
00:28:52,202 --> 00:28:53,630
All gear and no idea.

457
00:28:54,765 --> 00:28:56,006
You can't
just expect him

458
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:57,843
to welcome you in
with open arms.

459
00:28:57,878 --> 00:28:59,306
Yeah.
Gotta earn that.

460
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,606
[whispers]
I think you just did.

461
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:04,212
Really?
Mm-hmm.

462
00:29:04,247 --> 00:29:05,708
Yeah.

463
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:08,381
Oh, we all love you,
Michael.

464
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:12,517
But I don't think
I'm the girl you should be
talking to right now.

465
00:29:14,257 --> 00:29:15,795
Go get 'em, tiger.

466
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:25,464
Hello.

467
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:29,765
You look, uh,
you look good tonight.

468
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:32,042
Only tonight?

469
00:29:32,077 --> 00:29:34,110
N-- Not just tonight.

470
00:29:34,145 --> 00:29:37,245
I'm sorry, I've, uh,
I've had a few beers. [laughs]

471
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,215
Wow, you really know
how to make a girl feel special.

472
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,810
No, come on.
That's not what I meant.

473
00:29:41,845 --> 00:29:44,285
You know what I meant.
So what did you mean?

474
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,991
Well, I said it before,
that you look--

475
00:29:47,961 --> 00:29:49,961
you look beautiful.

476
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:53,591
You got anything else
than I'm beautiful?

477
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:54,823
[laughs]

478
00:29:54,858 --> 00:29:56,231
It's a bit lousy.
Okay.

479
00:29:56,266 --> 00:29:57,628
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

480
00:29:57,663 --> 00:30:00,268
Uh... Mm...

481
00:30:00,303 --> 00:30:02,666
It was really special
skiing with you today.

482
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:06,472
And what was so special
about skiing with me?

483
00:30:08,047 --> 00:30:09,211
The chase.

484
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,579
And what do you plan to do
if you got me?

485
00:30:16,517 --> 00:30:17,549
Hmm?

486
00:30:19,388 --> 00:30:21,091

[thunder rumbling]

488
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:28,791
So, why did you come back?

489
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:34,599
Well, 'cause I wanted to climb
and help JP realize his dream.

490
00:30:34,634 --> 00:30:36,876
Mm. That's the only reason
you stayed?

491
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,241
Well, it's not the only reason.

492
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:42,013
So?

493
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,674
Are you really gonna
make me say it?

494
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,643
Yeah.
[laughs]

495
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:47,381
Because I wanted to see you.

496
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:52,419
And I thought that maybe...

497

Mm...

501
00:31:29,425 --> 00:31:30,655
Good morning.

502
00:31:31,955 --> 00:31:33,658
Did you sleep well?

503
00:31:33,693 --> 00:31:35,693
Mmm...

504
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:37,266
Mmm...

505
00:31:40,469 --> 00:31:43,371
[groans] I'm going for a swim.

506
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:47,573
Isn't it a bit cold?

507
00:31:47,608 --> 00:31:48,772
No.

508
00:31:52,514 --> 00:31:53,744
Ooh la la!

509
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:02,456
It's good!

510
00:32:02,491 --> 00:32:03,391
Yeah?

Hey...
Hey!

514
00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:57,247
[laughs] So we're
holding hands now?

515
00:32:57,282 --> 00:32:59,546
Ah. You can let go
anytime.

[church bell peals]

518
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:08,016
Then put it through the till
like any other bar beer.

519
00:33:08,051 --> 00:33:10,623
That's pretty much it.
Got it.

520
00:33:10,658 --> 00:33:13,164
It's a boring job
but pays enough to get
up to the glacier.

521
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,023
That's all that
really matters, right?

522
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:16,761
[chuckles] Yep.

[Michael chattering]

524
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,902
[JP] There he is!
With a whole new career.

525
00:33:27,345 --> 00:33:29,378
How did it go,
lover boy?

526
00:33:29,413 --> 00:33:31,908
[laughs] All right,
you don't have to
say a word.

527
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,580
How's working with Béa?

528
00:33:33,615 --> 00:33:35,978
Yeah, she's cool.
Yeah, she's cool, man.

529
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:38,156
She's playing the same game
as the rest of us.

530
00:33:38,191 --> 00:33:40,686
Just waiting to become
the next big thing.

531
00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:43,018
How good is she?

532
00:33:43,053 --> 00:33:46,296
Man, she was hot
for a little while.

533
00:33:46,331 --> 00:33:48,397
Then her sponsor
got a crush on someone new.

534
00:33:48,432 --> 00:33:50,267
Someone crazier.

535
00:33:50,302 --> 00:33:53,336
She's gotta up her game though.
Bust some big-ass routes.

536
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,669
Just like you,
right?

537
00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:58,242
Ah, Mikey, Mikey.

538
00:33:58,277 --> 00:34:00,508
You know, if you stay
in your comfort zone,

539
00:34:00,543 --> 00:34:03,775
you'll stay here
behind this shitty bar
for the rest of your life.

540
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:06,118
Come on.
You know,
this life-and-death business

541
00:34:06,153 --> 00:34:07,944
is very fickle.

542
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:12,388
It's Damien Roux.
Hey, turn this up, would you?

[patrons cheering]

00:34:56,632 --> 00:34:57,796
[JP] Yes.

[music continues]

551

Harder ground's
not stopping him.

552
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,104
He'll need to slow down
on the crux pitch.

553
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:43,479
There's no shortcuts.

This guy is nuts.

Wait, lemme see.

559
00:36:17,284 --> 00:36:19,174
Wait.
Lemme see!

Turn the music off now!

00:37:15,265 --> 00:37:18,233
Turn the goddamn
fucking music off!

come up there, asshole!

and then...

I feel

it was a freak show

bigger, bolder, scarier routes.

That's what
we all came to see, Leo.

They pushed him too hard, man.

You saw those slick moves
and the flashy touches.

That's showboating.
No.

Damien is a legend.
One of a kind.

Yeah, you keep telling
a man that, he'll start
to believe you.

Cold snap's kicked out

on the Bernese Oberland.

Yeah? She's in condition?

you're gonna get right now.

If you want it perfect,
wait till November.

Let's do this!

Michael?

604
00:39:06,145 --> 00:39:08,046
We took 16 hours
on the Matterhorn.

605
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:11,181
We could have done it in ten.
The Eiger's twice the size.

606
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:14,052
You heard what he just said.
We might not get another chance.

607
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:17,561
That's a risk that could end
in disappointment,
not-- not death, JP.

[sighs]

609
00:39:20,423 --> 00:39:22,060
This is not about the Eiger.

610
00:39:22,095 --> 00:39:24,194
It's about Damien Roux.

611
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:26,196
You know why he's dead, Michael?

612
00:39:27,067 --> 00:39:28,297
'Cause free solo climbers

613

That's just
a cold, hard fact of life.

615
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:34,710
No ropes,
no partner.

616
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,042
Just a matter of time.

617
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:42,487
Me? I'd like to get
back to some good,
old-fashioned mountaineering.

618
00:39:42,522 --> 00:39:44,720
Put yesterday behind us.
Thank you.

[Leo] Yo.

620

That's what separates
him and us.

621
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:55,423
And I'll be at the end
of that rope,

00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:57,359
babysitting you as always.

623
00:39:57,394 --> 00:39:59,196
And just remember, Michael,

624
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:01,737
yes or no is the right answer.

625
00:40:01,772 --> 00:40:04,201
I won't climb with you
on a maybe.

626
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:06,940
You make your decision,
we'll back you either way.

[laughs]
And how is your room service?

633
00:40:31,065 --> 00:40:32,328
You're looking at it.

634
00:40:32,935 --> 00:40:34,506
Mm, cup of tea?

635
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:36,838
[laughs] No, no, no,
I don't drink tea.

I'm not one of
your English girls, Michael.

00:40:40,173 --> 00:40:41,304
[laughs] Okay.

Mm. In the backpack.

Mm-hmm-hmm.
Let's have a look.

<i>Oh, putain.</i>

645
00:41:01,733 --> 00:41:04,327
That's a strong look.

646
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:06,901

She's very pretty.

00:41:12,975 --> 00:41:14,304
Should I be jealous?

650
00:41:15,648 --> 00:41:17,681
That's Lucy, my sister.

651
00:41:18,178 --> 00:41:19,210
Mmm.

652
00:41:22,116 --> 00:41:24,215
You do look a bit alike.

653
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,349
Same big, bright eyes.

654
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,158
Did I say something wrong?

655
00:41:34,964 --> 00:41:35,996
[chuckles]

656
00:41:36,669 --> 00:41:38,801
Uh, nothing.

657
00:41:41,564 --> 00:41:42,937
She's not with us anymore.

658
00:41:44,941 --> 00:41:47,271
Okay. I'm so sorry.

659
00:41:47,306 --> 00:41:49,944
If you want, we can
talk about something else.

660
00:41:49,979 --> 00:41:51,143
It's okay.

661
00:41:51,915 --> 00:41:53,343
Uh, I don't mind.

662
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:55,048
Are you sure?

663
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:58,150
Usually, uh, I can't stand
talking about her.

664
00:41:58,185 --> 00:42:00,251
I can barely even think
about her without...

665
00:42:04,829 --> 00:42:07,929
But out here, it's strange.

666
00:42:09,933 --> 00:42:11,867
It's like she's with us.

667
00:42:11,902 --> 00:42:14,298
I know it sounds silly.
No, it's not.

668
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:16,531
So, she was a climber too?
Yeah.

669
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,467
A good one.

670
00:42:23,606 --> 00:42:25,078
When my mum died,

671
00:42:25,883 --> 00:42:27,344
my dad...

672
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:29,577
kinda went off
the deep end.

673
00:42:29,612 --> 00:42:33,592
He was pretty horrible
to be around.

674
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:36,056
Still is.

675
00:42:37,026 --> 00:42:39,521
Her solution was
to take us climbing.

676
00:42:39,556 --> 00:42:41,325
So, she got you hooked.

677
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,700
She did.

678
00:42:43,736 --> 00:42:45,065
When you climb,

679
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:47,397
it's like...

680
00:42:48,598 --> 00:42:50,367
nothing else exits.

681
00:42:51,942 --> 00:42:55,878
You know, there's no room
for bullshit, grief, pain.

682
00:42:55,913 --> 00:42:57,506
Only the present.

683
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:58,914
The next move.

684
00:43:00,643 --> 00:43:02,885
And what happened to her?

685
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,891
We were on a climb in Scotland,
and the weather turned.

686
00:43:08,926 --> 00:43:10,794
Total whiteout.

687
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:12,664
It-- It was-- It was scary.

688
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,458
When we got back
to the car park,

689
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:19,968
we were so buzzed
that we'd made it back
that we had a couple of beers.

690
00:43:20,003 --> 00:43:21,167
Just a couple.

691
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,532
Take the edge off, you know.

692
00:43:24,777 --> 00:43:26,777
She was in such a rush
to get home.

693
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:28,977
She wanted to drive.

694
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:33,575
I just had this... feeling.

695
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:36,149
Like something bad
was gonna happen.

696
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:42,452
And I did nothing.

697
00:44:14,794 --> 00:44:17,157
[rumbling]

698
00:44:22,901 --> 00:44:25,132
Michael, get down!

699
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:30,874
Ah, fuck!

700
00:44:34,814 --> 00:44:36,209
[rumbling]

701
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:42,446
Fuck.

702
00:44:44,923 --> 00:44:46,582
[rumbling continues]

703
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,618
Michael! You all right?

704
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,356
Yeah. [panting]

705
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,745
[ice cracking loudly]

706
00:45:08,276 --> 00:45:10,012
Hey, hey, get in!

707
00:45:10,047 --> 00:45:11,673
[grunting]

708
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:29,801
[grunts]

709
00:45:31,068 --> 00:45:33,266
Whoa. [exhales]

710
00:45:33,301 --> 00:45:35,235
The face is falling
to fucking bits.

711
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:38,733
The sun is warming up the face,
melting the ice.

712
00:45:38,768 --> 00:45:41,109
All that compacted rock's
come loose.

713
00:45:41,144 --> 00:45:44,343
We need to stop climbing now.
Bivvy at the Swallow's Nest.

714
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:47,412
[Michael]
See how it is tomorrow.

715
00:45:47,447 --> 00:45:50,481
[wind howling]

716
00:45:57,556 --> 00:46:00,392
[Natascha] Oh, my God.
All right now, you got this.

717
00:46:00,427 --> 00:46:01,492
Just get to me.

718
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:04,396
All right, honey,
I'm right here.

719
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:06,134
I'm right here.
[Natascha grunts]

720
00:46:06,169 --> 00:46:07,729
Okay.
Quick as you can.

721
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:09,071
[rumbling]

722
00:46:09,106 --> 00:46:11,106
[shouts]
[Leo] Hey!

723
00:46:11,141 --> 00:46:12,910
Hey, honey...
[grunts]

724
00:46:14,144 --> 00:46:16,276
All  right, get to me.

725
00:46:16,311 --> 00:46:18,278
[Natascha grunting]

726
00:46:18,313 --> 00:46:20,775
[Leo grunts] I got you!
Right, recover!

727
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:22,348
[Natascha grunts, gasps]

728
00:46:23,516 --> 00:46:24,746
[groans]

729
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:27,353
Gimme some slack! [grunts]

730
00:46:29,852 --> 00:46:30,994
Come on.
Okay.

731
00:46:31,029 --> 00:46:32,061
All right.

732
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:35,790
[whimpers]

733
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:37,935
Oh, my God!
That was close.

734
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:39,266
I'm sorry for freaking out.

735
00:46:39,835 --> 00:46:41,873
No, no, it's crazy.
It's still coming.

736
00:46:43,305 --> 00:46:46,339
[wind whistling]

737
00:47:00,157 --> 00:47:01,860
[Leo on radio]
<i>JP, Michael, come in.</i>

738
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:04,027
[radio bleeps]
Yep, Leo.

739
00:47:04,062 --> 00:47:06,458
How are you two doing?
<i>We're at Death Bivvy,</i>

740
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:08,493
about to turn in
for the night. You?

741
00:47:08,528 --> 00:47:10,363
We're at Swallow's Nest.

742
00:47:10,398 --> 00:47:12,629
Could've gotten further,
but there's a lot of rockfall,

743
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:14,697
and we don't need to push it
right now.

744
00:47:14,732 --> 00:47:16,534
Yeah, it gets worse higher up.

745
00:47:16,569 --> 00:47:18,602
It's too warm,
there's not enough ice.

746
00:47:18,637 --> 00:47:20,307
<i>It's choppy as fuck.</i>

747
00:47:20,342 --> 00:47:22,606
Yeah, but should be fine
if we get moving early enough.

748
00:47:22,641 --> 00:47:25,279
It's your call, Leo.
What are you thinking?

749
00:47:25,314 --> 00:47:28,612
<i>I mean, Natascha and I</i>
<i>are above all the problems now.</i>

750
00:47:28,647 --> 00:47:31,813
We should be able to summit
pretty easily tomorrow.

751
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:34,156
You guys still got all that
bad shit in front of ya.

752
00:47:34,191 --> 00:47:37,753
Do you suggest a retreat?
Over.

753
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,723
Come on, man,
he isn't saying that.
What the fuck?

754
00:47:40,758 --> 00:47:44,001
If you wanna go for the summit,
you gotta keep your foot down.

755
00:47:44,036 --> 00:47:46,729
Hit the face
before the sun comes up.

756
00:47:46,764 --> 00:47:49,666
Exactly what we're
planning to do, Leo.

757
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:54,077
What are you doing?
It's a fucking blitzkrieg
on the ice fields.

758
00:47:54,112 --> 00:47:56,310
Get them off the damn thing.

759
00:47:56,345 --> 00:47:59,984
Hey, guys, you're still
close enough to Railway Tunnel.

760
00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:01,678
You might wanna consider
a retreat

761
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:03,647
<i>while you're still</i>
<i>in a position to do so.</i>

762
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:11,226
Fine, yes, we will.

763
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:13,096
Stay safe.

764
00:48:13,998 --> 00:48:17,067
[Leo]<i> Always.</i>
<i>We'll meet you in</i>
<i>Kleine Scheidegg tomorrow night</i>

765
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:19,102
<i>for a beer</i>
<i>no matter what you decide.</i>

766
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:22,270
Sure thing,
sure thing. Out.

767
00:48:22,305 --> 00:48:23,304
[radio bleeps]

768
00:48:25,275 --> 00:48:26,703
It's gotta be their choice.

769
00:48:28,971 --> 00:48:30,806
Do you think
they'll turn back?

770
00:48:31,644 --> 00:48:32,775
Did we?

771
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,002
A lot colder than yesterday.
[Michael] Yeah.

772
00:48:52,236 --> 00:48:53,961
Face looks pretty good.
Yeah.

773
00:48:53,996 --> 00:48:57,008
[clears throat]
So, up or down?

774
00:48:57,043 --> 00:48:58,768
[exhales]

775
00:49:01,179 --> 00:49:02,904
I don't know, man.

776
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:04,477
Ah...

777
00:49:04,512 --> 00:49:06,479
Couple hours and we
could be having breakfast

778
00:49:06,514 --> 00:49:08,316
with the best view
in Switzerland.

779
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,483
Eggs, bacon, coffee.

780
00:49:10,518 --> 00:49:15,125
Come on, man.
I didn't come this far
to eat eggs and fucking bacon!

781
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,985
Now, come on,
at least let's try
a couple more pitches.

782
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,855
See how it plays out.
[exhales]

783
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:21,791
[JP] So...

784
00:49:22,365 --> 00:49:23,826
up or down?

785
00:49:28,371 --> 00:49:29,931
More like it.

786
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:32,307

[grunts, pants]

788
00:49:39,514 --> 00:49:41,448
It looks loose.

789
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:43,813
Not so bad.

790
00:49:44,783 --> 00:49:45,848
Small steps.

791
00:49:58,302 --> 00:50:00,401
All right. Come on.
Come across, man.

Come on, come on, come on!

Did you call
Mountain Rescue?

They're sending a party on foot

We follow the ridge
to the summit

and then we get
to the Vallot Hut

One of us has a broken arm.

You dropped a rock the size
of a house on us.
