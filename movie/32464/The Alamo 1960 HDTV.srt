1
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:12,285
General Houston's
arrived, gentlemen.

2
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:13,382
Refreshments?

3
00:03:13,482 --> 00:03:15,477
Thank you, Doc.

4
00:03:17,911 --> 00:03:20,661
71 cold, windy,
rump-bumping miles...

5
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,922
...since yesterday.

6
00:03:22,021 --> 00:03:25,837
You wouldn't have it
any other way, Lightfoot.

7
00:03:42,492 --> 00:03:45,046
Company, stand to.

8
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,874
Attention.

9
00:03:49,954 --> 00:03:51,949
As you are.

10
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,449
¡Don Esparza.
- ¡Mi general.

11
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,353
General Houston, may l
order the men to bivouac?

12
00:03:58,453 --> 00:04:00,737
The forced marches
took it out of them.

13
00:04:00,837 --> 00:04:01,865
Foot soldiers may.

14
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:04,419
Feed the others, care
for their horses,

15
00:04:04,518 --> 00:04:07,531
and tell them there'll be
another march within the hour.

16
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:09,287
Yes, sir. Sergeant.

17
00:04:09,387 --> 00:04:10,883
Doctor.
- Sam.

18
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:12,758
Dickinson.
- General, sir.

19
00:04:12,858 --> 00:04:15,304
General, it ain't
none of my business,

20
00:04:15,404 --> 00:04:17,587
but you ain't ate since yesterday.

21
00:04:17,686 --> 00:04:19,861
l'll sit it on the table here.

22
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:21,956
Where's Jim Bowie?

23
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:27,039
When certain people ain't ate,
they're meaner than a bobcat.

24
00:04:30,655 --> 00:04:32,650
Mr Dickinson...

25
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,442
...l asked you a question.

26
00:04:38,676 --> 00:04:40,671
Where's Jim Bowie?

27
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:42,746
He's indisposed, sir.

28
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:45,559
By God, if you mean drunk,
you say drunk, sir.

29
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,654
He's drunk, sir.

30
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:50,307
What's your name?
- James Butler Bonham.

31
00:04:50,407 --> 00:04:52,527
ln Travis's command, sir.

32
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,839
Neill, you go north with me.

33
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:05,511
Colonel Travis will
be in command here.

34
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,993
Major, sir.
- Colonel Travis.

35
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:11,257
l'll send the commission through.
- Thank you, General.

36
00:05:11,356 --> 00:05:13,193
Let me assure you l'll do...

37
00:05:13,293 --> 00:05:16,005
We'll dispense with
the amenities. Now...

38
00:05:16,105 --> 00:05:18,998
...l've been given command
of the armies of Texas.

39
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:22,948
But the fly in the buttermilk is
there ain't no armies in Texas.

40
00:05:23,048 --> 00:05:25,462
A few good friends
and some willing men.

41
00:05:25,562 --> 00:05:28,575
l'm gonna have to knock
some of those men into an army...

42
00:05:28,674 --> 00:05:30,650
...and to do that l need time.

43
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:33,087
You people right here
on the real ground...

44
00:05:33,186 --> 00:05:35,079
...are gonna have to
buy me that time.

45
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:37,752
You have to keep Santa Anna
off the back of my neck...

46
00:05:37,852 --> 00:05:39,956
...until l can get in
shape to fight him.

47
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:41,423
So you're ordering me to...

48
00:05:41,523 --> 00:05:43,688
Dammit. l am ordering
you to command.

49
00:05:43,788 --> 00:05:45,893
How and what you do
is your problem.

50
00:05:45,992 --> 00:05:47,968
But, Sam, what about Jim Bowie?

51
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:51,679
Jim Bowie, as Mr Bonham
has informed us, is indisposed.

52
00:05:51,778 --> 00:05:53,953
Yes, sir. But l'd like to point out...

53
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:57,105
...that Jim Bowie is leading
a hundred volunteers...

54
00:05:57,205 --> 00:06:00,856
...whereas young Travis here
commands less than 30 regulars.

55
00:06:00,956 --> 00:06:02,293
27.

56
00:06:02,393 --> 00:06:05,645
General Houston, l think
we oughta discuss this...

57
00:06:05,745 --> 00:06:09,129
Clear the room. Gentlemen,
l would have...

58
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:13,045
...a word with Mr Travis
if you'll excuse us.

59
00:06:23,102 --> 00:06:27,631
Mr Travis, were you going to
complain to me about Jim Bowie?

60
00:06:27,731 --> 00:06:29,307
Not complain, sir.

61
00:06:29,407 --> 00:06:31,622
Of course Jim Bowie's drunk.

62
00:06:31,722 --> 00:06:33,831
He took this town
from General Cos.

63
00:06:33,931 --> 00:06:35,053
He fought a battle.

64
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:37,148
And now he's drunk.

65
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:39,433
Seems kinda natural to me.

66
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:43,384
Or perhaps you
question something...

67
00:06:43,484 --> 00:06:45,189
...other than Bowie's drinking.

68
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:48,461
Are you gonna tell me that he's got
a lot of acreage around here?

69
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:51,015
That he's married into
the Mexican aristocracy?

70
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:52,092
Yes, sir.

71
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:54,207
l would trust Jim
Bowie with my life.

72
00:06:54,307 --> 00:06:57,639
More than that, l would trust him
with the lives of my family.

73
00:06:57,738 --> 00:06:59,678
And more than that,
l would trust him...

74
00:06:59,778 --> 00:07:00,871
...with the life of Texas.

75
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:03,433
Sir.
- That's all, Travis.

76
00:07:03,564 --> 00:07:05,560
Travis.

77
00:07:09,191 --> 00:07:11,166
l've never been able to like you.

78
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:13,750
But you are another
one of the very few...

79
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:16,274
...men l would trust
with the life of Texas.

80
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:18,349
For that, thank you, sir.

81
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:21,002
And it may very well be...

82
00:07:21,122 --> 00:07:24,683
...that that life rests
in your hands now.

83
00:07:48,224 --> 00:07:50,219
Jethro. ls that you?

84
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:52,274
Yes, sir, General. This is me.

85
00:07:52,374 --> 00:07:54,150
How are you still alive?

86
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,067
You had white hair
when l was a boy...

87
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:57,542
...and now we look the same age.

88
00:07:57,641 --> 00:07:59,098
Yes, sir.

89
00:07:59,198 --> 00:08:04,455
But l've been a temperate and
God-fearing man all my life, sir.

90
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:07,729
Well, l guess my past is out.

91
00:08:07,857 --> 00:08:11,867
Jethro, you tell your Mr Jim
l'm sorry to hear about his illness.

92
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:13,942
l wish him a speedy recovery.

93
00:08:14,042 --> 00:08:16,535
And assure him of my
undying affection.

94
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:17,932
Yes, sir.

95
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:20,326
And, General Sam,
sir, he love you too.

96
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:21,867
And them words of yours...

97
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:24,037
...gonna put him right
back on his feet.

98
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,591
He got a colic, you know.
- l heard.

99
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:28,187
ln the stomach.

100
00:08:28,287 --> 00:08:29,903
Stay temperate, old man.

101
00:08:30,003 --> 00:08:31,180
Neill.

102
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,275
Column right. Forward.

103
00:08:36,707 --> 00:08:38,702
Take care, men.

104
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,940
You all right, Mr Jim?

105
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,061
Yeah.

106
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,141
Sit down, Jeth.

107
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:48,843
Can l get you something, sir?
- No, no.

108
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:50,943
You just sit there.

109
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:01,705
Houston's gone?

110
00:10:01,785 --> 00:10:03,785
Yes, sir.

111
00:10:06,786 --> 00:10:09,858
Come and gone and
me lying drunk.

112
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,336
Colonel Travis.
Bowie's approaching.

113
00:10:38,742 --> 00:10:40,742
Halt.

114
00:10:41,622 --> 00:10:43,853
Carry on, sentry.

115
00:10:47,023 --> 00:10:49,023
Recall work parties.

116
00:10:49,103 --> 00:10:51,823
Prepare for flag ceremony.

117
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:57,858
Detail. Forward... march.

118
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:27,902
Present... arms.

119
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,786
Order... arms.

120
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:39,771
We stand here ready
to do our duty,

121
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:42,677
and cognisant of the will of God.

122
00:11:43,632 --> 00:11:45,632
Captain Dickinson.

123
00:11:45,712 --> 00:11:47,712
Dismiss the ceremony.

124
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:49,978
And, Captain, inform the men that...

125
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:52,573
...work details will be
dismissed at 4.30...

126
00:11:52,673 --> 00:11:54,914
...in order that family
men may gather...

127
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,974
...their dependants
within these walls.

128
00:11:57,074 --> 00:11:59,074
Yes, sir.

129
00:12:05,595 --> 00:12:07,575
Lieutenant Blake.
- Yes, sir.

130
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:10,496
You will see to the quartering
of Bowie's volunteers.

131
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:11,776
Yes, sir.

132
00:12:11,876 --> 00:12:13,876
You men will follow me.

133
00:12:19,837 --> 00:12:23,018
Jeth, Blake'll show you
to our quarters. Set 'em up.

134
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:25,118
Yes, sir.

135
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:51,882
Colonel Bowie.

136
00:12:52,802 --> 00:12:56,079
Santa Anna's got an
army of 7,000 men.

137
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:01,184
So?

138
00:13:01,284 --> 00:13:05,104
Well, you ain't gonna try to defend
this broken-down church...

139
00:13:05,204 --> 00:13:07,745
...against 7,000 battle-hard troops?

140
00:13:07,845 --> 00:13:09,845
Colonel Bowie.

141
00:13:09,925 --> 00:13:13,146
You were drunk at the
last officers' call.

142
00:13:13,246 --> 00:13:16,866
And l would rather postpone
our discussion until the next.

143
00:13:16,966 --> 00:13:19,467
At which time l will
explain my plans...

144
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:24,157
...and give orders for
the implementing of those plans.

145
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:49,246
Hey, Jim.

146
00:13:49,346 --> 00:13:51,887
Why do we have to work like this?

147
00:13:51,987 --> 00:13:54,727
l volunteered to fight,
not to build no fort.

148
00:13:54,827 --> 00:13:56,887
How come we have
to work like this?

149
00:13:56,987 --> 00:13:59,968
Because old Sam told Travis,
Travis told me,

150
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:02,068
and l'm telling you.

151
00:14:03,028 --> 00:14:06,294
Somebody's comin'
hellbent for leather,

152
00:14:06,394 --> 00:14:08,774
sinking spurs at every jump.

153
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:11,430
Halt.

154
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,210
Corporal of the guard.

155
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,310
Post No.1.

156
00:14:18,231 --> 00:14:21,611
No civilians may enter the fort,
Señor Seguin. l'm sorry.

157
00:14:21,711 --> 00:14:24,372
Juan. Silverio.
Let 'em through, Dick.

158
00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:26,472
Captain Dickinson.

159
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:27,772
Yes, sir.

160
00:14:27,872 --> 00:14:30,683
Come to my office,
please, Captain.

161
00:14:30,783 --> 00:14:32,783
Yes, sir.

162
00:14:37,434 --> 00:14:41,134
Good afternoon, Colonel Travis.
We have news of Santa Anna.

163
00:14:41,234 --> 00:14:44,055
My son and l have...
- Good day, Señor Seguin.

164
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:45,986
Señor, even though you're...

165
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,455
...the alcalde of
San Antonio de Bexar,

166
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,896
it does not exempt you
from military prohibitions.

167
00:14:51,996 --> 00:14:54,976
This establishment is
closed to all civilians.

168
00:14:55,076 --> 00:14:57,057
l'm very sorry, Colonel Travis.

169
00:14:57,157 --> 00:15:00,497
Had l known your restrictions
applied to me and my family, sir...

170
00:15:00,597 --> 00:15:02,116
Now, wait a minute, Travis.

171
00:15:02,216 --> 00:15:04,258
The Seguins have
news of Santa Anna.

172
00:15:04,358 --> 00:15:07,378
We have a dozen rumours a day.
- You can't just...

173
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:09,459
Por favor, Juan, tell him.

174
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:11,939
Colonel, the lndians of San Blas...

175
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,980
...sent couriers to the vaqueros of...

176
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,180
...my properties along
the Sangre de Cristo.

177
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,700
They say many soldiers crossed
the Baja Diablo two days ago.

178
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,461
That puts 'em a lot closer
than you thought.

179
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:26,501
The lndians guessed the number
of troops at over 5,000.

180
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:28,571
There are also large numbers of...

181
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:30,702
...mounted soldiers
and supply trains.

182
00:15:30,802 --> 00:15:32,971
Also, lower down on
the Baja Diablo...

183
00:15:33,071 --> 00:15:35,182
...another party of
lndians saw signs...

184
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:38,543
...of shod horses crossing a ford.
- l'm sorry, Señor Seguin.

185
00:15:38,643 --> 00:15:42,664
As a civilian, you cannot realise
how worthless this information is.

186
00:15:42,764 --> 00:15:44,824
''Some lndian told
some vaqueros..."

187
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:46,864
Anyway, thank you, sir. Good day.

188
00:15:46,964 --> 00:15:49,745
You know the Seguins
are absolutely reliable.

189
00:15:49,845 --> 00:15:51,082
lf you'll excuse me.

190
00:15:51,182 --> 00:15:53,385
l meant no personal
offence, señor.

191
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,506
But l cannot make a plan
based on third-hand rumours.

192
00:15:56,606 --> 00:16:00,599
l do not take personal affront,
Colonel Travis,

193
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,363
else l should be forced to act...

194
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,948
...other than to simply
bid you good day.

195
00:16:17,969 --> 00:16:20,264
You're a damn fool, Travis.

196
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:01,941
A true gentleman, Seguin.

197
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,637
l dislike being rude to him.

198
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:11,997
Even allowing for exaggeration,

199
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:15,358
Santa Anna must have
crossed the Baja in strength.

200
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,583
But l had to do it, Dick.

201
00:17:18,818 --> 00:17:21,117
l'd say we have two or at best...

202
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:23,799
...three days before
we see his banners.

203
00:17:23,899 --> 00:17:25,900
The men were listening.

204
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,528
And l can't let that
rabble know how weak...

205
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:32,859
...we are and how
strong the enemy is.

206
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,491
You couldn't do that?
- No, l couldn't.

207
00:17:37,861 --> 00:17:41,772
My honest and truthful
and plain-spoken friend.

208
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:44,082
You could, perhaps, but l couldn't.

209
00:17:44,182 --> 00:17:46,163
Now, take a look at this.

210
00:17:46,263 --> 00:17:48,243
This oblique rampart here...

211
00:17:48,343 --> 00:17:50,493
Well, have sense,
Dick. Why should...

212
00:17:50,593 --> 00:17:52,804
...those men stay if
they knew the truth?

213
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:54,884
lt's different for Bowie, of course.

214
00:17:54,984 --> 00:17:58,405
He's got a big stake in Texas.
A couple of million acres, l hear.

215
00:17:58,505 --> 00:18:00,307
Some of those men haven't got...

216
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:02,325
Have you got any dollars or acres?

217
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:06,506
l've got an extra suit of clothes.
You know that.

218
00:18:15,878 --> 00:18:18,109
Boy. So that's it.

219
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,239
San Antonio de Bexar.

220
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:22,459
lt means Saint Anthony in English.

221
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,705
The colonel speaks
Spanish, you know.

222
00:18:31,801 --> 00:18:33,841
Are you gonna pray, sir?

223
00:18:35,441 --> 00:18:37,442
But why, sir?

224
00:18:37,522 --> 00:18:40,542
l mean, there wasn't
no doubt we'd find her.

225
00:18:40,642 --> 00:18:43,052
The colonel just wasn't
sure which one...

226
00:18:43,152 --> 00:18:45,623
...of these here creeks
was the shortest cut.

227
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:48,143
He ain't been here
in nigh 1 5 years.

228
00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:50,224
Better make the signal, boy.

229
00:18:50,324 --> 00:18:52,324
Yes, sir.

230
00:18:52,404 --> 00:18:54,384
l hope this powder ain't damp.

231
00:18:54,484 --> 00:18:55,970
You don't take it wrong...

232
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,265
...l ask you all these
questions, Parson?

233
00:18:58,365 --> 00:19:01,145
No, boy, that's how
you learn. Asking.

234
00:19:01,245 --> 00:19:03,246
Yes, sir.

235
00:19:03,326 --> 00:19:07,406
So many times every day
you stop and give thanks.

236
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:11,267
Mostly l can't catch on to what
you're thanking the Lord for.

237
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,427
l mean, there's nothin' special.

238
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,948
l give thanks for the
time and the place.

239
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:18,028
The time and place, Parson?

240
00:19:18,128 --> 00:19:21,828
A time to live and a place to die.
That's all any man gets.

241
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:24,284
No more, no less.

242
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:27,287
Fire the signal, boy.
- Yes, sir.

243
00:19:39,891 --> 00:19:42,187
Must be Parson and the boy.

244
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:46,292
Think so.

245
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:31,759
Well, there she be, Colonel.

246
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:33,920
After 20 days of hard ridin'.

247
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,538
Are we gonna have to learn...

248
00:20:35,638 --> 00:20:37,480
...the lingo they
use down here, Davy?

249
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,401
Where do we go, Davy?
To the town or to the fort?

250
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:42,801
There's no fort. lt's an old mission.

251
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:47,402
You better take a better look.
A lot of people movin' in there.

252
00:20:47,502 --> 00:20:50,282
Them guns don't give it
no mission look to me.

253
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,382
Colonel...

254
00:20:52,462 --> 00:20:57,218
What do C-A-N-T-l-N-A spell?

255
00:20:57,343 --> 00:20:59,944
Cantina. Do it mean
what l think it do?

256
00:21:00,044 --> 00:21:01,044
lt do.

257
00:21:01,144 --> 00:21:05,774
lt means out of these deerskins
and into our foofaraw.

258
00:21:19,787 --> 00:21:21,787
Hey, you got my coat.

259
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:35,727
Hey, Pedro.

260
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,807
Hand me down that guitar.

261
00:21:37,907 --> 00:21:41,408
Now l want you folks to all
clump in here close together.

262
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:44,088
l want you Texicans
to open up your ears...

263
00:21:44,188 --> 00:21:47,674
...and listen to a
little pure Tennessee.

264
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:50,769
Here's to the ladies...

265
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:52,870
...l love 'em all

266
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:56,465
Here's to the ones l recall

267
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,591
Here's to the ladies

268
00:21:58,671 --> 00:22:00,531
Married or free

269
00:22:00,631 --> 00:22:03,748
They all look pretty good to me

270
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:05,652
The big and small ones

271
00:22:05,752 --> 00:22:07,372
The short and tall ones

272
00:22:07,472 --> 00:22:09,472
Each one a lovely...

273
00:22:09,552 --> 00:22:11,553
Halt.

274
00:22:12,553 --> 00:22:14,013
Here's to the ladies...

275
00:22:14,113 --> 00:22:16,707
...l love the ladies...

276
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:19,254
Captain Dickinson,
split your patrol.

277
00:22:19,354 --> 00:22:21,441
Send half each way
down the river for...

278
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,574
...about five miles to
look for any signs.

279
00:22:23,674 --> 00:22:26,055
Then report back to the mission.
- Yes, sir.

280
00:22:26,155 --> 00:22:28,155
Forward.

281
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,160
Sorry, sir.

282
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,240
She sorta come loose.

283
00:23:04,161 --> 00:23:06,161
l'd like...

284
00:23:06,921 --> 00:23:09,682
...l'd like to speak
to David Crockett.

285
00:23:09,782 --> 00:23:10,782
You did.

286
00:23:10,882 --> 00:23:13,382
That was David Crockett
from Tennessee?

287
00:23:13,482 --> 00:23:15,211
Yes, sir. And l oughta know.

288
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,423
Me and him's
neighbours back home.

289
00:23:17,523 --> 00:23:19,563
Only live 40 mile apart.

290
00:23:20,363 --> 00:23:22,364
Colonel Davy.

291
00:23:28,564 --> 00:23:31,465
Are you David Crockett, sir?
- That's my name.

292
00:23:31,565 --> 00:23:34,025
l'm Colonel Travis,
commanding the garrison.

293
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,546
l figured.

294
00:23:35,646 --> 00:23:39,131
Well, son, you'd better
start growing up.

295
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,467
l'd like to speak to you
on a matter of gravest importance.

296
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:48,765
Sure. Let's find a corner.

297
00:23:51,088 --> 00:23:53,088
Talking's dry work.

298
00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:01,890
You're learnin' fast.

299
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,590
Colonel.

300
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,691
l'm resignin' from you.

301
00:24:08,771 --> 00:24:12,471
l'm gonna marry up with Conchita
and be the man of this house.

302
00:24:12,571 --> 00:24:14,612
Bésame a kiss, señorita.

303
00:24:14,652 --> 00:24:17,472
l toss around a mess
of that proud Spanish, too.

304
00:24:17,572 --> 00:24:19,572
Most important part.

305
00:24:19,652 --> 00:24:22,118
Let's jig a little, mamacita.

306
00:24:24,484 --> 00:24:26,904
Light there and rest easy, Travis,

307
00:24:27,004 --> 00:24:29,300
while l bed down this buck.

308
00:24:29,805 --> 00:24:33,035
He just ain't got no
head for whiskey.

309
00:24:34,966 --> 00:24:36,966
Parson.
- Yeah, Davy.

310
00:24:37,046 --> 00:24:39,514
Take him away.
- Yes, sir.

311
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:47,804
Let's wet our whistles.

312
00:24:47,928 --> 00:24:49,928
Words are dusty.

313
00:24:50,008 --> 00:24:52,008
l don't drink.

314
00:24:52,808 --> 00:24:54,809
Not ever?
- No.

315
00:24:56,249 --> 00:24:58,558
l've heard of such.

316
00:24:58,689 --> 00:25:00,830
Well, spread your
wampum, Travis.

317
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,930
My title is colonel.

318
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:05,010
Me, l'm a colonel, too.

319
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,751
Wouldn't it sound kinda silly,
chattering colonel, colonel,

320
00:25:08,851 --> 00:25:11,071
like a couple of
marsh shield birds?

321
00:25:11,171 --> 00:25:13,632
Just speak right up
and call me Crockett.

322
00:25:13,732 --> 00:25:15,712
Don't bother to use my title.

323
00:25:15,812 --> 00:25:18,519
Old drunken General
Flatford gave it...

324
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:20,833
...to me in the Choctaw lndian War.

325
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:23,003
l'll call you Travis.

326
00:25:27,414 --> 00:25:29,414
Very well, Crockett.

327
00:25:30,374 --> 00:25:34,195
l'd like your permission
to make a speech to your men.

328
00:25:34,295 --> 00:25:38,155
Well, they've heard many a speech
while l was congressifying.

329
00:25:38,255 --> 00:25:40,236
What would you talk about?

330
00:25:40,336 --> 00:25:43,328
Oh, about freedom... liberty.

331
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:47,077
Well, they don't need
any such speech.

332
00:25:47,177 --> 00:25:49,157
These men are from Tennessee.

333
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:51,969
l'd like to explain why l want them...

334
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:54,998
...to volunteer to fight
against Santa Anna.

335
00:25:55,098 --> 00:25:57,098
Oh?

336
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,059
Not so careless.

337
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:07,670
You can't get new clothes
this side of Nacogdoches.

338
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,660
Tag.

339
00:26:13,861 --> 00:26:17,041
Tennesseans ain't exactly
against fighting,

340
00:26:17,141 --> 00:26:19,340
but they ain't much for listening...

341
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,762
...to speeches. What
would you tell them?

342
00:26:21,862 --> 00:26:23,992
Of the many and
unendurable hardships...

343
00:26:24,092 --> 00:26:26,003
...the people have
been subjected to...

344
00:26:26,103 --> 00:26:28,183
...under the tyrannical government...

345
00:26:28,283 --> 00:26:30,363
...of this military
dictator Santa Anna.

346
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:34,044
We have no rights in the courts,
no market for our produce.

347
00:26:34,144 --> 00:26:37,375
He has forbidden
trade with the North.

348
00:26:37,505 --> 00:26:39,505
Davy.

349
00:26:39,905 --> 00:26:41,885
l want a chance
for my money back.

350
00:26:41,985 --> 00:26:43,911
Why don't you leave Davy alone?

351
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:46,446
He done beat you 38
times hand-runnin'.

352
00:26:46,546 --> 00:26:47,726
36.

353
00:26:47,826 --> 00:26:49,826
38.

354
00:26:50,227 --> 00:26:51,807
36.

355
00:26:51,907 --> 00:26:54,327
This'll only take a minute, Travis.

356
00:26:54,427 --> 00:26:56,428
Give me them feathers.

357
00:26:57,948 --> 00:26:59,948
Gentlemen.

358
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,789
Balance your feathers.

359
00:27:06,989 --> 00:27:08,989
Get set. Go.

360
00:27:29,513 --> 00:27:33,593
Gotcha that time, Davy.
- lt was fair and square.

361
00:27:34,033 --> 00:27:36,421
lf we can continue, l
would like to say...

362
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:37,574
One minute, Travis.

363
00:27:37,674 --> 00:27:40,094
That was just for who
gets first chance.

364
00:27:40,194 --> 00:27:43,425
Prepare yourself, Davy.
- l'm prepared.

365
00:27:45,235 --> 00:27:47,235
He's still on his feet.

366
00:27:47,315 --> 00:27:48,536
Oh, no.

367
00:27:48,636 --> 00:27:51,230
Oh, yes.
- Oh, yes.

368
00:27:51,356 --> 00:27:53,356
And it's my turn.

369
00:27:58,797 --> 00:28:00,797
39.

370
00:28:02,838 --> 00:28:06,748
He'll never learn.
Let's get a bucket of water.

371
00:28:07,638 --> 00:28:10,459
Kind of a game the boys play
back in Tennessee.

372
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,260
Even though time is running out,
l must postpone this interview...

373
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,100
...until we can be assured
of no interruptions.

374
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,380
Step down off your
high horse, mister.

375
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,136
You don't get lard
less'n you boil the hog.

376
00:28:27,282 --> 00:28:29,512
Have one of these cigars.

377
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:33,212
l brought 'em all the way
from New Orleans.

378
00:28:34,483 --> 00:28:36,983
Were you going to tell
my Tennesseans...

379
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,123
...that a good many men,

380
00:28:39,163 --> 00:28:41,164
sound men all,

381
00:28:41,244 --> 00:28:45,104
had a plot to ease the suffering
of the people in these parts?

382
00:28:45,204 --> 00:28:46,936
Or were you going to tell them...

383
00:28:47,036 --> 00:28:49,145
...that Steve Austin,
Houston and others...

384
00:28:49,245 --> 00:28:54,431
...and you too, Travis, had planned
to declare for a republic?

385
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,796
To declare this the
Republic of Texas?

386
00:28:57,886 --> 00:29:01,032
Were you gonna tell
'em that, Travis?

387
00:29:02,527 --> 00:29:05,187
l hadn't thought this was generally
known.

388
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:07,288
lt isn't yet.

389
00:29:07,368 --> 00:29:11,618
Not till Austin separates
the sheep from the goats.

390
00:29:11,768 --> 00:29:15,509
Not till he decides
who's on the right side.

391
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:17,929
Republic.

392
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:19,990
l like the sound of the word.

393
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,150
lt means people can live free,

394
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,250
talk free,

395
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,371
go or come, buy or sell,

396
00:29:26,411 --> 00:29:28,951
be drunk or sober.
However they choose.

397
00:29:29,051 --> 00:29:32,249
Some words give you a feeling.

398
00:29:32,372 --> 00:29:34,752
Republic is one of
those words that...

399
00:29:34,852 --> 00:29:37,572
...makes me tight in the throat.

400
00:29:38,012 --> 00:29:40,793
Same tightness a
man gets when his...

401
00:29:40,893 --> 00:29:43,783
...baby takes his first step or...

402
00:29:44,173 --> 00:29:46,194
...his first baby shaves...

403
00:29:46,294 --> 00:29:49,694
...and makes his first
sound like a man.

404
00:29:50,694 --> 00:29:55,795
Some words can give you a feeling
that makes your heart warm.

405
00:29:56,015 --> 00:29:58,651
Republic is one of those words.

406
00:30:05,497 --> 00:30:07,497
Crockett.

407
00:30:10,577 --> 00:30:13,558
l have, l believe,
learned two things about you.

408
00:30:13,658 --> 00:30:15,658
Worthwhile, l hope.

409
00:30:15,738 --> 00:30:18,436
You're not the illiterate
country bumpkin...

410
00:30:18,536 --> 00:30:20,359
...you would have people believe.

411
00:30:20,459 --> 00:30:24,040
You speak an excellent and
concise English when you wish.

412
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,280
The... bad grammar is a pose.

413
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,579
A fella has to do a
lot to get elected to

414
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,721
Congress. l've kissed
many a baby, too.

415
00:30:32,821 --> 00:30:36,882
The other is that you came
to Texas to fight with us.

416
00:30:36,982 --> 00:30:39,617
Don't tell my Tennesseans that.

417
00:30:39,942 --> 00:30:44,892
They think we came south
to hunt and... get drunk.

418
00:30:49,263 --> 00:30:52,654
They... seem to have
accomplished that.

419
00:32:44,432 --> 00:32:47,748
Good evening, my
almost-vanishing lady.

420
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:55,454
lncredible. l arranged
for this carriage...

421
00:32:55,554 --> 00:32:58,214
...l would be heartbroken
if you left Bexar just now.

422
00:32:58,314 --> 00:33:01,015
Even more so if you left
with my team of horses,

423
00:33:01,115 --> 00:33:04,135
which would bring
a pretty penny in these times...

424
00:33:04,235 --> 00:33:08,401
...with two factions
buying anything on four legs.

425
00:33:24,518 --> 00:33:26,499
Do you have business here?

426
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:28,179
l promised Mother.

427
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:29,899
Your mother?

428
00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:33,260
Pray to the North Star.
Ten minutes every night.

429
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,080
A long line of star-worshippers.

430
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,741
lt keeps the rheumatiz away.

431
00:33:41,081 --> 00:33:43,661
lt seems to me you're
looking for trouble.

432
00:33:43,761 --> 00:33:45,762
lt do?

433
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:51,404
Let's go upstairs.
Unless you prefer...

434
00:33:51,505 --> 00:33:52,903
...discussing your business...

435
00:33:53,003 --> 00:33:56,828
...in front of every
drunken loafer in Bexar.

436
00:34:09,245 --> 00:34:11,706
l suppose that
overdressed ignoramus...

437
00:34:11,806 --> 00:34:14,586
...is one of the riffraff
here to resist Santa Anna.

438
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:16,693
They'll find graves
and nothing else.

439
00:34:16,793 --> 00:34:18,467
Santa Anna will sweep across...

440
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:19,567
Overdressed?

441
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:21,747
l paid good money
for these clothes.

442
00:34:21,847 --> 00:34:23,847
Why?

443
00:34:34,209 --> 00:34:36,209
Lady's luggage.

444
00:34:47,731 --> 00:34:50,537
Gratuity for the boy. You forgot.

445
00:35:02,573 --> 00:35:05,634
Son, l guess he isn't gonna tip you.

446
00:35:18,536 --> 00:35:20,596
Another thing l promised Mother.

447
00:35:20,696 --> 00:35:24,717
Never to get in situations
where people pointed guns at me.

448
00:35:24,817 --> 00:35:27,277
Ma'am, it is possible
that l am mistaken,

449
00:35:27,377 --> 00:35:31,318
but it seems to me you find this
gentleman's company distasteful.

450
00:35:31,418 --> 00:35:32,918
Tell him to get out.

451
00:35:33,018 --> 00:35:36,879
Thank you, sir, but there is no way
in which you could be of help.

452
00:35:36,979 --> 00:35:41,399
And l am in no danger.
- l bid you good night, ma'am.

453
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,020
Gratuity for the boy.

454
00:35:53,021 --> 00:35:55,022
Your property, sir.

455
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:25,501
We are guaranteed the protection
of the generalissimo himself.

456
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:28,022
But please don't
misunderstand me.

457
00:36:28,122 --> 00:36:30,102
l don't want all of your lands.

458
00:36:30,202 --> 00:36:34,113
Half will be sufficient for me.
l'm no glutton.

459
00:36:45,124 --> 00:36:47,425
Easy, Graciela, easy. l speak your...

460
00:36:47,525 --> 00:36:49,825
...language, but that's
too fast for me.

461
00:36:49,925 --> 00:36:53,186
Though l dare say
l'm better off not understanding.

462
00:36:53,286 --> 00:36:55,666
You actually wanted
me to agree to this?

463
00:36:55,766 --> 00:36:57,766
This atrocity?.

464
00:36:57,846 --> 00:37:00,652
l actually did and l actually do.

465
00:37:01,327 --> 00:37:03,407
You're an educated
woman, Graciela.

466
00:37:03,507 --> 00:37:04,507
lntelligent.

467
00:37:04,607 --> 00:37:08,188
ls there any other way
to restore your family properties?

468
00:37:08,288 --> 00:37:11,688
Santa Anna's administrators
rule Potos?

469
00:37:12,489 --> 00:37:14,869
You... you expect me to marry you,

470
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:17,498
with my father and
four brothers newly...

471
00:37:17,598 --> 00:37:19,750
...buried in Potos?..
and my husband?

472
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:22,670
l expect it because it
is the logical course.

473
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:25,204
To marry you? Logical?.

474
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,831
Of course.

475
00:37:26,931 --> 00:37:28,911
l am acceptable to Santa Anna.

476
00:37:29,011 --> 00:37:32,125
lf he should be defeated,
l will manage...

477
00:37:32,225 --> 00:37:35,112
...to become acceptable
to his successors.

478
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:39,973
That's the trick. To be acceptable
to the powers that be.

479
00:37:40,173 --> 00:37:43,193
Let's not pretend
you're a broken-hearted widow.

480
00:37:43,293 --> 00:37:45,334
You barely knew the man.

481
00:37:45,374 --> 00:37:47,433
The marriage was as
much arranged...

482
00:37:47,533 --> 00:37:48,714
...as this one would be.

483
00:37:48,814 --> 00:37:52,395
Your family picked him up.
- That's the way of my people.

484
00:37:52,495 --> 00:37:54,115
You'll say yes.

485
00:37:54,215 --> 00:37:56,680
lt's your only possible path.

486
00:37:57,255 --> 00:38:00,556
Like all women,
you'll postpone the decision.

487
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:03,011
But you will say yes.

488
00:38:45,582 --> 00:38:47,401
Forgive me, ma'am, but l was...

489
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:49,682
...having a smoke out
on that gallery...

490
00:38:49,783 --> 00:38:52,113
...and l couldn't
help but overhear...

491
00:38:52,213 --> 00:38:53,603
...l wasn't eavesdropping.

492
00:38:53,703 --> 00:38:56,281
But it rankles me when
somebody tries...

493
00:38:56,381 --> 00:38:58,564
...to force somebody
to do something.

494
00:38:58,664 --> 00:39:01,120
You haven't seen
me before tonight,

495
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,605
but l am offering you my services.

496
00:39:03,705 --> 00:39:06,445
lf that fella's making
you stay in Bexar,

497
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:09,205
l'm ready, willing and able
to provide you...

498
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:11,726
...a transport to
wherever you wanna go.

499
00:39:11,826 --> 00:39:15,246
And on the other hand,
if you choose to stay in Bexar,

500
00:39:15,346 --> 00:39:20,362
l'm ready, willing and able
to see that he don't bother you.

501
00:39:21,707 --> 00:39:24,095
Would you answer
one question with...

502
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,648
...complete honesty,
Mr... Tall American?

503
00:39:26,748 --> 00:39:30,089
Ma'am, only modesty
restrains me from telling you...

504
00:39:30,189 --> 00:39:34,014
...that l am widely known
for my truthfulness.

505
00:39:34,669 --> 00:39:37,474
Would you so quickly
offer to defend me...

506
00:39:37,574 --> 00:39:39,970
...if l were 60 years
old and wrinkled?

507
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:43,371
Or is it because
l am young and a widow...

508
00:39:43,471 --> 00:39:47,551
...and you are far from home
and your loved ones?

509
00:39:51,072 --> 00:39:53,461
But thank you, anyway, sir.

510
00:39:55,473 --> 00:39:57,473
ln any event,

511
00:39:57,553 --> 00:40:01,634
this is a matter in which
no outsider could help.

512
00:40:02,314 --> 00:40:04,314
Mr Tall American.

513
00:40:05,034 --> 00:40:07,523
l do believe that
a woman in trouble,

514
00:40:07,624 --> 00:40:09,495
even though 60 and wrinkled,

515
00:40:09,595 --> 00:40:11,890
could turn to you for help.

516
00:40:14,276 --> 00:40:16,276
Good night, ma'am.

517
00:41:31,847 --> 00:41:33,268
Well, thanks, friend.

518
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:37,068
lf you don't insist on having them
to yourself, l'll give you a hand.

519
00:41:37,168 --> 00:41:39,169
Pleasure, friend.

520
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:42,067
You must be Jim Bowie.

521
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,629
The size and the shape
is as described...

522
00:41:44,729 --> 00:41:47,630
...and this knife is certainly
everything l heard it was.

523
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:50,280
l'm Bowie.
- l'm Davy Crockett.

524
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,616
Well. l've heard a lot about you.

525
00:41:53,651 --> 00:41:56,031
l've heard a lot about you, too.

526
00:41:56,131 --> 00:41:58,392
l'd admire to buy you a drink,
or eight or ten.

527
00:41:58,492 --> 00:42:00,492
Oh... Excuse me.

528
00:42:02,092 --> 00:42:04,593
Did you have some trouble
with Emil Sand?

529
00:42:04,693 --> 00:42:06,673
Who's Emil Sand?
- Merchant.

530
00:42:06,773 --> 00:42:09,513
Tall fella? Butter-coloured hair?
- That's him.

531
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:12,674
l've had some words with him.
lntend to have some more.

532
00:42:12,774 --> 00:42:13,960
How about that drink?

533
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,836
Honoured, Congressman Crockett.

534
00:42:15,936 --> 00:42:21,467
Please, Jim. Don't call me that.
l've been trying to live it down.

535
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:39,453
Here's your extra
coat, Davy. And a jug.

536
00:42:39,553 --> 00:42:42,657
Thoughtful. You'd better
get some sleep, Smitty.

537
00:42:42,757 --> 00:42:44,759
l'm not tired.

538
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:46,821
lt's Mexico. Exciting night.

539
00:42:46,922 --> 00:42:49,825
Yeah, well, you'd still
better get some sleep.

540
00:42:49,925 --> 00:42:51,927
All right, Davy.

541
00:42:52,007 --> 00:42:52,828
Night, Smitty.

542
00:42:52,928 --> 00:42:55,736
Good night, Colonel Bowie... Jim.

543
00:43:00,857 --> 00:43:03,880
Took a long time for
this night to get unexciting.

544
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,983
lt sure did.

545
00:43:06,704 --> 00:43:09,427
'Tis a mighty pretty one though.

546
00:43:09,947 --> 00:43:11,901
l understand you
moved down here...

547
00:43:12,001 --> 00:43:13,611
...lock, stock, and barrel, Jim.

548
00:43:13,711 --> 00:43:18,016
l didn't plan on moving.
Came for a visit and stayed.

549
00:43:18,116 --> 00:43:19,435
l gather you like it.

550
00:43:19,535 --> 00:43:21,700
Oh, Davy. lf you only knew Mexico.

551
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,998
lt's wonderful.

552
00:43:24,123 --> 00:43:27,667
l thought she was a burnt-over
desert most of the time.

553
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:31,271
Nah... Most northerners
think that. lt ain't so.

554
00:43:31,371 --> 00:43:34,572
Big valleys between
high mountains.

555
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:38,759
Just everything a man could want
in the way of country.

556
00:43:38,859 --> 00:43:42,777
For looking at or...
or for growing on.

557
00:43:42,904 --> 00:43:45,295
But mostly...

558
00:43:45,427 --> 00:43:47,894
Mostly it's the people, Davy.

559
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,512
They got...

560
00:43:50,552 --> 00:43:53,175
This is kinda hard to explain, but...

561
00:43:53,275 --> 00:43:56,499
...they got courage
and they got dignity.

562
00:43:56,599 --> 00:43:59,355
They ain't afraid to die.

563
00:43:59,482 --> 00:44:04,107
What seems most important to me
is that they ain't afraid to live.

564
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:06,455
Today is important to them,

565
00:44:06,555 --> 00:44:09,618
not the dollar
tomorrow might bring.

566
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:12,837
l suppose the Yankee
says that's lazy.

567
00:44:12,937 --> 00:44:16,411
Me? l say it's a way of livin'.

568
00:44:18,023 --> 00:44:20,025
And the womenfolk.

569
00:44:20,105 --> 00:44:21,327
Well, Davy...

570
00:44:21,427 --> 00:44:24,090
...l figured you favoured
the Mexican ladies.

571
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:26,657
They tell me you married one.

572
00:44:27,473 --> 00:44:29,476
Yeah, l...

573
00:44:29,556 --> 00:44:31,558
...l did.

574
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:34,161
l...

575
00:44:35,002 --> 00:44:37,004
Well, Davy, l...

576
00:44:37,084 --> 00:44:40,483
...l just ain't got,
you know, your way...

577
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:44,072
...of putting things
into... into words, but...

578
00:44:44,172 --> 00:44:46,174
...l got a fine family.

579
00:44:47,576 --> 00:44:49,694
A wonderful wife and...

580
00:44:49,818 --> 00:44:52,051
...two fine boys.

581
00:44:53,823 --> 00:44:57,226
l guess l'm what you'd
call a lucky man.

582
00:44:57,226 --> 00:45:01,251
Now, that ain't a bad stab
at putting it into words.

583
00:45:01,351 --> 00:45:04,326
l... sent them up to Coahuila with...

584
00:45:04,426 --> 00:45:08,086
...all the trouble
around here, you know...

585
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,463
May l speak privately with you, sir?
- Sure, but...

586
00:45:12,563 --> 00:45:15,427
Aren't you Señora de López?
- Señor Bowie, l'm sorry.

587
00:45:15,527 --> 00:45:18,870
l did not recognise you.
- This place ain't fit for...

588
00:45:18,971 --> 00:45:20,953
...l know. But the matter is urgent.

589
00:45:21,053 --> 00:45:24,317
Could l have a few private words
with this gentleman?

590
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:25,678
Sure. Excuse me.

591
00:45:25,778 --> 00:45:28,011
l'll be inside, Crockett.

592
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:30,338
Crockett?

593
00:45:30,463 --> 00:45:32,606
You are the famous
David Crockett?

594
00:45:32,706 --> 00:45:34,708
Well, l'm Crockett.

595
00:45:34,788 --> 00:45:36,873
They named me Davy
after an uncle...

596
00:45:36,973 --> 00:45:39,293
...that didn't leave
Pa the farm after all.

597
00:45:39,393 --> 00:45:42,023
Mr Crockett, shortly
after you left my...

598
00:45:42,123 --> 00:45:44,819
...room l heard an
altercation in the street.

599
00:45:44,919 --> 00:45:46,281
l could hear the sound,

600
00:45:46,381 --> 00:45:48,664
though l could not
see from my window.

601
00:45:48,764 --> 00:45:50,746
lt sounded like a drunken brawl.

602
00:45:50,846 --> 00:45:53,749
Well, sittin' right here
l didn't hear a thing.

603
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:57,353
Well, anyway, l saw lights
in the old church...

604
00:45:57,453 --> 00:46:00,637
...and people moving about.
And one of them was Emil.

605
00:46:00,737 --> 00:46:02,439
And... a thought came to me.

606
00:46:02,539 --> 00:46:05,442
As you may know,
Colonel Travis has ordered...

607
00:46:05,542 --> 00:46:08,646
...all powder and ball
from the merchants of Bexar.

608
00:46:08,746 --> 00:46:11,809
And he didn't find any
at Emil's warehouse.

609
00:46:11,909 --> 00:46:17,441
lt's my opinion... it's all hidden
in the basement of that church.

610
00:46:17,876 --> 00:46:19,878
And... Mr Crockett...

611
00:46:19,958 --> 00:46:22,283
The defenders of
Texas are going to...

612
00:46:22,383 --> 00:46:24,584
...need that powder
against Santa Anna.

613
00:46:24,684 --> 00:46:28,107
And you're against Santa Anna?
- Bitterly. Of course.

614
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:30,510
And this... Emil? He's for him?

615
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:32,612
Yes, he is.

616
00:46:32,733 --> 00:46:35,115
Then, how did he figure
you'd marry him?

617
00:46:35,215 --> 00:46:38,119
Political arguments
don't flavour folks' supper.

618
00:46:38,219 --> 00:46:40,336
Nevertheless, l am
going to marry him.

619
00:46:40,436 --> 00:46:42,724
Please let's not
discuss it, Mr Crockett.

620
00:46:42,824 --> 00:46:45,647
The name is Davy,
and l couldn't sleep nights...

621
00:46:45,747 --> 00:46:48,130
Will you say goodbye
for me to Mr Bowie?

622
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:50,532
Well, l...
- l can make my own way...

623
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:54,121
...and l hope the
information is helpful.

624
00:47:08,933 --> 00:47:10,915
Something interesting, Jim.

625
00:47:11,015 --> 00:47:13,352
Parson, round up a
couple of the men,

626
00:47:13,452 --> 00:47:16,241
fairly sober, and meet
us out in the street.

627
00:47:16,341 --> 00:47:18,699
Where are we goin'?

628
00:47:18,824 --> 00:47:20,866
The church.
- Yeah, Davy.

629
00:47:29,276 --> 00:47:31,278
Hey.

630
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:33,360
Parson.

631
00:47:34,281 --> 00:47:36,060
Why'd you run off without me?

632
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,506
l told him to stay
behind. He's drunk.

633
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:41,589
Stick to the point.
Why'd you run off without me?

634
00:47:41,689 --> 00:47:43,832
Jim, this is Beekeeper. Jim Bowie.

635
00:47:43,932 --> 00:47:45,974
Hi.
- You can come along.

636
00:47:46,014 --> 00:47:48,916
But hold your breath.
Can they smell,

637
00:47:49,016 --> 00:47:51,520
they'll be warned you're coming.

638
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,623
Excuse me.

639
00:48:12,323 --> 00:48:14,326
Grab that torch.
- Yeah.

640
00:48:23,736 --> 00:48:25,738
Excuse me.

641
00:48:51,767 --> 00:48:53,769
Well. Here, Parson.

642
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:55,852
Yes, sir.

643
00:49:02,179 --> 00:49:04,476
Rifles.
- Must be 50 of 'em.

644
00:49:09,307 --> 00:49:10,528
That's gunpowder.

645
00:49:10,628 --> 00:49:13,291
Let me take a look at that stuff.
- Watch it.

646
00:49:13,391 --> 00:49:16,710
Stand back and stand still.
- Excuse me.

647
00:49:18,277 --> 00:49:20,259
There must be a ton of it.

648
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:24,223
l'm sure gonna be looking forward
to seeing that soldier boy's face...

649
00:49:24,323 --> 00:49:26,451
...when we bring this in.

650
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:12,182
lt's a beautiful
morning, Davy Crockett.

651
00:51:12,282 --> 00:51:14,594
lt is that,

652
00:51:14,725 --> 00:51:16,727
María de López y Vejar.

653
00:51:16,808 --> 00:51:19,030
My goodness. You
remember all that?

654
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:23,385
Sure. l'm not as stupid
as l look from the outside.

655
00:51:23,495 --> 00:51:26,376
What's Spanish for breakfast?

656
00:51:26,498 --> 00:51:29,642
Let's take a paseado out
and get some desayuno.

657
00:51:29,742 --> 00:51:31,724
Paseado?
- That means ''walk''.

658
00:51:31,824 --> 00:51:35,208
That means ''have walked''.
But never mind. l'll get dressed.

659
00:51:35,308 --> 00:51:37,310
Wait a minute.

660
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:40,093
First, write me a letter.

661
00:51:40,194 --> 00:51:42,196
A letter?

662
00:51:42,276 --> 00:51:44,278
ln Spanish.
- Of course.

663
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,062
To whom is the letter addressed?

664
00:51:48,162 --> 00:51:51,186
To the Honorable Davy
Crockett Esquire.

665
00:51:51,286 --> 00:51:53,048
You wish a letter
written to yourself?

666
00:51:53,148 --> 00:51:54,149
Yep.

667
00:51:54,249 --> 00:51:57,313
To the Honorable
Davy Crockett Esquire,

668
00:51:57,413 --> 00:52:01,477
former Congressman of
the United States of America.

669
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:03,580
Esteemed sir...

670
00:52:08,328 --> 00:52:10,330
Hurry it up there.

671
00:52:18,739 --> 00:52:19,740
Seen Davy?

672
00:52:19,841 --> 00:52:23,159
Ain't nobody seen
Davy. He ain't about.

673
00:52:23,385 --> 00:52:26,788
First lie you've told
today, Thimblerig.

674
00:52:27,469 --> 00:52:29,471
Mornin', Davy.
- Howdy.

675
00:52:29,551 --> 00:52:32,094
Say, Davy, what kind
of a load you got there?

676
00:52:32,194 --> 00:52:34,407
Presents for some friends.

677
00:52:34,477 --> 00:52:36,479
Let's go, Parson.

678
00:52:58,704 --> 00:53:00,776
Halt. Who goes there?

679
00:53:00,906 --> 00:53:02,688
ls that you, Bob?

680
00:53:02,788 --> 00:53:05,180
Why, sure. Can't you see?

681
00:53:05,311 --> 00:53:09,656
Then what kind of idiot nonsense
is this ''Who goes there''?

682
00:53:09,756 --> 00:53:12,007
Well, Travis - Colonel
Travis, that is -...

683
00:53:12,107 --> 00:53:13,340
...he says that l should...

684
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,753
...l don't care what
Travis said. Open...

685
00:53:16,853 --> 00:53:20,682
...the gate before l
shoot you off that wall.

686
00:53:22,322 --> 00:53:25,726
Sentry. Open the gate
for Colonel Bowie.

687
00:53:36,818 --> 00:53:38,901
Near a ton of good
powder here, men.

688
00:53:39,001 --> 00:53:40,002
Get it unloaded.

689
00:53:40,102 --> 00:53:43,085
That long one there,
he's Davy Crockett.

690
00:53:43,185 --> 00:53:46,129
And three of his good men.
- Colonel Crockett.

691
00:53:46,229 --> 00:53:48,231
Hello, Travis.

692
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,453
Looks like the answer to a prayer.

693
00:53:50,553 --> 00:53:53,108
Colonel, l'd be pleased
if you'd join me...

694
00:53:53,208 --> 00:53:55,339
...in my quarters
for some refreshment.

695
00:53:55,439 --> 00:53:57,441
Proud to.

696
00:53:57,962 --> 00:54:01,621
Oh, and you too,
Colonel Bowie, if you will.

697
00:54:11,977 --> 00:54:14,400
l'm a stranger around
these here parts.

698
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,323
What do you Texicans use
for drinkin' whiskey?

699
00:54:17,423 --> 00:54:21,508
Drinkin' whiskey.
- You got manners or ain't you?

700
00:54:24,334 --> 00:54:27,518
Captain Dickinson,
this is Colonel Davy Crockett.

701
00:54:27,618 --> 00:54:29,620
Morning, Dick.

702
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:32,243
Oh, and this is my
cousin Mrs Dickinson.

703
00:54:32,343 --> 00:54:34,645
Colonel Crockett.
- Colonel Bowie.

704
00:54:34,746 --> 00:54:37,569
Well, it's nice meeting you,
Davy Crockett.

705
00:54:37,669 --> 00:54:39,651
l feel as if l know you already.

706
00:54:39,751 --> 00:54:42,334
You see, part of my family
come from Tennessee...

707
00:54:42,434 --> 00:54:44,577
...and, well, your
name is a household...

708
00:54:44,677 --> 00:54:46,819
...word there. At least
in our house it was.

709
00:54:46,919 --> 00:54:49,943
Thank you, ma'am.
lt's nice to be well thought of.

710
00:54:50,043 --> 00:54:52,605
Mommy.
- Oh, yes, darling.

711
00:54:53,406 --> 00:54:56,510
Oh. l've asked you
not to climb those stairs alone.

712
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:57,701
Well, who's this?

713
00:54:57,801 --> 00:55:00,034
You say hello to Colonel Crockett?

714
00:55:00,134 --> 00:55:02,136
Hello.

715
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:05,400
Every size they get to
seems to be the most lovable.

716
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,968
Will you gentlemen excuse me?

717
00:55:09,104 --> 00:55:10,766
Goodbye, Colonel.

718
00:55:10,866 --> 00:55:12,868
Goodbye.

719
00:55:12,948 --> 00:55:16,252
Kind of a shame
kids have to grow up into people.

720
00:55:16,352 --> 00:55:20,096
lt's good we're all here, gentlemen.
A cigar?

721
00:55:22,479 --> 00:55:24,901
Please, make yourselves
comfortable.

722
00:55:25,001 --> 00:55:27,985
l have some news.
Fannin is doing well at Goliad.

723
00:55:28,085 --> 00:55:30,588
He has mustered
almost a thousand men...

724
00:55:30,688 --> 00:55:32,578
...and should be
ready to move south...

725
00:55:32,678 --> 00:55:33,871
...by the first of the week.

726
00:55:33,971 --> 00:55:36,950
A thousand? lt
don't seem possible.

727
00:55:36,975 --> 00:55:39,518
lt does sound too good to be true,
l must confess.

728
00:55:39,618 --> 00:55:42,080
But we can only admit
our doubts to each other.

729
00:55:42,181 --> 00:55:45,204
ln the privacy of a room
and not in front of the men.

730
00:55:45,304 --> 00:55:47,648
As far as the volunteers
are concerned,

731
00:55:47,748 --> 00:55:49,969
we're sure Fannin
has a thousand men.

732
00:55:50,069 --> 00:55:53,053
l got a reputation for truth, Travis.
- l ain't.

733
00:55:53,153 --> 00:55:55,909
Everybody says l'm a born liar.

734
00:55:56,036 --> 00:55:58,555
But whether we talk
out loud or quiet...

735
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:00,981
...don't seem to me
the point right now.

736
00:56:01,082 --> 00:56:03,363
The point is how many
men has Fannin...

737
00:56:03,463 --> 00:56:05,146
...and will he get here in time?

738
00:56:05,246 --> 00:56:06,762
Whether he does or doesn't,

739
00:56:06,862 --> 00:56:09,191
we'll be trapped here.
And for no reason.

740
00:56:09,291 --> 00:56:12,354
We should burn all of Bexar,
including this mission.

741
00:56:12,454 --> 00:56:14,438
And annoy Santa Anna
while he sweeps...

742
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:16,158
...north across the whole of Texas?

743
00:56:16,258 --> 00:56:19,042
That's Colonel Bowie's theory.
- We could hit and run.

744
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:21,044
Jump him at every
creek crossing...

745
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:22,906
You seem to forget
one thing, Colonel.

746
00:56:23,006 --> 00:56:24,007
That l command.

747
00:56:24,107 --> 00:56:27,851
And l have already
decided against your plan.

748
00:56:29,794 --> 00:56:31,295
Now...

749
00:56:31,395 --> 00:56:33,978
Let us attack a more
important problem.

750
00:56:34,078 --> 00:56:36,060
Colonel Crockett's Tennesseans.

751
00:56:36,161 --> 00:56:38,288
Will they fight, Colonel?

752
00:56:38,403 --> 00:56:40,673
Last time l saw 'em
they hadn't shown...

753
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:42,868
...any strong feelings
against fighting.

754
00:56:42,968 --> 00:56:45,707
Can you persuade
them to come here?

755
00:56:45,807 --> 00:56:46,953
l can ask them.

756
00:56:47,053 --> 00:56:50,997
And you're a very persuasive man
according to your reputation.

757
00:56:51,097 --> 00:56:53,115
Build up the story that Fannin has...

758
00:56:53,216 --> 00:56:55,122
...a thousand... no,
two thousand men.

759
00:56:55,222 --> 00:56:57,176
Play down the size
of Santa Anna's...

760
00:56:57,276 --> 00:56:58,525
We've been through this.

761
00:56:58,626 --> 00:57:01,409
He wants me to lie to my men, too.
Keep 'em here with lies.

762
00:57:01,509 --> 00:57:03,511
Let the truth of Santa
Anna's strength...

763
00:57:03,611 --> 00:57:05,613
...be known and there
won't be a dozen left.

764
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:07,269
You calling my boys cowards?

765
00:57:07,369 --> 00:57:09,498
Let us dispense with
the pyrotechnics.

766
00:57:09,598 --> 00:57:11,472
Remember this. My
men are volunteers.

767
00:57:11,572 --> 00:57:13,342
They're here because
they wanna be.

768
00:57:13,442 --> 00:57:18,122
But there's nothing to keep 'em
from gettin' outta here.

769
00:57:18,648 --> 00:57:21,711
l'm aware that your
men are militia.

770
00:57:22,212 --> 00:57:24,795
And, like all volunteers,
undisciplined.

771
00:57:24,895 --> 00:57:26,937
Good day, Colonel Bowie.

772
00:57:34,706 --> 00:57:37,992
Last night gave you
a pretty good idea...

773
00:57:38,092 --> 00:57:40,730
...of the discipline of my men.

774
00:57:40,993 --> 00:57:43,631
Our position here is desperate.

775
00:57:45,157 --> 00:57:48,676
And l feel sure that
where Crockett leads...

776
00:57:48,776 --> 00:57:50,503
...his men will follow.

777
00:57:50,603 --> 00:57:52,606
Yeah.

778
00:57:52,686 --> 00:57:57,451
That's a responsibility that's...
been kinda worrying me.

779
00:58:01,816 --> 00:58:04,639
Thank you, gentlemen.
l'm gonna pass the word around.

780
00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:06,243
What you Texans use for...

781
00:58:06,343 --> 00:58:08,683
...drinkin' whiskey...
is drinkin' whiskey.

782
00:58:08,784 --> 00:58:12,648
And what's more important,
you got real good manners,

783
00:58:12,748 --> 00:58:15,609
seein' how you suffer the handicap...

784
00:58:15,709 --> 00:58:18,334
...of having never
been in Tennessee.

785
00:58:18,434 --> 00:58:22,219
Davy, is it true that you fit
a four-day fight with Mike Fink?

786
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,882
Why, that's a blasted lie.

787
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:28,425
One of them stories
loose-mouthed people tell around.

788
00:58:28,526 --> 00:58:30,508
Mike and me quit at sundown.

789
00:58:30,608 --> 00:58:34,192
Wouldn't have been the fourth day
until... next morning.

790
00:58:34,292 --> 00:58:35,593
See you, men.

791
00:58:35,694 --> 00:58:37,696
Let her rip, Parson.

792
00:58:56,812 --> 00:58:58,354
Señora López.

793
00:58:58,454 --> 00:59:00,676
Don Juan, this is
Mr Davy Crockett.

794
00:59:00,776 --> 00:59:02,759
l'm honoured.
- How do you do?

795
00:59:02,859 --> 00:59:04,890
Señor Seguin is the
alcalde... l mean,

796
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:06,803
the mayor of San
Antonio de Bexar.

797
00:59:06,903 --> 00:59:08,885
He's got a pretty busy town.

798
00:59:08,986 --> 00:59:12,449
People are running like sheep
that have smelled a wolf pack.

799
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:15,066
l never said no such a thing.

800
00:59:15,192 --> 00:59:17,281
When us took that powder in there,

801
00:59:17,381 --> 00:59:20,098
that fella Travis asked
if us Tennesseans...

802
00:59:20,198 --> 00:59:22,861
...was gonna join up
with him. That's all.

803
00:59:22,961 --> 00:59:25,304
He never asked us
to fight his fight for him.

804
00:59:25,404 --> 00:59:28,307
Have some breakfast.
- Breakfast?. Tortillas?

805
00:59:28,407 --> 00:59:30,409
Tamale.

806
00:59:33,493 --> 00:59:35,795
Never get burnt drinking this stuff.

807
00:59:35,895 --> 00:59:37,982
Well, l only know part of Texas and...

808
00:59:38,082 --> 00:59:40,280
...none of these Texicans
is related to me,

809
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:42,363
so why should l fight for them?

810
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:45,246
Right. Ain't our ox
that's gettin' gored.

811
00:59:45,346 --> 00:59:49,549
Talkin' about whose ox
gets gored... figure this.

812
00:59:49,671 --> 00:59:52,890
A fella gets in the
habit of goring oxes,

813
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:54,456
whets his appetite.

814
00:59:54,556 --> 00:59:57,339
He may come up north next
and gore yours.

815
00:59:57,439 --> 01:00:00,640
Men, we're in a little fix, sort of.

816
01:00:01,924 --> 01:00:03,651
The he-bull around here -

817
01:00:03,751 --> 01:00:06,189
General Santa Anna.
He's mad at us.

818
01:00:06,289 --> 01:00:07,471
Yeah?

819
01:00:07,571 --> 01:00:09,573
He's wrote us a letter.

820
01:00:09,653 --> 01:00:11,635
l can't read it. lt's in Spanish.

821
01:00:11,735 --> 01:00:13,778
But the young lady will.

822
01:00:23,949 --> 01:00:26,327
lt is addressed to
Davy Crockett and...

823
01:00:26,427 --> 01:00:28,494
...the Tennesseans
who accompany him.

824
01:00:28,594 --> 01:00:30,596
Be it known:

825
01:00:30,676 --> 01:00:32,992
You are interlopers
in a country where...

826
01:00:33,092 --> 01:00:35,061
...you are neither
wanted nor welcome.

827
01:00:35,161 --> 01:00:37,144
This is the order you are given.

828
01:00:37,244 --> 01:00:39,273
Depart with all haste and at once,

829
01:00:39,373 --> 01:00:41,709
because it has come
to our attention...

830
01:00:41,809 --> 01:00:44,352
...that you are possibly
considering joining...

831
01:00:44,452 --> 01:00:46,554
...the rebels now
skulking in the mission.

832
01:00:46,654 --> 01:00:49,855
This is not your fight. Depart.

833
01:00:49,978 --> 01:00:53,297
Should you fail to
abide by this order,

834
01:00:53,542 --> 01:00:56,696
l shall chastise
you even unto death.

835
01:00:56,825 --> 01:01:01,427
Signed: Generalissimo
Antonio Miguel de Santa Anna.

836
01:01:04,114 --> 01:01:07,057
Fella kinda fancies
himself, don't he?

837
01:01:07,157 --> 01:01:09,780
Sure does have a
big-sounding name.

838
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,780
Givin' us orders. Who
do he think he is?

839
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,305
Andy by God Jackson?

840
01:01:14,405 --> 01:01:18,510
Riles me when somebody tells me
to go here or l can't go there.

841
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:20,912
l ain't never been
run out of no place.

842
01:01:21,012 --> 01:01:24,276
Except the time my old paw
kicked me over every acre...

843
01:01:24,376 --> 01:01:27,039
...of that half-section
back there in Ohio.

844
01:01:27,139 --> 01:01:30,483
But l was just a shirt-tail kid then.
My paw had big feet.

845
01:01:30,583 --> 01:01:33,526
What do you say, Davy?
Are we gonna let this man...

846
01:01:33,626 --> 01:01:35,609
...tell us what we can or can't do?

847
01:01:35,709 --> 01:01:40,814
Davy, maybe we'd better saddle up
and pay this fella a visit.

848
01:01:43,317 --> 01:01:45,440
Do chastise mean
what l think it do?

849
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:46,541
lt do.

850
01:01:46,641 --> 01:01:49,448
Davy, let's do saddle
up and go learn...

851
01:01:49,548 --> 01:01:51,426
...that gentleman his manners.

852
01:01:51,526 --> 01:01:56,191
We won't have to. He's wearin' out
horses comin' toward us.

853
01:01:56,292 --> 01:01:58,955
Well, l guess we can't
stop him from coming.

854
01:01:59,055 --> 01:02:02,318
But l reckon we can arrange
for him to limp going back.

855
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:04,435
l was thinking these Texicans...

856
01:02:04,535 --> 01:02:07,003
...wasn't as neighbourly
as they might be.

857
01:02:07,104 --> 01:02:09,041
But here they've
gone and arranged...

858
01:02:09,141 --> 01:02:10,648
...a nice fight for us visitors.

859
01:02:10,748 --> 01:02:14,532
One thing l oughta tell you.
Santa Anna never wrote that letter.

860
01:02:14,632 --> 01:02:16,174
l did.

861
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:18,937
Or rather... l had this
lady here write it.

862
01:02:19,037 --> 01:02:23,382
l was figuring how to tell you fellas
about this Texican hoedown.

863
01:02:23,482 --> 01:02:25,591
l wondered what Santa
Anna would've...

864
01:02:25,691 --> 01:02:28,027
...said to us if he'd
had a chance to say it.

865
01:02:28,127 --> 01:02:30,910
Davy, l ain't never said
l ain't been whupped. l have.

866
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:32,765
But l give every one of them fellas...

867
01:02:32,865 --> 01:02:34,714
...a chance to dig in
and get the job done.

868
01:02:34,814 --> 01:02:37,001
But l ain't never
took nobody's word...

869
01:02:37,101 --> 01:02:38,599
...that they was gonna chas...

870
01:02:38,699 --> 01:02:41,081
Chastise.
- Chastise. Much obliged.

871
01:02:41,181 --> 01:02:44,365
We're gonna stay, ain't we?
- l'm thinking it over.

872
01:02:44,465 --> 01:02:47,288
What is there to think about?
You getting that old?

873
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:49,451
The man toed the
mark and dared us.

874
01:02:49,551 --> 01:02:52,454
Chastise, he said.
- That's right. Chastise.

875
01:02:52,554 --> 01:02:55,738
But l wrote the letter.
- Don't you start weaslin'.

876
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:58,264
You said them'd be the
words he'd write...

877
01:02:58,365 --> 01:03:00,143
...if he was to write us a letter.

878
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:02,665
Well, gentlemen,
you've convinced me.

879
01:03:02,765 --> 01:03:04,768
We'll fight.

880
01:03:04,848 --> 01:03:07,791
That's more like it.
- Now you're talkin', Davy.

881
01:03:07,891 --> 01:03:10,634
First, the young lady and l
will take a pasear.

882
01:03:10,734 --> 01:03:15,279
Gather up your possibles
and l'll meet up with you later.

883
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:17,592
Your Spanish is improving.

884
01:03:19,184 --> 01:03:22,367
lt kinda cheers me to see
the colonel with that lady.

885
01:03:22,467 --> 01:03:25,786
Last couple of years
he had me worried.

886
01:03:25,911 --> 01:03:29,695
Lately he ain't been looking
at the girls like he was starved.

887
01:03:29,796 --> 01:03:33,540
Being in Congress
has ruined many a good man.

888
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:43,702
All l hear is Crockett
the bear-killer...

889
01:03:43,802 --> 01:03:45,985
Crockett the lndian-fighter...

890
01:03:46,085 --> 01:03:48,087
Crockett the brawler...

891
01:03:48,167 --> 01:03:50,399
Crockett has brains.

892
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:52,712
Kept it hidden a number of years.

893
01:03:52,812 --> 01:03:55,475
You like my Tennesseans, Flaca?
- Oh, yes.

894
01:03:55,575 --> 01:04:00,000
Could strain 10,000
and never come up with 23 better.

895
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:04,165
Every one of those men has been
at my elbow, save the boy Smitty,

896
01:04:04,265 --> 01:04:07,419
when some difficulty arose.

897
01:04:07,549 --> 01:04:09,749
Some of them don't bathe as often...

898
01:04:09,849 --> 01:04:12,174
...as polite folks
would think necessary.

899
01:04:12,274 --> 01:04:15,678
But every one of them
smells sweet to me.

900
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:21,544
And l was the one that said
this country was burnt-over sand.

901
01:04:21,644 --> 01:04:23,646
lt's green and growing.

902
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:28,101
Like those green pastures
they talk about.

903
01:04:29,853 --> 01:04:33,737
Lord above. That's
one beautiful tree.

904
01:04:56,443 --> 01:04:58,705
This tree must've been growed...

905
01:04:58,806 --> 01:05:03,911
...before man put his first
dirty footprints on this prairie.

906
01:05:06,054 --> 01:05:10,053
Kind of a tree Adam and Eve
must have met under.

907
01:05:18,027 --> 01:05:20,239
You know something, Flaca?

908
01:05:20,269 --> 01:05:22,692
l guess l saw
who knows how many trees...

909
01:05:22,792 --> 01:05:25,976
...before l ever took
a long, thoughtful look at one.

910
01:05:26,076 --> 01:05:29,713
Mostly l looked at a
tree to see was there...

911
01:05:29,813 --> 01:05:32,783
...a bear in it or an lndian behind it.

912
01:05:32,883 --> 01:05:35,862
Davy, what's going
to happen to us?

913
01:05:36,768 --> 01:05:39,159
l mean, to you and me.

914
01:05:39,291 --> 01:05:41,145
l'm gonna tell you
something, Flaca,

915
01:05:41,245 --> 01:05:42,834
and l want you to listen tight.

916
01:05:42,935 --> 01:05:45,155
lt may sound like
l'm talking about me,

917
01:05:45,255 --> 01:05:46,719
but l'm talkin' about you.

918
01:05:46,819 --> 01:05:49,602
ln fact, l'm talking about
all people everywhere.

919
01:05:49,702 --> 01:05:53,326
When l came down here to Texas,
l was looking for something.

920
01:05:53,426 --> 01:05:55,465
l didn't know what.

921
01:05:55,589 --> 01:05:57,811
lt seems like you added up my life,

922
01:05:57,911 --> 01:06:01,059
and l'd spent it all
either stomping other...

923
01:06:01,159 --> 01:06:03,738
...men or in some
cases getting stomped.

924
01:06:03,838 --> 01:06:06,821
Had me some money
and had me some medals.

925
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:08,900
But none of it seemed a lifetime...

926
01:06:09,001 --> 01:06:11,386
...worth the pain of
the mother that bore me.

927
01:06:11,486 --> 01:06:13,489
lt's like l was empty.

928
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:15,551
Well, l'm not empty any more.

929
01:06:15,651 --> 01:06:17,929
That's what's important.

930
01:06:18,054 --> 01:06:20,316
To feel useful in this old world.

931
01:06:20,416 --> 01:06:24,801
To hit a lick against what's wrong,
or to say a word for what's right...

932
01:06:24,901 --> 01:06:28,165
...even though you get walloped
for sayin' that word.

933
01:06:28,265 --> 01:06:30,220
l may sound like a Bible-beater...

934
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,570
...yellin' up a revival
at a camp meeting,

935
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:35,093
but that don't change
the truth none.

936
01:06:35,193 --> 01:06:38,536
There's right and there's wrong.
You gotta do one or the other.

937
01:06:38,637 --> 01:06:40,619
You do the one and you're living.

938
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:44,112
You do the other and
you may be walking...

939
01:06:44,212 --> 01:06:47,871
...around, but you're
dead as a beaver hat.

940
01:06:49,368 --> 01:06:52,015
l'd hoped for a horse, but there's...

941
01:06:52,116 --> 01:06:54,835
...nothing wrong with
a good strong mule.

942
01:06:54,935 --> 01:06:57,292
My things.

943
01:06:57,417 --> 01:06:59,400
All my luggage is in the buggy.

944
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:01,482
Had my men take care of it.

945
01:07:01,582 --> 01:07:04,353
Your geegaws may
be rough-packed...

946
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:06,581
...but they're all there.

947
01:07:10,792 --> 01:07:13,430
You are sending me away. You...

948
01:07:14,476 --> 01:07:18,646
You talked about the fight
against evil but you...

949
01:07:19,442 --> 01:07:21,910
You are sending me to safety.

950
01:07:22,525 --> 01:07:24,948
Flaca, you have an
important name.

951
01:07:25,048 --> 01:07:28,512
You know a million words
and how they should be used.

952
01:07:28,612 --> 01:07:32,677
l'm sending you to fight your war,
to talk up a howling mob.

953
01:07:32,777 --> 01:07:35,330
l'll stay here and hit a lick.

954
01:07:37,382 --> 01:07:39,765
l hope you can drive a mule.

955
01:07:39,785 --> 01:07:41,927
His name's Jesús, they told me.

956
01:07:42,027 --> 01:07:44,749
He seems a good, honest mule.

957
01:07:51,357 --> 01:07:53,820
Maybe l'll never see you again.

958
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:57,024
lf that's what's written,
that's what's written.

959
01:07:57,124 --> 01:07:59,106
When it's time, it's time.

960
01:07:59,206 --> 01:08:01,709
Talkin' only makes it
the harder, Flaca.

961
01:08:01,809 --> 01:08:03,811
So stir up that mule.

962
01:08:03,891 --> 01:08:05,894
Davy, l...

963
01:08:19,469 --> 01:08:21,936
You never pray, do you, Davy?

964
01:08:25,555 --> 01:08:27,558
l never found the time.

965
01:08:53,118 --> 01:08:55,120
Sir. Tennesseans.

966
01:08:59,806 --> 01:09:02,447
Colonel Travis.

967
01:09:02,569 --> 01:09:04,571
Crockett and his men.

968
01:09:08,095 --> 01:09:10,077
Go down and open the gate.

969
01:09:10,177 --> 01:09:12,179
l'll just holler down.

970
01:09:12,259 --> 01:09:15,843
Your orders were to go down,
not holler down, Mr Dennison.

971
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:17,946
Yes, sir.

972
01:09:32,602 --> 01:09:34,664
Crack shots, those Tennesseans.

973
01:09:34,764 --> 01:09:38,549
Twenty times their number's
what we need, and more.

974
01:09:38,649 --> 01:09:42,673
Oh, l'm sorry, Will. Such gloomy
remarks are for your ears alone.

975
01:09:42,773 --> 01:09:46,347
lsn't that Bowie
galloping up to catch 'em?

976
01:09:50,302 --> 01:09:52,684
l can just hear him
pleading his cause.

977
01:09:52,784 --> 01:09:54,854
Crockett seems to me
the type of man...

978
01:09:54,954 --> 01:09:56,208
...that would choose Bowie.

979
01:09:56,308 --> 01:09:57,199
What you mean is...

980
01:09:57,299 --> 01:09:59,131
...he isn't the type
of man to choose me.

981
01:09:59,232 --> 01:10:02,215
Oh, Will. Depend on you
to say it the most brutal way.

982
01:10:02,315 --> 01:10:04,707
Most facts are brutal.

983
01:10:09,203 --> 01:10:12,626
Just look at that great knife fighter
yapping at Crockett.

984
01:10:12,727 --> 01:10:14,729
Cut, slash, and run.

985
01:10:14,809 --> 01:10:17,592
Let's get mounted.
Cut, slash, and run.

986
01:10:17,692 --> 01:10:19,694
Cut, slash, and run.

987
01:10:19,774 --> 01:10:23,479
Cost Santa Anna a hundred troops
at every creek crossing...

988
01:10:23,579 --> 01:10:25,561
...between here and the North.

989
01:10:25,661 --> 01:10:28,164
Sounds reasonable
the way you put it,

990
01:10:28,264 --> 01:10:31,247
but Travis has a point, too.
Takes thinkin' on.

991
01:10:31,347 --> 01:10:32,368
Hey, Jim.

992
01:10:32,469 --> 01:10:34,587
Halt. Who goes there?

993
01:10:34,711 --> 01:10:38,896
Bob, l swear l'm gonna shoot you
off that wall. Are you blind?

994
01:10:38,996 --> 01:10:40,397
That's what l was told
to holler every...

995
01:10:40,497 --> 01:10:41,499
...time.

996
01:10:41,599 --> 01:10:43,581
Well, don't holler at me.

997
01:10:43,681 --> 01:10:45,263
ldiot.

998
01:10:45,363 --> 01:10:49,022
You think on it, Davy.
You'll side with me.

999
01:10:57,576 --> 01:10:59,579
What is it?

1000
01:10:59,659 --> 01:11:03,603
Tennesseans, Nell. 23 of 'em.
All the way from home.

1001
01:11:03,703 --> 01:11:07,007
Do you recognise any, Jocko?
ls my brother Malachi with them?

1002
01:11:07,107 --> 01:11:09,490
He was a fella to go
where there was trouble.

1003
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:11,592
He was that.

1004
01:11:11,672 --> 01:11:13,895
But, Nell, you know
Malachi was hung.

1005
01:11:13,995 --> 01:11:16,122
Or so some folks told us.

1006
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:21,135
Colonel Crockett. l am
glad you were able...

1007
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:23,385
...to persuade your men to join us.

1008
01:11:23,485 --> 01:11:25,467
Well, they insisted, sort of.

1009
01:11:25,568 --> 01:11:27,570
Our heartiest welcome.

1010
01:11:28,291 --> 01:11:30,293
Ladies and gentlemen,

1011
01:11:30,373 --> 01:11:33,757
we are proud to welcome
these patriotic men...

1012
01:11:33,857 --> 01:11:37,401
...who have travelled 1 500 miles
to join us in our hour of need.

1013
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:39,483
Sergeant Lightfoot.
- Yes, sir?

1014
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:41,012
You will have your men...

1015
01:11:41,112 --> 01:11:43,367
...raise a cheer for
our gallant allies...

1016
01:11:43,467 --> 01:11:45,550
...from the illustrious
state of Tennessee.

1017
01:11:45,650 --> 01:11:46,651
Yes, sir.

1018
01:11:46,751 --> 01:11:48,753
Hip. Hip.
- Hooray.

1019
01:11:49,274 --> 01:11:51,276
Hip. Hip.
- Hooray.

1020
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:53,908
Hip. Hip.
- Hooray.

1021
01:11:54,039 --> 01:11:57,463
Captain, you will attend to
the billeting of these men.

1022
01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:00,945
After you are quartered,
l will take you...

1023
01:12:01,045 --> 01:12:03,390
...on a tour of the emplacements.

1024
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:05,492
This way, gentlemen.

1025
01:12:08,736 --> 01:12:10,778
Crockett. Davy Crockett.

1026
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:16,004
We're from Tennessee.
- Well, howdy, folks.

1027
01:12:16,104 --> 01:12:18,647
We seen you when you came
to Stink Wells...

1028
01:12:18,747 --> 01:12:21,209
...to speak about that
job for the Congress.

1029
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:24,173
You shook hands with me.
- l'll do her again.

1030
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:26,255
He didn't vote for you, though.

1031
01:12:26,355 --> 01:12:28,938
Other fella gave him four bits.
- l'm sorry.

1032
01:12:29,038 --> 01:12:32,742
Don't be. Glad there were
enough sensible folks like you...

1033
01:12:32,842 --> 01:12:34,825
...to vote me out of that job.

1034
01:12:34,925 --> 01:12:38,028
Well, later on we'll have
a real old home talkfest.

1035
01:12:38,128 --> 01:12:41,266
Right now we've got
to get quartered...

1036
01:12:41,366 --> 01:12:44,770
...and bedded down.
Would you excuse us?

1037
01:12:44,976 --> 01:12:48,124
You should have
voted for him, Jocko.

1038
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:34,341
Of our 24 pieces of ordnance,
five are these six-pounders.

1039
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:36,939
Something's stirring in town.

1040
01:13:45,789 --> 01:13:47,771
Ladies will take cover, please.

1041
01:13:47,871 --> 01:13:50,424
Men, to your battle positions.

1042
01:14:44,093 --> 01:14:46,836
Captain Dickinson,
are your men disposed?

1043
01:14:46,936 --> 01:14:48,975
At their posts, sir.

1044
01:14:53,424 --> 01:14:56,499
No one will fire unless l so order.

1045
01:14:56,627 --> 01:15:01,393
Those people are under
the protection of a flag of truce.

1046
01:15:13,326 --> 01:15:15,836
From Generalissimo
Antonio López de

1047
01:15:15,936 --> 01:15:18,592
Santa Anna, absolute
ruler of Mexico,

1048
01:15:18,692 --> 01:15:21,595
to the rebel commander
who deems himself in command...

1049
01:15:21,695 --> 01:15:23,878
...of the rebels
occupying the mission.

1050
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:25,980
Be it known:

1051
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:28,601
The province of Mexico
known as Texas...

1052
01:15:28,701 --> 01:15:32,401
...has shown itself to be
in active and treasonous revolt...

1053
01:15:32,502 --> 01:15:35,242
...against the rule of
Generalissimo Santa Anna.

1054
01:15:35,342 --> 01:15:37,963
The generalissimo issues
the following order.

1055
01:15:38,063 --> 01:15:41,244
All occupants of the mission
will leave at once,

1056
01:15:41,344 --> 01:15:44,244
leaving all arms
and ammunition behind them.

1057
01:15:44,344 --> 01:15:46,885
lf this order is not followed
with dispatch,

1058
01:15:46,985 --> 01:15:50,086
the generalissimo will reduce
the mission by assault.

1059
01:15:50,186 --> 01:15:52,821
There will be no quarter given.

1060
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:28,180
Well, what do you think, Jim?

1061
01:16:30,515 --> 01:16:35,701
l hate to say anything good about
that long-winded jackanapes,

1062
01:16:35,956 --> 01:16:39,782
but he does know
the short way to start a war.

1063
01:17:02,803 --> 01:17:04,803
The Sixth...

1064
01:17:05,923 --> 01:17:08,729
The Sixth Vera Cruzano Fusiliers.

1065
01:17:12,805 --> 01:17:16,506
They're bivouacking about
a mile south of our west bastion.

1066
01:17:16,606 --> 01:17:19,347
Light artillery,
lancers, some engineers.

1067
01:17:19,447 --> 01:17:22,010
Not one unit of heavy
assault troops yet,

1068
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:24,228
and it still adds up to 2,000 men.

1069
01:17:24,328 --> 01:17:26,468
That'll be to our advantage, Dick.

1070
01:17:26,568 --> 01:17:30,224
That main body must be
strung out for miles.

1071
01:17:30,889 --> 01:17:34,390
The assault infantry,
heavy artillery and supply trains...

1072
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:36,791
They won't be here
for four or five days.

1073
01:17:36,891 --> 01:17:39,471
The actual battle
can't start until then.

1074
01:17:39,571 --> 01:17:43,592
Oh, there'll be an occasional sortie
feeling out our defences.

1075
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:46,063
But they won't commit
to an attack until

1076
01:17:46,163 --> 01:17:48,473
Santa Anna is here
with his main force.

1077
01:17:48,574 --> 01:17:52,362
Then what?
- Then Fannin will be here.

1078
01:17:57,496 --> 01:18:00,216
More troops arriving every hour.

1079
01:18:00,616 --> 01:18:03,415
Prettiest army l ever did see.

1080
01:18:03,537 --> 01:18:05,538
Yeah.

1081
01:18:05,618 --> 01:18:07,878
lf l take my men out,
do you go with me?

1082
01:18:07,978 --> 01:18:09,725
Davy, you know this old mission...

1083
01:18:09,826 --> 01:18:11,679
...can't stand up to
Santa Anna's army.

1084
01:18:11,779 --> 01:18:15,120
My way's the only way.
- Travis says that Fannin's coming.

1085
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:18,442
Travis says. l wouldn't
take Travis's...

1086
01:18:18,542 --> 01:18:22,112
...word that night's
dark and day's light.

1087
01:18:23,262 --> 01:18:24,922
Blowin' on a horn. That's all.

1088
01:18:25,022 --> 01:18:27,403
Chicken in the bread bag,
pickin' up the corn. That's all.

1089
01:18:27,503 --> 01:18:30,723
Flies in the buttermilk.
Shoo, fly, shoo. That's all.

1090
01:18:30,823 --> 01:18:33,324
Ants in the sugar bowl.
Two by two. That's all.

1091
01:18:33,424 --> 01:18:37,335
l carried twice as much.
- You're twice as big.

1092
01:18:38,065 --> 01:18:40,066
Patrol's in trouble.

1093
01:18:58,990 --> 01:19:00,991
Doggone it, Beekeeper.

1094
01:19:01,071 --> 01:19:05,092
l thought you wasn't gonna open
that corn liquor till nightfall.

1095
01:19:05,192 --> 01:19:07,912
lt's only a half-hour till dark.

1096
01:19:09,112 --> 01:19:11,093
Besides, it's my keg, ain't it?

1097
01:19:11,193 --> 01:19:13,854
Well, all right. Give
me some of that stuff.

1098
01:19:13,954 --> 01:19:16,254
l'm so scared l could drink all of it.

1099
01:19:16,354 --> 01:19:18,355
Maybe l will.

1100
01:19:18,755 --> 01:19:20,755
What'd you see, lrish?

1101
01:19:20,835 --> 01:19:24,176
More than l wanted to, Jim.
A lot of men arriving.

1102
01:19:24,276 --> 01:19:27,777
And they got the durned
blastedest cannon ever l did see.

1103
01:19:27,877 --> 01:19:29,877
Something like this.

1104
01:19:35,879 --> 01:19:38,089
12 or 1 4 foot long maybe.

1105
01:19:38,199 --> 01:19:41,180
He sure draws pretty, don't he?
- Frightening.

1106
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:44,421
12 or 1 4 feet long.
Are you sure, lrish?

1107
01:19:44,521 --> 01:19:46,521
Well, yeah...
- Finn.

1108
01:19:46,601 --> 01:19:47,662
Yes, sir.

1109
01:19:47,762 --> 01:19:49,416
You were ordered to report to me,

1110
01:19:49,516 --> 01:19:51,582
not to hold lecture
courses. Get up here.

1111
01:19:51,682 --> 01:19:55,278
All right, Will... Colonel Travis.

1112
01:19:58,244 --> 01:20:00,745
Hey, Travis. With
a cannon like that,

1113
01:20:00,845 --> 01:20:03,081
them Santa Anna fellas
can just sit up...

1114
01:20:03,181 --> 01:20:05,306
...there and give us
what for, can't they?

1115
01:20:05,406 --> 01:20:08,266
There's no such cannon
in the North American continent.

1116
01:20:08,366 --> 01:20:11,027
They have some in Europe,
according to last reports.

1117
01:20:11,127 --> 01:20:14,443
Acting Lieutenant
Finn is exaggerating.

1118
01:20:22,130 --> 01:20:23,950
She's a big one, Davy.

1119
01:20:24,050 --> 01:20:26,941
And she's shooting
from over here.

1120
01:20:34,373 --> 01:20:37,008
Battery One. ls your gun ready?

1121
01:20:37,053 --> 01:20:39,034
We're primed and ready, sir.

1122
01:20:39,134 --> 01:20:40,794
Give it full elevation.

1123
01:20:40,894 --> 01:20:42,895
Yes, sir.

1124
01:20:46,815 --> 01:20:48,816
The gun is ready, sir.

1125
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:50,896
Fire.

1126
01:20:58,098 --> 01:21:01,329
Kinda short there,
Colonel, Mr Travis.

1127
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:09,517
l'm sure l'm glad l seen
that there cannon...

1128
01:21:09,617 --> 01:21:11,521
...sitting out there on that prairie.

1129
01:21:11,621 --> 01:21:14,362
For a minute l thought
they was shooting at us...

1130
01:21:14,462 --> 01:21:16,883
...from one of them countries
over in Europe.

1131
01:21:16,983 --> 01:21:18,983
Oh, my goodness.

1132
01:21:19,063 --> 01:21:21,063
No.

1133
01:21:21,144 --> 01:21:24,261
Oh, no. They wouldn't dare.

1134
01:21:24,384 --> 01:21:28,219
Man, that ain't no fair
way to fight a war.

1135
01:21:32,906 --> 01:21:36,607
Well, l guess we'd better do
somethin' about that, Crockett.

1136
01:21:36,707 --> 01:21:39,368
Plain as can be.
- About an hour after dark?

1137
01:21:39,468 --> 01:21:41,468
Good.

1138
01:21:41,788 --> 01:21:43,789
Thimblerig, 1 5 men.

1139
01:21:43,869 --> 01:21:45,869
Right after dark.

1140
01:21:45,949 --> 01:21:47,950
All sober.

1141
01:21:59,392 --> 01:22:01,393
Halt.
- l lost the bet.

1142
01:22:01,473 --> 01:22:04,774
l bet my friends l could sneak up
on you without you hearing me.

1143
01:22:04,874 --> 01:22:08,615
Friend, you like to got
a hole in your head.

1144
01:22:12,596 --> 01:22:13,778
Tie him loose.

1145
01:22:13,878 --> 01:22:17,612
Kick that fire out and
kill our silhouette.

1146
01:22:17,837 --> 01:22:20,557
Let's go. Company One, let's go.

1147
01:22:34,201 --> 01:22:36,181
Everything set?
- Yes, sir.

1148
01:22:36,281 --> 01:22:38,262
All right. lt's time, men.

1149
01:22:38,362 --> 01:22:42,103
Open the gate.
- Colonel Travis, sentry here.

1150
01:22:42,523 --> 01:22:45,223
Somebody jumped me.
- l'll say they did.

1151
01:22:45,323 --> 01:22:47,265
Shoved me down, tied me up, and...

1152
01:22:47,365 --> 01:22:49,424
...some of them
stepped on me goin' by.

1153
01:22:49,524 --> 01:22:51,219
And never so much as...

1154
01:22:51,319 --> 01:22:54,225
...a by-your-leave from
every one of them.

1155
01:22:54,325 --> 01:22:56,326
Dammit.

1156
01:22:59,807 --> 01:23:01,867
Return to your posts.
- Yes, sir.

1157
01:23:01,967 --> 01:23:03,968
Close the gate.

1158
01:23:06,888 --> 01:23:10,029
Well, you'd better get
your men mounted, then.

1159
01:23:10,129 --> 01:23:12,910
See if you can give them any help.
- Yes, sir.

1160
01:23:13,010 --> 01:23:16,003
Detail. Stand to horse.

1161
01:23:37,936 --> 01:23:39,936
Get the powder.

1162
01:23:47,818 --> 01:23:51,389
Where's the mud?
- lt's comin'. Here it is.

1163
01:24:35,829 --> 01:24:37,830
Clear out. l'll cover.

1164
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:41,591
You heard the man.

1165
01:24:46,352 --> 01:24:50,008
Come on, kid. Get outta here.
- l can shoot.

1166
01:24:52,193 --> 01:24:55,594
Golly. What a gun.
- Go on. Grab a horse.

1167
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:06,517
Cannon party.

1168
01:25:06,597 --> 01:25:09,777
No one will fire until
you can identify your target.

1169
01:25:09,877 --> 01:25:11,878
Yes, sir.

1170
01:25:16,879 --> 01:25:20,365
Let's give 'em a hand,
boys. Knock on it.

1171
01:25:35,243 --> 01:25:37,394
Pick 'em up. Pick 'em up.

1172
01:25:37,524 --> 01:25:41,265
Everybody rides double.
Come on. Pick 'em up.

1173
01:26:02,530 --> 01:26:07,291
Hold the gate. Hold the gate.
- Somebody's still outside.

1174
01:26:14,092 --> 01:26:16,093
Close the gate.

1175
01:26:17,253 --> 01:26:19,254
Good work, Smitty.

1176
01:26:19,334 --> 01:26:21,594
We never missed you.
Good thing the kid did.

1177
01:26:21,694 --> 01:26:23,515
That horse folded with me.

1178
01:26:23,615 --> 01:26:25,315
You all right, Jim?
- Sure.

1179
01:26:25,415 --> 01:26:28,676
Oh, Mr Smith. You've been hurt.
- Oh, it's all right.

1180
01:26:28,776 --> 01:26:30,836
Let's take a look at that.
- Doctor.

1181
01:26:30,936 --> 01:26:32,937
No bones broken.

1182
01:26:33,017 --> 01:26:36,118
All you need is a little
Doctor Beekeeper's fix-all.

1183
01:26:36,218 --> 01:26:38,218
See? l...

1184
01:26:40,179 --> 01:26:42,179
Pretty close.

1185
01:26:42,259 --> 01:26:43,259
Bowie?

1186
01:26:43,359 --> 01:26:46,760
Oh, he's all right.
Turned a horse over.

1187
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:48,971
Jethro?
- Yes, sir.

1188
01:26:49,101 --> 01:26:52,081
Tell Colonel Bowie
l wish to speak to him at once.

1189
01:26:52,181 --> 01:26:54,182
Yes, sir.

1190
01:26:54,262 --> 01:26:57,083
Over here, where we can
have a little privacy.

1191
01:26:57,183 --> 01:26:59,183
Yes, sir.

1192
01:27:15,458 --> 01:27:17,668
Post this area.
- Yes, sir.

1193
01:27:22,419 --> 01:27:25,520
Will, considering the way
things turned out, l...

1194
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:27,621
Dick, leave this to me.

1195
01:27:50,346 --> 01:27:52,346
Colonel Bowie.

1196
01:27:53,347 --> 01:27:57,088
l have had just about
enough insubordination.

1197
01:27:57,428 --> 01:27:59,428
You have?

1198
01:27:59,508 --> 01:28:02,089
All right. Let's get
to it. When and where?

1199
01:28:02,189 --> 01:28:05,290
l hear you're a good shot,
so let's choose pistols.

1200
01:28:05,390 --> 01:28:07,810
l assumed you would choose
the ruffian's knife.

1201
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:10,251
Gentlemen, l beg...
- Dick, act for me.

1202
01:28:10,351 --> 01:28:12,351
Time?

1203
01:28:12,431 --> 01:28:15,237
l suggest after this war is over.

1204
01:28:16,512 --> 01:28:18,513
Yes.

1205
01:28:18,593 --> 01:28:21,333
The minute...
the very minute this war is over.

1206
01:28:21,433 --> 01:28:23,948
Jim?
- That's fine with me.

1207
01:28:24,994 --> 01:28:26,995
One last word, Bowie.

1208
01:28:27,075 --> 01:28:29,055
This evening's episode...

1209
01:28:29,155 --> 01:28:31,213
By going on a mission
without orders...

1210
01:28:31,313 --> 01:28:32,776
...you endangered this command.

1211
01:28:32,876 --> 01:28:34,231
lf it had not been for...

1212
01:28:34,331 --> 01:28:36,417
...the intervention
of Captain Dickinson,

1213
01:28:36,517 --> 01:28:39,538
a large number of volunteers
would now be dead out there...

1214
01:28:39,638 --> 01:28:41,618
...instead of at their posts in here.

1215
01:28:41,718 --> 01:28:43,548
l demand your word of honour that...

1216
01:28:43,648 --> 01:28:45,739
...there will no repetition
of such conduct.

1217
01:28:45,839 --> 01:28:49,750
Or else l shall be forced
to order your arrest.

1218
01:28:53,721 --> 01:28:55,721
Travis...

1219
01:28:56,402 --> 01:29:01,163
Don't you worry any more
about arrest or insubordination.

1220
01:29:01,883 --> 01:29:04,689
l take my people out at daybreak.

1221
01:29:11,925 --> 01:29:13,926
Colonel Travis...

1222
01:29:14,006 --> 01:29:16,006
...l'm an old man...

1223
01:29:16,086 --> 01:29:18,087
...but you're wrong.

1224
01:29:22,888 --> 01:29:24,888
That Jethro...

1225
01:29:25,568 --> 01:29:27,609
Reminds me of a story...

1226
01:29:27,649 --> 01:29:29,649
Please, Crockett.

1227
01:29:29,729 --> 01:29:32,990
No homespun wisdom.
No cracker-barrel philosophy.

1228
01:29:33,090 --> 01:29:35,311
None of the backwoods wit...

1229
01:29:35,411 --> 01:29:38,511
...for which you are
famous. Good night.

1230
01:29:38,611 --> 01:29:41,352
You'd better slack
off on me, mister.

1231
01:29:41,452 --> 01:29:44,713
This code of honour business
doesn't bother me a bit.

1232
01:29:44,813 --> 01:29:47,554
When there's trouble
l come from any direction...

1233
01:29:47,654 --> 01:29:49,634
...as sudden and
surprising as l can.

1234
01:29:49,734 --> 01:29:53,648
My only concern here
is 23 Tennesseans.

1235
01:29:53,775 --> 01:29:57,771
So you'd better let me know
what's in your mind.

1236
01:29:58,976 --> 01:30:03,397
l'd have thought that would
have been obvious to you.

1237
01:30:05,258 --> 01:30:07,726
lt's as simple as this.

1238
01:30:07,858 --> 01:30:10,976
There's Santa Anna
with 7,000 men.

1239
01:30:11,099 --> 01:30:13,489
Up here is the Sabine River.

1240
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:15,620
Somewhere around here

1241
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:18,441
Sam Houston is trying
to organise an army.

1242
01:30:18,541 --> 01:30:22,581
And right in between...
is the Alamo.

1243
01:30:22,702 --> 01:30:25,012
Santa Anna can't go
around and leave...

1244
01:30:25,112 --> 01:30:27,483
...a fort along his
lines of communication.

1245
01:30:27,583 --> 01:30:29,643
He must reduce the
Alamo by storm.

1246
01:30:29,744 --> 01:30:32,564
Every minute of time
we buy for Sam Houston...

1247
01:30:32,664 --> 01:30:35,765
...is another precious minute
in the life of Texas.

1248
01:30:35,865 --> 01:30:39,526
And nobody is ever going to say
that William Barret Travis...

1249
01:30:39,626 --> 01:30:42,772
...did not buy every
minute possible.

1250
01:30:43,227 --> 01:30:46,047
Makes sense.
Why didn't you tell Bowie that?

1251
01:30:46,147 --> 01:30:49,288
A commander does not have
to explain his every decision.

1252
01:30:49,388 --> 01:30:51,389
You explained to me.

1253
01:30:52,269 --> 01:30:54,489
l have great respect
for you, Crockett.

1254
01:30:54,589 --> 01:30:58,530
But l have none for that
knife-fighting adventurer.

1255
01:30:58,630 --> 01:31:02,811
l figured any fella that shouldered
a gun was deserving of respect.

1256
01:31:02,911 --> 01:31:06,951
But then l'm not... a real soldier.

1257
01:31:07,072 --> 01:31:09,853
l never fought anybody but lnjuns.

1258
01:31:09,953 --> 01:31:11,933
Less'n you count the British.

1259
01:31:12,033 --> 01:31:14,034
Crockett.

1260
01:31:16,835 --> 01:31:21,376
l must ask you to forgive
my rudeness earlier on to you.

1261
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:25,265
l'm an easy forgiver... at times.

1262
01:31:25,397 --> 01:31:27,397
Good night, Travis.

1263
01:31:46,402 --> 01:31:49,382
Crack out a couple of jugs
and bring that guitar.

1264
01:31:49,482 --> 01:31:51,463
What are we gonna do, Davy?

1265
01:31:51,563 --> 01:31:53,563
Serenade.

1266
01:32:05,966 --> 01:32:07,346
Well...

1267
01:32:07,446 --> 01:32:09,864
...l hope you told that
long-winded idiot...

1268
01:32:09,964 --> 01:32:11,147
...what you think of him.

1269
01:32:11,247 --> 01:32:14,805
l'm not rightly sure
what l think of him.

1270
01:32:14,905 --> 01:32:16,906
What's all this?

1271
01:32:17,169 --> 01:32:21,190
Well, l figured we'd crack a jug
and tell each other our troubles.

1272
01:32:21,290 --> 01:32:23,270
Now wait a minute, Crockett.

1273
01:32:23,370 --> 01:32:26,551
Don't try your winnin' ways on me.
My mind's made up.

1274
01:32:26,651 --> 01:32:29,312
Well, we can have a farewell drink.

1275
01:32:29,412 --> 01:32:31,452
You mean you're stayin'?

1276
01:32:31,492 --> 01:32:33,703
That's what l figure, Jim.

1277
01:32:34,093 --> 01:32:36,753
All right. We'll have
a drink or two or ten.

1278
01:32:36,853 --> 01:32:39,954
But you ain't gonna get me drunk
and change my mind.

1279
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:42,055
Of course not.

1280
01:32:48,967 --> 01:32:50,968
Water patrol. Let's go.

1281
01:32:51,048 --> 01:32:53,598
Rise and shine. Up and at 'em.

1282
01:32:54,128 --> 01:32:56,109
Beekeeper, come on. Show a leg.

1283
01:32:56,209 --> 01:32:58,209
Get out of there.

1284
01:32:58,209 --> 01:33:00,510
Thimblerig, come
on. lt's your duty.

1285
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:03,511
lt's your duty.
- You don't have to wake us all.

1286
01:33:03,611 --> 01:33:07,947
l'll get 'em up, Sergeant.
- Thanks, Parson. Thanks.

1287
01:33:09,692 --> 01:33:11,693
Hey.

1288
01:33:11,773 --> 01:33:14,673
Two dollars American
if you take out my patrol.

1289
01:33:14,773 --> 01:33:18,634
Two dollars? This morning
l wouldn't take your patrol for ten.

1290
01:33:18,734 --> 01:33:21,965
l would.
- Got yourself a deal, Scotty.

1291
01:33:26,936 --> 01:33:30,677
Well, Davy, it looks
like you done it again.

1292
01:33:31,937 --> 01:33:33,938
lt do.

1293
01:33:34,898 --> 01:33:38,369
And Bowie?
- Looked like a tie to me.

1294
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:46,181
Your duty.

1295
01:34:14,627 --> 01:34:17,448
Good morning, Colonel.
He's still sleepin'.

1296
01:34:17,548 --> 01:34:20,184
l'll take care of that, Jethro.

1297
01:34:25,070 --> 01:34:27,070
Hey.

1298
01:34:32,071 --> 01:34:34,072
Crockett.

1299
01:34:35,072 --> 01:34:37,073
Crockett.

1300
01:34:40,353 --> 01:34:43,974
Crockett, what the devil...
- Good morning, Smitty. Doc.

1301
01:34:44,074 --> 01:34:46,075
Davy.
- Good morning.

1302
01:34:46,515 --> 01:34:48,515
Well.

1303
01:34:48,595 --> 01:34:49,986
You got yourself famous.

1304
01:34:50,086 --> 01:34:52,136
Now when they talk
about Jim Bowie,

1305
01:34:52,236 --> 01:34:53,978
they'll tell about the man that...

1306
01:34:54,078 --> 01:34:55,977
...pulled him out from
under the troops.

1307
01:34:56,077 --> 01:34:57,698
Gee. Will they?

1308
01:34:57,798 --> 01:35:01,138
Jim, the kid wants to know
about that sand bar episode.

1309
01:35:01,238 --> 01:35:03,659
Oh, come on, Crockett.
- That's the truth.

1310
01:35:03,759 --> 01:35:06,002
He's never heard
anything but hearsay.

1311
01:35:06,103 --> 01:35:07,260
Gosh, yes, Mr Bowie.

1312
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:10,286
All the fellas back
home talk about...

1313
01:35:10,387 --> 01:35:11,981
By the way, Smitty...

1314
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:14,676
Say goodbye to Jim.

1315
01:35:16,122 --> 01:35:19,523
Are you going someplace,
Colonel... Jim?

1316
01:35:21,003 --> 01:35:23,120
No.

1317
01:35:23,244 --> 01:35:24,827
No, l'm not goin' noplace.

1318
01:35:24,927 --> 01:35:27,264
That's just Crockett's
idea of a joke.

1319
01:35:27,365 --> 01:35:29,345
Now you get well, Smitty, boy.

1320
01:35:29,445 --> 01:35:31,570
And thanks for your help.

1321
01:35:43,968 --> 01:35:46,989
What are you doin'?
- lt was rumoured we were leavin'.

1322
01:35:47,089 --> 01:35:51,850
l'll tell you when we're leaving.
Get that gear put away.

1323
01:35:53,211 --> 01:35:55,211
Crockett.

1324
01:36:20,417 --> 01:36:22,557
By God, boy. You're bad-tempered.

1325
01:36:22,658 --> 01:36:25,558
Don't you ever try to make
a fool out of me again.

1326
01:36:25,658 --> 01:36:28,039
Once is enough.
- l make up my own mind.

1327
01:36:28,139 --> 01:36:30,604
Never thought otherwise, Jim.

1328
01:36:30,739 --> 01:36:33,210
l was wondering... You
think there'd be...

1329
01:36:33,310 --> 01:36:35,360
...a mouthful of that
corn juice left?

1330
01:36:35,461 --> 01:36:38,681
We could kinda
cut the tar out of our throats.

1331
01:36:38,781 --> 01:36:41,501
That's a great idea, Davy.

1332
01:36:41,622 --> 01:36:43,622
That's a great idea.

1333
01:36:45,863 --> 01:36:48,584
l still say you're bad-tempered.

1334
01:36:57,207 --> 01:36:59,207
Halt. Who goes there?

1335
01:37:00,807 --> 01:37:02,808
Don't shoot, amigo.

1336
01:37:03,688 --> 01:37:05,729
A message for Jim Bowie.

1337
01:37:07,249 --> 01:37:09,249
ln the sombrero.

1338
01:37:16,411 --> 01:37:17,711
Jim.

1339
01:37:17,811 --> 01:37:21,892
Fella says there's a message
in this hat for you.

1340
01:37:24,773 --> 01:37:28,394
Kind of a strange way
to be sending messages, ain't it?

1341
01:37:28,494 --> 01:37:30,644
Yeah.

1342
01:37:30,775 --> 01:37:33,240
Maybe Santa Anna surrendered.

1343
01:38:18,106 --> 01:38:20,106
What is it, Jim?

1344
01:38:23,347 --> 01:38:25,327
l never... knew the night...

1345
01:38:25,427 --> 01:38:27,428
...could be so dark.

1346
01:38:32,069 --> 01:38:34,069
My... my wife...

1347
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:38,710
She...

1348
01:38:39,191 --> 01:38:41,191
She's... dead.

1349
01:38:50,113 --> 01:38:52,154
l lived through it, Jim.

1350
01:38:54,194 --> 01:38:56,195
lt's hard.

1351
01:38:57,515 --> 01:38:59,515
lt was the plague.

1352
01:39:00,716 --> 01:39:02,716
The damn plague.

1353
01:39:04,877 --> 01:39:06,877
Oh, God, dear God.

1354
01:39:16,319 --> 01:39:18,320
Oh, Davy... she...

1355
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:20,760
She was so small.

1356
01:39:21,721 --> 01:39:24,030
So tiny. So very tiny.

1357
01:39:26,362 --> 01:39:30,303
She wanted to stay in Bexar
to be near me, but...

1358
01:39:30,403 --> 01:39:32,868
...l made her go to Coahuila.

1359
01:39:34,124 --> 01:39:36,124
l made her go.

1360
01:39:38,365 --> 01:39:40,365
My man Parson...

1361
01:39:42,526 --> 01:39:44,736
He's a kind of a preacher.

1362
01:39:45,846 --> 01:39:47,847
He keeps sayin'

1363
01:39:49,087 --> 01:39:51,298
little do we mortals know.

1364
01:39:58,689 --> 01:40:00,690
Hold your head up, Jim.

1365
01:40:05,011 --> 01:40:06,311
Colonel Bowie...

1366
01:40:06,411 --> 01:40:09,312
You've had a communication
from outside these walls.

1367
01:40:09,412 --> 01:40:11,392
This is against my orders.

1368
01:40:11,492 --> 01:40:14,468
What information
have you received?

1369
01:40:15,933 --> 01:40:18,229
Bowie, hand me that letter.

1370
01:40:23,135 --> 01:40:25,411
You may die tonight.

1371
01:40:26,576 --> 01:40:28,576
That little lady, Jim.

1372
01:40:29,297 --> 01:40:31,297
She won't like it.

1373
01:41:07,746 --> 01:41:09,746
Colonel Bowie...

1374
01:41:10,146 --> 01:41:13,632
Please accept
my most profound sympathy...

1375
01:41:14,347 --> 01:41:19,278
...and my regret for having
disturbed you at such a moment.

1376
01:41:19,908 --> 01:41:23,469
This in no way impairs
your right to call...

1377
01:41:23,569 --> 01:41:27,395
...me on the field of
honour at a later date.

1378
01:41:32,631 --> 01:41:36,202
But l wish to express
my sorrow for you...

1379
01:41:36,792 --> 01:41:42,064
...and present my apology for
being such a boor at such a time.

1380
01:41:43,354 --> 01:41:45,663
Travis...

1381
01:41:45,794 --> 01:41:48,090
You can't help bein' you...

1382
01:41:49,955 --> 01:41:52,421
...and l can't help bein' me.

1383
01:42:17,457 --> 01:42:22,198
What's that all about, Sergeant?
- 32 cases hospitalised today, sir.

1384
01:42:22,298 --> 01:42:26,039
Well... Tell 'em to move over
after last night's party...

1385
01:42:26,139 --> 01:42:28,860
Oh, no, sir. Women and children.

1386
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:32,380
Another officers' call.

1387
01:42:33,781 --> 01:42:36,081
See for yourself. lt's all like that.

1388
01:42:36,181 --> 01:42:38,182
Sir.

1389
01:42:38,302 --> 01:42:40,302
Gentlemen.

1390
01:42:41,263 --> 01:42:44,083
Doctor.
- lt's as simple as this, gentlemen.

1391
01:42:44,183 --> 01:42:47,164
l had 32 cases
of mild dysentery this morning.

1392
01:42:47,264 --> 01:42:49,549
l tested the salt pork
barrel the rations...

1393
01:42:49,650 --> 01:42:51,245
...were issued from. lt's tainted.

1394
01:42:51,345 --> 01:42:53,685
So is every other barrel
in the warehouse.

1395
01:42:53,785 --> 01:42:54,886
Sergeant.

1396
01:42:54,986 --> 01:42:57,126
Barring the pork, l figure we have...

1397
01:42:57,226 --> 01:43:02,327
...three or four days' full rations
to serve to the garrison.

1398
01:43:03,188 --> 01:43:05,688
You see the dilemma, gentlemen.

1399
01:43:05,788 --> 01:43:07,809
We are almost out of food.

1400
01:43:07,909 --> 01:43:11,890
However, Santa Anna does not
suffer under the same handicap.

1401
01:43:11,990 --> 01:43:14,490
Therefore our course is obvious.

1402
01:43:14,590 --> 01:43:16,591
lf you'll follow me.

1403
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:59,609
l can think of more
comfortable places...

1404
01:43:59,709 --> 01:44:00,981
...to watch that show from.

1405
01:44:01,081 --> 01:44:03,082
Quiet.

1406
01:44:24,807 --> 01:44:26,807
Dick.

1407
01:44:26,887 --> 01:44:28,888
Yes, sir?

1408
01:44:31,128 --> 01:44:33,594
lt's a half-hour to daybreak.

1409
01:44:33,729 --> 01:44:35,709
Have your men stand to horse.

1410
01:44:35,809 --> 01:44:37,810
Yes, sir.

1411
01:46:21,434 --> 01:46:23,435
The night herders.

1412
01:46:23,515 --> 01:46:25,515
Two to each one of 'em.

1413
01:46:25,595 --> 01:46:28,576
Don't miss.
There'll be a lot of hungry kids.

1414
01:46:28,676 --> 01:46:30,676
Take 'em.

1415
01:46:30,757 --> 01:46:32,873
Smitty.

1416
01:46:34,877 --> 01:46:37,618
Grab a horse off that picket line
for Smitty.

1417
01:46:37,718 --> 01:46:39,719
Get a good one.

1418
01:46:39,799 --> 01:46:41,799
Colonel Davy?

1419
01:46:41,799 --> 01:46:44,460
Can l ask you fellas
something face to face?

1420
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:46,560
Sure thing, kid.

1421
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:48,535
Are you really sending me because...

1422
01:46:48,635 --> 01:46:50,421
...l'm a good horseman
like you said?

1423
01:46:50,521 --> 01:46:52,522
As l live and breathe.

1424
01:46:52,522 --> 01:46:54,040
You're smarter than Beekeeper...

1425
01:46:54,140 --> 01:46:55,902
...and you swim better
than the gambler.

1426
01:46:56,002 --> 01:46:57,763
lt ain't that you don't think l'd be...

1427
01:46:57,863 --> 01:46:59,623
...worth my salt when
the fighting starts?

1428
01:46:59,723 --> 01:47:01,824
Smitty, let me tell you something.

1429
01:47:01,924 --> 01:47:04,485
Of all the men in this
outfit, l'd pick you...

1430
01:47:04,585 --> 01:47:06,465
...to side me if the goin' was rough.

1431
01:47:06,565 --> 01:47:08,565
You see?
- Gee.

1432
01:47:09,166 --> 01:47:11,166
Get on this horse.

1433
01:47:14,887 --> 01:47:17,467
There's nothing out there,
kid, but dark.

1434
01:47:17,568 --> 01:47:19,568
Good luck, Smitty.

1435
01:47:24,489 --> 01:47:27,470
lt'll take him quite a few days
to get to Houston.

1436
01:47:27,570 --> 01:47:30,563
That's what l figured.

1437
01:47:43,574 --> 01:47:45,714
The south side's all taken care of.

1438
01:47:45,814 --> 01:47:47,815
Get a horse.

1439
01:47:49,975 --> 01:47:52,186
Now all we can do is wait.

1440
01:47:53,016 --> 01:47:55,056
That's the hardest part.

1441
01:47:55,096 --> 01:47:57,097
lt sure is.

1442
01:47:59,617 --> 01:48:02,371
Column halt.

1443
01:48:03,938 --> 01:48:05,939
Carry on, Dick.

1444
01:48:06,019 --> 01:48:07,999
Good luck.
- Thank you, Will.

1445
01:48:08,099 --> 01:48:10,534
Best of luck, Dickinson.

1446
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:12,662
Forward, yo-ho.

1447
01:48:31,956 --> 01:48:36,720
lf they don't shoot pretty quick,
we've got to go anyway.

1448
01:48:47,448 --> 01:48:49,599
Let's take 'em.

1449
01:50:08,709 --> 01:50:10,711
Hold your fire.

1450
01:50:11,831 --> 01:50:13,092
Hold your fire.

1451
01:50:13,192 --> 01:50:15,194
Pick your targets.

1452
01:50:15,274 --> 01:50:16,815
Fire.

1453
01:50:16,915 --> 01:50:18,917
Fire at will.

1454
01:50:28,124 --> 01:50:30,125
Second rank, fire.

1455
01:50:30,245 --> 01:50:32,522
Fall back. Fall back.

1456
01:50:37,346 --> 01:50:39,347
Fall back.

1457
01:51:01,324 --> 01:51:02,425
Fire.

1458
01:51:02,525 --> 01:51:04,026
Fall back.

1459
01:51:04,126 --> 01:51:05,547
Second rank.

1460
01:51:05,647 --> 01:51:07,958
Fire.

1461
01:51:08,089 --> 01:51:10,090
Fall back.

1462
01:51:12,292 --> 01:51:14,294
Third rank.

1463
01:51:14,374 --> 01:51:15,995
Ready?

1464
01:51:16,095 --> 01:51:18,096
Fire.

1465
01:51:26,022 --> 01:51:28,024
Cease fire.

1466
01:51:37,551 --> 01:51:39,553
Close the gate.

1467
01:51:39,633 --> 01:51:41,943
There's one thing for sure.

1468
01:51:42,074 --> 01:51:44,056
He's a bearcat for nerve.

1469
01:51:44,156 --> 01:51:46,158
l'm grateful for that.

1470
01:51:46,238 --> 01:51:50,181
l'd hate to look at a coward
over a duellin' pistol.

1471
01:51:50,281 --> 01:51:54,464
You're not much for this forgive
and forget business, are you, Jim?

1472
01:51:54,564 --> 01:51:56,565
No.

1473
01:52:15,019 --> 01:52:17,021
Beef for supper.

1474
01:52:17,101 --> 01:52:19,102
Yes, sir.

1475
01:52:23,506 --> 01:52:26,368
Hog never rightly
could pass for meat.

1476
01:52:26,468 --> 01:52:28,469
But beef.

1477
01:52:37,651 --> 01:52:39,962
The big he-bull himself.

1478
01:52:40,093 --> 01:52:42,131
Let's go.

1479
01:52:42,255 --> 01:52:44,256
Ladies to cover.

1480
01:52:44,256 --> 01:52:46,772
Men to your posts.

1481
01:53:16,681 --> 01:53:18,662
Captain Dickinson.
- Yes, sir.

1482
01:53:18,762 --> 01:53:22,105
Order all men fed in relays.
Full issue of ammunition.

1483
01:53:22,205 --> 01:53:24,207
Yes, sir.

1484
01:53:31,092 --> 01:53:33,954
That's the best-dressed
army l ever saw.

1485
01:53:34,054 --> 01:53:36,556
Fancy clothes don't
make a fightin' man.

1486
01:53:36,656 --> 01:53:39,678
They're just off two years
puttin' down revolts.

1487
01:53:39,778 --> 01:53:41,780
They're fightin' men.

1488
01:54:18,487 --> 01:54:20,412
Generalissimo Santa
Anna has just...

1489
01:54:20,512 --> 01:54:22,711
...arrived with the main
body of his army...

1490
01:54:22,811 --> 01:54:24,792
...and has only
now become aware...

1491
01:54:24,892 --> 01:54:27,634
...that there are women
and children in the mission.

1492
01:54:27,734 --> 01:54:30,517
He wishes that the ladies
receive his apologies...

1493
01:54:30,617 --> 01:54:33,479
...and be informed he has
never attacked a position...

1494
01:54:33,579 --> 01:54:36,441
...without the enemy
being given the opportunity...

1495
01:54:36,541 --> 01:54:38,563
...to evacuate women and children.

1496
01:54:38,663 --> 01:54:41,025
According, you have
one hour in which...

1497
01:54:41,126 --> 01:54:43,126
...to evacuate these
noncombatants...

1498
01:54:43,226 --> 01:54:45,808
...who will be provided
with transport...

1499
01:54:45,908 --> 01:54:49,051
...to proceed to such destination
as is their choice.

1500
01:54:49,151 --> 01:54:52,413
Signed: Antonio López
de Santa Anna, ruler of Mexico.

1501
01:54:52,513 --> 01:54:54,515
Your answer?

1502
01:54:58,998 --> 01:55:02,020
My compliments to the general
for his gallantry.

1503
01:55:02,120 --> 01:55:05,098
We will evacuate
our noncombatants.

1504
01:55:17,332 --> 01:55:20,114
Single men will remain
at their posts.

1505
01:55:20,214 --> 01:55:24,722
Married men will arrange
transport for their families.

1506
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:58,193
Sue, you'd better hurry.
- She won't go.

1507
01:55:58,323 --> 01:56:02,426
Save your breath, Will.
Your ever so persuasive breath.

1508
01:56:02,526 --> 01:56:04,527
All right, say it.

1509
01:56:04,608 --> 01:56:07,430
lt's a sorry man
that can't make his wife obey.

1510
01:56:07,530 --> 01:56:10,512
You seem to forget, Dick,
that l too am married.

1511
01:56:10,612 --> 01:56:13,354
l've got to do what l think
is the right thing.

1512
01:56:13,454 --> 01:56:16,637
l'm a soldier's wife.
My child is a soldier's child.

1513
01:56:16,737 --> 01:56:18,738
We'll stay.

1514
01:56:18,818 --> 01:56:20,970
Very well, Sue.

1515
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:23,101
Dick.

1516
01:56:23,182 --> 01:56:25,183
Don't be angry with me.

1517
01:56:25,263 --> 01:56:27,265
l'm not angry.

1518
01:56:27,345 --> 01:56:29,346
l'm proud.

1519
01:56:32,629 --> 01:56:35,521
Dick, take your patrol.
- Yes, sir.

1520
01:56:38,713 --> 01:56:41,605
Married men, return to your posts.

1521
01:56:41,716 --> 01:56:43,717
Open the gate.

1522
01:56:43,797 --> 01:56:45,799
Captain Dickinson.

1523
01:56:45,879 --> 01:56:47,880
Escort. Forward.

1524
01:56:57,167 --> 01:56:59,649
Ma'am, l ain't got no woman to say...

1525
01:56:59,749 --> 01:57:02,231
...goodbye to. Could
l tell you goodbye?

1526
01:57:02,331 --> 01:57:04,333
Surely.

1527
01:57:05,213 --> 01:57:07,215
Get up, boy.

1528
01:57:11,298 --> 01:57:13,299
Jocko, Nell.

1529
01:57:13,339 --> 01:57:15,341
lt's time.

1530
01:57:34,675 --> 01:57:37,568
Go on, Jocko. Do the best you can.

1531
01:57:51,528 --> 01:57:53,530
l can't.

1532
01:57:57,973 --> 01:57:59,975
l can't.

1533
01:58:04,018 --> 01:58:05,999
l just can't do it, fellas.

1534
01:58:06,099 --> 01:58:08,101
Colonel Bowie.

1535
01:58:09,061 --> 01:58:11,163
This is a request and not an order.

1536
01:58:11,263 --> 01:58:14,445
But l suggest that,
as desperate as our needs are,

1537
01:58:14,546 --> 01:58:17,863
that family's needs
are more desperate.

1538
01:58:19,189 --> 01:58:23,532
Get in that line, Jocko,
and move out with your people.

1539
01:58:23,632 --> 01:58:25,634
You can see how it is.

1540
01:58:25,714 --> 01:58:27,695
lt's more than a man can bear.

1541
01:58:27,796 --> 01:58:30,589
She's never said a word
of pity for herself...

1542
01:58:30,689 --> 01:58:32,739
...in the ten years she's been blind.

1543
01:58:32,839 --> 01:58:35,501
Will Travis.
Just who do you think you are?

1544
01:58:35,601 --> 01:58:38,621
Mrs Robertson, l can
assure you that no...

1545
01:58:38,721 --> 01:58:41,666
...blame will attach
itself to your husband.

1546
01:58:41,766 --> 01:58:45,549
Get movin', Jocko, or l'll help you
along with the toe of my boot.

1547
01:58:45,649 --> 01:58:48,831
Shut up, Jim Bowie.
And you and Travis listen close.

1548
01:58:48,932 --> 01:58:51,099
My man ain't goin' out.
He's just as much...

1549
01:58:51,199 --> 01:58:53,115
...a man as either one
of you. Maybe more.

1550
01:58:53,215 --> 01:58:55,476
ln spite of he ain't
rich like you, Jim,

1551
01:58:55,577 --> 01:58:57,838
or fancy educated like
you, Will Travis.

1552
01:58:57,938 --> 01:59:00,480
Now, Jocko, you get
back up on that wall.

1553
01:59:00,580 --> 01:59:04,083
Cos you're just as good as
any man that ever trod leather.

1554
01:59:04,183 --> 01:59:06,185
And it's your right.

1555
01:59:06,265 --> 01:59:08,836
And l can't see, but
l'm just as good...

1556
01:59:08,936 --> 01:59:10,328
...as any woman in Texas.

1557
01:59:10,428 --> 01:59:13,410
And it's my right to
go and leave you.

1558
01:59:13,510 --> 01:59:15,474
Now we've cuddled nice and said...

1559
01:59:15,574 --> 01:59:17,893
...all our goodbyes,
but l'll say it again.

1560
01:59:17,993 --> 01:59:19,975
We'd be fools not to face it.

1561
01:59:20,075 --> 01:59:23,217
You're likely to go and get
yourself killed in this battle.

1562
01:59:23,317 --> 01:59:26,860
l don't know what you're going
to say at the gates of heaven,

1563
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:29,513
but l'm going to say
no woman ever lived...

1564
01:59:29,613 --> 01:59:31,864
...had herself a better
husband than you.

1565
01:59:31,964 --> 01:59:33,965
Now go on.

1566
01:59:45,814 --> 01:59:47,932
Hip. Hip.
- Hooray.

1567
01:59:48,657 --> 01:59:50,658
Hip. Hip.
- Hooray.

1568
01:59:50,778 --> 01:59:53,499
Hip. Hip.
- Hooray.

1569
02:00:35,980 --> 02:00:37,982
Captain Dickinson.

1570
02:00:39,063 --> 02:00:40,444
Yes, sir.

1571
02:00:40,544 --> 02:00:43,166
Have the Doctor set up
the hospital in the chapel.

1572
02:00:43,266 --> 02:00:46,248
You will take charge
of Battery No.4.

1573
02:00:46,348 --> 02:00:48,350
Yes, sir.

1574
02:01:54,119 --> 02:01:56,121
Hold your fire.

1575
02:01:56,361 --> 02:01:58,362
Hold your fire.

1576
02:02:03,086 --> 02:02:05,087
Take 'em.

1577
02:02:29,466 --> 02:02:31,507
Straight frontal attack.

1578
02:02:31,547 --> 02:02:33,624
We need more men up here.

1579
02:02:33,724 --> 02:02:36,957
l'll get some strength
from Dickinson.

1580
02:02:53,684 --> 02:02:55,961
North wall. Hurry it up.

1581
02:02:59,649 --> 02:03:02,211
Who is it?
- lt's the Parson.

1582
02:03:47,925 --> 02:03:49,927
Hold your fire.

1583
02:03:50,007 --> 02:03:53,046
Hold your fire. They're retiring.

1584
02:04:11,798 --> 02:04:13,780
See did any of our boys get hurt.

1585
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:19,516
l'll be below gettin' washed on
the outside and wet down inside.

1586
02:04:19,644 --> 02:04:21,645
We've been lucky today.

1587
02:04:25,008 --> 02:04:27,010
Check the damage.

1588
02:04:27,090 --> 02:04:29,642
Officers' call in ten minutes.

1589
02:04:31,253 --> 02:04:33,254
Bring on another.

1590
02:05:11,283 --> 02:05:14,260
Sure killed many
a brave man today.

1591
02:05:15,286 --> 02:05:17,923
lt's funny. l was proud of 'em.

1592
02:05:18,809 --> 02:05:22,807
Even while l was killin' 'em
l was proud of 'em.

1593
02:05:23,372 --> 02:05:26,795
Speaks well for men
that so many ain't afraid to die...

1594
02:05:26,895 --> 02:05:30,647
...because they think
right's on their side.

1595
02:05:30,747 --> 02:05:32,748
Speaks well.

1596
02:05:39,985 --> 02:05:43,007
Post this area, Lightfoot.
- lt's already done.

1597
02:05:43,107 --> 02:05:45,108
All right, Sergeant.

1598
02:05:45,189 --> 02:05:47,190
Report.
- 50 casualties.

1599
02:05:47,270 --> 02:05:49,832
28 dead, 22 wounded.

1600
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:52,070
Morale... high.

1601
02:05:52,194 --> 02:05:54,119
Morale ain't gonna help us much...

1602
02:05:54,219 --> 02:05:56,377
...if Fannin don't
get here... and quick.

1603
02:05:56,477 --> 02:05:58,479
Doc.
- Quit squawking.

1604
02:05:58,559 --> 02:06:00,354
You oughta be laying
on your back.

1605
02:06:00,454 --> 02:06:01,381
You'll never walk.

1606
02:06:01,481 --> 02:06:03,527
Santa Anna didn't
have much respect...

1607
02:06:03,627 --> 02:06:05,344
...for us today, and he got burned.

1608
02:06:05,444 --> 02:06:07,164
Now he's gonna be comin' at us...

1609
02:06:07,264 --> 02:06:09,307
...with a battle plan
from all four sides.

1610
02:06:09,407 --> 02:06:11,314
We already been cut
down by a third.

1611
02:06:11,414 --> 02:06:13,430
How long do you think
we can hold out?

1612
02:06:13,530 --> 02:06:15,832
Santa Anna won't
attack again today.

1613
02:06:15,932 --> 02:06:18,674
He'll clear the field of
all the dead and wounded.

1614
02:06:18,774 --> 02:06:21,796
Fannin will be here by tomorrow,
even without a forced march.

1615
02:06:21,896 --> 02:06:23,898
With his 500 men...

1616
02:06:23,978 --> 02:06:26,039
...we can hold this fort for a month.

1617
02:06:26,139 --> 02:06:28,721
500? l thought it was a thousand.

1618
02:06:28,821 --> 02:06:32,499
500.
- Bonham's approaching, sir.

1619
02:06:32,624 --> 02:06:35,858
Good. Fannin should
be close behind.

1620
02:06:47,796 --> 02:06:49,417
Well?

1621
02:06:49,517 --> 02:06:51,659
Colonel Fannin isn't comin'.

1622
02:06:51,759 --> 02:06:54,481
His men were
ambushed. Murdered.

1623
02:06:55,281 --> 02:06:57,323
There won't be any help.

1624
02:07:00,685 --> 02:07:04,513
Have all volunteers
assembled in the compound.

1625
02:07:09,612 --> 02:07:10,793
Well, that's it.

1626
02:07:10,893 --> 02:07:13,795
l'm taking my men out.
Cut through to the North.

1627
02:07:13,895 --> 02:07:15,897
You comin'?

1628
02:07:20,140 --> 02:07:23,543
lt seems like the
better part of valour.

1629
02:07:51,204 --> 02:07:53,205
Men...

1630
02:07:53,886 --> 02:07:56,548
Jim Bonham has brought
news as sad as death.

1631
02:07:56,648 --> 02:08:00,405
Colonel Fannin
has been ambushed.

1632
02:08:00,531 --> 02:08:03,491
We can expect no help.

1633
02:08:03,613 --> 02:08:06,004
l stay here with my command.

1634
02:08:07,456 --> 02:08:11,879
But any of you who wish to
may leave with all honour.

1635
02:08:12,259 --> 02:08:16,087
Failing reinforcements,
the Alamo cannot hold.

1636
02:08:17,423 --> 02:08:20,316
But do not go with
heads hung low.

1637
02:08:21,186 --> 02:08:24,249
No man can criticise
your behaviour.

1638
02:08:25,389 --> 02:08:27,541
Here on these ramparts...

1639
02:08:29,032 --> 02:08:33,135
...you have bought a priceless
ten days of time for Houston.

1640
02:08:33,235 --> 02:08:35,702
You have bled the enemy army.

1641
02:08:36,278 --> 02:08:39,085
You are brave and noble soldiers.

1642
02:08:40,401 --> 02:08:42,402
Open the gate.

1643
02:08:45,244 --> 02:08:47,246
May God bless you.

1644
02:10:42,052 --> 02:10:44,054
Close the gate.

1645
02:11:00,666 --> 02:11:02,367
Hold up there, bub.

1646
02:11:02,467 --> 02:11:05,209
You're in dangerous territory.
Where you headin'?

1647
02:11:05,309 --> 02:11:07,433
l'm lookin' for
General Sam Houston.

1648
02:11:07,533 --> 02:11:08,812
Got a message for him.

1649
02:11:08,912 --> 02:11:11,213
Well, you've come
to the right place.

1650
02:11:11,314 --> 02:11:14,121
Corporal of the guard. Post No.3.

1651
02:11:15,277 --> 02:11:17,778
What is it?
- He wants to see General Sam.

1652
02:11:17,878 --> 02:11:19,880
Come on, bub.

1653
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:49,567
The lad has a message
for the general.

1654
02:11:49,667 --> 02:11:50,803
Yes, sir.

1655
02:11:50,903 --> 02:11:53,130
You'd better get down,
and get yourself...

1656
02:11:53,230 --> 02:11:54,806
...some beans and a little sleep.

1657
02:11:54,906 --> 02:11:56,087
No, sir.

1658
02:11:56,187 --> 02:11:58,995
l've gotta get back to the Alamo.

1659
02:12:33,135 --> 02:12:35,597
Yesterday l read you
Fannin's message...

1660
02:12:35,697 --> 02:12:39,695
...telling us he cannot reach
the Alamo in time.

1661
02:12:40,060 --> 02:12:43,499
Today l have this...
from the Alamo.

1662
02:12:45,985 --> 02:12:47,986
They are surrounded...

1663
02:12:48,067 --> 02:12:50,278
...and we can't help them.

1664
02:12:51,509 --> 02:12:53,511
Now, tomorrow,

1665
02:12:53,591 --> 02:12:57,826
when your recruits
start to whine and bellyache,

1666
02:13:00,036 --> 02:13:08,040
you tell them that
185 of their friends,

1667
02:13:08,162 --> 02:13:12,795
neighbours, fellow Texicans,

1668
02:13:12,925 --> 02:13:17,589
are holed up in a crumbling adobe
church down on the Rio Bravo...

1669
02:13:17,689 --> 02:13:20,922
...buying them this precious time.

1670
02:13:28,577 --> 02:13:30,579
l hope they remember.

1671
02:13:32,980 --> 02:13:34,982
l hope Texas remembers.

1672
02:14:17,413 --> 02:14:21,836
lt may not be as comfortable,
but it's safer in here.

1673
02:14:23,257 --> 02:14:25,259
He's had a hard day.

1674
02:14:26,780 --> 02:14:28,360
Will...

1675
02:14:28,460 --> 02:14:30,461
...l'm sorry.

1676
02:14:30,541 --> 02:14:33,010
What for?

1677
02:14:33,142 --> 02:14:36,123
l guess l've said some
pretty rude things to you.

1678
02:14:36,223 --> 02:14:38,773
Well, at least, l thought 'em.

1679
02:14:40,344 --> 02:14:42,324
You're a wonderful woman, Sue.

1680
02:14:42,424 --> 02:14:44,425
Forget it.

1681
02:14:44,505 --> 02:14:47,657
Dick, stay here as long as you can.

1682
02:14:47,786 --> 02:14:50,932
Probably won't need
you till morning.

1683
02:14:52,947 --> 02:14:56,603
l've only added to your
worries, haven't l?

1684
02:14:56,628 --> 02:14:59,348
l know l must be very selfish.

1685
02:15:01,110 --> 02:15:05,191
l couldn't think of facing
the world without you.

1686
02:15:43,322 --> 02:15:45,702
What are you thinkin', Davy?

1687
02:15:48,443 --> 02:15:50,444
l'm not thinkin'.

1688
02:15:51,284 --> 02:15:53,285
l'm just rememberin'.

1689
02:15:58,046 --> 02:16:01,627
Well, l sure done a heap of things
l shouldn't have done.

1690
02:16:01,727 --> 02:16:04,108
Seemed urgent at the moment.

1691
02:16:05,808 --> 02:16:08,989
Got myself a heap of
sins to answer for.

1692
02:16:09,089 --> 02:16:11,090
Wish l hadn't did 'em.

1693
02:16:12,010 --> 02:16:14,482
l reckon old Saint
Pete's gonna slam them

1694
02:16:14,582 --> 02:16:16,991
Pearly Gates right
smack-dab in my face.

1695
02:16:17,091 --> 02:16:19,072
There ain't no Pearly Gates.

1696
02:16:19,172 --> 02:16:23,313
When you're dead, you're meat for
the worms. That's all there is to it.

1697
02:16:23,413 --> 02:16:26,154
You don't believe in no afterlife?
No hereafter?

1698
02:16:26,254 --> 02:16:29,315
Tales for children.
Bunkum and bosh.

1699
02:16:29,735 --> 02:16:32,091
l say this.

1700
02:16:32,216 --> 02:16:34,730
l believe.

1701
02:16:34,856 --> 02:16:37,839
l can never find a
way to argue down...

1702
02:16:37,939 --> 02:16:39,678
...you that don't believe.

1703
02:16:39,778 --> 02:16:42,759
But l believe in the
Lord God Almighty,

1704
02:16:42,859 --> 02:16:45,771
all knowing and all forgiving.

1705
02:16:47,100 --> 02:16:51,241
And l believe that good
shall be triumphant in the end...

1706
02:16:51,341 --> 02:16:54,487
...and that evil
shall be vanquished.

1707
02:16:55,022 --> 02:16:57,173
l believe in a hereafter.

1708
02:16:57,303 --> 02:17:01,284
Me, too. l figure a man's
got to believe in those things,

1709
02:17:01,384 --> 02:17:04,725
does he want to believe in
the good things about man.

1710
02:17:04,825 --> 02:17:08,286
About his very own self.
The real good things.

1711
02:17:08,386 --> 02:17:11,424
Like courage and honesty...

1712
02:17:13,267 --> 02:17:15,828
And love.

1713
02:17:17,428 --> 02:17:19,897
Jethro.

1714
02:17:21,149 --> 02:17:23,150
Yes, sir.

1715
02:17:32,313 --> 02:17:35,629
This is somethin' l
promised Mrs Bowie.

1716
02:17:37,554 --> 02:17:39,535
Know what it is?
- No, sir.

1717
02:17:39,635 --> 02:17:41,635
That's your freedom.

1718
02:17:42,956 --> 02:17:44,996
You're a free man, Jeth.

1719
02:17:46,957 --> 02:17:48,957
Thank you, sir.

1720
02:17:49,477 --> 02:17:52,114
You'd better get your
belongings together...

1721
02:17:52,214 --> 02:17:54,179
...and get on over the wall tonight.

1722
02:17:54,279 --> 02:17:58,530
lt's gonna be more than
a little rough around here.

1723
02:18:03,802 --> 02:18:05,802
Good luck, Jeth.

1724
02:18:05,882 --> 02:18:08,033
Thank you, sir.

1725
02:18:08,163 --> 02:18:11,361
Colonel Bowie,
you say l'm a free man?

1726
02:18:11,484 --> 02:18:13,484
That's right.

1727
02:18:13,564 --> 02:18:16,159
Well, if l'm free,

1728
02:18:16,285 --> 02:18:20,026
then l got a right
to decide what l'm gonna do.

1729
02:18:20,126 --> 02:18:24,207
Seems to me that's what
you men are fighting for.

1730
02:18:24,567 --> 02:18:27,640
So l... reckon l'll...

1731
02:18:28,889 --> 02:18:30,889
...l'll stay.

1732
02:19:20,006 --> 02:19:22,007
Look.

1733
02:21:25,242 --> 02:21:27,597
Gentlemen, good luck.

1734
02:21:28,963 --> 02:21:31,343
Get to your battle stations.
