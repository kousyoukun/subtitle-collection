1
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:14,285
General Houston's
arrived, gentlemen.

2
00:03:14,385 --> 00:03:15,382
Refreshments?

3
00:03:15,482 --> 00:03:17,477
Thank you, Doc.

4
00:03:19,911 --> 00:03:22,661
71 cold, windy,
rump-bumping miles...

5
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,922
...since yesterday.

6
00:03:24,021 --> 00:03:27,837
You wouldn't have it
any other way, Lightfoot.

7
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:47,046
Company, stand to.

8
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,874
Attention.

9
00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:53,949
As you are.

10
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:57,449
¡Don Esparza.
- ¡Mi general.

11
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:00,353
General Houston, may l
order the men to bivouac?

12
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:02,737
The forced marches
took it out of them.

13
00:04:02,837 --> 00:04:03,865
Foot soldiers may.

14
00:04:03,965 --> 00:04:06,419
Feed the others, care
for their horses,

15
00:04:06,518 --> 00:04:09,531
and tell them there'll be
another march within the hour.

16
00:04:09,631 --> 00:04:11,287
Yes, sir. Sergeant.

17
00:04:11,387 --> 00:04:12,883
Doctor.
- Sam.

18
00:04:12,983 --> 00:04:14,758
Dickinson.
- General, sir.

19
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:17,303
General, it ain't
none of my business,

20
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:19,587
but you ain't ate since yesterday.

21
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:21,861
l'll sit it on the table here.

22
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,956
Where's Jim Bowie?

23
00:04:24,036 --> 00:04:29,039
When certain people ain't ate,
they're meaner than a bobcat.

24
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:34,650
Mr Dickinson...

25
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,442
...l asked you a question.

26
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:42,671
Where's Jim Bowie?

27
00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:44,746
He's indisposed, sir.

28
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:47,558
By God, if you mean drunk,
you say drunk, sir.

29
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:49,654
He's drunk, sir.

30
00:04:49,734 --> 00:04:52,307
What's your name?
- James Butler Bonham.

31
00:04:52,407 --> 00:04:54,527
ln Travis's command, sir.

32
00:05:01,465 --> 00:05:03,839
Neill, you go north with me.

33
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,511
Colonel Travis will
be in command here.

34
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,993
Major, sir.
- Colonel Travis.

35
00:05:10,124 --> 00:05:13,257
l'll send the commission through.
- Thank you, General.

36
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:15,193
Let me assure you l'll do...

37
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:18,005
We'll dispense with
the amenities. Now...

38
00:05:18,105 --> 00:05:20,998
...l've been given command
of the armies of Texas.

39
00:05:21,098 --> 00:05:24,948
But the fly in the buttermilk is
there ain't no armies in Texas.

40
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:27,462
A few good friends
and some willing men.

41
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:30,575
l'm gonna have to knock
some of those men into an army...

42
00:05:30,674 --> 00:05:32,650
...and to do that l need time.

43
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,087
You people right here
on the real ground...

44
00:05:35,186 --> 00:05:37,079
...are gonna have to
buy me that time.

45
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:39,752
You have to keep Santa Anna
off the back of my neck...

46
00:05:39,852 --> 00:05:41,956
...until l can get in
shape to fight him.

47
00:05:42,056 --> 00:05:43,423
So you're ordering me to...

48
00:05:43,523 --> 00:05:45,688
Dammit. l am ordering
you to command.

49
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:47,893
How and what you do
is your problem.

50
00:05:47,992 --> 00:05:49,968
But, Sam, what about Jim Bowie?

51
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:53,679
Jim Bowie, as Mr Bonham
has informed us, is indisposed.

52
00:05:53,778 --> 00:05:55,953
Yes, sir. But l'd like to point out...

53
00:05:56,053 --> 00:05:59,105
...that Jim Bowie is leading
a hundred volunteers...

54
00:05:59,205 --> 00:06:02,856
...whereas young Travis here
commands less than 30 regulars.

55
00:06:02,956 --> 00:06:04,293
27.

56
00:06:04,393 --> 00:06:07,645
General Houston, l think
we oughta discuss this...

57
00:06:07,745 --> 00:06:11,129
Clear the room. Gentlemen,
l would have...

58
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:15,045
...a word with Mr Travis
if you'll excuse us.

59
00:06:25,102 --> 00:06:29,631
Mr Travis, were you going to
complain to me about Jim Bowie?

60
00:06:29,731 --> 00:06:31,307
Not complain, sir.

61
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:33,622
Of course Jim Bowie's drunk.

62
00:06:33,722 --> 00:06:35,831
He took this town
from General Cos.

63
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:37,053
He fought a battle.

64
00:06:37,153 --> 00:06:39,148
And now he's drunk.

65
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:41,433
Seems kinda natural to me.

66
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:45,384
Or perhaps you
question something...

67
00:06:45,484 --> 00:06:47,189
...other than Bowie's drinking.

68
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:50,461
Are you gonna tell me that he's got
a lot of acreage around here?

69
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:53,015
That he's married into
the Mexican aristocracy?

70
00:06:53,115 --> 00:06:54,092
Yes, sir.

71
00:06:54,192 --> 00:06:56,207
l would trust Jim
Bowie with my life.

72
00:06:56,307 --> 00:06:59,639
More than that, l would trust him
with the lives of my family.

73
00:06:59,738 --> 00:07:01,678
And more than that,
l would trust him...

74
00:07:01,778 --> 00:07:02,871
...with the life of Texas.

75
00:07:02,971 --> 00:07:05,433
Sir.
- That's all, Travis.

76
00:07:05,564 --> 00:07:07,560
Travis.

77
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:13,166
l've never been able to like you.

78
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,750
But you are another
one of the very few...

79
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:18,274
...men l would trust
with the life of Texas.

80
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:20,349
For that, thank you, sir.

81
00:07:20,448 --> 00:07:23,002
And it may very well be...

82
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:26,683
...that that life rests
in your hands now.

83
00:07:50,224 --> 00:07:52,219
Jethro. ls that you?

84
00:07:52,299 --> 00:07:54,274
Yes, sir, General. This is me.

85
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:56,150
How are you still alive?

86
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,067
You had white hair
when l was a boy...

87
00:07:58,167 --> 00:07:59,542
...and now we look the same age.

88
00:07:59,641 --> 00:08:01,098
Yes, sir.

89
00:08:01,198 --> 00:08:06,455
But l've been a temperate and
God-fearing man all my life, sir.

90
00:08:06,664 --> 00:08:09,729
Well, l guess my past is out.

91
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:13,867
Jethro, you tell your Mr Jim
l'm sorry to hear about his illness.

92
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:15,942
l wish him a speedy recovery.

93
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:18,535
And assure him of my
undying affection.

94
00:08:18,635 --> 00:08:19,932
Yes, sir.

95
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:22,326
And, General Sam,
sir, he love you too.

96
00:08:22,426 --> 00:08:23,867
And them words of yours...

97
00:08:23,966 --> 00:08:26,037
...gonna put him right
back on his feet.

98
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:28,591
He got a colic, you know.
- l heard.

99
00:08:28,691 --> 00:08:30,187
ln the stomach.

100
00:08:30,287 --> 00:08:31,903
Stay temperate, old man.

101
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:33,180
Neill.

102
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,275
Column right. Forward.

103
00:08:38,707 --> 00:08:40,702
Take care, men.

104
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,940
You all right, Mr Jim?

105
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,061
Yeah.

106
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:38,141
Sit down, Jeth.

107
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,843
Can l get you something, sir?
- No, no.

108
00:09:50,943 --> 00:09:52,943
You just sit there.

109
00:10:01,705 --> 00:10:03,705
Houston's gone?

110
00:10:03,785 --> 00:10:05,785
Yes, sir.

111
00:10:08,786 --> 00:10:11,858
Come and gone and
me lying drunk.

112
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:24,336
Colonel Travis.
Bowie's approaching.

113
00:10:40,742 --> 00:10:42,742
Halt.

114
00:10:43,622 --> 00:10:45,853
Carry on, sentry.

115
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,023
Recall work parties.

116
00:10:51,103 --> 00:10:53,823
Prepare for flag ceremony.

117
00:10:57,184 --> 00:10:59,858
Detail. Forward... march.

118
00:11:25,909 --> 00:11:29,902
Present... arms.

119
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,786
Order... arms.

120
00:11:39,111 --> 00:11:41,771
We stand here ready
to do our duty,

121
00:11:41,871 --> 00:11:44,677
and cognisant of the will of God.

122
00:11:45,632 --> 00:11:47,632
Captain Dickinson.

123
00:11:47,712 --> 00:11:49,712
Dismiss the ceremony.

124
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,978
And, Captain, inform the men that...

125
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,573
...work details will be
dismissed at 4.30...

126
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,914
...in order that family
men may gather...

127
00:11:57,014 --> 00:11:58,974
...their dependants
within these walls.

128
00:11:59,074 --> 00:12:01,074
Yes, sir.

129
00:12:07,595 --> 00:12:09,575
Lieutenant Blake.
- Yes, sir.

130
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:12,496
You will see to the quartering
of Bowie's volunteers.

131
00:12:12,596 --> 00:12:13,776
Yes, sir.

132
00:12:13,876 --> 00:12:15,876
You men will follow me.

133
00:12:21,837 --> 00:12:25,018
Jeth, Blake'll show you
to our quarters. Set 'em up.

134
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:27,118
Yes, sir.

135
00:12:51,882 --> 00:12:53,882
Colonel Bowie.

136
00:12:54,802 --> 00:12:58,079
Santa Anna's got an
army of 7,000 men.

137
00:13:02,004 --> 00:13:03,184
So?

138
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:07,104
Well, you ain't gonna try to defend
this broken-down church...

139
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,745
...against 7,000 battle-hard troops?

140
00:13:09,845 --> 00:13:11,845
Colonel Bowie.

141
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:15,146
You were drunk at the
last officers' call.

142
00:13:15,246 --> 00:13:18,866
And l would rather postpone
our discussion until the next.

143
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,467
At which time l will
explain my plans...

144
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:26,157
...and give orders for
the implementing of those plans.

145
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:51,246
Hey, Jim.

146
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:53,887
Why do we have to work like this?

147
00:13:53,987 --> 00:13:56,727
l volunteered to fight,
not to build no fort.

148
00:13:56,827 --> 00:13:58,887
How come we have
to work like this?

149
00:13:58,987 --> 00:14:01,968
Because old Sam told Travis,
Travis told me,

150
00:14:02,068 --> 00:14:04,068
and l'm telling you.

151
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:08,294
Somebody's comin'
hellbent for leather,

152
00:14:08,394 --> 00:14:10,774
sinking spurs at every jump.

153
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:13,430
Halt.

154
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,210
Corporal of the guard.

155
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,310
Post No.1.

156
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:23,611
No civilians may enter the fort,
Señor Seguin. l'm sorry.

157
00:14:23,711 --> 00:14:26,372
Juan. Silverio.
Let 'em through, Dick.

158
00:14:26,472 --> 00:14:28,472
Captain Dickinson.

159
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:29,772
Yes, sir.

160
00:14:29,872 --> 00:14:32,683
Come to my office,
please, Captain.

161
00:14:32,783 --> 00:14:34,783
Yes, sir.

162
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:43,134
Good afternoon, Colonel Travis.
We have news of Santa Anna.

163
00:14:43,234 --> 00:14:46,055
My son and l have...
- Good day, Señor Seguin.

164
00:14:46,155 --> 00:14:47,986
Señor, even though you're...

165
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:50,455
...the alcalde of
San Antonio de Bexar,

166
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:53,896
it does not exempt you
from military prohibitions.

167
00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:56,976
This establishment is
closed to all civilians.

168
00:14:57,076 --> 00:14:59,057
l'm very sorry, Colonel Travis.

169
00:14:59,157 --> 00:15:02,497
Had l known your restrictions
applied to me and my family, sir...

170
00:15:02,597 --> 00:15:04,116
Now, wait a minute, Travis.

171
00:15:04,216 --> 00:15:06,258
The Seguins have
news of Santa Anna.

172
00:15:06,358 --> 00:15:09,378
We have a dozen rumours a day.
- You can't just...

173
00:15:09,478 --> 00:15:11,459
Por favor, Juan, tell him.

174
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:13,939
Colonel, the lndians of San Blas...

175
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,980
...sent couriers to the vaqueros of...

176
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,180
...my properties along
the Sangre de Cristo.

177
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,700
They say many soldiers crossed
the Baja Diablo two days ago.

178
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,461
That puts 'em a lot closer
than you thought.

179
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:28,501
The lndians guessed the number
of troops at over 5,000.

180
00:15:28,601 --> 00:15:30,571
There are also large numbers of...

181
00:15:30,671 --> 00:15:32,702
...mounted soldiers
and supply trains.

182
00:15:32,802 --> 00:15:34,971
Also, lower down on
the Baja Diablo...

183
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:37,182
...another party of
lndians saw signs...

184
00:15:37,282 --> 00:15:40,543
...of shod horses crossing a ford.
- l'm sorry, Señor Seguin.

185
00:15:40,643 --> 00:15:44,664
As a civilian, you cannot realise
how worthless this information is.

186
00:15:44,764 --> 00:15:46,824
''Some lndian told
some vaqueros..."

187
00:15:46,924 --> 00:15:48,864
Anyway, thank you, sir. Good day.

188
00:15:48,964 --> 00:15:51,745
You know the Seguins
are absolutely reliable.

189
00:15:51,845 --> 00:15:53,082
lf you'll excuse me.

190
00:15:53,182 --> 00:15:55,385
l meant no personal
offence, señor.

191
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:58,506
But l cannot make a plan
based on third-hand rumours.

192
00:15:58,606 --> 00:16:02,599
l do not take personal affront,
Colonel Travis,

193
00:16:02,726 --> 00:16:05,363
else l should be forced to act...

194
00:16:05,463 --> 00:16:08,948
...other than to simply
bid you good day.

195
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:22,264
You're a damn fool, Travis.

196
00:17:01,816 --> 00:17:03,941
A true gentleman, Seguin.

197
00:17:06,256 --> 00:17:08,637
l dislike being rude to him.

198
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:13,997
Even allowing for exaggeration,

199
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:17,358
Santa Anna must have
crossed the Baja in strength.

200
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,583
But l had to do it, Dick.

201
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:23,117
l'd say we have two or at best...

202
00:17:23,217 --> 00:17:25,799
...three days before
we see his banners.

203
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:27,900
The men were listening.

204
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,528
And l can't let that
rabble know how weak...

205
00:17:31,628 --> 00:17:34,859
...we are and how
strong the enemy is.

206
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:39,491
You couldn't do that?
- No, l couldn't.

207
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:43,772
My honest and truthful
and plain-spoken friend.

208
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,082
You could, perhaps, but l couldn't.

209
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:48,163
Now, take a look at this.

210
00:17:48,263 --> 00:17:50,243
This oblique rampart here...

211
00:17:50,343 --> 00:17:52,493
Well, have sense,
Dick. Why should...

212
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:54,804
...those men stay if
they knew the truth?

213
00:17:54,904 --> 00:17:56,884
lt's different for Bowie, of course.

214
00:17:56,984 --> 00:18:00,405
He's got a big stake in Texas.
A couple of million acres, l hear.

215
00:18:00,505 --> 00:18:02,307
Some of those men haven't got...

216
00:18:02,407 --> 00:18:04,325
Have you got any dollars or acres?

217
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:08,506
l've got an extra suit of clothes.
You know that.

218
00:18:17,878 --> 00:18:20,109
Boy. So that's it.

219
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:22,239
San Antonio de Bexar.

220
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:24,459
lt means Saint Anthony in English.

221
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,705
The colonel speaks
Spanish, you know.

222
00:18:33,801 --> 00:18:35,841
Are you gonna pray, sir?

223
00:18:37,441 --> 00:18:39,442
But why, sir?

224
00:18:39,522 --> 00:18:42,542
l mean, there wasn't
no doubt we'd find her.

225
00:18:42,642 --> 00:18:45,052
The colonel just wasn't
sure which one...

226
00:18:45,152 --> 00:18:47,623
...of these here creeks
was the shortest cut.

227
00:18:47,723 --> 00:18:50,143
He ain't been here
in nigh 1 5 years.

228
00:18:50,243 --> 00:18:52,224
Better make the signal, boy.

229
00:18:52,324 --> 00:18:54,324
Yes, sir.

230
00:18:54,404 --> 00:18:56,384
l hope this powder ain't damp.

231
00:18:56,484 --> 00:18:57,970
You don't take it wrong...

232
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,265
...l ask you all these
questions, Parson?

233
00:19:00,365 --> 00:19:03,145
No, boy, that's how
you learn. Asking.

234
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:05,246
Yes, sir.

235
00:19:05,326 --> 00:19:09,406
So many times every day
you stop and give thanks.

236
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:13,267
Mostly l can't catch on to what
you're thanking the Lord for.

237
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:15,427
l mean, there's nothin' special.

238
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:17,948
l give thanks for the
time and the place.

239
00:19:18,048 --> 00:19:20,028
The time and place, Parson?

240
00:19:20,128 --> 00:19:23,828
A time to live and a place to die.
That's all any man gets.

241
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:26,284
No more, no less.

242
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:29,287
Fire the signal, boy.
- Yes, sir.

243
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:44,187
Must be Parson and the boy.

244
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:48,292
Think so.

245
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:33,759
Well, there she be, Colonel.

246
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,920
After 20 days of hard ridin'.

247
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,538
Are we gonna have to learn...

248
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:39,480
...the lingo they
use down here, Davy?

249
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,401
Where do we go, Davy?
To the town or to the fort?

250
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:44,801
There's no fort. lt's an old mission.

251
00:20:44,901 --> 00:20:49,402
You better take a better look.
A lot of people movin' in there.

252
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:52,282
Them guns don't give it
no mission look to me.

253
00:20:52,382 --> 00:20:54,382
Colonel...

254
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:59,218
What do C-A-N-T-l-N-A spell?

255
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:01,944
Cantina. Do it mean
what l think it do?

256
00:21:02,044 --> 00:21:03,044
lt do.

257
00:21:03,144 --> 00:21:07,774
lt means out of these deerskins
and into our foofaraw.

258
00:21:21,787 --> 00:21:23,787
Hey, you got my coat.

259
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:37,727
Hey, Pedro.

260
00:21:37,827 --> 00:21:39,807
Hand me down that guitar.

261
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:43,408
Now l want you folks to all
clump in here close together.

262
00:21:43,508 --> 00:21:46,088
l want you Texicans
to open up your ears...

263
00:21:46,188 --> 00:21:49,674
...and listen to a
little pure Tennessee.

264
00:21:51,149 --> 00:21:52,769
Here's to the ladies...

265
00:21:52,869 --> 00:21:54,870
...l love 'em all

266
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:58,465
Here's to the ones l recall

267
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,591
Here's to the ladies

268
00:22:00,671 --> 00:22:02,531
Married or free

269
00:22:02,631 --> 00:22:05,748
They all look pretty good to me

270
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:07,652
The big and small ones

271
00:22:07,752 --> 00:22:09,372
The short and tall ones

272
00:22:09,472 --> 00:22:11,472
Each one a lovely...

273
00:22:11,552 --> 00:22:13,553
Halt.

274
00:22:14,553 --> 00:22:16,013
Here's to the ladies...

275
00:22:16,113 --> 00:22:18,707
...l love the ladies...

276
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,254
Captain Dickinson,
split your patrol.

277
00:22:21,354 --> 00:22:23,441
Send half each way
down the river for...

278
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,574
...about five miles to
look for any signs.

279
00:22:25,674 --> 00:22:28,055
Then report back to the mission.
- Yes, sir.

280
00:22:28,155 --> 00:22:30,155
Forward.

281
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,160
Sorry, sir.

282
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,240
She sorta come loose.

283
00:23:06,161 --> 00:23:08,161
l'd like...

284
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:11,682
...l'd like to speak
to David Crockett.

285
00:23:11,782 --> 00:23:12,782
You did.

286
00:23:12,882 --> 00:23:15,382
That was David Crockett
from Tennessee?

287
00:23:15,482 --> 00:23:17,211
Yes, sir. And l oughta know.

288
00:23:17,311 --> 00:23:19,423
Me and him's
neighbours back home.

289
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,563
Only live 40 mile apart.

290
00:23:22,363 --> 00:23:24,364
Colonel Davy.

291
00:23:30,564 --> 00:23:33,465
Are you David Crockett, sir?
- That's my name.

292
00:23:33,565 --> 00:23:36,025
l'm Colonel Travis,
commanding the garrison.

293
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,546
l figured.

294
00:23:37,646 --> 00:23:41,131
Well, son, you'd better
start growing up.

295
00:23:44,087 --> 00:23:47,467
l'd like to speak to you
on a matter of gravest importance.

296
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:50,765
Sure. Let's find a corner.

297
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,088
Talking's dry work.

298
00:24:01,889 --> 00:24:03,890
You're learnin' fast.

299
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,590
Colonel.

300
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,691
l'm resignin' from you.

301
00:24:10,771 --> 00:24:14,471
l'm gonna marry up with Conchita
and be the man of this house.

302
00:24:14,571 --> 00:24:16,612
Bésame a kiss, señorita.

303
00:24:16,652 --> 00:24:19,472
l toss around a mess
of that proud Spanish, too.

304
00:24:19,572 --> 00:24:21,572
Most important part.

305
00:24:21,652 --> 00:24:24,118
Let's jig a little, mamacita.

306
00:24:26,484 --> 00:24:28,904
Light there and rest easy, Travis,

307
00:24:29,004 --> 00:24:31,300
while l bed down this buck.

308
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:35,035
He just ain't got no
head for whiskey.

309
00:24:36,966 --> 00:24:38,966
Parson.
- Yeah, Davy.

310
00:24:39,046 --> 00:24:41,514
Take him away.
- Yes, sir.

311
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:49,804
Let's wet our whistles.

312
00:24:49,928 --> 00:24:51,928
Words are dusty.

313
00:24:52,008 --> 00:24:54,008
l don't drink.

314
00:24:54,808 --> 00:24:56,809
Not ever?
- No.

315
00:24:58,249 --> 00:25:00,558
l've heard of such.

316
00:25:00,689 --> 00:25:02,830
Well, spread your
wampum, Travis.

317
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,930
My title is colonel.

318
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,010
Me, l'm a colonel, too.

319
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,751
Wouldn't it sound kinda silly,
chattering colonel, colonel,

320
00:25:10,851 --> 00:25:13,071
like a couple of
marsh shield birds?

321
00:25:13,171 --> 00:25:15,632
Just speak right up
and call me Crockett.

322
00:25:15,732 --> 00:25:17,712
Don't bother to use my title.

323
00:25:17,812 --> 00:25:20,519
Old drunken General
Flatford gave it...

324
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,833
...to me in the Choctaw lndian War.

325
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:25,003
l'll call you Travis.

326
00:25:29,414 --> 00:25:31,414
Very well, Crockett.

327
00:25:32,374 --> 00:25:36,195
l'd like your permission
to make a speech to your men.

328
00:25:36,295 --> 00:25:40,155
Well, they've heard many a speech
while l was congressifying.

329
00:25:40,255 --> 00:25:42,236
What would you talk about?

330
00:25:42,336 --> 00:25:45,328
Oh, about freedom... liberty.

331
00:25:45,976 --> 00:25:49,077
Well, they don't need
any such speech.

332
00:25:49,177 --> 00:25:51,157
These men are from Tennessee.

333
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:53,969
l'd like to explain why l want them...

334
00:25:54,069 --> 00:25:56,998
...to volunteer to fight
against Santa Anna.

335
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:59,098
Oh?

336
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:04,059
Not so careless.

337
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:09,670
You can't get new clothes
this side of Nacogdoches.

338
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,660
Tag.

339
00:26:15,861 --> 00:26:19,041
Tennesseans ain't exactly
against fighting,

340
00:26:19,141 --> 00:26:21,340
but they ain't much for listening...

341
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,762
...to speeches. What
would you tell them?

342
00:26:23,862 --> 00:26:25,992
Of the many and
unendurable hardships...

343
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:28,003
...the people have
been subjected to...

344
00:26:28,103 --> 00:26:30,183
...under the tyrannical government...

345
00:26:30,283 --> 00:26:32,363
...of this military
dictator Santa Anna.

346
00:26:32,464 --> 00:26:36,044
We have no rights in the courts,
no market for our produce.

347
00:26:36,144 --> 00:26:39,375
He has forbidden
trade with the North.

348
00:26:39,505 --> 00:26:41,505
Davy.

349
00:26:41,905 --> 00:26:43,885
l want a chance
for my money back.

350
00:26:43,985 --> 00:26:45,911
Why don't you leave Davy alone?

351
00:26:46,011 --> 00:26:48,446
He done beat you 38
times hand-runnin'.

352
00:26:48,546 --> 00:26:49,726
36.

353
00:26:49,826 --> 00:26:51,826
38.

354
00:26:52,227 --> 00:26:53,807
36.

355
00:26:53,907 --> 00:26:56,327
This'll only take a minute, Travis.

356
00:26:56,427 --> 00:26:58,428
Give me them feathers.

357
00:26:59,948 --> 00:27:01,948
Gentlemen.

358
00:27:04,788 --> 00:27:06,789
Balance your feathers.

359
00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:10,989
Get set. Go.

360
00:27:31,513 --> 00:27:35,593
Gotcha that time, Davy.
- lt was fair and square.

361
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:38,421
lf we can continue, l
would like to say...

362
00:27:38,521 --> 00:27:39,574
One minute, Travis.

363
00:27:39,674 --> 00:27:42,094
That was just for who
gets first chance.

364
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:45,425
Prepare yourself, Davy.
- l'm prepared.

365
00:27:47,235 --> 00:27:49,235
He's still on his feet.

366
00:27:49,315 --> 00:27:50,536
Oh, no.

367
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:53,230
Oh, yes.
- Oh, yes.

368
00:27:53,356 --> 00:27:55,356
And it's my turn.

369
00:28:00,797 --> 00:28:02,797
39.

370
00:28:04,838 --> 00:28:08,748
He'll never learn.
Let's get a bucket of water.

371
00:28:09,638 --> 00:28:12,459
Kind of a game the boys play
back in Tennessee.

372
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,260
Even though time is running out,
l must postpone this interview...

373
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,100
...until we can be assured
of no interruptions.

374
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,380
Step down off your
high horse, mister.

375
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,136
You don't get lard
less'n you boil the hog.

376
00:28:29,282 --> 00:28:31,512
Have one of these cigars.

377
00:28:31,642 --> 00:28:35,212
l brought 'em all the way
from New Orleans.

378
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:38,983
Were you going to tell
my Tennesseans...

379
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:41,123
...that a good many men,

380
00:28:41,163 --> 00:28:43,164
sound men all,

381
00:28:43,244 --> 00:28:47,104
had a plot to ease the suffering
of the people in these parts?

382
00:28:47,204 --> 00:28:48,936
Or were you going to tell them...

383
00:28:49,036 --> 00:28:51,145
...that Steve Austin,
Houston and others...

384
00:28:51,245 --> 00:28:56,431
...and you too, Travis, had planned
to declare for a republic?

385
00:28:56,566 --> 00:28:59,796
To declare this the
Republic of Texas?

386
00:28:59,886 --> 00:29:03,032
Were you gonna tell
'em that, Travis?

387
00:29:04,527 --> 00:29:07,187
l hadn't thought this was generally
known.

388
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,288
lt isn't yet.

389
00:29:09,368 --> 00:29:13,618
Not till Austin separates
the sheep from the goats.

390
00:29:13,768 --> 00:29:17,509
Not till he decides
who's on the right side.

391
00:29:17,929 --> 00:29:19,929
Republic.

392
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:21,990
l like the sound of the word.

393
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,150
lt means people can live free,

394
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,250
talk free,

395
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,371
go or come, buy or sell,

396
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:30,951
be drunk or sober.
However they choose.

397
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:34,249
Some words give you a feeling.

398
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,752
Republic is one of
those words that...

399
00:29:36,852 --> 00:29:39,572
...makes me tight in the throat.

400
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:42,793
Same tightness a
man gets when his...

401
00:29:42,893 --> 00:29:45,783
...baby takes his first step or...

402
00:29:46,173 --> 00:29:48,194
...his first baby shaves...

403
00:29:48,294 --> 00:29:51,694
...and makes his first
sound like a man.

404
00:29:52,694 --> 00:29:57,795
Some words can give you a feeling
that makes your heart warm.

405
00:29:58,015 --> 00:30:00,651
Republic is one of those words.

406
00:30:07,497 --> 00:30:09,497
Crockett.

407
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:15,558
l have, l believe,
learned two things about you.

408
00:30:15,658 --> 00:30:17,658
Worthwhile, l hope.

409
00:30:17,738 --> 00:30:20,436
You're not the illiterate
country bumpkin...

410
00:30:20,536 --> 00:30:22,359
...you would have people believe.

411
00:30:22,459 --> 00:30:26,040
You speak an excellent and
concise English when you wish.

412
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,280
The... bad grammar is a pose.

413
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,579
A fella has to do a
lot to get elected to

414
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,721
Congress. l've kissed
many a baby, too.

415
00:30:34,821 --> 00:30:38,882
The other is that you came
to Texas to fight with us.

416
00:30:38,982 --> 00:30:41,617
Don't tell my Tennesseans that.

417
00:30:41,942 --> 00:30:46,892
They think we came south
to hunt and... get drunk.

418
00:30:51,263 --> 00:30:54,654
They... seem to have
accomplished that.

419
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:49,748
Good evening, my
almost-vanishing lady.

420
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:57,454
lncredible. l arranged
for this carriage...

421
00:32:57,554 --> 00:33:00,214
...l would be heartbroken
if you left Bexar just now.

422
00:33:00,314 --> 00:33:03,015
Even more so if you left
with my team of horses,

423
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:06,135
which would bring
a pretty penny in these times...

424
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:10,401
...with two factions
buying anything on four legs.

425
00:33:26,518 --> 00:33:28,499
Do you have business here?

426
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:30,179
l promised Mother.

427
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:31,899
Your mother?

428
00:33:31,999 --> 00:33:35,260
Pray to the North Star.
Ten minutes every night.

429
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,080
A long line of star-worshippers.

430
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,741
lt keeps the rheumatiz away.

431
00:33:43,081 --> 00:33:45,661
lt seems to me you're
looking for trouble.

432
00:33:45,761 --> 00:33:47,762
lt do?

433
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,404
Let's go upstairs.
Unless you prefer...

434
00:33:53,505 --> 00:33:54,903
...discussing your business...

435
00:33:55,003 --> 00:33:58,828
...in front of every
drunken loafer in Bexar.

436
00:34:11,245 --> 00:34:13,706
l suppose that
overdressed ignoramus...

437
00:34:13,806 --> 00:34:16,585
...is one of the riffraff
here to resist Santa Anna.

438
00:34:16,686 --> 00:34:18,693
They'll find graves
and nothing else.

439
00:34:18,793 --> 00:34:20,467
Santa Anna will sweep across...

440
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:21,567
Overdressed?

441
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:23,746
l paid good money
for these clothes.

442
00:34:23,847 --> 00:34:25,847
Why?

443
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:38,208
Lady's luggage.

444
00:34:49,731 --> 00:34:52,536
Gratuity for the boy. You forgot.

445
00:35:04,573 --> 00:35:07,634
Son, l guess he isn't gonna tip you.

446
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:22,596
Another thing l promised Mother.

447
00:35:22,696 --> 00:35:26,717
Never to get in situations
where people pointed guns at me.

448
00:35:26,817 --> 00:35:29,277
Ma'am, it is possible
that l am mistaken,

449
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:33,318
but it seems to me you find this
gentleman's company distasteful.

450
00:35:33,418 --> 00:35:34,918
Tell him to get out.

451
00:35:35,018 --> 00:35:38,879
Thank you, sir, but there is no way
in which you could be of help.

452
00:35:38,979 --> 00:35:43,399
And l am in no danger.
- l bid you good night, ma'am.

453
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,020
Gratuity for the boy.

454
00:35:55,021 --> 00:35:57,022
Your property, sir.

455
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:27,501
We are guaranteed the protection
of the generalissimo himself.

456
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:30,022
But please don't
misunderstand me.

457
00:36:30,122 --> 00:36:32,102
l don't want all of your lands.

458
00:36:32,202 --> 00:36:36,113
Half will be sufficient for me.
l'm no glutton.

459
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:49,425
Easy, Graciela, easy. l speak your...

460
00:36:49,525 --> 00:36:51,825
...language, but that's
too fast for me.

461
00:36:51,925 --> 00:36:55,186
Though l dare say
l'm better off not understanding.

462
00:36:55,286 --> 00:36:57,666
You actually wanted
me to agree to this?

463
00:36:57,766 --> 00:36:59,766
This atrocity?.

464
00:36:59,846 --> 00:37:02,652
l actually did and l actually do.

465
00:37:03,327 --> 00:37:05,407
You're an educated
woman, Graciela.

466
00:37:05,507 --> 00:37:06,507
lntelligent.

467
00:37:06,607 --> 00:37:10,188
ls there any other way
to restore your family properties?

468
00:37:10,288 --> 00:37:13,688
Santa Anna's administrators
rule Potos?

469
00:37:14,489 --> 00:37:16,869
You... you expect me to marry you,

470
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:19,498
with my father and
four brothers newly...

471
00:37:19,598 --> 00:37:21,750
...buried in Potos?..
and my husband?

472
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:24,670
l expect it because it
is the logical course.

473
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:27,204
To marry you? Logical?.

474
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,831
Of course.

475
00:37:28,931 --> 00:37:30,911
l am acceptable to Santa Anna.

476
00:37:31,011 --> 00:37:34,125
lf he should be defeated,
l will manage...

477
00:37:34,225 --> 00:37:37,112
...to become acceptable
to his successors.

478
00:37:37,212 --> 00:37:41,973
That's the trick. To be acceptable
to the powers that be.

479
00:37:42,173 --> 00:37:45,193
Let's not pretend
you're a broken-hearted widow.

480
00:37:45,293 --> 00:37:47,334
You barely knew the man.

481
00:37:47,374 --> 00:37:49,433
The marriage was as
much arranged...

482
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:50,714
...as this one would be.

483
00:37:50,814 --> 00:37:54,395
Your family picked him up.
- That's the way of my people.

484
00:37:54,495 --> 00:37:56,115
You'll say yes.

485
00:37:56,215 --> 00:37:58,680
lt's your only possible path.

486
00:37:59,255 --> 00:38:02,556
Like all women,
you'll postpone the decision.

487
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:05,011
But you will say yes.

488
00:38:47,582 --> 00:38:49,401
Forgive me, ma'am, but l was...

489
00:38:49,501 --> 00:38:51,682
...having a smoke out
on that gallery...

490
00:38:51,783 --> 00:38:54,113
...and l couldn't
help but overhear...

491
00:38:54,213 --> 00:38:55,603
...l wasn't eavesdropping.

492
00:38:55,703 --> 00:38:58,281
But it rankles me when
somebody tries...

493
00:38:58,381 --> 00:39:00,564
...to force somebody
to do something.

494
00:39:00,664 --> 00:39:03,120
You haven't seen
me before tonight,

495
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,605
but l am offering you my services.

496
00:39:05,705 --> 00:39:08,445
lf that fella's making
you stay in Bexar,

497
00:39:08,545 --> 00:39:11,205
l'm ready, willing and able
to provide you...

498
00:39:11,306 --> 00:39:13,726
...a transport to
wherever you wanna go.

499
00:39:13,826 --> 00:39:17,246
And on the other hand,
if you choose to stay in Bexar,

500
00:39:17,346 --> 00:39:22,362
l'm ready, willing and able
to see that he don't bother you.

501
00:39:23,707 --> 00:39:26,095
Would you answer
one question with...

502
00:39:26,195 --> 00:39:28,648
...complete honesty,
Mr... Tall American?

503
00:39:28,748 --> 00:39:32,089
Ma'am, only modesty
restrains me from telling you...

504
00:39:32,189 --> 00:39:36,014
...that l am widely known
for my truthfulness.

505
00:39:36,669 --> 00:39:39,474
Would you so quickly
offer to defend me...

506
00:39:39,574 --> 00:39:41,970
...if l were 60 years
old and wrinkled?

507
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:45,371
Or is it because
l am young and a widow...

508
00:39:45,471 --> 00:39:49,551
...and you are far from home
and your loved ones?

509
00:39:53,072 --> 00:39:55,461
But thank you, anyway, sir.

510
00:39:57,473 --> 00:39:59,473
ln any event,

511
00:39:59,553 --> 00:40:03,634
this is a matter in which
no outsider could help.

512
00:40:04,314 --> 00:40:06,314
Mr Tall American.

513
00:40:07,034 --> 00:40:09,523
l do believe that
a woman in trouble,

514
00:40:09,624 --> 00:40:11,495
even though 60 and wrinkled,

515
00:40:11,595 --> 00:40:13,890
could turn to you for help.

516
00:40:16,276 --> 00:40:18,276
Good night, ma'am.

517
00:41:33,847 --> 00:41:35,268
Well, thanks, friend.

518
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:39,068
lf you don't insist on having them
to yourself, l'll give you a hand.

519
00:41:39,168 --> 00:41:41,169
Pleasure, friend.

520
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:44,067
You must be Jim Bowie.

521
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:46,629
The size and the shape
is as described...

522
00:41:46,729 --> 00:41:49,630
...and this knife is certainly
everything l heard it was.

523
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:52,280
l'm Bowie.
- l'm Davy Crockett.

524
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,616
Well. l've heard a lot about you.

525
00:41:55,651 --> 00:41:58,031
l've heard a lot about you, too.

526
00:41:58,131 --> 00:42:00,392
l'd admire to buy you a drink,
or eight or ten.

527
00:42:00,492 --> 00:42:02,492
Oh... Excuse me.

528
00:42:04,092 --> 00:42:06,593
Did you have some trouble
with Emil Sand?

529
00:42:06,693 --> 00:42:08,673
Who's Emil Sand?
- Merchant.

530
00:42:08,773 --> 00:42:11,513
Tall fella? Butter-coloured hair?
- That's him.

531
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:14,674
l've had some words with him.
lntend to have some more.

532
00:42:14,774 --> 00:42:15,960
How about that drink?

533
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,836
Honoured, Congressman Crockett.

534
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:23,467
Please, Jim. Don't call me that.
l've been trying to live it down.

535
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:41,453
Here's your extra
coat, Davy. And a jug.

536
00:42:41,553 --> 00:42:44,657
Thoughtful. You'd better
get some sleep, Smitty.

537
00:42:44,757 --> 00:42:46,759
l'm not tired.

538
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:48,821
lt's Mexico. Exciting night.

539
00:42:48,922 --> 00:42:51,825
Yeah, well, you'd still
better get some sleep.

540
00:42:51,925 --> 00:42:53,927
All right, Davy.

541
00:42:54,007 --> 00:42:54,828
Night, Smitty.

542
00:42:54,928 --> 00:42:57,736
Good night, Colonel Bowie... Jim.

543
00:43:02,857 --> 00:43:05,880
Took a long time for
this night to get unexciting.

544
00:43:05,981 --> 00:43:07,983
lt sure did.

545
00:43:08,704 --> 00:43:11,427
'Tis a mighty pretty one though.

546
00:43:11,947 --> 00:43:13,901
l understand you
moved down here...

547
00:43:14,001 --> 00:43:15,611
...lock, stock, and barrel, Jim.

548
00:43:15,711 --> 00:43:20,016
l didn't plan on moving.
Came for a visit and stayed.

549
00:43:20,116 --> 00:43:21,435
l gather you like it.

550
00:43:21,535 --> 00:43:23,700
Oh, Davy. lf you only knew Mexico.

551
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,998
lt's wonderful.

552
00:43:26,123 --> 00:43:29,667
l thought she was a burnt-over
desert most of the time.

553
00:43:29,767 --> 00:43:33,271
Nah... Most northerners
think that. lt ain't so.

554
00:43:33,371 --> 00:43:36,572
Big valleys between
high mountains.

555
00:43:36,695 --> 00:43:40,759
Just everything a man could want
in the way of country.

556
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:44,777
For looking at or...
or for growing on.

557
00:43:44,904 --> 00:43:47,295
But mostly...

558
00:43:47,427 --> 00:43:49,894
Mostly it's the people, Davy.

559
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:52,512
They got...

560
00:43:52,552 --> 00:43:55,175
This is kinda hard to explain, but...

561
00:43:55,275 --> 00:43:58,499
...they got courage
and they got dignity.

562
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:01,355
They ain't afraid to die.

563
00:44:01,482 --> 00:44:06,107
What seems most important to me
is that they ain't afraid to live.

564
00:44:06,207 --> 00:44:08,455
Today is important to them,

565
00:44:08,555 --> 00:44:11,618
not the dollar
tomorrow might bring.

566
00:44:11,814 --> 00:44:14,837
l suppose the Yankee
says that's lazy.

567
00:44:14,937 --> 00:44:18,411
Me? l say it's a way of livin'.

568
00:44:20,023 --> 00:44:22,025
And the womenfolk.

569
00:44:22,105 --> 00:44:23,327
Well, Davy...

570
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:26,090
...l figured you favoured
the Mexican ladies.

571
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:28,657
They tell me you married one.

572
00:44:29,473 --> 00:44:31,476
Yeah, l...

573
00:44:31,556 --> 00:44:33,558
...l did.

574
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:36,161
l...

575
00:44:37,002 --> 00:44:39,004
Well, Davy, l...

576
00:44:39,084 --> 00:44:42,483
...l just ain't got,
you know, your way...

577
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:46,072
...of putting things
into... into words, but...

578
00:44:46,172 --> 00:44:48,174
...l got a fine family.

579
00:44:49,576 --> 00:44:51,694
A wonderful wife and...

580
00:44:51,818 --> 00:44:54,051
...two fine boys.

581
00:44:55,823 --> 00:44:59,226
l guess l'm what you'd
call a lucky man.

582
00:44:59,226 --> 00:45:03,251
Now, that ain't a bad stab
at putting it into words.

583
00:45:03,351 --> 00:45:06,326
l... sent them up to Coahuila with...

584
00:45:06,426 --> 00:45:10,086
...all the trouble
around here, you know...

585
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,463
May l speak privately with you, sir?
- Sure, but...

586
00:45:14,563 --> 00:45:17,427
Aren't you Señora de López?
- Señor Bowie, l'm sorry.

587
00:45:17,527 --> 00:45:20,870
l did not recognise you.
- This place ain't fit for...

588
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:22,953
...l know. But the matter is urgent.

589
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:26,317
Could l have a few private words
with this gentleman?

590
00:45:26,417 --> 00:45:27,678
Sure. Excuse me.

591
00:45:27,778 --> 00:45:30,011
l'll be inside, Crockett.

592
00:45:30,141 --> 00:45:32,338
Crockett?

593
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,606
You are the famous
David Crockett?

594
00:45:34,706 --> 00:45:36,708
Well, l'm Crockett.

595
00:45:36,788 --> 00:45:38,873
They named me Davy
after an uncle...

596
00:45:38,973 --> 00:45:41,293
...that didn't leave
Pa the farm after all.

597
00:45:41,393 --> 00:45:44,023
Mr Crockett, shortly
after you left my...

598
00:45:44,123 --> 00:45:46,819
...room l heard an
altercation in the street.

599
00:45:46,919 --> 00:45:48,281
l could hear the sound,

600
00:45:48,381 --> 00:45:50,664
though l could not
see from my window.

601
00:45:50,764 --> 00:45:52,746
lt sounded like a drunken brawl.

602
00:45:52,846 --> 00:45:55,749
Well, sittin' right here
l didn't hear a thing.

603
00:45:55,849 --> 00:45:59,353
Well, anyway, l saw lights
in the old church...

604
00:45:59,453 --> 00:46:02,637
...and people moving about.
And one of them was Emil.

605
00:46:02,737 --> 00:46:04,439
And... a thought came to me.

606
00:46:04,539 --> 00:46:07,442
As you may know,
Colonel Travis has ordered...

607
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:10,646
...all powder and ball
from the merchants of Bexar.

608
00:46:10,746 --> 00:46:13,809
And he didn't find any
at Emil's warehouse.

609
00:46:13,909 --> 00:46:19,441
lt's my opinion... it's all hidden
in the basement of that church.

610
00:46:19,876 --> 00:46:21,878
And... Mr Crockett...

611
00:46:21,958 --> 00:46:24,283
The defenders of
Texas are going to...

612
00:46:24,383 --> 00:46:26,584
...need that powder
against Santa Anna.

613
00:46:26,684 --> 00:46:30,107
And you're against Santa Anna?
- Bitterly. Of course.

614
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:32,510
And this... Emil? He's for him?

615
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:34,612
Yes, he is.

616
00:46:34,733 --> 00:46:37,115
Then, how did he figure
you'd marry him?

617
00:46:37,215 --> 00:46:40,119
Political arguments
don't flavour folks' supper.

618
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:42,336
Nevertheless, l am
going to marry him.

619
00:46:42,436 --> 00:46:44,724
Please let's not
discuss it, Mr Crockett.

620
00:46:44,824 --> 00:46:47,647
The name is Davy,
and l couldn't sleep nights...

621
00:46:47,747 --> 00:46:50,130
Will you say goodbye
for me to Mr Bowie?

622
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:52,532
Well, l...
- l can make my own way...

623
00:46:52,633 --> 00:46:56,121
...and l hope the
information is helpful.

624
00:47:10,933 --> 00:47:12,915
Something interesting, Jim.

625
00:47:13,015 --> 00:47:15,352
Parson, round up a
couple of the men,

626
00:47:15,452 --> 00:47:18,241
fairly sober, and meet
us out in the street.

627
00:47:18,341 --> 00:47:20,699
Where are we goin'?

628
00:47:20,824 --> 00:47:22,866
The church.
- Yeah, Davy.

629
00:47:31,276 --> 00:47:33,278
Hey.

630
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:35,360
Parson.

631
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:38,060
Why'd you run off without me?

632
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,506
l told him to stay
behind. He's drunk.

633
00:47:40,606 --> 00:47:43,589
Stick to the point.
Why'd you run off without me?

634
00:47:43,689 --> 00:47:45,832
Jim, this is Beekeeper. Jim Bowie.

635
00:47:45,932 --> 00:47:47,974
Hi.
- You can come along.

636
00:47:48,014 --> 00:47:50,916
But hold your breath.
Can they smell,

637
00:47:51,016 --> 00:47:53,520
they'll be warned you're coming.

638
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,623
Excuse me.

639
00:48:14,323 --> 00:48:16,326
Grab that torch.
- Yeah.

640
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,738
Excuse me.

641
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:55,769
Well. Here, Parson.

642
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,852
Yes, sir.

643
00:49:04,179 --> 00:49:06,476
Rifles.
- Must be 50 of 'em.

644
00:49:11,307 --> 00:49:12,528
That's gunpowder.

645
00:49:12,628 --> 00:49:15,291
Let me take a look at that stuff.
- Watch it.

646
00:49:15,391 --> 00:49:18,710
Stand back and stand still.
- Excuse me.

647
00:49:20,277 --> 00:49:22,259
There must be a ton of it.

648
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:26,223
l'm sure gonna be looking forward
to seeing that soldier boy's face...

649
00:49:26,323 --> 00:49:28,451
...when we bring this in.

650
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:14,182
lt's a beautiful
morning, Davy Crockett.

651
00:51:14,282 --> 00:51:16,594
lt is that,

652
00:51:16,725 --> 00:51:18,727
María de López y Vejar.

653
00:51:18,808 --> 00:51:21,030
My goodness. You
remember all that?

654
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:25,385
Sure. l'm not as stupid
as l look from the outside.

655
00:51:25,495 --> 00:51:28,376
What's Spanish for breakfast?

656
00:51:28,498 --> 00:51:31,642
Let's take a paseado out
and get some desayuno.

657
00:51:31,742 --> 00:51:33,724
Paseado?
- That means ''walk''.

658
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:37,208
That means ''have walked''.
But never mind. l'll get dressed.

659
00:51:37,308 --> 00:51:39,310
Wait a minute.

660
00:51:40,111 --> 00:51:42,093
First, write me a letter.

661
00:51:42,194 --> 00:51:44,196
A letter?

662
00:51:44,276 --> 00:51:46,278
ln Spanish.
- Of course.

663
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,062
To whom is the letter addressed?

664
00:51:50,162 --> 00:51:53,186
To the Honorable Davy
Crockett Esquire.

665
00:51:53,286 --> 00:51:55,048
You wish a letter
written to yourself?

666
00:51:55,148 --> 00:51:56,149
Yep.

667
00:51:56,249 --> 00:51:59,313
To the Honorable
Davy Crockett Esquire,

668
00:51:59,413 --> 00:52:03,477
former Congressman of
the United States of America.

669
00:52:03,577 --> 00:52:05,580
Esteemed sir...

670
00:52:10,328 --> 00:52:12,330
Hurry it up there.

671
00:52:20,739 --> 00:52:21,740
Seen Davy?

672
00:52:21,841 --> 00:52:25,159
Ain't nobody seen
Davy. He ain't about.

673
00:52:25,385 --> 00:52:28,788
First lie you've told
today, Thimblerig.

674
00:52:29,469 --> 00:52:31,471
Mornin', Davy.
- Howdy.

675
00:52:31,551 --> 00:52:34,094
Say, Davy, what kind
of a load you got there?

676
00:52:34,194 --> 00:52:36,407
Presents for some friends.

677
00:52:36,477 --> 00:52:38,479
Let's go, Parson.

678
00:53:00,704 --> 00:53:02,776
Halt. Who goes there?

679
00:53:02,906 --> 00:53:04,688
ls that you, Bob?

680
00:53:04,788 --> 00:53:07,180
Why, sure. Can't you see?

681
00:53:07,311 --> 00:53:11,656
Then what kind of idiot nonsense
is this ''Who goes there''?

682
00:53:11,756 --> 00:53:14,007
Well, Travis - Colonel
Travis, that is -...

683
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,340
...he says that l should...

684
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,753
...l don't care what
Travis said. Open...

685
00:53:18,853 --> 00:53:22,682
...the gate before l
shoot you off that wall.

686
00:53:24,322 --> 00:53:27,726
Sentry. Open the gate
for Colonel Bowie.

687
00:53:38,818 --> 00:53:40,901
Near a ton of good
powder here, men.

688
00:53:41,001 --> 00:53:42,002
Get it unloaded.

689
00:53:42,102 --> 00:53:45,085
That long one there,
he's Davy Crockett.

690
00:53:45,185 --> 00:53:48,129
And three of his good men.
- Colonel Crockett.

691
00:53:48,229 --> 00:53:50,231
Hello, Travis.

692
00:53:50,391 --> 00:53:52,453
Looks like the answer to a prayer.

693
00:53:52,553 --> 00:53:55,108
Colonel, l'd be pleased
if you'd join me...

694
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:57,339
...in my quarters
for some refreshment.

695
00:53:57,439 --> 00:53:59,441
Proud to.

696
00:53:59,962 --> 00:54:03,621
Oh, and you too,
Colonel Bowie, if you will.

697
00:54:13,977 --> 00:54:16,400
l'm a stranger around
these here parts.

698
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,323
What do you Texicans use
for drinkin' whiskey?

699
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:23,508
Drinkin' whiskey.
- You got manners or ain't you?

700
00:54:26,334 --> 00:54:29,518
Captain Dickinson,
this is Colonel Davy Crockett.

701
00:54:29,618 --> 00:54:31,620
Morning, Dick.

702
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:34,243
Oh, and this is my
cousin Mrs Dickinson.

703
00:54:34,343 --> 00:54:36,645
Colonel Crockett.
- Colonel Bowie.

704
00:54:36,746 --> 00:54:39,569
Well, it's nice meeting you,
Davy Crockett.

705
00:54:39,669 --> 00:54:41,651
l feel as if l know you already.

706
00:54:41,751 --> 00:54:44,334
You see, part of my family
come from Tennessee...

707
00:54:44,434 --> 00:54:46,577
...and, well, your
name is a household...

708
00:54:46,677 --> 00:54:48,819
...word there. At least
in our house it was.

709
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:51,943
Thank you, ma'am.
lt's nice to be well thought of.

710
00:54:52,043 --> 00:54:54,605
Mommy.
- Oh, yes, darling.

711
00:54:55,406 --> 00:54:58,510
Oh. l've asked you
not to climb those stairs alone.

712
00:54:58,610 --> 00:54:59,701
Well, who's this?

713
00:54:59,801 --> 00:55:02,034
You say hello to Colonel Crockett?

714
00:55:02,134 --> 00:55:04,136
Hello.

715
00:55:04,216 --> 00:55:07,400
Every size they get to
seems to be the most lovable.

716
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,968
Will you gentlemen excuse me?

717
00:55:11,104 --> 00:55:12,766
Goodbye, Colonel.

718
00:55:12,866 --> 00:55:14,868
Goodbye.

719
00:55:14,948 --> 00:55:18,252
Kind of a shame
kids have to grow up into people.

720
00:55:18,352 --> 00:55:22,096
lt's good we're all here, gentlemen.
A cigar?

721
00:55:24,479 --> 00:55:26,901
Please, make yourselves
comfortable.

722
00:55:27,001 --> 00:55:29,985
l have some news.
Fannin is doing well at Goliad.

723
00:55:30,085 --> 00:55:32,588
He has mustered
almost a thousand men...

724
00:55:32,688 --> 00:55:34,578
...and should be
ready to move south...

725
00:55:34,678 --> 00:55:35,871
...by the first of the week.

726
00:55:35,971 --> 00:55:38,950
A thousand? lt
don't seem possible.

727
00:55:38,975 --> 00:55:41,518
lt does sound too good to be true,
l must confess.

728
00:55:41,618 --> 00:55:44,080
But we can only admit
our doubts to each other.

729
00:55:44,181 --> 00:55:47,204
ln the privacy of a room
and not in front of the men.

730
00:55:47,304 --> 00:55:49,648
As far as the volunteers
are concerned,

731
00:55:49,748 --> 00:55:51,969
we're sure Fannin
has a thousand men.

732
00:55:52,069 --> 00:55:55,053
l got a reputation for truth, Travis.
- l ain't.

733
00:55:55,153 --> 00:55:57,909
Everybody says l'm a born liar.

734
00:55:58,036 --> 00:56:00,555
But whether we talk
out loud or quiet...

735
00:56:00,655 --> 00:56:02,981
...don't seem to me
the point right now.

736
00:56:03,082 --> 00:56:05,363
The point is how many
men has Fannin...

737
00:56:05,463 --> 00:56:07,146
...and will he get here in time?

738
00:56:07,246 --> 00:56:08,762
Whether he does or doesn't,

739
00:56:08,862 --> 00:56:11,191
we'll be trapped here.
And for no reason.

740
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:14,354
We should burn all of Bexar,
including this mission.

741
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,438
And annoy Santa Anna
while he sweeps...

742
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,158
...north across the whole of Texas?

743
00:56:18,258 --> 00:56:21,042
That's Colonel Bowie's theory.
- We could hit and run.

744
00:56:21,142 --> 00:56:23,044
Jump him at every
creek crossing...

745
00:56:23,144 --> 00:56:24,906
You seem to forget
one thing, Colonel.

746
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:26,007
That l command.

747
00:56:26,107 --> 00:56:29,851
And l have already
decided against your plan.

748
00:56:31,794 --> 00:56:33,295
Now...

749
00:56:33,395 --> 00:56:35,978
Let us attack a more
important problem.

750
00:56:36,078 --> 00:56:38,060
Colonel Crockett's Tennesseans.

751
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:40,288
Will they fight, Colonel?

752
00:56:40,403 --> 00:56:42,673
Last time l saw 'em
they hadn't shown...

753
00:56:42,773 --> 00:56:44,868
...any strong feelings
against fighting.

754
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:47,707
Can you persuade
them to come here?

755
00:56:47,807 --> 00:56:48,953
l can ask them.

756
00:56:49,053 --> 00:56:52,997
And you're a very persuasive man
according to your reputation.

757
00:56:53,097 --> 00:56:55,115
Build up the story that Fannin has...

758
00:56:55,216 --> 00:56:57,122
...a thousand... no,
two thousand men.

759
00:56:57,222 --> 00:56:59,176
Play down the size
of Santa Anna's...

760
00:56:59,276 --> 00:57:00,525
We've been through this.

761
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:03,409
He wants me to lie to my men, too.
Keep 'em here with lies.

762
00:57:03,509 --> 00:57:05,511
Let the truth of Santa
Anna's strength...

763
00:57:05,611 --> 00:57:07,613
...be known and there
won't be a dozen left.

764
00:57:07,713 --> 00:57:09,269
You calling my boys cowards?

765
00:57:09,369 --> 00:57:11,498
Let us dispense with
the pyrotechnics.

766
00:57:11,598 --> 00:57:13,472
Remember this. My
men are volunteers.

767
00:57:13,572 --> 00:57:15,342
They're here because
they wanna be.

768
00:57:15,442 --> 00:57:20,122
But there's nothing to keep 'em
from gettin' outta here.

769
00:57:20,648 --> 00:57:23,711
l'm aware that your
men are militia.

770
00:57:24,212 --> 00:57:26,795
And, like all volunteers,
undisciplined.

771
00:57:26,895 --> 00:57:28,937
Good day, Colonel Bowie.

772
00:57:36,706 --> 00:57:39,992
Last night gave you
a pretty good idea...

773
00:57:40,092 --> 00:57:42,730
...of the discipline of my men.

774
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:45,631
Our position here is desperate.

775
00:57:47,157 --> 00:57:50,676
And l feel sure that
where Crockett leads...

776
00:57:50,776 --> 00:57:52,503
...his men will follow.

777
00:57:52,603 --> 00:57:54,606
Yeah.

778
00:57:54,686 --> 00:57:59,451
That's a responsibility that's...
been kinda worrying me.

779
00:58:03,816 --> 00:58:06,639
Thank you, gentlemen.
l'm gonna pass the word around.

780
00:58:06,739 --> 00:58:08,243
What you Texans use for...

781
00:58:08,343 --> 00:58:10,683
...drinkin' whiskey...
is drinkin' whiskey.

782
00:58:10,784 --> 00:58:14,648
And what's more important,
you got real good manners,

783
00:58:14,748 --> 00:58:17,609
seein' how you suffer the handicap...

784
00:58:17,709 --> 00:58:20,334
...of having never
been in Tennessee.

785
00:58:20,434 --> 00:58:24,219
Davy, is it true that you fit
a four-day fight with Mike Fink?

786
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:26,882
Why, that's a blasted lie.

787
00:58:27,002 --> 00:58:30,425
One of them stories
loose-mouthed people tell around.

788
00:58:30,526 --> 00:58:32,508
Mike and me quit at sundown.

789
00:58:32,608 --> 00:58:36,192
Wouldn't have been the fourth day
until... next morning.

790
00:58:36,292 --> 00:58:37,593
See you, men.

791
00:58:37,694 --> 00:58:39,696
Let her rip, Parson.

792
00:58:58,812 --> 00:59:00,354
Señora López.

793
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:02,676
Don Juan, this is
Mr Davy Crockett.

794
00:59:02,776 --> 00:59:04,759
l'm honoured.
- How do you do?

795
00:59:04,859 --> 00:59:06,890
Señor Seguin is the
alcalde... l mean,

796
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:08,803
the mayor of San
Antonio de Bexar.

797
00:59:08,903 --> 00:59:10,885
He's got a pretty busy town.

798
00:59:10,986 --> 00:59:14,449
People are running like sheep
that have smelled a wolf pack.

799
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:17,066
l never said no such a thing.

800
00:59:17,192 --> 00:59:19,281
When us took that powder in there,

801
00:59:19,381 --> 00:59:22,098
that fella Travis asked
if us Tennesseans...

802
00:59:22,198 --> 00:59:24,861
...was gonna join up
with him. That's all.

803
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:27,304
He never asked us
to fight his fight for him.

804
00:59:27,404 --> 00:59:30,307
Have some breakfast.
- Breakfast?. Tortillas?

805
00:59:30,407 --> 00:59:32,409
Tamale.

806
00:59:35,493 --> 00:59:37,795
Never get burnt drinking this stuff.

807
00:59:37,895 --> 00:59:39,982
Well, l only know part of Texas and...

808
00:59:40,082 --> 00:59:42,280
...none of these Texicans
is related to me,

809
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:44,363
so why should l fight for them?

810
00:59:44,463 --> 00:59:47,246
Right. Ain't our ox
that's gettin' gored.

811
00:59:47,346 --> 00:59:51,549
Talkin' about whose ox
gets gored... figure this.

812
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:54,890
A fella gets in the
habit of goring oxes,

813
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:56,456
whets his appetite.

814
00:59:56,556 --> 00:59:59,339
He may come up north next
and gore yours.

815
00:59:59,439 --> 01:00:02,640
Men, we're in a little fix, sort of.

816
01:00:03,924 --> 01:00:05,651
The he-bull around here -

817
01:00:05,751 --> 01:00:08,189
General Santa Anna.
He's mad at us.

818
01:00:08,289 --> 01:00:09,471
Yeah?

819
01:00:09,571 --> 01:00:11,573
He's wrote us a letter.

820
01:00:11,653 --> 01:00:13,635
l can't read it. lt's in Spanish.

821
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,778
But the young lady will.

822
01:00:25,949 --> 01:00:28,327
lt is addressed to
Davy Crockett and...

823
01:00:28,427 --> 01:00:30,494
...the Tennesseans
who accompany him.

824
01:00:30,594 --> 01:00:32,596
Be it known:

825
01:00:32,676 --> 01:00:34,992
You are interlopers
in a country where...

826
01:00:35,092 --> 01:00:37,061
...you are neither
wanted nor welcome.

827
01:00:37,161 --> 01:00:39,144
This is the order you are given.

828
01:00:39,244 --> 01:00:41,273
Depart with all haste and at once,

829
01:00:41,373 --> 01:00:43,709
because it has come
to our attention...

830
01:00:43,809 --> 01:00:46,352
...that you are possibly
considering joining...

831
01:00:46,452 --> 01:00:48,554
...the rebels now
skulking in the mission.

832
01:00:48,654 --> 01:00:51,855
This is not your fight. Depart.

833
01:00:51,978 --> 01:00:55,297
Should you fail to
abide by this order,

834
01:00:55,542 --> 01:00:58,696
l shall chastise
you even unto death.

835
01:00:58,825 --> 01:01:03,427
Signed: Generalissimo
Antonio Miguel de Santa Anna.

836
01:01:06,114 --> 01:01:09,057
Fella kinda fancies
himself, don't he?

837
01:01:09,157 --> 01:01:11,780
Sure does have a
big-sounding name.

838
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,780
Givin' us orders. Who
do he think he is?

839
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,305
Andy by God Jackson?

840
01:01:16,405 --> 01:01:20,510
Riles me when somebody tells me
to go here or l can't go there.

841
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,912
l ain't never been
run out of no place.

842
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:26,276
Except the time my old paw
kicked me over every acre...

843
01:01:26,376 --> 01:01:29,039
...of that half-section
back there in Ohio.

844
01:01:29,139 --> 01:01:32,483
But l was just a shirt-tail kid then.
My paw had big feet.

845
01:01:32,583 --> 01:01:35,526
What do you say, Davy?
Are we gonna let this man...

846
01:01:35,626 --> 01:01:37,609
...tell us what we can or can't do?

847
01:01:37,709 --> 01:01:42,814
Davy, maybe we'd better saddle up
and pay this fella a visit.

848
01:01:45,317 --> 01:01:47,440
Do chastise mean
what l think it do?

849
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:48,541
lt do.

850
01:01:48,641 --> 01:01:51,448
Davy, let's do saddle
up and go learn...

851
01:01:51,548 --> 01:01:53,426
...that gentleman his manners.

852
01:01:53,526 --> 01:01:58,191
We won't have to. He's wearin' out
horses comin' toward us.

853
01:01:58,292 --> 01:02:00,955
Well, l guess we can't
stop him from coming.

854
01:02:01,055 --> 01:02:04,318
But l reckon we can arrange
for him to limp going back.

855
01:02:04,418 --> 01:02:06,435
l was thinking these Texicans...

856
01:02:06,535 --> 01:02:09,003
...wasn't as neighbourly
as they might be.

857
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:11,041
But here they've
gone and arranged...

858
01:02:11,141 --> 01:02:12,648
...a nice fight for us visitors.

859
01:02:12,748 --> 01:02:16,532
One thing l oughta tell you.
Santa Anna never wrote that letter.

860
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:18,174
l did.

861
01:02:18,274 --> 01:02:20,937
Or rather... l had this
lady here write it.

862
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:25,382
l was figuring how to tell you fellas
about this Texican hoedown.

863
01:02:25,482 --> 01:02:27,591
l wondered what Santa
Anna would've...

864
01:02:27,691 --> 01:02:30,027
...said to us if he'd
had a chance to say it.

865
01:02:30,127 --> 01:02:32,910
Davy, l ain't never said
l ain't been whupped. l have.

866
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:34,765
But l give every one of them fellas...

867
01:02:34,865 --> 01:02:36,714
...a chance to dig in
and get the job done.

868
01:02:36,814 --> 01:02:39,001
But l ain't never
took nobody's word...

869
01:02:39,101 --> 01:02:40,599
...that they was gonna chas...

870
01:02:40,699 --> 01:02:43,081
Chastise.
- Chastise. Much obliged.

871
01:02:43,181 --> 01:02:46,365
We're gonna stay, ain't we?
- l'm thinking it over.

872
01:02:46,465 --> 01:02:49,288
What is there to think about?
You getting that old?

873
01:02:49,388 --> 01:02:51,451
The man toed the
mark and dared us.

874
01:02:51,551 --> 01:02:54,454
Chastise, he said.
- That's right. Chastise.

875
01:02:54,554 --> 01:02:57,738
But l wrote the letter.
- Don't you start weaslin'.

876
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:00,264
You said them'd be the
words he'd write...

877
01:03:00,365 --> 01:03:02,143
...if he was to write us a letter.

878
01:03:02,243 --> 01:03:04,665
Well, gentlemen,
you've convinced me.

879
01:03:04,765 --> 01:03:06,768
We'll fight.

880
01:03:06,848 --> 01:03:09,791
That's more like it.
- Now you're talkin', Davy.

881
01:03:09,891 --> 01:03:12,634
First, the young lady and l
will take a pasear.

882
01:03:12,734 --> 01:03:17,279
Gather up your possibles
and l'll meet up with you later.

883
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:19,592
Your Spanish is improving.

884
01:03:21,184 --> 01:03:24,367
lt kinda cheers me to see
the colonel with that lady.

885
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:27,786
Last couple of years
he had me worried.

886
01:03:27,911 --> 01:03:31,695
Lately he ain't been looking
at the girls like he was starved.

887
01:03:31,796 --> 01:03:35,540
Being in Congress
has ruined many a good man.

888
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:45,702
All l hear is Crockett
the bear-killer...

889
01:03:45,802 --> 01:03:47,985
Crockett the lndian-fighter...

890
01:03:48,085 --> 01:03:50,087
Crockett the brawler...

891
01:03:50,167 --> 01:03:52,399
Crockett has brains.

892
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:54,712
Kept it hidden a number of years.

893
01:03:54,812 --> 01:03:57,475
You like my Tennesseans, Flaca?
- Oh, yes.

894
01:03:57,575 --> 01:04:02,000
Could strain 10,000
and never come up with 23 better.

895
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:06,165
Every one of those men has been
at my elbow, save the boy Smitty,

896
01:04:06,265 --> 01:04:09,419
when some difficulty arose.

897
01:04:09,549 --> 01:04:11,749
Some of them don't bathe as often...

898
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:14,174
...as polite folks
would think necessary.

899
01:04:14,274 --> 01:04:17,678
But every one of them
smells sweet to me.

900
01:04:18,679 --> 01:04:23,544
And l was the one that said
this country was burnt-over sand.

901
01:04:23,644 --> 01:04:25,646
lt's green and growing.

902
01:04:26,527 --> 01:04:30,101
Like those green pastures
they talk about.

903
01:04:31,853 --> 01:04:35,737
Lord above. That's
one beautiful tree.

904
01:04:58,443 --> 01:05:00,705
This tree must've been growed...

905
01:05:00,806 --> 01:05:05,911
...before man put his first
dirty footprints on this prairie.

906
01:05:08,054 --> 01:05:12,053
Kind of a tree Adam and Eve
must have met under.

907
01:05:20,027 --> 01:05:22,239
You know something, Flaca?

908
01:05:22,269 --> 01:05:24,692
l guess l saw
who knows how many trees...

909
01:05:24,792 --> 01:05:27,976
...before l ever took
a long, thoughtful look at one.

910
01:05:28,076 --> 01:05:31,713
Mostly l looked at a
tree to see was there...

911
01:05:31,813 --> 01:05:34,783
...a bear in it or an lndian behind it.

912
01:05:34,883 --> 01:05:37,862
Davy, what's going
to happen to us?

913
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,159
l mean, to you and me.

914
01:05:41,291 --> 01:05:43,145
l'm gonna tell you
something, Flaca,

915
01:05:43,245 --> 01:05:44,834
and l want you to listen tight.

916
01:05:44,935 --> 01:05:47,155
lt may sound like
l'm talking about me,

917
01:05:47,255 --> 01:05:48,719
but l'm talkin' about you.

918
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:51,602
ln fact, l'm talking about
all people everywhere.

919
01:05:51,702 --> 01:05:55,326
When l came down here to Texas,
l was looking for something.

920
01:05:55,426 --> 01:05:57,465
l didn't know what.

921
01:05:57,589 --> 01:05:59,811
lt seems like you added up my life,

922
01:05:59,911 --> 01:06:03,059
and l'd spent it all
either stomping other...

923
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:05,738
...men or in some
cases getting stomped.

924
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:08,821
Had me some money
and had me some medals.

925
01:06:08,921 --> 01:06:10,900
But none of it seemed a lifetime...

926
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:13,386
...worth the pain of
the mother that bore me.

927
01:06:13,486 --> 01:06:15,489
lt's like l was empty.

928
01:06:15,569 --> 01:06:17,551
Well, l'm not empty any more.

929
01:06:17,651 --> 01:06:19,929
That's what's important.

930
01:06:20,054 --> 01:06:22,316
To feel useful in this old world.

931
01:06:22,416 --> 01:06:26,801
To hit a lick against what's wrong,
or to say a word for what's right...

932
01:06:26,901 --> 01:06:30,165
...even though you get walloped
for sayin' that word.

933
01:06:30,265 --> 01:06:32,220
l may sound like a Bible-beater...

934
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,570
...yellin' up a revival
at a camp meeting,

935
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:37,093
but that don't change
the truth none.

936
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:40,536
There's right and there's wrong.
You gotta do one or the other.

937
01:06:40,637 --> 01:06:42,619
You do the one and you're living.

938
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:46,112
You do the other and
you may be walking...

939
01:06:46,212 --> 01:06:49,871
...around, but you're
dead as a beaver hat.

940
01:06:51,368 --> 01:06:54,015
l'd hoped for a horse, but there's...

941
01:06:54,116 --> 01:06:56,835
...nothing wrong with
a good strong mule.

942
01:06:56,935 --> 01:06:59,292
My things.

943
01:06:59,417 --> 01:07:01,400
All my luggage is in the buggy.

944
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,482
Had my men take care of it.

945
01:07:03,582 --> 01:07:06,353
Your geegaws may
be rough-packed...

946
01:07:06,453 --> 01:07:08,581
...but they're all there.

947
01:07:12,792 --> 01:07:15,430
You are sending me away. You...

948
01:07:16,476 --> 01:07:20,646
You talked about the fight
against evil but you...

949
01:07:21,442 --> 01:07:23,910
You are sending me to safety.

950
01:07:24,525 --> 01:07:26,948
Flaca, you have an
important name.

951
01:07:27,048 --> 01:07:30,512
You know a million words
and how they should be used.

952
01:07:30,612 --> 01:07:34,677
l'm sending you to fight your war,
to talk up a howling mob.

953
01:07:34,777 --> 01:07:37,330
l'll stay here and hit a lick.

954
01:07:39,382 --> 01:07:41,765
l hope you can drive a mule.

955
01:07:41,785 --> 01:07:43,927
His name's Jesús, they told me.

956
01:07:44,027 --> 01:07:46,749
He seems a good, honest mule.

957
01:07:53,357 --> 01:07:55,820
Maybe l'll never see you again.

958
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,024
lf that's what's written,
that's what's written.

959
01:07:59,124 --> 01:08:01,106
When it's time, it's time.

960
01:08:01,206 --> 01:08:03,709
Talkin' only makes it
the harder, Flaca.

961
01:08:03,809 --> 01:08:05,811
So stir up that mule.

962
01:08:05,891 --> 01:08:07,894
Davy, l...

963
01:08:21,469 --> 01:08:23,935
You never pray, do you, Davy?

964
01:08:27,555 --> 01:08:29,558
l never found the time.

965
01:08:55,118 --> 01:08:57,120
Sir. Tennesseans.

966
01:09:01,805 --> 01:09:04,447
Colonel Travis.

967
01:09:04,569 --> 01:09:06,571
Crockett and his men.

968
01:09:10,095 --> 01:09:12,077
Go down and open the gate.

969
01:09:12,176 --> 01:09:14,179
l'll just holler down.

970
01:09:14,259 --> 01:09:17,843
Your orders were to go down,
not holler down, Mr Dennison.

971
01:09:17,943 --> 01:09:19,946
Yes, sir.

972
01:09:34,602 --> 01:09:36,663
Crack shots, those Tennesseans.

973
01:09:36,764 --> 01:09:40,549
Twenty times their number's
what we need, and more.

974
01:09:40,649 --> 01:09:44,673
Oh, l'm sorry, Will. Such gloomy
remarks are for your ears alone.

975
01:09:44,773 --> 01:09:48,346
lsn't that Bowie
galloping up to catch 'em?

976
01:09:52,301 --> 01:09:54,684
l can just hear him
pleading his cause.

977
01:09:54,784 --> 01:09:56,854
Crockett seems to me
the type of man...

978
01:09:56,954 --> 01:09:58,208
...that would choose Bowie.

979
01:09:58,308 --> 01:09:59,199
What you mean is...

980
01:09:59,299 --> 01:10:01,131
...he isn't the type
of man to choose me.

981
01:10:01,232 --> 01:10:04,215
Oh, Will. Depend on you
to say it the most brutal way.

982
01:10:04,315 --> 01:10:06,707
Most facts are brutal.

983
01:10:11,203 --> 01:10:14,626
Just look at that great knife fighter
yapping at Crockett.

984
01:10:14,727 --> 01:10:16,729
Cut, slash, and run.

985
01:10:16,809 --> 01:10:19,592
Let's get mounted.
Cut, slash, and run.

986
01:10:19,692 --> 01:10:21,694
Cut, slash, and run.

987
01:10:21,774 --> 01:10:25,479
Cost Santa Anna a hundred troops
at every creek crossing...

988
01:10:25,579 --> 01:10:27,561
...between here and the North.

989
01:10:27,661 --> 01:10:30,164
Sounds reasonable
the way you put it,

990
01:10:30,264 --> 01:10:33,247
but Travis has a point, too.
Takes thinkin' on.

991
01:10:33,347 --> 01:10:34,368
Hey, Jim.

992
01:10:34,469 --> 01:10:36,587
Halt. Who goes there?

993
01:10:36,711 --> 01:10:40,896
Bob, l swear l'm gonna shoot you
off that wall. Are you blind?

994
01:10:40,996 --> 01:10:42,397
That's what l was told
to holler every...

995
01:10:42,497 --> 01:10:43,499
...time.

996
01:10:43,599 --> 01:10:45,581
Well, don't holler at me.

997
01:10:45,681 --> 01:10:47,263
ldiot.

998
01:10:47,363 --> 01:10:51,022
You think on it, Davy.
You'll side with me.

999
01:10:59,576 --> 01:11:01,579
What is it?

1000
01:11:01,659 --> 01:11:05,603
Tennesseans, Nell. 23 of 'em.
All the way from home.

1001
01:11:05,703 --> 01:11:09,007
Do you recognise any, Jocko?
ls my brother Malachi with them?

1002
01:11:09,107 --> 01:11:11,490
He was a fella to go
where there was trouble.

1003
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:13,592
He was that.

1004
01:11:13,672 --> 01:11:15,895
But, Nell, you know
Malachi was hung.

1005
01:11:15,995 --> 01:11:18,122
Or so some folks told us.

1006
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:23,135
Colonel Crockett. l am
glad you were able...

1007
01:11:23,235 --> 01:11:25,385
...to persuade your men to join us.

1008
01:11:25,485 --> 01:11:27,467
Well, they insisted, sort of.

1009
01:11:27,568 --> 01:11:29,570
Our heartiest welcome.

1010
01:11:30,291 --> 01:11:32,293
Ladies and gentlemen,

1011
01:11:32,373 --> 01:11:35,757
we are proud to welcome
these patriotic men...

1012
01:11:35,857 --> 01:11:39,401
...who have travelled 1 500 miles
to join us in our hour of need.

1013
01:11:39,501 --> 01:11:41,483
Sergeant Lightfoot.
- Yes, sir?

1014
01:11:41,583 --> 01:11:43,012
You will have your men...

1015
01:11:43,112 --> 01:11:45,367
...raise a cheer for
our gallant allies...

1016
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:47,550
...from the illustrious
state of Tennessee.

1017
01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:48,651
Yes, sir.

1018
01:11:48,751 --> 01:11:50,753
Hip. Hip.
- Hooray.

1019
01:11:51,274 --> 01:11:53,276
Hip. Hip.
- Hooray.

1020
01:11:53,516 --> 01:11:55,908
Hip. Hip.
- Hooray.

1021
01:11:56,039 --> 01:11:59,463
Captain, you will attend to
the billeting of these men.

1022
01:11:59,563 --> 01:12:02,945
After you are quartered,
l will take you...

1023
01:12:03,045 --> 01:12:05,390
...on a tour of the emplacements.

1024
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:07,492
This way, gentlemen.

1025
01:12:10,736 --> 01:12:12,778
Crockett. Davy Crockett.

1026
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:18,004
We're from Tennessee.
- Well, howdy, folks.

1027
01:12:18,104 --> 01:12:20,647
We seen you when you came
to Stink Wells...

1028
01:12:20,747 --> 01:12:23,209
...to speak about that
job for the Congress.

1029
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:26,173
You shook hands with me.
- l'll do her again.

1030
01:12:26,273 --> 01:12:28,255
He didn't vote for you, though.

1031
01:12:28,355 --> 01:12:30,938
Other fella gave him four bits.
- l'm sorry.

1032
01:12:31,038 --> 01:12:34,742
Don't be. Glad there were
enough sensible folks like you...

1033
01:12:34,842 --> 01:12:36,825
...to vote me out of that job.

1034
01:12:36,925 --> 01:12:40,028
Well, later on we'll have
a real old home talkfest.

1035
01:12:40,128 --> 01:12:43,266
Right now we've got
to get quartered...

1036
01:12:43,366 --> 01:12:46,770
...and bedded down.
Would you excuse us?

1037
01:12:46,976 --> 01:12:50,124
You should have
voted for him, Jocko.

1038
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:36,341
Of our 24 pieces of ordnance,
five are these six-pounders.

1039
01:13:36,376 --> 01:13:38,939
Something's stirring in town.

1040
01:13:47,789 --> 01:13:49,771
Ladies will take cover, please.

1041
01:13:49,871 --> 01:13:52,424
Men, to your battle positions.

1042
01:14:46,093 --> 01:14:48,836
Captain Dickinson,
are your men disposed?

1043
01:14:48,936 --> 01:14:50,975
At their posts, sir.

1044
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:58,499
No one will fire unless l so order.

1045
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:03,393
Those people are under
the protection of a flag of truce.

1046
01:15:15,326 --> 01:15:17,836
From Generalissimo
Antonio López de

1047
01:15:17,936 --> 01:15:20,592
Santa Anna, absolute
ruler of Mexico,

1048
01:15:20,692 --> 01:15:23,595
to the rebel commander
who deems himself in command...

1049
01:15:23,695 --> 01:15:25,878
...of the rebels
occupying the mission.

1050
01:15:25,978 --> 01:15:27,980
Be it known:

1051
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:30,601
The province of Mexico
known as Texas...

1052
01:15:30,701 --> 01:15:34,401
...has shown itself to be
in active and treasonous revolt...

1053
01:15:34,502 --> 01:15:37,242
...against the rule of
Generalissimo Santa Anna.

1054
01:15:37,342 --> 01:15:39,963
The generalissimo issues
the following order.

1055
01:15:40,063 --> 01:15:43,244
All occupants of the mission
will leave at once,

1056
01:15:43,344 --> 01:15:46,244
leaving all arms
and ammunition behind them.

1057
01:15:46,344 --> 01:15:48,885
lf this order is not followed
with dispatch,

1058
01:15:48,985 --> 01:15:52,086
the generalissimo will reduce
the mission by assault.

1059
01:15:52,186 --> 01:15:54,821
There will be no quarter given.

1060
01:16:27,714 --> 01:16:30,180
Well, what do you think, Jim?

1061
01:16:32,515 --> 01:16:37,701
l hate to say anything good about
that long-winded jackanapes,

1062
01:16:37,956 --> 01:16:41,782
but he does know
the short way to start a war.

1063
01:17:04,803 --> 01:17:06,803
The Sixth...

1064
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:10,729
The Sixth Vera Cruzano Fusiliers.

1065
01:17:14,805 --> 01:17:18,506
They're bivouacking about
a mile south of our west bastion.

1066
01:17:18,606 --> 01:17:21,347
Light artillery,
lancers, some engineers.

1067
01:17:21,447 --> 01:17:24,010
Not one unit of heavy
assault troops yet,

1068
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:26,228
and it still adds up to 2,000 men.

1069
01:17:26,328 --> 01:17:28,468
That'll be to our advantage, Dick.

1070
01:17:28,568 --> 01:17:32,224
That main body must be
strung out for miles.

1071
01:17:32,889 --> 01:17:36,390
The assault infantry,
heavy artillery and supply trains...

1072
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:38,791
They won't be here
for four or five days.

1073
01:17:38,891 --> 01:17:41,471
The actual battle
can't start until then.

1074
01:17:41,571 --> 01:17:45,592
Oh, there'll be an occasional sortie
feeling out our defences.

1075
01:17:45,692 --> 01:17:48,063
But they won't commit
to an attack until

1076
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:50,473
Santa Anna is here
with his main force.

1077
01:17:50,574 --> 01:17:54,362
Then what?
- Then Fannin will be here.

1078
01:17:59,496 --> 01:18:02,216
More troops arriving every hour.

1079
01:18:02,616 --> 01:18:05,415
Prettiest army l ever did see.

1080
01:18:05,537 --> 01:18:07,538
Yeah.

1081
01:18:07,618 --> 01:18:09,878
lf l take my men out,
do you go with me?

1082
01:18:09,978 --> 01:18:11,725
Davy, you know this old mission...

1083
01:18:11,826 --> 01:18:13,679
...can't stand up to
Santa Anna's army.

1084
01:18:13,779 --> 01:18:17,120
My way's the only way.
- Travis says that Fannin's coming.

1085
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:20,442
Travis says. l wouldn't
take Travis's...

1086
01:18:20,542 --> 01:18:24,112
...word that night's
dark and day's light.

1087
01:18:25,262 --> 01:18:26,922
Blowin' on a horn. That's all.

1088
01:18:27,022 --> 01:18:29,403
Chicken in the bread bag,
pickin' up the corn. That's all.

1089
01:18:29,503 --> 01:18:32,723
Flies in the buttermilk.
Shoo, fly, shoo. That's all.

1090
01:18:32,823 --> 01:18:35,324
Ants in the sugar bowl.
Two by two. That's all.

1091
01:18:35,424 --> 01:18:39,335
l carried twice as much.
- You're twice as big.

1092
01:18:40,065 --> 01:18:42,066
Patrol's in trouble.

1093
01:19:00,990 --> 01:19:02,991
Doggone it, Beekeeper.

1094
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:07,092
l thought you wasn't gonna open
that corn liquor till nightfall.

1095
01:19:07,192 --> 01:19:09,912
lt's only a half-hour till dark.

1096
01:19:11,112 --> 01:19:13,093
Besides, it's my keg, ain't it?

1097
01:19:13,193 --> 01:19:15,854
Well, all right. Give
me some of that stuff.

1098
01:19:15,954 --> 01:19:18,254
l'm so scared l could drink all of it.

1099
01:19:18,354 --> 01:19:20,355
Maybe l will.

1100
01:19:20,755 --> 01:19:22,755
What'd you see, lrish?

1101
01:19:22,835 --> 01:19:26,176
More than l wanted to, Jim.
A lot of men arriving.

1102
01:19:26,276 --> 01:19:29,777
And they got the durned
blastedest cannon ever l did see.

1103
01:19:29,877 --> 01:19:31,877
Something like this.

1104
01:19:37,879 --> 01:19:40,089
12 or 1 4 foot long maybe.

1105
01:19:40,199 --> 01:19:43,180
He sure draws pretty, don't he?
- Frightening.

1106
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:46,421
12 or 1 4 feet long.
Are you sure, lrish?

1107
01:19:46,521 --> 01:19:48,521
Well, yeah...
- Finn.

1108
01:19:48,601 --> 01:19:49,662
Yes, sir.

1109
01:19:49,762 --> 01:19:51,416
You were ordered to report to me,

1110
01:19:51,516 --> 01:19:53,582
not to hold lecture
courses. Get up here.

1111
01:19:53,682 --> 01:19:57,278
All right, Will... Colonel Travis.

1112
01:20:00,244 --> 01:20:02,745
Hey, Travis. With
a cannon like that,

1113
01:20:02,845 --> 01:20:05,081
them Santa Anna fellas
can just sit up...

1114
01:20:05,181 --> 01:20:07,306
...there and give us
what for, can't they?

1115
01:20:07,406 --> 01:20:10,266
There's no such cannon
in the North American continent.

1116
01:20:10,366 --> 01:20:13,027
They have some in Europe,
according to last reports.

1117
01:20:13,127 --> 01:20:16,443
Acting Lieutenant
Finn is exaggerating.

1118
01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:25,950
She's a big one, Davy.

1119
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:28,941
And she's shooting
from over here.

1120
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:39,008
Battery One. ls your gun ready?

1121
01:20:39,053 --> 01:20:41,034
We're primed and ready, sir.

1122
01:20:41,134 --> 01:20:42,794
Give it full elevation.

1123
01:20:42,894 --> 01:20:44,895
Yes, sir.

1124
01:20:48,815 --> 01:20:50,816
The gun is ready, sir.

1125
01:20:50,896 --> 01:20:52,896
Fire.

1126
01:21:00,098 --> 01:21:03,329
Kinda short there,
Colonel, Mr Travis.

1127
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:11,517
l'm sure l'm glad l seen
that there cannon...

1128
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:13,521
...sitting out there on that prairie.

1129
01:21:13,621 --> 01:21:16,362
For a minute l thought
they was shooting at us...

1130
01:21:16,462 --> 01:21:18,883
...from one of them countries
over in Europe.

1131
01:21:18,983 --> 01:21:20,983
Oh, my goodness.

1132
01:21:21,063 --> 01:21:23,063
No.

1133
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:26,261
Oh, no. They wouldn't dare.

1134
01:21:26,384 --> 01:21:30,219
Man, that ain't no fair
way to fight a war.

1135
01:21:34,906 --> 01:21:38,607
Well, l guess we'd better do
somethin' about that, Crockett.

1136
01:21:38,707 --> 01:21:41,368
Plain as can be.
- About an hour after dark?

1137
01:21:41,468 --> 01:21:43,468
Good.

1138
01:21:43,788 --> 01:21:45,789
Thimblerig, 1 5 men.

1139
01:21:45,869 --> 01:21:47,869
Right after dark.

1140
01:21:47,949 --> 01:21:49,950
All sober.

1141
01:22:01,392 --> 01:22:03,393
Halt.
- l lost the bet.

1142
01:22:03,473 --> 01:22:06,774
l bet my friends l could sneak up
on you without you hearing me.

1143
01:22:06,874 --> 01:22:10,615
Friend, you like to got
a hole in your head.

1144
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:15,778
Tie him loose.

1145
01:22:15,878 --> 01:22:19,612
Kick that fire out and
kill our silhouette.

1146
01:22:19,837 --> 01:22:22,557
Let's go. Company One, let's go.

1147
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:38,181
Everything set?
- Yes, sir.

1148
01:22:38,281 --> 01:22:40,262
All right. lt's time, men.

1149
01:22:40,362 --> 01:22:44,103
Open the gate.
- Colonel Travis, sentry here.

1150
01:22:44,523 --> 01:22:47,223
Somebody jumped me.
- l'll say they did.

1151
01:22:47,323 --> 01:22:49,265
Shoved me down, tied me up, and...

1152
01:22:49,365 --> 01:22:51,424
...some of them
stepped on me goin' by.

1153
01:22:51,524 --> 01:22:53,219
And never so much as...

1154
01:22:53,319 --> 01:22:56,225
...a by-your-leave from
every one of them.

1155
01:22:56,325 --> 01:22:58,326
Dammit.

1156
01:23:01,807 --> 01:23:03,867
Return to your posts.
- Yes, sir.

1157
01:23:03,967 --> 01:23:05,968
Close the gate.

1158
01:23:08,888 --> 01:23:12,029
Well, you'd better get
your men mounted, then.

1159
01:23:12,129 --> 01:23:14,910
See if you can give them any help.
- Yes, sir.

1160
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:18,003
Detail. Stand to horse.

1161
01:23:39,936 --> 01:23:41,936
Get the powder.

1162
01:23:49,818 --> 01:23:53,389
Where's the mud?
- lt's comin'. Here it is.

1163
01:24:37,829 --> 01:24:39,830
Clear out. l'll cover.

1164
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:43,591
You heard the man.

1165
01:24:48,352 --> 01:24:52,008
Come on, kid. Get outta here.
- l can shoot.

1166
01:24:54,193 --> 01:24:57,594
Golly. What a gun.
- Go on. Grab a horse.

1167
01:25:06,516 --> 01:25:08,517
Cannon party.

1168
01:25:08,597 --> 01:25:11,777
No one will fire until
you can identify your target.

1169
01:25:11,877 --> 01:25:13,878
Yes, sir.

1170
01:25:18,879 --> 01:25:22,365
Let's give 'em a hand,
boys. Knock on it.

1171
01:25:37,243 --> 01:25:39,394
Pick 'em up. Pick 'em up.

1172
01:25:39,524 --> 01:25:43,265
Everybody rides double.
Come on. Pick 'em up.

1173
01:26:04,530 --> 01:26:09,291
Hold the gate. Hold the gate.
- Somebody's still outside.

1174
01:26:16,092 --> 01:26:18,093
Close the gate.

1175
01:26:19,253 --> 01:26:21,254
Good work, Smitty.

1176
01:26:21,334 --> 01:26:23,594
We never missed you.
Good thing the kid did.

1177
01:26:23,694 --> 01:26:25,515
That horse folded with me.

1178
01:26:25,615 --> 01:26:27,315
You all right, Jim?
- Sure.

1179
01:26:27,415 --> 01:26:30,676
Oh, Mr Smith. You've been hurt.
- Oh, it's all right.

1180
01:26:30,776 --> 01:26:32,836
Let's take a look at that.
- Doctor.

1181
01:26:32,936 --> 01:26:34,937
No bones broken.

1182
01:26:35,017 --> 01:26:38,118
All you need is a little
Doctor Beekeeper's fix-all.

1183
01:26:38,218 --> 01:26:40,218
See? l...

1184
01:26:42,179 --> 01:26:44,179
Pretty close.

1185
01:26:44,259 --> 01:26:45,259
Bowie?

1186
01:26:45,359 --> 01:26:48,760
Oh, he's all right.
Turned a horse over.

1187
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:50,971
Jethro?
- Yes, sir.

1188
01:26:51,101 --> 01:26:54,081
Tell Colonel Bowie
l wish to speak to him at once.

1189
01:26:54,181 --> 01:26:56,182
Yes, sir.

1190
01:26:56,262 --> 01:26:59,083
Over here, where we can
have a little privacy.

1191
01:26:59,183 --> 01:27:01,183
Yes, sir.

1192
01:27:17,458 --> 01:27:19,668
Post this area.
- Yes, sir.

1193
01:27:24,419 --> 01:27:27,520
Will, considering the way
things turned out, l...

1194
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:29,621
Dick, leave this to me.

1195
01:27:52,346 --> 01:27:54,346
Colonel Bowie.

1196
01:27:55,347 --> 01:27:59,088
l have had just about
enough insubordination.

1197
01:27:59,428 --> 01:28:01,428
You have?

1198
01:28:01,508 --> 01:28:04,089
All right. Let's get
to it. When and where?

1199
01:28:04,189 --> 01:28:07,290
l hear you're a good shot,
so let's choose pistols.

1200
01:28:07,390 --> 01:28:09,810
l assumed you would choose
the ruffian's knife.

1201
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:12,251
Gentlemen, l beg...
- Dick, act for me.

1202
01:28:12,351 --> 01:28:14,351
Time?

1203
01:28:14,431 --> 01:28:17,237
l suggest after this war is over.

1204
01:28:18,512 --> 01:28:20,513
Yes.

1205
01:28:20,593 --> 01:28:23,333
The minute...
the very minute this war is over.

1206
01:28:23,433 --> 01:28:25,948
Jim?
- That's fine with me.

1207
01:28:26,994 --> 01:28:28,995
One last word, Bowie.

1208
01:28:29,075 --> 01:28:31,055
This evening's episode...

1209
01:28:31,155 --> 01:28:33,213
By going on a mission
without orders...

1210
01:28:33,313 --> 01:28:34,776
...you endangered this command.

1211
01:28:34,876 --> 01:28:36,231
lf it had not been for...

1212
01:28:36,331 --> 01:28:38,417
...the intervention
of Captain Dickinson,

1213
01:28:38,517 --> 01:28:41,538
a large number of volunteers
would now be dead out there...

1214
01:28:41,638 --> 01:28:43,618
...instead of at their posts in here.

1215
01:28:43,718 --> 01:28:45,548
l demand your word of honour that...

1216
01:28:45,648 --> 01:28:47,739
...there will no repetition
of such conduct.

1217
01:28:47,839 --> 01:28:51,750
Or else l shall be forced
to order your arrest.

1218
01:28:55,721 --> 01:28:57,721
Travis...

1219
01:28:58,402 --> 01:29:03,163
Don't you worry any more
about arrest or insubordination.

1220
01:29:03,883 --> 01:29:06,689
l take my people out at daybreak.

1221
01:29:13,925 --> 01:29:15,926
Colonel Travis...

1222
01:29:16,006 --> 01:29:18,006
...l'm an old man...

1223
01:29:18,086 --> 01:29:20,087
...but you're wrong.

1224
01:29:24,888 --> 01:29:26,888
That Jethro...

1225
01:29:27,568 --> 01:29:29,609
Reminds me of a story...

1226
01:29:29,649 --> 01:29:31,649
Please, Crockett.

1227
01:29:31,729 --> 01:29:34,990
No homespun wisdom.
No cracker-barrel philosophy.

1228
01:29:35,090 --> 01:29:37,311
None of the backwoods wit...

1229
01:29:37,411 --> 01:29:40,511
...for which you are
famous. Good night.

1230
01:29:40,611 --> 01:29:43,352
You'd better slack
off on me, mister.

1231
01:29:43,452 --> 01:29:46,713
This code of honour business
doesn't bother me a bit.

1232
01:29:46,813 --> 01:29:49,554
When there's trouble
l come from any direction...

1233
01:29:49,654 --> 01:29:51,634
...as sudden and
surprising as l can.

1234
01:29:51,734 --> 01:29:55,648
My only concern here
is 23 Tennesseans.

1235
01:29:55,775 --> 01:29:59,771
So you'd better let me know
what's in your mind.

1236
01:30:00,976 --> 01:30:05,397
l'd have thought that would
have been obvious to you.

1237
01:30:07,258 --> 01:30:09,726
lt's as simple as this.

1238
01:30:09,858 --> 01:30:12,976
There's Santa Anna
with 7,000 men.

1239
01:30:13,099 --> 01:30:15,489
Up here is the Sabine River.

1240
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:17,620
Somewhere around here

1241
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:20,441
Sam Houston is trying
to organise an army.

1242
01:30:20,541 --> 01:30:24,581
And right in between...
is the Alamo.

1243
01:30:24,702 --> 01:30:27,012
Santa Anna can't go
around and leave...

1244
01:30:27,112 --> 01:30:29,483
...a fort along his
lines of communication.

1245
01:30:29,583 --> 01:30:31,643
He must reduce the
Alamo by storm.

1246
01:30:31,744 --> 01:30:34,564
Every minute of time
we buy for Sam Houston...

1247
01:30:34,664 --> 01:30:37,765
...is another precious minute
in the life of Texas.

1248
01:30:37,865 --> 01:30:41,526
And nobody is ever going to say
that William Barret Travis...

1249
01:30:41,626 --> 01:30:44,772
...did not buy every
minute possible.

1250
01:30:45,227 --> 01:30:48,047
Makes sense.
Why didn't you tell Bowie that?

1251
01:30:48,147 --> 01:30:51,288
A commander does not have
to explain his every decision.

1252
01:30:51,388 --> 01:30:53,389
You explained to me.

1253
01:30:54,269 --> 01:30:56,489
l have great respect
for you, Crockett.

1254
01:30:56,589 --> 01:31:00,530
But l have none for that
knife-fighting adventurer.

1255
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:04,811
l figured any fella that shouldered
a gun was deserving of respect.

1256
01:31:04,911 --> 01:31:08,951
But then l'm not... a real soldier.

1257
01:31:09,072 --> 01:31:11,853
l never fought anybody but lnjuns.

1258
01:31:11,953 --> 01:31:13,933
Less'n you count the British.

1259
01:31:14,033 --> 01:31:16,034
Crockett.

1260
01:31:18,835 --> 01:31:23,376
l must ask you to forgive
my rudeness earlier on to you.

1261
01:31:23,476 --> 01:31:27,265
l'm an easy forgiver... at times.

1262
01:31:27,397 --> 01:31:29,397
Good night, Travis.

1263
01:31:48,402 --> 01:31:51,382
Crack out a couple of jugs
and bring that guitar.

1264
01:31:51,482 --> 01:31:53,463
What are we gonna do, Davy?

1265
01:31:53,563 --> 01:31:55,563
Serenade.

1266
01:32:07,966 --> 01:32:09,346
Well...

1267
01:32:09,446 --> 01:32:11,864
...l hope you told that
long-winded idiot...

1268
01:32:11,964 --> 01:32:13,147
...what you think of him.

1269
01:32:13,247 --> 01:32:16,805
l'm not rightly sure
what l think of him.

1270
01:32:16,905 --> 01:32:18,906
What's all this?

1271
01:32:19,169 --> 01:32:23,190
Well, l figured we'd crack a jug
and tell each other our troubles.

1272
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:25,270
Now wait a minute, Crockett.

1273
01:32:25,370 --> 01:32:28,551
Don't try your winnin' ways on me.
My mind's made up.

1274
01:32:28,651 --> 01:32:31,312
Well, we can have a farewell drink.

1275
01:32:31,412 --> 01:32:33,452
You mean you're stayin'?

1276
01:32:33,492 --> 01:32:35,703
That's what l figure, Jim.

1277
01:32:36,093 --> 01:32:38,753
All right. We'll have
a drink or two or ten.

1278
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:41,954
But you ain't gonna get me drunk
and change my mind.

1279
01:32:42,054 --> 01:32:44,055
Of course not.

1280
01:32:50,967 --> 01:32:52,968
Water patrol. Let's go.

1281
01:32:53,048 --> 01:32:55,598
Rise and shine. Up and at 'em.

1282
01:32:56,128 --> 01:32:58,109
Beekeeper, come on. Show a leg.

1283
01:32:58,209 --> 01:33:00,209
Get out of there.

1284
01:33:00,209 --> 01:33:02,510
Thimblerig, come
on. lt's your duty.

1285
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:05,511
lt's your duty.
- You don't have to wake us all.

1286
01:33:05,611 --> 01:33:09,947
l'll get 'em up, Sergeant.
- Thanks, Parson. Thanks.

1287
01:33:11,692 --> 01:33:13,693
Hey.

1288
01:33:13,773 --> 01:33:16,673
Two dollars American
if you take out my patrol.

1289
01:33:16,773 --> 01:33:20,634
Two dollars? This morning
l wouldn't take your patrol for ten.

1290
01:33:20,734 --> 01:33:23,965
l would.
- Got yourself a deal, Scotty.

1291
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:32,677
Well, Davy, it looks
like you done it again.

1292
01:33:33,937 --> 01:33:35,938
lt do.

1293
01:33:36,898 --> 01:33:40,369
And Bowie?
- Looked like a tie to me.

1294
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:48,181
Your duty.

1295
01:34:16,627 --> 01:34:19,448
Good morning, Colonel.
He's still sleepin'.

1296
01:34:19,548 --> 01:34:22,184
l'll take care of that, Jethro.

1297
01:34:27,070 --> 01:34:29,070
Hey.

1298
01:34:34,071 --> 01:34:36,072
Crockett.

1299
01:34:37,072 --> 01:34:39,073
Crockett.

1300
01:34:42,353 --> 01:34:45,974
Crockett, what the devil...
- Good morning, Smitty. Doc.

1301
01:34:46,074 --> 01:34:48,075
Davy.
- Good morning.

1302
01:34:48,515 --> 01:34:50,515
Well.

1303
01:34:50,595 --> 01:34:51,986
You got yourself famous.

1304
01:34:52,086 --> 01:34:54,136
Now when they talk
about Jim Bowie,

1305
01:34:54,236 --> 01:34:55,978
they'll tell about the man that...

1306
01:34:56,078 --> 01:34:57,977
...pulled him out from
under the troops.

1307
01:34:58,077 --> 01:34:59,698
Gee. Will they?

1308
01:34:59,798 --> 01:35:03,138
Jim, the kid wants to know
about that sand bar episode.

1309
01:35:03,238 --> 01:35:05,659
Oh, come on, Crockett.
- That's the truth.

1310
01:35:05,759 --> 01:35:08,002
He's never heard
anything but hearsay.

1311
01:35:08,103 --> 01:35:09,260
Gosh, yes, Mr Bowie.

1312
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:12,286
All the fellas back
home talk about...

1313
01:35:12,387 --> 01:35:13,981
By the way, Smitty...

1314
01:35:14,081 --> 01:35:16,676
Say goodbye to Jim.

1315
01:35:18,122 --> 01:35:21,523
Are you going someplace,
Colonel... Jim?

1316
01:35:23,003 --> 01:35:25,120
No.

1317
01:35:25,244 --> 01:35:26,827
No, l'm not goin' noplace.

1318
01:35:26,927 --> 01:35:29,264
That's just Crockett's
idea of a joke.

1319
01:35:29,365 --> 01:35:31,345
Now you get well, Smitty, boy.

1320
01:35:31,445 --> 01:35:33,570
And thanks for your help.

1321
01:35:45,968 --> 01:35:48,989
What are you doin'?
- lt was rumoured we were leavin'.

1322
01:35:49,089 --> 01:35:53,850
l'll tell you when we're leaving.
Get that gear put away.

1323
01:35:55,211 --> 01:35:57,211
Crockett.

1324
01:36:22,417 --> 01:36:24,557
By God, boy. You're bad-tempered.

1325
01:36:24,658 --> 01:36:27,558
Don't you ever try to make
a fool out of me again.

1326
01:36:27,658 --> 01:36:30,039
Once is enough.
- l make up my own mind.

1327
01:36:30,139 --> 01:36:32,604
Never thought otherwise, Jim.

1328
01:36:32,739 --> 01:36:35,210
l was wondering... You
think there'd be...

1329
01:36:35,310 --> 01:36:37,360
...a mouthful of that
corn juice left?

1330
01:36:37,461 --> 01:36:40,681
We could kinda
cut the tar out of our throats.

1331
01:36:40,781 --> 01:36:43,501
That's a great idea, Davy.

1332
01:36:43,622 --> 01:36:45,622
That's a great idea.

1333
01:36:47,863 --> 01:36:50,584
l still say you're bad-tempered.

1334
01:36:59,207 --> 01:37:01,207
Halt. Who goes there?

1335
01:37:02,807 --> 01:37:04,808
Don't shoot, amigo.

1336
01:37:05,688 --> 01:37:07,729
A message for Jim Bowie.

1337
01:37:09,249 --> 01:37:11,249
ln the sombrero.

1338
01:37:18,411 --> 01:37:19,711
Jim.

1339
01:37:19,811 --> 01:37:23,892
Fella says there's a message
in this hat for you.

1340
01:37:26,773 --> 01:37:30,394
Kind of a strange way
to be sending messages, ain't it?

1341
01:37:30,494 --> 01:37:32,644
Yeah.

1342
01:37:32,775 --> 01:37:35,240
Maybe Santa Anna surrendered.

1343
01:38:20,106 --> 01:38:22,106
What is it, Jim?

1344
01:38:25,347 --> 01:38:27,327
l never... knew the night...

1345
01:38:27,427 --> 01:38:29,428
...could be so dark.

1346
01:38:34,069 --> 01:38:36,069
My... my wife...

1347
01:38:38,710 --> 01:38:40,710
She...

1348
01:38:41,191 --> 01:38:43,191
She's... dead.

1349
01:38:52,113 --> 01:38:54,154
l lived through it, Jim.

1350
01:38:56,194 --> 01:38:58,195
lt's hard.

1351
01:38:59,515 --> 01:39:01,515
lt was the plague.

1352
01:39:02,716 --> 01:39:04,716
The damn plague.

1353
01:39:06,877 --> 01:39:08,877
Oh, God, dear God.

1354
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:20,320
Oh, Davy... she...

1355
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:22,760
She was so small.

1356
01:39:23,721 --> 01:39:26,030
So tiny. So very tiny.

1357
01:39:28,362 --> 01:39:32,303
She wanted to stay in Bexar
to be near me, but...

1358
01:39:32,403 --> 01:39:34,868
...l made her go to Coahuila.

1359
01:39:36,124 --> 01:39:38,124
l made her go.

1360
01:39:40,365 --> 01:39:42,365
My man Parson...

1361
01:39:44,526 --> 01:39:46,736
He's a kind of a preacher.

1362
01:39:47,846 --> 01:39:49,847
He keeps sayin'

1363
01:39:51,087 --> 01:39:53,298
little do we mortals know.

1364
01:40:00,689 --> 01:40:02,690
Hold your head up, Jim.

1365
01:40:07,011 --> 01:40:08,311
Colonel Bowie...

1366
01:40:08,411 --> 01:40:11,312
You've had a communication
from outside these walls.

1367
01:40:11,412 --> 01:40:13,392
This is against my orders.

1368
01:40:13,492 --> 01:40:16,468
What information
have you received?

1369
01:40:17,933 --> 01:40:20,229
Bowie, hand me that letter.

1370
01:40:25,135 --> 01:40:27,411
You may die tonight.

1371
01:40:28,576 --> 01:40:30,576
That little lady, Jim.

1372
01:40:31,297 --> 01:40:33,297
She won't like it.

1373
01:41:09,746 --> 01:41:11,746
Colonel Bowie...

1374
01:41:12,146 --> 01:41:15,632
Please accept
my most profound sympathy...

1375
01:41:16,347 --> 01:41:21,278
...and my regret for having
disturbed you at such a moment.

1376
01:41:21,908 --> 01:41:25,469
This in no way impairs
your right to call...

1377
01:41:25,569 --> 01:41:29,395
...me on the field of
honour at a later date.

1378
01:41:34,631 --> 01:41:38,202
But l wish to express
my sorrow for you...

1379
01:41:38,792 --> 01:41:44,064
...and present my apology for
being such a boor at such a time.

1380
01:41:45,354 --> 01:41:47,663
Travis...

1381
01:41:47,794 --> 01:41:50,090
You can't help bein' you...

1382
01:41:51,955 --> 01:41:54,421
...and l can't help bein' me.

1383
01:42:19,457 --> 01:42:24,198
What's that all about, Sergeant?
- 32 cases hospitalised today, sir.

1384
01:42:24,298 --> 01:42:28,039
Well... Tell 'em to move over
after last night's party...

1385
01:42:28,139 --> 01:42:30,860
Oh, no, sir. Women and children.

1386
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:34,380
Another officers' call.

1387
01:42:35,781 --> 01:42:38,081
See for yourself. lt's all like that.

1388
01:42:38,181 --> 01:42:40,182
Sir.

1389
01:42:40,302 --> 01:42:42,302
Gentlemen.

1390
01:42:43,263 --> 01:42:46,083
Doctor.
- lt's as simple as this, gentlemen.

1391
01:42:46,183 --> 01:42:49,164
l had 32 cases
of mild dysentery this morning.

1392
01:42:49,264 --> 01:42:51,549
l tested the salt pork
barrel the rations...

1393
01:42:51,650 --> 01:42:53,245
...were issued from. lt's tainted.

1394
01:42:53,345 --> 01:42:55,685
So is every other barrel
in the warehouse.

1395
01:42:55,785 --> 01:42:56,886
Sergeant.

1396
01:42:56,986 --> 01:42:59,126
Barring the pork, l figure we have...

1397
01:42:59,226 --> 01:43:04,327
...three or four days' full rations
to serve to the garrison.

1398
01:43:05,188 --> 01:43:07,688
You see the dilemma, gentlemen.

1399
01:43:07,788 --> 01:43:09,809
We are almost out of food.

1400
01:43:09,909 --> 01:43:13,890
However, Santa Anna does not
suffer under the same handicap.

1401
01:43:13,990 --> 01:43:16,490
Therefore our course is obvious.

1402
01:43:16,590 --> 01:43:18,591
lf you'll follow me.

1403
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:01,609
l can think of more
comfortable places...

1404
01:44:01,709 --> 01:44:02,981
...to watch that show from.

1405
01:44:03,081 --> 01:44:05,082
Quiet.

1406
01:44:26,807 --> 01:44:28,807
Dick.

1407
01:44:28,887 --> 01:44:30,888
Yes, sir?

1408
01:44:33,128 --> 01:44:35,594
lt's a half-hour to daybreak.

1409
01:44:35,729 --> 01:44:37,709
Have your men stand to horse.

1410
01:44:37,809 --> 01:44:39,810
Yes, sir.

1411
01:46:23,434 --> 01:46:25,435
The night herders.

1412
01:46:25,515 --> 01:46:27,515
Two to each one of 'em.

1413
01:46:27,595 --> 01:46:30,576
Don't miss.
There'll be a lot of hungry kids.

1414
01:46:30,676 --> 01:46:32,676
Take 'em.

1415
01:46:32,757 --> 01:46:34,873
Smitty.

1416
01:46:36,877 --> 01:46:39,618
Grab a horse off that picket line
for Smitty.

1417
01:46:39,718 --> 01:46:41,719
Get a good one.

1418
01:46:41,799 --> 01:46:43,799
Colonel Davy?

1419
01:46:43,799 --> 01:46:46,460
Can l ask you fellas
something face to face?

1420
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:48,560
Sure thing, kid.

1421
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:50,535
Are you really sending me because...

1422
01:46:50,635 --> 01:46:52,421
...l'm a good horseman
like you said?

1423
01:46:52,521 --> 01:46:54,522
As l live and breathe.

1424
01:46:54,522 --> 01:46:56,040
You're smarter than Beekeeper...

1425
01:46:56,140 --> 01:46:57,902
...and you swim better
than the gambler.

1426
01:46:58,002 --> 01:46:59,763
lt ain't that you don't think l'd be...

1427
01:46:59,863 --> 01:47:01,623
...worth my salt when
the fighting starts?

1428
01:47:01,723 --> 01:47:03,824
Smitty, let me tell you something.

1429
01:47:03,924 --> 01:47:06,485
Of all the men in this
outfit, l'd pick you...

1430
01:47:06,585 --> 01:47:08,465
...to side me if the goin' was rough.

1431
01:47:08,565 --> 01:47:10,565
You see?
- Gee.

1432
01:47:11,166 --> 01:47:13,166
Get on this horse.

1433
01:47:16,887 --> 01:47:19,467
There's nothing out there,
kid, but dark.

1434
01:47:19,568 --> 01:47:21,568
Good luck, Smitty.

1435
01:47:26,489 --> 01:47:29,470
lt'll take him quite a few days
to get to Houston.

1436
01:47:29,570 --> 01:47:32,563
That's what l figured.

1437
01:47:45,574 --> 01:47:47,714
The south side's all taken care of.

1438
01:47:47,814 --> 01:47:49,815
Get a horse.

1439
01:47:51,975 --> 01:47:54,186
Now all we can do is wait.

1440
01:47:55,016 --> 01:47:57,056
That's the hardest part.

1441
01:47:57,096 --> 01:47:59,097
lt sure is.

1442
01:48:01,617 --> 01:48:04,371
Column halt.

1443
01:48:05,938 --> 01:48:07,939
Carry on, Dick.

1444
01:48:08,019 --> 01:48:09,999
Good luck.
- Thank you, Will.

1445
01:48:10,099 --> 01:48:12,534
Best of luck, Dickinson.

1446
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:14,662
Forward, yo-ho.

1447
01:48:33,956 --> 01:48:38,720
lf they don't shoot pretty quick,
we've got to go anyway.

1448
01:48:49,448 --> 01:48:51,599
Let's take 'em.

1449
01:50:10,709 --> 01:50:12,711
Hold your fire.

1450
01:50:13,831 --> 01:50:15,092
Hold your fire.

1451
01:50:15,192 --> 01:50:17,194
Pick your targets.

1452
01:50:17,274 --> 01:50:18,815
Fire.

1453
01:50:18,915 --> 01:50:20,917
Fire at will.

1454
01:50:30,124 --> 01:50:32,125
Second rank, fire.

1455
01:50:32,245 --> 01:50:34,522
Fall back. Fall back.

1456
01:50:39,346 --> 01:50:41,347
Fall back.

1457
01:51:03,324 --> 01:51:04,425
Fire.

1458
01:51:04,525 --> 01:51:06,026
Fall back.

1459
01:51:06,126 --> 01:51:07,547
Second rank.

1460
01:51:07,647 --> 01:51:09,958
Fire.

1461
01:51:10,089 --> 01:51:12,090
Fall back.

1462
01:51:14,292 --> 01:51:16,294
Third rank.

1463
01:51:16,374 --> 01:51:17,995
Ready?

1464
01:51:18,095 --> 01:51:20,096
Fire.

1465
01:51:28,022 --> 01:51:30,024
Cease fire.

1466
01:51:39,551 --> 01:51:41,553
Close the gate.

1467
01:51:41,633 --> 01:51:43,943
There's one thing for sure.

1468
01:51:44,074 --> 01:51:46,056
He's a bearcat for nerve.

1469
01:51:46,156 --> 01:51:48,158
l'm grateful for that.

1470
01:51:48,238 --> 01:51:52,181
l'd hate to look at a coward
over a duellin' pistol.

1471
01:51:52,281 --> 01:51:56,464
You're not much for this forgive
and forget business, are you, Jim?

1472
01:51:56,564 --> 01:51:58,565
No.

1473
01:52:17,019 --> 01:52:19,021
Beef for supper.

1474
01:52:19,101 --> 01:52:21,102
Yes, sir.

1475
01:52:25,506 --> 01:52:28,368
Hog never rightly
could pass for meat.

1476
01:52:28,468 --> 01:52:30,469
But beef.

1477
01:52:39,651 --> 01:52:41,962
The big he-bull himself.

1478
01:52:42,093 --> 01:52:44,131
Let's go.

1479
01:52:44,255 --> 01:52:46,256
Ladies to cover.

1480
01:52:46,256 --> 01:52:48,772
Men to your posts.

1481
01:53:18,681 --> 01:53:20,662
Captain Dickinson.
- Yes, sir.

1482
01:53:20,762 --> 01:53:24,105
Order all men fed in relays.
Full issue of ammunition.

1483
01:53:24,205 --> 01:53:26,207
Yes, sir.

1484
01:53:33,092 --> 01:53:35,954
That's the best-dressed
army l ever saw.

1485
01:53:36,054 --> 01:53:38,556
Fancy clothes don't
make a fightin' man.

1486
01:53:38,656 --> 01:53:41,678
They're just off two years
puttin' down revolts.

1487
01:53:41,778 --> 01:53:43,780
They're fightin' men.

1488
01:54:20,487 --> 01:54:22,412
Generalissimo Santa
Anna has just...

1489
01:54:22,512 --> 01:54:24,711
...arrived with the main
body of his army...

1490
01:54:24,811 --> 01:54:26,792
...and has only
now become aware...

1491
01:54:26,892 --> 01:54:29,634
...that there are women
and children in the mission.

1492
01:54:29,734 --> 01:54:32,517
He wishes that the ladies
receive his apologies...

1493
01:54:32,617 --> 01:54:35,479
...and be informed he has
never attacked a position...

1494
01:54:35,579 --> 01:54:38,441
...without the enemy
being given the opportunity...

1495
01:54:38,541 --> 01:54:40,563
...to evacuate women and children.

1496
01:54:40,663 --> 01:54:43,025
According, you have
one hour in which...

1497
01:54:43,126 --> 01:54:45,126
...to evacuate these
noncombatants...

1498
01:54:45,226 --> 01:54:47,808
...who will be provided
with transport...

1499
01:54:47,908 --> 01:54:51,051
...to proceed to such destination
as is their choice.

1500
01:54:51,151 --> 01:54:54,413
Signed: Antonio López
de Santa Anna, ruler of Mexico.

1501
01:54:54,513 --> 01:54:56,515
Your answer?

1502
01:55:00,998 --> 01:55:04,020
My compliments to the general
for his gallantry.

1503
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:07,098
We will evacuate
our noncombatants.

1504
01:55:19,332 --> 01:55:22,114
Single men will remain
at their posts.

1505
01:55:22,214 --> 01:55:26,722
Married men will arrange
transport for their families.

1506
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:00,193
Sue, you'd better hurry.
- She won't go.

1507
01:56:00,323 --> 01:56:04,426
Save your breath, Will.
Your ever so persuasive breath.

1508
01:56:04,526 --> 01:56:06,527
All right, say it.

1509
01:56:06,608 --> 01:56:09,430
lt's a sorry man
that can't make his wife obey.

1510
01:56:09,530 --> 01:56:12,512
You seem to forget, Dick,
that l too am married.

1511
01:56:12,612 --> 01:56:15,354
l've got to do what l think
is the right thing.

1512
01:56:15,454 --> 01:56:18,637
l'm a soldier's wife.
My child is a soldier's child.

1513
01:56:18,737 --> 01:56:20,738
We'll stay.

1514
01:56:20,818 --> 01:56:22,970
Very well, Sue.

1515
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:25,101
Dick.

1516
01:56:25,182 --> 01:56:27,183
Don't be angry with me.

1517
01:56:27,263 --> 01:56:29,265
l'm not angry.

1518
01:56:29,345 --> 01:56:31,346
l'm proud.

1519
01:56:34,629 --> 01:56:37,521
Dick, take your patrol.
- Yes, sir.

1520
01:56:40,713 --> 01:56:43,605
Married men, return to your posts.

1521
01:56:43,716 --> 01:56:45,717
Open the gate.

1522
01:56:45,797 --> 01:56:47,799
Captain Dickinson.

1523
01:56:47,879 --> 01:56:49,880
Escort. Forward.

1524
01:56:59,167 --> 01:57:01,649
Ma'am, l ain't got no woman to say...

1525
01:57:01,749 --> 01:57:04,231
...goodbye to. Could
l tell you goodbye?

1526
01:57:04,331 --> 01:57:06,333
Surely.

1527
01:57:07,213 --> 01:57:09,215
Get up, boy.

1528
01:57:13,298 --> 01:57:15,299
Jocko, Nell.

1529
01:57:15,339 --> 01:57:17,341
lt's time.

1530
01:57:36,675 --> 01:57:39,568
Go on, Jocko. Do the best you can.

1531
01:57:53,528 --> 01:57:55,530
l can't.

1532
01:57:59,973 --> 01:58:01,975
l can't.

1533
01:58:06,018 --> 01:58:07,999
l just can't do it, fellas.

1534
01:58:08,099 --> 01:58:10,101
Colonel Bowie.

1535
01:58:11,061 --> 01:58:13,163
This is a request and not an order.

1536
01:58:13,263 --> 01:58:16,445
But l suggest that,
as desperate as our needs are,

1537
01:58:16,546 --> 01:58:19,863
that family's needs
are more desperate.

1538
01:58:21,189 --> 01:58:25,532
Get in that line, Jocko,
and move out with your people.

1539
01:58:25,632 --> 01:58:27,634
You can see how it is.

1540
01:58:27,714 --> 01:58:29,695
lt's more than a man can bear.

1541
01:58:29,796 --> 01:58:32,589
She's never said a word
of pity for herself...

1542
01:58:32,689 --> 01:58:34,739
...in the ten years she's been blind.

1543
01:58:34,839 --> 01:58:37,501
Will Travis.
Just who do you think you are?

1544
01:58:37,601 --> 01:58:40,621
Mrs Robertson, l can
assure you that no...

1545
01:58:40,721 --> 01:58:43,666
...blame will attach
itself to your husband.

1546
01:58:43,766 --> 01:58:47,549
Get movin', Jocko, or l'll help you
along with the toe of my boot.

1547
01:58:47,649 --> 01:58:50,831
Shut up, Jim Bowie.
And you and Travis listen close.

1548
01:58:50,932 --> 01:58:53,099
My man ain't goin' out.
He's just as much...

1549
01:58:53,199 --> 01:58:55,115
...a man as either one
of you. Maybe more.

1550
01:58:55,215 --> 01:58:57,476
ln spite of he ain't
rich like you, Jim,

1551
01:58:57,577 --> 01:58:59,838
or fancy educated like
you, Will Travis.

1552
01:58:59,938 --> 01:59:02,480
Now, Jocko, you get
back up on that wall.

1553
01:59:02,580 --> 01:59:06,083
Cos you're just as good as
any man that ever trod leather.

1554
01:59:06,183 --> 01:59:08,185
And it's your right.

1555
01:59:08,265 --> 01:59:10,836
And l can't see, but
l'm just as good...

1556
01:59:10,936 --> 01:59:12,328
...as any woman in Texas.

1557
01:59:12,428 --> 01:59:15,410
And it's my right to
go and leave you.

1558
01:59:15,510 --> 01:59:17,474
Now we've cuddled nice and said...

1559
01:59:17,574 --> 01:59:19,893
...all our goodbyes,
but l'll say it again.

1560
01:59:19,993 --> 01:59:21,975
We'd be fools not to face it.

1561
01:59:22,075 --> 01:59:25,217
You're likely to go and get
yourself killed in this battle.

1562
01:59:25,317 --> 01:59:28,860
l don't know what you're going
to say at the gates of heaven,

1563
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:31,513
but l'm going to say
no woman ever lived...

1564
01:59:31,613 --> 01:59:33,864
...had herself a better
husband than you.

1565
01:59:33,964 --> 01:59:35,965
Now go on.

1566
01:59:47,814 --> 01:59:49,932
Hip. Hip.
- Hooray.

1567
01:59:50,657 --> 01:59:52,658
Hip. Hip.
- Hooray.

1568
01:59:52,778 --> 01:59:55,499
Hip. Hip.
- Hooray.

1569
02:00:37,980 --> 02:00:39,982
Captain Dickinson.

1570
02:00:41,063 --> 02:00:42,444
Yes, sir.

1571
02:00:42,544 --> 02:00:45,166
Have the Doctor set up
the hospital in the chapel.

1572
02:00:45,266 --> 02:00:48,248
You will take charge
of Battery No.4.

1573
02:00:48,348 --> 02:00:50,350
Yes, sir.

1574
02:01:56,119 --> 02:01:58,121
Hold your fire.

1575
02:01:58,361 --> 02:02:00,362
Hold your fire.

1576
02:02:05,086 --> 02:02:07,087
Take 'em.

1577
02:02:31,466 --> 02:02:33,507
Straight frontal attack.

1578
02:02:33,547 --> 02:02:35,624
We need more men up here.

1579
02:02:35,724 --> 02:02:38,957
l'll get some strength
from Dickinson.

1580
02:02:55,684 --> 02:02:57,961
North wall. Hurry it up.

1581
02:03:01,649 --> 02:03:04,211
Who is it?
- lt's the Parson.

1582
02:03:49,925 --> 02:03:51,927
Hold your fire.

1583
02:03:52,007 --> 02:03:55,046
Hold your fire. They're retiring.

1584
02:04:13,798 --> 02:04:15,780
See did any of our boys get hurt.

1585
02:04:15,880 --> 02:04:21,516
l'll be below gettin' washed on
the outside and wet down inside.

1586
02:04:21,644 --> 02:04:23,645
We've been lucky today.

1587
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:29,010
Check the damage.

1588
02:04:29,090 --> 02:04:31,642
Officers' call in ten minutes.

1589
02:04:33,253 --> 02:04:35,254
Bring on another.

1590
02:05:13,283 --> 02:05:16,260
Sure killed many
a brave man today.

1591
02:05:17,286 --> 02:05:19,923
lt's funny. l was proud of 'em.

1592
02:05:20,809 --> 02:05:24,807
Even while l was killin' 'em
l was proud of 'em.

1593
02:05:25,372 --> 02:05:28,795
Speaks well for men
that so many ain't afraid to die...

1594
02:05:28,895 --> 02:05:32,647
...because they think
right's on their side.

1595
02:05:32,747 --> 02:05:34,748
Speaks well.

1596
02:05:41,985 --> 02:05:45,007
Post this area, Lightfoot.
- lt's already done.

1597
02:05:45,107 --> 02:05:47,108
All right, Sergeant.

1598
02:05:47,189 --> 02:05:49,190
Report.
- 50 casualties.

1599
02:05:49,270 --> 02:05:51,832
28 dead, 22 wounded.

1600
02:05:51,952 --> 02:05:54,070
Morale... high.

1601
02:05:54,194 --> 02:05:56,119
Morale ain't gonna help us much...

1602
02:05:56,219 --> 02:05:58,377
...if Fannin don't
get here... and quick.

1603
02:05:58,477 --> 02:06:00,479
Doc.
- Quit squawking.

1604
02:06:00,559 --> 02:06:02,354
You oughta be laying
on your back.

1605
02:06:02,454 --> 02:06:03,381
You'll never walk.

1606
02:06:03,481 --> 02:06:05,527
Santa Anna didn't
have much respect...

1607
02:06:05,627 --> 02:06:07,344
...for us today, and he got burned.

1608
02:06:07,444 --> 02:06:09,164
Now he's gonna be comin' at us...

1609
02:06:09,264 --> 02:06:11,307
...with a battle plan
from all four sides.

1610
02:06:11,407 --> 02:06:13,314
We already been cut
down by a third.

1611
02:06:13,414 --> 02:06:15,430
How long do you think
we can hold out?

1612
02:06:15,530 --> 02:06:17,832
Santa Anna won't
attack again today.

1613
02:06:17,932 --> 02:06:20,674
He'll clear the field of
all the dead and wounded.

1614
02:06:20,774 --> 02:06:23,796
Fannin will be here by tomorrow,
even without a forced march.

1615
02:06:23,896 --> 02:06:25,898
With his 500 men...

1616
02:06:25,978 --> 02:06:28,039
...we can hold this fort for a month.

1617
02:06:28,139 --> 02:06:30,721
500? l thought it was a thousand.

1618
02:06:30,821 --> 02:06:34,499
500.
- Bonham's approaching, sir.

1619
02:06:34,624 --> 02:06:37,858
Good. Fannin should
be close behind.

1620
02:06:49,796 --> 02:06:51,417
Well?

1621
02:06:51,517 --> 02:06:53,659
Colonel Fannin isn't comin'.

1622
02:06:53,759 --> 02:06:56,481
His men were
ambushed. Murdered.

1623
02:06:57,281 --> 02:06:59,323
There won't be any help.

1624
02:07:02,685 --> 02:07:06,513
Have all volunteers
assembled in the compound.

1625
02:07:11,612 --> 02:07:12,793
Well, that's it.

1626
02:07:12,893 --> 02:07:15,795
l'm taking my men out.
Cut through to the North.

1627
02:07:15,895 --> 02:07:17,897
You comin'?

1628
02:07:22,140 --> 02:07:25,543
lt seems like the
better part of valour.

1629
02:07:53,204 --> 02:07:55,205
Men...

1630
02:07:55,886 --> 02:07:58,548
Jim Bonham has brought
news as sad as death.

1631
02:07:58,648 --> 02:08:02,405
Colonel Fannin
has been ambushed.

1632
02:08:02,531 --> 02:08:05,491
We can expect no help.

1633
02:08:05,613 --> 02:08:08,004
l stay here with my command.

1634
02:08:09,456 --> 02:08:13,879
But any of you who wish to
may leave with all honour.

1635
02:08:14,259 --> 02:08:18,087
Failing reinforcements,
the Alamo cannot hold.

1636
02:08:19,423 --> 02:08:22,316
But do not go with
heads hung low.

1637
02:08:23,186 --> 02:08:26,249
No man can criticise
your behaviour.

1638
02:08:27,389 --> 02:08:29,541
Here on these ramparts...

1639
02:08:31,032 --> 02:08:35,135
...you have bought a priceless
ten days of time for Houston.

1640
02:08:35,235 --> 02:08:37,702
You have bled the enemy army.

1641
02:08:38,278 --> 02:08:41,085
You are brave and noble soldiers.

1642
02:08:42,401 --> 02:08:44,402
Open the gate.

1643
02:08:47,244 --> 02:08:49,246
May God bless you.

1644
02:10:44,052 --> 02:10:46,054
Close the gate.

1645
02:11:02,666 --> 02:11:04,367
Hold up there, bub.

1646
02:11:04,467 --> 02:11:07,209
You're in dangerous territory.
Where you headin'?

1647
02:11:07,309 --> 02:11:09,433
l'm lookin' for
General Sam Houston.

1648
02:11:09,533 --> 02:11:10,812
Got a message for him.

1649
02:11:10,912 --> 02:11:13,213
Well, you've come
to the right place.

1650
02:11:13,314 --> 02:11:16,121
Corporal of the guard. Post No.3.

1651
02:11:17,277 --> 02:11:19,778
What is it?
- He wants to see General Sam.

1652
02:11:19,878 --> 02:11:21,880
Come on, bub.

1653
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:51,567
The lad has a message
for the general.

1654
02:11:51,667 --> 02:11:52,803
Yes, sir.

1655
02:11:52,903 --> 02:11:55,130
You'd better get down,
and get yourself...

1656
02:11:55,230 --> 02:11:56,806
...some beans and a little sleep.

1657
02:11:56,906 --> 02:11:58,087
No, sir.

1658
02:11:58,187 --> 02:12:00,995
l've gotta get back to the Alamo.

1659
02:12:35,135 --> 02:12:37,597
Yesterday l read you
Fannin's message...

1660
02:12:37,697 --> 02:12:41,695
...telling us he cannot reach
the Alamo in time.

1661
02:12:42,060 --> 02:12:45,499
Today l have this...
from the Alamo.

1662
02:12:47,985 --> 02:12:49,986
They are surrounded...

1663
02:12:50,067 --> 02:12:52,278
...and we can't help them.

1664
02:12:53,509 --> 02:12:55,511
Now, tomorrow,

1665
02:12:55,591 --> 02:12:59,826
when your recruits
start to whine and bellyache,

1666
02:13:02,036 --> 02:13:10,040
you tell them that
185 of their friends,

1667
02:13:10,162 --> 02:13:14,795
neighbours, fellow Texicans,

1668
02:13:14,925 --> 02:13:19,589
are holed up in a crumbling adobe
church down on the Rio Bravo...

1669
02:13:19,689 --> 02:13:22,922
...buying them this precious time.

1670
02:13:30,577 --> 02:13:32,579
l hope they remember.

1671
02:13:34,980 --> 02:13:36,982
l hope Texas remembers.

1672
02:14:19,413 --> 02:14:23,836
lt may not be as comfortable,
but it's safer in here.

1673
02:14:25,257 --> 02:14:27,259
He's had a hard day.

1674
02:14:28,780 --> 02:14:30,360
Will...

1675
02:14:30,460 --> 02:14:32,461
...l'm sorry.

1676
02:14:32,541 --> 02:14:35,010
What for?

1677
02:14:35,142 --> 02:14:38,123
l guess l've said some
pretty rude things to you.

1678
02:14:38,223 --> 02:14:40,773
Well, at least, l thought 'em.

1679
02:14:42,344 --> 02:14:44,324
You're a wonderful woman, Sue.

1680
02:14:44,424 --> 02:14:46,425
Forget it.

1681
02:14:46,505 --> 02:14:49,657
Dick, stay here as long as you can.

1682
02:14:49,786 --> 02:14:52,932
Probably won't need
you till morning.

1683
02:14:54,947 --> 02:14:58,603
l've only added to your
worries, haven't l?

1684
02:14:58,628 --> 02:15:01,348
l know l must be very selfish.

1685
02:15:03,110 --> 02:15:07,191
l couldn't think of facing
the world without you.

1686
02:15:45,322 --> 02:15:47,702
What are you thinkin', Davy?

1687
02:15:50,443 --> 02:15:52,444
l'm not thinkin'.

1688
02:15:53,284 --> 02:15:55,285
l'm just rememberin'.

1689
02:16:00,046 --> 02:16:03,627
Well, l sure done a heap of things
l shouldn't have done.

1690
02:16:03,727 --> 02:16:06,108
Seemed urgent at the moment.

1691
02:16:07,808 --> 02:16:10,989
Got myself a heap of
sins to answer for.

1692
02:16:11,089 --> 02:16:13,090
Wish l hadn't did 'em.

1693
02:16:14,010 --> 02:16:16,482
l reckon old Saint
Pete's gonna slam them

1694
02:16:16,582 --> 02:16:18,991
Pearly Gates right
smack-dab in my face.

1695
02:16:19,091 --> 02:16:21,072
There ain't no Pearly Gates.

1696
02:16:21,172 --> 02:16:25,313
When you're dead, you're meat for
the worms. That's all there is to it.

1697
02:16:25,413 --> 02:16:28,154
You don't believe in no afterlife?
No hereafter?

1698
02:16:28,254 --> 02:16:31,315
Tales for children.
Bunkum and bosh.

1699
02:16:31,735 --> 02:16:34,091
l say this.

1700
02:16:34,216 --> 02:16:36,730
l believe.

1701
02:16:36,856 --> 02:16:39,839
l can never find a
way to argue down...

1702
02:16:39,939 --> 02:16:41,678
...you that don't believe.

1703
02:16:41,778 --> 02:16:44,759
But l believe in the
Lord God Almighty,

1704
02:16:44,859 --> 02:16:47,771
all knowing and all forgiving.

1705
02:16:49,100 --> 02:16:53,241
And l believe that good
shall be triumphant in the end...

1706
02:16:53,341 --> 02:16:56,486
...and that evil
shall be vanquished.

1707
02:16:57,022 --> 02:16:59,173
l believe in a hereafter.

1708
02:16:59,303 --> 02:17:03,284
Me, too. l figure a man's
got to believe in those things,

1709
02:17:03,384 --> 02:17:06,725
does he want to believe in
the good things about man.

1710
02:17:06,825 --> 02:17:10,286
About his very own self.
The real good things.

1711
02:17:10,386 --> 02:17:13,424
Like courage and honesty...

1712
02:17:15,267 --> 02:17:17,827
And love.

1713
02:17:19,428 --> 02:17:21,897
Jethro.

1714
02:17:23,148 --> 02:17:25,150
Yes, sir.

1715
02:17:34,313 --> 02:17:37,629
This is somethin' l
promised Mrs Bowie.

1716
02:17:39,554 --> 02:17:41,535
Know what it is?
- No, sir.

1717
02:17:41,635 --> 02:17:43,635
That's your freedom.

1718
02:17:44,956 --> 02:17:46,995
You're a free man, Jeth.

1719
02:17:48,957 --> 02:17:50,957
Thank you, sir.

1720
02:17:51,477 --> 02:17:54,114
You'd better get your
belongings together...

1721
02:17:54,214 --> 02:17:56,179
...and get on over the wall tonight.

1722
02:17:56,279 --> 02:18:00,530
lt's gonna be more than
a little rough around here.

1723
02:18:05,802 --> 02:18:07,802
Good luck, Jeth.

1724
02:18:07,882 --> 02:18:10,032
Thank you, sir.

1725
02:18:10,163 --> 02:18:13,361
Colonel Bowie,
you say l'm a free man?

1726
02:18:13,484 --> 02:18:15,484
That's right.

1727
02:18:15,564 --> 02:18:18,159
Well, if l'm free,

1728
02:18:18,285 --> 02:18:22,026
then l got a right
to decide what l'm gonna do.

1729
02:18:22,126 --> 02:18:26,207
Seems to me that's what
you men are fighting for.

1730
02:18:26,566 --> 02:18:29,639
So l... reckon l'll...

1731
02:18:30,888 --> 02:18:32,888
...l'll stay.

1732
02:19:22,005 --> 02:19:24,007
Look.

1733
02:21:27,242 --> 02:21:29,597
Gentlemen, good luck.

1734
02:21:30,963 --> 02:21:33,343
Get to your battle stations.

1735
02:22:25,898 --> 02:22:27,899
What's that?

1736
02:22:37,141 --> 02:22:39,142
lt's sure loud.

1737
02:24:31,734 --> 02:24:34,675
Get Bowie out of here.
Get him into the chapel.

1738
02:24:34,775 --> 02:24:36,675
l'm all right.
- Hold still, Colonel.

1739
02:24:36,775 --> 02:24:39,236
l said l'm all right.
- Colonel Crockett says...

1740
02:24:39,336 --> 02:24:41,337
Don't start that again.

1741
02:26:13,738 --> 02:26:16,299
Battery No.3. Come on.

1742
02:26:21,260 --> 02:26:23,695
Get to the infirmary.

1743
02:26:50,588 --> 02:26:52,589
Fire.

1744
02:28:05,009 --> 02:28:07,010
Crockett.

1745
02:28:07,450 --> 02:28:09,451
Crockett.

1746
02:28:13,092 --> 02:28:15,092
North Wall.

1747
02:28:16,493 --> 02:28:18,493
Half of you men.

1748
02:28:18,573 --> 02:28:21,554
Throw up a barricade here.
Throw up a barricade.

1749
02:28:21,654 --> 02:28:23,655
You stay on that wall.

1750
02:29:37,356 --> 02:29:39,336
Do this mean what l think it do?

1751
02:29:39,436 --> 02:29:41,437
lt do.

1752
02:32:31,300 --> 02:32:34,134
Where's Daddy, Mommy?

1753
