1
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,460
Who are you?

2
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,640
What is this?

3
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,310
Your Majesty, caught him up in a fishing net. A fishing net.

4
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,390
Sire, he's been telling stories. Stories that...

5
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,460
We believe he's found a...

6
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,360
Ponce de Leon.

7
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,830
Says he found Ponce de Leon's ship.

8
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,700
- Or sailed on it. - No, I told you,

9
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,140
Ponce de Leon died 200 years ago.

10
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,800
Aye, but he died searching for something, didn't he?

11
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,210
The Fountain of Youth.

12
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,090
How soon can you sail?

13
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,520
With the tide.

14
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,770
Over here! Lucky heather!

15
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,980
Pirate swords! Pirate swords!

16
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,550
Pirate's execution today. Watch him swing!

17
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,550
Pirate puppets!

18
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,210
Take that, you!

19
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,190
Hurry, Papa, or we'll miss the hanging!

20
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,290
It's not a hanging, dear, it's a trial.

21
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,990
The hanging comes this afternoon.

22
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,790
Pirate hanging today!

23
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,630
Come on. Up you get.

24
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,530
Move along, pirate.

25
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,070
Or should I say, "Captain Pirate"?

26
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,440
Come on. Come on! Up you go.

27
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,450
Quiet! Order!

28
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,320
Quiet!

29
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,920
Now appearing before the court,

30
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,290
the notorious and infamous pirate, pillager,

31
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,820
- and highwayman... - Quiet!

32
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,650
...Captain Jack Sparrow!

33
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,430
I told you, the name's Gibbs! Joshamee Gibbs!

34
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,370
- How many times... - Hear ye, hear ye!

35
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,830
Presiding over these trials,

36
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:43,600
all rise and attend, the Right Honorable Justice Smith!

37
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,150
My dear sir.

38
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,120
Quiet!

39
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,690
Now...

40
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,070
...what do we have here?

41
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,530
Jack?

42
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,160
Shut up!

43
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:11,970
I don't recognize him.

44
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,300
Not necessary. You were saying?

45
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,070
Jack Sparrow is not my name.

46
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,150
My name is Joshamee Gibbs.

47
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,010
Is that so?

48
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:25,180
- It says Jack Sparrow here. - I told 'em.

49
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,330
I'm not Jack Sparrow,

50
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,480
who I would be happy to identify to the court

51
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,810
if it would help my case.

52
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,520
I think that would be a poor defense,

53
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,360
unless you want to be bludgeoned again like a harp seal.

54
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,660
The prisoner claims of being innocent

55
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,200
to being Jack Sparrow. How do you find?

56
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,060
No trial? But aren't we here to examine the evidence...

57
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,730
Foreman, your finding. Guilty?

58
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,740
Guilty verdict means he'll hang.

59
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,570
Hang him! String him up!

60
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,370
- Guilty? - That's not fair!

61
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,750
Shut it.

62
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,780
Joshamee Gibbs, the crime of which you've been found guilty of

63
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,690
is being innocent of being Jack Sparrow.

64
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,220
I hereby commute your sentence,

65
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,030
and order that you be imprisoned for the remainder

66
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,030
of your miserable, moribund, mutton-chopped life.

67
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,100
- What?! - Hang him!

68
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,430
- Hang him! - There.

69
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,940
- Balderdash! - String him up! Hang him high!

70
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,240
Means shall be arranged to transport this prisoner

71
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,410
to the Tower of London.

72
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,230
Thanks very much.

73
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,790
Ta.

74
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,230
Come on. Get up there.

75
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,370
Get up!

76
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,710
Hell's teeth. Now we're both headed for prison.

77
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,520
Not to worry. I've paid off the driver.

78
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,060
Ten minutes, we'll be outside London Town, horses waiting.

79
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,720
Tonight, we make the coast.

80
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,190
Then it's just a matter of finding a ship.

81
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,130
- All part of the plan, yes? - Exactly.

82
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,200
I arrived in London Town just this morning

83
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,410
to rescue one Joshamee

84
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,500
Gibbs from one appointment with the gallows.

85
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,440
Seeing as how you're still alive,

86
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,300
I'd say it's all been very successful thus far.

87
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,170
What happened to you, Gibbs?

88
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,870
I thought you were employed elsewhere or otherwise engaged.

89
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,390
Aye. But I always listened

90
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,510
like a thief for news of the Black Pearl.

91
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,120
Nobody's seen where she might next make port.

92
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,310
Then, I hear a rumor:

93
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,950
Jack Sparrow's in London with a ship and looking for a crew.

94
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,820
- Am not. - But that's what I heard.

95
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,190
Fact is, you're signing up men tonight.

96
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,860
Pub called The Captain's Daughter.

97
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,230
- Am not! - Well, I thought it a bit odd,

98
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,100
but then, you've never been the most predictable of sorts.

99
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,240
Tell me something.

100
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,900
There is another Jack Sparrow out there sullying my good name?

101
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,210
- An impostor. - Indeed.

102
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,110
But... an impostor with a ship.

103
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,810
And in need of a crew.

104
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,980
Which, as fate would have it, so am I.

105
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,580
What about you, Jack?

106
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,590
Last I heard, you were hell-bent to find the Fountain of Youth.

107
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,250
Any luck?

108
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,270
Circumstances arose and forced a compelling insight

109
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,410
regarding discretion and valor.

110
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,670
- Meaning, you gave up. - I did not.

111
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,610
I am just as bent as ever. Hellishly so.

112
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,580
I shall taste those waters, Master Gibbs. Mark my words.

113
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,380
Short trip.

114
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,360
All part of the plan, yes?

115
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,560
No.

116
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:34,050
You are Jack Sparrow?

117
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,790
There should be a "Captain" In there somewhere.

118
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,460
I've heard of you.

119
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,660
And you know who I am.

120
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,260
Face is familiar. Have I threatened you before?

121
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,710
You are in the presence of George Augustus,

122
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,170
Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg,

123
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,180
Archtreasurer and Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire,

124
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,710
King of Great Britain and Ireland, and of you.

125
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,550
- Doesn't ring a bell. - I am informed

126
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:04,150
you have come to London to procure a crew for your ship.

127
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,430
Vicious rumor. Not true.

128
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,690
Then you lied to me when you told me you were Jack Sparrow.

129
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,060
I am Jack Sparrow, but I'm not here to procure a crew.

130
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,630
That is... someone else.

131
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,330
Someone else named Jack Sparrow.

132
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,240
You've brought me the wrong wastrel.

133
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,680
Find the proper one and dispose of this impostor.

134
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,870
No, wait, wait, wait. Hang on a minute.

135
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,420
I'm Jack Sparrow, the one and only.

136
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,250
And I am in London.

137
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,450
To procure a crew.

138
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,320
To undertake a voyage

139
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,890
- to the Fountain... - What?

140
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:43,590
Will someone please remove these infernal chains?

141
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,890
Come, come.

142
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,770
We know you're in possession of a map.

143
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,070
So confiscate the map, and to the gallows with him!

144
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,070
Have you a map?

145
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,450
- No. - Where is it?

146
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,280
The truth? I lost it.

147
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,410
- Quite recently, in fact. - I have a report.

148
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,150
The Spanish have located the Fountain of Youth.

149
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:19,430
I will not have some melancholy Spanish monarch,

150
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:24,160
a Catholic, gain eternal life!

151
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,710
You do know the way to the Fountain?

152
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,970
Of course I do. Look at me.

153
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,980
You could guide an expedition.

154
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,640
With your permission, your heinie,

155
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,190
you will be providing, then, a ship...

156
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,450
...and a crew?

157
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,120
And a captain.

158
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,970
Afternoon, sire.

159
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,350
If I may be so bold, why is that man not in chains?

160
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,420
He must be manacled at once.

161
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,150
At the center of my palace? Hardly.

162
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,450
Hector.

163
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,080
How nice to see a fellow pirate make good of himself.

164
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,360
Pirate? Nay. Privateer.

165
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,780
On a sanctioned mission under

166
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,100
the authority and protection of the Crown.

167
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,700
As may be, but first,

168
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,040
what has become of my beloved Pearl?

169
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,310
I lost the Pearl as I lost my leg.

170
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,710
- Lost the Pearl? - Aye.

171
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,790
I defended her mightily enough, but she be sunk nonetheless.

172
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,880
If that ship be sunk properly, you should be sunk with it.

173
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,160
Captain Barbossa, each second we tarry,

174
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,330
the Spanish outdistance us.

175
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,900
I have every confidence you will prevail and be rewarded

176
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,370
with the high station you so desire.

177
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:12,280
- To serve doth suffice, sire. - You, sir, have stooped.

178
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,750
Jack, our sands be all but run.

179
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,220
Where's the harm in joining the winning side?

180
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,150
And you do meet a nicer class of person.

181
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,690
I understand everything.

182
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,390
Except that wig.

183
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,860
He's getting away! Stop him!

184
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,600
- Head him off! - No! Stop that pirate!

185
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,590
Come down!

186
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,280
- He escaped? - Leave it to me, sire.

187
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,120
Guards! Guards!

188
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,380
- Arms at ready! - Aye, sir!

189
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,910
Find him!

190
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,610
Finders keepers!

191
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,970
There!

192
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,770
Is that it?

193
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,440
Halt! Stop that carriage!

194
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,870
Head him off!

195
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,520
Out of the way!

196
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,550
Stop that pirate!

197
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,250
Move out of the way!

198
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,220
Stop that man!

199
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,890
Don't let him get away!

200
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,140
Fire!

201
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,770
He's getting away! After him! Stop him!

202
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,640
After him!

203
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,420
Filthy pirate.

204
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,670
Hello, Jackie.

205
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,860
Hello, Dad.

206
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,480
I heard you're putting together a crew.

207
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,490
If enough people keep saying it, it must be true.

208
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,390
I heard where you're headed. The Fountain.

209
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,020
Have you been there?

210
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,190
Does this face look like it's been to the Fountain of Youth?

211
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,830
- Depends on the light. - Son, the Fountain.

212
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,800
There'll be items required for the profane ritual.

213
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,570
Two chalices.

214
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,740
- On the map there was a chalice. - Two, silver.

215
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,750
From the Ponce de Leon ship. You'll need both.

216
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,510
- For? - The ritual. Don't be a fool, Jackie.

217
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,710
Find out every detail before you set sail.

218
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,720
Oh, set sail. Love to.

219
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,090
But for that, I may need a ship.

220
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,530
Those folk, over there, they have a ship.

221
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,220
They're signing up sailors right now.

222
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,560
My heart is pierced by Cupid

223
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,690
I disdain all glittering gold

224
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,200
And one last thing, Jackie.

225
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,910
The Fountain will test you. Mark my words.

226
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,380
My heart is pierced by Cupid

227
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,450
I disdain all glittering gold

228
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,310
There is nothing can console me

229
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,080
But my jolly sailor bold

230
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,430
I hear you be recruiting a crew.

231
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,630
Aye. That is,

232
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:47,570
Jack Sparrow be putting together a modest venture.

233
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,640
You got some nerve, ain't ya?

234
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,300
Turning up here dressed like that?

235
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,440
What are you, some kind of impostor?

236
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,780
Have you any idea who I am, mate?

237
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,590
Oi, muckers!

238
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,320
There's a bloke here what's forgotten his own name!

239
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,360
Lads, I'm sailing with Sparrow.

240
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,290
Who'll buy a sailor a drink?

241
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,920
Who's next?

242
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,440
Bring us some more of those ones.

243
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,780
Yeah, make it four.

244
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:41,350
You've stolen me, and I'm here to take meself back.

245
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,160
Stop doing that.

246
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,120
Only one person alive knows that move.

247
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,990
Always wanted to do that.

248
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,730
Hello, Angelica.

249
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:10,010
Hello, Jack. Are you impressed?

250
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,340
I think I almost killed you once or twice there.

251
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,540
I'm touched at this most sincerest form of flattery.

252
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,220
But why?

253
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,020
You were the only pirate I thought I would pass for.

254
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,890
That is not a compliment.

255
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,990
Don't worry, Jack. I forgave you a long time ago.

256
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:37,300
- For what? For leaving you? - Recall that I left you.

257
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,340
A gentleman allows a lady to maintain her fictions.

258
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,000
Look, Sparrow. As long as my sailors get their money,

259
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,170
they're willing to put up with any number of peculiarities.

260
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,010
There is one peculiarity with which I will not put up with.

261
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,710
I will be impersonated as "Captain." Nothing less.

262
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,880
Well, for that, you need a ship,

263
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,520
and as it turns out, I have one.

264
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,400
I could use a ship.

265
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:07,260
I hear tell you've been to the Fountain.

266
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,560
There be a lot of hear-telling going on these days.

267
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:14,230
- The Fountain of Youth.  - Dearest Angelica, fret not.

268
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,140
You still have a few usable years left.

269
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,610
Always so charming.

270
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,870
You didn't answer me.

271
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,580
Aye. Regarding the Fountain. Waste of time, really...

272
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,170
Milady, I see unseamanlike

273
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,350
fellows of an officious-looking nature.

274
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,150
Wretched pirates! Find 'em! Maggots!

275
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,520
Friends of yours?

276
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,290
I may have unintentionally slighted some king or other.

277
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,230
Open it!

278
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:44,030
- Yeah, you haven't changed.  - Implying the need?

279
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,540
Yes.

280
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,370
Open this door, in the name of His Majesty.

281
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,870
You betrayed me. You seduced me and you used me.

282
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,740
I was innocent of the ways of men.

283
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,060
You demonstrated a lot of

284
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,180
technique for someone I supposedly corrupted.

285
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,080
Imminent danger. Here, now, milady!

286
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,850
Open it!

287
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,550
I was ready to take my vows. And you...

288
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,320
What were you doing in a Spanish convent, anyway?

289
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,220
Mistook it for a brothel. Honest mistake.

290
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,790
- There he is!  - Over there!

291
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,150
We are at a disadvantage.

292
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,690
Speak for yourself. Unlike some who pretend to be,

293
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,620
but cannot, in fact, hold a candle to,

294
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,230
I am Captain Jack Sparrow.

295
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,990
How can you say I used you?

296
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,330
You know exactly how.

297
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,600
I know, but how can you say it?

298
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,740
- So, what is it?  - What is what?

299
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,410
About the Fountain.

300
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,050
What do you know?

301
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,620
You don't happen to be in possession

302
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,990
of two silver chalices, circa Ponce de Leon?

303
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,560
- No.  - Thought not.

304
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,330
- Why?  - I hear stories.

305
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,300
Rumors.

306
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,570
You are, of course, aware of the ritual.

307
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,630
Yes, I am.

308
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,710
What is it? What is required?

309
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,310
A mermaid, Jack.

310
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,690
There's been a mistake.

311
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:26,360
It's a life sentence, not death. Life!

312
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,100
- Barbossa.  - Thank you, gentlemen.

313
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,230
I trust you can tie a noose.

314
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,780
That's a hard thing,

315
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,910
forcing a man to twist his own hanging rope.

316
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,580
You must lie in your bed the way you made it.

317
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,790
What's happened to you?

318
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,360
- Where be Jack Sparrow?  - He escaped.

319
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,930
I'm on a tight schedule, Gibbs.

320
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,430
The HMS Providence sets sail at first light.

321
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,730
If you do not care to watch it hanging here dead,

322
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,890
with a mouth full of flies...

323
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,160
...speak now.

324
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,400
Take me with you. Any point of the compass...

325
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:14,380
Take you where, Gibbs? The Fountain? Aye?

326
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,510
Is that where Jack be headed?

327
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,710
Have you anything you can offer me, Gibbs?

328
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,380
Anything at all?

329
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,650
Upon me naked word, you'll not see the dawn.

330
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,430
Hand it over.

331
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,470
- You fool!  - I had just enough time

332
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:48,100
to study those infernal circles.

333
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:52,880
Every route, every destination. All safe... in here.

334
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:58,410
Welcome back to His Majesty's navy, Master Gibbs.

335
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
Show a leg, sailor!

336
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,870
Aye, sir.

337
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,710
What?

338
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,040
- There's been a horrible mistake.  - Keep moving.

339
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,520
- I'm not supposed to be here.  - Many a man's woken up at sea,

340
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,590
no idea what, when, wherefore or why.

341
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,980
No memory of the night afore, whence he signed up

342
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,650
and drank away all his bonus money.

343
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,780
No, no, no. You don't understand, mate.

344
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,330
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow. The original. The only.

345
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,020
Scrum, and the pleasure's all mine. Now, keep moving.

346
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,010
Scrum.

347
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,370
Get your elbows in!

348
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,750
Why is there a glass coffin?

349
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,350
Do I look like a man in charge?

350
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,420
- Where am I?   - 'Scuse me, Captain Sparrow, sir.

351
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,220
I be right honored to welcome you aboard

352
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,620
our world-renowned vessel of infamy, Queen Anne's Revenge.

353
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,690
Blackbeard.

354
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,910
Work!

355
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,450
- He's a curious one.  - He's been zombiefied.

356
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,450


357
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,250
Zombiefied.

358
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:43,890
Blackbeard's doing. All the officers are the same.

359
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,760
Makes 'em more compliant.

360
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,000
And perpetually ill-tempered.

361
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,300
- Come on. Scrub.  - Yeah.

362
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:04,010
Pull! Pull! Pull!

363
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,110
Five days underway, at least.

364
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,090
Aye. You can tell that by the smell of the sea?

365
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,960
Smell of the crew.

366
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,630
Oi. What did that poor sod do?

367
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,800
And how can I make sure to not?

368
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,270
Him? Churchly fellow.

369
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,430
Always going on about the Lord Almighty.

370
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,310
Bible-thumper on this ship?

371
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,350
A missionary is his story.

372
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,240
What I heard was he got captured in a raid.

373
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:40,250
Rest of the ship got killed, but not 'im.

374
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,680
First mate wouldn't let it happen

375
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,520
on account of his premier standing with the Lord.

376
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,060
A first mate sticking her neck out for some prisoner.

377
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,820
That you don't see.

378
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,660
"Her"? First mate is a "Her"?

379
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,030
Back to work!

380
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,610
Steady as she goes.

381
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:25,200
You are a ruthless, soulless, cross-grained cur.

382
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,820
- I told you I had a ship.  - No, Blackbeard has a ship,

383
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,770
upon which I am now imprisoned.

384
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,910
We can do this, Jack.

385
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:38,640
The Fountain of Youth, like you always wanted.

386
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:43,880
Blackbeard. Edward Teach. The pirate all pirates fear.

387
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,180
Resurrector of the dead in his spare time.

388
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,190
- He will listen to me.  - He listens to no one.

389
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,220
Maybe to his own daughter?

390
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,700
Daughter as in... beget by?

391
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,400
Long-lost. Recently found.

392
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,370
Who loves her dear papa with all her soul.

393
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,570
- He bought that?  - I sold that.

394
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,810
Then it's the Fountain of Youth for him,

395
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,820
or him and you, not you and me.

396
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,050
No, Jack, that's the best part.

397
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,250
He will be dead.

398
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,960
You'll be handling that part yourself, then?

399
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,360
There is a prophecy.

400
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,690
Maybe you don't believe in the supernatural.

401
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,290
Oh, no, no. I've seen a thing or two.

402
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:42,830
The prophecy is this:

403
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:46,810
Blackbeard will meet his death within a fortnight

404
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:50,400
at the hands of a one-legged man.

405
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,750
That's why he needs the Fountain, Jack.

406
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:11,830
Master Gibbs, short we are a map.

407
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,070
Perhaps you'd be so kind as to provide us an heading.

408
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,940
Be a gem and pour me a gulper.

409
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,520
Nay. We be privateers, not pirates, Master Gibbs.

410
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,780
And in the king's name, we behave as such.

411
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,750
Aye, Captain.

412
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,960
Be we on the proper course, Gibbs?

413
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:40,690
Aye, it be proper. There's your proof.

414
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,500
The Spaniard.

415
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,810
All hands! Battle stations! Get to windward!

416
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:58,010
- All hands, windward!  - Harden up two points!

417
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:01,590
- Two points!  - Cast loose the cannons!

418
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,320
- Gunners, take posts!  - Take position! Gunners ready, sir!

419
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,330
- Out! Thrust!  - Await orders.

420
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,800
Steady!

421
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,730
Guns armed, awaiting orders, sir.

422
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:29,070
Sir. Orders, sir?

423
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,420
He never so much as turned his head.

424
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,420
The Fountain is the prize.

425
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,190
It appears we be not even worth the time it'd take to sink us.

426
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:48,230
And now we've fallen behind. All hands, make more sail!

427
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,930
All hands, more sail!

428
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:54,400
Ride hard between wind and tide!

429
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,980
The topic, gentlemen, is mutiny.

430
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,550
Mutiny most foul.

431
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:14,220
Aye. I signed up to sail under Jack Sparrow, not some pretender.

432
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,620
And a lady, at that.

433
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,960
And mention was failed to be made of this uncanny crew.

434
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,460
Make my toes curl, they do.

435
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,660
I got 'em. All of them.

436
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,770
- Well done.  - Good lad.

437
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,340
On to it, then. Blackbeard.

438
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,940
- What are his habits?  - Stays mostly to his cabin.

439
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,880
That's right, mostly to his cabin.

440
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,210
- Yes, but when he comes out...  - He don't really come out.

441
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,550
He must come out sometime.

442
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,620
Not really, no.

443
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,150
Any of you sail with him before?

444
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,760
- No, no.  - I've never.

445
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:49,920
Definitely not.

446
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,930
- Any of you seen him before?  - Not really, no.

447
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,700
Stays to his cabin, no one sailed with him,

448
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,900
no one's seen him...

449
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:03,040
Good news, gentlemen. This is not Blackbeard's ship.

450
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,010
This is not the Queen Anne's Revenge.

451
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,170
No, this be the Queen Anne's Revenge, right enough.

452
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,780
How do you know?

453
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:12,180
I've seen the name, on the back of the ship.

454
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:20,380
Gentlemen, sirs, fellow conscriptees...

455
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,260
...you have been monstrously deceived.

456
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,530
- We are decepted, then?  - Yes.

457
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,600
You've nay been informed of a destination.

458
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,870
Death lies before us

459
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:38,840
as we sail for the Fountain of Youth.

460
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,340
It would be a sorry plight, mates.

461
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,610
- Death, for certain.  - The garden of darkened souls.

462
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,090
- Untimely our ends will be.  - Unless...

463
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,750
...we take the ship.

464
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,620
We take the ship, then. Now!

465
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:03,360
Go on, then.

466
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,760
- Help me, shipmates!  - Give it to 'em!

467
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,170
- Wake up! It's ours!  - Come on!

468
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,970
Get up! Off your backside!

469
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,880
- Get off your fannies!  - Take it to them, lads!

470
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,850
Help me! Fight!

471
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,800
Jack.

472
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:38,060
If this is a dream, you can keep the sword and boots on.

473
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,730
- If it's not...  - It's a dream.

474
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,410
No, it's not!

475
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,280
I thought I should give you fair warning, we're taking the ship.

476
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,810
Nothing personal.

477
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,790
Think you might be better off if you just...

478
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,760
...stay out of it.

479
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,650
Boggit.

480
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,540
Wretch!

481
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:21,160
You're either with us or against us!

482
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,500
I am not with you, neither am I against you!

483
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,010
Can he do that?

484
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,170
He's religious. I believe it's required.

485
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:36,820
Fight to the bitter end, you cack-handed deck apes!

486
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,030
Take him, men. Tie him down tight!

487
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,510
The ship is ours!

488
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,580
Gentlemen.

489
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,520
I be placed in a bewilderment.

490
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:54,290
There I were, resting,

491
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:59,100
and upon a sudden, I hear an ungodly row on deck.

492
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:04,110
Sailors abandon their posts

493
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,770
without orders, without leave.

494
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,110
Men before the mast,

495
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,650
taking the ship for themselves.

496
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,690
What be that, First Mate?

497
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,690
- Mutiny, Captain.  - Again?

498
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,830
- Mutiny!  - Aye.

499
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,090
Mutiny.

500
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,040
And what fate befalls mutineers?

501
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,700
Now, we know the answer to that, do we not?

502
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:39,440
Mutineers hang!

503
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,990
Captain, I wish to report a mutiny.

504
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,090
I can name fingers and point names.

505
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:35,730
No need, Mr. Sparrow.

506
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:39,100
They are sheep. You, their shepherd.

507
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:46,710
Have I mentioned, sir, what a lovely daughter you have?

508
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:49,780
A fitting last sight for a doomed soul.

509
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:52,350
Remember, Father. We need him.

510
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,970
If I don't kill a man every now and then,

511
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,520
- they forget who I am.  - Coward!

512
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,390
They do not forget.

513
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:02,860
Your crew sees you for the miscreant you are.

514
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,330
A coward, no matter how many you slay.

515
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:07,870
Twice in one day, I find myself in a bewilderment.

516
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,130
You are not bewildered, you are afraid.

517
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,580
You dare not walk the

518
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,130
path of righteousness, the way of the light.

519
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:17,540
No, sir. The truth is it be much simpler than all that.

520
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,580
- I am a bad man.  - That, too.

521
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,700
I might have to kill you too, catechist.

522
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:25,440
- No!  - All Latin blood like her mother.

523
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,680
Father, I beg you.

524
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:31,550
There I be again, forgetting why the missionary is here.

525
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:36,090
My daughter fears for my soul, or what's left of it.

526
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,760
You truly wish to save me, my child?

527
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,830
Every soul can be saved.

528
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,770
Be that true, young cleric?

529
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,600
Yes. Though you I see as a bit of a long shot.

530
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:51,990
Still, I pray for every

531
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:54,570
unfortunate soul on this hell-bound vessel.

532
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,780
You disarm me with your faith.

533
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,620
Eight bells!

534
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,750
Which of you unfortunate souls stood watch?

535
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:10,850
- I did. I stood watch. - Gunner.

536
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,630
You?

537
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,930
Aye.

538
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:22,270
Aye.

539
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:24,400
The cook.

540
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:27,410
Perfect. Lower the longboat!

541
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:34,640
Bring her about!

542
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,440
Why do you do this?

543
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,220
Mutiny. Our laws be clear.

544
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,670
Our laws allow the Captain to show leniency.

545
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,430
I have given this man a chance to determine his fate,

546
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,240
a gift not afforded to all.

547
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:06,820
Oh, you now.

548
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,710
Chance to show the worth of your prayers.

549
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:14,920
Pray he be delivered from... evil?

550
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,600
Course made!

551
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:26,600
Stop. Give that man a chance. Give yourself a...

552
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:54,930
You know when I feel closest to our Maker?

553
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:56,930
When I see suffering, pain and anguish.

554
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:59,590
That's when the true design of this world is revealed.

555
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:03,440
And I see it revealed when in times of hardship and tragedy,

556
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,870
kindness and compassion are shown to those in need.

557
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:08,410
Perhaps you should pray for him to be unharmed, yes?

558
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:10,740
- Please, there's still hope... - Again!

559
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,060
I actually have no interest in the Fountain whatsoever,

560
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,060
so, if your heart is set,

561
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,400
you may drop me off anywhere you like.

562
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,300
That'll be all, Quartermaster.

563
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:38,800
Your words surround you like fog and make you hard to see.

564
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,780
And what of you, the mighty Blackbeard?

565
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,680
Beheaded they say. Still, your body swam

566
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:49,290
three times around your ship, then climbed back onboard.

567
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,020
And here you are, running scared.

568
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:56,090
- Scared. - To the Fountain.

569
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:59,250
The Quartermaster sees things before they happen.

570
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,890
He has foreseen my death, and so the fates have spoken.

571
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,370
The threads of destiny woven.

572
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,470
You have a ridiculously high regard for fate, mate.

573
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:11,240
- And you? - Me?

574
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:15,640
I'm skeptical of predicting any future... which includes me.

575
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,330
It'd be foolish to battle fate,

576
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:21,580
but I'd be tempted to cheat it.

577
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:24,590
I will reach the Fountain. You will lead me.

578
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:31,020
That knife will serve you no better than the mutiny you devised.

579
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,960
Mutiny served me well.

580
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,030
It gained me an audience with you.

581
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,260
Aye.

582
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:41,470
To warn you.

583
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,000
Regarding your first mate,

584
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:47,040
who pretends to be persons she is not.

585
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:48,670
Do tell.

586
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,050
She is not your daughter.

587
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,380
You dare to speak thusly of my flesh and blood?

588
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,050
Sir, the woman is consummate in the art of deception.

589
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,430
I know.

590
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,660
As I mostly unwittingly set her on her wicked path.

591
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,730
Though I cannot claim credit

592
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:13,840
for her existing abundance of natural talent.

593
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,330
Angelica. My beloved daughter,

594
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,070
the one true good thing I have done in this life,

595
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:23,880
and you claim to be the one who corrupted her?

596
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:28,040
Sir, what she is is pure evil.

597
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,590
More to be feared than a wild beast.

598
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,560
Hungry wild beast with gnashing teeth.

599
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:36,720
Vengeful, hungry from hell, beast...

600
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,020
- Father? - Sweetness!

601
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:42,520
No need to hurt him, Father.

602
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:45,900
He will help us. Won't you, Jack?

603
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,770
You see? Even now, she attends to your welfare,

604
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:53,470
giving lie to the claims you make of her.

605
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:05,550
You will lead us to the Fountain. Yes?

606
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,050
Put another way.

607
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:12,260
If I do not make it to the Fountain in time...

608
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,890
neither will you.

609
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,490
I'll have a wee look-see

610
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,170
at those charts straight away then, shall I?

611
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:28,170
Sir.

612
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:33,420
- Aye? - Captain, sir,

613
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:35,950
I am unhappy to report rumors, sir,

614
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:38,280
among the crew, as to our destination.

615
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,450
Shut your trap and make way.

616
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:49,090
- That's the way of it, then. - No disrespect, sir.

617
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,730
What do the men fear? Say it. Speak the words.

618
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:54,800
Whitecap Bay.

619
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:58,070
Aye, Whitecap Bay.

620
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:01,330
And every worthless seaman fears the name,

621
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:02,170
and rightly so,

622
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:04,780
though few know why or dare to ask.

623
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,540
Be the stories true?

624
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,520
Say what robs you of your staunch heart, Gibbs,

625
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:11,820
or forever leave it to the wider fields of fancy.

626
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:16,120
Mermaids, Captain.

627
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,020
Aye. Mermaids.

628
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,330
Sea ghouls, devil fish, dreadful in hunger for flesh of man.

629
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:26,030
Mermaid waters, that be our path.

630
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:27,760
Cling to your soul, Gibbs,

631
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:31,540
as mermaids be given to take the rest...

632
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,110
to the bone.

633
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:37,810
Steady! Steady, men! Find your courage,

634
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,850
or be ready to purpose your fear!

635
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,390
Save yourselves!

636
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,820
- Man overboard! - Nay! A deserter.

637
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,720
- Come about. - Nay!

638
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,830
Gentlemen, I shall not ask any more of any man than what

639
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:56,460
that man can deliver,

640
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:59,460
but I do ask this: Are we not king's men?

641
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:01,040
Aye.

642
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:03,940
- On the king's mission? - Aye.

643
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:05,660
I did not note any fear in

644
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:08,340
the eyes of the Spanish as they passed us by.

645
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,210
- Are we not king's men? - Aye!

646
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:14,280
Aye! Hands all off, and bear away!

647
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:17,390
Stave on ahead to Whitecap Bay!

648
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,390
Bear on, Whitecap Bay!

649
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:36,860
Come.

650
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:38,310
Little drink?

651
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,710
Wine, music, candlelight.

652
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:44,080
I think we've traveled down this road before, Jack.

653
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,050
Yes, we have.

654
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,420
I remember it well.

655
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:55,090
Winding, twisting and turning, gyrating, writhing.

656
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:57,560
Incessant writhing.

657
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,560
Do you recall Saint Dominique?

658
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,560
La Martinique.

659
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,400
I tried to kill you in Saint Dominique.

660
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,300
Either or.

661
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,130
Hardly appropriate for a first mate.

662
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:12,730
Was I the first? I've often wondered.

663
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,110
You can be so charming when you want something, Jack.

664
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,740
The trick is finding out what.

665
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:22,950
The truth, then, is it?

666
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,150
Blackbeard has served his purpose.

667
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:28,620
You and I can go to the Fountain together,

668
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,820
where we shall bathe one another in equal shares of fame

669
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,990
and other assorted debaucheries.

670
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:37,120
And I'll tell you the ritual of the Fountain.

671
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:40,100
Yes. The profane ritual.

672
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:45,000
Can I trust you, Jack?

673
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:49,580
- I need you on my side. - Oh, my dearest Angelica.

674
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,140
You and I are as thick as thieves, love.

675
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,520
Tell me the rules.

676
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:01,320
Water from the Fountain of Youth.

677
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,600
The shimmering tear of a mermaid.

678
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:10,030
The silver chalices of Ponce de Leon.

679
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:13,700
With these items...

680
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,970
- Yes? - With these items,

681
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:19,510
you may take all the years of life from another, Jack.

682
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,610
You know what that means.

683
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,650
We cannot go alone, you and I.

684
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,050
The ritual requires a victim.

685
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:34,660
- That is unfortunate. - Yes, it is.

686
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:38,530
I find my desire for the Fountain greatly lessened.

687
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:42,560
But there is something onboard you do want.

688
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,710
What about Blackbeard?

689
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,440
He's in the chart room. We'll have to be quick.

690
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:05,110
He keeps each ship as a prize.

691
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:11,350
You help me, and I promise you your pick.

692
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,900
Though I think I know the one you will choose.

693
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:23,260
The Black Pearl in a bottle?

694
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:25,140
Why is the Black Pearl in a bottle?

695
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,780
He's even more annoying in miniature.

696
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,950
- Do we have a deal, Jack? - Angelica, I know you.

697
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:40,960
You are not going to steal the life of some innocent man.

698
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:43,820
What about the one-legged man?

699
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:47,730
I need years, Jack.

700
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:52,970
Not for me. For my father.

701
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,910
I am truly the daughter of Blackbeard.

702
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:01,110
You've fallen for your own con, love.

703
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:03,510
No, he is my father.

704
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,380
The lies I told you were not lies.

705
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:10,050
You lied to me by telling me the truth?

706
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,180
- Yes. - That's very good.

707
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,790
- May I use that? - I'm sure you will, anyway.

708
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:17,290
Of course I will.

709
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:20,130
So, will you not give up this quest?

710
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:23,860
I want a father, Jack. I haven't had one.

711
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,400
Angelica, your father, Blackbeard...

712
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,310
he is evil,

713
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,640
and he will kill you given the chance.

714
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,870
- He cannot be saved. - And who are you to set

715
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:39,210
the limits on redemption?

716
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:42,680
You stole years of my life, Jack. You owe me.

717
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:45,880
And you are en route to getting yourself killed,

718
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,360
and I am not inclined to stand by and watch.

719
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:52,220
Whitecap Bay!

720
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,830
All hands on deck! Set to the longboats!

721
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:05,830
Lay'em out flat!

722
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:11,310
No tangles. Make'em look pretty for our dainty guests.

723
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:15,250
We're gonna need light. A lot of light.

724
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,050
Come!

725
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:44,000
Smell that? Whale oil. Stuff burns like a miracle from God.

726
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:48,950
- Can you make it work? - Made by the English.

727
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,210
Let's not get our hopes up.

728
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:03,200
The old moon in the arms of the new one.

729
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:04,560
First of the summer.

730
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:08,700
Perfect for hunting a mermaid's tear.

731
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:24,890
We're doomed. They be drawn to man-made light.

732
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,720
- Sharks? - Worse than sharks, boy.

733
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,380
There'll be mermaids upon us within the hour,

734
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:33,990
you mark my words. And we're the bait.

735
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,070
I heard it said a kiss from a mermaid

736
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:42,300
protects a sailor from drowning.

737
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,310
Don't be a fool! Mermaids are all female, son,

738
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,240
and lovely as a dream of heaven.

739
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:53,650
But when it comes time to churn butter, so to speak,

740
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,780
they snatch a sailor out of a boat

741
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,950
or off the deck of a ship, have their way,

742
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:04,030
and then the sailors are pulled to bottom and drowned and eaten.

743
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:07,920
Or, sometimes, the other way around.

744
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:11,830
- Sing. - What?

745
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,330
They like to hear singing.

746
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,270
My name is Maria

747
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:26,580
A merchant's daughter fair

748
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,310
- Louder. - And I have left my parents

749
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,650
And 3,000 pounds a year

750
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:36,820
My heart is pierced by Cupid

751
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,400
I disdain all glittering gold

752
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:44,020
There is nothing can console me

753
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:47,070
But my jolly sailor bold

754
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:52,800
My heart is pierced by Cupid

755
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:56,640
I disdain all glittering gold

756
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:59,510
There is nothing can console me

757
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:04,150
But my jolly sailor bold

758
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,560
Lord save me.

759
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:30,300
Man, look. Look there.

760
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:32,240
You'll scare her off!

761
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:33,910
Aye, and good riddance!

762
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,590
Can you talk?

763
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,790
Yes.

764
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,800
You're beautiful.

765
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:58,410
- Are you the one who sings? - Aye.

766
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:03,750
Are you my jolly sailor bold?

767
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,210
- Aye, that I be. - Scrum, comport yourself!

768
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:11,540
Boys! There ain't much been given to me

769
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:14,090
in my brief, miserable life, there's the truth in it.

770
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,950
But, by God, I'll have it said

771
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:19,500
that Scrum had himself a kiss from a proper mermaid!

772
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:24,400
My heart is pierced by Cupid

773
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:28,060
I disdain all glittering gold

774
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:31,610
There is nothing can console me

775
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:35,840
But my jolly sailor bold

776
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:40,840
Come all ye pretty fair maids

777
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:45,250
Whoever you may be

778
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:48,950
Who love a jolly sailor bold

779
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:53,830
That ploughs the raging sea

780
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:58,100
My heart is pierced by Cupid

781
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:02,430
I disdain all glittering gold

782
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:06,770
There is nothing can console me

783
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:11,280
But my jolly sailor bold

784
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:16,000
My heart is pierced by Cupid

785
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,950
I disdain all glittering gold

786
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:24,150
There is nothing can console me

787
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:28,130
But my jolly sailor bold

788
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,260
Out upon it! It has begun!

789
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:51,050
Light'em up!

790
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:55,740
Muster your courage! Drive'em to shore!

791
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:09,630
Nets into the water! Quickly!

792
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:02,520
Retreat, all, to land! For your lives!

793
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:07,290
Retreat, I say!

794
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:09,450
Cowards! Back in the water!

795
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:13,790
There be no refuge on land! On my word!

796
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:48,420
come on!

797
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,260
We got one!

798
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:30,900
I'm in love!

799
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,070
Check the wounded!

800
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:38,010
See if you can find one mermaid still alive!

801
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,440
Come, give a hand!

802
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:21,710
Well done, sailor.

803
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:24,320
Did everyone see that?

804
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:26,520
Because I will not be doing it again.

805
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:31,330
Back to the ship. We head for a protected cove. Now.

806
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:51,120
- Lord. Is that? - Mermaid.

807
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:54,780
- Give up this madness now. - I cannot.

808
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:56,680
Ever walk on the beach,

809
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:59,120
look back and see your footsteps in the sand?

810
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:03,250
It's like that, except the footsteps lie before me.

811
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:07,230
- Footstep, actually. - Whitecap Bay, sir.

812
01:10:07,330 --> 01:10:08,960
We must hasten.

813
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:20,640
We travel by foot. Gibbs, I require a heading.

814
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:23,940
- But, sir, the men. - They be dead already.

815
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,180
- They don't sound dead. - Oh, is that so?

816
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:31,660
Well, I hear nothing but seagulls nesting.

817
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:33,850
What is it that you hear, Mr. Groves?

818
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:40,330
Seagulls... nesting.

819
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:43,530
- Nothing more. - Heading, Gibbs?

820
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:53,740
My God.

821
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:55,940
Your head or my heading.

822
01:10:56,050 --> 01:10:58,280
I'll have me one or t'other, I don't care which.

823
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,720
All hands, forward!

824
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:25,670
- It's to you now, Sparrow. - Was that really necessary?

825
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:28,440
Best you not know the exact whereabouts of my ship.

826
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:33,310
- I be a cautious man. - So be I.

827
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,180
What I want first...

828
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:40,790
...is Ponce De Leon's ship.

829
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,730
Why is it we've got to bring her along?

830
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:23,100
Because tears don't keep. We need them fresh.

831
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,970
What is the ritual again?

832
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:28,570
Water from the Fountain and a mermaid's tear?

833
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:30,230
And two silver chalices.

834
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:33,040
One cup with a tear, one without.

835
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:36,720
So, one with a tear and water in both?

836
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,380
Quite complicated, is it not?

837
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:41,580
Both get water. One gets a tear.

838
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,380
The person who drinks the water with the tear

839
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:46,980
gets all the years of life from the other.

840
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:50,260
How many years?

841
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,670
All the years that they have lived,

842
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,330
and they could have lived, if fate had been kinder.

843
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:08,950
Clergyman.

844
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,850
On the off chance that this does not go well for me,

845
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:15,550
I would like it noted here and now

846
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:18,950
that I am fully prepared to believe in whatever I must,

847
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:20,860
so that I may be welcomed into that place

848
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:23,430
where all the goody-goodies get to go. Savvy?

849
01:13:23,530 --> 01:13:27,190
We have a word for that, Jack. You can convert.

850
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:29,830
I was thinking more of an as-needed basis.

851
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:35,100
Quartermaster!

852
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,440
- Aye? - She cannot breathe!

853
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:40,640
- She has water. - She needs air!

854
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:46,520
- Open this. - She will escape.

855
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:50,380
- You're killing her. - I support the missionary's position.

856
01:13:58,900 --> 01:13:59,990
See?

857
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,730
Onward.

858
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:34,390
Just as I thought. Not this way!

859
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:37,900
This is the way, isn't it?

860
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,870
'Course it is, but we should go around to the east.

861
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:42,870
That would take us out of the path of the chalices.

862
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:44,770
- Well, then we'll circle back. - There is no time.

863
01:14:44,910 --> 01:14:46,570
You're the one who insisted on bringing the bloody mermaid.

864
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:48,700
- Well, the mutiny didn't help. - You walk like a girl.

865
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:50,940
- You would know. - Someone must go.

866
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:53,540
You mean split up?

867
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:56,590
You mean jump? This I cannot wait to see.

868
01:14:56,720 --> 01:15:00,720
Sparrow will go. Find the ship, retrieve the chalices.

869
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:02,860
Sparrow? What makes you think he will come back?

870
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:06,230
Yes, what makes you think he will come back?

871
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:08,860
We cannot trust him, Father. I'll go.

872
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:11,430
She'll go.

873
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,810
How much farther to the Fountain?

874
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:18,640
I'm running out of time.

875
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:22,780
About a day's march north, following that river,

876
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:26,410
you'll get to a series of pools. Then you're close.

877
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:30,150
You will go.

878
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:35,360
I was sure it would come to this.

879
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:50,530
You know that feeling you get

880
01:15:50,530 --> 01:15:53,110
sometimes when you're standing in a high place?

881
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:55,180
Sudden urge to jump?

882
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,640
I don't have it.

883
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:01,580
I need those chalices.

884
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:04,180
Shoot. Save me the bother of the fall.

885
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:07,380
You will go. You will return...

886
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:10,690
...or I will kill her.

887
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,020
You won't kill your own daughter.

888
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:17,970
Quartermaster, get me six more pistols,

889
01:16:18,110 --> 01:16:19,700
remove the shot from all but two,

890
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,330
but do not tell me which two.

891
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:27,210
You get to choose, Mr. Sparrow.

892
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:31,180
No.

893
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:34,410
No.

894
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:40,360
- Yes. - You're sure?

895
01:16:40,490 --> 01:16:41,960
'Course I am.

896
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:51,230
Again.

897
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:55,300
Please, they're not even loaded.

898
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:01,510
Again.

899
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:04,250
If you're so keen on killing her,

900
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:06,780
- why don't you just let her jump? - What?

901
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:10,050
If you jump and die,

902
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:13,850
then she will have her chance.

903
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:15,460
Again.

904
01:17:20,730 --> 01:17:24,600
...if I jump, will I survive?

905
01:17:26,910 --> 01:17:28,270
The doll.

906
01:17:44,590 --> 01:17:49,360
- Yes, now you will survive. - This is nonsense! I'm going!

907
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:11,310
Wet. Wet again.

908
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:16,520
We go on. Due north to the Fountain.

909
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,720
Well played, Father.

910
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:22,790
You knew which guns were loaded, right?

911
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,490
Of course, my love.

912
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:39,870
Be nice to have a map about now.

913
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:41,670
Or a ship.

914
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:46,150
Stop! Hold very still.

915
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:51,110
Ye dare not let it touch your skin.

916
01:18:59,830 --> 01:19:03,100
What? What be wrong with an older man having a hobby?

917
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,760
What are you stopping for, eh? Push on!

918
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:08,100
- Push on! - You can sleep when you're dead.

919
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:09,440
Push on!

920
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:14,380
Fortune continues to favor us.

921
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:44,370
The Santiago.

922
01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:47,240
Famously captained by Ponce de Leon.

923
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:51,480
There's no one there.

924
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:52,610
Right, then.

925
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:28,720
We must not stop.

926
01:20:36,730 --> 01:20:38,530
You will walk.

927
01:20:57,650 --> 01:20:59,810
I cannot.

928
01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:01,750
Walk or die.

929
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:09,420
Put your arms around me.

930
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:12,960
- I do not ask for help. - But you need it.

931
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:34,180
- We're in a hurry, yes? - Do not fall behind.

932
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:55,270
Hold here 'til I say!

933
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,190
Such beauty.

934
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:13,660
Surely you're one of God's own creations,

935
01:22:13,790 --> 01:22:16,730
and not a descendant of those dark creatures

936
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:19,160
who found no refuge on the Ark.

937
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:24,060
Such beauty...

938
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:26,970
...and yet deadly.

939
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:31,400
- Deadly? No. - You attacked me.

940
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:36,500
No. You are different.

941
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:38,650
Different?

942
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:42,780
Are you not? You protect.

943
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:47,250
Did you?

944
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:51,690
You pushed me down out of the way.

945
01:22:52,830 --> 01:22:57,330
- You see the Fountain? - No, but we are close.

946
01:22:57,870 --> 01:22:59,740
Bring the creature. Cover its head.

947
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:01,860
She has a name!

948
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:07,900
Pray tell.

949
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:16,020
She is Syrena.

950
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,490
Ponce de Leon.

951
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:05,870
If 40 pirates dreamt 40 nights of treasure,

952
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:09,600
it would not match the contents of this room.

953
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:11,300
You.

954
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,880
- You. - No...

955
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:19,310
-...you. - I was here first.

956
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:23,480
- You, why are you here? - Blackbeard sent me.

957
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:26,110
- Why are you? - Silver chalices

958
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:29,630
- for my royal liege. - Oh, please.

959
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:32,660
Back, back! We have to balance it out!

960
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:37,230
The whole ship will slide!

961
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:42,630
Right, then.

962
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:48,710
What if we each choose an item of approximately equal weight?

963
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:52,820
Put it back!

964
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,380
We touch nothing!

965
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:05,260
What about that?

966
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:07,800
The chalices.

967
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:11,030
Oi! Why do you get to look first?

968
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:12,870
Fine, then.

969
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:33,680
- Together. - Together.

970
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,420
Rocks.

971
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,860
The Spanish.

972
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:42,260
They're ahead of us, mate.

973
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:46,430
I shall have a look at that map. If it's what I fear...

974
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:58,750
I wonder why they left this behind.

975
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:05,520
Don't touch the map.

976
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:11,960
They know the path,

977
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:16,000
but I can also see where they'll most likely make camp.

978
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:30,780
Jack!

979
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:38,120
Gibbs, I was just on me way to break you out of jail.

980
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:41,580
You stole my map.

981
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:44,600
Right. Best be started.

982
01:27:06,550 --> 01:27:08,040
Mermaids.

983
01:27:10,890 --> 01:27:13,830
Careful, these pools run deep.

984
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:17,520
If she escapes, all is lost. Quartermaster.

985
01:27:19,170 --> 01:27:22,460
Look. Look!

986
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:27,010
Staked out to die, to dry in the sun.

987
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:30,740
Only half in the water. Not enough to live,

988
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:35,070
but just enough to make the dying slow.

989
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:37,310
Think on it.

990
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:40,850
Your people, murdered, harvested for their tears.

991
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:45,320
Syrena, won't you cry?

992
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:48,020
All die, even you.

993
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:51,620
- Soon, I hear. - Listen...

994
01:27:53,670 --> 01:27:55,530
Listen.

995
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:59,000
Can you not hear your sisters scream?

996
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:01,570
Do you not hear them?

997
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:05,410
We need but one tear.

998
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:09,580
Vile creature!

999
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:12,310
- Chop off her fingers, one by one! - Choke her!

1000
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:15,050
Cut out the tears from behind the eyes!

1001
01:28:15,190 --> 01:28:16,520
Where's your voice in this?

1002
01:28:17,390 --> 01:28:20,420
Maybe she'll have a change of heart when the sun rises.

1003
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:24,460
Oh, aye, she will burn, but I cannot wait for the sun.

1004
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:26,330
Perhaps we should build a fire.

1005
01:28:26,430 --> 01:28:28,590
- No. - Do not contest me, cleric.

1006
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:31,800
- You will not torture her. - We need only one tear.

1007
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:35,100
I will tear every scale from her body one by one if I see fit.

1008
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:36,800
If that displeases you, go pray.

1009
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:40,070
I was wrong. Not every soul can be saved. Yours cannot.

1010
01:28:40,210 --> 01:28:43,080
Behold, gentlemen, a man formerly of faith.

1011
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:46,120
That vile creature, as you call her, is worth a hundred of you.

1012
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:48,020
Oh, you care for her?

1013
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:52,050
You fancy her.

1014
01:28:53,730 --> 01:28:56,460
And do not deny what is clear to my eyes.

1015
01:28:58,260 --> 01:28:59,390
Question is...

1016
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:04,560
...does she fancy you?

1017
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:10,400
My God, she does. We are in luck!

1018
01:29:11,810 --> 01:29:13,710
Bring forth a tear...

1019
01:29:15,210 --> 01:29:17,740
...or witness the death of this poor soul.

1020
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:23,320
Syrena, if you could manage a tear,

1021
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:25,050
I would be grateful.

1022
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:27,980
Sadness, yes,

1023
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:33,530
- but no sorrow... yet. - Not by your hand, Father!

1024
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:36,330
Time and tide wait for none. Quartermaster.

1025
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:52,140
Aye, mermaids are tough.

1026
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:54,310
The lot of them.

1027
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:58,860
Tie her up like the others. And get rid of this.

1028
01:30:03,430 --> 01:30:06,420
- You are confident? - Yes.

1029
01:30:06,530 --> 01:30:09,520
I am a woman. So is she.

1030
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:20,570
What's your play, Jack? Throwing in with Barbossa.

1031
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:23,440
There is a girl...

1032
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:26,780
...A female... of the opposite sex.

1033
01:30:26,890 --> 01:30:30,850
- When is there not? - Perhaps I should say "Damsel."

1034
01:30:30,990 --> 01:30:34,020
- You're rescuing a damsel? - Well, there's a first.

1035
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:37,390
Yes, but it's just that I may have caused said damsel

1036
01:30:37,530 --> 01:30:41,130
- some manner of harm many moons ago. - Out with it.

1037
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:44,570
Gibbs, this is the woman from Seville.

1038
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:46,430
Ah, you pretended to love her,

1039
01:30:46,430 --> 01:30:48,610
then you left her and broke her heart.

1040
01:30:48,770 --> 01:30:53,470
Worse. I may have had, briefly, mind you...

1041
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:58,810
- ...stirrings. - Stirrings?

1042
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:02,910
- Stirrings. - What? Like feelings, you mean?

1043
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:06,080
No, no, no. Not quite all the way to feelings. More like...

1044
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:11,820
All right, feelings, damn you.

1045
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:16,630
And you left her still. That's low.

1046
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:19,300
Thank you.

1047
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:27,650
Stealth over force.

1048
01:31:27,810 --> 01:31:31,540
I'll take it from here on account of your condition.

1049
01:31:32,690 --> 01:31:34,550
You don't have termites, do you?

1050
01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:36,660
I appreciate your concern, Jack,

1051
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:39,310
but I'll be keeping you company all the same.

1052
01:31:39,490 --> 01:31:42,550
Hold here, Lieutenant Commander. Wait for my signal.

1053
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:16,620
There. That one. That be the leader.

1054
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:19,250
Make note of his tent because that's where...

1055
01:32:20,730 --> 01:32:24,970
No, wait. My God, that must be them right there.

1056
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:30,700
Your sword smells funny.

1057
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:35,780
Aye. Poison from the innards of poisonous toads.

1058
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:39,010
Just a scratch, you're a dead man in minutes.

1059
01:32:39,150 --> 01:32:41,480
Would you mind pointing it the other way?

1060
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:43,380
I don't like toads.

1061
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:51,700
- What are you doing? - Planning an escape route.

1062
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:55,930
- Isn't that how you do it? - Yes.

1063
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:59,160
Or sometimes I just... improvise.

1064
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:27,660
Now what?

1065
01:33:28,530 --> 01:33:31,060
We stroll out, slow and steady.

1066
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,030
Just like we belong.

1067
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:36,730
- I'm sorry, Syrena. - Philip, you're alive.

1068
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:41,070
- Yes. - You came for me.

1069
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:44,430
Why?

1070
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:48,840
You're different, are you not?

1071
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:55,420
Do you know not of kindness? Compassion?

1072
01:35:12,610 --> 01:35:14,600
Tears of sorrow, never.

1073
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:17,170
Mermaids be too tough for that.

1074
01:35:17,310 --> 01:35:19,470
But tears of joy...

1075
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:23,410
They say these be the more potent anyway.

1076
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:26,510
Syrena, on my word, I had no part in this.

1077
01:35:27,790 --> 01:35:29,220
Let her go. You don't need her now.

1078
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:32,320
Let her go? No.

1079
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:35,450
Secure her bonds. We leave her with her own.

1080
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
How's that escape route working?

1081
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:50,110
Here's your chance to improvise.

1082
01:35:50,210 --> 01:35:51,540
I'm attempting it.

1083
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:54,510
I might be able to get a hand loose.

1084
01:35:54,650 --> 01:35:56,910
Oh, you got a knife. That's very good.

1085
01:35:58,020 --> 01:35:59,540
Better.

1086
01:36:04,990 --> 01:36:06,250
I want one of those.

1087
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:15,200
Here's to revenge. Sweet and clear.

1088
01:36:15,330 --> 01:36:19,790
- Revenge? - Come, come, Hector.

1089
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:21,340
If you wanted the chalices,

1090
01:36:21,470 --> 01:36:24,170
you'd seen they were missing and gone.

1091
01:36:24,310 --> 01:36:27,470
You were lying in wait, for Blackbeard.

1092
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:32,680
King George. Privateer. Wig.

1093
01:36:33,820 --> 01:36:35,250
Cheap theatrical facade.

1094
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:38,250
- I'm not buying it. - You weren't there that night.

1095
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:39,990
When the Pearl was lost?

1096
01:36:39,990 --> 01:36:42,220
Taken, not lost.

1097
01:36:44,830 --> 01:36:48,960
We were off the coast of Hispaniola when we came under attack.

1098
01:36:49,130 --> 01:36:52,570
No provocation nor warning nor offer of parley.

1099
01:36:52,710 --> 01:36:55,370
We were peppered with cannon fire.

1100
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:59,740
And then the sea beneath the Pearl began to roil.

1101
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,710
The Pearl was pitching and yawing violently.

1102
01:37:03,850 --> 01:37:05,710
Every plank, every rail,

1103
01:37:05,850 --> 01:37:08,720
every spar, all at once, began to creak.

1104
01:37:08,850 --> 01:37:11,880
The rigging had come to life.

1105
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:14,720
Our own ship turned against us...

1106
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:18,130
...tangling the crew, wrapping around 'em like snakes.

1107
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:20,660
And wrapping around me leg.

1108
01:37:20,830 --> 01:37:23,230
But me arms were free and me sword was to hand.

1109
01:37:23,370 --> 01:37:26,900
I am the master of me ship, not Blackbeard.

1110
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:30,530
I am the master of my fate, not Blackbeard.

1111
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:33,910
So I did what needed done.

1112
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:42,690
I survived.

1113
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:48,450
So... you're not after the Fountain.

1114
01:37:48,590 --> 01:37:52,260
I care not for King George or tavern yarns

1115
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,630
that give hope for a healed limb.

1116
01:37:56,270 --> 01:37:59,930
But I'd give my left arm for a chance at Blackbeard.

1117
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:03,110
- Not your right? - I need me good arm

1118
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:07,910
to drive my poisoned blade through his heart.

1119
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,320
I'll see you get the chance, mate.

1120
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:31,390
The prisoner's escaping.

1121
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:41,370
He's escaping! Fan out! Find him!

1122
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:42,600
Go! Go!

1123
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:47,540
Hold your fire! I want him alive!

1124
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:57,720
I figured that was the signal.

1125
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:44,290
- Go! Prepare to move out! - The enemy is soon upon us.

1126
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:47,310
I'm sorry about the chalices,

1127
01:40:47,310 --> 01:40:48,970
Jack, but I've an appointment to keep.

1128
01:40:49,110 --> 01:40:52,100
- I'll not be going back. - No need.

1129
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:55,270
- Shall we have a drink? - We'll drink at the Fountain.

1130
01:41:13,630 --> 01:41:17,190
How is it we can never meet without you pointing something at me?

1131
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,300
You brought the chalices, Sparrow?

1132
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:23,030
Aye. Oi!

1133
01:41:26,510 --> 01:41:29,640
- I see you brought a friend. - I did.

1134
01:41:29,780 --> 01:41:33,010
And the one-legged man, he is near. Aye?

1135
01:41:33,150 --> 01:41:34,550
Aye.

1136
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:36,380
Now...

1137
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:38,000
Before I go just handing them over,

1138
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,360
I do have one or two conditions.

1139
01:41:39,490 --> 01:41:41,550
- Name them. - Firstly,

1140
01:41:41,690 --> 01:41:44,060
I'll be having me compass back. No, no, that's secondly.

1141
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:46,460
Firstly, upon your word,

1142
01:41:46,570 --> 01:41:48,560
you will bring no harm to Angelica.

1143
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:51,070
I'll make no vows to the likes of you, Sparrow.

1144
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:53,670
But it costs me nothing to admit

1145
01:41:53,810 --> 01:41:56,670
that she was never in harm's way.

1146
01:41:57,310 --> 01:41:59,500
Secondly then, priorly firstly,

1147
01:41:59,650 --> 01:42:01,270
I will be having me compass back.

1148
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:04,210
Please? I do deserve it.

1149
01:42:04,350 --> 01:42:05,620
Do you have any idea how

1150
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:07,840
difficult it was to catch that filthy pig?

1151
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:10,350
Not the big one, the four-legged one.

1152
01:42:13,790 --> 01:42:17,560
Thank you. And thirdly, Mr. Beard,

1153
01:42:17,700 --> 01:42:20,390
there are times, not very often,

1154
01:42:20,530 --> 01:42:23,630
when I do reflect upon my heinous misdeeds.

1155
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:28,070
Chief among them, I note how poorly I have treated Mr. Gibbs,

1156
01:42:28,210 --> 01:42:30,870
- my loyal first mate. - Aye! Now you bring it up...

1157
01:42:31,010 --> 01:42:33,710
Left him to rot in jail, I did. Didn't care.

1158
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:38,510
Still don't. But, point being, you must let him go free.

1159
01:42:40,350 --> 01:42:43,720
- Is that it? - I think so.

1160
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:46,450
Quick, or the pig runs, and good luck getting those chalices.

1161
01:42:46,590 --> 01:42:48,060
Jack, if it's all the same to you, I'd be just as...

1162
01:42:48,190 --> 01:42:49,520
Done.

1163
01:42:49,630 --> 01:42:50,860
Release the swine.

1164
01:42:56,640 --> 01:42:57,950
Perhaps, if you don't mind,

1165
01:42:57,950 --> 01:42:59,900
I could tag along with you folk for a...

1166
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:04,910
This will lead you to freedom, mate.

1167
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:14,450
I could have swore it was somewhere right around here.

1168
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:46,910
We must not stop.

1169
01:45:04,230 --> 01:45:05,660
Dead end.

1170
01:45:06,670 --> 01:45:08,600
Dead. End.

1171
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:10,700
Dead end.

1172
01:45:11,740 --> 01:45:14,710
Jack, I'm starting to think you don't know where you're going.

1173
01:45:15,510 --> 01:45:18,340
It is not the destination so much as the journey, they say.

1174
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:21,010
Chalices, if you please.

1175
01:45:33,020 --> 01:45:34,550
Stand back.

1176
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:58,470
Jack...

1177
01:45:58,620 --> 01:46:00,550
...have you ever, in fact...

1178
01:46:00,690 --> 01:46:06,180
...seen with your own eyes... the Fountain of Youth?

1179
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:08,520
I'm sorry, could you repeat the question, please?

1180
01:46:08,690 --> 01:46:10,160
Quartermaster.

1181
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:12,060
No, no!

1182
01:46:15,730 --> 01:46:17,860
Wait, wait! Wait.

1183
01:46:21,140 --> 01:46:25,600
"Aqua... de Vida."

1184
01:47:04,950 --> 01:47:07,480
Master Scrum...

1185
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:10,490
- ...do you mind? - Squire?

1186
01:48:09,180 --> 01:48:11,170
So beautiful.

1187
01:48:50,660 --> 01:48:53,280
Sparrow, I'll be the first to taste those waters.

1188
01:48:57,760 --> 01:48:59,350
Father.

1189
01:49:02,630 --> 01:49:04,930
The one-legged man.

1190
01:49:07,470 --> 01:49:11,430
- You brought him here. - Would I do that?

1191
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:13,670
Edward Teach!

1192
01:49:13,810 --> 01:49:17,110
For crimes committed on the high seas,

1193
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:21,120
by the authority granted me by His Majesty the King...

1194
01:49:21,250 --> 01:49:24,450
...and with a goodly amount of personal satisfaction...

1195
01:49:24,590 --> 01:49:27,650
...I hereby place you in the custody of the court,

1196
01:49:27,790 --> 01:49:31,130
and declare you to be my prisoner.

1197
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:35,690
My trick's out, is that it?

1198
01:49:35,830 --> 01:49:40,270
Such crimes do include, but are not limited to, piracy, treason,

1199
01:49:40,370 --> 01:49:44,540
murder, torture of the most heinous sort,

1200
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:48,610
including the brutal theft of one used, twisted, hairy right leg.

1201
01:49:49,380 --> 01:49:54,080
You... dare face this sword?

1202
01:49:54,250 --> 01:49:56,690
This far away from your ship? Aye.

1203
01:49:56,820 --> 01:50:01,550
Aye. That be the cold breath of fate I feel down my nape.

1204
01:50:01,690 --> 01:50:07,360
But I'll have one last fight, by God.

1205
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:09,230
Kill 'em all!

1206
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:12,670
Hang on a minute.

1207
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:16,710
I just... I just need to understand something.

1208
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:20,210
Right, so, you will fight against them,

1209
01:50:20,350 --> 01:50:21,680
they will fight against you.

1210
01:50:21,810 --> 01:50:25,510
All on account of him wanting to kill him?

1211
01:50:25,650 --> 01:50:28,010
Where is the sense?

1212
01:50:28,010 --> 01:50:29,590
Exactly.

1213
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:33,450
I say, let them fight each other while we lay back,

1214
01:50:33,630 --> 01:50:37,060
watch, have a drink, place some wagers!

1215
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:39,460
Aye.

1216
01:50:42,030 --> 01:50:43,660
- Kill 'em! - No quarter!

1217
01:51:14,130 --> 01:51:15,790
Get off me!

1218
01:51:48,770 --> 01:51:49,790
Scrum, the chalices!

1219
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:53,060
And the tear! Follow!

1220
01:51:57,080 --> 01:51:58,270
Fight!

1221
01:51:59,180 --> 01:52:02,740
Hand it over. The tear. There's a good lad.

1222
01:52:02,850 --> 01:52:05,180
I'm more afraid of her than I am of you.

1223
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:13,120
Hand it over. There's a good lad.

1224
01:52:16,490 --> 01:52:20,230
- The chalices, if you please. - Sorry, Jack.

1225
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:24,630
I told you, I need years. And now, yours will do.

1226
01:52:32,540 --> 01:52:33,770
Scrum!

1227
01:52:55,430 --> 01:52:56,900
Syrena...

1228
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:03,400
Oh God, you will not take her.

1229
01:53:03,540 --> 01:53:08,500
If you have taken her, you will give her back.

1230
01:53:08,650 --> 01:53:11,010
Give her back...

1231
01:53:11,150 --> 01:53:14,020
Give her back, please. Please.

1232
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:40,370
I expected fate to put up more of a fight, eh?

1233
01:53:57,230 --> 01:54:01,030
I will not have that smile on your face as I strike you down.

1234
01:54:02,430 --> 01:54:05,530
Take a gander, Edward Teach.

1235
01:54:36,070 --> 01:54:39,370
This land is hereby forever claimed in the glorious name

1236
01:54:39,540 --> 01:54:42,100
of His Majesty King George...

1237
01:54:48,350 --> 01:54:51,280
Someone make a note of that man's bravery.

1238
01:54:58,260 --> 01:55:01,990
Senorita, the chalices, por favor.

1239
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:21,510
Only God can grant eternal life,

1240
01:55:21,510 --> 01:55:24,340
not this pagan water.

1241
01:55:35,390 --> 01:55:38,890
Men, destroy this profane temple!

1242
01:55:41,630 --> 01:55:42,960
The Fountain!

1243
01:55:57,020 --> 01:55:58,540
You are a fool.

1244
01:55:58,680 --> 01:56:01,980
You seek in this place what only faith can provide.

1245
01:56:02,090 --> 01:56:04,650
Faith? In faith, there is light enough to see

1246
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:07,020
but darkness enough to blind.

1247
01:56:10,630 --> 01:56:12,890
What devilry is this?

1248
01:56:16,870 --> 01:56:19,460
- For the Pearl. - What have you done?

1249
01:56:23,010 --> 01:56:25,410
Angelica! Don't! It's poison!

1250
01:56:30,050 --> 01:56:32,380
I'm not such the fool to take on Blackbeard

1251
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:35,920
without a little venomous advantage.

1252
01:56:37,220 --> 01:56:38,710
Jack!

1253
01:56:50,540 --> 01:56:52,590
I claim Blackbeard's ship and crew,

1254
01:56:52,740 --> 01:56:56,170
and this sword, payment for my missing limb!

1255
01:57:10,590 --> 01:57:11,990
Hang on! Pull!

1256
01:57:57,270 --> 01:57:59,630
Do not waste my tear.

1257
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:31,230
Drink this. This one has the tear.

1258
01:58:31,370 --> 01:58:33,360
- You must drink the other. - No!

1259
01:58:34,140 --> 01:58:37,370
I cannot save you both. One of you must sacrifice.

1260
01:58:38,310 --> 01:58:41,400
You take it, Father, for your soul.

1261
01:58:43,450 --> 01:58:48,890
Captain Teach, she's dying. You must save your daughter.

1262
01:58:50,050 --> 01:58:52,850
This one takes life?

1263
01:58:52,990 --> 01:58:54,860
This one has the tear and gives life?

1264
01:58:54,990 --> 01:58:56,250
Aye, hurry!

1265
01:59:05,170 --> 01:59:09,440
Angelica... Save me, my child.

1266
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:12,780
No.

1267
01:59:21,490 --> 01:59:22,920
I love you, Father.

1268
01:59:35,900 --> 01:59:37,530
Wait a minute.

1269
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:42,540
In fact, it might have been the other way around.

1270
01:59:43,370 --> 01:59:47,210
This cup had the tear, that one had the other bit.

1271
01:59:47,310 --> 01:59:48,570
Trickster!

1272
01:59:48,710 --> 01:59:50,580
- Devil! - Father!

1273
01:59:57,590 --> 01:59:59,110
You bastard! How could you?

1274
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:01,590
Your father saved you.

1275
02:00:01,730 --> 02:00:04,250
Perhaps his soul is now redeemed, eh?

1276
02:01:05,060 --> 02:01:07,180
You are hurt.

1277
02:01:09,390 --> 02:01:11,330
In body only.

1278
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:17,230
My mind is at peace... because of you.

1279
02:01:18,300 --> 02:01:21,170
- Me? - Yes.

1280
02:01:22,170 --> 02:01:24,570
I was lost.

1281
02:01:25,540 --> 02:01:30,210
The wind, the tides...

1282
02:01:30,350 --> 02:01:33,410
...they ought to renew a man's faith.

1283
02:01:34,990 --> 02:01:36,920
But for me, only you.

1284
02:01:37,820 --> 02:01:41,550
Philip, I can save you.

1285
02:01:41,690 --> 02:01:44,660
You need only ask.

1286
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:50,900
- I seek but one thing. - What is that?

1287
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:54,270
Forgiveness.

1288
02:01:54,410 --> 02:01:57,740
If not for me, you would never have been captured.

1289
02:01:57,880 --> 02:01:59,540
Ask.

1290
02:02:01,410 --> 02:02:03,240
Forgive me?

1291
02:02:28,370 --> 02:02:29,600
I hate you.

1292
02:02:29,740 --> 02:02:32,070
The bloke who saved your life?

1293
02:02:32,210 --> 02:02:35,410
The years I possess, stolen from my own father!

1294
02:02:35,550 --> 02:02:38,570
I only helped Blackbeard do what any father should have done.

1295
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:41,910
You are cruel and ignorant.

1296
02:02:45,620 --> 02:02:49,420
One pistol, one shot.

1297
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:51,790
To kill myself before I starve?

1298
02:02:51,930 --> 02:02:53,490
There's no trusting you, love.

1299
02:02:53,630 --> 02:02:56,100
Besides, this is a well-traveled trade route.

1300
02:02:56,230 --> 02:02:57,830
You can signal a passing ship.

1301
02:02:57,970 --> 02:03:01,430
Or you can just bite the proverbial bullet, as it were.

1302
02:02:57,970 --> 02:03:01,430


1303
02:03:01,570 --> 02:03:03,160
And how will I get free of these bonds?

1304
02:03:03,310 --> 02:03:06,070
You broke free of your bonds half an hour ago,

1305
02:03:06,180 --> 02:03:09,010
waiting for the precise moment to pounce.

1306
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:13,410
Admit it, Jack.

1307
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:17,450
- You still love me. - If you had a sister and a dog,

1308
02:03:17,590 --> 02:03:19,890
I'd choose the dog.

1309
02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:23,420
Treasure! There is a chest with jewels!

1310
02:03:23,530 --> 02:03:25,790
Jewels with the power to rule the wind and tide!

1311
02:03:25,930 --> 02:03:29,020
- You're making that up! - Wait...

1312
02:03:29,830 --> 02:03:33,530
I am with child. Yours.

1313
02:03:34,770 --> 02:03:36,170
I don't recall that we ever had...

1314
02:03:36,310 --> 02:03:39,040
- You were drunk! - I've actually never been that drunk.

1315
02:03:39,180 --> 02:03:40,300
Wait!

1316
02:03:42,180 --> 02:03:44,240
There is something I want to say to you.

1317
02:03:44,420 --> 02:03:48,580
Something I wanted to say from the moment we first met.

1318
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:50,650
Go on, then.

1319
02:03:52,990 --> 02:03:54,320
I love you.

1320
02:03:57,900 --> 02:03:59,730
As do I.

1321
02:03:59,860 --> 02:04:03,320
Always have. Always will.

1322
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:09,330
I gotta go.

1323
02:04:09,470 --> 02:04:10,500
Jack!

1324
02:04:12,810 --> 02:04:14,400
This is not over!

1325
02:04:15,480 --> 02:04:16,540
Jack!

1326
02:04:26,120 --> 02:04:27,610
Missed!

1327
02:04:42,910 --> 02:04:45,930
The Revenge is mine.

1328
02:04:52,620 --> 02:04:54,080
Sir...

1329
02:04:56,550 --> 02:04:58,420
We found this below decks.

1330
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:26,780
All hands! Ply to windward!

1331
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:30,480
Get cracking, ye blooming cockroaches!

1332
02:05:33,190 --> 02:05:35,780
The Crown served me well.

1333
02:05:35,930 --> 02:05:38,920
But now, by the gods of sea and sky...

1334
02:05:39,060 --> 02:05:43,160
...make way for Tortuga!

1335
02:05:54,280 --> 02:05:57,440
Gibbs, you filthy, besotted shellback, you made it!

1336
02:05:57,580 --> 02:05:59,140
Aye!

1337
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:00,880
And I trust we managed a profit

1338
02:06:01,020 --> 02:06:05,180
- from our joint enterprise? - Feast your eyes.

1339
02:06:10,260 --> 02:06:12,790
The compass led me straight and true.

1340
02:06:12,930 --> 02:06:14,920
What of Blackbeard's men guarding the ship?

1341
02:06:15,030 --> 02:06:18,930
I employed the selfsame maneuver we perfected in New Guinea.

1342
02:06:19,040 --> 02:06:23,130
Seemed a shame to leave an entire fleet behind.

1343
02:06:23,270 --> 02:06:25,330
Shame indeed.

1344
02:06:37,290 --> 02:06:38,650
I hate that monkey.

1345
02:06:38,790 --> 02:06:42,230
So, the Pearl... Any idea how to get her out?

1346
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:45,390
We shall need a crossbow, an hourglass, three goats.

1347
02:06:45,530 --> 02:06:46,620
One of us must learn to play

1348
02:06:46,620 --> 02:06:48,560
the trumpet whilst the other one goes like this...

1349
02:06:49,070 --> 02:06:52,370
- I know a man with a goat. - Good. I can go like this.

1350
02:06:55,010 --> 02:06:56,670
Jack, I have to ask...

1351
02:06:56,810 --> 02:06:59,670
You had the chalices, the water, the tear...

1352
02:06:59,810 --> 02:07:02,340
You could have lived maybe forever.

1353
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:04,450
The Fountain does test you, Gibbs.

1354
02:07:04,620 --> 02:07:07,520
But better to not know which moment may be your last.

1355
02:07:07,650 --> 02:07:09,680
Every morsel of your entire being

1356
02:07:09,820 --> 02:07:12,910
alive to the infinite mystery of it all.

1357
02:07:13,060 --> 02:07:15,580
And who's to say I won't live forever, eh?

1358
02:07:15,730 --> 02:07:18,850
Discoverer of the Fountain of Youth.

1359
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,900
I have no say in it, Gibbs.

1360
02:07:22,030 --> 02:07:24,020
It's a pirate's life for me.

1361
02:07:24,970 --> 02:07:26,460
Savvy?
