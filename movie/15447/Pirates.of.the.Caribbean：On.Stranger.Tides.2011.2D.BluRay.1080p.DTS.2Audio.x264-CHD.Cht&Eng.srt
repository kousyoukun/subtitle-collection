4
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,460
你是誰
Who are you?

5
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,640
西班牙  加的斯  [西班牙港口城市]

6
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,640
怎麼回事
What is this?

7
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,310
陛下  我們用漁網撈起了他  漁網
Your Majesty, caught him up in a fishing net. A fishing net.

8
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,390
大人  他有許多故事  那些故事...
Sire, he's been telling stories. Stories that...

9
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,460
我們相信他找到了
We believe he's found a...

10
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,360
龐塞·德萊昂[西班牙探險家]
Ponce de Leon.

11
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,830
他說他找到了龐塞·德萊昂的船
Says he found Ponce de Leon's ship.

12
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,700
-還乘那船出海過  -不  我告訴過你
- Or sailed on it. - No, I told you,

13
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,140
龐塞·德萊昂死了兩百多年了
Ponce de Leon died 200 years ago.

14
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,800
沒錯  可他終其一生在尋找什麼吧
Aye, but he died searching for something, didn't he?

15
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,210
不老泉
The Fountain of Youth.

16
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,090
你何時能啟航
How soon can you sail?

17
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,520
潮起之時
With the tide.

18
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,770
看一看瞧一瞧  幸運草
Over here! Lucky heather!

19
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,010
英國  倫敦

20
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,980
都來買我的海盜佩劍
Pirate swords! Pirate swords!

21
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,550
今日處決海盜  快去看吶
Pirate's execution today. Watch him swing!

22
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,550
海盜玩偶
Pirate puppets!

23
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,210
接招吧  小子
Take that, you!

24
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,190
快點  爸爸  要不就趕不及看絞刑了
Hurry, Papa, or we'll miss the hanging!

25
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,290
那不是絞刑  寶貝  那是審判
It's not a hanging, dear, it's a trial.

26
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,990
下午才行刑呢
The hanging comes this afternoon.

27
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,790
今日處決海盜
Pirate hanging today!

28
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,630
快點  起來
Come on. Up you get.

29
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,530
快走  海盜
Move along, pirate.

30
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,070
是不是該叫你  "海盜船長"
Or should I say, "Captain Pirate"?

31
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,440
快點  快走
Come on. Come on! Up you go.

32
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,450
安靜  肅靜
Quiet! Order!

33
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,320
安靜
Quiet!

34
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,920
傳喚臭名昭著
Now appearing before the court,

35
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,290
聲名狼藉的海盜  劫掠者
the notorious and infamous pirate, pillager,

36
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,820
-匪徒  -安靜
- and highwayman... - Quiet!

37
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,650
傑克·史派羅船長上庭
...Captain Jack Sparrow!

38
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,430
我說過了  我叫吉布斯  約什米·吉布斯
I told you, the name's Gibbs! Joshamee Gibbs!

39
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,370
-我還要說多少...  -注意
- How many times... - Hear ye, hear ye!

40
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,830
全體起立  有請主持本次庭審
Presiding over these trials,

41
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:43,600
尊敬的史密斯法官大人
all rise and attend, the Right Honorable Justice Smith!

42
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,150
大人
My dear sir.

43
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,120
安靜
Quiet!

44
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,690
現在
Now...

45
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,070
是什麼情況
...what do we have here?

46
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,530
傑克
Jack?

47
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,160
閉嘴
Shut up!

48
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:11,970
我不認識他
I don't recognize him.

49
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,300
沒這必要  你剛說什麼
Not necessary. You were saying?

50
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,070
我不是傑克·史派羅
Jack Sparrow is not my name.

51
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,150
我是約什米·吉布斯
My name is Joshamee Gibbs.

52
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,010
是嗎
Is that so?

53
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:25,180
-上面寫著你是傑克·史派羅  -我說過了
- It says Jack Sparrow here. - I told 'em.

54
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,330
我不叫傑克·史派羅
I'm not Jack Sparrow,

55
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,480
但我很樂意向庭上指認他
who I would be happy to identify to the court

56
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,810
要是這能證明我的清白
if it would help my case.

57
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,520
我認為這辯護並不高明
I think that would be a poor defense,

58
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,360
除非你還想像頭蠢海豹一樣被打一下
unless you want to be bludgeoned again like a harp seal.

59
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,660
囚犯辯稱自己不是傑克·史派羅
The prisoner claims of being innocent

60
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,200
你們陪審團以為如何
to being Jack Sparrow. How do you find?

61
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,060
沒有庭審  可我們是來檢驗證據...
No trial? But aren't we here to examine the evidence...

62
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,730
團長  告訴我你的結論  有罪嗎
Foreman, your finding. Guilty?

63
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,740
有罪裁斷將處以絞刑
Guilty verdict means he'll hang.

64
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,570
吊死他  把他吊起來
Hang him! String him up!

65
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,370
-有罪吧  -這不公平
- Guilty? - That's not fair!

66
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,750
閉嘴
Shut it.

67
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,780
約什米·吉布斯  由於你並非傑克·史派羅
Joshamee Gibbs, the crime of which you've been found guilty of

68
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,690
所以你沒有犯下他的罪行
is being innocent of being Jack Sparrow.

69
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,220
因此本庭赦免你的死刑
I hereby commute your sentence,

70
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,030
宣判你將被處以徒刑
and order that you be imprisoned for the remainder

71
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,030
在監獄堳袡L你那行屍走肉般的悲慘餘生
of your miserable, moribund, mutton-chopped life.

72
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,100
-什麼  -吊死他
- What?! - Hang him!

73
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,430
-吊死他  -閉庭
- Hang him! - There.

74
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,940
-胡說八道  -吊死他  把他吊起來
- Balderdash! - String him up! Hang him high!

75
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,240
法庭將安排將囚犯押至
Means shall be arranged to transport this prisoner

76
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,410
倫敦塔
to the Tower of London.

77
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,230
非常感謝
Thanks very much.

78
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,790
拜拜
Ta.

79
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,230
快點  給我上去
Come on. Get up there.

80
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,370
上去
Get up!

81
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,710
真見鬼  這下咱們倆都得進去了
Hell's teeth. Now we're both headed for prison.

82
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,520
別擔心  我買通了車伕
Not to worry. I've paid off the driver.

83
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,060
用不了十分鐘  咱們就出了倫敦城  有馬等著
Ten minutes, we'll be outside London Town, horses waiting.

84
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,720
今晚  我們就能到海邊
Tonight, we make the coast.

85
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,190
再然後就是弄艘船的問題了
Then it's just a matter of finding a ship.

86
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,130
-這都計劃好了嗎  -沒錯
- All part of the plan, yes? - Exactly.

87
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,200
我今早剛到倫敦城
I arrived in London Town just this morning

88
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,410
來救和絞刑架有個約會的
to rescue one Joshamee

89
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,500
名叫約什米·吉布斯的傢伙
Gibbs from one appointment with the gallows.

90
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,440
鑒於你目前還活得好好的
Seeing as how you're still alive,

91
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,300
我認為目前為止還挺成功
I'd say it's all been very successful thus far.

92
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,170
你怎麼了  吉布斯
What happened to you, Gibbs?

93
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,870
我以為你出海了或是在忙別的
I thought you were employed elsewhere or otherwise engaged.

94
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,390
沒錯  可我一直在
Aye. But I always listened

95
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,510
打探黑珍珠號的消息
like a thief for news of the Black Pearl.

96
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,120
誰也不知道她會停靠在何處
Nobody's seen where she might next make port.

97
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,310
後來  我聽到流言
Then, I hear a rumor:

98
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,950
傑克·史派羅在倫敦找了條船  在招募水手
Jack Sparrow's in London with a ship and looking for a crew.

99
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,820
-才怪  -可我是這麼聽說
- Am not. - But that's what I heard.

100
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,190
說你今晚就在
Fact is, you're signing up men tonight.

101
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,860
"船長之女"酒吧招人
Pub called The Captain's Daughter.

102
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,230
-才怪  -我是覺得有點奇怪
- Am not! - Well, I thought it a bit odd,

103
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,100
不過話說回來  你做事總是這麼不靠譜
but then, you've never been the most predictable of sorts.

104
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,240
跟我好好說說
Tell me something.

105
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,900
這兒還有個叫傑克·史派羅的傢伙冒充我的大名
There is another Jack Sparrow out there sullying my good name?

106
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,210
-冒名的騙子  -沒錯
- An impostor. - Indeed.

107
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,110
不過  人家有船
But... an impostor with a ship.

108
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,810
還有水手
And in need of a crew.

109
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,980
這些  蒼天在上  我也會有
Which, as fate would have it, so am I.

110
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,580
你怎麼樣  傑克
What about you, Jack?

111
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,590
我上回聽說  你拼了老命要找那不老泉
Last I heard, you were hell-bent to find the Fountain of Youth.

112
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,250
運氣如何
Any luck?

113
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,270
經歷了千辛萬苦後  我頓悟了
Circumstances arose and forced a compelling insight

114
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,410
此行既需要勇氣  也得小心謹慎
regarding discretion and valor.

115
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,670
-那就是說  你放棄了  -我沒有
- Meaning, you gave up. - I did not.

116
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,610
我還是一樣不要命  妥妥的
I am just as bent as ever. Hellishly so.

117
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,580
我一定要嘗嘗那泉水  吉布斯水手長  我把話撂在這兒
I shall taste those waters, Master Gibbs. Mark my words.

118
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,380
真快
Short trip.

119
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,360
這也是計劃好的吧
All part of the plan, yes?

120
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,560
不是
No.

121
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:34,050
你就是傑克·史派羅嗎
You are Jack Sparrow?

122
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,790
你好像漏了"船長"二字
There should be a "Captain" In there somewhere.

123
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,460
我聽過你
I've heard of you.

124
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,660
你一定知道我是誰
And you know who I am.

125
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,260
看起來挺面熟  我是不是恐嚇過你
Face is familiar. Have I threatened you before?

126
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,710
在你面前的是喬治·奧古斯都
You are in the presence of George Augustus,

127
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,170
伯倫瑞克-呂納堡公爵
Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg,

128
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,180
神聖羅馬帝國的首要財務官和選帝侯
Archtreasurer and Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire,

129
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,710
大不列顛及愛爾蘭的國王  也是你的國王
King of Great Britain and Ireland, and of you.

130
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,550
-還是沒想起來  -我聽說
- Doesn't ring a bell. - I am informed

131
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:04,150
你來倫敦是為了招募水手
you have come to London to procure a crew for your ship.

132
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,430
惡毒的流言  假的
Vicious rumor. Not true.

133
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,690
那你就是在謊稱自己是傑克·史派羅
Then you lied to me when you told me you were Jack Sparrow.

134
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,060
我是傑克·史派羅  不過我來不是為了招水手
I am Jack Sparrow, but I'm not here to procure a crew.

135
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,630
那是...別人
That is... someone else.

136
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,330
別的叫傑克·史派羅的人
Someone else named Jack Sparrow.

137
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,240
你給我找錯了人
You've brought me the wrong wastrel.

138
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,680
給我找來本人  把這個冒牌貨處理掉
Find the proper one and dispose of this impostor.

139
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,870
不  等等  等會兒
No, wait, wait, wait. Hang on a minute.

140
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,420
我是傑克·史派羅  獨一無二的
I'm Jack Sparrow, the one and only.

141
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,250
我就在倫敦
And I am in London.

142
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,450
你要招募水手
To procure a crew.

143
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,320
進行一場偉大的航行
To undertake a voyage

144
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,890
-目標是那什麼泉...  -什麼
- to the Fountain... - What?

145
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:43,590
誰來解開那些見鬼的鎖鏈
Will someone please remove these infernal chains?

146
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,890
來來來
Come, come.

147
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,770
我們知道你有幅地圖
We know you're in possession of a map.

148
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,070
那就沒收那地圖  然後送他上絞架
So confiscate the map, and to the gallows with him!

149
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,070
你有地圖嗎
Have you a map?

150
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,450
-沒  -那在哪兒
- No. - Where is it?

151
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,280
說實話  我弄丟了
The truth? I lost it.

152
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,410
-實際上  就在前不久  -我收到消息
- Quite recently, in fact. - I have a report.

153
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,150
說西班牙人已知道了不老泉的所在
The Spanish have located the Fountain of Youth.

154
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:19,430
我可不能讓可憎的西班牙國王
I will not have some melancholy Spanish monarch,

155
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:24,160
一個天主教徒  獲得永生
a Catholic, gain eternal life!

156
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,710
你當真知道去不老泉的路
You do know the way to the Fountain?

157
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,970
當然  我可是傑克船長
Of course I do. Look at me.

158
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,980
你能領導我們的遠征隊
You could guide an expedition.

159
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,640
如果您允許  大大
With your permission, your heinie,

160
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,190
還提供一艘船
you will be providing, then, a ship...

161
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,450
和水手嗎
...and a crew?

162
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,120
還有船長
And a captain.

163
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,970
午安  陛下
Afternoon, sire.

164
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,350
恕我冒昧  為什麼沒把那傢伙銬起來
If I may be so bold, why is that man not in chains?

165
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,420
必須立即銬上他
He must be manacled at once.

166
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,150
在我這宮殿之中  沒這必要
At the center of my palace? Hardly.

167
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,450
赫克托
Hector.

168
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,080
看到海盜老友從良了真好
How nice to see a fellow pirate make good of himself.

169
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,360
海盜  不  是私掠船長
Pirate? Nay. Privateer.

170
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,780
為捍衛王上的權威
On a sanctioned mission under

171
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,100
而被賦予此項使命
the authority and protection of the Crown.

172
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,700
就算是吧  不過首先
As may be, but first,

173
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,040
我親愛的黑珍珠號哪去了
what has become of my beloved Pearl?

174
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,310
我失去了黑珍珠號  正如我這條腿
I lost the Pearl as I lost my leg.

175
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,710
-失去了什麼意思  -是的
- Lost the Pearl? - Aye.

176
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,790
我曾奮勇守護她  可她終不能免於沉沒
I defended her mightily enough, but she be sunk nonetheless.

177
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,880
船在人在  船亡人亡
If that ship be sunk properly, you should be sunk with it.

178
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,160
巴博薩船長  我們每耽擱一秒鐘
Captain Barbossa, each second we tarry,

179
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,330
西班牙人都會多甩開我們一點
the Spanish outdistance us.

180
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,900
我非常相信  以你的熱忱
I have every confidence you will prevail and be rewarded

181
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,370
你必將無往不勝  贏得我的獎賞
with the high station you so desire.

182
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:12,280
-願盡綿薄之力  陛下  -你也太不要臉了
- To serve doth suffice, sire. - You, sir, have stooped.

183
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,750
傑克  咱倆的日子還長著呢
Jack, our sands be all but run.

184
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,220
識時務  方能成俊傑
Where's the harm in joining the winning side?

185
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,150
而你面前的我確實更有地位了
And you do meet a nicer class of person.

186
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,690
這我都能理解
I understand everything.

187
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,390
除了你那假髮
Except that wig.

188
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,860
他要逃走了  抓住他
He's getting away! Stop him!

189
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,600
-攔住他  -不  攔住那個海盜
- Head him off! - No! Stop that pirate!

190
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,590
下來
Come down!

191
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,280
-他逃走了  -交給我吧  陛下
- He escaped? - Leave it to me, sire.

192
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,120
衛兵  衛兵
Guards! Guards!

193
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,380
-準備好武器  -遵命  大人
- Arms at ready! - Aye, sir!

194
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,910
找到他
Find him!

195
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,610
撿著就是我的
Finders keepers!

196
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,970
在那兒
There!

197
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,770
這就完事了
Is that it?

198
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,440
停下  攔下那輛馬車
Halt! Stop that carriage!

199
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,870
截住他
Head him off!

200
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,520
讓開
Out of the way!

201
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,550
抓住那個海盜
Stop that pirate!

202
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,250
都讓開
Move out of the way!

203
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,220
抓住那個人
Stop that man!

204
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,890
別讓他跑了
Don't let him get away!

205
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,140
開火
Fire!

206
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,770
他跑了  追上他  抓住他
He's getting away! After him! Stop him!

207
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,640
追上他
After him!

208
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,420
下賤的海盜
Filthy pirate.

209
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,670
你好  小傑
Hello, Jackie.

210
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,860
你好  老爸
Hello, Dad.

211
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,480
我聽說你在招募水手
I heard you're putting together a crew.

212
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,490
流言傳了一千遍  也就成了真
If enough people keep saying it, it must be true.

213
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,390
我知道你要去哪  不老泉
I heard where you're headed. The Fountain.

214
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,020
你去過嗎
Have you been there?

215
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,190
你看我這張臉  像是去過不老泉的樣子嗎
Does this face look like it's been to the Fountain of Youth?

216
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,830
-光線問題  -兒子  不老泉
- Depends on the light. - Son, the Fountain.

217
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,800
需要一些特殊道具完成儀式
There'll be items required for the profane ritual.

218
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,570
兩隻聖盃
Two chalices.

219
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,740
-地圖上是有個聖盃  -兩隻  銀製的
- On the map there was a chalice. - Two, silver.

220
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,750
在龐塞·德萊昂的船上  你需要兩隻
From the Ponce de Leon ship. You'll need both.

221
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,510
-為什麼  -完成儀式  別傻了  小傑
- For? - The ritual. Don't be a fool, Jackie.

222
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,710
做好完全的準備  再起航
Find out every detail before you set sail.

223
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,720
啟航  那很好
Oh, set sail. Love to.

224
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,090
可我得有艘船才行
But for that, I may need a ship.

225
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,530
那邊的那些傢伙  他們有船
Those folk, over there, they have a ship.

226
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,220
他們現在就在招水手
They're signing up sailors right now.

227
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,560
我的心被丘比特射中
My heart is pierced by Cupid

228
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,690
我對金子也不屑一顧
I disdain all glittering gold

229
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,200
最後一件事  小傑
And one last thing, Jackie.

230
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,910
不老泉會考驗你  記住我的話
The Fountain will test you. Mark my words.

231
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,380
我的心被丘比特射中
My heart is pierced by Cupid

232
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,450
我對金子也不屑一顧
I disdain all glittering gold

233
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,310
只有快樂勇敢的水手
There is nothing can console me

234
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,080
能讓我的心得到慰藉
But my jolly sailor bold

235
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,430
我聽說你們在招水手
I hear you be recruiting a crew.

236
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,630
是的
Aye. That is,

237
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:47,570
傑克·史派羅正在準備一場探險
Jack Sparrow be putting together a modest venture.

238
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,640
你有點神經兮兮的呀
You got some nerve, ain't ya?

239
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,300
穿成這副模樣
Turning up here dressed like that?

240
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,440
你算哪根蔥  冒名頂替的嗎
What are you, some kind of impostor?

241
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,780
你知道我是誰嗎  朋友
Have you any idea who I am, mate?

242
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,590
喂  哥兒幾個
Oi, muckers!

243
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,320
這兒有個哥們連自己是誰都想不起來
There's a bloke here what's forgotten his own name!

244
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,360
大夥兒  我要和史派羅一起出海了
Lads, I'm sailing with Sparrow.

245
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,290
誰來給水手買杯酒喝
Who'll buy a sailor a drink?

246
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,920
下一位
Who's next?

247
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,440
再來一點
Bring us some more of those ones.

248
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,780
對  再來四個
Yeah, make it four.

249
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:41,350
你偷了我的身份  我來要回我自己
You've stolen me, and I'm here to take meself back.

250
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,160
別學我
Stop doing that.

251
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,120
只有一個人會那招
Only one person alive knows that move.

252
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,990
早就想這麼幹了
Always wanted to do that.

253
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,730
你好  安琪莉卡
Hello, Angelica.

254
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:10,010
你好  傑克  沒想到吧
Hello, Jack. Are you impressed?

255
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,340
我想有那麼一兩次  我差點就能殺了你
I think I almost killed you once or twice there.

256
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,540
你這真摯的讚揚讓我分外感動
I'm touched at this most sincerest form of flattery.

257
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,220
可這是為什麼
But why?

258
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,020
你是唯一一個我能裝得像的海盜
You were the only pirate I thought I would pass for.

259
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,890
這可不是什麼好話
That is not a compliment.

260
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,990
別擔心  傑克  我早就原諒你了
Don't worry, Jack. I forgave you a long time ago.

261
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:37,300
-原諒什麼  我甩了你  -好好想想  是我甩的你
- For what? For leaving you? - Recall that I left you.

262
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,340
紳士總得縱容女士沉溺在她的小幻想中
A gentleman allows a lady to maintain her fictions.

263
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,000
聽著  史派羅  只要我的水手有錢可賺
Look, Sparrow. As long as my sailors get their money,

264
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,170
不管是什麼樣的事情  他們都能湊合
they're willing to put up with any number of peculiarities.

265
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,010
有那麼一件事情  我可湊合不了
There is one peculiarity with which I will not put up with.

266
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,710
我來演船長  必須這樣
I will be impersonated as "Captain." Nothing less.

267
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,880
要想當船長  你得先有艘船
Well, for that, you need a ship,

268
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,520
而我  恰恰就有一艘
and as it turns out, I have one.

269
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,400
我正好需要一艘船
I could use a ship.

270
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:07,260
我聽說你去過那
I hear tell you've been to the Fountain.

271
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,560
最近小道消息真不少
There be a lot of hear-telling going on these days.

272
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:14,230
-不老泉  -親愛的安琪莉卡  別擔心
- The Fountain of Youth.  - Dearest Angelica, fret not.

273
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,140
你還年輕
You still have a few usable years left.

274
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,610
真會講話
Always so charming.

275
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,870
你沒回答我
You didn't answer me.

276
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,580
哦對  至於不老泉  那是浪費時間  真的...
Aye. Regarding the Fountain. Waste of time, really...

277
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,170
夫人  發現一群可疑的人
Milady, I see unseamanlike

278
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,350
不像船員  像是來找茬兒的
fellows of an officious-looking nature.

279
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,150
無恥的海盜  抓住他們  這幫無賴
Wretched pirates! Find 'em! Maggots!

280
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,520
你的朋友嗎
Friends of yours?

281
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,290
我可能不小心惹火了國王之類的人
I may have unintentionally slighted some king or other.

282
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,230
打開
Open it!

283
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:44,030
-你還是沒變  -能給點提示嗎
- Yeah, you haven't changed.  - Implying the need?

284
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,540
那好
Yes.

285
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,370
打開門  這是國王的命令
Open this door, in the name of His Majesty.

286
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,870
你背叛了我  還引誘和利用我
You betrayed me. You seduced me and you used me.

287
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,740
騙術什麼的我本來並不擅長
I was innocent of the ways of men.

288
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,060
就一個我要帶壞的人來說
You demonstrated a lot of

289
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,180
你有點過於強大了
technique for someone I supposedly corrupted.

290
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,080
太危險了  快點  夫人
Imminent danger. Here, now, milady!

291
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,850
打開
Open it!

292
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,550
我正要宣誓  你卻...
I was ready to take my vows. And you...

293
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,320
你究竟怎麼會出現在西班牙的女修道院
What were you doing in a Spanish convent, anyway?

294
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,220
把那當妓院了  純屬失誤
Mistook it for a brothel. Honest mistake.

295
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,790
-他在那  -那邊
- There he is!  - Over there!

296
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,150
我們的處境很被動
We are at a disadvantage.

297
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,690
那是你  我可不像某人裝成別人
Speak for yourself. Unlike some who pretend to be,

298
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,620
實際上連人家一根毛都及不上
but cannot, in fact, hold a candle to,

299
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,230
我才是傑克·史派羅船長
I am Captain Jack Sparrow.

300
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,990
你怎麼能說我利用你
How can you say I used you?

301
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,330
你明明知道
You know exactly how.

302
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,600
我知道  但你怎麼能說出口
I know, but how can you say it?

303
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,740
-那到底是什麼  -什麼是什麼
- So, what is it?  - What is what?

304
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,410
不老泉
About the Fountain.

305
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,050
你知道什麼
What do you know?

306
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,620
龐塞·德萊昂的兩個聖盃
You don't happen to be in possession

307
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,990
不會就剛好在你這吧
of two silver chalices, circa Ponce de Leon?

308
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,560
-沒有  -我想也是
- No.  - Thought not.

309
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,330
-怎麼  -我聽到有些說法
- Why?  - I hear stories.

310
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,300
傳言
Rumors.

311
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,570
你肯定知道儀式吧
You are, of course, aware of the ritual.

312
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,630
是的
Yes, I am.

313
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,710
是什麼樣的  需要什麼道具
What is it? What is required?

314
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,310
一條美人魚  傑克
A mermaid, Jack.

315
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,690
一定是搞錯了
There's been a mistake.

316
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:26,360
我是被判無期徒刑  不是死刑
It's a life sentence, not death. Life!

317
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,100
-巴博薩  -謝謝  先生們
- Barbossa.  - Thank you, gentlemen.

318
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,230
我相信你會繫繩索
I trust you can tie a noose.

319
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,780
這是強人所難
That's a hard thing,

320
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,910
讓人給自己綁絞繩
forcing a man to twist his own hanging rope.

321
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,580
這叫自作自受
You must lie in your bed the way you made it.

322
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,790
你們倆怎麼了
What's happened to you?

323
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,360
-傑克·史派羅呢  -他跑了
- Where be Jack Sparrow?  - He escaped.

324
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,930
我很趕時間  吉布斯
I'm on a tight schedule, Gibbs.

325
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,430
皇家海軍明晨就要出發
The HMS Providence sets sail at first light.

326
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,730
如果你不想死後滿嘴蒼蠅
If you do not care to watch it hanging here dead,

327
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,890
還被掛在這堨亄
with a mouth full of flies...

328
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,160
就趕快招了
...speak now.

329
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,400
帶上我  羅盤上的所有地點...
Take me with you. Any point of the compass...

330
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:14,380
帶你去哪  吉布斯  不老泉嗎
Take you where, Gibbs? The Fountain? Aye?

331
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,510
傑克也要去那兒嗎
Is that where Jack be headed?

332
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,710
你能給我什麼  吉布斯
Have you anything you can offer me, Gibbs?

333
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,380
有嗎
Anything at all?

334
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,650
說白了  你見不到黎明了
Upon me naked word, you'll not see the dawn.

335
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,430
把它給我
Hand it over.

336
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,470
-你個蠢貨  -我有足夠時間
- You fool!  - I had just enough time

337
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:48,100
好好研究了下那張地圖
to study those infernal circles.

338
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:52,880
所有路線和目的地  全都牢牢記在這了
Every route, every destination. All safe... in here.

339
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:58,410
歡迎回到皇家海軍  吉布斯水手長
Welcome back to His Majesty's navy, Master Gibbs.

340
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
起床  水手
Show a leg, sailor!

341
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,870
遵命  長官
Aye, sir.

342
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,710
啥
What?

343
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,040
-這是個天大的誤會  -繼續走
- There's been a horrible mistake.  - Keep moving.

344
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,520
-我不該在這  -許多人在海上醒來
- I'm not supposed to be here.  - Many a man's woken up at sea,

345
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,590
大腦一片空白
no idea what, when, wherefore or why.

346
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,980
完全不記得前天晚上是在哪簽的協議
No memory of the night afore, whence he signed up

347
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,650
又是在哪把佣金全部買了酒喝
and drank away all his bonus money.

348
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,780
不  不  不  你不明白  夥計 
No, no, no. You don't understand, mate.

349
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,330
我是傑克·史派羅船長  如假包換  獨一無二
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow. The original. The only.

350
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,020
我叫史考姆  很高興認識你  好了  走吧
Scrum, and the pleasure's all mine. Now, keep moving.

351
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,010
史考姆
Scrum.

352
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,370
過來
Get your elbows in!

353
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,750
這怎麼有一口玻璃棺材
Why is there a glass coffin?

354
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,350
我看起來像是管事兒的嗎
Do I look like a man in charge?

355
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,420
-這是哪兒  -不好意思  史派羅船長
- Where am I?   - 'Scuse me, Captain Sparrow, sir.

356
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,220
我很榮幸地歡迎您登上這艘
I be right honored to welcome you aboard

357
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,620
臭名昭著的安娜王后復仇號
our world-renowned vessel of infamy, Queen Anne's Revenge.

358
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,690
黑鬍子
Blackbeard.

359
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,910
幹活兒
Work!

360
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,450
-這人挺古怪  -他是還魂屍
- He's a curious one.  - He's been zombiefied.

361
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,450
加勒比海一些部族的宗教信仰  被巫術驅動的死屍

362
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,250
還魂屍
Zombiefied.

363
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:43,890
黑鬍子干的  管事兒的都是
Blackbeard's doing. All the officers are the same.

364
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,760
這樣的人更服從命令
Makes 'em more compliant.

365
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,000
還有沒完沒了的壞脾氣
And perpetually ill-tempered.

366
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,300
-快擦  -好
- Come on. Scrub.  - Yeah.

367
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:04,010
拉  拉  拉
Pull! Pull! Pull!

368
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,110
我們航行了至少五天
Five days underway, at least.

369
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,090
是啊  你是根據海的味道辨別的嗎
Aye. You can tell that by the smell of the sea?

370
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,960
船員的味道
Smell of the crew.

371
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,630
那個可憐鬼做了什麼
Oi. What did that poor sod do?

372
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,800
我怎麼保證不重蹈覆轍
And how can I make sure to not?

373
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,270
他嗎  是個牧師
Him? Churchly fellow.

374
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,430
總是宣揚上帝萬能
Always going on about the Lord Almighty.

375
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,310
船上還有講《聖經》的牧師
Bible-thumper on this ship?

376
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,350
用他的話說是傳教士
A missionary is his story.

377
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,240
我聽說他在一次突襲中被逮住
What I heard was he got captured in a raid.

378
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:40,250
船上其他人都死了  除了他
Rest of the ship got killed, but not 'im.

379
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,680
因為他的虔誠信仰
First mate wouldn't let it happen

380
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,520
大副放過了他
on account of his premier standing with the Lord.

381
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,060
大副她為了這人冒了很大風險
A first mate sticking her neck out for some prisoner.

382
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,820
你能想到嗎
That you don't see.

383
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,660
她?  大副是女的?
"Her"? First mate is a "Her"?

384
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,030
回去幹活兒
Back to work!

385
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,610
船速很穩定
Steady as she goes.

386
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:25,200
你個殘忍  沒良心  遭報應的卑鄙小人
You are a ruthless, soulless, cross-grained cur.

387
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,820
-我跟你說過我有條船  -不對  是黑鬍子的船
- I told you I had a ship.  - No, Blackbeard has a ship,

388
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,770
而我就被囚禁在這條船上
upon which I am now imprisoned.

389
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,910
我們可以聯手  傑克
We can do this, Jack.

390
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:38,640
不老泉  你一直都想去
The Fountain of Youth, like you always wanted.

391
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:43,880
黑鬍子  愛德華·提奇  所有海盜都懼怕的海盜
Blackbeard. Edward Teach. The pirate all pirates fear.

392
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,180
沒事兒喜歡給屍體還魂
Resurrector of the dead in his spare time.

393
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,190
-他會聽我的話  -他不聽任何人
- He will listen to me.  - He listens to no one.

394
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,220
連他女兒也不聽嗎
Maybe to his own daughter?

395
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,700
女兒  親生的嗎
Daughter as in... beget by?

396
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,400
多年失散  最近團聚
Long-lost. Recently found.

397
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,370
她全心全意愛著她的父親
Who loves her dear papa with all her soul.

398
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,570
-他居然信了  -憑我的三寸不爛之舌
- He bought that?  - I sold that.

399
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,810
那麼想去不老泉的是他
Then it's the Fountain of Youth for him,

400
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,820
或者你和他  但不是你和我
or him and you, not you and me.

401
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,050
錯了  傑克  最妙的來了
No, Jack, that's the best part.

402
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,250
他會死
He will be dead.

403
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,960
那你就能獨吞了
You'll be handling that part yourself, then?

404
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,360
有個預言
There is a prophecy.

405
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,690
或許你不相信神奇力量
Maybe you don't believe in the supernatural.

406
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,290
不  不  不  我也見過幾次
Oh, no, no. I've seen a thing or two.

407
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:42,830
預言就是
The prophecy is this:

408
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:46,810
黑鬍子在兩星期內
Blackbeard will meet his death within a fortnight

409
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:50,400
會死於一個獨腿男人手中
at the hands of a one-legged man.

410
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,750
所以他要找不老泉  傑克
That's why he needs the Fountain, Jack.

411
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:11,830
吉布斯水手長  我們少張海圖
Master Gibbs, short we are a map.

412
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,070
或許你該給我們指個方向
Perhaps you'd be so kind as to provide us an heading.

413
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,940
你能行行好  給我來點酒嗎
Be a gem and pour me a gulper.

414
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,520
不  我們不是海盜  這是條私掠船  吉布斯水手長
Nay. We be privateers, not pirates, Master Gibbs.

415
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,780
看在國王的名義上  我們就得這樣
And in the king's name, we behave as such.

416
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,750
是  船長
Aye, Captain.

417
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,960
我們的航線對嗎  吉布斯
Be we on the proper course, Gibbs?

418
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:40,690
沒錯  不信看那邊
Aye, it be proper. There's your proof.

419
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,500
西班牙人
The Spaniard.

420
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,810
全體船員  到戰鬥崗位  到上風向
All hands! Battle stations! Get to windward!

421
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:58,010
-全體船員  上風向  -帆向上拉緊兩個點
- All hands, windward!  - Harden up two points!

422
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:01,590
-兩個點  -解開炮索
- Two points!  - Cast loose the cannons!

423
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,320
-炮手就位  -就位  炮手準備完畢 船長
- Gunners, take posts!  - Take position! Gunners ready, sir!

424
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,330
-準備發射  -待命
- Out! Thrust!  - Await orders.

425
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,800
穩住
Steady!

426
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,730
大炮準備完畢  等待指示  船長
Guns armed, awaiting orders, sir.

427
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:29,070
船長  下命令嗎  船長
Sir. Orders, sir?

428
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,420
他根本沒在意我們
He never so much as turned his head.

429
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,420
不老泉才是目標
The Fountain is the prize.

430
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,190
看來他們不屑於襲擊我們
It appears we be not even worth the time it'd take to sink us.

431
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:48,230
現在我們落後了  全員  快速前進
And now we've fallen behind. All hands, make more sail!

432
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,930
全員  加速前進
All hands, more sail!

433
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:54,400
加速前進  迎著風浪向前
Ride hard between wind and tide!

434
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,980
先生們  我們的話題是  奪權
The topic, gentlemen, is mutiny.

435
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,550
叛亂
Mutiny most foul.

436
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:14,220
沒錯  我是要為傑克·史派羅效力  不是什麼冒牌貨
Aye. I signed up to sail under Jack Sparrow, not some pretender.

437
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,620
更何況還是個女人
And a lady, at that.

438
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,960
還不知道船上都是些可怕的神奇生物
And mention was failed to be made of this uncanny crew.

439
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,460
他們弄彎了我的腳趾
Make my toes curl, they do.

440
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,660
所有的我都弄來了
I got 'em. All of them.

441
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,770
-幹得好  -好小子
- Well done.  - Good lad.

442
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,340
還有一點  黑鬍子
On to it, then. Blackbeard.

443
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,940
-他有什麼習慣  -大多待在他房間
- What are his habits?  - Stays mostly to his cabin.

444
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,880
是的  基本不出來
That's right, mostly to his cabin.

445
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,210
-對  但他一旦出來  -他沒出來過
- Yes, but when he comes out...  - He don't really come out.

446
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,550
他肯定會出來
He must come out sometime.

447
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,620
從沒露面過  沒有
Not really, no.

448
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,150
你們中有誰和他出過海嗎
Any of you sail with him before?

449
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,760
-沒有  沒有  -從來沒有
- No, no.  - I've never.

450
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:49,920
絕對沒有
Definitely not.

451
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,930
-你們有人見過他嗎  -沒有
- Any of you seen him before?  - Not really, no.

452
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,700
他待在房間  沒人和他出過海
Stays to his cabin, no one sailed with him,

453
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,900
沒人見過他
no one's seen him...

454
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:03,040
好消息  先生們  這不是黑鬍子的船
Good news, gentlemen. This is not Blackbeard's ship.

455
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,010
這不是安娜王后復仇號
This is not the Queen Anne's Revenge.

456
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,170
不  這是安娜王后復仇號  千真萬確
No, this be the Queen Anne's Revenge, right enough.

457
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,780
你怎麼知道
How do you know?

458
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:12,180
我見過船尾的船名
I've seen the name, on the back of the ship.

459
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:20,380
先生們  我的難兄難弟們
Gentlemen, sirs, fellow conscriptees...

460
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,260
你們被徹頭徹尾地騙了
...you have been monstrously deceived.

461
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,530
-我們被騙了  -是的
- We are decepted, then?  - Yes.

462
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,600
他們從沒告訴過你們目的地
You've nay been informed of a destination.

463
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,870
死亡正等著我們
Death lies before us

464
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:38,840
因為我們要開往不老泉
as we sail for the Fountain of Youth.

465
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,340
這下我們就慘了  兄弟們
It would be a sorry plight, mates.

466
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,610
-死亡  毫無疑問  -那堿O惡靈的殿堂
- Death, for certain.  - The garden of darkened souls.

467
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,090
-我們活不了多久了  -除非
- Untimely our ends will be.  - Unless...

468
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,750
我們要佔領這條船
...we take the ship.

469
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,620
那就這麼幹吧  就現在
We take the ship, then. Now!

470
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:03,360
去啊
Go on, then.

471
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,760
-來幫忙  水手們  -給他們
- Help me, shipmates!  - Give it to 'em!

472
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,170
-醒醒  船是我們的了  -來吧
- Wake up! It's ours!  - Come on!

473
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,970
起來  起來
Get up! Off your backside!

474
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,880
-別黏糊了  -分給他們  小子
- Get off your fannies!  - Take it to them, lads!

475
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,850
幫我  反抗
Help me! Fight!

476
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,800
傑克
Jack.

477
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:38,060
如果我在做夢  你帶著劍穿著靴子也無妨
If this is a dream, you can keep the sword and boots on.

478
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,730
-如果不是  -你在做夢
- If it's not...  - It's a dream.

479
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,410
不  不是
No, it's not!

480
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,280
我想我該提醒你下  我們要佔領這艘船
I thought I should give you fair warning, we're taking the ship.

481
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,810
不是針對你
Nothing personal.

482
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,790
我覺得這樣對你有好處
Think you might be better off if you just...

483
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,760
如果你能別管這事的話
...stay out of it.

484
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,650
醜八怪
Boggit.

485
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,540
混蛋
Wretch!

486
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:21,160
你是敵是友
You're either with us or against us!

487
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,500
非敵非友
I am not with you, neither am I against you!

488
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,010
這不是自相矛盾嗎
Can he do that?

489
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,170
他信教  信教的人都這樣
He's religious. I believe it's required.

490
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:36,820
受死吧  你們這幫笨頭笨腦的蠢貨
Fight to the bitter end, you cack-handed deck apes!

491
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,030
抓住他  弟兄們  綁緊他
Take him, men. Tie him down tight!

492
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,510
船是我們的了
The ship is ours!

493
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,580
先生們
Gentlemen.

494
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,520
你們讓我很困惑
I be placed in a bewilderment.

495
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:54,290
我正在堶悼薿
There I were, resting,

496
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:59,100
突然聽到甲板上傳來不和諧的吵鬧聲
and upon a sudden, I hear an ungodly row on deck.

497
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:04,110
水手們擅離職守
Sailors abandon their posts

498
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,770
無故缺勤
without orders, without leave.

499
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,110
桅桿前的兄弟
Men before the mast,

500
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,650
想把船據為己有
taking the ship for themselves.

501
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,690
怎麼回事  大副
What be that, First Mate?

502
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,690
-有人叛亂  船長  -什麼
- Mutiny, Captain.  - Again?

503
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,830
-叛亂  -明白了
- Mutiny!  - Aye.

504
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,090
叛亂
Mutiny.

505
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,040
那叛亂者的下場是什麼
And what fate befalls mutineers?

506
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,700
我們知道該怎麼做吧
Now, we know the answer to that, do we not?

507
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:39,440
把叛亂者都吊起來
Mutineers hang!

508
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,990
船長  我想舉報一場叛亂
Captain, I wish to report a mutiny.

509
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,090
我能指名道姓
I can name fingers and point names.

510
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:35,730
不需要  史派羅先生
No need, Mr. Sparrow.

511
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:39,100
他們是羊群  而你  是牧羊人
They are sheep. You, their shepherd.

512
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:46,710
我有說過嗎  船長  你女兒是個美女
Have I mentioned, sir, what a lovely daughter you have?

513
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:49,780
你小子死前還挺有眼福
A fitting last sight for a doomed soul.

514
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:52,350
等等  父親  我們需要他
Remember, Father. We need him.

515
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,970
如果我不時常殺個人
If I don't kill a man every now and then,

516
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,520
-他們會忘了我是誰  -懦夫
- they forget who I am.  - Coward!

517
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,390
他們不會忘
They do not forget.

518
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:02,860
你的船員們把你看做惡魔
Your crew sees you for the miscreant you are.

519
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,330
無論你殺多少人  你都是個懦夫
A coward, no matter how many you slay.

520
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:07,870
一天之中  我兩次感到困惑
Twice in one day, I find myself in a bewilderment.

521
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,130
你不是困惑  你是恐懼
You are not bewildered, you are afraid.

522
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,580
你不敢走正義之路
You dare not walk the

523
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,130
光明之路
path of righteousness, the way of the light.

524
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:17,540
不  牧師  事實比這簡單得多
No, sir. The truth is it be much simpler than all that.

525
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,580
-我就是個壞人  -沒錯
- I am a bad man.  - That, too.

526
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,700
我也能殺了你  傳教士
I might have to kill you too, catechist.

527
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:25,440
-不  -就跟她老媽一個樣
- No!  - All Latin blood like her mother.

528
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,680
父親  我求求你
Father, I beg you.

529
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:31,550
我又忘了這傳教士為什麼還活著了
There I be again, forgetting why the missionary is here.

530
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:36,090
我女兒擔心我的靈魂  或是我剩下的靈魂
My daughter fears for my soul, or what's left of it.

531
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,760
你真想救贖我嗎  孩子
You truly wish to save me, my child?

532
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,830
所有靈魂都能被救贖
Every soul can be saved.

533
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,770
真的嗎  年輕的牧師
Be that true, young cleric?

534
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,600
是的  雖然我覺得你的希望渺茫
Yes. Though you I see as a bit of a long shot.

535
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:51,990
不過  我仍然為
Still, I pray for every

536
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:54,570
這艘地獄之船上所有不幸的靈魂祈禱
unfortunate soul on this hell-bound vessel.

537
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,780
你的信念讓我放下武器
You disarm me with your faith.

538
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,620
八擊鍾
Eight bells!

539
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,750
剛才是哪個倒霉鬼在放哨
Which of you unfortunate souls stood watch?

540
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:10,850
-是我  我在放哨  -炮手
- I did. I stood watch. - Gunner.

541
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,630
你
You?

542
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,930
是的
Aye.

543
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:22,270
是的
Aye.

544
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:24,400
廚子
The cook.

545
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:27,410
非常好  放下大艇
Perfect. Lower the longboat!

546
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:34,640
亮出大炮
Bring her about!

547
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,440
為什麼要這樣  
Why do you do this?

548
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,220
這是叛變  規矩必須遵守
Mutiny. Our laws be clear.

549
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,670
規矩允許船長網開一面
Our laws allow the Captain to show leniency.

550
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,430
我給了他決定自己命運的機會
I have given this man a chance to determine his fate,

551
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,240
這可不是人人都能有的
a gift not afforded to all.

552
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:06,820
喂  你
Oh, you now.

553
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,710
現在來瞧瞧你的祈禱有沒有用
Chance to show the worth of your prayers.

554
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:14,920
祈禱他從魔鬼手中得到...拯救
Pray he be delivered from... evil?

555
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,600
發射
Course made!

556
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:26,600
住手  給他個機會  給你自己...
Stop. Give that man a chance. Give yourself a...

557
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:54,930
知道我什麼時候覺得最接近造物主嗎
You know when I feel closest to our Maker?

558
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:56,930
當我看到苦難  傷痛和苦惱
When I see suffering, pain and anguish.

559
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:59,590
世界的真實面貌就會顯現
That's when the true design of this world is revealed.

560
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:03,440
當苦難和悲劇發生之時
And I see it revealed when in times of hardship and tragedy,

561
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,870
需要的人會得到善意和同情
kindness and compassion are shown to those in need.

562
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:08,410
也許你該祈禱他不受傷害  對吧
Perhaps you should pray for him to be unharmed, yes?

563
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:10,740
-求求你  還有希望  -再來一次
- Please, there's still hope... - Again!

564
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,060
其實我對不老泉沒半點興趣
I actually have no interest in the Fountain whatsoever,

565
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,060
所以  如果你決心已定
so, if your heart is set,

566
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,400
可以隨便把我扔在哪
you may drop me off anywhere you like.

567
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,300
可以了  舵手
That'll be all, Quartermaster.

568
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:38,800
你的花言巧語讓人很難看清你的真面目
Your words surround you like fog and make you hard to see.

569
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,780
那你呢  了不起的黑鬍子
And what of you, the mighty Blackbeard?

570
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,680
他們說你被砍了頭  但是身體
Beheaded they say. Still, your body swam

571
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:49,290
繞船游了三圈  又回到船上
three times around your ship, then climbed back onboard.

572
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,020
而你現在  用恐懼震懾人心
And here you are, running scared.

573
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:56,090
-恐懼  -所以你要去不老泉
- Scared. - To the Fountain.

574
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:59,250
舵手可以預見未來
The Quartermaster sees things before they happen.

575
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,890
他預見了我的死亡  命運已經決定
He has foreseen my death, and so the fates have spoken.

576
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,370
命運之網已經張開
The threads of destiny woven.

577
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,470
你對命運的關注太荒謬了  夥計
You have a ridiculously high regard for fate, mate.

578
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:11,240
-你呢  -我
- And you? - Me?

579
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:15,640
我對所有預言都持懷疑態度  包括我的
I'm skeptical of predicting any future... which includes me.

580
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,330
和命運抗爭是愚蠢的
It'd be foolish to battle fate,

581
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:21,580
不過我想要愚弄它
but I'd be tempted to cheat it.

582
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:24,590
我會到達不老泉  而你會帶我去
I will reach the Fountain. You will lead me.

583
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:31,020
除了叛變  那把刀已經沒更大用處了
That knife will serve you no better than the mutiny you devised.

584
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,960
叛變很成功
Mutiny served me well.

585
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,030
給我贏得了謁見你的機會
It gained me an audience with you.

586
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,260
是的
Aye.

587
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:41,470
來警告你
To warn you.

588
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,000
關於你的大副
Regarding your first mate,

589
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:47,040
她謊報了自己的真實身份
who pretends to be persons she is not.

590
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:48,670
繼續說
Do tell.

591
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,050
她不是你的女兒
She is not your daughter.

592
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,380
你怎麼敢這麼說我的血脈
You dare to speak thusly of my flesh and blood?

593
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,050
先生  這女人精通騙術
Sir, the woman is consummate in the art of deception.

594
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,430
我知道  
I know.

595
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,660
是我不小心將她送上了邪路
As I mostly unwittingly set her on her wicked path.

596
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,730
當然也不能否認
Though I cannot claim credit

597
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:13,840
她極有天分
for her existing abundance of natural talent.

598
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,330
安琪莉卡  我親愛的女兒
Angelica. My beloved daughter,

599
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,070
我這輩子幹的唯一一件好事
the one true good thing I have done in this life,

600
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:23,880
你卻聲稱自己把她毀了
and you claim to be the one who corrupted her?

601
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:28,040
先生  她是純粹的魔鬼
Sir, what she is is pure evil.

602
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,590
比野獸還要可怕
More to be feared than a wild beast.

603
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,560
咬牙切齒的飢餓野獸
Hungry wild beast with gnashing teeth.

604
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:36,720
充滿仇恨  地獄般飢渴  野獸...
Vengeful, hungry from hell, beast...

605
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,020
-父親  -寶貝
- Father? - Sweetness!

606
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:42,520
你不用傷害他  父親
No need to hurt him, Father.

607
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:45,900
他會幫我們  對吧  傑克
He will help us. Won't you, Jack?

608
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,770
你看  即使是現在  她也惦記著你
You see? Even now, she attends to your welfare,

609
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:53,470
即使你在這編造謊言挑撥離間
giving lie to the claims you make of her.

610
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:05,550
你會帶我們去不老泉吧
You will lead us to the Fountain. Yes?

611
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,050
換種說法
Put another way.

612
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:12,260
如果我不能按時到達不老泉
If I do not make it to the Fountain in time...

613
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,890
那你也別想活命
neither will you.

614
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,490
我馬上
I'll have a wee look-see

615
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,170
去看一眼海圖  行嗎
at those charts straight away then, shall I?

616
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:28,170
先生
Sir.

617
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:33,420
-什麼事  -船長
- Aye? - Captain, sir,

618
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:35,950
我很不情願地向您匯報  長官
I am unhappy to report rumors, sir,

619
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:38,280
關於我們的目的地  船員之間有了謠言
among the crew, as to our destination.

620
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,450
閉嘴  走開
Shut your trap and make way.

621
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:49,090
-我叫你走開  -沒有不敬的意思  長官
- That's the way of it, then. - No disrespect, sir.

622
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,730
他們怕什麼  說出來  告訴我
What do the men fear? Say it. Speak the words.

623
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:54,800
白浪灣
Whitecap Bay.

624
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:58,070
好吧  白浪灣
Aye, Whitecap Bay.

625
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:01,330
沒用的水手都害怕這個名字
And every worthless seaman fears the name,

626
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:02,170
自然而然
and rightly so,

627
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:04,780
但沒人知道為什麼  也沒人敢問
though few know why or dare to ask.

628
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,540
傳說是真的嗎
Be the stories true?

629
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,520
說說是什麼讓你這麼心驚膽戰  吉布斯
Say what robs you of your staunch heart, Gibbs,

630
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:11,820
不然的話就別危言聳聽
or forever leave it to the wider fields of fancy.

631
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:16,120
美人魚  船長
Mermaids, Captain.

632
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,020
對  美人魚
Aye. Mermaids.

633
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,330
食屍鬼  魔鬼魚  迫切渴望著人肉
Sea ghouls, devil fish, dreadful in hunger for flesh of man.

634
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:26,030
美人魚的地盤  是我們的必經之路
Mermaid waters, that be our path.

635
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:27,760
堅守你的靈魂  吉布斯
Cling to your soul, Gibbs,

636
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:31,540
因為美人魚會將靈魂以外的東西
as mermaids be given to take the rest...

637
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,110
吃干抹淨
to the bone.

638
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:37,810
穩住  穩住  鼓起勇氣
Steady! Steady, men! Find your courage,

639
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,850
不然就準備屈服於恐懼吧
or be ready to purpose your fear!

640
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,390
快逃命吧
Save yourselves!

641
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,820
-有人落水了  -不  是個逃兵
- Man overboard! - Nay! A deserter.

642
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,720
-改變航向  -不
- Come about. - Nay!

643
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,830
先生們  我不再問任何人
Gentlemen, I shall not ask any more of any man than what

644
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:56,460
他能怎麼樣
that man can deliver,

645
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:59,460
我只想問  難道我們不是國王的子民嗎
but I do ask this: Are we not king's men?

646
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:01,040
是
Aye.

647
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:03,940
-執行國王的任務  -是
- On the king's mission? - Aye.

648
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:05,660
西班牙人經過我們的時候
I did not note any fear in

649
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:08,340
在他們眼堨i沒有任何恐懼
the eyes of the Spanish as they passed us by.

650
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,210
-難道我們不是國王的子民嗎  -是
- Are we not king's men? - Aye!

651
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:14,280
這就對了  堅守崗位  打起精神
Aye! Hands all off, and bear away!

652
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:17,390
一往無前  直奔白浪灣
Stave on ahead to Whitecap Bay!

653
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,390
繼續前進  白浪灣
Bear on, Whitecap Bay!

654
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:36,860
過來
Come.

655
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:38,310
來點酒嗎
Little drink?

656
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,710
美酒  音樂  燭光
Wine, music, candlelight.

657
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:44,080
這場景似曾相識  傑克
I think we've traveled down this road before, Jack.

658
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,050
是的
Yes, we have.

659
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,420
我記得很清楚
I remember it well.

660
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:55,090
搖擺  舞動  旋轉  纏綿
Winding, twisting and turning, gyrating, writhing.

661
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:57,560
無盡的纏綿
Incessant writhing.

662
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,560
還記得聖多米尼克嗎
Do you recall Saint Dominique?

663
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,560
馬提尼克島
La Martinique.

664
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,400
我在聖多米尼克想殺你來著
I tried to kill you in Saint Dominique.

665
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,300
管他呢
Either or.

666
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,130
作為大副這太不合適了
Hardly appropriate for a first mate.

667
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:12,730
我是第一個嗎  我真好奇
Was I the first? I've often wondered.

668
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,110
你有所求的時候總是這麼迷人  傑克
You can be so charming when you want something, Jack.

669
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,740
問題在於發現你想要什麼
The trick is finding out what.

670
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:22,950
真相  對吧
The truth, then, is it?

671
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,150
黑鬍子已經達到目的了
Blackbeard has served his purpose.

672
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:28,620
我們可以一起去不老泉
You and I can go to the Fountain together,

673
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,820
我們可以共同名揚四海
where we shall bathe one another in equal shares of fame

674
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,990
還可以花樣百出  縱情享樂
and other assorted debaucheries.

675
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:37,120
我告訴你怎樣進行不老泉的儀式
And I'll tell you the ritual of the Fountain.

676
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:40,100
對  瀆神儀式
Yes. The profane ritual.

677
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:45,000
我能相信你嗎  傑克
Can I trust you, Jack?

678
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:49,580
-我需要你支持我  -最親愛的安琪莉卡
- I need you on my side. - Oh, my dearest Angelica.

679
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,140
我們現在親密無間  我的愛
You and I are as thick as thieves, love.

680
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,520
告訴我方法
Tell me the rules.

681
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:01,320
不老泉的泉水
Water from the Fountain of Youth.

682
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,600
美人魚閃爍的眼淚
The shimmering tear of a mermaid.

683
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:10,030
龐塞·德萊昂的聖盃
The silver chalices of Ponce de Leon.

684
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:13,700
有了這些東西...
With these items...

685
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,970
-什麼  -有了這些東西
- Yes? - With these items,

686
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:19,510
你就能得到另一個人的所有壽命  傑克
you may take all the years of life from another, Jack.

687
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,610
你知道這意味著什麼
You know what that means.

688
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,650
我們不能自己去  你和我
We cannot go alone, you and I.

689
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,050
儀式需要一個祭品
The ritual requires a victim.

690
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:34,660
-這太不幸了  -確實
- That is unfortunate. - Yes, it is.

691
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:38,530
我發現自己不是很想去不老泉了
I find my desire for the Fountain greatly lessened.

692
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:42,560
不過船上確實有你想要的東西
But there is something onboard you do want.

693
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,710
黑鬍子發現怎麼辦
What about Blackbeard?

694
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,440
他在海圖室  我們得快點
He's in the chart room. We'll have to be quick.

695
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:05,110
他把這些船當作戰利品
He keeps each ship as a prize.

696
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:11,350
你幫我  我就讓你選一艘
You help me, and I promise you your pick.

697
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,900
不過我想我知道你會選哪艘
Though I think I know the one you will choose.

698
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:23,260
黑珍珠號在瓶子
The Black Pearl in a bottle?

699
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:25,140
為什麼黑珍珠號會在瓶子
Why is the Black Pearl in a bottle?

700
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,780
它縮小後更討人厭
He's even more annoying in miniature.

701
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,950
-成交嗎  傑克  -安琪莉卡  我瞭解你
- Do we have a deal, Jack? - Angelica, I know you.

702
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:40,960
你不會向無辜的人竊取生命
You are not going to steal the life of some innocent man.

703
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:43,820
那個獨腿男人怎麼樣
What about the one-legged man?

704
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:47,730
我需要壽命  傑克
I need years, Jack.

705
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:52,970
不是給我  是給我父親
Not for me. For my father.

706
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,910
我真是黑鬍子的女兒
I am truly the daughter of Blackbeard.

707
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:01,110
你騙人騙得分不清現實了  親愛的
You've fallen for your own con, love.

708
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:03,510
不  他確實是我父親
No, he is my father.

709
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,380
我對你說的謊言其實不是謊言
The lies I told you were not lies.

710
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:10,050
你用真相對我撒謊
You lied to me by telling me the truth?

711
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,180
-對  -真不錯
- Yes. - That's very good.

712
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,790
-可以借用嗎  -反正你總會用
- May I use that? - I'm sure you will, anyway.

713
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:17,290
當然了
Of course I will.

714
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:20,130
所以  你不會放棄是吧
So, will you not give up this quest?

715
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:23,860
我想有個父親  傑克  以前從沒有過
I want a father, Jack. I haven't had one.

716
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,400
安琪莉卡  你父親  黑鬍子
Angelica, your father, Blackbeard...

717
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,310
是個魔鬼
he is evil,

718
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,640
一旦有機會他就會殺了你
and he will kill you given the chance.

719
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,870
-他已經沒救了  -你憑什麼
- He cannot be saved. - And who are you to set

720
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:39,210
決定誰能被救贖
the limits on redemption?

721
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:42,680
你偷走了我的年華  傑克  你欠我的
You stole years of my life, Jack. You owe me.

722
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:45,880
你這是要害死自己
And you are en route to getting yourself killed,

723
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,360
我不會就這麼袖手旁觀
and I am not inclined to stand by and watch.

724
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:52,220
白浪灣
Whitecap Bay!

725
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,830
全員集合  放下大艇
All hands on deck! Set to the longboats!

726
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:05,830
把網展平
Lay'em out flat!

727
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:11,310
別弄亂  得為我們的貴賓弄得漂亮點
No tangles. Make'em look pretty for our dainty guests.

728
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:15,250
我們需要光  很亮的光
We're gonna need light. A lot of light.

729
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,050
過來
Come!

730
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:44,000
聞見了嗎  鯨魚油  燒起來像神跡
Smell that? Whale oil. Stuff burns like a miracle from God.

731
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:48,950
-能讓它亮起來嗎  -英國人造的
- Can you make it work? - Made by the English.

732
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,210
別抱太大希望
Let's not get our hopes up.

733
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:03,200
月亮才剛剛露出一牙
The old moon in the arms of the new one.

734
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:04,560
夏季的第一彎新月
First of the summer.

735
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:08,700
獵取美人魚眼淚的完美時機
Perfect for hunting a mermaid's tear.

736
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:24,890
我們完了  她們會被人造光吸引過來
We're doomed. They be drawn to man-made light.

737
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,720
-鯊魚嗎  -比鯊魚還可怕  孩子
- Sharks? - Worse than sharks, boy.

738
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,380
一小時之內美人魚就會到這來
There'll be mermaids upon us within the hour,

739
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:33,990
記住我的話  我們是誘餌
you mark my words. And we're the bait.

740
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,070
聽說美人魚的吻
I heard it said a kiss from a mermaid

741
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:42,300
能保護水手不被淹死
protects a sailor from drowning.

742
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,310
別犯傻了孩子  美人魚全是雌性
Don't be a fool! Mermaids are all female, son,

743
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,240
像夢中的天堂一樣美麗
and lovely as a dream of heaven.

744
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:53,650
但當她們露出本性  據說
But when it comes time to churn butter, so to speak,

745
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,780
她們會把水手拖出船外
they snatch a sailor out of a boat

746
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,950
或者拖下甲板  總之是這樣
or off the deck of a ship, have their way,

747
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:04,030
然後把他們拖到海底  淹死吃掉
and then the sailors are pulled to bottom and drowned and eaten.

748
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:07,920
或者有時候  正好相反
Or, sometimes, the other way around.

749
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:11,830
-唱歌  -什麼
- Sing. - What?

750
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,330
她們喜歡聽人唱歌
They like to hear singing.

751
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,270
我叫瑪莉亞
My name is Maria

752
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:26,580
我是商人的女兒
A merchant's daughter fair

753
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,310
-大點聲  -我離開雙親

754
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,650
每一年賺上三千英鎊
And 3,000 pounds a year

755
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:36,820
我的心被丘比特射中
My heart is pierced by Cupid

756
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,400
我對金子也不屑一顧
I disdain all glittering gold

757
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:44,020
只有快樂勇敢的水手
There is nothing can console me

758
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:47,070
能讓我的心得到慰藉
But my jolly sailor bold

759
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:52,800
我的心被丘比特射中
My heart is pierced by Cupid

760
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:56,640
我對金子也不屑一顧
I disdain all glittering gold

761
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:59,510
只有快樂勇敢的水手
There is nothing can console me

762
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:04,150
能讓我的心得到慰藉
But my jolly sailor bold

763
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,560
神啊  救救我吧
Lord save me.

764
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:30,300
看  看那邊
Man, look. Look there.

765
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:32,240
你會嚇到她
You'll scare her off!

766
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:33,910
那可真是謝天謝地
Aye, and good riddance!

767
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,590
你會說話嗎
Can you talk?

768
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,790
會
Yes.

769

771
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:03,750
你是我快樂勇敢的水手嗎

772
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,210
-是  我是  -史考姆  清醒點
- Aye, that I be. - Scrum, comport yourself!

773
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:11,540
大伙們  我短暫而悲慘的一生中
Boys! There ain't much been given to me

774
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:14,090
從來沒得到過什麼  真的
in my brief, miserable life, there's the truth in it.

775
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,950
但是  天哪  我現在得說
But, by God, I'll have it said

776
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:19,500
史考姆要得到一個真正的美人魚之吻了
that Scrum had himself a kiss from a proper mermaid!

777
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:24,400
我的心被丘比特射中

我的心被丘比特射中
My heart is pierced by Cupid

790

我對金子也不屑一顧

只有快樂勇敢的水手
There is nothing can console me

792

能讓我的心得到慰藉
But my jolly sailor bold

793
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,260
都出來  開始了
Out upon it! It has begun!

794
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:51,050
點起來
Light'em up!

795
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:55,740
鼓起勇氣  把她們趕到岸邊
Muster your courage! Drive'em to shore!

796
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:09,630
把網撒進水  快
Nets into the water! Quickly!

797
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:02,520
撤退  所有人上岸  保命要緊
Retreat, all, to land! For your lives!

798
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:07,290
快撤退
Retreat, I say!

799
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:09,450
膽小鬼  回水堨h
Cowards! Back in the water!

800
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:13,790
岸上沒地方給你們躲  我說到做到
There be no refuge on land! On my word!

801
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:48,420
來
come on!

我們抓到一個
We got one!

I'm in love!

804
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,070
查看傷員
Check the wounded!

805
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:38,010
看能不能找到還活著的美人魚
See if you can find one mermaid still alive!

806
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,440
快來  搭把手
Come, give a hand!

807
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:21,710
幹得漂亮  水手
Well done, sailor.

808
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:24,320
大家都看見了嗎
Did everyone see that?

809
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:26,520
下次我絕對不這麼玩了
Because I will not be doing it again.

810
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:31,330
回船  駛向安全地帶  快點
Back to the ship. We head for a protected cove. Now.

811
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:51,120
-老天  這難道是...  -美人魚
- Lord. Is that? - Mermaid.

812
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:54,780
-放棄這瘋狂任務吧  -不行
- Give up this madness now. - I cannot.

813
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:56,680
你走在沙灘上的時候
Ever walk on the beach,

814
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:59,120
會不會回頭看自己留下的腳印們
look back and see your footsteps in the sand?

815
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:03,250
就是這感覺  不過我的腳印們朝向前方
It's like that, except the footsteps lie before me.

816
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:07,230
-是腳印  沒有"們"  -白浪灣  長官
- Footstep, actually. - Whitecap Bay, sir.

817
01:10:07,330 --> 01:10:08,960
我們必須加快步伐
We must hasten.

818
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:20,640
咱們用走的  吉布斯  需要有人帶路
We travel by foot. Gibbs, I require a heading.

819
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:23,940
-但是長官  我們的船員...  -他們已經死了
- But, sir, the men. - They be dead already.

820
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,180
-聽起來還沒死  -真的嗎
- They don't sound dead. - Oh, is that so?

821
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:31,660
我只聽到海鷗築巢的聲音而已
Well, I hear nothing but seagulls nesting.

822
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:33,850
你聽見什麼聲音了  格洛夫斯先生  
What is it that you hear, Mr. Groves?

823
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:40,330
海鷗...在築巢
Seagulls... nesting.

824
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:43,530
-沒有別的了  -領路  吉布斯
- Nothing more. - Heading, Gibbs?

825
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:53,740
老天
My God.

826
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:55,940
你不領頭  我就領走你的頭
Your head or my heading.

827
01:10:56,050 --> 01:10:58,280
任選其一  我無所謂
I'll have me one or t'other, I don't care which.

828
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,720
全體前進
All hands, forward!

829
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:25,670
-該你上場了  史派羅  -這樣真有必要嗎
- It's to you now, Sparrow. - Was that really necessary?

830
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:28,440
你最好不要知道我的船的下落
Best you not know the exact whereabouts of my ship.

831
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:33,310
-我可是個謹慎的人  -我也是
- I be a cautious man. - So be I.

832
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,180
但我最想知道的是
What I want first...

833
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:40,790
龐塞·德萊昂的船在哪
...is Ponce De Leon's ship.

834
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,730
我們為什麼要帶她一起走
Why is it we've got to bring her along?

835
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:23,100
我們需要新鮮的眼淚
Because tears don't keep. We need them fresh.

836
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,970
這什麼儀式來著
What is the ritual again?

837
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:28,570
泉中水和人魚淚
Water from the Fountain and a mermaid's tear?

838
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:30,230
還有兩隻銀聖盃
And two silver chalices.

839
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:33,040
一杯有眼淚  一杯沒有
One cup with a tear, one without.

840
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:36,720
就是兩杯都有水  一杯埵陴\
So, one with a tear and water in both?

841
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,380
還真夠麻煩的  是吧
Quite complicated, is it not?

842
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:41,580
兩杯都有水  其中一杯有眼淚 
Both get water. One gets a tear.

843
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,380
喝那杯帶眼淚的人
The person who drinks the water with the tear

844
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:46,980
能獲得喝另一杯的人的所有壽命
gets all the years of life from the other.

845
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:50,260
那是多少年
How many years?

846
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,670
所有已生之年
All the years that they have lived,

847
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,330
和剩下的未活之年  如果命運發慈悲的話
and they could have lived, if fate had been kinder.

848
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:08,950
牧師
Clergyman.

849
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,850
萬一萬一我遭遇啥不測
On the off chance that this does not go well for me,

850
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:15,550
我想跟你說
I would like it noted here and now

851
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:18,950
我願意相信你那些有的沒的
that I am fully prepared to believe in whatever I must,

852
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:20,860
讓我也能進那個好地方
so that I may be welcomed into that place

853
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:23,430
就是那些虛偽的老好人去的地方  懂?
where all the goody-goodies get to go. Savvy?

854
01:13:23,530 --> 01:13:27,190
我們有個術語  傑克  你可以皈依
We have a word for that, Jack. You can convert.

855
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:29,830
我是想等到萬不得已再說
I was thinking more of an as-needed basis.

856
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:35,100
舵手
Quartermaster!

857
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,440
-怎麼  -她不能呼吸了
- Aye? - She cannot breathe!

858
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:40,640
-箱埵酗  -她需要空氣
- She has water. - She needs air!

859
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:46,520
-把蓋子打開  -她會逃走
- Open this. - She will escape.

860
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:50,380
-你會殺了她  -我支持傳教士
- You're killing her. - I support the missionary's position.

861
01:13:58,900 --> 01:13:59,990
看見了嗎
See?

862
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,730
繼續前進
Onward.

863
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:34,390
和我想的一樣  此路不通
Just as I thought. Not this way!

864
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:37,900
應該朝這邊走  不是嗎
This is the way, isn't it?

865
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,870
方向當然對  但是應該從東邊繞過去
'Course it is, but we should go around to the east.

866
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:42,870
那就不是去拿聖盃的路線了
That would take us out of the path of the chalices.

867
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:44,770
-我們可以繞回去  -沒那麼多時間
- Well, then we'll circle back. - There is no time.

868
01:14:44,910 --> 01:14:46,570
是你非要帶著那美人魚
You're the one who insisted on bringing the bloody mermaid.

869
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:48,700
-那你還組織叛變  -你走得還真像個娘們
- Well, the mutiny didn't help. - You walk like a girl.

870
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:50,940
-你想見識見識  -必須有人過去
- You would know. - Someone must go.

871
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:53,540
你是說分頭行動
You mean split up?

872
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:56,590
你是說有人跳下去吧  我也想看人跳下去
You mean jump? This I cannot wait to see.

873
01:14:56,720 --> 01:15:00,720
史派羅跳下去  找到船  拿回聖盃
Sparrow will go. Find the ship, retrieve the chalices.

874
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:02,860
史派羅  你覺得他還會回來嗎
Sparrow? What makes you think he will come back?

875
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:06,230
是啊  你覺得他還會回來嗎
Yes, what makes you think he will come back?

876
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:08,860
我們不能相信他  爸爸  讓我去
We cannot trust him, Father. I'll go.

877
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:11,430
她說她去
She'll go.

878
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,810
離泉水還有多遠
How much farther to the Fountain?

879
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:18,640
我沒有時間了
I'm running out of time.

880
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:22,780
大概沿著河  朝北走一天 
About a day's march north, following that river,

881
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:26,410
就會看到一堆水塘  那就快到了
you'll get to a series of pools. Then you're close.

882
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:30,150
跳吧
You will go.

883
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:35,360
我就知道會變成這樣
I was sure it would come to this.

884
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:50,530
你們知道站在高處時
You know that feeling you get

885
01:15:50,530 --> 01:15:53,110
有時候會有那麼一種
sometimes when you're standing in a high place?

886
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:55,180
特想往下跳的感覺嗎
Sudden urge to jump?

887
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,640
我就沒有這種感覺
I don't have it.

888
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:01,580
我需要聖盃
I need those chalices.

889
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:04,180
開槍吧  還省得我自己跳了
Shoot. Save me the bother of the fall.

890
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:07,380
你跳下去  然後來找我
You will go. You will return...

891
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:10,690
要不然  我就殺了她
...or I will kill her.

892
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,020
你不會殺自己的女兒
You won't kill your own daughter.

893
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:17,970
舵手  再給我拿六把手槍
Quartermaster, get me six more pistols,

894
01:16:18,110 --> 01:16:19,700
卸了子彈  留兩支槍埵酗l彈
remove the shot from all but two,

895
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,330
別告訴我是哪兩支
but do not tell me which two.

896
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:27,210
該你選了  史派羅
You get to choose, Mr. Sparrow.

897
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:31,180
不對
No.

898
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:34,410
不對
No.

899
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:40,360
-這個  -你確定
- Yes. - You're sure?

900
01:16:40,490 --> 01:16:41,960
當然確定
'Course I am.

901
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:51,230
再來
Again.

902
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:55,300
拜託  根本就沒子彈
Please, they're not even loaded.

903
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:01,510
再來
Again.

904
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:04,250
你要是那麼想殺了她
If you're so keen on killing her,

905
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:06,780
-為啥不讓她跳  -什麼
- why don't you just let her jump? - What?

906
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:10,050
如果你跳下去  跌死了
If you jump and die,

907
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:13,850
就輪到她了
then she will have her chance.

908
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:15,460
再來
Again.

909
01:17:20,730 --> 01:17:24,600
如果我跳下去  有活得可能嗎
...if I jump, will I survive?

910
01:17:26,910 --> 01:17:28,270
玩偶給我
The doll.

911
01:17:44,590 --> 01:17:49,360
-這樣你也許就死不了  -簡直胡扯  我跳
- Yes, now you will survive. - This is nonsense! I'm going!

912
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:11,310
濕了  又濕了
Wet. Wet again.

913
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:16,520
繼續出發  向北走
We go on. Due north to the Fountain.

914
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,720
演得不錯  父親
Well played, Father.

915
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:22,790
您早就知道哪兩把槍有子彈吧
You knew which guns were loaded, right?

916
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,490
當然  親愛的
Of course, my love.

917
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:39,870
要是有地圖就好了
Be nice to have a map about now.

918
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:41,670
或者有艘船也行
Or a ship.

919
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:46,150
站住  不許動
Stop! Hold very still.

920
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:51,110
不能讓它碰到你
Ye dare not let it touch your skin.

921
01:18:59,830 --> 01:19:03,100
怎麼  上了年紀的人有點愛好不行嗎
What? What be wrong with an older man having a hobby?

922
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,760
停下幹什麼  趕緊走
What are you stopping for, eh? Push on!

923
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:08,100
-趕緊走  -死了之後有你睡的
- Push on! - You can sleep when you're dead.

924
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:09,440
趕緊走
Push on!

925
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:14,380
幸運女神繼續眷顧我們
Fortune continues to favor us.

926
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:44,370
聖地亞哥
The Santiago.

927
01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:47,240
龐塞·德萊昂曾讓它享譽一時
Famously captained by Ponce de Leon.

928
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:51,480
沒有圍觀群眾
There's no one there.

929
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:52,610
好吧
Right, then.

930
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:28,720
不能停下
We must not stop.

931
01:20:36,730 --> 01:20:38,530
你得自己走
You will walk.

932
01:20:57,650 --> 01:20:59,810
我不會走
I cannot.

933
01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:01,750
不走就得死
Walk or die.

934
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:09,420
環著我的脖子
Put your arms around me.

935
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:12,960
-我沒要你幫我  -但你需要我的幫助
- I do not ask for help. - But you need it.

936
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:34,180
-不是趕路嗎  -別拖後腿
- We're in a hurry, yes? - Do not fall behind.

937
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:55,270
在這休息一會
Hold here 'til I say!

938
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,190
你真美
Such beauty.

939
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:13,660
你一定是上帝創造的
Surely you're one of God's own creations,

940
01:22:13,790 --> 01:22:16,730
不是那些未能踏上諾亞方舟的
and not a descendant of those dark creatures

941
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:19,160
黑暗而墮落生物的後代
who found no refuge on the Ark.

942
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:24,060
如此的美
Such beauty...

943
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:26,970
卻又致命
...and yet deadly.

944
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:31,400
-致命?  不  -你攻擊了我
- Deadly? No. - You attacked me.

945
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:36,500
不  你不同
No. You are different.

946
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:38,650
不同嗎
Different?

947
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:42,780
不是嗎  你保護了我  
Are you not? You protect.

948
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:47,250
是嗎
Did you?

949
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:51,690
你把我推開了
You pushed me down out of the way.

950
01:22:52,830 --> 01:22:57,330
-你看見不老泉了嗎  -沒有  但已經很近了
- You see the Fountain? - No, but we are close.

951
01:22:57,870 --> 01:22:59,740
帶上那生物  捂上她的頭
Bring the creature. Cover its head.

952
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:01,860
她有名字
She has a name!

953
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:07,900
請講
Pray tell.

954
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:16,020
她是塞蕾娜
She is Syrena.

955
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,490
龐塞·德萊昂
Ponce de Leon.

956
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:05,870
四十個海盜連著四十個晚上夢見的財寶
If 40 pirates dreamt 40 nights of treasure,

957
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:09,600
也趕不上這屋堛滌]寶   
it would not match the contents of this room.

958
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:11,300
是你
You.

959
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,880
-你  -不   
- You. - No...

960
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:19,310
-你  -是我先來的
-...you. - I was here first.

961
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:23,480
-你為什麼來這  -黑鬍子派我來的   
- You, why are you here? - Blackbeard sent me.

962
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:26,110
-你呢  -銀聖盃  
- Why are you? - Silver chalices

963
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:29,630
-為我的陛下  -得了
- for my royal liege. - Oh, please.

964
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:32,660
後退  後退  我們必須保證船的平衡
Back, back! We have to balance it out!

965
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:37,230
這船會滑下去   
The whole ship will slide!

966
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:42,630
那好吧
Right, then.

967
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:48,710
那要是我們各選一樣差不多沉的東西呢
What if we each choose an item of approximately equal weight?

968
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:52,820
放回去   
Put it back!

969
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,380
我們什麼也不能動   
We touch nothing!

970
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:05,260
那個呢
What about that?

971
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:07,800
聖盃 
The chalices.

972
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:11,030
憑什麼你先看
Oi! Why do you get to look first?

973
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:12,870
那好吧
Fine, then.

974
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:33,680
-一起看  -一起看   
- Together. - Together.

975
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,420
石頭
Rocks.

976
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,860
那些西班牙佬
The Spanish.

977
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:42,260
夥計  他們比我們早來一步   
They're ahead of us, mate.

978
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:46,430
我該看看那地圖  要是我想的沒錯...
I shall have a look at that map. If it's what I fear...

979
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:58,750
他們怎麼會把這東西留下   
I wonder why they left this behind.

980
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:05,520
別碰那地圖   
Don't touch the map.

981
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:11,960
他們知道了路線   
They know the path,

982
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:16,000
但我也知道他們最可能在哪駐營
but I can also see where they'll most likely make camp.

983
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:30,780
傑克
Jack!

984
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:38,120
吉布斯  我正要去監獄救你來著
Gibbs, I was just on me way to break you out of jail.

985
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:41,580
你偷了我的地圖   
You stole my map.

986
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:44,600
好了  行動
Right. Best be started.

987
01:27:06,550 --> 01:27:08,040
美人魚 
Mermaids.

988
01:27:10,890 --> 01:27:13,830
小心  這些水塘很深   
Careful, these pools run deep.

989
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:17,520
如果她逃了  就全完了  舵手   
If she escapes, all is lost. Quartermaster.

990
01:27:19,170 --> 01:27:22,460
看  看好了
Look. Look!

991
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:27,010
她被繫在樁上  在太陽下暴曬
Staked out to die, to dry in the sun.

992
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:30,740
身體一半在水中  不夠活命
Only half in the water. Not enough to live,

993
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:35,070
只能慢慢死去
but just enough to make the dying slow.

994
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:37,310
考慮一下吧   
Think on it.

995
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:40,850
你的族群被殺害  只是為了眼淚   
Your people, murdered, harvested for their tears.

996
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:45,320
塞蕾娜  你難道不想哭嗎   
Syrena, won't you cry?

997
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:48,020
你也難逃一死
All die, even you.

998
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:51,620
-快了  -聽著   
- Soon, I hear. - Listen...

999
01:27:53,670 --> 01:27:55,530
聽好了
Listen.

1000
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:59,000
你難道聽不到你姐妹們的呼喊
Can you not hear your sisters scream?

1001
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:01,570
聽不到嗎
Do you not hear them?

1002
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:05,410
我們只需要一滴眼淚   
We need but one tear.

1003
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:09,580
下賤的生物
Vile creature!

1004
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:12,310
-一根根切掉她的手指  -掐死她   
- Chop off her fingers, one by one! - Choke her!

1005
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:15,050
從眼睛底下挖出眼淚來   
Cut out the tears from behind the eyes!

1006
01:28:15,190 --> 01:28:16,520
你看得下去嗎
Where's your voice in this?

1007
01:28:17,390 --> 01:28:20,420
也許日出後她就轉變心意了
Maybe she'll have a change of heart when the sun rises.

1008
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:24,460
對  她會灼傷  但我等不到日出 
Oh, aye, she will burn, but I cannot wait for the sun.

1009
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:26,330
也許我們應該生把火
Perhaps we should build a fire.

1010
01:28:26,430 --> 01:28:28,590
-不行  -不准質疑我  教士   
- No. - Do not contest me, cleric.

1011
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:31,800
-你們不准折磨她  -我們只需要一滴眼淚   
- You will not torture her. - We need only one tear.

1012
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:35,100
可以的話  我會把她的鱗一片一片剝下來
I will tear every scale from her body one by one if I see fit.

1013
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:36,800
要是你不滿意  祈禱去吧
If that displeases you, go pray.

1014
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:40,070
我錯了  並不是所有靈魂都能拯救  你無藥可救
I was wrong. Not every soul can be saved. Yours cannot.

1015
01:28:40,210 --> 01:28:43,080
看啊  各位  曾經有信仰的人
Behold, gentlemen, a man formerly of faith.

1016
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:46,120
你說她是卑賤的生物  但你還趕不上她萬分之一     
That vile creature, as you call her, is worth a hundred of you.

1017
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:48,020
喲  你關心她   
Oh, you care for her?

1018
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:52,050
你愛她   
You fancy her.

1019
01:28:53,730 --> 01:28:56,460
我看得一清二楚  別否認這份感情
And do not deny what is clear to my eyes.

1020
01:28:58,260 --> 01:28:59,390
問題是   
Question is...

1021
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:04,560
她愛不愛你   
...does she fancy you?

1022
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:10,400
老天爺  她還真愛你  走運了
My God, she does. We are in luck!

1023
01:29:11,810 --> 01:29:13,710
流下一滴眼淚
Bring forth a tear...

1024
01:29:15,210 --> 01:29:17,740
或見證這可憐生命的消亡   
...or witness the death of this poor soul.

1025
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:23,320
塞蕾娜  如果你能流下一滴眼淚   
Syrena, if you could manage a tear,

1026
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:25,050
我將萬分感激
I would be grateful.

1027
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:27,980
悲傷  是有
Sadness, yes,

1028
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:33,530
-但卻並不悲痛  -別髒了您的手  父親   
- but no sorrow... yet. - Not by your hand, Father!

1029
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:36,330
時間不等人  舵手
Time and tide wait for none. Quartermaster.

1030
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:52,140
美人魚還真難搞   
Aye, mermaids are tough.

1031
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:54,310
都夠難搞的
The lot of them.

1032
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:58,860
把她綁起來  把這屍體處理了   
Tie her up like the others. And get rid of this.

1033
01:30:03,430 --> 01:30:06,420
-你有信心嗎  -有
- You are confident? - Yes.

1034
01:30:06,530 --> 01:30:09,520
我是女人  她也是
I am a woman. So is she.

1035
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:20,570
你這是演的哪一出  傑克  和巴博薩搭起伙來了
What's your play, Jack? Throwing in with Barbossa.

1036
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:23,440
有個姑娘...   
There is a girl...

1037
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:26,780
...一個女性...異性   
...A female... of the opposite sex.

1038
01:30:26,890 --> 01:30:30,850
-姑娘不是異性是什麼  -也許應該說是少女   
- When is there not? - Perhaps I should say "Damsel."

1039
01:30:30,990 --> 01:30:34,020
-你還救少女嗎  -萬事總有第一次
- You're rescuing a damsel? - Well, there's a first.

1040
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:37,390
但有可能我讓這個所謂的少女 
Yes, but it's just that I may have caused said damsel

1041
01:30:37,530 --> 01:30:41,130
-幾個月前受傷了  -不奇怪
- some manner of harm many moons ago. - Out with it.

1042
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:44,570
吉布斯  她是個塞維利亞的女人
Gibbs, this is the woman from Seville.

1043
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:46,430
你裝作喜歡她   
Ah, you pretended to love her,

1044
01:30:46,430 --> 01:30:48,610
結果你離開她  傷了她的心
then you left her and broke her heart.

1045
01:30:48,770 --> 01:30:53,470
比這更糟  我也許是  簡短地說  就是
Worse. I may have had, briefly, mind you...

1046
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:58,810
-造成了她內心波動  -波動     
- ...stirrings. - Stirrings?

1047
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:02,910
-波動  -什麼  就是有感情了吧   
- Stirrings. - What? Like feelings, you mean?

1048
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:06,080
不不不  不是那個意思  更像是...   
No, no, no. Not quite all the way to feelings. More like...

1049
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:11,820
好吧  就是感情  該死的
All right, feelings, damn you.

1050
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:16,630
結果你還是離開了她  夠低級的
And you left her still. That's low.

1051
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:19,300
謝謝   
Thank you.

1052
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:27,650
秘密行動 
Stealth over force.

1053
01:31:27,810 --> 01:31:31,540
接下來我搞定好了  你不太方便
I'll take it from here on account of your condition.

1054
01:31:32,690 --> 01:31:34,550
你沒招白蟻吧     
You don't have termites, do you?

1055
01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:36,660
感謝你的關心  傑克
I appreciate your concern, Jack,

1056
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:39,310
但我還是會盯著你
but I'll be keeping you company all the same.

1057
01:31:39,490 --> 01:31:42,550
在這等著  大副  等我指示  
Hold here, Lieutenant Commander. Wait for my signal.

1058
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:16,620
那邊那個  就是頭領
There. That one. That be the leader.

1059
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:19,250
記住他的帳篷  那就是...
Make note of his tent because that's where...

1060
01:32:20,730 --> 01:32:24,970
等等  老天  那肯定就是聖盃了
No, wait. My God, that must be them right there.

1061
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:30,700
你的劍聞起來很搞笑   
Your sword smells funny.

1062
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:35,780
是  我塗了蟾蜍內臟的毒
Aye. Poison from the innards of poisonous toads.

1063
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:39,010
蹭一下  幾分鐘內你就死了
Just a scratch, you're a dead man in minutes.

1064
01:32:39,150 --> 01:32:41,480
你能不能別用劍指著我   
Would you mind pointing it the other way?

1065
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:43,380
我不喜歡蟾蜍   
I don't like toads.

1066
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:51,700
-你在幹嘛  -計劃逃生路線 
- What are you doing? - Planning an escape route.

1067
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:55,930
-你不也這樣計劃嗎  -當然   
- Isn't that how you do it? - Yes.

1068
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:59,160
不過有時候我只是...即興發揮
Or sometimes I just... improvise.

1069
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:27,660
現在怎麼辦
Now what?

1070
01:33:28,530 --> 01:33:31,060
咱們逛出去  慢而堅定
We stroll out, slow and steady.

1071
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,030
理所應當一樣   
Just like we belong.

1072
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:36,730
-抱歉  塞蕾娜  -菲利普  你還活著
- I'm sorry, Syrena. - Philip, you're alive.

1073
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:41,070
-是  -你來救我嗎   
- Yes. - You came for me.

1074
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:44,430
為什麼   
Why?

1075
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:48,840
你是不同的吧
You're different, are you not?

1076
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:55,420
你善良  有同情心  是吧
Do you know not of kindness? Compassion?

1077
01:35:12,610 --> 01:35:14,600
悲痛才不會讓它們落淚
Tears of sorrow, never.

1078
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:17,170
美人魚太堅強了   
Mermaids be too tough for that.

1079
01:35:17,310 --> 01:35:19,470
但喜悅的眼淚   
But tears of joy...

1080
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:23,410
都說這更有效
They say these be the more potent anyway.

1081
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:26,510
塞蕾娜  我發誓  我並不知情   
Syrena, on my word, I had no part in this.

1082
01:35:27,790 --> 01:35:29,220
放她走吧  你現在不需要她了
Let her go. You don't need her now.

1083
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:32,320
放她走  沒門
Let her go? No.

1084
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:35,450
把她捆好  讓她自生自滅
Secure her bonds. We leave her with her own.

1085
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
想出什麼逃跑方案了嗎
How's that escape route working?

1086
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:50,110
展示你隨機應變的時刻到了
Here's your chance to improvise.

1087
01:35:50,210 --> 01:35:51,540
我在想呢
I'm attempting it.

1088
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:54,510
大概我能鬆出一只手
I might be able to get a hand loose.

1089
01:35:54,650 --> 01:35:56,910
你帶著刀呢  非常好
Oh, you got a knife. That's very good.

1090
01:35:58,020 --> 01:35:59,540
比刀還好
Better.

1091
01:36:04,990 --> 01:36:06,250
我也要喝
I want one of those.

1092
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:15,200
復仇真是甜美甘洌啊
Here's to revenge. Sweet and clear.

1093
01:36:15,330 --> 01:36:19,790
-什麼復仇  -得了吧  赫克托
- Revenge? - Come, come, Hector.

1094
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:21,340
你如果想要那聖盃
If you wanted the chalices,

1095
01:36:21,470 --> 01:36:24,170
你會眼睜睜看著它落入他人囊中嗎
you'd seen they were missing and gone.

1096
01:36:24,310 --> 01:36:27,470
你在伺機候著黑鬍子
You were lying in wait, for Blackbeard.

1097
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:32,680
喬治國王  私掠船  假髮
King George. Privateer. Wig.

1098
01:36:33,820 --> 01:36:35,250
這些伎倆太低級了
Cheap theatrical facade.

1099
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:38,250
-我才不信呢  -那晚你沒在
- I'm not buying it. - You weren't there that night.

1100
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:39,990
黑珍珠沉沒的時候嗎
When the Pearl was lost?

1101
01:36:39,990 --> 01:36:42,220
不是沉沒  是被奪走了
Taken, not lost.

1102
01:36:44,830 --> 01:36:48,960
我們剛從伊斯島起航就遭到了襲擊
We were off the coast of Hispaniola when we came under attack.

1103
01:36:49,130 --> 01:36:52,570
沒有徵兆  沒有警告  也沒有談判
No provocation nor warning nor offer of parley.

1104
01:36:52,710 --> 01:36:55,370
上來就是連天的炮火
We were peppered with cannon fire.

1105
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:59,740
隨後  海面翻滾起來
And then the sea beneath the Pearl began to roil.

1106
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,710
黑珍珠開始劇烈晃動
The Pearl was pitching and yawing violently.

1107
01:37:03,850 --> 01:37:05,710
每塊甲板  每道欄杆
Every plank, every rail,

1108
01:37:05,850 --> 01:37:08,720
每根船桿全都開始吱嘎作響
every spar, all at once, began to creak.

1109
01:37:08,850 --> 01:37:11,880
帆纜也好像有了生命
The rigging had come to life.

1110
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:14,720
我們的船叛變了
Our own ship turned against us...

1111
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:18,130
纜繩就像毒蛇一樣纏住船員
...tangling the crew, wrapping around 'em like snakes.

1112
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:20,660
纏住我的腿
And wrapping around me leg.

1113
01:37:20,830 --> 01:37:23,230
但我的胳膊還能動  劍也還在手
But me arms were free and me sword was to hand.

1114
01:37:23,370 --> 01:37:26,900
我才是這船的主人  不是黑鬍子
I am the master of me ship, not Blackbeard.

1115
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:30,530
我才是自己命運的主人  不是黑鬍子
I am the master of my fate, not Blackbeard.

1116
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:33,910
所以我就採取了必要措施
So I did what needed done.

1117
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:42,690
我活了下來
I survived.

1118
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:48,450
也就是說  你不是要找不老泉
So... you're not after the Fountain.

1119
01:37:48,590 --> 01:37:52,260
我才不在乎國王的命令
I care not for King George or tavern yarns

1120
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,630
還是傳聞說能治癒這瘸腿
that give hope for a healed limb.

1121
01:37:56,270 --> 01:37:59,930
但要是能幹掉黑鬍子  叫我犧牲左臂也情願
But I'd give my left arm for a chance at Blackbeard.

1122
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:03,110
-幹嘛不是右臂  -右臂要留著
- Not your right? - I need me good arm

1123
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:07,910
揮舞毒劍  刺穿他的心臟
to drive my poisoned blade through his heart.

1124
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,320
看來你的機會來了  夥計
I'll see you get the chance, mate.

1125
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:31,390
犯人逃跑了
The prisoner's escaping.

1126
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:41,370
他逃了  扇形散開  抓住他
He's escaping! Fan out! Find him!

1127
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:42,600
快跑
Go! Go!

1128
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:47,540
別開槍  我要抓活的
Hold your fire! I want him alive!

1129
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:57,720
我想那是信號
I figured that was the signal.

1130
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:44,290
-準備撤離  -敵人很快就追來了
- Go! Prepare to move out! - The enemy is soon upon us.

1131
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:47,310
聖盃的事我很遺憾
I'm sorry about the chalices,

1132
01:40:47,310 --> 01:40:48,970
傑克  但我還得赴個約
Jack, but I've an appointment to keep.

1133
01:40:49,110 --> 01:40:52,100
-我不會回去  -不用
- I'll not be going back. - No need.

1134
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:55,270
-喝一杯怎麼樣  -到了不老泉再喝
- Shall we have a drink? - We'll drink at the Fountain.

1135
01:41:13,630 --> 01:41:17,190
我們每次見面你都要衝我舞刀弄劍嗎
How is it we can never meet without you pointing something at me?

1136
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,300
聖盃帶來了嗎  史派羅
You brought the chalices, Sparrow?

1137
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:23,030
當然
Aye. Oi!

1138
01:41:26,510 --> 01:41:29,640
-你還帶了個朋友  -是的
- I see you brought a friend. - I did.

1139
01:41:29,780 --> 01:41:33,010
那個獨腿海盜也在附近吧
And the one-legged man, he is near. Aye?

1140
01:41:33,150 --> 01:41:34,550
是的
Aye.

1141
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:36,380
現在
Now...

1142
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:38,000
在我交出它們之前
Before I go just handing them over,

1143
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,360
我有那麼一兩個要求
I do have one or two conditions.

1144
01:41:39,490 --> 01:41:41,550
-快說  -首先
- Name them. - Firstly,

1145
01:41:41,690 --> 01:41:44,060
我想要回指南針  不不  那是第二個
I'll be having me compass back. No, no, that's secondly.

1146
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:46,460
第一  你要答應
Firstly, upon your word,

1147
01:41:46,570 --> 01:41:48,560
絕不會傷害安琪莉卡
you will bring no harm to Angelica.

1148
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:51,070
我不會對你這種人保證什麼  史派羅
I'll make no vows to the likes of you, Sparrow.

1149
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:53,670
但也不妨承認
But it costs me nothing to admit

1150
01:41:53,810 --> 01:41:56,670
她永遠不會受到傷害
that she was never in harm's way.

1151
01:41:57,310 --> 01:41:59,500
那麼第二條  就是之前的第一條
Secondly then, priorly firstly,

1152
01:41:59,650 --> 01:42:01,270
把指南針還我
I will be having me compass back.

1153
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:04,210
拜託了  這是我應得的
Please? I do deserve it.

1154
01:42:04,350 --> 01:42:05,620
你知不知道
Do you have any idea how

1155
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:07,840
抓住這頭臭豬有多費勁
difficult it was to catch that filthy pig?

1156
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:10,350
不是大的那頭  是四條腿的那頭
Not the big one, the four-legged one.

1157
01:42:13,790 --> 01:42:17,560
謝謝  第三條  鬍子先生
Thank you. And thirdly, Mr. Beard,

1158
01:42:17,700 --> 01:42:20,390
有的時候  偶爾
there are times, not very often,

1159
01:42:20,530 --> 01:42:23,630
我會回想起自己卑劣的所作所為
when I do reflect upon my heinous misdeeds.

1160
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:28,070
尤其是我對吉布斯先生的做法
Chief among them, I note how poorly I have treated Mr. Gibbs,

1161
01:42:28,210 --> 01:42:30,870
-我那忠心的大副  -現在你才說...
- my loyal first mate. - Aye! Now you bring it up...

1162
01:42:31,010 --> 01:42:33,710
那會我任由他在監獄受罪  毫不關心
Left him to rot in jail, I did. Didn't care.

1163
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:38,510
現在我也不關心  但問題是你得放他走
Still don't. But, point being, you must let him go free.

1164
01:42:40,350 --> 01:42:43,720
-就這樣嗎  -我想是的
- Is that it? - I think so.

1165
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:46,450
快決定  否則豬跑了看你怎麼拿回杯子
Quick, or the pig runs, and good luck getting those chalices.

1166
01:42:46,590 --> 01:42:48,060
傑克  如果你不在乎這杯子  那我情願...
Jack, if it's all the same to you, I'd be just as...

1167
01:42:48,190 --> 01:42:49,520
成交
Done.

1168
01:42:49,630 --> 01:42:50,860
放開那豬吧
Release the swine.

1169
01:42:56,640 --> 01:42:57,950
如果你不介意
Perhaps, if you don't mind,

1170
01:42:57,950 --> 01:42:59,900
我或許可以跟你們一起...
I could tag along with you folk for a...

1171
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:04,910
這能帶你走向自由  夥計
This will lead you to freedom, mate.

1172
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:14,450
我發誓就在這附近
I could have swore it was somewhere right around here.

1173
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:46,910
我們不能停下
We must not stop.

1174
01:45:04,230 --> 01:45:05,660
死路
Dead end.

1175
01:45:06,670 --> 01:45:08,600
死路  結束了
Dead. End.

1176
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:10,700
死路
Dead end.

1177
01:45:11,740 --> 01:45:14,710
傑克  你知不知道要怎麼走
Jack, I'm starting to think you don't know where you're going.

1178
01:45:15,510 --> 01:45:18,340
人們說  沿途風景要勝過目的地
It is not the destination so much as the journey, they say.

1179
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:21,010
請把聖盃給我
Chalices, if you please.

1180
01:45:33,020 --> 01:45:34,550
退後
Stand back.

1181
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:58,470
傑克
Jack...

1182
01:45:58,620 --> 01:46:00,550
你到底有沒有
...have you ever, in fact...

1183
01:46:00,690 --> 01:46:06,180
親眼見過不老泉
...seen with your own eyes... the Fountain of Youth?

1184
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:08,520
抱歉  你說什麼來著
I'm sorry, could you repeat the question, please?

1185
01:46:08,690 --> 01:46:10,160
舵手
Quartermaster.

1186
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:12,060
不不
No, no!

1187
01:46:15,730 --> 01:46:17,860
等等
Wait, wait! Wait.

1188
01:46:21,140 --> 01:46:25,600
生命...之水[西班牙語]
"Aqua... de Vida."

1189
01:47:04,950 --> 01:47:07,480
史考姆先生
Master Scrum...

1190
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:10,490
-如果你不介意  -拿著這個嗎
- ...do you mind? - Squire?

1191
01:48:09,180 --> 01:48:11,170
真美
So beautiful.

1192
01:48:50,660 --> 01:48:53,280
史派羅  我要第一個喝那泉水
Sparrow, I'll be the first to taste those waters.

1193
01:48:57,760 --> 01:48:59,350
父親
Father.

1194
01:49:02,630 --> 01:49:04,930
獨腿海盜
The one-legged man.

1195
01:49:07,470 --> 01:49:11,430
-你把他引來這  -我會那麼做嗎
- You brought him here. - Would I do that?

1196
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:13,670
愛德華·提奇
Edward Teach!

1197
01:49:13,810 --> 01:49:17,110
鑒於你在公海犯下的種種罪行
For crimes committed on the high seas,

1198
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:21,120
國王陛下賦予我職權
by the authority granted me by His Majesty the King...

1199
01:49:21,250 --> 01:49:24,450
同時我個人也相當樂意
...and with a goodly amount of personal satisfaction...

1200
01:49:24,590 --> 01:49:27,650
拘押逮捕你
...I hereby place you in the custody of the court,

1201
01:49:27,790 --> 01:49:31,130
你是我的階下囚
and declare you to be my prisoner.

1202
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:35,690
我氣數已盡了吧
My trick's out, is that it?

1203
01:49:35,830 --> 01:49:40,270
罪名包括但不限於  海盜行為  通姦叛國
Such crimes do include, but are not limited to, piracy, treason,

1204
01:49:40,370 --> 01:49:44,540
蓄意謀殺以及殘酷折磨
murder, torture of the most heinous sort,

1205
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:48,610
包括野蠻奪走一條飽經風霜的右腿
including the brutal theft of one used, twisted, hairy right leg.

1206
01:49:49,380 --> 01:49:54,080
你不怕面對這把劍嗎
You... dare face this sword?

1207
01:49:54,250 --> 01:49:56,690
這堣S不是你的船  當然不怕
This far away from your ship? Aye.

1208
01:49:56,820 --> 01:50:01,550
我能感到後背吹來冰冷的命運之息
Aye. That be the cold breath of fate I feel down my nape.

1209
01:50:01,690 --> 01:50:07,360
但老天作證  我要打這最後一戰
But I'll have one last fight, by God.

1210
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:09,230
殺光他們
Kill 'em all!

1211
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:12,670
等一下
Hang on a minute.

1212
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:16,710
我只想弄清一件事
I just... I just need to understand something.

1213
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:20,210
你們要打他們
Right, so, you will fight against them,

1214
01:50:20,350 --> 01:50:21,680
他們又要打你們
they will fight against you.

1215
01:50:21,810 --> 01:50:25,510
而這只是因為他想要殺他
All on account of him wanting to kill him?

1216
01:50:25,650 --> 01:50:28,010
這是什麼邏輯
Where is the sense?

1217
01:50:28,010 --> 01:50:29,590
對吧
Exactly.

1218
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:33,450
要我說不如讓他們自己去打
I say, let them fight each other while we lay back,

1219
01:50:33,630 --> 01:50:37,060
我們退後觀戰  喝喝酒賭賭錢
watch, have a drink, place some wagers!

1220
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:39,460
好
Aye.

1221
01:50:42,030 --> 01:50:43,660
-殺掉他們  -不要憐憫敵人
- Kill 'em! - No quarter!

1222
01:51:14,130 --> 01:51:15,790
滾開
Get off me!

1223
01:51:48,770 --> 01:51:49,790
史考姆  聖盃
Scrum, the chalices!

1224
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:53,060
帶上眼淚  跟我來
And the tear! Follow!

1225
01:51:57,080 --> 01:51:58,270
打啊
Fight!

1226
01:51:59,180 --> 01:52:02,740
交出眼淚來  好孩子
Hand it over. The tear. There's a good lad.

1227
01:52:02,850 --> 01:52:05,180
我更怕她一些
I'm more afraid of her than I am of you.

1228
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:13,120
交出來  好孩子
Hand it over. There's a good lad.

1229
01:52:16,490 --> 01:52:20,230
-把聖盃給我  -抱歉  傑克
- The chalices, if you please. - Sorry, Jack.

1230
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:24,630
我說過我需要壽命  看來用你的就行
I told you, I need years. And now, yours will do.

1231
01:52:32,540 --> 01:52:33,770
史考姆
Scrum!

1232
01:52:55,430 --> 01:52:56,900
塞蕾娜
Syrena...

1233
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:03,400
主啊  不要帶走她
Oh God, you will not take her.

1234
01:53:03,540 --> 01:53:08,500
如果你帶走了她  還她回來吧
If you have taken her, you will give her back.

1235
01:53:08,650 --> 01:53:11,010
還她回來
Give her back...

1236
01:53:11,150 --> 01:53:14,020
還她回來  求你了
Give her back, please. Please.

1237
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:40,370
我還期待命運給我安排個硬角色呢
I expected fate to put up more of a fight, eh?

1238
01:53:57,230 --> 01:54:01,030
你被我打到在地  有什麼好高興的
I will not have that smile on your face as I strike you down.

1239
01:54:02,430 --> 01:54:05,530
回頭看看吧  愛德華·提奇
Take a gander, Edward Teach.

1240
01:54:36,070 --> 01:54:39,370
吾茲宣佈  這片土地歸偉大的
This land is hereby forever claimed in the glorious name

1241
01:54:39,540 --> 01:54:42,100
喬治國王陛下所有...
of His Majesty King George...

1242
01:54:48,350 --> 01:54:51,280
找人記錄下那人的英勇行為
Someone make a note of that man's bravery.

1243
01:54:58,260 --> 01:55:01,990
小姐  請把聖盃交出來
Senorita, the chalices, por favor.

1244
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:21,510
只有上帝才能賦予人永生
Only God can grant eternal life,

1245
01:55:21,510 --> 01:55:24,340
而不是這邪惡的泉水
not this pagan water.

1246
01:55:35,390 --> 01:55:38,890
士兵們  毀掉這褻瀆神聖的寺廟
Men, destroy this profane temple!

1247
01:55:41,630 --> 01:55:42,960
不老泉
The Fountain!

1248
01:55:57,020 --> 01:55:58,540
你這個蠢貨
You are a fool.

1249
01:55:58,680 --> 01:56:01,980
你在這追尋的東西  只有信仰才能提供
You seek in this place what only faith can provide.

1250
01:56:02,090 --> 01:56:04,650
信仰?  確實有照亮世界的光明
Faith? In faith, there is light enough to see

1251
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:07,020
但也有吞噬萬物的黑暗
but darkness enough to blind.

1252
01:56:10,630 --> 01:56:12,890
這是在搞什麼鬼
What devilry is this?

1253
01:56:16,870 --> 01:56:19,460
-為了黑珍珠號  -你做了什麼
- For the Pearl. - What have you done?

1254
01:56:23,010 --> 01:56:25,410
安琪莉卡  別碰  有毒
Angelica! Don't! It's poison!

1255
01:56:30,050 --> 01:56:32,380
不用一點惡毒的伎倆
I'm not such the fool to take on Blackbeard

1256
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:35,920
就想對付黑鬍子  我還沒這麼天真
without a little venomous advantage.

1257
01:56:37,220 --> 01:56:38,710
傑克
Jack!

1258
01:56:50,540 --> 01:56:52,590
黑鬍子的船和船員歸我所有
I claim Blackbeard's ship and crew,

1259
01:56:52,740 --> 01:56:56,170
還有這把劍  以此補償我失去的右腿
and this sword, payment for my missing limb!

1260
01:57:10,590 --> 01:57:11,990
抓緊  用力拉
Hang on! Pull!

1261
01:57:57,270 --> 01:57:59,630
別浪費我的眼淚
Do not waste my tear.

1262
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:31,230
喝了這個  這杯埵陴散\
Drink this. This one has the tear.

1263
01:58:31,370 --> 01:58:33,360
-你得喝另一杯  -不
- You must drink the other. - No!

1264
01:58:34,140 --> 01:58:37,370
你們只有一個能活  另一個必須犧牲
I cannot save you both. One of you must sacrifice.

1265
01:58:38,310 --> 01:58:41,400
喝了它  父親  拯救你的靈魂
You take it, Father, for your soul.

1266
01:58:43,450 --> 01:58:48,890
提奇船長  她快死了  你得救你的女兒
Captain Teach, she's dying. You must save your daughter.

1267
01:58:50,050 --> 01:58:52,850
這一杯是奪走生命的嗎
This one takes life?

1268
01:58:52,990 --> 01:58:54,860
這一杯有眼淚能賦予生命
This one has the tear and gives life?

1269
01:58:54,990 --> 01:58:56,250
對  快喝
Aye, hurry!

1270
01:59:05,170 --> 01:59:09,440
安琪莉卡  救我  孩子
Angelica... Save me, my child.

1271
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:12,780
不
No.

1272
01:59:21,490 --> 01:59:22,920
我愛你  父親
I love you, Father.

1273
01:59:35,900 --> 01:59:37,530
等等
Wait a minute.

1274
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:42,540
事實上  好像弄反了
In fact, it might have been the other way around.

1275
01:59:43,370 --> 01:59:47,210
這一杯有眼淚  那一杯沒有
This cup had the tear, that one had the other bit.

1276
01:59:47,310 --> 01:59:48,570
騙子
Trickster!

1277
01:59:48,710 --> 01:59:50,580
-惡魔  -父親
- Devil! - Father!

1278
01:59:57,590 --> 01:59:59,110
你這混蛋  你怎麼敢
You bastard! How could you?

1279
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:01,590
你父親救了你
Your father saved you.

1280
02:00:01,730 --> 02:00:04,250
或許他的靈魂現在得到了救贖
Perhaps his soul is now redeemed, eh?

1281
02:01:05,060 --> 02:01:07,180
你受傷了
You are hurt.

1282
02:01:09,390 --> 02:01:11,330
只是身體受傷
In body only.

1283
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:17,230
我的心靈很平靜...因為你
My mind is at peace... because of you.

1284
02:01:18,300 --> 02:01:21,170
-我  -對
- Me? - Yes.

1285
02:01:22,170 --> 02:01:24,570
我曾迷失了自己
I was lost.

1286
02:01:25,540 --> 02:01:30,210
那狂風大浪
The wind, the tides...

1287
02:01:30,350 --> 02:01:33,410
應該能改變一個人的信仰
...they ought to renew a man's faith.

1288
02:01:34,990 --> 02:01:36,920
但對我而言  只有你能
But for me, only you.

1289
02:01:37,820 --> 02:01:41,550
菲利普  我可以救你
Philip, I can save you.

1290
02:01:41,690 --> 02:01:44,660
你只需開口請求我
You need only ask.

1291
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:50,900
-我只求你一件事  -什麼
- I seek but one thing. - What is that?

1292
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:54,270
寬恕
Forgiveness.

1293
02:01:54,410 --> 02:01:57,740
如果不是我  你就不會被抓
If not for me, you would never have been captured.

1294
02:01:57,880 --> 02:01:59,540
開口吧
Ask.

1295
02:02:01,410 --> 02:02:03,240
寬恕我
Forgive me?

1296
02:02:28,370 --> 02:02:29,600
我恨你
I hate you.

1297
02:02:29,740 --> 02:02:32,070
恨那個救了你的人嗎
The bloke who saved your life?

1298
02:02:32,210 --> 02:02:35,410
我的生命是從我父親那偷來的
The years I possess, stolen from my own father!

1299
02:02:35,550 --> 02:02:38,570
我只是幫黑鬍子盡了父親的責任
I only helped Blackbeard do what any father should have done.

1300
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:41,910
你個冷血自大的混蛋
You are cruel and ignorant.

1301
02:02:45,620 --> 02:02:49,420
一把手槍  一枚子彈
One pistol, one shot.

1302
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:51,790
好讓我在餓死前飲彈自盡嗎
To kill myself before I starve?

1303
02:02:51,930 --> 02:02:53,490
我可不信你會這麼做  寶貝
There's no trusting you, love.

1304
02:02:53,630 --> 02:02:56,100
再說了  這堬謚成茤嘛W繁
Besides, this is a well-traveled trade route.

1305
02:02:56,230 --> 02:02:57,830
你可以向它們發送求救信號
You can signal a passing ship.

1306
02:02:57,970 --> 02:03:01,430
或者像俗語說的那樣啃啃子彈
Or you can just bite the proverbial bullet, as it were.

1307
02:02:57,970 --> 02:03:01,430
喻指咬緊牙關  忍受苦難的現實

1308
02:03:01,570 --> 02:03:03,160
我怎麼才能弄開這些繩子
And how will I get free of these bonds?

1309
02:03:03,310 --> 02:03:06,070
半小時前你就掙開了
You broke free of your bonds half an hour ago,

1310
02:03:06,180 --> 02:03:09,010
等待襲擊的最佳時刻
waiting for the precise moment to pounce.

1311
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:13,410
承認吧  傑克
Admit it, Jack.

1312
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:17,450
-你還愛著我  -如果你有個妹妹和一條狗
- You still love me. - If you had a sister and a dog,

1313
02:03:17,590 --> 02:03:19,890
我會選擇狗
I'd choose the dog.

1314
02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:23,420
寶藏  有個裝滿珠寶的箱子
Treasure! There is a chest with jewels!

1315
02:03:23,530 --> 02:03:25,790
擁有征服風浪力量的珠寶
Jewels with the power to rule the wind and tide!

1316
02:03:25,930 --> 02:03:29,020
-你編的吧  -等等
- You're making that up! - Wait...

1317
02:03:29,830 --> 02:03:33,530
我有身孕了  你的
I am with child. Yours.

1318
02:03:34,770 --> 02:03:36,170
我不記得我們有過...
I don't recall that we ever had...

1319
02:03:36,310 --> 02:03:39,040
-你當時醉了  -我從沒醉到那種程度
- You were drunk! - I've actually never been that drunk.

1320
02:03:39,180 --> 02:03:40,300
等等
Wait!

1321
02:03:42,180 --> 02:03:44,240
我有件事要告訴你
There is something I want to say to you.

1322
02:03:44,420 --> 02:03:48,580
我們第一次相見時我就想說了
Something I wanted to say from the moment we first met.

1323
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:50,650
那就說吧
Go on, then.

1324
02:03:52,990 --> 02:03:54,320
我愛你
I love you.

1325
02:03:57,900 --> 02:03:59,730
我也是
As do I.

1326
02:03:59,860 --> 02:04:03,320
以前愛  今後也愛
Always have. Always will.

1327
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:09,330
我得走了
I gotta go.

1328
02:04:09,470 --> 02:04:10,500
傑克
Jack!

1329
02:04:12,810 --> 02:04:14,400
這事沒完
This is not over!

1330
02:04:15,480 --> 02:04:16,540
傑克
Jack!

1331
02:04:26,120 --> 02:04:27,610
沒打中
Missed!

1332
02:04:42,910 --> 02:04:45,930
復仇號是我的了[同時意為復了仇]
The Revenge is mine.

1333
02:04:52,620 --> 02:04:54,080
先生
Sir...

1334
02:04:56,550 --> 02:04:58,420
我們在甲板下發現了這個
We found this below decks.

1335
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:26,780
全員  開往上風向
All hands! Ply to windward!

1336
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:30,480
動起來  你們這群蟑螂
Get cracking, ye blooming cockroaches!

1337
02:05:33,190 --> 02:05:35,780
國王是對我不錯
The Crown served me well.

1338
02:05:35,930 --> 02:05:38,920
但如今  大海藍天諸神在上
But now, by the gods of sea and sky...

1339
02:05:39,060 --> 02:05:43,160
向托爾圖加島開進吧
...make way for Tortuga!

1340
02:05:54,280 --> 02:05:57,440
吉布斯  你這骯髒糊塗的老東西居然成功了
Gibbs, you filthy, besotted shellback, you made it!

1341
02:05:57,580 --> 02:05:59,140
是的
Aye!

1342
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:00,880
我相信在這次的聯盟中
And I trust we managed a profit

1343
02:06:01,020 --> 02:06:05,180
-我們有所獲利  -請大飽眼福吧
- from our joint enterprise? - Feast your eyes.

1344
02:06:10,260 --> 02:06:12,790
指南針直接領我找到了它
The compass led me straight and true.

1345
02:06:12,930 --> 02:06:14,920
你怎麼對付黑鬍子船上的看守
What of Blackbeard's men guarding the ship?

1346
02:06:15,030 --> 02:06:18,930
我用了在新幾內亞大獲成功的那個辦法
I employed the selfsame maneuver we perfected in New Guinea.

1347
02:06:19,040 --> 02:06:23,130
如果留下一整只艦隊不拿就太可惜了
Seemed a shame to leave an entire fleet behind.

1348
02:06:23,270 --> 02:06:25,330
確實可惜
Shame indeed.

1349
02:06:37,290 --> 02:06:38,650
我恨那隻猴子
I hate that monkey.

1350
02:06:38,790 --> 02:06:42,230
黑珍珠號要怎麼弄出來
So, the Pearl... Any idea how to get her out?

1351
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:45,390
我們需要一把弩  一個沙漏  三隻山羊
We shall need a crossbow, an hourglass, three goats.

1352
02:06:45,530 --> 02:06:46,620
我們中的一個
One of us must learn to play

1353
02:06:46,620 --> 02:06:48,560
得學會吹小號  另一個得這樣
the trumpet whilst the other one goes like this...

1354
02:06:49,070 --> 02:06:52,370
-我認識個人有山羊  -很好  那我可以這樣
- I know a man with a goat. - Good. I can go like this.

1355
02:06:55,010 --> 02:06:56,670
傑克  我想問問
Jack, I have to ask...

1356
02:06:56,810 --> 02:06:59,670
你有了聖盃  泉水還有眼淚
You had the chalices, the water, the tear...

1357
02:06:59,810 --> 02:07:02,340
你大概能長命百歲
You could have lived maybe forever.

1358
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:04,450
不老泉會考驗你  吉布斯
The Fountain does test you, Gibbs.

1359
02:07:04,620 --> 02:07:07,520
但最好還是別知道何時是生命的盡頭
But better to not know which moment may be your last.

1360
02:07:07,650 --> 02:07:09,680
在生命中的每個瞬間
Every morsel of your entire being

1361
02:07:09,820 --> 02:07:12,910
都能感受到生命本身無限的奧秘
alive to the infinite mystery of it all.

1362
02:07:13,060 --> 02:07:15,580
再說  誰說我不會長命百歲
And who's to say I won't live forever, eh?

1363
02:07:15,730 --> 02:07:18,850
不老泉的發現者
Discoverer of the Fountain of Youth.

1364
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,900
這事我說不了算  吉布斯
I have no say in it, Gibbs.

1365
02:07:22,030 --> 02:07:24,020
我注定是個海盜
It's a pirate's life for me.

1366
02:07:24,970 --> 02:07:26,460
懂了嗎
Savvy?
