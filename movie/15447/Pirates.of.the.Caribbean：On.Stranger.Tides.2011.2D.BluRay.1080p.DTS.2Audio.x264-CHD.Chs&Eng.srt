4
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,460
你是谁
Who are you?

5
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,640
西班牙  加的斯  [西班牙港口城市]

6
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,640

00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,310
陛下  我们用渔网捞起了他  渔网
Your Majesty, caught him up in a fishing net. A fishing net.

8
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,390
大人  他有许多故事  那些故事...
Sire, he's been telling stories. Stories that...

9
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,460
我们相信他找到了

庞塞・德莱昂[西班牙探险家]
Ponce de Leon.

11
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,830
他说他找到了庞塞・德莱昂的船
Says he found Ponce de Leon's ship.

12
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,700
-还乘那船出海过  -不  我告诉过你
- Or sailed on it. - No, I told you,

13
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,140
庞塞・德莱昂死了两百多年了
Ponce de Leon died 200 years ago.

14
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,800
没错  可他终其一生在寻找什么吧
Aye, but he died searching for something, didn't he?

15
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,210
不老泉
The Fountain of Youth.

16
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,090
你何时能启航
How soon can you sail?

17
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,520
潮起之时
With the tide.

18
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,770
看一看瞧一瞧  幸运草
Over here! Lucky heather!

19
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,010
英国  伦敦

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,550
今日处决海盗  快去看呐
Pirate's execution today. Watch him swing!

22
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,550
海盗玩偶
Pirate puppets!

23
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,210
接招吧  小子
Take that, you!

24
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,190
快点  爸爸  要不就赶不及看绞刑了
Hurry, Papa, or we'll miss the hanging!

25
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,290
那不是绞刑  宝贝  那是审判
It's not a hanging, dear, it's a trial.

26
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,990
下午才行刑呢
The hanging comes this afternoon.

27
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,790
今日处决海盗

00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,530
快走  海盗
Move along, pirate.

30
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,070
是不是该叫你  "海盗船长"
Or should I say, "Captain Pirate"?

31
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,440
快点  快走
Come on. Come on! Up you go.

32
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,450
安静  肃静
Quiet! Order!

33
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,320
安静
Quiet!

34
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,920
传唤臭名昭著
Now appearing before the court,

35
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,290
声名狼藉的海盗  劫掠者
the notorious and infamous pirate, pillager,

36
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,820
-匪徒  -安静
- and highwayman... - Quiet!

37
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,650
杰克・史派罗船长上庭
...Captain Jack Sparrow!

38
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,430
我说过了  我叫吉布斯  约什米・吉布斯
I told you, the name's Gibbs! Joshamee Gibbs!

39
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,370
-我还要说多少...  -注意
- How many times... - Hear ye, hear ye!

40
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,830
全体起立  有请主持本次庭审
Presiding over these trials,

41
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:43,600
尊敬的史密斯法官大人
all rise and attend, the Right Honorable Justice Smith!

42
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,150
大人
My dear sir.

43
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,120
安静
Quiet!

44
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,690
现在
Now...

45
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,070
是什么情况
...what do we have here?

46
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,530
杰克
Jack?

47
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,160
闭嘴
Shut up!

48
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:11,970
我不认识他
I don't recognize him.

49
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,300
没这必要  你刚说什么
Not necessary. You were saying?

50
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,070
我不是杰克・史派罗
Jack Sparrow is not my name.

51
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,150
我是约什米・吉布斯
My name is Joshamee Gibbs.

52
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,010
是吗
Is that so?

53
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:25,180
-上面写着你是杰克・史派罗  -我说过了
- It says Jack Sparrow here. - I told 'em.

54
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,330
我不叫杰克・史派罗
I'm not Jack Sparrow,

55
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,480
但我很乐意向庭上指认他
who I would be happy to identify to the court

56
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,810
要是这能证明我的清白
if it would help my case.

57
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,520
我认为这辩护并不高明
I think that would be a poor defense,

58
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,360
除非你还想像头蠢海豹一样被打一下
unless you want to be bludgeoned again like a harp seal.

59
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,660
囚犯辩称自己不是杰克・史派罗
The prisoner claims of being innocent

60
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,200
你们陪审团以为如何
to being Jack Sparrow. How do you find?

61
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,060
没有庭审  可我们是来检验证据...
No trial? But aren't we here to examine the evidence...

62
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,730
团长  告诉我你的结论  有罪吗
Foreman, your finding. Guilty?

63
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,740
有罪裁断将处以绞刑
Guilty verdict means he'll hang.

64
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,570
吊死他  把他吊起来
Hang him! String him up!

65
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,370
-有罪吧  -这不公平
- Guilty? - That's not fair!

66
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,750
闭嘴
Shut it.

67
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,780
约什米・吉布斯  由于你并非杰克・史派罗
Joshamee Gibbs, the crime of which you've been found guilty of

68
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,690
所以你没有犯下他的罪行
is being innocent of being Jack Sparrow.

69
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,220
因此本庭赦免你的死刑
I hereby commute your sentence,

70
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,030
宣判你将被处以徒刑
and order that you be imprisoned for the remainder

71
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,030
在监狱里度过你那行尸走肉般的悲惨余生
of your miserable, moribund, mutton-chopped life.

72
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,100
-什么  -吊死他
- What?! - Hang him!

73
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,430
-吊死他  -闭庭
- Hang him! - There.

74
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,940
-胡说八道  -吊死他  把他吊起来
- Balderdash! - String him up! Hang him high!

75
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,240
法庭将安排将囚犯押至
Means shall be arranged to transport this prisoner

76
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,410
伦敦塔
to the Tower of London.

77
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,230
非常感谢
Thanks very much.

78
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,790
拜拜
Ta.

79
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,230
快点  给我上去
Come on. Get up there.

80
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,370
上去
Get up!

81
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,710
真见鬼  这下咱们俩都得进去了
Hell's teeth. Now we're both headed for prison.

82
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,520
别担心  我买通了车夫
Not to worry. I've paid off the driver.

83
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,060
用不了十分钟  咱们就出了伦敦城  有马等着
Ten minutes, we'll be outside London Town, horses waiting.

84
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,720
今晚  我们就能到海边
Tonight, we make the coast.

85
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,190
再然后就是弄艘船的问题了
Then it's just a matter of finding a ship.

86
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,130
-这都计划好了吗  -没错
- All part of the plan, yes? - Exactly.

87
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,200
我今早刚到伦敦城
I arrived in London Town just this morning

88
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,410
来救和绞刑架有个约会的
to rescue one Joshamee

89
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,500
名叫约什米・吉布斯的家伙
Gibbs from one appointment with the gallows.

90
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,440
鉴于你目前还活得好好的
Seeing as how you're still alive,

91
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,300
我认为目前为止还挺成功
I'd say it's all been very successful thus far.

92
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,170
你怎么了  吉布斯
What happened to you, Gibbs?

93
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,870
我以为你出海了或是在忙别的
I thought you were employed elsewhere or otherwise engaged.

94
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,390
没错  可我一直在
Aye. But I always listened

95
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,510
打探黑珍珠号的消息
like a thief for news of the Black Pearl.

96
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,120
谁也不知道她会停靠在何处
Nobody's seen where she might next make port.

97
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,310
后来  我听到流言
Then, I hear a rumor:

98
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,950
杰克・史派罗在伦敦找了条船  在招募水手
Jack Sparrow's in London with a ship and looking for a crew.

99
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,820
-才怪  -可我是这么听说
- Am not. - But that's what I heard.

100
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,190
说你今晚就在
Fact is, you're signing up men tonight.

101
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,860
"船长之女"酒吧招人
Pub called The Captain's Daughter.

102
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,230
-才怪  -我是觉得有点奇怪
- Am not! - Well, I thought it a bit odd,

103
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,100
不过话说回来  你做事总是这么不靠谱
but then, you've never been the most predictable of sorts.

104
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,240
跟我好好说说
Tell me something.

105
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,900
这儿还有个叫杰克・史派罗的家伙冒充我的大名
There is another Jack Sparrow out there sullying my good name?

106
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,210
-冒名的骗子  -没错
- An impostor. - Indeed.

107
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,110
不过  人家有船
But... an impostor with a ship.

108
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,810
还有水手
And in need of a crew.

109
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,980
这些  苍天在上  我也会有
Which, as fate would have it, so am I.

110
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,580
你怎么样  杰克
What about you, Jack?

111
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,590
我上回听说  你拼了老命要找那不老泉
Last I heard, you were hell-bent to find the Fountain of Youth.

112
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,250
运气如何
Any luck?

113
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,270
经历了千辛万苦后  我顿悟了
Circumstances arose and forced a compelling insight

114
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,410
此行既需要勇气  也得小心谨慎
regarding discretion and valor.

115
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,670
-那就是说  你放弃了  -我没有
- Meaning, you gave up. - I did not.

116
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,610
我还是一样不要命  妥妥的
I am just as bent as ever. Hellishly so.

117
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,580
我一定要尝尝那泉水  吉布斯水手长  我把话撂在这儿
I shall taste those waters, Master Gibbs. Mark my words.

118
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,380
真快
Short trip.

119
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,360
这也是计划好的吧
All part of the plan, yes?

120
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,560
不是
No.

121
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:34,050
你就是杰克・史派罗吗
You are Jack Sparrow?

122
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,790
你好像漏了"船长"二字
There should be a "Captain" In there somewhere.

123
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,460
我听过你
I've heard of you.

124
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,660
你一定知道我是谁
And you know who I am.

125
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,260
看起来挺面熟  我是不是恐吓过你
Face is familiar. Have I threatened you before?

126
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,710
在你面前的是乔治・奥古斯都
You are in the presence of George Augustus,

127
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,170
伯伦瑞克-吕纳堡公爵
Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg,

128
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,180
神圣罗马帝国的首要财务官和选帝侯
Archtreasurer and Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire,

129
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,710
大不列颠及爱尔兰的国王  也是你的国王
King of Great Britain and Ireland, and of you.

130
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,550
-还是没想起来  -我听说
- Doesn't ring a bell. - I am informed

131
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:04,150
你来伦敦是为了招募水手
you have come to London to procure a crew for your ship.

132
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,430
恶毒的流言  假的
Vicious rumor. Not true.

133
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,690
那你就是在谎称自己是杰克・史派罗
Then you lied to me when you told me you were Jack Sparrow.

134
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,060
我是杰克・史派罗  不过我来不是为了招水手
I am Jack Sparrow, but I'm not here to procure a crew.

135
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,630
那是...别人
That is... someone else.

136
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,330
别的叫杰克・史派罗的人
Someone else named Jack Sparrow.

137
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,240
你给我找错了人
You've brought me the wrong wastrel.

138
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,680
给我找来本人  把这个冒牌货处理掉
Find the proper one and dispose of this impostor.

139
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,870
不  等等  等会儿
No, wait, wait, wait. Hang on a minute.

140
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,420
我是杰克・史派罗  独一无二的
I'm Jack Sparrow, the one and only.

141
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,250
我就在伦敦
And I am in London.

142
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,450
你要招募水手
To procure a crew.

143
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,320
进行一场伟大的航行
To undertake a voyage

144
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,890
-目标是那什么泉...  -什么
- to the Fountain... - What?

145
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:43,590
谁来解开那些见鬼的锁链
Will someone please remove these infernal chains?

146
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,890
来来来
Come, come.

147
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,770
我们知道你有幅地图
We know you're in possession of a map.

148
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,070
那就没收那地图  然后送他上绞架
So confiscate the map, and to the gallows with him!

149
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,070
你有地图吗
Have you a map?

150
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,450
-没  -那在哪儿
- No. - Where is it?

151
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,280
说实话  我弄丢了
The truth? I lost it.

152
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,410
-实际上  就在前不久  -我收到消息
- Quite recently, in fact. - I have a report.

153
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,150
说西班牙人已知道了不老泉的所在
The Spanish have located the Fountain of Youth.

154
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:19,430
我可不能让可憎的西班牙国王
I will not have some melancholy Spanish monarch,

155
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:24,160
一个天主教徒  获得永生
a Catholic, gain eternal life!

156
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,710
你当真知道去不老泉的路
You do know the way to the Fountain?

157
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,970
当然  我可是杰克船长
Of course I do. Look at me.

158
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,980
你能领导我们的远征队
You could guide an expedition.

159
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,640
如果您允许  大大
With your permission, your heinie,

160
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,190
还提供一艘船
you will be providing, then, a ship...

161
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,450
和水手吗
...and a crew?

162
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,120
还有船长
And a captain.

163
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,970
午安  陛下
Afternoon, sire.

164
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,350
恕我冒昧  为什么没把那家伙铐起来
If I may be so bold, why is that man not in chains?

165
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,420
必须立即铐上他
He must be manacled at once.

166
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,150
在我这宫殿之中  没这必要
At the center of my palace? Hardly.

167
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,450
赫克托
Hector.

168
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,080
看到海盗老友从良了真好
How nice to see a fellow pirate make good of himself.

169
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,360
海盗  不  是私掠船长
Pirate? Nay. Privateer.

170
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,780
为捍卫王上的权威
On a sanctioned mission under

171
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,100
而被赋予此项使命
the authority and protection of the Crown.

172
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,700
就算是吧  不过首先
As may be, but first,

173
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,040
我亲爱的黑珍珠号哪去了
what has become of my beloved Pearl?

174
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,310
我失去了黑珍珠号  正如我这条腿
I lost the Pearl as I lost my leg.

175
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,710
-失去了什么意思  -是的
- Lost the Pearl? - Aye.

176
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,790
我曾奋勇守护她  可她终不能免于沉没
I defended her mightily enough, but she be sunk nonetheless.

177
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,880
船在人在  船亡人亡
If that ship be sunk properly, you should be sunk with it.

178
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,160
巴博萨船长  我们每耽搁一秒钟
Captain Barbossa, each second we tarry,

179
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,330
西班牙人都会多甩开我们一点
the Spanish outdistance us.

180
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,900
我非常相信  以你的热忱
I have every confidence you will prevail and be rewarded

181
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,370
你必将无往不胜  赢得我的奖赏
with the high station you so desire.

182
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:12,280
-愿尽绵薄之力  陛下  -你也太不要脸了
- To serve doth suffice, sire. - You, sir, have stooped.

183
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,750
杰克  咱俩的日子还长着呢
Jack, our sands be all but run.

184
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,220
识时务  方能成俊杰
Where's the harm in joining the winning side?

185
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,150
而你面前的我确实更有地位了
And you do meet a nicer class of person.

186
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,690
这我都能理解
I understand everything.

187
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,390
除了你那假发
Except that wig.

188
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,860
他要逃走了  抓住他
He's getting away! Stop him!

189
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,600
-拦住他  -不  拦住那个海盗
- Head him off! - No! Stop that pirate!

190
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,590
下来
Come down!

191
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,280
-他逃走了  -交给我吧  陛下
- He escaped? - Leave it to me, sire.

192
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,120
卫兵  卫兵
Guards! Guards!

193
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,380
-准备好武器  -遵命  大人
- Arms at ready! - Aye, sir!

194
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,910
找到他
Find him!

195
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,610
捡着就是我的
Finders keepers!

196
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,970
在那儿
There!

197
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,770
这就完事了
Is that it?

198
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,440
停下  拦下那辆马车
Halt! Stop that carriage!

199
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,870
截住他
Head him off!

200
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,520
让开
Out of the way!

201
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,550
抓住那个海盗
Stop that pirate!

202
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,250
都让开
Move out of the way!

203
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,220
抓住那个人
Stop that man!

204
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,890
别让他跑了
Don't let him get away!

205
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,140
开火
Fire!

206
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,770
他跑了  追上他  抓住他
He's getting away! After him! Stop him!

207
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,640
追上他
After him!

208
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,420
下贱的海盗
Filthy pirate.

209
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,670
你好  小杰
Hello, Jackie.

210
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,860
你好  老爸
Hello, Dad.

211
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,480
我听说你在招募水手
I heard you're putting together a crew.

212
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,490
流言传了一千遍  也就成了真
If enough people keep saying it, it must be true.

213
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,390
我知道你要去哪  不老泉
I heard where you're headed. The Fountain.

214
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,020
你去过吗
Have you been there?

215
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,190
你看我这张脸  像是去过不老泉的样子吗
Does this face look like it's been to the Fountain of Youth?

216
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,830
-光线问题  -儿子  不老泉
- Depends on the light. - Son, the Fountain.

217
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,800
需要一些特殊道具完成仪式
There'll be items required for the profane ritual.

218
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,570
两只圣杯
Two chalices.

219
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,740
-地图上是有个圣杯  -两只  银制的
- On the map there was a chalice. - Two, silver.

220
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,750
在庞塞・德莱昂的船上  你需要两只
From the Ponce de Leon ship. You'll need both.

221
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,510
-为什么  -完成仪式  别傻了  小杰
- For? - The ritual. Don't be a fool, Jackie.

222
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,710
做好完全的准备  再起航
Find out every detail before you set sail.

223
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,720
启航  那很好
Oh, set sail. Love to.

224
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,090
可我得有艘船才行
But for that, I may need a ship.

225
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,530
那边的那些家伙  他们有船
Those folk, over there, they have a ship.

226
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,220
他们现在就在招水手
They're signing up sailors right now.

227
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,560
我的心被丘比特射中
My heart is pierced by Cupid

228
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,690
我对金子也不屑一顾
I disdain all glittering gold

229
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,200
最后一件事  小杰
And one last thing, Jackie.

230
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,910
不老泉会考验你  记住我的话
The Fountain will test you. Mark my words.

231
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,380
我的心被丘比特射中
My heart is pierced by Cupid

232
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,450
我对金子也不屑一顾
I disdain all glittering gold

233
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,310
只有快乐勇敢的水手
There is nothing can console me

234
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,080
能让我的心得到慰藉
But my jolly sailor bold

235
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,430
我听说你们在招水手
I hear you be recruiting a crew.

236
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,630
是的
Aye. That is,

237
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:47,570
杰克・史派罗正在准备一场探险
Jack Sparrow be putting together a modest venture.

238
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,640
你有点神经兮兮的呀
You got some nerve, ain't ya?

239
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,300
穿成这副模样
Turning up here dressed like that?

240
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,440
你算哪根葱  冒名顶替的吗
What are you, some kind of impostor?

241
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,780
你知道我是谁吗  朋友
Have you any idea who I am, mate?

242
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,590
喂  哥儿几个
Oi, muckers!

243
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,320
这儿有个哥们连自己是谁都想不起来
There's a bloke here what's forgotten his own name!

244
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,360
大伙儿  我要和史派罗一起出海了
Lads, I'm sailing with Sparrow.

245
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,290
谁来给水手买杯酒喝
Who'll buy a sailor a drink?

246
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,920
下一位
Who's next?

247
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,440
再来一点
Bring us some more of those ones.

248
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,780
对  再来四个
Yeah, make it four.

249
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:41,350
你偷了我的身份  我来要回我自己
You've stolen me, and I'm here to take meself back.

250
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,160
别学我
Stop doing that.

251
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,120
只有一个人会那招
Only one person alive knows that move.

252
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,990
早就想这么干了
Always wanted to do that.

253
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,730
你好  安琪莉卡
Hello, Angelica.

254
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:10,010
你好  杰克  没想到吧
Hello, Jack. Are you impressed?

255
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,340
我想有那么一两次  我差点就能杀了你
I think I almost killed you once or twice there.

256
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,540
你这真挚的赞扬让我分外感动
I'm touched at this most sincerest form of flattery.

257
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,220
可这是为什么
But why?

258
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,020
你是唯一一个我能装得像的海盗
You were the only pirate I thought I would pass for.

259
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,890
这可不是什么好话
That is not a compliment.

260
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,990
别担心  杰克  我早就原谅你了
Don't worry, Jack. I forgave you a long time ago.

261
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:37,300
-原谅什么  我甩了你  -好好想想  是我甩的你
- For what? For leaving you? - Recall that I left you.

262
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,340
绅士总得纵容女士沉溺在她的小幻想中
A gentleman allows a lady to maintain her fictions.

263
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,000
听着  史派罗  只要我的水手有钱可赚
Look, Sparrow. As long as my sailors get their money,

264
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,170
不管是什么样的事情  他们都能凑合
they're willing to put up with any number of peculiarities.

265
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,010
有那么一件事情  我可凑合不了
There is one peculiarity with which I will not put up with.

266
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,710
我来演船长  必须这样
I will be impersonated as "Captain." Nothing less.

267
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,880
要想当船长  你得先有艘船
Well, for that, you need a ship,

268
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,520
而我  恰恰就有一艘
and as it turns out, I have one.

269
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,400
我正好需要一艘船
I could use a ship.

270
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:07,260
我听说你去过那里
I hear tell you've been to the Fountain.

271
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,560
最近小道消息真不少
There be a lot of hear-telling going on these days.

272
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:14,230
-不老泉  -亲爱的安琪莉卡  别担心
- The Fountain of Youth.  - Dearest Angelica, fret not.

273
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,140
你还年轻
You still have a few usable years left.

274
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,610
真会讲话
Always so charming.

275
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,870
你没回答我
You didn't answer me.

276
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,580
哦对  至于不老泉  那是浪费时间  真的...
Aye. Regarding the Fountain. Waste of time, really...

277
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,170
夫人  发现一群可疑的人
Milady, I see unseamanlike

278
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,350
不像船员  像是来找茬儿的
fellows of an officious-looking nature.

279
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,150
无耻的海盗  抓住他们  这帮无赖
Wretched pirates! Find 'em! Maggots!

280
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,520
你的朋友吗
Friends of yours?

281
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,290
我可能不小心惹火了国王之类的人
I may have unintentionally slighted some king or other.

282
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,230
打开
Open it!

283
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:44,030
-你还是没变  -能给点提示吗
- Yeah, you haven't changed.  - Implying the need?

284
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,540
那好
Yes.

285
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,370
打开门  这是国王的命令
Open this door, in the name of His Majesty.

286
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,870
你背叛了我  还引诱和利用我
You betrayed me. You seduced me and you used me.

287
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,740
骗术什么的我本来并不擅长
I was innocent of the ways of men.

288
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,060
就一个我要带坏的人来说
You demonstrated a lot of

289
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,180
你有点过于强大了
technique for someone I supposedly corrupted.

290
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,080
太危险了  快点  夫人
Imminent danger. Here, now, milady!

291
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,850
打开
Open it!

292
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,550
我正要宣誓  你却...
I was ready to take my vows. And you...

293
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,320
你究竟怎么会出现在西班牙的女修道院
What were you doing in a Spanish convent, anyway?

294
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,220
把那当妓院了  纯属失误
Mistook it for a brothel. Honest mistake.

295
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,790
-他在那  -那边
- There he is!  - Over there!

296
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,150
我们的处境很被动
We are at a disadvantage.

297
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,690
那是你  我可不像某人装成别人
Speak for yourself. Unlike some who pretend to be,

298
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,620
实际上连人家一根毛都及不上
but cannot, in fact, hold a candle to,

299
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,230
我才是杰克・史派罗船长
I am Captain Jack Sparrow.

300
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,990
你怎么能说我利用你
How can you say I used you?

301
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,330
你明明知道
You know exactly how.

302
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,600
我知道  但你怎么能说出口
I know, but how can you say it?

303
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,740
-那到底是什么  -什么是什么
- So, what is it?  - What is what?

304
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,410
不老泉
About the Fountain.

305
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,050
你知道什么
What do you know?

306
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,620
庞塞・德莱昂的两个圣杯
You don't happen to be in possession

307
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,990
不会就刚好在你这吧
of two silver chalices, circa Ponce de Leon?

308
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,560
-没有  -我想也是
- No.  - Thought not.

309
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,330
-怎么  -我听到有些说法
- Why?  - I hear stories.

310
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,300
传言
Rumors.

311
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,570
你肯定知道仪式吧
You are, of course, aware of the ritual.

312
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,630
是的
Yes, I am.

313
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,710
是什么样的  需要什么道具
What is it? What is required?

314
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,310
一条美人鱼  杰克
A mermaid, Jack.

315
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,690
一定是搞错了
There's been a mistake.

316
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:26,360
我是被判无期徒刑  不是死刑
It's a life sentence, not death. Life!

317
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,100
-巴博萨  -谢谢  先生们
- Barbossa.  - Thank you, gentlemen.

318
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,230
我相信你会系绳索
I trust you can tie a noose.

319
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,780
这是强人所难
That's a hard thing,

320
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,910
让人给自己绑绞绳
forcing a man to twist his own hanging rope.

321
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,580
这叫自作自受
You must lie in your bed the way you made it.

322
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,790
你们俩怎么了
What's happened to you?

323
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,360
-杰克・史派罗呢  -他跑了
- Where be Jack Sparrow?  - He escaped.

324
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,930
我很赶时间  吉布斯
I'm on a tight schedule, Gibbs.

325
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,430
皇家海军明晨就要出发
The HMS Providence sets sail at first light.

326
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,730
如果你不想死后满嘴苍蝇
If you do not care to watch it hanging here dead,

327
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,890
还被挂在这里示众
with a mouth full of flies...

328
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,160
就赶快招了
...speak now.

329
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,400
带上我  罗盘上的所有地点...
Take me with you. Any point of the compass...

330
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:14,380
带你去哪  吉布斯  不老泉吗
Take you where, Gibbs? The Fountain? Aye?

331
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,510
杰克也要去那儿吗
Is that where Jack be headed?

332
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,710
你能给我什么  吉布斯
Have you anything you can offer me, Gibbs?

333
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,380
有吗
Anything at all?

334
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,650
说白了  你见不到黎明了
Upon me naked word, you'll not see the dawn.

335
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,430
把它给我
Hand it over.

336
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,470
-你个蠢货  -我有足够时间
- You fool!  - I had just enough time

337
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:48,100
好好研究了下那张地图
to study those infernal circles.

338
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:52,880
所有路线和目的地  全都牢牢记在这了
Every route, every destination. All safe... in here.

339
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:58,410
欢迎回到皇家海军  吉布斯水手长
Welcome back to His Majesty's navy, Master Gibbs.

340
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
起床  水手
Show a leg, sailor!

341
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,870
遵命  长官
Aye, sir.

342
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,710
啥
What?

343
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,040
-这是个天大的误会  -继续走
- There's been a horrible mistake.  - Keep moving.

344
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,520
-我不该在这  -许多人在海上醒来
- I'm not supposed to be here.  - Many a man's woken up at sea,

345
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,590
大脑一片空白
no idea what, when, wherefore or why.

346
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,980
完全不记得前天晚上是在哪签的协议
No memory of the night afore, whence he signed up

347
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,650
又是在哪把佣金全部买了酒喝
and drank away all his bonus money.

348
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,780
不  不  不  你不明白  伙计 
No, no, no. You don't understand, mate.

349
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,330
我是杰克・史派罗船长  如假包换  独一无二
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow. The original. The only.

350
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,020
我叫史考姆  很高兴认识你  好了  走吧
Scrum, and the pleasure's all mine. Now, keep moving.

351
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,010
史考姆
Scrum.

352
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,370
过来
Get your elbows in!

353
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,750
这怎么有一口玻璃棺材
Why is there a glass coffin?

354
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,350
我看起来像是管事儿的吗
Do I look like a man in charge?

355
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,420
-这是哪儿  -不好意思  史派罗船长
- Where am I?   - 'Scuse me, Captain Sparrow, sir.

356
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,220
我很荣幸地欢迎您登上这艘
I be right honored to welcome you aboard

357
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,620
臭名昭著的安娜王后复仇号
our world-renowned vessel of infamy, Queen Anne's Revenge.

358
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,690
黑胡子
Blackbeard.

359
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,910
干活儿
Work!

360
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,450
-这人挺古怪  -他是还魂尸
- He's a curious one.  - He's been zombiefied.

361
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,450
加勒比海一些部族的宗教信仰  被巫术驱动的死尸

362
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,250
还魂尸
Zombiefied.

363
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:43,890
黑胡子干的  管事儿的都是
Blackbeard's doing. All the officers are the same.

364
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,760
这样的人更服从命令
Makes 'em more compliant.

365
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,000
还有没完没了的坏脾气
And perpetually ill-tempered.

366
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,300
-快擦  -好
- Come on. Scrub.  - Yeah.

367
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:04,010
拉  拉  拉
Pull! Pull! Pull!

368
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,110
我们航行了至少五天
Five days underway, at least.

369
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,090
是啊  你是根据海的味道辨别的吗
Aye. You can tell that by the smell of the sea?

370
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,960
船员的味道
Smell of the crew.

371
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,630
那个可怜鬼做了什么
Oi. What did that poor sod do?

372
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,800
我怎么保证不重蹈覆辙
And how can I make sure to not?

373
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,270
他吗  是个牧师
Him? Churchly fellow.

374
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,430
总是宣扬上帝万能
Always going on about the Lord Almighty.

375
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,310
船上还有讲《圣经》的牧师
Bible-thumper on this ship?

376
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,350
用他的话说是传教士
A missionary is his story.

377
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,240
我听说他在一次突袭中被逮住
What I heard was he got captured in a raid.

378
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:40,250
船上其他人都死了  除了他
Rest of the ship got killed, but not 'im.

379
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,680
因为他的虔诚信仰
First mate wouldn't let it happen

380
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,520
大副放过了他
on account of his premier standing with the Lord.

381
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,060
大副她为了这人冒了很大风险
A first mate sticking her neck out for some prisoner.

382
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,820
你能想到吗
That you don't see.

383
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,660
她?  大副是女的?
"Her"? First mate is a "Her"?

384
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,030
回去干活儿
Back to work!

385
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,610
船速很稳定
Steady as she goes.

386
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:25,200
你个残忍  没良心  遭报应的卑鄙小人
You are a ruthless, soulless, cross-grained cur.

387
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,820
-我跟你说过我有条船  -不对  是黑胡子的船
- I told you I had a ship.  - No, Blackbeard has a ship,

388
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,770
而我就被囚禁在这条船上
upon which I am now imprisoned.

389
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,910
我们可以联手  杰克
We can do this, Jack.

390
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:38,640
不老泉  你一直都想去
The Fountain of Youth, like you always wanted.

391
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:43,880
黑胡子  爱德华・提奇  所有海盗都惧怕的海盗
Blackbeard. Edward Teach. The pirate all pirates fear.

392
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,180
没事儿喜欢给尸体还魂
Resurrector of the dead in his spare time.

393
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,190
-他会听我的话  -他不听任何人
- He will listen to me.  - He listens to no one.

394
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,220
连他女儿也不听吗
Maybe to his own daughter?

395
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,700
女儿  亲生的吗
Daughter as in... beget by?

396
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,400
多年失散  最近团聚
Long-lost. Recently found.

397
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,370
她全心全意爱着她的父亲
Who loves her dear papa with all her soul.

398
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,570
-他居然信了  -凭我的三寸不烂之舌
- He bought that?  - I sold that.

399
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,810
那么想去不老泉的是他
Then it's the Fountain of Youth for him,

400
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,820
或者你和他  但不是你和我
or him and you, not you and me.

401
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,050
错了  杰克  最妙的来了
No, Jack, that's the best part.

402
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,250
他会死
He will be dead.

403
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,960
那你就能独吞了
You'll be handling that part yourself, then?

404
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,360
有个预言
There is a prophecy.

405
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,690
或许你不相信神奇力量
Maybe you don't believe in the supernatural.

406
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,290
不  不  不  我也见过几次
Oh, no, no. I've seen a thing or two.

407
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:42,830
预言就是
The prophecy is this:

408
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:46,810
黑胡子在两星期内
Blackbeard will meet his death within a fortnight

409
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:50,400
会死于一个独腿男人手中
at the hands of a one-legged man.

410
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,750
所以他要找不老泉  杰克
That's why he needs the Fountain, Jack.

411
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:11,830
吉布斯水手长  我们少张海图
Master Gibbs, short we are a map.

412
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,070
或许你该给我们指个方向
Perhaps you'd be so kind as to provide us an heading.

413
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,940
你能行行好  给我来点酒吗
Be a gem and pour me a gulper.

414
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,520
不  我们不是海盗  这是条私掠船  吉布斯水手长
Nay. We be privateers, not pirates, Master Gibbs.

415
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,780
看在国王的名义上  我们就得这样
And in the king's name, we behave as such.

416
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,750
是  船长
Aye, Captain.

417
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,960
我们的航线对吗  吉布斯
Be we on the proper course, Gibbs?

418
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:40,690
没错  不信看那边
Aye, it be proper. There's your proof.

419
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,500
西班牙人
The Spaniard.

420
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,810
全体船员  到战斗岗位  到上风向
All hands! Battle stations! Get to windward!

421
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:58,010
-全体船员  上风向  -帆向上拉紧两个点
- All hands, windward!  - Harden up two points!

422
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:01,590
-两个点  -解开炮索
- Two points!  - Cast loose the cannons!

423
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,320
-炮手就位  -就位  炮手准备完毕 船长
- Gunners, take posts!  - Take position! Gunners ready, sir!

424
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,330
-准备发射  -待命
- Out! Thrust!  - Await orders.

425
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,800
稳住
Steady!

426
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,730
大炮准备完毕  等待指示  船长
Guns armed, awaiting orders, sir.

427
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:29,070
船长  下命令吗  船长
Sir. Orders, sir?

428
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,420
他根本没在意我们
He never so much as turned his head.

429
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,420
不老泉才是目标
The Fountain is the prize.

430
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,190
看来他们不屑于袭击我们
It appears we be not even worth the time it'd take to sink us.

431
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:48,230
现在我们落后了  全员  快速前进
And now we've fallen behind. All hands, make more sail!

432
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,930
全员  加速前进
All hands, more sail!

433
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:54,400
加速前进  迎着风浪向前
Ride hard between wind and tide!

434
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,980
先生们  我们的话题是  夺权
The topic, gentlemen, is mutiny.

435
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,550
叛乱
Mutiny most foul.

436
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:14,220
没错  我是要为杰克・史派罗效力  不是什么冒牌货
Aye. I signed up to sail under Jack Sparrow, not some pretender.

437
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,620
更何况还是个女人
And a lady, at that.

438
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,960
还不知道船上都是些可怕的神奇生物
And mention was failed to be made of this uncanny crew.

439
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,460
他们弄弯了我的脚趾
Make my toes curl, they do.

440
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,660
所有的我都弄来了
I got 'em. All of them.

441
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,770
-干得好  -好小子
- Well done.  - Good lad.

442
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,340
还有一点  黑胡子
On to it, then. Blackbeard.

443
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,940
-他有什么习惯  -大多待在他房间里
- What are his habits?  - Stays mostly to his cabin.

444
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,880
是的  基本不出来
That's right, mostly to his cabin.

445
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,210
-对  但他一旦出来  -他没出来过
- Yes, but when he comes out...  - He don't really come out.

446
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,550
他肯定会出来
He must come out sometime.

447
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,620
从没露面过  没有
Not really, no.

448
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,150
你们中有谁和他出过海吗
Any of you sail with him before?

449
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,760
-没有  没有  -从来没有
- No, no.  - I've never.

450
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:49,920
绝对没有
Definitely not.

451
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,930
-你们有人见过他吗  -没有
- Any of you seen him before?  - Not really, no.

452
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,700
他待在房间里  没人和他出过海
Stays to his cabin, no one sailed with him,

453
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,900
没人见过他
no one's seen him...

454
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:03,040
好消息  先生们  这不是黑胡子的船
Good news, gentlemen. This is not Blackbeard's ship.

455
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,010
这不是安娜王后复仇号
This is not the Queen Anne's Revenge.

456
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,170
不  这是安娜王后复仇号  千真万确
No, this be the Queen Anne's Revenge, right enough.

457
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,780
你怎么知道
How do you know?

458
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:12,180
我见过船尾的船名
I've seen the name, on the back of the ship.

459
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:20,380
先生们  我的难兄难弟们
Gentlemen, sirs, fellow conscriptees...

460
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,260
你们被彻头彻尾地骗了
...you have been monstrously deceived.

461
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,530
-我们被骗了  -是的
- We are decepted, then?  - Yes.

462
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,600
他们从没告诉过你们目的地
You've nay been informed of a destination.

463
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,870
死亡正等着我们
Death lies before us

464
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:38,840
因为我们要开往不老泉
as we sail for the Fountain of Youth.

465
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,340
这下我们就惨了  兄弟们
It would be a sorry plight, mates.

466
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,610
-死亡  毫无疑问  -那里是恶灵的殿堂
- Death, for certain.  - The garden of darkened souls.

467
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,090
-我们活不了多久了  -除非
- Untimely our ends will be.  - Unless...

468
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,750
我们要占领这条船
...we take the ship.

469
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,620
那就这么干吧  就现在
We take the ship, then. Now!

470
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:03,360
去啊
Go on, then.

471
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,760
-来帮忙  水手们  -给他们
- Help me, shipmates!  - Give it to 'em!

472
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,170
-醒醒  船是我们的了  -来吧
- Wake up! It's ours!  - Come on!

473
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,970
起来  起来
Get up! Off your backside!

474
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,880
-别黏糊了  -分给他们  小子
- Get off your fannies!  - Take it to them, lads!

475
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,850
帮我  反抗
Help me! Fight!

476
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,800
杰克
Jack.

477
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:38,060
如果我在做梦  你带着剑穿着靴子也无妨
If this is a dream, you can keep the sword and boots on.

478
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,730
-如果不是  -你在做梦
- If it's not...  - It's a dream.

479
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,410
不  不是
No, it's not!

480
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,280
我想我该提醒你下  我们要占领这艘船
I thought I should give you fair warning, we're taking the ship.

481
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,810
不是针对你
Nothing personal.

482
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,790
我觉得这样对你有好处
Think you might be better off if you just...

483
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,760
如果你能别管这事的话
...stay out of it.

484
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,650
丑八怪
Boggit.

485
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,540
混蛋
Wretch!

486
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:21,160
你是敌是友
You're either with us or against us!

487
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,500
非敌非友
I am not with you, neither am I against you!

488
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,010
这不是自相矛盾吗
Can he do that?

489
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,170
他信教  信教的人都这样
He's religious. I believe it's required.

490
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:36,820
受死吧  你们这帮笨头笨脑的蠢货
Fight to the bitter end, you cack-handed deck apes!

491
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,030
抓住他  弟兄们  绑紧他
Take him, men. Tie him down tight!

492
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,510
船是我们的了
The ship is ours!

493
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,580
先生们
Gentlemen.

494
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,520
你们让我很困惑
I be placed in a bewilderment.

495
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:54,290
我正在里面休息
There I were, resting,

496
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:59,100
突然听到甲板上传来不和谐的吵闹声
and upon a sudden, I hear an ungodly row on deck.

497
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:04,110
水手们擅离职守
Sailors abandon their posts

498
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,770
无故缺勤
without orders, without leave.

499
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,110
桅杆前的兄弟
Men before the mast,

500
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,650
想把船据为己有
taking the ship for themselves.

501
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,690
怎么回事  大副
What be that, First Mate?

502
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,690
-有人叛乱  船长  -什么
- Mutiny, Captain.  - Again?

503
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,830
-叛乱  -明白了
- Mutiny!  - Aye.

504
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,090
叛乱
Mutiny.

505
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,040
那叛乱者的下场是什么
And what fate befalls mutineers?

506
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,700
我们知道该怎么做吧
Now, we know the answer to that, do we not?

507
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:39,440
把叛乱者都吊起来
Mutineers hang!

508
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,990
船长  我想举报一场叛乱
Captain, I wish to report a mutiny.

509
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,090
我能指名道姓
I can name fingers and point names.

510
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:35,730
不需要  史派罗先生
No need, Mr. Sparrow.

511
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:39,100
他们是羊群  而你  是牧羊人
They are sheep. You, their shepherd.

512
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:46,710
我有说过吗  船长  你女儿是个美女
Have I mentioned, sir, what a lovely daughter you have?

513
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:49,780
你小子死前还挺有眼福
A fitting last sight for a doomed soul.

514
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:52,350
等等  父亲  我们需要他
Remember, Father. We need him.

515
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,970
如果我不时常杀个人
If I don't kill a man every now and then,

516
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,520
-他们会忘了我是谁  -懦夫
- they forget who I am.  - Coward!

517
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,390
他们不会忘
They do not forget.

518
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:02,860
你的船员们把你看做恶魔
Your crew sees you for the miscreant you are.

519
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,330
无论你杀多少人  你都是个懦夫
A coward, no matter how many you slay.

520
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:07,870
一天之中  我两次感到困惑
Twice in one day, I find myself in a bewilderment.

521
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,130
你不是困惑  你是恐惧
You are not bewildered, you are afraid.

522
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,580
你不敢走正义之路
You dare not walk the

523
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,130
光明之路
path of righteousness, the way of the light.

524
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:17,540
不  牧师  事实比这简单得多
No, sir. The truth is it be much simpler than all that.

525
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,580
-我就是个坏人  -没错
- I am a bad man.  - That, too.

526
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,700
我也能杀了你  传教士
I might have to kill you too, catechist.

527
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:25,440
-不  -就跟她老妈一个样
- No!  - All Latin blood like her mother.

528
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,680
父亲  我求求你
Father, I beg you.

529
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:31,550
我又忘了这传教士为什么还活着了
There I be again, forgetting why the missionary is here.

530
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:36,090
我女儿担心我的灵魂  或是我剩下的灵魂
My daughter fears for my soul, or what's left of it.

531
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,760
你真想救赎我吗  孩子
You truly wish to save me, my child?

532
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,830
所有灵魂都能被救赎
Every soul can be saved.

533
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,770
真的吗  年轻的牧师
Be that true, young cleric?

534
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,600
是的  虽然我觉得你的希望渺茫
Yes. Though you I see as a bit of a long shot.

535
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:51,990
不过  我仍然为
Still, I pray for every

536
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:54,570
这艘地狱之船上所有不幸的灵魂祈祷
unfortunate soul on this hell-bound vessel.

537
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,780
你的信念让我放下武器
You disarm me with your faith.

538
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,620
八击钟
Eight bells!

539
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,750
刚才是哪个倒霉鬼在放哨
Which of you unfortunate souls stood watch?

540
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:10,850
-是我  我在放哨  -炮手
- I did. I stood watch. - Gunner.

541
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,630
你
You?

542
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,930
是的
Aye.

543
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:22,270
是的
Aye.

544
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:24,400
厨子
The cook.

545
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:27,410
非常好  放下大艇
Perfect. Lower the longboat!

546
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:34,640
亮出大炮
Bring her about!

547
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,440
为什么要这样  
Why do you do this?

548
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,220
这是叛变  规矩必须遵守
Mutiny. Our laws be clear.

549
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,670
规矩允许船长网开一面
Our laws allow the Captain to show leniency.

550
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,430
我给了他决定自己命运的机会
I have given this man a chance to determine his fate,

551
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,240
这可不是人人都能有的
a gift not afforded to all.

552
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:06,820
喂  你
Oh, you now.

553
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,710
现在来瞧瞧你的祈祷有没有用
Chance to show the worth of your prayers.

554
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:14,920
祈祷他从魔鬼手中得到...拯救
Pray he be delivered from... evil?

555
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,600
发射
Course made!

556
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:26,600
住手  给他个机会  给你自己...
Stop. Give that man a chance. Give yourself a...

557
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:54,930
知道我什么时候觉得最接近造物主吗
You know when I feel closest to our Maker?

558
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:56,930
当我看到苦难  伤痛和苦恼
When I see suffering, pain and anguish.

559
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:59,590
世界的真实面貌就会显现
That's when the true design of this world is revealed.

560
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:03,440
当苦难和悲剧发生之时
And I see it revealed when in times of hardship and tragedy,

561
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,870
需要的人会得到善意和同情
kindness and compassion are shown to those in need.

562
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:08,410
也许你该祈祷他不受伤害  对吧
Perhaps you should pray for him to be unharmed, yes?

563
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:10,740
-求求你  还有希望  -再来一次
- Please, there's still hope... - Again!

564
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,060
其实我对不老泉没半点兴趣
I actually have no interest in the Fountain whatsoever,

565
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,060
所以  如果你决心已定
so, if your heart is set,

566
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,400
可以随便把我扔在哪
you may drop me off anywhere you like.

567
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,300
可以了  舵手
That'll be all, Quartermaster.

568
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:38,800
你的花言巧语让人很难看清你的真面目
Your words surround you like fog and make you hard to see.

569
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,780
那你呢  了不起的黑胡子
And what of you, the mighty Blackbeard?

570
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,680
他们说你被砍了头  但是身体
Beheaded they say. Still, your body swam

571
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:49,290
绕船游了三圈  又回到船上
three times around your ship, then climbed back onboard.

572
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,020
而你现在  用恐惧震慑人心
And here you are, running scared.

573
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:56,090
-恐惧  -所以你要去不老泉
- Scared. - To the Fountain.

574
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:59,250
舵手可以预见未来
The Quartermaster sees things before they happen.

575
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,890
他预见了我的死亡  命运已经决定
He has foreseen my death, and so the fates have spoken.

576
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,370
命运之网已经张开
The threads of destiny woven.

577
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,470
你对命运的关注太荒谬了  伙计
You have a ridiculously high regard for fate, mate.

578
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:11,240
-你呢  -我
- And you? - Me?

579
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:15,640
我对所有预言都持怀疑态度  包括我的
I'm skeptical of predicting any future... which includes me.

580
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,330
和命运抗争是愚蠢的
It'd be foolish to battle fate,

581
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:21,580
不过我想要愚弄它
but I'd be tempted to cheat it.

582
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:24,590
我会到达不老泉  而你会带我去
I will reach the Fountain. You will lead me.

583
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:31,020
除了叛变  那把刀已经没更大用处了
That knife will serve you no better than the mutiny you devised.

584
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,960
叛变很成功
Mutiny served me well.

585
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,030
给我赢得了谒见你的机会
It gained me an audience with you.

586
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,260
是的
Aye.

587
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:41,470
来警告你
To warn you.

588
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,000
关于你的大副
Regarding your first mate,

589
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:47,040
她谎报了自己的真实身份
who pretends to be persons she is not.

590
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:48,670
继续说
Do tell.

591
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,050
她不是你的女儿
She is not your daughter.

592
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,380
你怎么敢这么说我的血脉
You dare to speak thusly of my flesh and blood?

593
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,050
先生  这女人精通骗术
Sir, the woman is consummate in the art of deception.

594
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,430
我知道  
I know.

595
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,660
是我不小心将她送上了邪路
As I mostly unwittingly set her on her wicked path.

596
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,730
当然也不能否认
Though I cannot claim credit

597
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:13,840
她极有天分
for her existing abundance of natural talent.

598
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,330
安琪莉卡  我亲爱的女儿
Angelica. My beloved daughter,

599
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,070
我这辈子干的唯一一件好事
the one true good thing I have done in this life,

600
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:23,880
你却声称自己把她毁了
and you claim to be the one who corrupted her?

601
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:28,040
先生  她是纯粹的魔鬼
Sir, what she is is pure evil.

602
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,590
比野兽还要可怕
More to be feared than a wild beast.

603
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,560
咬牙切齿的饥饿野兽
Hungry wild beast with gnashing teeth.

604
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:36,720
充满仇恨  地狱般饥渴  野兽...
Vengeful, hungry from hell, beast...

605
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,020
-父亲  -宝贝
- Father? - Sweetness!

606
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:42,520
你不用伤害他  父亲
No need to hurt him, Father.

607
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:45,900
他会帮我们  对吧  杰克
He will help us. Won't you, Jack?

608
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,770
你看  即使是现在  她也惦记着你
You see? Even now, she attends to your welfare,

609
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:53,470
即使你在这编造谎言挑拨离间
giving lie to the claims you make of her.

610
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:05,550
你会带我们去不老泉吧
You will lead us to the Fountain. Yes?

611
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,050
换种说法
Put another way.

612
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:12,260
如果我不能按时到达不老泉
If I do not make it to the Fountain in time...

613
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,890
那你也别想活命
neither will you.

614
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,490
我马上
I'll have a wee look-see

615
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,170
去看一眼海图  行吗
at those charts straight away then, shall I?

616
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:28,170
先生
Sir.

617
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:33,420
-什么事  -船长
- Aye? - Captain, sir,

618
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:35,950
我很不情愿地向您汇报  长官
I am unhappy to report rumors, sir,

619
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:38,280
关于我们的目的地  船员之间有了谣言
among the crew, as to our destination.

620
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,450
闭嘴  走开
Shut your trap and make way.

621
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:49,090
-我叫你走开  -没有不敬的意思  长官
- That's the way of it, then. - No disrespect, sir.

622
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,730
他们怕什么  说出来  告诉我
What do the men fear? Say it. Speak the words.

623
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:54,800
白浪湾
Whitecap Bay.

624
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:58,070
好吧  白浪湾
Aye, Whitecap Bay.

625
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:01,330
没用的水手都害怕这个名字
And every worthless seaman fears the name,

626
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:02,170
自然而然
and rightly so,

627
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:04,780
但没人知道为什么  也没人敢问
though few know why or dare to ask.

628
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,540
传说是真的吗
Be the stories true?

629
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,520
说说是什么让你这么心惊胆战  吉布斯
Say what robs you of your staunch heart, Gibbs,

630
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:11,820
不然的话就别危言耸听
or forever leave it to the wider fields of fancy.

631
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:16,120
美人鱼  船长
Mermaids, Captain.

632
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,020
对  美人鱼
Aye. Mermaids.

633
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,330
食尸鬼  魔鬼鱼  迫切渴望着人肉
Sea ghouls, devil fish, dreadful in hunger for flesh of man.

634
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:26,030
美人鱼的地盘  是我们的必经之路
Mermaid waters, that be our path.

635
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:27,760
坚守你的灵魂  吉布斯
Cling to your soul, Gibbs,

636
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:31,540
因为美人鱼会将灵魂以外的东西
as mermaids be given to take the rest...

637
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,110
吃干抹净
to the bone.

638
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:37,810
稳住  稳住  鼓起勇气
Steady! Steady, men! Find your courage,

639
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,850
不然就准备屈服于恐惧吧
or be ready to purpose your fear!

640
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,390
快逃命吧
Save yourselves!

641
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,820
-有人落水了  -不  是个逃兵
- Man overboard! - Nay! A deserter.

642
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,720
-改变航向  -不
- Come about. - Nay!

643
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,830
先生们  我不再问任何人
Gentlemen, I shall not ask any more of any man than what

644
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:56,460
他能怎么样
that man can deliver,

645
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:59,460
我只想问  难道我们不是国王的子民吗
but I do ask this: Are we not king's men?

646
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:01,040
是
Aye.

647
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:03,940
-执行国王的任务  -是
- On the king's mission? - Aye.

648
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:05,660
西班牙人经过我们的时候
I did not note any fear in

649
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:08,340
在他们眼里可没有任何恐惧
the eyes of the Spanish as they passed us by.

650
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,210
-难道我们不是国王的子民吗  -是
- Are we not king's men? - Aye!

651
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:14,280
这就对了  坚守岗位  打起精神
Aye! Hands all off, and bear away!

652
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:17,390
一往无前  直奔白浪湾
Stave on ahead to Whitecap Bay!

653
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,390
继续前进  白浪湾
Bear on, Whitecap Bay!

654
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:36,860
过来
Come.

655
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:38,310
来点酒吗
Little drink?

656
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,710
美酒  音乐  烛光
Wine, music, candlelight.

657
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:44,080
这场景似曾相识  杰克
I think we've traveled down this road before, Jack.

658
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,050
是的
Yes, we have.

659
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,420
我记得很清楚
I remember it well.

660
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:55,090
摇摆  舞动  旋转  缠绵
Winding, twisting and turning, gyrating, writhing.

661
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:57,560
无尽的缠绵
Incessant writhing.

662
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,560
还记得圣多米尼克吗
Do you recall Saint Dominique?

663
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,560
马提尼克岛
La Martinique.

664
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,400
我在圣多米尼克想杀你来着
I tried to kill you in Saint Dominique.

665
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,300
管他呢
Either or.

666
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,130
作为大副这太不合适了
Hardly appropriate for a first mate.

667
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:12,730
我是第一个吗  我真好奇
Was I the first? I've often wondered.

668
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,110
你有所求的时候总是这么迷人  杰克
You can be so charming when you want something, Jack.

669
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,740
问题在于发现你想要什么
The trick is finding out what.

670
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:22,950
真相  对吧
The truth, then, is it?

671
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,150
黑胡子已经达到目的了
Blackbeard has served his purpose.

672
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:28,620
我们可以一起去不老泉
You and I can go to the Fountain together,

673
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,820
我们可以共同名扬四海
where we shall bathe one another in equal shares of fame

674
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,990
还可以花样百出  纵情享乐
and other assorted debaucheries.

675
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:37,120
我告诉你怎样进行不老泉的仪式
And I'll tell you the ritual of the Fountain.

676
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:40,100
对  渎神仪式
Yes. The profane ritual.

677
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:45,000
我能相信你吗  杰克
Can I trust you, Jack?

678
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:49,580
-我需要你支持我  -最亲爱的安琪莉卡
- I need you on my side. - Oh, my dearest Angelica.

679
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,140
我们现在亲密无间  我的爱
You and I are as thick as thieves, love.

680
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,520
告诉我方法
Tell me the rules.

681
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:01,320
不老泉的泉水
Water from the Fountain of Youth.

682
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,600
美人鱼闪烁的眼泪
The shimmering tear of a mermaid.

683
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:10,030
庞塞・德莱昂的圣杯
The silver chalices of Ponce de Leon.

684
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:13,700
有了这些东西...
With these items...

685
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,970
-什么  -有了这些东西
- Yes? - With these items,

686
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:19,510
你就能得到另一个人的所有寿命  杰克
you may take all the years of life from another, Jack.

687
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,610
你知道这意味着什么
You know what that means.

688
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,650
我们不能自己去  你和我
We cannot go alone, you and I.

689
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,050
仪式需要一个祭品
The ritual requires a victim.

690
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:34,660
-这太不幸了  -确实
- That is unfortunate. - Yes, it is.

691
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:38,530
我发现自己不是很想去不老泉了
I find my desire for the Fountain greatly lessened.

692
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:42,560
不过船上确实有你想要的东西
But there is something onboard you do want.

693
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,710
黑胡子发现怎么办
What about Blackbeard?

694
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,440
他在海图室里  我们得快点
He's in the chart room. We'll have to be quick.

695
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:05,110
他把这些船当作战利品
He keeps each ship as a prize.

696
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:11,350
你帮我  我就让你选一艘
You help me, and I promise you your pick.

697
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,900
不过我想我知道你会选哪艘
Though I think I know the one you will choose.

698
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:23,260
黑珍珠号在瓶子里
The Black Pearl in a bottle?

699
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:25,140
为什么黑珍珠号会在瓶子里
Why is the Black Pearl in a bottle?

700
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,780
它缩小后更讨人厌
He's even more annoying in miniature.

701
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,950
-成交吗  杰克  -安琪莉卡  我了解你
- Do we have a deal, Jack? - Angelica, I know you.

702
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:40,960
你不会向无辜的人窃取生命
You are not going to steal the life of some innocent man.

703
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:43,820
那个独腿男人怎么样
What about the one-legged man?

704
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:47,730
我需要寿命  杰克
I need years, Jack.

705
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:52,970
不是给我  是给我父亲
Not for me. For my father.

706
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,910
我真是黑胡子的女儿
I am truly the daughter of Blackbeard.

707
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:01,110
你骗人骗得分不清现实了  亲爱的
You've fallen for your own con, love.

708
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:03,510
不  他确实是我父亲
No, he is my father.

709
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,380
我对你说的谎言其实不是谎言
The lies I told you were not lies.

710
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:10,050
你用真相对我撒谎
You lied to me by telling me the truth?

711
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,180
-对  -真不错
- Yes. - That's very good.

712
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,790
-可以借用吗  -反正你总会用
- May I use that? - I'm sure you will, anyway.

713
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:17,290
当然了
Of course I will.

714
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:20,130
所以  你不会放弃是吧
So, will you not give up this quest?

715
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:23,860
我想有个父亲  杰克  以前从没有过
I want a father, Jack. I haven't had one.

716
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,400
安琪莉卡  你父亲  黑胡子
Angelica, your father, Blackbeard...

717
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,310
是个魔鬼
he is evil,

718
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,640
一旦有机会他就会杀了你
and he will kill you given the chance.

719
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,870
-他已经没救了  -你凭什么
- He cannot be saved. - And who are you to set

720
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:39,210
决定谁能被救赎
the limits on redemption?

721
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:42,680
你偷走了我的年华  杰克  你欠我的
You stole years of my life, Jack. You owe me.

722
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:45,880
你这是要害死自己
And you are en route to getting yourself killed,

723
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,360
我不会就这么袖手旁观
and I am not inclined to stand by and watch.

724
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:52,220
白浪湾
Whitecap Bay!

725
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,830
全员集合  放下大艇
All hands on deck! Set to the longboats!

726
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:05,830
把网展平
Lay'em out flat!

727
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:11,310
别弄乱  得为我们的贵宾弄得漂亮点
No tangles. Make'em look pretty for our dainty guests.

728
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:15,250
我们需要光  很亮的光
We're gonna need light. A lot of light.

729
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,050
过来
Come!

730
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:44,000
闻见了吗  鲸鱼油  烧起来像神迹
Smell that? Whale oil. Stuff burns like a miracle from God.

731
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:48,950
-能让它亮起来吗  -英国人造的
- Can you make it work? - Made by the English.

732
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,210
别抱太大希望
Let's not get our hopes up.

733
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:03,200
月亮才刚刚露出一牙
The old moon in the arms of the new one.

734
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:04,560
夏季的第一弯新月

735
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:08,700
猎取美人鱼眼泪的完美时机
Perfect for hunting a mermaid's tear.

736
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:24,890
我们完了  她们会被人造光吸引过来
We're doomed. They be drawn to man-made light.

737
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,720
-鲨鱼吗  -比鲨鱼还可怕  孩子
- Sharks? - Worse than sharks, boy.

738
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,380
一小时之内美人鱼就会到这来
There'll be mermaids upon us within the hour,

739
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:33,990
记住我的话  我们是诱饵
you mark my words. And we're the bait.

740
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,070
听说美人鱼的吻
I heard it said a kiss from a mermaid

741
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:42,300
能保护水手不被淹死
protects a sailor from drowning.

742
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,310
别犯傻了孩子  美人鱼全是雌性
Don't be a fool! Mermaids are all female, son,

743
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,240
像梦中的天堂一样美丽
and lovely as a dream of heaven.

744
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:53,650
但当她们露出本性  据说
But when it comes time to churn butter, so to speak,

745
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,780
她们会把水手拖出船外
they snatch a sailor out of a boat

746
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,950
或者拖下甲板  总之是这样
or off the deck of a ship, have their way,

747
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:04,030
然后把他们拖到海底  淹死吃掉
and then the sailors are pulled to bottom and drowned and eaten.

748
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:07,920
或者有时候  正好相反
Or, sometimes, the other way around.

749
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:11,830
-唱歌  -什么
- Sing. - What?

750

她们喜欢听人唱歌
They like to hear singing.

751

我是商人的女儿
A merchant's daughter fair

753
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,310

754
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,650
每一年赚上三千英镑
And 3,000 pounds a year

755
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:36,820
我的心被丘比特射中
My heart is pierced by Cupid

756
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,400
我对金子也不屑一顾
I disdain all glittering gold

757
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:44,020
只有快乐勇敢的水手
There is nothing can console me

758
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:47,070
能让我的心得到慰藉
But my jolly sailor bold

759
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:52,800
我的心被丘比特射中

762
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:04,150
能让我的心得到慰藉
But my jolly sailor bold

763
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,560
神啊  救救我吧
Lord save me.

764
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:30,300
看  看那边
Man, look. Look there.

765
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:32,240
你会吓到她
You'll scare her off!

766
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:33,910
那可真是谢天谢地
Aye, and good riddance!

767
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,590
你会说话吗

- Aye, that I be. - Scrum, comport yourself!

773
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:11,540
大伙们  我短暂而悲惨的一生中
Boys! There ain't much been given to me

774
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:14,090
从来没得到过什么  真的
in my brief, miserable life, there's the truth in it.

775
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,950
但是  天哪  我现在得说
But, by God, I'll have it said

776

鼓起勇气  把她们赶到岸边
Muster your courage! Drive'em to shore!

796

把网撒进水里  快

撤退  所有人上岸  保命要紧
Retreat, all, to land! For your lives!

798
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:07,290
快撤退
Retreat, I say!

799
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:09,450
胆小鬼  回水里去
Cowards! Back in the water!

800
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:13,790
岸上没地方给你们躲  我说到做到
There be no refuge on land! On my word!

801
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:48,420
来

查看伤员
Check the wounded!

805

看能不能找到还活着的美人鱼
See if you can find one mermaid still alive!

806
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,440
快来  搭把手
Come, give a hand!

807
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:21,710
干得漂亮  水手

大家都看见了吗
Did everyone see that?

809
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:26,520
下次我绝对不这么玩了
Because I will not be doing it again.

810
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:31,330
回船  驶向安全地带  快点
Back to the ship. We head for a protected cove. Now.

811
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:51,120
-老天  这难道是...  -美人鱼
- Lord. Is that? - Mermaid.

812
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:54,780
-放弃这疯狂任务吧  -不行
- Give up this madness now. - I cannot.

813
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:56,680
你走在沙滩上的时候
Ever walk on the beach,

814
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:59,120
会不会回头看自己留下的脚印们
look back and see your footsteps in the sand?

815
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:03,250
就是这感觉  不过我的脚印们朝向前方
It's like that, except the footsteps lie before me.

816
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:07,230
-是脚印  没有"们"  -白浪湾  长官
- Footstep, actually. - Whitecap Bay, sir.

817
01:10:07,330 --> 01:10:08,960
我们必须加快步伐
We must hasten.

818
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:20,640
咱们用走的  吉布斯  需要有人带路
We travel by foot. Gibbs, I require a heading.

819
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:23,940
-但是长官  我们的船员...  -他们已经死了
- But, sir, the men. - They be dead already.

820
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,180
-听起来还没死  -真的吗
- They don't sound dead. - Oh, is that so?

821
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:31,660
我只听到海鸥筑巢的声音而已
Well, I hear nothing but seagulls nesting.

822
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:33,850
你听见什么声音了  格洛夫斯先生  
What is it that you hear, Mr. Groves?

823
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:40,330
海鸥...在筑巢
Seagulls... nesting.

824
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:43,530
-没有别的了  -领路  吉布斯
- Nothing more. - Heading, Gibbs?

825
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:53,740
老天
My God.

826
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:55,940
你不领头  我就领走你的头
Your head or my heading.

827
01:10:56,050 --> 01:10:58,280
任选其一  我无所谓
I'll have me one or t'other, I don't care which.

828
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,720
全体前进
All hands, forward!

829
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:25,670
-该你上场了  史派罗  -这样真有必要吗
- It's to you now, Sparrow. - Was that really necessary?

830
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:28,440
你最好不要知道我的船的下落
Best you not know the exact whereabouts of my ship.

831
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:33,310
-我可是个谨慎的人  -我也是
- I be a cautious man. - So be I.

832
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,180
但我最想知道的是
What I want first...

833
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:40,790
庞塞・德莱昂的船在哪
...is Ponce De Leon's ship.

834
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,730
我们为什么要带她一起走
Why is it we've got to bring her along?

835
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:23,100
我们需要新鲜的眼泪
Because tears don't keep. We need them fresh.

836
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,970
这什么仪式来着
What is the ritual again?

837
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:28,570
泉中水和人鱼泪
Water from the Fountain and a mermaid's tear?

838
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:30,230
还有两只银圣杯
And two silver chalices.

839
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:33,040
一杯有眼泪  一杯没有
One cup with a tear, one without.

840
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:36,720
就是两杯都有水  一杯里有泪
So, one with a tear and water in both?

841
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,380
还真够麻烦的  是吧
Quite complicated, is it not?

842
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:41,580
两杯都有水  其中一杯有眼泪 
Both get water. One gets a tear.

843
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,380
喝那杯带眼泪的人
The person who drinks the water with the tear

844
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:46,980
能获得喝另一杯的人的所有寿命
gets all the years of life from the other.

845
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:50,260
那是多少年
How many years?

846
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,670
所有已生之年
All the years that they have lived,

847
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,330
和剩下的未活之年  如果命运发慈悲的话
and they could have lived, if fate had been kinder.

848
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:08,950
牧师
Clergyman.

849
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,850
万一万一我遭遇啥不测
On the off chance that this does not go well for me,

850
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:15,550
我想跟你说
I would like it noted here and now

851
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:18,950
我愿意相信你那些有的没的
that I am fully prepared to believe in whatever I must,

852
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:20,860
让我也能进那个好地方
so that I may be welcomed into that place

853
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:23,430
就是那些虚伪的老好人去的地方  懂?
where all the goody-goodies get to go. Savvy?

854
01:13:23,530 --> 01:13:27,190
我们有个术语  杰克  你可以皈依
We have a word for that, Jack. You can convert.

855
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:29,830
我是想等到万不得已再说
I was thinking more of an as-needed basis.

856
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:35,100
舵手
Quartermaster!

857
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,440
-怎么  -她不能呼吸了
- Aye? - She cannot breathe!

858
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:40,640
-箱里有水  -她需要空气
- She has water. - She needs air!

859
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:46,520
-把盖子打开  -她会逃走
- Open this. - She will escape.

860
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:50,380
-你会杀了她  -我支持传教士
- You're killing her. - I support the missionary's position.

861
01:13:58,900 --> 01:13:59,990
看见了吗
See?

862
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,730
继续前进
Onward.

863
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:34,390
和我想的一样  此路不通
Just as I thought. Not this way!

864
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:37,900
应该朝这边走  不是吗
This is the way, isn't it?

865
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,870
方向当然对  但是应该从东边绕过去
'Course it is, but we should go around to the east.

866
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:42,870
那就不是去拿圣杯的路线了
That would take us out of the path of the chalices.

867
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:44,770
-我们可以绕回去  -没那么多时间
- Well, then we'll circle back. - There is no time.

868
01:14:44,910 --> 01:14:46,570
是你非要带着那美人鱼
You're the one who insisted on bringing the bloody mermaid.

869
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:48,700
-那你还组织叛变  -你走得还真像个娘们
- Well, the mutiny didn't help. - You walk like a girl.

870
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:50,940
-你想见识见识  -必须有人过去
- You would know. - Someone must go.

871
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:53,540
你是说分头行动
You mean split up?

872
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:56,590
你是说有人跳下去吧  我也想看人跳下去
You mean jump? This I cannot wait to see.

873
01:14:56,720 --> 01:15:00,720
史派罗跳下去  找到船  拿回圣杯
Sparrow will go. Find the ship, retrieve the chalices.

874
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:02,860
史派罗  你觉得他还会回来吗
Sparrow? What makes you think he will come back?

875
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:06,230
是啊  你觉得他还会回来吗
Yes, what makes you think he will come back?

876
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:08,860
我们不能相信他  爸爸  让我去
We cannot trust him, Father. I'll go.

877
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:11,430
她说她去
She'll go.

878
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,810
离泉水还有多远
How much farther to the Fountain?

879
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:18,640
我没有时间了
I'm running out of time.

880
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:22,780
大概沿着河  朝北走一天 
About a day's march north, following that river,

881
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:26,410
就会看到一堆水塘  那就快到了
you'll get to a series of pools. Then you're close.

882
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:30,150
跳吧
You will go.

883
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:35,360
我就知道会变成这样
I was sure it would come to this.

884
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:50,530
你们知道站在高处时
You know that feeling you get

885
01:15:50,530 --> 01:15:53,110
有时候会有那么一种
sometimes when you're standing in a high place?

886
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:55,180
特想往下跳的感觉吗
Sudden urge to jump?

887
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,640
我就没有这种感觉
I don't have it.

888
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:01,580
我需要圣杯
I need those chalices.

889
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:04,180
开枪吧  还省得我自己跳了
Shoot. Save me the bother of the fall.

890
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:07,380
你跳下去  然后来找我
You will go. You will return...

891
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:10,690
要不然  我就杀了她
...or I will kill her.

892
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,020
你不会杀自己的女儿
You won't kill your own daughter.

893
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:17,970
舵手  再给我拿六把手枪
Quartermaster, get me six more pistols,

894
01:16:18,110 --> 01:16:19,700
卸了子弹  留两支枪里有子弹
remove the shot from all but two,

895
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,330
别告诉我是哪两支
but do not tell me which two.

896
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:27,210
该你选了  史派罗
You get to choose, Mr. Sparrow.

897
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:31,180
不对
No.

898
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:34,410
不对
No.

899
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:40,360
-这个  -你确定
- Yes. - You're sure?

900
01:16:40,490 --> 01:16:41,960
当然确定
'Course I am.

901
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:51,230
再来
Again.

902
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:55,300
拜托  根本就没子弹
Please, they're not even loaded.

903
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:01,510
再来
Again.

904
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:04,250
你要是那么想杀了她
If you're so keen on killing her,

905
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:06,780
-为啥不让她跳  -什么
- why don't you just let her jump? - What?

906
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:10,050
如果你跳下去  跌死了
If you jump and die,

907
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:13,850
就轮到她了
then she will have her chance.

908
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:15,460
再来
Again.

909
01:17:20,730 --> 01:17:24,600
如果我跳下去  有活得可能吗
...if I jump, will I survive?

910
01:17:26,910 --> 01:17:28,270
玩偶给我
The doll.

911
01:17:44,590 --> 01:17:49,360
-这样你也许就死不了  -简直胡扯  我跳
- Yes, now you will survive. - This is nonsense! I'm going!

912
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:11,310
湿了  又湿了
Wet. Wet again.

913
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:16,520
继续出发  向北走
We go on. Due north to the Fountain.

914
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,720
演得不错  父亲
Well played, Father.

915
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:22,790
您早就知道哪两把枪有子弹吧
You knew which guns were loaded, right?

916
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,490
当然  亲爱的
Of course, my love.

917
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:39,870
要是有地图就好了
Be nice to have a map about now.

918
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:41,670
或者有艘船也行
Or a ship.

919
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:46,150
站住  不许动
Stop! Hold very still.

920
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:51,110
不能让它碰到你
Ye dare not let it touch your skin.

921
01:18:59,830 --> 01:19:03,100
怎么  上了年纪的人有点爱好不行吗
What? What be wrong with an older man having a hobby?

922
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,760
停下干什么  赶紧走
What are you stopping for, eh? Push on!

923
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:08,100
-赶紧走  -死了之后有你睡的
- Push on! - You can sleep when you're dead.

924
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:09,440
赶紧走
Push on!

925
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:14,380
幸运女神继续眷顾我们
Fortune continues to favor us.

926
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:44,370
圣地亚哥
The Santiago.

927
01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:47,240
庞塞・德莱昂曾让它享誉一时
Famously captained by Ponce de Leon.

928
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:51,480
没有围观群众
There's no one there.

929
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:52,610
好吧
Right, then.

930
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:28,720
不能停下
We must not stop.

931
01:20:36,730 --> 01:20:38,530
你得自己走
You will walk.

932
01:20:57,650 --> 01:20:59,810
我不会走
I cannot.

933
01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:01,750
不走就得死
Walk or die.

934
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:09,420
环着我的脖子
Put your arms around me.

935
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:12,960
-我没要你帮我  -但你需要我的帮助
- I do not ask for help. - But you need it.

936
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:34,180
-不是赶路吗  -别拖后腿
- We're in a hurry, yes? - Do not fall behind.

937
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:55,270
在这休息一会
Hold here 'til I say!

938
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,190
你真美
Such beauty.

939
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:13,660
你一定是上帝创造的
Surely you're one of God's own creations,

940
01:22:13,790 --> 01:22:16,730
不是那些未能踏上诺亚方舟的
and not a descendant of those dark creatures

941
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:19,160
黑暗而堕落生物的后代
who found no refuge on the Ark.

942
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:24,060
如此的美
Such beauty...

943
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:26,970
却又致命
...and yet deadly.

944
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:31,400
-致命?  不  -你攻击了我
- Deadly? No. - You attacked me.

945
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:36,500
不  你不同
No. You are different.

946
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:38,650
不同吗
Different?

947
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:42,780
不是吗  你保护了我  
Are you not? You protect.

948
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:47,250
是吗
Did you?

949
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:51,690
你把我推开了
You pushed me down out of the way.

950
01:22:52,830 --> 01:22:57,330
-你看见不老泉了吗  -没有  但已经很近了
- You see the Fountain? - No, but we are close.

951
01:22:57,870 --> 01:22:59,740
带上那生物  捂上她的头
Bring the creature. Cover its head.

952
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:01,860
她有名字
She has a name!

953
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:07,900
请讲
Pray tell.

954
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:16,020
她是塞蕾娜
She is Syrena.

955
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,490
庞塞・德莱昂
Ponce de Leon.

956
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:05,870
四十个海盗连着四十个晚上梦见的财宝
If 40 pirates dreamt 40 nights of treasure,

957
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:09,600
也赶不上这屋里的财宝   
it would not match the contents of this room.

958
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:11,300
是你
You.

959
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,880
-你  -不   
- You. - No...

960
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:19,310
-你  -是我先来的
-...you. - I was here first.

961
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:23,480
-你为什么来这  -黑胡子派我来的   
- You, why are you here? - Blackbeard sent me.

962
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:26,110
-你呢  -银圣杯  
- Why are you? - Silver chalices

963
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:29,630
-为我的陛下  -得了
- for my royal liege. - Oh, please.

964
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:32,660
后退  后退  我们必须保证船的平衡
Back, back! We have to balance it out!

965
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:37,230
这船会滑下去   
The whole ship will slide!

966
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:42,630
那好吧
Right, then.

967
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:48,710
那要是我们各选一样差不多沉的东西呢
What if we each choose an item of approximately equal weight?

968
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:52,820
放回去   
Put it back!

969
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,380
我们什么也不能动   
We touch nothing!

970
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:05,260
那个呢
What about that?

971
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:07,800
圣杯 
The chalices.

972
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:11,030
凭什么你先看
Oi! Why do you get to look first?

973
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:12,870
那好吧
Fine, then.

974
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:33,680
-一起看  -一起看   
- Together. - Together.

975
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,420
石头
Rocks.

976
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,860
那些西班牙佬
The Spanish.

977
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:42,260
伙计  他们比我们早来一步   
They're ahead of us, mate.

978
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:46,430
我该看看那地图  要是我想的没错...
I shall have a look at that map. If it's what I fear...

979
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:58,750
他们怎么会把这东西留下   
I wonder why they left this behind.

980
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:05,520
别碰那地图   
Don't touch the map.

981
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:11,960
他们知道了路线   
They know the path,

982
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:16,000
但我也知道他们最可能在哪驻营
but I can also see where they'll most likely make camp.

983
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:30,780
杰克
Jack!

984
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:38,120
吉布斯  我正要去监狱救你来着
Gibbs, I was just on me way to break you out of jail.

985
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:41,580
你偷了我的地图   
You stole my map.

986
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:44,600
好了  行动
Right. Best be started.

987
01:27:06,550 --> 01:27:08,040
美人鱼 
Mermaids.

988
01:27:10,890 --> 01:27:13,830
小心  这些水塘很深   
Careful, these pools run deep.

989
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:17,520
如果她逃了  就全完了  舵手   
If she escapes, all is lost. Quartermaster.

990
01:27:19,170 --> 01:27:22,460
看  看好了
Look. Look!

991
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:27,010
她被系在桩上  在太阳下暴晒
Staked out to die, to dry in the sun.

992
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:30,740
身体一半在水中  不够活命
Only half in the water. Not enough to live,

993
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:35,070
只能慢慢死去
but just enough to make the dying slow.

994
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:37,310
考虑一下吧   
Think on it.

995
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:40,850
你的族群被杀害  只是为了眼泪   
Your people, murdered, harvested for their tears.

996
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:45,320
塞蕾娜  你难道不想哭吗   
Syrena, won't you cry?

997
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:48,020
你也难逃一死
All die, even you.

998
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:51,620
-快了  -听着   
- Soon, I hear. - Listen...

999
01:27:53,670 --> 01:27:55,530
听好了
Listen.

1000
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:59,000
你难道听不到你姐妹们的呼喊
Can you not hear your sisters scream?

1001
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:01,570
听不到吗
Do you not hear them?

1002
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:05,410
我们只需要一滴眼泪   
We need but one tear.

1003
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:09,580
下贱的生物
Vile creature!

1004
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:12,310
-一根根切掉她的手指  -掐死她   
- Chop off her fingers, one by one! - Choke her!

1005
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:15,050
从眼睛底下挖出眼泪来   
Cut out the tears from behind the eyes!

1006
01:28:15,190 --> 01:28:16,520
你看得下去吗
Where's your voice in this?

1007
01:28:17,390 --> 01:28:20,420
也许日出后她就转变心意了
Maybe she'll have a change of heart when the sun rises.

1008
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:24,460
对  她会灼伤  但我等不到日出 
Oh, aye, she will burn, but I cannot wait for the sun.

1009
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:26,330
也许我们应该生把火
Perhaps we should build a fire.

1010
01:28:26,430 --> 01:28:28,590
-不行  -不准质疑我  教士   
- No. - Do not contest me, cleric.

1011
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:31,800
-你们不准折磨她  -我们只需要一滴眼泪   
- You will not torture her. - We need only one tear.

1012
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:35,100
可以的话  我会把她的鳞一片一片剥下来
I will tear every scale from her body one by one if I see fit.

1013
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:36,800
要是你不满意  祈祷去吧
If that displeases you, go pray.

1014
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:40,070
我错了  并不是所有灵魂都能拯救  你无药可救
I was wrong. Not every soul can be saved. Yours cannot.

1015
01:28:40,210 --> 01:28:43,080
看啊  各位  曾经有信仰的人
Behold, gentlemen, a man formerly of faith.

1016
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:46,120
你说她是卑贱的生物  但你还赶不上她万分之一     
That vile creature, as you call her, is worth a hundred of you.

1017
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:48,020
哟  你关心她   
Oh, you care for her?

1018
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:52,050
你爱她   
You fancy her.

1019
01:28:53,730 --> 01:28:56,460
我看得一清二楚  别否认这份感情
And do not deny what is clear to my eyes.

1020
01:28:58,260 --> 01:28:59,390
问题是   
Question is...

1021
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:04,560
她爱不爱你   
...does she fancy you?

1022
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:10,400
老天爷  她还真爱你  走运了
My God, she does. We are in luck!

1023
01:29:11,810 --> 01:29:13,710
流下一滴眼泪
Bring forth a tear...

1024
01:29:15,210 --> 01:29:17,740
或见证这可怜生命的消亡   
...or witness the death of this poor soul.

1025
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:23,320
塞蕾娜  如果你能流下一滴眼泪   
Syrena, if you could manage a tear,

1026
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:25,050
我将万分感激
I would be grateful.

1027
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:27,980
悲伤  是有
Sadness, yes,

1028
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:33,530
-但却并不悲痛  -别脏了您的手  父亲   
- but no sorrow... yet. - Not by your hand, Father!

1029
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:36,330
时间不等人  舵手
Time and tide wait for none. Quartermaster.

1030
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:52,140
美人鱼还真难搞   
Aye, mermaids are tough.

1031
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:54,310
都够难搞的
The lot of them.

1032
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:58,860
把她绑起来  把这尸体处理了   
Tie her up like the others. And get rid of this.

1033
01:30:03,430 --> 01:30:06,420
-你有信心吗  -有
- You are confident? - Yes.

1034
01:30:06,530 --> 01:30:09,520
我是女人  她也是
I am a woman. So is she.

1035
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:20,570
你这是演的哪一出  杰克  和巴博萨搭起伙来了
What's your play, Jack? Throwing in with Barbossa.

1036
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:23,440
有个姑娘...   
There is a girl...

1037
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:26,780
...一个女性...异性   
...A female... of the opposite sex.

1038
01:30:26,890 --> 01:30:30,850
-姑娘不是异性是什么  -也许应该说是少女   
- When is there not? - Perhaps I should say "Damsel."

1039
01:30:30,990 --> 01:30:34,020
-你还救少女吗  -万事总有第一次
- You're rescuing a damsel? - Well, there's a first.

1040
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:37,390
但有可能我让这个所谓的少女 
Yes, but it's just that I may have caused said damsel

1041
01:30:37,530 --> 01:30:41,130
-几个月前受伤了  -不奇怪
- some manner of harm many moons ago. - Out with it.

1042
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:44,570
吉布斯  她是个塞维利亚的女人
Gibbs, this is the woman from Seville.

1043
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:46,430
你装作喜欢她   
Ah, you pretended to love her,

1044
01:30:46,430 --> 01:30:48,610
结果你离开她  伤了她的心
then you left her and broke her heart.

1045
01:30:48,770 --> 01:30:53,470
比这更糟  我也许是  简短地说  就是
Worse. I may have had, briefly, mind you...

1046
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:58,810
-造成了她内心波动  -波动     
- ...stirrings. - Stirrings?

1047
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:02,910
-波动  -什么  就是有感情了吧   
- Stirrings. - What? Like feelings, you mean?

1048
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:06,080
不不不  不是那个意思  更像是...   
No, no, no. Not quite all the way to feelings. More like...

1049
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:11,820
好吧  就是感情  该死的
All right, feelings, damn you.

1050
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:16,630
结果你还是离开了她  够低级的
And you left her still. That's low.

1051
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:19,300
谢谢   
Thank you.

1052
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:27,650
秘密行动 
Stealth over force.

1053
01:31:27,810 --> 01:31:31,540
接下来我搞定好了  你不太方便
I'll take it from here on account of your condition.

1054
01:31:32,690 --> 01:31:34,550
你没招白蚁吧     
You don't have termites, do you?

1055
01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:36,660
感谢你的关心  杰克
I appreciate your concern, Jack,

1056
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:39,310
但我还是会盯着你
but I'll be keeping you company all the same.

1057
01:31:39,490 --> 01:31:42,550
在这等着  大副  等我指示  
Hold here, Lieutenant Commander. Wait for my signal.

1058
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:16,620
那边那个  就是头领
There. That one. That be the leader.

1059
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:19,250
记住他的帐篷  那就是...
Make note of his tent because that's where...

1060
01:32:20,730 --> 01:32:24,970
等等  老天  那肯定就是圣杯了
No, wait. My God, that must be them right there.

1061
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:30,700
你的剑闻起来很搞笑   
Your sword smells funny.

1062
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:35,780
是  我涂了蟾蜍内脏的毒
Aye. Poison from the innards of poisonous toads.

1063
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:39,010
蹭一下  几分钟内你就死了
Just a scratch, you're a dead man in minutes.

1064
01:32:39,150 --> 01:32:41,480
你能不能别用剑指着我   
Would you mind pointing it the other way?

1065
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:43,380
我不喜欢蟾蜍   
I don't like toads.

1066
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:51,700
-你在干嘛  -计划逃生路线 
- What are you doing? - Planning an escape route.

1067
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:55,930
-你不也这样计划吗  -当然   
- Isn't that how you do it? - Yes.

1068
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:59,160
不过有时候我只是...即兴发挥
Or sometimes I just... improvise.

1069
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:27,660
现在怎么办
Now what?

1070
01:33:28,530 --> 01:33:31,060
咱们逛出去  慢而坚定
We stroll out, slow and steady.

1071
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,030
理所应当一样   
Just like we belong.

1072
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:36,730
-抱歉  塞蕾娜  -菲利普  你还活着
- I'm sorry, Syrena. - Philip, you're alive.

1073
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:41,070
-是  -你来救我吗   
- Yes. - You came for me.

1074
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:44,430
为什么   
Why?

1075
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:48,840
你是不同的吧
You're different, are you not?

1076
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:55,420
你善良  有同情心  是吧
Do you know not of kindness? Compassion?

1077
01:35:12,610 --> 01:35:14,600
悲痛才不会让它们落泪
Tears of sorrow, never.

1078
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:17,170
美人鱼太坚强了   
Mermaids be too tough for that.

1079
01:35:17,310 --> 01:35:19,470
但喜悦的眼泪   
But tears of joy...

1080
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:23,410
都说这更有效
They say these be the more potent anyway.

1081
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:26,510
塞蕾娜  我发誓  我并不知情   
Syrena, on my word, I had no part in this.

1082
01:35:27,790 --> 01:35:29,220
放她走吧  你现在不需要她了
Let her go. You don't need her now.

1083
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:32,320
放她走  没门
Let her go? No.

1084
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:35,450
把她捆好  让她自生自灭
Secure her bonds. We leave her with her own.

1085
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
想出什么逃跑方案了吗
How's that escape route working?

1086
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:50,110
展示你随机应变的时刻到了
Here's your chance to improvise.

1087
01:35:50,210 --> 01:35:51,540
我在想呢
I'm attempting it.

1088
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:54,510
大概我能松出一只手
I might be able to get a hand loose.

1089
01:35:54,650 --> 01:35:56,910
你带着刀呢  非常好
Oh, you got a knife. That's very good.

1090
01:35:58,020 --> 01:35:59,540
比刀还好
Better.

1091
01:36:04,990 --> 01:36:06,250
我也要喝
I want one of those.

1092
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:15,200
复仇真是甜美甘洌啊
Here's to revenge. Sweet and clear.

1093
01:36:15,330 --> 01:36:19,790
-什么复仇  -得了吧  赫克托
- Revenge? - Come, come, Hector.

1094
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:21,340
你如果想要那圣杯
If you wanted the chalices,

1095
01:36:21,470 --> 01:36:24,170
你会眼睁睁看着它落入他人囊中吗
you'd seen they were missing and gone.

1096
01:36:24,310 --> 01:36:27,470
你在伺机候着黑胡子
You were lying in wait, for Blackbeard.

1097
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:32,680
乔治国王  私掠船  假发
King George. Privateer. Wig.

1098
01:36:33,820 --> 01:36:35,250
这些伎俩太低级了
Cheap theatrical facade.

1099
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:38,250
-我才不信呢  -那晚你没在
- I'm not buying it. - You weren't there that night.

1100
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:39,990
黑珍珠沉没的时候吗
When the Pearl was lost?

1101
01:36:39,990 --> 01:36:42,220
不是沉没  是被夺走了
Taken, not lost.

1102
01:36:44,830 --> 01:36:48,960
我们刚从伊斯岛起航就遭到了袭击
We were off the coast of Hispaniola when we came under attack.

1103
01:36:49,130 --> 01:36:52,570
没有征兆  没有警告  也没有谈判
No provocation nor warning nor offer of parley.

1104
01:36:52,710 --> 01:36:55,370
上来就是连天的炮火
We were peppered with cannon fire.

1105
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:59,740
随后  海面翻滚起来
And then the sea beneath the Pearl began to roil.

1106
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,710
黑珍珠开始剧烈晃动
The Pearl was pitching and yawing violently.

1107
01:37:03,850 --> 01:37:05,710
每块甲板  每道栏杆
Every plank, every rail,

1108
01:37:05,850 --> 01:37:08,720
每根船杆全都开始吱嘎作响
every spar, all at once, began to creak.

1109
01:37:08,850 --> 01:37:11,880
帆缆也好像有了生命
The rigging had come to life.

1110
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:14,720
我们的船叛变了
Our own ship turned against us...

1111
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:18,130
缆绳就像毒蛇一样缠住船员
...tangling the crew, wrapping around 'em like snakes.

1112
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:20,660
缠住我的腿
And wrapping around me leg.

1113
01:37:20,830 --> 01:37:23,230
但我的胳膊还能动  剑也还在手里
But me arms were free and me sword was to hand.

1114
01:37:23,370 --> 01:37:26,900
我才是这船的主人  不是黑胡子
I am the master of me ship, not Blackbeard.

1115
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:30,530
我才是自己命运的主人  不是黑胡子
I am the master of my fate, not Blackbeard.

1116
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:33,910
所以我就采取了必要措施
So I did what needed done.

1117
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:42,690
我活了下来
I survived.

1118
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:48,450
也就是说  你不是要找不老泉
So... you're not after the Fountain.

1119
01:37:48,590 --> 01:37:52,260
我才不在乎国王的命令
I care not for King George or tavern yarns

1120
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,630
还是传闻说能治愈这瘸腿
that give hope for a healed limb.

1121
01:37:56,270 --> 01:37:59,930
但要是能干掉黑胡子  叫我牺牲左臂也情愿
But I'd give my left arm for a chance at Blackbeard.

1122
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:03,110
-干嘛不是右臂  -右臂要留着
- Not your right? - I need me good arm

1123
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:07,910
挥舞毒剑  刺穿他的心脏
to drive my poisoned blade through his heart.

1124
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,320
看来你的机会来了  伙计
I'll see you get the chance, mate.

1125
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:31,390
犯人逃跑了
The prisoner's escaping.

1126
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:41,370
他逃了  扇形散开  抓住他
He's escaping! Fan out! Find him!

1127
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:42,600
快跑
Go! Go!

1128
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:47,540
别开枪  我要抓活的
Hold your fire! I want him alive!

1129
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:57,720
我想那是信号
I figured that was the signal.

1130
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:44,290
-准备撤离  -敌人很快就追来了
- Go! Prepare to move out! - The enemy is soon upon us.

1131
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:47,310
圣杯的事我很遗憾
I'm sorry about the chalices,

1132
01:40:47,310 --> 01:40:48,970
杰克  但我还得赴个约
Jack, but I've an appointment to keep.

1133
01:40:49,110 --> 01:40:52,100
-我不会回去  -不用
- I'll not be going back. - No need.

1134
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:55,270
-喝一杯怎么样  -到了不老泉再喝
- Shall we have a drink? - We'll drink at the Fountain.

1135
01:41:13,630 --> 01:41:17,190
我们每次见面你都要冲我舞刀弄剑吗
How is it we can never meet without you pointing something at me?

1136
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,300
圣杯带来了吗  史派罗
You brought the chalices, Sparrow?

1137
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:23,030
当然
Aye. Oi!

1138
01:41:26,510 --> 01:41:29,640
-你还带了个朋友  -是的
- I see you brought a friend. - I did.

1139
01:41:29,780 --> 01:41:33,010
那个独腿海盗也在附近吧
And the one-legged man, he is near. Aye?

1140
01:41:33,150 --> 01:41:34,550
是的
Aye.

1141
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:36,380
现在
Now...

1142
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:38,000
在我交出它们之前
Before I go just handing them over,

1143
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,360
我有那么一两个要求
I do have one or two conditions.

1144
01:41:39,490 --> 01:41:41,550
-快说  -首先
- Name them. - Firstly,

1145
01:41:41,690 --> 01:41:44,060
我想要回指南针  不不  那是第二个
I'll be having me compass back. No, no, that's secondly.

1146
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:46,460
第一  你要答应
Firstly, upon your word,

1147
01:41:46,570 --> 01:41:48,560
绝不会伤害安琪莉卡
you will bring no harm to Angelica.

1148
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:51,070
我不会对你这种人保证什么  史派罗
I'll make no vows to the likes of you, Sparrow.

1149
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:53,670
但也不妨承认
But it costs me nothing to admit

1150
01:41:53,810 --> 01:41:56,670
她永远不会受到伤害
that she was never in harm's way.

1151
01:41:57,310 --> 01:41:59,500
那么第二条  就是之前的第一条
Secondly then, priorly firstly,

1152
01:41:59,650 --> 01:42:01,270
把指南针还我
I will be having me compass back.

1153
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:04,210
拜托了  这是我应得的
Please? I do deserve it.

1154
01:42:04,350 --> 01:42:05,620
你知不知道
Do you have any idea how

1155
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:07,840
抓住这头臭猪有多费劲
difficult it was to catch that filthy pig?

1156
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:10,350
不是大的那头  是四条腿的那头
Not the big one, the four-legged one.

1157
01:42:13,790 --> 01:42:17,560
谢谢  第三条  胡子先生
Thank you. And thirdly, Mr. Beard,

1158
01:42:17,700 --> 01:42:20,390
有的时候  偶尔
there are times, not very often,

1159
01:42:20,530 --> 01:42:23,630
我会回想起自己卑劣的所作所为
when I do reflect upon my heinous misdeeds.

1160
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:28,070
尤其是我对吉布斯先生的做法
Chief among them, I note how poorly I have treated Mr. Gibbs,

1161
01:42:28,210 --> 01:42:30,870
-我那忠心的大副  -现在你才说...
- my loyal first mate. - Aye! Now you bring it up...

1162
01:42:31,010 --> 01:42:33,710
那会我任由他在监狱受罪  毫不关心
Left him to rot in jail, I did. Didn't care.

1163
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:38,510
现在我也不关心  但问题是你得放他走
Still don't. But, point being, you must let him go free.

1164
01:42:40,350 --> 01:42:43,720
-就这样吗  -我想是的
- Is that it? - I think so.

1165
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:46,450
快决定  否则猪跑了看你怎么拿回杯子
Quick, or the pig runs, and good luck getting those chalices.

1166
01:42:46,590 --> 01:42:48,060
杰克  如果你不在乎这杯子  那我情愿...
Jack, if it's all the same to you, I'd be just as...

1167
01:42:48,190 --> 01:42:49,520
成交
Done.

1168
01:42:49,630 --> 01:42:50,860
放开那猪吧
Release the swine.

1169
01:42:56,640 --> 01:42:57,950
如果你不介意
Perhaps, if you don't mind,

1170
01:42:57,950 --> 01:42:59,900
我或许可以跟你们一起...
I could tag along with you folk for a...

1171
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:04,910
这能带你走向自由  伙计
This will lead you to freedom, mate.

1172
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:14,450
我发誓就在这附近
I could have swore it was somewhere right around here.

1173
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:46,910
我们不能停下
We must not stop.

1174
01:45:04,230 --> 01:45:05,660
死路
Dead end.

1175
01:45:06,670 --> 01:45:08,600
死路  结束了
Dead. End.

1176
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:10,700
死路
Dead end.

1177
01:45:11,740 --> 01:45:14,710
杰克  你知不知道要怎么走
Jack, I'm starting to think you don't know where you're going.

1178
01:45:15,510 --> 01:45:18,340
人们说  沿途风景要胜过目的地
It is not the destination so much as the journey, they say.

1179
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:21,010
请把圣杯给我
Chalices, if you please.

1180
01:45:33,020 --> 01:45:34,550
退后
Stand back.

1181
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:58,470
杰克
Jack...

1182
01:45:58,620 --> 01:46:00,550
你到底有没有
...have you ever, in fact...

1183
01:46:00,690 --> 01:46:06,180
亲眼见过不老泉
...seen with your own eyes... the Fountain of Youth?

1184
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:08,520
抱歉  你说什么来着
I'm sorry, could you repeat the question, please?

1185
01:46:08,690 --> 01:46:10,160
舵手
Quartermaster.

1186
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:12,060
不不
No, no!

1187
01:46:15,730 --> 01:46:17,860
等等
Wait, wait! Wait.

1188
01:46:21,140 --> 01:46:25,600
生命...之水[西班牙语]
"Aqua... de Vida."

1189
01:47:04,950 --> 01:47:07,480
史考姆先生
Master Scrum...

1190
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:10,490
-如果你不介意  -拿着这个吗
- ...do you mind? - Squire?

1191
01:48:09,180 --> 01:48:11,170
真美
So beautiful.

1192
01:48:50,660 --> 01:48:53,280
史派罗  我要第一个喝那泉水
Sparrow, I'll be the first to taste those waters.

1193
01:48:57,760 --> 01:48:59,350
父亲
Father.

1194
01:49:02,630 --> 01:49:04,930
独腿海盗
The one-legged man.

1195
01:49:07,470 --> 01:49:11,430
-你把他引来这里  -我会那么做吗
- You brought him here. - Would I do that?

1196
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:13,670
爱德华・提奇
Edward Teach!

1197
01:49:13,810 --> 01:49:17,110
鉴于你在公海犯下的种种罪行
For crimes committed on the high seas,

1198
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:21,120
国王陛下赋予我职权
by the authority granted me by His Majesty the King...

1199
01:49:21,250 --> 01:49:24,450
同时我个人也相当乐意
...and with a goodly amount of personal satisfaction...

1200
01:49:24,590 --> 01:49:27,650
拘押逮捕你
...I hereby place you in the custody of the court,

1201
01:49:27,790 --> 01:49:31,130
你是我的阶下囚
and declare you to be my prisoner.

1202
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:35,690
我气数已尽了吧
My trick's out, is that it?

1203
01:49:35,830 --> 01:49:40,270
罪名包括但不限于  海盗行为  通奸叛国
Such crimes do include, but are not limited to, piracy, treason,

1204
01:49:40,370 --> 01:49:44,540
蓄意谋杀以及残酷折磨
murder, torture of the most heinous sort,

1205
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:48,610
包括野蛮夺走一条饱经风霜的右腿
including the brutal theft of one used, twisted, hairy right leg.

1206
01:49:49,380 --> 01:49:54,080
你不怕面对这把剑吗
You... dare face this sword?

1207
01:49:54,250 --> 01:49:56,690
这里又不是你的船  当然不怕
This far away from your ship? Aye.

1208
01:49:56,820 --> 01:50:01,550
我能感到后背吹来冰冷的命运之息
Aye. That be the cold breath of fate I feel down my nape.

1209
01:50:01,690 --> 01:50:07,360
但老天作证  我要打这最后一战
But I'll have one last fight, by God.

1210
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:09,230
杀光他们
Kill 'em all!

1211
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:12,670
等一下
Hang on a minute.

1212
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:16,710
我只想弄清一件事
I just... I just need to understand something.

1213
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:20,210
你们要打他们
Right, so, you will fight against them,

1214
01:50:20,350 --> 01:50:21,680
他们又要打你们
they will fight against you.

1215
01:50:21,810 --> 01:50:25,510
而这只是因为他想要杀他
All on account of him wanting to kill him?

1216
01:50:25,650 --> 01:50:28,010
这是什么逻辑
Where is the sense?

1217
01:50:28,010 --> 01:50:29,590
对吧
Exactly.

1218
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:33,450
要我说不如让他们自己去打
I say, let them fight each other while we lay back,

1219
01:50:33,630 --> 01:50:37,060
我们退后观战  喝喝酒赌赌钱
watch, have a drink, place some wagers!

1220
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:39,460
好
Aye.

1221
01:50:42,030 --> 01:50:43,660
-杀掉他们  -不要怜悯敌人
- Kill 'em! - No quarter!

1222
01:51:14,130 --> 01:51:15,790
滚开
Get off me!

1223
01:51:48,770 --> 01:51:49,790
史考姆  圣杯
Scrum, the chalices!

1224
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:53,060
带上眼泪  跟我来
And the tear! Follow!

1225
01:51:57,080 --> 01:51:58,270
打啊
Fight!

1226
01:51:59,180 --> 01:52:02,740
交出眼泪来  好孩子
Hand it over. The tear. There's a good lad.

1227
01:52:02,850 --> 01:52:05,180
我更怕她一些
I'm more afraid of her than I am of you.

1228
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:13,120
交出来  好孩子
Hand it over. There's a good lad.

1229
01:52:16,490 --> 01:52:20,230
-把圣杯给我  -抱歉  杰克
- The chalices, if you please. - Sorry, Jack.

1230
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:24,630
我说过我需要寿命  看来用你的就行
I told you, I need years. And now, yours will do.

1231
01:52:32,540 --> 01:52:33,770
史考姆
Scrum!

1232
01:52:55,430 --> 01:52:56,900
塞蕾娜
Syrena...

1233
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:03,400
主啊  不要带走她
Oh God, you will not take her.

1234
01:53:03,540 --> 01:53:08,500
如果你带走了她  还她回来吧
If you have taken her, you will give her back.

1235
01:53:08,650 --> 01:53:11,010
还她回来
Give her back...

1236
01:53:11,150 --> 01:53:14,020
还她回来  求你了
Give her back, please. Please.

1237
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:40,370
我还期待命运给我安排个硬角色呢
I expected fate to put up more of a fight, eh?

1238
01:53:57,230 --> 01:54:01,030
你被我打到在地  有什么好高兴的
I will not have that smile on your face as I strike you down.

1239
01:54:02,430 --> 01:54:05,530
回头看看吧  爱德华・提奇
Take a gander, Edward Teach.

1240
01:54:36,070 --> 01:54:39,370
吾兹宣布  这片土地归伟大的
This land is hereby forever claimed in the glorious name

1241
01:54:39,540 --> 01:54:42,100
乔治国王陛下所有...
of His Majesty King George...

1242
01:54:48,350 --> 01:54:51,280
找人记录下那人的英勇行为
Someone make a note of that man's bravery.

1243
01:54:58,260 --> 01:55:01,990
小姐  请把圣杯交出来
Senorita, the chalices, por favor.

1244
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:21,510
只有上帝才能赋予人永生
Only God can grant eternal life,

1245
01:55:21,510 --> 01:55:24,340
而不是这邪恶的泉水
not this pagan water.

1246
01:55:35,390 --> 01:55:38,890
士兵们  毁掉这亵渎神圣的寺庙
Men, destroy this profane temple!

1247
01:55:41,630 --> 01:55:42,960
不老泉
The Fountain!

1248
01:55:57,020 --> 01:55:58,540
你这个蠢货
You are a fool.

1249
01:55:58,680 --> 01:56:01,980
你在这追寻的东西  只有信仰才能提供
You seek in this place what only faith can provide.

1250
01:56:02,090 --> 01:56:04,650
信仰?  确实有照亮世界的光明
Faith? In faith, there is light enough to see

1251
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:07,020
但也有吞噬万物的黑暗
but darkness enough to blind.

1252
01:56:10,630 --> 01:56:12,890
这是在搞什么鬼
What devilry is this?

1253
01:56:16,870 --> 01:56:19,460
-为了黑珍珠号  -你做了什么
- For the Pearl. - What have you done?

1254
01:56:23,010 --> 01:56:25,410
安琪莉卡  别碰  有毒
Angelica! Don't! It's poison!

1255
01:56:30,050 --> 01:56:32,380
不用一点恶毒的伎俩
I'm not such the fool to take on Blackbeard

1256
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:35,920
就想对付黑胡子  我还没这么天真
without a little venomous advantage.

1257
01:56:37,220 --> 01:56:38,710
杰克
Jack!

1258
01:56:50,540 --> 01:56:52,590
黑胡子的船和船员归我所有
I claim Blackbeard's ship and crew,

1259
01:56:52,740 --> 01:56:56,170
还有这把剑  以此补偿我失去的右腿
and this sword, payment for my missing limb!

1260
01:57:10,590 --> 01:57:11,990
抓紧  用力拉
Hang on! Pull!

1261
01:57:57,270 --> 01:57:59,630
别浪费我的眼泪
Do not waste my tear.

1262
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:31,230
喝了这个  这杯里有眼泪
Drink this. This one has the tear.

1263
01:58:31,370 --> 01:58:33,360
-你得喝另一杯  -不
- You must drink the other. - No!

1264
01:58:34,140 --> 01:58:37,370
你们只有一个能活  另一个必须牺牲
I cannot save you both. One of you must sacrifice.

1265
01:58:38,310 --> 01:58:41,400
喝了它  父亲  拯救你的灵魂
You take it, Father, for your soul.

1266
01:58:43,450 --> 01:58:48,890
提奇船长  她快死了  你得救你的女儿
Captain Teach, she's dying. You must save your daughter.

1267
01:58:50,050 --> 01:58:52,850
这一杯是夺走生命的吗
This one takes life?

1268
01:58:52,990 --> 01:58:54,860
这一杯有眼泪能赋予生命
This one has the tear and gives life?

1269
01:58:54,990 --> 01:58:56,250
对  快喝
Aye, hurry!

1270
01:59:05,170 --> 01:59:09,440
安琪莉卡  救我  孩子
Angelica... Save me, my child.

1271
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:12,780
不
No.

1272
01:59:21,490 --> 01:59:22,920
我爱你  父亲
I love you, Father.

1273
01:59:35,900 --> 01:59:37,530
等等
Wait a minute.

1274
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:42,540
事实上  好像弄反了
In fact, it might have been the other way around.

1275
01:59:43,370 --> 01:59:47,210
这一杯有眼泪  那一杯没有
This cup had the tear, that one had the other bit.

1276
01:59:47,310 --> 01:59:48,570
骗子
Trickster!

1277
01:59:48,710 --> 01:59:50,580
-恶魔  -父亲
- Devil! - Father!

1278
01:59:57,590 --> 01:59:59,110
你这混蛋  你怎么敢
You bastard! How could you?

1279
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:01,590
你父亲救了你
Your father saved you.

1280
02:00:01,730 --> 02:00:04,250
或许他的灵魂现在得到了救赎
Perhaps his soul is now redeemed, eh?

1281
02:01:05,060 --> 02:01:07,180
你受伤了
You are hurt.

1282
02:01:09,390 --> 02:01:11,330
只是身体受伤
In body only.

1283
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:17,230
我的心灵很平静...因为你
My mind is at peace... because of you.

1284
02:01:18,300 --> 02:01:21,170
-我  -对
- Me? - Yes.

1285
02:01:22,170 --> 02:01:24,570
我曾迷失了自己
I was lost.

1286
02:01:25,540 --> 02:01:30,210
那狂风大浪
The wind, the tides...

1287
02:01:30,350 --> 02:01:33,410
应该能改变一个人的信仰
...they ought to renew a man's faith.

1288
02:01:34,990 --> 02:01:36,920
但对我而言  只有你能
But for me, only you.

1289
02:01:37,820 --> 02:01:41,550
菲利普  我可以救你
Philip, I can save you.

1290
02:01:41,690 --> 02:01:44,660
你只需开口请求我
You need only ask.

1291
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:50,900
-我只求你一件事  -什么
- I seek but one thing. - What is that?

1292
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:54,270
宽恕
Forgiveness.

1293
02:01:54,410 --> 02:01:57,740
如果不是我  你就不会被抓
If not for me, you would never have been captured.

1294
02:01:57,880 --> 02:01:59,540
开口吧
Ask.

1295
02:02:01,410 --> 02:02:03,240
宽恕我
Forgive me?

1296
02:02:28,370 --> 02:02:29,600
我恨你
I hate you.

1297
02:02:29,740 --> 02:02:32,070
恨那个救了你的人吗
The bloke who saved your life?

1298
02:02:32,210 --> 02:02:35,410
我的生命是从我父亲那偷来的
The years I possess, stolen from my own father!

1299
02:02:35,550 --> 02:02:38,570
我只是帮黑胡子尽了父亲的责任
I only helped Blackbeard do what any father should have done.

1300
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:41,910
你个冷血自大的混蛋
You are cruel and ignorant.

1301
02:02:45,620 --> 02:02:49,420
一把手枪  一枚子弹
One pistol, one shot.

1302
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:51,790
好让我在饿死前饮弹自尽吗
To kill myself before I starve?

1303
02:02:51,930 --> 02:02:53,490
我可不信你会这么做  宝贝
There's no trusting you, love.

1304
02:02:53,630 --> 02:02:56,100
再说了  这里船只来往频繁
Besides, this is a well-traveled trade route.

1305
02:02:56,230 --> 02:02:57,830
你可以向它们发送求救信号
You can signal a passing ship.

1306
02:02:57,970 --> 02:03:01,430
或者像俗语说的那样啃啃子弹
Or you can just bite the proverbial bullet, as it were.

1307
02:02:57,970 --> 02:03:01,430
喻指咬紧牙关  忍受苦难的现实

1308
02:03:01,570 --> 02:03:03,160
我怎么才能弄开这些绳子
And how will I get free of these bonds?

1309
02:03:03,310 --> 02:03:06,070
半小时前你就挣开了
You broke free of your bonds half an hour ago,

1310
02:03:06,180 --> 02:03:09,010
等待袭击的最佳时刻
waiting for the precise moment to pounce.

1311
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:13,410
承认吧  杰克
Admit it, Jack.

1312
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:17,450
-你还爱着我  -如果你有个妹妹和一条狗
- You still love me. - If you had a sister and a dog,

1313
02:03:17,590 --> 02:03:19,890
我会选择狗
I'd choose the dog.

1314
02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:23,420
宝藏  有个装满珠宝的箱子
Treasure! There is a chest with jewels!

1315
02:03:23,530 --> 02:03:25,790
拥有征服风浪力量的珠宝
Jewels with the power to rule the wind and tide!

1316
02:03:25,930 --> 02:03:29,020
-你编的吧  -等等
- You're making that up! - Wait...

1317
02:03:29,830 --> 02:03:33,530
我有身孕了  你的
I am with child. Yours.

1318
02:03:34,770 --> 02:03:36,170
我不记得我们有过...
I don't recall that we ever had...

1319
02:03:36,310 --> 02:03:39,040
-你当时醉了  -我从没醉到那种程度
- You were drunk! - I've actually never been that drunk.

1320
02:03:39,180 --> 02:03:40,300
等等
Wait!

1321
02:03:42,180 --> 02:03:44,240
我有件事要告诉你
There is something I want to say to you.

1322
02:03:44,420 --> 02:03:48,580
我们第一次相见时我就想说了
Something I wanted to say from the moment we first met.

1323
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:50,650
那就说吧
Go on, then.

1324
02:03:52,990 --> 02:03:54,320
我爱你
I love you.

1325
02:03:57,900 --> 02:03:59,730
我也是
As do I.

1326
02:03:59,860 --> 02:04:03,320
以前爱  今后也爱
Always have. Always will.

1327
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:09,330
我得走了
I gotta go.

1328
02:04:09,470 --> 02:04:10,500
杰克
Jack!

1329
02:04:12,810 --> 02:04:14,400
这事没完
This is not over!

1330
02:04:15,480 --> 02:04:16,540
杰克
Jack!

1331
02:04:26,120 --> 02:04:27,610
没打中
Missed!

1332
02:04:42,910 --> 02:04:45,930
复仇号是我的了[同时意为复了仇]
The Revenge is mine.

1333
02:04:52,620 --> 02:04:54,080
先生
Sir...

1334
02:04:56,550 --> 02:04:58,420
我们在甲板下发现了这个
We found this below decks.

1335
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:26,780
全员  开往上风向
All hands! Ply to windward!

1336
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:30,480
动起来  你们这群蟑螂
Get cracking, ye blooming cockroaches!

1337
02:05:33,190 --> 02:05:35,780
国王是对我不错
The Crown served me well.

1338
02:05:35,930 --> 02:05:38,920
但如今  大海蓝天诸神在上
But now, by the gods of sea and sky...

1339
02:05:39,060 --> 02:05:43,160
向托尔图加岛开进吧
...make way for Tortuga!

1340
02:05:54,280 --> 02:05:57,440
吉布斯  你这肮脏糊涂的老东西居然成功了
Gibbs, you filthy, besotted shellback, you made it!

1341
02:05:57,580 --> 02:05:59,140
是的
Aye!

1342
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:00,880
我相信在这次的联盟中
And I trust we managed a profit

1343
02:06:01,020 --> 02:06:05,180
-我们有所获利  -请大饱眼福吧
- from our joint enterprise? - Feast your eyes.

1344
02:06:10,260 --> 02:06:12,790
指南针直接领我找到了它
The compass led me straight and true.

1345
02:06:12,930 --> 02:06:14,920
你怎么对付黑胡子船上的看守
What of Blackbeard's men guarding the ship?

1346
02:06:15,030 --> 02:06:18,930
我用了在新几内亚大获成功的那个办法
I employed the selfsame maneuver we perfected in New Guinea.

1347
02:06:19,040 --> 02:06:23,130
如果留下一整只舰队不拿就太可惜了
Seemed a shame to leave an entire fleet behind.

1348
02:06:23,270 --> 02:06:25,330
确实可惜
Shame indeed.

1349
02:06:37,290 --> 02:06:38,650
我恨那只猴子
I hate that monkey.

1350
02:06:38,790 --> 02:06:42,230
黑珍珠号要怎么弄出来
So, the Pearl... Any idea how to get her out?

1351
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:45,390
我们需要一把弩  一个沙漏  三只山羊
We shall need a crossbow, an hourglass, three goats.

1352
02:06:45,530 --> 02:06:46,620
我们中的一个
One of us must learn to play

1353
02:06:46,620 --> 02:06:48,560
得学会吹小号  另一个得这样
the trumpet whilst the other one goes like this...

1354
02:06:49,070 --> 02:06:52,370
-我认识个人有山羊  -很好  那我可以这样
- I know a man with a goat. - Good. I can go like this.

1355
02:06:55,010 --> 02:06:56,670
杰克  我想问问
Jack, I have to ask...

1356
02:06:56,810 --> 02:06:59,670
你有了圣杯  泉水还有眼泪
You had the chalices, the water, the tear...

1357
02:06:59,810 --> 02:07:02,340
你大概能长命百岁
You could have lived maybe forever.

1358
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:04,450
不老泉会考验你  吉布斯
The Fountain does test you, Gibbs.

1359
02:07:04,620 --> 02:07:07,520
但最好还是别知道何时是生命的尽头
But better to not know which moment may be your last.

1360
02:07:07,650 --> 02:07:09,680
在生命中的每个瞬间
Every morsel of your entire being

1361
02:07:09,820 --> 02:07:12,910
都能感受到生命本身无限的奥秘
alive to the infinite mystery of it all.

1362
02:07:13,060 --> 02:07:15,580
再说  谁说我不会长命百岁
And who's to say I won't live forever, eh?

1363
02:07:15,730 --> 02:07:18,850
不老泉的发现者
Discoverer of the Fountain of Youth.

1364
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,900
这事我说不了算  吉布斯
I have no say in it, Gibbs.

1365
02:07:22,030 --> 02:07:24,020
我注定是个海盗
It's a pirate's life for me.

1366
02:07:24,970 --> 02:07:26,460
懂了吗
Savvy?
