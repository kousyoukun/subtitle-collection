00:01:15,226 --> 00:01:17,570
船長！
Captain！

2
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,460
你究竟是誰？
Who are you？

加地斯，西班牙

4
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,646
這是怎麼回事？
What is this？

5
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:36,454
國王陛下，他是被漁網撈上來的
Your Majesty，caught him up in a fishing net. 

6
00:02:36,786 --> 00:02:37,454
一個漁網
A fishing net. 

7
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:38,855
陛下，他一直在講故事
Sire，he's been telling stories. 

8
00:02:38,856 --> 00:02:39,524
故事說...

00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,460
我們相信他找到了...
We believe he's found a...

10
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,369
龐塞德萊昂
Ponce de Leon. 

11
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,973
說他找到龐塞德萊昂的船了
Says he found Ponce de Leon's ship. 

12
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,410
或是搭過那艘船
Or sailed on it. 

13
00:02:57,412 --> 00:02:58,843
不，我跟你說過
No，I told you，

14
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,243
龐塞德萊昂死於兩百年前
Ponce de Leon died 200 years ago. 

15
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:04,908
但他死於尋找某樣東西，對吧？
Aye，but he died searching for something，didn't he？

16
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,216
青春之泉
The Fountain of Youth. 

17
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,090
你航行可以多快？
How soon can you sail？

18
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,524
順著海水潮汐
With the tide. 

19
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:32,449
神鬼奇航 4：幽靈海

20
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,778
在這裡！幸運石楠！
Over here！Lucky heather！

21
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,000
倫敦，英格蘭

22
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,987
海盜劍，海盜劍
Pirate swords！Pirate swords！

23
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,923
海盜今天絞刑

24
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:45,690
快來看他吊死！

25
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,557
海盜木偶！
Pirate puppets！

26
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,218
接招！
Take that，you！

27
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,295
爸爸，快點，不然看不到絞刑！
Hurry，Papa，or we'll miss the hanging！

28
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,145
不是絞刑，寶貝，是審訊
It's not a hanging，dear，it's a trial. 

29
00:03:53,147 --> 00:03:54,994
今天下午才是絞刑

30
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,795
海盜今天被絞死！

00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,639
起來，快點
Come on. Up you get. 

32
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,539
海盜，向前走
Move along，pirate. 

33
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,078
還是我應該說「海盜船長」？
Or should I say，「Captain Pirate」？

34
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,583
快點，走吧，往上走
Come on. Come on！Up you go.

肅靜！秩序！

36
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,321
肅靜！
Quiet！

37
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,921
現在出庭的是
Now appearing before the court，

38
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:23,427
惡名昭彰，臭名狼藉
the notorious and infamous pirate，pillager，

39
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,196
而且無惡不作的...

40
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:24,962
安靜！
Quiet！

41
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,659
...傑克史派洛船長！
...Captain Jack Sparrow！

42
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,737
我跟你們說過，我叫吉卜！
I told you，the name's Gibbs！

43
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,572
賈夏密吉卜！
Joshamee Gibbs！

44
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:35,555
要說幾次...
How many times...

45
00:04:35,557 --> 00:04:36,540
注意，注意！
Hear ye，hear ye！

46
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:37,975
主持這次審判
Presiding over these trials，

47
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:39,907
全體起立
all rise and attend，

48
00:04:39,907 --> 00:04:43,609
尊敬的史密斯法官
the Right Honorable Justice Smith！

49
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,159
尊敬的閣下
My dear sir. 

50
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,128
肅靜！
Quiet！

51
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,692
現在...
Now...

52
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,072
...我們在這裡做什麼？
...what do we have here？

53
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,537
傑克？
Jack？

54
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,165
閉嘴！
Shut up！

55
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:11,977
我不認識他
I don't recognize him. 

56
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,708
沒有必要
Not necessary. 

57
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,446
你要說什麼？
You were saying？

58
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,076
我不是傑克史派洛
Jack Sparrow is not my name. 

59
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,151
我是賈夏密吉卜
My name is Joshamee Gibbs. 

60
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,015
是這樣嗎？
Is that so？

61
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,655
這裡說你是傑克史派洛
It says Jack Sparrow here. 

62
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,323
我跟他們說過
I told 'em. 

63
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,973
我不是傑克史派洛
I'm not Jack Sparrow，

64
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:28,620
如果有助於我的案子
who I would be happy to identify to the court

65
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,145
我很樂意當庭指認
if it would help my case. 

66
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:31,662
這是拙劣的狡辯
I think that would be a poor defense，

67
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,012
除非你想要再挨棍子
unless you want to be bludgeoned again 

68
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:34,360
像格陵蘭海豹一樣
like a harp seal. 

69
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,534
犯人聲稱
The prisoner claims of being innocent 

70
00:05:37,535 --> 00:05:38,998
他不是傑克史派洛
to being Jack Sparrow. 

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,898
你們怎麼判決？
How do you find？

72
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,169
不審判？
No trial？

73
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,439
不是該審查證據...
But aren't we here to examine the evidence...

74
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,734
陪審長，他有罪嗎？
Foreman，your finding. Guilty？

75
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,743
有罪意味著他會被絞死
Guilty verdict means he'll hang. 

76
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,529
絞死他！
Hang him！

77
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,575
把他吊起來！
String him up！

78
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,366
有罪？
Guilty？

79
00:05:55,368 --> 00:05:56,379
這不公平！
That's not fair！

80
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,750
閉嘴
Shut it. 

81
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,960
賈夏密吉卜
Joshamee Gibbs，

82
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:02,960
你被當成是傑克史派洛
the crime of which you've been found guilty of

83
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:06,430
被判有罪是無罪的
is being innocent of being Jack Sparrow. 

84
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:09,768
我在此改判你無期徒刑
I hereby commute your sentence，

85
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,168
待在監獄裡
and order that you be imprisoned

86
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,654
度過你悲慘
for the remainder of your miserable，

87
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:14,137
垂死無助的餘生
moribund，mutton-chopped life. 

88
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,140
什麼？
What？！

89
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:16,107
絞死他！
Hang him！

90
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:16,839
絞死他！
Hang him！

91
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:17,436
定讞
There. 

92
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,559
胡言亂語！
Balderdash！

93
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:20,251
把他吊起來！
String him up！

94
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:20,941
絞死他！
Hang him high！

95
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:23,913
安排馬車
Means shall be arranged 

96
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:25,244
移送這名犯人
to transport this prisoner

97
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,410
到倫敦塔
to the Tower of London. 

98
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,231
感激不盡
Thanks very much. 

99
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:45,798
謝啦
Ta. 

100
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,923
快點
Come on. 

101
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:52,237
上車
Get up there. 

102
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,377
上去！
Get up！

103
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,822
這下好了
Hell's teeth. 

104
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:04,822
我們都進監獄了
Now we're both headed for prison. 

105
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,250
不用擔心
Not to worry. 

106
00:07:06,252 --> 00:07:07,691
我賄賂了車伕
I've paid off the driver. 

107
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,297
十分鐘後，我們會在倫敦城外
Ten minutes，we'll be outside London Town， 

108
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:11,163
有馬匹等著
horses waiting.

109
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,831
今晚，騎到海邊
Tonight，we make the coast. 

110
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,198
然後就是找一艘船的事了
Then it's just a matter of finding a ship. 

111
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,070
一切都在計劃中，是吧？
All part of the plan，yes？

112
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:19,271
沒說錯
Exactly. 

113
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,372
今天一早我就來到倫敦城
I arrived in London Town just this morning

114
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,008
要從絞刑架
to rescue one Joshamee Gibbs 

115
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,642
救出賈夏密吉卜
from one appointment with the gallows. 

116
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,577
看到你還活著
Seeing as how you're still alive，

117
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,980
我會說到現在為止計畫很成功
I'd say it's all been very successful thus far.

118
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,315
吉卜，你出什麼事了？
What happened to you，Gibbs？

119
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,684
我以為你在別處工作
I thought you were employed elsewhere 

120
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,051
或忙其他的
or otherwise engaged. 

121
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,854
是啊，但我一直偷偷打聽
Aye. But I always listened like a thief 

122
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,655
鬼盜船的消息
for news of the Black Pearl. 

123
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,257
但沒有人知道她停靠在哪個港口
Nobody's seen where she might next make port. 

124
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,461
然後，我聽到傳聞：
Then，I hear a rumor:

125
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,279
傑克史派洛帶著船來倫敦
Jack Sparrow's in London with a ship 

126
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,097
正在尋找船員
and looking for a crew. 

127
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,012
哪有
Am not. 

128
00:07:47,014 --> 00:07:47,926
我聽到的就是這些
But that's what I heard. 

129
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:49,131
事實是
Fact is，

130
00:07:49,132 --> 00:07:50,334
你今晚要簽約僱用船員
you're signing up men tonight. 

131
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,002
酒吧名字叫「船長的女兒」
Pub called The Captain's Daughter. 

132
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,698
哪有
Am not！

133
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,406
是呀，我想這有點古怪
Well，I thought it a bit odd，

134
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:59,977
但是，你從不是最可預測的人
but then，you've never been the most predictable of sorts. 

135
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,412
告訴我
Tell me something. 

136
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,248
有另一個傑克史派洛
There is another Jack Sparrow 

137
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,082
在招搖撞騙？
out there sullying my good name？

138
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,218
冒牌貨
An impostor.

139
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,351
沒錯
Indeed. 

140
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,288
不過...
But...

141
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,222
是有一艘船的冒牌貨
an impostor with a ship. 

142
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,958
而且需要船員
And in need of a crew. 

143
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,994
正巧，我也需要
Which，as fate would have it，so am I. 

144
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,762
傑克，那你呢？
What about you，Jack？

145
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:19,988
上次我聽說
Last I heard，

146
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,766
你拚命尋找青春之泉
you were hell-bentto find the Fountain of Youth. 

147
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,258
找到了？
Any luck？

148
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,440
發生要求有敏銳的洞察力
Circumstances arose and forced a compelling insight

149
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,542
關於謹慎以及勇氣的情況
regarding discretion and valor. 

150
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,108
意思是，你放棄了
Meaning，you gave up. 

151
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,672
我沒有
I did not. 

152
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,298
我就和以前一樣堅定
I am just as bent as ever. 

153
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,781
非常堅定
Hellishly so. 

154
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,504
我會喝到青春之泉的，吉卜先生
I shall taste those waters，Master Gibbs. 

155
00:08:40,506 --> 00:08:42,584
記住我的話
Mark my words. 

156
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,382
哦，這麼快就到啦
Short trip. 

157
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,362
一切都在計劃中，是吧？
All part of the plan，yes？

158
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:02,565
不是
No. 

159
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:34,059
你就是傑克史派洛？
You are Jack Sparrow？

160
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,928
你忘了加上「船長」
There should be a「Captain」in there somewhere. 

161
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,461
我聽說過你
I've heard of you. 

162
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,664
想必你知道我是誰
And you know who I am. 

163
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:43,972
很面熟
Face is familiar. 

164
00:10:43,974 --> 00:10:45,269
我有恐嚇過你？
Have I threatened you before？

165
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,362
在你面前的是
You are in the presence of 

166
00:10:46,363 --> 00:10:47,346
喬治奧古斯汀
George Augustus，

167
00:10:47,348 --> 00:10:49,313
伯倫瑞克-呂訥堡公爵
Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg，

168
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,816
神聖羅馬帝國的
Archtreasurer and Prince-elector  

169
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,316
財務大臣和王子選侯
of the Holy Roman Empire，

170
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,419
英國和愛爾蘭的國王
King of Great Britain and Ireland，

171
00:10:54,418 --> 00:10:55,719
你的國王
and of you. 

172
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,440
沒聽說過
Doesn't ring a bell. 

173
00:10:58,442 --> 00:10:59,690
我聽說
I am informed

174
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,922
你是來倫敦
you have come to London to procure 

175
00:11:01,923 --> 00:11:04,152
招募船員
a crew for your ship. 

176
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,431
邪惡的謠言，並非事實
Vicious rumor. Not true. 

177
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,216
那你自稱傑克史派洛
Then you lied to me when you told me 

178
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:09,833
就是騙我咯
you were Jack Sparrow.

179
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,519
我是傑克史派洛
I am Jack Sparrow，

180
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:13,203
但我沒有招募船員
but I'm not here to procure a crew. 

181
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,006
那是...
That is...

182
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,807
另一個人
someone else. 

183
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:21,045
另一個叫傑克史派洛的人
Someone else named Jack Sparrow. 

184
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,242
你們給我找錯人了
You've brought me the wrong wastrel. 

185
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,032
找到真的
Find the proper one 

186
00:11:25,034 --> 00:11:26,681
然後解決這個冒牌貨
and dispose of this impostor. 

187
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:27,849
不，等等
No，wait，wait，wait. 

188
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,878
等一下
Hang on a minute. 

189
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,221
我是傑克史派洛
I'm Jack Sparrow，

190
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,421
獨一無二
the one and only. 

191
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:33,252
而且我在倫敦
And I am in London. 

192
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,451
招募船員
To procure a crew. 

193
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,323
準備啟航
To undertake a voyage

194
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,165
前往青春之泉...
to the Fountain...

195
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:38,897
你說什麼？
What？

196
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,312
誰來拿掉那些
Will someone please remove these 

197
00:11:41,313 --> 00:11:43,593
討厭的鎖鏈？
infernal chains？

198
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:44,896
來，來
Come，come. 

199
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,773
我們知道你有一張地圖
We know you're in possession of a map. 

200
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,491
沒收地圖
So confiscate the map，

201
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:53,072
然後絞死他
and to the gallows with him！

202
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,077
你有地圖嗎？
Have you a map？

203
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:01,536
沒有
No. 

204
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:02,586
地圖在哪？
Where is it？

205
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,437
真相嗎？
The truth？

206
00:12:04,438 --> 00:12:06,285
我弄丟了
I lost it. 

207
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,493
剛剛才弄丟的
Quite recently，in fact. 

208
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,561
我收到一個情報
I have a report. 

209
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,158
西班牙人找到青春之泉了
The Spanish have located the Fountain of Youth. 

210
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:19,430
我不會讓憂鬱的西班牙國王
I will not have some melancholy Spanish monarch，

211
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,870
一個天主教徒
a Catholic，

212
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:24,168
獲得永生！
gain eternal life！

213
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,712
你知道青春之泉怎麼去嗎？
You do know the way to the Fountain？

214
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:29,965
當然知道
Of course I do. 

215
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:31,115
那我看
Look at me. 

216
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,982
你可以率領探險隊
You could guide an expedition. 

217
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,647
陛下，如果您允許的話
With your permission，your heinie，

218
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,900
您會提供
you will be providing，then，

219
00:12:38,901 --> 00:12:40,190
一艘船...
a ship...

220
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,459
...和船員？
...and a crew？

221
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,121
還有一位船長
And a captain. 

222
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,977
午安，陛下
Afternoon，sire. 

223
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,418
恕我大膽
If I may be so bold，

224
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,352
為什麼那個人沒上鎖鏈？
why is that man not in chains？

225
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,422
請立刻給他上鎖鏈
He must be manacled at once. 

226
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,339
就在我的皇宮？
At the center of my palace？

227
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,153
想都別想
Hardly. 

228
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,455
老巴
Hector. 

229
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:21,088
多麼高興看到一個海盜改邪歸正
How nice to see a fellow pirate make good of himself. 

230
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,782
海盜？不對
Pirate？Nay. 

231
00:13:22,783 --> 00:13:24,363
是私掠船
Privateer. 

232
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:27,302
在吾王權威和保護下
On a sanctioned mission under the authority

233
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:30,100
進行官方批准的任務
and protection of the Crown. 

234
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,701
就算是，但首先
As may be，but first，

235
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,041
我的寶貝鬼盜船呢？
what has become of my beloved Pearl？

236
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:39,310
我失去鬼盜船也失去一條腿
I lost the Pearl as I lost my leg. 

237
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:40,600
失去鬼盜船？
Lost the Pearl？

238
00:13:40,602 --> 00:13:41,715
對
Aye. 

239
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,822
雖然我努力保衛她
I defended her mightily enough，

240
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,790
但她仍然沉入海底
but she be sunk nonetheless. 

241
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,160
如果那艘船沉入海底
If that ship be sunk properly，

242
00:13:54,162 --> 00:13:56,033
那麼船長就該和她一起
you should be sunk with it. 

243
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,061
巴船長
Captain Barbossa，

244
00:13:57,062 --> 00:13:58,687
我們每拖延一秒
each second we tarry，

245
00:13:58,688 --> 00:14:01,337
西班牙佬就把我們拋得老遠
the Spanish outdistance us. 

246
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,191
我有信心
I have every confidence 

247
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:04,909
你會獲勝
you will prevail 

248
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,210
並獲得爵位獎賞
and be rewarded with the high station

249
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:07,376
正如你想要的
you so desire. 

250
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,897
陛下，能為您服務就夠了
To serve doth suffice，sire. 

251
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:11,090
你喔
You，sir，

252
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:12,280
墮落了
have stooped. 

253
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,751
我們的砂時計幾乎要漏完了
Jack，our sands be all but run. 

254
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:19,221
何不加入贏家的行列？
Where's the harmin joining the winning side？

255
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:23,158
而且你會認識王公貴族
And you do meeta nicer class of person. 

256
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,696
我一切都明白
I understand everything. 

257
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,397
除了你為什麼要戴假髮
Except that wig. 

258
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,337
他就要逃走了！
He's getting away！

259
00:14:36,338 --> 00:14:37,867
攔住他！
Stop him！

260
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,808
攔住他！
Head him off！

261
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,605
不！攔住這個海盜！
No！Stop that pirate！

262
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,593
下來！
Come down！

263
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,565
他逃走了？
He escaped？

264
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:18,283
陛下，他逃不出我的手心
Leave it to me，sire. 

265
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,123
守衛！
Guards！Guards！

266
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,166
武器準備好了！
Arms at ready！

267
00:15:51,168 --> 00:15:52,383
是，長官！
Aye，sir！

268
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,917
找到他！
Find him！

269
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,612
誰撿到的就歸誰！
Finders keepers！

270
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:25,979
在那堙I
There！

271
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,772
就這樣放過我啊？
Is that it？

272
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,445
停車！攔住馬車！
Halt！Stop that carriage！

273
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:58,878
攔住他！
Head him off！

274
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,520
讓開！
Out of the way！

275
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,550
攔住那個海盜！
Stop that pirate！

276
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,250
讓開！
Move out of the way！

277
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,229
攔住那個傢伙！
Stop that man！

278
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,898
別讓他逃了！
Don't let him get away！

279
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,144
開槍！
Fire！

280
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:31,865
他快逃走了！
He's getting away！

281
00:18:31,866 --> 00:18:32,822
追他！
After him！

282
00:18:32,823 --> 00:18:33,776
攔住他！
Stop him！

283
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,646
追他！
After him！

284
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,425
邪惡的海盜
Filthy pirate. 

285
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,672
嗨，小傑
Hello，Jackie. 

286
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,869
嗨，老爸
Hello，Dad. 

287
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,483
我聽說你在招募船員
I heard you're putting together a crew. 

288
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,491
真是人言可畏啊
If enough people keep saying it，it must be true. 

289
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,391
我聽說你要率領探險隊去青春之泉
I heard where you're headed The Fountain. 

290
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,020
你去過那裡？
Have you been there？

291
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:30,196
這張臉像去過？
Does this face look like it's been to the Fountain of Youth？

292
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,236
這媬O光不太好
Depends on the light. 

293
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:34,834
孩子，要找到青春之泉
Son，the Fountain. 

294
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:38,807
必須有異教儀式用的東西
There'll be items required for the profane ritual. 

295
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,572
兩個聖盃
Two chalices. 

296
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,066
在地圖上有一個聖盃
On the map there was a chalice. 

297
00:19:43,068 --> 00:19:44,747
兩個，銀製的
Two，silver. 

298
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,320
在龐塞德萊昂船上
From the Ponce de Leon ship. 

299
00:19:46,322 --> 00:19:47,750
兩個你都要
You'll need both. 

300
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:48,900
做什麼？
For？

301
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:50,278
儀式
The ritual. 

302
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,655
小傑，不要當笨蛋
Don't be a fool，Jackie. 

303
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,717
啟航前要瞭解每個細節
Find out every detail before you set sail. 

304
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,725
哦，啟航，我也很想
Oh，set sail. Love to. 

305
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,977
但對於這點
But for that，

306
00:19:57,978 --> 00:19:59,092
我可能需要一艘船
I may need a ship. 

307
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,881
在那邊的那些傢伙
Those folk，over there，

308
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:02,530
他們有一艘船
they have a ship. 

309
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,228
他們現在正和水手們簽約
They're signing up sailors right now. 

310
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,565
<i>我的心被愛神一箭射中</i>
<i>My heart is pierced by Cupid</i>

311
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,697
<i>黃金在我眼中變成糞土</i>
<i>I disdain all glittering gold</i>

312
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,207
小傑，還有最後一件事
And one last thing，Jackie. 

313
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,523
青春之泉是一個考驗
The Fountain will test you. 

314
00:20:15,525 --> 00:20:16,912
記住我的話
Mark my words. 

315
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,380
<i>我的心被愛神一箭射中</i>
<i>My heart is pierced by Cupid</i>

316
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,451
<i>黃金在我眼中變成糞土</i>
<i>I disdain all glittering gold</i>

317
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,316
<i>從此沒有什麼能安慰我</i>
<i>There is nothing can console me</i>

318
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:26,082
<i>除了那個快樂勇敢的水手</i>
<i>But my jolly sailor bold</i>

319
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,434
我聽說你們在招募船員
I hear you be recruiting a crew. 

320
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,632
對，沒錯
Aye. That is，

321
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:47,575
傑克史派洛正在召募船員
Jack Sparrow be putting together a modest venture. 

322
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,781
你好大膽，是不是？
You got some nerve，ain't ya？

323
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,455
竟敢穿成這樣在這堨X現？
Turning up here dressed like that？

324
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,443
你是什麼東西，冒牌貨？
What are you，some kind of impostor？

325
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,782
你看不出來我是誰？
Have you any idea who I am，mate？

326
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,591
喂，朋友們！
Oi，muckers！

327
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,321
這傢伙忘記自己的名字了！
There's a bloke here what's forgotten his own name！

328
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,362
大夥們，我要跟史派洛一起出航了
Lads，I'm sailing with Sparrow. 

329
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:11,297
誰願意請一名水手喝一杯？
Who'll buy a sailor a drink？

330
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:14,929
下一個是誰？
Who's next？

331
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,442
給我們多來一些
Bring us some more of those ones. 

332
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,780
再來四份
Yeah，make it four. 

333
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,310
你冒充我
You've stolen me，

334
00:21:39,312 --> 00:21:41,358
我要揭穿你
and I'm here to take meself back. 

335
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,165
停止這樣做
Stop doing that. 

336
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,123
世界上冒充我能這麼像的只有一個人
Only one person alive knows that move. 

337
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,996
我一直想這樣做
Always wanted to do that. 

338
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,734
嗨，安潔莉卡
Hello，Angelica. 

339
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,062
嗨，傑克
Hello，Jack. 

340
00:24:08,064 --> 00:24:10,013
令你印象深刻吧？
Are you impressed？

341
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:13,345
有一次或兩次我幾乎殺了你
I think I almost killed you once or twice there. 

342
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:17,546
這最真誠的奉承讓我好感動
I'm touched at this most sincerest form of flattery. 

343
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,220
但是為什麼？
But why？

344
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:24,021
你是我唯一能冒充的海盜
You were the only pirate I thought I would pass for. 

345
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,891
這不是恭維
That is not a compliment. 

346
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,165
傑克，放心
Don't worry，Jack. 

347
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:31,996
我早就原諒你了
I forgave you a long time ago. 

348
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,454
為了什麼？
For what？

349
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:34,770
因為我甩了妳？
For leaving you？

350
00:24:34,772 --> 00:24:37,402
回想一下吧，是我甩了你
Recall that I left you. 

351
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:41,344
一個紳士不會介意女士的幻想
A gentleman allows a lady to maintain her fictions. 

352
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,000
史派洛，聽著
Look，Sparrow. 

353
00:24:43,002 --> 00:24:45,007
我的水手們只要有錢拿
As long as my sailors get their money，

354
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,235
他們就願意忍受各種
they're willing to put up with any number of 

355
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,320
怪癖
peculiarities.

356
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:53,018
有一個怪癖我就無法忍受
There is one peculiarity with which I will not put up with. 

357
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,718
冒充我就該是「傑克史派洛船長」
I will be impersonated as「Captain」. Nothing less. 

358
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,887
當船長還不簡單，只要有一艘船
Well，for that，you need a ship，

359
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,521
而結果是，我就有一艘
and as it turns out，I have one. 

360
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,401
我可以用這艘船
I could use a ship. 

361
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,266
我聽說你去過青春之泉
I hear tell you've been to the Fountain. 

362
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,566
最近幾天道聽途說真多
There be a lot of hear-telling going on these days. 

363
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,236
青春之泉
The Fountain of Youth. 

364
00:25:11,238 --> 00:25:14,236
親愛的安潔莉卡，別擔憂
Dearest Angelica，fret not. 

365
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:17,143
妳還要好幾年才用得著
You still have a few usable years left. 

366
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,610
總是那麼會說話
Always so charming. 

367
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:21,877
你還是沒回答我
You didn't answer me. 

368
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,300
關於青春之泉
Aye. Regarding the Fountain. 

369
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:24,580
浪費時間，真的...
Waste of time，really...

370
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,628
夫人，我看到像皇家海軍的傢伙進來了
Milady，I see unseamanlike fellows of an officious-looking nature. 

371
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:31,155
卑鄙的海盜！找到他們！一群蛆！
Wretched pirates！Find 'em！Maggots！

372
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,527
你的朋友？
Friends of yours？

373
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:39,296
我可能無意中得罪了國王或其他
I may have unintentionally slighted some king or other. 

374
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,234
開門！
Open it！

375
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,704
你真的是一點都沒變
Yeah，you haven't changed. 

376
00:25:42,706 --> 00:25:44,035
是說我需要改變？
Implying the need？

377
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:45,540
是的
Yes. 

378
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,372
快開門，奉國王陛下之名
Open this door，in the name of His Majesty. 

379
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:48,635
你背棄了我
You betrayed me. 

380
00:25:48,637 --> 00:25:50,879
誘惑了我，還利用了我
You seduced me and you used me. 

381
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,745
我當時還是個小姑娘
I was innocent of the ways of men. 

382
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,534
我記得妳還是個
You demonstrated a lot of technique  

383
00:25:54,535 --> 00:25:56,183
很多花招的小姑娘
for someone I supposedly corrupted. 

384
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:57,686
快走啊
Imminent danger. 

385
00:25:57,688 --> 00:25:59,086
這堙A快，夫人！
Here，now，milady！

386
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,851
開門！
Open it！

387
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:03,300
我原本是去修道院要當修女的
I was ready to take my vows. 

388
00:26:03,302 --> 00:26:04,553
而你...
And you...

389
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:07,324
你去西班牙女修道院找我幹嘛？
What were you doing in a Spanish convent，anyway？

390
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,864
我弄錯了以為是妓院
Mistook it for a brothel. 

391
00:26:08,866 --> 00:26:10,229
走錯門了
Honest mistake. 

392
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:14,989
他在這
There he is！

393
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:15,799
在那
Over there！

394
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:36,159
我們處於不利地位
We are at a disadvantage. 

395
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:37,695
是說妳自己吧
Speak for yourself. 

396
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:39,695
哪像某人只會冒充我
Unlike some who pretend to be，

397
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,627
卻沒有我厲害
but cannot，in fact，hold a candle to，

398
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,233
我才是傑克史派洛船長
I am Captain Jack Sparrow. 

399
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,998
妳怎麼能說我利用了妳？
How can you say I used you？

400
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,336
你明白的很
You know exactly how. 

401
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,605
我知道，但妳怎麼能這麼說？
I know，but how can you say it？

402
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:34,997
怎麼回事？
So，what is it？

403
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:36,743
什麼怎麼回事？
What is what？

404
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:38,411
青春之泉啊
About the Fountain. 

405
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,050
你都知道什麼？
What do you know？

406
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,621
妳不會是恰好有
You don't happen to be in possession

407
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,995
龐塞德萊昂的兩隻銀杯吧？
of two silver chalices，circa Ponce de Leon？

408
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:50,634
沒有
No. 

409
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:51,566
我想也沒有
Thought not. 

410
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,517
為什麼？
Why？

411
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,332
我聽到一些說法
I hear stories. 

412
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,304
謠傳
Rumors. 

413
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,570
妳一定知道那個儀式
You are，of course，aware of the ritual. 

414
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:01,637
對，我知道
Yes，I am. 

415
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,347
是什麼儀式？
What is it？

416
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:06,712
需要什麼？
What is required？

417
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:13,313
一隻人魚，傑克
A mermaid，Jack. 

418
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,698
你們搞錯了
There's been a mistake. 

419
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,010
是無期徒刑
It's a life sentence，

420
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,229
不是死刑
not death. 

421
00:28:25,361 --> 00:28:26,361
是無期！
Life！

422
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:33,442
巴船長
Barbossa. 

423
00:28:33,444 --> 00:28:35,109
各位，謝謝你們
Thank you，gentlemen. 

424
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:38,238
我想你會綁絞繩吧
I trust you can tie a noose. 

425
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,782
這是很困難的事
That's a hard thing，

426
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,910
逼一個人綁自己的絞繩
forcing a man to twis this own hanging rope. 

427
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:46,588
你必須為你的行為付出代價
You must lie in your bed the way you made it. 

428
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:49,791
你是怎麼了？
What's happened to you？

429
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,646
傑克史派洛呢？
Where be Jack Sparrow？

430
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:53,364
他逃走了
He escaped. 

431
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,932
吉卜，我在趕時間
I'm on a tight schedule，Gibbs. 

432
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,432
天佑號天一亮就啟航
The HMS Providence sets sail at first light. 

433
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,730
如果你不想屍體被吊在這裡
If you do not care to watch it hanging here dead，

434
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,896
滿嘴都是蒼蠅...
with a mouth full of flies...

435
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,168
...現在就說
...speak now. 

436
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,156
帶上我吧
Take me with you. 

437
00:29:08,157 --> 00:29:09,546
去哪兒都行...
Any point of the compass...

438
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,965
吉卜，帶你去哪呀？
Take you where，Gibbs？

439
00:29:11,966 --> 00:29:14,382
青春之泉？是嗎？
The Fountain？Aye？

440
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,512
傑克也要去那兒吧？
Is that where Jack be headed？

441
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:21,716
吉卜，你能給我什麼？
Have you anything you can offer me，Gibbs？

442
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:23,384
什麼都沒有？
Anything at all？

443
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,909
我說話算話
Upon me naked word，

444
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,655
你看不到日出了
you'll not see the dawn. 

445
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,437
拿過來
Hand it over. 

446
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,328
你這笨蛋！
You fool！

447
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,479
我正好有足夠時間
I had just enough time

448
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,108
研究這些陰間的符號
to study those infernal circles. 

449
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,568
每條路線，每個目的地
Every route，every destination. 

450
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,883
全都在…這
All safe... in here. 

451
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:58,419
吉卜先生，歡迎加入皇家海軍
Welcome back to His Majesty's navy，Master Gibbs. 

452
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,500
起床了，水手！
Show a leg，sailor！

453
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,873
是，長官
Aye，sir. 

454
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:17,711
什麼？
What？

455
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,450
這誤會大了
There's been a horrible mistake. 

456
00:30:19,452 --> 00:30:21,046
繼續走
Keep moving. 

457
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,039
我不應該在這裡
I'm not supposed to be here. 

458
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:25,523
很多人在船上醒來
Many a man's woken up at sea，

459
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,591
都搞不清楚狀況
no idea what，when，wherefore or why. 

460
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:28,874
不記得前一晚
No memory of the night afore，

461
00:30:28,876 --> 00:30:29,989
在哪簽了什麼合同
whence he signed up

462
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,652
還把錢通通拿去買醉
and drank away all his bonus money. 

463
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,787
不，老兄，你不明白
No，no，no. You don't understand，mate. 

464
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:35,115
我是傑克史派洛船長
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow. 

465
00:30:35,117 --> 00:30:36,332
獨此一家，如假包換
The original. The only. 

466
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:37,747
我是石頭，幸會了
Scrum，and the pleasure's all mine. 

467
00:30:37,749 --> 00:30:39,027
繼續走
Now，keep moving. 

468
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:49,012
石頭
Scrum. 

469
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,377
靠過來
Get your elbows in！

470
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,750
為什麼那有一個玻璃棺？
Why is there a glass coffin？

471
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,355
看來像我管的？
Do I look like a man in charge？

472
00:30:58,489 --> 00:30:59,957
我在哪裡？
Where am I？

473
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,424
抱歉，史派洛船長
'Scuse me，Captain Sparrow，sir. 

474
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,220
我很榮幸歡迎你登上
I be right honoredto welcome you aboard

475
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,994
臭名狼藉的
our world-renowned vessel of infamy，

476
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,626
安妮王后復仇號
Queen Anne's Revenge. 

477
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,695
黑鬍子的船
Blackbeard. 

478
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,917
幹活
Work！

479
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,591
他是一個奇怪的傢伙
He's a curious one. 

480
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:37,454
他是活死人
He's been zombiefied. 

481
00:31:37,456 --> 00:31:38,728
啥？

482
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,254
活死人
Zombiefied. 

483
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,144
黑鬍子幹的
Blackbeard's doing. 

484
00:31:42,146 --> 00:31:43,890
每個頭兒都是
All the officers are the same. 

485
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,764
好讓他們更順從
Makes 'em more compliant. 

486
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,006
而且脾氣一樣壞
And perpetually ill-tempered. 

487
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,005
快點，用力擦洗
Come on. Scrub. 

488
00:31:52,007 --> 00:31:53,302
是
Yeah. 

489
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:04,014
拉！拉！用力拉！
Pull！Pull！Pull！

490
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,119
航行了五天，至少
Five days underway，at least. 

491
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:15,096
對，你從海水味道聞出來的？
Aye. You can tell thatby the smell of the sea？

492
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,962
是船員的臭味
Smell of the crew. 

493
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:23,632
喂，那可憐的混帳幹了什麼？
Oi. What did that poor sod do？

494
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,800
我該怎樣才不會這樣？
And how can I make sure to not？

495
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,276
他喔？是虔誠教徒
Him？Churchly fellow. 

496
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,438
老唸著萬能的主啊
Always going on about the Lord Almighty. 

497
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,310
宗教狂熱份子在這艘船上？
Bible-thumper on this ship？

498
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,350
他以前是傳教士
A missionary is his story. 

499
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:37,249
我聽說他是在一次劫掠中被抓來
What I heard was he got captured in a raid. 

500
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:40,256
船上其他人全被殺了，除了他
Rest of the ship got killed，but not 'im. 

501
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,689
大副不肯殺死他
First mate wouldn't let it happen

502
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:44,522
因為他信主
on account of his premier standing with the Lord. 

503
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:46,865
大副以她的生命
A first mate sticking her neck 

504
00:32:46,867 --> 00:32:49,065
替囚犯求情
out for some prisoner. 

505
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:50,825
那是你不能理解的
That you don't see. 

506
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,665
「她」？大副是「女的」？
「Her」？First mate is a「her」？

507
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,033
回去幹活！
Back to work！

508
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,613
穩穩地保持航向
Steady as she goes. 

509
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,017
妳是個無情的
You are a ruthless，

510
00:33:23,019 --> 00:33:25,201
卑鄙的，超級難搞的壞蛋
soulless，cross-grained cur. 

511
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,082
我跟你說過我有一艘船
I told you I had a ship. 

512
00:33:27,084 --> 00:33:28,828
不對，是黑鬍子有一艘船
No，Blackbeard has a ship，

513
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:31,771
妳害我變成囚犯
upon which I am now imprisoned. 

514
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,911
傑克，我們辦得到的
We can do this，Jack. 

515
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:36,343
青春之泉
The Fountain of Youth，

516
00:33:36,344 --> 00:33:38,641
你不也一直想找到
like you always wanted. 

517
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,033
黑鬍子
Blackbeard. 

518
00:33:40,034 --> 00:33:41,315
愛德華汀奇
Edward Teach. 

519
00:33:41,317 --> 00:33:43,881
所有海盜都怕的海盜
The pirate all pirates fear. 

520
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,183
有空就玩玩死人復活
Resurrector of the dead in his spare time. 

521
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:47,758
他會聽我的
He will listen to me. 

522
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,191
他誰也不會聽
He listens to no one. 

523
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:52,228
也許會聽他親生女兒的？
Maybe to his own daughter？

524
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:57,701
女兒…親生女兒？
Daughter as in... beget by？

525
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,486
失散很久
Long-lost. 

526
00:34:00,487 --> 00:34:02,403
最近才相認
Recently found. 

527
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,374
全心全意愛她的老爸
Who loves her dear papa with all her soul. 

528
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:07,541
他信這套鬼話？
He bought that？

529
00:34:07,543 --> 00:34:08,570
我說服了他
I sold that. 

530
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,817
那麼找青春之泉是為了他
Then it's the Fountain of Youth for him，

531
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,456
或者是為了你們
or him and you，

532
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:20,922
不是為了我們
not you and me. 

533
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:23,051
不，傑克，最棒的是
No，Jack，that's the best part. 

534
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:25,253
他就快要死了
He will be dead. 

535
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,964
妳要親手殺了他？
You'll be handling that part yourself，then？

536
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,364
有一個預言
There is a prophecy. 

537
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,699
也許你不相信超自然現象
Maybe you don't believein the supernatural. 

538
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:34,960
喔，不
Oh，no，no. 

539
00:34:34,962 --> 00:34:36,296
這我倒是看過一兩次
I've seen a thing or two. 

540
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:42,835
這個預言是這樣的：
The prophecy is this:

541
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:46,814
黑鬍子兩周內將會死亡
Blackbeard will meet his death within a fortnight

542
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:50,409
死在一個獨腿者的手上
at the hands of a one-legged man. 

543
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,750
所以他需要青春之泉
That's why he needs the Fountain，Jack. 

544
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:11,837
吉卜先生，我們沒有地圖
Master Gibbs，short we are a map. 

545
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,523
也許你該好心
Perhaps you'd be so kindas 

546
00:35:13,523 --> 00:35:15,070
給我們一個航向
to provide us an heading. 

547
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,943
麻煩倒杯酒給我
Be a gem and pour me a gulper. 

548
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:22,803
不行，我們是私掠船
Nay. We be privateers， 

549
00:35:22,804 --> 00:35:24,521
不是海盜，吉卜先生
not pirates，Master Gibbs.

550
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,782
我們奉國王陛下之名行事
And in the king's name，we behave as such. 

551
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,757
遵命，船長
Aye，Captain. 

552
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,962
吉卜，我們是在正確的航線上嗎？
Be we on the proper course，Gibbs？

553
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,398
對，是正確的
Aye，it be proper. 

554
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,696
那就是證明
There's your proof. 

555
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:48,508
西班牙艦隊
The Spaniard. 

556
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:53,236
全員注意，戰鬥位置
All hands！Battle stations！

557
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:54,814
航向上風
Get to windward！

558
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,482
全員注意，航向上風
All hands，windward！

559
00:35:56,484 --> 00:35:58,012
加固兩點
Harden up two points！

560
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,874
兩點
Two points！

561
00:35:59,876 --> 00:36:01,592
砲手解開大砲
Cast loose the cannons！

562
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,446
槍手，各就各位
Gunners，take posts！

563
00:36:07,448 --> 00:36:09,329
就位，槍手待命，長官
Take position！Gunners ready，sir！

564
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,401
大砲解開，填彈
Out！Thrust！

565
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:13,335
等待命令
Await orders. 

566
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:16,804
穩住
Steady！

567
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:19,734
填好砲彈，等待命令，長官
Guns armed，awaiting orders，sir. 

568
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:29,077
長官，命令，長官？
Sir. Orders，sir？

569
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,423
他甚至都沒有轉動他的頭
He never so much as turned his head. 

570
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,428
青春之泉才是目標
The Fountain is the prize. 

571
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,380
看來他們不想浪費時間
It appears we be not even worth the time 

572
00:36:42,381 --> 00:36:44,194
擊沉我們
it'd take to sink us. 

573
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,286
我們已經落後了
And now we've fallen behind. 

574
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:48,237
全員注意，全速前進
All hands，make more sail！

575
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,932
全員注意，全速前進
All hands，more sail！

576
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:54,408
讓我們乘風破浪吧
Ride hard between wind and tide！

577
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,983
各位，我要說的可是叛變
The topic，gentlemen，is mutiny. 

578
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,556
最可怕的叛變
Mutiny most foul. 

579
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:13,000
是呀，我是來當傑克史派洛的船員
Aye. I signed up to sail under Jack Sparrow，

580
00:37:13,002 --> 00:37:14,222
不是冒牌船長
not some pretender. 

581
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:15,627
而且還是個女的
And a lady，at that. 

582
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,961
也沒人提到船上有活死人
And mention was failed to be made of this uncanny crew. 

583
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:20,468
我怕得腿都軟了
Make my toes curl，they do. 

584
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:22,135
我拿到了
I got 'em.

585
00:37:22,137 --> 00:37:23,665
全部
All of them. 

586
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:24,808
幹得好
Well done. 

587
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:25,775
好樣的
Good lad. 

588
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,344
我說，黑鬍子
On to it，then. Blackbeard. 

589
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:29,729
有什麼習慣？
What are his habits？

590
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:30,946
他多半都待在船長室
Stays mostly to his cabin. 

591
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,880
沒錯，都待在船長室
That's right，mostly to his cabin. 

592
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:35,600
沒錯，但是當他出來...
Yes，but when he comes out...

593
00:37:35,602 --> 00:37:37,216
他從來都不出來
He don't really come out. 

594
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,555
他總是會出來吧
He must come out sometime. 

595
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,620
並沒有
Not really，no. 

596
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,158
有人和他航海過？
Any of you sail with him before？

597
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,032
沒，沒有
No，no. 

598
00:37:48,034 --> 00:37:48,765
我從來沒有
I've never. 

599
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:49,923
絕對沒有
Definitely not. 

600
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:52,000
有人看過他？
Any of you seen him before？

601
00:37:52,002 --> 00:37:53,935
並沒有，沒有
Not really，no. 

602
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:56,620
他待在船長室
Stays to his cabin，

603
00:37:56,622 --> 00:37:57,700
沒人和他航海
no one sailed with him，

604
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,900
沒人見過他...
no one's seen him...

605
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:01,645
各位，好消息
Good news，gentlemen. 

606
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:03,212
這不是黑鬍子的船
This is not Blackbeard's ship. 

607
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,147
這不是安妮王后復仇號
This is not the Queen Anne's Revenge. 

608
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,174
不對，這是安妮王后復仇號
No，this be the Queen Anne's Revenge，right enough. 

609
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:08,785
你怎麼知道？
How do you know？

610
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,552
我看過船名
I've seen the name，

611
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,184
就在船尾
on the back of the ship. 

612
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:20,386
各位，各位夥伴...
Gentlemen，sirs，fellow conscriptees...

613
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,260
...你們都被騙了
...you have been monstrously deceived. 

614
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:27,350
我們被耍了？
We are decepted，then？

615
00:38:27,352 --> 00:38:28,532
沒錯
Yes. 

616
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:31,608
你們都不知道目的地吧
You've nay been informed of a destination. 

617
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,870
死亡就擺在我們面前了
Death lies before us

618
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:36,429
因為我們正航向
as we sail 

619
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,846
青春之泉
for the Fountain of Youth. 

620
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,346
情況不妙啊，夥計們
It would be a sorry plight，mates. 

621
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,898
我們死定了
Death，for certain. 

622
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,616
那兒是幽靈的花園
The garden of darkened souls. 

623
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,407
我們的葬生之地
Untimely our ends will be. 

624
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,091
除非...
Unless...

625
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,752
...我們搶下這艘船
...we take the ship. 

626
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:57,626
我們搶下這艘船，現在！
We take the ship，then. Now！

627
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,363
快去啊
Go on，then. 

628
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:05,455
快幫忙，水手們！
Help me，shipmates！

629
00:39:05,457 --> 00:39:06,769
給他們武器！
Give it to 'em！

630
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:08,059
起來！船是我們的！
Wake up！It's ours！

631
00:39:08,061 --> 00:39:09,174
快一點！
Come on！

632
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:10,974
起來！讓開！
Get up！Off your backside！

633
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,699
你們起來！
Get off your fannies！

634
00:39:13,701 --> 00:39:14,882
給他們武器！
Take it to them，lads！

635
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,850
快幫忙！戰鬥！
Help me！Fight！

636
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,800
傑克
Jack. 

637
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:35,752
如果這是夢
If this is a dream，

638
00:39:35,754 --> 00:39:38,067
你可以留著劍和靴子
you can keep the sword and boots on. 

639
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,474
如果不是...
If it's not...

640
00:39:41,476 --> 00:39:42,736
這當然是夢
It's a dream. 

641
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:49,410
不，才怪！
No，it's not！

642
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,522
我覺得該好心先給妳警告
I thought I should give you fair warning，

643
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:54,323
我們要搶這艘船
we're taking the ship. 

644
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:55,815
這不是個人恩怨
Nothing personal. 

645
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,794
這對妳可能比較好...
Think you might be better off if you just...

646
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:01,762
...妳只要待著別插手
...stay out of it. 

647
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:26,653
礙事

648
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,544
可惡！
Wretch！

649
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:21,167
是當夥伴還是當敵人！
You're either with us or against us！

650
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,479
我不支持你們
I am not with you，

651
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:23,645
也不反對你們！
neither am I against you！

652
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,012
他到底要怎麼樣？
Can he do that？

653
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,175
他本來就沒有什麼自己的立場
He's religious. I believe it's required. 

654
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,150
奮戰到底吧
Fight to the bitter end，

655
00:41:35,152 --> 00:41:36,824
你們這群傻蛋！
you cack-handed deck apes！

656
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:49,839
抓住他
Take him，men. 

657
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,039
把他綁牢了！
Tie him down tight！

658
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:07,518
船是我們的了！
The ship is ours！

659
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:38,583
各位
Gentlemen. 

660
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,522
我被搞糊塗了
I be placed in a bewilderment. 

661
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,965
我正在
There I were，

662
00:42:51,966 --> 00:42:54,297
休息著
resting，

663
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:55,838
然後突然間
and upon a sudden，

664
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,102
聽到甲板傳來吵鬧聲
I hear an ungodly row on deck. 

665
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:04,113
水手們擅離崗位
Sailors abandon their posts

666
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,773
沒有命令，未經許可
without orders，without leave. 

667
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:11,116
幹粗活的水手
Men before the mast，

668
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,655
想要聯手搶下這艘船
taking the ship for themselves. 

669
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:17,690
那算什麼呀，大副？
What be that，First Mate？

670
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,278
叛變，船長
Mutiny，Captain. 

671
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,694
再說一次？
Again？

672
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:22,349
叛變！
Mutiny！

673
00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:23,833
是啊
Aye. 

674
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:26,096
叛變
Mutiny. 

675
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:32,042
叛變者的下場是什麼？
And what fate befalls mutineers？

676
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:35,701
大家都知道答案了，對吧？
Now，we know the answer to that，do we not？

677
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:39,440
你們這是自尋死路！
Mutineers hang！

678
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:30,995
船長，我要報告有人叛變
Captain，I wish to report a mutiny. 

679
00:44:31,903 --> 00:44:34,289
我能扳著指頭數出來，一個個報給你聽
I can name fingers and point names. 

680
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:35,738
用不著，史派洛先生
No need，Mr.Sparrow. 

681
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,489
他們是嘍囉
They are sheep. 

682
00:44:37,491 --> 00:44:39,104
你，才是主腦
You，their shepherd. 

683
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,362
我有提過
Have I mentioned，sir，

684
00:44:45,364 --> 00:44:46,710
你女兒有多美嗎？
what a lovely daughter you have？

685
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,785
那她就是你死前最後的美景了
A fitting last sight for a doomed soul. 

686
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:51,153
別忘了，父親
Remember，Father. 

687
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:52,353
我們需要他
We need him. 

688
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:54,089
如果我不隔幾天就殺個人
If I don't kill a man every now and then，

689
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:55,089
大家就會忘了我是誰
they forget who I am. 

690
00:44:55,091 --> 00:44:56,525
懦夫！
Coward！

691
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:00,392
他們不會忘記
They do not forget. 

692
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,863
你的船員視你如惡棍
Your crew sees you for the miscreant you are. 

693
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,332
是個懦夫，不管你殺多少人
A coward，no matter how many you slay. 

694
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,870
我又被搞糊塗了
Twice in one day，I find myself in a bewilderment. 

695
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:10,132
你沒有被搞糊塗，你是害怕
You are not bewildered，you are afraid. 

696
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:11,990
你不敢走向正義
You dare not walk the path of righteousness，

697
00:45:11,991 --> 00:45:13,139
走向光明之路
the way of the light. 

698
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:17,679
不對，我沒那麼複雜
No，sir. The truth is it be much simpler than all that.

699
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:19,378
我是個壞人
I am a bad man. 

700
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,582
那，也是
That，too. 

701
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,709
我也許也得殺了你，牧師
I might have to kill you too，catechist. 

702
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:23,900
不行！
No！

703
00:45:23,902 --> 00:45:25,447
就像她拉丁媽媽
All Latin blood like her mother. 

704
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:27,682
父親，求求你
Father，I beg you. 

705
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:29,046
我又來了
There I be again，

706
00:45:29,047 --> 00:45:31,557
老忘記傳教士為什麼在這裡
forgetting why the missionary is here. 

707
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:36,098
是我女兒想救贖我僅存的靈魂
My daughter fears for my soul，or what's left of it. 

708
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:40,764
妳真的想救贖我嗎，我的孩子？
You truly wish to save me，my child？

709
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,838
每個靈魂都會被救贖
Every soul can be saved. 

710
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,772
真的嗎，年輕的牧師？
Be that true，young cleric？

711
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:46,909
是的
Yes. 

712
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:49,606
我看雖然救贖你是有一點風險
Though you I sees a bit of a long shot. 

713
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:52,594
我仍然為這地獄船上
Still，I pray for every unfortunate 

714
00:45:52,595 --> 00:45:54,573
每個不幸的靈魂祈禱
soulon this hell-bound vessel. 

715
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,783
妳用妳的信仰解除了我的武裝
You disarm me with your faith. 

716
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:02,625
現在是八點！
Eight bells！

717
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,752
是哪個不幸的靈魂守瞭望台？
Which of you unfortunate soulsstood watch？

718
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:08,376
是我，是我在守望
I did. I stood watch. 

719
00:46:08,378 --> 00:46:10,856
砲手
Gunner. 

720
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,639
是你？
You？

721
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:19,935
是
Aye. 

722
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:22,274
好吧
Aye. 

723
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:24,403
廚子
The cook. 

724
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:27,416
太好了，降下長艇！
Perfect. Lower the longboat！

725
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:34,647
掉頭！
Bring her about！

726
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:47,716
你為什麼要這樣做？
Why do you do this？

727
00:46:47,718 --> 00:46:49,229
叛變，我們的法律是清楚的
Mutiny. Our laws be clear. 

728
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:51,670
我們的法律允許船長法外施恩
Our laws allow the Captain to show leniency. 

729
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,437
我給過他機會決定他的命運
I have given this mana chance to determine his fate，

730
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,240
不是每個人都有的
a gift not afforded to all. 

731
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:06,822
喔，現在你
Oh，you now. 

732
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:10,859
有機會來顯現你的祈禱的價值了
Chance to show the worth of your prayers. 

733
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:14,922
祈禱他脫離…邪惡？
Pray he be delivered from... evil？

734
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,605
瞄準目標！
Course made！

735
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:26,606
住手，給他機會，也給你自己...
Stop. Give that man a chance. Give yourself a...

736
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:55,070
知道我在什麼時候最接近造物主？
You know when I feel closest to our Maker？

737
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,070
在我看到苦難，痛苦和悲傷的時候
When I see suffering，pain and anguish. 

738
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:59,599
這時祂才會顯現真正的意圖
That's when the true design of this world is revealed. 

739
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:03,440
我看到是祂在苦難和悲劇發生時
And I see it revealed when in times of hardship and tragedy，

740
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,878
才對需要的人施予仁慈和憐憫
kindness and compassion are shown to those in need. 

741
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:08,416
也許你該祈禱他不受傷害，是吧？
Perhaps you should pray for him to be unharmed，yes？

742
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,650
他還有機會...
Please，there's still hope...

743
00:48:09,652 --> 00:48:10,747
再開砲！
Again！

744
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,060
其實我對青春之泉毫無興趣
I actually have no interest in the Fountain whatsoever，

745
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:28,068
如果你心意已定
so，if your heart is set，

746
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:30,400
那我就任你處置
you may drop me off anywhere you like. 

747
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,303
舵手，可以了
That'll be all，Quartermaster. 

748
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:37,058
你說的話像霧一樣
Your words surround you like fog 

749
00:48:37,059 --> 00:48:38,804
讓我看不透
and make you hard to see. 

750
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:42,783
你呢，強大的黑鬍子？
And what of you，the mighty Blackbeard？

751
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,302
聽說你被砍頭
Beheaded they say. 

752
00:48:44,304 --> 00:48:47,574
但你的身體還繞著你的船游三圈
Still，your body swam three times around your ship， 

753
00:48:47,576 --> 00:48:49,292
然後爬上船去
then climbed back onboard. 

754
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,723
而現在你好好的
And here you are，

755
00:48:50,724 --> 00:48:52,020
卻怕得要命
running scared. 

756
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:54,381
怕得要命
Scared. 

757
00:48:54,383 --> 00:48:56,099
要找青春之泉
To the Fountain. 

758
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:59,259
舵手有預知能力
The Quartermaster sees things before they happen. 

759
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:01,560
他預知我的死亡
He has foreseen my death，

760
00:49:01,562 --> 00:49:03,897
所以命運開口了
and so the fates have spoken. 

761
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:06,373
我的命運已經決定
The threads of destiny woven. 

762
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:09,478
你太高估命運的力量了
You have a ridiculously high regard for fate，mate. 

763
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:10,427
那你呢？
And you？

764
00:49:10,429 --> 00:49:11,240
我？
Me？

765
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:13,498
預知命運我是懷疑的...
I'm skeptical of predicting any future... 

766
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,648
包括我自己
which includes me. 

767
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,687
反抗命運是件傻事
It'd be foolish to battle fate，

768
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:21,588
但我想冒這個險
but I'd be tempted to cheat it. 

769
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:23,143
我會找到青春之泉
I will reach the Fountain. 

770
00:49:23,145 --> 00:49:24,593
你會帶我去
You will lead me. 

771
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,027
那把刀和你搞的
That knife will serve you no better than  

772
00:49:29,028 --> 00:49:31,023
叛變一樣沒用
the mutiny you devised. 

773
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:32,965
叛變很有用
Mutiny served me well. 

774
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:35,037
不是讓我見到你了
It gained me an audience with you. 

775
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,268
是啊
Aye. 

776
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:41,473
我要警告你
To warn you. 

777
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:44,004
注意你的大副
Regarding your first mate，

778
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:47,048
她並不是她說的那個人
who pretends to be persons she is not. 

779
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,675
繼續說
Do tell. 

780
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,051
她不是你的女兒
She is not your daughter. 

781
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:59,386
你膽敢這麼說我的親生骨肉？
You dare to speak thusly of my flesh and blood？

782
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:04,057
那女人是個高明的騙徒
Sir，the woman is consummate in the art of deception. 

783
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:05,661
我很清楚
I know. 

784
00:50:05,663 --> 00:50:07,162
是我不小心
As I mostly unwittingly 

785
00:50:07,163 --> 00:50:08,661
讓她走上這條路
set her on her wicked path. 

786
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:11,320
雖然我不能說
Though I cannot claim credit for her  

787
00:50:11,321 --> 00:50:13,843
她的天賦是我教的
existing abundance of natural talent. 

788
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,337
安潔莉卡，我鍾愛的女兒
Angelica. My beloved daughter，

789
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:21,076
我這輩子做過最好的事
the one true good thing I have done in this life，

790
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:22,549
而你卻自稱你教壞了她？
and you claim to be the one who corrupted her？

791
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:28,048
她是純粹的邪惡化身
Sir，what she is pure evil. 

792
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,591
比野獸更令人害怕
More to be feared than a wild beast. 

793
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:34,561
又餓又有尖牙的野獸
Hungry wild beast with gnashing teeth. 

794
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,723
報復的，來自地獄的飢餓野獸...
Vengeful，hungry from hell beast...

795
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:37,948
父親？
Father？

796
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:39,028
但是很可愛！
Sweetness！

797
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:42,529
不必傷害他的，父親
No need to hurt him，Father. 

798
00:50:42,672 --> 00:50:45,903
他會幫助我們，對吧，傑克？
He will help us. Won't you，Jack？

799
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,909
瞧？到現在
You see？Even now，

800
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:49,774
她還是關心你的安危
she attends to your welfare，

801
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:53,474
雖然你一再說她是騙子
giving lie to the claims you make of her. 

802
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:05,552
你會帶我們到青春之泉，對吧？
You will lead us to the Fountain. Yes？

803
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:08,058
換另一個方式說吧
Put another way. 

804
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:12,266
要是我來不及趕到青春之泉...
If I do not make it to the Fountain in time...

805
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,896
...你也去不了
...neither will you. 

806
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:21,107
我馬上仔細看
I'll have a wee look-see at those 

807
00:51:21,108 --> 00:51:23,172
這些航海圖，好吧？
charts straight away then，shall I？

808
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,179
長官
Sir. 

809
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:32,237
什麼事？
Aye？

810
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:33,420
船長，長官
Captain，sir，

811
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:35,957
長官，我在船員中聽到
I am unhappy to report rumors，sir，

812
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:39,000
關於目的地不好的謠言
among the crew，as to our destination. 

813
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:41,454
閉上你的嘴給我離開
Shut your trap and make way. 

814
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:47,284
你想抗命
That's the way of it，then. 

815
00:51:47,286 --> 00:51:49,098
無意冒犯，長官
No disrespect，sir. 

816
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:51,795
他們怕什麼？說出來
What do the men fear？Say it. 

817
00:51:51,797 --> 00:51:52,739
說出那個字
Speak the words. 

818
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:54,808
白帽灣
Whitecap Bay. 

819
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,073
是啊，白帽灣
Aye，Whitecap Bay. 

820
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:00,229
所有沒用的水手
And every worthless seaman fears the name，

821
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:02,277
都恐懼這名字
and rightly so，

822
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:04,915
雖然少數人知道原因或膽敢詢問
though few know why or dare to ask. 

823
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:06,548
傳說是真的？
Be the stories true？

824
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:08,620
吉卜，說，是什麼讓你們動搖了
Say what robs you of your staunch heart，Gibbs，

825
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:11,821
否則永遠留在幻想的領域
or forever leave it to the wider fields of fancy. 

826
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:16,125
人魚，船長
Mermaids，Captain. 

827
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:18,029
是啊，人魚
Aye. Mermaids. 

828
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:20,319
大海食屍鬼，魔鬼魚
Sea ghouls，devil fish，

829
00:52:20,321 --> 00:52:22,470
令人恐懼的是超愛吃人肉
dreadful in hunger for flesh of man. 

830
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:26,033
我們就是要經過人魚海域
Mermaid waters，that be our path. 

831
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:27,768
顧好你的靈魂，吉卜
Cling to your soul，Gibbs，

832
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:31,541
聽說人魚會把人吃到...
as mermaids be given to take the rest...

833
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:33,114
...只剩骨頭
...to the bone. 

834
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,233
冷靜！冷靜，大夥們！
Steady！Steady，men！

835
00:52:36,234 --> 00:52:37,814
鼓起你們的勇氣
Find your courage，

836
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:39,854
不然就準備恐懼吧！
or be ready to purpose your fear！

837
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,390
自求多福吧！
Save yourselves！

838
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:46,395
有人落水！
Man overboard！

839
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:47,828
不是！那是棄船者
Nay！A deserter. 

840
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:48,846
改變航向
Come about. 

841
00:52:48,848 --> 00:52:49,727
不
Nay！

842
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,335
各位
Gentlemen，

843
00:52:52,337 --> 00:52:54,154
我不會要求你們
I shall not ask any more of  

844
00:52:54,156 --> 00:52:55,971
做辦不到的事
any man than what that man can deliver，

845
00:52:55,973 --> 00:52:59,465
但我想問：我們是不是英國的臣民？
but I do ask this：Are we not king's men？

846
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,043
是
Aye. 

847
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,560
那我們是不是國王的好臣民？
On the king's mission？

848
00:53:02,562 --> 00:53:03,942
是
Aye. 

849
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:06,230
當西班牙佬從旁經過時
I did not note any fear in the eyes 

850
00:53:06,232 --> 00:53:08,346
我在西班牙佬眼中看不到恐懼
of the Spanish as they passed us by. 

851
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:09,950
你們敢不敢去白帽灣？
Are we not king's men？

852
00:53:09,952 --> 00:53:11,215
敢！
Aye！

853
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:14,289
現在給我滾回自己的崗位幹活！
Aye！Hands all off，and bear away！

854
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:17,392
直直航向白帽灣！
Stave on ahead to Whitecap Bay！

855
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,395
航向，白帽灣！
Bear on，Whitecap Bay！

856
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,868
來嘛
Come. 

857
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:38,310
喝點酒？
Little drink？

858
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:41,712
美酒，音樂，燭光
Wine，music，candlelight. 

859
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:44,081
這種事我們早就做過，傑克
I think we've traveled down this road before，Jack. 

860
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,052
沒錯，我們是做過
Yes，we have. 

861
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:48,422
我記得很清楚
I remember it well. 

862
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:55,095
纏繞，扭曲和轉動，迴轉，扭動著
Winding，twisting andturning，gyrating，writhing. 

863
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,564
不停地扭動著
Incessant writhing. 

864
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:59,566
記得聖多明哥嗎？
Do you recall Saint Dominique？

865
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:02,562
拉馬提尼克島
La Martinique. 

866
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:04,401
在聖多明哥我就想殺你了
I tried to kill you in Saint Dominique. 

867
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,304
無所謂啦
Either or. 

868
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,135
對一位大副幾乎沒有恰當的
Hardly appropriate for a first mate. 

869
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:12,737
我是妳的第一次嗎？我總想知道
Was I the first？I've often wondered. 

870
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:17,114
當你有慾望時真迷人，傑克
You can be so charming when you want something，Jack. 

871
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,745
竅門是找出你想要什麼
The trick is finding out what. 

872
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:22,950
事實，是什麼？
The truth，then，is it？

873
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,151
黑鬍子已經達到他的目的
Blackbeard has served his purpose. 

874
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:28,628
妳和我一起去青春之泉
You and I can go to the Fountain together，

875
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:31,825
一起沐浴在青春之泉
where we shall bathe one another in equal shares of fame

876
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:33,993
盡情享受各種歡愉
and other assorted debaucheries. 

877
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:37,129
而我告訴你青春之泉的儀式
And I'll tell youthe ritual of the Fountain. 

878
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:40,107
對，異教的儀式
Yes. The profane ritual. 

879
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:45,007
我能信任你嗎，傑克？
Can I trust you，Jack？

880
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:47,367
我需要你站在我這邊
I need you on my side. 

881
00:54:47,369 --> 00:54:49,585
最親愛的安潔莉卡
Oh，my dearest Angelica. 

882
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:53,144
我們是神偷俠侶
You and I are asthick as thieves，love. 

883
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,520
告訴我那個儀式
Tell me the rules. 

884
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:01,324
青春之泉的泉水
Water from the Fountain of Youth. 

885
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:06,602
人魚閃亮的淚水
The shimmering tear of a mermaid. 

886
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:10,036
龐塞德萊昂的銀杯
The silver chalices of Ponce de Leon. 

887
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,704
只要用這些東西...
With these items...

888
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:14,907
怎樣？
Yes？

889
00:55:14,909 --> 00:55:15,970
用這些東西
With these items，

890
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:19,513
你就能得到另一個人的全部歲月
you may take all the years of life from another，Jack. 

891
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:23,616
傑克，你知道這意味著什麼
You know what that means. 

892
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,655
我們倆不能單獨去
We cannot go alone，you and I. 

893
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,054
儀式需要一名犧牲者
The ritual requires a victim. 

894
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:32,728
這真不幸
That is unfortunate. 

895
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,662
是啊
Yes，it is. 

896
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,532
我對青春之泉的慾望都沒了
I find my desire for the Fountaing reatly lessened. 

897
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:42,564
不過船上有你想要的東西
But there is something on board you do want. 

898
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:49,710
黑鬍子來了怎麼辦？
What about Blackbeard？

899
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,644
他在海圖室
He's in the chart room. 

900
00:55:51,646 --> 00:55:53,441
我們要快點
We'll have to be quick. 

901
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:05,119
他把每艘船當成戰利品保存著
He keeps each ship as a prize. 

902
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:09,126
只要你幫我
You help me，

903
00:56:09,128 --> 00:56:11,356
我保證讓你挑你要的船
and I promise you your pick. 

904
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:14,902
雖然我知道你會挑哪一艘
Though I think I know the one you will choose. 

905
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:23,268
鬼盜船在瓶子裡？
The Black Pearl in a bottle？

906
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:25,142
鬼盜船怎麼會在瓶子裡？
Why is the Black Pearl in a bottle？

907
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,787
那隻猴子縮小了還是那麼討厭
He's even more annoying in miniature. 

908
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:35,937
我們就這麼說定了咯，傑克？
Do we have a deal，Jack？

909
00:56:35,939 --> 00:56:37,950
安潔莉卡，我瞭解妳
Angelica，I know you. 

910
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:40,961
妳不會偷走無辜者的生命
You are not going to steal the life of some innocent man. 

911
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:43,829
獨腿者的怎麼樣？
What about the one-legged man？

912
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,730
傑克，我需要歲月
I need years，Jack. 

913
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:51,257
不是為我
Not for me. 

914
00:56:51,259 --> 00:56:52,975
是為了我的父親
For my father. 

915
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,910
我真的是黑鬍子的女兒
I am truly the daughter of Blackbeard. 

916
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:01,110
妳迷失在自己的假話了
You've fallen for your own con，love. 

917
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,515
不是的，他是我的父親
No，he is my father. 

918
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:05,381
我對你說的假話不全是假的
The lies I told you were not lies. 

919
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:10,058
妳對我說的假話都是真的？
You lied to me by telling me the truth？

920
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,173
對
Yes. 

921
00:57:11,175 --> 00:57:12,185
這招厲害
That's very good. 

922
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:13,579
我能用這招嗎？
May I use that？

923
00:57:13,581 --> 00:57:14,796
少來，我肯定你會的
I'm sure you will，anyway. 

924
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,297
我當然會囉
Of course I will. 

925
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,130
所以，妳不會放棄這個搜尋？
So，will you not give up this quest？

926
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:22,301
我想要父愛，傑克
I want a father，Jack. 

927
00:57:22,303 --> 00:57:23,865
我不曾有過
I haven't had one. 

928
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:28,407
安潔莉卡，妳的父親，黑鬍子...
Angelica，your father，Blackbeard...

929
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,311
...他很邪惡
...he is evil，

930
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,643
而且有機會他會殺了妳
and he will kill you given the chance. 

931
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,330
他是無法被救贖的
He cannot be saved. 

932
00:57:35,332 --> 00:57:39,214
你又憑什麼來規定救贖界限？
And who are you to set the limits on redemption？

933
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:41,839
你偷走了我的青春
You stole years of my life，Jack. 

934
00:57:41,841 --> 00:57:42,688
這是你欠我的
You owe me. 

935
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:45,886
妳這是在自己找死
And you are en route to getting yourself killed，

936
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:48,360
我不想袖手旁觀
and I am not inclined to stand by and watch. 

937
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:52,229
白帽灣到了！
Whitecap Bay！

938
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,086
全員集合！
All hands on deck！

939
00:57:59,088 --> 00:58:00,832
準備上長艇！
Set to the longboats！

940
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:05,838
把漁網擺平！
Lay 'em out flat！

941
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:07,617
不要打結
No tangles. 

942
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:11,317
弄漂亮點迎接我們美麗的嬌客
Make 'em look pretty for our dainty guests. 

943
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:13,354
我們需要燈光
We're gonna need light. 

944
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:15,254
很強的燈光
A lot of light. 

945
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:18,050
跟我來！
Come！

946
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,460
聞到了嗎？鯨魚油，
Smell that？Whale oil. 

947
00:58:42,462 --> 00:58:45,082
燃燒的火光像是上帝的奇蹟
Stuff burns like a miracle from God. 

948
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:47,087
你能點燃燈塔嗎？
Can you make it work？

949
00:58:47,089 --> 00:58:48,952
英國佬製造的
Made by the English. 

950
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:50,217
我們就不要期望太大了
Let's not get our hopes up. 

951
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:03,337
月亮新的週期
The old moon in the arms of the new one. 

952
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:05,473
夏季第一次開始時
First of the summer. 

953
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:08,706
最適合蒐集人魚的淚水
Perfect for hunting a mermaid's tear. 

954
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:22,925
我們完蛋了
We're doomed. 

955
00:59:22,927 --> 00:59:24,893
她們會被人工燈光吸引
They be drawn to man-made light. 

956
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:26,376
鯊魚？
Sharks？

957
00:59:26,378 --> 00:59:27,724
比鯊魚更可怕，小子
Worse than sharks，boy. 

958
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:30,389
一小時後人魚就會來襲
There'll be mermaids upon us within the hour，

959
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:32,262
你們記住我的話
you mark my words. 

960
00:59:32,264 --> 00:59:33,991
我們就是誘餌
And we're the bait. 

961
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:40,473
我聽說從人魚那得到親吻
I heard it said a kiss from a mermaid 

962
00:59:40,474 --> 00:59:42,304
就可以保證水手不會淹死
protects a sailor from drowning. 

963
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:44,379
別傻了！
Don't be a fool！

964
00:59:44,381 --> 00:59:46,313
孩子，人魚都是女的
Mermaids are all female，son，

965
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:49,247
而且個個美如天仙
and lovely as a dream of heaven. 

966
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:53,651
到了攪拌奶油的時間
But when it comes time to churn butter，so to speak，

967
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,781
她們就從長艇
they snatch a sailor out of a boat

968
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,951
或甲板上抓走一個水手
or off the deck of a ship，have their way，

969
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:01,564
然後這些水手被拉到海底
and then the sailors are pulled to bottom 

970
01:00:01,565 --> 01:00:04,032
被淹死然後被吃掉
and drowned and eaten. 

971
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:07,925
要不然，有時，是另一種結局
Or，sometimes，the other way around. 

972
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,552
唱歌
Sing. 

973
01:00:10,554 --> 01:00:11,832
什麼？
What？

974
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:15,336
她們喜歡聽人唱歌
They like to hear singing. 

975
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:23,277
<i>我的名字是瑪麗亞</i>
<i>My name is Maria</i>

976
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:26,582
<i>一個商人的女兒</i>
<i>A merchant's daughter fair</i>

977
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:28,504
大聲點
Louder. 

978
01:00:28,506 --> 01:00:30,318
<i>我離開我的雙親</i>
<i>And I have left my parents</i>

979
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,657
<i>放棄3千英鎊年薪</i>
<i>And 3,000 pounds a year</i>

980
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,822
<i>我的心被愛神一箭射中</i>
<i>My heart is pierced by Cupid</i>

981
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:40,402
<i>黃金在我眼中變成糞土</i>
<i>I disdain all glittering gold</i>

982
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:44,028
<i>從此沒有什麼能安慰我</i>
<i>There is nothing can console me</i>

983
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:47,074
<i>除了那個快樂勇敢的水手</i>
<i>But my jolly sailor bold</i>

984
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,804
<i>我的心被愛神一箭射中</i>
<i>My heart is pierced by Cupid</i>

985
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:56,646
<i>黃金在我眼中變成糞土</i>
<i>I disdain all glittering gold</i>

986
01:00:56,786 --> 01:00:59,516
<i>從此沒有什麼能安慰我</i>
<i>There is nothing can console me</i>

987
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:04,150
<i>除了那個快樂勇敢的水手</i>
<i>But my jolly sailor bold</i>

988
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:23,569
主救救我
Lord save me. 

989
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:30,308
你們看，看那
Man，look. Look there. 

990
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:32,246
不要這樣，你會嚇走她！
You'll scare her off！

991
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:33,912
好啊，能嚇走最好！
Aye，and good riddance！

992
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:40,590
妳會說話嗎？
Can you talk？

993
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,795
會
Yes. 

994
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:53,809
妳很美麗
You're beautiful. 

995
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:56,527
那個唱歌的人是你？
Are you the one who sings？

996
01:01:56,529 --> 01:01:58,410
對
Aye. 

997
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:03,751
你是我那個快樂的水手？
Are you my jolly sailor bold？

998
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:07,169
是的，我是
Aye，that I be. 

999
01:02:07,171 --> 01:02:08,215
石頭，控制你自己！
Scrum，comport yourself！

1000
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,693
我短短悲慘的生活
Boys！There ain't much been given to me

1001
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:14,229
沒人給我什麼
in my brief，miserable life，there's the truth in it. 

1002
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,098
但我現在可以驕傲地說
But，by God，I'll have it said

1003
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:19,500
一個美人魚給了我一個吻！
that Scrum had himself a kissfrom a proper mermaid！

1004
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:24,402
<i>我的心被愛神一箭射中</i>
<i>My heart is pierced by Cupid</i>

1005
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:28,067
<i>黃金在我眼中變成糞土</i>
<i>I disdain all glittering gold</i>

1006
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:31,612
<i>從此沒有什麼能安慰我</i>
<i>There is nothing can console me</i>

1007
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:35,844
<i>除了那個快樂勇敢的水手</i>
<i>But my jolly sailor bold</i>

1008
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:40,845
<i>來吧美麗的姑娘們</i>
<i>Come all ye pretty fair maids</i>

1009
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:45,252
<i>無論妳是誰</i>
<i>Whoever you may be</i>

1010
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:48,955
<i>深愛著快樂勇敢的水手</i>
<i>Who love a jolly sailor bold</i>

1011
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:53,831
<i>在怒海中乘風破浪而行</i>
<i>That ploughs the raging sea</i>

1012
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:58,100
<i>我的心被愛神一箭射中</i>
<i>My heart is pierced by Cupid</i>

1013
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:02,439
<i>黃金在我眼中變成糞土</i>
<i>I disdain all glittering gold</i>

1014
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:06,776
<i>從此沒有什麼能安慰我</i>
<i>There is nothing can console me</i>

1015
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:11,285
<i>除了那個快樂勇敢的水手</i>
<i>But my jolly sailor bold</i>

1016
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:16,551
<i>我的心被愛神一箭射中</i>
<i>My heart is pierced by Cupid</i>

1017
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:19,957
<i>黃金在我眼中變成糞土</i>
<i>I disdain all glittering gold</i>

1018
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:24,157
<i>從此沒有什麼能安慰我</i>
<i>There is nothing can console me</i>

1019
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:28,134
<i>除了那個快樂勇敢的水手</i>
<i>But my jolly sailor bold</i>

1020
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,266
她們現身了！人魚開始了！
Out upon it！It has begun！

1021
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,051
照著她們！
Light 'em up！

1022
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:53,469
鼓起你們的勇氣！
Muster your courage！

1023
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:55,749
把她們逼到岸邊！
Drive 'em to shore！

1024
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:09,638
趕快撒網！快點！
Nets into the water！Quickly！

1025
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:02,522
撤退，所有人，上岸！保住你們的命！
Retreat，all，to land！For your lives！

1026
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:07,294
我說，撤退！
Retreat，I say！

1027
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:09,455
懦夫！回到海堙I
Cowards！Back in the water！

1028
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:13,796
上岸也無法活命！我保證！
There be no refuge on land！On my word！

1029
01:06:46,033 --> 01:06:47,202
快呀！
Come on！

1030
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:25,176
逮到一隻了！
We got one！

1031
01:08:29,455 --> 01:08:30,820
我墜入愛河了！
I'm in love！

1032
01:08:33,559 --> 01:08:34,992
檢查傷者！
Check the wounded！

1033
01:08:35,127 --> 01:08:37,925
看看能不能找到一隻活著的人魚！
See if you can find one mermaid still alive！

1034
01:09:17,202 --> 01:09:18,362
快點，快幫忙！
Come，give a hand！

1035
01:09:19,605 --> 01:09:21,630
幹得好，水手
Well done，sailor. 

1036
01:09:22,608 --> 01:09:24,235
大家都見著了沒？
Did everyone see that？

1037
01:09:24,409 --> 01:09:26,434
別讓我再來一次了哈
Because I will not be doing it again. 

1038
01:09:26,545 --> 01:09:27,890
回船上去
Back to the ship. 

1039
01:09:27,891 --> 01:09:29,568
我們去安全港灣
We head for a protected cove. 

1040
01:09:29,569 --> 01:09:31,244
現在就去
Now. 

1041
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,568
天啊，那是什麼？
Lord. Is that？

1042
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:51,035
人魚
Mermaid. 

1043
01:09:51,170 --> 01:09:52,934
馬上放棄這瘋狂任務吧
Give up this madness now. 

1044
01:09:52,936 --> 01:09:54,697
辦不到
I cannot. 

1045
01:09:55,574 --> 01:09:57,375
我們不但要踏著兩條腳印去
Ever walk on the beach，

1046
01:09:57,377 --> 01:09:59,176
還要踏著兩條腳印回來
look back and see your footsteps in the sand？

1047
01:09:59,178 --> 01:10:03,171
就像這樣，只不過腳印在我的面前
It's like that，except the footsteps lie before me. 

1048
01:10:03,315 --> 01:10:05,232
你去的時候都不是兩條腳印
Footstep，actually. 

1049
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:07,149
長官，這堿O白帽灣
Whitecap Bay，sir. 

1050
01:10:07,252 --> 01:10:08,879
我們得快點走
We must hasten. 

1051
01:10:17,029 --> 01:10:18,793
我們要用走的
We travel by foot. 

1052
01:10:18,795 --> 01:10:20,556
吉卜，給我一個方向
Gibbs，I require a heading. 

1053
01:10:20,699 --> 01:10:22,281
長官，但是，那些水手
But，sir，the men. 

1054
01:10:22,283 --> 01:10:23,862
他們早就死了
They be dead already. 

1055
01:10:24,002 --> 01:10:25,549
他們聽起來還沒死
They don't sound dead. 

1056
01:10:25,551 --> 01:10:27,096
喔，是嗎？
Oh，is that so？

1057
01:10:27,239 --> 01:10:31,573
我只聽到海鷗歸巢的聲音
Well，I hear nothing but seagulls nesting. 

1058
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:33,769
葛先生，你又聽到什麼了？
What is it that you hear，Mr. Groves？

1059
01:10:36,548 --> 01:10:40,245
海鷗…歸巢
Seagulls... nesting. 

1060
01:10:40,385 --> 01:10:41,915
沒別的聲音了
Nothing more. 

1061
01:10:41,917 --> 01:10:43,445
吉卜，方向？
Heading，Gibbs？

1062
01:10:52,097 --> 01:10:53,655
我的天
My God. 

1063
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:55,857
你的腦袋或是我的方向
Your head or my heading. 

1064
01:10:55,968 --> 01:10:57,083
快選擇
I'll have me one or t'other，

1065
01:10:57,085 --> 01:10:58,198
我才不管你死活
I don't care which. 

1066
01:11:03,375 --> 01:11:05,639
全體船員，前進！
All hands，forward！

1067
01:11:21,093 --> 01:11:23,340
史派洛，該你上場了
It's to you now，Sparrow. 

1068
01:11:23,342 --> 01:11:25,587
真的有必要嗎？
Was that really necessary？

1069
01:11:25,731 --> 01:11:28,359
你最好不知道我的船在哪
Best you not know the exact wherea bouts of my ship. 

1070
01:11:28,533 --> 01:11:30,883
我這人很小心
I be a cautious man. 

1071
01:11:30,885 --> 01:11:33,232
我也一樣
So be I. 

1072
01:11:33,338 --> 01:11:35,101
我最想要的是...
What I want first...

1073
01:11:38,644 --> 01:11:40,703
...是龐塞德萊昂的船
...is Ponce de Leon's ship. 

1074
01:12:17,816 --> 01:12:19,647
幹嘛帶著她？
Why is it we've got to bring her along？

1075
01:12:19,685 --> 01:12:21,401
淚水會乾掉
Because tears don't keep. 

1076
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:23,016
我們需要新鮮的人魚淚水
We need them fresh. 

1077
01:12:23,155 --> 01:12:25,885
到底是什麼鬼儀式？
What is the ritual again？

1078
01:12:26,024 --> 01:12:28,492
需要青春之泉泉水和人魚淚水？
Water from the Fountain and a mermaid's tear？

1079
01:12:28,627 --> 01:12:30,151
還有兩隻銀杯
And two silver chalices. 

1080
01:12:30,295 --> 01:12:32,957
一杯有一滴淚水，另一杯沒有
One cup with a tear，one without. 

1081
01:12:34,199 --> 01:12:36,633
一杯有一滴淚水而兩杯都有泉水？
So，one with a tear and water in both？

1082
01:12:36,735 --> 01:12:38,293
很複雜的，不是嗎？
Quite complicated，is it not？

1083
01:12:38,403 --> 01:12:39,950
兩杯都有泉水
Both get water. 

1084
01:12:39,951 --> 01:12:41,497
一杯有一滴淚水
One gets a tear. 

1085
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:44,302
喝下摻了淚水的那個人
The person who drinks the water with the tear

1086
01:12:44,409 --> 01:12:46,900
將得到另一個人的一生歲月
gets all the years of life from the other. 

1087
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,173
到底是多少歲月？
How many years？

1088
01:12:51,616 --> 01:12:54,585
他過去的歲月
All the years that they have lived，

1089
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,484
以及以後的歲月
and they could have lived，

1090
01:12:56,486 --> 01:12:58,247
如果命運對他夠好的話
if fate had been kinder. 

1091
01:13:07,566 --> 01:13:08,863
牧師
Clergyman. 

1092
01:13:10,836 --> 01:13:13,771
如果我有什麼不測
On the off chance that this does not go well for me，

1093
01:13:13,905 --> 01:13:15,463
我願意接受
I would like it noted here and now

1094
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:18,871
任何宗教信仰
that I am fully prepared to believe in whatever I must，

1095
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:20,773
只要死了以後可以去那個
so that I may be welcomed into that place

1096
01:13:20,912 --> 01:13:23,346
好人都能去的地方？
where all the goody-goodies get to go. Savvy？

1097
01:13:23,448 --> 01:13:25,280
傑克，有一個方法
We have a word for that，Jack. 

1098
01:13:25,282 --> 01:13:27,111
你可以改變信仰
You can convert. 

1099
01:13:27,252 --> 01:13:29,743
不過我是在有需要的時候
I was thinking more of an as-needed basis. 

1100
01:13:33,725 --> 01:13:35,022
舵手！
Quartermaster！

1101
01:13:35,594 --> 01:13:36,476
什麼事？
Aye？

1102
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:37,357
她不能呼吸了！
She cannot breathe！

1103
01:13:37,462 --> 01:13:39,009
她有水
She has water. 

1104
01:13:39,011 --> 01:13:40,556
她需要空氣！
She needs air！

1105
01:13:44,469 --> 01:13:45,453
把這個打開來
Open this. 

1106
01:13:45,455 --> 01:13:46,437
她會逃走
She will escape. 

1107
01:13:46,571 --> 01:13:48,437
你會害死她
You're killing her. 

1108
01:13:48,439 --> 01:13:50,302
我支持傳教士
I support the missionary's position. 

1109
01:13:58,817 --> 01:13:59,909
瞧？
See？

1110
01:14:04,956 --> 01:14:06,651
繼續前進
Onward. 

1111
01:14:30,849 --> 01:14:32,578
我就知道
Just as I thought. 

1112
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:34,307
不是這個方向！
Not this way！

1113
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:37,821
就是這個方向，沒錯？
This is the way，isn't it？

1114
01:14:37,956 --> 01:14:40,789
當然是，但我們應該從東邊繞過去
'Course it is，but we should go around to the east. 

1115
01:14:40,926 --> 01:14:42,791
那會偏離聖盃之路
That would take us out of the path of the chalices. 

1116
01:14:42,928 --> 01:14:43,810
我們會繞回去
Well，then we'll circle back.

1117
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:44,691
沒時間了
There is no time. 

1118
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:46,491
是妳非要帶上這條該死的人魚
You're the one who insisted on bringing the bloody mermaid. 

1119
01:14:46,631 --> 01:14:47,627
你搞叛變也浪費不少時間 
Well，the mutiny didn't help. 

1120
01:14:47,629 --> 01:14:48,622
妳走路很娘
You walk like a girl. 

1121
01:14:48,767 --> 01:14:49,814
你走路才娘
You would know. 

1122
01:14:49,816 --> 01:14:50,860
總要有人自願
Someone must go. 

1123
01:14:51,937 --> 01:14:53,461
你是說兵分兩路？
You mean split up？

1124
01:14:53,605 --> 01:14:56,506
你是說跳崖？我等不及要看
You mean jump？This I cannot wait to see. 

1125
01:14:56,641 --> 01:14:58,634
史派洛自願跳崖
Sparrow will go. 

1126
01:14:58,636 --> 01:15:00,634
找到船，取回聖盃
Find the ship，retrieve the chalices. 

1127
01:15:00,812 --> 01:15:02,780
史派洛？你怎麼知道他會回來？
Sparrow？What makes you think he will come back？

1128
01:15:02,881 --> 01:15:06,146
對啊，你怎麼知道他會回來？
Yes，what makes you think he will come back？

1129
01:15:06,284 --> 01:15:08,775
父親，不能相信他，我去
We cannot trust him，Father. I'll go. 

1130
01:15:09,621 --> 01:15:11,350
她自願去
She'll go. 

1131
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,725
青春之泉還有多遠？
How much farther to the Fountain？

1132
01:15:16,862 --> 01:15:18,557
我快沒有時間了
I'm running out of time. 

1133
01:15:20,532 --> 01:15:22,693
沿著這條河，向北走一天
About a day's march north，following that river，

1134
01:15:22,834 --> 01:15:24,580
會到達一連串的池塘
you'll get to a series of pools. 

1135
01:15:24,581 --> 01:15:26,326
就很接近了
Then you're close. 

1136
01:15:28,807 --> 01:15:30,069
你要跳下去
You will go. 

1137
01:15:32,978 --> 01:15:35,276
我就知道會這樣
I was sure it would come to this. 

1138
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:50,942
都說人從上面
You know that feeling you get sometimes 

1139
01:15:50,943 --> 01:15:53,024
往下看的時候？
when you're standing in a high place？

1140
01:15:53,164 --> 01:15:55,098
會有跳下去的衝動？
Sudden urge to jump？

1141
01:15:57,002 --> 01:15:58,560
但我沒有
I don't have it. 

1142
01:15:59,938 --> 01:16:01,496
我需要那兩隻聖盃
I need those chalices. 

1143
01:16:01,606 --> 01:16:02,852
斃了我吧
Shoot. 

1144
01:16:02,853 --> 01:16:04,097
我不想摔死
Save me the bother of the fall. 

1145
01:16:04,242 --> 01:16:07,302
你要跳下去，然後回來...
You will go. You will return...

1146
01:16:08,613 --> 01:16:10,604
...不然我就殺了她
...or I will kill her. 

1147
01:16:13,418 --> 01:16:14,942
你不會殺死自己的女兒
You won't kill your own daughter. 

1148
01:16:15,086 --> 01:16:17,884
舵手，給我六把手槍
Quartermaster，get me six more pistols，

1149
01:16:18,023 --> 01:16:19,615
兩把裝上子彈
remove the shot from all but two，

1150
01:16:19,758 --> 01:16:22,249
但別告訴我是那兩把
but do not tell me which two. 

1151
01:16:24,529 --> 01:16:27,123
史派洛先生，你來選
You get to choose，Mr. Sparrow. 

1152
01:16:29,901 --> 01:16:31,095
不
No. 

1153
01:16:33,305 --> 01:16:34,329
不
No. 

1154
01:16:37,442 --> 01:16:38,859
就這把
Yes. 

1155
01:16:38,861 --> 01:16:40,275
你確定？
You're sure？

1156
01:16:40,412 --> 01:16:41,879
當然了
'Course I am. 

1157
01:16:50,088 --> 01:16:51,146
再挑一把
Again. 

1158
01:16:52,657 --> 01:16:55,217
拜託，根本沒裝子彈
Please，they're not even loaded. 

1159
01:17:00,131 --> 01:17:01,428
再挑一把
Again. 

1160
01:17:02,267 --> 01:17:04,167
你這麼想殺她
If you're so keen on killing her，

1161
01:17:04,302 --> 01:17:05,502
為什麼不讓她跳？
why don't you just let her jump？

1162
01:17:05,504 --> 01:17:06,702
什麼？
What？

1163
01:17:07,472 --> 01:17:09,963
如果你摔死
If you jump and die，

1164
01:17:10,108 --> 01:17:13,771
那就輪到她
then she will have her chance. 

1165
01:17:13,912 --> 01:17:15,379
再挑一把
Again. 

1166
01:17:18,617 --> 01:17:20,517
喂...
Oi...

1167
01:17:20,652 --> 01:17:22,586
...從上面跳下去
...if I jump，

1168
01:17:22,587 --> 01:17:24,520
我能活命嗎？
will I survive？

1169
01:17:26,825 --> 01:17:28,190
娃娃
The doll. 

1170
01:17:44,509 --> 01:17:46,893
現在你能活命了
Yes，now you will survive. 

1171
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:49,276
胡說八道！我來跳
This is nonsense！I'm going！

1172
01:18:07,999 --> 01:18:11,230
濕了，我又濕了！
Wet. Wet again. 

1173
01:18:13,538 --> 01:18:14,989
我們繼續
We go on. 

1174
01:18:14,991 --> 01:18:16,439
往北走向青春之泉
Due north to the Fountain. 

1175
01:18:17,275 --> 01:18:18,640
父親，幹得好
Well played，Father. 

1176
01:18:20,378 --> 01:18:22,710
你早知道哪把槍有子彈，對吧？
You knew which guns were loaded，right？

1177
01:18:25,417 --> 01:18:27,408
乖女兒，當然了
Of course，my love. 

1178
01:18:37,062 --> 01:18:39,792
要是有地圖就好了
Be nice to have a map about now. 

1179
01:18:39,964 --> 01:18:41,591
或是一艘船
Or a ship. 

1180
01:18:42,333 --> 01:18:46,064
站住！千萬別動
Stop！Hold very still. 

1181
01:18:47,505 --> 01:18:51,032
別讓牠碰到你的皮膚
Ye dare not let it touch your skin. 

1182
01:18:59,751 --> 01:19:03,016
怎麼？有個嗜好有什麼不對？
What？What be wrong with an older man having a hobby？

1183
01:19:03,121 --> 01:19:05,681
你停下來幹嘛，嗯？快走！
What are you stopping for，eh？Push on！

1184
01:19:05,790 --> 01:19:06,905
快走！
Push on！

1185
01:19:06,907 --> 01:19:08,124
等你們死了有的是時間睡
You can sleep when you're dead. 

1186
01:19:08,126 --> 01:19:09,354
快走！
Push on！

1187
01:19:10,929 --> 01:19:14,296
青春之泉眷顧我們
Fortune continues to favor us. 

1188
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:44,290
聖地牙哥號
The Santiago. 

1189
01:19:44,429 --> 01:19:47,159
著名的龐塞德萊昂指揮艦
Famously captained by Ponce de Leon. 

1190
01:19:49,934 --> 01:19:51,401
那裡沒有人
There's no one there. 

1191
01:19:51,503 --> 01:19:52,527
對的
Right，then. 

1192
01:20:27,205 --> 01:20:28,638
我們不能停下來
We must not stop. 

1193
01:20:36,648 --> 01:20:38,445
妳得走路
You will walk. 

1194
01:20:57,569 --> 01:20:59,730
我不會走路
I cannot. 

1195
01:20:59,871 --> 01:21:01,668
不走就死
Walk or die. 

1196
01:21:08,112 --> 01:21:09,340
我來扶妳
Put your arms around me. 

1197
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:11,181
我沒要求幫助
I do not ask for help. 

1198
01:21:11,183 --> 01:21:12,881
但妳需要幫助
But you need it. 

1199
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:31,951
我們在趕時間，對吧？
We're in a hurry，yes？

1200
01:21:31,953 --> 01:21:34,101
不要落後了
Do not fall behind. 

1201
01:21:53,424 --> 01:21:55,187
在這暫停一下！
Hold here 'til I say！

1202
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:10,104
妳真美麗
Such beauty. 

1203
01:22:10,241 --> 01:22:13,574
妳一定是上帝親手製作的
Surely you're one of God's own creations，

1204
01:22:13,711 --> 01:22:16,646
並不是沒上方舟的
and not a descendant of those dark creatures

1205
01:22:16,781 --> 01:22:19,079
那些落難者的後代
who found no refuge on the Ark. 

1206
01:22:21,853 --> 01:22:23,980
妳真美麗...
Such beauty...

1207
01:22:25,256 --> 01:22:26,883
...但是致命
...and yet deadly. 

1208
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:29,588
致命？不是的
Deadly？No. 

1209
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:31,317
妳攻擊我
You attacked me. 

1210
01:22:31,462 --> 01:22:34,442
不是這樣的
No. 

1211
01:22:34,443 --> 01:22:36,422
你和他們不一樣
You are different. 

1212
01:22:37,335 --> 01:22:38,563
不一樣？
Different？

1213
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:40,684
不是嗎？
Are you not？

1214
01:22:40,685 --> 01:22:42,697
你保護了我
You protect. 

1215
01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:47,168
是妳做的？
Did you？

1216
01:22:48,813 --> 01:22:51,611
是妳把我從爆炸中救出來
You pushed me down out of the way. 

1217
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:54,997
你看到青春之泉嗎？
You see the Fountain？

1218
01:22:54,999 --> 01:22:57,244
沒有，但是我們很接近了
No，but we are close. 

1219
01:22:57,789 --> 01:22:58,722
把那怪物帶來
Bring the creature. 

1220
01:22:58,723 --> 01:22:59,654
罩住牠的頭
Cover its head. 

1221
01:22:59,791 --> 01:23:01,782
她有名字！
She has a name！

1222
01:23:06,297 --> 01:23:07,821
請賜教
Pray tell. 

1223
01:23:14,038 --> 01:23:15,938
她是莎琳娜
She is Syrena. 

1224
01:23:56,881 --> 01:23:58,405
龐塞德萊昂
Ponce de Leon. 

1225
01:24:02,086 --> 01:24:05,783
40個海盜做上40個晚上發財夢
If 40 pirates dreamt 40 nights of treasure，

1226
01:24:05,957 --> 01:24:09,518
也夢不到這麼多的金銀財寶
it would not match the contents of this room. 

1227
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:11,218
你
You. 

1228
01:24:13,998 --> 01:24:14,897
你
You. 

1229
01:24:14,899 --> 01:24:15,795
不...
No...

1230
01:24:16,968 --> 01:24:18,100
...你
...you. 

1231
01:24:18,102 --> 01:24:19,232
我先來的
I was here first. 

1232
01:24:19,370 --> 01:24:21,384
你，為什麼會在這裡？
You，why are you here？

1233
01:24:21,386 --> 01:24:23,397
黑鬍子派我來的
Blackbeard sent me. 

1234
01:24:23,541 --> 01:24:24,787
你又是為什麼咧？
Why are you？

1235
01:24:24,789 --> 01:24:26,032
銀杯
Silver chalices

1236
01:24:26,177 --> 01:24:27,861
替我的國王取回
for my royal liege. 

1237
01:24:27,863 --> 01:24:29,544
噢，拜託
Oh，please. 

1238
01:24:30,782 --> 01:24:32,579
退後，退後！我們得保持平衡！
Back，back！We have to balance it out！

1239
01:24:34,552 --> 01:24:37,146
整艘船會滑下去！
The whole ship will slide！

1240
01:24:40,925 --> 01:24:42,552
對喔
Right，then. 

1241
01:24:42,693 --> 01:24:45,663
如果我們各挑一個
What if we each choose an item 

1242
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:48,632
差不多重的東西？
of approximately equal weight？

1243
01:24:51,269 --> 01:24:52,736
放回去！
Put it back！

1244
01:24:54,238 --> 01:24:56,297
我們什麼都別碰！
We touch nothing！

1245
01:25:04,215 --> 01:25:05,182
那個呢？
What about that？

1246
01:25:05,349 --> 01:25:07,715
聖盃
The chalices. 

1247
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:10,944
喂！你憑什麼可以先看？
Oi！Why do you get to look first？

1248
01:25:11,089 --> 01:25:12,784
好吧
Fine，then. 

1249
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:32,822
我們一起看
Together. 

1250
01:25:32,824 --> 01:25:33,601
我們一起看
Together. 

1251
01:25:36,314 --> 01:25:37,338
是石頭
Rocks. 

1252
01:25:38,416 --> 01:25:39,781
西班牙佬
The Spanish. 

1253
01:25:40,485 --> 01:25:42,180
他們趕在我們前面
They're ahead of us，mate. 

1254
01:25:43,087 --> 01:25:44,720
我要看看那張地圖
I shall have a look at that map. 

1255
01:25:44,722 --> 01:25:46,352
一定有鬼...
If it's what I fear...

1256
01:25:56,434 --> 01:25:58,664
不然他們幹嘛把地圖留下來
I wonder why they left this behind. 

1257
01:26:01,639 --> 01:26:05,439
別動那張地圖
Don't touch the map. 

1258
01:26:10,781 --> 01:26:11,873
他們知道路線
They know the path，

1259
01:26:12,016 --> 01:26:13,967
但我知道
but I can also see where 

1260
01:26:13,968 --> 01:26:15,918
他們會在哪兒紮營
they'll most likely make camp. 

1261
01:26:29,367 --> 01:26:30,698
傑克！
Jack！

1262
01:26:33,871 --> 01:26:38,035
吉卜，我正準備策劃去監獄救你
Gibbs，I was just on me way to break you out of jail. 

1263
01:26:39,977 --> 01:26:41,501
你偷走了我的地圖
You stole my map. 

1264
01:26:42,046 --> 01:26:44,514
夠了，該走了
Right. Best be started. 

1265
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:49,076
遵命？
Ol？

1266
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:07,960
人魚
Mermaids. 

1267
01:27:10,808 --> 01:27:13,743
注意，這些池塘很深
Careful，these pools run deep. 

1268
01:27:13,878 --> 01:27:16,251
要是她逃走，一切就完了
If she escapes，all is lost. 

1269
01:27:16,252 --> 01:27:17,439
舵手
Quartermaster. 

1270
01:27:19,083 --> 01:27:22,382
看，快看！
Look. Look！

1271
01:27:23,955 --> 01:27:25,440
她被釘住
Staked out to die，

1272
01:27:25,441 --> 01:27:26,924
被太陽曬死
to dry in the sun. 

1273
01:27:27,058 --> 01:27:28,856
身體只有一半在水裡
Only half in the water. 

1274
01:27:28,858 --> 01:27:30,653
雖然活不了
Not enough to live，

1275
01:27:30,828 --> 01:27:34,992
但是卻能讓她慢慢折磨而死
but just enough to make the dying slow. 

1276
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:37,224
想想看
Think on it. 

1277
01:27:37,368 --> 01:27:39,069
妳的族人，被殺死
Your people，murdered，

1278
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:40,769
她們的淚水被收集
harvested for their tears. 

1279
01:27:40,905 --> 01:27:45,239
莎琳娜，妳怎麼不哭？
Syrena，won't you cry？

1280
01:27:46,110 --> 01:27:47,941
你們全都快死了，你也是
All die，even you. 

1281
01:27:48,079 --> 01:27:49,808
我聽得見，很快
Soon，I hear. 

1282
01:27:49,810 --> 01:27:51,537
聽好...
Listen...

1283
01:27:53,584 --> 01:27:55,449
聽好
Listen. 

1284
01:27:55,586 --> 01:27:58,919
聽得見妳的姊妹們在尖叫嗎？
Can you not hear your sisters scream？

1285
01:27:59,056 --> 01:28:01,490
妳聽不見是嗎？
Do you not hear them？

1286
01:28:02,526 --> 01:28:05,324
我們只需要一滴淚水
We need but one tear. 

1287
01:28:08,199 --> 01:28:09,496
低等的生物！
Vile creature！

1288
01:28:09,634 --> 01:28:10,932
切斷她的手指，一根一根！
Chop off her fingers，one by one！

1289
01:28:10,933 --> 01:28:12,228
窒息她！
Choke her！

1290
01:28:12,336 --> 01:28:14,964
挖出她的眼睛採集淚水！
Cut out the tears from behind the eyes！

1291
01:28:15,106 --> 01:28:16,437
妳怎麼不說話？
Where's your voice in this？

1292
01:28:17,308 --> 01:28:18,821
日出後
Maybe she'll have a change of heart 

1293
01:28:18,822 --> 01:28:20,334
她也許會改變主意
when the sun rises. 

1294
01:28:20,478 --> 01:28:22,429
對，她會被曬死
Oh，aye，she will burn，

1295
01:28:22,431 --> 01:28:24,380
但我等不及了
but I cannot wait for the sun. 

1296
01:28:24,548 --> 01:28:26,243
也許我們該升火
Perhaps we should build a fire. 

1297
01:28:26,350 --> 01:28:27,431
不
No. 

1298
01:28:27,433 --> 01:28:28,511
牧師，別想違抗我
Do not contest me，cleric. 

1299
01:28:28,653 --> 01:28:30,183
你不能折磨她
You will not torture her. 

1300
01:28:30,185 --> 01:28:31,713
我們只需要一滴淚水
We need only one tear. 

1301
01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:35,017
我會把她身上的鱗片刮下來
I will tear every scale from her body one by one if I see fit. 

1302
01:28:35,159 --> 01:28:36,717
如果你不高興，就滾回去禱告吧
If that displeases you，go pray. 

1303
01:28:36,894 --> 01:28:37,925
我錯了
I was wrong. 

1304
01:28:37,926 --> 01:28:38,958
不是每個靈魂都能救贖
Not every soul can be saved. 

1305
01:28:38,959 --> 01:28:39,988
你的就不能
Yours cannot. 

1306
01:28:40,131 --> 01:28:41,565
看哪，各位
Behold，gentlemen，

1307
01:28:41,566 --> 01:28:42,998
信仰就是這麼不可靠
a man formerly of faith. 

1308
01:28:43,134 --> 01:28:44,585
你口中的低等生物
That vile creature，as you call her，

1309
01:28:44,586 --> 01:28:46,035
遠勝你百倍
is worth a hundred of you. 

1310
01:28:46,170 --> 01:28:47,933
喔，你關心她？
Oh，you care for her？

1311
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:51,965
你喜歡她
You fancy her. 

1312
01:28:53,644 --> 01:28:56,374
別否認，我全都看在眼裡
And do not deny what is clear to my eyes. 

1313
01:28:58,182 --> 01:28:59,308
問題是...
Question is...

1314
01:29:02,486 --> 01:29:04,477
...她喜不喜歡你？
...does she fancy you？

1315
01:29:06,724 --> 01:29:08,922
天啊，她喜歡你
By God，she does. 

1316
01:29:08,923 --> 01:29:10,319
咱們走運了
We are in luck！

1317
01:29:11,729 --> 01:29:13,629
流一滴淚水...
Bring forth a tear...

1318
01:29:15,132 --> 01:29:17,657
...或是親眼看著他死
...or witness the death of this poor soul. 

1319
01:29:19,804 --> 01:29:23,240
莎琳娜，要是妳能擠出一滴淚
Syrena，if you could manage a tear，

1320
01:29:23,374 --> 01:29:24,966
我就感激不盡
I would be grateful. 

1321
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:27,902
她可憐你
Sadness，yes，

1322
01:29:28,045 --> 01:29:30,747
但並不悲傷...還沒有
but no sorrow... yet. 

1323
01:29:30,749 --> 01:29:33,449
父親！你不能殺他
Not by your hand，Father！

1324
01:29:33,617 --> 01:29:36,245
時間不會等待任何人，舵手
Time and tide wait for none.Quartermaster. 

1325
01:29:48,566 --> 01:29:52,058
好哇，人魚真的很頑固
Aye，mermaids are tough. 

1326
01:29:52,203 --> 01:29:54,228
這些怪物
The lot of them. 

1327
01:29:54,372 --> 01:29:56,574
把她跟其他人魚一樣綁起來
Tie her up like the others. 

1328
01:29:56,576 --> 01:29:58,775
把他的屍體丟掉
And get rid of this. 

1329
01:30:03,347 --> 01:30:04,843
妳有信心？
You are confident？

1330
01:30:04,845 --> 01:30:06,339
當然
Yes. 

1331
01:30:06,450 --> 01:30:09,442
我是女人，她也是
I am a woman. So is she. 

1332
01:30:17,461 --> 01:30:18,974
傑克，你玩什麼把戲？
What's your play，Jack？

1333
01:30:18,976 --> 01:30:20,487
居然和巴船長合作
Throwing in with Barbossa. 

1334
01:30:21,565 --> 01:30:23,362
有一個女生...
There is a girl...

1335
01:30:23,467 --> 01:30:25,083
...一個女人
...a female 

1336
01:30:25,084 --> 01:30:26,698
...我們的異性
...of the opposite sex. 

1337
01:30:26,804 --> 01:30:28,784
你幾時沒有過女人？
When is there not？

1338
01:30:28,786 --> 01:30:30,763
或許我應該說「小妞」
Perhaps I should say「damsel. 」

1339
01:30:30,908 --> 01:30:32,421
你要營救一個小妞？
You're rescuing a damsel？

1340
01:30:32,423 --> 01:30:33,934
好啊，這倒新鮮
Well，there's a first. 

1341
01:30:34,078 --> 01:30:37,309
對，不過就是很久以前
Yes，but it's just that I may have caused said damsel

1342
01:30:37,448 --> 01:30:39,246
我可能對這位小妞造成傷害了
some manner of harm many moons ago. 

1343
01:30:39,248 --> 01:30:41,043
說實話吧
Out with it. 

1344
01:30:41,152 --> 01:30:44,485
吉卜，這女人來自塞維利亞
Gibbs，this is the woman from Seville. 

1345
01:30:44,622 --> 01:30:47,099
啊，你假裝愛她
Ah，you pretended to love her，

1346
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:48,690
然後傷了她的心
then you left her and broke her heart. 

1347
01:30:48,692 --> 01:30:49,691
更糟
Worse. 

1348
01:30:49,692 --> 01:30:53,391
我可能有過，一下下，怎麼說...
I may have had，briefly，mind you...

1349
01:30:55,566 --> 01:30:57,148
...心動
...stirrings. 

1350
01:30:57,150 --> 01:30:58,729
心動？
Stirrings？

1351
01:30:58,836 --> 01:31:00,333
心動
Stirrings. 

1352
01:31:00,335 --> 01:31:01,582
你說什麼？
What？

1353
01:31:01,583 --> 01:31:02,829
你是說，動真情了？
Like feelings，you mean？

1354
01:31:02,973 --> 01:31:03,430
不
No，no，no. 

1355
01:31:03,431 --> 01:31:04,486
不算是真情
Not quite all the way to feelings. 

1356
01:31:04,487 --> 01:31:05,999
更像是...
More like...

1357
01:31:10,114 --> 01:31:11,848
好啦，是真情，敗給你了
All right，feelings，damn you. 

1358
01:31:11,849 --> 01:31:14,199
但你還是拋棄了她
And you left her still. 

1359
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:16,548
你真卑鄙
That's low. 

1360
01:31:17,988 --> 01:31:19,216
謝謝誇獎
Thank you. 

1361
01:31:26,130 --> 01:31:27,563
最好不要硬來
Stealth over force. 

1362
01:31:27,731 --> 01:31:31,462
考慮你的狀況，接下來讓我來吧
I'll take it from here on account of your condition. 

1363
01:31:32,603 --> 01:31:34,468
你的假腿沒被白蟻蛀掉吧？
You don't have termites，do you？

1364
01:31:34,605 --> 01:31:36,573
傑克，謝謝你的關心
I appreciate your concern，Jack，

1365
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:39,231
但我還是要跟你一起去
but I'll be keeping you company all the same. 

1366
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:40,940
少校，留在這裡
Hold here，Lieutenant Commander. 

1367
01:31:40,942 --> 01:31:42,470
等我的信號
Wait for my signal. 

1368
01:32:14,445 --> 01:32:15,492
在那裡，那一個
There. That one. 

1369
01:32:15,494 --> 01:32:16,538
他一定是首領
That be the leader. 

1370
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:19,171
記住他的帳篷，因為那...
Make note of his tent because that's where...

1371
01:32:20,651 --> 01:32:22,767
不，等等
No，wait. 

1372
01:32:22,769 --> 01:32:24,883
老天，銀杯就在那裡
By God，that must be them right there. 

1373
01:32:28,392 --> 01:32:30,622
你的劍有股怪味
Your sword smells funny. 

1374
01:32:30,794 --> 01:32:35,697
那是毒蟾蜍的毒液
Aye. Poison from the innards of poisonous toads. 

1375
01:32:35,833 --> 01:32:37,380
只要被刮傷
Just a scratch，

1376
01:32:37,381 --> 01:32:38,927
馬上沒命
you're a dead man in minutes. 

1377
01:32:39,069 --> 01:32:41,401
你能不能把劍指向別的方向？
Would you mind pointing it the other way？

1378
01:32:41,539 --> 01:32:43,302
我不喜歡蟾蜍
I don't like toads. 

1379
01:32:48,178 --> 01:32:49,896
你在幹嘛？
What are you doing？

1380
01:32:49,898 --> 01:32:51,614
安排脫逃路線啊
Planning an escape route. 

1381
01:32:51,749 --> 01:32:53,797
你不都是這樣做的？
Isn't that how you do it？

1382
01:32:53,799 --> 01:32:55,845
是啊
Yes. 

1383
01:32:55,953 --> 01:32:57,517
但有時候我會...
Or sometimes I just...

1384
01:32:57,518 --> 01:32:59,081
隨機應變
improvise. 

1385
01:33:26,083 --> 01:33:27,573
現在要做什麼？
Now what？

1386
01:33:28,452 --> 01:33:30,977
我們慢慢走出去
We stroll out，slow and steady. 

1387
01:33:31,121 --> 01:33:32,952
別當自己是外人
Just like we belong. 

1388
01:34:32,383 --> 01:34:34,516
莎琳娜，對不起
I'm sorry，Syrena. 

1389
01:34:34,548 --> 01:34:36,649
菲利普，你還活著
Philip，you're alive. 

1390
01:34:36,787 --> 01:34:38,880
對
Yes. 

1391
01:34:38,882 --> 01:34:40,985
你回來救我
You came for me. 

1392
01:34:42,826 --> 01:34:44,350
為什麼？
Why？

1393
01:34:46,463 --> 01:34:48,761
妳很不同，不是嗎？
You're different，are you not？

1394
01:34:50,968 --> 01:34:55,337
妳不是很善良？有同情心？
Do you know not of kindness？Compassion？

1395
01:35:12,523 --> 01:35:14,514
為什麼人魚
Tears of sorrow，never. 

1396
01:35:14,658 --> 01:35:17,092
悲傷痛苦沒有淚水
Mermaids be too tough for that. 

1397
01:35:17,227 --> 01:35:19,388
快樂感動才會有...
But tears of joy...

1398
01:35:20,898 --> 01:35:23,332
聽說這種淚水更有效
They say these be the more potent anyway. 

1399
01:35:23,434 --> 01:35:24,930
莎琳娜，我發誓
Syrena，on my word，

1400
01:35:24,931 --> 01:35:26,426
這與我無關
I had no part in this. 

1401
01:35:27,705 --> 01:35:29,138
放了她，你不需要她了
Let her go. You don't need her now. 

1402
01:35:29,306 --> 01:35:32,241
放了她？不行
Let her go？No. 

1403
01:35:32,376 --> 01:35:33,872
把她綁緊
Secure her bonds. 

1404
01:35:33,874 --> 01:35:35,368
讓她自生自滅
We leave her with her own. 

1405
01:35:44,922 --> 01:35:46,913
你的逃跑路線呢？
How's that escape route working？

1406
01:35:47,057 --> 01:35:50,026
現在只能靠你隨機應變啦
Here's your chance to improvise. 

1407
01:35:50,127 --> 01:35:51,458
我也想呀
I'm attempting it. 

1408
01:35:51,595 --> 01:35:54,428
只要弄鬆一隻手就行
I might be able to get a hand loose. 

1409
01:35:54,565 --> 01:35:56,829
喔，你藏了刀子，太好了
Oh，you got a knife. That's very good. 

1410
01:35:57,935 --> 01:35:59,459
比那更好
Better. 

1411
01:36:04,908 --> 01:36:06,170
我也要一支
I want one of those. 

1412
01:36:10,881 --> 01:36:12,997
敬復仇
Here's to revenge. 

1413
01:36:12,998 --> 01:36:15,113
甜蜜的復仇
Sweet and clear. 

1414
01:36:15,252 --> 01:36:17,482
什麼復仇？
Revenge？

1415
01:36:17,484 --> 01:36:19,712
老巴，行了，別裝了
Come，come，Hector. 

1416
01:36:19,823 --> 01:36:21,256
如果你想要聖盃
If you wanted the chalices，

1417
01:36:21,391 --> 01:36:24,087
你就會看出它們不見了
you'd seen they were missing and gone. 

1418
01:36:24,228 --> 01:36:27,391
你趴在那，等著偷襲黑鬍子
You were lying in wait，for Blackbeard. 

1419
01:36:29,366 --> 01:36:32,597
喬治王，私掠船，假髮
King George. Privateer. Wig. 

1420
01:36:33,737 --> 01:36:35,170
全都是裝出來的
Cheap theatrical facade. 

1421
01:36:35,305 --> 01:36:36,739
我才不信
I'm not buying it. 

1422
01:36:36,741 --> 01:36:38,172
那天晚上你又不在場
You weren't there that night. 

1423
01:36:38,308 --> 01:36:40,225
失去鬼盜船的那晚
When the Pearl was lost？

1424
01:36:40,227 --> 01:36:42,142
是被搶走，不是失去
Taken，not lost. 

1425
01:36:44,748 --> 01:36:48,878
我們在伊斯帕尼奧拉海岸被突擊
We were off the coast of Hispaniola when we came under attack. 

1426
01:36:49,052 --> 01:36:52,488
完全沒有預警也沒得交涉
No provocation nor warning nor offer of parley. 

1427
01:36:52,623 --> 01:36:55,285
我們被炮火猛烈攻擊
We were peppered with cannon fire. 

1428
01:36:56,426 --> 01:36:59,657
然後在鬼盜船下的海水開始攪動
And then the sea beneath the Pearl began to roil. 

1429
01:37:01,198 --> 01:37:03,632
鬼盜船劇烈地搖晃
The Pearl was pitching and yawing violently. 

1430
01:37:03,767 --> 01:37:05,632
每個跳板，每個欄杆
Every plank，every rail，

1431
01:37:05,769 --> 01:37:08,636
每個帆柱，一下子，開始吱吱作響
every spar，all at once，began to creak. 

1432
01:37:08,772 --> 01:37:11,798
船上的纜繩就像有生命一樣
The rigging had come to life. 

1433
01:37:11,942 --> 01:37:14,638
我們自己的船居然跟我們做對...
Our own ship turned against us...

1434
01:37:14,778 --> 01:37:18,043
...綁著船員，像蛇一樣綁著他們
...tangling the crew，wrapping around 'em like snakes. 

1435
01:37:18,182 --> 01:37:20,582
還纏上了我的腿
And wrapping around me leg. 

1436
01:37:20,751 --> 01:37:23,151
但我雙手是自由的而且手裡還握著劍
But me arms were free and me sword was to hand. 

1437
01:37:23,287 --> 01:37:26,814
我的船由我主宰，不是黑鬍子
I am the master of me ship，not Blackbeard. 

1438
01:37:26,957 --> 01:37:30,449
我的生命由我主宰，不是黑鬍子
I am the master of my fate，not Blackbeard. 

1439
01:37:31,461 --> 01:37:33,827
所以我做了我該做的事
So I did what needed done. 

1440
01:37:40,671 --> 01:37:42,605
我活下來了
I survived. 

1441
01:37:44,174 --> 01:37:48,372
...你不是來找青春之泉的
So... you're not after the Fountain. 

1442
01:37:48,512 --> 01:37:52,175
我才不管喬治王或那些
I care not for King George or tavern yarns

1443
01:37:52,316 --> 01:37:54,546
可以治癒腿傷的無稽之說
that give hope for a healed limb. 

1444
01:37:56,186 --> 01:37:58,018
我甚至願意犧牲左手
But I'd give my left arm 

1445
01:37:58,019 --> 01:37:59,849
換取殺黑鬍子的機會
for a chance at Blackbeard. 

1446
01:38:00,057 --> 01:38:01,542
不是右手？
Not your right？

1447
01:38:01,544 --> 01:38:03,026
我需要好用的右手
I need me good arm

1448
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:07,824
把毒劍刺進他的心臟
to drive my poisoned blade through his heart. 

1449
01:38:08,799 --> 01:38:11,233
老兄，你會有機會的
I'll see you get the chance，mate. 

1450
01:39:29,980 --> 01:39:31,311
俘虜逃走了
The prisoner's escaping. 

1451
01:39:38,588 --> 01:39:41,284
他逃走了！散開！找到他！
He's escaping！Fan out！Find him！

1452
01:39:41,425 --> 01:39:42,517
走！快走！
Go！Go！

1453
01:39:44,594 --> 01:39:47,461
別開槍！我要抓活的！
Hold your fire！I want him alive！

1454
01:39:55,672 --> 01:39:57,640
我覺得那就是信號了
I figured that was the signal. 

1455
01:40:40,717 --> 01:40:42,463
快走！準備出發！
Go！Prepare to move out！

1456
01:40:42,465 --> 01:40:44,209
敵人很快就會找到我們
The enemy is soon upon us. 

1457
01:40:45,956 --> 01:40:47,424
傑克，抱歉沒拿到聖盃
I'm sorry about the chalices，Jack，

1458
01:40:47,425 --> 01:40:48,891
但我在趕時間
but I've an appointment to keep. 

1459
01:40:49,026 --> 01:40:50,522
我不會回去拿的
I'll not be going back. 

1460
01:40:50,524 --> 01:40:52,018
沒必要
No need. 

1461
01:40:52,162 --> 01:40:53,675
要不要來一杯？
Shall we have a drink？

1462
01:40:53,677 --> 01:40:55,188
我們去青春之泉喝
We'll drink at the Fountain. 

1463
01:41:13,550 --> 01:41:15,331
為什麼每次見面
How is it we can never meet without  

1464
01:41:15,332 --> 01:41:17,111
你都拿著東西指著我？
you pointing something at me？

1465
01:41:18,321 --> 01:41:20,221
史派洛，你把聖盃帶來了？
You brought the chalices，Sparrow？

1466
01:41:20,357 --> 01:41:22,951
是的，喂！
Aye. Oi！

1467
01:41:26,430 --> 01:41:27,994
你還帶了個朋友
I see you brought a friend. 

1468
01:41:27,996 --> 01:41:29,558
是的
I did. 

1469
01:41:29,699 --> 01:41:32,930
獨腿者，在附近？
And the one-legged man，he is near. Aye？

1470
01:41:33,070 --> 01:41:34,469
是的
Aye. 

1471
01:41:35,272 --> 01:41:36,296
好了...
Now...

1472
01:41:36,440 --> 01:41:37,857
在我把它們拿給你之前
Before I go just handing them over，

1473
01:41:37,859 --> 01:41:39,273
你必須答應我兩個條件
I do have one or two conditions. 

1474
01:41:39,409 --> 01:41:40,439
說
Name them. 

1475
01:41:40,441 --> 01:41:41,468
第一個
Firstly，

1476
01:41:41,611 --> 01:41:42,794
把羅盤還給我
I'll be having me compass back. 

1477
01:41:42,796 --> 01:41:43,977
不，那是第二個
No，no，that's secondly. 

1478
01:41:44,114 --> 01:41:46,378
第一個，你發誓
Firstly，upon your word，

1479
01:41:46,483 --> 01:41:48,474
不傷害安潔莉卡
you will bring no harm to Angelica. 

1480
01:41:48,618 --> 01:41:50,984
史派洛，我不會向你這種人發誓
I'll make no vows to the likes of you，Sparrow. 

1481
01:41:51,121 --> 01:41:53,589
不過答應你不傷害她
But it costs me nothing to admit

1482
01:41:53,723 --> 01:41:56,590
對我沒有損失
that she was never in harm's way. 

1483
01:41:57,227 --> 01:41:59,422
第二個，比第一個重要
Secondly then，priorly firstly，

1484
01:41:59,563 --> 01:42:01,190
把羅盤還給我
I will be having me compass back. 

1485
01:42:02,099 --> 01:42:04,124
拜託啦？那是我應得的
Please？I do deserve it. 

1486
01:42:04,267 --> 01:42:06,013
你知道那臭豬
Do you have any idea how difficult 

1487
01:42:06,014 --> 01:42:07,759
有多難綁嗎？
it was to catch that filthy pig？

1488
01:42:07,904 --> 01:42:09,087
不是兩條腿的
Not the big one，

1489
01:42:09,088 --> 01:42:10,270
是那四條腿的
the four-legged one. 

1490
01:42:13,710 --> 01:42:14,965
謝謝妳
Thank you. 

1491
01:42:14,966 --> 01:42:16,221
第三個
And thirdly，

1492
01:42:16,222 --> 01:42:17,476
黑鬍子先生
Mr. Beard，

1493
01:42:17,614 --> 01:42:20,449
有時候呀，不是常常
there are times，not very often，

1494
01:42:20,450 --> 01:42:23,544
在反省我的滔天罪行時
when I do reflect upon my heinous misdeeds. 

1495
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:25,453
最惡劣的
Chief among them，

1496
01:42:25,454 --> 01:42:27,986
是我對待吉卜先生的態度
I note how poorly I have treated Mr. Gibbs，

1497
01:42:28,125 --> 01:42:29,456
我忠心耿耿的大副
my loyal first mate. 

1498
01:42:29,458 --> 01:42:30,787
對啊！現在你才想到...
Aye！Now you bring it up...

1499
01:42:30,927 --> 01:42:32,719
留下他在監獄裡腐爛
Left him to rot in jail，I did. 

1500
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:33,623
我不在乎
Didn't care. 

1501
01:42:33,763 --> 01:42:35,318
現在還是不在乎
Still don't. 

1502
01:42:35,319 --> 01:42:36,873
但，這次
But，point being，

1503
01:42:36,874 --> 01:42:38,427
你必須放過他
you must let him go free. 

1504
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:41,954
就這些？
Is that it？

1505
01:42:41,956 --> 01:42:43,637
我想是的
I think so. 

1506
01:42:43,773 --> 01:42:45,141
快決定，豬要是跑了
Quick，or the pig runs，

1507
01:42:45,142 --> 01:42:46,509
祝好運找到聖盃
and good luck getting those chalices. 

1508
01:42:46,510 --> 01:42:48,110
傑克，如果我是你，我一定...
Jack，if it's all the same to you，I'd be just as...

1509
01:42:48,111 --> 01:42:49,442
同意
Done. 

1510
01:42:49,546 --> 01:42:50,774
放了那頭豬
Release the swine. 

1511
01:42:56,553 --> 01:42:58,186
如果，你們不介意
Perhaps，if you don't mind，

1512
01:42:58,187 --> 01:42:59,818
我想跟著去...
I could tag along with you folk for a...

1513
01:43:02,559 --> 01:43:04,823
老兄，這會指引你奔向自由
This will lead you to freedom，mate. 

1514
01:43:11,501 --> 01:43:12,935
我發誓
I could have swore 

1515
01:43:12,936 --> 01:43:14,368
青春之泉就在這附近
it was somewhere right around here. 

1516
01:44:44,461 --> 01:44:46,827
我們不能停下
We must not stop. 

1517
01:45:04,147 --> 01:45:05,580
死路
Dead end. 

1518
01:45:06,583 --> 01:45:08,517
死路
Dead. End. 

1519
01:45:09,219 --> 01:45:10,618
死路
Dead end. 

1520
01:45:11,655 --> 01:45:13,540
傑克，我覺得
Jack，I'm starting to think  

1521
01:45:13,541 --> 01:45:15,424
你不知道地點
you don't know where you're going. 

1522
01:45:15,425 --> 01:45:18,258
俗話說，重要的是旅程不是結果
It is not the destination so much as the journey，they say. 

1523
01:45:19,462 --> 01:45:20,929
聖盃，拜託
Chalices，if you please. 

1524
01:45:32,942 --> 01:45:34,466
後退
Stand back. 

1525
01:45:56,833 --> 01:45:58,391
傑克...
Jack...

1526
01:45:58,535 --> 01:46:00,469
...你有沒有，真的...
...have you ever，in fact...

1527
01:46:00,603 --> 01:46:03,351
...親眼見到
...seen with your own eyes

1528
01:46:03,352 --> 01:46:06,098
...青春之泉？
...the Fountain of Youth？

1529
01:46:06,276 --> 01:46:08,437
抱歉，請重複妳的問題？
I'm sorry，could you repeat the question，please？

1530
01:46:08,611 --> 01:46:10,078
舵手
Quartermaster. 

1531
01:46:11,014 --> 01:46:11,981
不！
No，no！

1532
01:46:15,652 --> 01:46:17,779
等等！
Wait，wait！Wait. 

1533
01:46:21,057 --> 01:46:25,517
「生命...之水」
「Aqua...de Vida.」

1534
01:47:04,868 --> 01:47:07,393
石頭先生...
Master Scrum...

1535
01:47:07,537 --> 01:47:08,971
...可不可以？
...do you mind？

1536
01:47:08,973 --> 01:47:10,404
閣下？
Squire？

1537
01:48:09,098 --> 01:48:11,089
真漂亮
So beautiful. 

1538
01:48:50,573 --> 01:48:53,201
史派洛，我是第一個喝的
Sparrow，I'll be the first to taste those waters. 

1539
01:48:57,680 --> 01:48:59,272
父親
Father. 

1540
01:49:02,552 --> 01:49:04,850
獨腿人
The one-legged man. 

1541
01:49:07,390 --> 01:49:09,370
你把他帶來這裡
You brought him here. 

1542
01:49:09,372 --> 01:49:11,349
我會這麼做？
Would I do that？

1543
01:49:11,494 --> 01:49:13,587
愛德華汀奇！
Edward Teach！

1544
01:49:13,730 --> 01:49:17,029
對於你在公海上犯下的罪行
For crimes committed on the high seas，

1545
01:49:17,166 --> 01:49:21,034
奉國王陛下之名授予我的權力...
by the authority granted me by His Majesty the King...

1546
01:49:21,170 --> 01:49:24,367
...以及個人滿意的優厚條件...
...and with a goodly amount of personal satisfaction...

1547
01:49:24,507 --> 01:49:27,567
...依法逮捕你
...I hereby place you in the custody of the court，

1548
01:49:27,710 --> 01:49:31,043
你現在是我的犯人了
and declare you to be my prisoner. 

1549
01:49:32,081 --> 01:49:35,608
我的路到盡頭了，是這麼說吧？
My trick's out，is that it？

1550
01:49:35,752 --> 01:49:40,189
你犯的罪行包括有，海盜罪，叛國罪
Such crimes do include，but are not limited to，piracy，treason，

1551
01:49:40,290 --> 01:49:44,454
謀殺罪，最可惡的酷刑罪
murder，torture of the most heinous sort，

1552
01:49:44,594 --> 01:49:48,530
還有殘忍剝奪別人右腿罪
including the brutal theft of one used，twisted，hairy right leg. 

1553
01:49:49,299 --> 01:49:53,998
你...敢不敢面對這把劍？
You... dare face this sword？

1554
01:49:54,170 --> 01:49:56,604
離你的船這麼遠？當然敢
This far away from your ship？Aye. 

1555
01:49:56,739 --> 01:50:01,472
我感到命運冷酷的氣息在我頸後
Aye. That be the cold breath of fate I feel down my nape. 

1556
01:50:01,611 --> 01:50:07,277
以上帝之名，我會和你決一死鬥
But I'll have one last fight，by God. 

1557
01:50:07,417 --> 01:50:09,146
殺了他們！
Kill 'em all！

1558
01:50:10,787 --> 01:50:12,584
等一下
Hang on a minute. 

1559
01:50:12,722 --> 01:50:14,024
我只是...
I just... 

1560
01:50:14,025 --> 01:50:16,624
我只是想搞清楚一些事
I just need to understand something. 

1561
01:50:16,759 --> 01:50:18,443
來到這
Right，so，

1562
01:50:18,444 --> 01:50:20,126
你們要打他們
you will fight against them，

1563
01:50:20,263 --> 01:50:21,594
他們要打你們
they will fight against you. 

1564
01:50:21,731 --> 01:50:25,428
就因為他的腿被他砍了？
All on account of him wanting to kill him？

1565
01:50:25,568 --> 01:50:27,536
這什麼邏輯？
Where is the sense？

1566
01:50:27,537 --> 01:50:29,504
我沒說錯吧
Exactly. 

1567
01:50:29,639 --> 01:50:32,241
這樣吧，讓他們單挑
I say，let them fight each other， 

1568
01:50:32,242 --> 01:50:35,261
我們別插手，邊看，邊喝酒
while we lay back，watch，have a drink，

1569
01:50:35,262 --> 01:50:36,979
順便賭賭輸贏！
place some wagers！

1570
01:50:38,081 --> 01:50:39,378
好
Aye. 

1571
01:50:41,951 --> 01:50:42,765
殺了他們！
Kill 'em！

1572
01:50:42,767 --> 01:50:43,578
不留餘地！
No quarter！

1573
01:51:14,050 --> 01:51:15,711
滾開！
Get off me！

1574
01:51:48,685 --> 01:51:49,709
石頭，聖盃！
Scrum，the chalices！

1575
01:51:51,854 --> 01:51:52,980
還有人魚淚水！跟我來！
And the tear！Follow！

1576
01:51:56,993 --> 01:51:58,187
殺呀！
Fight！

1577
01:51:59,095 --> 01:52:00,282
拿過來
Hand it over. 

1578
01:52:00,283 --> 01:52:02,656
人魚淚水，這才是好樣的
The tear. There's a good lad.

1579
01:52:02,765 --> 01:52:05,097
比起怕你，我更怕她
I'm more afraid of her than I am of you. 

1580
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:13,040
拿過來，這才是好樣的
Hand it over. There's a good lad. 

1581
01:52:16,412 --> 01:52:18,278
聖盃，拜託
The chalices，if you please. 

1582
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:20,143
傑克，抱歉
Sorry，Jack. 

1583
01:52:20,316 --> 01:52:22,432
我跟你說過，我需要歲月
I told you，I need years. 

1584
01:52:22,434 --> 01:52:24,548
現在，你的就行了
And now，yours will do. 

1585
01:52:32,462 --> 01:52:33,690
石頭！
Scrum！

1586
01:52:55,351 --> 01:52:56,818
莎琳娜...
Syrena...

1587
01:53:00,556 --> 01:53:03,320
主啊，你不能帶她走
Oh God，you will not take her. 

1588
01:53:03,459 --> 01:53:05,939
如果你帶走了她
If you have taken her，

1589
01:53:05,941 --> 01:53:08,419
請讓她回來
you will give her back. 

1590
01:53:08,564 --> 01:53:10,930
讓她回來...
Give her back...

1591
01:53:11,067 --> 01:53:13,934
讓她回來，求求?
Give her back，please. Please. 

1592
01:53:37,527 --> 01:53:40,291
我以為命運會眷顧你，嗯？
I expected fate to put up more of a fight，eh？

1593
01:53:57,146 --> 01:53:59,046
是我被擊倒的話
I will not have that smile on your face 

1594
01:53:59,047 --> 01:54:00,946
我肯定笑不出來
as I strike you down. 

1595
01:54:02,351 --> 01:54:05,445
愛德華汀奇，轉頭看吧
Take a gander，Edward Teach. 

1596
01:54:35,985 --> 01:54:39,284
這塊土地永遠屬於光榮的
This land is hereby forever claimed in the glorious name

1597
01:54:39,455 --> 01:54:42,015
喬治王陛下名下...
of His Majesty King George...

1598
01:54:48,264 --> 01:54:51,199
你的勇敢將載入史冊
Someone make a note of that man's bravery. 

1599
01:54:58,174 --> 01:55:01,905
小姐，聖盃，請拿給我
Senorita，the chalices，por favor. 

1600
01:55:18,594 --> 01:55:21,427
只有上帝能賜予永生
Only God can grant eternal life，

1601
01:55:21,429 --> 01:55:24,260
不是這個異教之泉
not this pagan water. 

1602
01:55:35,311 --> 01:55:38,803
摧毀這座異教寺院！
Men，destroy this profane temple！

1603
01:55:41,550 --> 01:55:42,881
青春之泉！
The Fountain！

1604
01:55:56,933 --> 01:55:58,457
你是個笨蛋
You are a fool. 

1605
01:55:58,601 --> 01:56:00,251
你在這奡M找的
You seek in this place what 

1606
01:56:00,252 --> 01:56:01,900
只有信仰才能給你
only faith can provide. 

1607
01:56:02,004 --> 01:56:03,284
信仰？
Faith？

1608
01:56:03,285 --> 01:56:04,673
的確，可以光明的讓你看見
In faith，there is light enough to see

1609
01:56:04,674 --> 01:56:06,938
但也可以黑暗的讓你失明
but darkness enough to blind. 

1610
01:56:10,546 --> 01:56:12,810
這是什麼妖術？
What devilry is this？

1611
01:56:16,786 --> 01:56:18,083
這是為了鬼盜船
For the Pearl. 

1612
01:56:18,085 --> 01:56:19,380
你做了什麼？
What have you done？

1613
01:56:22,925 --> 01:56:25,325
安潔莉卡！不要！劍有毒！
Angelica！Don't！It's poison！

1614
01:56:29,966 --> 01:56:32,298
我不會傻到沒有一點優勢
I'm not such the fool to take on Blackbeard

1615
01:56:32,435 --> 01:56:35,836
就來抓黑鬍子的
without a little venomous advantage. 

1616
01:56:37,139 --> 01:56:38,629
傑克！
Jack！

1617
01:56:50,453 --> 01:56:52,652
我宣佈黑鬍子的船和船員
I claim Blackbeard's ship and crew，

1618
01:56:52,655 --> 01:56:54,373
以及這把劍
and this sword，

1619
01:56:54,374 --> 01:56:56,091
賠償我失去的腿！
payment for my missing limb！

1620
01:57:10,506 --> 01:57:11,905
抓好了！拉！
Hang on！Pull！

1621
01:57:57,186 --> 01:57:59,552
別浪費了我的淚水
Do not waste my tear. 

1622
01:58:29,018 --> 01:58:30,082
喝下這杯
Drink this. 

1623
01:58:30,083 --> 01:58:31,145
這杯有人魚淚水
This one has the tear. 

1624
01:58:31,287 --> 01:58:32,283
你必須喝另一杯
You must drink the other. 

1625
01:58:32,285 --> 01:58:33,278
不！
No！

1626
01:58:34,056 --> 01:58:35,672
你們倆沒法同時救
I cannot save you both. 

1627
01:58:35,674 --> 01:58:37,287
你們得犧牲一個
One of you must sacrifice. 

1628
01:58:38,227 --> 01:58:41,321
你喝吧，父親，救贖你的靈魂
You take it，Father，for your soul. 

1629
01:58:43,365 --> 01:58:46,084
汀奇船長，她快死了
Captain Teach，she's dying. 

1630
01:58:46,086 --> 01:58:48,803
你得救你的女兒
You must save your daughter. 

1631
01:58:49,972 --> 01:58:52,770
這杯是死？
This one takes life？

1632
01:58:52,908 --> 01:58:54,773
這杯是生？
This one has the tear and gives life？

1633
01:58:54,910 --> 01:58:56,172
對，快喝啊！
Aye，hurry！

1634
01:59:05,087 --> 01:59:09,353
安潔莉卡...我的女兒，救救我
Angelica...Save me，my child. 

1635
01:59:11,260 --> 01:59:12,693
不
No. 

1636
01:59:21,403 --> 01:59:22,836
父親，我愛你
I love you，Father. 

1637
01:59:35,818 --> 01:59:37,445
等等
Wait a minute. 

1638
01:59:39,622 --> 01:59:42,455
我好像弄反了
In fact，it might have been the other way around. 

1639
01:59:43,292 --> 01:59:45,209
這杯才有淚水
This cup had the tear，

1640
01:59:45,210 --> 01:59:47,126
你喝的那杯沒有
that one had the other bit. 

1641
01:59:47,229 --> 01:59:48,491
騙子！
Trickster！

1642
01:59:48,631 --> 01:59:49,564
惡魔！
Devil！

1643
01:59:49,566 --> 01:59:50,496
父親！
Father！

1644
01:59:57,506 --> 01:59:59,099
混蛋！你怎麼可以這樣？
You bastard！How could you？

1645
02:00:00,042 --> 02:00:01,643
妳的父親救了妳
Your father saved you. 

1646
02:00:01,644 --> 02:00:04,169
也許他的靈魂得到救贖了，嗯？
Perhaps his soul is now redeemed，eh？

1647
02:01:04,974 --> 02:01:07,101
你受傷了
You are hurt. 

1648
02:01:09,311 --> 02:01:11,245
只是肉體
In body only. 

1649
02:01:12,915 --> 02:01:15,031
我的心靈很平靜...
My mind is at peace...

1650
02:01:15,032 --> 02:01:17,147
因為妳
because of you. 

1651
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:19,654
我？
Me？

1652
02:01:19,656 --> 02:01:21,087
對
Yes. 

1653
02:01:22,091 --> 02:01:24,491
我曾經迷失
I was lost. 

1654
02:01:25,461 --> 02:01:30,125
海風，潮汐...
The wind，the tides...

1655
02:01:30,266 --> 02:01:33,326
...它們應該可以使人恢復信仰
...they ought to renew a man's faith. 

1656
02:01:34,903 --> 02:01:36,837
但使我恢復信仰的，只有妳
But for me，only you. 

1657
02:01:37,740 --> 02:01:41,471
菲利浦，我可以救你
Philip，I can save you. 

1658
02:01:41,610 --> 02:01:44,579
只要你要求我
You need only ask. 

1659
02:01:46,015 --> 02:01:48,416
我只要求一件事
I seek but one thing. 

1660
02:01:48,418 --> 02:01:50,816
什麼事？
What is that？

1661
02:01:51,820 --> 02:01:54,186
寬恕
Forgiveness. 

1662
02:01:54,323 --> 02:01:55,990
要不是我
If not for me，

1663
02:01:55,991 --> 02:01:57,656
妳不會被抓住
you would never have been captured. 

1664
02:01:57,793 --> 02:01:59,454
要求吧
Ask. 

1665
02:02:01,330 --> 02:02:03,161
原諒我？
Forgive me？

1666
02:02:28,290 --> 02:02:29,518
我恨你
I hate you. 

1667
02:02:29,658 --> 02:02:31,990
救過妳命的笨蛋？
The bloke who saved your life？

1668
02:02:32,127 --> 02:02:33,726
我擁有的歲月
The years I possess，

1669
02:02:33,727 --> 02:02:35,324
偷竊自我的父親！
stolen from my own father！

1670
02:02:35,464 --> 02:02:36,977
我只是幫黑鬍子
I only helped Blackbeard do what 

1671
02:02:36,978 --> 02:02:38,490
盡了父親該做的事
any father should have done. 

1672
02:02:38,634 --> 02:02:41,831
你既殘忍又無知
You are cruel and ignorant. 

1673
02:02:45,541 --> 02:02:49,341
一把手槍，一顆子彈
One pistol，one shot. 

1674
02:02:49,478 --> 02:02:51,708
在我餓死前自殺？
To kill myself before I starve？

1675
02:02:51,847 --> 02:02:53,405
親愛的，我信不過妳
There's no trusting you，love. 

1676
02:02:53,549 --> 02:02:56,017
再說，這是繁忙的貿易路線
Besides，this is a well-traveled trade route. 

1677
02:02:56,151 --> 02:02:57,743
妳可以給經過的船隻打信號
You can signal a passing ship. 

1678
02:02:57,886 --> 02:03:01,344
或者妳可以飲彈自盡，隨妳便
Or you can just bite the proverbial bullet，as it were. 

1679
02:03:01,490 --> 02:03:03,082
那我又要怎麼掙脫這些繩索？
And how will I get free of these bonds？

1680
02:03:03,225 --> 02:03:05,989
半個小時前妳就掙脫繩索了
You broke free of your bonds half an hour ago，

1681
02:03:06,095 --> 02:03:08,928
正在想著怎麼樣向我發動襲擊
waiting for the precise moment to pounce. 

1682
02:03:11,633 --> 02:03:13,328
傑克，承認吧
Admit it，Jack. 

1683
02:03:13,435 --> 02:03:15,403
你還愛著我
You still love me. 

1684
02:03:15,405 --> 02:03:17,371
如果你有妹妹和一隻狗
If you had a sister and a dog，

1685
02:03:17,506 --> 02:03:19,804
我會選擇那隻狗
I'd choose the dog. 

1686
02:03:19,975 --> 02:03:23,342
寶藏！有個裝滿珠寶的箱子！
Treasure！There is a chest with jewels！

1687
02:03:23,445 --> 02:03:25,709
珠寶擁有控制風向和潮汐的力量！
Jewels with the power to rule the wind and tide！

1688
02:03:25,848 --> 02:03:27,395
妳在亂掰！
You're making that up！

1689
02:03:27,397 --> 02:03:28,942
等等...
Wait...

1690
02:03:29,752 --> 02:03:31,601
我懷孕了
I am with child. 

1691
02:03:31,602 --> 02:03:33,449
是你的
Yours. 

1692
02:03:34,690 --> 02:03:36,089
我不記得我們有過...
I don't recall that we ever had...

1693
02:03:36,225 --> 02:03:37,590
那次你喝醉了！
You were drunk！

1694
02:03:37,592 --> 02:03:38,955
我從沒醉到那種程度
I've actually never been that drunk. 

1695
02:03:39,094 --> 02:03:40,220
等等！
Wait！

1696
02:03:42,097 --> 02:03:44,156
我有些話想對你說
There is something I want to say to you. 

1697
02:03:44,333 --> 02:03:48,497
從一見面起我就想說
Something I wanted to say from the moment we first met. 

1698
02:03:49,438 --> 02:03:50,564
說吧
Go on，then. 

1699
02:03:52,908 --> 02:03:54,239
我愛你
I love you. 

1700
02:03:57,813 --> 02:03:59,644
我也愛妳
As do I. 

1701
02:03:59,782 --> 02:04:01,511
永遠都愛
Always have. 

1702
02:04:01,512 --> 02:04:03,240
永遠不變
Always will. 

1703
02:04:07,756 --> 02:04:09,246
我得走了
I gotta go. 

1704
02:04:09,391 --> 02:04:10,415
傑克！
Jack！

1705
02:04:12,728 --> 02:04:14,320
我跟你還沒完！
This is not over！

1706
02:04:15,397 --> 02:04:16,455
傑克！
Jack！

1707
02:04:26,041 --> 02:04:27,531
打偏啦！
Missed！

1708
02:04:42,825 --> 02:04:45,851
這個「復仇」屬於我
The Revenge is mine. 

1709
02:04:52,534 --> 02:04:54,001
先生...
Sir...

1710
02:04:56,472 --> 02:04:58,337
我們在甲板下發現這個
We found this below decks. 

1711
02:05:24,433 --> 02:05:26,697
全體船員！迎風航行！
All hands！Ply to windward！

1712
02:05:26,835 --> 02:05:30,396
揚起船帆，你們這些蟑螂！
Get cracking，ye blooming cockroaches！

1713
02:05:33,108 --> 02:05:35,702
雖然國王待我不薄
The Crown served me well. 

1714
02:05:35,844 --> 02:05:38,836
不過現在，以海神及天神之名...
But now，by the gods of sea and sky...

1715
02:05:38,981 --> 02:05:43,077
...向龜島全速前進！
...make way for Tortuga！

1716
02:05:54,196 --> 02:05:56,305
吉卜，你這邪惡，糊塗的醉鬼
Gibbs，you filthy，besotted shellback

1717
02:05:56,307 --> 02:05:57,359
你搞定啦！
you made it！

1718
02:05:57,499 --> 02:05:59,057
對啊！
Aye！

1719
02:05:59,201 --> 02:06:00,793
我相信我們聯手
And I trust we managed a profit

1720
02:06:00,936 --> 02:06:03,018
成功了是不是？
from our joint enterprise？

1721
02:06:03,020 --> 02:06:05,100
睜亮你的眼睛
Feast your eyes. 

1722
02:06:10,178 --> 02:06:12,703
羅盤指引我的方向很正確
The compass led me straight and true. 

1723
02:06:12,848 --> 02:06:14,839
那黑鬍子看船的手下呢？
What of Blackbeard's men guarding the ship？

1724
02:06:14,950 --> 02:06:18,852
我用新幾內亞的絕招擺平了
I employed the selfsame maneuver we perfected in New Guinea. 

1725
02:06:18,954 --> 02:06:23,050
沒弄走全部艦隊有點可惜
Seemed a shame to leave an entire fleet behind. 

1726
02:06:23,191 --> 02:06:25,250
是有點可惜
Shame indeed. 

1727
02:06:37,205 --> 02:06:38,570
我討厭那隻猴子
I hate that monkey. 

1728
02:06:38,707 --> 02:06:42,143
鬼盜船...要怎樣把她弄出來？
So，the Pearl...Any idea how to get her out？

1729
02:06:42,277 --> 02:06:43,790
需要一把十字弓
We shall need a crossbow，

1730
02:06:43,791 --> 02:06:45,303
一個砂時計，三隻山羊
an hourglass，three goats. 

1731
02:06:45,447 --> 02:06:46,960
一人唸咒語同時
One of us must learn to play the trumpet whilst 

1732
02:06:46,962 --> 02:06:48,473
另一人裝神弄鬼...
the other one goes like this...

1733
02:06:48,984 --> 02:06:50,634
我認識一個有山羊的人
I know a man with a goat. 

1734
02:06:50,636 --> 02:06:52,283
你把山羊弄來，我擅長裝神弄鬼
Good. I can go like this. 

1735
02:06:54,923 --> 02:06:56,584
傑克，我不明白...
Jack，I have to ask...

1736
02:06:56,725 --> 02:06:58,159
你有了聖盃
You had the chalices，

1737
02:06:58,160 --> 02:06:59,592
青春之泉，人魚淚水...
the water，the tear...

1738
02:06:59,728 --> 02:07:02,253
你大可以擁有永生的
You could have lived maybe forever. 

1739
02:07:02,397 --> 02:07:04,365
青春之泉是一個考驗，吉卜
The Fountain does test you，Gibbs. 

1740
02:07:04,533 --> 02:07:05,784
永遠不要妄圖知道
But better to not know  

1741
02:07:05,785 --> 02:07:07,434
自己的生命終點
which moment may be your last. 

1742
02:07:07,569 --> 02:07:09,594
生命的奧義
Every morsel of your entire being

1743
02:07:09,738 --> 02:07:12,832
就是活在當下
alive to the infinite mystery of it all. 

1744
02:07:12,975 --> 02:07:15,500
誰說我就不能永生，嗯？
And who's to say I won't live forever，eh？

1745
02:07:15,644 --> 02:07:18,772
我是青春之泉的發現者耶
Discoverer of the Fountain of Youth. 

1746
02:07:18,914 --> 02:07:21,815
我本身就成為一個傳奇了，吉卜
I have no say in it，Gibbs. 

1747
02:07:21,950 --> 02:07:23,941
我是個不折不扣的海盜
It's a pirate's life for me. 

1748
02:07:24,886 --> 02:07:26,376
了了？
Savvy？
