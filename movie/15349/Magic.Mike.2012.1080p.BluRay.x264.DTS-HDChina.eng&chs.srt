Tell me about being an entrepreneur.
谈谈你的其他生意吧?

1018
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,953
It's "entrepreneur" actually. It's, uh, French.
发音应该是像法语那样

1019
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:35,123
You know about the roofing, and I got a mobile-detailing thing.
修屋顶你是知道的 我还找了个汽车服务的活

- 最快乐的?  - 当然除了钱

除了钱的话 最快乐的就是每天在海滩边醒来 做着喜欢的家具

Really? Tables and chairs, that kind of thing?
真的? 就做做桌子椅子这些?

1030
01:12:06,446 --> 01:12:09,365
Whatever. Anything. Everything. But custom, one-of-a-kind stuff.
任何家具 任何东西 但是绝对是定制的 独一无二的

1031
01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:13,202
Not the knock-off stuff you see in people's kitchens from time to time.
绝不会是你在厨房看到的那些仿制品

1032
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:16,122
Hey. I don't have a custom furniture-maker man.
说起来 我都没有一个可以定做家具的工匠

1033
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:17,748
- Well, now you do.  - Okay? Heh.

- 业务已经开展了吗? 怎么还没开始?  - 唉

等银行的贷款利率下降 我就会着手弄了

1036
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:26,591
Look, I've been saving for six years.
其实我都存了六年的钱了

1037
01:12:26,758 --> 01:12:29,677
Why do you think I'm doing all these stupid businesses...
你以为我干嘛要做这些傻乎乎的生意...

1038
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:34,974

- 哇哦 一万三 很可观啦  - 呵呵

1040
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,605
There were some fives in there.
瞧我钱包里全是5块的零钞

1041
01:12:40,772 --> 01:12:42,106
No 20s?
没20的?

You don't want to know what I have to do for 20s.
你不会想知道我对20的钞票都做了些什么?

- Don't be mad.  - I'm not mad.
- 先别急啊  - 我没急

1048
01:12:56,496 --> 01:13:00,333
I'm not trying to tell him what to do. I just don't like it.
我可不是在指责他 我只是不喜欢

1049
01:13:02,169 --> 01:13:07,506
Did you just...? I want to clear something up. Did you just take my advice?
你有...? 我想弄清楚 你采纳了我的建议吗?
