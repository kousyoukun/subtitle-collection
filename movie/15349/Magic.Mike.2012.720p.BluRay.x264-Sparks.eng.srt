2
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:10,968
Let's fucking get
it on right now. Let's go.

3
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:15,556
Come on. Come on.

4
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,391
Here. Here.

5
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,602
Now, I want to go over a few rules
with y'all tonight.

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,522
Ain't that all right?
Don't worry about it. Rule number one.

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,483
This is the
"What can you touch and not touch" rules.

8
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:31,905
Can you touch this?

9
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,326
No, no, no.

10
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,829
Second touch.

11
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:45,210
Can you touch this?

12
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:48,422
No, no, no.

13
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,549
And finally....

14
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:55,637
Last one, ladies. Can you touch this?

15
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,849
Can you ever touch this?

16
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:03,187
Well, that's who the law says
that you cannot touch.

17
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:08,233
But I think I see a lot of lawbreakers
up in this house tonight.

18
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,113
And I don't see a cop in sight.

19
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,490
All right?

20
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,539
Oh.

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,150
You know, I gotta go commando today
because someone...

22
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,195
...ripped off my favorite pair
of panties last night.

23
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,241
- Hey. It's not funny.
- Heh, oh, sorry, heh.

24
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,244
- They were my grandma's.
- They were not your grandma's.

25
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,453
They could have been.

26
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:05,332
Can you throw me, uh,
that shirt right there?

27
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,918
Hey, what are we gonna do about her?

28
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,878
I don't know.

29
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,421
What was her name again?

30
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,799
What? I don't...

31
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,968
I'm sorry. What's her name?

32
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,970
Uh.

33
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,221
You don't even know.

34
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,306
- I do.
- You found her. You have to remember her.

35
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,392
- I know her name.
- What is it, then?

36
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,018
It's....

37
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,229
Penelope.

38
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,900
Whatever her name was, she was fun.

39
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,944
That's a cool table. Where'd you get it?

40
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:37,781
That's just some old shit that blew
up on a beach after the last hurricane.

41
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,616
- You made that?
- Hmm?

42
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,993
You should sell these things.

43
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,831
Tsk, thank you. That's actually the idea.
Mike's Custom Furniture Concepts.

44
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,167
But the market hasn't really hit
the sweet spot yet.

45
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,504
Hm, I'm waiting for the bank to make
the competitive loans I'm looking for...

46
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,464
...and then I'll swoop in.

47
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,133
Cool.

48
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,094
I'm going to get out of here.
You guys are good?

49
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,638
What? You're just gonna leave us?

50
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:06,476
Yeah. What, are you gonna steal a bunch
of my shit or something?

51
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,605
Probably. That's what strangers do.

52
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:13,650
- Don't do that... maybe?
- Okay.

53
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,611
- Okay.
- Okay.

54
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,279
So I'm going to see you again?

55
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,949
Tsk, uh, yeah, probably.
I don't know. I'll, uh, call you.

56
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,413
Bye.

57
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,230
Where's George and the guys?

58
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,733
They fucked me and took another gig
last minute. So I got these guys.

59
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,068
Where'd you get them?

60
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,113
Uh, you know, ah, industry referrals.

61
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,532
- My dick. You got them off Craigslist?
- Heh.

62
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,867
I can't have fucking union guys
around here...

63
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,412
...barking about benefits and shit.
Give me a break.

64
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,998
So, what am I supposed to do in there?

65
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:54,167
- Hey, you Sol? Sal. Adam.
- Sal.

66
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:58,005
Oh, Adam, how you doing? This is Mike.
You guys are gonna be working together.

67
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,882
Give me a minute?
I want to straighten something out there.

68
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,592
You can hop up there.

69
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,014
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.
- What?

70
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,849
He's wearing fucking tennis shoes.
He doesn't know...

71
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,853
Ah, heh, do me a favor, go up there
and do it for 14 bucks an hour.

72
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,896
I'm gonna do it for 20 bucks an hour.

73
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,524
- I'll give you 18.
- Mm-mm.

74
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,192
Don't fuck with me.
You're like my son.

75
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,778
The son which you're gonna pay
$20 an hour.

76
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,004
What's up?

77
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,678
You ever, uh, tiled a roof before?

78
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,181
- No.
- Fuck.

79
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,392
How'd you get this job, anyways?

80
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,061
Craigslist.

81
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,731
And you put on your post
that you'd tiled houses before?

82
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,274
Yeah.

83
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,776
Right, ugh.

84
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,861
So, what do you got in your bag?

85
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,782
- Why don't you open it up?
- There's nothing in it.

86
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,160
Why don't you open the fucking bag
before I open your fucking head up?

87
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,751
I got a nice ham, cheese sandwich....

88
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,462
You know how to read, huh?

89
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,964
One Pepsi a day. Read the cooler.

90
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:27,511
I'm gonna do my inventory. If I come
up short, I'm coming right to you.

91
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,600
Is it dead?

92
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,102
What's that?

93
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,855
I can try to jump you off if you want,
but it's not the battery.

94
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,609
I think you're probably fucked.

95
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,737
Just tell them if they
want to get into this...

96
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,573
...be up there. I'll see you at the Amp.
All right. Later.

97
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,620
What are you doing? Stop. What the fuck
are you doing, man?

98
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,081
Sorry.

99
00:06:56,249 --> 00:07:00,210
It's new. It's gonna stay new
if you don't rip off the damn plastic.

100
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,711
Why do you have that?

101
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,298
Because it protects it. I'm going to
rip it off when I'm ready to sell it.

102
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,842
It'll be like brand-new.

103
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,973
Where are you from?

104
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,767
Citrus Springs.

105
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,645
Did you play ball?

106
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,648
Uh, yeah. Strong safety.

107
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,569
You don't look like a strong safety.

108
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:32,492
I gave that, uh, college thing the college try.
Didn't quite work out.

109
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:38,290
Couldn't resist the lure
of the roofing business?

110
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,834
Yeah, that and the lure
of my sister's couch.

111
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:52,137
Can you do me a favor and drop me
off at my car tonight?

112
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,556
No, I'm sorry. I'm going to dinner.

113
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:58,351
I can take you tomorrow morning, though.
What time do you have to be at work?

114
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,522
I need to talk to you about that, heh.
The foreman, uh...

115
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,860
...he accused me of stealing.
So I fucking quit.

116
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,487
- What?
- Yeah, but I have....

117
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,698
Well, I had that interview at T-Mobile.

118
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:15,702
So, uh, yeah. They asked me to wear
a fucking tie.

119
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,705
You know how I feel about wearing
a fucking tie.

120
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,875
Why don't you just wear a tie?

121
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,378
Sorry. You know what my rules are.

122
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,838
Oh, God, brother.

123
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,508
What? I also...

124
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:31,843
...could do....

125
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,679
- What?
- What?

126
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,765
- What did you say?
- What did you hear?

127
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,977
You're doing that thing.
You're doing that game.

128
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,063
- What game?
- No. You do that all the time.

129
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,397
It's not working anymore.

130
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,983
- Talking about games, I could be a gamer.
- Oh, yeah.

131
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,861
- And I could sell it to people.
- You'll make so much money.

132
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,239
- I could be the voice of the game.
- Even more money.

133
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,033
I have a very good voice.
I do great impressions.

134
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,203
You do do good impressions.
What was the one you did last night?

135
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,498
- I'm not going to do it now.
- Heh, do it again. Do it again.

136
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,083
- No.
- Come on.

137
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,251
Listen to me.

138
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,878
These are my tortillas.

139
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,006
Get in the chopper.
John Connor, come with me.

140
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,801
- Argh!
- Okay. All right.

141
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,179
In case that doesn't work out,
why don't you come to dinner with me...

142
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,389
...and Paul tonight?

143
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,392
You can ask him if any of his friends
have any job openings.

144
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,728
But sometimes people want to, you know...

145
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:29,651
...they think they're owed a lot more
than, uh, they deserve. So too bad. Bummer.

146
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,529
Uh, but, uh, you know, whatever. Sucks.

147
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,198
I just don't have to be the guy
that tells them, uh, you know...

148
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:41,288
...that they're, uh, not going to be able
to rebuild their houses. Um, anyway....

149
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,457
Uh, let's talk about something else,
you know.

150
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,752
You're right.
I'm sick of talking about Medicaid...

151
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,547
...and processing insurance forms as well.
I get it.

152
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,923
- Right.
- I get it.

153
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,635
Right. I mean, it's slightly different
when you're doing Medicaid claims...

154
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,388
...and when you're doing huge
property damage claims...

155
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,349
- ...but I guess it's a similar kind of thing.
- Yeah.

156
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,310
Oh, wait, wait.

157
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,271
- Remember what I said?
- Hmm, I'm so sorry.

158
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,149
I just can't drive tonight.
I've been driving all weekend.

159
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,358
I'm sorry.

160
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,776
- No worries.
- I just forgot.

161
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,029
Someone will finish it, I think.

162
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,490
- There you go. There's a taker.
- I will.

163
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,578
- Tsk.
- Good?

164
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,084
Where are you going?

165
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,179
Uh, hey,
do you know who's spinning tonight?

166
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,181
Heh, uh....

167
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,558
- No. Sorry.
- All right.

168
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,857
Hey, Mike.

169
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,526
Mike.

170
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,195
Sorry, bro.

171
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,866
Hey, Mike.

172
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,869
- Hey, man.
- Yo.

173
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,954
- Heh, what's going on?
- What's going on, bro?

174
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:08,083
- Are you going in?
- Yeah, we're going.

175
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,709
Can I come with you?

176
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,003
Uh....

177
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,548
Pfft, dude, they're never gonna
let you in like that.

178
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,634
Come on. I'd do anything.

179
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,679
Heh, it's not my fault.
I'm just saying they're not gonna do it.

180
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:25,016
I would do it, but...
I don't think they're going to do it, bro.

181
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,393
All right.

182
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,228
All right?

183
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,898
Fuck. Okay, dude. Hey.

184
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,942
Um....

185
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,860
You're going to owe me.

186
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,321
- I promise, man...
- I mean, owe me.

187
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,198
No questions asked, owe me.

188
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,408
Anything.

189
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:45,745
Take your hood off. Try to look a little
more... Tuck your fucking shirt in.

190
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,081
You got to not wear tennis shoes, bro.

191
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,918
George, dude, I got one.
I'm sorry. I know, I know.

192
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,087
Thanks, bro. I owe you.

193
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,092
Sorry, man. These are the only shoes I got.

194
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,478
Hey, baby, mwah.
Can we borrow one of these?

195
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,188
Thank you. Grab one.

196
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,065
Is it free?

197
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,526
Don't worry, man, you're gonna earn
your keep.

198
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,456
So I got us a new recruit.

199
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,792
Ladies, meet the Kid. Portia, Ruby.

200
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,002
Hey.

201
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,545
Heh, hey.

202
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,881
What are we thinking? Yes, no, maybe?

203
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,509
- Oh, yeah. The cougars will eat him up.
- Yeah?

204
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,762
That's a quality endorsement, my friend.

205
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,513
What do you guys do?

206
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,725
- What?
- Come here. Come here.

207
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,561
Any time a girl tells you
her name starts with a flower...

208
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,355
...a car or a stone,
don't bother asking what she does.

209
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,982
You know what I'm saying?

210
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,736
All right, I ain't got that much time,
so I'm calling in my favor, all right?

211
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:00,945
Okay.

212
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,114
You see the girl with the tiara thing
and the sash?

213
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,451
- Yeah.
- Go talk to her.

214
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,369
What do you want me to say?

215
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,956
I don't care. Have you never talked
to a girl before? Just go talk to her.

216
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,208
Be creative.

217
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,627
She does not look like she wants
to be bothered.

218
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,963
Look at what she's wearing.
She came here tonight to be bothered.

219
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,382
Go bother her.
You want to be inside or outside?

220
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,592
Inside.

221
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,011
I'll come save you in a minute.
Get out of here.

222
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:33,561
I'm getting wasted tonight
if we could get a drink.

223
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:34,771
I know.

224
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,066
She's, like, ignoring the whole side
of this bar.

225
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,484
- Hey.
- Hey, Carla.

226
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,860
Um, oh....

227
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,613
Yo, man. Watch out, you're going to knock
my girlfriend.

228
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,533
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, what the fuck are you gonna do?

229
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,081
- Uh, hi. Do I know you?
- Hi.

230
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,290
Uh, no. I'm, uh...

231
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,335
I didn't know that I had a boyfriend,
but thank you for that.

232
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,963
Um, all the guys here
are fucking obnoxious.

233
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,548
- Thanks for that.
- Heh.

234
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,175
Who do we have to fuck
to get a fucking drink?

235
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,010
Uh, me, please?

236
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,304
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Uh, yes, I would.

237
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:12,809
We've been standing around here
for quite a while, and I'm 21.

238
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,686
- It's true.
- And I can't get drunk.

239
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,020
- You're 21?
- Yes.

240
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,857
Happy 21st. I'd buy you guys a shot if I...

241
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,817
- Don't worry about it.
- It's fine.

242
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,193
Oh, Adam.

243
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,528
- Hi.
- Hi.

244
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,363
- I'm Liz. Hi.
- Hi, Liz.

245
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,407
What do you say, baby boy?
You want one?

246
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,034
I can't find anybody to take
these. Y'all want them?

247
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,662
- Perfect. We can't drink them all ourselves.
- Whoo.

248
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:37,917
Uh, here's to, um, our children.
May they have rich fucking parents, heh.

249
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,878
Heh, absolutely.

250
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,091
- Yes. Okay.
- Whoo.

251
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,677
- What, you guys go to USF?
- Yeah.

252
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,762
- Mm-hm.
- So it's summer break, correct?

253
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,347
- That's right.
- Whoo.

254
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,224
And if I'm not mistaken,
that says "21," right?

255
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,434
I am 21, yes.

256
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,436
- Then why the fuck isn't she throwing up?
- Whoo.

257
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,645
- We can't get drinks.
- Ha, ha.

258
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:01,232
You can't get drinks? That's no excuse.
That's a bad friend you got.

259
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,610
I'm not a bad friend.

260
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,987
- You are a bad friend.
- I'm trying.

261
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,280
You are a bad friend.

262
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,574
See? You heard it from her.
I'm just saying.

263
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,784
- What are you guys planning on doing tonight?
- Ha, ha.

264
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,161
Wouldn't you like to know?

265
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,330
- Actually, I would, to be totally honest.
- Ha, ha.

266
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:19,334
If you like to get a wee bit crazy,
why don't you come down and see the show?

267
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,049
- Are you serious? Wow.
- As a fucking heart attack.

268
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,468
We have a lot of friends here.
Can they come too?

269
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,844
- How many?
- Eight or nine?

270
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,179
That's perfect, actually.

271
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,932
Hand them these. Tell them
they get in free at the door.

272
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,350
Okay. Maybe we'll come.

273
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,310
No. That's not a commitment.

274
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,897
Maybe we'll come,
if your little friend here comes too.

275
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,273
- Me?
- Oh, "little friend."

276
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,484
That's an easy if,
because he will be there.

277
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,486
- He's absolutely gonna be there.
- I will?

278
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,946
Then we'll be there too.

279
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:52,492
All right. The show starts in 45 minutes.
You can make it in 45 minutes?

280
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,036
- You're going to come. You swear?
- Yeah, we promise.

281
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,956
- Dude. You're a fucking stripper?
Ha-ha-ha.

282
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,042
I swear, I thought you were going to shit
the bed, but you, heh, actually did it.

283
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,836
Ah, I feel like I owe you.
I can throw you 100 bucks...

284
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,838
...tip you out at the end of the night...

285
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,341
- ...if you really want to host.
- Host what?

286
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,219
Yeah. No, for sure.

287
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,599
- I hope you're ready for this shit.
- Ha, ha.

288
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,275
Who's your friend, Mike?

289
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,198
- This is the owner. Jesus.
- Whoo.

290
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:35,827
Fucking Valhalla shit, man, mwah.

291
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,161
You see that shit, Mike?

292
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,580
Chicks are gonna go fucking crazy
over this, man.

293
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,917
I'm thinking of giving this routine
to Tarzan, unless you want it.

294
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,921
No. It's not my style, but, uh,
somebody should do it. It's cool.

295
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,715
- Oh, it's fucking really good, heh.
Mm-hm.

296
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,091
Ah, who's this?

297
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,636
This is the Kid. Uh, he wrangled, like,
nine sorority girls for us tonight...

298
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,556
...so I figured
he could help out around here tonight.

299
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,849
How old are you?

300
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,350
- Uh, nineteen.
- Nineteen.

301
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,854
- The fuck am I supposed to do with that?
- Oh, come on. He don't look 19.

302
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,063
I can't have him host.

303
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,399
Can't have a 19-year-old
on the fucking street.

304
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,151
Then he can do props, can't he?

305
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,195
- I can do anything.
- We're setting up our own shit as it is.

306
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:12,822
All right. Props.

307
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,407
You're on props tonight.

308
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,201
Do whatever Mikey tells you,
any of the guys tell you.

309
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,370
Clean the fucking toilets, whatever.

310
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,789
Tonight. And listen up.

311
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,125
- This is not a fucking joke.
- Heh.

312
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,920
All right? It's not a fucking hobby.
This is a serious business I'm running.

313
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:31,340
So the last thing I need is a teenage
liability fucking my future up.

314
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,134
- Don't try it. Yeah.
- Capiche?

315
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,596
One thing about Waffle House pussy
is you got to worry about the teeth.

316
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,598
Waffle House pussy?
I hate Waffle House pussy, heh.

317
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,101
Everybody, this is the Kid.
Y'all can thank me later.

318
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,853
He's going to help us out tonight.

319
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,397
This is Big Dick Richie, Ken, Tito
and Tarzan.

320
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,607
Whoa, I get it.

321
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,152
Just tell him what props you need.
I'll help him set them up later.

322
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,781
And, uh, yeah. Have fun.
Make yourself at home, Kid.

323
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,449
There you go, bro.

324
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,077
- No, thanks, man.
- No?

325
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,329
- No. I'm good.
- Suit yourself.

326
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,998
You handed it to me like the Hindenburg.

327
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,542
- How long you been on the force?
- What?

328
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,921
The police. How long you been a cop?

329
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,881
I'm not a cop, man.

330
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,467
Ha, ha, just fucking with you. Sit down.

331
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,344
Come on, man, sit down.

332
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,931
So how do you know Mike?

333
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,308
Uh, ahem.

334
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,187
We, uh, worked together on construction.

335
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,318
What kind of cash you make at that?

336
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,694
You all right, man?

337
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,491
What kind of cash you make?

338
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,576
Like 10 bucks an hour.

339
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,453
Under the table?

340
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,038
Yeah.

341
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,957
Hmm, not bad.

342
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,212
So you're here to help us out?

343
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,381
Yes, I am.

344
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,385
All right, so we got your first
little piece of business... bam.

345
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,178
That look ashy to you?

346
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,764
- What's that, man?
- That look ashy?

347
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,266
Heads up.

348
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:07,353
Just give it a little... Just a
little spray on that calf there.

349
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,855
Oh, come on.

350
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,314
Come on.

351
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,692
Dude, I don't want to spray your leg.

352
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,569
Just do it.

353
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,195
We all had to do it, man.

354
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,824
It's like the initiation.
Lord of the Flies. Come on.

355
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,409
Come on, Kid. It's all right.

356
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,036
We'll tip you out good at the end
of the night. You'll be a happy man.

357
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,956
- Uh.
- Make sure you massage it in good.

358
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,918
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

359
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,216
He fucking did it too.

360
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,345
Oh, you're all right, man.
You're all right.

361
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:49,145
Take this front-row
table right here, ladies.

362
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,023
You got your ID on you?

363
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:56,110
You got your ID? Heh. You're not drinking
a Shirley Temple tonight, are you?

364
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,613
No. We've already had a few drinks, so....

365
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,200
No Roy Rogers, no Shirley Temples.
Y'all have a great time.

366
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:06,454
We do a group act first, then we do our
solos, then we do hot seats.

367
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,332
If everything goes well
and we get these girls jacked up...

368
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,585
...then we jack up the price of the
hot seats, so don't fuck it up.

369
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,338
Dude, it's easy.
All you got to do is hand us...

370
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:18,507
...our props before we go out on-stage.

371
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,093
All right? That's it.
That's all you got to do.

372
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,930
You bring out whatever props
and everything... There he is.

373
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,975
This is Tobias. He is our resident DJ.

374
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,102
Tobias, the Kid.
He's gonna be the one...

375
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,313
...giving you the cue
before each act.

376
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,441
- Pre-game. That's what I'm talking about.
- It's the love potion.

377
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,736
- What is this? Strawberry?
- What is that?

378
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:43,449
It's a little mixture.
In, uh, Miami, we call it Hey Juice.

379
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:47,536
Hey Juice. Because if you drink the whole
bottle, "Hey." You'll like it, man.

380
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,456
Give it a sample.

381
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,626
You can't drink, so you want half a cap?

382
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,837
I don't know what the fuck it is.

383
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:01,634
It's just G. It's basically like
getting drunk without all the calories.

384
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,054
- All right.
- You sure?

385
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,643
All right, all right, all right.

386
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,355
Whoo!

387
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,692
Yeah.

388
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:21,654
How are we feeling tonight, ladies?
Let me hear it one more time. Come on.

389
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:26,283
It's gonna rain. Rain gonna come down
and cleanse our soul and wash away the ash.

390
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,745
So get out your purses and get ready
to spend some motherfucking cash.

391
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,998
Welcome to the stage,
the one, the only...

392
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:35,084
...the Cock-rocking Kings of Tampa.

393
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:08,130
Ooh, aah. Ooh, aah.

394
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,716
Ooh, aah.

395
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,054
Tarzan.

396
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,396
Tarzan?

397
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,774
Where the fuck is he?

398
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:31,737
Motherfucker. What the fuck, man? Tarzan.

399
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,113
Fuck, man.

400
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:36,075
Motherfucker.
How many fucking times, huh?

401
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:41,121
Ken, S&M routine. You up on that?
Can you do that?

402
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,457
I'm not putting that out there.
Negative energy.

403
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,875
Not putting what out there?

404
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,086
The negative energy. It's bad.
It comes back.

405
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,420
You're kidding me.

406
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:51,715
Richie, the, uh, fire-breathing gig, huh?
You up for that?

407
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,510
No. I got the fire-phobia issue.

408
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,348
Tito. Anything, man.
South of the border fucking shit...

409
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,849
...you've been doing at home.

410
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:04,019
I'm working on something,
but it's not ready yet. It's not ready.

411
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,604
All right.

412
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,815
We got to do something.
Mikey, what you got?

413
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,818
- I just came off-stage. I can't.
- An idea. Give me something.

414
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:14,822
- You go out then.
- I'm not hitting the fucking floor. Come on.

415
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,700
- You want me to come up with something?
- Fuck, yeah.

416
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,248
I hope you can dance.
You still owe me. Come on.

417
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,382
Just start taking
your clothes off. Walk out there.

418
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,801
What are you looking at Dallas for?
Don't. Look at them.

419
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,971
Just start, bro.

420
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,306
Yeah, perfect, perfect. Go, go, go.

421
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:49,565
There you go.

422
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,512
Whoo!

423
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:59,134
All right, all right, all right.

424
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:03,013
Let's give it up for the Kid.
Popped his cherry on-stage tonight.

425
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,641
You know what time it is.
It's time for the hot seat.

426
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,768
You know what that means,
the orgy's over, ladies.

427
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,978
Time for some one-on-one time
with the man of your dreams.

428
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,732
- Five dollars a pop.
- Come here.

429
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,527
That's good.
Welcome to the crazy club, Kid.

430
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:20,114
Come on. Everybody.
Line up, line up, line up.

431
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,200
Yeah, man. Whose big dick is that?

432
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,368
Whoo.

433
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,873
- I love it.
- Hey, where's the Kid? Kid. Kid.

434
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,793
Look at this saggy underwearing,
all-star right here.

435
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,461
Go buy yourself fresh drawers.

436
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:37,172
He put that kiss on her and
pouring money out of their hands.

437
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,884
Aaah!

438
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,888
Never kiss the girls, Kid.
That's Performer 101.

439
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,682
You gotta watch out for herpes.

440
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,891
That too.

441
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,728
But tonight you took a chance
and it paid off. I like that.

442
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,438
Fucking worked.

443
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,648
I got you your money.

444
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,984
That ain't my money, big boy.
That's your money.

445
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,528
Every man keeps every dollar
he makes on that stage.

446
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:03,115
Plus the 50 that I owe you. All right?

447
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,952
Look, get ready to work, big boy.
It ain't gonna be that easy every time.

448
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,955
- Yes, sir.
- Fucking worked, whoo!

449
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,999
Ho!

450
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,085
Ken, nice fucking robot.

451
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:19,715
Mike lays it out. Tito bringing in
the south side with some brown skin.

452
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,676
Big Dick, they are still devastated
by your cock.

453
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,637
It was loke 25 percent dancong,
50 percent marketing.

454
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,682
- What...?
- Eh, Mike sold it up real nice.

455
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,352
How about you're forgetting 25 percent
more genius?

456
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,022
- Genius, Kid.
- How we do tonight, Mikey?

457
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:40,319
Uh, it's a little under $2500.
Uh, that's 400 better than last week.

458
00:29:40,486 --> 00:29:41,653
That'll work.

459
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:45,157
- And my, uh, cut of the door.
- Yes, sir.

460
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,367
That was dangerous shit
you pulled tonight...

461
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,494
...throwing that kid out
on the plank like that.

462
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,789
It worked though, didn't it?

463
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,000
Shit. I didn't know if it was,
till he hit the floor.

464
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,879
- He pulled it out.
- Yeah. What's his story?

465
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,673
I don't know. I mean, I met him
at the site today.

466
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:05,928
Ran into him at Ybor.
Those two little pretty ones over there...

467
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:10,265
...were all hot and bothered,
so I figured I'd bring him along.

468
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,768
It was a good move, heh.

469
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:16,021
He may have something, brother.
He's young, good-looking....

470
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,483
- He can't dance for shit.
- Cannot dance for shit, that is teachable.

471
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,402
We could use some more youth
on the team.

472
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,989
Why don't you bring him to practice
tomorrow and we'll see what he's got?

473
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,533
So, what the fuck is going on with Miami?

474
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,411
Miami, ah, is looking good.

475
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,830
I got a couple loopholes
I got to get through...

476
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,582
...with the, uh, real-estate attorneys.

477
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,918
But after that it's gonna
be all green lights.

478
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,546
- What you need from me? What's my side?
- Just keep doing what you're doing.

479
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,840
I love where your head's at.
You're focused.

480
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,260
You're like a big brother
to this team.

481
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:49,263
Keep that up, you could be making
a lot more than door money.

482
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,764
I guarantee you that.

483
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,641
Both ways this time, though, right?

484
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,477
- Two-way street.
- I want to hear you say the word: Equity.

485
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:56,853
E-Q-...
- Say it.

486
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,564
...-U-I-T-Y.
- Say it.

487
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,642
Oh.

488
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,185
- Hey, Mike.
- Huh?

489
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,187
I think, uh....

490
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,524
I think we should be best friends.

491
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,651
Okay, heh.

492
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,404
Let's go, heh.

493
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:20,080
So how pregnant
did you get that girl's mouth?

494
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,581
Uh, wet? Heh.

495
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,215
Fucking great.

496
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,887
Good morning.

497
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,556
- Hi, sis.
- Hi.

498
00:33:37,723 --> 00:33:41,518
- Brooke, this is Mike, uh....
- Oh, thank you. Mike, this is Brooke.

499
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,020
- Brooke. Absolute pleasure. Hi.
- Mike.

500
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,856
Are you a nurse?

501
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:49,484
I'm a medical assistant.
I process nurses' paperwork.

502
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,694
Way cooler.

503
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,904
Sure. Sure.

504
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,870
Oh, nice, dude. Is this one of those retro
Wakefield, or is this a Russel Wright?

505
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,249
Oh, it's a knock-off. That's cool, though.
Where did you get this?

506
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,835
Uh, apparently the knock-off place.

507
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,420
Heh, right.

508
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:12,215
- So how do you know my brother?
- Uh, he's on my roofing crew.

509
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:16,636
But I'm, uh, an entrepreneur, though.
I, uh, manage a few businesses.

510
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,597
Sure.

511
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:21,558
Sure, cool. Cool.

512
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,689
So the Kid said something
about breakfast.

513
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:32,068
Uh, well, he must be fucking drunk
because I don't cook no fucking breakfast.

514
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:38,116
I wasn't talking about you cooking it.
He just said you like breakfast food.

515
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,786
We were going to swing by IHOP
on the way...

516
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,498
Okay uh, good talk.

517
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:48,919
Um, I'll be outside with the rest
of the breakfast lovers of the world.

518
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,340
All right, Kid.

519
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,217
Virgin dance the other night. No more.

520
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,260
You only have a cherry pop one time.

521
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:01,348
Now look, you walked out on-stage,
you looked like shit, all right?

522
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,683
When I saw something
is when you got off-stage.

523
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,519
Pulled a one-on-one with that chick.

524
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,772
I'll show you what you're gonna do.
Now, let's go to the basics.

525
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,981
Take your clothes off.

526
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,858
- Right now?
- Right now. Take them off.

527
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,027
Every fucking one of them. Let's go.

528
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,780
Let's go. Take them off.

529
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,866
- Heh.
- Hang on. What the fuck are you doing?

530
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,202
Heh, what are you, a 12-year-old
in the locker room?

531
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,411
No.

532
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,830
- Then what are you doing?
- Heh, taking off my clothes.

533
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:28,291
You're taking off your clothes
like a 12-year-old.

534
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,545
But you're not a 12-year-old
in the locker room. You are the man.

535
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,589
On the stage. Thousands of women.

536
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:37,801
Eyes on you. You are their vision.
So, what do you do?

537
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:42,347
You don't just fucking throw your clothes off.
You fucking make it count, baby.

538
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,350
You walk out. You own it.

539
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,853
You look around. You tease.

540
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,022
You seduce.

541
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,193
Clock eyes,
but don't lock in on any of them.

542
00:35:55,861 --> 00:36:00,532
You got to believe that you are inside
every single one of them.

543
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,494
And when the time's right,
then you'll know it.

544
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,663
Foom!

545
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:12,335
Stick it. That right there is like
hitting the G-spot, every single time.

546
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,212
Now get up there, move around.

547
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,840
You see, baby, you're not just stripping.

548
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:21,219
You are fulfilling every woman's
wildest fantasies. All right?

549
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,097
You are the husband that they never had.

550
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:27,142
You are that dreamboat guy
that never came along.

551
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,687
You are the one-night stand,
that free fling of a fuck...

552
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:34,733
...they get to have, tonight, with you
on-stage, still go home to their hubby...

553
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,234
...and not get in trouble...

554
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:40,155
...because you, baby, you made it legal.
You are the liberation.

555
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,824
Own it. Who's got the cock?
You do, they don't.

556
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,784
Get right here. Move slow. Around.

557
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,453
Fucking concentrate.

558
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,497
Round, round, round.
Make this shit count.

559
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:53,043
Ain't time for a fucking fag joke
in here, boy. I'm talking about money.

560
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:56,254
Move around, round, round.
Get the movements. Breathe.

561
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:59,257
All right. Easy, rattlesnake.

562
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,217
On three, you're going to stick it.

563
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:05,055
One, two, three, stick.

564
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,515
That's the hook, baby.
That's the fucking hook.

565
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:10,352
That's what I'm talking about.
All right?

566
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,690
You can do this, because I know you can.

567
00:37:15,941 --> 00:37:17,651
- I can do it.
- Now, take a breath.

568
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,780
Fuck that mirror like you mean it.

569
00:37:21,947 --> 00:37:25,116
"All right, all right, all right.

570
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,203
Heh, we got the Kid coming up
on the main stage." Hi, Beatrice.

571
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:33,083
Are you ready? Dallas gave me the go-ahead
on getting you suited up. You ready?

572
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,501
Yeah.

573
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,086
Why do you look scared for?

574
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:40,048
You already lost your virginity.
All you got to do now is get good at it.

575
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:43,259
We got to get you an American flag
Star-Spangled Banner...

576
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,970
...for Fourth of July summertime.

577
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,973
Dude. This has no back.

578
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,852
Yeah. That's the point. It's a thong.

579
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,731
What the fuck is this?

580
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,360
Stay away from the elephant socks, bro.
That's Dallas shit.

581
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,654
You don't want to look like him, do you?

582
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,824
What's Dallas's deal, man?
Is he, uh, a good guy?

583
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,828
Yeah. Dallas is.... Dallas is Dallas.

584
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,415
I mean, it's pretty cool that he let me in.

585
00:38:13,999 --> 00:38:16,835
Yeah. It's cool that he let you in.

586
00:38:17,002 --> 00:38:18,837
Look, we think you got something.

587
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,797
I'm not exactly sure
what that is just yet...

588
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:25,927
...but, uh, all we know is you got a lot of work to do.
So don't quit your day job yet.

589
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,919
Adam.

590
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,673
- Get out here. I need to talk to you.
- What do you want?

591
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,426
I want to talk to you, man.
Get the fuck out.

592
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,930
- Get out, Adam.
- I'll be out in a minute, please. One sec.

593
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,767
Adam, I need to fucking talk to you.

594
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,310
What about?

595
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:19,939
Um, About this box.
I need to talk to you about this box...

596
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,066
Oh, fuck me.

597
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:26,488
...of boots and thongs and sailor hats
and tube socks. And I am fucking...

598
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,448
It's for work.

599
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,451
For work? Adam, don't
fucking lie to me, man.

600
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,537
I'm your sister. I love you.
I don't judge you.

601
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:38,124
You're my brother. Just please come out
here so I can talk to you.

602
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,418
I don't care what your preferences are.

603
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,837
- Preferences?
- I just want to talk to you about...

604
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,464
Whoa, hey.

605
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,633
It is not what it looks like.

606
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,302
Is that my razor?

607
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:50,970
Yeah.

608
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,808
Are you shaving your fucking legs?

609
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,227
Yeah, I'm shaving my legs.

610
00:39:57,394 --> 00:39:58,978
Why are you shaving your legs?

611
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,438
It's for work. Okay?

612
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,942
What do you mean, it's for work?
How could it possibly be for work?

613
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,174
Ma'am, excuse me.
You're going to have to move it down.

614
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:13,303
This is the breakfast lovers' section.
Here we go.

615
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,721
Hi, Mike.

616
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,931
- Hi.
- Hi.

617
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,101
Entrepreneur/stripper?
Stripper/entrepreneur?

618
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,689
Either one. It's fine.

619
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,609
You really just came down
to see little brother?

620
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:30,069
No, I was hoping this was all a joke.

621
00:41:31,488 --> 00:41:33,364
It is pretty funny.

622
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,413
You better take care of him, Mike.

623
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,752
Okay, Mom.

624
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,672
I'll take care of him.
You should stick around, though.

625
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:07,273
All right, all right.
Let's give it up for the Kid, huh?

626
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:11,986
Bang. A six-shooter for you. There we go.

627
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:16,783
This next performer who's coming out...

628
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,911
...he's one of a kind, ladies.

629
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,832
I saw this young man walking down
the street about six years ago...

630
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,378
...and I knew when I saw him,
I just knew I had to bring him in.

631
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:33,591
Bring him in and have his talents
be shown to the universe.

632
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:37,011
And tonight, he's going to be right here
on this stage...

633
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,305
...so you can see with your very own eyes.

634
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,809
Our feature presentation,
the one and only...

635
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:47,522
...the star of the show, Mr. Magic Mike.

636
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,290
Did you see your sister tonight?

637
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,626
- See my sister? What do you mean?
- Yeah.

638
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,378
Your sister was there.

639
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,630
No, she wasn't.

640
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,466
Yeah, she was there during your act.

641
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,093
You talked to my sister?

642
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:25,596
I talked to your sister as you were
dry-humping a girl, yes.

643
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,723
My sister saw me dance?

644
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,643
Heh, yeah, we were actually laughing.
I had a pretty good laugh about it.

645
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:34,063
- Oh, heh, wow. Fuck.
- Ha, ha.

646
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,524
She did not look happy.
Did you tell her to come?

647
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,235
I told her. I didn't think
she'd fucking come. Jeez.

648
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:44,240
Well, she did. I don't know how long
she stayed for, but it was, uh....

649
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:49,495
- She, ha, ha, looked pissed.
- Ha, ha, oof.

650
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:51,497
How much money did you make tonight?

651
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:53,499
- How much money?
- Yeah.

652
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:55,835
Like 230.

653
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,336
Two-thirty? That's good, man.

654
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:01,465
Oh, by the way, I got this for you.
Uh, just for gas and shit.

655
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,092
- Get the...
- Ha, ha.

656
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,428
Are you kidding me?
Keep your money. It's fine.

657
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,889
- You drive me around.
- I can pay for my own gas.

658
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:11,893
It's fine. Thank you, though. It was a
really sweet gesture. I appreciate it.

659
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,185
Thank you.

660
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,791
That's a beautiful necklace.

661
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,710
- Is that vintage?
- Oh, I, um....

662
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,379
No, it's.... No, it's, heh....

663
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:44,258
My sister got it for me, ha, ha
from Target, I think.

664
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:48,638
Um, tsk, SBA, yes, uh....

665
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:50,097
Name and Social.

666
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:52,516
Absolutely. Michael Lane.

667
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:58,064
038-00-7128. And I, uh...

668
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:01,275
...brought the funds
for my down payment.

669
00:47:05,238 --> 00:47:08,616
- Yes. Yeah, heh.
- Heh.

670
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,701
Okay.

671
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,084
All right.

672
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:24,465
We seem to have a credit issue, Mr. Lane.
Your score is...

673
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,384
Right. I, uh, actually...

674
00:47:26,551 --> 00:47:28,844
- ...heh, I talked to Mr. Rodriguez last week.
- Oh.

675
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:33,766
As I was explaining to him, the businesses
that I manage deal exclusively in cash.

676
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:37,812
He said you would forego the credit check
if I brought in a healthy down payment.

677
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,940
It should be noted in there.
He said he was going to put it in.

678
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,692
Absolutely.

679
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:51,283
Um, you are currently the manager
of an automotive accessories business?

680
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:56,706
Mm-hm, absolutely. And an event-management
company, a roofing firm, heh.

681
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:59,250
Honestly, the list goes on.

682
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:02,712
- Wow, you're a busy guy.
- Ha, ha. Yeah.

683
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:04,505
Lucky to be.

684
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:07,883
So, what kind of rates am I looking at?

685
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:18,811
There are ways to clear these credit issues
up over time, but...

686
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:23,399
Oh, my God, I haven't even told you, heh,
what I'm here for. I really apologize.

687
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,901
This is what I do.

688
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,821
Right here.
Michael Lane Custom Furniture Concepts.

689
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:31,782
It's competitive pricing. Low overhead.

690
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:36,120
I mean, really, who wants to buy
that crap when it falls apart in a year...

691
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:40,332
...when you can get hand-crafted furniture
for a bargain?

692
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:45,421
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

693
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:55,806
Unfortunately, Mr. Lane,
my hands are tied.

694
00:48:57,017 --> 00:49:00,728
The company has a policy
that we cannot issue loans...

695
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:03,439
...to clients who score below
our credit threshold.

696
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:07,151
I can absolutely understand
where you're coming from.

697
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,821
Uh, you know, you hit buttons and you think
that you know something about me.

698
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,823
I get it. That's okay. It's okay.

699
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:16,619
All, uh, I'm asking for is a good deal.

700
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:19,914
Please, can you help me with that?

701
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:25,086
I mean, we do offer relief programs...

702
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:28,839
...for our qualified distressed clients,
so that...

703
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,800
I'm sorry. What?

704
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,676
It's a relief program, so...

705
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:35,262
Distressed? I'm distressed?

706
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,264
- No. No, not like that.
- Heh.

707
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:40,976
Sweetheart, listen. It's okay. It's fine.
Does this look distressed?

708
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:45,022
I don't think so, one.
Two, I read the papers, okay?

709
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,608
The only thing's that distressed is y'all.

710
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,580
You can't get the door?

711
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,841
Happy birthday

712
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,510
Mrs. Pres...

713
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:18,597
Oh.

714
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:20,307
Adam, it's for you.

715
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,518
Happy, heh, Birthday, heh, pfft.

716
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,521
Ha, ha. Come on. Let's go. Sandbar party.

717
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:29,275
Fourth of July, nuts-on-your-head
wake-up call, let's go. Come on.

718
00:50:29,442 --> 00:50:31,861
No, no, no. You are coming too.
Don't even try.

719
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,781
I'm going to go to bed.
It's 7 in the morning.

720
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,950
"Oh, it's 7 in the morning.
I hate fun."

721
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,119
Jesus Christ, you better have
some epic plans...

722
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:42,705
...if you're gonna turn your back
on a sandbar party.

723
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:36,508
What did I tell you?

724
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:39,178
- Paradise.
- Heh.

725
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:44,308
Yeah. Paradise. Marooned on an island
with all the strippers in Tampa.

726
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:47,895
How did I get so lucky?
The best Fourth of July ever, heh.

727
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:49,939
I literally was just thinking...

728
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:52,858
- ...that in my head, like just now.
- Ha, ha.

729
00:51:53,526 --> 00:51:55,194
Get out of my head.

730
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,573
- Oh, shit. Yo.
- Hey.

731
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:03,285
- What are you doing here?
- You know me. Always making new friends.

732
00:52:03,536 --> 00:52:05,454
- Good to see you.
- You too. How are you?

733
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,748
I'm good. Uh, this is, um, Brooke.

734
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:08,958
- Hi.
- Oh, hey.

735
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,167
Brooke, uh, Joanna.

736
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:12,503
- Nice to meet you.
- You too. I like your bikini.

737
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,754
Thank you. You too.

738
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,214
- Is that a tattoo?
- Yeah.

739
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,840
What does it say?

740
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:20,844
- Oh, uh, it just says I was 17, and....
- Ha, ha.

741
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:22,221
Yeah.

742
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,430
It's crazy.

743
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:27,351
Yeah. Uh, so I know, uh, Joanna from the club.
Uh, she came up...

744
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,770
She studied psychology
and she came up to do, uh....

745
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:32,273
What's the thing you
came up to do?

746
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,732
Behavior analysis.

747
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,443
Right. She was analysizing our behavior,
apparently.

748
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:38,821
That must have been, uh,
really enlightening.

749
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:42,741
It actually was. You know, I go a few times
a week, if you want to come with us.

750
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,868
She is actually the Kid's brother.

751
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,412
I mean, sister.

752
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:48,455
- Yeah, heh. Ha, ha.
- Right. Ahem.

753
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,457
- Is that a tattoo over there too?
- Yeah.

754
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:52,459
She has tattoos. You want a drink?

755
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:53,711
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?

756
00:52:53,878 --> 00:52:56,422
- It was nice to meet you.
- It was nice to meet you too.

757
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:02,094
She's cute. What? I don't normally like
blonds, but she's really cute.

758
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:05,180
Yeah, but she's not really our type.
You know what I'm saying?

759
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,473
You're not into her?

760
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:09,893
No, that's not what I'm saying.
I'm saying she's a little uptight.

761
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:12,104
We're fucking her,
not taking her to dinner.

762
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,314
It's not gonna happen.

763
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:16,317
- She's a dinner type, is what I'm trying to say.
- Oh.

764
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:19,695
Okay, if you decide you want to share...

765
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:24,033
...and change your mind and put some
effort into it, you know my number.

766
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,201
Besides, you know how much I love to eat.

767
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:30,497
Yes, I will.
Obviously you don't like head.

768
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:45,137
I started cheating in the seventh grade
just to entertain myself.

769
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:48,057
Finished high school, but if I could do it
all over again...

770
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:50,267
...I wouldn't have even gone. No way.

771
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,311
You don't believe in school at all?

772
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,104
I think fuck school altogether.

773
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:57,107
When I have a kid,
I'm going to set him in front of the TV...

774
00:53:57,275 --> 00:54:00,944
...and make him watch Mad Money all day.
Teach him about the stock market.

775
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,697
Get him into Ameritrade
and shit like that.

776
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:07,826
I guarantee you by the time he's 18, that
little fucker's gonna be flush in cash.

777
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:09,328
Boo-yah!
- Heh.

778
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:12,206
- I don't know why more people
don't do that... DALLAS: Hm?

779
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,208
...just from an investment standpoint.

780
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:16,377
That's the state of the country, man.

781
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:20,214
America. People. Stupid.

782
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:21,965
I hope I get to meet your kids someday.

783
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:23,425
Tsk, Oh, no problem.

784
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:26,261
Come visit anytime
in one of our three cool houses, dear.

785
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,894
Hey, if you want, I could probably
get Dallas' number for you.

786
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,896
He's starting
this new life-coaching business...

787
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:39,817
...that I really do think you might benefit
from personally.

788
00:54:39,984 --> 00:54:42,528
I mean, I saw the connection
between the two of you.

789
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:44,863
What? I'm sorry.

790
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:48,617
Right? So you felt it too?
What? Just, what?

791
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,494
What would his kids even look like?

792
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:53,872
They'd be running around
in little rattlesnake diapers and shit.

793
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,541
Oh, no. Oh, no.

794
00:54:55,708 --> 00:54:59,044
Look, don't, uh, they just say stupid shit
sometimes. Don't let them bother you.

795
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:00,587
Oh, no, it didn't bother me.

796
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:04,675
I'm just trying to wrap my mind
around Adam and this whole mess.

797
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,803
I get it. I don't know how
I fit into this whole mix, either.

798
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:11,098
No. You... When you're on-stage,
it all makes sense.

799
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:14,309
I mean, the way you dance
and the way the women respond to you....

800
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:18,897
Wait a minute. So that means
someone might have stuck around.

801
00:55:19,732 --> 00:55:21,650
That's good to know.

802
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:23,527
Yeah.

803
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:28,574
That feeling.... That must be a really
crazy feeling to be on-stage...

804
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:31,994
...like that. I see why you've been
doing it for so long. I get it.

805
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,746
- But Adam's different. He's....
- Why is that?

806
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:37,082
Well, he had a football scholarship.

807
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:41,420
A year ago, he basically ruined it
by getting...

808
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:45,507
...in a fistfight with his coach
in the first hour of the first day.

809
00:55:45,758 --> 00:55:48,844
- Yeah. I think he said something about that.
- Yeah.

810
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:52,347
So I just don't...
I'm just trying to figure out...

811
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,683
...why he's stripping.

812
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,603
- "Why" is easy.
- What do you mean, it's easy?

813
00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:59,688
- You want some stripper wisdom?
- Okay.

814
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,356
- You ready?
- Yeah.

815
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,442
He's 19 years old.

816
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:08,614
It's women, money and a good time.

817
00:56:10,783 --> 00:56:12,784
I guess. I guess.

818
00:56:13,786 --> 00:56:14,870
I got him.

819
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:17,623
Okay?

820
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:19,833
Okay.

821
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,461
- You gonna come to the show tonight?
- No.

822
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,712
- You're gonna come.
- No.

823
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,049
- You just said you liked the show.
- Doesn't mean I'm gonna go again.

824
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,676
- But you said...
- I'm not, heh, going. I've seen it.

825
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:33,972
- Does that mean you were lying?
- I'm not lying.

826
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,331
I do know and I've been told

827
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,333
I do know and I've been told

828
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,377
Big Dick Richie got a cock of gold

829
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:04,962
Big Dick Richie got a cock of gold

830
00:57:05,129 --> 00:57:07,005
Now, let's give it up for the Virgin Kid

831
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,882
Let's give it up for the Virgin Kid

832
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,759
Anything you want, he won't forbid

833
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,553
Anything you want, he won't forbid

834
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,888
Now, Mikey got a pipe you gonna love

835
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:16,682
Mikey's got a cock you know you gonna love

836
00:57:16,849 --> 00:57:18,600
What he got down low fits like a glove

837
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,227
What he got down low fits like a glove

838
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,603
Soldiers, sound off

839
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:22,813
One, two

840
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,523
- Sound off
Three, four

841
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:29,278
One, two, three, four, one, two...
three, four

842
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:38,203
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

843
00:58:29,505 --> 00:58:32,424
Oh, don't do that. Don't do that.

844
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:36,011
I didn't... He did that himself.

845
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,804
I'm bringing him home.

846
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,097
Hey, brother bear.

847
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,185
- Thank you.
- He's just stoned out of his mind.

848
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:47,064
Heh, yeah, um, um....

849
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:49,483
Hi.

850
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:52,361
What's up, dude?
Yeah, we, we... My bad. We, uh....

851
00:58:52,528 --> 00:58:53,862
- Yeah.
- All right. I'll see you later.

852
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,322
What's up, dude?

853
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,782
Is that Paul?

854
00:58:56,949 --> 00:58:59,660
- Yeah. It's... Yeah.
- It is?

855
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:05,749
- It's going good?
- Yeah, it's good. Just, heh, go on.

856
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:09,711
Hey, I... uh, thanks.
Thanks for bringing him back.

857
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,964
I told you I was going to take care of him,
didn't I?

858
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:15,300
- Watch yourself.
- All right, heh.

859
01:00:09,021 --> 01:00:12,858
So, uh, I don't know,
how's school or whatever?

860
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:19,865
Um.... It's good. It's good.

861
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,662
I'm sorry,
what the fuck do you study again?

862
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:28,039
Social studies, or sociology or....

863
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:30,000
Heh, did you say "social studies"?

864
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:31,585
Social science, heh?

865
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:34,212
What, am I in middle school
or something, heh?

866
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,006
No. No.

867
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:38,842
- No?
- Psychology.

868
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:44,389
So how much longer you got
in, uh, psychology?

869
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:49,728
Uh, I have, uh, six weeks until I'm....

870
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,313
- For real? Six weeks?
- Yeah.

871
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,149
And then I'm a certified shrink.
Six weeks. That's right.

872
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:58,653
- Wow.
- I know. People have to pay me now, heh.

873
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:01,072
- That's huge.
- It is, yeah.

874
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:04,326
I'm not paying you.
Not for these little visits, at least.

875
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:06,912
I'd feel bad taking money from you.

876
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:09,581
Heh, I'm too fucked up anyway, so....

877
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,833
Oh, you're not so bad.

878
01:01:18,382 --> 01:01:19,800
So are you going to open up...?

879
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:24,554
You ask a lot of questions, don't you?
Little Chatty Cathy tonight, huh?

880
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:27,599
- Chatty Cathy.
- Chatty Cathy.

881
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:30,602
And questions are off-limits, I guess?

882
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,687
- They're always off-limits.
- Really?

883
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,773
You don't need to talk. Just look pretty.

884
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:38,193
What was your name?
I can't remember. What was it?

885
01:01:41,113 --> 01:01:44,950
Look, I'm going to go, okay?
Um, but I'll give you a call?

886
01:01:45,117 --> 01:01:46,660
Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

887
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:48,662
Mm-hm.
- Okay.

888
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,080
- Mm-hm.
Mm-hm, muah.

889
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:51,498
Get out of here.

890
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:44,235
That's what I'm saying. I'm....

891
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:47,530
I'm looking at longevity. This is fun
for now, I'm not gonna be...

892
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:51,284
...this young and beautiful forever.
Strip malls, I think I got a good idea.

893
01:03:51,535 --> 01:03:55,205
You know, and I watch all these people,
Carleton Sheets and these guys on TV.

894
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:57,540
And I read this book called
Rich Dad, Poor Dad.

895
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:59,376
- That's a great book.
- You read that?

896
01:03:59,543 --> 01:04:01,628
- I went to the convention.
- Yeah, uh, Robert Kiyosaki.

897
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:03,380
- Kiyosaki.
- Yeah, that's the guy.

898
01:04:03,547 --> 01:04:04,798
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

899
01:04:05,257 --> 01:04:06,383
Heeey-ah!

900
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:08,677
All right, all right, all right, hey, ah.

901
01:04:08,844 --> 01:04:11,429
If everybody can quiet down a second here.

902
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,556
Quiet down a sec?

903
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:16,559
Hey, everybody. Shut the fuck up.

904
01:04:17,269 --> 01:04:19,354
Richie, that's fucking microsuede, man.

905
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:22,607
- Aw, shit. Sorry, bro.
- It's all right. Thanks.

906
01:04:23,275 --> 01:04:26,194
All right, now I got an announcement
to make.

907
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,905
Now, that means you too, Tarzan.
Come on, big boy...

908
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:31,825
...out of the shadows, into the light.
Come on, baby.

909
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:37,455
I've been telling y'all this is going to be
a special night for a long time.

910
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:39,666
Now I'm going to tell you why.

911
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:43,294
Despite the hurricane
that has soiled our rather bountiful...

912
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:44,838
...Saturday afternoon...

913
01:04:45,005 --> 01:04:47,757
...the good Lord has blessed
the Kings of Tampa this summer.

914
01:04:47,925 --> 01:04:49,300
Can I get an "amen" on that?

915
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:51,553
- Yes.
- Amen.

916
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:53,555
Mm.

917
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,350
We've been talking a lot about the markets.

918
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:59,436
Waiting for the sweet spot.

919
01:04:59,603 --> 01:05:03,440
Waiting for our time to make our move,
take our show global.

920
01:05:04,316 --> 01:05:06,776
Well, as of September 1 st...

921
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:11,322
...we will no longer be
the Cock-rocking Kings of Tampa.

922
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:12,991
No, sir, no, ma'am.

923
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:17,036
We will be the Cock-rocking Kings...

924
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:19,289
...of 4000 square feet...

925
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:23,918
...of Miami prime-time beachfront
real estate, motherfuckers.

926
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:34,137
Ah, Big Dick, keep it fucking hanging low.

927
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:37,223
- Tito, call them Cubano cousins, huh?
- They on their way, baby.

928
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:40,435
Kid, you ready for the big time, huh?
You ready for the big time?

929
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,854
Tobias, you ready to take yourself
to the beach?

930
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:44,522
I'm ready, man. I'm ready, huh.

931
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:47,317
Ken, the housewives
are gonna love you down there.

932
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,360
- We are blessed.
- They're gonna love you.

933
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:52,822
Huh, Tarzan. Did you know they made trees
tall enough to swing from Tampa...

934
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:55,658
...to motherfucking Miami, huh? Unh!

935
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:58,411
Yeah. My main man.

936
01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:01,539
The moon is just a chip shot away,
brother, heh.

937
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:03,792
A chip shot away. Fuck, yeah.

938
01:06:03,959 --> 01:06:06,544
I got to let it sink in, man.
We're really doing this?

939
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:09,547
Oh, fuck, yeah, we're doing this, man.
This is our time.

940
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:11,633
All right. All right.

941
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:15,136
Listen, man. I couldn't even have dreamed
all this shit up without you.

942
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:18,598
We're gonna do it together,
we're gonna do it just like we always said.

943
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:22,477
- Seven-point-five across the board...
- You meant to say 10, didn't you?

944
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:25,855
Congrats, Kid.

945
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:27,899
Thanks, man.

946
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:31,611
Heh, you know, if you ever want to go
in on a pack with me....

947
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:34,906
Mike's not interested,
but we can go halfsies.

948
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:36,950
I could make it worth your while.

949
01:06:37,117 --> 01:06:38,868
Yeah, sure.

950
01:06:41,622 --> 01:06:43,623
- I'll talk to you later about it, okay?
- Yeah.

951
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:58,096
Who is that?

952
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:00,431
Nora.

953
01:07:01,433 --> 01:07:03,768
I don't think you need
that in your life, bro.

954
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:35,633
Heh, hey, baby girl, what are you doing?

955
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:37,468
Huh?

956
01:07:37,636 --> 01:07:40,138
No, I'm at, uh... I don't
know, I'm at this party.

957
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,390
It's getting lame.
I want to get out of here.

958
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:46,561
How about I, uh, come scoop you up?
I can bring you a present.

959
01:07:47,479 --> 01:07:48,646
What?

960
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,690
- What thing?
- Boom!

961
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:52,567
I got a thing.

962
01:07:53,986 --> 01:07:55,862
Come on, you ain't...

963
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:58,197
All right.

964
01:07:58,365 --> 01:08:01,242
Okay. All right, I'll call you later.

965
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:14,505
This is Herman.

966
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:17,175
Hi, Herman.

967
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:20,261
He likes you.

968
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:34,192
Hey, y'all. It's all right.

969
01:08:34,693 --> 01:08:35,860
Hey, man.

970
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:38,529
We'd like to order.

971
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:40,949
All right.

972
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:45,411
- That pig is so fucking cute.
- Heh.

973
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:49,207
Angels or demons?

974
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:52,210
- Angels.
- Angels. Okay.

975
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,049
- If you chew it, it'll hit you quicker.
- Heh.

976
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:02,053
- You're gonna fucking love this one.
- Yeah.

977
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:07,058
Yeah, fucking Miami, man.
Heh, fucking Miami.

978
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,233
How you kids doing tonight?

979
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:17,735
That storm is crazy, huh?

980
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:24,534
- Beautiful.
- Mmm....

981
01:09:29,581 --> 01:09:31,749
My wife's tits are awesome, right?

982
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:33,167
What?

983
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:36,045
I said my wife's tits are awesome.

984
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:38,464
Yeah.

985
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:42,593
Check them out, man.

986
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:46,806
- You fucking joking?
- I'm not fucking joking. Check them out.

987
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:49,600
Feel them. They're so
fucking, heh, amazing.

988
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:53,688
Come on.

989
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:58,526
It's okay. Go ahead, man.

990
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:00,903
- They're real, I swear.
- Yeah, I bet they are.

991
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:04,615
See?

992
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:08,286
- Heh.
- This is okay?

993
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:12,165
It's okay with me, man. She loves it.

994
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:15,209
I fucking love you.

995
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:16,419
No, man, I love you.

996
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:18,337
- You don't understand.
- I love you.

997
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:20,256
No, I fucking....

998
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:21,758
I fucking love you, man.

999
01:10:21,925 --> 01:10:25,011
I love you, man.
You're such a fucking special soul.

1000
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:26,637
I love you.

1001
01:10:26,805 --> 01:10:28,890
I love you too.

1002
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:44,989
Is she even home?

1003
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:49,494
Brooke!

1004
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:55,500
Hi.

1005
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:58,086
What do you think?

1006
01:10:58,587 --> 01:10:59,921
Is it yours?

1007
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:02,340
Is it mine? Fuck, yeah, it's mine.

1008
01:11:03,675 --> 01:11:05,009
It's very you.

1009
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:07,428
Come on. Let's go.
We're going to celebrate.

1010
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:08,721
Come on.

1011
01:11:08,889 --> 01:11:10,431
- Come on.
- Come on.

1012
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:14,811
Come on. Come here. Come on.

1013
01:11:14,978 --> 01:11:17,313
- Are you calling me like a dog?
- What, huh?

1014
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:19,649
- Are you calling me like a dog?
- Who did that?

1015
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:21,317
You want me to say something to him?

1016
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:23,069
- Ha, ha.
- I'll say something to him.

1017
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:26,531
- Okay, so I've seen the stripping.
- Yup.

1018
01:11:26,698 --> 01:11:28,783
Tell me about being an entrepreneur.

1019
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,953
It's "entrepreneur" actually.
It's, uh, French.

1020
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:35,123
You know about the roofing,
and I got a mobile-detailing thing.

1021
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:38,835
But the whole endgame is the custom
furniture business I'm trying to start.

1022
01:11:39,002 --> 01:11:43,131
Custom furniture? So you must be really
good with your hands.

1023
01:11:44,049 --> 01:11:46,467
- I did not say that.
- Yes, I did.

1024
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:49,637
But I'm glad you made that point.
It's very insightful, actually.

1025
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:51,722
- That's a lot of stuff.
- Yes, it is.

1026
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:55,560
If you could wake up and do the one thing
that would make you the happiest....

1027
01:11:55,727 --> 01:11:57,270
- The happiest?
- Yeah, money aside.

1028
01:11:57,437 --> 01:12:01,983
I would wake up on the beach somewhere
just making stuff every day.

1029
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,484
- Really?
- Yeah.

1030
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:06,279
Really? Tables and chairs,
that kind of thing?

1031
01:12:06,446 --> 01:12:09,365
Anything. Everything.
But custom, one-of-a-kind stuff.

1032
01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:13,202
Not the knock-off stuff you see
in people's kitchens from time to time.

1033
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:16,122
Hey. I don't have
a custom furniture-maker man.

1034
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:17,748
- Well, now you do.
- Okay? Heh.

1035
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:20,209
- So are you in business? Why aren't you?
- Heh.

1036
01:12:20,377 --> 01:12:24,714
I will be as soon as the banks start making
the competitive rates and loans.

1037
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:26,591
Look, I've been saving for six years.

1038
01:12:26,758 --> 01:12:29,677
Why do you think I'm doing
all these stupid businesses...

1039
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:34,974
...and the stripping? I've saved about 13
grand. It's gonna happen eventually.

1040
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:38,728
- Wow, 13. That's a lot of ones.
- Heh.

1041
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,605
There were some fives in there.

1042
01:12:40,772 --> 01:12:42,106
No 20s?

1043
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:44,567
You don't want to know
what I have to do for 20s.

1044
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:46,903
- I don't.
- Let's drink these and I'll show you.

1045
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:49,155
- No, that's okay, heh.
- Heh.

1046
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:50,990
So, Miami, huh?

1047
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:52,950
Mm-hm.

1048
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:56,329
- Don't be mad.
- I'm not mad.

1049
01:12:56,496 --> 01:13:00,333
I'm not trying to tell him what to do.
I just don't like it.

1050
01:13:02,169 --> 01:13:07,506
Did you just...? I want to clear something up.
Did you just take my advice?

1051
01:13:07,674 --> 01:13:11,302
By not telling him what to do?
No. I just don't have a choice.

1052
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:15,723
- I think that was something I said to you.
- What, you want some credit?

1053
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:17,308
- Are we fighting?
- Ha, ha.

1054
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:18,935
Is this our first fight?

1055
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:20,311
Come on. Let's make up.

1056
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:22,813
- I don't like being mad at you.
- Look at that face.

1057
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:25,191
- I really don't like being mad at you.
- You guys are going to have fun in Miami.

1058
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:29,028
Just try not to forget
about the normal people.

1059
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:32,323
Like the people who exist in the daylight.
The non-vampires.

1060
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:34,575
- So you're not a vampire?
- No, I'm not a vampire.

1061
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:37,119
Well, this is not going to work out
at all between you and I.

1062
01:13:39,539 --> 01:13:42,833
- A thing for vampires, heh?
- Yeah. Got a bit of a thing.

1063
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:45,002
You want to get something to eat
sometime?

1064
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:47,880
I don't know, just like get some food?

1065
01:13:48,882 --> 01:13:50,883
What do you mean, like a date?

1066
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:55,888
No. If you don't want to call it that, no.

1067
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:57,098
I don't know.

1068
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,850
Why? Because of what's-his-name
that moved to Orlando?

1069
01:14:00,018 --> 01:14:01,060
Paul?

1070
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:05,481
- Yeah. Paul and I are figuring things out.
- Hmm.

1071
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:06,983
How's that going, heh?

1072
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:09,568
- Are you going to weigh in on that too?
- No.

1073
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:13,864
Plus, I don't exactly sport-fuck
my brother's stripper friends.

1074
01:14:14,032 --> 01:14:16,117
I'm sorry, who said anything about that?

1075
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:18,911
I was just talking about talking
and being friends.

1076
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:21,914
If you want to talk,
my door is always open, Mike.

1077
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:24,667
Are you trying to hit on my sister?

1078
01:14:25,252 --> 01:14:29,005
No. I'm sorry, and if I was,
what the hell are you going to do about it?

1079
01:14:29,172 --> 01:14:30,172
Whoa, brother.

1080
01:14:31,508 --> 01:14:32,925
- Not me. Her.
- Heh.

1081
01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:36,220
Oh, my God. Come on, let's do one more.
One more, come on.

1082
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:39,098
Dude, I would love to, but we can't.
You get Dallas' text?

1083
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:41,183
We got a sorority in like a half hour.

1084
01:14:41,601 --> 01:14:43,060
A sorority?

1085
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:46,022
Five hundred bones to rub our nuts...

1086
01:14:46,189 --> 01:14:49,108
- ...on some girl's chest.
- Adam, I see what's happening here.

1087
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:53,279
I ate a Kappa just like this.
I ate a Kappa. I ate a Kappa.

1088
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:56,073
You guys are really.... Have a great time.

1089
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:58,075
Come on. We gotta stop fighting like this.

1090
01:14:58,243 --> 01:15:00,870
- Heh.
- We gotta stop fighting.

1091
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:03,497
Just find your own way back.
I got the keys, right?

1092
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:05,708
You do not have the keys.
Oh, shit, you do.

1093
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:08,544
- I have the keys.
- She's got the keys. We got to go.

1094
01:15:24,144 --> 01:15:26,479
- Good evening. You live here?
- Yeah.

1095
01:15:26,646 --> 01:15:28,606
- Yeah? What's your name?
- Kim.

1096
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:31,025
Kim, can you move back for me, please?

1097
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:34,653
We keep getting complaints
of noise and underage drinking.

1098
01:15:34,821 --> 01:15:37,907
Gentlemen? Everybody's 21 here?

1099
01:15:38,658 --> 01:15:40,951
I might need to check some IDs,
unfortunately.

1100
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:43,162
Can you accompany me in here, please?

1101
01:15:44,664 --> 01:15:46,999
Ladies, everybody's 21 here?

1102
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:48,501
- Yeah.
- Yes?

1103
01:15:48,668 --> 01:15:51,170
She is definitely not 21,
I'm sorry. What's your birthday?

1104
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:53,172
Uh, May 20th, 19....

1105
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:56,384
That's what I thought. Put your hands
on the wall. Everybody sit.

1106
01:15:56,551 --> 01:15:58,552
We're going to be here for a while.

1107
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,222
Can you please spread your legs for me,
ma'am?

1108
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:04,850
You don't have anything sharp on you
that I can stick myself with, do you?

1109
01:16:05,018 --> 01:16:06,936
- No.
- Good.

1110
01:16:07,187 --> 01:16:09,105
Because I do.

1111
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:52,291
Did you see it?

1112
01:17:57,130 --> 01:17:58,589
Hey!

1113
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:01,050
Did you give some Ecstasy to my girl?

1114
01:18:01,301 --> 01:18:02,343
No.

1115
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,803
I said, did you give some Ecstasy
to my chick?

1116
01:18:04,971 --> 01:18:06,055
Hey, fuck off.

1117
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:08,641
Okay. Cool.

1118
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:21,320
Hey!

1119
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:28,827
Hey, back the fuck up. We got to go.
Let's go. Adam, let's go.

1120
01:18:28,995 --> 01:18:30,829
All right, back the fuck up.

1121
01:18:34,167 --> 01:18:36,168
Let's go. Let's go.

1122
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:40,881
Oh, what are you doing, man?
What the fuck are you doing...

1123
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:43,092
...giving pills to girls
that you don't know?

1124
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:45,427
- Shit, dude.
- You're lucky we got out of there.

1125
01:18:45,595 --> 01:18:48,097
- My backpack. We have to go back.
- Fuck your backpack.

1126
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:50,683
No, you don't understand.
It has my fucking pills.

1127
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:53,018
Fuck your pills.
You're going to have to eat it.

1128
01:18:53,186 --> 01:18:56,063
Tobias fronted me pills.
Sell them off for some extra cash.

1129
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:58,816
What the fuck are you doing taking...?
Front from Tobias?

1130
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:00,859
Why is he giving you pills? How many?

1131
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:04,113
Heh, I don't know, man.
Fucking like a hundred.

1132
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:06,448
"Like a hundred," or a hundred?
That's a grand.

1133
01:19:06,616 --> 01:19:08,409
Have to pay every one of those back.

1134
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,494
Fuck, dude. Fuck that. Guess what?

1135
01:19:10,662 --> 01:19:13,330
- What do you mean, "fuck that"?
- I got that equity, baby.

1136
01:19:13,498 --> 01:19:16,542
Dallas gave me that cut in Miami, whoo!

1137
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:20,421
I don't even fucking care
about a fucking grand. Who cares?

1138
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:23,882
Fuck. Damn, that was crazy shit.

1139
01:19:24,551 --> 01:19:26,010
Fuck.

1140
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:47,573
- You bailing on me?
- Nope, not at all.

1141
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:54,705
- Oh, my God. What are you doing here?
- Hey.

1142
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:57,833
I thought you were out of town,
like, forever.

1143
01:19:58,001 --> 01:20:01,211
Yeah, I decided to stay in town.

1144
01:20:01,379 --> 01:20:03,547
- Great. What's up, man? Mike.
- Ryan.

1145
01:20:03,715 --> 01:20:05,424
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- Nice to meet you.

1146
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:10,763
Uh, Ryan, um, is my fiancé.

1147
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:16,060
What?

1148
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:20,272
Are you fucking with me right now?

1149
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,232
I'm gonna go hit the bathroom.

1150
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,777
No. You guys sound like
you got a lot to talk about.

1151
01:20:24,944 --> 01:20:27,321
It's time for me to go stare
in the mirror anyway.

1152
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:29,490
- Nice meeting you. See you, babe.
- Yes, sir.

1153
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,075
Okay.

1154
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:38,791
Hmm....

1155
01:20:38,958 --> 01:20:42,002
Okay. All right, I'm not exactly....

1156
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:46,840
Okay. All right.

1157
01:20:48,843 --> 01:20:50,177
It was good to see you.

1158
01:20:50,428 --> 01:20:53,347
Well, lookie here what the cat dragged in.

1159
01:20:53,598 --> 01:20:54,682
Coño, what happened?

1160
01:20:56,226 --> 01:20:57,726
Uh....

1161
01:20:57,894 --> 01:21:01,230
It was nothing. It was fucked up. Sorry.

1162
01:21:01,398 --> 01:21:04,483
"It was fucked up"? "Sorry"?

1163
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:07,194
Mm-hm.
- That's all you got to say?

1164
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:09,822
I don't know. You really
want to discuss it?

1165
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:13,033
I take it you didn't collect.

1166
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:15,577
Yeah, I'm sorry. I forgot to ask
for the money...

1167
01:21:15,745 --> 01:21:18,205
...as they were throwing beer bottles
at our heads.

1168
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:20,999
It's the last thing
I need for my reputation...

1169
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:22,918
...before we make the big move, Mike.

1170
01:21:23,086 --> 01:21:24,878
I'm sorry.
Are we fucking your reputation up?

1171
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:26,213
Hmm.

1172
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:31,343
The last time I checked,
I think it's the Kid and I's reputation...

1173
01:21:31,511 --> 01:21:34,304
...that's "making the big move"
for you, isn't it?

1174
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,060
What the fuck did you say, buddy?

1175
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:43,605
I don't know, you were standing six feet
away from me. You heard me.

1176
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:47,901
Hey, you might want to check yourself,
old friend.

1177
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:51,321
Nobody walks on water on my team.

1178
01:21:51,489 --> 01:21:53,157
Except for you, right?

1179
01:21:53,908 --> 01:21:55,701
Old friend.

1180
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:57,870
Ah.

1181
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:02,916
What are you thinking about?

1182
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:06,628
Biting the hand that feeds you,
big dog, huh?

1183
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:11,341
You don't fucking feed me, Dallas.

1184
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,888
I can walk right out that door.
Right now.

1185
01:22:16,055 --> 01:22:19,016
And do a fuck of a lot better
than 7.5 percent.

1186
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:21,393
I'm sorry, that used to be 10.

1187
01:22:21,561 --> 01:22:23,103
But you don't.

1188
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:28,108
You didn't. And you won't.

1189
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:29,777
Because you can't.

1190
01:22:29,944 --> 01:22:31,695
I can't? Okay.

1191
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:35,199
So you got to deal with what you got.

1192
01:22:35,366 --> 01:22:36,950
Hey, what's going on?

1193
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:40,204
- That pack you gave me?
- Mm.

1194
01:22:40,872 --> 01:22:43,165
- It's gone.
- That's great.

1195
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:44,541
Gone.

1196
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:46,627
It's "gone" gone.

1197
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:49,630
- You lost it?
- I'm sorry, man.

1198
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:52,633
Fuck sorry. You got to take care of this.

1199
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:54,384
We'll figure it out. It's fine.

1200
01:22:54,552 --> 01:22:56,804
No, you need to figure it out.

1201
01:22:56,971 --> 01:22:58,972
Get the fuck off me.

1202
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:03,560
Seniority don't mean shit around here, man.

1203
01:23:03,728 --> 01:23:06,939
You are worth the cash you
pry out of their fucking purses.

1204
01:23:07,106 --> 01:23:09,024
You know that better than anybody.

1205
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:12,361
You want a bigger piece?
Come up with some fresher shit, man.

1206
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:14,446
You're not getting any younger.

1207
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:18,242
What the fuck are you doing?

1208
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:22,913
I need you doing the sailor routine tonight.
I got four tables of Navy wives stageside.

1209
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:26,416
- Get changed.
- Oh, no. I'm taking your advice.

1210
01:23:26,584 --> 01:23:30,921
Bringing you some fresher shit.
Seeing as I'm getting equity and all.

1211
01:24:44,787 --> 01:24:46,872
Perfect date time.

1212
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,209
Give me the astronaut thing.

1213
01:24:51,377 --> 01:24:53,420
I met this guy....

1214
01:24:53,671 --> 01:24:55,756
You got them going out there, Mike.

1215
01:24:56,257 --> 01:24:58,133
Good job, man.

1216
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:03,180
He's met just about every single
Russian and American astronaut...

1217
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:06,350
...that's ever been in outer space,
living or dead.

1218
01:25:07,935 --> 01:25:10,437
The first man in outer space...

1219
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:13,065
...Russian. Yuri Gagarin.

1220
01:25:13,232 --> 01:25:14,775
- Cosmonaut.
- He's the second one.

1221
01:25:14,942 --> 01:25:17,069
The first one died on reentry.

1222
01:25:17,236 --> 01:25:19,529
We're gonna get fucked up tonight, right?

1223
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:08,930
Mike.

1224
01:27:12,101 --> 01:27:13,143
Mike, hello.

1225
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:17,522
Open up.

1226
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:27,073
- Mike.
- All right. Hold on.

1227
01:27:33,206 --> 01:27:34,539
- Hey.
- Hey.

1228
01:27:34,707 --> 01:27:36,166
You have fun last night?

1229
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:38,460
- What?
- Did you have fun last night?

1230
01:27:38,628 --> 01:27:40,170
Yeah, uh, what's up?

1231
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:41,922
Is Adam here?

1232
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:46,343
He left me weird-sounding voice messages,
sounded fucked up.

1233
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:48,011
And now I can't reach him.

1234
01:27:48,179 --> 01:27:50,430
- Yeah, he's in here.
- Okay. Cool.

1235
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:56,478
Where is he?

1236
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:58,480
Uh, he should be upstairs.

1237
01:27:58,648 --> 01:28:03,777
He's with somebody, though,
so, you know, I'd call out.

1238
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:05,111
Kid.

1239
01:28:07,907 --> 01:28:09,533
Adam?

1240
01:28:09,742 --> 01:28:11,117
Adam. Adam.

1241
01:28:11,285 --> 01:28:12,494
- Fuck.
- Adam.

1242
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:13,995
Hey. Come here.

1243
01:28:15,331 --> 01:28:16,873
Stop. He's fine, he's breathing.

1244
01:28:17,041 --> 01:28:19,501
Oh, my God, Adam.
What the fuck did he take?

1245
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:21,878
Uh, probably just some G.
Open your eyes, dude.

1246
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:24,798
- What the fuck did you do to my brother?
- Relax. Yo, Brooke.

1247
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:26,591
He's breathing. He's fine.

1248
01:28:26,759 --> 01:28:30,679
Get the fuck off me, Mike. I'll fucking kill you.
I will fucking kill you.

1249
01:28:30,847 --> 01:28:32,681
- He's going to be fine, heh.
- He's not okay.

1250
01:28:32,849 --> 01:28:34,599
- Calm down.
- No, shut up. Shut up!

1251
01:28:34,767 --> 01:28:37,310
Shut up. I see you, Mike.
I fucking see you.

1252
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:41,439
You think you have your shit all figured
out, but I fucking see you.

1253
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:44,693
You just need to relax.
You're acting fucking crazy. And I get it.

1254
01:28:44,861 --> 01:28:47,821
You are a bullshit,
30-year-old male stripper.

1255
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:51,908
- Okay. How about just get the fuck out?
- No problem.

1256
01:28:52,076 --> 01:28:55,662
Done. Adam, wake the fuck up.
Adam, please.

1257
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:58,874
Adam, let's go. Come on, Adam.

1258
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:00,876
Adam. God.

1259
01:29:01,043 --> 01:29:03,253
Adam. Wake up. Adam, we have to go.

1260
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:05,130
- Stop.
- No, Mike, this is my brother.

1261
01:29:05,298 --> 01:29:08,592
Brooke, let me please carry him out.
Stop.

1262
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:35,035
I can't do this anymore, Adam.

1263
01:29:40,124 --> 01:29:41,458
You hear me?

1264
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:32,425
Come on, let's go.

1265
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:35,095
You guys need to stop already.

1266
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:39,432
Motherfucker.

1267
01:30:42,645 --> 01:30:44,562
Mike? Get off of him. Hey.

1268
01:30:44,772 --> 01:30:45,814
Hey!

1269
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:50,568
- Fuck off.
- I'm so sorry, primo.

1270
01:30:50,736 --> 01:30:51,778
Sorry? Fuck you, man.

1271
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:53,863
What are you doing breaking
into my house?

1272
01:30:54,031 --> 01:30:55,740
I tried calling your cell, man.

1273
01:30:55,908 --> 01:30:58,535
My cell? Fuck my cell.
What are you fucking doing, man?

1274
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:01,663
I told them not to break shit,
but they don't work for me.

1275
01:31:01,831 --> 01:31:03,665
That did a good job, didn't it?

1276
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:07,293
Look, man, I'm sorry.
We're looking for the Kid, okay?

1277
01:31:07,461 --> 01:31:08,753
Uh, so you brought them here?

1278
01:31:08,921 --> 01:31:11,881
- What are you looking for him for?
- He's late on his front.

1279
01:31:12,049 --> 01:31:13,967
And as you can see, he was due today.

1280
01:31:14,218 --> 01:31:18,054
It's 100 pills. That's 1000 bucks.
I think he's good for that, don't you?

1281
01:31:18,222 --> 01:31:21,474
No, no, no.
Is that what he told you? A hundred?

1282
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:24,728
We went in on a whole pack, hombre.
A whole pack.

1283
01:31:26,856 --> 01:31:29,315
- What's his half?
- Ten grand.

1284
01:31:30,901 --> 01:31:33,319
- What?
- Ten grand.

1285
01:31:33,779 --> 01:31:37,615
I don't know if he lost it,
or if he's just being a fucking kid.

1286
01:31:37,783 --> 01:31:40,535
Either way, it doesn't matter anymore.
Okay?

1287
01:31:41,078 --> 01:31:42,746
Look, you got to...

1288
01:31:44,498 --> 01:31:45,832
What am I...?

1289
01:31:46,751 --> 01:31:49,335
I don't know, I can maybe sign over
the van...

1290
01:31:49,503 --> 01:31:51,671
...until he can figure out
something out.

1291
01:31:52,339 --> 01:31:53,673
Fuck, I don't know, man.

1292
01:31:53,924 --> 01:31:59,262
Come on, primo. The guys I'm rolling with,
they ain't about fucking paperwork, man.

1293
01:32:03,642 --> 01:32:07,062
If you want, I can talk to my guys
and we can try to get him another day.

1294
01:32:07,229 --> 01:32:09,731
And what the fuck would that do?
He doesn't have it.

1295
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:12,776
Hey, look...
I just hate to see you doing this.

1296
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:15,153
Just don't give him any more shit to sell.

1297
01:32:15,321 --> 01:32:17,906
No, that's fine.
He's starting to act like a real punk.

1298
01:32:18,074 --> 01:32:21,326
- One of us should talk to him.
- Well, you've done enough, haven't you?

1299
01:32:21,494 --> 01:32:22,786
I'll talk to him. It's fine.

1300
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:55,026
Hey.

1301
01:32:56,153 --> 01:32:57,403
Um....

1302
01:32:57,571 --> 01:32:59,364
I'm looking for Adam.
He's not picking up his phone.

1303
01:32:59,532 --> 01:33:02,158
- Is he all right?
- Yeah, he's okay.

1304
01:33:02,326 --> 01:33:04,911
I mean, he doesn't live here anymore.

1305
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:07,163
Where is he?

1306
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:10,291
I'm not sure. I think he's with Nora.

1307
01:33:14,922 --> 01:33:19,134
Okay, cool. Just, uh, let him know
that I'm looking for him if you see him.

1308
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:23,721
Ha, this is so much bullshit.

1309
01:33:23,889 --> 01:33:25,098
You know that, right?

1310
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:28,852
This is really how we're going to end this?
Are you fucking serious?

1311
01:33:31,021 --> 01:33:34,816
- I said everything I needed to say.
- You had a lot to say yesterday.

1312
01:33:34,984 --> 01:33:37,902
You don't have anything else to say?
You want to add onto that?

1313
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:40,488
You damn sure didn't let me talk,
so let me talk now.

1314
01:33:40,656 --> 01:33:42,282
I'm sorry that I fucked it up.

1315
01:33:42,449 --> 01:33:45,702
I didn't mean to do that.
I didn't want to fuck it up. I promised...

1316
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:49,289
...that I would take care of him,
and I didn't, and I'm sorry about that.

1317
01:33:49,456 --> 01:33:51,249
You're the last person that I...

1318
01:33:53,794 --> 01:33:56,004
Yeah, I believe you...

1319
01:33:56,172 --> 01:33:58,631
...and I know you're basically
a good person.

1320
01:33:58,799 --> 01:34:00,842
Adam was...

1321
01:34:03,095 --> 01:34:05,597
...going to do whatever Adam wanted to do.

1322
01:34:07,558 --> 01:34:09,350
I just can't be around your lifestyle.

1323
01:34:09,518 --> 01:34:13,146
You can't be around my...?
I'm not my lifestyle.

1324
01:34:15,399 --> 01:34:18,484
That's who you think...?
That isn't fucking...

1325
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:22,447
I'm not... Am I Magic, uh...?

1326
01:34:22,615 --> 01:34:24,657
Am I Magic Mike right now talking to you?

1327
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:30,371
I'm not my goddamn job.
That's not who...

1328
01:34:30,539 --> 01:34:34,542
That's not what I do. That's not me.
It is what I do, but it's not who I am.

1329
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:36,461
I'm not just...

1330
01:34:37,838 --> 01:34:39,380
That's why I want to go to Miami.

1331
01:34:39,548 --> 01:34:42,050
I don't want to fucking be
some 40-year-old stripper.

1332
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:44,344
I want to own something.
I want to actually...

1333
01:34:49,683 --> 01:34:52,018
I've been trying to, this whole time...

1334
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:59,484
So you don't believe anything
that I've said to you?

1335
01:34:59,652 --> 01:35:01,861
You don't... Right now.
Nothing. I'm just...

1336
01:35:02,112 --> 01:35:03,446
You don't believe any of it?

1337
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:07,242
Mike, I think the question is,
do you believe it?

1338
01:35:10,037 --> 01:35:14,332
I just think that Miami is going to be
a bigger, badder version of this.

1339
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:16,542
But good luck to you.

1340
01:35:18,045 --> 01:35:20,046
If you believe it, good luck to you.

1341
01:35:20,631 --> 01:35:22,215
And Adam too.

1342
01:35:22,633 --> 01:35:24,592
But I'm going to be here.

1343
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:45,488
Hey.

1344
01:35:46,699 --> 01:35:47,824
I, uh....

1345
01:35:48,492 --> 01:35:51,411
I want to say thank you about the money.

1346
01:35:51,578 --> 01:35:53,496
I know how much that shit meant to you...

1347
01:35:53,664 --> 01:35:57,375
...especially because of that
furniture crap you wanted to do.

1348
01:36:00,254 --> 01:36:01,587
I, uh....

1349
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:07,427
I'm gonna pay you back every last cent.
I want you to know that.

1350
01:36:10,222 --> 01:36:11,264
All right.

1351
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:15,435
Man, we're gonna look back in 20 years.
You're gonna be dead, probably...

1352
01:36:15,602 --> 01:36:20,523
...but I can look back in 20 years and look
at the shit that we've done together, man.

1353
01:36:20,691 --> 01:36:24,569
Fuck. Look where I was three months ago.

1354
01:36:25,362 --> 01:36:26,863
Three months ago.

1355
01:36:27,114 --> 01:36:29,073
Look at where I am now.

1356
01:36:30,993 --> 01:36:32,869
I can't thank you enough.

1357
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:35,705
Fuck, man. I was nowhere.

1358
01:36:36,790 --> 01:36:38,666
I have money.

1359
01:36:38,834 --> 01:36:41,127
I can fuck who I want to fuck.

1360
01:36:41,462 --> 01:36:44,380
I have freedom, thanks to you.

1361
01:36:45,632 --> 01:36:48,301
And I'm having a fucking ball.

1362
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:53,973
And we're going to have a fucking ball
in Miami, man.

1363
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:57,060
So can you smile? Can you look at me?

1364
01:36:59,313 --> 01:37:01,105
I only have one thing to say.

1365
01:37:01,273 --> 01:37:03,816
And that is:
To my best friend.

1366
01:37:06,487 --> 01:37:11,574
A guy who has given me more in this
lifetime than I could ever ask for.

1367
01:37:13,827 --> 01:37:15,828
And to bright futures.

1368
01:37:18,123 --> 01:37:20,166
Ladies of Tampa

1369
01:37:24,296 --> 01:37:29,133
The first time that you
ever walked into my life

1370
01:37:30,803 --> 01:37:35,932
In oh many ways you all became my wife

1371
01:37:37,393 --> 01:37:39,727
Ladies, yeah, I'm talkin' to you

1372
01:37:42,272 --> 01:37:45,691
Ladies of Tampa

1373
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:51,280
Even though we gotta go

1374
01:37:51,615 --> 01:37:54,617
There's one thing you gotta know

1375
01:37:55,577 --> 01:38:01,040
Ain't no matter
How much you love me for sure

1376
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:04,127
Ooh, ooh, ooh

1377
01:38:04,336 --> 01:38:06,129
I'll always love you more

1378
01:38:08,757 --> 01:38:11,843
I'll always love you more than you know

1379
01:38:12,010 --> 01:38:16,055
You got me tied to a chain
I'm just a slave to your soul

1380
01:38:16,223 --> 01:38:21,519
And there ain't nothin' I can do about it
That's fo' sho

1381
01:38:25,315 --> 01:38:27,650
Ladies of Tampa

1382
01:39:09,234 --> 01:39:11,068
- I could be a friend to you.
- Ha, ha.

1383
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:12,737
What about romance?

1384
01:39:12,988 --> 01:39:15,823
Hit them with the long arm of love, baby.

1385
01:39:16,158 --> 01:39:18,951
- My good friend, Andy.
- Ha, ha.

1386
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:21,078
I'm just saying you always put up a fight.

1387
01:39:21,246 --> 01:39:24,832
Anaconda Part 3.

1388
01:39:25,209 --> 01:39:26,667
Hey, uh, what about...?

1389
01:41:02,264 --> 01:41:03,431
Whoo!

1390
01:41:03,599 --> 01:41:04,640
- Yeah.
- Motherfucker.

1391
01:41:04,808 --> 01:41:06,976
Dallas be riding again.

1392
01:41:07,144 --> 01:41:09,437
Whoo! It's a fucking revival.

1393
01:41:09,771 --> 01:41:11,397
Huh!

1394
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:14,525
Hot damn. It feels good to be back
on that fucking horse again.

1395
01:41:14,693 --> 01:41:18,070
- That was the old stuff.
- Oh, shit.

1396
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:19,614
Still got it.

1397
01:41:19,781 --> 01:41:21,991
Y'all ready to rock a little
and fucking rein them in?

1398
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:23,951
Yeah.

1399
01:41:24,119 --> 01:41:25,161
Yeah.

1400
01:41:25,329 --> 01:41:26,412
Where's Mike?

1401
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:27,997
He's gone.

1402
01:41:28,165 --> 01:41:29,206
Mikey?

1403
01:41:29,374 --> 01:41:32,084
He went back to take a piss.
He should be back any second.

1404
01:41:32,252 --> 01:41:33,544
Mikey's gone.

1405
01:41:33,712 --> 01:41:35,421
What do you mean, he's gone?

1406
01:41:36,173 --> 01:41:39,675
I thought he was going to go take a piss
and he went out the back door.

1407
01:41:41,261 --> 01:41:42,928
Hey, Mike, yo.

1408
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:45,097
Let's go, we're up.

1409
01:41:48,852 --> 01:41:50,853
He's coming back, man.

1410
01:41:53,273 --> 01:41:55,733
All right, come here.

1411
01:41:59,738 --> 01:42:01,572
You ready to be the man?

1412
01:42:02,449 --> 01:42:05,534
- Are you ready to be the man?
- Yes, I'm ready.

1413
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:08,746
- I've been waiting for this for a long time.
- It's all yours. Come here.

1414
01:42:10,123 --> 01:42:12,625
Start right fucking now.
Let's make it fucking count.

1415
01:42:12,793 --> 01:42:15,628
All the way. Let's go.
Kid's in, Mike's out.

1416
01:42:15,796 --> 01:42:20,466
Let's bring this motherfucker down
all the way to Miami. Let's go. Hey.

1417
01:42:20,634 --> 01:42:24,095
All right, ladies. So we know we made fire.

1418
01:42:24,262 --> 01:42:26,889
We know we got fire,
now we got to make it rain.

1419
01:42:27,057 --> 01:42:30,685
Can you make it rain, ladies?
Can you make it rain?

1420
01:42:30,852 --> 01:42:33,896
Let's give it up for the last time
on this stage.

1421
01:42:34,064 --> 01:42:39,652
The one, the only, your very own,
the Cock-rocking Kings of Tampa.

1422
01:42:54,876 --> 01:42:55,960
Hey.

1423
01:42:56,461 --> 01:42:58,379
What are you doing here?

1424
01:43:00,424 --> 01:43:01,716
Um....

1425
01:43:02,884 --> 01:43:04,885
Aren't you supposed to be at the show?

1426
01:43:09,141 --> 01:43:11,142
Can I, uh, um...?

1427
01:43:12,144 --> 01:43:14,395
I just need to talk.

1428
01:43:20,152 --> 01:43:21,485
Yeah, okay.

1429
01:43:22,154 --> 01:43:23,487
Come on in.

1430
01:43:45,635 --> 01:43:47,595
Um....

1431
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:51,515
I, uh... I just came by to...

1432
01:43:51,683 --> 01:43:53,768
Look, before you say anything...

1433
01:43:53,935 --> 01:43:55,603
...I just need you to know that...

1434
01:43:55,771 --> 01:44:00,149
...when you came by this morning,
Adam hadn't told me what you did for him.

1435
01:44:00,317 --> 01:44:02,735
And that was really a lot of money.

1436
01:44:02,903 --> 01:44:06,322
- You did not have to do that.
- I didn't do it for him.

1437
01:44:07,532 --> 01:44:10,576
Look, that's not even why I came by.
I just...

1438
01:44:11,828 --> 01:44:15,456
Ah, um, look, I'm not going to Miami.

1439
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:21,295
- Really?
- Yeah. I think you're right. I'm done.

1440
01:44:23,590 --> 01:44:25,216
Wow.

1441
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:28,177
What are you gonna do?

1442
01:44:31,223 --> 01:44:34,683
Heh, I don't know. I
guess I need a new plan.

1443
01:44:40,273 --> 01:44:43,359
Do you want to get some food
and talk about it?

1444
01:44:48,698 --> 01:44:50,950
What, like a date?

1445
01:44:52,828 --> 01:44:54,537
Well....

1446
01:44:55,372 --> 01:44:57,790
What would Tall Paul say, huh?

1447
01:44:58,458 --> 01:45:03,838
Tall Paul can't say anything anymore.
I broke up with him.

1448
01:45:06,132 --> 01:45:07,800
He didn't like breakfast food?

1449
01:45:10,136 --> 01:45:11,720
Not as much as I do.

1450
01:45:11,888 --> 01:45:17,476
This is a good thing. In that case,
I would love to get some breakfast.

1451
01:45:17,644 --> 01:45:18,853
Okay.

1452
01:45:19,729 --> 01:45:21,272
Let's go get something to eat.

1453
01:45:21,439 --> 01:45:26,360
The thing is I only go to one place.
It's my favorite place.

1454
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:29,488
They have the best omelets.
They know my order. I walk in...

1455
01:45:29,656 --> 01:45:32,491
...the food's basically on the table.
They'd help you out too.

1456
01:45:32,659 --> 01:45:35,536
Get some waffles for you, pancakes,
whatever you want.

1457
01:45:35,704 --> 01:45:38,330
I love waffles. Let's go there.

1458
01:45:39,082 --> 01:45:41,876
The problem is it doesn't open until 6 a.m.

1459
01:45:48,508 --> 01:45:50,509
That's like seven hours from now.

1460
01:45:52,429 --> 01:45:53,762
Mm-hm.

1461
01:45:54,848 --> 01:45:56,140
Yeah.

1462
01:45:59,185 --> 01:46:01,270
What could we do with seven hours?
