00:00:05,889 --> 00:00:08,382
- [Dr. Phil] To fit the
guidelines of your objective,

5
00:00:08,382 --> 00:00:11,322
which was to essentially rid society

6
00:00:11,322 --> 00:00:12,941
of an unwanted element.

7
00:00:12,941 --> 00:00:15,677
To trim the fat, so they say.

8
00:00:15,677 --> 00:00:18,345
We uncovered a reactive element

9
00:00:18,345 --> 00:00:21,713
to respond only to melanin genetics.

10
00:00:21,713 --> 00:00:25,200
You see one, of the
major reasons we have not

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,132
revisited this type of chemical attack

12
00:00:28,132 --> 00:00:30,559
was the inability to prevent whites

13
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:32,791
from using the drug.

14
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:35,374
The joy with this melon tracer,

15
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:39,693
the drug only works on black users!

16
00:00:41,318 --> 00:00:42,526
- [Phil's college] Listen, I don't get,

17
00:00:42,526 --> 00:00:44,297
while you want to make a drug

18
00:00:44,297 --> 00:00:46,703
that makes black people kill each other

19
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:50,258
but, what did they ever do to you?

20
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:53,517
- You see now that you
do understand me at all.

21
00:00:53,517 --> 00:00:56,635
I don't want to kill all black people.

22
00:00:56,635 --> 00:01:00,737
I just want to keep this
great country under control.

23
00:01:00,737 --> 00:01:03,978
Blacks will control everything,

24
00:01:03,978 --> 00:01:06,772
if they're left unchecked.

25
00:01:06,772 --> 00:01:07,784
They took over sports.

26
00:01:07,784 --> 00:01:09,010
They took over entertainment.

27
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,000
They put one in The White House.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,833
Hey!

29
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:13,969
They're gonna be the masters,

30
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:16,591

- As my colleague says,

38
00:01:37,234 --> 00:01:41,824
this drug will effect
millions of born and unborn

39
00:01:41,824 --> 00:01:44,907
and weigh heavily upon the conscience

40
00:01:45,997 --> 00:01:48,080
of mankind if done wrong.

41
00:01:51,884 --> 00:01:54,103
- [Stephanie] How do we market this drug?

42
00:01:54,103 --> 00:01:55,831
- The most commonly prescribed drugs

43
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:57,755
in the African-American community

44
00:01:57,755 --> 00:02:01,692
like, high blood pressure,
diabetic medication.

45
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:03,455
This kind of thing.

46
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:04,695
- [Stephanie] Is this how
you've distributed the drug

47
00:02:04,695 --> 00:02:06,979
for testing in Chicago?

48
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:08,184
- Actually, no.

49
00:02:08,184 --> 00:02:10,171
We had great success

50
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:14,698
with the street drug Molly,
in the Chicago tests.

51
00:02:14,698 --> 00:02:18,968
80% of the African-Americans
incarcerated for homicide

52
00:02:18,968 --> 00:02:20,970
during the trial period,

53
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,535
tested positive for our laced Molly.

54
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:27,868
(tense music continues)

55
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,870
(meeting attendees softly chatting)

56
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,430
- We have been analyzing a promising area

57
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,781
in Los Angeles

58
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:36,033
that's more diverse

59
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:39,086
and shows favorable
conditions for testing.

60
00:02:39,086 --> 00:02:41,795
We should conduct the tests there.

61
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,798
- I personally believe you've
done an outstanding job

62
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:45,610
with the drug, Philip.

63
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,866
And based on the data you've presented,

64
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:52,409
I'm convinced we should move
forward to mass production.

65
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,075
- Let's not jump the gun, James.

66
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:56,662
We haven't given ourselves
the appropriate time

67
00:02:56,662 --> 00:02:59,209
to judge the long-term
effects of the drug.

68
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:00,554
- What more do you want?

69
00:03:00,554 --> 00:03:02,891
Phillip says the drug
makes them kill each other.

70
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,762
Our hands are clean and the job's done.

71
00:03:05,762 --> 00:03:10,679
- What's stopping them from
taking the drug and killing us?

72
00:03:11,698 --> 00:03:15,516
I'm afraid that in our
hurry to remove them,

73
00:03:15,516 --> 00:03:16,599
we remove us.

74
00:03:19,448 --> 00:03:20,988
- Let me say something.

75
00:03:20,988 --> 00:03:23,646
I respect Stephanie Powers, opinion.

76
00:03:23,646 --> 00:03:24,649
You're very cautious.

77
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:25,860
It's a business.

78
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,686
Mr. Cunningham brings up a good point.

79
00:03:27,686 --> 00:03:30,179
Dr. Stine has good credentials.

80
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:31,577
Let's put it to a vote.

81
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:34,744
All in favor of more testing, say aye.

82
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,543
- Aye.

83
00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:38,899
- Aye.

about my hood in L.A.

93
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:30,132
Because we was like ground zero

94

The main nigga's.

96
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:36,039
Basically I was running the dope house

97
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:37,753
off of 7th and Westlake

98
00:04:37,753 --> 00:04:39,251

Open the fucking gate.

104
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:51,608
Get the fuck up, c'mon!

105
00:04:51,608 --> 00:04:54,092
- I ended up getting robbed my suppliers.

106
00:04:54,092 --> 00:04:55,169
End up on the big boss,

107
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,752

110
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:00,022
- $1000 right here.

111
00:05:00,022 --> 00:05:02,458
All up on a bitch ass though, right?

112
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,715
For a bitch ass motherfucker.

113
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:05,548
- [Passenger] Yeah.

114
00:05:05,548 --> 00:05:06,867
- You take care of Nitty?

115
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:08,476
- Nitty had already made that move

116
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:09,703
and caught me slipping.

117
00:05:09,703 --> 00:05:10,934

Pew, pew.

120
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:16,042

121
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:17,779
first person I touched
just so happened to be

122
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:19,374
the person that was carrying the drugs

123
00:05:19,374 --> 00:05:21,041
from Chicago to L.A.

124
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:24,758
I actually was the first
person to be infected

125
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,227
from the pills.

126
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:27,837
I popped one of them pills,

127
00:05:27,837 --> 00:05:29,350

00:05:51,112 --> 00:05:52,737
Keep that nigga in the trunk though.

I'm telling you homie.

146
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:02,167
I got a whole different concept, man.

147
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:03,558
Just keep him on ice.

148
00:06:03,558 --> 00:06:05,392
Don't even trip.

149
00:06:05,392 --> 00:06:07,413

00:06:07,413 --> 00:06:08,514

00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:26,938
I'm cut his motherfucking head off,

156
00:06:26,938 --> 00:06:27,875

157
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:31,187
and take it to his momma house.

158
00:06:31,187 --> 00:06:32,166
Nah, I'm just fucking with you.

159
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,110
He said, "Leave that nigga in the trunk."

160
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,086
Leave the pussy in the truck.

You were unconscious.

254
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:13,734
- [Big] Yeah, that tends to happen

255
00:11:13,734 --> 00:11:16,451
when you're losing so much blood so fast.

256
00:11:16,451 --> 00:11:17,928

267
00:11:40,886 --> 00:11:44,035
Motherfucking Peaches, girl.

268
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:44,868
You think you was just gonna walk

274
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,491
- Bitch, I don't want

275
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:56,094

00:11:56,094 --> 00:11:58,356
We both know that I saved

So I took a knife

280
00:12:02,415 --> 00:12:04,284

281
00:12:04,284 --> 00:12:07,617

282
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:13,076

00:12:13,076 --> 00:12:14,504
- Big, I need your help.

284
00:12:14,504 --> 00:12:17,739
I need you to find somebody for me.

- Big, money.

288
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,765
Lot's of money.

289
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:26,598
- I already told you,

290
00:12:26,598 --> 00:12:29,040
I don't want your fucking money.

291

- Just sit that down for over here,

296
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,636
just sit it down.

297
00:12:39,636 --> 00:12:41,521
- You can't even handle this shit.

298
00:12:41,521 --> 00:12:42,618
You can't do nothing with this.

299
00:12:42,618 --> 00:12:43,451
- Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on-

300
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:45,636
- And besides, this is Nino's shit.

301

307
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,854
I just told you, this is Nino's shit.

308
00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:56,268
- Girl, you right.

309
00:12:56,268 --> 00:12:59,277
Let me see you do a little

(Big slapping Peaches)

312
00:13:02,204 --> 00:13:03,559
- [Big's Goon] Damn, what the fuck?

313
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,732
- You'll get the fuck outta here.

314
00:13:04,732 --> 00:13:06,008
Let me talk to her by myself.

315
00:13:06,008 --> 00:13:07,416

316
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,666

317
00:13:13,763 --> 00:13:17,930
(mellow instrumental music plays)

318
00:13:22,816 --> 00:13:25,288
(knocking on door)

319
00:13:25,288 --> 00:13:26,486
- Yo!

320
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:27,473

321
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,398
- Wake up.

322
00:13:28,398 --> 00:13:29,664
You know who it is.

323
00:13:29,664 --> 00:13:31,063
Open that door.

324
00:13:31,063 --> 00:13:32,667
(Door creaking open)
What up Peaches?

325
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:34,156
What's popping girl?

326
00:13:34,156 --> 00:13:34,989

327
00:13:34,989 --> 00:13:36,017
What the fuck you want?

328
00:13:36,017 --> 00:13:37,307
- Just coming to check on my people.

329
00:13:37,307 --> 00:13:38,532
I ain't seen Nino for a minute,

330
00:13:38,532 --> 00:13:39,898
so I'm wondering where my nigga at.

331
00:13:39,898 --> 00:13:40,731
That's all.

332
00:13:40,731 --> 00:13:41,564
- Well, you know what?

333
00:13:41,564 --> 00:13:43,364
That nigga out there,
handling his damn business-

334
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,392
- Right.
- Shit.

335
00:13:44,392 --> 00:13:45,225
- Okay, okay.

336
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:46,058
I was just checking.

337
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,368
No reason to be all angry.

338
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,500
Tell the nigga I came by.

339
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,333
- What the fuck.

340
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,166
Get outta here.

341
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:50,999
- You here though.

342
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:51,832
- [Peaches] I don't know
where the fuck he at.

343
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,613
- All right. I see that gun.

344
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:54,760
- Yeah, you see that shit.

345
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,286
(door creaking closed)

346
00:13:57,286 --> 00:14:00,119
(Peaches sighing)

347
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:05,714
- Nino, I hope everything's all right.

348
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:09,214
(foreboding music begins)

349
00:14:12,303 --> 00:14:14,788
(Nino knocking on door)

350
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:18,538
(foreboding music continues)

351
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,872
- Nino! Is that you?

352
00:14:22,872 --> 00:14:23,705
- Is Chris in there?

353
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:24,788
I need to see Chris.

354
00:14:24,788 --> 00:14:25,643
- What's wrong with you?

355
00:14:25,643 --> 00:14:26,922
What happened to you?

356
00:14:26,922 --> 00:14:27,755
- Is Chris in there?

357
00:14:27,755 --> 00:14:29,339
I need to see Chris.

358
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:30,922
- Hold on. Hold on.

359
00:14:32,523 --> 00:14:36,273
(foreboding music continues)

360
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:41,896
- Chris! Get in here! Now!

361
00:14:42,854 --> 00:14:44,106
Now!

362
00:14:44,106 --> 00:14:44,996
- The fucks going on?

363
00:14:44,996 --> 00:14:46,024
- It's Nino!

364
00:14:46,024 --> 00:14:48,503
He's bleeding from the motherfucking face.

365
00:14:48,503 --> 00:14:49,336
- What?
- I'm not letting him in

366

547
00:20:16,941 --> 00:20:18,274

00:20:20,642 --> 00:20:21,809
God damn King!

549
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,423
(tense music begins)

550
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:40,151
- [Chris] Oh shit.

551
00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:48,499

This motherfucker Nino

555
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:55,213
He got a God damn dead body in the car

556
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:57,697
in front of my house.

557
00:20:57,697 --> 00:20:58,530
What the fuck you mean,

558
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,134
"There's a dead body
in front of my house?"

559
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:03,655
This nigga Nino is on one right now.

560
00:21:03,655 --> 00:21:04,488

561
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,953

562
00:21:13,924 --> 00:21:17,591
(water running from faucet)

563
00:21:25,657 --> 00:21:28,683
(Nino groaning)

564
00:21:28,683 --> 00:21:29,850
- That's nice.

565
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:34,087
(Nino mumbling incoherently to himself)

566
00:21:34,087 --> 00:21:35,960
- [Dr. Phil] My drug,

00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,793

00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,458
I call it, "Joy."

569
00:21:43,441 --> 00:21:47,191
(Nino rambling incoherently)

570
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:53,788
(Chris's girl rambling incoherently)

571
00:21:55,829 --> 00:21:57,547
- Are you okay?

572
00:21:57,547 --> 00:22:00,501
(foreboding music begin)

573
00:22:00,501 --> 00:22:02,565
- Are you okay?

574
00:22:02,565 --> 00:22:06,232
(foreboding music swelling)

575
00:22:10,712 --> 00:22:13,037
(Chris's girl gasping)

576
00:22:13,037 --> 00:22:14,605
- [Chris] I'm sorry baby, I'm sorry.

577
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:17,022
I'ma shoot this motherfucker.

578
00:22:19,412 --> 00:22:20,951

00:22:20,951 --> 00:22:22,401
You was right.

00:22:22,401 --> 00:22:25,662
This is one crazy motherfucker right here.

He on something.

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,280
Kill this motherfucker right now.

584
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,453
Shit man, motherfuckers be tripping.

00:22:36,453 --> 00:22:37,501
Damn.

586
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:38,838
Can't get a break 'round here.

587
00:22:38,838 --> 00:22:40,852
(Chris's girl breathing heavily)

588
00:22:40,852 --> 00:22:42,309
- Did you see him?

589
00:22:42,309 --> 00:22:43,142
- What happened?

590
00:22:43,142 --> 00:22:44,596
- Did you see him?

591
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:45,429
Did you see him?

592
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:47,404
His eyes turned black.

593
00:22:47,404 --> 00:22:49,245
He is the devil.

594
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:50,801
He's the devil!

595
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:51,803
He's the devil!

596
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,421
- [Chris] Calm yo ass down.

597
00:22:53,421 --> 00:22:55,519
Girl, what the fuck is you doing?

598
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:56,936
Calm yo ass down.

599
00:22:58,553 --> 00:23:00,196

600
00:23:00,196 --> 00:23:01,029
Wake up!

00:23:02,744 --> 00:23:05,069
What the fuck happened to you?

602
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:07,986
- [Nino] Hold on, hold on, hold on.

603
00:23:10,219 --> 00:23:11,892
- Oh my God!

604
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:12,795

605
00:23:12,795 --> 00:23:15,309

- Wait! We leaving! We leaving!

608
00:23:17,751 --> 00:23:18,901
- Don't say shit to me.

609
00:23:18,901 --> 00:23:20,181

Hurry up, God damn it.

613

Don't ever come around here

614
00:23:28,357 --> 00:23:32,060
or I'ma bust a cap in somebodies ass.

615
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,592
The fucks wrong with y'all?

616
00:23:33,592 --> 00:23:34,425

00:23:34,425 --> 00:23:35,258

618
00:23:36,383 --> 00:23:38,172

622
00:23:41,035 --> 00:23:42,646

623
00:23:42,646 --> 00:23:45,887
(car whooshing past)

624
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:49,387
(cartoonish music begins)

625
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:58,316
- Man, how she got outta here?

626
00:23:58,316 --> 00:23:59,649
Man, she's good.

627
00:24:00,948 --> 00:24:03,273
You know yo momma should

628
00:24:03,273 --> 00:24:05,939
- Yeah but mommy's at school right now.

629
00:24:05,939 --> 00:24:07,247

630
00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:10,411
She done left me with the...

631
00:24:10,411 --> 00:24:11,459
Who you like doing your hair better?

00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:12,792
Me or your mom?

633
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:14,134
- You.

634
00:24:14,134 --> 00:24:15,373
- [AK] You do, baby?

635
00:24:15,373 --> 00:24:16,811
Okay.

636
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:18,331
Well you don't be saying that,

637
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:21,192
I thought you said that when I do it,

638
00:24:21,192 --> 00:24:22,839
like your hair starts...

639
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:25,113
Your hair is tender.

640
00:24:25,113 --> 00:24:25,946
Huh?

641
00:24:26,821 --> 00:24:28,744
(phone vibrating)

642
00:24:28,744 --> 00:24:29,577
(phone vibrating)

643
00:24:29,577 --> 00:24:31,399
- Mommy gonna make it better.

644
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:32,813
Look, hold up.

645
00:24:32,813 --> 00:24:33,646
(phone vibrating)

646
00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:34,479
- Hello.

647
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:37,317
- [Dr. Phil] Yes, hello.

00:24:37,317 --> 00:24:38,977

649
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,672
- Hold on baby, okay?

650
00:24:40,672 --> 00:24:41,922
Watch cartoons.

651
00:24:43,086 --> 00:24:44,416
Daddy will be right back.

652
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,601
Who is this? What's up?

653
00:24:45,601 --> 00:24:47,001
- [Dr Phil] I got your number

654
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:48,644
from a mutual friend,

655
00:24:48,644 --> 00:24:49,815
Aux.

656
00:24:49,815 --> 00:24:53,403
- Aux? He should have told
you that our business is done.

657
00:24:53,403 --> 00:24:54,952
- [Dr Phil] He informed me,

658
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,237
that you could help me
with a small matter.

659
00:24:57,237 --> 00:25:00,695
So frankly, we don't
have any other choice.

660
00:25:00,695 --> 00:25:01,862
- I'm not into

661
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,649
other peoples problems.

662
00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:06,378
So, you know,

663
00:25:06,378 --> 00:25:07,211
I can't fuck with you.

664
00:25:07,211 --> 00:25:11,794
- [Dr Phil] How about $100,000
to make it your problem?

665
00:25:13,711 --> 00:25:15,131
- You just made your problem, my problem.

666
00:25:15,131 --> 00:25:17,370
What's happening? Holla at me.

667
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:21,221
(Nino breathing heavily)

668
00:25:21,221 --> 00:25:22,054
- Bitch!

669
00:25:25,952 --> 00:25:28,571
- Yeah, I just knocked
your motherfucking ass out!

670
00:25:28,571 --> 00:25:31,007
Now get the fuck on.

671
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:33,667
(Willy laughing)

672
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:35,737
- Damn, You just gonna let
the nigga do you like that?

673
00:25:35,737 --> 00:25:37,557
You better go handle yo
motherfucking business.

674
00:25:37,557 --> 00:25:38,573
- On the real nigga, you need some help?

675
00:25:38,573 --> 00:25:40,573
- Nah nigga, I got this.

676
00:25:44,003 --> 00:25:47,586
(atmospheric music begins)

677
00:25:51,221 --> 00:25:52,777
- Nino, what you doing here?

678
00:25:52,777 --> 00:25:54,346
- So this the part where
I must be dreaming.

679
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:56,390
Bitch! What the fuck you doing here?

680
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,640
Fuck you nigga!

681
00:26:00,645 --> 00:26:02,326
(vacuum cleaner sucking)

682
00:26:02,326 --> 00:26:04,326
I can't get all this up.

683
00:26:05,382 --> 00:26:06,965
This a lot of dirt.

684
00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:13,371
- That's 'cause everybody
in the game is dirty.

685
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:14,925
- Nigga, you dead.

686
00:26:14,925 --> 00:26:19,580
- If I'm dead, how come I was
fucking yo bitch last week?

687
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,330
(Nino screaming)

688
00:26:23,388 --> 00:26:24,942
- No nigga, I got this.

689
00:26:24,942 --> 00:26:26,648
- You should kill the cop first.

690
00:26:26,648 --> 00:26:29,561
- Look. I murder for
whoever paying the most.

691
00:26:29,561 --> 00:26:32,439
(Nino laughing)

692
00:26:32,439 --> 00:26:35,589
- Fuck Nitty. I'm running shit.

693
00:26:35,589 --> 00:26:37,133
- Nah nigga, you ain't...

694
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:39,022
I'ma kill you next bitch.

695
00:26:39,022 --> 00:26:41,829
- I have a gun and I'm gonna shoot you.

696
00:26:41,829 --> 00:26:43,044
(gun firing)

697
00:26:43,044 --> 00:26:46,294
(Nino gasping for air)

698
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,054
(Peaches knocking aggressively on door)

699
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:03,137
- Damn, Nino!

700
00:27:03,994 --> 00:27:04,827
- Bitch shut the fuck up-

701
00:27:04,827 --> 00:27:06,590
- What the fuck happened to you?

702
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,423
Oh my God!

703
00:27:09,034 --> 00:27:09,867
(door slamming shut)

704
00:27:09,867 --> 00:27:13,367
(atmospheric music plays)

705
00:27:20,215 --> 00:27:22,048
- Get the fuck off me.

706
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,518
- Don't touch that shit bitch.

707
00:27:29,518 --> 00:27:31,605
- Damn! What the fuck
happened to your face?

708
00:27:31,605 --> 00:27:32,438
- I'm all right. I told you,

709
00:27:32,438 --> 00:27:33,412
I'm all right.

710
00:27:33,412 --> 00:27:34,576
- Man, what the fuck.

711
00:27:34,576 --> 00:27:35,519
Who's house is this?

712
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:37,124
Is this where the fuck
you've been in all this time?

713
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:37,957
- Nah bitch!

714
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:39,999
I've been in a motherfucking
truck dying, bitch.

715
00:27:39,999 --> 00:27:41,183
- Man, who's house is this?

716
00:27:41,183 --> 00:27:42,524
- This one of Wizdom's cribs.

717
00:27:42,524 --> 00:27:43,422
- What?

718
00:27:43,422 --> 00:27:45,235
You mean to say you called that bitch

719
00:27:45,235 --> 00:27:46,552
before you called me?

720
00:27:46,552 --> 00:27:48,481
After all the shit I done did, Nino.

721
00:27:48,481 --> 00:27:49,314
For real. Really?

722
00:27:49,314 --> 00:27:53,112
(upbeat music begins)

723
00:27:53,112 --> 00:27:54,771
- Nino!

724
00:27:54,771 --> 00:27:56,074
You here?

725
00:27:56,074 --> 00:28:00,991
(Wizdom's heels clicking across the floor)

726
00:28:03,128 --> 00:28:05,111
- Who are you?

727
00:28:05,111 --> 00:28:07,694
- Oh. Shit, you must be Wizdom.

728
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:10,241
- I am. And you are?

729
00:28:10,241 --> 00:28:11,261
- Oh, you ain't know?

730
00:28:11,261 --> 00:28:13,567
I'm Peaches. Nino's girl.

731
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:16,232
- Well, where is he?
Because we need to talk.

732
00:28:16,232 --> 00:28:17,301
- Talk about what?

733
00:28:17,301 --> 00:28:18,612
And how you even know my nigga?

734
00:28:18,612 --> 00:28:21,605
You need to be talking
to me about this shit.

735
00:28:21,605 --> 00:28:24,993
- Look, you must got me
confused with some ghetto bitch.

736
00:28:24,993 --> 00:28:27,360
I don't have time for
this low level bullshit.

737
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,992
Look, I did your man a favor.

738
00:28:28,992 --> 00:28:31,680
Which is evidently whatever
you can't do for him.

739
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,631
- What bitch?

740
00:28:32,631 --> 00:28:34,228
Bitch, who the fuck you think you is?

741
00:28:34,228 --> 00:28:35,949
Talking to me up in here like this?

742
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:38,224
Fuck you and this damn house!

743
00:28:38,224 --> 00:28:39,553
- [Wizdom] Well get the fuck out then!

744
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:41,333
- Yeah, fuck you and
this damn house, bitch!

745
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:44,254
(Peaches and Wizdom
arguing over each other)

746
00:28:44,254 --> 00:28:46,184
- Ay! Calm the fuck down.

747
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:47,254
- Fuck this shit!
- Calm the fuck down.

748
00:28:47,254 --> 00:28:48,193
- I don't know who the
fuck she think she is,

749
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,026
talking to me-

750
00:28:49,026 --> 00:28:51,431
- Whatever! Nino, can we talk?

751
00:28:51,431 --> 00:28:52,848
- Ay, give me a minute.

752
00:28:52,848 --> 00:28:54,515
- Nino, can we talk?

753
00:28:55,587 --> 00:28:56,654
- Just go.

754
00:28:56,654 --> 00:28:57,654
- Ham in it?

755
00:29:01,453 --> 00:29:02,438
- I hooked you up with this spot

756
00:29:02,438 --> 00:29:04,814
and you got this crazy hoe
in here trying to kill me.

757
00:29:04,814 --> 00:29:06,252
- She just jealous.

758
00:29:06,252 --> 00:29:07,711
Shit, she think I'ma leave her for you.

759
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:09,544
Look at all this shit.

760
00:29:10,753 --> 00:29:11,586
Ah, shit!

761
00:29:12,707 --> 00:29:14,086
- [Wizdom] How you holding up?

762
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,157
- I'm cool. I just gotta find out

763
00:29:15,157 --> 00:29:17,378
who got this bounty on my head.

764
00:29:17,378 --> 00:29:18,587
Then I'ma fuck them up

765
00:29:18,587 --> 00:29:21,122
and I'ma be back in the game.

766
00:29:21,122 --> 00:29:22,486
- Oh.

767
00:29:22,486 --> 00:29:23,558
Remember back in the day,

768
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:26,808
we used to sell weed out of Pacho's store?

769
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:28,391
- Yeah, shit.

770
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,349
He was cool back then.

771
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:31,961
All we had to do was just
throw the man a joint

772
00:29:31,961 --> 00:29:33,080
and we was good.

773
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,479
- [Wizdom] And I was gonna
blow up like Pablo Escobar.

774
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:36,485
- Shit you did, you know?

775
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:37,885
You out here balling and shit.

776
00:29:37,885 --> 00:29:40,372
Ain't nobody made it out
here like that but you.

777
00:29:40,372 --> 00:29:42,276
- Well I changed the way
that I'm playing the game,

778
00:29:42,276 --> 00:29:44,465
maybe it's time that you change
the way you playing it too?

779
00:29:44,465 --> 00:29:45,704
- Oh, shit. Well everybody can't just

780
00:29:45,704 --> 00:29:48,217
go marry no rich
motherfucker like yo husband

781
00:29:48,217 --> 00:29:51,769
and you know, Marry Poppins out the hood.

782
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:53,829
- Oh, is that what you'll think I did?

783
00:29:53,829 --> 00:29:55,239
You think I just fucked
my way to some money

784
00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:56,661
and said, "Fuck y'all?"

785
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:57,888
- Shit, look around.

786
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,393
This is a far way from

787
00:29:59,393 --> 00:30:01,059
rats and rubbers in the projects?

788
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:03,390
We still up in them motherfuckers.

789
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,987
- Look, I met my husband in
community collage, struggling.

790
00:30:06,987 --> 00:30:08,469
I was attracted to him
because for his ambition,

791
00:30:08,469 --> 00:30:09,615
not because of what he had,

792
00:30:09,615 --> 00:30:11,319
which was nothing, by the way.

793
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:13,335
He saw a poor girl
struggling from the hood

794
00:30:13,335 --> 00:30:15,174
and made her believe in herself.

795
00:30:15,174 --> 00:30:18,321
And everything that we
have, we built together.

796
00:30:18,321 --> 00:30:20,180
And I'm not judging you

797
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,687
and I gotta believe that you
called me here for a reason.

798
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,325
- I did but not for you
to bring me out here

799
00:30:24,325 --> 00:30:25,345
and give me a conversation

800
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:26,503
and turn me into a motherfucker,

801
00:30:26,503 --> 00:30:28,068
like your square ass husband.

802
00:30:28,068 --> 00:30:30,015
Shit, these motherfuckers owe me money.

803
00:30:30,015 --> 00:30:31,948
And I'm get that shit.

804
00:30:31,948 --> 00:30:33,781
- Look, I'm not trying
to change you, Nino.

805
00:30:33,781 --> 00:30:35,477
I just want you to be safe.

806
00:30:35,477 --> 00:30:37,114
(creepy music plays)

807
00:30:37,114 --> 00:30:38,912
- I'm cool. I got this.

808
00:30:38,912 --> 00:30:39,745
- All right.

809
00:30:39,745 --> 00:30:42,125
Well, my husband will be back in two weeks

810
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:44,597
and after that, we selling it. So...

811
00:30:44,597 --> 00:30:46,787
- Heard. That's all the time we need.

812
00:30:46,787 --> 00:30:49,954
(cars whooshing past)

813
00:30:51,044 --> 00:30:52,381
(bird chirping)

814
00:30:52,381 --> 00:30:53,214
- Here you go.

815
00:30:53,214 --> 00:30:54,419
- [Stephanie] Talk to me.

816
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,176
- Don't start Stephanie!

817
00:30:56,176 --> 00:30:57,883
- Don't start Stephanie?

818
00:30:57,883 --> 00:31:00,061
Is that all you have to say to me?

819
00:31:00,061 --> 00:31:01,824
I put my job in jeopardy

820
00:31:01,824 --> 00:31:03,232
getting you hired at the firm.

821
00:31:03,232 --> 00:31:05,870
And I tricked the board into
getting the drug exposed

822
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:08,445
by more tests, like you suggested.

823
00:31:08,445 --> 00:31:11,114
And now you're telling me it's missing?

824
00:31:11,114 --> 00:31:13,423
- It just wasn't acquired yet.

825
00:31:13,423 --> 00:31:15,802
- This was your plan, James.

826
00:31:15,802 --> 00:31:18,407
I was all ready, to put
it into the medication.

827
00:31:18,407 --> 00:31:21,501
This extra shit has got to stop!

828
00:31:21,501 --> 00:31:23,805
- It's the only way it's going to work.

829
00:31:23,805 --> 00:31:25,470
Trust me!

830
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,042
(water running)

831
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:27,875
- Fuck that shit!

832
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:29,861
I'm a kill them motherfuckers.

833
00:31:29,861 --> 00:31:32,591
- Nino. You got to get well first, right?

834
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:33,424
- [Nino] Man, fuck that shit.

835
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:34,293
I'm going back to that building,

836
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:35,428
getting my motherfucking money.

837
00:31:35,428 --> 00:31:37,780
- No the fuck you ain't
going back over there

838
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,306
to that damn building!

839
00:31:39,306 --> 00:31:40,775
- I'm going back to that motherfucker

840
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:42,112
and getting what's mine!

841
00:31:42,112 --> 00:31:43,709
- You ain't got to do shit.

842
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:44,729
Don't worry about it.

843
00:31:44,729 --> 00:31:46,031
I got it in the trunk baby.

844
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:47,239
- What?

845
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,375
How you do that shit?

846
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:51,180
- Well, I got Nino's drop off man.

847
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,013
- Come here.

848
00:31:52,013 --> 00:31:54,591
We drop the shit, you bring the money.

849
00:31:54,591 --> 00:31:55,753
- [Peaches] And I got him to tell me,

850
00:31:55,753 --> 00:31:59,670
where the fuck they might
be keeping yo ass at.

851
00:32:00,513 --> 00:32:03,411
(Gangsta slapping)

852
00:32:03,411 --> 00:32:04,244
- Nah, nah, nah.

853
00:32:04,244 --> 00:32:07,121
(tense music plays)

854
00:32:07,121 --> 00:32:09,802
- [Peaches] Nino, what the
fuck is wrong with you?

855
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,719
Damn. You acting crazy.

856
00:32:14,064 --> 00:32:15,646

857
00:32:15,646 --> 00:32:17,063

858
00:32:18,377 --> 00:32:19,978

00:32:19,978 --> 00:32:21,317

860
00:32:21,317 --> 00:32:22,192
(knocking on the door)

861
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:24,073
- Nigga beating in the door
like he the police or something.

862
00:32:24,073 --> 00:32:26,323
Who the fuck is that, dude.

863
00:32:28,334 --> 00:32:29,605
- What up with you King.

864
00:32:29,605 --> 00:32:31,688

- Come on brother.

869
00:32:37,395 --> 00:32:38,345
You do this shit every time.

870
00:32:38,345 --> 00:32:41,019
All right fool, all right.

871
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:41,852
Ay. What's happening with y'all?

00:32:41,852 --> 00:32:43,084

00:32:46,445 --> 00:32:48,842
(knocking on door)

875
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:49,834
- [Pimpin] Who the fuck is it?

876
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:50,749
- It's Little Hunk.

877
00:32:50,749 --> 00:32:52,799
- [Pimpin] Who?

878
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,691
Ay man, check yourself dammit.

879
00:32:54,691 --> 00:32:56,166
When I'm in here with my bitch,

880
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:58,133
and you hearing me checking
my bitch, my nigga,

881
00:32:58,133 --> 00:33:00,154
you have respect, my nigga.

882
00:33:00,154 --> 00:33:02,529
Now, I don't give a fuck who on the phone.

883
00:33:02,529 --> 00:33:04,405
If it's Jesus, tell him to call God

884
00:33:04,405 --> 00:33:05,601
and then have him call me.

885
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:07,265
You understand what I'm saying?

886
00:33:07,265 --> 00:33:08,834
That's on some pimping man.

887
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:09,891
Now I'ma holla at you in a second.

888
00:33:09,891 --> 00:33:11,104
Let me deal with this bitch right quick.

889
00:33:11,104 --> 00:33:12,676

890
00:33:12,676 --> 00:33:13,522
- [Pimpin] Ay bitch!

891
00:33:13,522 --> 00:33:16,071
This some real motherfucking
pimp shit, bitch.

892
00:33:16,071 --> 00:33:17,772

I'm sending myself bitch.

894
00:33:19,443 --> 00:33:22,132
I expect you to do what
I was supposed to do.

895
00:33:22,132 --> 00:33:23,581
It ain't no questions asked.

896
00:33:23,581 --> 00:33:26,178
Ain't no hoecializing, it
ain't none of that bitch.

897
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:28,510
You stump down on my motherfucking bread,

899
00:33:30,053 --> 00:33:31,897

and go do it again bitch.

901
00:33:33,695 --> 00:33:35,347
That's what a pimp do.

902
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,574
You understand what I'm saying?

903
00:33:36,574 --> 00:33:38,819
Now all that reckless
whoring you been doing bitch,

904
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:40,590

905

But right now bitch,

(phone vibrating)

1271
00:50:03,322 --> 00:50:04,155
- Hello?

1272
00:50:04,155 --> 00:50:05,196
(hip-hop music plays)
- [Dr Phil] My drug.

1273
00:50:05,196 --> 00:50:06,029
0713-C28,

1274
00:50:09,821 --> 00:50:11,238
I call it, "Joy."

1275
00:50:12,411 --> 00:50:14,978
It's specifically designed

1276
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:17,728
to cause self inflicted genocide.

1277
00:50:21,052 --> 00:50:24,972
- Okay. So you got the pills out the car?

1278
00:50:24,972 --> 00:50:26,222
Sell the pills.

1279
00:50:27,127 --> 00:50:29,521
Call your man and sell the pills.

1280
00:50:29,521 --> 00:50:30,354
- Sell the pills?

1281
00:50:30,354 --> 00:50:32,080
What you mean, "Sell the pills?"

1282
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,217
- Yeah. We gotta make a deal

1283
00:50:33,217 --> 00:50:34,434
'cause if we ain't gonna
do nothing with 'em

1284
00:50:34,434 --> 00:50:36,470
and you ain't gonna let me try one.

1285
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:38,862
- Man, the deal is done.

1286
00:50:38,862 --> 00:50:40,097
- The deal is done?

1287
00:50:40,097 --> 00:50:41,631
What you mean, "The deal done?"

1288
00:50:41,631 --> 00:50:42,464
- What you mean, "Make the deal?"

1289
00:50:42,464 --> 00:50:44,014
Deal is done.

1290
00:50:44,014 --> 00:50:45,264
- You got paid?

1291
00:50:46,926 --> 00:50:48,139
- What you think man?

1292
00:50:48,139 --> 00:50:50,154
I got $150,000.

1293
00:50:50,154 --> 00:50:51,071
- $150,000!

1294
00:50:52,651 --> 00:50:53,484
In cash?

1295
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:54,317
So it's in the car somewhere.

1296
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:55,187
You got cash?

1297
00:50:55,187 --> 00:50:56,495
'Cause you don't look like you got cash.

1298
00:50:56,495 --> 00:50:57,328
'Cause if you had cash,

1299
00:50:57,328 --> 00:50:58,161
I know you.

1300
00:50:58,161 --> 00:50:58,994
We'd be somewhere else.

1301
00:50:58,994 --> 00:51:00,898
Titties and bitches everywhere.

1302
00:51:00,898 --> 00:51:01,731
So you fell for that?

1303
00:51:01,731 --> 00:51:02,564
Put the money in the account,

1304
00:51:02,564 --> 00:51:03,745
James Bond shit?

1305
00:51:03,745 --> 00:51:05,510
You ever finished the James Bond movie?

1306
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:06,847
Delete, delete, delete.

1307
00:51:06,847 --> 00:51:07,680
Nigga's go to war

1308
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,347
'cause you don't get your money.

1309
00:51:12,824 --> 00:51:15,675
- What I look like to you? Huh?

1310
00:51:15,675 --> 00:51:19,594
Do I look like some type of
joke to you or something?

1311
00:51:19,594 --> 00:51:21,511
I mean, for real homie.

1312
00:51:22,676 --> 00:51:26,062
- If you ain't go do
the bag, can I try one?

1313
00:51:26,062 --> 00:51:30,562
'Cause 150,000 of them
motherfuckers gotta be hitting.

1314
00:51:31,725 --> 00:51:32,846
- I'm gonna call call my connect man,

1315
00:51:32,846 --> 00:51:35,451
'cause you like, really like...

1316
00:51:35,451 --> 00:51:36,306
I'm telling you man.

1317
00:51:36,306 --> 00:51:37,139
- I'm trying to make it work out

1318
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:39,997
the way it's supposed too.

1319
00:51:39,997 --> 00:51:40,953
- I'm getting sick of this man.

1320
00:51:40,953 --> 00:51:41,786
You're gonna have to start trusting me

1321
00:51:41,786 --> 00:51:44,173
or we gonna have to do
something else, man.

1322
00:51:44,173 --> 00:51:45,006
- We do something else?

1323
00:51:45,006 --> 00:51:47,665
We gonna start like, a logging company?

1324
00:51:47,665 --> 00:51:49,142
This is what we do.

1325
00:51:49,142 --> 00:51:50,780
- Hold on, man.

1326
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,844
- Damn.

1327
00:51:51,844 --> 00:51:54,098
All that money for just these.

1328
00:51:54,098 --> 00:51:55,861
- Ay. Give me the pills homie.

1329
00:51:55,861 --> 00:51:57,458
You think I'ma let you hold the pills.

1330
00:51:57,458 --> 00:52:00,235
- I wasn't gonna take
your damn pills, man.

1331
00:52:00,235 --> 00:52:01,707
It's your deal, remember?

1332
00:52:01,707 --> 00:52:02,957
This is my guy.

1333
00:52:06,116 --> 00:52:08,181
We gotta go to the back.

1334
00:52:08,181 --> 00:52:09,267
We gotta go to the back.

1335
00:52:09,267 --> 00:52:10,324
- What you mean?

1336
00:52:10,324 --> 00:52:11,157
- Come on, man. I forgot.

1337
00:52:11,157 --> 00:52:12,746
You can't even fuck around.

1338
00:52:12,746 --> 00:52:15,663
Mess around and get us both killed.

1339
00:52:19,221 --> 00:52:20,907
- Now look.

1340
00:52:20,907 --> 00:52:24,945
When we get in, just let
me do all the talking.

1341
00:52:24,945 --> 00:52:25,867
Do you.

1342
00:52:25,867 --> 00:52:27,700
Don't fuck nothing up.

1343
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:33,221
- Wait, where we at?

1344
00:52:33,221 --> 00:52:36,054
- Right over here. Nigga, come on.

1345
00:52:40,002 --> 00:52:41,606
Morph.

1346
00:52:41,606 --> 00:52:42,439
Morphine.

1347
00:52:48,712 --> 00:52:49,545
What's up?

1348
00:52:49,545 --> 00:52:50,378
- [AK] We cool?

1349
00:52:50,378 --> 00:52:51,211
- Yeah, we cool man.

1350
00:52:51,211 --> 00:52:53,961
Close the gate behind you though.

1351
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,142
This nigga testing, let's roll.

1352
00:53:05,074 --> 00:53:06,110
- Okay, I'ma need you to sign

1353
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:08,199
everywhere where it's been checked, okay?

1354
00:53:08,199 --> 00:53:09,032
- Damn sugar.

1355
00:53:09,032 --> 00:53:09,865
This shit is barely legal,

1356
00:53:09,865 --> 00:53:10,698

1357
00:53:10,698 --> 00:53:11,531
- Yeah, what the...

1358
00:53:11,531 --> 00:53:13,062
Nigga, if you want your shit to be sold

1359
00:53:13,062 --> 00:53:14,365
you need to sign this motherfucker

1360
00:53:14,365 --> 00:53:15,591
and sit the fuck down.

1361
00:53:15,591 --> 00:53:16,550
You understand?

1362
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:17,970
Sign it and give it back.

1363
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:19,803
I'm just saying. What?

1364
00:53:21,414 --> 00:53:22,610
Where the fuck you been?

1365
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:24,579
- What's up Roxy? Damn.

1366
00:53:24,579 --> 00:53:26,042
- What the fuck you want now?

1367
00:53:26,042 --> 00:53:29,703
- I don't want none of this shit but...

1368
00:53:29,703 --> 00:53:30,696
- What? What? What? What?

1369
00:53:30,696 --> 00:53:33,623
- I was just seeing if you
had Demerol left up in here?

1370
00:53:33,623 --> 00:53:35,206
- Can you read?

1371
00:53:35,206 --> 00:53:37,082
Clearly this is what we have.

1372
00:53:37,082 --> 00:53:37,942
- Where's Morphine at?

1373
00:53:37,942 --> 00:53:38,775
- He's at the back.

1374
00:53:38,775 --> 00:53:39,608
- Ayt, cool.

1375
00:53:39,608 --> 00:53:40,441
I'ma take this. 'Cause you don't need

1376
00:53:40,441 --> 00:53:41,824
no more God damn caffeine in yo system.

1377
00:53:41,824 --> 00:53:43,258
Come on.

1378
00:53:43,258 --> 00:53:45,269
- [Roxy] Bastard.

1379
00:53:45,269 --> 00:53:46,228
- Look at this shit.

1380
00:53:46,228 --> 00:53:47,061
What up Morph?

1381
00:53:47,061 --> 00:53:47,914
- What up Royal?

1382
00:53:47,914 --> 00:53:48,915
What's going on with you man?

1383
00:53:48,915 --> 00:53:49,748
- I'm good, I'm good.

1384
00:53:49,748 --> 00:53:51,394
I got some shit for you to look at.

1385
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,776
I'm talking about some real...

1386
00:53:53,776 --> 00:53:54,609
I got some shit.

1387
00:53:54,609 --> 00:53:56,127
- Ay. Who the fuck is this nigga?

1388
00:53:56,127 --> 00:53:57,794
- This is my cousin.

1389
00:54:03,002 --> 00:54:03,835
- What?

1390
00:54:03,835 --> 00:54:06,572
- I thought you said we was
going to some white folk.

1391
00:54:06,572 --> 00:54:10,699
- [Royal] Man, how many
white people do I know?

1392
00:54:10,699 --> 00:54:11,532
Give him the shit.

1393
00:54:11,532 --> 00:54:12,365
Give him the pills.

1394
00:54:12,365 --> 00:54:14,221
He got the pills in his pocket.

1395
00:54:14,221 --> 00:54:16,554
He can be real easy to lose.

1396
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:27,529
- Tell me what these are?

1397
00:54:27,529 --> 00:54:29,174
- [Morphine] Well, I
guess it ain't asprin.

1398
00:54:29,174 --> 00:54:30,051
- Hell nah it ain't asprin.

1399
00:54:30,051 --> 00:54:30,989
We got a white boy about to give us

1400
00:54:30,989 --> 00:54:32,675
a half a mil for that shit.

1401
00:54:32,675 --> 00:54:35,321
- About to give me a half a mil, nigga.

1402
00:54:35,321 --> 00:54:38,024
- Well, as for that
statement you made earlier.

1403
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:40,376
Hey, I just look like this.

1404
00:54:40,376 --> 00:54:43,401
But I'm intelligent than a motherfucker.

1405
00:54:43,401 --> 00:54:46,901
You see this number and bars on this pill?

1406
00:54:48,727 --> 00:54:51,169
That's a concentrated batch.

1407
00:54:51,169 --> 00:54:52,906
That's the original tester.

1408
00:54:52,906 --> 00:54:54,989
Before they microdose it.

1409
00:54:56,973 --> 00:54:59,058
Let me run some tests on this man.

1410
00:54:59,058 --> 00:55:01,829
Ay, you'll got some time to kick it?

1411
00:55:01,829 --> 00:55:04,246
- Hell yeah we got some time.

1412
00:55:05,479 --> 00:55:07,543
- Ay look. You gotta excuse me homie.

1413
00:55:07,543 --> 00:55:08,644
This is my thing.

1414
00:55:08,644 --> 00:55:09,824
- [Morphine] That's what's up.
- You know what I'm saying?

1415
00:55:09,824 --> 00:55:12,167
I got 150 racks about this.

1416
00:55:12,167 --> 00:55:13,500
- [Morphine] I get it man.

1417
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,003
- This nigga didn't get the 150 racks.

1418
00:55:15,003 --> 00:55:17,167
But, you know. Half a
mil is what we getting.

1419
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:18,000
- [Morphine] Well check it out.

1420
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,232
I make Morphine out of anything.

1421
00:55:20,232 --> 00:55:21,485
Gas and collard greens.

1422
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:22,318
- Well do your damn thing-

1423
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:23,151
- [Morphine] Let's see what it do.

1424
00:55:23,151 --> 00:55:25,392
- You need to put some
more windows in this bitch.

1425
00:55:25,392 --> 00:55:26,975
It's dark.

1426
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,818

(AK snoring)

1442
00:56:06,069 --> 00:56:07,649
- [Morphine] Ay, yay yay.

1443
00:56:07,649 --> 00:56:08,482
Let's get up.

1444
00:56:08,482 --> 00:56:10,649
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

1445
00:56:11,651 --> 00:56:12,484
- What's good, man?

1446
00:56:12,484 --> 00:56:14,188
- Ayo, so check it out.

1447
00:56:14,188 --> 00:56:16,232
Right now, I don't know
what's in this motherfucker

1448
00:56:16,232 --> 00:56:19,879
but what I do know, is that
it's a combination drug.

1449
00:56:19,879 --> 00:56:21,929
- [Royal] What?

1450
00:56:21,929 --> 00:56:25,161
- Well, it means it's got more
than one active ingredient.

1451
00:56:25,161 --> 00:56:28,306
I've done an ACU test,
I found two. So far.

1452
00:56:28,306 --> 00:56:32,331
Opium and there's also an
adrenaline inducer, okay?

1453
00:56:32,331 --> 00:56:33,759
I also found indicators

1454
00:56:33,759 --> 00:56:35,040
that navigate active ingredients

1455
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,693
to the receptors in the spine.

1456
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:37,819
- What?

1457
00:56:37,819 --> 00:56:39,973
- Do I look like Doogie Howser?

1458
00:56:39,973 --> 00:56:40,998
What the fuck are you talking about?

1459
00:56:40,998 --> 00:56:42,082
- Shut up, shut up man.

1460
00:56:42,082 --> 00:56:42,915
Go ahead, man.

1461
00:56:42,915 --> 00:56:43,748
Go ahead.

1462
00:56:43,748 --> 00:56:44,581
- [Morphine] So look.

1463
00:56:44,581 --> 00:56:46,484
Let me see how I'ma explain it to you'll.

1464
00:56:46,484 --> 00:56:47,977
So you know how you pop a Molly, right?

1465
00:56:47,977 --> 00:56:48,810
- Yeah.

1466
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:50,334
- [Morphine] It's gonna go
straight to your stomach,

1467
00:56:50,334 --> 00:56:54,250
to your liver, to your blood
stream, to your head, okay?

1468
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:57,615
Takes 20, 30 minutes to get you high.

1469
00:56:57,615 --> 00:56:59,238
Or you can shoot heroine.

1470
00:56:59,238 --> 00:57:01,959
It's gonna do straight
to your bloodstream,

1471
00:57:01,959 --> 00:57:04,094
get you high way faster.

1472
00:57:04,094 --> 00:57:08,014
The fastest way to do it? The spine. Okay?

1473
00:57:08,014 --> 00:57:10,338
Only way you gonna do that

1474
00:57:10,338 --> 00:57:13,054
is to get a shot directly in the spine.

1475
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:14,657
(Morphine clapping hands)
- [Morphine] Bam!

1476
00:57:14,657 --> 00:57:16,583
You take that pill?

1477
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:18,500
No shot needed. Booyah.

1478
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,313
- Okay.

1479
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,300
- You on yo A-game, man.

1480
00:57:26,358 --> 00:57:28,969
(AK clapping hands)
Let's get the money, baby.

1481
00:57:28,969 --> 00:57:30,579
- I told yo ass!

1482
00:57:30,579 --> 00:57:32,324
Didn't I tell you?

1483
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:34,818
Nigga, you my my nigga.

1484
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:35,651
- How much is it worth?

1485
00:57:35,651 --> 00:57:37,021
- How much is this shit worth?

1486
00:57:37,021 --> 00:57:38,708
- 'Bout 100K a pill.

1487
00:57:38,708 --> 00:57:40,101
- [Royal] 100K a pill?

1488
00:57:40,101 --> 00:57:41,641
You was about to give a whole bottle away

1489
00:57:41,641 --> 00:57:45,065
for 150 imaginary thousand dollars.

1490
00:57:45,065 --> 00:57:46,568
We getting paid!

1491
00:57:46,568 --> 00:57:48,263
- You gotta be fucked.

1492
00:57:48,263 --> 00:57:50,764
- [Morphine] Well it's the
actual genetic design of the pill

1493
00:57:50,764 --> 00:57:52,330
that's what makes it worth so much.

1494
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:53,535
- [Royal] Okay.

1495
00:57:53,535 --> 00:57:56,000
- I've never seen anything like it.

1496
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,664
Where you nigga's get these pills from?

1497
00:57:57,664 --> 00:57:59,584
- It's the plug, right here.

1498
00:57:59,584 --> 00:58:00,703
- You need to charge that nigga-

1499
00:58:00,703 --> 00:58:01,953
- Hold up, man.

1500
00:58:02,864 --> 00:58:03,697
- What's up?

1501
00:58:03,697 --> 00:58:05,030
- [Dr. Phil] You found my merchandise?

1502
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:07,613
- Look. The whole little thing,

1503
00:58:09,002 --> 00:58:11,075
everything is flipped now.

1504
00:58:11,075 --> 00:58:13,007
I want a million dollars homie.

1505
00:58:13,007 --> 00:58:14,903
- Yeah, what you do is do some pimp shit.

1506
00:58:14,903 --> 00:58:15,736
What you need to do

1507
00:58:15,736 --> 00:58:17,270
is make some coke and
weed bombs in this bitch.

1508
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:18,458
'Cause I was thinking about
bringing some hoes over here

1509
00:58:18,458 --> 00:58:19,801
but damn nigga.

1510
00:58:19,801 --> 00:58:21,378
You gon get me kicked out of Pimpedton.

1511
00:58:21,378 --> 00:58:22,329
- [Morphine] Well, I mean,

1512
00:58:22,329 --> 00:58:23,162
what I got going on over here man,

1513
00:58:23,162 --> 00:58:23,995
is I got a real-

1514
00:58:23,995 --> 00:58:27,347
- [Dr. Phil] What happened to
our agreed upon negotiation?

1515
00:58:27,347 --> 00:58:30,324
- Listen, I don't wanna hear none of that.

1516
00:58:30,324 --> 00:58:31,541
Fuck that.

1517
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:32,585
And you know what?

1518
00:58:32,585 --> 00:58:34,368
I want it all in cash too.

1519
00:58:34,368 --> 00:58:35,458
- [Dr. Phil] Well it's
gonna take some time

1520
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:36,868
to put that kind of money together.

1521
00:58:36,868 --> 00:58:38,639
- Because I know you're trying to work me,

1522
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:40,096
you know what I'm saying?

1523
00:58:40,096 --> 00:58:41,844
So, I already did my homework.

1524
00:58:41,844 --> 00:58:43,594
Matter of fact. Look.

1525
00:58:45,058 --> 00:58:46,500
Ain't no more talking.

1526
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,548
Get at me homie.

1527
00:58:47,548 --> 00:58:49,369
- [Dr. Phil] Let me see what I can do.

1528
00:58:49,369 --> 00:58:50,536
I'll call you.

1529
00:58:51,834 --> 00:58:53,815
- Until then, I got a
spot we can chill at.

1530
00:58:53,815 --> 00:58:55,663
Let's get the pills and let's go.

1531
00:58:55,663 --> 00:58:56,496
Ay, Morph.

1532
00:58:56,496 --> 00:58:58,983
Grab the pills, we gotta roll.

1533
00:58:58,983 --> 00:59:01,316
(AK oohing)

1534
00:59:03,124 --> 00:59:04,524
- You did something. Finally.

1535
00:59:04,524 --> 00:59:06,107
In yo fucking life.

1536
00:59:06,958 --> 00:59:09,035
Let's get some money man.

1537
00:59:09,035 --> 00:59:09,868
Let's get some money man.

1538
00:59:09,868 --> 00:59:11,174
- I got you.

1539
00:59:11,174 --> 00:59:14,736
- [Dr. Phil] I trusted
your gang of degenerates

1540
00:59:14,736 --> 00:59:15,736
with my drug

1541
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:18,166
and you've lost it?

1542
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:20,981
- I understand your frustration.

1543
00:59:20,981 --> 00:59:24,069
Just calm down and let's
work together on this.

1544
00:59:24,069 --> 00:59:26,986
- I'm not working with you on shit!

1545
00:59:28,009 --> 00:59:30,426
I'll go find the drug myself.

1546
00:59:32,706 --> 00:59:34,068
- What about the funding?

1547
00:59:34,068 --> 00:59:36,983
- I proved to you and Chicago

1548
00:59:36,983 --> 00:59:39,084
that that drugs works.

1549
00:59:39,084 --> 00:59:42,248
This whole L.A test was a waste of time.

1550
00:59:42,248 --> 00:59:44,623
You guys don't have the balls
to get down on the ground

1551
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:46,263
and do the testing.

1552
00:59:46,263 --> 00:59:47,872
- I take full responsibility

1553
00:59:47,872 --> 00:59:51,106
but I still need you to tell me

1554
00:59:51,106 --> 00:59:53,551
who is responsible for
delivering the drug?

1555
00:59:53,551 --> 00:59:54,814
- Watch it you twat!

1556
00:59:54,814 --> 00:59:57,564
I'm not working with you anymore.

1557
00:59:58,617 --> 01:00:00,470
- Listen you fucking freak.

1558
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:02,622
I can have your head cut off.

1559
01:00:02,622 --> 01:00:03,635
Do you hear me?

1560
01:00:03,635 --> 01:00:05,835
- Listen. I need some
time to find the drug.

1561
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:07,418
- You got 24 hours!

1562
01:00:08,268 --> 01:00:09,905
24 hours!

1563
01:00:09,905 --> 01:00:11,424
- That's enough.

1564
01:00:11,424 --> 01:00:13,591
But this is going nowhere.

1565
01:00:15,212 --> 01:00:17,528
- [[Stephanie] Fuck You!

1566
01:00:17,528 --> 01:00:19,314
(jar sliding across table)

1567
01:00:19,314 --> 01:00:20,196
- What's up my baby?

1568
01:00:20,196 --> 01:00:21,946
- What's up with you.

1569
01:00:23,586 --> 01:00:25,390
- Oh shit, I like the artillery.

1570
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:26,473
- [Nitty] You like that?

1571
01:00:26,473 --> 01:00:27,473
- Hell yeah.

1572
01:00:28,398 --> 01:00:30,996
We hurting some nigga's with this shit.

1573
01:00:30,996 --> 01:00:31,988
- [Nitty] That little nigga ain't playing.

1574
01:00:31,988 --> 01:00:33,797
Fuck a deer.

1575
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,006
We hunting some nigga's.

1576
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,310
- [Nitty] Yeah.

1577
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:37,401
- This shit is dope.

1578
01:00:37,401 --> 01:00:39,165
- You see that silencer, right?

1579
01:00:39,165 --> 01:00:40,550
(Goon imitating gun with silencer firing)

1580
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:42,027
- Yeah. Quiet work.

1581
01:00:42,027 --> 01:00:44,696
- You know what I was gonna ask you homie?

1582
01:00:44,696 --> 01:00:46,145
Man, whatever happened to that meet?

1583
01:00:46,145 --> 01:00:48,770
- Oh shit. Everything went good man.

1584
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:49,603
He was just like,

1585
01:00:49,603 --> 01:00:52,201
"Look. We gotta stop all the illegal shit

1586
01:00:52,201 --> 01:00:55,302
'cause we got some big,
big money coming in."

1587
01:00:55,302 --> 01:00:56,304
- [Nitty] Big money, huh?

1588
01:00:56,304 --> 01:00:58,221
- Yeah. Some big money.

1589
01:00:59,123 --> 01:01:01,461
- How much we talking about?

1590
01:01:01,461 --> 01:01:05,143
- Shit. He handed out
like, 2 million a piece

1591
01:01:05,143 --> 01:01:07,369
to like five of his boys.

1592
01:01:07,369 --> 01:01:09,797
Spread this out with you and your guys

1593
01:01:09,797 --> 01:01:12,130
and you'll lay off the illegal work

1594
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:15,055
and there's more money coming. Big money.

1595
01:01:15,055 --> 01:01:15,888
- 2 million, huh?

1596
01:01:15,888 --> 01:01:16,721
- 2 million.

1597
01:01:16,721 --> 01:01:18,639
- Nigga, 2 million ain't shit.

1598
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:20,179
2 million is not shit.

1599
01:01:20,179 --> 01:01:23,251
- Well shit. He had like
everybody's attention in there.

1600
01:01:23,251 --> 01:01:25,183
I mean, nigga's was glued on him.

1601
01:01:25,183 --> 01:01:27,024
I mean, he walked in

1602
01:01:27,024 --> 01:01:28,936
A black nigga too.

1603
01:01:28,936 --> 01:01:30,056
I'm talking, pssh.

1604
01:01:30,056 --> 01:01:31,887
Ain't nobody sat us down.

1605
01:01:31,887 --> 01:01:33,701
Came in the room.

1606
01:01:33,701 --> 01:01:34,696
I'm talking with bags.

1607
01:01:34,696 --> 01:01:36,034
He had real cash.

1608
01:01:36,034 --> 01:01:37,139
Bags of money.

1609
01:01:37,139 --> 01:01:38,729
And he just handing everybody bread

1610
01:01:38,729 --> 01:01:42,047
and we were looking at him like,

1611
01:01:42,047 --> 01:01:43,329
"This is what it is."

1612
01:01:43,329 --> 01:01:45,296
- See, that's how small nigga's think.

1613
01:01:45,296 --> 01:01:46,387
You feel what I'm saying?

1614
01:01:46,387 --> 01:01:48,227
That's small minded shit, my nigga.

1615
01:01:48,227 --> 01:01:50,097
Do you fucking know I've
been paying that family

1616
01:01:50,097 --> 01:01:51,428
for 20 years nigga?

1617
01:01:51,428 --> 01:01:52,261
- 20 years?

1618
01:01:52,261 --> 01:01:53,303
- You know how much money that is?

1619
01:01:53,303 --> 01:01:54,922
- So everything they was saying

1620
01:01:54,922 --> 01:01:57,601
in the meeting about the money was real?

1621
01:01:57,601 --> 01:01:59,173
That shit was real?

1622
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:00,143
- Real?

1623
01:02:00,143 --> 01:02:01,998
Let me tell you something homie.

1624
01:02:01,998 --> 01:02:03,721
Back in the 80's,

1625
01:02:03,721 --> 01:02:05,433
when the crack came,

1626
01:02:05,433 --> 01:02:06,604
everybody bro,

1627
01:02:06,604 --> 01:02:07,437
everybody,

1628
01:02:07,437 --> 01:02:08,984
the government, everybody,

1629
01:02:08,984 --> 01:02:11,307
was getting taxed 10%.

1630
01:02:11,307 --> 01:02:13,992
10%, all the drug dealers.

1631
01:02:13,992 --> 01:02:15,064
- Wow.

1632
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,203
- Do you know how much money that is?

1633
01:02:16,203 --> 01:02:18,247
- Gotta be stupid though.

1634
01:02:18,247 --> 01:02:19,988
- They got about a billion dollars homie.

1635
01:02:19,988 --> 01:02:22,894
They sitting on a billion dollars, homie.

and we gonna get some big, big kickbacks.

1640
01:02:31,042 --> 01:02:32,000
Big kickbacks.

1641
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,836
If we just chill on the illegal shit.

1642
01:02:35,836 --> 01:02:38,275
- Man, fuck that shit!

1643
01:02:38,275 --> 01:02:39,808
Fuck that shit!

1644
01:02:39,808 --> 01:02:41,027
I'm tired of these motherfuckers

1645
01:02:41,027 --> 01:02:43,327

1646
01:02:43,327 --> 01:02:44,826
Nigga, I've been paying them nigga's

01:02:44,826 --> 01:02:46,787
for a long ass time.

1648
01:02:46,787 --> 01:02:49,495
Man, I don't give a fuck
about none of that homie.

1649
01:02:49,495 --> 01:02:51,974
I don't give a fuck about none of that.

1650
01:02:51,974 --> 01:02:53,128
You feel me?

1651
01:02:53,128 --> 01:02:55,054
This is real shit.

1652
01:02:55,054 --> 01:02:56,054
Do you know?

1653
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:59,333
Do you even fucking know?

1654
01:03:04,054 --> 01:03:06,631
How long they gonna be in town my nigga?

1655
01:03:06,631 --> 01:03:07,716
- 'Till the end of the week.

1656
01:03:07,716 --> 01:03:09,102
He got some meetings.

1657
01:03:09,102 --> 01:03:10,515
After that, in New York.

1658
01:03:10,515 --> 01:03:12,090
He's supposed to meet up with these bosses

1659
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:13,707
from every borough and shit.

1660
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:14,540
- [Nitty] Is that right?

1661
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,477
So that means we still got some time then.

1662
01:03:16,477 --> 01:03:17,810
- So what's the plan?

1663
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:20,233
- So this gonna be the plan.

1664
01:03:20,233 --> 01:03:22,687
I'ma hook you up with the homie, right?

1665
01:03:22,687 --> 01:03:25,658
He gonna hook yo ass up with Mitchy.

1666
01:03:25,658 --> 01:03:27,493
You tell that motherfucker, homie,

1667
01:03:27,493 --> 01:03:30,236
I gotta have a motherfucking
sit down with him.

1668
01:03:30,236 --> 01:03:31,957
Fuck all this internet shit.

1669
01:03:31,957 --> 01:03:33,484
Fuck all that shit homie.

1670
01:03:33,484 --> 01:03:35,408
There's real money out here.

1671
01:03:35,408 --> 01:03:36,957
Do you know what's going on?

Nigga, 2 million ain't shit. Period.

1675
01:03:46,071 --> 01:03:47,589
We need some real money.

1676
01:03:47,589 --> 01:03:49,179
We need to have that fucking sit down.

1677
01:03:49,179 --> 01:03:51,602
You make sure you tell that motherfucker,

1678
01:03:51,602 --> 01:03:52,435

1679
01:03:52,435 --> 01:03:54,479

1681
01:03:55,312 --> 01:03:56,145
- Come through.

1682
01:03:56,145 --> 01:03:57,132
- We need way more than that. I got you.

1683
01:03:57,132 --> 01:03:58,140
Understood.

1684
01:03:58,140 --> 01:03:59,808
What's understood don't
gotta be explained.

1685
01:03:59,808 --> 01:04:00,641
I'll holla at you.

1686
01:04:00,641 --> 01:04:02,683
- Yeah. You already know what's up.

1687
01:04:02,683 --> 01:04:05,266
(door opening)

1688
01:04:06,498 --> 01:04:08,319
- What are you still doing up?

1689
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:09,272
You got school in the morning.

1690
01:04:09,272 --> 01:04:10,105
- Stop, stop, stop.

1691
01:04:10,105 --> 01:04:12,856
Dad. Do you still have a
sample of that fluid water?

1692
01:04:12,856 --> 01:04:15,642
- Yeah I do. But what's going on man?

1693
01:04:15,642 --> 01:04:16,475
What is it?

1694
01:04:16,475 --> 01:04:17,308
- See, look.

1695
01:04:17,308 --> 01:04:18,650
I'm looking into that pill you brought in.

1696
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:22,131
(electronic device chiming)

1697
01:04:22,131 --> 01:04:24,878
Look. The biomedical properties.

1698
01:04:24,878 --> 01:04:26,365
They're all over the place.

1699
01:04:26,365 --> 01:04:27,749
- Okay, yeah yeah.

1700
01:04:27,749 --> 01:04:29,514
I see, I see. Look.

1701
01:04:29,514 --> 01:04:30,347
Look's like right here

1702
01:04:30,347 --> 01:04:31,781
the active ingredient,

1703
01:04:31,781 --> 01:04:33,862
it's (indistinct).

1704
01:04:33,862 --> 01:04:35,161
- Nah, nah. You still not seeing it.

1705
01:04:35,161 --> 01:04:36,256
(Holographic interface chiming)

1706
01:04:36,256 --> 01:04:37,551
Look right here.

1707
01:04:37,551 --> 01:04:40,259
The cap in this opioid is
affecting the neuron connectors

1708
01:04:40,259 --> 01:04:42,424
in a way I've never even seen before.

1709
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:44,319
But right here.

1710
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:46,216
It forces the adrenaline to be pushed

1711
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:48,800
into the cones and the wires
in the back of the eye.

1712
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,836
You can only imagine the
level of paranoid images

1713
01:04:50,836 --> 01:04:51,982
this causes you to see.

1714
01:04:51,982 --> 01:04:54,504
(tense music begins)

1715
01:04:54,504 --> 01:04:57,171
(phone ringing)

1716
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:03,326
- What's up Big, it's Peaches.

1717
01:05:03,326 --> 01:05:04,591
- [Big] What's up girl, what's happening?

1718
01:05:04,591 --> 01:05:06,761
- Well look, I just
wanted you to find Nino,

1719
01:05:06,761 --> 01:05:08,323
I ain't want y'all to try and kill him.

1720
01:05:08,323 --> 01:05:09,268
What's up with that?

1721
01:05:09,268 --> 01:05:10,101
(Big laughing)

1722
01:05:10,101 --> 01:05:12,416
- Ay, I don't wanna even
do that nigga like that.

1723
01:05:12,416 --> 01:05:14,277
But he showed up hella
motherfucking disrespectful.

1724
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:15,664
My nigga's had to put him down.

1725
01:05:15,664 --> 01:05:17,749
- What nigga? How you know me nigga?

1726
01:05:17,749 --> 01:05:18,582
- I don't know you.

1727
01:05:18,582 --> 01:05:19,535
I know your bitch, nigga.

1728
01:05:19,535 --> 01:05:20,648
- What?

1729
01:05:20,648 --> 01:05:21,593
- Yeah. She said you was slipping

1730
01:05:21,593 --> 01:05:22,563
and you need some help.

1731
01:05:22,563 --> 01:05:25,589
- [Nino] Nigga, I don't
need your help for nothing!

1732
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:28,150
- Man.
(Goon punching Nino)

1733
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:30,077
- Ah, nigga. Ah nigga.

1734
01:05:30,077 --> 01:05:31,869
I'ma chop yo motherfucking head off

1735
01:05:31,869 --> 01:05:32,968
and roast it in the oven,

1736
01:05:32,968 --> 01:05:34,857
then I'ma strangle yo bitch ass nigga!

1737
01:05:34,857 --> 01:05:35,690
- What the fuck?

1738
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:37,107
- Nigga fuck you!

1739
01:05:38,271 --> 01:05:39,787
- Man, you lucky I owe your bitch a favor

1740
01:05:39,787 --> 01:05:41,870
or you'd be dead already.

1741
01:05:43,805 --> 01:05:46,555
- Take the trash out to the back.

1742
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:51,369
- Yeah, I found your boyfriend.

1743
01:05:51,369 --> 01:05:52,603
He ayt.

1744
01:05:52,603 --> 01:05:56,208
He's gonna need somebody
to pick his ass up.

1745
01:05:56,208 --> 01:05:59,476
- Well look, I'm trying to come see you.

1746
01:05:59,476 --> 01:06:00,309
Ayt.

1747
01:06:01,155 --> 01:06:02,482
- I don't know about all that shit, girl.

1748
01:06:02,482 --> 01:06:04,042
Every time a nigga fucks with you,

1749
01:06:04,042 --> 01:06:05,479
some bullshit always follows.

1750
01:06:05,479 --> 01:06:06,562
- [Peaches] Man, look Big.

1751
01:06:06,562 --> 01:06:07,862
Can't a bitch just wanna
be fucked real good

1752
01:06:07,862 --> 01:06:09,918
instead of getting into
all that extra shit?

1753
01:06:09,918 --> 01:06:10,751
Damn.

1754
01:06:10,751 --> 01:06:11,584
- That's all you want?

1755
01:06:11,584 --> 01:06:13,032
- You know what? Just fuck it.

1756
01:06:13,032 --> 01:06:14,553
Just don't even worry about it.

1757
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:18,553
- Ayt, ayt. I'ma text you

1758
01:06:24,489 --> 01:06:25,322

1759
01:06:26,624 --> 01:06:28,791
Kill that bitch ass nigga.

1760
01:06:30,005 --> 01:06:32,567
You love that nigga, don't you?

1761
01:06:32,567 --> 01:06:34,241
- Man, I don't give a
fuck about none of that.

1762
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:36,043
Fucking murder. I don't give a fuck.

1763
01:06:36,043 --> 01:06:37,161
I'm walking in this motherfucker.

1764
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:39,434
I'm killing babies, mommas, daddies.

1765
01:06:39,434 --> 01:06:40,624
You moving nigga?

1766
01:06:40,624 --> 01:06:41,457
We moving?

1767
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:43,967
- Come on man. Slow down man.

1768
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:44,800
You gotta slow down.

1769
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:45,676
We got too much to lose.

1770
01:06:45,676 --> 01:06:47,473
You just gotta go do what you need to do.

1771
01:06:47,473 --> 01:06:48,306
Listen to the new g's,

1772
01:06:48,306 --> 01:06:49,701
listen to the OG's, man.

1773
01:06:49,701 --> 01:06:50,721
Slow it down.

1774
01:06:50,721 --> 01:06:52,822
We're gonna get Big Murder, then Nitty.

1775
01:06:52,822 --> 01:06:54,312
Now, if you make a big scene outta this,

What's up man.

1780
01:06:58,254 --> 01:06:59,087
Come on Nino.

1781
01:06:59,087 --> 01:07:02,755

I need to talk to this nigga first.

1792
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:18,811
Don't kill him, don't kill his bitch.

1793
01:07:18,811 --> 01:07:19,644
Don't kill nobody.

1794
01:07:19,644 --> 01:07:20,477
If somebody popping off,

1795
01:07:20,477 --> 01:07:22,169
it's gonna be me.

1796
01:07:22,169 --> 01:07:23,002
- You can shoot, I shoot.

1797
01:07:23,002 --> 01:07:23,870
You already know.

1798
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:25,537

01:07:26,797 --> 01:07:29,531

01:07:31,081 --> 01:07:32,430

Ay, homie. Ay.

Silent. All right.

1806
01:07:37,722 --> 01:07:39,619
I can't believe the CEO or the president

1807
01:07:39,619 --> 01:07:42,697
of the fucking company called me up here.

1808
01:07:42,697 --> 01:07:44,514
Why you not showing up

01:07:59,113 --> 01:08:02,280
How much money have you put behind it?

1819

1820

(guns firing)

1830
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:49,560
(assault rifle firing)

1831
01:08:52,674 --> 01:08:55,473
(assault rifle firing)

1832
01:08:55,473 --> 01:08:58,723

1839
01:09:45,043 --> 01:09:45,876
(car doors slamming shut)

1840
01:09:45,876 --> 01:09:48,706
(car tires spinning against the gravel)

1841
01:09:48,706 --> 01:09:51,956
(assault rifle firing)

1842
01:09:55,178 --> 01:09:56,118
(assault rifle firing)

1843
01:09:56,118 --> 01:09:57,161

01:09:59,304 --> 01:10:02,721
(Nino breathing heavily)

1847
01:10:05,532 --> 01:10:07,490
- Ayo, Star. Make this

1848
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:09,540

1849
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:10,373

1850
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:11,338
Get yo ass up and make that run.

1851
01:10:11,338 --> 01:10:12,480
- [Star] Why can't Harry do it?

1852
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,594
- Take that nigga with you.

1853
01:10:13,594 --> 01:10:16,562
- Damn, every time I get to
chilling and everything...

1854
01:10:16,562 --> 01:10:17,470
Man, this is messed up.

1855
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:19,216
- I don't know why you keep
bumping them motherfucking gums.

1856
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:20,627
- [Stars] It's always
a money making mission,

1857
01:10:20,627 --> 01:10:23,640
so I ain't tripping anyway.

1858
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:24,637

1860
01:10:28,909 --> 01:10:29,742

1861
01:10:29,742 --> 01:10:30,575
- Ignorant ass nigga.

1862
01:10:30,575 --> 01:10:31,408
I'm telling you.

1863
01:10:31,408 --> 01:10:32,816
It was Freeway Rick Ross,

1864
01:10:32,816 --> 01:10:35,012
then The Cocaine Cowboys.

1865
01:10:35,012 --> 01:10:36,727
- Ah nigga, you forgetting
about the main nigga,

1866
01:10:36,727 --> 01:10:38,029
Waterhead.

1867
01:10:38,029 --> 01:10:40,446
- What the fuck is Waterhead?

1868
01:10:41,597 --> 01:10:44,295
- Man, Waterhead was like
a God to this shit man.

1869
01:10:44,295 --> 01:10:45,773
My pops, my uncle,

1870
01:10:45,773 --> 01:10:47,599
they used to run with that
nigga back in the day.

1871
01:10:47,599 --> 01:10:48,432
They used to tell me

1872
01:10:48,432 --> 01:10:49,826
about how they used to rent private jets,

1873
01:10:49,826 --> 01:10:51,961
to fly to Vegas, to sit court side,

1874
01:10:51,961 --> 01:10:55,245
ring side at the motherfucking
Sugar Ray fights.

1875
01:10:55,245 --> 01:10:56,545
Nigga, that was in '84.

1876
01:10:56,545 --> 01:10:59,401
Nigga's was like 23, 24. Balling.

1877
01:10:59,401 --> 01:11:00,234
- Balling.

1878
01:11:02,269 --> 01:11:03,102
- True story.

1879
01:11:03,102 --> 01:11:03,944
- I don't believe that shit.

1880
01:11:03,944 --> 01:11:04,777
- What?

1881
01:11:04,777 --> 01:11:06,429
- You can't forget about your boy, man.

1882
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:08,790
Come on man, Harry O.

1883
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:11,002
- Look man, they were my uncles man.

1884
01:11:11,002 --> 01:11:12,278
Michael, David.

1885
01:11:12,278 --> 01:11:13,111
And I'm telling you man.

1886
01:11:13,111 --> 01:11:15,573
They used to do finances
for that nigga Waterhead.

1887
01:11:15,573 --> 01:11:16,567
Na what I'm saying?

1888
01:11:16,567 --> 01:11:18,316
Let me put it like this.

1889
01:11:18,316 --> 01:11:20,710
Nigga, I was there when
Harry O put Mitch on.

1890
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:23,783
- Motherfucking fleas nigga.

1891
01:11:23,783 --> 01:11:24,783
Nigga, what?

1892
01:11:25,665 --> 01:11:26,834
That nigga didn't put that nigga Mitch on.

1893
01:11:26,834 --> 01:11:28,638
Mitch and his brother
came down from Detroit

1894
01:11:28,638 --> 01:11:30,950
and put themselves on, fool.

1895
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:31,783
- Nigga, how the fuck you think

1896
01:11:31,783 --> 01:11:33,223
that nigga Mitch got the game about

1897
01:11:33,223 --> 01:11:35,472
putting the dope in the
luxury vehicles, nigga?

1898
01:11:35,472 --> 01:11:37,732
Harry O had that shit
on lock since the 80's.

1899
01:11:37,732 --> 01:11:38,916
- I fuck with Harry 0.

1900
01:11:38,916 --> 01:11:41,115
That's where all these nigga's
got their swag from anyway.

1901
01:11:41,115 --> 01:11:42,492
- You God damn right.

1902
01:11:42,492 --> 01:11:43,843
I got so many stories for you'll nigga's,

1903

01:11:44,676 --> 01:11:47,686
Matter of fact, he the nigga

1905
01:11:47,686 --> 01:11:49,269
- He put Denzel on?

1906
01:11:53,174 --> 01:11:54,356
- [Big] Hell yeah.

1907
01:11:54,356 --> 01:11:55,356
- Man, you'll some dick riders.

1908
01:11:55,356 --> 01:11:57,708

01:11:57,708 --> 01:11:58,948
- Man, fuck Harry O.

1910
01:11:58,948 --> 01:12:00,906
