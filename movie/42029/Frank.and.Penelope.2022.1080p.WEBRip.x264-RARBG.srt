——跑出门去，“内洛普!”

那是纯粹的愤怒，
That was pure rage,

394

我不希望你为此感到抱歉
and I don't ever want you to be sorry about that.

395
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:40,208
因为如果一个男人不勃然大怒的话

那他就没有恋爱。

-“我开枪打了一个人。”

- [Frank画外音]以及和她在一起的全部经历
- [Frank Voiceover] And the sum total experience with her

400
00:20:55,495 --> 00:20:59,695
简直就是《管制药物法案》
is nothing short of the Controlled Substances Act.

401
00:21:00,462 --> 00:21:02,129
但那人活该
But that man deserved it,

402
00:21:02,165 --> 00:21:03,600
我开枪打了他
and I shot him.

403
00:21:10,072 --> 00:21:11,778
-嗨。
- Hey.

404
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,377
如果我告诉你

我不想再当猎枪了?
I don't wanna be no shotgun no more?

406
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,185
-你他妈在说什么，内洛普?
- The fuck you talking about, 'Nelope?

407
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:23,788
-也许我想要升级，宝贝
- Well maybe I want an upgrade, baby.

408
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,083
不骑就死。
To ride or die.

409
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,091
-该死的，女孩，这完全没有道理，
- God damn it, girl, that makes no fucking sense at all,

410
00:21:30,127 --> 00:21:31,663
但我喜欢它!
but I love it!

411
00:21:31,698 --> 00:21:32,530
完成了!
Done!

412
00:21:33,498 --> 00:21:35,835
-那我们还应该做什么疯狂的事?
- So what other crazy thing should we do?

413
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,634
像鞭策时刻。
Spur the moment like.

414
00:21:40,434 --> 00:21:43,574
(轮胎尖叫)
(tires screeching)

415
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,015
-就算换了普锐斯
- Even with the Prius trade in,

416
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,714
那我们就快破产了。
that'll leave us almost broke.

417
00:21:52,749 --> 00:21:54,848
-我不在乎你得到了什么，弗兰克
- Well, I don't care about what you got, Frank.

418
00:21:54,884 --> 00:21:58,956
我只关心你能得到什么。
I only care about what you're capable of getting.

00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,422
(官笑)
(Officer chuckles)

610
00:34:45,457 --> 00:34:50,222
-我不知道，亲爱的，很难打败一个68b的人，但是，
- I don't know, sweetie, it's hard to beat a 68 B, but uh,

611
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:52,296
该死，还喜欢车。
damn, likes cars, too.

612
00:34:54,033 --> 00:34:56,163
你这招不错，小子。
Got yourself a good one there, son.

613
00:34:56,198 --> 00:34:58,063
-拜托，他什么都没有。
- Please, he ain't got shit.

614
00:34:58,099 --> 00:34:59,164
他是我哥哥。
He's my brother.

615
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,097
-是吗?
- Oh, is that right?

616
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:01,538
-嗯嗯。
- Mm-hm.

617
00:35:01,573 --> 00:35:02,405
——好。
- Well.

618
00:35:04,305 --> 00:35:06,038
那下面是什么?
So what you got under there?

619
00:35:06,073 --> 00:35:07,278
——内衣。
- Underwear.

620
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,814
只是kiddin”。
Just kiddin'.

621
00:35:09,849 --> 00:35:13,244
这是V8引擎，而且他妈的很大。
It's a V8, fuckin' big one, too.

622
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:14,714
-我打赌是的。
- I'll bet it is.

623
00:35:17,518 --> 00:35:19,252
那又怎样，你要保密吗?
So what, you gonna keep it a secret?

624
00:35:19,287 --> 00:35:21,387
-你知道他们怎么说吗
- Well, you know what they say,

625
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:22,753
这是一个永远不会说出口的秘密
it's the secret that's never told

626
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:26,797
这提供了最非凡的悬念。
that offers the most extraordinary suspense.

627
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,060
-是啊，这个不错。
- Yeah, that's a good one.

628
00:35:28,096 --> 00:35:29,298
谁说的?
Who said that?

629
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,263
-告诉他这是唐·大蒜老爸送的
- Tell him it's from Big Daddy Don Garlic.

630
00:35:30,298 --> 00:35:32,569
-大佬丹·大蒜。
- Fucking Big Daddy Dan Garlic.

631
00:35:32,604 --> 00:35:33,397
- - - - - -唐。
- Don.

632
00:35:33,432 --> 00:35:34,233
-我就是这个意思
- That's what I meant.

633
00:35:34,268 --> 00:35:35,202
Garlets。- - - - - -唐。
- It's Garlets. - Don.

634
00:35:35,237 --> 00:35:36,573
-我相信他最后一次是-
- And I believe his last was-

635
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:37,703
——Garlets。
- Garlets.

636
00:35:37,772 --> 00:35:40,612
-哦，是啊，他是个很棒的踏板车司机，不是吗?
- Oh yeah, he was a hell of mopar driver, wasn't he?

637
00:35:40,648 --> 00:35:41,573
-当然了
- Sure as hell was.

638
00:35:41,675 --> 00:35:43,507
我喜欢他开拖把的样子。
Hell, I love the way he drove them mopers.

639
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:45,881
是他开的，没错。
He fuckin' owns 'em, he does.

640
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:47,582
-嘿，亲爱的，
- Hey, look honey,

641
00:35:48,685 --> 00:35:53,022
你回来的路上有什么想炫耀的吗，
you got anything you wanna show off on the way back in,

642
00:35:53,057 --> 00:35:55,292
你只要喊我一声，听到了吗?
you just gimme a holler, hear?

643
00:35:55,328 --> 00:35:59,528
-你最好留心听，好兄弟。
- Well you better keep your ears on, good buddy.

644
00:36:00,933 --> 00:36:02,264
-(清了清嗓子)好吧，不管怎样，
- (clears throat) Well, anyway,

645
00:36:02,299 --> 00:36:04,235
我让你们靠边停车的真正原因
the real reason I pulled y'all over

646
00:36:04,271 --> 00:36:06,804
你要去30英里的地方吗
is you're about to hit a stretch of about 30 miles

647
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,337
没有手机信号塔，
with no cell phone towers,

648
00:36:08,372 --> 00:36:11,406
之后还有40英里没油了。
and no gas for another 40 miles after that.

649
00:36:11,441 --> 00:36:14,445
你最好盯紧那个标尺。
You may wanna keep a close eye on that gauge.

650
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,509
我是说，在水银街12英里处就能买到汽油，
I mean, you can get gas in Quicksilver about 12 miles in,

651
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:21,448
但快进去，快离开那里。
but get in and get outta there.

652
00:36:21,484 --> 00:36:23,552
水银掉进了矿井的水里
Mercury got in the water from that mine

653
00:36:23,588 --> 00:36:27,088
把阿巴拉契亚移植手术留给他们，真是疯了。
and left them Appalachian transplants bat shit crazy.

654
00:36:27,123 --> 00:36:29,327
他们还剩下什么。
What's left 'em, anyway.

655
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:32,957
我不想耽误你们的时间。
Well, I don't wanna keep y'all.

656
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,067
你让她开过那玩意吗?
Hey, you ever let her drive that thing?

657
00:36:39,102 --> 00:36:40,599
-偶尔会。
- Every once in a while.

658
00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:43,204
-因为我喜欢看美女
- 'Cause I would love to see a beauty

659
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:44,675
在美丽的车轮后面。
behind the wheel of the beauty.

660
00:36:44,711 --> 00:36:45,709
(枪击发)
(gun cocking)

661
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,544
那是什么?
What was that?

662
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,945
——板球。
- Cricket.

663
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,243
该死的东西被困在这里了
Damn things been caught in here

664
00:36:49,278 --> 00:36:51,515
因为我们在马拉松加油了。
since we got gas in Marathon.

665
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,817
是的，我只让他在我需要午睡的时候开车。
And yeah, I only let him drive when I need to take a nap.

666
00:36:53,853 --> 00:36:55,650
让我们开关,汤米。
Let's switch, Tommy.

667
00:37:02,494 --> 00:37:06,226
-如果你们想在离开这里的路上把他们抽了
- If y'all wanna smoke 'em up on the way outta here,

668
00:37:06,261 --> 00:37:07,891
不是没人看。
ain't nobody looking.

669
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:10,597
你不会从我这里看到任何浆果和樱桃。
You won't see no berries and cherries from me.

670
00:37:10,633 --> 00:37:14,900
-好吧，我让你坐在前排，伙计。
- Well, I'm a give you a front row seat, law man.

671
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:19,238
(欢快的音乐)(发动机转动)
(lively music) (engine revving)

672
00:37:19,273 --> 00:37:22,314
(轮胎啸声)
(tires squealing)

673
00:37:37,863 --> 00:37:41,491
(玛格达呜咽)
(Magda whimpering)

674
00:37:41,527 --> 00:37:43,030
-就这样了
- Well, this is it.

675
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:44,595
它,它的谦逊。
It, it's humble.

676
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,001
但是房间很干净。
But rooms are clean though.

677
00:37:47,037 --> 00:37:48,505
我，我确定。
I, I make sure.

678
00:37:49,473 --> 00:37:52,608
办公室就在右边。
The, the office is there on the right.

679
00:37:54,077 --> 00:37:57,008
(玛格达呜咽)
(Magda whimpering)

680
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:25,575
(紧张的音乐)
(tense music)

(紧张的音乐)
(tense music)

683
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,505
-嗨，爸爸，我是莫莉。
- Hi daddy, it's Molly.

684
00:38:55,572 --> 00:38:59,070
我是从汽车旅馆打来的，因为
Um, I'm calling from a motel phone 'cause,

685
00:39:00,247 --> 00:39:03,613
因为我在16号公路的死角上。
'cause I'm on that dead spot on the 16.

686
00:39:04,614 --> 00:39:07,881
我知道，我很抱歉，但是，听着。
And I know, I'm sorry, but, but listen.

687
00:39:10,253 --> 00:39:11,584
(聊天)
(people chattering)

688
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,858
-[女人]我喜欢你。

喜欢你。(咯咯笑)
Like you. (giggling)

了解更多我不喜欢的你。
Find out a lot more about you than I like.

693
00:39:21,461 --> 00:39:22,797

00:39:24,435 --> 00:39:25,630
-总之，我希望你能尽快收到这封信

所以你可以来接我。

00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:28,803
是的。
Yeah.

697
00:39:30,974 --> 00:39:31,836
好吧。
Okay.

698
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:34,941
希望明早能见到你。
Hopefully I see you in the morning.

699
00:39:36,447 --> 00:39:37,812
我爱你，爸爸。(紧张的音乐)
I love you, daddy. (tense music)

700
00:39:37,847 --> 00:39:42,553
-我不记得你要求使用任何额外服务。
- Didn't recall you asking to use any extra services.

701
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,589
-哦，我很抱歉。
- Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.

702
00:39:46,356 --> 00:39:48,424
我只是打了个电话。
I just had to make a quick call.

703
00:39:48,459 --> 00:39:51,760
不过你可以加到我的账单上。
Um, you can add it to my bill though.

704
00:39:53,698 --> 00:39:57,969
-这取决于我，我不会收你钱的。
- It was up to me, I, I wouldn't charge you at all.

705
00:39:58,005 --> 00:39:59,867
嗯，我最喜欢5个。
Well, five's my favorite.

706
00:40:00,801 --> 00:40:04,501
只是它总是闻起来很香。

00:40:04,537 --> 00:40:06,109

我不知道你有客人。

你离开了你的丈夫
you left your husband

751

还有，小劳里才三岁。
And, (cries) little Laurie was three.

758

00:52:18,974 --> 00:52:21,575
(可怕的音乐)
(eerie music)

909
00:52:24,614 --> 00:52:27,750
-奇索斯说，大多数人会接受双重谎言
- Chisos says most people take double helpings of a lie

910
00:52:27,785 --> 00:52:29,647
如果味道好。
if it tastes good.

911
00:52:29,683 --> 00:52:32,588
给狗狗们留下一盘健康的真相。
Leave a healthy plate of truth out for the dogs.

912
00:52:32,624 --> 00:52:33,455
——不是我。
- Not me.

913
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:38,125
-是的，我想这取决于你对谁有罪。
- Yeah, I guess it depends on who you're sinning against.

914
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,689
-智索的话语不会说谎，孩子。
- Chisos words don't lie, child.

915
00:52:39,724 --> 00:52:42,926
-等等，谁是芝士酱?
- Wait a minute, who's Cheese Sauce?

916
00:52:43,801 --> 00:52:44,961
Chisos。
- It's Chisos.

917
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:49,101
没有什么比不从他嘴里说出来更强大的了。
Ain't nothing more powerful than won't come outta his mouth.

918
00:52:49,137 --> 00:52:50,505
我看到了他的话
And I seen his words

919
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:53,569
让一列尖叫的货运列车完全停下来。
bring a screaming freight train to a complete stop.

920
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:56,647
-你是说真的火车吗?
- You mean like an actual train?

921
00:52:56,683 --> 00:52:57,674
-像小火车?
- Like a choo choo?

922
00:52:57,709 --> 00:53:00,549
-是的，亲爱的，一辆真正的火车。
- Yes, darling, an actual choo choo.

923
00:53:00,584 --> 00:53:02,782
他是从楼上餐厅的前窗下手的。
He done it from the front window in the diner upstairs.

924
00:53:02,817 --> 00:53:05,584
一群怀疑者听到了Butte的Stud线的到来。
A bunch of doubters heard the Stud of Butte line coming.

925
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:09,491
他站起来，像这样伸出双手，
He rose up and held out his hands like this,

926
00:53:10,755 --> 00:53:12,723
说了几句盖尔语。
said a few of those Gaelic words.

927
00:53:12,758 --> 00:53:15,593
几英里外就能听到刹车声。
You could hear those brakes from miles away.

928
00:53:15,628 --> 00:53:18,632
36辆车全部停了下来。
All 36 cars come to a complete stop.

929
00:53:19,567 --> 00:53:22,369
再多说几句，他就把话说回来了。
Few more words, he even made it back up.

930
00:53:22,405 --> 00:53:23,871
-你确定不是偏离轨道了?
- You sure it wasn't just side tracked?

931
00:53:23,907 --> 00:53:24,874
(铃铛叮当声)
(bells jingling)

932
00:53:24,909 --> 00:53:26,805
-那是侧道。
- It was side tracking.

933
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:31,714
你们俩肯定见过车是怎么被撞的。
I'm sure you two have seen it done to a car.

934
00:53:31,749 --> 00:53:32,608
我说的对吗?
Am I right?

935
00:53:32,643 --> 00:53:34,410
-我看你把它开起来了，是吧?
- I see you got it running, huh?

936
00:53:34,446 --> 00:53:36,318
-只是保险丝。
- It's just a fuse.

937
00:53:36,353 --> 00:53:37,953
我只是用中指挠了一下痒
Just a little tickle with my middle finger

938
00:53:37,988 --> 00:53:39,818
它马上就火了。
and it fired right up.

939
00:53:42,326 --> 00:53:45,863
-天啊，宝贝，你听到了吗?
- Oh my God, baby, did you just hear that?

940
00:53:45,898 --> 00:53:47,461
在远处的某个地方
Somewhere off in the distance

941
00:53:47,496 --> 00:53:51,269
一辆货运火车掉头了。
a freight train just made a fucking U-turn.

942
00:53:51,935 --> 00:53:53,670
(笑着说)
(people laughing)

943
00:53:53,706 --> 00:53:54,704
——我Chisos。
- I'm Chisos.

944
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:56,067
-哦，我是弗兰克。
- Oh, I'm Frank.

945
00:53:56,102 --> 00:53:56,901
- - -弗兰克。
- Frank.

946
00:53:58,108 --> 00:54:00,611
嘿，你们俩是度蜜月的。
Hey, you two are honeymooners.

947
00:54:00,647 --> 00:54:01,240
是这样吗?
Is that right?

948
00:54:01,275 --> 00:54:02,846
-对，没错。
- Yeah, that's right.

949
00:54:02,881 --> 00:54:03,940
我们有您的特大号
We got your king size

950
00:54:03,975 --> 00:54:06,575
后面还有花床头板和其他东西。
with the flower back headboard and everything.

951
00:54:06,611 --> 00:54:08,577
我们尽量不吵醒你。
We'll try not to wake you.

952
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:10,354
-你知道他们怎么说吗
- You know what they say,

953
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:13,385
你在真相出来前5天撒了谎，
you throw a lie in a river five days before the truth,

954
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,123
真相迟早会大白的
the truth is gonna catch up.

955
00:54:15,158 --> 00:54:18,195
-尤其是在这张桌子上。
- Especially at this table.

956
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:21,297
-大多数人都是无缘无故逃出来的
- Most don't make it out here without a reason.

957
00:54:21,332 --> 00:54:24,333
因为我们不走寻常路。
Being that we're off the beaten path and all.

958
00:54:24,369 --> 00:54:27,500
告诉我，你们这对新婚夫妇要去哪里?
So tell me, where are you newly weds headed?

959
00:54:27,535 --> 00:54:29,774
-你看，作为结婚礼物
- Well, see, as a, as a wedding gift,

960
00:54:29,809 --> 00:54:30,534
我的新丈夫，是的，
my new husband, yeah,

961
00:54:30,569 --> 00:54:31,769
他答应要扳倒我
he's promised to take me down

962
00:54:31,804 --> 00:54:33,776
这是世界上最美的路。
the prettiest road in the whole fuckin' world.

963
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:34,738
-好吧，你-
- Oh well, you-

964
00:54:34,774 --> 00:54:35,880
-这个世界不该来这里
- Well this is the wrong part of the world

965
00:54:35,915 --> 00:54:38,115
去寻找最美丽的道路。
to find the prettiest road.

966
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,342
-是啊，不是在这个臭地方
- Yeah, it ain't in this stink hole.

967
00:54:40,378 --> 00:54:41,748
这是西方。
It's west.

968
00:54:41,783 --> 00:54:44,547
我的宝贝，他说他在电影里看到的，
My baby here, he said that he saw it in some movie,

969
00:54:44,582 --> 00:54:46,517
《末路狂花》。"
uh, "Thelma & Louise."

970
00:54:46,552 --> 00:54:48,056
他们走的就是这条路
It's this road that they go down

971
00:54:48,091 --> 00:54:49,524
在电影的结尾，
at the end of the movie,

972
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:53,564
还有我的宝贝，他要带我去兜风。
and my baby here, he's gonna take me for a ride.

973
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:54,431
——哇。
- Wow.

974
00:54:55,399 --> 00:54:58,297
你是一个多么慷慨善良的人啊。
What a generous and kind man you are.

975
00:54:58,332 --> 00:55:00,637
我看过那部电影。
I've seen that movie.

976
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:01,934
很神奇的。
Amazing.

977
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:06,938
看到一对情侣要带对方去兜风。
To see two love birds about to take each other for a ride.

978
00:55:07,947 --> 00:55:10,508
我能和你们一起去吗?
You mind if I join you two?

979
00:55:10,543 --> 00:55:12,481
-除非你有故事。
- Well only if you have a story.

980
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:15,279
你知道的，因为这是规则。
You know, seeing as how that's the rules and all.

981
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:16,512
-给我们两个。
- Get us two.

982
00:55:16,547 --> 00:55:17,788
-就两个?
- Just, just two?

983
00:55:17,823 --> 00:55:19,217
-只为我们男人。
- Just for us men.

984
00:55:19,253 --> 00:55:20,523
-[梅布尔]哦。
- [Mabel] Oh.

985
00:55:21,457 --> 00:55:24,588
-那么，呃，你在这里做什么?
- So uh, what is it you do out here?

986
00:55:24,623 --> 00:55:26,494
-简而言之，
- But the short version though,

987
00:55:26,529 --> 00:55:29,628
因为我已经准备好做床头板了。
'cause I'm about ready for that headboard.

988
00:55:29,663 --> 00:55:32,265
-真相不能被删减。
- Well the truth can't be truncated.

989
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,130
-那就尽力吧。
- Well, try your best.

990
00:55:36,304 --> 00:55:38,308
-克利夫斯怎么样?
- How's this for Cliffs?

991
00:55:38,343 --> 00:55:41,707
他们一家1903年从阿巴拉契亚出来。
Family came out from Appalachia in 1903.

992
00:55:41,742 --> 00:55:43,742
这个矿井是我家祖祖辈辈传下来的。
This mine's been in my family for generations.

993
00:55:43,777 --> 00:55:46,851
我们曾是世界水银之都，
We were the mercury capital of the world,

994
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:48,649
直到矿井坍塌。
till the mine collapsed.

995
00:55:48,685 --> 00:55:50,983
我祖父被困在矿井下。
My grandfather was trapped underneath that mine.

996
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:54,585
他领导了一个释放杀人犯的监狱工作计划，
He was leading a prison work release program for murderers,

997
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:57,555
强奸犯，各种污秽。
rapists, all kinds of filth.

998
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,857
他们被留在那里等死，
They were left there for dead,

999
00:55:59,892 --> 00:56:02,229
直到11天后他走了出来
until he came walking out 11 days later

1000
00:56:02,264 --> 00:56:03,628
当板块移动时。
when the plate shifted.

1001
00:56:03,664 --> 00:56:04,995
他是唯一一个活下来的。
He was the only one that made it.

1002
00:56:05,031 --> 00:56:09,506
三个重罪犯死在下面，被咬得只剩骨头。
Three dead felons left below, gnawed to the bone.

1003
00:56:10,535 --> 00:56:12,071
——这是疯了。
- That's crazy.

1004
00:56:12,106 --> 00:56:16,340
-看我祖父他靠吃罪人活下来
- See my grandfather, he survived by eating those sinners,

1005
00:56:16,376 --> 00:56:17,811
器官。
organs and all.

1006
00:56:19,016 --> 00:56:20,644
不是一个秘密。
Not a secret.

1007
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:22,714
到处都是报纸。
Made the papers everywhere.

1008
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:25,486
什么是秘密，我们还在
What is a secret is that we are still

1009
00:56:25,521 --> 00:56:28,322
阿巴拉契亚的食罪者是我们的核心。
Appalachian sin eaters at our core.

1010
00:56:28,357 --> 00:56:29,519
几个世纪以来我们一直如此。
We have been for centuries.

1011
00:56:29,554 --> 00:56:30,989
它流淌在我们的血液里。
It's in our blood.

1012
00:56:31,024 --> 00:56:34,124
所以所有的流浪者，旅行者，所有的奔跑者，
So all the drifters, the travelers, all the runners,

1013
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,569
他们来到这里，坐在这张桌子前忏悔，
they come and sit down here at this table and confess,

1014
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:41,635
我们的消耗与罪的严重程度成正比。
and we consume in proportion to the severity of the sin.

1015
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:44,769
有时候只是耳朵后面的BB。
Sometimes it's just a BB behind the ear.

1016
00:56:44,805 --> 00:56:48,308
有时是无法生存的菲力牛排
Sometimes it's an unsurvivable filet,

1017
00:56:48,344 --> 00:56:50,540
够六个人吃的。
enough for a table of six.

1018
00:56:50,575 --> 00:56:52,011
-他在干什么?
- What's he doing?

1019
00:56:52,046 --> 00:56:54,749
-当他不让他们离开时，他总是这样做。
- What he always does when he ain't gonna let 'em leave.

1020
00:56:54,784 --> 00:56:56,851
给他们灌输一个难以置信的真相。
Fills them with a truth that's too hard to believe.

1021
00:56:56,886 --> 00:57:00,354
-我们把手机带到华雷斯，然后扔掉
- We take the cell phones down the Juarez, we dump 'em.

1022
00:57:00,389 --> 00:57:03,054
我们把尸体和车都烧了。
We burn the bodies and the cars.

1023
00:57:04,494 --> 00:57:06,161
没人知道是我们干的
No one has any idea that it is us

1024
00:57:06,196 --> 00:57:07,364
这就承担了负担
that takes on the burden

1025
00:57:07,399 --> 00:57:10,399
否则世界将不得不承受。
that the world would otherwise have to carry.

1026
00:57:10,434 --> 00:57:12,201
我有同样的机会犯错，
I'm equal opportunity to at fault,

1027
00:57:12,236 --> 00:57:14,868
即使是我自己。
even when it comes to myself.

1028
00:57:15,836 --> 00:57:19,235
有时我尝到了自己罪恶的滋味。
Sometimes I consume a taste of my own sin.

1029
00:57:20,474 --> 00:57:22,077
——啊。——耶稣基督。
- Ugh. - Jesus Christ.

1030
00:57:22,113 --> 00:57:23,877
-我开玩笑的。
- I'm just kidding.

1031
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:28,750
但是火车的部分，是真的。
But the train part, that's true.

1032
00:57:29,614 --> 00:57:31,115
在一角钱上随心所欲。
At will on a dime.

1033
00:57:32,489 --> 00:57:33,924
而且不是无生命的火车头。
And just not inanimate locomotives.

1034
00:57:33,959 --> 00:57:35,418
-比如什么?
- Like what else?

1035
00:57:35,454 --> 00:57:36,588
——人。
- People.

1036
00:57:36,623 --> 00:57:37,822
我知道所有的动机，
I know all about incentives,

1037
00:57:37,857 --> 00:57:41,094
动机和整体心理学。
motivations and overall psychology.

1038
00:57:41,129 --> 00:57:41,961
——好的。
- Okay.

1039
00:57:43,364 --> 00:57:44,766
试着我,弗洛伊德。
Try me, Freud.

1040
00:57:48,904 --> 00:57:53,341
-我的家族拥有6000多英亩的土地
- My family owned over 6,000 mercury rich acres,

1041
00:57:53,376 --> 00:57:55,040
但现在只剩我一个人了
but now I'm the only one left.

1042
00:57:55,076 --> 00:57:59,913
去年4月，我以2400万美元的价格卖掉了几乎所有的房子。
So last April, I sold almost all of it for $24 million.

1043
00:58:02,816 --> 00:58:05,352
现在我没人可以花钱了。
Now I have no one to spend it on.

1044
00:58:05,388 --> 00:58:07,790
没人给我生孩子。
No one to give me a child.

1045
00:58:07,825 --> 00:58:11,992
我真的想要一个，不仅仅是因为遗产的原因。
And I really want one, for more than just legacy reasons.

1046
00:58:12,027 --> 00:58:15,527
山顶上那间不起眼的小房子，
That modest little house up there at the top of the hill,

1047
00:58:15,562 --> 00:58:17,700
你可能见过。
you might have seen it.

1048
00:58:18,764 --> 00:58:21,033
这一切都可能是你的。
All of it could be yours.

1049
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:26,841
我的诚实和忠诚几乎到了极点。
I'm honest and faithful, almost to a fault.

1050
00:58:29,643 --> 00:58:32,308
如果你感兴趣的话，
So if any of that interests you,

1051
00:58:33,782 --> 00:58:37,280
那就起身去那辆白色的车。
then get up and head out to the white car.

1052
00:58:40,123 --> 00:58:40,717
——“Nelope。
- 'Nelope.

1053
00:58:40,752 --> 00:58:41,651
-我在那儿等你。
- I'll meet you there.

感谢主给我们带来生育的器皿
and we thank you Lord for bringing us a fertile vessel

1298
01:20:33,033 --> 01:20:35,330
这样我们才能继续你的工作，
so that we may continue your work,

1299
01:20:35,366 --> 01:20:38,234
分辨羊群和牧羊人，
to discern the sheep from the shepherd,

1300
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:41,603
只有到那时，我们才能进餐和净化
and only then will we dine and cleanse

1301
01:20:43,206 --> 01:20:45,915

(Frank grunting)

1308

1312
01:21:51,046 --> 01:21:54,511
-不，不，她不是，她永远不会是。

1313
01:21:56,182 --> 01:21:57,619
-我想你会大吃一惊的

1314
01:21:57,654 --> 01:22:00,247
-不，我不会的，这次不会
- No, I won't be, not this time.

1315
01:22:00,283 --> 01:22:01,383
我等了一辈子
I've waited my whole life

1316
01:22:01,418 --> 01:22:03,154
在过去的48小时里陪着她，
to spend the last 48 hours with her,

1317
01:22:03,189 --> 01:22:04,452
即使我只能得到这些
and even if that's all I ever get,

1318
01:22:04,488 --> 01:22:06,995
它会让你所有的感觉都相形见绌。
it'll dwarf anything you've ever felt.

1319
01:22:07,031 --> 01:22:09,959
她和我的爱是死亡也无法偷走的
She and I have a love not even death could steal,

1320
01:22:09,994 --> 01:22:11,363
你知道的。
and you know that.

1321
01:22:11,398 --> 01:22:14,030
你只会在书里读到过，
It's the kind you've only ever read about in books,

1322
01:22:14,065 --> 01:22:16,201
你永远也得不到。
and you'll never get it.

1323
01:22:16,236 --> 01:22:18,438
-你知道我最讨厌什么吗?
- You know what I hate more than anything?

1324
01:22:18,474 --> 01:22:19,734
虚伪。
Hypocrisy.

1325
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:22,811
全世界都是无知的指手画脚者，
The whole world's full of uneducated finger pointers,

1326
01:22:22,846 --> 01:22:25,273
主要是指像我这样的人。
pointing mostly at people like me.

1327
01:22:25,308 --> 01:22:28,245
但毫无疑问，
But make no mistake about it,

1328
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:31,652
我们从永恒的诅咒中拯救灵魂。
we save souls from eternal damnation.

1329
01:22:31,688 --> 01:22:33,988
这就是食罪者所做的。
That's what sin eaters do.

1330
01:22:34,024 --> 01:22:36,892
孩子，那是一桶60加仑的纯净水。
Son, that's a 60 gallon drum of purified water.

1331
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:39,793
至少还能活几个星期。
That's survival for at least a couple weeks.

1332
01:22:39,828 --> 01:22:42,394
当然，除非你饿死。
Unless, of course, you starve.

1333
01:22:45,898 --> 01:22:47,399
告诉我，小子，
So tell me, punk,

1334
01:22:49,238 --> 01:22:53,138
还有多久你就会咬一口，成为我们的一员。
how long until you take a bite and become one of us.

1335
01:22:53,173 --> 01:22:54,908
-如果你敢碰她，我发誓
- If you touch her, I swear to God,

1336
01:22:54,944 --> 01:22:57,706
无论如何，总有一天，我会找到你。
somehow, someday, I will find you.

1337
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:02,310
-这又不是蝙蝠侠
- This isn't a Batman episode.

1338
01:23:02,345 --> 01:23:05,252
你休想离开这里。
You're not getting outta here.

1339
01:23:07,919 --> 01:23:08,750
——“Nelope !
- 'Nelope!

1340
01:23:09,821 --> 01:23:10,653
“Nelope !
'Nelope!

1341
01:23:11,692 --> 01:23:12,622
我来了!
I'm coming!

1342
01:23:23,034 --> 01:23:24,403
-他在哪里?
- Where is he?

1343
01:23:26,509 --> 01:23:27,703
他死了吗?
Is he dead?

1344
01:23:27,739 --> 01:23:32,273
-有一点是肯定的，他不会来找你的。
- One thing's for sure, he's, he's not coming for ya.

1345
01:23:32,308 --> 01:23:34,648
-你不了解弗兰克
- You don't know Frank.

1346
01:23:34,684 --> 01:23:36,448
-我想我知道
- Oh, I think I do.

1347
01:23:37,555 --> 01:23:39,120
-你想要什么?
- What do you want?

1348
01:23:39,156 --> 01:23:41,355
-你这辈子都在放弃什么。
- What you've been giving away your entire life.

1349
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:43,755
我突然想要，你却把它从架子上拿了下来?
All of a sudden I want it and you take it off the shelf?

1350
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:44,823
这是为什么呢?
Why is that?

1351
01:23:44,859 --> 01:23:46,458
-我是非卖品
- I ain't for sale.

1352
01:23:47,630 --> 01:23:49,162
我从来没去过。
I never have been.

1353
01:23:49,198 --> 01:23:51,159
-我打赌外面有很多充气的鸡巴
- I bet there's a lot of inflated dicks out there

1354
01:23:51,195 --> 01:23:52,401
这将不同意。
that would disagree.

1355
01:23:52,437 --> 01:23:53,600
一个是什么?
What's one more?

1356
01:23:53,635 --> 01:23:54,466
——去你妈的!
- Fuck you!

1357
01:23:59,504 --> 01:24:02,471
-你昨晚就该去散步。
- You should have taken that walk last night.

1358
01:24:02,507 --> 01:24:05,442
我知道你考虑过，但你知道，
I know you thought about it, but you know,

1359
01:24:05,477 --> 01:24:08,443
你去找他，这让我很伤心。
you went to him and that just breaks my heart.

1360
01:24:08,479 --> 01:24:11,516
-你没有心碎。
- You don't have a heart to break.

1361
01:24:13,088 --> 01:24:15,589
-你要给我一个孩子。
- You're going to give me a child.

1362
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:17,091
这是一个事实。
That's a fact.

1363
01:24:17,127 --> 01:24:21,189
我宁愿用宠溺而不是用爪子。
I'd rather do it with a coddle then a claw.

1364
01:24:21,224 --> 01:24:22,560
我的意思是,
I mean originally,

1365
01:24:22,595 --> 01:24:26,095
自然界的每一个生育行为都是一场强奸。
every single act procreation in nature was a rape.

1366
01:24:26,130 --> 01:24:28,263
只有人类问道。
Only humans asked.

1367
01:24:28,298 --> 01:24:30,502
-你别碰我。
- You ain't touching me.

1368
01:24:32,272 --> 01:24:35,606
-为什么突然这么值钱了。
- Why is it so valuable all of a sudden.

1369
01:24:36,873 --> 01:24:38,945
我是说，你一直在使用上帝的生殖系统
I mean, you've been using God's reproductive system

1370
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:41,480
作为你一生的工具。
as a tool your entire life.

1371
01:24:41,515 --> 01:24:46,653
我是说，要么性爱是无意义的，要么强奸是不好的。
I mean, either sex is meaningless or rape is bad.

1372
01:24:46,689 --> 01:24:47,651
不能两者兼而有之。
Can't be both.

1373
01:24:55,196 --> 01:24:57,328
-是握着礼物的手
- It's the hand that holds the gift

1374
01:24:57,363 --> 01:24:59,827
可以改变盒子里的东西，
that can change what's in the box,

1375
01:24:59,863 --> 01:25:03,603
我从来都不愿意让别人免费给我。
and I ain't ever willingly held it out for free.

1376
01:25:03,639 --> 01:25:04,536
一次也没有。
Not once.

1377
01:25:05,708 --> 01:25:06,736
不是没有人。
Not for nobody.

1378
01:25:08,271 --> 01:25:09,541
除了弗兰克。
Except Frank.

1379
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:13,576
你以为你已经谈完了
You think you's talking over

1380
01:25:13,612 --> 01:25:17,747
一个卑微的脱衣舞女的脑袋，对吧?
a lowly stripper's head all the time, don't ya?

1381
01:25:19,723 --> 01:25:20,948
会把你生吞活剥
Just eats you alive

1382
01:25:20,984 --> 01:25:26,393
我有一列满载爱的火车只为他而开
that I got a freight train of love headed only for him,

1383
01:25:27,061 --> 01:25:29,264
即使是你也无法改变它。
and not even you can budge it.

1384
01:25:47,146 --> 01:25:48,745
-我可以爱你
- I could love you,

1385
01:25:49,950 --> 01:25:51,319
如果你愿意的话。
if you let me.

1386
01:25:53,591 --> 01:25:54,619
想想。
Think about it.

1387
01:25:56,827 --> 01:25:59,360
明天早上见。
I'll see you in the morning.

1388
01:26:02,433 --> 01:26:03,265
——没有。
- No.

1389
01:26:05,498 --> 01:26:09,535
在我心里，我知道他是来找我的。
Somehow in my heart I know he's coming for me.

1390
01:26:23,517 --> 01:26:27,119
-[电台传道者]谁会感到羞愧。
- [Radio Preacher] Who will be put to shame.

1391
01:26:27,154 --> 01:26:28,622
(用外语)
(speaking in foreign language)

1392
01:26:28,658 --> 01:26:29,819
在希腊,
In Greek,

1393
01:26:29,854 --> 01:26:33,625
你会因为这种错误的自信而感到羞辱。
you will be humiliated by this misplaced confidence.

1394
01:26:35,193 --> 01:26:38,333
(无线聊天)
(Radio chattering)

1395
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:42,997
所以他在诗篇第5章说…
So he says in Psalms 5...

1396
01:26:45,643 --> 01:26:48,310
(不祥的音乐)
(ominous music)

1397
01:26:55,178 --> 01:26:56,010
——爸爸。
- Daddy.

1398
01:26:57,313 --> 01:26:58,753
爸爸,爸爸。
Dad, daddy.

1399
01:26:58,788 --> 01:27:01,653
(莫莉尖叫)
(Molly screaming)

1400
01:27:03,857 --> 01:27:04,689
不!
No!

1401
01:27:06,090 --> 01:27:07,793
不!
No!

1402
01:27:07,828 --> 01:27:08,630
爸爸。
Daddy.

1403
01:27:08,666 --> 01:27:11,333
(莫莉喘气)
(Molly panting)

1404
01:27:19,402 --> 01:27:21,971
(莫莉哭泣)
(Molly sobbing)

1405
01:27:22,007 --> 01:27:22,839
不!
No!

1406
01:27:24,044 --> 01:27:26,678
(紧张的音乐)
(tense music)

1407
01:27:35,858 --> 01:27:38,525
(强烈的音乐)
(intense music)

1408
01:27:51,335 --> 01:27:54,203
(莫莉喘气)
(Molly panting)

1409
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:56,741
(紧张的音乐)
(tense music)

1410
01:28:26,304 --> 01:28:28,905
(莫莉哭)
(Molly crying)

1411
01:28:32,408 --> 01:28:33,613
——对不起,
- I'm sorry,

1412
01:28:36,952 --> 01:28:38,112
为了这一切。
for all of it.

1413
01:28:45,488 --> 01:28:47,990
(紧张的音乐)
(tense music)

1414
01:29:40,412 --> 01:29:42,517
-尽你所能盯着看?
- Stare all you can do?

1415
01:29:44,582 --> 01:29:47,415
-我应该看着你的
- I'm supposed to watch ya.

1416
01:29:47,451 --> 01:29:48,787
Chisos这样说的。
Chisos said so.

1417
01:29:48,822 --> 01:29:53,627
-你知道盯着看和看不是一回事。
- You know staring and watching aren't the same thing.

1418
01:29:54,859 --> 01:29:58,764
我感觉到你在盯着一个强大的东西。
And I feel you staring something powerful.

1419
01:29:59,967 --> 01:30:00,799
是的。
Yeah.

1420
01:30:02,105 --> 01:30:04,803
像货运火车一样强大。
Powerful like a freight train.

1421
01:30:05,771 --> 01:30:09,511
你介意我叫你货运火车吗?
Do you mind if I call you Freight Train?

1422
01:30:11,047 --> 01:30:12,039
-你想要什么都行
- Whatever you want,

1423
01:30:12,074 --> 01:30:15,484
我只是来做我该做的。
I'm just here doing what I'm supposed to.

1424
01:30:18,454 --> 01:30:21,685
-我之前感觉到他们的手在摸我
- You know, I felt them hands on me earlier,

1425
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:25,093
超过了必要的长度，
longer than was strictly necessary,

1426
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:27,661
他们也觉得自己很强大。
and they felt powerful, too.

1427
01:30:29,492 --> 01:30:30,631
但温柔。
But gentle.

1428
01:30:32,564 --> 01:30:34,998
你内心深处是个温柔的家伙吗?
You a gentle fella deep down?

1429
01:30:36,665 --> 01:30:38,166
-不是和女人。
- Not with ladies.

1430
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:41,741
我不是故意的，但是，
I don't mean to be, but,

1431
01:30:42,642 --> 01:30:45,745
我一激动，就会粗暴地对待他们。
I get excited, handle 'em too rough.

1432
01:30:48,451 --> 01:30:52,384
他们带我来的每个人，包括我妻子，
Everyone they brought me, even my wife,

1433
01:30:52,419 --> 01:30:54,849
把她抓得太紧了。
got a hold of her too hard.

1434
01:30:54,885 --> 01:30:58,051
现在她的气管不能正常工作。
Now her windpipe don't work right.

1435
01:30:58,087 --> 01:31:01,893
现在我再也不碰她了。
Shy's away from me touching her at all now.

1436
01:31:02,996 --> 01:31:07,795
-你知道的，当你习惯了粗暴并没有那么糟糕。
- Well you know, rough ain't so bad when you're used to it.

1437
01:31:07,830 --> 01:31:10,402
事实上，粗糙造就了一些女孩
In fact, rough makes some girls

1438
01:31:10,437 --> 01:31:12,937
比庞恰特雷恩河还湿。
wetter than the Pontchartrain.

1439
01:31:15,012 --> 01:31:16,908
你能保守秘密吗?
Can you keep a secret?

1440
01:31:18,741 --> 01:31:20,912
我是其中一个女孩，
I'm one of them girls,

1441
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:23,779
在他们手里我什么都感觉不到
and I ain't felt nothing in them hands

1442
01:31:23,815 --> 01:31:26,918
我发现自己并不需要
that I don't find myself wanting,

1443
01:31:28,488 --> 01:31:31,356
我觉得你也想要
and I think you want it, too.

1444
01:31:31,391 --> 01:31:33,994
他们对我百般呵护。
Them hands all over me.

1445
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:36,928
(玛格达低声呻吟)
(Magda whimpers)

1446
01:31:42,769 --> 01:31:46,773
我不是想骗你出去。
I ain't trying to trick you to get out.

1447
01:31:46,808 --> 01:31:51,008
如果你愿意，你甚至可以进来。
Hell, you could even come in here if you wanted to.

1448
01:31:52,149 --> 01:31:54,143
我要好好抚摸你。
I gotta touch you proper.

1449
01:31:54,179 --> 01:31:56,910
拜托，你不能就这样把我弄出来然后又否定我。
Come on, you can't get me out like this then deny me.

1450
01:31:56,945 --> 01:31:59,416
-奇索斯不会容忍的。
- Chisos wouldn't stand for it.

1451
01:31:59,452 --> 01:32:00,581
-去他的奶酪酱。
- Fuck Cheese Sauce.

1452
01:32:00,617 --> 01:32:02,886
饼干(笑)
(Cookie laughs)

1453
01:32:02,921 --> 01:32:06,826
再说了，我以为我们在保守秘密。
Besides, I thought we was keeping secrets.

1454
01:32:09,565 --> 01:32:11,192
你知道，这是一个永远不会说出去的秘密
You know, it's a secret that's never told

1455
01:32:11,227 --> 01:32:15,830
这提供了最不寻常的悬念。
that offers the most extraordinary of suspense.

1456
01:32:15,865 --> 01:32:18,134
我不知道你们怎么想
And I don't know about you,

1457
01:32:19,869 --> 01:32:23,107
但我不会告诉任何人的
but I ain't gonna tell a soul.

1458
01:32:23,143 --> 01:32:24,112
嘘。
Shh.

1459
01:32:24,147 --> 01:32:27,176
(光戏剧性的音乐)
(light dramatic music)

1460
01:32:41,593 --> 01:32:43,660
-把腿伸出来。
- Stick your leg out.

1461
01:32:43,695 --> 01:32:45,832
-好吧，我会照你说的做
- Okay, I'll do what you say,

1462
01:32:45,868 --> 01:32:50,801
但等我出去了，你也得听我的。
but then when I get out, you gotta do what I say, too.

1463
01:32:50,837 --> 01:32:54,335
取笑会让取悦变得更好。
Teasing makes the pleasing so much better.

1464
01:32:57,780 --> 01:33:01,947
一旦你把那东西固定好，就坐下，好吗?
Once you get that thing fastened, sit down, okay?

1465
01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:19,195
来吧，坐下。
Go on, sit down now.

1466
01:33:30,008 --> 01:33:31,940
我得从桌子上挪开点
Gonna have to scooch away from that table

1467
01:33:31,976 --> 01:33:35,183
如果你想让我坐在你腿上。
if you want me to sit in your lap.

1468
01:33:35,219 --> 01:33:38,918
(光悬疑的音乐)
(light suspenseful music)

1469
01:33:51,899 --> 01:33:56,366
-我要你知道我是个信教的人。
- I need you to know that I'm a religious man.

1470
01:33:56,401 --> 01:33:57,233
我是。
I am.

1471
01:33:59,242 --> 01:34:00,940
我相信，
I do believe in, in,

1472
01:34:00,976 --> 01:34:05,046
通过消灭罪恶来背负这个世界的重量。
in carrying the weight of the world by consuming sin.

1473
01:34:05,082 --> 01:34:06,209
我喜欢，我就是喜欢。
I do, I just do.

1474
01:34:07,378 --> 01:34:10,485
(口吃)即使你们这些人认为我们疯了什么的。
(stuttering) even if you people think we's crazy and all.

1475
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,650
-不，没人觉得你疯了
- No, nobody thinks you're crazy.

1476
01:34:12,685 --> 01:34:13,650
没人觉得你疯了。
Nobody thinks you're crazy.

1477
01:34:13,685 --> 01:34:15,952
-只是，我，我，我，我
- It's just, I, I, I, I,

1478
01:34:15,987 --> 01:34:17,955
我找不到你做错的事。
I can't find nothing wrong ya done.

1479
01:34:17,991 --> 01:34:20,557
-就像我说的，没事，没事。
- Like I said, nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong.

1480
01:34:20,593 --> 01:34:21,793
没有人什么也没做。
Nobody did nothing.

1481
01:34:21,828 --> 01:34:22,792
-如果你犯了什么罪。
- If you'd have done some sinning.

1482
01:34:22,827 --> 01:34:24,529
-没人什么都没做。
- [Frank] Nobody did nothing.

1483
01:34:24,564 --> 01:34:26,267
-我没有问题。
- I'd a had no issue.

1484
01:34:26,302 --> 01:34:27,564
-你得帮帮我。
- Just gotta help me.

1485
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,567
帮我出去。
Help me outta here.

1486
01:34:28,603 --> 01:34:31,834
听着，给我扔根绳子。
Look, just, just throw me a rope.

1487
01:34:31,870 --> 01:34:32,899
-不不不-不不不
- No, no, no. - No, no, no.

1488
01:34:32,935 --> 01:34:34,169
你要做的就是-
All you gotta do is-

1489
01:34:34,205 --> 01:34:35,343
-不，不，闭嘴。-请帮帮我们。
- No, no, shut your mouth. - Help us, please.

1490
01:34:35,378 --> 01:34:36,244
闭上你的臭嘴!
- Just shut your fuckin' mouth!

1491
01:34:36,279 --> 01:34:38,344
闭上你的臭嘴!
Shut your fuckin' mouth!

1492
01:34:38,379 --> 01:34:40,078
马上把它关上!
Just shut it, now!

1493
01:34:43,312 --> 01:34:47,448
我不会为了救你而出卖自己人，
I ain't gonna save you and cross my own people,

1494
01:34:48,424 --> 01:34:50,424
但是你可以拯救你自己。
but you can save yourself.

1495
01:34:50,459 --> 01:34:51,692
-你在说什么?
- What are you talking about?

1496
01:34:51,727 --> 01:34:54,796
(结结巴巴地)你在说什么?
(stuttering) What are you talking about?

1497
01:34:54,832 --> 01:34:57,629
-你得像我一样犯罪才行。
- You gonna have to commit a sin just like me to do it.

1498
01:34:57,664 --> 01:35:00,131
-你在说什么?
- What are you talking about?

1499
01:35:04,108 --> 01:35:06,535
(强烈的音乐)
(intense music)

1500
01:35:06,571 --> 01:35:07,402
他妈的?
The fuck?

1501
01:35:11,509 --> 01:35:12,740
上帝!
God!

1502
01:35:12,776 --> 01:35:15,443
(强烈的音乐)
