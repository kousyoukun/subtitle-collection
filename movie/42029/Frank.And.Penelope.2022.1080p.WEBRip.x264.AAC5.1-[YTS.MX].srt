that passenger seat?

Oh, I guess you already
got one though, don't you?

184
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,943
- No, I don't.

185
00:11:16,978 --> 00:11:19,750
I lost her about 45 minutes ago.

186
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:21,247
Actually probably
lost her years ago.

189
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:27,288

like her CrossFit instructor.

Well, then it means
you ain't in love.

So what are you gonna
do with this ring?

206
00:12:09,668 --> 00:12:12,036
- Throw it away, far away.

Uh, why me?

233
00:13:44,966 --> 00:13:47,632
- 'Cause I got a fault line

- You fucking cunt.

360
00:19:41,855 --> 00:19:44,590
- Fuck you.

361
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:17,323
- 827KCWD.

362
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,425
827KCWD.

363
00:20:27,531 --> 00:20:28,593
- I don't know what
happened back there,

364
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,999
but I'm really, really sorry.

365
00:20:31,035 --> 00:20:32,837
- That was rage.

366
00:20:32,873 --> 00:20:33,965
That was pure rage,

367
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:36,505
and I don't ever want you
to be sorry about that.

368
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:40,208
'Cause if a man don't
fly into a rage, then,

369
00:20:40,243 --> 00:20:42,040
then he isn't in love.

370
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,912
- "I shot a man."

371
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:51,687
"My God, this girl is
drugs, good drugs."

372
00:20:53,758 --> 00:20:55,460
- And the
sum total experience with her

373
00:20:55,495 --> 00:20:59,695
is nothing short of the
Controlled Substances Act.

374
00:21:00,462 --> 00:21:02,129
But that man deserved it,

375
00:21:02,165 --> 00:21:03,600
and I shot him.

376
00:21:10,072 --> 00:21:11,778
- Hey.

377
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,377
What if I told you that,

378
00:21:14,412 --> 00:21:17,644
I don't wanna be
no shotgun no more?

379
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,185
- The fuck you talking
about, 'Nelope?

380
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:23,788
- Well maybe I want
an upgrade, baby.

381
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,083
To ride or die.

382
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,091

makes no fucking sense at all,

387
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,015

00:32:45,402 --> 00:32:49,404
that, that little want
makes all the difference.

539
00:32:51,337 --> 00:32:54,142
He says that that, that want,

540
00:32:54,177 --> 00:32:57,280
is what bring the
carn, the carnal,

541
00:32:59,053 --> 00:33:03,418
into the cathedral and the,
the hole into the holy.

542
00:33:23,075 --> 00:33:26,474
I, I was just, I was
just talking is all.

543
00:33:27,848 --> 00:33:30,610
I, I, I don't mean
nothing by it.

544
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:45,826
- Baby, baby, baby.

545
00:33:45,861 --> 00:33:47,563
- Hm, what?

546
00:33:47,598 --> 00:33:48,400
- Fuck.

547
00:33:48,435 --> 00:33:49,496
Fuck, okay.

548
00:33:49,531 --> 00:33:52,231
Okay, put the money
away, put the money away.

549
00:33:52,267 --> 00:33:54,199
Where's the gun,
where's the gun?

550
00:33:54,235 --> 00:33:55,301
Hurry up.
- It's okay.

551
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:58,770
- Hurry up, hurry up,
hurry up, hurry up.

552
00:34:00,406 --> 00:34:02,142
- It's gonna be okay.

553
00:34:02,177 --> 00:34:04,743
I, I'll just talk to him, baby.

554
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:14,258
- Beautiful.

555
00:34:22,768 --> 00:34:24,763
Say hello to sin for me.

556
00:34:27,004 --> 00:34:29,174
I love this time of the year.

557
00:34:29,209 --> 00:34:33,073
Classics all over the blacktop,
all going at the show.

558
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:34,577
Y'all showing or selling?

559
00:34:34,612 --> 00:34:35,841
- Both.

560
00:34:35,876 --> 00:34:38,445
Who knows, you might even
pull us over on the way back,

561
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,414
driving in something
even sweeter than this

562
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:43,588
if I see something that
makes my thighs twitch.

563
00:34:45,457 --> 00:34:50,222
- I don't know, sweetie, it's
hard to beat a 68 B, but uh,

564
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:52,296
damn, likes cars, too.

565
00:34:54,033 --> 00:34:56,163
Got yourself a good
one there, son.

566
00:34:56,198 --> 00:34:58,063
- Please, he ain't got shit.

567
00:34:58,099 --> 00:34:59,164
He's my brother.

568
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,097
- Oh, is that right?

569
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:01,538
- Mm-hm.

570
00:35:01,573 --> 00:35:02,405
- Well.

571
00:35:04,305 --> 00:35:06,038
So what you got under there?

572
00:35:06,073 --> 00:35:07,278
- Underwear.

573
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,814
Just kiddin'.

574
00:35:09,849 --> 00:35:13,244
It's a V8, fuckin' big one, too.

575
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:14,714
- I'll bet it is.

576
00:35:17,518 --> 00:35:19,252
So what, you gonna
keep it a secret?

577
00:35:19,287 --> 00:35:21,387
- Well, you know what they say,

578
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:22,753
it's the secret
that's never told

579
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:26,797
that offers the most
extraordinary suspense.

580
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,060
- Yeah, that's a good one.

581
00:35:28,096 --> 00:35:29,298
Who said that?

582
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,263
- Tell him it's from
Big Daddy Don Garlic.

583
00:35:30,298 --> 00:35:32,569
- Fucking Big Daddy Dan Garlic.

584
00:35:32,604 --> 00:35:33,397
- Don.

585
00:35:33,432 --> 00:35:34,233
- That's what I meant.

586
00:35:34,268 --> 00:35:35,202
- It's Garlets.
- Don.

587
00:35:35,237 --> 00:35:36,573
- And I believe his last was-

588
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:37,703
- Garlets.

589
00:35:37,772 --> 00:35:40,612
- Oh yeah, he was a hell
of mopar driver, wasn't he?

590
00:35:40,648 --> 00:35:41,573
- Sure as hell was.

591
00:35:41,675 --> 00:35:43,507
Hell, I love the way
he drove them mopers.

592
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:45,881
He fuckin' owns 'em, he does.

593
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:47,582
- Hey, look honey,

594
00:35:48,685 --> 00:35:53,022
you got anything you wanna
show off on the way back in,

595
00:35:53,057 --> 00:35:55,292
you just gimme a holler, hear?

596
00:35:55,328 --> 00:35:59,528
- Well you better keep
your ears on, good buddy.

597
00:36:00,933 --> 00:36:02,264
- Well, anyway,

598
00:36:02,299 --> 00:36:04,235
the real reason I
pulled y'all over

599
00:36:04,271 --> 00:36:06,804
is you're about to hit a
stretch of about 30 miles

600
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,337
with no cell phone towers,

601
00:36:08,372 --> 00:36:11,406
and no gas for another
40 miles after that.

602
00:36:11,441 --> 00:36:14,445
You may wanna keep a
close eye on that gauge.

603
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,509
I mean, you can get gas in
Quicksilver about 12 miles in,

604
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:21,448
but get in and get outta there.

605
00:36:21,484 --> 00:36:23,552
Mercury got in the
water from that mine

606
00:36:23,588 --> 00:36:27,088
and left them Appalachian
transplants bat shit crazy.

607
00:36:27,123 --> 00:36:29,327
What's left 'em, anyway.

608
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:32,957
Well, I don't wanna keep y'all.

609
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,067
Hey, you ever let
her drive that thing?

610
00:36:39,102 --> 00:36:40,599
- Every once in a while.

611
00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:43,204
- 'Cause I would
love to see a beauty

612
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:44,675
behind the wheel of the beauty.

613
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,544
What was that?

614
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,945
- Cricket.

615
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,243
Damn things been caught in here

616
00:36:49,278 --> 00:36:51,515
since we got gas in Marathon.

617
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,817
And yeah, I only let him drive
when I need to take a nap.

618
00:36:53,853 --> 00:36:55,650
Let's switch, Tommy.

619
00:37:02,494 --> 00:37:06,226
- If y'all wanna smoke 'em
up on the way outta here,

620
00:37:06,261 --> 00:37:07,891
ain't nobody looking.

621
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:10,597
You won't see no berries
and cherries from me.

622
00:37:10,633 --> 00:37:14,900
- Well, I'm a give you a
front row seat, law man.

623
00:37:41,527 --> 00:37:43,030
- Well, this is it.

624
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:44,595
It, it's humble.

625
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,001
But rooms are clean though.

626
00:37:47,037 --> 00:37:48,505
I, I make sure.

627
00:37:49,473 --> 00:37:52,608
The, the office is
there on the right.

628
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,505
- Hi daddy, it's Molly.

629
00:38:55,572 --> 00:38:59,070
Um, I'm calling from
a motel phone 'cause,

630
00:39:00,247 --> 00:39:03,613
'cause I'm on that
dead spot on the 16.

631
00:39:04,614 --> 00:39:07,881
And I know, I'm sorry,
but, but listen.

632
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,858
- Women
I would like you.

633
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:15,926
Too bad I like guys.

634
00:39:15,962 --> 00:39:18,059
Like you.

635
00:39:18,094 --> 00:39:19,528
- All right.

636
00:39:19,563 --> 00:39:21,425
Find out a lot more
about you than I like.

637
00:39:21,461 --> 00:39:22,797
- I told you...

638
00:39:24,435 --> 00:39:25,630
- Anyway, I hope
you get this soon

639
00:39:25,665 --> 00:39:27,804
so you can come and get me.

640
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:28,803
Yeah.

641
00:39:30,974 --> 00:39:31,836
Okay.

642
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:34,941
Hopefully I see
you in the morning.

643
00:39:36,447 --> 00:39:37,812
I love you, daddy.

644
00:39:37,847 --> 00:39:42,553
- Didn't recall you asking
to use any extra services.

645
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,589
- Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.

646
00:39:46,356 --> 00:39:48,424
I just had to make a quick call.

647
00:39:48,459 --> 00:39:51,760
Um, you can add it
to my bill though.

648
00:39:53,698 --> 00:39:57,969
- It was up to me, I, I
wouldn't charge you at all.

649
00:39:58,005 --> 00:39:59,867
Well, five's my favorite.

650
00:40:00,801 --> 00:40:04,501
Just always it's
always smells good.

651
00:40:04,537 --> 00:40:06,109
Don't know why.

652
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,846
- Need a witness, Cleve.

653
00:40:07,881 --> 00:40:09,212
Oh, oh I'm sorry.

654
00:40:09,248 --> 00:40:10,612
I didn't realize
you had company.

655
00:40:10,647 --> 00:40:13,813
- Oh no, no, we, we
was just finishing up.

656
00:40:13,848 --> 00:40:17,118
Oh there, there's free
drinks in the bar later.

657
00:40:17,153 --> 00:40:18,485
- Oh thanks.

658
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,020
I'm, I'm just so tired though.

659
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:32,867
- Surprised you didn't
rip your britches.

660
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:42,811
- Shut your damn mouth.

Baby.

673
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:28,857
- Well hello, you two.

674
00:41:29,825 --> 00:41:30,989
Pardon, but I always
put my hands together

675
00:41:31,024 --> 00:41:34,764
in the time of need,
and low and behold.

676
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:37,762
Seems we like the same vintage,

677
00:41:37,797 --> 00:41:40,198
just from a different branch.

678
00:41:41,635 --> 00:41:43,839
Stopped, don't know why.

679
00:41:44,806 --> 00:41:46,076
Think you too could
give me a ride?

680
00:41:46,111 --> 00:41:46,974
- Yes.
- No.

681
00:41:48,575 --> 00:41:49,840
Can't help you.

682
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:52,076
But this is a friend of mine.

683
00:41:52,112 --> 00:41:55,950
And if you give him a
call, I'm sure he can.

684
00:41:57,188 --> 00:41:58,989
- I'll make due.

685
00:41:59,025 --> 00:42:00,086
- Suit yourself.

686
00:42:24,483 --> 00:42:26,645
- Sorry I had to
step out, Ophelia.

687
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,713
We have a leaky faucet.

688
00:42:27,748 --> 00:42:29,880
I had to put maintenance on it.

689
00:42:29,915 --> 00:42:31,419
So you were saying that uh,

690
00:42:31,454 --> 00:42:32,622
you left your husband

691
00:42:32,657 --> 00:42:34,122
when you met this
fella at a conference?

692
00:42:34,157 --> 00:42:35,185
- I did.

693
00:42:35,221 --> 00:42:38,889
Within the hour, I was
in a car with him and,

694
00:42:38,924 --> 00:42:40,760
and we were leaving everything

695
00:42:40,796 --> 00:42:43,833
that I forgot was
important to me.

696
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:49,003
David was six when I left.

697
00:42:51,874 --> 00:42:56,747
And, little
Laurie was three.

698
00:42:58,047 --> 00:43:03,052
I haven't seen or spoke
to my babies in 37 years.

699
00:43:03,088 --> 00:43:04,018
37 years.

700
00:43:05,852 --> 00:43:08,220
- Does it serve you right?

701
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:13,632
- I suppose it does.
- Hm.

702
00:43:14,965 --> 00:43:19,204
I saw you listed on the
register as an Ophelia Wendall.

703
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:20,835
Is that your maiden or his?

704
00:43:20,871 --> 00:43:22,099
- Oh no, I never wanted
to change my last name.

705
00:43:22,135 --> 00:43:23,868
- You know, it don't
really seem right

706
00:43:23,903 --> 00:43:25,243
sharing names with little ones

707
00:43:25,278 --> 00:43:27,905
when you only donated the nature

708
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,649
and ran away from the nurture.

709
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:35,650
Hope you got your heart
right with the Lord.

710
00:43:35,686 --> 00:43:36,917
- I think I'll
take my check now.

711
00:43:36,952 --> 00:43:39,884
- No, no, there's no
check for the truth.

712
00:43:39,919 --> 00:43:42,254
You told it fair and square.

713
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:49,360
- Have a nice day.

714
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,935
- Well it's settled.

715
00:43:55,971 --> 00:43:59,106
You don't hold no
truck with adultery.

716
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:01,207
What?

717
00:44:04,148 --> 00:44:05,079
What?

718
00:44:07,152 --> 00:44:07,983
- Nothing.

719
00:44:09,948 --> 00:44:12,487
You got Chisos pegged.

720
00:44:12,522 --> 00:44:13,690
Hell, if he was here, I,

721
00:44:13,725 --> 00:44:16,253
I reckon lightning
come down from heaven,

722
00:44:16,288 --> 00:44:19,060
strike that adulterer
dead on the spot.

723
00:44:19,095 --> 00:44:22,596
- You know damn well the
Lord don't work like that.

724
00:44:22,631 --> 00:44:24,362
We gotta do his will.

725
00:44:26,834 --> 00:44:28,170
- Well, I'll go tell Cookie now.

726
00:44:28,205 --> 00:44:29,103

No sir, none of the above.

All right, if uh, y'all

755
00:46:19,811 --> 00:46:20,613
- Mm-hm.

756
00:46:20,648 --> 00:46:21,850
- Oh no, no.

757
00:46:21,885 --> 00:46:22,782
We, we'll settle

00:46:22,817 --> 00:46:24,922

759
00:46:27,019 --> 00:46:29,223
- Damn, she's beautiful.

760
00:46:30,263 --> 00:46:31,560
- What's that?

761
00:46:31,596 --> 00:46:34,463
Oh uh, yeah, they all are.

762
00:46:34,499 --> 00:46:36,230
- Who'd a hung her?

763
00:46:37,536 --> 00:46:40,234
- She took the bite, didn't she?

764
00:46:41,135 --> 00:46:44,536
- We'll take the
flower back, please.

765
00:46:44,571 --> 00:46:48,472
- Now there's uh, there's
drinks in the bar after dark.

766
00:46:48,508 --> 00:46:53,283
If y'all sit with Mabel,
just, just give her this.

767
00:46:53,319 --> 00:46:54,444
- Who's Mabel?

768
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:58,415
- Oh, Maybelline, she,
she's my, she's my wife.

769
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:02,055
She, she runs the, the
bar and the, the diner.

770
00:47:02,091 --> 00:47:05,123
It gets kind of lonely
out here, so uh,

771
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:07,398
so ifin y'all got
a story to tell,

772
00:47:07,434 --> 00:47:09,894
she'll be happy to listen.

773
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:11,367
First two are free.

774
00:47:11,403 --> 00:47:12,963
What's TOT mean?

775
00:47:12,998 --> 00:47:14,771
- Table of truth.

776
00:47:14,806 --> 00:47:17,468
And uh, she'll know
if you're lying.

777
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:20,278
- We can't miss out on
an opportunity like that,

778
00:47:20,313 --> 00:47:21,506
now can we, baby?

779
00:47:30,456 --> 00:47:32,217
- Did they move the car?

780
00:47:32,252 --> 00:47:33,653
- It's right in
front of the room.

781
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:39,794
- I got it all topped
off and ready for you.

782
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:41,996
Parked it in front of your room.

783
00:47:42,031 --> 00:47:45,366
Even washed the
windshield for you.

784
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:48,271
- Hey, you mind if I freshen
up and meet you at the bar?

785
00:47:48,306 --> 00:47:49,138
- Okay.

786
00:47:51,144 --> 00:47:52,343
Hey.

787
00:47:52,378 --> 00:47:54,077
- Yeah?

788
00:47:55,078 --> 00:47:56,877
- Can I swat you on the
ass as you walk away?

789
00:47:56,912 --> 00:47:59,412
I, I always wanted to do that.

790
00:48:02,181 --> 00:48:04,681
- You don't have to ask, baby.

791
00:48:07,591 --> 00:48:08,960
Just swing it.

792
00:49:08,246 --> 00:49:10,855
- I'm sorry about this,

793
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:13,887
But you shouldn't have
done what you done.

794
00:49:13,923 --> 00:49:16,291
Don't worry, we'll fix ya.

795
00:49:17,597 --> 00:49:19,624
Right after I fix this one.

796
00:50:02,741 --> 00:50:04,273
I think that girl heard me.

797
00:50:04,308 --> 00:50:06,042
And, and then she was, she
was staring right at me.

798
00:50:06,077 --> 00:50:08,179
- And what would she
have heard, Cookie?

799
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:12,116
The sound of a wrinkly old lady
being strung up by her foot?

800
00:50:12,151 --> 00:50:13,712
She couldn't even name that
tune with all the notes.

801
00:50:13,747 --> 00:50:15,578
- You didn't tell me there was
somebody in the corner room.

802
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:17,621
- Well, I just
checked her in today.

803
00:50:17,657 --> 00:50:18,548
- But you didn't tell me.

804
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:20,353
There wasn't supposed
to be nobody.

805
00:50:20,388 --> 00:50:23,191
I wouldn't have been
carrying that lady's,

806
00:50:23,226 --> 00:50:24,356
I mean, if I knew that
there was somebody

807
00:50:24,392 --> 00:50:25,529
I wouldn't have been
carrying the leg.

808
00:50:25,565 --> 00:50:27,131
- Okay, okay, okay.

809
00:50:27,831 --> 00:50:29,562
I'll go check on her.

810
00:50:35,805 --> 00:50:37,207
- Miss?

811
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:41,475
You, you, you okay in there?

812
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,774
- Yep, all good.

813
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,317
- Oh, okay.

814
00:50:49,956 --> 00:50:52,648
Well, you know, I
was, I was just uh,

815
00:50:52,684 --> 00:50:55,619
I was just checking
on you 'cause um,

816
00:50:55,654 --> 00:50:58,822
'cause, 'cause you ain't
take no dinner and,

817
00:50:58,858 --> 00:51:01,624
and hell you, you ain't poked
your head out all night.

818
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:04,932
So uh, so I was just
checking on you.

819
00:51:04,968 --> 00:51:07,636
Make sure you, you's okay.

820
00:51:07,671 --> 00:51:08,398
- I'm okay.

821
00:51:08,433 --> 00:51:11,503
I just, I just get migraines.

822
00:51:11,538 --> 00:51:14,337
- Oh, I could bring
you something if, if,

823
00:51:14,372 --> 00:51:16,712
ifin that would help.

824
00:51:16,748 --> 00:51:18,512
- Nope, that's okay.

825
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:20,712
- Oh, sure, sure.

826
00:51:23,749 --> 00:51:28,159
Well, I just, I just um,
I, I just wanna say um,

827
00:51:29,487 --> 00:51:32,229
I'm, I'm sorry about before.

828
00:51:33,665 --> 00:51:34,726
When I, when I,

829
00:51:36,362 --> 00:51:38,796
when I touched-
- That's okay.

830
00:51:40,703 --> 00:51:41,535
- Okay.

831
00:51:51,849 --> 00:51:53,547
All right then, uh.

832
00:51:56,522 --> 00:51:57,320
Goodnight.

833
00:52:01,692 --> 00:52:02,688
- Goodnight.

834
00:52:24,614 --> 00:52:27,750
- Chisos says most people
take double helpings of a lie

835
00:52:27,785 --> 00:52:29,647
if it tastes good.

836
00:52:29,683 --> 00:52:32,588
Leave a healthy plate of
truth out for the dogs.

837
00:52:32,624 --> 00:52:33,455
- Not me.

838
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:38,125
- Yeah, I guess it depends on
who you're sinning against.

839
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,689
- Chisos words don't lie, child.

840
00:52:39,724 --> 00:52:42,926
- Wait a minute,
who's Cheese Sauce?

841
00:52:43,801 --> 00:52:44,961
- It's Chisos.

842
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:49,101
Ain't nothing more powerful
than won't come outta his mouth.

843
00:52:49,137 --> 00:52:50,505
And I seen his words

844
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:53,569
bring a screaming freight
train to a complete stop.

845
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:56,647
- You mean like an actual train?

846
00:52:56,683 --> 00:52:57,674
- Like a choo choo?

847
00:52:57,709 --> 00:53:00,549
- Yes, darling, an
actual choo choo.

848
00:53:00,584 --> 00:53:02,782
He done it from the front
window in the diner upstairs.

849
00:53:02,817 --> 00:53:05,584
A bunch of doubters heard the
Stud of Butte line coming.

850
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:09,491
He rose up and held out
his hands like this,

851
00:53:10,755 --> 00:53:12,723
said a few of
those Gaelic words.

852
00:53:12,758 --> 00:53:15,593
You could hear those
brakes from miles away.

853
00:53:15,628 --> 00:53:18,632
All 36 cars come
to a complete stop.

854
00:53:19,567 --> 00:53:22,369
Few more words, he
even made it back up.

855
00:53:22,405 --> 00:53:23,871
- You sure it wasn't
just side tracked?

856
00:53:24,909 --> 00:53:26,805
- It was side tracking.

857
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:31,714
I'm sure you two have
seen it done to a car.

858
00:53:31,749 --> 00:53:32,608
Am I right?

859
00:53:32,643 --> 00:53:34,410
- I see you got it running, huh?

860
00:53:34,446 --> 00:53:36,318
- It's just a fuse.

861
00:53:36,353 --> 00:53:37,953
Just a little tickle
with my middle finger

862
00:53:37,988 --> 00:53:39,818
and it fired right up.

863
00:53:42,326 --> 00:53:45,863
- Oh my God, baby, did
you just hear that?

864
00:53:45,898 --> 00:53:47,461
Somewhere off in the distance

865
00:53:47,496 --> 00:53:51,269
a freight train just
made a fucking U-turn.

866
00:53:53,706 --> 00:53:54,704
- I'm Chisos.

867
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:56,067
- Oh, I'm Frank.

868
00:53:56,102 --> 00:53:56,901
- Frank.

869
00:53:58,108 --> 00:54:00,611
Hey, you two are honeymooners.

870
00:54:00,647 --> 00:54:01,240
Is that right?

871
00:54:01,275 --> 00:54:02,846
- Yeah, that's right.

872
00:54:02,881 --> 00:54:03,940
We got your king size

873
00:54:03,975 --> 00:54:06,575
with the flower back
headboard and everything.

874
00:54:06,611 --> 00:54:08,577
We'll try not to wake you.

875
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:10,354
- You know what they say,

876
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:13,385
you throw a lie in a river
five days before the truth,

877
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,123
the truth is gonna catch up.

878
00:54:15,158 --> 00:54:18,195
- Especially at this table.

879
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:21,297
- Most don't make it out
here without a reason.

880
00:54:21,332 --> 00:54:24,333
Being that we're off
the beaten path and all.

881
00:54:24,369 --> 00:54:27,500
So tell me, where are
you newly weds headed?

882
00:54:27,535 --> 00:54:29,774
- Well, see, as a,
as a wedding gift,

883
00:54:29,809 --> 00:54:30,534
my new husband, yeah,

884
00:54:30,569 --> 00:54:31,769
he's promised to take me down

885
00:54:31,804 --> 00:54:33,776
the prettiest road in
the whole fuckin' world.

886
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:34,738
- Oh well, you-

887
00:54:34,774 --> 00:54:35,880
- Well this is the
wrong part of the world

888
00:54:35,915 --> 00:54:38,115
to find the prettiest road.

889
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,342
- Yeah, it ain't
in this stink hole.

890
00:54:40,378 --> 00:54:41,748
It's west.

891
00:54:41,783 --> 00:54:44,547
My baby here, he said that
he saw it in some movie,

892
00:54:44,582 --> 00:54:46,517
uh, "Thelma & Louise."

893
00:54:46,552 --> 00:54:48,056
It's this road that they go down

894
00:54:48,091 --> 00:54:49,524
at the end of the movie,

895
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:53,564
and my baby here, he's
gonna take me for a ride.

896
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:54,431
- Wow.

897
00:54:55,399 --> 00:54:58,297
What a generous and
kind man you are.

898
00:54:58,332 --> 00:55:00,637
I've seen that movie.

899
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:01,934
Amazing.

900
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:06,938
To see two love birds about
to take each other for a ride.

901
00:55:07,947 --> 00:55:10,508
You mind if I join you two?

902
00:55:10,543 --> 00:55:12,481
- Well only if you have a story.

903
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:15,279
You know, seeing as how
that's the rules and all.

904
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:16,512
- Get us two.

905
00:55:16,547 --> 00:55:17,788
- Just, just two?

906
00:55:17,823 --> 00:55:19,217
- Just for us men.

907
00:55:19,253 --> 00:55:20,523
- Oh.

908
00:55:21,457 --> 00:55:24,588
- So uh, what is
it you do out here?

909
00:55:24,623 --> 00:55:26,494
- But the short version though,

910
00:55:26,529 --> 00:55:29,628
'cause I'm about ready
for that headboard.

911
00:55:29,663 --> 00:55:32,265
- Well the truth
can't be truncated.

912
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,130
- Well, try your best.

913
00:55:36,304 --> 00:55:38,308
- How's this for Cliffs?

914
00:55:38,343 --> 00:55:41,707
Family came out from
Appalachia in 1903.

915
00:55:41,742 --> 00:55:43,742
This mine's been in my
family for generations.

916
00:55:43,777 --> 00:55:46,851
We were the mercury
capital of the world,

917
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:48,649
till the mine collapsed.

918
00:55:48,685 --> 00:55:50,983
My grandfather was trapped
underneath that mine.

919
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:54,585
He was leading a prison work
release program for murderers,

920
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:57,555
rapists, all kinds of filth.

921
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,857
They were left there for dead,

922
00:55:59,892 --> 00:56:02,229
until he came walking
out 11 days later

923
00:56:02,264 --> 00:56:03,628
when the plate shifted.

924
00:56:03,664 --> 00:56:04,995
He was the only
one that made it.

925
00:56:05,031 --> 00:56:09,506
Three dead felons left
below, gnawed to the bone.

926
00:56:10,535 --> 00:56:12,071
- That's crazy.

927
00:56:12,106 --> 00:56:16,340
- See my grandfather,
he survived by
eating those sinners,

928
00:56:16,376 --> 00:56:17,811
organs and all.

929
00:56:19,016 --> 00:56:20,644
Not a secret.

930
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:22,714
Made the papers everywhere.

931
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:25,486
What is a secret is
that we are still

932
00:56:25,521 --> 00:56:28,322
Appalachian sin
eaters at our core.

933
00:56:28,357 --> 00:56:29,519
We have been for centuries.

934
00:56:29,554 --> 00:56:30,989
It's in our blood.

935
00:56:31,024 --> 00:56:34,124
So all the drifters, the
travelers, all the runners,

936
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,569
they come and sit down here
at this table and confess,

937
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:41,635
and we consume in proportion
to the severity of the sin.

938
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:44,769
Sometimes it's just
a BB behind the ear.

939
00:56:44,805 --> 00:56:48,308
Sometimes it's an
unsurvivable filet,

940
00:56:48,344 --> 00:56:50,540
enough for a table of six.

941
00:56:50,575 --> 00:56:52,011
- What's he doing?

942
00:56:52,046 --> 00:56:54,749
- What he always does when
he ain't gonna let 'em leave.

943
00:56:54,784 --> 00:56:56,851
Fills them with a truth
that's too hard to believe.

944
00:56:56,886 --> 00:57:00,354
- We take the cell phones
down the Juarez, we dump 'em.

945
00:57:00,389 --> 00:57:03,054
We burn the bodies and the cars.

946
00:57:04,494 --> 00:57:06,161
No one has any
idea that it is us

947
00:57:06,196 --> 00:57:07,364
that takes on the burden

948
00:57:07,399 --> 00:57:10,399
that the world would
otherwise have to carry.

949
00:57:10,434 --> 00:57:12,201
I'm equal opportunity
to at fault,

950
00:57:12,236 --> 00:57:14,868
even when it comes to myself.

951
00:57:15,836 --> 00:57:19,235
Sometimes I consume a
taste of my own sin.

952
00:57:20,474 --> 00:57:22,077
- Ugh.
- Jesus Christ.

953
00:57:22,113 --> 00:57:23,877
- I'm just kidding.

954
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:28,750
But the train part, that's true.

955
00:57:29,614 --> 00:57:31,115
At will on a dime.

956
00:57:32,489 --> 00:57:33,924
And just not
inanimate locomotives.

957
00:57:33,959 --> 00:57:35,418
- Like what else?

958
00:57:35,454 --> 00:57:36,588
- People.

959
00:57:36,623 --> 00:57:37,822
I know all about incentives,

960
00:57:37,857 --> 00:57:41,094
motivations and
overall psychology.

961
00:57:41,129 --> 00:57:41,961
- Okay.

962
00:57:43,364 --> 00:57:44,766
Try me, Freud.

963
00:57:48,904 --> 00:57:53,341
- My family owned over
6,000 mercury rich acres,

964
00:57:53,376 --> 00:57:55,040
but now I'm the only one left.

965
00:57:55,076 --> 00:57:59,913
So last April, I sold almost
all of it for $24 million.

966
00:58:02,816 --> 00:58:05,352
Now I have no one
to spend it on.

967
00:58:05,388 --> 00:58:07,790
No one to give me a child.

968
00:58:07,825 --> 00:58:11,992
And I really want one, for
more than just legacy reasons.

969
00:58:12,027 --> 00:58:15,527
That modest little house up
there at the top of the hill,

970
00:58:15,562 --> 00:58:17,700
you might have seen it.

971
00:58:18,764 --> 00:58:21,033
All of it could be yours.

972
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:26,841
I'm honest and faithful,
almost to a fault.

973
00:58:29,643 --> 00:58:32,308
So if any of that interests you,

974
00:58:33,782 --> 00:58:37,280
then get up and head
out to the white car.

975
00:58:40,123 --> 00:58:40,717
- 'Nelope.

976
00:58:40,752 --> 00:58:41,651
- I'll meet you there.

977
00:58:42,854 --> 00:58:44,053
- I'm gonna have a word here

978
00:58:44,089 --> 00:58:46,756
and make sure he's
equally compensated.

979
00:58:46,791 --> 00:58:48,962
- 'Nelope, look at me.

980
00:58:50,464 --> 00:58:52,262
'Nelope, 'Nelope!

981
00:58:52,297 --> 00:58:57,707
- Son, son, son, she's a
stripper, she's a grifter.

982
00:58:58,241 --> 00:58:58,972
They all sell it.

983
00:59:00,206 --> 00:59:02,011
If she hasn't taken you
for everything, she will.

984
00:59:02,047 --> 00:59:03,174
- No, she's not.

985
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:08,246
- So I'm gonna get a nice
little wad of cash for ya.

986
00:59:08,281 --> 00:59:13,250
When you check out, it'll help
to heal that broken heart.

987
00:59:23,931 --> 00:59:27,902
- Morning coffee if he
won't take it today.

988
00:59:30,541 --> 00:59:33,436
- Hey, aren't you
gonna finish that?

989
00:59:33,471 --> 00:59:37,310
It's a wonderful vintage of
distilled damnation right there.

990
01:00:21,555 --> 01:00:23,056
- Hey.

991
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:27,896
- God damn I love you, 'Nelope.

992
01:00:32,964 --> 01:00:36,400
- Sorry, I had to tinkle,

993
01:00:36,435 --> 01:00:42,075
and I couldn't take any more
of that garbage he was spewing.

994
01:00:43,879 --> 01:00:47,977
Hey, you know all those
ways you never told me

995
01:00:48,012 --> 01:00:51,048
how you were gonna fuck me?

996
01:00:51,083 --> 01:00:53,017
Well, could you just
forget about 'em

997
01:00:53,053 --> 01:00:56,292
and come over here
and make love to me

998
01:00:56,327 --> 01:00:58,190
for a really long time?

999
01:01:00,764 --> 01:01:04,694
- After that, girl, you
don't even get a say.

he put, he put his

1010
01:02:29,584 --> 01:02:31,118
I'm okay though.

1011
01:02:44,403 --> 01:02:45,966
- You fucked up really bad,

1012
01:02:46,001 --> 01:02:48,302
and you're gonna have
to make it right.

1013
01:02:48,337 --> 01:02:49,202
- Okay.

1014
01:02:50,303 --> 01:02:52,040
- You got a newborn not
two months in the ground

1015
01:02:52,076 --> 01:02:55,276
and you're already letting
your lustful ways lead you.

1016
01:02:55,311 --> 01:02:56,110
- Do I?

1017
01:02:57,247 --> 01:02:58,546
Do I?

1018
01:02:58,582 --> 01:02:59,614
- What do you whine about?

1019
01:02:59,649 --> 01:03:02,415
- Oh shut up, just shut up.

1020
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:03,954
- What?

1021
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:08,021
- You tell me how Mabel give
me a, a boy two months ago,

1022
01:03:08,056 --> 01:03:11,559
and she ain't late with
me in, in three years.

1023
01:03:11,594 --> 01:03:12,889
You tell me how, huh?

1024
01:03:12,925 --> 01:03:15,297
Make me understand-

1025
01:03:24,171 --> 01:03:26,870
- 19 Calls from her
daddy to this number

1026
01:03:26,906 --> 01:03:28,571
starting at- 24 AM.

1027
01:03:29,982 --> 01:03:32,312
I researched the number, he's
a Sanctus County Sheriff.

1028
01:03:32,347 --> 01:03:37,250
He'll be 616 South, and Cookie
said she saw him holding-

1029
01:03:38,585 --> 01:03:39,417
- Go.

1030
01:03:44,525 --> 01:03:45,357
You too.

1031
01:04:17,494 --> 01:04:18,294
- Come on, daddy.

1032
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:19,292
Where are you?

1033
01:04:20,294 --> 01:04:22,625
- God damn I love waking
up next to you, 'Nelope.

1034
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:25,094
- I can't believe you
thought I was gonna leave you

1035
01:04:25,129 --> 01:04:27,102
for the Cheese Sauce.

1036
01:04:27,137 --> 01:04:31,403
That idiot doesn't stand
a chance against my Frank.

1037
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,841
- We're
stuck together, baby.

1038
01:04:34,876 --> 01:04:37,776
- Like hot gum on tarmac stuck.

1039
01:04:41,418 --> 01:04:42,315
Holy shit.

1040
01:04:43,751 --> 01:04:45,054
Is this real?

1041
01:04:45,687 --> 01:04:47,123
- Is that another?

1042
01:04:47,158 --> 01:04:52,358
- Oh my God, a Bugs Bunny level
of karats if I ever did see.

1043
01:04:55,294 --> 01:04:56,892
- With this diamond
will thee wed?

1044
01:04:56,927 --> 01:04:57,968
- Don't!

1045
01:04:59,203 --> 01:05:02,535
And don't you never do that
again, unless you mean it.

1046
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:03,402
- Okay.

1047
01:05:05,642 --> 01:05:07,409
I was just kidding.

1048
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:08,343
- I'm serious.

1049
01:05:08,378 --> 01:05:09,342
- Okay.

1050
01:05:10,778 --> 01:05:12,345
- I'm not a joke.

1051
01:05:14,449 --> 01:05:18,520
- Swear to God I'm gonna
surprise you one day, 'Nelope.

1052
01:05:18,556 --> 01:05:20,221
- They's just words.

1053
01:05:49,288 --> 01:05:50,119
- Morning.

1054
01:05:51,086 --> 01:05:53,323
Just uh, two for
breakfast, please.

1055
01:05:59,224 --> 01:06:02,227
- Uh, yeah, anywhere you want.

1056
01:06:02,262 --> 01:06:05,398
- I'm a go with
them cakes, Cookie.

1057
01:06:07,264 --> 01:06:09,932
Damn, this is amazing.

1058
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:11,008
- Hm?

1059
01:06:12,038 --> 01:06:14,077
- My dad was a Marine.

1060
01:06:15,381 --> 01:06:17,007
- You two close?

1061
01:06:17,043 --> 01:06:18,708
- Yeah, were really.

1062
01:06:22,818 --> 01:06:24,714
Lost him when I was 16.

1063
01:06:25,622 --> 01:06:27,156
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1064
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:31,391
- Don't be, 'cause
my 16 with him

1065
01:06:31,427 --> 01:06:36,330
was better than 100 would've
been with any lesser man.

1066
01:06:38,434 --> 01:06:43,634
I planned enlisting myself,
but uh, after my dad died,

1067
01:06:44,602 --> 01:06:48,045
I had to take care of my
mom and little sister.

1068
01:06:49,012 --> 01:06:51,741
- I bet he's proud
of you, Frank.

1069
01:06:52,714 --> 01:06:53,545
- Hope so.

1070
01:06:55,815 --> 01:06:56,647
- He is.

1071
01:06:58,822 --> 01:07:01,124
And what about you, Frank?

1072
01:07:02,058 --> 01:07:04,528
Do you want any
babies of your own?

1073
01:07:04,563 --> 01:07:06,459
- Never not wanted 'em.

1074
01:07:12,964 --> 01:07:13,796
You?

1075
01:07:17,808 --> 01:07:20,341
- Well, I haven't until now.

1076
01:07:45,668 --> 01:07:47,062
Take him.

1077
01:07:47,097 --> 01:07:48,636
- What?

1078
01:07:48,671 --> 01:07:49,502
- Take him.

1079
01:08:08,518 --> 01:08:10,454
- Get your ass outta the car.

1080
01:08:10,489 --> 01:08:11,654
What did I tell ya?
- No, please!

1081
01:08:11,689 --> 01:08:13,463
- What the, you're
the one that made me-

1082
01:08:14,532 --> 01:08:15,829
- Take him.

1083
01:08:15,864 --> 01:08:17,530
Take him with you.

1084
01:08:18,329 --> 01:08:20,434
He'll be our protector.

1085
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,271
Your dad.

1086
01:08:25,775 --> 01:08:27,107
Just take him.

1087
01:08:32,813 --> 01:08:33,645
- Hey!

1088
01:08:35,215 --> 01:08:37,484
Hey, knock that shit off.

1089
01:08:38,152 --> 01:08:40,085
Get your hands off of her!

1090
01:08:40,121 --> 01:08:41,688
Turn around, turn around.

1091
01:08:41,724 --> 01:08:42,651
- She was-

1092
01:08:42,687 --> 01:08:45,855
- Turn around, put
your hands on the hood.

1093
01:08:47,632 --> 01:08:48,431
You okay, sweetie?

1094
01:08:48,466 --> 01:08:49,160
- Yeah.

1095
01:08:49,195 --> 01:08:49,894
- Yeah?
- I'm okay.

1096
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:51,367
Thank you.

1097
01:08:51,402 --> 01:08:54,001
- What kind of man puts his
hands on a lady like that, huh?

1098
01:08:54,036 --> 01:08:54,999
What is wrong with you, boy?

1099
01:09:05,747 --> 01:09:06,579
- Hey!

1100
01:09:08,784 --> 01:09:10,520
- Freeze!

1101
01:09:10,556 --> 01:09:11,584
Uh, something!

1102
01:09:13,586 --> 01:09:16,451
- Yeah, freeze it right,
you fuckin' weirdo!

1103
01:09:16,487 --> 01:09:18,693
- 'Nelope, go get the car.

1104
01:09:18,728 --> 01:09:19,454
- I'm on it.

1105
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:22,490
- You, drop that shotgun!

1106
01:09:22,526 --> 01:09:24,696
And you, shut the fuck up!

1107
01:09:28,606 --> 01:09:29,437
Thank you.

1108
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:48,588
- What the hell just happened?

1109
01:09:50,122 --> 01:09:51,261
Turn right.

1110
01:09:52,124 --> 01:09:53,263
Turn right.

1111
01:09:54,129 --> 01:09:56,629
Turn right you motherfucker.

1112
01:10:10,474 --> 01:10:12,610
Two in the green car.

1113
01:10:12,645 --> 01:10:15,816
- Copy that, they
will not get past us.

1114
01:10:28,525 --> 01:10:30,159
- Speak of the devil.

1115
01:10:30,194 --> 01:10:31,394
- Fuck.

1116
01:10:31,429 --> 01:10:33,633
They're making a U-turn.

1117
01:10:36,367 --> 01:10:37,670
- Go, go, go.

1118
01:10:43,275 --> 01:10:44,543
- It's okay, baby.

1119
01:10:44,578 --> 01:10:46,408
It's probably just
that guy from before.

1120
01:10:46,444 --> 01:10:48,783
I think he likes me.

1121
01:11:06,771 --> 01:11:07,832
- Who's that?

1122
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:10,802
- Hm.

1123
01:11:14,538 --> 01:11:16,679
Hey, where's my buddy?

1124
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:18,612
Frank!

1125
01:11:40,904 --> 01:11:42,805
- Hey, hey, hey!

1126
01:11:42,841 --> 01:11:44,368
Hey, the, the girl!

1127
01:11:44,403 --> 01:11:46,037
- You bring the long?

1128
01:11:46,072 --> 01:11:46,871
- Uh.

1129
01:11:48,173 --> 01:11:48,972
Uh.

1130
01:11:51,781 --> 01:11:52,580
Oh.

1131
01:12:05,928 --> 01:12:06,759

Now!

1157
01:14:04,949 --> 01:14:06,582
- What about her?

1158
01:14:08,078 --> 01:14:11,884
- We're cleansing, but
I ain't touching it.

1159
01:14:29,741 --> 01:14:30,573
Cookie!

1160
01:14:34,504 --> 01:14:35,545
Cookie.

1161
01:14:43,648 --> 01:14:45,283
- I can't lift 'em.

1162
01:15:06,938 --> 01:15:08,742
- Take this one
and get her stowed.

1163
01:15:08,778 --> 01:15:11,774
He's on his way and we've
got a burden to consume.

1164
01:15:11,809 --> 01:15:14,312
Hey, use this if there's a need.

1165
01:18:29,809 --> 01:18:32,674
- He's, he's already up there.

1166
01:18:32,709 --> 01:18:33,511
- Good.

1167
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:38,955
Get her cleaned
and ready for me.

1168
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:39,822
- Okay.

1169
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:52,098
- And with a gentle touch.

1170
01:19:14,391 --> 01:19:15,957
- Hand me the hose.

1171
01:19:22,365 --> 01:19:23,426
Gentle touch.

1172
01:19:24,327 --> 01:19:26,699
- Ain't you supposed
to sponge it?

1173
01:19:26,734 --> 01:19:28,836
- Told you, I ain't touching it.

1174
01:19:28,872 --> 01:19:32,534
- You wanna sponge it
head to toe, go ahead.

1175
01:19:38,614 --> 01:19:41,146
You just don't understand,

1176
01:19:41,182 --> 01:19:45,382
there ain't no harvest
between our whore's legs.

1177
01:20:20,724 --> 01:20:23,926
- Dear Lord, we
take this Eucharist,

1178
01:20:25,128 --> 01:20:28,458
your your last living gift,
the righteous man's sustenance,

1179
01:20:28,494 --> 01:20:32,998
and we thank you Lord for
bringing us a fertile vessel

1180
01:20:33,033 --> 01:20:35,330
so that we may
continue your work,

1181
01:20:35,366 --> 01:20:38,234
to discern the sheep
from the shepherd,

1182
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:41,603
and only then will
we dine and cleanse

1183
01:20:43,206 --> 01:20:45,915
until the sheep are no more.

1184
01:20:48,117 --> 01:20:51,112
- Wash me
thoroughly from my iniquities,

1185
01:20:51,148 --> 01:20:54,090
and cleanse me from my...

1186
01:20:54,125 --> 01:20:55,456
- Sin.

1187
01:20:55,492 --> 01:20:57,292
- Amen.

1188
01:21:40,232 --> 01:21:42,337
- You tried longer
than all of them.

1189
01:21:47,576 --> 01:21:49,345
- Where is she?

1190
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:51,011
- Waiting for me.

1191
01:21:51,046 --> 01:21:54,511
- No, no she's not,
and she never will be.

1192
01:21:56,182 --> 01:21:57,619
- Oh, I think
you'll be surprised.

1193
01:21:57,654 --> 01:22:00,247
- No, I won't be, not this time.

1194
01:22:00,283 --> 01:22:01,383
I've waited my whole life

1195
01:22:01,418 --> 01:22:03,154
to spend the last
48 hours with her,

1196
01:22:03,189 --> 01:22:04,452
and even if that's
all I ever get,

1197
01:22:04,488 --> 01:22:06,995
it'll dwarf anything
you've ever felt.

1198
01:22:07,031 --> 01:22:09,959
She and I have a love not
even death could steal,

1199
01:22:09,994 --> 01:22:11,363
and you know that.

1200
01:22:11,398 --> 01:22:14,030
It's the kind you've only
ever read about in books,

1201
01:22:14,065 --> 01:22:16,201
and you'll never get it.

1202
01:22:16,236 --> 01:22:18,438
- You know what I hate
more than anything?

1203
01:22:18,474 --> 01:22:19,734
Hypocrisy.

1204
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:22,811
The whole world's full of
uneducated finger pointers,

1205
01:22:22,846 --> 01:22:25,273
pointing mostly
at people like me.

1206
01:22:25,308 --> 01:22:28,245
But make no mistake about it,

1207
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:31,652
we save souls from
eternal damnation.

1208
01:22:31,688 --> 01:22:33,988
That's what sin eaters do.

1209
01:22:34,024 --> 01:22:36,892
Son, that's a 60 gallon
drum of purified water.

1210
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:39,793
That's survival for at
least a couple weeks.

1211
01:22:39,828 --> 01:22:42,394
Unless, of course, you starve.

1212
01:22:45,898 --> 01:22:47,399
So tell me, punk,

1213
01:22:49,238 --> 01:22:53,138
how long until you take a
bite and become one of us.

1214
01:22:53,173 --> 01:22:54,908
- If you touch her,
I swear to God,

1215
01:22:54,944 --> 01:22:57,706
somehow, someday,
I will find you.

1216
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:02,310
- This isn't a Batman episode.

1217
01:23:02,345 --> 01:23:05,252
You're not getting outta here.

1218
01:23:07,919 --> 01:23:08,750
- 'Nelope!

1219
01:23:09,821 --> 01:23:10,653
'Nelope!

1220
01:23:11,692 --> 01:23:12,622
I'm coming!

1221
01:23:23,034 --> 01:23:24,403
- Where is he?

1222
01:23:26,509 --> 01:23:27,703
Is he dead?

1223
01:23:27,739 --> 01:23:32,273
- One thing's for sure,
he's, he's not coming for ya.

1224
01:23:32,308 --> 01:23:34,648
- You don't know Frank.

1225
01:23:34,684 --> 01:23:36,448
- Oh, I think I do.

1226
01:23:37,555 --> 01:23:39,120
- What do you want?

1227
01:23:39,156 --> 01:23:41,355
- What you've been giving
away your entire life.

1228
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:43,755
All of a sudden I want it and
you take it off the shelf?

1229
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:44,823
Why is that?

1230
01:23:44,859 --> 01:23:46,458
- I ain't for sale.

1231
01:23:47,630 --> 01:23:49,162
I never have been.

1232
01:23:49,198 --> 01:23:51,159
- I bet there's a lot of
inflated dicks out there

1233
01:23:51,195 --> 01:23:52,401
that would disagree.

1234
01:23:52,437 --> 01:23:53,600
What's one more?

1235
01:23:53,635 --> 01:23:54,466
- Fuck you!

1236
01:23:59,504 --> 01:24:02,471
- You should have taken
that walk last night.

1237
01:24:02,507 --> 01:24:05,442
I know you thought
about it, but you know,

1238
01:24:05,477 --> 01:24:08,443
you went to him and that
just breaks my heart.

1239
01:24:08,479 --> 01:24:11,516
- You don't have
a heart to break.

1240
01:24:13,088 --> 01:24:15,589
- You're going to
give me a child.

1241
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:17,091
That's a fact.

1242
01:24:17,127 --> 01:24:21,189
I'd rather do it with
a coddle then a claw.

1243
01:24:21,224 --> 01:24:22,560
I mean originally,

1244
01:24:22,595 --> 01:24:26,095
every single act procreation
in nature was a rape.

1245
01:24:26,130 --> 01:24:28,263
Only humans asked.

1246
01:24:28,298 --> 01:24:30,502
- You ain't touching me.

1247
01:24:32,272 --> 01:24:35,606
- Why is it so valuable
all of a sudden.

1248
01:24:36,873 --> 01:24:38,945
I mean, you've been using
God's reproductive system

1249
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:41,480
as a tool your entire life.

1250
01:24:41,515 --> 01:24:46,653
I mean, either sex is
meaningless or rape is bad.

1251
01:24:46,689 --> 01:24:47,651
Can't be both.

1252
01:24:55,196 --> 01:24:57,328
- It's the hand
that holds the gift

1253
01:24:57,363 --> 01:24:59,827
that can change
what's in the box,

1254
01:24:59,863 --> 01:25:03,603
and I ain't ever willingly
held it out for free.

1255
01:25:03,639 --> 01:25:04,536
Not once.

1256
01:25:05,708 --> 01:25:06,736
Not for nobody.

1257
01:25:08,271 --> 01:25:09,541
Except Frank.

1258
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:13,576
You think you's talking over

1259
01:25:13,612 --> 01:25:17,747
a lowly stripper's head
all the time, don't ya?

1260
01:25:19,723 --> 01:25:20,948
Just eats you alive

1261
01:25:20,984 --> 01:25:26,393
that I got a freight train
of love headed only for him,

1262
01:25:27,061 --> 01:25:29,264
and not even you can budge it.

1263
01:25:47,146 --> 01:25:48,745
- I could love you,

1264
01:25:49,950 --> 01:25:51,319
if you let me.

1265
01:25:53,591 --> 01:25:54,619
Think about it.

1266
01:25:56,827 --> 01:25:59,360
I'll see you in the morning.

1267
01:26:02,433 --> 01:26:03,265
- No.

1268
01:26:05,498 --> 01:26:09,535
Somehow in my heart I
know he's coming for me.

1269
01:26:23,517 --> 01:26:27,119
- Who
will be put to shame.

1270
01:26:28,658 --> 01:26:29,819
In Greek,

1271
01:26:29,854 --> 01:26:33,625
you will be humiliated by
this misplaced confidence.

1272
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:42,997
So he says in Psalms 5...

1273
01:26:55,178 --> 01:26:56,010
- Daddy.

1274
01:26:57,313 --> 01:26:58,753
Dad, daddy.

1275
01:27:03,857 --> 01:27:04,689
No!

1276
01:27:06,090 --> 01:27:07,793
No!

1277
01:27:07,828 --> 01:27:08,630
Daddy.

1278
01:27:22,007 --> 01:27:22,839
No!

1279
01:28:32,408 --> 01:28:33,613
- I'm sorry,

1280
01:28:36,952 --> 01:28:38,112
for all of it.

1281
01:29:40,412 --> 01:29:42,517
- Stare all you can do?

1282
01:29:44,582 --> 01:29:47,415
- I'm supposed to watch ya.

1283
01:29:47,451 --> 01:29:48,787
Chisos said so.

1284
01:29:48,822 --> 01:29:53,627
- You know staring and
watching aren't the same thing.

1285
01:29:54,859 --> 01:29:58,764
And I feel you staring
something powerful.

1286
01:29:59,967 --> 01:30:00,799
Yeah.

1287
01:30:02,105 --> 01:30:04,803
Powerful like a freight train.

1288
01:30:05,771 --> 01:30:09,511
Do you mind if I call
you Freight Train?

1289
01:30:11,047 --> 01:30:12,039
- Whatever you want,

1290
01:30:12,074 --> 01:30:15,484
I'm just here doing
what I'm supposed to.

1291
01:30:18,454 --> 01:30:21,685
- You know, I felt them
hands on me earlier,

1292
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:25,093
longer than was
strictly necessary,

1293
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:27,661
and they felt powerful, too.

1294
01:30:29,492 --> 01:30:30,631
But gentle.

1295
01:30:32,564 --> 01:30:34,998
You a gentle fella deep down?

1296
01:30:36,665 --> 01:30:38,166
- Not with ladies.

1297
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:41,741
I don't mean to be, but,

1298
01:30:42,642 --> 01:30:45,745
I get excited,
handle 'em too rough.

1299
01:30:48,451 --> 01:30:52,384
Everyone they brought
me, even my wife,

1300
01:30:52,419 --> 01:30:54,849
got a hold of her too hard.

1301
01:30:54,885 --> 01:30:58,051
Now her windpipe
don't work right.

1302
01:30:58,087 --> 01:31:01,893
Shy's away from me
touching her at all now.

1303
01:31:02,996 --> 01:31:07,795
- Well you know, rough ain't
so bad when you're used to it.

1304
01:31:07,830 --> 01:31:10,402
In fact, rough makes some girls

1305
01:31:10,437 --> 01:31:12,937
wetter than the Pontchartrain.

1306
01:31:15,012 --> 01:31:16,908
Can you keep a secret?

1307
01:31:18,741 --> 01:31:20,912
I'm one of them girls,

1308
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:23,779
and I ain't felt
nothing in them hands

1309
01:31:23,815 --> 01:31:26,918
that I don't find
myself wanting,

1310
01:31:28,488 --> 01:31:31,356
and I think you want it, too.

1311
01:31:31,391 --> 01:31:33,994
Them hands all over me.

1312
01:31:42,769 --> 01:31:46,773
I ain't trying to
trick you to get out.

1313
01:31:46,808 --> 01:31:51,008
Hell, you could even come
in here if you wanted to.

1314
01:31:52,149 --> 01:31:54,143
I gotta touch you proper.

1315
01:31:54,179 --> 01:31:56,910
Come on, you can't get me
out like this then deny me.

1316
01:31:56,945 --> 01:31:59,416
- Chisos wouldn't stand for it.

1317
01:31:59,452 --> 01:32:00,581
- Fuck Cheese Sauce.

1318
01:32:02,921 --> 01:32:06,826
Besides, I thought we
was keeping secrets.

1319
01:32:09,565 --> 01:32:11,192
You know, it's a secret
that's never told

1320
01:32:11,227 --> 01:32:15,830
that offers the most
extraordinary of suspense.

1321
01:32:15,865 --> 01:32:18,134
And I don't know about you,

1322
01:32:19,869 --> 01:32:23,107
but I ain't gonna tell a soul.

1323
01:32:23,143 --> 01:32:24,112
Shh.

1324
01:32:41,593 --> 01:32:43,660
- Stick your leg out.

1325
01:32:43,695 --> 01:32:45,832
- Okay, I'll do what you say,

1326
01:32:45,868 --> 01:32:50,801
but then when I get out, you
gotta do what I say, too.

1327
01:32:50,837 --> 01:32:54,335
Teasing makes the
pleasing so much better.

1328
01:32:57,780 --> 01:33:01,947
Once you get that thing
fastened, sit down, okay?

1329
01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:19,195
Go on, sit down now.

1330
01:33:30,008 --> 01:33:31,940
Gonna have to scooch
away from that table

1331
01:33:31,976 --> 01:33:35,183
if you want me to
sit in your lap.

1332
01:33:51,899 --> 01:33:56,366
- I need you to know
that I'm a religious man.

1333
01:33:56,401 --> 01:33:57,233
I am.

1334
01:33:59,242 --> 01:34:00,940
I do believe in, in,

1335
01:34:00,976 --> 01:34:05,046
in carrying the weight of
the world by consuming sin.

1336
01:34:05,082 --> 01:34:06,209
I do, I just do.

1337
01:34:07,378 --> 01:34:10,485
even if you people
think we's crazy and all.

1338
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,650
- No, nobody thinks
you're crazy.

1339
01:34:12,685 --> 01:34:13,650
Nobody thinks you're crazy.

1340
01:34:13,685 --> 01:34:15,952
- It's just, I, I, I, I,

1341
01:34:15,987 --> 01:34:17,955
I can't find nothing
wrong ya done.

1342
01:34:17,991 --> 01:34:20,557
- Like I said, nothing's
wrong, nothing's wrong.

1343
01:34:20,593 --> 01:34:21,793
Nobody did nothing.

1344
01:34:21,828 --> 01:34:22,792
- If you'd have
done some sinning.

1345
01:34:22,827 --> 01:34:24,529
- Nobody did nothing.

1346
01:34:24,564 --> 01:34:26,267
- I'd a had no issue.

1347
01:34:26,302 --> 01:34:27,564
- Just gotta help me.

1348
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,567
Help me outta here.

1349
01:34:28,603 --> 01:34:31,834
Look, just, just
throw me a rope.

1350
01:34:31,870 --> 01:34:32,899
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

1351
01:34:32,935 --> 01:34:34,169
All you gotta do is-

1352
01:34:34,205 --> 01:34:35,343
- No, no, shut your mouth.
- Help us, please.

1353
01:34:35,378 --> 01:34:36,244
- Just shut your fuckin' mouth!

1354
01:34:36,279 --> 01:34:38,344
Shut your fuckin' mouth!

1355
01:34:38,379 --> 01:34:40,078
Just shut it, now!

1356
01:34:43,312 --> 01:34:47,448
I ain't gonna save you
and cross my own people,

1357
01:34:48,424 --> 01:34:50,424
but you can save yourself.

1358
01:34:50,459 --> 01:34:51,692
- What are you talking about?

1359
01:34:51,727 --> 01:34:54,796
What are
you talking about?

1360
01:34:54,832 --> 01:34:57,629
- You gonna have to commit
a sin just like me to do it.

1361
01:34:57,664 --> 01:35:00,131
- What are you talking about?

1362
01:35:06,571 --> 01:35:07,402
The fuck?

1363
01:35:11,509 --> 01:35:12,740
God!

1364
01:35:39,539 --> 01:35:40,974
- No child, no.

1365
01:35:50,682 --> 01:35:52,183
Bless you, child.

1366
01:35:54,119 --> 01:35:57,554
I'll tell him you loved
him by dying today.

1367
01:36:18,415 --> 01:36:19,774
You're still out, ain't you?

1368
01:36:23,981 --> 01:36:26,012
You keep that love alive.

1369
01:36:26,048 --> 01:36:28,289
You hear me, child?

1370
01:36:28,324 --> 01:36:30,023
You hold on tight.

1371
01:36:31,053 --> 01:36:33,392
Don't ever let it go.

1372
01:37:06,889 --> 01:37:07,929
- Scooch.

1373
01:37:17,169 --> 01:37:20,939
- You get in that
corner and turn around.

1374
01:37:20,974 --> 01:37:23,311
This ain't a wifely
thing to watch.

1375
01:37:33,322 --> 01:37:34,252
- Uh-uh-uh.

1376
01:37:35,558 --> 01:37:38,289
Teasin' first, pleasin' second.

1377
01:37:43,629 --> 01:37:44,625
Here you go.

1378
01:37:47,336 --> 01:37:48,167
Just look.

1379
01:37:52,042 --> 01:37:57,176
You never laid eyes on anything
like this before, have you?

1380
01:38:06,017 --> 01:38:08,319
You ready, Freight Train?

1381
01:38:12,261 --> 01:38:13,093
Tell me.

1382
01:38:13,956 --> 01:38:15,695
- I'm ready.

1383
01:38:15,730 --> 01:38:18,329
- No, look at me and tell me.

1384
01:38:20,028 --> 01:38:21,233
- I'm ready.

1385
01:38:25,339 --> 01:38:29,978
- If you meet him, tell him
I'm sorry about the past.

1386
01:38:42,151 --> 01:38:44,190
- 'Nelope, I'm coming!

1387
01:38:58,771 --> 01:39:00,173
- Frank, Frank!

1388
01:39:01,544 --> 01:39:03,374
Oh God damn it, Frank!

1389
01:39:04,611 --> 01:39:05,442
- 'Nelope!

1390
01:39:06,748 --> 01:39:08,176
- Frank, Frank!

1391
01:39:08,211 --> 01:39:10,516
Frank, I can't reach the keys!
