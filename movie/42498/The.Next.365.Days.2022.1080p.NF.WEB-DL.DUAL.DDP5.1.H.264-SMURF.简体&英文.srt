‎我知道 我发现他做了什么之后 ‎我有一个星期都没跟他说话
I know. And when I found out what he had done, I didn't talk to him, like, for a week.

366
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,160
‎我知道他把你伤得很深

Hello! Do you hear me? Can you help me, please?

Mrs. Olga, please! Back to your room! I must go to Mrs. Torricelli!

‎在你出现之前 一切都是那么完美
Everything was so perfect until you showed up.

387
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,120
‎我想我爱上你了

‎我不住在这里
I don't live here.

390
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,200

391

‎你可以逃避我…
You can run away from me…

398
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,200
‎但你无法逃避自己的感觉

399
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,240
‎你怎么知道我是什么感觉 
How do you know what I feel?

400

‎我想看

‎你很担心

‎当然了 马西莫找不到我 肯定很生气
For sure, Massimo got mad because he wasn't able to track me.

‎如果你不想 也可以不用回去
If you don't want to, you don't have to go back.

‎那会是最简单的方法 但现在 我…
It would be the easiest way. But at this moment, I--

426
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:27,600

‎我跟他不一样

432
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,280
‎-他没有告诉你… ‎-告诉我什么 
-He hasn't told you… -Told me what?

01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:55,720
‎当安娜打中了你 而不是马西莫时 ‎她试图再次对他开枪
When Anna shot you instead of Massimo, she tried to shoot him again.

434
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:59,360

‎我不希望以你的痛苦来换取我的幸福

440
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,080

441
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,720
‎这对你会更容易些

‎我希望你能选择跟我共度余生

‎我距离要求跟你离婚只差一步了
I'm one step away from asking you for a divorce.

456

‎离婚 
Divorce?

457
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,200
‎这是什么新…
What is this? New?

458
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,560
‎你都跟谁说话了 
Who did you talk to?

459
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,280
‎嘿 我在跟你说话呢
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I'm talking to you. I'm talking to you.

‎现在我也进退维谷了
Now I'm in my own limbo.

‎我不知道自己想要什么 ‎但我内心很孤独
I don't know what I want, but I'm alone there.

‎我需要空间 弄清楚自己的感觉

‎你还没嫁给多梅尼科呢
You haven't married Domenico yet,

Remember, just say the word, and I'll fucking kill both of them.

And I'll find you a nice, calm guy from a village near Radom, okay?

511
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:11,880
‎好吧 怎么了

‎你妈妈认为 人们只有在遭遇危机时
Your mom is convinced that people buy motorcycles

530
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:47,760
‎才会去买摩托车
when they're going through some kind of crisis.

531
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,720
‎亲爱的 你就快30岁了
Honey, you'll be 30 soon.

532
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:56,960
‎如果一切无恙 ‎你应该跟老公一起庆祝你的生日
If you were okay, you'd be spending your birthday with your husband,

533
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,800
‎庆祝你们的初遇
celebrating the anniversary of your first meeting.

534
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:02,480
‎-而据我所知… ‎-我陷入爱河了 妈妈
-As far as I know-- -I'm in love with someone else.

535
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:14,640
‎他叫纳乔
His name is Nacho.

536
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:18,920
‎亲爱的 给我拿支烟
Honey, get me a cigarette.

537
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:23,560
‎但我们说好了的 以后不再抽烟了

All right then.

540
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:25,040
‎告诉我 亲爱的 如果你不是 ‎马西莫的老婆 你会选谁 
Honey, if you weren't married to Massimo, who would you choose?

541
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,880
‎问题就是我不知道
The problem is, I don't know.

542
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:34,000
‎等你知道问题的答案以后 ‎你就知道该怎么做了
When you have the answer, you'll know what to do.

543
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,040

I think it's what's kept our marriage alive for 35 years.
