4
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,480
Tell them
to get the fuck out of here. Now.

5
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,200
Bang, bang!

6
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,080
No way! Look at you!

7
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,320
You made it downstairs!

8
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,080
But shouldn't you be resting?

9
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,520
What is it with you and resting?

10
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,840
I've had enough rest
to last me a lifetime.

11
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,360
I'm tired of lying in bed
and having you baby me.

12
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,320
That's hardcore.
It's not even 11:00 yet.

13
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,080
That's bad, even for me.

14
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,360
Need I remind you that you almost died?

15
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,600
-Getting drunk at breakfast is a bad idea.
-For fuck's sake.

16
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,600
Why does everyone suddenly
think they know what I need?

17
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,960
Do you have any idea
what we've been through?

18
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,960
I've never been so afraid of losing you.

19
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,840
And Massimo…

20
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,600
…his heart nearly broke.

21
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,560
Olo, I know how hard it was for you
and I know you're worried about me,

22
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,120
but I've been given a second chance.

23
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,240
I want to make the most of it.

24
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,720
Besides, we haven't even toasted
to you changing your mind about marriage.

25
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
What?

26
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,080
Nothing.

27
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,840
I'm just happy you're here.

28
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,560
I can't look
at that hair sober.

29
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,640
Excuse me.

30
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,360
Wow.
So you're ready to go, then.

31
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
You just had sex.

32
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,400
And what makes you say that?

33
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,400
You're not wearing any panties.

34
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,760
But that's not the only thing.

35
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,400
Your hair…

36
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,160
and your lipstick.

37
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,640
So what? We bumped into each other

38
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,760
"And I fucked him."

39
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,640
Yes, I fucked him.

40
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,080
Listen, I want to hear
every kinky little detail, got it?

41
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,800
Quit smirking and come help me,
or we'll never get out the door.

42
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,880
I've already got
everything picked out. Here.

43
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
This one?

44
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,960
-Or this one?
-The black one.

45
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,320
-Hey! Stop!
- Tell me everything.

46
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,360
Lari!

47
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,160
Did you tell Massimo we were going out?

48
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,040
Obviously… not!

49
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,720
He doesn't tell me when he goes out.

50
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,960
Fuck. Well, this is gonna be interesting!

51
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,120
-Come on, really? This place?
-What's the big deal?

52
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,240
All the good restaurants
in town belong to the Torricellis.

53
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,160
Let's go.

54
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,680
Now,
that's what I call a food baby.

55
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,160
Well, just more to love.

56
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,160
Hello?

57
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,840
Who was that?

58
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,880
- How was everything?
-Great. Thanks.

59
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,840
Thank you.

60
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,960
Tell me the truth.

61
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,760
Olo, sometimes the truth is complicated.

62
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,880
Lari, what happened on that island?

63
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,800
-He was just different.
- Who?

64
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880
Nacho.

65
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,760
I ran away with him
after Massimo cheated with Anna.

66
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,840
Hold on. I thought
that was a plot against Massimo.

67
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,200
It was,
but I didn't know it at the time.

68
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,440
Nacho was like my… best friend.

69
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,360
Seriously? You saw the guy twice,
and now he's your best friend?

70
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,320
Whatever. I'm not here to lecture you.

71
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,800
Sure sounds like it.

72
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,560
Did you sleep with him?

73
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
No.

74
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,240
But he was there for me
when my whole world was falling apart.

75
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,240
He took care of me, and I felt free.

76
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,240
Okay.

77
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,600
I have to forget about him.

78
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,680
Oh my God.

79
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,360
You're in love with him.

80
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,880
Don't be ridiculous. He's just some guy.

81
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
Okay, come on.

82
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,320
We're going dancing.

83
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,880
Sorry, maestro.

84
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,480
Rematch later?

85
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,000
Yeah?

86
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,120
What do you mean?

87
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
What?

88
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,080
And you're just telling me this now?

89
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,440
No. Fix this today.

90
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,760
I don't give a shit.

91
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,560
Massimo, what's wrong?

92
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,440
Giuseppe fucked up, as usual.

93
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,600
I've known you my entire life.

94
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,400
These kinds of things never get to you.

95
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,040
Either you're getting old,
or something else is up.

96
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,280
-Tommy.
-Yeah?

97
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,040
I'm out.

98
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,040
Hey!
Why the hell are you in such a hurry?

99
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,240
My marriage is falling apart,
so I'm focusing on my career.

100
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,360
Now, come on!

101
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,080
That's great,
but do we really have to walk this much?

102
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,960
I'm so over this.

103
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,240
Check this out.

104
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,520
- The first one.
-It's great.

105
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,160
It has wide sleeves.

106
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,040
Got it! What about this one?

107
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,720
Hi!

108
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,080
Hiya, Mama Klara!

109
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,520
I'm getting married!

110
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,040
- Okay, Mom…
-Really? Congratulations!

111
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,800
-Like the dress?
-I'll call later.

112
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,200
Beautiful!

113
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,360
-My little…
-I'll call you. Bye. Love you.

114
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,920
Kisses. Bye.

115
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,920
-Bye!

116
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,680
That was nice.

117
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,920
The photographer
needs to be tall and handsome.

118
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,800
Why? 'Cause I say so.

119
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,560
Plus, if the photos are from below,
it'll look like we have double chins,

120
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,920
which we don't want.

121
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,800
Just like this. Click, click, click.

122
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,040
Okay, fine. He can be short and handsome,
but he's gonna need a ladder.

123
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,960
Olo!

124
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,040
Thank you. Grazie.

125
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,680
And then I'll plop my bare ass
right on the cake.

126
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,840
Shit, you're not listening to me.

127
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,040
I am listening.

128
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,680
What kind of photographer do I want?

129
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,040
One with his ass in the cake.

130
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,040
You're unbelievable!

131
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,040
I can't believe you!

132
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,520
Massimo, let's go.

133
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,800
I'll catch up with you later.

134
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,760
- Morning.
- Ma'am!

135
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,760
- Not now.
- Ma'am!

136
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,000
Did you see the email?
Go on, read it!

137
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,080
We're going to Portugal!

138
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,440
I'm here.

139
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,080
Sorry, I couldn't leave amore mio
with a hard-on.

140
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,360
And now… what happens
in Lagos stays in Lagos!

141
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,480
-They were in the villa the entire time?
-The whole day, why?

142
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,640
He didn't even come to say goodbye?

143
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,920
I don't think we can fix this.

144
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,080
How much longer?

145
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,080
Nailed it.

146
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,200
You're such a drunk.

147
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,800
Are you trying
to fucking scare me to death?

148
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,320
What are you wearing?

149
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,520
You're going out drinking with me in this?

150
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,600
Olo, I'm exhausted!

151
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,080
We've got a big meeting tomorrow.
I want to rest.

152
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,040
I can't believe you!

153
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:58,200
-Weren't you the one talking about change?
-Watch me.

154
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,120
-"I'm back from the dead!"
-Look at me. I'm lying down.

155
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,760
-Wait, what was it you said?
- I'm beginning to live.

156
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,560
What a poet.
Shame you don't practice what you preach.

157
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:11,800
-Get up! I'm not sitting around all day!
-Ola, no!

158
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,000
-You have one minute!
-You're crazy!

159
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,960
-The clock is ticking! Sixty!
-Olo!

160
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,680
-Fifty-nine, fifty-eight…

161
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,520
Hey,
the view's pretty good down here.

162
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,920
-Olo?
-What?

163
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,800
Aren't you engaged?

164
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,440
I'm just looking.

165
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,920
His board's nice too.

166
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,320
Hey, cocktails.

167
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,880
I don't get it.

168
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,000
How can you be that into
messing up your hair in the waves?

169
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,320
-There's something primal about it.
-What?

170
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,400
It's just you and the water.

171
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,160
What? You and the water?

172
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,520
What are you, a surfing guru?
Have you ever even stood on a board?

173
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,440
-Yeah.
-When?

174
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,360
This one time.

175
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,360
Except I spent most of my time
in the water.

176
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,640
Why am I not surprised?

177
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,920
What?

178
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,400
Olo, we have to go.

179
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,440
-Are you crazy? We just got here.
-We have to leave now.

180
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,600
What's up with you?

181
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,200
That's him.

182
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,280
Who?

183
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,680
-Nacho.
-What nachos?

184
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,360
The guy who got me from the ball.
He can't see me.

185
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,920
-Here he comes.
-What?

186
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,560
-Walking towards us.
-Here?

187
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,480
No.

188
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,960
-Oh, wait, he is.
-Let's go.

189
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:08,920
Shush.

190
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,880
-He's with some chick.
-What chick?

191
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,440
-Blonde. Cute. Nice legs…
-What?

192
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,320
She's pretty hot.

193
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,040
-That's his sister Amelia.
-You met his sister?

194
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,280
-What about his mom? Grandma too?
-Stop it.

195
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,560
-Olo, I have to get out of here.
-I'll shield you with my body.

196
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,760
Go, now.

197
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,720
Go, quick.

198
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,840
I don't fucking believe it!

199
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,760
Now tell me everything.
I want every little detail.

200
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,400
Fuck…

201
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,800
Over here!

202
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,360
Where? Hey, Lari. Let's go to the bar.

203
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,600
Well, Olo, that beer
goes really well with your dress.

204
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,400
I've been classy for over an hour now.

205
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,480
This is long overdue.

206
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,640
So bougie!

207
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,320
You coming?

208
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,040
Let go of me, for fuck's sake!
What the hell is this?

209
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,800
Let go of me!

210
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,960
What? That rat!

211
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,960
Mrs. Tortellini
can kiss my ass!

212
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,680
Fuck me.

213
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:12,560
Okay.

214
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,080
Some friend she is.

215
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:22,960
She's out there getting laid,
and she locks me away in a hotel room.

216
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,600
Without a single drop of alcohol!

217
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,360
She'll pay for this.

218
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,600
There we go. There we go.

219
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,760
Fuck! No stairs.

220
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,480
Help!

221
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,680
Goddammit!

222
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,600
Well played.

223
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,120
You managed to lock this tiger in a cage.

224
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,480
Fucking hell.

225
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,720
Have you completely lost
your fucking mind?

226
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:02,160
You've gone crazy
for some dick you hardly know

227
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:04,440
just because he makes you wet?

228
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:07,040
What now, Lari? Hmm?

229
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:12,080
Well? Are you going to break up
your marriage and family for him?

230
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,560
I can't believe it.

231
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,800
You haven't married Domenico yet,

232
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,040
and you're already acting
like a Torricelli.

233
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:22,600
Spare me the bullshit
about family loyalty.

234
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:24,800
What am I supposed to do?

235
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:28,880
Wait until Massimo deals with his shit
and remembers I'm his wife?

236
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:35,120
Who are you looking out for?
Me or yourself?

237
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,640
Just leave me alone.

238
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
I have to figure out what I really want.

239
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,080
You're right.

240
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:02,680
I'm sorry I didn't ask how you're feeling,
or if you need anything.

241
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:13,040
Lari, look at me.

242
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:15,960
Look at me.

243
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:21,800
I love you.

244
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:27,400
I want you to be happy.

245
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,720
Whatever you decide,
I'll support you. You hear me?

246
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,320
I'm just worried.

247
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:42,640
Come here.

248
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,560
Watch out for my snot.

249
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:01,320
Remember, just say the word,
and I'll fucking kill both of them.

250
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:08,040
And I'll find you a nice, calm guy
from a village near Radom, okay?

251
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:10,480
That's right.

252
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,880
What?

253
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,080
You'll grow old and die of boredom.

254
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:26,920
Honey?

255
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,160
Hi, Dad.

256
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:31,560
Hi, sweetie!

257
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,600
I've missed riding with you.

258
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,920
Jesus, Laura, did something happen?

259
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,480
You came here on a motorcycle?

260
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,800
You're gonna give me a heart attack.

261
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:49,680
You know how much I hate your escapades.

262
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,560
Happy to see you too, Mom.

263
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:56,160
Come in. I've got some pork chops.

264
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,000
Of course, you never call ahead.

265
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:04,880
You could have told me you were coming.

266
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,760
I would have prepared.

267
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:10,280
I always have to think on my feet.

268
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,760
Honey, what's going on?

269
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:40,920
What do you mean? Nothing's going on.
I'm just here to visit you.

270
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:44,480
Your mom is convinced
that people buy motorcycles

271
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:47,760
when they're going through
some kind of crisis.

272
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,720
Honey, you'll be 30 soon.

273
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:57,000
If you were okay, you'd be spending
your birthday with your husband,

274
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:59,800
celebrating the anniversary
of your first meeting.

275
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:02,480
-As far as I know--
-I'm in love with someone else.

276
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:14,640
His name is Nacho.

277
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,920
Honey, get me a cigarette.

278
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:23,560
But we agreed
that we wouldn't smoke anymore.

279
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:25,960
Please, bring me a cigarette!

280
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:30,320
All right then.

281
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:25,040
Honey, if you weren't married to Massimo,
who would you choose?

282
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,880
The problem is, I don't know.

283
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:34,000
When you have the answer,
you'll know what to do.

284
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,040
All right…

285
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,400
I'll tell you
a little secret.

286
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:03,360
I think it's what's kept
our marriage alive for 35 years.

287
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:11,000
Remember, a woman
must be selfish in a relationship.

288
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,960
If you put your own happiness first,

289
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:18,080
you'll do whatever it takes
to make it last, right?

290
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:20,840
You will cherish your relationship.

291
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:25,440
But it can't be
a relationship that destroys you.

292
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:32,160
Remember that a woman
who lives only for her man

293
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:35,440
will always be unhappy.

294
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:38,080
Yeah.

295
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,200
And her man will be unhappy too.

296
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,200
Thanks.

297
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:23,000
Ah, my coffee.

298
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:24,800
Okay. No lid for me.

299
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,400
Thank you very much.

300
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:29,920
Thanks. Bye.

301
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:38,160
Coffee for Dad. And for his daughter?

302
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:41,480
-Lemonade.

303
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:49,880
Sometimes I wish
I was still that little girl

304
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,800
you used to take out for lemonade.

305
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:55,320
You'll always be my little girl.

306
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,880
I like spending time with you

307
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:39,720
because I can eat as much as I want
and not feel guilty.

308
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:40,640
Yeah.

309
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:42,200
It's different with Mom.

310
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:43,680
-I've noticed.
-Hmm.

311
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:47,640
There are two things
you never point out to a woman.

312
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:48,560
What things?

313
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:51,280
Her age and the amount of food she eats.

314
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,680
I never knew about the second one.

315
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,320
-You should.
-Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

316
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:01,600
Excuse me.

317
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:07,280
-Just a second. Olga won't stop calling.
-Okay.

318
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:20,640
How's everything?

319
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:21,920
-Good, thanks.
- Great.

320
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:46,520
Hello. Answer my calls,
or I'll have a heart attack.

321
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:48,400
Jeez, Olo, relax. What's up?

322
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,200
You want to know what's up?

323
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:54,520
Massimo knows about everything, Lari.
He knows about you and Nacho!

324
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:56,960
He's gonna kill you,
me, and God knows who else!

325
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:58,600
Um, he told you that?

326
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:02,600
No, I overheard him
talking to Domenico.

327
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:07,080
Um, how did you know
what they were talking about?

328
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:08,400
You don't speak Italian.

329
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,960
Maybe you don't.

330
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:13,400
But I was pissed off
about not understanding, so I learned.

331
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:17,080
Maybe I'm not a fluent speaker,
but I understand everything.

332
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:19,280
You know how to say, "Nacho fucked Laura"?

333
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,280
I guess it's time to go back to Sicily.

334
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:28,680
Are you fucking insane? He knows!

335
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:30,680
Shoot! Fuck knows what he's gonna do!

336
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:32,960
Fuck. I just said, "shoot."

337
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,720
I'd rather him shoot himself
than you or me.

338
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:41,440
Olo, stop. There must be a reason
he hasn't done anything about it yet.

339
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:46,680
Are you even listening to me?
Massimo won't forgive cheating.

340
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:47,840
-Listen.
-Shit.

341
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:51,520
I'm not scared of my own husband.
I won't hide from him.

342
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,000
I'm coming back.

343
01:33:56,160 --> 01:34:02,120
Do what you want.
I'm working on… an escape plan.

344
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,280
Olo, relax. Have a cigarette, okay?

345
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:08,840
What the hell do you think I'm doing?
I can't stop smoking!

346
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,400
Okay, bye.

347
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:26,200
Dad, I have to go back to Sicily.

348
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:27,720
Okay.

349
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:33,240
But first, let's go back to the table.
I ordered some apple pie.

350
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:35,080
Come on.

351
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:51,320
You're here!

352
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:58,240
Okay. I packed just one suitcase.

353
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:01,040
I grabbed your stuff too.
It'll be a quick escape.

354
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:03,280
Why the fuck didn't you call or text?

355
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,320
I would've sent a driver for you.

356
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:08,280
My driver was really nice.

357
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:12,200
Are you serious? Now's not the best time--

358
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:13,280
Fuck.

359
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:21,880
Are you fucking crazy?

360
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:31,800
Have you forgotten your husband's
line of work?

361
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:34,120
Why don't you bring him with you,

362
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:37,560
and I'll look up how to send
a dead body back to Poland?

363
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:54,440
God, it's so sad.
You're going to die on your birthday.

364
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,200
Happy birthday, Lari!

365
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:01,440
If you survive,
I bought you a really nice bag.

366
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,200
If something happens, I'll keep it.

367
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:04,840
-Olo…
-Yeah?

368
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:05,880
Where's Massimo?

369
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:10,960
He went to the beach.

370
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:16,000
-Okay, I'll go find him.
-Really?

371
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:18,360
We need to work things out.

372
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:24,280
And when I get back,
we'll drink to my resurrection, okay?

373
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:28,240
-I have to go now.
-Yeah.

374
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:32,960
-Olo…
-Yeah?

375
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:37,480
-I'm doing this alone.
-Oh yeah, alone. I'll stay here and wait.

376
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:46,400
Fuck…

377
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:02,120
I'll just sit and wait.

378
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,600
Lari will be okay on her own.

379
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:23,480
