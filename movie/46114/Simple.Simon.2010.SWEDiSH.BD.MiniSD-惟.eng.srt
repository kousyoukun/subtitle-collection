1
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:50,791
SIMPLE SIMON

2
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:09,749
I'm in orbit around Earth.

3
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,458
I'm here to gain perspective.

4
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:24,041
I like space.
There are no problems in space.

5
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:27,374
No misunderstandings. No chaos.

6
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:31,749
Because in space,
there are no feelings.

7
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,416
Simon!!!

8
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:47,291
For the last time, get out of there.
I'm not telling you again.

9
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:53,374
Simon, for the very last time,
get out ofthere!

10
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:56,291
Simon!!!

11
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:05,749
Simon, if l offer you 50 kronor,
what do you say?

12
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,624
Sam, you've got to come over.
He's in the barrel.

13
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:18,583
He's been there for eight hours now.

14
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:20,999
Hey...

15
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:27,583
- But I explained it all to him.
- Go ahead and go.

16
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:31,499
- Go, it's fine.
- You sure?

17
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,208
Okay, l'm on my way. Yeah, bye.

18
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:41,833
- You're too nice...
- And you're too hot.

19
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,291
What the hell?
You're in for it, mister!

20
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:51,791
Totally retarded.

21
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:07,208
2,150 - that's my final offer.

22
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:07,499
I can't kill Mom and Dad!

23
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:49,249
- l knew this would happen!
- What are you going to do now?

24
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:04,666
You've got to be kidding...

25
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:20,999
I was talking to my brother,
he's in the barrel.

26
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,541
He's from sp... He thinks...
He's got a space ship.

27
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:40,249
Simon, you can come out now.

28
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:45,499
- lt's okay, Simon.
- She's got to go!

29
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,791
- You want to live here with us.
- No, she's got to go, Sam.

30
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:53,833
You, me, and Frida are going
to live together. Calm down.

31
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:05,583
- This will never work.
- Sure it will.

32
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:11,916
- l'll do everything wrong.
- No. Hey...

33
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:15,708
He just needs to get used to it.

34
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:20,541
- Get used to me getting it wrong?
- No. That you're... you.

35
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:24,041
And you get it wrong sometimes...

36
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,791
What are we going to do?

37
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:31,208
Simon?

38
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,708
If you...
Ifwe're all going to live together,

39
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:54,124
then it's us against the world.
I need Frida.

40
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:58,458
She helps me, just like I help you.
So you need to help her.

41
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:02,124
Nothing will work without her.

42
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:07,499
It's like one of your equations.

43
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:14,708
Remove one of us and there will
be an imbalance. Understand?

44
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:17,124
Einstein?

45
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:31,208
Some people think
I'm an idiot, but I'm not.

46
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:35,374
I just want things
to remain the same.

47
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:39,708
I don't like change,
but I do like Sam.

48
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:43,416
So I've got to make
this equation come out right.

49
00:08:43,417 --> 00:08:48,708
Sam needs Frida like I need Sam.

50
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:53,166
Good, let's go shoot some hoops.

51
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:56,749
Last one down is a square.

52
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:30,708
To help this equation come out right,
I've scheduled our activities.

53
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:36,541
It's designed to make
our lives as simple as possible.

54
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:44,624
Fucking jerk!!

55
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,958
Without the right time,
weight and angle,

56
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,041
we may be thrown off balance.

57
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,291
Don't touch me
I'm Asperger's

58
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:10,874
I prefer circles to humans.
Circles are continuous,

59
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:14,041
while humans are complex
and hard to understand.

60
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:16,999
HAPPY - SAD - ANGRY

61
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,791
TIRED - SURPRlSED - NEUTRAL

62
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:23,333
Ready for breakfast?

63
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,708
See you later...

64
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,708
Sam helps me arrive on time.

65
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,916
Time affects harmony.

66
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:16,833
If you're not on time,
you risk chaos.

67
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:21,749
I'm sorry, are you all right?

68
00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:26,874
- What do you think you're doing?
- Slapping your face.

69
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:31,999
- Yeah... But what for?
- l have Asperger's.

70
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,541
- And that makes it okay to hit people?
- You grabbed my arm.

71
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:39,833
I don't like being touched.

72
00:11:43,084 --> 00:11:46,916
- Let me...
- l'm late.

73
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,749
On time, as usual.

74
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:05,208
I work seven hours a day, five days
a week, thirteen lunar cycles a year.

75
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:08,583
To some people, 13 means bad luck,
but not to me.

76
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:14,541
It's a prime numberi
only divisible by itself. Like me.

77
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:23,833
Attention!
As a team, we have to stick together.

78
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:29,666
Otherwise the whole thingamabob
will just be a big ole mess.

79
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:34,249
I don't have friends.
Feelings just create problems.

80
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:41,791
Take Peter, for instance: Peter likes
Jonna and tries hard to impress her.

81
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:49,083
- ...fall behind...
- Jonna doesn't like Peter, though.

82
00:12:49,084 --> 00:12:56,958
Girls only like guys who don't
like them.

83
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,374
So Jonna's in love with Björn.
"Retard laugh" Björn.

84
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:05,166
But all he likes is to laugh...

85
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:14,083
This is a classic "love triangle"
and it leads to chaos.

86
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,499
I don't like triangles.

87
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,208
We're like brothers.

88
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:22,458
Like brothers and sis...
We're like siblings.

89
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:29,208
Siblings who love each other
and love to work together.

90
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:31,874
And so we just do it.

91
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:35,583
You bastard!

92
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,833
Thank you and goodbye.

93
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:53,166
I'm home!

94
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:00,916
How long do I have?

95
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:05,749
Ten minutes and five seconds, four
seconds, three seconds, two seconds...

96
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,916
- ...one second. Ten minutes.
- Perfect.

97
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:11,499
I have different foods
for different days.

98
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,541
Monday: Sausage and pasta.
Tuesday: Pancakes.

99
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:17,749
Wednesday: Melts.
Thursday: Potato pancakes.

100
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:22,666
Friday: Tacos. Saturday: Pizza.
Sunday: Sam's zucchini special.

101
00:14:33,084 --> 00:14:37,124
Sam cooksi I set and clear the table,
and Frida does the dishes.

102
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:41,708
It's a great setup that gives me
time to practice after dinner.

103
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,916
Hi...

104
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:58,666
Listen, l think l have an STD.

105
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:05,666
- l'm not in the mood...
- Only it's on my face.

106
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,083
You're so not funny!

107
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:13,833
Nice.

108
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:17,624
Hey, why don't we
play some basketball?

109
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:21,499
- Before he comes back.
- l have to do the dishes.

110
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,583
I'll do it later. l promise. Come on...

111
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,374
We'll have ten minutes before he
returns. Maybe you can catch my STD.

112
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:38,166
Come on.

113
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,541
Foul, foul! - Sam, foul.

114
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,666
You just want to shoot penalties.

115
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:05,791
There's no touching in basketball.

116
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:10,208
You put the ball through the hoop.
It's easy,

117
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:14,791
since the hoop's circumference
is 96.5% larger than the ball's.

118
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:18,833
All you have to do is calculate
the velocity, mass and angle.

119
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,166
- Do-over!
- One more time.

120
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:25,999
I'll go do the dishes.

121
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,749
- Another do-over, Sam.
- One more time.

122
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,124
Movie night!

123
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:46,291
This one again?!
It's four hours long.

124
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:49,999
Two hours, 22 minutes,
and 37 seconds.

125
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:56,041
- Can't we watch something on TV?
- No.

126
00:16:56,042 --> 00:17:01,124
- There's a Hugh Grant romcom on.
- Yes...

127
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:04,249
No. In that case
you'll have to watch in your room.

128
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,291
Sure... - Come on.

129
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:19,833
- l'd rather watch the space movie.
- l know.

130
00:17:52,459 --> 00:17:54,791
What the hell...?

131
00:17:56,625 --> 00:18:00,541
We're out oftoilet paper...

132
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:03,499
Get out of here!

133
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,541
- Christ! You're not listening.
- We'll get through this.

134
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:15,458
No, you're just kidding yourself.
This isn't going to work.

135
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:20,124
- What do you want me to do?
- l can't take this crap.

136
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:24,541
I can't kick my own brother out!

137
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:31,833
Isn't that convenient?

138
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:35,583
Frida... Where are you going?

139
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:40,333
Why can't you just shut up?!

140
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:44,583
Stop playing, you fucking psycho!

141
00:18:44,584 --> 00:18:47,791
Don't touch him!

142
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,291
- Don't go! Please?
- Fuck off!

143
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:03,499
- Leave me alone.
- l want to be with you.

144
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:10,208
- No, you want to be with your brother.
- He needs me, just like I need you.

145
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:15,458
Please don't go.

146
00:19:24,584 --> 00:19:29,416
She left, but at least now
it'll be nice and quiet.

147
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,999
Simon?

148
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:02,874
It's not your fault.
She didn't mean what she said.

149
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:06,041
She'll come back, she always does.

150
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:11,374
Don't be sad. Okay?

151
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,999
It's important
to maintain the correct orbit.

152
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,541
If you go too fast,
you'll be hurled out in space.

153
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:30,458
Too slow, and you spiral
downwards... and crash.

154
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:36,624
If you cannot maintain orbit,
you end up with chaos.

155
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:40,208
So I have to maintain orbit.

156
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,499
Shit...

157
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,708
Wake up, we're late.

158
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:07,416
Sam, it's my turn to shower!

159
00:21:07,417 --> 00:21:13,416
I'm three minutes and seventeen
seconds late. 18, 19, 20, 21 ...

160
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:16,749
...22, 23, 24.

161
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:33,541
Where is Frida?
You said that she'd be back.

162
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,749
- Then l guess she will.
- Do you promise, Sam?

163
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,541
Absolutely. Now hurry up, we're late.

164
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:49,458
- l'll be late.
- Get off, it won't start.

165
00:21:57,459 --> 00:21:59,916
- Are you angry?
- No!

166
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:12,416
People can't be trusted. They say
one thing and mean another.

167
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:16,041
This won't hurt a bit.

168
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:19,249
I'm Sweden's best dart player.

169
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:22,583
- Are you angry?
- No!

170
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,166
I can get angry too,
when I can't keep to schedule.

171
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:31,166
Because I don't like change.

172
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,124
What's going on, Simon?

173
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:49,083
- ls the world coming to an end?
- Yes.

174
00:22:49,084 --> 00:22:54,333
In about five billions years, the earth
will be swallowed up by the sun.

175
00:22:56,709 --> 00:23:03,291
"One time is no time",
as the saying goes.

176
00:23:03,292 --> 00:23:08,124
No, one time is one time.

177
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:13,333
Well, you'll have to start
with No. 42 in the meantime.

178
00:23:13,334 --> 00:23:15,791
Go on, time is money.

179
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:19,958
Time isn't money.
Time is time. Money is money.

180
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:28,374
I don't like people saying
things are what they're not.

181
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:32,458
Sam is the only person I trust.
He means what he says.

182
00:23:32,459 --> 00:23:37,124
If he says Frida will come back,
she will.

183
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:44,958
Hello?

184
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:47,124
Hi!

185
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,583
Hi, how are you?

186
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:53,958
Yeah...

187
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:56,541
You're moving out?

188
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:32,708
I'm home.

189
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:40,791
Sam?

190
00:24:57,917 --> 00:25:02,666
- Dinner was 20 minutes ago, Sam.
- l haven't had time to make any.

191
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:08,666
- Tacos, today is tacos.
- Know what? Let's have pizza.

192
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:12,874
- No, it's not pizza day.
- lt'll be fine.

193
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:15,749
- Where is Frida?
- She's not coming back.

194
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,749
- She always comes back.
- No. She's moved out.

195
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:24,666
- You said that she would.
- l guess l was wrong.

196
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:29,958
- l'd like to order two pizzas...
- Sam... Sam!

197
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:33,208
Who's doing the dishes?

198
00:25:33,209 --> 00:25:35,291
I set the table, you cook,
she does the dishes.

199
00:25:35,292 --> 00:25:38,583
She's gone, you blockhead!

200
00:25:38,584 --> 00:25:44,708
- No, l didn't mean you.
- Who's going to do the dishes, Sam?

201
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:48,541
We're having pizza. No one
needs to do any damn dishes!

202
00:25:48,542 --> 00:25:51,833
I don't want pizza!

203
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,833
She's not coming back.

204
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:08,708
Sure she is,
she has to do the dishes!

205
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:14,708
She's not going to do the dishes
anymore. She won't rent movies,

206
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:18,416
play basketball, or do this or that...

207
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:23,541
She won't be doing
anything anymore. Get it?

208
00:26:33,042 --> 00:26:36,624
Besides, she isn't right for us anyway.

209
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:41,374
She's too pedantic. She eats those
disgusting fish paste sandwiches.

210
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:44,291
She doesn't make any noise
when we have sex.

211
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:50,583
She's selfish and she doesn't get me.
But she wears that butt-ugly hat.

212
00:26:50,584 --> 00:26:55,916
That ugly, fucking Frida hat!

213
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:02,208
Simon?

214
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:25,749
- Hi, it's me, Simon.
- What are you doing here?

215
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,249
- l don't want pizza on a Friday.
- Sorry, I can't help you.

216
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:34,249
- You have to come back.
- No, l don't. Goodbye, Simon.

217
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:50,958
Hi, it's me. All you have to do is
change and everything will be fine.

218
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:54,916
You're pedantic, you don't
make noise when you have sex...

219
00:27:54,917 --> 00:27:57,749
- Who do you think you are?
- l'm Simon.

220
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:03,708
It's your fault it's not fine!
You have to change.

221
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:16,541
- Hi...
- l'll call the police!

222
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:21,416
- l can't change, but you can.
- l don't want to!

223
00:28:21,417 --> 00:28:25,333
Find some other damn girl
who can stand living with you!

224
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:30,708
Some other damn girl?

225
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:36,208
You may be a wiz at physics,
but you suck at playing the drums.

226
00:28:36,209 --> 00:28:40,874
- Just so you know.
- l do know.

227
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:43,958
That's why I need to practice!

228
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:51,666
I'm home.

229
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:55,708
- Where have you been?
- We have to find some other damn girl.

230
00:28:55,709 --> 00:28:58,041
What are you talking about?

231
00:28:58,042 --> 00:29:02,874
If Frida won't come back, I'll have
to find some other damn girl.

232
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:07,916
A girl who doesn't fight,
a girl who is just like Sam.

233
00:29:07,917 --> 00:29:14,208
No one knows Sam betterthan me,
and I can look at it scientifically.

234
00:29:14,209 --> 00:29:16,416
Sam: Cooks - Girl: Does dishes

235
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:20,749
Hi...

236
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:24,499
Hello...

237
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:30,583
- Hey...
- You're three minutes late.

238
00:29:30,584 --> 00:29:34,083
- Do l look like a bus driver to you?
- Yes.

239
00:29:34,084 --> 00:29:37,333
You drive a bus
and wear a bus driver's uniform.

240
00:29:37,334 --> 00:29:43,916
It may look like that,
but that's not really what I am.

241
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:48,916
Eight years of cooking school.
Chef at the city's best restaurant.

242
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:55,666
For what? People want fast food.
Instant this or that...

243
00:29:55,667 --> 00:30:01,749
Everything in an instant.
You can't hurry an excellent sauce.

244
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:05,541
It's like my old saucier,
Gaston, used to say...

245
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,458
Or something. I don't speak French.

246
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:17,999
A great sauce takes time, just like love.

247
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:35,458
Hi, Mom. - Hi, Dad.

248
00:30:53,042 --> 00:30:56,333
- Bye, Mom. - Bye, Dad.
- Simon?

249
00:30:56,334 --> 00:31:01,666
- What are you doing with that camera?
- Finding Sam a new girlfriend.

250
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:05,749
- What's wrong with Frida?
- They broke up.

251
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:09,833
- Why did they break up?
- She won't change.

252
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:15,041
So l have to find some other damn girl
who can stand living with me.

253
00:31:18,584 --> 00:31:21,374
What a shame.

254
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:28,541
Finish with a pinch of nutmeg.
Dip the tip of a knife in, that's all.

255
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:31,249
Une petite La knife... whatever.

256
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:37,666
Bitterness has its place in every
sauce, just like in life itself.

257
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:44,583
- You can't do anything about it.
- I'm home.

258
00:31:44,584 --> 00:31:50,416
It'll never work, Mom.
Moving back home would kill him.

259
00:31:53,209 --> 00:31:58,166
I've got to go,
I'm doing the laundry.

260
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:01,874
Right, busy bees. Bye.

261
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:06,583
We do our laundry
6:30 - 9 pm on Fridays.

262
00:32:06,584 --> 00:32:10,499
- Yeah, I lied.
- Oh.

263
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:18,666
- Who the hell watches "Lassie"?
- You're watching "Lassie".

264
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:21,833
Don't you like dogs?

265
00:32:21,834 --> 00:32:26,291
- Don't you like dogs?
- No.

266
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:36,041
Facts about Sam: Sam is 23
and does not generate chaos.

267
00:32:36,042 --> 00:32:39,291
Sam likes Simon, cooking,
and black licorice.

268
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:42,166
Sam dislikes dogs, mustard and math.

269
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:44,416
- What deduction?
- Done!

270
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:49,833
To find a new girl for Sam, I need
13 questions that reveal who Sam is.

271
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:54,499
Then I have to find a new girl
who fits in with his responses.

272
00:32:55,459 --> 00:32:59,041
I'm going to find
the perfect girl for Sam.

273
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:10,999
- Sorry. Oh, It's you again.
- l always pass this spot at 8:55 am.

274
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,499
- Gee, I thought it was destiny.
- There is no such thing.

275
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:21,208
- lt's only make-believe.
- lt's good to blame stuff on.

276
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:25,708
It's all mathematics and determinism.
Can l ask you some questions?

277
00:33:25,709 --> 00:33:29,958
- Sure, what?
- Romantic comedies or sci-fi?

278
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:32,958
I don't watch that many movies.

279
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:37,916
- Dogs or cats?
- Dogs... and cats.

280
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:41,083
- Do you make noise during sex?
- What?!

281
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:44,708
- Do you make noise during sex?
- Do you?

282
00:33:44,709 --> 00:33:47,291
No, I don't have sex!

283
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:51,041
Oh, sorry. - Hello? Hi...

284
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:57,083
Out and about...

285
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:06,583
I see... Oh well.

286
00:34:06,584 --> 00:34:11,749
No, it's cool.

287
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,624
Okay, great. Bye.

288
00:34:18,917 --> 00:34:23,958
Are you sad? Your mouth went from
a happy mouth to a sad mouth.

289
00:34:23,959 --> 00:34:29,749
- Have any more questions?
- No, you gave me the wrong answers.

290
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:34,791
I didn't know there were
any wrong answers there.

291
00:34:40,917 --> 00:34:42,874
- Do you make noise during sex?
- Sometimes.

292
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:44,874
- Yes.
- l don't know.

293
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:47,999
Can you do dishes, yes or no?

294
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,708
- Train or bus?
- Train.

295
00:34:50,709 --> 00:34:52,624
Ketchup or mustard?

296
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:59,874
- Ketchup or mustard?
- Which do you want?

297
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:05,416
Jeez, take both!
We're waiting in line here!

298
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:19,374
- Do you like Simon?
- Who's Simon?

299
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:21,749
- Yes.
- Don't know...

300
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,624
- Sports: yes or no?
- No.

301
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:26,666
Licorice or fruit-flavored candy?
Dogs or cats?

302
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:29,999
- lt's not a dog, it's a Great Dane.
- Wrong.

303
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,541
Finding the perfect girl
isn't as easy as you might think.

304
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:36,666
They always get one wrong.

305
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:40,208
- Licorice or fruit-flavored candy?
- Fruit.

306
00:35:40,209 --> 00:35:44,166
I hate the way licorice
gets stuck in my teeth.

307
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:46,874
Equations need careful consideration.

308
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:50,208
And love, like a good sauce,
takes time.

309
00:36:02,625 --> 00:36:06,708
Hi, Simon.
I brought you some breakfast.

310
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:21,499
Can't you come and live with us?
So that Sam gets some peace.

311
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:28,249
- Just until everything's worked out.
- l'm going to work things out for Sam.

312
00:36:41,584 --> 00:36:47,499
Simon? Don't you want me
to help you with breakfast?

313
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,708
And we could talk about this.

314
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:55,958
Hello? Are you there?

315
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:15,458
- Can you do dishes? Yes or no.
- No.

316
00:37:15,459 --> 00:37:21,874
Can you see yourself dating someone
who is scientifically perfect for you?

317
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:25,583
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

318
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:40,874
Romantic comedies or sci-fi?

319
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:46,999
If it doesn't contain violence
or blood, l'm not interested.

320
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,916
When bodily fluids flow
or limbs are torn off, l feel...

321
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:57,624
- Romantic comedies or sci-fi?
- Sci-fi. But l prefer action.

322
00:37:57,625 --> 00:38:01,291
- Dogs or cats?
- l don't like dogs. Cats!

323
00:38:01,292 --> 00:38:03,874
Don't yell.

324
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:06,958
- Do you like Simon?
- No.

325
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:09,833
I think you're an idiot.

326
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:17,249
- Could I ask you 13 questions?
- Okay...

327
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,916
- Can you do dishes? Yes or no.
- Yes.

328
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:26,166
Good. Would you date someone
who is scientifically perfect for you?

329
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:29,166
Absolutely. Yes.

330
00:38:31,334 --> 00:38:34,874
Great, let me just take your picture.

331
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:38,208
Look as attractive as possible.

332
00:38:38,209 --> 00:38:41,916
No, attractive!

333
00:38:41,917 --> 00:38:44,374
More attractive!

334
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:50,708
Perfect. You can go now, if you want.

335
00:38:52,042 --> 00:38:54,083
Bye.

336
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:35,958
- What's this?
- Possible girlfriends.

337
00:39:42,917 --> 00:39:49,041
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Find a girlfriend.

338
00:39:49,042 --> 00:39:56,333
- Number 13 is perfect for you.
- That's not how it works.

339
00:39:56,334 --> 00:39:59,541
The ones at the back
got the most right.

340
00:39:59,542 --> 00:40:04,166
Number 13 is exactly like you:
"Sci-fi or Romcom?" Sci-Fi.

341
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:09,333
- "Cats or dogs?" Cats...
- There are no right answers.

342
00:40:09,334 --> 00:40:13,124
It's about feelings.

343
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:17,624
I'm more likely to fall in love with
someone who's the complete opposite.

344
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:24,999
It would suck to be with someone who
is exactly like me. Don't you think?

345
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:29,083
No...

346
00:40:30,334 --> 00:40:32,874
I don't understand.

347
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:44,249
Come on.

348
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:53,291
Look...

349
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:59,499
Just like the same poles
of a magnet repel each other,

350
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:05,041
people who are too similar
can also repel each other.

351
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:10,708
And just like the opposite poles
of a magnet attract each other...

352
00:41:10,709 --> 00:41:14,833
...people who are different
can be drawn to each other.

353
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:21,249
Like us. We're different,
but we like each other.

354
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:26,958
Stop it with the equations.
Whatever happens, happens...

355
00:42:26,584 --> 00:42:30,666
What the hell are you doing?
Watch out.

356
00:42:36,959 --> 00:42:42,958
- Oh, look who's here...
- Yes, and it's all your fault.

357
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:46,083
- Why?
- l was supposed to run into you.

358
00:42:46,084 --> 00:42:49,083
So we could talk.
But you weren't on time.

359
00:42:49,084 --> 00:42:53,124
We don't have to run into each other
to talk, do we?

360
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:58,916
You have to meet my brother.
Do you want to?

361
00:42:58,917 --> 00:43:03,374
- You're each other's opposites.
- We are?

362
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:08,291
He's not like me,
he doesn't have Asperger's.

363
00:43:08,292 --> 00:43:12,166
He's 937 times better than I am.
Want to meet him?

364
00:43:12,167 --> 00:43:16,833
- l don't know if I want to.
- What?

365
00:43:16,834 --> 00:43:22,958
It feels kind ofweird,
I don't even know you.

366
00:43:22,959 --> 00:43:29,541
If you two fall in love you'll get to
know me. You'll see me all the time.

367
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:35,541
Yeah. But the thing is...

368
00:43:35,542 --> 00:43:39,958
We've only run into each other
a few times.

369
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:43,333
- l don't even know your name.
- l'm Simon.

370
00:43:43,334 --> 00:43:46,541
- Now you know my name.
- Hello, Simon.

371
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:50,958
- l'm Jennifer.
- l don't like touching people.

372
00:43:50,959 --> 00:43:53,624
I forgot, sorry.

373
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:57,958
Hi there... l completely forgot.

374
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:07,958
What are you looking at?

375
00:44:07,959 --> 00:44:13,499
- You look really tired.
- l know, I was out all night.

376
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,916
Was there anything else? I have to go.

377
00:44:16,917 --> 00:44:22,124
- So do you want to meet my brother?
- This is going too fast...

378
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:26,208
- Do you want to?
- l can't decide just like that.

379
00:44:26,209 --> 00:44:30,666
- l need to know now.
- l'm still drunk, don't pressure me.

380
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:35,541
- l have to think about it.
- But I need to know now.

381
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,833
I feel that our discipline
isn't up to par.

382
00:44:52,834 --> 00:44:58,041
People are tardy, there's a lot
of hullabaloo and high jinks.

383
00:44:58,042 --> 00:45:02,124
I don't want any more
rule breaking and... who are you?

384
00:45:06,084 --> 00:45:10,208
Hello. Well, l'm here to have a look.

385
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:16,708
- Oh, you're Simon's guardian?
- That's right.

386
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:27,999
The rest of us will
continue with our regular duties...

387
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,166
Just like any other day.

388
00:45:59,917 --> 00:46:04,791
You do this every day?
Don't you get bored?

389
00:46:04,792 --> 00:46:09,083
Not every day. Monday through Friday,
9 am to 5 pm, lunch 12 to 1 .

390
00:46:09,084 --> 00:46:12,833
Right, isn't it lunch time soon?
I'm starving.

391
00:46:12,834 --> 00:46:17,749
Lunch time is in 22 minutes
and 13 seconds. 12, 1 1 ...

392
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:21,833
- ...10, 9...
- Give me that watch.

393
00:46:21,834 --> 00:46:25,291
- Hand it over!
- Why?

394
00:46:25,292 --> 00:46:27,749
Give it to me!

395
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:33,458
Thanks.

396
00:46:33,459 --> 00:46:38,499
- What are you doing?
- Time sure flies, it's lunch time.

397
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,874
That's impossible, you're lying.

398
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:45,708
Come on, Simon, let's get some lunch.

399
00:46:47,667 --> 00:46:52,166
VA squared equals G0,
times R0 squared divided by RA

400
00:46:52,167 --> 00:46:55,208
times 2RP divided by RA plus RP

401
00:46:55,209 --> 00:46:59,458
where G0 is equal to the surface
gravitational acceleration...

402
00:46:59,459 --> 00:47:02,749
- What's that about?
- Space and time.

403
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:08,541
Don't be so hung up on time or
nothing unexpected will ever happen.

404
00:47:08,542 --> 00:47:11,416
I don't like unexpected things.

405
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:16,166
You're going to like this.

406
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,666
- ls it drums? Space sounds?
- No, just listen.

407
00:47:24,667 --> 00:47:29,166
- ls it emotional? I don't like that.
- Just take the earpiece.

408
00:47:36,875 --> 00:47:42,916
I always sync everything I see
so that it's in time to the music.

409
00:47:42,917 --> 00:47:47,458
- Like a music video in my head.
- l don't understand.

410
00:47:47,459 --> 00:47:51,916
You know that feeling
that the world revolves around you.

411
00:47:51,917 --> 00:47:57,541
It's almost as if the world
adapts itself to your music.

412
00:47:57,542 --> 00:48:01,416
- Simple.
- l don't know that feeling.

413
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:04,833
- Listen to this.
- l can't hear anything.

414
00:48:04,834 --> 00:48:08,833
- l can hear it now.
- Okay.

415
00:48:49,042 --> 00:48:51,749
Isn't that adorable?

416
00:48:52,792 --> 00:48:56,708
- What are you doing?
- You touched me!

417
00:48:56,709 --> 00:49:00,666
Sorry, l forgot.

418
00:49:00,667 --> 00:49:05,291
- l have to go back to work now.
- No you don't.

419
00:49:05,292 --> 00:49:09,999
I have the watch,
and l say it's still lunch time.

420
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:16,833
- All right, but don't touch me!
- Okay, I promise l won't.

421
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:20,833
Simon?

422
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:26,874
- Don't touch me!
- Sorry, I forgot.

423
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:29,083
Come on...

424
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,208
- Don't touch me!
- Watch it!

425
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,583
Don't touch me!

426
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:54,166
Simon?! What are you doing?

427
00:49:55,667 --> 00:50:01,041
- You always wear the same clothes.
- This shirt is comfortable.

428
00:50:01,042 --> 00:50:06,708
- And it's red and blue.
- l think I like all colors.

429
00:50:06,709 --> 00:50:09,999
- l don't like brown.
- No, a manhole!

430
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,708
- You touched me again.
- Manhole covers bring bad luck!

431
00:50:13,709 --> 00:50:17,374
- lt's round, l like round.
- But it's brown.

432
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:21,083
Do you like round things
even if they're brown?

433
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:25,041
Wrap your head around that!

434
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,791
I like that it's round,
but not that it's brown.

435
00:50:33,834 --> 00:50:37,041
Please come in, this is my place.

436
00:50:37,042 --> 00:50:40,208
Make yourself at home.

437
00:50:43,084 --> 00:50:45,333
Beep-beep...

438
00:50:47,209 --> 00:50:51,666
- Why is it so messy?
- lt's not, l just have a lot of stuff.

439
00:50:51,667 --> 00:50:57,958
- Why are your records so old?
- You should talk, Mr. Polaroid.

440
00:50:57,959 --> 00:51:02,208
Scoot... My fish. And the flowers.

441
00:51:04,167 --> 00:51:10,208
- Why do you have two television sets?
- lf that one breaks, l've got this.

442
00:51:11,625 --> 00:51:15,541
- Why do you have bagpipes?
- Why do you ask so many questions?

443
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:18,916
So that l can get to know you.

444
00:51:18,917 --> 00:51:21,333
To see if your brother
and l are compatible?

445
00:51:21,334 --> 00:51:25,083
No, to make sure you aren't,
so you can be together.

446
00:51:25,084 --> 00:51:29,791
Like magnets. Opposites attract.

447
00:51:29,792 --> 00:51:33,874
I've never met anyone like you.

448
00:51:40,542 --> 00:51:45,749
- A good sauce is what's important.
- What goes in the sauce?

449
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:49,249
Go for a red wine sauce,
that always works.

450
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:53,499
Sam. What do you mean, "missing"?

451
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:59,291
Well, he's been late all week.
And today, third day in a row...

452
00:51:59,292 --> 00:52:04,791
He brought some girl along
and now he's just up and disappeared.

453
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:08,291
- What girl?
- His guardian.

454
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:13,374
- l'm his guardian.
- How am I supposed to remember that?

455
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:17,083
I thought it was
one of your girlfriends.

456
00:52:17,084 --> 00:52:22,041
- l had the same girl for five years.
- Is this about your girlfriend?

457
00:52:22,042 --> 00:52:27,041
- l don't have one, we broke up.
- What a shame.

458
00:52:27,042 --> 00:52:32,333
- Where is Simon?
- That's the thing.

459
00:52:32,334 --> 00:52:36,624
- l don't know. He's gone.
- ldiot ...

460
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:39,624
Idiot ...

461
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:42,083
Right...

462
00:52:51,417 --> 00:52:55,166
Hello... Excuse me?

463
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:58,208
- Hi, have you seen Simon?
- No.

464
00:52:58,209 --> 00:53:01,833
Was he here this morn... Hey?

465
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:08,458
Could you turn that thing off?!
Stop blowing!

466
00:53:08,459 --> 00:53:11,166
Get it out of here!

467
00:53:12,459 --> 00:53:16,083
Was he... Hello?

468
00:53:16,084 --> 00:53:19,291
You have to stop!

469
00:53:21,667 --> 00:53:24,791
- Get off!
- Lie still.

470
00:53:24,792 --> 00:53:26,458
Get off!

471
00:53:26,459 --> 00:53:30,166
He's cross-eyed,
never smiles, wears red and blue...

472
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:34,833
- ...walks all stiff. Name's Simon.
- l'll find him.

473
00:53:34,834 --> 00:53:42,166
- Should I file a report?
- Nah, I'll remember...

474
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:56,499
- Sorry I left you alone. ls it okay?
- Yes, l like being alone.

475
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:02,041
Do you? Me too.
But only when I choose to be alone.

476
00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:05,166
I generally choose
to be with someone, though.

477
00:54:05,167 --> 00:54:10,583
- l don't need to be alone, l have Sam.
- Right.

478
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:17,749
- Nice, huh? Just like you.
- No, notjust like me.

479
00:54:19,209 --> 00:54:21,708
Your colors.

480
00:54:21,709 --> 00:54:25,083
Yes, red and blue.

481
00:54:25,084 --> 00:54:28,999
And here are some melts.

482
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,999
- You have to make them round.
- You've said so a thousand times.

483
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,916
No, five times. Who is it?

484
00:54:36,917 --> 00:54:39,958
Right, it's "mini-Saturday".

485
00:54:39,959 --> 00:54:43,499
No, it's Wednesday.
Today is Wednesday, Jennifer!

486
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:47,916
- Hi!
- Hi, honey.

487
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:50,583
How are you?

488
00:54:50,584 --> 00:54:54,416
So here you are.

489
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:56,708
I'd kind offorgotten...

490
00:54:56,709 --> 00:55:02,083
This is Simon. He can't touch anyone!

491
00:55:02,084 --> 00:55:05,583
- Hi, I'm Clara.
- What's with the Nazi salute?

492
00:55:05,584 --> 00:55:08,624
I'm Simon and I'm Asperger's.

493
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:12,208
That's why people can't touch me.

494
00:55:12,209 --> 00:55:17,416
- ls he your boyfriend?
- No, absolutely not.

495
00:55:17,417 --> 00:55:20,333
- What did you bring?
- Tequila!

496
00:55:20,334 --> 00:55:23,041
Pictionary!

497
00:55:23,042 --> 00:55:25,333
Come on, Simon.

498
00:55:25,334 --> 00:55:29,374
Let's play.
Ever play Tequila Pictionary?

499
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:32,916
It's really easy...

500
00:55:34,084 --> 00:55:38,583
- Do you want one?
- l told you, they have to be round.

501
00:55:38,584 --> 00:55:44,708
- The crusts are the best part.
- There are glasses under there.

502
00:55:44,709 --> 00:55:47,166
Right there, grab them.

503
00:55:47,167 --> 00:55:53,416
- All right if l help myself?
- Sure. - Melt, Simon?

504
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:01,999
An ice cream!

505
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:10,333
Grass.

506
00:56:10,334 --> 00:56:14,333
A palm tree. I was first.

507
00:56:15,084 --> 00:56:16,583
I was first.

508
00:56:31,167 --> 00:56:36,499
Hi, Mom. Just wondered
if Simon was there.

509
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,874
No, don't worry,
he'll find his way home.

510
00:56:39,875 --> 00:56:43,791
I am calm. Yes, l'm calm.

511
00:56:43,792 --> 00:56:46,666
Bye.

512
00:56:51,292 --> 00:56:55,833
- A ball.
- The moon, the sun...

513
00:56:55,834 --> 00:56:59,291
A pizza?

514
00:56:59,292 --> 00:57:01,499
Venus, Jupiter.

515
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,124
A rock, with two... balls!

516
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:09,583
These are also supposed
to be completely round.

517
00:57:09,584 --> 00:57:13,666
- Time's up.
- What is it?

518
00:57:13,667 --> 00:57:16,541
It's water, can't you tell?

519
00:57:16,542 --> 00:57:21,749
Oxygen and two hydrogen atoms.

520
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:24,749
You are seriously disturbed!

521
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:29,624
- That's not water.
- You could draw an island, waves...

522
00:57:29,625 --> 00:57:37,208
- lt doesn't have to be so advanced.
- Penalty shot.

523
00:57:37,209 --> 00:57:39,916
Penalty, penalty...

524
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:48,749
What did he do?

525
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:02,833
Why are you sitting out here?
Are you sad?

526
00:58:02,834 --> 00:58:08,374
- What makes you think that?
- You look sad.

527
00:58:08,375 --> 00:58:13,208
Sometimes people look sad
even though they're happy.

528
00:58:13,209 --> 00:58:18,291
Once, when Sam was picked
Most Valuable Player, my mom cried.

529
00:58:18,292 --> 00:58:21,333
But she was happy.

530
00:58:21,334 --> 00:58:24,624
But she still cried.

531
00:58:25,334 --> 00:58:29,083
- Right.
- You're not sad anymore?

532
00:58:29,084 --> 00:58:36,416
- lt's not that simple, Simon.
- lt is. Either you're sad or happy.

533
00:58:36,417 --> 00:58:38,958
No.

534
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:47,833
I'm sad about someone who used to
make me so happy, who's an idiot.

535
00:58:47,834 --> 00:58:54,666
You have to replace him with
a new quantity, like in an equation.

536
00:58:58,209 --> 00:59:00,124
Are you happy?

537
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:06,249
I'm happy l'm out here with you.

538
00:59:09,667 --> 00:59:15,124
- l don't understand.
- l like you.

539
00:59:15,125 --> 00:59:20,666
Not that. How can you go
from happy to sad like that?

540
00:59:24,667 --> 00:59:32,541
Imagine that you have
a circle, like this. Round.

541
00:59:32,542 --> 00:59:38,291
And up here, at the top,
is the saddest you can get.

542
00:59:38,292 --> 00:59:44,999
Then you're less sad.
You're almost okay. You're fine.

543
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:50,499
You're happy, psyched,
almost in a state of euphoria,

544
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:56,291
and then just insanely happy
when you reach the top.

545
00:59:56,292 --> 01:00:02,291
On the other side of sad.
It's like it couldn't get any better.

546
01:00:02,292 --> 01:00:09,166
But it's so easy to tip
over the edge and go sad.

547
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:16,749
- l understand.
- You do?

548
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:20,583
Yes. Someone you liked
stopped liking you,

549
01:00:20,584 --> 01:00:23,666
and that made you
tip over to the other side.

550
01:00:23,667 --> 01:00:27,541
Tip over from happy to sad.

551
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:33,916
You explain things so l understand.
Only you and Sam do that.

552
01:00:33,917 --> 01:00:40,166
- Good, maybe we're not all different.
- You are. He's order, you're chaos.

553
01:00:40,167 --> 01:00:43,874
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

554
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:50,333
Just so you know,
I can only fall for good-looking guys.

555
01:00:50,334 --> 01:00:53,208
Hold on.

556
01:00:54,542 --> 01:00:57,124
- Here.
- Who's that?

557
01:00:57,125 --> 01:01:00,958
My brother Sam.
Is he good-looking or not?

558
01:01:03,084 --> 01:01:06,249
- Possibly...
- You think so?

559
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:10,083
Because if you do,
you can meet him.

560
01:01:15,542 --> 01:01:22,958
Let's ask Lisa and Clara.

561
01:02:12,917 --> 01:02:15,958
Hello...

562
01:02:15,959 --> 01:02:19,416
- How are you?
- Fine.

563
01:02:19,417 --> 01:02:23,791
- What are you doing here?
- Simon has disappeared.

564
01:02:23,792 --> 01:02:28,416
- l see.
- Have you heard anything?

565
01:02:28,417 --> 01:02:30,541
No, sorry.

566
01:02:41,917 --> 01:02:44,916
- Sorry, but...
- What do you want?

567
01:02:44,917 --> 01:02:47,916
It might have something to do with you.

568
01:02:47,917 --> 01:02:51,624
- That's not my problem, right?
- Yes... or no. l don't know.

569
01:02:51,625 --> 01:02:56,583
I don't know what to do about you,
or about us...

570
01:02:56,584 --> 01:02:59,541
There is no "us" anymore.

571
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:04,458
Easy for you to say. You were just
looking for a reason to break it off

572
01:03:04,459 --> 01:03:07,208
so you could meet new guys.

573
01:03:07,209 --> 01:03:10,874
You're the one in a relationship
with your brother.

574
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:15,374
Come back when you've got
something better to offer.

575
01:03:18,792 --> 01:03:23,083
The shirt is kind of...
But that can be changed.

576
01:03:23,084 --> 01:03:26,083
Are you in love with him now?

577
01:03:26,084 --> 01:03:29,624
You can't fall in love with a picture.

578
01:03:29,625 --> 01:03:32,499
- Yes you can.
- No, lt doesn't work like that.

579
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:36,166
You have to click, like in the movies.

580
01:03:36,167 --> 01:03:41,666
I don't watch romantic movies.
Do you want to meet him?

581
01:03:41,667 --> 01:03:46,083
What's this?
"l'm Sam, Simon's big brother."

582
01:03:46,084 --> 01:03:50,916
"lf you're reading this, he's probably
lost or gotten into trouble."

583
01:03:50,917 --> 01:03:54,749
"lt's not his fault,
he has Asperger's."

584
01:03:54,750 --> 01:04:00,374
"Call me and l'll come pick him up
and fix whatever he broke."

585
01:04:00,375 --> 01:04:05,708
- How sweet!
- Do you want to meet him now?

586
01:04:05,709 --> 01:04:08,416
- No...
- You want to.

587
01:04:08,417 --> 01:04:11,833
- Yes...
- You said yes.

588
01:04:11,834 --> 01:04:15,666
- l don't know. Where are you going?
- Home to Sam.

589
01:04:15,667 --> 01:04:22,499
- What about me?
- You're going on a date.

590
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:27,374
- Simon!
- He's cute... really sweet.

591
01:04:43,584 --> 01:04:46,166
I'm home.

592
01:04:52,417 --> 01:04:57,416
- Where were you? l was worried.
- l've been with Jennifer.

593
01:04:57,417 --> 01:05:01,958
- Who?
- Your new girlfriend.

594
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,333
Sam? She's your total opposite.

595
01:05:09,334 --> 01:05:11,874
She explains things so l understand.

596
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:15,916
- Apart from that, you're opposites.
- l don't want to meet her.

597
01:05:15,917 --> 01:05:19,291
You need someone who does
the dishes and who likes me.

598
01:05:19,292 --> 01:05:23,958
- She likes me, so she'll love you.
- l want to be alone.

599
01:05:23,959 --> 01:05:29,874
You didn't call all day!
Don't you realize how worried l was?

600
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:36,791
- She wants to go on a date with you.
- l don't want to see anyone.

601
01:05:36,792 --> 01:05:40,333
- ls that so hard to understand?
- Where are you going?

602
01:05:40,334 --> 01:05:43,499
- To Mom and Dad's.
- Why?

603
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:46,833
- Because.
- Are you angry, Sam?

604
01:05:46,834 --> 01:05:51,708
- You sound like you're Asperger's.
- Butt out ofthis!

605
01:05:51,709 --> 01:05:57,291
You can't even take care of yourself!
Can't you see how upset l am?

606
01:05:57,292 --> 01:06:03,666
No, you can't because you're
the one with Asperger's, you idiot!

607
01:06:03,667 --> 01:06:06,916
You're yelling, Sam. Sam!

608
01:06:06,917 --> 01:06:12,333
- Don't touch me!
- Sam? Sam...

609
01:06:12,334 --> 01:06:14,958
Sam! Sam! Sam!

610
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,958
I'm an idiot!

611
01:08:53,709 --> 01:08:57,958
It was so obvious...
They're opposites!

612
01:08:57,959 --> 01:09:02,333
So if Jennif er wants to go on a date,
then Sam won't want to.

613
01:09:02,334 --> 01:09:04,874
I have to complete my mission.

614
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:10,416
If you get the magnets close enough,
science will take care ofthe rest.

615
01:09:13,875 --> 01:09:19,624
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

616
01:09:21,917 --> 01:09:25,749
I want every single movie there is
about two people falling in love.

617
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:29,374
- All of Hugh Grant's movies.
- All ofthem...?

618
01:09:43,167 --> 01:09:47,708
Great, I've got an incoming call.

619
01:09:47,709 --> 01:09:51,499
Hi, chef.
I'm in need of some catering.

620
01:09:54,250 --> 01:10:00,208
Team, we have to stick together.
I chose you because I believe in you.

621
01:10:00,209 --> 01:10:03,833
That, and you're the only people
I know. Will you tempt fate?

622
01:10:03,834 --> 01:10:07,416
Will you help me?

623
01:10:07,417 --> 01:10:09,374
Synchronize!

624
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:17,666
Good... Just like in a Romcom.

625
01:10:20,167 --> 01:10:24,749
- Not until 10 pm on the dot.
- l have to practice.

626
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:25,916
Just one.

627
01:10:40,209 --> 01:10:43,958
- What do you want it for?
- An equation.

628
01:10:54,042 --> 01:10:57,958
- Sam.
- lt's Thursday, so I figured...

629
01:10:57,959 --> 01:11:03,374
No more movie nights.
I'm playing basketball today.

630
01:11:03,375 --> 01:11:05,791
Sam?

631
01:11:24,584 --> 01:11:28,208
What? Help! Help!

632
01:12:08,584 --> 01:12:11,958
Could you please get me out ofthis?

633
01:12:11,959 --> 01:12:13,666
Get me out.

634
01:12:15,292 --> 01:12:18,624
- For me?
- Hello?

635
01:12:20,125 --> 01:12:24,083
- ls that you, Sam?
- Who the hell are you?

636
01:12:24,084 --> 01:12:26,249
This is fun!

637
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:28,791
Why are you in a sack?

638
01:12:30,834 --> 01:12:34,999
Simon, you bastard!
I'm going to kill you!

639
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,749
He said l was going on a date.

640
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:41,208
Date? What date?

641
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:55,166
- Maybe we can call him?
- He doesn't have a phone.

642
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:13,166
- You're late!
- Yeah yeah, love takes time.

643
01:13:13,167 --> 01:13:17,791
- No, hurry up.
- Yeah...

644
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:27,874
- l don't think he's coming.
- Go ahead, I'll wait.

645
01:13:30,042 --> 01:13:32,791
What the hell...?

646
01:13:37,292 --> 01:13:43,999
- What was that?
- Jennifer? Flowers from Sam.

647
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,791
Thanks, they're beautiful.

648
01:13:50,417 --> 01:13:53,833
"You had me at hello. Love, Sam."

649
01:13:56,084 --> 01:14:00,541
We're all set up on the hill.
Si'l vous plaît!

650
01:14:05,584 --> 01:14:11,291
- lt's lovely...
- Come with me to the hill.

651
01:14:28,334 --> 01:14:32,208
Une petite... finger food.

652
01:14:32,209 --> 01:14:34,833
Si'l vous plaî!

653
01:14:36,334 --> 01:14:39,749
This is great.

654
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:42,541
I love kiwis.

655
01:15:02,875 --> 01:15:05,249
Cheers.

656
01:15:10,167 --> 01:15:13,624
- Okay, what do you want?
- What?

657
01:15:13,625 --> 01:15:19,083
I get it, you were
in on this from the start.

658
01:15:19,084 --> 01:15:24,166
- What do you want from us?
- l'm here for Simon's sake.

659
01:15:24,167 --> 01:15:28,666
I like him, he's great.
He said if l liked him, l'd love you.

660
01:15:28,667 --> 01:15:33,291
There are no similarities,
and no one really likes Simon.

661
01:15:33,292 --> 01:15:39,124
- How can you say that?
- Of course l like him.

662
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:43,374
- But he only cares about himself.
- That's so not true.

663
01:15:43,375 --> 01:15:48,124
He wants us to like each other
and said l'm a thousand times better.

664
01:15:48,125 --> 01:15:50,791
- 937.
- What?

665
01:15:50,792 --> 01:15:55,083
- He thinks you're 937 times better.
- Who cares?

666
01:15:55,084 --> 01:16:02,166
- l care!
- He's doing this for himself.

667
01:16:02,167 --> 01:16:05,208
Just look at what he's done.

668
01:16:05,209 --> 01:16:08,124
He's arranged for a ton offood.

669
01:16:08,125 --> 01:16:15,333
There are lights, wine, roses...
It's the ultimate romantic movie.

670
01:16:15,334 --> 01:16:18,333
Don't you realize what you mean to him?

671
01:16:22,959 --> 01:16:26,083
He even got us live music.

672
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:33,499
- Shit, how can you not see it?
- Yeah, but...

673
01:16:34,542 --> 01:16:37,749
- l don't know, I...
- What don't you know?

674
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:41,916
- l'm used to him.
- So he does this all the time?

675
01:16:41,917 --> 01:16:44,666
No, but I...

676
01:16:58,667 --> 01:17:04,624
If you could have anything you wanted,
what would you wish for?

677
01:17:12,209 --> 01:17:15,583
- A pet, maybe?
- A pet?

678
01:17:15,584 --> 01:17:21,083
Something unusual, maybe a monkey.

679
01:17:21,084 --> 01:17:27,458
So if l could have anything
I'd wish for a monkey?

680
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,499
Cheers.

681
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:45,583
Sometimes bad gives way to good.
That's a kind of balance, as well...

682
01:17:45,584 --> 01:17:51,333
Maybe you need a special kind of
intelligence to comprehend this?

683
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:53,916
Maybe you need Asperger's.

684
01:17:53,917 --> 01:17:57,999
Maybe there are feelings in space...

685
01:18:11,209 --> 01:18:14,916
That was a great surprise.

686
01:18:14,917 --> 01:18:18,458
It's not over yet. Where is Jennifer?
Are you together now?

687
01:18:18,459 --> 01:18:22,374
- No, but we may be friends.
- What?

688
01:18:22,375 --> 01:18:30,708
- But you have to get together.
- We're not getting together.

689
01:18:30,709 --> 01:18:35,583
- Calm down.
- Yes, yes, yes...

690
01:18:35,584 --> 01:18:41,208
You have to get together, Sam.
You do.

691
01:18:44,042 --> 01:18:49,499
- She's gone home...
- You scared her off! - Jennifer!

692
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:52,999
- Jennifer?!
- Calm down.

693
01:18:54,375 --> 01:18:56,374
Calm down!

694
01:19:03,834 --> 01:19:06,333
Simon!

695
01:19:06,334 --> 01:19:07,374
Simon!!

696
01:20:44,292 --> 01:20:49,166
Things change, Simon, and it's not
necessarily someone's fault.

697
01:20:49,167 --> 01:20:52,083
Everything changes.

698
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:56,083
Not me.

699
01:20:56,084 --> 01:21:01,583
You don't have to do
all those things for me.

700
01:21:01,584 --> 01:21:06,124
I had it all figured out.
You're supposed to be together now.

701
01:21:06,125 --> 01:21:09,708
Why do you want us to be together?

702
01:21:11,375 --> 01:21:17,291
- l don't want her to go away.
- That doesn't mean she'll go away.

703
01:21:17,292 --> 01:21:22,708
Sure it does. If she doesn't like you,
she won't like me.

704
01:21:22,709 --> 01:21:28,666
I'm 937 times worse than you...
And now she's gone.

705
01:21:30,584 --> 01:21:34,958
I'm not the one who's gone, you are.

706
01:21:34,959 --> 01:21:39,333
- l'm not gone, I'm right here.
- So am l.

707
01:21:39,334 --> 01:21:40,708
Hi there.

708
01:21:45,167 --> 01:21:49,208
I'm not going anywhere.

709
01:21:49,209 --> 01:21:51,333
I like you.

710
01:21:54,959 --> 01:21:59,458
Hey, come on out...

711
01:21:59,459 --> 01:22:05,833
- Why?
- Because.

712
01:22:06,875 --> 01:22:10,958
- What are you doing?
- What?

713
01:22:12,417 --> 01:22:15,833
Can l give you a hug now or what?

714
01:22:15,834 --> 01:22:20,208
- Why?
- Because l want to.

715
01:22:20,209 --> 01:22:23,958
For the lovely dinner.

716
01:22:23,959 --> 01:22:30,416
For the lovely evening, you and me
and everything. May l?

717
01:22:30,417 --> 01:22:35,999
- l don't want anyone touching me.
- Can't you tell? We already are.
