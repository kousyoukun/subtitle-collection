SIMPLE SIMON

3
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:04,166 
<i>I'm in orbit around Earth.</i>

4
00:02:04,247 --> 00:02:08,798 
<i>I'm here to gain perspective.</i>

5
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:17,879 
<i>I like space.</i>
<i>There are no problems in space.</i>

6
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:21,084 
<i>No misunderstandings. No chaos.</i>

7
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:25,399 
<i>Because in space,</i>
<i>there are no feelings.</i>

8
00:02:32,207 --> 00:02:34,675 
Simon!!!

9
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:40,202 
For the last time, get out of there.
I'm not telling you again.

10
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:46,044 
Simon, for the very last time,
get out of there!

11
00:02:46,127 --> 00:02:48,960 
Simon!!!

12
00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:58,039 
Simon, if I offer you 50 kronor,
what do you say?

13
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:06,443 
Sam, you've got to come over.
He's in the barrel.

14
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:10,236 
He's been there for eight hours now.

15
00:03:10,327 --> 00:03:12,682 
Hey...

16
00:03:14,247 --> 00:03:18,877 
- But I explained it all to him.
- Go ahead and go.

17
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:22,642 
- Go, it's fine.
- You sure?

18
00:03:22,727 --> 00:03:26,322 
Okay, I'm on my way. Yeah, bye.

19
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:32,686 
- You're too nice...
- And you're too hot.

20
00:03:36,287 --> 00:03:39,723 
What the hell?
You're in for it, mister!

21
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:42,241 
Totally retarded.

22
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:57,035 
2, 150 - that's my final offer.

23
00:04:50,927 --> 00:04:54,920 
I can't kill Mom and Dad!

24
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:35,000 
- I knew this would happen!
- What are you going to do now?

25
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,800 
You've got to be kidding...

26
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:05,364 
I was talking to my brother,
he's in the barrel.

27
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:11,761 
He's from sp... He thinks...
He's got a space ship.

28
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:23,958 
Simon, you can come out now.

29
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:28,886 
- It's okay, Simon.
- She's got to go!

30
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:33,006 
- You want to live here with us.
- No, she's got to go, Sam.

31
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:37,000 
You, me, and Frida are going
to live together. Calm down.

32
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,166 
- This will never work.
- Sure it will.

33
00:06:48,247 --> 00:06:54,243 
- I'll do everything wrong.
- No. Hey...

34
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:57,876 
He just needs to get used to it.

35
00:06:57,967 --> 00:07:02,518 
- Get used to me getting it wrong?
- No. That you're... you.

36
00:07:02,607 --> 00:07:05,997 
And you get it wrong sometimes...

37
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,446 
What are we going to do?

38
00:07:10,527 --> 00:07:12,882 
Simon?

39
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:31,484 
If you...
If we're all going to live together,

40
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:34,764 
then it's us against the world.
I need Frida.

41
00:07:34,847 --> 00:07:38,920 
She helps me, just like I help you.
So you need to help her.

42
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:42,556 
Nothing will work without her.

43
00:07:45,327 --> 00:07:47,602 
<i>It's like one of your equations.</i>

44
00:07:47,687 --> 00:07:54,525 
<i>Remove one of us and there will</i>
<i>be an imbalance. Understand?</i>

45
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,962 
<i>Einstein?</i>

46
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:10,360 
<i>Some people think</i>
<i>I'm an idiot, but I'm not.</i>

47
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:14,360 
<i>I just want things</i>
<i>to remain the same.</i>

48
00:08:14,447 --> 00:08:18,520 
<i>I don't like change,</i>
<i>but I do like Sam.</i>

49
00:08:18,607 --> 00:08:22,077 
<i>So I've got to make</i>
<i>this equation come out right.</i>

50
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:27,161 
<i>Sam needs Frida like I need Sam.</i>

51
00:08:27,247 --> 00:08:31,445 
Good, let's go shoot some hoops.

52
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:34,997 
Last one down is a square.

53
00:09:01,847 --> 00:09:07,479 
To help this equation come out right,
I've scheduled our activities.

54
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:13,199 
It's designed to make
our lives as simple as possible.

55
00:09:19,807 --> 00:09:20,956 
Fucking jerk!!

56
00:09:22,207 --> 00:09:25,005 
Without the right time,
weight and angle,

57
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:29,046 
we may be thrown off balance.

58
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:32,158 
<i>Don't touch me</i>
<i>I'm Asperger's</i>

59
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:46,043 
I prefer circles to humans.
Circles are continuous,

60
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:49,085 
while humans are complex
and hard to understand.

61
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:51,920 
HAPPY - SAD - ANGRY

62
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:54,726 
TIRED - SURPRISED - NEUTRAL

63
00:09:55,287 --> 00:09:58,120 
Ready for breakfast?

64
00:10:38,327 --> 00:10:39,646 
See you later...

65
00:10:39,727 --> 00:10:41,558 
<i>Sam helps me arrive on time.</i>

66
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:44,639 
<i>Time affects harmony.</i>

67
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:49,482 
<i>If you're not on time,</i>
<i>you risk chaos.</i>

68
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:54,202 
I'm sorry, are you all right?

69
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,999 
- What do you think you're doing?
- Slapping your face.

70
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:03,922 
- Yeah... But what for?
- I have Asperger's.

71
00:11:04,007 --> 00:11:08,285 
- And that makes it okay to hit people?
- You grabbed my arm.

72
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:11,564 
I don't like being touched.

73
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:18,356 
- Let me...
- I'm late.

74
00:11:22,487 --> 00:11:25,877 
On time, as usual.

75
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:35,797 
<i>I work seven hours a day, five days</i>
<i>a week, thirteen lunar cycles a year.</i>

76
00:11:35,887 --> 00:11:39,038 
<i>To some people, 13 means bad luck,</i>
<i>but not to me.</i>

77
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:44,884 
<i>It's a prime number,</i>
<i>only divisible by itself. Like me.</i>

78
00:11:47,447 --> 00:11:53,682 
Attention!
As a team, we have to stick together.

79
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:59,285 
Otherwise the whole thingamabob
will just be a big ole mess.

80
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:03,679 
<i>I don't have friends.</i>
<i>Feelings just create problems.</i>

81
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:11,037 
<i>Take Peter, for instance: Peter likes</i>
<i>Jonna and tries hard to impress her.</i>

82
00:12:13,647 --> 00:12:17,925 
- ...fall behind...
<i>- Jonna doesn't like Peter, though.</i>

83
00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:25,482 
<i>Girls only like guys who don't</i>
<i>like them.</i>

84
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:29,719 
<i>So Jonna's in love with Björn.</i>
<i>"Retard laugh" Björn.</i>

85
00:12:29,807 --> 00:12:33,482 
<i>But all he likes is to laugh...</i>

86
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:41,925 
<i>This is a classic "love triangle"</i>
<i>and it leads to chaos.</i>

87
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:44,237 
<i>I don't like triangles.</i>

88
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:46,841 
We're like brothers.

89
00:12:46,927 --> 00:12:49,964 
Like brothers and sis...
We're like siblings.

90
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:56,441 
Siblings who love each other
and love to work together.

91
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:59,121 
And so we just do it.

92
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:02,681 
You bastard!

93
00:13:04,487 --> 00:13:06,762 
Thank you and goodbye.

94
00:13:17,887 --> 00:13:19,559 
I'm home!

95
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:26,881 
How long do I have?

96
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:31,518 
Ten minutes and five seconds, four
seconds, three seconds, two seconds...

97
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:34,565 
- ...one second. Ten minutes.
- Perfect.

98
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,036 
<i>I have different foods</i>
<i>for different days.</i>

99
00:13:37,127 --> 00:13:39,960 
<i>Monday: Sausage and pasta.</i>
<i>Tuesday: Pancakes.</i>

100
00:13:40,047 --> 00:13:43,039 
<i>Wednesday: Melts.</i>
<i>Thursday: Potato pancakes.</i>

101
00:13:43,127 --> 00:13:47,882 
<i>Friday: Tacos. Saturday: Pizza.</i>
<i>Sunday: Sam's zucchini special.</i>

102
00:13:57,847 --> 00:14:01,635 
<i>Sam cooks, I set and clear the table,</i>
<i>and Frida does the dishes.</i>

103
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:06,164 
<i>It's a great setup that gives me</i>
<i>time to practice after dinner.</i>

104
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:18,718 
Hi...

105
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:22,436 
Listen, I think I have an STD.

106
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:29,157 
- I'm not in the mood...
- Only it's on my face.

107
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:34,242 
You're so not funny!

108
00:14:34,327 --> 00:14:36,887 
Nice.

109
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:40,516 
Hey, why don't we
play some basketball?

110
00:14:40,607 --> 00:14:44,236 
- Before he comes back.
- I have to do the dishes.

111
00:14:44,327 --> 00:14:48,286 
I'll do it later. I promise. Come on...

112
00:14:49,127 --> 00:14:53,837 
We'll have ten minutes before he
returns. Maybe you can catch my STD.

113
00:14:58,447 --> 00:15:00,358 
Come on.

114
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:19,924 
Foul, foul! - Sam, foul.

115
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:23,766 
You just want to shoot penalties.

116
00:15:23,847 --> 00:15:26,759 
<i>There's no touching in basketball.</i>

117
00:15:26,847 --> 00:15:30,999 
<i>You put the ball through the hoop.</i>
<i>It's easy,</i>

118
00:15:31,087 --> 00:15:35,399 
<i>since the hoop's circumference</i>
<i>is 96.5% larger than the ball's.</i>

119
00:15:35,487 --> 00:15:39,400 
<i>All you have to do is calculate</i>
<i>the velocity, mass and angle.</i>

120
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:43,446 
- Do-over!
- One more time.

121
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:46,280 
I'll go do the dishes.

122
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:54,685 
- Another do-over, Sam.
- One more time.

123
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:58,883 
Movie night!

124
00:16:01,207 --> 00:16:05,644 
This one again?!
It's four hours long.

125
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:09,322 
Two hours, 22 minutes,
and 3 7 seconds.

126
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,998 
- Can't we watch something on TV?
- No.

127
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:19,877 
- There's a Hugh Grant romcom on.
- Yes...

128
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,879 
No. I n that case
you'll have to watch in your room.

129
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:25,925 
Sure... - Come on.

130
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:37,955 
- I'd rather watch the space movie.
- I know.

131
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:11,522 
What the hell...?

132
00:17:13,247 --> 00:17:16,922 
We're out of toilet paper...

133
00:17:17,007 --> 00:17:19,885 
Get out of here!

134
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:26,515 
- Christ! You're not listening.
- We'll get through this.

135
00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:31,237 
No, you're just kidding yourself.
This isn't going to work.

136
00:17:31,327 --> 00:17:35,718 
- What do you want me to do?
- I can't take this crap.

137
00:17:35,807 --> 00:17:40,085 
I can't kick my own brother out!

138
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:46,959 
Isn't that convenient?

139
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:50,676 
Frida... Where are you going?

140
00:17:51,607 --> 00:17:55,122 
Why can't you just shut up?!

141
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:59,200 
Stop playing, you fucking psycho!

142
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,404 
Don't touch him!

143
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:14,285 
- Don't go! Please?
- Fuck off!

144
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:17,359 
- Leave me alone.
- I want to be with you.

145
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:23,920 
- No, you want to be with your brother.
- He needs me, just like I need you.

146
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:28,957 
Please don't go.

147
00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:42,363 
She left, but at least now
it'll be nice and quiet.

148
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:48,677 
Simon?

149
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:14,366 
It's not your fault.
She didn't mean what she said.

150
00:19:14,447 --> 00:19:17,405 
She'll come back, she always does.

151
00:19:17,487 --> 00:19:22,641 
Don't be sad. Okay?

152
00:19:29,527 --> 00:19:32,724 
<i>It's important</i>
<i>to maintain the correct orbit.</i>

153
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:36,117 
<i>If you go too fast,</i>

154
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:40,837 
<i>Too slow, and you spiral</i>
<i>downwards... and crash.</i>

155
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:46,763 
<i>If you cannot maintain orbit,</i>
<i>you end up with chaos.</i>

156
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:50,317 
<i>So I have to maintain orbit.</i>

157
00:19:59,927 --> 00:20:01,155 
Shit...

158
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:06,156 
Wake up, we're late.

159
00:20:12,287 --> 00:20:16,326 
Sam, it's my turn to shower!

160
00:20:16,407 --> 00:20:22,084 
I'm three minutes and seventeen
seconds late. 18, 19, 20, 21...

161
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:25,398 
...22, 23, 24.

162
00:20:38,207 --> 00:20:41,404 
Where is Frida?
You said that she'd be back.

163
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:44,479 
- Then I guess she will.
- Do you promise, Sam?

164
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:48,242 
Absolutely. Now hurry up, we're late.

165
00:20:52,847 --> 00:20:56,806 
- I'll be late.
- Get off, it won't start.

166
00:21:04,447 --> 00:21:06,836 
- Are you angry?
- No!

167
00:21:14,127 --> 00:21:18,723 
<i>People can't be trusted. They say</i>
<i>one thing and mean another.</i>

168
00:21:18,807 --> 00:21:22,197 
This won't hurt a bit.

169
00:21:22,287 --> 00:21:25,404 
I'm Sweden's best dart player.

170
00:21:27,007 --> 00:21:28,599 
- Are you angry?
- No!

171
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:32,884 
<i>I can get angry too,</i>
<i>when I can't keep to schedule.</i>

172
00:21:32,967 --> 00:21:36,846 
<i>Because I don't like change.</i>

173
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:50,119 
What's going on, Simon?

174
00:21:50,207 --> 00:21:53,916 
- Is the world coming to an end?
- Yes.

175
00:21:54,007 --> 00:21:59,081 
I n about five billions years, the earth
will be swallowed up by the sun.

176
00:22:01,327 --> 00:22:07,562 
"One time is no time",
as the saying goes.

177
00:22:07,647 --> 00:22:12,198 
No, one time is one time.

178
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:17,202 
Well, you'll have to start
with No. 42 in the meantime.

179
00:22:17,287 --> 00:22:19,562 
Go on, time is money.

180
00:22:19,647 --> 00:22:23,686 
<i>Time isn't money.</i>
<i>Time is time. Money is money.</i>

181
00:22:26,687 --> 00:22:31,636 
<i>I don't like people saying</i>
<i>things are what they're not.</i>

182
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:35,561 
<i>Sam is the only person I trust.</i>
<i>He means what he says.</i>

183
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:40,163 
<i>If he says Frida will come back,</i>
<i>she will.</i>

184
00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:47,561 
Hello?

185
00:22:47,647 --> 00:22:49,638 
Hi!

186
00:22:49,727 --> 00:22:53,083 
Hi, how are you?

187
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:56,198 
Yeah...

188
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:58,801 
You're moving out?

189
00:23:31,647 --> 00:23:33,524 
I'm home.

190
00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:36,523 
Sam?

191
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:41,282 
Sam?

192
00:23:57,687 --> 00:24:02,158 
- Dinner was 20 minutes ago, Sam.
- I haven't had time to make any.

193
00:24:02,247 --> 00:24:07,924 
- Tacos, today is tacos.
- Know what? Let's have pizza.

194
00:24:08,007 --> 00:24:11,966 
- No, it's not pizza day.
- It'll be fine.

195
00:24:12,047 --> 00:24:14,720 
- Where is Frida?
- She's not coming back.

196
00:24:14,807 --> 00:24:18,561 
- She always comes back.
- No. She's moved out.

197
00:24:18,647 --> 00:24:23,277 
- You said that she would.
- I guess I was wrong.

198
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:28,361 
- I'd like to order two pizzas...
- Sam... Sam!

199
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:31,484 
Who's doing the dishes?

200
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:33,478 
I set the table, you cook,
she does the dishes.

201
00:24:33,567 --> 00:24:36,639 
She's gone, you blockhead!

202
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:42,518 
- No, I didn't mean you.
- Who's going to do the dishes, Sam?

203
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:46,202 
We're having pizza. No one
needs to do any damn dishes!

204
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:49,484 
I don't want pizza!

205
00:24:59,687 --> 00:25:02,804 
She's not coming back.

206
00:25:02,887 --> 00:25:05,560 
Sure she is,
she has to do the dishes!

207
00:25:05,647 --> 00:25:11,324 
She's not going to do the dishes
anymore. She won't rent movies,

208
00:25:11,407 --> 00:25:15,002 
play basketball, or do this or that...

209
00:25:16,287 --> 00:25:19,916 
She won't be doing
anything anymore. Get it?

210
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:32,363 
Besides, she isn't right for us anyway.

211
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:36,918 
She's too pedantic. She eats those
disgusting fish paste sandwiches.

212
00:25:37,007 --> 00:25:39,726 
She doesn't make any noise
when we have sex.

213
00:25:39,807 --> 00:25:45,757 
She's selfish and she doesn't get me.
But she wears that butt-ugly hat.

214
00:25:45,847 --> 00:25:51,001 
That ugly, fucking Frida hat!

215
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:57,037 
Simon?

216
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:19,518 
- Hi, it's me, Simon.
- What are you doing here?

217
00:26:19,607 --> 00:26:22,883 
- I don't want pizza on a Friday.
- Sorry, I can't help you.

218
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:27,802 
- You have to come back.
- No, I don't. Goodbye, Simon.

219
00:26:38,207 --> 00:26:43,725 
Hi, it's me. All you have to do is
change and everything will be fine.

220
00:26:43,807 --> 00:26:47,516 
You're pedantic, you don't
make noise when you have sex...

221
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:50,246 
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm Simon.

222
00:26:50,327 --> 00:26:56,084 
It's your fault it's not fine!
You have to change.

223
00:27:05,807 --> 00:27:08,275 
- Hi...
- I'll call the police!

224
00:27:08,367 --> 00:27:12,963 
- I can't change, but you can.
- I don't want to!

225
00:27:13,047 --> 00:27:16,835 
Find some other damn girl
who can stand living with you!

226
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:21,884 
Some other damn girl?

227
00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:27,166 
You may be a wiz at physics,
but you suck at playing the drums.

228
00:27:27,247 --> 00:27:31,638 
- Just so you know.
- I do know.

229
00:27:31,727 --> 00:27:34,719 
That's why I need to practice!

230
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:42,002 
I'm home.

231
00:27:42,087 --> 00:27:45,875 
- Where have you been?
- We have to find some other damn girl.

232
00:27:45,967 --> 00:27:48,117 
What are you talking about?

233
00:27:48,207 --> 00:27:52,758 
<i>If Frida won't come back, I'll have</i>
<i>to find some other damn girl.</i>

234
00:27:52,847 --> 00:27:57,602 
<i>A girl who doesn't fight,</i>
<i>a girl who is just like Sam.</i>

235
00:27:57,687 --> 00:28:03,637 
<i>No one knows Sam better than me,</i>
<i>and I can look at it scientifically.</i>

236
00:28:03,727 --> 00:28:05,877 
Sam: Cooks - Girl: Does dishes

237
00:28:08,047 --> 00:28:10,038 
Hi...

238
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:13,637 
Hello...

239
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:19,364 
- Hey...
- You're three minutes late.

240
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:22,723 
- Do I look like a bus driver to you?
- Yes.

241
00:28:22,807 --> 00:28:25,844 
You drive a bus
and wear a bus driver's uniform.

242
00:28:25,927 --> 00:28:32,162 
It may look like that,
but that's not really what I am.

243
00:28:32,247 --> 00:28:36,957 
Eight years of cooking school.
Chef at the city's best restaurant.

244
00:28:37,047 --> 00:28:43,441 
For what? People want fast food.
Instant this or that...

245
00:28:43,527 --> 00:28:49,284 
Everything in an instant.
You can't hurry an excellent sauce.

246
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:53,042 
It's like my old saucier,
Gaston, used to say...

247
00:28:57,767 --> 00:29:01,476 
Or something. I don't speak French.

248
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:05,003 
A great sauce takes time, just like love.

249
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,760 
Hi, Mom. - Hi, Dad.

250
00:29:38,607 --> 00:29:41,679 
- Bye, Mom. - Bye, Dad.
- Simon?

251
00:29:41,767 --> 00:29:46,795 
- What are you doing with that camera?
- Finding Sam a new girlfriend.

252
00:29:46,887 --> 00:29:50,721 
- What's wrong with Frida?
- They broke up.

253
00:29:50,807 --> 00:29:54,641 
- Why did they break up?
- She won't change.

254
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:59,755 
So I have to find some other damn girl
who can stand living with me.

255
00:30:03,127 --> 00:30:05,846 
What a shame.

256
00:30:07,287 --> 00:30:12,600 
Finish with a pinch of nutmeg.
Dip the tip of a knife in, that's all.

257
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:15,201 
<i>Une petite la</i> knife... whatever.

258
00:30:15,287 --> 00:30:21,476 
Bitterness has its place in every
sauce, just like in life itself.

259
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:28,002 
- You can't do anything about it.
- <i>I'm home.</i>

260
00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:33,719 
It'll never work, Mom.
Moving back home would kill him.

261
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:41,043 
I've got to go,
I'm doing the laundry.

262
00:30:41,127 --> 00:30:44,722 
Right, busy bees. Bye.

263
00:30:45,687 --> 00:30:49,123 
We do our laundry
6:30 - 9 pm on Fridays.

264
00:30:49,207 --> 00:30:52,995 
- Yeah, I lied.
- Oh.

265
00:30:54,087 --> 00:31:00,720 
- Who the hell watches "Lassie"?
- You're watching "Lassie".

266
00:31:00,807 --> 00:31:03,765 
Don't you like dogs?

267
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:08,159 
- Don't you like dogs?
- No.

268
00:31:11,207 --> 00:31:17,396 
<i>Facts about Sam: Sam is 23</i>
<i>and does not generate chaos.</i>

269
00:31:17,487 --> 00:31:20,524 
<i>Sam likes Simon, cooking,</i>
<i>and black licorice.</i>

270
00:31:20,607 --> 00:31:23,280 
<i>Sam dislikes dogs, mustard and math.</i>

271
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:25,437 
- What deduction?
- Done!

272
00:31:25,527 --> 00:31:30,647 
<i>To find a new girl for Sam, I need</i>
<i>13 questions that reveal who Sam is.</i>

273
00:31:30,727 --> 00:31:35,243 
<i>Then I have to find a new girl</i>
<i>who fits in with his responses.</i>

274
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:39,597 
<i>I'm going to find</i>
<i>the perfect girl for Sam.</i>

275
00:31:45,047 --> 00:31:50,963 
- Sorry. Oh, It's you again.
- I always pass this spot at 8:55 am.

276
00:31:51,047 --> 00:31:54,323 
- Gee, I thought it was destiny.
- There is no such thing.

277
00:31:54,407 --> 00:32:00,755 
- It's only make-believe.
- It's good to blame stuff on.

278
00:32:00,847 --> 00:32:05,079 
It's all mathematics and determinism.
Can I ask you some questions?

279
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:09,160 
- Sure, what?
- Romantic comedies or sci-fi?

280
00:32:09,247 --> 00:32:12,045 
I don't watch that many movies.

281
00:32:12,127 --> 00:32:16,803 
- Dogs or cats?
- Dogs... and cats.

282
00:32:16,887 --> 00:32:19,845 
- Do you make noise during sex?
- What?!

283
00:32:19,927 --> 00:32:23,317 
- Do you make noise during sex?
- Do you?

284
00:32:23,407 --> 00:32:25,796 
No, I don't have sex!

285
00:32:25,887 --> 00:32:29,516 
Oh, sorry. - Hello? Hi...

286
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:35,320 
Out and about...

287
00:32:41,487 --> 00:32:44,320 
I see... Oh well.

288
00:32:44,407 --> 00:32:49,276 
No, it's cool.

289
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:53,121 
Okay, great. Bye.

290
00:32:56,247 --> 00:33:01,002 
Are you sad? Your mouth went from
a happy mouth to a sad mouth.

291
00:33:01,087 --> 00:33:06,559 
- Have any more questions?
- No, you gave me the wrong answers.

292
00:33:06,647 --> 00:33:11,516 
I didn't know there were
any wrong answers there.

293
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:19,164 
- Do you make noise during sex?
- Sometimes.

294
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,078 
- Yes.
- I don't know.

295
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:24,079 
Can you do dishes, yes or no?

296
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:26,681 
- Train or bus?
- Train.

297
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:28,519 
Ketchup or mustard?

298
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:31,804 
- Ketchup or mustard?
- Which do you want?

299
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:35,482 
- Ketchup or mustard?
- Which do you want?

300
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:40,925 
Jeez, take both!
We're waiting in line here!

301
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:54,200 
- Do you like Simon?
- Who's Simon?

302
00:33:54,287 --> 00:33:56,482 
- Yes.
- Don't know...

303
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,285 
- Sports: yes or no?
- No.

304
00:33:58,367 --> 00:34:01,200 
Licorice or fruit-flavored candy?
Dogs or cats?

305
00:34:01,287 --> 00:34:04,404 
- It's not a dog, it's a Great Dane.
- Wrong.

306
00:34:04,487 --> 00:34:08,765 
<i>Finding the perfect girl</i>
<i>isn't as easy as you might think.</i>

307
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:10,803 
<i>They always get one wrong.</i>

308
00:34:10,887 --> 00:34:14,197 
- Licorice or fruit-flavored candy?
- Fruit.

309
00:34:14,287 --> 00:34:17,996 
I hate the way licorice
gets stuck in my teeth.

310
00:34:18,087 --> 00:34:20,601 
<i>Equations need careful consideration.</i>

311
00:34:20,687 --> 00:34:23,918 
<i>And love, like a good sauce,</i>
<i>takes time.</i>

312
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:39,766 
Hi, Simon.
I brought you some breakfast.

313
00:34:48,607 --> 00:34:53,840 
Can't you come and live with us?
So that Sam gets some peace.

314
00:34:53,927 --> 00:35:00,446 
- Just until everything's worked out.
- I'm going to work things out for Sam.

315
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:18,804 
Simon? Don't you want me
to help you with breakfast?

316
00:35:18,887 --> 00:35:22,846 
And we could talk about this.

317
00:35:22,927 --> 00:35:27,045 
Hello? Are you there?

318
00:35:41,687 --> 00:35:45,646 
- Can you do dishes? Yes or no.
- No.

319
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:51,802 
Can you see yourself dating someone
who is scientifically perfect for you?

320
00:35:51,887 --> 00:35:55,482 
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

321
00:36:07,647 --> 00:36:10,036 
Romantic comedies or sci-fi?

322
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:15,918 
If it doesn't contain violence
or blood, I'm not interested.

323
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:22,560 
When bodily fluids flow
or limbs are torn off, I feel...

324
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:26,117 
- Romantic comedies or sci-fi?
- Sci-fi. But I prefer action.

325
00:36:26,207 --> 00:36:29,643 
- Dogs or cats?
- I don't like dogs. Cats!

326
00:36:29,727 --> 00:36:32,116 
Don't yell.

327
00:36:32,207 --> 00:36:35,085 
- Do you like Simon?
- No.

328
00:36:35,167 --> 00:36:37,965 
I think you're an idiot.

329
00:36:41,207 --> 00:36:44,961 
- Could I ask you 13 questions?
- Okay...

330
00:36:45,047 --> 00:36:48,483 
- Can you do dishes? Yes or no.
- Yes.

331
00:36:48,567 --> 00:36:53,516 
Good. Would you date someone
who is scientifically perfect for you?

332
00:36:53,607 --> 00:36:56,519 
Absolutely. Yes.

333
00:36:58,567 --> 00:37:01,877 
Great, let me just take your picture.

334
00:37:01,967 --> 00:37:05,084 
Look as attractive as possible.

335
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:08,637 
No, attractive!

336
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:11,116 
More attractive!

337
00:37:13,007 --> 00:37:17,205 
Perfect. You can go now, if you want.

338
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:20,438 
Bye.

339
00:37:56,607 --> 00:38:00,646 
- What's this?
- Possible girlfriends.

340
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:13,078 
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Find a girlfriend.

341
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:20,084 
- Number 13 is perfect for you.
- That's not how it works.

342
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:23,159 
The ones at the back
got the most right.

343
00:38:23,247 --> 00:38:27,604 
Number 13 is exactly like you:
"Sci-fi or Romcom?" Sci-Fi.

344
00:38:27,687 --> 00:38:32,556 
- "Cats or dogs?" Cats...
- There are no right answers.

345
00:38:32,647 --> 00:38:36,196 
It's about feelings.

346
00:38:36,287 --> 00:38:40,519 
I'm more likely to fall in love with
someone who's the complete opposite.

347
00:38:40,607 --> 00:38:47,718 
It would suck to be with someone who
is exactly like me. Don't you think?

348
00:38:49,487 --> 00:38:51,637 
No...

349
00:38:52,807 --> 00:38:55,275 
I don't understand.

350
00:39:00,127 --> 00:39:02,083 
Come on.

351
00:39:04,087 --> 00:39:06,203 
Come on.

352
00:39:11,567 --> 00:39:14,764 
Look...

353
00:39:14,847 --> 00:39:20,717 
Just like the same poles
of a magnet repel each other,

354
00:39:20,807 --> 00:39:26,040 
people who are too similar
can also repel each other.

355
00:39:26,127 --> 00:39:31,485 
And just like the opposite poles
of a magnet attract each other...

356
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:35,446 
... people who are different
can be drawn to each other.

357
00:39:35,527 --> 00:39:41,602 
Like us. We're different,
but we like each other.

358
00:39:41,687 --> 00:39:47,205 
Stop it with the equations.
Whatever happens, happens...

359
00:40:44,407 --> 00:40:48,366 
What the hell are you doing?
Watch out.

360
00:40:54,367 --> 00:41:00,044 
- Oh, look who's here...
- Yes, and it's all your fault.

361
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:03,039 
- Why?
- I was supposed to run into you.

362
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,925 
So we could talk.
But you weren't on time.

363
00:41:06,007 --> 00:41:09,795 
We don't have to run into each other
to talk, do we?

364
00:41:09,887 --> 00:41:15,359 
You have to meet my brother.
Do you want to?

365
00:41:15,447 --> 00:41:19,645 
- You're each other's opposites.
- We are?

366
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:24,357 
He's not like me,
he doesn't have Asperger's.

367
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:28,076 
He's 93 7 times better than I am.
Want to meet him?

368
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:32,558 
- I don't know if I want to.
- What?

369
00:41:32,647 --> 00:41:38,438 
It feels kind of weird,
I don't even know you.

370
00:41:38,527 --> 00:41:44,875 
If you two fall in love you'll get to
know me. You'll see me all the time.

371
00:41:46,127 --> 00:41:50,518 
Yeah. But the thing is...

372
00:41:50,607 --> 00:41:54,759 
We've only run into each other
a few times.

373
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:57,998 
- I don't even know your name.
- I'm Simon.

374
00:41:58,087 --> 00:42:01,079 
- Now you know my name.
- Hello, Simon.

375
00:42:01,167 --> 00:42:05,319 
- I'm Jennifer.
- I don't like touching people.

376
00:42:05,407 --> 00:42:07,875 
I forgot, sorry.

377
00:42:07,967 --> 00:42:12,165 
Hi there... I completely forgot.

378
00:42:18,927 --> 00:42:21,646 
What are you looking at?

379
00:42:21,727 --> 00:42:26,960 
- You look really tired.
- I know, I was out all night.

380
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:30,244 
Was there anything else? I have to go.

381
00:42:30,327 --> 00:42:35,242 
- So do you want to meet my brother?
- This is going too fast...

382
00:42:35,327 --> 00:42:39,161 
- Do you want to?
- I can't decide just like that.

383
00:42:39,247 --> 00:42:43,445 
- I need to know now.
- I'm still drunk, don't pressure me.

384
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:48,237 
- I have to think about it.
- But I need to know now.

385
00:43:02,087 --> 00:43:04,726 
I feel that our discipline
isn't up to par.

386
00:43:04,807 --> 00:43:09,722 
People are tardy, there's a lot
of hullabaloo and high jinks.

387
00:43:09,807 --> 00:43:13,766 
I don't want any more
rule breaking and... who are you?

388
00:43:17,527 --> 00:43:21,520 
Hello. Well, I'm here to have a look.

389
00:43:22,447 --> 00:43:27,760 
- Oh, you're Simon's guardian?
- That's right.

390
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:38,476 
The rest of us will
continue with our regular duties...

391
00:43:38,567 --> 00:43:42,606 
Just like any other day.

392
00:44:09,207 --> 00:44:13,803 
You do this every day?
Don't you get bored?

393
00:44:13,887 --> 00:44:17,926 
Not every day. Monday through Friday,
9 am to 5 pm, lunch 12 to 1.

394
00:44:18,007 --> 00:44:21,522 
Right, isn't it lunch time soon?
I'm starving.

395
00:44:21,607 --> 00:44:26,237 
Lunch time is in 22 minutes
and 13 seconds. 12, 11...

396
00:44:26,327 --> 00:44:30,161 
- ... 10, 9...
- Give me that watch.

397
00:44:30,247 --> 00:44:33,478 
- Hand it over!
- Why?

398
00:44:33,567 --> 00:44:35,956 
Give it to me!

399
00:44:40,207 --> 00:44:41,322 
Thanks.

400
00:44:41,407 --> 00:44:46,162 
- What are you doing?
- Time sure flies, it's lunch time.

401
00:44:46,247 --> 00:44:49,398 
That's impossible, you're lying.

402
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:53,196 
Come on, Simon, let's get some lunch.

403
00:44:55,047 --> 00:44:59,279 
VA squared equals G0,
times R0 squared divided by RA

404
00:44:59,367 --> 00:45:02,200 
times 2RP divided by RA plus RP

405
00:45:02,287 --> 00:45:06,280 
where G0 is equal to the surface
gravitational acceleration...

406
00:45:06,367 --> 00:45:09,439 
- What's that about?
- Space and time.

407
00:45:09,527 --> 00:45:14,999 
Don't be so hung up on time or
nothing unexpected will ever happen.

408
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,885 
I don't like unexpected things.

409
00:45:19,407 --> 00:45:22,444 
You're going to like this.

410
00:45:25,127 --> 00:45:30,485 
- Is it drums? Space sounds?
- No, just listen.

411
00:45:30,567 --> 00:45:34,924 
- Is it emotional? I don't like that.
- Just take the earpiece.

412
00:45:42,287 --> 00:45:47,998 
I always sync everything I see
so that it's in time to the music.

413
00:45:48,087 --> 00:45:52,365 
- Like a music video in my head.
- I don't understand.

414
00:45:52,447 --> 00:45:56,645 
You know that feeling
that the world revolves around you.

415
00:45:56,727 --> 00:46:02,040 
It's almost as if the world
adapts itself to your music.

416
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:05,756 
- Simple.
- I don't know that feeling.

417
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:09,044 
- Listen to this.
- I can't hear anything.

418
00:46:09,127 --> 00:46:13,006 
- I can hear it now.
- Okay.

419
00:46:51,567 --> 00:46:54,206 
Isn't that adorable?

420
00:46:55,167 --> 00:46:58,842 
- What are you doing?
- You touched me!

421
00:46:58,927 --> 00:47:02,636 
Sorry, I forgot.

422
00:47:02,727 --> 00:47:07,084 
- I have to go back to work now.
- No you don't.

423
00:47:07,167 --> 00:47:11,604 
I have the watch,
and I say it's still lunch time.

424
00:47:11,687 --> 00:47:18,286 
- All right, but don't touch me!
- Okay, I promise I won't.

425
00:47:19,887 --> 00:47:22,117 
Simon?

426
00:47:24,527 --> 00:47:27,803 
- Don't touch me!
- Sorry, I forgot.

427
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:30,037 
Come on...

428
00:47:32,807 --> 00:47:36,880 
- Don't touch me!
- Watch it!

429
00:47:45,767 --> 00:47:48,759 
Don't touch me!

430
00:47:50,207 --> 00:47:54,120 
Simon?! What are you doing?

431
00:47:55,527 --> 00:48:00,601 
- You always wear the same clothes.
- This shirt is comfortable.

432
00:48:00,687 --> 00:48:06,045 
- And it's red and blue.
- I think I like all colors.

433
00:48:06,127 --> 00:48:09,199 
- I don't like brown.
- No, a manhole!

434
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:12,757 
- You touched me again.
- Manhole covers bring bad luck!

435
00:48:12,847 --> 00:48:16,283 
- It's round, I like round.
- But it's brown.

436
00:48:16,367 --> 00:48:19,837 
Do you like round things
even if they're brown?

437
00:48:19,927 --> 00:48:23,761 
Wrap your head around that!

438
00:48:26,567 --> 00:48:31,197 
I like that it's round,
but not that it's brown.

439
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:35,159 
Please come in, this is my place.

440
00:48:35,247 --> 00:48:38,319 
Make yourself at home.

441
00:48:41,047 --> 00:48:43,242 
Beep-beep...

442
00:48:45,007 --> 00:48:49,205 
- Why is it so messy?
- It's not, I just have a lot of stuff.

443
00:48:49,287 --> 00:48:55,237 
- Why are your records so old?
- You should talk, Mr. Polaroid.

444
00:48:55,327 --> 00:48:59,445 
Scoot... My fish. And the flowers.

445
00:49:01,287 --> 00:49:07,123 
- Why do you have two television sets?
- If that one breaks, I've got this.

446
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:12,122 
- Why do you have bagpipes?
- Why do you ask so many questions?

447
00:49:12,207 --> 00:49:15,358 
So that I can get to know you.

448
00:49:15,447 --> 00:49:17,677 
To see if your brother
and I are compatible?

449
00:49:17,767 --> 00:49:21,282 
No, to make sure you aren't,
so you can be together.

450
00:49:21,367 --> 00:49:25,804 
Like magnets. Opposites attract.

451
00:49:25,887 --> 00:49:29,846 
I've never met anyone like you.

452
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:41,122 
- A good sauce is what's important.
- What goes in the sauce?

453
00:49:41,207 --> 00:49:44,483 
Go for a red wine sauce,
that always works.

454
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:48,560 
Sam. What do you mean, "missing"?

455
00:49:48,647 --> 00:49:54,119 
Well, he's been late all week.
And today, third day in a row...

456
00:49:54,207 --> 00:49:59,406 
He brought some girl along
and now he's just up and disappeared.

457
00:49:59,487 --> 00:50:02,763 
- What girl?
- His guardian.

458
00:50:02,847 --> 00:50:07,637 
- I'm his guardian.
- How am I supposed to remember that?

459
00:50:07,727 --> 00:50:11,197 
I thought it was
one of your girlfriends.

460
00:50:11,287 --> 00:50:15,963 
- I had the same girl for five years.
<i>- Is this about your girlfriend?</i>

461
00:50:16,047 --> 00:50:20,757 
- I don't have one, we broke up.
- What a shame.

462
00:50:20,847 --> 00:50:25,841 
- <i>Where is Simon?</i>
- That's the thing.

463
00:50:25,927 --> 00:50:29,966 
- I don't know. He's gone.
- Idiot ...

464
00:50:30,047 --> 00:50:32,845 
Idiot ...

465
00:50:32,927 --> 00:50:35,316 
Right...

466
00:50:44,247 --> 00:50:47,762 
Hello... Excuse me?

467
00:50:47,847 --> 00:50:50,680 
- Hi, have you seen Simon?
- No.

468
00:50:50,767 --> 00:50:54,282 
Was he here this morn... Hey?

469
00:50:55,607 --> 00:51:00,522 
Could you turn that thing off?!
Stop blowing!

470
00:51:00,607 --> 00:51:03,246 
Get it out of here!

471
00:51:04,447 --> 00:51:07,837 
Was he... Hello?

472
00:51:07,927 --> 00:51:11,044 
You have to stop!

473
00:51:13,287 --> 00:51:16,199 
- Get off!
- Lie still.

474
00:51:16,287 --> 00:51:17,800 
Get off!

475
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:21,357 
He's cross-eyed,
never smiles, wears red and blue...

476
00:51:21,447 --> 00:51:25,838 
- ...walks all stiff. Name's Simon.
- I'll find him.

477
00:51:25,927 --> 00:51:33,003 
- Should I file a report?
- Nah, I'll remember...

478
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:46,642 
- Sorry I left you alone. Is it okay?
- Yes, I like being alone.

479
00:51:46,727 --> 00:51:51,960 
Do you? Me too.
But only when I choose to be alone.

480
00:51:52,047 --> 00:51:54,959 
I generally choose
to be with someone, though.

481
00:51:55,047 --> 00:52:00,280 
- I don't need to be alone, I have Sam.
- Right.

482
00:52:03,167 --> 00:52:07,160 
- Nice, huh? Just like you.
- No, not just like me.

483
00:52:08,527 --> 00:52:10,836 
Your colors.

484
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:14,078 
Yes, red and blue.

485
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:17,842 
And here are some melts.

486
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:21,681 
- You have to make them round.
- You've said so a thousand times.

487
00:52:21,767 --> 00:52:25,442 
No, five times. Who is it?

488
00:52:25,527 --> 00:52:28,360 
Right, it's "mini-Saturday".

489
00:52:28,447 --> 00:52:31,757 
No, it's Wednesday.
Today is Wednesday, Jennifer!

490
00:52:31,847 --> 00:52:35,999 
- Hi!
- Hi, honey.

491
00:52:36,087 --> 00:52:38,555 
How are you?

492
00:52:38,647 --> 00:52:42,242 
So here you are.

493
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:44,443 
I'd kind of forgotten...

494
00:52:44,527 --> 00:52:49,601 
This is Simon. He can't touch anyone!

495
00:52:49,687 --> 00:52:52,963 
- Hi, I'm Clara.
- What's with the Nazi salute?

496
00:52:53,047 --> 00:52:55,880 
I'm Simon and I'm Asperger's.

497
00:52:55,967 --> 00:52:59,323 
That's why people can't touch me.

498
00:52:59,407 --> 00:53:04,322 
- Is he your boyfriend?
- No, absolutely not.

499
00:53:04,407 --> 00:53:07,126 
- What did you bring?
- Tequila!

500
00:53:07,207 --> 00:53:09,721 
Pictionary!

501
00:53:09,807 --> 00:53:11,923 
Come on, Simon.

502
00:53:12,007 --> 00:53:15,795 
Let's play.
Ever play Tequila Pictionary?

503
00:53:15,887 --> 00:53:19,323 
It's really easy...

504
00:53:20,407 --> 00:53:24,639 
- Do you want one?
- I told you, they have to be round.

505
00:53:24,727 --> 00:53:30,518 
- The crusts are the best part.
- There are glasses under there.

506
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:32,882 
Right there, grab them.

507
00:53:32,967 --> 00:53:38,997 
- All right if I help myself?
- Sure. - Melt, Simon?

508
00:53:45,407 --> 00:53:47,238 
An ice cream!

509
00:53:53,087 --> 00:53:55,123 
Grass.

510
00:53:55,207 --> 00:53:59,086 
A palm tree. I was first.

511
00:53:59,767 --> 00:54:01,246 
I was first.

512
00:54:15,207 --> 00:54:20,235 
Hi, Mom. Just wondered
if Simon was there.

513
00:54:20,327 --> 00:54:23,478 
No, don't worry,
he'll find his way home.

514
00:54:23,567 --> 00:54:27,242 
I am calm. Yes, I'm calm.

515
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:30,125 
Bye.

516
00:54:34,527 --> 00:54:38,805 
- A ball.
- The moon, the sun...

517
00:54:38,887 --> 00:54:42,118 
A pizza?

518
00:54:42,207 --> 00:54:44,243 
Venus, Jupiter.

519
00:54:44,327 --> 00:54:47,717 
A rock, with two... balls!

520
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:52,005 
These are also supposed
to be completely round.

521
00:54:52,087 --> 00:54:55,921 
- Time's up.
- What is it?

522
00:54:56,007 --> 00:54:58,680 
It's water, can't you tell?

523
00:54:58,767 --> 00:55:03,682 
Oxygen and two hydrogen atoms.

524
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:06,565 
You are seriously disturbed!

525
00:55:06,647 --> 00:55:11,243 
- That's not water.
- You could draw an island, waves...

526
00:55:11,327 --> 00:55:18,517 
- It doesn't have to be so advanced.
- Penalty shot.

527
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:21,246 
Penalty, penalty...

528
00:55:26,447 --> 00:55:29,723 
What did he do?

529
00:55:38,327 --> 00:55:43,117 
Why are you sitting out here?
Are you sad?

530
00:55:43,207 --> 00:55:48,440 
- What makes you think that?
- You look sad.

531
00:55:48,527 --> 00:55:53,078 
Sometimes people look sad
even though they're happy.

532
00:55:53,167 --> 00:55:57,957 
Once, when Sam was picked
Most Valuable Player, my mom cried.

533
00:55:58,047 --> 00:56:00,880 
But she was happy.

534
00:56:00,967 --> 00:56:04,164 
But she still cried.

535
00:56:04,807 --> 00:56:08,322 
- Right.
- You're not sad anymore?

536
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:15,358 
- It's not that simple, Simon.
- It is. Either you're sad or happy.

537
00:56:15,447 --> 00:56:17,915 
No.

538
00:56:20,327 --> 00:56:26,323 
I'm sad about someone who used to
make me so happy, who's an idiot.

539
00:56:26,407 --> 00:56:33,006 
You have to replace him with
a new quantity, like in an equation.

540
00:56:36,367 --> 00:56:38,244 
Are you happy?

541
00:56:40,367 --> 00:56:44,121 
I'm happy I'm out here with you.

542
00:56:47,367 --> 00:56:52,521 
- I don't understand.
- I like you.

543
00:56:52,607 --> 00:56:57,965 
Not that. How can you go
from happy to sad like that?

544
00:57:01,767 --> 00:57:09,242 
Imagine that you have
a circle, like this. Round.

545
00:57:09,327 --> 00:57:14,765 
And up here, at the top,
is the saddest you can get.

546
00:57:14,847 --> 00:57:21,195 
Then you're less sad.
You're almost okay. You're fine.

547
00:57:21,287 --> 00:57:26,486 
You're happy, psyched,
almost in a state of euphoria,

548
00:57:26,567 --> 00:57:32,039 
and then just insanely happy
when you reach the top.

549
00:57:32,127 --> 00:57:37,804 
On the other side of sad.
It's like it couldn't get any better.

550
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:44,520 
But it's so easy to tip
over the edge and go sad.

551
00:57:48,527 --> 00:57:51,678 
- I understand.
- You do?

552
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:55,362 
Yes. Someone you liked
stopped liking you,

553
00:57:55,447 --> 00:57:58,325 
and that made you
tip over to the other side.

554
00:57:58,407 --> 00:58:02,161 
Tip over from happy to sad.

555
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:08,160 
You explain things so I understand.
Only you and Sam do that.

556
00:58:08,247 --> 00:58:14,163 
- Good, maybe we're not all different.
- You are. He's order, you're chaos.

557
00:58:14,247 --> 00:58:17,717 
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

558
00:58:17,807 --> 00:58:23,916 
Just so you know,
I can only fall for good-looking guys.

559
00:58:24,007 --> 00:58:26,805 
Hold on.

560
00:58:28,047 --> 00:58:30,436 
- Here.
- Who's that?

561
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:34,236 
My brother Sam.
Is he good-looking or not?

562
00:58:36,247 --> 00:58:39,205 
- Possibly...
- You think so?

563
00:58:39,287 --> 00:58:42,996 
Because if you do,
you can meet him.

564
00:58:48,207 --> 00:58:51,882 
Let's ask Lisa and Clara.

565
00:58:52,887 --> 00:58:55,355 
Let's ask Lisa and Clara.

566
00:59:43,287 --> 00:59:46,120 
Hello...

567
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:49,438 
- How are you?
- Fine.

568
00:59:49,527 --> 00:59:53,645 
- What are you doing here?
- Simon has disappeared.

569
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:58,084 
- I see.
- Have you heard anything?

570
00:59:58,167 --> 01:00:00,237 
No, sorry.

571
01:00:11,127 --> 01:00:13,925 
- Sorry, but...
- What do you want?

572
01:00:14,007 --> 01:00:16,805 
It might have something to do with you.

573
01:00:16,887 --> 01:00:20,357 
- That's not my problem, right?
- Yes... or no. I don't know.

574
01:00:20,447 --> 01:00:25,123 
I don't know what to do about you,
or about us...

575
01:00:25,207 --> 01:00:27,960 
There is no "us" anymore.

576
01:00:28,047 --> 01:00:32,677 
Easy for you to say. You were just
looking for a reason to break it off

577
01:00:32,767 --> 01:00:35,327 
so you could meet new guys.

578
01:00:35,407 --> 01:00:38,843 
You're the one in a relationship
with your brother.

579
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:43,284 
Come back when you've got
something better to offer.

580
01:00:46,527 --> 01:00:50,566 
The shirt is kind of...
But that can be changed.

581
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:53,445 
Are you in love with him now?

582
01:00:53,527 --> 01:00:56,837 
You can't fall in love with a picture.

583
01:00:56,927 --> 01:00:59,600 
- Yes you can.
- No, It doesn't work like that.

584
01:00:59,687 --> 01:01:03,123 
You have to click, like in the movies.

585
01:01:03,207 --> 01:01:08,406 
I don't watch romantic movies.
Do you want to meet him?

586
01:01:08,487 --> 01:01:12,639 
What's this?
"I'm Sam, Simon's big brother."

587
01:01:12,727 --> 01:01:17,278 
"If you're reading this, he's probably
lost or gotten into trouble."

588
01:01:17,367 --> 01:01:20,962 
"It's not his fault,
he has Asperger's."

589
01:01:21,047 --> 01:01:26,360 
"Call me and I'll come pick him up
and fix whatever he broke."

590
01:01:26,447 --> 01:01:31,475 
- How sweet!
- Do you want to meet him now?

591
01:01:31,567 --> 01:01:34,081 
- No...
- You want to.

592
01:01:34,167 --> 01:01:37,364 
- Yes...
- You said yes.

593
01:01:37,447 --> 01:01:41,042 
- I don't know. Where are you going?
- Home to Sam.

594
01:01:41,127 --> 01:01:47,600 
- What about me?
- You're going on a date.

595
01:01:47,687 --> 01:01:52,397 
- Simon!
- He's cute... really sweet.

596
01:02:07,927 --> 01:02:10,441 
I'm home.

597
01:02:16,407 --> 01:02:21,117 
- Where were you? I was worried.
- I've been with Jennifer.

598
01:02:21,207 --> 01:02:25,598 
- Who?
- Your new girlfriend.

599
01:02:29,447 --> 01:02:32,564 
Sam? She's your total opposite.

600
01:02:32,647 --> 01:02:35,002 
She explains things so I understand.

601
01:02:35,087 --> 01:02:38,875 
- Apart from that, you're opposites.
- I don't want to meet her.

602
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:42,118 
You need someone who does
the dishes and who likes me.

603
01:02:42,207 --> 01:02:46,598 
- She likes me, so she'll love you.
- I want to be alone.

604
01:02:46,687 --> 01:02:52,398 
You didn't call all day!
Don't you realize how worried I was?

605
01:02:54,047 --> 01:02:58,916 
- She wants to go on a date with you.
- I don't want to see anyone.

606
01:02:59,007 --> 01:03:02,317 
- Is that so hard to understand?
- Where are you going?

607
01:03:02,407 --> 01:03:05,365 
- To Mom and Dad's.
- Why?

608
01:03:05,447 --> 01:03:08,564 
- Because.
- Are you angry, Sam?

609
01:03:08,647 --> 01:03:13,243 
- You sound like you're Asperger's.
- Butt out of this!

610
01:03:13,327 --> 01:03:18,606 
You can't even take care of yourself!
Can't you see how upset I am?

611
01:03:18,687 --> 01:03:24,717 
No, you can't because you're
the one with Asperger's, you idiot!

612
01:03:24,807 --> 01:03:27,844 
You're yelling, Sam. Sam!

613
01:03:27,927 --> 01:03:33,047 
- Don't touch me!
- Sam? Sam...

614
01:03:33,127 --> 01:03:35,687 
Sam! Sam! Sam!

615
01:06:03,767 --> 01:06:06,406 
I'm an idiot!

616
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:12,040 
<i>It was so obvious...</i>
<i>They're opposites!</i>

617
01:06:12,127 --> 01:06:16,245 
<i>So if Jennifer wants to go on a date,</i>
<i>then Sam won't want to.</i>

618
01:06:16,327 --> 01:06:18,682 
<i>I have to complete my mission.</i>

619
01:06:18,767 --> 01:06:24,125 
<i>If you get the magnets close enough,</i>
<i>science will take care of the rest.</i>

620
01:06:27,407 --> 01:06:32,959 
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

621
01:06:35,127 --> 01:06:38,722 
I want every single movie there is
about two people falling in love.

622
01:06:38,807 --> 01:06:42,322 
- All of Hugh Grant's movies.
- All of them...?

623
01:06:55,527 --> 01:06:59,805 
Great, I've got an incoming call.

624
01:06:59,887 --> 01:07:03,562 
Hi, chef.
I'm in need of some catering.

625
01:07:06,167 --> 01:07:11,799 
Team, we have to stick together.
I chose you because I believe in you.

626
01:07:11,887 --> 01:07:15,277 
That, and you're the only people
I know. Will you tempt fate?

627
01:07:15,367 --> 01:07:18,723 
Will you help me?

628
01:07:18,807 --> 01:07:20,718 
Synchronize!

629
01:07:24,927 --> 01:07:28,681 
Good... Just like in a Romcom.

630
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:35,359 
- Not until 10 pm on the dot.
- I have to practice.

631
01:07:35,447 --> 01:07:36,596 
Just one.

632
01:07:50,287 --> 01:07:53,916 
- What do you want it for?
- An equation.

633
01:08:03,567 --> 01:08:07,242 
- Sam.
- It's Thursday, so I figured...

634
01:08:07,327 --> 01:08:12,447 
No more movie nights.
I'm playing basketball today.

635
01:08:12,527 --> 01:08:14,882 
Sam?

636
01:08:32,887 --> 01:08:36,402 
What? Help! Help!

637
01:09:15,127 --> 01:09:18,278 
Could you please get me out of this?

638
01:09:18,367 --> 01:09:20,039 
Get me out.

639
01:09:21,567 --> 01:09:24,798 
- For me?
- Hello?

640
01:09:26,207 --> 01:09:29,916 
- Is that you, Sam?
- Who the hell are you?

641
01:09:30,007 --> 01:09:31,998 
This is fun!

642
01:09:32,087 --> 01:09:34,555 
Why are you in a sack?

643
01:09:36,487 --> 01:09:40,400 
Simon, you bastard!
I'm going to kill you!

644
01:09:40,487 --> 01:09:44,002 
He said I was going on a date.

645
01:09:44,087 --> 01:09:46,476 
Date? What date?

646
01:09:55,247 --> 01:09:59,877 
- Maybe we can call him?
- He doesn't have a phone.

647
01:10:13,487 --> 01:10:17,036 
- You're late!
- Yeah yeah, love takes time.

648
01:10:17,127 --> 01:10:21,598 
- No, hurry up.
- Yeah...

649
01:10:24,287 --> 01:10:31,284 
- I don't think he's coming.
- Go ahead, I'll wait.

650
01:10:33,327 --> 01:10:36,000 
What the hell...?

651
01:10:40,287 --> 01:10:46,635 
- What was that?
- Jennifer? Flowers from Sam.

652
01:10:46,727 --> 01:10:50,402 
Thanks, they're beautiful.

653
01:10:52,887 --> 01:10:56,197 
"You had me at hello. Love, Sam."

654
01:10:58,327 --> 01:11:02,639 
We're all set up on the hill.
<i>S'il vous plaît!</i>

655
01:11:07,447 --> 01:11:12,965 
- It's lovely...
- Come with me to the hill.

656
01:11:29,287 --> 01:11:32,916 
<i>Une petite...</i> finger food.

657
01:11:33,007 --> 01:11:35,567 
S'il vous plaît!

658
01:11:36,967 --> 01:11:40,164 
This is great.

659
01:11:40,247 --> 01:11:42,966 
I love kiwis.

660
01:12:02,447 --> 01:12:04,756 
Cheers.

661
01:12:09,447 --> 01:12:12,678 
- Okay, what do you want?
- What?

662
01:12:12,767 --> 01:12:17,921 
I get it, you were
in on this from the start.

663
01:12:18,007 --> 01:12:22,797 
- What do you want from us?
- I'm here for Simon's sake.

664
01:12:22,887 --> 01:12:27,119 
I like him, he's great.
He said if I liked him, I'd love you.

665
01:12:27,207 --> 01:12:31,564 
There are no similarities,
and no one really likes Simon.

666
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:37,165 
- How can you say that?
- Of course I like him.

667
01:12:37,247 --> 01:12:41,240 
- But he only cares about himself.
- That's so not true.

668
01:12:41,327 --> 01:12:45,798 
He wants us to like each other
and said I'm a thousand times better.

669
01:12:45,887 --> 01:12:48,355 
- 93 7.
- What?

670
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:52,486 
- He thinks you're 93 7 times better.
- Who cares?

671
01:12:52,567 --> 01:12:59,279 
- I care!
- He's doing this for himself.

672
01:12:59,367 --> 01:13:02,200 
Just look at what he's done.

673
01:13:02,287 --> 01:13:05,006 
He's arranged for a ton of food.

674
01:13:05,087 --> 01:13:11,925 
There are lights, wine, roses...
It's the ultimate romantic movie.

675
01:13:12,007 --> 01:13:14,919 
Don't you realize what you mean to him?

676
01:13:19,327 --> 01:13:22,364 
He even got us live music.

677
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:29,483 
- Shit, how can you not see it?
- Yeah, but...

678
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:33,439 
- I don't know, I ...
- What don't you know?

679
01:13:33,527 --> 01:13:37,440 
- I'm used to him.
- So he does this all the time?

680
01:13:37,527 --> 01:13:40,200 
No, but I ...

681
01:13:53,607 --> 01:13:59,364 
If you could have anything you wanted,
what would you wish for?

682
01:14:06,607 --> 01:14:09,758 
- A pet, maybe?
- A pet?

683
01:14:09,847 --> 01:14:15,046 
Something unusual, maybe a monkey.

684
01:14:15,127 --> 01:14:21,282 
So if I could have anything
I'd wish for a monkey?

685
01:14:28,967 --> 01:14:30,923 
Cheers.

686
01:14:33,767 --> 01:14:38,557 
<i>Sometimes bad gives way to good.</i>
<i>That's a kind of balance, as well...</i>

687
01:14:38,647 --> 01:14:44,085 
<i>Maybe you need a special kind of</i>
<i>intelligence to comprehend this?</i>

688
01:14:44,167 --> 01:14:46,556 
<i>Maybe you need Asperger's.</i>

689
01:14:46,647 --> 01:14:50,606 
<i>Maybe there are feelings in space...</i>

690
01:15:03,247 --> 01:15:06,717 
That was a great surprise.

691
01:15:06,807 --> 01:15:10,117 
It's not over yet. Where is Jennifer?
Are you together now?

692
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:13,882 
- No, but we may be friends.
- What?

693
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:21,885 
- But you have to get together.
- We're not getting together.

694
01:15:21,967 --> 01:15:26,563 
- Calm down.
- Yes, yes, yes...

695
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:32,085 
You have to get together, Sam.
You do.

696
01:15:34,767 --> 01:15:39,921 
- She's gone home...
- You scared her off! - Jennifer!

697
01:15:40,007 --> 01:15:43,397 
- Jennifer?!
- Calm down.

698
01:15:44,687 --> 01:15:46,643 
Calm down!

699
01:15:53,767 --> 01:15:56,076 
Simon!

700
01:15:56,167 --> 01:15:57,202 
Simon!!

701
01:17:30,207 --> 01:17:34,803 
Things change, Simon, and it's not
necessarily someone's fault.

702
01:17:34,887 --> 01:17:37,720 
Everything changes.

703
01:17:38,807 --> 01:17:41,446 
Not me.

704
01:17:41,527 --> 01:17:46,726 
You don't have to do
all those things for me.

705
01:17:46,807 --> 01:17:51,085 
I had it all figured out.
You're supposed to be together now.

706
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:54,637 
Why do you want us to be together?

707
01:17:56,207 --> 01:18:01,804 
- I don't want her to go away.
- That doesn't mean she'll go away.

708
01:18:01,887 --> 01:18:07,007 
Sure it does. If she doesn't like you,
she won't like me.

709
01:18:07,087 --> 01:18:12,844 
I'm 93 7 times worse than you...
And now she's gone.

710
01:18:14,647 --> 01:18:18,765 
I'm not the one who's gone, you are.

711
01:18:18,847 --> 01:18:22,965 
- I'm not gone, I'm right here.
- So am I .

712
01:18:23,047 --> 01:18:24,400 
Hi there.

713
01:18:28,647 --> 01:18:32,435 
I'm not going anywhere.

714
01:18:32,527 --> 01:18:34,597 
I like you.

715
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:42,279 
Hey, come on out...

716
01:18:42,367 --> 01:18:45,279 
- Why?
- Because.

717
01:18:45,367 --> 01:18:48,518 
- Why?
- Because.

718
01:18:49,487 --> 01:18:53,446 
- What are you doing?
- What?

719
01:18:54,807 --> 01:18:58,004 
Can I give you a hug now or what?

720
01:18:58,087 --> 01:19:02,205 
- Why?
- Because I want to.

721
01:19:02,287 --> 01:19:05,802 
For the lovely dinner.

722
01:19:05,887 --> 01:19:11,996 
For the lovely evening, you and me
and everything. May I?

723
01:19:12,087 --> 01:19:17,480 
- I don't want anyone touching me.
- Can't you tell? We already are.
