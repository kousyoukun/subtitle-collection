{\an8}"里格"为距离单位 1里格约等于4.8公里

7
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,900
追上他们!
Abgurid!

8
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,880
现在就发动攻击!

9
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,400
趁那群矮人睡觉的时候杀死他们

10
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,620
不行

11
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,380
有怪兽在守护他们

12
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,990
我们要在路上截杀他们

13
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,550
他们在多古尔都集结

14
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,060

00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,310
力量也日渐强大

21
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,940
你将带领我的军队

22
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,000
那橡木盾怎么办?

23
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,630
战争即将爆发

24
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,770
你答应过我要取他项上人头的

25
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,770
死亡将笼罩一切

26
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,840
我们不追杀了吗?

27
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,700
博格!

28
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,790
我要交给你一个任务

29
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,690
你还渴望矮人的血吗?

Wait there.

Quiet, Dwarves.

33
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,460
莱戈拉斯大人
Legolas my lord.

34
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:12,010
蜘蛛都死了吗?

35
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:14,910
嗯 但还会来更多

36
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,950
它们越来越大胆了

37
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:28,580
这把剑来自刚多林

38
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,550
由诺多精灵铸造

39
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,160
把他们带走!
Take them away!

40
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:06,580
关上大门

41
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:29,030
那矮人为什么盯着你看 陶瑞尔?

42
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:31,060
谁知道?

43
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,880
在矮人里 他还挺高的

44
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,690
你觉得呢?

45
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,660
比一般的高...

46
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:41,560
但还是一样丑

47
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:03,130
愿你死于烈焰!

唾弃他的坟墓!
Ish kakhfe ai'd dur rugnu!

49
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:02,080
门口有精灵防守

50
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:05,260
不是所有门都有... 跟我来!

51
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:06,330
回到我身旁

52
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:43,070
{\an8}辛达精灵语 "Mereth"意为"宴会, 盛会" "Gilith"意为"星空, 群星区"

53
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:58,920
他们逃跑了
They are gone.

54
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:41,550
快去追矮人!
Find the dwarves!

杀了她! 杀了那个女精灵!

60

矮人要逃了!
The dwarves are escaping!

61
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:49,140
追!

62
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:23,420
等等!

63
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:28,190
别杀他 留活口

64
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:33,130
追 宰了他们!

65
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,050
别让他们跑了!
Don't let them go away!

66
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:43,660
我不跟狗讲话 女精灵!

67
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:56,670
够了!

68
01:16:57,140 --> 01:16:58,960
陶瑞尔 退下!

69
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,780
立刻退下

70
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,850
把门关上!

71
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:51,330
把门封上 这是国王的命令

72
01:18:52,210 --> 01:18:53,380
陶瑞尔怎么办?

73
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:57,380
她怎么了?

74
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:58,990
她跑进森林里了...

75
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:01,600
穿着铠甲 带着弓箭

76
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:03,790
还没回来

77
01:19:27,450 --> 01:19:29,400
矮人的血!

78
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:30,820
他们来过这儿!

79
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:34,100
还有另一种气味...

80
01:19:38,090 --> 01:19:39,720
人的味道!

81
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:46,910
他们找到了去湖对岸的方法

82
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:22,540
我以为你是奥克

83
01:36:23,010 --> 01:36:24,410
如果我是奥克...

84
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:26,070
你早就死了

85
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:51,760
跟我回去吧...

86
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,740
他会原谅你的

87
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,050
如果我回去

88
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:58,140
我不会原谅自己

89
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:29,490
朋友
mellon,

90
01:53:22,620 --> 01:53:25,980
藏匿于此的恶魔...

91

我命你现身!

92
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:33,160
我命你现出真身!

93
01:53:48,090 --> 01:53:51,760
藏匿于此的恶魔...
Ce na ulco sis nurtaina...

94
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:54,810
我命你现身!
I ettuluvas caninye!

95
01:53:54,890 --> 01:53:57,340
巫师来了

96
01:53:57,720 --> 01:53:59,590
他在解除咒语...

97
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:01,290
他会找到我们的!

98
01:54:01,790 --> 01:54:04,550
没错... 他会的

99
02:09:45,060 --> 02:09:49,320
你来得太晚了 巫师!

100
02:09:50,110 --> 02:09:51,980
已经完成了

101
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:01,890
他无处不在...

102
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:05,620
我们军团遍地!

103
02:10:20,010 --> 02:10:22,110
结束了

104
02:10:28,030 --> 02:10:29,340
给我追

105
02:10:50,290 --> 02:10:53,370
巫师 没有什么光芒...

106
02:10:55,730 --> 02:10:59,030
可以战胜黑暗

107
02:26:50,470 --> 02:26:54,940
可恶的小矮人就在附近
The filthy dwarf rats are somewhere here.

108
02:26:55,140 --> 02:26:58,040
我闻到了
I can smell them.

109
02:31:55,430 --> 02:31:57,630
橡木盾不在这!

110
02:31:58,690 --> 02:31:59,670
撤退!

111
02:32:00,070 --> 02:32:01,370
桥上集合!

112
02:32:59,290 --> 02:33:00,420
阿塞拉斯草(即王叶草)!
Athelas!

113
02:33:03,370 --> 02:33:05,120
阿塞拉斯草...
Athelas...

114
02:35:21,320 --> 02:35:25,030
愿将赐于我之福转给他
May the blessing that was given to me be sent from me to him,

115
02:35:25,250 --> 02:35:27,700
愿死神远离他

愿将赐于我之福转给他

121
02:35:47,710 --> 02:35:49,770

124
02:41:40,600 --> 02:41:43,140
送口信去多古尔都...

125
02:41:43,510 --> 02:41:46,300
橡木盾到达孤山了!

126
02:41:57,160 --> 02:41:58,120

你们! 跟我来

128
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:43,100
{\a5}那人身携诅咒的印记...

129
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:22,800
{\a5}我曾越过森林漫步...

130
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:31,600
{\a5}永恒的光芒渗透气息

131
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:41,700
{\a5}徜徉夜空 人间消散...

132
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:49,500
{\a5}哦我的爱啊 我的爱

133
02:38:32,590 --> 02:38:41,350
{\a5}徜徉夜空 人间消散...

134
02:38:41,750 --> 02:38:47,650
{\a5}哦我的爱啊 我的爱

片尾曲 I see fire
词曲 演唱 Ed Sheeran

141
02:56:07,010 --> 02:56:13,870
# 哦 山峦下的迷雾之眼 #
# Oh, misty eye of the mountain below #

142
02:56:15,580 --> 02:56:21,330
# 愿小心看顾我兄弟之灵 #
# Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls #

143
02:56:22,890 --> 02:56:30,380
# 若天际遍布烈焰灰烟 #
# And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke #

144
02:56:31,780 --> 02:56:37,820
# 请长久守护都林子民 #
# Keep watching over Durin's sons #

145
02:56:50,890 --> 02:56:54,200
# 若一切注定焚尽 #
# If this is to end in fire #

146
02:56:54,200 --> 02:56:57,420
# 那我们也将同赴火海 #
# Then we should all burn together #

147
02:56:57,420 --> 02:57:03,490
# 看烈焰升腾入空 点亮夜霭 #
# Watch the flames climb high into the night #

148
02:57:03,990 --> 02:57:07,280
# 呼唤父辈 #
# Calling out father, oh, #

149
02:57:07,280 --> 02:57:10,200
# 与我们并肩 #
# Stand by and we will #

150
02:57:10,200 --> 02:57:13,780
# 望猩红火光满眼 #
# Watch the flames burn auburn on #

151
02:57:13,780 --> 02:57:16,200
# 席卷群山 #
# The mountain side high #

152
02:57:22,280 --> 02:57:25,850
# 若今夜注定殒命 #
# And if we should die tonight #

153
02:57:25,850 --> 02:57:29,110
# 那我们必将共赴黄泉 #
# Then we should all die together #

154
02:57:29,110 --> 02:57:35,360
# 最后一场筵席 美酒斟满 #
# Raise a glass of wine for the last time #

155
02:57:35,500 --> 02:57:38,880
# 呼唤父辈 #
# Calling out father, oh, #

156
02:57:38,880 --> 02:57:41,800
# 我们将准备 #
# Prepare as we will #

157
02:57:41,800 --> 02:57:45,280
# 望猩红火光满眼 #
# Watch the flames burn auburn on #

158
02:57:45,280 --> 02:57:47,500
# 席卷群山 #
# The mountain side #

159
02:57:47,980 --> 02:57:53,770
# 荒芜之风呼啸而来 #
# Desolation comes upon the sky #

160
02:57:54,040 --> 02:57:56,100
# 我目睹烈焰 #
# Now I see fire #

161
02:57:57,910 --> 02:58:00,420
# 游走山腹 #
# Inside the mountain #

162
02:58:00,420 --> 02:58:02,530
# 我目睹烈焰 #
# I see fire #

163
02:58:04,270 --> 02:58:06,930
# 焚毁林木 #
# Burning the trees #

164
02:58:06,930 --> 02:58:10,260
# 我目睹烈焰 #
# And I see fire #

165
02:58:10,810 --> 02:58:13,230
# 吞噬生灵 #

166

# 我目睹烈焰 #
# I see fire #

167
02:58:17,040 --> 02:58:19,480
# 如血色摇曳 #
# Blood in the breeze #

168
02:58:19,750 --> 02:58:24,610
# 多希望我能被铭记 #
# And I hope that you remember me #

169
02:58:34,950 --> 02:58:38,470
# 若同伴相继倒地 #
# Oh, should my people fall #

170
02:58:38,470 --> 02:58:41,120
# 那我也定会誓死追随 #
# Then surely I'll do the same #

171
02:58:41,120 --> 02:58:44,920
# 孤山内殿堂幽深 #
# Confined in mountain halls #

172
02:58:44,920 --> 02:58:47,660
# 我们与龙焰一同吐息 #
# We got too close to the flame #

173
02:58:48,130 --> 02:58:51,430
# 呼唤父辈 #
# Calling out father, oh, #

174
02:58:51,430 --> 02:58:54,410
# 你我紧紧扶依 #
# Hold fast and we will #

175
02:58:54,410 --> 02:58:57,900
# 望猩红火光满眼 #
# Watch the flames burn auburn on #

176
02:58:57,900 --> 02:59:00,220
# 席卷群山 #
# The mountain side #

177
02:59:00,760 --> 02:59:06,440
# 荒芜之风呼啸而来 #
# Desolation comes upon the sky #

178
02:59:06,670 --> 02:59:08,610
# 我目睹烈焰 #
# Now I see fire #

179
02:59:10,800 --> 02:59:13,100

# I see fire #

185
02:59:29,650 --> 02:59:32,170
# 如血色摇曳 #

186
02:59:32,420 --> 02:59:37,450
# 多希望我能被铭记 #
# And I hope that you remember me #

187
02:59:37,900 --> 02:59:41,540
# 若暗夜熊熊燃烧 #
# And if the night is burning #

188
02:59:41,630 --> 02:59:44,160
# 我只能闭上双眼 #
# I will cover my eyes #

189
02:59:44,160 --> 02:59:47,600
# 因黑暗重归之时 #
# For if the dark returns #

190
02:59:47,600 --> 02:59:50,650
# 我的兄弟方已不再 #
# Then my brothers will die #

191
02:59:50,860 --> 02:59:54,100
# 看天空破碎跌落 #
# And as the sky is falling down #

192
02:59:54,100 --> 02:59:57,320
# 坠入这孤寂之所 #
# It crashed into this lonely town #

193
02:59:57,590 --> 03:00:00,400
# 看邪影笼罩大地 #
# And with that shadow upon the ground #

194
03:00:00,400 --> 03:00:03,760
# 耳边有子民惊泣 #
# I hear my people screaming out #

我快要渴死了 快点倒酒!
I'm dying of thirst over here. C'mon, come on!

214
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,460
- 给你  - 谢了
- Here you are.  - Thank you kindly.

215
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,880
- 看着点!  - 对不起 亲爱的

217

斯塔德勒老爷
Master. Stadle.

218
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,720
介意我坐这里吗?
Mind if I join you?

219
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,680
我要一样的
I'll have the same.

220
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,020
做个自我介绍吧 我叫甘道夫
I should introduce myself. My name is Gandalf

221
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,730
灰袍甘道夫
Gandalf the Grey.

222
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,980
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

223
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,480
是啊! 真巧啊 在这里遇到你
Well, now! This is a fine chance.

224
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,370
不知梭林・橡木盾来布理有何贵干?
What brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?

225
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,910
我听说 有人看见我父亲
I received word, that my father

226
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,650
在登兰德附近的
has been seen wandering

227
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,920
野外出现过
the wilds near Dunland.

228
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,840
我去找过
I went looking,

229
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,090
没有他的踪迹
found no sign of him.

230
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,670
瑟莱因...
Thrain...

231
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,500
你和其他人一样
You're like the others,

232
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,140
觉得他死了
you think he's dead.

233
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,790
我没有参加墨瑞亚战役
I was not at the battle of Moria.

234
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,680
你是没有...
No...

235
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,690
但我在场
but I was.

236
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,550
我的祖父...
My grandfather...

237
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,680
瑟罗尔...
Thror...

238
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,930
被斩首了
was slain.

239
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,240
不!
No!

240
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,190
父亲!
Father!

241
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,060
待在这里
Stay back.

242
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,770
不 我要和你一起战斗
No, I'll fight with you.

243
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,460
阿佐格就是想杀光我们
Azog means to kill us all.

244
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,860
一个接着一个 他会断送都林的血脉
One by one, he will destroy the line of Durin.

245
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,700
但有我在 他就杀不了我的儿子
But by mine's life, he shall not take my son.

246
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,260
你必须待在这里
You must stay here.

247
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,210
我父亲冲向了黯溪门
My father led the charge towards the Dimrill gate.

248
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,210
再也没回来
He never returned.

249
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,520
父亲!
Father!

250
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,190
他们告诉我 "瑟莱因死了"
"Thrain is gone," they told me.

251
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,950
和其他人一样战死了
He is one of the fallen.

252
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,230
但战争结束后 我搜索了整片战场
But at the end of that battle I searched among the slain,

253
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,650
翻查每一具尸体
to the last body.

254
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,160
里面没有我的父亲
My father was not among the dead.

255
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,560
梭林 很长一段时间以来
Thorin, It has been a long time

256
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,280
关于瑟莱因的消息
since anything but rumour

257
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,410
全都是流言
was heard of Thrain.

258
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,370
他还活着
He still lives.

259
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,050
我能肯定
I am sure of it.

260
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,100
你祖父戴的那枚戒指
The ring your grandfather wore,

261
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,470
就是多年前赠予矮人国王的
one of the seven that given to the Dwarf-lords

262
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,400
七枚之一...
many years ago...

263
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,690
现在在哪儿?
what became of it?

264
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,180
他在战前把戒指交给了我父亲
He gave it to my father before they went into battles.

265
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,330
所以瑟莱因是戴着戒指...
So, Thrain was wearing it when he...

266
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,080
失踪的
When he went missing.

267
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,370
- 就这样吧  - 给你
- That's that, then.  - Here you are.

268
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,340
我知道父亲在墨瑞亚战役之前
I know my father came to see you

269
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,090
去见过你
before the battle of Moria.

270
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,950
你对他说了什么?
What did you say to him?

271
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,120
我劝他出兵埃瑞博
I urged him to march upon Erebor.

272
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,710
统领矮人的七支军队
To reign the seven armies of the dwarves.

273
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,750
打败巨龙 夺回孤山
To destroy the dragon and take back the Lonely Mountain.

274
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,980
而现在我也要对你说同样的话
And I would say the same to you,

275
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,230
去夺回你们的家园
take back your homeland.

276
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,240
今天的相遇不是巧合 对吧 甘道夫?
This is no chance meeting, is it, Gandalf?

277
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,410
不
No.

278
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,700
不是的
It is not.

279
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,600
我很担心孤山的事
The Lonely Mountain troubles me,

280
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,530
梭林 那条巨龙盘踞在那的时间够长了
Thorin, that dragon has sat there long enough.

281
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,820
总有一天
Sooner or later,

282
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,130
黑暗势力会盯上埃瑞博
darker minds will turn towards Erebor.

283
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,070
我途经绿大道时
I ran into some unsavory characters,

284
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,620
碰见了几位不速之客
whilst travelling along the Greenway.

285
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,620
他们把我当成了流浪汉
They mistook me for a vagabond.

286
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,080
我猜他们现在很后悔
I imagine they regretted that.

287
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,810
其中一人身上带着这个
One of them was carrying a message.

288
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,600
这是黑语
It is Black Speech.

289
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,520
一份悬赏布告
A promise of payment.

290
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,980
悬赏什么?
For what?

291
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,860
你的人头
Your head.

292
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,030
有人想要你的命
Someone wants you dead.

293
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,400
梭林 你不能再等了
Thorin, you could wait no longer.

294
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,370
你是都林王室的继承人
You are the heir to the throne of Durin.

295
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,040
召集矮人的军队
Unite the armies of the dwarves.

296
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,360
只要团结起来 你们就有...
Together, you have the might and power...

297
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,590
夺回埃瑞博的力量
to retake Erebor.

298
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,030
召开七大矮人家族的会议
Summon a meeting of the seven dwarf families.

299
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,040
命令他们履行誓言
Demand they stand by their oaths.

300
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,170
这七支军队誓言效忠拥有国王宝石...
The seven armies swore that oath to the one who wields the King's jewel...

301
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,510
阿肯宝石的人
the Arkenstone.

302
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,040
这是唯一能让他们团结起来的东西
It is the only thing that would unite them.

303
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,130
而且我得提醒你一句
And in case you've forgotten,

304
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,690
那颗宝石已经被史矛革偷走了
that jewel was stolen by Smaug.

305
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,610
要是我能帮你拿回来呢?
What if, I were to help you reclaim it?

306
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,410
怎么拿?
How?

307
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,640
阿肯宝石远在千里之外
The Arkenstone lies half a world away.

308
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,400
深埋在喷火的巨龙脚下
Buried beneath the feet of a fire breathing dragon.

309
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,870
是啊
Yes, it does.

310
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,790
所以我们才需要一个飞贼
Which is why we are going to need a burglar.

311
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,630
敌人离我们多远?
How close is the pack?

312
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,430
很近 不超过几里格 但这不是最可怕的
Too close. A couple of leagues, no more. But that's not the worst of it.

313
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,180
- 奥克闻到我们的气味了?  - 还没有 不过也快了
- Have the Orcs picked up our scent?  - Not yet, but they will do.

314
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,320
我们还有个问题
We have another problem.

315
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,600
他们看见你了吗? 他们看见你了?
Did they see you? They saw you?

316
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,850
没有 没看见我
No, that's not it.

317
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,850
那就好 瞧我怎么说的?
Good, what did I tell you?

318
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,450
像老鼠一样安静
Quite as a mouse.

319
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,690
出色的飞贼人选!
Excellent burglar material!

320
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,550
你们听我说
Will you listen.

321
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,570
就不能听我说完吗?
Will you just listen?

322
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,920
我要告诉你们的是 那边还有别的东西
I'm trying to tell you, there is something else out there.

323
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,050
什么样的... 像熊一样的吗?
What form did it take... Like a bear?

324
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,510
是 差不多 不过要大得多!
Ye... yes, yes. But, bigger, much bigger!

325
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,600
你知道这个怪兽?
You knew about this beast?

326
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,580
我觉得我们应该原路返回
I say we double back.

327
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,980
然后被一队奥克追杀?
And be run down by a pack of Orcs?

328
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,940
有座房子...
There is a house...

329
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,590
离这不是太远 我们可以到那里避一避
It's not far from here, where we might take refuge.

330
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,610
房子的主人是敌是友?
Whose house, a friend or a foe?

331
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,160
都不是
Neither 'en.

332
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,120
他要么会帮我们...
He will help us...

333
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,240
要么会杀死我们
or he will kill us.

334
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,750
我们有别的选择吗?
What choice do we have?

335
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,460
没有
None.

336
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,220
快跑!
Run!

337
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,260
这边 快!
This way, quickly!

338
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,560
快跑!
Run!

339
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,150
邦伯 快跑!
Bombur, go!

340
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,410
进房子里
In the house.

341
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,040
快跑!
Run!

342
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,880
快点进来!
Come on, get inside!

343
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,550
把门打开!
Open the door!

344
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,980
快点!
Quickly!

345
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,030
用力推!
Push!

346
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,480
杜瓦林!
Dwalin!

347
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,790
伙计们 加油!
Come on, lads!

348
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,500
那是什么?
What is that?

349
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,840
那是房子的主人
That is our host.

350
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,590
他叫比翁
His name is Beorn.

351
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,970
是个换皮人
And he is a skin-changer.

352
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,600
有的时候 它是只大黑熊
Sometimes, he is a huge black bear.

353
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,340
有的时候 他是个强壮的人
Sometimes, he is a great strong man.

354
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,680
黑熊的行为无法预知
The bear is unpredictable.

355
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,440
但那个人还是讲道理的
But the man can be reasoned with.

356
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,650
但是 他也不是特别喜欢矮人
However, he's not over fond of Dwarves.

357
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,770
他走了
He is leaving.

358
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,980
离那里远点!
Come away from there!

359
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,690
那东西不对劲 
It's not natural. None of it.

360
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,070
他一定是被施了邪恶的咒语
It's obvious, he's under some dark spell.

361
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,320
别犯傻了
Don't be a fool.

362
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,000
除了他自己 没人能对他施法
He is under no enchantment but his own.

363
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,410
好了! 大家睡会儿吧
Alright, now! Get some sleep, all of you.

364
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,050
今晚这里很安全
You will be safe here, tonight.

365
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,890
但愿如此...
I hope...

366
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,340
别怪我!
Don't blame me!

367
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,070
拜托 多瑞!
Come on, Dori!

368
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,900
要我说 我们就该脚底抹油 从后门偷溜
Well, I say we should leg it. Slip out the back way.

369
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,070
无论面对人还是野兽 我才不会逃跑
I'm not running from anyone, beast or no.

370
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,710
这样争论没有意义
There is no point in arguing.

371
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:36,950
没有比翁的帮助
We cannot pass

372
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,050
我们没法穿过森林
through the woodland without Beorn's help!

373
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,700
还没到森林前 就会被追上
We'll be hunted down before we ever get to the forest.

374
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,580
比尔博
Bilbo.

375
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,620
你醒了
There you are.

376
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,500
好了
Now,

377
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,710
这件事需要小心处理
this will require some delicate handling.

378
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,000
必须非常谨慎
We must tread very carefully.

379
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,310
上一个吓到他的人 被撕成了碎片
The last person who startled him was torn to shreds.

380
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,510
我先过去...
I will go first and...

381
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,890
比尔博?
Bilbo?

382
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,900
你和我一起去
You come with me.

383
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,730
- 这主意可行吗?  - 可行
- Is this a good idea?  - Yes.

384
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,230
你们剩下这些人 就等在这里
Now the rest of you, you just wait here,

385
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,020
- 等我的信号再出来  - 好的
- and don't come out untill I give the signal.  - Right.

386
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,520
等你的信号
Wait for the signal.

387
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,070
不要有突然的动作 不要吵闹 更不要一起出来
No sudden moves or loud noises, and don't overcrowd him.

388
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,660
- 两个人一组出来  - 好的
- Only come out in pairs.  - Okay.

389
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,510
事实上 邦伯...
No, actually Bombur...

390
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,180
你一个能抵两个 所以你到时候单独出来
You count as two, so you should come out alone.

391
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,170
记住 一定要等我的信号
Remember, wait for the signal.

392
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,090
等信号 好的
Signal. Right.

393
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,390
会是什么样的信号?
What signal would that be?

394
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,390
- 咳咳  - 你紧张了
- Ahem.  - You're nervous.

395
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,870
紧张? 别胡说
Nervous? What nonsense.

396
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,350
早上好
Good morning.

397
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,670
早上好!
Good morning!

398
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,950
你是谁?
Who are you?

399
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,990
我是甘道夫 灰袍甘道夫
I'm Gandalf. Gandalf the Grey.

400
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,710
从来没听说过
Never heard of him.

401
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,030
我是个巫师
I'm a Wizard.

402
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,150
或许你听说过我同行 赫袍拉达加斯特
Perhaps you've heard of my colleague Radagast the Brown.

403
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,390
他住在幽暗密林的南边界上
He resides in the southern borders of Mirkwood.

404
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,750
你想干什么?
What do you want?

405
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,550
只是想谢谢你的好客
Well, simply to thank you for your hospitality.

406
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,550
你或许有注意到我们昨晚...
You may have noticed that we took refuge...

407
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,470
在你家避了避难
in your lodgings here last night.

408
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,750
这个小家伙...
Who is this...

409
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:47,990
是谁?
little fellow?

410
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,590
这位是巴金斯先生...
Well, this would be Mr. Baggins...

411
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,870
来自夏尔
from the Shire.

412
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,270
他不是个矮人 对吧?
He's not a Dwarf, is he?

413
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,640
什么 不不 他是个霍比特人
Why, no. No, he's a Hobbit.

414
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,790
是个友好的种族 名声可靠
A good family and unimpeachable reputation.

415
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,430
一个半身人和一个巫师
A Halfling and a Wizard.

416
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,590
你们怎么会来这里?
How come you here?

417
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,510
哦 事实上...
Oh, well, the fact is...

418
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,990
我们刚逃脱...
that we've had a bad time of it...

419
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,070
山里那些哥布林
from Goblins in the mountains.

420
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,670
你们接近哥布林干什么?
What did you go near Goblins for?

421
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,440
太愚蠢了
Stupid thing to do.

422
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,910
你说得一点也...
You are absolutely...

423
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,230
- 信号来了 走  - 没错 那...
- There it is. Go.  - right. No, it...

424
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,750
- 走  - 太糟糕了
- Go.  - was terrible.

425
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,510
杜瓦林...
Dwalin...

426
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,750
和巴林
and Balin.

427
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,150
我必须...
And I must...

428
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,390
承认 呃 事实上...
confess that, uh, several...

429
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,910
我们中有几个是矮人
of our group are, in fact, Dwarves.

430
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,550
你把两个矮人称为...
Do you call two...

431
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,030
"有几个"?
"several"?

432
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,840
呃 既然你这么说了...
Well, uh, now you put it that way...

433
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,390
没错 确实有可能...
Yes, there could be more...

434
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,630
不止两个
than two.

435
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,390
走 走
Go, go.

436
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,510
等等 轮到我们了
Wait, that's us.

437
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,270
哦 又来了几位...
Oh, and here are some more...

438
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,270
快乐骑兵团的成员
of our, uh, happy troop.

439
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,710
你把六个人称为"骑兵团"?
And do you call six a "troop"?

440
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,190
你们到底算什么 巡回马戏团?
What are you, a traveling circus?

441
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,030
走
Go.

442
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,350
走 走 走
Go. Go, go.

443
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:21,070
多瑞和欧瑞 为您效劳
Dori and Ori at your service.

444
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,910
我不想要...
I don't...

445
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,150
你们为我效劳
want your service.

446
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,470
完全可以理解
Absolutely understandable.

447
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,390
走
Go.

448
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,630
走
Go.

449
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,070
哦 菲利和基利 差点忘了 没错
Oh, Fili and Kili. I'd quite forgotten. Yes.

450
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,550
哦 是的 还有诺瑞 波弗...
Oh, yes, and Nori, Bofur...

451
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,510
比弗...
Bifur...

452
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,640
和邦伯
and Bombur.

453
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,390
就这些吗?
Is that it?

454
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,710
还有其他人吗?
Are there any more?

455
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,070
啊
Ah.

456
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,750
所以 你就是橡木盾
So, you are the one they call Oakenshield.

457
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,760
告诉我
Tell me,

458
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,550
亵渎者阿佐格为什么在追杀你?
why is Azog the Defiler hunting you?

459
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,590
你怎么知道阿佐格的?
You know of Azog, how?

460
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,630
我的族人是最早住在山里的
My people were the first to live in the mountains,

461
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,590
直到奥克从北方袭来
before the Orcs came down from the north.

462
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,950
亵渎者杀死了我大部分的家人
The Defiler killed most of my family.

463
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,790
还有些沦为他的奴隶
But some he enslaved.

464
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,950
不是为他干活 你明白吗...
Not for work, you understand...

465
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,630
是为了娱乐
but for sport.

466
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,030
把换皮人...
Caging skin-changers...

467
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:38,070
关起来折磨 对他来说是件乐事
and torturing them seemed to amuse him.

468
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,110
还有像你一样的人吗?
There are others like you?

469
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,190
之前有很多
Once there were many.

470
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,150
现在呢?
And now?

471
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,510
只剩我一个了
Now, there's only one.

472
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,270
你们得在...
You need to reach...

473
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:57,190
秋天结束之前到达孤山
the mountain before the last days of autumn.

474
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,790
是啊 要在都林日之前
Before Durin's Day falls, yes.

475
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,880
你们快没时间了
You are running out of time.

476
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,310
所以我们必须穿过幽暗密林
Which is why we must go through Mirkwood.

477
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,360
黑暗笼罩着那片森林
A darkness lies upon that forest.

478
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,630
腐朽之物在树下蔓延
Foul things creep beneath those trees.

479
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:15,150
除非不得已 我是不会冒这个险的
I will not venture there, except in great need.

480
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,390
我们走精灵大道
We will take the Elven Road.

481
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,670
那条路还是安全的
That path is still safe.

482
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,950
"安全"?
"Safe"?

483
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,070
幽暗密林的木精灵和其他同族可不一样
The Wood Elves of Mirkwood are not like their kin.

484
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,070
他们没那么睿智
They're less wise...

485
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,230
却更危险
and more dangerous.

486
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:30,270
但这不重要
But it matters not.

487
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,270
这话什么意思?
What do you mean?

488
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:36,270
这片区域遍布着奥克
These lands are crawling with Orcs.

489
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,710
他们的数量在增长
Their numbers are growing.

490
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,430
而你们只靠走路
And you are on foot.

491
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,590
永远不可能活着到达那片森林
You will never reach...

492
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,390
我不喜欢矮人
I don't like Dwarves.

493
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,070
他们贪婪...
They are greedy...

494
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,790
盲目
and blind.

495
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,150
总是无视那些他们认为...
Blind to the lives of those they deem...

496
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,870
比自己低等的生命
lesser than their own.

497
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,750
不过我更恨奥克
But Orcs, I hate more.

498
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,240
你们需要什么?
What do you need?

499
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,870
进入密林前你们得把我的马放了
You will leave my ponies before you enter the forest.

500
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,830
我答应你
Oh, you have my word.

501
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,190
我们被监视了
We're being watched.

502
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,550
没错
Yes.

503
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,030
奥克不会放弃
The Orcs will not give up.

504
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:38,240
在矮人全死光之前 他们会一直追杀
They will hunt the Dwarves until they see them destroyed.

505
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:41,240
为什么是现在? 是什么让亵渎者离开老窝?
Why now? What has made the Defiler crawl from his hole?

506
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:44,190
墨瑞亚的奥克和多古尔都的法师...
There is an alliance between the Orcs of Moria...

507
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,470
结成了联盟
and the sorcerer in Dol Guldur.

508
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,710
你确定吗?
Are you sure of this?

509
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:48,910
有很多奥克...
Packs have been seen...

510
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,830
在那里集结
gathering there.

511
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,470
数量与日俱增
Each day, more and more come.

512
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,270
你知道那个法师是谁吗?
What do you know of this sorcerer?

513
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,790
人称"死灵法师"的那个
The one they call the Necromancer.

514
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,950
我知道他并非表面的样子
I know he is not what he seems.

515
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:06,110
污秽的东西都会被他的力量吸引
Fell things are drawn to his power.

516
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,550
阿佐格...
Azog pays...

517
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,270
就是为他效忠的
homage to him.

518
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,790
甘道夫
Gandalf.

519
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,590
我们在浪费时间
Time is wasting.

520
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,830
还有件事
There is more.

521
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,270
不久之前 我听到传言...
Not long past, word spread...

522
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:22,550
有人看到亡灵在鲁道尔高附近出没
the dead had been seen walking near the High Fells of Rhudaur.

523
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,670
亡灵?
The dead?

524
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,440
是真的吗?
Is it true?

525
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,480
那些山里有坟墓吗?
Are there tombs in those mountains?

526
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,070
安格玛死后...
When Angmar fell...

527
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,670
北方的大人族把他的尸体和随身物品...
the Men of the North took his body and all that he possessed...

528
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,870
封存于鲁道尔高内
and sealed it within the High Fells of Rhudaur.

529
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,720
他们将他深埋石下
Deep within the rock, they buried him.

530
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,510
墓穴漆黑一片...
In a tomb so dark...

531
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,190
永不见天日
it would never come to light.

532
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:53,870
是的
Yes.

533
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,150
那里面有坟墓
Yes, there are tombs up there.

534
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:02,830
我记得曾有过一股邪恶势力...
I remember a time when a great evil...

535
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,270
统治这片土地
ruled these lands.

536
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,830
他的力量...
One powerful...

537
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,030
能使亡灵回生
enough to raise the dead.

538
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:12,950
如果那个敌人回归中土...
If that enemy has returned to Middle-earth...

539
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,590
我希望你告诉我
I would have you tell me.

540
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,470
白袍萨茹曼说这不可能
Saruman the White says it's not possible.

541
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:23,550
大敌已灭 不可能卷土重来
The enemy was destroyed and will never return.

542
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:27,310
那灰袍甘道夫觉得呢?
And what does Gandalf the Grey say?

543
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,000
快走吧
Go now.

544
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,870
趁现在天亮
While you have the light.

545
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:43,510
你们的敌人就在后面不远处
Your hunters are not far behind.

546
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,030
精灵之门
The Elven Gate.

547
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,510
这就是穿过...
Here lies our path...

548
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,280
幽暗密林的路
through Mirkwood.

549
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,670
附近没有奥克 我们还算幸运
No sign of the Orcs. We have luck on our side.

550
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,030
松开矮种马吧
Set the ponies loose.

551
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,110
让它们回主人那去
Let them return to their master.

552
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,030
这片森林...
This forest...

553
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,640
看起来...
feels...

554
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,350
不太好
sick.

555
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:45,030
好像生了病一样
As if a disease lies upon it.

556
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,150
没有其它路可走了吗?
Is there no way around?

557
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,870
除非我们多走两百英里去北边
Not unless we go 200 miles north.

558
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,190
或者多走两倍距离...
Or twice that distance...

559
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,430
去南边
south.

560
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,710
阴影中有东西蠢蠢欲动 无法看清...
Something moves in the shadows unseen...

561
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,550
它隐藏在深处
hidden from our sight.

562
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,590
积蓄的力量与日俱增
Every day it grows in strength.

563
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,190
要小心死灵法师
Beware the Necromancer.

564
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,830
他并非表面的样子
He is not what he seems.

565
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,830
如果大敌归来 我们一定要知道
If our Enemy has returned, we must know.

566
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,950
去山上的那座坟墓
Go to the tombs in the mountains.

567
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,870
鲁道尔高
The High Fells.

568
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,310
那好吧
So be it.

569
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,230
把我的马留下!
Not my horse!

570
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,470
我还有用!
I need it!

571
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,670
你不是要离开我们吧?
You're not leaving us?

572
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,670
如果不是万不得已 我不会这么做的
I would not do this unless I had to.

573
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,590
你已经变了...
You've changed...

574
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,590
比尔博・巴金斯
Bilbo Baggins.

575
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:26,030
你不再是当初离开夏尔的那个霍比特人了
You're not the same Hobbit as the one who left the Shire.

576
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,520
我得告诉你
I was going to tell you.

577
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,230
我...
I...

578
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:40,190
在哥布林的隧道里 发现了一样东西
found something in the Goblin tunnels.

579
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,800
什么?
Found what?

580
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,390
你发现了什么?
What did you find?

581
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,110
我的勇气
My courage.

582
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,950
好啊 太好了
Good. Well, that's good.

583
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,590
你会需要它的
You'll need it.

584
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,480
我会在前面埃瑞博的望城之处...
I'll be waiting for you at the overlook, before...

585
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,870
等你们
the slopes of Erebor.

586
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,470
注意保管好地图和钥匙
Keep the map and key safe.

587
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,720
没有我 你们先不要进入孤山
Do not enter that mountain without me.

588
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,870
这不仅仅是绿林
This is not the Greenwood alone.

589
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:25,430
森林里有条充满黑暗魔法的小溪
There is a stream in the woods that carries a dark enchantment.

590
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,590
别碰那些水
Do not touch the water.

591
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,230
只能走石头桥
Cross only by the stone bridge.

592
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,070
林中的空气浑浊不堪 使人迷幻
The very air of the forest is heavy with illusion.

593
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:36,040
它会侵入你的意识 让你误入歧途
It'll seek to enter your mind and lead you astray.

594
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,190
"误入歧途"?
"Lead us astray"?

595
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,990
那是什么意思?
What does that mean?

596
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:43,470
你们必须沿着路走 不要走岔路
You must stay on the path. Do not leave it.

597
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,950
如果你们走错了 就永远...
If you do, you'll never...

598
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,470
都找不到路了
find it again.

599
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:51,630
无论发生什么 待在大路上!
No matter what may come, stay on the path!

600
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:55,030
快走吧 我们必须在都林日日落之前到达孤山
Come on. We must reach the mountain before the sun sets on Durin's Day.

601
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,270
- 都林日?  - 我们走
- Durin's Day?  - Let's go.

602
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:59,030
这是我们找到那扇门的唯一机会
It is our one chance to find the hidden door.

603
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,440
这条路拐到了这边
The path turns this way.

604
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,670
这边
This way.

605
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,430
空气 我需要空气
Air. I need air.

606
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,710
我的头 好晕!
My head, it's spinning!

607
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,920
- 我们找到桥了  - 桥
- We found the bridge.  - Bridge.

608
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:07,790
哦
Oh.

609
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,270
我们可以试着游过去
We could try and swim it.

610
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,790
你没有听甘道夫说的话吗?
Didn't you hear what Gandalf said?

611
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:20,070
这座森林被施了黑魔法
A dark magic lies upon this forest.

612
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,750
这条小溪的水充满了魔法
The waters of this stream are enchanted.

613
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,840
我看着也没那么玄乎
Doesn't look very enchanting to me.

614
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,830
我们得另外找条路过去
We must find another way across.

615
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,270
这些藤条看来挺结实的
These vines look strong enough.

616
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,190
基利!
Kili!

617
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,310
我们先派最轻的试试
We send the lightest first.

618
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,590
没事
It's all right.

619
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,200
我觉得没问题
Can't see any problem.

620
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,710
一点小问题
There's one.

621
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:06,550
我...
Everything's...

622
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,390
没事
fine.

623
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,680
事情不太对劲
Something is not right.

624
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,480
全都不对劲
This is not right at all.

625
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,990
待在那里别动! 好吧
Stay where you are! Oh.

626
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,600
我够不着
I can't get a grip.

627
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,790
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

628
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,790
你不该那么做的
You shouldn't have done that.

629
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,710
会招来厄运
It's bad luck.

630
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,350
我不相信运气
I don't believe in luck.

631
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,680
好运气得靠自己创造
We make our own luck.

632
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,830
我们得休息一下
We need to take a rest.

633
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,710
那是什么?
What is that?

634
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:51,070
那些声音
Those voices.

635
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,910
你们能听到吗?
Can you hear them?

636
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,840
我什么都没听到
I hear nothing.

637
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,990
没有风声...
No wind...

638
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,430
没有鸟鸣
no birds.

639
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,870
现在是什么时候了?
What hour is it?

640
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,790
不知道
I do not know.

641
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,070
我连今天是哪天...
I do not even...

642
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,590
都不知道
know what day it is.

643
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,390
花的时间太久了
This is taking too long.

644
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,390
这该死的森林简直...
Is there no end to this...

645
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,070
走不到头
accursed forest?

646
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,590
我是没看到头
None that I can see.

647
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,470
只有越来越多的树
Only trees and more trees.

648
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,560
走这边
This way.

649
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,750
- 甘道夫说...  - 照我说的做 跟上
- Gandalf said...  - Do as I say. Follow me.

650
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,310
蜘蛛
Attercop.

651
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,710
不 不 等等
No, no, wait.

652
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:17,150
等等
Wait.

653
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,550
停下
Stop.

654
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:22,790
我们不能离开...
We can't leave the pa...

655
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,430
我们得沿着大路走
We must stay on the path.

656
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,430
我不记得这块地方了
I don't remember this place.

657
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,310
一点都不像是走过的
None of it's familiar.

658
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,310
应该就在这里啊
It's got to be here.

659
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,920
路不可能凭空消失
It can't have just disappeared.

660
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,550
除非有人把它挪走了
Unless someone's moved it.

661
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:58,150
这里也没找到
It's not over here neither.

662
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,070
瞧
Look.

663
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,920
一个烟袋
A tobacco pouch.

664
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,590
这林子里还有别的矮人
There's Dwarves in these woods.

665
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:34,480
而且是蓝山来的矮人
Dwarves from the Blue Mountains, no less.

666
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,360
这和我的烟袋一模一样
This is exactly the same as mine.

667
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,280
因为那就是你的 明白吗?
Because it is yours. Do you understand?

668
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,350
我们在兜圈子 我们迷路了
We're going around in circles. We are lost.

669
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,630
我们没迷路 我们一直在朝东走
We are not lost. We keep heading east.

670
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:46,520
可哪里是东边? 我们看不到太阳
But which way is east? We've lost the sun.

671
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,230
你不是最有方向感了吗
I thought you were the expert.

672
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,270
太阳
The sun.

673
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,750
我们得找到...
We have to find...

674
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,270
太阳
the sun.

675
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,270
上面
Up there.

676
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,510
我们得...
We need to...

677
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,110
爬到树冠上
get above the canopy.

678
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,030
那是什么声音?
What was that?

679
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:10,120
够了! 安静! 统统闭嘴
Enough! Quiet! All of you!

680
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,830
我们被盯上了
We're being watched.

681
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,990
我能看见一个湖!
I can see a lake!

682
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,990
还有河流
And a river.

683
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,360
还有孤山
And the Lonely Mountain.

684
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,590
我们就快到了!
We're almost there!

685
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,840
听见了吗?
Can you hear me?

686
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:19,270
我知道该往哪走了!
I know which way to go!

687
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,710
嘿?
Hello?

688
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,270
听到吗
Hello.

689
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,350
不
Oh, no.

690
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,550
别啊
Oh, come on.

691
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:30,240
杀了他们! 杀了他们
Kill them! Kill them.

692
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:32,510
趁他们还活着 赶紧吃掉
Eat them now, while their blood is running.

693
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:36,270
他们的皮真硬 不过里头一定鲜美多汁
Their hide is tough, but there's good juice inside.

694
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,150
再扎一下
Stick it again.

695
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,430
再扎一下 快点搞定
Stick it again. Finish it off.

696
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,310
这食物还活着 还会乱踢!
The meat's alive and kicking!

697
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,150
杀了他
Kill him.

698
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,150
快杀了他
Kill him now.

699
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:45,990
我们要好好享用
Let us feast.

700
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,470
美食... 美食!
Feast... feast!

701
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,790
美食! 美食!
Feast! feast!

702
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,590
把他们生吞了!
Eat them alive!

703
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,870
大吃一顿!
Feast!

704
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,110
- 那是什么?  - 那是什么?
- What is it?  - What is it?

705
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,190
生吞了他们!
Eat them alive!

706
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,550
肥美多汁!
Fat and juicy!

707
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:18,350
就尝一口!
Just a little taste!

708
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:31,390
该死的! 在哪儿? 在哪儿!
Curse it! Where is it? Where is it?!

709
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,870
这儿!
Here!

710
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:37,990
好痛... 嘶! 叮了一口好痛!
It stings... Stings!

711
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:45,160
刺叮
Sting.

712
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,390
这名字不错
That's a good name.

713
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,310
刺叮
Sting.

714
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,430
你还好吗 波弗?
You all right there, Bofur?

715
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,070
- 我没事!  - 把它从我身上拿掉!
- I'm all right!  - Get it off me!

716
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,350
比尔博在哪?
Where is Bilbo?

717
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:14,590
我在这儿!
I'm up here!

718
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:47,910
抓住那些腿!
Grab the legs!

719
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:49,750
拉!
Pull!

720
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:52,710
使劲拉!
Pull!

721
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:58,070
在哪里? 在哪里? 快点
Where is it? Where's it? Come on.

722
00:43:58,790 --> 00:43:59,950
去哪儿了?
Where is it?

723
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:23,110
不!
No!

724
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:24,790
不! 不!
No! No!

725
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,990
梭林! 来搭把手!
Thorin! Get them!

726
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,230
快!
Come on!

727
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,430
小心 弟弟!
Look out, brother!

728
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:37,190
基利!
Kili!

729
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:01,960
我的
Mine.

730
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:39,350
快点 跟上!
Come on, keep up!

731
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:41,230
没有危险了!
We are clear!

732
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:04,550
别以为我不会干掉你 矮人
Do not think I won't kill you, Dwarf.

733
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:06,470
我乐意奉陪
It would be my pleasure.

734
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:12,760
- 救命!  - 基利!
- Help!  - Kili!

735
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:31,950
给我把匕首!
Throw me a dagger!

736
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:33,870
快!
Quick!

737
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:36,510
你要是以为我会给你武器 矮人...
If you think I'm giving you a weapon, Dwarf...

738
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:37,970
那就大错特错了!
you're mistaken!

739
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:45,350
搜身!
Search them!

740
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:52,950
嘿 拿回来! 这是私人物品!
Hey, give it back! That's private!

741
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:54,390
这是谁?
Who's this?

742
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,150
- 你兄弟?  - 那是...
- Your brother?  - That is...

743
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:57,670
我老婆!
my wife!

744
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:00,030
这可怕的东西又是什么?
And what is this horrid creature?

745
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:01,430
变种哥布林?
A Goblin-mutant?

746
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:03,590
那是我儿子 吉姆利!
That's my wee lad, Gimli!

747
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:36,910
你从哪里得到的?
Where did you get this?

748
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:38,470
别人赠送给我的
It was given to me.

749
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:45,310
不仅是个小偷 还是个骗子
Not just a thief, but a liar as well.

750
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:51,590
梭林 比尔博呢?
Thorin, Where is Bilbo?

751
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:57,310
这事儿没完!
This is not the end of it!

752
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:00,830
- 听到没有?!  - 嘿 放我们出去!
- Do you hear me?!  - Hey, let us out of here!

753
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:02,630
放开我!
Get off me!

754
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:11,030
你不打算搜我的身吗?
Aren't you going to search me?

755
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:14,870
我裤裆底下可能还有东西
I could have anything down my trousers.

756
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:17,270
也可能什么也没有
Or, nothing.

757
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:54,030
- 啊... 再来!  - 别撞了!
- Arhhg... again!  - Leave it!

758
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:56,120
出不去的!
There is no way out!

759
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:58,350
这不是奥克建的地牢
This is no Orc dungeon.

760
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:01,110
这是林地王国的宫殿
These are the Halls of the Woodland Realm.

761
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:05,190
没有国王的同意 谁也别想出去
No one leaves here, but, by the King's consent.

762
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:13,430
一些人以为 这将是一场神圣的征程
Some may imagine that a noble quest is at hand.

763
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:18,910
屠杀恶龙 夺回家园
A quest to reclaim a homeland and slay a dragon.

764
00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:24.140
我却怀疑 真正的动机并不那么高尚
I myself, suspect a more prosaic motive.

765
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,840
盗窃财宝...
Attempted burglary...

766
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:29,870
或是什么别的企图
or something of that ilk.

767
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,030
你找到了密道
You have found a way in.

768
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:36,390
你妄图找回那颗...
You seek that which would...

769
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:39,470
赋予你统治权的珠宝
bestow upon you the right to rule.

770
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:42,030
国王宝石
A King's Jewel.

771
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:44,440
阿肯宝石
The Arkenstone.

772
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:50,030
对你而言 它的价值无可估量
It is precious to you beyond measure.

773
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:52,750
这我明白
I understand that.

774
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:57,350
孤山里也有我想要的珠宝
There are gems in the mountain that I too desire.

775
00:50:58,670 --> 00:50:59,670
白宝石...
White gems...

776
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:01,950
如星光般纯粹
of pure starlight.

777
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:05,270
我会向你提供帮助
I offer you my help.

778
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:09,830
我听着呢
I am listening.

779
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:11,710
我放你离开...
I will let you go...

780
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:15,390
条件是将我的东西归还于我
If you but return what is mine.

781
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:19,920
礼尚往来
A favour, for a favour.

782
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:21,230
我向你保证
You have my word.

783
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:25,030
以国王的名义
One King to another.

784
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:32,430
我不相信你 瑟兰杜伊
I would not trust, Thranduil.

785
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:34,470
伟大的王...
The great king...

786
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:35,830
会信守诺言...
to honor his word...

787
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:38,590
哪怕末日降临!
should the end of all days be upon us!

788
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,330
你!
You!

789
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,510
毫无信用!
lack all honor!

790
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:45,630
我亲眼目睹你背叛盟友
I have seen how you treat your friends.

791
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:49,950
曾经我们忍饥挨饿 流离失所...
We came to you once, starving, homeless...

792
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,630
寻求你的帮助
seeking your help.

793
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:54,550
可你却转头离开!
But you turned your back!

794
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:58,470
是你 弃我族人的苦痛于不顾...
You, turned away from the suffering of my people...

795
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,710
任他们被毁灭吞噬!
and the infernal that destroyed us!

796
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:05,390
不要和我提及龙焰
Do not talk to me of dragonfire.

797
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:08,950
我知晓它毁灭的力量
I know it's wrath and ruin.

798
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:14,310
我曾面对过...
I have faced...

799
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:17,350
北方的巨龙
the great serpents of the North.

800
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:23,710
我警告过你祖父 他的贪婪将会带来什么后果
I warned your grandfather of what his greed would summon.

801
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:27,190
但他不肯听从
But he would not listen.

802
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,790
你和他一模一样
You are just like him.

803
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:39,840
你若愿意 就待在这儿直到腐烂吧
Stay here if you will and rot.

804
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:41,990
对于精灵来说 一百年...
A hundred years is a mere blink...

805
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:44,230
也不过一瞬
in the life of an Elf.

806
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:46,150
我很有耐心
I am patient.

807
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:49,190
我可以等
I can wait.

808
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:57,750
他和你提条件了吗?
Did he offer you a deal?

809
00:52:57,990 --> 00:52:59,150
提了
He did.

810
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:01,990
我让他等着我
I told him he could go

811
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:06,590
唾弃他和他的族人!
Him and all his kin!

812
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:09,590
好吧 只能这样了
Well, that's that, then.

813
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:13,790
交易... 是我们唯一的希望
A deal... was our only hope.

814
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:18,990
不是唯一的
Not our only hope.

815
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:27,280
我知道你在那儿
I know you're there.

816
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:32,070
为何在阴影中徘徊?
Why do you linger in the shadows?

817
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:35,470
我正要来向你汇报
I was coming to report to you.

818
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,990
我以为距离上次命令清除蜘蛛巢穴 不过两个月
I thought I ordered that nest to be destroyed not two moons past.

819
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:42,510
我们已奉命清理了森林 陛下
We cleared the forest as ordered, my lord.

820
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:43,780
但蜘蛛源源不断地...
But more spiders keep...

821
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:44,990
从南方涌来
coming up from the South.

822
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:46,070
它们正在...
They are spawning in...

823
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:47,320
多古尔都的遗迹内繁殖
the ruins of Dol Guldur.

824
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,650
如果我们能从源头消灭...
If we could kill them at their source...

825
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,790
那座堡垒在我们的边界以外
That fortress lies beyond our borders.

826
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:53,830
保护国土免受邪恶生物的侵扰 这才是你的任务
Keep our lands clear of those foul creatures. That's your task.

827
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:56,710
即便将它们赶走 又怎么样呢?
And when we drive them off, what then?

828
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:58,560
它们就不会侵入其它地方吗?
Will they not spread to other lands?

829
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:00,670
其它地方不由我操心
Other lands are not my concern.

830
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:05,070
中土世界的命运朝起夕落
The fortunes of the world will rise and fall.

831
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:07,070
但这方国土内,
But here in this kingdom,

832
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:08,180
我们能持久生存
we will endure.

833
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:14,510
莱戈拉斯说你今天打得很棒
Legolas said you fought well today.

834
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:21,550
他对你很有好感
He has grown very fond of you.

835
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,230
陛下 我向您保证...
I assure you, my lord...

836
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:29,440
莱戈拉斯只当我是卫队的队长
Legolas thinks of me as no more than a captain of the guard.

837
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:31,510
或许曾经是的
Perhaps he did once.

838
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:35,070
现在 我不那么肯定了
Now, I am not so sure.

839
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:40,950
我想您不会允许自己儿子...
I do not think you would allow your son...

840
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:43,630
委身于一个卑微的西尔凡精灵吧
to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan Elf.

841
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:46,480
没错 我不会允许
No, you are right. I would not.

842
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:49,510
但他依然很关心你
Still, he cares about you.

843
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:52,870
如果没有希望 就不要对他纵容
Do not give him hope where there is none.

844
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:34,310
你手里的石头 那是什么?
The stone in your hand, what is it?

845
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,270
是一块符文石
It is a talisman.

846
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:43,110
上面附有强大的咒语
A powerful spell lies upon it.

847
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:46,070
除了矮人 任何人只要读了上面的如尼文
If any but a dwarf reads the runes on the stone,

848
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:48,150
就会被永远诅咒
they will be forever cursed.

849
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:55,510
也可能不会
Or not.

850
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:00,110
取决于你信不信这种东西 不过是块石头罢了
Depending on whether you believe in that kind of thing. It's just a token.

851
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,310
如尼符石
A rune stone.

852
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:09,230
是我妈妈给我的 让我记住自己的承诺
My mother gave me it to me so I'd remember my promise.

853
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,350
什么承诺?
What promise?

854
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,230
我会回到她身边
That I would come back to her.

855
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:18,390
她很担心我
She worries.

856
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:21,400
她觉得我冒冒失失的
She thinks I'm reckless.

857
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:23,230
是吗?
Are you?

858
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:26,070
才没有
Nah.

859
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:40,390
上面听起来... 似乎是场挺大的聚会
Sounds like quite a party, you're having up there.

860
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:43,070
那是"梅瑞斯-吉里斯"
It is Mereth-en-Gilith.

861
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:45,510
星光盛宴
The Feast of Starlight.

862
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:49,150
对埃尔达精灵而言 任何光芒都奉为神圣
All light is sacred to the Eldar.

863
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:53,190
但木精灵最喜爱的是璀璨星光
But the Wood-elves loves best the light of the stars.

864
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:55,360
我一直以为它是冰冷的
I always thought it is a cold light.

865
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:59,750
遥不可及
Remote and far away.

866
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:02,830
那是记忆...
It is memory...

867
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:05,750
珍贵 纯净
precious and pure.

868
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:11,760
如同你的承诺
Like your promise.

869
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:23,070
我曾漫步于星光之下
I have walked there sometimes.

870
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,750
越过森林 徜徉于夜空
Beyond the forest and up into the night.

871
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:31,350
我看到世界逐渐消隐...
I have seen the world fall away...

872
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:35,400
而纯白的光芒 渗透每一丝气息
And the white light forever filled the air.

873
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:40,670
我曾见过一轮火月
I saw a fire moon once.

874
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:45,240
巨大的月亮从登兰德的小道边升起
It rose over the pass near Dunland. Huge.

875
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:48,070
金红的月光洒满天空
Red and gold, it was. It filled the sky.

876
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:52,880
我们当时正护送一队路因山脉的商人 他们...
We were in escort with some merchants in Ered Luin. They were...

877
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:56,270
用银器交易皮毛 我们由绿大道向南
trading in silver work for furs. We took the Greenway south,

878
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:58,790
迷雾山脉在左侧绵延
keeping the mountain to our left.

879
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:00,760
紧接着 它出现了
And then it appeared.

880
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:03,030
一轮巨大的火月...
This huge fire moon...

881
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:05,120
照亮了道路
lighting our path.

882
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:07,630
我真希望能让你看看
I wish I could show you the caverns.

883
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:11,550
加立安 你这老混账! 我们酒快喝完了
Galion, you old rogue! We're running out of drink.

884
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:15,190
那些空木桶几小时前就该送去埃斯加洛斯
These empty barrels should have been sent to Esgaroth hours ago.

885
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:17,470
那个船夫正等着呢
The bargeman will be waiting for them.

886
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:18,950
随你怎么抱怨我们国王...
Say what you like about our...

887
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:22,390
脾气不好 他对酒的品味实在是高
ill-tempered king. He has excellent taste in wine.

888
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:24,910
来 埃尔洛斯 尝尝
Come, Elros, try it.

889
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:27,710
我还得监管矮人
I have the dwarves in my charge.

890
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:31,030
他们被锁着 能上哪儿去? 哈哈
They're locked up, where can they go? Ha, ha.

891
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:36,680
我敢打赌太阳升起来了
I'll wager the sun is on the rise.

892
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:38,630
肯定快到黎明了
Must be nearly dawn.

893
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:41,190
我们永远到不了孤山了 对吗?
We never gonna reach the mountain, are we?

894
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:46,230
能逃出去就不会了
Not stuck in here, you're not.

895
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:52,830
比尔博!
Bilbo!

896
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:54,070
什么?
What?

897
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:58,440
嘘! 附近有守卫!
Shh! There are guards nearby!

898
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:05,110
- 哈 哈 哈  - 把门关上
- Ha, ha, ha.  - Close the doors.

899
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:07,550
- 能为我们多争取些时间  - 好的 诺瑞
- It'll buy us more time.  - All right, Nori.

900
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:19,950
- 上楼梯  - 你先走
- Up the stairs.  - You first.

901
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:20,670
欧瑞
Ori.

902
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:22,550
不是那条路 往下走 跟着我!
Not that way. Down here. Follow me!

903
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:24,750
走
Go.

904
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:26,350
慢点
Easy, now.

905
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:42,510
这边走
This way.

906
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:46,390
快啊
Come on.

907
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:48,310
简直不敢相信 我们在酒窖里!
I don't believe it. We're in the cellars!

908
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:50,230
你应该带我们逃出去 而不是越走越深!
You were supposed to be leading us out, not further in!

909
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:51,190
我知道自己在干什么!
I know what I'm doing!

910
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:52,470
嘘!
Shh!

911
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:54,430
这边! 这边!
This way! This way!

912
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:02,550
- 大家快爬进木桶里  - 你疯了?
- Everyone climb into the barrels quickly.  - Are you mad?

913
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:04,430
- 他们会找到我们的  - 不 不
- They'll find us.  - No, no.

914
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:05,710
不会的 我保证
They won't, I promise you.

915
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:09,470
拜托 拜托了... 你们必须相信我
Please, please... You must trust me.

916
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:14,430
照他说的做
Do as he says.

917
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:16,870
动动你的大脑袋
Move your big ginger head.

918
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,750
比弗 进桶里去 快点!
Bifur, get in the barrel! Move!

919
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:30,120
大家都进去了
Everyone's in.

920
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:35,150
现在怎么办?
What do we do now?

921
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:36,910
别呼吸
Hold your breath.

922
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:38,710
别呼吸? 你什么意思?
Hold my breath? What do you mean?

923
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:06,350
管地牢钥匙的人在哪儿?
Where is the Keeper of the Keys?

924
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:34,710
干得好 巴金斯老爷
Well done, Master Baggins.

925
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:37,430
我们走! 快点!
Go! Come on, let's go!

926
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:49,080
抓牢了!
Hold on!

927
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:03,640
比尔博!
Bilbo!

928
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:09,470
坚持住
Hang on!

929
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:13,390
- 救命!  - 欧瑞!
- Help!  - Ori!

930
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:39,110
不!
No!

931
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:54,230
小心! 奥克来了!
Watch out! There's Orcs!

932
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:15,230
躲到桥下去!
Get under the bridge!

933
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:28,870
基利!
Kili!

934
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:54,790
基利!
Kili!

935
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:02,550
基利
Kili.

936
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:57,230
基利!
Kili!

937
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:22,270
诺瑞!
Nori!

938
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:36,150
砍断树干!
Cut the log!

939
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:45,230
邦伯!
Bombur!

940
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:21,710
陶瑞尔!
Tauriel.

941
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:20,590
哦 是你啊!
Oh, it's you!

942
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:22,440
干嘛叫我来这里 甘道夫?
Why am I here, Gandalf?

943
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:23,870
相信我 拉达加斯特
Trust me, Radagast.

944
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:27,080
我不会平白无故叫你到这里来
I would not have called you here without good reason.

945
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:34,200
这可不是见面的好地方
This is not a nice place to meet.

946
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:35,550
没错
No.

947
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:38,000
的确不好
It is not.

948
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:41,590
这些是黑暗咒语 甘道夫
These are dark spells, Gandalf.

949
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:44,550
很古老 而且充满仇恨
Old and full of hate.

950
01:10:44,830 --> 01:10:46,160
这里埋的是谁?
Who's buried here?

951
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:49,870
如果他有名字 那也早被忘记了
If he had a name, it's long since been lost.

952
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:52,190
人们只知道他是...
He would have been known only...

953
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:54,750
侍奉邪恶的奴仆
as a servant of evil.

954
01:10:57,230 --> 01:10:59,270
数人之一
One of a number.

955
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:05,350
九戒灵之一
One of nine.

956
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:10,510
为什么是现在 甘道夫? 我不明白
Why now, Gandalf? I don't understand.

957
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:13,390
戒灵已被召唤去多古尔都
The Ringwraiths have been summoned to Dol Guldur.

958
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:15,590
但召唤他们的不可能是死灵法师
But, it cannot be the Necromancer.

959
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:19,350
人类法师无法召唤这种恶灵
A human sorcerer could not summon such evil.

960
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:21,550
谁说那是个人类?
Who said it was human?

961
01:11:23,310 --> 01:11:26,870
九戒只听从一人的差遣
The Nine only answer to one master.

962
01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:29,710
我们都被蒙蔽了 拉达加斯特
We've been blind, Radagast.

963
01:11:29,950 --> 01:11:32,030
在我们疏忽大意时...
And in our blindness...

964
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:34,390
大敌已当前
the Enemy has returned.

965
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:39,030
他在召唤自己的仆人
He is summoning his servants.

966
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:41,430
"亵渎者"阿佐格...
Azog the Defiler...

967
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:43,670
并非普通猎杀者
is no ordinary hunter.

968
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:45,240
他是个指挥官
He is a commander.

969
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:48,030
多支军队的指挥官
A commander of legions.

970
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:52,480
我们的大敌正在备战
The Enemy is preparing for war.

971
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:54,840
战争会从东边开始
It will begin in the East.

972
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:57,880
他定会攻下那座山
His mind is set upon that mountain.

973
01:11:58,150 --> 01:11:59,990
- 你要去哪儿?  - 和其他人会合
- Where are you going?  - To rejoin the others.

974
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:01,230
甘道夫
Gandalf.

975
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:05,110
一切因我而起 我不能丢下他们
I started this. I cannot forsake them.

976
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:07,270
他们现在命在旦夕
They are in grave danger.

977
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:08,790
如果你所言不虚...
If what you say is true...

978
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:11,760
世界正面临巨大的危机
the world is in grave danger.

979
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:16,430
那座堡垒/要塞里的力量只会变得越来越强（TBD）
The power in that fortress will only grow stronger.

980
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:20,870
你要我丢下自己的朋友?
You want me to cast my friends aside?

981
01:12:23,870 --> 01:12:26,190
- 有东西跟着吗?  - 我没看到
- Anything behind us?  - Not that I can see.

982
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:33,000
我想我们甩掉奥克了
I think we've outrun the Orcs.

983
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,670
他们很快会追上来 水流变缓了
Not for long. We've lost the current.

984
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:36,630
邦伯快淹死了
Bombur's half drowned.

985
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:38,950
- 上岸去!  - 好
- Make for the shore!  - Aye.

986
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:40,230
快点 我们走
Come on, let's go!

987
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:42,190
格罗因 好兄弟 帮我下
Gloin, help me, my brother.

988
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:46,390
快点 站起来
Come on, lift yourself.

989
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:47,990
加油!
Come on!

990
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:50,670
加油 你这大块头!
Come on, you big lump, you!

991
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:02,510
我没事 没关系
I'm fine. It's nothing.

992
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:03,750
站起来
On your feet.

993
01:13:03,910 --> 01:13:05,950
基利受伤了 他的腿需要包扎
Kili's wounded. His leg needs binding.

994
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:08,590
一群奥克在追我们呢 不能停
There's an Orc pack at our tail. We keep moving.

995
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:09,830
去哪儿? 
To where?

996
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:11,910
去孤山 我们都快到了
To the mountain. We're so close.

997
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:15,400
中间还隔着一个湖呢
A lake lies between us and that mountain.

998
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:17,910
- 我们没法过去  - 那我们就绕过去
- We have no way to cross it.  - So then, we go arround.

999
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:21,160
奥克会很快就会追上来 时间也不够
The Orcs will run us down, as sure as daylight.

1000
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:23,470
我们没有武器 不能自保
We have no weapons to defend ourselves.

1001
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:25,390
快点帮他包扎好
Bind his leg, quickly.

1002
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:27,480
给你们两分钟
You have two minutes.

1003
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:48,790
敢再来一次...
Do it again...

1004
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:50,590
你们的小命就没了
and you're dead.

1005
01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:54,510
不好意思...
Excuse me...

1006
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:57,870
没搞错的话 你是长湖镇来的吗?
but you're from Lake-town, if I'm not mistaken.

1007
01:13:58,830 --> 01:14:01,350
那边那艘驳船...
That barge over there...

1008
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:04,870
我们可不可以租下来?
it wouldn't be available for hire, by any chance?

1009
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:08,630
你们为什么觉得我会帮你们?
What makes you think I would help you?

1010
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:10,710
你的靴子很旧了
Those boots have seen better days.

1011
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:12,880
大衣也很寒碜
As has that coat.

1012
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,910
你家里应该有好几张嘴要喂吧
No doubts you have some hungry mouths to feed.

1013
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:18,440
有几个人?
How many bairns?

1014
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:21,000
一个男孩 两个女孩
A boy and two girls.

1015
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:24,560
还有你夫人 想必是个美人吧?
And your wife, I imagine she's a beauty?

1016
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:26,910
没错
Aye.

1017
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:28,430
生前是
She was.

1018
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:33,160
对不起 我不是有意...
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

1019
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:35,270
哦 得了 别再装好人了
Oh, come on, come on. Enough of the niceties.

1020
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:38,070
你们着急什么?
What's your hurry?

1021
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:39,550
问这个干嘛?
What's it to you?

1022
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:41,470
我想知道你们是谁...
I would like to know who you are...

1023
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:44,350
跑到这里来干什么
and what you are doing in these lands.

1024
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:46,990
我们不过是商人 来自蓝山
We are simple merchants from the Blue Mountains.

1025
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:48,790
要去铁丘陵探望...
Journeying to see our kin...

1026
01:14:49,070 --> 01:14:50,640
几个亲戚
in the Iron Hills.

1027
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:53,990
你说你们只是商人?
Simple merchants, you say?

1028
01:14:54,230 --> 01:14:55,560
我们需要食物...
We need food...

1029
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:57,790
供给 还有武器
supplies, weapons.

1030
01:14:58,030 --> 01:14:59,190
你能帮我们吗?
Can you help us?

1031
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:05,990
我知道这些酒桶的来历
I know where these barrels came from.

1032
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:07,990
怎么了?
What of it?

1033
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:10,670
我不知道你们和精灵做了什么生意...
I don't know what business you had with the Elves...

1034
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:12,910
不过看来结果不太好
but I don't think it ended well.

1035
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:17,470
只有镇长才能带人进镇子
No one enters Lake-town but by lead of the Master.

1036
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:20,870
和林地王国做生意 是他唯一的财源
All his wealth comes from trade with the Woodland realm.

1037
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:23,910
为了不让瑟兰杜伊生气 他会把你们关进监狱 
He would see you in irons before risking the wrath of King Thranduil.

1038
01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:26,830
多给他点好处
Offer him more.

1039
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:32,550
我打赌肯定有偷偷进镇子的方法
I'll wager there are ways to enter that town unseen.

1040
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:34,510
是啊
Aye.

1041
01:15:35,870 --> 01:15:37,110
但那样的话...
But for that...

1042
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:39,720
你得找个蛇头
you would need a smuggler.

1043
01:15:39,950 --> 01:15:41,870
我们会付钱的 双倍
For which we would pay double.

1044
01:15:50,430 --> 01:15:53,530
邪恶本就如此
Such is the nature of evil.

1045
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:55,870
在大地上 众生的无知...
Out there in the vast ignorance of the world...

1046
01:15:56,110 --> 01:15:58,430
正愈演愈烈 跋扈横行
it festers and spreads.

1047
01:15:58,670 --> 01:16:01,400
这是黑暗中孕育的不详
A shadow that grows in the dark.

1048
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:03,710
这股不眠不休的邪恶力量...
A sleepless malice as black...

1049
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:06,870
比即将到来的夜晚更黑暗
as the oncoming wall of night.

1050
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:09,760
过去如此
So it ever was.

1051
01:16:10,510 --> 01:16:12,550
未来亦是如此
So will it always be.

1052
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:17,510
届时 所有的秽物都将现身
In time, all foul things come forth.

1053
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:20,720
你们在追踪十三个矮人
You were tracking a company of 13 Dwarves.

1054
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:21,950
为什么?
Why?

1055
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:25,270
现在没有十三个了
Not 13. Not anymore.

1056
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:26,990
那个年轻的...
The young one...

1057
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:29,510
黑头发弓箭手...
the black-haired archer...

1058
01:16:29,950 --> 01:16:31,950
我们用魔古尔箭射中了他
we stuck him with a Morgul shaft.

1059
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:36,750
毒素已进入他的血液 很快...
The poison's in his blood. He'll be...

1060
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:38,030
他就要小命不保了
choking on it soon.

1061
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:40,630
问什么答什么 下贱东西!
Answer the question, filth.

1062
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:47,750
千万别惹她
I would not antagonize her.

1063
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:50,150
你喜欢杀戮 奥克?
You like killing things, Orc?

1064
01:16:51,470 --> 01:16:52,830
喜欢有人丧命?
You like death?

1065
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:55,270
那就让我先送你上路!
Then let me give it to you.

1066
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:12,750
我不在乎...
I do not care about one...

1067
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:15,630
一个矮人的死活 回答问题
dead Dwarf. Answer the question.

1068
01:17:16,150 --> 01:17:18,790
你没什么好怕的
You have nothing to fear.

1069
01:17:18,820 --> 01:17:21,950
把知道的告诉我们 我就还你自由
Tell us what you know and I will set you free.

1070
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:24,910
有人命令你杀了他们 为什么?
You had orders to kill them. Why?

1071
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:27,350
梭林・橡木盾跟你什么关系?
What is Thorin Oakenshield to you?

1072
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:30,480
那个矮人畜生永远当不了国王
The Dwarf runt will never be king.

1073
01:17:30,710 --> 01:17:31,710
国王?
King?

1074
01:17:31,870 --> 01:17:34,950
如今没有山下之王 以后也不会有
There is no king under the mountain, nor will there ever be.

1075
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:38,790
只要龙还活着 没人敢进埃瑞博
None would dare enter Erebor whilst the dragon lives.

1076
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:40,640
你什么都不知道
You know nothing.

1077
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:43,510
你的世界要完蛋了
Your world will burn.

1078
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:45,390
什么意思?
What are you talking about?

1079
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:47,110
说!
Speak!

1080
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:50,360
我们的时代又要到了
Our time has come again.

1081
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:54,270
我的主人 侍奉的是至尊者
My master serves the One.

1082
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:58,190
这样说你明白了吗 精灵?
Do you understand now, Elfling?

1083
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:00,310
你们的死期将至
Death is upon you.

1084
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:02,750
战火...
The flames of war...

1085
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:04,640
就要降临!
are upon you!

1086
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:08,750
为什么这样做?
Why did you do that?

1087
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:11,110
你保证过要还他自由
You promised to set him free.

1088
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:12,470
我没有食言
And I did.

1089
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:16,750
他可怜的脑袋自由了 离开了可憎的肩膀
I freed his wretched head from his miserable shoulders.

1090
01:18:18,350 --> 01:18:20,950
他本来还能多告诉我们些事情
There was more the Orc could tell us.

1091
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:23,630
他能招的都招了
There was nothing more he could tell me.

1092
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:27,070
他说的"战火"是什么意思?
What did he mean by "the flames of war"?

1093
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:30,030
意思就是 他们打算启用一件强力的武器...
It means they intend to unleash a weapon so great...

1094
01:18:30,270 --> 01:18:32,430
杀掉所有阻挡之人
it will destroy all before it.

1095
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:36,510
边境 所有道路 还有河道的守卫都要加倍
I want the watch doubled at our borders, all roads, all rivers.

1096
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:38,510
没有我的命令不准擅动
Nothing moves, but I hear of it.

1097
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:40,270
这个王国 没人能进来
No one enters this kingdom.

1098
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:42,950
也没人能出去
And no one leaves it.

1099
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:09,430
小心!
Watch out!

1100
01:20:18,190 --> 01:20:20,720
你打算干嘛 淹死我们?
What are you trying to do, drown us?

1101
01:20:20,990 --> 01:20:23,560
我就是在这片水域长大的 矮人老爷
I was born and bred on these waters, Master Dwarf.

1102
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:25,200
就算我想把你们淹死...
If I wanted to drown you...

1103
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:27,030
也不会在这儿动手
I would not do it here.

1104
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:31,510
我受够了这个嘴碎的船夫了
Oh, I've had enough of this lippy Lakeman.

1105
01:20:31,790 --> 01:20:34,520
要我说 就把他从这里丢下去 摆脱他得了
I say we throw him over the side and be done with it.

1106
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:37,230
- 巴德 他名字叫巴德  - 你怎么知道?
- Bard, his name's Bard.  - How do you know?

1107
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:39,240
我问过他
Uh, I asked him.

1108
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:42,080
我不管他叫什么 我不喜欢他
I don't care what he calls himself. I don't like him.

1109
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:43,880
我们不用喜欢他
We do not have to like him.

1110
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:45,760
我们付他钱就好了
We simply have to pay him.

1111
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:49,030
好了 兄弟们 把钱都交出来
Come on now, lads. Turn out your pockets.

1112
01:20:50,270 --> 01:20:51,840
我们怎么知道他不会背叛我们?
How do we know he won't betray us?

1113
01:20:52,070 --> 01:20:53,310
我们不知道
We don't.

1114
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:56,390
这儿有点小麻烦
There's just a wee problem.

1115
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:59,030
我们还差十个银币
We're 10 coins short.

1116
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,190
格罗因
Gloin.

1117
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:04,070
别藏了
Come on.

1118
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:06,430
- 把你的都拿出来  - 看我干嘛
- Give us what you have.  - Don't look to me.

1119
01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:09,870
这趟冒险就快要...
I have been bled dry...

1120
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:11,190
把我榨干了
by this venture.

1121
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:14,030
我投资的回报呢?
What have I seen for my investment?

1122
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,630
除了痛苦和不幸...
Naught but misery and...

1123
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:17,870
什么也没...
grief and...

1124
01:21:26,110 --> 01:21:28,070
老天啊
Bless my beard.

1125
01:21:28,910 --> 01:21:30,070
拿去
Take it.

1126
01:21:31,190 --> 01:21:32,600
- 全拿去  - 嗯哼
- Take all of it.  - Ahem.

1127
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:37,710
钱呢 快拿来 快给我
The money, quick. Give it to me.

1128
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:40,470
拿到东西了我们再付钱 之前免谈
We will pay you when we get our provisions but not before.

1129
01:21:40,710 --> 01:21:43,190
如果你还想要自由 就照我说的办
If you value your freedom, you'll do as I say.

1130
01:21:43,630 --> 01:21:44,910
前面有守卫
There are guards ahead.

1131
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:04,830
他在干嘛?
What's he doing?

1132
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:06,390
他在跟人说话
He's talking to someone.

1133
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:10,110
他... 正指着我们
He is... pointing right at us.

1134
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:14,910
他们在握手了
Now they're shaking hands.

1135
01:22:15,190 --> 01:22:16,630
- 什么?  - 这个混账
- What?  - The villain.

1136
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:18,200
他在出卖我们
He's selling us out.

1137
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:40,590
老天啊!
Oh, good God!

1138
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:42,190
安静
Quiet.

1139
01:22:44,910 --> 01:22:46,630
我们要过检查站了
We're approaching the tollgate.

1140
01:22:57,990 --> 01:22:58,990
停船!
Halt!

1141
01:22:59,150 --> 01:23:00,480
货物检查!
Goods inspection!

1142
01:23:01,230 --> 01:23:03,070
请出示文件!
Papers, please!

1143
01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:05,070
哦 是你啊 巴德
Oh, it's you, Bard.

1144
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:06,350
早上好 珀西
Morning, Percy.

1145
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:07,790
有什么要报关的吗?
Anything to declare?

1146
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:10,800
没有 但我又累又冷...
Nothing, but that I am cold and tired...

1147
01:23:11,070 --> 01:23:12,110
只想回家
and ready for home.

1148
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:13,590
彼此彼此
You and me both.

1149
01:23:17,710 --> 01:23:19,120
行了
There we are.

1150
01:23:19,350 --> 01:23:20,350
一切都好
All in order.

1151
01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:23,270
先... 等等
Not... so... fast.

1152
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:28,250
"受委托从林地王国运来木桶"
"Consignment of empty barrels from the Woodland Realm."

1153
01:23:29,230 --> 01:23:30,230
只不过...
Only...

1154
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:33,760
现在桶是满的...
they're not empty...

1155
01:23:34,590 --> 01:23:35,790
对不对 巴德?
are they, Bard?

1156
01:23:36,030 --> 01:23:37,030
如果我记得没错...
If I recall correctly...

1157
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:39,550
根据登记 你是个船夫
you're licensed as a bargeman.

1158
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:41,510
不是...
Not...

1159
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:44,190
渔民
a fisherman.

1160
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:45,910
那跟你没关系
That's none of your business.

1161
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:47,630
你错了
Wrong.

1162
01:23:47,830 --> 01:23:51,270
跟镇长有关的事情 就跟我有关系
It's the Master's business, which makes it my business.

1163
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:54,080
哦 得了 阿尔弗雷德 发发善心 大家得吃东西
Oh, come on, Alfrid, have a heart. People need to eat.

1164
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:56,550
这些鱼是非法的
These fish are illegal.

1165
01:23:57,310 --> 01:23:59,150
把桶倒空了
Empty the barrels over the side.

1166
01:23:59,190 --> 01:24:00,790
- 大家都听见了  - 倒进湖里
- You heard him.  - In the canal.

1167
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:04,430
快点 动手吧
Come on. Get a move on.

1168
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:06,470
镇上的乡亲们正度日如年
Folk in this town are struggling.

1169
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:08,230
时世艰难
Times are hard.

1170
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:09,510
食物短缺
Food is scarce.

1171
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:10,830
那不关我的事
That's not my problem.

1172
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:13,270
要是人们听说 镇长把鱼...
And when the people hear the Master is dumping fish...

1173
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:14,960
倒回湖里呢...
back in the lake...

1174
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:17,080
要是他们起义了...
when the rioting starts...

1175
01:24:19,910 --> 01:24:21,270
那就关你的事了吧?
will it be your problem then?

1176
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:27,350
住手
Stop.

1177
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:33,250
总想做英雄是吗 巴德?
Ever the people's champion, eh, Bard?

1178
01:24:33,590 --> 01:24:35,430
总想保护老百姓
Protector of the common folk.

1179
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:37,150
他们可能现在会拥护你 但是 划船的...
You might have their favor now, bargeman...

1180
01:24:37,190 --> 01:24:38,190
好景不会太长
but it won't last.

1181
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:43,470
升起闸门!
Raise the gate!

1182
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:48,510
镇长一直盯着你呢
The Master has his eye on you.

1183
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,240
你最好记清楚了!
You'd do well to remember:

1184
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:52,030
我们知道你的住处
We know where you live.

1185
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:53,950
这是个小镇 阿尔弗雷德
It's a small town, Alfrid.

1186
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:56,710
大家都知道彼此的住处
Everyone knows where everyone lives.

1187
01:25:12,870 --> 01:25:15,190
镇上谣言满天飞
All this talk of civil unrest.

1188
01:25:15,430 --> 01:25:17,110
有人唯恐天下不乱 大人
Someone's been stirring the pot, sire.

1189
01:25:20,590 --> 01:25:21,750
痛风发作了吗 大人?
Gout playing up, sire?

1190
01:25:21,990 --> 01:25:22,990
湿气太重!
It's the damp!

1191
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:24,590
只可能是这个原因
It's the only possible explanation.

1192
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:26,030
给我一杯白兰地
Get me a brandy.

1193
01:25:26,910 --> 01:25:29,720
大人 人们的情绪越来越糟
The mood of the people, Sire, is turning ugly.

1194
01:25:29,950 --> 01:25:32,920
小老百姓而已 阿尔弗雷德 他们的情绪一直很糟
They're commoners, Alfrid. They've always been ugly.

1195
01:25:33,150 --> 01:25:34,790
他们住在这个腥臊烂臭的地方...
It's not my fault they live in a place...

1196
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:37,680
又不是我的错
that stinks of fish oil and tar.

1197
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:41,360
工作 住房 食物
Jobs, shelter, food.

1198
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:43,240
他们就这些可抱怨的
It's all they ever bleat about.

1199
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:47,110
大人 我认为他们是被闹事者鼓动了
It's my belief, sire, they are being led on by troublemakers.

1200
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:49,790
那我们得找到那些...
Then we must find these...

1201
01:25:50,070 --> 01:25:51,990
闹事者 将他们绳之以法
troublemakers and arrest them.

1202
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:54,150
我也是这么想的 大人
My thoughts exactly, sire.

1203
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:57,230
所有要求变革的言论必须终结
And all this talk of change must be suppressed.

1204
01:25:57,470 --> 01:25:59,750
不能让那群乌合之众联合起来...
Can't afford to let the rabble band together...

1205
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:01,790
引发麻烦 否则下一步...
and start making noises. The next thing...

1206
01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:04,870
他们就会开始质问我们...
you know, they'll start asking questions...

1207
01:26:05,110 --> 01:26:06,710
成立委员会...
forming committees...

1208
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:09,110
展开调查
launching inquiries.

1209
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:11,830
或是用新人取代老人?
Out with the old, in with the new?

1210
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:13,550
什么?
What?

1211
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:15,790
这是我听说的 大人
That's what they've been saying, sire.

1212
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:17,030
他们甚至在讨论...
There is even talk...

1213
01:26:17,230 --> 01:26:18,470
改选
of an election.

1214
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:19,910
改选? 哈
An election? Heh.

1215
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:21,480
荒唐可笑
That's absurd.

1216
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:23,710
我绝对不会支持 哈!
I won't stand for it. Ha!

1217
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:26,750
恐怕他们不会过问您的意见 大人
I don't think they'd ask you to stand, Sire.

1218
01:26:28,630 --> 01:26:30,200
缩头乌龟
Shirkers.

1219
01:26:30,430 --> 01:26:31,430
忘恩负义
Ingrates.

1220
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:32,630
蛊惑人心的家伙!
Rabble-rousers!

1221
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:35,600
是谁胆敢质疑我的权威?
Who would have the nerve to question my authority?

1222
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:37,510
谁敢?
Who would dare?

1223
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:38,750
谁...?
Who...?

1224
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:45,030
巴德
Bard.

1225
01:26:45,870 --> 01:26:47,440
你给我记下
You mark my words:

1226
01:26:47,710 --> 01:26:51,150
那个闹事的船夫一定是背后的主谋
That trouble-making bargeman is behind all this.

1227
01:26:51,390 --> 01:26:52,190
别人谁也不敢...
No one else would have the...

1228
01:26:52,430 --> 01:26:53,070
煎睾丸...
Bollocks...

1229
01:26:53,310 --> 01:26:54,310
大人
sire.

1230
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:58,630
取自绵羊和山羊 用美味蘑菇肉汁烹调
Ram and goat, sautéed in a lovely little mushroom gravy.

1231
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:03,230
要是在理想世界 我们早就逮捕他了
In an ideal world, sire, we'd arrest him.

1232
01:27:03,710 --> 01:27:06,680
可巴德更受民众喜爱
But Bard has the favor of the people.

1233
01:27:06,910 --> 01:27:09,430
他们视他为领袖
They see him as a leader.

1234
01:27:11,110 --> 01:27:13,350
真正值得爱戴的人
Someone they can truly admire.

1235
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:14,830
既谦逊...
Modest...

1236
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:16,630
又睿智...
intelligent...

1237
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:17,990
长得英俊...
handsome...

1238
01:27:18,230 --> 01:27:19,590
还体格健壮...
athletic...

1239
01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:23,430
是啊 他显然是在模仿我
Yes, he's clearly modeling himself on me.

1240
01:27:23,670 --> 01:27:25,750
这倒不犯法
That's no crime.

1241
01:27:27,230 --> 01:27:28,510
我在想...
I wonder...

1242
01:27:30,390 --> 01:27:34,230
有没有哪条古老的法律...
I wonder if some ancient law might exist...

1243
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:38,520
禁止渔夫问问题?
that forbids bargemen from asking questions.

1244
01:27:40,110 --> 01:27:44,110
你觉得如此珍贵的法条会存在吗?
You think such a venerable statute might exist?

1245
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:48,520
简直是一定的 大人
Almost certainly, sire.

1246
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:53,550
我立刻写一条
I'll write one immediately.

1247
01:27:58,110 --> 01:28:00,390
你选错人...
You picked the wrong man...

1248
01:28:00,630 --> 01:28:03,440
挑衅了 巴德老爷
to tangle with, Master Bard.

1249
01:28:03,870 --> 01:28:05,670
希望你能管好自己...
I hope you're watching yourself...

1250
01:28:05,950 --> 01:28:07,550
因为我在看着呢
because I'll be watching you.

1251
01:28:16,670 --> 01:28:17,750
把手拿开
Get your hands off me.

1252
01:28:25,230 --> 01:28:27,110
你没见过他们 他们也从没来过
You didn't see them. They were never here.

1253
01:28:28,790 --> 01:28:30,390
这些鱼白送给你了
The fish you can have for nothing.

1254
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:34,870
跟紧点
Stay close.

1255
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:39,590
跟我来
Follow me.

1256
01:28:39,830 --> 01:28:40,830
这是哪里?
What is this place?

1257
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:43,870
这里 巴金斯先生 就是人类的领地
This, Mr. Baggins, is the world of Men.

1258
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:45,390
快点把东西搬过来
Get it over here now.

1259
01:28:45,630 --> 01:28:47,630
抓住另一头 就这样
Grab the other end. That's it.

1260
01:28:48,670 --> 01:28:50,080
低下头 一直走
Keep your head's down, keep moving.

1261
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:51,310
快点
Quickly, now.

1262
01:28:51,510 --> 01:28:54,430
天啊 到底还有多少?
God, how many more are there?

1263
01:28:55,870 --> 01:28:56,870
站住
Halt.

1264
01:28:57,550 --> 01:28:58,270
喂!
Oi!

1265
01:28:58,550 --> 01:28:59,110
快点 快跑
Come on. Move.

1266
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:00,830
以长湖镇镇长的名义...
In the name of the Master of Lake-town...

1267
01:29:01,070 --> 01:29:02,070
我说了站住
I said halt.

1268
01:29:02,630 --> 01:29:03,630
站住!
Halt!

1269
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:05,590
拦住他们!
Stop them!

1270
01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:08,330
- 后退  - 过来
- Get back.  - Come here.

1271
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:32,550
这里出了什么事?
What's going on here?

1272
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:37,150
站在原地 全都不准走
Stay where you are. Nobody leaves.

1273
01:29:45,830 --> 01:29:46,550
布拉加
Braga.

1274
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:47,830
- 怎么了?  - 你
- Sorry?  - You.

1275
01:29:49,790 --> 01:29:51,070
你在找什么东西 巴德?
What are you up to, Bard?

1276
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:52,350
我?
Me?

1277
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:53,470
没有啊
Nothing.

1278
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:54,950
我没在找什么东西
I'm looking for nothing.

1279
01:29:58,470 --> 01:29:59,470
好啊
Yeah.

1280
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:07,430
嘿 布拉加
Hey, Braga.

1281
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:10,680
你老婆穿这个一定很好看
Your wife would look lovely in this.

1282
01:30:12,790 --> 01:30:14,120
你都知道我老婆的哪些事?
What do you know of my wife?

1283
01:30:15,550 --> 01:30:17,310
就和镇上其他男人一样多呀
I know her as well as any man in this town.

1284
01:30:32,270 --> 01:30:33,350
爸!
Da!

1285
01:30:33,830 --> 01:30:35,630
我们家被人监视了
Our house, it's being watched.

1286
01:31:12,070 --> 01:31:14,630
你可以告诉镇长 我今天的工作都完成了
You can tell the Master I'm done for the day.

1287
01:31:15,710 --> 01:31:18,070
爸! 你去哪里了?
Da! Where have you been?

1288
01:31:18,350 --> 01:31:21,320
父亲! 你回来了! 我担心死了
Father! There you are! I was worried.

1289
01:31:21,670 --> 01:31:23,080
给你 西格丽德
Here, Sigrid.

1290
01:31:23,630 --> 01:31:24,630
巴恩 让他们进来
Bah, get them in.

1291
01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:34,950
如果你跟任何人说起这事...
If you speak of this to anyone...

1292
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:36,630
我就把你的手拧下来
I'll rip your arms off.

1293
01:31:39,510 --> 01:31:41,000
别碰我
Get off.

1294
01:31:42,430 --> 01:31:43,510
从那上去
Up there.

1295
01:31:51,270 --> 01:31:52,270
爸...
Da...

1296
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:54,590
为什么这些矮人会从我们的马桶里爬出来?
why are there Dwarves climbing out of our toilet?

1297
01:31:54,830 --> 01:31:56,160
他们会给我们带来好运吗?
Will they bring us luck?

1298
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:01,590
衣服可能不怎么合身...
They may not be the best fit...

1299
01:32:01,830 --> 01:32:03,590
但能让你们暖和起来
but they'll keep you warm.

1300
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:05,310
非常感谢你
Thank you very much.

1301
01:32:15,510 --> 01:32:17,590
矮人的风弩
A Dwarvish windlance.

1302
01:32:17,910 --> 01:32:20,030
你看上去像见到鬼了
You look like you've seen a ghost.

1303
01:32:20,790 --> 01:32:21,950
确实是
He has.

1304
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:23,750
我们最后一次看到...
The last time we saw...

1305
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:25,670
这种弓弩时...
such a weapon...

1306
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:28,310
镇上烽火四起
a city was on fire.

1307
01:32:29,630 --> 01:32:31,870
巨龙到来的那天
It was the day the dragon came.

1308
01:32:35,110 --> 01:32:37,950
也是史矛革摧毁长湖镇的那天
The day that Smaug destroyed Dale.

1309
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:42,630
长湖镇长吉瑞安...
Girion, the Lord of the City...

1310
01:32:42,870 --> 01:32:43,630
召集他的弓箭手...
rallied his bowmen...

1311
01:32:43,870 --> 01:32:44,990
齐力进攻巨龙
to fire upon the beast.

1312
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:47,870
但龙的鳞甲非常坚硬
But a dragon's hide is tough.

1313
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:50,630
比最结实的战甲还要坚硬
Tougher than the strongest armor.

1314
01:32:50,870 --> 01:32:54,070
只有用风弩发射的黑箭...
Only a Black Arrow fired from a windlance...

1315
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:55,910
才能穿透龙甲
could have pierced the dragon's hide.

1316
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:57,910
但这种箭...
And few of those...

1317
01:32:58,150 --> 01:32:59,950
却很稀少
arrows were ever made.

1318
01:33:05,270 --> 01:33:06,390
当吉瑞安发起最后一击时...
The store was running low...

1319
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:08,750
这种箭已经所剩无几
when Girion made his last stand.

1320
01:33:16,710 --> 01:33:20,110
如果那天吉瑞安真的射中了龙...
Had the aim of Men been true that day...

1321
01:33:20,710 --> 01:33:22,550
一切都会不同了
much would have been different.

1322
01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:28,590
说得好像你当时在场似的
You speak as if you were there.

1323
01:33:29,950 --> 01:33:32,070
所有矮人都知道这个传说
All Dwarves know the tale.

1324
01:33:32,390 --> 01:33:34,590
那你应该知道吉瑞安射中了巨龙
Then you would know that Girion hit the dragon.

1325
01:33:34,830 --> 01:33:36,710
他在龙的左翼留下了一处伤疤
He loosened a scale under the left wing.

1326
01:33:36,990 --> 01:33:38,910
再多一击 就可以杀死巨龙
One more shot and he would have killed the beast.

1327
01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:42,070
这只是一个传说
That's a fairy story, lad.

1328
01:33:42,310 --> 01:33:43,720
仅此而已
Nothing more.

1329
01:33:44,710 --> 01:33:46,070
你收了我们的钱
You took our money.

1330
01:33:47,150 --> 01:33:48,430
那我们的武器呢?
Where are the weapons?

1331
01:33:51,030 --> 01:33:52,230
在这等着
Wait here.

1332
01:34:06,710 --> 01:34:07,430
明天就是...
Tomorrow begins...

1333
01:34:07,670 --> 01:34:08,750
秋天的最后一天了
the last days of autumn.

1334
01:34:08,910 --> 01:34:11,190
都林之日从后天早上开始
Durin's Day falls the morn after next.

1335
01:34:11,430 --> 01:34:13,350
我们必须在那之前赶到孤山
We must reach the mountain before then.

1336
01:34:13,590 --> 01:34:14,950
要是我们没赶上呢?
And if we do not?

1337
01:34:15,190 --> 01:34:17,510
如果在时限之前 我们没能找到秘门呢?
If we fail to find the hidden door before that time?

1338
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:19,230
那这次远征就毫无意义了
Then this quest has been for nothing.

1339
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:32,790
这是什么?
What is this?

1340
01:34:33,350 --> 01:34:34,630
长矛钩
Pike hook.

1341
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:36,030
用旧鱼叉改造的
Made from an old harpoon.

1342
01:34:36,630 --> 01:34:38,790
- 这个呢?  - 我们叫它"柄锤"
- And this?  - A crowbill, we call it.

1343
01:34:39,030 --> 01:34:40,600
照着铁匠铺的锤子打造的
Fashioned from a smithy's hammer.

1344
01:34:40,830 --> 01:34:42,350
它拿在手里有些沉...
It's heavy in hand, I grant...

1345
01:34:42,590 --> 01:34:45,350
但是自卫之时 聊胜于无
but in defense of your life, these will serve you better than none.

1346
01:34:45,590 --> 01:34:48,310
我们给你钱是买武器的
We paid you for weapons.

1347
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:50,120
我们要的是真刀实枪的...
Iron-forged swords...

1348
01:34:50,350 --> 01:34:51,350
铁家伙!
and axes!

1349
01:34:51,590 --> 01:34:52,590
这简直是儿戏!
It's a joke!

1350
01:34:54,670 --> 01:34:57,240
在镇上兵器库之外 你找不到更好的了
You won't find better outside the city armory.

1351
01:34:57,470 --> 01:34:58,830
所有的真家伙都被锁在...
All iron-forged weapons are held there...

1352
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:00,310
兵器库里了
under lock and key.

1353
01:35:00,550 --> 01:35:01,590
梭林...
Thorin...

1354
01:35:02,230 --> 01:35:04,190
我们何不拿上这些就出发呢?
why not take what's on offer and go?

1355
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:05,550
我赤手空拳都可以
I've made do with less.

1356
01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:06,830
你们也是
So have you.

1357
01:35:08,950 --> 01:35:11,110
- 要我说 我们现在就出发  - 你们哪也不能去
- I say we leave now.  - You're not going anywhere.

1358
01:35:11,350 --> 01:35:12,540
你说什么? 
What did you say?

1359
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:13,790
有探子在监视这所房子...
There are spies watching this house...

1360
01:35:14,030 --> 01:35:16,710
甚至镇上所有码头都可能被监视了
and probably every dock and wharf in the town.

1361
01:35:17,310 --> 01:35:19,190
你们必须要等到天黑
You must wait till nightfall.

1362
01:35:35,590 --> 01:35:36,750
梭林
Thorin.

1363
01:35:49,790 --> 01:35:50,910
爸?
Da?

1364
01:35:54,110 --> 01:35:55,550
别让他们离开
Don't let them leave.

1365
01:36:27,670 --> 01:36:28,670
陶瑞尔...
Tauriel...

1366
01:36:29,470 --> 01:36:32,790
你不可能凭一己之力猎杀三十个奥克
you cannot hunt 30 Orcs on your own.

1367
01:36:32,910 --> 01:36:34,790
但我不是一个人在战斗
But I'm not on my own.

1368
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:36,910
你知道我会跟来的
You knew I would come.

1369
01:36:39,550 --> 01:36:41,110
国王很生气 陶瑞尔
The King is angry, Tauriel.

1370
01:36:41,430 --> 01:36:44,390
六百年来我父亲一直保护你 宠爱你
For 600 years my father has protected you, favored you.

1371
01:36:45,510 --> 01:36:46,870
你却违抗了他的命令
You defied his orders.

1372
01:36:47,110 --> 01:36:48,520
背叛了他的信任
You betrayed his trust.

1373
01:36:58,510 --> 01:37:00,080
国王从未允许奥克...
The King has never let Orc filth...

1374
01:37:00,310 --> 01:37:01,310
进入我们的家园
roam our lands.

1375
01:37:01,510 --> 01:37:04,790
这次他却允许奥克越过我们的边境 追杀我们的囚徒
Yet he would let this Orc pack cross our borders and kill our prisoners.

1376
01:37:05,070 --> 01:37:06,350
这不是我们的战斗
It is not our fight.

1377
01:37:06,590 --> 01:37:08,110
这就是我们的战斗
It is our fight.

1378
01:37:08,630 --> 01:37:10,350
它不会就此结束
It will not end here.

1379
01:37:10,590 --> 01:37:13,480
它们每胜利一次 邪恶就会增长一分
With every victory, this evil will grow.

1380
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:16,480
如果你父王固执已见 我们也束手无策
If your father has his way, we will do nothing.

1381
01:37:16,750 --> 01:37:18,830
我们只能东躲西藏...
We will hide within our walls...

1382
01:37:19,070 --> 01:37:21,390
过着暗无天日的生活...
live our lives away from the light...

1383
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:23,190
放任邪恶胡作非为
and let darkness descend.

1384
01:37:25,070 --> 01:37:27,150
我们不是这个世界的一份子吗?
Are we not part of this world?

1385
01:37:28,150 --> 01:37:28,750
告诉我
Tell me,

1386
01:37:29,590 --> 01:37:33,070
我们何曾允许邪恶凌驾于我们?
When did we let evil become stronger than us?

1387
01:37:37,950 --> 01:37:40,680
你好 巴德 你在找什么?
Hello, Bard. What you after?

1388
01:37:41,710 --> 01:37:43,280
这里曾经有一块挂毯!
There was a tapestry!

1389
01:37:43,990 --> 01:37:46,110
很古老的那种! 哪去了?
An old one! Where's it gone?

1390
01:37:46,350 --> 01:37:47,630
说的是什么挂毯?
What tapestry you talking about?

1391
01:37:47,910 --> 01:37:48,910
就是这个
This one.

1392
01:37:49,470 --> 01:37:52,310
我跟你们说 他们是凭空冒出来的一群矮人
They were Dwarves, I tell you. Appeared out of nowhere.

1393
01:37:52,390 --> 01:37:54,550
满脸络腮胡子 眼神凶恶
Full beards. Fierce eyes.

1394
01:37:54,830 --> 01:37:56,430
我从没见过长那样的人
I've never seen the like.

1395
01:37:56,710 --> 01:37:58,790
矮人到我们这里来干什么?
What are Dwarves doing in these parts?

1396
01:37:59,030 --> 01:38:00,630
- 这是预言  - 什么预言?
- It's the prophecy.  - The prophecy?

1397
01:38:00,870 --> 01:38:02,670
关于都林族矮人的预言
The Prophecy of Durin's Folk.

1398
01:38:12,070 --> 01:38:13,510
预言
Prophecy.

1399
01:38:17,270 --> 01:38:18,350
预言
Prophecy.

1400
01:38:18,590 --> 01:38:19,870
那个古老的传说看来是真的了
The old tales will come true.

1401
01:38:20,150 --> 01:38:22,390
巨额的金银财宝!
Vast halls of treasure!

1402
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:24,790
数不清的金银珠宝
Silver and gold and jewels beyond measure.

1403
01:38:25,070 --> 01:38:26,070
你能想象吗?
Can you imagine?

1404
01:38:26,270 --> 01:38:27,430
这是真的吗?
Can it really be true?

1405
01:38:27,670 --> 01:38:30,400
银泉之王要回归了吗?
Has the lord of silver fountains returned?

1406
01:38:30,710 --> 01:38:33,280
银泉之王
The lord of the silver fountains.

1407
01:38:33,510 --> 01:38:35,790
石雕之王
The King of carven stone.

1408
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:39,630
孤山之王
The King beneath the mountain

1409
01:38:40,830 --> 01:38:42,750
将回归他的王国!
shall come into his own!

1410
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:45,950
欢乐的钟声将会响起
And the bell shall ring in gladness

1411
01:38:46,190 --> 01:38:48,550
庆祝孤山之王的回归
at the Mountain King's return.

1412
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:51,520
然而世间万物将化为乌有
But all shall fail in sadness.

1413
01:38:52,190 --> 01:38:54,840
长湖终将生灵涂炭
And the lake will shine and burn.

1414
01:38:57,830 --> 01:38:59,030
爸 我已经尽力阻止他们了
Da, I tried to stop them.

1415
01:38:59,030 --> 01:39:00,470
他们离开多久了?
How long have they been gone?

1416
01:39:04,590 --> 01:39:06,310
- 能看到东西吗?  - 嘘! 小声点
- Can you see anything?  - Shh! Keep it down.

1417
01:39:06,510 --> 01:39:09,470
我们一拿到武器就直接往孤山赶
As soon as we have the weapons we make straight for the mountain.

1418
01:39:09,710 --> 01:39:10,910
快 快 快
Go, go, go.

1419
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:12,470
快 诺瑞
Go, Nori.

1420
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:16,590
下一个
Next.

1421
01:39:22,070 --> 01:39:23,070
预言?
Prophecy?

1422
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:25,510
是谁又提起了那段古老的胡话?
Who dragged up that old nonsense?

1423
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:27,470
是人们 大人
People, sire.

1424
01:39:27,710 --> 01:39:28,710
他们在街头聚集
They're gathering in the streets.

1425
01:39:28,950 --> 01:39:32,030
他们说孤山之王将要回归
They're saying that a king will return to the Lonely Mountain...

1426
01:39:32,270 --> 01:39:35,990
而河水将再一次流淌出金子
and that the rivers will once more run with gold.

1427
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:38,550
金河? 胡说
Rivers of gold? Poppycock.

1428
01:39:40,590 --> 01:39:41,590
您说的是 大人
As you say, sire.

1429
01:39:42,710 --> 01:39:44,670
但人们只会相信他们愿意信的
But people will believe what they want to believe.

1430
01:39:45,670 --> 01:39:48,270
他们已经一贫如洗很久了
It's been a long time since they've seen any riches.

1431
01:39:48,510 --> 01:39:51,910
古老的传说能给予他们希望
The old tales offer them hope.

1432
01:40:01,710 --> 01:40:02,870
你行吗?
You all right?

1433
01:40:03,110 --> 01:40:04,390
没问题
I can manage.

1434
01:40:05,150 --> 01:40:06,750
赶紧离开这里
Let's just get out of here.

1435
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:21,750
快跑!
Run!

1436
01:40:21,870 --> 01:40:22,990
快点! 快跑!
Quickly! Move now!

1437
01:40:37,150 --> 01:40:38,350
放开我! 放开!
Get off me! Get off!

1438
01:40:38,590 --> 01:40:40,190
把他们带到这儿来
Move them along here.

1439
01:40:41,310 --> 01:40:42,310
快走!
Move on!

1440
01:40:50,950 --> 01:40:52,840
这是什么情况?
What is the meaning of this?

1441
01:40:53,430 --> 01:40:55,790
我们当场抓住了偷兵器的 大人
We caught them stealing weapons, sire.

1442
01:40:55,990 --> 01:40:58,310
哦 我们的敌人... 嗯?
Ah. Enemies of the state, eh?

1443
01:40:58,550 --> 01:41:01,750
他们可能是一群雇佣兵 大人
A desperate bunch of mercenaries, if ever there was, sire.

1444
01:41:01,990 --> 01:41:03,230
闭嘴!
Hold your tongue!

1445
01:41:05,830 --> 01:41:07,910
你知不知道你在跟谁说话
You do not know to whom you speak.

1446
01:41:08,510 --> 01:41:10,390
这可不是寻常的小偷
This is no common criminal.

1447
01:41:10,670 --> 01:41:12,030
他是梭林...
This is Thorin...

1448
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:15,390
是瑟莱因之子 瑟罗尔之孙!
son of Thrain, son of Thror!

1449
01:41:18,550 --> 01:41:20,630
我们是埃瑞博的矮人
We are the Dwarves of Erebor.

1450
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:26,510
我们来重夺我们的家园
We have come to reclaim our homeland.

1451
01:41:31,230 --> 01:41:34,230
我还记得长湖镇昔日繁华的盛景
I remember this town in the great days of old.

1452
01:41:35,550 --> 01:41:37,590
港口停泊着满载丝绸...
Fleets of boats lay at harbor...

1453
01:41:37,830 --> 01:41:39,640
和宝石的船队
filled with silks and fine gems.

1454
01:41:40,630 --> 01:41:42,830
那时的长湖镇丝毫不显破败
This was no forsaken town on a lake.

1455
01:41:43,870 --> 01:41:46,550
这里曾是整个北方的贸易中心!
This was the center of all trade in the North!

1456
01:41:48,390 --> 01:41:50,430
我希望看到繁华再现
I would see those days return.

1457
01:41:50,670 --> 01:41:53,190
我希望重振矮人族的雄风...
I would relight the great forges of the Dwarves...

1458
01:41:53,430 --> 01:41:57,110
让财富再次从埃瑞博的大殿内流淌出来!
send wealth and riches flowing once more from the Halls of Erebor!

1459
01:42:00,110 --> 01:42:01,110
死亡!
Death!

1460
01:42:01,910 --> 01:42:04,430
这才是你将带给我们的!
That is what you will bring upon us!

1461
01:42:05,310 --> 01:42:07,490
毁灭一切的龙焰
Dragon fire and ruin.

1462
01:42:09,470 --> 01:42:11,350
如果你惊醒了那头巨兽...
If you waken that beast...

1463
01:42:11,990 --> 01:42:13,590
它会杀光我们所有人
it will destroy us all.

1464
01:42:13,830 --> 01:42:15,670
你们也可以听这个唱反调的...
You can listen to this naysayer...

1465
01:42:15,910 --> 01:42:17,560
但我向你们保证
but I promise you this:

1466
01:42:19,950 --> 01:42:21,390
如果我们成功了
If we succeed...

1467
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:25,270
我们将共享孤山的财富
all will share in the wealth of the mountain.

1468
01:42:29,670 --> 01:42:34,190
你们将拥有黄金万两 足以重建埃斯加洛斯十次!
You will have enough gold to rebuild Esgaroth 10 times over!

1469
01:42:44,830 --> 01:42:46,830
我们为什么要相信你说的话?
Why should we take you at your word?

1470
01:42:47,150 --> 01:42:48,720
我们根本不了解你
We know nothing about you.

1471
01:42:50,630 --> 01:42:52,150
有谁能保证你的人品?
Who here can vouch for your character?

1472
01:42:59,910 --> 01:43:00,910
我
Me.

1473
01:43:03,030 --> 01:43:04,030
我愿意替他担保
I'll vouch for him.

1474
01:43:04,670 --> 01:43:07,110
我和这些矮人...
I have traveled far...

1475
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:09,470
长途跋涉 历经千险...
with these Dwarves through great danger...

1476
01:43:09,710 --> 01:43:12,950
如果梭林・橡木盾...
and if Thorin Oakenshield...

1477
01:43:13,230 --> 01:43:14,350
保证了的话...
gives his word...

1478
01:43:15,310 --> 01:43:17,470
他就会信守承诺
then he will keep it.

1479
01:43:20,270 --> 01:43:21,430
各位!
All of you!

1480
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:22,910
请听我说!
Listen to me!

1481
01:43:23,150 --> 01:43:24,190
请务必听我说!
You must listen!

1482
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:26,150
大家都忘了河谷城的遭遇了吗?
Have you forgotten what happened to Dale?

1483
01:43:27,990 --> 01:43:31,190
都忘了那些葬身火海的人了吗?!
Have you forgotten those who died in the firestorm?!

1484
01:43:33,470 --> 01:43:34,470
为了什么?
And for what purpose?

1485
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:37,710
为了那想成为孤山之王的野心...
The blind ambition of a Mountain King...

1486
01:43:38,590 --> 01:43:42,350
他被贪婪驱使 被自身的渴望蒙蔽了双眼!
so riven by greed, he could not see beyond his own desire!

1487
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:45,190
安静 安静!
Now, now!

1488
01:43:45,510 --> 01:43:47,470
大伙儿谁都别急着...
We must not, any of us...

1489
01:43:47,710 --> 01:43:50,070
推卸责任
be too quick to lay blame.

1490
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:53,750
大家都别忘了...
Let us not forget that it was...

1491
01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:55,790
是长湖镇长吉瑞安...
Girion, Lord of Dale...

1492
01:43:56,070 --> 01:43:57,720
也就是你的祖先...
your ancestor...

1493
01:43:57,990 --> 01:44:00,470
没能把龙杀死!
who failed to kill the beast!

1494
01:44:03,030 --> 01:44:04,990
这是真的 大人
It's true, sire.

1495
01:44:05,230 --> 01:44:06,430
我们都知道这个故事
We all know the story.

1496
01:44:08,030 --> 01:44:09,710
他射了一箭又一箭
Arrow after arrow, he shot.

1497
01:44:09,950 --> 01:44:12,520
但都没能命中
Each one missing its mark.

1498
01:44:19,270 --> 01:44:20,550
你没有权力
You have no right.

1499
01:44:22,230 --> 01:44:24,150
没有权力进山
No right to enter that mountain.

1500
01:44:25,870 --> 01:44:27,990
我是唯一有权力进去的
I have the only right.

1501
01:44:34,350 --> 01:44:35,710
敢问长湖镇的...
I speak to the Master...

1502
01:44:35,950 --> 01:44:37,440
一镇之长
of the Men of the Lake.

1503
01:44:37,670 --> 01:44:39,990
你愿意看到预言成真吗?
Will you see the prophecy fulfilled?

1504
01:44:40,950 --> 01:44:41,950
你愿意...
Will you...

1505
01:44:42,270 --> 01:44:46,030
分享我族的巨大财富吗?
share in the great wealth of our people?

1506
01:44:51,030 --> 01:44:52,470
你说呢?
What say you?

1507
01:44:56,350 --> 01:44:59,390
我会对你说...
I say unto you...

1508
01:45:00,670 --> 01:45:01,670
欢迎!
Welcome!

1509
01:45:02,190 --> 01:45:03,190
欢迎!
Welcome!

1510
01:45:03,230 --> 01:45:04,230
再说一次...
And thrice...

1511
01:45:04,470 --> 01:45:05,470
欢迎你...
welcome...

1512
01:45:05,710 --> 01:45:07,360
山下之王!
King Under the Mountain!

1513
01:45:19,430 --> 01:45:21,950
你知道我们少了一个人吧? 波弗在哪?
You do know we're one short. Where's Bofur?

1514
01:45:22,190 --> 01:45:24,790
- 他不在这 我们要把他留下  - 我们必须如此
- If he's not here, we leave him behind.  - We'll have to.

1515
01:45:25,070 --> 01:45:28,840
要想在黄昏前找到大门 我们耽搁不起了
If we're to find the door before nightfall, we can risk no more delays.

1516
01:45:33,230 --> 01:45:34,230
你不能上
Not you.

1517
01:45:34,830 --> 01:45:37,030
我们必须快速前进 你会拖慢我们
We must travel at speed. You will slow us down.

1518
01:45:38,310 --> 01:45:40,190
你说什么呢? 我要跟你们一起走
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.

1519
01:45:40,350 --> 01:45:41,350
现在不行
Not now.

1520
01:45:46,990 --> 01:45:48,830
大门开启时我要在场
I'm going to be there when that door is opened.

1521
01:45:48,910 --> 01:45:51,150
当看到父辈的大厅时我要在场 梭林
When we first look upon the Halls of our Fathers, Thorin.

1522
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:53,510
基利 留在这
Kili, stay here.

1523
01:45:54,110 --> 01:45:55,270
好好休息
Rest.

1524
01:45:56,070 --> 01:45:57,510
痊愈了之后再加入我们
Join us when you're healed.

1525
01:46:03,110 --> 01:46:04,440
我要跟他一起
I'll stay with the lad.

1526
01:46:04,670 --> 01:46:06,470
我的任务是照顾病人
My duty lies with the wounded.

1527
01:46:06,710 --> 01:46:07,710
舅舅
Uncle.

1528
01:46:08,550 --> 01:46:10,270
我们听着孤山的故事长大
We grew up on tales of the mountain.

1529
01:46:10,510 --> 01:46:11,790
是你告诉我们的
Tales you told us.

1530
01:46:12,030 --> 01:46:14,190
- 你不能剥夺他亲眼见证的机会!  - 菲利
- You cannot take that away from him!  - Fili.

1531
01:46:14,430 --> 01:46:15,510
必要的话 我可以背着他!
I will carry him if I must!

1532
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:18,150
等你有天成为了国王 你就明白了
One day you will be King and you will understand.

1533
01:46:18,910 --> 01:46:22,190
我不能为了一个矮人而置远征的结果于不顾
I cannot risk the fate of this quest for the sake of one Dwarf.

1534
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:25,270
是我的亲人也不行
Not even my own kin.

1535
01:46:28,950 --> 01:46:29,950
菲利 别傻了
Fili, don't be a fool.

1536
01:46:30,790 --> 01:46:31,910
你应该跟大伙一起
You belong with the company.

1537
01:46:32,030 --> 01:46:33,680
我要跟弟弟在一起
I belong with my brother.

1538
01:46:45,190 --> 01:46:49,030
天啊 时间到了?! 啊!
By my beard, is that the time?! Ah!

1539
01:46:50,110 --> 01:46:53,150
带着我们的祝福和期许...
Go now with our goodwill...

1540
01:46:53,390 --> 01:46:54,800
上路吧
and good wishes.

1541
01:46:56,110 --> 01:46:58,920
- 愿你们带着财富归来...  - 等等!
- And may your return bring good fortune...  - Wait!

1542
01:46:59,150 --> 01:47:00,270
与众共享
To all!

1543
01:47:04,710 --> 01:47:05,750
再见
Goodbye.

1544
01:47:12,230 --> 01:47:12,830
都让开!
Out of the way!

1545
01:47:13,070 --> 01:47:14,430
不! 不!
No! No!

1546
01:47:21,030 --> 01:47:23,070
哈 你们也错过上船时间了吗?
Ha. So you missed the boat as well?

1547
01:47:23,710 --> 01:47:24,870
基利? 基利!
Kili? Kili!

1548
01:47:26,270 --> 01:47:27,710
嘿
Hey.

1549
01:47:27,990 --> 01:47:29,870
全都让开 快让开
Get out of there. Go on.

1550
01:47:31,550 --> 01:47:33,310
真是妙举 大人
Masterfully handled, sire.

1551
01:47:33,550 --> 01:47:35,510
您的威望从未如此高过
Your popularity has never been so high.

1552
01:47:35,790 --> 01:47:37,710
整个镇子都在传颂您的名字
The entire town twittering your name.

1553
01:47:37,950 --> 01:47:39,790
当然 这是聪明的决定
Yes, it was rather clever.

1554
01:47:40,030 --> 01:47:42,190
无论那些小个子能不能凯旋而归...
Either our little friends return triumphant...

1555
01:47:42,430 --> 01:47:45,400
我要么能发一笔横财...
in which case, I stand to make a pretty penny...

1556
01:47:45,670 --> 01:47:48,750
要么史矛戈就能用矮人填个几天肚子
or old Smaug dines on Dwarf for a day or two.

1557
01:47:49,750 --> 01:47:51,630
重要的是 他们不再是我们的麻烦了
The important thing is, they're off our hands.

1558
01:47:51,870 --> 01:47:52,870
请等等
Please, wait.

1559
01:47:53,990 --> 01:47:55,270
拜托 我们需要你的帮助
Please. We need your help.

1560
01:47:55,510 --> 01:47:57,080
- 我弟弟病了  - 病了?
- My brother is sick.  - Sick?

1561
01:47:57,350 --> 01:47:58,590
传染性的吗?
Is it infectious?

1562
01:47:58,830 --> 01:47:59,550
后退
Get back.

1563
01:47:59,790 --> 01:48:01,360
阿尔弗雷德...
Alfrid, Alfrid...

1564
01:48:01,590 --> 01:48:03,390
- 别让他们再靠近了  - 求你了
- don't let them come any closer.  - Please.

1565
01:48:03,430 --> 01:48:05,110
我们需要药品
We need medicine.

1566
01:48:06,470 --> 01:48:08,150
我看上去像药剂师吗?
Do I look like an apothecary?

1567
01:48:08,790 --> 01:48:09,990
我们给予的还不够吗?
Haven't we given you enough?

1568
01:48:10,230 --> 01:48:11,390
镇长是个大忙人
The Master's a busy man.

1569
01:48:11,630 --> 01:48:14,470
他没有时间来关心病了的矮人
He hasn't got time to worry about sick Dwarves.

1570
01:48:15,150 --> 01:48:16,150
你们快点走开
Be gone with you. Go on.

1571
01:48:16,350 --> 01:48:17,630
别赖在这儿
Clear off.

1572
01:48:17,910 --> 01:48:20,990
阿尔弗雷德 这个镇子需要一次好好的清理
What this town needs, Alfrid, is a good purge.

1573
01:48:21,230 --> 01:48:25,150
就从那些胆敢质疑我威信的闹事者开始
Starting with a certain troublemaker who saw fit to question my authority.

1574
01:48:25,390 --> 01:48:28,120
- 某个船夫对吗 大人?  - 正是
- A certain bargeman, sire?  - Precisely.

1575
01:48:30,710 --> 01:48:31,710
不
No.

1576
01:48:31,950 --> 01:48:33,600
我受够矮人了 走开
I'm done with Dwarves. Go away.

1577
01:48:33,830 --> 01:48:35,670
别 别... 别! 求你了!
No, no... no! Please!

1578
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:38,270
没人帮助我们 基利病了
No one will help us. Kili's sick.

1579
01:48:40,870 --> 01:48:41,950
病得非常严重
He's very sick.

1580
01:49:21,310 --> 01:49:23,470
太安静了
So quiet.

1581
01:49:23,710 --> 01:49:26,710
也不是一直如此
Wasn't always like this.

1582
01:49:26,950 --> 01:49:32,110
曾经 这些山坡都种满了树木
Once, these slopes were lined with woodlands.

1583
01:49:32,350 --> 01:49:33,550
树林里...
The trees...

1584
01:49:33,790 --> 01:49:36,110
满是鸟儿的欢唱
were filled with birdsong.

1585
01:49:40,190 --> 01:49:41,390
放松点 巴金斯老爷
Relax, Master Baggins.

1586
01:49:42,470 --> 01:49:46,270
我们有食物 有武器 时间也足够
We have food, we have tools, and we're making good time.

1587
01:49:59,630 --> 01:50:01,280
这是什么地方?
What is this place?

1588
01:50:01,510 --> 01:50:03,510
曾经是河谷城所在
It was once the city of Dale.

1589
01:50:04,790 --> 01:50:06,470
现在只是一片废墟
Now it is a ruin.

1590
01:50:07,230 --> 01:50:09,430
史矛革荒漠
The desolation of Smaug.

1591
01:50:09,670 --> 01:50:11,590
太阳快到中天了
The sun will soon reach midday.

1592
01:50:11,830 --> 01:50:14,270
在太阳下山之前 我们必须找到进山的秘门
We must find the hidden door into the mountain before it sets.

1593
01:50:14,350 --> 01:50:15,350
这边
This way.

1594
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:17,470
慢着 这是望城之处吗?
Wait. Is this the overlook?

1595
01:50:17,790 --> 01:50:19,150
甘道夫说在这里会合
Gandalf said to meet him here.

1596
01:50:19,390 --> 01:50:21,230
- 千万别自己...  - 你看到他了吗?
- On no account were we to...  - Do you see him?

1597
01:50:21,670 --> 01:50:22,350
我们没时间...
We have no time...

1598
01:50:22,590 --> 01:50:24,000
等巫师了
to wait upon the Wizard.

1599
01:50:24,270 --> 01:50:26,030
我们得靠自己了 走吧!
We're on our own. Come!

1600
01:50:43,150 --> 01:50:44,910
多古尔都
Dol Guldur.

1601
01:50:45,190 --> 01:50:47,350
法师的巢穴
The Hill of Sorcery.

1602
01:50:47,590 --> 01:50:49,830
看起来完全荒废了
It looks completely abandoned.

1603
01:50:50,110 --> 01:50:51,550
本该如此
As it is meant to.

1604
01:50:52,670 --> 01:50:56,750
有咒语遮掩着这里 说明...
A spell of concealment lies over this place, which means...

1605
01:50:57,590 --> 01:51:00,670
大敌尚未准备好显露真身
our Enemy is not yet ready to reveal himself.

1606
01:51:02,630 --> 01:51:05,990
他还没有完全恢复力量
He has not regained his full strength.

1607
01:51:06,430 --> 01:51:09,790
拉达加斯特 我要你带信给加拉德瑞尔夫人
Radagast, I need you to carry a message to the Lady Galadriel.

1608
01:51:10,030 --> 01:51:12,230
告诉她 我们必须逼他出手
Tell her we must force his hand.

1609
01:51:12,470 --> 01:51:13,550
什么意思?
What do you mean?

1610
01:51:13,790 --> 01:51:15,360
我要一个人进去
I'm going in alone.

1611
01:51:15,710 --> 01:51:18,110
千万不要跟着我
On no account come after me.

1612
01:51:24,270 --> 01:51:25,550
保证吗?
Do I have your word?

1613
01:51:25,790 --> 01:51:27,790
好 好 我保证!
Yes, yes, yes!

1614
01:51:39,510 --> 01:51:41,000
甘道夫 等等!
Wait, Gandalf!

1615
01:51:42,150 --> 01:51:44,070
如果是陷阱怎么办?!
What if it's a trap?!

1616
01:51:44,910 --> 01:51:48,910
转过身去 不要回头
Turn around and do not come back.

1617
01:51:53,790 --> 01:51:56,630
这无疑是个陷阱
It's undoubtedly a trap.

1618
01:52:39,990 --> 01:52:40,710
找到了吗?
Anything?

1619
01:52:40,950 --> 01:52:42,870
没有
Nothing.

1620
01:52:46,430 --> 01:52:47,590
如果地图是真的...
If the map is true...

1621
01:52:48,550 --> 01:52:51,310
秘门就在我们正上方
the hidden door lies directly above us.

1622
01:52:55,590 --> 01:52:57,470
在上面!
Up here!

1623
01:53:05,630 --> 01:53:08,280
眼睛很敏锐啊 巴金斯老爷
You have keen eyes, Mr. Baggins.

1624
01:56:08,790 --> 01:56:10,870
瑟莱因?
Thrain?

1625
01:56:11,870 --> 01:56:14,350
瑟罗尔之子?
Son of Thror?

1626
01:56:16,830 --> 01:56:18,480
我的老朋友
My old friend.

1627
01:56:20,670 --> 01:56:22,790
甘道夫?
Gandalf?

1628
01:56:29,550 --> 01:56:31,750
太久了
A lifetime.

1629
01:56:33,550 --> 01:56:37,230
我在这里待太久了
I have been here a lifetime.

1630
01:56:37,470 --> 01:56:38,910
真的很抱歉...
I'm so sorry...

1631
01:56:39,150 --> 01:56:41,030
我以为你死了
I gave you up for dead.

1632
01:56:43,350 --> 01:56:45,920
我有个儿子
I had a son.

1633
01:56:47,710 --> 01:56:49,390
我要和你一起战斗
I will fight with you.

1634
01:56:55,630 --> 01:56:56,630
梭林
Thorin.

1635
01:56:56,750 --> 01:56:59,950
你会再见到他的 我的朋友
And you will see him again, my friend.

1636
01:57:00,230 --> 01:57:02,270
来吧 我们必须离开
Come, we must leave.

1637
01:57:02,510 --> 01:57:04,910
奥克占领了墨瑞亚
The Orcs had taken Moria.

1638
01:57:05,190 --> 01:57:07,350
战争 我们当时在打仗
War. We were at war.

1639
01:57:09,710 --> 01:57:12,070
我被包围了
I was surrounded.

1640
01:57:14,350 --> 01:57:15,710
亵渎者
The Defiler.

1641
01:57:18,470 --> 01:57:22,190
"亵渎者"阿佐格来了
Azog the Defiler had come.

1642
01:58:10,590 --> 01:58:12,670
他们拿走了
They took it.

1643
01:58:12,910 --> 01:58:15,110
七戒中的最后一枚
The last of the seven.

1644
01:58:18,950 --> 01:58:20,350
来吧 我带你离开这里
Come on, let's get you out of here.

1645
01:58:22,470 --> 01:58:23,470
没有出去的路
There is no way out.

1646
01:58:24,510 --> 01:58:26,630
它们会拦住你
They will stop you.

1647
01:58:26,870 --> 01:58:27,870
那些蛇...
The serpents...

1648
01:58:27,950 --> 01:58:30,310
会拦住你
will stop you.

1649
01:58:33,710 --> 01:58:34,710
那是幻觉
It's an illusion.

1650
01:58:37,590 --> 01:58:39,470
只是幻觉罢了
Just an illusion.

1651
01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:44,630
他们对你做了什么?
What have they done to you?

1652
01:58:44,910 --> 01:58:45,910
我没有告诉他们
I never told them.

1653
01:58:46,150 --> 01:58:49,150
他们逼迫我 但我一个字都没说
They tried to make me, but I never said a word.

1654
01:58:51,870 --> 01:58:55,790
你有没有保管好 甘道夫? 地图和钥匙?
Have you kept them safe, Gandalf? The map and the key?

1655
01:58:56,750 --> 01:58:57,910
我把它们给了梭林
I gave them to Thorin.

1656
01:58:58,390 --> 01:58:59,390
你会为他骄傲的
You'd be proud of him.

1657
01:58:59,510 --> 01:59:01,870
他远征去夺回埃瑞博
He's taken up the quest to reclaim Erebor.

1658
01:59:02,110 --> 01:59:03,110
埃瑞博
Erebor.

1659
01:59:03,830 --> 01:59:05,270
他会拿回阿肯宝石
He will retrieve the Arkenstone.

1660
01:59:05,510 --> 01:59:06,870
矮人的七支军队...

1661
01:59:06,990 --> 01:59:08,590
会听从新国王的号召

1662
01:59:08,650 --> 01:59:09,510
不 不
No. No.

1663
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:11,910
梭林不能靠近埃瑞博
Thorin must not go near Erebor.

1664
01:59:13,390 --> 01:59:16,200
谁都不能进那座山
No one must enter that mountain.

1665
01:59:47,710 --> 01:59:48,790
肯定就是它了
This must be it.

1666
01:59:50,990 --> 01:59:52,510
隐蔽之门
The hidden door.

1667
01:59:56,750 --> 01:59:58,510
让那些怀疑我们的人...
Let all those who doubted us...

1668
01:59:59,670 --> 02:00:01,030
后悔去吧!
rue this day!

1669
02:00:06,750 --> 02:00:09,190
好了 我们有钥匙
Right, then. We have a key.

1670
02:00:10,910 --> 02:00:12,400
也就是说...
Which means that somewhere...

1671
02:00:13,510 --> 02:00:14,920
某处有个锁眼
there is a key-hole.

1672
02:00:15,630 --> 02:00:18,520
"都林之日的最后一束光...
"The last light of Durin's Day...

1673
02:00:20,510 --> 02:00:21,510
将会照射在...

1674
02:00:21,590 --> 02:00:23,000
锁眼之上"
the key-hole."

1675

诺瑞
Nori.

1676
02:00:39,830 --> 02:00:41,790
光线要消失了 快
We're losing the light. Come on.

1677
02:00:48,310 --> 02:00:50,910
安静! 你拳打脚踢的 我听不清
Be quiet! I can't hear when you're thumping.

1678
02:00:51,150 --> 02:00:52,150
我找不到
I can't find it.

1679
02:00:53,390 --> 02:00:54,750
不在这!
It's not here!

1680
02:00:54,990 --> 02:00:56,070
根本不在这!
It's not here!

1681
02:00:57,830 --> 02:00:59,190
- 把门砸开!  - 好
- Break it down!  - Aye.

1682
02:01:00,910 --> 02:01:01,910
加把劲!
Come on!

1683
02:01:03,870 --> 02:01:04,630
用力砸!
Break!

1684
02:01:04,870 --> 02:01:05,870
肯定能砸开
It has to break.

1685
02:01:06,830 --> 02:01:08,160
没用的
It's no good.

1686
02:01:08,430 --> 02:01:10,910
门被封闭了 用蛮力是打不开的
The door's sealed. Can't be opened by force.

1687
02:01:12,550 --> 02:01:14,290
上面有强大的魔法
There's a powerful magic on it.

1688
02:01:23,310 --> 02:01:24,430
不可能!
No!

1689
02:01:29,790 --> 02:01:32,070
"都林之日的最后一束光...

will shine upon the key-hole."

1691
02:01:39,950 --> 02:01:41,550
上面就是这么说的
That is what it says.

1692
02:01:46,030 --> 02:01:47,470
我们遗漏了什么?
What did we miss?

1693
02:01:51,430 --> 02:01:52,870
我们漏了什么?
What did we miss?

1694

巴林?
Balin?

1695
02:01:55,510 --> 02:01:57,230
光已经消失了
We've lost the light.

1696
02:01:59,750 --> 02:02:01,590
我们无能为力
There's no more to be done.

1697
02:02:03,150 --> 02:02:05,230
我们只有一次机会
We had but one chance.

1698
02:02:07,630 --> 02:02:08,910
走吧 大伙
Come away, lads.

1699
02:02:09,150 --> 02:02:10,950
都结束了
It's over.

1700
02:02:12,030 --> 02:02:14,150
- 等等  - 我们太晚了
- Wait a minute.  - We're too late.

1701
02:02:16,670 --> 02:02:18,080
他们去哪啊?
Where are they going?

1702
02:02:19,870 --> 02:02:21,750
不能现在放弃!
You can't give up now!

1703
02:02:36,670 --> 02:02:37,830

Thorin.

1704
02:02:39,870 --> 02:02:41,550
现在不能放弃
You can't give up now.

1705

你会告诉我儿子 我爱他吧?

你得自己告诉他

1785
02:11:12,910 --> 02:11:14,560
太迟了
It is too late.

1786
02:12:38,150 --> 02:12:40,960

1787
02:13:03,550 --> 02:13:04,630

我听得到你的呼吸
I hear your breath.

1802

我感觉到...

1804
02:17:32,670 --> 02:17:35,190
你在哪里?
Where are you?

1805
02:17:36,670 --> 02:17:37,750
你在哪里?
Where are you?

1806

02:18:11,150 --> 02:18:14,350
你有点奇怪
There is something about you.

1811
02:18:17,750 --> 02:18:19,790
是你带的某样东西

金子打造之物

阴影中的小偷

我不是来偷您东西的...
I did not come to steal from you...

1819
02:18:44,470 --> 02:18:45,470
史矛革...
Oh Smaug...

1820
02:18:45,510 --> 02:18:48,750
拥有无人能及的财富 我只是想...
the Unassessably Wealthy. I merely wanted...

1821
02:18:49,030 --> 02:18:50,630
瞻仰一下您的威严
to gaze upon your magnificence.

1822
02:18:50,990 --> 02:18:51,990
看您是否...
To see...

1823
02:18:52,070 --> 02:18:55,040
像古老传说中那样伟大
if you really were as great as the old tales say.

1824
02:18:55,750 --> 02:18:57,470
我不相信那些故事
I did not believe them.

1825
02:19:06,310 --> 02:19:10,230
那么现在呢?!
And do you now?!

1826
02:19:11,590 --> 02:19:12,830
是真的...
Truly...

1827
02:19:14,150 --> 02:19:16,350
那些故事和歌谣...
the tales and songs...

1828
02:19:17,470 --> 02:19:20,200
还远未表出您的凶猛...
fall utterly short of your enormity...

1829
02:19:20,430 --> 02:19:23,400
巨龙史矛革啊
Oh Smaug the Stupendous.

1830
02:19:23,630 --> 02:19:26,520
你以为奉承可以让你活命吗?
Do you think flattery will keep you alive?

1831

不 没有
No, no.

1832
02:19:28,230 --> 02:19:29,720
确实不会
No, indeed.

1833
02:19:31,990 --> 02:19:35,230
你看来很熟悉我的名字...
You seem familiar with my name...

1834
02:19:35,470 --> 02:19:38,360
但我却不曾闻到过你这种气味
but I don't remember smelling your kind before.

1835
02:19:39,470 --> 02:19:41,070
你是谁...
Who are you...

1836
02:19:41,310 --> 02:19:43,830
从哪儿来...
and where do you come from...

1837
02:19:44,070 --> 02:19:46,390
恕我好奇?
may I ask?

1838
02:19:55,950 --> 02:19:57,630
我从山下而来
I come from under the hill.

1839
02:19:57,990 --> 02:19:59,400
山下?
Underhill?

1840
02:20:03,110 --> 02:20:04,110
我翻越了...
And under hills...

1841
02:20:04,230 --> 02:20:06,230
千山万岭
and over hills my path has led.

1842
02:20:07,110 --> 02:20:08,110
然后...
And... and...

1843
02:20:08,710 --> 02:20:11,070
在空气中穿梭 我可以隐身行走
through the air. I am he who walks unseen.

1844
02:20:11,310 --> 02:20:13,030
令人敬佩
Impressive.

1845
02:20:13,270 --> 02:20:15,310
你还有什么名头?
What else do you claim to be?

1846
02:20:16,270 --> 02:20:17,270
我是...
I am...

02:20:28,470 --> 02:20:29,550
骑桶者

1852
02:20:29,790 --> 02:20:33,190
木桶? 越来越有趣了
Barrels? Now that is interesting.

1853
02:20:34,670 --> 02:20:38,600
那你的小矮人朋友呢?
And what about your little Dwarf friends?

1854
02:20:39,710 --> 02:20:40,950
他们藏在哪儿?
Where are they hiding?

1855
02:20:43,830 --> 02:20:45,400
矮人?
Dwarves?

1856
02:20:46,230 --> 02:20:47,310
不
No.

1857
02:20:47,990 --> 02:20:49,510
不 不 这里没有矮人
No, no. No Dwarves here.

1858
02:20:49,750 --> 02:20:50,830
你搞错了
You've got that all wrong.

1859
02:20:51,110 --> 02:20:54,870
我没搞错 骑桶者!
Oh, I don't think so, Barrel-rider!

1860
02:20:55,430 --> 02:20:56,670
他们打发你来...
They sent you in here...

1861
02:20:56,950 --> 02:20:58,910
做些坏事 自己却...
to do their dirty work while they...

1862
02:20:59,150 --> 02:21:01,110
躲在外面
skulk about outside.

1863
02:21:02,350 --> 02:21:03,510
你真的...
Truly...

02:21:04,310 --> 02:21:05,470
搞错了...
you are mistaken...

1865
02:21:05,750 --> 02:21:08,750
最令人敬畏的史矛革
Oh Smaug, Chiefest and Greatest of Calamities.

1866
02:21:08,990 --> 02:21:12,390
作为一个小偷...
You have nice manners...

1867
02:21:12,630 --> 02:21:15,830
和骗子来说 你很有礼貌!
for a thief and a liar!

1868
02:21:17,110 --> 02:21:20,510
我清楚矮人的气息和味道
I know the smell and taste of Dwarf.

1869
02:21:20,950 --> 02:21:22,150
比谁都清楚!
No one better!

1870
02:21:23,870 --> 02:21:25,280
他们为金子而来!
It is the gold!

1871
02:21:25,510 --> 02:21:29,360
他们爱金子 就像苍蝇爱腐肉
They are drawn to treasure like flies to dead flesh.

1872
02:21:32,910 --> 02:21:34,150
你以为我不知道...
Did you think I did not know...

1873
02:21:34,590 --> 02:21:36,080
会有这么一天吗?!
this day would come?!

1874
02:21:37,950 --> 02:21:40,800
不知道那群伪善的矮人...
That a pack of canting Dwarves...

1875
02:21:41,030 --> 02:21:45,150
总有一天会会爬上山来吗?!
would come crawling back to the mountain?!

1876
02:21:49,710 --> 02:21:50,910
是地震吗?
Was that an earthquake?

1877
02:21:51,150 --> 02:21:53,270
这动静 伙计...
That, my lad...

1878
02:21:56,510 --> 02:21:57,950
是条龙
was a dragon.

1879
02:22:06,270 --> 02:22:07,270
爸?
Da?

1880
02:22:07,350 --> 02:22:08,950
从山上传来的
It's coming from the mountain.

1881
02:22:13,030 --> 02:22:14,270
你先走吧
You should leave us.

1882
02:22:14,550 --> 02:22:15,190
带上你的孩子
Take your children.

1883
02:22:15,430 --> 02:22:16,430
离开这里
Get out of here.

1884
02:22:16,990 --> 02:22:18,270
去哪儿?
And go where?

1885
02:22:19,350 --> 02:22:20,760
没有地方可以去
There is nowhere to go.

1886
02:22:22,710 --> 02:22:24,230
我们会死吗 爸?
Are we going to die, Da?

1887
02:22:26,270 --> 02:22:27,430
不会的 亲爱的
No, darling.

1888
02:22:27,710 --> 02:22:28,270
那条龙
The dragon.

1889
02:22:28,550 --> 02:22:29,990
会杀了我们的
It's going to kill us.

1890
02:22:40,670 --> 02:22:42,470
我先杀了它就不会了
Not if I kill it first.

1891
02:22:43,910 --> 02:22:47,590
山下之王已经死了
The King Under the Mountain is dead.

1892
02:22:47,830 --> 02:22:49,510
我登上了他的王座
I took his throne.

1893
02:22:49,870 --> 02:22:53,830
吃了他的人民 就像羊群中的狼
I ate his people like a wolf among sheep.

1894
02:22:57,590 --> 02:22:58,750
无论何时何地...
I kill where...

1895
02:22:59,030 --> 02:23:00,630
我想杀...
I wish, when...

1896
02:23:00,910 --> 02:23:02,350
就杀
I Wish.

1897
02:23:02,590 --> 02:23:05,910
我的盔甲坚不可摧
My armor is iron.

1898
02:23:15,070 --> 02:23:17,510
刀枪不入
No blade can pierce me.

1899
02:23:20,670 --> 02:23:21,910
好 走吧
All right.

1900
02:23:22,150 --> 02:23:24,510
一支黑箭? 为什么你没和我说过?
A Black Arrow? Why did you never tell me?

1901
02:23:24,750 --> 02:23:26,400
因为你没必要知道
Because you did not need to know.

1902
02:23:33,990 --> 02:23:35,510
好好听着
Listen to me carefully.

1903
02:23:35,870 --> 02:23:38,030
我需要你引开卫兵
I need you to distract the guards.

1904
02:23:38,590 --> 02:23:41,510
我一登上塔顶 就会把箭装上
Once I'm at the top of the tower, I'll set the arrow to the bow.

1905
02:23:41,990 --> 02:23:42,550
他在那!
There he is!

1906
02:23:42,730 --> 02:23:43,490
巴德!
Bard!

1907
02:23:43,630 --> 02:23:45,830
- 追他!  - 快点! 在下面! 快!
- After him!  - Quickly! Down there. Go!

1908
02:23:46,070 --> 02:23:47,070
拦住他!
Stop him!

1909
02:23:54,110 --> 02:23:55,110
拦住他!
Stop him!

1910
02:23:55,830 --> 02:23:56,830
站住!
Stop!

1911
02:24:00,590 --> 02:24:02,240
巴恩! 巴恩
Bain! Bain.

1912
02:24:03,070 --> 02:24:06,750
把箭藏好 不要让人找到 我来对付他们
Keep it safe. Don't let anyone find it. I'll deal with them.

1913
02:24:06,990 --> 02:24:08,710
- 我不会离开你  - 现在快跑!
- I'm not leaving you.  - Now go!

1914
02:24:12,670 --> 02:24:13,310
布拉加
Braga.

1915
02:24:13,550 --> 02:24:14,190
你已被逮捕
You're under arrest.

1916
02:24:14,430 --> 02:24:17,320
- 什么罪?  - 镇长说是什么罪就什么罪
- On what charge?  - Any charge the Master chooses.

1917
02:24:47,310 --> 02:24:48,720
他去哪儿了?
Where's he gone?

1918
02:24:59,990 --> 02:25:01,070
比尔博怎么办?
What about Bilbo?

1919
02:25:01,310 --> 02:25:02,310
给他点时间
Give him more time.

1920
02:25:02,550 --> 02:25:04,710
给他时间干嘛? 等着被杀吗?
Time to do what? To be killed?

1921
02:25:07,190 --> 02:25:08,430
你怕了
You're afraid.

1922
02:25:10,110 --> 02:25:12,390
对 我怕了
Yes, I'm afraid.

1923
02:25:13,550 --> 02:25:14,910
我怕你现在的样子
I fear for you.

1924
02:25:16,270 --> 02:25:18,430
那件宝藏会带来贪欲
A sickness lies upon that treasure hoard.

1925
02:25:18,870 --> 02:25:19,870
你的祖父...
A sickness which drove...

1926
02:25:19,910 --> 02:25:21,190
就是那么疯的
your grandfather mad.

1927
02:25:21,470 --> 02:25:23,040
我和我的祖父不一样
I am not my grandfather.

1928
02:25:23,270 --> 02:25:25,030
你连自己都迷失了
You're not yourself.

1929
02:25:25,910 --> 02:25:28,030
我认识的梭林会毫不犹豫进去的...
The Thorin I know would not hesitate to go in there...

1930
02:25:28,310 --> 02:25:28,870
我不会...
I will not risk...

1931
02:25:29,110 --> 02:25:32,910
为救一个飞贼而冒险的
this quest for the life of one burglar.

1932
02:25:34,790 --> 02:25:36,230
他有名字
Bilbo.

1933
02:25:36,590 --> 02:25:38,510
叫比尔博
His name is Bilbo.

1934
02:25:42,270 --> 02:25:44,070
是橡木盾...
It's Oakenshield...

1935
02:25:44,350 --> 02:25:47,320
那个可恶的矮人篡位者
that filthy Dwarvish usurper.

1936
02:25:49,550 --> 02:25:51,710
是他派你...
He sent you in here...

1937
02:25:51,950 --> 02:25:54,710
来拿阿肯宝石 对吧?
for the Arkenstone, didn't he?

1938
02:25:54,950 --> 02:25:55,590
不 不...
No. No...

1939
02:25:55,830 --> 02:25:58,720
不 我不知道你在说什么
no. I don't know what you're talking about.

1940
02:25:58,950 --> 02:26:00,070
不用否认了
Don't bother denying it.

1941
02:26:01,470 --> 02:26:03,270
我早就猜到了他的阴谋诡计
I guessed his foul purpose some time ago.

1942
02:26:05,870 --> 02:26:07,470
但没关系
But it matters not.

1943
02:26:08,630 --> 02:26:10,990
橡木盾的计划不会得逞
Oakenshield's quest will fail.

1944
02:26:12,990 --> 02:26:14,750
黑暗即将来临
The darkness is coming.

1945
02:26:15,590 --> 02:26:19,590
淹没世界的每一个角落
It will spread to every corner of the land.

1946
02:27:02,190 --> 02:27:05,350
躲在阴影里的小偷 你被利用了
You are being used, thief in the shadows.

1947
02:27:05,790 --> 02:27:09,350
你永远只是达到目的的手段而已
You were only ever a means to an end.

1948
02:27:10,190 --> 02:27:13,600
胆小的橡木盾衡量过...
The coward Oakenshield has weighed...

1949
02:27:13,870 --> 02:27:15,440
你的生命价值了...
the value of your life...

1950
02:27:15,710 --> 02:27:17,870
你一文不值
and found it worth nothing.

1951
02:27:18,470 --> 02:27:19,670
不
No.

1952
02:27:20,390 --> 02:27:21,390
不
No.

1953
02:27:22,350 --> 02:27:23,350
不 你在说谎
No, you're lying.

1954
02:27:23,590 --> 02:27:24,750
他向你承诺什么了?
What did he promise you?

1955
02:27:25,190 --> 02:27:27,270
分你一份宝藏吗?
A share of the treasure?

1956
02:27:28,270 --> 02:27:29,430
说得好像宝藏...
As if it was his...

1957
02:27:29,670 --> 02:27:30,750
是他的一样
to give.

1958
02:27:31,590 --> 02:27:33,350
我不会放弃...
I will not part with...

1959
02:27:33,590 --> 02:27:34,590
一个子儿
a single coin.

1960
02:27:35,270 --> 02:27:37,790
一个都不会放弃
Not one piece of it.

1961
02:27:41,670 --> 02:27:42,670
我的牙齿...
My teeth...

1962
02:27:42,790 --> 02:27:43,990
尖如利剑
are swords.

1963
02:27:44,870 --> 02:27:48,190
我的爪子利如长矛
My claws are spears.

1964
02:27:50,310 --> 02:27:51,470
我的双翼...
My wings...

1965
02:27:52,110 --> 02:27:54,630
强如暴风
are a hurricane.

1966
02:28:00,270 --> 02:28:02,110
传说是真的
So it is true.

1967
02:28:02,470 --> 02:28:04,630
黑箭确实命中了目标
The Black Arrow found its mark.

1968
02:28:04,870 --> 02:28:05,870
你说什么?
What did you say?

1969
02:28:06,630 --> 02:28:10,520
我只是说我久闻您的大名...
I was just saying your reputation precedes you, O Smaug...

1970
02:28:10,750 --> 02:28:11,950
噢 君主史矛革
the Tyrannical.

1971
02:28:12,550 --> 02:28:13,630
您确实
Truly.

1972
02:28:13,870 --> 02:28:15,830
是世上无人能及的
You have no equal on this earth.

1973
02:28:20,270 --> 02:28:24,430
为了看到橡木盾痛苦...
I am almost tempted to let you take it...

1974
02:28:24,870 --> 02:28:26,870
我差点让你...
if only to see Oakenshield...

1975
02:28:27,150 --> 02:28:28,150
拿到宝石了
suffer.

1976
02:28:29,190 --> 02:28:30,270
这样就能...
Watch it...

1977
02:28:30,510 --> 02:28:32,030
看着宝石毁灭他
destroy him.

1978
02:28:32,510 --> 02:28:35,630
吞噬他的心灵...
Watch it corrupt his heart...

1979
02:28:36,310 --> 02:28:38,710
让他发狂
and drive him mad.

1980
02:28:41,910 --> 02:28:43,480
但我想还是不要了
But I think not.

1981
02:28:44,070 --> 02:28:46,310
小游戏到此结束吧
I think our little game ends here.

1982
02:28:47,150 --> 02:28:48,390
告诉我...
So tell me...

1983
02:28:48,670 --> 02:28:49,670
小偷...
thief...

1984
02:28:50,430 --> 02:28:52,550
你想怎样死?
how do you choose to die?

1985
02:29:35,990 --> 02:29:36,990
不是
Nah.

1986
02:30:05,190 --> 02:30:07,230
爸? 是你吗 爸?
Da? Is that you, Da?

1987
02:30:40,350 --> 02:30:41,680
- 啊!  - 躲下去!
- Aah!  - Stay down!

1988
02:31:42,510 --> 02:31:43,510
趴下!
Get down!

1989
02:32:19,710 --> 02:32:20,870
你把他们都杀了
You killed them all.

1990
02:32:21,110 --> 02:32:22,190
还有其他的
There are others.

1991
02:32:22,630 --> 02:32:23,710
陶瑞尔
Tauriel.

1992
02:32:24,190 --> 02:32:25,310
我们走
Come.

1993
02:32:29,350 --> 02:32:30,350
他快死了
We're losing him.

1994
02:32:34,230 --> 02:32:35,430
陶瑞尔
Tauriel.

1995
02:33:05,630 --> 02:33:06,710
你要做什么?
What are you doing?

1996
02:33:09,710 --> 02:33:11,430
我要救他
I'm going to save him.

1997
02:33:32,190 --> 02:33:33,670
- 你还活着!  - 活不了多久了!
- You're alive!  - Not for much longer.

1998
02:33:33,750 --> 02:33:36,720
- 你找到阿肯宝石了吗? 阿肯宝石  - 龙追来了
- Did you find the Arkenstone? The Arkenstone.  - The dragon's coming.

1999
02:33:39,670 --> 02:33:41,240
你找到了吗?
Did you find it?

2000
02:33:46,750 --> 02:33:47,830
我们要赶紧离开
We have to get out.

2001
02:33:51,550 --> 02:33:52,550
梭林
Thorin.

2002
02:33:56,270 --> 02:33:57,390
梭林
Thorin.

2003
02:34:27,830 --> 02:34:29,950
我要烧死你们!
You will burn!

2004
02:34:31,110 --> 02:34:32,110
- 跑!  - 啊!
- Run!  - Ah!

2005
02:34:39,110 --> 02:34:40,190
快点 比尔博!
Come on, Bilbo!

2006
02:34:53,070 --> 02:34:54,110
快走
Come on.

2007
02:35:11,270 --> 02:35:12,470
压住他
Hold him down.

2008
02:35:28,870 --> 02:35:30,590
呃! 蒂尔达
Unh! Tilda.

2009
02:36:23,470 --> 02:36:24,670
嘘 小声点!
Shh, Shh, Shh!

2010
02:36:32,510 --> 02:36:33,950
我们甩开它了
We've given him the slip.

2011
02:36:34,190 --> 02:36:35,190
不
No.

2012
02:36:35,670 --> 02:36:37,870
它可狡猾了
He's too cunning for that.

2013
02:36:39,630 --> 02:36:40,750
那现在去哪儿?
So where to now?

2014
02:36:41,350 --> 02:36:42,680
西边的警卫室
The western guardroom.

2015
02:36:43,390 --> 02:36:44,910
可能有路可逃
There may be a way out.

2016
02:36:45,190 --> 02:36:47,190
那里太高了 没可能...
It's too high. There's no chance...

2017
02:36:47,430 --> 02:36:49,510
- 逃出去  - 那是我们唯一的机会
- that way.  - it's our only chance.

2018
02:36:50,830 --> 02:36:52,320
我们只能放手一搏
We have to try.

2019
02:37:08,870 --> 02:37:10,030
来
Come on.

2020
02:37:57,550 --> 02:38:01,310
我听过精灵神药的传说
I've heard tell of the wonders of Elvish medicine.

2021
02:38:01,550 --> 02:38:04,280
今天有幸亲眼看到了
That was a privilege to witness.

2022
02:38:06,750 --> 02:38:07,910
陶瑞尔
Tauriel.

2023
02:38:12,230 --> 02:38:13,430
躺着别动
Lie still.

2024
02:38:20,630 --> 02:38:22,750
你不可能是她
You cannot be her.

2025
02:38:26,230 --> 02:38:28,390
她在遥远的地方
She is far away.

2026
02:38:32,590 --> 02:38:34,000
她离我...
She is far...

2027
02:38:34,230 --> 02:38:35,830
很远很远
far away from me.

2028
02:38:37,470 --> 02:38:39,590
她行走在...
She walks...

2029
02:38:39,830 --> 02:38:42,510
另一个世界的星光之下
in starlight in another world.

2030
02:38:47,830 --> 02:38:49,790
只是个梦而已
It was just a dream.

2031
02:39:01,470 --> 02:39:03,710
你觉得她爱过我吗?
Do you think she could've loved me?

2032
02:39:11,030 --> 02:39:12,030
跟紧一点
Stay close.

2033
02:39:22,430 --> 02:39:23,430
到尽头了
That's it, then.

2034
02:39:24,470 --> 02:39:26,310
无路可走
There's no way out.

2035
02:39:32,710 --> 02:39:34,950
我们同胞的尸骨
The last of our kin.

2036
02:39:38,630 --> 02:39:40,710
他们肯定带着...
They must have come here...

2037
02:39:41,390 --> 02:39:42,430
巨大的希望...
hoping...

2038
02:39:42,670 --> 02:39:43,830
来到这里
beyond hope.

2039
02:39:53,590 --> 02:39:55,910
我们可以下到金矿里
We could try to reach the mines.

2040
02:39:56,750 --> 02:39:58,990
也许能撑上几天
We might last a few days.

2041
02:40:01,150 --> 02:40:02,190
不
No.

2042
02:40:05,150 --> 02:40:07,390
我不会这样死去的
I will not die like this.

2043
02:40:08,750 --> 02:40:09,910
蜷缩着
Cowering.

2044
02:40:10,790 --> 02:40:12,590
挣扎着 奄奄一息
Clawing for breath.

2045
02:40:17,510 --> 02:40:18,630
我们引它去熔炉
We make for the forges.

2046
02:40:18,910 --> 02:40:20,870
它会看到我们的 必死无疑
He'll see us, sure as death.

2047
02:40:21,110 --> 02:40:22,350
如果我们分头行事就不会
Not if we split up.

2048
02:40:22,590 --> 02:40:23,590
梭林...
Thorin...

2049
02:40:23,830 --> 02:40:25,320
我们绝对逃不掉了
we'll never make it.

2050
02:40:25,550 --> 02:40:27,070
也许有人能逃掉
Some of us might.

2051
02:40:27,470 --> 02:40:29,710
引它去熔炉
Lead him to the forges.

2052
02:40:30,470 --> 02:40:32,470
我们要杀掉恶龙
We kill the dragon.

2053
02:40:34,190 --> 02:40:36,470
若一切注定焚尽...
If this is to end in fire...

2054
02:40:36,910 --> 02:40:39,310
那我们也将同赴火海
then we will all burn together.

2055
02:40:40,630 --> 02:40:41,790
这边
This way.

2056
02:40:46,270 --> 02:40:47,270
逃吧
Flee.

2057
02:40:47,950 --> 02:40:48,950
逃吧
Flee.

2058
02:40:49,870 --> 02:40:51,830
逃命吧
Run for your lives.

2059
02:40:52,590 --> 02:40:53,590
你们...
There is...

2060
02:40:54,110 --> 02:40:56,310
无处可藏了
nowhere to hide.

2061
02:40:56,550 --> 02:40:57,550
看你背后!
Behind you!

2062
02:40:57,750 --> 02:40:58,750
小虫子!
Worm!

2063
02:40:59,750 --> 02:41:00,750
来!
Come on!

2064
02:41:02,790 --> 02:41:03,830
快跑!
Run!

2065
02:41:05,790 --> 02:41:07,070
嘿 你!
Hey, you!

2066
02:41:07,430 --> 02:41:08,430
这里!
Here!

2067
02:44:06,150 --> 02:44:08,110
这边 是这边!
This way. It's this way!

2068
02:44:08,390 --> 02:44:09,510
来!
Come on!

2069
02:44:09,750 --> 02:44:10,750
梭林!
Thorin!

2070
02:44:16,110 --> 02:44:17,230
跟着巴林!
Follow Balin!

2071
02:44:18,430 --> 02:44:19,670
- 梭林!  - 快!
- Thorin.  - Come on!

2072
02:44:35,510 --> 02:44:36,870
梭林!
Thorin!

2073
02:44:45,950 --> 02:44:46,990
接着!
Hold on!

2074
02:45:20,830 --> 02:45:22,160
梭林!
Thorin!

2075
02:45:25,030 --> 02:45:26,600
走 走!
Go. Go!

2076
02:45:30,310 --> 02:45:33,990
这个计划行不通 这些熔炉是冰冷的
The plan's not gonna work. These furnaces are stone cold.

2077
02:45:34,230 --> 02:45:35,590
他说得对 我们...
He's right. We've no...

2078
02:45:35,830 --> 02:45:38,150
没有火能点着熔炉
fire hot enough to set them ablaze.

2079
02:45:40,710 --> 02:45:42,070
我们没有吗?
Have we not?

2080
02:45:43,630 --> 02:45:46,550
我不觉得你会那么容易以智取胜
I did not look to see you so easily outwitted.

2081
02:45:50,510 --> 02:45:51,150
你已经变得...
You have grown...

2082
02:45:51,390 --> 02:45:53,350
又慢又肥...
slow and fat...

2083
02:45:54,190 --> 02:45:55,190
你这臃肿的...
in your dotage...

2084
02:45:57,510 --> 02:45:58,670
老糊涂!
slug!

2085
02:46:00,070 --> 02:46:01,750
躲起来 快!
Take cover. Go!

2086
02:46:29,190 --> 02:46:29,870
邦伯!
Bombur!

2087
02:46:30,190 --> 02:46:31,600
让火烧得更猛些
Get those bellows working.

2088
02:46:31,830 --> 02:46:32,950
快!
Go!

2089
02:46:46,750 --> 02:46:47,310
比尔博!
Bilbo!

2090
02:46:47,590 --> 02:46:49,310
上去那儿 听我指令...
Up there. On my mark...

2091
02:46:49,590 --> 02:46:50,870
拉那条杠
pull that lever.

2092
02:47:01,390 --> 02:47:03,710
巴林! 你还能配制出闪火吗?
Balin! Can you still mix a flash-flame?

2093
02:47:03,950 --> 02:47:06,350
可以 只需要一会儿 来!
Aye. It'll only take a jiffy. Come on!

2094
02:47:08,110 --> 02:47:09,550
我们没有时间了
We don't have a jiffy.

2095
02:47:21,510 --> 02:47:22,630
硫磺在哪儿?
Where's the sulfur?

2096
02:47:23,030 --> 02:47:24,030
你知道自己...
You sure you know what...

2097
02:47:24,110 --> 02:47:25,110
在做什么吗?
you're doing?

2098
02:47:36,550 --> 02:47:37,550
快点!
Come on!

2099
02:47:59,630 --> 02:48:00,630
拉杠!
Now!

2100
02:49:57,070 --> 02:49:59,150
引它去众王之廊
Lead him to the Gallery of the Kings.

2101
02:50:47,230 --> 02:50:48,230
不要停下来 比尔博!
Keep going, Bilbo!

2102
02:50:48,790 --> 02:50:49,870
跑!
Run!

2103
02:51:35,190 --> 02:51:39,190
你以为能骗得了我吗 骑桶者?
You think you can deceive me, Barrel-rider?

2104
02:51:41,950 --> 02:51:44,950
你来自长湖镇
You have come from Lake-town.

2105
02:51:46,670 --> 02:51:47,950
这是...
This is some...

2106
02:51:48,190 --> 02:51:51,470
可恶的矮人和悲惨的长湖人...
sordid scheme hatched between these filthy Dwarves...

2107
02:51:51,710 --> 02:51:54,870
策划的阴谋
and those miserable tub-trading Lakemen.

2108
02:51:55,870 --> 02:51:57,790
那些带着...
Those sniveling cowards...

2109
02:51:58,030 --> 02:51:59,520
长弓和黑箭...
with their long bows...

2110
02:51:59,750 --> 02:52:02,590
哭哭啼啼的胆小鬼
and Black Arrows.

2111
02:52:02,950 --> 02:52:04,830
也许我该...
Perhaps it is time...

2112
02:52:05,110 --> 02:52:06,990
拜访一下他们
I paid them a visit.

2113
02:52:07,510 --> 02:52:08,750
不
Oh, no.

2114
02:52:10,630 --> 02:52:12,120
这不是他们的错!
This isn't their fault!

2115
02:52:12,350 --> 02:52:13,350
等等!
Wait!

2116
02:52:13,390 --> 02:52:14,990
你不能去长湖镇!
You cannot go to Lake-town!

2117
02:52:16,910 --> 02:52:19,070
你在乎他们...
You care about them...

2118
02:52:19,790 --> 02:52:21,030
对吧?
Do you?

2119
02:52:21,270 --> 02:52:22,270
那就好
Good.

2120
02:52:22,950 --> 02:52:25,360
你可以看着他们死去
Then you can watch them die.

2121
02:52:30,910 --> 02:52:32,030
这里!
Here!

2122
02:52:32,950 --> 02:52:33,950
你这个无知的废物
You witless worm.

2123
02:52:40,790 --> 02:52:42,200
是你
You.

2124
02:52:42,590 --> 02:52:45,070
我要拿回你偷的东西
I am taking back what you stole.

2125
02:52:49,110 --> 02:52:49,750
你...
You...

2126
02:52:50,030 --> 02:52:51,600
什么也...
will take nothing...

2127
02:52:51,870 --> 02:52:53,520
拿不回去...
from me...

2128
02:52:53,790 --> 02:52:54,950
矮人
Dwarf.

2129
02:52:55,430 --> 02:52:58,710
我打败了你们老一辈的...
I laid low your warriors...

2130
02:52:58,950 --> 02:53:00,550
战士
of old.

2131
02:53:00,830 --> 02:53:03,190
在人类心中...
I instilled terror in...

2132
02:53:03,430 --> 02:53:05,110
植入恐惧
the hearts of Men.

2133
02:53:06,270 --> 02:53:07,710
我才是...
I am...

2134
02:53:07,950 --> 02:53:11,630
山下之王
King Under the Mountain.

2135
02:53:12,070 --> 02:53:14,350
这不是你的王国
This is not your kingdom.

2136
02:53:14,590 --> 02:53:16,590
这是矮人之地
These are Dwarf lands.

2137
02:53:17,350 --> 02:53:18,350
这是矮人之金
This is Dwarf gold.

2138
02:53:20,670 --> 02:53:21,390
我们要...
And we will...

2139
02:53:21,630 --> 02:53:23,790
报仇
have our revenge.

2140
02:54:45,350 --> 02:54:46,350
报仇?!
Revenge?!

2141
02:54:47,990 --> 02:54:49,640
报仇?!
Revenge?!

2142
02:54:50,430 --> 02:54:54,350
我要让你知道什么叫报仇!
I will show you revenge!

2143
02:55:31,830 --> 02:55:32,870
听我说!
Listen to me!

2144
02:55:33,430 --> 02:55:35,710
你难道不知道是怎么回事吗?
Do you not know what is coming?

2145
02:55:38,150 --> 02:55:41,870
我是烈焰
I am fire.

2146
02:55:43,070 --> 02:55:45,550
我是...
I am...

2147
02:55:47,790 --> 02:55:49,120
死神
Death.

2148
02:55:57,830 --> 02:56:00,030
我们都做了什么?
What have we done?
