« The Hobbit »

2
00:01:09,886 --> 00:01:13,714
Bree - On the borders of the Shire

3
00:01:40,395 --> 00:01:44,215
The Prancing Pony

4
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:55,575
I'm dying of thirst over here.
Come on! Come on!

5
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:58,119
- Here you are.
Thank you kindly.

6
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:04,542
- Oh, watch it!
- Sorry, darling.

7
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,171
- There you are.
- Thank you.

8
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:16,846
Master Stadle.

9
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:48,378
Mind if I join you?

10
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:50,338
I'll have the same.

11
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:58,680
I should introduce myself.
My name is Gandalf.

12
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,391
Gandalf the Grey.

13
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,643
I know who you are.

14
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:07,146
Well, now. This is a fine chance.

15
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:13,027
What brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?

16
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:17,573
I received word that my father...

17
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:19,367
...had been seen wandering...

18
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:21,577
...the Wilds near Dunland.

19
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:24,497
I went looking.

20
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:26,749
I found no sign of him.

21
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,127
Thorin, it's been a long time...

22
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:31,254
...since anything but rumor was heard...

23
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:32,380
...of Thrain.

24
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,132
He still lives.

25
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:35,925
I am sure of it.

26
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:42,306
My father came to see you
before he went missing.

27
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:45,351
What did you say to him?

28
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:49,021
I urged him to march upon Erebor,
to rally...

29
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:51,107
...the seven armies of the Dwarves...

30
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:53,276
...to destroy the dragon and take back...

31
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:55,153
...the Lonely Mountain.

32
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:57,321
And I would say the same to you.

33
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,575
Take back your homeland.

34
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,582
This is no chance meeting,
is it, Gandalf?

35
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:09,750
No.

36
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,044
It is not.

37
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:14,005
The Lonely Mountain troubles me...

38
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:17,925
...Thorin. That dragon
has sat there long enough.

39
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:19,218
Sooner or later...

40
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:22,472
...darker minds will turn towards Erebor.

41
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:25,475
I ran into some unsavory characters...

42
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:28,019
...whilst traveling on the Greenway.

43
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:31,022
They mistook me for a vagabond.

44
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:32,482
I imagine they regretted that.

45
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:35,151
One of them was carrying a message.

46
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:38,946
It is Black Speech.

47
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:43,868
A promise of payment.

48
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:45,328
For what?

49
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:48,206
Your head.

50
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,376
Someone wants you dead.

51
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:56,839
Thorin, you can wait no longer.
You are...

52
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:58,758
...the heir to the Throne of Durin.

53
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,427
Unite the armies of the Dwarves.

54
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:03,804
Together, you have the might and power...

55
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:05,973
...to retake Erebor.

56
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:08,476
Summon a meeting
of the seven Dwarf families.

57
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:10,436
Demand they stand by their oath.

58
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:14,607
The seven armies swore that oath
to the one who wields the King's Jewel.

59
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:15,900
The Arkenstone.

60
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:17,735
It is the only thing that will...

61
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,529
...unite them,
and in case you have forgotten...

62
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:22,031
...that jewel was stolen by Smaug.

63
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,955
What if I were to help you reclaim it?

64
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:31,749
How?

65
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:35,044
The Arkenstone lies half a world away...

66
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,797
...buried beneath the feet
of a fire-breathing dragon.

67
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:39,215
Yes, it does.

68
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:43,135
Which is why we're going to need a burglar.

69
00:05:47,006 --> 00:05:49,236
12 Months Later ...

71
00:06:33,278 --> 00:06:39,285
The Desolation of Smaug

72
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,031
How close is the pack?

73
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:48,826
Too close. A couple of leagues, no more.
But that's not the worst of it.

74
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,579
- Have the Wargs picked up our scent?
Not yet. But they will do.

75
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:54,165
- We have another problem.
Did they see you?

76
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:54,999
They saw you.

77
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:55,917
No, that's not it.

78
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,251
What did I tell you?

79
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,794
Quiet as a mouse.

80
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,088
Excellent burglar material.

81
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:02,548
Will you listen? Will you just...

82
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:03,966
...listen?

83
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,260
I'm trying to tell you
there is something else out there.

84
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:10,890
What form did it take'?

85
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:12,600
Like a bear?

86
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,519
Ye- Yes, but bigger.

87
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,854
Much bigger.

88
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:18,940
You knew about this beast?

89
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:21,984
I say we double back.

90
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,320
And be run down by a pack of Ores?

91
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:26,280
There is a house...

92
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:31,994
...it's not far from here,
where we might take refuge.

93
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,496
Whose house?

94
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:34,956
Are they friend or foe?

95
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:37,500
Neither.

96
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:40,461
He will help us or...

97
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,588
...he Will kill us.

98
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:45,091
What choice do we have?

99
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:48,803
None.

100
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:57,561
Come on!

101
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,657
This way! Quickly!

102
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:10,533
Run!

103
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:14,495
Bombur, come on!

104
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,751
To the house!

105
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:23,379
Run!

106
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:33,222
Come on, get inside.

107
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:47,945
Open the door!

108
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,321
Quickly!

109
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,374
Push!
Push!

110
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:04,879
Dwalin!

111
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:05,713
Come on, lads!

112
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:11,594
What is...

113
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:12,595
...that?

114
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,181
That is our host.

115
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:21,937
His name is Beorn.

116
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,317
And he's a skin-changer.

117
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,945
Sometimes he's a huge black bear.

118
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:32,740
Sometimes he's a great strong man.

119
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,076
The bear is unpredictable...

120
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:37,536
...but the man can be reasoned with.
However...

121
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:40,998
...he is not overfond of Dwarves.

122
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:45,169
He's leaving.

123
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,379
Come away from there.

124
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,091
It's not natural. None of it.

125
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:52,301
It's obvious. He's under some...

126
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:53,469
...dark spell.

127
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:54,720
Don't be a fool.

128
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,348
He's under no enchantment but his own.

129
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:00,810
All right, now get some sleep. All of you.

130
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,395
You'll be safe here tonight.

131
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:09,235
I hope.

132
00:10:26,236 --> 00:10:28,436
Attack them now.

133
00:10:28,557 --> 00:10:31,557
Kill the Dwarf filth while they sleep.

134
00:10:32,358 --> 00:10:33,558
No.

135
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,259
The Beast stands guard.

136
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,260
We will kill them on the road.

137
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:02,361
They are gathering in Dol Guldur.

138
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:06,566
The Master has summoned you!

139
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:03,607
<i>one ring to rule them all ...</i>

140
00:12:03,814 --> 00:12:07,818
<i>one ring to find them ...</i>

141
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:17,009
<i>one ring to bring them,
and in the darkness bind them.</i>

142
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,670
We grow in number.

143
00:12:53,601 --> 00:12:56,571
We grow in strenght.

144
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:59,449
You will lead my armies.

145
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:01,547
What of Oakenshield?

146
00:13:04,548 --> 00:13:07,652
War is coming.

147
00:13:08,552 --> 00:13:10,554
You promised me his head.

148
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,456
Death will come to all.

149
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:21,461
Do we call off the hunt?

150
00:13:24,663 --> 00:13:26,665
Bolg!

151
00:13:40,426 --> 00:13:42,676
I have a task for you.

152
00:13:43,677 --> 00:13:47,680
Do you still thirst for Dwarf blood?

153
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:54,478
So you are the one they call Oakenshield.

154
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:56,480
Tell me...

155
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,065
...why is Azog...

156
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,275
...the Defiler hunting you?

157
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:02,319
You know of Azog?

158
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,113
How?

159
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:07,366
My people were the first to live
in the mountains...

160
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:11,328
...before the Ores came down
from the North.

161
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,665
The Defiler killed most of my family.

162
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:16,166
But some he...

163
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,501
...enslaved.

164
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,671
Not for work, you understand...

165
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,339
...but for sport.

166
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:24,758
Caging skin-changers...

167
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:28,804
...and torturing them
seemed to amuse him.

168
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:31,849
There are others like you?

169
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:34,935
Once there were many.

170
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:36,728
And now'?

171
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,232
Now there is only one.

172
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,986
You need to reach...

173
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:47,906
...the mountain before
the last days of autumn.

174
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:49,283
Before Durin's Day falls.

175
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:50,492
Yes.

176
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,578
You are running out of time.

177
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:55,038
Which is why we must
go through Mirkwood.

178
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:58,083
A darkness lies upon that forest.

179
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,336
Fell things creep beneath those trees.

180
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:05,174
There is an alliance
between the Ores of Moria...

181
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:08,302
...and the Necromancer in Dol Guldur.

182
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,470
I would not venture there...

183
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,764
...except in great need.

184
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,683
We will take the Elven Road.

185
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,018
That path is still safe.

186
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:17,227
"Safe"?

187
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,021
The Wood Elves of Mirkwood...

188
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:20,230
...are not like their kin.

189
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:22,316
They're less wise...

190
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,443
...and more dangerous.

191
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:27,488
But it matters not.

192
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:30,491
What do you mean?

193
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:33,493
These lands are crawling with Orcs.

194
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,955
Their numbers are growing.

195
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:38,665
And you are on foot.

196
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,542
You will never reach...

197
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,836
...the forest alive.

198
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:49,635
I don't like Dwarves.

199
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,304
They're greedy...

200
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,014
...and blind.

201
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:57,392
Blind to the lives of those they deem...

202
00:16:57,643 --> 00:17:00,103
...lesser than their own.

203
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:08,987
But Ores I hate more.

204
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,491
What do you need?

205
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:20,582
<i>BEORN".
Go now. While you have the light.</i>

206
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,418
<i>Your hunters are not far behind.</i>

207
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,778
The Elven Gate.

208
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,281
Here lies our path...

209
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,032
...through Mirkwood.

210
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:57,411
No sign of the Ores.
We have luck on our side.

211
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,795
Set the ponies loose.

212
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,881
Let them return to their master.

213
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,718
This forest...

214
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,386
...feels...

215
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:16,096
...sick.

216
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,765
As if a disease lies upon it.

217
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,894
Is there no way around?

218
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:25,606
Not unless we go 200 miles north.

219
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,941
Or twice that distance...

220
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,193
...south.

221
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:59,473
<i>Something moves in the shadows unseen...</i>

222
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,310
<i>...hidden from our sight.</i>

223
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:07,356
<i>Every day it grows in strength.</i>

224
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,942
<i>Beware the Necromancer.</i>

225
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,570
<i>He is not what he seems.</i>

226
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,578
<i>If our Enemy has returned,
we must know.</i>

227
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:25,707
<i>Go to the tombs in the mountains.</i>

228
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,627
The High Fells.

229
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,049
So be it.

230
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:38,970
Not my horse!

231
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:39,805
Ineediï¬

232
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:43,433
You're not leaving us?

233
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,435
I would not do this unless I had to.

234
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:53,360
You've changed...

235
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,362
...Bilbo Baggins.

236
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:59,783
You're not the same Hobbit
as the one who left the Shire.

237
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,246
I was going to tell you.

238
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,000
I...

239
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,964
...found something in the Goblin tunnels.

240
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,549
Found what?

241
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,139
What did you find?

242
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:26,852
My courage.

243
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,690
Good. Well, that's good.

244
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:36,361
You'll need it.

245
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:39,239
I'll be waiting for you
at the overlook, before...

246
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:40,615
...the slopes of Erebor.

247
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:43,243
Keep the map and key safe.

248
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:46,455
Do not enter that mountain without me.

249
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:55,630
This is not the Greenwood of old.

250
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:59,176
The very air of the forest
is heavy with illusion.

251
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:02,137
It'll seek to enter your mind
and lead you astray.

252
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:04,306
"Lead us astray"?

253
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:06,099
What does that mean?

254
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:09,603
You must stay on the path.
Do not leave it.

255
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,063
If you do, you'll never...

256
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:13,607
...find it again.

257
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:16,818
No matter what may come, stay on...

258
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:17,736
...the path!

259
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:21,156
Come on. We must reach the mountain
before the sun sets on Durin's Day.

260
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:22,407
Durin's Day?
Let's go.

261
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:25,160
It is our one chance
to find the hidden door.

262
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:37,547
The path turns this way.

263
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:04,783
This way.

264
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,545
Air. I need air.

265
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:18,838
My head, it's swimming!

266
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:20,173
What's happening?

267
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:21,841
Keep moving.

268
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:23,301
Nori...

269
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:25,679
...why have we stopped?

270
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:26,847
The path...

271
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:28,765
...it's disappeared.

272
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,058
What's going on?

273
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,852
We've lost the path!

274
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,187
Find it.

275
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:37,482
All of you, look. Look for the path!

276
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:48,910
I don't remember this bit.

277
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,787
None of it's familiar.

278
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,789
It's got to be here.

279
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:54,916
What hour is it?

280
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:58,670
I do not know. I do not even know
what day it is.

281
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:01,840
Is there no end to this accursed forest?!

282
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:17,647
Attercop.

283
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,509
Look.

284
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,386
A tobacco pouch.

285
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:51,056
There's Dwarves in these woods.

286
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,933
Dwarves from the Blue Mountains,
no less.

287
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:55,852
This is exactly the same as mine.

288
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,772
Because it is yours. Do you understand?

289
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:00,815
We're going around in circles.
We are lost.

290
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:03,109
We are not lost. We keep heading east.

291
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,987
But which way is east? We've lost the sun.

292
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:07,614
I thought you were the expert.

293
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,741
The sun.

294
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,243
We have to find...

295
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:13,745
...the sun.

296
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,748
Up there.

297
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:17,832
We need to...

298
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,584
...get above the canopy.

299
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:25,507
What was that?

300
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:29,594
Enough! Quiet! All of you!

301
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:33,306
We're being watched.

302
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,481
I can see a lake!

303
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:26,484
And a river.

304
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:29,821
And the Lonely Mountain.

305
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,073
We're almost there!

306
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:35,326
Can you hear me?

307
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:38,747
I know which way to go!

308
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,209
Hello?

309
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:53,762
Hello.

310
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:06,775
Oh, no.

311
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:07,859
Oh, come on.

312
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,711
Kill them! Kill them.

313
00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:52,005
Eat them now,
while their blood is running.

314
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:55,758
Their hide is tough,
but there's good juice inside.

315
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:56,634
Stick it again.

316
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:58,928
Stick it again. Finish it off.

317
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:01,806
The meat's alive and kicking!

318
00:28:02,056 --> 00:28:02,640
Kill him.

319
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:03,641
Kill him now.

320
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:05,476
Let us feast.

321
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:06,936
Feast! Feast!

322
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,272
Feast! Feast!

323
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:12,066
Eat them alive!

324
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:14,360
Feast!

325
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,577
What is it?
What is it?

326
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:26,664
Eat them alive!

327
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:32,045
Fat and juicy.

328
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:36,507
Just a...

329
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:37,842
...little taste.

330
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,855
Curse it! Where is it?! Where is it?!

331
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:53,358
Here.

332
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:56,235
Ah! It stings!

333
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:57,362
It stings!

334
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:04,619
Sting.

335
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:06,871
That's a good name.

336
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:09,791
Sting.

337
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:29,894
You all right there, Bofur?

338
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,479
I'm all right!
Get it off me!

339
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:32,814
Where's Bilbo?

340
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:34,023
I'm up here!

341
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:07,015
Grab the legs!

342
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:09,183
Pull!

343
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:12,186
Pull!

344
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:17,567
Where is it? Where is it? Come on.

345
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:19,444
Where is it?

346
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:42,341
No!

347
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:44,260
No! No!

348
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,471
Thorin! Get them!

349
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:47,638
Come on!

350
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:52,894
Look out, brother!

351
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:56,314
Fili!

352
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:21,422
Mine.

353
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:57,417
Come on...

354
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:58,835
...keep up!

355
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:00,711
We're clear!

356
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:24,026
Do not think I won't kill you, Dwarf.

357
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:25,945
It would be my pleasure.

358
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:32,243
- Help!
- Kili!

359
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:51,429
Throw me a dagger!

360
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:53,347
Quick!

361
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:54,682
If you think I'm giving you...

362
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:55,975
...a weapon, Dwarf...

363
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:57,310
...you're mistaken!

364
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:04,817
Search them.

365
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:12,450
B'ey! Give it back! That's private!

366
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,868
Who is this?

367
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:15,620
- Your brother?
- That is...

368
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,163
...my Wife!

369
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,499
And what is this horrid creature?

370
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,917
A Goblin-mutant?

371
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:23,085
That's my wee lad, Gimli.

372
00:33:30,306 --> 00:33:31,306
Are the Spiders dead?

373
00:33:31,707 --> 00:33:34,107
Yes, But more will come.

374
00:33:35,183 --> 00:33:37,218
They're growing bolder.

375
00:33:44,249 --> 00:33:47,223
This is an ancient Elvish blade.

376
00:33:49,124 --> 00:33:51,837
Forged by my kin.

377
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:56,327
Where did you get this?

378
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:57,954
It was given to me.

379
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:04,794
Not just a thief, but a liar as well.

380
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:11,092
Thorin, where's Bilbo?

381
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,023
Close the gate.

382
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:16,782
Unh! This is not the end of it!

383
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:20,328
- Do you hear me?!
- Hey, let us out of here!

384
00:35:20,578 --> 00:35:22,121
Get off me!

385
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:30,504
Aren't you going to search me?

386
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:34,342
I could have anything down my trousers.

387
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:36,761
Or nothing.

388
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:48,962
Why does the dwarf stare at you, Tauriel?

389
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:49,773
Who can say?

390
00:35:50,174 --> 00:35:53,574
He's quite tall for a Dwarf.

391
00:35:55,575 --> 00:35:58,075
- Do you not think?
- Taller than some...

392
00:35:59,546 --> 00:36:01,506
...but no less ugly.

393
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:13,005
- Ah! Again!
- Leave it!

394
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:15,591
There's no way out!

395
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:17,843
This is no Orc dungeon.

396
00:36:18,094 --> 00:36:20,596
These are the Halls
of the Woodland Realm.

397
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:24,684
No one leaves here
but by the king's consent.

398
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:32,900
Some may imagine
that a noble quest is at hand.

399
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:36,404
A quest to reclaim a homeland...

400
00:36:36,654 --> 00:36:38,406
...and slay a dragon.

401
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:43,786
I myself suspect a more prosaic motive.

402
00:36:44,662 --> 00:36:46,330
Attempted burglary.

403
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:49,333
Or something of that ilk.

404
00:36:52,503 --> 00:36:53,254
You have found...

405
00:36:53,504 --> 00:36:54,505
...a way in.

406
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:55,714
You seek that which would...

407
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:58,968
...bestow upon you the right to rule.

408
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:01,512
The King's Jewel.

409
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,931
The Arkenstone.

410
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:09,520
It is precious to you beyond measure.

411
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:12,231
I understand that.

412
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,819
There are gems in the mountain
that I too desire.

413
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:19,155
White gems...

414
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:21,449
...of pure starlight.

415
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:24,743
I offer you my help.

416
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:29,331
I am listening.

417
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:31,208
I will let you go...

418
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:34,879
...if you but return what is mine.

419
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,383
A favor for a favor.

420
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:40,593
You have my word.

421
00:37:42,011 --> 00:37:44,513
One king to another.

422
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:51,896
I would not trust Thranduil...

423
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:53,898
...the great king...

424
00:37:54,148 --> 00:37:55,316
...to honor his word...

425
00:37:55,566 --> 00:37:58,068
...should the end of all days
be upon us!

426
00:37:58,694 --> 00:37:59,278
You...

427
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:00,738
...who lack all...

428
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:01,989
...honor.

429
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:05,117
I have seen how you treat your friends.

430
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:09,413
We came to you once,
starving, homeless...

431
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:11,123
...seeking your help.

432
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:14,043
But you turned your back!

433
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:17,963
You turned away from
the suffering of my people...

434
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:20,174
...and the inferno that destroyed us.

435
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:23,010
May you die in dragon fire!

436
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:24,887
Do not talk to me of dragon fire.

437
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:25,930
I know...

438
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,432
...its wrath and ruin.

439
00:38:32,603 --> 00:38:33,812
I have faced...

440
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:36,816
...the great serpents of the North.

441
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:39,652
I warned your...

442
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:43,197
...grandfather of what his greed
would summon.

443
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,659
But he would not listen.

444
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:53,290
You are just like him.

445
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:57,503
Stay here if you will...

446
00:38:57,753 --> 00:38:59,296
...and rot.

447
00:38:59,547 --> 00:39:01,465
A hundred years is a mere blink...

448
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:03,717
...in the life of an Elf.

449
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:05,636
I'm patient.

450
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,681
I can wait.

451
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:17,231
Did he offer you a deal?

452
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:18,649
He did.

453
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:22,695
<i>I told him he could go
May you die in dragon fire!</i>

454
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:25,281
Him and all his kin!

455
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:29,076
Well, that's that, then.

456
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:33,289
A deal was our only hope.

457
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,460
Not our only hope.

458
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:46,760
I know you're there.

459
00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:51,557
Why do you linger in the shadows?

460
00:39:52,725 --> 00:39:54,935
I was coming to report to you.

461
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:59,481
I thought I ordered that nest
to be destroyed not two moons past.

462
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:00,399
We cleared...

463
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:03,110
...the forest as ordered, my lord.
But more spiders keep...

464
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,445
...coming up from the South.

465
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:05,321
They are spawning in...

466
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:07,823
...the ruins of Dol Guldur.
If we could kill them at their source...

467
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,284
That fortress lies beyond our borders.

468
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:13,329
Keep our lands clear of those
foul creatures. That is your task.

469
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:16,206
And when we drive them off, what then?

470
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:18,042
Will they not spread to other lands?

471
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,169
Other lands are not my concern.

472
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:23,213
The fortunes of the world...

473
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:24,548
...will rise and fall.

474
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:25,716
But here in this...

475
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:27,009
...kingdom, we will endure.

476
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:33,933
Legolas said you fought well today.

477
00:40:39,146 --> 00:40:41,023
He has grown very fond of you.

478
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,694
I assure you, my lord...

479
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,906
...Legolas thinks of me as
no more than a captain of the guard.

480
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:50,991
Perhaps he did once.

481
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:54,536
Now I am not so sure.

482
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:00,417
I do not think you would allow your son...

483
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:03,128
...to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan Elf.

484
00:41:03,379 --> 00:41:05,965
No, you are right. I would not.

485
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:09,009
Still, he cares about you.

486
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:12,346
Do not give him hope where there is none.

487
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:21,689
The gates are guarded.

488
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:24,882
Not all of them ... follow me!

489
00:41:50,718 --> 00:41:53,804
The stone in your hand, what is it?

490
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,766
It is a talisman.

491
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:02,604
A powerful spell lies upon it.

492
00:42:02,855 --> 00:42:05,566
If any but a
reads the runes on this stone...

493
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,651
...they will be forever cursed.

494
00:42:13,991 --> 00:42:14,658
Or not.

495
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,538
Depending on whether you believe
in that kind of thing. It's just a token.

496
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:23,792
A rune stone.

497
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:26,545
My mother...

498
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:28,714
...gave it to me
so I'd remember my promise.

499
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:31,842
What promise?

500
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:33,719
That I would come back to her.

501
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:37,890
She worries.

502
00:42:39,308 --> 00:42:40,893
She thinks I'm reckless.

503
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:42,728
Are you?

504
00:42:44,563 --> 00:42:45,397
Nah.

505
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:58,243
Sounds like quite a party...

506
00:42:58,494 --> 00:42:59,870
...you're having up there.

507
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:02,539
<i>It is Mereth en Gilith...</i>

508
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:05,000
...the Feast of Starlight.

509
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:08,629
All light is sacred to the Eldar.

510
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:12,674
But Wood Elves love best
the light of the stars.

511
00:43:13,342 --> 00:43:14,843
I always thought it is a cold light.

512
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:19,223
Remote and far away.

513
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:22,309
It is memory...

514
00:43:23,352 --> 00:43:25,229
...precious and pure.

515
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,235
Like your promise.

516
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:42,538
I have walked there sometimes.

517
00:43:43,664 --> 00:43:44,456
Beyond the forest...

518
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:46,250
...and up into the night.

519
00:43:47,835 --> 00:43:50,838
I have seen the world fall away...

520
00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:54,883
...and the white light of forever fill the air.

521
00:43:58,262 --> 00:44:00,138
I saw a fire moon once.

522
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:04,726
It rose over the pass near Dunland. Huge.

523
00:44:05,102 --> 00:44:07,563
Red and gold, it was. It filled the sky.

524
00:44:09,398 --> 00:44:12,359
We were an escort for some merchants
from Ered Luin. They were...

525
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:15,737
...trading in silverwork for furs.
We took the Greenway south...

526
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:18,282
...keeping the mountain to our left.

527
00:44:18,657 --> 00:44:20,242
And then it appeared.

528
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:22,494
This huge fire moon...

529
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:24,580
...lighting our path.

530
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:27,124
I wish I could show you the caverns.

531
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:31,044
Galion, you old rogue,
we're running out of drink.

532
00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:34,673
These empty barrels should have been
sent back to Esgaroth hours ago.

533
00:44:34,923 --> 00:44:36,967
The bargeman will be waiting for them.

534
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:38,302
Say what you like about our...

535
00:44:38,552 --> 00:44:41,889
...ill-tempered king.
He has excellent taste in wine.

536
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:44,391
Come, Elros, try it.

537
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:45,934
I have the Dwarves...

538
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,186
...in my charge.

539
00:44:47,603 --> 00:44:50,522
They're locked up. Where can they go? Ha, ha.

540
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:56,153
I'll wager the sun is on the rise.

541
00:44:56,403 --> 00:44:58,113
Must be nearly dawn.

542
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:00,657
We're never gonna reach
the mountain, are we?

543
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:05,704
Not stuck in here, you're not.

544
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:12,294
Bilbo!

545
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:13,420
What?

546
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:17,925
Shh! There are guards nearby!

547
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,598
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Close the doors.

548
00:45:24,848 --> 00:45:27,017
- It'll buy us more time.
- All right, Nori.

549
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:39,321
Up the stairs.
You first.

550
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:40,155
Ori.

551
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:41,823
Not that way. Down here. Follow me.

552
00:45:43,242 --> 00:45:44,076
Go.

553
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:45,827
Easy, now.

554
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:02,010
This way.

555
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:05,889
Come on.

556
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:07,724
I don't believe it. We're in the cellars!

557
00:46:07,975 --> 00:46:09,726
You were supposed to be leading us out,
not further in!

558
00:46:09,977 --> 00:46:10,686
I know what I'm doing!

559
00:46:10,936 --> 00:46:11,770
Shh!

560
00:46:12,312 --> 00:46:13,897
This way! This way!

561
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:19,528
Everyone...

562
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:22,030
- ...climb into the barrels quickly.
- Are you mad?

563
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:23,907
- They'll find us.
No, no.

564
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:25,200
They won't, I promise you.

565
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:28,954
Please, please. You must trust me.

566
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:33,917
Do as he says.

567
00:46:35,043 --> 00:46:36,128
Move your big ginger head.

568
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:39,047
Bifur, get in...

569
00:46:39,298 --> 00:46:41,216
...the barrel! Move!

570
00:46:47,973 --> 00:46:49,599
Everyone's in.

571
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:54,646
What do we do now?

572
00:46:55,397 --> 00:46:56,398
Hold your breath.

573
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:57,524
Hold my breath? What do you mean?

574
00:47:24,301 --> 00:47:25,844
Where is the Keeper of the Keys?

575
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:54,206
Well done, Master Baggins.

576
00:47:55,749 --> 00:47:56,917
Go! Come on, let's go!

577
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:08,553
Hold on!

578
00:48:21,775 --> 00:48:23,110
Bilbo!

579
00:48:27,697 --> 00:48:28,949
Hang on!

580
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:32,869
- Help!
- Ori!

581
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:38,870
Shut the gate!

582
00:48:57,602 --> 00:48:58,186
No!

583
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,702
Watch out! There's Ores!

584
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:32,743
Slay them all!

585
00:49:33,597 --> 00:49:34,181
Get under the bridge!

586
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:47,944
Kili!

587
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:13,929
Kili!

588
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:21,603
Kili.

589
00:50:36,445 --> 00:50:39,414
Kill her! Kill the She-Elf!

590
00:51:07,115 --> 00:51:08,615
After them!

591
00:51:15,699 --> 00:51:16,366
Kili!

592
00:52:40,617 --> 00:52:41,743
Nori!

593
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:55,632
Cut the log!

594
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:04,599
Bombur!

595
00:54:40,195 --> 00:54:42,189
Tauriel.
Wait!

596
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:47,890
This one we keep alive.

597
00:54:48,787 --> 00:54:52,859
After them! Cut them off!

598
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:40,064
Oh, it's you!

599
00:56:40,523 --> 00:56:41,899
Why am I here, Gandalf?

600
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:43,359
Trust me, Radagast.

601
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:46,571
I would not have called you here
without good reason.

602
00:56:51,117 --> 00:56:53,661
This is not a nice place to meet.

603
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,038
No.

604
00:56:55,997 --> 00:56:57,457
It is not.

605
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:01,085
These are dark spells, Gandalf.

606
00:57:01,336 --> 00:57:04,047
Old and full of hate.

607
00:57:04,297 --> 00:57:05,632
Who's buried here?

608
00:57:06,007 --> 00:57:09,344
If he had a name,
it's long since been lost.

609
00:57:09,594 --> 00:57:11,679
He would have been known only...

610
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:14,223
...as a servant of evil.

611
00:57:16,726 --> 00:57:18,770
One of a number.

612
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:24,817
One of nine.

613
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,989
Why now, Gandalf? I don't understand.

614
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:30,823
The Ringwraiths...

615
00:57:31,074 --> 00:57:32,867
...have been summoned to Dol Guldur.

616
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:35,078
But it cannot be the Necromancer.

617
00:57:35,328 --> 00:57:38,831
A human sorcerer
could not summon such evil.

618
00:57:39,082 --> 00:57:41,042
Who said it was human?

619
00:57:42,794 --> 00:57:46,339
The Nine only answer to one master.

620
00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:49,175
We've been blind, Radagast.

621
00:57:49,425 --> 00:57:51,511
And in our blindness...

622
00:57:51,761 --> 00:57:53,888
...the Enemy has returned.

623
00:57:56,349 --> 00:57:58,518
He is summoning his servants.

624
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:00,895
Azog the Defiler...

625
00:58:01,312 --> 00:58:03,147
...is no ordinary hunter.

626
00:58:03,398 --> 00:58:04,732
He is a commander.

627
00:58:05,441 --> 00:58:07,527
A commander of legions.

628
00:58:08,069 --> 00:58:11,948
The Enemy is preparing for war.

629
00:58:12,657 --> 00:58:14,325
It will begin in the East.

630
00:58:14,784 --> 00:58:17,370
His mind is set upon that mountain.

631
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,455
- Where are you going?
- To rejoin the others.

632
00:58:19,706 --> 00:58:20,665
Gandalf.

633
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:24,585
I started this. I cannot forsake them.

634
00:58:24,836 --> 00:58:26,754
They are in grave danger.

635
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:28,256
If what you say is true...

636
00:58:28,506 --> 00:58:31,217
...the world is in grave danger.

637
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:35,930
The power in that fortress
will only grow stronger.

638
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:40,351
You want me to cast my friends aside?

639
00:58:43,354 --> 00:58:45,690
Anything behind us?
Not that I can see.

640
00:58:50,862 --> 00:58:53,698
- I think we've outrun the Ores.
- Not for long. We've lost the current.

641
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:56,117
Bombur's half drowned.

642
00:58:56,701 --> 00:58:58,453
- Make for the shore!
- Aye.

643
00:58:58,703 --> 00:58:59,620
Come on, let's go!

644
00:58:59,871 --> 00:59:01,664
Gloin, help me, my brother.

645
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,877
Come on, lift yourself.

646
00:59:06,377 --> 00:59:07,462
Come on!

647
00:59:07,712 --> 00:59:10,173
Come on, you big lump, you!

648
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:21,976
I'm fine. It's nothing.

649
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:23,144
On your feet.

650
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:25,438
Kilt's wounded. His leg needs binding.

651
00:59:25,688 --> 00:59:28,066
There's an Orc pack on our tail.
We keep moving.

652
00:59:28,316 --> 00:59:29,233
To where?

653
00:59:29,484 --> 00:59:31,402
To the mountain. We're so close.

654
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:34,864
A lake lies between us and that mountain.

655
00:59:35,114 --> 00:59:37,408
- We have no way to cross it.
- So then we go around.

656
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:40,620
The Orcs will run us down,
as sure as daylight.

657
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:42,955
We've no weapons to defend ourselves.

658
00:59:43,206 --> 00:59:44,874
Bind his leg, quickly.

659
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:46,959
You have two minutes.

660
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:08,189
Do it again...

661
01:00:08,981 --> 01:00:10,066
...and you're dead.

662
01:00:12,777 --> 01:00:13,986
Excuse me...

663
01:00:14,237 --> 01:00:17,365
...but you're from Lake-town,
if I'm not mistaken.

664
01:00:18,324 --> 01:00:20,827
That barge over there...

665
01:00:21,077 --> 01:00:24,372
...it wouldn't be available for hire,
by any chance?

666
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,125
What makes you think I would help you?

667
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:30,211
Those boots have seen better days.

668
01:00:30,795 --> 01:00:32,338
As has that coat.

669
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:35,383
No doubt you have
some hungry mouths to feed.

670
01:00:36,509 --> 01:00:37,927
How many bairns?

671
01:00:38,845 --> 01:00:40,471
A boy and two girls.

672
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:44,016
And your wife, I imagine she's a beauty.

673
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:46,394
Aye.

674
01:00:46,853 --> 01:00:47,895
She was.

675
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:52,650
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

676
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,735
Oh, come on, come on.
Enough of the niceties.

677
01:00:56,445 --> 01:00:57,572
What's your hurry?

678
01:00:57,822 --> 01:00:59,031
What's it to you?

679
01:00:59,365 --> 01:01:00,950
I would like to know who you are...

680
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:03,286
...and what you are doing in these lands.

681
01:01:03,953 --> 01:01:06,455
We are simple merchants
from the Blue Mountains...

682
01:01:06,831 --> 01:01:08,291
...journeying to see our kin...

683
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:10,126
...in the Iron Hills.

684
01:01:11,502 --> 01:01:13,462
Simple merchants, you say?

685
01:01:13,713 --> 01:01:15,047
We need food...

686
01:01:15,298 --> 01:01:17,258
...supplies, weapons.

687
01:01:17,508 --> 01:01:18,676
Can you help us?

688
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:23,848
I know where these...

689
01:01:24,098 --> 01:01:25,474
...barrels came from.

690
01:01:26,225 --> 01:01:27,476
What of it'?

691
01:01:27,727 --> 01:01:30,146
I don't know what business you had
with the Elves...

692
01:01:30,688 --> 01:01:32,398
...but I don't think it ended well.

693
01:01:34,066 --> 01:01:34,734
No one enters Lake-town...

694
01:01:34,984 --> 01:01:36,944
...but by leave of the Master.

695
01:01:37,653 --> 01:01:40,364
All his wealth comes from trade
with the Woodland Realm.

696
01:01:40,615 --> 01:01:43,409
He would see you in irons before
risking the wrath of King Thranduil.

697
01:01:45,328 --> 01:01:46,287
Offer him more.

698
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:49,874
I'll wager there are...

699
01:01:50,124 --> 01:01:52,043
...ways to enter that town unseen.

700
01:01:52,919 --> 01:01:54,003
Aye.

701
01:01:55,338 --> 01:01:56,589
But for that...

702
01:01:57,798 --> 01:01:59,175
...you would need a smuggler.

703
01:01:59,425 --> 01:02:01,344
For which we would pay double.

704
01:02:09,894 --> 01:02:13,522
<i>Such is the nature of evil.
Out there in...</i>

705
01:02:13,773 --> 01:02:15,358
...the vast ignorance of the world...

706
01:02:15,608 --> 01:02:17,902
...it festers and spreads.

707
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:20,863
A shadow that grows in the dark.

708
01:02:21,489 --> 01:02:23,199
A sleepless malice as black...

709
01:02:23,449 --> 01:02:26,369
...as the oncoming wall of night.

710
01:02:27,578 --> 01:02:29,246
So it ever was.

711
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:32,041
So will it always be.

712
01:02:33,334 --> 01:02:37,004
In time, all foul things come forth.

713
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:40,174
You were tracking a company of 13 Dwarves.

714
01:02:40,424 --> 01:02:41,384
Why?

715
01:02:41,634 --> 01:02:42,969
Not 13.

716
01:02:43,386 --> 01:02:44,762
Not anymore.

717
01:02:45,471 --> 01:02:46,389
The young one...

718
01:02:47,056 --> 01:02:48,975
...the black-haired archer...

719
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:51,435
...we stuck him with a Morgul shaft.

720
01:02:53,104 --> 01:02:56,232
The poison's in his blood. He'll be...

721
01:02:56,482 --> 01:02:57,525
...choking on it soon.

722
01:02:58,317 --> 01:03:00,111
Answer the question, filth.

723
01:03:00,302 --> 01:03:03,272
I do not answer to dogs, She-Elf!

724
01:03:05,533 --> 01:03:07,243
I would not antagonize her.

725
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:09,620
You like killing things, Orc?

726
01:03:10,955 --> 01:03:12,331
You like death?

727
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:14,375
Then let me give it to you.

728
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:16,252
enough!

729
01:03:16,653 --> 01:03:18,753
Tauriel, leave!

730
01:03:19,014 --> 01:03:20,254
Now go.

731
01:03:30,725 --> 01:03:32,184
I do not care about one...

732
01:03:32,435 --> 01:03:35,104
...dead . Answer the question.

733
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:38,691
You have nothing to fear. Tell us...

734
01:03:38,941 --> 01:03:41,444
...what you know
and I will set you free.

735
01:03:41,986 --> 01:03:44,405
You had orders to kill them. Why?

736
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:46,824
What is Thorin Oakenshield to you?

737
01:03:47,074 --> 01:03:49,952
The  runt will never be king.

738
01:03:50,202 --> 01:03:51,120
King?

739
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:54,415
There is no King Under the Mountain,
nor will there ever be.

740
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:56,959
None would dare enter Erebor...

741
01:03:57,209 --> 01:03:58,210
...whilst the dragon lives.

742
01:03:58,461 --> 01:04:00,129
You know nothing.

743
01:04:00,379 --> 01:04:03,007
Your world will burn.

744
01:04:03,257 --> 01:04:04,884
What are you talking about?

745
01:04:05,384 --> 01:04:06,594
Speak!

746
01:04:07,053 --> 01:04:09,847
Our time has come again.

747
01:04:10,473 --> 01:04:13,768
My master serves the One.

748
01:04:15,227 --> 01:04:17,688
Do you understand now, Elfling?

749
01:04:17,938 --> 01:04:19,774
Death is upon you.

750
01:04:20,024 --> 01:04:22,234
The flames of war...

751
01:04:22,485 --> 01:04:24,111
...are upon you.

752
01:04:27,198 --> 01:04:28,240
Why did you do that?

753
01:04:28,741 --> 01:04:30,576
You promised to set him free.

754
01:04:30,826 --> 01:04:31,952
And I did.

755
01:04:32,995 --> 01:04:36,248
I freed his wretched head
from his miserable shoulders.

756
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:38,417
There was more...

757
01:04:38,667 --> 01:04:40,419
...the Orc could tell us.

758
01:04:40,836 --> 01:04:43,130
There was nothing more he could tell me.

759
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:46,550
What did he mean by "the flames of war"?

760
01:04:47,218 --> 01:04:49,512
It means they intend to
unleash a weapon so great...

761
01:04:49,762 --> 01:04:51,931
...it will destroy all before it.

762
01:04:52,681 --> 01:04:55,976
I want the watch doubled at our borders.
All roads, all rivers.

763
01:04:56,227 --> 01:04:57,978
Nothing moves, but I hear of it.

764
01:04:58,229 --> 01:04:59,772
No one enters this kingdom.

765
01:05:00,898 --> 01:05:02,441
And no one leaves it.

766
01:05:05,861 --> 01:05:07,363
Close the gate!

767
01:05:07,374 --> 01:05:10,764
Keep it sealed by order of the King.

768
01:05:11,617 --> 01:05:12,743
What about Tauriel?

769
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,974
What about her?

770
01:05:17,164 --> 01:05:18,632
She went into the forest...

771
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:21,233
...armed with her bow and blade.

772
01:05:21,634 --> 01:05:22,874
She has not returned.

773
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:48,475
blood!

774
01:05:48,956 --> 01:05:50,476
They were here!

775
01:05:50,877 --> 01:05:53,777
There is another scent ...

776
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:59,293
Man flesh!

777
01:06:03,294 --> 01:06:08,500
They have found a way to cross the lake.

778
01:06:27,902 --> 01:06:28,485
Watch out!

779
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:38,287
What are you trying...

780
01:06:38,537 --> 01:06:40,206
...to do, drown us?

781
01:06:40,456 --> 01:06:43,042
I was born and bred on these waters,
Master .

782
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:44,668
If I wanted to drown you...

783
01:06:44,919 --> 01:06:46,504
...I would not do it here.

784
01:06:48,589 --> 01:06:51,008
Oh, I've had enough of this lippy Lakeman.

785
01:06:51,258 --> 01:06:54,011
I say we throw him over the side
and be done with it.

786
01:06:54,261 --> 01:06:56,722
- Bard, his name's Bard.
- How do you know?

787
01:06:57,306 --> 01:06:58,724
Uh, I asked him.

788
01:06:58,974 --> 01:07:01,560
I don't care what he calls himself.
I don't like him.

789
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,354
We do not have to like him.

790
01:07:03,604 --> 01:07:05,231
We simply have to pay him.

791
01:07:05,564 --> 01:07:07,274
Come on now, lads. Turn out...

792
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:08,484
...your pockets.

793
01:07:09,735 --> 01:07:11,320
How do we know he won't betray us?

794
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:12,780
We don't.

795
01:07:13,739 --> 01:07:14,323
There's...

796
01:07:14,865 --> 01:07:15,824
...just a wee problem.

797
01:07:17,076 --> 01:07:18,494
We're 10 coins short.

798
01:07:20,663 --> 01:07:21,330
Gloin.

799
01:07:22,957 --> 01:07:23,541
Come on.

800
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:25,918
- Give us what you have.
- Don't look to me.

801
01:07:27,002 --> 01:07:29,338
I have been bled dry...

802
01:07:29,588 --> 01:07:30,673
...by this venture.

803
01:07:31,006 --> 01:07:31,966
What have I seen...

804
01:07:32,216 --> 01:07:33,509
...for my investment?

805
01:07:34,343 --> 01:07:36,095
Naught but misery and...

806
01:07:36,345 --> 01:07:37,221
...grief and...

807
01:07:45,604 --> 01:07:47,564
Bless my beard.

808
01:07:48,399 --> 01:07:49,567
Take it.

809
01:07:50,693 --> 01:07:52,069
- Take all of it.
- Ahem.

810
01:07:55,906 --> 01:07:57,032
The money, quick. Give it to me.

811
01:07:57,283 --> 01:07:57,992
We will pay you when we...

812
01:07:58,242 --> 01:07:59,952
...get our provisions but not before.

813
01:08:00,202 --> 01:08:02,663
If you value your freedom,
you'll do as I say.

814
01:08:03,122 --> 01:08:04,373
There are guards ahead.

815
01:08:22,933 --> 01:08:24,310
What's he doing?

816
01:08:24,685 --> 01:08:25,853
He's talking to someone.

817
01:08:28,522 --> 01:08:29,607
He's pointing right at us.

818
01:08:32,985 --> 01:08:33,569
Now they're...

819
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:34,403
...shaking hands.

820
01:08:34,653 --> 01:08:36,113
- What?
- The villain.

821
01:08:36,363 --> 01:08:37,656
He's selling us out.

822
01:09:00,679 --> 01:09:01,597
Quiet.

823
01:09:04,391 --> 01:09:06,101
We're approaching the tollgate.

824
01:09:17,488 --> 01:09:18,322
Halt!

825
01:09:18,614 --> 01:09:19,948
Goods inspection!

826
01:09:20,699 --> 01:09:22,534
Papers, please!

827
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,536
Oh, it's you, Bard.

828
01:09:24,787 --> 01:09:25,829
Morning, Percy.

829
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,289
Anything to declare?

830
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:30,292
Nothing, but that I am cold and tired...

831
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:31,585
...and ready for home.

832
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:33,087
You and me both.

833
01:09:37,174 --> 01:09:38,592
There we are.

834
01:09:38,842 --> 01:09:39,677
All in order.

835
01:09:39,927 --> 01:09:42,763
Not so fast.

836
01:09:43,972 --> 01:09:47,226
"Consignment of empty barrels
from the Woodland Realm. "

837
01:09:48,727 --> 01:09:49,436
Only...

838
01:09:51,605 --> 01:09:53,232
...they're not empty...

839
01:09:54,066 --> 01:09:55,275
...are they, Bard?

840
01:09:55,526 --> 01:09:56,485
If I recall correctly...

841
01:09:56,735 --> 01:09:59,029
...you're licensed as a bargeman.

842
01:09:59,988 --> 01:10:00,906
Not...

843
01:10:02,449 --> 01:10:03,659
...a fisherman.

844
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:05,411
That's none of your business.

845
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,079
Wrong.

846
01:10:07,329 --> 01:10:10,749
It's the Master's business,
which makes it my business.

847
01:10:10,999 --> 01:10:13,544
Oh, come on, Alfrid, have a heart.
People need to eat.

848
01:10:13,794 --> 01:10:16,046
These fish are illegal.

849
01:10:16,797 --> 01:10:17,423
Empty the barrels...

850
01:10:17,673 --> 01:10:19,883
- ... over the side.
- You heard him. In the canal.

851
01:10:21,969 --> 01:10:23,929
Come on. Get a move on.

852
01:10:24,179 --> 01:10:25,973
Folk in this town are struggling.

853
01:10:26,598 --> 01:10:27,724
Times are hard.

854
01:10:27,975 --> 01:10:28,934
Food is scarce.

855
01:10:29,184 --> 01:10:30,310
That's not my problem.

856
01:10:30,644 --> 01:10:32,604
And when the people hear
the Master is dumping fish...

857
01:10:32,855 --> 01:10:34,440
...back in the lake...

858
01:10:34,982 --> 01:10:36,567
...when the rioting starts...

859
01:10:39,403 --> 01:10:40,737
...will it be your problem then?

860
01:10:45,743 --> 01:10:46,827
Stop.

861
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:51,331
Ever the people's champion...

862
01:10:51,582 --> 01:10:53,667
...eh, Bard? Protector of...

863
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:54,710
...the common folk.

864
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,420
You might have their favor now,
bargeman...

865
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:57,629
...but it won't last.

866
01:11:01,842 --> 01:11:02,968
Raise the gate!

867
01:11:06,096 --> 01:11:07,973
The Master has his eye on you.

868
01:11:08,223 --> 01:11:09,725
You'd do well to remember:

869
01:11:09,975 --> 01:11:11,518
We know where you live.

870
01:11:11,769 --> 01:11:13,437
It's a small town, Alfrid.

871
01:11:14,062 --> 01:11:16,190
Everyone knows where everyone lives.

872
01:11:32,372 --> 01:11:34,666
All this talk of civil unrest.

873
01:11:34,917 --> 01:11:36,585
Someone's been stirring the pot, sire.

874
01:11:40,088 --> 01:11:41,215
Gout playing up, sire?

875
01:11:41,465 --> 01:11:42,424
It's the damp.

876
01:11:42,674 --> 01:11:43,634
It's the only possible explanation.

877
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:45,511
Get me a brandy.

878
01:11:46,386 --> 01:11:49,181
The mood of the people, sire,
it's turning ugly.

879
01:11:49,431 --> 01:11:52,392
They're commoners, Alfrid.
They've always been ugly.

880
01:11:52,643 --> 01:11:54,186
It's not my fault they live in a place...

881
01:11:54,436 --> 01:11:57,147
...that stinks of fish oil and tar.

882
01:11:57,856 --> 01:12:00,817
Jobs, shelter, food.

883
01:12:01,068 --> 01:12:02,694
It's all they ever bleat about.

884
01:12:02,945 --> 01:12:06,573
It's my belief, sire, they are
being led on by troublemakers.

885
01:12:07,908 --> 01:12:09,284
Then we must find these...

886
01:12:09,535 --> 01:12:11,453
...troublemakers and arrest them.

887
01:12:11,703 --> 01:12:13,622
My thoughts exactly, sire.

888
01:12:13,872 --> 01:12:16,708
And all this talk of change
must be suppressed.

889
01:12:16,959 --> 01:12:19,253
Can't afford to let the rabble
band together...

890
01:12:19,503 --> 01:12:21,171
...and start making noises.
The next thing...

891
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:24,341
...you know, they'll start
asking questions...

892
01:12:24,591 --> 01:12:26,176
...forming committees...

893
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,595
...launching inquiries.

894
01:12:28,846 --> 01:12:31,306
Out with the old, in with the new?

895
01:12:32,015 --> 01:12:32,975
What?

896
01:12:33,225 --> 01:12:35,269
That's what they've been saying, sire.

897
01:12:35,519 --> 01:12:36,478
There is even talk...

898
01:12:36,728 --> 01:12:37,938
...of an election.

899
01:12:38,188 --> 01:12:39,398
An election? Heh.

900
01:12:39,648 --> 01:12:40,941
That's absurd.

901
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:43,193
I won't stand for it. Ha!

902
01:12:43,986 --> 01:12:46,238
I don't think they'd ask you to stand, sire.

903
01:12:48,115 --> 01:12:49,658
Shirkers.

904
01:12:49,908 --> 01:12:50,826
Ingrates.

905
01:12:51,076 --> 01:12:52,119
Rabble-rousers.

906
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:55,080
Who would have the nerve
to question my authority?

907
01:12:55,622 --> 01:12:56,999
Who would dare?

908
01:12:57,249 --> 01:12:58,250
Who-?

909
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:04,506
Bard.

910
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:06,925
You mark my words:

911
01:13:07,175 --> 01:13:08,802
<i>That trouble-making bargeman...</i>

912
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:10,804
<i>...is behind all this.</i>

913
01:13:17,936 --> 01:13:19,021
Get your hands off me.

914
01:13:26,528 --> 01:13:28,196
You didn't see them.
They were never here.

915
01:13:30,073 --> 01:13:31,658
The fish you can have for nothing.

916
01:13:34,453 --> 01:13:35,787
Follow me.

917
01:13:44,838 --> 01:13:45,922
Da!

918
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:48,216
Our house, it's being watched.

919
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:25,962
You can tell the Master
I'm done...

920
01:14:26,213 --> 01:14:26,838
...for the day.

921
01:14:28,131 --> 01:14:30,676
Da! Where have you been?

922
01:14:30,926 --> 01:14:33,887
Father! There you are! I was worried.

923
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:35,639
Here, Sigrid.

924
01:14:36,223 --> 01:14:37,182
Bain, get them in.

925
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:47,526
If you speak of this to anyone...

926
01:14:47,776 --> 01:14:49,236
...I'll rip your arms off.

927
01:14:52,114 --> 01:14:53,573
Get off.

928
01:14:55,033 --> 01:14:56,118
Up there.

929
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:04,668
Da...

930
01:15:04,918 --> 01:15:07,170
...why are there Dwarves
climbing out of our toilet?

931
01:15:07,421 --> 01:15:08,755
Will they bring us luck?

932
01:15:13,343 --> 01:15:14,177
They may not be the best fit...

933
01:15:14,428 --> 01:15:16,179
...but they'll keep you warm.

934
01:15:16,847 --> 01:15:17,889
Thank you very much.

935
01:15:28,108 --> 01:15:30,193
A Dwarvish windlance.

936
01:15:30,485 --> 01:15:31,069
You look like...

937
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:32,612
...you've seen a ghost.

938
01:15:33,363 --> 01:15:34,531
He has.

939
01:15:35,323 --> 01:15:36,324
The last time we saw...

940
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:38,243
...such a weapon...

941
01:15:39,286 --> 01:15:40,162
...a city was on fire.

942
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:44,458
It was the day the dragon came.

943
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:49,171
<i>The day that Smaug...</i>

944
01:15:49,421 --> 01:15:50,547
<i>...destroyed Dale.</i>

945
01:15:53,008 --> 01:15:55,218
<i>Girion, the Lord of the City...</i>

946
01:15:55,469 --> 01:15:56,219
...rallied his bowmen...

947
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:57,596
<i>...to fire upon the beast.</i>

948
01:15:58,722 --> 01:16:00,474
But a dragon's hide is tough.

949
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:03,226
Tougher than the strongest armor.

950
01:16:03,477 --> 01:16:06,646
Only a Black Arrow fired from a windlance...

951
01:16:06,897 --> 01:16:08,482
...could have pierced the dragon's hide.

952
01:16:09,441 --> 01:16:10,484
<i>And few of those...</i>

953
01:16:10,734 --> 01:16:12,527
<i>...arrows were ever made.</i>

954
01:16:17,866 --> 01:16:18,992
<i>The store was running low...</i>

955
01:16:19,493 --> 01:16:20,077
<i>...when Girion...</i>

956
01:16:20,327 --> 01:16:20,911
<i>...made his last stand.</i>

957
01:16:29,294 --> 01:16:32,714
Had the aim of Men been true that day...

958
01:16:33,298 --> 01:16:35,133
...much would have been different.

959
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:41,181
You speak as if you were there.

960
01:16:42,557 --> 01:16:44,643
All Dwarves know the tale.

961
01:16:44,976 --> 01:16:47,187
Then you would know
that Girion hit the dragon.

962
01:16:47,437 --> 01:16:49,314
He loosened a scale under the left wing.

963
01:16:49,564 --> 01:16:50,816
One more shot and
he would have killed the beast.

964
01:16:52,776 --> 01:16:54,653
That's a fairy story, lad.

965
01:16:54,903 --> 01:16:56,279
Nothing more.

966
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,657
You took our money.

967
01:16:59,741 --> 01:17:01,034
Where are the weapons?

968
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:04,830
Wait here.

969
01:17:19,302 --> 01:17:20,011
Tomorrow begins...

970
01:17:20,262 --> 01:17:21,263
...the last days of autumn.

971
01:17:21,513 --> 01:17:23,765
Durin's Day falls the morn after next.

972
01:17:24,015 --> 01:17:25,934
We must reach the mountain before then.

973
01:17:26,184 --> 01:17:27,519
And if we do not?

974
01:17:27,769 --> 01:17:30,105
If we fail to find the hidden door
before that time?

975
01:17:30,355 --> 01:17:31,648
Then this quest has been for nothing.

976
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,370
What is this?

977
01:17:45,954 --> 01:17:47,205
Pike hook.

978
01:17:47,455 --> 01:17:48,623
Made from an old harpoon.

979
01:17:49,207 --> 01:17:51,376
- And this?
- A crowbill, we call it.

980
01:17:51,626 --> 01:17:53,170
Fashioned from a smithy's hammer.

981
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:54,921
It's heavy in hand, I grant...

982
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:57,924
...but in defense of your life,
these will serve you better than none.

983
01:17:58,174 --> 01:17:58,925
We paid...

984
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:00,886
...you for weapons.

985
01:18:01,136 --> 01:18:02,679
Iron-forged swords...

986
01:18:02,929 --> 01:18:03,930
...and axes!

987
01:18:04,181 --> 01:18:05,140
It's a joke!

988
01:18:07,267 --> 01:18:07,934
You won't find...

989
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:09,811
...better outside the city armory.

990
01:18:10,061 --> 01:18:11,438
All iron-forged weapons are held there...

991
01:18:11,688 --> 01:18:12,898
...under lock and key.

992
01:18:13,148 --> 01:18:14,190
Thorin...

993
01:18:14,816 --> 01:18:15,525
...why not take what's...

994
01:18:15,775 --> 01:18:16,693
...on offer and go?

995
01:18:16,943 --> 01:18:18,153
I've made do with less.

996
01:18:18,403 --> 01:18:19,196
So have you.

997
01:18:21,531 --> 01:18:23,700
- I say we leave now.
- You're not going anywhere.

998
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:24,868
What did you say?

999
01:18:25,118 --> 01:18:26,369
There are spies watching this house...

1000
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:29,289
...and probably every dock
and wharf in the town.

1001
01:18:29,915 --> 01:18:30,540
You must wait...

1002
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:31,708
...till nightfall.

1003
01:18:48,183 --> 01:18:49,351
Thorin.

1004
01:19:02,364 --> 01:19:03,490
Da?

1005
01:19:06,701 --> 01:19:08,119
Don't let them leave.

1006
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,120
I thought you were an Orc.

1007
01:19:35,641 --> 01:19:37,321
If I were an orc ...

1008
01:19:37,722 --> 01:19:39,022
... you would be dead.

1009
01:19:40,277 --> 01:19:41,277
Tauriel...

1010
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:44,114
...you cannot hunt 30 Orcs...

1011
01:19:44,364 --> 01:19:45,240
...on your own.

1012
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:47,367
But I'm not on my own.

1013
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:49,494
You knew I would come.

1014
01:19:52,122 --> 01:19:52,956
The king is angry...

1015
01:19:53,206 --> 01:19:55,000
...Tauriel. For 600 years...

1016
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:56,960
...my father has protected you,
favored you.

1017
01:19:58,086 --> 01:19:59,462
You defied his orders.

1018
01:19:59,713 --> 01:20:01,089
You betrayed his trust.

1019
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,293
Come back with me ...

1020
01:20:04,394 --> 01:20:06,294
... he will forgive you.

1021
01:20:06,335 --> 01:20:07,425
But I will not.

1022
01:20:07,726 --> 01:20:10,426
If I go back, I will not forgive myself.

1023
01:20:11,099 --> 01:20:12,642
The king has never let Orc filth...

1024
01:20:12,892 --> 01:20:13,852
...roam our lands.

1025
01:20:14,102 --> 01:20:17,397
Yet he would let this Orc pack cross
our borders and kill our prisoners.

1026
01:20:17,647 --> 01:20:18,940
It is not our fight.

1027
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:20,692
It is our fight.

1028
01:20:21,234 --> 01:20:22,944
It will not end here.

1029
01:20:23,194 --> 01:20:26,072
With every victory, this evil will grow.

1030
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:29,075
If your father has his way,
we will do nothing.

1031
01:20:29,326 --> 01:20:31,411
We will hide within our walls...

1032
01:20:31,661 --> 01:20:33,997
...live our lives away from the light...

1033
01:20:34,247 --> 01:20:35,790
...and let darkness descend.

1034
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:39,544
Are we not part of this world?

1035
01:20:40,754 --> 01:20:41,921
Tell me, mellon.
(Friend)

1036
01:20:42,172 --> 01:20:45,675
When did we let evil
become stronger than us?

1037
01:20:50,555 --> 01:20:53,266
Hello, Bard. What you after?

1038
01:20:54,309 --> 01:20:55,852
There was a tapestry!

1039
01:20:56,561 --> 01:20:58,688
An old one! Where's it gone?

1040
01:20:58,938 --> 01:20:59,606
What tapestry you talking about?

1041
01:21:00,482 --> 01:21:01,066
This one.

1042
01:21:02,067 --> 01:21:03,651
They were Dwarves, I tell you.
Appeared...

1043
01:21:03,902 --> 01:21:04,736
...out of nowhere.

1044
01:21:04,986 --> 01:21:07,155
Full beards. Fierce eyes.

1045
01:21:07,405 --> 01:21:09,032
I've never seen the like.

1046
01:21:09,282 --> 01:21:11,368
What are Dwarves doing in these parts?

1047
01:21:11,618 --> 01:21:13,078
- It's the prophecy.
- The prophecy?

1048
01:21:13,453 --> 01:21:15,246
The Prophecy of Durin's Folk.

1049
01:21:24,672 --> 01:21:26,091
Prophecy.

1050
01:21:29,844 --> 01:21:30,929
Prophecy.

1051
01:21:31,179 --> 01:21:32,472
The old tales will come true.

1052
01:21:32,722 --> 01:21:34,974
Vast halls of treasure!

1053
01:21:35,225 --> 01:21:36,393
Can it really be true?

1054
01:21:36,643 --> 01:21:39,354
Has the lord of silver fountains returned?

1055
01:21:39,687 --> 01:21:42,232
<i>The lord of the silver fountains</i>

1056
01:21:42,482 --> 01:21:44,734
<i>The King of carven stone</i>

1057
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:48,571
<i>The King beneath the mountain</i>

1058
01:21:49,781 --> 01:21:51,699
<i>Shall come into his own!</i>

1059
01:21:53,034 --> 01:21:54,911
And the bell shall ring in gladness...

1060
01:21:55,161 --> 01:21:55,745
<i>...At the Mountain...</i>

1061
01:21:55,995 --> 01:21:57,497
<i>...King's return</i>

1062
01:21:57,914 --> 01:22:00,458
<i>But all shall fail in sadness</i>

1063
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:03,795
<i>And the lake will shine and burn</i>

1064
01:22:06,798 --> 01:22:07,757
Da, I tried to stop them. but...

1065
01:22:08,007 --> 01:22:09,425
How long have they been gone?

1066
01:22:13,555 --> 01:22:15,223
Can you see anything?
Shh! Keep it down.

1067
01:22:15,473 --> 01:22:18,435
As soon as we have the
weapons, we make straight for the mountain.

1068
01:22:18,685 --> 01:22:19,853
go, go, go!

1069
01:22:20,270 --> 01:22:21,437
Go, Nori.

1070
01:22:24,566 --> 01:22:25,567
Next.

1071
01:22:38,872 --> 01:22:40,039
You all right?

1072
01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:41,583
I can manage.

1073
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:43,918
Let's just get out of here.

1074
01:22:57,932 --> 01:22:58,808
Run!

1075
01:22:59,058 --> 01:23:00,185
Quickly! Move now!

1076
01:23:14,324 --> 01:23:15,533
Get off me! Get off!

1077
01:23:15,783 --> 01:23:17,368
Move them along here.

1078
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:19,495
Move on!

1079
01:23:28,129 --> 01:23:29,589
What is the meaning of this?

1080
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:32,926
- We caught them stealing weapons, sire.
- Ah.

1081
01:23:33,426 --> 01:23:35,470
Enemies of the state, eh?

1082
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:36,513
A desperate bunch of...

1083
01:23:36,763 --> 01:23:38,932
...mercenaries, if ever there was, sire.

1084
01:23:39,182 --> 01:23:40,391
Hold your tongue!

1085
01:23:43,019 --> 01:23:45,104
You do not know to whom you speak.

1086
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:47,565
This is no common criminal.

1087
01:23:47,857 --> 01:23:49,192
This is Thorin...

1088
01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:52,570
...son of Thrain, son of Thror!

1089
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:57,825
We are the Dwarves of Erebor.

1090
01:24:00,537 --> 01:24:03,706
We have come to reclaim our homeland.

1091
01:24:08,419 --> 01:24:11,422
I remember this town
in the great days of old.

1092
01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:14,759
Fleets of boats lay at harbor...

1093
01:24:15,009 --> 01:24:16,427
...filled with silks and fine gems.

1094
01:24:17,804 --> 01:24:20,014
This was no forsaken town on a lake.

1095
01:24:21,057 --> 01:24:23,726
This was the center of all trade
in the North!

1096
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:26,145
I would...

1097
01:24:26,396 --> 01:24:27,605
...see those days return.

1098
01:24:27,855 --> 01:24:30,358
I would relight the great forges
of the Dwarves...

1099
01:24:30,608 --> 01:24:31,568
...and send wealth and riches...

1100
01:24:31,818 --> 01:24:34,279
...flowing once more
from the Halls of Erebor!

1101
01:24:37,282 --> 01:24:37,865
Death!

1102
01:24:39,075 --> 01:24:40,076
That is what you will...

1103
01:24:40,326 --> 01:24:41,619
...bring upon us!

1104
01:24:42,495 --> 01:24:44,163
Dragon fire and ruin.

1105
01:24:46,666 --> 01:24:48,543
If you waken that beast...

1106
01:24:49,168 --> 01:24:50,753
...it will destroy us all.

1107
01:24:51,004 --> 01:24:52,839
You can listen to this naysayer...

1108
01:24:53,089 --> 01:24:54,716
...but I promise you this:

1109
01:24:57,135 --> 01:24:58,553
If we succeed...

1110
01:24:59,929 --> 01:25:02,432
...all will share in the wealth
of the mountain.

1111
01:25:06,853 --> 01:25:09,897
You will have enough gold
to rebuild Esgaroth...

1112
01:25:10,148 --> 01:25:11,357
...10 times over!

1113
01:25:13,401 --> 01:25:14,569
All of you!

1114
01:25:14,902 --> 01:25:16,029
Listen to me!

1115
01:25:16,279 --> 01:25:17,322
You must listen!

1116
01:25:17,572 --> 01:25:19,282
Have you forgotten
what happened to Dale?

1117
01:25:21,117 --> 01:25:22,035
Have you forgotten those...

1118
01:25:22,285 --> 01:25:24,329
...who died in the firestorm?!

1119
01:25:26,623 --> 01:25:27,540
And for what purpose?

1120
01:25:29,042 --> 01:25:30,835
The blind ambition of a Mountain King...

1121
01:25:31,711 --> 01:25:33,713
...so riven by greed, he could not...

1122
01:25:33,963 --> 01:25:35,465
...see beyond his own desire!

1123
01:25:36,716 --> 01:25:38,343
Now, now!

1124
01:25:38,635 --> 01:25:40,595
We must not, any of us...

1125
01:25:40,845 --> 01:25:43,222
...be too quick to lay blame.

1126
01:25:44,349 --> 01:25:44,932
Let us...

1127
01:25:45,183 --> 01:25:46,893
...not forget that it was...

1128
01:25:47,143 --> 01:25:48,936
...Girion, Lord of Dale...

1129
01:25:49,187 --> 01:25:50,855
...your ancestor...

1130
01:25:51,105 --> 01:25:53,608
...who failed to kill the beast!

1131
01:25:56,152 --> 01:25:58,112
It's true, sire.

1132
01:25:58,363 --> 01:25:59,572
We all know the story.

1133
01:26:01,157 --> 01:26:02,825
Arrow after arrow, he shot.

1134
01:26:03,076 --> 01:26:05,662
Each one missing its mark.

1135
01:26:12,418 --> 01:26:13,670
You have no right.

1136
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:17,298
No right to enter that mountain.

1137
01:26:19,008 --> 01:26:21,135
I have the only right.

1138
01:26:27,475 --> 01:26:28,851
I speak to the Master...

1139
01:26:29,102 --> 01:26:30,561
...of the Men of the Lake.

1140
01:26:30,812 --> 01:26:33,106
Will you see the prophecy fulfilled?

1141
01:26:34,065 --> 01:26:35,024
Will you...

1142
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:39,153
...share in the great wealth
of our people?

1143
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:45,618
What say you?

1144
01:26:49,497 --> 01:26:52,542
I say unto you...

1145
01:26:53,793 --> 01:26:54,794
Welcome!

1146
01:26:55,336 --> 01:26:56,003
Welcome!

1147
01:26:56,379 --> 01:26:57,338
And thrice...

1148
01:26:57,588 --> 01:26:58,589
...welcome...

1149
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,466
...King Under the Mountain!

1150
01:27:12,562 --> 01:27:15,064
You do know we're one short.
Where's Bofur?

1151
01:27:15,314 --> 01:27:17,942
- If he's not here, we leave him behind.
- We'll have to.

1152
01:27:18,192 --> 01:27:19,152
If we're to find the door before...

1153
01:27:19,402 --> 01:27:21,946
...nightfall, we can risk no more delays.

1154
01:27:26,367 --> 01:27:27,118
Not you.

1155
01:27:27,952 --> 01:27:30,163
We must travel at speed.
You will slow us down.

1156
01:27:31,456 --> 01:27:33,249
What are you talking about?
I'm coming with you.

1157
01:27:33,499 --> 01:27:34,417
Not now.

1158
01:27:40,131 --> 01:27:41,799
I'm going to be there
when that door is opened.

1159
01:27:42,049 --> 01:27:44,135
When we first look upon
the Halls of our Fathers, Thorin.

1160
01:27:44,385 --> 01:27:46,637
Kili, stay here.

1161
01:27:47,263 --> 01:27:48,389
Rest.

1162
01:27:49,223 --> 01:27:50,641
Join us when you're healed.

1163
01:27:56,230 --> 01:27:57,565
I'll stay with the lad.

1164
01:27:57,815 --> 01:27:59,609
My duty lies with the wounded.

1165
01:27:59,859 --> 01:28:00,818
Uncle.

1166
01:28:01,694 --> 01:28:03,404
We grew up on tales of the mountain.

1167
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:04,906
Tales you told us.

1168
01:28:05,156 --> 01:28:06,073
You cannot take that away...

1169
01:28:06,324 --> 01:28:07,325
- ... from him!
- Fili.

1170
01:28:07,575 --> 01:28:08,618
I will carry him if I must!

1171
01:28:08,868 --> 01:28:11,287
One day you will be king
and you will understand.

1172
01:28:12,038 --> 01:28:15,333
I cannot risk the fate of this quest
for the sake of one .

1173
01:28:16,626 --> 01:28:18,419
Not even my own kin.

1174
01:28:22,089 --> 01:28:22,924
Fili, don't be a fool.

1175
01:28:23,925 --> 01:28:24,926
You belong with the company.

1176
01:28:25,176 --> 01:28:26,803
I belong with my brother.

1177
01:28:38,314 --> 01:28:42,151
By my beard, is that the time?! Ah!

1178
01:28:43,236 --> 01:28:46,280
Go now with our goodwill...

1179
01:28:46,531 --> 01:28:47,907
...and good wishes.

1180
01:28:49,242 --> 01:28:52,036
- And may your return bring good fortune...
- Wait!

1181
01:28:52,286 --> 01:28:53,412
...to all!

1182
01:28:57,834 --> 01:28:58,876
Good bye.

1183
01:29:05,383 --> 01:29:05,967
Out of the way!

1184
01:29:06,217 --> 01:29:07,552
No! No!

1185
01:29:14,183 --> 01:29:16,185
Ha. So you missed the boat as well?

1186
01:29:16,852 --> 01:29:18,020
Kili? Kili!

1187
01:29:21,774 --> 01:29:22,775
No.

1188
01:29:23,025 --> 01:29:24,652
I'm done with Dwarves. Go away.

1189
01:29:24,902 --> 01:29:25,486
No, no...

1190
01:29:25,736 --> 01:29:26,529
...no! Please!

1191
01:29:26,821 --> 01:29:29,323
No one will help us. Kilt's sick.

1192
01:29:31,951 --> 01:29:33,035
He's very sick.

1193
01:30:13,367 --> 01:30:14,994
What is this place?

1194
01:30:15,244 --> 01:30:16,537
It was once the city of Dale.

1195
01:30:18,539 --> 01:30:20,207
Now it is a ruin.

1196
01:30:20,958 --> 01:30:23,169
The desolation of Smaug.

1197
01:30:23,419 --> 01:30:25,338
The sun will soon reach midday.

1198
01:30:25,588 --> 01:30:27,840
We must find the hidden door
into the mountain before it sets.

1199
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:28,925
This way.

1200
01:30:29,175 --> 01:30:31,218
Wait. Is this the overlook?

1201
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,887
Gandalf said to meet him here.

1202
01:30:33,137 --> 01:30:34,764
- On no account were we to-
- Do you see him?

1203
01:30:35,431 --> 01:30:36,098
We have no time...

1204
01:30:36,349 --> 01:30:37,725
...to wait upon the Wizard.

1205
01:30:38,017 --> 01:30:39,769
We're on our own. Come!

1206
01:30:56,911 --> 01:30:58,663
Dol Guldur.

1207
01:30:58,913 --> 01:31:01,082
The Hill of Sorcery.

1208
01:31:01,332 --> 01:31:03,584
It looks completely abandoned.

1209
01:31:03,834 --> 01:31:05,294
As it is meant to.

1210
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:07,755
A spell of concealment...

1211
01:31:08,005 --> 01:31:11,092
...lies over this place, which means...

1212
01:31:11,342 --> 01:31:14,428
...our Enemy is not yet ready
to reveal himself.

1213
01:31:16,389 --> 01:31:19,725
He has not regained his full strength.

1214
01:31:20,184 --> 01:31:23,521
Radagast, I need you to carry
a message to the Lady Galadriel.

1215
01:31:23,771 --> 01:31:25,981
Tell her we must force his hand.

1216
01:31:26,232 --> 01:31:27,274
What do you mean?

1217
01:31:27,525 --> 01:31:29,110
I'm going in alone.

1218
01:31:29,443 --> 01:31:31,862
On no account come after me.

1219
01:31:37,994 --> 01:31:39,286
Do I have your word?

1220
01:31:39,537 --> 01:31:41,539
Yes, yes, yes!

1221
01:31:53,259 --> 01:31:54,719
Wait, Gandalf!

1222
01:31:55,886 --> 01:31:57,805
What if it's a trap?!

1223
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:02,643
Turn around and do not come back.

1224
01:32:07,523 --> 01:32:10,359
It's undoubtedly a trap.

1225
01:32:44,143 --> 01:32:48,100
The evil that is hidden here ...

1226
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,011
I command it come forth!

1227
01:32:52,312 --> 01:32:55,712
I command it reveal itself!

1228
01:33:10,213 --> 01:33:16,513
The evil that is hidden here,
I command it come forth!

1229
01:33:16,967 --> 01:33:19,014
The Wizard has come.

1230
01:33:19,355 --> 01:33:21,745
He is lifting the spell ...

1231
01:33:21,886 --> 01:33:23,646
He will find us!

1232
01:33:23,977 --> 01:33:26,677
Yes ... he will.

1233
01:33:33,067 --> 01:33:34,026
Anything?

1234
01:33:34,276 --> 01:33:35,778
Nothing!

1235
01:33:39,573 --> 01:33:40,908
If the map is true...

1236
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:44,203
...then the hidden door
lies directly above us.

1237
01:33:48,749 --> 01:33:50,376
Up here!

1238
01:33:58,759 --> 01:34:01,220
You have keen eyes, Master Baggins.

1239
01:34:33,085 --> 01:34:34,169
This must be it.

1240
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:37,882
The hidden door.

1241
01:34:42,136 --> 01:34:43,888
Let all those who doubted us...

1242
01:34:45,055 --> 01:34:46,390
...rue this day!

1243
01:34:52,104 --> 01:34:54,565
Right, then. We have a key.

1244
01:34:56,275 --> 01:34:57,776
Which means that somewhere...

1245
01:34:58,903 --> 01:35:00,279
...there is a key-hole.

1246
01:35:00,988 --> 01:35:03,866
"The last light of Durin's Day...

1247
01:35:05,868 --> 01:35:06,702
...will shine upon...

1248
01:35:06,952 --> 01:35:08,370
...the key-hole. "

1249
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,589
Nori.

1250
01:35:25,221 --> 01:35:27,181
We're losing the light. Come on.

1251
01:35:33,687 --> 01:35:36,273
Be quiet! I can't hear when you're thumping.

1252
01:35:36,523 --> 01:35:37,316
I can't find it.

1253
01:35:38,776 --> 01:35:40,110
It's not here!

1254
01:35:40,361 --> 01:35:41,445
It's not here!

1255
01:35:43,197 --> 01:35:44,281
- Break it down!
- Aye.

1256
01:35:46,283 --> 01:35:47,076
Come on!

1257
01:35:49,245 --> 01:35:49,995
Break!

1258
01:35:50,246 --> 01:35:51,247
It has to break.

1259
01:35:52,206 --> 01:35:53,540
It's no good.

1260
01:35:53,791 --> 01:35:56,293
The door's sealed. Can't be opened by force.

1261
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,046
There's a powerful magic on it.

1262
01:36:08,681 --> 01:36:09,807
No!

1263
01:36:15,145 --> 01:36:17,439
"The last light of Durin's Day...

1264
01:36:19,316 --> 01:36:20,901
...will shine upon the key-hole. "

1265
01:36:25,322 --> 01:36:26,907
That is what it says.

1266
01:36:31,412 --> 01:36:32,830
What did we miss?

1267
01:36:36,792 --> 01:36:38,252
What did we miss?

1268
01:36:39,295 --> 01:36:40,254
Balin?

1269
01:36:40,879 --> 01:36:42,589
We've lost the light.

1270
01:36:45,134 --> 01:36:46,969
There's no more to be done.

1271
01:36:48,512 --> 01:36:49,096
We had but...

1272
01:36:49,346 --> 01:36:50,597
...one chance.

1273
01:36:53,017 --> 01:36:54,268
Come away, lads.

1274
01:36:54,518 --> 01:36:56,312
It's over.

1275
01:36:57,396 --> 01:36:59,523
- Wait a minute.
- We're too late.

1276
01:37:02,026 --> 01:37:03,444
Where are they going?

1277
01:37:05,237 --> 01:37:07,114
You can't give up now!

1278
01:37:22,046 --> 01:37:23,213
Thorin.

1279
01:37:25,257 --> 01:37:26,925
You can't give up now.

1280
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:40,856
"Stand by the gray stone...

1281
01:37:42,733 --> 01:37:44,818
...when the thrush knocks. "

1282
01:37:45,569 --> 01:37:46,945
The setting sun.

1283
01:37:47,988 --> 01:37:50,866
And "the last light of Durin's Day
will shine... "

1284
01:37:52,367 --> 01:37:53,827
The last light.

1285
01:37:56,371 --> 01:37:57,748
Last light.

1286
01:38:34,451 --> 01:38:35,702
The last light!

1287
01:38:45,921 --> 01:38:47,047
The key-hole!

1288
01:38:47,548 --> 01:38:48,132
Come back!

1289
01:38:48,924 --> 01:38:50,259
Come back!

1290
01:38:50,509 --> 01:38:52,678
It's the light of the moon! The last...

1291
01:38:52,928 --> 01:38:56,014
...moon of autumn! Ha, ha, ha!

1292
01:38:57,933 --> 01:39:00,310
Where's the key? Where's the key?
Where's the... ?

1293
01:39:00,561 --> 01:39:02,271
It was here.

1294
01:39:02,521 --> 01:39:04,314
Come on, it was... It was here.

1295
01:39:05,023 --> 01:39:05,858
It was just...

1296
01:40:03,874 --> 01:40:05,334
Erebor.

1297
01:40:06,043 --> 01:40:07,169
Thorin.

1298
01:40:20,557 --> 01:40:22,434
I know these walls.

1299
01:40:26,188 --> 01:40:27,731
These halls.

1300
01:40:30,734 --> 01:40:32,110
This stone.

1301
01:40:36,031 --> 01:40:36,657
You remember it...

1302
01:40:36,907 --> 01:40:38,033
...Balin.

1303
01:40:41,662 --> 01:40:44,164
Chambers filled with golden light.

1304
01:40:46,041 --> 01:40:47,542
I remember.

1305
01:41:00,806 --> 01:41:02,140
"Herein lies...

1306
01:41:02,391 --> 01:41:04,268
...the Seventh Kingdom of...

1307
01:41:04,518 --> 01:41:05,686
...Durin's Folk. "

1308
01:41:07,646 --> 01:41:10,732
" May the Heart of the Mountain
unite all...

1309
01:41:10,983 --> 01:41:14,569
...Dwarves in defense of this home. "

1310
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:18,115
The Throne of the King.

1311
01:41:18,782 --> 01:41:20,117
Ah.

1312
01:41:21,827 --> 01:41:25,163
And what's that above it?

1313
01:41:28,709 --> 01:41:30,460
The Arkenstone.

1314
01:41:31,753 --> 01:41:33,171
Arkenstone.

1315
01:41:37,092 --> 01:41:38,427
And what's that?

1316
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:41,722
That, Master Burglar...

1317
01:41:42,764 --> 01:41:44,808
...is why you are here.

1318
01:42:03,702 --> 01:42:05,412
Can you not do something?

1319
01:42:05,662 --> 01:42:07,873
I need herbs.
Something to bring down his fever.

1320
01:42:08,123 --> 01:42:10,500
I have nightshade. I have feverfew.

1321
01:42:10,751 --> 01:42:13,545
They're no use to me.
Do you have any kingsfoil?

1322
01:42:13,795 --> 01:42:15,797
No, it's a weed. We feed it to the pigs.

1323
01:42:16,256 --> 01:42:17,382
Pigs?

1324
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:18,759
Weed.

1325
01:42:19,509 --> 01:42:20,635
Right.

1326
01:42:21,595 --> 01:42:22,763
Don't move.

1327
01:42:25,557 --> 01:42:29,102
You want me to find a jewel?

1328
01:42:30,646 --> 01:42:32,356
A large, white jewel.

1329
01:42:32,814 --> 01:42:33,940
Yes.

1330
01:42:35,317 --> 01:42:37,903
That's it? Only, I imagine
there's quite a few down there.

1331
01:42:38,236 --> 01:42:41,448
There is only one Arkenstone...

1332
01:42:42,199 --> 01:42:44,284
...and you'll know it when you see it.

1333
01:42:45,410 --> 01:42:46,536
Right.

1334
01:42:50,290 --> 01:42:50,874
In truth...

1335
01:42:51,124 --> 01:42:52,000
...lad...

1336
01:42:52,793 --> 01:42:54,836
...I do not know...

1337
01:42:55,087 --> 01:42:57,172
...what you will find down there.

1338
01:42:59,299 --> 01:43:02,427
You needn't go if you don't want to.
There's no dishonor in turning back.

1339
01:43:02,677 --> 01:43:03,637
No, Balin.

1340
01:43:04,888 --> 01:43:06,932
I promised I would do this...

1341
01:43:07,599 --> 01:43:09,309
...and I think I must try.

1342
01:43:14,022 --> 01:43:15,732
It never ceases to amaze me.

1343
01:43:15,982 --> 01:43:16,775
What's that?

1344
01:43:17,025 --> 01:43:18,735
The courage of Hobbits.

1345
01:43:21,113 --> 01:43:22,364
Go now...

1346
01:43:22,864 --> 01:43:26,868
...with as much luck as you can muster.

1347
01:43:34,084 --> 01:43:35,377
Oh, Bilbo?

1348
01:43:37,796 --> 01:43:40,090
If there is, in fact...

1349
01:43:41,591 --> 01:43:42,426
...a live dragon...

1350
01:43:42,676 --> 01:43:43,718
...down there...

1351
01:43:46,763 --> 01:43:48,181
...don't waken it.

1352
01:44:31,082 --> 01:44:34,582
The evil that is hidden here ...

1353
01:44:35,928 --> 01:44:39,583
I command it come forth!

1354
01:44:40,184 --> 01:44:44,584
I command it reveal itself!

1355
01:44:56,745 --> 01:45:00,755
You have come too late, Wizard!

1356
01:45:01,886 --> 01:45:03,956
It is done.

1357
01:45:05,759 --> 01:45:07,219
Where is your master?

1358
01:45:09,012 --> 01:45:10,096
Where is he?!

1359
01:45:10,931 --> 01:45:13,725
He is everwhere ...

1360
01:45:14,156 --> 01:45:16,826
We are legion!

1361
01:45:30,807 --> 01:45:32,927
It is over.

1362
01:45:38,928 --> 01:45:40,528
Run him down!

1363
01:45:57,894 --> 01:46:00,570
There is no light, Wizard ...

1364
01:46:01,671 --> 01:46:05,121
... that can defeat darkness.

1365
01:47:23,563 --> 01:47:26,358
Sauron!

1366
01:47:49,047 --> 01:47:50,131
Hello?

1367
01:48:09,150 --> 01:48:10,568
He's not at home.

1368
01:48:11,528 --> 01:48:13,196
Not at home. Ahem.

1369
01:48:14,030 --> 01:48:15,115
Good.

1370
01:48:16,908 --> 01:48:18,660
Good, good... good.

1371
01:49:12,839 --> 01:49:13,423
What's that?

1372
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:19,471
Shush. Shush.

1373
01:49:20,805 --> 01:49:22,098
Arkenstone.

1374
01:49:23,141 --> 01:49:24,517
Arkenstone.

1375
01:49:25,351 --> 01:49:27,395
A large, white jewel.

1376
01:49:29,606 --> 01:49:30,982
Very helpful.

1377
01:51:56,586 --> 01:51:57,962
Well...

1378
01:51:59,631 --> 01:52:00,924
...thief.

1379
01:52:02,926 --> 01:52:06,554
I smell you.

1380
01:52:06,930 --> 01:52:10,141
I hear your breath.

1381
01:52:11,434 --> 01:52:13,061
I feel...

1382
01:52:13,311 --> 01:52:14,229
...your air.

1383
01:52:18,149 --> 01:52:20,693
Where are you?

1384
01:52:22,153 --> 01:52:23,238
Where are you?

1385
01:52:43,383 --> 01:52:44,384
Come, now...

1386
01:52:45,134 --> 01:52:47,261
...don't be shy.

1387
01:52:47,512 --> 01:52:49,722
Step into the light.

1388
01:52:53,935 --> 01:52:54,519
<i>Hmm.</i>

1389
01:52:56,646 --> 01:52:59,857
There is something about you.

1390
01:53:03,236 --> 01:53:04,028
Something you...

1391
01:53:04,279 --> 01:53:05,113
...carry.

1392
01:53:06,281 --> 01:53:09,158
Something made of gold.

1393
01:53:09,909 --> 01:53:12,829
But far more...

1394
01:53:13,079 --> 01:53:14,872
...precious.

1395
01:53:15,123 --> 01:53:17,458
<i>Precious! Precious!</i>

1396
01:53:20,253 --> 01:53:21,421
There you are...

1397
01:53:21,671 --> 01:53:23,214
...Thief in the...

1398
01:53:23,464 --> 01:53:25,299
...Shadows.

1399
01:53:27,135 --> 01:53:29,721
I did not come to steal from you...

1400
01:53:29,971 --> 01:53:30,763
...Oh Smaug...

1401
01:53:31,014 --> 01:53:34,267
...the Unassessably Wealthy.
I merely wanted...

1402
01:53:34,517 --> 01:53:36,144
...to gaze upon your magnificence.

1403
01:53:36,477 --> 01:53:37,311
To see...

1404
01:53:37,562 --> 01:53:40,523
...if you really were as great
as the old tales say.

1405
01:53:41,232 --> 01:53:42,984
I did not believe them.

1406
01:53:51,826 --> 01:53:55,747
And do you now?!

1407
01:53:57,081 --> 01:53:58,333
Truly...

1408
01:53:59,667 --> 01:54:01,836
...the tales and songs...

1409
01:54:02,962 --> 01:54:05,673
...fall utterly short of your enormity...

1410
01:54:05,923 --> 01:54:08,885
...Oh Smaug the Stupendous.

1411
01:54:09,135 --> 01:54:12,013
Do you think flattery will keep you alive?

1412
01:54:12,513 --> 01:54:13,473
No, no.

1413
01:54:13,723 --> 01:54:15,224
No, indeed.

1414
01:54:17,477 --> 01:54:20,730
You seem familiar with my name...

1415
01:54:20,980 --> 01:54:23,858
...but I don't remember smelling
your kind before.

1416
01:54:24,984 --> 01:54:26,569
Who are you...

1417
01:54:26,819 --> 01:54:29,322
...and where do you come from?

1418
01:54:29,572 --> 01:54:31,908
may I ask?

1419
01:54:41,459 --> 01:54:43,127
I come from under the hill.

1420
01:54:43,503 --> 01:54:44,879
Underhill?

1421
01:54:48,591 --> 01:54:49,467
And under hills...

1422
01:54:49,717 --> 01:54:51,719
...and over hills my path has led.

1423
01:54:52,595 --> 01:54:53,429
And... And...

1424
01:54:54,222 --> 01:54:56,557
...through the air.
I am he who walks unseen.

1425
01:54:56,808 --> 01:54:58,518
Impressive.

1426
01:54:58,768 --> 01:55:00,812
What else do you claim to be?

1427
01:55:01,771 --> 01:55:02,563
I am...

1428
01:55:05,817 --> 01:55:07,276
Luck... Luck-wearer.

1429
01:55:08,736 --> 01:55:09,904
Riddle... Riddle-maker.

1430
01:55:10,154 --> 01:55:11,823
Lovely titles!

1431
01:55:12,532 --> 01:55:13,699
Go on.

1432
01:55:13,950 --> 01:55:15,034
Barrel-rider.

1433
01:55:15,284 --> 01:55:18,704
Barrels? Now that is interesting.

1434
01:55:20,164 --> 01:55:20,873
And what about...

1435
01:55:21,124 --> 01:55:24,085
...your little  friends?

1436
01:55:25,211 --> 01:55:26,462
Where are they hiding?

1437
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:30,883
Dw... Dwarves?

1438
01:55:31,717 --> 01:55:32,802
No.

1439
01:55:33,469 --> 01:55:35,012
No, no. No Dwarves here.

1440
01:55:35,263 --> 01:55:36,347
You've got that all wrong.

1441
01:55:36,597 --> 01:55:40,351
Oh, I don't think so, Barrel-rider!

1442
01:55:40,935 --> 01:55:42,186
They sent you in here...

1443
01:55:42,437 --> 01:55:44,397
...to do their dirty work while they...

1444
01:55:44,647 --> 01:55:46,607
...skulk about outside.

1445
01:55:47,859 --> 01:55:49,026
Truly...

1446
01:55:49,819 --> 01:55:50,987
...you are mistaken...

1447
01:55:51,237 --> 01:55:54,240
...Oh Smaug, Chiefest
and Greatest of Calamities.

1448
01:55:54,490 --> 01:55:57,869
You have nice manners...

1449
01:55:58,119 --> 01:56:00,079
...for a thief and...

1450
01:56:00,329 --> 01:56:01,247
...a liar!

1451
01:56:02,623 --> 01:56:06,002
I know the smell and taste of .

1452
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:07,628
No one better!

1453
01:56:09,380 --> 01:56:10,756
It is the gold!

1454
01:56:11,007 --> 01:56:11,757
They are drawn...

1455
01:56:12,008 --> 01:56:13,050
...to treasure like...

1456
01:56:13,301 --> 01:56:14,844
...flies to dead flesh.

1457
01:56:18,389 --> 01:56:19,599
Did you think I did not know...

1458
01:56:20,099 --> 01:56:21,559
...this day would come?!

1459
01:56:23,436 --> 01:56:24,729
That a pack of...

1460
01:56:24,979 --> 01:56:26,272
...canting Dwarves...

1461
01:56:26,522 --> 01:56:28,858
...would come crawling back...

1462
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:30,651
...to the mountain?!

1463
01:56:35,198 --> 01:56:36,407
Was that an earthquake?

1464
01:56:36,657 --> 01:56:38,784
That, my lad...

1465
01:56:41,996 --> 01:56:43,456
...was a dragon.

1466
01:56:51,756 --> 01:56:52,340
Da?

1467
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:54,467
It's coming from the mountain.

1468
01:56:58,512 --> 01:56:59,764
You should leave us.

1469
01:57:00,056 --> 01:57:00,681
Take your children.

1470
01:57:00,932 --> 01:57:01,807
Get out of here.

1471
01:57:02,475 --> 01:57:03,768
And go where?

1472
01:57:04,852 --> 01:57:06,229
There is nowhere to go.

1473
01:57:08,189 --> 01:57:09,732
Are we going to die, Da?

1474
01:57:11,776 --> 01:57:12,944
No, darling.

1475
01:57:13,194 --> 01:57:13,778
The dragon.

1476
01:57:14,028 --> 01:57:15,488
It's going to kill us.

1477
01:57:26,165 --> 01:57:27,959
Not if I kill it first.

1478
01:57:29,418 --> 01:57:33,089
The King Under the Mountain is dead.

1479
01:57:33,339 --> 01:57:35,007
I took his throne.

1480
01:57:35,383 --> 01:57:36,300
I ate his...

1481
01:57:36,550 --> 01:57:39,345
...people like a wolf among sheep.

1482
01:57:43,099 --> 01:57:44,267
I kill where...

1483
01:57:44,517 --> 01:57:46,143
...I wish, when...

1484
01:57:46,394 --> 01:57:47,853
...I Wish.

1485
01:57:48,104 --> 01:57:51,399
My armor is iron.

1486
01:58:00,575 --> 01:58:02,994
No blade can pierce me.

1487
01:58:06,163 --> 01:58:07,415
All right.

1488
01:58:07,665 --> 01:58:10,001
A Black Arrow? Why did you never tell me'?

1489
01:58:10,251 --> 01:58:11,877
Because you did not need to know.

1490
01:58:19,468 --> 01:58:21,012
Listen to me carefully.

1491
01:58:21,387 --> 01:58:23,514
I need you to distract the guards.

1492
01:58:24,098 --> 01:58:24,682
Once I'm at the top of...

1493
01:58:24,932 --> 01:58:27,226
...the tower, I'll set the arrow to the bow.

1494
01:58:27,476 --> 01:58:28,060
There he is!

1495
01:58:28,311 --> 01:58:28,894
Bard!

1496
01:58:29,145 --> 01:58:31,314
- After him!
- Quickly! Down there. Go!

1497
01:58:31,564 --> 01:58:32,148
Stop him!

1498
01:58:39,614 --> 01:58:40,448
Stop him!

1499
01:58:41,324 --> 01:58:41,907
Stop!

1500
01:58:46,078 --> 01:58:47,747
Bain! Bain.

1501
01:58:48,581 --> 01:58:52,251
Keep it safe. Don't let anyone find it.
I'll deal with them.

1502
01:58:52,501 --> 01:58:54,211
- I'm not leaving you.
- Now go!

1503
01:58:58,174 --> 01:58:58,799
Braga.

1504
01:58:59,050 --> 01:58:59,675
You're under arrest.

1505
01:58:59,925 --> 01:59:02,803
- On what charge?
- Any charge the Master chooses.

1506
01:59:32,792 --> 01:59:34,210
Where's he gone?

1507
01:59:45,471 --> 01:59:46,555
What about Bilbo?

1508
01:59:46,806 --> 01:59:47,807
Give him more time.

1509
01:59:48,057 --> 01:59:50,226
Time to do what? To be killed?

1510
01:59:52,686 --> 01:59:53,938
You're afraid.

1511
01:59:55,606 --> 01:59:57,900
Yes, I'm afraid.

1512
01:59:59,068 --> 02:00:00,403
I fear for you.

1513
02:00:01,779 --> 02:00:03,948
A sickness lies upon that treasure hoard.

1514
02:00:04,365 --> 02:00:05,157
A sickness which drove...

1515
02:00:05,408 --> 02:00:06,700
...your grandfather mad.

1516
02:00:06,951 --> 02:00:08,536
I am not my grandfather.

1517
02:00:08,786 --> 02:00:10,538
You're not yourself.

1518
02:00:11,414 --> 02:00:13,541
The Thorin I know would not hesitate
to go in there...

1519
02:00:13,791 --> 02:00:14,375
I will not risk...

1520
02:00:14,625 --> 02:00:18,421
...this quest for the life of one burglar.

1521
02:00:20,297 --> 02:00:21,716
Bilbo.

1522
02:00:22,091 --> 02:00:24,009
His name is Bilbo.

1523
02:00:27,763 --> 02:00:29,557
It's Oakenshield...

1524
02:00:29,849 --> 02:00:32,810
...that filthy Dwarvish usurper.

1525
02:00:35,062 --> 02:00:37,189
He sent you in here...

1526
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:40,192
...for the Arkenstone, didn't he?

1527
02:00:40,443 --> 02:00:41,068
No. No...

1528
02:00:41,318 --> 02:00:44,196
...no. I don't know
what you're talking about.

1529
02:00:44,447 --> 02:00:45,573
Don't bother denying it.

1530
02:00:46,949 --> 02:00:48,784
I guessed his foul purpose
some time ago.

1531
02:00:51,454 --> 02:00:52,955
But it matters not.

1532
02:00:54,123 --> 02:00:56,500
Oakenshield's quest will fail.

1533
02:00:58,502 --> 02:01:00,254
The darkness is coming.

1534
02:01:01,088 --> 02:01:05,092
<i>It will spread to every corner of the land.</i>

1535
02:01:36,193 --> 02:01:40,093
The Dwarf-scum are around here.

1536
02:01:40,204 --> 02:01:43,404
I smell them.

1537
02:01:47,676 --> 02:01:49,637
You are being used, Thief...

1538
02:01:49,887 --> 02:01:52,014
...in the Shadows.
You were only...

1539
02:01:52,264 --> 02:01:54,850
...ever a means to an end.

1540
02:01:55,684 --> 02:01:56,268
The coward...

1541
02:01:56,519 --> 02:01:59,104
...Oakenshield has weighed...

1542
02:01:59,355 --> 02:02:00,940
...the value of your life...

1543
02:02:01,190 --> 02:02:03,359
...and found it worth nothing.

1544
02:02:03,984 --> 02:02:05,152
No.

1545
02:02:05,903 --> 02:02:06,570
No.

1546
02:02:07,863 --> 02:02:08,823
No, you're lying.

1547
02:02:09,073 --> 02:02:10,241
What did he promise you?

1548
02:02:10,699 --> 02:02:12,785
A share of the treasure?

1549
02:02:13,786 --> 02:02:14,912
As if it was his...

1550
02:02:15,162 --> 02:02:16,247
...to give.

1551
02:02:17,081 --> 02:02:18,832
I will not part with...

1552
02:02:19,083 --> 02:02:20,084
...a single coin.

1553
02:02:20,751 --> 02:02:23,295
Not one piece of it.

1554
02:02:27,174 --> 02:02:28,050
My teeth...

1555
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:29,468
...are swords.

1556
02:02:30,386 --> 02:02:33,681
My claws are spears.

1557
02:02:35,808 --> 02:02:36,976
My Wings...

1558
02:02:37,601 --> 02:02:40,145
...are a hurricane.

1559
02:02:45,776 --> 02:02:47,611
So it is true.

1560
02:02:47,987 --> 02:02:50,114
The Black Arrow found its mark.

1561
02:02:50,364 --> 02:02:51,282
What did you say?

1562
02:02:52,116 --> 02:02:55,995
I was just saying your reputation
precedes you, O Smaug...

1563
02:02:56,245 --> 02:02:57,454
...the Tyrannical.

1564
02:02:58,038 --> 02:02:59,123
Truly.

1565
02:02:59,373 --> 02:03:01,333
You have no equal on this earth.

1566
02:03:05,754 --> 02:03:06,422
I am...

1567
02:03:06,672 --> 02:03:09,925
...almost tempted to let you take it.

1568
02:03:10,384 --> 02:03:12,386
If only to see Oakenshield...

1569
02:03:12,636 --> 02:03:13,596
...suffer.

1570
02:03:14,680 --> 02:03:15,764
Watch it...

1571
02:03:16,015 --> 02:03:17,516
...destroy him.

1572
02:03:18,017 --> 02:03:21,145
Watch it corrupt his heart...

1573
02:03:21,812 --> 02:03:24,189
...and drive him mad.

1574
02:03:27,401 --> 02:03:28,986
But I think not.

1575
02:03:29,570 --> 02:03:31,822
I think our little game ends here.

1576
02:03:32,656 --> 02:03:33,908
So tell me...

1577
02:03:34,158 --> 02:03:35,034
...thief...

1578
02:03:35,909 --> 02:03:38,037
...how do you choose to die?

1579
02:04:21,497 --> 02:04:22,331
Nah.

1580
02:04:50,693 --> 02:04:52,736
Da? Is that you, Da?

1581
02:05:25,853 --> 02:05:27,187
- Aah!
- Stay down!

1582
02:06:27,998 --> 02:06:28,665
Get down!

1583
02:06:41,011 --> 02:06:42,930
Oakenshield has gone!

1584
02:06:43,931 --> 02:06:45,101
Fall back!

1585
02:06:45,202 --> 02:06:47,002
Regroup at the bridge!

1586
02:07:05,202 --> 02:07:06,370
You killed them all.

1587
02:07:06,620 --> 02:07:07,704
There are others.

1588
02:07:08,121 --> 02:07:09,206
Tauriel.

1589
02:07:09,706 --> 02:07:10,791
Come.

1590
02:07:14,837 --> 02:07:15,796
We're losing him.

1591
02:07:19,716 --> 02:07:20,926
Tauriel.

1592
02:07:44,867 --> 02:07:45,868
Athens.

1593
02:07:48,704 --> 02:07:50,122
Athens.

1594
02:07:51,123 --> 02:07:52,207
What are you doing?

1595
02:07:55,210 --> 02:07:56,920
I'm going to save him.

1596
02:08:17,691 --> 02:08:18,984
- You're alive!
- Not for much longer.

1597
02:08:19,234 --> 02:08:22,196
- Did you find the Arkenstone? The Arkenstone.
- The dragon's coming.

1598
02:08:25,157 --> 02:08:26,742
Did you find it?

1599
02:08:32,247 --> 02:08:33,332
We have to get out.

1600
02:08:37,044 --> 02:08:38,045
Thorin.

1601
02:08:41,757 --> 02:08:42,883
Thorin.

1602
02:09:13,330 --> 02:09:15,457
You will burn!

1603
02:09:16,625 --> 02:09:17,459
- Run!
- Ah!

1604
02:09:24,591 --> 02:09:25,676
Come on, Bilbo!

1605
02:09:38,563 --> 02:09:39,606
Come on.

1606
02:09:56,748 --> 02:09:57,958
Hold him down.

1607
02:10:14,349 --> 02:10:16,101
Unh! Tilda.

1608
02:11:08,987 --> 02:11:10,155
Shh, Shh, Shh!

1609
02:11:17,996 --> 02:11:19,456
We've given him the slip.

1610
02:11:19,706 --> 02:11:20,707
No.

1611
02:11:21,166 --> 02:11:23,376
He's too cunning for that.

1612
02:11:25,128 --> 02:11:26,254
So where to now?

1613
02:11:26,838 --> 02:11:28,173
The western guardroom.

1614
02:11:28,882 --> 02:11:30,425
There may be a way out.

1615
02:11:30,675 --> 02:11:32,677
It's too high. There's no chance...

1616
02:11:32,928 --> 02:11:35,013
- ... that way.
- It's our only chance.

1617
02:11:36,348 --> 02:11:37,808
We have to try.

1618
02:11:54,366 --> 02:11:55,534
Come on.

1619
02:12:43,039 --> 02:12:46,793
I've heard tell of
the wonders of Elvish medicine.

1620
02:12:47,043 --> 02:12:49,754
That was a privilege to witness.

1621
02:12:52,257 --> 02:12:53,425
Tauriel.

1622
02:12:57,721 --> 02:12:58,930
Lie still.

1623
02:13:06,146 --> 02:13:08,231
You cannot be her.

1624
02:13:11,735 --> 02:13:13,904
She is far away.

1625
02:13:18,074 --> 02:13:19,492
She is far...

1626
02:13:19,743 --> 02:13:21,328
...far away from me.

1627
02:13:22,954 --> 02:13:25,081
She walks...

1628
02:13:25,332 --> 02:13:28,001
...in starlight in another world.

1629
02:13:33,340 --> 02:13:35,300
It was just a dream.

1630
02:13:46,978 --> 02:13:49,189
Do you think she could've loved me?

1631
02:13:56,530 --> 02:13:57,155
Stay close.

1632
02:14:07,916 --> 02:14:08,667
That's it, then.

1633
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:11,795
There's no way out.

1634
02:14:18,218 --> 02:14:20,428
The last of our kin.

1635
02:14:24,140 --> 02:14:26,226
They must have come here...

1636
02:14:26,893 --> 02:14:27,936
...hoping...

1637
02:14:28,186 --> 02:14:29,312
...beyond hope.

1638
02:14:39,072 --> 02:14:41,408
We could try to reach the mines.

1639
02:14:42,242 --> 02:14:44,494
We might last a few days.

1640
02:14:46,663 --> 02:14:47,706
No.

1641
02:14:50,667 --> 02:14:52,877
I will not die like this.

1642
02:14:54,254 --> 02:14:55,422
Cowering.

1643
02:14:56,298 --> 02:14:58,091
Clawing for breath.

1644
02:15:03,013 --> 02:15:04,139
We make for the forges.

1645
02:15:04,389 --> 02:15:06,349
He'll see us, sure as death.

1646
02:15:06,599 --> 02:15:07,851
Not if we split up.

1647
02:15:08,101 --> 02:15:08,685
Thorin...

1648
02:15:09,311 --> 02:15:10,812
...we'll never make it.

1649
02:15:11,062 --> 02:15:12,564
Some of us might.

1650
02:15:12,981 --> 02:15:15,191
Lead him to the forges.

1651
02:15:15,984 --> 02:15:17,986
We kill the dragon.

1652
02:15:19,696 --> 02:15:21,948
If this is to end in fire...

1653
02:15:22,407 --> 02:15:24,826
...then we will all burn together.

1654
02:15:26,119 --> 02:15:27,287
This way.

1655
02:15:31,750 --> 02:15:32,334
Flee.

1656
02:15:33,460 --> 02:15:34,377
Flee.

1657
02:15:35,378 --> 02:15:37,339
Run for your lives.

1658
02:15:38,089 --> 02:15:38,965
There is...

1659
02:15:39,591 --> 02:15:41,801
...nowhere to hide.

1660
02:15:42,052 --> 02:15:43,011
Behind you!

1661
02:15:43,261 --> 02:15:44,137
Worm!

1662
02:15:45,263 --> 02:15:45,930
Come on!

1663
02:15:48,308 --> 02:15:49,309
Run!

1664
02:15:51,269 --> 02:15:52,562
Hey, you!

1665
02:15:52,937 --> 02:15:53,605
Here!

1666
02:16:26,056 --> 02:16:28,786
Send word to Dol Guldur ...

1667
02:16:29,107 --> 02:16:31,980
... Oakenshield has reached the Mountain!

1668
02:16:42,419 --> 02:16:43,631
Go!

1669
02:16:44,132 --> 02:16:46,202
You! come with me.

1670
02:18:51,658 --> 02:18:53,618
This way. It's this way!

1671
02:18:53,868 --> 02:18:54,994
Come on!

1672
02:18:55,245 --> 02:18:55,828
Thorin!

1673
02:19:01,626 --> 02:19:02,710
Follow Balin!

1674
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:05,171
- Thorin.
- Come on!

1675
02:19:21,020 --> 02:19:22,355
Thorin!

1676
02:19:31,447 --> 02:19:32,490
Hold on!

1677
02:20:06,316 --> 02:20:07,650
Thorin!

1678
02:20:10,528 --> 02:20:12,071
Go. Go!

1679
02:20:15,825 --> 02:20:19,495
The plan's not gonna work.
These furnaces are stone cold.

1680
02:20:19,746 --> 02:20:21,080
He's right. We've no...

1681
02:20:21,331 --> 02:20:23,666
...fire hot enough to set them ablaze.

1682
02:20:26,210 --> 02:20:27,587
Have we not?

1683
02:20:29,130 --> 02:20:32,050
I did not look to see you so easily outwitted.

1684
02:20:36,012 --> 02:20:36,638
You have grown...

1685
02:20:36,888 --> 02:20:38,848
...slow and fat...

1686
02:20:39,682 --> 02:20:40,558
...in your dotage...

1687
02:20:43,019 --> 02:20:44,187
...slug!

1688
02:20:45,563 --> 02:20:47,231
Take cover. Go!

1689
02:21:14,676 --> 02:21:15,385
Bombur!

1690
02:21:15,677 --> 02:21:17,095
Get those bellows working.

1691
02:21:17,345 --> 02:21:18,429
Go!

1692
02:21:32,235 --> 02:21:32,819
Bilbo!

1693
02:21:33,069 --> 02:21:34,821
Up there. On my mark...

1694
02:21:35,071 --> 02:21:36,364
...pull that lever.

1695
02:21:46,874 --> 02:21:49,210
Balin! Can you still mix a flash-flame?

1696
02:21:49,460 --> 02:21:51,838
Aye. It'll only take a jiffy. Come on!

1697
02:21:53,589 --> 02:21:55,049
We don't have a jiffy.

1698
02:22:07,020 --> 02:22:08,146
Where's the sulfur?

1699
02:22:08,521 --> 02:22:09,355
<i>DORY.
You sure you know what...</i>

1700

1701
02:22:22,035 --> 02:22:22,827
Come on!

02:22:45,141 --> 02:22:45,808
NOW!

1703
02:24:42,550 --> 02:24:44,635
Lead him to the Gallery of the Kings.

1704
02:25:32,725 --> 02:25:33,851
Keep going, Bilbo!

1705
02:25:34,268 --> 02:25:35,353
Run!

1706
02:26:20,690 --> 02:26:21,691
You think you...

1707
02:26:21,941 --> 02:26:23,901
...can deceive me, Barrel-rider?

1708
02:26:27,446 --> 02:26:30,449
You have come from Lake-town.

1709
02:26:32,159 --> 02:26:33,452
This is some...

1710
02:26:33,703 --> 02:26:36,956
...sordid scheme hatched between
these filthy Dwarves...

1711
02:26:37,206 --> 02:26:40,376
...and those miserable
tub-trading Lakemen.

1712
02:26:41,377 --> 02:26:43,295
Those sniveling cowards...

1713
02:26:43,546 --> 02:26:45,006
...with their long bows...

1714
02:26:45,256 --> 02:26:48,092
...and Black Arrows.

1715
02:26:48,467 --> 02:26:50,344
Perhaps it is time...

1716
02:26:50,594 --> 02:26:52,471
...I paid them a visit.

1717
02:26:53,014 --> 02:26:54,265
Oh, no.

1718
02:26:56,142 --> 02:26:57,601
This isn't their fault!

1719
02:26:57,852 --> 02:26:58,644
Wait!

1720
02:26:58,894 --> 02:27:00,479
You cannot go to Lake-town!

1721
02:27:02,398 --> 02:27:04,567
You care about them...

1722
02:27:05,276 --> 02:27:06,527
you?

1723
02:27:06,777 --> 02:27:07,737
Good.

1724
02:27:08,446 --> 02:27:09,030
Then you can...

1725
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:10,865
...watch them die.

1726
02:27:16,412 --> 02:27:17,538
Here!

1727
02:27:18,456 --> 02:27:19,373
You witless worm.

1728
02:27:26,297 --> 02:27:27,673
You.

1729
02:27:28,090 --> 02:27:30,551
I am taking back what you stole.

1730
02:27:34,597 --> 02:27:35,264
You...

1731
02:27:35,514 --> 02:27:37,099
...will take nothing...

1732
02:27:37,350 --> 02:27:39,018
...from me...

1733
02:27:39,268 --> 02:27:40,436
...dwarf.

1734
02:27:40,936 --> 02:27:44,190
I laid low your warriors...

1735
02:27:44,440 --> 02:27:46,067
...of old.

1736
02:27:46,317 --> 02:27:48,694
I instilled terror in...

1737
02:27:48,944 --> 02:27:50,613
...the hearts of Men.

1738
02:27:51,781 --> 02:27:53,199
I am...

... Under the Mountain.

1741
02:27:57,578 --> 02:27:59,830
This is not your kingdom.

1742
02:28:00,081 --> 02:28:02,083
These are lands.

1743
02:28:02,833 --> 02:28:03,709
This is gold.

1744
02:28:06,170 --> 02:28:06,879
And we will...

1745
02:28:07,129 --> 02:28:09,298
...have our revenge.

Revenge?!

1749
02:29:35,926 --> 02:29:39,847
I will show you revenge!

1750
02:30:17,343 --> 02:30:18,385
Listen to me!

1751
02:30:18,928 --> 02:30:21,222
Do you not know what is coming?

1752
02:30:23,641 --> 02:30:27,353
I am fire.

1753
02:30:28,562 --> 02:30:31,065
I am...

1754
02:30:33,275 --> 02:30:34,610
...death.

1755
