1
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,220
<b>布里 - 夏尔边境</b>

2
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,790
<b>跃马旅店</b>

3
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,150
-小心点  -抱歉  亲爱的
<b>- Watch it! - Sorry, darling.</b>

4
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,020
-给  -谢谢
<b>- Here you are. - Thank you.</b>

5
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,870
我可以坐这吗
<b>Mind if I join you?</b>

6
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,160
和他的一样
<b>I'll have the same.</b>

7
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,790
自我介绍下  我叫甘道夫
<b>I should introduce myself. My name is Gandalf.</b>

8
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,330
灰袍巫师甘道夫
<b>Gandalf the Grey.</b>

9
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,240
我听说过你
<b>I know who you are.</b>

10
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,700
碰到你真巧
<b>Well, now, this is a fine chance.</b>

11
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,220
什么风把索林·橡木盾吹来了布里
<b>What brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?</b>

12
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,000
我收到消息
<b>I receive words</b>

13
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,580
有人看到我父亲在登兰德荒野游荡
<b>that my father have been seen wandering in the wilds near Dunland.</b>

14
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,810
我去找过  但一无所获
<b>I went looking, found no sign of him.</b>

15
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,130
索林  很久以来
<b>Thorin, it's been a long time since anything</b>

16
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,440
瑟莱因的消息都只是谣言
<b>but rumor was heard of Thrain.</b>

17
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,820
他还活着  我敢保证
<b>He still lives, I am sure of it.</b>

18
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,280
我父亲失踪前拜访过你
<b>My father came to see you before he went missing.</b>

19
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,190
你对他说了什么
<b>What did you say to him?</b>

20
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,240
我敦促他进军艾雷博
<b>I urged him to march upon Erebor.</b>

21
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,070
集合矮人的七支大军
<b>To gather the seven armies of dwarves.</b>

22
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,220
消灭恶龙  收复孤山
<b>To destroy the dragon and take back the Lonely Mountain.</b>

23
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:00,460
我也要同样敦促你  去收复家园
<b>And I would say the same to you, take back your homeland.</b>

24
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,770
你不是碰巧遇到我吧  甘道夫
<b>This is no chance meeting, is it, Gandalf?</b>

25
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,770
不
<b>No.</b>

26
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,850
不是
<b>It is not.</b>

27
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,370
孤山一直困扰着我  索林
<b>The Lonely Mountain troubles me, Thorin.</b>

28
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,900
恶龙盘踞得太久
<b>That dragon has sat there long enough.</b>

29
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,810
会引来更加邪恶的力量
<b>Sooner or later, darker minds will turn towards Erebor.</b>

30
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:28,000
我顺绿色大道南下时  遇到了些讨厌的生物
<b>I ran into some unsavory characters whilst travelling along Greenway.</b>

31
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,690
把我当成了流浪汉
<b>They mistook me for a vagabond.</b>

32
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,590
他们肯定后悔了
<b>I imagine they regreted that.</b>

33
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,890
他们还带了个信
<b>One of them was carrying a message.</b>

34
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,180
这是黑语言[魔多语]{fs}
<b>It is Black Speech.</b>

35
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,630
-这是悬赏  -悬赏什么
<b>- He promised as payment. - For what?</b>

36
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,290
你的人头
<b>Your head.</b>

37
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,150
有人想要你死
<b>Someone wants you dead.</b>

38
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,460
索林  你不能再等了
<b>Thorin, you could wait no longer,</b>

39
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,130
你是杜林王座的继承人
<b>you are the heir to the throne of Durin.</b>

40
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,680
召集矮人军队
<b>Unite the armies of the Dwarves.</b>

41
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,810
齐心协力  去夺回艾雷博
<b>Together you have the might and power to retake Erebor.</b>

42
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,510
召集七大矮人家族的会议
<b>Summon a meeting of the seven Dwarf families,</b>

43
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,770
要求他们信守誓言
<b>demand they stand by their oath.</b>

44
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,500
七大家族的军队
<b>The Seven Armies sworn an oath to the one</b>

45
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,220
只效忠手握阿肯宝钻的人
<b>who wields the King's Jewel, the Arkenstone.</b>

46
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,360
只有帝王珍宝才能联合他们
<b>It is the only thing that will unite them,</b>

47
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,700
而且  那宝石已经被斯矛革偷走了
<b>and in case you have forgotten, that jewel was stolen by Smaug.</b>

48
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,790
如果我帮助你找回它呢
<b>What if I were to help you reclaim it?</b>

49
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,310
怎么找  宝石远在半个中土世界之外
<b>How? The Arkenstone lies half a world away,</b>

50
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,860
在那只火龙的魔掌中
<b>buried beneath the feet of a fire-breathing dragon.</b>

51
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,520
对
<b>Yes.</b>

52
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,990
所以我们需要一个盗贼
<b>Which is why we're going to need a burglar.</b>

53
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,700
<b>12个月后</b>

54
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,230
-半兽人狼群有多远  -非常近
<b>- How close is the pack? - Too close.</b>

55
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,010
只有几里格
<b>Couple of leagues, no more.
一里格=3英里</b>

56
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,090
但还有更要命的
<b>But that's not the worst of it.</b>

57
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,410
他们会嗅到我们的气味的
<b>They will smell us, pick our scent.</b>

58
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,830
现在还没  不过迟早会的
<b>Not yet but they will do.</b>

59
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:52,950
我们还有别的麻烦
<b>We have another problem.</b>

60
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,220
他们看见你了吗
<b>Did they see you?</b>

61
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,270
-看见了你吗  -不  不是这个
<b>- They saw you? - No. That's not it.</b>

62
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,290
我怎么说的  安静得像只老鼠
<b>What did I tell you? Quiet as a mouse.</b>

63
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,990
天生是块盗贼的料
<b>Excellent burglar material.</b>

64
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,780
听我说  都听我说话
<b>Would you listen? Will you just listen?</b>

65
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,040
我要说的是  外面还有其他东西
<b>I'm trying to tell you there is something else out there.</b>

66
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,660
它什么样子  像头熊吗
<b>What form did it take, like a bear?</b>

67
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,540
对  但更大  大得多
<b>Yes, but bigger, much bigger.</b>

68
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,390
你认识那野兽吗
<b>You knew about this beast?</b>

69
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,020
我觉得应该原路返回
<b>I say we double back.</b>

70
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,090
那会被兽人追上的
<b>We will be run down by a pack of wolves.</b>

71
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,940
有栋房子  离这不远
<b>There is a house, it's not far from here,</b>

72
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,150
可供我们躲避
<b>where we might take refuge.</b>

73
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,580
谁的房子
<b>Whose house?</b>

74
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,290
-是敌是友  -都不是
<b>- A friend or foe? - Neither.</b>

75
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,590
他也许会帮助我们  也许会杀了我们
<b>He will help us, or, he will kill us.</b>

76
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,080
我们还有其他选择吗
<b>What choice do we have?</b>

77
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,730
没有
<b>None.</b>

78
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,560
这边  快跑
<b>This way, quickly!</b>

79
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,190
走
<b>Move!</b>

80
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,210
快点
<b>Come on.</b>

81
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,670
进房子里
<b>In the house!</b>

82
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,030
快跑
<b>Run!</b>

83
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,490
快点  进去
<b>Come on, get inside.</b>

84
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,120
打开门
<b>Open the door!</b>

85
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,330
快点
<b>Quickly.</b>

86
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,320
用力推
<b>Push!</b>

87
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,160
快点
<b>Come on!</b>

88
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,680
那是什么
<b>What is that?</b>

89
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,350
我们的房主
<b>That is our host.</b>

90
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,780
他叫贝荣
<b>His name is Beorn.</b>

91
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,150
他是个变形人
<b>And he's a skin-changer.</b>

92
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,230
有时是头壮硕的黑熊
<b>Sometimes he's a huge black bear,</b>

93
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,850
有时是个高大强壮的男人
<b>sometimes he's a great strong man.</b>

94
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,820
黑熊喜怒无常  但变成人  他还是讲道理的
<b>The bear is unpredictable, but the man can be reasoned with.</b>

95
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,000
不过  他不太喜欢矮人
<b>However, he's not over fond of Dwarves.</b>

96
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,300
-他走了  -离门远一点
<b>- He's leaving. - Come away from there!</b>

97
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,940
它不正常  这都不正常
<b>It's not natural, none of it!</b>

98
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,570
他肯定被黑魔法控制了
<b>It's obvious, he's under some dark spell.</b>

99
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,100
别犯傻  那是他自己的变形术
<b>Don't be a fool. He's under no enchantment but his own.</b>

100
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,020
好了  现在  大家休息吧
<b>All right, now. Get some sleep, all of you.</b>

101
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,450
今晚你们在这儿是安全的
<b>You'll be safe here tonight.</b>

102
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,810
但愿
<b>I hope.</b>

103
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,690
现在就进攻

104
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,110
趁矮人渣滓睡着时杀光他们

105
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,320
不

106
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,200
那头野兽在站岗

107
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,830
我们要在半路上截杀他们

108
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,390
大军正在多尔戈多集结

109
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:06,810
主人召见你

110
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,180
至尊戒  驭众戒
<b>Ash nazg durbatuluk</b>

111
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,230
至尊戒  寻众戒
<b>Ash nazg gimbatul</b>

112
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,690
至尊魔戒引众戒
<b>Ash nazg thrakatuluk</b>

113
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:16,140
黑暗之中锁众戒
<b>Agh burzum-ishi krimpatul</b>

114
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,980
我们人数日渐增长

115
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,000
力量日渐增强

116
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,710
你来统领军队吧

117
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,700
橡木盾怎么办

118
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,340
战火将至

119
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,480
你说我可以取他的人头

120
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,510
凡人终有一死

121
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,690
还要追杀他们吗

122
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,490
博格

123
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,630
我有任务给你

124
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,380
还想喝矮人的血吗

125
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,270
你就是那个橡木盾
<b>So you are the one they call Oakenshield.</b>

126
00:14:54,930 --> 00:15:00,470
告诉我  为什么亵渎者阿佐格要追杀你
<b>Tell me, why is Azorg the Defiler hunting you?</b>

127
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:04,010
你认识阿佐格  怎么回事
<b>You know of Azorg. How?</b>

128
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:07,500
我的族人最先在山中定居
<b>My people were the first to live in the mountains.</b>

129
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,420
远在兽人南下之前
<b>Before the Orcs came down from the north.</b>

130
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,540
亵渎者几乎杀光了我的家人
<b>The Defiler killed most of my family.</b>

131
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,620
只留了几个做奴隶
<b>But some he enslaved.</b>

132
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,510
不是做苦力  明白吗
<b>Not for work, you understand?</b>

133
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,060
是为了娱乐
<b>But for sport.</b>

134
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:28,670
他似乎觉得折磨变形人是种消遣
<b>Caging skin-changers and torturing them seemed to amuse him.</b>

135
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,850
还有像你这样的人吗
<b>There are others like you?</b>

136
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,930
曾经有很多
<b>Once there were many.</b>

137
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,170
现在呢
<b>And now?</b>

138
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,270
只剩一个了
<b>Now there's only one.</b>

139
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,360
你们要在秋天结束前抵达孤山
<b>You need to reach the mountain before the last days of autumn.</b>

140
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,680
对  在杜林之日前
<b>Before Durin's Day falls, yes.</b>

141
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,580
你们没多少时间了
<b>You're running out of time.</b>

142
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,120
所以我们必须穿过黑森林
<b>Which is why we must go through Mirkwood.</b>

143
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,960
有阴影笼罩着黑森林
<b>A darkness lies upon that forest.</b>

144
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,580
邪恶在林间滋生
<b>Foul things creep beneath those trees.</b>

145
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,090
墨瑞亚的兽人和多尔戈多的亡灵法师
<b>There is an alliance between the Orcs of Moria</b>

146
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:08,180
结成了同盟
<b>and the Necromancer in Dol Guldur.</b>

147
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,340
我不会冒险去那里  除非迫不得已
<b>I would not venture there, except in great need.</b>

148
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,020
我们走精灵之路  那里再安全不过
<b>We will take the Elven road. That path is too safe.</b>

149
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,360
安全
<b>Safe?</b>

150
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,660
木精灵与其他精灵不同
<b>The Wood-elves in Mirkwood are not like their kin.</b>

151
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,220
他们没那么睿智  却更加危险
<b>They're less wise and more dangerous.</b>

152
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,490
但这不重要
<b>But it matters not.</b>

153
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,450
什么意思
<b>What do you mean?</b>

154
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:34,110
这片土地到处都是兽人
<b>These lands are crawling with Orcs.</b>

155
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,660
他们的数量越来越多
<b>Their numbers are growing.</b>

156
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:42,730
你们徒步前行  永远到不了森林的
<b>And you're on foot, you will never reach the forest alive.</b>

157
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,480
我不喜欢矮人
<b>I don't like Dwarves.</b>

158
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,630
他们贪婪又盲目
<b>They are greedy, and blind.</b>

159
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,880
瞧不起他们眼中的劣等生物
<b>Blind to the lives of those they deem lesser than their own.</b>

160
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,060
但我更恨兽人
<b>But Orcs I hate more.</b>

161
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,140
你们需要什么
<b>What do you need?</b>

162
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,960
快走吧  趁着天色还早
<b>Go now, while you have the light.</b>

163
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,450
追杀你们的人就在后面
<b>Your hunters are not far behind.</b>

164
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,470
精灵之门
<b>The Elven Gate.</b>

165
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,750
这就是去往黑森林的路
<b>Here lies our path through Mirkwood.</b>

166
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:57,700
没有兽人的踪迹  算我们走运
<b>No sign of the Orcs. We have luck on our side.</b>

167
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:09,450
把马匹放走  让它们去找主人
<b>Set the ponies loose. Let them return to their master.</b>

168
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,480
这座森林好像
<b>This forest feels...</b>

169
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,710
病了
<b>sick.</b>

170
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,530
像是被疾病困扰
<b>As if there's a disease lies upon it.</b>

171
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,850
没有其他路可走了吗
<b>Is there no way around?</b>

172
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,670
除非往北走200英里  或往南走...
<b>Not unless we go to 200 miles north, or twice that distance...</b>

173
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,110
400英里
<b>south.</b>

174
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,610
阴影中有股力量蠢蠢欲动
<b>Something moves in the shadows unseen,</b>

175
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,580
躲避我们的耳目
<b>hidden from our sight.</b>

176
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,060
它的力量日渐强大
<b>Every day it grows in strength.</b>

177
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,270
小心那个亡灵法师
<b>Beware the Necromancer.</b>

178
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,270
他可不简单
<b>He's not what he seems.</b>

179
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,220
如果敌人归来了  一定要通知我
<b>If our enemy has returned, we must know.</b>

180
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,910
快去山中的戒灵坟墓
<b>Go to the tombs in the mountains.</b>

181
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,190
高丘
<b>The High Fells.</b>

182
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,650
好吧
<b>So be it.</b>

183
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,260
我还要骑马  等等
<b>Not my horse, I need it.</b>

184
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,960
你不是要离开吧
<b>You're not leaving us?</b>

185
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,580
我也是迫不得已
<b>I will not do this unless I had to.</b>

186
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:55,010
你变了  比尔博·巴金斯
<b>You've changed. Bilbo Baggins.</b>

187
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,390
不是离开夏尔时的那个霍比特了
<b>And not the same Hobbit as the one who left Shire.</b>

188
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,980
我本来想告诉你...
<b>I was going to tell you...</b>

189
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:14,080
我在半兽人的隧道里发现了一样东西
<b>I found something in the Goblin Tunnels.</b>

190
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,450
什么东西
<b>Found what?</b>

191
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,700
你发现了什么
<b>What did you find?</b>

192
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,810
我的勇气
<b>My courage.</b>

193
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,020
很好  很不错
<b>Good. Well that's good.</b>

194
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,660
你需要勇气
<b>You need it.</b>

195
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,280
我在艾雷博山前的瞭望角等你们
<b>I'll be waiting for you at the overlook before the slopes of Erebor.</b>

196
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,020
小心保管地图和钥匙
<b>Keep the map and key safe.</b>

197
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,340
不要擅自进入孤山
<b>Do not enter the Mountain without me.</b>

198
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,200
这可不是绿林
<b>This is not the Greenwood.</b>

199
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,050
森林的空气中充斥着幻象
<b>Although the very air of the forest is heavy</b>

200
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,190
侵蚀你们的意志
<b>with illusion that'll see to enter your mind...</b>

201
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,460
引你们误入歧途
<b>and lead you astray.</b>

202
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,080
误入歧途
<b>Lead us astray?</b>

203
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,810
那是什么意思
<b>What does that mean?</b>

204
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,860
必须沿着路走  不要离开
<b>You must stay on the path, do not leave it.</b>

205
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,450
否则就再也找不到路了
<b>If you do, you'll never find it again.</b>

206
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,850
不管发生什么  务必沿着路走
<b>No matter what may come, stay on the path!</b>

207
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,990
走吧  要在杜林之日的日落前赶到孤山
<b>Come on, we must reach the mountain before the sunset on Durin's Day.</b>

208
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,780
杜林之日
<b>Durin's Day?</b>

209
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,060
-走吧  -我们只有一次机会找到隐秘之门
<b>- Let's go. - We have one chance to find the hidden door .</b>

210
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,370
路往这边拐了
<b>The path goes this way.</b>

211
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,700
这边
<b>This way.</b>

212
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,990
空气  我需要空气
<b>Air. I need air.</b>

213
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,400
我的脑袋在打转  怎回事
<b>My head, it's spinning. What's happening?</b>

214
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,130
-继续走  -诺瑞
<b>- We're moving. - Nori.</b>

215
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,420
为什么停下来
<b>Why have we stopped?</b>

216
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,440
路径消失了
<b>The path, it's disappeared.</b>

217
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,220
怎么了
<b>What's going on?</b>

218
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,640
路不见了
<b>We've lost the path.</b>

219
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,050
那就找  大家一起找
<b>Find it. All of you, look! Look for the path!</b>

220
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,710
我不记得这地方  从来没见过
<b>I don't remember this place, none of it is familiar.</b>

221
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,860
在哪里
<b>Where is it?</b>

222
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,850
不知道  我们连这是哪都不知道
<b>We do not know. We do not even know what it is.</b>

223
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,460
看  烟草袋
<b>Look, a tobacco pouch.</b>

224
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,370
这森林里有矮人
<b>There's Dwarves in these woods.</b>

225
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,890
而且还是蓝山的矮人
<b>Dwarves in the Blue Mountains no less.</b>

226
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,090
这和我的烟草袋一模一样
<b>This is exactly the same as mine.</b>

227
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,550
因为就是你的
<b>Because it is yours.</b>

228
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:01,140
明白吗  我们在绕圈子  我们迷路了
<b>You understand? We are going round in circles, we are lost.</b>

229
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,950
我们没有迷路  我们在往东走
<b>We're not lost, we keep heading east.</b>

230
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,250
但哪面是东
<b>But which way is the east?</b>

231
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,190
我们看不见太阳
<b>We've lost the sun.</b>

232
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,530
太阳  要找到太阳
<b>The sun, we have to find the sun.</b>

233
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,650
在上面
<b>Up there.</b>

234
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,260
那是什么
<b>What's that?</b>

235
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,840
够了  都给我安静
<b>Enough! Quiet, all of you!</b>

236
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,840
有人在盯着我们
<b>We're being watched.</b>

237
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,020
我看见了湖
<b>I, I can see a lake.</b>

238
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,820
和一条河
<b>And a river,</b>

239
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,320
还有孤山
<b>and the Lonely Mountain.</b>

240
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,560
我们就快到了
<b>We're almost there.</b>

241
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,120
你们能听见吗
<b>Can you hear me?</b>

242
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,330
我知道路了
<b>I know which way to go.</b>

243
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,040
人呢
<b>Hello?</b>

244
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,580
有人吗
<b>Hello.</b>

245
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,010
不  别啊
<b>No, come on!</b>

246
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,390
赶紧吃  都跑不掉了
<b>Eat them now, none is running.</b>

247
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:56,450
他的皮很硬  里面肯定多汁
<b>His hide is tough, this could be juicy inside.</b>

248
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:58,760
杀了他
<b>Finish it.</b>

249
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,410
他还活着  你没杀掉他
<b>He's alive, you didn't kill him.</b>

250
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,910
赶紧杀了他
<b>Kill him now!</b>

251
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:10,370
开吃
<b>Feast!</b>

252
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,850
开吃
<b>Feast!</b>

253
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:21,880
什么东西
<b>What is it?</b>

254
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,920
不欺负你
<b>Fair terms, you see.</b>

255
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,380
只尝一小口
<b>Just a little taste.</b>

256
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:51,290
什么东西  在哪儿  在哪儿
<b>Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?</b>

257
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,280
在这里
<b>Here.</b>

258
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,940
刺到我了  疼死我了
<b>It stings, stings!</b>

259
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,310
刺
<b>Sting?</b>

260
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,570
这名字不错
<b>It's a good name.</b>

261
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,890
刺叮剑
<b>Sting.</b>

262
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,410
-我没事  -比尔博在哪儿
<b>- I'm all right. - Where's Bilbo?</b>

263
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,140
-比尔博  -我在上面
<b>- Bilbo. - I'm up here.</b>

264
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,120
拉
<b>Haul!</b>

265
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,420
在哪儿  到哪儿去了  掉哪儿去了
<b>Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?</b>

266
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,700
不
<b>No!</b>

267
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,530
格罗因  奇力
<b>Gloin! Kili!</b>

268
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,000
杀光它们
<b>Kill them all!</b>

269
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,250
奇力
<b>Kili!</b>

270
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,040
是我的
<b>Mine.</b>

271
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,630
快  跟上
<b>Come on, keep up!</b>

272
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,730
别以为我不会下杀手  矮人
<b>Do not think I will not kill you, Dwarf.</b>

273
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,710
我乐意之极
<b>It would be my pleasure.</b>

274
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,530
-不  -奇力
<b>- No! - Kili!</b>

275
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,620
把你的匕首扔给我
<b>Throw me your dagger!</b>

276
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,280
快点
<b>Quick!</b>

277
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,750
你以为我会给你武器吗  矮人
<b>Did you think I'm giving you a weapon, Dwarf?</b>

278
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,420
你想错了
<b>You're mistaken!</b>

279
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,220
搜身
<b>Search them.</b>

280
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,920
还给我  这是私人物品
<b>Hey, give it back, that's private!</b>

281
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,240
这是谁  你的弟弟吗
<b>Who is this? your brother?</b>

282
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,630
那是我老婆
<b>That is my wife!</b>

283
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:21,050
这长得像半兽人的是谁  这么丑
<b>And what is this horrid creature, a Goblin-mutant?</b>

284
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,490
那是我家儿子  金雳
<b>That's my wee lad, Gimli!
指环王三部曲中的矮人战士  后与莱戈拉斯成为挚友</b>

285
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,650
蜘蛛都死了吗

286
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,380
是的  但还会有的

287
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,490
它们越来越放肆了

288
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:48,090
这是上古精灵宝剑

289
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:53,130
我的族人打造的

290
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,320
你从哪得到的
<b>Where did you get this?</b>

291
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,130
别人送的
<b>It was given to me.</b>

292
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:04,810
不但是个贼  还是个骗子
<b>Not just a thief but a liar as well.</b>

293
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,610
<i>带他们走
<b>Enwenno hain!</i></b>

294
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,530
索林  比尔博去哪了
<b>Thorin, where's Bilbo?</b>

295
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,080
关上大门

296
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:16,870
跟你们没完
<b>This is not the end of it!</b>

297
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,440
你不来搜我的身吗
<b>Aren't you going to search me?</b>

298
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,200
我裤裆里可能什么都有哦
<b>I could have anything down my trousers.</b>

299
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,280
或是什么都没有
<b>Or nothing.</b>

300
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:48,540
那矮人为什么盯着你看  塔睿尔

301
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,660
谁知道

302
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:54,420
他倒是个挺高的矮人

303
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,320
你说呢

304
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,290
是比一般的矮人高

305
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,090
但还是一样丑

306
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,750
放弃吧
<b>Leave it!</b>

307
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:17,760
逃不出去的  这不是半兽人的地牢
<b>There is no way out, this is no Orc dungeon.</b>

308
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,450
这里是林地王国的牢房
<b>These are holes of the Woodland Realm.</b>

309
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:24,660
没有国王的恩准  谁也不出去
<b>No one leaves here but by the King's consent.</b>

310
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,070
有人觉得这是什么崇高的使命
<b>Some imagine that a noble quest is at hand.</b>

311
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:38,860
收复家园  消灭恶龙
<b>A quest to reclaim a homeland, and slay a dragon.</b>

312
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,250
但我觉得你们没有这么高尚
<b>I myself suspect a more prosiac motive.</b>

313
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:49,260
你们只能干偷鸡摸狗的勾当
<b>Attempted burglary or something of that ilk.</b>

314
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,380
你找到了进山的方法
<b>You have found a way in.</b>

315
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:58,900
你在找能赋予你王权的宝物
<b>You seek that which would bestow upon you, the right to rule.</b>

316
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,410
帝王珍宝
<b>The King's Jewel.</b>

317
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,250
阿肯宝钻
<b>The Arkenstone.</b>

318
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:09,140
在你眼中是无价之宝
<b>It is precious to you beyond measure.</b>

319
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,290
我能够理解
<b>I understand that.</b>

320
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:16,750
山中众多宝石  我也觊觎已久
<b>The gems in the Mountain that I, too, desire...</b>

321
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:21,320
白色的宝石  如同纯洁的星光
<b>White gems, a pure starlight.</b>

322
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,680
我可以帮你
<b>I offer you my help.</b>

323
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:28,730
请说吧
<b>I'm listening.</b>

324
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,010
我会放你们走
<b>I would let you go,</b>

325
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,760
但要把我的财宝还给我
<b>if you but return what is mine.</b>

326
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,710
公平交换
<b>A favor for a favor.</b>

327
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:44,420
王者之间的约定
<b>Have my word, one king to another.</b>

328
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:52,240
哪怕世界毁灭
<b>I would not trust Thranduil,</b>

329
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:57,860
我也不会相信瑟兰迪尔  这位国王的承诺
<b>a great king to honor his words till the end of all days be upon us.</b>

330
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,790
你不值得信任
<b>You lack all honor!</b>

331
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,410
我看到过你怎样对待盟友
<b>I've seen how you treat your friends.</b>

332
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,820
我们找到你
<b>We came to you once,</b>

333
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,180
饥肠辘辘  无家可归  渴求你的帮助
<b>starving, homeless , seeking your help.</b>

334
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,630
你却袖手旁观
<b>But you turned your back.</b>

335
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:17,710
你转身离去  让我的人民饱受煎熬
<b>You turned away from the suffering of my people.</b>

336
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,210
面对毁灭家园的地狱之火
<b>The inferno that destroyed us.</b>

337
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,710
<i>葬身火海
<b>Imrid amrad ursul!</i></b>

338
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,730
不要跟我说龙火
<b>Do not talk to me of dragon fire.</b>

339
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:28,590
我体会过它的力量
<b>I know its wrath and ruin.</b>

340
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,180
我也斗过北方的恶龙
<b>I have faced the great serpents of the north.</b>

341
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:43,380
我警告过你的祖父  他的贪婪必会引来恶果
<b>I warned your grandfather of what his greed would summon.</b>

342
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,290
但他充耳不闻
<b>But he would not listen.</b>

343
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,020
你和他一样
<b>You are just like him.</b>

344
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,000
在这里待到尸骨无存吧
<b>Stay here if you will, and rot.</b>

345
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:03,610
100年对精灵来说  只是一瞬间
<b>100 years is a mere blink in the life of an Elf.</b>

346
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:08,260
我有的是耐心  我会等的
<b>I am patient. I can wait.</b>

347
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,370
-他向你提条件了吗  -提了
<b>- Did he offer you a deal? - He did.</b>

348
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:23,850
我<i>唾弃了他的先祖</i>
<b>I told him he can go <i>ish kakhfê ai'd dur rugnu!</i></b>

349
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,110
还有他的族人们
<b>Him and all his kin!</b>

350
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:28,980
好吧
<b>That's that, then.</b>

351
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,170
那是我们唯一的希望了
<b>The deal was our only hope.</b>

352
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,180
还不是唯一的
<b>Not our only hope.</b>

353
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,580
我知道你在那
<b>I know you're there.</b>

354
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:51,390
为什么要在阴影中徘徊
<b>Why do you linger in the shadows?</b>

355
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,650
我是来向您报告的
<b>I was coming to report to you.</b>

356
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,800
我两日前就下令要你摧毁那个巢穴了吧
<b>I thought I ordered that nest to be destroyed not 2 moons past.</b>

357
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,010
森林已经扫荡过了  主上
<b>We cleared the forest as ordered, my lord.</b>

358
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,520
但还有蜘蛛不断从南边涌入
<b>But more spiders keep coming up from the south.</b>

359
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,590
他们在多尔戈多的废墟中繁殖
<b>They are spawning in the ruins of Dol Guldur.</b>

360
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,230
如果能从源头上扼制住他们
<b>If we could kill them at their source...</b>

361
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:10,530
他们的堡垒远在边界之外
<b>The fortress lies beyond our borders.</b>

362
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,470
避免邪恶生物侵入我们的领土
<b>Keep our lands clear of those foul creatures.</b>

363
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,820
这才是你的工作
<b>That is your task.</b>

364
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,140
就算赶跑了又怎样
<b>And when we drive them off? What then?</b>

365
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,320
他们难道不会跑到其他地方去吗
<b>Will they not spread to other lands?</b>

366
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,390
其他地方不关我的事
<b>Other lands are not my concern.</b>

367
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:24,720
外面的世界潮起潮落
<b>Fortunes of the world will rise and fall.</b>

368
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,870
只有我们的国度永在
<b>But here in this kingdom, we will endure.</b>

369
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,340
莱戈拉斯说你今天非常英勇
<b>Legolas said you fought well today.</b>

370
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,080
他对你是渐生好感
<b>He's grown very fond of you.</b>

371
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,370
我向您保证  主上
<b>I assure you, my lord.</b>

372
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,820
在他眼里  我只不过是个卫队长
<b>Legolas thinks of me as no more than a captain of the guard.</b>

373
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,640
也许以前是
<b>Perhaps he did once.</b>

374
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,340
现在可不一定了
<b>Now I'm not so sure.</b>

375
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,740
我想您不会允许自己的儿子
<b>I do not think you would allow your son</b>

376
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,150
对出身卑微的木精灵有好感吧
<b>to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan Elf.</b>

377
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,560
没错  我不会允许
<b>No, you're right. I would not.</b>

378
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,890
但他还是很在乎你
<b>Still, he cares about you.</b>

379
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,830
没有希望  就不要让他幻想
<b>Do not give him hope where there is none.</b>

380
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,700
门口有人守卫

381
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:24,920
他们人数不足  跟我来

382
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:33,340
<b>归来吧  innikh dê</b>

383
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:53,840
你手里的那枚石头是什么
<b>The stone in your hand, what is it?</b>

384
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,460
是个护身符
<b>It is a talisman.</b>

385
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:02,720
上面刻着强大的咒语
<b>A powerful spell lies upon it,</b>

386
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,050
只要不是矮人  看到咒语
<b>if any but a Dwarf reads the runes on this stone...</b>

387
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,250
就会受到永恒的诅咒
<b>They will be forever cursed.</b>

388
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,860
也没准
<b>Or not.</b>

389
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,780
信则灵  不信则不灵
<b>Depending on whether you believe.</b>

390
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,310
这种东西只是个象征
<b>This kind of thing is just a token.</b>

391
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,520
符文石
<b>A rune stone.</b>

392
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,630
我妈妈给我的  好让我记得承诺
<b>My mother gave it to me so I'd remember my promise.</b>

393
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:31,620
什么承诺
<b>What promise?</b>

394
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:33,720
我会回到她身边
<b>That I would come back to her.</b>

395
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,720
她很担心
<b>She worries.</b>

396
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,670
她觉得我很鲁莽
<b>She thinks I'm reckless.</b>

397
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:42,630
是吗
<b>Are you?</b>

398
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:59,700
好盛大的宴会
<b>Sounds like quite a party having out there.</b>

399
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,200
那是<i>星光盛宴</i>
<b>It is <i>mereth en gilith</i>.</b>

400
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,960
在星光下的晚宴
<b>The feast of starlight.</b>

401
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,360
<i>精灵</i>认为光都是神圣的
<b>All light is sacred to the <i>Eldar</i>.</b>

402
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:12,350
但木精灵最爱的是星光
<b>But Wood Elves love best for light of the stars.</b>

403
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:15,690
我一直觉得星光是清冷的
<b>I always thought it is a cold light.</b>

404
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,020
遥不可及
<b>Remote and far away.</b>

405
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:21,980
那是回忆
<b>It is memory.</b>

406
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,160
纯洁宝贵
<b>Precious and pure.</b>

407
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,310
像你的承诺一样
<b>Like your promise.</b>

408
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:42,640
我上去过几次
<b>I have walked there sometimes.</b>

409
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:46,090
森林上面  深入夜色
<b>Beyond the forest and up into the night.</b>

410
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,440
远远地看着整个世界
<b>I have seen the world full away.</b>

411
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:54,620
夜空中充满了白色的光辉
<b>And the white light forever fill the air.</b>

412
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:00,280
我见过一次焰月
<b>I saw fire moon once.</b>

413
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,940
在登兰德附近的路上
<b>The roads of the path near Dunland.</b>

414
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:07,050
巨大的月亮  火红金灿的光芒
<b>Huge, red and golden it was, filled the sky.</b>

415
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:11,050
我们当时护送一批梅督林的商人
<b>We were an escort for some merchants in Mindolluin,</b>

416
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:14,000
他们用银器换皮毛
<b>they were trading in silver work for furs.</b>

417
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,720
我们沿着绿色大道南下
<b>We took the Greenway south.</b>

418
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:18,330
山一直在我们左侧
<b>Keeping the mountain to our left.</b>

419
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,160
日暮之后
<b>At the end of the day,</b>

420
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,380
一轮巨大的焰月  照亮我们的路
<b>you see huge fire moon lighting our path.</b>

421
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,630
我们的酒快喝完了
<b>We're running out of drink.</b>

422
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,880
这些空酒桶早就该送回埃加洛斯了
<b>These empty barrels should be sent back to Esgaroth hours ago.</b>

423
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,570
驳船工肯定在等了
<b>Bargeman would be waiting for them.</b>

424
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:37,950
随你怎么说
<b>Say what you like,</b>

425
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:41,430
咱的臭脾气国王藏的美酒不能放过
<b>but the ill-tempered king has this excellent, tasty wine.</b>

426
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,920
-来吧  罗斯 尝一下  -我还要看管矮人呢
<b>- Come on, Ross, try it. - I have the Dwarves in my charge.</b>

427
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:49,760
都被锁起来了  还能跑到哪去
<b>They're locked up, where can they go?</b>

428
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,850
我敢打赌就要日出了  肯定快到黎明了
<b>I'll wager the sun is on the rise. Must be nearly dawn.</b>

429
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,850
我们是不是永远都到不了孤山了
<b>We never gonna reach the mountain, are we?</b>

430
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,500
关在这里怎么去孤山
<b>Not stuck in here, you know?</b>

431
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:12,800
比尔博
<b>Bilbo.</b>

432
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,650
附近有卫兵
<b>There are guards nearby.</b>

433
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:38,690
这是什么
<b>What's this?</b>

434
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:39,590
你先走
<b>You first.</b>

435
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,090
-欧瑞  -不是那边  在下面  跟我来
<b>- Ori. - Not that way. Down here, follow me!</b>

436
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:01,700
这边
<b>This way.</b>

437
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:07,810
-快来  -我们居然跑到酒窖来了
<b>- Come. - I don't believe we're in the cellars!</b>

438
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,040
你应该带我们找出去的路
<b>You're supposed to be leading us out now for the road!</b>

439
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,300
我脑子清楚得很
<b>I know what I'm doing.</b>

440
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:13,460
这边
<b>This way.</b>

441
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,520
所有人  快进酒桶  快点
<b>Everyone, climb into the barrels, quickly!</b>

442
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,530
你疯了吗  他们会发现我们的
<b>Are you mad? They'll find us.</b>

443
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,220
不  不  不会的  我保证
<b>No, no, they won't. I promise you!</b>

444
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:28,280
拜托  一定要相信我
<b>Please, please, you must trust me!</b>

445
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,130
按他说的做
<b>Do as he says.</b>

446
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:53,960
我们现在该干什么
<b>What do we do now?</b>

447
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,330
屏住呼吸
<b>Hold your breath.</b>

448
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,180
屏住呼吸  什么意思
<b>Hold my breath? What do you mean?</b>

449
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,740
钥匙在谁手里
<b>Where is the keeper of the keys?</b>

450
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:54,540
欢迎  巴金斯大师
<b>Welcome, Master Baggins.</b>

451
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,350
快点  出发了
<b>Come on, let's go.</b>

452
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:09,190
抓稳了
<b>Hold on!</b>

453
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,230
比尔博
<b>Bilbo!</b>

454
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:28,730
坚持住
<b>Hang on.</b>

455
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,620
不  救命啊
<b>No. Help!</b>

456
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:38,550
关闸门

457
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,020
不要
<b>No!</b>

458
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:12,910
小心
<b>Watch out!</b>

459
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:32,620
全杀光

460
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,940
去桥上
<b>Get on to the bridge!</b>

461
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,180
奇力
<b>Kili?</b>

462
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:22,090
奇力
<b>Kili?</b>

463
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:39,590
杀了她  杀了那个母精灵

464
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,720
追上他们

465
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:16,750
奇力
<b>Kili?</b>

466
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,490
诺瑞
<b>Nori!</b>

467
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:55,420
一起来
<b>Come along!</b>

468
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,470
邦伯
<b>Bombur!</b>

469
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,060
等等

470
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:47,720
不要杀他

471
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,700
追上去  拦住他们

472
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,470
是你啊
<b>Oh, it's you.</b>

473
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,090
为什么要我来这  甘道夫
<b>Why am I here, Gandalf?</b>

474
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,600
相信我  瑞达加斯特
<b>Trust me, Radagast.</b>

475
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,340
我不会无缘无故叫你来的
<b>I would not have called you here without a good reason.</b>

476
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:53,810
这里不适合见面
<b>This is not a nice place to meet.</b>

477
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:57,340
的确不适合
<b>No. It is not.</b>

478
00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:01,100
这里都是黑魔法  甘道夫
<b>These are dark spells, Gandalf.</b>

479
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,910
怨气很重  古老的黑魔法
<b>Old, and full of hate.</b>

480
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,740
这里埋的是谁
<b>Who's buried here?</b>

481
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:09,400
就算他有名字  也早被人遗忘了
<b>If he had name, it's long since been lost.</b>

482
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:13,850
人们只会记得他是恶魔的仆从
<b>He would have been known only as a servant of evil.</b>

483
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:24,650
九个戒灵之一
<b>One of nine.</b>

484
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:30,500
为什么是现在  甘道夫  我不明白
<b>Why now, Gandalf? I don't understand.</b>

485
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,040
戒灵被召唤到了多尔戈多
<b>The Ring-wraiths is summoned to Dol Guldur.</b>

486
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,250
但不可能是亡灵法师
<b>But it can not be the Necromancer.</b>

487
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:38,790
人类不可能召唤出这么邪恶的东西
<b>A human sorcerer could not summon such evil.</b>

488
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,970
谁说他是人类
<b>Who said it was human?</b>

489
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:46,110
九个戒灵只效忠一人
<b>The Nine only answer to one master.</b>

490
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:48,980
我们没有注意到  瑞达加斯特
<b>We've been blind, Radagast.</b>

491
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,990
敌人趁我们不备  卷土重来了
<b>And in our blindness the enemy has returned.</b>

492
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:58,190
他在召集他的仆从
<b>He's summoning his servants.</b>

493
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:03,150
亵渎者阿佐格可不是普通的猎手
<b>Azorg the Defiler is no ordinary hunter.</b>

494
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:07,220
他是个指挥官  军团指挥官
<b>He's a commander, a commander of legions.</b>

495
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,630
敌人要发动战争
<b>The enemy is preparing for war.</b>

496
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:17,200
从东边起  他盯上了孤山
<b>It will begin in the east. His mind is set upon that mountain.</b>

497
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:18,490
你要去哪
<b>Where are you going?</b>

498
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:20,510
-和其他人汇合  -甘道夫
<b>- To rejoin the others. - Gandalf.</b>

499
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:24,460
是我牵的头  我不能抛弃他们
<b>I started this, I can not forsake them.</b>

500
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:26,430
他们危在旦夕了
<b>They are in grave danger.</b>

501
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:27,960
如果你说的是真的
<b>If what you say is true...</b>

502
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:31,250
整个世界都危在旦夕了
<b>the world is in grave danger.</b>

503
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,980
他藏在堡垒中积蓄力量
<b>The power in that fortress will only grow stronger.</b>

504
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:40,080
你想让我把朋友们抛到一旁
<b>You want me to cast my friends aside.</b>

505
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,000
-还有人追吗  -我看没有了
<b>- Anything behind us? - Not that I can see.</b>

506
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:52,470
应该甩掉兽人了
<b>I think we've outrun the Orcs.</b>

507
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,340
只能逃一时
<b>Not for long.</b>

508
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:55,740
这里水流太缓
<b>We've lost the current.</b>

509
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,820
大家上岸  来吧  我们走
<b>Make for the shore. Come on, let's go.</b>

510
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:07,280
加油
<b>Come on.</b>

511
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,720
我没事  小伤而已
<b>I'm fine. It's nothing.</b>

512
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,580
-走起来  -奇力受伤了  腿需要包扎
<b>- On your feet. - Kili's wounded, his leg needs binding.</b>

513
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:28,380
有一队兽人跟在我们后面  得赶紧走了
<b>There's an Orc pack on our tail. We keep moving.</b>

514
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:31,020
-去哪  -去孤山  我们很近了
<b>- To where? - To the mountain, we're so close.</b>

515
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,660
中间隔着一座湖呢
<b>A lake lies between us and that mountain.</b>

516
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:36,440
我们没有办法渡湖
<b>We have no way to cross it.</b>

517
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:40,120
-那我们就绕过去  -兽人肯定会追上来
<b>- So then we go arround. - The Orcs'll run us down, as sure as daylight.</b>

518
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:42,910
我们也没有防身的武器
<b>We have no weapon to defend ourselves.</b>

519
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:46,750
快包扎他的腿  给你两分钟时间
<b>Bind his legs quickly. You have 2 minutes.</b>

520
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:10,460
我不会再手下留情了
<b>Do it again...and you're dead.</b>

521
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:15,960
不好意思  你是从长湖城来的
<b>Excuse me, but, um...you're from Lake-town,</b>

522
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,260
我没看错吧
<b>if I'm not mistaken?</b>

523
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:20,410
那边的驳船
<b>That barge over there,</b>

524
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:24,300
有没有可能租给我们
<b>is it available for hire by any chance?</b>

525
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,110
你为什么觉得我会帮你们
<b>What makes you think I would help you?</b>

526
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,860
从靴子看  你过的日子挺苦
<b>Those boots have seen better days.</b>

527
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,390
从大衣看也是
<b>As has that coat.</b>

528
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:35,700
想必你还要养家糊口吧
<b>No doubt you have some hungry mouths to feed.</b>

529
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:38,070
几个孩子
<b>How many bearings?</b>

530
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,480
一个男孩两个女孩
<b>A boy and two girls.</b>

531
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:43,920
我猜你妻子肯定是个大美人
<b>And your wife, I imagine she's a beauty.</b>

532
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:48,130
对  曾经是
<b>Aye, she was.</b>

533
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:52,680
对不起  我不是故意的
<b>I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...</b>

534
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:56,050
得了  得了  客套个什么劲
<b>Come on, come on. Enough for the niceties!</b>

535
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,750
你着什么急
<b>What's your hurry?</b>

536
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:59,020
关你什么事
<b>What's it to you?</b>

537
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:01,150
我想知道你们是什么人
<b>I would like to know who you are.</b>

538
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:03,800
又在这里做些什么事情
<b>And what you are doing in these lands.</b>

539
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,860
我们是从蓝山来的商人
<b>We are simple merchants from the Blue Mountains.</b>

540
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:10,250
要去铁丘陵走亲戚
<b>Journeying to see our kin in the Iron Hills.</b>

541
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,460
你们说是普通商人
<b>Simple merchants you say.</b>

542
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:17,200
我们需要食物  补给和武器
<b>We need food, supplies, weapons.</b>

543
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:18,740
你能帮忙吗
<b>Can you help us?</b>

544
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,580
我知道这些木桶是哪来的
<b>I know where these barrels came from.</b>

545
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:27,350
怎么了
<b>What of it?</b>

546
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,140
我不知道你们和精灵之间发生了什么
<b>I don't know what business you had with the Elves.</b>

547
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:32,610
但我觉得结果不太妙
<b>But I don't think it ended well.</b>

548
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:36,830
除非城主带路  没有人进得了长湖城
<b>No one enters Lake-town but by lead of The Master.</b>

549
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:40,620
他的收入全靠和林地王国的交易
<b>All his wealth comes from trades with the Woodland Realm.</b>

550
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,550
他肯定会把你们扔进牢房
<b>He would see you in irons</b>

551
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:44,330
不敢招惹瑟兰迪尔国王
<b>before risking the wraith of king Thranduil.</b>

552
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:52,230
我打赌肯定有悄悄进城的方法
<b>I'll wager there are ways to enter that town unseen.</b>

553
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,170
对
<b>Aye.</b>

554
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:59,420
但要有个走私贩帮忙
<b>But for that, you would need a smuggler.</b>

555
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,510
我们会付钱的  双倍
<b>For which we will pay, double.</b>

556
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:12,470
邪恶就是如此愚蠢
<b>Such is the nature of evil.</b>

557
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:18,030
即使遍布中土  依旧闭塞盲目
<b>Out there in the vast ignorance of the world it festers and spreads.</b>

558
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:21,050
有阴影在黑暗中成长
<b>A shadow that grows in the dark.</b>

559
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:23,110
那恶灵昼夜不休
<b>A sleepless malice</b>

560
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:26,420
如夜幕一般黑暗
<b>as black as the oncoming wall of night.</b>

561
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:32,360
之前是这样  以后也永远会这样
<b>So it ever was. So will it always be.</b>

562
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:37,470
最后  所有的邪恶都会现身
<b>In time, all foul things come forth.</b>

563
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:40,540
你们在追杀13个矮人
<b>You were tracking a company of 13 Dwarves.</b>

564
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:41,590
为什么
<b>Why?</b>

565
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:43,070
不是13个
<b>Not 13.</b>

566
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:44,710
不再是了
<b>Not any more.</b>

567
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,970
那个年轻人  黑头发的弓箭手
<b>The young one, the black-haired archer.</b>

568
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:52,160
他中了魔窟的箭
<b>We stuck him of a Morgul shaft.</b>

569
01:02:53,230 --> 01:02:57,960
毒液渗入血液  他活不长了
<b>Poison is in his blood, he'll be choking on it soon.</b>

570
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:00,320
回答问题  渣滓
<b>Answer the question, filth.</b>

571
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:03,170
狗没有权利问我问题  母精灵

572
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:07,930
最好别惹怒她
<b>I would not antagonize her.</b>

573
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:10,080
你喜欢杀戮吗  兽人
<b>You like killing things, Orc?</b>

574
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:12,340
你喜欢死亡吗
<b>You like death?</b>

575
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,060
那就让你尝尝死亡的滋味
<b>Then let me give it to you!</b>

576
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:16,220
够了

577
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:18,430
塔睿尔  走开

578
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,230
马上

579
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:35,260
我不在乎矮人的死活  回答我的问题
<b>I do not care about one dead Dwarf. Answer the question.</b>

580
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:37,020
没什么好害怕的
<b>You have nothing to fear.</b>

581
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:41,550
把知道的都说出来  我就放你自由
<b>Tell us what you know and I will set you free.</b>

582
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:44,530
有人要杀死他们  为什么
<b>You had orders to kill them, Why?</b>

583
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:47,020
索林·橡木盾对你们有什么用
<b>What is Thorin Oakenshield to you?</b>

584
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:50,430
那个矮冬瓜永远别想当国王
<b>The Dwarf runt will never be king.</b>

585
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:52,700
国王吗  没有山下之王
<b>King? There's no King Under the Mountain.</b>

586
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:57,260
将来也不会有  只要那头龙还活着
<b>Nor will there ever be. None would they enter Erebor</b>

587
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:58,730
没人进得去艾雷博
<b>whilst the dragon lives.</b>

588
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:00,470
你知道什么
<b>You know nothing.</b>

589
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:03,300
你们的世界将化为火海
<b>Your world will burn.</b>

590
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:04,980
你在说什么
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

591
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,720
快说
<b>Speak!</b>

592
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,910
我们的时代又回来了
<b>Our time has come again.</b>

593
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:14,470
我的主人效忠于他
<b>My master serves the One.</b>

594
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:20,130
现在明白了吧  精灵  死亡就要到来了
<b>Do you understand now, Elfling? Death is upon you.</b>

595
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:24,710
战火就要蔓延到这了
<b>The flames of war are upon you.</b>

596
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:28,530
你为什么这么做
<b>Why did you do that?</b>

597
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:30,400
你说过要放他自由
<b>You promised to set him free.</b>

598
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,190
我照做了
<b>And I did.</b>

599
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:36,890
我解放了他那卑鄙的头颅
<b>I freed his wretched head from his miserable shoulders.</b>

600
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,530
这兽人嘴里还能套出话来
<b>There was more the Orc could tell us.</b>

601
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:43,300
我觉得没什么价值了
<b>There was nothing more he could tell me.</b>

602
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:46,680
他说的战火是什么意思
<b>What did he mean by the flames of war?</b>

603
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:49,800
他们要使用什么武器
<b>It means they intend to unleash a weapon</b>

604
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,880
这武器强大到可以毁灭一切
<b>so great it will destroy all before it.</b>

605
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:56,140
边境  道路和河流的守卫通通加倍
<b>I want the watch doubled at our borders, all roads, all rivers.</b>

606
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:58,300
一有动静  立即禀报
<b>Nothing moves that I hear of it.</b>

607
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:02,710
严禁任何人进出
<b>No one enters this kingdom, and no one leaves it.</b>

608
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:07,400
关闭城门

609
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:10,970
国王下令封城

610
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:12,840
那塔睿尔怎么办

611
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:16,980
她怎么了

612
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:18,450
她带着弓箭和匕首

613
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:21,210
跑进森林里去了

614
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:23,220
还没有回来

615
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,840
矮人的血

616
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,380
他们经过这里

617
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:53,680
还有另一股味道

618
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,290
是人肉

619
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:06,360
他们找到渡湖的方法了

620
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:29,210
小心点
<b>Watch out!</b>

621
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,510
你干什么  想淹死我们吗
<b>What are you trying to do? Drown us?</b>

622
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:43,200
这片水域生养了我  矮人老爷
<b>I was born and bred on these waters , master Dwarf.</b>

623
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:46,700
就算我想淹死你们  也不会选这里
<b>If I wanted to drown you, I would not do it here.</b>

624
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:51,300
我受够这个长湖城的滑头了
<b>Oh, I've had enough of this slippy lake-man.</b>

625
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:54,100
要我说直接丢掉他  甩了他
<b>I say we throw him over the sail and then we dump him.</b>

626
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,450
巴德  他叫巴德
<b>Bard, his name is Bard.</b>

627
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:57,380
你怎么知道的
<b>How do you know?</b>

628
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,000
我问的
<b>Um, I asked him.</b>

629
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,030
我才不管他叫什么  我不喜欢他
<b>I don't care what he calls himself, I don't like him.</b>

630
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:05,570
我们不需要喜欢他  付钱给他就行
<b>We do not have to like him. We simply have to pay him.</b>

631
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:08,560
来吧伙计  钱都拿出来
<b>Come now lads, turn out your pockets.</b>

632
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:11,600
我们怎么知道他不会背叛我们
<b>How do we know he won't betray us?</b>

633
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:12,900
不知道
<b>We don't.</b>

634
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:16,600
还有个大问题
<b>There's um, still a big problem.</b>

635
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:19,100
还差10枚银币
<b>We're 10 coins short.</b>

636
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:25,230
葛罗音  快点  把你的钱拿出来
<b>Gloin, come on. Give us what you have.</b>

637
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:26,830
找我干什么
<b>Don't look to me.</b>

638
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,990
这次冒险弄得我倾家荡产
<b>I've been bled dry by this venture.</b>

639
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:34,020
一点回报都没见到
<b>What have I seen from my investment?</b>

640
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:37,820
什么都没有  只有痛苦和悲伤
<b>Naught but misery and grief and...</b>

641
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,880
老天爷啊
<b>Bless my beard.</b>

642
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:51,750
拿去  全都拿走
<b>Take it, take all of it.</b>

643
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,650
钱呢  快点给我
<b>The money, quick, give it to me.</b>

644
01:07:57,650 --> 01:07:59,420
拿到供给之后自然会付你钱
<b>We will pay you when we get our provisions,</b>

645
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:00,150
否则不行
<b>but not before.</b>

646
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:02,860
不想被关进大牢  就听我的
<b>If you value your freedom, you'll do as I say.</b>

647
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:04,840
前面有守卫
<b>There are guards ahead.</b>

648
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,220
他在干什么
<b>What's he doing?</b>

649
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:26,420
他在和什么人说话
<b>He's talking to someone.</b>

650
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:30,480
还对着我们指指点点
<b>He's pointing right at us.</b>

651
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:34,870
现在握起手来了
<b>Now they're shaking hands.</b>

652
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:35,570
什么
<b>What?</b>

653
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:36,490
这个坏人
<b>The villain!</b>

654
01:08:36,490 --> 01:08:38,160
他把我们卖了
<b>He's selling us out.</b>

655
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:01,960
安静
<b>Quiet!</b>

656
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:06,520
马上到城门关了
<b>We're approaching the tollgate.</b>

657
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:22,450
停船  货物检查  请出示文书
<b>Halt. Goods inspection. Papers, please.</b>

658
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,770
原来是你啊  巴德
<b>Oh, it's you, Bard.</b>

659
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:25,890
早上好  珀西
<b>Morning, Percy.</b>

660
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:27,520
有什么要申报的吗
<b>Anything to declare?</b>

661
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:31,840
没有  我又累又冷  想赶紧回家
<b>Nothing, that I am cold and tired, and ready for home.</b>

662
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,450
我也是
<b>You and me both.</b>

663
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:39,810
给你  没问题了
<b>Here we are, all in order.</b>

664
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:43,400
别着急
<b>Not so fast.</b>

665
01:09:43,530 --> 01:09:48,470
从林地王国托运回来的空木桶
<b>Consignment of empty barrels from the Woodland Realm.</b>

666
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:53,030
怎么不是空的呢
<b>Only, they are not empty,</b>

667
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:55,220
巴德
<b>are they, Bard?</b>

668
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:59,690
没记错的话  你的执照是驳船工
<b>If I recall correctly. Your licensed as a bargeman.</b>

669
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:04,020
而不是渔夫
<b>Not a fisherman.</b>

670
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:05,830
不关你的事
<b>That's none of your business!</b>

671
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:10,820
错了  这关城主的事  也就是我的事
<b>Wrong. It's the Master's business, which makes it my business.</b>

672
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:13,230
拜托  埃弗雷德  讲点情理  城民等着吃饭呢
<b>Oh, come on, Alfred, Have a heart. People need to eat!</b>

673
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:16,470
这些鱼是非法的
<b>These fish are illegal.</b>

674
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:19,020
-把桶清空  -快点
<b>- Empty the barrels over the side. - You heard him.</b>

675
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:21,070
倒进河里
<b>In the canal.</b>

676
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:23,100
快点
<b>Come on.</b>

677
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,210
镇上的人民在挨饿
<b>Folks in this town are struggling.</b>

678
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:29,230
日子艰难  食物又少
<b>Times are hard, food is scarce.</b>

679
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:30,840
跟我有什么关系
<b>That's not my problem.</b>

680
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:34,450
如果人们听说城主把鱼扔进湖里
<b>And when the people hear their Master's dumping the fish in the lake,</b>

681
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:37,210
掀起暴动的话
<b>when the rioting starts,</b>

682
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:41,340
跟你有关系了吗
<b>Will it be your problem, then?</b>

683
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,240
住手
<b>Stop!</b>

684
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:55,230
充当人民英雄吗  巴德  平民保护神
<b>Ever the people's champion, aye, Bard? Protector of the common folk.</b>

685
01:10:55,230 --> 01:10:58,510
他们不会一直支持你的  船夫
<b>You might have their favor now, bargeman. But it won't last.</b>

686
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:03,660
把门打开
<b>Raise the gate.</b>

687
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:10,070
别忘了  城主盯着你呢
<b>The Master has his eye on you, you do well to remember.</b>

688
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:11,650
我们知道你住哪里
<b>We know where you live.</b>

689
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:16,380
地方这么小  埃弗雷德  大家可都知根知底
<b>It's a small town, Alfred. Everyone knows where everyone lives.</b>

690
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,020
外面的动静很大
<b>All these talks of civil are unrest.</b>

691
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:37,340
有人在煽风点火  大人
<b>Someone's been stirring the pot, Sire.</b>

692
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:41,620
痛风了吗  大人
<b>Gout playing ox, Sire?</b>

693
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:46,050
是潮气  肯定是潮气  给我弄点白兰地
<b>It's the damp, it's the only possible explanation. Get me a brandy.</b>

694
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:49,370
大人  民众的情绪让人不快
<b>The mood of the people, sire, is turning ugly.</b>

695
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:52,800
平民就这样  埃弗雷德  让人不愉快
<b>They're commoners, Alfred. They've always been ugly.</b>

696
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:57,340
这地方到处是鱼腥臭气  又不怪我
<b>It's not my fault that they live in a place that stinks of fish oil and tar.</b>

697
01:11:57,910 --> 01:11:59,720
工作  房屋
<b>Jobs, shelter,</b>

698
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:03,030
食物  只有这点追求
<b>food, that's all they ever plead about.</b>

699
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:07,100
大人  肯定有人在幕后指使
<b>It is my belief, sire, that they've been led on by trouble makers.</b>

700
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:11,710
那就给我找出来  逮捕他们
<b>Then we must find these trouble makers, and arrest them.</b>

701
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,810
我也是这么想的  大人
<b>My thoughts exactly, sire.</b>

702
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:17,280
改革的言论给我压下去
<b>And all these talks of change must be supressed.</b>

703
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:21,070
绝对不能让造反的人聚在一起  制造言论
<b>What a fault to let the rebel banded together and start making noises.</b>

704
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:26,030
搞不好他们还要问责  成立委员会
<b>The next thing you know, they'll start asking questions, forming commities...</b>

705
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,870
发起调查
<b>launching inquiries.</b>

706
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:31,930
旧的不去  新的不来
<b>Out with the old, in with the new.</b>

707
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,090
什么
<b>What?</b>

708
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,480
我一直都在这么说  大人
<b>That's what I've been saying, sire.</b>

709
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,780
还有传言说要选举
<b>There's even talk of election.</b>

710
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:42,730
选举  真荒唐  我绝不允许
<b>Election? It's absurd. I won't stand for it.</b>

711
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:46,440
他们不需要您允许吧  大人
<b>I don't think they'll ask you to stand, sire.</b>

712
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:52,190
这些强盗  忘恩负义  还想造反
<b>Sackers, ingrates, rebel-rousers.</b>

713
01:12:52,190 --> 01:12:55,770
谁敢质疑我的权威
<b>Who would have the nerve to question my authority!</b>

714
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:58,450
谁敢  谁
<b>Who would dare? Who...</b>

715
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:04,710
巴德
<b>Bard.</b>

716
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:10,420
绝对没错  幕后黑手就是这个船夫
<b>You mark my words, that trouble-making bargeman is behind all this.</b>

717
01:13:18,290 --> 01:13:19,910
别碰我
<b>Get your hands off me.</b>

718
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:28,860
你没见过他们  他们没来过这里
<b>You didn't see them. They were never here.</b>

719
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,910
鱼送你了
<b>Fish you can have for nothing.</b>

720
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:36,000
跟上我
<b>Follow me.</b>

721
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:49,320
爸  我们的房子被监视了
<b>Da, our house, it's being watched.</b>

722
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,080
告诉城主我今天办完事了
<b>You can tell the Master I'm done for the day.</b>

723
01:14:28,190 --> 01:14:29,330
爸
<b>Da.</b>

724
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:30,940
你去哪了
<b>Where have you been?</b>

725
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:33,870
爸爸  你回来了  我好担心
<b>Father, there you are! I was worried.</b>

726
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:37,810
好  贝恩  叫他们出来
<b>Yes. Bain, get them in.</b>

727
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:49,820
要是你跟别人说  我就把你的胳膊拧下来
<b>If you speak of this to anyone. I'll rip your arms off.</b>

728
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,660
别碰我
<b>Off.</b>

729
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:56,160
在那边
<b>Out there.</b>

730
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:07,490
爸  为什么有矮人从厕所里爬出来
<b>Da, why are the Dwarves climbing out from our toilet?</b>

731
01:15:07,490 --> 01:15:09,050
他们能带来好运吗
<b>Will they bring us luck?</b>

732
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:20,200
可能不是很合身  但是保暖
<b>They may not be the best fit, but they'll keep you warm.</b>

733
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:22,250
谢谢
<b>Thank you.</b>

734
01:15:32,330 --> 01:15:34,490
矮人风弩
<b>The Dwarvish Windlass.</b>

735
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:36,910
你像是见了鬼魂一样
<b>You look like you've seen a ghost.</b>

736
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,220
没错  上次见到这武器
<b>Yes. The last time we saw such a weapon,</b>

737
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,550
河谷城化为了灰烬
<b>a city was on fire.</b>

738
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:48,810
那天巨龙袭来
<b>It was the day the dragon came.</b>

739
01:15:52,190 --> 01:15:55,020
斯矛革摧毁了河谷城
<b>The day that Smaug destroyed Dale.</b>

740
01:15:57,210 --> 01:15:59,560
城主吉利恩
<b>Girion, the Lord of the city.</b>

741
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,440
集结弓箭手射击巨龙
<b>Rallied his bowman to fire upon the beast.</b>

742
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:07,520
但龙皮无比坚固  牢不可破
<b>But a dragon's hide is tough. Tougher than the strongest armor.</b>

743
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:12,640
只有风弩射出的黑箭能够刺穿
<b>Only a black arrow fired from a Windlass would pierce the dragon hide.</b>

744
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:16,970
这种箭本就寥寥无几
<b>And few of those arrows were ever made.</b>

745
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:26,400
吉利恩背水一战时  仅剩数支
<b>The store was running low when Girion made his last stand.</b>

746
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:36,830
哪怕他能射中一箭
<b>Had the aim of men been true that day...</b>

747
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,460
也不会落到这步田地
<b>much would've been different.</b>

748
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:45,500
难道你当时在场
<b>You speak as if you were there?</b>

749
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,910
所有矮人都知道这个故事
<b>All Dwarves know the tale.</b>

750
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:51,480
那你应该知道吉利恩击中了巨龙
<b>And you would know that Girion hit the dragon?</b>

751
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:53,190
射落了左翼的一块鳞片
<b>It loosened the scale on the left wing</b>

752
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:56,170
再补一箭就能杀死那怪物
<b>one more shot he would have killed the beast.</b>

753
01:16:56,980 --> 01:17:00,370
不过是童话而已  孩子  只是童话
<b>That's fairy story, lad. Nothing more.</b>

754
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:02,910
你收了钱
<b>You took all our money.</b>

755
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,430
武器在哪里
<b>Where are the weapons?</b>

756
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:09,000
等着
<b>Wait here.</b>

757
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:25,620
明天是最后一个秋日
<b>Tomorrow begins our last day of autumn.</b>

758
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:27,980
后天便是杜林之日
<b>Durin's day falls the morning after next.</b>

759
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,290
必须在那之前赶到孤山
<b>We must reach the mountain before then.</b>

760
01:17:30,290 --> 01:17:31,620
如果不能呢
<b>And if we do not?</b>

761
01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:34,540
如果那之前找不到隐秘之门呢
<b>If we fail to find the hidden door before that time?</b>

762
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:36,440
那计划就全落空了
<b>Then this quest has been for nothing.</b>

763
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:49,860
这是什么
<b>What is this?</b>

764
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:51,430
钩矛
<b>Pike hook.</b>

765
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:53,510
旧鱼叉改的
<b>Made from an old harpoon.</b>

766
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:54,260
这个呢
<b>And this?</b>

767
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:57,230
我们叫它鹤嘴锄  改进过的铁匠锤
<b>A crowbill, we call it. Expansion from smittys hammer.</b>

768
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:58,970
虽然上手很重
<b>It's heavy in hand, I grant.</b>

769
01:17:58,970 --> 01:18:02,470
但需要保命时  也能凑合着用
<b>But in defense of your life, these will serve you better than none.</b>

770
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:05,220
我们买的是武器
<b>We paid you for weapons.</b>

771
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:08,520
铁铸黑鞘的宝剑
<b>Iron forged, swords of dark sheath.</b>

772
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:09,770
这是开玩笑
<b>It's a joke.</b>

773
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:14,280
这是军械库外最好的武器了
<b>You won't find better outside the city armory.</b>

774
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:17,000
铁铸的兵器都锁在军械库里
<b>All iron-forged weapons are held there and locked in key.</b>

775
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,450
索林
<b>Thorin.</b>

776
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,210
拿着这些走吧
<b>Why not take his offer and go?</b>

777
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:23,710
更差的兵器我都用过  你不也是
<b>I've made do with less. So have you.</b>

778
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:26,560
我们现在就走
<b>I say we leave now.</b>

779
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,270
你们哪都不能去
<b>You're not going anywhere.</b>

780
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:29,410
你看到什么了
<b>What did you see?</b>

781
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:33,540
全城的眼线  乃至狼狗都盯着这里
<b>There are spies watching this house and probably every wolf and dog in town.</b>

782
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:36,130
必须等到傍晚
<b>You must wait until nightfall.</b>

783
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,620
索林
<b>Thorin.</b>

784
01:19:06,670 --> 01:19:07,800
爸
<b>Da?</b>

785
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:12,230
别让他们出门
<b>Don't let them leave.</b>

786
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:39,340
我还当你是兽人

787
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:41,340
如果我是兽人

788
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:42,880
你早就死了

789
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:49,500
不要一个人追杀30个兽人
<b>You can not hunt 30 orcs on your own.</b>

790
01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:51,520
可我不是一个人
<b>But I'm not on my own.</b>

791
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:54,020
你知道我要跟来
<b>You knew I would come?</b>

792
01:19:56,430 --> 01:19:58,510
国王很愤怒  塔睿尔
<b>The king is angry, Tauriel.</b>

793
01:19:58,530 --> 01:20:02,040
600年来  我父亲一直保护你  宠爱你
<b>For 600 years, my father has protected you, favored you.</b>

794
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:03,670
你却违抗了他的命令
<b>You defied his orders.</b>

795
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,640
辜负了他的信任
<b>You betrayed his trust.</b>

796
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,500
跟我回去

797
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,250
他会原谅你的

798
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:11,890
但我不会

799
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:14,960
如果跟你回去  我不会原谅自己

800
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:18,020
国王从未准许兽人入境
<b>The king has never let Orcs fill from outlands.</b>

801
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:20,190
这次却纵容他们穿越边境
<b>But he would let this Orc pack cross our borders</b>

802
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:21,570
追杀我们的犯人
<b>and kill our prisoners.</b>

803
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:24,750
-我们不该插手  -怎么不该插手
<b>- It is not our fight. - It is our fight.</b>

804
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:30,070
他们不会善罢甘休  这是在助长邪恶
<b>It will not end here. With every victory this evil will grow.</b>

805
01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:33,300
如果你父亲一意孤行  我们袖手旁观
<b>If your father has his way, we would do nothing.</b>

806
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:38,160
我们只能躲在城墙后  不见天日
<b>We will hide within our walls, live our lives away from light.</b>

807
01:20:38,530 --> 01:20:40,330
任由黑暗侵袭
<b>And let the darkness descend.</b>

808
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,670
我们不是中土世界的一员吗
<b>Are we not a part of this world?</b>

809
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:49,680
<i>朋友</i>  怎么能让邪恶力量比我们强大
<b>Tell me <i>mellon</i>, when did we let evil become stronger than us?</b>

810
01:20:54,810 --> 01:20:56,960
你好  巴德  你在找什么
<b>Hello, Bard. What you after?</b>

811
01:20:58,470 --> 01:21:02,450
有一条旧挂毯  上哪去了
<b>There was a tapestry, an old one. Where has it gone?</b>

812
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:04,050
什么旧挂毯
<b>What tapestry are you talking about?</b>

813
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:05,880
这条
<b>This one.</b>

814
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:09,140
告诉你  他们是矮人  凭空出现的
<b>They were Dwarves, I tell you. Appeared out of nowhere.</b>

815
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:13,230
满脸胡子  眯缝眼  从来没见过
<b>Full-beards, pierced eyes. I've never seen the like.</b>

816
01:21:13,550 --> 01:21:15,470
矮人在这做什么
<b>What are Dwarves doing in these parts?</b>

817
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:16,880
是预言
<b>It's the prophecy.</b>

818
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:20,420
-预言  -杜林后人的预言
<b>- Prophecy? -Prophecy of Durin's folk.</b>

819
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:30,210
预言
<b>Prophecy?</b>

820
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:35,030
预言
<b>Prophecy.</b>

821
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:36,810
那些传说可能成真了
<b>The old tales may come true.</b>

822
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,240
大笔财宝
<b>Vast hordes of treasure?</b>

823
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:40,660
是真的吗
<b>Can it really be true?</b>

824
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:43,410
银泉之主回归了吗
<b>Has the Lord of the silver fountains returned?</b>

825
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:49,560
银泉之主  刻石之王
<b>The lord of the silver fountains. The king of carven stone.</b>

826
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:52,300
山下之王
<b>The King Beneath the Mountain.</b>

827
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:55,700
将重回宝座
<b>Shall come into his own.</b>

828
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:01,440
人民欢庆山下之王的回归
<b>And the bell shall ring in gladness at the Mountain King's return.</b>

829
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,620
但一切必以悲剧收场
<b>But all shall fail in sadness,</b>

830
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:08,080
湖水闪耀  战火重燃
<b>and the lake will shine and burn.</b>

831
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:13,310
-爸  我想阻止他们  -他们走了多久
<b>- Da, I tried to stopped them... - How long have they been gone?</b>

832
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:22,260
拿到武器  直接去孤山
<b>As soon we have the weapons we make straight for the Mountain.</b>

833
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:23,660
快  快  快
<b>Go, go, go.</b>

834
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:43,900
你还好吗
<b>You all right?</b>

835
01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:45,560
撑得住
<b>I can manage.</b>

836
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:47,870
我们赶紧走吧
<b>Let's just get out of here.</b>

837
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:03,420
快跑
<b>Run!</b>

838
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,540
这什么意思
<b>What is the meaning of this?</b>

839
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,750
抓到他们在偷武器  大人
<b>We caught them stealing weapon, sire.</b>

840
01:23:37,670 --> 01:23:39,620
这是全民公敌呀
<b>Enemies of the state, em?</b>

841
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:43,030
看样子是群下贱的佣兵  大人
<b>A disgrace bunch of mercenaries, if ever there were, Sire.</b>

842
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:44,320
住嘴
<b>Hold your tongue!</b>

843
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:49,480
你不知道你在跟谁讲话
<b>You do not know to whom you speak.</b>

844
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:53,300
这哪是什么犯罪  他是索林
<b>This is no common criminal! This is Thorin,</b>

845
01:23:53,610 --> 01:23:56,760
瑟罗尔的后人  瑟莱因之子
<b>son of Thrain, son of Thror!</b>

846
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:01,530
我们是艾雷博的矮人
<b>We are the Dwarves of Erebor.</b>

847
01:24:04,690 --> 01:24:07,520
我们来收复故土
<b>We have come to reclaim our homeland.</b>

848
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:15,130
我还记得这镇子昔日的辉煌
<b>I remember this town in the great days of old.</b>

849
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:18,680
码头停满了船舶
<b>Fleets of boats laid at the harbor,</b>

850
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:21,180
满载丝绸和珠宝
<b>filled with silks and fine gems.</b>

851
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:23,920
这里不是被人遗忘的湖边小城
<b>This was no forsaken town on a lake.</b>

852
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:28,290
这里曾是北方的贸易中心
<b>This was the center of all trade of the North.</b>

853
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,680
我要重现往日的辉煌
<b>I would see those days return,</b>

854
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:34,160
点亮矮人的熔炉
<b>I would relive the great forges of Dwarves,</b>

855
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:37,270
让艾雷博的商队
<b>send wealth and riches flowing once more...</b>

856
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:38,810
载满财富接踵而来
<b>from the hordes of Erebor!</b>

857
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:45,150
你只会带来死亡
<b>Death, that is what you will bring upon us.</b>

858
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:49,020
龙火和毁灭
<b>Dragon fire and ruin.</b>

859
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:54,690
吵醒了那怪物  我们就全完了
<b>If you awaken that beast, it will destroy us all.</b>

860
01:24:55,150 --> 01:24:58,460
你们可以听他劝阻  不过我保证
<b>You can listen to this nay-sayer, but I promise you this:</b>

861
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:02,490
如果成功
<b>If we succeed,</b>

862
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:06,650
孤山的财富大家可以一起分享
<b>all will share in the wealth of the Mountain.</b>

863
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:15,470
到手的财富  可以让十个埃加洛斯重现辉煌
<b>You will have enough gold, to rebuild Esgaroth 10 times over.</b>

864
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:21,080
所有人  听我说  听好
<b>All of you, listen to me! You must listen!</b>

865
01:25:21,370 --> 01:25:23,280
你们忘记河谷城的事了吗
<b>Have you forgotten what happened in Dale?</b>

866
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:28,150
忘记葬身火海的百姓了吗
<b>Have you forgotten of those who died in firestorm?</b>

867
01:25:30,650 --> 01:25:32,050
都是为了什么
<b>And for what purpose?</b>

868
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,640
为了山下之王盲目的野心
<b>The blind ambition of a Mountain King.</b>

869
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:39,590
贪婪蒙蔽了他的双眼  他心里只有欲望
<b>So riven by greed, he can not see beyond his own desire!</b>

870
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:44,950
等一等  我们每个人
<b>No, no. We must not, any of us,</b>

871
01:25:45,210 --> 01:25:47,740
都不要急着横加指责
<b>be too quick to lay blame.</b>

872
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:51,720
不要忘了  吉利恩
<b>Let us not forget, that it was Girion,</b>

873
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,040
河谷城主  你的先人
<b>Lord of Dale, your ancestor,</b>

874
01:25:55,410 --> 01:25:57,480
没能杀死那怪物
<b>who failed to kill the beast.</b>

875
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,750
没错  大人  我们都知道这个故事
<b>It's true, sire. We all know the story.</b>

876
01:26:04,710 --> 01:26:09,620
他射了一箭又一箭  却全部射偏
<b>Arrow after arrow he shot, each one missing its mark.</b>

877
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:17,880
你无权
<b>You have no right,</b>

878
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:21,390
无权进入孤山
<b>no right to enter that mountain.</b>

879
01:26:23,370 --> 01:26:25,070
只有我有权利
<b>I have the only right.</b>

880
01:26:31,630 --> 01:26:34,180
请问长湖城主
<b>I speak to the Master of the men of the lake.</b>

881
01:26:34,930 --> 01:26:36,670
您愿意见证预言成真吗
<b>Will you see the prophecy fulfilled?</b>

882
01:26:38,230 --> 01:26:39,390
愿意
<b>Will you...</b>

883
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:43,630
分享我们的无尽财富吗
<b>share in the great wealth of our people?</b>

884
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:49,490
您怎么说
<b>What say you?</b>

885
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:58,850
我要说  欢迎
<b>I say unto you, welcome!</b>

886
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:04,930
请平身  欢迎山下之王
<b>Welcome and rise! Welcome, King under the mountain!</b>

887
01:27:16,890 --> 01:27:18,360
你知道我们少一个人吧
<b>You do know we have one short?</b>

888
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:20,950
-比弗在哪  -他不在也不要管他
<b>- Where's Bifur? - He's not here, we leave him behind.</b>

889
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:24,170
想在日落前找到门  只能这么做
<b>You'll have to, if you were to find the door before nightfall.</b>

890
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,040
我们拖不起了
<b>We can risk no more delays.</b>

891
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:31,510
你不能去
<b>Not you.</b>

892
01:27:32,130 --> 01:27:34,010
今天要全力赶路  你会拖慢我们的
<b>We must travel with speed. You'll slow us down.</b>

893
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:37,270
你在说什么呢  我要跟你们走
<b>What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.</b>

894
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:38,490
不
<b>No.</b>

895
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:45,720
舅舅  我一定要看着那门打开
<b>Uncle, I must be there when that door is open.</b>

896
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:48,400
我们一定要一起仰望先祖的大厅  索林
<b>When we first look upon the halls of our fathers, Thorin...</b>

897
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:50,840
奇力  留下
<b>Kili, stay here,</b>

898
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:54,800
休息  痊愈后来找我们
<b>rest, join us when you're healed.</b>

899
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:01,760
我来陪这孩子
<b>I'll stay with the lad</b>

900
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:03,780
我的职责就是照顾伤员
<b>my duty lies with the wounded.</b>

901
01:28:04,030 --> 01:28:04,860
舅舅
<b>Uncle.</b>

902
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:08,930
我们是听着孤山的故事长大的
<b>We grew up with the tales of the Mountain, tales you told us.</b>

903
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:10,610
不要剥夺他的梦想
<b>You can't take that away from him.</b>

904
01:28:10,810 --> 01:28:12,950
-奇力  -我可以背着他
<b>- Kili. - I will carry him if I must!</b>

905
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:15,460
等你坐上王位  就能理解了
<b>One day you will be king and you will understand.</b>

906
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:19,510
不能因为一个矮人耽搁了远征
<b>I cannot risk the fate of this quest for the sake of one Dwarf.</b>

907
01:28:20,890 --> 01:28:22,440
哪怕是我的亲人
<b>Not even my own kin.</b>

908
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:29,290
菲力  别犯傻  你跟大家在一起
<b>Fili, don't be a fool. You belong with the company.</b>

909
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:30,660
我要和弟弟在一起
<b>I belong with my brother.</b>

910
01:28:42,490 --> 01:28:45,510
难道要出发了吗
<b>By my beard, is that the time!</b>

911
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:58,410
祝你们好运
<b>Good fortune to all!</b>

912
01:29:09,890 --> 01:29:10,660
让开
<b>Move.</b>

913
01:29:11,330 --> 01:29:12,140
不
<b>No.</b>

914
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:20,820
你们也错过开船了吗
<b>Did you miss the boarders as well?</b>

915
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:22,220
奇力  奇力
<b>Kili, Kili!</b>

916
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:28,940
不  我受够矮人了  走开
<b>No. I'm done with Dwarves, go away.</b>

917
01:29:29,150 --> 01:29:32,030
别  别  别  没人肯帮我们
<b>No, no, no. No one will help us.</b>

918
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:33,140
奇力病了
<b>Kili's sick.</b>

919
01:29:36,250 --> 01:29:37,430
是重病
<b>He's very sick.</b>

920
01:30:17,590 --> 01:30:18,870
这是哪
<b>What is this place?</b>

921
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:24,000
曾经的河谷城  现在只是一片废墟
<b>For once the city of Dale. Now it is a ruin.</b>

922
01:30:25,180 --> 01:30:27,520
斯矛革留下的荒原
<b>The desolation of Smaug.</b>

923
01:30:27,770 --> 01:30:29,370
马上到正午了
<b>The sun will soon reach midday.</b>

924
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:31,840
必须在日落前找到进入孤山的隐秘之门
<b>We must find the hidden door into the Mountain before it sets.</b>

925
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:33,550
-这边  -等等
<b>- This way. - Wait.</b>

926
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:35,430
这里是瞭望角吗
<b>Is this the overlook?</b>

927
01:30:35,850 --> 01:30:37,910
甘道夫说无论如何  都要在这等...
<b>Gandalf said to meet him here on no account of what you hear or...</b>

928
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:41,520
你见到他了吗  来不及等他了
<b>Do you see him? We have no time to wait upon a wizard.</b>

929
01:30:42,210 --> 01:30:43,100
我们只能靠自己了
<b>We're on our own.</b>

930
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:43,890
来吧
<b>Come.</b>

931
01:31:01,130 --> 01:31:05,250
多尔戈多  巫师之山
<b>Dol Guldur, the hill of sorcerer.</b>

932
01:31:05,470 --> 01:31:07,650
看样子废弃已久了
<b>It looks completely abandoned.</b>

933
01:31:07,970 --> 01:31:09,620
像是故意的
<b>As it is meant to.</b>

934
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:13,590
这是障眼法
<b>A spell of concealment lies over this place.</b>

935
01:31:14,730 --> 01:31:18,060
敌人应该不想现出真身
<b>Which means our enemies are not yet ready to reveal himself.</b>

936
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:23,930
他还没恢复元气
<b>He has not regained his full strength.</b>

所以应该有个锁孔

965
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:08,480
杜林之日  落日余晖

没用  门锁上了
<b>It's no good, the door is sealed.</b>

976
01:35:59,270 --> 01:36:00,380

现身吧
<b>Stand into the light.</b>

1075
01:53:00,850 --> 01:53:05,050
有些不对劲
<b>There is something about you.</b>

1076
01:53:07,410 --> 01:53:09,320
你带着什么
<b>Something you carry.</b>

1077
01:53:10,420 --> 01:53:13,600
是金子做的
<b>Something made of gold.</b>

1078
01:53:14,050 --> 01:53:20,280
却比金子珍贵
<b>But far more precious.</b>

1079
01:53:24,310 --> 01:53:29,420
在这呀  躲躲藏藏的小偷
<b>There you are, a thief in the shadows.</b>

1080
01:53:31,350 --> 01:53:33,830
我没想偷东西
<b>I did not come to steal from you.</b>

1081
01:53:34,120 --> 01:53:37,770
无比富有的斯矛革
<b>O Smaug, the unassessably wealthy.</b>

1082
01:53:37,770 --> 01:53:40,600
我只想亲眼目睹
<b>I merely want to get eyes upon your magnificence.</b>

1083
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:44,890
传说中伟岸的巨龙
<b>To see if you really were as great as the old tales say.</b>

1084
01:53:45,130 --> 01:53:46,770
我原来不相信
<b>I did not believe them!</b>

1085
01:53:56,050 --> 01:54:00,280
现在信了吗
<b>And do you now?</b>

1086
01:54:01,330 --> 01:54:02,430
信了
<b>Truly.</b>

1087
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:05,860
传说和歌谣里的描述
<b>The tales and songs...</b>

1088
01:54:07,030 --> 01:54:12,820
在你一比真是相形见绌  庞然大物斯矛革
<b>fall utterly short, of your enormity, O Smaug the stupendous!</b>

1089
01:54:12,820 --> 01:54:16,600
你觉得奉承我能活命吗
<b>Do you think flattery will keep you alive?</b>

1090
01:54:16,820 --> 01:54:17,800
不
<b>No, no...</b>

1091
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:19,410
不能
<b>No indeed.</b>

1092
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:25,130
你好像认识我
<b>You seem familiar with my name.</b>

1093
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:28,740
我却不记得你的气味
<b>But I don't remember smelling your kind before.</b>

1094
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:33,490
你是谁  哪里来的
<b>Who are you? And where do you come from...</b>

1095
01:54:33,490 --> 01:54:36,290
请问
<b>may I ask?</b>

1096
01:54:41,830 --> 01:54:42,950
我
<b>I...</b>

1097
01:54:45,590 --> 01:54:47,410
我来自山下
<b>I came from under the hill.</b>

1098
01:54:47,530 --> 01:54:48,840
山下
<b>Under hill?</b>

1099
01:54:52,760 --> 01:54:55,600
我翻山越岭  跋山涉水
<b>And under hills and over hills, my path is lead.</b>

1100
01:54:56,760 --> 01:55:00,970
来去无踪的我  穿梭到了这里
<b>And, and through the air. I am here that He walks unseen.</b>

1101
01:55:00,970 --> 01:55:05,850
厉害  你还有什么名号
<b>Impressive, what else do you claim to be?</b>

1102
01:55:05,850 --> 01:55:07,220
我是
<b>I am...</b>

1103
01:55:09,990 --> 01:55:11,320
好运随身的人
<b>luck-wearer...</b>

1104
01:55:12,990 --> 01:55:17,940
-猜谜能手  -好名号  继续
<b>- Riddle-maker. - Lovely titles, go on.</b>

1105
01:55:18,100 --> 01:55:20,640
-酒桶骑士  -酒桶
<b>- Barrel-rider. - Barrels.</b>

1106
01:55:20,910 --> 01:55:22,800
有点意思了
<b>Now that is interesting.</b>

1107
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:28,880
你的矮人朋友呢
<b>And what about your little Dwarf friends?</b>

1108
01:55:29,150 --> 01:55:31,530
都躲在哪里
<b>Where are they hiding?</b>

1109
01:55:32,730 --> 01:55:36,790
矮人  没
<b>D...dwarves? No...</b>

1110
01:55:37,610 --> 01:55:40,680
哪有什么矮人  你弄错了
<b>No, no Dwarves here. You got that all wrong.</b>

1111
01:55:40,690 --> 01:55:42,700
我不信
<b>I don't think so.</b>

1112
01:55:42,700 --> 01:55:48,070
酒桶骑士  他们叫你来送死
<b>Barrel-rider, they sent you in here to do their dirty work,</b>

1113
01:55:48,070 --> 01:55:51,370
自己在外面做缩头乌龟
<b>while they skulk about outside.</b>

1114
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:54,840
你真的错了
<b>Truly. You are mistaken...</b>

1115
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:58,600
伟大的斯矛革  猛兽之王
<b>O Smaug, chiefest and greatest of all calamities.</b>

1116
01:55:58,600 --> 01:56:05,850
别看你偷东西还撒谎  倒是很有礼貌呢
<b>You have nice manners for a thief and a liar.</b>

1117
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:10,290
我熟悉矮人的气味和味道
<b>I know the smell and taste of Dwarf.</b>

1118
01:56:10,580 --> 01:56:12,640
无比熟悉
<b>No one better.</b>

1119
01:56:13,090 --> 01:56:14,830
是为了金子
<b>It is the gold.</b>

1120
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:19,630
他们对黄金趋之若鹜
<b>They are drawn to treasure like flies to dead flesh.</b>

1121
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:25,910
你以为我不知道吗
<b>Did you think I did not know this day would come?</b>

1122
01:56:27,590 --> 01:56:30,660
我早料到这群虚伪小人
<b>That a pack of canting dogs</b>

1123
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:34,790
会偷偷潜回孤山
<b>will come crawling back to the Mountain.</b>

1124
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:42,730
-地震吗  -孩子  这动静
<b>- Was that an earthquake? - That, my lad...</b>

1125
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:47,300
是龙
<b>was a dragon.</b>

1126
01:56:56,070 --> 01:56:58,630
-爸  -山那边来的
<b>- Da? - It's come from the mountain.</b>

1127
01:57:02,710 --> 01:57:06,350
别管我们了  带着孩子逃吧
<b>You should leave us. Take your children, get out of here.</b>

1128
01:57:06,550 --> 01:57:10,660
逃去哪里  无处可逃了
<b>And go where? There is nowhere to go.</b>

1129
01:57:12,330 --> 01:57:17,120
-我们会死吗  爸  -不会  亲爱的
<b>- Are we going to die, da? - No, darling.</b>

1130
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:19,840
火龙会杀掉我们
<b>The dragon is going to kill us.</b>

1131
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:32,090
我会先杀掉它
<b>Not if I kill it first.</b>

1132
01:57:33,770 --> 01:57:39,420
山下之王已死  他的王位在我脚下
<b>The King Under the Mountain is dead. I took his throne.</b>

1133
01:57:39,630 --> 01:57:43,760
他的子民是我的点心
<b>I ate his people like a wolf among sheep.</b>

1134
01:57:47,270 --> 01:57:52,350
我肆意杀戮  随心所欲
<b>I kill where I wish, when I wish.</b>

1135
01:57:52,390 --> 01:57:55,950
我的鳞甲坚如钢铁
<b>My armor is iron!</b>

1136
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:07,450
坚不可摧
<b>No blade can pierce me!</b>

1137
01:58:10,460 --> 01:58:14,510
-安全  -黑箭  你怎么不早说
<b>- All right. - A black arrow. Why did you never tell me?</b>

1138
01:58:14,510 --> 01:58:16,120
因为没必要告诉你
<b>Because you did not need to know.</b>

1139
01:58:23,670 --> 01:58:27,460
好好听我说  你去引开警卫
<b>Listen to me carefully. I need you to distract the guards.</b>

1140
01:58:28,220 --> 01:58:31,690
我得上塔  将箭上弦
<b>Once I'm at the top of the tower, I will set the arrow to the bow.</b>

1141
01:58:31,690 --> 01:58:33,850
-他在这  -卫兵  抓住他
<b>- There he is. - Guards, after him!</b>

1142
01:58:33,850 --> 01:58:35,790
快  那边
<b>Quickly, down there! Go!</b>

1143
01:58:35,890 --> 01:58:37,100
抓住他
<b>Stop him!</b>

1144
01:58:50,210 --> 01:58:51,710
贝恩  贝恩
<b>Bain, Bain.</b>

1145
01:58:52,710 --> 01:58:55,270
藏好  不能让别人发现
<b>Keep it safe, don't let anyone find it.</b>

1146
01:58:55,870 --> 01:58:58,450
-我来对付他们  去吧  -我不走
<b>- I'll deal with them. Now go! - I'm not leaving.</b>

1147
01:59:02,380 --> 01:59:04,030
-拉加  -你被捕了
<b>- Ragar. - You're under arrest.</b>

1148
01:59:04,030 --> 01:59:07,150
-什么罪名  -那要听城主的
<b>- On what charge? - Any charge the Master chooses.</b>

1149
01:59:49,650 --> 01:59:52,240
-比尔博怎么办  -再给他点时间
<b>- What about Bilbo? - Give him more time.</b>

1150
01:59:52,270 --> 01:59:54,860
给他时间干嘛  送死吗
<b>Time to do what? To be killed?</b>

1151
01:59:56,800 --> 02:00:01,850
-你怕了  -我是怕了
<b>- You're afraid. - Yes, I'm afraid.</b>

1152
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:04,840
我替你担心
<b>I fear for you,</b>

1153
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:08,300
怕那宝藏迷人心智的魔力
<b>the sickness the lies upon that treasure,</b>

1154
02:00:08,300 --> 02:00:10,830
那害你祖父癫狂的恶疾
<b>a sickness which drove your grandfather mad.</b>

1155
02:00:10,830 --> 02:00:12,560
我不是我祖父
<b>I'm not my grandfather.</b>

1156
02:00:12,820 --> 02:00:14,090
你也不是你自己了
<b>You're not yourself.</b>

1157
02:00:15,300 --> 02:00:17,600
我认识的索林从不畏缩
<b>The Thorin I know would not hesitate to go in there.</b>

1158
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:22,550
不能因为一个盗贼耽误了远征
<b>I will not risk this quest for the life of one burglar.</b>

1159
02:00:24,350 --> 02:00:28,000
他有名字  叫比尔博
<b>Bilbo, his name is Bilbo.</b>

1160
02:00:30,970 --> 02:00:36,880
是橡木盾  妄图篡权的卑鄙小人
<b>It's Oakenshield, that filthy Dwarvish usurper!</b>

1161
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:44,750
他派你来偷阿肯宝钻  对吧
<b>He sent you here for the Arkenstone, didn't he?</b>

1162
02:00:44,750 --> 02:00:46,030
不是
<b>No, no, no...</b>

1163
02:00:46,030 --> 02:00:48,400
你在说什么啊
<b>I don't know what you're talking about.</b>

1164
02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:50,460
不用否认
<b>Don't bother denying it,</b>

1165
02:00:50,460 --> 02:00:53,290
我早看出他的祸心了
<b>I guessed his foul purpose some time ago.</b>

1166
02:00:55,490 --> 02:00:57,250
但无所谓
<b>But it matters not.</b>

1167
02:00:57,250 --> 02:01:01,520
橡木盾的远征注定要失败
<b>Oakenshield's quest will fail.</b>

1168
02:01:02,470 --> 02:01:04,650
黑暗到来了
<b>A darkness is coming.</b>

1169
02:01:05,080 --> 02:01:09,370
蔓延到了中土的每个角落
<b>It was spread to every corner of the land.</b>

1170
02:01:51,620 --> 02:01:55,320
你被利用了  躲躲藏藏的小偷
<b>You are being used, thief in the shadows.</b>

1171
02:01:55,320 --> 02:01:58,860
你只是他们手里的工具
<b>You are only ever a means to an end.</b>

1172
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:03,130
橡木盾那个胆小鬼
<b>The coward Oakenshield has weighed</b>

1173
02:02:03,130 --> 02:02:07,890
根本没把你的小命当回事
<b>the value of your life, and found it worth nothing.</b>

1174
02:02:07,890 --> 02:02:08,890
不是的
<b>No.</b>

1175
02:02:09,900 --> 02:02:13,110
你骗人
<b>No, you're lying.</b>

1176
02:02:13,110 --> 02:02:17,100
他怎么许诺的  要分你些财宝吗
<b>What did he promise you, a share of the treasure?</b>

1177
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:20,240
好像财宝是他的一样
<b>As if it was his to give.</b>

1178
02:02:21,070 --> 02:02:24,470
你一枚金币都不许带走
<b>I will not part with a single coin!</b>

1179
02:02:24,470 --> 02:02:27,360
不许带走
<b>Not one piece of it.</b>

1180
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:37,810
我的利齿是宝剑  尖爪是长矛
<b>My teeth are swords, my claws are spears.</b>

1181
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:43,830
双翼一挥  暴风来袭
<b>My wings, are a hurricane.</b>

1182
02:02:49,870 --> 02:02:51,290
传说是真的
<b>So it is true.</b>

1183
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:55,210
-黑箭射中了你  -你说什么
<b>- The black arrow found its mark. - What did you say?</b>

1184
02:02:55,210 --> 02:02:59,020
没什么  您果然名不虚传
<b>Nothing. I was just saying your reputation proceeds you,</b>

1185
02:02:59,030 --> 02:03:01,700
暴君斯矛革
<b>O Smaug the Tyrannical.</b>

1186
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:06,280
您真的是无可比拟
<b>Truly, you have no equal on this earth.</b>

1187
02:03:09,910 --> 02:03:14,080
我差点动心  让你拿走宝钻
<b>I'm almost tempted to let you take it.</b>

1188
02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:17,920
好让橡木盾受折磨
<b>If only to see Oakenshield suffer.</b>

1189
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:21,410
看他走向毁灭
<b>Watch it destroy him.</b>

1190
02:03:22,030 --> 02:03:28,300
看他荒废自己  日渐癫狂
<b>Watch it corrupt his arms, and drive him mad.</b>

1191
02:03:31,460 --> 02:03:36,020
不过算了  就陪你玩到这吧
<b>But I think not, I think our little game ends here.</b>

1192
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:39,180
说吧  小偷
<b>So tell me, thief.</b>

1193
02:03:39,780 --> 02:03:42,160
你想怎么死
<b>How do you choose to die?</b>

1194
02:04:54,660 --> 02:04:56,750
爸  是你吗
<b>Da? Is that you, Da?</b>

1195
02:06:45,040 --> 02:06:47,410
橡木盾跑了

1196
02:06:48,340 --> 02:06:49,430
撤退

1197
02:06:49,710 --> 02:06:51,210
桥上会合

1198
02:07:09,240 --> 02:07:10,680
都死了
<b>You killed them all.</b>

1199
02:07:10,680 --> 02:07:13,000
外面还有  塔睿尔
<b>There are others, Tauriel.</b>

1200
02:07:13,640 --> 02:07:14,590
走
<b>Come.</b>

1201
02:07:18,820 --> 02:07:20,370
他要死了
<b>We're losing him.</b>

1202
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:24,790
塔睿尔
<b>Tauriel.</b>

1203
02:07:48,780 --> 02:07:50,210
艾瑟拉斯[王叶草]
<b>Athelas.</b>

1204
02:07:52,730 --> 02:07:54,240
艾瑟拉斯
<b>Athelas.</b>

1205
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:56,320
你要干嘛
<b>What are you doing?</b>

1206
02:07:59,160 --> 02:08:00,700
救他
<b>I'm going to save him.</b>

1207
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:23,260
-你没死  -活不久了
<b>- You're alive. - Not for much longer.</b>

1208
02:08:23,260 --> 02:08:25,090
-阿肯宝钻呢  -火龙要来了
<b>- Did you find the Arkenstone? - The dragon's coming.</b>

1209
02:08:25,090 --> 02:08:26,490
阿肯宝钻
<b>The Arkenstone.</b>

1210
02:08:29,130 --> 02:08:30,340
找到了吗
<b>Did you find it?</b>

1211
02:08:36,630 --> 02:08:37,750
快走吧
<b>We should get out.</b>

1212
02:08:41,080 --> 02:08:42,080
索林
<b>Thorin.</b>

1213
02:08:45,700 --> 02:08:46,710
索林
<b>Thorin.</b>

1214
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:20,580
化为灰烬吧
<b>You will burn!</b>

1215
02:09:27,650 --> 02:09:29,800
-跑  -快跑  比尔博
<b>- Come on! - Come on, Bilbo!</b>

1216
02:09:42,680 --> 02:09:43,630
走
<b>Come on.</b>

1217
02:10:00,630 --> 02:10:01,700
按住他
<b>Hold him down.</b>

1218
02:10:10,010 --> 02:10:16,860
<i>愿星月之光眷顾你  赐你生机
<b>Menno o nin na hon i eliad annen annin hon leitho o-ngurth.</i></b>

1219
02:10:18,970 --> 02:10:20,060
蒂尔达
<b>Tilda!</b>

<i>愿星月之光眷顾你  赐你生机

1224
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:23,680
我们甩掉它了
<b>We have given him the slip.</b>

1225
02:11:23,690 --> 02:11:27,060
他会追上的
<b>No, he'll still come in for that.</b>

1226
02:11:29,090 --> 02:11:32,400
-现在去哪  -西边的卫队室
<b>- So where to now? - Western guard room.</b>

1227
02:11:32,900 --> 02:11:35,800
-或许能出去  -太高了
<b>- There may be a way out. - It's too high.</b>

1228
02:11:36,270 --> 02:11:38,650
-没可能的  -只有这条路了
<b>- No chance that way. - It's our only chance.</b>

1229
02:11:40,330 --> 02:11:41,510
我们得赌一把
<b>We have to try it.</b>

1230
02:12:47,010 --> 02:12:50,860
我只听过精灵疗伤的传说
<b>I've heard tales of wonders of Elvish medicine.</b>

1231
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,480
亲眼见到真是荣幸
<b>That was a privilege to witness.</b>

1232
02:12:56,260 --> 02:12:57,460
塔睿尔
<b>Tauriel.</b>

1233
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:02,730
躺好
<b>Lie still.</b>

1234
02:13:10,190 --> 02:13:12,050
你不是她
<b>You cannot be her.</b>

1235
02:13:15,680 --> 02:13:17,410
她在远方
<b>She's far away.</b>

1236
02:13:22,060 --> 02:13:25,540
在遥不可及的远方
<b>She is far, far away from me.</b>

1237
02:13:26,920 --> 02:13:32,320
她走在天上的星光里
<b>She walks in starlight in another world.</b>

1238
02:13:37,330 --> 02:13:39,120
可惜只是个梦
<b>It was just a dream.</b>

1239
02:13:51,120 --> 02:13:53,180
你觉得她会爱上我吗
<b>Do you think she could have loved me?</b>

1240
02:14:00,260 --> 02:14:01,260
跟紧
<b>Stay close.</b>

1241
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:15,280
-完了  -没路了
<b>- That's it, then. - There's no way out.</b>

1242
02:14:22,300 --> 02:14:24,020
最后的族人
<b>The last of our kin.</b>

1243
02:14:28,240 --> 02:14:33,290
绝处逢生的希望  成了泡影
<b>They must have come here, hoping beyond hope.</b>

1244
02:14:43,140 --> 02:14:45,100
回矿山看看吧
<b>We can try to reach the mines.</b>

1245
02:14:46,340 --> 02:14:48,180
在生命最后的时刻
<b>My last few days.</b>

1246
02:14:50,610 --> 02:14:51,690
不
<b>No.</b>

1247
02:14:54,760 --> 02:14:56,570
我不要这样死去
<b>I will not die like this.</b>

1248
02:14:58,330 --> 02:15:01,840
畏缩不前  苟延残喘
<b>Cowering, clawing for breath.</b>

1249
02:15:06,970 --> 02:15:10,580
-我们去熔炉  -会被发现的  死路一条
<b>- We make for the forges. - He'll see us, sure as death.</b>

1250
02:15:10,580 --> 02:15:12,040
分头行动就不会
<b>Not if we split up.</b>

1251
02:15:12,040 --> 02:15:15,020
索林  我们到不了的
<b>Thorin, we'll never make it.</b>

1252
02:15:15,020 --> 02:15:19,020
总有人能到  引他去熔炉
<b>Some of us might, lead him to the forges.</b>

1253
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:21,730
我们要屠龙
<b>We kill the dragon.</b>

1254
02:15:23,730 --> 02:15:28,610
就算是死路一条  也是同生共死
<b>If this is to end in fire, then we will all burn together.</b>

1255
02:15:30,260 --> 02:15:31,310
这边
<b>This way.</b>

1256
02:15:36,020 --> 02:15:42,100
逃命  逃命去吧
<b>Flee, flee, run for your lives.</b>

1257
02:15:42,100 --> 02:15:46,610
虽然无处可逃了
<b>There is nowhere to hide.</b>

1258
02:15:46,660 --> 02:15:47,860
看后面
<b>Behind you!</b>

1259
02:15:49,360 --> 02:15:50,360
这边
<b>Come on!</b>

1260
02:15:52,490 --> 02:15:53,460
跑
<b>Run!</b>

1261
02:15:55,030 --> 02:15:58,040
在这边
<b>Hey you! Here!</b>

1262
02:16:30,170 --> 02:16:32,800
给多尔戈多送信

1263
02:16:33,170 --> 02:16:35,940
橡木盾到了孤山

1264
02:16:46,770 --> 02:16:47,740
快去

1265
02:16:48,420 --> 02:16:50,590
你  跟我来

1266
02:18:55,680 --> 02:18:57,810
这条路
<b>This way, it's this way!</b>

1267
02:18:57,810 --> 02:19:00,530
-这边  -索林
<b>- Come on! - Thorin!</b>

1268
02:19:05,550 --> 02:19:06,720
跟巴林走
<b>Follow Balin.</b>

1269
02:19:08,050 --> 02:19:09,210
-索林  -快
<b>- Thorin! - Come on!</b>

1270
02:19:24,980 --> 02:19:25,990
索林
<b>Thorin!</b>

1271
02:19:35,660 --> 02:19:36,780
抓紧
<b>Hold on!</b>

1272
02:20:10,260 --> 02:20:11,660
快
<b>Come on!</b>

1273
02:20:14,370 --> 02:20:15,610
快跑
<b>Go, go!</b>

1274
02:20:19,820 --> 02:20:23,670
行不通  熔炉早就冷却了
<b>Our plan's not gonna work. These furnaces are stone-cold.</b>

1275
02:20:23,670 --> 02:20:24,720
确实
<b>He's right.</b>

1276
02:20:24,720 --> 02:20:27,560
没有大火  没法点燃熔炉
<b>With no fire hot enough to set them ablaze.</b>

1277
02:20:30,170 --> 02:20:31,390
没有吗
<b>Have we not?</b>

1278
02:20:33,110 --> 02:20:35,850
没想到赢你这么容易
<b>I did not look to see you so easily outwitted!</b>

1279
02:20:39,990 --> 02:20:41,590
你变慢了
<b>You're growing slow,</b>

1280
02:20:41,870 --> 02:20:45,570
变胖了  老不死的
<b>and fat, you dotage,</b>

1281
02:20:46,930 --> 02:20:48,180
糊涂虫
<b>slug!</b>

1282
02:20:49,630 --> 02:20:50,710
躲起来
<b>Take cover!</b>

1283
02:21:18,770 --> 02:21:21,190
邦伯  拉动风箱
<b>Bombur, get those bellows working!</b>

1284
02:21:21,190 --> 02:21:22,180
快
<b>Go!</b>

1285
02:21:36,430 --> 02:21:40,320
比尔博  去操纵杆那  等我信号
<b>Bilbo! Up there! On my mark, pull that lever.</b>

1286
02:21:50,900 --> 02:21:53,380
巴林  能弄些炸弹吗
<b>Balin, can you still make us a blast flame?</b>

1287
02:21:53,380 --> 02:21:55,970
行  一小会就弄好
<b>Aye, it'll only take a jiffy. Come on.</b>

1288
02:21:57,630 --> 02:21:59,200
一小会也等不及啊
<b>We don't have a jiffy.</b>

1289
02:22:11,010 --> 02:22:14,210
-硫磺呢  -你真的会做吗
<b>- Where's the sulphur? - You sure you know what are you doing?</b>

1290
02:22:26,030 --> 02:22:27,010
速度
<b>Come on!</b>

1291
02:22:49,070 --> 02:22:50,400
动手
<b>Now!</b>

1292
02:24:46,510 --> 02:24:48,530
引它去历代君王的画像那
<b>Lead him to the gallery of the kings.</b>

1293
02:25:36,620 --> 02:25:37,980
别停下  比尔博
<b>Keep going, Bilbo!</b>

1294
02:26:24,630 --> 02:26:27,580
你以为你骗得了我吗
<b>You, think you can deceive me?</b>

1295
02:26:27,580 --> 02:26:29,550
酒桶骑士
<b>Barrel-rider.</b>

1296
02:26:31,390 --> 02:26:34,000
你是从长湖城来的
<b>You have come from Lake-town.</b>

1297
02:26:35,800 --> 02:26:41,260
这群肮脏的矮人  和运河上的生意人
<b>It is some sort of schemes hatched between these filthy Dwarves</b>

1298
02:26:41,260 --> 02:26:44,110
悲哀的长湖城人一起密谋
<b>and those miserable tub-trading lakeman.</b>

1299
02:26:45,240 --> 02:26:52,060
只知道射黑箭的胆小鬼们
<b>The sniveling cowards, with their long bows and black arrows.</b>

1300
02:26:52,360 --> 02:26:58,060
-我是不是该会会他们  -糟糕
<b>- Perhaps it is time I pay them a visit. - No.</b>

1301
02:27:00,090 --> 02:27:04,680
这和他们无关  别去长湖城
<b>This isn't their fault. Wait, you cannot go to Lake-town!</b>

1302
02:27:06,520 --> 02:27:10,600
你在乎他们  对吧
<b>You care about them, do you?</b>

1303
02:27:11,060 --> 02:27:12,130
很好
<b>Good.</b>

1304
02:27:12,620 --> 02:27:15,470
那就看着他们化为灰烬吧
<b>And you can watch them die.</b>

1305
02:27:20,450 --> 02:27:24,430
我在这  笨虫子
<b>Here! You witless worm!</b>

1306
02:27:30,170 --> 02:27:34,410
-你  -新帐旧账一起算
<b>- You. - I am taking back what you stole.</b>

1307
02:27:38,790 --> 02:27:44,280
你斗不过我的  矮人
<b>You will take nothing from me, Dwarf.</b>

1308
02:27:44,980 --> 02:27:50,000
旧日的矮人勇士都倒在我脚下
<b>I laid low your warriors of old,</b>

1309
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:54,590
吓得魂不附体
<b>eye in still terror in the hearts of men.</b>

1310
02:27:55,700 --> 02:28:01,040
我才是山下之王
<b>I am King Under the Mountain.</b>

1311
02:28:01,550 --> 02:28:05,810
这王国不属于你  这是矮人之国
<b>This is not your kingdom, these are Dwarf lands.</b>

1312
02:28:06,780 --> 02:28:08,770
矮人的黄金
<b>This is Dwarf gold.</b>

1313
02:28:10,100 --> 02:28:13,750
看矮人怎么复仇吧
<b>And we will have our revenge.</b>

1314
02:29:34,200 --> 02:29:39,290
我会复仇的
<b>I will revenge, revenge!</b>

1315
02:29:39,860 --> 02:29:45,170
我要去复仇
<b>I will show you revenge!</b>

1316
02:30:21,380 --> 02:30:24,830
听我说  你不知道什么来了吗
<b>Listen to me, you don't know what is coming?</b>

1317
02:30:27,740 --> 02:30:31,510
我就是烈焰
<b>I am fire.</b>

1318
02:30:32,510 --> 02:30:35,060
我就是
<b>I am...</b>

1319
02:30:37,160 --> 02:30:38,420
死亡
<b>Death.</b>

1320
02:30:47,320 --> 02:30:48,590
我们都干了什么
<b>What have we done?</b>
