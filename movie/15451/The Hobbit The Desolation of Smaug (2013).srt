碰到你真巧
Well, now, this is a fine chance.

我收到消息
I receive words

25
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,580
有人看到我父親在登蘭德荒野游蕩
that my father have been seen wandering in the wilds near Dunland.

26
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,810
我去找過  但一無所獲
I went looking, found no sign of him.

27
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,130
索林  很久以來
Thorin, it's been a long time since anything

28
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,440
瑟萊因的消息都只是謠言
but rumor was heard of Thrain.

29
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,820
他還活著  我敢保證
He still lives, I am sure of it.

30
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,280
我父親失蹤前拜訪過你
My father came to see you before he went missing.

31
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,190
你對他說了什么
What did you say to him?

32
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,240
我敦促他進軍艾雷博
I urged him to march upon Erebor.

33
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,070
集合矮人的七支大軍
To gather the seven armies of dwarves.

34
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,220
消滅惡龍  收復孤山
To destroy the dragon and take back the Lonely Mountain.

35
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:00,460
我也要同樣敦促你  去收復家園
And I would say the same to you, take back your homeland.

36
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,770
你不是碰巧遇到我吧  甘道夫
This is no chance meeting, is it, Gandalf?

37
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,770
不
No.

38
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,850
不是
It is not.

39
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,370
孤山一直困擾著我  索林
The Lonely Mountain troubles me, Thorin.

40
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,900
惡龍盤踞得太久
That dragon has sat there long enough.

41
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,810
會引來更加邪惡的力量
Sooner or later, darker minds will turn towards Erebor.

42
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:28,000
我順綠色大道南下時  遇到了些討厭的生物
I ran into some unsavory characters whilst travelling along Greenway.

43
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,690
把我當成了流浪漢
They mistook me for a vagabond.

44
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,590
他們肯定后悔了
I imagine they regreted that.

45
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,890
他們還帶了個信
One of them was carrying a message.

46
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,180
這是黑語言[魔多語]fsIt is Black Speech.

47
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,630
-這是懸賞  -懸賞什么
- He promised as payment. - For what?

48
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,290
你的人頭
Your head.

49
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,150
有人想要你死
Someone wants you dead.

50
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,460
索林  你不能再等了
Thorin, you could wait no longer,

51
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,130
你是杜林王座的繼承人
you are the heir to the throne of Durin.

52
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,680
召集矮人軍隊
Unite the armies of the Dwarves.

53
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,810
齊心協力  去奪回艾雷博
Together you have the might and power to retake Erebor.

54
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,510
召集七大矮人家族的會議
Summon a meeting of the seven Dwarf families,

55
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,770
要求他們信守誓言
demand they stand by their oath.

56
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,500
七大家族的軍隊
The Seven Armies sworn an oath to the one

57
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,220
只效忠手握阿肯寶鉆的人
who wields the King's Jewel, the Arkenstone.

58
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,360
只有帝王珍寶才能聯合他們
It is the only thing that will unite them,

59
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,700
而且  那寶石已經被斯矛革偷走了
and in case you have forgotten, that jewel was stolen by Smaug.

60
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,790
如果我幫助你找回它呢
What if I were to help you reclaim it?

61
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,310
怎么找  寶石遠在半個中土世界之外
How? The Arkenstone lies half a world away,

62
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,860
在那只火龍的魔掌中
buried beneath the feet of a fire-breathing dragon.

63
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,520
對
Yes.

64
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,990
所以我們需要一個盜賊
Which is why we're going to need a burglar.

Couple of leagues, no more.

70
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,090
但還有更要命的
But that's not the worst of it.

71
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,410
他們會嗅到我們的氣味的
They will smell us, pick our scent.

72
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,830
現在還沒  不過遲早會的
Not yet but they will do.

73
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:52,950
我們還有別的麻煩
We have another problem.

74
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,220
他們看見你了嗎
Did they see you?

75
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,270
-看見了你嗎  -不  不是這個
- They saw you? - No. That's not it.

76
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,290
我怎么說的  安靜得像只老鼠
What did I tell you? Quiet as a mouse.

天生是塊盜賊的料
Excellent burglar material.

78
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,780
聽我說  都聽我說話
Would you listen? Will you just listen?

79
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,040
我要說的是  外面還有其他東西
I'm trying to tell you there is something else out there.

80
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,660

What form did it take, like a bear?

Yes, but bigger, much bigger.

你認識那野獸嗎
You knew about this beast?

83
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,020
我覺得應該原路返回
I say we double back.

84
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,090
那會被獸人追上的
We will be run down by a pack of wolves.

85
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,940
有棟房子  離這不遠
There is a house, it's not far from here,

86
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,150
可供我們躲避
where we might take refuge.

87
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,580
誰的房子
Whose house?

00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,290
-是敵是友  -都不是
- A friend or foe? - Neither.

He will help us, or, he will kill us.

None.

That is our host.

他叫貝榮
His name is Beorn.

105
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,150
他是個變形人
And he's a skin-changer.

106
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,230
有時是頭壯碩的黑熊
Sometimes he's a huge black bear,

107
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,850
有時是個高大強壯的男人
sometimes he's a great strong man.

108
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,820
黑熊喜怒無常  但變成人  他還是講道理的
The bear is unpredictable, but the man can be reasoned with.

109
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,000
不過  他不太喜歡矮人
However, he's not over fond of Dwarves.

110
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,300
-他走了  -離門遠一點
- He's leaving. - Come away from there!

111

它不正常  這都不正常
It's not natural, none of it!

112
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,570
他肯定被黑魔法控制了
It's obvious, he's under some dark spell.

113
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,100
別犯傻  那是他自己的變形術
Don't be a fool. He's under no enchantment but his own.

114
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,020
好了  現在  大家休息吧
All right, now. Get some sleep, all of you.

告訴我  為什么褻瀆者阿佐格要追殺你
Tell me, why is Azorg the Defiler hunting you?

141
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:04,010
你認識阿佐格  怎么回事
You know of Azorg. How?

142
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:07,500
我的族人最先在山中定居
My people were the first to live in the mountains.

143
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,420
遠在獸人南下之前
Before the Orcs came down from the north.

144
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,540
褻瀆者幾乎殺光了我的家人
The Defiler killed most of my family.

145
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,620
只留了幾個做奴隸
But some he enslaved.

146
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,510
不是做苦力  明白嗎
Not for work, you understand?

147
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,060
是為了娛樂
But for sport.

148
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:28,670
他似乎覺得折磨變形人是種消遣
Caging skin-changers and torturing them seemed to amuse him.

149
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,850
還有像你這樣的人嗎
There are others like you?

150
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,930
曾經有很多
Once there were many.

151
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,170
現在呢
And now?

152
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,270
只剩一個了
Now there's only one.

153
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,360
你們要在秋天結束前抵達孤山
You need to reach the mountain before the last days of autumn.

154
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,680
對  在杜林之日前
Before Durin's Day falls, yes.

155
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,580
你們沒多少時間了
You're running out of time.

156
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,120
所以我們必須穿過黑森林
Which is why we must go through Mirkwood.

157
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,960
有陰影籠罩著黑森林
A darkness lies upon that forest.

158
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,580
邪惡在林間滋生
Foul things creep beneath those trees.

159
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,090
墨瑞亞的獸人和多爾戈多的亡靈法師
There is an alliance between the Orcs of Moria

160
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:08,180
結成了同盟
and the Necromancer in Dol Guldur.

161
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,340
我不會冒險去那里  除非迫不得已
I would not venture there, except in great need.

162
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,020
我們走精靈之路  那里再安全不過
We will take the Elven road. That path is too safe.

163
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,360
安全
Safe?

164
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,660
木精靈與其他精靈不同
The Wood-elves in Mirkwood are not like their kin.

165
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,220
他們沒那么睿智  卻更加危險
They're less wise and more dangerous.

166
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,490
但這不重要
But it matters not.

167
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,450
什么意思
What do you mean?

168
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:34,110
這片土地到處都是獸人
These lands are crawling with Orcs.

169
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,660
他們的數量越來越多
Their numbers are growing.

170
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:42,730
你們徒步前行  永遠到不了森林的
And you're on foot, you will never reach the forest alive.

171
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,480
我不喜歡矮人
I don't like Dwarves.

172
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,630
他們貪婪又盲目
They are greedy, and blind.

173
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,880
瞧不起他們眼中的劣等生物
Blind to the lives of those they deem lesser than their own.

174
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,060
但我更恨獸人
But Orcs I hate more.

175
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,140
你們需要什么
What do you need?

176
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,960
快走吧  趁著天色還早
Go now, while you have the light.

177
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,450
追殺你們的人就在后面
Your hunters are not far behind.

178
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,470
精靈之門
The Elven Gate.

179
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,750
這就是去往黑森林的路
Here lies our path through Mirkwood.

180
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:57,700
沒有獸人的蹤跡  算我們走運
No sign of the Orcs. We have luck on our side.

181
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:09,450
把馬匹放走  讓它們去找主人
Set the ponies loose. Let them return to their master.

182
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,480
這座森林好像
This forest feels...

183
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,710
病了
sick.

184
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,530
像是被疾病困擾
As if there's a disease lies upon it.

185
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,850
沒有其他路可走了嗎
Is there no way around?

186
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,670
除非往北走200英里  或往南走...
Not unless we go to 200 miles north, or twice that distance...

187
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,110
400英里
south.

188
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,610
陰影中有股力量蠢蠢欲動
Something moves in the shadows unseen,

189
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,580
躲避我們的耳目
hidden from our sight.

190
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,060
它的力量日漸強大
Every day it grows in strength.

191
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,270
小心那個亡靈法師
Beware the Necromancer.

192
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,270
他可不簡單
He's not what he seems.

193
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,220
如果敵人歸來了  一定要通知我
If our enemy has returned, we must know.

194
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,910
快去山中的戒靈墳墓
Go to the tombs in the mountains.

195
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,190
高丘
The High Fells.

196
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,650
好吧
So be it.

197
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,260
我還要騎馬  等等
Not my horse, I need it.

198
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,960
你不是要離開吧
You're not leaving us?

199
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,580
我也是迫不得已
I will not do this unless I had to.

200
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:55,010
你變了  比爾博·巴金斯
You've changed. Bilbo Baggins.

201
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,390
不是離開夏爾時的那個霍比特了
And not the same Hobbit as the one who left Shire.

202
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,980
我本來想告訴你...
I was going to tell you...

203
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:14,080
我在半獸人的隧道里發現了一樣東西
I found something in the Goblin Tunnels.

204
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,450
什么東西
Found what?

205
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,700
你發現了什么
What did you find?

206
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,810
我的勇氣
My courage.

207
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,020
很好  很不錯
Good. Well that's good.

208
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,660
你需要勇氣
You need it.

209
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,280
我在艾雷博山前的瞭望角等你們
I'll be waiting for you at the overlook before the slopes of Erebor.

210
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,020
小心保管地圖和鑰匙
Keep the map and key safe.

211
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,340
不要擅自進入孤山
Do not enter the Mountain without me.

212
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,200
這可不是綠林
This is not the Greenwood.

213
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,050
森林的空氣中充斥著幻象
Although the very air of the forest is heavy

214
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,190
侵蝕你們的意志
with illusion that'll see to enter your mind...

215
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,460
引你們誤入歧途
and lead you astray.

216
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,080
誤入歧途
Lead us astray?

217
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,810
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

218
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,860
必須沿著路走  不要離開
You must stay on the path, do not leave it.

219
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,450
否則就再也找不到路了
If you do, you'll never find it again.

220
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,850
不管發生什么  務必沿著路走
No matter what may come, stay on the path!

221
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,990
走吧  要在杜林之日的日落前趕到孤山
Come on, we must reach the mountain before the sunset on Durin's Day.

222
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,780
杜林之日
Durin's Day?

223
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,060
-走吧  -我們只有一次機會找到隱秘之門
- Let's go. - We have one chance to find the hidden door .

224
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,370
路往這邊拐了
The path goes this way.

225
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,700
這邊
This way.

226
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,990
空氣  我需要空氣
Air. I need air.

227
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,400
我的腦袋在打轉  怎回事
My head, it's spinning. What's happening?

228
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,130
-繼續走  -諾瑞
- We're moving. - Nori.

229
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,420
為什么停下來
Why have we stopped?

230
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,440
路徑消失了
The path, it's disappeared.

231
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,220
怎么了
What's going on?

232
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,640
路不見了
We've lost the path.

233
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,050
那就找  大家一起找
Find it. All of you, look! Look for the path!

234
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,710
我不記得這地方  從來沒見過
I don't remember this place, none of it is familiar.

235
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,860
在哪里
Where is it?

236
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,850
不知道  我們連這是哪都不知道
We do not know. We do not even know what it is.

237
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,460
看  煙草袋
Look, a tobacco pouch.

238
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,370
這森林里有矮人
There's Dwarves in these woods.

239
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,890
而且還是藍山的矮人
Dwarves in the Blue Mountains no less.

240
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,090
這和我的煙草袋一模一樣
This is exactly the same as mine.

241
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,550
因為就是你的
Because it is yours.

242
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:01,140
明白嗎  我們在繞圈子  我們迷路了
You understand? We are going round in circles, we are lost.

243
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,950
我們沒有迷路  我們在往東走
We're not lost, we keep heading east.

244
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,250
但哪面是東
But which way is the east?

245
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,190
我們看不見太陽
We've lost the sun.

246
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,530
太陽  要找到太陽
The sun, we have to find the sun.

247
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,650
在上面
Up there.

248
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,260
那是什么
What's that?

249
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,840
夠了  都給我安靜
Enough! Quiet, all of you!

250
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,840
有人在盯著我們
We're being watched.

251
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,020
我看見了湖
I, I can see a lake.

252
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,820
和一條河
And a river,

253
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,320
還有孤山
and the Lonely Mountain.

254
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,560
我們就快到了
We're almost there.

255
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,120
你們能聽見嗎
Can you hear me?

256
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,330
我知道路了
I know which way to go.

257
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,040
人呢
Hello?

258
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,580
有人嗎
Hello.

259
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,010
不  別啊
No, come on!

260
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,390
趕緊吃  都跑不掉了
Eat them now, none is running.

261
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:56,450
他的皮很硬  里面肯定多汁
His hide is tough, this could be juicy inside.

262
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:58,760
殺了他
Finish it.

263
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,410
他還活著  你沒殺掉他
He's alive, you didn't kill him.

264
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,910
趕緊殺了他
Kill him now!

265
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:10,370
開吃
Feast!

266
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,850
開吃
Feast!

267
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:21,880
什么東西
What is it?

268
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,920
不欺負你
Fair terms, you see.

269
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,380
只嘗一小口
Just a little taste.

270
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:51,290
什么東西  在哪兒  在哪兒
Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?

271
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,280
在這里
Here.

272
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,940
刺到我了  疼死我了
It stings, stings!

273
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,310
刺
Sting?

274
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,570
這名字不錯
It's a good name.

275
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,890
刺叮劍
Sting.

276
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,410
-我沒事  -比爾博在哪兒
- I'm all right. - Where's Bilbo?

277
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,140
-比爾博  -我在上面
- Bilbo. - I'm up here.

278
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,120
拉
Haul!

279
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,420
在哪兒  到哪兒去了  掉哪兒去了
Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?

280
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,700
不
No!

281
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,530
格羅因  奇力
Gloin! Kili!

282
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,000
殺光它們
Kill them all!

283
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,250
奇力
Kili!

284
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,040
是我的
Mine.

285
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,630
快  跟上
Come on, keep up!

286
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,730
別以為我不會下殺手  矮人
Do not think I will not kill you, Dwarf.

287
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,710
我樂意之極
It would be my pleasure.

288
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,530
-不  -奇力
- No! - Kili!

289
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,620
把你的匕首扔給我
Throw me your dagger!

290
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,280
快點
Quick!

291
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,750
你以為我會給你武器嗎  矮人
Did you think I'm giving you a weapon, Dwarf?

292
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,420
你想錯了
You're mistaken!

293
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,220
搜身
Search them.

294
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,920
還給我  這是私人物品
Hey, give it back, that's private!

295
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,240
這是誰  你的弟弟嗎
Who is this? your brother?

296
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,630
那是我老婆
That is my wife!

297
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:21,050
這長得像半獸人的是誰  這么丑
And what is this horrid creature, a Goblin-mutant?

298
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,490
{\an8}指環王三部曲中的矮人戰士  后與萊戈拉斯成為摯友

299
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,490
那是我家兒子  金靂
That's my wee lad, Gimli!

300
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,650
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}蜘蛛都死了嗎

301
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,380
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}是的  但還會有的

302
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,490
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}它們越來越放肆了

303
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:48,090
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}這是上古精靈寶劍

304
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:53,130
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}我的族人打造的

305
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,320
你從哪得到的
Where did you get this?

306
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,130
別人送的
It was given to me.

307
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:04,810
不但是個賊  還是個騙子
Not just a thief but a liar as well.

308
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,610
<i>帶他們走
Enwenno hain!</i>

309
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,530
索林  比爾博去哪了
Thorin, where's Bilbo?

310
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,080
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}關上大門

311
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:16,870
跟你們沒完
This is not the end of it!

312
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,440
你不來搜我的身嗎
Aren't you going to search me?

313
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,200
我褲襠里可能什么都有哦
I could have anything down my trousers.

314
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,280
或是什么都沒有
Or nothing.

315
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:48,540
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}那矮人為什么盯著你看  塔睿爾

316
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,660
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}誰知道

317
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:54,420
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}他倒是個挺高的矮人

318
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,320
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}你說呢

319
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,290
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}是比一般的矮人高

320
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,090
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}但還是一樣丑

321
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,750
放棄吧
Leave it!

322
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:17,760
逃不出去的  這不是半獸人的地牢
There is no way out, this is no Orc dungeon.

323
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,450
這里是林地王國的牢房
These are holes of the Woodland Realm.

324
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:24,660
沒有國王的恩準  誰也不出去
No one leaves here but by the King's consent.

325
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,070
有人覺得這是什么崇高的使命
Some imagine that a noble quest is at hand.

326
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:38,860
收復家園  消滅惡龍
A quest to reclaim a homeland, and slay a dragon.

327
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,250
但我覺得你們沒有這么高尚
I myself suspect a more prosiac motive.

328
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:49,260
你們只能干偷雞摸狗的勾當
Attempted burglary or something of that ilk.

329
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,380
你找到了進山的方法
You have found a way in.

330
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:58,900
你在找能賦予你王權的寶物
You seek that which would bestow upon you, the right to rule.

331
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,410
帝王珍寶
The King's Jewel.

332
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,250
阿肯寶鉆
The Arkenstone.

333
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:09,140
在你眼中是無價之寶
It is precious to you beyond measure.

334
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,290
我能夠理解
I understand that.

335
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:16,750
山中眾多寶石  我也覬覦已久
The gems in the Mountain that I, too, desire...

336
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:21,320
白色的寶石  如同純潔的星光
White gems, a pure starlight.

337
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,680
我可以幫你
I offer you my help.

338
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:28,730
請說吧
I'm listening.

339
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,010
我會放你們走
I would let you go,

340
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,760
但要把我的財寶還給我
if you but return what is mine.

341
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,710
公平交換
A favor for a favor.

342
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:44,420
王者之間的約定
Have my word, one king to another.

343
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:52,240
哪怕世界毀滅
I would not trust Thranduil,

344
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:57,860
我也不會相信瑟蘭迪爾  這位國王的承諾
a great king to honor his words till the end of all days be upon us.

345
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,790
你不值得信任
You lack all honor!

346
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,410
我看到過你怎樣對待盟友
I've seen how you treat your friends.

347
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,820
我們找到你
We came to you once,

348
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,180
饑腸轆轆  無家可歸  渴求你的幫助
starving, homeless , seeking your help.

349
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,630
你卻袖手旁觀
But you turned your back.

350
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:17,710
你轉身離去  讓我的人民飽受煎熬
You turned away from the suffering of my people.

351
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,210
面對毀滅家園的地獄之火
The inferno that destroyed us.

352
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,710
<i>葬身火海
Imrid amrad ursul!</i>

353
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,730
不要跟我說龍火
Do not talk to me of dragon fire.

354
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:28,590
我體會過它的力量
I know its wrath and ruin.

355
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,180
我也斗過北方的惡龍
I have faced the great serpents of the north.

356
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:43,380
我警告過你的祖父  他的貪婪必會引來惡果
I warned your grandfather of what his greed would summon.

357
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,290
但他充耳不聞
But he would not listen.

358
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,020
你和他一樣
You are just like him.

359
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,000
在這里待到尸骨無存吧
Stay here if you will, and rot.

360
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:03,610
100年對精靈來說  只是一瞬間
100 years is a mere blink in the life of an Elf.

361
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:08,260
我有的是耐心  我會等的
I am patient. I can wait.

362
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,370
-他向你提條件了嗎  -提了
- Did he offer you a deal? - He did.

363
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:23,850
我<i>唾棄了他的先祖</i>
I told him he can go <i>ish kakhfê ai'd dur rugnu!</i>

364
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,110
還有他的族人們
Him and all his kin!

365
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:28,980
好吧
That's that, then.

366
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,170
那是我們唯一的希望了
The deal was our only hope.

367
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,180
還不是唯一的
Not our only hope.

368
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,580
我知道你在那
I know you're there.

369
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:51,390
為什么要在陰影中徘徊
Why do you linger in the shadows?

370
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,650
我是來向您報告的
I was coming to report to you.

371
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,800
我兩日前就下令要你摧毀那個巢穴了吧
I thought I ordered that nest to be destroyed not 2 moons past.

372
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,010
森林已經掃蕩過了  主上
We cleared the forest as ordered, my lord.

373
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,520
但還有蜘蛛不斷從南邊涌入
But more spiders keep coming up from the south.

374
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,590
他們在多爾戈多的廢墟中繁殖
They are spawning in the ruins of Dol Guldur.

375
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,230
如果能從源頭上扼制住他們
If we could kill them at their source...

376
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:10,530
他們的堡壘遠在邊界之外
The fortress lies beyond our borders.

377
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,470
避免邪惡生物侵入我們的領土
Keep our lands clear of those foul creatures.

378
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,820
這才是你的工作
That is your task.

379
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,140
就算趕跑了又怎樣
And when we drive them off? What then?

380
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,320
他們難道不會跑到其他地方去嗎
Will they not spread to other lands?

381
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,390
其他地方不關我的事
Other lands are not my concern.

382
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:24,720
外面的世界潮起潮落
Fortunes of the world will rise and fall.

383
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,870
只有我們的國度永在
But here in this kingdom, we will endure.

384
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,340
萊戈拉斯說你今天非常英勇
Legolas said you fought well today.

385
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,080
他對你是漸生好感
He's grown very fond of you.

386
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,370
我向您保證  主上
I assure you, my lord.

387
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,820
在他眼里  我只不過是個衛隊長
Legolas thinks of me as no more than a captain of the guard.

388
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,640
也許以前是
Perhaps he did once.

389
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,340
現在可不一定了
Now I'm not so sure.

390
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,740
我想您不會允許自己的兒子
I do not think you would allow your son

391
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,150
對出身卑微的木精靈有好感吧
to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan Elf.

392
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,560
沒錯  我不會允許
No, you're right. I would not.

393
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,890
但他還是很在乎你
Still, he cares about you.

394
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,830
沒有希望  就不要讓他幻想
Do not give him hope where there is none.

395
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,700
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}門口有人守衛

396
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:24,920
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}他們人數不足  跟我來

397
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:33,340
{\an8}歸來吧  innikh dê

398
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:53,840
你手里的那枚石頭是什么
The stone in your hand, what is it?

399
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,460
是個護身符
It is a talisman.

400
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:02,720
上面刻著強大的咒語
A powerful spell lies upon it,

401
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,050
只要不是矮人  看到咒語
if any but a Dwarf reads the runes on this stone...

402
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,250
就會受到永恒的詛咒
They will be forever cursed.

403
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,860
也沒準
Or not.

404
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,780
信則靈  不信則不靈
Depending on whether you believe.

405
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,310
這種東西只是個象征
This kind of thing is just a token.

406
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,520
符文石
A rune stone.

407
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,630
我媽媽給我的  好讓我記得承諾
My mother gave it to me so I'd remember my promise.

408
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:31,620
什么承諾
What promise?

409
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:33,720
我會回到她身邊
That I would come back to her.

410
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,720
她很擔心
She worries.

411
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,670
她覺得我很魯莽
She thinks I'm reckless.

412
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:42,630
是嗎
Are you?

413
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:59,700
好盛大的宴會
Sounds like quite a party having out there.

414
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,200
那是<i>星光盛宴</i>
It is <i>mereth en gilith</i>.

415
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,960
在星光下的晚宴
The feast of starlight.

416
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,360
<i>精靈</i>認為光都是神圣的
All light is sacred to the <i>Eldar</i>.

417
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:12,350
但木精靈最愛的是星光
But Wood Elves love best for light of the stars.

418
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:15,690
我一直覺得星光是清冷的
I always thought it is a cold light.

419
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,020
遙不可及
Remote and far away.

420
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:21,980
那是回憶
It is memory.

421
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,160
純潔寶貴
Precious and pure.

422
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,310
像你的承諾一樣
Like your promise.

423
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:42,640
我上去過幾次
I have walked there sometimes.

424
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:46,090
森林上面  深入夜色
Beyond the forest and up into the night.

425
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,440
遠遠地看著整個世界
I have seen the world full away.

426
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:54,620
夜空中充滿了白色的光輝
And the white light forever fill the air.

427
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:00,280
我見過一次焰月
I saw fire moon once.

428
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,940
在登蘭德附近的路上
The roads of the path near Dunland.

429
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:07,050
巨大的月亮  火紅金燦的光芒
Huge, red and golden it was, filled the sky.

430
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:11,050
我們當時護送一批梅督林的商人
We were an escort for some merchants in Mindolluin,

431
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:14,000
他們用銀器換皮毛
they were trading in silver work for furs.

432
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,720
我們沿著綠色大道南下
We took the Greenway south.

433
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:18,330
山一直在我們左側
Keeping the mountain to our left.

434
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,160
日暮之后
At the end of the day,

435
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,380
一輪巨大的焰月  照亮我們的路
you see huge fire moon lighting our path.

436
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,630
我們的酒快喝完了
We're running out of drink.

437
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,880
這些空酒桶早就該送回埃加洛斯了
These empty barrels should be sent back to Esgaroth hours ago.

438
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,570
駁船工肯定在等了
Bargeman would be waiting for them.

439
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:37,950
隨你怎么說
Say what you like,

440
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:41,430
咱的臭脾氣國王藏的美酒不能放過
but the ill-tempered king has this excellent, tasty wine.

441
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,920
-來吧  羅斯 嘗一下  -我還要看管矮人呢
- Come on, Ross, try it. - I have the Dwarves in my charge.

442
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:49,760
都被鎖起來了  還能跑到哪去
They're locked up, where can they go?

443
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,850
我敢打賭就要日出了  肯定快到黎明了
I'll wager the sun is on the rise. Must be nearly dawn.

444
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,850
我們是不是永遠都到不了孤山了
We never gonna reach the mountain, are we?

445
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,500
關在這里怎么去孤山
Not stuck in here, you know?

446
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:12,800
比爾博
Bilbo.

447
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,650
附近有衛兵
There are guards nearby.

448
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:38,690
這是什么
What's this?

449
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:39,590
你先走
You first.

450
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,090
-歐瑞  -不是那邊  在下面  跟我來
- Ori. - Not that way. Down here, follow me!

451
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:01,700
這邊
This way.

452
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:07,810
-快來  -我們居然跑到酒窖來了
- Come. - I don't believe we're in the cellars!

453
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,040
你應該帶我們找出去的路
You're supposed to be leading us out now for the road!

454
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,300
我腦子清楚得很
I know what I'm doing.

455
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:13,460
這邊
This way.

456
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,520
所有人  快進酒桶  快點
Everyone, climb into the barrels, quickly!

457
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,530
你瘋了嗎  他們會發現我們的
Are you mad? They'll find us.

458
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,220
不  不  不會的  我保證
No, no, they won't. I promise you!

459
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:28,280
拜托  一定要相信我
Please, please, you must trust me!

460
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,130
按他說的做
Do as he says.

461
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:53,960
我們現在該干什么
What do we do now?

462
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,330
屏住呼吸
Hold your breath.

463
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,180
屏住呼吸  什么意思
Hold my breath? What do you mean?

464
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,740
鑰匙在誰手里
Where is the keeper of the keys?

465
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:54,540
歡迎  巴金斯大師
Welcome, Master Baggins.

466
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,350
快點  出發了
Come on, let's go.

467
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:09,190
抓穩了
Hold on!

468
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,230
比爾博
Bilbo!

469
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:28,730
堅持住
Hang on.

470
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,620
不  救命啊
No. Help!

471
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:38,550
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}關閘門

472
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,020
不要
No!

473
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:12,910
小心
Watch out!

474
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:32,620
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}全殺光

475
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,940
去橋上
Get on to the bridge!

476
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,180
奇力
Kili?

477
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:22,090
奇力
Kili?

478
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:39,590
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}殺了她  殺了那個母精靈

479
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,720
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}追上他們

480
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:16,750
奇力
Kili?

481
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,490
諾瑞
Nori!

482
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:55,420
一起來
Come along!

483
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,470
邦伯
Bombur!

484
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,060
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}等等

485
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:47,720
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}不要殺他

486
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,700
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}追上去  攔住他們

487
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,470
是你啊
Oh, it's you.

488
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,090
為什么要我來這  甘道夫
Why am I here, Gandalf?

489
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,600
相信我  瑞達加斯特
Trust me, Radagast.

490
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,340
我不會無緣無故叫你來的
I would not have called you here without a good reason.

491
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:53,810
這里不適合見面
This is not a nice place to meet.

492
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:57,340
的確不適合
No. It is not.

493
00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:01,100
這里都是黑魔法  甘道夫
These are dark spells, Gandalf.

494
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,910
怨氣很重  古老的黑魔法
Old, and full of hate.

495
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,740
這里埋的是誰
Who's buried here?

496
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:09,400
就算他有名字  也早被人遺忘了
If he had name, it's long since been lost.

497
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:13,850
人們只會記得他是惡魔的仆從
He would have been known only as a servant of evil.

498
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:24,650
九個戒靈之一
One of nine.

499
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:30,500
為什么是現在  甘道夫  我不明白
Why now, Gandalf? I don't understand.

500
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,040
戒靈被召喚到了多爾戈多
The Ring-wraiths is summoned to Dol Guldur.

501
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,250
但不可能是亡靈法師
But it can not be the Necromancer.

502
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:38,790
人類不可能召喚出這么邪惡的東西
A human sorcerer could not summon such evil.

503
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,970
誰說他是人類
Who said it was human?

504
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:46,110
九個戒靈只效忠一人
The Nine only answer to one master.

505
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:48,980
我們沒有注意到  瑞達加斯特
We've been blind, Radagast.

506
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,990
敵人趁我們不備  卷土重來了
And in our blindness the enemy has returned.

507
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:58,190
他在召集他的仆從
He's summoning his servants.

508
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:03,150
褻瀆者阿佐格可不是普通的獵手
Azorg the Defiler is no ordinary hunter.

509
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:07,220
他是個指揮官  軍團指揮官
He's a commander, a commander of legions.

510
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,630
敵人要發動戰爭
The enemy is preparing for war.

511
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:17,200
從東邊起  他盯上了孤山
It will begin in the east. His mind is set upon that mountain.

512
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:18,490
你要去哪
Where are you going?

513
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:20,510
-和其他人匯合  -甘道夫
- To rejoin the others. - Gandalf.

514
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:24,460
是我牽的頭  我不能拋棄他們
I started this, I can not forsake them.

515
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:26,430
他們危在旦夕了
They are in grave danger.

516
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:27,960
如果你說的是真的
If what you say is true...

517
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:31,250
整個世界都危在旦夕了
the world is in grave danger.

518
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,980
他藏在堡壘中積蓄力量
The power in that fortress will only grow stronger.

519
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:40,080
你想讓我把朋友們拋到一旁
You want me to cast my friends aside.

520
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,000
-還有人追嗎  -我看沒有了
- Anything behind us? - Not that I can see.

521
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:52,470
應該甩掉獸人了
I think we've outrun the Orcs.

522
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,340
只能逃一時
Not for long.

523
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:55,740
這里水流太緩
We've lost the current.

524
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,820
大家上岸  來吧  我們走
Make for the shore. Come on, let's go.

525
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:07,280
加油
Come on.

526
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,720
我沒事  小傷而已
I'm fine. It's nothing.

527
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,580
-走起來  -奇力受傷了  腿需要包扎
- On your feet. - Kili's wounded, his leg needs binding.

528
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:28,380
有一隊獸人跟在我們后面  得趕緊走了
There's an Orc pack on our tail. We keep moving.

529
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:31,020
-去哪  -去孤山  我們很近了
- To where? - To the mountain, we're so close.

530
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,660
中間隔著一座湖呢
A lake lies between us and that mountain.

531
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:36,440
我們沒有辦法渡湖
We have no way to cross it.

532
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:40,120
-那我們就繞過去  -獸人肯定會追上來
- So then we go arround. - The Orcs'll run us down, as sure as daylight.

533
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:42,910
我們也沒有防身的武器
We have no weapon to defend ourselves.

534
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:46,750
快包扎他的腿  給你兩分鐘時間
Bind his legs quickly. You have 2 minutes.

535
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:10,460
我不會再手下留情了
Do it again...and you're dead.

536
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:15,960
不好意思  你是從長湖城來的
Excuse me, but, um...you're from Lake-town,

537
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,260
我沒看錯吧
if I'm not mistaken?

538
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:20,410
那邊的駁船
That barge over there,

539
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:24,300
有沒有可能租給我們
is it available for hire by any chance?

540
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,110
你為什么覺得我會幫你們
What makes you think I would help you?

541
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,860
從靴子看  你過的日子挺苦
Those boots have seen better days.

542
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,390
從大衣看也是
As has that coat.

543
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:35,700
想必你還要養家糊口吧
No doubt you have some hungry mouths to feed.

544
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:38,070
幾個孩子
How many bearings?

545
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,480
一個男孩兩個女孩
A boy and two girls.

546
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:43,920
我猜你妻子肯定是個大美人
And your wife, I imagine she's a beauty.

547
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:48,130
對  曾經是
Aye, she was.

548
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:52,680
對不起  我不是故意的
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

549
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:56,050
得了  得了  客套個什么勁
Come on, come on. Enough for the niceties!

550
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,750
你著什么急
What's your hurry?

551
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:59,020
關你什么事
What's it to you?

552
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:01,150
我想知道你們是什么人
I would like to know who you are.

553
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:03,800
又在這里做些什么事情
And what you are doing in these lands.

554
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,860
我們是從藍山來的商人
We are simple merchants from the Blue Mountains.

555
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:10,250
要去鐵丘陵走親戚
Journeying to see our kin in the Iron Hills.

556
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,460
你們說是普通商人
Simple merchants you say.

557
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:17,200
我們需要食物  補給和武器
We need food, supplies, weapons.

558
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:18,740
你能幫忙嗎
Can you help us?

559
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,580
我知道這些木桶是哪來的
I know where these barrels came from.

560
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:27,350
怎么了
What of it?

561
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,140
我不知道你們和精靈之間發生了什么
I don't know what business you had with the Elves.

562
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:32,610
但我覺得結果不太妙
But I don't think it ended well.

563
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:36,830
除非城主帶路  沒有人進得了長湖城
No one enters Lake-town but by lead of The Master.

564
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:40,620
他的收入全靠和林地王國的交易
All his wealth comes from trades with the Woodland Realm.

565
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,550
他肯定會把你們扔進牢房
He would see you in irons

566
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:44,330
不敢招惹瑟蘭迪爾國王
before risking the wraith of king Thranduil.

567
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:52,230
我打賭肯定有悄悄進城的方法
I'll wager there are ways to enter that town unseen.

568
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,170
對
Aye.

569
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:59,420
但要有個走私販幫忙
But for that, you would need a smuggler.

570
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,510
我們會付錢的  雙倍
For which we will pay, double.

571
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:12,470
邪惡就是如此愚蠢
Such is the nature of evil.

572
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:18,030
即使遍布中土  依舊閉塞盲目
Out there in the vast ignorance of the world it festers and spreads.

573
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:21,050
有陰影在黑暗中成長
A shadow that grows in the dark.

574
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:23,110
那惡靈晝夜不休
A sleepless malice

575
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:26,420
如夜幕一般黑暗
as black as the oncoming wall of night.

576
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:32,360
之前是這樣  以后也永遠會這樣
So it ever was. So will it always be.

577
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:37,470
最后  所有的邪惡都會現身
In time, all foul things come forth.

578
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:40,540
你們在追殺13個矮人
You were tracking a company of 13 Dwarves.

579
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:41,590
為什么
Why?

580
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:43,070
不是13個
Not 13.

581
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:44,710
不再是了
Not any more.

582
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,970
那個年輕人  黑頭發的弓箭手
The young one, the black-haired archer.

583
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:52,160
他中了魔窟的箭
We stuck him of a Morgul shaft.

584
01:02:53,230 --> 01:02:57,960
毒液滲入血液  他活不長了
Poison is in his blood, he'll be choking on it soon.

585
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:00,320
回答問題  渣滓
Answer the question, filth.

586
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:03,170
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}狗沒有權利問我問題  母精靈

587
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:07,930
最好別惹怒她
I would not antagonize her.

588
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:10,080
你喜歡殺戮嗎  獸人
You like killing things, Orc?

589
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:12,340
你喜歡死亡嗎
You like death?

590
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,060
那就讓你嘗嘗死亡的滋味
Then let me give it to you!

591
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:16,220
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}夠了

592
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:18,430
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}塔睿爾  走開

593
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,230
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}馬上

594
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:35,260
我不在乎矮人的死活  回答我的問題
I do not care about one dead Dwarf. Answer the question.

595
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:37,020
沒什么好害怕的
You have nothing to fear.

596
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:41,550
把知道的都說出來  我就放你自由
Tell us what you know and I will set you free.

597
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:44,530
有人要殺死他們  為什么
You had orders to kill them, Why?

598
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:47,020
索林·橡木盾對你們有什么用
What is Thorin Oakenshield to you?

599
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:50,430
那個矮冬瓜永遠別想當國王
The Dwarf runt will never be king.

600
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:52,700
國王嗎  沒有山下之王
King? There's no King Under the Mountain.

601
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:57,260
將來也不會有  只要那頭龍還活著
Nor will there ever be. None would they enter Erebor

602
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:58,730
沒人進得去艾雷博
whilst the dragon lives.

603
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:00,470
你知道什么
You know nothing.

604
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:03,300
你們的世界將化為火海
Your world will burn.

605
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:04,980
你在說什么
What are you talking about?

606
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,720
快說
Speak!

607
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,910
我們的時代又回來了
Our time has come again.

608
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:14,470
我的主人效忠于他
My master serves the One.

609
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:20,130
現在明白了吧  精靈  死亡就要到來了
Do you understand now, Elfling? Death is upon you.

610
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:24,710
戰火就要蔓延到這了
The flames of war are upon you.

611
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:28,530
你為什么這么做
Why did you do that?

612
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:30,400
你說過要放他自由
You promised to set him free.

613
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,190
我照做了
And I did.

614
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:36,890
我解放了他那卑鄙的頭顱
I freed his wretched head from his miserable shoulders.

615
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,530
這獸人嘴里還能套出話來
There was more the Orc could tell us.

616
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:43,300
我覺得沒什么價值了
There was nothing more he could tell me.

617
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:46,680
他說的戰火是什么意思
What did he mean by the flames of war?

618
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:49,800
他們要使用什么武器
It means they intend to unleash a weapon

619
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,880
這武器強大到可以毀滅一切
so great it will destroy all before it.

620
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:56,140
邊境  道路和河流的守衛通通加倍
I want the watch doubled at our borders, all roads, all rivers.

621
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:58,300
一有動靜  立即稟報
Nothing moves that I hear of it.

622
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:02,710
嚴禁任何人進出
No one enters this kingdom, and no one leaves it.

623
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:07,400
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}關閉城門

624
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:10,970
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}國王下令封城

625
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:12,840
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}那塔睿爾怎么辦

626
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:16,980
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}她怎么了

627
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:18,450
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}她帶著弓箭和匕首

628
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:21,210
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}跑進森林里去了

629
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:23,220
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}還沒有回來

630
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,840
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}矮人的血

631
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,380
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}他們經過這里

632
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:53,680
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}還有另一股味道

633
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,290
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}是人肉

634
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:06,360
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}他們找到渡湖的方法了

635
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:29,210
小心點
Watch out!

636
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,510
你干什么  想淹死我們嗎
What are you trying to do? Drown us?

637
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:43,200
這片水域生養了我  矮人老爺
I was born and bred on these waters , master Dwarf.

638
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:46,700
就算我想淹死你們  也不會選這里
If I wanted to drown you, I would not do it here.

639
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:51,300
我受夠這個長湖城的滑頭了
Oh, I've had enough of this slippy lake-man.

640
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:54,100
要我說直接丟掉他  甩了他
I say we throw him over the sail and then we dump him.

641
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,450
巴德  他叫巴德
Bard, his name is Bard.

642
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:57,380
你怎么知道的
How do you know?

643
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,000
我問的
Um, I asked him.

644
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,030
我才不管他叫什么  我不喜歡他
I don't care what he calls himself, I don't like him.

645
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:05,570
我們不需要喜歡他  付錢給他就行
We do not have to like him. We simply have to pay him.

646
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:08,560
來吧伙計  錢都拿出來
Come now lads, turn out your pockets.

647
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:11,600
我們怎么知道他不會背叛我們
How do we know he won't betray us?

648
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:12,900
不知道
We don't.

649
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:16,600
還有個大問題
There's um, still a big problem.

650
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:19,100
還差10枚銀幣
We're 10 coins short.

651
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:25,230
葛羅音  快點  把你的錢拿出來
Gloin, come on. Give us what you have.

652
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:26,830
找我干什么
Don't look to me.

653
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,990
這次冒險弄得我傾家蕩產
I've been bled dry by this venture.

654
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:34,020
一點回報都沒見到
What have I seen from my investment?

655
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:37,820
什么都沒有  只有痛苦和悲傷
Naught but misery and grief and...

656
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,880
老天爺啊
Bless my beard.

657
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:51,750
拿去  全都拿走
Take it, take all of it.

658
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,650
錢呢  快點給我
The money, quick, give it to me.

659
01:07:57,650 --> 01:07:59,420
拿到供給之后自然會付你錢
We will pay you when we get our provisions,

660
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:00,150
否則不行
but not before.

661
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:02,860
不想被關進大牢  就聽我的
If you value your freedom, you'll do as I say.

662
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:04,840
前面有守衛
There are guards ahead.

663
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,220
他在干什么
What's he doing?

664
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:26,420
他在和什么人說話
He's talking to someone.

665
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:30,480
還對著我們指指點點
He's pointing right at us.

666
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:34,870
現在握起手來了
Now they're shaking hands.

667
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:35,570
什么
What?

668
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:36,490
這個壞人
The villain!

669
01:08:36,490 --> 01:08:38,160
他把我們賣了
He's selling us out.

670
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:01,960
安靜
Quiet!

671
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:06,520
馬上到城門關了
We're approaching the tollgate.

672
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:22,450
停船  貨物檢查  請出示文書
Halt. Goods inspection. Papers, please.

673
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,770
原來是你啊  巴德
Oh, it's you, Bard.

674
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:25,890
早上好  珀西
Morning, Percy.

675
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:27,520
有什么要申報的嗎
Anything to declare?

676
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:31,840
沒有  我又累又冷  想趕緊回家
Nothing, that I am cold and tired, and ready for home.

677
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,450
我也是
You and me both.

678
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:39,810
給你  沒問題了
Here we are, all in order.

679
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:43,400
別著急
Not so fast.

680
01:09:43,530 --> 01:09:48,470
從林地王國托運回來的空木桶
Consignment of empty barrels from the Woodland Realm.

681
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:53,030
怎么不是空的呢
Only, they are not empty,

682
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:55,220
巴德
are they, Bard?

683
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:59,690
沒記錯的話  你的執照是駁船工
If I recall correctly. Your licensed as a bargeman.

684
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:04,020
而不是漁夫
Not a fisherman.

685
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:05,830
不關你的事
That's none of your business!

686
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:10,820
錯了  這關城主的事  也就是我的事
Wrong. It's the Master's business, which makes it my business.

687
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:13,230
拜托  埃弗雷德  講點情理  城民等著吃飯呢
Oh, come on, Alfred, Have a heart. People need to eat!

688
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:16,470
這些魚是非法的
These fish are illegal.

689
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:19,020
-把桶清空  -快點
- Empty the barrels over the side. - You heard him.

690
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:21,070
倒進河里
In the canal.

691
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:23,100
快點
Come on.

692
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,210
鎮上的人民在挨餓
Folks in this town are struggling.

693
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:29,230
日子艱難  食物又少
Times are hard, food is scarce.

694
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:30,840
跟我有什么關系
That's not my problem.

695
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:34,450
如果人們聽說城主把魚扔進湖里
And when the people hear their Master's dumping the fish in the lake,

696
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:37,210
掀起暴動的話
when the rioting starts,

697
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:41,340
跟你有關系了嗎
Will it be your problem, then?

698
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,240
住手
Stop!

699
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:55,230
充當人民英雄嗎  巴德  平民保護神
Ever the people's champion, aye, Bard? Protector of the common folk.

700
01:10:55,230 --> 01:10:58,510
他們不會一直支持你的  船夫
You might have their favor now, bargeman. But it won't last.

701
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:03,660
把門打開
Raise the gate.

702
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:10,070
別忘了  城主盯著你呢
The Master has his eye on you, you do well to remember.

703
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:11,650
我們知道你住哪里
We know where you live.

704
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:16,380
地方這么小  埃弗雷德  大家可都知根知底
It's a small town, Alfred. Everyone knows where everyone lives.

705
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,020
外面的動靜很大
All these talks of civil are unrest.

706
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:37,340
有人在煽風點火  大人
Someone's been stirring the pot, Sire.

707
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:41,620
痛風了嗎  大人
Gout playing ox, Sire?

708
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:46,050
是潮氣  肯定是潮氣  給我弄點白蘭地
It's the damp, it's the only possible explanation. Get me a brandy.

709
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:49,370
大人  民眾的情緒讓人不快
The mood of the people, sire, is turning ugly.

710
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:52,800
平民就這樣  埃弗雷德  讓人不愉快
They're commoners, Alfred. They've always been ugly.

711
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:57,340
這地方到處是魚腥臭氣  又不怪我
It's not my fault that they live in a place that stinks of fish oil and tar.

712
01:11:57,910 --> 01:11:59,720
工作  房屋
Jobs, shelter,

713
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:03,030
食物  只有這點追求
food, that's all they ever plead about.

714
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:07,100
大人  肯定有人在幕后指使
It is my belief, sire, that they've been led on by trouble makers.

715
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:11,710
那就給我找出來  逮捕他們
Then we must find these trouble makers, and arrest them.

716
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,810
我也是這么想的  大人
My thoughts exactly, sire.

717
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:17,280
改革的言論給我壓下去
And all these talks of change must be supressed.

718
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:21,070
絕對不能讓造反的人聚在一起  制造言論
What a fault to let the rebel banded together and start making noises.

719
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:26,030
搞不好他們還要問責  成立委員會
The next thing you know, they'll start asking questions, forming commities...

720
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,870
發起調查
launching inquiries.

721
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:31,930
舊的不去  新的不來
Out with the old, in with the new.

722
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,090
什么
What?

723
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,480
我一直都在這么說  大人
That's what I've been saying, sire.

724
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,780
還有傳言說要選舉
There's even talk of election.

725
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:42,730
選舉  真荒唐  我絕不允許
Election? It's absurd. I won't stand for it.

726
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:46,440
他們不需要您允許吧  大人
I don't think they'll ask you to stand, sire.

727
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:52,190
這些強盜  忘恩負義  還想造反
Sackers, ingrates, rebel-rousers.

728
01:12:52,190 --> 01:12:55,770
誰敢質疑我的權威
Who would have the nerve to question my authority!

729
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:58,450
誰敢  誰
Who would dare? Who...

730
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:04,710
巴德
Bard.

731
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:10,420
絕對沒錯  幕后黑手就是這個船夫
You mark my words, that trouble-making bargeman is behind all this.

732
01:13:18,290 --> 01:13:19,910
別碰我
Get your hands off me.

733
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:28,860
你沒見過他們  他們沒來過這里
You didn't see them. They were never here.

734
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,910
魚送你了
Fish you can have for nothing.

735
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:36,000
跟上我
Follow me.

736
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:49,320
爸  我們的房子被監視了
Da, our house, it's being watched.

737
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,080
告訴城主我今天辦完事了
You can tell the Master I'm done for the day.

738
01:14:28,190 --> 01:14:29,330
爸
Da.

739
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:30,940
你去哪了
Where have you been?

740
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:33,870
爸爸  你回來了  我好擔心
Father, there you are! I was worried.

741
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:37,810
好  貝恩  叫他們出來
Yes. Bain, get them in.

742
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:49,820
要是你跟別人說  我就把你的胳膊擰下來
If you speak of this to anyone. I'll rip your arms off.

743
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,660
別碰我
Off.

744
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:56,160
在那邊
Out there.

745
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:07,490
爸  為什么有矮人從廁所里爬出來
Da, why are the Dwarves climbing out from our toilet?

746
01:15:07,490 --> 01:15:09,050
他們能帶來好運嗎
Will they bring us luck?

747
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:16,060
可能不是很合身  但是保暖
They may not be the best fit, but they'll keep you warm.

748
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,110
謝謝
Thank you.

749
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,350
矮人風弩
The Dwarvish Windlass.

750
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,770
你像是見了鬼魂一樣
You look like you've seen a ghost.

751
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:38,080
沒錯  上次見到這武器
Yes. The last time we saw such a weapon,

752
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:41,410
河谷城化為了灰燼
a city was on fire.

753
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:44,670
那天巨龍襲來
It was the day the dragon came.

754
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:50,880
斯矛革摧毀了河谷城
The day that Smaug destroyed Dale.

755
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:55,420
城主吉利恩
Girion, the Lord of the city.

756
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:58,300
集結弓箭手射擊巨龍
Rallied his bowman to fire upon the beast.

757
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:03,380
但龍皮無比堅固  牢不可破
But a dragon's hide is tough. Tougher than the strongest armor.

758
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:08,500
只有風弩射出的黑箭能夠刺穿
Only a black arrow fired from a Windlass would pierce the dragon hide.

759
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:12,830
這種箭本就寥寥無幾
And few of those arrows were ever made.

760
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:22,260
吉利恩背水一戰時  僅剩數支
The store was running low when Girion made his last stand.

761
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:32,690
哪怕他能射中一箭
Had the aim of men been true that day...

762
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,320
也不會落到這步田地
much would've been different.

763
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:41,360
難道你當時在場
You speak as if you were there?

764
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,770
所有矮人都知道這個故事
All Dwarves know the tale.

765
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:47,340
那你應該知道吉利恩擊中了巨龍
And you would know that Girion hit the dragon?

766
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:49,050
射落了左翼的一塊鱗片
It loosened the scale on the left wing

767
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:52,030
再補一箭就能殺死那怪物
one more shot he would have killed the beast.

768
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:56,230
不過是童話而已  孩子  只是童話
That's fairy story, lad. Nothing more.

769
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:58,770
你收了錢
You took all our money.

770
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:01,290
武器在哪里
Where are the weapons?

771
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,860
等著
Wait here.

772
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:21,480
明天是最后一個秋日
Tomorrow begins our last day of autumn.

773
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,840
后天便是杜林之日
Durin's day falls the morning after next.

774
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:26,150
必須在那之前趕到孤山
We must reach the mountain before then.

775
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:27,480
如果不能呢
And if we do not?

776
01:17:27,570 --> 01:17:30,400
如果那之前找不到隱秘之門呢
If we fail to find the hidden door before that time?

777
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,300
那計劃就全落空了
Then this quest has been for nothing.

778
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:45,720
這是什么
What is this?

779
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:47,290
鉤矛
Pike hook.

780
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:49,370
舊魚叉改的
Made from an old harpoon.

781
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:50,120
這個呢
And this?

782
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:53,090
我們叫它鶴嘴鋤  改進過的鐵匠錘
A crowbill, we call it. Expansion from smittys hammer.

783
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,830
雖然上手很重
It's heavy in hand, I grant.

784
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:58,330
但需要保命時  也能湊合著用
But in defense of your life, these will serve you better than none.

785
01:17:58,330 --> 01:18:01,080
我們買的是武器
We paid you for weapons.

786
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:04,380
鐵鑄黑鞘的寶劍
Iron forged, swords of dark sheath.

787
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:05,630
這是開玩笑
It's a joke.

788
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:10,140
這是軍械庫外最好的武器了
You won't find better outside the city armory.

789
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:12,860
鐵鑄的兵器都鎖在軍械庫里
All iron-forged weapons are held there and locked in key.

790
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:14,310
索林
Thorin.

791
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:17,070
拿著這些走吧
Why not take his offer and go?

792
01:18:17,070 --> 01:18:19,570
更差的兵器我都用過  你不也是
I've made do with less. So have you.

793
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:22,420
我們現在就走
I say we leave now.

794
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:24,130
你們哪都不能去
You're not going anywhere.

795
01:18:24,210 --> 01:18:25,270
你看到什么了
What did you see?

796
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:29,400
全城的眼線  乃至狼狗都盯著這里
There are spies watching this house and probably every wolf and dog in town.

797
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:31,990
必須等到傍晚
You must wait until nightfall.

798
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:49,480
索林
Thorin.

799
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:03,660
爸
Da?

800
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:08,090
別讓他們出門
Don't let them leave.

801
01:19:33,370 --> 01:19:35,200
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}我還當你是獸人

802
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:37,200
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}如果我是獸人

803
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,740
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}你早就死了

804
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:45,360
不要一個人追殺30個獸人
You can not hunt 30 orcs on your own.

805
01:19:45,630 --> 01:19:47,380
可我不是一個人
But I'm not on my own.

806
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:49,880
你知道我要跟來
You knew I would come?

807
01:19:52,290 --> 01:19:54,370
國王很憤怒  塔睿爾
The king is angry, Tauriel.

808
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:57,900
600年來  我父親一直保護你  寵愛你
For 600 years, my father has protected you, favored you.

809
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,530
你卻違抗了他的命令
You defied his orders.

810
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:01,500
辜負了他的信任
You betrayed his trust.

811
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:04,360
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}跟我回去

812
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:06,110
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}他會原諒你的

813
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:07,750
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}但我不會

814
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,820
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}如果跟你回去  我不會原諒自己

815
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:13,880
國王從未準許獸人入境
The king has never let Orcs fill from outlands.

816
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:16,050
這次卻縱容他們穿越邊境
But he would let this Orc pack cross our borders

817
01:20:16,230 --> 01:20:17,430
追殺我們的犯人
and kill our prisoners.

818
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:20,610
-我們不該插手  -怎么不該插手
- It is not our fight. - It is our fight.

819
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:25,930
他們不會善罷甘休  這是在助長邪惡
It will not end here. With every victory this evil will grow.

820
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:29,160
如果你父親一意孤行  我們袖手旁觀
If your father has his way, we would do nothing.

821
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:34,020
我們只能躲在城墻后  不見天日
We will hide within our walls, live our lives away from light.

822
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:36,190
任由黑暗侵襲
And let the darkness descend.

823
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:39,530
我們不是中土世界的一員嗎
Are we not a part of this world?

824
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:45,540
<i>朋友</i>  怎么能讓邪惡力量比我們強大
Tell me <i>mellon</i>, when did we let evil become stronger than us?

825
01:20:50,670 --> 01:20:52,820
你好  巴德  你在找什么
Hello, Bard. What you after?

826
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:58,310
有一條舊掛毯  上哪去了
There was a tapestry, an old one. Where has it gone?

827
01:20:58,610 --> 01:20:59,910
什么舊掛毯
What tapestry are you talking about?

828
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:01,740
這條
This one.

829
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:05,000
告訴你  他們是矮人  憑空出現的
They were Dwarves, I tell you. Appeared out of nowhere.

830
01:21:05,210 --> 01:21:09,090
滿臉胡子  瞇縫眼  從來沒見過
Full-beards, pierced eyes. I've never seen the like.

831
01:21:09,410 --> 01:21:11,330
矮人在這做什么
What are Dwarves doing in these parts?

832
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:12,740
是預言
It's the prophecy.

833
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,280
-預言  -杜林后人的預言
- Prophecy? -Prophecy of Durin's folk.

834
01:21:24,890 --> 01:21:26,070
預言
Prophecy?

835
01:21:29,930 --> 01:21:30,890
預言
Prophecy.

836
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,670
那些傳說可能成真了
The old tales may come true.

837
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:35,100
大筆財寶
Vast hordes of treasure?

838
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:36,520
是真的嗎
Can it really be true?

839
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:39,270
銀泉之主回歸了嗎
Has the Lord of the silver fountains returned?

840
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:45,420
銀泉之主  刻石之王
The lord of the silver fountains. The king of carven stone.

841
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,160
山下之王
The King Beneath the Mountain.

842
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:51,560
將重回寶座
Shall come into his own.

843
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:57,300
人民歡慶山下之王的回歸
And the bell shall ring in gladness at the Mountain King's return.

844
01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:00,480
但一切必以悲劇收場
But all shall fail in sadness,

845
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:03,940
湖水閃耀  戰火重燃
and the lake will shine and burn.

846
01:22:06,370 --> 01:22:09,170
-爸  我想阻止他們  -他們走了多久
- Da, I tried to stopped them... - How long have they been gone?

847
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:18,120
拿到武器  直接去孤山
As soon we have the weapons we make straight for the Mountain.

848
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:19,520
快  快  快
Go, go, go.

849
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:39,760
你還好嗎
You all right?

850
01:22:40,310 --> 01:22:41,420
撐得住
I can manage.

851
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:43,730
我們趕緊走吧
Let's just get out of here.

852
01:22:58,270 --> 01:22:59,280
快跑
Run!

853
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,400
這什么意思
What is the meaning of this?

854
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:32,610
抓到他們在偷武器  大人
We caught them stealing weapon, sire.

855
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:35,480
這是全民公敵呀
Enemies of the state, em?

856
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:38,890
看樣子是群下賤的傭兵  大人
A disgrace bunch of mercenaries, if ever there were, Sire.

857
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,180
住嘴
Hold your tongue!

858
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:45,340
你不知道你在跟誰講話
You do not know to whom you speak.

859
01:23:45,790 --> 01:23:49,160
這哪是什么犯罪  他是索林
This is no common criminal! This is Thorin,

860
01:23:49,470 --> 01:23:52,620
瑟羅爾的后人  瑟萊因之子
son of Thrain, son of Thror!

861
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:57,390
我們是艾雷博的矮人
We are the Dwarves of Erebor.

862
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:03,380
我們來收復故土
We have come to reclaim our homeland.

863
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:10,990
我還記得這鎮子昔日的輝煌
I remember this town in the great days of old.

864
01:24:12,710 --> 01:24:14,540
碼頭停滿了船舶
Fleets of boats laid at the harbor,

865
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:17,040
滿載絲綢和珠寶
filled with silks and fine gems.

866
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,780
這里不是被人遺忘的湖邊小城
This was no forsaken town on a lake.

867
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:24,150
這里曾是北方的貿易中心
This was the center of all trade of the North.

868
01:24:25,940 --> 01:24:27,540
我要重現往日的輝煌
I would see those days return,

869
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:30,020
點亮矮人的熔爐
I would relive the great forges of Dwarves,

870
01:24:30,670 --> 01:24:33,130
讓艾雷博的商隊
send wealth and riches flowing once more...

871
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:34,670
載滿財富接踵而來
from the hordes of Erebor!

872
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:41,010
你只會帶來死亡
Death, that is what you will bring upon us.

873
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:44,880
龍火和毀滅
Dragon fire and ruin.

874
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:50,550
吵醒了那怪物  我們就全完了
If you awaken that beast, it will destroy us all.

875
01:24:51,010 --> 01:24:54,320
你們可以聽他勸阻  不過我保證
You can listen to this nay-sayer, but I promise you this:

876
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:58,350
如果成功
If we succeed,

877
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:02,510
孤山的財富大家可以一起分享
all will share in the wealth of the Mountain.

878
01:25:06,990 --> 01:25:11,330
到手的財富  可以讓十個埃加洛斯重現輝煌
You will have enough gold, to rebuild Esgaroth 10 times over.

879
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:16,940
所有人  聽我說  聽好
All of you, listen to me! You must listen!

880
01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:19,140
你們忘記河谷城的事了嗎
Have you forgotten what happened in Dale?

881
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:24,010
忘記葬身火海的百姓了嗎
Have you forgotten of those who died in firestorm?

882
01:25:26,510 --> 01:25:27,910
都是為了什么
And for what purpose?

883
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:31,500
為了山下之王盲目的野心
The blind ambition of a Mountain King.

884
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:35,450
貪婪蒙蔽了他的雙眼  他心里只有欲望
So riven by greed, he can not see beyond his own desire!

885
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,810
等一等  我們每個人
No, no. We must not, any of us,

886
01:25:41,070 --> 01:25:43,600
都不要急著橫加指責
be too quick to lay blame.

887
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:47,580
不要忘了  吉利恩
Let us not forget, that it was Girion,

888
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:50,900
河谷城主  你的先人
Lord of Dale, your ancestor,

889
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:53,340
沒能殺死那怪物
who failed to kill the beast.

890
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:59,610
沒錯  大人  我們都知道這個故事
It's true, sire. We all know the story.

891
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:05,480
他射了一箭又一箭  卻全部射偏
Arrow after arrow he shot, each one missing its mark.

892
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:13,740
你無權
You have no right,

893
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:17,250
無權進入孤山
no right to enter that mountain.

894
01:26:19,230 --> 01:26:20,930
只有我有權利
I have the only right.

895
01:26:27,490 --> 01:26:30,040
請問長湖城主
I speak to the Master of the men of the lake.

896
01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:32,530
您愿意見證預言成真嗎
Will you see the prophecy fulfilled?

897
01:26:34,090 --> 01:26:35,250
愿意
Will you...

898
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:39,490
分享我們的無盡財富嗎
share in the great wealth of our people?

899
01:26:44,210 --> 01:26:45,350
您怎么說
What say you?

900
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:54,710
我要說  歡迎
I say unto you, welcome!

901
01:26:55,650 --> 01:27:00,790
請平身  歡迎山下之王
Welcome and rise! Welcome, King under the mountain!

902
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:14,220
你知道我們少一個人吧
You do know we have one short?

903
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:16,810
-比弗在哪  -他不在也不要管他
- Where's Bifur? - He's not here, we leave him behind.

904
01:27:17,090 --> 01:27:20,030
想在日落前找到門  只能這么做
You'll have to, if you were to find the door before nightfall.

905
01:27:20,260 --> 01:27:21,900
我們拖不起了
We can risk no more delays.

906
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:27,370
你不能去
Not you.

907
01:27:27,990 --> 01:27:29,870
今天要全力趕路  你會拖慢我們的
We must travel with speed. You'll slow us down.

908
01:27:31,690 --> 01:27:33,130
你在說什么呢  我要跟你們走
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.

909
01:27:33,370 --> 01:27:34,350
不
No.

910
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,580
舅舅  我一定要看著那門打開
Uncle, I must be there when that door is open.

911
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,260
我們一定要一起仰望先祖的大廳  索林
When we first look upon the halls of our fathers, Thorin...

912
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:46,700
奇力  留下
Kili, stay here,

913
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:50,660
休息  痊愈后來找我們
rest, join us when you're healed.

914
01:27:56,410 --> 01:27:57,620
我來陪這孩子
I'll stay with the lad

915
01:27:57,850 --> 01:27:59,640
我的職責就是照顧傷員
my duty lies with the wounded.

916
01:27:59,890 --> 01:28:00,720
舅舅
Uncle.

917
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:04,790
我們是聽著孤山的故事長大的
We grew up with the tales of the Mountain, tales you told us.

918
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:06,470
不要剝奪他的夢想
You can't take that away from him.

919
01:28:06,670 --> 01:28:08,810
-奇力  -我可以背著他
- Kili. - I will carry him if I must!

920
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,320
等你坐上王位  就能理解了
One day you will be king and you will understand.

921
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:15,370
不能因為一個矮人耽擱了遠征
I cannot risk the fate of this quest for the sake of one Dwarf.

922
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:18,300
哪怕是我的親人
Not even my own kin.

923
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:25,150
菲力  別犯傻  你跟大家在一起
Fili, don't be a fool. You belong with the company.

924
01:28:25,290 --> 01:28:26,520
我要和弟弟在一起
I belong with my brother.

925
01:28:38,350 --> 01:28:41,370
難道要出發了嗎
By my beard, is that the time!

926
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:54,270
祝你們好運
Good fortune to all!

927
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:06,520
讓開
Move.

928
01:29:07,190 --> 01:29:08,000
不
No.

929
01:29:15,290 --> 01:29:16,680
你們也錯過開船了嗎
Did you miss the boarders as well?

930
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,080
奇力  奇力
Kili, Kili!

931
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:24,800
不  我受夠矮人了  走開
No. I'm done with Dwarves, go away.

932
01:29:25,010 --> 01:29:27,890
別  別  別  沒人肯幫我們
No, no, no. No one will help us.

933
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:29,000
奇力病了
Kili's sick.

934
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:33,290
是重病
He's very sick.

935
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:14,730
這是哪
What is this place?

936
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:19,860
曾經的河谷城  現在只是一片廢墟
For once the city of Dale. Now it is a ruin.

937
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,380
斯矛革留下的荒原
The desolation of Smaug.

938
01:30:23,630 --> 01:30:25,230
馬上到正午了
The sun will soon reach midday.

939
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:27,700
必須在日落前找到進入孤山的隱秘之門
We must find the hidden door into the Mountain before it sets.

940
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:29,410
-這邊  -等等
- This way. - Wait.

941
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:31,290
這里是瞭望角嗎
Is this the overlook?

942
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:33,770
甘道夫說無論如何  都要在這等...
Gandalf said to meet him here on no account of what you hear or...

943
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:37,380
你見到他了嗎  來不及等他了
Do you see him? We have no time to wait upon a wizard.

944
01:30:38,070 --> 01:30:38,960
我們只能靠自己了
We're on our own.

945
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:39,750
來吧
Come.

946
01:30:56,990 --> 01:31:01,110
多爾戈多  巫師之山
Dol Guldur, the hill of sorcerer.

947
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:03,510
看樣子廢棄已久了
It looks completely abandoned.

948
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:05,480
像是故意的
As it is meant to.

949
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:09,450
這是障眼法
A spell of concealment lies over this place.

950
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:13,920
敵人應該不想現出真身
Which means our enemies are not yet ready to reveal himself.

951
01:31:16,410 --> 01:31:19,790
他還沒恢復元氣
He has not regained his full strength.

952
01:31:20,290 --> 01:31:23,420
瑞達加斯特  給蓋拉德麗爾女王送個信
Radagast, I need you to carry a message to the Lady Galadriel.

953
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:26,000
告訴她  要逼他行動了
Tell her, we must force his hand.

954
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:27,070
你什么意思
What do you mean?

955
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:31,930
我獨自進去  千萬不要跟著我

There you are, a thief in the shadows.

1095
01:53:27,210 --> 01:53:29,690
我沒想偷東西
I did not come to steal from you.

1096
01:53:29,980 --> 01:53:33,630
無比富有的斯矛革
O Smaug, the unassessably wealthy.

1097
01:53:33,630 --> 01:53:36,460
我只想親眼目睹
I merely want to get eyes upon your magnificence.

1098
01:53:36,460 --> 01:53:40,750
傳說中偉岸的巨龍
To see if you really were as great as the old tales say.

1099
01:53:40,990 --> 01:53:42,630
我原來不相信
I did not believe them!

1100
01:53:51,910 --> 01:53:56,140
現在信了嗎
And do you now?

1101
01:53:57,190 --> 01:53:58,290
信了
Truly.

1102
01:53:59,740 --> 01:54:01,720
傳說和歌謠里的描述
The tales and songs...

1103
01:54:02,890 --> 01:54:08,680
在你一比真是相形見絀  龐然大物斯矛革
fall utterly short, of your enormity, O Smaug the stupendous!

1104
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:12,460
你覺得奉承我能活命嗎
Do you think flattery will keep you alive?

1105
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:13,660
不
No, no...

1106
01:54:13,660 --> 01:54:15,270
不能
No indeed.

1107
01:54:17,540 --> 01:54:20,990
你好像認識我
You seem familiar with my name.

1108
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:24,600
我卻不記得你的氣味
But I don't remember smelling your kind before.

1109
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:29,350
你是誰  哪里來的
Who are you? And where do you come from...

1110
01:54:29,350 --> 01:54:32,150
請問
may I ask?

1111
01:54:37,690 --> 01:54:38,810
我
I...

1112
01:54:41,450 --> 01:54:43,270
我來自山下
I came from under the hill.

1113
01:54:43,390 --> 01:54:44,700
山下
Under hill?

1114
01:54:48,620 --> 01:54:51,460
我翻山越嶺  跋山涉水
And under hills and over hills, my path is lead.

1115
01:54:52,620 --> 01:54:56,830
來去無蹤的我  穿梭到了這里
And, and through the air. I am here that He walks unseen.

1116
01:54:56,830 --> 01:55:01,710
厲害  你還有什么名號
Impressive, what else do you claim to be?

1117
01:55:01,710 --> 01:55:03,080
我是
I am...

1118
01:55:05,850 --> 01:55:07,180
好運隨身的人
luck-wearer...

1119
01:55:08,850 --> 01:55:13,800
-猜謎能手  -好名號  繼續
- Riddle-maker. - Lovely titles, go on.

1120
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:16,500
-酒桶騎士  -酒桶
- Barrel-rider. - Barrels.

1121
01:55:16,770 --> 01:55:18,660
有點意思了
Now that is interesting.

1122
01:55:20,140 --> 01:55:24,740
你的矮人朋友呢
And what about your little Dwarf friends?

1123
01:55:25,010 --> 01:55:27,390
都躲在哪里
Where are they hiding?

1124
01:55:28,590 --> 01:55:32,650
矮人  沒
D...dwarves? No...

1125
01:55:33,470 --> 01:55:36,540
哪有什么矮人  你弄錯了
No, no Dwarves here. You got that all wrong.

1126
01:55:36,550 --> 01:55:38,560
我不信
I don't think so.

1127
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:43,930
酒桶騎士  他們叫你來送死
Barrel-rider, they sent you in here to do their dirty work,

1128
01:55:43,930 --> 01:55:47,230
自己在外面做縮頭烏龜
while they skulk about outside.

1129
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:50,700
你真的錯了
Truly. You are mistaken...

1130
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:54,460
偉大的斯矛革  猛獸之王
O Smaug, chiefest and greatest of all calamities.

1131
01:55:54,460 --> 01:56:01,710
別看你偷東西還撒謊  倒是很有禮貌呢
You have nice manners for a thief and a liar.

1132
01:56:02,260 --> 01:56:06,150
我熟悉矮人的氣味和味道
I know the smell and taste of Dwarf.

1133
01:56:06,440 --> 01:56:08,500
無比熟悉
No one better.

1134
01:56:08,950 --> 01:56:10,690
是為了金子
It is the gold.

1135
01:56:10,820 --> 01:56:15,490
他們對黃金趨之若鶩
They are drawn to treasure like flies to dead flesh.

1136
01:56:18,420 --> 01:56:21,770
你以為我不知道嗎
Did you think I did not know this day would come?

1137
01:56:23,450 --> 01:56:26,520
我早料到這群虛偽小人
That a pack of canting dogs

1138
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:30,650
會偷偷潛回孤山
will come crawling back to the Mountain.

1139
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:38,590
-地震嗎  -孩子  這動靜
- Was that an earthquake? - That, my lad...

1140
01:56:41,940 --> 01:56:43,160
是龍
was a dragon.

1141
01:56:51,930 --> 01:56:54,490
-爸  -山那邊來的
- Da? - It's come from the mountain.

1142
01:56:58,570 --> 01:57:02,210
別管我們了  帶著孩子逃吧
You should leave us. Take your children, get out of here.

1143
01:57:02,410 --> 01:57:06,520
逃去哪里  無處可逃了
And go where? There is nowhere to go.

1144
01:57:08,190 --> 01:57:12,980
-我們會死嗎  爸  -不會  親愛的
- Are we going to die, da? - No, darling.

1145
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:15,700
火龍會殺掉我們
The dragon is going to kill us.

1146
01:57:26,180 --> 01:57:27,950
我會先殺掉它
Not if I kill it first.

1147
01:57:29,630 --> 01:57:35,280
山下之王已死  他的王位在我腳下
The King Under the Mountain is dead. I took his throne.

1148
01:57:35,490 --> 01:57:39,620
他的子民是我的點心
I ate his people like a wolf among sheep.

1149
01:57:43,130 --> 01:57:48,210
我肆意殺戮  隨心所欲
I kill where I wish, when I wish.

1150
01:57:48,250 --> 01:57:51,810
我的鱗甲堅如鋼鐵
My armor is iron!

1151
01:57:59,860 --> 01:58:03,310
堅不可摧
No blade can pierce me!

1152
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:10,370
-安全  -黑箭  你怎么不早說
- All right. - A black arrow. Why did you never tell me?

1153
01:58:10,370 --> 01:58:11,980
因為沒必要告訴你
Because you did not need to know.

1154
01:58:19,530 --> 01:58:23,320
好好聽我說  你去引開警衛
Listen to me carefully. I need you to distract the guards.

1155
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:27,550
我得上塔  將箭上弦
Once I'm at the top of the tower, I will set the arrow to the bow.

1156
01:58:27,550 --> 01:58:29,710
-他在這  -衛兵  抓住他
- There he is. - Guards, after him!

1157
01:58:29,710 --> 01:58:31,650
快  那邊
Quickly, down there! Go!

1158
01:58:31,750 --> 01:58:32,960
抓住他
Stop him!

1159
01:58:46,070 --> 01:58:47,570
貝恩  貝恩
Bain, Bain.

1160
01:58:48,570 --> 01:58:51,130
藏好  不能讓別人發現
Keep it safe, don't let anyone find it.

1161
01:58:51,730 --> 01:58:54,310
-我來對付他們  去吧  -我不走
- I'll deal with them. Now go! - I'm not leaving.

1162
01:58:58,240 --> 01:58:59,890
-拉加  -你被捕了
- Ragar. - You're under arrest.

1163
01:58:59,890 --> 01:59:03,010
-什么罪名  -那要聽城主的
- On what charge? - Any charge the Master chooses.

1164
01:59:45,510 --> 01:59:48,100
-比爾博怎么辦  -再給他點時間
- What about Bilbo? - Give him more time.

1165
01:59:48,130 --> 01:59:50,720
給他時間干嘛  送死嗎
Time to do what? To be killed?

1166
01:59:52,660 --> 01:59:57,710
-你怕了  -我是怕了
- You're afraid. - Yes, I'm afraid.

1167
01:59:58,980 --> 02:00:00,700
我替你擔心
I fear for you,

1168
02:00:01,580 --> 02:00:04,160
怕那寶藏迷人心智的魔力
the sickness the lies upon that treasure,

1169
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:06,690
那害你祖父癲狂的惡疾
a sickness which drove your grandfather mad.

1170
02:00:06,690 --> 02:00:08,420
我不是我祖父
I'm not my grandfather.

1171
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:09,950
你也不是你自己了
You're not yourself.

1172
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:13,460
我認識的索林從不畏縮
The Thorin I know would not hesitate to go in there.

1173
02:00:13,460 --> 02:00:18,410
不能因為一個盜賊耽誤了遠征
I will not risk this quest for the life of one burglar.

1174
02:00:20,210 --> 02:00:23,860
他有名字  叫比爾博
Bilbo, his name is Bilbo.

1175
02:00:26,830 --> 02:00:32,740
是橡木盾  妄圖篡權的卑鄙小人
It's Oakenshield, that filthy Dwarvish usurper!

1176
02:00:34,860 --> 02:00:40,610
他派你來偷阿肯寶鉆  對吧
He sent you here for the Arkenstone, didn't he?

1177
02:00:40,610 --> 02:00:41,890
不是
No, no, no...

1178
02:00:41,890 --> 02:00:44,260
你在說什么啊
I don't know what you're talking about.

1179
02:00:44,260 --> 02:00:46,320
不用否認
Don't bother denying it,

1180
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:49,150
我早看出他的禍心了
I guessed his foul purpose some time ago.

1181
02:00:51,350 --> 02:00:53,110
但無所謂
But it matters not.

1182
02:00:53,110 --> 02:00:57,380
橡木盾的遠征注定要失敗
Oakenshield's quest will fail.

1183
02:00:58,330 --> 02:01:00,510
黑暗到來了
A darkness is coming.

1184
02:01:00,940 --> 02:01:05,230
蔓延到了中土的每個角落
It was spread to every corner of the land.

1185
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:51,180
你被利用了  躲躲藏藏的小偷
You are being used, thief in the shadows.

1186
02:01:51,180 --> 02:01:54,720
你只是他們手里的工具
You are only ever a means to an end.

1187
02:01:55,660 --> 02:01:58,990
橡木盾那個膽小鬼
The coward Oakenshield has weighed

1188
02:01:58,990 --> 02:02:03,750
根本沒把你的小命當回事
the value of your life, and found it worth nothing.

1189
02:02:03,750 --> 02:02:04,750
不是的
No.

1190
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:08,970
你騙人
No, you're lying.

1191
02:02:08,970 --> 02:02:12,960
他怎么許諾的  要分你些財寶嗎
What did he promise you, a share of the treasure?

1192
02:02:13,660 --> 02:02:16,100
好像財寶是他的一樣
As if it was his to give.

1193
02:02:16,930 --> 02:02:20,330
你一枚金幣都不許帶走
I will not part with a single coin!

1194
02:02:20,330 --> 02:02:23,220
不許帶走
Not one piece of it.

1195
02:02:27,100 --> 02:02:33,670
我的利齒是寶劍  尖爪是長矛
My teeth are swords, my claws are spears.

1196
02:02:35,700 --> 02:02:39,690
雙翼一揮  暴風來襲
My wings, are a hurricane.

1197
02:02:45,730 --> 02:02:47,150
傳說是真的
So it is true.

1198
02:02:47,860 --> 02:02:51,070
-黑箭射中了你  -你說什么
- The black arrow found its mark. - What did you say?

1199
02:02:51,070 --> 02:02:54,880
沒什么  您果然名不虛傳
Nothing. I was just saying your reputation proceeds you,

1200
02:02:54,890 --> 02:02:57,560
暴君斯矛革
O Smaug the Tyrannical.

1201
02:02:57,780 --> 02:03:02,140
您真的是無可比擬
Truly, you have no equal on this earth.

1202
02:03:05,770 --> 02:03:09,940
我差點動心  讓你拿走寶鉆
I'm almost tempted to let you take it.

1203
02:03:09,940 --> 02:03:13,780
好讓橡木盾受折磨
If only to see Oakenshield suffer.

1204
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:17,270
看他走向毀滅
Watch it destroy him.

1205
02:03:17,890 --> 02:03:24,160
看他荒廢自己  日漸癲狂
Watch it corrupt his arms, and drive him mad.

1206
02:03:27,320 --> 02:03:31,880
不過算了  就陪你玩到這吧
But I think not, I think our little game ends here.

1207
02:03:32,460 --> 02:03:35,040
說吧  小偷
So tell me, thief.

1208
02:03:35,640 --> 02:03:38,020
你想怎么死
How do you choose to die?

1209
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:52,610
爸  是你嗎
Da? Is that you, Da?

1210
02:06:40,900 --> 02:06:43,270
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}橡木盾跑了

1211
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:45,290
{\pos(191.236,250.262)}撤退

1212
02:06:45,570 --> 02:06:47,070
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}橋上會合

1213
02:07:05,100 --> 02:07:06,540
都死了
You killed them all.

1214
02:07:06,540 --> 02:07:08,860
外面還有  塔睿爾
There are others, Tauriel.

1215
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:10,450
走
Come.

1216
02:07:14,680 --> 02:07:16,230
他要死了
We're losing him.

1217
02:07:19,580 --> 02:07:20,650
塔睿爾
Tauriel.

1218
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:46,070
艾瑟拉斯[王葉草]Athelas.

1219
02:07:48,590 --> 02:07:50,100
艾瑟拉斯
Athelas.

1220
02:07:51,060 --> 02:07:52,180
你要干嘛
What are you doing?

1221
02:07:55,020 --> 02:07:56,560
救他
I'm going to save him.

1222
02:08:17,740 --> 02:08:19,120
-你沒死  -活不久了
- You're alive. - Not for much longer.

1223
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:20,950
-阿肯寶鉆呢  -火龍要來了
- Did you find the Arkenstone? - The dragon's coming.

1224
02:08:20,950 --> 02:08:22,350
阿肯寶鉆
The Arkenstone.

1225
02:08:24,990 --> 02:08:26,200
找到了嗎
Did you find it?

1226
02:08:32,490 --> 02:08:33,610
快走吧
We should get out.

1227
02:08:36,940 --> 02:08:37,940
索林
Thorin.

1228
02:08:41,560 --> 02:08:42,570
索林
Thorin.

1229
02:09:13,220 --> 02:09:16,440
化為灰燼吧
You will burn!

1230
02:09:23,510 --> 02:09:25,660
-跑  -快跑  比爾博
- Come on! - Come on, Bilbo!

1231
02:09:38,540 --> 02:09:39,490
走
Come on.

1232
02:09:56,490 --> 02:09:57,560
按住他
Hold him down.

1233
02:10:14,830 --> 02:10:15,920
蒂爾達
Tilda!

1234
02:11:18,020 --> 02:11:19,540
我們甩掉它了
We have given him the slip.

1235
02:11:19,550 --> 02:11:22,920
他會追上的
No, he'll still come in for that.

1236
02:11:24,950 --> 02:11:28,260
-現在去哪  -西邊的衛隊室
- So where to now? - Western guard room.

1237
02:11:28,760 --> 02:11:31,660
-或許能出去  -太高了
- There may be a way out. - It's too high.

1238
02:11:32,130 --> 02:11:34,510
-沒可能的  -只有這條路了
- No chance that way. - It's our only chance.

1239
02:11:36,190 --> 02:11:37,370
我們得賭一把
We have to try it.

1240
02:10:05,870 --> 02:10:12,720
<i>愿星月之光眷顧你  賜你生機
Menno o nin na hon i eliad annen annin hon leitho o-ngurth.</i>

1241
02:10:16,770 --> 02:10:27,720
<i>愿星月之光眷顧你  賜你生機
Menno o nin na hon i eliad annen annin hon leitho o-ngurth.</i>

1242
02:10:28,870 --> 02:10:35,020
<i>愿星月之光眷顧你  賜你生機
Menno o nin na hon i eliad annen annin hon leitho o-ngurth.</i>

1243
02:10:35,530 --> 02:10:46,720
<i>愿星月之光眷顧你  賜你生機
Menno o nin na hon i eliad annen annin hon leitho o-ngurth.</i>

1244
02:10:47,930 --> 02:10:56,720
<i>愿星月之光眷顧你  賜你生機
Menno o nin na hon i eliad annen annin hon leitho o-ngurth.</i>

1245
02:12:42,870 --> 02:12:46,720
我只聽過精靈療傷的傳說
I've heard tales of wonders of Elvish medicine.

1246
02:12:46,860 --> 02:12:49,340
親眼見到真是榮幸
That was a privilege to witness.

1247
02:12:52,120 --> 02:12:53,320
塔睿爾
Tauriel.

1248
02:12:57,460 --> 02:12:58,590
躺好
Lie still.

1249
02:13:06,050 --> 02:13:07,910
你不是她
You cannot be her.

1250
02:13:11,540 --> 02:13:13,270
她在遠方
She's far away.

1251
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:21,400
在遙不可及的遠方
She is far, far away from me.

1252
02:13:22,780 --> 02:13:28,180
她走在天上的星光里
She walks in starlight in another world.

1253
02:13:33,190 --> 02:13:34,980
可惜只是個夢
It was just a dream.

1254
02:13:46,980 --> 02:13:49,040
你覺得她會愛上我嗎
Do you think she could have loved me?

1255
02:13:56,120 --> 02:13:57,120
跟緊
Stay close.

1256
02:14:07,860 --> 02:14:11,140
-完了  -沒路了
- That's it, then. - There's no way out.

1257
02:14:18,160 --> 02:14:19,880
最后的族人
The last of our kin.

1258
02:14:24,100 --> 02:14:29,150
絕處逢生的希望  成了泡影
They must have come here, hoping beyond hope.

1259
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,960
回礦山看看吧
We can try to reach the mines.

1260
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:44,040
在生命最后的時刻
My last few days.

1261
02:14:46,470 --> 02:14:47,550
不
No.

1262
02:14:50,620 --> 02:14:52,430
我不要這樣死去
I will not die like this.

1263
02:14:54,190 --> 02:14:57,700
畏縮不前  茍延殘喘
Cowering, clawing for breath.

1264
02:15:02,830 --> 02:15:06,440
-我們去熔爐  -會被發現的  死路一條
- We make for the forges. - He'll see us, sure as death.

1265
02:15:06,440 --> 02:15:07,900
分頭行動就不會
Not if we split up.

1266
02:15:07,900 --> 02:15:10,880
索林  我們到不了的
Thorin, we'll never make it.

1267
02:15:10,880 --> 02:15:14,880
總有人能到  引他去熔爐
Some of us might, lead him to the forges.

1268
02:15:16,020 --> 02:15:17,590
我們要屠龍
We kill the dragon.

1269
02:15:19,590 --> 02:15:24,470
就算是死路一條  也是同生共死
If this is to end in fire, then we will all burn together.

1270
02:15:26,120 --> 02:15:27,170
這邊
This way.

1271
02:15:31,880 --> 02:15:37,960
逃命  逃命去吧
Flee, flee, run for your lives.

1272
02:15:37,960 --> 02:15:42,470
雖然無處可逃了
There is nowhere to hide.

1273
02:15:42,520 --> 02:15:43,720
看后面
Behind you!

1274
02:15:45,220 --> 02:15:46,220
這邊
Come on!

1275
02:15:48,350 --> 02:15:49,320
跑
Run!

1276
02:15:50,890 --> 02:15:53,900
在這邊
Hey you! Here!

1277
02:16:26,030 --> 02:16:28,660
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}給多爾戈多送信

1278
02:16:29,030 --> 02:16:31,800
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}橡木盾到了孤山

1279
02:16:42,630 --> 02:16:43,600
{\pos(190.792,249.978)}快去

1280
02:16:44,280 --> 02:16:46,450
{\pos(188.981,249.978)}你  跟我來

1281
02:18:51,540 --> 02:18:53,670
這條路
This way, it's this way!

1282
02:18:53,670 --> 02:18:56,390
-這邊  -索林
- Come on! - Thorin!

1283
02:19:01,410 --> 02:19:02,580
跟巴林走
Follow Balin.

1284
02:19:03,910 --> 02:19:05,070
-索林  -快
- Thorin! - Come on!

1285
02:19:20,840 --> 02:19:21,850
索林
Thorin!

1286
02:19:31,520 --> 02:19:32,640
抓緊
Hold on!

1287
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:07,520
快
Come on!

1288
02:20:10,230 --> 02:20:11,470
快跑
Go, go!

1289
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:19,530
行不通  熔爐早就冷卻了
Our plan's not gonna work. These furnaces are stone-cold.

1290
02:20:19,530 --> 02:20:20,580
確實
He's right.

1291
02:20:20,580 --> 02:20:23,420
沒有大火  沒法點燃熔爐
With no fire hot enough to set them ablaze.

1292
02:20:26,030 --> 02:20:27,250
沒有嗎
Have we not?

1293
02:20:28,970 --> 02:20:31,710
沒想到贏你這么容易
I did not look to see you so easily outwitted!

1294
02:20:35,850 --> 02:20:37,450
你變慢了
You're growing slow,

1295
02:20:37,730 --> 02:20:41,430
變胖了  老不死的
and fat, you dotage,

1296
02:20:42,790 --> 02:20:44,040
糊涂蟲
slug!

1297
02:20:45,490 --> 02:20:46,570
躲起來
Take cover!

1298
02:21:14,630 --> 02:21:17,050
邦伯  拉動風箱
Bombur, get those bellows working!

1299
02:21:17,050 --> 02:21:18,040
快
Go!

1300
02:21:32,290 --> 02:21:36,180
比爾博  去操縱桿那  等我信號
Bilbo! Up there! On my mark, pull that lever.

1301
02:21:46,760 --> 02:21:49,240
巴林  能弄些炸彈嗎
Balin, can you still make us a blast flame?

1302
02:21:49,240 --> 02:21:51,830
行  一小會就弄好
Aye, it'll only take a jiffy. Come on.

1303
02:21:53,490 --> 02:21:55,060
一小會也等不及啊
We don't have a jiffy.

1304
02:22:06,870 --> 02:22:10,070
-硫磺呢  -你真的會做嗎
- Where's the sulphur? - You sure you know what are you doing?

1305
02:22:21,890 --> 02:22:22,870
速度
Come on!

1306
02:22:44,930 --> 02:22:46,260
動手
Now!

1307
02:24:42,370 --> 02:24:44,390
引它去歷代君王的畫像那
Lead him to the gallery of the kings.

1308
02:25:32,480 --> 02:25:33,840
別停下  比爾博
Keep going, Bilbo!

1309
02:26:20,490 --> 02:26:23,440
你以為你騙得了我嗎
You, think you can deceive me?

1310
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:25,410
酒桶騎士
Barrel-rider.

1311
02:26:27,250 --> 02:26:29,860
你是從長湖城來的
You have come from Lake-town.

1312
02:26:31,660 --> 02:26:37,120
這群骯臟的矮人  和運河上的生意人
It is some sort of schemes hatched between these filthy Dwarves

1313
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:39,970
悲哀的長湖城人一起密謀
and those miserable tub-trading lakeman.

1314
02:26:41,100 --> 02:26:47,920
只知道射黑箭的膽小鬼們
The sniveling cowards, with their long bows and black arrows.

1315
02:26:48,220 --> 02:26:53,920
-我是不是該會會他們  -糟糕
- Perhaps it is time I pay them a visit. - No.

1316
02:26:55,950 --> 02:27:00,540
這和他們無關  別去長湖城
This isn't their fault. Wait, you cannot go to Lake-town!

1317
02:27:02,380 --> 02:27:06,460
你在乎他們  對吧
You care about them, do you?

1318
02:27:06,920 --> 02:27:07,990
很好
Good.

1319
02:27:08,480 --> 02:27:11,330
那就看著他們化為灰燼吧
And you can watch them die.

1320
02:27:16,310 --> 02:27:20,290
我在這  笨蟲子
Here! You witless worm!

1321
02:27:26,030 --> 02:27:30,270
-你  -新帳舊賬一起算
- You. - I am taking back what you stole.

1322
02:27:34,650 --> 02:27:40,140
你斗不過我的  矮人
You will take nothing from me, Dwarf.

1323
02:27:40,840 --> 02:27:45,860
舊日的矮人勇士都倒在我腳下
I laid low your warriors of old,

1324
02:27:45,860 --> 02:27:50,450
嚇得魂不附體
eye in still terror in the hearts of men.

1325
02:27:51,560 --> 02:27:56,900
我才是山下之王
I am King Under the Mountain.

1326
02:27:57,410 --> 02:28:01,670
這王國不屬于你  這是矮人之國
This is not your kingdom, these are Dwarf lands.

1327
02:28:02,640 --> 02:28:04,630
矮人的黃金
This is Dwarf gold.

1328
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:09,610
看矮人怎么復仇吧
And we will have our revenge.

1329
02:29:30,060 --> 02:29:35,150
我會復仇的
I will revenge, revenge!

1330
02:29:35,720 --> 02:29:41,030
我要去復仇
I will show you revenge!

1331
02:30:17,240 --> 02:30:20,690
聽我說  你不知道什么來了嗎
Listen to me, you don't know what is coming?

1332
02:30:23,600 --> 02:30:27,370
我就是烈焰
I am fire.

1333
02:30:28,370 --> 02:30:30,920
我就是
I am...

1334
02:30:33,020 --> 02:30:34,280
死亡
Death.

1335
02:30:43,180 --> 02:30:44,450
我們都干了什么
What have we done?
