<i>where people were just happy.</i>

00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:18,315
<i>Right? They were happy to be</i>

508
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:46,844
and there was an older usher there.

509
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:48,846
And it was an African‐American guy.

510
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:51,849
<i>And he just started</i>
<i>asking me some questions.</i>

511
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:54,601
<i>And he was like, you know,</i>
<i>"What's the company about?</i>

512
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,228
What do you do there?"

513
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:58,313
And, you know,
I'm answering his questions.

514
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:03,026
We're going on and on, and he just
kind of changed his tone of voice

515
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:05,112
and he kind of looked down
on me a little bit

516
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:08,156
and he was like, "Brother,
can I ask you a serious question?"

517
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,450
I was like, "Yeah.
Sure, ask me the question."

AUGUST URBISH: <i>I had been</i>
<i>to a couple of the summer camps,</i>

521
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:25,966
and I saw how much fun
everybody was having

522
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:28,051
within the We community.

523
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:31,763
<i>So then a friend of mine</i>
<i>who worked for WeWork</i>

524
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:34,141
called me up and said, "Look...

525
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:35,851
"WeWork is doing this new thing.

526
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:38,270
"I can't tell you
anything about it right now.

527
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:43,525
"Um, it's going to be
for the coolest people in New York,

528
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:46,320
"and I promise you are going
to want to be a part of it.

529
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,407
Are you willing to break your lease
to do this new WeWork venture?"

530
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:53,118
Like... "Can I have a couple days?"

531
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:55,787
And she said, "No, you can't
have a couple days.

532
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:58,874
I need to know right now, are you
willing to break your lease for this?"

533
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:01,668
Uh, and I said, "I guess...

534
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:02,961
Yeah."

535
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:05,464
Reluctantly.
I said, "Yeah, I will do it."

536
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:11,011
<i>So a couple of weeks later,</i>
<i>I got this invitation</i>

537
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:15,307
<i>for what looked like</i> Eyes Wide Shut <i>,</i>
<i>that Tom Cruise movie.</i>

538

540
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:25,192
"I'll see you there," basically.
So I was like, "Jesus, okay."

541
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:29,029
So I show up and Adam Neumann
was there at this initial thing,

542
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:31,823
<i>and there was maybe</i>
<i>500 people in this room,</i>

543
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:35,202
<i>and they revealed what was going on.</i>

544
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:38,622
<i>WeWork is starting WeLive,</i>

545
00:25:38,622 --> 00:25:43,836
that is all about this new way of living.

546
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:49,049
<i>And we had a very distinct opportunity</i>
<i>to be the first people in there.</i>

547
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:54,513
I believed every word that
came out of Adam's mouth.

<i>He seemed like he was talking</i>

550
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:03,939
<i>like a man on a mission.</i>

551
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:05,357
<i>So I signed the thing</i>

552
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:08,318
and they got back to me
and asked me to write

553
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:13,323
a very sort of generic
"why you should live here."

554
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:14,616
"Why should we pick you?"

555
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:18,662
<i>Like I didn't know anything about WeLive,</i>

556
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:23,417
<i>so I was essentially writing a book report</i>
<i>for a book that I hadn't read.</i>

557
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,335
It's one of those things

558
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:27,754
all I have to say is, "Wow!"

559
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:33,218
<i>So, you know, I wrote</i>
<i>way too long of an essay than I needed to.</i>

560
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:38,223
And, uh, shortly after that,
I was... accepted.

561
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:43,729
<i>This was supposed to be a space</i>
<i>where it's move‐in ready.</i>

562
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:45,689
<i>You don't need anything.</i>

563
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:49,109
So I packed a bag, just one big bag,

564
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:52,738
like a drifter, and walked into the space.

565
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:56,408
<i>And it was...</i>

566
00:26:57,492 --> 00:26:59,411
stunning, it was beautiful.

567
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:02,247

QUINTON KERNS:
<i>I was the first designer at WeLive.</i>

569
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:08,712
<i>I moved into WeLive,</i>

570
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:11,548
<i>because I was one of the first</i>
<i>members to be a beta tester.</i>

571
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:14,676
And that meant that,
for the first six months,

572
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:17,346
there was a drastically reduced price.

573
00:27:17,346 --> 00:27:20,516
I had designed the space
with my colleagues,

574
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:22,392
and I couldn't pass up the opportunity,

575
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:24,686
<i>and it was really cool</i>
<i>because you were living</i>

576
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:26,939
<i>in this brand‐new living situation.</i>

577
00:27:28,774 --> 00:27:31,026
AUGUST: <i>The Murphy bed</i>
<i>was built into the couch.</i>

578
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:33,195
<i>There was a little desk</i>
<i>tucked into a corner</i>

579
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:35,280
<i>that you could put your computer on.</i>

580
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,617
The whole thing may
have been 200 square feet.

581
00:27:38,617 --> 00:27:41,161
Might have been 200 square feet.
Like on a good day.

582
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:44,831
<i>But it was all about community.</i>

583
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:50,838
I think the initial group of people
definitely fit a certain criteria.

584
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:55,217
<i>I mean, beyond being young</i>
<i>with no actual responsibilities.</i>

585
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:58,053
‐ A lot of single people.
Everybody was single.

586
00:27:58,053 --> 00:28:00,681
We actually had a saying that
everything had to be designed

587
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:02,099
to hold the weight of two people.

588
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:04,726
AUGUST: <i>Guess what all</i>
<i>those people had in common</i>

589
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:09,857
<i>was the ability to pause their</i>
<i>personal lives to try out this new thing.</i>

590
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:13,443
QUINTON: <i>They appealed to the same</i>
<i>WeWork generation of millennials.</i>

591
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:16,488
A lot of people worked at WeWork
who lived at WeLive at the time.

592
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:21,201
AUGUST: <i>A very, very small</i>
<i>percentage of us were outsiders,</i>

00:28:23,537 --> 00:28:29,084
<i>The first six months, it was weird</i>
<i>if someone left the building.</i>

595
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:32,462
If someone were like, "Hey, I'm going
to a friend's birthday party,"

596
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:34,715
and the very common next question is,

597
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:36,216
<i>"Oh, which floor is it on?"</i>

598
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:39,094

you get friends automatically,

<i>WeWork was the future of work.</i>

00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,397
<i>and she starts guiding a huge</i>
<i>amount of decisions at WeWork</i>

1128
00:55:55,397 --> 00:55:57,357
<i>about the way they spent their money.</i>

1129
00:55:57,357 --> 00:55:59,568
<i>Adam's and Rebekah's spiritual advisor</i>

1130
00:55:59,568 --> 00:56:02,196
<i>would speak to executives</i>
<i>on a weekly basis,</i>

1131
00:56:02,196 --> 00:56:06,825
and this constant dose of spiritualism
was due to Rebekah.

ADAM: Hello, New York.

1133
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:10,162
Hello, WeWork.

1134
00:56:10,162 --> 00:56:12,748
Hello, global citizens of this Earth.

1135
00:56:12,748 --> 00:56:15,876
<i>You know what a global citizen</i>
<i>of this Earth is?</i>

1136
00:56:15,876 --> 00:56:17,669
<i>It's a member of the We generation,</i>

1137
00:56:17,669 --> 00:56:20,255
<i>and a member of the We generation</i>
<i>does not discriminate</i>

1138
00:56:20,255 --> 00:56:23,884
<i>with age, race, gender, or religion.</i>

1139
00:56:23,884 --> 00:56:27,137
If you're a member of the We generation,
make some noise!

1140
00:56:27,137 --> 00:56:29,681
[cheering]

1141
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:31,850
‐ WeWork is also expanding

1142
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:35,771
its kind of diverse and
sometimes confusing portfolio.

1143
00:56:35,771 --> 00:56:38,815
<i>It makes a bunch of acquisitions</i>
<i>of other startups.</i>

1144
00:56:38,815 --> 00:56:40,776
ADAM:
<i>We had this idea of,</i>

1145
00:56:40,776 --> 00:56:43,111
<i>why don't we just invest money</i>
<i>in companies that make impact?</i>

1146
00:56:43,111 --> 00:56:45,531
<i>All the employees</i>
<i>will wanna work for them,</i>

1147
00:56:45,531 --> 00:56:49,117
<i>everybody wanna be part of it, and it's</i>
<i>just gonna work out in an amazing way.</i>

1148
00:56:49,117 --> 00:56:51,286
And I looked at our team
and everybody looked at each other.

1149
00:56:51,286 --> 00:56:52,913
They said, "Of course, Adam,

1150
00:56:52,913 --> 00:56:54,915
that makes a lot of sense,
but who's gonna pay for that?"

1151
00:56:54,915 --> 00:56:56,625
And we said, "Well...

1152
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:58,126
Masa might..." No.

1153
00:56:58,126 --> 00:56:59,628
We said, "Well..."

1154
00:56:59,628 --> 00:57:01,088
That was a private joke.

1155
00:57:01,088 --> 00:57:03,757
‐ I went back to meet with Adam

1156
00:57:03,757 --> 00:57:06,510
at sort of the new‐and‐improved
headquarters.

1157
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:09,012
<i>I get sort of the quick</i>
<i>version of the tour</i>

1158
00:57:09,012 --> 00:57:11,723
<i>and now WeWork has its own barista.</i>

1159
00:57:11,723 --> 00:57:15,018
<i>So I say, "Okay, I want a cappuccino,"</i>

1160
00:57:15,018 --> 00:57:17,271
<i>and Adam orders a latte.</i>

1161
00:57:17,271 --> 00:57:20,274
<i>And I reach for my coffee,</i>

1162
00:57:20,274 --> 00:57:22,943
<i>and Adam's like,</i>
<i>"Oh, no, no, that's mine."</i>

1163
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:25,779
<i>And I was like, "No... Hold on, you know.</i>

1164
00:57:25,779 --> 00:57:28,824
<i>I got the cappuccino.</i>
<i>Like that's a cappuccino."</i>

1165
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:32,619
<i>And Adam just looks really</i>
<i>confused and upset.</i>

1166
00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:36,456
And one of the staff is like,
"Oh, I'm sorry.

1167
00:57:36,456 --> 00:57:39,960
We actually call those lattes
and those cappuccinos here,"

1168
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,879
pointing at the opposite one.

1169
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:46,008
<i>It stood out to me as just like</i>
<i>a strange, gratuitous</i>

1170
00:57:46,008 --> 00:57:51,013
<i>reality‐distortion moment around Adam</i>
<i>because he was ordering lattes</i>

1171
00:57:51,013 --> 00:57:53,015
but wants cappuccinos.

1172
00:57:53,015 --> 00:57:55,559
And rather than try to explain
to him that he's wrong,

1173
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:57,603
they're just gonna change
the meaning of that word.

1174
00:57:59,521 --> 00:58:00,939
RANDALL:
<i>The money got insane.</i>

1175
00:58:00,939 --> 00:58:03,609
<i>And they shifted from this little idea...</i>

1176
00:58:03,609 --> 00:58:06,653
Then it was, "Okay, we're now
going to tell you how to live, WeLive.

1177
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:08,697
And now we're gonna redefine
how you live."

1178
00:58:08,697 --> 00:58:10,908
And that wasn't good enough. "WeGrow.

1179
00:58:10,908 --> 00:58:12,367
<i>We're gonna educate your kids better."</i>

1180
00:58:12,367 --> 00:58:14,286
‐ When my eldest daughter
was in kindergarten,

1181
00:58:14,286 --> 00:58:16,205
as we started to look around for schools

1182
00:58:16,205 --> 00:58:18,749
in both New York and the west coast,

1183
00:58:18,749 --> 00:58:23,462
I wasn't finding a place that was
gonna nurture her spirit and her soul

1184
00:58:23,462 --> 00:58:25,422
as much as her mind.

1185
00:58:25,422 --> 00:58:27,132
DON:
<i>You know, at some point</i>

1186
00:58:27,132 --> 00:58:29,676
<i>Rebekah was talking</i>
<i>to the company about WeGrow,</i>

1187
00:58:29,676 --> 00:58:32,763
<i>and she's talking in front of</i>
<i>a cross‐section of 700 employees,</i>

1188
00:58:32,763 --> 00:58:34,598
<i>and is basically saying that,</i>

1189
00:58:34,598 --> 00:58:37,559
<i>New York City private schools</i>
<i>aren't good enough for our children.</i>

1190
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:41,522
<i>And then meanwhile,</i>
<i>you're gonna start a school that has</i>

1191
00:58:41,522 --> 00:58:46,568
<i>like a 35, 40 grand tuition fee</i>
<i>per elementary school kid.</i>

1192
00:58:46,568 --> 00:58:49,071
That school is exclusionary
to a lot of people, right?

1193
00:58:49,071 --> 00:58:54,868
<i>That's just a prototypical person</i>
<i>who's grown up in certain circles</i>

1194
00:58:54,868 --> 00:58:57,538
<i>and doesn't realize there's</i>
<i>other people in the world.</i>

1195
00:58:57,538 --> 00:59:01,792
RANDALL:
<i>The idea that you're gonna reinvent work</i>

1196
00:59:01,792 --> 00:59:04,586
is incredibly audacious unto itself.

1197
00:59:04,586 --> 00:59:08,257
To say, "While we're doing that,
we're also gonna reinvent education..."

1198
00:59:08,257 --> 00:59:11,093
which people have been trying
to do for centuries,

1199
00:59:11,093 --> 00:59:15,013
<i>that's the kind of decision tree</i>
<i>that you see in a company</i>

1200
00:59:15,013 --> 00:59:18,392
where you start to believe your own BS.

1201
00:59:18,392 --> 00:59:21,061
HOST: <i>All right, welcome, everyone,</i>
<i>to The School of Greatness podcast.</i>

1202
00:59:21,061 --> 00:59:23,230
We've got Rebekah Neumann in the house.

1203
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:25,566
‐ Thanks for having me.
‐ Yeah, this is fun.

1204
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:28,861
What is the mission of WeGrow,
just so I understand clearly?

1205
00:59:28,861 --> 00:59:32,155
‐ The mission of WeGrow,
and quite honestly the collective "we"

1206
00:59:32,155 --> 00:59:33,365
that we're all living under,

1207
00:59:33,365 --> 00:59:35,284
is to elevate the world's consciousness.

1208
00:59:35,284 --> 00:59:38,537
HOST: Hmm.
‐ At WeGrow, specifically,

1209
00:59:38,537 --> 00:59:41,081
through unleashing
every human's superpowers

1210
00:59:41,081 --> 00:59:43,417
and expanding happiness.

1211
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:45,002
‐ Okay, and it's...

1212
00:59:45,002 --> 00:59:47,045
And WeGrow is starting as a school?
‐ Yes.

1213
00:59:47,045 --> 00:59:50,090
‐ But it's going to be evolving into
much more, I'm assuming, right?

1214
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:52,509
‐ It's kind of a practice
and a new approach to life.

1215
00:59:52,509 --> 00:59:55,345
We have started with children,
but we're...

1216
00:59:55,345 --> 00:59:58,307
as soon as next week starting
to pilot some of the curriculum

1217
00:59:58,307 --> 01:00:00,309
on our WeGrownups.

1218
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:01,935
‐ Really?
‐ Uh‐huh.

1219
01:00:01,935 --> 01:00:03,604
‐ Is that what you call us?
‐ Just for the moment.

1220
01:00:03,604 --> 01:00:05,105
‐ For fun, yeah.
‐ Yeah, why not?

1221
01:00:08,483 --> 01:00:10,235
AUGUST:
<i>I was working in WeWork</i>

1222
01:00:10,235 --> 01:00:13,197
<i>and living in WeLive.</i>

1223
01:00:13,197 --> 01:00:16,533
<i>My entire life...</i>

1224
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:19,953
was being propped up by the We community.

1225
01:00:19,953 --> 01:00:24,041
<i>Every time a friend outside</i>
<i>of the We community would come over,</i>

1226
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:26,627
<i>they would only come over that one time.</i>

1227
01:00:26,627 --> 01:00:30,756
Because they would walk out with
this strange impression of what it is.

1228
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:37,221
<i>And pretty quickly I had</i>

1229
01:00:37,221 --> 01:00:40,682
<i>alienated most of my friends</i>
<i>outside of the building.</i>

1230
01:00:42,226 --> 01:00:44,353
‐ When Adam had an investor
coming through,

1231
01:00:44,353 --> 01:00:46,730
we would know ahead of time
or 10 minutes before,

1232
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:48,941
and we were being told,
"Go into the space.

1233
01:00:48,941 --> 01:00:51,151
Just hang out, be casual.
Bring your laptop."

1234
01:00:51,151 --> 01:00:53,529
<i>And we would go there</i>
<i>and activate the space.</i>

1235
01:00:53,529 --> 01:00:55,906
AUGUST: <i>They were like,</i>
<i>"Everybody should come,"</i>

1236
01:00:55,906 --> 01:00:58,992
<i>just so there's pockets of folks that are</i>

1237
01:00:58,992 --> 01:01:03,080
living the WeLive life so Adam
can come and sort of show it off.

1238
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,623
♪ "Juicy" by Notorious B. I. G. playing ♪

1240
01:01:07,709 --> 01:01:10,462

<i>"Juicy" by Biggie Smalls,</i>

1241
01:01:10,462 --> 01:01:13,006
<i>and they'd be playing a loop</i>
<i>over and over again,</i>

1242
01:01:13,006 --> 01:01:15,759
waiting for that one moment
when the investor came

1243
01:01:15,759 --> 01:01:18,387
so that when they
walked the space, we were there

1244
01:01:18,387 --> 01:01:20,681
<i>just to fill it up and make it look good.</i>

1245
01:01:20,681 --> 01:01:22,975
AUGUST:
<i>Adam showed up with this investor</i>

1246
01:01:22,975 --> 01:01:27,020
<i>and with every drink, he had another</i>
<i>vision of what WeWork could be,</i>

1247
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:31,275
like the We community could be,
what it was growing into.

1248
01:01:31,275 --> 01:01:32,985
And...

1249
01:01:32,985 --> 01:01:37,489
at a certain point, you're like,
"Dude, just shut the fuck up, man.

1250
01:01:37,489 --> 01:01:39,449
"Like, we are just having a good time.

01:01:39,449 --> 01:01:41,827
"Can we just... can we just hang out

1252
01:01:41,827 --> 01:01:45,539

and just talk about anything else?"

1253
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:48,500
<i>It got really draining</i>
<i>and really exhausting,</i>

1254
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,587
<i>to constantly...</i>

01:01:51,587 --> 01:01:54,506
<i>be a part of... this...</i>

1256
01:01:55,924 --> 01:01:57,092
thing.

1257
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:00,929
DEREK:
<i>The initial clients of WeWork</i>

1258
01:02:00,929 --> 01:02:03,390
<i>thought that they were members.</i>

1259
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:05,475
<i>But they were actually a resource</i>

1260
01:02:05,475 --> 01:02:09,563
<i>from which WeWork</i>
<i>could extract a reputation</i>

1261
01:02:09,563 --> 01:02:12,941
and then they could sort of
slingshot that reputation

1262
01:02:12,941 --> 01:02:15,485
<i>to get big corporations to think,</i>

1263
01:02:15,485 --> 01:02:18,739
<i>"We need to ask WeWork</i>

1264
01:02:18,739 --> 01:02:21,909
<i>"how to attract the best and brightest</i>

1265
01:02:21,909 --> 01:02:24,536
<i>of this up‐and‐coming generation."</i>

1266
01:02:25,996 --> 01:02:29,249
MEGAN: <i>I eventually, I was</i>
<i>promoted to operations manager,</i>

1267
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:32,961
<i>and so I was getting</i>
<i>a little more distant from Adam.</i>

1268
01:02:32,961 --> 01:02:37,508
<i>His excitement</i>
<i>isn't so close to me that I...</i>

1269
01:02:37,508 --> 01:02:41,345
<i>am breathing it in</i>
<i>and, like, intoxicated by it.</i>

1270
01:02:41,345 --> 01:02:47,059
<i>And I'm able to start seeing more clearly</i>
<i>that he was manipulative.</i>

1271
01:02:47,059 --> 01:02:50,103
He had ways of using psychology

1272
01:02:50,103 --> 01:02:54,066
<i>to maneuver through people's flaws</i>

1273
01:02:54,066 --> 01:02:56,485
<i>and to use that to his benefit.</i>

1274
01:02:57,903 --> 01:02:59,988
<i>Adam was giving me a review.</i>

1275
01:02:59,988 --> 01:03:02,491
<i>We were in one of</i>
<i>the glass conference rooms.</i>

1276
01:03:02,491 --> 01:03:05,953
<i>He was telling me I was doing a great job.</i>

1277
01:03:05,953 --> 01:03:08,956
And then another employee walked by

1278
01:03:08,956 --> 01:03:13,126
who was very peppy and very pretty,

1279
01:03:13,126 --> 01:03:16,088
<i>and he said, "But you're not her."</i>

1280
01:03:16,088 --> 01:03:18,507
And he pointed out her and said,
"You could be,

1281
01:03:18,507 --> 01:03:21,009
but you don't have
the confidence that she has."

1282
01:03:22,761 --> 01:03:25,514
I went home and thought,
"What do I need to do

1283
01:03:25,514 --> 01:03:27,975
to become a better employee here
and become like her?"

1284
01:03:30,185 --> 01:03:35,440
<i>You're constantly in this fear of,</i>
<i>"somebody else is gonna take my job.</i>

1285
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,401
I have to fight to stay here."

1286
01:03:37,401 --> 01:03:40,612
Like, I felt constantly like
I couldn't just breathe.

1287
01:03:42,322 --> 01:03:46,952
Adam would state, "I could fire all of you
and do this by myself."

1288
01:03:48,078 --> 01:03:53,250
<i>That's a bold statement to say to people</i>
<i>who are working their ass off for you.</i>

1289
01:03:55,919 --> 01:03:57,254
‐ Good morning.
‐ <i>Shalom</i>.

1290
01:03:57,254 --> 01:03:58,922
‐ <i>Shalom</i>. Um...

1291
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:00,424
I'm sure that there are lots
of people here

1292
01:04:00,424 --> 01:04:02,843
who know what WeWork is,
who maybe have worked

1293
01:04:02,843 --> 01:04:05,804
in one or several WeWorks...

1294
01:04:05,804 --> 01:04:10,184
DEREK: <i>So I met Adam in Washington, D.C.</i>
<i>for an event.</i>

1295
01:04:10,184 --> 01:04:12,519
My friends who worked
at WeWork told me about him.

1296
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:16,440
And they just said this was

1297
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,859
one of the most charismatic...

1298
01:04:18,859 --> 01:04:20,903
one of the most visionary

1299
01:04:20,903 --> 01:04:24,698
and ingenious leaders

1300
01:04:24,698 --> 01:04:27,618
of any tech company in the world.

1301
01:04:27,618 --> 01:04:30,829
<i>He just sounded like a mythical figure.</i>

1302
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:33,415
<i>And I was just really curious, like,</i>

1303
01:04:33,415 --> 01:04:38,212
what does he understand about leasing
real estate and subdividing it?

1304
01:04:38,212 --> 01:04:39,588
<i>Like, we're talking about</i>

1305
01:04:39,588 --> 01:04:43,342
<i>one of the most boring</i>
<i>business models in the world,</i>

1306
01:04:43,342 --> 01:04:45,260
and I was really curious
to know what was behind it.

1307
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:47,846
It's fascinating to me
about WeWork because

1308
01:04:47,846 --> 01:04:49,389
lots of people here who have been there,

1309
01:04:49,389 --> 01:04:52,226
they've seen how lovely
the interior decoration is.

1310
01:04:52,226 --> 01:04:56,063
But there are lots of companies
that make beautiful spaces.

1311
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:59,358
Um, but they're not worth $20 billion,

1312
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:01,902
which is WeWork's most recent valuation.

1313
01:05:01,902 --> 01:05:05,906
So I wonder what do you consider
to be your special sauce?

1314
01:05:05,906 --> 01:05:08,492
‐ So, first of all, excellent question.

1315
01:05:08,492 --> 01:05:12,287
From the first day that we started WeWork,
it was about bringing people together.

1316
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:14,748
As our mission, and our mission always...

1317
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:17,334
‐ And his answer was everything
that we've heard in the last few years,

1318
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:19,336
it's that they were doing
something special with the culture,

1319
01:05:19,336 --> 01:05:22,965
that their special sauce
couldn't be found in earnings

1320
01:05:22,965 --> 01:05:24,883
or cash flow or revenue.

1321
01:05:24,883 --> 01:05:27,511
It was a... a spirit of We

1322
01:05:27,511 --> 01:05:29,596
that was the truly distinguishing part
of this company.

1323
01:05:29,596 --> 01:05:31,765
‐ And the one thing, you say,
"Are you a co‐working space?"

1324
01:05:31,765 --> 01:05:34,935
We're as much a co‐working space as Amazon
is a book‐selling store.

1325
01:05:34,935 --> 01:05:37,563
Anybody who thought that Amazon
was there just to sell books

1326
01:05:37,563 --> 01:05:40,399
just didn't understand the vision,
and you just need to look now and see

1327
01:05:40,399 --> 01:05:42,025
how much greater the vision is.

1328
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:44,987
DEREK: <i>You know,</i>
<i>I wish I'd pressed him harder on it.</i>

1329
01:05:44,987 --> 01:05:46,780
<i>But I didn't because</i>

1330
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:50,617
<i>I had no idea</i>
<i>what the company actually was.</i>

1331
01:05:50,617 --> 01:05:52,786
And I think in the case of Adam Neumann,

1332
01:05:52,786 --> 01:05:57,541
there were a lot of people
who were impressed by his live charisma,

1333
01:05:57,541 --> 01:06:02,254
<i>who privately harbored doubts</i>
<i>about exactly how all of this worked.</i>

1334
01:06:02,254 --> 01:06:05,007
I was one of them, I suppose, you know?

1335
01:06:05,007 --> 01:06:06,925
I didn't say in that interview,

1336
01:06:06,925 --> 01:06:10,554
"I think that this company is just,
you know, a lot of smoke and mirrors."

1337
01:06:10,554 --> 01:06:12,181
I didn't, I didn't know for sure.

1338
01:06:12,181 --> 01:06:15,184
I just privately harbored
this doubt that said that

1339
01:06:15,184 --> 01:06:17,352
this was all kind of a magic show.

1340
01:06:17,352 --> 01:06:19,938
‐ So our first mission was,
create the world where people make a life.

1341
01:06:19,938 --> 01:06:23,400
That was for WeWork. WeLive
is helping you live and not just exist.

1342
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,235
And now we have a WeOS,

1343
01:06:25,235 --> 01:06:27,779
which is our operating system
for physical spaces.

1344
01:06:27,779 --> 01:06:30,699
And it's growing very fast
and it's everything from your entry system

1345
01:06:30,699 --> 01:06:33,202
when you enter the building,
but then how do you book a conference room

1346
01:06:33,202 --> 01:06:35,704
and how do you attend an event
and who's signed in the building...?

1347
01:06:35,704 --> 01:06:39,917
STEVE: <i>Real estate usually is a very</i>
<i>dependable, predictable business.</i>

1348
01:06:39,917 --> 01:06:41,960
It doesn't grow that much,
but it's steady.

1349
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,754
You can kind of map out these returns.

1350
01:06:43,754 --> 01:06:48,217
<i>But WeWork was growing</i>
<i>so fast that it was being valued</i>

1351
01:06:48,217 --> 01:06:52,429
by investors as an ultrafast growth,

1352
01:06:52,429 --> 01:06:54,723
low‐overhead technology company.

1353
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:59,269
LISA: <i>They created this sort of</i>
<i>Facebook‐type platform for members</i>

1354
01:06:59,269 --> 01:07:02,564
<i>where you could get people</i>
<i>connected through technology.</i>

1355
01:07:02,564 --> 01:07:05,734
DON: <i>WeWork has what's like</i>
<i>its internal LinkedIn, I call it, right?</i>

1356
01:07:05,734 --> 01:07:07,402
<i>It's called the WeWork Member Network.</i>

1357
01:07:07,402 --> 01:07:09,112
You know, you have your profile page.

1358
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:11,031
‐ Adam was often saying,

1359
01:07:11,031 --> 01:07:13,575
"Oh, and people are posting
job opportunities

1360
01:07:13,575 --> 01:07:16,161
and connecting with each other
on the platform."

1361
01:07:16,161 --> 01:07:19,665
ALEX: <i>They had acquired a bunch</i>
<i>of interesting technologies</i>

1362
01:07:19,665 --> 01:07:22,292
<i>and were stitching together</i>
<i>what might have been by far</i>

1363
01:07:22,292 --> 01:07:25,963
<i>the most comprehensive tool</i>
<i>for how people work.</i>

1364
01:07:25,963 --> 01:07:29,258
ADAM: We use beacon technology
but a lot of other aspects.

1365
01:07:29,258 --> 01:07:32,135
We're using our video cameras to actually
see where interactions are happening.

1366
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:36,181
And our entire process is built to make
our members more successful.

1367
01:07:36,181 --> 01:07:38,392
ALEX:
<i>The cynical read, of course, is,</i>

1368
01:07:38,392 --> 01:07:42,729
<i>well, those intentions are all great,</i>
<i>but what you still do is office space</i>

1369
01:07:42,729 --> 01:07:44,857
and you are a real estate company.

1370
01:07:44,857 --> 01:07:48,652
But I think that, you know,
when companies are private,

1371
01:07:48,652 --> 01:07:51,530
<i>it's hard for us to know what's</i>
<i>happening behind the scenes.</i>

1372
01:07:54,658 --> 01:07:57,744
‐ My business is called
Thinknum Alternative Data.

1373
01:07:57,744 --> 01:08:02,791
<i>And we index and crawl</i>
<i>public information from the Web.</i>

1374
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:07,880
Our bots just happened to add WeWork
into our list of companies,

1375
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:12,843
<i>and then our bots found something</i>
<i>astonishing about WeWork.</i>

1376
01:08:12,843 --> 01:08:17,848
WeWork painted themselves as this company
that was growing extremely fast,

1377
01:08:17,848 --> 01:08:22,144
and once people joined
they don't really leave.

1378
01:08:22,144 --> 01:08:25,480
<i>But using data on the public Web,</i>

1379
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:27,858
<i>we actually plotted the churn rate,</i>

1380
01:08:27,858 --> 01:08:31,445
<i>which is how many people join</i>
<i>and then leave.</i>

1381
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:34,823
And we did see that
the churn rate had increased

1382
01:08:34,823 --> 01:08:36,950
and this was accelerating.

1383
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:39,494
<i>The other trend we found was</i>

1384
01:08:39,494 --> 01:08:42,414
<i>no one ever used</i>
<i>their internal social network.</i>

1385
01:08:43,498 --> 01:08:46,460
<i>When you call yourselves</i>
<i>a technology company,</i>

1386
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:50,881
and when you actually build
a social network to help
further paint that picture,

1387
01:08:50,881 --> 01:08:54,551
if no one uses it, then you're
not a technology company.

1388
01:08:54,551 --> 01:08:56,053
[keying on keyboard]

1389
01:08:56,053 --> 01:08:58,680
<i>Our next instinct was,</i>
<i>let's write a blog post</i>

1390
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:00,474
<i>and, you know, just share our findings.</i>

1391
01:09:00,474 --> 01:09:02,643
<i>It really started taking off there.</i>

1392
01:09:02,643 --> 01:09:07,314
<i>Then, about three hours later,</i>
<i>WeWork sent us an email</i>

1393
01:09:07,314 --> 01:09:11,193
<i>asking if we could</i>
<i>take down the blog post.</i>

1394
01:09:11,193 --> 01:09:14,404
<i>Our first instinct was to just ignore it.</i>

1395
01:09:14,404 --> 01:09:20,035
And then the community manager
stopped by to our office.

1396
01:09:20,035 --> 01:09:21,787
<i>And she says,</i>

1397
01:09:21,787 --> 01:09:25,874
"You've violated our membership
happiness clause,"

1398
01:09:25,874 --> 01:09:29,837
and the kicker was, she said,
"You have 30 minutes to leave." [laughs]

1399
01:09:29,837 --> 01:09:34,049
<i>In the wake of our blog post</i>
<i>and publication,</i>

1400
01:09:34,049 --> 01:09:36,260
WeWork kept raising more money.

1401
01:09:40,472 --> 01:09:44,518
SCOTT: <i>I first read about WeWork</i>
<i>when they raised money on SoftBank,</i>

1402
01:09:44,518 --> 01:09:47,396
<i>at a $20 billion valuation.</i>

1403
01:09:47,396 --> 01:09:50,607
And at that point they had
about 200 locations.

1404
01:09:50,607 --> 01:09:53,110
I went through and looked at the buildings

1405
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:55,404
that they actually had
their facilities in.

1406
01:09:55,404 --> 01:09:58,282
<i>And I determined at that valuation</i>

1407
01:09:58,282 --> 01:10:01,827
<i>that the 200 buildings</i>
<i>were each worth less</i>

1408
01:10:01,827 --> 01:10:05,122
<i>than that WeWork office</i>
<i>was being valued at.</i>

1409
01:10:06,748 --> 01:10:10,836
And I said that WeWork was the most
overvalued private company in the world.

1410
01:10:12,921 --> 01:10:18,260
ALEX: <i>Adam Neumann told us</i>
<i>repeatedly that WeWork was profitable.</i>

1411
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:20,429
<i>We've since found out</i>

1412
01:10:20,429 --> 01:10:24,433
that how Neumann and WeWork
were considering themselves profitable

1413
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:26,685
was a stretch at best.

1414
01:10:27,436 --> 01:10:29,062
WOMAN:
<i>Are you profitable?</i>

1415
01:10:29,062 --> 01:10:31,064
ADAM:
<i>So we are... as per choice.</i>

1416
01:10:31,064 --> 01:10:33,984
Because when you have a 40% business,
when you have a margin,

1417
01:10:33,984 --> 01:10:36,695
you can actually choose
when to be profitable.
WOMAN: Right.

1418
01:10:36,695 --> 01:10:40,449
‐ We like to hover around
an EBITDA, a break even,

1419
01:10:40,449 --> 01:10:42,868
and then we can choose when we wanna move,
where we wanna move.

1420
01:10:42,868 --> 01:10:45,579
Right now we're in
a very high‐growth stage of our business,

1421
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:49,082
and we don't see that
stopping anytime soon.

1422
01:10:49,082 --> 01:10:50,417
‐ So EBITDA‐‐

1423
01:10:50,417 --> 01:10:53,128
<i>earnings before interest, tax,</i>
<i>depreciation and amortization‐‐</i>

1424
01:10:53,128 --> 01:10:57,925
<i>is sort of this accepted metric</i>
<i>for how profitable a company might be.</i>

1425
01:10:57,925 --> 01:11:01,512
<i>But WeWork started inventing</i>
<i>their own financial metrics</i>

1426
01:11:01,512 --> 01:11:04,348
to enter into this
consensual hallucination,

1427
01:11:04,348 --> 01:11:08,227
<i>and they used this term</i>
<i>"community adjusted EBITDA."</i>

1428
01:11:08,227 --> 01:11:09,937
<i>Basically it was an attempt to say,</i>

1429
01:11:09,937 --> 01:11:14,358
"we want to pretend to be
profitable by ignoring these expenses."

1430
01:11:14,358 --> 01:11:16,443
MAUREEN:
<i>They adjusted for things</i>

1431
01:11:16,443 --> 01:11:20,322
<i>that were ridiculous to strip out</i>
<i>and say you're profitable.</i>

1432
01:11:20,322 --> 01:11:23,742
So suddenly they went
from a loss‐making company

1433
01:11:23,742 --> 01:11:25,953
to a profitable company,

1434
01:11:25,953 --> 01:11:30,082
<i>just by financial engineering</i>
<i>and gimmickry.</i>

1435
01:11:30,082 --> 01:11:34,878
<i>Every year WeWork would project profits,</i>

1436
01:11:34,878 --> 01:11:37,256
<i>would fail to make any profits</i>

1437
01:11:37,256 --> 01:11:40,676
and actually their losses
would get larger and larger.

1438
01:11:40,676 --> 01:11:46,265
<i>Yet investors in the private markets</i>
<i>kept on bidding up the price of WeWork.</i>

1439
01:11:46,265 --> 01:11:48,392
<i>It kept on getting</i>
<i>higher and higher and higher.</i>

1440
01:11:48,392 --> 01:11:51,562
It's sort of mind‐boggling
that that happened.

1441
01:11:51,562 --> 01:11:55,732
And I mean that more than anything else
speaks to the gifts of Adam Neumann.

1442
01:11:55,732 --> 01:11:59,653
‐ It is my honor and pleasure
to introduce to you right now

1443
01:11:59,653 --> 01:12:02,239
our co‐founders, Miguel McKelvey

1447

<i>But I saw the change in Adam.</i>

1448
01:12:17,629 --> 01:12:20,007
<i>I think it was money blindness.</i>

1449
01:12:20,841 --> 01:12:24,761
There's so much money behind us
that nothing can happen, right?

1450
01:12:24,761 --> 01:12:27,181
We'd become untouchable, in a sense.

1451
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:28,765
[audience applauding]

1452
01:12:28,765 --> 01:12:31,268
<i>It started to feel like it was</i>
<i>more just about the business</i>

1453
01:12:31,268 --> 01:12:36,523
<i>and not about this community</i>
<i>that I grew to love over those many years.</i>

1454
01:12:37,316 --> 01:12:41,320
I think that's where I started to lose
my creative juices for the company.

1455
01:12:42,321 --> 01:12:45,032
QUINTON:
<i>After my first summer camp,</i>

1456
01:12:45,032 --> 01:12:46,992
<i>I tried to get out</i>
<i>of entering the second year.</i>

1457
01:12:46,992 --> 01:12:51,371
<i>I sat down with one of the executives</i>
<i>and explained to her that,</i>

1458
01:12:51,371 --> 01:12:53,624
"Last year I went, I didn't enjoy myself.

1459
01:12:53,624 --> 01:12:57,586
It's not for everybody,
and please don't make me go again."

1460
01:12:57,586 --> 01:13:01,048
And she kindly said, "I see your point,

1461
01:13:01,048 --> 01:13:05,594
<i>but it's a mandatory event,</i>
<i>as most company outings are."</i>

1462
01:13:05,594 --> 01:13:09,765

the really big thing in

1463
01:13:09,765 --> 01:13:11,934
the mission of what we're doing.

1464
01:13:11,934 --> 01:13:15,896
So let's just close our eyes
for one second.

1465
01:13:15,896 --> 01:13:18,982
Close eyes, hold hands.

1466
01:13:18,982 --> 01:13:22,277

1467

<i>almost eight hours a day</i>

1468
01:13:24,947 --> 01:13:26,823
<i>for maybe two or three days.</i>

1469
01:13:27,741 --> 01:13:32,204
<i>And to make sure that people</i>
<i>were actually attending...</i>

1470
01:13:32,204 --> 01:13:34,122
we had tracking bracelets on.

1471
01:13:34,122 --> 01:13:37,376
REBEKAH:
Just think about a reality in which

1472
01:13:37,376 --> 01:13:41,547
the energy that we're feeling
right now with one another

1473
01:13:41,547 --> 01:13:45,968
is an energy of unity,
an energy where I am you and you are me

1474
01:13:45,968 --> 01:13:48,178
and we all are we.

1475
01:13:48,178 --> 01:13:50,305
QUINTON:
<i>They would address the crowd,</i>

1476
01:13:50,305 --> 01:13:54,393
<i>uh, talking about whatever</i>
<i>word of the day that was...</i>

1477
01:13:54,393 --> 01:13:56,144
<i>like "authenticity."</i>

1478
01:13:56,144 --> 01:13:58,188
And as we're sitting in the mud,
I'm thinking,

1479
01:13:58,188 --> 01:14:01,483
"Well, you forced me to come
to this summer camp and sit in the mud.

1480
01:14:01,483 --> 01:14:03,986
Nothing about this to me seems authentic."

1481
01:14:03,986 --> 01:14:06,363
ADAM:
If we do the work right and we find a way

1482
01:14:06,363 --> 01:14:09,533
to become a real family
in this community and company,

1483
01:14:09,533 --> 01:14:11,410
we could wake up one day and say,

1484
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:14,496
"We want to solve the problem of children
without parents in this world."

1485
01:14:14,496 --> 01:14:17,332
We can win‐‐ and do it.
REBEKAH: And children who are
in abusive situations.

1486
01:14:17,332 --> 01:14:19,168
ADAM: And then children
in abusive situations.

1487
01:14:19,168 --> 01:14:21,587
And from that we can go to world hunger,

1488
01:14:21,587 --> 01:14:24,423
and there's so many topics
that we could take one by one,

1489
01:14:24,423 --> 01:14:28,635
and we will be able to tackle
anything that we set our minds to.

1490
01:14:30,512 --> 01:14:32,764
MAUREEN: <i>He would talk about being</i>
<i>president of the world.</i>

1491
01:14:32,764 --> 01:14:35,142
<i>He would say things like that</i>
<i>and people would say,</i>

1492
01:14:35,142 --> 01:14:36,768
<i>"Eh, is he serious?"</i>

1493
01:14:36,768 --> 01:14:39,104

1494

1495

the past and where we came from.

1496
01:14:49,823 --> 01:14:52,034
We're not here by mistake.

1497
01:14:52,034 --> 01:14:55,078
This was thought about
and planned 10 years ago.

1498
01:14:55,078 --> 01:14:57,789
And the funniest thing about it,
from the day we moved to Brooklyn,

1499
01:14:57,789 --> 01:15:00,876
Miguel and I were meeting regularly,
just like that picture,

1500
01:15:00,876 --> 01:15:02,836
planning for the future.

1501
01:15:02,836 --> 01:15:05,172
We knew that...

1502
01:15:06,048 --> 01:15:08,550
whatever it is we're looking for

1503
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:10,636
must be greater than ourselves.

1504
01:15:10,636 --> 01:15:15,307
Moving forward the "We" company.

1505
01:15:17,601 --> 01:15:20,479
ALEX: <i>SoftBank had bet</i>
<i>on Adam as an entrepreneur.</i>

1506
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:23,690
<i>They knew that the valuation was high.</i>

1507
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:26,568
But they thought that, you know,
a winner‐take‐all in this market,

1508
01:15:26,568 --> 01:15:28,529
like they had seen in other markets,

1509
01:15:28,529 --> 01:15:31,490
would be so big that they could,
you know, tolerate

1510
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:33,075
that, that valuation.

1511
01:15:33,075 --> 01:15:36,954
<i>But when there's sort of</i>
<i>a critical mass of doubt</i>

1512
01:15:36,954 --> 01:15:39,289
<i>coming back to SoftBank,</i>

1513
01:15:39,289 --> 01:15:41,625
<i>what are the sovereign wealth funds,</i>

1514
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:44,461
who are the biggest investors
in SoftBank's Vision Fund,

1515
01:15:44,461 --> 01:15:45,671
what are they saying?

1516
01:15:47,589 --> 01:15:49,800
RANDALL:
<i>When you're raising $100 billion,</i>

1517
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,885
<i>you're going to the biggest</i>
<i>deep‐pocket sources,</i>

1518
01:15:51,885 --> 01:15:54,179
so, of course, where does Masa go

1519
01:15:54,179 --> 01:15:57,099
but he goes to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia

1520
01:15:57,099 --> 01:15:59,685
<i>and they became his biggest backers.</i>

1521
01:15:59,685 --> 01:16:04,648
‐ The Saudis put dumb money
into Masa Son's Vision Fund,

1522
01:16:04,648 --> 01:16:07,484
<i>because he says,</i>
<i>"I'll get you in on the ground floor</i>

1523
01:16:07,484 --> 01:16:10,028
<i>"of the next generation</i>
<i>of great tech companies</i>

1526
01:16:16,243 --> 01:16:18,579
RANDALL:
<i>They wanna get out of the oil business</i>

1527
01:16:18,579 --> 01:16:21,206
<i>and get into as many other</i>
<i>businesses as possible.</i>

1528
01:16:21,206 --> 01:16:23,750
<i>Because they're sitting</i>
<i>on a dwindling asset.</i>

1529
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:27,880
And so what better business
to diversify than technology

1530
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:31,592
and what better way than with the most
renowned tech investor in the world

1531
01:16:31,592 --> 01:16:34,928
<i>who wants to play on the scale</i>
<i>that you can play on?</i>

1532
01:16:34,928 --> 01:16:39,266

can't really get in on the ground floor

<i>It's way too late.</i>

1535
01:16:43,604 --> 01:16:46,815
<i>So you have Masa Son</i>

1536
01:16:46,815 --> 01:16:51,486
he's telling the world are tech companies
but aren't real tech companies.

1537
01:16:51,486 --> 01:16:54,615
RANDALL: <i>And that's a lot of</i>
<i>pressure to put on a team,</i>

1538
01:16:54,615 --> 01:16:58,410
to say, "Pretty soon this company
better be worth $100 billion,"

1539
01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:01,830

01:20:23,115 --> 01:20:25,450
I've been watching the press
around this last fundraise

1604
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:27,077
and I actually think it's hilarious

1605
01:20:27,077 --> 01:20:29,788
because for some reason
there was an expectation

1606
01:20:29,788 --> 01:20:33,667
that there was gonna be
like a $20 billion or $16 billion raise.

1607
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:36,044
It's a $6 billion raise.

1608
01:20:36,044 --> 01:20:40,048
It's the second largest
venture capital investment of all time.

1609
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:43,302
I'm an investor in Uber
so I know what the first largest one was.

1610
01:20:43,302 --> 01:20:45,095
It's the second largest of all time.

1611
01:20:45,095 --> 01:20:47,055
It's SoftBank coming into this company.

1612
01:20:47,055 --> 01:20:49,516
Now they have $10 billion
invested in this company.

1613
01:20:49,516 --> 01:20:51,643
So the notion that anybody is projecting

1614
01:20:51,643 --> 01:20:53,937
that they don't have confidence
in the company I think is crazy.

1615
01:20:53,937 --> 01:20:55,397
I have confidence in the company.

1616
01:20:55,397 --> 01:20:58,400
‐ First of all, thank you,
Ashton, it's amazing.

1617
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,152
ELIOT BROWN:
<i>After the collapse of the deal,</i>

1618
01:21:00,152 --> 01:21:03,822
<i>they're out there trying</i>
<i>to put this really good face on.</i>

1619
01:21:03,822 --> 01:21:06,575
He brings along Ashton Kutcher
as this pump‐up guy.

1620
01:21:06,575 --> 01:21:09,953
<i>And it was really disingenuous.</i>

1621
01:21:09,953 --> 01:21:13,332
‐ It's above and beyond what we need
to fund the company for the next...

1622
01:21:13,332 --> 01:21:14,833
HOST: Okay.
‐ ...four to five years.

1623
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:18,587
ELIOT: <i>Adam was saying things</i>
<i>that were completely false.</i>

1624
01:21:18,587 --> 01:21:21,590
WeWork was currently a bonfire of cash

1625
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:24,676
and was gonna run out of money
by the end of the year.

1626
01:21:24,676 --> 01:21:26,762
‐ The interesting thing
about the investment,

1627
01:21:26,762 --> 01:21:28,847
there's a lot of rumors
and there's what happened.

1628
01:21:28,847 --> 01:21:31,475
The most important thing is,
when Masa called me and said,

1629
01:21:31,475 --> 01:21:33,143
"You know, this has happened
and that happened

1630
01:21:33,143 --> 01:21:34,520
and the world is changing,"

1631
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:37,648
the first thing he said is, "I'm calling
you to share this as a partner.

1632
01:21:37,648 --> 01:21:39,775
And I just wanted to come up
with a solution together."

1633
01:21:39,775 --> 01:21:41,985
‐ Because that deal didn't happen,
does that change your thoughts

1634
01:21:41,985 --> 01:21:43,737
on an IPO timeline?

1635
01:21:43,737 --> 01:21:46,031
‐ Just so we‐‐ we keep saying
"did not happen," just so we're clear.

1636
01:21:46,031 --> 01:21:47,241
We never signed the deal.

1637
01:21:47,241 --> 01:21:49,034
It's not that we signed
the deal and something happened.

1638
01:21:49,034 --> 01:21:51,828
We were trying to figure out
the best way to do it.

1639
01:21:51,828 --> 01:21:54,998
But, no, regarding an IPO,
it's always been an option.

1640
01:21:54,998 --> 01:21:57,417
We are ready for an IPO.

1641
01:21:57,417 --> 01:22:01,421
‐ You are ready?
‐ WeWork is always ready for an IPO.

1642
01:22:01,421 --> 01:22:03,173
We will choose the right time to do it

1643
01:22:03,173 --> 01:22:04,967
when it's correct
for the mission of the company.

1644
01:22:04,967 --> 01:22:06,969
‐ What are you looking for?

1645
01:22:06,969 --> 01:22:09,221
‐ I want to elevate
the world's consciousness.

1646
01:22:09,221 --> 01:22:11,473
‐ Okay, so when you do that,
then you can go public?

1647
01:22:11,473 --> 01:22:12,724
‐ It's not one or the other.

1648
01:22:12,724 --> 01:22:14,852
When I feel that to achieve that mission,

1649
01:22:14,852 --> 01:22:17,938
going public will help it,
that will be the day.

1650
01:22:21,775 --> 01:22:23,819
INTERVIEWER:
Were you anticipating

1651
01:22:23,819 --> 01:22:26,071
WeWork's S1 when it came out?

1652
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:29,074
‐ No. I remember I was
on vacation, it was in August,

1653
01:22:29,074 --> 01:22:30,909
and I remember telling my family

1654
01:22:30,909 --> 01:22:33,078
when someone sent me a link to it,

1655
01:22:33,078 --> 01:22:35,080
and I started reading the first few pages,

1656
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,875
I said, "I apologize.
I'm out for the weekend,"

1657
01:22:37,875 --> 01:22:41,044
because this was just too good
and I needed to read through this.

1658
01:22:41,044 --> 01:22:43,380
It felt more like a, uh...

1659
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:45,924
a novel written by someone
who was shrooming

1660
01:22:45,924 --> 01:22:47,467
than an S1.

1661
01:22:48,594 --> 01:22:50,679
RANDALL:
<i>An S1 is a form you have to fill out</i>

1662
01:22:50,679 --> 01:22:52,556
<i>that's a precursor to going public.</i>

1663
01:22:53,599 --> 01:22:56,935
<i>It's a first introduction</i>
<i>to your company, to the world,</i>

1664
01:22:56,935 --> 01:22:59,855
<i>where you're representing</i>
<i>that these are the facts.</i>

1665
01:22:59,855 --> 01:23:03,650
But that means you've gotta come clean,
and there are a lot of details in there,

1666
01:23:04,067 --> 01:23:07,362
<i>and in WeWork's case,</i>
<i>the devil was in the details.</i>

1667
01:23:08,697 --> 01:23:10,908
‐ So the first red flag was on page one.

1668
01:23:10,908 --> 01:23:13,118
<i>It says, "We dedicate this</i>
<i>to the energy of We ‐‐</i>

1669
01:23:13,118 --> 01:23:16,163
<i>greater than any one of us</i>
<i>but inside each of us."</i>

1670
01:23:16,163 --> 01:23:18,832
I mean, for God sakes,
they're renting fucking desks.

1671
01:23:18,832 --> 01:23:21,877
ELIOT: <i>I was actually on vacation</i>
<i>in the middle of Austria,</i>

1672
01:23:21,877 --> 01:23:23,754
<i>hiking with some friends,</i>

1673
01:23:23,754 --> 01:23:26,673
and then I get to a place
where there's a little service.

1674
01:23:26,673 --> 01:23:28,175
[bird chirps, phone chimes]

1675
01:23:28,175 --> 01:23:30,677
<i>I just start getting</i>
<i>these texts and emails,</i>

1676
01:23:30,677 --> 01:23:32,387
and it's like "WTF."

1677
01:23:32,387 --> 01:23:34,598
And like, "Oh, my God!"

1678
01:23:34,598 --> 01:23:36,517
And I was like,
"I think I know what happened."

1679
01:23:38,268 --> 01:23:40,062
MAUREEN:
<i>Almost everyone you talked to</i>

1680
01:23:40,062 --> 01:23:44,858
had a different item
that horrified them. [laughs]

1681
01:23:44,858 --> 01:23:46,610
<i>So like one by one, they would say,</i>

1682
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:49,696
<i>"I cannot believe his wife</i>
<i>is choosing his successor,"</i>

1683
01:23:49,696 --> 01:23:53,867
or, "So egregious that he would
have these 20‐1 voting shares."

1684
01:23:53,867 --> 01:23:57,829
Or, "I can't believe the company
is paying him $6 million

1685
01:23:57,829 --> 01:24:02,543
for the trademark to the word 'we'
in the company name."

1686
01:24:02,543 --> 01:24:04,670
DEREK:
<i>He was buying buildings,</i>

1687
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:07,548
<i>and then asking WeWork</i>

1688
01:24:07,548 --> 01:24:09,633
to lease those buildings from him.

1689
01:24:09,633 --> 01:24:13,053
<i>And then he took $700 million</i>
<i>out of this company</i>

1690
01:24:13,053 --> 01:24:17,266
<i>at the very time he was asking the public</i>
<i>to put money in the company.</i>

1691
01:24:17,266 --> 01:24:19,393
‐ With many of these unicorn IPOs,

1692
01:24:19,393 --> 01:24:22,646
the CO is mentioned anywhere
between 12 and 40 times.

1693
01:24:22,646 --> 01:24:26,441
In the case of Adam Neumann,
it was 170 times.

1694
01:24:26,441 --> 01:24:27,776
[computer key clicking]

1695
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:29,987
<i>If you tell a 30‐something male</i>

1696
01:24:29,987 --> 01:24:34,116
that he's Jesus Christ,
he's inclined to believe you.

1697
01:24:34,116 --> 01:24:36,410
ELIOT:
<i>Rebekah is very involved</i>

1698
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:39,288
<i>in the part of the document</i>
<i>that people laughed at,</i>

1699
01:24:39,288 --> 01:24:41,999
<i>and they were spending</i>
<i>a lot of time in the Hamptons.</i>

1700
01:24:41,999 --> 01:24:45,669
<i>And they had this sort of constant string</i>
<i>of WeWork employees</i>

1701
01:24:45,669 --> 01:24:49,089
who would get a seaplane or helicopter
to go out to the Hamptons

1702
01:24:49,089 --> 01:24:51,800
just to meet with them on some IPO stuff.

1703
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:53,927
You just keep reading it and be like,

1704
01:24:53,927 --> 01:24:56,972
"Oh, my God, did anyone pr‐‐
like, look at this

1705
01:24:56,972 --> 01:24:59,308
and tell them what
it was gonna look like?"

1706
01:24:59,308 --> 01:25:01,685
<i>The reality is that, like, people</i>
<i>had been telling Adam that for a while</i>

1707
01:25:01,685 --> 01:25:03,770
<i>but he didn't care; he thought</i>
<i>that people would look past it</i>

1708
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:05,689
or he wanted to enrich himself

1709
01:25:05,689 --> 01:25:08,066
and thought that
it wouldn't be a big deal.

1710
01:25:11,153 --> 01:25:14,281
<i>Meanwhile, he was around WeWork less.</i>

1711
01:25:14,281 --> 01:25:16,992
<i>He went on a month‐long</i>
<i>birthday celebration</i>

1712
01:25:16,992 --> 01:25:20,621
<i>where he went to the Maldives to surf.</i>

1713
01:25:20,621 --> 01:25:23,081
You know, I think generally he was seen

1714
01:25:23,081 --> 01:25:26,376
as more erratic and nervous and...

1715
01:25:26,376 --> 01:25:28,128
<i>in hindsight,</i>
<i>he probably had a view</i>

1716
01:25:28,128 --> 01:25:30,255
<i>that maybe this has gone too far.</i>

1717
01:25:33,217 --> 01:25:36,845
<i>Him going surfing was a way</i>
<i>of avoiding reality...</i>

1718
01:25:38,764 --> 01:25:41,767
<i>and keeping the high life</i>
<i>going as much as he could.</i>

1719
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:48,398
COMMENTATOR 1: <i>This company has</i>
<i>just been savaged after its S1 came out.</i>

1720
01:25:48,398 --> 01:25:51,276
COMMENTATOR 2: <i>The price has</i>
<i>come down and down and down.</i>

1721
01:25:51,276 --> 01:25:54,863
COMMENTATOR 3:
<i>$47 billion dropped down to 10 to 15.</i>

1722

COMMENTATOR 4:
<i>Every day now they're trying to come up</i>

1723
01:25:56,573 --> 01:25:59,076
<i>with something to salvage this IPO,</i>
<i>and I don't know if they're gonna do it.</i>

1724
01:26:00,369 --> 01:26:01,828
‐ We'll clean it up. I think we're great,

1725
01:26:01,828 --> 01:26:03,956
and I think we're preparing
for the roadshow right now.

1726
01:26:03,956 --> 01:26:05,415
Just hope my hair is good.

1727
01:26:05,415 --> 01:26:07,918
WOMAN: Your hair looks great.
‐ Okay.

1728
01:26:07,918 --> 01:26:09,753
This is harder than 20‐foot waves.

1729
01:26:09,753 --> 01:26:11,588
MAN: [laughing] I get it.
‐ You know why?

1730
01:26:11,588 --> 01:26:13,799
'Cause I control the 20‐foot waves.

1731
01:26:13,799 --> 01:26:16,760
[laughter, woman responding indistinctly]

1732
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:19,263
I'll take a 20‐foot wave...

1733
01:26:19,263 --> 01:26:21,515
every day for the next 10 days.

1734

MAN: I'm scared of drowning
just thinking about it.

1735
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:26,603
‐ All right.

1736
01:26:28,522 --> 01:26:32,067
Real estate is going
through a fundamental shift.

1737
01:26:32,067 --> 01:26:34,611
From a "fixed cost per seat" commodity...

1738
01:26:34,611 --> 01:26:36,154
MAUREEN:
<i>The world was kind of up in arms</i>

1739
01:26:36,154 --> 01:26:40,659
<i>about how egregious this company was.</i>

1740
01:26:40,659 --> 01:26:43,287
<i>But Adam had to go public anyway.</i>

1741
01:26:43,287 --> 01:26:45,873
‐ ...have a 12‐year headstart.

1742
01:26:45,873 --> 01:26:48,000
‐ There's a two‐week period you start

1743
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,502
marketing your shares
officially to investors.

1744
01:26:50,502 --> 01:26:52,880
<i>It's called a roadshow.</i>

1745
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,883
<i>Kind of like a central part</i>
<i>of the roadshow</i>

1746
01:26:55,883 --> 01:26:58,010
<i>is a video that goes along with it.</i>

1747
01:26:58,010 --> 01:27:02,514
So, they had filmed
portions of it already.

1748
01:27:02,514 --> 01:27:05,809
So theoretically he was just
gonna do his part of it,

1749
01:27:05,809 --> 01:27:07,644
they can edit it in.

1750
01:27:07,644 --> 01:27:10,189
‐ Fixed cost commodity,
fixed cost commodity.

1751
01:27:10,189 --> 01:27:11,440
Fixed cost commodity...

1752
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,650
ELIOT:
<i>Adam kept delaying,</i>

1753
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:17,779
<i>and even literally would leave</i>

1754
01:27:17,779 --> 01:27:20,282
waiting, set up for him to come.

1755
01:27:20,282 --> 01:27:24,703
They spent hundreds of thousand dollars
on shoots that Adam didn't go to.

1756
01:27:27,956 --> 01:27:29,541
WOMAN:
That one sounded great.

1757
01:27:29,541 --> 01:27:30,959
‐ Thank you.

1758
01:27:30,959 --> 01:27:33,295
MAUREEN: <i>It seems kind of,</i>
<i>like, it's procrastination,</i>

1759
01:27:33,295 --> 01:27:35,339
but, you know, was there something deeper,

1760
01:27:35,339 --> 01:27:38,634
I don't know, of why you don't
show up to film this thing?

1761
01:27:40,177 --> 01:27:45,098
<i>Finally they start filming him,</i>
<i>but that day he was just off.</i>

1762
01:27:45,098 --> 01:27:46,517
‐ Just a second.

1763
01:27:46,517 --> 01:27:48,936
Zack, you need the sentences
to be full for me.

1764
01:27:48,936 --> 01:27:50,854
So whenever you have
a dead space like this,

1765
01:27:50,854 --> 01:27:52,523
put that up there.

1766
01:27:52,523 --> 01:27:55,150
‐ In general, he's an incredible speaker
if you see him,

1767
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:56,652
but he can't really
read off a teleprompter.

1768
01:27:56,652 --> 01:27:58,237
He struggles with that.

1769
01:27:58,237 --> 01:28:00,697
‐ Yeah, the reason
it's a little hard for me is,

1770
01:28:00,697 --> 01:28:03,075
I'm not a guy who reads
from a script, that's the thing.

1771
01:28:03,075 --> 01:28:05,494
To do it totally free, though,
I need to, I can't...

1772
01:28:05,494 --> 01:28:08,747
I'm doing word‐for‐word so I'm gonna
need to loosen it up a little bit.

1773
01:28:08,747 --> 01:28:10,624
MAUREEN:
<i>And I think as the day wore on,</i>

1774
01:28:10,624 --> 01:28:13,377
<i>it just went on and on and on and on.</i>

1775
01:28:13,377 --> 01:28:15,212
And he seemed more frazzled

1776
01:28:15,212 --> 01:28:17,714
and wasn't getting through it
and wasn't making sense.

1777
01:28:17,714 --> 01:28:19,299
‐ Based on our savor...

1778
01:28:19,299 --> 01:28:22,302
Agh! Ugh! Let's go.

1779
01:28:22,302 --> 01:28:25,430
MAUREEN:
<i>It became somewhat like a party.</i>

1780
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:27,599
<i>It just almost like</i>
<i>devolved the whole night.</i>

1781
01:28:27,599 --> 01:28:31,270
‐ The employees of all companies
all need the same thing.

1782
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:33,730
Wellness, food.

1783
01:28:33,730 --> 01:28:37,276
MAUREEN: <i>He just didn't do</i>
<i>a good job by everyone there.</i>

1784
01:28:37,276 --> 01:28:40,404
And I think a lot of people who
were there were quite stressed.

1785
01:28:40,404 --> 01:28:42,865
They're like, "This has to get done.
We're supposed to do this tomorrow."

1786
01:28:43,949 --> 01:28:47,828
<i>It's almost like,</i>
<i>this is your worst nightmare.</i>

1787
01:28:47,828 --> 01:28:50,622
‐ This is who I am. This is what I do.

1788
01:28:50,622 --> 01:28:53,917
I tackle something until it's right.

1789
01:28:53,917 --> 01:28:55,669
I will not stop.

1790
01:28:58,422 --> 01:29:00,632
This is what no one's
understanding right now,

1791
01:29:00,632 --> 01:29:03,343
but it's okay because
we'll make sure they learn.

1792
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:08,223
ELIOT:
<i>And then the next morning,</i>

1793
01:29:08,223 --> 01:29:11,268
they decide...
"No, it's just not gonna happen.

1794
01:29:11,268 --> 01:29:13,020
We need to call it off."

1795
01:29:17,441 --> 01:29:19,776
MAUREEN:
<i>Adam came in to WeWork's office.</i>

1796
01:29:19,776 --> 01:29:22,613
<i>He comes in, he's more</i>
<i>dressed up than usual.</i>

1797
01:29:22,613 --> 01:29:25,282
<i>And gives an all‐hands talk.</i>

1798
01:29:25,282 --> 01:29:29,119
And there he basically told all the staff,

1799
01:29:29,119 --> 01:29:30,579
"This doesn't mean the IPO's off.

1800
01:29:30,579 --> 01:29:33,457
"Like, we're gonna come back
and this is gonna be amazing

1801
01:29:33,457 --> 01:29:37,002
and, um, we will do
an IPO later this year."

1802
01:29:37,002 --> 01:29:40,380
But like everything behind the scenes
was beginning to happen

1803
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:42,424
to start to oust him.

1804
01:29:45,385 --> 01:29:47,721
ELIOT:
<i>At the time, it was less known</i>

1805
01:29:47,721 --> 01:29:51,350
<i>that Adam was this totally erratic CEO</i>

1806
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:53,268
<i>that had sort of messianic statements</i>

1807
01:29:53,268 --> 01:29:56,605
and was doing things in a way
that a lot of people would call crazy.

1808
01:29:56,605 --> 01:30:01,276
Uh, and so we basically
laid that out in a story.

1809
01:30:02,611 --> 01:30:05,489
<i>The signature anecdote to the thing</i>
<i>that probably got the most attention</i>

1810
01:30:05,489 --> 01:30:10,244
<i>was about how he took</i>
<i>a plane trip with friends to Israel,</i>

1811
01:30:10,244 --> 01:30:11,995
<i>and they were smoking pot on the plane,</i>

1812
01:30:11,995 --> 01:30:15,374
and then in Israel
they didn't finish all the pot

1813
01:30:15,374 --> 01:30:17,209
and so they stuffed some in a cereal box.

1814
01:30:18,293 --> 01:30:21,255
<i>The crew on the plane finds it</i>
<i>and is sort of incensed.</i>

1815
01:30:22,923 --> 01:30:24,550
And so they recall the plane.

1816
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:27,427
Uh, and so then Adam has to find
his own way back from Israel.

1820
01:30:38,105 --> 01:30:41,108

and your investors lose money,

1821

he became pretty much
untouchable on Wall Street.

1824
01:30:51,577 --> 01:30:53,871

That may not be the most fulfilling answer
for a lot of people,

the reason that maybe
he resonates with people

1911
01:35:52,711 --> 01:35:56,215
is because it felt like he was close.

1912
01:35:59,009 --> 01:36:02,930

1916
01:36:18,028 --> 01:36:21,365
which maybe is harmful for
other entrepreneurs to follow,

1917
01:36:21,365 --> 01:36:25,494
or he's embodied the American dream
in a way that worries us

1918
01:36:25,494 --> 01:36:28,956
because it was so attractive
and it was so intoxicating

1919
01:36:28,956 --> 01:36:31,416

1924

I hope continue to last.

1925
01:36:54,523 --> 01:36:57,359
Like especially as we sit
in this time of COVID

1926
01:36:57,359 --> 01:37:00,237
and we're, you know,
people are working from home,

1927
01:37:00,237 --> 01:37:04,157
and, you know,
I, myself, have been inside,

1928
01:37:04,157 --> 01:37:07,661
mostly inside for,
you know, months and months.

1929
01:37:07,661 --> 01:37:11,206
And it is on the days that I get
to interact with other people

1930
01:37:11,206 --> 01:37:14,793
that I come home and I'm like,
"Wow, that was a fulfilling day."

1937
01:37:52,539 --> 01:37:56,084
<i>The vision of us working together,</i>

1938
01:37:56,084 --> 01:37:59,755
