00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,539
Who are we?

2
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:54,218
Are we simply what others
want us to be?

3
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:58,343
Are we destined to a fate
beyond our control?

4
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,642
Or can we evolve?

5
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:06,017
Become... something more?

00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,335
♪ She'll find the note ♪

7
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:12,444
♪ I left hangin' on her door ♪

8
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:13,896
Can you change the station?

9
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,232
When the song's over, honey.

10
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,068
You said that two songs ago.

11
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,699
You know this is
a classic, right?

12
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,997
Okay, how about
I make you a promise?

13
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,995
When you're old enough
to drive,

14
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,873
you can listen to whatever
music you want. Hmm?

15
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:31,125
That a deal?

16
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,881
- John.
- Wasn't me.

17
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,055
Jean, was that... Did you?

18
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:42,098
I didn't do anything.

21
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,284
Quiet.

22
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,405
Quiet.

23
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,834
Quiet!

24
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,231
She doesn't have a scratch on her.

25
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,153
No internal injuries.

26
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,450
And you're sure she was in the car?

27
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,777
Yeah.

28
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,450
Who's gonna tell her?

29
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,368
Thank you.

30
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,252
Hello.

31
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,174
Where are my parents?

32
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,633
My name's Charles Xavier, and...

33
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,431
They're dead.

34
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,849
Aren't they?

35
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,472
Yes, they are.

36
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:57,185
And I'm very sorry
to have to tell you that.

37
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,488
So what happens to me now?

38
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,824
Well, that's why I'm here, actually.

39
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,200
You see, I have a school

40
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,625
that is for young people,
who are like you.

41
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:14,918
Special.

42
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,291
Special is just
a nice word for...

43
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,294
Weird? Or crazy?

44
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,921
Yep.

45
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,003
Yep, sometimes it is.

46
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:25,970
Ooh.

47
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,218
Sometimes, it can be a word

48
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,426
used to describe people
who are significant.

49
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,351
Or amazing. Or...

50
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,397
Or just... just really cool.

51
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,522
You've got gifts, Jean.

52
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,439
Do you know what?

53
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,906
Take this pen, right.

54
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,704
It's something that...

55
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,909
Well, actually, just take it.

56
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,459
It's a gift.

57
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,841
Now, you could choose to draw

58
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,759
a really good picture
with that...

59
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:09,590
or you could use it
to poke someone's eyes out.

60
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,972
But either way,
it's still just a pen.

61
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,770
It's just a gift.

62
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,223
And what you choose
to do with your gift,

63
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,900
well, that's
entirely up to you.

64
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,942
But if you want to use it
to do good stuff...

65
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,446
well, I can help.

66
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,865
You're not like
the other doctors.

67
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:35,828
No.

68
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,918
And you're not like
the other patients.

69
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,731
What do you think?

70
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,784
I can't stay here.

71
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,579
Okay. Why not?

72
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,407
It's too nice.

73
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,034
I...

74
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,339
- I break things.
- Well, how does this sound:

75
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,634
If you break something,
anything, I can fix it.

76
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,427
Not anything.

77
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,888
I can help you.

78
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,995
I can help you so that you never
have to break things ever again.

79
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,811
You think you can fix me too.

80
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,688
No.

81
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:49,023
No, because
you are not broken.

82
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:08,674
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

83
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:14,758
six, five, four,
three, two, one...

84
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,852
Engines throttling up.

85
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,582
Three engines now at 104%.

86
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,671
Hey, I'm...
I'm picking something up here.

87
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,466
Ma'am, I've got something
on sat six.

88
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,473
Houston, we have a problem.

89
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,707
Space Shuttle Endeavour
has encountered problems on its mission.

90
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,542
- I know what you're thinking.
- That's my trick.

91
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,419
And the answer is no.
The jet can't get that high.

92
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,059
Even with the new booster rockets
and all your modifications?

93
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,611
They're built for acceleration,
not elevation, okay?

94
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,566
Not this. No.

95
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,429
They've lost thrust vector control.

96
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,739
Trajectory settings are irregular,

97
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,913
likely from the constant engine burn.

98
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,707
Oxygen generation is down...

99
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,955
Yes? Yes, this is he.

100
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,372
- Charles?
- Mr. President.

101
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,253
Are you seeing this on TV?

102
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,925
Yes, I'm watching now.

103
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,253
Hank?

104
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,303
Yeah.

105
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,564
It's a simple extraction.

106
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,857
We go into space,

107
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,730
we get the astronauts,
we bring them home.

108
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,358
- Any questions?
- Yeah, like a thousand.

109
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,814
We don't have time
for a thousand.

110
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,023
So we're going to space?

111
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,109
Yes, Kurt,
we are going into space.

112
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,694
We're doing space
missions now. Cool.

113
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,245
Will the X-Jet
even get that high?

114
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,789
- Well, technically, the...
- It will get us there.

115
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,287
Let's go.

116
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,331
Are you okay with this?

117
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,838
I forget sometimes
you can read minds.

118
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,338
I didn't need
to read your mind.

119
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,762
It's written all over your face.

120
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,761
You tell me it's good,
it's good.

121
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,013
If anything goes wrong,

122
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,719
I'll turn us around
in a heartbeat.

123
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,563
I know you will.

124
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,125
A second ship has been spotted in the sky.

125
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,866
We are being told the president

126
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,632
has called in the aid
of the X-Men.

127
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,665
Ladies and gentlemen of NASA,
this is the voice of Charles Xavier.

128
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,872
Could somebody please
apprise me of the situation?

129
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,049
We were picking up
solar flares.

130
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,548
We believe the heat
shorted out their electricity.

131
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,924
They lost control,
communication, orientation,

132
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,596
pretty much everything.

133
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,050
Not to worry, Mission Control.
Help is on the way.

134
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,528
I think this is not as much
fun as I thought it would be.

135
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,183
That's a solar flare?

136
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,560
I've never seen
a reading like this.

137
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,287
The orientation thruster's misfiring.

138
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,249
- That cabin won't hold for long.
- Kurt, can you get in there?

139
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,960
It's spinning too fast.
I can't see inside the window.

140
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,171
Scott, I need you
to blast that thruster,

141
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,880
slow down the spin.

142
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,743
Kurt, take Peter. Go!

143
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,834
Storm, seal those cracks.

144
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,089
Be right back.

145
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,809
Oh, shit.

146
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,512
- Strap in, we're headed home.
- Wait.

147
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,401
Our commander, he's not here.

148
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,036
He was in the airlock
working on the thruster.

149
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,164
The heat signature's
rising fast.

150
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,371
I can't hold it any longer.

151
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,127
We gotta get out of here.
I said strap in.

152
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,630
No, Raven. No.
We're not leaving anyone behind.

153
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,053
I am not putting this team
in more danger.

154
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,131
What about their team?

155
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,625
Jean can hold
that shuttle together.

156
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,516
Can't you, Jean?

157
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,766
You know you can do anything
you set your mind to.

158
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,564
I can hold the ship together
but not from here.

159
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,063
- I need to get inside.
- The heat's spiking.

160
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,965
We've got less than a minute
till those flares hit.

161
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,320
She said she can do it.

162
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,315
Thirty seconds.

163
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,779
Count it down. Go.

164
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,722
We got 20 seconds.

165
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,277
Ten...

166
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,356
nine, eight...

167
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,156
seven, six...

168
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,952
five...

169
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,447
four...

170
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,744
three...

171
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,991
two...

172
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,083
one.

173
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,377
Where's Jean?
Kurt, where is she?

174
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,710
- Where is she?
- I'm sorry!

175
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,885
Brace for impact.

176
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,949
Is every...

177
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,532
Is everybody okay?

178
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,702
Yeah, we're okay.

179
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,211
So let's go home.

180
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,345
- Yay, X-Men! Woo!
- Yeah!

181
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,481
Yeah! X-Men!

182
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,839
That's enough,
boys and girls. That's enough.

183
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,931
The X-Men have today done
an incredibly brave thing.

184
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,760
They've once again proved to humanity
exactly why they need us,

185
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,015
people like yourselves.

186
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,938
The president sends his regards,

187
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,061
as well as his
heartfelt gratitude.

188
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,895
And, as for myself,
I've never been prouder.

189
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,861
Enjoy yourselves.
You certainly deserve it.

190
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,158
In fact, you all do.

191
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,610
No more class,
the end of the day.

192
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,541
Jean?

193
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,951
You gave us quite a scare up there.
How are you feeling?

194
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,873
Actually, I... I feel fine.

195
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,003
- Hank?
- Yeah?

196
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,196
Would you take a look at Jean?

197
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,552
Standard medical
for anyone injured in the field.

198
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,004
Thank you.

199
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,976
You know, the president
was almost sending his condolences.

200
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,646
- She should be dead.
- Thankfully, she's not.

201
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,105
I basically did everything.

202
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,561
I mean, Jean did a little,
like towards the end,

203
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,362
but it was mostly all me.

204
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,110
You put us in danger, Charles.

205
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,038
You put those kids in danger.

206
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,293
They're not kids anymore, Raven.

207
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,872
And I care about their safety
just as much as you do.

208
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,128
Are you sure about that?

209
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,801
'Cause we're taking bigger
and bigger risks.

210
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:00,969
And for what?

211
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:04,094
Please, tell me it's not your ego.

212
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:05,891
Being on the cover
of magazines,

213
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,014
getting a medal from the president.

214
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,470
You like it, don't you?

215
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,521
As opposed to being
hunted and despised?

216
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,974
Well, you know, actually, I do.

217
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,151
It's all just a means
to an end, Raven.

218
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,774
- What end is that?
- Keeping us safe.

219
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,259
You should understand
better than anyone

220
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,194
that we're only ever
one bad day away

221
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,526
from them starting to see us
as the enemy again.

222
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,862
So, what?
We wear matching costumes

223
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,434
and smile in pictures
to make everyone feel safe?

224
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,186
That is a small price to pay
for keeping the peace.

225
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,452
- By risking our people to save theirs?
- Yes! Yes!

226
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,378
It's funny.

227
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,551
I can't actually remember the last time

228
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,094
you were the one risking something.

229
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,637
And by the way,

230
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,136
the women are always saving
the men around here.

231
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,639
You might wanna think about
changing the name to X-Women.

232
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,347
Your heartbeat's strong,
pulse is good,

233
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,307
brain activity is normal.

234
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:57,654
The genetic reading,

235
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,854
I'm gonna take another look at.

236
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,734
What can't be right?

237
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,516
Did you just read my mind
without permission?

238
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,658
Sorry, I didn't mean to,
but what can't be right?

239
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,879
Whatever happened up there
made you stronger.

240
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,736
You know, I've never seen
a power reading like this.

241
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,048
You're-You're literally...
I mean, you're off the charts.

242
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,380
So what does that mean?

243
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,715
It means, um...

244
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,306
we'll have to build a better machine.

245
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,560
But... how do you feel?

246
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,059
I feel good.

247
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,394
Good.

248
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,901
Well, as far as I can tell,
you're good to go.

249
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,199
- You can head upstairs.
- All right.

250
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,986
Thanks, Hank.

251
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,743
Hank said that?

252
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,453
- "Off the charts"?
- He did.

253
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,504
The big blue furry guy?
The doctor? That Hank?

254
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,082
That's the one. Why?

255
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,503
You a little intimidated, maybe?

256
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,589
Constantly.

257
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,683
- Jean. Jean...
- Hmm?

258
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,100
Are you...
Are you sure you're okay?

259
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:19,692
I'm better than okay.
God, I feel great, I do.

260
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,317
I don't know, I feel like
everything is just...

261
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,148
turned up.

262
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,942
Yeah.

263
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,155
- No, it's just...
- Just what?

264
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,160
I thought I lost you today.

265
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,744
I know.

266
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,585
But I came back to you.

267
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,801
I'll always come back to you.

268
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,251
Is that Luna?

269
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,212
Probably just squirrels.

270
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,258
Mm...?

271
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,507
I'm just gonna check on her.
I'll be right back.

272
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,633
Just stay.

273
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,767
- Tell her to shut up.
- Luna!

274
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,647
Luna!

275
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,042
Luna!

276
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,667
Honey!

277
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,838
What is it?
What is it, honey?

278
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:36,279
He's got the dumbest laugh.

279
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,658
That's not...

280
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,535
That's not how it happened.

281
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:42,084
- Oh, my God.
- That was...

282
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,544
Margaret?

283
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:52,966
What...?

284
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:07,025
♪ Put your hands on me ♪

285
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,818

00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,709
- This way.
- Okay.

292
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:34,469
One more?

293
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,387
Yeah, I'll go ahead
and finish this one.

294
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,555
Two more?

295
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,433
Uh, yeah.

296
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,400
♪ Put your hands on me ♪

297
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,649
- Hey.
- Rocks.

298
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,698
Thanks.

299
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,738
- How is she doing?
- She's, uh...

300
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,905
- thirsty.
- Yeah, I see that.

301
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,832
Does she seem okay to you?

302
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,831
For someone who's just been
hit with solar flares...

303
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:10,289
- I'd say she's doing pretty good.
- Thanks.

304
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,128
You know, it wasn't so long ago

305
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,046
we were throwing parties like this.

306
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,679
Now we're the only ones left.

307
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,387
Yeah. Last of the first class.

308
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,642
I've been thinking.

309
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:31,023
Maybe it's time for us to...
move on.

310
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,195
What do you...
Move on where?

311
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:36,524
I don't know.
It's just Charles.

312
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,950
Whatever is going on between
you two, it will blow over.

313
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,074
No, it won't.

314
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,451
I love him,
but he's different.

315
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,958
Everything is...
it's different now.

316
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,627
Yeah.

317
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,296
We changed the world
so we could live in it.

318
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,499
Yeah, but maybe
that's what we should go do.

319
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:56,051
Yeah, but this is our life.
This is what we wanted.

320
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,049
- Not like this.
- Raven...

321
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,133
It's not our life, Hank.
It's his.

322
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,811
What do you think the "X"
in X-Men stands for?

323
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,685
Charles and his X-Men
are where we turn

324
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:11,142
when facing our worst fears.

325
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,236
Thank you, Mr. President.

326
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,611
Thank you.

327
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,578
All I've really done
is create a world

328
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:27,624
in which children
can find peace and pride

329
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,793
in being different.

330
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,964
Now, I know that some of you
choose to call us "superheroes."

331
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:36,963
I must confess, I don't really
know what that word means,

332
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,414
but it is a damn sight better
than what you used to call us.

333
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,976
- Come dance with me.
- You wanna dance?

334
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,520
Come on, Scott.

335
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,357
Did... Did you hear
what the kids are calling you?

336
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,605
- Do I wanna know?
- Yeah.

337
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,186
Phoenix.

338
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,398
It's cool, right? You know,
a bird that rises from the dead.

339
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:00,733
Whoa!

340
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,411
Uh...

341
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,218
You okay? Hey, maybe
we should take a break.

342
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:08,369
- Jean.
- Stop.

343
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,157
Wait, wait, wait.

344
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,253
No, stop, stop, stop, stop.

345
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:21,921
It's Jean.

346
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,195
Jean. Jean, please.

347
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,013
Stop, stop, stop.

348
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,644
Stop, stop, stop!

349
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,358
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Charles.

350
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,394
I'm terribly sorry, everyone,
but I'm going to have to leave.

351
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,500
Thank you very, very much.

352
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,745
What is it?
What do you see?

353
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,292
Nothing.

354
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,212
Her mutation has grown
too powerful.

355
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,665
For the first time,
I can't penetrate her mind.

356
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,591
So that's what
we're doing down here?

357
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,260
Hank built Cerebro
to amplify my power.

358
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:47,681
I think that's the only way I'm going
to get inside her head now.

359
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,577
Hank, could you turn it up, please?

360
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,367
A little more. Thank you.

361
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,711
There she is.

362
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,911
- Yes, it is.
- Isn't that yummy?

363
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,893
Is it supposed
to look like this?

364
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,188
The mind of a psychic
is a fragile thing.

365
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,061
It takes only the slightest tap

366
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,937
to tip it in the wrong direction.

367
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:43,486
I had to make adjustments
to her mind when she was young.

368
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,194
What kind of adjustments?

369
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,776
Scaffolding.

370
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,704
Walls, rather,
to keep out all the trauma.

371
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,449
What did you do
to her, Charles?

372
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,956
I saved her.

373
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:05,046
I think that whatever happened
in space did something to her.

374
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,298
In the process,
those walls that I erected

375
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,425
are being torn down.

376
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,850
Quiet!

377
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,266
What is that?

378
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:20,849
That... is what I was trying
to save her from.

379
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:25,316
Table for one.
My usual.

380
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,154
What is that voice?

381
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,317
- No...
- Charles?

382
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,078
Charles?

383
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,076
She's waking up.

384
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:44,673
Jean?

385
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,297
Jean, don't be afraid.
It's only me.

386
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,553
I want you to remain calm,

387
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:52,756
and I'd like you to focus
on my voice.

388
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,804
Get out of my head.

389
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,064
Just stay calm, Jean.

390
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,526
She's fighting me.
I need you to turn it up.

391
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,364
I heard my father.

392
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:14,070
- He's alive.
- You're just hearing things.

393
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,075
Jean, your mind,
it needs rest.

394
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,456
You're...

395
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,374
You're lying to me.

396
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,287
I can sense it.

397
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:26,669
Turn it up.

398
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,422
- No, it's too much already.
- Don't do it, Hank.

399
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:30,823
- Hank.
- No, I won't do it.

400
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,180
For God's sake, Charles!

401
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,555
Get out of my head!

402
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:38,931
Charles!

403
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,307
- Charles!
- Charles!

404
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,891
Jean! Are you...

405
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,022
Are you okay?

406
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,321
What happened?
We were outside, and then...

407
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,490
You had an accident.
You blacked out.

408
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,862
Did I...
Did I do... do that?

409
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,913
It's fine.

410
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,167
- No, it's not fine.
- It was an accident.

411
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,095
I don't know
what's happening to me.

412
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,418
I can't control it.
I can't stay here, Scott.

413
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:08,589
I really, I need to go.

414
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:09,779
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?

415
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,919
I need to see...
I need to see my father.

416
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,682
- Your fa... Your father's...
- He's alive. I can hear him.

417
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,430
He died in the crash,
remember?

418
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,261
I'm sorry, Scott.
I need to go.

419
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,042
- Hang on, hang on, hang on.
- God, please let me go.

420
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,431
- Please.
- Slow down, please.

421
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:27,734
I can't control it when it comes.
I can't stop it.

422
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,607
Okay? I could hurt you again.

423
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,609
I'll take that chance.

424
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,528
I know.

425
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,076
I know.

426
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,624
But I won't.

427
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,159
- Is he gonna be all right?
- I'm gonna be fine.

428
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,077
- No, he's not fine.
- I'm going to be fine.

429
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,432
What did you see?

430
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,646
She's all desire.

431
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,521
All rage, all pain.

432
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,196
And it's all coming out at once.

433
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,365
Something's happening
to her, Raven.

434
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,409
She's changing.

435
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,696
Into what?

436
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,449
I don't know.

437
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,085
Jean's gone. She left.

438
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,003
- Gone where?
- I don't know.

439
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,651
Charles, you can track her
with your mind.

440
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,916
Not anymore.

441
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,672
She's grown too powerful,
even for me.

442
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,674
She said she was going
to see her father.

443
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,798
That doesn't make
any sense, right?

444
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,764
Prepare the jet.
We're going to bring her home.

445
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,096
"We"? Charles,
you're in no condition.

446
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,773
I have to stop this.
She's going to find...

447
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:52,019
She's going to find
nothing good there.

448
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:09,621
So this is all that's left
of the D'Bari Empire?

449
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:14,677
Greetings, Vuk.

450
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,002
Have you learned their language?

451
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,424
With ease.

452
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:21,302
What have you learned?

453
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:25,102
The power is being contained
inside one of them.

454
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,932
- This primitive species?
- She's stronger.

455
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,184
A mutant.

456
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:34,694
She has no idea
what's happening to her.

457
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,982
I can use that.

458
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,112
If we can control that power...

459
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,785
we can resurrect our race.

460
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,408
Begin again.

461
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,120
Here.

462
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,371
Where is she?

463
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,910
Can I help you?

464
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,208
Dad?

465
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,674
Jean.

466
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,103
How do you know
where we're going, Charles?

467
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,090
If you can't track her,
how do you know where she is?

468
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,854
You know how.

469
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,691
Jesus Christ.

470
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,403
What did you do?

471
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,368
I protected her.

472
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:13,369
From the truth.

473
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,340
There's another word for that.

474
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,546
He told me you were dead.

475
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,304
I never thought
I'd be back here.

476
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,556
It's the same.

477
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:34,723
All of it.

478
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:43,490
Can I get you something
to drink or-or eat?

479
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,616
Uh...

480
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,444
No, I'm good. I'm...

481
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,825
I'm really good.

482
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,245
It's so good to see you.

483
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:03,297
Um, I'll get you
some water, okay?

484
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,593
Quiet.

485
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,428
Jean?

486
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,447
All these photos, none of me.

487
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,287
You never looked for me.

488
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,660
- Jean...
- Why didn't you look for me?

489
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:17,617
Maybe we should sit down.

490
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,248
No, I don't wanna sit down.

491
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:21,580
Why didn't you come
looking for me?

492
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:24,841
And don't try to lie.
I can read your mind.

493
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,211
I can't handle her.

494
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,389
I don't even know what she is.

495
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,057
I do.

496
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,684
Then you'll take her?

497
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,227
You didn't even say goodbye.

498
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,105
I didn't get a chance
to say goodbye to your mother.

499
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,876
I was eight years old.

500
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,363
How could you do that to me?

501
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,486
You wanna come in?

502
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:54,116
Come all the way in.

503
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:56,698
Don't forget what you did.

504
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,587
I don't know. It's not me.

505
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,172
Quiet!

506
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,846
No. No.

507
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,316
I'm sorry, Jean...

508
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,235
but my whole world died that day.

509
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:35,745
And... you went with it.

510
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:43,666
Jean, don't, please.

511
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,962
Stop that.

512
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,084
Stop it.

513
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,166
It's not me. It's them.

514
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,242
You shouldn't have come here.

515
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,224
Why is that? We've only come
to bring you home, Jean.

516
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,206
I don't have a home.
You made sure of that.

517
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:22,705
Look, your father couldn't handle you,

518
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,331
and we took you in.

519
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,754
You told me
my father was dead,

520
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,377
and you used me for my powers.

521
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:31,505
No, that's just not true.
That's not what happened.

522
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,257
Jean, we can help you.

523
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,384
I can help you,
but you have to listen to me.

524
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:37,090
No. No, I don't.

525
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:38,675
Scott.

526
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,850
He lied to me, Scott.
About everything.

527
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:46,262
We'll figure everything out together.
Just come back to me.

528
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,199
Remember, you said
you'd always come back to me.

529
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,237
Come back to me.

530
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:58,914
Jean.

531
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,834
Stay away from me.
Stay away from me.

532
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,127
Stay away from me!

533
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:11,375
- Stop her quickly!
- Charles, wait, wait!

534
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:24,231
Jean, please!

535
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:04,010
Jean, stop!

536
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:06,687
- I've got the shot. I'm taking...
- No, you're not.

537
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,311
I'm sorry, Hank.
I want Raven to have a chance.

538
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:16,405
I told you to stay away.

539
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,153
That's never gonna happen.

540
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,911
Please. Stop.

541
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:24,864
Not until I know
you're gonna be okay.

542
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,996
Something's happening to me.

543
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:30,336
So come home.

544
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:32,129
Let me take care of you.

545
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,797
No, you can't.

546
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,671
You can't. You don't...

547
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:41,089
You don't know what it's like.

548
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,349
Then tell me.

549
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,056
When it comes...

550
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,477
people get hurt.

551
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,731
I'm not afraid of you, Jean.

552
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:54,821
Look at me.

553
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:56,820
Focus on my voice.

554
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,944
We're going to get
through this together.

555
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:00,900
I'm not giving up on you, Jean.

556
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,702
This is what family does.
We take care of each other.

557
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:05,989
You're my family, Jean.

558
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,620
No matter what.

559
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,710
Stop!

560
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,084
- Raven...
- I can't catch my breath.

561
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:59,084
No.

562
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,802
I love you.

563
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,880
What?

564
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,970
I...

565
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,775
Raven, please.

566
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:22,524
Raven.

567
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,364
Raven. I love you, Raven.

568
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:29,948
No.

569
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:33,792
No.

570
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,939
We are all at war,

571
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:04,695
at war with ourselves,

572
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:09,495
and Raven had been waging
that war for most of her life.

573
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,364
I hope now she's found peace.

574
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:17,495
Raven died doing
what she did best...

575
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:20,423
helping a friend,

576
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,215
a friend in need.

577
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,675
She is not gone.

578
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:30,717
She lives on, through me,

579
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,973
through us...

580
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,143
and through the spirit
of the X-Men.

581
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:47,317
Is it true?

582
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,197
Jean killed her?

583
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,622
She didn't know
what she was doing.

584
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,461
Jean lost control.

585
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,677
But she-she's still Jean.

586
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,509
She's still our friend.

587
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,091
We can still help her.
We can find her.

588
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:14,935
And bring her home.

589
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,983
That's... That's what
we're gonna do, okay?

590
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,071
It wasn't an accident, Scott.

591
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:37,663
She killed Raven.

592
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,210
Maybe you can't admit that
to yourself or to them,

593
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,083
but it's the truth.

594
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,833
That was not Jean,
not the Jean I know.

595
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:51,968
Sometimes you want to believe

596
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,050
people are something
that they are not.

597
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:58,472
And then, by the time
you realize who they are...

598
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:01,102
it's too late.

599
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:30,382
Do you know, this is where
I first met Raven.

600
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:38,519
She was just
this little girl, and...

601
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:41,393
she'd broken in,
looking for food.

602
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:43,558
I said she could stay,

603
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,860
and that she'd never have
to go hungry again.

604
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:51,236
And then, I think
I promised her a better life.

605
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:55,115
And then you took it from her.

606
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:57,822
- I beg your pardon?
- You heard me.

607
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:00,283
- Hank...
- This is your fault, Charles.

608
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:03,919
It's your fault she's dead.

609
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,793
- Come on, that's not fair.
- Fair? No, don't talk about fair.

610
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,653
You messed with the mind
of an eight-year-old girl.

611
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,155
You pushed down
all that pain and anger...

612
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,490
- Jean?
- ...where do you think it's gonna go?

613
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:12,970
I did that to help her.
What I do,

614
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:14,659
- I do to help all of them.
- Please, come on, please.

615
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:17,971
- You still can't see what you did wrong?
- It's just...

616
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,599
No, you need to face this, Charles!
You need to face it.

617
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,369
Come on, admit it
to me right now. Come on!

618
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,640
Admit it!

619
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:27,018
Charles, just admit
you were wrong, please.

620
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,865
You still can't.

621
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:38,996
I really hope
you feel better, Hank.

622
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:42,746
I hope that railing on me five minutes
after I put my foster sister in the grave

623
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:44,314
- has made you feel...
- This isn't about me.

624
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,274
You, know what? I know what
I did wrong, okay, Charles?

625
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,710
She was gonna leave.
Raven was gonna leave,

626
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:51,213
and I talked her out of it.

627
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:55,797
She saw what the rest of us didn't.

628
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,060
And what was that?

629
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:00,476
This whole time,
we've been trying

630
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:02,043
to protect these kids from the world,

631
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:04,472
when really, we should've been
protecting them from you.

632
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,864
I don't know
what's happening to me.

633
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:18,448
Why?

634
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,949
Why did I do that?

635
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,779
- No civilians past this...
- FBI.

636
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,662
Give us the room.

637
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,254
And who are you
supposed to be?

638
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,926
We're the ones who are going
to help you, Mr. Grey.

639
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,765
I didn't know
she was gonna come back.

640
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:28,435
I'm sorry for all this.

641
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:31,434
It's okay.

642
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:40,284
We just wanna get an accurate
picture of who Jean is.

643
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:42,657
Tell us about when you
gave her to the mutant.

644
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:48,121
Um...

645
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,582
Maybe, uh...

646
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:56,626
it might be better
if I talk to a lawyer.

647
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:02,594
I'm so sorry, Mr. Grey,

648
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:05,142
but I need to know
everything about her now.

649
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,932
This truly is
an unfortunate development.

650
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,311
Why-Why is that?

651
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:16,065
Because it's so much easier
to understand your language

652
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,737
when you're not screaming.

653
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:07,241
Who are you?

654
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,662
What are you doing here?

655
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:16,338
Answer the question.

656
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,392
Leave her.

657
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:32,638
Why are you here?

658
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,407
Are you hurt?

659
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:46,371
No.

660
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,696
You'll have to forgive them.

661
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:52,374
They're not accustomed
to uninvited guests.

662
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:55,373
Please.

663
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,597
Why don't you start
at the beginning?

664
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,345
Whose blood is that?

665
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:18,104
- What?
- On your shirt.

666
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,230
Whose blood is it?

667
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:23,689
Look, I'm not Charles.

668
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,780
I can't read your mind.

669
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,616
You hurt people.

670
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,036
- It's been a while.
- But you did.

671
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:42,257
Yes. What did you
come here to ask me?

672
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,881
How did you stop?

673
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,269
I've lived with vengeance
my whole life.

674
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,140
Ever since I was a child, I...

675
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:01,731
lost everyone I ever loved, so...

676
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:04,112
I hurt people.

677
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,235
Yes, killed people.

678
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:11,119
Killed whatever I thought
would make the pain go away.

679
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,244
It didn't,

680
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,576
no matter how many souls
I sent under...

681
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:22,297
so I stopped.

682
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:25,258
I don't know how to stop.

683
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,179
I don't know
what's happening to me.

684
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,022
When I lose control...

685
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:44,152
things happen, bad things...

686
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,611
to people I love.

687
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:56,873
Whose blood is that?

688
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:01,082
Isn't that why you came here?

689
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:03,289
- What do you think I can do for you?
- I don't know!

690
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,499
Yes, you do.
Whose blood is that?

691
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:07,363
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Did you hurt someone?

692
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,032
- Please, I...
- Answer the question, Jean.

693
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:10,887
- Stop, Erik, you're making me angry.
- Good!

694
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,464
I want you to be angry.

695
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,496
- Show me what happens, Jean.
- I don't wanna hurt you!

696
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,997
What happens when you're angry?
Show me.

697
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,602
- Show me what...
- Stop!

698
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,351
We've got military.

699
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:21,648
Inbound.

700
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,060
Stay here.

701
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,780
Two birds. US.

702
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:35,203
Tell everyone to stay calm,
but ready.

703
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,259
All right, that's far enough.

704
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:18,204
We have a legal right
to be here.

705
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,701
This land was given to us
by the US government.

706
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,706
We have no intention of taking it back.

707
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:25,955
We're not here for you.

708
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,540
We're looking for one
of the X-Men. Jean Grey.

709
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,751
I haven't seen her
in a long time.

710
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:32,574
Then you won't mind
if we look around.

711
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:35,305
I don't have a home.
You made sure of that.

712
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,578
Would you mind
if I came to your home...

713
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:37,704
This is what family does.

714
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:40,014
...unannounced and uninvited?

715
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,470
You're my family, Jean.

716
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,722
Look...

717
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,432
I know who you are.

718
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,602
- I don't wanna fight.
- No, you don't.

719
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,775
Then step aside.

720
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:54,533
We have the same rights
as you and your family.

721
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,453
And like I said,
we're not here for you.

722
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,990
We're here for a girl
who gave up those rights

723
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,700
when she attacked
a squad of police officers.

724
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,495
They have families, too.

725
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:09,923
Guess you didn't hear
about that.

726
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,169
We don't get the news out here, Captain.

727
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,931
Stop that.

728
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:23,762
I said stop that right now!

729
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,473
- It's not me.
- It's me.

730
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:29,443
Jean?

731
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:33,532
Jean!

732
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:37,159
Get down!

733
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,953
Get in the chopper and go!

734
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,163
I can't hold it!

735
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,874
Fall back! Fall back!

736
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:28,581
Let's go, move, move!

737
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,665
Let's go!
Hook in! Move it! Come on!

738
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,567
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Come on!

739
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:37,573
Give me your hand.
Help me!

740
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:55,656
Go!

741
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:00,067
- Leave this place!
- I need your help.

742
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:01,993
I thought you
protected mutants here.

743
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,163
I am protecting them...
from you.

744
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:08,367
You need to leave.

745
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:10,414
Go!

746
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:30,293
Word coming late tonight
that Congress is considering

747
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:32,478
temporary mutant internment facilities

748
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,560
for those whose powers
have been deemed

749
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:37,145
a clear and present danger
to human citizens.

750
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,152
This coming on the heels
of the Jean Grey incidents

751
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,404
which, after destroying
two communities,

752
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:44,828
and attacking police
and military personnel...

753
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:01,298
This is Charles Xavier.

754
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:03,630
I'd like to talk
to the president.

755
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:06,888
Mr. Xavier, this phone
will no longer be operational.

756
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:10,728
I have to tell him not to do this.

757
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:13,649
There's no need to throw away
everything that we've accomplished.

758
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,317
You have to give us a chance and...

759
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,450
If you break something, anything,

760
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:29,827
I can fix it.

761
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:31,454
Not anything.

762
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,673
An international search
is underway for Grey.

763
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,501
Authorities are urging citizens
to keep their distance.

764
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:42,051
Any sighting
should be reported

765
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:43,629
to the police immediately.

766
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,179
Government officials have...

767
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:46,757
This man was electrocuted...

768
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:49,264
Is that all you got?

769
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:52,895
Give me another.

770
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:16,498
Hello, Jean.

771
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:26,631
You can't control
my mind like theirs.

772
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,098
I'm not like them.

773
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:31,552
Same, please.

774
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:35,972
How did you find me?

775
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:40,064
Let's just say I have friends
in high places.

776
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:43,237
Who are you?

777
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:46,525
The better question is...

778
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:47,860
who are you?

779
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,364
Are you a scared little girl

780
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:51,367
who answers
to a man in a chair...

781
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,416
or are you the most powerful
creature on the planet?

782
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:01,081
I don't know who I am.

783
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:02,541
Yes, you do.

784
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:06,094
You're the girl
who everyone abandons.

785
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,555
Maybe they had good reason.

786
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,311
Because of what's inside you?

787
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:21,895
You're afraid of it because you think
it makes you bad, evil,

788
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:25,230
all the words you've been taught
to keep you in line.

789
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:28,692
Words created
a very long time ago

790
01:02:28,787 --> 01:02:30,869
by men with very little minds.

791
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:34,198
They can't begin to comprehend
what you are.

792
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:36,123
Even your X-Men.

793
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,868
And you can?

794
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:42,091
Charles?

795
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:46,585
Charles? Charles!

796
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,467
- Hey, Hank's not in class.
- What?

797
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:50,842
Hank's not in class.

798
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:53,762
Did you check his quarters?

799
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:56,139
Yeah, he's not there either.

800
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:13,161
Where are the rest of them?

801
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:14,867
No, I'm alone.

802
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:17,707
What, no Charles?

803
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:23,125
If you're looking for Jean...

804
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,674
- she's gone.
- No, I know that.

805
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:28,547
Then why are you here, Hank?

806
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:31,050
You have eyes and ears
around the world

807
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:33,132
to help you find mutants
for this place.

808
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,092
I want you
to help me find Jean.

809
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:38,394
I've no reason to find her.

810
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,312
Not for me.

811
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,936
Do it for Raven.

812
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:44,317
Did she send you?

813
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:48,362
You don't know?

814
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:53,276
Know what, Hank?

815
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:55,821
Raven's dead.

816
01:03:58,126 --> 01:03:59,491
Jean killed her.

817
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:23,310
I need you
to help me find Jean.

818
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:31,735
If I find her, I'll kill her.

819
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:34,909
I know.

820
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,677
They know who I am?

821
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:54,800
Yes.

822
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:58,095
And they're not afraid of me?

823
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:03,396
The only person here
afraid of your power...

824
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:05,557
is you.

825
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:25,919
Go, gather the others. If she can't
control it, then we will destroy it.

826
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:34,386
This is what you wanted to show me?

827
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:35,803
No.

828
01:05:36,516 --> 01:05:39,007
This is what I want to show you.

829
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:59,740
What entered you in space
was not a solar flare.

830
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,530
And it was not an accident.

831
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,040
It was drawn to you.

832
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:08,494
What-What was it?

833
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:11,957
A pure and unimaginably
powerful cosmic force.

834
01:06:13,011 --> 01:06:15,047
We saw it enter you in space.

835
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:19,673
We were there, Jean,
following that force.

836
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:22,175
Why?

837
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:25,478
Because it's the spark that
gave life to the universe...

838
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:28,853
and the flame
that consumed my world.

839
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:35,735
What remains of my people
searched the stars

840
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,690
for that power,
to control it,

841
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:41,744
but it destroyed everything
it ever came into contact with.

842
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,321
Until you.

843
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:46,950
Why me?

844
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,877
Because you're stronger
than you know.

845
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:53,377
Because you're special, Jean.

846
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:02,595
With my help, you could
control what's inside you.

847
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:07,353
Harness that power
to create whole new worlds...

848
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:10,440
turn dust into water...

849
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:13,358
water into life.

850
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:18,197
It's your destiny, Jean,
to become something greater...

851
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:23,912
to evolve into the greatest force
in the galaxy.

852
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:40,170
I told you they could
never understand you.

853
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:44,223
And what they don't
understand, they fear.

854
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,266
And what they fear...

855
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:48,720
They seek to destroy.

856
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:55,022
Did Raven suffer?

857
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,237
Not for long.

858
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:04,365
I know we've had our...

859
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,239
differences in the past, but...

860
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,040
We both love Raven.

861
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:12,921
Yes.

862
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:17,340
Yes, we did.

863
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:20,422
There's been a sighting
of the girl.

864
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:21,513
Where?

865
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:23,008
New York.

866
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,090
We'll have eyes on the ground
when we get there.

867
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:20,319
It's time.

868
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:28,111
We know where Jean is.

869
01:09:28,206 --> 01:09:29,642
I thought you said
you couldn't track her.

870
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:31,657
It wasn't me who found her.

871
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:33,161
It was Erik.

872
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:34,662
Hank's with him.

873
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:37,040
They're on their way to her,
and they're gonna kill her.

874
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,417
And anyone
who stands in their way.

875
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:42,421
Kurt, I'd like you to take
Scott and I there, but that's all.

876
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,281
I want you to leave us there
and then come home.

877
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:45,841
And me?

878
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:48,014
I'm not talking
to you now as X-Men.

879
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:51,426
Scott and I will go and fight
for Jean without you.

880
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:52,806
End of discussion.

881
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:56,606
Storm, I have lost
so many of the people I love.

882
01:09:57,527 --> 01:09:59,563
I'm not going
to ask you to go.

883
01:09:59,654 --> 01:10:00,939
I am.

884
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,400
We need you.

885
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,032
I need you.

886
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,451
- I've got your back.
- Look...

887
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:10,403
End of discussion.

888
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:18,786
Kurt, close your eyes.

889
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:21,247
I'll show you our destination.

890
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,390
Where are they?

891
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:53,863
She's in there.

892
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:56,950
Hello, old friend.

893
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:12,215
Save the "old friend" shit,
Charles.

894
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:13,720
And stay out of my way.

895
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:15,642
I'm sorry for what she did.

896
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:18,263
But I can't let you
go in there.

897
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:21,975
You're always sorry, Charles.
And there's always a speech.

898
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,436
But nobody cares anymore.

899
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:30,233
We do this here, now,
they'll see us as monsters.

900
01:11:30,328 --> 01:11:32,444
Violent freaks,
fighting on the streets of New York.

901
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:33,538
What did I tell you?

902
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:35,864
Damn it, man,
your homeland will be gone.

903
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,914
Everything you care about.

904
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:39,412
Save it.

905
01:11:39,504 --> 01:11:41,586
If you touch her,
I will fucking kill you.

906
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:43,913
Don't do this, Erik.

907
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:47,675
Killing Jean
will not bring Raven back.

908
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:51,128
The girl dies.

909
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:29,667
Kurt, I need you!

910
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,766
Kurt, get me inside.

911
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:41,850
You're not the only one
who can control minds.

912
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:42,976
Kurt!

913
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:40,659
They're coming to kill you.
You're not gonna let them.

914
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,365
You're gonna fight back.

915
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:56,011
Feel the power inside you.

916
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,180
The power is you.

917
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:31,664
Hold them!

918
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:47,892
I know whose blood that was.

919
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:54,441
You cast me out.

920
01:14:55,574 --> 01:14:57,235
Now you come here to kill me?

921
01:14:58,035 --> 01:14:59,946
That's right.

922
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:20,963
And you couldn't even do that.

923
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:28,220
Let me show you how.

924
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:07,973
Scott, a little help?

925
01:16:12,026 --> 01:16:13,687
Kurt!

926
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:15,143
Kurt! Kurt?

927
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:17,353
- You all right?
- No!

928
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:20,190
Come here!
Get me in that house now!

929
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:25,574
Have you come to kill me, too?

930
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:26,870
Never.

931
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:28,489
Jean, never!

932
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:31,451
I failed you.
I know that, but...

933
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:33,832
this isn't you.

934
01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:36,831
Kurt!

935
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:41,844
- Jean, please!
- You have no idea who I am.

936
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:44,138
I've raised you
since you were a little girl.

937
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:45,260
I think I do.

938
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:49,681
She's not your little girl anymore.

939
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:51,314
Who...

940
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:55,475
What are you?

941
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:01,773
Jean, please try and remember
what I taught you.

942
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:03,027
You can control it.

943
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:05,986
You can do anything
you set your mind to.

944
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,616
So show me.

945
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:11,657
Walk to me.

946
01:17:14,922 --> 01:17:15,922
You know I can't.

947
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:22,220
No!

948
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:32,640
Please, Jean.

949
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:42,772
Please.

950
01:17:57,715 --> 01:18:01,708
I can't see
in your mind anymore...

951
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:05,002
but you can see in mine.

952
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:08,468
So look.

953
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:11,634
Jean, look.

954
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:16,793
And what you choose
to do with your gift,

955
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:19,354
well, that's entirely up to you.

956
01:18:20,863 --> 01:18:22,524
This could be your new home.

957
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:25,690
We could be your new family.

958
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:28,244
No!

959
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:32,992
Because you are not broken.

960
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:43,340
Then you'll take her?

961
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:45,008
Yes.

962
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:48,181
No!

963
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:53,801
I can help her in ways
that you can't.

964
01:18:54,355 --> 01:18:56,141
She can't be helped.

965
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:58,389
She's a lost cause.

966
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:03,735
No, she's not.

967
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:06,154
As long as there's someone
to care for her, who believes,

968
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:07,322
then there's still hope.

969
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:13,863
Then there...

970
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:15,698
There's still hope.

971
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:33,428
I knew. I knew
you were still in there.

972
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:38,307
He just showed you your past.

973
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,479
Follow me...

974
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:45,686
into your future.

975
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:48,741
No.

976
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,840
Set weapons to neutralize.

977
01:19:57,293 --> 01:19:59,124
I never asked for this.

978
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:00,701
Any of it.

979
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:05,543
I traveled to the stars
for a gift that you don't want.

980
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:09,676
Then take it.

981
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:13,471
Please.

982
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:15,015
Free me.

983
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:19,554
I'll try.

984
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:08,693
Stop it.
You're going to kill her.

985
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:12,405
Your lives mean nothing.

986
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:16,702
Your world will be ours.

987
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:18,575
You'd kill us all.

988
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:20,496
Yes.

989
01:21:21,251 --> 01:21:22,661
Jean, you have to let go.

990
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:27,166
Jean, let go!

991
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:30,082
Let go, Jean. Let go!

992
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:34,503
Let go!

993
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:42,727
There's one! Get him!

994
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:46,943
Jean!

995
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:55,785
Jean.

996
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:57,575
Jean?

997
01:21:58,122 --> 01:21:59,783
Jean, Jean.

998
01:21:59,873 --> 01:22:02,353
- Charles, what's wrong?
- I don't know. I can't read her mind.

999
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:07,620
Come on, out!
Take him out!

1000
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:09,875
Come on, out, out!
You guys, come on. Train.

1001
01:22:09,967 --> 01:22:11,277
You four with me, let's go!

1002
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:12,404
- Let's go!
- Come on, move!

1003
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:13,884
Come on.
Move, move, move!

1004
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,438
- She's alive.
- Scott, you have to get her out.

1005
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:27,810
You have to... No!

1006
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:35,109
We're clear!

1007
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:58,545
Last one.

1008
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,232
We need a clean sweep
on the last three blocks.

1009
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:03,551
Let's go!

1010
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,906
My kid used to be a fan.

1011
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:33,247
Raven had the right of it.

1012
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:36,834
Jean was never the villain.

1013
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:41,301
I was.

1014
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:46,768
I should never have lied to her.

1015
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:50,439
I was wrong.

1016
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:55,903
But this power...

1017
01:23:57,074 --> 01:23:59,565
inside of her,
I never put that there.

1018
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,618
I would never do anything
intentionally to hurt her.

1019
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:06,617
That isn't me
and this is not Jean.

1020
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,620
We can still save her.

1021
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:12,202
She's still Jean inside.

1022
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:24,010
We're 10 miles out
from Mutant Containment Center.

1023
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:25,682
Prepare for prisoner transfer.

1024
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:38,362
What exactly is controlling her?

1025
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:39,563
I don't know.

1026
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:42,149
But this woman, this...

1027
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:43,484
thing...

1028
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:44,785
has had a taste of that power,

1029
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:46,099
and she'll be coming back for more.

1030
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:47,784
She'll be coming
back for Jean.

1031
01:24:47,874 --> 01:24:50,081
Good. Let her.

1032
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:52,534
She'll kill her to get it.

1033
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:55,416
But I promise you,
the killing will not end there.

1034
01:24:56,008 --> 01:24:58,044
That's not what Raven
would have wanted.

1035
01:24:58,135 --> 01:25:00,046
You know that.

1036
01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:02,169
You both do.

1037
01:25:21,325 --> 01:25:22,765
Skipper, are you seeing this?

1038
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:27,778
Alpha One, you have multiple
hostiles onboard.

1039
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:29,153
They're heading
towards the back.

1040
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:31,118
- Open four to five.
- Copy that.

1041
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:32,540
All right, you two,
come with me.

1042
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:34,744
The rest of you, stay here,
guard the prisoners!

1043
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:37,250
Don't be fools!
You need our help!

1044
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:39,127
Lock it down! Now!

1045
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:42,797
Goddamn muties
come to spring you.

1046
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:44,424
They're not mutants.

1047
01:25:44,514 --> 01:25:45,908
Free us, you're going
to need our help.

1048
01:25:45,932 --> 01:25:47,638
We're the only chance you have.

1049
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:49,011
Keep your mouth shut.

1050
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,288
Mayday! Mayday!

1051
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:33,055
What's the status
on those mutants?

1052
01:26:33,146 --> 01:26:35,512
We're falling back now! They're not...

1053
01:26:36,316 --> 01:26:37,931
What?

1054
01:26:38,485 --> 01:26:40,066
They're not what?

1055
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:42,940
- They're not mutants!
- They're here for Jean.

1056
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:46,364
Get ready to open fire!

1057
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:48,316
Your kid was right about us.

1058
01:26:48,412 --> 01:26:49,618
We could help you!

1059
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,840
Please!

1060
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:04,750
Fire!

1061
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:17,606
There's more!

1062
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:47,797
We only want the girl.
Step aside.

1063
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:48,923
No!

1064
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:51,383
What are you doing?

1065
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:54,341
What Raven would have.

1066
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:15,119
Scott, get me to Jean!

1067
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:56,236
Selene!

1068
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:00,626
Hank!

1069
01:29:02,045 --> 01:29:03,501
Help Storm!

1070
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:33,323
No, no, no, no, no, please.

1071
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:35,822
Don't die. No.

1072
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:30,943
That's it, that's it, that's it.

1073
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:33,670
Scott, guard the entrance.

1074
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:36,089
Jean, wake up.

1075
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:38,172
Jean, wake up.
You have to wake up now.

1076
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:56,040
Hank!

1077
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:54,357
I have no desire to fight you.

1078
01:32:54,986 --> 01:32:56,692
I get that a lot.

1079
01:32:57,489 --> 01:32:58,854
You wanted her dead.

1080
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:02,490
I had a change of heart.

1081
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:29,596
I was trying to protect you.

1082
01:33:29,687 --> 01:33:33,179
I was trying to keep
the pain away, but...

1083
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:34,980
You just buried it.

1084
01:33:36,736 --> 01:33:38,021
Jean.

1085
01:33:41,241 --> 01:33:42,356
Where...?

1086
01:33:44,828 --> 01:33:46,534
Are we inside my mind?

1087
01:33:48,123 --> 01:33:49,988
It's more peaceful than mine.

1088
01:33:54,212 --> 01:33:56,669
I'm so sorry
for what I did to you.

1089
01:33:57,382 --> 01:33:58,622
I know.

1090
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:01,674
All I ever wanted
was to protect you

1091
01:34:01,761 --> 01:34:03,592
and give you
what you deserved.

1092
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,966
What every child deserves.

1093
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:24,696
A family.

1094
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:26,702
Yeah.

1095
01:34:30,206 --> 01:34:32,242
I know you did what you did
out of love.

1096
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:34,707
I forgive you.

1097
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:56,805
I know what I need to do now.

1098
01:34:57,775 --> 01:34:59,356
And what is that?

1099
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:01,480
Protect my family.

1100
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:05,647
Jean. Jean.

1101
01:38:29,821 --> 01:38:31,277
You want this power?

1102
01:38:32,448 --> 01:38:34,530
You're gonna get it.

1103
01:38:47,463 --> 01:38:49,124
Aah! Jean!

1104
01:38:57,598 --> 01:39:00,340
You can't control it.

1105
01:39:01,144 --> 01:39:06,639
If you kill me,
you'll kill them all.

1106
01:39:23,541 --> 01:39:26,749
Your emotions make you weak.

1107
01:39:34,051 --> 01:39:35,166
Jean.

1108
01:39:36,179 --> 01:39:38,295
Enough.

1109
01:39:40,516 --> 01:39:41,516
Jean!

1110
01:39:52,445 --> 01:39:53,605
You're wrong.

1111
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:57,355
My emotions make me strong.

1112
01:40:48,376 --> 01:40:49,616
She's gone.

1113
01:41:00,846 --> 01:41:01,881
She...

1114
01:41:04,767 --> 01:41:06,598
She's free.

1115
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:52,057
I know who I am now.

1116
01:41:52,148 --> 01:41:55,982
I am not simply
what others want me to be.

1117
01:41:56,068 --> 01:42:00,186
I am not destined
to a fate I can't control.

1118
01:42:00,281 --> 01:42:02,738
I evolved beyond this world.

1119
01:42:04,076 --> 01:42:06,863
This is not the end of me...

1120
01:42:06,954 --> 01:42:08,319
or the X-Men.

1121
01:42:10,666 --> 01:42:12,281
It's a new beginning.

1122
01:42:16,172 --> 01:42:18,914
Hey, slow down. Safety first.

1123
01:43:22,905 --> 01:43:24,896
How's retirement treating you?

1124
01:43:25,574 --> 01:43:27,439
What are you doing here, Erik?

1125
01:43:27,535 --> 01:43:29,526
I came to see an old friend.

1126
01:43:31,247 --> 01:43:32,453
Fancy a game?

1127
01:43:35,376 --> 01:43:37,241
No, not today. Thank you.

1128
01:43:41,132 --> 01:43:44,340
A long time ago,
you saved my life.

1129
01:43:46,762 --> 01:43:48,969
Then you offered me a home.

1130
01:43:50,266 --> 01:43:52,632
I'd like to do the same for you.

1131
01:44:08,492 --> 01:44:10,198
Just one game.

1132
01:44:11,495 --> 01:44:12,985
For old times' sake.

1133
01:44:25,718 --> 01:44:27,424
I'll go easy on you.

1134
01:44:28,846 --> 01:44:30,177
No, you won't.
