1
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,125
Are you kidding me?

2
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,833
Rust Bank Brewery
is the heart of this town.

3
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,500
No deal, Mr. and Mrs. Klaxon.

4
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:45,875
-<i> Do you realize who I am?</i>
We are <i>not </i>selling the brewery.

5
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,416
Not to you or anyone else.

6
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,166
<i>Wait, wait!</i>
Got it?

7
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,416
You shut that down, Delroy?

8
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,083
It's over, Wilma.

9
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,625
I told him more beer, less prisons.

10
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:57,041
Whoo!

11
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,250
-Did real good here too!

12
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,708
I love that!

13
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,875
My library is set for the year.

14
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,958
-Time to go, Kat.
-Okay.

15
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,958
-Before you put Mr. Fawzi out of business.
-Daddy!

16
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,208
-Bye-bye, Kat!

17
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,583
What's that, Kat?

18
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,625
Uh… Uh, dessert!

19
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,166
No, honey, you'll pop.

20
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,833
Delroy, honey, pull over.
I don't like this.

21
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:40,375
W-We'll be fine, Wilma.

22
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,083
Look, almost home.

23
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:52,958
-What, baby?

24
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:54,333
Watch out!

25
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,375
No!

26
00:01:58,833 --> 00:01:59,666
Delroy!

27
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:01,500
Daddy!

28
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,916
-Kat, you need to swim like we taught you.
-No!

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,708
-Mama! Aren't you coming?
-Right behind you, baby!

30
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:08,958
Mama, I'm scared!

31
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,666
Now, listen to me, baby.

32
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,000
-You need to take a deep breath.

33
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,208
Now, go!

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,541
<i>One scream,</i>
<i>and my parents were gone.</i>

35
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:40,791
<i>Figured I'd just hate myself</i>
<i>for the rest of my life.</i>

36
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,500
<i>But… fate had other ideas.</i>

37
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,375
<i>They say everyone's got demons, right?</i>

38
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,875
<i>My demons have names.</i>

39
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,541
Soul Jockeys!
On the double!

40
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:08,291
Welcome to the scariest place
in the Underworld.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,666
I'm your host, Buffalo Belzer,

42
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,625
and this is the Scream Faire!

43
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,458
Yes!

44
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,208
Shocking!

45
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,375
Ooh, ouch.

46
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,916
Look at you go!

47
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,333
Ah!

48
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,166
Ah!

49
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:57,875
Okay.

50
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,833
Okay, that's it!
W-W-Wild, you're doin' it again!

51
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,625
-Doing what, Wendell?
-Stealin' the hair cream!

52
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,958
That's just a bad plug right there.
That's what that is.

53
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,791
-Why'd you plant it?
-It's not a bad plug.

54
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,000
You're depriving that plug
of its rightful nutrients.

55
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,083
Need I remind you?

56
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:19,625
It's your fault
Belzer put us in jail for treason!

57
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,000
And if he goes bald,

58
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,000
he'll skin us both alive!

59
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,125
Both?

60
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,958
I'm not worried, Wendell.
You're the one shootin' blanks.

61
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,625
-Get-- Get-- Hey!
-Oh!

62
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:34,000
As your older brother,
I demand you regurgitate that cream!

63
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,291
Now, why would I do that? Wendell…

64
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:41,625
fresh cream ain't gonna
revivify a bad plug.

65
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,458
Did you just admit
you've been stealing it?

66
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,958
-Uh-huh.
-Why?!

67
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,666
'Cause it tickles my tummy.

68
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,458
That's the dumbest thing I've…
What?

69
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:55,791
I'm gonna kill you!
I'mma throttle you from here to next Tue--

70
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,166
Oh, hey, you right!
That does feel kinda good.

71
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,416
-Yeah, and the best part…
-Oh?

72
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,000
Three, two, one,

73
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,791
and…

74
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,375
Ooh, yeah!

75
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,625
Yeah.

76
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,583
-Whoa.

77
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,208
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

78
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:24,875
I'm having a-- a vision, Wild!

79
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,833
A green-headed girl.

80
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,291
You see her too?

81
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,208
I do.

82
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:33,250
She seems so real!

83
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,750
Freaky!

84
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:35,791
Deaky!

85
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,708
Get up!

86
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:42,166
-My mutinous sons!

87
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,916
-And back to work!
-Whoa! Uh, whoa!

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,583
I felt her hand.

89
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,500
Me too!

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,083
<i>With my folks dead,</i>
<i>the next five years were hell.</i>

91
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,708
<i>Yeah, I got into a little trouble.</i>

92
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,375
<i>Okay, a lot of trouble.</i>

93
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,833
<i>But at 13,</i>

94
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:14,208
<i>I got a do-over</i>
<i>at this fancy girls' school, RBC.</i>

95
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,916
<i>Only problem…</i>

96
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,208
<i>…it was back in Rust Bank.</i>

97
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,375
You okay, Kat?

98
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:52,875
What?

99
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,125
The bridge. You had a panic attack.

100
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,750
I'm fine, Ms. Hunter.

101
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,708
Dad's brewery.

102
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,166
When did it burn down?

103
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,875
It was at your parents' memorial.

104
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,666
What?

105
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,458
You were already
in the group home upstate.

106
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,125
You didn't need more bad news.

107
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,208
Was anyone hurt?

108
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,708
It was bad.

109
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,000
<i>Home definitely wasn't</i>
<i>what it used to be.</i>

110
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,541
<i>Seems that brewery fire</i>
<i>had a domino effect,</i>

111
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,916
<i>and the whole town had died.</i>

112
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,458
What's this Klax Korp?

113
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,083
My old house!

114
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,208
<i>Good memories…</i>

115
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,125
<i>they can hurt the most.</i>

116
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,208
<i>But it wasn't just a do-over.</i>

117
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,916
<i>Something else up at that school</i>
<i>was pulling me back.</i>

118
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,750
<i>Something that knew what I was</i>

119
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,083
<i>before I did.</i>

120
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,375
Rust Bank Catholic.

121
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:22,958
Fancy!

122
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,625
Townies call it "Crust Stank."

123
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,291
Okay, townie.

124
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,083
What sort of girls go here?

125
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:36,333
Prize poodles. All Best in Show.

126
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,791
Whoa! It's Dad's Cyclops!

127
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,583
Some other stuff too.

128
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:47,583
Rust Bank Catholic was the first school
to sign up for "Break the Cycle."

129
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,750
I promised you would behave.

130
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,416
Yeah, well, I didn't.

131
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,000
Can you at least try?

132
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,916
I bet my grandma's
fry bread recipe on you.

133
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,333
What the… What?

134
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,916
So, you make this work!

135
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,166
-Huh?

136
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,333
-Pinch!
-Punch!

137
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,583
First of the month!

138
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,250
-Now you say…

139
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,583
-"A slap and a kick for being so quick."
-What?

140
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,083
Too slow!

141
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,125
No returns!

142
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,250
We are… Siobhan!

143
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,333
Sweetie!

144
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,250
Sloane!

145
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,666
-And this is Gabby Goat.

146
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,875
Welcome to…

147
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,291
RBC Girls!

148
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,291
Ugh.

149
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,333
-Don't be shy, Katherine Koniqua Elliot.
-It's Kat!

150
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,875
We've noodled up another idea.

151
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:36,958
It's the cutest!

152
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,833
Kay-Kay!

153
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,666
Ugh! No, thanks!

154
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,375
New name, new beginning!

155
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,833
It's your do-over, Kay-Kay.

156
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,500
-And we're going to help you heal.

157
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,166
There's holistic goat yoga each noon.

158
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,625
Feed your soul, not your waistline.

159
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,333
Evenings, we meditate for the environment.

160
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,750
The earth resonates beneath our bums.

161
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,125
And best of all…

162
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:02,333
Our "Fashion for World Peace" event!

163
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,833
Who knows?
"Prison Chic" could be the next big thing.

164
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,666
Now, let's get you moved in.

165
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,208
Hey, don't touch!

166
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,583
-What is it?
-It's vintage.

167
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:12,916
Touched it!

168
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,708
-What the--

169
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,750
Hey, you!

170
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,250
Did you see what she did?

171
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,708
Kay-Kay just saved my life!

172
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,208
Ah!

173
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,083
Let go of me!

174
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:40,125
-This way, Miss Elliot.
-Headmaster's waiting.

175
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,833
What's going on, Siobhan?

176
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,500
How did she see it coming?

177
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,083
I don't know.

178
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,875
But I have a feeling Kay-Kay's
the best thing to happen here

179
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,166
in a long time.

180
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:00,375
My door is always open!

181
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,333
Ah! Welcome home, Miss Elliot,

182
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,000
to Rust Bank.

183
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:11,791
Ah?

184
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,208
-Whoa!

185
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,916
Oh, ow.

186
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,416
-Ooh!

187
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,500
And welcome to RBC Girls!

188
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,208
I am Father Level Bests.

189
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,750
And now, you're gonna kick me out.

190
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,166
Oh, no!

191
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,166
You just arrived, Miss Elliot.

192
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,291
But you shoulda broke your back.

193
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,375
I--

194
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,791
Uh, God willing,
we're going to break the cycle.

195
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,583
A second chance for girls like you. Yeah.

196
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:52,583
This school's in trouble, isn't it?
You need that "Break the Cycle" money.

197
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:56,375
Ah, and you… You need a fresh start.

198
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,625
I told them,
bring this damaged child home.

199
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:04,000
Surround her with the best and brightest,
and Katherine Koniqua Elliot--

200
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,000
It's Kat!

201
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,250
…will flourish.

202
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,500
Ugh.

203
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,666
You're an RBC Girl now.

204
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,125
-Huh?

205
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,791
A-ha. The Klaxons.

206
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,833
Do not dawdle.

207
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,083
Whoa.

208
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,541
Kay-Kay?

209
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,416
-Huh.

210
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,708
You're the assassin!

211
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,208
No, that brick was loose.

212
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,375
Eyes ahead. You're drawing attention.

213
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,916
-Thank God you saved her.
-I didn't.

214
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,583
-She got lucky.
-She, uh…

215
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,083
We used to be friends.

216
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,791
You liked that prize poodle?

217
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,208
Yeah.

218
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,000
Why were you up that tower?

219
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,750
It's an art project
for when the snow melts.

220
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,541
I'm Raúl.

221
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,708
I don't do friends, Raúl.

222
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,708
Bad things happen to people I'm close to.

223
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,083
Like what?

224
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,041
They die.

225
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,541
Whoa.

226
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:37,833
Traitor.

227
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,166
Sorry I'm late.

228
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,125
Adaptable nature.

229
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:52,500
Ha!

230
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:57,416
Now, this spectacular creature
is called <i>Thaumoctopus mimicus,</i>

231
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,083
the mimic octopus.

232
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:06,750
It's the only creature that can change
its body shape to fool predators and prey.

233
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,666
Holy biscuits!

234
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,750
Ooh!

235
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:16,625
Wow!

236
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,291
Oh, my!

237
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,166
That's amazing.

238
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,416
Now, you look like an adaptable girl.

239
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,541
It's Kat.

240
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:30,958
Well, come on up, Kat.
Get a close-up of this marvelous mollusk!

241
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,041
Kay-Kay!

242
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,291
-Oh, no!
-What's happening?

243
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,916
-Gabby!

244
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,000
-Ahh!

245
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,041
Okay.

246
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,958
Slow, deep breaths, Kat.

247
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,166
Um, let's take a look.

248
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,500
-Oh!

249
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,333
What's-- What's on my hand?

250
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:22,208
Ah, okay.
You've never seen this before, right?

251
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,291
Never.

252
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:28,291
Uh, well, the mark proves
that you're special, Kat.

253
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,458
But it has to be our secret.

254
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,583
Huh?

255
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,875
-That's how I can protect you.
-Protect me from what?

256
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,958
That stupid octopus. It bit me, right?

257
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:42,000
-It wasn't the octopus.
-You're just protecting your job!

258
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,916
Tell no one, Kat!

259
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,750
So, what do we believe
just happened? Sweetie?

260
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,000
Kay-Kay is a sorceress!

261
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:58,458
No, she's clearly telekinetic.
Her mind can move matter.

262
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:02,208
Well, I would posit
that Kay-Kay is an interrupter.

263
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,500
A disturber of the status quo.

264
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:07,583
Oh, come on, Siobhan, leave her alone.

265
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,041
It's none of your business, Ramona.

266
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:14,416
-I'm sorry, Raúl. I keep forgetting.

267
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:19,708
Look at it.

268
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:23,583
Our faire is so much better
than Belzer's dump!

269
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,916
But you couldn't keep your mouth shut.

270
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,625
I know.

271
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,583
I was braggin' to the wrong demon.

272
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,291
Duh! When Belzer found out,

273
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,250
he called this an insurrection,
a rebellion!

274
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,541
Now, we're stuck here for life!

275
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,625
Guess we got what we deserve.

276
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:45,875
"We"?! You have not begun
to get what you deserve.

277
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,708
-Whoa.
-It's a bearzabubble!

278
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,666
From the Land of the Living!

279
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,666
<i>Good news, cousins!</i>

280
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,666
<i>You've got a Hell Maiden!</i>

281
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,666
That's the girl in our vision!

282
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,958
Same one!

283
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,916
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>I've marked her hand so you'll know.</i>

284
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,041
Marked her hand?

285
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,500
<i>Rejoice!</i>

286
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,708
<i>It's a new day in your miserable lives.</i>

287
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,458
Hell Maidens are real, Wild.

288
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,958
Imagine! She could summon us
to the Land of the Living!

289
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:41,708
But-- But demons aren't allowed up there.
I mean, Belzer claims it's dangerous.

290
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:45,166
Dangerous? Wild, he never even been there.

291
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,333
Then that's where we'll build our faire!

292
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,416
What?!

293
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,750
That's amazing, Wild. You're right!
He would never know.

294
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,208
-Stick it to the man!

295
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,916
Shh! Not so loud.
We're right under his nose!

296
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,500
So what do we do now?

297
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,500
Think it's time to see our Hell Maiden.
Got any spare hair cream?

298
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:10,666
Let the re-visioning begin.

299
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,666
Look at them.

300
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,958
Bloody council members
in their tiny houses.

301
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,041
<i>They blocked our prison before, Lane…</i>

302
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:27,291
and I'll blow beets
if they block us again!

303
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,375
I'm not optimistic, Irmgard.

304
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,833
Can't bribe them,
and they're-- they're too clever to be…

305
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,666
"…retired."

306
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,500
Well, I have good news.

307
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,333
We have a new girl at RBC.

308
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,500
Full tuition!

309
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:51,375
Sweet Siobhan told Mummy all about her.

310
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:54,875
Now the state's paying <i>him</i>
to take in criminals.

311
00:21:55,458 --> 00:22:00,583
That's our business model, Bests.
How dare you compete with Klax Korp!

312
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:06,041
Well, technically,
it's not competing if you have no prison.

313
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,250
-He's right, Lane.

314
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:11,583
We need our own council members
to win the vote.

315
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:15,916
Oh, yes, uh, the old-guard members.
They would vote for you!

316
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,916
Ooh! Where do we find them, Father?

317
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,500
In the finest mausoleums in the cemetery.

318
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,125
They're dead?!

319
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,583
It's over, Bests.

320
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:32,333
We are no longer going to
prop you and your precious RBC up.

321
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:36,083
Irmgard, Lane, I vouched for you
the night of the brewery fire.

322
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:38,458
Indeed.

323
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,250
Pop his clogs.

324
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:42,625
What's that, then?

325
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:56,750
Drowning is so peaceful.

326
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,458
Indeed, sweet Irmgard.

327
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,750
Really, Raúl, your art project, now?

328
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:15,041
It's the final part of the mural, Mami.

329
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:20,000
-Hi, Irwin. <i>¿Que pasa?</i>

330
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:22,333
What do you mean,
"alleviate the situation?"

331
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:25,666
-But I am your top-earning paralegal.

332
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,375
My success rate is higher
than anyone on staff.

333
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:35,125
But you know that I'm fighting
to keep my house, right?

334
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,916
What am I supposed to do now?
I have a son to feed.

335
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:41,583
No! A son, remember?

336
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,041
Yes.

337
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,541
I'm still investigating the fire.

338
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,541
Look, Win, those workers were my friends,

339
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:50,500
my neighbors.

340
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:54,000
I-- I know the Klaxons are dangerous.

341
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:58,333
But if I can link them to the fire,
we can stop the prison for good.

342
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,625
-All I need is an eye wit--

343
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:02,666
Oh, so that's it? We're done?

344
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,541
Don't you dare hang up on me!

345
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:07,916
Coward!

346
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,416
I really, really need to talk to you.

347
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,708
Look, almost home.

348
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,500
-What, baby?

349
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:43,416
Watch out!

350
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,916
-No!

351
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,250
-Delroy!

352
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:48,500
Listen, listen to me, Kat.

353
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:51,583
You need to swim like we taught you.
All the way up.

354
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:53,791
-Aren't you coming?
-Right behind you, baby!

355
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:55,000
Mama, I'm scared!

356
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:58,875
Now, listen to me, baby.
You need to take a deep breath.

357
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Now, go!

358
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:35,875
Who are you?
What are you doing in my dream?

359
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:37,666
Greetings, Hell Maiden!

360
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,750
Me?

361
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:40,916
Uh…
You-- You've got the mark, right?

362
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,833
<i>Tell no one, Kat!</i>

363
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:45,625
What mark? I don't have a mark.

364
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:46,791
Sure, you do.

365
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,583
It's right there.

366
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:50,208
Hey!

367
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:52,208
-What do you want?

368
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:54,750
We are Wendell and Wild.

369
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:57,500
-Your personal demons.
-Who?

370
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,583
Well, you can summon us
to the Land of the Living.

371
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:02,416
-Why would I do that?
-'Cause we'll give you whatever you want.

372
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,958
Huh. Only thing I want is my parents.

373
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:08,166
And they're dead.

374
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,166
Uh-huh. Conference.

375
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:13,916
-We can't raise the dead.
-Well, we do know how to lie.

376
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,750
Oh! I like that plan.

377
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:19,250
-No problemo!
-That's right! You do your bit…

378
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,333
And we'll bring 'em back alive.

379
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:23,125
That's ridiculous.

380
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:25,333
-Well, I mean--
-What do you got to lose?

381
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,958
Fine. So what do I do?

382
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:35,083
-Okay, now, first, find Bearz-a-bub.
-What's a Bearz-a-bub?

383
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:38,041
Finds Hell Maidens for demons.
Found you for us.

384
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:40,375
-Well, it marked your hand so we'd know.
-Then what?

385
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:44,000
Then, you take it
to the grave site next full moon.

386
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:47,083
-It'll tell you what to do.
-Oh, yeah, one more thing!

387
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:49,333
You gotta have a witness!

388
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:02,041
Bearz-a-bub.

389
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:25,458
Bearz-a-bub?

390
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,083
<i>Thief!</i>

391
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,416
Sister…

392
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,125
Helley is a…

393
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:04,916
thief!

394
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,208
-Huh?
-Eh?

395
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:10,208
Come back here, spy!

396
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:14,208
-Hmm?

397
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:21,791
Oh, Helley.

398
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:24,416
You should have returned it.

399
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:28,333
Now, we'll both be in the dark.

400
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:37,250
Wakey-wakey, souls of the danged!

401
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:42,000
It's your Scream Faire Daddy! Say my name!

402
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:44,291
Belzer!

403
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:45,416
Say my name!

404
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,791
Belzer!

405
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:49,791
Say my name!

406
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:51,708
Belzer!

407
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:58,250
Jeez! Can-- Can you believe
that vainglorious blowhard?

408
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,500
It's love him, can't leave him.

409
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:03,125
Danged souls <i>have</i> to praise him!

410
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:06,666
At our faire, folks'll be lined up
wantin' to get in!

411
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,583
Indeed!

412
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,041
Only, how are we gonna pay for it?

413
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,458
I know how.

414
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:12,666
Yes, Wild?

415
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,208
Remember that rich soul
of the danged?

416
00:32:15,291 --> 00:32:17,000
What, the-- the Nigerian Prince?

417
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:20,333
Yeah. He said
if we helped him escape, he'd--

418
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:23,250
That's nothing but a scam, Wild!

419
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:25,250
That's sound financial planning!

420
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:28,541
How 'bout I snap your horns off,
rub 'em together, and make a fire?

421
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,291
Ugh! Disgusting!

422
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,500
Huh?

423
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:46,208
Stop the cart. Stop the cart!

424
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:49,250
-All right, okay!

425
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:51,791
That tick was dead.

426
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:55,666
Why you messin' with me, Wild?
We got a serious problem to solve,

427
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,166
and-- and you up here talkin'--

428
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:10,208
Do it again!

429
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:16,458
Whoa!

430
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:18,458
See, Wendell?

431
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:22,416
I bet folks would pay a lot
to come back from the dead, right?

432
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:25,916
Yeah, sure, only that was just a tick.

433
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
We need to test the cream
on something bigger.

434
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,375
Hey, Spark Plug…

435
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:45,500
Uh, what if we can't
bring him back to life?

436
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:47,250
I couldn't live with myself.

437
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:49,541
Me neither.

438
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:55,375
Look, a full moon'll be rising soon!

439
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:58,625
Got our very own Hell Maiden
to summon us up!

440
00:33:58,708 --> 00:34:01,166
We'll dig up her parents
and test the cream!

441
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,166
And if it works?

442
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:06,291
There'll be plenty of dough
to build our faire!

443
00:34:06,791 --> 00:34:09,416
Oh! Gonna need transportation funds.

444
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:24,125
…we commend our brother…

445
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,250
A full moon.

446
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:26,500
Kay-Kay, sometimes it's harder
to let go when you've just met.

447
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:27,791
No, it's not.

448
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,750
Father Bests saved your life.

449
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:32,500
Maybe he was just trying
to save the school.

450
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:37,041
Kay-Kay, it's customary to cast
one's carnation on the lowering coffin.

451
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:39,833
Not Kay-Kay! Not my custom.

452
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,208
Time to say goodbye, Kay-Kay.

453
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:43,750
Fine!

454
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:46,541
Goodbye!

455
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:47,666
-Oh!
-Aw!

456
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:52,333
-You're comin' with me.
-What for?

457
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,375
I need a witness, and you're it.

458
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:04,291
Why do those poodles
keep bothering me?

459
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:06,250
They want you to be like them.

460
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,791
Heh.

461
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,625
Uh…

462
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:12,833
Wow, you were a poodle too.

463
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:16,041
I… I tried to be but…

464
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,041
You're not nearly as annoying.

465
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:23,333
Siobhan's okay, considering her parents.

466
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:24,458
Her parents?

467
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:26,750
The Klaxons. Klax Korp?

468
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:28,750
She's a Klaxon?

469
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,083
There we go.

470
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:41,625
And… boom, done, okay.

471
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:43,708
Oh, gosh! Did I make
a sculpture or a mirror?

472
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:45,750
You know what I'm sayin'?

473
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:49,583
Oh. Nope. That's not gonna work.

474
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:52,041
Well, there we go.

475
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:57,000
I'm doin' somethin'--
I'm doin' somethin' important.

476
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:03,625
Come on, Hell Maiden, summon us up!

477
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:14,750
Ms. Hunter said it was bad.

478
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:24,666
Come on.

479
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:29,125
My mother thinks the fire was on purpose.

480
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:31,458
Needs a witness to prove it.

481
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,333
Hmm.

482
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:47,333
Your parents?

483
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:49,166
Mm-hmm.

484
00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:59,625
You're, uh, gonna make a shrine?

485
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:00,541
Nope.

486
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:03,791
Okay, now, tell me what to do.

487
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:05,166
About what?

488
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,708
Not you, Raúl, the bear.

489
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:11,875
Ah!

490
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:21,666
<i>Hand me to the Hell Maiden.</i>

491
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,750
Hell Maiden?

492
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,666
Kat.

493
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,166
<i>Good. Now, repeat after me.</i>

494
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,541
What's going on, Kat?

495
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:32,208
Look, I made a deal.
I'm bringing my parents back.

496
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:33,583
What?

497
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:34,500
Shush!

498
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:39,041
<i>Per Virginem</i>
<i>facultates, infernum…</i>

499
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:43,583
Per Virginem facultates, infernum…

500
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:46,541
<i>…aperire portas…</i>

501
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:49,291
…aperire portas…

502
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:54,166
<i>…ut redeat</i>
<i>daemones parentibus.</i>

503
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:58,791
…ut redeat daemones parentibus.

504
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:13,625
I've got the cream here.
I'm gonna put this…

505
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:25,041
It's the summoning!

506
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:27,958
-The summoning!
-The summoning spell!

507
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:29,791
-The summoning spell!

508
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:33,625
Let's go!

509
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:36,083
Flap it! Flap it! Flap it! Flap it!

510
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,083
-Flap it! Flap it!
-Here we go!

511
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:39,875
Attaboy, Sparky.
Attaboy, Sparky.

512
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:41,666
-Shhh…

513
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,333
Easy, Sparky, easy. Here we go…

514
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:46,125
Way to go, Soul Jockeys!

515
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:49,166
-Whoa!

516
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,875
Oh!

517
00:39:59,791 --> 00:40:01,625
Go back to sleep,
go back to sleep!

518
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:05,000
Ooh, that was close!

519
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,166
What?

520
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,125
Yes!

521
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,083
-Hi-ho, Hell Maiden!

522
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:40,916
We're here!

523
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,541
-Whoo!

524
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,083
Um… Yoo-hoo?

525
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:52,083
Don't be shy, now!

526
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:56,291
No, no, please!

527
00:40:57,375 --> 00:40:58,458
Come on!

528
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:01,666
Say something! Tell me what to do! Please!

529
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:07,875
They lied to me!

530
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:30,250
Well…

531
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:32,750
Hi, Sister Helley.

532
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:34,500
Why weren't you two on the bus?

533
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:38,291
-Uh, Kat needed me to be a witness?
-It's my fault.

534
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:41,333
Didn't want to see
my parents' grave alone.

535
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:42,958
I see.

536
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:48,291
Well, we have a long, cold walk back.

537
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:52,833
Eh, she'll show up at some point.

538
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:54,750
Meanwhile…

539
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:56,833
I say it's time to test the cream!

540
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,625
Look, a fresh-dug grave!

541
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:05,416
-Time to eat dirt, Sparky!

542
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:16,291
-Here we go.

543
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:23,708
Ooh, that is one
messed-up man of the cloth.

544
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:28,041
Sure, but if we can raise him up,
we can raise up anyone in the cemetery.

545
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,500
-Wendell?
-Mm-hmm?

546
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:41,791
It's not working.

547
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,416
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

548
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,208
-It worked!
-Whoo!

549
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,875
-Who did it?
-We did it!

550
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:57,875
Dear God! I'm in Hell!

551
00:42:57,958 --> 00:42:59,375
No way, Padre!

552
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:02,208
You're back
in good ol' Rust Bank, fully alive!

553
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:06,000
Thank you, Lord, for this miracle!

554
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,000
Not Him! We brought you back!

555
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:09,500
-What?
-Wendell and Wild!

556
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:11,958
You? But you're demons.

557
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:15,916
Don't worry, Padre.
We are the Magician Morticians.

558
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,208
The <i>artistes</i> of the afterlife.

559
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:25,166
-Okay.

560
00:43:28,791 --> 00:43:29,625
And…

561
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:31,625
Ta-da!

562
00:43:32,916 --> 00:43:35,875
Y-Y-Your work is remarkable!

563
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:39,958
Now, as far as payment goes…

564
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,125
Um, uh, I have to pay you?

565
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:43,541
How much?

566
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:45,000
Everything you've got.

567
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:48,000
Yeah, we're gonna build
the best bemusement park ever!

568
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:51,250
-We're gonna call it the Dream Faire!
-Huh?

569
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:54,625
And you, and all your neighbors
around here, gonna pay for it.

570
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:59,375
I-- I-- I need to show you something.

571
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:01,083
-Huh?
-Come.

572
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:08,125
This… is Rust Bank.

573
00:44:08,916 --> 00:44:09,875
Take a look.

574
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:13,750
No jobs.

575
00:44:14,958 --> 00:44:15,958
No banks.

576
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,916
No people.

577
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:20,958
Go ahead,

578
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:23,541
raise all the dead you want,

579
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:26,916
but there's no one here
to pay for this faire.

580
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:40,000
What's to stop us from puttin'
your janky ass back in the ground?

581
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:43,916
Yeah, your janky, stanky ass.

582
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:47,041
He's right, Lane.

583
00:44:47,125 --> 00:44:50,416
We need our own council members
to win the vote.

584
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,208
Oh, yes, uh, the old-guard members.

585
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:55,000
They would vote for you!

586
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:57,500
W-W-Wait! Wait.

587
00:44:57,583 --> 00:44:59,083
I just had a vision.

588
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:03,791
Uh, uh, the Klaxons, uh, would
gladly pay for your services.

589
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:06,916
-Enough to build our Dream Faire?
-With all the trimmings?

590
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,791
Uh-huh. All that,
and enough to save my school.

591
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,458
Well, here we are, Kat.

592
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:23,583
Just tell me one thing before you go.

593
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:25,958
Is our secret safe?

594
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:32,375
I know what you are, Kat.
You're a Hell Maiden.

595
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:34,416
But how could you know that?

596
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,166
I'm… kind of an expert.

597
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:41,916
And you do not want
certain parties finding out about you.

598
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:44,333
Why do you care about me?

599
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:47,875
I care because I was just like you.

600
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:50,166
Oh, so you were stupid too!

601
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:54,041
-You aren't stupid, Kat.
-Stupid enough to get my parents killed!

602
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:56,125
Stupid enough to just watch 'em drown,

603
00:45:56,208 --> 00:45:59,333
not even try to help!
Stupid enough to believe they could ever--

604
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:02,291
Stop! It couldn't have
all been your fault, Kat.

605
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:04,416
You're nothing like me!

606
00:46:15,458 --> 00:46:18,833
We were so worried, Kay-Kay,
when you didn't get on the bus.

607
00:46:18,916 --> 00:46:21,541
-Where were you?
-You gonna arrest me, Klax Korp?

608
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:24,541
-Arrest you?
-You <i>are</i> the prison people.

609
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:26,958
Why, yes, private prisons.

610
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:30,375
With trauma therapy,
full detox, and whole-being cleanses.

611
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:32,500
You ever been inside a private prison?

612
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,958
Well, no.

613
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:41,125
I didn't think so.

614
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:49,250
It's the cutest.

615
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:50,750
That dream you had…

616
00:46:53,625 --> 00:46:57,041
Maybe it was just some students
messing with you.

617
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:59,791
I said they were demons, Raúl!

618
00:46:59,875 --> 00:47:02,750
My personal demons. And they lied!

619
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,250
Hmm. Maybe demons aren't
the most trustworthy creatures

620
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:07,375
to make a deal with.

621
00:47:09,916 --> 00:47:12,083
-<i>Good morning, RBC!</i>

622
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:14,833
<i>It's your very own Father Bests.</i>

623
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:19,416
<i>Reports of my death</i>
<i>were greatly exaggerated.</i>

624
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,750
What?!

625
00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:22,833
<i>So, I am back on the job,</i>

626
00:47:22,916 --> 00:47:27,458
<i>guiding this glorious institution</i>
<i>into the future.</i>

627
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:30,708
It's dear Father Bests!

628
00:47:30,791 --> 00:47:31,916
-Alive!
-Oh, my God!

629
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,500
All right, everyone!

630
00:47:33,583 --> 00:47:36,958
-Everyone, okay. Please, stay calm!

631
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:39,750
-Just--
-It's got to be a miracle, right?

632
00:47:41,666 --> 00:47:43,833
-Whoo!

633
00:47:50,666 --> 00:47:51,958
-Come on!

634
00:47:53,541 --> 00:47:54,375
Kay-Kay?

635
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:04,291
They were supposed
to bring my parents back, not you!

636
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:08,166
Oh, uh, my-my… Oh, my!

637
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:10,083
Really, Miss Elliot?

638
00:48:10,166 --> 00:48:11,083
Ugh!

639
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:14,250
Perhaps, I'm just more important

640
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:17,000
than your parents.

641
00:48:17,083 --> 00:48:20,666
Oh, you creepy old dude!

642
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:24,083
Forgive me, Father,
but you wouldn't even be here without Kat.

643
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:27,041
How is that, exactly?

644
00:48:27,125 --> 00:48:28,833
She's the one who summoned those demons--

645
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:30,333
-Shh!
-Ow!

646
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:33,708
Well, if you can't explain yourselves,

647
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,875
I have better things to do.

648
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:40,250
Code seven, code seven!

649
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:42,333
Hostage situation in the headmaster's--

650
00:48:42,416 --> 00:48:44,500
-What?!
-Penguins deploy!

651
00:48:44,583 --> 00:48:47,000
We're not holding you hostage.

652
00:48:47,083 --> 00:48:50,000
Uh, children, life is precious.

653
00:48:50,583 --> 00:48:53,208
Right now, you're wasting mine.

654
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:55,208
-Girlie, move it!

655
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:08,500
What the bloody hell?

656
00:49:09,166 --> 00:49:10,333
Bests' phone!

657
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:20,375
Father Bests, undead.

658
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,833
-Hmm.
-How's it possible, Manberg?

659
00:49:24,666 --> 00:49:26,916
Remember your first demon, Helley?

660
00:49:27,416 --> 00:49:30,250
You were just 12 when we captured it.

661
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:32,791
Yes, made me summon demons,

662
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:35,916
just so you could add them
to your stupid collection.

663
00:49:36,458 --> 00:49:41,416
I made you my right foot of justice,
and you quit on me!

664
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,500
It had nothing to do with justice!

665
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:45,041
It was entrapment.

666
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:46,791
It was wrong.

667
00:49:56,583 --> 00:50:00,041
There's a new Hell Maiden
at RBC, isn't there?

668
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:03,208
She's… She's safe!

669
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:06,166
My bear would've told me she'd arrived,

670
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:09,041
given me time to train and protect her.

671
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:11,500
But you stole it from me.

672
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:15,625
And the new Hell Maiden
has stolen it from you.

673
00:50:24,041 --> 00:50:25,916
I'll be waiting, Helley.

674
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:00,708
Uh…

675
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:03,458
Hmm.

676
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:18,916
-No laughing.
-Back to work!

677
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:43,458
Manberg was right.

678
00:51:51,166 --> 00:51:52,000
Finally.

679
00:51:56,166 --> 00:51:58,666
Sister Daley!
Sister Chinstrap!

680
00:52:03,083 --> 00:52:04,541
Come on, wake up!

681
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:08,916
You're going alone?

682
00:52:09,708 --> 00:52:10,875
They're demons!

683
00:52:10,958 --> 00:52:13,166
My demons, Raúl, my problem.

684
00:52:15,541 --> 00:52:16,750
Open the door.

685
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,291
-It's an emergency!
-Oh!

686
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:21,125
-Chinstrap!
-Oh!

687
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:22,166
-Wake up!
-Ooh!

688
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:27,375
Now, where are Kat and Raúl?

689
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:40,500
Kat!

690
00:52:41,916 --> 00:52:43,416
Raúl!

691
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,750
It sounded just like him on the phone.

692
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:50,250
It couldn't have been.

693
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,000
We drowned him right here.

694
00:52:57,458 --> 00:53:00,416
-You're supposed to be dead!
-You look bloody hideous!

695
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,000
I like my new look.

696
00:53:03,375 --> 00:53:05,041
-Get him, Lane!

697
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:07,583
-Come here, you little…

698
00:53:07,666 --> 00:53:08,500
-Oh!

699
00:53:08,583 --> 00:53:10,791
Gonna pop your clogs permanently!

700
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:14,458
Wait! I-I-I can get you the votes!

701
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:16,791
-Ah!
-For our new prison?

702
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:18,708
-How?

703
00:53:18,791 --> 00:53:20,416
The council votes tomorrow!

704
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:23,500
These are my partners,

705
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,375
Wendell and Wild.

706
00:53:27,041 --> 00:53:29,208
Um, we raised Padre, here.

707
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:30,166
From the dead.

708
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:35,083
Now, they can raise
the old-guard members you need.

709
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:37,708
The ones rotting in the cemetery?

710
00:53:37,791 --> 00:53:40,333
Sure! Have 'em all cleaned up,
ready to vote by morning.

711
00:53:40,916 --> 00:53:43,541
-Yes!

712
00:53:43,625 --> 00:53:45,166
Get those prison votes,

713
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:47,833
and we'll make you rich.

714
00:53:47,916 --> 00:53:50,708
Rich enough to build our Dream Faire?

715
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:51,708
Certainly!

716
00:53:51,791 --> 00:53:54,250
We'll pull the permits,
fast-track construction--

717
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:55,500
And Bob's your uncle!

718
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:59,000
What about my school?

719
00:53:59,083 --> 00:54:00,500
Of course, Father.

720
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:04,250
RBC shall have
our full financial support now!

721
00:54:06,416 --> 00:54:07,625
Mmm.

722
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:12,333
Those brewery workers are
in the same cemetery.

723
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,291
Gah!

724
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:18,375
By the way, do you plan to raise
anyone else from the dead?

725
00:54:18,458 --> 00:54:21,083
Well, uh, our Hell Maiden's parents--

726
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:23,833
No, no! No, no, no, no, no!

727
00:54:23,916 --> 00:54:26,666
If you raise anyone else in the cemetery--

728
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:30,750
It's no funfair, no RBC money!

729
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:33,250
-What? Hey, wait a minute--
-I promise!

730
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:36,458
Just your voters
will be raised.

731
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:39,875
Fine. Toodle-pip!

732
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,500
Well, there they are, Wild.

733
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:50,291
The old-guard graves?

734
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:53,583
Exactly. All parked in a row.

735
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:54,916
How convenient!

736
00:54:56,083 --> 00:54:57,416
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

737
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,291
-What's wrong, boy?

738
00:55:02,041 --> 00:55:03,083
Ow!

739
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:04,583
Where were you?

740
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:06,500
Hell Maiden!

741
00:55:06,583 --> 00:55:07,625
Stop! Stop it!

742
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:09,666
You promised my parents!

743
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:11,208
Ch-- Wha-- You weren't here!

744
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:15,500
Yeah, you weren't up in here.
So, we-- we made Bests our guinea pig.

745
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:16,958
-Uh-huh.
-Check this out.

746
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,125
Ooh! What's that?

747
00:55:20,208 --> 00:55:21,708
Oh, that's our secret sauce.

748
00:55:21,791 --> 00:55:23,458
That stuff'll bring my parents back?

749
00:55:23,541 --> 00:55:25,125
-Yep.
-Um…

750
00:55:25,208 --> 00:55:27,041
Great! Let's go!

751
00:55:27,875 --> 00:55:30,750
Klaxon said game over
if we raise anyone else!

752
00:55:30,833 --> 00:55:33,291
-Ho-Ho-Ho-Hold on, now! Hold on.
-Not just yet! See…

753
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,916
That-- That-- That's not
how it works… anymore.

754
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:39,458
-Mmm.
-Well, first, you got to… to…

755
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:41,333
-To swear allegiance.

756
00:55:41,416 --> 00:55:43,625
-That's right!
-That wasn't the deal!

757
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:47,875
Hell Maiden,
do you promise to serve us…

758
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:53,125
For all eternity!

759
00:55:53,208 --> 00:55:55,583
-You've gotta be kidding me.
-Stop, Kat!

760
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:56,916
-Stop!

761
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,791
-Leave it, Raúl!

762
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:02,041
-The heck is he doin' up there?

763
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:03,791
Fine.

764
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:05,916
I…

765
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,416
swear it.

766
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:15,375
What'd you do, Wild?

767
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:17,625
Wasn't me, Wendell. Skull mouth did it.

768
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,208
Huh.

769
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:20,583
Uh…

770
00:56:21,083 --> 00:56:23,708
Uh, for your first task…

771
00:56:23,791 --> 00:56:26,958
I know! Get us some take-out.
We're starving!

772
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:30,333
Only place left
is… Fawzi's Falafel.

773
00:56:30,416 --> 00:56:31,333
I'll help.

774
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:32,541
Oh, no.

775
00:56:32,625 --> 00:56:35,000
You and Sparky got graves to dig.

776
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:38,625
Warned you, Raúl,
bad things happen to people I'm close to.

777
00:56:44,541 --> 00:56:46,625
Come on, we haven't got all night.

778
00:56:58,250 --> 00:56:59,083
One…

779
00:57:01,291 --> 00:57:04,458
…two, three, four, five…

780
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:09,041
-Six.

781
00:57:10,875 --> 00:57:13,333
-Ahh!

782
00:57:13,416 --> 00:57:16,291
-Here we go!

783
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:26,666
-Welcome back!

784
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:28,333
-Good to see you!

785
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:42,916
Makeover time, let's go!

786
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,291
Makeover time!

787
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:50,000
Hello!

788
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:55,458
Come on out.

789
00:57:59,625 --> 00:58:02,250
-Remember, vote pro-prison!

790
00:58:09,291 --> 00:58:10,250
Woo-hoo!

791
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:14,083
-Whoa, that group was challenging!
-Little dab to celebrate?

792
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:17,541
-What are you doing?

793
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:19,000
Ticklin' our tummies.

794
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:21,625
Hey, we earned it.

795
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:22,541
Stop!

796
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,833
There won't be any left for Kat's parents!

797
00:58:25,916 --> 00:58:29,875
I love
that little Hell Maiden, but…

798
00:58:29,958 --> 00:58:32,208
If we raise her parents,

799
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:34,833
the Klaxons won't build our Dream Faire.

800
00:58:34,916 --> 00:58:35,750
Mm-hmm.

801
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,750
I am so happy you're back, Kat!

802
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:10,208
Rust Bank needs some bright colors.

803
00:59:10,791 --> 00:59:13,000
Smells so good, Mr. Fawzi.

804
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:15,333
You want the hot sauce, right?

805
00:59:15,916 --> 00:59:18,125
-Yeah.
-Take the whole bottle.

806
00:59:19,666 --> 00:59:22,250
-And hey, don't be a stranger, hmm?
-Thanks.

807
00:59:28,625 --> 00:59:29,500
Okay.

808
00:59:58,666 --> 00:59:59,750
Delroy.

809
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:00,666
Wilma?

810
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:02,916
What… h-happened?

811
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,625
Uh, hey. You two need to head to town.

812
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:08,541
Find Kat.

813
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,416
Kat's here?

814
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:12,083
Yes.

815
01:00:14,125 --> 01:00:15,458
What's your name, son?

816
01:00:16,666 --> 01:00:18,791
Raúl. Now, please, hurry!

817
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:35,166
-You stole our cream, Raúl.

818
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:37,791
Raised up our Hell Maiden's parents!

819
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:45,375
Something ain't right up there.

820
01:00:50,541 --> 01:00:52,416
Wake up, you bums.

821
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,375
Got a hair emergency.

822
01:00:54,958 --> 01:00:56,666
Wake up, c'mon, wake up!

823
01:00:57,166 --> 01:00:58,000
Fine.

824
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:03,875
Ugh. You boys look terrible.

825
01:01:05,958 --> 01:01:06,791
What?

826
01:01:06,875 --> 01:01:07,750
Hmm!

827
01:01:08,375 --> 01:01:09,875
Soul Jockeys!

828
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,000
On the double!

829
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:21,041
What the…

830
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:32,166
Yeah!

831
01:01:41,833 --> 01:01:42,666
Hey!

832
01:01:56,125 --> 01:01:58,416
How many dead folks have they raised?

833
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:09,791
What?

834
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:23,291
-Ah!

835
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:09,541
Is that you, Kat?

836
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:12,458
You've grown so much!

837
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:14,458
Mom! Dad!

838
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:22,500
-It's-- It's okay.

839
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:24,500
I got you back.

840
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,375
-Aw!

841
01:03:29,708 --> 01:03:30,833
Mmm.

842
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:35,541
It's so wonderful to see you, Kat,
but how is this possible?

843
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:37,625
Why are we alive now?

844
01:03:39,041 --> 01:03:40,458
Doesn't matter, does it?

845
01:03:42,083 --> 01:03:45,166
Hey! I still have the Cyclops, Dad.

846
01:03:45,666 --> 01:03:48,750
That boom box could shake
a room.

847
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:50,083
And this too, Mom.

848
01:03:50,166 --> 01:03:52,833
Was wondering where that went. Hmm.

849
01:03:53,416 --> 01:03:57,000
I swear
I told these people no deal.

850
01:03:57,958 --> 01:04:01,083
Damn Klax Korp signs are everywhere!

851
01:04:01,166 --> 01:04:04,250
You're a lot tougher, aren't you?

852
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:05,333
Had to be,

853
01:04:06,166 --> 01:04:07,166
since I…

854
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:09,625
I killed you.

855
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:11,250
You-- You didn't kill us, Kat.

856
01:04:11,333 --> 01:04:13,958
Only reason you crashed
is 'cause I screamed.

857
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:16,083
It was an accident, Kat.

858
01:04:16,166 --> 01:04:17,625
You were only eight, Kat.

859
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:20,083
-Your-- Your hand!

860
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:21,458
-Whoa!

861
01:04:21,541 --> 01:04:22,916
Wha-- Wha-- What?

862
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:24,333
Kat!

863
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,791
Wh-Whoa!

864
01:04:32,166 --> 01:04:35,833
Look, I made this deal
with some demon brothers.

865
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:38,500
-Demons?
-Demons? Why?

866
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,958
Because they promised
to bring you back to life.

867
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:42,541
And they did!

868
01:04:42,625 --> 01:04:46,083
It wasn't demons. It was--
It was this kid, Raúl.

869
01:04:46,166 --> 01:04:47,458
Raúl?

870
01:04:47,541 --> 01:04:48,958
Said he was your friend.

871
01:04:49,625 --> 01:04:51,625
I-- I don't have friends.

872
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:54,875
-He's in danger, isn't he?
-Maybe.

873
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:57,583
If he's in danger,
then we gotta go help him.

874
01:04:58,166 --> 01:04:59,708
But I just got you back!

875
01:04:59,791 --> 01:05:02,041
Friends are like family, Kat.

876
01:05:02,125 --> 01:05:04,375
We do whatever we can for them.

877
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:08,458
Fine, fine! I'll take care of Raúl.

878
01:05:08,541 --> 01:05:11,500
You two just stay in the house
where I can find you again.

879
01:05:14,083 --> 01:05:15,458
Save him, baby.

880
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
But be careful.

881
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:21,000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
What are we gonna do, Wendell?

882
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:23,583
If the Klaxons find out,
our faire is toast!

883
01:05:23,666 --> 01:05:26,583
-You gotta tell the Padre.
-No, <i>you </i>have to tell him.

884
01:05:26,666 --> 01:05:29,541
You're older, Wendell.
You have to do it.

885
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:34,083
Pipe down, Spark Plug!
Can't hear ourselves think!

886
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,708
-Kat!
-Shh!

887
01:06:17,583 --> 01:06:20,125
I swear--

888
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:25,250
-You hear somethin'?

889
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:28,041
I smell somethin'. Our falafel dinner?

890
01:06:32,916 --> 01:06:35,583
You greedy bug's turd!

891
01:06:35,666 --> 01:06:37,750
You ate our Hell Maiden!

892
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:41,333
Oh, and you ate
little Raúl as well.

893
01:06:44,541 --> 01:06:48,000
I am literally traumatized!

894
01:06:50,291 --> 01:06:52,333
I'mma miss this cream when it's gone.

895
01:06:52,416 --> 01:06:54,375
Yeah, well, not as much as old Belzer.

896
01:06:57,375 --> 01:06:59,958
Where are they?

897
01:07:03,166 --> 01:07:08,666
So, you took my last two sons
to the Land of the Living?

898
01:07:11,291 --> 01:07:13,458
With my magic hair cream?

899
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:14,833
Mm-hmm.

900
01:07:15,416 --> 01:07:18,250
See? That wasn't so hard, right?

901
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:19,166
No.

902
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,708
Thanks for saving me.

903
01:07:28,791 --> 01:07:30,625
We're still not friends, Raúl.

904
01:07:34,291 --> 01:07:35,750
You stole Bearz-a-bub.

905
01:07:38,458 --> 01:07:40,583
And you summoned your demons.

906
01:07:40,666 --> 01:07:42,916
Let go! My parents are waiting.

907
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,916
Your… dead parents?

908
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,666
It was my fault they died.

909
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:50,375
I had to get them back. Let go of me!

910
01:07:50,458 --> 01:07:53,000
Demons can't bring back the dead.

911
01:07:53,083 --> 01:07:55,791
Well, they had this magic hair cream.

912
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:57,833
Uh…

913
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:05,708
Raúl, tell Kat's parents
I'll need her for a while.

914
01:08:05,791 --> 01:08:09,083
Why should I do
anything you tell me?

915
01:08:12,833 --> 01:08:15,125
You too?

916
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:16,833
That's right.

917
01:08:31,666 --> 01:08:34,625
-Manberg, we need your help.

918
01:08:35,208 --> 01:08:36,208
Really?

919
01:08:37,625 --> 01:08:38,791
My bear!

920
01:08:39,416 --> 01:08:42,166
Oh, have you missed me, evil thing?

921
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:44,083
Now, Manberg.

922
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:45,625
Fine, fine.

923
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:50,000
-Wow.

924
01:08:50,083 --> 01:08:53,916
-She has sworn allegiance to her demons.

925
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,500
-And the fever is spreading.

926
01:08:58,083 --> 01:08:59,083
My fault.

927
01:08:59,583 --> 01:09:02,833
-Well, only one thing to do…

928
01:09:03,666 --> 01:09:05,583
Full quarantine!

929
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:11,041
You--
You don't understand, Manberg.

930
01:09:11,125 --> 01:09:14,208
Kat's demons are raising
an army of the dead!

931
01:09:14,291 --> 01:09:16,250
A whole army, you say?

932
01:09:16,333 --> 01:09:20,666
Yes! And we'll need
two Hell Maidens to stop them!

933
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:25,041
So, now what?

934
01:09:25,625 --> 01:09:28,916
-Blood-bind us, Manberg.

935
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,916
Blood-bind could kill you.

936
01:09:31,416 --> 01:09:32,958
Just do it!

937
01:09:35,916 --> 01:09:37,083
Ah!

938
01:09:45,333 --> 01:09:48,000
Now, open the Redemption Chamber, Manberg.

939
01:10:00,625 --> 01:10:03,500
-Worst bunions ever!

940
01:10:03,583 --> 01:10:05,708
There's nothin' to be happy about anymore.

941
01:10:05,791 --> 01:10:08,583
Don't need this kind of aggravation.

942
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:13,458
Some say Rust Bank is already lost,
a ghost town.

943
01:10:13,541 --> 01:10:16,583
-Oy!
-So, why block Klax Korp again?

944
01:10:17,291 --> 01:10:21,125
Because I know they caused
the fire that killed our friends

945
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:22,541
and destroyed this town.

946
01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:26,625
-You're preaching to the choir, honey.
-Let's get to voting!

947
01:10:26,708 --> 01:10:28,000
Of course, ladies.

948
01:10:28,666 --> 01:10:32,833
All here in favor of Klax Korp Prison,
raise your right hand.

949
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:35,000
-Boo!
-Over my dead body!

950
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,916
Now, all opposed.

951
01:10:41,875 --> 01:10:43,791
-Ooh! Zombies?

952
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:46,208
-Corpses!
-We're being invaded!

953
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:51,291
Uh,<i> perdóname</i>, but this is--
is council members only!

954
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,291
Colonel Bumstrop, is that you?

955
01:10:59,125 --> 01:11:02,750
My Lord, Cassandra,
it's the old-guard members!

956
01:11:02,833 --> 01:11:05,333
But they died! Years ago!

957
01:11:05,416 --> 01:11:08,875
In my professional opinion,
these men are alive.

958
01:11:08,958 --> 01:11:11,583
Come on, Doc, you're just a foot guy.

959
01:11:11,666 --> 01:11:14,208
-Podiatrists are real doctors--

960
01:11:14,291 --> 01:11:15,125
Shh!

961
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:23,041
It seems they do have a right to be here
and the right to vote.

962
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:25,458
Mariana, have you lost your mind?

963
01:11:25,541 --> 01:11:29,416
I have to, Fawzi.
All living council members get to vote.

964
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:35,166
All those in favor
of Klax Korp Prison,

965
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:36,791
raise your right hand.

966
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:44,291
The yays have it, six to five.

967
01:11:46,875 --> 01:11:50,708
Holy moly! Can that really be correct?

968
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:53,250
-Their votes actually count?

969
01:11:54,333 --> 01:11:55,166
<i>Sí.</i>

970
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:58,083
They won.

971
01:11:58,166 --> 01:11:59,583
-No!

972
01:12:00,791 --> 01:12:02,666
Finally!

973
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:06,375
Oh, excellent work, Father!

974
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:08,083
-Hear, hear!

975
01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:10,583
This'll keep you in wafers and wine.

976
01:12:10,666 --> 01:12:13,916
Eh, my school and my partners thank you.

977
01:12:16,125 --> 01:12:19,000
Ah, and bless you, my child.

978
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:21,250
F-Father Bests!

979
01:12:21,333 --> 01:12:22,500
Toodle-oo!

980
01:12:22,583 --> 01:12:23,916
Siobhan!

981
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,750
Come join the celebration!

982
01:12:25,833 --> 01:12:27,791
We've finally won the vote!

983
01:12:28,541 --> 01:12:29,500
Uh…

984
01:12:29,583 --> 01:12:33,250
Mummy, Daddy,
I know the truth about your prisons.

985
01:12:33,333 --> 01:12:35,041
And what is that, Siobhan?

986
01:12:35,125 --> 01:12:38,875
Well, you make a pile of money
for every prisoner you take.

987
01:12:38,958 --> 01:12:42,750
So you pack them in like sardines,
provide crap food, crap medical,

988
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:45,541
dangerous conditions,
and zero rehabilitation.

989
01:12:47,375 --> 01:12:49,708
I am proud of you, dear.

990
01:12:49,791 --> 01:12:52,916
That's our business model, exactly.

991
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,125
Don't some people deserve
a second chance? Like Kay-Kay?

992
01:12:56,208 --> 01:12:59,916
Oh, we love those Break the Cycle kids.

993
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,625
Going to bus them in
by the hundreds to your school.

994
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:06,541
Then, we make it impossible
for them to succeed there.

995
01:13:06,625 --> 01:13:07,958
And when they fail…

996
01:13:08,041 --> 01:13:12,541
Our new prison will be waiting
with open arms.

997
01:13:16,333 --> 01:13:19,958
You're really going to do it, aren't you?
Demolish Rust Bank?

998
01:13:20,041 --> 01:13:21,500
First thing tomorrow!

999
01:13:21,583 --> 01:13:24,916
The governor's coming, the press.
Everybody will be there.

1000
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,875
-Promise you'll be there, Siobhan.

1001
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:27,958
All smiles?

1002
01:13:28,041 --> 01:13:30,166
Uh, I have to go now.

1003
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:32,125
I-- I have to feed Gabby.

1004
01:13:32,208 --> 01:13:34,583
I want my promise!

1005
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:38,625
Oh,
I'll be there, Mummy. I promise.

1006
01:13:38,708 --> 01:13:40,375
That's my girl!

1007
01:13:43,916 --> 01:13:47,833
Kat, your memories
are what fuels the fever.

1008
01:13:48,333 --> 01:13:50,208
My memories?

1009
01:13:50,708 --> 01:13:51,541
Yes.

1010
01:13:52,375 --> 01:13:54,333
Time to face your past.

1011
01:13:55,291 --> 01:13:56,125
Ready?

1012
01:13:56,625 --> 01:13:57,458
Mm-hmm.

1013
01:14:58,291 --> 01:14:59,291
No!

1014
01:15:18,875 --> 01:15:22,000
<i>I swear it…</i>

1015
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:28,666
Your memories made this monster!

1016
01:15:35,416 --> 01:15:37,083
Ow!

1017
01:15:43,083 --> 01:15:45,583
Make it stop, Sister Helley, please!

1018
01:15:46,791 --> 01:15:48,708
Only you can do that, Kat.

1019
01:15:50,416 --> 01:15:52,000
It's too strong…

1020
01:15:52,083 --> 01:15:53,791
You are stronger!

1021
01:15:54,291 --> 01:15:57,750
Go on now, own your memories!

1022
01:16:04,791 --> 01:16:08,250
You've tortured me for years.

1023
01:16:09,625 --> 01:16:12,375
But you made me a survivor!

1024
01:16:13,875 --> 01:16:15,583
And crazy powerful!

1025
01:16:32,708 --> 01:16:34,916
I'm in control of my life now!

1026
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,375
Not you!

1027
01:16:41,875 --> 01:16:43,500
Kat!

1028
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:47,000
Partners! Look!

1029
01:16:48,041 --> 01:16:49,041
We're rich!

1030
01:16:50,541 --> 01:16:53,208
Come on, what's wrong, huh?

1031
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:56,750
We saved RBC and the faire!

1032
01:16:56,833 --> 01:17:00,166
Can't keep that money.

1033
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:02,291
-Why not?
-Um…

1034
01:17:02,375 --> 01:17:05,458
Raisin' the dead didn't stop
with the old guard.

1035
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:08,291
You-- You raised Kat's parents?

1036
01:17:08,375 --> 01:17:09,708
Wasn't us.

1037
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:11,791
Was our ungrateful gravedigger!

1038
01:17:11,875 --> 01:17:14,541
Him?! Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

1039
01:17:16,458 --> 01:17:19,250
Yes! Hitch up the wagon!

1040
01:17:19,333 --> 01:17:22,291
-So what's the game plan, Padre?

1041
01:17:22,375 --> 01:17:25,916
Ding-Dong Ditch… with a twist!

1042
01:17:27,541 --> 01:17:31,541
Kat! Kat!

1043
01:17:58,458 --> 01:17:59,583
You did it.

1044
01:18:00,958 --> 01:18:01,958
And now…

1045
01:18:03,875 --> 01:18:04,916
…your power.

1046
01:18:08,041 --> 01:18:09,125
<i>Touched it.</i>

1047
01:18:16,708 --> 01:18:18,916
I-- I can see the future.

1048
01:18:23,291 --> 01:18:24,250
Oh, no.

1049
01:18:26,208 --> 01:18:29,375
-Helley's in trouble! Open up!

1050
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:34,541
I'm coming for you, boys.

1051
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:46,375
-Soul Jockeys!

1052
01:18:47,875 --> 01:18:49,708
Yah!

1053
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:04,083
-It's Kat!

1054
01:19:07,625 --> 01:19:09,000
Almost there, Kat.

1055
01:19:10,833 --> 01:19:11,875
Hey, baby!

1056
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:15,250
-Hey! You!

1057
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:18,416
-What's goin' on?
-Oh, no, oh, my!

1058
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,125
I can see your hat.

1059
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:21,458
-Ding-dong!
-Gotcha!

1060
01:19:21,541 --> 01:19:22,500
Who are you?

1061
01:19:43,791 --> 01:19:44,958
Sister Helley.

1062
01:19:49,291 --> 01:19:52,083
She passed out, cracked her head.

1063
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:53,000
Oh!

1064
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:57,416
Talk to me, Helley.

1065
01:19:59,666 --> 01:20:01,583
You don't get to smack me.

1066
01:20:01,666 --> 01:20:04,333
You're alive!

1067
01:20:04,416 --> 01:20:05,291
Barely.

1068
01:20:05,791 --> 01:20:06,750
What about Kat?

1069
01:20:11,625 --> 01:20:13,083
Hmm.

1070
01:20:13,916 --> 01:20:16,958
Good. You broke the fever, Helley.

1071
01:20:17,041 --> 01:20:18,458
She is clear.

1072
01:20:18,541 --> 01:20:22,291
Thank you so much, Sister Helley!

1073
01:20:22,375 --> 01:20:23,333
We made it.

1074
01:20:25,041 --> 01:20:27,375
This-- This new power…

1075
01:20:28,041 --> 01:20:31,125
It'll be unpredictable
at first, but then--

1076
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:34,375
-Thank God, Kat! I've been looking all--

1077
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,416
More demons?

1078
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,000
I collect them.

1079
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:43,125
-Why are you here, Raúl?
-Your parents, Kat.

1080
01:20:43,208 --> 01:20:45,875
They're gonna put them back
in the ground. I just know it!

1081
01:20:45,958 --> 01:20:48,500
I'm going to kill Wendell and Wild!

1082
01:20:48,583 --> 01:20:52,208
With two Hell Maidens, we cannot fail!

1083
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:56,250
Go ahead, Manberg.
This Maiden needs a moment.

1084
01:20:56,333 --> 01:20:59,750
Fine, but don't be long.

1085
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:09,416
-Kay-Kay? It's me, Siobhan.

1086
01:21:10,041 --> 01:21:11,375
And your biggest fan!

1087
01:21:15,291 --> 01:21:18,125
Fine. I-- I deserve the silent treatment.

1088
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:20,208
But there's an emergency.

1089
01:21:27,125 --> 01:21:27,958
Kat?

1090
01:21:30,541 --> 01:21:32,708
-Bad goat, Gabby! Put that down!

1091
01:21:33,291 --> 01:21:35,375
Gabby, stop! Where are you going?

1092
01:21:37,958 --> 01:21:40,125
-Gabby!

1093
01:21:43,625 --> 01:21:46,500
Hey, aren't you forgetting something?

1094
01:21:46,583 --> 01:21:48,208
-Oh.
-Yeah.

1095
01:21:48,875 --> 01:21:51,291
-Huh?

1096
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:53,791
So, any last words?

1097
01:21:54,416 --> 01:21:56,958
Huh. I thought you'd be taller.

1098
01:21:57,458 --> 01:21:59,458
I am taller.

1099
01:21:59,541 --> 01:22:02,416
Are those cartoon mallets?

1100
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:05,250
What? Cartoon mallets?!

1101
01:22:05,333 --> 01:22:06,375
Padre!

1102
01:22:06,458 --> 01:22:10,125
Ah, yes. May the Lord look kindly on you

1103
01:22:10,208 --> 01:22:13,875
and give you everlasting peace.

1104
01:22:17,291 --> 01:22:18,333
-Ow!

1105
01:22:18,416 --> 01:22:21,083
-All right, here it comes!
-One, two…

1106
01:22:21,166 --> 01:22:22,541
-Boom!
-Ow!

1107
01:22:22,625 --> 01:22:25,833
-Kat was scarier when she was three.

1108
01:22:25,916 --> 01:22:28,166
And I'm way scarier now!

1109
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:30,083
-Hell Maiden!
-You're alive!

1110
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:32,000
Let my parents go!

1111
01:22:32,083 --> 01:22:34,666
It's, um--
N-No can do, Hell Maiden. You see…

1112
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:37,750
Uh, you s-- What--
You still got 800 tasks to complete.

1113
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:39,875
That is right. So, as your masters,

1114
01:22:39,958 --> 01:22:42,875
we order you to turn around and, uh…

1115
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:47,000
Pfft! You're trippin'!

1116
01:22:47,875 --> 01:22:50,083
I'm not your puppet anymore.

1117
01:22:50,166 --> 01:22:51,166
Dang right!

1118
01:22:55,458 --> 01:22:58,666
-Spark Plug!
-Help, Sparky!

1119
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:00,125
You disappoint me, Father.

1120
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:01,958
Oh. Oh, no.

1121
01:23:02,875 --> 01:23:03,916
Kat.

1122
01:23:08,708 --> 01:23:10,041
Why'd you do it?

1123
01:23:10,125 --> 01:23:12,708
Uh, they-- they--
they were just my size, and I--

1124
01:23:12,791 --> 01:23:14,916
Not the boots, my parents!

1125
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,166
Why were you putting them in their graves?

1126
01:23:17,250 --> 01:23:19,333
P-Padre here said it was the only way.

1127
01:23:19,416 --> 01:23:21,791
To save our Dream Faire.

1128
01:23:21,875 --> 01:23:25,250
And it was the only way to save my school.

1129
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:26,208
What?

1130
01:23:28,166 --> 01:23:29,208
Gabby Goat?

1131
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:30,666
-Hello?

1132
01:23:31,208 --> 01:23:32,833
-What?
-Who's she?

1133
01:23:37,708 --> 01:23:40,166
What's going on here, Kay-Kay?

1134
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:45,500
Well, for starters,
Sister Helley and I are Hell Maidens.

1135
01:23:45,583 --> 01:23:48,000
And if you call me Kay-Kay one more time--

1136
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:51,750
O-Of course, you are a Hell Maiden, Kat.

1137
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:57,875
Father Bests,
my parents don't want to save your school.

1138
01:23:57,958 --> 01:24:00,166
-Huh?
-Or build some funfair.

1139
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:03,041
-But they already paid us.

1140
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:04,375
-Ahhh!

1141
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,833
Wh-Wh-What is this?

1142
01:24:08,916 --> 01:24:13,333
It's how they pay all Klax Korp personnel.
Worthless in the real world.

1143
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:17,500
I need to show you something.

1144
01:24:22,291 --> 01:24:25,125
You were right, Kat, about my parents.

1145
01:24:25,875 --> 01:24:27,416
Private prisons.

1146
01:24:28,125 --> 01:24:29,375
We have to stop them.

1147
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:53,000
It's too late.

1148
01:24:53,083 --> 01:24:54,416
What-- What do you mean?

1149
01:24:54,916 --> 01:24:57,083
There's not gonna be a Rust Bank anymore!

1150
01:24:57,166 --> 01:24:59,416
You saw the future.

1151
01:25:04,291 --> 01:25:05,500
What's going on?

1152
01:25:06,833 --> 01:25:07,666
Delroy?

1153
01:25:11,208 --> 01:25:12,333
It's him!

1154
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:20,750
-Fee-fi-fo-fum.

1155
01:25:20,833 --> 01:25:24,958
I smell the blood of two thieving bums!

1156
01:25:26,916 --> 01:25:30,750
Oh, this is better than the undead army!

1157
01:25:30,833 --> 01:25:34,833
Where's my hair cream?

1158
01:25:35,458 --> 01:25:36,750
You stole it!

1159
01:25:36,833 --> 01:25:38,625
Now he's gonna kill us!

1160
01:25:38,708 --> 01:25:42,083
Everyone, down to the hearse,
and don't draw attention!

1161
01:25:42,166 --> 01:25:43,708
-Wendell?

1162
01:25:44,291 --> 01:25:45,333
-Wild?

1163
01:25:45,416 --> 01:25:48,375
-I know you're up here!

1164
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:52,083
Now, come on, boys,

1165
01:25:52,583 --> 01:25:54,250
I'm not going to hurt you.

1166
01:25:59,375 --> 01:26:02,125
My greatest prize ever!

1167
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:04,750
-What the?!

1168
01:26:06,583 --> 01:26:08,708
Who's messing…

1169
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:12,416
-Come on!
-Let's go!

1170
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:15,708
There you are, my thieving mutts!

1171
01:26:15,791 --> 01:26:19,000
Scream Faire Daddy's gonna strum…

1172
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,250
your…

1173
01:26:22,666 --> 01:26:25,333
…guts!

1174
01:26:27,625 --> 01:26:29,416
Uh, no, you don't!

1175
01:26:33,958 --> 01:26:35,916
-Yeah, all right, man!
-Yeah!

1176
01:26:37,583 --> 01:26:38,541
All right!

1177
01:26:46,166 --> 01:26:48,958
Got you!

1178
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:04,250
Why did you do it?

1179
01:27:04,333 --> 01:27:07,583
Wh-Wh-Wh-What, steal your cream?

1180
01:27:07,666 --> 01:27:09,916
Come to the Land of the Living?

1181
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:12,833
Well, why wouldn't we?

1182
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:14,458
Dad!

1183
01:27:14,541 --> 01:27:18,750
My Scream Faire did not need
some radical new design!

1184
01:27:20,375 --> 01:27:21,541
Does now.

1185
01:27:24,708 --> 01:27:25,541
Oh!

1186
01:27:26,166 --> 01:27:30,500
My cream… It's all gone!

1187
01:27:39,416 --> 01:27:41,541
Raúl's art project.

1188
01:27:42,875 --> 01:27:47,083
A parent… protecting their child.

1189
01:27:47,166 --> 01:27:48,541
What we all try to do.

1190
01:27:48,625 --> 01:27:49,750
Every parent.

1191
01:27:50,791 --> 01:27:51,833
Not me.

1192
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:55,708
There were others before you
that ran away.

1193
01:27:56,333 --> 01:27:57,666
We had siblings?

1194
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:59,250
"Hell with them," I said.

1195
01:27:59,333 --> 01:28:02,166
"They'll be back,
tails between their legs."

1196
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:04,250
But they never came home.

1197
01:28:04,791 --> 01:28:06,250
Hello, up there!

1198
01:28:06,333 --> 01:28:08,666
Demon Lord!

1199
01:28:09,666 --> 01:28:11,333
It's Buffalo Belzer.

1200
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:15,625
Fine, Mr. Belzer.
I, Manberg the Merciless,

1201
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:18,583
am a sworn enemy of demons,

1202
01:28:18,666 --> 01:28:20,666
but not of families.

1203
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:24,250
Is that you, Belissa?

1204
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:27,500
I have all your missing children.

1205
01:28:27,583 --> 01:28:28,750
Go on.

1206
01:28:28,833 --> 01:28:31,750
Let my friends go, and they're yours.

1207
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:35,958
I accept, Manberg the Merciful.

1208
01:28:36,041 --> 01:28:37,375
"Merci-less"!

1209
01:28:41,625 --> 01:28:45,458
Gnasher, Wincer, Heddie.

1210
01:28:45,541 --> 01:28:47,541
Look at you, Zostril!

1211
01:28:49,541 --> 01:28:51,333
Let me tell you,

1212
01:28:51,416 --> 01:28:56,500
uh, reports of my death
were greatly exaggerated…

1213
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:58,625
He dead again?

1214
01:28:59,166 --> 01:29:00,791
Gave him plenty of cream.

1215
01:29:00,875 --> 01:29:04,666
Dang, you raised him
from the dead with hair cream?

1216
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:07,083
Well… yes.

1217
01:29:07,166 --> 01:29:10,875
Come on, boys, that stuff just don't last.

1218
01:29:11,708 --> 01:29:13,458
"Stuff don't last"?

1219
01:29:13,541 --> 01:29:15,666
-Don't be long, sons.

1220
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:19,041
Can't build a new faire
without the designers.

1221
01:29:19,125 --> 01:29:21,375
-You mean us?
-We'll make you proud, Pop!

1222
01:29:21,958 --> 01:29:23,000
That's right!

1223
01:29:27,583 --> 01:29:31,083
"Stuff don't last"?
What about my parents?!

1224
01:29:31,166 --> 01:29:34,541
No, a-a-all that's required
is a-- a fresh dose of cream.

1225
01:29:34,625 --> 01:29:35,625
Worked for Padre.

1226
01:29:35,708 --> 01:29:36,916
It's empty!

1227
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,666
-Squeeze it right, be enough for days.
-Weeks!

1228
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:44,500
Hmm. Now we have loved
every single second with you, baby,

1229
01:29:44,583 --> 01:29:45,958
but Rust Bank's in trouble.

1230
01:29:46,041 --> 01:29:51,041
What if that last bit
of magic could help save our town?

1231
01:29:51,125 --> 01:29:53,791
I already told you it's too late!

1232
01:29:53,875 --> 01:29:57,166
No, Kat, you <i>can </i>change that future.

1233
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:58,958
Really?

1234
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,416
My mother thinks the fire was on purpose.

1235
01:30:05,333 --> 01:30:06,875
Needs a witness to prove it.

1236
01:30:08,291 --> 01:30:11,166
Raúl, raise a dead brew worker.

1237
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:13,416
Oh, a witness.

1238
01:30:14,291 --> 01:30:16,791
If you squeeze it right,
be enough for two.

1239
01:30:16,875 --> 01:30:18,000
Three witnesses!

1240
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:22,458
Meanwhile, we're gonna protect
Rust Bank 'til he gets back.

1241
01:30:22,541 --> 01:30:23,916
That's it, Kat!

1242
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,083
Everyone, ready to hold that line?

1243
01:30:26,166 --> 01:30:27,291
-Let's do this!

1244
01:30:27,375 --> 01:30:28,458
Oh, yeah!

1245
01:30:29,833 --> 01:30:33,916
Down with Klax Korp!
Down with Klax Korp!

1246
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,958
Down with Klax Korp!

1247
01:30:36,041 --> 01:30:38,083
Down with Klax Korp!

1248
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:42,250
But Lane,
Siobhan promised Mummy she'd come!

1249
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:46,375
We have to start, Irmgard.
Governor Bribes.

1250
01:30:46,458 --> 01:30:48,458
No more Klax Korp!

1251
01:30:48,541 --> 01:30:50,333
No more Klax Korp!

1252
01:30:50,416 --> 01:30:52,541
-No more Klax Korp!

1253
01:30:52,625 --> 01:30:54,166
Good morning, voters!

1254
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:55,791
Today, it's out with the old

1255
01:30:55,875 --> 01:30:59,833
and in with the newest,
biggest construction project

1256
01:30:59,916 --> 01:31:01,625
in our state's history!

1257
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:08,833
Now, my partners in crime,
Lane and Irmgard Klaxon!

1258
01:31:08,916 --> 01:31:11,000
-Thank you. Thank you.

1259
01:31:11,083 --> 01:31:12,458
No need, thank you.

1260
01:31:12,541 --> 01:31:16,958
When your governor offered us
millions to build our prison here,

1261
01:31:17,041 --> 01:31:19,291
we fell in love with Rust Bank.

1262
01:31:19,375 --> 01:31:23,166
A love sorely tested by that lot!

1263
01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:25,666
-We blocked you every year!

1264
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:27,833
Should I do the honors, Irmgard?

1265
01:31:27,916 --> 01:31:30,250
-Don't mind if I do.

1266
01:31:30,333 --> 01:31:33,750
Gentlemen, start your engines!

1267
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:43,250
And it's ready, steady--

1268
01:31:43,333 --> 01:31:45,083
Wait! Look!

1269
01:31:56,333 --> 01:31:59,541
Dear God, Siobhan's been brainwashed!

1270
01:32:02,166 --> 01:32:05,625
Go! Go! Go! Crush them all!

1271
01:32:09,291 --> 01:32:10,375
Let's go!

1272
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:12,208
That future ain't gonna happen!

1273
01:32:54,958 --> 01:32:56,041
My bear!

1274
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:36,791
Your parents!

1275
01:33:54,791 --> 01:33:56,500
-Wendell, look!

1276
01:34:00,083 --> 01:34:02,583
Good old Soul Jockeys.

1277
01:34:02,666 --> 01:34:04,416
Dad must've sent them.

1278
01:34:15,666 --> 01:34:17,583
Lane and Irmgard Klaxon,

1279
01:34:17,666 --> 01:34:19,625
you're under arrest
for arson and homicide.

1280
01:34:19,708 --> 01:34:21,666
What?! That's preposterous!

1281
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:24,958
Can't prove a bloody thing
without witnesses!

1282
01:34:28,166 --> 01:34:30,875
Officers, your witnesses.

1283
01:34:30,958 --> 01:34:33,083
Wait, wait! It was all <i>her</i> doing!

1284
01:34:33,166 --> 01:34:36,791
-My wife's the murderer, not me!
-How dare you, Lane?!

1285
01:34:45,166 --> 01:34:48,875
Good news, everyone!
Klax Korp is finished!

1286
01:34:48,958 --> 01:34:50,375
-You did it!

1287
01:34:50,458 --> 01:34:52,416
We did it!

1288
01:34:53,583 --> 01:34:54,916
Victory!

1289
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:05,916
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

1290
01:35:07,375 --> 01:35:08,625
Poor Hell Maiden.

1291
01:35:08,708 --> 01:35:10,708
Cream lost its magic.

1292
01:35:11,708 --> 01:35:13,208
Mom, Dad…

1293
01:35:14,875 --> 01:35:15,875
Tell us…

1294
01:35:16,458 --> 01:35:19,625
Tell us about Rust Bank, Kat,
in the future.

1295
01:35:19,708 --> 01:35:20,916
What-- What do you see?

1296
01:35:23,375 --> 01:35:26,166
Hold tight, and close your eyes.

1297
01:35:33,041 --> 01:35:35,041
<i>Rust Bank's comin' back to life.</i>

1298
01:35:44,708 --> 01:35:45,875
<i>Folks comin' home.</i>

1299
01:35:54,041 --> 01:35:56,250
<i>I'm doin' stuff with Sister Helley</i>

1300
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:58,541
<i>and Ms. Hunter.</i>

1301
01:36:09,583 --> 01:36:12,833
So proud of you, baby.

1302
01:36:12,916 --> 01:36:17,458
-How much do we love her, Delroy?
-So, so, so much.

1303
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:24,500
I love you too.

1304
01:36:28,125 --> 01:36:31,083
You know, once our Dream Faire gets built…

1305
01:36:31,166 --> 01:36:35,791
It's gonna be about the best afterlife,
upstairs or down.

1306
01:36:36,458 --> 01:36:37,500
What do you mean?

1307
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,458
Your parents!

1308
01:36:39,541 --> 01:36:42,791
Yeah, get them an all-inclusive VIP pass!

1309
01:36:42,875 --> 01:36:44,333
That's ridiculous.

1310
01:36:44,416 --> 01:36:46,666
Well, now, hold on.
J-J-Just-- Just check it out.

1311
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:49,083
Wow!

1312
01:37:00,083 --> 01:37:00,958
Wow!

1313
01:37:11,458 --> 01:37:13,000
Holy moly!

1314
01:37:13,083 --> 01:37:15,500
Oh, my gosh!

1315
01:37:19,666 --> 01:37:22,791
<i>I was supposed to hate myself</i>
<i>for the rest of my life.</i>

1316
01:37:22,875 --> 01:37:26,791
Mom, Dad, I… What do you think?

1317
01:37:27,333 --> 01:37:29,125
<i>But now, I don't have to.</i>

1318
01:37:29,625 --> 01:37:32,625
<i>I'm a Hell Maiden with amazing friends.</i>

1319
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:36,083
<i>Even you, Wendell and Wild.</i>

1320
01:43:53,958 --> 01:43:55,166
Hi, guys.

1321
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:58,166
It's pretty late.
It's 3:30 in the morning.

1322
01:43:59,083 --> 01:44:03,541
And I just woke up
because I heard some noises next door,

1323
01:44:03,625 --> 01:44:07,000
in the room next door,
and you won't believe what-- what I found.

1324
01:44:07,708 --> 01:44:08,750
Come with me.

1325
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,041
So…

1326
01:44:16,541 --> 01:44:18,458
I'm going to open the door now.

1327
01:44:18,541 --> 01:44:19,458
Shh.

1328
01:44:28,541 --> 01:44:29,500
Hello.

1329
01:44:30,083 --> 01:44:31,625
Hey, where are you hiding?

1330
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:35,291
Come on.

1331
01:44:35,375 --> 01:44:37,208
Ah, here you are.

1332
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,458
Hi, Kat. How are you?

1333
01:44:40,416 --> 01:44:41,833
What are you doing here?

1334
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:46,625
Maybe she was getting bored
at the studio, alone.
