1
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,837
All right, folks.
Can we all settle down for a sec?

2
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,006
I know that you...

3
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,633
-Hey, you settle down.
-No.

4
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,344
Come on, everybody, settle down.
Sandy, come on.

5
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,678
So... No, none of that.

6
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:21,557
This is not a time to make sillyjokes.
It's the time for a little bit of talking

7
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,518
before we really get to the important part.

8
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:26,229
Here we go. Well, it's been
another great year here at JAMS.

9
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,273
Who can forget
Mr. Pinkus' Haunted Classroom?

10
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:32,235
-Thank you, Sandy, for that.
-Yeah, I ain't afraid of no ghost.

11
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,615
Or the wild success of the book drive
for the women's prison,

12
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,326
which Miss Pavicic's class sponsored?

13
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:44,163
Thank you, Beth.
But, as summer draws upon us,

14
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:47,083
it's time not only to say goodbye
to another school year,

15
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,795
but, sadly, also to say goodbye
to one of our faculty members.

16
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,338
Yes. Elizabeth?

17
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,258
Is Elizabeth Halsey here? There she is.

18
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,509
Elizabeth, can you come on up here?

19
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,763
Yes, that's appropriate, applause, I think.

20
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:06,185
Elizabeth, even though you were
only with us for one short year,

21
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:11,274
please know that we will always consider you
part of the JAMS family.

22
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,734
-That's sweet.
-And we got you a little something.

23
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:16,487
Thank you.

24
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,616
Almost $40.

25
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,369
-Thank you.
-You're very welcome. Speech.

26
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:28,457
Okay, well, I'm really terrible at these
types of things, so I'll make it quick.

27
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:33,212
I know I've only been here a year,
but there's so much I will miss.

28
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,881
My students probably most.

29
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,973
And I wish that I had gotten to know
all of you better.

30
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,521
Happy birthday!

31
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:54,859
But between four classes
and planning a wedding, my plate was full.

32
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,653
Still, l know our students are in good hands.

33
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:03,159
And even though
I'II never teach again professionaIIy,

34
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:07,121
I've realised that I don't need a blackboard
or a classroom

35
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,832
to set an example.

36
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:29,936
Adiós, bitches.

37
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:44,241
Baby doll? I'm home.

38
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,534
In here.

39
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:49,622
Get yourself hard, 'cause I'm gonna suck
your dick like I'm mad at it.

40
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,294
Look, your mom's here. Hi, Mom.
What a fun surprise.

41
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,880
Suitcases. Honey, are we going on a trip?

42
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:01,592
-Elizabeth, we need to talk.
-Sure.

43
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:05,054
I'm starting to think that maybe
we need to take a break.

44
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,430
-Forever.
-Mom.

45
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,683
-Tell her what the accountant said.
-Mom.

46
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:13,646
Steven said that you spent
$16,000 last month.

47
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:15,731
He thinks you're bad news.

48
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,150
-I know women like you.
-Damn it, Mom.

49
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:21,946
-I told you I could handle this.
-I just want to ask her something.

50
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,198
You truly love my son?

51
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,076
I love him so much it hurts.

52
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:31,205
-All right, then. When is his birthday?
-Mom.

53
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:37,586
I'm not, you know... That is just offensive
that you would even ask me that.

54
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,921
It's today.

55
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,676
I know. God.

56
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,846
That's why I got you this.

57
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,390
Okay? Honey, happy birthday.

58
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,351
-Boston Market?
-And I was gonna suck his dick.

59
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:53,519
So two presents.

60
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,314
Okay, fine. I'll sign the prenup.

61
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,734
It's over, Elizabeth.

62
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,694
Mark, I'm pregnant.

63
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,195
-Bullshit.
-No, you're not.

64
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,823
Okay, fine, I'm not actually pregnant.

65
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,159
You know what, I'm starting to wonder

66
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,870
whether this has always been
about the money.

67
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,205
-You never loved me.
-I don't love you?

68
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,709
I have been listening to you whine
about opera for the last year.

69
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:21,672
Okay. If the younger generation
doesn't get into opera, then guess what?

70
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,633
No more opera. An art form has died.

71
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,428
If opera goes away, we're fucked.

72
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,346
I want my ring back.

73
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,641
What am I supposed to do, huh?
Where am I supposed to go?

74
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:11,347
There she is. Elizabeth Halsey.

75
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:17,103
I am so excited we're gonna be
across-the-hall mates,

76
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,898
but I am so sad
it's because your relationship ended.

77
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,692
-Who are you, again?
-Amy Squirrel.

78
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,905
-Squirrel?
-Yeah. You know...

79
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,828
Don't worry,
you were kind of a lone wolf last year

80
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,914
and so busy planning the wedding.

81
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,251
-I found him in bed with somebody else.
-Oh, my gosh.

82
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,379
-It was another man.
-Shut the front door.

83
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,966
Somebody needs a hug.

84
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,259
Somebody doesn't.

85
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:54,223
Look. I know you kind of skated by last year,
doing the bare-minimum thing,

86
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,017
but I just want to say, now you're back,

87
00:07:57,102 --> 00:08:01,313
I just know
you are gonna get your teaching on.

88
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:08,529
I thought the teachers
were supposed to get the apples.

89
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:12,283
Well, I think the students teach me
at least as much as I teach them.

90
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,911
That's just something I say sometimes.

91
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,246
Stupid.

92
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:37,892
Sorry. I just wanted to know
if you wanted to grab some lunch.

93
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,019
I'm kind of in the middle of something, Lynn.

94
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,228
My treat.

95
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,441
You know, Lynn, when I first started teaching

96
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,277
I thought that I was doing it
for all the right reasons.

97
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,863
Shorter hours, summers off,
no accountability.

98
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,908
I love my summers. Fresh corn.

99
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:59,038
From now on, my full-time job is finding
a guy who's gonna take care of me.

100
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,623
God, I pray for that.

101
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:04,251
You know, I spent my entire summer hanging
out at bars near where the Bulls practise.

102
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,296
I had some fun, got some cool souvenirs,

103
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,298
but those guys
are not looking to settle down.

104
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,508
I mean, they all wear condoms,

105
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,720
then they take the condoms with them.
That's how paranoid they are.

106
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:18,307
Like it's so easy to get pregnant
from some dude nutting into a condom.

107
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,809
Yeah. Yeah.

108
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,938
You're gonna find someone great. You are.

109
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:27,900
I've been thinking about it a lot.
I'm like an eight, eight and a half.

110
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,237
But if I got a new pair of tits, right?

111
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,198
You don't wanna do that.
You're already so pretty.

112
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:39,620
You have no idea how difficult it is to
compete against these Barbie doll types.

113
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:44,041
Yeah, that's true.
And we're not getting any younger.

114
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,919
Yeah. Though we should finish up.

115
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,507
Wally's got that big orientation
in the auditorium.

116
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,718
-Yeah, I'm not gonna go to that.
-But it's mandatory.

117
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,475
I probably won't go either.

118
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,769
No, I might.

119
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,314
I'll probably go and just sit in the back.
Maybe leave early.

120
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:13,279
Maybe stay to the end.
Play it by ear, orjust stay to the end.

121
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,156
I don't know.

122
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,576
Okay, well, this was fun, huh?

123
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:30,629
You, me, Aruba, my boat, this weekend,
what do you say?

124
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,881
You think I don't see that faint tan line
on your finger

125
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,883
where your wedding band usually is?

126
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,428
This is not my first rodeo, Sarge.

127
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,347
Why don't you introduce me
to your single co-worker?

128
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:41,932
One o'clock.

129
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,060
-Hey, I'm Jason.
-Hi.

130
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:49,565
-So that's where I learned to water ski.
-I fucking love Lake Geneva.

131
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:57,823
I love your belt! Who makes it?

132
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:02,202
We should do something next weekend.
You should take me somewhere.

133
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:05,039
-You don't have a plane, do you?
-Yeah, right. I'm just a trainee.

134
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,501
-A what?
-A trainee.

135
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,129
-How much more time are we talking here?
-Tomorrow's my last day.

136
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,089
Okay.

137
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,635
The second I finish,
I'm going to my boss's office,

138
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,180
and I'm telling that motherfucker
to go fuck himself.

139
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,724
See, I wanna do something that matters.

140
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,978
I'm going back to school
and becoming an occupational therapist.

141
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:31,231
I wanna do something important,
just like you.

142
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,652
An occupational therapist?

143
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,157
Do I look like I wanna marry
a fucking occupational therapist?

144
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:55,964
Fuck my ass.

145
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:02,513
Welcome to
Air Seventh Grade Social Studies.

146
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,391
l'll be your captain, Miss Squirrel.

147
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:09,353
Cruising altitude for the year will be
worId geography through current events.

148
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,230
We may have a Iayover in civics,

149
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:14,733
so buckIe up,
'cause it's gonna be a crazy ride.

150
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,614
The photographer was, like, so nice.

151
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,659
He made me feel,
like, really, really comfortable.

152
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,578
I might get flown to Kansas City
for their fashion week.

153
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,330
Kansas City!

154
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,332
Stalk much?

155
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,836
Loser.

156
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:58,610
Hi. I'm Sasha Abernathy.
My mother baked these cookies for you.

157
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,737
Just leave 'em on the desk.

158
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,869
You need something?

159
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:14,209
Anyone seen Stand and Deliver?
Show of hands.

160
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,797
You kidding me? Edward James Olmos?

161
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,092
Lou Diamond Phillips?

162
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,929
Wow. All right.

163
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:30,017
You and you, grab the TV and roll it up front.

164
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,144
We're watching a movie on the first day?

165
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,438
I think it's awesome. You rock.

166
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,111
These cookies suck.

167
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,957
WouId everyone pIease try to find a seat?

168
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:58,754
Incoming.

169
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,344
Garrett, honey?

170
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,848
Elizabeth. Hey. Russell.

171
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,768
Russell Gettis, gym teacher.

172
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,396
-We did bus duty together last spring.
-Yeah.

173
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,942
So, I heard about
the whole engagement thing. That blows.

174
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:23,028
Did you know I walked in on him
trying to fuck his dog?

175
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,448
-Peanut butter everywhere.
-That's gross.

176
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,618
Anyway... Hey, might be too soon,

177
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,788
but you wanna, like, grab a bite
or something sometime?

178
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,207
-You still a gym teacher?
-I am, yeah.

179
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,708
Then no.

180
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,796
-I don't date co-workers.
-I won't tell anyone.

181
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,798
I also said no.

182
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:46,051
Okay, cool. Well, this has been awesome.

183
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,847
Somebody's got a case of the sleepies.

184
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,684
-What?
-Did you see the coleslaw altercation?

185
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,981
Yeah. That one kid hit the other kid
with some coleslaw.

186
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:03,026
You weren't at the orientation
the other day. Okay.

187
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,196
Boy, Elizabeth,
you missed a boatload of stuff.

188
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:12,536
Anyways, at the orientation, I suggested
a new system for supervising lunch.

189
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,454
It's a quadrant system.

190
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:17,124
I tell you what,
why don't you just send me a memo,

191
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,167
and, if I have any questions, I'll find you.

192
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,171
Yeah. Meant to ask,

193
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:28,176
did I hear you were showing a movie
this morning on the first day of school?

194
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:30,304
How do I know what you heard?

195
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:33,724
Listen, I don't wanna tell you
how to run your class,

196
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,519
but maybe it might be fun
to try some ice breakers.

197
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,022
Like telephone charades or the string game.

198
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,360
Are we gonna have a problem, me and you?

199
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,280
God, no.

200
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:55,621
If I gave you that impression,
well, I'm so sorry because, actually,

201
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:59,207
I was really hoping we could be
more than just across-the-hall mates.

202
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,794
I don't know what you heard,
but I don't eat muff pie.

203
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,674
No, of course not.
I don't even know what that is.

204
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,761
I just meant friends.

205
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:14,264
Tell you what, friend, I've gotta get going.
Cover me.

206
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,102
Elizabeth, lunch doesn't end
for another seven minutes.

207
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,605
Who's gonna watch your quadrant?

208
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:33,659
Hi, there. You look like Losty McLosterson.

209
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,621
I know, right?
Can you tell me where Room 1 07 is?

210
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,581
I'll do you one better. I'll take you there.

211
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:43,418
-You don't have to do that.
-Stop it. Be my pleasure.

212
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,587
-Scott Delacorte.
-Elizabeth Halsey.

213
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,590
-I'm the new sub.
-Welcome, welcome.

214
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,259
-Thank you.
-Is that a Jaeger-LeCoultre?

215
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,804
-Good eye.
-Thanks.

216
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,847
I love men's watches. It's kind of a hobby.

217
00:16:55,932 --> 00:17:00,227
You know, sometimes I get self-conscious
about it, but my grandfather made it, so...

218
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:03,522
-Your grandfather designs watches?
-The family business.

219
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,273
Yeah, my mother's maiden name
is LeCoultre.

220
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,694
Shut up.

221
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,238
So, did you and your wife just move to town?

222
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:15,325
I'm not married.
I actuallyjust got out of a relationship.

223
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,369
Catherine. Yeah.

224
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,664
It's been a year
and she's still the wallpaper on my phone.

225
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:26,294
-She has such a big heart.
-Looks like enormous.

226
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:34,970
As you can see, the weight is evenly
distributed and there's minimal scarring.

227
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,180
Dr. Vogel, best hands in Chicago.

228
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:42,144
-May I?
-Absolutely. Take 'em for a spin.

229
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,647
God.

230
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,150
-Wow.
-Yeah.

231
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,318
-These are amazing.
-Thank you.

232
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,864
-And the nipples.
-I know.

233
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,699
I'll take two.

234
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,416
The total is $9,300 for the surgery,

235
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,501
plus one night stay at our facility.

236
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,212
-How would you like to pay?
-That's absurd.

237
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,757
I'm a teacher, not a drug dealer.

238
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,217
We accept all major credit cards.

239
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:18,930
Yeah, well, my credit situation
is a little complicated.

240
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,350
I'm sorry, but if you can't pay,
then I can't schedule the appointment.

241
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,395
I just reaIIy need some money.

242
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,441
As a matter of fact, it is about my tits, Dad.

243
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,695
Well, maybe if I had gotten yours
and not Mom's...

244
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,865
Look, I'm not gonna beat around the bush,
Grandma.

245
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,034
I'm dying and I need money for surgery.

246
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,581
Really? Nothing!

247
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,043
I'm rooming with a guy I met on Craigslist.

248
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,463
All I'm asking you for is $1 0,000.

249
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:56,384
You owe me for breaking off the engagement.
You know how humiliating that was?

250
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,553
Okay.

251
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,057
Lover, lover, look, I don't wanna fight.

252
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,976
It's only $1 0,000.
It would mean the world to me.

253
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,062
Lover?

254
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,564
Are you there?

255
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,484
Fucking troll!

256
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,111
-Did you call my name?
-No.

257
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:18,949
-I said, "Fucking troll."
-I thought you said "Kirk."

258
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,494
Do you have 1 0 grand?

259
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,579
Nope.

260
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,625
And, also, I might be a little short
on rent this month.

261
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,126
Like a lot short.

262
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,170
This might help.

263
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,676
-You wanna get wasted?
-Yeah.

264
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,302
Cool. See you.

265
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:45,767
We are in a state of emergency
and my word is Iaw.

266
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,478
There's onIy one boss in this pIace
and that's me.

267
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,857
The HNIC.

268
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:56,319
All right. We'll pick this up again tomorrow.

269
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,157
Can I help you?

270
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,045
What?

271
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,006
I'm the student leader
for the trip to Springfield.

272
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,884
-Shocker.
-We're having our car wash this weekend.

273
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,802
If you're around,
maybe we could wash your car.

274
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,305
I got some Mexicans
that already do it for nothing.

275
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:26,182
Well, the Springfield trip's
the best part of seventh grade.

276
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,977
Last year's car wash raised $6,000.

277
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,107
Bringing these magazines to school

278
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,817
is not the way
you're gonna make friends, Arkady.

279
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,360
Those eighth grade boys are just using you.

280
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,738
So I go now?

281
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:44,451
Yes, you go now, but if I see these again,
I'm going to call your parents.

282
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,660
Do you understand?

283
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:48,914
Go to class.

284
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,167
Hey, hey. Hey.

285
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:55,378
Go to class!

286
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,509
Another exciting day at the principal's office.

287
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,471
-Do you have a second?
-Yeah.

288
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,389
Oh, you know what,
I wanted to talk to you, too.

289
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,768
Did I hear that right,
that you were showing movies all last week?

290
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:12,354
Some clips, maybe.

291
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:16,858
But, you know, in a lot ofways,
I think that movies are the new books.

292
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,620
Is this new?

293
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:31,373
God, I love it.

294
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:35,460
You know, I've always said that dolphins
are the humans of the sea.

295
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:38,046
I have a bumper sticker that says that.

296
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,924
-No way.
-I'm not kidding.

297
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,134
It's on my car.

298
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:45,387
Come on.

299
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:47,931
Hold on a sec.

300
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,107
His name is Simon,

301
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:04,239
and he lives in the Cayman Islands
with his brother, Ajax.

302
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,740
Wow.

303
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,076
What a great story.

304
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:10,912
What did you wanna talk about?

305
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,623
I was thinking
that I wanna get more involved.

306
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,042
You know, I don't know, something like

307
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:19,838
maybe supervising the seventh grade
car wash.

308
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,675
You know, Amy has been running that
for like two years.

309
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:27,429
Yeah, but she does so much already.
It might be nice to give her a little rest.

310
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,309
It's so nice to see you
becoming a real member of the JAMS family.

311
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,021
Just feels so good to help.

312
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,957
Holy shit!

313
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,626
All right. Let's do this.

314
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,434
Hey, Mr. Delacorte. Yes!

315
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,564
Hey, kids. Hey. Hey.

316
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:03,608
Hey, you better not take it for a joyride.

317
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,859
-Are you sure?
-I'm watching you.

318
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:07,028
-Miss Halsey.
-Hey.

319
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,947
-I'm impressed.
-Thanks. I've been working out.

320
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,115
What a turnout.

321
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,451
Oh, yeah, and the kids
are just having a blast.

322
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,120
Well, that's what it's all about.

323
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,955
God, you know, we should
go get a drink tonight.

324
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,289
I feel like getting drunk.

325
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:23,878
I mean, not "drunk" drunk. Strong buzz.
Still be able to drive.

326
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,713
I'm sorry.

327
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:27,882
I can't yet. I'm just not ready.

328
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:31,427
But, if you're patient,
I think I might be worth your while.

329
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:32,887
You're worth the wait.

330
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,056
I think so, too.

331
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,487
Shish kebabs.

332
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:01,916
Wally? It's Amy Squirrel.

333
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:05,962
Amy? What are you... Get out of here!

334
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,922
This'll just take a sec.

335
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:12,719
I happened to be pedalling past
the seventh grade car wash this Saturday.

336
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,637
Can we talk about this later?

337
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,682
"Later, we'll all die," said the gator to the fly.

338
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,268
What the fuck? What?

339
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:22,770
Just go.

340
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:29,319
Now, I don't wanna speak out of school,
but, from where I was sitting,

341
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:30,778
I think...

342
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:36,784
It seemed like Miss Halsey
was getting pretty chummy with the money.

343
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:43,458
Are you accusing Elizabeth of embezzling
from the seventh grade car wash?

344
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:47,837
Wally, we barely know anything about her.

345
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,298
Hey, you know what?
They raised almost $7,000,

346
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,008
so whatever she did worked.

347
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,843
Viet Huynh's dad called.

348
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:56,137
He said the car wash was a raging success.

349
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:57,639
And Lauren Rissman's dad called.

350
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,724
He said we should have a car wash
every weekend.

351
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:03,645
So instead of accusing her,
you might wanna ask her for some pointers.

352
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:09,150
Well, if those pointers include
wearing provocative beachwear for money,

353
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,778
-I think I'll pass.
-This is ridiculous.

354
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:13,821
This is the one place in this building

355
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,990
where I'm allowed
to be alone with my thoughts.

356
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,702
I only have this once a day. If I'm lucky.

357
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,039
Next time you accuse
one of my teachers of stealing,

358
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:26,000
you better have some evidence. God damn it.

359
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,502
We are done here.

360
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:31,673
All righty.

361
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,176
Have a super awesome day, you two.

362
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,851
Holy fuck, I thought
she was never gonna leave.

363
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,532
How are things going with Scott?

364
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,326
Jesus Christ, Lynn.
The guyjust went through a terrible breakup.

365
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:02,203
-Yeah.
-What he needs now more than ever

366
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,664
-is a friend.
-You know, I think that's really smart.

367
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:05,790
-Build a foundation...
-Yeah,

368
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,918
build a foundation
and then after my surgery, we fuck.

369
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,422
I don't know. I think love should be about...

370
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,216
-I gotta go, Lynn. Here, hold this for me.
-Okay.

371
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:16,551
Thanks.

372
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,390
Are we starting School Ties today?

373
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,314
Okay. Today we're starting School Ties.

374
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:32,317
Brendan Fraser plays a Jew. Classic.

375
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:38,656
-Okay, who has the answer?
-Here it is. Good luck.

376
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:39,824
Here "what" is?

377
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,285
It's the pre-test
for the state standardized test.

378
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,786
It was in the memo.

379
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,248
Yes, the memo.

380
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,589
Hey, zip it. Zip your shit.

381
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,430
Okay, look.
We all know that these tests are gay.

382
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,641
Hey.

383
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:08,478
According to this memo,

384
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,105
I'm supposed to give you guys
45 minutes per section.

385
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:16,819
Okay. Clear your desks, everybody.
Pencils out.

386
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,113
Begin.

387
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,452
What's going on with you?

388
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:26,704
You need a tissue, huh?

389
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:31,459
-She is such a phoney.
-Yeah, a major phoney.

390
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,420
Yeah, but she also cares a lot, too.

391
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,677
I love how his eyes sparkle when he smiles.

392
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,221
I wanna sit on his face.

393
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,181
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

394
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,267
-Hey.
-You are just making a habit out of this,

395
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:49,394
aren't you?

396
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,521
Actually, Sandy Pinkus
in the math department,

397
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:55,233
I guess someone slashed his tyres.
And his wife's, too.

398
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,443
That is awful.

399
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:00,905
-Lynn, will you go grab me some milk?
-What kind of milk do you want?

400
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:05,618
-Skim, whole, 2%¤, chocolate?
-Surprise me.

401
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,746
Okay, I'll get you skim. No, 2%.

402
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,417
-So?
-So?

403
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,294
Hola, fellow educators.

404
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:20,299
-Is everything okay with Gaby?
-She'll be fine.

405
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,177
I told her, "Gaby,
if you're not happy with yourself,

406
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,680
"you can't expect others
to be happy with you.

407
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,682
"It starts with you."

408
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,559
-I'm sure she appreciated that.
-Yeah.

409
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,812
And it's exactly what I told Elizabeth

410
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,648
when she told me
about this upcoming fake breastjob.

411
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,572
Sorry. Sorry, I thought
you were telling everyone.

412
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,283
-Did you?
-Well, I'm pro choice.

413
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:48,369
I believe everyone should choose
whatever makes them happiest.

414
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:50,329
Except abortion, of course.

415
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:51,581
-Of course.
-Obviously.

416
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:55,918
Well, it looks like algebra is calling.
I hate math.

417
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,545
-Wish me luck.
-Hi.

418
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,965
I'm a math terrorist,
with close ties to Aljaybra.

419
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:04,302
I have weapons of math instruction.

420
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:13,436
Here, I'll walk you.

421
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:16,606
-Man, everyone is so nice around here.
-Of course.

422
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,274
Hey, watch my quadrant.

423
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,694
Here you go, 1 %. Surprise.

424
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:26,908
Hi. My name is Elizabeth Halsey.
Any questions?

425
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:30,161
Hi. I'm Sasha's mother.

426
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:34,624
I'm a little concerned at the importance
you're placing on movies.

427
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,002
I was just wondering
what your plans were for the state test.

428
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:42,465
Listen, the school hired me
because I'm amazing at what I do.

429
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,550
I use movies as one of my tools,

430
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:48,721
but I also use a variety
of other multimedia techniques.

431
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:52,058
Listen, I could take you day-by-day
through my entire syllabus,

432
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:53,559
but that's just not how I do things.

433
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,689
So that's my spiel, as the Jews say.

434
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:03,194
Please, help yourself to some delicious
snacks and drinks in the back.

435
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:06,405
Class dismissed.

436
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,284
Excuse me, Miss Halsey?
Hi, I'm Morgan's dad.

437
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:12,912
Morgan.

438
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,541
Great kid. So precocious.

439
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,709
I just wish Morgan's grades would reflect it.

440
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:24,549
If I know Morgan, and I think I do,
Morgan'll get there.

441
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:28,177
Listen, I'm sure you have a full plate,
along with a rocking hot body,

442
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:31,013
but if you could just keep an eye on Morgan,

443
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:32,890
my wife and I would really appreciate it.

444
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,435
For supplies and whatever.

445
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,189
For supplies.

446
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,277
-You're Chase's parents.
-Hi.

447
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:45,861
You know, a student like Chase

448
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:48,781
would benefit so much
from some extra attention.

449
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,409
So you think we should hire a tutor?

450
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:52,952
You know, I'd be happy to do it myself,

451
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:58,207
but it's just so hard with a class
of 20, 25, or 30, or whatever.

452
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,126
To be a teacher.

453
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:05,006
God, it is so hard on my salary to have to pay
for my own supplies, and my fiancé,

454
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,591
he cheated on me with his sister.

455
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:12,513
As her personal tutor, I guarantee personally
that she will get an A,

456
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:15,224
or your money back.

457
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:19,312
Well. Say no more.

458
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,691
Make it out to "cash."

459
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,129
Is that true?

460
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,506
But when I go to my grave,
my head wiII be high.

461
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,926
There are no victims in this classroom.

462
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:14,367
Scott? Scott? Scott?

463
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,369
-Amy.
-Hi.

464
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,621
-Hi.
-I got you something.

465
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,707
What? You didn't have to do that.

466
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:24,543
It's nothing. Well, it's my favourite book.

467
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:28,255
Eat, Pray, Love.

468
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,882
Yeah.

469
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,511
This is my favourite book, too.

470
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,389
What's your favourite part?

471
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:39,684
Love.

472
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,410
-What do you want?
-Is that marijuana?

473
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,747
No, it's medicinal marijuana.
I have a prescription and everything.

474
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,251
But I'm not gonna tell you why,
because it's between me and my doctor.

475
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,046
Okay, well, feel better.

476
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:10,715
Thanks.

477
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:13,217
My mom and I made you
some holiday cookies.

478
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,512
-Are those oatmeal raisin again?
-Gingerbread.

479
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,517
Let me see it. Have it.

480
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,185
Watch the bow.

481
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,274
Do you have anything to drink?

482
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,319
Listen, word to the wise,

483
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,364
stop dressing
like you're running for Congress.

484
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,659
I don't wanna run for Congress.
I wanna be president.

485
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,453
See, that's what I'm talking about.

486
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:42,788
Keep saying shit like that
and you're gonna get punched.

487
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:47,293
Do you really wanna be president
or is that something your parents want?

488
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,883
Look, you don't have to decide right now.
You know, who knows?

489
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:56,177
One day you wake up, you decide
you wanna be a masseuse.

490
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:59,638
Salary plus tips. Think about it.

491
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:03,851
If I think about it, will I get extra credit?

492
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,061
Hopeless.

493
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:11,233
All right. I'm high as fuck.
I gotta get outta here. Watch your feet.

494
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:33,255
This is indeed a winter wonderland.

495
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,554
-Wanna go get high?
-Yeah.

496
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,015
Give me a nug. I'll smoke it in my car.

497
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,476
Wow. No.

498
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:48,521
I meant, do you wanna get high with me?

499
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:53,442
-Eight, six, seven, five, three, oh, nine
-Nine

500
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:57,196
-Eight, six, seven, five, three, oh, nine
-Eight, six, seven, five, three, oh, nine

501
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:00,157
-I got it, got it
-I got it

502
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:02,868
Hey. They don't make songs
like this any more, right?

503
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,954
You know, that's actually not true, Scott.

504
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:10,709
I'm writing a song right now called
855-824-1777,

505
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,837
extension 777.

506
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:17,967
-So you guys having an awesome time?
-Yes.

507
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:21,011
Oh, my God, I love to dance.
I could dance all night.

508
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:25,057
-Hey, could we go somewhere and talk?
-Totally go for a talk right now.

509
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,105
What's up?

510
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:34,233
Okay.

511
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,528
I don't know how to say this.
I'm kind of nervous.

512
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,321
It's all just happening so quickly.

513
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:42,074
You can tell me anything, Scott.
You're one of my best friends.

514
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,368
I'm crushing on someone.

515
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:48,372
-I think you're pretty great, too.
-Thanks. It's Amy.

516
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,209
No running in the hall!

517
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:55,880
Kids.

518
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:58,257
She's been amazing
helping me deal with my break-up.

519
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,758
Yeah, I don't know her that well.

520
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,886
I know all the other teachers
really hate her fucking guts,

521
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,304
but I stay above all that stuff.

522
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,015
Can I be honest with you?

523
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:07,600
Of course.

524
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:13,647
It's nothing personal,
but I don't think that you're Amy's type.

525
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,025
-Really?
-Yeah.

526
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:20,654
We seem so, I don't know, simpatico.

527
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,032
How do I put this politely?

528
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,452
She's a lesbian. She hates cock.

529
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:30,915
She's only using you for your money.

530
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:32,917
What?

531
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,879
Well, I feel stupid.

532
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:40,716
No, Scott. Scott. Look at me.

533
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,302
I'm gonna get my breasts enlarged
in a couple of months,

534
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:46,555
and when I recover from my surgery,
you and I are gonna go out

535
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,016
and we are gonna find awesome people
for each other.

536
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,435
That sounds nice.

537
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,771
You're out of your mind.

538
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,315
There is no way
that LeBron will ever be Jordan.

539
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,108
Nobody will ever be Jordan, okay?

540
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,194
Okay, LeBron's a better rebounder
and passer.

541
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:03,364
Will you let me finish? Can you let me finish?

542
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:05,658
Call me when LeBron has six championships.

543
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,911
-Is that your only argument?
-It's the only argument I need, Shawn.

544
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,667
Let's get baked...

545
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,338
...goods. We're gonna go get
some baked goods.

546
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:23,926
You got this?

547
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,555
Just try it. Try it.

548
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,891
Please, don't... Stop pressuring her.

549
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:33,352
How does she know she doesn't like it
if she's never tried it before?

550
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,854
You know, we should probably
be getting back.

551
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:38,107
Just fucking do it. Weed is awesome.

552
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,495
-Hold it in.
-Just blow it out.

553
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,913
-Hold it in.
-Blow it out.

554
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:58,168
Okay. Lynn, I'm gonna take this.

555
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,380
I'm gonna go find a hot dog.

556
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,216
Shit.

557
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,594
-Well, that was deeply unimpressive.
-Like you can do better.

558
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,346
-Really? You sure you wanna do this?
-Yeah.

559
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:10,472
Gym teacher.

560
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,811
-You understand this is what I do?
-Yeah, I got it.

561
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,229
Like, for a living?

562
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:19,273
All right.

563
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:32,536
-You have no upper-body strength.
-Yes, I do.

564
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:37,249
Just not in my arms or my chest.
But I have cat-like reflexes. Makes up for it.

565
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:53,599
So, all this is mine, by the way,
as far as the eye can see.

566
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,310
Really love what you've done with the place.

567
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:59,772
Don't know if you noticed the nets,
but those are brand-new nets I had installed.

568
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,440
This is original wood.

569
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,901
See those championship banners?

570
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,487
When I first came to the school,
they weren't here.

571
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:08,781
They were over there.

572
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,241
I had them moved over there.

573
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:15,245
So, Russell,

574
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,414
what has to go wrong in someone's life

575
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:20,042
for them to end up
being a middle school gym teacher?

576
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,212
Well, granted, it wasn't the original plan.

577
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:27,758
As a young boy, I wanted to be a professor
of Physical Education.

578
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,344
At Harvard.

579
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,806
But I don't know. I like it here.

580
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:37,768
What went so wrong in your life
that you ended up educating children?

581
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,980
I don't know.
Maybe I was a bad person in another life.

582
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,528
We should, like, go have a drink sometime.
Together.

583
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,738
-Like over winter break.
-Nah.

584
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:53,700
-Got something brewing.
-Can I say something, for the record?

585
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,745
-Fine.
-It's about your, the...

586
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,959
The big, fake titties.
Are you really gonna do that?

587
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,295
Why would you do that? Your tits are fine.

588
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,005
I like your tits. Ask my roommate.

589
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,724
Seriously?

590
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:21,228
Fuck. Seriously?

591
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,024
Come on!

592
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,735
Seriously?

593
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:32,197
Hey!

594
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,700
-Why are they closed?
-It's Christmas.

595
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:37,494
Whatever. Hey, you got a lighter?

596
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,456
Hey, Miss Halsey.
It's me, Garrett, from school.

597
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:44,084
It's Garrett! Having a nice Christmas?

598
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:46,587
-Aces.
-What are you doing the rest of the day?

599
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,796
You gonna go see your family?

600
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:53,886
You know, I'm gonna go see some people.
We're having like a big potluck. So...

601
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,305
Miss Halsey.

602
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:58,765
Would you like to come
and spend Christmas with us?

603
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:06,607
Fa, Ia, Ia, Ia, Ia, Ia, Ia, Ia, Ia

604
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:10,777
'Tis the season to be joIIy

605
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:14,781
Fa, Ia, Ia, Ia, Ia, Ia, Ia, Ia, Ia

606
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,284
-Don we now our yuIetide caroI
-Deck the something eIse

607
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,704
We never remember it.
Every year we forget. What is that?

608
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:24,458
Listen, I'm really sorry I have to eat and run.
I gotta head over to the shelter. So...

609
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,212
The shelter? That's so inspiring.

610
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,297
Yeah. I really love helping bums.

611
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,926
But you have to wait for dessert.
We have a real treat.

612
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:36,428
Garrett, why don't you run
and get some of your new poetry?

613
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,805
God. No one wants to hear it.

614
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,726
-Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed.
-Don't be shy, Marbles.

615
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,979
This is called "The Chase," by Garrett Tiara.

616
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:53,278
"X-O, X-O
My love for you is X-O, X-O

617
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:56,823
"About her smile,
that I would walk a mile for

618
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:01,828
"About her personality,
that makes me see the best in me

619
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:09,586
"One glance, one dance
Because together, we can achieve balance"

620
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:11,838
Thank you.

621
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:17,678
I loved it, and I usually hate poetry.

622
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,514
Oh, Philip. "Hate" on Christmas?

623
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,183
Sorry, Santa. Sorry, Jesus.

624
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,688
Why don't you two give me a hand
with dessert

625
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:30,023
and we can let these two discuss?

626
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,025
Oh, fuck.

627
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:36,280
So the poem's about that girl?

628
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,031
Yeah, Chase.

629
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:42,703
If I could just talk to her
and tell her how I feel,

630
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,371
I know she'd understand.

631
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,208
Listen, it's not gonna happen, buddy.

632
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,336
I was that hot girl. Hotter, even.

633
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:55,048
And I would never have gone out with you.
And I'm not saying that to be mean.

634
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,466
I'm saying that to be helpful.

635
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:59,011
What do you know?
You don't even know our names.

636
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,137
I'll tell you what I know.

637
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:02,055
A kid who wears
the same gymnastics sweatshirt

638
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,349
three days a week
isn't getting laid until he's 29.

639
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,517
That's what I know.

640
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,313
This sweatshirt was my dad's.
It's all he left me when he left me.

641
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,356
There's a reason he didn't pack it.

642
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,151
Just saying.

643
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:19,406
Welcome to the number one
New Year's Eve party in the entire worId.

644
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:22,326
This is IiteraIIy the biggest party on Earth.

645
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:23,910
Aren't you going out with the other nurses?

646
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:26,580
I'm not a nurse.

647
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:28,540
I thought you were a nurse.

648
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:30,500
I'm a teacher.

649
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:42,429
...LioneI Richie, so don't even think about
going anywhere eIse.

650
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:43,847
We'll have the Jonas Brothers.

651
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,372
Hey. Welcome back.

652
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:13,543
Bunch of us are going out tonight to see
Period 5 play. Do you wanna come?

653
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,546
-Period 5?
-Yeah, the teacher band.

654
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,800
I'd rather get shot in the face.

655
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,305
-Hey.
-Hey.

656
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:28,100
So are you guys
coming to the Palace tonight?

657
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:31,645
-My band's gonna do a few songs.
-You're in Period 5?

658
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:35,065
You're looking at the new rhythm guitarist
and backup vocalist.

659
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,317
-Should be fun.
-Should be amazing.

660
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,404
-Lynn, you wanna come?
-Yes, yes.

661
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:44,282
A IuIIaby. I said...

662
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:48,495
Everything gonna be aII right

663
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:52,666
Rockabye, rockabye

664
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:58,004
Everything gonna be aII right

665
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:02,342
Rockabye, rockabye

666
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:04,094
Rockabye

667
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,348
Lot of cute guys.

668
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:13,353
-You should go talk to someone, Lynn.
-I'm fine here. I'm fine.

669
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:16,022
Come on, Lynn.
You need to loosen up and live a little.

670
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,691
When was the last time
you had a good dicking?

671
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,317
"A good dicking."

672
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:24,114
-Look, go talk to those guys over there.
-In the cowboy hats?

673
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,782
-Yeah.
-What?

674
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,285
-Oh, come on.
-You come on.

675
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:31,371
-Now, go talk to them.
-What am I gonna talk about?

676
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:33,290
It doesn't matter, Lynn.

677
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:36,626
Look, you go and you start with one of them,
then you start talking to the other one,

678
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:40,046
and then you go back to the first one
but still be touching the other one,

679
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:42,215
and then you just choose. Textbook.

680
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:45,385
Yeah. From the world's weirdest textbook.

681
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:48,388
-Let me finish my drink.
-Now, Lynn.

682
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:49,890
-In a second.
-No, go.

683
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:52,642
-I like it here.
-It is really fun over here.

684
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:55,312
Lynn. Get your ass over to those cowboys.

685
00:46:56,856 --> 00:47:00,192
Well, I'm glad I wore my fun underwear.

686
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:01,568
Okay.

687
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:07,741
Everything gonna be aII right
Rockabye

688
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:11,661
So, call me crazy, but this might be the best
Period 5 show of all time.

689
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,914
What are you doing here, anyway?

690
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,374
I thought it was poetry slam night.

691
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,752
I was gonna get drunk and mock them.

692
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:22,339
-That sounds fun, actually.
-I'll let you know next time I go.

693
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:23,924
Not that fun.

694
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,342
Okay.

695
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:28,595
Just so you know,
that shit does not faze me at all.

696
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:32,682
I'm like the fucking Terminator, dude.
I'm just gonna keep coming after you.

697
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,769
-Just so we're clear.
-Good luck with that.

698
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,232
Oh, shit. Check it out.

699
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,443
I'll be damned.

700
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,445
That shit worked.

701
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,864
Super fast.

702
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:58,708
Wow. Thank you guys for coming out.
What a turnout.

703
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:05,632
Right? I just wanna take this opportunity
to thank the guys from Period 5

704
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:09,886
for Ietting me join the band, and aIso, I...

705
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:15,141
I have an originaI song. It is my first crack
at song writing, so be kind.

706
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:20,814
And it goes out to someone very speciaI.

707
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:28,488
There was a girI I met some time ago

708
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,991
Simpatico

709
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:35,912
She helped me heal
She helped me grow

710
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,164
Simpatico

711
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:43,420
How do you know when you know?
I guess you just know

712
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:55,181
Simpatico

713
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:59,019
Exotico, erotico

714
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:03,481
You're my narcotico

715
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:09,821
Ask me how much I feeI,
I'II say, "A Iotico"

716
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:15,452
There can never in the world be too much

717
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:20,624
Before I met you
I was a ship out at sea

718
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,043
Fuck! What, is it me?

719
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,545
-No, I...
-I mean, is there something wrong with me?

720
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,882
I don't think so.
I mean, sometimes, you talk to people in a...

721
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:30,967
-Thank you.
-Forget him.

722
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,386
At least now you can stop
worrying about him

723
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,805
and be the best teacher you can be.
I mean, who knows?

724
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,307
Maybe you'll win the bonus.

725
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,727
Fuck!

726
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,313
-What bonus?
-For the state test.

727
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:48,568
Whichever teacher has
the highest-scoring class gets a bonus.

728
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:52,072
-How much?
-$5,700.

729
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,408
-Son of a bitch!
-$5,700?

730
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:57,327
-Yeah.
-God damn it, Lynn.

731
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,371
-You never tell me anything.
-Yeah.

732
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,253
Come on.

733
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,547
Come on, come on, come on.

734
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:13,510
Let's go, we have a lot to go over.
Everybody sit down. Come on.

735
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:15,553
Where's the TV?

736
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,265
Now, everybody, open your
To KiII a Mockingbirds to page one.

737
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,352
Good.

738
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:24,938
Now who can tell me why Jem cries

739
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,940
when the hole in the tree
is filled with cement?

740
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,067
Because she's a cry-baby?

741
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:31,778
Get out.

742
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:37,450
We're here to learn.

743
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:40,120
Anybody else have a problem with that?

744
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,541
Good. Now, who has the answer
to my question?

745
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,628
Nobody's read this book?

746
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:51,214
It's on the syllabus.

747
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:54,551
-Well, you never assigned it to us.
-Well, now I am.

748
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,636
And we have a quiz tomorrow.

749
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:57,804
-What?
-What?

750
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,305
On the first hundred pages.

751
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:06,938
You can't do that.
I have band and jazz band tonight.

752
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:08,732
We haven't had homework all year.

753
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:16,156
Things are about to change around here.
Recess is over.

754
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,325
Because birds symbolise freedom?

755
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,245
Good. Good, okay.

756
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,748
Does anyone have anything
to add to what that girl just said?

757
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:31,671
So, what are the limitations
of having Scout as the narrator?

758
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:35,967
-You, Chubs.
-Because he...

759
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,182
Focus. You know this shit. Come on.

760
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,100
Okay, go.

761
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,939
Don't flinch. Seriously.

762
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:51,441
You and you, hold his arms down.

763
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,195
Next question. Come on.

764
00:51:55,654 --> 00:52:00,533
Because Atticus is always
the voice of reason and justice?

765
00:52:02,495 --> 00:52:04,037
Correct. Here.

766
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,664
Nothing in the face.

767
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:10,210
Wait.

768
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:14,130
Miss Halsey. Really?

769
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,216
Wow. I never.

770
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,468
-We're in the middle of a lesson.
-Wow.

771
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:23,223
Twilight, look at me.
What did we talk about in class?

772
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:28,311
Your weight should be evenly distributed.
You gotta throw off the back foot.

773
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:31,231
Don't throw at her, throw through her.

774
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:32,732
-Hit her.
-Hit her.

775
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:35,068
Nail her.

776
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:39,739
Hey, what do you think of me
with Jessica Simpson's tits?

777
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:41,199
Go bigger.

778
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:45,537
What do you think of me
with Pamela Anderson's tits?

779
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,413
Go bigger.

780
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:55,922
It's just so funny, 'cause I...
I love raisins, and he hates raisins.

781
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,507
Yin and yang.

782
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,509
You guys are so cute.

783
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:02,679
So cute. It's like too cute, almost.

784
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:05,181
Last weekend, we went for a drive.

785
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,602
We had no idea where we were going.

786
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,104
We left the maps at home.

787
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,439
What? No way!

788
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:16,234
It was fine. I have a GPS navi system.

789
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:18,111
Thank God.

790
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:22,282
And we discovered
this new Ethiopian restaurant.

791
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:25,285
They finally got their own cuisine. Progress.

792
00:53:28,873 --> 00:53:31,457
-Hey, Miss Halsey.
-Hey.

793
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:34,502
Your shirt's mis-buttoned.
Her shirt's mis-buttoned.

794
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:39,465
-Thank you, Amy, for pointing that out.
-You're so welcome.

795
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:43,011
God, I've just been...
Been such a mess this week, you know.

796
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:44,971
Just working myself to the bone.

797
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:47,515
Yeah. It's been quite a change.

798
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:49,976
-Well, I think it's great.
-Yeah, it's great.

799
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:52,770
I just love people who are so passionate
about what they do.

800
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:54,397
It's so inspirational.

801
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:55,982
Thanks.

802
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:59,027
Yeah, you know, some teachers just sail by
doing that bare-minimum thing?

803
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:00,695
I don't know, it's just not me.

804
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:04,532
It's good to know
there's still some actual educators out there.

805
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:08,745
What else, Sasha?

806
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,872
I think I've told you everything.

807
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,707
Anyone know where Daddy Warbucks is?

808
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:16,252
-No more movies in class?
-No. We're actually learning.

809
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,088
Hey, did you know that Animal Farm
isn't even really about animals?

810
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:23,843
Animal Farm?
Sasha, that's not even on the syllabus.

811
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:26,763
Yeah. I know you're forgetting something.

812
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:31,351
You want extra credit on your diorama
or not?

813
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:33,394
-I do, I want it.
-Okay, think.

814
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:35,271
Let me think.

815
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:37,815
-Well, there was...
-What?

816
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,442
-Never mind.
-What?

817
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,277
Well, it was okay. It was medicinal.

818
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:49,369
And if she claims it's "medicinal",
I would demand to see a prescription.

819
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,287
That's what I would do if I were you, Wally.

820
00:54:51,747 --> 00:54:55,375
Do you have any proof other than
what one student thought she saw?

821
00:54:56,126 --> 00:55:01,381
Wall, this one student is in line to be editor
of The DaiIy Musket nextyear.

822
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,300
She's got a lot to lose going public with this.

823
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:07,470
If the Teachers' Union found out
that I was administering a drug test

824
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:11,391
to a teacher with this little proof,
they would make my life a living hell, Amy.

825
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:13,309
So we're just gonna let her walk free?

826
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,188
That's it? That's bonkers!

827
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:19,983
Ame, Amy.

828
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:24,028
Amy, stop that. Stop it.

829
00:55:24,113 --> 00:55:25,780
Sorry. Sorry.

830
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:27,115
Sit down.

831
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:30,535
Amy,

832
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:34,831
do you see this beautiful, little,
glass dolphin figurine?

833
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:36,666
Look at it.

834
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:39,293
-Yep.
-Look at it.

835
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:40,837
I'm looking at it.

836
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,630
Elizabeth gave this to me.

837
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,884
She is a thoughtful young woman,
and she is teaching for all the right reasons.

838
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:48,219
Wally!

839
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:53,141
Can't you see she is manipulating you
through the use of dolphins?

840
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:56,060
No, what I see is that you are getting
worked up.

841
00:55:56,311 --> 00:56:01,524
And what I would hate to see
is for you to get overwhelmed,

842
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:04,360
like you did in 2008.

843
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,531
Got you. Thanks, Wally, for bringing that up.

844
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:12,076
Forgotten all about that.

845
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,373
Don't do that with your mouth.

846
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:20,793
Regular mouth.

847
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:33,056
Atticus Finch is a good Iawyer
because he's a good person who's a Iawyer.

848
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:39,729
Stupid point. Misspelled.

849
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,904
Is this EngIish?

850
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:58,706
Are you fucking kidding me?

851
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:02,627
Pathetic.

852
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:06,172
This is why the Japs are overtaking us.
And, believe me, I don't mean you.

853
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,468
But we're working really hard.

854
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:15,139
You're not working hard enough.
I need results.

855
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:16,599
Class dismissed.

856
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:29,695
I need that test.

857
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:39,497
Hey, it's EIizabeth HaIsey.

858
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:41,958
UnfortunateIy, I'm not
gonna make it in today.

859
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,376
Tom Sawyer!

860
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:47,839
My grandmother took a turn for the worse
and it Iooks Iike she's dead,

861
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:50,883
so I'm offto the funeral. Wish me luck.

862
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:53,845
Yo, Bitch Tits.

863
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:57,181
I'm not gonna ask you again, dude.
I need those coupons mailed today.

864
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,225
Consider it already done.

865
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,437
-Hi.
-Back here. Come on.

866
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:10,069
This is GHB.
You take one capful before you go to sleep.

867
00:58:10,279 --> 00:58:13,447
And you won't believe the difference
it'll make in your workouts.

868
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:16,534
-You'll look even more amazing.
-What are the side effects?

869
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:19,704
Diarrhoea, heart palpitations, nothing major.

870
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:22,790
Just don't take it during the day,
you'll be out like a light.

871
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:25,084
Out like a light.

872
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:27,503
Hey, Bitch Tits,
you send out those coupons?

873
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,881
I was not told about any coupons.

874
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,634
Well, I can't wait to get buff.

875
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:37,513
How about you send me some JPEGs,
so I can monitor your progress?

876
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:38,890
You got it, boss.

877
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:43,060
Good afternoon,
lllinois Standardized Testing.

878
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:44,437
How may I direct your caII?

879
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:48,357
Hi, my name is Marjorie Goodman
and l'm calling from The Chicago Tribune.

880
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:50,568
Who couId I speak to regarding

881
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:53,988
the aIIegations of raciaI bias
on your standardized tests?

882
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,032
Please hold.

883
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:07,710
Marjorie?

884
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:09,879
You must be Carl.

885
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:13,174
Thank you for meeting me
on such short notice.

886
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,926
Of course. Sure.

887
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,679
Hey. So did you find the place okay?
It was a good drive?

888
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:19,805
Great drive.

889
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:22,808
Listen, Carl, I know
that you're a very busy man,

890
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,852
so I'm just gonna get right down to it.

891
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:29,941
I've been speaking to various black citizens

892
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:34,528
who allege that your tests are biased
towards white people and Orientals.

893
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,198
Okay. Let me tell you something right away.

894
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:39,575
A, Orientals test better.

895
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:44,830
B, every couple of years,
we get these cockamamie charges

896
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,707
coming in from various parts of the state.
Let me...

897
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:48,834
You should hear the things that they call me.

898
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:52,964
Racist, I'm fagatron, I'm faggy Hitler,
dick-breath.

899
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:56,175
Okay? But I am not a racist.

900
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:59,470
I voted for Obama.
You can quote me on that in your article.

901
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:01,264
You know what I think would help, Carl?

902
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:04,475
For me to see one of this year's tests.

903
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:07,728
Sure, I can get you one easy. No problem.

904
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,188
Great. Great.

905
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:11,524
On the day after the schools
administer them,

906
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,609
I will shoot one right over to you.

907
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:16,904
I was hoping to see it sooner.
I'm on a bit of a deadline.

908
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:19,824
So, no, that is absolutely classified, unless...

909
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:22,159
Unless you have one of these bad boys
right here.

910
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:24,954
Wow. You know, Carl?

911
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:28,332
Enough business for one night.
Don't you think?

912
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:29,834
Tell me about it. Yeah.

913
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:32,420
I think I'm gonna have another drink
before I hit the road.

914
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:36,465
You know, it's like the freedom
and the wind in your hair, and the...

915
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,676
Obviously, the image that I wanna...

916
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,221
But then the other side is, like,
mopeds are scary, so I...

917
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:45,141
-Count me out.
-But you seem like such a wild man, Carl.

918
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:46,434
Yeah, I mean...

919
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:49,937
What turns you on, Carl?

920
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:53,691
Everything.

921
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:55,818
You wanna know what turns me on?

922
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,612
Sex in an office.

923
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:02,158
Getting fucked really hard
against a wooden desk.

924
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:05,953
Mine's metal.

925
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:07,330
Even better.

926
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,584
And voilà. So...

927
01:01:14,755 --> 01:01:15,963
This is the desk.

928
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:18,924
Do you have anything to drink?

929
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:22,303
Yes, I do.

930
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,015
Voilà!

931
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:29,894
White wine in the office. Bad boy.

932
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:33,564
-Do you have any music, Carl?
-I have the Internet radio.

933
01:01:34,066 --> 01:01:36,650
I love Internet radio.

934
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:41,238
You've come to the right place,
because I have that.

935
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:45,785
See, I am not a whiz at this computer here.

936
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:49,455
It's relatively new, and Grace, who is...

937
01:01:50,499 --> 01:01:53,334
...works with me on Mondays
and Wednesdays, and Thursdays,

938
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,961
and I share her with Greg across the way.

939
01:01:56,505 --> 01:01:59,548
Greg, across the hall, is actually the guy
who got me into spinning.

940
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:01,258
Oh, here we go.

941
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,056
Shall we toast?

942
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:10,142
-To new friends.
-And new lovers.

943
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:29,537
-I'm gonna take off my shoes. Is that okay?
-Whatever, man.

944
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:31,747
-I'm gonna go hit the ladies' room.
-Okay.

945
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:35,376
There's a handicapped one, it's way closer.
Use the handicapped one, it's way closer.

946
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,948
-I took off my shoes.
-Carl.

947
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:08,993
I wanna fuck you up against the desk.

948
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,911
I wanna fuck you against the desk!

949
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:13,581
Carl, I'm gonna need you to pass
the fuck out.

950
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:19,753
Marjorie. I am going to rock your vagina.

951
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:26,802
That wine is good. Marjorie, let's do this.

952
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:28,596
Fuck me.

953
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:36,812
Hello, titties.

954
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:44,028
If anyone has any information
regarding the missing Annie wig,

955
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:46,155
please let me know ASAP.

956
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:49,950
Come on, guys. There's a wig missing.

957
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:52,745
Because if that wig isn't found,

958
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:56,665
you can bet your bottom dollar,
the sun will not come out tomorrow.

959
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:01,420
-Back to you, Wally.
-Okay. Thank you, Amy.

960
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:03,672
I'm sure everybody wants to get home,
so I'm gonna be quick.

961
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:06,425
Four score and seven years ago...

962
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:15,809
God damn it, Sandy. Sandy's so funny.

963
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,233
I have here the results of the state exam.

964
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:26,779
And I'm happy to announce that
the John Adams Middle School, that's us,

965
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,198
scored in the top 5%
of the whole state.

966
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:33,702
Nice.

967
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:35,538
Good job, guys.

968
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:39,208
And I wanna single out one of our own

969
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:42,253
who showed that
with hard work and dedication,

970
01:04:42,337 --> 01:04:45,714
one teacher can make a difference.

971
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:49,593
And this teacher is now $5,700 richer,

972
01:04:49,678 --> 01:04:54,306
with the highest scores in Cook County,
that's the whole county,

973
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:58,269
I want everyone to give
a big round of applause

974
01:04:58,353 --> 01:04:59,562
to Elizabeth Halsey.

975
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:08,821
-Well done.
-Thank you.

976
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,996
-Congratulations, Miss Halsey.
-Thanks, dude.

977
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,292
Well, if it isn't Professor Smartypants.

978
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:23,669
Don't mess with me.
I'm a lot stronger than I look.

979
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:29,383
Hey. Elizabeth, I am so proud of you.

980
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:33,137
I mean, if someone told me
at the beginning of the year that you...

981
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:35,306
You would get the bonus,

982
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:41,478
well, I think I would've said to whomever
it was, "No way. Absolutely not."

983
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:45,357
And now, here we are.

984
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:48,027
We should go out and celebrate.
Your treat?

985
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,863
Yeah, unfortunately, Elizabeth,

986
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:54,366
Scott and I have to go over the itinerary
for the Springfield trip.

987
01:05:54,743 --> 01:05:57,536
Yeah. We're the chaperones,
we're going together.

988
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:01,874
We're dating, so it'll also be romantic.

989
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:04,627
-How fun.
-Yeah.

990
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,086
You're not seeing anyone now, right?

991
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:09,423
Got my eye on someone,
but he's dating a major cunt.

992
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:15,220
-Pardon my French.
-No, no. She sounds terrible.

993
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:19,266
Almost done.

994
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,685
Okay, so that's endorsed.

995
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:23,562
And put the rest on these.

996
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,858
-Split it.
-All righty.

997
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:29,068
Book it.

998
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:56,303
Okay.

999
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:58,972
Take your seat. Thank you.

1000
01:07:02,811 --> 01:07:04,103
Who did this?

1001
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:08,273
Come on.

1002
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:10,776
No one wants an extra sticker
on their all-star board?

1003
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:16,031
Who brought you to me, Mr. Apple?

1004
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:22,204
What was that, Mr. Apple?

1005
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:25,624
You want me to take a bite?

1006
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:27,960
All righty-roo.

1007
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:35,592
And, Elizabeth, I just want to thank you
again for stepping in today.

1008
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:38,011
-You really saved us here.
-No problem.

1009
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:41,014
-Hey, is Amy gonna be okay?
-Yeah, Amy's gonna be fine.

1010
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:42,725
Well, let her know she's in my thoughts.

1011
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:50,649
Hey, Arkady

1012
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:52,568
Someone's calling my name

1013
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,403
Hey, Arkady

1014
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:57,865
-I dare you.
-I'm not afraid of your dares, Rodrigo.

1015
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:00,659
Do it.

1016
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:04,580
That's really dangerous, Russell.

1017
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,750
-I'll call you from the hotel.
-Bye, Amy.

1018
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:10,377
Yeah, she's sitting right next to me.

1019
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:13,380
-No.
-Thanks for calling again.

1020
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:19,386
-Amy says hi.
-Wow, she sure calls a lot.

1021
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:22,097
So, are you excited about your surgery?

1022
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:25,392
I've never been more excited about anything.

1023
01:08:26,186 --> 01:08:31,190
It's a pretty inspiring message to the kids.
We should never stop working on ourselves.

1024
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:36,612
Like you with your little boobs
or me experimenting with ethnic food.

1025
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:22,574
Gosh. I never lose my keys.

1026
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:25,744
Such a ding-a-ling.

1027
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:27,788
What's wrong with your face?

1028
01:09:27,956 --> 01:09:29,331
What is wrong with your face?

1029
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:32,584
Hey, I'm just trying to make conversation.

1030
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,921
-You're all done.
-Super. Thanks a bunch, Amos.

1031
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:47,057
I knew it.

1032
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:03,240
Well, that is definitely Marjorie,
only with kind ofweird hair here.

1033
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:05,075
In real life, she's actually very pretty.

1034
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:07,286
-She in some kind of trouble?
-Marjorie?

1035
01:10:07,996 --> 01:10:10,622
I think you're the one who might be
in some kind of trouble.

1036
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:14,459
Did you or did you not give her
a copy of the state test?

1037
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:19,798
No, no, no. Absolutely not.

1038
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:23,594
No, I did give her some quotes for her article.

1039
01:10:24,012 --> 01:10:25,178
What article?

1040
01:10:25,305 --> 01:10:27,848
Her article for the Tribune.
She's a reporter there, right?

1041
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:35,522
Test tampering? At JAMS?

1042
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:39,192
This time I have a witness, and, like I said,
Wally, she stole the Annie wig.

1043
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:41,987
We're dealing with a criminal mastermind.

1044
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:48,327
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, Wall.
You know how much we all love her.

1045
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:53,373
Okay, well, you know,
I have to call the superintendent.

1046
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:56,877
We're gonna have to crosscheck
her entire class's scores.

1047
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:59,838
This is a real shit sandwich.

1048
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:02,674
Of course, you know
what scares me the most, Wall?

1049
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,010
This is just what we know, right?

1050
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:08,347
Who knows what else she's capable of?

1051
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:14,061
It's so awful.

1052
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:23,153
Fruit Roll-Up?

1053
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:26,031
You know, when President Lincoln
abolished slavery,

1054
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:28,533
it was not a popular opinion.

1055
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:32,663
God, I just hate slavery so, so much.

1056
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:35,874
Slavery's the worst.

1057
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,420
If I could go back in time
and undo slavery, I would.

1058
01:11:41,673 --> 01:11:42,756
I hate it.

1059
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:45,801
Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt, guys,

1060
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:49,054
but I couldn't help
but overhear your conversation.

1061
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:50,764
Can I tell you guys what I hate?

1062
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:52,975
Sharks.

1063
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:56,186
Well, sharks can tear families apart.

1064
01:11:56,896 --> 01:12:00,399
-But they're also so majestic.
-They are beautiful creatures.

1065
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:03,527
-But they're also so ferocious.
-So ferocious.

1066
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:06,947
One of nature's cruel jokes, I guess.

1067
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,408
Okay.

1068
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:14,621
Thank you, Elizabeth, for listening.

1069
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:18,792
Scott, I want you to know
you can talk to me about anything.

1070
01:12:41,441 --> 01:12:43,316
Yourjeans feel so good against myjeans.

1071
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:45,652
Totally.

1072
01:12:46,404 --> 01:12:48,447
Hey, your body feels so good.

1073
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,574
I need some water.

1074
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:14,765
I'm dry-humping the shit out of you.

1075
01:13:14,849 --> 01:13:17,809
Yeah, dry-fuck the fuck out of me, Scott!

1076
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:19,144
Just stop talking.

1077
01:13:22,774 --> 01:13:25,484
I've been fantasizing about this
ever since we got to Springfield.

1078
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:28,278
-This?
-Oh, yeah.

1079
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:32,699
Me, too.

1080
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:36,161
I'm close.

1081
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,497
Don't move.

1082
01:13:39,499 --> 01:13:40,999
Here I go.

1083
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,043
Almost.

1084
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:45,337
Wait for it.

1085
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,341
Really close. Ready?

1086
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:51,843
-Yeah.
-Just stop talking.

1087
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:56,014
Oh, yeah. Almost there.

1088
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:09,361
-That was great.
-More like amazing.

1089
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:12,906
Well, I'm gonna get going.

1090
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:15,117
I don't want the kids to see me
leaving your room.

1091
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:16,576
Yeah.

1092
01:14:17,245 --> 01:14:18,370
God.

1093
01:14:19,539 --> 01:14:21,248
We are so simpatico.

1094
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:26,169
Maybe next time,
we can dry-hump without our clothes on.

1095
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:29,381
-I'm pretty sure I'd like that.
-Yeah.

1096
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:42,561
Even your forehead is sexy.
Well, time for bed.

1097
01:14:45,022 --> 01:14:48,441
-All right, then.
-See you in the mañana.

1098
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:53,405
Elizabeth, don't let the bedbugs bite.

1099
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:05,333
Hey.

1100
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:08,295
I was just going over some stuff
for tomorrow.

1101
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:10,630
Yeah, cool.

1102
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:13,884
I'm serious.

1103
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:15,385
Okay.

1104
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:17,721
Cheers.

1105
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,098
Hey.

1106
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:24,811
They forgot to restock my mini bar.
How's yours looking?

1107
01:15:25,897 --> 01:15:29,107
You know what, I'm super tired.
I'm just gonna hit the sack.

1108
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:33,778
-I'll see you tomorrow, then.
-Good night.

1109
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:39,117
And 17.

1110
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,746
All done.

1111
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:44,456
Shelly?

1112
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,959
Shelly, someone's got a message.

1113
01:15:51,631 --> 01:15:56,426
-I'm dry-humping the shit out of you.
-Yeah, dry-fuck the fuck out of me, Scott!

1114
01:15:58,304 --> 01:16:01,806
I wasn't always president. Oh, no.

1115
01:16:01,933 --> 01:16:05,894
I had manyjobs
when I lived here in New Salem.

1116
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:10,982
My favourite job was splitting rails,

1117
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:13,985
which is why they called me Railsplitter.

1118
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:19,491
Anybody know any of my other nicknames?

1119
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:22,160
-Honest Abe!
-Yes.

1120
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:26,831
Obviously. Honest Abe.
That was the big one. Honest Abe.

1121
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:30,335
They always called me that
because I said what was on my mind.

1122
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:33,004
Even if it made me unpopular.

1123
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:39,678
Remember, a great man always has
the courage to say what is in his heart.

1124
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:42,639
Yeah?

1125
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:47,310
I love Chase Rubin-Rossi.

1126
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:50,689
Great.

1127
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:54,651
Who would like to see
Mary Todd churn butter? Churn butter?

1128
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:57,862
I love you, Chase.
I wanna yell it from the mountaintops.

1129
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:02,325
And even though you pretty much
stopped talking to me in fifth grade,

1130
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:04,369
I don't care.

1131
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:09,124
I remember the Chase that wrote me a card
when my dad was overweight

1132
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,084
and had to go to the hospital
because of his heart.

1133
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:15,630
And a year later when he left my mom
and moved in with his trainer,

1134
01:17:15,715 --> 01:17:18,758
you wrote me another card.
What happened to us?

1135
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:24,222
Remember in the second grade when we had
a sleepover and you wet the bed,

1136
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:25,974
and you were so embarrassed?

1137
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:29,060
And you made me promise
never to tell anyone?

1138
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:32,063
Well, I never have and I never will.

1139
01:17:33,441 --> 01:17:36,735
So there it is. My heart on a sleeve.

1140
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:40,071
-Don't let me leave.
-No, please, don't.

1141
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:42,741
Always believe.

1142
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:45,744
Gross.

1143
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:49,456
Loser.

1144
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:51,750
-Dork.
-Hey. All right, guys.

1145
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:53,543
-Come on, settle down.
-Okay.

1146
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:56,296
Let's see how Mary Todd's doing
with that butter.

1147
01:17:57,381 --> 01:17:59,883
Okay, that's enough. We get it, you're crying.

1148
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:02,594
She just laughed at me and called me gross.

1149
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:06,056
Well, yeah, did you hear your speech?
Come on, let's go back.

1150
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:07,849
No. No, I'm not going back.

1151
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:10,268
-Come on.
-Just leave me alone.

1152
01:18:11,062 --> 01:18:12,103
Shit.

1153
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:13,897
Garrett.

1154
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:19,152
Get your ass back here.

1155
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:31,748
-We done running?
-Everything okay in here?

1156
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:35,001
It's okay. I'm his teacher.

1157
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:37,295
Okay. Take your time.

1158
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:41,341
-She's never gonna like me, is she?
-Are we still on this?

1159
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:42,926
She's my everything.

1160
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:48,681
Okay, here's the deal, man.
I cannot keep sugar-coating this for you.

1161
01:18:48,808 --> 01:18:53,228
This girl is never gonna be
interested in you. Never.

1162
01:18:53,312 --> 01:18:58,650
You clearly have a rich interior life,
with the poems and the whatever,

1163
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:02,237
but she wants a guy like Ian what's-his-face.

1164
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:05,657
Ian Mendelbaum, the rapper? He's an idiot.

1165
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:09,202
Yeah, he's a fucking moron.
But she doesn't care.

1166
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:12,956
She's superficial and her priorities
are all fucked up.

1167
01:19:14,959 --> 01:19:17,544
She likes him
because he's hot and popular, dude.

1168
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:20,630
You are sensitive.

1169
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:22,507
Yes, thank you.

1170
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:24,384
It's not a compliment.

1171
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:29,222
You have some rough road ahead of you.
Seventh grade is not your moment.

1172
01:19:29,807 --> 01:19:33,435
-Yeah. Eighth grade will be better.
-Probably not.

1173
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:37,897
I'm thinking college. That's your window.
Be ready.

1174
01:19:42,361 --> 01:19:45,196
If I go back out there,
everyone's gonna laugh at me.

1175
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:55,290
Maybe this will help.

1176
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:58,042
-What are you doing?
-I'm giving you a gift.

1177
01:20:00,504 --> 01:20:03,256
We are gonna change the news cycle.

1178
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:06,384
Trust me on this.

1179
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:12,348
-I thought it would be heavier.
-Don't be weird.

1180
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:14,392
And take this off,
and never fucking wear it again.

1181
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:16,227
What, are you crazy?

1182
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:23,735
-Everything okay with Garrett?
-No, it's not.

1183
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:27,238
I found him hooking up with
an eighth grader from another school.

1184
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:30,033
She was jerking him off. Yeah.

1185
01:20:30,117 --> 01:20:31,910
I'm gonna give him detention
when we get back.

1186
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:34,412
-That's probably a good idea.
-Yeah.

1187
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:37,457
Garrett probably made out with a kid
from an all boys' school.

1188
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,959
Yeah. And he was wearing this.

1189
01:20:40,628 --> 01:20:43,296
-What?
-Awesome.

1190
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:45,256
-Yep. It's real.
-Let me see it.

1191
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:50,762
That's a nice thing you did.

1192
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:54,182
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Really?

1193
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:57,602
'Cause I couldn't help but notice
that you're not wearing a bra.

1194
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:01,940
And those kids over there
are playing with one.

1195
01:21:02,775 --> 01:21:06,486
-Lots of people don't wear bras.
-Definitely. Lots of teachers.

1196
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:10,406
Well, if you must know, I was helping
a student through a tough time.

1197
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:14,661
I'm going through such a tough time.
Can I have your panties?

1198
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,955
I'm not wearing any.

1199
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:29,968
-Amy. What are you doing here?
-Scott, talk to the hand.

1200
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:35,974
-Amy.
-I know everything.

1201
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:39,352
Carl Halabi? The state test?

1202
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:41,521
The blatant disregard
for the school syllabus?

1203
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:45,316
And let's not forget,
the sleeping with my boyfriend.

1204
01:21:47,361 --> 01:21:49,487
Scott, your phone accidentally called me
last night.

1205
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:54,909
I can't believe you'd let her take advantage
of you like that.

1206
01:21:54,994 --> 01:21:57,662
You are too trusting.

1207
01:21:58,038 --> 01:21:59,163
I am.

1208
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:00,999
I didn't know what was happening.

1209
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:02,834
I hope you haven't spent that bonus cheque
or anything,

1210
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,294
because you're about to give it back.

1211
01:22:04,378 --> 01:22:09,674
And then some. Jail time. Jail time.

1212
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:13,303
-Did you ever think that maybe...
-Save it, doll face.

1213
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:17,682
You can explain it all tomorrow
to the principal and the superintendent,

1214
01:22:17,808 --> 01:22:19,517
when you've got your meeting
with the principal

1215
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:23,021
and the superintendent tomorrow,
at the meeting.

1216
01:22:23,731 --> 01:22:25,064
Tomorrow.

1217
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:37,869
I need you to go to this guy's office
and scare the shit out of him.

1218
01:22:38,871 --> 01:22:41,331
Tell me my mission again.

1219
01:22:41,415 --> 01:22:45,710
-Hand him the envelope.
-I'm gonna need a couple bucks for gas.

1220
01:22:49,757 --> 01:22:52,050
And a couple bucks for snacks.

1221
01:23:16,617 --> 01:23:17,909
Oh, my God.

1222
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:21,371
Sir? Oh, my God, are you okay?

1223
01:23:21,455 --> 01:23:24,957
-I think I fucked up my knee.
-Okay. Easy, easy does it.

1224
01:23:25,084 --> 01:23:27,085
-Easy. Easy.
-Hey.

1225
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:28,753
Do you need an ambulance?

1226
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:31,214
An ambulance is not necessary.
I just wanna walk it off.

1227
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:33,758
Okay, walking on it's number one
worst thing you could probably do.

1228
01:23:36,637 --> 01:23:38,971
Please don't touch my mirror. Please, sir.

1229
01:23:39,098 --> 01:23:41,766
What the fuck? Who does that?

1230
01:23:41,892 --> 01:23:43,976
I'm a friend of Marjorie's. Yeah.

1231
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:46,312
A friend of Marjorie's?

1232
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:47,814
-Well, then fuck you, man.
-Hey!

1233
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:49,816
-No, shit, fuck you.
-No, fuck you.

1234
01:23:49,942 --> 01:23:51,234
-Fuck you.
-You like that?

1235
01:23:51,318 --> 01:23:52,527
Stop kicking it! Stop!

1236
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:55,279
You stop fucking kicking it!
Fuck your scooter, and fuck Marjorie.

1237
01:23:55,406 --> 01:23:57,115
She drugged me, and she stole from me,

1238
01:23:57,241 --> 01:23:58,950
-and she's going down.
-Let me think.

1239
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:08,292
Take it. Go ahead and open it.

1240
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:10,420
Open it.

1241
01:24:13,132 --> 01:24:17,593
Yeah, not bad for a camera phone, huh?
You can keep those, too.

1242
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:18,970
Fuck.

1243
01:24:19,847 --> 01:24:22,265
And I was never here, you hear me?

1244
01:24:22,766 --> 01:24:23,933
Fuck.

1245
01:24:26,145 --> 01:24:27,937
Don't... Stop fucking with my car!

1246
01:24:33,277 --> 01:24:34,485
They're ready for you.

1247
01:24:37,948 --> 01:24:39,991
"Learning is Fun-tastic."

1248
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:43,369
-What'd you say to me?
-Your desk.

1249
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:50,001
Yeah. I forgot that was there.

1250
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:53,129
I'm such a ditz sometimes.

1251
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:58,009
This is very, very bad, Elizabeth.

1252
01:24:58,135 --> 01:25:00,928
Incredibly, very bad, Elizabeth!

1253
01:25:01,013 --> 01:25:04,640
-Amy, you said you wouldn't speak.
-That doesn't sound like observing.

1254
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:05,850
Bring him in.

1255
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:17,570
-Mr. Halabi. Thank you for your time.
-You're most welcome.

1256
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:21,491
I guess I should begin by saying
that my statement

1257
01:25:21,575 --> 01:25:25,036
from earlier in the week was not true.

1258
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:28,664
What part of it, exactly?

1259
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:32,168
All of it. Pretty much.

1260
01:25:33,212 --> 01:25:35,463
I've never seen this woman before in my life.

1261
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:36,839
Baloney.

1262
01:25:36,924 --> 01:25:39,675
You seemed very certain
a couple of days ago.

1263
01:25:40,385 --> 01:25:41,719
I did, because...

1264
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:51,187
I am a casual drug user.
That's my thing and everybody knows it.

1265
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:56,692
So that explains me making
absolutely no sense.

1266
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:01,572
Thank you.

1267
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:05,493
You realise that ifwe find out you're lying,
you're gonna lose yourjob?

1268
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:08,621
-Plus jail time.
-Yes, I understand.

1269
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:14,085
I just don't want to see
an innocent teacher get hurt.

1270
01:26:14,628 --> 01:26:15,795
Thank you, sir.

1271
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:20,216
I don't want to see anybody get hurt.

1272
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:32,520
-What the hell was that?
-So there you go.

1273
01:26:32,604 --> 01:26:33,938
I guess that explains everything.

1274
01:26:34,064 --> 01:26:38,651
-Retest! Retest! Retest!
-Damn it, Squirrel!

1275
01:26:38,777 --> 01:26:42,113
I am not going to have a repeat of 2008.
Sit your ass down.

1276
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:46,617
A retest, Don?

1277
01:26:46,743 --> 01:26:50,246
Come on, do we really wanna tell
our young people that if they study,

1278
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:53,708
sacrifice, and achieve the highest scores
in the state,

1279
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:56,502
that they're rewarded with suspicion?

1280
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:03,301
I don't.
I find these kinds of accusations troubling.

1281
01:27:03,427 --> 01:27:06,262
And, quite frankly, reckless.

1282
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:11,851
I work my ass off for this school,
and I know I am not perfect.

1283
01:27:11,977 --> 01:27:15,730
But show me the perfect teacher. You can't.

1284
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:20,443
There are even teachers
in this very school who use drugs.

1285
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:23,362
They do. They do use drugs.

1286
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:25,239
-They do.
-They do.

1287
01:27:25,324 --> 01:27:26,532
They do.

1288
01:27:26,867 --> 01:27:28,326
Wally, do you remember how I told you

1289
01:27:28,452 --> 01:27:32,204
there are teachers here
who use and abuse drugs?

1290
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:35,625
God damn it.
And I'm hearing about this now?

1291
01:27:41,173 --> 01:27:42,924
What is it, Axel? Where is it, boy?

1292
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:44,508
No, no, no. That's my class.

1293
01:27:44,635 --> 01:27:46,510
Axel's barking up the wrong tree there.

1294
01:27:46,887 --> 01:27:49,096
Ma'am. Please, don't touch the dog.

1295
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:51,182
Your dog is mistaken.

1296
01:27:52,851 --> 01:27:56,145
-What do you got, Axel?
-He's not gonna find anything in here.

1297
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:05,529
-It's clean.
-I told you.

1298
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:07,406
Maybe there's a false bottom.

1299
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:21,170
That is not mine.

1300
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:25,257
This isn't even my desk. It's hers.

1301
01:28:25,384 --> 01:28:27,885
Don't worry, Amy.
We'll get you the help you need.

1302
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:34,058
-You monster!
-Lady.

1303
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:37,311
-Calm down, lady.
-Fucking damn it.

1304
01:28:37,396 --> 01:28:41,107
What the fuck? I stole her desk!

1305
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:46,404
You can check my urine. Check it!
Check my urine!

1306
01:28:47,406 --> 01:28:50,700
Well, it's been another great year here
at JAMS.

1307
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:52,743
With summer around the corner,

1308
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:55,329
it's time to say goodbye
not only to another school year,

1309
01:28:55,414 --> 01:28:57,581
but also to one of our own.

1310
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:00,292
Amy Squirrel.

1311
01:29:00,419 --> 01:29:05,381
After six short years,
Amy is transferring out of the district.

1312
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:07,091
-Speech, speech.
-Well...

1313
01:29:09,219 --> 01:29:13,431
Wally, thank you for those kind words,
and thank you all.

1314
01:29:13,557 --> 01:29:17,685
My decision that I made myself to leave
was super difficult,

1315
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:22,523
but when the superintendent personally
asks you to work at one of the worst schools

1316
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:26,610
in the state, well, you say, "Yes."

1317
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:32,700
And, boy, I am looking forward to bringing
my brand of zany energy

1318
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:36,454
to those underprivileged students
at Malcolm X High School.

1319
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:39,915
Thank you.

1320
01:29:40,959 --> 01:29:46,255
Hey, Elizabeth.
Listen, since Amy's transferring,

1321
01:29:46,339 --> 01:29:48,674
maybe the two of us can start over.

1322
01:29:53,472 --> 01:29:55,848
Hey, there. Scott Delacorte. And you are?

1323
01:29:57,309 --> 01:29:58,809
Leaving.

1324
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:16,660
Elizabeth.

1325
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:19,121
Here.

1326
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:23,667
-Sign my yearbook.
-Hold my ball sack.

1327
01:30:26,046 --> 01:30:31,175
I'm gonna write my number down just
in case you need a lift after the surgery

1328
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:34,595
orjust, like, an extra set of hands to make
sure the implants are settling properly.

1329
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:36,138
Thanks.

1330
01:30:36,223 --> 01:30:39,767
Hey, you're not gonna teach again
next year, are you?

1331
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:42,186
I don't know. It's the only thing I'm good at.

1332
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:45,731
I'm just saying maybe you should consider
doing something else.

1333
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:49,568
Like, anything else.
Like, any otherjob in the entire world.

1334
01:30:52,656 --> 01:30:57,743
You know, the two of us?
It's never gonna happen.

1335
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:01,288
-Clearly.
-I mean, how would that even work?

1336
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:03,374
Where do you even live?

1337
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,709
In some weird apartment
with some creepy roommate?

1338
01:31:05,836 --> 01:31:10,256
No, my creepy roommate moved out,
so now it's just me and the dogs.

1339
01:31:10,841 --> 01:31:12,299
-How many dogs do you have?
-Four.

1340
01:31:12,384 --> 01:31:13,843
-Four dogs?
-Yeah.

1341
01:31:13,927 --> 01:31:15,219
Four Dobermans.

1342
01:31:15,554 --> 01:31:18,139
-Any family money?
-Yeah, you bet.

1343
01:31:18,223 --> 01:31:22,601
We're talking like three figures.
Almost 700 bucks.

1344
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:27,189
So, basically, if I was gonna go out with you,
I would be making the conscious choice

1345
01:31:27,274 --> 01:31:30,943
to be dating a gym teacher
who lives in a shack with four dogs.

1346
01:31:31,528 --> 01:31:35,990
I prefer to think of it as two people
with amazing bodies

1347
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:38,450
sharing those bodies with each other.

1348
01:31:39,578 --> 01:31:41,537
Giving each other the gift of these bodies.

1349
01:31:43,582 --> 01:31:46,750
Anyway, actually, none of this really matters.

1350
01:31:47,586 --> 01:31:50,296
I sort of started seeing somebody.

1351
01:31:53,633 --> 01:31:57,761
Really? Congratulations.
I didn't realise that, so...

1352
01:31:58,221 --> 01:32:00,556
-Yeah.
-I feel stupid.

1353
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:02,266
-So...
-I'm just fucking with you.

1354
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:08,105
-I guess I deserved that one.
-Yeah, you most certainly did.

1355
01:32:08,565 --> 01:32:12,443
I think it's about time you realise
that the whole world doesn'tjust...

1356
01:32:20,911 --> 01:32:22,119
See you around, gym teacher.

1357
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:35,507
Hey. Let's do that again.

1358
01:32:55,862 --> 01:32:57,363
Hey, Elizabeth.

1359
01:32:57,489 --> 01:32:59,323
Hey, Lynn. How was your summer?

1360
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:02,952
It was great.
I went to the zoo almost every weekend.

1361
01:33:03,036 --> 01:33:04,995
Wow, that sounds great.

1362
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:08,249
You didn't get your tits.

1363
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:11,543
Yeah, I thought about it and, you know,
realised I don't even need them.

1364
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:13,879
Plus, they're really expensive, you know,
per tit.

1365
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:16,048
Yeah, and you gotta get two of 'em.

1366
01:33:18,885 --> 01:33:21,637
-And I met a guy.
-Tell me everything.

1367
01:33:21,721 --> 01:33:23,555
Did you find your Prince Charming?

1368
01:33:25,684 --> 01:33:27,142
Something like that.

1369
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:33,148
-Hey, you wanna grab lunch later?
-Sure, yeah, my treat.

1370
01:33:33,233 --> 01:33:35,234
You got it last time. We'll split it.

1371
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,986
Oh, okay. Yeah.

1372
01:33:40,907 --> 01:33:44,535
Hey. You in the cape. You're up first, let's go.
