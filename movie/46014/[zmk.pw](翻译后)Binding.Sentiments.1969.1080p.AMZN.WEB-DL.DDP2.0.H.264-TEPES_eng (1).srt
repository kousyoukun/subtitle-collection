dr. TIBOR BALASSA
1922-1967

10
00:06:02,282 --> 00:06:04,300
- Good day.
- Good day.

11
00:06:04,493 --> 00:06:06,212
- Welcome.
- Hi.

12
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,176
Dear comrades,

13
00:06:18,474 --> 00:06:20,583
We have suffered a heavy loss.

14
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:24,588
By a sudden and tragic misfortune,

15
00:06:24,781 --> 00:06:29,080
senseless death has robbed
us of our young, talented

16
00:06:29,672 --> 00:06:32,582
and highly esteemed
comrade Tibor Balassa.

17
00:06:33,383 --> 00:06:34,846
He was one of those

18
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:39,668
whose life and activity
nothing can make up for.

19
00:06:40,464 --> 00:06:42,039
He was an extraordinary man.

20
00:06:43,254 --> 00:06:45,953
A talented researcher,
an excellent economist,

21
00:06:47,513 --> 00:06:49,148
who knew no obstacles.

22
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:52,299
When he started to do something,

23
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,287
he fulfilled his task,

24
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:57,152
whatever obstacles he found
standing in his way.

25
00:06:58,195 --> 00:06:59,282
His friends,

26
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:03,902
acquaintances, colleagues loved
him and held him in high esteem.

27
00:07:05,223 --> 00:07:06,302
Comrades,

28
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,222
with deep sorrow in our hearts,
we now pay our last respects to him.

29
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:13,170
The sorrow we feel...

30
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,435
cannot be expressed by words.

31
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:19,417
Let us pay tribute to his memory
with silence.

32
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:11,110
Go on a journey, try to find peace.

33
00:08:11,303 --> 00:08:12,660
I'll help you in whatever I can.

34
00:08:15,818 --> 00:08:18,832
I must go now... but I'll contact you.

35
00:08:25,976 --> 00:08:28,360
- Bye.
- Bye.

36
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,765
Dark night...

37
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,501
Who could chase it away if...

38
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:39,450
Who could chase it away if it was...

39
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,567
Who could chase it away
if it was approaching me?

40
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:51,477
And the girl would do what needs
to be done if I asked her.

41
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,739
- Pale moonlight...
- Well?

42
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,440
- Do you want to go with your granny?
- Yes.

43
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:18,971
You can stay for a week.

44
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:22,085
I will call your head teacher

45
00:11:22,453 --> 00:11:23,787
and tell him.

46
00:11:24,177 --> 00:11:25,177
Thanks.

47
00:11:25,338 --> 00:11:28,338
István was here, but didn't want to
come in. He said he would be back later.

48
00:11:29,118 --> 00:11:33,345
When I finally let her go...

49
00:11:43,938 --> 00:11:45,663
Doesn't this music disturb you?

50
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:48,025
I've got used to it.
Does it irritate you?

51
00:11:52,623 --> 00:11:53,623
Thank you.

52
00:12:01,028 --> 00:12:02,190
Well...

53
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,762
I'll see you in a week. Bye.

54
00:12:22,512 --> 00:12:23,952
You'll go without me, granny?

55
00:12:24,148 --> 00:12:26,915
Of course, you can go, my son.

56
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:49,736
Bye.

57
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,485
- I'll go now.
- Bye.

58
00:12:53,618 --> 00:12:55,470
- Take care of yourself.
- Okay.

59
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:01,474
Bye.

60
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,250
Hello, mother.

61
00:16:49,428 --> 00:16:50,770
Did you not want to let me in?

62
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:51,966
Hello.

63
00:16:54,525 --> 00:16:56,167
I knew you had a key.

64
00:16:57,621 --> 00:16:59,758
I read in the papers
about father's death.

65
00:17:00,515 --> 00:17:02,083
I've been waiting for you to call me.

66
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:03,425
But you didn't.

67
00:17:03,913 --> 00:17:04,963
So here I am.

68
00:17:05,653 --> 00:17:07,189
I would have called you.

69
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,694
I'm glad you're back.

70
00:17:19,526 --> 00:17:21,286
Good morning, Mancika.

71
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:25,029
Good morning.

72
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,831
I'm so sorry, but I was very tired.

73
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,671
- I thought you were still asleep.
- Never mind.

74
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,063
What's the time?

75
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:37,066
I don't know, but it's rather late.
I'm done with everything.

76
00:17:38,312 --> 00:17:39,759
I got up late.

77
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:43,409
I thought I shouldn't come.

78
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,080
I tried to phone, but nobody answered.

79
00:17:48,365 --> 00:17:49,617
So I came.

80
00:17:51,163 --> 00:17:52,872
The flat must be cleaned up anyway.

81
00:17:53,158 --> 00:17:54,432
You did the right thing.

82
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,980
I'm sorry. I'll be off at once.

83
00:17:58,835 --> 00:18:00,184
I'll bring some coffee.

84
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:10,028
Who would dare deny
that we need this light?

85
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:17,056
To see her face
when I finally let her go.

86
00:18:45,781 --> 00:18:46,781
Thank you.

87
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:51,854
There was barely any green grass
in the square

88
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:54,973
A cigarette?

89
00:18:55,362 --> 00:18:56,362
Thank you.

90
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,860
I caught a cold there, I think

91
00:19:02,198 --> 00:19:06,358
I woke up in the early morning

92
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:10,302
I hit the road in the morning fog

93
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:13,515
Another night has passed

94
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,045
Remember, Editke?

95
00:19:16,096 --> 00:19:17,295
In '56...

96
00:19:20,178 --> 00:19:23,295
you stood there at the kitchen door
when I came and said...

97
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,675
"My husband has fled the country."

98
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,560
It's like he died, too.

99
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:35,597
Even worse...

100
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:41,478
Why it happened this way, I don't know.

101
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:43,478
It smells good.

102
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,165
It smells rich.

103
00:19:46,945 --> 00:19:51,025
What I had to do with girls.

104
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,787
I don't remember my husband anymore.

105
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:58,467
I often take out
his photograph and look at it.

106
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,945
I can't remember his face.

107
00:20:09,198 --> 00:20:12,858
Nobody had come to my place

108
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:16,407
You want to cry, don't you?
But you can't.

109
00:20:18,971 --> 00:20:20,045
I can't.

110
00:20:23,883 --> 00:20:28,174
But if I found her one day

111
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:32,040
The one I'm always waiting for

112
00:20:32,325 --> 00:20:36,855
I wouldn't believe it's her, I think

113
00:20:53,603 --> 00:20:55,235
Good afternoon.

114
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,172
Hello.

115
00:21:44,902 --> 00:21:48,990
Lenin: the new economic policy
and popular education committees.

116
00:21:49,177 --> 00:21:50,437
Page 47.

117
00:21:50,993 --> 00:21:53,108
"The new economic policy means"

118
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,460
that we replace compulsory
deliveries with taxation

119
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,422
"to restore capitalism to
a considerable extent."

120
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,220
Engels: On the history of criticism

121
00:22:02,413 --> 00:22:03,980
Page 225.

122
00:22:04,437 --> 00:22:07,357
"Concerning this misunderstanding,

123
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,884
what Hume really..."

124
00:22:17,472 --> 00:22:20,471
When I was a child, I would always
sit here and watch him work.

125
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:24,139
I haven't been allowed to
enter for 2 years.

126
00:22:25,949 --> 00:22:28,919
Nor have I. Except to bring him
his breakfast and coffee.

127
00:22:32,152 --> 00:22:34,274
You kept arguing for ten years.

128
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,594
I think both of you were guilty.

129
00:22:46,503 --> 00:22:49,052
Do you still live with that girl?

130
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:50,203
Yes.

131
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,722
We're together.

132
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,700
You didn't let her come to see me here.

133
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,150
I know that's why you moved out.

134
00:23:03,372 --> 00:23:05,337
If you don't mind, I'd
like to bring her here now.

135
00:23:07,618 --> 00:23:08,968
Are you going to marry her?

136
00:23:11,045 --> 00:23:13,288
No, not yet.

137
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,912
Is this the only way you can think of?

138
00:23:18,925 --> 00:23:20,700
She's still studying and so am I.

139
00:23:23,176 --> 00:23:24,803
Did you ever go to university?

140
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,143
For three years...

141
00:23:32,687 --> 00:23:33,962
but then I quit.

142
00:23:53,585 --> 00:23:54,657
Is this a bad time?

143
00:23:55,137 --> 00:23:56,137
No.

144
00:23:57,749 --> 00:23:59,092
Kati is here. May she come in?

145
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:02,005
All right.

146
00:24:06,438 --> 00:24:07,885
Kati, come in.

147
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:12,709
How do you do?

148
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:16,190
Hello.

149
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,824
Sit down.

150
00:24:27,887 --> 00:24:29,155
Shall I make a coffee?

151
00:24:29,425 --> 00:24:31,727
I'm taking sedatives,
I don't drink any coffee.

152
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:34,014
No coffee for me either.

153
00:24:36,053 --> 00:24:37,885
Mother, Kati has moved in with us.

154
00:24:38,597 --> 00:24:39,932
I have noticed.

155
00:24:41,455 --> 00:24:43,412
But if you don't agree,
we can both leave.

156
00:24:45,805 --> 00:24:48,520
I wish you did not set
any conditions, son.

157
00:24:50,515 --> 00:24:52,344
You can both stay.

158
00:24:55,618 --> 00:24:58,385
The flat and everything
that goes with it is yours.

159
00:24:59,321 --> 00:25:01,106
I've got nothing to do
with anything here.

160
00:25:04,658 --> 00:25:06,577
That's how you and father always talked.

161
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:09,945
That's yours, that's mine,
you did it, I did it.

162
00:25:11,018 --> 00:25:14,355
- I don't like you talking like that.
- I don't feel like arguing now.

163
00:25:15,068 --> 00:25:16,177
I've had enough.

164
00:25:21,195 --> 00:25:23,820
She knows everything.
You can talk freely.

165
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,970
I'm tired. Leave me alone.

166
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,980
We'll talk later.

167
00:25:40,113 --> 00:25:41,113
Very well.

168
00:25:47,636 --> 00:25:49,352
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

169
00:26:17,353 --> 00:26:19,197
- Hello.
- Hello.

170
00:26:20,821 --> 00:26:22,680
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

171
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,058
Go inside.

172
00:26:47,223 --> 00:26:48,970
- Please.
- Hello.

173
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,150
This way.

174
00:26:50,771 --> 00:26:51,895
Come inside.

175
00:26:53,928 --> 00:26:55,012
Good evening.

176
00:26:56,201 --> 00:26:58,295
Go inside, please.

177
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,220
What is this?

178
00:27:03,265 --> 00:27:05,402
I've gathered Tibor's friends...

179
00:27:05,785 --> 00:27:07,135
and colleagues.

180
00:27:07,886 --> 00:27:10,652
I wanted to see them all together.

181
00:27:12,245 --> 00:27:14,645
Who... is that Grey-haired man?

182
00:27:14,923 --> 00:27:16,370
The new deputy minister.

183
00:27:16,563 --> 00:27:18,498
- And that guy is the old one.
- I know him.

184
00:27:20,821 --> 00:27:23,060
- Is that Gyuri?
- What about him?

185
00:27:23,228 --> 00:27:24,878
Nothing. I think he's a chemist.

186
00:27:25,545 --> 00:27:26,545
Excuse me.

187
00:27:30,341 --> 00:27:31,268
Hello.

188
00:27:31,387 --> 00:27:32,387
Hello.

189
00:27:32,511 --> 00:27:34,138
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

190
00:27:36,028 --> 00:27:38,795
My condolences.
It came so unexpectedly.

191
00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:40,485
I read it in the papers.

192
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,667
How are you, Gyuri?

193
00:27:43,533 --> 00:27:44,785
Thanks.

194
00:27:45,017 --> 00:27:46,353
I've been working a lot.

195
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,167
I'm bringing up my sons.

196
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,073
What do you do these days?

197
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:52,390
I'm an engineer.

198
00:27:53,065 --> 00:27:54,917
Have you left politics?

199
00:27:56,268 --> 00:27:57,482
I'm an engineer...

200
00:27:57,933 --> 00:27:59,469
and very fond of my job.

201
00:28:01,623 --> 00:28:03,607
Why did you make them all come?

202
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,692
Do you like them?

203
00:28:06,903 --> 00:28:08,132
Not all of them.

204
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:11,162
Some of them.

205
00:28:12,115 --> 00:28:13,743
You didn't like Tibor either.

206
00:28:14,973 --> 00:28:16,682
But only since '49.

207
00:28:17,815 --> 00:28:20,200
He always pretended as if
nothing had happened.

208
00:28:20,395 --> 00:28:21,962
Though he knew lots of things had.

209
00:28:23,138 --> 00:28:25,141
He was going to be a great economist,

210
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,565
but he became a party functionary.

211
00:28:28,021 --> 00:28:29,618
Excuse me, I must leave you now.

212
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:33,436
You intend to go and ask everybody
about their opinion on Tibor?

213
00:28:34,284 --> 00:28:35,284
What is this?

214
00:28:35,454 --> 00:28:36,454
A test?

215
00:28:36,886 --> 00:28:38,038
Or just hysterics?

216
00:28:40,455 --> 00:28:42,479
They regarded him as a great man.

217
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:44,125
Are you sure?

218
00:28:45,262 --> 00:28:46,262
I am.

219
00:28:47,437 --> 00:28:48,437
And you?

220
00:28:52,027 --> 00:28:54,585
All right, I won't keep you. Go ahead.

221
00:28:56,495 --> 00:28:58,266
If you talk like that,
I'll send you away.

222
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:00,805
You wouldn't dare.

223
00:29:01,889 --> 00:29:03,336
There are too many people here...

224
00:29:03,892 --> 00:29:06,141
and you have always been
afraid of scandals.

225
00:29:31,267 --> 00:29:32,707
I can't believe it!

226
00:29:33,368 --> 00:29:35,497
I've been on sedatives for days.

227
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,737
I really don't know what to say now.

228
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,828
- Please.
- Thank you.

229
00:29:43,021 --> 00:29:44,558
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

230
00:29:55,735 --> 00:29:58,172
I heard the news in Rome,
at the Embassy.

231
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,314
Your children, your pension, all good?

232
00:30:01,507 --> 00:30:02,785
Yes, thank you.

233
00:30:03,228 --> 00:30:05,455
Come and see me one evening,
I'd like to talk to you.

234
00:30:05,648 --> 00:30:06,708
All right, I will.

235
00:30:07,353 --> 00:30:08,725
Ring me up next week,

236
00:30:08,918 --> 00:30:11,042
- I'm always in by about 8 o'clock.
- All right.

237
00:30:12,168 --> 00:30:14,162
I'm sorry, but I must be going now.

238
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,000
I'll take a French leave.

239
00:30:16,735 --> 00:30:18,108
Wait a moment.

240
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:25,554
I asked you to come...

241
00:30:27,545 --> 00:30:29,157
because I wanted...

242
00:30:29,945 --> 00:30:32,742
all of Tibor's friends to be together...

243
00:30:33,462 --> 00:30:34,797
and meet each other.

244
00:30:36,432 --> 00:30:37,550
I want...

245
00:30:38,112 --> 00:30:40,647
all of you to take a book
from his library.

246
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,377
Whichever you like.

247
00:30:44,517 --> 00:30:45,517
Please.

248
00:30:46,437 --> 00:30:47,862
Help yourselves.

249
00:30:48,373 --> 00:30:49,373
Come...

250
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:51,659
Come and choose.

251
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:52,852
Come.

252
00:31:10,084 --> 00:31:11,126
Mother, what's this?

253
00:31:11,893 --> 00:31:13,257
Mind your own business.

254
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,409
You must be very tired.

255
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:22,422
Don't worry. I won't hurt his memory.

256
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:25,702
I'm worried for you.

257
00:31:26,735 --> 00:31:27,753
Calm down.

258
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,233
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

259
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:57,340
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

260
00:31:58,262 --> 00:31:59,642
Good-bye.

261
00:31:59,928 --> 00:32:00,928
Good night.

262
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:05,338
- Bye
- Bye.

263
00:32:09,003 --> 00:32:10,150
Good-bye.

264
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:13,023
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

265
00:32:14,425 --> 00:32:15,685
Bye. I took this one.

266
00:32:15,878 --> 00:32:17,237
- Give me a call.
- All right.

267
00:32:18,761 --> 00:32:20,410
Calm down, try to have some rest.

268
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:21,905
Bye.

269
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:02,305
Do you mind if I call you Edit again?

270
00:33:03,835 --> 00:33:06,850
I want to talk to you and
being formal bothers me.

271
00:33:07,622 --> 00:33:08,622
All right.

272
00:33:25,906 --> 00:33:27,518
How are you doing without me?

273
00:33:29,723 --> 00:33:31,627
I haven't seen you in 15 years.

274
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,523
That's not true.

275
00:33:35,475 --> 00:33:36,630
It was just a week ago.

276
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,648
Don't be foolish.

277
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,925
It's been 15 years.

278
00:33:43,905 --> 00:33:45,270
I've forgotten you.

279
00:33:49,818 --> 00:33:50,860
That's true.

280
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,960
Because you've only ever
thought of yourself.

281
00:33:57,677 --> 00:33:58,847
Actually...

282
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,937
only the first three years...

283
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,402
- of the last twenty were good.
- No, that's not true.

284
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:08,572
You've asked them to come
because you wanted their advice?

285
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,672
Because you never loved me.

286
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,202
You were just afraid of me.

287
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:14,339
You have been left alone

288
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,999
- and are embarrassed.
- No!

289
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,865
Don't do that.
You have no right to.

290
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:21,164
You've staged this little play.

291
00:34:22,722 --> 00:34:24,702
The beautiful, sad...

292
00:34:25,161 --> 00:34:26,622
and honest widow...

293
00:34:27,778 --> 00:34:30,020
who's having a fit of conscience.

294
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,266
You wanted to live well.

295
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:35,015
In comfort.

296
00:34:35,796 --> 00:34:36,860
In peace.

297
00:34:38,586 --> 00:34:41,105
But you never achieved peace...

298
00:34:42,238 --> 00:34:43,992
because you're restless inside...

299
00:34:56,173 --> 00:34:57,538
I can't feel sorry for you.

300
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,085
I just wish you enough strength...

301
00:35:02,812 --> 00:35:04,087
to play the game to the end.

302
00:35:04,643 --> 00:35:05,700
Wait.

303
00:35:06,555 --> 00:35:08,287
That's István, my son. Present yourself.

304
00:35:08,678 --> 00:35:09,833
Don't you remember me?

305
00:35:10,013 --> 00:35:11,273
No, I don't.

306
00:35:11,461 --> 00:35:12,915
I was a friend of your father's.

307
00:35:14,538 --> 00:35:15,538
István...

308
00:35:16,075 --> 00:35:18,018
Tell him why you left home.

309
00:35:18,346 --> 00:35:20,065
That you didn't get along
with your father.

310
00:35:20,258 --> 00:35:22,020
Because you were always fighting.
Tell him!

311
00:35:22,342 --> 00:35:24,488
Mother, calm down. This concerns
only the two of us.

312
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,090
I don't want to bother you.

313
00:35:32,093 --> 00:35:33,093
I'll get going now.

314
00:35:34,035 --> 00:35:35,035
Bye.

315
00:35:35,377 --> 00:35:36,377
Bye.

316
00:35:39,982 --> 00:35:42,030
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

317
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,430
You're tired.

318
00:35:51,343 --> 00:35:52,897
- You'd better go to bed.
- No.

319
00:37:45,128 --> 00:37:46,500
It suits you well.

320
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,407
I like these very much, I just
don't know where to wear them.

321
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:56,034
- This one's not bad either.
- Don't you have anything in my size?

322
00:37:56,227 --> 00:37:57,787
There are a lot over there.

323
00:38:02,123 --> 00:38:03,123
There.

324
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:07,755
I have a white coat.
I bought it in Paris. Here.

325
00:38:08,483 --> 00:38:10,313
Too big for me.
It should be okay for you.

326
00:38:10,605 --> 00:38:11,655
I'll try it on.

327
00:38:11,843 --> 00:38:14,782
- What a fine textile!
- It's wonderful!

328
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:16,207
Look at these colours!

329
00:38:17,782 --> 00:38:19,710
Which shoes should I wear with this?

330
00:38:21,023 --> 00:38:22,652
It's your size, isn't it?

331
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:23,845
- Keep it.
- Not bad.

332
00:38:25,422 --> 00:38:26,667
I don't want any of them.

333
00:38:27,058 --> 00:38:28,400
These are not my style.

334
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,433
Silk!

335
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,785
I have a pile of sweaters there.

336
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:34,978
I can't accept them.

337
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,462
Then I'll throw them out.

338
00:38:42,139 --> 00:38:43,139
Oh, how lovely!

339
00:38:43,401 --> 00:38:44,854
It looks so good on you!

340
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:46,399
You think so?

341
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:59,985
Sweet Jesus, but where will I wear it?

342
00:39:04,561 --> 00:39:06,425
- This one's Dior, right?
- Yes.

343
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:08,387
Marvellous!

344
00:39:11,113 --> 00:39:13,242
Oh dear!

345
00:39:13,415 --> 00:39:15,058
All these beautiful clothes!

346
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,625
And the bag?

347
00:39:46,932 --> 00:39:47,932
Come in.

348
00:39:52,297 --> 00:39:54,013
- Good day.
- Hello.

349
00:39:54,736 --> 00:39:56,080
- Sit down.
- Hello.

350
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,535
My hat, you fool!

351
00:40:01,152 --> 00:40:02,240
Want some whisky?

352
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,650
Yes, please.

353
00:40:06,346 --> 00:40:07,690
Won't Kati come in?

354
00:40:11,536 --> 00:40:12,880
What's going on here?

355
00:40:14,153 --> 00:40:16,080
Edit gave us her clothes.

356
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,980
What's going on here?

357
00:40:24,098 --> 00:40:26,010
I'd like you to leave us alone.

358
00:40:27,547 --> 00:40:30,547
I'll go and see you when I'm finished.
I want to talk to you.

359
00:40:31,043 --> 00:40:33,282
I want to talk to you here and now.

360
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:37,694
Does that mean you want us to leave?

361
00:40:38,051 --> 00:40:39,138
Yes.

362
00:40:42,151 --> 00:40:43,218
That's nice...

363
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,215
- Bye, my dear Edit.
- Bye.

364
00:40:52,886 --> 00:40:54,741
- So long and thanks.
- Bye.

365
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,732
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

366
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,953
And now, leave me alone. At once!

367
00:41:34,507 --> 00:41:36,172
I want to talk to you now.

368
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:37,890
Sit down. I'm almost done.

369
00:41:40,853 --> 00:41:42,412
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

370
00:41:46,793 --> 00:41:47,857
I'm listening, mother.

371
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,478
I made up my mind not to accept
the 200 000 forint insurance

372
00:41:53,671 --> 00:41:54,694
and the pension.

373
00:41:55,373 --> 00:41:56,542
I'll let you have it.

374
00:41:57,226 --> 00:41:58,380
As well as the flat.

375
00:41:58,968 --> 00:42:00,895
I'm going to the ministry
to sign it today.

376
00:42:01,088 --> 00:42:02,430
I want you to come with me.

377
00:42:03,653 --> 00:42:04,653
I won't go.

378
00:42:06,728 --> 00:42:08,415
I've thought it over thoroughly.

379
00:42:11,176 --> 00:42:12,345
You have?

380
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,462
I don't think so.

381
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:18,577
I have nothing to do
with anything here.

382
00:42:18,758 --> 00:42:20,806
Neither the money nor the flat.

383
00:42:21,143 --> 00:42:22,942
Your father worked for all of this.

384
00:42:25,133 --> 00:42:27,367
- And you lived with him for 21 years.
- That's true.

385
00:42:27,826 --> 00:42:29,572
But we had nothing in common.

386
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:31,350
Except that he cared for me

387
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:32,782
and we didn't get a divorce.

388
00:42:33,075 --> 00:42:34,665
He was the one who was against it.

389
00:42:35,542 --> 00:42:37,260
That's your business, mother.

390
00:42:37,782 --> 00:42:39,402
But you have to see this through.

391
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,404
For the sake of my father's memory.

392
00:42:42,532 --> 00:42:45,787
For once I'll really
see something through.

393
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,244
I won't go with you.

394
00:42:50,408 --> 00:42:53,790
If you've kept silent until now, you
can go on keeping silent and endure.

395
00:42:54,473 --> 00:42:56,715
You won't give up anything,
I won't let you.

396
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,580
Calm down.

397
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,465
Otherwise you're free
and can live as you wish.

398
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,272
That's what father always said:

399
00:43:05,475 --> 00:43:07,792
"You won't get a divorce
and you can live as you wish."

400
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:13,550
I don't mean to offend you, but
I can't take your decision seriously.

401
00:43:15,372 --> 00:43:16,924
If you weren't strong enough before,

402
00:43:17,117 --> 00:43:19,771
how could you could live on
1200 forints in a rented room now?

403
00:43:20,589 --> 00:43:21,691
You have no trade.

404
00:43:22,847 --> 00:43:24,729
I don't think you could do it.

405
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,857
Concerning the ethical part,

406
00:43:28,059 --> 00:43:29,484
I won't let you hurt father.

407
00:43:29,979 --> 00:43:31,974
Because, unlike you, I loved him.

408
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,440
- You don't understand me.
- No, I don't.

409
00:43:39,418 --> 00:43:41,998
- Please, come with me.
- No, I won't.

410
00:43:45,523 --> 00:43:47,165
Then I'll see to it myself.

411
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:49,543
Kati, come on, let's go.

412
00:43:49,723 --> 00:43:50,723
Quick.

413
00:46:06,107 --> 00:46:07,395
All right, tell her to come.

414
00:46:21,033 --> 00:46:23,508
Mother, please...
would you come out?

415
00:46:30,443 --> 00:46:31,443
Good evening.

416
00:46:31,696 --> 00:46:33,228
- Hello.
- Kati's made supper for us.

417
00:46:33,421 --> 00:46:34,807
She's a very good cook.

418
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:42,602
Let's make up, mother.

419
00:46:44,411 --> 00:46:45,411
Okay.

420
00:47:11,593 --> 00:47:12,942
Cheers.

421
00:47:13,798 --> 00:47:15,111
Cheers.

422
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,737
Believe me, I love you
and I understand you.

423
00:47:52,778 --> 00:47:54,090
But now you're nervous.

424
00:47:54,862 --> 00:47:55,980
This, too, I understand.

425
00:47:58,605 --> 00:48:01,193
You should go to the bungalow
for a week and get some rest.

426
00:48:05,624 --> 00:48:06,966
I can't go now.

427
00:48:07,627 --> 00:48:08,779
I have work to do.

428
00:48:33,401 --> 00:48:35,440
A little rest could really do you good.

429
00:48:36,986 --> 00:48:38,292
Kati will go with you...

430
00:48:38,547 --> 00:48:40,219
- and care for you.
- Oh yes.

431
00:48:42,785 --> 00:48:46,227
I've got things to arrange here.
I can't go now nor do I want to go.

432
00:48:52,758 --> 00:48:54,805
All right. Then stay.

433
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,393
You do what you want.

434
00:48:59,676 --> 00:49:00,808
Here's to you!

435
00:49:53,498 --> 00:49:55,170
I'm sorry, but you have to go now.

436
00:49:55,688 --> 00:49:57,288
I had no idea you'd come.

437
00:49:57,481 --> 00:49:59,062
We ended up coming.

438
00:50:00,471 --> 00:50:02,970
- Are you going to stay for long?
- I don't know yet.

439
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,362
Never mind.

440
00:50:11,544 --> 00:50:12,742
Come on, girls!

441
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:15,210
But I hope you don't feel cross, do you?

442
00:50:20,115 --> 00:50:22,702
- Well... be good and bye.
- Bye.

443
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,479
Bye and thanks!

444
00:50:24,672 --> 00:50:27,052
- Thanks for everything. Bye!
- Bye!

445
00:51:45,893 --> 00:51:47,137
Good morning.

446
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,212
Just call me and I'll open it.

447
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,085
How did I get here?

448
00:51:57,467 --> 00:52:00,354
We brought you here last night.
István drove, but he went back.

449
00:52:02,792 --> 00:52:05,289
I'm here to care for you.
You need to rest.

450
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:11,326
I can't remember anything.

451
00:52:15,724 --> 00:52:17,659
We put sleeping pills in your wine.

452
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:21,395
Clever methods.

453
00:52:22,935 --> 00:52:24,682
Cleverly done.

454
00:52:33,403 --> 00:52:35,159
What would you like to have
for breakfast?

455
00:52:35,783 --> 00:52:36,787
Coffee?

456
00:52:37,245 --> 00:52:38,245
Eggs?

457
00:52:38,483 --> 00:52:39,483
Milk?

458
00:53:31,623 --> 00:53:33,160
We'll stay for a week.

459
00:53:33,663 --> 00:53:34,687
You're mistaken.

460
00:53:35,486 --> 00:53:37,637
There's a bus leaving
at 11 from the village.

461
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:39,670
I'll take the afternoon
train to Budapest.

462
00:53:39,863 --> 00:53:41,393
- You can't do that.
- I'll do it.

463
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:44,543
I'm pretty strong.
All the doors are locked.

464
00:53:44,736 --> 00:53:46,251
I'll follow you everywhere.

465
00:53:47,061 --> 00:53:48,703
So I'll have to escape.

466
00:53:49,514 --> 00:53:50,871
Very funny.

467
00:53:51,064 --> 00:53:52,144
You can't escape.

468
00:53:52,916 --> 00:53:54,324
Here's your breakfast.

469
00:53:54,517 --> 00:53:56,028
Why are you doing this?

470
00:53:56,812 --> 00:53:58,173
István asked me.

471
00:54:00,435 --> 00:54:01,506
Do you love him?

472
00:54:01,699 --> 00:54:02,699
Yes.

473
00:54:04,443 --> 00:54:06,100
Will you marry him?

474
00:54:06,648 --> 00:54:08,067
I will, if he proposes to me.

475
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,109
I'll get dressed.

476
00:54:22,493 --> 00:54:23,493
Come here.

477
00:54:24,996 --> 00:54:25,996
Come.

478
00:54:28,998 --> 00:54:29,998
Come.

479
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:47,597
Hello, Cili.

480
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:49,225
Is Cili her name?

481
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:50,981
Yes.

482
00:54:51,389 --> 00:54:53,430
What would you like to have for lunch?

483
00:54:56,018 --> 00:54:57,804
Thanks for the excellent waiting,

484
00:54:57,997 --> 00:55:00,697
but like I said,
I'm taking the 11 o'clock home.

485
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:04,842
You'd better not or
I'll have to lock you in.

486
00:55:06,545 --> 00:55:08,465
- Would you do it?
- I would.

487
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:11,586
So you would lock me in.

488
00:55:13,902 --> 00:55:14,902
All right.

489
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,849
Since we're going to spend
a week together,

490
00:55:18,038 --> 00:55:20,452
we could make up the
programme together.

491
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:24,087
- I want you to have a good time.
- Who do you think you are?

492
00:55:25,618 --> 00:55:27,259
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

493
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:29,190
Who are you?

494
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,707
And what have you got to do with me?

495
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:36,200
I'm Kati Csák, I'm a chemist student.

496
00:55:36,393 --> 00:55:38,120
I was born in '45 in Dorog.

497
00:55:39,485 --> 00:55:41,524
I don't think much of myself, but...

498
00:55:41,846 --> 00:55:43,391
I think you're afraid of me...

499
00:55:43,714 --> 00:55:45,387
because you're afraid of your son, too.

500
00:55:46,812 --> 00:55:47,876
It's not true.

501
00:55:48,364 --> 00:55:49,772
I'm not afraid of him.

502
00:55:49,947 --> 00:55:50,947
You are.

503
00:55:59,001 --> 00:56:00,001
Cili!

504
00:56:03,703 --> 00:56:05,623
That's it. Come here.

505
00:56:06,608 --> 00:56:07,608
Good.

506
00:56:12,165 --> 00:56:13,928
I hope now you know...

507
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:17,715
that I can leave if I want to.

508
00:56:37,713 --> 00:56:38,713
Cili!

509
00:56:38,861 --> 00:56:39,861
Cili dear!

510
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,374
Good morning.

511
00:56:44,578 --> 00:56:45,578
Good morning.

512
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,734
I feed her.

513
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:49,744
We live here next door.

514
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:51,569
Who are you?

515
00:56:51,787 --> 00:56:53,280
Kati, István's fiancée.

516
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,417
We are here with his mother,
she's resting.

517
00:56:55,672 --> 00:56:58,072
Oh yes, I hear the gentleman died.

518
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:02,956
- How is Edit?
- She's asleep now. She's exhausted.

519
00:57:03,149 --> 00:57:04,537
I have a favour to ask you.

520
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:06,688
Could you feed the dog
for one more day?

521
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:08,089
Why not?

522
00:57:08,242 --> 00:57:10,131
- Let her out.
- Thank you.

523
00:57:14,262 --> 00:57:15,979
Cili! Good-bye.

524
00:57:16,172 --> 00:57:18,136
- See you later.
- Thank you so much.

525
00:57:18,329 --> 00:57:19,329
Good-bye.

526
00:57:44,005 --> 00:57:45,005
The dog?

527
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:47,852
With the neighbours.

528
00:57:50,462 --> 00:57:51,583
Very tricky.

529
00:57:59,258 --> 00:58:01,350
- The gate?
- I've locked it.

530
00:58:16,355 --> 00:58:18,162
You'd even beat me if you had to.

531
00:58:19,306 --> 00:58:20,615
No, I'll just lock you up.

532
00:58:21,872 --> 00:58:23,567
Try to rest and don't be hysterical.

533
00:58:43,241 --> 00:58:44,241
Cili!

534
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:46,640
Come here, Cili!

535
00:58:48,732 --> 00:58:50,584
- Cili!
- Come, Cili, come!

536
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:52,735
- Is she your dog?
- No, my mother's.

537
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,360
Come on, Cili.

538
00:58:54,477 --> 00:58:55,662
How clever is she?

539
00:58:57,522 --> 00:58:59,142
- Fetch it!
- Come, doggy!

540
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:01,827
We're going to have a bath.
Jump, Cili!

541
00:59:02,967 --> 00:59:05,637
- Cili! Come back.
- Show us how clever you are, Cili.

542
00:59:06,275 --> 00:59:08,052
Cili... jump!

543
00:59:08,233 --> 00:59:10,579
- She won't obey you.
- Cili, jump! Hop!

544
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:12,240
She made it.

545
00:59:12,393 --> 00:59:14,240
Hop! Come on now.

546
00:59:24,006 --> 00:59:25,265
- Hello.
- Hi.

547
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:29,080
What's up?

548
00:59:29,303 --> 00:59:31,927
We almost had a fight.
She wants to leave by all means.

549
00:59:37,957 --> 00:59:39,855
I think we should stop doing this.

550
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:42,533
Just carry on.

551
00:59:45,475 --> 00:59:46,645
Shouldn't we let her go?

552
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:51,678
We have to carry on just for some days.
I know my mother.

553
00:59:52,496 --> 00:59:54,670
She's hysterical.
But it will soon be over.

554
00:59:55,307 --> 00:59:56,396
I don't think so.

555
01:00:25,586 --> 01:00:28,487
- Gáspár, bring that girl in here!
- Give it to me for a sec.

556
01:00:34,663 --> 01:00:37,018
Oh my, it's cold! But it's fine.

557
01:00:43,251 --> 01:00:45,470
It's forbidden to swim here!

558
01:00:45,658 --> 01:00:47,292
Come out and show me your papers!

559
01:00:53,238 --> 01:00:55,045
Come out!

560
01:00:55,338 --> 01:00:56,338
Hurry up!

561
01:00:58,427 --> 01:00:59,450
What are you doing here?

562
01:00:59,643 --> 01:01:01,862
- Is it forbidden to swim here?
- We're playing chess.

563
01:01:04,765 --> 01:01:06,310
Come on, hurry up!

564
01:01:06,782 --> 01:01:07,782
Come out!

565
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:11,154
The dog doesn't like it either.

566
01:01:15,973 --> 01:01:17,338
Get dressed, quick!

567
01:01:18,793 --> 01:01:19,793
Hurry up.

568
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:21,732
You, too.

569
01:01:23,987 --> 01:01:25,780
- Give me my shoes.
- Hurry up.

570
01:01:28,878 --> 01:01:30,514
- You! Put on your gown.
- Me?

571
01:01:30,707 --> 01:01:31,707
Come on.

572
01:01:42,606 --> 01:01:43,885
You look lovely.

573
01:01:57,023 --> 01:01:59,220
Look out! You're treading on my shirt!

574
01:01:59,663 --> 01:02:01,568
- Where are you staying?
- At the camping.

575
01:02:01,756 --> 01:02:02,971
Why? What's wrong?

576
01:02:03,668 --> 01:02:04,815
I know what his problem is.

577
01:02:05,002 --> 01:02:07,027
We have long hair,
we're hooligans, aren't we?

578
01:02:08,746 --> 01:02:10,025
Come on, put it on.

579
01:02:10,553 --> 01:02:11,833
You'd better behave.

580
01:02:12,026 --> 01:02:14,133
- We did behave, we just went bathing.
- I know.

581
01:02:14,298 --> 01:02:15,366
- Get going.
- Hi.

582
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:17,666
- I didn't know you were here.
- Take your clothes.

583
01:02:18,213 --> 01:02:19,237
He's my brother.

584
01:02:19,714 --> 01:02:20,714
Get going.

585
01:02:21,018 --> 01:02:23,216
- Come on, Gáspár.
- No, I'm going with them.

586
01:02:23,409 --> 01:02:24,409
Take that, too.

587
01:02:24,723 --> 01:02:27,235
- Let's go to the police station.
- Where are my shoes?

588
01:02:27,428 --> 01:02:29,515
Gáspár, come back!

589
01:02:31,351 --> 01:02:32,351
Come on, Cili!

590
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:34,418
- Stop turning back, go ahead!
- All right.

591
01:02:34,611 --> 01:02:36,448
- Let's go!
- Why do we have to go?

592
01:02:36,828 --> 01:02:38,290
You'll find out at the station.

593
01:02:38,486 --> 01:02:41,748
- You want to tell me how to breathe, too?
- We are pioneers!

594
01:02:54,617 --> 01:02:55,682
Lunch is ready.

595
01:03:04,098 --> 01:03:05,185
Won't you eat?

596
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:07,220
I'm sorry.

597
01:03:22,336 --> 01:03:24,390
Say, can you be hired to do anything?

598
01:03:24,818 --> 01:03:26,625
You want my son, you can have him.

599
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:30,354
Not only do I want him...

600
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:32,052
but he also wants me.

601
01:03:35,073 --> 01:03:36,468
Edit dear!

602
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:44,034
How are you, aunt Margit?

603
01:03:44,628 --> 01:03:45,702
Already awake?

604
01:03:45,895 --> 01:03:47,237
Yes.

605
01:03:47,733 --> 01:03:48,733
Good day.

606
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:53,103
I was told your husband died.

607
01:03:53,463 --> 01:03:55,113
Let him rest in peace.

608
01:03:56,006 --> 01:03:57,430
And how are you, dear?

609
01:03:58,323 --> 01:03:59,597
Thanks... I am OK.

610
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:02,034
Kati's got the key.

611
01:04:02,446 --> 01:04:03,446
Kati!

612
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:04,850
Open up!

613
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,095
Good day.

614
01:04:13,415 --> 01:04:14,945
My son's fiancée.

615
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:17,544
We've met already.

616
01:04:19,945 --> 01:04:21,850
When are you going to get married?

617
01:04:22,023 --> 01:04:24,040
In a year, when I've
finished university.

618
01:04:26,815 --> 01:04:29,320
My husband, too, died 10 years ago.

619
01:04:29,852 --> 01:04:31,794
He was a good man and a good farmer.

620
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:36,017
I was left alone with nine children.

621
01:04:47,561 --> 01:04:50,327
- Do sit down, aunt Margit.
- Thank you.

622
01:04:53,688 --> 01:04:55,082
Is she a decent girl?

623
01:04:56,709 --> 01:04:58,120
Oh yes, very decent.

624
01:04:58,313 --> 01:04:59,415
All right, then.

625
01:05:04,845 --> 01:05:06,975
Well... I'll be going now,
I'm very busy.

626
01:05:07,168 --> 01:05:09,259
Wait, aunt Margit.

627
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:12,574
I'll go with you.

628
01:05:13,729 --> 01:05:15,155
I'll take a walk.

629
01:05:23,176 --> 01:05:24,742
Don't go, please.

630
01:05:26,461 --> 01:05:27,638
Wash the dishes.

631
01:05:28,021 --> 01:05:29,483
I'll be back soon. Bye.

632
01:05:29,768 --> 01:05:30,975
Good-bye.

633
01:05:31,168 --> 01:05:32,168
Good-bye.

634
01:06:01,682 --> 01:06:03,055
I'm so glad you came.

635
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:12,178
Two of my daughters
will come from Budapest.

636
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:14,315
We stick together.

637
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:20,037
My four sons also often come to see me.

638
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:23,690
- We're rather attached to each other.
- And to money.

639
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:25,235
And to money as well.

640
01:06:31,261 --> 01:06:34,102
What would you have done with
the children parted from your husband?

641
01:06:34,298 --> 01:06:36,382
- We gave you a home.
- Yes, indeed.

642
01:06:36,586 --> 01:06:38,497
But I work like a horse.

643
01:06:39,315 --> 01:06:42,097
- Have some wine, Edit, it's really good.
- Thank you.

644
01:06:49,893 --> 01:06:52,247
I wanted to study,
but I wasn't accepted by the school.

645
01:06:52,526 --> 01:06:53,748
My husband is a locksmith.

646
01:06:53,913 --> 01:06:56,005
He's a drunkard, he'd beat me up,
so I left him.

647
01:07:00,041 --> 01:07:01,532
Why aren't you studying now?

648
01:07:01,725 --> 01:07:03,479
How could we manage if I studied?

649
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,805
Mother will find me
a vintner for a husband.

650
01:07:07,052 --> 01:07:08,687
- Won't you, mother?
- Of course I will.

651
01:07:09,767 --> 01:07:11,544
Have a drink, it's very good.

652
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:18,359
She's left with aunt Margit.

653
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:25,615
- We should stop this whole business.
- No.

654
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:26,845
She won't leave anyway.

655
01:07:27,197 --> 01:07:29,365
Walk over to aunt Margit's,
I'll come by later.

656
01:07:30,783 --> 01:07:31,783
Okay.

657
01:07:33,437 --> 01:07:34,437
Come in.

658
01:07:46,853 --> 01:07:48,278
And do you love me?

659
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:50,210
I do.

660
01:07:51,161 --> 01:07:52,240
I think.

661
01:08:00,346 --> 01:08:01,418
Have some more.

662
01:08:02,452 --> 01:08:04,365
You must be very sad now.

663
01:08:04,815 --> 01:08:06,127
Why are you sad?

664
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:09,645
Her husband died. A week ago.

665
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:11,888
Did you love him?

666
01:08:13,621 --> 01:08:14,745
She did.

667
01:08:14,938 --> 01:08:16,647
He was a big man up in Budapest.

668
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,777
If you loved him, drink.

669
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:20,600
The same if you didn't.

670
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:55,085
Stars up in the heavens
Gleam and glow and glisten!

671
01:08:55,482 --> 01:09:02,634
Show the poor lad the way

672
01:09:03,213 --> 01:09:10,322
Show the poor lad the way

673
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:19,190
For he can't find his lover's house

674
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:28,872
It's a beautiful lady I'm wooing

675
01:09:29,241 --> 01:09:35,675
To the ugly ones, I pay no attention

676
01:09:35,868 --> 01:09:39,522
Oh my heart, no one should know

677
01:09:39,715 --> 01:09:42,445
That I love that blonde girl

678
01:09:42,828 --> 01:09:48,190
Only the gypsy playing the violin
knows it

679
01:09:48,383 --> 01:09:50,200
Edit, what's your song?

680
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:53,222
"A road so wide..."

681
01:09:59,698 --> 01:10:07,698
A road so wide, a road so long

682
01:10:10,205 --> 01:10:18,205
My angel set off on

683
01:10:21,553 --> 01:10:29,553
My angel, come back
from your long journey

684
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:43,830
Remember your broken promise

685
01:10:46,295 --> 01:10:54,295
We cannot come back
from too long a journey

686
01:10:55,325 --> 01:11:03,325
There’s no concealing love

687
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:15,039
The love I feel is
bigger than the sea

688
01:11:21,768 --> 01:11:29,768
I am lonelier than a dead leaf

689
01:11:35,983 --> 01:11:37,903
- Hello, my son.
- Good day to you.

690
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:47,069
This is my vintner.

691
01:11:47,262 --> 01:11:49,199
- Good day, aunt Margit.
- Good day.

692
01:11:58,057 --> 01:12:00,367
Have some goulash, Edit,
it's really good.

693
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:12,348
I knew you'd come after me.

694
01:12:12,809 --> 01:12:14,054
Go on, have a drink.

695
01:12:22,523 --> 01:12:23,798
Don't drink any more.

696
01:12:24,075 --> 01:12:25,075
Let's go home.

697
01:12:35,028 --> 01:12:36,887
I'm going back to Budapest today.

698
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:41,957
You're drunk. Come home
and get some sleep.

699
01:12:42,428 --> 01:12:44,010
So what! I'm drunk.

700
01:12:44,828 --> 01:12:45,877
Don't drink any more.

701
01:12:46,065 --> 01:12:47,065
Don't drink.

702
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:49,147
I won't go, leave me alone.

703
01:12:49,313 --> 01:12:50,947
Have a drink, you're so insipid.

704
01:12:53,272 --> 01:12:54,615
I won't go anywhere!

705
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:57,667
I'll go home! I'll do what I want to.

706
01:13:16,353 --> 01:13:18,985
- Help me, will you? Let's take Edit home.
- Okay.

707
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:20,500
Where?

708
01:13:20,693 --> 01:13:21,855
Where are you taking her?

709
01:13:22,441 --> 01:13:23,558
Don't take her away!

710
01:13:36,959 --> 01:13:38,259
- Let's go, shall we?
- No.

711
01:13:38,452 --> 01:13:39,816
- Let's go.
- No.

712
01:13:40,118 --> 01:13:41,445
Let's not make a scene.

713
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:45,456
I won't go.

714
01:13:45,649 --> 01:13:48,602
Why won't you leave me alone?
Margit, help me.

715
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:50,867
Don't let her take me away.

716
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:54,595
- Calm down, Edit dear.
- No.

717
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:56,702
Your sorrow will soon be over.

718
01:13:57,573 --> 01:14:00,752
Please, don't let her take me away!

719
01:14:00,945 --> 01:14:02,755
You'll get some sleep
and it will pass.

720
01:14:02,948 --> 01:14:05,460
- Leave me alone. I don't want to.
- Come with us.

721
01:14:05,662 --> 01:14:08,752
- Please, leave me alone.
- Let's go.

722
01:14:43,325 --> 01:14:44,398
I found this.

723
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:46,318
Come and have a drink.

724
01:14:58,710 --> 01:14:59,710
Don't drink.

725
01:14:59,885 --> 01:15:01,527
Come on.

726
01:15:11,061 --> 01:15:12,061
Okay.

727
01:15:13,753 --> 01:15:15,432
Come on and drink.

728
01:15:24,653 --> 01:15:27,217
You're quite a decent gendarme.

729
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:31,465
No...

730
01:15:34,076 --> 01:15:35,792
you aren't so decent after all.

731
01:15:40,218 --> 01:15:41,740
You think I'm a coward.

732
01:15:44,807 --> 01:15:46,338
Well... that's what I am.

733
01:15:49,293 --> 01:15:51,775
I put up with my husband,
I didn't get a divorce,

734
01:15:53,606 --> 01:15:55,555
I didn't have the guts to do it.

735
01:15:58,810 --> 01:15:59,882
But...

736
01:16:00,573 --> 01:16:02,155
at least I know...

737
01:16:03,570 --> 01:16:05,343
I do know what I am like.

738
01:16:09,667 --> 01:16:12,269
But you think what
you're doing to me...

739
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:14,294
is somehow different.

740
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:19,399
You just want to marry...
István,

741
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:22,115
because you slept with him.

742
01:16:23,902 --> 01:16:25,193
Because he's clever...

743
01:16:27,772 --> 01:16:28,988
and handsome.

744
01:16:32,636 --> 01:16:33,827
But I know...

745
01:16:35,545 --> 01:16:37,825
that my son is just like his father was.

746
01:16:53,333 --> 01:16:55,725
Please... don't drink any more.

747
01:16:56,264 --> 01:16:57,524
Leave me alone!

748
01:16:57,811 --> 01:16:59,205
Go! Leave me alone!

749
01:17:13,825 --> 01:17:16,750
I'll go and leave you alone,
but first I want to tell you something.

750
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:21,130
You said I was a gendarme and insipid.

751
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:25,879
And I'm doing this, because I understand
none of what happened to you.

752
01:17:26,072 --> 01:17:27,774
And because I slept with your son.

753
01:17:28,772 --> 01:17:30,310
Well, maybe I am insipid indeed

754
01:17:30,502 --> 01:17:32,530
and have no sense
of sophisticated things,

755
01:17:32,902 --> 01:17:35,784
nevertheless, I do know
myself and I know you.

756
01:17:38,798 --> 01:17:41,240
You're absolutely a coward,
you've never taken any risks.

757
01:17:42,636 --> 01:17:45,253
There's nothing wrong with
having a fine flat and a villa.

758
01:17:45,446 --> 01:17:46,713
I would like that, too.

759
01:17:47,988 --> 01:17:50,207
Why do you say that everybody
respected your husband?

760
01:17:50,779 --> 01:17:52,967
You know this hasn't
been true for a long time.

761
01:17:53,193 --> 01:17:56,733
People considered him selfish, vain...
and conservative.

762
01:17:58,225 --> 01:18:01,585
You knew it, still you endured,
what's worse, you served him.

763
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:05,239
And now if you want to play
the honourable widow's role,

764
01:18:05,432 --> 01:18:06,432
I'll let you go.

765
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:11,565
This playing the gendarme thing
was really stupid of me.

766
01:18:11,758 --> 01:18:12,914
You do what you want.

767
01:18:14,512 --> 01:18:16,612
Besides... you're right.

768
01:18:16,994 --> 01:18:18,810
Your son is handsome and clever.

769
01:18:19,372 --> 01:18:20,617
That's why I loved him.

770
01:18:21,704 --> 01:18:22,728
But now I'll go.

771
01:18:37,367 --> 01:18:38,367
Kati!

772
01:18:40,481 --> 01:18:42,190
Kati! Stop!

773
01:18:45,298 --> 01:18:46,706
I want to talk to you!

774
01:18:49,243 --> 01:18:50,243
Kati!

775
01:18:50,593 --> 01:18:51,593
Kati!

776
01:18:51,883 --> 01:18:52,933
Why are you leaving?

777
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:54,942
- Stay here.
- No.

778
01:18:55,123 --> 01:18:56,123
I'm going.

779
01:18:56,359 --> 01:18:57,359
Stay here.

780
01:18:57,613 --> 01:18:58,865
I need you.

781
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:00,560
I love you.

782
01:19:01,078 --> 01:19:03,380
You don't need me.
I've told you, I won't do it.

783
01:19:03,951 --> 01:19:04,951
Do it alone.

784
01:19:05,607 --> 01:19:07,534
- Did you think it through?
- I did.

785
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:09,210
Stay here.

786
01:19:10,639 --> 01:19:12,643
Stay here... understand?

787
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:15,253
I want you to stay, I demand it!

788
01:19:16,736 --> 01:19:18,859
I've already told you,
I won't stay. I'm going.

789
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:33,707
Hello, Gáspár!

790
01:19:33,865 --> 01:19:35,230
What are you doing here?

791
01:19:37,490 --> 01:19:39,552
Nothing. Just killing
time with the girls.

792
01:19:40,017 --> 01:19:41,079
You've left them?

793
01:19:41,272 --> 01:19:43,089
Yes. I'm going back to Budapest.

794
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:45,692
Well, bye, then.
I'll stay for a while.

795
01:19:45,872 --> 01:19:47,904
Okay. Bye.

796
01:19:53,518 --> 01:19:56,120
She's wearing a white sweater.
She's not mourning.

797
01:20:02,610 --> 01:20:03,909
What's in your bag?

798
01:20:04,912 --> 01:20:06,472
Leave that girl alone!

799
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,068
Let me court her!

800
01:20:09,944 --> 01:20:11,796
Leave her alone!
Stop that monkey business!

801
01:20:11,989 --> 01:20:12,989
Let her go!

802
01:20:15,659 --> 01:20:16,939
We bid you farewell.

803
01:20:17,921 --> 01:20:18,921
Bye!

804
01:20:22,788 --> 01:20:25,570
Hey! Look who's there!

805
01:20:34,068 --> 01:20:36,145
Chain, chain, turning chain,

806
01:20:36,338 --> 01:20:39,498
Thread of the turning chain,
Would it be a thread...

807
01:20:39,691 --> 01:20:42,720
Who would dare deny that we need...

808
01:20:44,243 --> 01:20:48,010
Who would dare deny that
we need this light?

809
01:20:48,203 --> 01:20:55,095
To see her face
when I finally let her go.

810
01:21:09,763 --> 01:21:14,195

无知的死亡夺走了我们年轻而有才华的力量


826
00:06:29,672 --> 00:06:32,582
蒂博尔·巴拉萨（Tibor Balassa）同志


827
00:06:33,383 --> 00:06:34,846
他是其中之一


828
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:39,668
他们的生活和活动无法弥补


829
00:06:40,464 --> 00:06:42,039
他是一个非凡的人


830
00:06:43,254 --> 00:06:45,953
才华横溢的研究者，杰出的经济学家，


831
00:06:47,513 --> 00:06:49,148
没有障碍的人


832
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:52,299
当他开始做某事时，


833
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,287
他完成了他的任务，


834
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:57,152
他遇到的任何障碍


835
00:06:58,195 --> 00:06:59,282
他的朋友们，


836
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:03,902
熟人，同事们都爱他，并高度敬重他


837
00:07:05,223 --> 00:07:06,302
同志们


838
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,222
内心深处的悲伤，我们现在向他表示最后的敬意


839
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:13,170
我们感到悲伤


840
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,435
不能用言语表达


841
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:19,417
让我们默默地悼念他


842
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:11,110
继续前进，努力寻找和平


843
00:08:11,303 --> 00:08:12,660
我会尽力帮助您


844
00:08:15,818 --> 00:08:18,832
我现在必须走了，但我会联系你的


845
00:08:25,976 --> 00:08:28,360
- 再见


846
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,765
黑夜


847
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,501
如果谁能将它赶走


848
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:39,450
如果是的话，谁能把它赶走


849
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,567
如果它接近我，谁能追赶它呢？


850
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:51,477
如果我问她，那个女孩会做什么。


851
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,739
-苍白的月光-好吗？


852
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,440
-你想和奶奶一起去吗？-是的


853
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:18,971
你可以住一个星期


854
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:22,085
我会打电话给你的班主任


855
00:11:22,453 --> 00:11:23,787
告诉他


856
00:11:24,177 --> 00:11:25,177
谢谢


857
00:11:25,338 --> 00:11:28,338
伊斯万（István）在这里，但不想进来。他说他稍后会回来


858
00:11:29,118 --> 00:11:33,345
当我终于放开她


859
00:11:43,938 --> 00:11:45,663
这音乐不打扰您吗？


860
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:48,025
我已经习惯了，这会激怒您吗？


861
00:11:52,623 --> 00:11:53,623
谢谢


862
00:12:01,028 --> 00:12:02,190
好吧


863
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,762
我待会再见


864
00:12:22,512 --> 00:12:23,952
你会没有我的，奶奶？


865
00:12:24,148 --> 00:12:26,915
我儿子当然可以走了


866
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:49,736
再见


867
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,485
-我现在去-再见


868
00:12:53,618 --> 00:12:55,470
-照顾好自己-好吧


869
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:01,474
再见


870
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,250
你好母亲


871
00:16:49,428 --> 00:16:50,770
你不想让我进去吗？


872
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:51,966
你好


873
00:16:54,525 --> 00:16:56,167
我知道你有一把钥匙


874
00:16:57,621 --> 00:16:59,758
我读过有关父亲去世的论文


875
00:17:00,515 --> 00:17:02,083
我一直在等你给我打电话


876
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:03,425
但是你没有


877
00:17:03,913 --> 00:17:04,963
所以我在这里


878
00:17:05,653 --> 00:17:07,189
我会打电话给你


879
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,694
我很高兴你回来了


880
00:17:19,526 --> 00:17:21,286
早上好，曼奇卡


881
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:25,029
早上好


882
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,831
我很抱歉，但是我很累


883
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,671
-我以为你还在睡觉-没关系


884
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,063
几点了？


885
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:37,066
我不知道，但是已经很晚了


886
00:17:38,312 --> 00:17:39,759
我起得晚


887
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:43,409
我以为我不该来


888
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,080
我试图打电话，但是没人接


889
00:17:48,365 --> 00:17:49,617
所以我来了


890
00:17:51,163 --> 00:17:52,872
无论如何都必须清理公寓


891
00:17:53,158 --> 00:17:54,432
你做了件对的事


892
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,980
对不起，我马上下车


893
00:17:58,835 --> 00:18:00,184
我带杯咖啡


894
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:10,028
谁敢否认我们需要这种光？


895
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:17,056
当我终于放开她时去看她的脸


896
00:18:45,781 --> 00:18:46,781
谢谢


897
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:51,854
广场上几乎没有绿草


898
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:54,973
香烟？


899
00:18:55,362 --> 00:18:56,362
谢谢


900
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,860
我想我在那里感冒了


901
00:19:02,198 --> 00:19:06,358
我一大早就醒了


902
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:10,302
我在晨雾中上路


903
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:13,515
又一个夜晚过去了


904
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,045
还记得吗，Editke？


905
00:19:16,096 --> 00:19:17,295
在'56


906
00:19:20,178 --> 00:19:23,295
我来的时候你站在厨房的门口


907
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,675
“我丈夫逃离了国家”


908
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,560
好像他也死了


909
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:35,597
甚至更糟


910
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:41,478
为什么这样发生，我不知道


911
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:43,478
闻起来很香


912
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,165
闻起来很香


913
00:19:46,945 --> 00:19:51,025
我跟女孩子有什么关系


914
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,787
我不记得我丈夫了


915
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:58,467
我经常拍张照片看看


916
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,945
我不记得他的脸


917
00:20:09,198 --> 00:20:12,858
没有人来我家


918
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:16,407
你想哭，不是吗？但是你不能


919
00:20:18,971 --> 00:20:20,045
我不能


920
00:20:23,883 --> 00:20:28,174
但是如果我有一天找到她


921
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:32,040
我一直在等待的那个


922
00:20:32,325 --> 00:20:36,855
我不相信是她

923
00:20:53,603 --> 00:20:55,235
下午好


924
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,172
你好


925
00:21:44,902 --> 00:21:48,990
列宁：新经济政策和大众教育委员会


926
00:21:49,177 --> 00:21:50,437
第47页


927
00:21:50,993 --> 00:21:53,108
“新的经济政策手段”


928

我们用税收代替了强制性的交付


929
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,422
“在很大程度上恢复资本主义”

00:22:04,437 --> 00:22:07,357
“关于这种误解，

00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,884
休ume到底是什么


934
00:22:17,472 --> 00:22:20,471
当我还是个孩子的时候，我会一直坐在这里看着他的工作


935
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:24,139
我已经两年没被允许进入


936
00:22:25,949 --> 00:22:28,919
除了带早餐和咖啡外，我也没有


937
00:22:32,152 --> 00:22:34,274
你吵了十年


938
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,594
我觉得你们两个都有罪


939
00:22:46,503 --> 00:22:49,052
你还和那个女孩住在一起吗？


940
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:50,203
是的


941
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,722
我们在一起


942
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,700
你没有让她来这里见我


943
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,150
我知道那就是你搬出去的原因


944
00:23:03,372 --> 00:23:05,337
如果您不介意，我想现在把她带到这里


945
00:23:07,618 --> 00:23:08,968
你要嫁给她吗？


946
00:23:11,045 --> 00:23:13,288
还没有


947
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,912
这是您唯一能想到的方法吗？


948
00:23:18,925 --> 00:23:20,700
她还在读书，我也是


949
00:23:23,176 --> 00:23:24,803
你上过大学吗？


950
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,143
三年来


951
00:23:32,687 --> 00:23:33,962
但后来我辞职了


952
00:23:53,585 --> 00:23:54,657
这是不好的时光吗？


953
00:23:55,137 --> 00:23:56,137
不


954
00:23:57,749 --> 00:23:59,092
卡蒂在这里，她可以进来吗？


955
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:02,005
好的


956
00:24:06,438 --> 00:24:07,885
卡蒂，进来


957
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:12,709
你好吗？


958
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:16,190
你好


959
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,824
坐下


960
00:24:27,887 --> 00:24:29,155
我可以煮咖啡吗？


961
00:24:29,425 --> 00:24:31,727
我正在服用镇静剂，我不喝咖啡


962
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:34,014
我也不喝咖啡


963
00:24:36,053 --> 00:24:37,885
妈妈卡蒂（Kati）和我们一起住了


964
00:24:38,597 --> 00:24:39,932
我注意到了


965
00:24:41,455 --> 00:24:43,412
但是，如果您不同意，我们都可以离开


966
00:24:45,805 --> 00:24:48,520
我希望你没有任何条件，儿子


967
00:24:50,515 --> 00:24:52,344
你们俩都可以留下


968
00:24:55,618 --> 00:24:58,385
公寓以及与之相关的一切都是您的


969
00:24:59,321 --> 00:25:01,106
我这里没事


970
00:25:04,658 --> 00:25:06,577
那是你和父亲经常说话的方式


971
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:09,945
那是你的，那是我的，你做到了，我做到了


972
00:25:11,018 --> 00:25:14,355
-我不喜欢你这样说话-我现在不想吵架


973
00:25:15,068 --> 00:25:16,177
我受够了


974
00:25:21,195 --> 00:25:23,820
她什么都知道你可以畅所欲言


975
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,970
我累了让我一个人呆


976
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,980
我们以后再说


977
00:25:40,113 --> 00:25:41,113
很好


978
00:25:47,636 --> 00:25:49,352
- 再见拜拜


979
00:26:17,353 --> 00:26:19,197
- 你好你好


980
00:26:20,821 --> 00:26:22,680
-晚上好-晚上好


981
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,058
进去


982
00:26:47,223 --> 00:26:48,970
-请-您好


983
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,150
这条路


984
00:26:50,771 --> 00:26:51,895
请你进来


985
00:26:53,928 --> 00:26:55,012
晚上好


986
00:26:56,201 --> 00:26:58,295
请进去


987
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,220
这是什么？


988
00:27:03,265 --> 00:27:05,402
我聚集了蒂博尔的朋友


989
00:27:05,785 --> 00:27:07,135
和同事


990
00:27:07,886 --> 00:27:10,652
我想一起看


991
00:27:12,245 --> 00:27:14,645
那位白发男子是谁？


992
00:27:14,923 --> 00:27:16,370
新任副部长


993
00:27:16,563 --> 00:27:18,498
-那家伙是老家伙-我认识他


994
00:27:20,821 --> 00:27:23,060
-是Gyuri吗？-他呢？


995
00:27:23,228 --> 00:27:24,878
我以为他不是化学家


996
00:27:25,545 --> 00:27:26,545
打扰一下


997
00:27:30,341 --> 00:27:31,268
你好


998
00:27:31,387 --> 00:27:32,387
你好


999
00:27:32,511 --> 00:27:34,138
-晚上好-晚上好


1000
00:27:36,028 --> 00:27:38,795
我的哀悼来得如此意外


1001
00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:40,485
我在报纸上读过


1002
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,667
Gyuri，你好吗？


1003
00:27:43,533 --> 00:27:44,785
谢谢


1004
00:27:45,017 --> 00:27:46,353
我已经很努力了


1005
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,167
我正在抚养我的儿子们


1006
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,073
这些天你做什么工作？


1007
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:52,390
我是个工程师


1008
00:27:53,065 --> 00:27:54,917
你离开政治了吗？


1009
00:27:56,268 --> 00:27:57,482
我是个工程师


1010
00:27:57,933 --> 00:27:59,469
非常喜欢我的工作


1011
00:28:01,623 --> 00:28:03,607
你为什么让他们都来？


1012
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,692
你喜欢他们吗？


1013
00:28:06,903 --> 00:28:08,132
不是所有的人


1014
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:11,162
他们中的几个


1015
00:28:12,115 --> 00:28:13,743
你也不喜欢蒂博尔


1016
00:28:14,973 --> 00:28:16,682
但仅自49年以来


1017
00:28:17,815 --> 00:28:20,200
他总是假装好像什么都没发生


1018
00:28:20,395 --> 00:28:21,962
虽然他知道很多事情


1019
00:28:23,138 --> 00:28:25,141
他将成为一名伟大的经济学家，


1020
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,565
但他成为了党的工作人员


1021
00:28:28,021 --> 00:28:29,618
打扰一下，我现在必须离开你


1022
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:33,436
您打算去询问每个人对Tibor的看法吗？


1023
00:28:34,284 --> 00:28:35,284
这是什么？


1024
00:28:35,454 --> 00:28:36,454
一个测试？


1025
00:28:36,886 --> 00:28:38,038
还是只是歇斯底里？


1026
00:28:40,455 --> 00:28:42,479
他们认为他是一个伟人


1027
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:44,125
你确定吗？


1028
00:28:45,262 --> 00:28:46,262
我是


1029
00:28:47,437 --> 00:28:48,437
和你？


1030
00:28:52,027 --> 00:28:54,585
好吧，我不会让你继续前进


1031
00:28:56,495 --> 00:28:58,266
如果你这样说，我会送你走


1032
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:00,805
你不敢


1033
00:29:01,889 --> 00:29:03,336
这里人太多了


1034
00:29:03,892 --> 00:29:06,141
而且你一直害怕丑闻


1035
00:29:31,267 --> 00:29:32,707
我简直不敢相信！


1036
00:29:33,368 --> 00:29:35,497
我已经服用了数天的镇静剂


1037
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,737
我真的不知道该说些什么


1038
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,828
- 求求你了，谢谢你


1039
00:29:43,021 --> 00:29:44,558
- 谢谢你不客气


1040
00:29:55,735 --> 00:29:58,172
我在罗马大使馆听到了这个消息


1041
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,314
你的孩子，你的退休金，都还好吗？


1042
00:30:01,507 --> 00:30:02,785
是的，谢谢

1043
00:30:03,228 --> 00:30:05,455
一天晚上来看我，我想和你谈谈


1044
00:30:05,648 --> 00:30:06,708
好吧，我会


1045
00:30:07,353 --> 00:30:08,725
下个星期给我打电话


1046
00:30:08,918 --> 00:30:11,042
-我总是在八点钟左右进来-好吧


1047
00:30:12,168 --> 00:30:14,162
对不起，我必须走了


1048
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,000
我要去法国请假


1049
00:30:16,735 --> 00:30:18,108
等一下


1050
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:25,554
我要你来


1051
00:30:27,545 --> 00:30:29,157
因为我想要


1052
00:30:29,945 --> 00:30:32,742
蒂博尔的所有朋友在一起


1053
00:30:33,462 --> 00:30:34,797
互相见面


1054
00:30:36,432 --> 00:30:37,550
我想要


1055
00:30:38,112 --> 00:30:40,647
你们所有人从他的图书馆取书


1056
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,377
随便你


1057
00:30:44,517 --> 00:30:45,517
请


1058
00:30:46,437 --> 00:30:47,862
请自便


1059
00:30:48,373 --> 00:30:49,373
来


1060
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:51,659
来选择


1061
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:52,852
来


1062
00:31:10,084 --> 00:31:11,126
妈妈这是什么


1063
00:31:11,893 --> 00:31:13,257
没事吧


1064
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,409
你一定很累


1065
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:22,422
别担心我不会伤到他的记忆


1066
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:25,702
我为你担心


1067
00:31:26,735 --> 00:31:27,753
冷静


1068
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,233
-再见-再见


1069
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:57,340
-再见-再见


1070
00:31:58,262 --> 00:31:59,642
再见


1071
00:31:59,928 --> 00:32:00,928
晚安


1072
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:05,338
- 再见


1073
00:32:09,003 --> 00:32:10,150
再见


1074
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:13,023
-再见-再见


1075
00:32:14,425 --> 00:32:15,685
再见我拿了这个


1076
00:32:15,878 --> 00:32:17,237
-给我打电话-好吧


1077
00:32:18,761 --> 00:32:20,410
冷静点休息一下


1078
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:21,905
再见


1079
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:02,305
您介意我再次致电给您吗？


1080
00:33:03,835 --> 00:33:06,850
我想和你谈谈，成为我的正式人


1081
00:33:07,622 --> 00:33:08,622
好的


1082
00:33:25,906 --> 00:33:27,518
没有我你还好吗


1083
00:33:29,723 --> 00:33:31,627
我已经十五年没见到你了


1084
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,523
这不是真的


1085
00:33:35,475 --> 00:33:36,630
就在一周前


1086
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,648
别傻了


1087
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,925
已经十五年了


1088
00:33:43,905 --> 00:33:45,270
我忘了你


1089
00:33:49,818 --> 00:33:50,860
这是真的


1090
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,960
因为你只是想过自己


1091
00:33:57,677 --> 00:33:58,847
实际上


1092
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,937
只有头三年


1093
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,402
-最近二十个都不错-不，那不是真的


1094
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:08,572
您要求他们来是因为您需要他们的建议吗？


1095
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,672
因为你从未爱过我


1096
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,202
你只是怕我


1097
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:14,339
你已经一个人呆了


1098
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,999
-不好意思-不！


1099
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,865
不要那样做你没有权利


1100
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:21,164
你上演了这个小戏


1101
00:34:22,722 --> 00:34:24,702
美丽，悲伤


1102
00:34:25,161 --> 00:34:26,622
诚实的寡妇


1103
00:34:27,778 --> 00:34:30,020
谁有良心


1104
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,266
你想过得好


1105
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:35,015
舒适地


1106
00:34:35,796 --> 00:34:36,860
安详地


1107
00:34:38,586 --> 00:34:41,105
但是你从未实现和平


1108
00:34:42,238 --> 00:34:43,992
因为你内心不安


1109
00:34:56,173 --> 00:34:57,538
我不能为你感到抱歉


1110
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,085
我只希望你有足够的力量


1111
00:35:02,812 --> 00:35:04,087
玩到最后


1112
00:35:04,643 --> 00:35:05,700
等待


1113
00:35:06,555 --> 00:35:08,287
那是István，我的儿子


1114
00:35:08,678 --> 00:35:09,833
你不记得我吗


1115
00:35:10,013 --> 00:35:11,273
不，我不


1116
00:35:11,461 --> 00:35:12,915
我是你父亲的朋友


1117
00:35:14,538 --> 00:35:15,538
伊斯特万


1118
00:35:16,075 --> 00:35:18,018
告诉他你为什么离开家


1119
00:35:18,346 --> 00:35:20,065
你没有和父亲相处


1120
00:35:20,258 --> 00:35:22,020
因为你一直在战斗告诉他！


1121
00:35:22,342 --> 00:35:24,488
妈妈冷静点这个只涉及我们两个


1122
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,090
我不想打扰你


1123
00:35:32,093 --> 00:35:33,093
我现在去


1124
00:35:34,035 --> 00:35:35,035
再见


1125
00:35:35,377 --> 00:35:36,377
再见


1126
00:35:39,982 --> 00:35:42,030
-再见-再见


1127
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,430
你累了


1128
00:35:51,343 --> 00:35:52,897
-你最好去睡觉-不


1129
00:37:45,128 --> 00:37:46,500
很适合你


1130
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,407
我非常喜欢这些，我只是不知道在哪里穿


1131
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:56,034
-这个也不错-你没有我这么大的东西吗？


1132
00:37:56,227 --> 00:37:57,787
那边有很多东西


1133
00:38:02,123 --> 00:38:03,123
那里


1134
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:07,755
我有一件白大衣我在巴黎买的


1135
00:38:08,483 --> 00:38:10,313
对我来说太大了对你来说还可以


1136
00:38:10,605 --> 00:38:11,655
我会试穿的


1137
00:38:11,843 --> 00:38:14,782
-多么好的纺织品！-太好了！


1138
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:16,207
看看这些颜色！


1139
00:38:17,782 --> 00:38:19,710
我应该搭配哪双鞋？


1140
00:38:21,023 --> 00:38:22,652
是你的大小，不是吗？


1141
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:23,845
-保留-不错


1142
00:38:25,422 --> 00:38:26,667
我什么都不想要


1143
00:38:27,058 --> 00:38:28,400
这些不是我的风格


1144
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,433
丝绸！


1145
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,785
我那里有一堆毛衣


1146
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:34,978
我不能接受


1147
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,462
那我就丢掉


1148
00:38:42,139 --> 00:38:43,139
哦，多么可爱！


1149
00:38:43,401 --> 00:38:44,854
看起来真不错！


1150
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:46,399
你是这样想的吗？


1151
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:59,985
亲爱的耶稣，但我要戴在哪里？


1152
00:39:04,561 --> 00:39:06,425
-这是迪奥（Dior），对吗？-是的


1153
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:08,387
奇妙！


1154
00:39:11,113 --> 00:39:13,242
哦亲爱的！


1155
00:39:13,415 --> 00:39:15,058
所有这些漂亮的衣服！


1156
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,625
还有书包


1157
00:39:46,932 --> 00:39:47,932
进来


1158
00:39:52,297 --> 00:39:54,013
-美好的一天-你好


1159
00:39:54,736 --> 00:39:56,080
-坐下-你好


1160
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,535
我的帽子，你这个笨蛋！


1161
00:40:01,152 --> 00:40:02,240
要喝威士忌吗？


1162
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,650
是的，请


1163
00:40:06,346 --> 00:40:07,690
卡蒂（Kati）不会进来吗？


1164
00:40:11,536 --> 00:40:12,880
这里发生了什么？


1165
00:40:14,153 --> 00:40:16,080
编辑给了我们她的衣服


1166
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,980
这里发生了什么？


1167
00:40:24,098 --> 00:40:26,010
我希望你让我们独自一人


1168
00:40:27,547 --> 00:40:30,547
我说完就去找你


1169
00:40:31,043 --> 00:40:33,282
我想现在和你说话


1170
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:37,694
这是否意味着您要我们离开？


1171
00:40:38,051 --> 00:40:39,138
是的


1172
00:40:42,151 --> 00:40:43,218
那很好


1173
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,215
-再见，亲爱的编辑-再见

1174
00:40:52,886 --> 00:40:54,741
-很久很感谢-再见


1175
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,732
- 再见拜拜


1176
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,953
现在，让我独自一人！


1177
00:41:34,507 --> 00:41:36,172
我想和你谈谈


1178
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:37,890
坐下我快完成了


1179
00:41:40,853 --> 00:41:42,412
-下午好-你好


1180
00:41:46,793 --> 00:41:47,857
妈妈我在听


1181
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,478
我下定决心不接受20万福林保险


1182
00:41:53,671 --> 00:41:54,694
和退休金


1183
00:41:55,373 --> 00:41:56,542
我让你吃


1184
00:41:57,226 --> 00:41:58,380
以及公寓


1185
00:41:58,968 --> 00:42:00,895
我今天要去卫生部签字


1186
00:42:01,088 --> 00:42:02,430
我要你跟我来


1187
00:42:03,653 --> 00:42:04,653
我不会去


1188
00:42:06,728 --> 00:42:08,415
我考虑周全


1189
00:42:11,176 --> 00:42:12,345
你有？


1190
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,462
我不这么认为


1191
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:18,577
我这没关系


1192
00:42:18,758 --> 00:42:20,806
无论是钱还是公寓


1193
00:42:21,143 --> 00:42:22,942
你父亲为此工作


1194
00:42:25,133 --> 00:42:27,367
-和你一起住了21年-是的


1195
00:42:27,826 --> 00:42:29,572
但是我们没有共同之处


1196
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:31,350
除了他照顾我


1197
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:32,782
我们没有离婚


1198
00:42:33,075 --> 00:42:34,665
他是反对它的那个人


1199
00:42:35,542 --> 00:42:37,260
妈妈那是你的事


1200
00:42:37,782 --> 00:42:39,402
但是你必须要看透


1201
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,404
为了我父亲的记忆


1202
00:42:42,532 --> 00:42:45,787
一次我会真正看到一些东西


1203
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,244
我不会和你一起去


1204
00:42:50,408 --> 00:42:53,790
如果您一直保持沉默直到现在，您可以继续保持沉默并忍受


1205
00:42:54,473 --> 00:42:56,715
你不会放弃任何事情，我不会让你


1206
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,580
冷静


1207
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,465
否则，你就自由了，可以随心所欲地生活


1208
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,272
父亲总是这样说：


1209
00:43:05,475 --> 00:43:07,792
“你不会离婚，你可以随心所欲地生活”


1210
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:13,550
我不是要冒犯您，但我不能认真考虑您的决定


1211
00:43:15,372 --> 00:43:16,924
如果你以前不够强壮，


1212
00:43:17,117 --> 00:43:19,771
您现在怎么能在租住的房间里靠1200福林住？


1213
00:43:20,589 --> 00:43:21,691
你没有交易


1214
00:43:22,847 --> 00:43:24,729
我不认为你能做到


1215
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,857
关于道德方面，


1216
00:43:28,059 --> 00:43:29,484
我不会让你伤害父亲


1217
00:43:29,979 --> 00:43:31,974
因为，不像你，我爱他


1218
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,440
-你不懂我-不，我不懂


1219
00:43:39,418 --> 00:43:41,998
-请跟我来-不，我不会


1220
00:43:45,523 --> 00:43:47,165
那我自己去看


1221
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:49,543
卡蒂，来吧，走吧


1222
00:43:49,723 --> 00:43:50,723
快的


1223
00:46:06,107 --> 00:46:07,395
好吧，告诉她来


1224
00:46:21,033 --> 00:46:23,508
妈妈，你能出来吗？


1225
00:46:30,443 --> 00:46:31,443
晚上好


1226
00:46:31,696 --> 00:46:33,228
-你好-卡蒂为我们做的晚餐


1227
00:46:33,421 --> 00:46:34,807
她是一个很好的厨师


1228
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:42,602
化妆吧妈妈


1229
00:46:44,411 --> 00:46:45,411
好的


1230
00:47:11,593 --> 00:47:12,942
干杯


1231
00:47:13,798 --> 00:47:15,111
干杯


1232
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,737
相信我，我爱你，我了解你


1233
00:47:52,778 --> 00:47:54,090
但是现在你很紧张


1234
00:47:54,862 --> 00:47:55,980
我也知道


1235
00:47:58,605 --> 00:48:01,193
你应该去平房一个星期休息一下


1236
00:48:05,624 --> 00:48:06,966
我现在不能走


1237
00:48:07,627 --> 00:48:08,779
我有工作要做


1238
00:48:33,401 --> 00:48:35,440
稍微休息一下真的可以对你有好处


1239
00:48:36,986 --> 00:48:38,292
卡蒂会和你一起去


1240
00:48:38,547 --> 00:48:40,219
-照顾你-哦，是的


1241
00:48:42,785 --> 00:48:46,227
我有东西要安排在这里我现在不能去也不想去


1242
00:48:52,758 --> 00:48:54,805
好吧，那就留下来


1243
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,393
你做你想做的


1244
00:48:59,676 --> 00:49:00,808
给你！


1245
00:49:53,498 --> 00:49:55,170
对不起，你得走了


1246
00:49:55,688 --> 00:49:57,288
我不知道你会来


1247
00:49:57,481 --> 00:49:59,062
我们最终来了


1248
00:50:00,471 --> 00:50:02,970
-你要待很久吗？-我还不知道


1249
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,362
没关系


1250
00:50:11,544 --> 00:50:12,742
来吧，女孩们！


1251
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:15,210
但是我希望你不要觉得交叉，对吗？


1252
00:50:20,115 --> 00:50:22,702
-好吧，再见-再见


1253
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,479
再见，谢谢！


1254
00:50:24,672 --> 00:50:27,052
-谢谢，再见！-再见！


1255
00:51:45,893 --> 00:51:47,137
早上好


1256
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,212
打电话给我就打开


1257
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,085
我怎么到这里了？


1258
00:51:57,467 --> 00:52:00,354
昨晚我们把你带到这里伊斯特万开车，但他回去了


1259
00:52:02,792 --> 00:52:05,289
我在这里照顾你你需要休息


1260
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:11,326
我什么都不记得了


1261
00:52:15,724 --> 00:52:17,659
我们在您的酒中放了安眠药


1262
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:21,395
聪明的方法


1263
00:52:22,935 --> 00:52:24,682
巧妙地完成


1264
00:52:33,403 --> 00:52:35,159
您早餐想吃点什么？


1265
00:52:35,783 --> 00:52:36,787
咖啡？


1266
00:52:37,245 --> 00:52:38,245
蛋？


1267
00:52:38,483 --> 00:52:39,483
牛奶？


1268
00:53:31,623 --> 00:53:33,160
我们待一个星期


1269
00:53:33,663 --> 00:53:34,687
你误会了


1270
00:53:35,486 --> 00:53:37,637
村里有一辆公共汽车从11点出发


1271
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:39,670
我乘下午火车去布达佩斯


1272
00:53:39,863 --> 00:53:41,393
-你做不到-我会做


1273
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:44,543
我很坚强所有的门都锁好了


1274
00:53:44,736 --> 00:53:46,251
我到处都会跟着你


1275
00:53:47,061 --> 00:53:48,703
所以我必须逃跑


1276
00:53:49,514 --> 00:53:50,871
很搞笑


1277
00:53:51,064 --> 00:53:52,144
你无法逃脱


1278
00:53:52,916 --> 00:53:54,324
这是你的早餐


1279
00:53:54,517 --> 00:53:56,028
你为什么做这个？


1280
00:53:56,812 --> 00:53:58,173
伊斯特万问我


1281
00:54:00,435 --> 00:54:01,506
你爱他吗？


1282
00:54:01,699 --> 00:54:02,699
是的


1283
00:54:04,443 --> 00:54:06,100
你愿意嫁给他吗？


1284
00:54:06,648 --> 00:54:08,067
我会的，如果他向我求婚


1285
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,109
我穿好衣服


1286
00:54:22,493 --> 00:54:23,493
过来


1287
00:54:24,996 --> 00:54:25,996
来


1288
00:54:28,998 --> 00:54:29,998
来


1289
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:47,597
你好慈利

1290
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:49,225
慈利是她的名字吗？


1291
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:50,981
是的


1292
00:54:51,389 --> 00:54:53,430
您想午餐吃点什么？


1293
00:54:56,018 --> 00:54:57,804
感谢您的耐心等待，


1294
00:54:57,997 --> 00:55:00,697
但是就像我说的，我要带十一点钟回家


1295
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:04,842
您最好不要，否则我必须将您锁定


1296
00:55:06,545 --> 00:55:08,465
-你会做吗？-我会


1297
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:11,586
所以你会把我锁在里面


1298
00:55:13,902 --> 00:55:14,902
好的


1299
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,849
既然我们要在一起度过一个星期，


1300
00:55:18,038 --> 00:55:20,452
我们可以一起组成这个程序


1301
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:24,087
-我希望你过得愉快-你以为你是谁？


1302
00:55:25,618 --> 00:55:27,259
你以为我怕你吗？


1303
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:29,190
你是谁？


1304
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,707
那你跟我有什么关系


1305
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:36,200
我是KatiCsák，我是化学家


1306
00:55:36,393 --> 00:55:38,120
我出生于45年的多罗格


1307
00:55:39,485 --> 00:55:41,524
我对自己不怎么想，但是


1308
00:55:41,846 --> 00:55:43,391
我想你怕我


1309
00:55:43,714 --> 00:55:45,387
因为你也怕儿子


1310
00:55:46,812 --> 00:55:47,876
这不是真的


1311
00:55:48,364 --> 00:55:49,772
我不怕他


1312
00:55:49,947 --> 00:55:50,947
你是


1313
00:55:59,001 --> 00:56:00,001
慈利！


1314
00:56:03,703 --> 00:56:05,623
就是这里来


1315
00:56:06,608 --> 00:56:07,608
好的


1316
00:56:12,165 --> 00:56:13,928
我希望你现在知道


1317
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:17,715
我想离开就可以离开


1318
00:56:37,713 --> 00:56:38,713
慈利！


1319
00:56:38,861 --> 00:56:39,861
慈利亲爱的！


1320
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,374
早上好


1321
00:56:44,578 --> 00:56:45,578
早上好


1322
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,734
我喂她


1323
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:49,744
我们住在隔壁


1324
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:51,569
你是谁？


1325
00:56:51,787 --> 00:56:53,280
卡斯特（István）的未婚妻


1326
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,417
我们和他妈妈一起在这里，她正在休息


1327
00:56:55,672 --> 00:56:58,072
哦，是的，我听说这位先生死了


1328
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:02,956
-怎么编辑？-她现在睡着了


1329
00:57:03,149 --> 00:57:04,537
我有事要问你


1330
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:06,688
你能再给狗喂一天吗？


1331
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:08,089
为什么不？


1332
00:57:08,242 --> 00:57:10,131
-让她出去-谢谢


1333
00:57:14,262 --> 00:57:15,979
Cili！再见


1334
00:57:16,172 --> 00:57:18,136
-待会儿-非常感谢


1335
00:57:18,329 --> 00:57:19,329
再见


1336
00:57:44,005 --> 00:57:45,005
那只狗？


1337
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:47,852
与邻居


1338
00:57:50,462 --> 00:57:51,583
很棘手


1339
00:57:59,258 --> 00:58:01,350
-门？-我已经锁好了


1340
00:58:16,355 --> 00:58:18,162
如果必须的话，你甚至会打败我


1341
00:58:19,306 --> 00:58:20,615
不，我就把你关起来


1342
00:58:21,872 --> 00:58:23,567
尝试休息，不要歇斯底里


1343
00:58:43,241 --> 00:58:44,241
慈利！


1344
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:46,640
过来慈利


1345
00:58:48,732 --> 00:58:50,584
-Cili！-来吧Cili来吧


1346
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:52,735
-她是你的狗吗？-不，我妈妈的


1347
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,360
来吧慈利


1348
00:58:54,477 --> 00:58:55,662
她有多聪明？


1349
00:58:57,522 --> 00:58:59,142
-拿来-来吧，小狗！


1350
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:01,827
我们要去洗个澡，Cili！


1351
00:59:02,967 --> 00:59:05,637
-Cili！回来吧-Cili，告诉我们你有多聪明


1352
00:59:06,275 --> 00:59:08,052
慈利跳！


1353
00:59:08,233 --> 00:59:10,579
-她不会听你的-茜莉，跳！跳！


1354
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:12,240
她做到了


1355
00:59:12,393 --> 00:59:14,240
跳！快来吧


1356
00:59:24,006 --> 00:59:25,265
- 你好


1357
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:29,080
这是怎么回事？


1358
00:59:29,303 --> 00:59:31,927
我们几乎吵架了她一定要离开


1359
00:59:37,957 --> 00:59:39,855
我认为我们应该停止这样做


1360
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:42,533
只是继续


1361
00:59:45,475 --> 00:59:46,645
我们不应该放开她吗？


1362
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:51,678
我们必须继续几天我知道我的母亲


1363
00:59:52,496 --> 00:59:54,670
她有点歇斯底里，但很快就结束了


1364
00:59:55,307 --> 00:59:56,396
我不这么认为


1365
01:00:25,586 --> 01:00:28,487
-加斯帕，把那个女孩带到这里！-给我几秒钟


1366
01:00:34,663 --> 01:00:37,018
哦，天哪，很冷，但是很好


1367
01:00:43,251 --> 01:00:45,470
禁止在这里游泳！


1368
01:00:45,658 --> 01:00:47,292
出来给我看你的论文！


1369
01:00:53,238 --> 01:00:55,045
出来！


1370
01:00:55,338 --> 01:00:56,338
赶快！


1371
01:00:58,427 --> 01:00:59,450
你在这里做什么？


1372
01:00:59,643 --> 01:01:01,862
-禁止在这里游泳吗？-我们在下棋


1373
01:01:04,765 --> 01:01:06,310
来吧快点！


1374
01:01:06,782 --> 01:01:07,782
出来！


1375
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:11,154
狗也不喜欢


1376
01:01:15,973 --> 01:01:17,338
穿好衣服，快点！


1377
01:01:18,793 --> 01:01:19,793
赶快


1378
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:21,732
你也是


1379
01:01:23,987 --> 01:01:25,780
-给我我的鞋子-快点


1380
01:01:28,878 --> 01:01:30,514
-你！穿上礼服-我？


1381
01:01:30,707 --> 01:01:31,707
来吧


1382
01:01:42,606 --> 01:01:43,885
你看起来很可爱


1383
01:01:57,023 --> 01:01:59,220
小心！你踩着我的衬衫！


1384
01:01:59,663 --> 01:02:01,568
-你要住在哪里？-在露营地


1385
01:02:01,756 --> 01:02:02,971
为什么？怎么了？


1386
01:02:03,668 --> 01:02:04,815
我知道他的问题是什么


1387
01:02:05,002 --> 01:02:07,027
我们有一头长发，我们是小流氓，不是吗？


1388
01:02:08,746 --> 01:02:10,025
来穿上


1389
01:02:10,553 --> 01:02:11,833
你最好表现


1390
01:02:12,026 --> 01:02:14,133
-我们确实表现得很好，我们只是去洗澡-我知道


1391
01:02:14,298 --> 01:02:15,366
-开始吧-嗨


1392
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:17,666
-我不知道你在这里-洗衣服


1393
01:02:18,213 --> 01:02:19,237
他是我兄弟


1394
01:02:19,714 --> 01:02:20,714
走吧


1395
01:02:21,018 --> 01:02:23,216
-来吧，加斯帕-不，我要和他们一起去


1396
01:02:23,409 --> 01:02:24,409
也拿那个


1397
01:02:24,723 --> 01:02:27,235
-去警察局-我的鞋子在哪里？


1398
01:02:27,428 --> 01:02:29,515
加斯帕尔，回来！


1399
01:02:31,351 --> 01:02:32,351
来吧，Cili！


1400
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:34,418
-停止回头，继续前进！-好吧


1401
01:02:34,611 --> 01:02:36,448
-走吧！-为什么要走？


1402
01:02:36,828 --> 01:02:38,290
你会在车站找到


1403
01:02:38,486 --> 01:02:41,748
-您也想告诉我如何呼吸吗？-我们是先锋！


1404
01:02:54,617 --> 01:02:55,682
午餐准备好了


1405
01:03:04,098 --> 01:03:05,185
你不吃饭吗


1406
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:07,220
对不起


1407
01:03:22,336 --> 01:03:24,390
说，您可以被雇用做任何事情吗？

1408
01:03:24,818 --> 01:03:26,625
你想要我的儿子，你可以拥有他


1409
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:30,354
我不仅要他


1410
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:32,052
但他也要我


1411
01:03:35,073 --> 01:03:36,468
编辑亲爱的！


1412
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:44,034
你好吗，玛吉特姨妈？


1413
01:03:44,628 --> 01:03:45,702
已经醒了吗？


1414
01:03:45,895 --> 01:03:47,237
是的


1415
01:03:47,733 --> 01:03:48,733
再会


1416
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:53,103
有人告诉我你丈夫死了


1417
01:03:53,463 --> 01:03:55,113
让他安息


1418
01:03:56,006 --> 01:03:57,430
亲爱的，你还好吗？


1419
01:03:58,323 --> 01:03:59,597
谢谢，我很好


1420
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:02,034
卡蒂（Kati）得到了钥匙


1421
01:04:02,446 --> 01:04:03,446
卡蒂！


1422
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:04,850
打开！


1423
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,095
再会


1424
01:04:13,415 --> 01:04:14,945
我儿子的未婚妻


1425
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:17,544
我们已经见过面了


1426
01:04:19,945 --> 01:04:21,850
你什么时候要结婚？


1427
01:04:22,023 --> 01:04:24,040
在一年的时间里，我完成了大学


1428
01:04:26,815 --> 01:04:29,320
我丈夫也是10年前去世的


1429
01:04:29,852 --> 01:04:31,794
他是一个好人，一个好农夫


1430
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:36,017
我一个人留着九个孩子


1431
01:04:47,561 --> 01:04:50,327
-坐下吧，玛吉特姨妈-谢谢


1432
01:04:53,688 --> 01:04:55,082
她是一个体面的女孩吗？


1433
01:04:56,709 --> 01:04:58,120
哦，是的，非常不错


1434
01:04:58,313 --> 01:04:59,415
那好吧


1435
01:05:04,845 --> 01:05:06,975
好吧，我现在要走了，我很忙


1436
01:05:07,168 --> 01:05:09,259
等等马吉特姨妈


1437
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:12,574
我和你一起去


1438
01:05:13,729 --> 01:05:15,155
我去散散步


1439
01:05:23,176 --> 01:05:24,742
不要走


1440
01:05:26,461 --> 01:05:27,638
洗碗


1441
01:05:28,021 --> 01:05:29,483
我会很快再见


1442
01:05:29,768 --> 01:05:30,975
再见


1443
01:05:31,168 --> 01:05:32,168
再见


1444
01:06:01,682 --> 01:06:03,055
我很高兴你来了


1445
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:12,178
我的两个女儿将来自布达佩斯


1446
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:14,315
我们在一起


1447
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:20,037
我的四个儿子也经常来找我


1448
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:23,690
-我们彼此依依不舍-还有金钱


1449
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:25,235
还有钱


1450
01:06:31,261 --> 01:06:34,102
与丈夫分开的孩子们您将如何处理？


1451
01:06:34,298 --> 01:06:36,382
-我们给了你一个家-是的，的确是


1452
01:06:36,586 --> 01:06:38,497
但是我像马一样工作


1453
01:06:39,315 --> 01:06:42,097
-喝点酒，编辑，真的很好-谢谢


1454
01:06:49,893 --> 01:06:52,247
我想学习，但是没有被学校录取


1455
01:06:52,526 --> 01:06:53,748
我丈夫是锁匠


1456
01:06:53,913 --> 01:06:56,005
他是一个酒鬼，他殴打了我，所以我离开了他


1457
01:07:00,041 --> 01:07:01,532
你怎么现在不读书


1458
01:07:01,725 --> 01:07:03,479
我学习了怎么办？


1459
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,805
妈妈会为丈夫找酒商


1460
01:07:07,052 --> 01:07:08,687
-你不是吗，妈妈？-我当然会


1461
01:07:09,767 --> 01:07:11,544
喝一杯，很好


1462
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:18,359
她和玛吉特姨妈一起走了


1463
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:25,615
-我们应该停止整个业务-否


1464
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:26,845
反正她也不会离开


1465
01:07:27,197 --> 01:07:29,365
走到玛吉特姨妈那里，我待会儿来


1466
01:07:30,783 --> 01:07:31,783
好的


1467
01:07:33,437 --> 01:07:34,437
进来


1468
01:07:46,853 --> 01:07:48,278
你爱我吗？


1469
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:50,210
我愿意


1470
01:07:51,161 --> 01:07:52,240
我想


1471
01:08:00,346 --> 01:08:01,418
还有更多


1472
01:08:02,452 --> 01:08:04,365
你现在一定很伤心


1473
01:08:04,815 --> 01:08:06,127
你为什么难过？


1474
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:09,645
她的丈夫一周前去世了


1475
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:11,888
你爱他吗？


1476
01:08:13,621 --> 01:08:14,745
她做过


1477
01:08:14,938 --> 01:08:16,647
他是布达佩斯的大个子


1478
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,777
如果你爱他，喝一杯


1479
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:20,600
如果你没有也一样


1480
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:55,085
在天堂里闪闪发亮，闪闪发光，闪闪发光！


1481
01:08:55,482 --> 01:09:02,634
指引可怜的小伙子


1482
01:09:03,213 --> 01:09:10,322
指引可怜的小伙子


1483
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:19,190
因为他找不到情人的房子


1484
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:28,872
是我求爱的美女


1485
01:09:29,241 --> 01:09:35,675
对于丑陋的人，我没有注意


1486
01:09:35,868 --> 01:09:39,522
哦，我的心，没人知道


1487
01:09:39,715 --> 01:09:42,445
我爱那个金发女郎


1488
01:09:42,828 --> 01:09:48,190
只有吉普赛人在玩violink才知道


1489
01:09:48,383 --> 01:09:50,200
编辑，你的歌是什么？


1490
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:53,222
“路很宽”


1491
01:09:59,698 --> 01:10:07,698
一条路这么宽，一条路那么长


1492
01:10:10,205 --> 01:10:18,205
我的天使出发了


1493
01:10:21,553 --> 01:10:29,553
我的天使，从漫长的旅程中回来


1494
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:43,830
记住你的诺言


1495
01:10:46,295 --> 01:10:54,295
我们不能从漫长的旅程中回来


1496
01:10:55,325 --> 01:11:03,325
没有隐藏的爱


1497
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:15,039
我的爱比大海还大


1498
01:11:21,768 --> 01:11:29,768
我比枯叶寂寞


1499
01:11:35,983 --> 01:11:37,903
-你好，我的儿子-祝你有美好的一天


1500
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:47,069
这是我的葡萄酒商


1501
01:11:47,262 --> 01:11:49,199
-美好的一天，玛吉特姨妈-美好的一天


1502
01:11:58,057 --> 01:12:00,367
有一些菜炖牛肉，编辑，真的很好


1503
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:12,348
我知道你会跟着我


1504
01:12:12,809 --> 01:12:14,054
继续喝一杯


1505
01:12:22,523 --> 01:12:23,798
不要再喝了


1506
01:12:24,075 --> 01:12:25,075
我们回家吧


1507
01:12:35,028 --> 01:12:36,887
我今天要回布达佩斯


1508
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:41,957
你喝醉了回家睡觉


1509
01:12:42,428 --> 01:12:44,010
那怎么了！我喝醉了


1510
01:12:44,828 --> 01:12:45,877
不要再喝了


1511
01:12:46,065 --> 01:12:47,065
不要喝


1512
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:49,147
我不会去，别管我


1513
01:12:49,313 --> 01:12:50,947
喝一杯，你太平淡了


1514
01:12:53,272 --> 01:12:54,615
我不会去任何地方！


1515
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:57,667
我回去吧，我会做我想做的


1516
01:13:16,353 --> 01:13:18,985
-帮帮我，好吗？让我们来编辑家-好吧


1517
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:20,500
在哪里？


1518
01:13:20,693 --> 01:13:21,855
你要带她去哪


1519
01:13:22,441 --> 01:13:23,558
不要带她走！


1520
01:13:36,959 --> 01:13:38,259
-走吧，好吗？-否


1521
01:13:38,452 --> 01:13:39,816
-走吧-不


1522
01:13:40,118 --> 01:13:41,445
我们不要做一个场景


1523
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:45,456
我不会去


1524
01:13:45,649 --> 01:13:48,602
你为什么不让我一个人呢？玛吉特，帮帮我


1525
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:50,867
不要让她带我走


1526
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:54,595
-冷静点，亲爱的编辑-否

1527
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:56,702
你的悲伤很快就会过去


1528
01:13:57,573 --> 01:14:00,752
求求你，不要让她把我带走！


1529
01:14:00,945 --> 01:14:02,755
你会睡一会，它会过去


1530
01:14:02,948 --> 01:14:05,460
-不想让我一个人-跟我们来


1531
01:14:05,662 --> 01:14:08,752
-拜托，别管我-走吧


1532
01:14:43,325 --> 01:14:44,398
我找到了这个


1533
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:46,318
来喝一杯


1534
01:14:58,710 --> 01:14:59,710
不要喝


1535
01:14:59,885 --> 01:15:01,527
来吧


1536
01:15:11,061 --> 01:15:12,061
好的


1537
01:15:13,753 --> 01:15:15,432
来喝一杯


1538
01:15:24,653 --> 01:15:27,217
你真是个体面的宪兵


1539
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:31,465
不


1540
01:15:34,076 --> 01:15:35,792
你毕竟不那么体面


1541
01:15:40,218 --> 01:15:41,740
你以为我是胆小鬼


1542
01:15:44,807 --> 01:15:46,338
那就是我


1543
01:15:49,293 --> 01:15:51,775
我忍受了我的丈夫，我没有离婚，


1544
01:15:53,606 --> 01:15:55,555
我没有勇气去做


1545
01:15:58,810 --> 01:15:59,882
但


1546
01:16:00,573 --> 01:16:02,155
至少我知道


1547
01:16:03,570 --> 01:16:05,343
我知道我是什么样


1548
01:16:09,667 --> 01:16:12,269
但是你以为你在对我做什么


1549
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:14,294
有所不同


1550
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:19,399
你只想嫁给István，


1551
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:22,115
因为你和他一起睡


1552
01:16:23,902 --> 01:16:25,193
因为他很聪明


1553
01:16:27,772 --> 01:16:28,988
又帅


1554
01:16:32,636 --> 01:16:33,827
但我知道


1555
01:16:35,545 --> 01:16:37,825
我儿子就像他父亲一样


1556
01:16:53,333 --> 01:16:55,725
请不要再喝了


1557
01:16:56,264 --> 01:16:57,524
请别打扰我！


1558
01:16:57,811 --> 01:16:59,205
走吧，让我一个人！


1559
01:17:13,825 --> 01:17:16,750
我会离开你一个人，但首先我想告诉你一些事情


1560
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:21,130
你说我是宪兵，平淡无奇


1561
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:25,879
我这样做是因为我不了解您发生了什么事


1562
01:17:26,072 --> 01:17:27,774
而且因为我和你儿子睡过


1563
01:17:28,772 --> 01:17:30,310
好吧，也许我确实很平淡


1564
01:17:30,502 --> 01:17:32,530
并没有什么复杂的感觉，


1565
01:17:32,902 --> 01:17:35,784
但是，我知道我自己，我认识你


1566
01:17:38,798 --> 01:17:41,240
你绝对是一个胆小鬼，你从未冒险


1567
01:17:42,636 --> 01:17:45,253
拥有高级公寓和别墅没有错


1568
01:17:45,446 --> 01:17:46,713
我也要


1569
01:17:47,988 --> 01:17:50,207
你为什么说每个人都尊重你的丈夫？


1570
01:17:50,779 --> 01:17:52,967
你知道这已经很久了


1571
01:17:53,193 --> 01:17:56,733
人们认为他自私，自负和保守


1572
01:17:58,225 --> 01:18:01,585
你知道的，仍然忍受着，更糟的是，你为他服务


1573
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:05,239
现在，如果您想扮演寡妇的角色，


1574
01:18:05,432 --> 01:18:06,432
我让你走


1575
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:11,565
这个玩宪兵的事情对我来说真是愚蠢


1576
01:18:11,758 --> 01:18:12,914
你做你想做的


1577
01:18:14,512 --> 01:18:16,612
除了你是对的


1578
01:18:16,994 --> 01:18:18,810
你儿子又帅又聪明


1579
01:18:19,372 --> 01:18:20,617
这就是为什么我爱他


1580
01:18:21,704 --> 01:18:22,728
但是现在我去


1581
01:18:37,367 --> 01:18:38,367
卡蒂！


1582
01:18:40,481 --> 01:18:42,190
卡蒂！停！


1583
01:18:45,298 --> 01:18:46,706
我想跟你说话！


1584
01:18:49,243 --> 01:18:50,243
卡蒂！


1585
01:18:50,593 --> 01:18:51,593
卡蒂！


1586
01:18:51,883 --> 01:18:52,933
你为什么要离开？


1587
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:54,942
-留在这里-不


1588
01:18:55,123 --> 01:18:56,123
我要去


1589
01:18:56,359 --> 01:18:57,359
留在这儿


1590
01:18:57,613 --> 01:18:58,865
我需要你


1591
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:00,560
我爱你


1592
01:19:01,078 --> 01:19:03,380
你不需要我我告诉过你，我不会做


1593
01:19:03,951 --> 01:19:04,951
一个人做


1594
01:19:05,607 --> 01:19:07,534
-你考虑透了吗？-我做到了


1595
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:09,210
留在这儿


1596
01:19:10,639 --> 01:19:12,643
留在这里明白吗？


1597
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:15,253
我要你留下，我要！


1598
01:19:16,736 --> 01:19:18,859
我已经告诉过你，我不会留下，我要走了


1599
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:33,707
你好，加斯帕尔！


1600
01:19:33,865 --> 01:19:35,230
你在这里做什么？


1601
01:19:37,490 --> 01:19:39,552
只是和女孩消磨时间


1602
01:19:40,017 --> 01:19:41,079
你离开他们了吗？


1603
01:19:41,272 --> 01:19:43,089
是的，我要回布达佩斯


1604
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:45,692
好吧再见我待会儿


1605
01:19:45,872 --> 01:19:47,904
好的再见


1606
01:19:53,518 --> 01:19:56,120
她穿着一件白色的毛衣她不哀悼


1607
01:20:02,610 --> 01:20:03,909
你包里有什么？


1608
01:20:04,912 --> 01:20:06,472
别管那个女孩！


1609
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,068
让我向她求婚！


1610
01:20:09,944 --> 01:20:11,796
别管她了！别再烦了！


1611
01:20:11,989 --> 01:20:12,989
让她走！


1612
01:20:15,659 --> 01:20:16,939
我们向您告别


1613
01:20:17,921 --> 01:20:18,921
再见！


1614
01:20:22,788 --> 01:20:25,570
嘿，看看谁在那里！


1615
01:20:34,068 --> 01:20:36,145
链条，链条，转弯链条，


1616
01:20:36,338 --> 01:20:39,498
车削链的线，是否会是线


1617
01:20:39,691 --> 01:20:42,720
谁敢否认我们需要


1618
01:20:44,243 --> 01:20:48,010
谁敢否认我们需要这种光？


1619
01:20:48,203 --> 01:20:55,095
当我终于放开她时去看她的脸


1620
01:21:09,763 --> 01:21:14,195
结束
