1
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,690
Wait, so tell me, baby.

2
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,450
We're going to check out an old
abandoned building that we found.

3
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,410
{\an8}It's an abandoned sanatorium
that locals claim is haunted.

4
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,250
Literally, only this guy
can find places like this.

5
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,730
- Wow.
- And all these open windows.

6
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,530
I can't wait to go inside.

7
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,730
- I hope there are no snakes here.
- No, don't worry.

8
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,010
Watch out, behind you.

9
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:31,090
- Ben, did you find the stairs?
- No, Tina. Not yet.

10
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,690
- Be careful.
- Ok.

11
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,570
- What happened here?
- In the 70s,

12
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,850
a nurse poisoned several children
before taking her own life.

13
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,890
- How many children?
- Seven.

14
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,850
Sanatorium was closed down just after.

15
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,530
Ever since, supposedly, the nurse
haunts the hallways and rooms

16
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,050
looking for someone to poison.

17
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,410
Fuck ghosts, right?

18
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,650
What was that?

19
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,010
It's just the wind.

20
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,330
Let's go that way.

21
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,090
Ben, wait for me. It's fucking scary.

22
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,130
Ben!

23
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,690
Ben?

24
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:34,930
Ben?

25
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,370
Ben!

26
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,650
I'm kind of freaked out.
I'm not really in the mood to...

27
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,770
Play.

28
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,010
Boo!

29
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,090
- Gotcha.
- You're so annoying.

30
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,330
I'm sorry, baby.

31
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,930
I look awful in the morning.

32
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,810
Well, I think you look sexy as hell

33
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,930
and it's noon.

34
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:07,930
What was your time?

35
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,770
- Uh, what did you say?
- What was your time?

36
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,130
Oh, I don't know, maybe three minutes.

37
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,930
That's it?

38
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,650
What do you mean "that's it"?

39
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,330
We're going scuba diving,
not snorkelling.

40
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,090
Nervous?

41
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,450
Yeah. Maybe a little.

42
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,250
You've got this. And three minutes
is actually really good.

43
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,850
Especially in a bathtub.

44
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,570
Just think of the lake
as one big bathtub.

45
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:47,610
Reflex.

46
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,370
You're such a dick. You're driving.

47
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,850
You can tell it's summer
by the fact the hay has been brought in

48
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,530
and taken into bales.

49
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,530
And there's
a wonderful river valley below.

50
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,810
Oh, my god.

51
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,730
Ben, what the fuck? Stop it.

52
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,850
- What does the GPS say?
- It says that we're here.

53
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,050
I mean, we're lost.

54
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,890
Well, it wouldn't exactly
be easy to find

55
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,330
if it was really
such a super-secret spot, would it?

56
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,250
Guess that means
I gotta go ask someone.

57
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,210
So here we are
in south west France.

58
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,730
A very typical...

59
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,210
In my opinion, slightly dying village.

60
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,090
And here's
a classic world war two monument.

61
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,730
You notice a lot of the names
are shared.

62
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:07,610
So there was few families here, which
lost a lot of their favourite sons.

63
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,610
As I said, it's sort of a dying village
because you'll notice

64
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,730
a lot of the houses on this main square
have for sale signs in them.

65
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,810
Doesn't appear
to be many people around and...

66
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,210
This one's also for sale.

67
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,330
You can notice in the architecture
of the small window up by the attic

68
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,650
which would often be used
as a storeroom.

69
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,810
They would have often had
a joist and a pulley system

70
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,930
to bring the bags of grain up
and stored in the attic.

71
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,850
{\an8}Fruit.

72
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,690
Let me guess, they've never heard of it.

73
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,050
Actually they said that...

74
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,250
So...

75
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,530
- We can't see it?
- No, we can't miss it.

76
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,490
Not so secret spot, huh?

77
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,650
Fuck's sake.

78
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,170
<i>Oh, it's really creepy over there.</i>

79
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,290
<i>- It's really creepy everywhere.
- I know.</i>

80
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,970
- 50,000 views on the sanatorium video.
- So?

81
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,210
I want more.

82
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,570
Every dickhead with a gopro
is down there.

83
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,650
Well, that's a bit ironic, isn't it?

84
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,610
Tb urbex isn't exactly going
to break the Internet today.

85
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,490
So what?

86
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,290
I thought the whole point was
to get out of the library,

87
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,490
stop reading about those things,
start living them.

88
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,490
You're acting like a little baby.

89
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,450
You're just relieved
you won't have to dive.

90
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,770
Sorry, look, I-I-I know
you trained really hard for this.

91
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,450
Why don't we just be tourists
for the day?

92
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,690
Do that boat thing, lay on the beach.

93
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:37,210
- We're going to need wine though.
- Oh, thank you for this.

94
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,930
Ben, please don't invite him over
for a drink. Please.

95
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,890
Thank you.

96
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,450
New friend?

97
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,130
Pierre.

98
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:30,330
He tells me there's nothing
but ruins and shit down there.

99
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,450
Apparently all the houses were
destroyed before the flood, so...

100
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,050
Even without all those tourists,
frais lake was...

101
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,970
Never really worth our time.

102
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,570
If only we could have found out
beforehand.

103
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,170
Well, this part of the lake's
not worth our time.

104
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,410
For a relatively small fee,
Pierre's offered to take us

105
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,570
to an isolated arm of the lake
that runs deep into the woods.

106
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,570
Apparently it's very difficult to access

107
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,570
and according to him
a proper secret spot.

108
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,010
I thought we agreed
to just be tourists for the day.

109
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:04,090
I know. But listen, babe, at
the bottom of this part of the lake...

110
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,650
- Come on. You're being annoying.
- There's a perfectly preserved house.

111
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,650
"Forest cantaloupe."

112
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,170
<i>Chanteloup.</i>

113
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,890
- It means singing wolf.
- Cool name.

114
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,490
Erm, and what about the house's area?
What's it called?

115
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,090
Nothing. It's not on any map.

116
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:11,850
The region suffered a series of
devastating floods about 50 years ago.

117
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,330
Then construction to control
the water flow began in, er...

118
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,890
1984. Wikipedia.

119
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,050
- Go on, Pierre.
- The village was emptied.

120
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,370
The valley voluntarily flooded.

121
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,890
And that's how frais lake came to be.

122
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:32,090
With a pack of tourists like you
come to dive there since.

123
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,730
{\an8}Guys. Do I need
to, erm, pay for subtitles here?

124
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,250
I was saying that we'll have to cover
the last couple of miles by foot.

125
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,770
We're not gonna go viral by...

126
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,210
It's a long way,
but I promise it's worth it.

127
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,490
Watch where you put your feet,
darling.

128
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,730
- Why? Do you think there are snakes?
- You'll see.

129
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,170
So he is the bold one
and you're the scared one.

130
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:40,330
Yeah, I can get nervous
but I'm working on it.

131
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,290
{\an8}<i>Voilà.</i>

132
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,090
Repairs to the hf seem to have worked,

133
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,850
so we shouldn't lose sound this time.

134
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,850
What is that thing?

135
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,850
It's, er, my drone. His name's Tom.

136
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,130
Tom.

137
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,450
Like a peeping Tom.

138
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,770
Someone who likes to watch.

139
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,770
It's gonna follow us
everywhere shooting in 4k.

140
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,250
Four what?

141
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,450
Nice sticker.

142
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,570
Cross of nero.
Symbolizes the death christendom.

143
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,690
Those hippies didn't know that
when they chose it as their symbol.

144
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,090
You didn't want
to tell me that beforehand?

145
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,250
- What does it mean?
- Peace and evil, darling.

146
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,410
{\an8}What did you say?

147
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,490
All I heard was like,
"mort blah blah blah."

148
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,530
Nothing.

149
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,930
Drop it.

150
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,330
Just an old family motto.

151
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:56,490
You got 60 minutes of air and
you can hold your breath close to three.

152
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,290
You've got this.

153
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,690
We're going to be in and out. I promise.

154
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,810
We'll get back to New York,
we'll edit the footage.

155
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,570
Once we reach our first million views,

156
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,090
we're going straight
to the littlest chapel in Vegas.

157
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,050
A drive-through wedding.

158
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,690
Ok.

159
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,770
Just below,
it's the perfect spot to propose.

160
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,530
You swim straight for 50 minutes.

161
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,250
You cannot miss it.

162
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,010
Follow the stairs down.

163
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,850
The stairs?

164
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,490
Sound test. Say something, Tina.

165
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,130
That guy gave me the creeps.

166
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,130
I hear you loud and clear.

167
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,690
- Let's go.
- He kept staring at me.

168
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,290
Watch out, shark.

169
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:14,970
No, I'm serious.
On the way back, you drive next to him.

170
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,090
Sure.

171
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:19,650
- Unless he's already left with the Van.
- What?

172
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,690
{\an8}Just kidding. I got the keys.

173
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,770
So here we are in the lac du frais.

174
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,250
Visibility is pretty good.

175
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,890
We're reaching
the first plateau ten meters down.

176
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,410
Ben!

177
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,210
Ben!

178
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,210
- What?
- Look! My fin. It's stuck.

179
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,050
{\an8}Oh, shit. Come on. Help me.

180
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:05,930
Wait here and I'll come
pick you up on the way back.

181
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,850
Shut up. Let's keep going.

182
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,450
Hey, look.

183
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,810
Wow, it's a rover.

184
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,850
A rover p6, even.

185
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,530
It's in great condition.

186
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,530
Amazing.

187
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:39,490
- You ever see anything like it?
- It's fairly common in lakes.

188
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,850
It's not sea water, you know.

189
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:48,010
- Made in britain, baby, just like me.
- Yeah and pig's blood pudding.

190
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,930
Ah. Touché.

191
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,330
Will you put a song on?

192
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,370
Jesus. Ben!

193
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,690
What? You don't like it?

194
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,610
{\an8}Better?

195
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,850
"Follow the stairs down."

196
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:14,250
Wow. There she is.

197
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,250
More than 30 meters down.

198
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,250
We see before us
the gates to the property.

199
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,890
I forgot how superstitious
people are in these parts.

200
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,450
No kidding.

201
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:46,810
- Oh, no! No trespassing I guess.
- Yep. Shall we go back up?

202
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,650
Nice try, baby.

203
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,610
Come on. Let's do it.

204
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:59,930
So weird. All the fish have gone.

205
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,050
Maybe the no trespassing sign
was for them.

206
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,570
That man Pierre is full of shit.

207
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:11,450
- It's not a house. It's a shed.
- No, silly.

208
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,330
It's a crypt. Montegnac.

209
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,370
Private mausoleum in the garden.

210
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,570
- Must've been well off.
- What's wrong with the song?

211
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:21,850
Turn it off.

212
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,290
No. No, no, no,
don't do that. It's bad luck.

213
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,370
You're way too superstitious.

214
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,970
God is watching over us.

215
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,450
- Stop it.
- Inri.

216
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,050
Stop!

217
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:48,970
Inri...

218
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:57,490
This place is massive.
Lots to discover, I bet.

219
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,450
Come on, Tina.

220
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,930
It's unbelievable.

221
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:31,090
It's steel. And sealed shut.

222
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,610
It's all right.
We'll find a way in.

223
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,050
Let's split up.

224
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,210
It's completely shuttered up.

225
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,610
But why shutter a house
that's going to get flooded?

226
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,610
Let's find out.

227
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:18,970
Upstairs.

228
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,090
Same deal.

229
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,050
There's no way to pry these windows
open from the outside.

230
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:42,210
If you want to try the chimney,
you're going down first.

231
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,890
No need.

232
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,050
<i>Voilà!</i>

233
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,370
Shit!

234
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,970
The bastard better not
have knackered my drone. You're right.

235
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,130
Yeah.

236
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,970
Top scares get the maximum likes.

237
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,690
- I just hope you got that on camera.
- Oh, yeah, I got it.

238
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:10,330
Send in the drone.

239
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,370
Out of the way.

240
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,050
Must be the attic.

241
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,850
But they left all the furniture.

242
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,650
Raise your glass to our discovery.

243
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:24,930
Look.

244
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:31,610
- I loved these as a kid.
- So pretty.

245
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:35,410
♪ <i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>

246
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,290
insane.

247
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,610
Hm, my grandma had one just like that.

248
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,450
That's so cool.

249
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,290
Yeah.

250
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,690
{\an8}Fuck!

251
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,250
- What?
- Fuck.

252
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:06,570
Oh, my god,
that scared the hell out of me.

253
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:09,450
Cool. Creepy dolls always work.

254
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,930
Oh.

255
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,450
Air?

256
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,290
I have 87 percent left.

257
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:22,530
- Eighty four percent for me.
- Right. Breathe a little slower. Ok?

258
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,570
Ok.

259
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:26,610
Good.

260
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,770
Relax. The house doesn't look too big.

261
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,610
It won't take us long.

262
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,050
Jesus.

263
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,850
Come on.

264
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,050
It's pitch black.
I can't see a thing.

265
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:17,370
- Ladies first.
- Very funny. Send in the drone.

266
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:26,370
Let's see what the sonar says.

267
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,290
What did you say?

268
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,770
- Nothing.
- What?

269
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:48,490
- I heard a voice.
- Must have been interference.

270
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:51,370
Like long frequency,
a radio or plane or something.

271
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,930
Absence of echo means nothing there.

272
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:10,410
No fish, no doll to leap out at you.

273
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,850
We can proceed.

274
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,210
Oh, that's cool.

275
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,690
They look like a bunch of freaks.

276
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,170
I'd say they look like
your average French family.

277
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,530
Shut up!

278
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,450
Tina, quick selfie for our followers.

279
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:06,090
Ugh. Does it have to be
in front of a dead animal?

280
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,450
For our followers.
It's just a skull.

281
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,490
Are you pitching to hunters now?

282
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,530
Tb urbex. Comment, like...

283
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:15,730
Share.

284
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,050
I don't like this place.

285
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:27,290
I don't like it either. I love it.

286
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:34,290
This could be the door
to a million views.

287
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,690
This house was underwater
before I was even born.

288
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:00,050
I mean,
how is this stuff not all decayed?

289
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,330
What kind of kids were those?

290
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,810
Weird kids.

291
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:25,410
Tina, check me out.

292
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:27,890
Yee-ha!

293
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:30,890
No, no, no. Stop.
Come on. Have a little respect.

294
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,570
- Great shot, right?
- Sure.

295
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,970
- What do you think?
- Your followers will love it.

296
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,610
Fuck! Tina.

297
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,730
- What?
- Look.

298
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,850
There's someone behind that.

299
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,050
What are you talking about?

300
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,930
You're freaking me out
with your stupid pranks.

301
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,170
Shit, the light.

302
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,450
Switch that back on.

303
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,770
It's not me, I swear.
I didn't touch a thing.

304
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,729
For fuck sake, Ben. If you're trying
to freak me out, I promise you...

305
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:21,769
Tina, honestly, I saw human silhouette.

306
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,289
You didn't see it?

307
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:27,249
- Knock it off. You're freaking me out.
- Ok. Sorry.

308
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:31,610
It was most likely nothing.
Just a shadow.

309
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:34,450
You dick. Don't even do that.

310
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:38,370
What's up with Tom?
Jesus, Tom. Don't do this shit to me.

311
00:34:43,209 --> 00:34:46,289
- Maybe the fish damaged it.
- Maybe.

312
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,010
I rebooted him.

313
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,290
I hope he holds out
till the end of the dive.

314
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,930
Moving on.

315
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,570
Heading downstairs.

316
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,730
Hey. It's the front door.

317
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:54,450
- What are those marks?
- They look like... scratches.

318
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:56,850
What the hell?

319
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,770
Fuck.

320
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:02,050
Like someone was trapped
inside the house.

321
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,370
What was that?

322
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:09,170
A piano?

323
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,290
- Another diver?
- I don't know.

324
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:20,570
Do you think
it's Pierre messing with us?

325
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,210
I haven't got a clue.

326
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,370
Tom's detecting movement.

327
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,770
It just stopped.

328
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,450
Let's take a look-see.

329
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,290
What is moving?

330
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:50,170
I don't understand. I see nothing.

331
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:54,690
I don't get it.
Is it us that's setting him off?

332
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:58,850
Impossible.
Tom has us in his parameters.

333
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:17,050
Must have been a fish.
Came down the chimney.

334
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,130
And the piano?

335
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:23,490
Most likely it was a string
that snapped from the corrosion.

336
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:25,090
You can try explain it away,

337
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:28,130
but there's something
very wrong with this place.

338
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,690
Ben, the shadow, the scratches
on the door, the weird sounds.

339
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:34,850
- Everything's weird underwater.
- Ben, admit it!

340
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:37,930
Yeah, it's pretty freaky.

341
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,770
But this is an absolute first.

342
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:44,770
There's no such thing
as haunted houses.

343
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,970
Sure, yeah.
There's some weird stuff going on.

344
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,090
But just imagine the mad film
we're going to bring back.

345
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,930
We're not in any kind of danger.

346
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,250
But now we're here, honestly...

347
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:58,170
Don't you want to go a bit further?

348
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,690
Sure.

349
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:09,290
I mean, there can't
be many rooms left to see.

350
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,690
With what just happened, I cannot lie,

351
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,330
we're starting to freak out.

352
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,970
The adrenaline is pumping.

353
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,450
And we continue our exploration.

354
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,570
So we reach the next room.

355
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:38,570
{\an8}- Are those what I think they are?
- Yeah.

356
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,770
Missing people posters.

357
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:46,770
{\an8}- And it's all kids.
- What kind of freaks collect those?

358
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,330
Here's the kitchen.

359
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,090
Oh, shit. It's down again.

360
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:37,250
- Sure the batteries aren't dead?
- They're brand new.

361
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,810
Shit!

362
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:44,610
- What the hell was that?
- No idea.

363
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:26,610
Holy shit.

364
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:32,770
What the hell
is that doing in a kitchen?

365
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,890
There's a door behind it.
Come on, Teenie.

366
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,450
What if it's a secret room?

367
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:49,290
What the fuck are we doing?

368
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,970
Come on. Give me a hand.

369
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:00,250
Yeah, I got it.

370
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,770
Pull on that side.

371
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:07,690
Pull it up.

372
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,730
Promise me
this is the last room we explore.

373
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:28,850
I promise.

374
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,490
It's too dark.

375
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:50,010
I can't see a thing down here.

376
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:52,450
The water's too murky.

377
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:55,090
It's useless.

378
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,690
I'll send the drone.

379
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,610
We'll be fine. Ok?

380
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:25,050
Come on. Let's go.

381
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:53,090
Look at this.

382
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:55,850
What's with all the video gear?

383
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:58,610
It's film.

384
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:00,730
Super 8.

385
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:02,810
Wait.

386
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:05,250
There was lots of film
in the kids' bedroom, too.

387
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,490
What kind of stuff were they filming?

388
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:17,690
What the fuck is that?

389
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:32,650
That's it. I'm out.
We're going back up.

390
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:34,010
Ok.

391
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:35,650
You're right. Let's go.

392
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:41,330
Ben!

393
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:44,250
We'll go, we'll go.
Just a few more shots.

394
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:48,090
Just two minutes, no more.
Please, Tina. Wait for me here.

395
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:51,290
Ok, two shots,
and we're out of here, Ben. Two.

396
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:53,770
Ok.

397
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:04,730
They must've been chained up
down here before it was all flooded.

398
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:07,170
Chained up alive. Why?

399
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:09,290
I guess the answer is under there.

400
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:18,450
A pentagram.

401
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,050
That's satanic shit.

402
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:25,970
And the masks, too?

403
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:29,210
They look like torture masks
from the middle ages.

404
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,250
Who are they?

405
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:39,250
And how come they're... intact?

406
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:40,770
I have no idea.

407
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:45,770
You think
that's because of the lake water, too?

408
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,970
It's impossible.
They should be skeletons.

409
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:51,570
What the...

410
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:06,970
- What are you doing?
- Stay here. I'll just take a look.

411
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:09,130
Ben, don't leave me alone.

412
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,450
Don't worry.

413
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:13,410
I'm here.

414
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:27,770
Do you see anything?

415
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,170
Fuck.

416
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:38,930
What? What's wrong?

417
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:43,130
Ben.

418
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:49,130
- Ben! Ben, come back.
- Ok.

419
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:51,530
Now!

420
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:57,330
What was behind the door?

421
00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:01,050
Nothing. Just more cameras.

422
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:24,490
- We're calling the cops.
- No.

423
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:26,810
They'll confiscate our memory cards.

424
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:30,850
This is more than a flooded house, Ben.
It's a crime scene.

425
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:33,370
Oh, my god!

426
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:48,890
Look!
There's a fucking brick wall.

427
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:52,770
How?

428
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:54,850
No.

429
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:57,970
- No.
- Stop, Tina.

430
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:59,930
No, no, no, no.

431
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:01,770
- We're trapped!
- Stop, Tina!

432
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,330
We're never gonna get out!

433
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:06,690
- Maybe we got the wrong room.
- Bullshit!

434
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:09,090
- Tina, look at me. Calm down.
- No, no, no.

435
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:12,090
- Look! You can see.
- You're breathing air way too fast.

436
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:15,450
- How the fuck did that get here?
- No idea. Please.

437
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:17,930
Calm down.

438
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:21,450
- Breathe slowly.
- Ok.

439
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:24,850
Otherwise we won't have time
for our stops on the ascent.

440
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:26,770
- Ok?
- Ok.

441
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:29,930
It's gonna be fine.
Breathe like me.

442
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:35,050
There's someone there!

443
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:37,930
- Oh, my god, I saw someone.
- Where?

444
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:43,930
- There! Right behind you!
- There's nothing there.

445
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:46,370
- There, there.
- Are you sure?

446
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,370
The house.

447
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:49,490
No.

448
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:51,210
The house is haunted, Ben.

449
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,690
- Could be.
- Then we're never gonna get out.

450
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:55,690
We're never gonna get out.

451
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:59,330
We're gonna drown.

452
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:03,570
- I don't want to die.
- We're going to get out, Tina. Ok?

453
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:07,050
Let's go back down. Try the windows.

454
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:09,010
Ok.

455
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:11,010
Control your breathing.

456
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:15,330
It's going to be just fine.
Just take my hand.

457
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,610
Ok.

458
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:55,930
- What's going on?
- Fuck!

459
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:00,770
- It won't fucking break.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

460
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:03,970
- I'll try and open the shutters.
- Ok, ok.

461
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:26,210
Oh, shit!

462
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,890
Oh, Ben! Ben!

463
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:36,130
Ben! The fish!

464
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:38,330
The fish.

465
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:40,450
- What?
- The fish, it's back.

466
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:43,450
There must be another way in.

467
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:49,530
- Ok. Can you see it?
- There, it went into the kitchen.

468
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:54,570
Wait, wait. There it is.

469
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:09,690
You're going back down there?

470
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:12,050
It's our only hope.

471
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:27,410
- Holy shit.
- What?

472
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:29,730
- What is it?
- Nothing.

473
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:34,730
- You see it?
- No! I lost it!

474
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:48,410
Oh, shit!

475
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:52,050
It found an opening
but it's too small for us.

476
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,930
Why did you put the music back on?

477
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:02,730
- What music?
- Turn it off.

478
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,370
It's not me.

479
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:12,450
There's a well.

480
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:14,370
Fuck!

481
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:22,570
There's a grate.

482
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:26,050
Jesus, Ben! Turn it off!

483
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:32,770
Ben?

484
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:37,770
Ben? The couple...

485
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:39,410
Ben, the couple disappeared.

486
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:41,250
Ben, talk to me!

487
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:45,010
Ben! Ben, talk to me!

488
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:48,290
Ben!

489
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:20,130
Ben!

490
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:53,410
Help!

491
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:02,730
Tina!

492
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:11,330
Tina, can you hear me?

493
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,650
You ok, baby?

494
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:17,730
I called for help
and you didn't answer.

495
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:20,130
- I was right behind you.
- I was attacked.

496
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:22,210
It was the chains. It was the chains.

497
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:26,250
I was right here
looking for the fish.

498
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:28,730
When I turned around,
you were upside down.

499
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:32,250
- You're hurt!
- Ben, the bodies.

500
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:35,810
- They disappeared.
- What?

501
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:37,570
Look!

502
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:40,210
No.

503
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:42,930
- No, it can't be.
- They're dead.

504
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:45,330
- No!
- They're fucking dead.

505
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:47,810
No!

506
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:49,610
No.

507
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:52,450
What are you doing?

508
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:56,090
Ben, no, no, no.

509
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:02,090
Oh, my god.

510
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:14,170
Oh, my god.

511
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,250
Oh, it's them.

512
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:24,490
It's the owners of the house.

513
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:30,530
Shit!

514
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:32,970
Swim! Go! Swim.

515
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:36,490
Fuck!

516
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:40,330
Swim!

517
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:47,730
They're fucking alive!

518
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:52,010
They can't be.

519
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:54,410
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

520
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:11,010
Ben.

521
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:15,530
Shut the door. Shut the door!

522
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:36,250
The chimney...
The chimney, it's our only chance.

523
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:40,650
Ben. Ben, I can't breathe! Ben, I'm...

524
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:44,210
- I'm suffocating.
- Short, shallow breaths, Tina.

525
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,930
We are getting out.

526
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:50,890
It's narrow. Take your tank off.

527
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:55,010
- Ben, I'm not going to make it.
- Breathe.

528
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:56,770
Breathe like this...

529
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:02,050
Good, Tina.

530
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:04,770
Great.

531
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:08,410
Inhale.

532
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:12,370
Exhale.

533
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:15,090
Inhale.

534
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:21,090
This rope up.
Our way out is at the top there.

535
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:23,210
I'll send Tom up to give us some light.

536
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:32,650
We can do this, all right?

537
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:38,690
Come on.

538
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:51,970
You good?

539
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:55,130
- Are you with me?
- Yes.

540
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:58,170
Almost there, Tina.
We'll make it out, I promise.

541
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:06,370
Not far now. Hang in there.

542
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:12,290
Come on.

543
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:17,130
What the fuck is that?

544
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:19,490
What the fuck is that?

545
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:24,050
Oh! Take cover!

546
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:37,730
Fuck!

547
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:24,650
Ben.

548
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:30,210
Ben?

549
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:34,290
Ben! Ben, I'm stuck in the chimney.

550
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:37,530
Ben, where are you?

551
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:41,170
Help.

552
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:53,090
Ben?

553
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:55,010
Ben, answer me.

554
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:59,170
Ben, answer me!

555
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:00,810
Talk to me.

556
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:03,330
Talk to me.

557
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:05,210
Ben!

558
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:45,530
Tina? Tina, are you ok?

559
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:46,690
Come on, Tom.

560
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:49,850
Work! Work, you fucker!

561
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:56,250
Oh, shit.

562
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:57,530
Ben, where are you?

563
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:00,410
Talk to me.

564
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:02,930
Ben, talk to me!

565
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:06,970
Tina, where are you?

566
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:09,570
Tina!

567
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:14,690
Tina, I'm locked in the bedroom.
I'm upstairs.

568
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:25,010
Damn it!

569
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:32,810
Oh, shit!

570
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:34,450
Shit.

571
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:35,530
Ben!

572
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:37,490
Ben, where are you?

573
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:44,890
Ben?

574
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:48,050
Ben, answer me!

575
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:12,290
Fuck.

576
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:26,370
Pierre, you bastard.

577
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:28,250
You're the montegnac's son!

578
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:37,690
Come on, Tom. Work! Work, you fucker!

579
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,610
Tina, can you hear me?

580
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:44,090
Tina, are you ok?

581
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:51,290
Fuck! Tina!

582
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:54,650
<i>Ben! Ben, where are you?</i>

583
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:42,730
Ben, can you hear me?

584
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,250
Ben!

585
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:52,610
Ben!

586
01:03:55,810 --> 01:03:57,330
Where are you?

587
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:29,250
Ben!

588
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:31,650
Ben!

589
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:45,730
Ben.

590
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:07,170
Ben, are you here?

591
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:10,850
Ben!

592
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:23,730
Oh, Ben.

593
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:28,650
Ben!

594
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:32,690
Ben, I'm here.

595
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:37,010
I'm here, sweetheart. Are you ok?

596
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:40,170
Oh, my god. Are you hurt?

597
01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:42,770
Oh, your mask!

598
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,850
- It's leaking. What's going on?
- I'm better.

599
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:51,130
- I'm better now.
- Ok. Ok.

600
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:53,850
- How much air do you have left?
- I don't know.

601
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:58,530
Ok, you have 12 percent.

602
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:02,450
{\an8}- I have eight percent left.
- You'll die before me.

603
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:04,050
What?

604
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:08,690
- What are you talking about?
- We're out of danger now.

605
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:10,450
Ben!

606
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:13,850
Snap out of it. You're in shock.

607
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:17,130
Ben, we're gonna get out of here.

608
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:19,010
For fuck sake, wake up.

609
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:21,170
Please.

610
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:24,050
Please. I love you, baby.

611
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:34,690
Oh, my god.
Something's in my suit. Fuck! Fuck!

612
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:38,010
Oh, fuck. Help!

613
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:41,130
Do you see anything?

614
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:44,530
Oh, my god, it's crawling up my ribs!

615
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:45,810
Keep calm, Tina.

616
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:50,130
Where is it? Where is it?

617
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:52,210
Oh, my god. I can feel it up my neck.

618
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:56,490
It's only a snake.

619
01:06:57,290 --> 01:06:58,410
What? What?

620
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:08,330
Look at me, Tina.

621
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:13,490
- Open your mouth.
- What?

622
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:16,050
Let it in.

623
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:19,370
- What?
- Swallow it!

624
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,050
Let go of me, Ben!

625
01:07:35,370 --> 01:07:38,010
- Did you see that?
- It's the house.

626
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:40,530
She knows...

627
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:43,450
- She knows your fears.
- What?

628
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:46,650
Soon we'll have nothing to be afraid of.

629
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:48,450
Where are you going?

630
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:55,490
- The cellar.
- Not the cellar, Ben, no!

631
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:59,490
We already explored the basement.
There's nothing down there.

632
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:02,530
- You'll see.
- No. No, Ben!

633
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:05,690
This is the way.

634
01:08:07,530 --> 01:08:09,450
The way out?

635
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:13,930
Trust me.

636
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:34,449
Almost there.

637
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:49,930
This is it.

638
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:57,050
Oh, my god. Finally.

639
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:01,329
What?

640
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:04,449
Come in, Tina.

641
01:09:06,369 --> 01:09:09,890
There's nothing here.
It's a dead end.

642
01:09:10,369 --> 01:09:12,930
This is where it all begins,
my love.

643
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:18,810
- Where is the way out?
- There was never a way out.

644
01:09:19,449 --> 01:09:21,250
- We're safe here.
- Fuck.

645
01:09:22,409 --> 01:09:24,529
{\an8}- Five percent.
- Good, Tina.

646
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:27,369
Breathe like me.

647
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:29,730
We belong to this place now.

648
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:32,210
We've been chosen.

649
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:35,290
Ben!

650
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:43,650
What the fuck is that?

651
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:47,290
Mr montegnac and his son, Pierre.

652
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:50,210
Pierre?

653
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:52,770
They would kidnap kids
from the neighbouring farms

654
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:54,090
and sacrifice them.

655
01:09:55,970 --> 01:09:59,650
- The fucker set us up!
- It's not a trap, darling.

656
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:02,330
It's a gift. A sacrifice.

657
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:04,690
Sarah.

658
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:12,770
The locals came
to avenge their dead children.

659
01:10:14,730 --> 01:10:16,850
They killed her in her own bed.

660
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:19,050
What the fuck is that?

661
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:25,330
But Pierre managed to escape.

662
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:29,250
What are you talking about?
I don't care.

663
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:31,410
I don't want to die here.

664
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:34,010
Masks of shame.

665
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:37,090
Intended to punish.

666
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:43,850
No!

667
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:49,810
Don't be afraid, Tina.

668
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:52,890
She will guide us.

669
01:10:57,450 --> 01:10:59,450
What? What?

670
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:10,850
Join us, Tina.

671
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:13,170
No, no!

672
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:15,330
Join us, Tina.

673
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:22,690
Join us, Tina.

674
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,490
Get off me!

675
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:45,050
Ben, get off me!

676
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:47,290
Let me go!

677
01:11:48,650 --> 01:11:50,890
- Ben!
- We cannot stay here.

678
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:54,090
I'm going to kill you, my love.

679
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:56,010
Don't be afraid.

680
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:58,330
Ben, let me go!
I don't want to die here. No!

681
01:11:59,290 --> 01:12:01,810
Don't worry. I shall die as well.

682
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:04,930
Ben, this isn't you!

683
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:09,570
Don't fight it, Tina.

684
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:13,090
This is our chance
to be part of something.

685
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:15,290
Something much bigger than us.

686
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:30,810
- Tina?
- Yes?

687
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:33,610
- Yes, my love. I'm here.
- What happened?

688
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:38,810
We're out of time.
We need to go now.

689
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:41,970
Ok. There's a passageway above us.
Maybe it's the way out.

690
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:45,410
- Ok.
- Count your breath, baby. Ok?

691
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:51,530
No!

692
01:13:01,090 --> 01:13:02,610
Ben!

693
01:13:08,570 --> 01:13:10,090
Oh, no.
