1
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,970
My day-to-day life at that
time was a complete mess.

2
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,210
I can't say it was the fault of youth.

3
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,020
I was a student at a music college,
but I had a part-time job delivering copy.

4
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,390
A certain girl referred me to it, and I
was extremely well-suited to the job.

5
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,420
Some punk like you had a wreck.

6
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,980
Flirting with his girl and not watching
the road. Lucky he's not dead.

7
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,460
This poor old man's gonna be though.

8
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,530
Listen! Get it there in an hour!
You're fired if you don't!

9
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,100
The accident outline and the film.

10
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,300
Thanks.

11
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:48,210
Hello, hello. Yeah. Yeah. What? When?
This morning? Did you check around?

12
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,010
Please excuse me.

13
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,160
Just cigarettes? Cheeky.

14
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,720
Thank you.

15
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,090
Thanks.

16
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,360
- Thanks.
- Hey, come here!

17
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,870
You said you'd fix it before the last case!

18
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,600
I'm gonna be late!

19
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,900
Whatever.

20
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,750
Hey, Hashimoto.

21
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,150
Yeah?

22
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,120
Take responsibility for my sister.

23
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,700
- What do you mean?
- What are you gonna do?

24
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,830
I didn't say you could break up with her.

25
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,010
It's between Fuyumi-san and I.

26
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,240
Shut up!

27
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,410
You put the moves on her.

28
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,820
She was a virgin.

29
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:00,010
She wouldn't have ridden off with someone
unless they put the moves on her.

30
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,720
I'll give you two or three days, got it?

31
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,960
Think hard!

32
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,620

59
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:04,340
Some guys have vividly colored dreams,
but mine were always in monochrome.

60
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,610
This story is one of
those monochrome dreams.

61
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,380
What's up?

62
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,820
Sorry.

63
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,000
It was like she was
carried there by the wind.

64
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,030
Summer would arrive very soon.

65
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,630
What's up?

66
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,170
It's beautiful.

67
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,670
It was gonna crush you.

68
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,070
It was so beautiful that I had to touch it.

69
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,310
So what do you call it?

70
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,580
A motorbike.

71
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,090
Ka-wa-sa-ki.

72
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,390
650RSW3.

73
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,890
Want some?

74
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,670
No thanks. How about some tea?

75
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,060
It's cold.

76
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,040
Is that right?

77
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,040
Kawasaki-san!

78
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,730
Where are you from?

79
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,890
Tokyo.

80
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,800
Did you ride that Kawasaki?

81
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,100
I did.

82
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,340
You did.

83
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,110
I'll send you the pictures.

84
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,510
That's alright.

85
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,220
But they've got both you and the bike.

86
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,110
Probably out of focus.

87
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,760
Where are you heading today?

88
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,230
Looking for the wind, and then taking a nap.

89
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,970
I actually wanted to stay with her a
bit longer, but I took off on my bike.

90
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,780
This trip was for me to
think about another girl.

91
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,690
Gotta do it.

92
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,830
Please let me ride on the back
of that big bike! -Fuyumi Sawada

93
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,670
I got your letter, Fuyumi.

94
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,540
You can ride if you want.

95
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,580
It's a Kawasaki 650RSW3.

96
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,170
Are you Hashimoto-san?

97
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,570
I'm Fuyumi.

98
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,480
Wow.

99
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,710
Thanks for the note.

100
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,090
- Why do you want to ride a motorbike?
- I just do.

101
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,520
Not too big?

102
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,960
My brother has a Kawasaki too.

103
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,890
- What model?
- 650-W1 .

104
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,830
- Why can't you ride with him?
- There's no way he'd let me touch it.

105
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,500
- Alright. You can ride.
- Really? I'm glad.

106
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,070
I was really happy when I got your note.

107
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,620
How old's your brother?

108
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,360
Twenty-seven.

109
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,000
He uses his motorbike for work.

110
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,200
- How so?
- He's a copy delivery man.

111
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,590
Delivery man? What do you mean?

112
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,910
He started a company with his friends.

113
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,250
See ya!

114
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,710
Damn that asshole!

115
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,910
Hop off!

116
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,160
Undress!

117
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,490
Hurry up!

118
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,670
Take 'em off!

119
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,570
- Underwear too!
- No!

120
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,870
Undress!

121
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,670
Whatever!

122
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,180
Stay here.

123
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,950
Wait. . .wait. . .

124
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,530
What should we do?

125
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,960
I dunno.

126
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,000
What do you want to do?

127
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,730
Whatever you want.

128
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,580
Be gentle.

129
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,030
What's wrong?

130
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,070
Regret it?

131
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,900
Don't cry then!

132
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,670
It's just. . .

133
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,010
I thought I would be smiling.

134
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,550
I thought I'd smile, but I'm crying.

135
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,650
Then don't try to smile.

136
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,880
- But. . .
- You've been crying over an hour already.

137
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,390
Cut it out.

138
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,200
Come on, don't cry.

139
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,570
I'll be gentle.

140
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,070
Really?

141
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,070
Re-al-ly.

142
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,380
Then, is it alright to fall in love?

143
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,380
Yeah. You can fall in love.

144
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,320
Gotta do it.

145
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,660
It's really coming down.

146
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,550
Sorry!

147
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,460
Oh?!

148
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,730
Taking a bath after your nap?

149
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,530
Well. . .

150
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,640
What about the Kawasaki?

151
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,670
It's. . .outside.

152
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,140
Won't it get soaked?

153
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,480
Totally.

154
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:07,980
How sad.

155
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,330
I'm taking the Koumi line tomorrow.

156
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,390
Yeah?

157
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,930
All the way from Komoro to Kobuchizawa.

158
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,840
Then comes the Chuo Main Line.

159
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,140
You've taken it?

160
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,410
Nope.

161
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,160
Well, I'm getting out.

162
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,170
Two happy coincidences. . .

163
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:04,010
It felt just like I was in a story.

164
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,310
Hey.

165
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,850
Where will you go now?

166
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,190
- Looking for the wind again?
- Something like that.

167
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,330
I'm staying at an inn nearby.

168
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,720
- Want me to take you?
- On the Kawasaki?

169
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,030
My gift to you.

170
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,320
This is great!

171
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,430
The best!

172
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,290
- Thank you.
- See ya.

173
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,130
What were you saying before?

174
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,430
I said, 'This is great!''

175
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,260
Oh.

176
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,810
- I'll send you the pictures.
- Right.

177
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,340
The painful trip turned into a happy memory.

178
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,960
It allowed me to get over my broken heart.

179
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,130
I went back to Tokyo to
break up with Fuyumi.

180
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,800
I just want to be with you.

181
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,180
So I ended up having to duel her brother.

182
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,590
I thought it was a bit
childish, but so be it.

183
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,900
It's a bit early, but wanna get started?

184
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,110
Well?

185
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,580
Fine with me.

186
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,550
Whatever happens, I don't want
to hear any complaints, got it?

187
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,130
Alright.

188
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,300
Somehow I managed to win.

189
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:50,440
Going up against the boss
is saying farewell to your job.

190
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,810
But since it was a duel with no grudges
there was no need for me to quit.

191
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,650
That's what Fuyumi's
brother said afterwards.

192
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:01,480
I heard it from Fuyumi herself.

193
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,750
Michikusa

194
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,360
Rain

195
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,430
Wind

196
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,810
Storm

197
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,540
Lightning

198
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:33,710
I saw Fuyumi again a week after the duel.

199
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,820
I went to meet the girl I'd broken up with.

200
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,690
It already seemed like ancient history.

201
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,050
Yo.

202
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,320
Doing well?

203
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,290
Yes.

204
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,960
Fuyumi was the one who called me to meet.

205
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,770
To choose Michikusa, a place where we had
so many memories. . . that was just like her.

206
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,970
I had taken Fuyumi to the hospital.

207
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,310
She came to return the money
for her brother's medical bills.

208
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:10,180
My brother said to pay you back.

209
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,620
But a man can't take back
something once it's given.

210
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,290
Listen up everyone!

211
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,690
I'm paying the rest of
the tabs! It's a party!

212
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,870
Everything's on me tonight!

213
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,120
It's goodbye to this place, too.

214
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,680
You can come back anytime.

215
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,110
Don't worry about me.

216
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:47,950
No, that's alright.

217
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,760
Goodbye to the motorbike as well.

218
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:58,100
You got some good practice
for riding by yourself.

219
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,570
No, I. . .

220
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,270
I was happy just riding behind you.

221
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:12,880
If we happen to meet again somewhere. . .

222
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:16,420
. . .will you say hello?

223
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,360
I will. But what if you're
on your motorbike?

224
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,720
You can wave then.

225
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,790
Right.

226
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,920
What if it's late?

227
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,660
How late?

228
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,840
What would you say at 1 1?

229
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:36,970
I'd say good night.

230
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,850
What a party.

231
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:59,960
Everything I have was saved little
by little for a brighter tomorrow.

232
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,660
510,000 yen.

233
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:13,210
I took on more than I could handle

234
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:19,620
But you were there to hold me up

235
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,990
Wow, she's good.

236
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,520
That girl can sing.

237
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,090
That song. . .

238
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,230
Huh? What about it?

239
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:38,640
Sometimes Fuyumi would write lyrics
in a notebook while I wrote her songs.

240
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,770
It's sentimental just like you.

241
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,930
Idiot!

242
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:49,100
Things like that are meant to be treasured.

243
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:57,120
I bought a diary

244
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:04,890
Blue blots of sadness

245
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,890
Why'd you break up with
a great girl like her?

246
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,990
It was boring.

247
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:17,380
All she knew was crying and cooking.

248
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,110
A guy couldn't do better, could he?

249
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:38,100
And I. . .

250
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:49,070
I couldn't be yours

251
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,880
Go after her.

252
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,220
If you don't, I will.

253
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,550
Do what you want.

254
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,860
You're supposed to stand up and
say something at a time like this.

255
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:28,480
That was a bit cruel, Ko.

256
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,110
Also. . .

257
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,150
You need to take all this money back.

258
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:43,150
You really love your motorbike.

259
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,230
I knew it from the moment I saw it.

260
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,930
I was so jealous.

261
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,100
To be loved to that degree. . .

262
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,700
Why do you ride?

263
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,870
The heart is a willful thing.

264
00:33:56,210 --> 00:34:00,240
By the time something from the past is
buried, another story has already begun.

265
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,280
Because I'm bored.

266
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,580
And because I'm bored,
I do everything my way.

267
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,150
I cheat my way through it all.

268
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,850
Even music.

269
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:16,560
Riding the motorbike is the only thing
I couldn't cheat my way through.

270
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,090
When you do that, it comes
back on you in the end.

271
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:23,670
Always. So I ride.

272
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,570
I'm bored too.

273
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:32,170
Somehow I felt it clearly
after reading your letter.

274
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,740
My life is the same old same old.

275
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,920
I guess it's fine if you can live with that,

276
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:44,150
but that seems so far away
from where I am now.

277
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,950
What should I do?

278
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:55,660
- Oh? You're home?
- I'm here!

279
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,340
I thought I'd try giving you a call.

280
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,430
Where are you?

281
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:00,600
Nishinomiya.

282
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,640
Violet Apartments?

283
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,340
- You knew that off the top of your head?
- Of course I did.

284
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,970
Hey, how do you read your name?

285
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:10,670
Isao?

286
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,210
Ko.

287
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,750
I'm Miiyo.

288
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:15,850
Right.

289
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,850
I shortened Miyoko to Miiyo.

290
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:18,850
I see.

291
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,850
It's got a nice sound.

292
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:22,550
Ko.

293
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,990
What are you doing?

294
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,590
Getting undressed.

295
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,520
I'm naked right now!

296
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,930
It's so hot.

297
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,900
- But autumn's coming early this year.
- Yeah?

298
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,810
- It's awful.
- Why?

299
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,170
- Because summer's the best.
- I agree!

300
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,140
How old are you, Miiyo?

301
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:44,050
- I just turned twenty-two.
- We're the same age, too.

302
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,680
- Today's my birthday.
- How about that!

303
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,750
Time sure does fly.

304
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,150
Happy birthday!

305
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,990
- Should I sing you a song?
- Sing!

306
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,180
Hold on.

307
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:22,520
I'm riding, yeah, looking for the wind

308
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:35,200
I am light, yeah, I am sound

309
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:46,110
When you and I ride together

310
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:54,380
The whole world gently shines

311
00:36:55,220 --> 00:37:03,290
We are the wind

312
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:17,870
- I love you
- I love you

313
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:21,040
That's beautiful! What do you call it?

314
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:24,280
'The Song of the Wind.'' I just wrote it.

315
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,050
I just thought of something good too.

316
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,880
What is it?

317
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,560
Want to come to my island?

318
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,380
Your island?

319
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:37,490
My island in the Inland Sea.

320
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,870
I'm going home for Obon soon.

321
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,630
An island?

322
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:48,530
Why not show your Kawasaki the Bon dance?

323
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,970
Yeah.

324
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:16,460
To tell the truth, I didn't yet
long for her at that time.

325
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,800
What I longed for was that island.

326
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,170
Ko!

327
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,010
Ko! Ko!

328
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,400
Ko!

329
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,410
Ko!

330
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,280
Ko!

331
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:49,160
- You really came on the Kawasaki, huh?
- That's right.

332
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,760
What are you drinking?

333
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,090
Club soda.

334
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:56,070
For some reason I feel like
drinking it in the summer.

335
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:02,830
What a sound.

336
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,300
The sound of love.

337
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,720
Life on the island was fun.

338
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:20,950
I lost myself in it before I knew it.
I felt completely alive.

339
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,790
My greatest pleasure was putting
Miiyo on the motorbike.

340
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:32,640
She said she only had her small-size license
from when she was 1 6, but she had potential.

341
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:36,010
I felt very close to this strange girl.

342
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:48,450
That's the first time I've
driven a 650cc! What a thrill!

343
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,050
- You were great.
- Really?

344
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:54,020
- The important thing's not being afraid.
- But I was. I'm not used to it yet.

345
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:56,620
Keep riding. You can use
the throttle a bit more.

346
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,090
OK.

347
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,020
Wow!

348
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:27,620
That good?

349
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:30,290
- Yeah, from what I've seen.
- Teach me more!

350
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,690
- The writing on the tank. . .
- Oh, Kawasaki?

351
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,600
- Read the first three letters.
- K, A, W.

352
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:36,960
Read it like English.

353
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,200
Kao. . .Kou. . .

354
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:39,600
My name!

355
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:50,180
On such a small island, the priest
can't get by on donations.

356
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:54,520
He's the principal of the
elementary school too.

357
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,650
- Relax.
- Alright.

358
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,330
Have a drink.

359
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,960
Thank you.

360
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,730
Sure is hard to make a living.

361
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,230
I'll pour.

362
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:22,080
What a shame that Miyoko's
mother died when she was young.

363
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:28,950
Maybe I shouldn't have spoiled
her so much. Now she's spoiled rotten.

364
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,610
Sorry I'm spoiled.

365
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:48,670
Well, they say clothes make the man.

366
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,140
Right, dear?

367
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,670
You look just like her. . .

368
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,170
- Going to the Bon dance?
- Yeah. Let's go, Ko!

369
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,310
Alright, I'll go too!

370
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:27,110
Let's go, let's go!

371
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:31,110
Ko, come on! Let's go, Miyoko!
Come on, come on! Let's go, let's go!

372
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:58,870
Hey, let me sing!

373
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:00,530
Sure!

374
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:55,430
Come on, dance!

375
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,870
- That's alright. I'll just watch.
- You can't just watch!

376
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,970
What's that?

377
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:09,380
The people who were born,
lived, and died on this island.

378
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,850
My mother is there too.

379
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,830
- Is this the pilgrim's song?
- That's right.

380
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:30,430
- You dance to the pilgrim's song?
- We do.

381
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:34,500
Obon's the one time a year
the dead return to this world.

382
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:37,840
We have to welcome them
with a lively song and dance.

383
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,690
- Miiyo!
- Huh?

384
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:54,350
I totally understand why
you are the way you are.

385
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,580
Why?

386
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:59,260
Because you were raised in a place
that dances to the pilgrim's song.

387
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:00,490
I'm carefree?

388
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,930
It's great!

389
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,280
It's already been three days.

390
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,840
You're going home tomorrow, aren't you?

391
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,180
Time sure does fly.

392
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,850
We'll be old before we know it.

393
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:32,720
Ko, you really love your
Kawasaki motorbike, right?

394
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:34,790
I do.

395
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:37,900
I was so jealous the first
time I saw it in Shinshu.

396
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,370
- It was written on your face.
- On my whole body!

397
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:44,840
- It's my sweetheart.
- And me?

398
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,480
- You're beautiful.
- That's it?

399
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:48,970
It's love.

400
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:54,350
Don't be jealous. You're no
match for 53 horsepower.

401
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,440
I want to be able to ride it.

402
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:59,320
You have your 125cc license,
so your mid-size is next.

403
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:01,590
Then the 750cc. Think I can do it?

404
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,060
Yeah, I know you've got it in you.

405
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,190
You think so?

406
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,720
I do.

407
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,330
Now it's perfect.

408
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,900
Sleep with me.

409
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:20,140
My time on the island passed
in the blink of an eye.

410
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:22,910
It was such a short summer.

411
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:29,310
Don't zone out and drop it!

412
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,350
- What happened?
- Uh, well. . .

413
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:04,020
Zoning out because summer's over?

414
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:07,320
Sawada-san!

415
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,520
Don't say a word.

416
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:15,630
Move your body like this.

417
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,200
There's no bad blood anymore.

418
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:23,730
Fuyumi left.

419
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:27,010
I'm already used to being alone.

420
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:31,140
Hello?

421
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,480
Sure.

422
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:35,880
Ko, it's for you.

423
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:37,180
Thanks.

424
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,280
Miiyo!

425
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:44,160
An unusual autumn began.

426
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,930
A very long and strange autumn.

427
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,000
It's right here.

428
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,050
Ah, that's right.

429
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:09,710
I gave you a spare key.

430
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,920
Been a long time since I've
been here. It's so dreary.

431
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,530
- My heart is full, though.
- What the hell does that mean?

432
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,820
Thought I'd put on a record,
but you don't have anything good.

433
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,520
Why do you only have Chopin?

434
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,370
I had more, but everyone took them.

435
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,100
This is all that's left?

436
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:28,670
Yep.

437
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:32,600
That's perfect. You were always a romantic.

438
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:34,710
- I'm a pragmatist.
- Oh, shut up.

439
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:38,780
Would a pragmatist deliver
copy on a Kawasaki W3?

440
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:41,250
I guess you don't mind
that it's hard to use.

441
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,320
I'm Miyoko Shiraishi.

442
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,120
Keiichi Ogawa.

443
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,520
- So what brings you here?
- I need to talk to you.

444
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:54,060
- About what?
- I'm writing a song for graduation.

445
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,820
- Yeah?
- What about you?

446
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:58,860
I'm failing, so I'll have to repeat a year.

447
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:00,970
It's called Sunday Driver.

448
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,600
It's about a guy obsessed with motorbikes.

449
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,010
This guy goes on Sunday drives
on four boring old wheels.

450
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,940
He keeps seeing this motorbike.

451
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:10,770
It's always the same one.

452
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,410
Eventually he starts longing for it.

453
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:17,620
He ends up leaving his lover behind
so he can fly off on that motorbike.

454
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:22,820
- So I've got a favor to ask.
- What is it?

455
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,800
It's not a big deal. You hungry?

456
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:27,260
Yeah.

457
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,430
- Let's go eat.
- I'm starving too.

458
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:32,900
Alright, we'll wait downstairs
while you get changed.

459
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,910
Who's she?

460
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:45,180
A friend.

461
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:48,550
- But you and I are friends.
- Can't compare the two.

462
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,220
What happened to the girl from last year?

463
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:55,260
- The girl you were with in Shinshu.
- She got married.

464
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:57,200
So you got dumped.

465
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,860
No way!

466
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:02,460
Anything now?

467
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,570
- There's a girl.
- What's she like?

468
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:08,670
She's just your average girl.

469
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:10,000
And what's average?

470
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,640
She's the boring type.

471
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:16,910
- What about your girl?
- Mine?

472
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,080
I don't even know if
she thinks I'm her man.

473
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,380
Whatever she thinks is fine, right?

474
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:28,520
Yeah, so don't say that she's my girl.

475
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:31,520
We're both just trying to escape boredom.

476
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,930
It's like we're walking on
a tightrope above it.

477
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:37,200
That's how it is, huh?

478
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:40,770
That's just how girls are.

479
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:43,240
If they weren't. . .

480
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:47,470
It would just be a seesaw game
of trying to love and be loved.

481
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:49,610
Thanks for waiting.

482
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,380
So where are we going?

483
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:58,690
- Hmm. . .
- How about Michikusa?

484
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,190
Michikusa, huh?

485
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:02,720
It's been a long time.

486
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:04,050
Michikusa?

487
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,030
Where the music school students go.

488
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:07,530
- I wanna go!
- Yeah.

489
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:27,410
I took on more than I could handle

490
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:29,450
Hey!

491
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,450
What's up?

492
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:35,890
You said I was lighter than expected

493
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,930
Three glasses!

494
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:47,600
Changed the color of my
lipstick, cut my fingernails

495
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,640
To record those days full of love

496
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:56,470
I bought a diary

497
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,290
- Surprised?
- Yep.

498
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:06,490
I persuaded her to be our exclusive singer.

499
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:08,360
Today's her first day.

500
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:10,160
Can I get an onion pizza?

501
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,850
- One for me too.
- Me too.

502
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,770
And you. . .

503
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:23,170
You weren't mine

504
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:26,210
And I. . .

505
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:33,280
I couldn't be yours

506
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:37,750
Great song, huh?

507
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,890
I wrote the music and gave
it a title. ''Sunshine Girl.''

508
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,060
Hello.

509
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,300
Hello.

510
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:56,470
Hello. I'm Miiyo.

511
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:59,240
I just came to Tokyo today.
Nice to meet you.

512
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,100
Nice to meet you.

513
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:03,970
I'm Fuyumi.

514
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:05,740
Heading out? It's 3,500 yen.

515
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:09,250
Why don't we toast the new beginnings
for these two beautiful girls?

516
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,520
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

517
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,330
So what did you think of ''Sunshine Girl?''

518
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,590
A lot different from my version.

519
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:22,460
The music changes with the creator.

520
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:23,890
Sorry for the wait.

521
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,500
The girl changes as well.

522
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:33,070
Ko, what was your version
of ''Sunshine Girl'' like?

523
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,410
I can't remember.

524
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,210
I have the sheet music.

525
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:49,690
Well then, why don't I sing it?

526
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,300
You did it?

527
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:06,700
I did it.

528
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,700
That night?

529
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:10,240
That night.

530
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,140
We live together now.

531
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:24,460
I took on more than I could handle

532
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:30,000
But you were there to hold me up

533
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:36,030
You said I was lighter than expected

534
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,580
As you held me tightly

535
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,480
- She's not bad, is she?
- She's not bad.

536
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,610
Still crying?

537
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:49,980
Not at all.

538
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,490
Cooking?

539
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:52,850
Of course.

540
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:59,430
To record those days full of love

541
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,600
Now I understand why you left me behind.

542
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:10,040
You were looking for a girl like her.

543
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,180
She's a great girl.

544
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:17,840
Hearts change as well

545
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:20,850
And you. . .

546
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:26,460
You weren't mine

547
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:29,790
And I. . .

548
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:38,600
I couldn't be yours

549
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,750
So what are we doing?

550
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:01,650
Just shut up for about two
hours and stay behind me.

551
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,920
I'll pick out cars.

552
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:08,860
We'll pull up beside them when
there's not much traffic,

553
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:11,160
then I'll take out the right side mirrors.

554
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:16,500
Get behind me after I do it so they'll have
trouble remembering the plate number.

555
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,900
Why are we doing this?

556
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:21,640
I ended up wanting to try it
as I was writing the song.

557
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,170
I see.

558
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,880
Don't run over them after they
fly off, or you'll go flying too.

559
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:30,150
Got it.

560
01:00:58,460 --> 01:00:59,590
Wasn't that fun?

561
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:01,890
Are you inspired now?

562
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:03,260
Plenty.

563
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:13,870
Miiyo!

564
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:18,950
I think I was pressing too hard on
the shifter. I mis-shifted four times.

565
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:19,980
Miiyo, you. . .

566
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:21,710
I was behind you the whole time.

567
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:25,010
I knew my first time riding
through Tokyo would be scary.

568
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:28,990
You idiot! Didn't you say you
only had your small-size license?

569
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,090
So why are you riding a 250cc?

570
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:35,100
- Don't you know how dangerous that is?
- Sorry!

571
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:38,300
I made sure she was
capable before we met up.

572
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,600
She was great. I wouldn't have
let her if it was dangerous.

573
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:43,430
The helmet and motorbike are mine.

574
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:48,140
- When did you plan this?
- Yesterday. It's alright, she's fine.

575
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:49,970
It's not alright!

576
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:51,740
Let's head inside.

577
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:06,820
Hey!

578
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:16,410
Well, I'm going to go warm up.

579
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:19,230
Welcome.

580
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:24,750
- What?
- Look.

581
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,480
I got it in Nishinomiya last month.

582
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:31,150
Mid-size license.

583
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:36,530
I said I wanted to ride with you.

584
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:48,000
Let's go outside.

585
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:17,830
In Shinshu. . .

586
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:21,060
When I saw you on top of that Kawasaki. . .

587
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,760
I was so jealous.

588
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:26,840
I envied that Kawasaki.
I wanted to ride it myself.

589
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:29,870
And I wanted to be loved
as much as that Kawasaki.

590
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:32,270
Miiyo. . .

591
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,360
Sorry about before.

592
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:45,090
I went to a driving school as soon
as I got back from Shinshu.

593
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:51,260
Motorbikes were the only things that weren't
boring, just like you said in your letter.

594
01:03:56,810 --> 01:03:58,140
Let's go touring together.

595
01:03:58,540 --> 01:03:59,600
Really?

596
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:01,480
It's the perfect season.

597
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,610
I'm so happy!

598
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:16,090
The R takes curves in a similar way.

599
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:19,200
It's different when you
have a blind curve though.

600
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:20,420
Got it.

601
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:22,300
Don't fly into the curves either.

602
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:23,630
Too much throttle?

603
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:24,690
Downshift.

604
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,130
It's better to be in a low gear than high.

605
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,330
Why?

606
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:30,740
It's easier to accelerate
if something happens.

607
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:35,180
Enter the curb slowly, then accelerate to
an appropriate speed as you come out.

608
01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:36,370
OK.

609
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:47,460
You're doing pretty well.

610
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:50,430
Really? I want to ride that Kawasaki soon.

611
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:52,390
Be patient, be patient.

612
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,490
Not happening on that mid-size license.

613
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:15,440
Your island was great, Miiyo.

614
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:17,380
Of course.

615
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:20,390
- But why do you say that?
- It's wide-open.

616
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:21,550
- The island?
- Right.

617
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,260
But it's tiny.

618
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:28,530
- It's surrounded by the sea, so it's open.
- Why is that good?

619
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:33,030
If a place isn't, then sometimes
the wind stops completely.

620
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,430
Is the wind blowing now?

621
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:38,140
It is. The storm is raging.

622
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:06,140
Everyone performed for our sakes.

623
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:39,570
Those secret words

624
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:46,570
- I love you
- I love you

625
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:52,310
Ko, why I am here?

626
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:55,920
I wanted to ask you the same thing.

627
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:00,420
Our tent is right over there.

628
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:06,700
And inside is our sleeping bag.

629
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:10,320
Let's lie down.

630
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:13,190
Then we can do it.

631
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:17,400
Yeah!

632
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:37,150
Soon after that we were at the racetrack
with Fuyumi's brother's group.

633
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:46,930
Want to ride this one?

634
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:51,880
- Why don't you give it a try?
- Really?

635
01:07:58,050 --> 01:08:00,480
Upshift at 3000 rpm to keep it at 1 500.

636
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,690
Cut into the curves,
but don't lean too much.

637
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:05,650
Here!

638
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:22,560
Alright.

639
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,010
There you go!

640
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:35,700
That's a good time.

641
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:37,340
It's so powerful!

642
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:42,450
- You look like you haven't had enough yet.
- I haven't.

643
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:45,320
Alright, one more lap.

644
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:46,950
Fly!

645
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:03,830
I got a call from Fuyumi the other day.

646
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:09,070
She said she's seeing a guy named Ogawa.

647
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:10,610
Never met him.

648
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:14,750
But I could tell from her voice
that she was doing well.

649
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:27,430
She rides beautifully.

650
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:31,070
How long has she been riding?

651
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:33,200
About three months.

652
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:37,340
Three months?

653
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,310
She got her mid-size license
at the end of the summer.

654
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:49,010
She's gonna die.

655
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:53,160
She's one of those motorbike prodigies.

656
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:56,220
People like you just don't have the gift.

657
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:01,630
If you don't want to kill her,
then get her off of them.

658
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:09,040
Ko, when can I get my 750cc license?

659
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:10,330
Beginning of spring.

660
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:12,510
Ugh! I want it now.

661
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:14,610
You should slow down.

662
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:15,770
I want it now.

663
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:17,610
- No way.
- Why not?

664
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:22,680
It's alright if you don't understand.
You'll have it in time for summer touring.

665
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:25,610
I hate the rain.

666
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:28,190
- Why?
- You can't teach me.

667
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:30,880
- The rain is nice.
- Why?

668
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,930
I don't get to be with you
like this very often.

669
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:39,470
Hello? What?!

670
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:41,500
I'm on my way.

671
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:43,000
Work?

672
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:44,630
Murata-san was in an accident.

673
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:46,700
I'm going to deliver the copy for him.

674
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,010
It's nearby, so I'll take the 250cc.

675
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:04,320
- Take care.
- Yeah.

676
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:07,990
What are you doing?

677
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:13,420
What are you doing riding
without your license?

678
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:16,500
I wanted to ride it.

679
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:19,770
You won't let me ride it
here with you at all.

680
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,070
- I've been busy with work.
- You have not!

681
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:25,110
You don't like me riding motorbikes!

682
01:13:25,410 --> 01:13:26,470
What?!

683
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:29,140
You're jealous because I'm
crazy about motorbikes.

684
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:30,240
Idiot!

685
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:34,150
Wearing a leather jacket out in
the fucking rain. . . Take it off!

686
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:46,120
Idiot!

687
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:48,720
Why, you!

688
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:06,950
You want to ride motorbikes that much?

689
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:08,240
I do.

690
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:11,810
You're gonna die.

691
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:15,660
I love the Kawasaki.

692
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:18,700
I wouldn't have any regrets.

693
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:27,630
Get it.

694
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,070
Your 750cc license.

695
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:34,630
Six months passed.

696
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:38,110
A lot of things can happen in six months.

697
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:42,010
First, Ogawa's baby began
to grow in Fuyumi's belly.

698
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:44,950
And after that, Miiyo left.

699
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:49,150
She had appeared out of nowhere,

700
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:52,600
so it was no surprise that
she disappeared just as suddenly.

701
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,960
But my Kawasaki went missing along with her.

702
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:00,000
It seemed she was going
to get her 750cc license.

703
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:03,060
She was going to do it alone.

704
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,280
It's like the wind has stopped completely.

705
01:15:15,490 --> 01:15:17,550
I think I'll go back to my island.

706
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:21,490
That was Miiyo's farewell letter.

707
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:28,130
It was almost summer, and I was irritated.

708
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:33,330
But for some reason I hesitated.

709
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:44,140
Asshole!

710
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:54,620
Hey! What are you doing?
Watch where you're going!

711
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:29,690
You asshole!

712
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:34,190
Huh?

713
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:44,730
- Come on! Get out here!
- Quit fucking around, dumbass!

714
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,100
Come on!

715
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:49,540
- Stop!
- My arm! My arm! My arm!

716
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:51,100
Come on!

717
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:01,190
Forgive us! Forgive us!

718
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:03,660
Please forgive us! Ow!

719
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,760
Get in there!

720
01:17:23,650 --> 01:17:27,210
- Help!
- Help us!

721
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:49,160
We've ridden this way many times.

722
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:52,870
Yeah. Feels like it's been a long time.

723
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,270
It does.

724
01:17:54,510 --> 01:17:55,810
Why do you think that is?

725
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:57,650
It's been years.

726
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:17,160
You've been acting weird lately, Ko.

727
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:21,360
You were finally in love with that one girl.

728
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:23,270
That was all there was to it.

729
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:29,210
Oh, thanks.

730
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:32,900
I'll do it.

731
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:39,120
I got a package from Miiyo yesterday.

732
01:18:39,790 --> 01:18:41,780
There were clothes for the baby inside.

733
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:45,450
And a short letter.

734
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:48,860
Baby clothes?

735
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:53,000
It's already midsummer on my island.

736
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:57,070
The sun is shining so brightly.

737
01:18:57,940 --> 01:18:59,340
The wind feels lovely.

738
01:19:00,910 --> 01:19:03,810
The Kawasaki and I are both very well.

739
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:10,020
Best wishes to the baby
in your belly and Papa.

740
01:19:12,590 --> 01:19:15,080
She didn't write anything about you.

741
01:19:16,990 --> 01:19:20,450
But it felt like it was
meant for you somehow.

742
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:25,830
Ko. . .

743
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,870
Leaving me behind may
have given you freedom.

744
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:36,000
But it seems like being separated
from Miiyo has taken it away.

745
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:42,880
Where's the Ko that I fell in love with?

746
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:50,990
How about taking a ride
to that girl's island?

747
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,600
My CB's out front.

748
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:17,540
Miiyo was waiting on the
island as I'd hoped.

749
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,190
I've been waiting here all this time.

750
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:16,440
I've kept the Kawasaki polished and with a
full tank of gas while I was waiting for you.

751
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:22,210
Have you been fooling around on me?

752
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:29,980
If I tried to fool around,
you wouldn't let me.

753
01:22:31,150 --> 01:22:32,710
There's no way I could.

754
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:36,420
Good.

755
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:47,630
Feels great.

756
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:50,130
The wind.

757
01:22:50,410 --> 01:22:51,430
Yeah.

758
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,470
Just like last year.

759
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:58,210
No way! It feels so much
better than last year.

760
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:03,620
Ko, can you do me a favor?

761
01:23:04,090 --> 01:23:05,280
Say yes.

762
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:07,510
Yes.

763
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:09,050
I want to ride.

764
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:11,990
I want us to be the wind.

765
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:16,420
Miiyo. . .

766
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:31,740
And the two of us became the wind.

767
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,280
This is what I believed:

768
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:36,680
She wasn't just a girl.

769
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:39,580
The island wasn't just an island.

770
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:41,920
She was the island.

771
01:23:42,930 --> 01:23:45,760
And at that time I became a motorbike.

772
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:52,200
She was me at that moment.

773
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,100
And I was her.

774
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:57,170
We were the same person.

775
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,670
As we played around by splitting
off onto different paths

776
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:04,410
I felt that it was the truth.

777
01:25:33,470 --> 01:25:35,730
There's a drive-in near the bridge up ahead.

778
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:37,230
I'll wait for you there.

779
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:40,300
I'll wait for you.

780
01:26:51,310 --> 01:26:54,340
Well, in the light it was about this big.

781
01:26:55,450 --> 01:26:56,540
Here you are.

782
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:01,610
Welcome. What would you like?

783
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,420
Man, it's awful.

784
01:27:03,730 --> 01:27:05,350
I saw a terrible accident.

785
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:06,660
- Where?
- What?

786
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:12,500
A good looking girl on a
two-wheeler. She was flying.

787
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:14,270
And then. . .hey! Hey!

788
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:18,570
She goes into a curve, then she
suddenly jerks the handlebars to the right.

789
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:21,310
There's a vehicle in the other lane.

790
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:24,450
In such a hurry in rain like this. . .

791
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:26,310
You could hear the tires.

792
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:29,520
Poor girl hit a truck.

793
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:34,280
It's as slick as this on rainy days.

794
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:35,520
- So smooth.
- Hey!

795
01:27:35,630 --> 01:27:36,650
So what happened?

796
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:40,990
She got dragged 50 meters. Instant death.

797
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:45,530
A hare just ran out into the road.
No need to jerk the handlebars like that.

798
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:48,170
She swerved to avoid a hare?

799
01:27:48,410 --> 01:27:49,960
Is that right?

800
01:27:50,670 --> 01:27:53,110
I was passing by on the way here.

801
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:55,210
I saw her face.

802
01:27:56,050 --> 01:27:57,980
What a good looking girl.

803
01:27:58,580 --> 01:28:02,210
- What a shame.
- Hey, did she look like us?

804
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:05,820
It would be a shame if it was either of you.

805
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:46,800
Sorry I'm late.

806
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:53,130
Miiyo. . .

807
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:55,230
I'd caught her.

808
01:28:55,870 --> 01:28:59,540
She was there from one summer to the next.

809
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:02,580
She became my story.

810
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:19,730
''What happens after we
take the photo?'' I'd ask.

811
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:23,890
''Don't ask something like that,''
she'd undoubtedly answer.

812
01:29:24,770 --> 01:29:26,900
And then the wind would blow.

813
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:28,860
It would truly be summer.

814
01:29:29,170 --> 01:29:33,270
And summer is where my heart lies.

815
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:03,330
