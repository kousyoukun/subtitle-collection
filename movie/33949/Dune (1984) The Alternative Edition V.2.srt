2
00:00:43,332 --> 00:00:50,036
In the year 6041, before the
reign of the Padishah Emperors

3
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:54,974
the Universe was ruled by thinking
machines with human minds...

4
00:00:54,975 --> 00:00:57,344
computers and conscious robots.

5
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:02,022
The people deteriorated
into a state of apathy.

6
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:23,397
Then they became victims and
slaves of other men with machines.

7
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:44,947
Finally came the Great Revolt
- the religious crusade against the machines.

8
00:01:51,598 --> 00:01:57,428
After the Great Revolt, human beings
were forced to develop their minds.

9
00:01:57,749 --> 00:02:01,349
Thus, mental training
schools were established.

10
00:02:02,124 --> 00:02:05,700
These schools would change
the history of the Universe.

11
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:12,345
Only two of these ancient
mental training schools remain.

12
00:02:12,672 --> 00:02:19,052
One is the Bene Gesserit school, which was
established primarily for female students.

13
00:02:19,053 --> 00:02:21,264
The function of the Bene Gesserit school

14
00:02:21,293 --> 00:02:26,636
is to carry on a selective
breeding program among humans.

15
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:35,882
Now the other existing school
The Spacing Guild, or The Guild

16
00:02:35,883 --> 00:02:39,352
emphasizes pure mathematics.

17
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:53,155
The Guild's space Navigators, through
the use of the orange spice drug

18
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:55,072
are able to fold space.

19
00:02:55,702 --> 00:03:00,521
That is, to guide spaceships without
moving, from one planet to another.

20
00:03:00,522 --> 00:03:05,210
It is through the Guild's monopolies
on the economic life of the Universe

21
00:03:05,402 --> 00:03:07,937
that makes it so powerful.

22
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:15,121
Know then, that it is the year 10,191.

23
00:03:16,174 --> 00:03:21,159
The known universe is ruled by
the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV.

24
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:28,459
For many years the Emperor Shaddam
IV has ruled on planet Kaitan

25
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,122
over all the Great
Houses of the Landsraad.

26
00:03:32,123 --> 00:03:37,235
The Great Houses of the Landsraad
are members of the royal families

27
00:03:37,236 --> 00:03:40,695
who rule or govern over the
major planets of the Universe

28
00:03:40,696 --> 00:03:44,458
according to the ancient
feudal system of government.

29
00:03:44,787 --> 00:03:52,114
In this time the most precious substance
in the Universe is the spice melange.

30
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:54,147
The spice extends life.

31
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:56,815
The spice expands consciousness.

32
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,358
The spice is vital to space travel.

33
00:04:01,244 --> 00:04:04,559
The CHOAM company controls
the mining of the spice.

34
00:04:05,394 --> 00:04:10,845
The CHOAM company is controlled
by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV

35
00:04:10,846 --> 00:04:12,797
and the Great Houses of the Landsraad

36
00:04:14,562 --> 00:04:18,667
with the Guild and the Bene
Gesserit as silent partners.

37
00:04:22,465 --> 00:04:27,653
This combine is the key to the wealth
and political power of the Universe.

38
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:35,158
The spice exists on only one
planet in the entire Universe.

39
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:39,550
A desolate, dry planet
with vast deserts.

40
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,282
The planet Dune.

41
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:45,725
Also known as Arrakis.

42
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:13,287
We are the secret of the Universe.

43
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:16,480
Bi-la kaifa.

44
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,718
We are the secret.

45
00:05:21,172 --> 00:05:25,040
We know of CHOAM in the Universe

46
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:29,324
Combine Honnete Ober Advance Mercantiles

47
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:32,566
controlled by the Emperor Shaddam IV

48
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:36,425
and all the Great
Houses of the Landsraad.

49
00:05:37,277 --> 00:05:43,555
We know of CHOAM...yet
we are the secret.

50
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,110
We know of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood

51
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:52,392
their selective breeding
plan for 90 generations

52
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:58,842
to produce the Kwisatz
Haderach, whom they will control.

53
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:08,070
The ones they call the
witches...yet we are the secret.

54
00:06:08,563 --> 00:06:13,937
We know of the Guild and their
Navigators' power to fold space

55
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:18,281
and their control over
all interplanetary travel.

56
00:06:20,248 --> 00:06:28,026
We know they have they seeing
eye...yet we are the secret.

57
00:06:29,383 --> 00:06:36,667
The Bakka shall weep no more, for
there is now at work a higher power.

58
00:06:36,668 --> 00:06:38,893
Bi-la kaifa.

59
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:47,146
And now

60
00:06:47,244 --> 00:06:49,424
the prophecy.

61
00:06:50,316 --> 00:06:53,170
One will come,

62
00:06:54,095 --> 00:06:57,286
the voice from the outer world,

63
00:06:57,287 --> 00:07:00,239
bringing the holy war,

64
00:07:01,152 --> 00:07:03,069
the Jihad,

65
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,730
which will cleanse the Universe

66
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:09,492
and bring us out of darkness.

67
00:08:36,368 --> 00:08:39,079
Four planets have come to our attention

68
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,349
regarding a plot which could
jeopardise spice production.

69
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:47,108
Planet Arrakis: source of the spice.

70
00:08:47,973 --> 00:08:51,541
Planet Caladan: home of House Atreides.

71
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:56,139
Planet Giedi Prime:
home of House Harkonnen.

72
00:08:56,896 --> 00:09:02,082
Planet Kaitain: home of the
Emperor of the known Known Universe.

73
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:09,255
Send a third-stage Guild Navigator to
Kaitain to demand details from the Emperor.

74
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:13,449
The spice must flow.

75
00:09:58,548 --> 00:09:59,588
Father?

76
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:01,706
Irulan, you must leave.

77
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,411
Why does the Guild send a
third-stage Navigator here?

78
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:30,076
Spice! It has to be.

79
00:10:31,523 --> 00:10:34,167
He senses my plan.

80
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:40,975
My Lord...

81
00:10:40,976 --> 00:10:42,885
The Reverend Mother is here.

82
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:45,720
All entrance corridors and
chambers have been cleared.

83
00:10:46,151 --> 00:10:47,390
We are dismissed?

84
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:49,233
Yes, yes, he'll sense any surveillance.

85
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:52,025
No eavesdropping of any kind!

86
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:08,280
A third-stage Guild Navigator
will be here within minutes.

87
00:11:08,953 --> 00:11:11,609
We felt his presence.

88
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,775
I shall want telepathy during his visit

89
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,700
and a report when we're finished.

90
00:11:15,701 --> 00:11:19,452
Their minds are so...

91
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:25,820
they move in strange directions.

92
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:27,514
Yes?

93
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,980
Forced spice evolution of
humans changes many things.

94
00:11:34,197 --> 00:11:36,134
I must sit close to him.

95
00:11:36,164 --> 00:11:39,332
He will not permit anyone but me to
see him. You must be outside this room.

96
00:11:39,603 --> 00:11:41,768
I am your Truthsayer, my Lord.

97
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,600
Here's here, my Lord.

98
00:12:13,113 --> 00:12:16,691
The Bene Gesserit witch must leave.

99
00:12:17,774 --> 00:12:19,096
Leave us.

100
00:12:20,784 --> 00:12:22,170
Yes, my Lord.

101
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:24,072
We have just folded space from Ix.

102
00:13:24,073 --> 00:13:26,646
Yes? How was your journey?

103
00:13:27,248 --> 00:13:32,850
Many machines on Ix. New machines.

104
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,452
Oh? Yes?

105
00:13:37,042 --> 00:13:40,333
Better than those on Richese.

106
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:47,141
You are transparent. I see many things.

107
00:13:47,142 --> 00:13:50,695
I see plans within plans...

108
00:13:51,362 --> 00:13:56,741
Is there a problem? Usually there's a
problem when one of you makes a visit.

109
00:13:57,602 --> 00:14:01,009
The answer is within the problem.

110
00:14:02,537 --> 00:14:05,048
I see two Great Houses

111
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:10,258
House Atreides, House
Harkonnen, feuding.

112
00:14:10,965 --> 00:14:14,464
I see you behind it.

113
00:14:14,745 --> 00:14:15,660
Yes.

114
00:14:15,661 --> 00:14:19,112
You must share with us.

115
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:25,153
The Atreides House is building a secret
army using a technique unknown to us

116
00:14:25,154 --> 00:14:27,333
a technique involving sound.

117
00:14:28,143 --> 00:14:30,895
The Duke is becoming more
popular in the Landsraad.

118
00:14:30,896 --> 00:14:32,445
He could threaten me.

119
00:14:33,017 --> 00:14:37,122
I have ordered House Atreides to
occupy Arrakis to mine the spice

120
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:40,214
thus replacing their
enemies the Harkonnens.

121
00:14:40,215 --> 00:14:41,670
House Atreides will not refuse

122
00:14:41,727 --> 00:14:44,753
because of the tremendous
power they think they will gain.

123
00:14:44,754 --> 00:14:49,626
Then, at an appointed time, Baron
Harkonnen will return to Arrakis

124
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:52,264
and launch a sneak
attack on House Atreides.

125
00:14:52,452 --> 00:14:57,447
I have promised the Baron five
legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.

126
00:14:58,014 --> 00:15:01,969
So the Harkonnens will rid
you of House Atreides...

127
00:15:02,664 --> 00:15:03,676
Yes!

128
00:15:03,677 --> 00:15:06,204
Listen to me. The spice must flow!

129
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:09,630
The spice has given me accelerated
evolution for 4000 years.

130
00:15:09,631 --> 00:15:11,777
It has enabled you to live 200!

131
00:15:11,968 --> 00:15:16,389
It gives the Bene Gesserit sisterhood
the metaphysical ability to see beyond,

132
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,095
to have superior powers.

133
00:15:19,096 --> 00:15:23,079
Our power to fold space is in the spice.

134
00:15:23,634 --> 00:15:27,997
Without us your empire would be
lost on isolated, scattered planets.

135
00:15:27,998 --> 00:15:30,043
YOU would be lost.

136
00:15:30,327 --> 00:15:32,830
One small point...

137
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:35,047
Here it comes.

138
00:15:35,048 --> 00:15:40,959
We ourselves foresee a slight
problem within the House Atreides.

139
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,283
Paul...Paul Atreides.

140
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:49,507
You mean of course Duke
Leto Atreides, his father.

141
00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:55,602
I mean Paul Atreides.
We want him killed.

142
00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:02,457
I did not say this. I am not here.

143
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:04,667
I understand.

144
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:39,802
Why would they want
the Duke's son killed?

145
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:44,120
Well?

146
00:16:44,776 --> 00:16:49,121
They fear that putting House Atreides
on Arrakis will hurt spice production.

147
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:54,231
For us, a small amount is enough
to greatly extend our lives

148
00:16:54,232 --> 00:16:56,979
but they consume tremendous quantities.

149
00:16:57,904 --> 00:17:02,201
A great deal is needed
to evolve the seeing eye.

150
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,200
They worry.

151
00:17:04,597 --> 00:17:07,560
The Universe worries when
they worry. What else?

152
00:17:08,864 --> 00:17:11,021
So much was unclear.

153
00:17:12,716 --> 00:17:14,902
You may go, Helen Mohiam

154
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,291
Bene Gesserit.

155
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,393
Yes, my Lord.

156
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,846
She's Bene Gesserit.

157
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:28,607
There's nowhere in the
Universe you can escape them.

158
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,953
Her loyalty to the sisterhood is
stronger than her loyalty to me.

159
00:17:31,954 --> 00:17:34,002
Watch her carefully.

160
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:42,852
Why would they want
the Duke's son killed?

161
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:52,105
We must have a look at
Paul Atreides, on Caladan.

162
00:18:09,016 --> 00:18:11,665
The powerful Bene Gesserit sisterhood

163
00:18:11,773 --> 00:18:13,328
for 90 generations

164
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,238
has been manipulating bloodlines

165
00:18:15,282 --> 00:18:17,776
to produce the Kwisatz Haderach.

166
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:19,580
A super being.

167
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,347
On Caladan, Jessica,

168
00:18:22,395 --> 00:18:23,455
a member of the sisterhood

169
00:18:23,471 --> 00:18:27,276
and the bound concubine
of Duke Leto Atreides

170
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,795
had been ordered to bear only daughters.

171
00:18:31,227 --> 00:18:33,253
Because of her love for the Duke,

172
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,630
she disobeyed and gave
birth to a son, Paul.

173
00:18:37,138 --> 00:18:39,384
Paul Atreides.

174
00:18:41,783 --> 00:18:45,168
Here we are now. Caladan.

175
00:18:45,496 --> 00:18:47,893
And 19 light-years beyond

176
00:18:48,207 --> 00:18:50,333
beyond Bene Tleilax

177
00:18:50,693 --> 00:18:52,369
The training planet of the Mentats,

178
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,172
the human computers.

179
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:57,169
Know a Mentat by his red-stained lips.

180
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:59,813
There, Arrakis.

181
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,814
Carryalls lower the
harvester to the sand

182
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,173
and lift it off to safety
when a worm attacks.

183
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:10,284
Worms attack all rhythmic vibrations.

184
00:19:16,747 --> 00:19:19,842
Never one drop of rain on Arrakis.

185
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,101
And the Harkonnens are near. There.

186
00:19:25,388 --> 00:19:27,586
Giedi Prime and the Baron Harkonnen.

187
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,976
The enemy.

188
00:19:29,444 --> 00:19:32,201
The Baron Harkonnen has sworn
to destroy House Atreides

189
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,517
and steal the ducal
signet ring for himself.

190
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:35,955
Saguaro

191
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,060
burrow bush

192
00:19:37,393 --> 00:19:38,301
creosote bush

193
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:39,826
barrel cactus...

194
00:19:49,297 --> 00:19:52,537
Gurney Halleck, a troubadour-warrior

195
00:19:52,572 --> 00:19:55,190
is companion and
teacher to Paul Atreides.

196
00:19:55,957 --> 00:19:57,720
Dr. Wellington Yueh,

197
00:19:57,892 --> 00:20:00,656
Royal Physician to
the House of Atreides.

198
00:20:01,062 --> 00:20:02,825
He wears the diamond tattoo

199
00:20:02,897 --> 00:20:05,229
of imperial conditioning
on his forehead.

200
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,096
This signifies that he has
had the highest conditioning

201
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:10,228
against taking human life.

202
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:14,832
Therefore, this makes him safe
enough to attend to even an emperor.

203
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:23,409
Among those who serve Duke Leto Atreides

204
00:20:23,485 --> 00:20:24,952
is Thufir Hawat,

205
00:20:25,453 --> 00:20:28,945
Mentat Master of Assassins
to the House of Atreides.

206
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:32,984
A Mentat is a human being
who is trained and conditioned

207
00:20:33,061 --> 00:20:35,529
for supreme accomplishments of logic.

208
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,990
A human computer to
perform certain duties.

209
00:20:39,634 --> 00:20:42,603
I know, Thufir, I'm sitting
with my back to the door.

210
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:47,804
I heard you, Doctor Yueh,

211
00:20:48,743 --> 00:20:50,370
and Gurney coming down the hall.

212
00:20:50,512 --> 00:20:51,911
Those sounds

213
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:54,146
could be imitated!

214
00:20:56,518 --> 00:20:58,213
I'd know the difference.

215
00:20:58,453 --> 00:21:01,445
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.

216
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:06,418
My father sent you to test me.

217
00:21:06,795 --> 00:21:08,194
Music, then?

218
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:09,728
No music.

219
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:12,831
I'm packing this for the crossing.

220
00:21:13,568 --> 00:21:14,626
Shield practice.

221
00:21:14,702 --> 00:21:15,691
Shield practice?

222
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,068
Gurney, we had practice this morning.

223
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:19,401
I'm not in the mood.

224
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:20,803
Not in the mood?

225
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:23,643
Mood's a thing for cattle and love play.

226
00:21:23,711 --> 00:21:24,769
Not fighting!

227
00:21:24,913 --> 00:21:25,680
I'm sorry, Gurney.

228
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:28,004
Not sorry enough.

229
00:21:42,497 --> 00:21:46,297
Now, guard yourself for true!

230
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,987
Is this what you seek?

231
00:22:07,689 --> 00:22:09,156
Good.

232
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:12,655
The slow blade penetrates the shield.

233
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:15,887
But, uh, look down.

234
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:21,197
We'd have joined each other in death.

235
00:22:22,237 --> 00:22:25,138
You did seem finally to get in the mood.

236
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,778
Would you really have drawn my blood?

237
00:22:35,183 --> 00:22:37,777
If you'd have fought one
whit below your abilities,

238
00:22:37,852 --> 00:22:40,787
I'd have given you a
good scar to remind you.

239
00:22:44,726 --> 00:22:46,819
Things have been so serious here lately.

240
00:22:46,961 --> 00:22:49,054
Soon we'll leave for Arrakis.

241
00:22:49,931 --> 00:22:51,523
Arrakis is real.

242
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:54,435
The Harkonnens are real.

243
00:22:56,704 --> 00:22:58,069
Doctor Yueh,

244
00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:01,404
do you have any information
on the worms of Arrakis?

245
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:05,507
I've obtained a filmbook
of a small specimen.

246
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,110
Only 125 meters long.

247
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,440
Only?

248
00:23:10,518 --> 00:23:12,748
There have been documented
sightings of worms

249
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,189
as large as 450 meters
in the deep desert.

250
00:23:17,926 --> 00:23:20,793
That's far from where
we'll be in Arrakeen.

251
00:23:21,996 --> 00:23:24,692
The desert belt and
the south polar region

252
00:23:24,766 --> 00:23:26,097
are marked forbidden.

253
00:23:26,668 --> 00:23:29,262
The storms and the worms.

254
00:23:31,139 --> 00:23:35,166
Is it true that the sand
can blow at 700 km per hour?

255
00:23:36,544 --> 00:23:39,069
It can render flesh
into dust in minutes.

256
00:23:40,214 --> 00:23:42,682
And these dry winds can also generate

257
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:46,208
tremendous amounts of static
electricity in the atmosphere.

258
00:23:46,721 --> 00:23:49,451
Our body shields won't have enough power

259
00:23:49,524 --> 00:23:51,822
to operate in the open air on Arrakis.

260
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,425
How do the Fremen survive there?

261
00:23:54,562 --> 00:23:56,427
We don't know much about the Fremen.

262
00:23:56,831 --> 00:24:00,130
They live in the deep desert,
some of them in the cities.

263
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:02,431
They have
blue-within-blue eyes.

264
00:24:02,503 --> 00:24:04,130
The eyes.

265
00:24:04,672 --> 00:24:05,730
Yes.

266
00:24:06,474 --> 00:24:09,375
Saturation of the blood
by the spice melange.

267
00:24:10,244 --> 00:24:12,303
Could the spice affect us in other ways?

268
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,610
Many dangers exist on Arrakis.

269
00:24:14,682 --> 00:24:15,671
For one,

270
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,314
the Harkonnens would not have given up

271
00:24:18,386 --> 00:24:21,378
their CHOAM Company contract so easily.

272
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,450
The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes.

273
00:24:26,661 --> 00:24:29,152
But behind them, I
suspect, is the Emperor.

274
00:24:30,565 --> 00:24:32,965
You'll make a formidable Duke.

275
00:24:38,206 --> 00:24:39,537
Now, remember,

276
00:24:40,608 --> 00:24:43,600
the first step in avoiding a trap

277
00:24:44,045 --> 00:24:46,104
is knowing of its existence.

278
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,876
I know, but if it is a trap

279
00:24:49,217 --> 00:24:50,684
then why are we going?

280
00:24:50,752 --> 00:24:52,310
We have our new army.

281
00:24:53,287 --> 00:24:54,618
Doctor Yueh,

282
00:24:55,023 --> 00:24:57,116
put the weirding module on him.

283
00:25:21,716 --> 00:25:23,411
Clear and lock the room!

284
00:25:23,484 --> 00:25:25,509
Detachment, stand down.

285
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:36,497
Activate a fighter.

286
00:25:55,416 --> 00:25:57,384
Make the range 2 meters.

287
00:26:44,932 --> 00:26:46,559
Precise control.

288
00:26:49,737 --> 00:26:51,705
It's not Duncan's style.

289
00:26:55,143 --> 00:26:56,508
Nor mine.

290
00:27:02,283 --> 00:27:04,581
That's his mother's influence.

291
00:27:24,672 --> 00:27:26,867
Another member of the Duke's household

292
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:28,499
is Duncan Idaho,

293
00:27:28,676 --> 00:27:31,543
friend and swordmaster to Paul Atreides.

294
00:27:31,813 --> 00:27:32,802
Duncan!

295
00:27:34,448 --> 00:27:37,940
Paul, I was just on my
way to say goodbye to you.

296
00:27:39,153 --> 00:27:41,246
I have to go on ahead, alone,

297
00:27:41,322 --> 00:27:42,789
I won't be seeing you for a while.

298
00:27:42,857 --> 00:27:45,155
I wish you were coming with us. Why?

299
00:27:45,226 --> 00:27:46,853
Something for your father.

300
00:27:46,994 --> 00:27:48,621
He wants to talk to you.

301
00:27:49,397 --> 00:27:51,490
I'll see you on Arrakis.

302
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:55,726
May the hand of God be with you.

303
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,338
May the hand of God
be with us all, Duncan.

304
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,804
Father.

305
00:28:37,078 --> 00:28:39,069
Thank you for joining me, Paul.

306
00:28:39,914 --> 00:28:42,542
It will be good to get to our new home

307
00:28:42,984 --> 00:28:45,384
and have all this upset behind us.

308
00:28:48,956 --> 00:28:52,392
Thufir Hawat has served House
Atreides three generations.

309
00:28:53,694 --> 00:28:56,822
He swears you are the finest
student he has ever taught.

310
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:01,564
Yueh, Gurney, and Duncan say the same.

311
00:29:04,238 --> 00:29:05,899
Makes me feel very proud.

312
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,701
I want you to be proud of me.

313
00:29:20,521 --> 00:29:22,148
I'll miss the sea.

314
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:27,350
But a person needs new experiences.

315
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:31,056
They jar something deep inside,

316
00:29:32,133 --> 00:29:34,260
allowing him to grow.

317
00:29:35,903 --> 00:29:37,393
Without change,

318
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,731
something sleeps inside us

319
00:29:44,445 --> 00:29:46,675
and seldom awakens.

320
00:29:50,918 --> 00:29:53,148
The sleeper must awaken.

321
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:21,208
Arrakis, Dune...

322
00:30:21,883 --> 00:30:23,748
desert planet.

323
00:30:27,856 --> 00:30:29,483
I will kill you.

324
00:30:31,226 --> 00:30:33,251
The second moon.

325
00:30:41,937 --> 00:30:43,996
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

326
00:31:31,453 --> 00:31:33,216
Jessica, you were told to bear

327
00:31:33,288 --> 00:31:34,983
only daughters to the Atreides.

328
00:31:35,724 --> 00:31:36,816
Jessica!

329
00:31:36,892 --> 00:31:38,621
It meant so much to him.

330
00:31:39,161 --> 00:31:42,722
You thought only of a
Duke's desire for a son?

331
00:31:43,465 --> 00:31:45,365
Desires don't come into this.

332
00:31:45,567 --> 00:31:48,001
An Atreides daughter could have been wed

333
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,800
to a Harkonnen heir
and sealed the breach.

334
00:31:51,573 --> 00:31:54,872
We may lose both bloodlines now.

335
00:31:56,378 --> 00:31:59,279
I vowed never to regret my decision.

336
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:04,249
I'll pay for all my own mistakes.

337
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:06,753
And your son will pay with you.

338
00:32:16,164 --> 00:32:17,597
Is Arrakis...

339
00:32:18,867 --> 00:32:21,358
Is it really so terrible on Arrakis?

340
00:32:23,138 --> 00:32:24,298
My Duke...

341
00:32:24,372 --> 00:32:26,033
You entered into this

342
00:32:26,108 --> 00:32:29,600
with full knowledge of the
delicate edge you walked.

343
00:32:32,981 --> 00:32:33,970
Jessica.

344
00:32:35,256 --> 00:32:36,275
Girl.

345
00:32:38,854 --> 00:32:41,414
I wish I could stand in your place

346
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,390
and take your sufferings.

347
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:48,218
But we must each of
us take our own path.

348
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,288
I know.

349
00:32:54,936 --> 00:32:56,836
I understand.

350
00:32:57,139 --> 00:32:58,770
About Paul...

351
00:32:59,341 --> 00:33:02,799
What you did and why
you did it, we both know.

352
00:33:03,778 --> 00:33:06,713
But kindness forces me to tell you

353
00:33:06,781 --> 00:33:10,273
there is little chance you will
be the Bene Gesserit totality.

354
00:33:10,418 --> 00:33:14,548
However, I will observe him.

355
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:16,816
In a few minutes, Jessica,

356
00:33:16,892 --> 00:33:20,555
your son will be proved
to be a living human being

357
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:23,122
or he will be a dead animal.

358
00:33:26,034 --> 00:33:27,262
He's here.

359
00:33:29,804 --> 00:33:32,534
Arrakis, Dune

360
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:35,533
desert planet.

361
00:33:36,378 --> 00:33:37,709
Moving...

362
00:33:39,247 --> 00:33:40,236
moving...

363
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:04,165
We'll salvage what we can.

364
00:34:04,673 --> 00:34:07,733
But I can tell you, dear God,

365
00:34:07,943 --> 00:34:10,605
for the father, nothing.

366
00:34:13,215 --> 00:34:16,651
Did you really think you could
bear the Kwisatz Haderach?

367
00:34:16,718 --> 00:34:19,152
The Universe's super being?

368
00:34:19,221 --> 00:34:21,815
How dare you!

369
00:34:22,657 --> 00:34:24,784
My greatest student.

370
00:34:25,427 --> 00:34:29,022
And my greatest disappointment.

371
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,866
He's awake. He's listening to us.

372
00:34:36,004 --> 00:34:39,167
Good! Ready yourself,
young Paul Atreides.

373
00:34:39,241 --> 00:34:43,041
I want to see you in your mother's
chambers in one-quarter of an hour.

374
00:34:45,981 --> 00:34:47,209
Paul.

375
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,541
This is very important.

376
00:34:56,191 --> 00:34:58,318
Remember you are a duke's son.

377
00:35:14,148 --> 00:35:16,946
This is the Reverend
Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam.

378
00:35:18,753 --> 00:35:21,051
She's going to observe you.

379
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:25,991
Please.

380
00:35:26,127 --> 00:35:27,094
Jessica,

381
00:35:28,296 --> 00:35:29,888
you know it must be done.

382
00:35:30,031 --> 00:35:31,623
Your Reverence.

383
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:33,994
What does she fear?

384
00:35:35,503 --> 00:35:36,629
What about my father?

385
00:35:36,704 --> 00:35:37,796
Paul,

386
00:35:39,173 --> 00:35:42,631
listen to the Reverend Mother
and do what she tells you.

387
00:35:51,419 --> 00:35:53,819
Now, you,

388
00:35:55,656 --> 00:35:57,021
come here.

389
00:35:58,092 --> 00:35:59,855
She's using the Voice.

390
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:02,261
No.

391
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,594
Some strength there.

392
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:06,098
Surprising.

393
00:36:06,801 --> 00:36:08,530
Come here!

394
00:36:08,669 --> 00:36:10,660
Come here...

395
00:36:12,206 --> 00:36:14,970
Come here...

396
00:36:27,722 --> 00:36:29,314
Do you see this?

397
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:34,656
Put your right hand in the box.

398
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,656
What's in the box?

399
00:36:36,798 --> 00:36:37,958
Pain.

400
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:39,360
Stop.

401
00:36:40,802 --> 00:36:43,100
Put your hand in the box.

402
00:36:51,212 --> 00:36:53,510
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar.

403
00:36:53,581 --> 00:36:56,482
Don't pull away or
you'll feel the poison.

404
00:36:57,452 --> 00:36:59,943
A duke's son must know
about many poisons.

405
00:37:00,088 --> 00:37:03,421
This one kills only animals.

406
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:06,752
Are you suggesting the
Duke's son is an animal?

407
00:37:06,828 --> 00:37:07,954
Let us say

408
00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:10,361
I suggest you may be human.

409
00:37:10,998 --> 00:37:12,863
Your awareness may be powerful enough

410
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:14,629
to control your instincts.

411
00:37:14,702 --> 00:37:16,567
Your instinct will be

412
00:37:16,771 --> 00:37:19,035
to remove your hand from the box.

413
00:37:19,607 --> 00:37:21,234
If you do so,

414
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,841
you die.

415
00:37:27,048 --> 00:37:28,811
You will feel

416
00:37:30,618 --> 00:37:32,381
an itching

417
00:37:35,156 --> 00:37:36,282
there.

418
00:37:37,525 --> 00:37:42,428
Now the itching becomes burning.

419
00:37:43,464 --> 00:37:46,922
Heat upon heat upon heat.

420
00:37:47,001 --> 00:37:47,990
It burns.

421
00:37:48,069 --> 00:37:49,764
Silence! Silence!

422
00:37:49,837 --> 00:37:53,170
I must not fear. Fear
is the mind killer.

423
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:54,906
And fear is the little death

424
00:37:54,976 --> 00:37:56,876
that brings total obliteration.

425
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:59,811
I will face my fear. I
will permit it to pass

426
00:37:59,881 --> 00:38:03,044
over me and through me. I must not fear.

427
00:38:03,117 --> 00:38:05,978
You feel the flesh crisping.

428
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,251
Fear is the little death that
brings total obliteration.

429
00:38:09,323 --> 00:38:11,223
I will face my fear.

430
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,293
Flesh dropping off.

431
00:38:13,661 --> 00:38:17,529
Fear is the little death.

432
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:19,990
I must not fear...

433
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:24,003
Fear is the little death. I'm...

434
00:38:25,106 --> 00:38:26,437
The pain!

435
00:38:26,474 --> 00:38:27,905
No! Enough!

436
00:38:31,312 --> 00:38:32,779
Kull Wahad!

437
00:38:34,048 --> 00:38:36,744
No woman child ever withstood that much.

438
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:44,353
Take your hand out of the box
and look at it, young human.

439
00:38:47,228 --> 00:38:48,559
Do it!

440
00:38:55,069 --> 00:38:56,900
Pain by nerve induction.

441
00:38:57,038 --> 00:38:59,029
A human can resist any pain.

442
00:38:59,106 --> 00:39:02,166
Our test is crisis and observation.

443
00:39:02,543 --> 00:39:04,238
I see the truth of it.

444
00:39:04,312 --> 00:39:06,041
Could he be the one?

445
00:39:06,681 --> 00:39:07,670
Maybe.

446
00:39:08,683 --> 00:39:10,981
But will he be ours to control?

447
00:39:14,555 --> 00:39:17,581
You know when people speak the truth?

448
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,091
I know it.

449
00:39:25,482 --> 00:39:27,911
Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.

450
00:39:30,471 --> 00:39:33,770
Your mother wants you to
tell me about your dreams.

451
00:39:35,076 --> 00:39:37,044
I only want to know one thing:

452
00:39:38,012 --> 00:39:39,639
Do they come true?

453
00:39:40,348 --> 00:39:41,872
Not all of them.

454
00:39:43,017 --> 00:39:44,848
I know which ones will.

455
00:39:47,655 --> 00:39:51,989
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.

456
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,052
What is that?

457
00:39:54,195 --> 00:39:57,062
The person who can be
many places at once.

458
00:39:57,131 --> 00:40:00,396
The one who bridges time and space.

459
00:40:02,503 --> 00:40:04,698
He will look where we cannot.

460
00:40:06,234 --> 00:40:09,842
Do you know of the Water of Life?

461
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,811
The bile from the
newborn worms of Arrakis?

462
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,006
I have heard of it.

463
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:15,412
It is very dangerous.

464
00:40:16,317 --> 00:40:19,514
The Bene Gesserit sisterhood
use it to see within.

465
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:22,555
There is a place

466
00:40:24,025 --> 00:40:26,050
terrifying to us,

467
00:40:26,427 --> 00:40:27,724
to women.

468
00:40:28,663 --> 00:40:29,891
It is said

469
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:33,165
a man will come.

470
00:40:34,335 --> 00:40:35,859
The Kwisatz Haderach.

471
00:40:37,538 --> 00:40:39,529
He will go where we cannot.

472
00:40:42,243 --> 00:40:43,972
Many men have tried.

473
00:40:44,912 --> 00:40:46,777
They tried and failed?

474
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:49,049
They tried and died.

475
00:40:50,418 --> 00:40:51,908
Jessica.

476
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,130
I sense your teachings in him.

477
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:11,231
Ignore the regular order of training.

478
00:41:11,372 --> 00:41:13,533
His safety requires the Voice.

479
00:41:14,275 --> 00:41:15,867
I've heard enough of my safety.

480
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,602
What about my father?

481
00:41:18,512 --> 00:41:19,774
I heard your talking.

482
00:41:19,847 --> 00:41:21,041
You speak as if he were dead.

483
00:41:21,115 --> 00:41:22,082
Well, he's not!

484
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:23,514
But he's not.

485
00:41:23,584 --> 00:41:26,178
And he won't die. Tell me he won't die.

486
00:41:26,253 --> 00:41:27,845
What can be done has been done.

487
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:29,615
Mother, tell me!

488
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:46,367
The Voice could save you.

489
00:42:03,925 --> 00:42:06,257
The Baron Harkonnen sent Duke Leto

490
00:42:06,328 --> 00:42:07,989
a gesture of peace.

491
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:11,299
No way would the Duke
forego the art of Kanly,

492
00:42:11,366 --> 00:42:12,993
as vendetta was known.

493
00:42:13,568 --> 00:42:15,331
This then, is the Duke's response

494
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,267
as he sat writing at his desk:

495
00:42:17,772 --> 00:42:20,240
"Your offer of a meeting is refused.

496
00:42:20,709 --> 00:42:24,338
"I have ofttimes met your
treachery, and this all men know.

497
00:42:24,879 --> 00:42:28,440
The art of Kanly still has
its admirers in the empire."

498
00:42:28,883 --> 00:42:32,512
Then he signed it "Duke Leto of Arrakis"

499
00:42:32,654 --> 00:42:35,782
knowing full well that
this would annoy the Baron.

500
00:42:37,025 --> 00:42:39,152
With his ducal signet ring,

501
00:42:39,227 --> 00:42:43,061
the Duke put the seal of the House
of Atreides under his signature,

502
00:42:43,198 --> 00:42:45,325
"Duke Leto of Arrakis. "

503
00:42:50,138 --> 00:42:51,230
Vas!

504
00:43:11,963 --> 00:43:13,541
Mentat Piter De Vries.

505
00:43:13,827 --> 00:43:16,078
Message for Mentat Piter De Vries.

506
00:43:16,554 --> 00:43:19,465
The Baron is impatient for Leto's reply.

507
00:43:22,544 --> 00:43:24,820
It is by will alone I
set my mind in motion.

508
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,260
It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,

509
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,620
the lips acquire stains,
the stains become a warning.

510
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,220
It is by will alone I
set my mind in motion.

511
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,660
It is by will alone I
set my mind in motion.

512
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,900
It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,

513
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:42,300
the lips acquire stains,
the stains become a warning.

514
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,620
It is by will alone I
set my mind in motion.

515
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:49,886
My lord.

516
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:51,072
Piter.

517
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,631
The Atreides will be
leaving Caladan soon, Baron,

518
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,020
and I have here your
answer from Duke Leto.

519
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,513
What does Leto say, Piter?

520
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:07,260
He wishes to inform you that "vendetta,"
as he puts it, using the ancient tongue,

521
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:10,260
the art of Kanly, is still alive.

522
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,460
He does not wish to
meet or speak with you.

523
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,820
I've made my peace gesture.

524
00:45:18,303 --> 00:45:21,368
The forms of Kanly have been obeyed!

525
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,740
Bring in Feyd and Rabban.

526
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:53,871
As you instructed me,

527
00:45:53,931 --> 00:45:57,610
I have enlightened your
nephews concerning my plan...

528
00:45:57,643 --> 00:45:59,216
My plan!

529
00:45:59,604 --> 00:46:04,120
The plan...to crush the Atreides.

530
00:46:05,282 --> 00:46:06,571
Feyd.

531
00:46:07,802 --> 00:46:09,291
Rabban.

532
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,628
Go quietly.

533
00:46:14,098 --> 00:46:16,845
No other great house of the Landsraad...

534
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,120
must ever know of the
Emperor's aid to the Baron.

535
00:46:22,066 --> 00:46:25,740
The entire Landsraad would
turn against the Baron...

536
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,280
and the Emperor.

537
00:46:28,656 --> 00:46:30,768
Put the pick in there, Pete,

538
00:46:32,361 --> 00:46:35,010
and turn it 'round real neat.

539
00:46:56,019 --> 00:46:58,994
You are so beautiful, my Baron.

540
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:03,157
Your skin, love to me.

541
00:47:04,231 --> 00:47:07,349
Your diseases, lovingly cared for...

542
00:47:07,643 --> 00:47:10,167
for all eternity.

543
00:47:16,528 --> 00:47:18,440
I will have Arrakis back for myself.

544
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:22,605
He who controls the spice
controls the universe!

545
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:25,129
And what Piter did not tell you...

546
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:28,793
is we have control of
someone who is very close,

547
00:47:28,907 --> 00:47:31,530
very close to Duke Leto.

548
00:47:32,255 --> 00:47:34,256
This person, this traitor,

549
00:47:34,764 --> 00:47:38,529
will be worth more to us
than ten legions of Sardaukar!

550
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:40,831
And who is this traitor?

551
00:47:41,654 --> 00:47:44,091
I won't tell you who the traitor is...

552
00:47:44,126 --> 00:47:45,408
or when we'll attack.

553
00:47:46,731 --> 00:47:50,545
However, the duke will
die before these eyes,

554
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:54,030
and he'll know, he'll know that it is l,

555
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:58,380
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen,
who encompasses his doom!

556
00:49:15,849 --> 00:49:18,671
This is what I'll do to
the duke and his family.

557
00:49:29,454 --> 00:49:32,048
I once told you a
daughter would be conceived

558
00:49:32,123 --> 00:49:33,715
at a time of parting.

559
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,259
I remember.

560
00:49:40,932 --> 00:49:44,595
Conceived in love at a time of parting.

561
00:49:55,546 --> 00:49:57,980
Arrakis is a hostile world, though.

562
00:50:01,152 --> 00:50:03,211
I must be sure you want this.

563
00:50:07,425 --> 00:50:09,325
It has to be tonight,

564
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:14,728
under these influences.

565
00:50:24,342 --> 00:50:28,369
I didn't hear you with the wind.

566
00:50:31,582 --> 00:50:33,680
I whispered yes.

567
00:50:36,954 --> 00:50:38,717
And I whispered:

568
00:50:40,691 --> 00:50:42,522
"I love you."

569
00:52:15,684 --> 00:52:18,113
Soon they will begin to fold space.

570
00:52:19,143 --> 00:52:22,407
Far off in the control
rooms of spice gas.

571
00:52:22,603 --> 00:52:25,870
Traveling without moving.

572
00:54:44,142 --> 00:54:46,042
And now,

573
00:54:46,578 --> 00:54:47,977
the prophecy.

574
00:54:49,581 --> 00:54:51,947
One will come.

575
00:54:53,018 --> 00:54:56,146
The voice from the outer world.

576
00:54:57,055 --> 00:54:59,285
Bringing the Holy War,

577
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:01,592
the Jihad.

578
00:55:02,327 --> 00:55:04,659
Which will cleanse the Universe

579
00:55:04,829 --> 00:55:08,560
and bring us out of darkness.

580
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:10,791
A mother and a son.

581
00:56:16,237 --> 00:56:19,172
House Atreides took control of Arrakis,

582
00:56:19,441 --> 00:56:24,378
63 standard days into the year 10191.

583
00:56:25,747 --> 00:56:27,840
It was known that the Harkonnens,

584
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:30,111
the former rulers of Arrakis

585
00:56:30,185 --> 00:56:33,245
would leave many suicide troops behind.

586
00:56:33,788 --> 00:56:36,279
Atreides' patrols were doubled.

587
00:56:43,357 --> 00:56:45,382
Each trooper will be charged

588
00:56:45,459 --> 00:56:47,427
with responsibility
for preserving water.

589
00:56:47,494 --> 00:56:49,792
Our existence as an
operating army depends

590
00:56:49,863 --> 00:56:52,696
on these following
water-saving procedures.

591
00:56:52,833 --> 00:56:55,495
Remember, water is life.

592
00:56:59,206 --> 00:57:02,471
Why is the shield not yet up?

593
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:06,268
Sir, we found and removed
another sabotage device.

594
00:57:06,647 --> 00:57:08,012
I think it'll go up now, sir.

595
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,987
They're finding these
sabotage devices too easily.

596
00:57:26,967 --> 00:57:29,492
House shield activating.

597
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:12,143
My lady, the local people,

598
00:58:12,379 --> 00:58:15,075
the maids and servants,
await your inspection.

599
00:58:15,249 --> 00:58:17,410
Hawat has cleared them.

600
00:58:20,654 --> 00:58:22,246
Excuse me, my lady.

601
00:58:23,223 --> 00:58:27,353
The Harkonnens may have
tampered with them medically.

602
00:58:36,637 --> 00:58:38,628
When you said Harkonnens,

603
00:58:40,207 --> 00:58:43,005
I didn't know you had so
much reason to hate them.

604
00:58:46,914 --> 00:58:48,347
Well, my wife...

605
00:58:50,451 --> 00:58:53,284
But, of course, you didn't know my wife.

606
00:58:55,522 --> 00:58:56,955
The
Har--

607
00:58:57,091 --> 00:58:58,558
Forgive me.

608
00:58:59,226 --> 00:59:01,160
They must have killed her.

609
00:59:01,729 --> 00:59:04,630
Please excuse me if
I can't talk about it.

610
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:12,164
He's holding something back.

611
00:59:12,473 --> 00:59:16,569
Yet there's the Imperial conditioning.

612
00:59:18,178 --> 00:59:20,237
Assurance of trust.

613
00:59:26,653 --> 00:59:30,384
The Bene Gesserit mother, the legend.

614
00:59:31,325 --> 00:59:32,986
Where is your son?

615
00:59:34,027 --> 00:59:37,519
I must warn you. You
are in great danger.

616
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,741
My message, it's here.

617
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,188
There are more enemy bodies coming in

618
01:00:02,256 --> 01:00:04,656
for your inspection, Doctor Yueh.

619
01:00:09,563 --> 01:00:10,629
Are you all right?

620
01:00:11,394 --> 01:00:12,231
Yes, I'm fine.

621
01:00:13,229 --> 01:00:14,829
Thank you, Thufir.

622
01:01:12,485 --> 01:01:14,119
My Lord.

623
01:01:25,617 --> 01:01:27,039
My Lord?

624
01:01:29,501 --> 01:01:30,675
Thufir.

625
01:01:32,318 --> 01:01:34,411
Haven't you heard from Duncan Idaho yet?

626
01:01:35,197 --> 01:01:36,613
No, Sire.

627
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:40,854
I have, however, discovered
what the city Fremen

628
01:01:40,898 --> 01:01:43,852
called out to Paul when
we entered the city.

629
01:01:46,011 --> 01:01:47,773
Mahdi

630
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:54,348
and...Lisan al-Gaib, yes.

631
01:01:54,619 --> 01:01:56,535
It is a prophecy

632
01:01:56,849 --> 01:01:59,492
that a young leader will come to them

633
01:01:59,897 --> 01:02:02,435
with a Bene Gesserit mother.

634
01:02:03,376 --> 01:02:06,226
It follows the familar messiah pattern.

635
01:02:08,634 --> 01:02:10,828
But Mahdi?

636
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:13,482
Yes.

637
01:02:14,942 --> 01:02:17,318
It seems it is written

638
01:02:18,751 --> 01:02:23,421
that he will lead them to true...

639
01:02:24,738 --> 01:02:26,885
freedom.

640
01:02:37,033 --> 01:02:39,884
One carryall handles
four spice mining teams.

641
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:42,632
However, it will fly only
two harvesters at a time.

642
01:02:42,944 --> 01:02:45,184
Today, we have 930 harvesters

643
01:02:45,382 --> 01:02:47,867
and 981 carryalls.

644
01:03:17,194 --> 01:03:18,550
Safe.

645
01:03:35,259 --> 01:03:37,111
Spice.

646
01:04:08,217 --> 01:04:10,286
The second moon.

647
01:04:12,272 --> 01:04:13,988
The sleeper must awaken.

648
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:32,197
A hunter-seeker!

649
01:04:33,083 --> 01:04:34,822
It can't get me if I don't move.

650
01:04:36,264 --> 01:04:38,190
It's too dark in here
for it to see clearly.

651
01:05:59,901 --> 01:06:01,801
It would have killed me.

652
01:06:02,904 --> 01:06:06,271
I was its target. It went to the motion.

653
01:06:07,142 --> 01:06:08,666
Who are you?

654
01:06:08,743 --> 01:06:10,802
I am the Shadout Mapes,

655
01:06:11,613 --> 01:06:13,444
the housekeeper.

656
01:06:13,982 --> 01:06:17,383
I must cleanse the way between us.

657
01:06:18,053 --> 01:06:19,782
You saved my life,

658
01:06:19,854 --> 01:06:22,220
and we Fremen pay our debts.

659
01:06:23,925 --> 01:06:28,021
It is known to us that you've
a traitor in your midst.

660
01:06:28,463 --> 01:06:30,761
Who it is, we cannot say.

661
01:06:31,032 --> 01:06:33,466
But we are certain of it.

662
01:06:43,912 --> 01:06:44,909
A traitor.

663
01:06:56,524 --> 01:06:59,584
Set up a sonar probe immediately.

664
01:07:04,291 --> 01:07:05,164
Thufir!

665
01:07:07,181 --> 01:07:08,131
did you find anything?

666
01:07:08,998 --> 01:07:10,227
Nothing yet.

667
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:12,101
Keep looking.

668
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:16,583
And the traitor? God help us.

669
01:07:28,797 --> 01:07:30,389
Harkonnen.

670
01:07:33,862 --> 01:07:35,193
My lord...

671
01:07:35,664 --> 01:07:39,623
Again, my lord, I wish
to tender my resignation--

672
01:07:39,701 --> 01:07:41,669
Silence, Thufir. Stop acting the fool.

673
01:07:41,736 --> 01:07:43,499
I told you yesterday.

674
01:07:43,772 --> 01:07:45,205
If you made a mistake,

675
01:07:45,273 --> 01:07:47,468
it was in overestimating the Harkonnens.

676
01:07:47,842 --> 01:07:50,834
Their simple minds came
up with a simple trick.

677
01:07:53,048 --> 01:07:56,211
Paul survived this largely
because of your training.

678
01:07:56,284 --> 01:07:58,013
You didn't fail there.

679
01:07:58,153 --> 01:07:59,453
Sit down, Thufir.

680
01:08:01,112 --> 01:08:02,165
My lord.

681
01:08:09,531 --> 01:08:10,520
Thufir,

682
01:08:12,501 --> 01:08:13,862
there's this traitor.

683
01:08:15,637 --> 01:08:17,305
I know you've cleared everyone,

684
01:08:17,672 --> 01:08:19,533
especially those close to us.

685
01:08:20,408 --> 01:08:22,736
But recheck and find him.

686
01:08:30,754 --> 01:08:34,121
Sector 6 through 80
progress report, Sire.

687
01:08:34,357 --> 01:08:35,824
Take it, Thufir.

688
01:08:39,229 --> 01:08:42,130
Sector 680, copy the 6th, the
summit, the 8th, quadrant over

689
01:08:42,199 --> 01:08:45,396
the 9th plus 84 circles, weave
the 80 and call the 4th. Copy.

690
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:54,237
8. Thufir Tawat, Mentat,
Master of Assassins.

691
01:08:58,215 --> 01:09:00,376
The palace is now secure.

692
01:09:01,618 --> 01:09:04,746
The city of Arrakeen
is under martial law.

693
01:09:05,322 --> 01:09:08,985
We have troops here
headquartered underground

694
01:09:09,092 --> 01:09:11,390
on sub-floors 6 through 10.

695
01:09:11,995 --> 01:09:14,190
The rest of the troops
are stationed in Arrakeen

696
01:09:14,264 --> 01:09:16,391
and we have some on the airfield.

697
01:09:16,466 --> 01:09:18,866
Our new army is still in training,

698
01:09:18,935 --> 01:09:21,631
but everything, everything is shielded.

699
01:09:21,705 --> 01:09:24,833
And with this shielding
we are impenetrable.

700
01:09:27,544 --> 01:09:28,533
Kynes...

701
01:09:29,145 --> 01:09:30,305
Kynes...

702
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,375
Dr. Kynes is waiting.

703
01:09:32,949 --> 01:09:36,214
He is the Emperor's Judge of the Change

704
01:09:36,286 --> 01:09:39,050
monitoring the evacuation
of the Harkonnens

705
01:09:39,122 --> 01:09:41,317
and our taking control.

706
01:09:42,993 --> 01:09:45,757
He plans on taking you

707
01:09:45,829 --> 01:09:49,060
on an inspection of the
spice mining operation.

708
01:09:49,499 --> 01:09:53,560
Now, he may or may not

709
01:09:54,104 --> 01:09:57,767
be sympathetic to our cause. But, Sire,

710
01:09:59,042 --> 01:10:01,533
with the attempt on the young master,

711
01:10:01,611 --> 01:10:05,479
I am against your leaving the palace.

712
01:10:05,782 --> 01:10:07,511
The attempt failed.

713
01:10:07,584 --> 01:10:10,485
Harkonnen captives
have already been taken.

714
01:10:11,121 --> 01:10:13,988
We must crush the Harkonnen
machine on Arrakis.

715
01:10:14,724 --> 01:10:17,352
You all know what to do!

716
01:10:25,168 --> 01:10:29,571
Gurney, we desperately
need more spice miners.

717
01:10:29,739 --> 01:10:32,299
Many are threatening to
leave on the next shuttle.

718
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:35,071
We need spice drivers,
weather scanners, dunemen.

719
01:10:35,145 --> 01:10:37,238
Any with open sand experience.

720
01:10:37,314 --> 01:10:39,908
You must persuade
them to enlist with us.

721
01:10:45,155 --> 01:10:49,285
"They shall come all for violence.

722
01:10:50,126 --> 01:10:53,857
"Their faces shall sup
up as the east wind.

723
01:10:56,232 --> 01:10:59,998
And they will gather the
captivity of the sand."

724
01:11:01,171 --> 01:11:03,002
Very moving, Gurney.

725
01:11:04,808 --> 01:11:06,139
On your way.

726
01:11:11,514 --> 01:11:14,677
And take care of Doctor
Kynes until Paul and I arrive.

727
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:19,311
We will not be prisoners
here in this place.

728
01:11:19,389 --> 01:11:24,224
Behold, as a wild ass in the
desert go I forth to my work.

729
01:11:40,844 --> 01:11:42,106
Yes?

730
01:11:45,415 --> 01:11:47,508
I am the Shadout Mapes.

731
01:11:48,785 --> 01:11:51,345
Your housekeeper, noble-born.

732
01:11:52,389 --> 01:11:54,357
What are your orders?

733
01:11:54,491 --> 01:11:56,482
You may refer to me as "my Lady."

734
01:11:57,861 --> 01:11:59,522
I'm not noble-born.

735
01:12:01,164 --> 01:12:03,860
I'm the bound concubine of Duke Leto,

736
01:12:04,567 --> 01:12:06,728
mother of the heir designate.

737
01:12:07,137 --> 01:12:08,604
"Shadout."

738
01:12:10,206 --> 01:12:12,037
That's an ancient word.

739
01:12:12,675 --> 01:12:15,542
You know the ancient tongues?

740
01:12:15,612 --> 01:12:18,046
I know many things.

741
01:12:19,049 --> 01:12:22,041
I know you came prepared for violence

742
01:12:22,118 --> 01:12:24,780
with a weapon in your bodice.

743
01:12:26,589 --> 01:12:27,954
My lady,

744
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:31,355
the weapon was sent as a gift,

745
01:12:31,494 --> 01:12:33,724
if you should prove to be the one.

746
01:12:33,797 --> 01:12:35,822
And the means of my death

747
01:12:37,667 --> 01:12:39,658
should I prove otherwise?

748
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:48,265
Do you know this, my Lady?

749
01:12:49,236 --> 01:12:50,972
It's a Crysknife.

750
01:12:51,705 --> 01:12:54,218
Say it not lightly.

751
01:12:55,027 --> 01:12:57,449
Do you know its meaning?

752
01:13:02,531 --> 01:13:04,207
It's a Maker.

753
01:13:07,939 --> 01:13:10,303
Did you think I wouldn't know the Maker?

754
01:13:12,131 --> 01:13:13,657
My lady,

755
01:13:15,197 --> 01:13:19,400
when one has lived with
prophecy for so long,

756
01:13:20,135 --> 01:13:24,759
the moment of revelation is a shock.

757
01:13:32,392 --> 01:13:33,599
Mapes!

758
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:37,292
You sheath that blade unblooded.

759
01:13:37,354 --> 01:13:39,585
Yes!

760
01:13:42,682 --> 01:13:48,296
Take the Water of my Life.

761
01:13:58,093 --> 01:14:00,507
You are ours.

762
01:14:00,891 --> 01:14:04,929
You are the one.

763
01:14:32,248 --> 01:14:34,648
So you are Doctor Kynes.

764
01:14:34,718 --> 01:14:36,618
The Judge of the Change.

765
01:14:36,686 --> 01:14:38,950
And the lmperial Ecologist, Sire.

766
01:14:39,022 --> 01:14:40,922
Our intelligence informs us

767
01:14:40,991 --> 01:14:43,619
that there's still a
strong Harkonnen presence.

768
01:14:43,693 --> 01:14:45,923
The process of removal continues.

769
01:14:46,896 --> 01:14:48,488
This is my son, Paul.

770
01:14:50,133 --> 01:14:51,225
Are you a Fremen?

771
01:14:51,301 --> 01:14:52,563
I've been on Arrakis

772
01:14:52,636 --> 01:14:55,764
in the service of the Emperor
long enough for my eyes to change.

773
01:14:55,839 --> 01:14:57,898
In the service of the Emperor...

774
01:14:58,074 --> 01:14:59,871
We are in your hands, Doctor.

775
01:14:59,943 --> 01:15:02,468
Your gift of the stillsuits
is much appreciated.

776
01:15:02,579 --> 01:15:05,446
Would you give us an
explanation of their workings?

777
01:15:05,849 --> 01:15:08,977
Well, this is a stillsuit
of Fremen manufacture,

778
01:15:09,219 --> 01:15:11,278
the most efficient type on Arrakis.

779
01:15:11,354 --> 01:15:12,651
Basically--

780
01:15:16,192 --> 01:15:17,750
It's all right, Gurney.

781
01:15:19,262 --> 01:15:20,456
Yes, Sire.

782
01:15:21,531 --> 01:15:24,830
Basically, it's a
high-efficiency filter

783
01:15:25,301 --> 01:15:27,201
and heat exchange system.

784
01:15:27,771 --> 01:15:30,604
Perspiration passes
through the first layer

785
01:15:30,807 --> 01:15:32,968
and is gathered in the second.

786
01:15:33,043 --> 01:15:34,908
The salt is separated.

787
01:15:35,345 --> 01:15:38,781
Breathing and walking
provide the pumping action.

788
01:15:39,482 --> 01:15:43,043
The reclaimed water
circulates to catch pockets

789
01:15:43,219 --> 01:15:46,120
from which you can
drink through this tube

790
01:15:46,489 --> 01:15:47,854
around your neck.

791
01:15:48,625 --> 01:15:51,685
Urine and feces are
processed in the thigh pads.

792
01:15:52,429 --> 01:15:55,193
Should you be in the open desert,

793
01:15:55,865 --> 01:15:58,231
remember to breathe
in through your mouth

794
01:15:58,368 --> 01:16:00,768
and out through this nose tube.

795
01:16:01,037 --> 01:16:03,528
With a Fremen suit in
good working condition,

796
01:16:03,606 --> 01:16:05,733
life can be sustained for weeks,

797
01:16:06,009 --> 01:16:09,001
even in the deep desert, Sire.

798
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,004
My thanks.

799
01:16:12,515 --> 01:16:14,039
With your permission.

800
01:16:16,553 --> 01:16:18,248
You've worn a stillsuit before.

801
01:16:18,722 --> 01:16:19,711
No.

802
01:16:20,623 --> 01:16:22,454
Your suit is fitted desert fashion.

803
01:16:22,892 --> 01:16:24,457
Who told you how to do that?

804
01:16:25,061 --> 01:16:26,358
No one.

805
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:28,998
It seemed the proper way.

806
01:16:32,202 --> 01:16:33,567
That it is.

807
01:16:33,770 --> 01:16:37,399
He shall know your
ways as if born to them.

808
01:16:39,209 --> 01:16:41,074
We're wasting time, Sire.

809
01:16:57,125 --> 01:16:58,503
Battle language?

810
01:16:59,024 --> 01:17:00,462
Translate it.

811
01:17:03,305 --> 01:17:04,488
Very faint.

812
01:17:09,956 --> 01:17:11,573
Harkonnen.

813
01:17:17,623 --> 01:17:20,599
Air speed, zero-five.

814
01:17:20,644 --> 01:17:23,707
Ambient temperature, 300 degrees Kelvin.

815
01:17:24,615 --> 01:17:26,776
Air speed, three-zero.

816
01:17:31,022 --> 01:17:33,547
Ether bender, 75 percent efficiency.

817
01:17:39,764 --> 01:17:41,197
That's where I told your sandmaster

818
01:17:41,265 --> 01:17:43,165
to concentrate the harvesting today.

819
01:17:43,968 --> 01:17:46,596
Southeast, over the Shield Wall.

820
01:17:48,639 --> 01:17:52,268
Ambient temperature, 350 degrees Kelvin.

821
01:17:53,411 --> 01:17:55,675
Air speed,
one-three-zero.

822
01:17:57,848 --> 01:17:59,839
Caution. You've now cleared

823
01:17:59,917 --> 01:18:02,715
protective Shield Wall
and entered open desert.

824
01:18:12,496 --> 01:18:14,191
Will we see a worm?

825
01:18:14,865 --> 01:18:18,323
Where there is spice and spice
mining, there are always worms.

826
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:19,300
Always?

827
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:20,496
Always.

828
01:18:21,105 --> 01:18:22,766
Why do they come?

829
01:18:23,774 --> 01:18:25,799
To protect their territory.

830
01:18:25,943 --> 01:18:27,968
Vibrations attract them.

831
01:18:29,354 --> 01:18:32,949
Is there a relationship
between the worms and the spice?

832
01:18:34,359 --> 01:18:38,420
As I said, they defend the spice sands.

833
01:18:39,898 --> 01:18:42,765
As to their relationship with the spice,

834
01:18:44,102 --> 01:18:45,296
who knows?

835
01:18:48,673 --> 01:18:50,265
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.

836
01:18:50,342 --> 01:18:52,173
That's it. Spice mining.

837
01:18:53,111 --> 01:18:55,238
No other cloud quite like it.

838
01:18:57,816 --> 01:18:59,681
See the spotters over it?

839
01:18:59,751 --> 01:19:01,343
They're watching for wormsign,

840
01:19:01,419 --> 01:19:03,182
the telltale sand waves.

841
01:19:03,922 --> 01:19:06,823
Seismic probes on the
surface, too, Sire.

842
01:19:08,293 --> 01:19:11,854
Worms can travel too deep
for their waves to show.

843
01:19:13,131 --> 01:19:15,292
Looks like a good patch of spice.

844
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:18,268
Wormsign?

845
01:19:18,803 --> 01:19:20,532
Is it wormsign?

846
01:19:20,605 --> 01:19:22,300
Yes. Worm. Big one.

847
01:19:22,908 --> 01:19:25,274
You've got sharp eyes. May I?

848
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:31,645
Calling Harvester Pad Nine. Wormsign.

849
01:19:32,284 --> 01:19:33,774
Who calls Pad Nine?

850
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:35,046
Don't mention the Duke.

851
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,145
This is an un-coded channel.

852
01:19:37,389 --> 01:19:39,550
Unlisted flight northeast of you.

853
01:19:39,624 --> 01:19:41,819
Wormsign on intercept course.

854
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:44,594
Estimated contact, 15 minutes.

855
01:19:44,996 --> 01:19:47,396
Have sighting confirmed.
Stand by for a fix.

856
01:19:47,465 --> 01:19:50,298
Contact in 16 minutes minus.

857
01:19:50,502 --> 01:19:51,901
Very precise estimate.

858
01:19:51,970 --> 01:19:53,597
Who's on that unlisted flight?

859
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:57,603
What happens now?

860
01:19:57,676 --> 01:20:00,975
The carryall will come and
lift off the spice harvester.

861
01:20:02,547 --> 01:20:04,412
Try to get in close over the harvester.

862
01:20:04,482 --> 01:20:07,042
You'll find this interesting, Sire.

863
01:20:07,352 --> 01:20:09,616
They work until the very last minute.

864
01:20:09,688 --> 01:20:12,248
Spotter control, there's
no sign of the carryall.

865
01:20:12,324 --> 01:20:14,258
It isn't answering.

866
01:20:14,793 --> 01:20:17,227
The worm is eight minutes away, Sire.

867
01:20:17,295 --> 01:20:20,025
Spotter control, give me
a report by the numbers.

868
01:20:20,098 --> 01:20:20,996
Report One.

869
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:22,090
No contact.

870
01:20:22,167 --> 01:20:23,134
Report two.

871
01:20:23,201 --> 01:20:24,225
Negative.

872
01:20:24,302 --> 01:20:25,291
Report three.

873
01:20:25,370 --> 01:20:26,428
Negative, sir.

874
01:20:26,504 --> 01:20:27,493
Report four.

875
01:20:27,572 --> 01:20:30,040
No contact. Repeat, no contact.

876
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:32,433
I think they've got our carryall.

877
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:34,478
Damn it! Harkonnens.

878
01:20:34,946 --> 01:20:37,039
We're coming down to take
you off the harvester.

879
01:20:37,115 --> 01:20:39,174
All spotters are ordered to comply.

880
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:40,512
Ordered by whom?

881
01:20:40,652 --> 01:20:41,914
Duke Leto Atreides.

882
01:20:42,253 --> 01:20:44,244
Yes. Yes, Sire.

883
01:20:44,322 --> 01:20:45,687
How many men do you have?

884
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:47,189
Full crew, 26 men.

885
01:20:47,525 --> 01:20:49,584
But, Sire, we can't
leave all this spice.

886
01:20:49,661 --> 01:20:51,060
Damn the spice!

887
01:20:51,129 --> 01:20:52,460
Get out of there!

888
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:03,869
Two men in each of the spotters!

889
01:21:04,009 --> 01:21:05,772
You, over here!

890
01:21:06,077 --> 01:21:07,066
Run!

891
01:21:07,712 --> 01:21:08,701
Run!

892
01:21:14,986 --> 01:21:17,887
I can't see him yet,
but he is very close now.

893
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:21,153
Damn sloppy. Really damn sloppy.

894
01:21:21,226 --> 01:21:23,091
Come on, boys. Come on.

895
01:21:27,098 --> 01:21:28,998
We're going to be heavy, Sire.

896
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:30,699
Spice.

897
01:21:31,836 --> 01:21:35,033
Pure unrefined spice.

898
01:21:41,279 --> 01:21:43,645
Here he is! We've got to go!

899
01:21:53,425 --> 01:21:55,154
Bless the Maker and his water.

900
01:21:55,293 --> 01:21:57,022
Bless the coming and going of Him.

901
01:21:57,095 --> 01:21:58,960
May His passing cleanse the world.

902
01:21:59,097 --> 01:22:00,997
What's that you're saying?

903
01:22:01,066 --> 01:22:02,260
Nothing.

904
01:22:38,903 --> 01:22:40,666
Gods, what a monster.

905
01:22:49,914 --> 01:22:52,610
Someone is going to
pay for this, I promise.

906
01:22:55,887 --> 01:22:59,084
He's more concerned over
his men than the spice.

907
01:22:59,424 --> 01:23:03,360
I must admit, against
all better judgment,

908
01:23:04,129 --> 01:23:05,790
I like this Duke.

909
01:23:22,437 --> 01:23:23,631
Duncan!

910
01:23:27,008 --> 01:23:31,035
The Fremen have sent
a message to you, Sire.

911
01:23:37,719 --> 01:23:38,947
Have you read this?

912
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:41,511
No, I was instructed it was for you.

913
01:23:42,256 --> 01:23:43,689
It says:

914
01:23:44,158 --> 01:23:46,319
"A column of smoke by day,

915
01:23:47,395 --> 01:23:49,454
a pillar of fire by night."

916
01:23:51,165 --> 01:23:52,496
A warning.

917
01:23:53,101 --> 01:23:54,898
An obscure one, at best.

918
01:23:57,672 --> 01:24:00,300
What have you discovered
about the Fremen, Duncan?

919
01:24:00,774 --> 01:24:01,763
Tell me.

920
01:24:02,910 --> 01:24:04,502
Why haven't we heard from you?

921
01:24:04,579 --> 01:24:07,343
My lord, I suspect so much.

922
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:11,481
I think they are the allies we seek.

923
01:24:11,619 --> 01:24:13,450
They are strong, fierce.

924
01:24:13,788 --> 01:24:16,586
They do not give their
loyalty easily or quickly.

925
01:24:16,924 --> 01:24:18,255
As you know,

926
01:24:18,326 --> 01:24:21,625
the lmperium has never been able
to take a census of the Fremen.

927
01:24:21,696 --> 01:24:23,789
Everyone thinks that there are but few

928
01:24:23,865 --> 01:24:25,924
wandering here and there in the desert.

929
01:24:26,367 --> 01:24:27,698
My lord,

930
01:24:28,469 --> 01:24:31,734
I suspect an incredible secret
has been kept on this planet.

931
01:24:32,173 --> 01:24:35,404
That the Fremen exist in vast numbers.

932
01:24:36,577 --> 01:24:37,737
Vast.

933
01:24:38,579 --> 01:24:42,538
And it is they who control Arrakis.

934
01:25:25,319 --> 01:25:27,014
Dr. Kynes,

935
01:25:27,988 --> 01:25:30,855
being in the employ of
the Emperor, as you are,

936
01:25:31,792 --> 01:25:34,955
perhaps it isn't wise
for you to associate

937
01:25:35,029 --> 01:25:36,587
too closely with us Atreides.

938
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:39,394
On the contrary,

939
01:25:40,668 --> 01:25:42,795
I feel very comfortable here.

940
01:25:46,173 --> 01:25:48,539
Remember how precious water is here.

941
01:25:48,609 --> 01:25:50,702
It was a token of respect.

942
01:25:54,081 --> 01:25:55,844
Are you enlisting with us?

943
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:58,885
You see through to the
truth of the thing, Sire.

944
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:00,978
That means a dual alliance.

945
01:26:01,121 --> 01:26:02,679
He's in with the Emperor.

946
01:26:02,957 --> 01:26:06,620
A dual alliance, yes.

947
01:26:07,394 --> 01:26:09,419
But not with the Emperor.

948
01:26:10,030 --> 01:26:11,361
The Fremen.

949
01:26:16,937 --> 01:26:19,371
Then let water be a bond between us.

950
01:27:11,610 --> 01:27:14,238
Sorry you have to sleep
so far underground,

951
01:27:16,048 --> 01:27:18,346
but we can't take any chances.

952
01:27:20,352 --> 01:27:22,183
I see you're studying.

953
01:27:22,822 --> 01:27:24,449
Knowledge is strength.

954
01:27:26,058 --> 01:27:28,925
Yes, so says Thufir Hawat.

955
01:27:29,728 --> 01:27:31,218
One must have more than that

956
01:27:31,297 --> 01:27:34,027
to hold Arrakis against
our many enemies.

957
01:27:36,502 --> 01:27:38,060
Much more.

958
01:27:40,506 --> 01:27:41,495
Much...

959
01:27:42,942 --> 01:27:43,931
more.

960
01:27:54,086 --> 01:27:55,075
Paul,

961
01:28:01,594 --> 01:28:03,789
if anything should happen to me...

962
01:28:03,863 --> 01:28:06,991
Father, nothing's going to happen.

963
01:28:07,333 --> 01:28:08,425
Yes.

964
01:28:09,668 --> 01:28:12,535
But if it
should, l--

965
01:28:12,972 --> 01:28:14,132
Yes?

966
01:28:14,206 --> 01:28:16,174
Unknown objects on screen.

967
01:28:16,308 --> 01:28:18,276
We are attempting to identify.

968
01:28:24,817 --> 01:28:26,307
I'll be back, son.

969
01:29:25,033 --> 01:29:27,331
Sleep well, my son.

970
01:29:40,148 --> 01:29:41,445
Father...

971
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:43,915
drugged...

972
01:29:50,325 --> 01:29:52,850
Jessica, what is wrong?

973
01:29:53,495 --> 01:29:55,793
Forgive me, my beloved concubine.

974
01:29:57,098 --> 01:29:58,895
I should have married you.

975
01:29:59,801 --> 01:30:02,395
Why hold a dream to ascend to the throne

976
01:30:02,470 --> 01:30:04,665
through a political marriage?

977
01:30:06,341 --> 01:30:08,309
I should have married you.

978
01:30:33,706 --> 01:30:34,859
What happened?

979
01:30:56,858 --> 01:30:57,951
Yueh!

980
01:30:58,426 --> 01:31:00,417
He sabotaged the house generators.

981
01:31:00,995 --> 01:31:02,065
We are wide open!

982
01:31:06,130 --> 01:31:08,564
House shield deactivating.

983
01:31:09,533 --> 01:31:12,593
I've destroyed the new
army's weirding modules.

984
01:31:12,903 --> 01:31:15,064
I've brought House Atreides down.

985
01:31:15,139 --> 01:31:16,401
Why?

986
01:31:16,474 --> 01:31:18,271
I wish to kill a man.

987
01:31:18,943 --> 01:31:20,808
Not you, my dear duke.

988
01:31:21,045 --> 01:31:22,945
You were already dead.

989
01:31:23,013 --> 01:31:25,846
But you'll get close to
the Baron before you die.

990
01:31:25,916 --> 01:31:29,147
You'll be tied and drugged,
but you can still attack.

991
01:31:29,687 --> 01:31:31,678
You can still attack!

992
01:31:32,723 --> 01:31:34,588
When you see the Baron,

993
01:31:34,992 --> 01:31:37,654
you'll have a new poison gas tooth.

994
01:31:39,196 --> 01:31:42,324
He'll want you close,
so he can gloat over you.

995
01:31:43,667 --> 01:31:47,865
One bite on this tooth
and a strong exhale...

996
01:31:49,273 --> 01:31:50,365
Refuse.

997
01:31:50,441 --> 01:31:51,601
No! You mustn't!

998
01:31:52,343 --> 01:31:56,871
Because, in return, I'll save the
lives of your Paul and Jessica.

999
01:32:02,653 --> 01:32:04,120
For Paul.

1000
01:32:19,236 --> 01:32:22,228
When you see the Baron,
remember the tooth.

1001
01:32:22,907 --> 01:32:24,374
The tooth!

1002
01:32:25,142 --> 01:32:26,404
The tooth!

1003
01:32:31,314 --> 01:32:33,714
Attention! Attention!

1004
01:32:33,783 --> 01:32:35,683
We are approaching target area.

1005
01:32:35,752 --> 01:32:37,583
We are approaching target area.

1006
01:32:37,654 --> 01:32:39,417
The bomb scopes are set.

1007
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:42,823
The shield is down! The shield is down!

1008
01:32:45,095 --> 01:32:46,653
Open the doors!

1009
01:32:48,365 --> 01:32:49,559
Signals!

1010
01:32:51,902 --> 01:32:53,301
Get that shield up!

1011
01:32:53,436 --> 01:32:54,869
The shield!

1012
01:33:15,344 --> 01:33:18,359
The weirding modules...destroyed!

1013
01:33:20,804 --> 01:33:21,650
Man the planes.

1014
01:33:22,362 --> 01:33:23,380
Man the planes.

1015
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:30,995
Release the bombs, release the bombs.

1016
01:34:01,552 --> 01:34:05,540
Long live Duke Leto!

1017
01:34:57,719 --> 01:35:00,085
The drug was timed.

1018
01:35:02,124 --> 01:35:05,787
Dr. Yueh has been very valuable to us.

1019
01:35:08,430 --> 01:35:11,524
What a pity you must remain gagged.

1020
01:35:12,768 --> 01:35:14,963
We can't let ourselves be swayed

1021
01:35:15,103 --> 01:35:17,298
by your witch's voice, now, can we?

1022
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:20,902
Leto, where are you?

1023
01:35:22,644 --> 01:35:24,077
Bring him here!

1024
01:35:29,351 --> 01:35:31,319
You've done a very good job.

1025
01:35:31,954 --> 01:35:33,751
He hardly feels a thing.

1026
01:36:10,759 --> 01:36:12,317
Open your mouth.

1027
01:36:13,795 --> 01:36:16,025
Open it! Open it!

1028
01:36:20,869 --> 01:36:23,736
You've done a good job, traitor.

1029
01:36:34,116 --> 01:36:36,641
They are alike, this mother and son.

1030
01:36:37,085 --> 01:36:38,074
Paul.

1031
01:36:40,255 --> 01:36:41,688
Dangerous.

1032
01:36:46,295 --> 01:36:48,729
The training they have had...

1033
01:36:49,364 --> 01:36:51,958
beyond most people's imaginations.

1034
01:36:55,704 --> 01:36:56,693
Leto.

1035
01:36:57,272 --> 01:36:59,536
I leave them in your hands, Piter.

1036
01:37:17,448 --> 01:37:19,143
Goodbye, Jessica.

1037
01:37:20,218 --> 01:37:22,243
And goodbye to your sweet son.

1038
01:37:23,654 --> 01:37:26,121
I want to spit once on your head.

1039
01:37:26,501 --> 01:37:29,163
Just some spittle in your face.

1040
01:37:32,889 --> 01:37:34,591
What a luxury.

1041
01:37:39,425 --> 01:37:41,916
We were ordered to
kill them. So kill them!

1042
01:37:58,043 --> 01:38:00,234
What are your orders, Piter?

1043
01:38:00,613 --> 01:38:03,741
Take them to the desert,
as the traitor suggested.

1044
01:38:04,683 --> 01:38:06,708
The worms will destroy the evidence.

1045
01:38:07,319 --> 01:38:09,583
Their bodies must never be found.

1046
01:38:40,252 --> 01:38:42,686
I knew Yueh's wife.

1047
01:38:44,690 --> 01:38:48,717
I was the one who broke
his lmperial conditioning.

1048
01:38:53,331 --> 01:38:55,856
I've thought of many pleasures with you.

1049
01:38:58,003 --> 01:39:00,563
It is perhaps better that you die

1050
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:02,937
in the innards of a worm.

1051
01:39:03,275 --> 01:39:06,005
Desire clouds my reason.

1052
01:39:07,345 --> 01:39:08,972
That is not good.

1053
01:39:09,915 --> 01:39:11,280
That is bad.

1054
01:40:06,138 --> 01:40:07,730
They're down on this floor somewhere.

1055
01:40:07,806 --> 01:40:09,205
Down there.

1056
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,032
Duncan!

1057
01:40:46,845 --> 01:40:50,008
Back! Keep him back from me!

1058
01:41:00,258 --> 01:41:02,556
You wish now to join your wife?

1059
01:41:02,861 --> 01:41:04,488
Is that it, traitor?

1060
01:41:05,330 --> 01:41:06,627
She lives?

1061
01:41:07,065 --> 01:41:08,965
You wish to join her?

1062
01:41:12,437 --> 01:41:13,699
Join her.

1063
01:41:22,147 --> 01:41:24,411
You think you've defeated me?

1064
01:41:27,385 --> 01:41:31,845
You think I don't know what
I've gained for my wife?

1065
01:41:39,097 --> 01:41:40,655
Take him away.

1066
01:41:42,565 --> 01:41:43,625
Guards!

1067
01:42:04,923 --> 01:42:06,151
Where are they?

1068
01:42:06,258 --> 01:42:07,816
They're over the great desert.

1069
01:42:07,893 --> 01:42:09,918
Continue reconnaissance.

1070
01:42:34,052 --> 01:42:35,644
Yueh's sign.

1071
01:42:39,291 --> 01:42:41,122
He's left us stillsuits.

1072
01:42:49,567 --> 01:42:51,694
Don't touch my mother!

1073
01:42:51,770 --> 01:42:53,533
He's trying the Voice.

1074
01:42:53,905 --> 01:42:55,998
The Reverend Mother
said it could save him.

1075
01:42:56,074 --> 01:42:58,804
Did you hear a noise
from the little one, huh?

1076
01:42:59,477 --> 01:43:02,002
I didn't hear anything.

1077
01:43:05,350 --> 01:43:06,908
The little one.

1078
01:43:20,602 --> 01:43:21,830
Remove her gag.

1079
01:43:21,903 --> 01:43:23,063
Excellent!

1080
01:43:24,706 --> 01:43:28,574
Remove

1081
01:43:28,643 --> 01:43:31,510
her gag.

1082
01:43:40,589 --> 01:43:43,319
There's no need to fight over me.

1083
01:43:44,059 --> 01:43:48,928
...to fight over me.

1084
01:43:54,135 --> 01:43:55,625
A poisoned blade.

1085
01:44:04,112 --> 01:44:09,049
First cut my son's bonds.

1086
01:44:10,218 --> 01:44:14,917
...my son's bonds.

1087
01:44:17,692 --> 01:44:19,125
That's it.

1088
01:44:19,227 --> 01:44:21,889
That's it.

1089
01:44:32,007 --> 01:44:33,372
Oh, my God!

1090
01:45:01,706 --> 01:45:04,504
Duke Leto Atreides.

1091
01:45:31,302 --> 01:45:34,430
Someone's torn the
insignia off your uniform.

1092
01:45:36,207 --> 01:45:37,504
That's careless.

1093
01:45:37,641 --> 01:45:38,972
It was Feyd.

1094
01:45:42,279 --> 01:45:43,541
It was Feyd?

1095
01:45:53,024 --> 01:45:56,482
Duke Leto Atreides.

1096
01:46:00,131 --> 01:46:03,066
Where is the ducal signet ring?

1097
01:46:04,435 --> 01:46:07,029
I must have his ring.

1098
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:10,437
The ring!

1099
01:46:14,045 --> 01:46:17,276
He was brought to us
as is, my lord Baron.

1100
01:46:19,283 --> 01:46:21,911
You killed the doctor
too soon, you fool!

1101
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:26,521
The doctor, Yueh, what did he say?

1102
01:46:27,358 --> 01:46:29,349
Paul and Jessica safe.

1103
01:46:29,927 --> 01:46:32,020
Yes. The tooth!

1104
01:46:32,997 --> 01:46:34,430
He's coming around, Baron.

1105
01:46:34,498 --> 01:46:35,897
Where's your ring?

1106
01:46:37,034 --> 01:46:38,023
Huh?

1107
01:46:39,270 --> 01:46:40,567
You do not answer?

1108
01:46:40,638 --> 01:46:42,606
Wait! Wait!

1109
01:46:43,474 --> 01:46:45,704
You must come closer.

1110
01:46:46,744 --> 01:46:50,043
The water of my life

1111
01:46:52,683 --> 01:46:53,877
for Paul.

1112
01:46:54,351 --> 01:46:57,650
He's crying. He's crying!

1113
01:46:58,689 --> 01:47:00,623
What does that mean, Piter?

1114
01:47:03,394 --> 01:47:05,692
Come closer, Baron.

1115
01:47:14,672 --> 01:47:16,071
Jessica!

1116
01:47:16,507 --> 01:47:17,565
Paul!

1117
01:47:17,875 --> 01:47:19,274
Leto!

1118
01:47:20,478 --> 01:47:22,343
Leto, he's dead!

1119
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:24,580
Oh, he's dead!

1120
01:47:25,950 --> 01:47:26,939
I know.

1121
01:47:34,592 --> 01:47:36,287
Am I alive?

1122
01:47:38,496 --> 01:47:39,520
I'm alive?

1123
01:47:39,597 --> 01:47:40,586
Yes,

1124
01:47:41,966 --> 01:47:43,957
you're alive, my Baron.

1125
01:47:44,735 --> 01:47:46,532
I'm alive, eh?

1126
01:47:47,104 --> 01:47:48,935
I'm alive!

1127
01:47:49,707 --> 01:47:52,676
I'm alive! I'm alive!

1128
01:48:01,291 --> 01:48:03,521
I can't maintain any altitude.

1129
01:48:03,927 --> 01:48:06,395
We'll never reach the safety of rock.

1130
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:12,400
Maybe that small rock.

1131
01:48:12,936 --> 01:48:14,699
Where are we, do you think?

1132
01:48:14,838 --> 01:48:16,601
The south polar regions.

1133
01:48:17,073 --> 01:48:20,509
The forbidden area. Hold on.

1134
01:48:29,686 --> 01:48:31,244
Hurry!

1135
01:48:33,690 --> 01:48:35,590
Take the stillsuits!

1136
01:48:37,327 --> 01:48:38,624
Hurry!

1137
01:48:38,695 --> 01:48:40,663
This crash might bring a worm.

1138
01:48:45,935 --> 01:48:47,197
The signet.

1139
01:48:47,270 --> 01:48:50,000
A million deaths are
not enough for Yueh!

1140
01:49:13,929 --> 01:49:15,897
Where are my feelings?

1141
01:49:15,964 --> 01:49:17,795
I feel for no one.

1142
01:49:22,204 --> 01:49:24,035
The second moon.

1143
01:49:38,955 --> 01:49:42,152
I mean Paul Atreides.

1144
01:49:42,592 --> 01:49:45,060
We want him killed.

1145
01:49:55,910 --> 01:49:59,607
He who controls the spice,
controls the Universe!

1146
01:50:07,488 --> 01:50:10,082
This moon holds my future.

1147
01:50:23,338 --> 01:50:26,535
Never one drop of rain on Arrakis.

1148
01:50:30,244 --> 01:50:33,771
The sleeper must awaken.

1149
01:50:42,457 --> 01:50:44,322
They will call me

1150
01:50:44,926 --> 01:50:46,621
Muad'Dib.

1151
01:50:53,801 --> 01:50:56,998
Listen to me. Listen!

1152
01:50:58,006 --> 01:51:00,304
You wanted to know about my dreams.

1153
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:03,810
Well, I've just had a waking dream.

1154
01:51:05,246 --> 01:51:08,044
Do you know why? The spice!

1155
01:51:08,950 --> 01:51:10,850
It's in everything here.

1156
01:51:11,285 --> 01:51:12,885
Calm yourself.

1157
01:51:13,121 --> 01:51:15,089
Like the Truthsayer drug.

1158
01:51:16,891 --> 01:51:18,188
It's a poison.

1159
01:51:19,293 --> 01:51:21,693
You knew the spice would change me.

1160
01:51:22,730 --> 01:51:24,220
But thanks to your teachings,

1161
01:51:24,298 --> 01:51:26,528
it's changing my consciousness.

1162
01:51:26,768 --> 01:51:29,601
I see it! I can see it!

1163
01:51:30,371 --> 01:51:31,895
Is he the one?

1164
01:51:33,408 --> 01:51:35,968
You carry my unborn sister in your womb.

1165
01:51:36,044 --> 01:51:37,341
He knows.

1166
01:51:40,745 --> 01:51:44,536
You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood.

1167
01:51:46,522 --> 01:51:48,686
I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach!

1168
01:51:49,194 --> 01:51:50,684
I'm something different.

1169
01:51:52,071 --> 01:51:53,511
Something unexpected.

1170
01:51:55,469 --> 01:51:57,427
I am so much more.

1171
01:52:00,666 --> 01:52:03,601
You don't begin to know me.

1172
01:52:07,479 --> 01:52:09,003
Father!

1173
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:15,938
Father, I promise,

1174
01:52:16,035 --> 01:52:18,878
one day the sleeper will awaken.

1175
01:52:33,295 --> 01:52:34,426
Father.

1176
01:52:50,448 --> 01:52:51,604
Go now.

1177
01:52:54,563 --> 01:52:58,770
Take him to his desert to die.

1178
01:53:00,290 --> 01:53:01,395
Go.

1179
01:53:33,275 --> 01:53:35,649
Yueh's left the plan
for the weirding modules.

1180
01:53:47,689 --> 01:53:50,021
We have to get to that mountain of rock.

1181
01:53:51,811 --> 01:53:53,819
We have entered the time
when all will turn against us

1182
01:53:53,902 --> 01:53:55,392
and seek our lives.

1183
01:54:11,547 --> 01:54:13,515
It's further than I thought.

1184
01:54:15,117 --> 01:54:16,744
A worm is sure to come.

1185
01:54:19,164 --> 01:54:22,237
I'll plant this thumper.
That should divert it.

1186
01:54:50,468 --> 01:54:51,524
Remember...

1187
01:54:52,425 --> 01:54:55,350
walk without rhythm and
we won't attract the worm.

1188
01:54:55,555 --> 01:54:57,184
It will go to the thumper.

1189
01:54:59,431 --> 01:55:00,859
I'm ready.

1190
01:55:42,652 --> 01:55:43,613
Faster!

1191
01:55:45,829 --> 01:55:47,873
It's deafening!

1192
01:57:05,149 --> 01:57:06,432
The spice!

1193
01:57:08,909 --> 01:57:10,269
Do you smell it?

1194
01:57:10,410 --> 01:57:11,570
Yes!

1195
01:57:18,952 --> 01:57:19,941
Paul!

1196
01:57:36,570 --> 01:57:37,559
Paul!

1197
01:57:48,916 --> 01:57:50,645
A thumper.

1198
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:08,415
What's happened?

1199
01:58:08,753 --> 01:58:11,099
Why did it leave?

1200
01:58:11,587 --> 01:58:14,491
Someone started another thumper.

1201
01:58:17,725 --> 01:58:19,693
We're not alone.

1202
01:58:48,555 --> 01:58:50,318
Man-carved steps.

1203
01:58:50,390 --> 01:58:51,755
Yes.

1204
01:59:06,073 --> 01:59:09,531
Such stealth. I didn't hear them.

1205
01:59:09,676 --> 01:59:13,043
Perhaps these are the ones
the Shadout Mapes told us of.

1206
01:59:13,347 --> 01:59:15,042
I will take the boy-man.

1207
01:59:15,782 --> 01:59:18,148
He shall have sanctuary in my tribe.

1208
01:59:26,660 --> 01:59:27,649
Stop!

1209
01:59:27,794 --> 01:59:31,195
Get back! She has the weirding way.

1210
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:35,099
Great gods!

1211
01:59:35,836 --> 01:59:38,703
If you can do this to
the strongest of us,

1212
01:59:39,072 --> 01:59:42,269
you're worth 10 times
your weight of water.

1213
01:59:45,278 --> 01:59:48,042
As the leader of my
people, I give you my bond.

1214
01:59:49,049 --> 01:59:51,540
Teach us this weirding way,

1215
01:59:52,019 --> 01:59:54,852
and you both shall have sanctuary.

1216
01:59:54,921 --> 01:59:57,856
Your water shall mingle with our water.

1217
01:59:59,559 --> 02:00:02,050
Then I will teach you our way of battle.

1218
02:00:06,199 --> 02:00:09,532
I give you the word
bond of a Bene Gesserit.

1219
02:00:10,070 --> 02:00:11,765
It is the legend.

1220
02:00:17,310 --> 02:00:20,245
I am Chani, daughter of Liet.

1221
02:00:21,748 --> 02:00:24,876
I would not have permitted
you to harm my tribe.

1222
02:00:26,586 --> 02:00:27,876
From my dreams.

1223
02:00:28,822 --> 02:00:30,847
So beautiful.

1224
02:00:31,825 --> 02:00:32,951
Come with me.

1225
02:00:33,026 --> 02:00:35,119
I'll show you an easier way down.

1226
02:00:49,275 --> 02:00:50,936
He surprised me.

1227
02:00:52,211 --> 02:00:53,974
It was an accident.

1228
02:00:54,780 --> 02:00:59,080
Stilgar, I invoke the Amtal Rule.

1229
02:00:59,418 --> 02:01:01,511
Jamis, you force this fight.

1230
02:01:01,687 --> 02:01:04,053
These people have my countenance.

1231
02:01:04,123 --> 02:01:07,456
If you should win, I will cut you down.

1232
02:01:07,526 --> 02:01:09,323
Jamis, I don't want to fight you.

1233
02:01:09,395 --> 02:01:10,453
Maybe if
I explain--

1234
02:01:10,529 --> 02:01:11,621
Explain?

1235
02:01:12,531 --> 02:01:14,362
Explain death.

1236
02:01:14,467 --> 02:01:18,801
I am going to sheath
my knife in your blood.

1237
02:01:20,473 --> 02:01:21,838
No shields.

1238
02:01:22,641 --> 02:01:24,575
I'm used to shield fighting.

1239
02:01:25,411 --> 02:01:26,935
Take my crysknife.

1240
02:01:30,883 --> 02:01:33,818
Jamis turns to the right
with his knife after a parry.

1241
02:01:35,154 --> 02:01:37,281
And watch for a knife switch.

1242
02:01:52,037 --> 02:01:55,029
May thy knife chip and shatter.

1243
02:02:52,968 --> 02:02:56,239
How does it feel to be a killer?

1244
02:03:19,098 --> 02:03:21,397
He gives water to the dead.

1245
02:03:29,393 --> 02:03:32,909
My son has never killed before this day.

1246
02:03:33,190 --> 02:03:34,919
You have strength.

1247
02:03:35,893 --> 02:03:38,054
You shall be known as Usul,

1248
02:03:38,228 --> 02:03:41,026
which is the strength of
the base of the pillar.

1249
02:03:41,598 --> 02:03:43,998
This is your secret name in our troop.

1250
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:47,464
But you must choose the name of manhood,

1251
02:03:47,938 --> 02:03:50,133
which we will call you openly.

1252
02:03:53,177 --> 02:03:56,510
What do you call the mouse
shadow in the second moon?

1253
02:03:59,216 --> 02:04:01,980
We call that one Muad'Dib.

1254
02:04:03,420 --> 02:04:05,786
Could I be known as Paul Muad'Dib?

1255
02:04:06,690 --> 02:04:08,851
You are Paul Muad'Dib.

1256
02:04:10,360 --> 02:04:13,454
And your mother shall
be a Sayyidina among us.

1257
02:04:14,331 --> 02:04:15,958
We welcome you.

1258
02:04:17,468 --> 02:04:20,335
The dream unfolds.

1259
02:04:51,991 --> 02:04:54,459
The wife and sons of Jamis.

1260
02:06:15,708 --> 02:06:18,336
This water belongs to Usul.

1261
02:06:18,778 --> 02:06:21,178
May he guard it for the tribe.

1262
02:06:21,514 --> 02:06:24,449
May he be generous with
it in time of need.

1263
02:06:29,255 --> 02:06:33,316
Jamis carried 33 liters and seven
and three thirty second drachms.

1264
02:06:33,393 --> 02:06:34,985
Do you accept them?

1265
02:06:38,498 --> 02:06:39,487
Yes.

1266
02:06:41,467 --> 02:06:42,900
Water masters.

1267
02:07:08,304 --> 02:07:09,464
Moisture!

1268
02:07:09,606 --> 02:07:10,766
Wind traps.

1269
02:07:11,941 --> 02:07:13,408
Huge ones.

1270
02:07:21,317 --> 02:07:24,218
Water. Millions of decaliters.

1271
02:07:25,255 --> 02:07:26,813
A treasure.

1272
02:07:26,956 --> 02:07:29,049
Greater than treasure, Usul.

1273
02:07:29,959 --> 02:07:32,985
We have thousands of such caches,

1274
02:07:34,531 --> 02:07:37,398
and only a few of us know them all.

1275
02:07:37,967 --> 02:07:40,162
And when we have enough,

1276
02:07:41,037 --> 02:07:43,972
we shall change the face of Arrakis.

1277
02:08:04,227 --> 02:08:06,320
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

1278
02:08:09,432 --> 02:08:11,866
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

1279
02:08:32,789 --> 02:08:34,154
What is it?

1280
02:08:35,592 --> 02:08:38,220
Liet, Chani's father,

1281
02:08:38,294 --> 02:08:41,855
the leader of our people, is dead.

1282
02:08:41,931 --> 02:08:43,694
Killed by the Harkonnen.

1283
02:08:44,734 --> 02:08:47,202
For the father, nothing.

1284
02:08:48,004 --> 02:08:50,370
Both of us have lost our fathers.

1285
02:09:42,058 --> 02:09:44,151
Rabban! Rabban!

1286
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:46,391
Rabban!

1287
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:48,555
We're knee-deep in Atreides blood!

1288
02:09:48,698 --> 02:09:50,757
We've gutted them!

1289
02:09:50,833 --> 02:09:52,528
We've gutted them!

1290
02:09:56,839 --> 02:09:59,535
Rabban! Rabban!

1291
02:10:00,943 --> 02:10:03,844
I place you in charge of Arrakis.

1292
02:10:03,913 --> 02:10:06,814
It's yours to squeeze, as I promised.

1293
02:10:06,883 --> 02:10:11,718
I want you to squeeze
and squeeze and squeeze!

1294
02:10:11,788 --> 02:10:14,655
Give me spice! Drive them!

1295
02:10:14,724 --> 02:10:16,749
Drive them into utter submission!

1296
02:10:16,826 --> 02:10:19,954
Do not show the slightest pity or mercy!

1297
02:10:20,029 --> 02:10:23,157
Never stop! Go! Go!

1298
02:10:23,232 --> 02:10:24,426
Show no mercy!

1299
02:10:24,500 --> 02:10:25,660
Yes, Baron!

1300
02:10:44,987 --> 02:10:45,976
Feyd.

1301
02:10:53,896 --> 02:10:58,390
And when we've crushed
these people enough,

1302
02:10:59,569 --> 02:11:01,400
I'll send you.

1303
02:11:02,271 --> 02:11:03,363
Feyd.

1304
02:11:07,877 --> 02:11:09,435
Lovely Feyd.

1305
02:11:16,219 --> 02:11:18,346
Where's my doctor?

1306
02:11:24,994 --> 02:11:26,291
Jessica,

1307
02:11:28,297 --> 02:11:30,697
our Reverend Mother is too old.

1308
02:11:31,634 --> 02:11:34,194
She has been calling
through space and time

1309
02:11:34,270 --> 02:11:36,431
for you to come and let her rest.

1310
02:11:37,874 --> 02:11:40,638
She asks that you pass within

1311
02:11:41,511 --> 02:11:43,570
and become our Reverend Mother.

1312
02:11:46,173 --> 02:11:48,456
Do you know the Water Of Life?

1313
02:11:51,513 --> 02:11:55,758
Come watch the mystery of mysteries.

1314
02:11:57,157 --> 02:12:00,141
The end, and the beginning.

1315
02:12:54,418 --> 02:12:56,084
The Water Of Life.

1316
02:13:02,773 --> 02:13:05,255
The Water Of Life.

1317
02:13:07,148 --> 02:13:11,312
If you be a Reverend Mother,

1318
02:13:13,554 --> 02:13:17,285
let Shai-Hulud judge now!

1319
02:13:26,767 --> 02:13:29,292
But what of my unborn child?

1320
02:13:50,758 --> 02:13:53,022
Following the Bene Gesserit tradition,

1321
02:13:53,093 --> 02:13:55,323
the old Reverend Mother
surrendered her life

1322
02:13:55,396 --> 02:13:57,591
as she surrendered her knowledge.

1323
02:13:58,332 --> 02:14:02,496
Jessica had successfully transmuted
the poisonous Water of Life.

1324
02:14:03,103 --> 02:14:06,163
Every man who has tried has died.

1325
02:14:10,144 --> 02:14:12,908
The sleeper must awaken.

1326
02:14:20,154 --> 02:14:22,645
The tremendous power
of the Water of Life

1327
02:14:22,923 --> 02:14:26,484
caused the premature birth
of Jessica's daughter, Alia.

1328
02:14:27,461 --> 02:14:29,429
Alia was born with all the knowledge

1329
02:14:29,563 --> 02:14:31,554
and powers of a Reverend Mother.

1330
02:14:41,460 --> 02:14:44,952
Feyd, even though he's aging,

1331
02:14:45,163 --> 02:14:48,462
Thufir is one of the finest
Mentats in the Universe.

1332
02:14:49,401 --> 02:14:53,132
And he's mine, Feyd, all mine.

1333
02:14:56,742 --> 02:14:57,766
Quiet now.

1334
02:14:57,843 --> 02:14:58,810
I will.

1335
02:14:58,877 --> 02:15:00,105
Come.

1336
02:15:13,925 --> 02:15:15,392
Oh, Thufir,

1337
02:15:16,394 --> 02:15:19,227
I see they've installed
your heart plug already.

1338
02:15:20,832 --> 02:15:23,232
Don't be angry. Everyone gets one here.

1339
02:15:24,436 --> 02:15:26,336
But this is not why we're here.

1340
02:15:27,606 --> 02:15:30,131
We've brought you a little cat, Thufir.

1341
02:15:31,643 --> 02:15:34,168
You must care for it
if you wish to live.

1342
02:15:35,347 --> 02:15:39,283
A poison has been introduced
into your body, Thufir Hawat.

1343
02:15:40,118 --> 02:15:43,918
By milking this-- this
smooth, little cat's body,

1344
02:15:43,989 --> 02:15:45,980
you receive your antidote.

1345
02:15:46,124 --> 02:15:48,149
It must be done each day.

1346
02:15:51,296 --> 02:15:55,960
All I can see is an
Atreides that I want to kill.

1347
02:15:57,169 --> 02:16:00,036
Feyd, no. No!

1348
02:16:01,173 --> 02:16:03,471
Thufir's a Harkonnen now.

1349
02:16:04,261 --> 02:16:06,035
Aren't you, Thufir?

1350
02:16:06,578 --> 02:16:10,446
My Duke, how I've failed you.

1351
02:16:27,605 --> 02:16:28,912
Chani, I love you.

1352
02:16:31,631 --> 02:16:33,435
I've always loved you.

1353
02:16:42,081 --> 02:16:47,410
We sense that you may be the
voice from the outer world.

1354
02:16:48,240 --> 02:16:50,699
Both moons told us of you.

1355
02:16:51,616 --> 02:16:55,247
You must pass tests before we will know.

1356
02:16:56,192 --> 02:16:58,622
You must conquer the
beast of the desert,

1357
02:16:59,246 --> 02:17:03,615
both his outer and his
deadly inner powers.

1358
02:17:04,351 --> 02:17:08,185
Speak to us from the outer world.

1359
02:17:16,298 --> 02:17:18,596
The Holy Warriors.

1360
02:17:19,668 --> 02:17:22,136
No one ever dreamed there were so many.

1361
02:17:23,772 --> 02:17:28,106
I am Usul. Paul Muad'Dib.

1362
02:17:32,080 --> 02:17:34,378
Our shared enemy, the Harkonnens,

1363
02:17:34,449 --> 02:17:36,747
are once again in control of Arrakis.

1364
02:17:38,119 --> 02:17:40,246
Stilgar, your leader,

1365
02:17:40,622 --> 02:17:42,089
has asked me and my mother

1366
02:17:42,157 --> 02:17:45,058
to teach you the weirding
way to crush the Harkonnens.

1367
02:17:46,828 --> 02:17:48,728
We must do more than this.

1368
02:17:49,598 --> 02:17:53,329
We must totally destroy all
spice production on Arrakis.

1369
02:17:54,903 --> 02:17:58,498
The Guild and the entire
Universe depends on spice.

1370
02:17:59,941 --> 02:18:02,967
He who can destroy a
thing, controls a thing.

1371
02:18:04,279 --> 02:18:07,077
I will take 100 of your
warriors and train them.

1372
02:18:07,782 --> 02:18:10,478
This 100 will train the
thousands that remain.

1373
02:18:11,519 --> 02:18:13,544
When the spice flow stops,

1374
02:18:14,089 --> 02:18:16,421
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.

1375
02:18:17,325 --> 02:18:19,190
The Baron and the Emperor himself

1376
02:18:19,260 --> 02:18:21,091
will be forced to deal with us.

1377
02:18:24,399 --> 02:18:29,098
Arrakis will become the
center of the Universe.

1378
02:18:31,373 --> 02:18:32,362
Orato!

1379
02:18:36,177 --> 02:18:39,704
This obelisk is of your hardest stone.

1380
02:18:41,850 --> 02:18:42,839
Kick it.

1381
02:18:49,691 --> 02:18:50,680
Hit it.

1382
02:18:56,297 --> 02:18:57,662
Yell at it.

1383
02:19:03,204 --> 02:19:04,466
Break!

1384
02:19:06,841 --> 02:19:09,435
Korba, cut it.

1385
02:19:22,824 --> 02:19:24,189
Move back.

1386
02:19:53,221 --> 02:19:56,452
This is part of the weirding
way that we will teach you.

1387
02:19:59,260 --> 02:20:02,752
Some thoughts have a certain sound

1388
02:20:03,665 --> 02:20:05,929
that being the equivalent to a form.

1389
02:20:06,668 --> 02:20:08,795
Through sound and motion,

1390
02:20:09,204 --> 02:20:13,265
you will be able to paralyze
nerves, shatter bones,

1391
02:20:13,608 --> 02:20:17,874
set fires, suffocate an
enemy, or burst his organs.

1392
02:20:18,480 --> 02:20:22,712
We will kill until no
Harkonnen breathes Arrakeen air.

1393
02:20:22,784 --> 02:20:25,184
Muad'Dib!

1394
02:20:35,764 --> 02:20:36,924
Stilgar.

1395
02:20:39,067 --> 02:20:40,056
Muad'Dib.

1396
02:20:40,135 --> 02:20:41,159
Hmm?

1397
02:20:41,236 --> 02:20:44,399
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

1398
02:20:49,344 --> 02:20:51,744
My name is a killing word.

1399
02:20:51,880 --> 02:20:54,280
They are ready to fight.

1400
02:20:54,516 --> 02:20:56,279
Yet in order to lead them,

1401
02:20:56,351 --> 02:20:59,479
I must conquer the
worm, conquer Shai-Hulud.

1402
02:21:27,115 --> 02:21:30,107
Usul, it is time you become a sand rider

1403
02:21:30,185 --> 02:21:32,153
and travel as a Fremen.

1404
02:21:33,454 --> 02:21:36,184
Take the kiswa maker hook of our sietch

1405
02:21:36,958 --> 02:21:39,188
and ride as a leader of men.

1406
02:21:47,235 --> 02:21:48,793
Two thumpers are planted.

1407
02:21:48,903 --> 02:21:50,837
The worm may not surface for the first.

1408
02:21:50,972 --> 02:21:52,940
He will rise for the second.

1409
02:21:53,308 --> 02:21:54,935
And remember,

1410
02:21:55,710 --> 02:21:58,838
when the worm approaches,
you must be utterly still

1411
02:21:58,913 --> 02:22:00,938
and close enough to plant the hook

1412
02:22:01,049 --> 02:22:03,347
firmly under a ring segment.

1413
02:22:03,718 --> 02:22:06,152
The worm will turn to
lift this exposed area

1414
02:22:06,221 --> 02:22:08,485
as far from the abrasive
sand as possible,

1415
02:22:08,556 --> 02:22:11,525
and it will take you with it to the top.

1416
02:22:13,261 --> 02:22:14,592
Do not get too close.

1417
02:22:14,662 --> 02:22:17,187
As he approaches, the
sand will engulf you.

1418
02:22:21,236 --> 02:22:23,602
Wait till the head of the worm passes,

1419
02:22:23,671 --> 02:22:26,105
then go quickly.

1420
02:22:50,198 --> 02:22:51,995
Shai-Hulud.

1421
02:23:32,774 --> 02:23:36,266
I must not fear. Fear
is the mind killer.

1422
02:23:45,053 --> 02:23:47,817
Only the very strong
ones travel this deep.

1423
02:23:48,489 --> 02:23:51,049
Usul has called a big one!

1424
02:23:51,559 --> 02:23:54,187
Again, it is the legend.

1425
02:24:15,350 --> 02:24:17,477
Muad'Dib!

1426
02:25:53,648 --> 02:25:56,310
Now we are ready for battle.

1427
02:26:06,828 --> 02:26:10,662
Usul, these are 15
of our finest warriors

1428
02:26:10,832 --> 02:26:13,926
to serve you as your guard.

1429
02:26:18,673 --> 02:26:20,106
The Fedaykin.

1430
02:26:38,526 --> 02:26:39,515
Now.

1431
02:27:27,775 --> 02:27:28,764
Muad'Dib.

1432
02:27:40,755 --> 02:27:44,247
When the spice flow stops,
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.

1433
02:27:44,959 --> 02:27:46,859
The Baron and the Emperor himself

1434
02:27:46,994 --> 02:27:48,928
will be forced to deal with us.

1435
02:27:52,633 --> 02:27:55,898
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

1436
02:27:56,003 --> 02:27:57,129
Muad'Dib.

1437
02:27:57,205 --> 02:27:58,331
What happened?

1438
02:27:58,973 --> 02:28:00,702
What happened to you and your men?

1439
02:28:00,775 --> 02:28:01,969
Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!

1440
02:28:02,043 --> 02:28:03,101
What are you saying?

1441
02:28:03,177 --> 02:28:07,113
Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!

1442
02:28:08,983 --> 02:28:11,952
He's been repeating that
name ever since we found him.

1443
02:28:12,587 --> 02:28:16,853
Who is this Muad'Dib?

1444
02:28:19,031 --> 02:28:21,898
In the two standard years that followed,

1445
02:28:21,967 --> 02:28:26,097
Muad'Dib and the Fremen brought
spice production to a standstill.

1446
02:28:27,005 --> 02:28:29,974
Fearing for his life,
Rabban did his best

1447
02:28:30,042 --> 02:28:33,307
to hide this fact from
his uncle, the Baron.

1448
02:28:39,785 --> 02:28:43,221
Paul's sister Alia matured
at a frightening rate.

1449
02:28:43,288 --> 02:28:46,348
Her small body harbored
tremendous powers.

1450
02:28:47,926 --> 02:28:50,554
Paul and Chani's love grew.

1451
02:28:55,801 --> 02:28:57,428
We surprised a band of smugglers.

1452
02:28:57,502 --> 02:28:59,299
Too bad. I thought they were Harkonnen.

1453
02:29:11,850 --> 02:29:13,181
Gurney!

1454
02:29:16,855 --> 02:29:19,619
You've no need of your weapons
with me, Gurney Halleck.

1455
02:29:20,225 --> 02:29:21,214
Paul!

1456
02:29:23,161 --> 02:29:24,185
Paul.

1457
02:29:24,262 --> 02:29:25,923
Don't you trust your own eyes?

1458
02:29:26,064 --> 02:29:27,759
They said you were dead.

1459
02:29:30,602 --> 02:29:31,591
They...

1460
02:29:32,337 --> 02:29:33,326
They said...

1461
02:29:39,010 --> 02:29:39,977
Gurney.

1462
02:29:40,045 --> 02:29:41,034
You young pup.

1463
02:29:41,113 --> 02:29:42,137
Gurney!

1464
02:29:42,214 --> 02:29:43,408
You young pup!

1465
02:30:00,522 --> 02:30:02,649
Emperor Shaddam IV,

1466
02:30:02,724 --> 02:30:06,683
you have one last chance to
take matters into your own hands

1467
02:30:06,761 --> 02:30:10,128
and bring the situation
under control on Arrakis.

1468
02:30:10,198 --> 02:30:11,426
What do you mean one last--

1469
02:30:11,499 --> 02:30:12,693
Do not speak.

1470
02:30:12,767 --> 02:30:16,669
Listen. You do not have
more than this one chance.

1471
02:30:16,938 --> 02:30:19,532
I represent the entire
Guild in this matter.

1472
02:30:20,308 --> 02:30:24,176
Our Navigators warn you that spice
production is in great danger.

1473
02:30:24,246 --> 02:30:26,510
A new Fremen leader, Muad'Dib,

1474
02:30:26,648 --> 02:30:28,912
has stopped spice mining on Arrakis.

1475
02:30:28,984 --> 02:30:32,215
Our Navigators suggest
he is not of Arrakis.

1476
02:30:32,287 --> 02:30:35,188
No one on the outside world
has been able to see him.

1477
02:30:35,257 --> 02:30:37,350
We do not know who he is.

1478
02:30:37,692 --> 02:30:39,785
The Harkonnens cannot stop him.

1479
02:30:40,762 --> 02:30:44,254
Remedy this situation,
restore spice production,

1480
02:30:44,332 --> 02:30:47,324
or you'll live out your
life in a pain amplifier.

1481
02:30:55,477 --> 02:30:56,967
The Emperor will stop him.

1482
02:30:57,045 --> 02:30:58,774
He won't take the Water of Life.

1483
02:31:05,520 --> 02:31:08,956
I want 50 legion of
Sardaukar on Arrakis at once!

1484
02:31:09,324 --> 02:31:10,916
50 legions?

1485
02:31:11,059 --> 02:31:12,686
That's our entire reserves as well.

1486
02:31:12,761 --> 02:31:14,160
This is genocide,

1487
02:31:14,229 --> 02:31:16,424
the deliberate and
systematic destruction

1488
02:31:16,531 --> 02:31:18,658
of all life on Arrakis!

1489
02:31:19,652 --> 02:31:21,343
The Emperor is coming!

1490
02:31:22,065 --> 02:31:23,623
Chani! Chani!

1491
02:31:26,008 --> 02:31:29,569
You were calling my
name. It frightened me.

1492
02:31:30,746 --> 02:31:31,735
Oh, Chani.

1493
02:31:33,248 --> 02:31:35,443
All the images of my future are gone.

1494
02:31:38,253 --> 02:31:40,653
I have to drink the Water of Life.

1495
02:31:40,789 --> 02:31:43,223
No, Paul, please.

1496
02:31:43,592 --> 02:31:45,355
I've seen the men who have tried.

1497
02:31:45,494 --> 02:31:47,257
I've seen how they died.

1498
02:31:47,529 --> 02:31:51,163
I'm dead to everyone unless
I try to become what I may be.

1499
02:31:54,136 --> 02:31:57,162
Only the Water of Life
will free what can save us.

1500
02:31:58,073 --> 02:31:59,062
Paul.

1501
02:32:03,345 --> 02:32:05,279
I must drink the sacred water.

1502
02:32:08,817 --> 02:32:10,409
We must go now.

1503
02:33:05,307 --> 02:33:08,572
Hurry. All I see is darkness.

1504
02:33:09,578 --> 02:33:10,567
Paul.

1505
02:33:13,148 --> 02:33:15,116
I will love you forever.

1506
02:33:15,817 --> 02:33:17,546
You are my life.

1507
02:33:27,662 --> 02:33:29,289
You are my life.

1508
02:33:35,704 --> 02:33:37,729
Many men have tried.

1509
02:33:38,373 --> 02:33:39,898
They tried and failed?

1510
02:33:40,409 --> 02:33:42,104
They tried and died.

1511
02:34:27,895 --> 02:34:30,227
They're not attacking. Why?

1512
02:34:49,241 --> 02:34:50,765
Alia...

1513
02:34:51,959 --> 02:34:53,404
Mother.

1514
02:34:55,207 --> 02:34:56,899
It's Paul.

1515
02:34:59,546 --> 02:35:03,106
He's taken the Water Of Life.

1516
02:35:08,964 --> 02:35:10,297
Paul's voice!

1517
02:35:12,602 --> 02:35:13,629
The Guild,

1518
02:35:16,382 --> 02:35:19,756
they're fighting me
in the mental worlds.

1519
02:35:21,047 --> 02:35:23,377
They're behind everything.

1520
02:35:24,320 --> 02:35:27,361
They fear the one who'll come.

1521
02:35:29,166 --> 02:35:30,737
Who'll know more.

1522
02:35:32,056 --> 02:35:33,391
Who'll see more.

1523
02:35:34,180 --> 02:35:37,838
The Guild is behind everything.

1524
02:35:39,405 --> 02:35:41,253
It's not finished yet.

1525
02:35:42,141 --> 02:35:43,950
I'm not formed.

1526
02:35:48,052 --> 02:35:52,421
There is a place terrifying to us,

1527
02:35:53,191 --> 02:35:54,488
to women.

1528
02:35:54,559 --> 02:35:57,255
This is the place they cannot look.

1529
02:36:04,235 --> 02:36:07,295
Traveling without moving.

1530
02:36:09,207 --> 02:36:11,767
Now I truly control the worm

1531
02:36:12,744 --> 02:36:14,541
and the spice.

1532
02:36:16,080 --> 02:36:20,278
And I have the power to
destroy the spice forever!

1533
02:36:50,481 --> 02:36:51,470
Paul.

1534
02:36:52,750 --> 02:36:53,739
Paul.

1535
02:36:54,952 --> 02:36:55,941
Paul.

1536
02:37:03,561 --> 02:37:04,926
Father!

1537
02:37:08,533 --> 02:37:09,522
Father.

1538
02:37:10,034 --> 02:37:13,003
The sleeper has awakened!

1539
02:37:19,110 --> 02:37:21,305
Muad'Dib.

1540
02:37:21,979 --> 02:37:24,038
Muad'Dib.

1541
02:37:24,615 --> 02:37:27,015
Muad'Dib.

1542
02:37:27,518 --> 02:37:29,076
Muad'Dib.

1543
02:37:30,454 --> 02:37:31,716
Muad'Dib.

1544
02:37:31,789 --> 02:37:32,949
Arrakis,

1545
02:37:34,458 --> 02:37:35,720
Dune,

1546
02:37:37,061 --> 02:37:38,551
desert planet.

1547
02:37:40,164 --> 02:37:42,155
Your time has come.

1548
02:37:43,067 --> 02:37:47,060
A storm is coming. Our storm.

1549
02:37:48,539 --> 02:37:51,804
And when it arrives, it
will shake the Universe.

1550
02:37:54,345 --> 02:37:57,974
Emperor, we come for you!

1551
02:37:59,891 --> 02:38:01,853
We come for you!

1552
02:38:16,550 --> 02:38:19,075
Long live the fighters!

1553
02:38:19,253 --> 02:38:22,518
Long live the fighters!

1554
02:38:52,488 --> 02:38:55,355
Meanwhile, the Baron Harkonnen

1555
02:38:55,524 --> 02:38:58,220
having been alerted
to trouble on Arrakis

1556
02:38:58,327 --> 02:39:01,524
is on route to check
on his nephew Rabban.

1557
02:39:17,279 --> 02:39:19,076
Suspicion confirmed.

1558
02:39:19,214 --> 02:39:21,045
The Emperor's had Rabban seized.

1559
02:40:03,325 --> 02:40:05,190
Stand by the main control room.

1560
02:40:35,257 --> 02:40:38,420
Gurney, when the storm
hits, set off the atomics.

1561
02:40:39,495 --> 02:40:42,259
I want an opening through
the entire shield wall.

1562
02:40:43,999 --> 02:40:46,763
Stilgar, do we have wormsign?

1563
02:40:49,771 --> 02:40:54,071
Usul, we have wormsign the likes
of which even God has never seen.

1564
02:41:50,165 --> 02:41:54,397
Bring in that floating
fat man, the Baron.

1565
02:42:12,921 --> 02:42:14,718
Why have you brought me here?

1566
02:42:14,923 --> 02:42:18,415
Your Highness, there
must be some mistake.

1567
02:42:19,027 --> 02:42:20,961
I never requested your presence.

1568
02:42:21,029 --> 02:42:22,018
Ah.

1569
02:42:22,397 --> 02:42:24,763
But your lack of action demanded it.

1570
02:42:24,833 --> 02:42:27,495
Your dreadful mismanagement,
your bad judgment

1571
02:42:27,569 --> 02:42:30,504
in assigning to Rabban the governorship.

1572
02:42:31,006 --> 02:42:32,439
You've forced me to come here

1573
02:42:32,507 --> 02:42:34,975
and set things straight, personally.

1574
02:42:35,244 --> 02:42:38,702
And why did you not tell me of the
fighting ability of these people?

1575
02:42:38,780 --> 02:42:41,544
We've just flushed out a nest
of them in the open desert

1576
02:42:41,617 --> 02:42:45,815
and the women and children
overpowered some of our Sardaukar.

1577
02:42:45,954 --> 02:42:48,252
We managed only one hostage.

1578
02:42:48,457 --> 02:42:49,947
Bring in the hostage!

1579
02:42:51,093 --> 02:42:52,526
Only one.

1580
02:43:03,305 --> 02:43:06,832
I am a messenger from Muad'Dib.

1581
02:43:07,909 --> 02:43:09,706
Poor Emperor.

1582
02:43:10,212 --> 02:43:14,012
I'm afraid my brother won't
be very pleased with you.

1583
02:43:14,082 --> 02:43:15,515
Silence!

1584
02:43:15,584 --> 02:43:17,279
Kill this child. She's an abomination.

1585
02:43:17,719 --> 02:43:18,743
Kill her.

1586
02:43:19,921 --> 02:43:22,822
Get out of my mind!

1587
02:43:22,891 --> 02:43:25,519
Not until you tell them both

1588
02:43:25,594 --> 02:43:28,358
who I really am.

1589
02:43:28,497 --> 02:43:30,158
...who I really am.

1590
02:43:30,232 --> 02:43:31,494
Alia,

1591
02:43:33,669 --> 02:43:36,934
daughter of Duke Leto the Just

1592
02:43:37,272 --> 02:43:39,968
and the royal Lady Jessica.

1593
02:43:40,842 --> 02:43:42,070
Sister

1594
02:43:42,978 --> 02:43:46,744
of Paul Muad'Dib.

1595
02:43:46,848 --> 02:43:50,750
Paul's sister? Paul is Muad'Dib?

1596
02:44:01,196 --> 02:44:03,528
Alia keeps pace with the storm.

1597
02:44:08,103 --> 02:44:09,065
With the storm,

1598
02:44:09,137 --> 02:44:11,435
their air power will be useless.

1599
02:44:11,673 --> 02:44:14,642
On Arrakis, it's desert power.

1600
02:44:15,110 --> 02:44:16,099
Gurney.

1601
02:44:17,846 --> 02:44:18,904
Now!

1602
02:44:19,047 --> 02:44:20,139
Atomics!

1603
02:45:01,256 --> 02:45:02,814
Our army awaits us.

1604
02:45:04,526 --> 02:45:09,463
My brother is coming
with many Fremen warriors.

1605
02:45:10,932 --> 02:45:12,160
Impossible!

1606
02:45:12,234 --> 02:45:14,099
Not impossible.

1607
02:45:14,236 --> 02:45:17,763
I told you. He is here now.

1608
02:45:24,513 --> 02:45:27,676
Father, today I will avenge your death.

1609
02:45:51,207 --> 02:45:53,520
An impassable storm has descended.

1610
02:45:53,643 --> 02:45:56,737
The Shield Wall has been
penetrated by atomics.

1611
02:45:58,581 --> 02:46:00,242
Release the Sardaukar.

1612
02:46:00,349 --> 02:46:04,513
Baron, give this little
abomination to the storm.

1613
02:46:05,855 --> 02:46:08,449
Wait for my brother, Baron.

1614
02:47:55,707 --> 02:47:57,538
Wait for my brother.

1615
02:48:11,189 --> 02:48:13,419
Muad'Dib!

1616
02:49:08,480 --> 02:49:09,742
Alia, now.

1617
02:49:10,015 --> 02:49:11,710
Come to me, Baron.

1618
02:50:25,716 --> 02:50:27,537
Muad'Dib!

1619
02:51:08,392 --> 02:51:09,989
Feyd Rautha.

1620
02:51:14,420 --> 02:51:17,808
My God. They've taken your mind.

1621
02:51:19,408 --> 02:51:22,512
Gurney, I see Thufir
Hawat among the captives.

1622
02:51:23,725 --> 02:51:25,046
Let him stand free.

1623
02:51:32,655 --> 02:51:33,941
The antidote...

1624
02:51:36,595 --> 02:51:37,570
Thufir.

1625
02:51:40,145 --> 02:51:41,504
Come.

1626
02:51:49,114 --> 02:51:50,668
A knife.

1627
02:51:52,476 --> 02:51:55,081
In payment of many years
service to my family

1628
02:51:55,952 --> 02:51:57,933
you may now ask of me anything you wish.

1629
02:51:58,991 --> 02:52:00,880
Anything at all.

1630
02:52:03,510 --> 02:52:05,466
Do you need my life, old friend?

1631
02:52:07,346 --> 02:52:08,925
It is yours.

1632
02:52:13,929 --> 02:52:15,178
I mean this, Thufir.

1633
02:52:16,415 --> 02:52:19,538
If you are to strike, do it now.

1634
02:52:51,817 --> 02:52:56,490
Three generations of...you.

1635
02:53:11,608 --> 02:53:14,884
Carry this noble Atreides warrior away.

1636
02:53:31,119 --> 02:53:32,679
Do him all honour.

1637
02:53:35,710 --> 02:53:38,144
Emperor Shaddam IV,

1638
02:53:38,212 --> 02:53:40,339
there are Guild Heighliners above us

1639
02:53:40,414 --> 02:53:42,848
containing many Great
Houses of the Landsraad.

1640
02:53:43,084 --> 02:53:44,642
Send them back.

1641
02:53:44,719 --> 02:53:46,448
How dare you
speak to me in--

1642
02:53:46,520 --> 02:53:47,817
Stop your speaking.

1643
02:53:50,558 --> 02:53:52,958
You have some idea of what I could do.

1644
02:53:55,763 --> 02:53:58,630
Don't try your powers on me.

1645
02:53:59,767 --> 02:54:02,201
Try looking into that place
where you dare not look.

1646
02:54:02,269 --> 02:54:03,998
You'll find me there
staring back at you.

1647
02:54:04,071 --> 02:54:05,231
You mustn't speak--

1648
02:54:05,306 --> 02:54:06,398
Silence!

1649
02:54:10,344 --> 02:54:12,175
I remember your gom jabbar.

1650
02:54:13,314 --> 02:54:15,111
Now you'll remember mine.

1651
02:54:15,249 --> 02:54:17,046
I can kill with a word.

1652
02:54:19,386 --> 02:54:21,581
And his word shall carry death eternal

1653
02:54:22,823 --> 02:54:24,757
to those who stand
against the righteous.

1654
02:54:24,825 --> 02:54:26,315
The righteous?

1655
02:54:26,393 --> 02:54:28,657
There is a Harkonnen among you.

1656
02:54:31,132 --> 02:54:35,068
Give the Harkonnen a blade,
and let him stand forth.

1657
02:54:35,136 --> 02:54:38,833
If Feyd wishes, he can meet
you with my blade in his hand.

1658
02:54:38,906 --> 02:54:40,032
I wish it.

1659
02:54:40,107 --> 02:54:42,098
This is a Harkonnen animal.

1660
02:54:42,910 --> 02:54:45,242
Let me. Please, my Lord.

1661
02:54:45,913 --> 02:54:47,437
The Emperor's blade.

1662
02:55:16,345 --> 02:55:18,540
Why prolong the inevitable?

1663
02:55:21,484 --> 02:55:22,883
I will kill you.

1664
02:55:38,668 --> 02:55:40,192
I will kill him!

1665
02:55:47,110 --> 02:55:48,202
Paul.

1666
02:55:49,645 --> 02:55:51,476
I will kill him!

1667
02:56:01,290 --> 02:56:04,919
Who is the little one? A pet, perhaps?

1668
02:56:05,895 --> 02:56:08,728
Will she deserve my special attentions?

1669
02:56:20,343 --> 02:56:23,176
You see your death.

1670
02:56:23,946 --> 02:56:25,971
My blade will finish you.

1671
02:56:28,151 --> 02:56:31,450
I will bend like a reed in the wind.

1672
02:56:46,502 --> 02:56:47,992
Chaaksa!

1673
02:56:55,711 --> 02:56:57,235
Muad'Dib.

1674
02:56:57,511 --> 02:57:00,415
Usul no longer needs
the weirding module.

1675
02:57:04,795 --> 02:57:06,644
Irulan shall be my wife,

1676
02:57:07,359 --> 02:57:09,951
opening the way for an
Atreides to take the throne.

1677
02:57:11,196 --> 02:57:12,445
I sit on the throne!

1678
02:57:12,951 --> 02:57:16,170
You will sit on a throne on Salusa
Secundas, your prison planet.

1679
02:57:17,291 --> 02:57:19,100
Either that or you will die.

1680
02:57:34,041 --> 02:57:37,536
The princess shall have
no more of me than my name.

1681
02:57:38,778 --> 02:57:40,023
No child of mine

1682
02:57:41,053 --> 02:57:44,677
nor touch, nor softness of
glance, nor instant of desire.

1683
02:57:47,945 --> 02:57:50,756
This is my promise to you

1684
02:57:53,244 --> 02:57:54,858
my love.

1685
02:58:03,673 --> 02:58:05,283
Think on it, Chani.

1686
02:58:06,635 --> 02:58:09,042
We who carry the name of concubine,

1687
02:58:10,743 --> 02:58:13,423
history will call us wives.

1688
02:58:13,850 --> 02:58:16,080
Muad'Dib had become the hand of God

1689
02:58:16,152 --> 02:58:18,347
fulfilling the Fremen prophecy.

1690
02:58:18,955 --> 02:58:20,547
Where there was war,

1691
02:58:20,623 --> 02:58:22,853
Muad'Dib would now bring peace.

1692
02:58:23,426 --> 02:58:26,793
Where there was hatred,
Muad'Dib would bring love

1693
02:58:27,463 --> 02:58:30,125
to lead the people to true freedom

1694
02:58:30,300 --> 02:58:32,962
and to change the face of Arrakis.

1695
02:58:38,508 --> 02:58:40,408
We Fremen have a saying.

1696
02:58:41,511 --> 02:58:44,480
God created Arrakis
to train the faithful.

1697
02:58:45,849 --> 02:58:48,716
One cannot go against the word of God.

1698
02:59:46,555 --> 02:59:48,477
And how can this be?

1699
02:59:50,835 --> 02:59:54,257
For he IS the Kwisatz Haderach!
