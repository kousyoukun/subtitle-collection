Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET

2
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:53,094
A beginning is
a very delicate time.

3
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,766
Know then, that
it is the year 10191.

4
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,394
The Known Universe is

5
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,605
ruled by the
Padisha Emperor Shaddam lV,

6
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:06,983
my father.

7
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:11,571
In this time, the most precious
substance in the Universe

8
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,656
is the spice melange.

9
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,993
The spice extends life.

10
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:21,873
The spice expands
consciousness.

11
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,461
The spice is vital
to space travel.

12
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,672
The Spacing Guild
and its navigators,

13
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:33,968
who the spice has
mutated over 4,000 years,

14
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,763
use the orange spice gas,

15
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,349
which gives them
the ability to fold space.

16
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,643
That is,

17
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:47,190
travel to any part of
the Universe without moving.

18
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:51,319
Oh, yes.
l forgot to tell you.

19
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,155
The spice exists

20
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,700
on only one planet
in the entire Universe.

21
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:02,371
A desolate, dry planet
with vast deserts.

22
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,292
Hidden away within the rocks
of these deserts

23
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,878
are a people
known as the Fremen,

24
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,632
who have long held a prophecy,

25
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,550
that a man would come,

26
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:19,555
a messiah, who would
lead them to true freedom.

27
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:24,393
The planet is Arrakis.

28
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,314
Also known as Dune.

29
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,070
A secret report
within the Guild.

30
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:02,074
Four planets have
come to our attention

31
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,745
regarding a plot which could
jeopardize spice production.

32
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,874
Planet Arrakis,
source of the Spice.

33
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:14,045
Planet Caladan,
home of House Atreides.

34
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:18,674
Planet Giedi Prime,
home of House Harkonnen.

35
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:21,177
Planet Kaitain,

36
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,305
home of the Emperor of
the Known Universe.

37
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,268
Send a third-stage
Guild Navigator to Kaitain

38
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:32,271
to demand details
from the Emperor.

39
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,191
The spice must flow.

40
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:22,863
Father?

41
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,865
Lrulan, you must leave.

42
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,099
A third-stage Guild Navigator
will be here within minutes.

43
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,643
We felt his presence.

44
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,229
I shall want telepathy
during his visit

45
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,314
and a report
when we're finished.

46
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,192
I am your Truthsayer, my lord.

47
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,778
He's here, my lord.

48
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,851
The Bene
Gesserit witch must leave.

49
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,479
Leave us.

50
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,815
Yes, my lord.

51
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:52,995
We are alone.

52
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,210
We have just
folded space from Ix.

53
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,711
Yes?

54
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,173
How was your journey?

55
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,592
Many machines on Ix.

56
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,720
New machines.

57
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,139
Oh?

58
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:54,974
Yes.

59
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,018
Better than those on Richese.

60
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,481
You are transparent.

61
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,776
I see many things.

62
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:10,239
I see plans within plans.

63
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:13,909
I see two great houses,

64
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:18,998
House Atreides,
House Harkonnen feuding.

65
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,835
I see you behind it.

66
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,170
Yes.

67
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,423
You must share with us.

68
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,594
The Atreides House is
building a secret army

69
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,512
using a technique
unknown to us.

70
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,973
A technique involving sound.

71
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,351
The Duke is becoming
more popular in the Landsraad.

72
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,395
He could threaten me.

73
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,105
I have ordered House Atreides

74
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,524
to occupy Arrakis
to mine the spice,

75
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:48,777
thus replacing their enemies,
the Harkonnens.

76
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,362
House Atreides will not refuse

77
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,407
because of the tremendous power
they think they will gain.

78
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,159
Then, at an appointed time,

79
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,287
Baron Harkonnen
will return to Arrakis

80
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,040
and launch a sneak attack
on House Atreides.

81
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,708
I have promised the baron

82
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,961
five legions of
my Sardaukar terror troops.

83
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:10,633
So the Harkonnens will
rid you of House Atreides.

84
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,301
Yes.

85
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,929
One small point.

86
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,765
Here it comes.

87
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,268
We, ourselves,
foresee a slight problem

88
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,938
within House Atreides.

89
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:28,150
Paul. Paul Atreides.

90
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:32,238
You mean, of course, Duke
Leto Atreides, his father?

91
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,991
I mean Paul Atreides.

92
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,036
We want him killed.

93
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:43,249
I did not say this.

94
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,210
I am not here.

95
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,003
I understand.

96
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:22,204
Why would they
want the Duke's son killed?

97
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:29,545
We must have
a look at Paul Atreides.

98
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,714
On Caladan.

99
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,315
The powerful
Bene Gesserit sisterhood,

100
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,816
for 90 generations,

101
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,860
has been manipulating
bloodlines

102
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,112
to produce
the Kwisatz Haderach.

103
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,780
A super being.

104
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,491
On Caladan, Jessica,

105
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,993
a member of the sisterhood

106
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,330
and the bound concubine of
Duke Leto Atreides

107
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,374
had been ordered to
bear only daughters.

108
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,626
Because of her love
for the Duke,

109
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:13,213
she disobeyed
and gave birth to a son.

110
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,259
Paul. Paul Atreides.

111
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,146
Here we are now. Caladan.

112
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,149
And 19 light-years beyond.

113
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,860
Beyond Bene Tleilax.

114
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,029
The training
planet of the Mentats,

115
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,655
the human computers.

116
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,784
Know a Mentat
by his red-stained lips.

117
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,453
There, Arrakis.

118
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,871
Spice Mining.

119
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,832
Carryalls lower
the harvester to the sand,

120
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,627
and lift it off to safety
when a worm attacks.

121
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,546
Worms attack
all rhythmic vibrations.

122
00:11:55,924 --> 00:12:00,010
Weather. See storms'.
No Precipitation.

123
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,931
Never one drop
of rain on Arrakis.

124
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:09,478
And the Harkonnens are near.
There.

125
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,022
Giedi Prime
and the Baron Harkonnen.

126
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,732
The enemy.

127
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,860
The Baron Harkonnen
has sworn to destroy House Atreides,

128
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,613
and steal the ducal
signet ring for himself.

129
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,343
I know, Thufir, I'm sitting
with my back to the door.

130
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,640
I heard you, Doctor Yueh,

131
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,767
and Gurney
coming down the hall.

132
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,352
Those sounds

133
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,729
could be imitated!

134
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,650
L'd know the difference.

135
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,945
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.

136
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,075
My father sent you to test me.

137
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,618
Music, then?

138
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,120
No music.

139
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,914
I'm packing this
for the crossing.

140
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,833
Shield practice.

141
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:13,959
Shield practice?

142
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,545
Gurney, we had
practice this morning.

143
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,671
I'm not in the mood.

144
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,381
Not in the mood?

145
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,009
Mood's a thing for
cattle and love play.

146
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,135
Not fighting!

147
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,720
I'm sorry, Gurney.

148
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,889
Not sorry enough.

149
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,359
What's wrong with Gurney?

150
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,903
He's not faking this.

151
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:44,573
Now, guard yourself for true!

152
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,594
Is this what you seek?

153
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,638
Good.

154
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,099
The slow blade
penetrates the shield.

155
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,353
But, uh, look down.

156
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,399
We'd have joined
each other in death.

157
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,362
You did seem finally
to get in the mood.

158
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,455
Would you really
have drawn my blood?

159
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,208
If you'd have fought
one whit below your abilities,

160
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,211
I'd have given you
a good scar to remind you.

161
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,133
Things have been
so serious here lately.

162
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,469
Soon we'll leave for Arrakis.

163
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,972
Arrakis is real.

164
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,475
The Harkonnens are real.

165
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,520
Doctor Yueh.

166
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,982
Do you have any information
on the worms of Arrakis?

167
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,777
I've obtained a filmbook
of a small specimen.

168
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,655
Only 125 meters long.

169
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:08,949
Only?

170
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,076
There have been documented
sightings of worms

171
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,330
as large as 450 meters
in the deep desert.

172
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,334
That's far from where
we'll be in Arrakeen.

173
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,629
The desert belt
and the south polar region

174
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,506
are marked forbidden.

175
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,758
How do the Fremen
survive there?

176
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,969
We don't know much
about the Fremen.

177
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,264
They live in the deep desert,
some of them in the cities.

178
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,600
They have
blue-within-blue eyes.

179
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,310
The eyes.

180
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,228
Yes.

181
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,607
Saturation of the blood
by the spice melange.

182
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,484
Could the spice
affect us in other ways?

183
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,820
Many dangers exist on Arrakis.

184
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:47,904
For one,

185
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,906
the Harkonnens would not have

186
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:53,577
given up their CHOAM Company
contract so easily.

187
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,748
The Harkonnens are
our enemies, yes.

188
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,710
But behind them,
l suspect, is the Emperor.

189
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,297
You'll make a formidable duke.

190
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:11,928
Now, remember,

191
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,849
the first step
in avoiding a trap

192
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,310
is knowing of its existence.

193
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,521
I know, but if it is a trap

194
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:22,814
then why are we going?

195
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,900
We have our new army.

196
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,902
Doctor Yueh,

197
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,780
put the weirding module on him.

198
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,744
Well.

199
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,597
Clear and lock the room!

200
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,974
Detachment, stand down.

201
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,443
Activate a fighter.

202
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,424
Make the range two meters.

203
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,473
Precise control.

204
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,629
Duncan!

205
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:55,550
Paul, l was just on my way
to say goodbye to you.

206
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,845
I have to go on ahead, alone,

207
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,388
l won't be seeing you
for a while.

208
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,766
I wish you were
coming with us. Why?

209
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,559
It's something for your father.

210
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,645
He wants to talk to you.

211
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,731
I'll see you on Arrakis.

212
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,360
May the hand of God
be with you.

213
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,321
May the hand of God
be with us all, Duncan.

214
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,588
Father.

215
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,049
Thank you for joining me, Paul.

216
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:40,136
Thufir Hawat has served House
Atreides three generations.

217
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:45,141
He swears you are the finest
student he has ever taught.

218
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,521
Yueh, Gurney, and Duncan
say the same.

219
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:53,900
Makes me feel very proud.

220
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:56,236
I want you to be proud of me.

221
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,125
I'll miss the sea.

222
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,255
But a person
needs new experiences.

223
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,800
They jar something deep inside

224
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,845
allowing him to grow.

225
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,557
Without change,

226
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:30,228
something sleeps inside us,

227
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,482
and seldom awakens.

228
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,281
The sleeper must awaken.

229
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:09,935
Arrakis, Dune.

230
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,063
Desert Planet.

231
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,526
I will kill you.

232
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,739
The second moon.

233
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,041
Tell me of your
home world, Usul.

234
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,847
l know she
has come to test him.

235
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:51,726
No man has ever been
tested with the box.

236
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,689
Tonight, I may lose my son.

237
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:24,259
Jessica, you were told to bear
only daughters to the Atreides.

238
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,802
Jessica!

239
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,887
It meant so much to him.

240
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,599
You thought only of
a Duke's desire for a son?

241
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,477
Desires don't come into this.

242
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,187
An Atreides daughter

243
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,273
could have been wed
to a Harkonnen heir

244
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,358
and sealed the breach.

245
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,903
We may lose
both bloodlines now.

246
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:48,450
I vowed never to
regret my decision.

247
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,121
I'll pay for
all my own mistakes.

248
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,957
And your son will pay with you.

249
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,086
Arrakis, Dune,

250
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,131
Desert Planet.

251
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,969
Moving.

252
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,826
We'll salvage what we can.

253
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,954
But l can tell you, dear God,

254
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:38,291
for the father, nothing.

255
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,502
For the father, nothing?

256
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:44,214
Did you really think you could
bear the Kwisatz Haderach?

257
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:46,716
The Universe's super being?

258
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,511
How dare you!

259
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,472
My greatest student.

260
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,518
And my greatest disappointment.

261
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,565
He's awake.
He's listening to us.

262
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,694
Good! Ready yourself,
young Paul Atreides.

263
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,613
I want to see you
in your mother's chambers

264
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,365
in one-quarter
of an hour.

265
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:14,786
Paul.

266
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,081
This is very important.

267
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,672
Kwisatz Haderach?
The super being?

268
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,883
For the father, nothing?

269
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,357
Vas.

270
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:03,168
This is the Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam.

271
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:07,088
She's going to observe you.

272
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:11,843
Please.

273
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,219
Jessica,

274
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,055
you know it must be done.

275
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,849
Your Reverence.

276
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,393
What does she fear?

277
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:22,687
What about my father?

278
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,855
Paul,

279
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:28,776
listen to the Reverend Mother
and do what she tells you.

280
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,787
Now, you,

281
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:42,999
come here.

282
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,294
She's using the Voice.

283
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,046
No.

284
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,131
Some strength there.

285
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:51,966
Surprising.

286
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,178
Come here!

287
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,513
Here.

288
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,975
Come here.

289
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,365
Do you see this?

290
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,411
Put your right hand in the box.

291
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,872
What's in the box?

292
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:24,123
Pain.

293
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,416
Stop.

294
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,045
Put your hand in the box.

295
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:37,345
I hold at your neck
the gom jabbar.

296
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,765
This one kills only animals.

297
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,227
Are you suggesting
the Duke's son is an animal?

298
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,855
Let us say, l suggest
you may be human.

299
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:52,110
Your awareness may be powerful
enough to control your instincts.

300
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:53,987
Your instinct will be

301
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:56,447
to remove your hand
from the box.

302
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,533
If you do so,

303
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,202
you die.

304
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:06,124
You will feel

305
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,794
an itching

306
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:13,715
there.

307
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:19,512
Now, the itching
becomes burning.

308
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,142
Heat upon heat upon heat.

309
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,310
It burns.

310
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,145
Silence! Silence!

311
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:30,565
l must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.

312
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,277
Fear is the little death that
brings total obliteration.

313
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,196
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass

314
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:40,283
over me and through me.
l must not fear.

315
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,826
You feel the flesh crisping.

316
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,286
Fear is the mind killer.

317
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,706
Fear is the little death that
brings total obliteration.

318
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,832
I will face my fear.

319
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,501
Flesh dropping off.

320
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:55,214
Fear is the little death.

321
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:57,133
I must not fear.

322
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:01,346
Fear is the little death.
I'm...

323
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,473
The pain!

324
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,391
No! Enough!

325
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:10,271
Kull wahad!

326
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,108
No woman child
ever withstood that much.

327
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:22,241
Take your hand out of the box
and look at it, young human.

328
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,037
Do it!

329
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,420
Pain by nerve induction.

330
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:36,381
A human can resist any pain.

331
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:39,759
Our test is
crisis and observation.

332
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,552
I see the truth of it.

333
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,513
Could he be the one?

334
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:45,348
Maybe.

335
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,476
But will he be ours to control?

336
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,897
Tell me of your
home world, Usul.

337
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:59,821
Do you know of
the Water of Life?

338
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,408
The bile from the newborn
worms of Arrakis?

339
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,492
I have heard of it.

340
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,411
It is very dangerous.

341
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,914
The Bene Gesserit sisterhood
use it to see within.

342
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,209
There is a place

343
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,504
terrifying to us,

344
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,297
to women.

345
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,633
It is said

346
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:23,719
a man will come.

347
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:26,681
The Kwisatz Haderach.

348
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,059
He will go where we cannot.

349
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,522
Many men have tried.

350
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,233
They tried and failed?

351
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,569
They tried and died.

352
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:41,863
Jessica.

353
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,912
My son lives!

354
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,629
I sense your teachings in him.

355
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,091
Lgnore the regular order
of training.

356
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:04,427
His safety requires the Voice.

357
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,721
I've heard enough of my safety.

358
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,639
What about my father?

359
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,266
I heard your talking.

360
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,560
You speak as if he were dead.
Well, he's not!

361
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,978
Paul.
Well, he's not.

362
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,647
And he won't die.
Tell me he won't die.

363
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,483
What can be done has been done.

364
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,234
Mother, tell me!

365
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,887
Mentat Piter De Vries.

366
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,348
Message for
Mentat Piter De Vries.

367
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:53,184
The Baron is
impatient for Leto's reply.

368
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,356
It is by will alone
l set my mind in motion.

369
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,025
It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,

370
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,528
that lips acquire stains,
that stains become a warning.

371
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,489
It is by will alone
l set my mind in motion.

372
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,827
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.

373
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:14,372
It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,

374
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,707
that lips acquire stains,
that stains become a warning.

375
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:19,252
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.

376
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:23,941
My lord.

377
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:25,234
Piter!

378
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,530
The Atreides will be
leaving Caladan soon, Baron,

379
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,575
and l have here
your answer from Duke Leto.

380
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:35,119
What does Leto say, Piter?

381
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:38,039
He wishes to inform you
that vendetta,

382
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,958
as he puts it,
using the ancient tongue,

383
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:43,836
the art of kanly,
is still alive.

384
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:47,423
He does not wish
to meet or speak with you.

385
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,385
I've made my peace gesture.

386
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:55,097
The forms of kanly
have been obeyed.

387
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,893
Bring in Feyd and Rabban.

388
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,755
As you instructed me,

389
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,049
l have enlightened your nephews

390
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,384
concerning my plan...

391
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:32,760
My plan.

392
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:38,182
The plan to crush the Atreides.

393
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,726
Feyd,

394
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,771
Rabban,

395
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,232
go quietly.

396
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,903
No other great house
of the Landsraad

397
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:54,865
must ever know of the
Emperor's aid to the Baron.

398
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:59,870
The entire Landsraad
would turn against the Baron

399
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,665
and the Emperor.

400
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,042
Put the pick in there, Pete,

401
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:09,130
and turn it round real neat.

402
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,778
You are so beautiful, my Baron.

403
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,991
Your skin, love to me.

404
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,704
Your diseases
lovingly cared for,

405
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,873
for all eternity.

406
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,215
l will have
Arrakis back for myself!

407
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,761
He who controls the spice,
controls the Universe!

408
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,180
And what Piter did not tell you

409
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:02,558
is we have control of
someone who is very close,

410
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,311
very close to Duke Leto.

411
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,522
This person, this traitor

412
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:12,359
will be worth more to us
than 10 legions of Sardaukar.

413
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:14,403
And who is this traitor?

414
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,823
l won't tell you
who the traitor is,

415
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:19,742
or when we'll attack.

416
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,702
However,

417
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:25,581
the Duke will die before
these eyes and he'll know...

418
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,083
He'll know that it is l,

419
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:32,129
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen,
who encompasses his doom!

420
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,751
This is what I'll do
to the Duke and his family.

421
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,543
Oh, I'll miss Caladan so much.

422
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,527
Caladan.

423
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,418
Soon they will
begin to fold space.

424
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:01,630
Far off in the control
rooms of spice gas.

425
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:05,009
Traveling without moving.

426
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,399
And now,

427
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:27,442
the prophecy.

428
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:31,238
One will come.

429
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:35,534
The voice from the outer world.

430
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,579
Bringing the Holy War,

431
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:40,831
the Jihad,

432
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,917
which will
cleanse the Universe,

433
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,921
and bring us out of darkness.

434
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:18,035
House Atreides
took control of Arrakis

435
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:22,414
63 standard days
into the year 10191.

436
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,750
It was known that
the Harkonnens,

437
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,543
the former rulers of Arrakis

438
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:29,338
would leave many
suicide troops behind.

439
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,634
Atreides' patrols were doubled.

440
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,438
Duncan!

441
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,569
What have you discovered
about the Fremen, Duncan?

442
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:53,904
Tell me.

443
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:56,281
Why haven't we heard from you?

444
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:57,658
My lord,

445
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,576
l suspect so much.

446
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,705
I think they are
the allies we seek.

447
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,582
They are strong, fierce.

448
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:08,502
They do not give their
loyalty easily or quickly.

449
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:11,338
As you know,
the lmperium has never

450
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,548
been able to take
a census of the Fremen.

451
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:15,759
Everyone thinks
that there are but few

452
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,886
wandering here and there
in the desert.

453
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:19,596
My lord,

454
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:23,642
l suspect an incredible secret
has been kept on this planet.

455
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:27,437
That the Fremen exist
in vast numbers.

456
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:29,773
Vast.

457
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,361
And it is they
who control Arrakis.

458
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,036
Each trooper will be charged

459
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,539
with responsibility
for preserving water.

460
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,666
Our existence
as an operating army

461
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,794
depends on these following
water-saving procedures.

462
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,380
Remember, water is life.

463
00:43:57,385 --> 00:44:00,637
Why is the shield not yet up?

464
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:04,141
Sir, we found and removed
another sabotage device.

465
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:06,059
I think it'll go up now, sir.

466
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:14,026
They're finding these
sabotage devices too easily.

467
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:27,581
House shields activated.

468
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:36,506
Duke Leto is now here.

469
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:39,092
Spice mining inspection
to start immediately.

470
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,820
So you are Doctor Kynes.

471
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,114
The Judge of the Change.

472
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:03,367
And the imperial
Ecologist, Sire.

473
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:05,327
Our intelligence informs us

474
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:08,205
that there's still a strong
Harkonnen presence.

475
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:10,749
The process of
removal continues.

476
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:13,460
This is my son, Paul.

477
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:15,962
Are you a Fremen?

478
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:18,173
I've been on Arrakis
in the service of the Emperor

479
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,300
long enough
for my eyes to change.

480
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:22,594
In the service
of the Emperor.

481
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,388
We are in your hands, Doctor.

482
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:27,182
Your gift of the stillsuits
is much appreciated.

483
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:30,102
Will you give us an explanation
of their workings?

484
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,688
Well, this is a still suit
of Fremen manufacture,

485
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:35,607
the most efficient type
on Arrakis.

486
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:36,733
Basically...

487
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,406
it's all right, Gurney.

488
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:45,200
Yes, Sire.

489
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,661
Basically,

490
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,788
it's a high-efficiency
filter,

491
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,623
and heat exchange system.

492
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,876
Perspiration passes
through the first layer

493
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,671
and is gathered in the second.

494
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,673
The salt is separated.

495
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:03,343
Breathing and walking
provide the pumping action.

496
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,556
The reclaimed water
circulates to catch pockets

497
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:08,890
from which you can drink

498
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:12,227
through this tube
around your neck.

499
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:16,398
Urine and feces are processed
in the thigh pads.

500
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:19,734
Should you be
in the open desert,

501
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,821
remember to breathe in
through your mouth

502
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,490
and out through this nose tube.

503
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,201
With a Fremen suit
in good working condition,

504
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:30,620
life can be sustained
for weeks,

505
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:33,415
even in the deep desert, Sire.

506
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:36,543
My thanks.

507
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,045
With your permission.

508
00:46:41,174 --> 00:46:43,425
You've worn a stillsuit before.

509
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:44,801
No.

510
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:47,554
Your suit is
fitted desert fashion.

511
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,264
Who told you how to do that?

512
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:51,057
No one.

513
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:53,727
It seemed the proper way.

514
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,315
That it is.

515
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:01,860
He shall know
your ways as if born to them.

516
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:05,906
We're wasting time, Sire.

517
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:24,591
That language?
Translate it.

518
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,596
Very faint.

519
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,102
Harkonnen!

520
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,361
Air speed, zero-five.

521
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:48,615
Ambient temperature,
300 degrees Kelvin.

522
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,368
Air speed, three-zero.

523
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:57,958
...35% percent
efficiency.

524
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:06,049
That's where l told
your sandmaster

525
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,717
to concentrate
the harvesting today.

526
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:11,137
Southeast,
over the Shield Wall.

527
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:16,935
Ambient
temperature, 350 degrees Kelvin.

528
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,522
Air speed, one-three-zero.

529
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:25,777
Caution. You've now cleared
protective Shield Wall

530
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:28,405
and entered open desert.

531
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:38,957
Will we see a worm?

532
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,669
Where there is spice and spice
mining, there are always worms.

533
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,962
Always?

534
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,171
Always.

535
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,507
Why do they come?

536
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,552
To protect their territory.

537
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:53,096
Vibrations attract them.

538
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:55,849
He must be a
Fremen or in with them.

539
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:58,351
He's studying us.

540
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:00,979
He's hiding something
about the spice.

541
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:04,357
Is there a relationship between
the worms and the spice?

542
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:10,530
As l said, they defend
the spice sands.

543
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:14,743
As to their relationship
with the spice,

544
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,370
who knows?

545
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,930
My message, it's here.

546
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,020
There are more
enemy bodies coming in

547
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,564
for your inspection,
Doctor Yueh.

548
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:50,737
Are you all right?

549
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,530
Yes, I'm fine.

550
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,658
Thank you, Thufir.

551
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:00,372
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.

552
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:02,290
That's it. Spice mining.

553
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,585
No other cloud quite like it.

554
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,590
Wormsign?

555
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,133
Is it wormsign?

556
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,594
Yes. Worm. Big one.

557
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:17,764
You've got sharp eyes.
May l?

558
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,978
Calling Harvester Pad Nine.
Wormsign.

559
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,939
Who calls Pad Nine?

560
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,148
Don't mention the Duke.

561
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:29,359
This is an un-coded channel.

562
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:31,861
Unlisted flight
northeast of you.

563
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:33,905
Wormsign on intercept course.

564
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:36,908
Estimated contact, 15 minutes.

565
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,619
Have sighting confirmed.
Stand by for a fix.

566
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:41,955
Contact in 16 minutes minus.

567
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:44,124
Very precise estimate.

568
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:45,834
Who's on that unlisted flight?

569
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:49,921
What happens now?

570
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:51,047
The carryall will come

571
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:53,466
and lift off
the spice harvester.

572
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:56,636
Try to get in close
over the harvester.

573
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:59,180
You'll find this
interesting, Sire.

574
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,391
They work until
the very last minute.

575
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:04,436
Spotter control, there's
no sign of the carryall.

576
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:06,146
It isn't answering.

577
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:09,232
The worm is
eight minutes away, Sire.

578
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,818
Spotter control, give
me a report by the numbers.

579
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:13,069
Report One.

580
00:51:13,154 --> 00:51:14,154
No contact.

581
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:15,405
Report two.

582
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:16,698
Negative.

583
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:17,741
Report Three.

584
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:18,867
Negative, Sire.

585
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:19,909
Report four.

586
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:22,245
No contact.
Repeat, no contact.

587
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,205
I think they've
got our carryall.

588
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:26,624
Damn it! Harkonnens.

589
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:29,252
We're coming down to
take you off the harvester.

590
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,296
All spotters are
ordered to comply.

591
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:32,672
Ordered by whom?

592
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,215
Duke Leto Atreides.

593
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,426
Yes. Yes, Sire.

594
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,761
How many men do you have?

595
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:39,429
Full crew, 26 men.

596
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:42,015
But, Sire, we can't
leave all this spice.

597
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,433
Damn the spice!

598
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:44,809
Get out of there!

599
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,446
Two men in
each of the spotters!

600
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,114
You, over here!

601
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:01,034
Run! Run!

602
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,793
I can't see him yet,
but he is very close now.

603
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:13,129
Damn sloppy.
Really damn sloppy.

604
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:15,089
Come on, boys.
Come on.

605
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,887
We're going to be heavy, Sire.

606
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:22,972
Spice.

607
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:27,227
Pure unrefined spice.

608
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:35,944
Here he is!
We've got to go!

609
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,413
Bless the Maker and his water.

610
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,165
Bless the coming
and going of Him.

611
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:50,917
May His passing
cleanse the world.

612
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,086
What's that you're saying?

613
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:54,462
Nothing.

614
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,917
Gods, what a monster.

615
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:44,929
Someone is going to
pay for this, l promise.

616
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:51,102
He's more concerned
over his men than the spice.

617
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:55,440
I must admit,
against all better judgment,

618
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:57,901
l like this Duke.

619
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:47,909
My lady, the local people,

620
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:50,703
the maids and servants,
await your inspection.

621
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:53,039
Hawat has cleared them.

622
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,961
Excuse me, my lady.

623
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:02,966
The Harkonnens may have
tampered with them medically.

624
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,310
When you said Harkonnens,

625
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:19,065
l didn't know you had
so much reason to hate them.

626
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,237
Well, my wife...

627
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:29,283
But, of course, you...
You didn't know my wife.

628
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,578
The Har...

629
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,580
Forgive me.

630
00:55:34,707 --> 00:55:36,457
They must have killed her.

631
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:40,086
Please excuse me
if l can't talk about it.

632
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:48,761
He's holding something back.
Yet.

633
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,223
There's
the Imperial conditioning.

634
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:55,727
Assurance of trust.

635
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:05,862
The Bene
Gesserit mother, the legend.

636
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,448
Where is your son?

637
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:12,994
I must warn you.
You are in great danger.

638
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:17,290
Safe.

639
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,224
Spice.

640
00:56:53,786 --> 00:56:55,912
What is it doing to me?

641
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,509
Second moon.

642
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,846
The sleeper must awaken.

643
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:16,015
Am l the one?

644
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,864
A hunter-seeker!

645
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:34,325
It can't get me
if l don't move.

646
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:37,745
It's too dark in here
for it to see clearly.

647
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:56,472
I've got to try to grab it.

648
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,101
The suspensor field will make
it slippery on the bottom.

649
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:02,228
I must grip it tightly.

650
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,566
Who is operating that thing?

651
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:09,569
It has to be someone
in the palace.

652
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:11,821
I could shout for help,

653
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,073
but it would kill whoever
opened the door.

654
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,302
Hold still.

655
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:00,494
It would have killed me.

656
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:05,041
I was its target.
it went to the motion.

657
00:59:05,918 --> 00:59:07,418
Who are you?

658
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:09,587
I am the Shadout Mapes,

659
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,215
the housekeeper.

660
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:16,135
I must cleanse
the way between us.

661
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:20,973
You saved my life, and
we Fremen pay our debts.

662
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:22,600
A Fremen.

663
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,727
It is known to us

664
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:27,146
that you've a traitor
in your midst.

665
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:29,523
Who it is, we cannot say.

666
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:32,235
But we are certain of it.

667
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:43,829
A traitor.

668
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:58,219
Set up a sonar probe
immediately.

669
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:08,354
Harkonnen.

670
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:14,568
They've tried to take
the life of my son.

671
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:21,909
Sector 6 through 80
progress reports, Sire.

672
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:23,703
Take it, Thufir.

673
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,792
Sector 680, copy the 6th, the
summit, the 8th, quadrant over,

674
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:32,962
the 9th plus 84 circles, weave
the 80 and call the 4th. Copy.

675
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:42,179
8. Thufir Tawat, Mentat,
Master of assassins.

676
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:47,935
Uh, the palace is now secure.

677
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:52,106
The city of Arrakeen
is under martial law.

678
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:56,610
We have troops here
headquartered underground

679
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,238
on sub-floors
6 through 10.

680
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:01,782
The rest of the troops
are stationed in Arrakeen,

681
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:04,035
and we have some
on the airfield.

682
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:07,705
Our new army is still
in training, but everything,

683
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:09,415
everything is shielded.

684
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:12,626
And with this shielding
we are impenetrable.

685
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:08,224
Sleep well, my son.

686
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:21,570
Um, Father,

687
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:24,782
drugged.

688
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:34,125
Jessica, what is wrong?

689
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:36,961
Forgive me,
my beloved concubine.

690
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:39,630
I should have married you.

691
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:43,092
Why hold a dream
to ascend to the throne

692
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,136
through a political marriage?

693
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,140
I should have married you.

694
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:15,374
What happened?

695
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:39,023
Yueh!

696
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:41,066
He sabotaged
the house generators.

697
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:42,943
We are wide open!

698
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,658
House shield deactivating.

699
01:03:50,118 --> 01:03:53,204
I've destroyed the new army's
weirding modules.

700
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:55,664
I've brought
House Atreides down.

701
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:56,999
Why?

702
01:03:57,083 --> 01:04:00,920
I wish to kill a man.
Not you, my dear Duke.

703
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:03,380
You were already dead.

704
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,091
But you'll get close
to the Baron before you die.

705
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:09,803
You'll be tied and drugged,
but you can still attack.

706
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,264
You can still attack!

707
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,226
When you see the Baron,

708
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:18,270
you'll have a new
poison gas tooth.

709
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:22,942
He'll want you close,
so he can gloat over you.

710
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:28,447
One bite on this tooth
and a strong exhale...

711
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:30,741
Refuse.

712
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:31,992
No! You mustn't!

713
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,495
Because, in return,

714
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:37,998
I'll save the lives
of your Paul and Jessica.

715
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:44,505
For Paul.

716
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:50,094
Ahhh!

717
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:02,815
When you see the Baron,
remember the tooth.

718
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:06,527
The tooth! The tooth!

719
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:11,282
The shield is down!
The shield is down!

720
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:15,077
Open the doors!

721
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,288
Signals!

722
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,000
Get that shield up!

723
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:24,086
The shield! The shield!

724
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:50,863
The weirding modules!
Destroyed!

725
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:42,498
Long live Duke Leto!

726
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,564
The drug was timed.

727
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:13,278
Dr. Yueh has been
very valuable to us.

728
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:18,992
What a pity
you must remain gagged.

729
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:22,454
We can't let
ourselves be swayed

730
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,790
by your witch's voice,
now, can we?

731
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:28,377
Leto, where are you?

732
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:32,756
How simple to subdue us.

733
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:47,980
Goodbye, Jessica.

734
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:50,983
And goodbye to your sweet son.

735
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,737
I want to spit
once on your head.

736
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:57,698
Just some spittle in your face.

737
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:02,995
What a luxury!

738
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:11,170
We were ordered to kill them.
So kill them!

739
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,260
l wish this was Paul.

740
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:26,643
I knew Yueh's wife.

741
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:32,941
I was the one who broke
his imperial conditioning.

742
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:40,324
I've thought of
many pleasures with you.

743
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:44,703
It is perhaps
better that you die

744
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,955
in the innards of a worm.

745
01:08:58,051 --> 01:09:00,552
What are your orders, Piter?

746
01:09:00,929 --> 01:09:04,056
Take them to the desert,
as the traitor suggested.

747
01:09:05,016 --> 01:09:07,059
The worms will
destroy the evidence.

748
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:09,895
Their bodies
must never be found.

749
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:25,828
They're down on this floor
somewhere.

750
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:26,995
Down there.

751
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:48,183
Duncan!

752
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,022
Get off!

753
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,904
You wish now to join your wife?

754
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:02,948
Ls that it, traitor?

755
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,534
She lives?

756
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:07,160
You wish to join her?

757
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:12,541
Join her, then.

758
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,093
You think you've defeated me?

759
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:30,392
You think l don't know
what I've gained, for my wife!

760
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:38,817
Take him away.

761
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:02,841
Yueh's sign.

762
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:08,263
He's left us stillsuits.

763
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:19,149
Don't touch my mother!

764
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:21,068
He's trying the Voice.

765
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:23,278
The Reverend Mother
said it could save him.

766
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:26,114
Did you hear a noise
from the little one, huh?

767
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:29,159
No, l didn't hear anything.

768
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:34,206
The little one.

769
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:49,388
Remove her gag.

770
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:51,139
Excellent!

771
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:10,784
There's no
need to fight over me.

772
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:22,963
A poisoned blade.

773
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:37,436
First cut my son's bonds.

774
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:46,611
That's it.

775
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:01,043
Oh, my God.

776
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:13,430
It's under control.

777
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:46,046
Duke Leto Atreides.

778
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:52,636
Where is the ducal signet ring?

779
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:56,515
I must have his ring.

780
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:00,268
The ring!

781
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:06,817
He was brought to us
as is, my lord Baron.

782
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:11,404
You killed the doctor
too soon, you fool!

783
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:16,034
The doctor,
Yueh, what did he say?

784
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,870
Paul and Jessica safe.

785
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:21,581
Yes. The tooth!

786
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,875
He's coming around, Baron.

787
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:25,544
Where's your ring?

788
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:27,712
Huh?

789
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:30,090
You do not answer?

790
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:32,592
Wait! Wait!

791
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:35,428
You must come closer.

792
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:39,724
The water of my life

793
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:43,395
for Paul.

794
01:14:43,855 --> 01:14:47,149
He's crying.
He's crying!

795
01:14:48,192 --> 01:14:50,110
What does that mean, Piter?

796
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:55,574
Come closer, Baron.

797
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:02,581
No!

798
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:05,584
Jessica!

799
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:08,879
Leto!

800
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:12,090
Leto, he's dead!

801
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:14,092
No, he's dead!

802
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:16,469
I know.

803
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,937
Am l alive?

804
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:29,024
I'm alive?

805
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:30,150
Yes,

806
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:33,445
you're alive, my Baron.

807
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:36,031
I'm alive, eh?

808
01:15:36,616 --> 01:15:42,037
I'm alive!

809
01:15:50,922 --> 01:15:53,131
l can't maintain any altitude.

810
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,009
We'll never reach
the safety of rock!

811
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:02,015
Maybe that small rock.

812
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,309
Where are we, do you think?

813
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:06,228
The south polar regions.

814
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:10,148
The forbidden area.
Hold on.

815
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:20,492
Hurry!

816
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:25,205
Take the stillsuits!

817
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:28,250
Hurry!

818
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:30,293
This crash might bring a worm.

819
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:36,758
The signet.

820
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:39,719
A million deaths
are not enough for Yueh!

821
01:17:03,494 --> 01:17:05,203
Where are my feelings?

822
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,497
I feel for no one.

823
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:13,712
The second moon.

824
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:32,689
l mean Paul Atreides.

825
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,400
We want him killed.

826
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,402
Why?

827
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:39,904
Why do they want me killed?

828
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:42,866
It has to be something
to do with the spice.

829
01:17:43,743 --> 01:17:45,076
But what?

830
01:17:51,459 --> 01:17:55,170
He who controls the
spice, controls the Universe!

831
01:18:03,054 --> 01:18:05,638
This moon holds my future.

832
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:22,113
Never one drop of rain
on Arrakis.

833
01:18:25,785 --> 01:18:29,329
The sleeper must awaken.

834
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:40,048
They will call me,

835
01:18:40,466 --> 01:18:42,008
Muad'Dib.

836
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:52,560
Listen to me. Listen!

837
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,855
You wanted to know
about my dreams.

838
01:18:56,941 --> 01:18:59,359
Well, I've just had
a waking dream.

839
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:03,613
Do you know why?
The spice!

840
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:06,408
It's in everything here.

841
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:08,576
Calm yourself.

842
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:10,662
Like the Truthsayer drug.

843
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:13,748
It's a poison.

844
01:19:14,834 --> 01:19:17,669
You knew the spice
would change me.

845
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:19,838
But thanks to your teachings,

846
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:22,257
it's changing my consciousness.

847
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:25,009
I see it!
l can see it!

848
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:27,345
Is he the one?

849
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:31,224
You carry my unborn sister
in your womb.

850
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,892
He knows.

851
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:45,530
Father!

852
01:19:49,869 --> 01:19:52,704
Father, I promise,

853
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:55,582
one day
the sleeper will awaken.

854
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:58,960
And I will avenge your death.

855
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:02,422
I will not stop until I destroy

856
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:04,674
the Emperor and the Baron.

857
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:11,431
Father.

858
01:20:27,281 --> 01:20:28,865
Go now.

859
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:34,996
Take him to his desert to die.

860
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:38,416
Go.

861
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:12,575
Yueh's left the plan
for the weirding modules.

862
01:21:24,255 --> 01:21:26,589
We have to get to
that mountain of rock.

863
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,509
We have entered the time

864
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:32,220
when all will turn against us
and seek our lives.

865
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:50,154
It's further than l thought.

866
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:53,324
A worm is sure to come.

867
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:58,496
I'll plant this thumper.
That should divert it.

868
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:30,403
Remember, walk without rhythm,

869
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:31,946
and we won't attract a worm.

870
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:34,073
It will go to the thumper.

871
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:37,910
I'm ready.

872
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:20,912
Faster!

873
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:24,415
It's deafening!

874
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:39,991
Ooh!

875
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:43,786
The spice!

876
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:47,165
Do you smell it?

877
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:48,332
Yes!

878
01:24:55,758 --> 01:24:56,758
Paul!

879
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:27,371
A thumper.

880
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:38,216
The worm! Spice!

881
01:25:38,592 --> 01:25:40,009
Is there a relationship?

882
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:57,235
What's happened?
Why did it leave?

883
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:01,489
Someone started
another thumper.

884
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:05,868
We're not alone.

885
01:26:35,732 --> 01:26:37,525
Man-carved steps.

886
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:38,943
Yes.

887
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,959
Such stealth.

888
01:26:55,085 --> 01:26:56,711
I didn't hear them.

889
01:26:56,795 --> 01:27:00,214
Perhaps these are the
ones the Shadout Mapes told us of.

890
01:27:00,299 --> 01:27:01,966
I will take the boy-man.

891
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:05,094
He shall have sanctuary
in my tribe.

892
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:18,149
Get back!
She has the weirding way.

893
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:22,028
Great Gods!

894
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:25,156
If you can do this
to the strongest of us,

895
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:29,201
you're worth 10 times
your weight of water.

896
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:34,999
As the leader of my people,
l give you my bond.

897
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:38,502
Teach us this weirding way,

898
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:41,756
and you both
shall have sanctuary.

899
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:45,676
Your water shall
mingle with our water.

900
01:27:46,637 --> 01:27:48,638
Then l will teach you
our way of battle.

901
01:27:53,143 --> 01:27:56,479
l give you the word bond
of a Bene Gesserit.

902
01:27:57,022 --> 01:27:58,981
It is the legend.

903
01:28:04,571 --> 01:28:07,531
I am Chani, daughter of Liet.

904
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:12,203
I would not have permitted you
to harm my tribe.

905
01:28:13,664 --> 01:28:15,164
From my dreams.

906
01:28:16,083 --> 01:28:18,125
So beautiful.

907
01:28:19,086 --> 01:28:20,211
Come with me.

908
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:22,380
I'll show you
an easier way down.

909
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:43,067
You have strength.

910
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:45,820
You shall be known as Usul,

911
01:28:45,988 --> 01:28:48,781
which is the strength
of the base of the pillar.

912
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:51,742
This is your secret name
in our troop.

913
01:28:52,536 --> 01:28:55,538
But you must choose
the name of manhood,

914
01:28:55,622 --> 01:28:57,915
which we will call you openly.

915
01:29:00,919 --> 01:29:03,838
What do you call the mouse
shadow in the second moon?

916
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:09,760
We call that one Muad'Dib.

917
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:13,556
Could l be known
as Paul Muad'Dib?

918
01:29:14,433 --> 01:29:16,600
You are Paul Muad'Dib.

919
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:21,230
And your mother shall be
a Sayyadina among us.

920
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:23,733
We welcome you.

921
01:29:24,985 --> 01:29:27,778
The dream unfolds.

922
01:29:48,842 --> 01:29:50,009
Moisture!

923
01:29:50,427 --> 01:29:51,594
Wind traps.

924
01:29:52,471 --> 01:29:53,971
Huge ones.

925
01:30:04,858 --> 01:30:09,528
Water.
Millions of decaliters.

926
01:30:10,072 --> 01:30:11,655
A treasure.

927
01:30:11,782 --> 01:30:14,116
Greater than treasure, Usul.

928
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:17,870
We have thousands
of such caches,

929
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:22,124
and only a few of us
know them all.

930
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:25,002
And when we have enough,

931
01:30:25,712 --> 01:30:29,006
we shall change
the face of Arrakis.

932
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:50,945
Tell me
of your home world, Usul.

933
01:30:54,324 --> 01:30:56,742
Tell me
of your home world, Usul.

934
01:31:30,527 --> 01:31:33,320
Arrakis!

935
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:36,949
Rabban! Rabban!

936
01:31:39,077 --> 01:31:41,412
We're knee-deep
in Atreides blood!

937
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:45,040
We've gutted them!
We've gutted them!

938
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:52,214
Rabban! Rabban!

939
01:31:53,425 --> 01:31:56,302
I place you
in charge of Arrakis.

940
01:31:56,386 --> 01:31:59,263
It's yours to squeeze,
as l promised.

941
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:04,185
I want you to squeeze
and squeeze and squeeze!

942
01:32:04,269 --> 01:32:07,104
Give me spice!
Drive them!

943
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:09,565
Drive them
into utter submission!

944
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:12,443
Do not show
the slightest pity or mercy!

945
01:32:12,861 --> 01:32:15,613
Never stop! Go! Go!

946
01:32:15,697 --> 01:32:16,864
Show no mercy!

947
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:18,115
Yes, Baron!

948
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:40,095
Feyd.

949
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:54,944
And when we've crushed
these people enough,

950
01:32:55,862 --> 01:32:59,657
I'll send you. Feyd.

951
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:05,913
Lovely Feyd.

952
01:33:12,671 --> 01:33:14,838
Where's my doctor?

953
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:23,138
Jessica,

954
01:33:24,975 --> 01:33:27,059
our Reverend Mother is too old.

955
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:30,646
She has been calling
through space and time,

956
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:32,898
for you to come
and let her rest.

957
01:33:34,484 --> 01:33:37,236
She asks that you pass within,

958
01:33:38,071 --> 01:33:40,155
and become our Reverend Mother.

959
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:45,869
if you be a Reverend Mother,

960
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:51,792
let Shai-Hulud judge now!

961
01:33:55,505 --> 01:33:57,589
The Water of Life.

962
01:34:01,219 --> 01:34:03,721
But what of my unborn child?

963
01:34:05,307 --> 01:34:08,392
One day,
l will have to do this.

964
01:34:25,452 --> 01:34:27,494
Following
the Bene Gesserit tradition,

965
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:30,080
the old Reverend Mother
surrendered her life

966
01:34:30,248 --> 01:34:32,416
as she surrendered
her knowledge.

967
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:38,088
Jessica had successfully transmuted
the poisonous Water of Life.

968
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:42,176
Every man
who has tried has died.

969
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:45,220
Am l the one?

970
01:34:45,972 --> 01:34:48,766
The sleeper must awaken.

971
01:34:52,771 --> 01:34:55,230
The tremendous
power of the Water of Life

972
01:34:55,315 --> 01:34:59,360
caused the premature birth
of Jessica's daughter, Alia.

973
01:34:59,652 --> 01:35:01,570
Alia was born
with all the knowledge

974
01:35:01,654 --> 01:35:03,655
and powers of
a Reverend Mother.

975
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:22,633
Feyd, even
though he's aging,

976
01:35:22,801 --> 01:35:26,136
Thufir is one of the finest
Mentats in the Universe.

977
01:35:27,055 --> 01:35:30,808
And he's mine, Feyd, all mine.

978
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:35,479
Try it now.

979
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:36,563
I will.

980
01:35:36,648 --> 01:35:37,648
Come.

981
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:53,205
Oh, Thufir!

982
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:56,834
I see they've installed
your heart plug already.

983
01:35:58,378 --> 01:36:00,796
Don't be angry.
Everyone gets one here.

984
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,757
But this is not why we're here.

985
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:07,803
We've brought you
a little cat, Thufir.

986
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,348
You must care for it
if you wish to live.

987
01:36:12,892 --> 01:36:16,854
A poison has been introduced
into your body, Thufir Hawat.

988
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:21,275
By milking this, this smooth,
little cat body,

989
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:23,360
you receive your antidote.

990
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:25,696
It must be done each day.

991
01:36:28,867 --> 01:36:33,787
All l can see is an Atreides
that l want to kill.

992
01:36:34,581 --> 01:36:37,458
Feyd, no, no.

993
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:41,044
Thufir's a Harkonnen now.

994
01:36:42,046 --> 01:36:44,047
Aren't you, Thufir?

995
01:36:44,132 --> 01:36:48,010
My Duke, how I've failed you.

996
01:37:06,237 --> 01:37:08,155
Chani, l love you.

997
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:11,742
I've always loved you.

998
01:37:37,143 --> 01:37:39,436
The Holy Warriors.

999
01:37:40,522 --> 01:37:42,981
No one ever dreamed
there were so many.

1000
01:37:44,609 --> 01:37:48,946
I am Usul. Paul Muad'Dib.

1001
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:55,035
Our shared enemy,
the Harkonnens,

1002
01:37:58,957 --> 01:38:01,124
Stilgar, your leader,

1003
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:03,460
has asked me and my mother
to teach you

1004
01:38:03,545 --> 01:38:05,921
the weirding way
to crush the Harkonnens.

1005
01:38:07,674 --> 01:38:09,591
We must do more than this.

1006
01:38:10,468 --> 01:38:14,179
We must totally destroy all
spice production on Arrakis.

1007
01:38:15,765 --> 01:38:19,351
The Guild and the entire
Universe depends on spice.

1008
01:38:20,812 --> 01:38:23,814
He who can destroy a thing,
controls a thing.

1009
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:27,943
I will take 100 of your
warriors and train them.

1010
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:31,321
This 100 will train
the thousands that remain.

1011
01:38:32,365 --> 01:38:34,825
When the spice flow stops,

1012
01:38:34,909 --> 01:38:37,536
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.

1013
01:38:38,162 --> 01:38:40,122
The Baron
and the Emperor himself

1014
01:38:40,206 --> 01:38:42,040
will be forced to deal with us.

1015
01:38:45,253 --> 01:38:49,715
Arrakis will become
the center of the Universe.

1016
01:38:52,093 --> 01:38:53,176
Orato!

1017
01:38:57,181 --> 01:39:00,726
This obelisk is of
your hardest stone.

1018
01:39:02,687 --> 01:39:03,687
Kick it.

1019
01:39:10,612 --> 01:39:11,612
Hit it.

1020
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:18,160
Yell at it.

1021
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:25,459
Break!

1022
01:39:27,712 --> 01:39:30,297
Korba, cut it.

1023
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:44,686
Move back.

1024
01:40:14,092 --> 01:40:15,884
This is part
of the weirding way

1025
01:40:15,968 --> 01:40:17,511
that we will teach you.

1026
01:40:20,098 --> 01:40:23,600
Some thoughts
have a certain sound,

1027
01:40:24,519 --> 01:40:26,770
that being
the equivalent to a form.

1028
01:40:27,397 --> 01:40:29,523
Through sound and motion,

1029
01:40:29,941 --> 01:40:34,069
you will be able to paralyze
nerves, shatter bones,

1030
01:40:34,487 --> 01:40:38,782
set fires, suffocate an
enemy, or burst his organs.

1031
01:40:39,367 --> 01:40:40,450
We will kill

1032
01:40:40,535 --> 01:40:43,537
until no Harkonnen
breathes Arrakeen air.

1033
01:40:43,663 --> 01:40:46,081
Muad'Dib!

1034
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:51,128
Chaaksa.

1035
01:40:56,592 --> 01:40:57,801
Stilgar.

1036
01:41:00,513 --> 01:41:01,722
Muad'Dib.

1037
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:02,806
Hmm?

1038
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:05,851
Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

1039
01:41:10,231 --> 01:41:12,649
My name is a killing word.

1040
01:41:13,735 --> 01:41:15,318
They are ready to fight.

1041
01:41:15,403 --> 01:41:16,987
Yet in order to lead them,

1042
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:20,699
I must conquer the worm,
conquer Shai-Hulud.

1043
01:41:30,334 --> 01:41:33,086
Take the kiswa maker hook
of our sietch,

1044
01:41:33,838 --> 01:41:36,089
and ride as a leader of men.

1045
01:41:52,064 --> 01:41:54,691
Shai-Hulud.

1046
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:38,401
l must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.

1047
01:42:46,911 --> 01:42:49,704
Only the very strong ones
travel this deep.

1048
01:42:50,373 --> 01:42:52,916
Usul has called a big one!

1049
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:56,086
Again, it is the legend.

1050
01:44:34,352 --> 01:44:36,102
Muad'Dib!

1051
01:45:08,886 --> 01:45:12,472
Usul, these are 1
5 of our finest warriors

1052
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:15,976
to serve you as your guard.

1053
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:22,399
The Fedaykin.

1054
01:45:36,372 --> 01:45:37,372
Now.

1055
01:46:03,649 --> 01:46:07,152
When the spice flow stops,
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.

1056
01:46:07,945 --> 01:46:09,696
The Baron
and the Emperor himself

1057
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:11,406
will be forced to deal with us.

1058
01:46:15,411 --> 01:46:17,912
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

1059
01:46:17,997 --> 01:46:19,873
Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib.

1060
01:46:19,957 --> 01:46:21,499
What happened?
Muad'Dib.

1061
01:46:21,667 --> 01:46:23,543
What happened to you
and your men?

1062
01:46:23,627 --> 01:46:24,919
Muad'Dib!

1063
01:46:25,004 --> 01:46:26,713
What are you saying?
What are you saying?

1064
01:46:26,797 --> 01:46:29,924
Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!

1065
01:46:31,969 --> 01:46:35,472
He's been repeating that name
ever since we found him.

1066
01:46:35,556 --> 01:46:39,559
Who is this Muad'Dib?

1067
01:46:46,192 --> 01:46:49,069
In the two
standard years that followed,

1068
01:46:49,153 --> 01:46:50,528
Muad'Dib and the Fremen

1069
01:46:50,613 --> 01:46:53,615
brought spice production
to a standstill.

1070
01:46:54,033 --> 01:46:56,701
Fearing for his life,
Rabban did his best

1071
01:46:56,786 --> 01:47:00,038
to hide this fact
from his uncle, the Baron.

1072
01:47:06,837 --> 01:47:10,090
Paul's sister Alia matured
at a frightening rate.

1073
01:47:10,466 --> 01:47:13,510
Her small body harbored
tremendous powers.

1074
01:47:14,512 --> 01:47:17,138
Paul and Chant's love grew.

1075
01:47:22,645 --> 01:47:24,270
We surprised
a band of smugglers.

1076
01:47:24,355 --> 01:47:26,523
Too bad. l thought
they were Harkonnen.

1077
01:47:39,036 --> 01:47:40,203
Gurney!

1078
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:46,459
You've no need of your weapons
with me, Gurney Halleek.

1079
01:47:47,211 --> 01:47:48,211
Paul.

1080
01:47:50,339 --> 01:47:51,339
Paul!

1081
01:47:51,423 --> 01:47:53,091
Don't you trust your own eyes?

1082
01:47:53,217 --> 01:47:54,926
They said you were dead.

1083
01:47:57,555 --> 01:47:58,555
They...

1084
01:47:59,515 --> 01:48:00,515
They said...

1085
01:48:06,230 --> 01:48:08,273
Gurney! Gurney! Gurney!
You young pup!

1086
01:48:08,357 --> 01:48:09,315
Gurney!

1087
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:10,400
You young pup!

1088
01:48:27,668 --> 01:48:29,794
Emperor Shaddam lV,

1089
01:48:29,879 --> 01:48:31,754
you have one last chance

1090
01:48:31,839 --> 01:48:33,840
to take matters
into your own hands,

1091
01:48:33,924 --> 01:48:37,260
and bring the situation
under control on Arrakis.

1092
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:38,553
What do you mean,
one last...

1093
01:48:38,637 --> 01:48:39,846
Silence. Do not speak.

1094
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:43,808
Listen. You do not have more
than this one chance.

1095
01:48:44,101 --> 01:48:46,686
I represent the entire Guild
in this matter.

1096
01:48:47,438 --> 01:48:48,688
Our navigators warn you

1097
01:48:48,772 --> 01:48:51,316
that spice production
is in great danger.

1098
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:53,401
A new Fremen leader, Muad'Dib,

1099
01:48:53,485 --> 01:48:55,820
has stopped spice mining
on Arrakis.

1100
01:48:56,113 --> 01:48:59,407
Our navigators suggest
he is not of Arrakis.

1101
01:48:59,491 --> 01:49:02,243
No one on the outside world
has been able to see him.

1102
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:04,621
We do not know who he is.

1103
01:49:04,830 --> 01:49:06,956
The Harkonnens cannot stop him.

1104
01:49:07,917 --> 01:49:11,377
Remedy this situation,
restore spice production,

1105
01:49:11,462 --> 01:49:14,464
or you'll live out your life
in a pain amplifier.

1106
01:49:22,473 --> 01:49:23,932
The Emperor will stop him.

1107
01:49:24,016 --> 01:49:25,975
He won't take
the Water of Life.

1108
01:49:26,810 --> 01:49:28,978
That's why
they want me killed.

1109
01:49:29,063 --> 01:49:31,481
They're afraid
I'll take the Water of Life.

1110
01:49:32,650 --> 01:49:36,110
I want 50 legions of Sardaukar
on Arrakis at once!

1111
01:49:36,487 --> 01:49:38,071
50 legions?

1112
01:49:38,197 --> 01:49:39,822
That's our entire
reserves as well.

1113
01:49:39,907 --> 01:49:41,157
This is genocide,

1114
01:49:41,242 --> 01:49:43,284
the deliberate
and systematic destruction

1115
01:49:43,369 --> 01:49:45,703
of all life on Arrakis!

1116
01:49:47,289 --> 01:49:50,792
The Emperor is coming!
Chani! Chani!

1117
01:49:53,337 --> 01:49:57,340
You were calling my name.
it frightened me.

1118
01:49:58,300 --> 01:49:59,467
Oh, Chani.

1119
01:50:00,803 --> 01:50:03,012
All the images
of my future are gone.

1120
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:08,017
I have to drink
the Water of Life.

1121
01:50:08,269 --> 01:50:10,687
No, Paul, please.

1122
01:50:11,146 --> 01:50:12,897
I've seen the men
who have tried.

1123
01:50:13,023 --> 01:50:14,774
I've seen how they died.

1124
01:50:14,858 --> 01:50:18,695
I'm dead to everyone unless
l try to become what l may be.

1125
01:50:21,699 --> 01:50:24,200
Only the Water of Life
will free what can save us.

1126
01:50:30,874 --> 01:50:32,834
l must drink the sacred water.

1127
01:50:36,130 --> 01:50:37,714
I must go now.

1128
01:51:32,644 --> 01:51:35,938
Hurry. All l see
is darkness.

1129
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:37,940
Paul.

1130
01:51:40,694 --> 01:51:45,114
I will love you forever.
You are my life.

1131
01:51:55,292 --> 01:51:56,584
You are my life.

1132
01:52:03,175 --> 01:52:05,218
Many men have tried.

1133
01:52:05,803 --> 01:52:07,845
They tried and failed?

1134
01:52:07,971 --> 01:52:09,639
They tried and died.

1135
01:52:18,357 --> 01:52:20,233
The worm is the spice.

1136
01:52:20,317 --> 01:52:22,235
The spice is the worm.

1137
01:52:42,423 --> 01:52:44,507
The worms.

1138
01:53:01,150 --> 01:53:03,484
They're not attacking.
Why?

1139
01:53:22,379 --> 01:53:23,546
Alia.

1140
01:53:25,215 --> 01:53:26,340
Mother.

1141
01:53:28,385 --> 01:53:30,219
It's Paul.

1142
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:35,475
He's taken the Water of Life.

1143
01:53:45,569 --> 01:53:49,906
There is a
place, terrifying to us,

1144
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:51,741
to women.

1145
01:53:52,075 --> 01:53:54,744
This is the place
they cannot look.

1146
01:54:01,752 --> 01:54:04,795
Traveling without moving.

1147
01:54:06,423 --> 01:54:09,008
Now I truly control the worm

1148
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:12,053
and the spice.

1149
01:54:13,263 --> 01:54:17,433
And I have the power
to destroy the spice forever!

1150
01:54:47,839 --> 01:54:51,133
Paul.

1151
01:55:01,061 --> 01:55:07,024
Father!

1152
01:55:07,526 --> 01:55:10,486
The sleeper has awakened!

1153
01:55:19,121 --> 01:55:21,122
Muad'Dib.

1154
01:55:28,922 --> 01:55:32,508
Arrakis, Dune,

1155
01:55:34,553 --> 01:55:35,803
Desert Planet.

1156
01:55:37,556 --> 01:55:39,557
Your time has come.

1157
01:55:40,350 --> 01:55:42,184
A storm is coming.

1158
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:44,520
Our storm.

1159
01:55:46,023 --> 01:55:49,317
And when it arrives,
it will shake the Universe.

1160
01:55:51,862 --> 01:55:55,489
Emperor, we come for you!

1161
01:55:57,492 --> 01:55:59,160
We come for you!

1162
01:56:13,842 --> 01:56:16,636
Long live the fighters!

1163
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:19,972
Long live the fighters!

1164
01:56:51,296 --> 01:56:52,838
Suspicion confirmed.

1165
01:56:52,923 --> 01:56:54,924
The Emperor's
had Rabban seized.

1166
01:57:37,968 --> 01:57:40,761
Gurney, when the storm hits,
set off the atomics.

1167
01:57:41,972 --> 01:57:44,890
I want an opening through
the entire shield wall.

1168
01:57:46,476 --> 01:57:49,270
Stilgar, do we have wormsign?

1169
01:57:52,441 --> 01:57:53,858
Usul, we have wormsign,

1170
01:57:53,942 --> 01:57:56,485
the likes of which
even God has never seen.

1171
01:58:52,876 --> 01:58:56,962
Bring in that
floating fat man, the Baron.

1172
01:59:13,230 --> 01:59:15,064
Why have you brought me here?

1173
01:59:15,232 --> 01:59:18,734
Your Highness,
there must be some mistake.

1174
01:59:19,361 --> 01:59:20,986
I never requested
your presence.

1175
01:59:21,238 --> 01:59:22,238
Ah.

1176
01:59:22,739 --> 01:59:25,074
But your lack of action
demanded it.

1177
01:59:25,158 --> 01:59:27,535
Your dreadful mismanagement,
your bad judgment

1178
01:59:27,619 --> 01:59:30,704
in assigning to Rabban
the governorship.

1179
01:59:31,122 --> 01:59:32,331
You've forced me to come here

1180
01:59:32,415 --> 01:59:35,000
and set things straight,
personally.

1181
01:59:45,262 --> 01:59:49,223
l am a messenger
from Muad'Dib.

1182
01:59:49,850 --> 01:59:51,642
Poor Emperor.

1183
01:59:52,143 --> 01:59:55,938
I'm afraid my brother won't
be very pleased with you.

1184
01:59:56,022 --> 01:59:57,147
Silence!

1185
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:59,441
Kill this child.
She's an abomination.

1186
01:59:59,651 --> 02:00:01,652
Kill her. Kill her.

1187
02:00:01,862 --> 02:00:04,738
Get out of my mind!

1188
02:00:04,823 --> 02:00:07,449
Not until you tell them both

1189
02:00:07,534 --> 02:00:10,578
who l really am.

1190
02:00:12,163 --> 02:00:13,455
Alia,

1191
02:00:15,625 --> 02:00:18,794
daughter of Duke Leto the Just,

1192
02:00:19,087 --> 02:00:22,298
and the royal Lady Jessica.

1193
02:00:22,799 --> 02:00:24,008
Sister

1194
02:00:24,926 --> 02:00:28,679
of Paul Muad'Dib.

1195
02:00:28,805 --> 02:00:32,600
Paul's sister?
Paul is Muad'Dib?

1196
02:00:37,564 --> 02:00:39,481
Alia keeps pace with the storm.

1197
02:00:44,529 --> 02:00:47,489
With the storm, their
air power will be useless.

1198
02:00:48,074 --> 02:00:51,035
On Arrakis, it's desert power.

1199
02:00:51,328 --> 02:00:52,328
Gurney.

1200
02:00:54,122 --> 02:00:55,122
Now!

1201
02:00:55,206 --> 02:00:56,332
Atomics!

1202
02:01:31,910 --> 02:01:37,039
My brother is coming
with many Fremen warriors.

1203
02:01:38,583 --> 02:01:39,750
Lmpossible!

1204
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:41,961
Not impossible.

1205
02:01:42,045 --> 02:01:45,339
I told you.
He is here now.

1206
02:01:52,263 --> 02:01:55,432
Father, today
I will avenge your death.

1207
02:02:19,124 --> 02:02:22,251
Emperor, an
impassable storm has descended.

1208
02:02:22,377 --> 02:02:25,462
The Shield Wall has been
penetrated by atomics.

1209
02:02:27,215 --> 02:02:28,549
Release the Sardaukar.

1210
02:02:29,009 --> 02:02:33,554
Baron, give this little
abomination to the storm.

1211
02:02:34,514 --> 02:02:37,099
Wait for my brother, Baron.

1212
02:03:24,481 --> 02:03:25,606
Chaa!

1213
02:04:21,037 --> 02:04:22,037
Cha.

1214
02:04:24,499 --> 02:04:26,083
Wait for my brother.

1215
02:04:32,632 --> 02:04:35,467
Cha!

1216
02:04:39,848 --> 02:04:41,974
Muad'Dib!

1217
02:05:23,266 --> 02:05:28,270
Eee-sah!

1218
02:05:32,066 --> 02:05:33,066
Cha!

1219
02:05:37,864 --> 02:05:39,323
Alia, now.

1220
02:05:39,407 --> 02:05:41,116
Come to me, Baron.

1221
02:06:55,358 --> 02:06:57,025
Muad'Dib!

1222
02:07:42,071 --> 02:07:43,905
Feyd Rautha.

1223
02:07:44,073 --> 02:07:46,742
Emperor Shaddam lV,

1224
02:07:46,826 --> 02:07:48,702
there are Guild Heighliners
above us,

1225
02:07:48,786 --> 02:07:51,246
containing many Great Houses
of the Landsraad.

1226
02:07:51,456 --> 02:07:52,831
Send them back.

1227
02:07:52,915 --> 02:07:54,833
How dare
you speak to me in...

1228
02:07:54,917 --> 02:07:56,793
Stop your speaking.

1229
02:07:58,921 --> 02:08:00,964
You have some idea
of what l could do.

1230
02:08:04,135 --> 02:08:07,012
Don't try your powers on me.

1231
02:08:08,139 --> 02:08:10,432
Try looking into that place
where you dare not look.

1232
02:08:10,516 --> 02:08:12,517
You'll find me there
staring back at you.

1233
02:08:12,602 --> 02:08:14,102
You mustn't speak...

1234
02:08:14,187 --> 02:08:15,354
Silence!

1235
02:08:18,733 --> 02:08:20,567
l remember your gom jabbar.

1236
02:08:21,694 --> 02:08:23,403
Now you'll remember mine.

1237
02:08:23,488 --> 02:08:25,280
I can kill with a word.

1238
02:08:27,784 --> 02:08:30,744
And his word shall carry
death eternal

1239
02:08:31,079 --> 02:08:33,205
to those who stand
against the righteous.

1240
02:08:33,289 --> 02:08:34,706
The righteous?

1241
02:08:34,791 --> 02:08:36,750
There is a Harkonnen among you.

1242
02:08:39,504 --> 02:08:43,423
Give the Harkonnen a blade,
and let him stand forth.

1243
02:08:43,508 --> 02:08:44,633
If Feyd wishes,

1244
02:08:44,717 --> 02:08:47,052
he can meet you
with my blade in his hand.

1245
02:08:47,136 --> 02:08:48,387
I wish it.

1246
02:08:48,471 --> 02:08:50,472
This is a Harkonnen animal.

1247
02:08:51,432 --> 02:08:53,892
Let me. Please, my lord.

1248
02:08:54,227 --> 02:08:56,144
The Emperor's blade.

1249
02:09:26,676 --> 02:09:29,428
Why prolong the inevitable?

1250
02:09:31,973 --> 02:09:33,348
l will kill you.

1251
02:09:49,157 --> 02:09:50,699
l will kill him!

1252
02:09:57,707 --> 02:09:58,707
Paul!

1253
02:10:00,126 --> 02:10:01,960
I will kill him!

1254
02:10:11,554 --> 02:10:15,182
Who is the little one?
A pet, perhaps?

1255
02:10:16,392 --> 02:10:19,227
Will she deserve
my special attentions?

1256
02:10:26,486 --> 02:10:27,611
Poisoned.

1257
02:10:30,823 --> 02:10:33,658
You see your death.

1258
02:10:34,410 --> 02:10:36,077
My blade will finish you.

1259
02:10:38,623 --> 02:10:41,917
I will bend like
a reed in the wind.

1260
02:10:57,141 --> 02:10:58,141
Chaaksa!

1261
02:11:06,192 --> 02:11:07,734
Muad'Dib.

1262
02:11:08,569 --> 02:11:10,695
Usul no longer needs
the weirding module.

1263
02:11:12,073 --> 02:11:14,950
Muad'Dib
had become the hand of God,

1264
02:11:15,660 --> 02:11:17,869
fulfilling the Fremen prophecy.

1265
02:11:18,454 --> 02:11:19,538
Where there was war,

1266
02:11:19,622 --> 02:11:22,040
Muad'Dib would now bring peace.

1267
02:11:22,375 --> 02:11:25,752
Where there was hatred,
Muad'Dib would bring love,

1268
02:11:26,254 --> 02:11:28,588
to lead the people
to true freedom,

1269
02:11:29,382 --> 02:11:32,467
and to change
the face of Arrakis.

1270
02:11:35,972 --> 02:11:37,889
We Fremen have a saying.

1271
02:11:38,975 --> 02:11:41,977
God created Arrakis
to train the faithful.

1272
02:11:43,479 --> 02:11:46,106
One cannot go
against the word of God.

1273
02:12:43,873 --> 02:12:45,832
And how can this be?

1274
02:12:48,377 --> 02:12:51,796
For he is the Kwisatz Haderach.

1275
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:55,105
