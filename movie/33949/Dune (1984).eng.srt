1
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,650
<i>In the year 6041,</i>

2
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,300
<i>before the reign of the Padishah Emperors,</i>

3
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,600
<i>the Universe was ruled by
thinking machines with human minds.</i>

4
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,200
<i>Computers and conscious robots.</i>

5
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,350
<i>The people deteriorated
into a state of apathy.</i>

6
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,250
<i>Then they became victims and slaves
of other men with machines.</i>

7
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,350
<i>Finally came the Great Revolt,</i>

8
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,050
<i>the religious crusade against the machines.</i>

9
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,250
<i>After the Great Revolt,</i>

10
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,250
<i>human beings were forced
to develop their minds.</i>

11
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,500
<i>Thus mental training schools
were established.</i>

12
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,300
<i>These schools would change
the history of the Universe.</i>

13
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,250
<i>Only two of these ancient
mental training schools remain.</i>

14
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,700
<i>One is the Bene Gesserit school,</i>

15
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,950
<i>which was established
primarily for female students.</i>

16
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,900
<i>The function of the Bene Gesserit school</i>

17
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,600
<i>is to carry on a selective
breeding program among humans.</i>

18
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,100
<i>Now, the other existing school,</i>

19
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,100
<i>the Spacing Guild, or the Guild,</i>

20
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,100
<i>emphasizes pure mathematics.</i>

21
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,800
<i>The Guild's Space Navigators,</i>

22
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,600
<i>through the use of the orange spice drug,</i>

23
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,900
<i>are able to fold space.</i>

24
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,100
<i>That is, to guide spaceships</i>

25
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,850
<i>without moving from one planet to another.</i>

26
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,300
<i>It is through the Guild's monopolies</i>

27
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,650
<i>on the economic life of the Universe</i>

28
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
<i>that makes it so powerful.</i>

29
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,200
<i>Know then</i>

30
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,050
<i>that it is the year 10192.</i>

31
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,500
<i>The Known Universe is ruled by</i>

32
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,200
<i>the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV.</i>

33
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,100
<i>For many years,</i>

34
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,700
<i>the Emperor Shaddam IV
has ruled on planet Kaitain</i>

35
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,000
<i>over all the great houses of the Landsraad.</i>

36
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,250
<i>The great houses of the Landsraad</i>

37
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,450
<i>are members of the royal families,</i>

38
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,050
<i>who rule or govern over the
major planets of the Universe</i>

39
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,450
<i>according to the ancient
feudal system of government.</i>

40
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,250
<i>Two of the great houses
of the Landsraad are</i>

41
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,500
<i>the House of Atreides
on planet Caladan</i>

42
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,100
<i>ruled by Duke Leto Atreides</i>

43
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,750
<i>and the House of Harkonnen
on the planet Giedi Prime</i>

44
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,100
<i>ruled by the Baron
Vladimir Harkonnen.</i>

45
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,600
<i>In this time,</i>

46
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,250
<i>the most precious substance
in the Universe</i>

47
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,500
<i>is the spice melange.</i>

48
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,350
<i>The spice extends life.</i>

49
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,300
<i>The spice expands consciousness.</i>

50
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,000
<i>The spice is vital to space travel.</i>

51
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,850
<i>CHOAM company controls
the mining of the spice.</i>

52
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,500
<i>The CHOAM company is controlled</i>

53
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,700
<i>by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV</i>

54
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,400
<i>and the great houses of the Landsraad</i>

55
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,400
<i>with the Guild and the Bene
Gesserit as silent partners.</i>

56
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,050
<i>This combine is the key to the wealth</i>

57
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,350
<i>and political power of the Universe.</i>

58
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,050
<i>It is the Emperor Shaddam IV</i>

59
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,500
<i>who dispenses CHOAM
directorships and contracts</i>

60
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,400
<i>to the various great houses
of the Landsraad.</i>

61
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
<i>The spice exists on only one planet
in the entire Universe.</i>

62
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,400
<i>A desolate, dry planet with vast deserts.</i>

63
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,150
<i>The planet Dune, also known as Arrakis.</i>

64
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,950
<i>Up until this time,
the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen</i>

65
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,350
<i>has held a directorship
from the Emperor Shaddam IV,</i>

66
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,800
<i>giving him a contract to mine
the spice on planet Arrakis.</i>

67
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,200
<i>The Baron Vladimir,
with his two nephews,</i>

68
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,950
<i>the Count Rabban and Feyd Harkonnen,</i>

69
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,500
<i>live on the planet Giedi Prime.</i>

70
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,550
<i>The planet Caladan is ruled
by Duke Leto Atreides,</i>

71
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,000
<i>cousin to the Emperor Shaddam IV.</i>

72
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,200
<i>He resides in the ancient Castle Caladan</i>

73
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,700
<i>with the Bene Gesserit
Lady Jessica, and their son,</i>

74
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,300
<i>the ducal heir, Paul Atreides.</i>

75
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,650
<i>The Emperor, fearful of the
Duke's increasing popularity</i>

76
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,400
<i>among the great houses
of the Landsraad</i>

77
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,250
<i>has conspired with the Duke's
mortal enemies,</i>

78
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,700
<i>the Harkonnens, to destroy
the House of Atreides.</i>

79
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,600
<i>A secret report within the Guild...</i>

80
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,400
<i>"Four planets have come
to our attention regarding a plot,</i>

81
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,200
<i>"which could jeopardize
the spice production.</i>

82

<i>"Planet Arrakis:

<i>"The spice must flow."</i>

89
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,750
Father?

90
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,350
Irulan, you must leave.

91
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,000
Why does the Guild send
a third-stage Navigator here?

92
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,450
The spice.

93
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,050
It has to be.

94
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,350
He senses my plan.

95
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,800
My lord, the Reverend Mother is here.

96
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,900
All entrance corridors and
chambers have been cleared.

97
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,150
We are dismissed?

98
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,300
Yes, yes, he'll sense the least surveillance.

99
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,700
No eavesdropping of any kind.

100
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,750
A third-stage Guild Navigator
will be here within minutes.

101
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,050
We felt his presence.

102
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,650
I shall want telepathy during his visit

103
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,850
and a report when we're finished.

104
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,250
Their minds are so...

105
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:32,600
They move in strange directions.

106
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,000
Yes?

107
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,950
Forced spice evolution with
humans changes many things.

108
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,800
I must sit close to him.

109
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,850
He will not permit anyone
but me to see him.

110
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,600
You must be outside this room.

111
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,000
I am your Truthsayer, my lord.

112
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,850
He's here, my lord.

113
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,350
<i>The Bene Gesserit witch must leave.</i>

114
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,000
Leave us.

115
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,900
Yes, my lord.

116
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,350
We are alone.

117
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,850
<i>We have just folded space from Ix.</i>

118
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,250
Yes?

119
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,150
How was your journey?

120
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,800
<i>Many machines on Ix.</i>

121
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,700
<i>New machines.</i>

122
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,150
Oh?

123
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,900
Yes?

124
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,600
<i>Better than those on Richese.</i>

125
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,600
<i>You are transparent.</i>

126
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,850
<i>I see many things.</i>

127
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,550
<i>I see plans within plans.</i>

128
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,100
Is there a problem?

129
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,950
Usually there's a problem
when one of you makes a visit.

130
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,700
<i>The answer is within the problem.</i>

131
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,250
<i>I see two great houses,</i>

132
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:16,950
<i>House Atreides,
House Harkonnen feuding.</i>

133
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,100
<i>I see you behind it.</i>

134
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,550
Yes.

135
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,800
<i>You must share with us.</i>

136
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,950
Duke Atreides' House
is building a secret army

137
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,050
using a technique unknown to us.

138
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,150
A technique involving sound.

139
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,900
The Duke is becoming
more popular in the Landsraad.

140
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,750
He could threaten me.

141
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,900
I have ordered Duke Atreides
to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice,

142
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,150
thus replacing their enemies,
the Baron Harkonnen.

143
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,250
The Duke will not refuse,
because of the tremendous power

144
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,850
they think they will gain.

145
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,650
Then, at an appointed time,

146
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,650
Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis

147
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,400
and launch a sneak attack
on Duke Atreides.

148
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,950
I have promised the Baron

149
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,200
five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.

150
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:09,050
<i>So, the Harkonnens will
rid you of House Atreides.</i>

151
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,450
Yes.

152
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,450
<i>Listen to me. The spice must flow.</i>

153
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,700
<i>The spice has given me accelerated
evolution for 4,000 years.</i>

154
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,850
<i>It has enabled you to live 200.</i>

155
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,000
<i>It gives the Bene Gesserit sisterhoods</i>

156
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,250
<i>the metaphysical ability to see beyond.</i>

157
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,900
<i>You want superior powers.</i>

158
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,800
<i>Our power to fold space is in the spice.</i>

159
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,050
<i>Without us, your empire will be lost.</i>

160
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:37,050
<i>On isolated scattered planets,
you would be lost.</i>

161
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,900
<i>One small point.</i>

162
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,150
<i>Here it comes.</i>

163
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,650
<i>We, ourselves, foresee a slight problem</i>

164
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,850
<i>within the House Atreides.</i>

165
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,350
<i>Paul. Paul Atreides.</i>

166
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,750
You mean, of course,
Duke Leto Atreides, his father?

167
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,450
<i>I mean Paul Atreides.</i>

168
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,100
<i>We want him killed.</i>

169
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,500
<i>I did not say this.</i>

170
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,850
<i>I am not here.</i>

171
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,150
I understand.

172
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:46,400
<i>Why would they want the Duke's son killed?</i>

173
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,250
Well?

174
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,300
They fear that putting House Atreides
on Arrakis will hurt spice production.

175
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,000
For us,

176
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,600
a small amount is enough
to greatly extend our lives.

177
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,300
But they consume tremendous quantities.

178
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:09,350
A great deal is needed
to evolve the seeing eye.

179
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,550
They worry.

180
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,500
The Universe worries when they worry.

181
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,650
What else?

182
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,350
So much was unclear.

183
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,950
You may go, Helen Mohiam,

184
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,350
Bene Gesserit.

185
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,400
Yes, my lord.

186
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,900
She's Bene Gesserit.

187
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,200
There's nowhere in the Universe
you can escape them.

188
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,300
Her loyalty to the sisterhood is
stronger than her loyalty to me.

189
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,200
Watch her carefully.

190
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:49,500
Why would they want the Duke's son killed?

191
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,950
We must have a look at Paul Atreides.

192
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,100
On Caladan.

193
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,150
<i>I mean Paul Atreides.</i>

194
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,950
<i>We want him killed.</i>

195
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,350
<i>Why would they want the Duke's son killed?</i>

196
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:34,850
<i>We must have a look at Paul Atreides.</i>

197
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,150
<i>On Caladan.</i>

198
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,000
<i>The powerful Bene Gesserit sisterhood,</i>

199
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,450
<i>for 90 generations,</i>

200
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,600
<i>has been manipulating bloodlines</i>

201
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,100
<i>to produce the Kwisatz Haderach.</i>

202
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,050
<i>A super being.</i>

203
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,600
<i>On Caladan, Jessica,</i>

204
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,700
<i>a member of the sisterhood
and the bound concubine</i>

205
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,600
<i>of Duke Leto Atreides</i>

206
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,000
<i>had been ordered to bear only daughters.</i>

207
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,650
<i>Because of her love for the Duke,</i>

208
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,050
<i>she disobeyed and gave
birth to a son, Paul.</i>

209
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,250
<i>Paul Atreides.</i>

210
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Here we are now. Caladan.

211
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,150
<i>And 19 light-years beyond.</i>

212
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
<i>Beyond Bene Tleilax.</i>

213
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,200
<i>The training planet of the Mentats,</i>

214
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,700
<i>the human computers.</i>

215
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,900
<i>Know a Mentat by his red-stained lips.</i>

216
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
<i>There, Arrakis.</i>

217
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,000
<i>Spice Mining.</i>

218
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,000
<i>Carryalls lower the harvester to the sand,</i>

219
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,750
<i>and lift it off to safety
when a worm attacks.</i>

220
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,700
<i>Worms attack all rhythmic vibrations.</i>

221
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,050
<i>Weather. See storms. No Precipitation.</i>

222
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,200
<i>Never one drop of rain on Arrakis.</i>

223
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,500
<i>And the Harkonnens are near. There.</i>

224
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,200
<i>Giedi Prime and the Baron Harkonnen.</i>

225
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,650
<i>The enemy.</i>

226
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,100
<i>Saguaro, burrow bush,</i>

227
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,400
<i>creosote bush, barrel cactus...</i>

228
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,850
<i>The beginning is a very delicate time.</i>

229
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,350
<i>Know then, that it is the year 10191.</i>

230
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,250
<i>Gurney Halleck, a troubadour-warrior,</i>

231
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:44,350
<i>is companion and teacher to Paul Atreides.</i>

232
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,650
<i>Dr. Wellington Yueh,</i>

233
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,600
<i>Royal Physician to the House of Atreides.</i>

234
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
<i>He wears the diamond tattoo of
imperial conditioning on his forehead.</i>

235
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,000
<i>This signifies that he has had
the highest conditioning</i>

236
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,150
<i>against taking human life.</i>

237
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,750
<i>Therefore, this makes him safe enough
to attend to even an emperor.</i>

238
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,200
<i>The spice is vital to space travel.</i>

239
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,050
<i>The Spacing Guild...</i>

240
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,300
<i>Among those who serve
Duke Leto Atreides</i>

241
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,850
<i>is Thufir Hawat,</i>

242
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,850
<i>Mentat Master of Assassins
to the House of Atreides.</i>

243
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,900
<i>A Mentat is a human being
who is trained and conditioned</i>

244
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,450
<i>for supreme accomplishments of logic.</i>

245
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,900
<i>A human computer to perform certain duties.</i>

246
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,500
I know, Thufir, I'm sitting
with my back to the door.

247
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,700
I heard you, Doctor Yueh,

248
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,300
and Gurney coming down the hall.

249
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,850
Those sounds

250
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,050
could be imitated!

251
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,150
I'd know the difference.

252
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:50,350
<i>Yes. Perhaps he would at that.</i>

253
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,350
My father sent you to test me.

254
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,100
Music, then?

255
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,650
No music.

256
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,750
I'm packing this for the crossing.

257
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
Shield practice.

258
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,600
Shield practice?

259
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,950
Gurney, we had practice this morning.

260
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,300
I'm not in the mood.

261
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,700
Not in the mood?

262
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,550
Mood's a thing for cattle and love play.

263
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:13,700
Not fighting!

264
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,300
I'm sorry, Gurney.

265
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,900
Not sorry enough.

266
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,750
<i>What's wrong with Gurney?</i>

267
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,300
<i>He's not faking this.</i>

268
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,200
Now, guard yourself for true!

269
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,900
Is this what you seek?

270
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,100
Good!

271
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,600
The slow blade penetrates the shield.

272
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,800
But... look down.

273
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:10,100
We'd have joined each other in death.

274
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:14,050
You did seem finally to get in the mood.

275
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,700
Would you really have drawn my blood?

276
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,650
If you'd have fought one whit
below your abilities,

277
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,700
I'd have given you a good scar
to remind you.

278
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,750
Things have been so serious here lately.

279
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,950
Soon we'll leave for Arrakis.

280
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,450
Arrakis is real.

281
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,350
The Harkonnens are real.

282
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,950
Doctor Yueh,

283
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,300
do you have any information
on the worms of Arrakis?

284
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,450
I've obtained a filmbook
of a small specimen.

285
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,050
Only 125 meters long.

286
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,350
Only?

287
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,650
There have been documented
sightings of worms

288
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:06,100
as large as 450 meters
in the deep desert.

289
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:09,700
That's far from where we'll be in Arrakeen.

290
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:15,000
The desert belt and the south polar
region are marked forbidden.

291
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,200
The storms and the worms.

292
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:24,100
Is it true that the sand can blow
at 700 km per hour?

293
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:28,000
It can render flesh into dust in minutes.

294
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,550
And these dry winds can also generate

295
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:35,150
tremendous amounts of static
electricity in the atmosphere.

296
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,350
Our body shields won't have enough power

297
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,750
to operate in the open air on Arrakis.

298
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,350
How do the Fremen survive there?

299
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,350
We don't know much about the Fremen.

300
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,000
They live in the deep desert,
some of them in the cities.

301
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,300
They have blue-within-blue eyes.

302
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,050
Oh, the eyes!

303
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,700
Yes.

304
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,300
Saturation of the blood
by the spice melange.

305
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,200
Could the spice affect us in other ways?

306
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,500
Many dangers exist on Arrakis.

307
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,600
For one,

308
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,200
the Harkonnens would not have given up

309
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,300
their CHOAM Company contract so easily.

310
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,350
The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes.

311
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,050
But behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor.

312
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,900
You'll make a formidable Duke.

313
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,450
Now, remember,

314
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:32,500
the first step in avoiding a trap

315
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,000
is knowing of its existence.

316
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,800
I know. But if it is a trap,

317
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,550
then why are we going?

318
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,250
We have our new army.

319
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,550
Doctor Yueh,

320
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:46,050
put the weirding module on him.

321
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,300
Well...

322
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,300
Clear and lock the room.

323
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,450
Detachment, stand down.

324
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,400
Activate a fighter.

325
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,300
Make the range 2 meters.

326
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,500
Precise control.

327
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,650
It's not Duncan's style.

328
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,450
Nor mine.

329
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,500
That's his mother's influence.

330
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,400
<i>Another member of the Duke's
household is Duncan Idaho,</i>

331
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,450
<i>friend and swordmaster to Paul Atreides.</i>

332
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,700
Duncan!

333
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:26,850
Paul, I was just on my way
to say goodbye to you.

334
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,150
I have to go on ahead, alone,

335
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,700
I won't be seeing you for a while.

336
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,050
I wish you were coming with us. Why?

337
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,750
It's something for your father.

338
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,550
He wants to talk to you.

339
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,400
I'll see you on Arrakis.

340
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,650
May the hand of God be with you.

341
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,250
May the hand of God be with us all, Duncan.

342
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,700
Father.

343
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Thank you for joining me, Paul.

344
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,450
It'll be good to get to our new home

345
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,300
and have all this upset behind us.

346
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,300
Thufir Hawat has served House
Atreides three generations.

347
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,750
He swears you are the finest
student he has ever taught.

348
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,500
Yueh, Gurney, and Duncan say the same.

349
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,800
Makes me feel very proud.

350
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,600
I want you to be proud of me.

351
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,050
I'll miss the sea.

352
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,250
But a person needs new experiences.

353
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,000
They jar something deep inside,

354
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,200
allowing him to grow.

355
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,300
Without change,

356
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,650
something sleeps inside us

357
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,600
and seldom awakens.

358
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:42,050
The sleeper must awaken.

359
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,150
Arrakis. Dune.

360
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,650
Desert Planet.

361
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,400
<i>I will kill you.</i>

362
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,150
The second moon.

363
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,900
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

364
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,900
<i>I know she has come to test him.</i>

365
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,700
<i>No man has ever been tested with the box.</i>

366
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:56,550
<i>Tonight, I may lose my son.</i>

367
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:24,900
Jessica, you were told to bear
only daughters to the Atreides.

368
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,700
Jessica!

369
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,550
It meant so much to him.

370
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,650
You thought only of
a Duke's desire for a son?

371
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,300
Desires don't come into this.

372
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,900
An Atreides daughter could have been wed

373
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,700
to a Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach.

374
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,800
We may lose both bloodlines now.

375
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,200
I vowed never to regret my decision.

376
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,150
I'll pay for all my own mistakes.

377
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,650
And your son will pay with you.

378
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,500
Is Arrakis...

379
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,300
Is it really so terrible on Arrakis?

380
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,200
My Duke...

381
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:19,500
You entered into this with full knowledge
of the delicate edge you walked.

382
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,100
Jessica.

383
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,300
I wish I could stand in your place

384
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,300
and take your sufferings.

385
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,150
But we must each of us take our own path.

386
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,200
I know.

387
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,750
I understand.

388
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,700
About Paul...

389
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,700
What you did and why you did it,
we both know.

390
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,600
But kindness forces me to tell you

391
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,200
there is little chance you will
be the Bene Gesserit totality.

392
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:04,450
However, I will observe him.

393
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,700
In a few minutes, Jessica,

394
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,450
your son will be proved
to be a living human being,

395
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:13,050
or he will be a dead animal.

396
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,200
He's here.

397
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,450
Arrakis. Dune,

398
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,450
Desert Planet.

399
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,650
Moving.

400
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,150
Moving.

401
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,100
We'll salvage what we can.

402
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,650
But I can tell you, dear God,

403
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,500
for the father, nothing.

404
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,050
<i>For the father, nothing?</i>

405
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:06,550
Did you really think you could
bear the Kwisatz Haderach?

406
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:09,050
The Universe's super being?

407
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,750
How dare you!

408
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,700
My greatest student.

409
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:18,950
And my greatest disappointment.

410
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,800
He's awake. He's listening to us.

411
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,050
Good! Ready yourself, young Paul Atreides.

412
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:32,950
I want to see you in your mother's
chambers in one-quarter of an hour.

413
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,150
Paul...

414
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:40,450
This is very important.

415
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,250
Remember you are a duke's son.

416
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,900
<i>Kwisatz Haderach? The super being?</i>

417
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,300
<i>For the father, nothing?</i>

418
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:13,150
This is the Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam.

419
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:17,250
She's going to observe you.

420
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,200
Please.

421
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,300
Jessica,

422
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,100
you know it must be done.

423
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,850
Your Reverence.

424
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,200
<i>What does she fear?</i>

425
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,800
What about my father?

426
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,100
Paul,

427
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,850
listen to the Reverend Mother
and do what she tells you.

428
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:50,050
Now, you,

429
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,250
come here.

430
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,100
<i>She's using the Voice.</i>

431
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,450
No.

432
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,800
<i>Some strength there.</i>

433
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,300
<i>Surprising.</i>

434
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,750
Come here!

435
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,900
<i>Come here!</i>

436
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,200
<i>Come here!</i>

437
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,550
Do you see this?

438
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,900
Put your right hand in the box.

439
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,900
What's in the box?

440
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,200
Pain.

441
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,600
Stop!

442
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,300
Put your hand in the box.

443
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,700
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar.

444
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,700
Don't pull away or you'll feel the poison.

445
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:56,150
A duke's son must know
about many poisons.

446
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,650
This one kills only animals.

447
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,950
Are you suggesting
a Duke's son is an animal?

448
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,150
Let us say,

449
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,600
I suggest you may be human.

450
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,800
Your awareness may be powerful
enough to control your instincts.

451
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,800
Your instinct will be

452
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,250
to remove your hand from the box.

453
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,450
If you do so,

454
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,050
you die.

455
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,050
You will feel

456
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:28,600
an itching

457
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,500
there.

458
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:38,650
Now the itching becomes burning.

459
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,700
Heat upon heat upon heat.

460
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,950
- It burns.
- Silence, silence!

461
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:49,400
<i>I must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.</i>

462
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:53,050
<i>And fear is the little death
that brings total obliteration.</i>

463
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,000
<i>I will face my fear.</i>

464
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:58,000
<i>I will permit it to pass
over me and through me.</i>

465
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,250
<i>I must not fear.</i>

466
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:02,150
- You feel the flesh crisping.
- <i>Fear is the mind killer.</i>

467
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:05,450
<i>Fear is the little death that
brings total obliteration.</i>

468
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,200
<i>I will face my fear.</i>

469
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,500
Flesh dropping off.

470
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,750
<i>Fear is the little death.</i>

471
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,200
<i>I must not fear.</i>

472
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,000
<i>Fear is the little death.</i>

473
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,300
I'm...</i>

474
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,600
The pain!

475
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,100
No! Enough!

476
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,000
Kull Wahad!

477
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,950
No woman child ever withstood that much.

478
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:40,550
Take your hand out of the box
and look at it, young human.

479
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,800
Do it!

480
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,100
Pain by nerve induction.

481
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:55,250
A human can resist any pain.

482
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:58,400
Our test is crisis and observation.

483
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,450
I see the truth of it.

484
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,250
<i>Could he be the one?</i>

485
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,900
<i>Maybe.</i>

486
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,200
<i>But will he be ours to control?</i>

487
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,800
You know when people speak the truth?

488
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,300
I know it.

489
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,000
Your mother wants you
to tell me about your dreams.

490
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,250
I only want to know one thing.

491
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,850
Do they come true?

492
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,100
Not all of them.

493
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,050
I know which ones will.

494
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:48,200
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.

495
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,250
What is that?

496
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,250
The person who can be
many places at once.

497
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,600
The one who bridges time and space.

498
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,900
He will look where we cannot.

499
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:06,050
Do you know of the Water of Life?

500
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:09,000
The bile from the newborn worms of Arrakis?

501
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,200
I have heard of it.

502
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,650
It is very dangerous.

503
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,750
The Bene Gesserit sisterhood
use it to see within.

504
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,800
There is a place

505
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,250
terrifying to us,

506
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,950
to women.

507
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,100
It is said

508
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,400
a man will come.

509
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,100
The Kwisatz Haderach.

510
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,750
He will go where we cannot.

511
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:40,200
Many men have tried.

512
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:43,000
They tried and failed?

513
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,250
They tried and died.

514
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,150
Jessica.

515
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:56,000
<i>My son lives!</i>

516
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,350
I sense your teachings in him.

517
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,450
Ignore the regular order of training.

518
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,750
His safety requires the Voice.

519
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,100
I've heard enough of my safety.

520
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,800
What about my father?

521
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,950
I heard your talking.

522
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,250
You speak as if he were dead.
Well, he's not!

523
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,700
- Paul!
- But he's not!

524
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,350
And he won't die. Tell me he won't die.

525
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:24,050
What can be done has been done.

526
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,850
Mother, tell me!

527
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,600
The Voice could save you.

528
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
<i>The Baron Harkonnen sent
Duke Leto a gesture of peace.</i>

529
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:08,300
<i>No way would the Duke
forego the art of Kanly,</i>

530
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,000
<i>as vendetta was known.</i>

531
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:15,300
<i>This then, is the Duke's response
as he sat writing at his desk...</i>

532
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,250
<i>"Your offer of a meeting is refused.</i>

533
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:21,350
<i>"I have ofttimes met your treachery,
and this all men know.</i>

534
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,450
<i>"The art of Kanly still has
its admirers in the empire."</i>

535
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:29,550
<i>Then he signed it, "Duke Leto of Arrakis",</i>

536
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:32,800
<i>knowing full well that
this would annoy the Baron.</i>

537
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:36,150
<i>With his ducal signet ring,</i>

538
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:40,100
<i>the Duke put the seal of the House
of Atreides under his signature,</i>

539
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,350
<i>"Duke Leto of Arrakis."</i>

540
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,250
Vas!

541
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,500
<i>Soon the Baron would have his answer.</i>

542
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,600
<i>Among those who serve
the Baron is Piter De Vries,</i>

543
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,200
<i>Mentat Master of Assassins.</i>

544
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,550
<i>Mentat Piter De Vries.</i>

545
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:25,700
<i>Message for Mentat Piter De Vries.</i>

546
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,550
<i>The Baron is impatient for Leto's reply.</i>

547
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:37,350
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.

548
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:40,050
It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,

549
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:42,550
that lips acquire stains,
that stains become a warning.

550
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:45,200
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.

551
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:50,550
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.

552
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:53,200
It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,

553
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,700
that lips acquire stains,
that stains become a warning.

554
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,850
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.

555
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,050
My lord.

556
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,100
Piter!

557
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,800
The Atreides will be leaving
Caladan soon, Baron,

558
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:02,100
and I have here your answer
from Duke Leto.

559
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,450
What does Leto say, Piter?

560
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:07,050
He wishes to inform you that vendetta,

561
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:09,950
as he puts it, using the ancient tongue,

562
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,050
the art of Kanly, is still alive.

563
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:16,650
He does not wish to
meet or speak with you.

564
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,750
I've made my peace gesture.

565
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,500
The forms of Kanly have been obeyed!

566
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,800
Bring in Feyd and Rabban.

567
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,800
As you instructed me,

568
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,000
I have enlightened your nephews

569
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,400
concerning my plan--

570
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:01,900
My plan!

571
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,250
The plan to crush the Atreides.

572
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,000
Feyd...

573
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:12,350
Rabban...

574
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:15,400
Go quietly.

575
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,950
No other great house of the Landsraad

576
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:23,950
must ever know of the
Emperor's aid to the Baron.

577
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:28,950
The entire Landsraad
would turn against the Baron

578
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,900
and the Emperor.

579
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,100
I will have Arrakis back for myself!

580
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,700
He who controls the spice,
controls the Universe!

581
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,250
And what Piter did not tell you

582
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:44,750
is we have control of someone
who is very close,

583
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:47,500
very close to Duke Leto.

584
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:50,450
This person, this traitor,

585
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:54,350
will be worth more to us
than 10 legions of Sardaukar.

586
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:56,550
And who is this traitor?

587
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:00,000
I won't tell you who the traitor is,

588
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,850
or when we'll attack.

589
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,750
However,

590
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,400
the Duke will die before
these eyes and he'll know,

591
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,050
he'll know that it is I,

592
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:14,100
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen,
who encompasses his doom!

593
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:07,350
I once told you a daughter would
be conceived at a time of parting.

594
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,900
I remember.

595
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:18,200
Conceived in love at a time of parting.

596
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:31,600
Arrakis is a hostile world though.

597
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:36,850
I must be sure you want this.

598
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:42,950
It has to be tonight

599
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:48,350
under these influences.

600
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:02,000
I could hear you with the wind.

601
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,300
And I whispered yes.

602
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,350
And I whispered...

603
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,150
"I love you."

604
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,750
Soon they will begin to fold space.

605
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:11,800
<i>Far off in the control rooms
of the spice gas.</i>

606
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,500
<i>Traveling without moving.</i>

607
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:27,150
And now,

608
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,100
the prophecy.

609
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,050
One will come.

610
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:37,250
The voice from the outer world.

611
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,400
Bringing the Holy War,

612
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:42,700
the Jihad.

613
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:45,800
Which will cleanse the Universe

614
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:49,700
and bring us out of darkness.

615
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:07,650
<i>Hidden away within the rocks
of these deserts on Arrakis</i>

616
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:10,350
<i>are a people known as the Fremen.</i>

617
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:13,000
<i>These people, the Fremen,</i>

618
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,900
<i>have long held a prophecy
that a super being</i>

619
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,000
<i>a male child of a Bene Gesserit</i>

620
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,750
<i>with great mental powers and courage,</i>

621
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:23,750
<i>the Kwisatz Haderach,</i>

622
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:26,600
<i>will come and lead them to true freedom.</i>

623
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,200
Mother and the son.

624
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:03,600
<i>House Atreides took control of Arrakis,</i>

625
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:08,800
<i>63 standard days into the year 10191.</i>

626
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:12,250
<i>It was known that the Harkonnens,</i>

627
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:14,500
<i>the former rulers of Arrakis</i>

628
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,650
<i>would leave many suicide troops behind.</i>

629
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,700
<i>Atreides' patrols were doubled.</i>

630
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:34,350
Duncan!

631
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:41,750
The Fremen have sent
a message to you, Sire.

632
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:49,650
Have you read this?

633
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:52,250
No, I was instructed it was for you.

634
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,400
It says...

635
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,050
"A column of smoke by day,

636
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,150
"a pillar of fire by night."

637
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,200
A warning.

638
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,600
An obscure one, at best.

639
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,000
What have you discovered
about the Fremen, Duncan?

640
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,100
Tell me.

641
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:15,200
Why haven't we heard from you?

642
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,050
My lord, I suspect so much.

643
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:22,200
I think they are the allies we seek.

644
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:24,150
They are strong, fierce.

645
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,300
They do not give their loyalty
easily or quickly.

646
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:28,950
As you know,

647
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:32,300
the Imperium has never been able
to take a census of the Fremen.

648
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,650
Everyone thinks that there are but few
wandering here and there in the desert.

649
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,400
My lord,

650
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,450
I suspect an incredible secret
has been kept on this planet.

651
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:46,100
That the Fremen exist in vast numbers.

652
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,450
Vast!

653
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:53,250
And it is they who control Arrakis.

654
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:04,300
<i>Each trooper will be charged
with responsibility for preserving water.</i>

655
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:09,600
<i>Our existence as an operating army depends
on these following water-saving procedures.</i>

656
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:12,400
<i>Remember, water is life.</i>

657
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:19,400
Why is the shield not yet up?

658
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:23,200
Sir, we found and removed
another sabotage device.

659
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:24,950
I think it'll go up now, sir.

660
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:32,900
They're finding these
sabotage devices too easily.

661
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,400
<i>House shield activating.</i>

662
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:29,050
My lady, the local people,

663
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:32,000
the maids and servants,
await your inspection.

664
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:34,350
Hawat has cleared them.

665
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:39,150
Excuse me, my lady.

666
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:44,250
The Harkonnens may have
tampered with them medically.

667
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:55,550
When you said Harkonnens,

668
00:59:57,150 --> 00:59:59,900
I didn't know you had so
much reason to hate them.

669
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,250
Well, my wife...

670
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:10,200
But, of course, you didn't know my wife.

671
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:13,900
The Har...

672
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,500
Forgive me.

673
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:18,100
<i>They must have killed her.</i>

674
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:21,550
Please excuse me if I can't talk about it.

675
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,100
<i>He's holding something back.</i>

676
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:33,500
<i>Yet, there's the Imperial conditioning.</i>

677
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:37,150
<i>Assurance of trust.</i>

678
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:47,300
<i>The Bene Gesserit mother, the legend.</i>

679
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,900
<i>Where is your son?</i>

680
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:54,450
<i>I must warn you. You are in great danger.</i>

681
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,650
<i>My message, it's here.</i>

682
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:21,600
There are more enemy bodies coming in
for your inspection, Doctor Yueh.

683
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,550
Are you all right?

684
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:29,150
Yes, I'm fine.

685
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:31,300
Thank you, Thufir.

686
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:40,600
<i>One carryall handles
four spice mining teams.</i>

687
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,500
<i>However, it will fly only
two harvesters at a time.</i>

688
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:48,200
<i>Today, we have 930 harvesters</i>

689
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:51,050
<i>and 981 carryalls.</i>

690
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,400
<i>Safe.</i>

691
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,700
<i>Spice.</i>

692
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:09,050
<i>The second moon.</i>

693
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:13,000
<i>The sleeper must awaken.</i>

694
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,400
<i>Am I the one?</i>

695
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:31,350
<i>A hunter-seeker!</i>

696
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,550
<i>It can't get me if I don't move.</i>

697
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:37,250
<i>It's too dark in here for it to see clearly.</i>

698
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:56,000
<i>I've got to try to grab it.</i>

699
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:59,600
<i>The suspensor field will make it
slippery on the bottom.</i>

700
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,700
<i>I must grip it tightly.</i>

701
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:06,050
<i>Who is operating that thing?</i>

702
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:09,200
<i>It has to be someone in the palace.</i>

703
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:11,500
<i>I could shout for help,</i>

704
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,050
<i>but it would kill whoever opened the door.</i>

705
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,150
<i>Hold still.</i>

706
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:00,200
It would have killed me.

707
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:04,700
I was its target. It went to the motion.

708
01:06:05,550 --> 01:06:07,050
Who are you?

709
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:09,200
I am the Shadout Mapes,

710
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:11,850
the housekeeper.

711
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,800
I must cleanse the way between us.

712
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:18,150
You saved my life,

713
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,650
and we Fremen pay our debts.

714
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,100
<i>A Fremen.</i>

715
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:26,450
It is known to us that
you've a traitor in your midst.

716
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,200
Who it is,we cannot say.

717
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:31,900
But we are certain of it.

718
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:43,350
A traitor.

719
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:58,000
Set up a sonar probe immediately.

720
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:16,550
Thufir!

721
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:19,600
Did you find anything?

722
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,200
<i>Nothing yet.</i>

723
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:23,150
Keep looking.

724
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:27,950
<i>And the traitor? God help us.</i>

725
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:33,600
My lord...

726
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:38,000
Again, my lord, I wish to
tender my resignation.

727
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,050
Silence, Thufir. Stop acting the fool.

728
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:41,900
I told you yesterday!

729
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,600
If you made a mistake,

730
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,900
it wasn't overestimating the Harkonnens.

731
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:49,250
Their simple minds came up
with a simple trick.

732
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:54,600
Paul survived this largely
because of your training.

733
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,450
You didn't fare bad.

734
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:58,450
Sit down, Thufir.

735
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:01,150
My lord.

736
01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:09,450
Thufir,

737
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,800
where is this traitor?

738
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:16,200
I know you've cleared everyone,

739
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,450
especially those close to us.

740
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,650
But recheck and find him.

741
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,350
<i>They have tried to take the life of my son.</i>

742
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:34,450
Sector 6 through 80 progress reports, Sire.

743
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:36,150
Take it, Thufir.

744
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:42,300
Sector 680, copy the 6th, the
summit, the 8th, quadrant over

745
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,700
the 9th plus 84 circles, weave
the 80 and call the 4th. Copy.

746
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:54,550
8. Thufir Tawat, Mentat,
Master of assassins.

747
01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:00,700
The palace is now secure.

748
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:05,050
The city of Arrakeen is under martial law.

749
01:09:05,650 --> 01:09:09,300
We have troops here
headquartered underground

750
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,700
on sub-floors 6 through 10.

751
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:14,300
The rest of the troops
are stationed in Arrakeen

752
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,700
and we have some on the airfield.

753
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,150
Our new army is still in training,

754
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:21,900
but everything, everything is shielded.

755
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,150
And with this shielding
we are impenetrable.

756
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:28,850
Kyn...

757
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:30,650
Kynes...

758
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,700
Dr. Kynes is waiting.

759
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:36,500
He is the Emperor's Judge of the Change

760
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,350
monitoring the evacuation
of the Harkonnens

761
01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:41,650
and our taking control.

762
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:46,050
He plans on taking you

763
01:09:46,150 --> 01:09:49,400
on an inspection
of the spice mining operation.

764
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:53,900
Now, he may or may not

765
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,300
be sympathetic to our cause.

766
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,100
But, Sire,

767
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:01,850
with the attempt on the young master,

768
01:10:01,950 --> 01:10:05,800
I am against your leaving the palace.

769
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:07,800
The attempt failed.

770
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:10,800
Harkonnen captives
have already been taken.

771
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:14,300
We must crush the Harkonnen
machine on Arrakis.

772
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:17,650
You all know what to do!

773
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:29,900
Gurney, we desperately
need more spice miners.

774
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:32,600
Many are threatening to leave
on the next shuttle.

775
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:35,350
We need spice drivers,
weather scanners, dunemen.

776
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:37,550
Any with open sand experience.

777
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,250
You must persuade them to enlist with us.

778
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:49,600
"They shall come all for violence."

779
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:54,200
"Their faces shall sup up as the east wind."

780
01:10:56,550 --> 01:11:00,300
"And they will gather
the captivity of the sand."

781
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,300
Very moving, Gurney.

782
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:06,450
On your way.

783
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:15,000
And take care of Doctor Kynes
until Paul and I arrive.

784
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:19,600
We will not be prisoners here in this place.

785
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:24,550
Behold, as a wild ass in the desert
go I forth to my work.

786
01:11:41,150 --> 01:11:42,450
Yes?

787
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,850
I am the Shadout Mapes.

788
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,650
Your housekeeper, noble-born.

789
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,700
What are your orders?

790
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,800
You may refer to me as "my lady".

791
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,850
I'm not noble-born.

792
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:04,200
I'm the bound concubine of Duke Leto,

793
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:07,050
mother of the heir designate.

794
01:12:07,450 --> 01:12:08,900
"Shadout".

795
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:12,350
That's an ancient word.

796
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,850
You know the ancient tongues?

797
01:12:15,950 --> 01:12:18,350
I know many things.

798
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:22,300
I know you came prepared for violence

799
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:25,100
with a weapon in your bodice.

800
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,250
My lady,

801
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:31,700
the weapon was sent as a gift,

802
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:34,000
if you should prove to be the one.

803
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,150
And the means of my death

804
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
should I prove otherwise.

805
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:48,450
My lady,

806
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,650
when one has lived with prophecy
for so long,

807
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:58,350
the moment of revelation is a shock.

808
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,700
<i>Duke Leto is now here.</i>

809
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:08,400
<i>Spice mining inspection
to start immediately.</i>

810
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:28,450
So, you are Doctor Kynes.

811
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:30,400
The Judge of the Change.

812
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,750
And the Imperial Ecologist, Sire.

813
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:34,700
Our intelligence informs us

814
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,400
that there's still a strong
Harkonnen presence.

815
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,750
The process of removal continues.

816
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:42,300
This is my son, Paul.

817
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:45,000
Are you a Fremen?

818
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:46,350
I've been on Arrakis

819
01:13:46,450 --> 01:13:49,550
in the service of the Emperor
long enough for my eyes to change.

820
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:51,700
<i>In the service of the Emperor.</i>

821
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,650
We are in your hands, Doctor.

822
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:56,300
Your gift of the stillsuits
is much appreciated.

823
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,250
Would you give us an explanation
of their workings?

824
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:02,800
Well, this is a stillsuit
of Fremen manufacture,

825
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:05,050
the most efficient type on Arrakis.

826
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:06,450
Basically...

827
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,550
It's all right, Gurney.

828
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:14,300
Yes, Sire.

829
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:18,650
Basically, it's a high-efficiency filter

830
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:21,000
and heat exchange system.

831
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,400
Perspiration passes through the first layer

832
01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:26,750
and is gathered in the second,

833
01:14:26,850 --> 01:14:28,750
where salt is separated.

834
01:14:29,150 --> 01:14:32,600
Breathing and walking
provide the pumping action.

835
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:36,850
The reclaimed water
circulates to catch pockets,

836
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:39,950
from which you can drink through this tube

837
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,650
around your neck.

838
01:14:42,450 --> 01:14:45,500
Urine and feces are processed
in the thigh pads.

839
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:49,000
Should you be in the open desert,

840
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:52,050
remember to breathe
in through your mouth

841
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,600
and out through this nose tube.

842
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:57,350
With a Fremen suit in
good working condition,

843
01:14:57,450 --> 01:14:59,550
life can be sustained for weeks,

844
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:02,800
even in the deep desert, Sire.

845
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:05,800
My thanks.

846
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:07,850
With your permission.

847
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:12,050
You've worn a stillsuit before.

848
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:13,550
No.

849
01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:16,250
Your suit is fitted desert fashion.

850
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,300
Who told you how to do that?

851
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:20,200
No one.

852
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,800
It seemed the proper way.

853
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,400
That it is.

854
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,200
<i>He shall know your ways
as if born to them.</i>

855
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:34,900
We're wasting time, Sire.

856
01:16:05,950 --> 01:16:07,900
<i>Air speed, 0-5.</i>

857
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:12,050
<i>Ambient temperature,
300 degrees Kelvin.</i>

858
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:15,100
<i>Air speed, 2-0.</i>

859
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:21,850
<i>Ether bender, 75% efficiency.</i>

860
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:31,500
That's where I told your sandmaster
to concentrate the harvesting today.

861
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:34,900
Southeast, over the Shield Wall.

862
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:40,600
<i>Ambient temperature,
350 degrees Kelvin.</i>

863
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:44,000
<i>Air speed, 1-3-0.</i>

864
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:48,150
<i>Caution. You've now cleared</i>

865
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:51,050
<i>protective Shield Wall
and entered open desert.</i>

866
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,500
Will we see a worm?

867
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:06,600
Where there is spice and spice mining,
there are always worms.

868
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:08,800
- Always?
- Always.

869
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,100
Why do they come?

870
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:14,100
To protect their territory.

871
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:16,300
Vibrations attract them.

872
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,600
<i>He must be a Fremen or in with them.</i>

873
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,250
<i>He's studying us.</i>

874
01:17:22,350 --> 01:17:24,950
<i>He's hiding something about the spice.</i>

875
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:28,750
Is there a relationship between
the worms and the spice?

876
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:34,250
As I said, they defend the spice sands.

877
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:38,600
As to their relationship with the spice,

878
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:41,100
who knows?

879
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,050
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.

880
01:17:46,150 --> 01:17:48,000
That's it. Spice mining.

881
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:51,050
No other cloud quite like it.

882
01:17:53,650 --> 01:17:55,450
See the spotters over it?

883
01:17:55,550 --> 01:17:57,150
They're watching for wormsign,

884
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:59,000
the telltale sand waves.

885
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:02,650
Seismic probes on the surface, too, Sire.

886
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:07,650
Worms can travel too deep
for their waves to show.

887
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:11,100
Looks like a good patch of spice.

888
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:14,100
Wormsign?

889
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,000
Is it wormsign?

890
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:18,100
Yes. Worm. Big one.

891
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:21,100
You've got sharp eyes. May I?

892
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:27,450
Calling Harvester Pad 9. Wormsign.

893
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:29,550
<i>Who calls Pad 9?</i>

894
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:30,850
Don't mention the Duke.

895
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:32,950
This is an un-coded channel.

896
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,350
Unlisted flight northeast of you.

897
01:18:35,450 --> 01:18:37,650
Wormsign on intercept course.

898
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,400
Estimated contact, 15 minutes.

899
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,200
<i>Have sighting confirmed.
Stand by for a fix.</i>

900
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:46,100
<i>Contact in 16 minutes minus.</i>

901
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:47,700
<i>Very precise estimate.</i>

902
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,400
<i>Who's on that unlisted flight?</i>

903
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:53,400
What happens now?

904
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:56,800
The carryall will come
and lift off the spice harvester.

905
01:18:58,350 --> 01:19:00,200
Try to get in close over the harvester.

906
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,850
You'll find this interesting, Sire.

907
01:19:03,150 --> 01:19:05,400
They work until the very last minute.

908
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:08,050
Spotter control, there's
no sign of the carryall.

909
01:19:08,150 --> 01:19:10,100
It isn't answering.

910
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:13,000
The worm is 8 minutes away, Sire.

911
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:15,600
<i>Spotter control, give me
a report by the numbers.</i>

912
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,900
<i>- Report 1.
- No contact.</i>

913
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
- <i>Report 2.
- Negative.</i>

914
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:22,200
- <i>Report 3.
- Negative, Sire.</i>

915
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:25,850
<i>- Report 4.
- No contact. Repeat, no contact.</i>

916
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:28,200
I think they've got our carryall.

917
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:30,300
Damn it! Harkonnens.

918
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:32,850
We're coming down to
take you off the harvester.

919
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:34,950
All spotters are ordered to comply.

920
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:36,350
Ordered by whom?

921
01:19:36,450 --> 01:19:37,750
Duke Leto Atreides.

922
01:19:38,050 --> 01:19:40,050
<i>Yes. Yes, Sire.</i>

923
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:41,500
How many men do you have?

924
01:19:41,650 --> 01:19:43,000
<i>Full crew, 26 men.</i>

925
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:45,400
But, Sire, we can't leave all this spice.

926
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:46,850
Damn the spice!

927
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:48,300
Get out of there!

928
01:19:57,950 --> 01:19:59,700
Two men in each of the spotters!

929
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:01,600
You, over here!

930
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:02,900
Run!

931
01:20:03,550 --> 01:20:04,500
Run!

932
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,700
I can't see him yet, but he is very close now.

933
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:16,950
Damn sloppy! Really damn sloppy!

934
01:20:17,050 --> 01:20:18,900
Come on, boys. Come on!

935
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:24,800
We're going to be heavy, Sire.

936
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:26,500
<i>Spice.</i>

937
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:30,850
<i>Pure unrefined spice.</i>

938
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:39,450
Here he is! We've got to go!

939
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:50,950
Bless the Maker and his water.

940
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:52,800
Bless the coming and going of Him.

941
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:54,800
May His passing cleanse the world.

942
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:56,800
What's that you're saying?

943
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:58,100
Nothing.

944
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,500
Gods, what a monster!

945
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:48,450
Someone is going to pay for this, I promise.

946
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:54,900
<i>He's more concerned
over his men than the spice.</i>

947
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:59,200
<i>I must admit,
against all better judgment,</i>

948
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:01,600
<i>I like this Duke.</i>

949
01:22:57,150 --> 01:22:58,850
Dr. Kynes,

950
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,700
being in the employ of the Emperor,
as you are,

951
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:08,400
perhaps it isn't wise for you to
associate too closely with us Atreides.

952
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,200
On the contrary,

953
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:14,600
I feel very comfortable here.

954
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,350
Remember how precious water is here.

955
01:23:20,450 --> 01:23:22,500
It was a token of respect.

956
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:27,650
Are you enlisting with us?

957
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:30,700
You see through to the truth of the thing, Sire.

958
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:32,800
That means a dual alliance.

959
01:23:32,950 --> 01:23:34,500
He's in with the Emperor.

960
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:38,450
A dual alliance, yes.

961
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:41,250
But not with the Emperor.

962
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,200
The Fremen.

963
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:51,200
Then let water be a bond between us.

964
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:40,700
<i>Duke Leto's signet ring</i>

965
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,600
<i>has come to represent
power and good fortune</i>

966
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:46,950
<i>to Baron Vladimir Harkonnen
and many others.</i>

967
01:24:47,150 --> 01:24:50,650
<i>The Baron has sworn to destroy
the House of Atreides</i>

968
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:53,950
<i>and steal the ducal ring for himself.</i>

969
01:25:01,950 --> 01:25:04,550
Sorry you have to sleep so far underground,

970
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:08,650
but we can't take any chances.

971
01:25:10,650 --> 01:25:12,500
I see you're studying.

972
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:14,750
Knowledge is strength.

973
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:19,250
Yes, so said Thufir Hawat.

974
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:24,350
One must have more than that to hold
Arrakis against our many enemies.

975
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,400
Much more.

976
01:25:30,850 --> 01:25:31,900
Much...

977
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:34,300
more.

978
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,500
Paul...

979
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:54,100
If anything should happen to me...

980
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:57,300
Father, nothing's going to happen.

981
01:25:57,650 --> 01:25:58,750
Yes.

982
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,850
But if it should...

983
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:04,450
Yes?

984
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:06,500
Unknown objects on screen.

985
01:26:06,650 --> 01:26:08,600
We are attempting to identify.

986
01:26:15,150 --> 01:26:16,650
I'll be back, son.

987
01:27:04,650 --> 01:27:06,950
Sleep well, my son.

988
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:21,050
Father...

989
01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:23,550
drugged.

990
01:27:29,950 --> 01:27:32,450
<i>Jessica, what is wrong?</i>

991
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:35,400
<i>Forgive me, my beloved concubine.</i>

992
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:38,500
<i>I should have married you.</i>

993
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:44,000
<i>Why hold a dream to ascend to the
throne through a political marriage?</i>

994
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:47,950
<i>I should have married you.</i>

995
01:28:13,050 --> 01:28:14,400
What happened?

996
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:37,750
Yueh!

997
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:40,000
<i>He sabotaged the house generators.</i>

998
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:42,100
<i>We are wide open!</i>

999
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:44,700
<i>House shield deactivating.</i>

1000
01:28:45,150 --> 01:28:48,200
I've destroyed the new army's
weirding modules.

1001
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:50,650
I've brought House Atreides down.

1002
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:52,000
Why?

1003
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:53,900
I wish to kill a man.

1004
01:28:54,550 --> 01:28:56,450
Not you, my dear duke.

1005
01:28:56,650 --> 01:28:58,550
You were already dead.

1006
01:28:58,650 --> 01:29:01,450
But you'll get close to the Baron
before you die.

1007
01:29:01,550 --> 01:29:04,750
You'll be tied and drugged,
but you can still attack.

1008
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:07,300
You can still attack!

1009
01:29:08,350 --> 01:29:10,200
When you see the Baron,

1010
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:13,250
you'll have a new poison gas tooth.

1011
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,950
He'll want you close,
so he can gloat over you.

1012
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:23,500
One bite on this tooth
and a strong exhale...

1013
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:27,200
- Refuse.
- No, you mustn't!

1014
01:29:27,950 --> 01:29:32,500
Because, in return, I'll save
the lives of your Paul and Jessica.

1015
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:39,750
For Paul.

1016
01:29:54,850 --> 01:29:57,850
When you see the Baron,
remember the tooth.

1017
01:29:58,550 --> 01:30:00,000
The tooth!

1018
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:02,000
The tooth!

1019
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:14,000
The weirding modules, destroyed!

1020
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:24,400
<i>Attention!</i>

1021
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:28,250
<i>We are approaching target area.</i>

1022
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:30,150
<i>The bomb scopes are set.</i>

1023
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:35,000
The shield is down!

1024
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:38,950
Open the doors!

1025
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,200
Signals!

1026
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:44,900
Get that shield up!

1027
01:30:45,050 --> 01:30:46,500
The shield!

1028
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:49,850
<i>Man the planes.</i>

1029
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:57,050
<i>Release the bombs.</i>

1030
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:53,800
Long live Duke Leto!

1031
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,200
The drug was timed.

1032
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:56,900
Dr. Yueh has been very valuable to us.

1033
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:02,600
What a pity you must remain gagged.

1034
01:33:03,850 --> 01:33:06,050
We can't let ourselves be swayed

1035
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:08,400
by your witch's voice, now, can we?

1036
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:12,000
<i>Leto, where are you?</i>

1037
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:15,150
Bring him here!

1038
01:33:20,450 --> 01:33:22,400
You've done a very good job.

1039
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:24,850
He hardly feels a thing.

1040
01:34:01,850 --> 01:34:03,400
Open your mouth.

1041
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:07,100
Open it. Open it!

1042
01:34:11,950 --> 01:34:14,850
You've done a good job, traitor.

1043
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,750
They are alike, this mother and son.

1044
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:29,250
<i>Paul!</i>

1045
01:34:31,350 --> 01:34:32,800
Dangerous.

1046
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:39,800
The training they have had

1047
01:34:40,450 --> 01:34:43,050
beyond most people's imaginations.

1048
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:47,800
<i>Get up.</i>

1049
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:50,650
I leave them in your hands, Piter.

1050
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:59,450
Goodbye, Jessica.

1051
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:02,550
And goodbye to your sweet son.

1052
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:10,200
We were ordered to kill them. So, kill them!

1053
01:35:26,050 --> 01:35:28,550
What are your orders, Piter?

1054
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:32,050
Take them to the desert,
as the traitor suggested.

1055
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
The worms will destroy the evidence.

1056
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:37,900
Their bodies must never be found.

1057
01:36:08,050 --> 01:36:10,500
I knew Yueh's wife.

1058
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:16,500
I was the one who broke
his Imperial conditioning.

1059
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:23,650
I've thought of many pleasures with you.

1060
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:28,350
It is perhaps better that you die

1061
01:36:28,450 --> 01:36:30,750
in the innards of a worm.

1062
01:36:31,050 --> 01:36:33,800
Desire clouds my reason.

1063
01:36:35,150 --> 01:36:36,750
That is not good.

1064
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:39,050
That is bad.

1065
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:35,500
They're down on this floor somewhere.

1066
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,000
Down there.

1067
01:37:56,750 --> 01:37:58,200
Duncan!

1068
01:38:14,650 --> 01:38:17,800
Back! Keep him back from me!

1069
01:38:28,050 --> 01:38:30,350
You wish now to join your wife?

1070
01:38:30,650 --> 01:38:32,300
Is that it, traitor?

1071
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:34,400
She lives?

1072
01:38:34,850 --> 01:38:36,750
You wish to join her?

1073
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:41,500
Join her, then.

1074
01:38:49,950 --> 01:38:52,200
You think you've defeated me?

1075
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:59,650
You think I don't know
what I've gained for my wife?

1076
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:08,450
Take him away.

1077
01:39:10,700 --> 01:39:11,900
Guards!

1078
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:33,950
Where are they?

1079
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:35,600
They're over the great desert.

1080
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:37,700
Continue reconnaissance.

1081
01:40:01,850 --> 01:40:03,450
<i>Yueh's sign.</i>

1082
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:08,900
<i>He's left us stillsuits.</i>

1083
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:19,450
Don't touch my mother!

1084
01:40:19,550 --> 01:40:21,350
<i>He's trying the Voice.</i>

1085
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:23,750
<i>The Reverend Mother
said it could save him.</i>

1086
01:40:23,850 --> 01:40:26,600
- Did you hear a noise from the little one?
- Huh?

1087
01:40:27,250 --> 01:40:29,800
I didn't hear anything.

1088
01:40:33,150 --> 01:40:34,700
The little one.

1089
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:40,300
I'd like to have some fun before we kill her.

1090
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:54,350
- Remove her gag.
- <i>Excellent!</i>

1091
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:02,800
<i>Remove her gag.</i>

1092
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:14,600
There's no need to fight over me.

1093
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:20,200
<i>...to fight over me.</i>

1094
01:41:25,450 --> 01:41:26,900
<i>A poisoned blade.</i>

1095
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:41,400
First cut my son's bonds.

1096
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:48,900
<i>...my son's bonds.</i>

1097
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,400
That's it.

1098
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:53,200
<i>That's it.</i>

1099
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:04,650
Oh, my God!

1100
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:38,400
Duke Leto Atreides.

1101
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:08,300
Someone's torn the insignia
off your uniform.

1102
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:11,400
That's careless.

1103
01:43:11,550 --> 01:43:12,850
It was fate.

1104
01:43:16,150 --> 01:43:17,450
You don't say?

1105
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:26,600
Fate.

1106
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:30,400
Duke Leto Atreides.

1107
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,950
Where is the ducal signet ring?

1108
01:43:38,350 --> 01:43:40,900
I must have his ring.

1109
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:44,350
The ring!

1110
01:43:47,950 --> 01:43:51,150
He was brought to us as is, my lord Baron.

1111
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:55,800
You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!

1112
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:00,400
<i>The doctor, Yueh, what did he say?</i>

1113
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:03,250
<i>Paul and Jessica safe.</i>

1114
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:05,900
<i>Yes. The tooth!</i>

1115
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:08,300
He's coming around, Baron.

1116
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:09,800
Where's your ring?

1117
01:44:10,950 --> 01:44:11,900
Huh?

1118
01:44:13,150 --> 01:44:14,450
You do not answer?

1119
01:44:14,550 --> 01:44:16,500
<i>Wait! Wait!</i>

1120
01:44:17,350 --> 01:44:19,600
<i>You must come closer.</i>

1121
01:44:20,650 --> 01:44:23,950
The water of my life

1122
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:27,750
for Paul.

1123
01:44:28,250 --> 01:44:31,550
He's crying. He's crying!

1124
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:34,500
What does that mean, Piter?

1125
01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:39,600
<i>Come closer, Baron.</i>

1126
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:49,950
<i>Jessica!</i>

1127
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:51,450
<i>Paul!</i>

1128
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:53,150
Leto!

1129
01:44:54,350 --> 01:44:56,250
Leto, he's dead!

1130
01:44:56,550 --> 01:44:58,450
Oh, he's dead!

1131
01:44:59,850 --> 01:45:00,950
I know.

1132
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:10,200
Am I alive?

1133
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:13,400
I'm alive?

1134
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:14,500
Yes.

1135
01:45:15,850 --> 01:45:17,850
You're alive, my Baron.

1136
01:45:18,650 --> 01:45:20,450
I'm alive, eh?

1137
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,850
I'm alive!

1138
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:26,550
I'm alive! I'm alive!

1139
01:45:40,900 --> 01:45:43,100
I can't maintain any altitude.

1140
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:46,000
I'll never reach the safety of rock.

1141
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:52,000
Maybe that small rock.

1142
01:45:52,550 --> 01:45:54,300
Where are we, do you think?

1143
01:45:54,450 --> 01:45:56,200
The south polar regions.

1144
01:45:56,650 --> 01:45:58,000
The forbidden area.

1145
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:00,300
Hold on.

1146
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:10,850
Hurry!

1147
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:15,200
Take the stillsuits!

1148
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:18,200
Hurry!

1149
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:20,250
This crash might bring a worm.

1150
01:46:25,550 --> 01:46:26,750
The signet.

1151
01:46:26,850 --> 01:46:29,600
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh!

1152
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:54,450
<i>Where are my feelings?</i>

1153
01:46:54,550 --> 01:46:56,400
<i>I feel for no one.</i>

1154
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:02,650
<i>The second moon.</i>

1155
01:47:18,350 --> 01:47:21,550
<i>I mean Paul Atreides.</i>

1156
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,450
<i>We want him killed.</i>

1157
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:28,000
<i>Why? Why do they want me killed?</i>

1158
01:47:29,050 --> 01:47:31,900
<i>It has to be something to do with the spice.</i>

1159
01:47:32,750 --> 01:47:34,100
<i>But what?</i>

1160
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:44,200
<i>He who controls the spice,
controls the Universe!</i>

1161
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:54,700
<i>This moon holds my future.</i>

1162
01:48:07,950 --> 01:48:11,150
<i>Never one drop of rain on Arrakis.</i>

1163
01:48:14,850 --> 01:48:18,350
<i>The sleeper must awaken.</i>

1164
01:48:27,050 --> 01:48:28,900
<i>They will call me</i>

1165
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:31,200
<i>Muad'Dib.</i>

1166
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:41,600
Listen to me. Listen!

1167
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:44,900
You wanted to know about my dreams.

1168
01:48:45,950 --> 01:48:48,400
Well, I've just had a waking dream.

1169
01:48:49,850 --> 01:48:52,650
Do you know why? The spice!

1170
01:48:53,550 --> 01:48:55,450
It's in everything here.

1171
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:57,500
Calm yourself.

1172
01:48:57,700 --> 01:48:59,700
Like the Truthsayer drug.

1173
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:02,800
It's a poison.

1174
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:06,300
You knew the spice would change me.

1175
01:49:07,300 --> 01:49:08,800
But thanks to your teachings,

1176
01:49:08,900 --> 01:49:11,100
it's changing my consciousness.

1177
01:49:11,350 --> 01:49:14,200
I see it! I can see it!

1178
01:49:14,950 --> 01:49:16,500
<i>Is he the one?</i>

1179
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,550
You carry my unborn sister in your womb.

1180
01:49:20,650 --> 01:49:21,950
<i>He knows.</i>

1181
01:49:33,250 --> 01:49:34,600
Father!

1182
01:49:38,850 --> 01:49:41,750
<i>Father, I promise,</i>

1183
01:49:41,850 --> 01:49:44,600
<i>one day the sleeper will awaken.</i>

1184
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:48,000
<i>And I will avenge your death.</i>

1185
01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:51,450
<i>I will not stop until I destroy</i>

1186
01:49:51,550 --> 01:49:53,700
<i>the Emperor and the Baron.</i>

1187
01:49:59,150 --> 01:50:00,350
Father.

1188
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:17,450
Go now.

1189
01:50:20,150 --> 01:50:24,050
Take him to his desert to die.

1190
01:50:26,050 --> 01:50:27,450
Go.

1191
01:50:58,850 --> 01:51:02,050
<i>Yueh's left the plan
for the weirding modules.</i>

1192
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:15,600
We have to get to that mountain of rock.

1193
01:51:17,300 --> 01:51:20,900
We have entered the time when all
will turn against us and seek our lives.

1194
01:51:37,150 --> 01:51:39,100
It's further than I thought.

1195
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:42,350
A worm is sure to come.

1196
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:49,100
I'm ready.

1197
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:21,600
Faster!

1198
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:25,250
It's deafening!

1199
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:43,850
<i>The spice!</i>

1200
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:47,650
Do you smell it?

1201
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:48,950
Yes!

1202
01:53:56,350 --> 01:53:57,350
Paul!

1203
01:54:13,950 --> 01:54:14,950
Paul!

1204
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:28,050
<i>A thumper.</i>

1205
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:41,800
<i>The worm! Spice!</i>

1206
01:54:42,350 --> 01:54:44,100
<i>Is there a relationship?</i>

1207
01:54:57,750 --> 01:54:59,100
What's happened?

1208
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:01,000
Why did it leave?

1209
01:55:02,050 --> 01:55:05,000
Someone started a thumper.

1210
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:09,800
We're not alone.

1211
01:55:39,250 --> 01:55:41,000
Man-carved steps.

1212
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:42,450
Yes.

1213
01:55:56,750 --> 01:56:00,200
<i>Such stealth. I didn't hear them.</i>

1214
01:56:00,350 --> 01:56:03,750
Perhaps these are the ones
the Shadout Mapes told us of.

1215
01:56:04,050 --> 01:56:05,750
I will take the boy-man.

1216
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:08,850
He shall have sanctuary in my tribe.

1217
01:56:17,350 --> 01:56:19,800
Stop! Get back!

1218
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,100
She has the weirding way.

1219
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:25,800
Great gods!

1220
01:56:26,550 --> 01:56:29,400
If you can do this to the strongest of us,

1221
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:32,950
you're worth ten times your weight of water.

1222
01:56:35,950 --> 01:56:38,750
As the leader of my people,
I give you my bond.

1223
01:56:39,750 --> 01:56:42,250
Teach us this weirding way,

1224
01:56:42,700 --> 01:56:45,500
and you both shall have sanctuary.

1225
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:48,550
Your water shall mingle with our water.

1226
01:56:50,250 --> 01:56:52,750
Then I will teach you our way of battle.

1227
01:56:56,900 --> 01:57:00,250
I give you the word bond
of a Bene Gesserit.

1228
01:57:00,750 --> 01:57:02,450
It is the legend.

1229
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,950
I am Chani, daughter of Liet.

1230
01:57:12,450 --> 01:57:15,550
I would not have permitted you
to harm my tribe.

1231
01:57:17,100 --> 01:57:18,550
<i>From my dreams.</i>

1232
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:21,550
<i>So beautiful.</i>

1233
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:23,600
Come with me.

1234
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:25,800
I'll show you an easier way down.

1235
01:57:38,950 --> 01:57:40,650
He surprised me.

1236
01:57:41,900 --> 01:57:43,650
It was an accident.

1237
01:57:44,450 --> 01:57:48,750
Stilgar, I invoke the Amtal Rule.

1238
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:51,200
Jamis, you force this fight.

1239
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:53,700
These people have my countenance.

1240
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:57,100
If you should win, I will cut you down.

1241
01:57:57,200 --> 01:57:59,000
Jamis, I don't want to fight you.

1242
01:57:59,100 --> 01:58:01,300
- Maybe if I explain.
- Explain?

1243
01:58:02,250 --> 01:58:04,050
Explain death.

1244
01:58:04,150 --> 01:58:08,500
I am going to sheath my knife in your blood.

1245
01:58:10,150 --> 01:58:11,550
No shields.

1246
01:58:12,350 --> 01:58:14,250
I'm used to shield fighting.

1247
01:58:15,100 --> 01:58:16,650
Take my crysknife.

1248
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:23,500
Jamis turns to the right
with his knife after a parry.

1249
01:58:24,850 --> 01:58:26,950
And watch for a knife switch.

1250
01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:44,700
May thy knife chip and shatter.

1251
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:36,100
You have strength.

1252
01:59:37,100 --> 01:59:39,250
You shall be known as Usul,

1253
01:59:39,400 --> 01:59:42,200
which is the strength
of the base of the pillar.

1254
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:45,200
This is your secret name in our troop.

1255
01:59:45,950 --> 01:59:48,650
But you must choose
the name of manhood,

1256
01:59:49,150 --> 01:59:51,350
which we will call you openly.

1257
01:59:54,350 --> 01:59:57,700
What do you call the mouse
shadow in the second moon?

1258
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:03,400
We call that one Muad'Dib.

1259
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:07,000
Could I be known as Paul Muad'Dib?

1260
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:10,050
You are Paul Muad'Dib.

1261
02:00:11,550 --> 02:00:14,650
And your mother shall be
a Sayyadina among us.

1262
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:17,150
We welcome you.

1263
02:00:18,650 --> 02:00:21,550
<i>The dream unfolds.</i>

1264
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:28,450
And now...

1265
02:00:30,700 --> 02:00:32,050
the prophecy.

1266
02:00:34,450 --> 02:00:36,550
One will come.

1267
02:00:37,700 --> 02:00:40,100
The voice from the outer world.

1268
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,300
Bringing the Holy War,

1269
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:45,200
the Jihad,

1270
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:47,750
which will cleanse the Universe

1271
02:00:47,950 --> 02:00:51,700
and bring us out of darkness.

1272
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:18,250
The wife and sons of Jamis.

1273
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:42,150
This water belongs to Usul.

1274
02:02:42,550 --> 02:02:44,950
May he guard it for the tribe.

1275
02:02:45,300 --> 02:02:48,250
May he be generous
with it in times of need.

1276
02:02:53,050 --> 02:02:57,100
Jamis carried 33 liters and
7 and 3.30 second drachms.

1277
02:02:57,200 --> 02:02:58,800
Do you accept them?

1278
02:03:02,300 --> 02:03:03,300
Yes.

1279
02:03:05,250 --> 02:03:06,700
Water masters!

1280
02:03:42,300 --> 02:03:43,500
Moisture!

1281
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:44,800
Wind traps.

1282
02:03:45,950 --> 02:03:47,400
Huge ones.

1283
02:03:55,300 --> 02:03:58,200
Water. Millions of decaliters.

1284
02:03:59,250 --> 02:04:00,800
A treasure.

1285
02:04:00,950 --> 02:04:03,050
Greater than treasure, Usul.

1286
02:04:03,950 --> 02:04:07,000
We have thousands of such caches,

1287
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:11,400
and only a few of us know them all.

1288
02:04:11,950 --> 02:04:14,150
And when we have enough,

1289
02:04:15,050 --> 02:04:17,950
we shall change the face of Arrakis.

1290
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:40,300
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

1291
02:04:43,450 --> 02:04:45,850
<i>Tell me of your home world, Usul.</i>

1292
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:08,150
What is it?

1293
02:05:09,600 --> 02:05:12,200
Liet, Chani's father,

1294
02:05:12,300 --> 02:05:15,850
and the leader of our people, is dead.

1295
02:05:15,950 --> 02:05:17,700
Killed by the Harkonnen.

1296
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:21,200
<i>For the father, nothing.</i>

1297
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,350
Both of us have lost our fathers.

1298
02:06:16,050 --> 02:06:18,150
Rabban! Rabban!

1299
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:22,700
We're knee-deep in Atreides blood!

1300
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:24,750
We've gutted them!

1301
02:06:24,850 --> 02:06:26,500
We've gutted them!

1302
02:06:30,850 --> 02:06:33,550
Rabban! Rabban!

1303
02:06:34,950 --> 02:06:37,800
I place you in charge of Arrakis.

1304
02:06:37,900 --> 02:06:40,800
It's yours to squeeze, as I promised.

1305
02:06:40,900 --> 02:06:45,700
I want you to squeeze
and squeeze and squeeze!

1306
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:48,600
Give me spice! Drive them!

1307
02:06:48,700 --> 02:06:50,700
Drive them into utter submission!

1308
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:53,900
Do not show the slightest pity or mercy!

1309
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,150
Never stop! Go! Go!

1310
02:06:57,250 --> 02:06:58,400
Show no mercy!

1311
02:06:58,500 --> 02:06:59,650
Yes, Baron!

1312
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:20,100
Feyd.

1313
02:07:27,900 --> 02:07:32,400
And when we've crushed
these people enough,

1314
02:07:33,550 --> 02:07:35,400
I'll send you.

1315
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:37,350
Feyd.

1316
02:07:41,850 --> 02:07:43,450
Lovely Feyd.

1317
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:52,350
Where's my doctor?!

1318
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:00,300
<i>Jessica,</i>

1319
02:08:02,300 --> 02:08:04,700
<i>our Reverend Mother is too old.</i>

1320
02:08:05,650 --> 02:08:08,150
<i>She has been calling
through space and time</i>

1321
02:08:08,250 --> 02:08:10,400
<i>for you to come and let her rest.</i>

1322
02:08:11,850 --> 02:08:14,650
<i>She asks that you pass within</i>

1323
02:08:15,500 --> 02:08:17,550
<i>and become our Reverend Mother.</i>

1324
02:08:19,150 --> 02:08:23,300
If you be a Reverend Mother,

1325
02:08:25,550 --> 02:08:29,300
let Shai-Hulud judge now!

1326
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:34,900
<i>The Water of Life.</i>

1327
02:08:38,750 --> 02:08:41,300
<i>But what of my unborn child?</i>

1328
02:08:42,600 --> 02:08:45,700
<i>One day, I will have to do this.</i>

1329
02:09:02,750 --> 02:09:05,000
<i>Following the Bene Gesserit tradition,</i>

1330
02:09:05,100 --> 02:09:07,300
<i>the old Reverend Mother
surrendered her life</i>

1331
02:09:07,400 --> 02:09:09,600
<i>as she surrendered her knowledge.</i>

1332
02:09:10,350 --> 02:09:14,500
<i>Jessica had successfully transmuted
the poisonous Water of Life.</i>

1333
02:09:15,100 --> 02:09:18,150
<i>Every man who has tried has died.</i>

1334
02:09:19,500 --> 02:09:21,250
<i>Am I the one?</i>

1335
02:09:22,150 --> 02:09:24,900
<i>The sleeper must awaken.</i>

1336
02:09:32,150 --> 02:09:34,650
<i>The tremendous power of the Water of Life</i>

1337
02:09:34,900 --> 02:09:38,500
<i>caused the premature birth
of Jessica's daughter, Alia.</i>

1338
02:09:39,450 --> 02:09:43,550
<i>Alia was born with all the knowledge
and powers of a Reverend Mother.</i>

1339
02:10:11,450 --> 02:10:14,950
Feyd, even though he's aging,

1340
02:10:15,150 --> 02:10:18,450
Thufir is one of the finest Mentats
in the Universe.

1341
02:10:19,400 --> 02:10:23,150
And he's mine, Feyd, all mine.

1342
02:10:26,550 --> 02:10:28,550
- Quiet now.
- I will.

1343
02:10:28,650 --> 02:10:29,900
Come.

1344
02:10:43,700 --> 02:10:45,200
Oh, Thufir!

1345
02:10:46,200 --> 02:10:49,000
I see they've installed
your heart plug already.

1346
02:10:50,650 --> 02:10:53,050
Don't be angry.
Everyone gets one here.

1347
02:10:54,250 --> 02:10:56,150
But this is not why we're here.

1348
02:10:57,400 --> 02:10:59,900
We've brought you a little cat, Thufir.

1349
02:11:01,450 --> 02:11:03,950
You must care for it, if you wish to live.

1350
02:11:05,150 --> 02:11:09,100
A poison has been introduced
into your body, Thufir Hawat.

1351
02:11:09,900 --> 02:11:13,700
By milking this smooth, little cat body,

1352
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:15,750
you receive your antidote.

1353
02:11:15,900 --> 02:11:17,950
It must be done each day.

1354
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:26,000
All I can see is an Atreides
that I want to kill.

1355
02:11:26,950 --> 02:11:29,850
Feyd, no, no!

1356
02:11:30,950 --> 02:11:33,500
Thufir's a Harkonnen now.

1357
02:11:33,700 --> 02:11:35,700
Aren't you, Thufir?

1358
02:11:36,350 --> 02:11:40,250
<i>My Duke, how I've failed you.</i>

1359
02:11:58,450 --> 02:12:00,400
<i>Chani, I love you.</i>

1360
02:12:02,450 --> 02:12:03,950
<i>I've always loved you.</i>

1361
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:31,700
<i>The Holy Warriors.</i>

1362
02:12:32,750 --> 02:12:35,250
<i>No one ever dreamed there were so many.</i>

1363
02:12:36,850 --> 02:12:41,200
I am Usul. Paul Muad'Dib.

1364
02:12:45,150 --> 02:12:47,450
Our shared enemy, the Harkonnens,

1365
02:12:47,550 --> 02:12:49,850
are once again in control of Arrakis.

1366
02:12:51,200 --> 02:12:53,350
Stilgar, your leader,

1367
02:12:53,700 --> 02:12:56,800
has asked me and my mother
to teach you the weirding way

1368
02:12:56,900 --> 02:12:58,400
to crush the Harkonnens.

1369
02:12:59,900 --> 02:13:01,800
We must do more than this.

1370
02:13:02,700 --> 02:13:06,400
We must totally destroy
all spice production on Arrakis.

1371
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,600
The Guild and the entire
Universe depends on spice.

1372
02:13:13,050 --> 02:13:16,050
He who can destroy a thing,
controls a thing.

1373
02:13:17,350 --> 02:13:20,150
I will take 100 of your warriors
and train them.

1374
02:13:20,900 --> 02:13:23,550
This 100 will train the thousands
that remain.

1375
02:13:24,600 --> 02:13:26,650
When the spice flow stops,

1376
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:29,500
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.

1377
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:34,200
The Baron and the Emperor himself
will be forced to deal with us.

1378
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:42,200
Arrakis will become
the center of the Universe.

1379
02:13:44,450 --> 02:13:45,450
Orato!

1380
02:13:49,250 --> 02:13:52,800
This obelisk is of your hardest stone.

1381
02:13:54,950 --> 02:13:55,950
Kick it.

1382
02:14:02,800 --> 02:14:03,800
Hit it.

1383
02:14:09,400 --> 02:14:10,750
Yell at it.

1384
02:14:16,300 --> 02:14:17,550
Break!

1385
02:14:19,950 --> 02:14:22,550
Korba, cut it.

1386
02:14:35,900 --> 02:14:37,300
Move back.

1387
02:15:06,300 --> 02:15:09,550
This is part of the weirding way
that we will teach you.

1388
02:15:12,350 --> 02:15:15,850
Some thoughts have a certain sound

1389
02:15:16,750 --> 02:15:19,000
that being the equivalent to a form.

1390
02:15:19,750 --> 02:15:21,900
Through sound and motion,

1391
02:15:22,300 --> 02:15:26,350
you will be able to paralyze
nerves, shatter bones,

1392
02:15:26,700 --> 02:15:30,950
set fires, suffocate an enemy,
or burst his organs.

1393
02:15:31,550 --> 02:15:35,800
We will kill until no Harkonnen
breathes Arrakeen air.

1394
02:15:35,900 --> 02:15:38,300
<b>Muad'Dib!</b>

1395
02:15:48,850 --> 02:15:50,000
Stilgar.

1396
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:54,250
- Muad'Dib.
- Hmm?

1397
02:15:54,350 --> 02:15:57,500
<i>Muad'Dib.</i>

1398
02:16:02,450 --> 02:16:05,000
<i>My name is a killing word.</i>

1399
02:16:05,300 --> 02:16:07,500
<i>They are ready to fight.</i>

1400
02:16:07,600 --> 02:16:09,350
<i>Yet in order to lead them,</i>

1401
02:16:09,450 --> 02:16:12,700
<i>I must conquer the worm,
conquer Shai-Hulud.</i>

1402
02:16:40,200 --> 02:16:43,200
Usul, it is time you become a sand rider

1403
02:16:43,300 --> 02:16:45,250
and travel as a Fremen.

1404
02:16:46,550 --> 02:16:49,300
Take the kiswa maker hook of our sietch

1405
02:16:50,050 --> 02:16:52,300
and ride as a leader of men.

1406
02:17:00,350 --> 02:17:01,900
Two thumpers are planted.

1407
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:03,950
The worm may not surface for the first.

1408
02:17:04,050 --> 02:17:06,050
He will rise for the second.

1409
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:08,050
And remember,

1410
02:17:08,800 --> 02:17:11,900
when the worm approaches,
you must be utterly still

1411
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,050
and close enough to plant the hook

1412
02:17:14,150 --> 02:17:16,450
firmly under a ring segment.

1413
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:19,200
The worm will turn to lift this exposed area

1414
02:17:19,300 --> 02:17:21,550
as far from the abrasive sand as possible,

1415
02:17:21,650 --> 02:17:24,600
and it will take you with it to the top.

1416
02:17:26,350 --> 02:17:27,650
Do not get too close.

1417
02:17:27,750 --> 02:17:30,300
As he approaches,
the sand will engulf you.

1418
02:17:34,350 --> 02:17:36,650
Wait till the head of the worm passes,

1419
02:17:36,750 --> 02:17:39,200
then go, quickly.

1420
02:18:03,300 --> 02:18:05,500
Shai-Hulud.

1421
02:18:45,850 --> 02:18:49,350
<i>I must not fear. Fear is the mind killer.</i>

1422
02:18:58,150 --> 02:19:00,900
<i>Only the very strong ones travel this deep.</i>

1423
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:04,150
Usul has called a big one!

1424
02:19:04,650 --> 02:19:07,300
Again, it is the legend.

1425
02:21:06,750 --> 02:21:09,400
<i>Now we are ready for battle.</i>

1426
02:21:19,900 --> 02:21:23,750
Usul, these are 15 of our finest warriors

1427
02:21:23,950 --> 02:21:27,000
to serve you as your guard.

1428
02:21:31,750 --> 02:21:33,300
The Fedaykin.

1429
02:21:51,600 --> 02:21:52,600
Now.

1430
02:22:40,850 --> 02:22:41,850
Muad'Dib.

1431
02:22:53,850 --> 02:22:57,350
<i>When the spice flow stops,
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.</i>

1432
02:22:58,050 --> 02:23:02,000
<i>The Baron and the Emperor himself
will be forced to deal with us.</i>

1433
02:23:05,750 --> 02:23:10,200
Muad'Dib.

1434
02:23:10,300 --> 02:23:11,700
- What happened?
- Muad'Dib!

1435
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:15,000
- What happened to you and your men?
- Muad'Dib, Muad'Dib!

1436
02:23:15,100 --> 02:23:16,900
- What are you saying?
- Muad'Dib!

1437
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,000
- What are you saying?
- Muad'Dib!

1438
02:23:18,100 --> 02:23:19,100
- What?
- Muad'Dib!

1439
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:20,200
Muad'Dib!

1440
02:23:22,100 --> 02:23:25,050
<i>He's been repeating that name
ever since we found him.</i>

1441
02:23:25,700 --> 02:23:29,950
Who is this Muad'Dib?

1442
02:23:36,300 --> 02:23:39,150
<i>In the two standard years that followed,</i>

1443
02:23:39,250 --> 02:23:43,600
<i>Muad'Dib and the Fremen brought
spice production to a standstill.</i>

1444
02:23:44,300 --> 02:23:47,250
<i>Fearing for his life, Rabban did his best</i>

1445
02:23:47,350 --> 02:23:50,600
<i>to hide this fact from his uncle, the Baron.</i>

1446
02:23:57,100 --> 02:24:00,500
<i>Paul's sister Alia matured
at a frightening rate.</i>

1447
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:03,650
<i>Her small body harbored
tremendous powers.</i>

1448
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:07,850
<i>Paul and Chani's love grew.</i>

1449
02:24:13,100 --> 02:24:14,700
We surprised a band of smugglers.

1450
02:24:14,800 --> 02:24:16,600
Too bad. I thought they were Harkonnen.

1451
02:24:29,150 --> 02:24:30,450
Gurney!

1452
02:24:34,150 --> 02:24:36,900
You've no need of your weapons
with me, Gurney Halleck.

1453
02:24:37,500 --> 02:24:38,500
Paul?

1454
02:24:40,450 --> 02:24:41,450
Paul?

1455
02:24:41,550 --> 02:24:43,200
Don't you trust
your own eyes?

1456
02:24:43,350 --> 02:24:45,050
They said you were dead.

1457
02:24:47,900 --> 02:24:48,900
They...

1458
02:24:49,650 --> 02:24:50,600
They said...

1459
02:24:56,300 --> 02:24:58,300
- Gurney!
- You young pup!

1460
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:00,700
- Gurney!
- You young pup!

1461
02:25:08,500 --> 02:25:10,900
Do you know of the Water of Life?

1462
02:25:13,700 --> 02:25:18,500
Come watch the mystery of mysteries.

1463
02:25:19,350 --> 02:25:22,100
The end and the beginning.

1464
02:26:16,600 --> 02:26:18,400
The Water of Life.

1465
02:26:25,250 --> 02:26:27,200
The Water of Life.

1466
02:26:47,800 --> 02:26:49,900
<i>Emperor Shaddam IV,</i>

1467
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:53,950
<i>you have one last chance to
take matters into your own hands</i>

1468
02:26:54,050 --> 02:26:57,400
<i>and bring the situation
under control on Arrakis.</i>

1469
02:26:57,500 --> 02:26:58,700
- What do you mean, one last--
- <i>Silence!</i>

1470
02:26:58,800 --> 02:27:01,000
<i>Do not speak! Listen!</i>

1471
02:27:01,100 --> 02:27:03,950
<i>You do not have more
than this one chance.</i>

1472
02:27:04,250 --> 02:27:06,850
<i>I represent the entire Guild in this matter.</i>

1473
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:11,450
<i>Our navigators warn you that spice
production is in great danger.</i>

1474
02:27:11,550 --> 02:27:13,800
<i>A new Fremen leader, Muad'Dib,</i>

1475
02:27:13,950 --> 02:27:16,200
<i>has stopped spice mining on Arrakis.</i>

1476
02:27:16,300 --> 02:27:19,500
<i>Our navigators suggest
he is not of Arrakis.</i>

1477
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:22,450
<i>No one on the outside world
has been able to see him.</i>

1478
02:27:22,550 --> 02:27:24,650
<i>We do not know who he is.</i>

1479
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,200
<i>The Harkonnens cannot stop him.</i>

1480
02:27:28,050 --> 02:27:31,550
<i>Remedy this situation,
restore spice production,</i>

1481
02:27:31,650 --> 02:27:34,600
<i>or you'll live out your life
in a pain amplifier.</i>

1482
02:27:42,750 --> 02:27:44,250
<i>The Emperor will stop him.</i>

1483
02:27:44,350 --> 02:27:46,050
<i>He won't take the Water of Life.</i>

1484
02:27:47,050 --> 02:27:49,150
<i>That's why they want me killed.</i>

1485
02:27:49,300 --> 02:27:51,650
<i>They're afraid I'll take the Water of Life.</i>

1486
02:27:52,800 --> 02:27:56,250
I want 50 legions of Sardaukar
on Arrakis at once!

1487
02:27:56,600 --> 02:27:58,200
50 legions?

1488
02:27:58,350 --> 02:27:59,950
That's our entire reserves as well.

1489
02:28:00,050 --> 02:28:01,400
This is genocide,

1490
02:28:01,500 --> 02:28:05,700
the deliberate and systematic
destruction of all life on Arrakis!

1491
02:28:07,450 --> 02:28:09,000
<i>The Emperor is coming!</i>

1492
02:28:10,500 --> 02:28:11,600
<i>Chani!</i>

1493
02:28:13,700 --> 02:28:17,250
You were calling my name.
It frightened me.

1494
02:28:18,450 --> 02:28:19,550
Oh, Chani!

1495
02:28:20,950 --> 02:28:23,150
All the images of my future are gone.

1496
02:28:25,950 --> 02:28:28,350
I have to drink the Water of Life.

1497
02:28:28,500 --> 02:28:30,900
No, Paul, please.

1498
02:28:31,300 --> 02:28:33,050
I've seen the men who have tried.

1499
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:34,900
I've seen how they died.

1500
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:38,850
I'm dead to everyone unless
I try to become what I may be.

1501
02:28:41,850 --> 02:28:44,850
Only the Water of Life
will free what can save us.

1502
02:28:45,750 --> 02:28:46,850
Paul...

1503
02:28:51,050 --> 02:28:52,950
I must drink the sacred water.

1504
02:28:56,500 --> 02:28:58,100
We must go now.

1505
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:56,250
Hurry. All I see is darkness.

1506
02:29:57,250 --> 02:29:58,350
Paul...

1507
02:30:00,850 --> 02:30:02,800
I will love you forever.

1508
02:30:03,500 --> 02:30:05,450
You are my life.

1509
02:30:15,350 --> 02:30:17,000
You are my life.

1510
02:30:23,400 --> 02:30:25,400
<i>Many men have tried.</i>

1511
02:30:25,550 --> 02:30:27,600
<i>They tried and failed?</i>

1512
02:30:28,100 --> 02:30:29,800
<i>They tried and died.</i>

1513
02:30:38,500 --> 02:30:40,450
<i>The worm is the spice.</i>

1514
02:30:40,600 --> 02:30:42,500
<i>The spice is the worm.</i>

1515
02:31:02,750 --> 02:31:04,650
<i>The worms.</i>

1516
02:31:21,300 --> 02:31:23,600
<i>They're not attacking. Why?</i>

1517
02:31:45,150 --> 02:31:46,700
<i>There is a place,</i>

1518
02:31:48,200 --> 02:31:50,000
<i>terrifying to us,</i>

1519
02:31:50,300 --> 02:31:51,550
<i>to women.</i>

1520
02:31:51,750 --> 02:31:54,450
<i>This is the place they cannot look.</i>

1521
02:32:01,450 --> 02:32:04,500
<i>Traveling without moving.</i>

1522
02:32:06,400 --> 02:32:08,950
<i>Now I truly control the worm</i>

1523
02:32:09,950 --> 02:32:11,750
<i>and the spice.</i>

1524
02:32:13,250 --> 02:32:17,450
<i>And I have the power
to destroy the spice forever!</i>

1525
02:32:47,700 --> 02:32:48,650
Paul.

1526
02:32:49,950 --> 02:32:50,950
Paul.

1527
02:32:52,150 --> 02:32:53,150
Paul.

1528
02:33:00,750 --> 02:33:02,100
Father!

1529
02:33:05,750 --> 02:33:06,700
Father,

1530
02:33:07,250 --> 02:33:10,200
the sleeper has awakened!

1531
02:33:16,300 --> 02:33:28,900
<b>Muad'Dib.</b>

1536
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:30,150
Arrakis,

1537
02:33:31,650 --> 02:33:32,900
Dune,

1538
02:33:34,250 --> 02:33:35,750
Desert Planet.

1539
02:33:37,350 --> 02:33:39,350
Your time has come.

1540
02:33:40,250 --> 02:33:44,250
A storm is coming. Our storm.

1541
02:33:45,750 --> 02:33:49,000
And when it arrives,
it will shake the Universe.

1542
02:33:51,550 --> 02:33:55,150
Emperor, we come for you!

1543
02:33:56,050 --> 02:33:57,700
<i>The Emperor Shaddam IV</i>

1544
02:33:57,800 --> 02:33:59,950
<i>with his entourage and Sardaukar troops</i>

1545
02:34:00,050 --> 02:34:02,550
<i>set out immediately for Arrakis.</i>

1546
02:34:03,100 --> 02:34:04,800
<i>Sitting on his golden throne</i>

1547
02:34:04,900 --> 02:34:07,500
<i>in his luxurious and fortified spaceship,</i>

1548
02:34:07,700 --> 02:34:11,100
<i>the Emperor ponders on
his latest intelligence reports.</i>

1549
02:34:11,650 --> 02:34:15,600
<i>We will set down
on the pyramid's landing facility.</i>

1550
02:34:30,050 --> 02:34:32,550
Long live the fighters!

1551
02:34:32,750 --> 02:34:36,000
<b>Long live the fighters!</b>

1552
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:10,450
<i>Meanwhile, the Baron Harkonnen</i>

1553
02:35:10,600 --> 02:35:13,300
<i>having been alerted to trouble on Arrakis</i>

1554
02:35:13,400 --> 02:35:16,600
<i>is on route to check
on his nephew Rabban.</i>

1555
02:35:32,350 --> 02:35:34,000
<i>Suspicion confirmed.</i>

1556
02:35:34,100 --> 02:35:36,150
<i>The Emperor's had Rabban seized.</i>

1557
02:36:18,400 --> 02:36:20,300
Stand by the main control room.

1558
02:36:50,350 --> 02:36:53,500
Gurney, when the storm hits,
set off the atomics.

1559
02:36:54,600 --> 02:36:57,350
I want an opening through
the entire shield wall.

1560
02:36:59,100 --> 02:37:01,850
Stilgar, do we have wormsign?

1561
02:37:04,850 --> 02:37:09,150
Usul, we have wormsign, the likes
of which even God has never seen.

1562
02:38:05,250 --> 02:38:09,500
Bring in that floating fat man, the Baron.

1563
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:29,800
Why have you brought me here?

1564
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:33,500
Your Highness,
there must be some mistake.

1565
02:38:34,100 --> 02:38:36,000
I never requested your presence.

1566
02:38:36,100 --> 02:38:37,100
Ah!

1567
02:38:37,500 --> 02:38:39,850
But your lack of action demanded it.

1568
02:38:39,950 --> 02:38:41,550
Your dreadful mismanagement,

1569
02:38:41,650 --> 02:38:45,600
your bad judgment in assigning
to Rabban the governorship.

1570
02:38:46,100 --> 02:38:47,500
You've forced me to come here

1571
02:38:47,600 --> 02:38:50,050
and set things straight, personally.

1572
02:38:50,350 --> 02:38:53,750
And why did you not tell me of
the fighting ability of these people?

1573
02:38:53,850 --> 02:38:56,500
We've just flushed out a nest
of them in the open desert

1574
02:38:56,600 --> 02:39:00,900
and the women and children
overpowered some of our Sardaukar.

1575
02:39:01,050 --> 02:39:03,350
We managed only one hostage.

1576
02:39:03,550 --> 02:39:05,050
Bring in the hostage!

1577
02:39:06,200 --> 02:39:07,600
Only one!

1578
02:39:18,400 --> 02:39:21,950
I am a messenger from Muad'Dib.

1579
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:24,800
Poor Emperor.

1580
02:39:25,300 --> 02:39:29,100
I'm afraid my brother won't
be very pleased with you.

1581
02:39:29,200 --> 02:39:30,600
Silence!

1582
02:39:30,700 --> 02:39:32,350
Kill this child. She's an abomination.

1583
02:39:32,800 --> 02:39:33,850
Kill her!

1584
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,900
Get out of my mind!

1585
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,600
Not until you tell them both

1586
02:39:40,700 --> 02:39:43,450
who I really am.

1587
02:39:43,600 --> 02:39:48,000
<i>...who I really am.</i>

1588
02:39:45,350 --> 02:39:46,600
Alia...

1589
02:39:48,750 --> 02:39:52,050
daughter of Duke Leto the Just

1590
02:39:52,350 --> 02:39:55,050
and the royal Lady Jessica.

1591
02:39:55,950 --> 02:39:57,150
Sister

1592
02:39:58,050 --> 02:40:01,850
of Paul Muad'Dib.

1593
02:40:01,950 --> 02:40:05,850
Paul's sister? Paul is Muad'Dib?

1594
02:40:16,300 --> 02:40:18,600
Alia keeps pace with the storm.

1595
02:40:22,900 --> 02:40:26,300
<i>With the storm, their air power
will be useless.</i>

1597
02:40:26,750 --> 02:40:29,750
<i>On Arrakis, it's desert power.</i>

1598
02:40:30,200 --> 02:40:31,200
Gurney...

1599
02:40:32,950 --> 02:40:34,000
Now!

1600
02:40:34,150 --> 02:40:35,250
Atomics!

1601
02:41:16,350 --> 02:41:17,900
Our army awaits us.

1602
02:41:19,600 --> 02:41:24,550
My brother is coming
with many Fremen warriors.

1603
02:41:26,050 --> 02:41:27,250
Impossible!

1604
02:41:27,350 --> 02:41:29,200
Not impossible.

1605
02:41:29,350 --> 02:41:32,850
I told you. He is here now.

1606
02:41:39,600 --> 02:41:42,750
<i>Father, today I will avenge your death.</i>

1607
02:42:06,700 --> 02:42:09,650
<i>Emperor, an impassable storm
has descended.</i>

1608
02:42:09,750 --> 02:42:12,850
<i>The Shield Wall has been
penetrated by atomics.</i>

1609
02:42:14,650 --> 02:42:16,350
Release the Sardaukar.

1610
02:42:16,450 --> 02:42:20,600
Baron, give this little
abomination to the storm.

1611
02:42:21,950 --> 02:42:24,550
<i>Wait for my brother, Baron.</i>

1614
02:44:54,300 --> 02:44:56,150
<i>Wait for my brother.</i>

1615
02:45:09,800 --> 02:45:12,000
Muad'Dib!

1616
02:46:07,650 --> 02:46:08,950
<i>Alia, now.</i>

1617
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:10,900
<i>Come to me, Baron.</i>

1618
02:46:32,050 --> 02:46:34,250
<b>Muad'Dib!</b>

1619
02:47:32,350 --> 02:47:34,000
<b>Muad'Dib!</b>

1620
02:48:14,900 --> 02:48:16,700
<i>Feyd Rautha.</i>

1621
02:48:16,900 --> 02:48:19,300
Emperor Shaddam IV,

1622
02:48:19,400 --> 02:48:21,500
there are Guild Heighliners above us

1623
02:48:21,600 --> 02:48:24,050
containing many Great Houses
of the Landsraad.

1624
02:48:24,300 --> 02:48:25,800
Send them back.

1625
02:48:25,900 --> 02:48:27,600
How dare you speak to me in--

1626
02:48:27,700 --> 02:48:29,000
<i>Stop your speaking.</i>

1627
02:48:31,750 --> 02:48:34,150
You have some idea of what I could do.

1628
02:48:36,950 --> 02:48:39,800
Don't try your powers on me.

1629
02:48:40,950 --> 02:48:43,350
Try looking into that place
where you dare not look.

1630
02:48:43,450 --> 02:48:45,200
You'll find me there staring back at you.

1631
02:48:45,300 --> 02:48:47,600
- You mustn't speak--
- Silence!

1633
02:48:51,550 --> 02:48:53,350
I remember your gom jabbar.

1634
02:48:54,500 --> 02:48:56,300
Now you'll remember mine.

1635
02:48:56,450 --> 02:48:58,250
I can kill with a word.

1636
02:49:00,600 --> 02:49:02,800
And his word shall carry death eternal

1637
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:05,900
to those who stand against the righteous.

1638
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:07,500
The righteous?!

1639
02:49:07,600 --> 02:49:09,850
There is a Harkonnen among you.

1640
02:49:12,350 --> 02:49:16,250
Give the Harkonnen a blade,
and let him stand forth.

1641
02:49:16,350 --> 02:49:20,000
If Feyd wishes, he can meet you
with my blade in his hand.

1642
02:49:20,100 --> 02:49:21,200
I wish it.

1643
02:49:21,300 --> 02:49:23,300
This is a Harkonnen animal.

1644
02:49:24,100 --> 02:49:26,450
Let me. Please, my lord.

1645
02:49:27,100 --> 02:49:28,650
The Emperor's blade.

1646
02:49:59,650 --> 02:50:01,850
Why prolong the inevitable?

1647
02:50:04,800 --> 02:50:06,200
I will kill you.

1648
02:50:21,950 --> 02:50:23,500
I will kill him!

1649
02:50:30,400 --> 02:50:31,500
Paul!

1650
02:50:32,950 --> 02:50:34,750
I will kill him!

1651
02:50:44,600 --> 02:50:48,200
Who is the little one? A pet, perhaps?

1652
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:52,000
Will she deserve my special attentions?

1653
02:51:03,650 --> 02:51:06,450
You see your death.

1654
02:51:07,250 --> 02:51:09,250
My blade will finish you.

1655
02:51:11,450 --> 02:51:14,750
<i>I will bend like a reed in the wind.</i>

1657
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:40,550
Muad'Dib!

1658
02:51:41,350 --> 02:51:44,000
Usul no longer needs the weirding module.

1659
02:51:44,150 --> 02:51:48,650
<i>Muad'Dib had become the hand of God
fulfilling the Fremen prophecy.</i>

1661
02:51:49,250 --> 02:51:50,800
<i>Where there was war,</i>

1662
02:51:50,900 --> 02:51:53,150
<i>Muad'Dib would now bring peace.</i>

1663
02:51:53,700 --> 02:51:57,100
<i>Where there was hatred,
Muad'Dib would bring love</i>

1664
02:51:57,750 --> 02:52:00,400
<i>to lead the people to true freedom</i>

1665
02:52:00,600 --> 02:52:03,250
<i>and to change the face of Arrakis.</i>

1666
02:52:08,800 --> 02:52:10,700
We Fremen have a saying.

1667
02:52:11,800 --> 02:52:14,750
God created Arrakis to train the faithful.

1668
02:52:16,150 --> 02:52:19,000
One cannot go against the word of God.

1669
02:53:26,250 --> 02:53:28,350
And how can this be?

1670
02:53:30,500 --> 02:53:34,100
For he is the Kwisatz Haderach!
