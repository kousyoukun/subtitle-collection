快点 起床啦

我们走之前得给你家娃娃们买点礼物
You need to buy gifts for your kids before we leave.

5
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,920
不行
No way.

6
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,160
机场的礼物都是狗屁
Airport gifts suck.

7
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,960
玛丽 让我再睡半个小时
Marie, please let me sleep another half hour.

知道吗？现在全巴黎到处是我的海报
You know what? The posters are up, all over paris.

13

你看了多少了？

- Okay, I'll call room service. - Thank you.

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,640
他们说整个巴黎贴了120张
They said there would be 120 across paris.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,520
你能帮我总结一下标题吗？我没时间上网
Can you sum up the headlines for me? I won't have time to go online.

22
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,800
太好了
That's good.

23
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,520
大吻一个 拜拜
Big kisses, bye-bye.

37
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,720
把她翻过去
Roll her over on her side.

38
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,640
- 呼吸 呼吸  - 吐出来 好的 吐出来
- Breathe, breathe. - Vomit it out. Good, vomit.

39
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,200
把她翻过来背朝下
Turn her back around.

40
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,800
- 你还好吗？没事吧？- 是的

43
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,800
玛丽

- What? - You know I don't do this anymore.

48
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,680
我需要他 帮帮忙
Just one time. This guy's a real important client of mine. I need this. Come on.

安德鲁·奎斯托

53
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,920
奎斯托  好
Christos. Okay.

54
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,760
在我获得感应之前 我会握着你的双手 然后…
I'm gonna hold your hands just until I get a connection, and then...

55
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,240
…只是以通灵为目的 你只需回答"是"或者"不是"
...just for the purposes of the reading, confine your answers to yes or no.

56
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,080
把手给我？
Give me your hands?

57
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,240
一个你亲近的女人去世了？
A woman close to you has passed?

58
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,720
是
Yes.

59
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,200

00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,760
是
Yes.

62
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,000
我得知你们共同生活了好长时间
And I'm picking up you were together for a long time.

63
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,880
是

64
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,040
- 不过有时关系不太好  - 是
- But it wasn't always easy. - No.

65
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,000
- 现在我知道她病了  - 是
- Now I'm picking up she was sick. - Yep.

66

68
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,800

是 她得了多发性硬化病
Yes. She had multiple sclerosis.

70
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,120
真遗憾
I'm sorry.

71
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,920
她为毁掉了婚姻向你道歉
She wants to apologize to you for ruining the marriage.

72
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,160
那可不是真的
That's not true.

73
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,240
她为你不得不照顾她而内疚 甚至在你还是大小伙子的时候
She feels bad that you had to care for her, even as a young man...

74
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,560
…希望你趁着还不算晚再找个人
...and wishes that you'd find someone now, before it's too late.

75
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,120
因为你不再年轻了
Because you're not getting any younger.

76
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,040
也不苗条了
Or slimmer.

77
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,800
老了 也胖了
No.

78
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,800
她很幽默啊
She's got quite a sense of humor.

79
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,800
- 是的  - 她很有趣

80
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,960
好了 等等 现在她要我精力集中
Okay, wait. Now she's telling me to pay attention.

81
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,160
好的 她有些重要的事要说
Okay, she has something important she needs to say.

82
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,480
好 她好像在试着告诉我一个日期…6月
Okay, she's trying to give me some kind of a date. June.

83
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,560
6月里？
In June?

84
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,240
6月对你有什么意义吗？
Did that mean anything to you?

85
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,480
- 没有  - 你们在那时候结的婚？6月？
- No. - Is that when you were married? June?

86
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,080
- 她在那时候去世的？- 不是
- Is that when she passed? - No.

87
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,640
我的意思是 6月对她很特别
I mean, she's being very specific about June.

88
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,280
是的 6月
Yeah, June.

89
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,520
嗯 好吧 也许我错了 常有的事
Hm. Well, maybe I'm wrong. That happens.

90
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,240
我不再干这行了
I don't even do this anymore.

91
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,640
估计我脑子不灵了
Guess I'm rusty.

92
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,880
谢谢 不知道如何感谢你才好
Thank you. I can't thank you enough.

93
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,680
- 嘿 多谢 老弟  - 好的
- Hey. Thanks, baby brother. - Okay.

94
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,120
我欠你的
I owe you.

95
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,000
真是难以置信
That was incredible.

96
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,360
你的弟弟啊 我告诉你 他神了
Your brother, I'm telling you, he's for real.

97
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,520
- 我知道  - 不 不 不 他真是神了
- I know. - No, no, no. He's really for real.

98
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,840
我想告诉你 来之前我很怀疑 所有的通灵者都他妈的是…
I gotta tell you I was skeptical before I came. All this psychic shit is...

99
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,160
…至少我认为是瞎他妈扯蛋
...mumbo-fucking-jumbo as far as I'm concerned.

100
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,640
他刚才和我说的事 我从来没和别人说过
He was telling me things I'd never told anybody.

101
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,120
- 他可以挣钱的  - 他挣了 挣得不少呢
- He could make money. - He did. Good money.

102
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,720
有办公室 网站 报刊文章 甚至还有专门写他的书
Had an office, website, newspaper articles, even had a book written about him.

103
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,560
是吗？那这是怎么了？
Yeah? So, what happened?

104
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,040
应付不了了 全身而退
Couldn't cope. Turned his back on the whole thing.

105
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,560
他告诉过我 他说“充满死亡的生活根本就不是真正的生活”
He told me, he said, "A life that's all about death is no life at all."

106
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,960
现在他在一家工厂干活 月薪2000美元 他说现在很快乐
He works at a factory and makes 2 grand a month. He says he's happy.

107
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,280
谁知道呢？他不想再干这行了
Who knows? He wasn't gonna do this again.

108
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,800
我必须让他破一次例
I had to persuade him to make an exception.

109
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,920
好 非常感谢 伙计 我的意思是 这是…
Well, I appreciate it, man. I mean, this was....

110
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,160
我欠你的 好了 我周一和你谈那件事？
I owe you. All right, I'll talk to you Monday about that thing?

111
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,360
好啊 不错 奎斯托 谢谢
Yeah. Great, Christos, thanks.

112
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,480
嘿 不介意的话 6月怎么了？
Hey. What was with June, if you don't mind me asking?

113
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,920
朱恩·梅嫩德斯是我妻子的护理员
June Menendez was my wife's nurse.

114
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
照顾了她15年
Took care of her for 15 years.

115
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,320
这其中的10年 我爱着她
For 10 of those years, I was in love with her.

116
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,720
我感到很愧疚 所以我不能告诉任何人
And I felt so guilty I couldn't tell anybody.

117
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,640
除了朱恩自己
Least of all June herself.

118
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,800
知道了
Right.

119
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,720
好了 再见
All right, I'll see you.

120
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,080
我们可能走了半英里…
We might have gone about half a mile...

121
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,120
…我口袋里的手帕都湿了…
...and my pocket handkerchief was quite wet through...

122
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,960
我看见佩戈蒂从篱笆里冲出来
...when looking out, to my amazement, I saw Peggotty burst from a hedge.

123
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,840
她跳进车 没说一句话
She jumped up into the carriage. Not a single word did she speak.

124
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,400
她一直挤 直到压上了我的鼻子 真疼…
She squeezed me until the pressure on my nose was extremely painful...

125
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,320
…把几块蛋糕放在我的口袋里…
...crammed some pieces of cake into my pockets..

126
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,360
…还往我手里放了一个钱包
...and a purse, which she put into my hand.

127
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,200
然后她跳下车跑了
Then she got down and ran away.

128
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,720
当时 我发现她的扣子滚落到了地上
Presently, I noticed one of her buttons rolling around on the floor.

129
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,280
我把它捡起来 珍藏了好长时间
I picked it up and treasured it as a keepsake for a long time.

130
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,680
好了 你们俩 不错
Okay, you two. Yeah.

131
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,800
哦 很可爱 再来 小家伙 你们谁是老大？
Oh, lovely. Come on, you guys. Which one of you two is the oldest?

132
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,160
- 大12分钟 - 真的吗？你们知道吗 我想我知道了
- Twelve minutes. - Really? Do you know, I think I could tell.

00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,880
西里尔-吉格纳德正在为您报道
Cyril Guignard reporting.

269
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,560
在我们西方 我们可以轻易批评第三世界的工作条件
Here in the West, it's easy to criticize Third World labor practices

270
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,520
但事实是…
But the truth is..

271
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,720
…这些工厂…
...these factories..

272
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,480
…在工业生产中和带动贫困国家经济上…
...play a vital role in industrial development...

273
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,320
…起着至关重要的作用
...and evolution of poorer countries.

274
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,360
让我们来弄清事实 我们所给予的工资…
And let's be clear about this, the wages we are paying...

275
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,040
…是绝对要高于当地工资标准的
...are substantially higher than local wages.

276
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,920
玛丽 反驳他！
Marie, go at him!

277
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,320
玛丽 能听见我吗？
Marie, do you hear me?

278
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,800
批判他！
pull this guy apart!

279
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,800
听见了吗 将死他！
You hear me, get him!

280
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:35,000
但这貌似正当的理由 会让法国消费者们满意吗…
But will this kind of justification satisfy French customers...

281
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,040
…贝尔彻先生？
...Mr. Belcher?

282
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,480
假如他们意识到 衣服是在什么条件下制作出来的话
If they were aware of the conditions under which the clothes are produced...

283
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,080
…你认为他们还会盈利吗？
...do you think you would still be profitable?

284
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,920
- 去看看 你就会知道有多少人需要我们了 - 感谢你的到来
Go there and you'll see how much these people need us.

285
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,160
谢谢观看
Thank you for watching.

286
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,560
今天就报道到这里 下周再见
That's all for now, see you next week.

287
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,600
抱歉 那真是不可饶恕
I'm sorry, that was unforgivable.

288
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,000
我们会重新剪辑 没人会注意到
We'll fix it in the edit. No one will notice.

289
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,800
是我的错
And it was my fault.

290
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,960
访谈一位警觉性极高的首席执行官 是一个艰难的开端
A defensive CEO was a tough start for the new season.

291
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,080
- 你想吃点什么吗？ - 不用了
- Do you want to get something to eat? - No.

292
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,992
- 真的？ - 嗯

293
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,720
好的 那明天见
I'll see you tomorrow.

294
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,680
我感觉我身上发生了什么事
I think something happened to me out there.

295
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,840
你大难不死
You had a close call.

296
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,120
不是 我觉得真的有点不对劲
No, something really happened to me.

297
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,680
当我溺水的时候…
When I went underwater...

298
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,760
…我看到了一些影像
...I had visions.

299
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,000
我不知道
I don't know.

300
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,360
你得了脑震荡 头部受到撞击
You had a concussion. You hit your head.

301
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,720
嗯？
Hm?

302
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,640
你说得对
You're right.

303
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,600
两家右派报纸报道了印度锡克教徒在街上游行…
Two right-wing newspapers claim Sikhs were out in the streets...

304
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,400
…焚烧车辆 抢劫商店
...burning cars, looting shops.

305
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:23,120
还有人说骚乱是由民主党派暗地里策划的…
Others say the unrest was triggered by elements within the nationalist parties...

306
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,560
…用来加剧对少数民族的仇视
...to cast negative suspicion on racial minorities.

307
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,160
对于印度锡克教徒这件事 你们怎么看？
What do you think about the story on the Sikhs?

308
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,600
什么？
What?

309
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,440
关于印度锡克教徒的事 你怎么看？
The story on the Sikhs, what do you think?

310
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,240
那很好
It's very good.

311
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,360
听着 我得熬夜来完成工作了
Listen, I've got to work late and finish some things.

312
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,800
好 明天见
See you tomorrow.

313
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,800
我能说一句吗…
Can I say something...

314
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,440
…也许话有点难听？
...you might find difficult to hear?

315
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,760
我认为你回来工作有点早了
I think you came back to work too soon.

316
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,360
生理上 你没有问题 但自从那次意外发生之后…
physically, you're fine. But since the accident....

317
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,320
休息一段时间恢复一下 忘掉那次意外
Take some time off to get over what happened.

318
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,280
休息几周
Just a couple of weeks.

319
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,720
"熬过去"？
To "get over"?

320
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,960
你总说你想写点什么
You've always said you wanted to write.

321
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,080
你书的构思 米歇尔会为之欢呼雀跃 会给你个好价钱
Your book idea, Michel would jump on it and pay good money.

322
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,160
但那会花费很多时间
But that would take time.

323
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,840
这里的职位会一直为你留着
This will all be here waiting for you.

324
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,360
重要的是你得好起来
What matters is that you feel better.

325
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,280
我们十分需要你
We need you too much.

326
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,640
我会考虑的
I'll think about it.

327
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,320

Yeah, well, they were in there all afternoon.

331
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,640
开始有点让你相信那些流言了 对吧？
Kind of makes you think the rumors are true, huh?

332
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,320
什么流言？
What rumor?

333
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:26,040
他们会裁掉30％的员工 你听说过的 对吧？
That they're gonna let 30 percent of the workforce go. You heard that, right?

334
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,960
是的 对 对
Yeah, right. Right.

335

336
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,640
没事 只是昨晚睡眠不足
No, I just didn't get a lot of sleep last night.

337
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,480

- 好 回见  - 好
- Yeah, yeah. I'll see you. - Yeah.

339
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,040

Down the end of the hall, on your left. Hi there.

...so one of the first things I want to do today is to pair you all up.

346
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,120

All right? Don't be shy. Grab a partner.

不知为什么道路封闭了…
The roads were closed for some reason...

353
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:58,080
而且注册的那个混蛋 花了很长时间才处理完我的申请
...plus this jerk in registration took an age processing my application.

354
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,480
我是不是来得太晚了？

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,600
再来点音乐
And some music.

370
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:53,200
因为烹饪就是一项感官运动 对吧？嗅觉 视觉 还有听觉
Because cooking is all the senses, right? The nose, the eyes, the palate and the ears.

371
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,600
今晚 我们先从最基础的开始学起

博大精深的意大利厨艺的基础…

373
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,800
…就是托斯卡纳经典的番茄沙司
...the classic tomato sauce from Toscana.

374
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,880
做准备工作 我们需要切番茄 那么开始切吧
And in preparation, we're gonna need chopped tomatoes, so let's get chopping.

375

Ah, the music. Is this beautiful?

377
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,000
天啊 有些人真的很厉害
God, some of them are really good.

378
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,680
你第一次做饭？

I read in the brochure that the course builds to a competition.

381
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,280

I saw that. To be judged by a local restaurant critic.

382
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,320
是的 我想我们就不用报以希望了 呵呵
Yeah. I don't think we should get our hopes up. Heh, heh.

383
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,800
哦 我们还有10周的时间呢
Well, we still have 10 weeks.

384
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,200
- 对 没错  - 而且我们现在还没有切到手
- Well, that's true. - And we haven't cut our fingers off yet.

385
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,640
说得没错
That's a good attitude.

386
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,280
我们俩谁用错刀子了？我吗？
Which one of us is using the wrong knife? Am I using the wrong knife?

387
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,680
对 你应该用那个
Yeah. You're using that.

388
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,080
我旁边那个大妈自己带着刀子来的
The woman next to me brought her own knife.

389
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,560

希腊人 50来岁 他的妻子死了
The Greek guy, mid-fifties, who lost his wife.

396

I believe you recently did a reading for him.

397
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,200
- 我正想阻止你  - 坎迪斯

398
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,640
好的 坎迪斯 我再也不通灵了
Okay, Candace, I don't do readings anymore.

399
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,200
你上周为安德鲁先生做了一次
You did one last week for Mr. Andreou.

400
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,080
他是我哥哥的朋友 那次是特例
He's an associate of my brother's. It was a one-time thing.

401
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,760
拜托 我向你保证 我不会告诉别人的
please, I give you my word. I won't tell anyone.

402
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,600
- 抱歉   - 听着 听着 听着 我带钱过来了
- I'm sorry. - Listen, listen, listen. I brought money.

403
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,840
- 我不要你的钱   - 要什么都可以
- I don't want your money. - Everything I have.

404
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,840
我失去了我的孩子
I lost my child.

405
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,240
我唯一的孩子 她还是个婴儿
My only child. Just a baby.

406
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,960
我只想跟她说说话
I just wanna talk to her.

407
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,880
求你了 我想和我的孩子说话
please, I wanna talk to my baby.

408
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,640
我帮不了你 我再也不做了！
I can't help you. I don't do that anymore!

409
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,200
- 拜托！  - 洛里根先生！我有钱！
- please! - Mr. Lonegan! I got money!

410
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,760
洛里根先生 求求你
Mr. Lonegan. please.

411
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,160
我想和我的孩子说话
I wanna talk to my baby.

412
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,480
上啊 姑娘们！很好！踢！
Go, girls! There you go! Kick it!

413
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,000
又有个人来找我通灵
So another person came to see me for a reading.

414
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,000
都是你朋友安德鲁干的好事
Thanks to your friend Mr. Andreou.

415
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,920
- 什么？- 没错
- What? - Yeah.

416
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,800
我告诉过那个希腊佬要守口如瓶
Told that Greek jerk to keep his big mouth shut.

417
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,600
上啊 姑娘们！踢回去！踢回去呀！
Go, girls! Kick it back! You gotta kick it back!

418
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,160
很显然他没有
Well, obviously he didn't.

419
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,680
我会跟他说的 确保不会再发生这种事
I'll talk with him, make sure nothing like that ever happens again.

420
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,320
好
Okay.

421
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,480
后来呢？
And?

422
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,960
- 后来什么？- 你帮她了吗？
- And what? - Did you do it?

423
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,080
- 什么？  - 通灵？
- What? - The reading.

424
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,160
- 你帮她通灵了吗？  - 你还是不明白 是吧？
- Did you do the reading? - You still don't get it, do you?

425
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,160
你以为就因为我能靠这个挣钱…
You think just because I can make money doing this...

426
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,080
…就因为我会 我就应该做？
...just because I can that I should do it.

427
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,960
是啊 我真这么想
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

428
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,680
我还觉得你有这个义务 因为你有天分
I also think you have a duty to do it because you have a gift.

429
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,320
这不是天分 比利 是诅咒
It's not a gift, Billy. It's a curse.

430
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,880
你完全不懂 它毁掉了我所有能过正常生活的机会
You have no idea. It ruins any chance I have at a normal life.

431
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,080
就像个怪物
Feel like a freak.

432
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,920
怪物？
Freak?

433
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,080
不管像不像怪物 乔治 这就是你
Freak or not, Georgie, it's who you are.

434
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,320
这就是你 你不能永远逃避下去
It's what you are, you know. You can't run from that forever.

435
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,080
为了让他的思绪离开那哀伤的话题…
To divert his thoughts from this melancholy subject...

436
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,800
…我告诉迈卡赫先生 我需要他帮我做一杯潘趣酒…
...I informed Mr. Micawher that I relied on him for a bowl of punch...

437
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,040
…并带他找到柠檬
...and led him to the lemons

438
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,720
他近来那消沉的意气 虽说不上是绝望 但也在刹那间消逝了
His recent despondency, not to say despair, was gone in a moment.

439
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,760
我从没见过一个如此自得其乐的人…
I never saw a man so thoroughly enjoy himself...

440
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:36,400
煮沸的朗姆酒的香气里…
...amid the fragrance of lemon peel and sugar, and the smell of burning rum...

441
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,360
…他在搅拌 调酒和品尝的时候…
...as he stirred and mixed and tasted...

442
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,200
…就仿佛他在做的 不是潘趣酒…
...and looked as if he were making, instead of punch...

443
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,680
…而是一份将永传于后世的家族财富
...a fortune for his family to last for all posterity.

444
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,040
死亡不是终点 仅仅是个开始
Death is not final. It is merely the beginning.

445
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,200
通往映射出我们在这世所为的后世
Gateway to an afterlife that reflects our conduct here on earth.

446
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:11,200
上帝 以其无上的慷慨 创造了天堂…
God, in his infinite generosity, has created heaven...

447
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,920
…如今杰森便在那里…
...which is where Jason is now...

448
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:17,680
…看着我们 身旁站满了天使和圣徒
...surrounded by all the angels and saints, looking down at us.

449
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:24,160
我们将杰森的遗体归为尘土 他的灵魂将永栖主怀
And so we commit Jason's body to dust, his soul already in God's care.

450
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,560
杰森的骨灰会从后门送出去…
Jason's ashes will be available at the back...

451
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,840
…但你不介意的话 我希望你从前门出去
...but if you wouldn't mind, I'd like you to leave through the front door.

452
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,440
早上好
Morning.

453
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,640
请进
please come in.

454
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,760
谢谢
Thank you.

455
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,720
早上好
Morning.

456
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,200
晚安 贾斯
Good night, Jase.

457
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,360
不会一直这样 只是短期这样安排
It won't be for long. It's a short-term placement.

458
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,160
直到你妈妈好起来
Just until your mum feels better.

459
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:13,480
我们在考虑的那对夫妇很有经验 而且就住你家附近
The couple we have in mind have a lot of experience and live close to where you live.

460
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,360
当然你也就不用转学了
Of course you'll stay at the same school.

461
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,480
我不想跟别人走
I don't wanna go with anyone else.

462
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,600
我想和你在一起
I wanna stay with you.

463
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,800
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

464
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,640
让我们单独呆一会 好吗？
Just give us a minute, will you?

465
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,160
听着 我需要一点时间整理自己
Look, I need a little time to sort myself out.

466
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,440
但我保证 我不会逃跑
But I'm not running away, I promise.

467
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,040
我现在可以和你在一起 我也很想这样
I could stay with you now, and I want that so much.

468
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:12,240
但我有可能做不到 因为我还不够强大
But chances are I wouldn't make it, because I'm not strong enough.

469
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,120
我不奢望你能理解
I don't expect you to understand.

470
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,400
我知道我现在丢下你…
And I know for me to leave you now...

471
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,800
…肯定会觉得做了世上最坏的事情
...it must feel like the worst thing in the world.

472
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,080
但我向你保证不会让你失望 好吗？
But I promise you I'm not gonna let you down, okay?

473
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,840
我向你保证
I promise you.

474
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,160
真的对不起
I'm so sorry.

475
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,320
我爱你 来
I love you. Come here.

476
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,200
过来
Come here.

477
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,560
要乖乖的
Be a good boy.

478
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,040
走吧
Come on.

479
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,280
通观战后的法国历史 只有两个像样的政治家
Summing up France's postwar history, only two statesmen counted:

480
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,080
戴高乐和他
De Gaulle and him.

481
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:20,120
戴高乐所有的事情都被写过了 而密特朗希望能由我来完成
On de Gaulle, everything's been written. On Mitterrand, I want to finish the job.

482
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,000
他身上有很多引人注目的元素
There are fascinating elements.

483
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,400
废除死刑 加入欧盟
The abolition of the death penalty, the European Union.

484
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,920
生于右翼分子家庭 却领导着左翼党派
Coming from a right-wing family, he seduced the left.

485
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,080
更重要的是 使他们信奉自由主义
And what's more, converted it to liberalism.

486
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,560
了不起！简直是场革命 对不对？
Amazing! It was a revolution, right?

487
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,720
再加上他从未被发现的性格上的阴暗面
plus the darker sides of his character that have never been explored.

488
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,800
他已经死了10年 时机正好 我们可以深入挖掘
He's been dead for 10 years. The timing is right, we can dig deeper.

489
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,400
我想潜入他的过去
I want to dig into his past.

490
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,560
维希 ELF石油公司的丑闻… 他扮演着什么角色？
Vichy, the Elf scandal.... What part did he play?

491
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,640
台湾护卫舰事件 巴芃丑闻…
The Taiwan frigates, the papon scandal...

492
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,240
…玛莎琳 玛格丽特·杜拉斯
...Mazarine, Marguerite Duras.

493
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,560
这些从没有被真正报道过 它们都被埋没了
These stories were never really addressed. They've all been buried.

494
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,120
我要找出那些知情者 那些未曾开口的人
I'm going to tell who knew, who didn't talk.

495
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,080
这会不会给我们带来太多争议？
Isn't that going to bring us too much controversy?

496
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,880
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

497
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,560
我想要的是一本人人都能看的书
What I want is a book that can be read by all.

498
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,520
密特朗不仅仅是个政治家
Mitterrand was not just a politician.

499
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,080
密特朗是一尊圣像
Mitterrand was an icon.

500
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,160
他是我们的叔叔 （法国人对前总统密特朗的昵称！）
He's "Tonton," our uncle!

501
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,560
也许我们该用这个做标题！
Maybe that's what we should use as the title!

502
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,200
- 叔叔  - 哈哈哈
- Tonton. - Heh, heh, heh.

503
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,880
我不确定真可以用这个标题
I'm not sure we can keep that title.

504
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,040
当然不行 我开玩笑的
Of course not. It was a joke.

505
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,760
欢迎大家就标题多给我些建议
I'll welcome your suggestions for the title.

506
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,800
"揭秘神话"或"摇摆的雕像"怎么样
How about Chipping Away at the Myth or The Vacillating Statue?

507
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,440
我很期待你们的建议
I look forward to your suggestions.

508
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,640
我们会列个单子
We'll make a list.

509
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,600
恭喜你
Congratulations.

510
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,000
这个时机再好不过了
The timing couldn't be better.

511
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,200
目前没什么政治事件
politically, there's nothing going on now anyway.

512
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:57,640
你终于可以写一本你一直想写的书了 也可以休息一下
You'll write the book you've always wanted to. You'll get some rest.

513
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,760
等到夏天 你再回到主播位置时…
Come this summer, you'll be back on the air...

514
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,480
…头顶着畅销书作家的光环 带着份薪水丰厚的新合同
...with a bestseller under your belt, and a big renegotiated contract.

515
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,320
比任何时候都要强大
Stronger than ever.

516
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,640
没错
Exactly.

517
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,240
适应灾难 将它变成你的优势
Adapting and turning misfortune to your advantage.

518
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,360
这就是我一直喜欢你的地方 从不做受害者
That's what I've always loved about you, never a victim.

519
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,880
说的对
That's right.

520
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:22,120
从不做受害者 从不脆弱 从不抱怨
Never a victim, never vulnerable, never complains.

521
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,680
打扰一下 有你们的位子了
Excuse me. Your table is ready.

522
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,640
太好了 我饿了
Great. I'm starving.

523
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,840
我能问你个问题吗？
Can I ask you something?

524
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,880
你觉得我们死了会怎么样？
What do you think happens when we die?

525
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,520
这问题好奇怪！
That's a strange question!

526
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,040
回答我
Tell me.

527
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,000
死了就是死了 灯光暗去 就这样
When you die, you die. The lights go out, that's it.

528
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,560
怎么了？
Why?

529
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,600
就那样？只是灯熄了？
That's it? Just blackout?

530
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,880
一片漆黑 插头被拔掉了
Totally black, the plug's pulled out.

531
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,400
永恒的虚无
The eternal void.

532
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:02,200
你不觉得可能会有什么东西吗？
Don't you think it's possible that there is something?

533
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,720
什么东西？
Like what?

534
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,320
我也不知道 像是…
I don't know, something....

535
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,240
来世
A hereafter.

536
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,240
不 我不觉得
No, I don't.

537
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,120
要真是这样 应该已经有人发现了吧？
If that were the case, wouldn't someone have discovered it by now?

538
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,320
肯定也会有证据
And there would be proof.

539
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,320
也许吧
I guess.

540
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,640
你有很多这种问题吗？
Do you have a lot of questions like that?

541
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,920
再来点香槟？
More champagne?

542
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,160
啊？
Huh?

543
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:32,080
好 每个人都戴上眼罩了吗？
Okay, does everyone have their blindfolds on?

544
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
很好
Okay.

545
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:38,200
想做一个好的厨师 首先就要锻炼你的味觉
Now, if you wanna be a good cook, first we need to work on your palate.

546
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,920
激发你的想象 你的感官
To stimulate your imaginations, your senses.

547
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:46,320
如果不能根据味道 说出食物的名字 颜色 乃至形状
No good being an expert chopper, dicer, roaster, toaster...

548
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,280
…刀工和烤技再好 也于事无补
...if you can't give names and colors, and even shapes, to flavors.

549
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,160
好了 现在 第一勺
Okay. Now, spoon number one.

550
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:00,600
听着 这并不容易 无法立刻尝出来也不用担心
Now, look, this isn't easy. So don't worry if you don't immediately identify it.

551
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,360
可以先描述一下
Let's start by trying to describe it.

552
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,880
什么口感？
What is the texture?

553
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,120
准备好了吗？
Okay, you ready?

554
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,920
- 浓度如何？- 张嘴
- What is the consistency? - Open.

555
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,480
非常好
Very good.

556
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,200
怎么了？
What?

557
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,840
我完全不知道这是什么
I have no freaking idea what this is.

558
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,440
"完全不知道" 好的
"No freaking idea." Okay.

559
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,400
不过 嗯…
But, um....

560
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,840
不是水果
It's not a fruit.

561
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,120
有点像坚果
It's kind of nutty.

562
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:42,760
- 还有点甜 我觉得  - 好
- But it's kind of sweet too. I think. - Okay.

563
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,000
"有点像坚果"
"A little nutty."

564
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,960
"有点甜"
"Kind of sweet."

565
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,000
- 她猜到了吗？- 猜到了
- Did she get it? - Yeah.

566
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,440
那我们怎么办？
So how are we gonna do this?

567
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,680
什么？
What?

568
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:59,280
我们可以先废话一箩筐 也可以…
Well, we could make up a whole load of crap, or we could...

569
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,920
…开门见山 坦诚以对
...cut to the chase and be honest with one another.

570
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,440
坦诚什么？
About?

571
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:07,160
坦诚我们为什么要上夜校？
About why we're both doing night-school classes?

572
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,440
- 好   - 张嘴
- All right. - Open.

573
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,800
都还好吗？怎么样？
Everybody okay? How we doing?

574
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,520
嗯
Mm.

575
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,240
这个 嗯…
There's, um....

576
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,240
味道不错
There's something oaky about that.

577
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,400
"不错" 好
"Oaky." Okay.

578
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:29,080
- 对 肉豆蔻？好像是  - 好
- Yeah. Nutmeggy? I think. - Okay.

579
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,680
你不会说是因为你想做出…
You're not gonna tell me it's because you wanna make...

580
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,480
…最完美的蛤蜊意大利面吧？
...the perfect spaghetti vongole, right?

581
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,800
不 不完全是
No, not entirely.

582
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,640
好吧 我先来
Okay. I'll jump in.

583
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:48,720
我来夜校是因为我刚到旧金山
I'm doing this because I'm new to San Francisco.

584
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,680
想认识一些新朋友
Because I'm looking to make new friends.

585
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:58,560
谁知道呢？幸运的话 也许能碰见我的白马王子
And who knows? If I'm lucky, maybe even meet the man of my dreams.

586
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,760
- 来 张嘴   - 好
- Here, open. - Okay.

587
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,160
你为什么来旧金山？
So why'd you move to San Francisco?

588
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,960
呃…
Uh....

589
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,560
因为我在匹兹堡被人甩了
Because I got dumped by someone in pittsburgh.

590
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,280
对不起
Sorry.

591
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:31,360
熟饭还没煮成 不过就差一点
Not quite at the aisle, but pretty close.

592
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:36,760
支付了婚纱首付款 订了蜜月 就那些
Down payment on the wedding dress, honeymoon booked. That kind of thing.

593
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,840
我是说 没关系 我…
I mean, it's okay. You know, I'm....

594
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,520
我已经好了 快好了
I'm over it, just about.

595
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,320
其实 根本没有
Not at all, actually.

596
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,080
那个什么味道？
What'd that taste like?

597
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,560
哦 嗯…
Oh. Um....

598
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,320
我不知道
I don't know.

599
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:05,280
我 我真的…我不…
I mean, I really... I don't....

600
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,760
- 再尝一次？  - 好
- Wanna try again? - Yeah, okay.

601
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,280
好的
Okay.

602
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,760
- 准备好了？ - 嗯哼
- Ready? - Uh-huh.

603
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,480
好
Okay.

604
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,960
- 是豆子吗？ - 对
- Is that a bean? - Yeah.

605
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,880
- 真的？  - 是 嗯
- Really? - Yeah.

606
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,480
猜是什么颜色的豆子？
You know what color it is?

607
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,240
有点像…
It's like....

608
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,120
味道像是黑豆
Tastes like a black bean.

609
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,240
- 猜对了吗？- 对
- Am I right? - Yes.

610
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,080
进行的怎么样？别怕丑
How we doing? Don't be shy.

611
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,560
- 开始   - 嗯 有点…
- Here we go. - Oh, well...

612
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:05,640
…就像你 我的生活最近改变很大…
...like you, I recently made a big change to my life...

613
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:13,640
…我得重新考虑很多事 调整一些首要的事
...and I just wanted to reevaluate things and change my priorities.

614
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,240
那是…？都有哪些改变？
What was...? What was the change?

615
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,640
离婚或者…？
Divorce or...?

616
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,800
噢 不 不是 不是那些 不
Oh, no, no, nothing like that. No.

617
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:26,640
稍后再考虑工作的事
A job that I needed to put behind me.

618
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
因为工作 没能好好享受生活
It was making any kind of life impossible.

619
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,200
傻子一个
Definitely a nut.

620
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,320
你不打算告诉我 就是 你做哪行？
You're not gonna tell me, you know, what the job was?

621
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,960
如果我不说你介意吗？
Would you mind if I didn't?

622
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,480
我想说 别担心 我不是罪犯也不做犯法的事
I mean, don't worry, I wasn't like a criminal or anything.

623
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,760
- 好吧 张嘴  - 好
- Okay. So open up. - Okay.

624
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,040

625
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,680

- Wasn't that great? - Yeah, fun.

627
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,360
天啊 弄得我饿死了
God, it's made me so hungry.

628
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,600
嗯 我也是
Yeah, me too.

629
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,000
吃点东西吧？
Do you wanna get something to eat?

630
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:13,360
好 这附近有一家人人都赞不绝口的餐厅
Yeah. There's actually a place nearby that everyone's talking about.

631
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:18,000
附近的餐厅 你跟我开玩笑吗？我们可是专业大厨呢

00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,360
- 我来开车  - 好 嗯 好的 那很棒 好的
- I can drive. - Yeah. Oh, yeah, great, okay.

这是谁？
Who's this?

647
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,560
是你们的祖先吗？
Is this some kind of ancestor?

648
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,080
不 那是查尔斯·狄更斯
No, that's Charles Dickens.

649
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,880
- 噢  - 我是他的粉丝 忠实粉丝
- Oh. - I'm a fan. I'm a huge fan.

650
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:35,480
你知道 人们追逐莎士比亚 这是…
You know, people go on and on about Shakespeare and it's...

651
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:38,080
我的意思是 他很棒 当然 不过狄更斯…
I mean, he's great, of course, but Dickens....

652
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,040
不 不要 我来拿 我来拿
No, no, I'll get that. I got it.

653
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:45,040
这需要…这需要点技巧
There's a... There's a little trick.

654
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,000
嘿 是比利
Hey. It's Billy.

655
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,280
告诉你一声 我碰到那个希腊人了
Just to say I finally caught up with our Greek friend.

656
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,640
让他别到处说
Told him to keep his mouth shut. Okay?

657
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,240
别紧张 不会再有那种怪胎…
Just relax. There shouldn't be any more freaks..

658
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,960
…敲你家门要求通灵 你知道了吗？
...knocking on your door asking for readings, you know?

659
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,480
我必须得说 这家伙…
I gotta say though, this guy...

660
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,520
…他称赞你如何如何出色…
...he made a big point of saying how brilliant you were...

661
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,840
…现在到处是假的通灵师 居然真的有人拥有这种才能
...and with so many fakers out there, someone who had a genuine gift.

662
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,040
我也不知道…
I don't know...

663
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,480
不好意思
Sorry about that.

664
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,880
嗯…
Uh....

665
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,880
- 什么才能？  - 噢 没什么 不用管它
- What gift? - Oh, nothing. Don't worry about it.

666
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,200
不 我是说 我很感兴趣
No, I mean, I'm interested.

667
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:28,040
好吧 我以前做过的工作 通灵师
Well, the job I had before, it was as a psychic.

668
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,920
我知道 但是…
I know, but....

669
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,560
- 什么？ - 但是 这是真的
- What? - But it's true.

670
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,480
我小时候得了场病…
I had an illness as a child...

671
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,840
…感染了 然后转成发烧…
...and I had an infection, which turned into a fever...

672
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,520
…我的大脑和脊髓都发炎了
...which turned into inflammation of my brain and spinal cord.

673
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,640
这病称为脑脊髓炎
It's called encephalomyelitis.

674
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:53,360
没办法只能动手术 在后背 这儿
And they had to operate, in the back, here.

675
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:59,280
是个很复杂的手术 花了8小时 我差点就死了
It was a complicated procedure. It was eight hours. And they nearly lost me.

676
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,280
事实上 从技术上来说 他们并没有把我一次救成功…
Actually, technically, they did lose me...

677
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,440
…又做了几次手术后才把我救活
...and bring me back on a number of occasions.

678
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,560
不管怎么样 他们治好了我的病…
Anyway, they cured the illness...

679
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:14,560
…但是在他们回到那里时一定是混淆了其它什么 因为…
...but they must've messed up something else while they were back there, because...

680
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,360
…不久之后 我开始偏头痛
...not long after, I started to have these migraines.

681
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:20,120
紧接着做噩梦
And then nightmares.

682
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:25,360
然后就能通灵了
And then these connections.

683
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:31,840
一天我和朋友坐着 然后我看见一个女人的影像…
And one day I'm sitting with a friend, and I had a vision of a woman...

684
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,680
…水晶般透明的影像
...a crystal-clear vision.

685
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,320
然后我向我朋友描述她
And I described her to him.

686
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,680
结果描述的正是他母亲 我从没见过他母亲…
And turned out it was an exact description of his mother, someone I'd never met...

687
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:46,080
…她上周刚过世
...who'd died the previous week.

688
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,880
你别笑我
And you're not laughing yet.

689
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,640
不 我不会
No, I'm not.

690
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:56,360
嗯 不管怎么样 我觉得那一定是某种巧合
Well, anyway, I assumed it was some kind of a coincidence.

691
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:01,880
随着时间推移 我不断看到更多影像
But as time went on, I began having more and more of these things, connections.

692
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:06,240
医生给我做了很多测试
So the doctors ran a bunch of tests.

693
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:10,120
医生跟我父母说我患有被动精神分裂症
They told my parents that I'd developed something called passive schizophrenia.

694
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:14,440
医生给了我一堆药 那些防止我看到影像的药…
They gave me a bunch of pills and, you know, the pills stopped the visions...

695
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,600
…那些药把我的生活都搅乱了…
...but they pretty much stopped everything else also...

696
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,440
…所以没得选择
...so I had this choice.

697
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:23,600
要么带着这些很显然没法停止的幻觉…
I was either gonna live my life with these hallucinations...

698
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,160
…活着
...with apparently no way of switching it off.

699
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:30,120
要么死去
Or I could have no life at all.

700
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,120
噢 我的天啊
Oh, my God.

701
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,480
所以 我正在无视我的职责
See, there, now I've been neglecting my duties.

702
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:41,520
能问你个问题吗？
Could I ask you a question?

703
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,400
知道吗 这些能下锅了
You know, these are probably ready to go in.

704
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,120
乔治？
George?

705
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,440
如果我的答案是"不" 你会介意吗？
Would it be okay if I told you the answer was no?

706
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,800
你都不知道我要问什么
You don't even know what I was gonna ask.

707
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,440
是 我知道 你想问我能不能帮你通灵
Yes, I do. You're gonna ask me if I can do a reading for you.

708
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,480
听着 梅拉尼 我不了解你…
Look, Melanie, I barely know you...

709
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,240
…但我很喜欢你
...but I like you a lot.

710
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,160
真的 非常喜欢
Really, a lot.

711
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,160
能不能让我们假装…
Is there any way we could pretend that maybe we go back in time...

712
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:18,680
…忘记那个电话 和我兄弟的留言…
...and just forget about the phone ringing, and my brother's message...

713
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,320
- …回到我们从来没有这次谈话的时刻？ - 为什么？
- ...and we never had this conversation? - Why?

714
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,480
因为如果我一旦走上这条路…
If we open the door and go down that road...

715
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,440
…我们就再也不会像普通人那样生活了
...any chance that we had of having something normal will just be gone.

716
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,440
一定会这样
It just will.

717
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:35,360
相信我 对这个我已经经历得够多了
Believe me. I have enough experience of that now.

718
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,520
我的意思是 有时 你知道…
I mean, sometimes, I mean....

719
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:43,360
就是 了解某人的任何事 就好像…
You know, knowing everything about someone, it's...

720
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:46,320
你知道 看起来是不错 但是 这感觉真的…
You know, it seems nice, but, really...

721
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,960
…也许最好适可而止
...maybe it's actually better to hold stuff back.

722
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,080
我听懂了
I hear you.

723
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:56,520
但你得理解我 我很好奇
But you can understand. I'm curious.

724
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:00,160
不 当然 我的意思是 是 我能理解
No, of course. I mean, yeah. Yeah.

725
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,080
求你了？
please?

726
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:20,080
好吧
Okay.

727
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,200
过来
Come on.

728
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,760
这边 坐下
Here, take a seat.

729
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,680
好
Okay.

730
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:38,080
接下来的几秒钟我得抓着你的手 开始通灵…
I'm gonna take your hands for a second, to get a connection...

731
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:41,480
…然后我会放开 问你几个问题
...and then I'll let go, and I'll just ask you a couple questions.

732
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:42,720
好的
All right.

733
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,240
好 把手给我
Okay. Give me your hands.

734
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,600
好
Okay.

735
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,400
好
Okay.

736
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,800
有个女人 高个子女人
There's a woman. And she's tall.

737
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,400
身材单薄 棕色头发
Thin. She has brown hair.

738
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,240
知道我在描述谁吗？
Do you know who I'm talking about?

739
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,920
她是你妈妈？
Is this woman your mother?

740
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,520
对
Yes.

741
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:21,280
我感觉胸口很疼
And I'm feeling a pain in my chest.

742
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:29,960
对 她就是这么死的 心脏病
Yeah. That's how she died. Of a heart attack.

743
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,480
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

744
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,440
好 准备吃饭吗？
Okay. You ready to eat?

745
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:42,440
没有其它什么事吗？
There's not something else?

746
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:46,000
- 没有 没什么事…  - 不 不 不 我能感觉到
- No, there's nothing... - No, no, no, I can tell.

747
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:49,000
求你了 肯定有事 我感觉到了
please, there is, I can tell.

748
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:54,120
我的意思是 怎么了？你觉得我无法处理？
I mean, what's the matter? You don't think I could handle it?

749
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,880
好吧 嗯…
All right, um....

750
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,360
你刚才碰我的时候 有一个…
When you touched me before, there was a....

751
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,760
有个男人
There was a man.

752
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,480
深色头发
Dark hair.

753
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,000
我爸爸
My father.

754
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,880
他不久前去世了？
He passed away not too long ago?

755
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,480
- 去年   - 然后…
- Last year. - And....

756
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,160
他不停地说 所有我能听到的就是…
All he kept saying, all I kept hearing was...

757
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,440
是什么？
Was what?

758
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,560
他非常抱歉
How sorry he was.

759
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,480
抱歉什么？
What for?

760
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:41,320
为他过去对你的所作所为
For what he did to you all that time ago.

761
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:50,840
他希望有朝一日你能原谅他
And he hoped that you could one day forgive him.

762
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,920
对不起
I'm sorry.

763
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:02,880
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

764
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,000
对不起
I'm sorry...

765
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,520
…把你逼成这样
...for pressing you like that.

766
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:20,520
也许我们不应该到这一步
Maybe we shouldn't have gone there.

767
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
我不知道该说什么
I don't know what to say.

768
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,320
除非如果我…
Except if I....

769
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:36,880
如果我现在走…
If I go now...

770
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:41,520
…如果我到此为止闭口不谈…
...if we draw a line under this...

771
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,400
…假装这些从没发生过…
...pretend it never happened...

772
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,240
…我们会没事吧
...we'll be okay.

773
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,840
我确定
I'm sure.

774
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,080
好
Good.

775
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,520
好
Good.

776
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:15,160
我们还得赢比赛 对吧？
We still have the competition to win. Right?

777
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,960
对
Right.

778
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,280
我当时应该听你的
I should've listened to you.

779
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,800
你知道 有太多关于通灵的认知和所有这些…
You know, too much knowledge and all that.

780
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,080
下周见
I'll see you next week.

781
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,800
当然 那还用说
Yeah, you betcha.

782
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:50,920
那些过去曾一度在我生活中蔓延的痛苦感觉
MAN The old, unhappy feeling that had once pervaded my life...

783
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:57,320
…像个不速之客般归来 比以往更强烈
...came back like an unwelcome visitor, and deeper than ever.

784
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:01,680
压在我心头像一支悲伤压抑的乐曲…
It addressed me like a strain of sorrowful music...

785
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:06,240
…一种我曾失去一切的绝望意识…
...a hopeless consciousness of all that I had lost...

786
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,160
…所有那些我曾经爱过的
...all that I had ever loved.

787
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:14,880
残留的不过是毁灭后的苍白和荒芜…
And all that remained was a ruined blank and waste...

788
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:20,520
…围绕着我 未冲破那黑暗的地平线
...lying around me, unbroken to the dark horizon.

789
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,480
好了 儿子 下车拿着这个
All right, son, out you get.

790
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:29,400
好了 小可爱 谢谢
All right. Lovely, thanks.

791
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:34,040
- 你好  - 嘿 马克斯！
- Hello. - Hi, Marcus!

792
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:36,760
嘿 我是安吉拉 这是丹尼斯
Hi. I'm Angela. This is Dennis.

793
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,480
你好吗？小伙子
All right, mate?

794
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,400
我叫他威胁者丹尼斯
I call him Dennis the Menace.

795
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:45,480
现在 我带你参观下厨房
Now, I'll show you the kitchen.

796
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,240
从这儿一直走
Just keep walking through there.

797
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,760
早上 我们在这吃早饭
So this is where we eat our breakfast in the morning.

798
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,360
你早上爱吃什么？
What do you like to eat in the mornings?

799
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:58,160
我们是这屋子里的麦片粥爱好者 你爱吃麦片粥吗？
We're porridge eaters in this house. Do you like porridge?

800
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,960
或者玉米片？
Or cornflakes?

801
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,800
这是你的房间
This is your room.

802
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,720
我们的小儿子 瑞奇 一个月前刚搬出去
Our last boy, Ricky, moved out about a month ago.

803
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,880
刚满18岁 得到了他的第一份工作-保安
Just turned 18. Got his first job, security guard.

804
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,560
来吧 小东西 这些都是你的了
Go on, mate. It's all yours now.

805
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,160
能再加一张床吗？
Do you think it's possible to get another bed?

806
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,960
等一小会 马克斯
Two secs, Marcus.

807
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:40,080
我们还需要一张床
We're gonna need another bed.

808
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,920
楼上？我能拿你的吗？
Upstairs? Should I take yours?

809
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,320
- 你没问题吧？- 没问题
- You all right? - Yeah.

810
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:43,760
晚安 贾斯
Good night, Jase.

811
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:50,400
谁同意？A和D  "欧洲花楸是古罗马语里面的花楸"
Who agrees? A and D. "Rowan is an old Roman word for a mountain ash."

812
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,320
"一种活了超过100年的花楸"
"A mountain ash lives over 100 years."

813
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:55,400
有同学有不同意见吗？
And does anybody else think it's anything else?

814
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:58,520
马克斯 你能把帽子摘了吗 拜托？
Marcus, could you take the hat off, please?

815
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:00,920
谢谢
Thank you.

816
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:04,320
那下面我们来看第6题
So now let's move on to number six.

817
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,760
在下一页
On the next page.

818
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:11,000
那么你们应该看看引言 "勇气之翼"
So you're gonna need to look at the extract, "Wings of Courage."

819
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,840
- 很感谢你们的到来  - 不客气
- Thank you very much for coming in. - You're welcome.

820
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,640
然后…
And....

821
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,600
等我们安排好会面时我们会再联系
We'll be in touch when we've made the appointment.

822
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,080
嗯 好的 很好
Yeah. Okay, great.

823
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:26,760
我们尽快把事情弄好
Let's get it sorted as soon as possible.

824
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:27,960
谢谢
Thanks.

825
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:30,240
好的 马克斯？回头见啦 小东西
All right, Marcus? See you soon, mate.

826
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,280
好好做个小男子汉
Be a good little man.

827
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:46,080
午餐时间到了 马克斯 你要去吗？
It's lunchtime, Marcus. You gonna go?

828
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:16,760
死亡天使一旦想找你…
The angel of death comes to you...

829
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:21,360
…便终会找到你 不论你藏在哪
...and will find you, no matter where you are hiding.

830
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:25,920
即使你躲得严严实实 像富人躲在城堡里…
Even if you are hiding in, like a rich man in a castle...

831
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:30,400
…上帝的使者还是能找到你的
...the angel of God will find you.

832
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,760
大家好
Hello.

833
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,720
我们中很多人可能因恐惧而不敢问
A number of us are probably too frightened to ask:

834
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,520
"我们死后会怎样呢？"
"What happens to us when we die?"

835
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:51,800
好消息是 如果你信基督教 你就可以无所畏惧了
But the good news is, if you believe in Christ, you have nothing to fear.

836
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:48,409
[此处外语字幕亦无]

837
01:16:03,409 --> 01:16:05,409
[此处外语字幕亦无]

838
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,760
抱歉 我不理解
Excuse me. I don't understand.

839
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:12,880
啊 要是知道她到底去哪了 我们能不说嘛？
Ah. What wouldn't we give to know exactly where she's gone?

840
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:16,440
但从你的信上看 或许你已经知道了
But from what you wrote in your letter, perhaps you know already.

841
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,400
- 我叫克劳迪娅·卢索   - 玛丽·勒莱
- Claudia Rousseau. - Marie Lelay.

842
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:21,640
- 见到你真高兴  - 我也是
- I'm so happy to meet you. - You too.

843
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:25,600
你知道的 我真的非常需要谈谈我看到的影像
You know, I really need to talk about the vision I had.

844
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:27,640
- 当然 来吧  - 好的
- Sure, go ahead. - Yeah.

845
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:31,440
是种非常祥和的感觉
It was a very peaceful sensation.

846
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:36,520
一切都那么安静 四下一片黑暗
Everything was quiet. Darkness everywhere.

847
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:39,720
然后有一道光吸引了我
And a light was catching my eyes.

848
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,440
而且我能听到微风吹过的声音
And I was hearing the sound of a gentle wind.

849
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,640
嗯哼
Mm-hm.

850
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,920
有种失重的感觉？
A feeling of weightlessness?

851
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:48,440
对
Yes.

852
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,160
能看到360度全景？
A 360 perspective?

853
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:54,040
感觉不到时间和物体的移动？
No sense of linear time or motion?

854
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,440
对
Yes.

855
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,360
但什么都知道 什么都有感觉？
But all-knowing, all-sensing?

856
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:58,720
正是这样
Exactly.

857
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:01,080
- 来杯茶吗？  - 谢谢
- Would you care for some tea? - Thank you.

858
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:05,280
你知道 作为一名科学家和无神论者…
You know, as a scientist and atheist...

859
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:08,240
…我打心里对那些事是抗拒的
...my mind was closed to such things.

860
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:12,040
噢 当然 死后 接近死亡的经历
Oh, absolutely. Afterlife, near-death experiences.

861
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:15,160
和每个人一样 我想人们应该会看到亮光…
Like everyone else, I thought people saw bright lights...

862
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,200
…伊甸园那样的花园什么的…
...Eden-like gardens and so forth...

863
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:21,040
…因为这是传统文化决定的
...because they were culturally conditioned to do so.

864
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:25,560
但在安养院待了25年后…
But after 25 years in a hospice...

865
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:28,920
…工作对象是一些多数已经宣告死亡…
...working with people, many of whom were pronounced dead...

866
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:32,280
…但奇迹般又活过来的人…
...but then miraculously survived...

867
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:36,920
…他们所叙述的经历是那么令人心惊地相似…
...the account of what they actually experienced were so strikingly similar...

868
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,480
…不可能是巧合
...it couldn't just be coincidence.

869
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:44,720
加之他们在经历这些的时候…
And add to that the fact that when they had these experiences...

870
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,160
…完全属于无意识状态…
...they were almost all unconscious...

871
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:52,880
…我的对手都同意那时候 大脑根本不能创造新的画面
...a state in which my enemies agree the brain cannot create fresh images.

872
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:58,080
那你认为我是真的经历了某些东西？
So you think I really did experience something?

873
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,560
噢 是的
Oh, yes.

874
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,880
我想你经历过了死亡
I think you experienced death.

875
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,560
都在这了
It's all here.

876
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:12,920
如果你的征途跟我相似的话 恐怕不是件易事啊
I'm afraid if your journey is anything like mine, it won't be an easy one.

877
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,960
这是个孤独的战场
It's a lonely field to plow.

878
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:19,360
人们面对这个话题总是很不理智 甚至很敌意
people get quite irrational around this subject. Quite hostile, even.

879
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:22,600
但这些证据是驳不倒的
But the evidence is irrefutable.

880
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,480
我努力过了
I tried.

881
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:31,920
你知道 也许像你这样的…
You know, perhaps someone like you...

882
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:36,840
…在如此地位上 有如此影响力的人 能改变它
...in your position, and with your influence, can change that.

883
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,880
我希望你可以
I hope you can.

884
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,000
谢谢
Thank you.

885
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,280
祝你好运
Good luck.

886
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,120
我弄好以后会送还给你的
I'll send it back when I'm done.

887
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:21,720
晚上好
Good evening.

888
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:25,560
维旺迪(法国一家巨型媒体跨国集团)和电力巨擎VFM发表的联合声明
Following a joint statement by Vivendi and electricity giant VFM..

889
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:28,280
…表示季利润超过预计…
...announcing higher than expected quarterly profits..

890
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:33,800
…让我们想到法国金融危机的复苏 是不是要提前到来？
...we wonder if evoking France's economic downturn might be premature?

891
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,360
来楼上一下
Like to see you upstairs.

892
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,000
乔治 请坐
George, have a seat.

893
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:14,400
你或许知道到了很多关于裁员的说法
You're probably aware there's been a lot of talk about cutbacks.

894
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,600
是啊 我听说了
Yeah, I heard.

895
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:19,680
嗯 不管怎样 看来诉讼案是工会摆平了…
Yeah. Anyway, seems the suits got together with the unions...

896
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:24,000
…还提出了对考虑主动离职人员所能得的福利
...and came up with packages for anyone willing to consider voluntary redundancy.

897
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,080
主动离职？
Voluntary redundancy?

898
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,520
听着 如果你问我 这交易很好的呀
Look, if you ask me, the deal is pretty good.

899
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:32,840
你会得到6个月的工资和2年的医保
You get six months' pay in your pocket with health insurance for two years.

900
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,360
那 这些跟我有一毛钱关系吗？
So, what does this have to do with me?

901
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,240
这真是个丑闻 你在那工作了3年吧？
It's a freaking scandal. You worked there three years?

902
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,520
没翘过一天班 从没请过病假
You never missed a day, never called in sick.

903
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,480
- 他说这不是针对个人的   - 那是英国标准
- He said it was nothing personal. - That's B.S.

904
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,320
他是想保护那些有妻儿的人
He's trying to protect the guys who have wives and kids.

905
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:55,120
- 你应该请一个律师  - 没钱请
- You should hire a lawyer. - I can't afford a lawyer.

906
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:58,280
如果你需要帮忙找新工作 我可以帮你
If you need help getting another job, I'll help you with that.

907
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:02,480
对吧？
I'll make calls. I'll make it happen. But you know what I think you should do, right?

908
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,360
嗯 我知道
Yes, I do.

909
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,600
你知道 网站还没关呢 等着你
You know, the website's still up. Waiting.

910
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,360
这次会不一样的 乔治
It'd be different this time, George.

911
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:15,880
我们可以加以控制 这样就不一样啦
We could control it. That's how it would be different.

912
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,760
我们可以一天就接2次客 最多3次 小规模接待
We'd only do two clients a day, three, tops. Keep it small.

913
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:21,800
不告诉他们你的电话号码 我们不告诉媒体
Don't give out your phone number. We won't talk to the media.

914
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,440
上次我们可吸取教训了 对吧？
We learned our lesson with that the last time, right?

915
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:29,120
考虑考虑呗 嗯？
Just think about it, all right?

916

- 做得还好吧 乔治？- 是啊

928
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,840

What happens now?

929
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,240
嗯 我们不想牵扯到警方
Well, we don't want to involve the police.

930
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:39,320
不 那是万不得己的时候才用的
No, that's really a last resort.

931
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,320
如果他回来了 告诉我们好吗？
Will you let us know if he comes back?

932
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,880
我们保持联系
We will be in touch.

933
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,320
我送你们出去
I'll see you out.

934
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,280
进来吧
There you go.

935
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:17,840
恐怕我们的通灵者 休伊特先生 他很忙的
I'm afraid our sensitive, Mr. Hewitt, is very busy.

936
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,720
他最快也得6个星期后才能见你
Earliest he could see you is six weeks' time.

937
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,240
噢 天哪
Oh, dear.

938
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,400
乔伊斯女士 我们的资深通灵者…
Mrs. Joyce, our senior sensitive...

939
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,400
…今晚要做一个公众通灵 如果你有兴趣
...is doing a public reading tonight if you're interested.

940
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,280
在演讲大厅
In the lecture hall.

941
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:32,480
好的 我会碰碰运气的 谢谢
All right. I'll try my luck. Thank you.

942
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,320
需要我帮忙吗？
Can I help you?

943
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,280
噢 不用 谢谢了
Oh, no, thanks.

944
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:42,800
我强烈的感觉到屋子里的气息
I'm getting a strong feeling over this side of the room.

945
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:47,040
某个名字以字母"J"开头的人
Someone whose name starts with a "J."

946
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:52,560
字母"J"对谁有特殊意义吗？有人吗？
Does the letter "J" mean anything to anyone? Anyone?

947
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,440
有人吗？
Anyone?

948
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,160
噢
Oh.

949
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,320
别害羞嘛
Don't be shy.

950
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,120
告诉我们你的名字 谢谢
Tell us your name, please.

951
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,320
马克斯
Marcus.

952
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:07,560
马克斯 马克斯 过来吧
Marcus. Marcus. Come on.

953
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,760
上这儿来 好让我能看见你
Come up here where I can see you.

954
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,280
好孩子
Good boy.

955
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:17,280
这是个好孩子 马克斯 没事的 我不会伤害你的
There's a good boy, Marcus. That's right. I'm not going to hurt you.

956
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,920
你真可爱
That's lovely.

957
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:24,440
那 马克斯 你最近失去了某个人
Now, Marcus, you've lost someone recently.

958
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,440
是跟你非常亲近的人吗？
Was it someone very close to you?

959
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:33,120
他正在告诉我他的名字 是乔 或者杰克
He's telling me his name. It's Joe, or Jack.

960
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,200
- 杰森  - 杰森 就这个
- Jason. - Jason, that's it.

961
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:38,640
他跟你非常亲近 不是吗？他是你的亲人吗？
He was very close to you, wasn't he? Was he part of your family?

962
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,360
是不是你爸爸？
Is it your dad?

963
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:50,000
嗯 爸爸说别伤心…
Well, Daddy says please don't be sad...

964
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:53,040
…要为他照顾好妈妈 你会的对吧？
...and to look after Mummy for him, will you?

965
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,280
你会为他这样做的 对吧？
Will you do that for him?

966
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,480
给马克斯一点掌声吧 女士们 先生们
Give Marcus a round of applause, ladies and gentlemen.

967
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:03,800
真可爱的孩子
Lovely boy.

968
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:06,440
当我进入恍惚状态…
And as I go into a trance...

969
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:11,080
…我的灵魂引导者会通过我跟你讲话
...my spirit guide will speak to you through me.

970
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:15,880
噢
Oh.

971
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:21,160
是谁把我从灵魂世界召唤来的？
Who summons me from the spirit world?

972
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:23,680
说出你的名字吧
Say your name.

973
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,520
- 马克斯  - 马克斯
- Marcus. - Marcus.

974
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:31,840
欢迎你 马克斯 我叫尧西
Welcome, Marcus. My name is Yoshi.

975
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:36,560
我正在做的是调试麦克风
What I'm doing is I'm adjusting the level of the microphones.

976
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,320
你在学校学物理吗？
Do you do physics at school?

977
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:41,600
很好 那你知道声音有着不同的振动频率
Good. Then you know that all matter vibrates at different speeds.

978
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:45,320
但在灵魂世界中 振动频率要高得多
But in the spirit world, operates at far higher levels.

979
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:48,080
所以我们听不见他们说话 起码我们肉耳听不见
So we can't hear them. Not with our normal hearing.

980
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:51,320
因此 我们所需要的是个全方位的…
So, what we really need is an omnidirectional...

981
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,280
…超心型指向电容器麦克风
...supercardioid condenser microphone.

982
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:56,320
就像这个珍宝一样
Like this beauty.

983
01:25:56,640 --> 01:26:00,360
好了 我想我们准备好了
Right. I think we are ready.

984
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:04,680
然后…
And....

985
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:12,400
杰森？你在吗？
Jason? Are you there?

986
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:19,200
你的兄弟 马克斯 在这里 有什么想对他说的吗？
Your brother, Marcus, is here. Is there a message for him?

987
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:25,200
最早是古希腊人发现这个的
It was the ancient Greeks who first discovered it.

988
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,880
他们称之为"幻镜"
"psychomanteum," they called it.

989
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:32,520
能反光的表面便是阴阳门
The reflective surface being the conduit to the afterlife.

990
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,600
如今 我们称之为"镜面注视法"
Nowadays, we call it "mirror gazing."

991
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,120
或许你没法跟他讲话 但你能看到他…
You might not be able to speak to him, but you will see him...

992
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,480
…如果你真的想的话 就这样
...if you really want to, that is.

993
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,880
你看到他了吗？
Did you see him?

994
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,400
没有
No.

995
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,880
你好 我是克莱尔
Hello. Clare speaking.

996
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:55,360
完全没他的消息 我要报警了
There's no sign of him. I'm gonna call the police.

997
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,400
- 但那样也没用的啊  - 好吧 我不在乎…
- But that will not help. - Well, I don't care what...

998
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:02,200
等等 他就在这 我回头打给你
Hang on. He's here. I'll call you right back.

999
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:07,040
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1000
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:08,520
啊…
Ah...

1001
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:10,920
由他去吧
Leave him be.

1002
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:20,480
小心！
Watch out!

1003
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:31,040
抱歉 让一下
Excuse me.

1004
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:50,120
对不起 我们有点晚了
Sorry, we are running a little late.

1005
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:51,320
请进
Come in.

1006
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:54,400
大家被这些突发事件搅得心烦意乱
Everyone is upset by the events.

1007
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:00,040
请坐
Sit down.

1008
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:06,000
玛丽 实话告诉你 我有些疑惑
Marie, to be honest with you, I'm a bit confused.

1009
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:09,080
我记得我们委托你写的是《密特朗总统传》
I thought we commissioned a book about Francois Mitterrand.

1010
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:11,840
而你给我的前三章内容是…
Instead, you give us the first three chapters of...

1011
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:13,080
…“未来:
...Hereafter:

1012
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:16,440
沉默的阴谋”
The Conspiracy of Silence.

1013
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:20,160
我知道这不是你们所期待的
I realize it's not what you were expecting.

1014
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:23,720
你总是说出版业缺少惊喜
You always said there weren't enough surprises in publishing.

1015
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:26,000
是吗 这的确是个惊喜！
Well, this is certainly a surprise!

1016
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:33,840
我不知道从何说起
I don't know where to begin.

1017
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,520
你难道不觉得我写的东西很有趣吗？
Did you at least find it interesting?

1018
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:39,480
当然有趣 你总是善于发掘好的故事
Of course. You've always had a nose for a good story.

1019
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:41,440
但我们是一个政府出版社…
But we're a political publisher...

1020
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:42,840
这是和政治有关的！
This is political!

1021
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:47,240
这种素材 再怎么吸引人也都是针对特殊市场
This kind of material, however fascinating, is for a specialized market.

1022
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:50,440
今天早晨 在伦敦 6枚炸弹于市中心爆炸
This morning, in London, six bombs went off in the heart of the city.

1023
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:55,040
显然有组织策划 炸弹是在交通高峰时段爆炸的
Apparently coordinated, the bombs exploded at the height of the rush hour.

1024
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,080
为什么你们都反对我写的东西？
Why are you all against this?

1025
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:10,640
为什么你们这么害怕？
Why are you so afraid of this?

1026
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:12,560
这才是事实！
This is real!

1027
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:15,760
这些科学证据…
This is scientific evidence...

1028
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,920
…是知名科学家被迫秘密研究得来的
...from well-known researchers forced to work in secret.

1029
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:24,080
一个诺贝尔奖得主 一直被宗教团体所困扰 这是真事
A Nobel prize winner, hounded by the religious lobby. That's a story!

1030
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:28,360
比写一个调戏女人 不老实的老政客强得多
Better than a philandering, dishonest old politician.

1031
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:32,320
但这样的书应该用英文写…
But a book like that would probably have to be written in English...

1032
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:34,240
…针对美国市场
...for the American market.

1033
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:37,160
我亲身经历过 米歇尔
It happened to me, Michel.

1034
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,920
我亲眼所见
I saw it with my own eyes.

1035
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:43,760
我们会魂归何处
Where we're going.

1036
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:47,440
以及我们会经历的事情
What we'll experience.

1037
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,200
我们中的每个人
Each and every one of us.

1038
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:55,120
这难道不吸引你吗？
That doesn't interest you?

1039
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:02,880
听者，我们委托你写的是《密特朗总统传》
Now listen, we commissioned a book about Francois Mitterrand.

1040
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:05,920
要么达成协议 你开始写我们要求的…
Either we agree on this and you start writing it...

1041
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:08,920
…要么我就把钱要回来 我就说这么多
...or else I want my money back. That's all I can say.

1042
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,360
真是丢人
It was so humiliating.

1043
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,640
他们看我的眼神就好像我是个疯子
They looked at me as if I'd lost my mind.

1044
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,600
6个月前他们祈求我随便写点什么
Six months ago they begged me to write about anything.

1045
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,920
伟大的玛丽·勒莱写的任何东西都行
Anything by the great Marie Lelay.

1046
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:50,320
你最好把我的工作还我 我受够这种羞辱了
You'd better give me my job back. I've had enough with being humiliated.

1047
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:56,000
今天 他们甚至把我的海报都换下来了
Today, they even took down my posters.

1048
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,840
为什么你没和我说这事？
Why didn't you tell me?

1049
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,400
你的书进展如何？
And your book?

1050
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:10,000
我会在空闲时间写完它 它已经让我够麻烦的了
I'll finish it in my spare time. It's caused me enough trouble as it is.

1051
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:14,520
到底怎么回事？
What's the matter?

1052
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:16,920
听着…
Look...

1053
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:19,800
…要找回你的工作…
...getting your job back...

1054
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,160
…可能没你想象的那么容易
...might not be as easy as you think.

1055
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:24,160
为什么？
Why?

1056
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:27,160
我只是申请了短假 而且是你建议的
It was a temporary break. And on your advice.

1057
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:29,000
我知道 但是…
I know, but...

1058
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:31,720
我们当时没想到…
What we couldn't have foreseen is...

1059
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:34,880
…你会公开谈论你的体验
...you'd be talking in public about these experiences.

1060
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:39,280
- 你失去了你的信誉   - 但我不想写这本书！
- That you'd lose your credibility. - But I didn't want to write this book!

1061
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:41,040
那是你的主意！
It was your idea!

1062
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,680
我的主意是让你写密特朗总统
It was my idea you should write about Mitterrand.

1063
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,520
那么 你到底要说什么？
So, what are you saying?

1064
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:50,360
我是说你再花点时间
I'm saying take some more time.

1065
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,560
完成这本书 等它出版后你解放了 再回来
Finish the book, get it out of your system, then come back.

1066
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:56,880
是那个女孩 对吧？替代我的女孩？
It's that girl, isn't it? My replacement?

1067
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,520
我见过她几次 她很漂亮
I've watched her a few times. She's good.

1068
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,520
对 她是很棒 但没你出色
Yes, she is. But not as good as you.

1069
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:06,760
你和她睡过了？
You're sleeping with her?

1070
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:09,960
你怎么能这么说？
How can you say such a thing?

1071
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:15,240
你总是告诉我要问一些尖锐的问题
You always told me to ask the tough questions.

1072
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:34,120
真有趣…
It's funny....

1073
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,400
谁能想到会变成这样？
Who'd have thought it?

1074
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,720
几个月前我很出名
A few months ago I was famous.

1075
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:44,080
也很富有
Rich.

1076
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:47,120
是个成功人士
A success story.

1077
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:50,920
那时我很快乐
I was happy.

1078
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,720
生活被工作填满
Fulfilled by my work.

1079
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:57,720
还有你
By you.

1080
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:16,240
一切的开始是因为你没有给你的孩子们买礼物
All this happened because you didn't buy your kids their gifts.

1081
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:17,880
因为什么？
Because of what?

1082
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:20,640
你在说什么？我不明白
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

1083
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:23,920
忘了吧 那无关紧要
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

1084
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:50,280
我是米歇尔
It's Michel.

1085
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:53,120
听着…
Listen....

1086
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:57,360
我对今早我们的谈话感觉很抱歉
I feel terrible about our meeting earlier today.

1087
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,720
这本书显然对你很重要
This book is obviously very important to you.

1088
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:06,880
我想今早大家对在伦敦发生的事故 有些紧张烦躁
I think everyone was a bit on edge because of the events in London.

1089
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:13,960
但之后我打了几个电话 有两个出版商对你的书感兴趣
But I made a few calls. There are two publishers who might be interested.

1090
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:16,600
一个在美国 一个在英国
One American, one English.

1091
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:18,800
你有笔吗？
Do you have a pen?

1092
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:28,040
我听着呢
I'm listening.

1093
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,240
不管怎样 我觉得这会是一间理想的团体通灵室
Anyways, I thought this would be a good group reading room.

1094
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:54,400
团体通灵？
Group reading?

1095
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:57,080
对 在这里你一次可以通灵更多人
Yeah, where you could read more people at once.

1096
01:36:57,240 --> 01:37:00,600
多到20个甚至更多 你做主 不过这样他们付的钱就少了
Up to 20 people or more, it's up to you. They'd pay lower rates that way.

1097
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:02,840
这间会是你的私人咨询室
This would be your personal consulting room.

1098
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:07,280
就在这间隔壁 乔治 这会是我的房间
And right next door, George, this is gonna be my room.

1099
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:09,880
我会把每件事打理得井井有条
I'm gonna make sure everything gets taken care of.

1100
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:11,520
你就不必操心了
You won't have to worry.

1101
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:14,520
我不明白 那你的其它工作怎么办？
I don't understand. What about your other businesses?

1102
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:16,440
哦 对 当然 那些都是神马浮云
Oh, yeah, of course. They're gone.

1103
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:18,760
等这边一运转起来 忘了它们 明白吗？
Once this thing takes off, forget it, you know?

1104
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:21,800
我送你回家吧 你需要休息 明天对你来说很重要
Let's get you home. You need rest. You got a big day tomorrow.

1105
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:23,840
你已经有三个预约了
You already have three appointments.

1106
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:25,360
- 行吗？  - 好吧
- All right? - Yeah.

1107
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:26,880
走吧
Come on.

1108
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,640
- 你是比利·洛里根？- 没错
- You Billy Lonegan? - Yes.

1109
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:57,920
你兄弟在走之前 让我把这个给你
Before he went, your brother asked me to give this to you.

1110
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:59,600
走？走哪里去了？
Went? Went where?

1111
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:01,240
我也不知道
I have no idea.

1112
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:09,000
亲爱的比利…
Dear Billy...

1113
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:10,760
…我很抱歉
...I'm sorry.

1114
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:14,040
我猜无论我说什么 都无法让你信服…
I guess there's nothing I'll ever be able to say to persuade you...

1115
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:16,720
…我所拥有的不是天赋 而是一个诅咒
...that what I have isn't a gift, but a curse.

1116
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:20,640
我知道你认为我天生注定要去帮助别人
I know you feel what I have comes with a duty to help others

1117
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:24,240
但现在 我最需要帮助的人是我自己
But right now, the person I most need to help is myself.

1118
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,840
所以我决定出去走走
So I've decided to take some time out.

1119
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:29,960
我不清楚未来会发生什么 也不知道何时会回来
I don't know what the future will bring or when I'll be back.

1120
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:32,600
所以别等我 可以这么说
So don't wait up, so to speak.

1121
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:36,640
向珍妮和孩子们问好 你的小兄弟乔治敬上
Love to Jenni and the kids Your baby brother, George.

1122
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:54,120
你应该知道这种精神伤害病例的恢复率
You know the recovery rate in substance abuse cases like this.

1123
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:56,880
- 是的  - 知道 非常低
- Yeah. - Yeah. Very low.

1124
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:01,200
那么 以后最好的方法是什么？你可以再等段时间吗？
So, what's the best way forward? Are you okay for a little bit longer?

1125
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:06,240
是的 但别太久 拜托
Yes. But not too long, please.

1126
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:09,880
我们快没辙了 那已经开始造成伤害了
We're running out of ideas, and it's beginning to take its toll.

1127
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,720
带他去见见我们很早以前帮助过的孩子 瑞奇
Taking him to see our previous child, Ricky.

1128
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:17,560
谁能明白 你能明白吗？一个孩子在和另一个说话
Who knows, you know? One kid talking to another.

1129
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:32,120
- 玛丽·勒菜？- 什么事？

抱歉您说什么？
Excuse me?

您忘了圣达菲的宝瓶出版社？几个月前你给我们寄过你的书
Aquarius books in Santa Fe? A few months ago, you sent us your book.

1133
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,080
我打电话是想告诉你 我们很喜欢你的书
I'm just ringing to say how much we liked it.

1134
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:47,600
抱歉 过了这么久 但我们确实很喜欢它并且决定出版你的书
Sorry it's taken so long, but we loved it, and we'd like to publish it.

1135

- 你住在巴黎吗？- 是的
- You're based in Paris? - Yes

1138
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:58,840
那么 如果我们邀请您去伦敦会不会给您造成不便？
So, if we were to ask going to London wouldn't be inconvenient?

1139
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,960
不会 不 不 不 完全不会
No. No, no, no, not at all.

1140
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:03,640
做一些宣传是很好的机会
That would be a good opportunity to do some publicity.

1141
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:06,800
可能会办个朗诵会 那真是个不可思议的故事
Maybe a reading. It's an incredible story.

1142

But over here, the thing I expect most of you have come to see.

He was about your age when he first came to us, and just as shy.

- 你要逮捕我们吗？ - 是的 但如果你们行为规矩些就不会了
- You gonna arrest us? - Yeah. Not if you behave yourself.

我能四处看看吗？
Can I have a look around?

1186

Yeah. But meet us back here in one hour, yeah?

1187
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:57,440
- 好孩子  - 好吗？
- Good lad. - Okay?

1188
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:04,200
快一年了 他几乎没和我们说过话
It's been nearly a year. He hardly speaks to us.

1189

波利尼逊先生 谦虛地否认自己的优点…
Mr. plornish, with a modest disavowal of his merits...

1195

我们应当以怎么样的一种合理方式…

…来看待死亡及其之后…
...before we will be able to deal with death and what follows...

01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:19,880
…什么事都依着他来做决定…
...and relied on him to make the decision...

1321
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:23,280
…那样你就能有个借口
...how maybe you used that as an excuse.

1322
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:26,080
是那样吗？
Is that true?

1323
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:29,840
好的 他说你不能再那样了

1330
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:00,120
…因为那是他的

...if you're worried about being on your own, don't be.

1345
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:09,280
你不是一个人
You're not.

1346
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:13,600
因为他就是你 你就是他
Because he is you and you are him.
