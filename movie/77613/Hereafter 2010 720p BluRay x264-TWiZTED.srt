1
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,760
Come on, get up.

2
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,600
You need to buy gifts for your kids
before we leave.

3
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,760
I'll pick up something at the airport.

4
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,920
No way.

5
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,160
Airport gifts suck.

6
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,960
Marie, please let me sleep
another half hour.

7
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,520
Fine.

8
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,640
If you won't buy the gifts
for your kids, I will.

9
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,000
Can you ask the front desk
to prepare the bill...

10
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,280
...and have some breakfast sent up?

11
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,360
You know what?
The posters are up, all over paris.

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,120
Apparently, you can't miss them.

13
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,200
How many have you seen?

14
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,400
Really?

15
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,600
Good morning.
Could you prepare the bill for 321?

16
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,040
- Sure.
- And could you send up some breakfast...

17
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,560
...coffee and fruit?

18
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,960
- Okay, I'll call room service.
- Thank you.

19
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,640
They said there would be
120 across paris.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,520
Can you sum up the headlines for me?
I won't have time to go online.

21
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,800
That's good.

22
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,520
Big kisses, bye-bye.

23
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,800
Hello.

24
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,960
Oh, I like this one.
You have more like this?

25
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,000
Yes?

26
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes. Take this one. Yes.

27
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,480
- How much?
- One dollar.

28
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,320
Come on, come on, come on.

29
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,720
Give me your hand! Give me--

30
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,000
Give me your hand!

31
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,040
Can you reach me? Take my hand.

32
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,240
- All right, hold on.
- She's not breathing.

33
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,040
Think she's gone, dude.

34
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,920
- Get back, get back!
- Everybody get off the boat!

35
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Come on.

36
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,720
Roll her over on her side.

37
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,640
- Breathe, breathe.
- Vomit it out. Good, vomit.

38
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,200
Turn her back around.

39
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,800
- Are you okay? You okay?
- Yeah.

40
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,720
- You're okay.
- We got you.

41
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,120
Slow. Slow down.

42
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,800
Marie.

43
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,640
Come in and have a seat.
I'll go talk to my brother, okay?

44
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,240
- No, I'm okay.
- Okay. Sit, sit, sit.

45
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,040
- Hey.
- How could you do this to me?

46
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,240
- What?
- You know I don't do this anymore.

47
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,680
Just one time. This guy's a real important
client of mine. I need this. Come on.

48
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,200
- This is it.
- I know.

49
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,200
- This is it.
- I know.

50
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,880
Okay. Mr...?

51
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,840
Andreou. Christos.

52
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,920
Christos. Okay.

53
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,760
I'm gonna hold your hands just until
I get a connection, and then...

54
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,240
...just for the purposes of the reading,
confine your answers to yes or no.

55
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,080
Give me your hands?

56
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,240
A woman close to you has passed?

57
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,720
Yes.

58
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,200
- In her middle age? Was she in her fifties?
- Yes.

59
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,160
Was this woman your wife?

60
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,760
Yes.

61
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,000
And I'm picking up you were together
for a long time.

62
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,880
Yep.

63
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,040
- But it wasn't always easy.
- No.

64
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,000
- Now I'm picking up she was sick.
- Yep.

65
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,640
She was sick for a long time.
Did she have difficulty moving?

66
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,120
Yes.

67
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,800
Was she bedridden?

68
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,280
Yes. She had multiple sclerosis.

69
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,120
I'm sorry.

70
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,920
She wants to apologize to you
for ruining the marriage.

71
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,160
That's not true.

72
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,240
She feels bad that you had to care for her,
even as a young man...

73
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,560
...and wishes that you'd find someone now,
before it's too late.

74
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,120
Because you're not getting any younger.

75
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,040
Or slimmer.

76
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,800
No.

77
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,800
She's got quite a sense of humor.

78
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,800
- Yeah.
- She's really funny.

79
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,960
Okay, wait. Now she's telling me
to pay attention.

80
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,160
Okay, she has something important
she needs to say.

81
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,480
Okay, she's trying to give me
some kind of a date. June.

82
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,560
In June?

83
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,240
Did that mean anything to you?

84
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,480
- No.
- Is that when you were married? June?

85
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,080
- Is that when she passed?
- No.

86
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,640
I mean, she's being very specific
about June.

87
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,280
Yeah, June.

88
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,520
Hm. Well, maybe I'm wrong.
That happens.

89
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,240
I don't even do this anymore.

90
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,640
Guess I'm rusty.

91
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,880
Thank you. I can't thank you enough.

92
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,680
- Hey. Thanks, baby brother.
- Okay.

93
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,120
I owe you.

94
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,000
That was incredible.

95
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,360
Your brother, I'm telling you,
he's for real.

96
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,520
- I know.
- No, no, no. He's really for real.

97
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,840
I gotta tell you I was skeptical
before I came. All this psychic shit is...

98
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,160
...mumbo-fucking-jumbo
as far as I'm concerned.

99
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,640
He was telling me things
I'd never told anybody.

100
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,120
- He could make money.
- He did. Good money.

101
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,720
Had an office, website, newspaper articles,
even had a book written about him.

102
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,560
Yeah? So, what happened?

103
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,040
Couldn't cope.
Turned his back on the whole thing.

104
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,560
He told me, he said, "A life
that's all about death is no life at all."

105
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,960
He works at a factory and makes 2 grand
a month. He says he's happy.

106
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,280
Who knows?
He wasn't gonna do this again.

107
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,800
I had to persuade him
to make an exception.

108
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,920
Well, I appreciate it, man.
I mean, this was....

109
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,160
I owe you. All right,
I'll talk to you Monday about that thing?

110
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,360
Yeah. Great, Christos, thanks.

111
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,480
Hey. What was with June,
if you don't mind me asking?

112
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,920
June Menendez was my wife's nurse.

113
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
Took care of her for 15 years.

114
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,320
For 10 of those years,
I was in love with her.

115
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,720
And I felt so guilty
I couldn't tell anybody.

116
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,640
Least of all June herself.

117
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,800
Right.

118
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,720
All right, I'll see you.

119
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,080
We might have gone about half a mile...

120
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,120
...and my pocket handkerchief
was quite wet through...

121
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,960
...when looking out, to my amazement,
I saw Peggotty burst from a hedge.

122
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,840
She jumped up into the carriage.
Not a single word did she speak.

123
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,400
She squeezed me until the pressure
on my nose was extremely painful...

124
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,320
...crammed some pieces of cake
into my pockets..

125
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,360
...and a purse,
which she put into my hand.

126
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,200
Then she got down and ran away.

127
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,720
Presently, I noticed one of her buttons
rolling around on the floor.

128
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,280
I picked it up and treasured it
as a keepsake for a long time.

129
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,680
Okay, you two. Yeah.

130
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,800
Oh, lovely. Come on, you guys.
Which one of you two is the oldest?

131
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,160
- Twelve minutes.
- Really? Do you know, I think I could tell.

132
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,680
- And you're Marcus?
- No, he's Marcus.

133
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,680
- Right.
- The quiet one.

134
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,320
Uh-huh. Oh. Aw.

135
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,360
- I was gonna say the handsome one.
- I'm Jason.

136
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,880
Jason, yeah, all right.
The oldest. The chatterbox.

137
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,360
The smartass.

138
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Lovely. Think we're done.

139
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,080
Okey-dokey. What did you guys do,
rob a phone box?

140
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,840
- Thank you.
- Go on.

141
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,120
- Bye.
- Cheers, bye-bye.

142
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,640
- What's the matter?
- I don't understand it. Can I copy yours?

143
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,760
- No.
- please. It has to be in tomorrow.

144
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,840
Tough bananas.

145
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,200
She can see it in the morning.

146
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,920
Good night, Jase.

147
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,800
Good night.

148
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,120
Shit.

149
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,560
Jackie? Are you in there?

150
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,040
Come on, open up.

151
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,160
Come on, wake up.

152
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,880
Open up, please!

153
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,920
Boys, it's no use.
We know you're covering for her.

154
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,320
Wake her up. Make her look better.
Social Services.

155
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,240
Mom! Mom, wake up!

156
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,400
Jackie, you in there?

157
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,560
She's not here. She's gone to the shops.

158
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,200
Mom, come on!

159
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,560
We're gonna wait.

160
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,080
Boys, it's no use.
We know you're covering for her.

161
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,720
Come on, Mom. Get up, please!

162
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,520
Come on. You're wasting our time.

163
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,560
If she's not here in five minutes...

164
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,560
...we'll call the police Child protective Unit.

165
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,560
Come on. Open up.

166
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,960
He means that! Five minutes!

167
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,560
Thanks. I've got it.

168
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,320
Jason, open the door.

169
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,120
You can come in
and wait for her if you want.

170
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,120
Have a seat.

171
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,600
Thanks.

172
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,120
Hope she won't be much longer.

173
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,360
I'm home!

174
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,200
Hello. I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

175
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,800
Hi.

176
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,520
I completely forgot you were
gonna be here.

177
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,720
Jason, go put the kettle on.

178
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,920
Marcus, go and get a plate.
Let's get these biscuits out.

179
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,240
- Have you been here long?
- A while.

180
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,840
Sorry.

181
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,640
It's all right, Jackie.
Why don't you sit down?

182
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,280
You know what I'm thinking?

183
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:28,320
I'm thinking that is the best present
in the whole wide world.

184
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,760
Absolutely love it. Thank you.

185
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,360
Thank you.

186
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,760
My boys.

187
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,440
- Marcus, will you do something?
- Yeah.

188
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,680
- Get the red box in the cupboard.
- Yes, Mom.

189
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,400
Thank you.

190
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,640
Now, I want you to go down
to the chemist.

191
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,320
Give this to the nice man.
Then he'll know what to do, okay?

192
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,640
- Yes, Mom.
- Thank you, baby.

193
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,600
- I'll do it.
- Why?

194
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,160
Marcus hasn't done his homework yet.

195
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,480
- Go on, then.
- Call me on this and I'll talk you through it.

196
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,640
Yeah, but not long, okay?
I haven't got any credit.

197
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,400
Take care, Jason, okay?

198
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,600
- I will.
- I'll see you later.

199
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,560
And why haven't you done
your homework?

200
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,520
Come here, you.

201
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,600
Look at your silly little face. An angel.

202
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,520
Okay. It's okay. Forget about your
homework. You can copy mine.

203
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,520
I want you to look up
naltrexone and hydrochloride.

204
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,720
Okay. Hang on a minute.

205
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,880
Found it. I think this is it.

206
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,480
"Naltrexone blocks the effects
of heroin and of opiates.

207
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,200
Detoxification can last between
a week and a month."

208
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,160
Does that mean she's stopping?

209
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,800
Yeah, I think that's exactly
what it means.

210
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,440
This is great. She's never done this before
up till now. It's just been promises.

211
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,440
- Yeah, I knew it was just a matter of time.
- There you are.

212
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,960
Thank you.

213
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,400
Just think. It'd be like living
in a normal family for once.

214
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,360
That kid's got a mobile.

215
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,680
Hey, little one.

216
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,160
Hey, come here, lad.

217
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,400
Leave me alone!

218
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,480
Give me your phone, mate.

219
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,240
Give me that back!

220
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,200
Jase?

221
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,440
What do you got pills for?
You're a little freak.

222
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,720
Get your phone, brother.
Get your phone.

223
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,520
- Grab him!
- Wait a minute, little prick!

224
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,280
- Come here!
- Little prick!

225
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,200
Come on, little prick!

226
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,560
Come on, you little dickhead,
where you going?

227
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,040
Jase?

228
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,600
Marcus!

229
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,200
Jason?

230
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,640
Jason?

231
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,240
please, Jason.

232
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Jason, come on. I need you.

233
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,080
please.

234
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,960
- Come on.
- Come on.

235
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,480
Jason!

236
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,280
Jason, come on. please, Jase.

237
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,120
Jase.

238
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,680
I feel bad.
I should've stayed on to cover the story.

239
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,040
After what happened to you?

240
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,880
They've sent a crew
from the Hong Kong office.

241
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,040
I've never done that...

242
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,720
...run away from such a story.

243
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,760
- You okay?
- Yeah.

244
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,680
- Should I come up?
- No, I'll be fine.

245
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,480
I almost forgot...

246
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,040
...the gifts for your kids.

247
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,360
I love you.

248
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,400
The estimated
figures are at several billion dollars

249
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,480
But of course, we're going to talk
about the survivors..

250
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,120
...because we hope there are survivors

251
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,120
The number of victims is estimated
at several hundred thousand.

252
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,560
It is a horrific scene here,
as this tsunami...

253
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,560
...has devastated the population.

254
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,240
Good evening, everyone.

255
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,960
Marie, can you hear me?

256
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,920
Mm-hm.

257
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,760
Everybody, break a leg.
Ready and on the air in...

258
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,520
...five, four...

259
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,280
...three, two...

260
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,160
...and cue, Miss Lelay.

261
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,880
Good evening,
and welcome to a new edition...

262
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,640
...of Window on Events.

263
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,600
Tonight, our guest is
Guillaume Belcher...

264
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:28,080
...CEO of famous
clothing manufacturer Soucil.

265
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,000
We're going to present to you
a shocking investigation...

266
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,240
...on child labor in their factories
in Southeast Asia.

267
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,880
Cyril Guignard reporting.

268
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,560
Here in the West, it's
easy to criticize Third World labor practices

269
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,520
But the truth is..

270
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,720
...these factories..

271
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,480
...play a vital role in
industrial development...

272
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,320
...and evolution of poorer countries.

273
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,360
And let's be clear about this,
the wages we are paying...

274
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,040
...are substantially higher
than local wages.

275
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,920
Marie, go at him!

276
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,320
Marie, do you hear me?

277
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,800
pull this guy apart!

278
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,800
You hear me, get him!

279
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:35,000
But will this kind of justification satisfy
French customers...

280
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,040
...Mr. Belcher?

281
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,480
If they were aware of the conditions
under which the clothes are produced...

282
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,080
...do you think you would
still be profitable?

283
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,920
Go there and you'll see how much
these people need us.

284
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,160
Thank you for watching.

285
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,560
That's all for now, see you next week.

286
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,600
I'm sorry, that was unforgivable.

287
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,000
We'll fix it in the edit. No one will notice.

288
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,800
And it was my fault.

289
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,960
A defensive CEO was a tough start
for the new season.

290
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,080
Do you want to get something to eat?

291
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,720
I'll see you tomorrow.

292
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,680
I think something happened
to me out there.

293
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,840
You had a close call.

294
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,120
No, something really happened to me.

295
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,680
When I went underwater...

296
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,760
...I had visions.

297
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,000
I don't know.

298
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,360
You had a concussion.
You hit your head.

299
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,720
Hm?

300
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,640
You're right.

301
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,600
Two right-wing newspapers
claim Sikhs were out in the streets...

302
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,400
...burning cars, looting shops.

303
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:23,120
Others say the unrest was triggered by
elements within the nationalist parties...

304
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,560
...to cast negative suspicion
on racial minorities.

305
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,160
What do you think about
the story on the Sikhs?

306
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,600
What?

307
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,440
The story on the Sikhs,
what do you think?

308
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,240
It's very good.

309
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,360
Listen, I've got to work late
and finish some things.

310
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,800
See you tomorrow.

311
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,800
Can I say something...

312
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,440
...you might find difficult to hear?

313
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,760
I think you came back to work too soon.

314
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,360
physically, you're fine.
But since the accident....

315
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,320
Take some time off
to get over what happened.

316
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,280
Just a couple of weeks.

317
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,720
To "get over"?

318
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,960
You've always said you wanted to write.

319
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,080
Your book idea, Michel would jump on it
and pay good money.

320
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,160
But that would take time.

321
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,840
This will all be here waiting for you.

322
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,360
What matters is that you feel better.

323
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,280
We need you too much.

324
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,640
I'll think about it.

325
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,320
Hey.

326
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,240
You see that meeting going on?
On the first floor?

327
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,760
- The head office guys and the union?
- No, no, I didn't.

328
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,120
Yeah, well, they were in there
all afternoon.

329
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,640
Kind of makes you think
the rumors are true, huh?

330
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,320
What rumor?

331
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:26,040
That they're gonna let 30 percent of
the workforce go. You heard that, right?

332
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,960
Yeah, right. Right.

333
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,280
What's the matter with you today?

334
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,640
No, I just didn't get
a lot of sleep last night.

335
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,480
Well, see you tomorrow, all right?

336
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,960
- Yeah, yeah. I'll see you.
- Yeah.

337
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,040
Down the end of the hall, on your left.
Hi there.

338
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,280
Welcome, all of you,
to this 10-week course in Italian cuisine.

339
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,040
My name is Carlo.
Some of you know me already.

340
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,960
You've done some of my other courses.

341
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,760
Those of you that don't, buonasera,
and you can call me "Chef."

342
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,520
We'll be working in pairs
throughout the course...

343
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,200
...so one of the first things I want to do
today is to pair you all up.

344
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,120
All right? Don't be shy. Grab a partner.

345
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,360
I see some of you have
come in twos already.

346
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,960
Others have worked together before.

347
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,240
Okay. Now who's left?

348
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,520
Excuse me. God. I'm sorry.

349
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,440
I'm so sorry I'm late.

350
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,480
The roads were closed
for some reason...

351
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:58,080
...plus this jerk in registration took an age
processing my application.

352
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,480
Am I too late?

353
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,720
No. No, no. Not at all.
What is your name?

354
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,160
- Melanie.
- We were just pairing people off.

355
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,040
Why don't we put you with....

356
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,040
- What is your name?
- George.

357
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,960
Melanie with George.
And, Alice, you're with....

358
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,800
Tony.

359
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,520
How you doing, Tony?

360
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,360
- Sorry.
- All right.

361
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,400
Now, in exercise class,
you warm up with stretches.

362
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,280
We're gonna warm up
with a glass of Barbaresco...

363
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,360
...a beautiful wine from the piedmont
region in northwestern Italy...

364
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,160
- ...made from the Nebbiolo grape.
- Hi. George.

365
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,160
Take a sip.

366
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,240
Mm. Mm.

367
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,600
And some music.

368
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:53,200
Because cooking is all the senses, right?
The nose, the eyes, the palate and the ears.

369
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,600
And tonight, we're gonna start
at the beginning.

370
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,760
The cornerstone of so much
of Italian cooking...

371
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,800
...the classic tomato sauce
from Toscana.

372
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,880
And in preparation, we're gonna need
chopped tomatoes, so let's get chopping.

373
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,800
Take your time. Doing all right?
Look at these beautiful tomatoes, huh?

374
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,880
Ah, the music. Is this beautiful?

375
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,000
God, some of them are really good.

376
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,680
Is this your first time?

377
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,280
- Yeah.
- Yeah, mine too.

378
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,720
I read in the brochure that the course
builds to a competition.

379
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,280
I saw that. To be judged
by a local restaurant critic.

380
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,320
Yeah. I don't think we should
get our hopes up. Heh, heh.

381
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,800
Well, we still have 10 weeks.

382
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,200
- Well, that's true.
- And we haven't cut our fingers off yet.

383
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,640
That's a good attitude.

384
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,280
Which one of us is using the wrong knife?
Am I using the wrong knife?

385
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,680
Yeah. You're using that.

386
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,080
The woman next to me
brought her own knife.

387
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,560
- Really?
- Very intimidating.

388
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,120
So I'll see you next week.

389
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,600
Great. Yeah. See you next week.

390
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,360
- George Lonegan?
- Yeah.

391
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,560
I hate to bother you.

392
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,200
I'm Mr. Andreou's neighbor.

393
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,040
The Greek guy, mid-fifties,
who lost his wife.

394
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,400
I believe you recently did
a reading for him.

395
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,200
- I'm just gonna stop you.
- Candace.

396
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,640
Okay, Candace,
I don't do readings anymore.

397
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,200
You did one last week for Mr. Andreou.

398
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,080
He's an associate of my brother's.
It was a one-time thing.

399
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,760
please, I give you my word.
I won't tell anyone.

400
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,600
- I'm sorry.
- Listen, listen, listen. I brought money.

401
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,840
- I don't want your money.
- Everything I have.

402
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,840
I lost my child.

403
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,240
My only child. Just a baby.

404
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,960
I just wanna talk to her.

405
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,880
please, I wanna talk to my baby.

406
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,640
I can't help you. I don't do that anymore!

407
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,200
- please!
- Mr. Lonegan! I got money!

408
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,760
Mr. Lonegan. please.

409
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,160
I wanna talk to my baby.

410
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,480
Go, girls! There you go! Kick it!

411
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,000
So another person came to see me
for a reading.

412
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,000
Thanks to your friend Mr. Andreou.

413
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,920
- What?
- Yeah.

414
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,800
Told that Greek jerk to keep
his big mouth shut.

415
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,600
Go, girls! Kick it back!
You gotta kick it back!

416
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,160
Well, obviously he didn't.

417
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,680
I'll talk with him, make sure nothing
like that ever happens again.

418
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,320
Okay.

419
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,480
And?

420
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,960
- And what?
- Did you do it?

421
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,080
- What?
- The reading.

422
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,160
- Did you do the reading?
- You still don't get it, do you?

423
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,160
You think just because I can
make money doing this...

424
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,080
...just because I can that I should do it.

425
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,960
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

426
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,680
I also think you have a duty to do it
because you have a gift.

427
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,320
It's not a gift, Billy. It's a curse.

428
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,880
You have no idea. It ruins any chance
I have at a normal life.

429
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,080
Feel like a freak.

430
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,920
Freak?

431
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,080
Freak or not, Georgie, it's who you are.

432
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,320
It's what you are, you know.
You can't run from that forever.

433
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,080
To divert
his thoughts from this melancholy subject...

434
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,800
...I informed Mr. Micawher that I
relied on him for a bowl of punch...

435
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,040
...and led him to the lemons

436
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,720
His recent despondency,
not to say despair, was gone in a moment.

437
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,760
I never saw a man
so thoroughly enjoy himself...

438
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:36,400
...amid the fragrance of lemon peel
and sugar, and the smell of burning rum...

439
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,360
...as he stirred and mixed and tasted...

440
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,200
...and looked as if he were making,
instead of punch...

441
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,680
...a fortune for his family
to last for all posterity.

442
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,040
Death is not final.
It is merely the beginning.

443
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,200
Gateway to an afterlife that reflects
our conduct here on earth.

444
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:11,200
God, in his infinite generosity,
has created heaven...

445
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,920
...which is where Jason is now...

446
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:17,680
...surrounded by all the angels and saints,
looking down at us.

447
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:24,160
And so we commit Jason's body to dust,
his soul already in God's care.

448
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,560
Jason's ashes will be available
at the back...

449
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,840
...but if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like you to leave through the front door.

450
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,440
Morning.

451
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,640
please come in.

452
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,760
Thank you.

453
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,720
Morning.

454
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,200
Good night, Jase.

455
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,360
It won't be for long.
It's a short-term placement.

456
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,160
Just until your mum feels better.

457
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:13,480
The couple we have in mind have a lot of
experience and live close to where you live.

458
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,360
Of course you'll stay at the same school.

459
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,480
I don't wanna go with anyone else.

460
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,600
I wanna stay with you.

461
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,800
Where are you going?

462
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,640
Just give us a minute, will you?

463
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,160
Look, I need a little time
to sort myself out.

464
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,440
But I'm not running away, I promise.

465
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,040
I could stay with you now,
and I want that so much.

466
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:12,240
But chances are I wouldn't make it,
because I'm not strong enough.

467
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,120
I don't expect you to understand.

468
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,400
And I know for me to leave you now...

469
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,800
...it must feel like the worst thing
in the world.

470
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,080
But I promise you I'm not gonna
let you down, okay?

471
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,840
I promise you.

472
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,160
I'm so sorry.

473
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,320
I love you. Come here.

474
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,200
Come here.

475
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,560
Be a good boy.

476
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,040
Come on.

477
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,280
Summing up France's postwar
history, only two statesmen counted:

478
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,080
De Gaulle and him.

479
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:20,120
On de Gaulle, everything's been written.
On Mitterrand, I want to finish the job.

480
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,000
There are fascinating elements.

481
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,400
The abolition of the death penalty,
the European Union.

482
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,920
Coming from a right-wing family,
he seduced the left.

483
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,080
And what's more,
converted it to liberalism.

484
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,560
Amazing! It was a revolution, right?

485
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,720
plus the darker sides of his character
that have never been explored.

486
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,800
He's been dead for 10 years.
The timing is right, we can dig deeper.

487
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,400
I want to dig into his past.

488
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,560
Vichy, the Elf scandal....
What part did he play?

489
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,640
The Taiwan frigates,
the papon scandal...

490
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,240
...Mazarine, Marguerite Duras.

491
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,560
These stories were never really addressed.
They've all been buried.

492
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,120
I'm going to tell who knew,
who didn't talk.

493
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,080
Isn't that going to bring us
too much controversy?

494
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,880
I don't think so.

495
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,560
What I want is a book
that can be read by all.

496
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,520
Mitterrand was not just a politician.

497
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,080
Mitterrand was an icon.

498
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,160
He's "Tonton," our uncle!

499
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,560
Maybe that's what we should use
as the title!

500
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,200
- Tonton.
- Heh, heh, heh.

501
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,880
I'm not sure we can keep that title.

502
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,040
Of course not. It was a joke.

503
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,760
I'll welcome your suggestions
for the title.

504
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,800
How about Chipping Away at the Myth
or The Vacillating Statue?

505
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,440
I look forward to your suggestions.

506
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,640
We'll make a list.

507
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,600
Congratulations.

508
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,000
The timing couldn't be better.

509
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,200
politically, there's nothing going on
now anyway.

510
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:57,640
You'll write the book you've always
wanted to. You'll get some rest.

511
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,760
Come this summer,
you'll be back on the air...

512
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,480
...with a bestseller under your belt,
and a big renegotiated contract.

513
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,320
Stronger than ever.

514
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,640
Exactly.

515
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,240
Adapting and turning misfortune
to your advantage.

516
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,360
That's what I've always loved about you,
never a victim.

517
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,880
That's right.

518
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:22,120
Never a victim, never vulnerable,
never complains.

519
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,680
Excuse me. Your table is ready.

520
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,640
Great. I'm starving.

521
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,840
Can I ask you something?

522
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,880
What do you think happens
when we die?

523
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,520
That's a strange question!

524
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,040
Tell me.

525
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,000
When you die, you die.
The lights go out, that's it.

526
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,560
Why?

527
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,600
That's it? Just blackout?

528
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,880
Totally black, the plug's pulled out.

529
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,400
The eternal void.

530
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:02,200
Don't you think it's possible
that there is something?

531
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,720
Like what?

532
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,320
I don't know, something....

533
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,240
A hereafter.

534
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,240
No, I don't.

535
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,120
If that were the case, wouldn't someone
have discovered it by now?

536
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,320
And there would be proof.

537
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,320
I guess.

538
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,640
Do you have a lot of questions like that?

539
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,920
More champagne?

540
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,160
Huh?

541
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:32,080
Okay, does everyone have
their blindfolds on?

542
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Okay.

543
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:38,200
Now, if you wanna be a good cook,
first we need to work on your palate.

544
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,920
To stimulate your imaginations,
your senses.

545
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:46,320
No good being an expert chopper,
dicer, roaster, toaster...

546
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,280
...if you can't give names and colors,
and even shapes, to flavors.

547
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,160
Okay. Now, spoon number one.

548
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:00,600
Now, look, this isn't easy. So don't worry
if you don't immediately identify it.

549
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,360
Let's start by trying to describe it.

550
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,880
What is the texture?

551
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,120
Okay, you ready?

552
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,920
- What is the consistency?
- Open.

553
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,480
Very good.

554
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,200
What?

555
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,840
I have no freaking idea what this is.

556
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,440
"No freaking idea." Okay.

557
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,400
But, um....

558
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,840
It's not a fruit.

559
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,120
It's kind of nutty.

560
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:42,760
- But it's kind of sweet too. I think.
- Okay.

561
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,000
"A little nutty."

562
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,960
"Kind of sweet."

563
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,000
- Did she get it?
- Yeah.

564
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,440
So how are we gonna do this?

565
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,680
What?

566
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:59,280
Well, we could make up a whole
load of crap, or we could...

567
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,920
...cut to the chase and be honest
with one another.

568
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,440
About?

569
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:07,160
About why we're both doing
night-school classes?

570
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,440
- All right.
- Open.

571
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,800
Everybody okay? How we doing?

572
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,520
Mm.

573
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,240
There's, um....

574
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,240
There's something oaky about that.

575
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,400
"Oaky." Okay.

576
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:29,080
- Yeah. Nutmeggy? I think.
- Okay.

577
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,680
You're not gonna tell me it's
because you wanna make...

578
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,480
...the perfect spaghetti vongole, right?

579
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,800
No, not entirely.

580
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,640
Okay. I'll jump in.

581
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:48,720
I'm doing this because
I'm new to San Francisco.

582
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,680
Because I'm looking
to make new friends.

583
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:58,560
And who knows? If I'm lucky,
maybe even meet the man of my dreams.

584
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,760
- Here, open.
- Okay.

585
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,160
So why'd you move to San Francisco?

586
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,960
Uh....

587
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,560
Because I got dumped by someone
in pittsburgh.

588
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,280
Sorry.

589
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:31,360
Not quite at the aisle, but pretty close.

590
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:36,760
Down payment on the wedding dress,
honeymoon booked. That kind of thing.

591
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,840
I mean, it's okay. You know, I'm....

592
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,520
I'm over it, just about.

593
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,320
Not at all, actually.

594
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,080
What'd that taste like?

595
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,560
Oh. Um....

596
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,320
I don't know.

597
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:05,280
I mean, I really-- I don't....

598
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,760
- Wanna try again?
- Yeah, okay.

599
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,280
Okay.

600
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,760
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

601
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,480
Okay.

602
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,960
- Is that a bean?
- Yeah.

603
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,880
- Really?
- Yeah.

604
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,480
You know what color it is?

605
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,240
It's like....

606
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,120
Tastes like a black bean.

607
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,240
- Am I right?
- Yes.

608
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,080
How we doing? Don't be shy.

609
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,560
- Here we go.
- Oh, well...

610
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:05,640
...like you, I recently made
a big change to my life...

611
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:13,640
...and I just wanted to reevaluate things
and change my priorities.

612
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,240
What was--? What was the change?

613
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,640
Divorce or...?

614
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,800
Oh, no, no, nothing like that. No.

615
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:26,640
A job that I needed to put behind me.

616
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
It was making
any kind of life impossible.

617
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,200
Definitely a nut.

618
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,320
You're not gonna tell me,
you know, what the job was?

619
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,960
Would you mind if I didn't?

620
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,480
I mean, don't worry,
I wasn't like a criminal or anything.

621
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,760
- Okay. So open up.
- Okay.

622
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,040
No hitting on Alice.

623
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,680
- peppers.
- Yeah.

624
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,880
- Wasn't that great?
- Yeah, fun.

625
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,360
God, it's made me so hungry.

626
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,600
Yeah, me too.

627
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,000
Do you wanna get something to eat?

628
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:13,360
Yeah. There's actually a place nearby
that everyone's talking about.

629
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:18,000
place nearby, are you kidding me?
We're practically experts ourselves.

630
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,360
- I can drive.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah, great, okay.

631
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,520
So you been in San Francisco long?

632
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,240
Born and bred, yeah.

633
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,040
Oh, nice.

634
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,440
You can just leave all that. I'll get it.
You just get comfortable.

635
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:56,560
No, I'm your partner. Remember?
I have to....

636
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,400
- We have to do this together.
- Okay.

637
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,480
Oh, my gosh. Are these...?

638
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:09,040
- This is you? As a kid?
- Yeah, that's me and my brother, Billy.

639
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,240
Let me tell you, you got the looks.

640
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,800
Well, he got everything else.

641
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,480
Are these his kids?

642
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,480
Yeah. My nieces.

643
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,280
Hm.

644
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,680
Who's this?

645
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,560
Is this some kind of ancestor?

646
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,080
No, that's Charles Dickens.

647
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,880
- Oh.
- I'm a fan. I'm a huge fan.

648
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:35,480
You know, people go on and on
about Shakespeare and it's--

649
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:38,080
I mean, he's great, of course,
but Dickens....

650
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,040
No, no, I'll get that. I got it.

651
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:45,040
There's a-- There's a little trick.

652
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,000
Hey. It's Billy.

653
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,280
Just to say I finally
caught up with our Greek friend.

654
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,640
Told him to keep his mouth shut. Okay?

655
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,240
Just relax. There shouldn't be
any more freaks..

656
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,960
...knocking on your door asking
for readings, you know?

657
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,480
I gotta say though, this guy...

658
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,520
...he made a big point of saying
how brilliant you were...

659
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,840
...and with so many fakers out there,
someone who had a genuine gift.

660
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,040
I don't know--

661
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,480
Sorry about that.

662
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,880
Uh....

663
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,880
- What gift?
- Oh, nothing. Don't worry about it.

664
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,200
No, I mean, I'm interested.

665
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:28,040
Well, the job I had before,
it was as a psychic.

666
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,920
I know, but....

667
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,560
- What?
- But it's true.

668
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,480
I had an illness as a child...

669
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,840
...and I had an infection,
which turned into a fever...

670
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,520
...which turned into inflammation
of my brain and spinal cord.

671
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,640
It's called encephalomyelitis.

672
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:53,360
And they had to operate,
in the back, here.

673
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:59,280
It was a complicated procedure. It was
eight hours. And they nearly lost me.

674
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,280
Actually, technically, they did lose me...

675
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,440
...and bring me back
on a number of occasions.

676
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,560
Anyway, they cured the illness...

677
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:14,560
...but they must've messed up something
else while they were back there, because...

678
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,360
...not long after,
I started to have these migraines.

679
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:20,120
And then nightmares.

680
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:25,360
And then these connections.

681
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:31,840
And one day I'm sitting with a friend,
and I had a vision of a woman...

682
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,680
...a crystal-clear vision.

683
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,320
And I described her to him.

684
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,680
And turned out it was an exact description
of his mother, someone I'd never met...

685
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:46,080
...who'd died the previous week.

686
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,880
And you're not laughing yet.

687
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,640
No, I'm not.

688
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:56,360
Well, anyway, I assumed
it was some kind of a coincidence.

689
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:01,880
But as time went on, I began having more
and more of these things, connections.

690
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:06,240
So the doctors ran a bunch of tests.

691
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:10,120
They told my parents that I'd developed
something called passive schizophrenia.

692
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:14,440
They gave me a bunch of pills and,
you know, the pills stopped the visions...

693
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,600
...but they pretty much
stopped everything else also...

694
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,440
...so I had this choice.

695
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:23,600
I was either gonna live my life
with these hallucinations...

696
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,160
...with apparently no way
of switching it off.

697
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:30,120
Or I could have no life at all.

698
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,120
Oh, my God.

699
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,480
See, there, now I've been
neglecting my duties.

700
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:41,520
Could I ask you a question?

701
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,400
You know, these are probably
ready to go in.

702
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,120
George?

703
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,440
Would it be okay if I told you
the answer was no?

704
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,800
You don't even know
what I was gonna ask.

705
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,440
Yes, I do. You're gonna ask me
if I can do a reading for you.

706
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,480
Look, Melanie, I barely know you...

707
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,240
...but I like you a lot.

708
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,160
Really, a lot.

709
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,160
Is there any way we could pretend
that maybe we go back in time...

710
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:18,680
...and just forget about the phone ringing,
and my brother's message...

711
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,320
- ...and we never had this conversation?
- Why?

712
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,480
If we open the door
and go down that road...

713
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,440
...any chance that we had of having
something normal will just be gone.

714
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,440
It just will.

715
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:35,360
Believe me. I have enough
experience of that now.

716
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,520
I mean, sometimes, I mean....

717
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:43,360
You know, knowing everything
about someone, it's--

718
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:46,320
You know, it seems nice, but, really...

719
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,960
...maybe it's actually better
to hold stuff back.

720
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,080
I hear you.

721
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:56,520
But you can understand. I'm curious.

722
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:00,160
No, of course. I mean, yeah. Yeah.

723
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,080
please?

724
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:20,080
Okay.

725
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,200
Come on.

726
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,760
Here, take a seat.

727
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,680
Okay.

728
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:38,080
I'm gonna take your hands for a second,
to get a connection...

729
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:41,480
...and then I'll let go, and I'll just
ask you a couple questions.

730
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:42,720
All right.

731
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,240
Okay. Give me your hands.

732
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,600
Okay.

733
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,400
Okay.

734
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,800
There's a woman. And she's tall.

735
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,400
Thin. She has brown hair.

736
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,240
Do you know who I'm talking about?

737
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,920
Is this woman your mother?

738
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,520
Yes.

739
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:21,280
And I'm feeling a pain in my chest.

740
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:29,960
Yeah. That's how she died.
Of a heart attack.

741
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,480
I'm sorry.

742
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,440
Okay. You ready to eat?

743
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:42,440
There's not something else?

744
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:46,000
- No, there's nothing--
- No, no, no, I can tell.

745
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:49,000
please, there is, I can tell.

746
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:54,120
I mean, what's the matter?
You don't think I could handle it?

747
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,880
All right, um....

748
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,360
When you touched me before,
there was a....

749
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,760
There was a man.

750
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,480
Dark hair.

751
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,000
My father.

752
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,880
He passed away not too long ago?

753
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,480
- Last year.
- And....

754
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,160
All he kept saying,
all I kept hearing was--

755
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,440
Was what?

756
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,560
How sorry he was.

757
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,480
What for?

758
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:41,320
For what he did to you all that time ago.

759
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:50,840
And he hoped
that you could one day forgive him.

760
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,920
I'm sorry.

761
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:02,880
I'm sorry.

762
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,000
I'm sorry...

763
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,520
...for pressing you like that.

764
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:20,520
Maybe we shouldn't have gone there.

765
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
I don't know what to say.

766
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,320
Except if I....

767
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:36,880
If I go now...

768
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:41,520
...if we draw a line under this...

769
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,400
...pretend it never happened...

770
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,240
...we'll be okay.

771
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,840
I'm sure.

772
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,080
Good.

773
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,520
Good.

774
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:15,160
We still have the competition
to win. Right?

775
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,960
Right.

776
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,280
I should've listened to you.

777
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,800
You know, too much knowledge
and all that.

778
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,080
I'll see you next week.

779
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,800
Yeah, you betcha.

780
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:50,920
MAN The old, unhappy
feeling that had once pervaded my life...

781
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:57,320
...came back like an unwelcome visitor,
and deeper than ever.

782
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:01,680
It addressed me like a strain
of sorrowful music...

783
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:06,240
...a hopeless consciousness
of all that I had lost...

784
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,160
...all that I had ever loved.

785
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:14,880
And all that remained
was a ruined blank and waste...

786
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:20,520
...lying around me,
unbroken to the dark horizon.

787
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,480
All right, son, out you get.

788
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:29,400
All right. Lovely, thanks.

789
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:34,040
- Hello.
- Hi, Marcus!

790
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:36,760
Hi. I'm Angela. This is Dennis.

791
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,480
All right, mate?

792
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,400
I call him Dennis the Menace.

793
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:45,480
Now, I'll show you the kitchen.

794
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,240
Just keep walking through there.

795
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,760
So this is where we eat
our breakfast in the morning.

796
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,360
What do you like to eat in the mornings?

797
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:58,160
We're porridge eaters in this house.
Do you like porridge?

798
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,960
Or cornflakes?

799
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,800
This is your room.

800
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,720
Our last boy, Ricky, moved out
about a month ago.

801
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,880
Just turned 18.
Got his first job, security guard.

802
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,560
Go on, mate. It's all yours now.

803
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,160
Do you
think it's possible to get another bed?

804
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,960
Two secs, Marcus.

805
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:40,080
We're gonna need another bed.

806
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,920
Upstairs? Should I take yours?

807
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,320
- You all right?
- Yeah.

808
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:43,760
Good night, Jase.

809
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:50,400
Who agrees? A and D. "Rowan is an
old Roman word for a mountain ash."

810
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,320
"A mountain ash lives over 100 years."

811
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:55,400
And does anybody else
think it's anything else?

812
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:58,520
Marcus, could you take
the hat off, please?

813
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:00,920
Thank you.

814
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:04,320
So now let's move on to number six.

815
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,760
On the next page.

816
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:11,000
So you're gonna need to look
at the extract, "Wings of Courage."

817
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,840
- Thank you very much for coming in.
- You're welcome.

818
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,640
And....

819
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,600
We'll be in touch
when we've made the appointment.

820
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,080
Yeah. Okay, great.

821
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:26,760
Let's get it sorted as soon as possible.

822
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:27,960
Thanks.

823
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:30,240
All right, Marcus? See you soon, mate.

824
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,280
Be a good little man.

825
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:46,080
It's lunchtime, Marcus. You gonna go?

826
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:16,760
The angel of death comes to you...

827
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:21,360
...and will find you,
no matter where you are hiding.

828
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:25,920
Even if you are hiding in,
like a rich man in a castle...

829
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:30,400
...the angel of God will find you.

830
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,760
Hello.

831
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,720
A number of us are probably
too frightened to ask:

832
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,520
"What happens to us when we die?"

833
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:51,800
But the good news is, if you believe
in Christ, you have nothing to fear.

834
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,760
Excuse me. I don't understand.

835
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:12,880
Ah. What wouldn't we give to know
exactly where she's gone?

836
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:16,440
But from what you wrote in your letter,
perhaps you know already.

837
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,400
- Claudia Rousseau.
- Marie Lelay.

838
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:21,640
- I'm so happy to meet you.
- You too.

839
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:25,600
You know, I really need to talk
about the vision I had.

840
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:27,640
- Sure, go ahead.
- Yeah.

841
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:31,440
It was a very peaceful sensation.

842
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:36,520
Everything was quiet.
Darkness everywhere.

843
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:39,720
And a light was catching my eyes.

844
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,440
And I was hearing the sound
of a gentle wind.

845
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,640
Mm-hm.

846
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,920
A feeling of weightlessness?

847
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:48,440
Yes.

848
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,160
A 360 perspective?

849
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:54,040
No sense of linear time or motion?

850
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,440
Yes.

851
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,360
But all-knowing, all-sensing?

852
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:58,720
Exactly.

853
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:01,080
- Would you care for some tea?
- Thank you.

854
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:05,280
You know, as a scientist and atheist...

855
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:08,240
...my mind was closed to such things.

856
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:12,040
Oh, absolutely.
Afterlife, near-death experiences.

857
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:15,160
Like everyone else,
I thought people saw bright lights...

858
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,200
...Eden-like gardens and so forth...

859
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:21,040
...because they were
culturally conditioned to do so.

860
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:25,560
But after 25 years in a hospice...

861
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:28,920
...working with people,
many of whom were pronounced dead...

862
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:32,280
...but then miraculously survived...

863
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:36,920
...the account of what they actually
experienced were so strikingly similar...

864
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,480
...it couldn't just be coincidence.

865
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:44,720
And add to that the fact that when
they had these experiences...

866
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,160
...they were almost all unconscious...

867
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:52,880
...a state in which my enemies agree
the brain cannot create fresh images.

868
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:58,080
So you think I really did
experience something?

869
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,560
Oh, yes.

870
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,880
I think you experienced death.

871
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,560
It's all here.

872
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:12,920
I'm afraid if your journey is anything
like mine, it won't be an easy one.

873
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,960
It's a lonely field to plow.

874
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:19,360
people get quite irrational around
this subject. Quite hostile, even.

875
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:22,600
But the evidence is irrefutable.

876
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,480
I tried.

877
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:31,920
You know, perhaps someone like you...

878
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:36,840
...in your position, and with your influence,
can change that.

879
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,880
I hope you can.

880
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,000
Thank you.

881
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,280
Good luck.

882
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,120
I'll send it back when I'm done.

883
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:21,720
Good evening.

884
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:25,560
Following a joint statement by Vivendi
and electricity giant VFM..

885
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:28,280
...announcing higher than expected
quarterly profits..

886
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:33,800
...we wonder if evoking France's economic
downturn might be premature?

887
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,360
Like to see you upstairs.

888
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,000
George, have a seat.

889
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:14,400
You're probably aware there's been a lot
of talk about cutbacks.

890
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,600
Yeah, I heard.

891
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:19,680
Yeah. Anyway, seems the suits
got together with the unions...

892
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:24,000
...and came up with packages for anyone
willing to consider voluntary redundancy.

893
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,080
Voluntary redundancy?

894
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,520
Look, if you ask me,
the deal is pretty good.

895
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:32,840
You get six months' pay in your pocket
with health insurance for two years.

896
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,360
So, what does this have to do with me?

897
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,240
It's a freaking scandal.
You worked there three years?

898
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,520
You never missed a day,
never called in sick.

899
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,480
- He said it was nothing personal.
- That's B.S.

900
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,320
He's trying to protect the guys
who have wives and kids.

901
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:55,120
- You should hire a lawyer.
- I can't afford a lawyer.

902
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:58,280
If you need help getting another job,
I'll help you with that.

903
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:02,480
I'll make calls. I'll make it happen. But you
know what I think you should do, right?

904
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,360
Yes, I do.

905
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,600
You know, the website's still up.
Waiting.

906
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,360
It'd be different this time, George.

907
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:15,880
We could control it.
That's how it would be different.

908
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,760
We'd only do two clients a day,
three, tops. Keep it small.

909
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:21,800
Don't give out your phone number.
We won't talk to the media.

910
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,440
We learned our lesson
with that the last time, right?

911
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:29,120
Just think about it, all right?

912
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:38,960
- Doing all right, George?
- Yeah.

913
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,080
Look a little bummed out.

914
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,360
Listen, I'll step in and partner with you.

915
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:46,440
Me and you could win this thing,
you know?

916
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,040
- Why not?
- Yeah.

917
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,240
Great.

918
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,560
Watch your fingers there.

919
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:18,160
- Hello?
- Clare?

920
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,840
Dennis. I think you should come over.

921
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,400
Yeah, of course, Dennis. I'll come now.

922
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,800
- How much was in here?
- Two hundred pounds.

923
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:32,880
We called the school. He never got there.

924
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,840
What happens now?

925
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,240
Well, we don't want to
involve the police.

926
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:39,320
No, that's really a last resort.

927
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,320
Will you let us know if he comes back?

928
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,880
We will be in touch.

929
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,320
I'll see you out.

930
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,280
There you go.

931
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:17,840
I'm afraid our sensitive,
Mr. Hewitt, is very busy.

932
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,720
Earliest he could see you
is six weeks' time.

933
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,240
Oh, dear.

934
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,400
Mrs. Joyce, our senior sensitive...

935
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,400
...is doing a public reading tonight
if you're interested.

936
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,280
In the lecture hall.

937
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:32,480
All right. I'll try my luck. Thank you.

938
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,320
Can I help you?

939
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,280
Oh, no, thanks.

940
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:42,800
I'm getting a strong feeling
over this side of the room.

941
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:47,040
Someone whose name starts with a "J."

942
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:52,560
Does the letter "J" mean anything
to anyone? Anyone?

943
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,440
Anyone?

944
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,160
Oh.

945
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,320
Don't be shy.

946
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,120
Tell us your name, please.

947
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,320
Marcus.

948
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:07,560
Marcus. Marcus. Come on.

949
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,760
Come up here where I can see you.

950
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,280
Good boy.

951
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:17,280
There's a good boy, Marcus.
That's right. I'm not going to hurt you.

952
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,920
That's lovely.

953
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:24,440
Now, Marcus,
you've lost someone recently.

954
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,440
Was it someone very close to you?

955
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:33,120
He's telling me his name.
It's Joe, or Jack.

956
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,200
- Jason.
- Jason, that's it.

957
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:38,640
He was very close to you, wasn't he?
Was he part of your family?

958
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,360
Is it your dad?

959
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:50,000
Well, Daddy says please don't be sad...

960
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:53,040
...and to look after Mummy
for him, will you?

961
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,280
Will you do that for him?

962
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,480
Give Marcus a round of applause,
ladies and gentlemen.

963
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:03,800
Lovely boy.

964
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:06,440
And as I go into a trance...

965
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:11,080
...my spirit guide will speak to you
through me.

966
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:15,880
Oh.

967
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:21,160
Who summons me from the spirit world?

968
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:23,680
Say your name.

969
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,520
- Marcus.
- Marcus.

970
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:31,840
Welcome, Marcus. My name is Yoshi.

971
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:36,560
What I'm doing is I'm adjusting
the level of the microphones.

972
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,320
Do you do physics at school?

973
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:41,600
Good. Then you know that all matter
vibrates at different speeds.

974
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:45,320
But in the spirit world,
operates at far higher levels.

975
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:48,080
So we can't hear them.
Not with our normal hearing.

976
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:51,320
So, what we really need
is an omnidirectional...

977
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,280
...supercardioid condenser microphone.

978
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:56,320
Like this beauty.

979
01:25:56,640 --> 01:26:00,360
Right. I think we are ready.

980
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:04,680
And....

981
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:12,400
Jason? Are you there?

982
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:19,200
Your brother, Marcus, is here.
Is there a message for him?

983
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:25,200
It was the ancient Greeks
who first discovered it.

984
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,880
"psychomanteum," they called it.

985
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:32,520
The reflective surface
being the conduit to the afterlife.

986
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,600
Nowadays, we call it "mirror gazing."

987
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,120
You might not be able to speak to him,
but you will see him...

988
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,480
...if you really want to, that is.

989
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,880
Did you see him?

990
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,400
No.

991
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,880
Hello. Clare speaking.

992
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:55,360
There's no sign of him.
I'm gonna call the police.

993
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,400
- But that will not help.
- Well, I don't care what--

994
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:02,200
Hang on. He's here.
I'll call you right back.

995
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:07,040
I'm sorry.

996
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:08,520
Ah--

997
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:10,920
Leave him be.

998
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:20,480
Watch out!

999
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:31,040
Excuse me.

1000
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:50,120
Sorry, we are running a little late.

1001
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:51,320
Come in.

1002
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:54,400
Everyone is upset by the events.

1003
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:00,040
Sit down.

1004
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:06,000
Marie, to be honest with you,
I'm a bit confused.

1005
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:09,080
I thought we commissioned a book
about Francois Mitterrand.

1006
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:11,840
Instead, you give us
the first three chapters of...

1007
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:13,080
...Hereafter:

1008
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:16,440
The Conspiracy of Silence.

1009
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:20,160
I realize it's not
what you were expecting.

1010
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:23,720
You always said there weren't
enough surprises in publishing.

1011
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:26,000
Well, this is certainly a surprise!

1012
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:33,840
I don't know where to begin.

1013
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,520
Did you at least find it interesting?

1014
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:39,480
Of course.
You've always had a nose for a good story.

1015
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:41,440
But we're a political publisher--

1016
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:42,840
This is political!

1017
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:47,240
This kind of material, however fascinating,
is for a specialized market.

1018
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:50,440
This morning, in London,
six bombs went off in the heart of the city.

1019
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:55,040
Apparently coordinated, the bombs
exploded at the height of the rush hour.

1020
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,080
Why are you all against this?

1021
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:10,640
Why are you so afraid of this?

1022
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:12,560
This is real!

1023
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:15,760
This is scientific evidence...

1024
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,920
...from well-known researchers
forced to work in secret.

1025
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:24,080
A Nobel prize winner, hounded
by the religious lobby. That's a story!

1026
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:28,360
Better than a philandering,
dishonest old politician.

1027
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:32,320
But a book like that would probably
have to be written in English...

1028
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:34,240
...for the American market.

1029
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:37,160
It happened to me, Michel.

1030
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,920
I saw it with my own eyes.

1031
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:43,760
Where we're going.

1032
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:47,440
What we'll experience.

1033
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,200
Each and every one of us.

1034
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:55,120
That doesn't interest you?

1035
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:02,880
Now listen, we commissioned a book
about Francois Mitterrand.

1036
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:05,920
Either we agree on this
and you start writing it...

1037
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:08,920
...or else I want my money back.
That's all I can say.

1038
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,360
It was so humiliating.

1039
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,640
They looked at me as if I'd lost my mind.

1040
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,600
Six months ago they begged me
to write about anything.

1041
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,920
Anything by the great Marie Lelay.

1042
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:50,320
You'd better give me my job back.
I've had enough with being humiliated.

1043
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:56,000
Today, they even took down my posters.

1044
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,840
Why didn't you tell me?

1045
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,400
And your book?

1046
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:10,000
I'll finish it in my spare time.
It's caused me enough trouble as it is.

1047
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:14,520
What's the matter?

1048
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:16,920
Look...

1049
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:19,800
...getting your job back...

1050
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,160
...might not be as easy as you think.

1051
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:24,160
Why?

1052
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:27,160
It was a temporary break.
And on your advice.

1053
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:29,000
I know, but--

1054
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:31,720
What we couldn't have foreseen is...

1055
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:34,880
...you'd be talking in public
about these experiences.

1056
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:39,280
- That you'd lose your credibility.
- But I didn't want to write this book!

1057
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:41,040
It was your idea!

1058
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,680
It was my idea you should write
about Mitterrand.

1059
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,520
So, what are you saying?

1060
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:50,360
I'm saying take some more time.

1061
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,560
Finish the book, get it out
of your system, then come back.

1062
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:56,880
It's that girl, isn't it?
My replacement?

1063
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,520
I've watched her a few times.
She's good.

1064
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,520
Yes, she is.
But not as good as you.

1065
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:06,760
You're sleeping with her?

1066
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:09,960
How can you say such a thing?

1067
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:15,240
You always told me to ask
the tough questions.

1068
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:34,120
It's funny....

1069
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,400
Who'd have thought it?

1070
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,720
A few months ago I was famous.

1071
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:44,080
Rich.

1072
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:47,120
A success story.

1073
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:50,920
I was happy.

1074
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,720
Fulfilled by my work.

1075
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:57,720
By you.

1076
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:16,240
All this happened because
you didn't buy your kids their gifts.

1077
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:17,880
Because of what?

1078
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:20,640
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

1079
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:23,920
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

1080
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:50,280
It's Michel.

1081
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:53,120
Listen....

1082
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:57,360
I feel terrible about our meeting
earlier today.

1083
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,720
This book is obviously
very important to you.

1084
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:06,880
I think everyone was a bit on edge
because of the events in London.

1085
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:13,960
But I made a few calls. There are
two publishers who might be interested.

1086
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:16,600
One American, one English.

1087
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:18,800
Do you have a pen?

1088
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:28,040
I'm listening.

1089
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,240
Anyways, I thought this would be
a good group reading room.

1090
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:54,400
Group reading?

1091
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:57,080
Yeah, where you could
read more people at once.

1092
01:36:57,240 --> 01:37:00,600
Up to 20 people or more, it's up to you.
They'd pay lower rates that way.

1093
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:02,840
This would be your personal
consulting room.

1094
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:07,280
And right next door, George,
this is gonna be my room.

1095
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:09,880
I'm gonna make sure
everything gets taken care of.

1096
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:11,520
You won't have to worry.

1097
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:14,520
I don't understand.
What about your other businesses?

1098
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:16,440
Oh, yeah, of course. They're gone.

1099
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:18,760
Once this thing takes off,
forget it, you know?

1100
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:21,800
Let's get you home. You need rest.
You got a big day tomorrow.

1101
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:23,840
You already have three appointments.

1102
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:25,360
- All right?
- Yeah.

1103
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:26,880
Come on.

1104
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,640
- You Billy Lonegan?
- Yes.

1105
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:57,920
Before he went, your brother
asked me to give this to you.

1106
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:59,600
Went? Went where?

1107
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:01,240
I have no idea.

1108
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:09,000
Dear Billy...

1109
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:10,760
...I'm sorry.

1110
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:14,040
I guess there's nothing I'll ever
be able to say to persuade you...

1111
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:16,720
...that what I have isn't a gift,
but a curse.

1112
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:20,640
I know you feel what I have
comes with a duty to help others

1113
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:24,240
But right now, the person
I most need to help is myself.

1114
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,840
So I've decided to take some time out.

1115
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:29,960
I don't know what the future will bring
or when I'll be back.

1116
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:32,600
So don't wait up, so to speak.

1117
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:36,640
Love to Jenni and the kids
Your baby brother, George.

1118
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:54,120
You know the recovery rate
in substance abuse cases like this.

1119
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:56,880
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Very low.

1120
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:01,200
So, what's the best way forward?
Are you okay for a little bit longer?

1121
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:06,240
Yes. But not too long, please.

1122
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:09,880
We're running out of ideas,
and it's beginning to take its toll.

1123
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,720
Taking him to see
our previous child, Ricky.

1124
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:17,560
Who knows, you know?
One kid talking to another.

1125
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:32,120
- Marie Lelay?
- Yes?

1126
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:36,480
This is Richard Aronson
of Aquarius Books in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

1127
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:37,960
Excuse me?

1128
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:41,800
Aquarius books in Santa Fe?
A few months ago, you sent us your book.

1129
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,080
I'm just ringing to say
how much we liked it.

1130
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:47,600
Sorry it's taken so long, but we loved it,
and we'd like to publish it.

1131
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:49,880
- Really?
- In fact, we'd like to print it...

1132
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:53,040
...in time for a book fair in London
in the spring.

1133
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:55,320
- You're based in Paris?
- Yes

1134
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:58,840
So, if we were to ask
going to London wouldn't be inconvenient?

1135
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,960
No. No, no, no, not at all.

1136
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:03,640
That would be a good opportunity
to do some publicity.

1137
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:06,800
Maybe a reading. It's an incredible story.

1138
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:08,720
Thank you.

1139
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:16,280
And here we are.

1140
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:20,720
48 Doughty Street.

1141
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:22,640
Charles Dickens' home in London...

1142
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:26,680
...where he lived with his wife Catherine
and their children.

1143
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,480
Anyone know how many children?

1144
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:33,360
Here we are in the main hallway.

1145
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:36,000
- This is the view that greeted the author...
- Ten.

1146
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:37,880
...as he walked in each time.

1147
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:40,840
Everything has been preserved
exactly as it was.

1148
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:45,200
So just follow me up the stairs.
We'll start at the top of the house.

1149
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:51,080
Now we move in to Dickens' study.

1150
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:55,160
And directly in front of you, you'll see
an original copy of A Christmas Carol...

1151
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:58,520
...arguably one of Dickens'
most famous books.

1152
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:02,160
But over here, the thing I expect
most of you have come to see.

1153
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,520
Dickens' desk,
where he wrote most of his books.

1154
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:09,920
On this wall we have several illustrations
for The Mystery of Edwin Drood...

1155
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:13,120
...the novel Dickens was writing
at the time of his death.

1156
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:17,800
And on the far wall here,
a painting loved by Dickens fans.

1157
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,400
It shows the author asleep at his desk...

1158
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:23,680
...with characters from his novels
floating in the air around him.

1159
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:27,320
Anyone know its name?

1160
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:29,200
Dickens' Dream.

1161
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:32,520
It's called Dickens' Dream.

1162
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:37,120
This way, please.

1163
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:42,880
Just gather again at the front
of the building.

1164
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,040
Does anyone have any questions?

1165
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:58,320
What is the date today?

1166
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:01,840
- Fourteenth.
- It is the 14th. Yeah, okay.

1167
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:07,280
I think you'll like Ricky.

1168
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:11,160
He was about your age when he first
came to us, and just as shy.

1169
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:16,080
Now he's a grown man.
With a job and his own flat.

1170
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:23,160
- He's in here somewhere.
- He said he'd meet us at the front.

1171
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:25,200
Where is he?

1172
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:28,200
- Where is he?
- Hey. Look at this.

1173
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:30,080
- Hey.
- Heh, heh, heh.

1174
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:35,480
Oh, my God, I hardly recognized you.

1175
01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:38,480
- You gonna arrest us?
- Yeah. Not if you behave yourself.

1176
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:40,680
Marcus, this is Ricky.

1177
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:42,600
You all right, mate?

1178
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:43,920
Fancy a coffee first?

1179
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:46,240
- Yeah, that's a great idea.
- Yeah, great idea.

1180
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:49,160
It's an amazing place, isn't it?

1181
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:50,640
Can I have a look around?

1182
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:55,160
Yeah. But meet us back here
in one hour, yeah?

1183
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:57,440
- Good lad.
- Okay?

1184
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:04,200
It's been nearly a year.
He hardly speaks to us.

1185
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:05,960
Neither did I, remember?

1186
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:08,960
This one's different. He's not like you.

1187
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:11,880
- Let's have that coffee, yeah?
- Yeah.

1188
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:13,800
Oh, lovely.

1189
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:32,360
"'She is,
I do assure you, the winegariest person.'

1190
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:37,640
Mr. plornish, with a modest
disavowal of his merits...

1191
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:40,560
...opened the room door
for her readmission...

1192
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:44,160
...and followed her in with such
an exceedingly bald presence...

1193
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:46,400
...of not having been out at all...

1194
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:50,440
...that her father might have observed it
without being very suspicious.

1195
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:55,080
In his affable unconsciousness,
however, he took no heed.

1196
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:59,360
plornish, after the little conversation,
took his leave.

1197
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:01,880
Making the tour of the prison
before he left...

1198
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:04,880
...and looking on at a game of skittles...

1199
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:07,400
...with the mixed feelings
of an old inhabitant...

1200
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:10,800
...who had his private reasons
for believing...

1201
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:16,240
...that it might be his destiny
to come back again."

1202
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:21,280
Thank you.

1203
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:24,080
Thank you.

1204
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:28,920
Now, if any of you wish to purchase a CD,
I am at your disposal.

1205
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:31,080
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1206
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:32,920
- Hello.
- Hi. George.

1207
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:34,640
- To George.
- Yeah. George Lonegan.

1208
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:36,000
To George.

1209
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:39,480
I'm a-- It's-- This is an honor, Mr. Jacobi.

1210
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:42,280
I'm a really big fan. You have no idea.

1211
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:44,440
Thank you.
You're a long way from home.

1212
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:46,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

1213
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:50,320
- Did you enjoy it?
- Very much, yes.

1214
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:55,480
- There you are. Thank you.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

1215
01:44:55,720 --> 01:44:57,640
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1216
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,960
"I felt connected to another world...

1217
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:06,840
...a place of utter peace and tranquility.

1218
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:12,560
Whether what I saw was a genuine
glimpse of the afterlife...

1219
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:16,200
...or just a concussed fantasy,
I'll probably never know.

1220
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:21,840
I arrive at the end of my journey
with as many question as I started with.

1221
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:29,600
I certainly never imagined
I would be exposed...

1222
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:33,120
...to that kind of prejudice
and close-mindedness.

1223
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:36,280
We obviously still have
a long way to go...

1224
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:40,600
...before we will be able to deal
with death and what follows...

1225
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,880
...in anything approaching
a sensible fashion."

1226
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:51,840
Okay, so if you want to buy my book,
I can sign it.

1227
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:53,760
You're welcome. Thank you.

1228
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,040
- Hello. What's your name?
- Hello.

1229
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:05,120
- Maria.
- Maria.

1230
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:13,520
- Thank you, Maria.
- Thank you very much.

1231
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:16,120
- Michael.
- Michael. Okay.

1232
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,200
Thank you.

1233
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:26,320
Honora.

1234
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:32,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1235
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:34,880
- My name's George.
- George.

1236
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:57,080
- To penny.
- Sorry?

1237
01:46:57,240 --> 01:46:58,640
- penny.
- penny.

1238
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:08,200
Wait a minute. I recognize you.

1239
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:09,520
Sorry?

1240
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:11,400
You're that psychic.

1241
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:16,280
No, no. Um.... No, you got me mistaken
with someone else.

1242
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:18,400
Yes, you are. You're George Lonegan.

1243
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:22,400
- I don't even know who that is. No, I'm not.
- You are George Lonegan.

1244
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:24,840
- You got me--
- I need to talk to you.

1245
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,760
No, you got me mixed up
with someone else.

1246
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:30,240
please, I need to talk to you.
You're a psychic.

1247
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:32,200
I'm not. I'm not who you think I am.

1248
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:35,800
I saw it on the Internet.
You are a psychic.

1249
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,800
What? What is it? What do you want?

1250
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:42,040
If it's a reading, I have news for you.
I don't do it anymore.

1251
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:44,280
Now leave me alone.

1252
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:51,200
"When I look back on this, it was insane.

1253
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:54,680
The rudder cables became useless
and I lost my ability to steer.

1254
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:58,480
I was helpless amid the swirling
maritime mass of industry.

1255
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:01,280
The sea had turned malevolently dark.

1256
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:05,760
What had once seemed friendly was now
a violent monster trying to kill me."

1257
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:09,640
Did you see a Frenchwoman who was
here just a few minutes ago?

1258
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:12,120
She's gone. She left already.

1259
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:15,240
"You realize you're in danger...

1260
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:18,600
...and dwell on how things might end.
I spent every second...."

1261
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,160
- Hi, can I help you?
- I'm looking for someone.

1262
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:21,080
Come on, please. Move along.

1263
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:46,720
Hill cuts it back nicely,
perhaps almost too far.

1264
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:50,040
But it's gone in! It's gone in!

1265
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:52,600
Andy Fisher!

1266
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:55,320
You have to question that play....

1267
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:10,360
Okay.

1268
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:13,720
We better get you inside.

1269
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:18,520
Come on.

1270
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:24,480
- What's your name?
- Marcus.

1271
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:40,320
Okay. Couple of ground rules
before we get started.

1272
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:42,520
I'm sorry about the woman.

1273
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:43,800
What woman?

1274
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,960
The woman at the book fair.

1275
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:49,120
I could tell you liked her.

1276
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:50,640
No, I didn't.

1277
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:53,800
Yes, you did.
So I'm sorry for taking you away.

1278
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:58,360
I don't have any idea what you're
talking about. Here, sit down.

1279
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:01,520
Okay.

1280
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:03,960
Let's do this.

1281
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:07,760
Okay, I'm gonna grab your hands
because it seems to help...

1282
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:09,560
...and then I'll let go.

1283
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:14,480
Don't worry, I'm not gonna go into
any stupid trance or anything like that.

1284
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:18,320
I just gotta grab them to get a connection,
then I'll let go. Okay?

1285
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:21,960
Now, I want you to answer yes or no
to everything I ask.

1286
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:24,360
- You understand?
- Yes.

1287
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:26,080
Okay.

1288
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:28,960
Let's see them.

1289
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:43,400
Okay.

1290
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,520
Okay, someone close to you
has passed away?

1291
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:50,520
Yes.

1292
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:52,360
A male?

1293
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:55,560
Yes.

1294
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:58,480
He was young when he died.

1295
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:00,200
Yes.

1296
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:03,160
This person your brother?

1297
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:09,560
Older brother.

1298
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:15,160
But not by much, he says.

1299
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:19,000
Only by a few minutes.

1300
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:23,560
I'm sorry, kid.

1301
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:31,320
I gotta concentrate.
This guy.... This guy talks a lot.

1302
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:33,440
Talks fast.

1303
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:35,840
Got a really weird laugh.

1304
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:39,440
Okay. Ahem. He says...

1305
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:42,880
...there's so much he wants to tell you.

1306
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:46,280
You wouldn't believe how it is.

1307
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:49,240
How you can be all things...

1308
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:52,320
...and all at once.

1309
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:56,080
And the weightlessness.

1310
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:58,600
He says that's cool.

1311
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:01,160
Now he's laughing.

1312
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:04,800
He's got a funny laugh.

1313
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:06,600
Um....

1314
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:08,880
Okay.

1315
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:15,400
He says how you
always looked up to him...

1316
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:19,880
...and relied on him
to make the decision...

1317
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:23,280
...how maybe you used that
as an excuse.

1318
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:26,080
Is that true?

1319
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:29,840
Okay. He says can't do that anymore.

1320
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:34,080
Now you're on your own.

1321
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,680
Okay, now, hang on, okay, now.
Now he's saying something about a hat.

1322
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:42,200
The cap?

1323
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:44,680
A cap. Okay.

1324
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:51,640
He says to take it off right now.
Take it off.

1325
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:56,640
He doesn't--
He's telling you not to wear it again...

1326
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:00,120
...because it was his.

1327
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:04,800
And that's why he knocked it off
your head that day?

1328
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:09,520
At the tube? Do you know
what he's talking about?

1329
01:54:11,560 --> 01:54:13,000
Okay.

1330
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:17,520
He says good thing he did too.

1331
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:26,720
And that's the last time
he's ever looking out for you.

1332
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:30,040
I'm sorry. I'm, uh....

1333
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:38,480
I'm sorry, I'm losing him now.
He's leaving. He wants to leave.

1334
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:44,640
No, Jase.

1335
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:46,920
Don't go.

1336
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:50,720
You can't. Don't leave me.

1337
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:53,000
I don't wanna be here without you.

1338
01:54:54,040 --> 01:54:56,880
please, Jase, don't go. I miss you.

1339
01:54:57,040 --> 01:55:00,720
Okay, he came back. He's here. He says...

1340
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:07,200
...if you're worried about being
on your own, don't be.

1341
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:09,280
You're not.

1342
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:13,600
Because he is you and you are him.

1343
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:16,200
One cell.

1344
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:17,960
One person.

1345
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:21,080
Always.

1346
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:23,280
I miss you.

1347
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:28,120
please, Jase, don't go.
please come back.

1348
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:29,920
I miss you so badly.

1349
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:36,800
Okay, wait. He's leaving again.
Hold on, hold on. I'm sorry.

1350
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:38,280
Well, where's he gone?

1351
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:43,040
I'm sorry, kid. I don't know.

1352
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:46,240
But you've done all those readings.

1353
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:49,800
I still don't know.

1354
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:52,920
Sorry.

1355
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:04,200
Okay. We better get you home.

1356
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:56,320
- Hello?
- May Fair.

1357
01:56:57,240 --> 01:56:58,280
What?

1358
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:02,760
The hotel where she's staying.
The woman you like?

1359
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:05,880
What are you talking about?

1360
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:09,480
Well, I rang up the publisher
and said I heard her speak...

1361
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:13,000
...wanted to drop off a letter
saying how interesting it was.

1362
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:14,880
Anyway, that's the name.

1363
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:16,200
May Fair.

1364
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:20,160
Okay, well, that's really interesting,
but what does that have to do with me?

1365
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:23,160
Hello?

1366
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:30,320
Well, I'll be.

1367
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:43,880
I must be crazy.

1368
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:47,160
Morning, sir.

1369
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:53,120
Okay.

1370
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:56,760
- Here's your room key. Enjoy your stay.
- Thank you very much.

1371
01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:02,120
Hi. I'm looking for a guest. Marie Lelay?

1372
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:04,520
Okay. Okay.

1373
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:13,120
No, there's no answer from the room,
I'm afraid, sir.

1374
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:15,440
Would you like to leave a message?

1375
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:18,320
No.

1376
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:23,200
Actually, you know what? I would, I would.
Do you have a pen and paper?

1377
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:24,880
Sure.

1378
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:28,400
- pen, paper.
- Thank you.

1379
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:30,360
You're welcome.

1380
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:44,120
Thank you.

1381
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:48,840
This is it.

1382
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:53,680
Marcus? Good luck.

1383
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:19,960
Come here.

1384
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:23,360
I missed you so much.

1385
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:25,560
Oh, Marcus.

1386
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:31,240
Come here. I missed you so much.

1387
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:52,520
Marie?

1388
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:10,960
- Hello.
- Hello.
