1
00:00:45,508 --> 00:00:47,218
Come on, get up.

2
00:00:48,344 --> 00:00:51,055
You need to buy gifts for your kids
before we leave.

3
00:00:51,222 --> 00:00:53,182
I'll pick up something at the airport.

4
00:00:53,349 --> 00:00:54,392
No way.

5
00:00:55,142 --> 00:00:56,602
Airport gifts suck.

6
00:00:56,769 --> 00:00:59,397
Marie, please let me sleep
another half hour.

7
00:01:00,898 --> 00:01:01,983
Fine.

8
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,070
If you won't buy the gifts
for your kids, I will.

9
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:11,450
Can you ask the front desk
to prepare the bill...

10
00:01:11,617 --> 00:01:13,744
...and have some breakfast sent up?

11
00:01:13,911 --> 00:01:17,832
You know what?
The posters are up, all over Paris.

12
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:19,625
Apparently, you can't miss them.

13
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:33,681
How many have you seen?

14
00:01:34,807 --> 00:01:35,850
Really?

15
00:01:45,568 --> 00:01:48,112
They said there would be
120 across Paris.

16
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:52,992
Can you sum up the headlines for me?
I won't have time to go online.

17
00:01:54,827 --> 00:01:56,245
That's good.

18
00:01:58,581 --> 00:01:59,957
Big kisses, bye-bye.

19
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:59,145
I feel bad. I should've stayed on
to cover the story.

20
00:25:59,645 --> 00:26:01,481
After what happened to you?

21
00:26:02,148 --> 00:26:04,317
They've sent a crew
from the Hong Kong office.

22
00:26:05,818 --> 00:26:07,487
I've never done that...

23
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:09,155
...run away from such a story.

24
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,210
-You okay?
-Yeah.

25
00:27:04,377 --> 00:27:06,129
-Should I come up?
-No, I'll be fine.

26
00:27:06,295 --> 00:27:07,922
I almost forgot...

27
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:09,507
...the gifts for your kids.

28
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:12,802
I love you.

29
00:27:48,087 --> 00:27:51,841
The estimated figures are
at several billion dollars.

30
00:27:52,008 --> 00:27:53,926
But of course, we're going to talk
about the survivors...

31
00:27:54,093 --> 00:27:56,596
...because we hope there are survivors.

32
00:27:56,762 --> 00:28:01,601
The number of victims is estimated
at several hundred thousand.

33
00:28:02,435 --> 00:28:07,023
It is a horrific scene here,
as this tsunami...

34
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,983
...has devastated the population.

35
00:28:33,966 --> 00:28:35,676
Good evening, everyone.

36
00:29:02,036 --> 00:29:03,412
Marie, can you hear me?

37
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:10,169
Everybody, break a leg.
Ready and on the air in...

38
00:29:10,336 --> 00:29:11,963
...five, four...

39
00:29:12,129 --> 00:29:13,714
...three, two...

40
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,591
...and cue, Miss Lelay.

41
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:19,345
Good evening,
and welcome to a new edition...

42
00:29:19,512 --> 00:29:21,097
...of Window on Events.

43
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,058
Tonight, our guest is
Guillaume Belcher...

44
00:29:24,225 --> 00:29:28,521
...CEO of famous
clothing manufacturer Soucil.

45
00:29:28,688 --> 00:29:32,441
We're going to present to you
a shocking investigation...

46
00:29:32,608 --> 00:29:36,696
...on child labor in their factories
in Southeast Asia.

47
00:29:37,363 --> 00:29:39,323
Cyril Guignard reporting.

48
00:29:40,574 --> 00:29:44,996
Here in the West, it's easy to criticize
Third World labor practices.

49
00:29:47,873 --> 00:29:50,001
But the truth is...

50
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:51,210
...these factories...

51
00:29:51,377 --> 00:29:54,922
...play a vital role in
industrial development...

52
00:29:55,089 --> 00:29:57,758
...and evolution of poorer countries.

53
00:29:59,385 --> 00:30:02,805
And let's be clear about this,
the wages we are paying...

54
00:30:03,222 --> 00:30:06,517
...are substantially higher
than local wages.

55
00:30:06,684 --> 00:30:08,394
Marie, go at him!

56
00:30:20,406 --> 00:30:21,741
Marie, do you hear me?

57
00:30:22,742 --> 00:30:24,243
Pull this guy apart!

58
00:30:24,577 --> 00:30:26,245
You hear me, get him!

59
00:30:29,415 --> 00:30:35,463
But will this kind of justification satisfy
French customers...

60
00:30:36,255 --> 00:30:37,506
...Mr. Belcher?

61
00:30:37,673 --> 00:30:40,926
If they were aware of the conditions
under which the clothes are produced...

62
00:30:41,093 --> 00:30:44,513
...do you think you would
still be profitable?

63
00:30:45,473 --> 00:30:49,393
Go there and you'll see how much
these people need us.

64
00:30:53,981 --> 00:30:55,608
Thank you for watching.

65
00:30:55,775 --> 00:30:58,027
That's all for now, see you next week.

66
00:31:04,617 --> 00:31:07,036
I'm sorry, that was unforgivable.

67
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,455
We'll fix it in the edit. No one will notice.

68
00:31:10,164 --> 00:31:11,290
And it was my fault.

69
00:31:11,457 --> 00:31:14,418
A defensive CEO was a tough start
for the new season.

70
00:31:15,961 --> 00:31:17,797
Do you want to get something to eat?

71
00:31:22,927 --> 00:31:24,136
I'll see you tomorrow.

72
00:31:31,143 --> 00:31:33,145
I think something happened
to me out there.

73
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:35,314
You had a close call.

74
00:31:35,481 --> 00:31:37,566
No, something really happened to me.

75
00:31:38,943 --> 00:31:40,152
When I went underwater...

76
00:31:42,696 --> 00:31:44,198
...I had visions.

77
00:31:47,743 --> 00:31:49,453
I don't know.

78
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,831
You had a concussion.
You hit your head.

79
00:31:56,669 --> 00:31:58,087
You're right.

80
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:15,020
Two right-wing newspapers claim Sikhs
were out in the streets...

81
00:32:15,729 --> 00:32:17,857
...burning cars, looting shops.

82
00:32:19,108 --> 00:32:23,529
Others say the unrest was triggered by
elements within the nationalist parties...

83
00:32:24,196 --> 00:32:27,032
...10 cast negative suspicion
on racial minorities.

84
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:29,618
What do you think about
the story on the Sikhs?

85
00:32:29,785 --> 00:32:31,036
What?

86
00:32:31,203 --> 00:32:32,872
The story on the Sikhs,
what do you think?

87
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:34,707
It's very good.

88
00:32:37,918 --> 00:32:40,796
Listen, I've got to work late
and finish some things.

89
00:32:41,714 --> 00:32:43,257
See you tomorrow.

90
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,263
Can I say something...

91
00:32:51,724 --> 00:32:53,893
...you might find difficult to hear?

92
00:32:54,768 --> 00:32:57,229
I think you came back to work too soon.

93
00:32:57,396 --> 00:33:00,816
Physically, you're fine.
But since the accident...

94
00:33:02,401 --> 00:33:05,738
Take some time off
to get over what happened.

95
00:33:05,905 --> 00:33:07,740
Just a couple of weeks.

96
00:33:07,907 --> 00:33:09,158
N
To "get over"?

97
00:33:09,325 --> 00:33:11,410
You've always said you wanted to write.

98
00:33:11,577 --> 00:33:14,538
Your book idea, Michel would jump on it
and pay good money.

99
00:33:15,956 --> 00:33:17,583
But that would take time.

100
00:33:19,793 --> 00:33:22,296
This will all be here waiting for you.

101
00:33:23,422 --> 00:33:25,799
What matters is that you feel better.

102
00:33:25,966 --> 00:33:27,760
We need you too much.

103
00:33:29,303 --> 00:33:31,096
I'll think about it.

104
00:47:09,164 --> 00:47:13,752
Summing up France's postwar history,
only two statesmen counted:

105
00:47:13,918 --> 00:47:15,545
De Gaulle and him.

106
00:47:15,712 --> 00:47:20,592
On DE Gaulle, everything's been written.
On Mitterrand, I want to finish the job.

107
00:47:20,759 --> 00:47:22,427
There are fascinating elements.

108
00:47:22,594 --> 00:47:24,846
The abolition of the death penalty,
the European Union.

109
00:47:25,013 --> 00:47:27,349
Coming from a right-wing family,
he seduced the left.

110
00:47:27,515 --> 00:47:29,517
And what's more,
converted it to liberalism.

111
00:47:29,684 --> 00:47:32,020
Amazing! It was a revolution, right?

112
00:47:32,187 --> 00:47:36,191
Plus the darker sides of his character
that have never been explored.

113
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:40,236
He's been dead for 10 years.
The timing is right, we can dig deeper.

114
00:47:40,403 --> 00:47:41,863
I want to dig into his past.

115
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:44,991
Vichy, the Elf scandal...
What part did he play?

116
00:47:45,158 --> 00:47:47,118
The Taiwan frigates,
the Papon scandal...

117
00:47:47,285 --> 00:47:48,661
...Mazarine, Marguerite Duras.

118
00:47:48,828 --> 00:47:51,998
These stories were never really addressed.
They've all been buried.

119
00:47:52,165 --> 00:47:54,584
I'm going to tell who knew,
who didn't talk.

120
00:47:54,751 --> 00:47:57,504
Isn't that going to bring us
too much controversy?

121
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:59,297
I don't think so.

122
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,008
What I want is a book
that can be read by all.

123
00:48:02,175 --> 00:48:04,969
Mitterrand was not just a politician.

124
00:48:05,553 --> 00:48:07,555
Mitterrand was an icon.

125
00:48:07,722 --> 00:48:09,641
He's "Tonton," our uncle!

126
00:48:09,808 --> 00:48:12,018
Maybe that's what we should use
as the title!

127
00:48:12,185 --> 00:48:13,645
Tonton.

128
00:48:19,234 --> 00:48:21,319
I'm not sure we can keep that title.

129
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:26,491
Of course not. It was a joke.

130
00:48:26,658 --> 00:48:29,202
I'll welcome your suggestions
for the title.

131
00:48:29,369 --> 00:48:34,249
How about Chipping Away at the Myth
or The Vacillating Statue?

132
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:36,876
I look forward to your suggestions.

133
00:48:37,043 --> 00:48:38,503
We'll make a list.

134
00:48:46,928 --> 00:48:48,054
Congratulations.

135
00:48:49,222 --> 00:48:51,433
The timing couldn't be better.

136
00:48:51,891 --> 00:48:54,644
Politically, there's nothing going on
now anyway.

137
00:48:54,811 --> 00:48:58,064
You'll write the book you've always
wanted to. You'll get some rest.

138
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:02,193
Come this summer,
you'll be back on the air...

139
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,947
...with a bestseller under your belt,
and a big renegotiated contract.

140
00:49:07,365 --> 00:49:08,741
Stronger than ever.

141
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:10,076
Exactly.

142
00:49:10,243 --> 00:49:12,704
Adapting and turning misfortune
to your advantage.

143
00:49:13,288 --> 00:49:16,833
That's what I've always loved about you,
never a victim.

144
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,334
That's right.

145
00:49:18,501 --> 00:49:22,547
Never a victim, never vulnerable,
never complains.

146
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:26,134
Excuse me. Your table is ready.

147
00:49:26,718 --> 00:49:29,095
Great. I'm starving.

148
00:49:34,601 --> 00:49:36,269
Can I ask you something?

149
00:49:36,436 --> 00:49:39,314
What do you think happens
when we die?

150
00:49:39,481 --> 00:49:40,940
That's a strange question!

151
00:49:41,107 --> 00:49:42,484
Tell me.

152
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:45,445
When you die, you die.
The lights go out, that's it.

153
00:49:45,612 --> 00:49:47,030
Why?

154
00:49:49,491 --> 00:49:52,076
That's it? Just blackout?

155
00:49:52,243 --> 00:49:55,330
Totally black, the plug's pulled out.

156
00:49:55,497 --> 00:49:56,873
The eternal void.

157
00:50:00,168 --> 00:50:02,670
Don't you think it's possible
that there is something?

158
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,172
Like what?

159
00:50:04,339 --> 00:50:06,758
I don't know, something...

160
00:50:08,551 --> 00:50:09,719
A hereafter.

161
00:50:11,054 --> 00:50:12,680
No, I don't.

162
00:50:12,847 --> 00:50:16,601
If that were the case, wouldn't someone
have discovered it by now?

163
00:50:16,768 --> 00:50:18,770
And there would be proof.

164
00:50:21,439 --> 00:50:22,774
I guess.

165
00:50:24,943 --> 00:50:27,111
Do you have a lot of questions like that?

166
00:50:30,073 --> 00:50:31,366
More champagne?

167
01:19:21,010 --> 01:19:22,053
Good evening.

168
01:19:22,262 --> 01:19:26,015
Following a joint statement by Vivendi
and electricity giant VFM...

169
01:19:26,182 --> 01:19:28,768
...announcing higher than expected
quarterly profits...

170
01:19:28,935 --> 01:19:34,274
...we wonder if evoking France's economic
downturn might be premature?

171
01:29:48,762 --> 01:29:50,598
Sorry, we are running a little late.

172
01:29:50,764 --> 01:29:51,807
Come in.

173
01:29:51,974 --> 01:29:54,894
Everyone is upset by the events.

174
01:29:59,315 --> 01:30:00,524
Sit down.

175
01:30:03,736 --> 01:30:06,488
Marie, to be honest with you,
I'm a bit confused.

176
01:30:07,489 --> 01:30:09,575
I thought we commissioned a book
about Francois Mitterrand.

177
01:30:09,742 --> 01:30:12,328
Instead, you give us
the first three chapters of...

178
01:30:12,494 --> 01:30:13,579
...Hereafter:

179
01:30:15,164 --> 01:30:16,916
The Conspiracy of Silence.

180
01:30:17,082 --> 01:30:20,669
I realize it's not
what you were expecting.

181
01:30:21,253 --> 01:30:24,173
You always said there weren't
enough surprises in publishing.

182
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:26,508
Well, this is certainly a surprise!

183
01:30:32,139 --> 01:30:34,350
I don't know where to begin.

184
01:30:34,516 --> 01:30:36,018
Did you at least find it interesting?

185
01:30:36,185 --> 01:30:39,980
Of course.
You've always had a nose for a good story.

186
01:30:40,147 --> 01:30:41,941
But we're a political publisher--

187
01:30:42,107 --> 01:30:43,359
This is political!

188
01:30:43,525 --> 01:30:47,655
This kind of material, however fascinating,
is for a specialized market.

189
01:30:47,821 --> 01:30:50,950
This morning, in London, six bombs
went off in the heart of the city.

190
01:30:51,116 --> 01:30:55,537
Apparently coordinated, the bombs
exploded at the height of the rush hour.

191
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:01,543
Why are you all against this?

192
01:31:08,842 --> 01:31:11,136
Why are you so afraid of this?

193
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:13,055
This is real!

194
01:31:14,390 --> 01:31:16,225
This is scientific evidence...

195
01:31:16,392 --> 01:31:19,395
...from well-known researchers
forced to work in secret.

196
01:31:20,479 --> 01:31:24,566
A Nobel Prize winner, hounded
by the religious lobby. That's a story!

197
01:31:25,693 --> 01:31:28,862
Better than a philandering,
dishonest old politician.

198
01:31:29,029 --> 01:31:32,825
But a book like that would probably
have to be written in English...

199
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:34,743
...for the American market.

200
01:31:35,869 --> 01:31:37,663
It happened to me, Michel.

201
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:41,417
I saw it with my own eyes.

202
01:31:42,751 --> 01:31:44,253
Where we're going.

203
01:31:46,213 --> 01:31:47,923
What we'll experience.

204
01:31:49,591 --> 01:31:51,719
Each and every one of us.

205
01:31:53,929 --> 01:31:55,597
That doesn't interest you?

206
01:31:59,852 --> 01:32:03,355
Now listen, we commissioned a book
about Francois Mitterrand.

207
01:32:03,897 --> 01:32:06,442
Either we agree on this
and you start writing it...

208
01:32:06,608 --> 01:32:09,403
...or else I want my money back.
That's all I can say.

209
01:32:33,218 --> 01:32:34,845
It was so humiliating.

210
01:32:36,472 --> 01:32:39,141
They looked at me as if I'd lost my mind.

211
01:32:39,308 --> 01:32:42,102
Six months ago they begged me
to write about anything.

212
01:32:42,978 --> 01:32:45,397
Anything by the great Marie Lelay.

213
01:32:47,149 --> 01:32:50,819
You'd better give me my job back.
I've had enough with being humiliated.

214
01:32:54,490 --> 01:32:56,492
Today, they even took down my posters.

215
01:32:59,995 --> 01:33:01,330
Why didn't you tell me?

216
01:33:03,624 --> 01:33:04,875
And your book?

217
01:33:06,877 --> 01:33:10,506
I'll finish it in my spare time.
It's caused me enough trouble as it is.

218
01:33:13,842 --> 01:33:15,010
What's the matter?

219
01:33:16,178 --> 01:33:17,387
Look...

220
01:33:18,013 --> 01:33:20,307
...getting your job back...

221
01:33:20,474 --> 01:33:22,684
...might not be as easy as you think.

222
01:33:23,602 --> 01:33:24,686
Why?

223
01:33:25,354 --> 01:33:27,648
It was a temporary break.
And on your advice.

224
01:33:28,398 --> 01:33:29,525
I know, but--

225
01:33:30,526 --> 01:33:32,194
What we couldn't have foreseen is...

226
01:33:32,361 --> 01:33:35,364
...you'd be talking in public
about these experiences.

227
01:33:35,531 --> 01:33:39,785
-That you'd lose your credibility.
-But I didn't want to write this book!

228
01:33:39,952 --> 01:33:41,537
It was your idea!

229
01:33:41,703 --> 01:33:44,164
It was my idea you should write
about Mitterrand.

230
01:33:45,207 --> 01:33:47,042
So, what are you saying?

231
01:33:48,335 --> 01:33:50,879
I'm saying take some more time.

232
01:33:51,046 --> 01:33:54,049
Finish the book, get it out
of your system, then come back.

233
01:33:55,050 --> 01:33:57,386
It's that girl, isn't it?
My replacement?

234
01:33:59,054 --> 01:34:01,014
I've watched her a few times.
She's good.

235
01:34:01,473 --> 01:34:04,017
Yes, she is.
But not as good as you.

236
01:34:05,727 --> 01:34:07,229
You're sleeping with her?

237
01:34:08,689 --> 01:34:10,440
How can you say such a thing?

238
01:34:13,235 --> 01:34:15,737
You always told me to ask
the tough questions.

239
01:34:33,255 --> 01:34:34,590
It's funny...

240
01:34:36,258 --> 01:34:37,885
Who'd have thought it?

241
01:34:40,345 --> 01:34:42,222
A few months ago I was famous.

242
01:34:43,098 --> 01:34:44,600
Rich.

243
01:34:46,101 --> 01:34:47,603
A success story.

244
01:34:49,938 --> 01:34:51,398
I was happy.

245
01:34:53,025 --> 01:34:55,194
Fulfilled by my work.

246
01:34:56,737 --> 01:34:58,197
By you.

247
01:35:13,253 --> 01:35:16,757
All this happened because
you didn't buy your kids their gifts.

248
01:35:16,924 --> 01:35:18,342
Because of what?

249
01:35:18,508 --> 01:35:21,136
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

250
01:35:22,804 --> 01:35:24,431
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

251
01:35:49,748 --> 01:35:50,791
It's Michel.

252
01:35:52,459 --> 01:35:53,627
Listen...

253
01:35:55,128 --> 01:35:57,839
I feel terrible about our meeting
earlier today.

254
01:35:59,508 --> 01:36:02,177
This book is obviously
very important to you.

255
01:36:03,845 --> 01:36:07,349
I think everyone was a bit on edge
because of the events in London.

256
01:36:09,601 --> 01:36:14,439
But I made a few calls. There are
two publishers who might be interested.

257
01:36:15,107 --> 01:36:17,067
One American, one English.

258
01:36:18,110 --> 01:36:19,278
Do you have a pen?

259
01:36:27,077 --> 01:36:28,537
I'm listening.
