00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:10,338
Ten tiny typists
tripped through the tunnel.

2
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,240
Ten tiny typists
tripped through the tunnel.

3
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:13,740
Ten tiny typists...

4
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,309
You can't be in here.
Compliments of the house.

5
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,577
Enjoy it. It's delicious.
Sir. Sir.

6
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:19,446
Tell him callbacks
are next week

7
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,948
and he'll know
when he knows.

8
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:22,382
Okay.

9
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,922
<i>Okay,</i> Show Us What You Got.

10
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:31,424
<i>Contestant 318,</i>
<i>you are up next.</i>

11
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:32,525
He wasn't next.

12
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,995
Hello, where's your number?

13
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:36,998
- I have no time to waste.
- Magical magic.

14
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:38,732
Wait a minute, man.

15
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:40,868
No, no, no.

16
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:43,536
Hector, we told you
after last time, no more.

17
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,873
That was just
my song-and-dance routine.

18
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:48,376
My new act
will blow your minds.

19
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:52,479
Prepare yourself for
the Dance of a Thousand Pigeons.

20
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,149
Yes.

21
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,418
Th-that's enough.

22
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:59,452
Thank you.

23
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,056
Maybe...

24
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,723
Maybe go back to singing.

25
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:05,126
Oh.

26
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:06,526
Security.

27
00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:12,732
Seriously, dude?

28
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,402
Ditch the birds.

29
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,804
Show them something
they've never seen before.

30
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:19,907
Because whatever that was,
ain't working.

31
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:08,122
Hi, I'm looking
for something...

32
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:10,091
Something...

33
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:11,658
Something unusual.

34
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:12,960
But cute.

35
00:03:13,094 --> 00:03:15,129
Really, really cute.

36
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:17,264
Also affordable.

37
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:20,968
That I can fit under my hat,

38
00:03:21,102 --> 00:03:22,903
while I am dancing.

39
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,739
We got a special

43

44
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,888

163
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:44,631
- You got it?
- Yeah, I'm good.

164
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:45,900
Couple more.

165
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:47,768
Straight to the living room,
brother.

166
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:51,438
Are we actually gonna be
living here?

167
00:12:52,907 --> 00:12:54,241
I think we are.

168
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,143
This is a really bad idea.

169
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,378
Do you realize
Manhattan crime statistics

170
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:00,213
have seen
a year-on-year increase

171
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:01,782
of over 18 percent?

172
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,918
Most people move out
of the city when they have kids,

173
00:13:04,052 --> 00:13:05,118
not into it.

174
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,588
Ready? Ahem.

175
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,060
And you must be the Primms.

176
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:13,460
I am so pleased to meet you.

177
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:15,796
I'm Carol
from Liberty Day School.

178
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,564
We're so excited
to be here.

179
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:19,466
Your new Math Department chair.

180
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,101
We are very pleased
to have you.

181
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:24,404
Oh, if you can just sign these
when you get the chance.

182
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:26,773
Oh, and this is our son Josh.

183
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:29,209
Plus,
we haven't even talked

184
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:30,777
about the widespread use
of lead paint.

185
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:33,213
- New city. Little nervous.
- Sure.

186
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:36,818
Oh, can I tell you how much
of a fan I am of your cookbooks?

187
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:39,453
Right?
I can't wait to see
what you do next.

188
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:42,824
You know, I'm actually scaling
it back a bit work-wise,

189
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:45,125
so I could spend more time
with Josh.

190
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:49,097
And this is Mr. Grumps,
your downstairs neighbor.

191
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:50,163
Hey, how's it going?

192
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,265
The local housing administration

193
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,534
has established
strict noise abatement rules.

194
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:58,438
Make sure you read them.
Yeah, of course.

195
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:00,008
We certainly will,
won't we, darling?

196
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,475
Of course.

197
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,978
That is the most beautiful cat
I've ever seen.

198
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:06,780
Loretta is not a cat.

199
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,181
She's a Silver Shaded Persian

200
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:10,051
with an extremely delicate
constitution.

201
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,552
Do not feed her
or let her out of the building.

202
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,989
Why don't we go upstairs?
Yeah, come on.

203
00:14:15,123 --> 00:14:16,323
I'll be watching them.

204
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,458
My lawyers
will be watching them too.

205
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:20,594
One foot out of place,
and they'll be out,

206
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,796
and you'll be forced to sell.
Okay?

207
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,765
I'd say his bark's worse
than his bite,

208
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,367
but to be honest, his bite's
pretty unpleasant too.

209
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:29,536
Amazing cat, though.
Can we have a pet?

210
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,873
Josh, allergies.

211
00:14:32,006 --> 00:14:33,607
I know.

212
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:37,210
FYI, there's a few leftovers

213
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:39,446
from a previous owner
in the attic.

214
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,615
Hopefully, they won't
get in your way.

215
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:42,783
Welcome home.

216
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:48,422
Babe, can I put this here?

217
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,423
You hate it.

218
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:50,490
No.

219
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:53,660
New York City.

220
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:57,264
Did we just move here?
I think we did.

221
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,735
You think Josh
is gonna be okay?

222
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:03,104
Are you kidding me?

223
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,006
He's got his own floor
up there.

224
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:07,674
He's probably having
the time of his life.

225
00:15:11,913 --> 00:15:13,181
What was that?

226
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,049
<i>That is an ambulance.</i>

227
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:18,418
What was that?

228
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:19,921
<i>That was a car tire.</i>

229
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:23,991
What was that?

230
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,428
<i>I have no idea what that was.</i>

231
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:38,298
"This is my crocodile.
Please, take good care of him.

232
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:41,635
Cordially yours,
Hector P. Valenti."

233
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:44,972
"Lyle."

234
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:09,030
Tofu kale breakfast bowl.

235
00:17:09,163 --> 00:17:11,665
Swiss chard chickpea scramble.

236
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:14,802
Vegan turmeric latte.
I thought it was in...

237
00:17:14,936 --> 00:17:17,305
Three different recipes
from three different books.

238
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:18,738
It's perfect.

239
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:22,475
Oh, honey, this looks amazing,
and healthy.

240
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,879
But I gotta go.
I can't be late. Where's Josh?

241
00:17:25,012 --> 00:17:26,546
I'm taking Josh, remember?

242
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,216
Right.

243
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:29,217
Grab something.

244
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:30,450
Um...

245
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:32,053
Have you seen my glasses?

246
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:35,156
Thank you.
Hey.

247
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:36,290
Yeah?

248
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:37,524
You got this, okay?

249
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,492
They're lucky to have you.

250
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,829
I'm lucky to have you.

251
00:17:41,963 --> 00:17:43,831
Hey, don't forget to sign up
for wrestling.

252
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:45,365
Okay.

253
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:46,533
We gotta go.

254
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,236
Josh, there's time
for breakfast.

255
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,204
No, it's an 11-minute ride
on the subway

256
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:52,006
from East 86th
to West Farms Square,

257
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:53,506
plus a four-minute walk
at this end

258
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,042
and a seven-minute walk
at the other.

259
00:17:55,176 --> 00:17:56,576
Assuming
everything goes right.

260
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,281
Keep up, Mom.
All the way down to the end.

261
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,549
Then we just cross
this little avenue.

262
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:21,434
<i>This is 86th Street Station.</i>

263
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:26,107
Excuse me.

264
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:28,843
Watch it.
Wrong side, kid.

265
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:30,344
Excuse me.

266
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:31,411
Move, move.

267
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:49,864
<i>Stand clear</i>
<i>of the closing doors, please.</i>

268
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,269
Don't worry, you got this.

269
00:18:55,403 --> 00:18:57,171
"You got this."

270
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,581
Seriously?

271
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:10,251
What are you doing?

272
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:13,154
- Do you not see us filming here?
- Come on, man.

273
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:15,356
Do you mind?
Dude, are you serious?

274
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,291
He's literally filming.

275
00:19:17,425 --> 00:19:18,826
Let's go, guys.

276
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,528
Watch it on Sweep
like everyone else, pumpkin.

277
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:22,964
Whatever.
Weirdo.

278
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,081
Featherweights, you're up.

279
00:19:41,215 --> 00:19:42,950
And wrestle.

280
00:19:43,084 --> 00:19:44,452
Look for the single leg.

281
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:47,687
Come on.

282
00:20:36,437 --> 00:20:40,141
<i>I'm Trudy, and I'm auditioning</i>

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

297
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:57,344
Wait. No, you have
to give her back.

298
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:30,044
Did you see that?

299
00:23:30,177 --> 00:23:31,345
Dude, that was crazy.

300
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,881

Hey!

Hey, kid.

304
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:01,774
You gonna give me
that phone,

305
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:04,578
or am I gonna have to take it
from you?

306
00:24:33,073 --> 00:24:35,943
That was totally awesome.

307
00:24:49,757 --> 00:24:51,625
Wait, you gotta show me
how to get back.

308
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:04,805
Okay, last box.

309
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:08,676
Why did we even bring
all this stuff?

310
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:13,147
Oh, don't eat those.
They're horrible.

311
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,883
What? You love these things.

312
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,484
You used to bake with cherries.

313
00:25:17,618 --> 00:25:19,453
You made us put them
on our wedding cake.

314
00:25:19,586 --> 00:25:20,788
I know I did,

315
00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:22,056
but that was before I found out

316
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:23,457
what's in them.

317
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,326
They're full of
hydrogenated palm oil,

318
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:27,294
and sugar,
and corn syrup.

319
00:25:27,428 --> 00:25:30,864
We wanna set a good example for
Josh. We should throw them out.

320
00:25:38,138 --> 00:25:39,873
Outside in the garbage.

321
00:25:58,827 --> 00:26:00,127
Hey.

322
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,363
Those are my trash cans,
not your trash cans.

323
00:26:02,496 --> 00:26:04,898
Yours are in the back.
Oh, right. I'm so sorry.

324
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:05,899
Sorry is right.

325
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:07,401
Don't come around

326
00:26:07,534 --> 00:26:10,037
scattering suburban mediocrity
all over my trash.

327
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,939
I didn't know.
Someone's been feeding my cat.

328
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:13,173
I wanna know who.

329
00:26:13,307 --> 00:26:14,843
Do you have any idea
how dangerous

330
00:26:14,975 --> 00:26:16,343
irritable bowel syndrome can be

331
00:26:16,477 --> 00:26:17,945
in a cat as valuable
as Loretta?

332
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:20,447
If I catch you, or your wife,
or your horrible son

333
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:22,349
so much as looking at Loretta,

334
00:26:22,483 --> 00:26:24,017
my lawyers will be
all over you.

335
00:26:24,151 --> 00:26:25,586
Do I make myself clear?

336
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:27,121
Now, hold on a minute.

337
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:28,522
Yes or no?
Yes.

338
00:26:28,655 --> 00:26:30,391
Yes, yes, yes.
Great.

339
00:26:30,524 --> 00:26:34,261
Oh, please, use more of the hot
water. Help yourself.

340
00:26:34,395 --> 00:26:37,464
There's plenty to go around.
What? Hot water?

341
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:46,940
Hey, hi.

342
00:26:47,074 --> 00:26:48,041
You awake yet?

343
00:26:48,175 --> 00:26:49,510
I, um--

344
00:26:49,643 --> 00:26:50,544
Here.

345
00:26:51,912 --> 00:26:55,582
This is my Plus Four
Strength card.

346
00:26:55,716 --> 00:26:58,118
It's the most valuable card
in my deck,

347
00:26:58,252 --> 00:26:59,720
and I want you to have it.

348
00:27:04,258 --> 00:27:05,526
Josh, where are you?

349
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:06,960
Okay, uh, I gotta go.

350
00:27:07,094 --> 00:27:08,962
And I'll be back after 3, okay?

351
00:27:11,098 --> 00:27:12,466
An actual pet.

352
00:27:19,773 --> 00:27:21,008
Hey, Josh, let's go.

353
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:22,476
Taking a shortcut.

354
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,945
What?

355
00:27:26,447 --> 00:27:27,347
Josh.

356
00:27:30,451 --> 00:27:31,351
Wait.

357
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:42,196
Josh?

358
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:43,263
This way.

359
00:27:52,573 --> 00:27:53,474
Josh.

360
00:27:54,374 --> 00:27:55,275
Hey.

361
00:28:03,317 --> 00:28:04,451
Josh.

362
00:28:04,585 --> 00:28:05,486
What's up?

363
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,094
Don't worry. I got this. Heh.

Hey, Animal Planet.

381
00:30:32,934 --> 00:30:34,368
What's with all the books?

382
00:30:37,437 --> 00:30:38,639
You won't believe me.

383
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:44,611
I, uh, kind of have a...

384
00:30:45,913 --> 00:30:47,214
pet crocodile.

385
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:50,317
Nobody has a pet crocodile.

386
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,586
Told you.
And absolutely nobody

387
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:54,287
has a pet crocodile
in the city.

388
00:30:54,421 --> 00:30:56,323
My dad had to do free dental
work for the mayor

389
00:30:56,456 --> 00:30:59,159
just to get my pet rattlesnake
allowed in our building.

390
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:01,996
I-I saw you on Sweep.

391
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,197
I mean, like, not...

392
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:05,532
I didn't... It was...

393
00:31:12,572 --> 00:31:14,641
You're kind of a weirdo,
aren't you?

394
00:31:16,243 --> 00:31:17,644
Yeah.

395
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:37,165
I've always approached our life
like one of my recipes.

396
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:41,334
When things get hard, we stick
with the ingredients that work.

397
00:31:41,468 --> 00:31:44,906
But now it's all different,
and I still feel bad.

398
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,007
About what?

399
00:31:47,674 --> 00:31:49,177
Josh growing up.

400
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:50,377
Oh, honey.

401
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,914
I know that I should
feel happy, but...

402
00:31:55,215 --> 00:31:57,684
I wish I just didn't feel
so left out.

403
00:31:57,819 --> 00:31:58,719
Hey.

404
00:32:00,021 --> 00:32:01,722
You're a huge part
of Josh's life,

405
00:32:01,856 --> 00:32:03,223
and an amazing mother.

406
00:32:04,324 --> 00:32:05,893
All right?

407
00:32:06,027 --> 00:32:07,394
Hey.

408
00:32:07,527 --> 00:32:09,262
We were lost
until you found us.

409
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:14,568
Oh.

410
00:32:16,204 --> 00:32:17,704
Whoa. Ha, ha, ha.

411
00:32:43,064 --> 00:32:44,098
What...?

412
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:57,544
Uh...

413
00:33:00,614 --> 00:33:02,415
You want me to...?

414
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:04,718
Okay, okay. See, the thing is

415
00:33:04,852 --> 00:33:07,387
I've never dumpster dived
before, so...

416
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:08,755
Okay.

417
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:09,790
Okay.

418
00:33:11,591 --> 00:33:12,759
Whoa.

419
00:33:12,894 --> 00:33:13,794
What...?

420
00:33:16,264 --> 00:33:17,597
So gross.

421
00:33:27,641 --> 00:33:28,542
Let's see.

422
00:33:29,442 --> 00:33:30,677
You like noodles?

423
00:33:34,248 --> 00:33:35,649
Ugh!

424
00:33:55,136 --> 00:33:56,403
Oh, my God.

425
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:35,042
Oh, no, that's okay.

426
00:34:35,176 --> 00:34:37,777
I have sort of quite
a specific diet,

427
00:34:37,912 --> 00:34:40,714
which is mostly Bagel Bites,
so I'm...

428
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:45,052
See, I'm not sure
if that's gonna taste--

429
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:53,361
Wow, that's actually amazing.

430
00:34:53,493 --> 00:34:54,862
I--

431
00:34:54,996 --> 00:34:57,397
I've never had anything
like that before.

432
00:34:59,499 --> 00:35:01,035
Where are you from?

433
00:35:01,168 --> 00:35:03,004
My mom's family
is from Taiwan.

434
00:35:03,137 --> 00:35:06,073
Well, she's actually
my stepmom.

435
00:35:06,207 --> 00:35:07,774
My mom died when I was 2.

436
00:35:10,077 --> 00:35:11,611
My dad says
I got her nose.

437
00:35:13,314 --> 00:35:16,117
I can do this really, like,
crazy thing with my knuckles

438
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:20,254
where if I, like, go like that,
I can, like, crack them all.

439
00:35:22,123 --> 00:35:23,291
Do you have knuckles?

440
00:35:24,859 --> 00:35:25,860
What is that?

441
00:35:33,566 --> 00:35:35,568
Uh...

442
00:35:35,702 --> 00:35:37,939

Yes, it's an emergency.

483
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,037
The city must do something about
these double-wide strollers.

Mumsykins?

490
00:39:21,728 --> 00:39:22,963
Have a great day.

491
00:39:23,097 --> 00:39:24,365
You too, honey.

492
00:39:24,498 --> 00:39:25,966
Josh, time to wake up.

Come on.

494
00:39:27,968 --> 00:39:28,869
Josh?

495
00:39:35,576 --> 00:39:36,810
All right, Josh, come on.

496
00:39:36,944 --> 00:39:37,845
Let's go.

497
00:39:43,651 --> 00:39:44,818
Mom, no, hold on.

Oh, my God.

499
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,921
He's safe.

00:39:54,694 --> 00:39:55,829

Mom, I swear,

00:40:29,296 --> 00:40:30,497
He's a crocodile.

511
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:32,499
Okay, yes, crocodiles
are dangerous.

512
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:34,902
They bite through bone and have
a taste for human flesh.

513
00:40:35,035 --> 00:40:37,004
But he's not like that.
He wears a scarf.

514
00:40:37,137 --> 00:40:38,706
I have to tell your father.

515
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:41,442
No, he'll have him taken away.
I'll agree with him.

00:40:41,575 --> 00:40:43,244
N-no.

517

<i>- Thanks for calling.</i>
<i>- Leave a message.</i>

518
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:48,282
Lyle is a good crocodile.
He's just lonely, like I was.

519
00:40:48,415 --> 00:40:49,782
And he cares about me.

520
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:51,751
Do you realize
how different things have been

521
00:40:51,885 --> 00:40:53,087
since I met him?

522
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,488
I made a friend.

523
00:40:54,622 --> 00:40:57,391
Mom, I feel like I belong here,
because of Lyle.

524
00:40:57,524 --> 00:40:59,093
Josh.
You won't even see him.

525
00:40:59,226 --> 00:41:00,327
He's nocturnal.

526
00:41:00,461 --> 00:41:01,629
And he can sing.

527
00:41:01,761 --> 00:41:04,498
It's, like, how he talks.

528
00:41:04,632 --> 00:41:07,735
Just don't do anything
until I get home tonight.

529
00:41:07,868 --> 00:41:09,803
That's all I'm asking. Please.

00:41:11,372 --> 00:41:13,440
<i>Hey.</i>
Hey, honey, sorry.

531
00:41:13,574 --> 00:41:14,508
Did you call?

532
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,145
I just...

533
00:41:20,447 --> 00:41:22,383
wanted to wish you
a great day.

All right, I'll see you at home.
I love you.

537
00:41:32,393 --> 00:41:33,894
I can't believe
I just did that.

538
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:41,335
Everyone. Yeah, that's nice.

539
00:41:41,468 --> 00:41:43,170

though, please?

00:48:00,347 --> 00:48:02,150
Which is great.

649
00:48:02,282 --> 00:48:04,651
Mm-hm.
And I wondered if that,

650
00:48:04,785 --> 00:48:09,057
you know,
hasn't been because of me.

651
00:48:09,189 --> 00:48:10,424
I mean, is-is...?

652
00:48:11,893 --> 00:48:14,261
Is there something
I need to know?

653
00:48:14,394 --> 00:48:15,696
Oh, sweet pea.

654
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:16,931
I mean, is there...

655
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:19,666
someone else?

656
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:24,038
Not exactly.

657
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:30,878
It's time to tell your father.

658
00:48:31,012 --> 00:48:32,046
Tell me what?

659
00:48:40,054 --> 00:48:42,422
Go, go, go...
Hey, Dad, wait, it's fine.

660
00:48:42,556 --> 00:48:43,757
It's not what you think.

661
00:48:43,891 --> 00:48:45,492
All right, this way.

662
00:48:45,625 --> 00:48:46,560
Hide in here.

663
00:48:46,693 --> 00:48:47,829
Dad, it's okay.

664
00:48:47,962 --> 00:48:49,097
It is not okay.

665
00:48:49,229 --> 00:48:51,231
There's a crocodile
in the house.

666
00:48:51,364 --> 00:48:54,367
That's what I thought too,
but he's not a normal crocodile.

667
00:48:54,501 --> 00:48:56,536
What are you talking about?

668
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:59,006
Everybody, get out of here!

669
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:21,561
Follow me! Let's go!

670
00:49:25,867 --> 00:49:27,068
Oh...

671
00:49:27,201 --> 00:49:28,735
There's a crocodile...

672
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:31,005
May I wish you good day, sir.

673
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:33,241
Hector P. Valenti,
at your service.

674
00:49:33,373 --> 00:49:35,810
What?
Where should I put my bags?

675
00:49:35,943 --> 00:49:37,644
Uh, I'm not sure I--

676
00:49:37,778 --> 00:49:39,746
Oh, dear. You didn't know
I was coming?

677
00:49:39,881 --> 00:49:41,115
No worries.

678
00:49:41,249 --> 00:49:42,649
While you call
the school authorities,

679
00:49:42,783 --> 00:49:45,385
I'll make myself at home.

680
00:49:47,021 --> 00:49:49,257
But you're... I'm, uh...

681
00:49:49,389 --> 00:49:51,092
Please, please, be my guest.

682
00:49:51,225 --> 00:49:53,593
It's been a very long
and difficult trip.

683
00:49:53,727 --> 00:49:55,562
I'd hate to put my back out
in a moment of--

684
00:49:55,695 --> 00:49:57,430
Oh, my.

685
00:49:57,564 --> 00:49:59,399
Oh, Lyle.

686
00:49:59,533 --> 00:50:02,069
Look at the size of you.

687
00:50:08,009 --> 00:50:08,943
Lyle.

688
00:50:27,295 --> 00:50:28,196
Yes.

689
00:50:51,118 --> 00:50:52,019
Ah.

690
00:50:58,826 --> 00:51:00,560
I missed you too.

691
00:51:02,629 --> 00:51:03,530
Lyle.

692
00:51:05,266 --> 00:51:08,568
Oh, no, no, no. We had no idea.
Nobody told us anything.

693
00:51:09,871 --> 00:51:11,404
Uh-huh.

694
00:51:11,538 --> 00:51:12,439
Yeah.

695
00:51:14,342 --> 00:51:15,609
Okay, yeah.

696
00:51:15,742 --> 00:51:18,578
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much. Bye.

697
00:51:18,712 --> 00:51:20,047
What did they say?

698
00:51:20,181 --> 00:51:22,449
Well, this was his family's
brownstone,

699
00:51:22,582 --> 00:51:26,254
but he somehow lost it in
some kind of a business deal.

700
00:51:26,386 --> 00:51:29,056
He's figuring out
some kind of new show,

701
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:31,292
and there's a clause
that says somehow

702
00:51:31,424 --> 00:51:34,461
he can stay here 15 days
out of the year.

703
00:51:34,594 --> 00:51:36,097
What?

704
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:38,933
Oh! This cannot be happening.

705
00:51:39,834 --> 00:51:41,168
We have a crocodile,

706
00:51:41,302 --> 00:51:43,703
and now David Copperfield,
living in our attic.

707
00:51:44,972 --> 00:51:46,874
This is definitely not okay.

708
00:51:48,142 --> 00:51:50,410
And can you please
stop drawing him?

709
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:53,915
It's weird.

710
00:52:01,488 --> 00:52:03,024
Yes.

711
00:52:03,157 --> 00:52:04,058
Yes.

712
00:52:31,651 --> 00:52:32,585
I hate you.

713
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,991
I hate them so much.

00:53:51,165 --> 00:53:52,532
Go there?
Sure.

737
00:53:52,665 --> 00:53:55,002
There he is.

738
00:53:55,136 --> 00:53:56,037
I'm just gonna...

739
00:53:58,839 --> 00:54:01,409
So, Dad's not coming.

740
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:03,576
Dad needs to let off
a little steam.

741
00:54:04,945 --> 00:54:07,048
He doesn't like Hector,
does he?

742
00:54:07,181 --> 00:54:12,585
Oh, well, Hector is
a very colorful character.

743
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:14,922
I don't know about you,
but I could eat a horse

744
00:54:15,056 --> 00:54:16,290
if you spread butter on it.

745
00:54:16,424 --> 00:54:18,859
You're a Gators fan?
Don't be ridiculous.

746
00:54:18,993 --> 00:54:22,229
Smoke and mirrors, my friend.
Smoke and mirrors.

747
00:54:22,363 --> 00:54:26,200
How else do you think
Lyle can join us?

748
00:54:31,105 --> 00:54:32,239
Shall we?

749
00:54:33,874 --> 00:54:36,811
Are you sure this is safe?
Who wants to be safe?

750
00:54:36,944 --> 00:54:38,711
No, "safe" is
a repellent little word.

751
00:54:38,846 --> 00:54:40,713
Expunge it from your mind.

752
00:54:40,848 --> 00:54:42,582
We are here to live, yes?

753
00:54:42,715 --> 00:54:44,751
And living
is a dangerous business.

754
00:54:44,885 --> 00:54:47,021
You're not worried
that some people might think

755
00:54:47,154 --> 00:54:49,123
he's a real crocodile?

756
00:54:49,256 --> 00:54:51,258
Ah. Nothing could be
of less importance

757
00:54:51,392 --> 00:54:52,860
than what other people think.

758

For once in their dreary lives,

760
00:54:56,097 --> 00:54:58,132
they have something wonderful
to look at.

Lyle.

787
00:56:51,545 --> 00:56:54,582
I was, uh,
just checking the boiler.

788
00:56:54,714 --> 00:56:57,818
Because it's cold, right?

789
00:56:59,987 --> 00:57:02,189
Ow! Ow.

790
00:57:03,824 --> 00:57:05,826
Where'd you get that at?

791
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,696
Lyle, why would you do that?

792
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:44,231
Oh, no.

793
00:57:44,365 --> 00:57:45,266
Not today.

Let's try that again.

806
00:58:58,305 --> 00:59:01,108
Good morning, Mr. Primm.

807
00:59:05,946 --> 00:59:07,514
Dad, you have to come see this.

808
00:59:07,648 --> 00:59:08,782
Is that a white rabbit?

809
00:59:08,916 --> 00:59:10,451
We can start the show of magic.

810
00:59:10,584 --> 00:59:12,720
- Can you please pass me those?
- Oh. This?

811
00:59:12,853 --> 00:59:14,655
Thank you. Yes, I need those.

812
00:59:14,788 --> 00:59:16,490
Thank you very much.

813
00:59:16,623 --> 00:59:18,525
Now, now that we have
the bunny,

814
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:20,294
we can start our magic show.

815
00:59:21,462 --> 00:59:23,063
Front row for you, sir.
Oh.

816
00:59:24,498 --> 00:59:27,668
Behold,
the power of illusion.

817
00:59:27,801 --> 00:59:30,104
Okay? Nothing here,
nothing over there.

818
00:59:30,237 --> 00:59:32,841
Follow the card carefully.

819
00:59:37,044 --> 00:59:38,412
Magical magic.

820
00:59:48,021 --> 00:59:49,556
So where are they?
Here they are.

821
00:59:51,992 --> 00:59:53,694
You have a nine,
and you have a two.

822
01:00:02,336 --> 01:00:04,538
Thank you. Thank you very much.

823
01:00:04,671 --> 01:00:05,939
Whoo!

824
01:00:06,073 --> 01:00:08,175
Hey, play us one of your songs.

825
01:00:08,308 --> 01:00:09,610
Yeah, play something.

826
01:00:09,743 --> 01:00:11,745
That would be amazing. Please?

827
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:18,218
Hm.

828
01:00:21,488 --> 01:00:22,623

Lyle?

01:01:20,781 --> 01:01:23,317

and you performed.

846
01:01:26,888 --> 01:01:29,089

Let's go. Let's go.

868
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:39,693
Where are you going?
Why is he all dressed up?

869
01:02:39,827 --> 01:02:42,095
Well, when the world
sees Lyle sing and dance,

870
01:02:42,229 --> 01:02:43,397
we're gonna be rich.

871
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:44,565
Rich.
What?

872
01:02:44,698 --> 01:02:45,900
But he doesn't need money.

873
01:02:46,034 --> 01:02:48,602
He needs a family and a home.

874
01:02:48,735 --> 01:02:51,104
This is the business of show,
Josh.

875
01:02:51,238 --> 01:02:53,640
Because Lyle is not
just a crocodile.

876
01:02:53,774 --> 01:02:55,475
He's a showman.

877
01:02:55,609 --> 01:02:57,110
Bye.

878
01:02:57,244 --> 01:02:58,779
Does he even want that?

879
01:02:58,913 --> 01:03:00,714
Josh, tonight is our big night.

880
01:03:00,848 --> 01:03:02,449
The night for what?

881
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:06,253
The preview for potential
investors in our new show.

882
01:03:06,386 --> 01:03:09,189
Evangelyne will get us there
just in time.

883
01:03:09,323 --> 01:03:10,757
Who's Evangelyne?

884
01:03:13,694 --> 01:03:14,695
Hector?

885
01:03:20,267 --> 01:03:22,369
Ah. Wish us luck.

886
01:03:25,073 --> 01:03:27,641
Take a look at us now.

887
01:03:52,165 --> 01:03:54,869
Hey, how'd it go?

888
01:03:55,003 --> 01:03:58,472
Oh, the stage can be
a cruel mistress.

889
01:03:58,605 --> 01:04:01,775
I thought Lyle had changed,
but he hasn't.

890
01:04:01,909 --> 01:04:02,810
He froze.

891
01:04:04,078 --> 01:04:04,979
Stage fright.

892
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,850
He still won't sing
for an audience.

893
01:04:34,307 --> 01:04:35,877
Just so you know,

894
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:39,413
I don't care
if you sing or not.

895
01:04:39,546 --> 01:04:41,548
Either way,
I think you're awesome.

896
01:04:57,065 --> 01:05:00,001
Just give him a little time,
okay?

897
01:05:00,134 --> 01:05:01,169
He's gonna be okay.

01:05:30,865 --> 01:05:31,866
my old friend.

904
01:05:33,134 --> 01:05:37,205
One or two loans
will now require

905
01:05:37,337 --> 01:05:40,208
a radical renegotiation,
you know?

906
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:45,312

Oh, good,

Okay, great.

Oh, please, sit.

920
01:06:56,017 --> 01:06:57,118
Come in.

921
01:06:59,287 --> 01:07:03,157
I don't wanna be unneighborly.
Really, I don't.

922
01:07:03,291 --> 01:07:07,394
And no one loves music
and singing and dancing

923
01:07:07,527 --> 01:07:09,396
more than me, you know.

924
01:07:09,529 --> 01:07:11,199
Just not at 3:00
in the morning.

925
01:07:11,331 --> 01:07:14,001
So if you could find it
in your hearts

926
01:07:14,135 --> 01:07:15,769
to sign the petition,

927
01:07:15,903 --> 01:07:17,504
and override the school's power

928
01:07:17,637 --> 01:07:19,472
to allow awful families
like this...

929
01:07:19,606 --> 01:07:20,875
Okay, now hold on
just a second--

930
01:07:21,008 --> 01:07:22,609
No.

931
01:07:22,742 --> 01:07:24,477
- Well...
- That's just Josh.

932
01:07:24,611 --> 01:07:26,113
Practicing wrestling.
Trampoline.

933
01:07:26,247 --> 01:07:27,647
On a trampoline.

934
01:07:27,781 --> 01:07:29,516
He wrestles on a trampoline
we'll get rid of.

935
01:07:29,649 --> 01:07:32,619
Sure, but if it's not that,
and it's something else,

936
01:07:32,752 --> 01:07:34,989
something that you're hiding
from us,

937
01:07:35,122 --> 01:07:37,825
something that you think
you'll get in trouble for,

938
01:07:37,959 --> 01:07:40,460
well, I believe
now is the time to share it.

939
01:07:42,762 --> 01:07:44,631
Do you mind if I join you?

940
01:07:44,764 --> 01:07:46,499
Valenti.
Alistair Grumps.

941
01:07:46,633 --> 01:07:48,535
Alistair Grumps.

942
01:07:48,668 --> 01:07:50,037
How in the world are you?

943
01:07:54,741 --> 01:07:56,177
Wait, is that the same sofa?

944
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:58,279
You literally have not changed
a thing.

945
01:07:59,814 --> 01:08:03,050
You see, Alistair and I
grew up together.

946
01:08:03,184 --> 01:08:05,752
Have you been drinking?
Yes, I have.

947
01:08:05,887 --> 01:08:07,754
I always feel like
the world looks better

948
01:08:07,889 --> 01:08:09,023
with a glass of champagne.

949
01:08:09,156 --> 01:08:10,724
A glass of champagne.

950
01:08:10,858 --> 01:08:12,492
Get out.
This is none of your business.

951
01:08:12,626 --> 01:08:15,428
It is, it is, because if
the Primms are the problem,

952
01:08:15,562 --> 01:08:17,564
then I, as their houseguest,

953
01:08:17,697 --> 01:08:19,934
I'm part of the problem too,
am I not?

954
01:08:20,067 --> 01:08:21,869
- A very large part.
- With your permission,

955
01:08:22,003 --> 01:08:24,437
I'd like to be part
of the solution as well.

956
01:08:24,571 --> 01:08:25,907
Would you mind, please?

957
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,008
Thank you.

958
01:08:28,675 --> 01:08:31,279
Delicious.
Per usual, Hector,
you're overstepping.

959
01:08:31,411 --> 01:08:34,115
We are not the only ones
who overstepped the mark.

960
01:08:34,248 --> 01:08:37,285
We, for instance,
haven't mounted security cameras

961
01:08:37,417 --> 01:08:39,186
throughout the neighborhood,

962
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:41,856
filming other residents
without their consent.

963
01:08:49,729 --> 01:08:50,797
No permission asked?

964
01:08:50,932 --> 01:08:51,933
None.

965
01:08:52,066 --> 01:08:54,001
No.
No. Were releases signed?

966
01:08:54,135 --> 01:08:55,303
- No.
- No.

967
01:08:55,435 --> 01:08:57,238
Well, if it was me,

968
01:08:57,371 --> 01:08:59,073
I'd go straight to the police.

969
01:08:59,206 --> 01:09:00,908
Mm-hm.

970
01:09:03,377 --> 01:09:04,278
Out, all of you.

971
01:09:04,412 --> 01:09:05,679
Everyone, get out of here.

972
01:09:05,813 --> 01:09:07,114
Uh...

973
01:09:07,248 --> 01:09:08,515
Come on.

974
01:09:08,648 --> 01:09:10,583
This meeting will be reconvened
at a later date.

975
01:09:10,717 --> 01:09:12,987
Thank you so much for coming.

976
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,021
Excuse me.

977
01:09:15,455 --> 01:09:16,357
Not you.

978
01:09:17,825 --> 01:09:19,226
I can assure you, Alistair,

979
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,996
we have absolutely nothing
to talk about.
Heh.

980
01:09:24,564 --> 01:09:26,400
Why don't we see about that?

981
01:09:29,303 --> 01:09:30,972
Hector had this
whole performance.

982
01:09:31,105 --> 01:09:32,273
Even Marjory was miffed.

983
01:09:32,406 --> 01:09:34,408
Mr. Grumps's jaw was...
She was so upset.

984
01:09:34,541 --> 01:09:35,642
Hector.
Hector.

985
01:09:35,775 --> 01:09:38,179
Oh, thank you.

986
01:09:38,312 --> 01:09:40,647
Oh! Thank you so much.
That was incredible.

987
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:43,284
No, no, no.
You have all been extraordinary.

988
01:09:43,417 --> 01:09:45,186
It was the least I could do.

989
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:46,454
Thank you, really.

990
01:09:46,586 --> 01:09:49,991
So I have to make myself
presentable.

991
01:09:50,124 --> 01:09:52,960
I'll be back in two shakes
of a lamb's tail, okay?

992
01:10:10,044 --> 01:10:10,978
Hide him.

993
01:10:12,213 --> 01:10:13,481
Now.

994
01:10:13,613 --> 01:10:14,514
Go.

995
01:10:20,388 --> 01:10:21,355
Stay here.

996
01:10:24,624 --> 01:10:26,626
Hector, Hector.

997
01:10:29,296 --> 01:10:30,998
Where is he?

998
01:10:31,132 --> 01:10:33,501
- I'm gonna look around back.
- Just in case.

999
01:10:33,633 --> 01:10:34,634
Could be a big one.

1000
01:10:36,003 --> 01:10:37,570
Stay back, stay back.

1001
01:10:39,206 --> 01:10:41,175
No, no.
Whoa!
Josh.

1002
01:10:41,308 --> 01:10:42,675
He won't hurt you.

1003
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:44,045
MR. - Hey!

1004
01:10:45,545 --> 01:10:46,679
Lyle.

1005
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:51,252
You have to sing.

1006
01:10:54,388 --> 01:10:55,389
Now.

1007
01:10:56,991 --> 01:10:58,059
No.

1008
01:10:58,192 --> 01:10:59,093
No.

1009
01:11:10,570 --> 01:11:13,908
Watch your step there.
Easy.

1010
01:11:14,041 --> 01:11:14,942
No.

1011
01:11:20,381 --> 01:11:21,315
You're clear.

1012
01:11:33,527 --> 01:11:35,595
Josh.
I'll talk to him.

1013
01:11:35,728 --> 01:11:39,066
I knew it.
I knew you were up to no good.

1014
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:42,069
Hiding a crocodile.
You've broken so many rules.

1015
01:11:42,203 --> 01:11:43,571
Wait till I tell your school.

1016
01:11:43,703 --> 01:11:45,239
They'll throw you
out of the city.

1017
01:11:45,372 --> 01:11:48,409
You'll be gone,
all of you, by Thanksgiving.

1018
01:12:37,324 --> 01:12:38,459
Lyle.

1019
01:12:38,592 --> 01:12:40,461
Hey, hey, buddy.

1020
01:12:40,594 --> 01:12:41,794
Hey, are you okay?

1021
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:44,965
I came as soon as it opened.

1022
01:12:45,099 --> 01:12:46,799
Lyle.
Hey, buddy.

1023
01:12:54,408 --> 01:12:56,177
Hey, no hands through the bars.

1024
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:57,411
Thank you.

1025
01:12:57,545 --> 01:12:58,745
You, get back.

1026
01:13:09,223 --> 01:13:11,525
We have to do something.
He must hate it here.

1027
01:13:11,659 --> 01:13:14,261
Look, Josh,
they understand crocodiles.

1028
01:13:14,395 --> 01:13:16,197
They're gonna look
after him.

1029
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:18,332
Then why aren't they giving him
pork-and-rosemary vol-au-vents,

1030
01:13:18,465 --> 01:13:20,935
or chicken Milanese
with a dash of salsa verde?

1031
01:13:21,068 --> 01:13:22,903
He's a crocodile,
sweetheart.

1032
01:13:23,037 --> 01:13:26,106
He's a very special crocodile,
but he is still a crocodile.

1033
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:29,143
He has to learn to live
with the other crocodiles.

1034
01:13:29,276 --> 01:13:31,345
No, no. We can break him out.
Josh.

1035
01:13:31,478 --> 01:13:33,713
It's not a bank.
It's a zoo. How hard can it be?

1036
01:13:33,847 --> 01:13:35,883
Josh, stop. Okay?

1037
01:13:36,016 --> 01:13:38,352
We'll come visit Lyle every day,
I promise.

1038
01:13:38,485 --> 01:13:40,087
We'll speak to the zoo,
and ask them

1039
01:13:40,221 --> 01:13:42,256
to let us bring Lyle
his favorite treats.

1040
01:13:42,389 --> 01:13:44,058
There's only so much we can do.

1041
01:13:45,459 --> 01:13:47,695
Not all problems
have a solution, Josh.

1042
01:13:49,964 --> 01:13:52,233
No, you don't get
to decide that.

1043
01:13:52,366 --> 01:13:54,868
Not for me. Not anymore.

1044
01:13:55,002 --> 01:13:57,271
My whole life,
I've been scared,

1045
01:13:57,404 --> 01:13:59,440
because you've been scared.

1046
01:13:59,573 --> 01:14:01,774
But I'm not scared anymore.

1047
01:14:01,909 --> 01:14:03,776
Because of Lyle.

1048
01:14:03,911 --> 01:14:06,547
He changed everything for me.

1049
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:07,948
And not just for me.

1050
01:14:08,082 --> 01:14:09,316
For you too. So...

1051
01:14:10,551 --> 01:14:12,486
I'm not gonna leave here.

1052
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:15,155
I'm not just gonna leave here
without...

1053
01:14:15,289 --> 01:14:17,790
Leave here without...
Josh?

1054
01:14:17,925 --> 01:14:20,728
Wait, Josh, Josh, Josh.
Oh, my God.

1055
01:14:20,861 --> 01:14:22,762
Josh, are you okay?

1056
01:14:22,896 --> 01:14:25,399
Josh. Get his inhaler.
It's in his jacket.

1057
01:14:25,532 --> 01:14:26,433
Call 911.

1058
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:34,441
He had a panic attack
that triggered his asthma.

1059
01:14:34,575 --> 01:14:36,310
It's good he had
his inhaler with him.

1060
01:14:36,443 --> 01:14:39,380
He's gonna be fine.
You got nothing to worry about.

1061
01:14:39,513 --> 01:14:40,447
Thank you, sir.

1062
01:14:44,251 --> 01:14:45,586
You okay, bud?
Yeah.

1063
01:14:45,719 --> 01:14:47,054
You sure?
Yeah.

1114
01:18:35,616 --> 01:18:36,617
Hey.

1115
01:18:39,152 --> 01:18:40,554
Can you believe it?

1116
01:18:40,687 --> 01:18:42,155
I still can't believe it.

1117
01:18:42,289 --> 01:18:44,625
We're gonna be on
<i>Show Us What You Got.</i>

1118
01:18:44,758 --> 01:18:46,460
That's great.

1119
01:18:46,593 --> 01:18:47,794
You deserve it.

1120
01:18:49,964 --> 01:18:50,865
Listen.

1121
01:18:51,765 --> 01:18:53,500
Don't give up.

1122
01:18:53,634 --> 01:18:56,803
When Malfoy escaped, I thought
I'd never see him again either.

1123
01:18:58,639 --> 01:19:01,910
Malfoy? The pet rattlesnake
my crazy Uncle Ernie gave me?

1124
01:19:02,042 --> 01:19:05,546
He was gone for six weeks.
We all thought he was dead.

1125
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:08,917
Until the neighbors found him in
the back of their toaster oven.

1126
01:19:12,252 --> 01:19:13,955
Miracles do happen, Josh.

1127
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:30,637
There he goes.

1128
01:19:41,715 --> 01:19:44,284
Mom, I'm fine.
I know you're fine.

1129
01:19:44,418 --> 01:19:46,086
I'm gonna make sure
you stay that way.

1130
01:19:46,219 --> 01:19:47,220
Come on.

1131
01:20:03,637 --> 01:20:05,505
Where you going?

1132
01:20:05,639 --> 01:20:07,274
Taking the trash out.
Okay.

1133
01:20:07,407 --> 01:20:08,943
Be careful.
Yeah, be careful.

1134
01:20:31,866 --> 01:20:33,300
How could you do it?

1135
01:20:33,433 --> 01:20:36,436
I've asked myself the same
question over and over, Josh.

1136
01:20:38,138 --> 01:20:40,340
But, you see, I've got nothing.

1137
01:20:41,608 --> 01:20:43,276
No family, no friends.

1138
01:20:43,410 --> 01:20:44,912
Then why do you keep
leaving him?

1139
01:20:45,046 --> 01:20:46,179
When Lyle choked,

1140
01:20:46,313 --> 01:20:50,250
I had to go back
and make it on my own.

1141
01:20:50,384 --> 01:20:52,252
Again. Yes.

1142
01:20:52,386 --> 01:20:55,455
But I couldn't, because
no one's interested in...

1143
01:20:57,224 --> 01:20:58,659
me.

1144
01:20:58,792 --> 01:21:01,029
And I owe a lot of people
a lot of money, Josh.

1145
01:21:01,161 --> 01:21:02,429
A lot of money.

1146
01:21:02,562 --> 01:21:04,464
So when Alistair Grumps
offered me that cash,

1147
01:21:04,598 --> 01:21:06,000
I had to take it.

1148
01:21:06,134 --> 01:21:09,003
Out of need, out of fear,
out of weakness.

1149
01:21:11,139 --> 01:21:13,340
And I've hated myself
for doing it.

1150
01:21:13,473 --> 01:21:15,676
Good, because I hate you too.

1151
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:19,847
But this is not about me,
or about you. It's about Lyle.

1152
01:21:19,981 --> 01:21:23,650
And you know as well as I do,
we can't leave him in that zoo.

1153
01:21:23,784 --> 01:21:25,920
So if you have
the stomach for it,

1154
01:21:26,054 --> 01:21:29,690
if you have the fire
in your belly I know you have,

1155
01:21:29,824 --> 01:21:31,159
you have,

1156
01:21:31,291 --> 01:21:32,726
you, young man,
are going to help me

1157
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:34,728
break that crocodile
out of the zoo.

1158
01:21:34,862 --> 01:21:39,433
Yes, because we have
magic on our side.

1159
01:21:39,566 --> 01:21:40,868
The power of illusion.

1160
01:21:42,036 --> 01:21:43,403
Magical magic.

1161
01:21:45,073 --> 01:21:47,207
There is no magic, Hector.

1162
01:21:52,914 --> 01:21:55,248
I'll be at the East Gate
at 4 a.m.

1163
01:21:55,382 --> 01:21:56,918
Four a.m. Be there.

1164
01:22:48,368 --> 01:22:50,238
<i>PlayStation.</i>

1165
01:22:50,370 --> 01:22:53,640
<i>Join us live tomorrow,</i>
<i>right here in New York City.</i>

1166
01:22:53,774 --> 01:22:55,609

1167

1168
01:23:00,915 --> 01:23:02,749
<i>Oh, no...</i>

1169
01:23:10,958 --> 01:23:12,927
What do we got here?
My dear fellow.

1170
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:15,930
May I have some assistance,
please?

1171
01:23:16,063 --> 01:23:17,397
I thought I had
this trick down,

1172
01:23:17,531 --> 01:23:20,801
but I've got myself
in a bit of a pickle.

1173
01:23:20,935 --> 01:23:21,836
Please.
Uh...

1174
01:23:23,637 --> 01:23:25,039
Okay.
Thank you.

1175
01:23:25,173 --> 01:23:26,706
Some sort of handcuff trick?

1176
01:23:26,841 --> 01:23:29,977
This looks crazy.
Maybe if you move that way...

1177
01:23:30,111 --> 01:23:31,611
Hey.

1178
01:23:31,745 --> 01:23:33,346
Hey, hey.

1179
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,116
Magical magic.

1180
01:23:35,249 --> 01:23:36,383
Let me out of here.

1181
01:23:36,516 --> 01:23:38,052
This won't take long.
I promise.

1182
01:23:38,186 --> 01:23:40,988
No, you can't go in there.
You can't go in there.

1183
01:23:41,122 --> 01:23:42,722
Come back here. Come back here.

1184
01:23:53,167 --> 01:23:54,068
Lyle.

1185
01:23:58,705 --> 01:23:59,807
Lyle.

1186
01:24:03,476 --> 01:24:04,344
Not Lyle.

1187
01:24:04,477 --> 01:24:06,214
Not Lyle.

1188
01:24:10,684 --> 01:24:12,352
Not good.

1189
01:24:12,485 --> 01:24:14,688
This was seriously your plan?

1190
01:24:14,822 --> 01:24:17,225
I knew you'd come.

1191
01:24:17,357 --> 01:24:20,027
Yes. Climb up there,
and catch my rope, please.

1192
01:24:20,161 --> 01:24:21,929
You have to get me out of here.

1193
01:24:22,063 --> 01:24:22,997
Josh?

1194
01:24:24,298 --> 01:24:25,632
Come on. Josh.
Lyle.

1195
01:24:28,135 --> 01:24:29,036
Lyle.

1196
01:24:29,669 --> 01:24:30,570
Lyle.

1197
01:24:32,006 --> 01:24:34,008
Help me. Help me.

1198
01:24:37,544 --> 01:24:38,478
Lyle.

1199
01:24:40,547 --> 01:24:41,514
No, no, no.

1200
01:24:41,648 --> 01:24:43,017
Josh?

1201
01:24:43,150 --> 01:24:45,987
You have to talk to him.
Tell him to help me.

1202
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:49,190
It's not me that has to talk
to him, Hector.

1203
01:24:49,323 --> 01:24:50,324
It's you.

1204
01:24:50,457 --> 01:24:51,691
But...

1205
01:24:55,196 --> 01:24:58,366
I-I realize I may not
have always acted

1206
01:24:58,498 --> 01:25:00,101
in the best way possible,
Lyle.

1207
01:25:00,234 --> 01:25:03,237
But I showed you the world.

1208
01:25:03,371 --> 01:25:05,605
I introduced you
to white truffle oil.

1209
01:25:05,739 --> 01:25:07,174
I taught you the moonwalk.

1210
01:25:08,376 --> 01:25:09,609
Okay, fine, fine.

1211
01:25:09,743 --> 01:25:12,512
I apologize.
My behavior was unforgivable.

1212
01:25:12,646 --> 01:25:15,016
I used you,
and I abandoned you.

1213
01:25:16,716 --> 01:25:18,451
And it's my fault you're here.

1214
01:25:18,585 --> 01:25:20,420
But, please, come back with me.

1215
01:25:20,553 --> 01:25:22,256
Come back to where you belong.

1216
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:24,524
Back to...

1217
01:25:33,134 --> 01:25:34,068
Back to Josh.

1218
01:25:39,106 --> 01:25:40,007
And the Primms.

1219
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:43,743
To your family.

1220
01:25:59,093 --> 01:26:00,928
We gotta get you out of here.

1221
01:26:06,233 --> 01:26:08,436
Tell me the second part
of your plan is better.

1222
01:26:08,568 --> 01:26:09,971
Not better. It's perfect.

1223
01:26:10,104 --> 01:26:12,840
I've got Evangelyne
parked up by the gates.

1224
01:26:12,974 --> 01:26:14,774
We can outrun anyone on her.

1225
01:26:14,909 --> 01:26:16,811
But Lyle can't just keep
running.

1226
01:26:16,944 --> 01:26:20,014
Of course he can. You'd be
amazed what you can outrun.

1227
01:26:20,147 --> 01:26:21,614
Ex-wives.
- Hands up.

1228
01:26:21,748 --> 01:26:23,017
Creditors.

1229
01:26:24,952 --> 01:26:26,187
Park rangers.

1230
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,356
No, no, this is not a life.

1231
01:26:28,488 --> 01:26:31,658
We have to show people
what Lyle can do.

1232
01:26:31,791 --> 01:26:33,660
That they don't have to be
scared of him.

1233
01:26:33,793 --> 01:26:34,996
We gotta show them...

1234
01:26:50,177 --> 01:26:52,380
Go, take Lyle. I've got this.

1235
01:26:54,982 --> 01:26:57,018
Sorry, not this one. Uh...

1236
01:26:59,186 --> 01:27:02,356
Give me a minute.
Give me a minute.

1237
01:27:02,490 --> 01:27:06,961
Prepare to have your flabber
truly gasted.

1238
01:27:18,671 --> 01:27:20,640
No, we have no one to drive it.

1239
01:27:47,034 --> 01:27:48,735
Go, go, go.

1240
01:27:48,869 --> 01:27:51,571
Go. Come on, Josh.
Come on.

1241
01:27:51,704 --> 01:27:53,740
<i>- They're leaving the park.</i>
<i>- Call the police.</i>

1242
01:27:53,874 --> 01:27:54,774
Copy.

1243
01:27:58,179 --> 01:27:59,313
Sorry.

1244
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,254
How much further?

1245
01:28:15,062 --> 01:28:15,963
Lyle.

1246
01:28:18,731 --> 01:28:20,901
All units, we got a crocodile
on a motorcycle,

1247
01:28:21,035 --> 01:28:22,503
entering the Theater District.

1248
01:28:22,635 --> 01:28:24,171
<i>You got a what?</i>

1249
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:16,357
Where's Josh? He's not in his
room. I looked everywhere.

1250
01:29:22,795 --> 01:29:24,697
What's he doing
in Times Square?

1251
01:29:25,933 --> 01:29:27,334
Hey, hey.

1252
01:29:27,468 --> 01:29:28,668
I'm on the steps.

1253
01:29:28,801 --> 01:29:30,838
Yeah, I need your help.
Where is it?

1254
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:34,375
Yeah, I'm at the backstage door.

1255
01:29:43,317 --> 01:29:44,652
What are you doing here?

1256
01:29:47,855 --> 01:29:49,890
Is...? Is...?

1257
01:29:50,024 --> 01:29:53,227
Yes, and we need
to show people what he can do.

1258
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:54,828
We need your help.

1259
01:29:56,063 --> 01:29:56,997
Trudy.

1260
01:29:58,465 --> 01:29:59,366
Follow me.

1261
01:30:03,137 --> 01:30:04,605
Whoa, hey.

1262
01:30:04,737 --> 01:30:08,409
Kaysha from Kingsport, check.
Where's Kaysha from...?

1263
01:30:12,413 --> 01:30:13,547
Security?

1264
01:30:13,681 --> 01:30:15,782
Yet another unbelievable
performance.

1265
01:30:15,916 --> 01:30:17,885
Remember to text your vote
to the long number

1266
01:30:18,018 --> 01:30:19,587
on the bottom of your screens.

1267
01:30:19,719 --> 01:30:22,923
Once again, Tamia and Talullah.

1268
01:30:23,057 --> 01:30:25,626
And if you thought
the talent stopped there,

1269
01:30:25,758 --> 01:30:26,894
oh, boy, are...

1270
01:30:40,407 --> 01:30:42,276
What is happening?
What is going on?

1271
01:30:42,409 --> 01:30:44,445
Wait, is that a real crocodile?

1272
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:51,719
<i>Do you have him?</i>

1273
01:30:51,852 --> 01:30:52,886
Got him, sir. Copy.

1274
01:31:01,862 --> 01:31:03,964
You're just gonna
have to trust me now.

1275
01:31:04,098 --> 01:31:05,866
This is it.

1276
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,601
Lyle, you have to sing.

1277
01:31:10,437 --> 01:31:11,639
It's okay.

1278
01:31:14,575 --> 01:31:16,243

All right.

1321
01:34:51,091 --> 01:34:52,927
The point I'm making,
Your Honor,

1322
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:54,428
is that nothing has changed.

1323
01:34:54,561 --> 01:34:57,197
So the crocodile sang.
So what?

1324
01:34:57,331 --> 01:34:59,533
It wasn't even that good.

1325
01:34:59,666 --> 01:35:03,604
Oh, you're just impressed
because it was a crocodile.

1326
01:35:03,737 --> 01:35:06,273
It was still
broken out of the zoo.

1327
01:35:06,406 --> 01:35:08,342
And according
to every single one

1328
01:35:08,475 --> 01:35:10,945
of the city's
very own regulations,

1329
01:35:11,078 --> 01:35:14,715
it cannot be kept
in a domestic residence.

1330
01:35:16,283 --> 01:35:18,652
Order, order.
It's okay.

1331
01:35:20,787 --> 01:35:22,656
I'm afraid the plaintiff
is right.

1332
01:35:24,625 --> 01:35:26,493
But who wants
to be merely right

1333
01:35:26,627 --> 01:35:29,263
when you can be
fabulously triumphant instead?

1334
01:35:29,396 --> 01:35:30,865
Good morning, Your Honor.
Excuse me.

1335
01:35:30,999 --> 01:35:33,902
I have some documents here
that were stolen from me

1336
01:35:34,034 --> 01:35:36,503
which are of vital importance
to this case.

1337
01:35:36,637 --> 01:35:38,672
What documents?
The original deeds

1338
01:35:38,805 --> 01:35:40,541
to the house
on East 88th Street.

1339
01:35:40,674 --> 01:35:43,043
How'd you get those?
Those were under my bed.

1340
01:35:43,176 --> 01:35:45,880
I was led to them
by a new friend. Meow.

1341
01:35:48,215 --> 01:35:49,283
Why?

1342
01:35:49,416 --> 01:35:51,618
Let me see that.
Of course.

1343
01:35:51,752 --> 01:35:55,122
Those papers date from the time
of my maternal grandmother,

1344
01:35:55,255 --> 01:35:57,457
Evelyn T. Valenti.

1345
01:35:57,591 --> 01:36:00,394
Not just the woman who built
the house on East 88th Street,

1346
01:36:00,527 --> 01:36:04,131
but the woman who was the
founder of the New York Zoo.

1347
01:36:04,264 --> 01:36:05,699
This is nonsense.
What?

1348
01:36:05,833 --> 01:36:08,735
This is a special deed granted
by the City of New York.

1349
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:11,471
In acknowledgment to my
grandmother's contributions

1350
01:36:11,605 --> 01:36:15,776
to the city, and to accommodate
her fascination for the animals.

1351
01:36:15,910 --> 01:36:18,712
"The house on East 88th Street
is hereby granted

1352
01:36:18,846 --> 01:36:23,617
a special waiver to house
any exotic creature as a pet."

1353
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:26,054
Certainly Your Honor

1354
01:36:26,186 --> 01:36:28,755
cannot be stupid enough
to consider this.

1355
01:36:33,061 --> 01:36:34,461
Approved.

1356
01:36:34,595 --> 01:36:35,495
Yes.

1357
01:36:37,464 --> 01:36:40,267
Your Honor,
this is ridiculous.

1358
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,003
I demand a mistrial.

1359
01:36:42,135 --> 01:36:43,303
This is absurd.

1360
01:36:44,538 --> 01:36:45,840
Wait a second. Loretta?

1361
01:36:45,974 --> 01:36:47,774
Hey.
Loretta?

1362
01:36:55,782 --> 01:36:58,118
Keep your filthy hands off
of my Loretta!

1363
01:37:03,457 --> 01:37:04,959
All right, everybody,
let's go.

1364
01:37:05,093 --> 01:37:06,760
Relax, we got time.

1365
01:37:06,894 --> 01:37:08,495
I'm gonna get the sunscreen.

1366
01:37:08,629 --> 01:37:11,632
Wait, wait. What's all of this?
Where...?

1367
01:37:11,765 --> 01:37:13,001
Hector, good morning.

1368
01:37:13,133 --> 01:37:15,003
Where are you going?
Get in the car, guys.

1369
01:37:15,135 --> 01:37:18,505
Hold on. I've already got Lyle
over 200 bookings.

1370
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:20,574
Two hundred bookings
in New York alone.

1371
01:37:20,707 --> 01:37:22,342
Once we roll out
a national tour,

1372
01:37:22,476 --> 01:37:24,012
we're gonna be swimming
in cash.

1373
01:37:24,144 --> 01:37:25,913
We're not going
on a national tour.

1374
01:37:26,047 --> 01:37:28,850
We're going on vacation.
On a what?

1375
01:37:28,983 --> 01:37:31,919
Have you ever even been
on vacation before, Lyle?

1376
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:37,524
I got you a floatie.

1377
01:37:40,761 --> 01:37:41,662
That's cute.

1378
01:37:50,138 --> 01:37:52,205
Okay, okay. Fine, fine.

1379
01:37:52,339 --> 01:37:55,009
We'll do a stadium tour
instead.

1380
01:37:55,143 --> 01:37:56,309
Fewer dates,

1381
01:37:56,443 --> 01:37:58,712
but we'll pack in
just as many people.

1382
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:04,217
Bye.

1383
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,654
Bye.

1384
01:38:10,524 --> 01:38:11,391
Bye.

1385
01:38:11,525 --> 01:38:12,559
Uh...

1386
01:38:12,693 --> 01:38:13,660
Hector?

1387
01:38:13,794 --> 01:38:14,996
Yes?

1388
01:38:16,563 --> 01:38:18,099
Oh.

1389
01:38:18,231 --> 01:38:19,934
I'm sorry, kid, but...

1390
01:38:20,068 --> 01:38:21,201
Mmph.

1391
01:38:21,334 --> 01:38:22,235

01:38:41,155 --> 01:38:42,389
Does he have an agent?

1393
01:38:46,094 --> 01:38:47,195
He does now.

1394
01:38:50,764 --> 01:38:52,399
He's got an attitude.

1395
01:38:55,903 --> 01:38:56,838
Let's go.

1396
01:38:58,338 --> 01:38:59,506
And we're off.

1397
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:08,415

1398
01:39:11,485 --> 01:39:13,087
