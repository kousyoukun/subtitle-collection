很难说
Tough call, Kay.

你呢?

34
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,250
我可砸你的脸吗?

35
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,880
你长得真丑  不是吗?

36

别叫我先生  年轻人

听过第6区吗?

49
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,670
根本没有第6区
There is no Division 6.

50
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,000
这根本在胡说
This is bullshit.

51
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,380
没错
Hell, yeah.

52
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,010
看来你在不该在的地方  从巴士上掉下来
Looks like you fell off the bus in the wrong part of town.

53
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,100
我打赌你一定不是这附近的人
I'll bet you're not from anywhere near here.

54
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,390

你可知你犯了多少条约?

58
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,040
-1条? -是7条
- One? - Try seven.

59
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,750
你把那头给我
You hand me that head.

60
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,960
把你的手和蹼举起来
Put up your arms and flippers.

61
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,850

不是人类  没错  你身上还挂着些内脏
Was not human. I know. You got some entrails on you.

65
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,270
搞什么? 
What the hell?

66
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,020
一切都在控制中
The situation's under control.

67

请留意一下
Give me your attention for a moment.

68
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,610
我乐意将事情对你们说
I'll tell you what happened.

69
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:51,040
这称为记忆清除器  是远方友人送的
This is called a neuralizer. It's a gift from friends from out of town.

70
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,130
红光能隔离...

71
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,420
...脑中电子脉冲  尤其是记忆脉冲

72
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,220
从这开始...
Give me a splay burn on the perimeter...

73
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,640
...将方圆80公尺范围内...
...with holes at 40, 60, and 80 metres...

那样很好
That's good.

76
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,560

80
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,160
是谁? 
Really?

81
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,370
我是你想像中的一个虚构人物
I am just a figment of your imagination.

82
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,710
妈的  真是好骗的品种
Damn, what a gullible breed.

83
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,420
说真的  你们没被炸死真侥悻
I'm serious. You're lucky to be alive after that blast.

84
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:39,510

那些星辰

对
No

在纽约会下黑人雨

109
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,760
纽-约-警-察!

这代表了我会扭送你进警察局!

112
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,180
他来了之后  我亦会拘捕他

113
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,360
你想被打? 
You trying to catch a beat-down?

114
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,920
怎么了? 
What's up?

115
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,930
他在路上了

He's coming because I failed. Now he'll kill me.

117

你今天得罪了不少人  不是吗? 
You pissing everybody off today, huh?

118
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,060
你不明白
You don't understand.

119
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,480
你们的世界就快被毁灭了
Your world's gonna end.

120
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,730
你是什么东西? 
What are you?

121
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,030
当心会掉下去  小心
Watch that ledge. Watch the ledge.

122
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,580
下来  我们能把眼晴医好的  别担心
Come on down. We'll get those eyes fixed, don't worry.

123
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,000
等一下  让我跟你谈谈
Wait a minute. Let me talk to you!

124
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,670
我累得半死才可以为生
I work my butt off to make a living.

125
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,220
我只希望能回到一个整洁的家  有顿丰盛的晚餐...
All I want is to come home to a fat steak on the table...

126
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,720
...但我却得到这些  看起来像毒药
...but instead I get this. It looks like poison.

127
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,230
别拿走! 我正在吃呢! 这是毒药  不是吗? 
Don't take that away! I'm eating that! It is poison, isn't it?

128
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,060
如果  我一点都不会惊讶...
I swear, I wouldn't be surprised if it was...

129
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,360
...你像一只被打太多或打的  
...the way you skulk like a dog been hit too much,

130
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,900
不够的狗一样的闪闪躲躲!
or not enough!

131
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,400
我没办法决定
I can't decide.

132
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,280
你一点用都没有  碧姿
You're useless, Beatrice.

133
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,660
在这唯一可以做点事的东西  就是我的卡车
The only thing that pulls its weight around here is my goddamn truck!

134
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,290
早料到
Figures.

135
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,890
什么鬼玩意儿? 
What the heck is it?

136
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,310
你滚进屋里去! 
Get your big butt back in the house.

137
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,280
请把发射武器放在地上

139
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,620
...除非我死了
...when you pry it from my dead fingers.

140
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,210
我接受你的建议
Your proposal is acceptable.

141
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,290
雅加  到底是怎么回事? 
Edgar, what on earth was that?

142
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,710
糖
Sugar.

143
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,420
我从没见过糖会搞成那样
I've never seen sugar do that.

144
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,760
把糖给我
Give me sugar.

145
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,760
放在水里
In water.

多一点
More.

147
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,110
多一点
More.

148
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,750
你的皮快掉下来了
Your skin is hanging off your bones.

149
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,560
这样好些吗? 
Is that better?

150
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,630
"那罪犯眨了两对眼睑"
"The perpetrator blinked two sets of eyelids."

151
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,590
你指两眼一起眨? 
Blinked with both eyes?

152
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,880
他先眨一对  然后再眨另外一对完全不同的
He blinked one set, then a completely different set.

153
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,640
像高灯和低灯那样
You know, like high beams and low beams.

154
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,600
那是在你说的那个武器...
Was that before or after he drew the weapon that you claim...

155
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,980
...蒸发成百万片...
...evaporated into a million pieces?

156
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,850
之后
After, sir.

157
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,440
为何都没有别的警官  看见这些事件? 
Why is it that no other officers saw either of these events?

158
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,280
部分警察的腰围发胖
Some of them are soggy around the midsection.

159
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,110
这是他们赶不上的原因
They weren't able to keep up.

160
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,370
如果你是半个男人....
If you were half the man I am...

161
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,160
我就是你一半那么胖
I am half the man that you are.

162
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,040
你有什么问题? 
What is your problem?

163
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,410
你缠住我了
You're in my face.

164
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,170
-我想他把他从屋顶上丢下去  -真的? 
- I think he threw him off the roof. - You next.

165
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,420
我要跟你谈谈
I wanna talk to you.

166
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,340
10分钟  祝你好运
Ten minutes, you take your best shot, tough guy.

167
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,920
先运动10分钟  肥仔
Take 10 minutes on a StairMaster, you pudgy bastard!

168
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,680
我相信你  我是验尸官韦娜璐
I believe you. Laurel Weaver. Deputy Medical Examiner.

169
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,020
到验尸房找我  我有证据
Find me at the morgue. I'll show you.

170
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,060
等一下
Wait.

171
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,350
等一下! 
Wait a minute!

172
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,610
你是检验无名尸的韦医生? 
You're Dr. Weaver with the coroner's office working on the John Doe?

173
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,360
-是的  -请看这里  好吗? 
- That's right. - Will you look at this, please?

174
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,040
今晚真精彩  不是吗? 
Some night, huh?

175
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,200
今晚真精彩
Some night.

176
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,370
它们是腮  不是眼睑
They were gills, not eyelids.

177
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,750
腮  他在喘
Gills. He was out of breath.

178
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,710
你是谁? 
Who are you?

179
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,630
他跟你说了什么吗? 
Did he say anything to you?

180
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,840
他说世界末日到了
He said the world was coming to an end.

181
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,300
他有说什么时候吗? 
Did he say when?

182
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,140
再看到那武器你会认出吗? 
Would you recognize his weapon if you saw it again?

183
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,770
当然
Absolutely.

184
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,070
走  我们去兜风
Come on, let's take a ride.

185
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,070
慢着  我有一堆报告要写
Wait a minute. Look, I got tons of paperwork...

186
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,200
都写好了
It's all done.

187
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,320
干得好
Good work.

188
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,490
你真的是徒步去追那衰人? 不简单
You really ran this dude down on foot? That's tough.

189
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,280
非常不简单
That's double tough.

190
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:20,630
你到底是哪个部门的? 
So who exactly are you with?

191
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,420
你到底是哪个部门的? 
So who exactly are you with?

192
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,840
调查局? 国安局? 
FBI? NSA?

193
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:29,640
我们负责监控地球上的外星人
I'm part of a bureau that licenses, monitors and polices aliens on Earth.

194
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,180
随便啦
Yeah, whatever.

195
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,640
到了
We're here.

196
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,310
这就是我们要去的地方? 
This is where we're going?

197
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,480
这是积克的店
This is Jack Jeebs' spot.

198
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:41,020
他卖赃物但是不卖枪
He buys from chain-snatchers. Doesn't sell guns.

199
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,320
是吗? 
Really?

200
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,900
听好
All right, look.

201
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:48,240
我进去问他几个问题  出来时我要你说实话
I'm gonna go in and put my thing down, but when I come out, I want answers.

202
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,160
进去问他几个问题
Okay, go put your thing down.

203
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,670
爱德华警官...
Officer Eduardo!

204
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,750
这怎么会在这? 我以为已经交给当局了
How did these get here? I thought I turned them in.

205
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,340
听说你有比偷来的劳力士  更抢手的
I hear you're into something hotter than stolen Rolexes.

206
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,300
我也贩卖毒品  但我喜欢在这儿做生意的时间
I deal crack, but I still work here. I love the hours.

207
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,680
我指的是枪  耍聪明! 
I'm talking about guns, smart-ass! Weird ones.

208
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,100
你眼见的  我只有这么些货了
Come on! What you see is what I got.

209
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,020
给他看进口货
Show him the imports, Jeebs.

210
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,770
K  你好吗? 
Hey, Kay. How are you?

211
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,070
给他看进口货  我很久没卖进口货了
- Show him the imports. - I got out of that business.

212
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,820
为何骗我? 
Why do you lie to me?

213
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,530
等一下
Hold on a second.

214
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,950
数到3
I'll count to three.

215
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,120
他会开枪的  这个人看起来  不太稳定  知道吗 
He'll do it, Jeebs. That man does not look stable.

216
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,990
那家伙这样时是很疯狂的
You know what? He's crazy when he's like this.

217
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,200
他总是这样子  去按摩一下
He's always crazy. Get a massage.

218
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,330
搭船旅游...
Take a cruise...

219
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,420
丢下枪  手举起来放在头上
- Drop the weapon. - I warned him.

220
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,500
-丢下枪! 
Drop the weapon!

221
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,000
-我们警告他了
- You warned him. - I'll kill you.

222
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,380
粗鲁的讨厌鬼! 
You insensitive jerk!

223
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,550
你可知那样有多痛吗? 
Do you have any idea how much that stings?

224
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,310
拿出货来  否则再补一枪
Show us the merchandise, or you'll lose another head.

225
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:09,990
爱德华先生...
Mr. Edwards...

226
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,410
那把  中间那把
There, the one in the middle.

227
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,170
你把将反射碳化能量围换枪...
You sold a reverberating carbonizer with mutate capacity...

228
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,840
...卖给没执照的塞波人! 
...to an unlicensed cephalopoid! You piece of...

229
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,590
他看起来像是好人
He looked okay to me.

230
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,720
他要暗杀的对象是谁? 
It was for an assassination. The target?

231
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:31,880
不知道
I don't know.

232
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,970
-可恶! -我不知道! 
- Goddamn it! - I don't know!

233
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,760
全部枪都充公
All that's confiscated.

234
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:41,100
你搭下班船离开这儿  不然我会杀了你
Be on the next transport off this rock, or I shoot where it don't grow back.

235
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,230
我会再回来问你劳力士的事
And I'm gonna be back to talk about them Rolexes.

236
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,050
在找问题的症结吗? 
Searching for a handle on the moment?

237
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,260
我帮不了你
I can't help you.

238
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,810
我能做的是...
The only comfort I can offer...

239
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,390
...保证明天你什么都忘了
...is my promise that tomorrow you won't remember a thing.

240
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,560
这种事怎么可能说忘就忘
That's not exactly some shit you forget.

241
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,270
见过这东西吗? 
Ever seen one of these?

242
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,240
她望着她丈夫...
She looks over to her husband...

243
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,570
...把它放在大腿上说:

244
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,990
"甜心  它在吃我的爆壳"
" Honey, this one's eating my popcorn."

245
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,330
明白吗? 
Get it?

246
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,920
它在吃....
This one's eating...

00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,090
你是谁? 
Who are you?

250
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,930
知道我对龙舌兰酒的意见了吧? 你个聪明的年轻人
See what I mean about tequila? You're very bright.

251
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,930
不要喝太多的酒
But you need to lay off the sauce.

252
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,430
明天一早九点见
I'll see you bright and early, 9:00.

253
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,510

Moving right in, are we? Think we own the place?

259
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,300
我有张驱逐通知单
I got an eviction notice for you.

260
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:35,340
你在这里做什么? 
Just what exactly do you think you're doing here?

261
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,630
处理你的害虫问题
Taking care of your pest problem.

虫害? 
Pest?

264
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,510
这儿到处是害虫
You got a hell of an infestation.

我看见它们泛滥成灾了
You know, I've noticed an infestation here.

在我的视线范围内  到处是  浮垢...
Everywhere I look, nothing but undeveloped, unevolved...

267
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,320
...让我深信它们这高等族群...
...barely conscious pond scum...

268
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,190
...为了它们短暂  
...totally convinced of their own superiority...

269
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,530
而无价值的生命...
...as they scurry about their short...

270
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,530
...到处逃窜
...pointless lives.

271

接下来  要经由一些简单测试...
What will follow is a series of simple tests...

285
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:40,710
...去测验体力  注意力及精力
...for motor skills, concentration, stamina.

286
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,880
有人有问题
I see we have a question.

287
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:46,720
抱歉  也许已经问过了...
I'm sorry, maybe you already answered this but...

288
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,390
...我们为何来这里? 
...why are we here?

289
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,640
你说
Son.

290
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,060
中尉泽克  西点军校优等生
Lieutenant Jensen. West Point graduate with honours.

291
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:56,940
我们来是因为你需要  佼佼者中的精英! 
We're here because you want the best of the best of the best, sir!

292
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,360
有什么好笑的? 
What's so funny, Edwards?

293
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,820
你的这个男孩  美国上校
Your boy, Captain America, here.

294
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,990
"佼佼者中的精英"
"The best of the best of the best, sir!"

295
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,160
"而且是优等的"
"With honours."

296
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,620
他兴奋异常...
He's just really excited...

297
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,920
...却不明白所为何来
...and has no clue why we're here.

298
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:18,590
对我而言很好笑
That's just very funny to me.

299
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,670
虽然你们都没笑
Y'all ain't laughing, though.

300
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,430
好了  开始吧
Okay, let's get going.

301
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,310
你们要用这张桌子吗? 
Wanna get down on this?

302
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,920
怎么回事? 
Edwards, what happened?

303
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,800
我迟疑了
Hesitated.

304
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:33,350
我可以知道为什么  要杀小蒂芬妮? 
May I ask why you felt little Tiffany deserved to die?

305
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,970
她最具威胁性
She was the only one that seemed dangerous.

306
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,600
何以见得? 
How'd you figure that?

307
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:40,520
本来想射挂在路灯上的那个...
I was gonna pop this guy hanging from the light...

308
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,350
...但是他只是在运动
...but he's just working out.

309
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:46,320
如果我在运动时  被逮捕会是什么滋味? 
How'd I feel if somebody bust my ass while I'm on the treadmill?

310
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,440
然后我看到这个在嘶叫的怪物...
Then I saw this snarling beast.

311
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,740
...因为看到他手里拿了卫生纸  所以我知道...
I noticed he had a tissue in his hand and realized...

312
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:54,030
...他在打喷嚏
...he's not snarling, he's sneezing.

313
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,620
那不造成威胁
Ain't no threat there.

314
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:56,950
我看到蒂芬妮
Then I saw Tiffany.

315
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,120
我在想  一个8岁白人的女孩  半夜在...
8-year-old white girl, middle of the ghetto...

316
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:03,210
...全是怪物的街上  手上拿着量子学书...
...bunch of monsters at night with quantum physics books?

317
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,290
...她一定有些不好的企图
She about to start some shit.

318
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,050
这种书对她来说太深了
Those books are way too advanced for her.

319
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,670
对我而言  她很可疑
If you ask me, she's up to something.

320
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:13,680
老实说  关于这点  我觉得你不要这么针对我
I'd appreciate it if you eased up about it.

321
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:19,850
还是要我向她道歉? 
Or do I owe her an apology?

322
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,900
至少射得很准  不是吗? 
Good shot, though, right?

323
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,370
他不好管
He has a problem with authority.

324
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,910
我也是
So do I.

325
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,370
但他能徒步追捕塞波人  老大
But this kid ran down a cephalopoid on foot, boss.

326
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,460
那要很强悍才行的
That's gotta be tough enough.

327
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,790
希望你知道自己做什么
Let's hope you know what you're doing.

328
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,390
各位...
Gentlemen, congratulations.

329
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,140
...恭喜  多年的政府训练没有白费
You're everything we expect from years of government training.

330
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:04,980
各位跟我来  最后一项  
If you'll just follow me, we have one more test to administer.

331
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,850
是视力测验
An eye exam.

332
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,080
你去哪里? 
Where are you going?

333
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,410
究竟什么回事? 
What the hell is all this?

334
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,790
在1950年左右  政府成立了经费不足的机构...
In the 1950s, the government started an underfunded agency...

335
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,800
...简单而好笑的目的只是要  
...with the laughable purpose of establishing contact...

336
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,800
与外星人取得联系
...with a race not of this planet.

337
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,170
各位看这仪器末端
Look at the end of this device.

338
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:38,430
除了外星人之外  人类都把这当成笑话...
Everyone thought the agency was a joke, except the aliens...

339
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,760
...但在1961年时  外星人在纽约有首次的接触
...who made contact on March 2, 1961 outside New York.

340
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,720
第一天晚我们有九个人 
There were nine of us the first night.

341
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,060
七名特工  一名天文家...
 Seven agents, one astronomer...

342
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,440
...及一个迷途的男孩
...and a dumb kid who'd gotten lost.

343
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:51,520
噢  你给那个高个子献花
You brought that tall man some flowers.

344
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,320
这边走
This way.

345
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,780
他们是一群银河系的难民
They were a group of intergalactic refugees.

346
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:00,660
想把地球当做无家可归者  的政治庇护所
Wanted Earth as an apolitical zone for creatures without a planet.

347
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,450
你看过《北非谍影》吗? 
You ever see Casablanca?

348
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,370
是一样的  只是没有纳粹党
Same thing, except no Nazis.

349
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,920
我们同意  而且藏匿了他们降落的证据
We agreed and concealed all evidence of their landing.

350
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,000
所以这些是真的飞碟  世界博览会只是个掩饰
So these are real flying saucers and the World's Fair was a cover-up?

351
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,420
还有什么其他理由在皇后区? 
Why hold it in Queens?

352
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,590
每年到达的非人类越来越多而且  隐藏在我们之中生活
More nonhumans arrive every year and live among us in secret.

353
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,550
我不是要改变话题 
Not to change the subject,

354
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,600
你最后一次做脑电图是什么时候?
but when was the last time you got a CAT scan?

355
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:26,520
半年前  是公司规定的  你该做另一个预约
- Six months ago. It's company policy. - Make another appointment.

356
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,980
告诉Z我玩得很高兴...
Tell your boy Zed I had an absolutely wonderful time...

357
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,270
...而且要谢谢你  并请告诉我出口在哪? 
...and thank you for everything, but show me the door.

358
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,610
我要喝咖啡  你要吗? 
All right. I'm getting some coffee. You want some?

359
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,650
不  不要了  谢谢
No, thank you, I'm fine.

360
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,080
你们好吗? 
How you doing?

361
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,500
嗨  K
Hi, Kay.

362
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,210
那是不是没咖啡因的? 是维尼斯肉桂味
- That's not decaf, is it? - Viennese cinnamon.

363
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,550
别告诉我只有粉末的奶精了  我最不喜欢那种了
Don't tell me we only got powdered stuff for cream. I hate it.

364
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,720
好的  好
Well, that's good. Good. Good.

365
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,300
你们相处的愉快吧? 
You guys getting along all right?

366
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,430
工作别太辛苦
Don't work too hard.

367
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,270
你真的不要咖啡? 
Sure you don't want some coffee?

368
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,240
事情是这样的
Here's the deal.

369
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:21,820
地球上约有一千五百名外星人
At any given time, there are around 1500 aliens on the planet.

370
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,030
大部分居住在曼哈顿
Most of them here in Manhattan.

371
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,160
大部分守规矩  只想谋生活
Most of them are decent. Just trying to make a living.

372
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:29,870
-计程车司机? -不是你所想像的那么多
- Cab drivers? - Not as many as you'd think.

373
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:33,500
大多数的人类一点也不知道  也不想知道
Humans, for the most part, don't have a clue. Don't want one.

374
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:38,210
他们很高兴  以为自己掌握一切
They're happy. They think they have a good bead on things.

375
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:41,590
为何要保密呢? 人们很聪明  可以应付的
People are smart. They can handle it.

376
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:42,970
一个人是聪明
A person is smart.

377
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,060
众人是愚蠢  易慌张  和危险的动物
People are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals, and you know it.

378
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:50,560
1500年前  每个都人知道...
1500 years ago, everybody knew the Earth was...

379
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,520
...地球是宇宙的中心
...the centre of the universe.

380
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:56,110
五百年前  每个人都知道地球是平的
500 years ago, everybody knew the Earth was flat.

381
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:00,400
十五分钟前  你知道在地球上只有人类
And 15 minutes ago, you knew that people were alone on this planet.

382
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,530
想想明天...
Imagine what you'll know...

383
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,910
...你会知道什么
...tomorrow.

384
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,540
-有什么坏处? -坏处? 
- What's the catch? - The catch?

385
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,620
坏处就是你会切断  和人类的接触
The catch is, you will sever all human contact.

386
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:16,960
没人知道你存在...
Nobody will ever know you exist anywhere...

387
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,920
...没有
...ever.

388
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,760
我让你考虑到日出
I'll give you to sunrise to think it over.

389
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,230
值得吗? 
Is it worth it?

390
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,850
是值得的...
Yeah, it's worth it.

391
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,980
...若你够坚强
If you're strong enough.

392
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,580
你好吗? 
What's up, pops?

393
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,140
我要加入...
I'm in...

394
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:54,680
...因为这儿有更深层的事  会发生
...because there's some next-level shit going on here.

395
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:58,150
但首先我要你明白某些事情
Before y'all beam me up, there's a few things to understand.

396
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,150
首先  是你选我...你知道我的长处
First off, you chose me, so you recognize the skills.

397
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,030
我不想人叫我为小子  明白吗? 
I don't want nobody calling me "son" or " kid" or "sport." Cool?

398
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,530
随便  油嘴
Cool. Whatever, slick.

399
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,990
但我要告诉你关于你的长处
But I need to tell you something about all your skills.

400
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,200
现在你看到的是...
As of right now, they mean precisely...

401
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,540
现在你看到的是...
As of right now, they mean precisely...

402
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,250
...这些家伙
...dick.

403
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:32,970
此行的目的? 外交任务
- Purpose of trip? - Diplomatic mission.

404
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,140
停留时间? 
Duration of stay?

405
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,680
吃午餐
Lunch.

406
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,770
有水果或蔬菜吗? 
Any fruits or vegetables?

407
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,740
你要远离那家伙
You wanna stay away from that guy.

408
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,370
它脾气很坏
He's grouchy.

409
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:58,750
在旅行了17兆里后又在海关  滞留三小时
Three hours in customs after a 17-trillion-mile trip...

410
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,460
都会让人脾气暴躁
...will make anyone cranky.

411
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,580
我们向政府哪部门报告? 
What government branch do we report to?

412
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:05,420
-没有  他们有太多问题  -谁支付这一切? 
- None. They ask too many questions. - Who pays for this?

413
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:10,090
我们拥有几项仪器的专利
We hold patents on a few gadgets we confiscated from out-of-state visitors.

414
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,510
魔术帖  微波炉  抽脂手术
Velcro, microwave ovens, liposuction.

415
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,600
这装置很有趣
This is a fascinating gadget.

416
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,130
不久就能取代CD 
It'll replace CDs soon.

417
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,680
那样我就又能买《White Album》了
 I'll have to buy the White Album again.

418

That's fun. A universal translator. We're not even supposed to have it.

419
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:25,900
人的思想原始得...
Human thought is so primitive. It's looked upon...

420
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,690
...在别的星河认为是  会传染的疾病
...as an infectious disease in some galaxies.

421
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,780
这会使你引以为荣的
That kind of makes you proud.

422
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,110
这是什么东西?

Look out! Move! Just move when it's coming at you!

428
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:53,760
糟糕! 
Damn!

429
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,100
我会赔偿的!

是大吸引者的玩笑
Practical joke by the Great Attractor.

432

他认为很有趣
He thought it was funny.

433

各位  抱歉了
Sorry, y'all.

434

那是意外  对不起

观察室  我们工作的中心

来介绍一下  双胞胎  波和卜
Meet the twins, Blblup and Bob.

437
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,590
这地图显示地球上  每个外星人的所在
This map shows the location of every alien on Earth.

438
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,840
有些会一直被监视

439

荧幕上的全是外星人
Everyone on those screens is an alien.

440
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:37,430
在公众场合他们很正常  但在私底下....
In public, they're as normal as you are, but in private...

441
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,010
你知道了
You'll get the idea.

442
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,600
老天
Oh, man.

443
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,680
不合理  是吗? 
Doesn't make any sense, right?

444
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:47,560
不  合情合理
Well, no, it makes perfect sense.

445
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:51,400
我三年级时  人人都以为我疯了...
In third grade, everyone said I was crazy, but I knew our teacher...

446
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,860

462
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:47,460
你绝不能突出
You will not stand out in any way.

463
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,750
你整体的形象被塑造成...

464
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,920
...不能留给所遇上的人  任何印象

465
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,670
你是谣言...
You are a rumour, recognizable only as...

466
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,760
...对人家来说只是似曾相似  又不认得
... deja vu and dismissed\njust as quickly.

467
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,350
你不存在  甚至没有出生

你的名字是无名氏

你不再是制度一部分

471
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,650
你在制度之上  之外

472
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,690
超越了它
Beyond it.

473
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:19,030
我们是他们

...今晚在波兰外降落
...touching down in the forest outside Portland tonight.

类似人类的? 你想的美  带着海绵
-Humanoid? - You wish. Bring a sponge.

485
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,650
这是昨晚留下的红色警告

486
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,320
纽约上州有未经批准的降落
We had an unauthorized landing in upstate New York.

487
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:47,580
K  留意此事发展
Keep your ears open on this one.

488
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:51,200
我们不是主持星际派对
We're not hosting an intergalactic kegger down here.

489
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,540
有人逃走了

490
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,840
移民来的外星人越区  是谁?

491
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,130
烈擎
Redgick.

492
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,380
他不能离开曼哈顿...
He's not cleared to leave Manhattan, but he's out of town...

493
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,680
...但他现时离城  被堵在公路上
...stuck on the New Jersey turnpike.

494
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:05,640
你为什么不带小子去? 
Take junior with you.

495
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:08,680
这对他来说是热身的好机会
This is a good one for him to warm up on.

496
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,270
去对付他们
Go get him, tiger.

497
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,900
"我们不是主持星际派对"
"We're not hosting an intergalactic kegger."

498
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,570
他只是...
He just...

499
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,120
全宇宙有无限的科技  而我们却利用这烂车...
Unlimited technology from the whole universe, and we cruise around...

500
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,790

你的人际关系还要加强

00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,210
若你礼貌一点  所得的反应会较好
You'd get a better reaction if you were polite.

504
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,090
请绑好安全带

505
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,930
好  你有受伤吗? 
Good. Did you hurt yourself?

506
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,430
你千万别碰那红色按钮  小子
The red button there, kid. Don't ever touch the red button.

507
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,110
好  老爹  七十二元
All right, pop, that'll be $72 there.

508
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,950
好吧  宝贝  让我付钱给无礼的司机
Okay, sweetie, let me pay the impolite driver.

509
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:42,980
抱歉我迟到了  这星球的司机很差

510
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:45,610
陛下  你很危险

511
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,860
对啊  而且每次都  多收车资

512
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:52,950
有个虫降落了  我们要把你从这星球送走

513
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,410
有个昆虫? 他一定知道我为何会在这

514
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,160
我们想他是知道的

515
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,460
那是我所想要的吗?

516
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,210
不  只是给你孩子的  钻石

517
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,670
有空进食吗?

518

我让他休息了
Gave him a break.

00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,410
为亚基伦帝国  继续统治干杯

523
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,620
为银河系安全干杯

524
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,960
你可以杀我们  但你找不到银河系
You can kill us both, but you will not find the Galaxy.

525
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,090
你说对一件事
You're right about one thing.

526
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,100

You're restricted to Manhattan. Where are you going, Redgie?

530

-当然  让他做吧
He does it all the time. Let him work.

537
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:12,920
哎哟  老天! 所以...
Damn, man!

538
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,430
有东西伸出来了! 
Something's peeking!

539
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,640
你却先往城外去  到底什么事? 
You're headed out of town.

540
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:21,180
-我们去见别人  -是谁? 
- We're meeting someone. - Who?

541
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:24,440
是一艘船  我今天没有看到  有核准离境的资料
- It's a ship. - I saw no departure clearance.

542
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:25,560

You didn't?

543

这是紧急事件
It's an emergency.

你做得很好  好样的! 
You're doing fine!

545
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:34,320
有什么紧急事? 为何突然要离开星球? 
What kind of emergency? What's the rush to get off the planet?

546
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,820
我们只是不喜欢  我们的那一区了
We don't like the neighbourhood anymore.

547
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:38,910
有些是新来的人...
Some of the new arrivals...

548
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,500
新来的? 和昨晚坠毁的有关吗? 
New arrivals? Have anything to do with the crasher last night?

549
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,080
对不起  小姐! 
Excuse me, miss!

550
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,210
噢  天啊!

...squid.

556
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:06,770
他其实是...
You know, it's...

557
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:09,690
...非常的...
...actually kind of...

558
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:17,200
...可爱
...cute.

559
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,250
刚才有什么不正常的地方? 
Anything about that seem unusual?

560
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,460
是什么把他吓成这样...
What would scare Redgick so badly...

561
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:34,170
...要带着新生儿去冒险? 
...that he'd risk a warp jump with a newborn?

562
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:36,550
我们追查资料吧
We'll check the hot sheets.

563
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,390
教宗是个父亲  令人震惊的证据在内
These are " hot sheets"?

564
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,640
这就是资料? 
Best investigative reporting on Earth.

565
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:48,980
地球上最佳的调查报告
Read The New York Times if you want. They get lucky sometimes.

566
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:53,070
想不到你在超市卖的  八卦报导上找线索
Cannot believe you're looking for tips in the supermarket tabloids.

567
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:56,070
不是在找
Not " looking for."

568
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,610
找到了
Found.

569
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,250
皮囊

570
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,250
我丈夫的

571
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,250
外星人偷走了

572
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:14,710
慢着  别急  为什么? 
- Wait a minute, slow down. - Why?

573
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,170
给她点时间让她想歪了  让调查更容易些
Give her time to get the wrong impression. Makes it smoother.

574
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,720
有何贵干? 
Can I help you?

575
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:24,260
我是联邦调查局的文特警  他是毕特警
Yes, ma'am. I'm Agent Manheim, this is Agent Black, FBI.

576
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:26,220
想问有关访客的事
We'd like to talk about your visitor.

577
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:27,890
你们也要拿我开玩笑? 
Gonna make fun of me too?

578
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,910
调查局的人没有可令人察觉的  幽默感 
No, we do not have a sense of humour we're aware of.

579
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:32,230
我们可以进来吗?
May we come in?

580
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:34,860
请进
Sure.

581
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,530
-谢谢  -要柠檬水吗? 
- Thank you. - Lemonade?

582
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,190
噢  好的
Oh, yes, please.

583
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,240
警察局长亲自来这...
The chief of police came to the house...

584
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:47,450
...做了一个全面的调查
...and did an investigation.

585
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:51,080
拿走警方报告  还写下我说的一切...
Took a police report and writ down everything I said...

586
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:53,130
...但不相信我说的  任何一句话
...not believing one thing I said.

587
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,090
而且还有点在取笑我
Sort of poking fun at me.

588
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,420
他们问我  若他被谋杀...
He asked me, " If he was murdered...

589
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:00,090
...怎么能走进屋子? 
...how was he able to walk back in the house?"

590
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:03,180
我得承认这把我问倒了
I gotta admit to you that that one got me stumped.

591
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:06,140
我了解雅加  那人不是雅加
I tell you, I know Edgar, and that wasn't Edgar.

592
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,640
就像有东西在穿雅加的身体
It was like something was wearing Edgar.

593
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,900
像是外衣...
Like a suit...

594
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,940
...一件"雅加"外衣
...an Edgar suit.

595
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:26,240
那人变外星人前已很丑
Dude was that ugly before he was an alien.

596
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,000
对不起
I'm sorry.

597
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:32,410
继续
Go on.

598
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,580
不管怎样...
Anyway...

599
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:36,880
...我醒来他己离去
...I come to and he's gone.

600
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,880
他说了什么吗? 
He say anything?

601
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:42,050
有  他向我要水喝
Yes. He asked me for some water.

602
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:44,510
糖水
Some sugar water.

603
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,970
糖水? 
Sugar water?

604
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:49,220
我记得  因为很怪异...
I remember that right. I thought that that was odd...

605
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,690
...他要糖水而不是...
...that he asked me for sugar water and not lemonade or ice water...

606
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,350
...水或自来水...
...or regular water...

607
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,860
...水或冰水
...tap water.

608
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,610
好  碧姿  没有外星人
All right, Beatrice. There was no alien.

609
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,150
那道闪光不是飞碟
The flash of light was not a U.F.O.

610
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,700
是上升煤气团被金星反射
Gas was trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted the light from Venus.

611
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:09,200
等一下
Wait a minute.

612
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:12,870
你洗掉她记忆再编个新的? 
That thing erases her memory, and you just make up a new one?

613
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,750
这是记忆清除器
A standard-issue neuralizer.

614
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,710
你编那么烂的故事? 
That weak-ass story is the best you came up with?

615
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,590
好  附加说明...
All right. On a more personal note...

616
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,990
...雅加跟他前任女友跑了 
...Edgar ran off with an old girlfriend.

617
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:24,840
你搬去跟妈住一阵就好了
You'll stay with your mama...

618
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:26,470
你觉得这样会更好
...and decide you're better off.

619
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,390
反正他对你那么坏
Yeah, because he never appreciated you anyway.

620
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:32,890
事实上  告诉你
In fact, you know what?

621
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:35,850
是你甩了他  他走了...
You kicked him out. And now that he's gone...

622
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,230
...你可以买漂亮衣服
...you'll go in town, find yourself some nice dresses.

623
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,530
买双鞋  也许去做面部按摩
Get yourself some shoes. Find somewhere you could get a facial.

624
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:48,410
而且...快找人来重新装修  这儿很不济
And hire a decorator to come in here quick because... damn!

625
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:58,330
我何时才能...
When do I get my own flashy...

626
00:48:58,580 --> 00:48:59,960
...有记忆清除器? 
...memory messer-upper?

627
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,210
等你长大之后
When you grow up.

628
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:06,300
拜托不要是绿色
Please. Not green.

629
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,760
该死! 
Oh, damn!

630
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:13,350
你知道哪种  外星人是流绿汁...
Do you know which alien leaves a green spectral trail...

631
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,930
...喝糖水的? 
...and craves sugar water?

632
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:19,770
那是昨晚机智问答的题目  答案是...
That was on Jeopardy last night. Damn, Alex said it was...

633
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,860
Z  虫族入侵
Zed, we have a bug.

634
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:25,320
意思是...  我们不喜欢虫族? 
So... What? We don't like bugs?

635
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:27,740
虫族制造大屠杀
Bugs thrive on carnage, tiger.

636
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,530
它们消耗  骚扰...
They consume, infest, destroy, live off the death of other species.

637
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,830
你童年时被虫咬过? 
You were stung as a child, right?

638
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:39,080
想像一个超大蟑螂  它力大无穷...
Imagine a giant cockroach with unlimited strength...

639
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:42,920
...劣等生物本性  易怒...
...a massive inferiority complex, and a real short temper...

640
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:46,420
...穿雅加的皮横行曼哈顿
...is terrorizing Manhattan Island in a new Edgar suit.

641
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:48,720
听起来有趣吗? 
That sound like fun?

642
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:52,220
该怎么做? 
What's the move?

643
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,850
只要虫族在城里  我们就要去殓房监视
With a bug in town, we'll watch the morgues.

644
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:10,030
3号尸体要放哪里? 
Where do you want contestant number 3?

645
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,740
放在那就行了
Just leave it there.

646
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:13,070
那只猫怎么回事? 
What's with the cat?

647
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,370
这只猫有个麻烦  在这签名
There's a problem with the cat. Sign here.

648
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:19,410
-什么麻烦? -你的麻烦
- What's the problem with the cat? - It's your problem.

649
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,290
我讨厌活人
I hate the living.

650
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,670
开始吧! 
Shall we?

651
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:59,200
噢  我的老天! 
Oh, my God!

652
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:05,290
朋友  你是什么? 
Buddy, what are you?

653
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,930
解剖时尸温约112华氏度...
Subject was approximately 112 degrees at time of autopsy...

654
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:19,350
...表示体温上升了
...indicating a temperature increase.

655
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:23,730
验尸者想由直肠量体温  却找不到直肠
Examiner tried to verify this rectally, but the subject had no rectum.

656
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,400
这情况真...
Which is really...

657
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:26,520
怪
Weird.

658
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,570
我们是卫生署的文医生  与白医生
I'm Dr. Leo Manville, Department of Public Health. This is Dr. White.

659
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:34,660
你们一定没有家庭生活
You must not have a home life.

660
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:38,120
我们最近在监视这殓房  近来有何异常状况? 
We watch the morgues carefully. You have something unusual?

661
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:40,660
有  三重凶杀案
I'd say so. Triple homicide.

662
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:42,790
第一个还算正常  除了被折成两半之外
The first body was normal, except he was broken in half.

663
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,080
第一个还算正常  除了被折成两半之外
The first body was normal, except he was broken in half.

664
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:46,830
当我解剖了另两个尸体....
But when I opened up the other two, well...

665
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,040
我带你去看
Let me show you.

666
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:58,100
他的骨骼架构有异于常人
There's a skeletal structure unlike anything I've seen.

667
00:51:58,350 --> 00:51:59,810
我查看这个
I'll have a look at it.

668
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:02,220
你们去查看另一个尸体
You and Dr. Weaver check the other body.

669
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:03,810
往这边走
This way, doctor.

670
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,400
这个更怪
This one's even stranger.

671
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:09,980
我做腹部解剖  我由胃开始
I did a laparotomy. I started with the stomach.

672
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:13,690
我们可以由食道开始  或看你想从哪里开始
But we can start with the gastroesophageal junction.

673
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:17,740
就照你的方法
Let's start wherever you started at.

674
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,530
没问题
Okey-dokey.

675
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:29,840
-这是你的猫? -现在是了
- Is this your cat? - It is now.

676
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,420
跟着尸体来的  探手进去
It came in with the body. Dive right in.

677
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:34,340
他不会在意的
I'm sure he won't mind.

678
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:39,850
你的眼神很迷人
You have really pretty eyes.

679
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:41,850
谢谢
Thank you.

680
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,600
感觉到了吗? 
Feel that?

681
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:49,860
摸到幽门了? 推过一旁
Where the pyloric junction would be? Push it aside.

682
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,360
有什么不对? 胃  肝  肺....
Notice anything strange? Stomach, liver, lungs...

683
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,650
没有  都很好
Nope, all fine.

684
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,400
器官都不见了
They're all missing.

685
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,030
当然
Of course.

686
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,240
我首先便注意到了
That's obviously the first thing I noticed.

687
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,790
我的意思是说  里面没有...
What I was pointing out is the fact that there are no...

688
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,290
...碎片...
...pieces...

689
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:10,040
...存在
...of them left.

690
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:13,340
你知道  那些器官都....
You know, so they're intact...

691
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,920
是完整的不见了...  ...是肯定的
...wherever they are whole. That we can be sure of.

692
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:18,550
我们见过吗? 
Have we met before?

693
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,470
我有个似曾相识的感觉
I'm having a feeling of dejavu.

694
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:25,310
-我也是  -真的? 
- Yeah, me too. - Really?

695
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,560
想知道我在想什么吗? 但别告诉他
Wanna know what I think? Don't tell him.

696
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:32,150
他太紧张了  我认为那不是尸体
He's under enough stress. I don't think it's a real body.

697
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,730
我认为这是种运输工具  或是类似的
I think it's some kind of transport unit for something else.

698
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,820
问题是  什么? 
The question is, what?

699
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,240
这是不是把你吓坏了? 
Is this freaking you out?

700
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,450
不
No, girl.

701
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:49,000
你知道有时候我想做什么? 
You know what I like to do sometimes when it's late?

702
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:52,330
不知
No

703
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:54,670
白医生
Dr. White.

704
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,760
失陪
Excuse me.

705
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:03,640
怎样? 
What do you think?

706
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:07,390
很有趣  她很喜欢死人...
Interesting. She got a "Queen of the Undead" thing going...

707
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,930
我是指"身体"
Of the body.

708
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:09,980
身材很劲
Great body.

709
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:11,900
我指尸体
The dead body.

710
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,650
你最好去看看
You have to look at that thing.

711
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,400
认得他吗? 
You recognize him?

712
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:20,610
在总部见过他  只是更死像
He looks like the big guy I saw at headquarters, only deader.

713
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,200
是什么杀了他? 
What killed him?

714
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:24,450
虫族? 
A bug?

715
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:26,620
她在叫你
You're up, slugger.

716
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:31,870
看这个
Look at this.

717
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,090
这是什么? 
What the hell is that?

718
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:55,060
必须....
Must...

719

...争夺
...contest.

721
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:05,570
你想说什么? 
What are you saying?

722
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,240
避免....
To prevent...

723
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:08,990
避免...
To prevent...

724
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:10,330
...挣扎? 
...struggle?

725
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:13,790
...避免....
To prevent...

726
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:15,250
战争? 
War?

727
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:16,840
战争
War.

728
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:20,960
银河系...
The Galaxy...

729
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:24,090
...是在...
...is on...

730
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:26,430
...猎户座的...
...Orion's...

731
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:29,760
...带...
...be...

732
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,140
怎么说? 
What is word?

733
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,100
床? 
The bed?

734
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,610
带? 猎户座星带? 
Belt? Orion's belt?

735
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,260
"避免战争  银河系在猎户座星带上"
"To prevent war, the Galaxy is on Orion's belt."

736
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:04,420
什么意思? 
What the hell does that mean?

737
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:09,390
那个叫...
Doctor...

738
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,930
...什么的  过来
...whatever, come here.

739
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:15,180
叫什么的? 你们不是卫生署派来的
Dr. Whatever? You guys aren't really from the Department of Health.

740
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,310
洛辛保! 可恶! 
Rosenberg. Damn!

741
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:21,900
亚基伦人不会喜欢这个  他是皇族的成员之一
The Arquillians won't like this. He was one of the royal family.

742
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:23,400
这是外星人...
This is an alien...

743
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:26,950
...你们是政府官员  来掩饰实情的
...and you're from a government agency keeping it under wraps.

744
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,410
他说避免战争  银河系在猎户座星带上
He said, "To prevent war, the Galaxy is on Orion's belt."

745
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:32,870
这就对了  你要怎么解释纽约? 
How else do you explain New York?

746
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,450
我当时在计程车  这个人
I was in this cab, and this guy was...

747
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:39,460
银河系在猎户座星带上  听起来没道理
"Galaxy on Orion's belt" makes no sense.

748
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:43,630
大头里的小人是这么说  对吗? 
That's what the little dude inside the big dude's head said, right?

749
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,800
可恶! 你洗掉了她的记忆
Damn, man! You did the flashy thing already.

750
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:49,640
不论你们是谁  出示身份证
Whoever you are, you'll have to show me I.D.

751
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:52,930

Of course, young lady. Look at this for me, please.

752
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:55,020
别再闪了  好吗? 
- Would you stop that? - What?

753
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,350
那个会害她得脑癌的
That thing will give her brain cancer.

754
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,850
她没被伤害过
Never hurt her before. Close the doors.

755
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:01,900
特勤组快到了
Special Services will be here.

756
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:05,030
你闪了那可怜的女人几次? 
How many times have you flashy-thinged that woman?

757
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,110
两次
Couple.

758
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:09,610
-你不担心造成长期影响? -有一点
- Don't you worry about long-term damage? - A little.

759
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,780
-你闪过我吗? -没有
- Have you flashy-thinged me? - No.

760
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:14,490
说真的! 有没有闪过我! 
I ain't playing with you! Have you?

761
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:27,170
以后清除记忆的事交给我
I think I should be in charge of the flashy thing.

762
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:28,840
有我在休想
Not while I'm around.

763
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:31,300
你会烧坏别人的脑袋
You'll fricassee someone's brain.

764
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:35,560
有两个死了的外星人而且  验尸官需要新记忆
We got two dead aliens and a medical examiner needs a new memory.

765
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,480
给她个快乐的记忆
Make it a happy memory.

766
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,800
它到底在哪里? 
Where is it?!

767
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,060
喂  Z...
Hey, Zed.

768
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,390
...这里的人都不睡觉? 
Doesn't anybody ever get any sleep around here?

769
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:08,570
孪生子让我们守圣塔伦时间  那一天有37小时
The twins keep us on Centurian time. It's a 37-hour day.

770
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:11,030
过几个月就会习惯
Give it a few months. You'll get used to it.

771
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,900
或者你会精神错乱
Or have a psychotic episode.

772
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,530
这是猎户座
Here's Orion.

773
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:17,740
是北方天空最亮的星群
It's a grouping of the brightest stars in the northern sky.

774
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:20,580
-这是猎户星带  -那个小人就是这么说:
- Here's Orion's belt. - The little guy said:

775
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:24,160
"避免战争  银河系在猎户座星带"
"To prevent war, the Galaxy is on Orion's belt."

776
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:26,670
小子  猎户星带上没银河系
There are no galaxies on Orion's belt.

777
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:30,630
星带就是这3颗星  银河系是很大的
The belt is just these three stars. Galaxies are huge.

778
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:34,970
有几十亿颗星  你听错了
They're made up of billions of stars. You heard wrong.

779
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,300
随你说  我知道我听到什么
Look, whatever, I know what I heard.

780
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:16,760
很漂亮
Pretty lady.

781
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:27,810
糟老头的故事渐渐的显现了
That grumpy guy's story's starting to come into focus a little bit here.

782
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:31,730
献花给外星人的人就是你
So you were the guy in that picture with the flowers?

783
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:36,030
我猜她一直没收到花
And, I take it, she never got those flowers.

784
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:39,610
她结婚了吗? 
So, what, she ever get married or anything?

785
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:43,740
有人说  轰轰烈烈的爱
They say it's better to have loved and lost...

786
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:46,080
...胜于没爱过
...than never to have loved at all.

787
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:47,410
你试试
Try it.

Look at this.

789

We've had 12 jumps in the last hour. Redgick was just the first.

791
01:01:00,970 --> 01:01:02,760
他们获悉什么  我们不知道的情报? 
What do they know that we don't?

792
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:04,560
老鼠为何弃船而逃? 
Why does a rat desert a ship?

793
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:08,600
让我看4号卫星显示  质子热感应显像
Give me Lem Sat 4, please, with a proton induction thermoscan.

808
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:12,710
感觉上一捏就碎了
Feel like I'm gonna break it.

809

这是我的卡车! 
Hey, this is my truck!

810
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:03,630
记得领车时跟他们说

812
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,820
谁闯入珠宝店却不偷珠宝?

824
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,920
人类快乐过日子因为...
The only way people get on with their happy lives...

825
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:28,840
...他们并不知情!

826
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,520
别担心那只虫

827

他走不了  船在我们手上

...到麦道格街
... on MacDougal Street.

830
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:54,370
封锁是个好主意了  但外星人还在继续离开
Containment may be a moot point. The exodus continues.

831
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:58,460
就像是舞会结束了  最后走要的付帐
The party's over, and the last one to leave gets stuck with the check.

832
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:01,170
忘恩负义的! 
You sorry little ingrates!

833
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:10,930
那亚基伦战舰呢? 
What about the Arquillians?

834
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:14,600
翻出部分的讯息是:交出银河系
We've translated part of the message: " Deliver the Galaxy."

835
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:18,060
他们要得不多  不是吗? 有更好的
-They don't want much, do they? - Oh, it gets better.

836
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:19,770
他们要我们负责
They hold us responsible.

837
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:25,450
黑超特警交出银河系

838
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:30,740
你把死人放在哪里? 
Where do you keep your dead?

839
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:32,740
我没有死人
I don't have any dead.

840
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,370
在哪里? 
Where?

841
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:35,950
不知道
I don't know.

842
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:38,450
在市殓房吗? 
The city morgue?

843
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:50,880
那些3张1块钱  先生
That's three for a dollar, sir!

844
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:54,430
因为金星的光反射在...
It was some light that refracted off of Venus...

845
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,140
...沼泽气上...
...into some swamp gas...

846
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:57,890
...所以会...
...and that's what made the...

847
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:59,560
好了  小子! 
All right, kid!

848
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:01,770
失陪  怎么了? 
Excuse me. What's up?

849
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:04,690
亚基伦人要银河系  不管那是什么意思
The Arquillians want the Galaxy, whatever that means.

850
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:06,730
需要精通银河系的专家帮忙
We need help, a professional...

851
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:10,150
...一个对星际政治有经验的人
...with years of experience in intergalactic politics.

852
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,070
希望那家伙还没离城
I hope the little twerp hasn't skipped town.

853
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:17,280
大家聚到这里....
If you'll gather over here...

854
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:20,910
聚到这里  再近一点
That's right, move in closer. That's good. Thanks.

855
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:24,620
请大家看这里  谢谢
If you look right here, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.

856
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,430
伪装真差  一看就是外星人
The worst disguise ever. He's definitely an alien.

857
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:43,480
不喜欢? 谁在乎啊! 
You don't like it, you can kiss my furry butt.

858
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:45,020
你忙吗? 
Busy, Frank?

859
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:47,400
抱歉没空  我的太空船要开了
Can't talk now. My flight's leaving in...

860
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:48,690
开始吧! 
Get your paws off!

861
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,110
叫捕狗队来! 
Call the pound!

862
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,440
狗欠我朋友钱
The dog owes my friend money.

863
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:54,280
关于亚基伦和虫族  你知道什么? 
Arquillians and bugs, what do you know?

864
01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:55,780
-不知道  -不知道? 
- Nothing. - Not a thing?

865
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:01,240
停  停! 好! 
Stop, stop, stop it! Okay, okay!

866
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:03,790
洛辛保不只是亚基伦人
Rosenberg wasn't a two-bit Arquillian.

867
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,330
他是银河系的管理人  他以为在地球会安全
He was the guardian of the Galaxy. He thought he'd be safe on Earth.

868
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:08,540
虫族有另外的计划
The bug had other plans.

869
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:12,630
银河系是宇宙次原子能源  的最好来源
The Galaxy is the best source for subatomic energy in the universe.

870
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,630
若虫族取得  亚基伦人就完了
If the bugs get it, kiss the Arquillians goodbye.

871
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:16,930
问星带的事
Ask about the belt.

872
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:19,850
他说银河系在猎户座星带上  是什么意思? 
Rosenberg mentioned Orion's belt. What did he mean?

873
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:21,890
考倒我了
- Beats me. - Beats you?

874
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:23,850
别摇了! 
Not around.

875
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:28,810
他在练习腹语
It's a ventriloquist act.

876
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:30,940
银河系在这里! 
The Galaxy is here!

877
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:32,610
什么意思? 
Here?

878
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:35,400
银河系十亿颗星怎会在这里? 
A galaxy's millions of stars and planets.

879
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:38,160
你们什么时候才了解到  尺寸不是问题? 
When will you learn that size doesn't matter?

880
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:41,660
重要的东西也可以很小
If something's important, it doesn't mean it's not small.

881
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:42,990
多小? 
How small?

882
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,290
像弹珠或珠宝
The size of a marble or a jewel.

883
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:48,460
抱歉  我要在赶太空船之前走一走
Excuse me. I gotta be walked before my flight.

884
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:49,580
快离开这里
Get out of here.

885
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:55,510
银河系在这  不是在猎户座星带上
If the Galaxy's here, it's not on Orion's belt.

886
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:17,820
你想引人注意....
When you want attention...

887
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:20,110
猎户座
Orion.

888
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,080
很好听的名字
That's a pretty name.

889
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:24,160
这是什么? 
What's this?

890
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:20,760
是的  很好  谢谢
Yes, good, thank you.

891
01:09:21,010 --> 01:09:24,100
谢谢你确定铃没坏
Thank you for making sure the bell works.

892
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:28,520
农夫  有什么事? 
What's up, Farmer John?

893
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:32,650
有个人来这里
A man came in here earlier.

894
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:34,060
一个死人
A dead man.

895
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:36,270
与我何干? 
And that means what to me?

896
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:41,200
他是我的好友
It was a very dear friend of mine.

897
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:43,990
有只动物跟他一起
I believe he had an animal with him.

898
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:46,780
是我送他的礼物  一只猫
It was a gift I gave him. A pet cat.

899
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:48,660
对我来说非常的重要
It means worlds to me.

900
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:50,660
我想要回来
I'd like to have it back.

901
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:54,380
我需要身份证...  ...宠物拥有人证明...
I'll need picture I.D., proof of ownership of the cat...

902
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:58,130
...与死人亲属关系  的公证证明
...notarized proof of kinship with the deceased.

903
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:00,510
别这样
Don't do that.

904
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:03,340
哪样? 
Do what?

905
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:06,010
别打
Don't do it.

906
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:09,970
天啊! 
Oh, man.

907
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:17,610
杀虫剂

908
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:27,910
K  交给我就行了
Look, Kay, let me handle this one.

909
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,870
不过是抓猫  不难的
All we gotta do is get a cat. It's not that hard.

910
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:35,420
如果你进去  你又会对她闪个不停
But if you go in there, you'll start flashing your brain ray in her face.

911
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:37,290
会害她得血癌
She'll wind up with leukemia.

912
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:41,380
医生不需要你把她学的都洗掉  我只要五分钟
The doctor don't need you flashing away her med-school classes. Five minutes.

913
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:42,970
两分钟
Two minutes.

914
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:46,510
那只猫呢? 
Where's the animal?

915
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:48,220
我说了  不知道
I said I don't know.

916
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:50,720
我们去找
Well, let's see if we can find it.

917
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:57,270
你好
Hello!

918
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:07,660
嗨! 
Hello!

919
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,620
你好吗? 
- How you doing? - Hello.

920
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:16,790
我是弗莱迪警官  26支局来的
I'm Sergeant Friday from the 26th Precinct.

921
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,630
有只猫跟尸体一起被送来
A cat came in with a corpse the other day.

922
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:21,960
-名牌上是写着猎户座  -是的
- "Orion" on the nametag? - Right.

923
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,760
这只猫...
Well, this cat is a witness...

924
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:28,470
...是谋杀案...的证人  我要带它走
...in a murder case. I'll need to take him.

925
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,300
我不知道猫在哪里
I don't know where the cat is.

926
01:11:30,550 --> 01:11:31,850
不知道? 
You don't?

927
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:35,100
但你可以带我跟你走
No, but maybe you could take me with you instead.

928
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:40,110
你还真主动
Damn, you do start fast, don't you?

929
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:42,110
我真的想跟你走
I'd really like to go with you...

930
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:43,440
...就是现在! 
...now.

931
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,780
为什么? 
And exactly why is that?

932
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,080
我有东西要给你看
I need to show you something.

933
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:57,620
慢点
Slow down.

934
01:11:57,870 --> 01:12:01,130
你不可以这么快! 
- Girl, don't hit the gas like that! - You don't understand.

935
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:03,630
你一定要看这个
You really need to see this.

936
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:05,640
我会  只有一件事 
I will. One thing.

937
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:08,470
我来驾车  这不是雄纠纠的任务
I gotta drive. It's not some macho trip.

938
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:11,100
我在说这是我的习惯
That's just the way I get down.

939
01:12:22,230 --> 01:12:24,860
色鬼  你没搞懂
Look, stud, you're really not getting this.

940
01:12:25,070 --> 01:12:28,200
我需要你帮助我
There's something I need you to help me with.

941
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,210
别动! 
Freeze it!

942
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:41,500
你真迟钝! 
You are thick!

943
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:42,880
我怎么会知道? 
How could I know?

944
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:44,340
说得还不够清楚? 
Did I have to sing it?

945
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:46,130
你像在勾引我...
You were like a drunk prom date.

946
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:50,260
真是的! 女人显示出性独立...
Typical. Anytime a woman shows even a hint of sexual independence...

947
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:51,300
闭嘴! 
Shut up!

948
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:52,340
放开她  吃屎的! 
Let her go!

949
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:54,350
听好  猴仔...
Listen, monkey-boy...

950
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,810
...跟你比起来我们进化多了
...l'm on the top rung of the evolutionary ladder.

951
01:12:58,060 --> 01:12:59,140
所以闭嘴
So can it.

952
01:12:59,390 --> 01:13:01,900
让我看你的脸  然后我会把你的病治好
Show me your face, and I'll cure your ills.

953
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:05,570
拔过苍蝇的翅膀吗? 想过苍蝇会报仇吗? 
Ever pull wings off a fly? Care to see the fly get even?

954
01:13:05,770 --> 01:13:07,190
那你的船呢? 
What about your ship?

955
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:10,360
你没太空船  已经被没收了
If that's what you call that trash we got locked up.

956
01:13:10,610 --> 01:13:12,990
-放下武器! -休想
- Put your weapons down! - Won't happen.

957
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,070
没关系
It's okay.

958
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:15,910
怎么会没关系? 
How is it okay?

959
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:18,250
我是说将会没事
I'm saying it's gonna be okay.

960
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,410
别太肯定  混球
Don't bet on it, meat sack.

961
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:31,720
放我走! 
Let me go!

962
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:43,940
进去! 
Go on!

963
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:49,230
带我去这里
Take me here.

964
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:50,320
休想
No way.

965
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:52,610
带我去! 
Take me!

966
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:11,510
他上了计程车
He's in a cab!

967
01:14:33,990 --> 01:14:36,360
别动....
Don't move! Don't move! Don't move!

968
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:38,370
嗨  这位先生  什么? 
Hey, man, what?

969
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:52,460
搭计程车逃不出地球  走! 跟我来! 
He's not leaving the planet in a cab. Let's go.

970
01:14:57,430 --> 01:15:00,100
启动曼哈顿侦测网
Put up a bionet all the way around Manhattan.

971
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:02,640
不是人类就别想离开! 
If it's not human, it doesn't leave.

972
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:05,600
亚基伦战舰怎么说? 
What do we hear from upstairs?

973
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:07,060
一样  交出银河系
" Deliver the Galaxy."

974
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:10,320
虫族拿走银河系  但我们有他的船
The bug's got the Galaxy, but we got his ship.

975
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:15,820
警告! 质子武器威胁
Warning: Plutonic fusion detection.

976
01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:19,280
质子武器开动
Warning: Plutonic fusion detection.

977
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:26,500
为什么开枪打我们? 亚基伦战争规则  
- Why are they shooting at us? - Battle rules.

978
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:29,090
他们下了最后通牒  然后示警弹 
We get an ultimatum, a warning shot,

979
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:31,000
之后要在银河1周时间回覆
 then a galactic week to respond.

980
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:34,130
银河1周是多久? 
A galactic week? How the hell long is that?

981
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:35,470
1小时
One hour.

982
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,010
1小时? 
One hour?

983
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:38,640
然后呢? 
Then what?

984
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:45,180
狗屎! 
That's bullshit!

985
01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:49,350
为了不让虫族得手  亚基伦人会毁了它
To keep the bugs from getting it, Arquillians will destroy that galaxy.

986
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,110
和它所在的星球
And whatever planet it's on.

987
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:54,690
你指的是我们
You're talking about us.

988
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:56,360
很讨厌吧? 
Sucks, huh?

989
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:01,700
搜索1百里以内的太空船
I'll get the location of every interstellar vehicle.

990
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:04,120
搜过了  法兰克搭上最后一艘船
I already did. Frank took the last ship.

991
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:06,540
-史尼登机场与史龙码头  -走了
- Sneden's Landing and Throg's Neck. - Gone.

992
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:08,580
-大西洋城  -走了
- What about Atlantic City? - Gone.

993
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:10,250
-巴瑞欧站? -走了
- Bayonne? - Gone.

994
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:13,040
-还有三里岛  -走了
- There's Three Mile Island. - Gone.

995
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:15,380
-史坦登岛! -走了  谢天谢地
- Staten Island? - Gone, thank God.

996
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:19,680
时间紧迫虫人若离开...
We're running out of time. If that bug gets off Earth, we're bug food.

997
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:21,010
嘿! 老头! 
Hey, old guys!

998
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,980
那还能用吗? 
Do those still work?

999
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,240
-你跟我来  -什么? 
- You're coming with me. - What?

1000
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:48,660
长途飞行  我要点心
It's a long trip. I'll need a snack.

1001
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:55,630
你要走隧道? 
The tunnel?

1002
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,760
还有别条路到皇后区? 隧道会塞车! 
- You know a better way to Queens? - It'll be packed!

1003
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:02,040
皇后区隧道

1004
01:17:12,190 --> 01:17:13,480
记得红色按纽吗? 
Remember the red button?

1005
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:15,770
按红色按纽
Push the red button.

1006
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:17,900
最好绑安全带
Put on a seat belt.

1007
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:33,080
你太紧张了  年轻人放轻松
You're much too tense. You're young. Relax.

1008
01:17:33,330 --> 01:17:35,080
放轻松  享受工作上的乐趣
Take some joy in your work.

1009
01:17:35,330 --> 01:17:36,500
喜欢音乐吗? 
Do you like music?

1010
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:38,880
猫王

1011
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:40,150
哇!

1012
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:41,720
这样好多了
That's better.

1013
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:45,390
...  in  Norfolk  Virginia  California  on  my  mind

1014
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:48,510
I  straddled  that  Greyhound  And  rode  him  into  Raleigh

1015
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:50,520
And  on  across  Caroline

1016
01:17:50,930 --> 01:17:53,890
Somebody  help  me  Get  out  of  Louisiana

1017
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:58,230
There  are  people  there  Who  care  a  little  'bout  me

1018
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:01,820
And  won't  let  the  poor  boy  down

1019
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:14,960
你知道猫王己死了? 
You do know Elvis is dead?

1020
01:18:15,210 --> 01:18:17,750
没有  猫王没死  他回家了
No, Elvis is not dead. He just went home.

1021
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:34,640
你不会想吃我
You don't wanna eat me.

1022
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:37,690
我是地球上的重要人物  我是皇后
I'm an important person on my planet. Like a queen!

1023
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:40,730
是女神  大家膜拜我
A goddess, even. There are those who worship me.

1024
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:42,730
我只是想让你知道  
I'm not trying to impress you.

1025
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:45,030
这样会引起战争
I'm just saying it could start a war!

1026
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,820
战争才好  我家人就有的吃的了
Good, war. That means more food for my family.

1027
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:51,450
全部7千8百万的人  有许多张嘴要吃东西
All 78 million of them. That's a lot of mouths to feed.

1028
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:54,290
你是个好爸爸  但我要留在这! 
You're a wonderful dad, but I'm staying here!

1029
01:19:15,930 --> 01:19:18,060
那就是我的意思
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

1030
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:21,190
蟑螂来了
Roaches check in.

1031
01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:24,480
休想离开
They don't check out.

1032
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:33,330
警告! 地球8分钟后毁灭
Warning: E ight minutes to the destruction of Earth.

1033
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:36,410
8分钟后...
E ight minutes...

1034
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:37,910
...毁灭
... to destruction.

1035
01:20:23,130 --> 01:20:25,960
我们用内爆第五级电波
We'll use pulsar level five with an implosion factor.

1036
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:27,050
什么? ! 
What?!

1037
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:30,470
数到3就射击  1
Just shoot the damn thing on the count of three. One...

1038
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,930
...2...3
...Two ...Three

1039
01:21:32,650 --> 01:21:34,240
白痴! 
You idiots!

1040
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:37,280
你根本就不懂! 
You don't get it!

1041
01:21:37,530 --> 01:21:38,410
我赢了
I've won.

1042
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,640
结束了
It's over.

1043
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:43,410
吃奶的蠢货! 
You're milk-suckers!

1044
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,710
你们不重要
You don't matter.

1045
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,460
几秒钟后你们都不会碍事了
In a few seconds, you won't even be matter.

1046
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:51,420
你因违反星际法被捕了
You're under arrest for violating the Tycho Treaty.

1047
01:21:51,670 --> 01:21:54,430
交出你手上的银河系...
So hand over whatever galaxy you might be carrying...

1048
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:57,390
...然后把手放到头上
...and put your hands on your head.

1049
01:22:02,390 --> 01:22:04,230
我把手...
I'll put my hands...

1050
01:22:06,730 --> 01:22:07,980
...放到头上
...on my head.

1051
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,400
像这样? 
Like this?

1052
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:44,810
这不在我的计划中
That did not go the way I planned.

1053
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,730
不要让它上第二条船
Don't let him on the second ship.

1054
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:49,900
-你说什么? -别让他离开地球! 
- What are you talking about? - Keep him on this planet.

1055
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:52,110
你要去哪里? 
Where are you going?

1056
01:22:52,730 --> 01:22:54,610
去拿回我的枪
I'm gonna get my gun back.

1057
01:22:57,410 --> 01:22:58,240
喂  虫人! 
Hey, bug!

1058
01:22:58,490 --> 01:23:01,410
我跟你说话! 知道我用报纸杀过  
You know how many of your kind I've swatted with a paper?

1059
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:04,160
多少像你一样的虫子? 
You're just a smear on the sports page...

1060
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:07,330
...你这个黏哒哒的  专吃内脏的寄生虫
...you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal parasite!

1061
01:23:07,830 --> 01:23:09,250
吃我! 
Eat me!

1062
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:10,790
吃我! 
Eat me!

1063
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:30,020
怎么了? 
What's up?

1064
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:33,820
吃完就想逃? 不吃甜品了? 
You just gonna eat and run? What about dessert?

1065
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:41,200
就这样? 
That's it?

1066
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:45,080
你要去哪? 现在好戏才刚要上场! 
Where you going? This party's just getting started.

1067
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:47,160
你要去哪? 
Where you going?

1068
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,870
你要去哪? 
Where you going?

1069
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:52,130
听好
Let me tell you.

1070
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:55,840
只有一个方法离开这星球  就是必须经过我这关
There's only one way off this planet, and that's through me.

1071
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:40,840
你去哪里? 
Where you going?

1072
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:43,220
你以为你赢了? 
Why you running, huh?

1073
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,390
我还站着的
I'm still standing.

1074
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:48,060
快  拿来  拿来
Come on, bring it. Bring it!

1075
01:25:07,910 --> 01:25:10,370
抱歉  那是你的姑妈吗? 
I'm sorry. Was that your auntie?

1076
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:14,420
这表示这是你舅舅
That means that's your uncle.

1077
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:18,670
你们长得都一样
You all look alike.

1078
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:28,850
瞧瞧
Well, well.

1079
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:32,600
大坏虫有颗脆弱的心
Big, bad bug got a bit of a soft spot, huh?

1080
01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:38,360
我不明白的是...
I can't understand why you gotta...

1081
01:25:38,610 --> 01:25:41,070
...你为什么要带人来这
...come down here bringing all this ruckus...

1082
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:44,070
制造混乱夺取银河系? 
...snatching up galaxies and everything.

1083
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:48,410
我的态度是不找麻烦  就没麻烦
My attitude is, don't start nothing, won't be nothing.

1084
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:58,340
快从我的面前消失  免得麻烦上身
Ease up out of my face before something bad happens to you.

1085
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:01,510
太迟了
Too late.

1086
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,620
告诉亚基伦人  我们拿到银河系了
Tell the Arquillians we have the Galaxy.

1087
01:26:33,870 --> 01:26:35,660
知道了
You got it, friend.

1088
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:39,460
要把枪拿回来  是吗? 
Going to get your gun back, huh?

1089
01:26:39,710 --> 01:26:41,170
我喜欢这把枪
I like this gun.

1090
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:46,130
你在里面鬼混  害的我一个人在忙
While you was in there playing around, I was doing all the work.

1091
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:49,340
我先用石头打他的头
I had to bean him in the head with this big rock.

1092
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:51,510
本来想用木板打他
I was gonna hit him with a 2-by-4.

1093
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,350
它踢我  好痛
He kicked me. It hurt.

1094
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,350
我拿起火来吓他
But then I got to the fire. I was like that with it.

1095
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,020
工作第二天表现不错
Not bad for your second day of work, is it?

1096
01:26:59,860 --> 01:27:03,190
这是我遇过最怪异的情况
This definitely rates a 9.0 on my weird-shit-o-metre.

1097
01:27:03,610 --> 01:27:07,360
你该看看在1968年  麦格逊人迁移时
Should've been here for the Zeronion migration in 1968.

1098
01:27:09,990 --> 01:27:12,620
你还没出生吧! 
I guess you weren't even alive in '68.

1099
01:27:18,290 --> 01:27:20,920
很有趣的工作
Interesting job you guys have.

1100
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:38,890
我知道有规矩...
I know we got these rules...

1101
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:41,400
...但她协助我们杀了那只虫
...but she did help us bust that bug.

1102
01:27:41,650 --> 01:27:44,320
也许不必清除她的记忆
Maybe we didn't have to flashy-thing her.

1103
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:49,200
她会跟谁说? 她成天跟死人为伍
Come on. Who will she tell? She hang out with dead people.

1104
01:27:49,450 --> 01:27:51,070
不是给她的

01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:32,440
内野手说:

1132
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:32,440
飞碟害我漏接!

1133
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:36,700
一个男人昏迷35年!
