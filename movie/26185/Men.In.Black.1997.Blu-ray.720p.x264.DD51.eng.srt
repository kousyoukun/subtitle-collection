1
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,810
Goddamn bugs.

2
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,530
Oh, shit!

3
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, crap.

4
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,850
Well, Nick the Dick. What a surprise.

5
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,290
Where you coming from, Nick?

6
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,960
Fishing in Cuernavaca.

7
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,520
Sure you are. Let's take a look at your catch.

8
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,960
Come on.

9
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,360
Me? I would've thrown them back.

10
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,650
What do you get? 100 bucks a head? 200?

11
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,380
Hope you saved it all for your lawyer. You are gonna need it.

12
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,320
We'll take it from here.

13
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,990
Who the hell are you?

14
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,620
I.N.S., Division 6.

15
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,190
Division 6? I never heard of Division 6.

16
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,600
Really?

17
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,500
Who you got your money on, Dee?

18
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,660
Tough call, Kay.

19
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,140
- We've got a winner here. - Oh, I know.

20
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,110
Sir...

21
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:24,820
Don't "sir" me, young man. You have no idea who you're dealing with.

22
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,290
We're going to chat with our friend. You can hit the road.

23
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,390
Keep on protecting us from the dangerous aliens.

24
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,730
You ever hear of Division 6?

25
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,900
There is no Division 6.

26
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,040
- This is bullshit. - Hell, yeah.

27
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,780
Looks like you fell off the bus in the wrong part of town, amigo.

28
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,150
I'll bet dollars to pesos you're not from anywhere near here.

29
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,360
Mikey?

30
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,370
When did they let you out of jail?

31
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,800
Political refugee. Right.

32
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,370
You know how many treaties you just violated?

33
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,110
- One! - Try seven.

34
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,750
That's enough, Mikey. You hand me that head.

35
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,980
Put up your arms and all your flippers.

36
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,890
Shit.

37
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,700
Shoot him!

38
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,500
That.

39
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,270
...wa-wa-wa...

40
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,010
Was not human. I know. You got some entrails on you, pal.

41
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,440
What the hell?

42
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,210
The situation's under control. Calm down, please.

43
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,690
Give me your attention for a moment. I'll tell you what happened.

44
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,870
This is called a neuralizer.

45
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,160
It's a gift from some friends from out of town.

46
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,140
This red eye isolates...

47
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,400
the electronic impulses in your brains, specifically memory.

48
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,440
Fellas, give me a splay burn around the perimeter with holes...

49
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,970
at 40, 60 and 80 meters from right here. Thank you.

50
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,380
Good. Thank you.

51
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,320
- What in the hell is going on? - Excellent question.

52
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,160
The answer you're looking for lies right here.

53
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,030
Who are you, really?

54
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,090
Really?

55
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,260
I am just a figment of your imagination.

56
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,670
Damn, what a gullible breed.

57
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,380
I'm serious, fellas. You're lucky to be alive after a blast like that.

58
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,250
- What blast? - The underground gas vein, genius.

59
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,690
You should exercise a lot more caution before firing.

60
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,490
I'll tell you that right now. Especially you.

61
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,830
Have yourselves checked out with E.M.S. before you leave.

62
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,440
I'm sorry about back there.

63
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,000
That happens.

64
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,740
Didn't used to.

65
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,910
The spirit's willing, Kay, but...

66
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,750
the rest of me...

67
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,520
They're beautiful, aren't they?

68
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,750
What?

69
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,490
The stars.

70
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,500
We never just look anymore.

71
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,460
No.

72
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,800
I'll tell you, Kay...

73
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,540
I will miss the chase.

74
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:36,770
I will miss the chase.

75
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:42,970
No, Dee...

76
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,210
you won't.

77
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,620
Freeze!

78
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,890
N.Y.P.D., freeze!

79
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,790
All yours, Edwards.

80
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,360
Freeze means stop!

81
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,230
What the hell?

82
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,740
It just be raining black people in New York.

83
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,600
Do you see this?

84
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,680
N.Y.P.D.!

85
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,610
It means I will knock your punk-ass down!

86
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,200
He's coming!

87
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,180
Yeah, and when he gets here, I'll arrest his ass too.

88
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,350
You trying to catch a beat down?

89
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,920
What's up?

90
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,930
He's coming.

91
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,100
He's coming because I failed. Now he'll kill me.

92
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,600
You pissing everybody off today, huh?

93
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,030
You don't understand.

94
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,430
Your world's going to end.

95
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,770
What the hell are you?

96
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,710
Watch that ledge. Watch it.

97
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,710
Come down. We'll get those eyes fixed. Don't even worry about it.

98
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,950
Wait a minute. Let me talk to you!

99
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,730
<i>I go out. I work my butt off</i> <i>to make a living.</i>

100
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,930
<i>All I want is to come home</i> <i>to a nice clean house...</i>

101
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,000
<i>with a nice fat steak</i> <i>on the table...</i>

102
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,710
<i>but instead I get this.</i> <i>Looks like poison.</i>

103
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,070
<i>but instead I get this.</i> <i>Looks like poison.</i>

104
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,870
<i>Don't you take that away!</i> <i>I'm eating that, damn it!</i>

105
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,280
<i>It is poison, isn't it?</i>

106
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,140
<i>I swear to God,</i> <i>I wouldn't be surprised if it was...</i>

107
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,980
<i>the way you skulk around</i> <i>like a dog been hit too much.</i>

108
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,580
<i>Or ain't been hit enough!</i> <i>I can't make up my mind.</i>

109
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,590
<i>You're useless, Beatrice.</i>

110
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,490
<i>The only thing that pulls its weight</i> <i>around here is my goddamn truck!</i>

111
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,260
Figures.

112
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,910
What the heck is it, Edgar?

113
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,350
Get your big butt back in the house.

114
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:57,460
Place projectile weapon on the ground.

115
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,370
You can have my gun...

116
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,800
when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers.

117
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,210
Your proposal is acceptable.

118
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,350
Edgar, what on earth was that?

119
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,680
Sugar.

120
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,350
I've never seen sugar do that.

121
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,530
Give me sugar.

122
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,760
In water.

123
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,370
More.

124
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,100
More.

125
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,790
Your skin is hanging off your bones.

126
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,890
Oh, yeah.

127
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,570
Is that better?

128
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,670
"The perpetrator then blinked two sets of eyelids."

129
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,730
You mean blinked with both eyes?

130
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,010
No, sir. He blinked one set, then a completely different set.

131
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,600
You know, like high beams and low beams.

132
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,440
Was that before...

133
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:31,010
or after he drew the weapon that you claim evaporated into a million pieces?

134
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,920
After, sir.

135
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:37,530
Why is it that no other officers saw either of these events?

136
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,590
Some other officers are soggy around the midsection.

137
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,660
I guess that's why they couldn't keep up.

138
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,430
If you were half the man I am...

139
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,200
What the hell? I am <i>half</i> the man that you are.

140
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,760
- What is your problem? - You being all up in my damn face.

141
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,170
- I think he threw him off the roof. - Maybe you're next.

142
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,710
- I want to talk to you. Now. - Ten minutes, take your best shot.

143
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,550
Take ten minutes on a Stairmaster, you pudgy bastard.

144
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,890
I believe you. Laurel Weaver, Deputy Medical Examiner.

145
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,950
Find me at the morgue on 26th. I'll show you.

146
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,050
Wait.

147
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,390
Wait a minute!

148
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:19,670
You're Dr. Weaver with the coroner's office working on theJohn Doe?

149
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,170
- Yes, that's right. - Will you look at this, please?

150
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,000
Some night, huh?

151
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,570
Yeah, some night.

152
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,480
They were gills, not eyelids.

153
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,710
Gills. He was out of breath.

154
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,790
Who are you?

155
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,690
Did he say anything to you?

156
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,850
Yeah, the world was coming to an end.

157
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,590
Did he say when?

158
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,200
Would you recognize his weapon if you saw it again?

159
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,760
Absolutely.

160
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,110
Come on. Let's take a ride.

161
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,170
Wait a minute. Look, I got tons of paperwork...

162
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,550
- Right. It's all done. - Good work, Edwards.

163
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,550
You really ran this dude down on foot? That's tough, kid.

164
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,280
That's double tough.

165
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:20,570
<i>So who exactly are you with?</i>

166
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,530
<i>So who exactly are you with?</i>

167
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,040
<i>F.B.I.? N.S.A.?</i>

168
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,430
<i>I'm part of a bureau</i> <i>that licenses, monitors and polices...</i>

169
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,840
<i>alien activity</i> <i>on the planet Earth.</i>

170
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,240
<i>Whatever.</i>

171
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,800
<i>We're here.</i>

172
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,380
- This is where we're going? - Yeah.

173
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,380
This is JackJeebs' spot. He buys from chain snatchers.

174
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,580
- He doesn't even sell guns. - Really?

175
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,990
All right, look.

176
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:48,220
I'll slide in and put my thing down. But when I come out I want answers.

177
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,060
Go put your thing down.

178
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,660
Officer Eduardo.

179
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,830
How did these get here? I thought I turned them in to the authorities.

180
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:04,340
The way I hear it you're into something hotter than stolen Rolexes.

181
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,340
I'm a huge crack dealer now, but I work here as I love the hours.

182
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,180
I'm talking about guns, smart ass.

183
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,580
- Weird ones. - Come on. What you see is what I got.

184
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,020
Why don't you show him the imports, Jeebs?

185
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,120
- Hiya, Kay. How are you? - Show him the imports right now.

186
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,350
I got out of that business a long time ago.

187
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,520
- Why do you lie to me? I hate it. - Just hold on a second.

188
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,760
- I'm gonna count to three. - He'll do it, Jeebs.

189
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:33,100
- One... - That man does not look stable.

190
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,070
- He's crazy when he's like this. - He's always crazy.

191
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,330
Why don't you get a massage? Take a cruise.

192
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,470
- Drop the weapon. Hands on your head! - I warned him.

193
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,980
- Drop it! Don't make me kill you. - You warned him.

194
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,420
You insensitive prick!

195
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,550
Do you have any idea how much that stings?

196
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,320
Show us the merchandise or you'll lose another head, Jeebs.

197
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,200
Mr. Edwards?

198
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,480
Right there. The one in the middle.

199
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:24,150
You sold a reverberating carbonizer with mutate capacity...

200
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,820
to an unlicensed cephlapoid! Jeebs, you piece of...

201
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,550
He looked all right to me.

202
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,820
- Assassination. Who's the target? - I don't know.

203
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,990
- Goddamn it, Jeebs! - I don't know!

204
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,630
All that's confiscated.

205
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,690
I want you on the next transport off this rock...

206
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,100
or I'll shoot you where it don't grow back.

207
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,170
And I'm going to be back to talk about them Rolexes.

208
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,970
Searching for a handle on the moment?

209
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,170
I can't help you.

210
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,800
The only comfort I can offer...

211
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,310
is my promise that tomorrow morning you won't remember a thing.

212
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,610
That's not exactly some shit you just forget.

213
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,170
Ever seen one of these?

214
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,210
She looks over to her husband...

215
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,550
then sets it back down in her lap and says...

216
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,890
"Honey, this one's eating my popcorn."

217
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,330
Get it?

218
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,390
- Yeah. - "Eating my popcorn."

219
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,440
Gotta go. Thanks for the egg rolls, kid.

220
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,000
Wait a minute.

221
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,410
Who are you?

222
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,970
See what I mean about tequila? You're a bright young man, James.

223
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:00,110
But you need to lay off the sauce. I'll see you bright and early, 9:00.

224
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,520
Be there...

225
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,880
or be square.

226
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,700
Well, well, well.

227
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,870
Moving right in, are we? Think we own the place?

228
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,580
I got an eviction notice for you boys.

229
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,310
Just what exactly do you think you're doing here?

230
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,620
Taking care of your pest problem.

231
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,210
Pest problem?

232
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,390
Pest?

233
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,720
Yeah, you got a hell of an infestation.

234
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,630
You know, I've noticed an infestation here.

235
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,360
Everywhere I look in fact.

236
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:52,390
Nothing but undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious pond scum...

237
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,200
totally convinced of their own superiority...

238
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,610
as they scurry about their short...

239
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,580
pointless lives.

240
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,570
Well, yeah.

241
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,410
Don't you want to get rid of them?

242
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,310
In the worst way.

243
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,520
Help you?

244
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,950
This dude gave me this card...

245
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,360
Elevator.

246
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,310
You're late. Sit down.

247
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,990
My name is Zed.

248
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,990
You're all here because you're the best of the best.

249
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:30,400
Marines, Air Force, Navy SEALs, Army Rangers, N.Y.P.D.

250
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,300
And we're looking for one of you.

251
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,900
Just one.

252
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,910
What will follow is a series of simple tests...

253
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,840
for motor skills, concentration, stamina.

254
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,910
I see we have a question.

255
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,180
I'm sorry, maybe you already answered this but...

256
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,240
why exactly are we here?

257
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,610
Son.

258
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,250
Second LieutenantJakeJensen. West Point. Graduate with honors.

259
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,290
We're here because you want the best of the best of the best, sir!

260
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,370
What's so funny, Edwards?

261
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,830
Your boy, Captain America, here.

262
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,930
"The best of the best of the best, sir!"

263
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,870
"With honors."

264
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,800
He's just really excited, and he has no clue why we're here.

265
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,410
That's very funny to me.

266
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,720
Y'all ain't laughing, though.

267
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,450
Okay, let's get going.

268
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,350
Want to get down on this?

269
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,010
Edwards, what the hell happened?

270
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,830
Hesitated.

271
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:33,550
May I ask why you felt little Tiffany deserved to die?

272
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,050
She was the only one that actually seemed dangerous at the time, sir.

273
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,610
How'd you decide that?

274
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,590
First, I was going to pop this guy hanging from the streetlight...

275
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,460
but I realized he's just working out.

276
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:46,520
How'd I feel if somebody bust me in my ass while I'm on the treadmill?

277
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,360
Then I saw this snarling beast guy...

278
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,800
and I noticed he had a tissue in his hand and realized...

279
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,100
he's not snarling, he's sneezing.

280
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,700
Ain't no real threat there.

281
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,260
Then I saw Tiffany.

282
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,210
I'm thinking, eight-year-old white girl, middle of the ghetto...

283
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,310
bunch of monsters at night with quantum physics books.

284
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,350
She about to start some shit, Zed.

285
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,210
She's about eight. Those books are way too advanced for her.

286
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,690
If you ask me, she's up to something.

287
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,720
Honestly, I'd appreciate it if you eased up off my back about it.

288
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,890
Or do I owe her an apology?

289
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,900
That was a good shot though, right?

290
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,470
He's got a real problem with authority.

291
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,910
So do I.

292
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,580
But this kid ran down a cephlapoid on foot, boss.

293
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,640
That's got to be tough enough.

294
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,750
Let's hope you know what you're doing.

295
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,890
Gentlemen.

296
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,500
Congratulations. You're all we've come to expect...

297
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,560
from years of government training.

298
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,870
If you'll just follow me, we have one more test. An eye exam.

299
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,020
Where are you going?

300
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,730
Hey, man, what the hell is all this?

301
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,790
In the mid-1950s the government started an underfunded agency...

302
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,460
with the simple and laughable purpose of establishing contact...

303
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,370
with a race not of this planet.

304
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,200
Look directly at the end of this device.

305
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:38,370
Everyone thought the agency was a joke, except the aliens...

306
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,880
who made contact March 2, 1961, outside New York.

307
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,940
There were nine of us the first night.

308
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,110
Seven agents, one astronomer...

309
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,550
and one dumb kid who got lost on the wrong back road.

310
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,550
Oh, you brought that tall man some flowers.

311
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,320
This way.

312
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,750
They were a group of intergalactic refugees.

313
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:00,730
Wanted Earth for an apolitical zone for creatures without a planet.

314
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,600
Did you ever see "Casablanca"?

315
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,600
Same thing, except no Nazis.

316
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,900
We agreed and concealed all the evidence of their landing.

317
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,900
So these are real flying saucers...

318
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,170
and the World's Fair was a cover-up for their landing?

319
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,770
Why else hold it in Queens?

320
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,680
More nonhumans arrive every year and live among us in secret.

321
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,920
Look, I'm sorry. Not to change the subject...

322
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,980
but when was the last time you had a CAT scan?

323
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,050
Six months ago. It's company policy.

324
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,950
Make another appointment.

325
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,150
Tell your boy Zed I had an absolutely wonderful time...

326
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,360
and thank you for everything but show me the door.

327
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:36,800
All right. I'm going to get some coffee. You want some coffee?

328
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,700
No, thank you, I'm fine.

329
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,800
How you doing, fellas?

330
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,210
- Shit! - Okay.

331
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:50,280
- That's not decaf, is it? - Viennese cinnamon.

332
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:54,540
Don't tell me we only got powdered stuff for cream. I hate that stuff.

333
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,720
Well, that's good. Good. Good.

334
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,220
You guys getting along all right?

335
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,450
Don't work too hard.

336
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,590
So, you guys seen the cahuengas on...

337
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,660
Sure you don't want coffee?

338
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,470
Cahuengas, yeah, but how about the zapoata?

339
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,470
All right, kid, here's the deal.

340
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,880
At any given time there are around 1,500 aliens on the planet.

341
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:24,180
Most of them right here in Manhattan.

342
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,220
Most of them are decent enough. Just trying to make a living.

343
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,950
- Cab drivers. - Not as many as you'd think.

344
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:33,580
Humans, for the most part, don't have a clue. Don't want or need one.

345
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:38,250
They're happy. They think they have a good bead on things.

346
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,450
Why the big secret? People are smart. They can handle it.

347
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,020
A person is smart.

348
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,160
People are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals. You know it.

349
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,000
Fifteen hundred years ago, everybody knew...

350
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,700
the Earth was the center of the universe.

351
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,240
Five hundred years ago, everybody knew the Earth was flat.

352
00:31:56,310 --> 00:32:00,650
And fifteen minutes ago, you knew that people were alone on this planet.

353
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,310
Imagine what you'll know...

354
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,950
tomorrow.

355
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,590
- What's the catch? - The catch.

356
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,690
The catch is you will sever every human contact.

357
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,960
Nobody will ever know you exist anywhere.

358
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,960
Ever.

359
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,470
I'll give you to sunrise to think it over.

360
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,410
Is it worth it?

361
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,140
Yeah, it's worth it...

362
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,050
if you're strong enough.

363
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,640
What's up, pops?

364
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,410
All right, I'm in...

365
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,930
because there's some next-level shit going on here, and I'm with that.

366
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,330
But before y'all beam me up, there's a few things to understand.

367
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,390
First off, you chose me...

368
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,370
so you recognize the skills.

369
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,270
I don't want nobody calling me "son" or "kid" or "sport." Cool?

370
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,830
Whatever you say, slick.

371
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:10,780
But I need to tell you something about all your skills.

372
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,250
As of right now...

373
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:13,940
As of right now...

374
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,850
they mean precisely...

375
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,410
dick.

376
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:33,090
- Purpose of trip? - Diplomatic mission.

377
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,500
- Duration of stay? - Lunch.

378
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,130
Any fruits or vegetables?

379
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,810
You want to stay away from that guy.

380
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,480
He's grouchy.

381
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,650
Three-hour delay in customs after a 17 trillion mile trip...

382
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,720
gonna make anybody cranky. Right?

383
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,790
What branch of the government do we report to?

384
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,700
- None, they ask too many questions. - So who pays for all this?

385
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,700
We hold patents on a few gadgets we confiscated from the visitors.

386
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:12,740
Velcro, microwave ovens, liposuction.

387
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,800
This is a fascinating little gadget.

388
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,710
It'll replace CDs soon.

389
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,870
Guess I'll have to buy the "White Album" again.

390
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,940
That's fun. It's a universal translator.

391
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,350
We're not even supposed to have it. I'll tell you why.

392
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,680
Human thought is so primitive it's looked upon...

393
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,780
as an infectious disease in some of the better galaxies.

394
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,850
That kind of makes you proud, doesn't it?

395
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,260
What's this?

396
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,330
Just be calm.

397
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,560
Relax!

398
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,000
Watch your head!

399
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,870
Somebody get him some ice.

400
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,840
Move! Just move when it's coming at you!

401
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,870
Damn!

402
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,210
I'm going to pay for that!

403
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,560
This thing caused the 1977 New York blackout.

404
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,720
Practical joke by the Great Attractor.

405
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,630
He thought it was funny as hell.

406
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,290
Sorry, y'all.

407
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,040
It was a accident. Sorry.

408
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,740
Observation, the heart of our little endeavor.

409
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,140
Meet the twins Blblup and Bob.

410
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,970
This map shows the location of every registered alien on Earth...

411
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:31,920
at any given time. Some are under constant surveillance.

412
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,480
Everyone on those screens is an alien.

413
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,550
In public, they're normal as you are, but in private, well...

414
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,150
You'll get the idea.

415
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,720
Oh, man.

416
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,790
Doesn't make any sense, does it?

417
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:47,660
Well, no, it makes perfect sense.

418
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:51,570
When I was in third grade, everyone said I was crazy...

419
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,370
but I knew our teacher was from Venus or something like that.

420
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,930
Ms. Edelson. Jupiter, actually. Well, one of the moons.

421
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,940
<i>Class...</i>

422
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,380
<i>be quiet and pay attention!</i>

423
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:08,860
<i>If I have to tell you</i> <i>one more time</i>...

424
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,290
Edwards!

425
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,760
Let's put it on.

426
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,420
Put what on?

427
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,590
The last suit you'll ever wear.

428
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,770
<i>You will dress only in attire</i> <i>specially sanctioned...</i>

429
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,970
<i>by MIB special services.</i>

430
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:37,310
<i>You'll conform to the identity</i> <i>we give you.</i>

431
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,320
<i>Eat where we tell you.</i> <i>Live where we tell you.</i>

432
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,990
<i>From now on...</i>

433
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,720
<i>you'll have no identifying marks</i> <i>of any kind.</i>

434
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:47,780
<i>You'll not stand out</i> <i>in any way.</i>

435
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,700
<i>Your entire image is crafted to leave...</i>

436
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:53,030
<i>no lasting memory</i> <i>with anyone you encounter.</i>

437
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,830
<i>You are a rumor...</i>

438
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,900
<i>recognizable only as d¨¦j¨¤ vu</i> <i>and dismissed just as quickly.</i>

439
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:02,640
<i>You don't exist.</i> <i>You were never even born.</i>

440
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:08,310
<i>Anonymity is your name.</i> <i>Silence, your native tongue.</i>

441
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,180
<i>You're no longer part of the system.</i>

442
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:16,250
<i>You're above the system.</i> <i>Over it. Beyond it.</i>

443
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:19,160
<i>We're "them." We're "they."</i>

444
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,620
<i>We are the Men in Black.</i>

445
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,730
You know what the difference is between you and me?

446
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:37,340
I make this look good.

447
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:41,110
We're going to go for a ride.

448
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,520
I'll put you down here for a minute then Daddy will be right back.

449
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,610
Okay, now we're ready to go for a little ride.

450
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,780
We're going to meet with Daddy's friend who you'll like.

451
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,260
Let's see.

452
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,020
Bee...

453
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,030
we've got the deposed sur-prefect of Singalee...

454
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,590
touching down in the forest outside Portland tonight.

455
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:38,500
- <i>Humanoid?</i> - You wish. Bring a sponge.

456
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,770
And here. Red letter from last night.

457
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,440
We had an unauthorized landing somewhere in upstate New York.

458
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,670
Kay, keep your ears open on this one.

459
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:51,280
We're not hosting an intergalactic kegger down here.

460
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,680
Well, we got a skimmer.

461
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,020
Landed alien out of zone. Who is it?

462
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,250
Redgick.

463
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,160
He's not cleared to leave Manhattan...

464
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:03,890
but he's way out of town now, stuck on the New Jersey Turnpike.

465
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,800
Why don't you take junior with you?

466
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,730
This is a good one for him to warm up on.

467
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,400
Go get him, tiger.

468
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:19,480
"We're not hosting an intergalactic kegger."

469
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,810
Zed.

470
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,110
He just...

471
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,750
Unlimited technology from the whole universe...

472
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,790
and we cruise around in a Ford P.O.S.

473
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,090
Fasten your seat belt.

474
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,730
We got to work on your people skills.

475
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,500
You'd get a much better reaction if you were more polite.

476
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:45,030
- Fasten your seat belt, please. - Good. Did you hurt yourself?

477
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,470
Oh, the red button there. Don't ever, ever touch it.

478
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,190
All right, pop, that'll be $72 there.

479
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,820
Okay, sweetie, let me pay the impolite driver.

480
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,920
Six is up!

481
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:17,860
- Where is Ivan? - Gave him a break.

482
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,090
You can kill us both, but you will not find the galaxy.

483
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,290
You're right about one thing.

484
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,230
You're not going anywhere, pal.

485
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:08,070
What's going on?

486
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,390
I'd like to see your license and registration, please.

487
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,590
Like to see your <i>other</i> license and registration, please.

488
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:40,080
You're restricted to Manhattan. Where are you going, Redgie?

489
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,010
It's my wife. She's... Well, look.

490
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,410
All right. No big deal.

491
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:51,680
Okay, you come with me, Redge.

492
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:55,920
And you handle this.

493
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,160
What! Me?

494
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:59,260
It's easy. You just catch.

495
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:01,200
- He knows what he's doing? - He does it all the time.

496
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:02,760
Let the man work.

497
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:14,680
Damn, man! So... Something's peaking!

498
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,740
Croagg the midwife is at 54th and Madison.

499
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,120
You're headed out of town. What's going on?

500
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,350
- We're meeting someone. - Who you meeting?

501
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,580
It's a ship.

502
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,650
I saw no departure clearance for today.

503
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:26,390
- You didn't? - No.

504
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,330
- It's an emergency. - Kay! Kay!

505
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,730
- You're doing fine, ace. - Kiss my ass!

506
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,130
What kind of emergency? What's the rush to get off the planet?

507
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,690
Excuse me, miss.

508
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:36,930
We just don't like the neighborhood anymore.

509
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,170
Some of the new arrivals.

510
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,470
New arrivals? Have anything to do with the crash last night?

511
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,200
Excuse me, miss!

512
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,300
Oh, man.

513
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,650
Oh, man!

514
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:54,710
Look.

515
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:56,650
Oh, man.

516
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:00,250
Congratulations, Redge. It's a...

517
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,650
squid.

518
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,890
He's...

519
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,770
actually kind of...

520
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,070
cute.

521
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:27,350
Anything about that seem unusual to you?

522
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,220
What would scare Redgick so badly he'd risk a warp jump with a newborn?

523
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,560
We'll check the hot sheets.

524
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,690
These are the hot sheets?

525
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:45,760
Best investigative reporting on the planet.

526
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,370
Read the "New York Times" if you want. They get lucky sometimes.

527
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,780
I cannot believe you're looking for tips in the supermarket tabloids.

528
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,140
Not looking for.

529
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,880
Found.

530
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,760
Wait, slow down.

531
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,100
Why?

532
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:17,900
Give her time to get the wrong impression. Makes things smoother.

533
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:20,900
Can I help you, gentlemen?

534
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:24,410
Yes, ma'am. I'm Agent Manheim, this is Agent Black, with the F.B.I.

535
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,470
We'd like to talk about your visitor.

536
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,210
You here to make fun of me too?

537
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,310
We at the F.B.I. do not have a sense of humor we're aware of. May we come in?

538
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,020
Sure.

539
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:36,780
- Thank you. - Lemonade?

540
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,350
Oh, yes, please.

541
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:45,360
<i>The chief of police himself come</i> <i>up to the house...</i>

542
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,530
and did a full-out professional investigation.

543
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:50,540
Took a police report and writ down everything I said...

544
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,270
from A to Z, not believing one thing I said.

545
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,310
Sort of poking fun at me.

546
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,570
Then they asked, "If he was murdered...

547
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,200
how was he able to walk back in the house?"

548
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,540
I gotta admit to you that one got me sorta stumped.

549
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,280
But I know Edgar and that wasn't Edgar.

550
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:10,860
It was like something was wearing Edgar.

551
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,760
Like a suit.

552
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:16,720
An Edgar suit.

553
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,300
Dude was that ugly before he was an alien.

554
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,140
I'm sorry.

555
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:32,540
Go on.

556
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:34,710
Anyway...

557
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:36,980
I come to and he's gone.

558
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,180
- Did he say anything? - Yes.

559
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,080
He asked me for some water.

560
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,620
Some sugar water.

561
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,620
- Sugar water? - Yeah, I remember that right.

562
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:49,360
'Cause I thought that was odd.

563
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:54,060
That he asked me for sugar water and not lemonade or ice water or...

564
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:55,500
regular water or...

565
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:57,060
tap water.

566
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:00,730
All right, Beatrice. There was no alien.

567
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:03,470
The flash of light you saw in the sky was not a U.F.O.

568
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:06,140
Swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket...

569
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:08,080
and refracted the light from Venus.

570
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:11,140
Wait a minute. You flash that thing...

571
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,380
it erases her memory and you just make up a new one?

572
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:15,110
A standard-issue neuralizer.

573
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:17,920
That weak-ass story is the best you can come up with?

574
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:19,320
All right.

575
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:22,730
On a more personal note, Edgar ran off with an old girlfriend.

576
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,030
You'll go stay with your mom a couple nights.

577
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,190
You'll get over it and decide you're better off.

578
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:30,760
Yeah, because he never appreciated you anyway.

579
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,570
In fact, you know what?

580
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,040
<i>You</i> kicked <i>him</i> out. And now that he's gone...

581
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:39,480
you'll go into town, find yourself some nice dresses.

582
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:43,710
Get yourself some shoes. Find somewhere you could get a facial.

583
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,120
And...

584
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:48,520
hire a decorator to come here quick because, damn!

585
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,490
Yo, Kay, check it out. When do I get my own flashy...

586
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:00,400
memory messer-upper thing?

587
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,300
When you grow up.

588
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:06,400
Please, not green.

589
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:08,880
Damn.

590
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,440
I don't suppose you know what kind of alien life-form...

591
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:15,000
leaves a green spectral trail and craves sugar water?

592
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:18,750
Wait. That was on "FinalJeopardy" last night.

593
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:22,150
- Damn, Alex said it was... - Zed, we have a bug.

594
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:23,780
So.

595
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,520
What? We don't like bugs?

596
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:27,530
Bugs thrive on carnage, tiger.

597
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:32,250
They consume, infest, destroy, live off the destruction of other species.

598
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:34,830
- You were stung as a child, right? - Listen, kid.

599
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:39,240
Imagine a giant cockroach with unlimited strength...

600
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:43,040
a massive inferiority complex, and a real short temper...

601
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:46,480
is tear-assing around Manhattan Island in a brand-new Edgar suit.

602
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,770
Sound like fun?

603
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,280
What's the move?

604
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,750
With the bug in town, we'll watch the morgues.

605
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,260
Where do you want contestant number three?

606
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,000
Just leave it there.

607
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:13,730
What's with the cat?

608
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:16,640
There's a problem with the cat. Sign here.

609
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:19,140
- What's the problem with the cat? - It's your problem.

610
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,480
I hate the living.

611
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,610
Shall we?

612
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,120
Oh, my God!

613
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:05,210
Buddy, what are you?

614
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,930
Subject was approximately 112 degrees at time of autopsy...

615
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,400
indicating an increase in body temperature.

616
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:21,460
Examiner tried to verify this rectally...

617
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,770
only to find the subject was without rectum.

618
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,540
- Which is, needless to say, really... - Weird.

619
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:29,480
I'm Dr. Leo Manville, Department of Public Health.

620
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:31,480
This is Dr. White.

621
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,710
You boys must not have much of a home life.

622
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:38,120
We watch the morgues very carefully. Seen something unusual?

623
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:40,660
I'd say so. Triple homicide.

624
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:42,800
The first body was pretty normal, except he was broken in half.

625
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,260
The first body was pretty normal, except he was broken in half.

626
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:48,100
But when I opened up the other two, well... Let me show you.

627
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:58,310
There's a skeletal structure unlike any I've ever seen before.

628
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,870
I'll look at it.

629
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,440
Dr. White, why don't you and Dr. Weaver check out the other body?

630
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,010
This way, Doctor.

631
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,380
This one's even stranger.

632
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:08,710
I did a full laparotomy.

633
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:12,160
I began with the stomach. We can start with the gastroesophageal junction.

634
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:14,220
Whichever you prefer.

635
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:17,700
Let's start wherever you started at.

636
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,600
Okeydokey.

637
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,900
- Your cat? - Guess it is now.

638
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,470
It came in with the body. Dive right in.

639
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:34,380
I'm sure he won't mind.

640
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,910
You have really pretty eyes.

641
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:41,920
Thank you.

642
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:46,590
Feel that?

643
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:49,990
Where the pyloric junction would be? Push it aside.

644
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:53,400
Notice anything strange? Stomach, liver, lungs?

645
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:54,630
No, all fine.

646
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,360
Doctor, they're all missing.

647
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,770
Well, of course.

648
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,310
That's obviously the first thing I noticed.

649
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:06,070
What I was pointing out is the fact that there are no...

650
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:08,300
pieces...

651
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:10,040
of them left.

652
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,310
You know, so they're intact.

653
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,980
Wherever they are. Whole, somewhere. That we can be sure of.

654
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,550
Have we met before?

655
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,520
I'm having the strangest feeling of d¨¦j¨¤ vu.

656
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,230
- Yeah, me too. - Really?

657
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,900
Okay, you want to know what I really think?

658
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:30,560
But don't tell him, he's under enough stress.

659
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,630
I don't think it's a real body.

660
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,870
I think it's some kind of transport unit for something else altogether.

661
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,770
The question is, what?

662
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:40,640
Is this freaking you out?

663
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:44,140
No, girl.

664
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,050
You know what I like to do sometimes when it's late?

665
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,520
No.

666
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:54,620
Dr. White.

667
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,920
Excuse me.

668
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:03,660
What do you think?

669
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,700
Very interesting. She got a real Queen-of-the-Undead thing going...

670
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:09,940
- Of the body. - Great body.

671
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:11,840
The dead body.

672
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,410
Man, you have to look at that thing.

673
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:16,410
You recognize him?

674
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:20,590
Yeah, he looks like the big guy I saw down at headquarters, only deader.

675
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:22,640
What do you think killed him?

676
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,250
- A bug? - Dr. White.

677
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:26,990
You're up, slugger.

678
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,090
Look at this.

679
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:35,090
What the hell is that?

680
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,310
Must...

681
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,550
To prevent...

682
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,990
contest.

683
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:05,830
It's okay. What are you trying to say?

684
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,230
To prevent...

685
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,960
"To prevent..."

686
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:10,330
Struggle?

687
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,470
No.

688
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,800
To prevent...

689
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:15,270
War?

690
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:16,810
War.

691
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:21,300
The galaxy...

692
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:24,080
...is on...

693
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,980
...Orion's...

694
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,290
...be- be...

695
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,050
What is word?

696
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:36,060
The bed?

697
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:39,390
Belt? Orion's belt?

698
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:02,050
"To prevent war the galaxy is on Orion's belt."

699
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,780
What the hell does that mean?

700
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:09,120
Doctor...

701
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:12,290
- whatever, come here! - Dr. "Whatever"?

702
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:14,930
You guys aren't really from the Department of Health, are you?

703
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,370
Rosenberg! Ah, damn.

704
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:21,670
The Arquillians will not like this. He was one of the royal family.

705
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:23,400
I knew it. This is an alien.

706
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,000
And you're from some government agency trying to keep it under wraps.

707
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,450
He said, "To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's belt."

708
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,950
This makes total sense. How else do you explain New York?

709
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:35,510
The other day I was in this cab and this guy...

710
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,550
"Galaxy on Orion's belt" doesn't make sense.

711
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:42,290
That's what the little dude inside the big dude's head said. Right?

712
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,690
Right after...

713
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,730
Damn, man. You did the flashy thing already.

714
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:50,000
Whoever you are, you have to show I.D. if you're gonna be in the morgue.

715
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:53,060
Of course, young lady. Look at this for me, please.

716
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,470
- Would you stop that? - What?

717
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:58,070
That thing is gonna give her brain cancer or something.

718
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:00,340
Never hurt her before. We have to close all the doors here.

719
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:02,400
Special Services will be here any minute.

720
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,280
"Before"! How many times have you flashy-thinged that poor woman?

721
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:06,510
Couple.

722
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:09,210
- No worries about no long-term damage? - Little.

723
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:11,960
- Have you ever flashy-thinged me? - No.

724
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:15,260
- I ain't playing with you! Have you? - No.

725
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:27,370
I think I should be in charge of the flashy thing department.

726
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,070
Not while I'm around, ace.

727
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:31,630
You won't be happy till you fricassee someone's brain out.

728
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,940
We got two dead aliens and a Deputy Medical Examiner...

729
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:36,000
- that needs a new memory. - Yes, sir.

730
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:40,810
Make it a happy memory.

731
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,750
Where is it?

732
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,060
Hey, Zed.

733
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,330
Doesn't anyone ever get any sleep around here?

734
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:08,470
The twins keep us on Centaurian time. It's a 37-hour day.

735
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:12,670
Give it a few months, you'll get used to it. Or have a psychotic episode.

736
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:14,180
Here's Orion.

737
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:17,740
It's a grouping of the brightest stars in the northern sky.

738
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,620
- And here's Orion's belt. - That's what the little guy said.

739
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:24,420
"To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's belt."

740
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:27,080
Junior, there are no galaxies on Orion's belt.

741
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,720
The belt is just these three stars.

742
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,460
Galaxies are huge. They're made up of billions of stars.

743
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:35,360
You heard wrong.

744
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,270
Look, whatever, I know what I heard.

745
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,730
Pretty lady.

746
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:27,810
The grumpy guy's story is starting to come into focus a little bit here.

747
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:31,550
You were the guy in the picture you showed me with the flowers.

748
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:35,790
And, I take it, she never got those flowers.

749
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,990
So, what, she ever get married or anything?

750
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,360
You know what they say.

751
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,930
"It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all."

752
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:47,440
Try it.

753
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,440
Take a look at this.

754
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:56,180
My God, they're all leaving.

755
01:00:56,250 --> 01:01:00,280
We've had 12 jump in the last hour. Redgick was just the first.

756
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:02,850
What do they know that we don't?

757
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,580
Why does a rat desert a ship?

758
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:08,320
Give me Lem Sat 4 with a proton induction thermoscan, please.

759
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:12,730
Thank you. Okay. Lem Sat 18.

760
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:16,130
All right, 4,000.

761
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:24,910
- That's an Arquillian battle cruiser. - We've got a dead Arquillian prince.

762
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:28,270
Speak of the devil.

763
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,910
They sound pissed.

764
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:31,810
Boys, translate that. Step on it.

765
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:35,610
Go to Rosenberg's jewelry store and see what you can turn up.

766
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,820
Give the kid a weapon.

767
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,970
- Series 4 de-atomizer. - That's what I'm talking about.

768
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,530
Noisy cricket.

769
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:02,140
Kay, no, no, come on, man.

770
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:04,740
You get a Series 4 de-atomizer...

771
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,410
I get a midget cricket?

772
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:12,780
Feel like I'm going to break this damn thing.

773
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,400
Hey, this is my truck!

774
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:03,230
Make sure you tell them that down at the impound.

775
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,640
Please.

776
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,060
Who breaks into a jewelry store and leaves all the jewels?

777
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:26,790
Somebody not looking for jewelry.

778
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,990
He had a serious crush on his cat.

779
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,970
Get down!

780
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:41,940
Man!

781
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,780
That's him. That's the bug!

782
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:47,320
In the Edgar suit!

783
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:11,730
We do not discharge our weapons in view of the public!

784
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:14,250
We ain't got time for this cover-up bullshit!

785
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:16,980
Have you forgotten? There's an alien battle cruiser...

786
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:19,950
There's always an alien battle cruiser or a Korilian death ray...

787
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:22,950
or an intergalactic plague about to wipe out life on this planet.

788
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:25,990
The only way people get on with their happy lives...

789
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:28,930
is they do not know about it!

790
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:35,400
Don't worry about the bug.

791
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:38,300
He's not leaving town. We've got his ship.

792
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,070
Zed, we need a containment crew...

793
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:50,270
<i>on MacDougal Street</i> <i>south of Houston.</i>

794
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:54,680
Containment may be a moot point, friend. The exodus continues.

795
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:58,420
It's like the party's over and the last one to leave gets stuck with the check.

796
01:04:58,490 --> 01:05:01,480
You sorry little ingrates!

797
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:11,100
<i>What about the Arquillians?</i>

798
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:13,700
We've only translated part of the message so far:

799
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:16,110
- "Deliver the galaxy." - <i>They don't want much, do they?</i>

800
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:17,840
Oh, it gets better.

801
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:19,840
They hold us responsible.

802
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:30,950
Where do you keep your dead?

803
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:32,720
I don't have any dead.

804
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:34,560
Where?

805
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:35,960
I don't know.

806
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:38,390
The city morgue?

807
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:51,330
That's three for a dollar, sir!

808
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:54,470
It was some light that refracted off of Venus...

809
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,380
into some swamp gas...

810
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:58,280
and that's what made the...

811
01:05:58,350 --> 01:05:59,680
All right, kid!

812
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,980
Excuse me. What's up?

813
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:04,780
The Arquillians want the galaxy, whatever the hell that means.

814
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:06,690
We need help, a professional.

815
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:10,250
Somebody with years of experience in intergalactic politics.

816
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:13,060
I just hope the little prick hasn't skipped town.

817
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:15,290
<i>May I have your attention?</i> <i>Thank you.</i>

818
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:17,390
<i>If you'll gather over here.</i>

819
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:20,130
<i>That's right, move in closer.</i> <i>That's good.</i>

820
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:24,710
<i>If you look right here,</i> <i>I'd appreciate it. Thank you.</i>

821
01:06:37,650 --> 01:06:40,770
That's the worse disguise ever. He's obviously an alien.

822
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:43,480
You don't like it, you can kiss my furry little butt.

823
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:45,510
You busy, Frank?

824
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:47,750
Can't talk now. My flight's leaving in...

825
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:50,310
- Get your paws off me! - Call the pound! We got a stray.

826
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:52,720
The dog owes my friend money.

827
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:54,320
Arquillians and bugs, Frank, what do you know?

828
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,760
- Nothing. - Nothing?

829
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,200
Stop it. Stop it. Okay. Okay.

830
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:03,970
Rosenberg wasn't some two-bit Arquillian.

831
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:07,440
He was the guardian of a whole galaxy. They thought he'd be safe on Earth.

832
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:09,170
The bug had other plans.

833
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:12,640
The galaxy is the best source for subatomic energy in the universe.

834
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:15,650
If the bugs get their slimy claws on it, kiss the Arquillians good-bye.

835
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,210
Ask about the belt.

836
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:19,450
Rosenberg mentioned a galaxy on Orion's belt.

837
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,080
- What's he mean? - Beats me.

838
01:07:22,590 --> 01:07:23,820
Not around.

839
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:28,850
They're rehearsing a ventriloquist act.

840
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:30,860
The galaxy is here!

841
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:32,590
What do you mean "here"?

842
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:35,430
Galaxy's millions of stars and planets. How's it here?

843
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:38,130
You humans! When will you learn size doesn't matter?

844
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:41,640
Just because something's important, doesn't mean it's not very small.

845
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:45,270
- How small? - Tiny. Like a marble or a jewel.

846
01:07:45,810 --> 01:07:48,440
If you'll excuse me, I gotta be walked before my flight.

847
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:50,540
All right. Get out of here.

848
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:55,390
If the galaxy's here, it's not on Orion's belt.

849
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,740
Boy, when you want attention...

850
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:20,140
Orion.

851
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:22,010
That's a pretty name.

852
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,140
What's this?

853
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:20,730
Yes, good, thank you.

854
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:24,140
Thank you for making sure the bell works.

855
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:28,550
What's up, FarmerJohn?

856
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,680
A man came in here earlier.

857
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:34,080
A dead man.

858
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,250
And that means what to me?

859
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:41,090
It was a very dear friend of mine.

860
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,090
I believe he had an animal with him.

861
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:47,000
It was a gift I gave him. A pet cat.

862
01:09:47,070 --> 01:09:48,900
It means worlds to me.

863
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:50,800
I'd like to have it back.

864
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:52,740
I'm gonna need a picture I. D...

865
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:54,470
written proof of ownership of the cat...

866
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:56,770
notarized proof of kinship with...

867
01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:58,940
the deceased.

868
01:09:59,010 --> 01:10:00,500
Don't do that.

869
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:03,310
Do what?

870
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:06,010
Don't do it.

871
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:10,280
Oh, man.

872
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:27,970
- Look, Kay, let me handle this one. - What?

873
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:31,030
All we gotta do is get a cat. It's not really that hard.

874
01:10:31,110 --> 01:10:33,770
But if you go in, you'll lay yourJack Webb on her.

875
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:37,220
Flash your brain ray all in her face. She'll wind up with leukemia.

876
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,720
She's a doctor. She don't need you flashing away her med school classes.

877
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:42,780
- Five minutes. - Two minutes.

878
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,290
- Where's the animal? - I told you I don't know.

879
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,730
Let's see if we can find it.

880
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,270
Hello!

881
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:07,640
Hello!

882
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:13,650
- How you doing? - Hello.

883
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:16,880
I'm Sergeant Friday, from the 26th precinct.

884
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,980
A cat came in with a corpse the other day.

885
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:22,000
- "Orion" on the name tag. - Yes, that's right.

886
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,530
This cat is a...

887
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:26,660
a witness in a murder case.

888
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:28,760
I'm gonna need to take him, ask him a few questions.

889
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:31,830
- I don't know where the cat is. - You don't?

890
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:35,070
No, but maybe you could take me with you instead.

891
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:39,440
Damn, you do start fast, don't you?

892
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:41,410
I'd really like to go with you...

893
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:44,210
now.

894
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:46,780
And exactly why is that?

895
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,620
There's something I need to show you.

896
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:59,890
Slow down, girl. You ain't got to hit the gas like that.

897
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:03,600
You don't understand. You really need to see this.

898
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:08,470
I will, I will. One thing, I got to drive. It's not some macho trip.

899
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:11,030
I'm saying that's the way I get down.

900
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:24,350
Look, stud, you're really not getting this.

901
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:27,990
There's something I need you to help me with.

902
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:41,510
- Freeze it, bug! - Christ, you are thick!

903
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:44,310
- How was I to know? - Should I have sung it for you?

904
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:46,110
If you weren't coming on like...

905
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:50,310
That is so typical. A woman shows a hint of sexual independence...

906
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:52,320
- Shut up! - Let her go, shiteater.

907
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:54,350
Listen, monkey-boy.

908
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:57,790
Compared to you humans, I'm on the top rung of the evolutionary ladder.

909
01:12:57,860 --> 01:12:59,920
- So can it. - You're breaking my heart.

910
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:01,990
Show me your face and I'll cure all your ills.

911
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:05,590
Ever pull wings off a fly? Care to see the fly get even?

912
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:07,190
How far can you go with no ship?

913
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:09,830
If that's what you call that space trash we got locked in the office.

914
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:13,140
- Put your weapons down! - Never going to happen, insect.

915
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:15,940
- It's okay. - How is it okay?

916
01:13:16,010 --> 01:13:18,310
I'm saying it's going to be okay.

917
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:20,210
Don't bet on it, meat sack.

918
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:31,550
Let me go!

919
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:43,870
Go on!

920
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:50,230
- Take me here. - No way.

921
01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:53,170
Take me!

922
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:11,460
He's in a cab!

923
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:36,690
Don't move! Don't move! Don't move!

924
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:38,520
Hey, man, what?

925
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:52,300
He's not leaving the planet in a cab. Let's go.

926
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:00,150
Come with me. Put up a bio-net all the way around Manhattan.

927
01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:02,050
If it's not human, I don't want it to leave this island.

928
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,680
What do we hear from our friends upstairs?

929
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:07,410
Same thing. "Deliver the galaxy."

930
01:15:07,490 --> 01:15:10,250
The bug has the galaxy but we have his ship. He's looking for a way out.

931
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:15,660
<i>Warning. Protonic fusion detection.</i>

932
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,640
What the hell they shooting at us for?

933
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:28,040
Battle rules, kid. First, we get an ultimatum...

934
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:31,010
then a warning shot, then a galactic standard week to respond.

935
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:34,350
A galactic standard week? How long is that?

936
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:35,750
One hour.

937
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:37,040
One hour?

938
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:38,580
Then what?

939
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:45,350
That's bullshit.

940
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:49,590
Kid, to keep the bugs from getting it, the Arquillians will destroy the galaxy.

941
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:51,690
And whatever planet it's on.

942
01:15:53,270 --> 01:15:56,070
- You're talking about us. - Sucks, huh?

943
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:01,900
I'm getting the location of every interstellar vehicle within 100 miles.

944
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:04,310
I already did. Frank took the last ship.

945
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:06,870
- Snedens Landing and Throg's Neck. - They're gone.

946
01:16:06,950 --> 01:16:08,610
- Atlantic City. - Adios.

947
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:10,510
- Bayonne? - Gone.

948
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:12,580
- There's Three Mile Island. - Gone.

949
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:14,140
- Y'all. - Staten Island?

950
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:15,880
- Gone, thank God. - Fellas!

951
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:19,120
We're running out of time. If the bug leaves with the galaxy...

952
01:16:19,190 --> 01:16:20,990
Hey, old guys!

953
01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:27,800
Do those still work?

954
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:45,240
- <i>You're coming with me.</i> - <i>What?</i>

955
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:47,590
It's a long trip. I'll need a snack.

956
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:48,520
It's a long trip. I'll need a snack.

957
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:55,990
Wait, the tunnel?

958
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:58,730
- You know a better way to Queens? - It's gonna be packed.

959
01:17:11,950 --> 01:17:14,070
- Remember the little red button? - Yeah.

960
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:15,780
Push the red button.

961
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:17,880
You may want to wear a seat belt.

962
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:32,460
You're much too tense. You're a young man.

963
01:17:32,530 --> 01:17:35,090
You need to relax. Learn to take some joy in your work.

964
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:36,660
You like music?

965
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,330
Man!

966
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:42,370
That's better.

967
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:15,060
You do know Elvis is dead?

968
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:17,670
No, Elvis is not dead. He just went home.

969
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:37,630
You don't want to eat me. I'm important on my planet. A queen!

970
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:40,860
A goddess, even. There are those who worship me.

971
01:18:40,930 --> 01:18:45,600
I'm not trying to impress you. Just letting you know it could start a war!

972
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:50,170
Good, war. That means more food for my family. All 78 million of them.

973
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:54,270
- That's a lot of mouths to feed. - Wonderful, but I'm staying here!

974
01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:17,930
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

975
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:21,130
Roaches check in.

976
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:24,470
But they don't check out.

977
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:30,140
<i>Warning.</i>

978
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:33,280
<i>Eight minutes</i> <i>to the destruction of Earth.</i>

979
01:19:34,990 --> 01:19:37,510
<i>Eight minutes to destruction.</i>

980
01:20:22,970 --> 01:20:25,960
We'll use pulsar level 5, with a sub-sonic implosion factor.

981
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,530
What?

982
01:20:27,610 --> 01:20:30,480
Just shoot the damn thing on the count of three. One...

983
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:32,380
two, three.

984
01:21:32,410 --> 01:21:34,070
You idiots!

985
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:37,010
You don't get it!

986
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:38,410
I've won.

987
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:39,380
It's over.

988
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:41,280
It's over.

989
01:21:41,350 --> 01:21:43,110
You milk suckers!

990
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:45,650
You don't matter.

991
01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:48,490
In a few seconds, you won't even be matter.

992
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,520
You're under arrest for violating sections of the Tycho Treaty.

993
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:54,460
So hand over whatever galaxy you are carrying and step away...

994
01:21:54,530 --> 01:21:57,400
from your busted-ass vehicle and put your hands on your head.

995
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,330
I'll put my hands...

996
01:22:04,770 --> 01:22:07,970
on my head.

997
01:22:12,110 --> 01:22:13,440
Like this?

998
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:44,940
That did not go at all how I'd planned.

999
01:22:45,010 --> 01:22:46,840
Whatever happens, don't let him on the second ship.

1000
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:50,080
- What are you talking about? - Keep him on this planet.

1001
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:52,140
Kay, where are you going?

1002
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:54,650
I'm getting my gun back.

1003
01:22:56,890 --> 01:22:58,220
Hey, bug!

1004
01:22:58,290 --> 01:23:01,190
You know how many of your kind I've swatted with a newspaper?

1005
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:04,030
You're nothing but a smear on the sports page to me...

1006
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:07,160
you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal parasite!

1007
01:23:07,530 --> 01:23:09,060
Eat me!

1008
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:10,660
Eat me!

1009
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:29,820
What's up?

1010
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:33,290
You just going to eat and run, huh? What about dessert?

1011
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,090
That's it?

1012
01:23:41,330 --> 01:23:44,330
Where you going? This party's just getting started.

1013
01:23:45,610 --> 01:23:47,100
Where're you going?

1014
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:49,600
Where you going?

1015
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:52,040
Listen.

1016
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:55,640
There's one way off this planet, baby, and that's through me.

1017
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:40,780
Where're you going?

1018
01:24:41,130 --> 01:24:42,820
Why you runnin', huh?

1019
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:45,090
I'm still standing.

1020
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:47,860
Come on. Bring it. Bring it.

1021
01:25:07,690 --> 01:25:10,210
I'm sorry. Was that your auntie?

1022
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:14,390
That must mean that's your uncle, huh?

1023
01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:19,390
You know you all look alike.

1024
01:25:26,970 --> 01:25:28,630
Well, well.

1025
01:25:29,010 --> 01:25:32,470
Big bad bug got a bit of a soft spot, huh?

1026
01:25:36,150 --> 01:25:38,380
What I can't understand is why you...

1027
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:41,350
got to come down here bringing all this ruckus.

1028
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:43,950
Snatching up galaxies and everything.

1029
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:49,120
My attitude is, don't start nothing, won't be nothing.

1030
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:58,100
You need to ease up out my face before something bad happen to you.

1031
01:26:00,170 --> 01:26:01,500
Too late.

1032
01:26:31,140 --> 01:26:33,770
Call the Arquillians. Tell them we have the galaxy.

1033
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,330
<i>You got it, friend.</i>

1034
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,230
Going to get your gun back, huh?

1035
01:26:39,550 --> 01:26:41,210
I like this gun.

1036
01:26:43,050 --> 01:26:46,450
While you were in there playing around, I was here doing all the work.

1037
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:49,420
First, I had to bean him in the head with this big rock.

1038
01:26:49,490 --> 01:26:51,480
Then I was going to hit him with a two-by-four.

1039
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:53,220
He kicked me. You know, it hurt.

1040
01:26:53,630 --> 01:26:56,690
Then I got the fire. I was "yah" with the fire.

1041
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:58,920
Not bad for your second day of work, is it?

1042
01:26:59,730 --> 01:27:03,170
This definitely rates about a 9.0 on my weird-shit-o-meter.

1043
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:07,230
Should've been here for the Zeronion migration in 1968.

1044
01:27:09,910 --> 01:27:11,900
I guess you weren't even alive in '68.

1045
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:20,850
Interesting job you guys have.

1046
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,730
Look, I know we got rules and everything, but...

1047
01:27:39,810 --> 01:27:44,210
she did help us bust that bug. Maybe we don't have to flashy thing her.

1048
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:49,410
Come on. Who she gonna tell? She hang out with all dead people.

1049
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:51,070
It's not for her.

1050
01:27:51,150 --> 01:27:52,810
It's for me.

1051
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:55,690
What?

1052
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:59,110
They're beautiful, aren't they?

1053
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:01,690
Stars.

1054
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:05,360
I never look at them anymore, but they actually are quite...

1055
01:28:08,130 --> 01:28:09,690
beautiful.

1056
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:16,740
Kay, you're frightening your partner.

1057
01:28:16,810 --> 01:28:20,540
I haven't been training a partner. I've been training a replacement.

1058
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:22,810
Wait a minute, Kay.

1059
01:28:23,050 --> 01:28:25,380
I cannot do this job by myself.

1060
01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:28,440
Hey, guys. My apartment isn't anywhere near here.

1061
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:30,420
It's not even on the same island.

1062
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:32,690
Days...

1063
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:34,250
months...

1064
01:28:34,330 --> 01:28:35,990
years.

1065
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:37,720
Always face it forward.

1066
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:49,940
I've just been down the gullet of an interstellar cockroach, kid.

1067
01:28:50,010 --> 01:28:52,670
That's one of a hundred memories that I don't want.

1068
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,460
See you around, Jay.

1069
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:18,970
No...

1070
01:29:19,470 --> 01:29:21,240
you won't.

1071
01:29:56,680 --> 01:30:01,140
Zed called. The Solaxiant 9 consulate wants floor seats for the Knicks game.

1072
01:30:01,210 --> 01:30:03,940
Put in a call for Dennis Rodman, he's from that planet.

1073
01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:07,710
Rodman? You're kidding.

1074
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:09,250
Nope.

1075
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:11,620
Not much of a disguise.

1076
00:00:00,-750 --> 00:00:00,-750


1077
00:00:00,-750 --> 00:00:00,-750
